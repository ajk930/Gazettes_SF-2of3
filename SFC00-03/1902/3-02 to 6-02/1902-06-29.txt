those whose minds are more or less
clouded as the result of the hell of war.
Those who ; are comparatively sound In

all the freedom possible to vary the mo

have lived lives of action, and many of
whom have been toilers in the business
fields of the. world, this long looking
backward is a thing that makes them
often dissatisfied with themselves and all
the earth besides. Many of them have
families or relatives comparatively near,
and the veteran would be with them but
for his disabilities. But now, as the full
summer days come, In many . cases he
takes his longest furlough of ninety days
and goes to his friends or where he will.
Many take the three months and do what
work they can on a ranch. Their, days
are not confined to. the home limits, for

veterans at Yountville, where about
e'ght hundred make their home, is one of
the most. beautiful in point of picturesque
location of the many in the United States.
There are few others where outdoor life
can be lived so pleasurably and freely at
all seasons. Just now the valley is at Its
best. In the hills the buckeyes are scent
ing the air and the brake ferns are wav
ing their fronds.' The springs still bub
ble, and sweet scents come on every
breeze. Nine hundred and ten acres make
up the grounds of the home and contain
aaany a nook where Nature's wild loveli
.-Â¦css Is still undisturbed. This home was
*uilt largely by popular subscription, on
the same plan as was the Soldiers' Home
at Bath, N. Y. It was opened as a State
home m April, 1884, and also receives

the last gun of the war. His old heart
throbs in martial echo as he falls asleep,

other day marked by memories from the
past.

foulness of trenches filled with the ghast

fuces that lie in pitiful dumbness, with
staring eyes, was that of the. friend or
brother that he loved.
The hills merge into the "eternal land
scape of the past," and from them gleam
campfires. It is not the bugle that sounds
as the colors ripple downward, but the
screech of shells. The June air stirs and
thickens to hotness. It is no longer a
misty valley of peace that the moistened
eyes of the veteran gaze into, but the
jÂ»rcoke of carnage of toe lieid of Gettys
burg.
Sometimes at the sunset hour in this
peaceful country, when the stars and
Â¦tripes are lowered to the strains of
"The * Star-spangled Banner," the scene
changes before the eyes of the soldiers,

There, are a goodly number of men who
are still well enough in body to enjoy the
many amusements provided for them at
the home. Bowling is a favorite game
among them and some 'veterans are ex
perts. There is a Filipino who is an un
deniable winner * at billiards. A favorite
pastime is fishing, and others go camp-
Ing and often- sleep out of doors. Hunt-
Ing squirrels and, small game is another
diversion. Armless and legless veterans
are here in plenty, but It was not in ail
cases the war that caused thÂ«- loss. The

THE OLD SOLDIER AT HOMEwinning with the king, queen, Jack or ten
respectively means no more, except where
the return is the master card. In this
case It may be no more or four originally.
No one will dispute the statement that
when partner leads trumps from strength
you will hold three more often than four,
aa the chances are that your partner has
led from at least five. If so, there are
eight distributed between, the three re
maining hands, and. there is every
reason that the | partner . of the strong
trump hand will hold less than four cards
of the suit more often than three. There
fore the preference is given the three
card echo.
various forms of this echo hare been
In use. At first it was used to show three
to a lead from a high card sequence only,
since euch a lead meant either three high
cards, or unusual length In the leader's
hand. The danger of third hand having
to sacrifice a valuable card, as the inter
mediate of three, was minimized. Devices
were shortly afterward Introduced by
whist experts whereby it proposed
to distinguish between three or more than
three. The following Is the mode of the
three-trump echo in general use at pres
ent â the three-trump echo only con
sists of showing three trumps by the
same method which formerly meant four:
Partner having led from atrength, you
holding three trumps, you will, unless en
deavoring to win the trick,play the second
highest and then play the lowest. It
sometimes happens that this play sacri
fices a valuable card. In this case you
should forego the echo. For example,
partner leads the ace, either because of
length cf cult cr for the purpose of get
ting out two immediate rounds of trumps.
It would be the greatest folly to echo
with any of the following combinations:
King, Jack, gix; queen. Jack, four; king,
ten, three, etc. Exact knowledge of your
trumps is deducible by Inference from
your failure under ordinary conditions to
echo, which of itself Indicates more or
less than three. In this case your partner
can usually ascertain from the fall of the
two rounds the exact number you hold.
Tjm echo to show three was intro
duced by Dr. H. H. Green of Craw
fordsville, lad., In 1SS6, and has been
accepted by the majority of Amer
ican whist players. Slnoe then

If it does not, a later return or an at
tempt to win the trick will. The, principle
of returning the higbest.of three and the
lowest of four in connection with the
above makes it a complete doctrine, as
sound as any connected with the game.
Its elaboration enables you to show two,
three, four or five trumps. Its only draw
back is the uncertainty between two and
four, but the drop of the cards In nearly
all cases aids In determining the number.
the three-card echo only no signal
means two or four, as the play of the two
and then the four. The play of the four
and then the two would Indicate one bet
ter than the four. The play of two, five
and then the four would Indicate five,
winning with the ace, king, queen or
jack, and returning respectively king,
queen, jack or ten would . Indicate one
more only. While winning with the king,
queen, Jack or ten and returning (barring
return. of master trump) low would Indi
cate four at least. Returning the ace,
king, cueen. or jack Immediately after
It will at once be seen that with two
indifferent high cards the three-card echo
can be made as clear as with low cards.
Especially Is this so If the high card
holds the trick.
For example, partner leads ace and king
of trumps, to which the adversaries fol
low. You play the two, then three, but
the four falls to drop. You must have
it and at least one more. In showing the
three trumps the echo must be carried
through all the phases and possible com
binations of the original third hand to the
trump leader. As an illustration, winning
with the king, and returning queen,
meant four trumps formerly. With the
system under discussion it means three in
stead of four. â¢'.'

** Y O bettw objoct lesson for the

A \ subject under varying conditions
>â¢â¢; of light and shade. The average
beginner starts out with the Idea that a
view Is a. view, and that's all there Is to
it. Let hfm. If he has the desire to learn
something of photography, confine him
self for a few days to the definite study
of a single selected subject, making abso
lute photographs of it from the same view
point but under different lightings, say,
exposing one plate in the early morning,
another at j mid | forenoon, a third at high
noon; another; in the afternoon and still
another at * early, evening. Carefully de
velop and print each j of these negatives
and compare . the : finished results, using
the experience thus gained as a guide to
future work. It will probably be found
that while one or possibly two of the
views are \ good, the , others will be far in
ferior, aa the source of light, Its direction
and intensity are very Important features
in the composition : and arrangement of a
view." Almost any subject may be taken
for this study, and it la' recommended Luat
the beginner go not far from home for
this purpose. It Is Important that all the
views be taken under the same general

this may be prosaic work it will, more
than repay, one for the trouble expended

they who carefully study their subject be
fore exposing thÂ» plate irpon It. often go
ing many times In the atudy of a certain
Bit or acenery before allowing themselves
to mako a single exposure. The result of
this care in selection Is, however, appar
ent in their work and its importance can
not be too strongly urged upon earnest
students, as carelessness in this particula
produces a continuation of carelessness
throughout all succeeding manipulations
and engenders a general lowering of qual
ity in every case.
In the increasing importance attaching
to photography and its recognition in the
circle ofc. art productions, every user of
the camera should feel a personal Interest
In keeping the standard of his work hi-h
and making every output a credit to him
self.
Too much attentibn cannot be paid in
landscape ,. photography to the point of
view from which the exposure is made
and the composition of the picture itself.
A little attention to this- matter will show
the beginner how much difference results
in. the, pictorial value of the photograph
from correct or Incorrect point of view.
The composition should be caref ullj
studied on the ground glass, or in the
case of film cameras, on the finder and
the position of the camera changed from
right to left or, from a lower to a higher
point until the -picture Is found to com
pose to the best advantage. This mat
ter of , selecting a view should have the
most careful study, if being fully as Im
portant as any other part of the process.

whether the sun Is shining brightly or Is
partially obscuredâ the size of diaphragm

fractions of a second, will gtv* the opera
tor material upon which to base all: bis
future work. If later, after the negative
is developed, a further entry is made in
the book embodying the results obtained
under the conditions shown. by the pre
vious records, he knows at once what
kind of a negative to expect if the condi
tions are repeated. A notebook- of this

It of a good, deep color. After allowing it
to dry it should agam be gone over with
a coat of shoe blacking such . as Is used
on the finer qualities* of leather.
It is probable that no mistake is more
prevalent in the use of the camera than
that of attempting to mak^ a very large
number of exposures in a very short time.
The enthusiast, who, starting out for a '

"It's rum, however, which final is the
destruction of Bowlaigs, same as it is of
plenty of other people who would have
else lived in honor an' died respected an'
been tearfully planted in manner an' form
to do 'em. proud. Exclooslve of that ca
soolty which marks â¢ his wind-up an'
which, as I states, he combines with
Major Ben to commit, thar's but one ac
tion of Bowlalgs which a enemy might
call a crime. He does pounce on a mail
bag one evenln' when the postmaster
ain't lookin' an' shore rends an' worrits
them letter scand'Ious.
" 'For I, of all gents, Bowlalgs,' says
Texas, as he invites the foogitive to the
bar, 'onderstands what you all's been
through. It may be imagination, but jest
the came, thar's them times when Missis
Rucker goes on the warpath when she
reminds me a lot of my divorced Laredo
wife.' With that, as , yeretof ore chroni
cled, Texas pours a couple of hookers of
Willow Run into Bowlaigs, an* the latter
is tharby a heap cheered an' | his pulse de
clines to normal.
"BowlaigE. who's plumb scared, comes
lumberin' our to the Rod Light an' puis
himse'f onder our protection. Enright
sauar'^ it I'or him; for when Misses
Rucker appears subsequent with a "Win
chester an* a knife an' gives it .out coid
she's goin' to get Bowia:gs' hide an' tal
low an' sell 'em to play even for that din
in'-room desolation he's the architect of,
Enright counts up the damage an' pays
over J23 In full tettlement. Doea Bow
laigs know It? \ou can gamble the limit
he knows it; for all the time Missis
Rucker is in the Red Light denouncin'
him, he secretes h:n:se'f, shivcrin', behind
the bar; an' when that lady withdraws,
mollified an' subdotd by the money, he
creeps out, Bovriaigs does, an' cries an'
licks Enright's hand. Oh, he's a mighty
appreciative b'ar, pore Bowlaigs is; but
his nerves is that onstiung by the perils
he passes through with Missis Rucker it
takes two big drinks to recover his sperits
an' make him feel like the same b'ar. It's
Texas Thompson who buys the drinks.
"Still, I'll fur that most esteemable
lady that Micsis Rucker never lays for
Bowlaigs or as.Â«auUs him ontil one after
noon when he catches the dinin' room de
serted an' off Its gyard .in" goes, romancin'
over, catfcot an' surreptitious, an" cleans
up the tables of what chuck has been
placed thar In antic'pation of supper. The
first news Missis Rucker has oi" the raid
Is when Bowlaigd gets a halt-hitch on the
table-cloth an' winds up his play by yank-
In' the entire outfit of spoons, tin platen
an' crockery off onto the floor. It's then
Missis Rucker saliies from the kitchen an'
puts Bowlaigs to flight.
"The first real trouble that meets up
with Bowlaigs â who's goi to be a y'ar
old by nowâ since Jennie fjgftts. the dooel
with him with that broom, overtakes him
at the O. K. Restauraw. MUsis Rucker
for one thing ain't over fon-i of. Bowlaigs.
allegin' as he grows older, day by day.
he looks more an" more li'.to Rucker. Of
course, sech view? is figrnents as much
as them alarms of Tucson Jennie about
Bowlaigs merlitatin' gettin' away with lit
tle Enrisht Pcets; but Mldsis Rucker in
spite of whatever we gent folk can say
in Bowlaigs' behalf, believes firm in her
ov.n slanders. She asserts that Bowlaigs.
as he onfo^ls, looks like Rucker; an' for
her at least, that settles the subject, an'
she SLSS&omes towards Bowlaigs attitoodes
which would have been proper had her
charge been troo.
"Existence goes flowin' onward like
some, glad sweet song for Bowlaigs. for
mighty likely It's two months an' nothin 1
remarkable eventuates. - He camps in over
to the corral, an' except that new oonies,
who ain't onto Bowlalgs, commonly has
heart failure at the sight of him, he don't
found no disturbances nor get in any
body's way. Throughout his wnkin'
hours, as I su'gests former," 'Howlaigs
ha'nts about the Red Light, layin' guile
ful â¢ an' cunnin' for invites to tfrink an'
execoots besides small excursions to the.
O. IC Restauraw for chuck, with now an'
then a brief Journey to the post office or
the New York store. These visits of Bow
laigs to, the last two places, both because
he don't get no letters at the post office
an' don't demand no clothes at the store,
I attributes to motives of morbid cur'os
ity, that a-way.
" 'An' Bowlalgs has this distinction,'
says Black Jack, alloodin' to the sugar
and water: 'he's shore the only gent for
whom I so far onbends from reg'lar rules
as to mix drinks.'
for that of either Hugglna or Old Monte,
an* them two sots i for long known
as far west as the Colorado an' as far
no'th as the Needles as the prize drunk
ards of Arizona. No; Bowlaigs ain't
equal/ to pourin' down the raw nose
pair.t; but Plack Jack numors his weak
ness an' Bowla'g- Is wont to take off
his libations abcut two parts water to
one of whisky an' a lump o" sugar in
the bottom, outen ore o' these big tum
bler glasses, standin' at the bar' an'
holdln' the glass between his two paws
an' all as ackerate *n' steady as the
most talented inebriate.
ThÂ« Major only lira* a half hour after
we gets thar. An* it's to his credit that
he makes a statement exoneratln' Bow
lalgs. 1 don't, want yon-all genta,' says
the Major, *to get deemm* hard of this
b'ar, for what fault thar is. Is mine. Sine*
Texas Thompson picks up that dollar, this
thing is mad* plain. What I Â»ti v w> for
gratootlous wickedness on Bowlaixs* part
Is nothin' but his efforts to execoote my
desires. Pore Bowlalgs! It embitters my
last moments as I pictures, what mu*t
have been hia opinions of me when 1 1Â«^
loose on him with that knifat Bury oa
In one grave, gents; It'll save trouble aaÂ»
show besides that thar's no hard feelin's
between me an' Bowlaigs over whatâ an*
grre It the worst nameâ ain't nothin* but
a onfortunate mistak*,"
/ :
"Shore there's a fight, an' the Major
rets the knife plumb to Bowlalgs* honest
heart with the first motion. But Bowlaigs
Quits game; he turns with a warwiioop
an' confers on the Major a swat that
would have broke the back of a brtmoa,
an' then h# die* with his teeth la tins Ma
jor's neck.
â¢The first p'inter the Major gets of a
new deal In his destinies Is a grand crash
as the entire teepee upheaves an' goes
over, kerwallop! on Its side, hurlln' the
Major out through the canvas What's
happened? Why, simply this: When
Bowlaigs gets outside, he finds he can't
crawl under the teepee none, seeln' it'Â»
settln' too clost to the ground; an* soâ
bein' a one ideed b'ar, that a-wayâ hÂ©
sort o' runs his right arm In an* up-ends
the entire sheban g, same aa his old mother
would a log when she's grub-huntta' in
the bills. Bowlalgs Is pickin* up the acu
lar when the Major comes chargtn* "round
the rooms of his outfit, a benrio in his
hand, an* him fa'rly locoed with rage.
"Now this here Bowlaigs Is a mighty
sagacious b'ar, an' so he goes wallowin,'
forth plenty prompt to recover the dollar.
The Major, who's ignorant of what's hap
pened, still rolls groanln' in his blankets
nursln' his feelln's.
"One mornin* after Bowlaigs an' the
Major's been campin' together abcut four
months they wakes up mighty wretched.
They've had a onusual spree the even'n"
prior an' they feels like a couple of sore
head dogs. The Major, who needs a
drink to line up on for the day, gropes
about In his blankets, gets a dollar,
pitches It into the basket an' orders
Bowlalgs to caper off for the Willow
Run. Bowlaigs Is nothin* loth; but as
he's about to pick up the basket he ob
serves that the dollar has done bounred
out an* fallen through a crack In â¢ r he
floor. Bowlalgs ' sees it through the samÂ»
crack, where It's layin' shlnin' onder the
house.
"The dispoote between rcwiVgs an'
the Major, which results in both of 'em
cashin' in. get3 started erroneous. The
Majorâ who's sometimes too Indolent an'
sometimes too drunk to make the play
himse'fâ instructs Bowlalgs how to go
over to the Red Light an' fetch a bottle
of rum. The Major would chuck a silver
dollar in a little basket an* Bowlai^s
would take it In his mouth, same as you
all has seen dogs, an' report with the "lay
out to Black Jack. That gent would
make the shift, an' Bowlaigs would ree
pair back ag'in to the Major, when they'd
both tank up ecstatic.
"The Major's got a diminyootive wick
eyup out to the r'ar of the . corral, an'
him an' Bowlaigs resides tharin. This
habitat of the Major an' Bowlaigs ain't
much bigger than a Saratoga trunk; it'*
only eight foot by ten, is made of barn
boards an' has a canvas roof. That's the
kind of ranch Bowlaigs an' the Major
calls home; the latter spreadin' his blank
ets on one side, while Bowlaigs sleeps on
t'other on the- board floor, necdln* no
blankets, seeln' he's got fur.
" "Which If all my friends,' says the
Major, no doubt alloodln' to them wit
nesses ag'Iii him when he's cashiered,
'couldn't have talked no more than Bow
lalgs. I'd been happy yet.'
"But the end is on its lowerin'. way for
Bowlaigs. : Thar's a senile party who's
packed his blankets into camp an' who's
called Major. Ben. The Major, so the
whisper goes, used to be quartermaster
over to Fort Craig or Fort Apache, or
mebby now it's Fort Cumminga or
som'ers; an'- he gets himse'f dismissed for
makin* away with the bank roll. Be that
as it may, the Major's plenty drunk an'
military while he lasts among us; an' he
likewise has dlnero 'or whatever nose
pelnt an' food an' faro bank he sees fit
to go ag'lnat. From the jump the Major
makes up to Bowlaigs, ,an' the two be
comes pards. The Major allows he likes
Bowlaigs because he can't talk.
Peets an' the Colonel, vie a.i can be con
sidered as hangin' mighty anxious on
what reply Doc Peets to goln' to make. But
after some thought Peets agrees with the
Colonel. He admits that this 'causa lu
cra* la a bet he overlooks, an' that now
the Colonel draws his attention to it he' 3
bound to say he believes the Colonel to
be right an' that Bowlalgs should be
made a free, onfettered b'ar ag'in. We
breathes easier at this, for the tension
has been great, an' Dan himse'f Is that
relieved he comes a heap clost to shed
din' tears. The trial closes with the cus
tomary drinks; Bowlaig3 gettin' his forty
drops with the rest, on the hocks of which
he signalizes his reestora,tlon to his rights
an' freedom as a citizen by quilin' up In
bis corner an' goln' to sleep.
"What!" I Interjected; "don't you con
sider the divers killingsâ the death of the
Stinging Lizard and "the dismissal of Sil
ver Phil, to cay nothing of the taking off
of the Man from Red Dogâ don't you, I
tay, consider such bloody matters casual
ties r*
"No, sir," retorted my friend, emitting
the while sundry stubborn puffs of
smoke; "no, sir; 1 regyards them as re
sults. Tharfore, I reiterates that this
yere Major Ben an' Bowlaigs accom
plishes between 'em the only troo casoo
alty whereof Wolfville has a record."
At this he paused and surveyed me
with an rye of challenge. After a bit,
perceiving that I rroposed no further con
tradiction, he went on:
"This Billy Bowlaigs at first is a cub
b'arâ a black cub b'ar; an' when he's
grown up to manhood, bo to epeak, he's
as big an' mighty near as strong, physi
cal, as Dan Boggs. Nacherally, however,
Dan lays over Bowlalgs mental like a
ace-full.
"It's Dave Tutt who makes Bowlalgs
captive; Dave rounds Bowlalgs up in his
Infancy one time when he's pesterln'
about over In the foothills of the Floridas
lookin' for blacktail deer. Dave meets up
with Bowlaige an' the latter's mother out,
evident, on a scout for grub. Bowlalgs'
mother has jest upturned a rotten pine
log to give little Bowlaigs a chance to
rustle some of these yere egreeglQiin
white worms which look like bald cata
p.'llare, that a-way, when all at once
around a p'lnt of rocks Dave, heaves in
view. This parent of Bowlalgs is as be
eotted about her son as many hooman
mothers; for while Bowlalgs stands al
most as high as ehe does, an' weighs
clost onto two hundred pounds, the moth
er b'ar still has the Idee tangled up in
her Intelligence that Bowlalgs Is that
email an' he'pleES, day-old kittens Is
Be'f-Eustalrin' citizens by compar'son to
him. Acthi" on these errors, Bowlaigs'
mother the moment she glimpses Daw
grabs young Bowlalgs by the scruff of
the neck an' goes caperin* off'up hill with
him. An' to give that parent b'ar full
credit she's gcttln' along all ri^ht an 1
conductln' hcrse'f as though Bowiaigs
don't heft no more than one of them
gooseha'r pillows, when, accidental, she
bats pore Bowlalgc ag'in the bole of a
treeâ him hangin' outen her mouth about
three footâ an 1 while the collision shakes
that monarch of the forest some, Bow
lalgs gets knocked free of her grip an'
goes rcllin' down the mountainside ag'in
like a bag of bran. It puts quite a crimp
in Bowlalgs. The mother b'ar, full of
e'licltood^ .to save her offspring, turns an'
charges Dave; tharupon Dave downs her
an' younp Bowlaips becomes a orphan an'
a pris'ner on the spot.
"Followin" the demise of Bowlaigs'
mother, Dave pert o' feels responsible for
tho cub's bringin' up. an' so he ties him
hand an' foot, an after peelin' the pelt
from the old mother b'ar. packs the
entire outfit into camp. Dave's pony
protests with green eyes ag'in carrying
6ech freight, but Dave has his way", as
he usually does with everything except
Tucson Jennie.
"At first Dave allows he'll let Bow
laigs live with him a whole lot an* keep
him ontll he grows up and make a pet
of him. But as I more than once
makes plain, Dave proposes but Tucson
Jennie disposes; an' so it befalls that
on the third day after the cub takes
up his residence with her and Dave, Jen
nie arms herse'f with a broom and har
asses the onfortunate Bowlaigs from her
wickeyup. Jennie declare* that she dis
covers Bowlaigs organizin' to devour her
child Enright Peets Tutt, who's at that
epock comin' three years the next spring
round-up.
" *I could read it in that Bowlaigs
b'ar*s eyes,' says Jennie, 'an' it's mighty
lucky a parent's faculties is plumb keen.
If I hadn't got In on the play with my
broom, you can bet that inordinate Bow
lalgi would have done eat little Enright
PeÂ«tÂ» all up.'
"Shore, no one credits these yere ap
prehensions of Jennie's; Bowlalgs would
no more have chewed up Enright Peets
than he'd played poker with him.; but
* toad mother's fears once stampeded is
not to be headed off or ca'med, so, of
course, Bowlalgs has to shift his camp
a heap.
"Bowlaigs takes up his abode on the
heels of him beln' run out by Tucson
Jennie, over to the corral; that Is, he
beaks In thar temp'rary at least. An'
he ebons grows amazln' and enlarges

A PAGE OF HERRICK
IF the man with the lifelong habit of
regarding all masculine apparel as
peculiarly and inalienably his own
will wake up and take notice of tht
trend of fashion this season he will
be amazed and perhaps not a little bit
shocked to discover that the garment of
all garments which he has hitherto hel>j
as secretly inviolate from encroachment
of the fair sex is no longer his own.
The "pajama girl" has become some
thing more real than the caricatures in
the comic papers have made her out :o
be. j/:''5/v*Â«>:
Moreover, she is come to stay, and in
roch rapidly increasing numbers that the
manufacturer and the retailer, with an
eye to inflate dividends in the future, have
found that it is her pride and her prej
udice which must now be given first con
rloexation.
And, like the bloomer costume for' wo
men cyclers and the automobile coat
for fair "autoneers," the pajama for wo
men has followed the devious way of evo
lution until it has become this year a
truly resplendent creation.
Of course, it was designed originally foi
men, to be worn only on occasions where
the ordinary and ofttlmes all too abbre
viated nightgown was very inconvenient,
to say the least, such as railroad an<>
steamboat travel, where dressing and un
dressing has become something of a fine
art.
Then, of course, true to his reputation
for logicâ and comfortâ masculine man
reasoned that if pajamas were such con
venient gknaente for traveling, the>
ought to be equally convenient for use
at home. Presto, sudden popularity fci
the pi.^a.
And LJicn, vrith logic in no wise inferior
to that <if rp;..-:_u.ine man, even though
it ha:- heretofore always been* denied at
an attribute of. the gentler sex, the sis
ters and wives ar.d oaufc'bters of the "pa
jV.mz mar." reascaed that if he could Iooh
so cozy and comfortable in the new gar
ment, v. i.y should not the women adopi
the costume, loo?
Presto, stfll greater popularity for thÂ«
I'ajama, until the- masculine man who vis
ited his favorite haberdasher, Roos Bro*.
for instance, who kindly loaned the pa
jamas Fhown on this page, had to elbow
his way through an ever-increasing crowd
of Â¦women to reach the counter or stand
and listen to some such conversation at
this while patiently and dodlely waiting
his turn: /
"Could I see some â ahâ umâ pajamas,
please? For a present? Noâ that la
you see â oh, yes; how stupid of meâ #
present for myâ umâ younger brother
Tes, he is just about my height. Ah, yes,
Poses by Eleanor Falk and
Company at the Orpheum.
Pajamas From Boos Bros.
those white ones are very pretty, but
ahâdon't you think theâ ahâ legs are a
little too long?
"And haven't you something In brighter
color*â something fancier T TeÂ»; let me
see something In red; or haven't you any
thing in pale blue? Oh. that Is pretty!
But these look so small and narrow.
Haven't you a little wider pair? Yes, my
"brother Is quiteâ : um- plump. And^yesâ
haven't you something with embroidery
or -hemstitching or lace orâ oh, dear, yea;
of course; I , forgot. : Men don't wear
them fancy like that, do they? How silly
of me! Perhaps you can show me some
thing in fancy colors. Ah, those stripes
are beautiful, aren't they? I think I'll
. take those."
(And the stripes referred to, whioh have
become quite the . fad with the pajama
girl, are certainly very ohlo. Tou shall
hear more about them, presently. '
And now the pajama has found its way
upon the stage. That in itself Is suffi
cient to make it all the rage, for Dame
Fashion has a way; all j her own of dis
playing behind , the alluring footlights
those garments which she desires to make
most popular." It is a very clever little
scheme, and It never fails to work, for
women are said to be born Imitators, and
never lose an opportunity to emulate the
manners and . dress Â¦ of their stage favor
ites. ; . _ Â¦ '
The pajama girl on the stage is a post-
uve novelty, ana as seen' in her variety is
the, most coquettlshly fascinating crea
ture imaginable. There are "pajama
chorus girls,'^ "pajama ballets," "pajama
girl sextets," "pajama girls at col
lege," - "pajama girls at the beach," and
all wearing the very latest in night robes
in a manner that would have been con
sidered truly shocking only a few years
mtÂ°. Â¦ : i Â¦.. ; Â¦ Â¦Â¦ : Â¦ ... .
In New York one of the biggest stage
successes since Florodora was a dormi
tory scene in which all the chorus dis
robed in the dark and when the lights
were again turned up were discovered dis
porting 1 tbemsalvw under and over and
around and about a long Una of white
enamel trundle beds, . for; all the world
like the pranks of college girls after the
"light out" bell has been sounded.
And now here at our own theater we have
been startled by ] Eleanor/ Falk and her
ten merry. pajama girls, who have proved
to be one of the best novelties seen at the
Orpheum In ! many a . season. There are
tall girls and short girls, plump girls and
slender girls, but. they are all pajama
girls, and when they burst . out upon the
stage with the air of a summer girl wear
ing her/ first French , bathing suit on a
crowded beach, the effect Is nothing short*
of electrifying, especially the frollo which
accompanies the song of "Pajama Polly."
. There are ; pajamas of madras and pa
jamas of silk. There are cool pajamas of
linen and. lawn, and warm pajamas of
flannel and mercerized cheviot. -There are
odd creations in shiny sateen and striking
pajamas in soft silk mixtures. There are,
pajamas that are plain red, yellow, blue,
tan, white or green, , and pajamas that
have all the hum of the rainbow. There
is no : article of Â¦ adornment and personal
convenience which fair woman has ap
propriated unto herself that comes in as
many varieties a* the pajama, and the
prices â well, there are pajamas that cost
$10, $15 and $20 a pair and other pajamas
which may be had for H.
Some of the prettiest are of silk, soft
and . clinging and as daintily becoming as
the filmy robes of an Oriental princess.
Just look on the center picture of this pic
ture, the large one In which the pajama
chorus is grouped about Miss Falk. There
you have all sorts and combinations of
colors and designs to choose from.
The pajamas worn by Miss Falk are of
pink and white madras in alternating
stripes, outlined with fancy stitching of
silk in contrasting colors. When worn by
a girl as graceful and plump as Miss Falk
the effect Is quite fetching. Another
picture of Miss Falk, seated on the t table,
Is shown on the bottom of this page, at
tired in a natty suit of mixed silk and
wool pajamas, in red and white. .>.*>Â¦;>'Â¦"
Another striking combination Is of tan
linen trimmed with broad bands of red
a la militalre. This suit is nothing if
not jaunty, arid the two' pockets in the
blouse make it the very sauciest garment
imaginable.
Daring effects are most popular with
women, for it isjan odd circumstance that
were it not for the pajama girl the men
would have been quite well satisfied to
wear the apparel In any material and any
color so it be composite. But the pajama
girl, with an eye. for effect as well as
comfort, wanted something pretty, as well
as practical. Hence the daring effects.
Any casual observer of the most popular
designs in hosiery during the past few
seasons would have no difficulty in fore
casting what would please the pajama
girl.
Two of the most striking are worn by

THE
PAJAMA
GIRLHave somebody select a card from an
ordinary pack and, after looking at it,
place it on top of the pack. Place the
pack in a pasteboard box -just large
enough to hold it; put the . cover over It;
A few moments later the box is opened,
the pack is taken out and laid aside; a
sealed envelope is shown to the audience,
and, when opened, the card selected by
the partner is pulled out of it.
The small pasteboard - box must be
made in such a way that it can Just hold
the whole" pack of cards, as . shown in A.
Inside the cover paste a small piece of
wax, to which the uppermost card will
stick when the cover* is put on the box.
When the box is opened again, this card
must be removed secretly and hidden
in the palm of the hand. The envelope
is empty. Place the card behind it,
while you cut the envelope open and pre
tend you pull the card out. . This trick
if well done is very deceptive, as B shows.

ent sizes, a dollar, a. ten-cent piece and a
half dollar, by sticking them together

horse, and then the fun begins. The ser
vices of a helper or two are necessary to
get the thirty-five pound saddle in place,
and it would take a dozen If the horse
was not blindfolded. It takes, only a
second to slip a 'haccomo,' or horsehair
halter, over the beast's - head, and then
comes the task of getting Into the saddle.
A good 'bronco buster' gets his leg over
before the * horse knows that anything Is
doin'. -, Then the helpers turn the horse
loose, and he starts buckln' without wait-
Ing to think about it. He pitches and
jumps and tries to turn backfllps, for all
the world like a small boat in a big storm.
Then he i will take a turn at pawing the'
ground and kicking with his front feet.
Perhaps- he will jump into the air and
come down on the solid ground with all
four legs rigid. The whole business simply
means that he wunts to get you oft hi3

, "And .were you ever thrown?" the re
porter asked.
"Was I ever throwed?" replied the cow
boy. "Well. I guess, yes. The hair that
grows on a horse's back falls off at times,
to say nothing of a man. The best of cow- '
â¢ punchers /git throwed once In a while.
There's more than one way of stlckin' to
a bucking horse, however. Some keep their
feeats by grlppln' the saddle with the
knees, others depend on their spurs, and
then again there are punchers who hold
on by the reins. A good cowpuncher don't
have any set rule. He just rides loose like
and is ready for anything that comes,
even to gettin' throwed once In a spell.
"Speakin 1 of gettin' throwed reminds me
of poor 'Charley' Wilson and his fatal ex
perience with a man killln' 'bronc' out on
Captain King's ranch. Santa Aertrules.
Tex. He was breakin' In a raw-boned
â¢critter that was about as wild as any I
ever see. He had been ridln' the beast a
couple . of hours when he came past the
corral on the jump. Â¦
"Wantln' to show off before the boys,
he dug his spurs Into the big bay's
shoulders, and in about a second he was
out of the saddle. He would hnva been
all right. If he hadn't caught his foot in
the stirrup. That settled it for him. The
horse saw him hangin' there, and rushed
off Into tho brush, kickin' at his poor
body every once in a while. We picked
his body up in pieces, here and there,
where the wild critter had dragged him.
Then we gave him the best j sort of a
funeral we could.
"The : horse -became an outlaw and we
hunted him for weeks before we discov
ered him in the midst of the herd. Poor
Wilson's saddle, or rather what was left
of it, was hangin* under the brute's belly,
and the girths had made such a sore
place on his back that we had to shoot
him. It don't pay to show off when
you're breakin' broncos. I used to do It,
but no more for 'Jack.'
"I helped break my first horse when I
was 9 years old, and I've, been breaking
them ever since. I don't mind breaking
real wild, horses, . but deliver me from the
kind that have been spoiledâ that Is,
horses that have mastered some man. I'd
rather break six wild horses than one
that has heen spoiled."

which is : attracting "great attention
abroad: . ;.'-. . . . ;Â¦Â¦ .
; "Prince . Galitzln, one of the richest of
Russian nobles, 'was playing 1 on one occa
sion with the. most" persistent bad luck.
Estates, serf s, : revenues, town houses,
furniture, jewels, everything .had been
swallowed up. He had nothing left but
his carriage. 'That waa waiting for him
outside; he staked It and lost that In a
few throws of . the dice. A few minutes
afterward . the horses were also gone..
" 1 did not stake' the harness,' he said.
'It is all in silver and has Just come from
St. Petersburg." . .' .
"His adversary nodded and a 'game was
begun for the harness. At that moment,
though, the luck turned as completely in
the Prince's favor as a few momenta pre
viously It had been against him. In a
few hours he not only won back the
horses, the carriage and the family Jew
els, but everything else he had lost bo
rapidly, and that, thanks to the harness,
which literally seemed to be attached to
the wheel of fortune."

Goldstone was one of these fads. It
was a composition that looked like gold

stone bracelet of this old trousseau had
bands of gold, and surmounting these
waa a great ornament of goldstone. It
was the day of pairsâ a pair of vases, a.
pair of water colors, a pair of bracelets.
So the belle of then who was lucky
enough to possess a goldstone bracelet
was sure to have two of them, arid it

as long as that of the average gown of

present day. Below this are. long pointed

But this black silk of a yeeter season
Ltanrfs by itself to-day as firmly as it
ever d:d. It is rich and gleaming in its
folds and sound in Its breadths. It Is
splendidly, glitteringly jetty black, too,
fur the dyes of that day were a vast deal
belter than ours. . i .
For at the rate of 94 a yard it took a
very neat sum to cover the price of a
gown. The jowns were alarmingly bigâ
cxtiavagantly big, as the household pro
vider looked at it. They measured count
less yards around the skirt, for they had
to be big enough to surround the hoops
of the period. And the sleeves were huge
things that flowed out and down and back
and forthâ any way so that they flowed.
The black silk of tfie pictured wardrobe
is as firm to-day as it ever was. That Js
one of the most wonderful things about
the garments of this precious trousseau;
the fabrics of that period were so sub
saantiaily good that they have endured
a. most unbroken through all these years.
What will our, present day gowns be as
many years hence?- Â¦â Even those of the
best 'materials wear ; and fade on our
backs. Our children and grandchildren
win find the relics of them fit lor their
}>atchwork quilts and nothing else. The
tnfifta v/ill be in ribbons, the smart tailor
c-joLumes of swagger cloths will have
faded, the dimities and osgafirtUn will
bave--.rctted-e.way. Â¦Â¦'Â¦
Thuik of it- Think of what that meant
to our mothers and grandmothers. Bless
their dear hearts, how they must have
done without sugar for their tea and tea
for their sugar. They must have saved
for weeks ahead. They must have made
over all their other gowns to save enough
for the new black silk.
There was some reason for this, as you
caii realize when you take into account
the price. Money was harder to spend in
thÂ»se days anyway; a dollar was a dozen
times as big as It is now. In the light of
i his tact, then, the gros grain silk of that
l-eriod cost H a yard.
Nothing was half as splendid for a re
ciption gown as the black silk. In fact,
there was a sort of halo hanging over the
black silk in those days. It was taken
much more seriously than ermine would
be in this day and generation.

An exquisite little lace collar finishes
the neck. It is as perfect of its kind as
all the lace wear of that time was. It
would have been a disgrace for any one
to have worn cotton lace.
"The first time I had a bit of cotcon
lace on one of my garments I felt as dis
graced as if I had been sent to ja ; l,"
Mrs. Gracey says. "I thought cotton lace
was meant for darkies. It had never oc
curred to me that a white lady, one of
'the Quality," could wear it until one of
*ny friends, a woman who had always
heen extremely fastidious, took to it ami

people had- much of it.^but that little
went further toward decorating a ?own

dainty collars laid away in an old-time

The one that goes with this grown simu
lates a square neck in shape. It Is mauo
of fine little bands of real lace and em
broidery laid in alternate stripes. j
The hair ornament that goes with this
gown is a simple band of black velvet
wrought In pearls. It passes twice
around the heaVi, crossing under the hair,
which Is worn low In the back- of tho
neck. Besides Jhis the wonderful old
ivory comb is worn sometimes. To a
black-haired beauty it is the most becom
ing thing that can possible be found.
The taffeta, house gown has withstood
the ravages of time in a wonderful way.
Any modern taffeta would have split into
a thousand ribbons long ago. It is of
a delicate lavender and white stripe. The
beauty of it is the taffeta trimming,
which, corresponds perfectly with it. The
colors of the silk are carried out in the
trimming. Whether the ladies of war
times called such garments pattern
gowns, as we do nowadays, is not report
ed, but we have nothing that is a bit
smarter of its kind.
This house gown fastens up the front,
skirt and all, although it is made in two
pieces. The .figured border follows the
bottom of the skirt all the way around

A TROUSSEAU OF HALF
A CENTURY
AGOOf courre, any postoffice clerk Is ex-^
ptcted to know that "Saniose." "Sanaza"*
or any of a score more o* variations
mean "San Jose." atfd that "Gachson" is
"Jackson," but it is generally up to the
"nixie" man to figure-out that "Avina
teama, Cal.," with the "t" not crossed,
means Vina, Tehama County, California.
That address is very common in the mail
The mailing room ol every newspaper in
town is practically a branch postofflce.
As the papers leave the machines they
are distributed in mail bags furnished by
the "postal authorities, and many of these
ba?s are not so much as opened at the
ferry station. All that is necessary is to
weigh them and put them on the dis-
The handling of papers and parcel* iÂ»
very much the same as the handling of
letters, except in the case of the dally
newspapers, which require little attention
at the hands of postoffice clerks.
Another never-ending source of an
noyance is the person who believes that
because a paper wrapper has a 1-cent
stamp on it one cent will carry any
amount of newspapers, from an ounce to
a pound. It won't, and the sooner peo
ple learn this the less they will have to
wonder why the.r friends do not get the
papers they mail them. Only first class
matter is forwarded without being tully
prepaid, and every day basketfuls of sec
ond and third class matter are destroyed
in the San Francisco office. Only where
the package is of obvious* value is a re
quest sent to the sender or the addressee
for postage necessary to forward.
â¢ Nobody would care very much about
the volume of this mall if the postage
were fully paid. But it is not. and there's
the rub. A large portion of it carries
only a 2-cent stamp. Miss Griffin would
be bankrupt If she attempted to pay the
postage due on all the cartloads of mail
she receives, and by the last steamer ten
sacks of it were returned to the San
Francisco office. She might give instruc
tions to have it held for postage, but the
instructions would apply only to that
v/hich bears the correct address; and
In four years' time, with thousands of dif
ferent persons reading and writing the
names the address has undergone so
many metamorphoses that only a "nixie"
man could guess that "Miss Treffy, Ma~
logny Mills, N. S. W.," was meant for
Miss Griffin cf Hurtsville. A few of the
hundreds of variations of Hurtsville are
Makmen Mildo, Nalys; Malsue Mills,
Huslescttg, Nashisitts; Mayron Mills,
Kcepsville, and iMontague, St. Hermits
Villa, N. S. W., Aus.
Â¦ No doubt the poor woman Is sorry now,
but it is too late. Certainly the postal
authorities are sorry. Steadily during the
four years the mail addressed to Miss
Griffin has Increased, until now the San
Francisco office forwards to her by each
steamer from five to seven sacks of mall,
or from 3300 to 5000 letters, all of whicri
are thick and heavy with stamps In
closed. It has been estimated that In the
United States alone the postage on letters
for Miss Griffin amounts to from $35 to $40
a . day, while from other countries it is
even more. ..,>.:.â¢.â¢Â¦
Then there is the chain-letter fiend. It
is now four year3 since Miss Audrey Grif
fin of Hurtsville, N. S. W., started a
chain-letter asking for canceled stamps.
Her purpose was charitable. . A rich man
In Hurtsville had told "her if she would
collect 1,000.000 canceled stamps he would
build a children's ward in a hospital
tbere, which at that timft had no accom
modations for children.

no one could begrudge him this much
help In the stupendous task of handling
the mall.
They must know through which port of
foreign countries the mail for the hun
dreds of interior towns enter, and they
must know it without stopping to think.
To prove how well they know all these
things, each man is brought to the super
intendent's office three or four, times a
year and given a case examination, which
means that he is put in a small room by
himself, with a glass door so I the super
intendent can keep an eye on him while he
works, and with a small case divided like
the regular working cases outside, and
something like two thousand cards bear-

and his credits are baled upon this and
the number of errors he makes. There
are men who can throw every card in its
place and at the rate of from fifty to six
ty-five a minute, which accounts. for the
fact that not more than one letter in six
thousand goes astray from this office.

Then comes a finer division, with direct
packages for all towns in California that
get more than fifty letters a day, while
those for smaller towns are routed for
their several trains and in the order in
which they are handled by the railway
postal clerks; for the more Important
cities of other States and for the dis
tributing postofQces of the Pacific foreign
countries.

office. The way this thing Is done is by
means of. directories. "Â¦ Uncle Sam has.
But Uncle Sam does not do business
that way. Again, he takes a paternal In
terest in giving quick service, and no stone
is left unturned to figure out the correct
destination - of the letter. -. \ :
These must be caught by the distribut
ing clerks as they throw the letters into
the cases. In case of insufficient address,
it Is easy enough, but a man has to be
thinking about what he is doing 1 to catch
mistakes. Where there Â¦ is a. mistake in
the a dress, If the sender's name is on the
envelope, j the ': letter could be returned to
him for correction; otherwise, it might

But postal clerks are not. the only peo

five hundred letters a day are, entered at
the . San Francisco, postofflce with insuf
ficient or incorrect address.

From the canceling machine the letters
go to clerks who make the first division
of them. Standing before : cases with
from a hundred to nearly two hundred
"pigeonholes, these men throw letters like
they were dealing out cards. In the first
general division the separation is made
for a few of the largest cities in the coun
try, States In groups, foreign mail that
goes by way of New York and San Fran-
By means of the canceling machine a
check Is put upon , all letters, showing
whether they have been dropped in mall
boxes or in the postoffice. This Is useful
in case of complaints from business men
who claim that their mall Is not handled
promptly. If, for instance, a man says
his mail is sent to the office by messen
ger, It can soon be learned whether the
boy took it there or. got tired and dropped
it In the nearest mall box. A letter "C"
on the canceling stamp marks the letters
collected from mall boxes, while a "D"
marks the drop letters mailed at the post
office.
And how the man who stands there
feeding them in must swear at the igno
rant and the silly who do not put their
stamps at the upper right hand corner!
Only stamps that are in the proper place
are canceled, and for the others the ma
chine must be stopped and the stamp
hand-canceled, for Uncle Sam is seriously
opposed to havipg stamps do double duty,
and there are people whose consciences
will let them cut uncanceled stamps from
letters and use them again.
Here the facers stand, straightening the
jumble into stacks all facing the same
way, for the next thing that happens to
the letters Is the canceling of stamps and
they must all be right side up with care
to run through the canceling machine,
which works at the rate of some unbe
lievable thousands an hour.
Their work begins on the long table wfth
its ever-changing, never-ending stream of
letters, dumped helter-skelter from bags
and baskets.
Working side by side with these busy
men, who are always running on schedule
time, are the men of the mailing division.
So much for the city . division, which
handles barely half the mall that passes
through the postoffice.
But, no, Uncle Sam is pleased to go to
more than two cents' worth of trouble to
find the owner of a letter. If It has no
street address a letter does not go at
once to the general delivery but to a cor
ner of the Battery-street postoffice
where, day after day, a corps of women
clerks pora over the city directory trying
to fit addresses to the names* on the en
velopes. The postoffice has Its directories
made to order. In eight sections, with
many blank pages after each printed
page, where the clerks note changes In
addresses and add new names; and before
letters without street and number are
consigned to general delivery they are
sent to addresses that may be found In
the directory under the same name, going
perhaps to several carriers before they are
given up as a bad. job and left to their
fate in the general delivery pile. **
All the attention these are entitled to is
to be put in a rack behind the general de
livery window In the main. office on Bat
tery street, held there until called for,
and if this does not happen within the
time specified on the envelope, returned

put his name on a corner of the envelope.
Or if there is no name and no instruc
tions as to time of return they could after
thirty days be sent to the dead letter of
fice.
Just plain San Francisco is all the clew
there is for about 20 per cent of all the
mail that comes In.
But the first division of the incoming
mail there is another class to deal with
besides that which goes, direct to the car
riers. This is the mail that has no street
address.
This all looks simple enough, because
the system has worn itself into such nice
grooves. It keeps on just the same day
after day until the hundreds of thousands
of letters heap into uncountable millions,
each year's volume increasing visibly.

at the edge of town, where the houses
are scattered and where the receipt of a
letter is an event, a carrier has much
ground to cover and makes but one or
two trips a day. Coming- farther in, where
business is done and letters are an every
day occurrence, the districts are smaller
and the trips more fro?vÂ«3t. In such
great buildings as the Mills and Parrott

â¢ase with many partitions he arranges his
â¢nail in the order In which he delivers it
â¢n his zigzag path.
Watch your carrier for a few days and
you will see that his route never varies.
XI it were not for the unlmpressionable
nffs of flagstones and paving things a
mail carrier would soon have his zigzag
path scrawled like a huge signature
across his district.
With the other malls It Is different.
It takes about twenty minutes to put
them through. There has been no
separation on the trains. When the
sacks are opened the letters are
distributed among clerks who sit be
hind cases divided according: to the
carrier districts. These clerks must know
the streets and numbers of San Francisco
as they know the alphabet, for each let
ter must be stuck in the pigeonhole that
stands for a certain district. When this
division is complete the letters are tied in
bundles and sent by the white mail cars
of the street car companies to the branch
offices and sub-stations, where the car
riers take them and arrange them in the
order of their route.
If It Is the overland mall It Is ready for
the carriers, &Â¦ all the letters for San
Francisco have been separated by a clerk,
who meets the west-bound train about 500
miles out of San Francisco. All"that re
mains to be done Is to distribute the bun
dles to the 250 carriers at the various
branch offices and sub-stations after the
letters have been back-stamped to show
date and time of receipt at the office, and
within ten minutes after the arrival of
this most Important mail the carriers are
handing it out to the people on their
routes.
When the railroad companies push their
trucks over to the postofflce door and
â¢tamp the bulging sacks on the floor, their
responsibility ends.

of bravery and endurance, of self-sacri

On these pages, therefore, the whole

The next important events occurred
when Washington assumed command uf

"Prisoners of Russia", Dr. Benjamin How
ard has given us a personal study of con

coming from the pen of bo eminent : an
author, will be found most. interesting.
What he has to tell us of the odd penal
colony on the Island of "Sakhalin, off the
mouth of the Amur. River, Is quite differ
ent from what others have had ; to say
with reference to political prisoners in
Siberia. Benjamin Howard,* M. A., M, D.,
F. R. C. S. E., was a penologlstof note.
He was born in England in 1836 and in 1853
came to America, where he worked at his
trade of painter and paper-hanger for a
livelihood while he attended college
classes.. His idea at that time was to be
come . a medical missionary and - he soon
gave promise of the eminence that he, was
to attajn later in life. He received many
honors and degrees in the medical col-;
leges.
He soon became intensely interested in
the question of slavery, and to investigate
for/ himself , the practical workings of.hu
man slavery even obtained employment as

American Medical Association, . entitled'
"The Direct Method of Artificial Respira

for him throughout the United States. .'He
held many responsible professorships dur-_
ing. his life; but was finally obliged to give
up all thls~ on account of his health and in
1875 left -New York for a prolonged stay in
Europe, Asia and Africa. :
i He was always very much : Interested ' in
the" djifferent* convict systems of the world
and /in the study of criminology and
prison reform; sp,; beginning with 1888, he
began to travel 'considerably: for the* pur-

the United States and through every con
vict: prison between St. Petersburg and
Siberia; in Russia he traveled many hun
* dred miles in hourly contact with more
than 500 exiles by road, river and rail. He
made practical studies of the Armenian

well, from a sermon to a sea fight or a
historical novel. ,' As an example of the
last we have "Hohenzollern," recently

No, nothing but the work that he\ has to

his natal year saw the commencement of
the "Great Famine" In Ireland.' At the
age'-.af; ten he had already begun to work
to add his scanty moiety to rent money,
wheti His. family was evicted from their
Â¦ holding- and forced to migrate from the
country. The Davitts.went to Lancashire,
where little Michael secured employment
in a cotton-mill. While "winding" a
ma.hine his arm was caught In the wheels
an-J torn j- off at the . shoulder. This ac
cident could hardly -be called a misfor
tune,- for it gave the sharp-witted boy
"three, years of hard study at Wesleyan
school, to. which he was sent by a Roman
Catholic/priest. He then obtained em
ployment in the local postoffice, where he
mustered the art of printing, and soon be
came an efficient "typo," perfecting his
education at night by constant attendance
at a mechanics' institute.
Davitt's father, an old follower of
O'Connell, was always an ardent Na
tionalist,: and before he was twenty Mi
chael found himself mixed upi in one of
; the revolutionary movements viiich he re
" garded at that time as the on'fy means of
righting his country's wrongs. He in
duced the other_jnembers of his family to
emigrate to America, and he became one
of the Fenian leaders In England. In 1S70
he was arrested, tried on a charge of trea
son-felony, convicted, and sentenced to
fifteen years* penal servitude. He con
tinued in prison for nearly eight years,
when he was released by the Government.
Davitt now set about organizing the
Land League, delivering lectures on the
subject. r in Boston, Philadelphia and Chi
cago. Returning home again in 1879, he
once more conferred with the Irish lead
ers, and, in the end, the Land League^ was
formally started. .-,: ". ;
The J Liberal party was then in power,
and though Mr. Gladstone, the Prime Min
ister,' was coerced by the Land League
movement to pass the great Irish land act
of 1881, 'the author of the agitation was
politically obnoxious to the authors of
the legislation for having forced their
hands. , Accordingly, in February, 188L
Sir William Harcourt caused him to be
arrested. It was during this imprison
ment that Mr. Davitt wrote his first book,
"Leavea From a Prison Diary-"
In the following year he went to prison
for the third time on his declining to be
bound. over to keep the peace. While a
prisoner he was elected to Parliament by
his present constituents as . a protest
against the treatment he had received,
' but he never took his seat.*
The upshot of Davitt's prison thoughts
was the conviction â¢ that revolutionary
methods were powerless to effect any use
ful object, and on this belief he has acted
consistently ever since.
Another result of his reflections as a
prisoner appeared when, subsequently, he
was elected to a seat In the House ' of
Commons, and took up the cause of prison
- reform. He had in the meantime, In the
course of wide travel, visited the leading
prisons In Australa and the United States.
His agitation was instrumental In I bring
ing about a marked change for tha better
in the treatment of prisoners in British
jails.
Mr. Davitt. as a result of his travels in
the antipodes, wrote a work entitled
"Life and Progress In Australasia."
He resignedi-hls s*eat in Parliament, a
few days after war was declared in Oct

conflict In South Africa. There he met
the leading Boer generals, and President
Stey n, whom hey greatly admires as the
wisest of statesmen and noblest of pa
triots.
Having such sources of information, the

More trouble awaits the unlucky De
Luynes In the' second chapter. It seems
that the Cardinal desires to marry Andrea
to Yvonne de Canaples, a rich heiress. The
brother, Eugene de Canaples, takes a dif
ferent view of the matter from his father
and Mazarin. and as the easiest way out
of the difficulty forces a quarrel on An
drea that he may kill him In a duel and
then have his sister wed the villain-of the
piece, the Marquis de St. Auban. So. In
the morning after Andrea's drunken spree,
De Luynes is paid a visit by Mazarin and
told that if this duel be fought, he, Gaston
de Luynes, will have the honor of hanging
for it To save his own neck the doughty
Gaston sallies forth and at once makes a
quarrel with Canaples and runs the gen
tleman through; but not content with this
he remains to remark that "there will be
no duel at St. Germain this evening" and
by eo doing lets his enemies know that he
has acted in the Cardinal's interest in sav
ing Andrea from Canaples' eword.
De Luynes tells the story in his own
words. At the beginning we find him a
lieutenant of the Cardinal's guards and
maltre d'armes to his Eminence's ne
phews, Andrea and Paolo de Mancini;
but the first chapter sees him stripped of
his honors and thrown out into the street
for allowing the young Andrea to so fill
himself with wine that Mazarin discovers
him seated on the floor in a drunken stup
or pulling the table load of crockery about
his ears and howling with glee.
Sabatini has that happy faculty, bo rare
in the authors of to-day, of making his
narrative first and letting the matter of
descriptions of people and places and thÂ«
atmosphere of his story take care of them
selves; he wastes no time In painting
stage settings, eo common a trait among
the writers of historical novels who think
they must sacrifice the Interest of their
story In order to give verity to the his
torical element. He gives you a vivid
mental picture of people and places by
suggestion and without wasting your time
in wading through chapters of descriptive
matter afraid to skip any lest you may
loee some thread of the plot.
ing made the motif of his story like that
of "Under the Red Robe." I merely men
tion these points of similarity that those
who enjoyed Mr. Weyman's tale may
know that here is another equally good.
"The Suitors of Yvonne" Is too well
written to criticize Mr. Sabatini for hav-
In fact, there is a marked similarity
between this romance by Sabatini and
that of Stanley Weyman. Weyman uses
Richelieu as the dread power pervading
the book, while Sabatini has Mazarin for
an omnipresent dangerâ both Lord Car
dinals and in the matter of disposition
and methods of intriguing one a close ap
proximation to the other. Jean de Berault
Is a gambler and professional duelist, a
6washbuckler, until the fire of love burns
out his wickedness and leaves behind a
noble man. Sabatlni's Gaston de Luynes
Is of the same stamp and goes through
the same refining process before he is
made true gold. Weyman's heroine is of
the haughty type who at first despises
the man she is later to love in spite of
-herself because of his generous deeds.
Yvonne is given every cause to dislike
Gaston de Luynes, but even her haughty
pride Is to fall in the end before the ad
miration that is unwillingly forced from
her for this man who does eo much with
out hope of reward and simply because
he takes pleasure In the doing.
Gaston de Luynes, the hero of the story,
is a man rich in birth but poor of purse.
His is a character suggestive of the fiery
D'Artagnan, but more nearly resembling
the hero that Stanley Weyman portrays
eo well in "Under the Red Robe"â Jean
de Berault.
This "Portion of the Memoirs of the
Sieur Gaston do Luynes" is quite remin
iscent of the good old days of "The Three
Guardsmen." There is a Lord Cardinal,
none other than the great Mazarin who
bo ably succeeded Richelieu In the relgh
of- Louis XIII and foreshadowed the
reign of Louis XIV. The time of the
story is laid when Mazarin is at the
height of his power and is trying to grind
en ax for himself by making a suitable
match for one of his Italian nephews, An
drea de Manclnl.

!s of everyday occurrence â a pale,
small woman to a snowdrop; a tall,
fair one to a Illy, or a blooming
maiden to a June rose.
The study of floral types Is fascinating.
"What flower does she resemble?" you
ask yourself, scanning each woman fair
as she passes by.
The rose maiden Is by no means an un
common type. She is queen of society, as
her floral sister is queen In the garden.
More or less beautiful, she is brilliant In
conversation, though often with a merely
superficial, knowledge, gleaned as she
skims along. Accomplished as a society
woman must be, she is happiest when the
center of attraction; kind hearted and
generous, but somewhat selfish* and un
willing to share the honors of her throne
with any other woman. . But be she fair
as the creamy tinted G-lolre de Dijon, as
dark as the darkest red rose, admiration
and excitement are to her as the very
breath of life.
And the Mb womanâ the sweet purple,
the light of the sapphire in it, is 'in her
eyes eyas that are sweet and swift and
bright. "1 could not see her face because
of her eyes." A pretty little conceit thatâ
once paid to an iris woman.
The prototype of a pend Illy is a beauti
ful soulless woman. Lovely, but unlov
ing, . her beauty lacks warmth and per
fume, as does the wax-like beauty of the
flower. Too cold to feel "green pleasure
or gray grief," tears and laughter are
alike unknown to her; calmly she glides
through life, untouched by joy or suffer
ing, and looking with cool disdain on the
' frailties and follies of her more passion
ful sisters. Admired by the other sex for
her beauty, her lifelessness freezes them,
her Indifference chills; lovely though she
undoubtedly be, she falls to inspire the
passion and life long adoration that follow
in the wake of the annunciation or Ma
donna lilyâ the prototype of all that is
rare among women. How many of the
fair sex can combine within themselves
the beauty, strength, nobility and, withal,
vx'iuislte sweetness of that lovely flower?
The flame oolored poppy is a somewhat
uncommon type of woman. Handsome,
with aÂ» kind of gorgeous coloring; Intel- ,
U-ctual and brilliant in conversation, en
f-rsetic, with wide opened, far seeing eyes
v. hen there is anything to be gained, yet
!nzy, with a languorous indolence that
savers of a tropical blood, as soon as the
need for exertion la past.

Morgan ln^Jsted upon bis resolution. Ho
wanted to knowâ and would knowâ
â¢whethf r or not thÂ© lobby that had been
hanging about Congress so thick that it
might 'be cut with a knife had been, re
ceiving or was to receive a part of the
$40,000,000 to bo paid for the Panama canal
property- Things of that kind, he said,
had occurred In diplomacy since the first
treaty was made. Large stipends . and
bribes trero paid to-day to men who con
ducted great "neirotlatlons. He desired to
SWARMS OP LOBBYISTS.
After Morgan had explained tho resolu
tion, Bpoonw of Wisconsin vigorously op
posed Its adoption, declaring that It was
without precedent, entirely mischievous
and obstructive of tho action of Congress.
Tho United States was In no position, ho
thought, to act as agent for bondholder*
or shareholders of the Panama Canal
Company. Those people Would have to
look to the French courts for their rights.
It was not the business of tho United
States to constitute Itself & guardian of
th* court and of tho people who had
claims against tho Panama Canal Com
pany.
WASHINGTON, Juno 28.-In
the Senate to-day the reso
lution offered yesterday by
Morgan, providing for an
Investigation by the Com
mittee on Interoceanie
Canals to ascertain whether any claims
Â«xlst In favor of citizens of the United
States Against the old or tho new Panama
Canal Company and authorizing the com
mittee to ascertain whether unlawful or
corrupt methods have been used to ob
tain aay part of thÂ© sum that may be ap
plied to the purchase of the property of
th* new Panama Canal Company or to
Costa Rica or Nicaragua by tho United
States, was taken up and argued.
Morgan disclaimed any effort, to
on 'the' Senate 1 or Congress' as a whole.
OPPOSED BY HANNA.
Hanna opposed the resolution, faying
that' tho people had accepted the verdict
of Congress upon the canal and were sat
isfied. Ho resented the intimation that a
lobby was hero to advocate the Panama
route and to induce Congressmen to vote
against their convictions and Inclina
tions. He protested against such an in
sinuation and declared that he never -had
known of such a lobby, and he challenged
Morgan to produce proof of his charge.
He was .'opposed , to the word and spirit
of the proposed resolution, .'and', in addi
tion to the cloud which- Morgan already
had thrown upon the title to the Panama
Canal Company's property, the endeavor
now was made to lay upon Congress the
charge of calumny and corruption. There
was no truth In the insinuation, and Mor
gan must have known there was , none.
He was unalterably opposed to .the reso
lution.. ". Â¦':Â¦''- 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦ :'<Â¦Â¦ .'â¢'
Mitchell of Oregon said he could not
see his way clear to support the pending
resolution because It would be' regarded
by the people as a means of delaying the
canal. He had been in favor of the.con
struction of the canal by the Nicaragua
route and he felt that Congress had made
a mistake in considering ' the Panama
route, but he was eo much in favor of an
Isthmian -unal and had so much confi
dence in the wisdom of the President, , to
whom the subject had been referred, that
lie could not bring himself to support the
resolution.
Epooner explained that the legislation
enacted would enable the- President to act
In the premises.- However, he (Spooner)
was not prepared to assent to the Sen
ate's assuming that the American credit
ors of the Panama Canal Company could
attack the decree of the French court in
this country, bo that ground might be
made for an' Indefinite obstruction of the
will of Congress In regard to an isthmian
canal. .' Â¦ Â¦ . â¢ â¢ â¢
be assured, that the United States had
â¢ sot been scandalized In any respect.
He insisted there had been a lobby here
in Â¦ support Â¦ of the Panama route, but he
had not charged that the lobby had cor
rupted Congress. He believed the carry
ing out of his resolution would clear the
atmosphere of all floating charges.
â¢ The resolution went to the calendar
without action. Â¦ . â¢ .
Speculation as to the Jeanle, since she>,
has not even been seen, is\ on the theory |
that she went farther west than any of
the vessels on the way up, and if she has
gone Into the straits at all it must have
been by, the west or Siberian channelâ
that is,, the west side of Dlomedes. The
chances for the escape of those aboard the
Jeanie would be still less than for the
Portland's passengers,
The crew of the Roanoke, arriving ye3
terday, saw but two Ice hummocks In all
the trip through Bering Sea, up and back,
That hundreds of miles of Ice could hava

almost Incredible and . indicates ttao

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 28.â President
Roosevelt's order to Attorney General
Knox to make an investieation of the
anthracite - coal eituation with a view of
learning whether an agreement exists
among the pperatPrs to regulate prices,
prevent competition and limit wages in
violation -of the Federal and trust laws,
was mtt by the presidents of the hard
coal roads, who were in this city to-day,
with a flat denial that any combination
exists. ,
That the coal operators are deeply an
gered and disgusted by the President's
order they do not attempt tp conceal, but
none of them would' venture/to make an
open criticism qf his course or to com
ment upon it in any way for quotation.
.Possible, interference from President
Roosevelt has been feared from the first
by | the operators. From a man who has
been closely identified with the operators'
side of the controversy from the begin
ning of the trouble the operators' attitude
toward the position taken by the Presi
dent was obtained to-day. ThÂ© operators
deny absolutely that there Is such a thing
as a coal trust or any combination of the
kind ' prohibited by the United States
laws. They insist . that all talk of such
a combination is nonsense. They declare
that they are perfectly willing to submit
tp any examination that the President or
his advisers may think proper, because
they are confident the Government would
find nothing on which to base hostile pro
ceedings.
While they do not object to an inquiry,
they regret that there should have been
any thought of such a thing at this time
because they fear it will encourage the
strikers to remain out longer than they
would do otherwise in the hope that the
President will do something to aid them.
They believe the strike leaders will make
the most of the President's order and that
it will be used to persuade the men that if
they will hold out only a little longer the
Government will weaken the operators
and give the strikers a victory.
â¢But whatever the President may do in
the matter, the operators say they are
confident he is powerless to injure them
and any action that may be instituted ky
the Attorney General will come to noth
ing. They were so confident of thi3 yes->
terday that they were almost defiant in
discussing the question.

HAVANA* June 28.â The arrest of Ama
deo-Raves and Isabelle Lacavallrie in
Havana harbor bids fair to cause inter
national complications Involving the
United States, France. Mexico and Cuba.
The persons arrested arrived at Havana
from Mexico, en route to New York.
Raves was charged with embezzlement
by, the father of Isabelle Laeavallrle, who
had. the Mexican authorities cable to the
Mexican. Consul here to arrest the couple
on their arrival, and stating the charges
against Raves. On receipt of the cable
the Mexican Consul advised - with the
French Charge d' Affaires and together
they presented the case to Senor Zaldo,
the Cuban Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
Secretary Zaldo decided it was possible
to hold the couple, and demanded of the
captain of the ship their delivery. Cap
tain Robertson protested and advised with
United States Minister Squires, asking the
latter to give orders for their delivery.
Minister Squires refused, declining to as
sume any responsibility in the matter.
Captain Robertson was forced to give up
the passengers, but registered a protest in
thfl United States legation, holding that
passengers In transit could not be taken
from a ship in an intermediate cbuntry
where no "violation of law was charged to
have been committed. :
Minister Squires is preparing a full re
port of the matter for the State Depart
ment. Raves promises a damage suit
against the Ward line for not fulfilling its
contract. He will also invoke the Govern
ment of France, of .which he is a citizen,
for protection.. Both of the prisoners be
long, to prominent and wealthy French
families . and eay their elopement was for
the purpose of marriage, and that the on
position of the girl's father was the cause
of the trouble. The man is 23 years old
and the girl is 16. They had been sweet-

WASHINGTON, June 28.-"When the

Columbia bill was adopted and it now goes
to the President for his signature.
The Plouse decided the- contested elec
tion case of Hprton vs. Butler from the
Twelfth Missouri District by declaring the
seat vacant. By a vote of 100 to 136â a
strict party voteâ Butler, who is a Demo
crat, was decided not entitled to the seat.
Butler made a vigorous speech of an hour
in defense of his right to the seat. The
Dick militia bill was made a continuing
order, not to interfere with conference re
ports.
McCleary of Minnesota called up the
conference report on the District of Co

mittee on . Naval Affairs, called up the
conference report on the naval bill. The
conferees, Fbss explained, .had agreed to
all {terns except those for the increase of
the navy and the place where the new
Bhips are to be built. Fitzergald of New
York Â¦criticised the conferees for yielding
to the Senate in- the* items, for the im
provement of the Portsmouth, N. H.,
navy .yard. , He thought the great navy
yards which were running on -half time
for. want of work 'should t>e built up and
the small yards abandoned. The report
was then adoptedâ 116 to 74. 'â¢
The conference report on the bjll to

adopted. ;A- resolution, was adopted to
grant the- Commissioner . from Porto Rico
the prilvege of the floor of the House.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY LIGHTS THE Will
The Establishment of the Electro-Chemic Institute in
San Francisco Means a New Era in Its Medical Life
THE ELECTRO-CHEMIC X=RAY
Is Celebrated in Eastern Cities for Its Cure of Can-
cer and Consumption, as Well as in the Diagnosis
of Intricate Chronic Diseases â Is Here to .Stan
'T'HE OPENTXG TO-DAY OF THE ELECTRO CHEMIC INSTITUTE AT 118 GRANT
* avenue, corner of Post etreet. with a competent corps of specialists trained by years of
experience In their specialties will mean much to sufferers from Chronic Diseases In San
Franc'sco. There have been many schools of medicine and many fads and fancies in its
practice, but never lias there been attempted such a great undertaking in the practice of
medicine as the opening of this Institute means.
The success of the Electro Chemic Institutes In other cities Cleans that it will be cor-
dially received In San Francisco. The rapid drift of practitioners of all schools to the basic
principles of advertising led the founders of the Electro Chemic ideas to openly come before
the public In the public prints. Their Institutions are founded upon the highest plane of
professional honor and have been backed financially by ample capital. Each Institution is
lavishly equipped with all the latest appliances known in electricity and chemistry. Physi-
cians are selected for their experience In special lines of disease and are given long training
In Electro Chemic ideas. The Electro Chemic Specialists are presented to the people of San
Francisco upon their merits and will prove themselves more than worthy of public patronage. Â¦
Electro Chemistry is a combination of all that is good in the Homeopathic, Allopathic
and Electro Therapeutic Schools of Medicine. Its founders were men grown old In the prac-
tice of these branches of medicine. The discovery of the Crookes tube and the bringing of
the X-Ray into the practice- of medicine because of its wonderful therapeutic value and Its
usefulness in the diagnosis of Intricate chronic diseases led to the combination now found
In the Electro Chemic X-Ray. The Electro Chemic X-Ray will not be found In use any-
where besides Its own institutions and is amply protected. The strongest proof of Its value
Is in Its proved cure of cancer and consumption, ample proof of which will be given at the -
Institute.
Handsome quarters have been provided at IIS Grant avenue, corner of Post street, for
the accommodation of the Institute. Spacious waiting-rooms, with . every comfort, have â¢
been arranged separately for the accommodation of ladies and gentlemen. Treatment rooms
are fitted in perfect taste and with every convenience, and the apparatus Is of the latest
design, giving its specialists everyÂ»facllity for the painless treatment and cure of chronic
diseases. There are never any operations at the Electro Chemic Institute. Electricity has
banished the knife forever in medical practice. Those who have not followed its develop-
ment in the practice of medicine are as far behind the times as those who do not know that
Â¦we have a telephone or a cable, or wireless telegraphy.
Electro Chemistry cures when operations fall. Electro Chemic methods cure when the
best physicians of other schools fall. If you are tired of drugging without relief, lf you
have asked advice from other physicians and have failed to receive relief or satisfaction as
to your disease, then the Electro Chemic Institute invites you to free consultation and
demonstration of the v.-orklngs of this wonderful factor^ â the Electro Chemic X-Ray. There
Is no hesitation here, there Is no doubt; the Electro Chemic X-Ray shining through and r
through clears all doubt away, as darkness gives way to the light of dawn.
The saving by giving office treatments and the hpuelng under one roof of a numbeV of
specialists, with lessened rents and special apparatus for treatment is given to the Insti-
tute's patrons. It will cost you less for treatment here than from any other specialist of
ability.
In order that all may Investigate and satisfy themselves as to the merits of the Electro
Chemic X-Ray, there will be given â¢ 1
DAILY FREE ELECTRO-CHEMIC X-RAY DEMONSTRATIONS
In the Interest of science and the public generally. An hour has been set aside, from 12:30
p. m. to 1 :30 p. m., to allow of there being given a lecture as to its workings in the diag-
nosis of disease and therapeutic qualities in the cure of cancer, tumors and consumption.
These lectures are interesting to every one whether they may be sick or not, and the public
Is cordially invited to attend.

convincing proof that the kidneys and blad-

What to Co.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy fulfills every
wish in curing rheumatism, pain in the
back, kidneys, liver, bladder and every part
of the urinary passage. It corrects inability .
to hold water and scalding pain in passing
it, or bad effects following use of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day, and to get-up many times
during the night. The mild and the extra-
ordinary effect of Swamp-Root is scon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures of the most distressing cases.
If you need a medicine you should have the
best. Sold by druggists in 50c. and$l. sizes.

OFF BAI/TIMOBE GROXHSTDS
Soon after the legal separation of Pro
fessor and Mrs. Driver the former mar
ried a Palo Alto young lady.
Mrs. Treadwell ls a strikingly pretty
woman. Her beauty captivated Professor
Driver when she was sent to San Jose to
complete her musical education under tha
professor. As a young girl she was famed
as one of Sonoraa's prettiest daughters,
and the last few years have only added
a charm and ripened beauty to girlish
prettlness.
Treadwell was in Petaluma much of
this time. He mingled but little with the
townspeople and made no secret of the
fact that he was here solely to see. hia
friend and former music teacher. They
departed from Petaluma together quietly,
and the news of the wedding was sup
pressed by Mrs. Driver's relatives until
the secret finally worked its way from
Ogden to Petaluma. Mr. and Mrs. Tread
v/ell .are now en route to Europe, to be
abroad for a year.
About a year ago Mrs. Driver came
home to her parents. Her child was al
ready here, and not long afterward her
second baby was born. Following quick
ly this event came the suit for divorce,
the grounds being willful' neglect and
failure to provide. Professor Driver did
not contest the suit and the decree was
granted In February.
Treadwell was taken to the Driver home
by the professor and Introduced as the
latter's best friend. Treadwell's marked
admiration for and - attention to Mrs.
Driver for the past two years caused
considerable comment in Petaluma. When
Mrs. Driver came home on long visits to
her parents It was seldom that the name
ot" James P. Treadwell wa3 not on the
Petaluma Hotel register. As Mrs. Driver
increased the length and frequency of
her visits 'home .and Treadwell continued
to board at the hotel reports gained cur
rency that all was not well with Pro
fessor Driver and his wife, and that
though Driver loved his wife madly he
did not provide her with the luxurious
surroundings and the pin money which
her ideas of comfort demanded. .-
PETALUMA, June 2S.â James P. Treaa
well, the young millionaire of San Jose,
was married at Ogden on Thursday to
Mrs. Abbie Montrose Driver, the divorced
wife of Professor Leon Driver of Santa
Clara and only daughter of Capitalist I*.
G. Nay of Petaluma. The -wedding was
the sequel to a romantic friendship ante
dating the divorce suit by a considerable
period, having commenced when Tread
well was taking music lessons from Pro
fessor Driver's pretty wife.

K. S. C. Medical Co. â Dear Sirs: It affords
me great pleasure to be able to express my
everlasting gratitude to you for the great bent-
fit received from the use of KEMP'S SUP-
POSITORIES. For years I suffered every tor-
ture. Was treated by five different physicians,
but only failed and grew worse. Discouraged.
I tried three remedies for female complaints
â¢without relief, and after having martyred al-
most everything, reluctantly submitted to an
operation which seemed to paralyze me par-
tially, as a result of which I waa confined
to my bed for three months. Almost on the
verge of despair I was induced to try KEMP'S
SUPPOSITORIES. I was naturally skeptical
about anything helping me. but after the first
month the change in my condition was mar-
velous. After nix months' use of the Suppoai-
tories I was pronounced cured, and for the- last
year have been enjoying perfect health. I gladly
tell this, and would cheerfully recommend tha
remeds to all suffering as I did. All who use
it according to directions will agree with me
that life ls not such a failure after all. Very
gratefully, ANNA M. CLANCY.

OROVILLE, June 28.â Fire is sweeping
the country southeast of this place. Two
houses, four barns, a great quantity of
hay, some growing grain and many miles
of fences have been destroyed. The fire
started shortly before noon at the Brasel
ton place, east of Orovllle, and was car
ried before a brisk north wind through
the dry grass and underbrush. It was
only by the hardest fighting that farmers
Eaved their homes from destruction and
in two cases the flames gained the vic
tory over them. Orange groves suffered
in some instances and In a path three
miles in width no dry grass is left.
The fire is now close to the Yuba County
line, and, as the wind has abated, it *is
hoped the fighters will gain control of the
Carnes.
It is reported here that a Government
Survey party under J. G. Hooper and D.
A. Jones, who have a contract to survey
ail the unsurveyed townships in the high
Sierras of that section, built a signal fire
last night about one mile from Pilot Peak,
a landmark near the summit, and later
covered it with dirt and returned to camp.
A heavy wind arose In the night, scat
tered the fire over the hillside and gave it
headway before the surveyors could reach
it. This report has not been verified.
The fire is in a heavily wooded section
and the destruction of timber will be very
great.

highly musical and scholarly fashion
much Bach, Handel, Mendelssohn, Liszt
and other classics for the harpâ that, by
the way, I cannot but think would be to

are also original compositions that

"The Crusader and the Saracen," and

almost as well as the harp, and lastly

The dirge we had heard from the hilltop

ily be recognized by any good son of the
Emerald Isle, and all given with a keen
sympathy, strong sense of dramatic value,
and ease that mark the best in ballad
singing. The harp numbers- included the
Bach B minor gavotte (from the second
violin sonata), that lends itself admirably
to harp possibilities, the "Msnuet Celebre '

There are many who will learn with
regret of the discontinuance of the organ
recitals of Mr. Louis H. Eaton of Trinity
Church. Tire recitals have become of late
a considerable feature of the church life,
and were attracting many outside admir
ers of the organist's art. Last week thtJ
last of these until the autumn was given,
with the usual good programme, and thÂ«
artistic assistance of Harry H. Barnhart.
In place of the recitals the organist will,
however, be heard In a short programme
after the Sunday afternoon services, as
used to be the worthy wont of the former
organist. Dr. H. J. Stewart. The first of
these- will be given this afternoon.

the pudding is in the eating. The play Is
only half the battle, and we shall see
what we shall see to-night at the Cali
fornia Theater. It is for^ that to decide
how grateful we may be for the revival.
Another novelty Jn . the . dramatic world
of the week will beâ to drop from the
sublime to Fischer'sâ the new bill at that
amazingly popular house. .â¢
All "Fiddle Dee Dee-dom" is stirred to
Its depths by the announcement of the
new programme to be given for the first
to-morrow evening. The bill will
contain two burlesques proper, of
the genuine ' Weber and Fields'
brand, and that will not lose point
through local - unfamiliarity with the
burlesqued. The first, "Antony and Cleo
patra," is the Weber and Fields' notion
of royal Egypt .and her - Roman, lover,
and the second. Captain Robert Mar
shall's "A Royal Family," that charming
Annie Russell v gave us last year; also ac
cording to the same hilarious authorities.
There is a third, "Pousse Cafe," whose
title sufilces. For those who like the kind
of thing, and it has been demonstrated
that they are many, the Fischer Theater
has a neat, smart, breezy performance to
offer â some good nonsense, Â¦ some fool
nonsense, but at any rate complete re
lief from thought for as many minutes as
it lasts.
ONE has been hearing much of
late of Francesca da Rimini;
of "Paolo and Francesca M ac
cording to Stephen Phillips as
given In London; of "Fran
cesca" according to Gabriele d'Annunzio
as given in Rome â with Eleanora Duse;
of the latest "Francesca da Rimini" ac
cording- to F. Marion Crawford, as given
In Paris by Bemhardt, and in our own
country of the version according to
Bcker as given by Otis Skinner. Modestly.
In the rear of the procession as usual,
comes San Francisco, with the Boker
version as edited by Lawrence Barrett, to
be given by Frederick Warde and his peo
ple at the California Theater to-night.
The production is the Otis Skinner one
that has recently met with such marked
favor In the East, and there should be a
ecEtiderable measure of success await
ing Mr. Warde's enterprise if the cast Is
at all equal to the play, and It promises
to be. ...
The character of Lanciotto It would not
surprise to find a peculiarly grateful one
to Mr. Warde, to whom naturally it falls.
The bitter cripple, "a thing by whose
comparison all Rimini holds itself beau
tiful," runs the whole gamut of human
pain and passion, and is a part to delight
the tragedian. It seems 'to me, remember
ing among other things the actor's King
Lear, that Lanciotto will come well
Â¦within Mr. Warde's powers, and If so,
half of this da Rimini is assured. His
brother and rival, the gallant Paolo,
gifted with all the graces Lanciotto
lacks, will be interpreted by Lawrence
Hanley, who played the same part oppo
site to Lawrence Barrett's Lanciotto.
Another powerful character fs that of the
Jester, Pepe, that will, two to one, be
â¢well taken care of by that clever actor,
Barry Johnstone, and Charles Herman
Â¦will have the part of Malatesta," also
without doubt to the benefit of the cast.
Judith Beroldo heads the feminine con
tingent of two, ft-ancesca of Rimini and
her nurse, Ritta. I have not yet the
pleasure of acquaintance with Miss
Bcroifie's work, but understand Bhe has
played the part Inâ vaguely, "Europe"â
â¢with success, and that she was for some
time leading lady with the elder Balvini.
Ritta Is to be assumed by Mr. Warde's
daughter. Miss May. The production
calls for and will have any number of
minor folk and picturesque costumes and
scenery.
Leas jrarely poetic than the Phillips
play, Boker"s %-ersion of the loves of
Paolo and Francesca is much more dra
matic, more "actablw," as those of the
craft say. Neither does It lack poetry,
many toe and pregnant lines telling the
immortal story- And the characteriza
tion Is sure and clean. If overcareful,
each portrait, with its lavish, detail,
etanfllng well out on the dark canvas.
The incident is picturesquely imagined,
and with the powerful climaxes of the
etory offers dramatic fare that 'is not
easily obtainable in these days of reg
nant comedy, and that should be com
inensurately valued. But the proof of
An idea of the vastness of the population in and around London maybe obtained from the
recently published statistics showing that there.are treated annually in the" hospitals ;of the city
about 1,967,000 patients; and it is to be borne in mind that the city is one of ttie healthiest in
the world. â¢ ,
SINCE the throngs of visitors who filled the city last summer are to be succeeded this year
by still larger throngs, it seems evident that San Francisco is destined to become the
most popular summer convention city in the Union. It is therefore -worth while to take
' note of the rapidity with which improvements are going on in every direction and the in
creasing attractions offered to visitors. â¢
From the business center to the suburbs in every quarter there. is something like a-build
ing^oom under way. One can hardly walk along any important street { for half a dozen blocks
without finding the sidewalk obstructed by material for the erection of a new structure of some
kind. Hotels, theaters, office buildings, stores, shops, homes and apartment houses are risino- all
round us. Facilities for housing_ and entertaining our guests, are going to be much greater within
another year than they are to-day. When those who have heard San Francisco described by the
visiting Mystic Shriners, who have just left us, come next summer to see foi\themselves they will
find a more magnificent city than they expected. ; '
At present the improvements are being made almost wholly by private enterprise. The
'city itself beyond the steady, development of the park is doing comparatively .little. In the end,
however, the. sentiment which now moves private enterprise to the work of improvement will affect
the whole community, and San Francisco will enter upon the task of adorning herself as a
municipality. The mo.re beautiful and the more commodious are. the homes, the offices and the
theaters of the people, the more eager will they become for municipal surroundings equally at
tractive. Where there are stately and noble structures, there must be good, well-paved and
cleanly kept streets, and where such streeets are maintained 'there must in the end be ampler parks/
avenues, boulevards, gymnasiums and baths. . Â¦ . .
i The era of private improvement thus gives promise of an era of . municipal improvement
that is sure, to come. Our climate and other natural advantages already give us pre-eminence
as a city of attraction to tourists, conventions. and holiday; seekers. In: the future we shall have
artificial attractions not less notable. They are bound to come. HKB

ON a good Sunday some two or
three weeks ago I was wan
dering In company with friends
over the foothills that stretch
their suave, brown lengths
behind Oakland. The day was per
fect; the sceneâ hills of. fine gold
in the foreground, a Jeweled city
shining beyond, and in the distance
dreaming Tamalpais, lifting her stately
breast to a rapturous azure skyâ was In
deed well enough. â¢ However, this is not
a climatic ecstacy, and the gently curv
ing hills, Oakland posing as an Aladdin's
valley and Tamalpais in every tone and
temper of her beauty are probably fa
miliar to you as to me. They figure here
merely as the highly, effective setting of
a little pastoral symphony I came In for
on this particular day.
We first became startllngly aware of it
during one of those little, sudden rifts
that occur in conversation, aware of a
strange, new graciousness added to the
landscape, of a vivid flush of human
beauty that transformed the scene into
its simple setting. Stealing up from the
heart of a little canyon below came the
. soft wail of a woman's voice, crooning,
to a few wild and mournful chords, the
plaintive measure, of some ancient dirge.
With exquisite fitness the unknown min
strel was accompanied by a harp, played
evidently by mysterious artist hands. The
voice, also, was that of a cultivated
singer, and sympathetic in highest de
gree; the song, as we listened silently,
heard to be in some soft, foreign tongue
.to which none of us held the key. Who,
or what, could . be the invisible musician
or musicians? Some wandering Mignon
arid Lothario? Some sweet old ghosts of
dark centuries gone? Some modern ban
shee wailing the coming death of an ex
ile from Erin?â for anything, everything
seemed possible amid such surroundings.
.. Of course, it wasn't anything of the
kind, yet the romance of the story still
held neatly together when we discovered
its solution. It seemed that this was to
be the surprise of the day's programme,
these wild notes the foretaste of a pleas
ure to come later. The. singer was lime.
Inez Carusl, the harpist also lime. Carusi,
whom the Tivoleans learned to admire Ia3t
year, and whom Anton Seidl 1 of revered
memory held to be, the first harpist in
America. A friend of some one of us,
who had learned of her woodland retreat,
the harpist-singer had graciously con
sented to adorn the day with her songs.'
Accordingly, later, we made our way to
the embowered' cottage where Carusi
Mrs. Albrecht' In private " Ilfe-4ia3 "en
sconced herself for the summer. . Thero
we were hospitably treated to a pro
gramme that- was a genuine delight tri a
scene that enhanced the pleasure a hun
dred fold, with â¢ vita ' roses, overarching
trees and shaded- veranda, where sat the
musician with her beautiful- instrument.
Mme. Carusi is that kind of harpist that
the butcher of the ferryboats labors so
strenuously to efface the belief In. She is
an artist, the best we have had here to
my knowledge.- Her musical history read3
brilliantly. She was long with Anton
Seidl in the Philharmonic Orchestra of
New York as solo harpist. She played in
a series of forty concerts with the Ga
briel of the pianoforte, Paderewski. She
was with Damrosch in tha Symphony Or
chestra of New York, with Grau also at
the Metropolitan Opera-house, with that
delightful danseur of the conductor's
stand, "Eddy" Strauss, and many others
of lesser fame. ' > . .
Further, Inevitably dissatisfied with the
REPORTS from Washington that President Roosevelt intends to signalize the passage of
the Philippine civil government bill by a proclamation of amnesty to political prisoners
in the islands have been read with gratification by all who desire the establishment- of
Â¦.-,-â¢ genuine peace between ourselves arid the Filipinos. War and harsh, measures. can "make
a desert and call it peace," but peace itself can be brought to any part of the earth' only by the
exercise of justice and liberality.
Doubtless the administration has good reason for making the grant of amnesty dependent
upon the passage of the Philippine bill, and yet there would have been a fuller satisfaction were
it known the grant would be made whether the bill passed or not. The publication of amnesty at
Manila on July Fourth would make so notable and pleasing a feature of the celebration of the day
in that part of the world that no chances should be taken of missing it. Moreover as we are strong
enough to treat the Filipinos with more leniency than Spain could afford to do, our greater power
imposes upon us a greater responsibility, and we can well afford to be liberal and merciful to a
weak foe without haggling about terms..
Fortunately there is little or no occasion for fear of the defeat. of the civil government bill.
Washington authorities are agreed it will be passed in time for the proclamation -to be made on
Independence Day. Along with the proclamation will go another declaring the existence of peace
in the islands. Military rule will give place to civil government throughout the archipelago ex
cept in those localities where the population continues to be dangerously hostile to American
occupation. That means the islands are about to enter upon a new phase in their history and the
people are to have the opportunity of a new development.
It is not worth while to speculate as to what results will follow. Japan affords a proof
that oriental races can adapt themselves to the new civilization which the nations of the, Occident
are spreading over the world, while India stands as a warning .that some oriental races are not
changed by the contact of western civilization. Whether the Philippines are to continue stagnant
Jike India or progress like Japan is too complex a problem to be solved at this time. Two
things are clearâ Japan has made progress while retaining independence; India has not accepted
progress though forced upon her by conquest. From those facts it seems reasonable to conclude
that if we are to promote civilization among the Filipinos the less we rely upon the sword the
better it will be. AmnesTy is not only a matter. of liberality, but of policy. It is gratifying to
know it is to be proclaimed. . *
-AJUCISTESTY I3ST THE FKCIUjIFFIJSTES.
ONCE more the popular and familiar misreading of Shakespeare's line," "One touch of
nature makes the whole world kin," finds an. illustration of its truth. Shakes
peare did not mean that sympathy with the sorrow of another is the touch that makes
: the kinship of the world, but the universality of the sympathy among civilized men
with the British people as they wait and watch for bulletins from the bedside of their suffering
King proves that after all that is the true bond of kinship. Nothing else draws men ,so near to
gether or manifests so keenly the essential unity of human nature. ' â¢
Had Edward gone to his coronation radiant in health and strong in the pride of his power
and station to receive the symbols of his sovereignty over the greatest empire the world has
known, he would not have had anything like the universal good will that is given to him in the
suffering and danger that have befallen him. Had* this been for him a week of triumph and
splendor there would have been voices of criticism all round him, and the very congratulations
sent to his throne would have been formal, conventional and in many, cases insincere. Now all
criticism is hushed. There is no insincerity in the "messages that are carried to his sick room, no
coldness in the feelings of the hearts of those who in every part of the globe wait to hear the latest
bulletins from his physicians, longing for good news. "*
The feeling of widespread sorrow is not due wholly to the fact that the sufferer is a King
and an Emperor; and that a mighty nation is mourning in the dread that its sovereign may be
summoned to death almost at the very hour that was fixed for his coronation. Much has been
awakened by the personal character of . Edward himself. From the beginning of his career he
has been noted for the geniality and all comprehending sympathy of his disposition. Few men who
have lived conspicuously in the public eye have had such a ready willingness to fraternize with
almost every, kind and class of men. Edward has been esteemed by statesmen and scholars,
among whom are some of his sincerest friends, and at the same time he. has been popular with the
masses. He has delighted to share in all the sports/games and amusements of his people. The
literary men of London have ever counted him as one of the most genial guests welcomed at the
receptions of the Savage Club. To foreigners of. distinction he has been the most cordialhost in
England. His welcome has been liberal in every meaning of the word, and men of every country
have shared in it. ',-Â¦-Â¦':.
A man of such varied sympathies could not fail in any walk of life to have a large following
of warm personal friendships, and Edward, by reason of his. high station, has attracted perhaps a
larger circle of such friends than any other man of our time. In almost every city of note in the
world there is some man or woman who has met him and liked him. These people are now bear
ing, their testimony to his worth and sorrowing in his illness. With their feeling mingles
that of the masses â the common human sympathy going out to any one. who lies at the dread
portal of death.
In the crisis in which the King lies the scales of life and death are so evenly balanced
that the physicians who attend him dare not speak with assurance of' his recovery. Of late the
bulletins have been encouraging to the hopes of his people. Americans can readily recall how but
a short time ago they passed through a like- period of suspense while President McKinley strug
gled for life, and they can therefore more keenly than any other people sympathize with the
British in this juncture. Reports from other countries, however, show that all nations share the
sympathy. From every part of the globe prayers, heartfelt and solemn,, will arise to-day for the
health of Edward' that he may live to enjoy for many years a happy and beneficial reign over a
prosperous empire.

a length over Hurstbourne, which was
one-half a length in front of Golden
Maxim. After the field came thundering
along Mizzen had increased his lead to a
length and a half. The other, positions
were about the same. As the horses made
the bend at the head of the stretch Miz

dropping back with every stride.
At the furlong pole from the stretch
Irish Lad began to close, coming from

McFad'dcn is the only man who can
solve the mystery of his bad showing.
His trainers are as much in the dark
as N are Â¦ the . spectators as to McFadden's
utter collapse.
The match with Gans was never to Mc-
Fadden's liking. He came West to. fight
Britt, who had just left the amateur
ranks. Between tlie time McFadden left
the East and his arrival here this match
had fallen through and Gans had been
substituted -for Br!tt. McFadden was
furious when he found the turn affairs
had taken. He knew Al Herford's
colored' champion was his master and
wanted none of his gamo.
McFadden was finally prevailed upon to
sign to meet Gans. He went through his
training in a perfunctory manner, with
out ambition or Interest, his heart not be
ing in his work. When he entered the
rirg he seemed dull and listless. He was
like a man in a trance. After tlie fight had
gone one round Referee Wand wanted to
stop it, but McFadden's seconds told him
to Jet it. continue. .......
For an hour after the fight McFadden
could hardly speak. He had to be shaken
roughly to get a word out of him. In
the language of the street,- he -is "all in."
' The management' of the : Hayes Valley
Athletic -Club made a grandstand play
yesterday; refusing to pay the fighters
their share until it waa clearly shown
the fight was not a fake. As they laid
the foundation for the fiasco by making
so bad a match, they cannot .consistently
1 ptmlsh Gans, who came here from the
East and caried out his part of the con
tract to the- letter. ......
Al Herford deposited $1000 yesterday
and agreed to forfeit this amount, to
gether with' his share of the purse, if any
proof was forthcoming that there was any
collusion between the fighters.
The total gate receipts were only $3200.
Of this amount the lighters' share was
$1600. This was divided, . 60 per cent to
the winner and 40 to the loser.
There is not the slightest possibility of
the fight being a "fake" in the sense of
being prearranged. It was simply an un
fortunate match, which looked well on
paper, only to prove a fizzle when the
men faced one another in the ring.

SACRAMENTO, June 28.â Playing su
perb ball at all stages of the game, ma
terially aided by the errors of their oppo
nents, coupled with timely hitting when
hits were most needed, won again for the
Ponies in one of the hardest sticking
games of the season. When Doyle came
to the bat for the first time he landed
hard on the ball, sending it against the
back fence for a home run. Casey, who
folJowed him to the bat, sent a home run
to the" same locality. Manager Fisher has
protested all the games of this week's
series on the ground that Harris is play

OAKLAND.
On several occasions both teams came
within an ace of making- runs, but' some
thing always happened. Oakland was
continually in the game and liable to
shove a man to the finish at any moment.
The eighth and ninfh were the most
dangerous moments for tHe Angels. In
the eighth Jones gave his first base on
balls to Schmidt, who was forced at sec
end by Mohler. Mohler stole second and
then third, while Lohman took a pass.
Gorton had already been put out and it
was all up to Streib, who ended the finÂ©
chance by flying out to Householder.
The ninth capped the climax of the ex
citement. McCreedie flew out to first.
Devereaux singled to left. Dunleavy hit
a fly to the farther corner of center,
which Householder smothered by a great
run. Francks singled over "second, and it
locked like at least one run. Gorton, how
ever, was" not equal to the emergency and
hit an easy one to Jones, who threw to
Hanlon, and the Oakland pipe went out'.
The light hitting did not affect the bat
ling average of McCreedie, who hit out
two singles out of four times at bat.
Toman made the only Angel mistake by
throwing Schmidt's easy grounder over
Hanlon's head in the sixth. After the
first Oakland's error column was immacu
late. The score;
The first round produced the lone run
of the day. Toman started the fracas by
striking out. Jackson laid down a pretty
bunt and beat the throw to first. House
holder lined a hot drive at Mohler, who
failed to hold the ball and Jackson landed
on second. . He got mixed up between sec
ond and third and finally reached the last
station* on'Lohman's bad throw. Reilly
walked, filling the bases. Raymer shot
a single over second, which put Jackson
over the route with the only run. House
holder was caught at the plate on Gor
ton's accurate throw."
Reilly*s turn came last and he had the
talisman.- It was a wonder and it de
livered the goods. Reilly | told them tc
watch him, and so he arrived at the
grGÂ»ynds : with the luxurious bunch
chopped' off the high end of his speaking
tube. The team marveled and said kind
things to Reilly for his wise thought,.
Everything went the way of the south
erners ana they won out 1 to 0, so Reilly
has at last hit upon the plan to make the
jLos Augeles team win. Hq was the only
man lii the league to sport hair on ' his
face, and now tnat it is gone the Angels
&ay the pennant is theirs.
It was a great game. Schmidt and
Jones again threw against each other, and
this time Schmidt ran second. Both men
showed great control and cleverness and
kept the gray matter in their thinking
machines working to the limit. Schmidt
was hit harder than his opponent, but
managed to keep the hits scattered. Al
though allowing nine safe singles, only
one lone run resulted.
Jones kept shoving them over the mid
dle of the rubber, but had a mysterious
something which the leaders never could
get real wise to. Until the seventh inning
McCreedie's single was the total amount
of Oakland's batting. In the seventh it
looked ripe for an Oakland run, but Jones
retired the side with two singles.
The Angel tossera were up against the
crisis yesterday in their wanderings. It
began to look bad for them. They had
reported' to many grafts, such as the old
time horseshdV dodge, the proverbial rab
bit's foot hunch and several others which
uteered them wrong. iSvery man was
called upon to float a new one which
would win the game, arid they all passed
it up but Reilly.

An itcliing, burning skin disease during tne hot, sultry summer weather, is a positive
terror and a veritable demon of discomfort. The intolerable itching and stinging are tanta-
lizing almost beyond endurance, and the unsightly eruption and rough, red skin keep one
thoroughly uncomfortable and miserable night and day. Eczema, Tetter, and diseases of
this type are caused by acid poisons in the blood, which the heat of summer seems to warm
into life and renewed activity. - These fiery acids keep the blood in a riotous and sour
condition, and the skin unhealthy and feverish â they inflame the pores and retard perspira-

question whether the packers are in a

this point the court overruled the motion
and appointed I. H. Kmley of Kansas

the packers, filed exceptions and objec

Changes Made in the Postal Depart-
WASHINGTON, June 28. -In the Senate
to-day Teller of Colorado presented a pe
tition from Estes G. Rathbone, praying
for a full investigation into his perform
ance of duties as Director of Posts of
Cuba during the occupation of the island.
Rathbone maintained in his petition
that he was unjustly tried and unfairly
convicted, and that he is entitled to a
full, fair and impartial investigation by
Congress. Teller said the petition was un
usual and the conditions ' were unusual,
and at his request the petition was read
in full. The petitioner asked that full jus
tice be done to the end that aspersions
upon his character might be eliminated.
Teller said the petitioner was not now
in jeopardy, but would have been had not
a general amnesty been granted by the
Cuban Government. He stood before the
world as a convicted criminal. The case
was unique, but it was one which might
arise at any time in the Philippines. It
seemed to him that the question demand
ed investigation by the Senate. While he
did .not pass on the guilt or innocence of
the petitioner, he believed there was a
fair presumption of his innocence.
The petition was referred to the Com
mittee on Relations with Cuba.
The postage stamp is one of the stamps
of civilization.
The recorder replied that it was a mat
ter of routine and the report showed that
Major Gardener had always been given
every advantage. He had long felt and
he believed this feeling was that of the
rest of the board that, regardless what
they did. Major Gardener would accuse
the board of unfairness. For this reason
the board had given the major every lati
tude. Every privilege to "throw mud"
was certainly not granted to the officers
and soldiers the major was endeavoring
to besmirch. The major had been repre
sented at the hearing as' Governor of
Tay.ibas by the Chief Supervisors, the
Fiscal's assistant, the Attorney General Â¦
and his first assistant. The -recorder did
not profess to be a lawyer. He thought,
however, that such an array of talent was
not likely to be imposed upon.
MANILA, June 2S.â At to-day's session
of the board which is inquiring into the
charges of cruelty, etc., brought by Major
Cornelius Gardener, Governor of the pro
vince of Tayabas, against American of
ficers and soldiers, Major Gardener con
tinued his testimony, the first part of
which was presented yesterday. Counsel
for Major Gardener said he thought the
grave question involved called for more
than ordinary inquiry.
It has been generally understood that
Genaral Smith was acquitted by the court,
but it traneyired to-day that such was
not the case, the court, it is alleged, hav
ing found General Smith guilty of violat
ing the rules of war and sentenced him to
be reprimanded bv the reviewing author
ity, which in this case is President Roose
velt. Inasmuch as the case is considered
strictly confidential until finally acted
upon by the President, it is impossible
to obtain any official information in re
gard to it.
WASHINGTON. June 28.â It is an
nounced by the War Department that the
case of General J. H. Smith will not be
acted upon finally before the end of next
week at the earliest. Judge Advocate Gen
eral Davis has completed his review of
the proceedings of the court-martial and
the papers are now in the hands of Secre
tary Root, who is so busy with other mat
ters that he has not yet had time to give
the question the attention it deserves.

"Weakness" I
That condition commonly known as. Â»|
hJ "V-eakness" is in reality one of the fci
; most simDle of men's ailments, and H
3 one that yields promptly and complete- n
ly to correct treatment. For genera- M
tions past physicians have been hand- fa
I Ing- down a moss-grown theory to the H
J effect that prematureness, loss of H
power, etc.. are* due to nervous de- H
! t rangement brought on through excess- Ej
E es, and to this day the treatment com- Â¦
P menly employed by most physicians and H
I specialists is a nerve stimulating, one H
e that excites the organs to temporary H
i Â£ activity, but which In the end cannot B
I g fall to aggravate the real disorder. H
i El "Weakness" Is nothing more than a H
H symptom resulting from a tender, swol- H
M len and inflamed condition of the pros- ffl
m tate gland. This prostatic disorder is H
IJ most frequently due to early dissipa- IB
H tion or to Injury caused by some con- K
Esj tracted disease. My treatment Is a I
(3 local one entirely, no stimulants or M
I tonics being employed, and is in every E$
instance promptly effective In restor- K
ing the prostate gland to Its normal B
state. As . this Is accomplished full n
â¢ and complete strength and vigor return. H
Such a cure is absolute and permanent, H
and by no other method can a like cure B
be effected. ia
Contracted Disorders I
H Every case of contracted disorders I |
treat is thoroughly cured. My patients H
have no relapses. When I pronounce a H
case cured there Is not a particle of in- B
j fectlon or inflammation remaining, and tft
there- is not the slightest danger that H
the disease will return in Its original H
form or work Its way Into the general M
system. No contracted disorder Is so H
trivial as to warrant Uncertain methods B
of treatment, and I especially solicit H
those cases that other doctors have H
been unable to cure, , H
! Varicoczle. . 1
This most prevalent of all diseases of H
men is also the most neglected, either M
i through dread of the harsh methods of H
j treatment commonly employed, or H
through Ignorance of the grave dangers t
that accompany the disease. As varl- H
cocele Interferes directly with thÂ« clr- H
Â« culation and process of waste and re- H.
; h pair throughout the organs, the neces- H
Isity of a prompt and thorough cure If
cannot be too forcibly emphasized. - I fa
cure varlcocele In one week, by an ab- Ej
solutely painless process. My cures are N
thorough and absolutely permanent and g|
are accomplished without the use of B
knife, Herature or caustic H

> -^ With -"j this Admiral' Dewey" -was. : dis
charged as a witness, and he . expressed
himself; as much gratified to secure his
release. \ Â¦
"Yes," i replied the witness, "that is
true, and it is a good idea. I had not
thought of it; and I am glad you. asked
it. It makes my. testimony stronger. It
is true, and the fact that I. did notiac
cept . the surrender and put them in
oharge shows that -I did not trust, them-
It never enteredmy head to do> that.' '.Â¦"Â¦<;
. Senator Dietrich's questions were in
tended- to show the state of Admiral
Dewey's mind concerning, the Filipinos at"
the time of the engagement with ; the
Spanish squadron. He asked the admiral,
if it was not true, if he had recognized
the Filipinos as: allies, trusted them aa
such and considered them capable of tak
ing charge of Manila, he would have ac
cepted the proffer of the surrender of
Manilas before the arrival of the 'Ameri
can-troops..-. * Â¦ : -..â¢-.-Â¦ '. :.J^V Â¦
Admiral Deweyâ Yea. True, I ; made Â»i
comparison once. with the Cubans, saying
tho Filipinos were more capabla of self
government than the .Cubans. .1 think
that neither the Filipinos nor the Cubans
are capable of self-government. '
r The chair assured the witness that he
need^notanswer. The admiral said, how
ever, in reply to further pressing,- that his
views did not coincide with those v ex
pressed by General Anderson "in a maga
zine article. ' ' ' â¢Â¦ ;'-Â¦'-.>Â¦Â¦
'-'They do not coincide," he said. ."We
differed very much from the beginning.", [t
Senator; Beveritige read extracts from
the reports of the first , Philippine Com
mission, of which Admiral Dewey was a
member, in which the statement was
made that the .Filipinos were incapable
pf standing alone, and. if the American
support was withdrawn they would lapse
into anarchy, and asked him if that had
been his opinion. .'Her replied in the af
firmative, adding that he still Â¦ retained
that â¢: view. . \ . . * .< ..
Senator Carmackâ Was that- always
your opinion? - Â¦
VI am here to testify to what! know,
and I will give all the information I can
in that way, but I am not rosponslbls
for what others have said. I do notklike
your questions and I do not think I ought
to be required. to reply to them."
PATTERSON. REBUKED.
He added that he was not conversant
with all of General Anderson's acts be
fore the. arrival of General Merritt, as
the general had gone his own way, while
he (Dewey) had gone his. He also* said
General Anderson had offended Aguinaldo
on the occasion of their visit by his ques
tions. When Senator Patterson pressed
other questions calling for reference to
statements made by army officers - arid
others ' the admiral declined to answer,
saying: f . . Â¦â¢ Â¦ Â¦
- "When I heard that he was writing let
ters to Aguinaldo I advised him against
(Joins so." ' â¢ Â¦ i
Senator - Patterson asked a number of
questions concerning Admiral Dewey's as
sociation with General Anderson after his
arrival ,and his visit to Aguinaldo in com
pany with the general. He said 'he had
suggested to General Anderson on the oc
casion of that visit that he need not wear
his uniform or put on his sword, but that
his blouse would be sufficient. Â¦ and that
the suggestion had been adopted. Re
ferring to a report of that interview made
by General Anderson and to copies of let
ters written by the general, in which
Aguinaldo was assured of a desire for
amicable relations, Admiral Dewey said
that he. did not remember that any such
assurance had been given.. . Speaking of
General Anderson's letters to the Philip
pine chieftain, the witness said:
ADVICE FOB AiNDERSON.
â¢ "You do know," Patterson went on,
"that there were several who got good,
fat offices?" The reply was in the nega
tive. The witness also said he knew
nothing of the payment of money to the
Cuban General Gomez, and he added the
suggestion to Senator Patterson -that he
should not put such questions to himi^
self rich at the. expense of the American
Government if he had given up?"
Tho admiral hesitated and said he could
not answer the question. He was told by
the chair that he need not do so.
"I do not, know," was the reply. "I
have not been in the Philippines for three
years; how should I know?"
"Do you not know from your experience
that there was never a day while he was
in arms that ho could not have made him-
Here the admiral again referred to
Aguinaldo's style at Malolos, and Senator
Patterson asked if that style had not
served the purpose of inspiring the ad
miration of his followers and holding
their allegiance. . To this inquiry the wit
ness replied that the'style was "probably
more inspiring to them than to those
from whom the property had been taken."
"Do you think that is proper testi
mony?" asked Patterson.
- Chairman Beveridge interfered with a
strong protest against innuendoes against
Admiral Dewey. He considered the ques
tion &s discourteous. Patterson, however,
disclaimed any intention to be otherwise
than respectful, and , he continued hia
questions. Â¦ - ; : .,
"Do you' know," he asked, "whether
Aguinaldo has a dollar to-day?". -
"I was pretty sure as to whore he had
got the dollars, as he had not , brought
them with him," said the admiral, "and
I thought that- the fact that he wanted
gold was a pretty good indication that he
was getting ready to leave. That was
what made -me think that the man was
feathering his own nest, but it was only
a suspicion." - â¢ Â¦ .
FEAR OF TEEACHEK.Y.
This question the admiral declined to
answer, and Senator Patterson took the
witness, asking if Aguinaldo had ever
talked to him on the basis of selling out
to the Americans. The admiral replied in
the negative, and Patterson then asked
if the Philippine leader had ever asked
him for money. The reply was that
Aguinaldo had asked him to exchango
gold for Mexican dollars.
"Then you placed tho country at the
mercy of a man who would plunder and
rob, notwithstanding you had no need for
his services?"

of Gilroy. father or Martha May Ladd. the 12

Senator Carmackâ Then is that a fact
that you took a man lo Manila to be a
leader of the nartlve, people who had but
recently betrayed those people for a
bribe? , .Â¦ Â¦
Admiral Deweyâ I' think' that would
have made no difference; the country was
under a reign of terror. ' l
"Then you wanted a man who could or
ganize the natives?" Â¦ .
"No; I=did not want any one. Aguinaldo
and his people were forced upon me by
Consul Pratt and others." .
"Did the Consul and others have any
power to force these people upon you?"
"Yes, by constant pressure.-. I did not
want the Filipino refugees, because I did
not believe that a half-dozen of them
would do anything good in view of the
A number of questions were asked in
regard to statements by Generals Greene,
Bell and others, but the witness asked to
be excused from criticizing the army and
the chair (Senator Beverldge) said he
was not required to answer - any
questions the replies to which would
involve such criticism. Thereupon the
admiral said he was "very glad," and
Senator Carmack said he knew -of no
such rule, but he supposed he would have
to submit. The admiral added that no
opinion by others. would change his of
ficial opinion of Aguinaldo. Â¦
NO ARMY CRITICISM.
Pattersonâ Do you refer to Aguinaldo
taking property for the support. of the
army as loot and pillage?
Admiral Deweyâ That is one part of it
Senator Carmackâ You did not object at
that time? -
Admiral Deweyâ No, but he soon got be
yond me.
"Well, "we did not do that way. For in
stance, I "took all the coal in sight, but I
paid for it."
Continuing his reply to this question,
the admiral said the Philippine army was
then only a mob and without organization
and had to be fed and clothed.
"Ho did as many have doneâ he* made
the country* support him."
"Did you regard that proceeding as
pillage and loot?"
"No, that is war, as you know."
Replying to another question, the ad-'
miral said it was the general t rep'ortl
throughout the East that in 1897- Agui-l
naldq had betrayed his people to -the
Spaniards for money. He did not remem
ber that this report had been denied by
American officers in the Philippines.
Among other officers quoted In this con
nection was General Greene, and tho ad
miral called attention to the fact that
General Greene had not given his" au
thority. Â¦ , J* jVAUj Â¦; |
"If," he said, "Agoncillo told 'him, Â»i
don't think the authority was good."
"Why do you say that Aguinaldo took
the lion's share of the property gathered
by- ihe insurgents?" ~ Â¦
" "Because he "was living at Malolos like*
Â«. prince. He had nothing when he' land
ed in Manila and could have procured
the means for this ostentation in: no other,
way. He began immediately after arrival
to take every dollar in sight. It may be
ungrateful in me to state the fact, but it
Is true that he sent cattle to meâ herds of
themâ for the ships. The stock was taken
from the Philippine people."
"Was any statement made of this cir
cumstance at the time?"
PRINCE-LIKE AGUINALDO.
"I think you are making too much of
Aguinaldo. He was a mere figurehead
and was surrounded by . . stronger men
than himself. Mabini was one of these
and General Luna, whom he had* killed,
was another."
In reply to other questions put by Sen
ator Carmack concerning Aguinaldo, the
admiral said:
"I won't say that," the admiral replied,
"but. I will repeat that if we had hncl
5000 troops at Manila on May 1 the city
would have been taken possession of and
we would have had, at least for the time,
no trouble with the natives. They were
our friends then." , ,
The admiral replied that he had said
that between May 1 and August 13 the
Governor had sent word to hfm more
than once that he would be pleased to
surrender to the navy. The first proffer,
he said, was made in May, through the
English Consul, and subsequent proffers
wore made through the Belgian Consul.
At the time, the, admiral admitted, Agui
naldo had begun operations around Ma
nila and was working toward the city.
Taking up the thread of the investiga
tion where it was dropped yesterday. Sen
ator Carmack asked the witness if all the
trouble in the Phlippines had been due to
Aguinaldo.
WASHINGTON, June 28. -The third
day's testimony given by Admiral Dewey
before the Senate^Committee on the Phil
ippines began with a reference to the
statement made by the admiral at the
first day*3 proceedings concerning the
proffer made by the Spanish Governor
General to surrender to him. v Senator
Carmack called attention to the fact that
the press made it appear that he had
said during the next twenty-four hours
after the destruction of the Spanish neec
on May 1 there had been several proffers
of surrender on the part of the Governor.

thoroughly with the medicine, full
strength, which , instantly removed the

A man should want to be. a- man in the fullest sense, in perfect health and

a cure come spontaneously. Help must be given;, nature receiving help
from skillful hands; conditions made normal; cause of trouble thoroughly
and .completely. eradicated from the system. Such being the case it be-
hooves the suffering man to select his Physician carefully, and one who
is skilled; a man of long and broad experience; one whose successful
treatment-has been most marked; a man of unquestioned reputation in his
?specialty.. Â¦ In -fact, tan-, honorable, conscientious, skilled physician. Such
a man Dr.- Meyers & Co. offer you. Â¦ It has been his aim to understand

Archibald Campbell Claims Assistant
Bond Clerk Had XTo Bight
to Take It ,
Archibald -Campbell, . attorney and
bondsman for F. R. Conway.the default-
Ing clerk of Police Judge Mogan's court,
filed a petition with the Supervisors yes
terday for the return of the 5500 bail
money which he f urnished â¢ f or Conway's
appearance, and which was ordered for
feited on Conway's failure to appear for
examination on June 23 last
Campbell states in his petition that he
deposited the $500 with Assistant Bond
and Warrant Clerk J. J. Greeley, who
had no legal authority to accept' any un
dertaking, bond or cash bail in cases of
felony by reason of the provisions of sec
tlcns 1268 and 1269 of the 'Penal Code,
which Campbell alleges gives the . sole
right to a court or magistrate to take
bail. , v â¢,
Following out Judge Sloss' decision,
Campbell further alleges that the provi
sion of the charter authorizing an as
sistant bond and warrant clerk to take
cash bail so far as it applies to felonies
is illegal and void, as being In" conflict
with the State law. , He contends that
the bail could not be legally forfeited.

A. delegation \ from vi the viHodcarrlera 1

Works yesterday to urge that hodcarriera

Le paid $4 per day, instead of $3. It was
explained that the minimum union rate
was $3 and 53 50, but the. men were being
paid as high as $4 In many instances on
private work. Commissioner Casey asked
the representatives If they would be sat
isfied with $3 50, and upon being answered
In the affirmative the board took the
matter under Â¦ advisement. It Â¦ is under

Jn the Third Congressional District
there is no opposIUon to the renomination
of Victor H. Metcalf, and there is no dan
ger that the convention will subordinate
him to the ambition of any other candi
date for office. Republican citizens, how
ever, may be called on, to exercise spe
cial vigilance to prevent: Gage delegates
from stealing Into the convention under
the cloak- of â¢ Metcalf 's popularity. The
push has abandoned al prletense of mak

or time and place in the various districts
for such organization. This will be con
venient for the push, as It will enable the
gang to organize in one district on a cer
tain night and then, after a night's rest
visit another district and resume work
The voters, however, will not be deceived
to any alarming extent Republicans Will
not join a club .that bears the suspicion
of Gageism. The party has had enough

between cattle men and sheep mea,
many of the- latter speak kindly of Ed

discussing the cattle man's chances and
predicting that quite a number of dele

In the Edson camp before the battle is

Landlady Discovers Bodies
When She Goes to
Make Bed.
William Henderson, an ex-soldier, and
James Donovan, at one time a showman
in Manila, met death from asphyxiation
in a room at 133 O'Farrell street some
time yesterday. Their bodies were dis
covered . yesterday afternoon by Miss
Mary Gellispie, landlady of the premises.
According to Miss Gelliaple, Donovan
called at the house last Wednesday and
rented the room. When he rented the
room he informed : her that he would re
main out late at night and requested her
not to wake him in the morning. . '.
Friday night Donovan .was accompanied
to his apartments by Henderson, whom
he invited to spend the night with. him.
Yesterday morning about 5:30 o'clock the
landlady detected the odor of gas. - She.
notified the gas company and a man was
sent to investigate. He discovered a
small leak in one of the pipes downstairs
and plugged it with soap for the time
being. As the odor of gas still permeated
the house, Miss Gellispie says she went
to Donovan's room and knocked. He re
sponded, she. says, and , In answer to her
inquiry said the gas was not escaping In
bis room. - â . .
About 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon,
however, Miss Gellispie went to the room
to make the bed. Opening the door with
a pass key, she entered the apartment
and was met with the overpowering odor
of gas. .
On investigating she found that gas was
escaping from a jet turned full on and
Donovan and Henderson were both in bed.
She called to Donovan, but receiving no
response called W. T. Watters, who-waa
visiting in the house. Watters hurried
to tha room, and after a hasty examina
tion pronounced both the occupants of
the room dead. ,
The Coroner was : notified and took
charge of the. bodies. In Henderson's ef
fects were found discharge papers from
the army, showing that hÂ© had served in
the United States signal corps, that he
was formerly a telegraph operator and
:hat'he was a native of Edinburgh, Scot
and. Donovan's body was identified by
iloward Phillips and H. Marks. .
It is the opinion of the police and the
Coroner that), the men met death - acci
dentally. . . - -..-.:

The decision of Judge de Haven in the
Camou case was that there was no law
of Congress defining as a penal offense
the pasturing of sheep on a Government
forest reserve, the prohibition being ex
pressed in a regulation of the Department
of the Interior, and that Congress could
not legally delegate to the Secretary of
the Interior its power to make laws.
Since the decision was handed down the
Federal authorities have resolved to In
voke judicial Injunctions to prevent the

H. Schumann, broker, 36 Geary street,
secured a warrant from Judge Fritz yes
terday for the arrest of Robert Lawless, a
race horse man, on a charge of grand lar
ceny by trick and device. Schumann al
leges that on April 16 last Lawless offered
to sell him the race horse St. Ftancis for
$75. They went to the Leepalmer saloon,
where Schumann handed the $73 to Law
less who asked to be excused for a few
minutes till he got the bill of sale. Law
tees left the saloon and Schumann says he
has not seen him since nor has he got
possession of the horse.
Lawless was arrested November 18, 1S97.
for playing sharp tricks upon business
men and others, among- them Edward M.
Greenway, the society leader, and was
booked on two. charges of obtaining
money by false pretenses. The charges
were later changed to petty larceny and
he was tried by a Jury In the late Judge
Campbell's court. on the Greenway charge
and acquitted. The other charge was dis
missed. He used to telephone. to his vic
tim, representing he was a friend, asking
him to pay charges on a parcel that would
be delivered. The parcel generally con
tained bottles filled with water. .
Lawless did not profit by the lesson and
on February 24, 1SS8, he was arrested for
tending a forged telegram to Henry, Mil
ler of Miller & Lux, with intent to de
fraud him. ; He was convicted In- the" Su
perior Court and on May 7 was sen
tenced to serve one year in the County
Jail on that charge and another year for
felony. ' "' 'Â¦. : r

boards, from the lower' deck.? Knight and
another passenger named Herrick were
on the upper deck, and, becoming fright
ened, went overboard. An alarm I was
given â¢ at once and several life preservers
and chairs were thrown to the swimmers.
Knight caught hold of two chairs and
Herrick caught a piece of board, and they
were thus enabled to keep afloat. As the
sea. was very rough, the ship's officers
decided that more time would be saved
by 'moving the steamer toward the im
periled men than by sending out the life
boats. The vessel got within fifteen feet
of Knight and a line was thrown to him,
but he failed to catch it. The- steamer
then drifted away, came ' up again, and
the line was again thrown close to him.
but he madfe no effort to catch it and sank
a" few seconds later. Herrick caught an
other line and was rescued. â¢
â¢ ThÂ© Inspectors exonerated the captain
aiidcrew of the Warrior.

District Attorney Rives of Los Angeles
end the Governor do not agree as to the
manner in which the care Â»hou'd be
handled. Gage's attorneys made a. re
quest several days ago upon the District
Attorney that he prepare the necessary
effldavits, go to San Francisco and appeal
to the Supreme Court for a writ of pro
hibition to prevent Judge Fritz from in
terfering in the case in any manner' and
to direct that the defendants be brought
before Justice Downing at once. This ac
tion Rives positively refused to take, and
It is said there was a" stormy consulta
tion. District Attorney Rives remained
firm, however, and without his conEent
Gage's attorneys could do nothing.
He will simply continue the cases. Jus
tice Downing has received no official noti
fication that the defendants have been
currendered by their bondsmen in San
Tranclsco and that habeas corpus pro
ceedings are pending there, but he will
take judicial knowledge of that . fact,
Respite the wishes of the attorneys on
the other Elde. He takes the view that
If the defendants have been "surrendered
there are now no bonds for him to declare
forfeited, and further that if the habeas
corpus proceedings have been set for
Monday in a higher court than his' it is
not fcr him to take action until that
higher court disposes of the case.
Several euch witnesses were found.
They were told what they will be asked
â¢when the case comes to trial and other
wise informed as to what will be desired
of them. Although Justice Downing will
not discuss the case in any way, it Is un
derstood en good authority, that he will
i.ot declare the bonds of Messrs. Spreck
els end Leake forfeited when they fall to
appear in his court on Monday, nor will
te issue bench warrants.
EAK PEDRO, June ZLâ Governor Gage,
lAssistant District Attorney Johnstone
Jonet end Attorney Horace Appell spent
most of the day here to-day . preparing
tor the trial of the criminal libel action
Â» gainst Messrs. Spreckels and Leake.
There were no proceedings In that case
to-day In Justice Downing" s court, and
they did not visit that court, but spent
their time among known friends of the
Governor. Several of these friends were
eomisiEsioned to find persons who had
read the article In The Call upon which
the criminal libel action is based. It being
of course necessary for Gage to find such
persons here and . u*e them, as witnesses
to prove that the alleged libel was circu
lated here.

The officers of the council are greatly
encouraged with the olxers of support al
ready received from various quarters.
They say that their fight is practically
won and that if any attempt is made to
lock out brotherhood men the City Front
Federation will take a hand In the pro
ceedings. All of the haulers of lumber
along the water front are in sympathy
with the brotherhood and if they are dFs
criminated against by the contractors or
unions of the Building Trades Council
the lumber men and stevedores say they
will refuse to handle building materials.
Many of the contractors realize that this
is no empty threat and this In a measure
accounts for the dissatisfaction prevail
ing in the association ranks.
A large turnout la expected at the meet-
Ing of the brotherhood " carpenters " to
morrow night. Sixteen hundred carpen
ters haye been requested to attend and
reports from, the loyal â¢ unions . indicate
that a great majority of that number will
be in attendance. ' '
OFETCEBS ENCOUBAGED.
All members of the brotherhood are instruct
ed to attend the general meeting to be held at
Turk-street Temple, Monday evening. June 30.
at 8. o'clock, at which time the present con
troversy will be discussed. Instructions from
the general officers of the .United Brotherhood
will be given. The alleged resolutions adopt
ed by the builders will be explained.
Business- agents are Instructed that when
ever a contractor locks 'out a brotherhood car
penter, they shall call off all brotherhood men
on any of Bald contractor's jobs."
Â¦-' The/district council, of the. United "Brother
hood of Carpenters and Joiners of 'America
hereby gives Instructions that in case of the
discharge of any ' brotherhood Â« members by a
contractor, all fellow members working for
said contractor are " to cease -work Immediate

A meeting has been called for to-mor
row evening, at which time the con
tractors will seek to adopt some plan
which is likely to have more satisfactory
results. It. was said last night that the
objectionable resolution would be re
scinded and that the ; Building Trades
Council would be told 'in plain language
that. It would have to fight its own tat
tles with ! the brotherhood carpenters
without the aid of the â¢ contractors. If
this action is taken the danger of a-lock
otit and '.consequent troubles 1 this week
will be reduced to a minimum. .-,

MEETING IS CALLED.
Since the association officially declared
its intention to stand by the"; Building
Trades Council and discriminate against
the brotherhood carpenters most of the
members have come to a realization of
what the proposition really is. , One con
tractor said yesterday that to carry the
resolution into effect meant a complete
paralysis of building . operations in San
Francisco. -The contractors are inclined
to be fair," but none is desirous of injur
ing himself ,for the sake of a sentimeut
that divides the union carpenters of the
city. The '/alKing members of the asso
ciation deciare they will not stand by the
resolution and that if any. attempt is
made to enforce it Tuesday they will de
sert the association. , >. , ..-.-.
The dissatisfied contractors are* among
the largest in ..the city, : all;; employing
brotherhood men. To -.lock . out -.*. their
working forces would virtually be tanta
mount to taking money but of," their own
pockets; as the stoppage of their work
necessarily involves heavy financial loss.
These contractors declare that the reso
lution adopted at a previous meeting of
the association at the behest of frienas of
P. H. McCarthy of the Building Trades
Council did not represent the wisn of the
majority by. a great deal; and that its
passage was eltected by only a dozen
votes. In fact, it is said, tne greater
number oÂ£ the contractors, present at the
meeting were not aware of ., the purport
of the resolution or under no circum
stance's would they have voted for the
measure. . :Â¦'.'Â¦ ' Â¦

BALLIET IS ANXIOUS
Â¦FOR ANOTHER TRIAL
Man Convicted of Using the Mails
Fraudulently Accuses the
Juryr^
DES MOINES, Iowa, June 28.â Judge
Charles Al Bishop of the Supreme Court
filed a motion for a pew trial to-day on
behalf of Letson Balliet, who was found
guilty three weeks ago by a jury in the
UiJted States District Court of using the
n: alls with intent to defraud. The grounds
f pr the motion are chiefly technical. Em
mett- Callahan of Baker City, Or., BaU
Het's Western attorney, joins with Judge
Bishop in, the application for a rehearing
of the case. .
There are nineteen counts in the mo
tion. One of the most sweeping charges
ip the paper Is that the "verdict is clearly
the result of passion and prejudice on the
part of the jury trying the case." The de
fendant's attorneys declare that "the evi
dence in this case falls to show that any
offense such as that charged In the In
dictment was committed by the defend
ant." Jn . conclusion the petition says:
'.'The court erred Jn instructing the jury
that if defendant as a witness had not
fully explained matters material to the
issues in the case and which were natur
ally within his knowledge, then the jury
might consider such a circumstance as
tending to show that the facts, Jf ex
plained, would bear out the contention of
the Government and that his failure to
explain them Is against him."
The motion for a new trial has been for
warded to Judge Munder of Omaha, who
presided over the trial in which Balliet
was found guilty. 4 A time for hearing
arguments on the motion will be probably
set in the. near future.

THE DAY'S DEAD.
Jones says Tracy is the most desperate
criminal in the country. He believes that
Tracy is making for the Utah Mountains,
where he knows every fastness.
A year ago Robert Jones went to Salem
and asked for Tracy. He was shown a
room where convicts were cutting stone.
Jones at once, recognized Tracy. The con
vict turned and saw Jones, whom he be
lieved to be dead, and almost collapsed.
Jones left without a word.
Tracy was not recaptured and was next
heard of in Portland in 1898, when he and
Merrill were sentenced to fourteen years
in the Salem Penitentiary for robbery.
Jones was jailer in the Pike County,
Colo., jail in 1897 and during that year
Harry Tracy was . imprisoned there for
the murder of a man named Hovle in
Utah. Tracy and another prisoner. named
Lant had escaped from a Utah prison and
were recaptured after a fight In Rout
County, Colo. That country had no
strong jail and the murderers were, taken
to Aspen. Â¦ . .
On June 19 Jones had given them their
supper and Â¦ leaned over to pick up the
dishes. Like a flash . Tracy dealt Jones
a blow upon the head with an iron bar,
which he had concealed. Jones was
struck two more blows as he fell. Tracy
took the keys and revolver from the jail
er's pockets and he and Lant escaped.
Jones, after a hard fight with death, re
covered. His head is deeply marked with
the scars of the convict's blows.
Deputy Sheriff McKay of Ellensburg
and Guard Carson of Walla Walla ar
rived to-day at Castle Rock with blood
hounds, but were unable to pick up the
trail. Sheriff Huntingdon of Cowlitz
County has arrived at Wlnlock and taken
charge of the pursuing party there. After
resting.' the bloodhounds will again start
after the fugitives. ' f
REDDING, June 28.â Robert W. Jones,
who was jailer in the Aspen, Colo., jail
in 1S97 and who was reported to have
been killed by Harry Tracy while the lat
ter was preparing to escape from that
jail, is in Redding. Jones had not told
of his experience with Tracy until to-day,
when he made a statement that surprised
his friends.
TACOMA, June 28.^-Tracy and Merrill,
ihe escaped Oregon convicts, were seen
yesterday and again this morning in the
woods near Winlocjc. They were heavily
armed. The outlaws were seen yesterday
i by Section .Foreman Gaume and his men
a half-mile east of Alnslie. They claimed
they were going to Toledo and started
down the military road in. that direction.
A son of James Ferrier of Little Falls
traveled with them for a mile. He says*
they were very : nervous and held their
rifles in readiness when they saw any one
â¢approaching. Seeing a tramp lying along
side the track they raised their rifles to
*fire. His identity was revealed and they
desisted. They, told- the boy they were
soldiers looking for Tracy and Merrill.

SPOKANE, June 28.-WhiIe . B. W.
Brantley, a prospector, was pinned to the
ground by a mass of rock, he witnessed
the slow suffocation - of his only son.
Brantley was unable to move, but his
head was free of the. earth which had
fallen upon him during a cave in a pros
pect hole where he was working. /After
the death of his son, at about 4 o'clock in
the afternoon, Brantley* remained in his
perilous position until nearly noon s the
next day, when a party of rescuers found
him half dead from exposure and mental
agony.
The tragedy occurred on Big Creek,
about' six' miles Â«ast of Kellogg, Idaho, a
Small town in the Coeur d'Alenes. News
of It came to-day, when the son s body
Â¦was brought to Kellogg for burial.
Brantley and the lad were working in
the prospect together. The hole was but
a few feet deep. Suddenly a cave oc
curred, catching Brantley andy pinning
nim to' the ground. : ' Â¦
His son, who is 14 years of age. tried to
assist his father, but a second cave con
curred and the boy was buried, while
more earth was thrown upon the father.
The boy talked with his father and said
"Good-by" as he was slowly expiring.
Brantley said to-day that only a/ little
earth covered the lad, but his limbs were
pinned down. Brantley passed a horrible
right of vigil near the body of his eon,
being unable to move an inch.
Brantley's family, alarmed at the non
return of father and son, organized a
starching party in the morning and the
man was rescued from his perilous posi
tion. The terrible night had nearly be
reft him of his reason. Bud Brantley,
the .boy, was a popular young fellow.

Early next month there will arrive fr6m
Montreal . the machinery for a dredge, which
will t>e operated on the auriferous gravel de
jofcits of tbe Stewart River. It is estimated
that the dredge will be able to handle from
HW to 1000 cubic yards of gravel per day. The
contract fox 1 the construction of the machinery
for the dredge vÂ«t awarded some months ago
to the Laurie Engine Works of Montreal, and
It will be shipped the latter part of this month.
The dredge was designed by Professor A. W\
Bct-trtson atld the machinery was prepared
under his personal supervision. Professor Rob
erteon war the designer of the big suctiou
flredpe' King Edward, which is now operating
on . the Fraevr River n<?ar Chllllwack. The
concessions on the Btewart River on which the
<2re<3fe will operate ere owned by the Golden
Crown Mining Company, of which William
Cffllvle. ex-Commissioner cf the Yukon, is man
aging director. The concessions include 110
miles on tk* fitewart River. The hull of the
dredge was to have been constructed in this
city and tome correspondence passed between
local contractors and Professor Robertson, but
no contract was awarded, so It is concluded the
buil will be built on the Yukon.
Another large fmelter Is liable to be
added to Ihft mining equipment of Shasta

As the total assessed valuat ion of Â«-he c omUy
In the same year was fl,SbJ.3.J6. tne total
value of the mineral product was 22 per cent
ot the total assessed valuation of the county,
lnvo at present leads all other counties of
California in the production of eoda and lead.
One of the largest undeveloped copper
belts of the State, so reads a bulletin
just issued by the State Mining Bureau,
is In the Saline Valley, in Inyo County.
This fact has been known to geologists,
but to many others the announcement
â¢will be a surprise. The fact illustrates
the wide distribution of copper ores in
California. The same bulletin contains a
collection of other mineral facts of inter
est concerning the county which lies be
tween the Sierras and the State of Ne
vada. More than 35,000 acres of niter land
have been located in the southeastern
portion of the county, but are not ret de
veloped. Oil indications are. favorable in
Owens Valley and natural gas has been
discovered about Owens Lake. Hot
springs are numerous, notably the Â«ey

Large quantities of dolomite awaat better

Marble, from Inyo County was used In
the construction of the Mills building in
San Francisco. The deposits of borax
and salt are large. Owens Lake is the
largest producer of natural soda in the
United States. Quartz mining is steadily
growing in importance. The county is
especially rich in lead ores, carrying goid
as well as silver. Quantities of antimony
are found in the Wild Rose district. Sil
ver mining was once an important indus
try in the county, but now silver comes
from the gold and lead ores, bulphate of

Â¦Uncle deny that Walter was his son.
Uncle seemed to be a little bit out of hu

are getting too smart. I will send for a
lawyer and make a little change in my
will.' "
"Shortly before the death of, Uncle
Hubbard my mother, in the presence of
Uncle Hubbard. asked Bud if he denied
having made this statement. Bud said:

declared within a week. An order to
strike would be obeyed by the boiler
makers here, but they do not disguise the
fact that they are much against, a pro
ceeding of that kind. They argue that
the Western strikers should be willing to
bear their own burdens in this particular
instance.

sented by the" men and refused by the
re.llroad officials were for a 3 per cent in
crease in salary, reinstatement of all dis
charged machinists and no piece work.
There is also the likelihood that the
Grand Jury will call for further testi
mony in the main investigation. That
depends in large measure upon the atti
tude of the District Attorney toward the
evidence already presented as affecting
Daniels. Dalton and Oakes, There la a
mass of testimony at present not trans
cribed, and the District Attorney must
depend upon the reading from the stenog
rapher's notes to get the whole effect of
the cases as they stand. He is in touch
with the Grand Jury to advise them con
cerning the law and to inform them as
to the offense that may be charged
against any or all of the men under in
vestigation.
District Attorney Allen was In consul
tation with the jury for a short time.
It- is by no means certain that the Grand
Jury will render a final report on Tues
day. In view of the disclosures which
have been made concerning the methods
employed in handling county printing, it
is strongly suspected that there will be
an overhauling of the system by which
the supplies in this connection have been
manipulated. -

The Grand Jury has delayed final ac
tion in the investigation of the chargc3
against County Assessor Henry P. Dalton
and G. B. Daniels, manager of the En
quirer Publishing Company. After a twa
hours' session this morning the body ad
journed. <at noon until .Tuesday rooming
at 10 o'clock.
Â¦Speculation concerning the causÂ£ for
the postponement of the tiling or a re
pcrt was lively. The cause of the delay
was in large measure duo to the desiru
oC" District Attorney Allen /or more time
In which to- examine the testimony al
ready presented touching the connection
ot Manager Daniels with the alleged con
spiracy in the matter of the JloOO book
deal. :: . ,
It is also well authenticated that the
Grand Jury is not yet ready to return
bills against Russell, Stedraan and M. da
L. Hadley of the Enquirer, whose offense
is, according to the uncovering of evi
dence, the concealment, of alleged crime.
The rehearing of the cases as affect
ing Hadley and Stedman leaves the way
open now for the expression of a doubt
whether the Grand Jury will return in
dictments against these* men. In fact, It
has become current talli that the moves
made to-day are indicative of the with
drawal of the bills which the Grand Jury
voted the other day to have dr^wn and
brought before them by the District At
torney. Â»
The only witness before the Grand Jury
to-day was Deputy County Clerk FranU
H. Mason, who has charye of the bills
and claims that Â¦ are filed against the

the claims passed for the $1300 worth ot

Says New National Spirit
Is Now Animating
Irishmen.
Volunteers Hold Patriotic
Exercisss in Metropolitan
Temple. t
Hundreds of prominent Irish-American
citizens gathered in Metropolitan Temple
last night to participate in the patrictic
celebration, which was given by the Irish
volunteers in anticipation of the time
when Ireland will be an independent na
tion. The stage in the temple was at
tractively decorated. Across the pros
cenium was stretched an immense Amer
ican flag, which was flanked on both sides
with many smaller flags, some of which
bore on their folds tho Irish harp, while
others were imprinted with the stars and
stripes. Beneath the banners flowers and
green shrubbery were arranged about"the
stage, while in the center was a repre
sentation of the Irish harp, made of blaz
ing lights and symbolizing the rekindling
of the Irish national spirit.
Rev. McDona delivered the ad
dress cSf the evening. The programme,
which consisted principally of stirring
Irish melodies, was well calculated to
carry the minds of those present back to
the days of '98 and other times wh.en the
Irish heroes gave their life blood for the
nation they loved.
THE RIGHT TO RULE.
T. J. Mellot acted as chairman of tfie
celebration and in opening the pro
gramme said that Irishmen were but do
ing their duty in celebrating "Ireland a
Nation." He said that the right to rule
came from the people and that the Irish
race had never given any one the right
to domineer over its people. In introduc
ing Father McDona he said that the
speaker was clothed In the garb of Fath
er Murphy of '98.
Father McDona spoke encouragingly of
Ireland's brightening prospects of once
again becoming a sovereign state. He,
said that the Irish people did not want
home rule, but that they desired absolute
independence. He spoke of the success
ful manner in which little Cuba had
coped with the power of mighty Spain
and described how the British lion had
been forced to cower before the little re
publics of South Africa. He said that the
Irish people would never again gain in
dependence by talking, but that the Irish
men of to-day would have to emulate the
heroism of their forefathers and draw
the sword. â¢
The speaker told how Ireland had been
passing through a dark night, during
which all her hopes of independence had
grown dim and her men had died of very
despair at the f orlornness of her cause.
DAWN IS BREAKING.
But he declared that the dawn of hope
and of a new -national spirit was Just
beginning to break in the East. Father
McDona's patriotic \ sentiments were
vigorously applauded.
The programme in full was as follows:
Overture, national airs of Ireland, Professor
P. W. d'Arcy; introductory, by chairman, T. J,
Mellott; Gaelic solos, (a) "The Minstrel Boy'*
(Og-Laoc na Rann), . (b) "The Green Above the

YACHT UNCLE SAM WINS
THE -KAISER'S GOLD CUP
Kiel Regatta, Under Emperor Wil-
Ham's Patronage, Proves Most
Brilliant Yachting Event.
KIEL, June 28.â Emperor William has
made the Kiel regatta the most brilliant
yachting event in Europe this year. The
English yachtsmen agree that it sur
passes the Cowes meetings which have
occurred during the two years of the
South African war.
Under his Majesty's personal stimulus
one hundred racing craft were brought
together, a quarter of them being French,
British, Swedish, Danish and American
vessels. Most of them are small raters,
but ten or twelve are large vessels and
represent some of the best work of Brit
ish and American builders. Emperor Wil
liam's judicious distributions of the Invi
tations made the event distinctly interna
tional. Some twenty beautiful gold and
silver cups, the prizes in the regatta, are
set out on a table at the Yacht Club.
Nine of them are gifts of his Majesty,
the Empress and Prince Henry of Prus
sia.
His Majesty called on Mrs. Ogden Goe
let on the Nahma Thursday. She, follow
ing custom, first left her card on board
the imperial yacht Hohenzollern. Tho
Kmperor was jolly and chatty while on
Mrs. Goelefs yacht. He remarked that
he had been on board many yachts, but
the Nahma was the finest he had ever
seen. Â¦ /
The Uncle Sam, owned by F. B. Riggs
of New York, won her second race at tho
regatta to-day and the Kaiser's gold cup,
beating the Mimosa of the Hamburg
Club by eleven seconds and the Hansa
of Lubeck by three minutes and thirty
five seconds. There were seven teen start
era and the. course was the sama as that
over which the Uncle Sam sailed 6. win
ning race last Thursday.

Eastern Livestock Market.
Prices of stocks have been lower this week,
with some recovery. The conspicuous feature
of the market has been its dullness. The event
of the week, however, was the announcement
of the dangerou**tllneÂ£s of the King of Eng
land. Tbe elaborate ceremonies in preparation
for the coronation and the sum total of dis
appointment Involved In the postponement gave
the event a sensational character that magni
fied its effect out of proportion to its real
pewer to Influence political or financial affairs.
There is a serious element of loss involved to
the business world of London, and there was
in addition a large speculative commitment on
the hope of trade revival as a result of the
ending of the war in South Africa, which might
ba forced into liquidation should the depress
ing effect of the King's illness check the ex
pected trade revival. There was therefore'
considerable pressure pf American securities for.
London account on tlie New York market. The
London market is heavily Indebted to Paris and
Berlin, and the rate of exchange ran up to
within a shade of the gold export point. Had
it not been for renewed selling by New York
of loan bills in the exchange market it is prob
able that gold would have been exported this
week. The course of the exchange market was
a factor In checking stock market activity.
The improvement in the condition of King Ed
ward and London holidays has relieved the
New York market. Last week's loan expansion
and syndicate requirements left our money
market in no condition to support an active
speculation In any event. The end of the
half-year and the preparations to be made for
dividend and interest disbursements in excess
of any precedent emphasized the need of "a
cautious policy. The market gave evidence of
the guardianship of powerful protectors, never
theless, in the occasional advance of special
stocks, notably the Gould group, St. Paul and
Reading. The drawing out of the coal strike
and the possibility of its early expansion
among the goft-coal miners has been Ignored.
The May reports of the anthracite carrying
roads offer the first opportunity to estimate
the losses involved in the paralysis of the Coal
trade, but the large declines in earnings were
without apparent effect upon the stocks of the
railroads. Some effect has been produced upon
sentiment by signs of discontent In any de
partments of the labor world, but this has
found little active result in the stock market.
The conviction in the financial district Is that
the prosperity of the country Is on the whole
stilt well maintained. The sustained high
level of railroad earnings at average increases
over last year, the volume of bank clearings,
especially outside the speculative centers, and
the extraordinary activity of the Iron trade
are taken as corroborative evidence of this.
Confidence is general that the year's crops will
be large, notwithstanding the reports of un
seasonable weather for corn and for wheat
crops. There remains some misgiving regard-
Ing the course of the money market during the
fall, when the demand for currency and the
maturing of foreign loans may converge upon
New York. There Is a notable neglect of the'
industrial stocks as a class, with United States
fiteel as a leader. The heavy and neglected
tone of \ these stocks is attributed to uncertainty
regarding their financial organization and the
issue of bonds ahead of the stocks to provide
working capital or for improvements or other
purposes. The passing of the dividend on Colo
rado Fuel and on American Ice preferred this
week has tended to increase the uneasiness of
the holders of this class of securities. So the
conclusion has been reached by the Journal of
Commerce that the amount of new capital em
barked In new corporations competing with the
â¢rreat concerns has greatly exceeded the actual
new capital placed In the combinations them
selves. The disposition of old heads of con
stituent companies forced out by the combina
tions to embark In new competing enterprises
It a characteristic of the new order of. things.
Tbe dÂ«U bond market has moved mostly In
NEW YORK, June 28. â The general stock
market to-day was practically inert. There
were Â£ome manipulations in specific stocks, but
they had no marked effect on the general list.
The bank statement did not reflect any notable
recuperation, but the condition of the banks
is weil maintained despite the week's syndi
cate operations and preparations which have
presumably been made for the July settl lent.
The statement was considered negatively fa
vorable, therefore. There is an expectation.
however, that there may be some shifting of
loans -on Monday. To-day's money and ex
change markets were nominal, but sterling ex
change at Paris fell half a centime, thus nar
rowing the margin between the point of profit
on eold shipments. Foreign bankers believe
gold may go out next Week. Of to-day's spe
cial movements tbe rise In Chicago and Eastern
Illinois was due to a suggestion that the treas
ury stocks of the road may be distributed to
shareholders. Illinois Central was moved up a
fraction above the price touched on the day the
new stock issue was announced and closed at
the top. The general market ran off slightly
at the close. Tbe report of a voluntary increase
of 10 per cent in wages by the United States
Steel Corporation seemed to make these stocks
firm. The closing was rather heavy.

Prune growers are exercised over thÂ» re
ported short sales of 1902 Prunes as low as
2%c basis for the four sizes. This is below
cost of production, and it Is incredible . that
anybody should make such low prices. ' The
New Yorkers have seized the opportunity to
hammer the market, and have reduced their
bids to 2%c. The California packers are gen
erally asking 2%@2%c basis, and are refus
ing to sell for less. Still, somebody is evi
dently cutting under. No such disposition to
hammer other new fruits is shown. The new
crop is still two months off; and conditions
may rectify themselves In the meantime.
Otherwise there is nothing new in the situation.
New Peaches are being quoted at 4%c for com

Weather Report.
"A private letter from the coast to-day, dis
cussing the /situation on 1902 crop prunes,
etates: 'We' catinot make a lower price than
2%c four size basis on Santa Clara fruit. We
Understand there are a few sellers on the 2%c
four size basis, but incline to believe that the
larger Interests have shown no disposition to
do business at lower than 'the" 2%c basis.
Those selling at 2%c basis are, we
believe, selling sheft. as, . while the
crop prospects are favorable to a
larga output, the growers do not
seem inclined to lower their Views. In our
opinion, with a largely increased export de
mand, due to the short crop in France, which
will be about one-quarter of the average, ac
cording to late advices, and no carry-over to
speak of in old prunes in this country, the
situation is much- mere favorable than is gen
erally supposed. There sh'-uld not be any dif
ficulty in disposing of a crop of, say, 145,000,-
GOO pounds, in view of the fact that upwards
of 100,000.000 pounds have been consumed in
a year when there was practically little export
demand.' "

CHICAGO, June 28.â Wet weather again
caused fair up-turns in grains to-day. Sep
tember wheat ' opened Vtc to %c higher at
<2%c to 72%c and sold to 72%c early.
Throughout the Southwest copious rains had
fallen again to damage the harvest and Paris
was higher. There was a little early com
mission house business and a fair export de
mand developed. The feature of the day was
an improvement In the call for December
options. A bearish sentiment overcast the
pit, however, for some time and worked
against higher prices. Many of the local crowd
took profits and September dropped to 7214c,
closing only firm, %c up at 72%c.
Corn still showed marked strength on the
demand by shorts. Opening prices were very
at SÂ°Â£&; J? horts bidding July % to l%c higher
at 69%@70c â the latter the new record price
for the crop. Profit-taking slumped the mar
ket to 6a%c, but bad crop reports pushed
prices up again. July closed strong, lc up at
1 9 JI, C ; gfP^ em b e r sold at 61 %c, closing firm,
%@%c higher at 61 %c. ' ...
Oats continued their upward course again
to-day. The wet weather was reported as
hurting this cereal worst of all. July closed
strong 1@1% C up at 46%c, after touching 47c.

duction. Our opinion .Is that within a
comparatively short time oil will consid
erably enhance In value. Although this
company has holdings of oil lands aggre
gating more than 100,000 acres, the board
of directors deem it prudent to conserve
the production of the company as much
as possible for the higher prices which
the future holds and buy while the low
priced oil may be had."
The great scope of the Union Oil Com
pany and Its extensive holdings make this
exposition of policy of value to all hold
ers of oil lands in the State. Since the
organization of the company It has paid
out in dividends more than $1,000,000, has
invested in plant nearly another million
and estimates its total net earnings at
$3,027,000 In round figures.
Concerning the inferences to bÂ« drawn
from the report the Los Angeles Herald
cays:
To some extent It is a lifting of the curtain
that hides from public view the Internal work-
Ing of the second largest oil company in the
State, and the one ' that has . been from its
Inception identified with this State. By reason
of Its position It can diagnose conditions bet
ter than the average oil -producer, and for that
reason the extensive plans being laid by the
Union for future business, as well as the ex

Within the next few weeks our Fullerton pipe
line, which at present terminates at the rail
road station of Bixby and Norwalk, respective
ly, will be extended to the city of Los Ange

the pipe Is already on the ground, and the
work is being, energetically pushed. When
completed this line will connect the oil fields
of /Whittier, Fullerton and Brea Canyon i and
the city of Los Angeles with tidewater. Our
barkentlne, which has a carrying capacity of,
1C000 barrels, and which haa been christened
the "Fullerton," was auspiciously launched on
June 12 and will bo finished and ready I for
service in July. Considerable progress has
been made on ouf new 10,000-barrel steamer,
which has been under contract since the first of
the . year. Our business has grown to .such . an
extent, however, that still another and larger
' vessel â¢ will have to be provided. One Â¦ 55,000
and twe 37,500 barrel tanks has been erected
in. the Hawaiian Islands, and several others of
the latter size will shortly be completed there,
Imaking a total tankage in those islands of 277,
000 barrels. Our new > refinery at Bakersfield
Is about completed, and has commenced oper
ations, and additional storage Â¦ tanks are be
ing erected there also. '. A large amount of ad
ditional tankage will also be required in con
nection with the pipe line extensions above
referred to. .Other enlargements and exten
sions of the business are in contemplation. .'
Concerning the plans of. the company
the report sets forth much that is of gen

is in part as follows:

WJien It Is Free of Dandruff, It
Grows i/uxuriantly.
Hair preparations and dandruff cures,
es a rule, are sticky or irritatLig affairs
that do no earthly good- Hair, w^hen not
diseased, grows naturally luxuriantly.
Dandruff is the cause of nine-tenths of all
hair trouble, and dandruff is caused by
a germ.. The only way to cure dandruff
is to kill the germ: and. so far, the only
liair preparation that will positively de-
etroy the germ is Newbro's Herpicideâ
absolutely harmless, free from grease,
6ediment, dye matter or dangerous drugs.
It allays itching Instantly, makes hair
grlossy and soft as silk. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect"â dandruff.
