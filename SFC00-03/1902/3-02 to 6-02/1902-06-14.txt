Subsequently, in response to the address

who have been engaged in fighting their
country's battles. They have been op

These difficulties were . cheerfully over

those who were our opponents will now,
I rejoice to think, become our friends.

OPELAKA. Ala., June 13.â The business
portion of Alexander City, a place of 1500
inhabitants, was wiped away to-day by
fire, the loss reaching at least $750,000,
which the insurance will not begin to
cover.
The fire originated in a foundry and
machine works. A light wind was blow
ing and the fire spread from building to
building until the entire business section
was ablaze. The place had no water
works and all the terror-stricken people
could do was to save -what belongings
they could and then flee from the N awful
heat. The station of the Central of Geor
gia Railway was burned, with all its con
tents. The telegraph office, two hotels,
postoffice, saloons, livery stable, practic
ally all the stores and eight residences,
together with numerous law and other
offices, were destroyed. The railroad has
established its telegraph line under a tree
and appeals for help and for food are go

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDOX, June 13.â A statement by the
local Venezuelan committee is published
by the papers this morning claiming the
revolution In Venezuela has succeeded.
The committee expresses the belief that
the insurgents have already captured
Caracas.
WASHINGTON, June 13.-Secrctary
Hay has requested from Minister Bowen
at Caracas, by cable, a statement of the
condition of affairs of Venezuela, par
ticularly-with reference to shipping.- Some
time ago 'the National Asphalt Company
was considerably embarrassed in its ef
forts to provision and otherwise supply
its force of employes at La Fellcidad, by
reason of a clash between the Government
lorces and the insurgents on the coast
near that point. The Venezuela Consul at
Â¦tf r illemstad, island of Trinidad, refused
to clear the company's ship Viking for
the mainland because her destination was
in the hands of the insurgents and was
in a state of blockade. With a good deal
of difficulty Bowen succeeded in getting
the vessel through, it being especially
Â¦urged that the company's employes were
in great distress for lack of supplies.
Now the Orinoco Trading Company is
having similar trouble in operating its
ships between the Venezuelan ports
which are occupied indiscriminately by
Government and rebel forces, and the
State Department is endeavoring to see
what can be done to end these annoy
ances. . .
PANAMA. ' Colombia. June 13.â A
schooner loaded by the Jaunch Aurora |
yesterday landed 200 Government froops
at Chorrcra, fifteen miles from Panama.
A telegraph inspector left overland to-day
for Chorrera with^ the object of establish
ing a" line into' the interior.
â¢ A flotilla of eight sailing vessels started
last night with 'reinforcements for Gen
eral Barti's troops at Pescaderias. Great
excitement prevails here and will con- |
tinue until the result of the attack on the
rebels at Agua Dulce is known.
Governor Salizar says he will send next
â¢week an important Government official
to construct the civil administration- of
the recaptured province, and that he ex
pects to hear soon that the revolution is
confined to Chirioui.
HAVANA, June 13.â The Board of Im
migration decided to-day that forty-three
Chinese laborers who came .to Havana on
brard the Ward line steamer Monterey
from New York and reached here last
Wednesday -would have to be returned to
New York by the steajnship company.
Heretofore Chinamen have been allowed
to enter Havana without restriction and
thousands have landed here in the course
of the last tlirce years. An immigration
law, however, similar to the one enforced
in the United States went into force last
May, and the case of these Chinamen has
resulted in the" first application of this
law. Â¦ The forty-three Chinamen In ques
tion came direct from China and were
shipped in bond from Vancouver through
New York to Havana.
The Ward line has asked the privilege
of shipping the Chinamen to Mexico in
stead of returning them" to New York, as
the Chinamen themselves have requested
to be sent to that country. The Board of
Immigration has not yet given a decision
in the latter matter. Q . '"'
Major Glenn", chief of the United States
Marine Hospital Service in Cuba, says he
has no doubt that many Chinamen have
entered j the' United \ States through Cuba
during the. last three years by means of
sailing vessels running ' between Cuban
and Southern ports.
The Cubans take kindly to the new im
migration law. The colored laborers of
the Island- are especially prejudiced

received some time * ago . to bring the
transports which have been lying in the
stream off San Francisco . to Sausalito,
to remain until they were sold by the
Government. One of them was towed
over several days ago and anchored in
Richardsons Bay. .â¢
-- This morning at 9 o'clock the tug Slo
cum towed the Rosecrans across the bay
and was preparing to bring her to an an
chorage ! off South Sausalito. The tide
was running in shore quite swiftly and
in some manner the transport sot away
frorrrthe tug and ran high up on the
beach. For a time it was feared she
would drive on the rocks, but the Slocum
succeeded in preventing this and finally
was able to draw the ship back from the
beach. \ . L â -.
An examination showed that no uamage
had resulted. . At the present time the

The ' message was listened to with

of Senators was notably large. The chair
announced that the message would be re

BAILEY IS FACETIOUS.
We are a wealthy and powerful nation; Cuba
is a young republic, still weak, who owes to us
her birth, whose whole future, whose very life
must depend on our attitude toward her. I ask
that we help her as she struggles upward along
.the painful and difficult road of self-govern
ment and Independence. I ask this aid for her
because she is weak, because she needs It, be
cause we have already aided her. I ask that
open-handed help, of a kind which a self-re
specting people can accept, be given to Cuba,
for the, very reason that we have given her such
help in the past. Our soldiers fought to give
her freedom, and for three years our representa
tives, civil and military, have tolled unceasing
ly, facing disease of a peculiarly sinister and
fatal type with patient and uncomplaining for
tltudeT to teach her hew to use aright her new
freedom. Never In history has any alien coun
try been thus administered, with such high
integrity of purpose, such wise judgment and
such a single-handed devotion to the country's
interests. Now I ask that the Cubans be given
all possible chance to use to the best advantage
the freedom of which Americans have such
right to be proud and for which so many Amer
ican lives have been sacrificed. * Â«

Cuba is an independent republic which has
assumed certain special obligations as regards
her international In compliance with
our request. I alk for her certain special eco
nomic concessions in return; these economic con
cessions to benefit us as well as her. There are
few brighter pages in American history than
the page which tells of our dealings with Cuba
during the past four years. Â¦ On her behalf we
waged a war, of which the malnsprln" was gen
erous Indignation against oppression, and we
have kept faith absolutely. It Is earnestly to
be hoped that we will complete in the same
spirit the record so well begun, and show In
our dealings with Cuba that steady continuity
of policy which It Is essential for our nation
to establish in foreign affairs if we desire to
play well our part as a world power.

PLEADS FOE REPUBLIC.
Some of our citizens opposed the lowering of
the tariff on Cuban products, just- as three
years ago they opposed the admission .of the
Hawaiian Islands, lest free trade with them
might ruin certain of our Interests here. In
the actual event their fears, proved baseless
as regards Hawaii, and their apprehensions as
to the damage to any Industry of our "Own be
cauce of the proposed measure of reciprocity
with Cuba seem to me equally baseless. In my
judgment no American industry will be hurt,
and many industries will be benefited by the
proposed action. It is to our advantage as a
nation that the growing Cuban market should
be controlled by American producers.
The question as to which, if any, of the
different schedules of tariff ought most properly
to be revised does not enter Into this matter
In any .way or shape. "We are concerned with
getting a friendly reciprocal agreement with
Cuba. This arrangement applies to all the
articles that Cuba grows or produces. It ib
not In our power to determine what these ar
ticles shall be, and any discussion of the tariff
as It affects special schedules, or countries other
than Cuba, is wholly aside from the subject
matter to which 1 now call your attention.
Yesterday, June 12, I received by cable from
the American Minister In Cuba a most earnest
appeal* from President Palma for "legislative
relief before It Is too late and .the country,
financially ruined." The granting of reci
procity with Cuba Is a proposition which stands
entirely alone. The reasons for It far out
weigh those for granting reciprocity with any
other nation, and are entirely consistent with
preserving intact the protective system under
which this country has thriven so marvelously.
The present tariff law was designed to promote
the adoption of such a reciprocity treaty and
expressly provided for a reduction not to ex
ceed 20 per cent upon goods coming from a
particular country, leaving the tariff rates on
the same articles unchanged as regards all
other countries. Objection has been made to
the granting of the reduction on the ground that
the substantial benefit would not go to the
agricultural producer of sugar, but would Inure
to the American sugar refineries. ! In my Judg
ment provision can and should be made which
will guarantee us against this possibility, with
out having recourse to doubtful policy, sucn
ae a bounty in thÂ« form of a rebate.
Tliis recommendation waa merely giving prac
tical effect to President McKinley's ! words,
Â¦when In his message of December 5, -1898, and
December 5, 169a, he wrote: - "It is Impor
tant that our relations with this people (of
Cuba) shall be of the most friendly character
and our commercial relations close and recip
rocal. â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢ We have accepted a trust the
fulfillment of which calls' for the sternest In
tegrity of purpose and exercise of the highest
wisdom. The new Cuba yet to rise from the
ashes of the past must needs be bound to us
by ties of singular intimacy and strength if
its enduring welfare is to be assured. The
greatest blessing which can come to Cuba Is
the restoration of her agricultural and indus
trial prosperity."
FALMA SENDS APPEAL.
"Elsewhere I have discussed the question of
reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however,
there are weighty reasons of morality and of
national interest why the policy should be held
to have a peculiar application, and I most
earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom,
indeed, to the vital need, of 'providing for a
substantial reduction in the tariff duties on
Cuban imports Into the United States. Cuba
has in her constitution affirmed what we de
tired, that she should stand. In International
matters, in closer and more friendly relations
with us than with any other power: and we
are bound by every consideration of honor and
expediency to pass commercial measures in the
Interest of her well-being." :
â¢ The Penate and the House: I deem It im
portant before the adjournment of the present
session of Congress to call attention to the fol
lowing expressions in the message which In
the discharge of the duty imposed upon me by
the Constitution ' I sent to Congress the first
Tuetday of December last:
The President's message is as follows r

measure will be accepted by the House.

nothing new or startling in the message,
but it was simply a case of repeating a
former message on the same subject.
"The fact Is," continued the Senator,
"there are about forty Republican Sena

President, and they are not Inclined to
follow his advice on political matters.
Each of these forty thinks he would

and, his party instead of bringing the two

PLEADS FOR THE CUBANS,
The session adjourned without the Sen
ate reaching a conclusion on the question
und no day was fixed for continuing con
sideration, owing to pressure of other
matters. Crozier's confirmation is gen
erally conceded by his opponents.
Senator Cockrell said the appointment
had been made because of the exceptional
fitness of Crozier for the position . and
that he was In every way personally. and
professionally worthy of the compliment
which the appointment implied. He called
attention to Crozier's record as an ord
nance officer and said there were many
precedents for the promotion of officers
from low rank to high, instancing the
cases of General Wood and General Bell
especially. Proctor called attention to
the fact that Generals Wood and Bell
were line officers and not corps officers,
which, he said, made much difference. '
Proctor referred at length to the ef
fect of the law of February 2, 1901, which
it. is declared makes an exception In cases
like that of Crozier. Section 20 of that
law provides that no person shall be ap
pointed chief of the staff corps who is
below " the rank of . lieutenant colonel,
but this provision is accompanied by an
amendment Â¦ providing _f or exceptions. The
friends of Crozier contend that these ex
ceptions open a way for his appointment,
but Senator Proctor argued that such was
not the case and declared that under the
law he clearly was ineligible.
Proctor also referred to the fact that
Crozier is the patentee of the Bumngton-
Crozier gun carriage, and he and others
who stood with him asserted that no offic
er possessing such an interest einould be
put at the head of a bureau which con
trols the use of such patents. He also
asserted that It was unusual to go so
low as the rank of captain in selecting
the heads of staff corps, and said that
this proceeding had had no nrecedent
since the Civil War.
WASHINGTON, June 13.â The Senate
devoted the executive session to-day to
a consideration of the nomination of Wil
liam Crozier to be chief of the bureau of
ordnance. The principal speecnes were
made by Senators Cockrell and Proctor,
the former favoring the confirmation and
the latter opposing that- course.
Tillrr.an cf South Carolina presented
some advantages of supplying metal mail
boxes for rural delivery and showed to

now supplied by private individuals cost

raid, was- a serious burden upon the

Valley Commercial Association met in
this city to-day. Every county In the
valley with the exception of Stanislaus
was represented.
Contrary to expectations, Fresno's ac
tion in withdrawing from the Los Ange
les exhibition work came in for but little
comment and the visiting delegates pro
ceeded to transact their business as
though no rupture- had occurred.. Enough
â¢was done to. show .that the valley asso
ciation proposes to "keep up the work in
Los Angeles in spite of Fresno's action.
It-wtts" concede*! 'tfrat^vFresno still re
mained a member 6f the association, not
withstanding . its decision regarding the
exhibit, which was generally regretted.
The discussion centered around the ad
vertising question and everybody ex
pressed opinions as to what should be
done in Los Angeles and in San Francisco
during the coming encampment of the
Knights of Pythias. The valley undr-ubt
edlywill have a creditable display In San
Francisco and the Los Angeles work will
be continued during the coming year.
The next meeting of the- association will
be held in San Francisco some time dur

The Rev. Mr. Guthrte has played on the
local courts several times during the week
and surprised the cracks by the game he
put up. At one time he held the doubles
championship of Scotland with his broth
er. Mr. Guthrie has an English, style and
in a short time will play an excellent
game. . - , \
Reuben Hunt, the crack player of the
University of California, left for the East
last, month. Hunt will defend his title to
the championship of the Gulf States,
which he won last year.
The match between Miss Hunter and
Mrs. Kincaid of Alameda for the Gutte
Cup was postponed until next Tuesday.
Miss Hunter has already won the tro
phy twice, and needs to win but once
more. She will have to play her best to
win from Mrs. Kincaid, as she is playing
a strong game of late. â¢ . * Â¦ .
Drummond MacGavin is practising hard
for the coming events. He will play with
Smith again this year, and as the Whit
ney brothers have, played but little in the
past year the former are considered to
have a good chance of wresting the
championship honors from, the brothers.
Mrs. Kincaid, a member of the Califor
nia Tennis Club, who took part in the
Ojal Valley tournaments, says May Sut
ton, the coast champion, is the only one
>of the sisters who has shown muoh im
provement over last year. The little
champion plays more accurately and with
more speed. She is sure to carry off the
honors again this year.
The coast' championship events this
year will be by far the largest and. most
important events ever held on the coast.
This will be especially so in the women's
events. Besides the Suttons . and Sey
mours from Southern California, Miss
Dobbins and Miss Schumaker; two young
ladies equally skillful, will be on hand.
The mixed doubles tournament inaugu
rated, last year will .probably be the most
interesting event of the meeting. Bell, the
Southern California champion, will play
with Miss Schumaker, and Mr. Variel,
who with May -Sutton holds the mixed
doubles championship of OJai Valley,
will also take part. Sihsabaugh and Vio
let Sutton, the Southern California cham
pions, will compete.
The park courts are in poor condition at
present. The loose clay was swept oft!
during the. week and the courts are 'full
of holes. Instead of this method of re
pair the courts should have been
well watered and rolled and" then packed
with oil. It will be some time before they"
will be in shape, . as those in charge
seem, inexperienced in the handling of
clay courts.
The scratch singles tournament for the
championship- of the State will be played
on the 2d, 3d and 4th of July. At a meet
ing of the Pacific States Lawn Tennis
Association held last Tuesday it was de
cided the present champion would have
to play in the tournament and not stand
out as in the coast championships. As
there is no challenge cup up this was the
only course left open to the association.
The application of Golden Gate Park
Tennis Club for admission to the asso
ciation was granted. The new club has a
large membership list, which will entitle
it to several delegates. There are al
ready seventy-five members in the club,
and it is safe to say that there will soon
be two hundred. . Â¦ :
ers are out of town by June and the
attendance is light, but this year the
courts are occupied most of tne time dur
ing the week. The cracks will be seen on
the San Rafael courts on Sundays from
now on. All the championship events
will be held on these courts, and as the
weather and surroundings are different
from those in this city, the players will
need considerable practice to become ac
customed to them. Collier, Crowell, Mac-
Gavin, Mitchell, Salisbury, Pratt and
Smith will go across the bay to-morrow.
UNUSUAL activity marks the play
on the tennis courts for this time of
the year. Usually most of the. play-

Permission has been granted the Ariel
and Pioneer oarsmen, who have no quar
ters, to use the South End boathouse. The
South End Rowing Club, knowing its days
at the foot of Third street are numbered,
is creating a fund for moving its boat
house. ; ' '
Nat Berger is pulling regularly in the
outrigged skiff and will probably enter the
Lake Merritt regatta. The intermediate
barge crew of the South Ends Is made up
of Ed Pallas, Sam Berger, .Frank- Pallas
and Matt Harris. The junior barge crew
consists of James P. Foley, Ed Wolff, Dr.
C. C. Dennis" and J. Pallas. Among the
recent additions to the South End Club is
Frank Baker, an Australian, who has had
considerable experience in rowing.
The South End Rowing Club will also
probably enter a crew in the senior barge
race. No crew is in training yet at the
Third-street boathouse, but several senior
men go out together practicing and are
making efforts to get a crew together. The
South End Club will hold tryouts to-mor
row of barge crews and single scullers.
The Portland, Dolphin and Alameda
clubs will be represented in the senior
barge race. The Portland visitors will
use the boathouse of the University of
California on .Sessions Basin as their
headquarters, and a barge will be loaned
them by one of the local clubs.
PREPARATIONS are jcoing on apace
for the Independence day regatta on

to prove highly successful.

CLEVER "WHIPS"
MAY AGAIN BE

Possibility of Reviving
Horse Show Functions
Is Under Consideration
* I 'HE marked success of the third an
i nual open air horse show of Bur
* lingame Country Club, held on the
club grounds Decoration day, has
revived interest in the matter of horse
shows.
The disastrous affair at Ta'nforan two
years ago dulled the interest of the
sportsmen who in other years gave their
time and their money for the -develop
ment of these exhibitions. For various
reasons the exhibition was allowed to
lapse for several years, and a fund of
$6000 accumulated. This amount would
have been ample to finance an Indoor
show in this city.
Instead of so using the money It was
sunk In the Tanfofan venture with an
other $6000, leaving the Horse Show As
sociation In debt. This debt has since
been wiped out by assessment.
The memory of this failure is gradu
ally fading away. This was evidenced
at the Burlingame show, where many
high-class horses were put through their
paces in the ring by clever amateur
"whips." Many new owners have ap
peared on. the scene during the years
which have passed since the last indoor
show In Mechanics' Pavilion, and the
time Is considered ripe for a revival of
the Interesting exhibition. It would open
appropriately the winter season of fes
tivities. .-. " . â¢Â¦Â¦>*â¢'.
These shows, whenever held, have al
ways had the effect of keeping horses
and equipages up to date. This i3 partic
ularly noticeable at San Mateo and Bur
lingame, where smart equipages are the
rule. '" â _â¢ , â¢ Â¦ Â¦
There has been a marked Increase 'In
equestrianism and In road and speeuway
driving In this city in recent years, and
these classes should be. exceptionally
strong. - â¢Â¦ ' Â¦ ". . -
That there . Is much merit In the horse
show is evldeneÂ«d from the great growth of
xhat institution in recent- years, says the
Horseman. While thÂ« patronag? of society
has done much to place the horse show on
the high pinnacltt of success which It now
enjoy?, there must of necessity have been
a great popular support or the modern
horse show would not have achieved 1 its
present high standing, i That which haa
commanded the support and patronage of
the wealthy social circle and the admira
tion of the rank and file of healthy, sport
loving Airiericahs has been the horse Itself.
. Each successive show has had aa>educa
xional effect, with the* Â¦ result that those
who originally admired thÂ« horse have had
their regard for the beautiful equine broad
ened and Intensified. Â¦ On the other hand,
those who toqk but a 1 passing interest In
the horse, who went to the show because it
was the proper thing â¢ or from curiosity,
have developed a truly genuine interest in
man's best four-footed friend. ; Â¦ And ' this
process of education is year Tby year adding
I to the ranks of horse show exhibitors and
horse show spectators. â¢
Fortunately for the best Interests "of the
horse himself, the promoters of the show
are not those who primarily Interested
themselves from motives of financial sain.
As a rule the directors, of horse shows are
gentlemen who took up the horse show be
. cause of their love for the horse and from
the hope that the show would prove to be *
means of interesting others who took but a
slight interest in the horse.
The style of driving haa improved no
ticeably at BuTlingame, and could be
copied to advantage by the frequenters
of Golden Gate Park. While many drive
in good, style; there are still a large
number who adopt a helter-skelter
method which is not desirable. The stand
ard has been raised at Burlingame
through the teachings of such clever pro
fessional whips as " Richard Graham.

Hied to determine It. The police powers
of the municipal legislative bodies are

come into issue, but the court intimated
that the Supervisors had the right to
limit contests to any number they may

for the Nog-ales custom house, has added
another smuggler to the list of those lie
has killed. On Thursday night, while
guarding the Calabasas road, Hollings
head shot Jose Narciso,.the most notori
ous smuggler operating on the Mexican
border. . - . .
Narciso was riding a burro and carrying
a load of smuggled goods when seen by
Hclllngshead. The latter ordered him to
halt, but he endeavored to escape In the
.darkness. Holllngshead sent a bullet af
ter him, and Narciso fell dead. : A coron
er's jury in Nogales found that Holllngs
head had killed the smuggler while in
the discharge of his duty. Â«
Narciso had always managed to outwit
the custom house officers and always said
he never would be taken alive. At one
time Line Rider Hathaway,: now dead,
lay in wait for him on a hidden trail In
the Nog-ales mountains. ~When Narciso
came along bullets flew thick and fast,
but the smuggler succeeded in escaping.
The Nogales custom house officials felt
relieved on hearing the fate of the smug
gler who had-bothered them for years.

BOTH . Chimmie Whalen and little
Hudson. pitched great ball yesterday
at the Eighth street battle ground.
Chimmie beat the wee .one at the
finish with 1 to 0 posted on the boards.
It was anybody's game until Dunleavy
sent any easy grounder to Cap Shugart
in the last half of the final splurge. Er
rors counted for naught. The whole
game depended on the man who does
winding stunts with his bread winning
arm, and Chimmie was the man. ''hi'.
The Â¦ came was full of what is known-!
as ginger. In fact there was a â¢triflle too
much of the spicy article.' for it cost Mr.
Bill Devereaux a five spot- and also: was
instrumental in having him sent to the
bench in the seventh. . Bill was at the
bat and tried to pass out one of his lat
est college yells at McDonald. It. seem-,
ed to remind Jim of how he' used to
whoop when his teacher landed on him
with the rattan, so he cried "Five."
Bill tried to square it by handing the dig
nified official another package, but this
time he was sent to the pines. â¢ '
Hits and runs were scarce. They
never came in bunches. Nordyke enjoyed
the' distinction of being the only gent to
trip the paths to the plate. In round
four he walked, Shugart sacrificed and
Holly singled to right, bringing Dyke in
and winning for Uncle Henry.
Oakland really scored m tne first, but
Whalen cleverly blocked Mohler at third
when McCreedie hit a long fly to right,
which the tiny man could easily have
come in on. Dunleavy has resorted to
this trick in the last two games, and Hol
ly worked it yesterday, so the case is just
about squared. â¢ ' :Â«-Â¦'&
Holly's hand is badly hurt and he
chased the ball in right, while Glendoh
ran over shortstop's territory. He show
ed up like an old timer with the excep
tion of one trifling error. .McCreedie
tcok Brick's place at short and. made no
mistakes. Mobler made the sensational
play of the day in the first when he rose
in the air and with one mitt took a liner
from McHale's bat which looked good for
twp bags. The score:

at the Olympic Club last night.
There were only six delegates .present,
but they managed to transact matters of
Interest to amateurs.
After some discussion the Lincoln Ath
letic Club was made a member of the as
sociation. President Winterbottom of the
i.ew organization stated to the delegates
that the club numbered 164 members. The
525 fine imposed on the Ariel Rowing Club
for disregarding the rules and allowing
an unregistered amateur to box at one, of
its exhibitions was reduced to $3.
Albert P. Kothkopf , a member of the
Fourth of July regatta committee, re
ported that this year's event would bring
cut more oarsmen than, in former years,
and he believed the regatta would be a
great success.
Timothy I. Fitzpatrick was appointed
coxing commissioner. His duties are to
promote clean sport among amateur box
ers. The Pacific Athletic Club was sus
pended from the association for non-at
tendance and non-payment of dues.
Upon motion of Delegate Cadogan of
the Reliance Athletic Club the association
adopted the rule that'if an amateur wno
signs to box before a bona-fide club fails
to keep his engagement he will be sus
pended unless he can show that his fail
ure was due to illness. .
The regatta committee was authorized
to expend the sum of 525 for printing and
other necessities.
At the conclusion* of the regular meet
ing the committee appointed to look af
ter the Fourth of July regatta was called
to order. Chairman Hinchman reported
that accommodations would be furnished
the men who will participate in the con
tests at Lake Merritt. Twenty dollars was
voted the Stockton Athletic Club to pay
the expenses of the oarsmen who will
uphold the GlutTs colors at the coming re
gatta.
The. senior and junior skiff prizes were
reduced in order that a $35 prize' may bs
awarded the winner of the shell race.
This was done because the shell men own
their own boats.
Entries close for the regatta on the
evening of June 30th.

.Kid Williams and Youns Glbbs.
In his last ring battle, which. was with

The dispatch from Stockton to the effect
that George Lavigne had. lost his reason
came aÂ» a shock to his host of friends in
this city. The one-time lightweight cham

Thursday and beyond the fact that ho
seemed preoccupied there was. nothing to

Contend is the dark horse of the race.
After breaking the record for one and
an eighth miles at Gravesend, he has not
been heard from as to work for thfe Su
burban. His tremendous speed is unques
tioned, but his ability to go a mile and a
quarter in fast company is seriously
questioned.
With the field as it stands to-night a
magnificent struggle is assured. Blues
will have little chance of meeting the in
terference his backers dread.. Still, they
are small in number compared to what
Jthey were before Gold Heels on.his first
appearance - this season after an equally
rough trip exhibited decided superiority
over Blues.- Gold Heels is the most fav
ored as a possible winner, but those who
have heard*. John Madden' s opinion of
Pentecost -give Gold Heels no chance' to
defeat the three-y.ear-old. Pentecost
works with Colonel Bill, another of Mad
den's .wonders. Pentecost, it is said, runs
away from Colonel Bill at any time and
any distance, and Colonel Bill defeated
Gold Heels in adecisive style. But there
are others who pin their faith to Ad
vance Guard. He is the sort of horse
turf followers come to love. He is always
doing his best; always "coming on" when
the winning post is near. He will prob
ably be the post favorite.
' Mud is likely to be the; footing over"
which the battle will be fought. - There
were showers Â£ at Sheepshead Bay to
night, with promise' of more rain. Under
the soaking of Wednesday the track of
the Coney Island Jockey Club became
stiff and hard with a. top of lumpy mud.
Yesterday it was lightning fast. A little
rain would improve it but heavy showers
will make it sfippery going. This will
decrease the chances of long-striding,
horses like Advance Guard and Blues.

vorcees under any dispensation. There

CONDEMNED HOUSE â Subscriber,
City. This correspondent asks: Is a
person compelled to pay rent while living
in a house on property which has been

as propounded is that If a party occupies
the house after condemnation of property
he Is bound to, pay rent. If the hause
suited 5 his purposes before condemnation
he would have to pay rent, and if after
the condemnation, the Â¦ premises still suit
him he is in duty bound to pay the rent.
If he does not desire to - remain Â¦ in the
premises he. may. move, as he cannot be
compelled to "remain there.

ONLY the early fruit is ripe and going forward
to market, and the enormous crop to follow
is still growing, when a cry .goes up all over
the State that the\jabor is not here to do the harvest
ing and marketing. .
It is the opinion of experienced fruit-growers and
handlers that half of this fine crop will rot on the
ground for lack of labor to secure and save it. This
will mean a loss to the State of about $10,000,000, too
much to lose in one season from such a cause. At the
same time that lack of labor in that field appears
there is also a dearth of household help, especially
on ranches, which adds to : the burdens of rural life.
For most of this there are certain economic rea
sons that should be understood. : The fact is that our
whole fruit 'industry in this State was founded on
Chinese labor. It requires a mobile form of labor
that, can move readily from orchard to orchard and
be available in any. part of the State on time, for
ripening fruit does not wait for anything. A sort of
skill, which the Chinese were found to readily ac
quire, 13 ... necessary in all orchard operations.'
Coupled with these characteristics * fidelity 'to con
'tract is a prime necessity in handling fruit, and this is
"one of the qualities possessed by Chinese to a greater
degree than by any other people. . These made Chi
nese the orchard and vineyard labor of tlie State, not
on account of its cheapness, but because of its ability
and its reliability.. As the experienced fruit hands get
older and exclusion has prevented the addition of
others, the quality of cheapness has disappeared, and
experienced fruit-growers would pay more for Chi
nese than other labor if they could get it, but they
cannot, j ' , , Â¦
This;year is to test the matter. The railroads and
immigrant agencies are straining every nerve to sup
ply the State with labor enough to save the fruit crop.
All parties concerned look on with interest curious to
seeif'white and Japanese labor, can fill the gap. ' -

PREMIER COMBES and his new Cabinet have
submitted their programme to the Chamber of
Deputies and have received a vote of confi
dence by the impressive majority of 329 to 124. This
is a striking proof of the excellent work' accomplished
by. the â¢ retiring Cabinet, headed by Waldeck-
Rousseau. France has had a Government with which
a large majority of her people were satisfied. It is
from that satisfaction the present feeling of harmony
and confidence comes. Combes has succeeded to a
strong political heritage from his predecessor.' It
remains to be seen what he will do with it. \"- )} *'
The new Ministry is said to be much more radical
than that which has just closed its career, but
nevertheless it takes office pledged to continue the
former policy. Of course the pledge cannot be fully
kept. New. men mean new ideas, even when they un
dertake to maintain old measures. . We have an
illustration of that fact in our own Government.
President Roosevelt has no doubt sincerely under
taken to carry out the policy of McKinley, but he is
not McKinley, and already his. Cabinet has under
gone several changes and the relations between the
administration and Congress are not what they were.
The personal factor counts in government as in
everything else, and with a change of leaders there
inevitably comes a change in the whole situation. .
It is a safe prediction that the large majority that
gave the vote of confidence to the Combes Ministry
on Thursday will not long remain undiminished. The
very terms in which the confidence was expressed are
ominous of division and discord as soon as the Min
isters undertake to put their policy into practice.
The resolution declares: "The Chamber expresses
its confidence in' the Government to. apply the policy
of laicism, fiscal reform and social solidarity."' Now
laicism means further separation of church and state,
fiscal reform means to some people a graduated in
come tax, and 'social solidarity means almost any
thing the socialists may take a notion . to demand.
There can be no agreement among; the\ majority of
the Chamber upon plans for carrying out such a pro
gramme, and sooner or later among some o^them.the
feeling of confidence will give way to antagonism.
A summary of the programme outlined by the
Ministry states that the principal measures to '.' be
brought forward at once are the reduction of military
service to two years, the repeal of the Fallpux law,
which favors religious orders engaged in teaching,
the establishment of an income tax, the thorough
execution of thelaw regulating associations, and bills
providing for, fiscal reform; financial economy, and the
state : purchase of railroads.
; In. the debate in the* Chamber upon the programme
M. Brussiere,; speaking for.the Radicals,- urged the
Government to carry out; an extreme programme in
dealing with the church, so as to bring : abo*ut an en-

- â1 NTOMOLOGISTS are still much in the dark
Â¦H about the grasshopper invasions which occur
- â^ from time to time and disappear, with as little
known cause as their coming had.
The grasshopper is always with us as a rather
harmless and lively insect, related to the cricket,
which chirps at harvest-time and was a necessary
feature on the old-time hearth. Just why, at certain
periods irregular in recurrence, this insect comes in
myriads, with the appetite of a hog, and eats every
green thing, is not yet known. It is the locust of the
East, and in Northern Africa and elsewhere is used
as food for the people.
The name locust is mistakenly applied to a Very
different insect, the Cicada septendecem, which ap
pears in fixed localities at periods of seventeen years.
It is not a hopper, but is a sluggish and slow-flying
creature, with, a rude imitation of the letter W on
its wings and a monotonous cry of "faroe," with a
prolongation of the last syllable. It is comparatively
harmless. The female deposits her eggs with an ovi
positor in the bark of trees, making a series of inci
sions for that purpose in regular rows running
lengthwise of the limb. Sometimes the smaller limbs
of fruit trees break as a result of these incisions,
which penetrate the sap, but the harm done is
very slight. These insects exist in families, or
broods, in widely separated localities. They are not
migratory. The eggs hatch and the young go into
the ground and remain there seventeen years going
through the changes of insect life and emerging at
the end of the period to frighten the superstitious,
who think that the W on their wings is a prophecy of
war, and that their cry is the name of the Egyptian
King of the Exodus, and that these were the fabu
lous insects that were sent to be a burden to the
people of the Nile.
The different families xio not all come at once, but
each has its own seventeen years period. This regu
lar and orderly recurrence eminently distinguishes
them from the true locust or grasshopper, which is a
creature of irregular habits. Just now this insect is
.prevalent in small areas in : the foothills of the
Sierras, in Fresno, Sacramento and Placer counties,
and the people are much alarmed. Their voracity is
amazing. At first wingless they crawl on the ground
and eat every green thing, their progress being about
loo yards in twenty-four hours. They strip vineyards
bare, and if an orchard be in their line of march they
gorge the leaves and the young fruit and leave it as
bare as if it had never borne fruit or foliage.
In the wingless stage they are exterminable by
using fire, or by poisoning some food that they will
eat and putting it in their way, or by putting coal oil
in troughs or ditches across which they must crawl.
For several years they devastated nearly all of Kan
sas and Nebraska and a wide strip of Western Iowa,
reducing land-owners to insolvency and distress.
During those successive sieges many devices were
brought against them and some were effective, but
just what they were is forgotten, for the plague has
long disappeared from that part of the country, and
when it comes again, as it no doubt will, in
genuity and invention will be called on to create
means for resisting it. Perhaps the entomologists
will be able to 'protect the country by finding some
way of knowing, when the insects are in the ground
in dangerous numbers and dealing with them in that
stage of their existence.
At present man is comparatively powerless in the'
presence of this small enemy, which lays waste his
fields and devours his substance in spite of all his
knowledge and his strength.
The present visitation in this " State does not
threaten an extensive district, and as soon as the in
sects get wings they may rise and fly to the moun-
In the grasshopper" years . in Kansas the flight of
the insects would continue for days, and their num
ber was so countless that they -appeared like a cloud
and obscured the sun. Since they were a burden to
Egypt they probably have never appeared in such
force as in the years when it was said they ate every
thing in those States but the rail fences.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
SUMMER has, barely begun and yet in the: East
the attention of the public has-been recalled to
tlie^ subject of -forest preservation by the re
currence of forest* fires. . One of our Eastern ex
changes says that u during the month of May "de
structive fires have broken out in Pennsylvania, Ken
tucky, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, New. York,
Connecticut, Minnesota, Colorado, Maine, Texas,
New Hampshire, Iowa, New Mexico, North Caro
lina and Ohio." Â«
That ,is a tremendous record for a single month of
springtime and gives a portentous warning of what
is to come with the" summer. Incidentally it shows
how swiftly the hot sun dries the forests of the East
when once the snows are melted and the spring
storms are over.' We in California do not look- for
extensive forest fires in May. That, however, is an
other story. The iWue now is not one of climate in
spring. or summer, but one of protecting our woods
against the ravages of fire. We in bur turn and our
season shall have fires enough to impress us â¢ with
the lesson the East is now studying, and no section
of the State will escape.
Over and over again the question of preserving
our forests and conserving our water supply has been
discussed. An. elaborate campaign of education has
been carried on, and it is not .likely that any con
siderable number of intelligent; -;. people ' have any
longer a doubt of the urgent need of; adopting some
plan of guarding against fires/and Mother causes '."of
woodland "waste: To agree thafc>action-^$f needed and
to take action, however, are two different a things.'
Californians have long been agreed' on the subject,
but no comprehensive programme of ' action has yet
been take/i or even scientifically formulated. 'V
It is'tUiie to get to work at this problem in- ear
nest. *Pliis fall' a new' Legislature is to. be elected,
and next winter it wilLmeet. The time is propitious,
therefore, to a thorough consideration of the forest
problem, so that there may be elected to the Legis
lature men who will undertake to devise ways and
means for solving the problem. *}'-â¢
In several of the Eastern States a great deal has
been done in the way of experimenting in forestry,
and the general Government also has done much.
California, therefore, will not have to act as a pioneer
in the matter, though of course as our problems are
radically different in many respects from those of the
East we shall have to work out our own salvation in
many ways. Be that as it may, it is time to get at
it. The springtime fires in the East are warnings of
what we are going to have in the fall. There is no
use waiting until the fire flashes in our eyes and the
smoke is in our nostrils before we begin to think
about the issue. : It should be taken up as a part of
the non-partisan State politics of the year, and leg
islative candidates of all parties should be pledged to
accomplish something next winter for the preserva
tion of our forests and the conservation of bur
waters. â¢ Â¦ . .
FOREST PRESERVATION
The charge is made that since the death of Glad
stone the Liberal party in Great Britain has sunk
from "imperial liberalism' to provincial radicalism";
and something of the same kind of decline, has taken
place in the Democratic party in this country. It
has no longer a jiationaUpolicy on any issue, and in
the coming elections every district will have a local
buncombe platform of its own.

"The King's Race Horses" is now near
ly ready for publication. Judging by the
specimen of the cover In which It will be
bound it will make a very beautiful and
most sumptuous volume. The royal
quarto edition will be 3 guineas and the
imperial size 10 guineas. It gives a full
account of King Edward's connection'
with the national sport.
Lord Marcus B<*esfordt who contributes
some notes, in as extra, equerry to the
King. Edward Spencer, who writes the
general narrative, is a well-known'sports
man and authority on sporting matters.
In the first chapter Spencer deals with
royalty on the turf from Henry II down
ward.
The fourth chapter Is specially interest
ing to lovers of the turf. It describes the
scene on Epsom Downs when Persimmon
won for the Prince of Wales, as he then
was, his first Derby, to be followed by the
Ascot cup, the Eclipse stakes, the Don
caster, St. Leger and the Jockey Club
stakes by this famous horse; the winning
of the One Thousand Guineas-by Thais,
the Manchester cup by Florlzel and the
Two Thousand Guineas and the St. Leger
by Diamond Jubilee. The fifth chapter
treats of the Grand National Steeplechase
won by Ambush, with other performances
by. the same racer. The last chapter de
scribes Sandringham, with its natural ad
vantages for breeding blooded stock. The
volume Is to contain twenty plates in "
photogravure.
Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, I have

ford him time to revise his book on Per

Lady Warwick in Kvf!Lstentl7 recovered
from her recent humlr.iz accident to be
able to work on the book which Â«he has
long had in view. This lx the history of
Warwick Castle from the earliest times
to the end of Victoria.'* reign. With the
story of the castle famous In English his
tory there will be linked the story of it3
owners, who alao have played a part in
English history. .The collection o? family
papers at Warwick Castle Is very fu'.l
and the information they contain will be
the basis of the book. It will be finely
illustrated. In part from old paintings, and
will be published in two volumes by
Messrs. Hutchinson during the. autumn. Â¦
The last month has. according to the
publishers' reports, developed little or no
Improvement over the preceding month in
the amount of business done. The de
mand In nearly every class of literature
has been, with few exceptions, very lim
ited, although judging from the orders
which come from the various provincial
centers" it would appear that the slack
ness in the country is not so pronounced
as in London. With the coronation fes
tivities In view, anticipations of any im
mediate change are not high, though with
the war now over publishers talk hope
fully of a bright autumn. The great dan
ger, however, will be of the glutting of
the market with so many good books of
fiction which have been held up for more
than a year, waiting for more prosperous
times. There has been no great sale even,
of what are recognized as good books.
"A Way of Escape," by Graham Travers;
"At. Sunwich Port," by Jacobs, and
"Scarlet and Hyssop" haveÂ» continued in
almost constant request, but even these
have not had anything like success. Less
meritorious works have had more pros
perous times, strange as it may seem.
The fourth and concluding volume, of
the "Dictionary of the Bible," edited by
Dr. Hastings, which Is not yet out, but
will be published within the next 'Â¦ few
days," has led to an enormous demand for
the previous three volumes. â¢ No work of
a kindred nature has ever attained such
popularity. The demand has been almost
four times the amount indicated by the
early subscriptions. Another edition will
have -to be printed before the orders can.
be met.
If fiction and other work3 are suffering
just now the Bible Is finding . a great
many purchasers. It is not that any re
ligious wave is flowing over the nation,
but the Bible is undoubtedly the best
selling book at the present moment, to
gether with the coronation prayer book,
which was mentioned last week. There
is a very keen demand for the special
coronation editions of the Holy Scriptures
which have been issued. I have been try
ing to arrive at an estimate of how many
Bibles are sold in England In the course
of the year, but the nearest figure I can
get is from, one theological publisher,
who, while unable to give statistics, cal
culates that at least four million copies
must be disposed of by different publish
ers every twelve months. "But all
these," he remarked, "are not read in En
gland by any means. A great many go
to America, the colonies and other coun
tries."

The petition of the United Railroads
Company of San Francisco for a' street
railroad franchise on Bay and Buchanan
streets came up yesterday morning be
fore the Street Committee, of the Super
visors, composed of Peter J. Curtis, John
Connor and Samuel Braunhart.
Supervisor Braunhart stated that he
vas in favor of granting the franchise,
provided that the United Railroads of
San Francisco would in turn grant to the
city and county the right to use Market
street for thelproposed municipal Geary
street road, without Questioning the right
of the city to use the street.
Joseph S. Tobin replied that the United
Railroads Company was particularly, de
sirous of obtaining the franchise for five
blocks on Bay and Buchanan streets in
order to reach the power house for the
purpose of housing the men and cars, and
of obtaining additional power.
Regarding the other 'franchises* M^.
Tobin said . the company submitted that
the same should be granted subject to
reasonable conditions.
Supervisor Connor said that if the rail
way, company would grant the use of the
Sutter Street Railway Company's rails
on Market street he would vote in itavor
of the franchise on Bay and Buchanan
streets.
â¢ J. S. Tobin said the privilege is worth
millions. of dollars and the "United Rail
roads Company ha's an exclusive right to
operate on Market street, and that if a
concession is made in this respect it will
impair, the validity of the franchise and
would be unjust to the .company's stock
and bond holders. Continuing, Mr. Tobin
said: y. .
"I have consulted with our directors
and we do not think we can make this
concession in justice to our stockholders.
"If the Bay street franchise is not
granted we must build our power house
along the line of the present roads."
Charles "W. Reed asked that the matter
be laid over for one week in order to
offer certain conditfons in the proposal,
and it was. so ordered. . '
Applications for franchises for the Cal
ifornia Street Railroad Company and
Presidio and Ferries Railroad Company
also went over for one week.
The committee was in favor of the
pas-sage of the ordinance submitted by
the Commercial Pacific Cable Company
to lay an underground conduit for a
trans-Pacific cable, and it will come up
for passage next Monday.
THE discussion of a Pacific cable in the House
brought out a. great- variety of opinions. Mr.
Dalzell* declared himself opposedio" a Govern
ment cable and also opposed to Mr. Mackay's propo
sition to lay. one. The va4ue of his contribution to
the debate may be judged by his peroration, in which
he said: ; "I want an* American cable, built by Ameri
can capital, in American workshops, by American
wage-earners, laid by American ships, under the
American flag."
When other: people' talk that way in opposition to
our manufactures Mr. Dalzell and his colleagues , on
the Ways and Means Committee get quite warm
about it Nor is he always consistent in his reiterated
and reaffirmed Americanism, or he would stand by
the rights of American farmers against the] Cuban
He opposes the Mackay cable . because he says it
will be built in England. - The fact is that no ocean
cable can be built without going to England for the
material. She owns and controls the only insulating
material that is known. Only gutta percha will insu
late and protect an ocean cable. England controls
the gutta percha suppiy of the world, and the ma
terial is worth $6 per pound. This is the reason that
England has a monopoly in the manufacture of
cables.
If Mr. Dalzell will look a little further into the sub
ject he will find that one.of the greatest sources of
supply of gutta percha is in the Mahometan islands
of the Philippine- archipelago, which we are supposed
to own.. Their gutta percha, copal gum and other
natural products' of highly concentrated value find a
market in Singapore and: go to London. When
Americans have desired to locate on .Mindanao for
commercial purposes, having been invited there by
the Mahometan. Dattos and Sultan, the American
Congress, including Mr. Dalzell, has refused them the
right, and they 'have been made the objects of public
suspicion and political abuse. The English traders,
however, circulate freely among our Mahometan sub
jects, enjoy their confidence and respect and get their
trade. Instead of traders Mr. Dalzell aids in sending
there the troops, trained in destruction by making
Samar a howling wilderness, to slaughter hundreds of
Moros without adequate cause and make all Ameri
cans the objects of hatred and suspicion. For all
this England is very much obliged, and can afford to
smile on Mr.- Dalzell's intense Americanism which
proposes to prevent the laying of any cable until it is
insulated by the star-spangled banner, while he makes
it forever impossible to lay an American-built cable
by preventing American .control of an article with
out which no cable can be' laid.
So. far, ; thanks to that kind of Americanism, we
have air the expense and all the hatred in the Philip
pines and England, is getting the most important part
of the trade and control of such commercial special
ties as gutta percha and copal gum.
Mr. Corliss, author of the Corliss bill for a Gov
ernment cable, followed Mr. Dalzell in the same
strain, except that , he wants a cable manufactured,
laid, owned and operated by the Government. If
his bill pass the Government cannot have a cable
builfin this country without robbing the taxpayers,
on the reason that the Government cannot get the
material. If that fact become known, and the
knowledge carry with it the further fact that Ameri
can merchants and traders, if allowed to do so, will
make an industrial conquest of the Philippines, which
will slay no people, create no howling' wilderness,
cost the taxpayers nothing and leave no loathing and
hatred in the .breasts of the people, and at the same
time. give us control of gutta percha and the ability
to make an American cable, the discussion will not
have been in vain.

SATISFACTORY REPORT
ON FLORAI, EXHIBITION
Contractor Porter, who had charge of
the repairing of the cable connecting Ju
neau. with Skagway, performed his work
successfully and on June 9 the first mes
sages between the two points were trans
mitted.' .
The low water In the Yukon is still giv
ing the river steamers - a great . deal of
trouble. At times the water rises under
the influence of the warm sun, but a fall
in temperature sends it down again.
â¢ When the Dawson passengers of the
Princess May left the Klondike metrop
olis five cases of smallpox had broken out
among the passengers of the steamer
White .Horse and it seemed likely that
there would be a somewhat lengthy de
tention of that vessel and her passengers
and. crew. Those on . board the White
Horse when she was quarantined and the
vessel itself were detained at Dog Island,
below Dawson. . ..
It is. the opinion of th"e Canadian cus
toms officers at Caribou that much gold
dust is surreptitiously being run down the
Yukon to St. Michael. Such pold, of
course, does not pay the royalty now in
force and therefore .will never be classed
with the output of the Yukon district.
' VANVOUVER, B. C, June 13.â What
may practically be termed the first gold
to arrive from the Klondike this season
was brought here to-day on the steamer
Princess May. Approximately $150,000 in
dust came on the vessel. About $70,000
came down on the City of Seattle. Ac
curate news of the clean-up is difficult
to obtain, as claim owners keep the re
sults very quiet. Â¦ Â¦Â¦

Milton V. Brown has been filed. It shows
a separation -.was granted on statutory
grounds, the co-respondent being a Los

ed alimony, counsel fees and a right to
resume her former name. Evidence
showed that the relations between the
couple had been of the most amicable
nature until the cause of suit occurred,
which was but a few days before the
complaint was filed. There had not been
any desertion of the plaintiff on the part
of the defendant.

SALEM, Ore., June 13.Â«â Governor Geer
land Superintendent Lee of the peniten
tiary to-night offered a reward of $3000 for
the capture and return, dead or alive, of
Tracy and Merrill, the escaped convicts.
This is double the amount offered here
tofore.
The officers believe it is more than likely
that they will come eventually to Port
land. At all events, they are further than
ever away from capture and the only hope
the Sheriffs have of rinding them is in re
ports that come in from along their route
when they become hungry and seek food
at a farmhouse. Through the densely
matted bushes that fill every bottom and
swale and in the fir forests a little further
up the range they could move for days
without attracting notice.
Sheriff Durbin and his forces hit the
trail of the convicts early this morning In
the bottom below Graves. The dogs pro
ceeded rapidly for a time and then lost
the scent, which was cold. Once more E.
M. Carson, who has charge of them,
pushed through the brush and urged the
hounds "on, and once more they found the
trail, but the convicts had evidently back
tracked and presently the dogs, complete
ly baffled, gave it up, and that was the
last trace of the convicts.
Where the convicts are now no one
knows. They may be walking calmly
along some mountain road in Clackamas
County, headed for the mountains, or they
may be working their way toward Port
land. They have five pounds of bacon,
sufficient to enable them to travel several
days without disclosing their whereabouts
by applying for food at ranches, and they
are undoubtedly rested by this time from
the strain of the first flight ahead of the
hounds.
PORTLAND. Or., June 13,â The hunt for
Tracy and Merrill, the escaped convicts,
has been abandoned by Sheriffs Durbin
and Cook and the State troops have been
sent home. Governor Geer has doubled
the reward for the capture of the fugi
tives, dead or alive, making It now $3000,
which may lead some one to take up the
chase again. Both Sheriffs will hold them
selves In readiness to proceed in the di
rection of any authentic report of the
whereabouts of the two outlaws, but until
such information comes, it is believed, it
will be just as well to wait at home and
allow the fagged out men and dogs to
take thfe rest which has been denied them
for the past five days.
Charles Ferrell of Reno, Nev., a brother
of Guard Frank Ferrell, who was mur
dered by Tracy and Merrill, has arrived
here and declares that he will alone take
up the trail of the fugitives and endeavor
to run them down.

RAY HAWLET, aged 9 years, who
lives with his parents at 440 Chen

bravery of four firemen, members
of the local department. He fell
into the Spring: Valley Water Company's
reservoir, which is located at West ave
nue and Holly Park, and would have
drowned had not Captain Eugene O'Con
nor, Lieutenant George Styles, Engineer
W. S. Casebolt and Hoseman Thomas
Connors plunged Into the cold waters and
savgl him. The rescue was a thrill
ing one. The four men, whose duty
it is to save property and lives at fires,
plunged into .the water with as much
nerve as they would display at the big
gest conflagration.
Lieutenant Styles was the only swim
mer in the quartet, but this did not
stop the others from plunging Into the
reservoir, which is 25 feet deep by actual
measurement. The deed the four per
formed yesterday is equally as notable as
those performed by heroes who have been
awarded the Scannell Medal. They took
their lives In their hands. Their I only
thoughtywas to save a life, and having
succeeded in their task, they feel they
have been amply rewarded.

Without a moment's hesitation the four
brave men vaulted the high fence and
rushed through the grounds. They saw
the lad struggling in the water and re

to where he fell in they could only see
his fingers wriggling in the water.

V/UJLlgt/U. J.U.
How. often these significant words are spoken in our great mills,
shops, and factories by the poor, girl who has worked herself to the
point whe're nature can endure no more and demands a rest! The poor
sufferer, broken in health must stand aside and make room for another.
Â¦' The foreman says, "If you are not well enough to work you must
leave, for we must put some one in your place."
Standing all day, week in and week out, or sitting in cramped posi-
tions, the poor girl has slowly contracted some deranged condition of
her organic system, which calls a halt in her progress and demands
restoration to health before she can be of use to nerself or any one else.
To this class of women and giris Mrs. Pinkham proffers both sym-
pathy and aid.; When these distressing weaknesses and derangements
assail- you,t remember that there is a remedy for them all. We have on
record thousands of such cases that have been absolutely and penna- S
nently cured byXydla E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, restoring
to vigorous health and lives of usefulness those who have been pre- :

â¢ It is alleged that on June 11 Henry
called upon Rosa and induced him to part

receive a high rate of interest. Rosa was
handed a receipt, as he supposed, for the

a demand upon Henry for the return of
the money, but it was refused, . hence the
warrant.

THE delegates to the Grand Parlor

they should not grant the members of
Minerva Parlor a hearing on their objec
tions to the issuance cf a charter to Gen

alternative writ of mandamus yesterday,
directing the appearance in court of tha
grand president of the order and the fair
delegates. An exciting time is expected.
as the Daughters have been waging bit
ter warfare ever since Mrs. G. 'W. Baker
favored the organization of Genevieve
Parlor.
â¢ It is claimed that Genevieve Parlor was
instituted arbitrarily by Mrs. Baker after
the members of Minerva Parlor had
"black balled" the fair ones who were
enxious to secure the organization of a
new parlor. Â¦.
A suit for an injunction restraining Mrs.
Baker from granting Genevieve Parlor a
charter was heard by Judge Murasky sev
eral months ago, but* the injunction was
refused, the court holding that it was a
matter for the Grand Parlor to pass judg
ment upon, and not a case to be decided
in a court of equity.
This is the first time the order has taken
a, step in this direction and -every effort
will be made to make the initiation the
greatest the Foresters of America in this
city has ever known.
The courts taking part will receive all
candidates their members secure and they
will also be permitted to retain the full
initiation fee in each case.
The meeting was addressed by Grand
Chief Ranger Wolfe, who spoke encourag
ingly of the work in hand. He offered
valuable suggestions in the line of how
the project should be carried out. '
For the purpose of carrying into 'effect
the provisions of the plan the executive
council of the â¢ Grand Court will appro
priate a I sum of money sufficient to de
fray the , expenses and the balance will
be met by contributions from the various
courts. i-,~ -
A grand ball 'will be given.. the night
following the initiation -in" Eintracht Hall
in honor of the new members* Their, fam
ilies and the relatives of members now
in the order will be invited. , :
Syl Shaben,' grand marshal,' presented a
plan for a night parade to precede the in
itiation in Eintracht Hall,, on -Twelfth
street. He stated .that he expected be
tween 1500 and 2000. Foresters in line. He
will divide them into. five sections, each
under charge of a division- marshal and
aids. Â» The first -division is to be made up
of â¢ courts from the interior and to be fol
lowed by the local courts in numerical
order, with four bands of music, red fire
and fireworks. ... â¢ ~* .:
The chairman appointed a committee of
twelve to visit courts here and across the
bay for the purpose of arousing the en
thusiasm of the â¢members. . ' - â¢
...Arrangements were naade for the man
ner of initiating Â¦ the large class of can
didates and. giving them the degfee and

There was a well-attended meeting last
night In the Alcazar building of the gen
eral committee that is arranging for the
monster initiation that the Foresters of
America proposes to hold in this city-Au

.. "I do not," was the reply:
"Well, iron up your clothes ; and be on
Oeck at 7:30," Cornyn said, then left the
cell. - â¢
Â¦ Shortly after 7 o'clock last night Rev.
I. A. B. Wilson came to the Jail with a
certificate and soon after Miss Annie
Belle Nihill and her sister. Miss Kate
Nihill, arrived. The party seated them
selves in the superintendent's office and
Tiarker was brought from his cell attired
in a Prince Albert coat and a white neck-
Me and carrying a miniature warship,. the
work of his own hands. There were but
few spectators present. The attaches of
the' jail stood in one corner an* several
trusties watched intently from a stair
way in the hall. Little time was lost.
Kate Nihill and Superintendent Cornyn
signed as witnesses and after kissing his
sweetheart Barker arose, holding her by
the hand and walked to where Rev. Mr.
Wilson was standing.
The ceremony over the minister added
a little prayer.' It was that God would
lea a the couple out of their present difft
culvies and grant them srace to lead a
life of righteousness. Then the self-In
vited guests pressed forward, offering,
congratulations and afterward withdrew.'
Barker, his wife and Miss Nihill re
mained in the superintendent's room for
an hour, at the end of which the ladies
arose to leave. Then Barker presented
his wife with the miniature battleship he
had carried from his cell. It was made of
tinsel and colored flakd and was the only
wedding gift. . The woman carried It
away with her and as . she passed out of
the "door the threw a ktes back to her
husband, who was being led â¢ by on the
way to. his cell.
Thomas A. \ Barker, charged .with burg
lary, and .Annie Belle Nihill/ , who was
found. with him in a nest of robbers, re
cently raided by the police , on : Natoma
street, were made hu3band and wife be
hind the iron doors of the, Broadway jail
last night. The wedding was one of the in
cidents of prison life. After the "solemn,
binding words", had been spoken the new
ly made vife spent a short. time In con
versation with her^husband, then left. the
jail to enjoy freedom, while he passed
back along the gloomy corridor and Into
his dingy cell to N await trial on a serious
charge that may send him to the peni
tentiary for many years. I
Barker, in company with his wife, her
sister, Joe King, | the "convict" preacher,
and^. James Hamilton, â¢ were captured
about two months ago by. clever detective'
workjon the part ot Oflicer H. P. Braig.
Both "women were released in the police
court, but the men were held on several ,
charges of burglary and sent to the Coun-"
ty Jail. At the. time of the arrest Annie
Nihill ga\"e the name of Mrs. Barker, but
subsequently stated that she had not been
married. The couple then made several
efforts to be wedded, but it was not until
yesterday afternoon that the Sheriff and
'District Attorney gave their consent that
: the ceremony should be performed.
When the new? wag received at the
County Jail Superintendent Frank W.
Cornyn communicated with the groom
to-be. "Do you know that you are to be

James Franklin Wheelock wa3 hanged
here to-day for the murder of Mrs. Emily
Martin. The execution occupied just
twenty-five seconds. Among; the 200 spec
tators were the two sons of the murdered
woman.
The condemned man was led from the
death, cell 'to the gallows a.t 9:30 o'clock.
He ascended trie . steps to the platform
without assistance and on stepping upÂ«m
the trap glanced around at the spectators
below and smiled complacently. Hang
man Arbogast adjusted the noose quickly,
placed the black cap upon the man's head
and ' the trap was sprung within half a
minute of th^e time when Wheelock left
the cell. At 9:37 o'clock the physicians
announced . that the heart pulsations had
ceased.. * ',
â¢ Early this morning, when Wheelock was
dressing for the last time, he requested
that he be allowed to wear a white car
nation on the scaffold. This wish was
granted Z and two snow-white flowers
adorned the lapel of his coat. He ate
heartily and was at no time morose or

Paine's Celery Compound
Bestows That Health and
Vigor That Make Liv-
ing a Pleasure.
- Â¦ Â¦ ' ."
If you are sick and out of sorts In June,
rt is in your power to make yourself
healthy, strong and happy.
.There Is not the slightest reason why
you should go through the hot summer
weather feeling- sickly, miserable. languid
and melancholic. To be. well and strong
means happiness and true Joy, and this is .
the season when you should be bright and
hearty and gladsome.
If you are sleepless, rheumatic, neural-
gic, dyspeptic, or have the shadows of
disease hovering over you; if you are not
as bright, energetic' and strong as you *1
were some weeks ago, the use of Paine's '
Celery Compound will tone up and fortify
your whole system, cleanse the blood,
correct digestion, sharpen the appetite,
and conduce to restful sleep. Thousands
once In a half-dead condition owe their
present good health to the use of Paine's
Celery Compound. Mr. Wm. S. Gibson,
of Pleasureville. Ky., who, through sick-
ness and suffering, was brought near tha
dark grave, writes as follows regarding
his marvelous cure: . Â¦ Â¦-
"I have been broken down in health ancj
strength, nervous system shattered, kid-
neys out of order, had nervous and trem-
bling spells off and on for the last ten
years. I have "taken three bottle's of your
Patae's Celery Compound, and all of the
above-mentioned troubles 1 have left me.
and I can now do a good day's work. 1 go
about my business all day long and it
don't worry me, and I now feel better
than I have in ten years. I have a good
appetite, and can eat and get around on
foot as active as when I was a boy. My
age la 65 years.*

city has reached such alarming propor
tions that the farmers have presented a
petition to the Board of Supervisors ask
ing their assistance in extinguishing the
pest. The grasshoppers have been at work
now for about ten days, and in many
places have done irreparable damage.
Vineyards have been cleaned of every
leaf, orchards rendered absolutely worth
less in half an hour, vegetable gardens
destroyed completely in a few minutes
of time by the millions of locusts.
Those who. have suffered from the dep
redations of the insects say that there are
so many of them that it is almost im
possible for one to breathe where they
are. Professor Woodworth of the Uni
versity of California is here and will meet
Â¦with the Supervisors to talk over means
for exterminating the pest. He says that
he does not believe the county has much
to fear from them, although every pre
caution should be taken.
SACRAMENTO, June 13.â The unculti
vated lands in Placer County, where the
grasshoppers have bred by the million,
are a menace to the orchards and vine
yards of both Sacramento and Placer
counties. Chairman M. J. Dillman of the
Sacramento Board of Supervisors is mak
ing strenuous efforts to bring the Placer
County Supervisors to a realization of the
danger. This morning he communicated
Â¦with some of them, urging that an early
l&eettag of the board be held, with a view
of declaring the burning of pasture lands
a public necessity. Chairman DHlman
also endeavored to get Into communica
tion with Governor Gage to advise him of
the gravity of the situation and urge that
the State take action.
HOMESTEAD AND OLD
ENGLAND NOT TO START
Homestead and Old England are in the
$20,000 Tidal stakes, to be run at Sheeps
head Bay the same day the American
Derby will be decided.
"I decided not to send the colts to Chi
cago," said Mr. Morris, "because I am
afraid the track will be muddy, and they
would take the trip for nothing, as
neither likes the mud. Th*n they fcave
valuable stake engagements at Sheeps
h^ad Bay next week, and I thought it bet
ter to run them here than to take a
Â¦chance by going West."
NEW YORK. June 14.â Green B. Morris
has declared his horses Homestead and
Old England out of the American Derby
to be run at Washington Park. Chicago, a
week from to-day. This announcement
came as a surprise to turfmen generally,
as it had befen expected that at least one
of the horses named would carry the Mor
ris colors in the Western classic.
Seen in. the American
Derby.

OAKLAND, June 13.â For -the
first time in the history of
Oakland there was a general
illumination to-night prelimi
nary to the opening olSthe Elks'
Street Fair and Carnival. The
streets of the city and the City
Hall were strung with electric lights,
much the same as was done in San Fran
cisco during recent celebrations. The
people poured out in thousands and lined
the sidewalks when Grand Marshal George
E. de Golia gave. the order for the street
parade to move. The turnout of the gen
eral public attracted as^much attention as
the parade, for there were fully 23,000
people on the streets.
The parade was a success. The civic
and semi-military societies of Oakland
vied with each other in an effort to do
honor to the city. The National Guard,
Native Sons, Knights of Pythias, Wood
men of the World, Modern Woodmen of
America. League of the Cross Cadets and
various club's and organizations of Oak
land all added their share to the success
of the parade and made it one of the
notable events in the history of this
city.
The various organizations that took
part in the parade made special efforts
to show their interest in Oakland by dec
orating the floats, of which there werÂ«?
many in line. The Native Sons had a
float representing California. The Wood
men of the World and the Modern Wood
men of America made elaborate exhibi
tions, while the Foresters of America,
Retail Clerk*' Association, Knights of
Pythias and Reliance Athletic Club had
spectacular effects.
The San Jose Lodge of Elks sent up a
delegation that was received at the depot
by the members of Oakland lodge. The
San Jose party marched in the parade,
and was afterward given a reception at
the headquarters of Oakland lodge.

Judge Smith readily granted the prose
cuting officer's motion. After receiving
the plea of guilty, his Honor released
O'Brien, suspending sentence for a month,
whicb is only a formal way of tempering
justice with mercy. Arm In arm hus
band and wife departed and a sound of
quiet approval followed as the court
room doors closed behind them.
Â¦ "After a thorough investigation of this
unfortunate case, your Honor, I am sat
isfied that the accused was driven to
crime during a momentary despair tfeat
caused him much mental distress. He has
hitherto borne a good reputation. The re
duction of the charge to that of a mis
demeanor grade would be in the line ot
justice."

Professor Smith's researches were lim
ited to the . collection of Amanites, a
primitive form of the modern Nautilus.
Of these he discovered many new and
valuable specimens. Osmont specialized
Â«_n the collection of the fossil boner, of
the giant Saurians, the gigantic reptiles
of past geological'ages, whose most domi
nant type, the Iguanadon, attained a
length of over thirty feet.
Mr. Osmont left this evening for. a two
months' trip in the fossil regions of
Shasta County. He was accompanied by
Eustace Furlong, an assistant in the geo
logical laboratory at the university.
Great imx'crtance is attached to the
finds of the recent exploring party, owing
lo ihe fact that all ot the fossils repre
sented belong to the middle Triassic
period, a period which has little represen
tation in the geological museums of the
world. It is thought that the ten bcxes
of fossils sent down by Mr. Osmont com
prise a larger representation of the mid
ale Triassic than all of the heretofore dis
covered specimens in America.

with Professor J. P. Smith of the geology
department of Stanford University,- ln-
Ftructor Osmont made a complete explor
ation of portions of what is scientifically
Known as the Humboldt fossil beds, here

When Coffee Left the Troubles Disap-
peared.
It is hard to make people understand
that coffee really will do business for
them if they stick to it long enough. It
is almost a certainty that some little
eymptom of disease, stomach trouble, or
kidney or heart trouble, caused by coffee
drinking, will ultimately develop Into
some fixed organic disease unless the
cause of the disturbance is removed. An
illustration may not be amiss.
A lady in Kearney, Nebr., says: "I used
coffee a great many years. Gradually
my health broke down. I had dyspepsia
and was extremely nervous.- I passed
many sleepless nights, but, like many
others, did not know what was the cause
of my invalidism.
"Finally the trouble centered Into a fat-
ty tumor just over the stomach and in the
region of the heart, causing acute pain in
the stomach and a spasmodic action of
the heart. A surgical operation was
deemc-d necessary, but after all the prep-
arations were made a good, old, honest
doctor suggested that I take treatment
a little longer and leave off coffee and
take Postum and some Grape-Nuts
Breakfast Food.
"I began on Postum and had It made
properly by long boiling and found It
delicious and drank two cups the first
morning. After two weeks I discovered
a marked change for the better. In five
months my supposed tumor had disap-
peared, my headaches were gone and di-
gestion wholly restored. My heart only
gave me trouble a few times. That was
Jive years ago. I have been a steady
â¢user of Postum ever since and am' a new
creature to-day. Am in strong and vigor-
ous health and know exactly how .to ac-
count for It. '
"The ignorance of people on the subject
of coffee is a constant wonder to me, al-
though, at one time, of course, I was Just
as much in the dark as any one could be,
going along year after year putting into
my body the poison that was killing me
and never knowing It." Name given by
Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.

UNITED STATES" WARSHIP. FORMERLY ONE OF MONTEJO'S FLEET,
CAPTURED BY DEWEY AT MANILA. SHE . ARRIVED HERE
DISABLED THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER AN EXCITING VOYAGE.
An old-time statesman, who is familiar
v.ith affairs political in this State, re
marked yesterday: "Gage's re-election is
Impossible. Anybody could defeat him.
The single fact that he took a Chinese
highbinder out of the penitentiary and
hired him to cook in the household of his
Excellency the Governor of California is
sufficient to everlastingly damn him "in
the estimation of the laboring classes.
The working people are already asking:
'Couldn't the Governor find an American
cook, a German cook, a French cook or a
Swedish cook? Why did he employ a
Chinaman and a highbinder? If the Gov
ernor needed a first class cook, why did
he not apply to the Cooks' and Waiters'
Union for white help instead of going to
the penitentiary for a Mongolian?' The
tacts only need to be plainly put forth.
"So other issue is required. What is the
*ense of all this agitation against Chinese
immigration and the employment of Mon
golians when the Governor of the State
himself insults American workingmen by
piving preference to Asiatic labor? Of
tourse all the Democrats are shouting for
Oage and endeavoring to enlist sympathy
for the unfortunate executive. The Dem
ocrats desire -his nomination because any
body could beat him. The absent furni
ture will not count as much against him
as the paroled Chinaman, because the
â¢furniture on parole' . is not earning
wages."
GAGE WILL BE DEFEATED.
The machine forces of San Francisco
are in a bad plight. Burns is said to be
sulking because" Herrin persists in doing
politics with Crimmins. In the south the
Gage men are spreading the report that
the Governor, having fully liquidated all
his political obligations to Burns, proposes
to Â£ive the boss a grand shake. The re
port was placed in circulation before
Gage was overcome by the cloud of San
Quentin scandal. The Gageites are now
hedging and making special overtures to
bring Burns back to the camp. Martin
Kelly, who was betrayed and otherwise
shabbily treated by Herrin. Crimmins.
Burke and Lynch in the last municipal
convention, has had many olive branches
extended to him. Johnny Mackenzie, who
was counted on to stay in town and round
up the Gage push, has gone to the Mon
terey cypress groves. The chief manager
of the business administration, who re
cently exchanged certificates of lnno-.
cence with Warden Aguirre, is in Los An
geles appealing to the Democratic press
for help m obtaining Republican dele
gates to the State convention.
PLIGHT OF THE MACHINE.
From Amador and Calavoras counties
romps tlic news that despite tho urjrient
Sntistonee of iiis friends, Senator John
1\ Davis has persisted in his determina
tion net to become a. candidate for re
election to the State Senate, and a sign
ed statement that he will not be a can
didate vras published in the principal Re
publican papers in those counties yester
day. Senator Davis made a splendid rec
ord as a pood legislator, and displayed
an ability and efliclency of the highest
order. He lias pained a reputation for
unswerving integrity, infinite resourcefui
ners and untiring; energy. Two of his
Senatorial colleagues who were in town
Tvljpn told yesterday of Judge Davis' in
tention expressed keen regret, one of
them stating he would be. missed in the
Senate, and the other that California can
not have too many men as he in
public life.
It is said that A. Ilochcimer of Wil
lows will receive the Republican nomina
tion for State Senator in the Fourth Sen
atorial District. Th*> district, composed
of the counties of Colusa, Glenn. L.ake and
Mendocin-j, is regarded as almost hope
lessly Democratic, but Mr. Hocheimer
will carry the Republican standard if thb
convention places it in his hands.
Word comes from Napa that Percy
King, a young lawyer, will have strong
support for Republican nomination to the
Assembly from the new Fifteenth Dis
Â£,ct. In the last legislature' E. I. Web

demand, the regular buyers being obliged to
stock up, having let their, supplies run low.
As spot stocks are light an advance was the
result. Some operators are inclined to look
for a steadier market from ' now oh; basing
their views on their belief that the crop is not
as large as anticipated, while supplies are less
than a year ago, and the demand for export

NEW YORK, June 13.â R. G. Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade -to-morrow will say:
Oregon Crop Bulletin.
The report of Edward A. Beals, section di
rector of the United States Weather Bureau
for the Oregon Crop Bulletin week ended
June 10 is as follows:
'"Light frosts the early, part of the -week
slightly injured tender , vegetation in many
rectiens. but the rtaple crops eseÂ«>ed un
harmed. All kinds of grain contimie very
promising. Fall wheat is heading nieily with
exery indication of making good, plump ker
nele. The reseeded areas have not yet begun
10 head, but there has been plenty of moisture
rnd the plant is healthy and promising. A
tew complaints of rust and of wheat stalks
falling are made by correspondents In Linn
County. Spring grain Is growing rapidly; It is
well rooted and has an excellent color.' Farly
Â¦*ats, barley and rye are also heading nicely.
â¢'Considerable alfalfa has been cut during
the week in Southern Oregon and the yields
appear to be about the same as last year.
Range grass in the eastern section is the best
:n years, but in Southern Oregan it is not as
pood and some few reports ere to the effect
that feed en the summer ranges is Mill short.
The weather has been too wet and cold for
timothy, and this croD is not as promising as
it -was a few weeks ago. Clover is doing
splendidly. SheÂ»p shearing is nearly completed
and the clip is an average one. It. has been
the best week of the season for gardens, corn,
potatoes, sugar beets and hops, and they are
all making rapid advancement.
"The fruit outlook in Southern and Eastern
Oregon is very promising, but in the Willam
ette Vailed the conditions are so uneven that
it is impossible to arrive at any definite con
clusion as to the probable results, except in the
case of Italian prunes and cherries, both of
<Â£vfcich have been damaged to such an extent
X^.s to cause the yields t be considerably less
:han last year.
considerable show of strength. The activity
was attributed to the same speculative leader
who had been concerned in all recent important
turns and whose return to Wall street this
week gave immediate rise to a show of awak
ening. Whatever the motives of the buying,
the bull leadership secured, a larger foreign
lollowing to-day than at any time this week,
notwithstanding a number of developments not
immediately encouraging to a â¢ rise in prices.
The preliminary figures of the week's currency
movement, which are usually the center of in
terest in a Friday's market, gave no promise
of a strong bank statement. To-day's crop
news was regarded as Unfavorable, owing to
complaints of too much rain in the Southwest.
Part of the strength of wheat was attributed to
an improved demand for export, but this failed
to develop fully. . The figures of the main ex
rx-rta were decidedly unfavorable from those
of May last year. Last week's exports of wheat
and flour show a continuance of the low aver
age, although the moet notable falling off is in
the corn exports. This does not offer encour
agement to the hope of an early supply of for
eign exchange to facilitate remittances for re
payment of foreign obligations. The advance
of a point or over in the Reading stocks was
an important sympathetic Influence on the late
market, but there was no news to show a pros
pect of an sarly settlement of the strike. The
increase in the demand for stock was Incon
testable, nevertheless. In some cases the move
ment was due to individual causes. Sugar ad
vanced on the oversold condition of the market
for the refined product and was affected also by
the Presidential message to Congress rein
forcing thi: recommendation for Cuban recipro
city. There were a number of very large in
dividual buying orders for Mexican Central ex
ecuted In the early market, but the buying
was not followed up. The drop of 8% points
in General Electric was probably due to reports
of a new combination of electrical manufactur
ing companies, backed by Influential capitalists.
The stock afterward rallied 4 points. Chicago
and Eastern Illinois rose 4% points further on
persistent rumors of an offer for control. The
market closed rather quiet, but steady.
There was a large demand for Wabash de
benture B's at an advance of 2% per cent; the
Burlington joint 4s were also In demand. The
rrarket generally was .firm. Total sales, par
value, $3,690,000. Â« l
United States 7s declined % per cent on the
last call. Â¦ â¢ - .

j NEW YORK,; ; June 13. â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: .Labor troubles cloud the im
mediate outlook,' but good crop prospects fairly
well assure future trade. .' The effects of the
anthracite, coal strike are no longer localized.
It affects distributive trade * in a wide, area
and' higher prices- for fuel reduced manu
lactures throughout the East. - Confidence in.
fall trade seemBsto be growing notably, in
manufactured goods is certainly Improving. Â¦

RICHELIEU STOCK IN
SHERIFF'S POSSESSION
Everything Movable Jin Saloon Is
Carted Away to Satisfy an
Attachment.
The row over the possession of the
Richelieu saloon still goes merrily on.
Several of Sheriff Lackmann's deputies
pounced down upon the cafe yesterday
forenoon and with a moving' van they
packed away all the stock and, in fact,
everything movable in, the place. This
was done as a result of the attachmert
placed on the stock of the saloon Thurs
day by Contractor Marks.
Herbert Choynski, who has been in pos
session of the, place for the last few days
refused to raise the attachment and al
lowed the law to take its course. Soon
after the Sheriff's men departed with the
"wet goods" and glassware and other sa
loon fixtures, another big van moved up
to the door and commenced to unload case
after case of liquor until the saloon was
completely restocked. -. -Â¦ . ,
These goods, so Choynski claims, were
simply, consigned to him by - different
wholesale houses and cannot in any way
be attached by people who have claims
against the firm. Whether or not this
contention -will hold good remains to be
seen. :'''.'â -",- .

About three years ago Dr. Wing, while
staying at New Haven, was called upon
by a countryman. This man claimed he
bore letters appointing Dr. Wing to a
high government position if he would re
turn to China. Dr. Wing and the China
man left for China from this city on the
steamer Gaelic. On the arrival of Dr.
.Wing" in China he .was arrested
and charged- with- being a sympa
thizer with the revolutionary movement
to dethrone the Emperor. It is generally
supposed, however, that Dr. Wing was
arrested. at the instance, of Prince Ching,
who" thought that he would pay a big
ransom to â¢ secure Â¦ his freedom. Dr. Wlnjf
was placed in a temple and there terribly
tortured.- He bribed one of his guards to
take a message to an American friend in
Peking. This friend, dressed as a Chi
naman) went to the- temple and at the
pistol point compelled Dr. Wing's guards
to release him. i .
Dr. Wing would: not discuss his arrest,
and to all questions replied that he was
too ill to be Interviewed. He will leave
for the East this week.
Dr. Wing probably is the best known
Chinaman in the United States. He was
admitted to American citizenship in 1852.
He has made great efforts to educate the
better class of Chinese In American ways.
With the assistance of the late Li Hung
Chang, he collected one hundred and thir
ty-five young men from the best families
in China and brought them to this coun
try to be educated, "the Chinese Govern
ment defraying their expenses. He es
tablished for these boys a magnificent
home at Hartford, Conn., and they were
soon deep in study. A new Chinese Em
bassador was appointed to this country
and Dr. Wing acted as his assistant. A
Dr. Wu was sent from China to take care
of the boys, but it is said that he caused
trouble on his arrival. The students went
home, most of them not even waiting to
graduate from any of- the eastern col
leges. v , ~s '
He has been In China for several years,
although he considers Hartford, Conn.,
his home, where he has a handsome res
idence. He says he is here on a private
mission, whether on behalf of the Chinese
Government or not, he refuses to say.
Among the arrivals at s the Occidental
Hotel is Dr. Yung Wins from the Orient.
He has the distinction of being the first
Chinaman to receive a degree from an

ated from" Yale in 1S54.

The city and county suffered a heavy
loss by the' fire. Registrar of Elections
Walsh was on the scene and watched the
destruction of election booths that were
stored in back of the burning building. A
great effort was made tdxsave the lumber
used in building the voting houses, but
the department was only partially suc
cessful. Mr. Walsh is now worried about
the coming primaries, as it will be diffi
cult to~t>uild new booths in the short time
intervening.
CITY | SUFFERS LOSS.
For a time there was a well defined ru
nr.or that Foreman Keyser had lost his
life in the flames. Keyser used to occupy
a room in the building, but fortunate'ly
ho had given it up some months ago. He
made his appearance at the fire during its
progress and every one felt relieved.
Marshal Towe's theory is that the fire
started in the shoddy which was stored
on the second floor on the Folsom street
side, near Eighteenth. He said the build
ing was a regular tinder box and he was
not surprised at its destruction. He al
ways considered it a menace to surround
ing property. .The adjoining building
Henry Friedrich's furniture factory, 2147
2169 Folsom street, was saved.
By the destruction of the plant 150 men
and girls are thrown out. Of employment.
The structure was a two-story rambling
affair 275 by 500 feet. In the rear was
stored the lumber used in the manufac
ture of furniture. This was also destroy
ed. The company had considerable work
on hand and keenly feels the loss.
The lower floor was used in the manu
facture of wire mattresses, and the sec
ond story for upholstering and the mak
ing of mattresses. The property was own
ed by John Center, and was not covered
by insurance. j;- >;
For a time the new Seventeenth Street
Police Station was menaced by firer'Cap
tain Anderson stationed his men on the
roof with buckets and they wet the build
ing thoroughly. Captain Anderson 'gath
ered all his books and papers together,
sent the prisoners on his hands to the
Central Police Station and then went out
with a big squad of men and kept the
streets clear.
STATION IS MENACED.
During the progress of the fire Joseph
O'Brien, a hoseman of Engine No. 29, was
severely burned on the hands and face
and was sent to the City and . County
Hospital for treatment. His injuries, al
though painful, are not dangerous, and he
was able to go to his home.
Residents in the vicinity were rudely
awakened from sound slumber and rushed
from their homes with valuables thinking
they were in danger. Householders poured
water over their homes to save, them from
being ignited by the fierce flames. Glasses
were cracked and paint peeled off by the
heat, but otherwise the 'structures "were
not harmed.
Within live minutes after the fire was
discovered the building was a mass of
flames. It was impossible to save any
part of it and the firemen devoted their
attentions to preventing it from spread
ing. . . .
John Belfrage was in the yard when he
first saw the flames. He said they covered
the roof, in the direction of Eighteenth
street. He started to give the alarm, but
was unable to get out of the yard, the
gate being locked. Officer Murrin of the
Seventeenth-street station, which Is close
to the destroyed property, was on his way
to the station to report off duty when he
saw Belfrage trying to get out. .He
promptly broke down the gate and was on"
his way to turn in an alarm when the en
gines began to arrive.
WHERE FIRE STARTED.
W. A. Schrock, owner of the plant, was
apprised of his loss at an early hour this
morning. He said the building and con
tents were covered by a blanket insurance,
but it would not cover'the loss he has sus
tained. He valued the contents at $15,000.
But for the splendid work of Chief Sul
livan and his men, surrounding property
might have been destroyed, as a . heavy
wind was blowing, but the firemen poured
heavy streams on the burning building
and lumber from all sides, confining. the
conflagration to the one point.
The plant of the California Lounge and
Mattress Company, Seventeenth and Fol
som streets, was destroyed by fire short
ly before midnight - last night. Three
alarms were turned in from box'149, and
the fire department turned ' out in force.
The flames threw -a reflection in the sky
that could be seen for many blocks and
hundreds of people hurried to see the
rapidly consuming building.

General .Appraisment Work
Calls Him Officially to

United States General Appraiser Mar
lon de Vries, formerly Congressman
from the Second District of California, ar
rived in this city yesterday morning from
New -York and took apartments at the
Palace.
He is here on official business and will
take testimony on about fifty appeal
cases at the Federal building. To-morrow
evening he will. leave f8r Los Angeles on
general appraisement work and will then
return to San' Francisco to finish his busi
ness here. \ : â
He is accompanied by United ' States
Consul A. H. Washburn and Secretary
J. E. Dorsey. .' '
Appraiser de Vries was warmly wel
comed by his I many friends. He is in
splendid. health and is. glad to return to
California. On the contusion of his offi
cial work he will spend a short vacation
at Lake Tahoe. In an interview he said:
-In my official capacity I am compelled to
travel over the United States. I arranged with
The other members of the beard to take the
testimony in the cases in California, as I
wished to spend by summer vacation here.
"A general appraiser visits all the ports in
the United States, deciding the merits of ap
peals of importers who feel that they have been
vharged too high a duty by the Collector of
the Port; --We do -not decide the case- at once,
but wait until we return to New York, where
the case is decided by the entire board. Should
this decision, not meet -with the approval of
the importer I he can appeal the case to the
United States District Court, but there are
only about 2 per cent of the cases ever ap
pealed to this tribunal. .
into the entrance way, -which is sided by
two large showcases, a robber - placed a
revolver at his head and ordered him to
pass over whatever money he Tarried, at
the same; time . cautioning him not to
make an outcry. For a moment Leathers
stood speechless and undecided as to how
to act. When a second command to make
haste was made Leathers jumped for
ward and seized the robber by. the wrist.
A struggle ensued and although Leathers
battled against heavy . odds . he bravely
clung to the robber and prevented him
from using .the revolver. The robber,
who was strong and heavily built, cursed
Leathers .roundly and tried to turn the
barrel of the revolver on him.
The struggle lasted for a short time and
as Leathers was breaking the robber's
grip on the revolver the latter remarked:
"Let me have the gun and we will call
it - square." Leathers â¢ was taking no
chances, however, and continued' the bat
tle, v .
' The noise of the struggle attracted the
attention of Mrs.. Leathers, who was read
ing in a room in the rear of the store.
At' the sound of footsteps approaching
the door, the robber hesitated for a mo
ment and Leathers, taking advantage of
the opportunity, knocked the revolver :o
the ground. The highwayman immediate
ly made a dash for the. street and Leath
ers, without waiting | to Â¦ recover the re
volver, gave chase.
'Leathers says several men were stand
ing in front of a saloon near by and many
pedestrians were passing -along tlie street
at the time of the holdup. . "I would have
called them to my assistance," said
Leathers, when he exhibited his skinned
knuckles at police headquarters, "had it
not been that the daring of the robber
took my speech away. A sudden impulse
prompted me to seize his pistol hand and
after that, realizing that he was trying to
