SCENE IN THE PRINCIPAL' TOWN OF;

OFFICIAL. WHO PERISHED. . . '
The coal companies continue their prep
arations for a long struggle. Mine mules
ere being brought to the surface) and
placed in pasture, clerks and other em
pioyes are being laid off and other steps
have been taken to keep down expenses.
Tfce ccal-carrylng railroad companies are
laying off coal train crews every day, and
the local electric railway company, "whlcn
has lines to all the surrounding towns,
has reduced its service 50 per cent and
placed its employes on half time. Busi
ness generally Is stagnant, and coal in
this section is becoming scarce. Many of
the foreign mine laborers, in anticipation
cl a prolonged struggle, have left the re-
Eion. (Â¦'*'::*"> : T-
Notwithstanding that 145,000 men have
been idle for the last five days, no dis
turbances of any kind have been reported
here. All the delegates left for their
homes to-day and Hazleton to-night pre
sents a deserted appearance. President
Mitchell said that he had had no com
munication with any one bearing on a
settlement of the strike.
PEACE AT TTAZLETON.
The matter of calling out the engineers,
firemen and pump runners ' from the
anthadte mines to allow the workings to
become flooded and damaged was left by
the convention to the discretion of the
national and district officers. It was said
at strike headquarters to-day that the
United Mine Workers' organization has
all along followed a policy (of protecting
mine property on the ground that the de
struction of accumulated wealth, as a
rule, ultimately affected the workmen
seriously.
Indianapolis said to-day that within the
next two or three weeks, regardless of the
special convention, 30,000 men in Virginia
and West Virginia and from 15,000 to 20,000
in the soft, coal region of Central Penn
sylvania will be on strike. They will be
called out, he said, for the purpose of
forcing the mine owners to give them
higher wages and Incidentally to help >the
enthracite workers. These men are part
ly organized.
According to the rules of the United Mine
Workers, a petition signed by five mine
workers' districts is necessary to call a
special convention. The three anthracite
districts are unanimous for such a meet
ing, and it Is likely that the West Vir
ginia district and the Michigan district
Trill consent to the Issuance of the call.
National Secretary-Treasurer Wilson of
An absolutely trustworthy source is au
thority for the statement that the gpecial
convention will be called probably to meet
in Indianapolis in the course of several
weeks.
CALL TOR CONVENTION.
If a special convention is called and the
miners succeed in their object it will seri
ously affect 449,000 men who are employed
in and about the coal mines of the coun
try. Coal would soon become scarce, and
this would ultimately result in the tying
up of railroads and all sorts of industries
that use large quantities of the fuel. The
striking miners are enthusiastic over the
convention's action, and znosfof them can ,
..âÂ£Â«* only Â£ueeess,iu_ilÂ»Â«-proj>o6ition.^ .
It is their desire that a special conven
tion of the United Mine Workers of
America be called as soon as practicable
for the purpose of endeavoring to have all
the bituminous mine workers, both or
ganized and unorganized, involved in the
anthracite miners' struggle. This an
nouncement was officially made at noon
tc-day by President John Mitchell In a
natement of the deliberations of the dele
gates in convention.
HAZLETON, May 16.â The anthracite
mine workers In convention to-day, in or
der to -win their strike, unanimously de
cided upon a plan that, if carried into suc
cessful operation, would practically* tie up
the Industries of the country, paralyze
business and inconvenience;" the people
thoughout the United States.
That portion of the Forty-fourth street
viaduct close to the burning building was
densely packed, and suddenly about 200
feet of the hog runway, extending from
the viaduct north to the plant of Armour
& Co., gave way, precipitating 1000 per
sons to the ground. The firemen instantly
abandoned their work on the building and
devoted their energies to saving the peo
ple. All were taken from the- wreckage
within a few minutes. .It is said by tha
police that the , number of those injured
by the fall of the*Tvladuct is greatljj in
excess of the number reported. The prop
erty loss is fully covered by insurance.
It was not a minute after the explo
sion before the entire fifth floor was U
mass of flames. The flre was one of the
most spectacular that has been seen in
Chicago in recent years, and the display
attracted an enormous crowd of people,
who crowded all the narrow streets in the
stockyards and swarmed by thousands
upon the viaducts which pass through
the yards at a height of twenty feet from
the ground. /
The fire originated with the explosion of
three lard tanks on the fifth floor of the
building. There were a score of workmen
in the immediate vicinity of the tanks,
and a number of them, were badly burned
by the scalding lard.
The lard refinery had just been com
pleted, and was considered by its owners
the most . complete establishment of its
kind in the United States. It stood at tha
Intersection of Forty-third street and
Center avenue, and was five stories high
aid 250 "to 300 feet long. It was filled with
new and costly machinery, and during
the day 2000 people worked within its
walls. The night shift numbered 700, and
all of . them were in the building when
the fire broke out. It is thought all es
caped in safety, although the time al
lowed some of them was exceedingly
brief. "I,:.'
The fatally injured are: Jennie Smith,
stenographer German- American Provision
Company, both legs broken; Ray Irwin,
11 years of age, internally injured and
head badly cut; Israel Morris, driver po
lice patrol wagon, both legs broken;
Michael Malloy, driver of fire engine, in
ternal injuries; Miles McMara. broken
back; Maggie Frazier, internal injuries;
J. P. Bradshall, head crushed.
CHICAGO, May IS.â During the pro
gress of a fire which to-night destroyed
the lard refinery of Armour & Co. in the
Union stock yards, seventeen people were
injured, seven of them in a mamter which
will cause death in a short ! time. The
loss of the company is estimated by its
officers between $750,000 and $900,000, with,
all the chances in favor of the latter
figure.
There were a number of accidents,. but
by far the largest number of those who
were hurt met their injuries by the fall
ing of the hog runway, upon which they
were^stahdine to obtain a better view of
the fire. ;

"Scientists who made a- study of the

Mont Pelee was still belching smoke and

explosions caused great excitement on shore
and our last boat returned to us, bringing the
remainder of the negroes, including those who
had . sreviouBly refused to leave. | They had
been frightened by the reports, and Jumping
into the sea, had swum out to the boats.
We saved 000 people from the north side
where on account of the wind there were no*
60 many aehes. We take great pride in the
fact that the Danish flair was the first foreign
one at the scene of thfe disaster. We proceeded
to Fort de France and landed there the people

At the latter .port, a Government offlclalcame

Last Wednesday. May 14, the officers of oui

lapsed St. Pierre at noon. The British steamer

be aground. Mont Pelee was etlll smoking
and the town of St. Pierre now resembles

we thought to h* the cable repair ship Grap

the air. -â¢>'Â¦:' -.''-.: Â¦
In the morning we saw the French cruiser
Â£uchet and went near the ehore. The ashes
became dense as we approached- and many
dead bodies were floating . on the sea. ' They
were burned and swollen and floating in groups,
in some cases : of ten each. The dead hands
were knitted and the limbs were cramped.
Nearly all the bodies were those of white per
sons. As we approached St. Pierre we saw
the town was covered with ashes. We then
Joined the cruiser Suchet and the cable repair
ship Pouyer-Quertler and together went toward
Le Precheur. The rain of ashes was heavy
and shrouded the Suchet. As soon as the
atmosphere cleared ud we ran close to Le Pre
cheur and then to Hamcau des Sablnes. The
boats from all three ships were put overboard
and the rescue of people from the shore com
menced at 11 o'clock in the morning. We
were all covered with gray ashes, our eyes
were weeDlnff and the heat was intolerable.
Some of the negroes came out to us ln small
boats. They were nearly naked and some of
them Were laughing, while others were crying-.
Some of them carried chairs with them, while
others brought dogs and kittens as ail their
property. Their woolly hair was thick with
ashes. Several big pans on board our ship
were filled with cooked food and placed on

BIG BENEFIT
KINGSTON, island of St. Vincent
(Thursday afternoon). May 15.â A corre
spondent has just returned here from a
visit on horseback to the devastated dis
trict of this island, during which, he trav
eled fifty miles and penetrated to within
five miles of the Soufriere crater. The
ash-covered area of St. Vincent exceeds
that of Martinique, which the correspond
ent has also explored. The most con
servative estimate of the death rate here
now places the number at 1700. About
1300 bodies already have been interred.
CBOPS ABE BUINED.
There is a strange apathy exhibited
there which Americans cannot under
stand. An election set for Sunday, May
11. was actually held In tort de France
and the contest at the polls was as keen
ly contested as would have been possible
had Mont Pelee not killed 30,000 people a
score of miles away just three days
earlier. .
The United States cruiser Cincinnati ar
rived here from Martinique two days ago.
Officers report that the war vessel passed
through heavy showers of ashes. They
say that Mont Pelee is still blazing and
that the danger has not passed. The offi
cers insist that the American supplies
must be distributed by the American
Consul, or at least by an American com
mittee. The Martinique funds are ex
hausted, and persons bringing relief are
far from pleased with the attitude of the
local committees that have had charge of
affairs in Fort de France.
SHOWERS OF ASHES.
Down the east slope of the volcano a
stream of water can be seen flowing, but
no man has approached close enough to
it to tell whether It is fresh or impreg
nated with sulphur, as much of the water
of the island is.
The Soufriere seems to have completely
changed its shape. Its j top ' has disap
peared, and from a distance the moun
tain looks as though a mighty thumb had
pressed upon It, crushing down its apex.
"Where a pretty blue lake of great depth
existed a fortnight ago there is now a
bubbling caldron of molten lava. Above
this clouds of smoke and steam constant
ly rise. Over the entire island spreads a
peculiar mist, which is* injurious to the
eyes and which .contains noxious proper
ties which cause much distress. Some of
the huts built by the Carlb Indians still
stand and in every one there are bodies.
Scattered about in the open also there
are hundreds of bodies blistering in the
terrible heat. The result is that an cf
nuvia spreads over the island of St. Vin
cent which is nauseating and which
threatens a pestilence that will further
decimate the population. Such precautions
Â«s are possible are being taken to ward
off fevers, but the most that can be done
is very little. . . â¢
GATHEBI1TG BODIES.
Burial parties have been sent out. Bod
ies are being dragged with ropes to
trenches for interment and cremation has
bean resorted to. One great trouble lies
in the fact that many of the bodies are
too close to the â¢ Soufriere to be ap
proached. Until the volcano quiets down
they must remain to add to the stench
that is already almost unbearable.
Starvation is a condition that actually
exists in St. Vincent. Three thousand
refugees are being fed and sheltered by
the Government near Georgetown and
Kingston, but other thousands are m
need of food.
Supplies are coming in. but not fast
er.ough to meet the demands. It is re
ported that relief ships are hastening to
Kingston, and in a few more days it Is
believed that there will be food in plenty.
The water famine is causing more dis
tress than lack of food.
Many of the former supplies of water
have disappeared. Rivers that were run
ning banks full before the explosion of
Scurfiere are now dry. Wells have evap
orated, and only in the south half of the
island is there any water that can be
reached.
succession. They are not sufficiently se
vere to do great damage, but they fill the
inhabitants with fear, and if it were pos
sible to obtain transportation, it is safe
to say that St. Vincent would be depopu
lated in twenty-four hours.
The island is constantly in a tremble.
Earthquakes follow one another in quick
entists believe that the volcano
has not stopped emptying,, and there Is
a general expectation that there will be.

that building, as there are no beds for
their accommodation, though cots are be
ing rapidly constructed of boards. This

s-nce immediately after the disaster. Two
days elapsed, however, before there were
any burials, as the negroes refused to dig
the necessary trenches, though they were
oiiered three times the usual wages by
the local authorities. The nurses em
pioyed are incompetent; but theyare will-
Ins to learn and are working hard. The
negroes are indifferent to all that is trans
piring and to what has taken place. They
expect to receive Government rations, but
there have been instances where they
have refused to bury their own relatives
The entire northern part of the Island Is
covered with ashes to an average depth
of eighteen' inches, varying- from a â¢ thin
layer at Kingston to two feet, or more
at Georgetown. The crops are ruined,
nothing: green can be seen, the streets of
Georgetown are covered with heaps, of
ashes resembling snowdrifts, and ashes
rest so heavily on the roofs that in sev

DK. PIZKCE'S EEMEDIES.
Anxious thoughts sometimes perplex
the wife who sees maternity before her.
If she is treading an untried path, she
sometimes frets herself into a nervous
condition which is injurious and pros-
trating. If motherhood has already been
a painful experience she is apt to shrink
from the coming trial and by her very
mental anxiety increase the, possibility
of her suffering.
There is no cause for anxiety for those
prospective mothers who use Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription. It tranquilizes
the nerves, encourages the appetite, in-
duces refreshing sleep and produces
mental cheerfulness as well as physical
vigor. # It gives strength and muscular
elasticity so that the baby's advent is
practically painless. It is the best tonic
for nursing mothers.
"I am so thankful for what Dr. Wercc's Fa-
vorite Prescription has done for me," writes Mrs.
Tohn T. Smith, of Slocan. Brit. Col., Bor 50. "It
helped roe through the long months before baby
came and I have a big. strong baby girl, the
most healthy of the three, and it cured me of a
disease which was taking away all my strength."
The dealer who offers a substitute'
for' "Favorite Prescription" does so to
gain the little more profit paid on the
sale of less meritorious medicines. ' His
profit is your loss, therefore accept no
substitute.

Kern County Supervisors Julius J. Mack,
a banker of Bakersfield, filed suit In the
Superior Court for Kern County against
H. A^ Jastro, C. J. E. Taylor, Henry

asking that a contract they , had made

jail was rendered habitable and the gen
eral atpect and convenience of the city
as a county seat was largely bettered.
All of the 6 per cent bonds 'of 1893 were
originally purchased by the Illinois Loan
and Trust Company. By 1897 $15,000 of the
1893 bonds had matured and had been re
tired and canceled. Then another Illinois
bond company, Trowbridge & Co., Incor
porated, of Chicago, came upon the scene.
They sent a man out to California to
work up a proposition that they, were
prepared to submit, which was to refund
the remaining and. outstanding $233,000 of
6 per cents with 4*Â£ per cents, to run as
serials for a period of ten years, when the
last of the series would mature. The offer

Eome years ago wanted a County Hos
pital. Hall of Records, a building for its
high school, furniture for its County Jail,
bridges to span the Kern River and re
pairs upon its roads. To provide these It
had recourse to the familiar method of
raising moneyâ the issuance of bonds.
Daniel Kevane and Assistant Attorney
General Post, acting as the State Board
cf Examiners, made the purchase of two
lots of Kern County six per cent bonds.
For one lot of fifty bonds, having the face
value of $50,000, they paid $61,061 66. For
another lot of thirty-seven, having the
face value of $37,000, they paid $45,185 63.
On the larger lot the premium paid
amounted to $10,920, approximately an ad
vance of twenty per cent above the face
value of the bonds about to be taken in.
On the same lot the sum of $141 66 ac
crued interest was paid by the State. On
the smaller lot of bonds the State was
forced to pay a premium of $8080 80 on
$37,000, together with Interest added of
$104 83. In iess than six months from the
cate of these transactions the bonds 1 were
redeemed by Kern County, which paid
only the face value of them and six months'
interest at the rate of 6 per cent per
annum. The bonds would have been re
deemed earlier had not the entire matter
been tied up by the Supreme Court of
California- at the time Kevane and Post
leaded up for the State. In six months
Kern County had the same securities in
liand for $16,637 23 less than the State paid
tor them.
KEVANE AND POST SIT.
t
In Bakersfield the State officials are the
subject of ridicule as they are in the East.
Whenever the mention of the transaction
In Kern County bonds is mentioned a
ehiver of apprehension is visible on the
part of the bread and butter followers of
the present State administration at Sac
ramento. They know that Eastern men
reeking to unload their securities at a
profit were allowed to make California a
victim through the Gage administration.
They know that the wrath that will fol
low the revelation will be deep and abid
ing. But the truth, through the enter
prise of The Call, is out this morning.
Ac a matter of course the thousands
of dollars that California has lost-hav*
been put in other pockets. Where they
ere or who has been enriched is not def
initely known at this time. That is an
interesting and suggestive theme. How
was it brought about? There is another
queer feature to the entire matter. Kern
County, through Its Board of Supervis
ors, without giving any one else a chance
to bid, and notwithstanding the offer of a
reputable banker of Bakersfield to pay
a higher price than was included In the
contract made with Chicago bond-buyers,
refunding $235,000 of bonds, gave to the
State -of California thousands of dollars
less for its refunded 6 per cent bonds
than had. just before been paid for them
by this State.
The essential portions of the records
are reproduced, and records are given
that every- voter who cares for the pub
lic school system of California may see
how the school fund has been plundered.
They will have a chance to reflect upon
the humiliating position in which this
great commonwealth has been placed be
fore the public by its representatives.
They will realize that the bond buyers of
the " Kast grin" broadly and "derisively
when the name of California is men
tioned. Taking the most charitable view
of the matter, California has been, shame
fully hoodwinked. Accepting the expla
nation that it is all due to a mistake,
the fact will still appear, to the shame
of all Californians, that the State gov
ernment has been engaged in the pur
chase of $S7,000 worth of securities with
out any knowledge concerning them. Xo
banking institution on earth could be
guilty of such careless handling of so
great a sum. The public's servants have
only to plead that the money belonged to
the State and that they did not exercise
the most ordinary care.
The simplest statement of the transac
tion is that when 6 per cent bonds ol
Kern County, to the amount of $235,000,
were about to be refunded and retired,
the State of California, through its ser
vants, notwithstanding that the Kern
County people had voted to refund, and
the matter had been given so much pub
licity through proceedings in both the
Superior Court for Kern County and the
Supreme Court of California that every
voter of ordinary intelligence In the
State knew of rfhat fact, went into the
market and bought the old bonds and
paid for them a huge bonus and also ac
crued interest. How this was accom
plished may be the subject of future offi
cial inquiry. The story would be incred
ible if it were not substantiated by the
official records in the offices of the courts
that have been mentioned and in the
State Capitol at Sacramento.
THROUGH the Gage adminis
tration of the affairs of Cali
fornia many thousands of
dollars have been taken from
the school fund of this State
to enrich bond speculators
in the East. The shameful
transaction, for which the
Governor is responsible ex-officio, has
been carefully concealed for many
months. Those who knew of the matter
kept still. Now the full facts have been
learned by The Call and they are given
to the people of the State who suffer by
the dereliction of those whom they mis
takenly placed in power.

status of the securities when so large a
sum as $87,000 was involved.
The only other * Indispensable facts in
this connection, although there are
enough minor ones of the same general
sort to fill large newspaper space, are
supplied by the acts of the Legislature
and Governor Gage In 1901. Prior to that
a report of the State Board of Examiners
had appeared In which they congratulated
themselves for "saving the State." Then,
in 1901, a Senate bill was introduced,
which passed the Senate on February I
and the House on February 19, 1901. that
took the power from the State Board of
Examiners to act on its own motion in
making other bond purchases for the* in
vestment of moneys proceeding from the
school lands of the State, and bestowed
upon the State Treasurer the power to
make the investments. There were other
things in the bill that went through the
two houses of the Legislature.
When the bill came to Governor Gage
he vetoed It. {The Board of Examiners
has the same power that it had before
it made the strange deal described In the
foregoing and Governor Gage, In the light
of all the facts, vetoed the bill mentioned.
The text of the bill that was vetoed by
Governor Gage Is as follows:
Section 1 â Section stx hundred and eighty of
the Political Code is hereby amended to as to
read as follows:
680 â Whenever and as often as there is in
the . State Treasury the sum of ten thousand
dollars as the proceeds of the sale of State
school lands, the State Treasurer, by and with
the advice and approval of the State Board of
Examiners, shall invest the same In the civil
funded bonds of this State, or In the bonds of
the United States, or in the bonds of the sev
eral counties, or of the several municipalities,
or of the several school districts of this State,
the investments to be made in such manner and
on such terms as the State Treasurer, by and
with the advice and approval of the State
Board of Examiners, shall deem for the best
Interests of the State school fund; provided,
that no bonds of any county, or of any munici
pality, or of any school district, shall be pur
chased of which the' debt, debts or liabilities
at the time exceed" 15 per cent of the assessed
value of the taxable property of said county,
or of said municipality, or of said school dis
trict.
Section 2 â ThiÂ« act shall take effect imme
diately.
ARGUES FOR BOARD.
Had the Governor approved of this bill
the Examiners would have been com
pelled to take a back seat for the State
Treasurer in this matter. The language
of the veto says that the Governor saw
no reason for taking from the Board of
Examiners their present powers. The
substantial part of the veto is as follows:
I herewith return to your honorable body
without my approval Senate bill No. 1Q9, en
titled "An act to amend Â¦ section 680 of the
Political Code, relating to the investment of
moneys proceeding from the sale of State school
lands." 'A
It is proposed by the present bill to amend
section 6S0 of the Political Code by taking from
the State Board of Examiners the power of In
vesting the proceeds of the sale of State school
lands In the civil funded Txmas of this State,
United States bonds, ' and in bonds of the sev
eral counties, and giving this power to the
State Treasurer, to be exercised by and with
the approval of the Board of Examiners, and
with like further power to said State Treas
urer to invest said money in bonds of the sev
eral municipalities and school districts of this
State. < -
I perceive no reason I nor necessity for this
transfer of duty from the Board of Examiners,
and danger may be apprehended from author
izing the investment of such school funds in
municipal and school district bonds. It would
be difficult .for the State Treasurer and Board
of Examiners to become acquainted and satis
fled with these various classes of securities for
investment, and besides entailing great labor
upon the Attorney General in their examin
ation, it is not unlikely that politics might i n
the -future enter as a factor in the negotiations
for the sale of such municipal and school dis
trict securities, thus imperiling the safety of
these funds. â¢
It is preferable that the school money should
remain partly uninvested, waiting the better
class of securities, than that the capital should
be subjected to the risk of future complications
and embarrassments which might arise under
the proposed bill. Â»
That the chances for successfully raid-
Ing the California State school fund were
carefully calculated In the East before
the unparalleled attempt was made Is un
questioned. There were bondholders who
wanted to unload profitably before the re
funding could be brought about, and the
State of California furnished a shininjj
mark for them. Â¦ â¢ . : ."Â¦.-.

SOME OF THE SCENES FAMILIAR TO SPECTATORS WHO ATTEND BUR
LINGAME COUNTRY CLUB'S ANNUAL HORSE SHOWS. AND HORSES
WHICH WILL BE SEEN IX THE RING ON DECORATION DAY.
A peculiar 1 , circumstance attending the
academic tennis tournament last year
was the fact that Norman Hodgkinson of
Lowell High School won the singles tour
nament without playing a match.- Eight
schools were represented, but were so
completely outclassed by the Lowell man
that each man defaulted to him until he
had won the tournament without playing
a game. This is the first time this has
ever happened on the . coast, and It may
never happen again. . .
The following teams have already en
tered: Berkeley High Schoolâ Clinch, sin
gles; Esterly ' and N. Ambrose, doubles.
Alameda. High Schoolâ C. Lewis, singles;
C.' Lewis and M. Epstein, doubles. Oak
land High Schoolâ R. Gorrlll, singles;
Hinds and Smith, : doubles. California
School of Mechanical Arts â Harry Gor
ham, singles; Gorham and, Leonard Cut
ler, doubles. Lowell High Schoolâ Al Ro
senberg, singles; -Rosenberg and Alec
Beyfuss,' doubles. Trinity Schoolâ G. Rid
ley, singles; Ridley and Henry Mills, dou
bles. St. Matthew'sâ L. J. Webb, singles!
Beyfuss, Rosenberg's J partner. Is the
smallest player In, the league, but is quite
clever. Harry Gdrham of Lick is capable
of playing a! strong game and should not
be overlooked in Wguring the chances of
different school $i Carl Gardner, who
played for Lowell last year, left school a
month-agp and will not participate. Had
he remained in school X/Owell would have
won again? this )^ar' without an effort.
Play in the' tournament to-day will com
mence at 9 o'cIock. . - â¢Â¦"
Many of the tennis players are moving
out of town.- for the summer months and
the club courts do not present so lively a
scene as they have in the past few'
months. The park courts are becoming
more popular than ever. Each week the
attendance is increasing. It will probably
be necessary in a !Â»hort time to lay out
more courts. -
The next tournament of any importance
will be the. annual State championship
tournament inaugurated last year.- The
date of this event is the 3d and 4th of
July, formerly the dates of the coast
championship tournaments. The latter
will again be played in September. All
the champlonshin tournaments this year
will be held on 'the Hotel Rafael courts,
San- Rafael. There will probably be a
class singles tournament.qn the California
'Club cpurt.son: Decoration day. The sec
ond class single* tournament 'for' the chal
lenge cups will be held on the park courts
a week '.from Sunday. '
For the last five years the players of
one school or another have so outclassed
their opponents as to rob the matches of
all interest. This year the schools are
evenly matched and each is thought to
have a good chance of winning. Lowell
High School has won the championship
for the last three years and 'her repre
sentatives are slight favorites this year.
Al Rosenberg is easily the best player In
the league, but~has not' practiced -at' all
during the past year. If his strength
holds out he should win the 'singles; j to
day. Rosenberg's most dangerous oppo
nent is Will Geary of the Polytechnic
High School.
The latter school is strong in both dou
bles and singles, but it is doubtful if Its
players will be able to take part. The en
try list closed Wednesday, and Polytech
nic has not as yet sent in the names of
its representatives. If the school officials
can give a good excuse for not sending In
the names matters will be' arranged sat
isfactorily, and the team allowed to com
pete, otherwise the Polytechnic entries
will not be accepted. It is to be hoped
Polytechnic will be allowed to take part,
as otherwise the interest in the, tourna
ments would be greatly lessened and vic
tory would again go to Lowell High School
without much of a struggle. It is thought
by many that Geary will defeat Rosen
berg should 'the two meet.
THE, annual tennis tournament for the
championship of the Academic Ath
letic League will be played on the
' California Club courts this morning
and next Saturday, morning. To-day
the singles will be played, while the dou
bles are scheduled for next Saturday.

Last Saturday and Sunday there was
a goodly gathering of yachts In Paradise
Cove. The Corinthian fleet included
Commodore Sagar's Edna and the sloops
Truant Emma and Freda. In the Califor
nia fleet were the flagship Thelma and
the Eloops Pactolus. Occident, Jessie E
Catharine and Mascotte, the schooner
Challenge and the yawl Idler. The San
Francisco yachts Sappho, Thetis. Cygnus
Chiepa, Surprise and Water Witch also
cruised to the cove. H. R. Simpkins' yawl
Tramontana Is in commission, her Sails
having been bent- in during .the week
Louis Q. Haven of the San Francisco
Yacht Club has chartered J. M, Mattoon's
sloop Amigo and will moor, her at Sausa-
Hto during the season. "(5. B. 'Edgar M.
Kramer and A. Haven will sail with' the
charterer. The schooner; Wave is_on the
ways at Old Sausalito, having more lead
put In her keel and her rig changed to
that of a yawl.
Yachtsmen are Inclined to think the out
come of the race between Harpoon and
The Challenger a much more open mat
ter than before. While The Challenger
was in course of construction and after
she had been dropped Into the water, most
yachtsmen thought the result of the con
test a foregone conclusion in favor of the
new boat, which was regarded as a racing
machine designed by one of the most
skillful and experienced Eastern design
ers. Even the Corinthians, while Intend
ing to make the best possible defense,
looked on the Perpetual cup as almost
L os n* and )&J ked of the boat they would
build In 1903 to win It back. Presto was
first selected by the club as the defender
because her performances and the skill
pi her owner were well known, whereas
less was known of Harpoon, which had to
be greatly cut down to bring her within
the limit of 10 per cent above the racing
length of The Challenger. Harpoon, while
having a water line of about 45 feet, has
a racing length of only 32.87 feet, and so
will have to concede only 4 minutes and
14 seconds over the Corinthian course of
fourteen miles to The Challenger, taking
her length at 30 feet. Â¦ As The
Challenger has never been measured her
racing length may prove to be below 30
fe Â«Â»"?. *>y cutting down her sail area,
might be still further reduced. In that
case the San Francisco committee will ask
.for an additional allowance from Har
poon. Those who have seen much of the
work of The Challenger think she carries
too much canvas for the breezes prevail
ing in this bay during the summer and
also that her rigging and gear 'are too
w<>ak for. the strain to .wliicb they are
subjected.
After last Sunday's race between Frank
Stone's Presto and Sharpe and Toepke"s
Harpoon the committee, consisting of
Commodore E. F. Sagar and ex-Commo
dores J. W. Pew and Alex J. Young, se
lected Harpoon as the defender of the
Perpetual Challenge Cup. The club had
already Bpent a considerable sum in put
ting a lead keel on Presto and fitting her
for the race, but the performances of
Harpoon showed the latter to be clearly
the faster boat. The committee will now
devote its attention to putting Harpoon
Into the best possible trim. Already she
has been fitted with a new suit of sails
v.-hich were used last Sunday and proved
excellent. After the cruise to Vallejo she
will be taken up on the ways, where her
rigging will be thoroughly overhauled.
During the past week the Corinthian
regatta committee held a meeting and
sent a communication through Secretary
J. C. Bnckell to W. M. Edgell, secretary
of the San Francisco Yacht Club, asking
for a meeting of the regatta committees
of the two clubs at an early date. The
*San Francisco committee consists of W.
-G. Morrow, Dr. T. L. Hill and J. R.
Savory, while E. B. Learning:. T. J. Kav
anaugh and P. J. Martenstein compose the
Corinthian committee. The Joint commit
tee will have full charge of all matters
connected with the race, and will select
a referee not a member of either of the
clubs.
race have been postponed. Commodore R.
S. Bridgman, Vice-Commodore A. C. Lee,
J. R. Savory of the sloop Juanita and A.
W. Follansbee of the yawl Phyllis are
sailing on board The Challenger, so the
number of yachts that would be likely
to attend a cruise is considerably- re
duced. The race from Vallejo â¢will take
place on one of the open dates after the
race for the Perpetual Challenge Cup is
over.
The cua event is taking up so much
Â¦at the attention of the San Franciscos
that other things are being disregarded.
There will, however, be quite enough
Corinthian and California yachts at Val
lejo to make a good display. The yachts
n:en will be received by the Vallejo
Yachting and Boating Club, .whose new
clubhouse is ready.
Next Saturday the San Francisco Yacht
Club has a cruise to Paradise Cove on its
programme with a clambake and games
on Sunday, May 25. The dates are open
on the Corinthian schedule, to afford the
yacht owners an opportunity to prepare
for the annual regatta on Decoration
Day. The regatta committee of the Cor
inthians has already prepared the circu
lar f.or the seventeenth annual regatta.
The yachts will be divided as usual into
six classes, the first of which will start
at 11:50 a. m.; the second at noon, and tha
rest at Intervals of ten minutes. In order
to afford spectators an opportunity of
seeing the regatta, a steamer will accom
pany the racing yachts, tickets being sold
at fifty cents each. . Â«-â¢ ]
YACHTSMEN will gather in numbers

"Not How Cheap,
At a meeting of the directors of the Re
publican Primary League last " evening
various plans - for effecting district or
ganization and enrollment were discussed.
It was the sense of the directory that
the most important work at hand was tho
registration of voters.
A resolution was adopted urging alt citi
zens to register, on the ground that not
only a Governor, but a United States Sen
ator la to be chosen, at the coming 1 elec
tion. Measures were taken by the league
to agitate the subject of registration and
induce the great . army of voters to reg
ister in time to vote at tne primary elec
tion on August 12. Registration is nov
open at the main office in the. City Hall,
and as there is no rush for enrollment
this is a good time to register.
All the directors of the league attended
the session of the board last night.
Charles Sutro was elected treasurer, J.
"VV. Rogers, Daniel Rich and .FranJc

BRONX PARK HANDICAP

lj rhere was a preliminary between Billy
Woods and Jim Tremble, both of Los An
geles,* which went twenty rounds and was
declared a draw. It was not at all brutal.
Champion Jeffries announced from the
ring before the fight that . he and Bob
Fltzsimmo.s would flght In Los Angeles
early in . July, for the world's champion
ship. '
Thomas McCarey, manager of the Cen
tury Athletic Club, said to-night the pros
pects for the fight between Jeffries and
Fitzsimmons taking place in Los Angeles
were bright. * ,
The flght was uninteresting up to thÂ«
knockout. Jack Jeffries showed up well
in cleverness and footwork, but ~dld not
develop a damaging punch. The colored
man, however, proved strong and used,
both right and left with effect
In the fifth round, while the men were
sparring cautiously, Johnson forced Jef
fries into a corner, and, feinting witn hl3
left, sent in a hard right to thÂ© neck bÂ«- .
low the ear. Jeffries fell like a log. -After
he had been counted out thÂ© champion
carried his helpless brother from the ring.
It was thought for a time Jeffries had
sustained severe injuries, but he soon
came around.
LOS ANGELES, May 15.â Jack Jeffrie*,
brother of the champion boxer, wu
knocked out in the fifth round to
night by Jack Johnson (colored) of
Chicago. The fight was held at Hazards*
Pavilion under the management of thÂ«
Century Club, which has been negotiating
with Fitzsimmons for the championship
flght. It was witnessed by a large crowd,
estimated at 4000.
Among the riders who will take part are

SAN FRANCISCO.
Oakland lajd low until the ninth. They
had several chances to pile up a few more
runs, but did not seem desirous of mak
ing the score too one-sided. Francks and
Lehman took a mean advantage of the
generous Kane and walked to first in the
ninth. Cristall had two strikes called on
him, and then lifted the next one over
the farthest corner of the right field
fence for the longest and prettiest home
run trip of the season.
The contest was utterly without feature
save for Kane's miserable exhibition of
pitching. The Ponies outbatted Oakland
by eleven hits to seven, but all the latter
made were timely. The Ponies could hit
in grand style when no one was on bases.
Holly punched out three hits out of four
trips to the rubber, and McHale and
Shugart made two each. Delmas saved
Uncle Henry three runs and robbed-Buck
Francks of a two-cushion drive by cap
turing a hard fly to center in the second.
There were three on the sacks and two
gone at the time. The wind interfered
with the work of the fielders to a certain
extent and it was almost impossible to
capture fly balls. Oakland played an er
rorless game. The score:
The initial explosion put the kibosh on
the localsâ not exactly the Inning, but the
remarkable faculty Kane developed for
walking men when the sacks were filled
to overriowlng. In all Oakland hammered
out as many as five runs, being gracious
ly, aided by four singles, four bases on
balls and a rank error by McNichols.
â¢ McNichols scored for the Ponies in
round one on a two-bagger, a sacrifice
and Nordyke's fly to right. They made
another in the third in exactly the same
manner, and scored the last two in the
sixth and seventh by means of some
timely hitting.
The . honorable Mr. Harry Kane, who
toed the rubber for the locals, only gave
ten bases on balls. .The dust blew around
in a charming manner and half the spec
tators managed to escape in the clouds,
thinking it was a volcanic eruption which
was going to rival the Martinique disas
ter.' .One-fourth of the remainder lay
down behind the bar" and went to sleep,
and those who were brave enough to.re
main wanted their money back.
IT is a long, Bad, pitiful tale, the story
of that ball- game yesterday at Recrea
tion Park... It lasted about as long as
two games and contained everything
except good baseball. Â¦ -

Any resident of Oakland, used to seeing
the familiar form of John L. Davie, .clad
in dignified garments of the tailor's best
workmanship, Impressive of feature arid
polished of manner, would have been
amazed upon drawing rein at the field
fence to recognize this same man In the
industrious laborer who was hoeing, the
way for a generous crop of .mealy tubers.
Davie wore a blue flannel shirt tucked Into
blue overalls and the overalls tucked into
high boots. He wore no hat" and his
sleeves were rolled up, exposing arms as
brown as the manzanlta berries. His face
was tanned to almost the hue of an In
dian's. â¢ - : Â¦â¢Â¦.:Â¦;â¢-â¢ Â¦ â¢ .-. â¢ .--..
- - and a pick on a ranch in the
Ono hills, twenty miles west of Redding.
He hoes long rows of potatoes beneath
the May sun from dawn until dark, and
for a change of occupation he is occasion
ally allowed to take a pick and work for
a while In the hard auartz . rock of ' an
adjacent mining -claim. For six â¢ months,
he has put in every day, when the weather
was not | so bad as to absolutely ' forbid
outdoor work, at the hardest kind of man
ual labor.
EDDING, May 16.â John L. Davie.
former Mayor of Oakland, is now
earning his living and saving his
â¢ life by vigorously swinging a hoe
Â¦ Â¦Â¦ ' The provisional ' itinerary , announced be

ing for an . extended " tour -of the northern
c.'tles, i where they will . cross " bats with "a

taJn 'Tyrrel. Hamlhv and â¢ Manager. Ezra
Decoto this Â¦ trip has been planned to be
the longest and most ' comprehensive the
college ball tossers have everr.taken. '.'.
, "I have -come to really love this sort
cf life I am forced to lead," 'said the man
who personally conducted the cltyls case3
against the Southern Pacific while he was
Mayor of >Oakland. -"It is so free â¢ and
exhilarating and so close to nature. . -I
eat- like a bear now and have fresh meat
on Sundays." - â¢ * 'Â¦
â¢'. Davie was not sure that he. was done
with politics., ,r : .-.'Â¦
- "\ may bob up serenely again some time.
I got a lot of unpleasant newspaper no
tbriety before, but The Call * helped - me
very greatly in, the people's fight. Time
may r shift things around again." . -
And \ with that the- bareheaded â¢ man
looked again at his rows of potatoes,
shouldered his hoe and strode. off to eat
the dinner 'of i bacon :and beans which
Loeffler I had '. prepared | and then â¢- to - wipe
the dishes for the farmer..
.Mr.- Davie. was greatly \ interested to
learn | that Bret Harte and Admiral Samp
son were 1 dead.^ He said he had always
admired the author of "The Outcasts of
Poker Flat." He' believed Sampson had
wronged Schley and hoped that Schley
would now get the full honors due him.
. "Since you do no reading- you doubtless
have other diversions. Perhaps you play
ping-pong?" the visitor remarked.
"Ping-pong! : What in the world is ping
pong?" -
.Evidently he told the truth when he
said he had not read the newspapers in
six months.- .â¢; ..Â¦-...-Â¦
- As Davie bent over ' his hoe the mark
on the waistband of his overalls showed
thirty-six inches, and they were fully two
inches too large for him. In six months
his girth has lost ten inches.

In all this time Davie has not seen a
newspaper, or received a letter except from
his closest relatives. His friends are not
allowed -to know his address and no busi
ness matters can reach his ears.
In Bullychoop district in Western Shasta
Davie owns some mining claims, rln visit
ing them he had met Gottlieb Loeffler, a.
hardy- German truck ; farmer, of the sec
tion. Loeffler had a comfortable home,,
lived' a-- bachelor 'life' alone 'and l - had,-no
neighbors. In ten j . dayst after ; the' ulti
matum ' from I tho ! doctor j John | L.., Davie
was sharing Gottlieb'. Ijoeffler's .quarters
and his occupation:' For six- months' he
has worn i neither coat- nor hat and' only!
storm and darkness have 'driven him in-,
side the house. He has become .an- ex
pert 'gardener- and can :' swing the. pick
with any: miner of . the district. . He. has
grown /horny fisted and tanned, -lie goes
to .bed. at dark and rises before the sun/-
The cure is working and- Davie will not
die. for; his stomach is no longer a sugar'
TOILS FOR TRUCK rFAEMER.
Then the man who gave Oakland its
first; and famous' ride to San Francisco
for 5 cents told how he came to leave the
city "by the bay to its fate for ' half a
year -while he came to .a' remote; spot in
the Shasta hills ' to usurp -an unskilled
laborer's Job. â¢Â¦ - . v â¢ -. Â¦ .
Mr. Davie contracted a stubborn stom
ach trouble of a most peculiar kind.
Everything that he ate changed to sugar
in his system. Even pretzels Â¦ were sac
charine to him. Hl3 weight increased
alarmingly- and his girt^ expanded* to
forty-four inches. He breathwd with'dif
ficulty and - slept scarcely- at all.'. .His
nervous system and his mind felt the
strain. At last his Â¦ physician - told him
that salvation might be found in a rugged
life in the open air, with hard work for
his hands and complete rest for his mind.
Otherwise he must die. â¢ , - .;-. :.;

. BUSINESS^-R., Winthrop, Cal. ,' There
is a Jaw in this. State in relation to change
in business firms which Is as follows:
The coronation will be stately and superb, but" its
splendor will be as nothing to the gorgeous imperial
displa/ which is soon to follow in London upon the
coronation of King Edward, and consequently it 'will
receive. comparatively little attention from the world
at 5 laifge. That fact is a striking, illustration of the
mutability of national power. There was a time when
the Kings of Spain were the mightiest monarchs of
Europe and those of Great Britain were insignificant
beside. them. The changes' brought about by war"
and trade have swept away the wide empire of the
great Kings of Spain, and to-day. the Anglo-Saxon
lords it where once the Spaniard ruled. The law of
mutability holds on its way," however, in undimin
ished force, and within a; century or so perhaps the
British empire may be as .narrow as ; thatof Spain
to-day. . ~ ;'j Â¦'
Such speculations, however, will not be ' in the
thoughts of the young King at the coronation" nor in
those, of any of the brilliant array of men and women
who' form his court.his;; cabinet .and his council.
They are concerned with the troubles of to-day. Al
fonso XIII is to ascend ;a throne that is riot much
more secure than a city built upon the slopes of a vol
canic mountain.' Discontented; elements of all kinds
exist among his^ people and his nobles. There is no
telling at what moment an outbreak may occur, nor
what may be the nature of it. Poorly paid working
men may strike, destitute peasants may rise} angry
DIGNITARIES 'from all parts of the world
have gathered at Old Madrid to convey the
congratulations of Emperors^ Kings, poten
tates, peoples and nations to Alfonso XIII upon his
coronation. Dispatches announce that the Duke of
Connaught, who represents Edward of Great Britain,
and Grand Duke Vladimir, who represents the Czar
of Russia, were already there when the special envoy
-Â¦from the "United States arrived to present to the
young King the greetings and felicitations of Presi

ANSWERS, TO QUERIES:
This expedition . is the laughing-stock of the Sen
ate, where the commissioners are hailed .as advertis
ing agents of yellow journalism, who work for their
.bed and board and the, privilege of getting their
names in print. They will finish their stunt and
come back, all but one to soon retire to private life
to shine in rivalry with that amusing sideshow called
"A box of monkeys.''
Since then there has been no chance to do much in
the line of advertising which he so much affects.
But Cuba is about to inaugurate an independent gov
ernment and Hearst discovers that in order to es
tablish a good understanding between the island arid
this country it is necessary to send a yachtload of
commissioners to the inauguration of Palma. For \
long time he has been drumming the Senate for vol
unteers who will sell their self-respect for a dead-'
head trip and victuals and drink. Those who watched
his scheme as it was worked in Washington have
been much amused during its progress and by its re
sult The angry snubbing he has endured from self
respecting Senators would make a more sensational
story than any that has appeared in his triplets since
his faked interview with the Pope. Sometimes re
pulsed in the Senate marble room, frequently politely
ordered out of Senators' apartments in hotels and
often getting a stinging rebuke that made their ears
tingle, his representatives have done the best they
could, but it is what fishermen call "a water haul."
He succeeded in inducing Mason of Illinois, Jones of
Arkansas and Thurston of Nebraska to be his sand
wich men. Mason and Jones have just been beaten
for re-election in their States by majorities so over
whelming as to be the instrument of humiliation,
and Thurston at the end of his term a year ago "dared
not apply for re-election and is already a very: ex-
Senator. To this list of hungry and thirsty ,; has-'
beens he succeeded in adding Money of Mississippi,
who has packed sandwich-boards for him before..
Senator Money has just distinguished himself by
stabbing a streetcar conductor in Washington for de
manding a transfer from him under the rules of the
company. For this the Senator was, hauled into the
police court and acquired a reputation which is more
useful on Hearst's yacht than in the Senate.
That opened the .eyes of Hearst's dupes and they
scuttled to cover as soon as possible to save them
selves from a share of the derision which fell upon
him. . . , 'Sii't
I decline to permit my sorrow for the men lost on the
Maine to be perverted Into an advertisement for the
New York Journal. GROVER CLEVELAND.
Hearst's next move was to use the dead of the
Maine for his own notoriety, and he organized a
"Journal Monument Association," to build them a
memorial with money contributed by others. He
roped in men like Levi P. Morton, William C. Whit
ney and others, who had. interests exposed to injury
from his malice or revenge. Having succeeded so
well, his effrontery went to , the length of requesting
Mr. Cleveland to act as vice president of the monu
ment association. Mr. Cleveland's reply is a classic!
It stripped the charlatan and left him exposed to the
pelting of ridicule and contempt, which ended his ad
vertising scheme. It cannot be too frequently
quoted. Here it is, as neat a job of flaying as was
ever done with a. pen:' m \
W. B. HEARSTâ
THE use of public men and measures for the
purpose of advertising himself has been one of
the amusing tricks of Mr. W. R. Hearst. He
found frequent opportunity to play it before and
during the Spanish war. His celebrated yacht excur
sions for "Journal commissions," composed of^
United States Senators, are not forgotten by those,
who participated, though some would like to forget
They cruised and came back to make speeches which
they would now gladly expunge from the record, but
they had to sing for their supper, though their per
formances gained more ridicule than applause.

Sooner or later we must make the payments re
quired by prosperity, and!.. we might., as well make
them now as at a later time. It is the duty, of the
Supervisors to make ample 'appropriations for need
ful .expenses- in fixing the tax levy for the ensuing
year,, and it is the duty of citizens to support them in
doing it. There can be no excuse, of course for ex
travagance or t waste.;* Money, should not be appro
'priated to any. department of the municipal govern
ment for the. support of tax-eaters or to be - squan
dered on foolish projects. Economy,' however, does
not mean parsimony. Ample schools, '.'good, streets
and an adequate' police, force may come high, but we
must have .them, and; it; is ; the duty of the - Super
visors to provide fox<them: â¢ ."" I â¢ ' "
A progressive city requires a progressive expendi
ture/ The rule applies without exception to every
civilized community. We cannot maintain our
schools or police our streets with the 'amount), of
money, that would have been sufficient had there been
no progress. The avenues along which communities
pass-to metropolitan prosperity are not free. At
every â¢rhilepost there is a barrier and we must pay
toll before we can .pass through. â¢
It would not be fair to pronounce a hasty judgment
against the grumblers. It is natural in man to desire
to get something without paying for it,' and a ten
dency to growl when payment is required is no sign
of depravity. The grumblers/ however, should be
reasonable. We cannot have. a large increase iri the
school population without at the. same time having
an enlarged responsibility in the direction of public
education. -When the number> of school children in
crease the number of- classrooms and of â¢ teachers
must be increased. So also with the increase of the
general-population and- the upbuilding of the subur
ban districts there . inevitably comes a need for an
enlarged police force to afford protection to person
and to property. Â¦ . - â¢Â¦ â¢ .-
GRATIFICATION is felt; by all progressive

when he reads statistics showing the increase of in
dustry, commerce;and bank deposits,- and when .he
sees improvements; going on in private or in public
property, he is. delighted arid counts ; it all. as clear
gain to the community. On the. other hand, when he
learns, that along with the growth of the city -there
has come a necessity for increased expenditures he is

the Sovereign Grand Lodge use their en
deavors in that body to have repealed
that. section of the law which permits past

Past Grand Master Karl C. Brenck,
chairman' of the Grand Lodge committee
on conference, delivered an address. and
answered a number of questions on points
of law that were very Instructive.
The assembly was officially visited by
Grand Master Nicholls, who delivered a
short address and gave instructions. He
was accompanied by Grand .Warden-elect
J. W. Linscott, who spoke upon the good
work the lady members of the Rebekahs
are doing for the advancement of Odd
Fellowship.
There was introduced a resolution to
the effect that no children of Odd Fellows
would be eligible to admission In the home
until after, the parents shall have resided
in the State two years. This was dis
cussed at length and defeated.

the cornerstone of the monument erected
to the memory of Samuel H. Parker, who

trowel to the Grand Lodge. j
. The, decision of the grand master that
Rebekah lodges could not appropriate any
of its funds for the payment of the fu
neral-expenses of a. deceased sister was
reversed and it was given out that in
case a sister dies and has no to
meet the' funeral expenses the lodge of
which she was a member may appropriate
money for such prpose.

The young King who hag beerr called by the acci
dent of to rule over this discordant people is
credited with little strength, either physical or men
tals He is reported .to; be; amiable and /gentle, but
delicate and lacking in force of character or intellec
tual quickness. -The political skies that bend! above
his coronation are therefore anything but promising
to Spain. "Still it is worth while 'to remember in this
case that it is always the unexpected that happens.
It isa proverb that Â¦Â¦'threatened men live long." -Al
fonso XIII is threatened in so many ways that if the
proverb be true his reign will be one > ol the longest
and happiest in history. At any. rate he has no politi
cal enemies except in his own tfome and no personal
enemies anywhere, and so -there will -be-well - riigh
universal good wishes to greet him when he assumes
the crown and enters upon the heavy responsibilities
of sovereignty. v * . ' ; ,

WASHINGTON, May 16.â An effort was
made by Lodge of Massachusetts in the
Senate to-day to induce the minority to
fix a time when a vote might be taken on
the Philippine Government bill, but Du
bols of Idaho, speaking for the Demo
cratic side, did not desire to specify a
date for the vote. Assurances were given
that the minority was not seeking for de
lay, but wished simply that discussion
should be exhausted before the vote was
taken. . ' ',â¢;
McLaurin of Mississippi concluded hia
speech begun yesterday in opposition to
the present Philippines policy, of the Gov
ernment, which he maintained was re
sponsible for all the ills that had come to
the United States In those islands.
Deboe of Kentucky supported the pend.
ing measure in a carefully prepared
speech, maintaining that the policy out
lined by McKlnley' ought to be followed to
the end. He asserted that peace would.
come quickly when the sympathizers with
Aguinaldo ceased their attacks on tha
American army and the American flag.
The House had more lively debates to.
day, alleged. Philippine atrocities and tha
Schley case coming In for considerable at
tention. The naval appropriation bill re
ceived little attention after the more excit
ing themes of debate came up. Cannon of
Illinois and Hepburn of Iowa brought on
the discussion by criticizing the- extent to
which naval officers secured comfortablg
berths ashore, whereupon Williams o{
Mississippi made a very sarcastic speech
at the expense of Admiral Crowninshleld,
during which he read a poem describing
the late head of the Bureau of Navigation
as "the greatest tar that ever stayecj
ashore." Â¦
Williams denied the assertion of Grow;
of Pennsylvania that Philippine war
methods were slmilarto those of the Civil
War. Cochran of Missouri reinforced
Williams in this contention, "while Landis
of Indiana discussed the . resolutions
adopted by the Union Veterajis of In
diana, comparing "the copperheads of the
present day," who criticized the army la
the Philippines, with. the. copperheads ot

PERSONAL MENTION.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â The Secretary
of War. has transmitted to the Senate
Committee on the Philippines a report
made by Captain J. H. Grant, civil Gov
ernor of the province of Leyte, P. I., con
cerning differences of . understanding be
tween himself and General J. H. Smith
in regard to the control of affairs in that
province. v '-'
The, report begins with a complaint of
the arrest of several native presldentes
of villages by the military authorities.
Unfortunately for the peace and tranquil
lity of the people of this province, the
military authorities have sustained a se
vere fright since the Balangiga affair
and have done many things that are cal
culated to hinder the progress of civil
government and make the people inquire
what benefits they are to derive from
civil government. The most important of
these incidents is described by Governor
Grant as follows:
"Immediately after the receipt of the
news of the massacre at Balangiga the
military authorities began patrolling the
.town from about 8 o'clock p. m. until
next morning, challenging and . arresting
all who could not satisfy the patrol that
they were not good men. On the night
of September 30 a sentry shot and instant
ly killed a man who did not hear, or at
least. did not heed his challenge. Of course
the people do not understand why these
things should take place under civil gov
ernment."
Following this on the afternoon of the
9th Inst. orders were sent out from district
headquarters direct to the presidente, so
he says, to arrest and take to the tribunal
every man in Tacloban who came from
Sam ar. The result was that 150 men
were arrested without warrant or other
process and subjected to a kind of. ah
Investigation, which being Incompleted at
a late hour at night; quite a number of
them, were' confined until next morning,
when the investigation proceeded, and all
but six were given their liberty. He con
tinues: . ..'.', . . -7 V :
"I am informed that a detachment from
Tanapan recently fired into a. party of
laborers from Daguami, killing one and
wounding two, according to military re
ports, but I think there were more men
wounded. This happened in the daytime
and the soldiers were commanded by an
officer. From all the information obtain
able, it was purely a case of nervousness
on the part of the officer in charge."
Speaking of General Smith's achieve
ments in the islands, Captain Grant say3:
"Since General Smith has been in com
mand here there has not been' a single
surrender, to my knowledge of arms or
men, nor has there been a single cap
ture. The only thing he has accomplish
ed, to my knowledge, was the arrest of
a few men on Bill ran and along the
straits on the confession of one of Luk
ban's officers, .the truth of whose state
ments is yet to be established. All the
sensational newspaper reports that have
reached Manila from reporters traveling
with General Smith are absolutely with
out foundation and have had but one ob^-
Ject in view, the return of this province to
military control." .
Captain Grant, asserts that certain
trcops.were removed from towns In Leyte
for the purpose of bringing about mili
tary control.'

SCORES ACTS OF

DEMOCRATS ASK
FOR DISCUSSION
OF PHILIPPINES
As efforts are being made at this time to
advance; the upbuilding of; Northern California it is
interesting-' to note the excellent showing of that sec
tion of the State. It is in the counties north of
Tehachapi" that "rural industries are most varied and
â¢the. crops ,most- promising. The Promotion Com
mittee in- appealing to intelligent home-seekers
among the people of the East will need no other ar
gument in favor of; Northern California than what her
fields! orchards,' vineyards and pastures show to-day
in the way of . profitable return to every form of
rural industry, . from - the growing of grass to the
cultivation of the finest and most delicate of fruits
and berries, oils and wines.
Taken as' a whole/the reports' show in a striking way
the- advantage which. California has over any other
similar area in the world by reason of the wide diver
sity of crops produced in any particular section of her
territory. Santa Clara, for example, is noted as the
chief prune-growing; county, of the State, andithe
prune crop there isreported to be badly spotted; but
the county does not depend upon prunes only, and
her other crops promise enormous yields. So it is
all over California. Moreover, what is true of coun
ties is very largely true ! of individual orchards.
Nearly every grower has a diversified crop upon
which to depend for prosperity, and accordingly a
blight of one kind of fruit rarely ever -brings dis
tress to any considerable proportion of our people. .
So the reports, run. Each locality finds compensa
tion for a partial failure in; one crop'by profusion of
other crops, and the State at large is in no danger
of a shortage in. any important crop, because the fall
ing off in one locality is more than counterbalanced
by the abundance elsewhere.
.. It is. to be noted. that ho locality reports a prob
able falling off in all, crops, nor is there any crop in
which- even a partial . failure is reported everywhere.
Porterville, for example, reports that apricots and
peaches in that locality are dropping, while Visalia
reports; the peach crop will be enormous; .* the trees
are so heavily laden that in some orchards the grow
ers .will remove -"fully 75 per cent from the trees.
Hanford reports that Bartlett, pears will be very short
.oil account, of. the. pear blight, while Shasta announces
jthat her crop pfBartletts will be so abundant that
considerable quantities will be dried. The prune
crop appears to be more "badly "spotted" than any
other large fruit crop, and yet many localities expect
an extraordinary yield. From - Vacaville, for in
stance, the report says:. "French prunes 'and plums
are so thick that as high as $40 an acre will be ex
pended to thin them."
Of course all. the crops in all localities are not to
be absolutely perfect. From well nigh, every county
there come along with the reports of general bright
prospects statements; that this or that particular. crop
will not be full. Here and there it is noted that the
apricot crop is spotted, or the prune crop will be
lighter than was expected from the early promise of
profuse blossoming, and in one or two localities there
is felt a need of more rain. Even those statements,
however, arc riot to be taken always as bad news, for
a good many authorities declare that the falling of
the fruit will amount to hardly much more than a
wholesome-thinning and that the result will be such
an increase .uuthe quality and size of the fruit that
remains as to' fully' compensate' for the decrease in
the quantity. . .-.-Â¦' Â¦
â¢ "Whara forecast it*is!: The whole cultivated area of
the s S;tate< is glowing with "golden promise. Grass
pastures, grain fields, orchards, vineyards, befry
farms and market gardens vie with one another in the
lush profusion of premising crops. It is apparent
that taken as a whole all previous crop records are to
be broken. We are to have the most golden year of
our golden history and will. derive from our rural in
dustries a revenue that will carry prosperity to every
home that is not blighted by some special misfor
tune. ; .
REPORTS published in The Call yesterday give
- the most comprehensive summary of the crop
âprospects of the State that has' yet been pub
lished. As there is now no longer '.-"any probable dan
ger from frost except in a few localities in the moun
tains, the prospects' presented may be taken as a
fairly safe basis upon which to estimate the coming
harvests. There will be of course the usual dropping
of fruit later on," but as that is a normal phenomenon!
of the orchard industry the, effect of it ' can /be "'dis
counted with a fair degree of accuracy by experienced
orchardists. We may therefore reasonably conclude
that - the estimates furnished to The Gall, afford a
xeliable- forecast 'of the harvest that is. to come.

THE reception given by Rear Ad
miral Casey on board the United
States battleship Wisconsin Thurs
day afternoon was one of the
most enjoyable affairs of the sea
son in army and navy circles. A number
of young ladles of this city, accompanied
by their chaperones, attended, and sev
eral Presidio officers were among those
present. Mrs. Casey received the guests
with her husband. The affair was de
lightfully informal arid most of the time
was spent in dancing. Refreshments were
served in the officers' quarters. Among
the guests were:
. The prisoner has scarcely emerged from
the shadows of that terrible day when.her
father, Rev. Charles G. Adams, shot and
killed Dr. John G. Jessup at Berkeley,
/June 1$, 1901. Her suffering at the hands
of her drink-crazed father, an Episcopal
ian clergyman who had, been unfrocked
after many years of intemperance, moved
Dr. Jessup to interfere in her behalf. She
pleaded with him not to enter the room
where her father lay, but he brushed her
frail form aside and went in, pnly to re
ceive his death' wound. It was mainly the
daughter's. testimony on the witness stand
that saved the aged clergyman from a
felon's fate and tempered the verdict of
the jury so that he was adjudged insane.
He is now confined -in the Napa Insane
Asylum. â¢ ..--.
"Then you know that?" she sobbed,
when asked if she were not the daughter
of Rev. Charles G. Adams. "I had hoped
at least that my identity in this connec
tion might remain hidden, if for nothing
more than my little brother's sake. All
of my friends will now know my disgrace,
and I shall never again be able to face
them. Into this unhappy life of mine will
there never come one ray of sunshine?
More than all else I feel for the man
whom I have promised to marry. Whether
or not this terrible event will cause him
to waver in his loyalty to me I . cannot
say, but oh! I hope not. He knows me
best of all, and knowing, he may find in
his heart a pardon for this unaccountable
action' of mine." . -i -: -
Mrs. Giisen and her husband visited the
prison-. last night and expressed the great
est compassion for the prisoner. She said
she had . no intention of prosecuting the
unfortunate . girl and her only, object In
having her arrested was to secure the re
turn of the jewelry. She has aided Miss
Adams in various ways and was endeav
oring to secure her a position at the time
of the theft. Both roomed in the same
hotel and the girl was allowed access V>
Mrs. Gilsen's apartments.
Miss Adams says she has been living 1 on
allowances sent from the East by her
father's relatives. She has an uncle, W.
J. Adams, a merchant of this city, but
she says she . has never received any as
sistance from him. Her little brother, 14
years of age, is dependent upon her, and
she seems devotedly attached to him. She
was a student at the University of Cali
fornia for several years. , ;
"i don't Know wnat caused me to do it,"
she said, "it must haveDeen the f devil; I
suppose. I was not in wantâ in actual
want, that is, and I had no notion of dis
posing of the jewelry. -,Mrs. Giisen has
been more than good to me. She was my
only friend in the wnole city, and to think
that 1 should rob her. My God, to what
have I come at last!" â¢ i .
Sorrow's crown of sorrow received its
final thorn last night when Agnes Adams,
whose -entire' twenty-two years of life
have' been a thrall to misery, was locked
up in the City prison charged with grand
larceny. Impelled by an unaccountable
impulse, which she attempted. neither to
condone nor .explain, she stole from the
apartments of .aars. ' Giisen, -who lives at
lae (jiaastone, on the corner of P.olk and
kudy streets, a oiainond ring and a- brooch
valued at $iO0. ' ;"â¢ : Â¦ Â¦ .' \
She sobbingly admitted the crime as she
sat in the pribon matron's room with her
tear-staineu lace bowed in her tiny hands.

His Objections.
Two Members of the Order
Freemasons are not to the liking of
Charles R. Mains, late of Michigan and
manager of seven syndicates of capitalists
representing no less than. four billion dol
lars in gold, according to his statements.
Mains appeared for trial yesterday in the
Unitea Spates District Court on a charge
of having used the Postofflce for the pur
pose of. defrauding Dr. Charles B. Ben
nett of Wauseon, Ohio, out of $3000 by
representing that he would make .Bennett
president of the Standard- Rothchlld Oil
Company, with little work 'and much sal
ary, if Bennett would invest $3000 in the
concern. Bennett went to his banker to
draw the money, but was advised Â¦ thaf
Mains was attempting to bunko him.
Several letters were written by Mains to
Bennett, in which It was represented that
the syndicates had several million dollars
on deposit in the banks of San Francisco,
New York and Chicago.
Mains represented that "Walter Scott
Gifford was actuary of these syndicates,
and shortly after Mains' arrest Gifford
was taken in custody in Monterey County,
where he was employed in the humble ca
pacity of telegraph operator for the
Southern Pacific Company. Gilford's
statement showed that he had been an
innocent tool in tHe hands of Mains, and
the prosecution selected him as a witness
on behalf of the Government.
Mains occupied the whole of the fore
noon in the examination of two or three
talesmen. He became so wearisome that
Judge de Haven cut him short.' Kach
juryman Â¦was asked by Mains whether he
was a member of the Masonic order, and
every talesman who admitted that he be
longed to that ancient fraternity was per
emptorily challenged by the defense until
the ten peremptory challenges of the de
fendant were exhaused. - A jury was se
cured shortly before 4 p. m.
When Talesman Chesebrough Â¦was asked
whether he had formed an opinion in the
case he replied that he did not think that
any one could sit in the courtroom and
hear the defendant examine one talesman
for forty-three minutes and not form
some impression.
Postoffice Inspector "W. A. Robinson,
who had simply performed his sworn duty
by presenting Mains!, letters before the
Grand Jury, was denounced by Mains as
"a star swearer." When C. S. Benedict,
clothing merchant, was asked by Mains
whether he knew Robinson, Benedict re
plied, "HÂ« is one of my oldest and best
friends, and any statement that W. A.
P.cbinson might make I would absolutely
believe, whether he was under oath or
not." Benedict admitted that he was a
member of all the Masonic bodies and of
the Odd Fellows, "and two or three oth
ers." He was peremptorily challenged.
In the afternoon John J. Jury examined
the talesmen on behalf of the defense and
saved his client from being convicted be
fore the jury had been impaneled.- There
are two Masons and an Elk on the jury.
The taking of testimony will begin at
11 o'clock on Monday morning.

TIRED SALESWOMEH.
Employers Should be More^Oonsid-
erate. V Mrs. Pinkhapa Asks Tired
Women to Write Her f or Advicej
- In the vast retail establishments, of large cities, many -women aid
employed as saleswomen.
; Men formerly held the positions, that "vromen *nowiiold, and while
women's organism is less strong than men's, they are expected to do the
same work. Their duties compel them to be on their feet from morning
to night, and many of them, in a short time, contract those distressing
complaints called "female diseases." , T*^
Then occur irregularities, suppressed or painful menstruation,
weakness, indigestion, leucorrhcea, general debility, and nervous pros-
tration. \ " ' .''T^- ;-â¢: Y
They are beset with such symptoms as dizziness, faintness, lassi-
tude, excitability, irritability, nervousnesSj sleeplessness, melancholy,
"all-gone " and "want-to-be-left-alone " feehngs, blues, and hopelessness.
- In such cases there is one tried and true remedy. ILydla E. JE*iui:-
ham's Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles. The
following tetters prove this. They also prove the value of Mrs. Rnfc
ham's aavice. , * '
"I Can Work Every Day in the Week Now."
"Dkab Mm. Pctkham:â I write this letter lor you to publish for the-
benefit of poor, sufferin? women, lijdla. E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound has done me a great deal of rood. I ha.ro taken, three bottles and feel

almost crazy, had those bearing-down pains, and stomach was out of order.
Now all of these' troubles hare left me and I can work eTery day in the week

N.J. -'(March 8, 1901.)
No other medicine in the world has received such widespread and
unqualified endorsement.;'; :>
No other, person can give such helping advice to women who
are sick as can Mrs. Plnkham, for none have had such a great

VALLEJO, May 16.â The discovery was
made this morning by a roundsman on the
navy yard that an attempt had been made
to fire the lumbershed . south of - the dry
dock. Wood had been saturated with oil
and laid against a lumber pile. A match
had been applied and ! the kindling con
sumed, but the lumber failed to ignite.
This was owing to the fact that it was
lumber designed for shipment and had
been dressed to prevent ignition. Had the
attempt succeeded a tremendous confla
gration would have ensued.

LOS ANGELES, May 16.â Professor A.
H. Heber of the Imperial Land Company
was in Los Angeles to-day from San
Francisco, where he had just concluded
arrangements with the Southern Pacific
Railroad for building a branch line of
railroad to Imperial and through the com
pany's lands to Calexlco, on the Mexican
border. Surveys for the road are made
and between seven and eight miles of the
grade built. This work was done by
the Imperial people before the Southern
Pacific Company became interested in the
colony In the south end of the State.
The contract that was made this week
Â¦with President E. H. Harriman of the
Southern Pacific is for rebuilding tnat
portion of the grade already made, which
will be improved and raised about four
feet, and for the completion of the grade
to the town of Imperial. The Southern
Pacific will lay the rails and equip the
road. All the work must be done and the
road placed in operation by September!.
After the killing the bodies were dls
memberpd, rolled in blankets and placed
in a hollowed rock, where they were
burned. After being burned all of the
bones were broken into small pieces with
two hardwood sticks and a large, round
Btone, like a cannon ball. The murderers
went back to the scene of the shooting
and obtained packbags from the pack
hcrse. They burned the place where Doyle
and Dalke had been slain and where their
blood was and also the big log on which
the bodies had been placed for dismem
berment. They went back to the creek
with the packbags, gathered up all they
could of the remains and put them in the
bags to carry away and conceal. It Is
presumed the horse got away from them.

Ij2zie Lehrke, sister of the groom. Con
Murray of Nicasio will act as best man.
After the wedding Mr. Lehrke and his
bride leave for an extended trip
through the southern portion of the State.
On Decoration day the Santa Cruz team
will pay its first visit of the season to
this city and will play against the Pacific
eleven. On Saturday, May 31, and Sun
day, June 1. the visitors from the sea
shore will meet last year's champions. -
The Pacific team having defeated the
Alameda eleven in the first game of the
season by a narrow margin, to-morrow's
contest will be of considerable interest.
At a recent meeting of the California
Cricket Association It ' was decided that
scores made ' In pennant matches only
should be reckoned in making Â¦ up the
batting and bowling averages for the
present season. Pennant matches are the
only games included in the schedule,
and other matches vary more In their
conditions. In previous years some have
desired to include in the averages the re
sults of all matches played with the sanc
tion of the California Cricket Association,
while others have wished to exclude
matches played on trips to Lake County,
the Citrus colony and elsewhere. In out
side matches like these circumstances are
sometimes specially favorable to bowlers
and at other times to batsmen. Matches
such as banks and insurance men versus
all others, Australia versus the world.
Young America versus Old England, mar
ried versus single, and so on are played
to keep interest up in cricket, and in
them the players are not representing
their clubs. The adoption of the practice
of reckoning pennant matches only will
remove all ground for difference of opin
ion as to what matches should be includ
ed and what excluded.
The Alameda eleven will be selected
from the following: Arthur Dickenson,
A. E. J. Chivers. G. H. Ward, Harry
Bird. B. Bird, F. J. Croll, A. F. Stahl, W.
G. Fortmann, C. Banner, A. S. Willis, A.
Price, W. J. Richter, H. Ward Sr. and H.
W. Brown.
The second cricket match of the sea
son will take place to-morrow on the
ground at Webster street, Alameda, be
tween the Pacific and Alameda clubs. The
Pacific representatives will be H. C. Cas
idy (captain), C. P. Coles. A.' W. Wild

At least 100 men will be affected at the
outset, but should the building trades
make a fight of it there will be a general
tie-up in all the building lines. There are
more than sixty sub-contractors in the
association. . . .
Recently the Sub-contractors' Associa
tion adopted a resolution declaring that
any union painter who accepted work
fiom any owner of buildings or other
non-member of the association could not
expect to obtain further employment
from members of the association. The
Painters' Union protested that this;, de
cision was unjust, claiming that a paint
er should be allowed to accept work from
any man willing to pay union wages and
recognize union rules and hours or" labor.
Following this protest, the union painters
assert, a boss grainer, who was a mem
ber of the Sub-contractors' Association,
was directed to take the place of a grain
er belonging to the Painters' Union. The
painters regarded this as a slap at them,
and relations became so strained that they
finally considered that they had been put
on the "unfair list" by the Sub-contract
ors' Association and quit work.
. At this point the Building Trades Coun
cil, which practically embraces all of the
unions engaged in the various branches of
building, stepped into the breach as a de
fender of the painters. The Sub-contract
ors' Association requested the Building
Trades Council to order the painters back
to work by 1 o'clock this afternoon, but no
attention was paid to the request. To
night the sub-contractors decided to dis
charge all union men in their employ to
morrow.
SACRAMENTO, May 16.-Trouble be
tween the Sub-contractors' Association of
this city and the members of the score of
unions from which the association engages
labor was precipitated by the action . of
the association to-night in deciding to
discharge all union men to-morrow, pend
ing a settlement of existing difficulties.
The oraer is likely to bring on a severe
conflict, as both sides are powerful. Much
building is in progress here at present,
and to-morrow there will be a general
suspension of work.
Si>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
The story of Mrs. Klein's troubles is
a sad one. The woman was conducting
a restaurant business in St. Louis and
had accumulated a few thousand dollars.
A few weeks ago she gave employment to
a young waiter named Charles MarÂ«o.
Ehe fell in love with him and marriage
was agreed upon. Marco prevailed upon
her to send him to San Francisco to look
over the field for a chance to invest her
money. Immediately after his arrival he
telegraphed to her advising her to dis
pose of her business and join him.
Mrs. Klein came to the city and took
rooms at Mrs. Majors'. Her money pos
sessions amounted to $6800, which with
some jewelry she kept between the mat
tresses of her bed. On Monday after
noon last Marco, in returning to the
house, saw Mrs. Klein In another room
with the landlady. He made an excuse
to visit the sleeping-room, and as he did
not return Mrs. Klein went to Investi
gate. She found the bed in a disordered
condition and her money and jewelry
missing. Since them Marco has not been
seen. The police were notified, but so far
have been unable to learn of his where
abouts.
Mrs. Klein says she feels satisfied that
Ehe can easily convince the Commission
ers of her sanity. Regarding her future
she says she Is anxious and willing: to
earn a living and try to forget her mis
fortune.
Mary Klein, the elderly St. Louis widow
who was robbed of J6S00 in this city a
few days ago by a young waiter who she
expected to marry, was locked up in the
detention ward of the Central Kmergency
Hospital last night, pending an examina
tion as to her sanity.
. Early last night a telephone call was
received at the hospital from Mrs. Major
of 14ti Eddy street, at whose house Mrs.
Klein has been stopping, stating that she
desired to have a Hysterical woman re
moved from the house. A steward was
sent on the case, but as Mrs. Klein re
fused to be taken from her room and as
her condition did not warrant her re
moval, she was not disturbed.
The landlady, however, reported the
matter to the police. She said that Mrs.
KJein had been violent and had acted
in a manner that made her believe Mrs.
Klein contemplated suicide. Upon Mrs.
Major's promise to swear to a complaint
charging her with insanity the police re
moved Mrs. Klein to the Detention Hos
pitaL
When Questioned at the hospital Mrs.
Klein, far from showing any symptoms
of hysteria or of Insanity, talked in a
Quiet and rational manner. She declared
that Mrs. Majors, knowing that she was
temporarily without means, desired to
get rid of her and had resorted to un
pleasant methods. Since her troubles had
been told in the- newspapers, Mrs. KJein
says, small sums have been sent to her
by charitable persons and alleges that
Mrs. Majors has held them for her cwn
use.

President Roosevelt replied, Thursday,
May 15, thanking Emperor William heart
ily in the name of the United States and
saying he would, lay the matter \ before
Congress immediately. President Roose
velt's reply, which was sent in German,
is translated as follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 15.
Emperor William, Wiesbaden: 1 highly ap
preciate your great, friendly offer. I thank you
heartily therefor in the name of the United
States. I will submit it Immediately to Con
gress. It will, no doubt, be to the great pleas
ure of our people to receive from your hands
a statue of the famous ruler and soldier, one
of the greatest men of all times, Frederick the
Great, and it is especially appropriate that the
statue should be erected in the city of Wash
ington, the capital of the republic, upon the
birth of which he. looked with such friendly
interest. ..."
For this new proof of Â¦ your friendly feelings
toward our country I thank you in the name ot
the United States. Your, gift will surely be
considered here as a new evidence of the friend
ship existing between the two nations. We
hope and believe that this friendship in the
coming years will j become still stronger. It is
a hopeful sign for the welfare of all mankind
that in the beginning- of the century the Ameri
can and German people are working together in
a sense of happy friendship.
I am' still under the deep Impression created
by the splendid and cordial reception of my
brother, Prince Henry, by the citizens of the
United States of America. In speeches with
which he. was greeted the fact was often men
tioned that my ancestor, Frederick the Great,
maintained a friendly attitude toward the young
American republic during the course or her
formation, thereby laying the cornerstone of
the friendly relations which have always ex
isted between our two countries.
The example set to me. by the great King I
intend to follow. I wish to commemorate the
visit of Prince Henry by a gift to the people
of America, which I request you to accept in
their name. I intend to present a statue, in

WIESBADEN, Hesse-Nassau, May 16.â
The German Emperor on Wednesday, May
14/ telegraphed as follows to the President
of the .United States at Washington:
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, May 16.â According
to news brought by the Miowera to-day,
efforts are being made in New Zealand to
have the proposed American Pacific cable
connect with the British cable at Fanning
Island. The proposal came from Mr.'Dick
inson, engineer for the Commercial Pa
cific Cable Company, and was made to the
New Zealand Government. In all inter
view given at Wellington, N. Z., before
the Miowera left, Sir Joseph Ward of.
New Zealand said that as far as his Gov
ernment was concerned it would look with
favor on the proposal. It' is, however,
doubtful, if Australia and Canada, who
are large sharers in the cost of the Brit
ish ' cable, would accede to the arrange
ment. At the " time the Miowera sailed
from Honolulu, Dickinson wa3 there, en
gaged in locating a site for the landing of
the American cable. . \
Among the Mlowera's passengers were
Messrs. Lucas and Taylor of the Pacific
cable board, who are on their way to
London to Join the cable ship Colonia,
shortly to leave there for Victoria to com
mence , laying the Canadian end of the
cable. They left the cable ship Anglla at
Suva after having completed the cable
from Brisbane to that point. About .2300
miles of cable were laid and during tne
work the Anglia was tossed by a heavy
cyclone which rendered the work double
difficult. â¢ The Anglia is now en route
from Suva to London for a fresh supply
of cable.

SAN JUAN, P. K., May 16.â As a result
of a clash between Las Turbas and mem

were cut or beaten, but there was no loss
Las Turbas ("the mob") is a political
organization which is in the habit of or
ganizing attacks on its political enemies.
Parties of soldiers from the West In
dian (colored) regiment made a sortie
from the camp and attacked people in the
streets with razors lashed to sticks. The
civilians used nail-studded clubs. Numbers
on both sides were injured. The riot was
quelled by military pickets and the police.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 16.â A riot
occurred here last night between soldiers
and civilians, in which twenty of the pop

The Kind of Work Done by
PAINE'S CELERY
COMPOUND
Mrs. Mary Hickey, of South Sodna,
N. Y., Had Rheumatism
So Bad She Conld Not Walk.
Had to Be Wheeled Ahont the
House in an Invaid's
Chair.
The Use of the Never-Dis-
appointing Rheumatism
Banisher Cured Her.
True merit, prompt and effective re-
sults, and astonishing cures have given
Paine's Celery Compound a position on
the highest round of the ladder of fame.
Paine's Celery Compound 13 to-day the
only spring medicine asked for and
bought by thoughtful and discerning peo-
ple. For the treatment of serious dis-
eases, such as rheumatism, neuralgia, ner-
vous disorders and blood troubles, Paine's
Celery Compound has no equal.
The credit of Paine's Celery Compound
has advanced to such a high eminence
that among- the millions who use it we
find the names of millionaires, bankers,
; professional men, -wealthy merchants and
women of note. ' All have made it their
chosen remedy for the cure of chronic
diseases and for the banishment of the
little ailments that often make life miser-
able.
Paine's Celery Compound, in the opin-
ion of the leading druggists and physi-
cians, has displaced nearly all the com-
mon advertised medicines of the day. This
great work has been accomplished only
by merit and genuine cures. Rheumatism,
neuralgia and nervous disorders take
flight in springtime when Paine's Celery
Compound Is used for a time. Why delay
the work of health building when such
a life-sriver Is within your reach? Test
its efficacy this very day.
Mrs. Hickey, happy and grateful for the
astonishing results derived from Paine's
Celery Compound, new nerve fiber, nerve
force, fresh energy and vitality, writes
us:
"For nearly thirty years I have beeiÂ« an
invalid, caused by that terrible disease,
rheumatism. For six years I could not
walk without the help of friends. All
my joints were stiff, and I had to be
wheeled about the house in an invalid's
chair. Physicians' medicines,' baths, etc.,
were all in vain, but Paine's Celery Com-
pound practically cured me, and I am
i now able to walk around and do my
housework." . "_ '

Pope and Lumbard got the first setâ 8-6.
In the second' set the Sacramento team
kept up Its steady gait and won by a
score of 6-3. Everything seemed to be go-
Ing Sacramento's way in the third set,
but the Porter brothers steadied down and
won outâ 6-4. The next two sets also went
to the Woodland men, thus giving them
the Noack trophy for the second time.
The match was very close throughout and
one of the best ever played for the North

Unfortunate Wooing of Ezekiel House
Leads to Much Liti
gation.
SAN JOSE, May 16.â The story of court
ship and troubles of Mrs. C. A. Warthen
and Kzeklel House, well-known residents
near' Gllroy, is recalled by an answer filed
in an ejectment suit in the Superior Court
to-day. They live near each other and a
few years ago were engaged to be mar
ried. In his ardent wooing House deeded
his home to Mrs. Warthen. . The place
consists of forty acres and is worth about
$6000. They quarreled before the wedding
day. Mrs. Warthen then brought suit to
eject House from- the place. He fought
the case and claimed the deed was only
conditional on her agreement to marry
and as she had failed to do so he asked
that' the instrument be set aside. Now
Mrs. Warthen claims that the deed wad
absolute and that the land Is no more
than of sufficient value to serve as a balm
for the trifling with her affections. Each
blames the other for the disruption in
their , love : affair. Both have been mar
ried and have families of children.
A conference meeting of the labor
unions, to make final preparations for at
tending the Irish Fair, will be held to
morrow forenoon at 10 o'clock at Metro
politan HaU. -^ctro
Notwithstanding the many counter at
tractions, the art gallery, where many
famous paintings are on exhibition; the
I'.useum, with its collection of wonderful
freaks, and the map of Ireland, where one
can 6tudy the topography of the Emerald
Isle, were well patronized.
Limerick and Monaghan booths, which
are two of the most popular booths at the
lair, also rendered very enjoyable pro
grammes, which attracted large crowds.
Their programmes consisted of dances
ynd vocal and instrumental music.
Before the programme was begun, how
ever, the club, with about 500 members in
Cne, and with fifty couples dressed in
Â¦white in the vanguard, paraded about the
iiall, making a pretty spectacle.
The feature of last night's programme
at the Irish Fair was the very picturesque
entertainment given by the Gaelic Danc
ing Club. Since the commencement of the
lair the Irish Dance Hall which is under
the management of this club has proved
troet popular. Every night the hall has
been crowded with visitors desiring to see
the Irish jigs and reels executed by the
graceful dancers in costume. Last night
the dancing club held its programme of
dances on the platform on the main floor

Attorney Collins contended that the
evidence was insufficient to warrant the
holding of the defendant, and he also
cited authorities to show that the plead*
ings in the case were improperly drawn.
Collins reviewed the testimony taken in
the Police Court, and said that Lauder
bach, a Post-street merchant, who is the
prosecution's principal- witness, was un*
able to say that Hansted committed the
assault, or that the two men Hansted
was talking to before the occurrence beat
Garrett. He also, said that Witness
Markus testified. in the Police Court that
he saw Hansted prevent the men from
Inflicting further injury on Garrett.
In replying Attorney Dunne cited many
cases to prove that the pleadings were
perfect, and argued that there was suf
ficient evidence to hold Hansted.
Fred Hansted, the alleged assailant of
Thomas Garrett, appeared before Judge
Sloss yesterday seeking release on a writ
of habeas corpus. Peter F. Dunne, spe
cial prosecutor employed by Garrett, and
Attorney George D. Collins, representing
Hansted, argued at length, after which
Judge Sloss took the case under advise
ment. â¢ . â¢

It- is not shown that defendants compelled
the manufacturers of malt in this city toagree
to refuse, tp sell malt to any obe not a member
of the Brewers' Protective Association or that
the manufacturers of malt did make any such
agreement. The purpose of the acts of the
Brewers' ' Association appears, to . have been
merely a' desire to prevent the plaintiff -from
selling beer at a price less than the price at
which the. defendants iwere.: selling,' not tosruln
plaintiff or to compel It to abide by all the
terms of the agreement of June ' 24. "Without
considering the question whether. In this State
an act in itself lawful can 'become- unlawful
because done by the combination of two or
more persons, in, pursuance of an illegal .pur
pose. I think the effort by one engaged in a
certain line of trade to prevent the continuance
in such trade of another who is carrying on
business in a manner deemed by the flrat to be
detrimental to him is not ' the . pursuit of ' an
unlawful purpose.
In his decision Judge Sloss says:
Judge Sloss decided yesterday that the
Brewers' Protective Association has not
conspired against the Columbia Brewing
Company for the purpose of ruining the
business of the firm named. The .brew
ing company brought suit against the as
sociation for an injunction . restraining
the association from compelling the malt
sters of this city to refuse furnishing th&
plaintiff with/the wherewithal to make
beer., A conspiracy on' the part of .the
members of the association was alleged.
When Clerc reached Morne Rouge, dis
tant from. St. Pierre about six miles 'he
looked back and to his horror saw a
huge mass of slate colored stones and
ashes burst from Mont Pelee and tumble
down on St. Pierre. This was immediate
ly followed by a great wall of flame,
which seemed to rise and topple over on
the doomed town. The whole thing lasted
not more than two minutes. So sharply
defined was the wall of flame that a bull
caught on the edge of Its track was
roasted to a crisp on one side and not a
hair of the animal was singed on the
other.
As Clerc and his family were leaving St.
Pierre he saw Mr. Prentis, the American
Consul, standing in front of his house
with Mrs. Prentis. Mr. Clerc called out
to Prentis, and warned him to flee the
city at once, but the Consul only laughed
and waved his hand as he answered:
"Oh, there is no dauger. Don't be afraid."
pany with Ferdinand Clerc, a mil
lionaire and the Mayor of Trinite, I trav
eled to-day sixty miles through the north
ernand eastern part of Martinique. We
journeyed in carriages and had relays of
horses. .We are the first people from Fort
de France in this district since the erup
tion of Mont Pelee. I am now at Ste
Marie, forty-five kilometers (about twen
ty-eight miles) north of Fort de France.
All day long we met refugees making
their way toward Fort de France. They
were all filled with terror lest Mont Pelee
again pour out a death-dealing avalanche
of fire, or some new eruption take place
from what are now inactive volcanoes.
Mayor Clerc is the only person I have
been able to find who was in St. Pierre on
the morning the city was overwhelmed,
saw the eruption and lived to tell the tale.
He tells me that at 7 o'clock on the morn
ing of May 8 he noticed the rumblings
from Mont Pelee were more pronounced
than they had been up to that time. The
barometer in his house fluttered violently,
and he at once ordered his servants* to
harness mules to his carriages and pre
pare for flight. Clerc took his wife and
four children with him and hastened from
the city. He advised all his friends to
hasten away also, but his advice was dis
regarded by them. He left behind him at
his house twenty-eight of his friends who
had gathered there at his call and whom
he advised to get away as quickly as they
could.
m TEW YORK, May 16.â A World spe
/V( cial from Ste. Marie, Martinique,
â¢*â¢ " via Fort de France, says: In com-
Carpenters' Union No.: 22 met at 1133
Mission street last night, but aside from
an informal discussion of the situation
nothing of importance was done. In
quiries for information were met with
the response that there was nothing to
make public.
.The Labor Council, with which -the
brotherhood unions are affiliated, met last
night, but contrary to expectation no ac
ticn as to the quarrel of the carpenters
was' taken. This is regarded as an indi
cation that the council is satisfied with
the situation . and that no necessity for
action in the premises at this time exists.
The brotherhood -carpenters* are- now
confident of winning their fight, and say
that the situation has passed the acute
stage. It is believed that a compromise
will be effected and that the Build
ing Trades Council will be the ' first to
quit. The agents of that body have re
ported to their chief tha.t the orders to
men to quit are being generally ignored
now that the contractors have clearly
defined their position in the fight. So long
as it was possible to secure the co-opera
tion of the contractors the McCarthy men
felt certain of winning, but now that this
has been refused, the situation as far as
the council is concerned is without hope.
The refusal of the contractors to dis
criminate against the brotherhood car
penters in favor of those affiliated with
the Building Trades Council has proved
a serious blow to President McCarthy's
forces. It was reported last night that
many of McCarthy's supporters in his
fight against the brotherhood are desert
ing to the enemy, and that a general
stampede is looked for at an early date.

Sergeant Green discovered the gang on
the ark, and Night Captain Walter J.
Petersen made the raid that resulted in
the capture. It was to Captain Petersen
that the men first confessed.
The prisoners say that Belden was cool,
and grave up what money he had when
the pistol was put in his face, though he
tried to get a look at his despoilers. They
fay that Blodgett, who was robbed by
them later, was very nervous and talked
a great deal. They will probably be ar
raigned to-morrow. As their confessions
are in writing, it will take but a short
time to land them in prison. Both of the
men had served in the Marine Corps of
the United States.
The old ark at the foot of Alice street
was to be their refuge in the daytime, and
at night they were to make raids into
the Lakeside district.
Since confessing the prisoners talk quite
freely of their plans, which were more
elaborate than those of the average foot
pad. This is probably due to the fact
that the men possess more than the aver
age amount of intelligence. The robbery
of Belden was their first work, so that
they went about it with more than usual
care.
They commenced operations on Daniel
F. Belden, general agent fer the Hart
ford Fire Insurance Company in San
Francisco. Belden was the victim of a
most exciting experience a few years ago,
when he was called down to his front
door at midnight only to be hit with an
ax in the hands of some stranger who
was never discovered. "The Man With
the Ax" was sought for unsuccessfully,
and the incident was forgotten until Bel
den was held up by the enterprising ex
soldiers.
OAKLAND, May 16.â Walter T. Bald
win and James McCoy, the ex-soldiers
who confessed yesterday to three hold
ups, were very fastidious highwaymen.
They started to work the Lakeside dis
trict, and but for their prompt arrest the
residents of that exclusive and badly
lighted section of town would have suffer
ed badly. They had planned to only raid
the fashionable section of town.

Nerve He Shows When They
Hold Him Up.

"Midsummer Night's D-ream." This took
place, on a barge anchored near the shore.

splendid talent, and their ludicrous antics
and droll remarks were received with ap
plause and laughter. CD. McComish '03

Special. Dispatch to The Call.
It was stated this afternoon that the
Provincial Government had instructed
Judge Lafontalne to obey the writ of
habeas corpus, but the Judge says that
all he knows about the case is that he
issued a warrant and that the men called
for in that document were produced be
fore him. He had remanded the prisoners
until Monday morning and expected that
they would again be produced before
him. Legal opinion in Montreal is that
habeas corpus proceedings cannot be In
stituted until Judge Lafontaine has de
cided the case. Then if he commits them
for extradition proceedings of that nature
will be in order.
The jurisdiction of an extradition com
missioner, extends over the entire domin
ion, and the arrests of Greene and Gay
nor were made by an officer qualified to
make arrests in any portion of the pro
vince, consequently there. Is no doubt that
they will hold. This evening Mrs. Gaynor
arrived from Quebec, accompanied by
counsel for the prisoners, who had a con
sultation with them i at the Windsor.
He consulted his counsel and was in
formed that if he attempted to return the
prisoners to Quebec he would be liable
to arrest for contempt of the local court,
whose mandate he had received and ac
knowledged. So an answer setting forth
the facts in the matter was prepared and
sent down to Quebec and. with that it is
expected the Quebec people will havo to
remain satisfied.
In the meantime Constable Gale of Que
bec, with a writ' of habeas corpus, was
searching diligently for Carpenter. At 10
o'clock he found him in his office and
served the writ. Carpenter was placed in
a dilemma. He was in possession of a
document calling upon him . to produce
the bodies of Gaynor and Greene before
Judge Andrews in Quebec to-day, and he
no longer had the prisoners in his posses
sion, having been relieved by Judge La
fontaine. "
Chief Carpenter took his prisoners to
Judge Lafontaine's residence and an im
promptu court was convened in tho
Judge's library. Carpenter handed his
prisoners over to the Judge, and the lat
ter, after remanding them for examina
tion on Monday, committed them to the
care of two detectives, with permission
to reside at the Windsor.
MONTREAL, May 16.â Gaynor and
Greene are guests at the Windsor Hotel,
each guarded by a local detective, with a
force of United States Secret service
agents unofficially "in reserve. They will
not go back to Quebec, much as they and
their friends desire it, and in spite of the
writ of habeas corpus granted yesterday
by Judge Andrews of Quebec directing
Chief Detective Carpenter to return his
prisoners to that city. When the Spray
arrived in Montreal this morning the par
ty drove to the Windsor. At 7 o'clock
tney again left the hotel, just as the pur
suing force from Quebec, which had' come
up from Sorel on the Quebec boat,
reached the hotel. â¢ .
Judge Ogden took the ground that Dar
gie. simply because he might have ac
cepted moneys, from the "Enquirer, was
not necessarily a defendant, and he re
fused to order him included as such. He
thought that the complaint In regard to
Dargie might be strengthened by making
an express allegation that there was no
consideration for the money given to the
editor, but he did not insist upon it.
One other point argued was that in re
gard to the charge of collusion between
J. B. Lanktree and Assessor Dalton,
whereby the last named received money
in advance on county printing. Judge
Ogden held that there was no specific
charge of fraud here. No decision was
.given, and the whole matter went over to
be submitted on briefs.
Argument on the demurrers interpose!
to D. Edward Collins' complaint against
the members of the Oakland Enquirer
Publishing Company was freshened up a
bit to-day by a demand by the defend
ants that another defendant be tacked to
the list to share the burdens of the de
fense. These importunate defendants
urged that W. E. Dargie, editor of the
Oakland Tribune, be made a defendant
with them in their trial with the banker
and the law. Judge Ogden, however, was
not impressed with the logic of their ar
gument, and directed that things go on
in the even tenor that has characterized
the course of the case so far.
The argument of the defendants' attor
neys was based on a specification in their
demurrer that there is a "defect of par
ties defendant" in the complaint. That,
they explained, meant that Dargie, hav
ing been charged by Collins with concoct
ing a combination on city printing with
the Enquirer corporation and sharing In
the profits of that alliance, should be in
corporated as a defendant in the suit.

At an early hour tWs morning a report
was received from Engine Company No
2 to the effect that Firemen Conlon and
Mitchell only suffered bruises and a shak
ing up by their unexpected fall.
The shacks were owned by a man
me< i iwM llips ; Th Â£ y were uninsured
and of little value. The occupants of the
houses that were destroyed were Mr. and
M ff. Goldstein, 211% Ellis street, custom
tailoring establishment, loss COO, unin
sured; Julius Sichel, owner of a carpen
ter shop at 211 Ellis street, loss $1000, un
insured; Newton's coal yard, Ios3 un
known. Three horses were destroyed and
the contents of the building burned. New
ton carried some insurance. '
Next door to the coal yard was a small
chophouse known as the Central. The
damage to this place was very slight. Up
stairs was occupied by Mrs. Montigo and
the Valorine Cleaning Company. The Ios3
to these people was complete. Although
there was no insurance on the personal
effects, the loss was less than $300
Sparks ignited a deserted building In the
rear of 125 Mason street, " but the blaze
was extinguished in Its incipiency.
Morris Hepstein. a friend of Mr. Gold
stein, the tailor who lived at 211^4 Ellis
street, said that when ha detected the
smoke he Jumped out of the doorway and
looked through a window into the cellar
â¢and saw a blaze far in the rear of the
structure. He said while standing in
front of the burning building he saw a
man rush across the street with a child
in hia arms. This child, he believes be
lon/.ed to Mrs. Montigo, who lived next
door.
Levy stated that the fire started in th 9
coal yard. He saw a slight blaze in a bale
of hay In the rear of the stable and saya
It burst Into a big flame within a few
minutes.
Mrs. Pauline Goldstein and her hus-
d '^. ho lived In back ot a store at
2UÂ«4 Ellis street, were also awakened by
the crackling of flames and the odor ot
fire. Mr. Goldstein hurriedly moved his
belongings to the sidewalk, but stated he
had lost a lot of things and lamented the
fact that he carried no insurance.
Micke Levy, the Orpheum Theater
ticket collector, and a young man named
Howard Phlllpps were passing Newton's
coal yard when the fire broke out. Their
first thought was to save the horses in
the rear, and they broke m the door and
led two of the frightened animals out.
They attempted to return for the other
animals, but were driven back by the
smoke. Three horses are said to hava
been lost.
Mrs. Montigo and her young son Hubert
were asleep at 2U7 Ellis street, and but
for the timely arrival of the firemen botfc
might have been burned to death. Mrs.
Montigo was awakened by tho firemen
and escorted across the street to a neigh
bor's home. The property was uninsured,
and she lost everything. For a time shÂ»
was disconsolate, as she thought her
bank book that recorded her savings had
beetn destroyed; but thi3 was later re
stored to her.
Although of short duration, the fire was*
full of Incidents. William Conlon and
John Mitchell, members of Engine Com
pany No. 2, were badly injured while
lighting the blaze from the rear. They
were handling a hose on a balcony of an
abandoned house in the rear when it
gave way beneath their combined weight,
precipitating them to the ground, which
was fully eighteen feet below. Comrades
instantly cared for the unfortunate men,
and they were hurried to their engine
house and treated for their injuries by
Dr. Bodkin.
Within a few minutes after the blaze
was discovered in Levl Newton's coal
yard at 209 Ellis street the fire was at its
height The sky waa lit up and thousands
hurried to the scene and blockaded the
path of the firemen. The excitement was
intense. Streams of water were poured
into the rookeries from every side, and
within half an hour the conflagration wa3
under control.
. What threatened to be a disastrous ,flrÂ»
broke out in a number of old shacks on
Ellis street, above Mason, at 12:30 o'clock
this morning. Two alarms were turned
in from box 113. It was due to the prompt
work .of the splendidly organized depart
ment that a serious conflagration was
averted. For a time the Langham Hotel
on the corner of Ellis and Mason streets
was menaced. A heavy wind was blowing
and large, firebrands and sparks were
wafted toward the big structure.
W. A. Beasly acted as chairman. Ad
dresses were made, by Frank H. Benson.
Thomas Westoby (secretary of the City
Front Federation of San Francisco),
Judge Lawrence Archer and G. D. Wors
wick, the citizens' nominee for Mayor.
The meeting was then announced closed,
but the audience refused to leave and
demanded more speaking. Judge M. H.
Hyland and J. R. Lewis addressed the as
semblage. The speakers all predicted a
sweeping victory for the citizens' nom
inees. >- â¢
The biggest political mass-meeting ever
held in San Jose was that of this evening
in the Auditorium in the interests of the
citizens' municipal ticket. It was held
under the auspices of the Independent
Club. More than 2500 persons crowded the
big structure and about one thousand were
turned away, unable to gain admittance.
"We are better organized and stronger
than last year," was his parting remark,
"and are still doing quiet and effective
work from the' old stand.".
BEFORMERS' CLOSING \ RAiLLY.
John D. Mackenzie, who has control of
the machine that has dominated politics
in San Jose so long, declares that the op
position has not yet won the fight. He
says he is absolutely certain his entire
ticket, from Greeninger down, will be
elected by majorities of from 700 to 900.
Last year he won by 584 votes, and Mac
kenzie declares his organization is now
much stronger. But few desertions have
occurred from his" ranks, the Harbor
Commissioner says, and for each one he
lost he claims to have gained five. . - .
I confidently expect the end will come to
Mackenzieism and push domination in San Jose
next Monday. I sincerely believe our ticket,
headed by George D. Worswick, will be elected
from top to bottom by big majorities. We have
a splendid organization, and hundreds of citi
zens are spending their time and working earn
estly in the cause of decency, and we do not
expect the efforts of the people will relax until
the night of election. The contest has been a
bitter one and the efforts of the push most per
sistent and unflagging. We are confident the
majority will be large for Worswick, reaching
probably 1000. In the contest one never hears
of politicsâ Republicanism and Democracy are
never mentioned â but our forces, which include
old soldiers. Republicans, Democrats and Pop
ulists,' are earnestly working together to re
deem San Jose from the stigma that has rested
upon it so long. Worswick Clubs have been or
ganized in every precinct and the frequent
meetings being held are Jammed with voters
anxious to attest their loyalty to the cause of
good government. On the other hand not a
single club has been organized In behalf of the
push ticket. Their canvass has been conducted
from' the notorious California Club as head
quarters. We are all cheered and encouraged
by the thought that the day of deliverance from
boss rule is at hand.
E. A. Hayes, the president of the Re
publican Good Government League, and
who is directing the fight of the reform
forces, is more sanguine than ever of
winning the election. 'In summing up
to-day he said:'
RIVAL LEADERS CONFIDENT.
The campaign just closing has been cne
of the most bitter in the history of the
city. The charges made against Andrew
S. Mackenzie and the other Police Com
missioners by H. E. Miller, that black
mail and extortion were levied for politi
cal purposes, have been aired and used
in the campaign.
Against Mackenzie are the Herald and
Mercury, both influential papers, and day
after day they are pouring "hot shot"
into his camp. Many of his .former
workers have turned on him, but Mac
kenzie, from his rooms in the California
Club, is doing hard campaigning.
James W. Rea and his forces also are
after Mackenzie's scalp, and they are
working night and day to defeat him.
Never before has money been so plenti
ful. Rea alone has wagered about $7500
that Worswick will be elected Mayor and
has got more 'money to place.
SAN.JOSE, May 16.-San Jose is in the
throes of the hottest city campaign it
has ever known, and two great forces
are lined up for N a battle of ballots on
Monday. E. A. Hayes and John D. Mac
kenzie are the commanding generals. For
the past month both sides have been hard
at work, and with the Worswick rally to
night both practically closed their public
meetings. George D." Worswick is the
standard-bearer of the reform forces and
Adolph Greeninger carries the banner for
MacKenzie. . While the voters are rally
ing around these men, the real question
is whether the people shall have a reform
government or whether things shall go on
In the same old rut under the direction
of Mackenzie.

POSTUM CEBEAL.
LIGHT "BOOZE"
I>o You Drink ItP
A minister's wife had quite a tussle with
coffee, and her experience is Inter-
esting. She says: "During 1 the two years
of my training: as a nurse while on night
fluty I became addicted to coffee ; drink-
lug, for between midnight and 4 o'clock
In the morning, when the patients were
asleep, there was little to do except make
the rounds, and It was quite natural that
I should want a good hot cup of coffee
about that time. It stimulated me and I
could keep awake better.
"After three or four years of 'coffee
drinking I becaxnÂ© a nervous wreck and
thought that I simply could riot live
without my coffee. All this time I was
subject to frequent bilious attacks', some-
times so severe as to keep me in bed for
several days.
"After being married, husband begged
me tc leave off coffee, for he feared that
it had already hurt me almost beyond
repair, so I resolved to make an effort
and release myself from the hurtful
habit. I began taking Postum Food Cof-
fee, and for a few days felt the languid,
tired feeling from the lack of the stimu-
lant, but I liked the taste of Postum and
that answered for the breakfast beverage
all right.
"Finally I began to feel clearer . headed
and had steadier nerves. After a year's
use of Postum I now feel like a new wo-
man. Have not had any bilious attacks
elnce I left off coffee." This lady re-
<iue*ts that her name be kept from pub-
lic print. Name given by Postum Co.,

During the discussion Dr.- Elllnwood
suggested that it would be wise to settle
on the site for the hospital in order that
the plans would conform properly there
to. Dr. d* Ancona thought it inadvisable
to discuss the site, as-any selection would
raise a storm of opposition and probably
defeat the proposed bond issue. Dr. Wil
liamson said that the present site would
be eliminated because several Supervisors
were opposed to it This leaves the onlji
available site now owned by the city on
the Almshouse and House of Correction
tracts, k -.-... . ,
â¢Architect Coffey, whose plans were
once 'accepted by the city and subse
quently readopted by the Board of Public
Works, desired to have his plans accepted
with the proviso that the suggestions em
bodied ln .the plans of Dr. Flint be
merged into his, but the committee de
cided otherwise. ,
The advisory committee of, physicians
appointed to consider plans for the pro
posed new City and- County, Hospital held
a conference, last s . night with Supervisor
d* Ancona , for the purpose" of considering
the question.. Two sets of plans had been
submitted! to the committeeâ one by Arr
chitect Coffey and a second by Dr. J. M.
Flint of the University of California.
After a lengthy discussion, participated
ln by Drs. Hodghead, Ellin wood,-Ander
son. Williamson, Buckley, Kerr, Hlrsch
felder and City Engineer Grunsky, it was
decided to recommend the two plans to
the Board of Works, with . instructions to
incorporate the best .of- both in one de
sign, upon, which estimates of cost will
be made. , '. .

NEW TORK STOCK LIST
XEW TORK. May 16. â The conspicuous fea
ture of to-day's weak stock market was entire
lack of any supporting demand at- any 'stage
of the djicllne. Evea the roam-shorts, who'al
most invariably cover snort contracts at the
end of a day of declining prices, showed no
solicitude about covering, and the market
seemed almost entirely to *acJc resiliency. The
liquidation was not heavy, but such as 1. was,
was very general. While the decision of the
anthracite miners for astrike was the ostens
ible cause of the weakness, the depression was
not confined to. the coalers, nor was It par
ticularly conspicuous there. Reading was first
in point of activity, but allowing for its half
ehares the sales were but little In excess of
thoee of Union Pacific. The three-rpolnt de
cline in Reading was fairly attributable to the
fact that it has been selected as the repre
sentative of recent speculative confidence in
the coal trade outlook. The other Â¦ coalers
shared about equally with the weakness of tne
general market, which is represented by quite
uniform losses of from 1 to 3 points. The un
flfcviatirjg assurance that there would be no
strike, which has been expressed throughout
the period Eince a strike was threatened by all
representatives of the controlling interests In
the coalers, leaves no room for doubt that the
final decision to strike was a surprise. Con
fidence in a favorable outcome of the struggle
of benefit to the coal operators continued to
be expressed in Wall street to-day. But this
could not alter the general Impression, that- a
prolonged and serious struggle is in prospect.
It did not need the ' formal announcement by
President Mitchell of the purpose of the min
ers to make the strike a national mining
etrike to awaken anxiety over the possible ex
tension of the labor trouble by sympathy into
other fields, especially Into the bituminous
coal fields. The collateral effects of such an
extension are eaey to be understood,, but . dif
ficult to estimate. The effect upon the Iron
and steel Industries, already struggling .with
scarcity of material of all kinds, would be
most notable. The Iron and steel stocks shared
in the general weakness. Reports of an ad
vance of $4 a ton in the price of Southern iron
rather strangely added to the depression, as it
is felt that the maintenance of the high level
of consumption is dependent upon the sustained
steadiness ~>t the price. Attention was given
also to the estimate of the Iron Age that the
producing capacity of pig iron for the coun
try would be increased 300,000 tons this year
and 4,000.000 tons by the end of 1903. The
wet weather in the Northwest retarding. the
seeding of the crops may have been a depress
ing Influence, although the weakness in the
corn market should have been a fair offset. .

ties - on that account. Berries in crates were
slow, particularly those from Florin, owing to
the greenness of the offerings.

the coal arrivals have- been as follows, viz. ;

Columbia, 12,062 tons; 1' from Washington. 350
tons, 2 from Australia, 4112 tons; total. 23,674
tons. The total amount received is fully equal
to the quantity required for general use. There
has. been a single arrival of 9150 tors on
thj Algoa from Japan. This Is the largest
amount we have had at any one time 'from
that section. It does not come here . see-king
a buyer, but Is for consumption by the im
porters. Business in the coal . line does not
show any marked improvement as to the quan
tity consumed, or the prices obtained, no sale
being made where the importer can show any
profit, although prices asked are exceptionally
cheap. Freight rates on coal from Great
Britain and Australia still rule low. This is
a singular fact in view of the grain freight
rates outward from here, remaining likewise
exceedingly low. This year will prove a par
ticularly unprofitable one to shipowner?, as
freights Inward and outward will leave little.
If any, profit to the carriers. Another cargo
of EaÂ«$ Greta la just at . hand and will be
used exclusively for domestic consumption.
Thla Is the third cargo which has been bought
and distributed solely for house uses and is
very strong evidence that It has been tried
and found well suited for that purpose."

The officers of the Golden Gate Valley
Improvement Club are: President, Thomas
Terry; vice president, "William Wright;
treasurer, Jacob Heinz; financial secre
tary. E. F. O'Connor; recording secretary,
M. J. Nuhrenberg.
D. Haley, a member of the executive
committee, spoke in favor of having- tha
Supervisors divide Van Ness avenue so
that the residents of the valley could have)
better access. He suggested that forty
feet be set aside for public conveyances
and forty feet for private vehicles. Ha
thought the Supervisors had no right to
close the avenue to citizens who had no
other means of gaining access to their
places of business. He said it should not
be a boulevard. Mr. Haley also appealed
for better street lighting. Chairman Ter
ry closed by asking, for better railroad
service. He said the present car line was
a' pioneer like himself and like a pioneer
deserved sympathy. He said he hoped to
see the day when better streetcar facili
ties were accorded the residents of the
valley. - - . Â¦ Â¦Â¦ * :.
Ex-Assemblyman Dibble spoke long and
eloquently. He called attention to mat
ters that should have the attention of
every â¢â¢ citizen in the district. He favored
public parks, better schools, better sew
erage, better streets and all such im
provements that can be had by the ex
penditure of public moneys. He signed the
membership role at the close of his speech.
DIBBLE JOINS CLUB.
I think the Mayor struck the key note. He
said that we have not asked and therefore- we
have not received. The fact undoubtedly is
that we are too modest. We have not suffi
ciently appreciated our own part of the city.
We have not been sufficiently aggressive- In
fighting for those things that are needed to
make this part of the city In every way beau
tiful and altogether Inhabitable. We are Just
beginning to realize that this dope and this
valley is In fact the most beautiful and most
sheltered and ought to be the most valuable
part of San Francisco.
' Franklin K. Lane, who is also a resident
of the district, was introduced and spoke
forcibly of the. needs of the district. He
said in part: .
I did not come here this evening: to talk to
you. but to listen to your wishes. I want to
hear the needs of this district and to help
you out in every way possible. I know that
there Is a crying need for better school facili
ties, but others do not inow it because you
have asked for nothing. The Bible tells us:
"Ask and you shall receive." Thus it ia in our
district â I say our, because I am one of you.
Since my election as Mayor of San Francisco
I have taken notes and had intended doing all
I could to Improve this portion of the city. X
believe In equal rights to al*. but do not be
lieve in _"-vinir special privileges to any par
ticular portion of San Francisco. (Applause.)
And that holds good aa long as X remain la
office. (Applause.) ....
I would like to hear from well-known citi
zens present what this district, needs, and X
assure you you will find in me one who will
further the interests of this beautiful valley.
I say, carry but your improvements and make
this- district one of tha finest places in the
city. As has been, stated by your chairman
we have plenty of ground for a park . and a
lot can be found for tha erection of a flnÂ»
school building. But we cannot do these things
Without - money. At the present time the
Beard of Supervisors is trying to raise money
to do these things, and if we can raise tha
money I assure you this portion of the city will
not be neglected. I want to hear from you. I
want to hear what you want, and what ought
to be done. Let me know what you want and
as chief executive of this city you will have
my support In all that you ask.
The chairman then introduced Mayor
Schmitz, and when the applause had sub
sided the latter spoke in part as follows:
MAYOR SCHMITZ'S A3>3>BESS.
In calling the meeting to order Mr. Ter
ry took occasion to tell of the importance
of agitation. He told how tne citizens in
the Mission had secured schoolhouses,
better streets, parks and lighting by ap
pealing ,to the Supervisors. He suggested
a like course, and said an executive com
mittee was doing all in its power to bring
about better conditions for the district
bounded by Broadway and Polk street,
the bay and the Presidio. The commit
teemen are: E. J. Wilkinson, D. Haley.
William Wright, Edwin Douglas, F. Eick
horst, A. J. Vanderwhite, D. Mahoney, G.
H. Walker, Royal Cudworth, William
Schaefter and Thomas Terry. : \7l'P-
Mayor Schmita was accorded a hearty
reception at the mass-meeting held by the
citizens of Golden Gate Valley last even
ing in Stelmke Hall. His Honor is a resi
dent-of that portion of the city and is
alive to its needs. The citizens who re
side Ihere have formed an improvement
club for. the purpose of "securing better
facilities from the municipality. X,ast
night's meeting was generously attended,
and the speeches made by the Mayor,
President Terry, City and County Attor
ney vFranklln . K. Lane, ex-Assemblyman
Dibble : and others were enthusiastically
received." Â¦ ' â¢ <
Allan H. Pollak, manager of the San
Francisco Gas Company, stated that the
directors of the company are out of. town
and could not be- present.' Pollak said
that liberal discounts would' be allowed
in the bids for public J lighting: on the
plans proposed of- reducing the nights
when streets are not lighted from five to
two or lighting the streets every night
In the year. . ,
John Steigler urged that $30,000 be ap
propriated to complete the Hall of Jus
tice and James Cosgrave, cashier of: the
Post, pleaded for. an appropriation of
$18,000 for public printing. Both petitions
were taken under advisement.
The -stewards of the Emergency and
City and County hospitals appeared be
fore the Finance Committee in the.even
ing to urge that their, salaries be in
creased from $65 to $75. They stated that
they were compelled to work twelve
hours a day for seven days in the week.
Action on the petition was' postponed; ;
The committee decided to recommend
the payment of two-thirds of the salaries
of Deputy Justices' Clerks Byers, Auber
tin. and Roxburgh, who were appointed
by Powel Fredrick, but whose demands
were held up by the Auditor because the
State law provides for only two deputies
and there were five in the office. Â¦'Â¦ i ;
Probably the most important appeal of
the day was made by X.. M.' King,* wh/j
represented the Merchants' Association.
He asked for an appropriation of $60,000
for the removal of the city's fire-alarm
wires from the telegraph poles so that
the telegraph company might be, enabled
to put its wires underground, in accord
ance with the ordinance passed . by the
Supervisors. He also requested the com
mittee to arrange for the construction of
public conveniences such as are privided
in Eastern and European cities.
E. R. Pease of the Mission Road Im
provement Olub and -I. T. Allen of the
Cycle Board of Trade asked that money
be provided for the completion of the Im
provement of Valencia street; The resi
dents of that portion of the city desire
that the street shall be -bituminized' from
Eighteenth on out to , Twenty-eighth
street. A. B. ilaguire made an appeal
in behalf of the Mission road, between
Oneida and Ocean avenues. - : â¢ :
O. K. Cushing. in behalf of the delega
tion' from the Point Lobos Improvement
Club, stated that the Sunset District was
in need of a .new schoolnouse, as the
building in wnich the school is located at
present is entirely inadequate to accom
modate the pupils of the neighborhood.
He asked also | for the construction of a
new lire house .ana for better police pro
tection. / . .
The. improvement clubs had. their inn
ing at the afternoon session of, the^ Fin
ance Committee yesterday. , Delegations
from the Point Lobos, the Mission Road
and the Golden Gate Valley. Improvement
Clubs appeared before the committee to
ask .for . appropriations., for the improve
ment of their particular portions of the
city; Chairman' Braitdenstein explained
that the primary duty of the Finance
Committee in making out the budget was
to provide for sufficient money to cover the
running expenses of the municipality- and
not ;to provide' money for permanent : im-!
pr ovements. â¢ He - advised tne delegations
that it would'be more proper for v them to
go before the Public Utilities Committee,
whose particular, province, it is to deal
with puollc improvements. . ::V
