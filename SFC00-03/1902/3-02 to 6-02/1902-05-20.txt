SOME. OF THE VICTIMS.
There was not a sign of life. Every
man had perished, they believed, although
it will be early In the morning before all
the rooms can be entered. Eight bodies
were first recovered and these were sent
to Coa? Creek. Twenty-six were soon
found. They were not disfigured beyond!
identification, and each corpse as It was
borne from the mouth of the great tomb
was surrounded by eager crowds of rela
tives of the men who had been stricken
down. The mine was not on fire except
in remote portions, and all the bodies will
perhaps be reached before daylight.
All day long the rescuers toiled at tha
slate obstruction, and not until 5 o'clock
dldthey force an entrance through It. Up
to that hour only five bodies had been
recovered, and hope was still high that
many miners within were safe. The hopes
of the living were doomed, however, for
when once the rescuers had entered and
proceeded they walked along one continu
ous tomb of death. (
WORK HARD.
The news of the disaster spread quickly
and the scenes at the mouth of the mine
while the workers were within were be
yond description. Business was suspend
ed in Coal Creek, and all its mines as
soon as the news became known, and men
and- women and children gathered around
the Fraterville entrance. Women whose
husbands and sons were within were wild
with grief.
They had not been at work long before
the. terrible explosion occurred. There
was a fearful roar, and then flames shot
from the entrance and the air shafts. As
soon as possible two rescuing parties wero
started In. one at the main entrance, tha
other through, the Thistle mine, which ad-
Joins,, and in. which no men, were at work.
The -Thistle party .was unable to make
any Headway; as' the-gas stifled workers.
The FratervlITe v party went fully two
miles under the earth until a heavy fall
of slate was encountered. At this barrier
men worked desperately, hoping against
hope that those beyond might be safe.
TERRIBLE EXPLOSION.
The Fraterville mine is the oldest mine
In the Coal Creek district, having been
opened In 1S70. It is fully three miles from
the opening of the mine to the point
where the men were at work.
Of the large number of men and boys
who went to work this morning only onÂ»
is alive, and he Is so badly injured that
he cannot live. This man is William Mor
gan, an aged Englishman, who was a
road man in the mine. He was blown
out of the entrance by the force of the
explosion. One hundred and seventy-five
miners were checked in for work this
morning by the" mine boss. In addition to
these there were boys who acted as help
ers and drivers and road men and others
to the number of perhaps fifty.
COAL CREEK, Tenn., May 19.â More
than 200 men and boys met instant death
at the Fraterville coal mine, located two
miles west of this city, at 7:30 o'clock this
morning, because of a gas explosion.
On his way back to the palace King Al
fonso was greeted with hearty shouts
from the people of "Long live the King!"
Several thousand persons attended the re
ception at the palace to-night The build-
Ing was so crowded that a large number
of those present were unable to see King
Alfonso and the Queen mother."
As the King passed down the line the
soldiers greeted "him with hearty cheers.
He then took up a position at the side of
the grand stand, where his mother was
seated. The march past began at once
and lasted for an hour and a half. All
the branches of the Spanish army were
Included In the procession of the grand
review, which concluded with the gallop
past of a half-dozen regiments of cavalry
riding ten horses abreast. The Queen's
Lancers, with fluttering pennants of the
national colors, led.
King Alfonso, in the unifrom of a cap
tain general and mounted on a handsome
bay charger, left the palace at 4 o'clock In
the afternoon. He was accompanied by
General Weyler, the Duke of Connaught
(the representative of King Edward),
Grand Duke Vladimir (the representative
of Russia), and other princes and a suite
of staff officers. His Majesty rode to the
Pazo de Recoletos, where the troops were
drawn up.
The entire population of Madrid seems
to have assembled this afternoon along
Xhe Pazo del Prado and Pazo de Recole
tos, the grand boulevard of Madrid, to
witness the great military review. The
weather was beautiful. Grandstands had
been erected at a central point on the
line of march and from these the Queen
mother, members of the royal family, the
diplomats and members of the Cortea
witnessed the march past of over a thou
sand soldiers. The entire garrison of Mad
rid, several regiments from the provinces,
and the naval detachments which had
been brought to Madrid especially for the
occasion, took part.
TROOPS CHEER THE KING.
MADRID. May 19.â The police here are
extremely reticent regarding the discov
eVy of the anarchist plot. Several of the
papers now question whether the arrested
men really entertained the intentions at
tributed to them. It is said that the au
thorities on getting an Inkling of the pur
chase of dynamite ordered inquiries made
concerning each purchaser and the ex
istence of the conspiracy is* thus thought
to have been discovered. Nevertheless
the Liberal to-day declares that as a re
sult of the preliminary examination pro*- -i
ably only Gabriel Lopez, an employe of
$n insurance company, and Francisco
Suarez, the well-known anarchist, will be
brought to trial, although the. others are
still detained. Lopez's wife, when ques
tioned by the police, admitted that her
husband had frequent mysterious visitors
recently. Lopez has fairly good ante
cedents. Prior to the present trouble he
professed to be a Federal Republican.
Lopez and Suarez were again confronted
to-day with a result similar to that of
yesterday, when Lopez declared that
Suarez gave him the dynamite cartridges
found in his possession and told him to
throw them as the royal coach passed
through the Carrera San Geronimo. The
case is in the hands of a prudent magis
trate, who it is believed, can be depended
on not to give exaggerated importance to
the affair.
CONSPIRACY AT MADRID.
The greatest secrecy concerning this
plot has been observed, concludes the cor
respondent, and the Emperor forbade the
newspapers of Vienna to mention the af
fair.
The Emperor was recently going on a
night train from Vienna to Budapest. In
the final inspection of the imperial train
at the terminus of the state railroad at
Vienna, made ten minutes before his Ma
jesty's arrival there, a bomb covered with
paper was found in the Emperor's com
partment. It was evidently calculated
that this bomb would explode the moment
his Majesty entered the car. An investi
gation of the matter led to the dismissal
of several railroad employes.

issuing from small fissures. The locality
is cracked 'all over. ; "
The strange color and' the great depth
of the new inlet of the sea on the Wallibu

there, and that a new crater has been

PARIS, May 19.â Martinique mails, for
warded just prior to the recent disaster,
Â¦arrived here yesterday. One most inter
esting letter is from a young lady, who
i 'was t among the victims. It was dated
I May 3. After describing , the aspect of
j St. Pierre before dawn, thetown being lit
I tip with flames from the volcano, every
Â¦ thing covered with, ashes and the people
greatly excited, Vet not panic, stricken,
she said: . Â¦Â£ - / ...
" "My calmness astonishes -me. I am
I awaiting the event : tranquilly. My only
suffering is from v the.- dust.? which pen
etrates everywhere, . even through closed
windows and doors. We are Â¦ all calm.
Mamma is not a bit anxious. 'Edith alone
is frightened. If death awaits us there
will be a numerous company -to' leave the
wÂ«rld. Will it be by fire or asphyxiation?
It will be what God wills. You will have
our last thoughts. I Tell brother Robert

haps, be no longer. true when this letter
reaches j'ou." Â¦ Â¦-.. g Â¦Â¦. ' '
I The Edith mentioned was a lady visitor,
who was among the .rescued. This and
I other letters Inclosed samples of the
ashes, which fell over the doomed town.
The ashes are a bluish gray impalpable
powder, resembling newly ground flour
and slightly smelling of sulphur.
Another letter, written during the after
noon of May 3, says:
"The population of the neighborhood of.
the top of the mountain is flocking to the
city. Business is suspended, the inhab
itants are panic stricken and the firemen
are sprinkling the streets and roofs to
settle the ashes, which are filling the air."
These and other letters seem to indicate
that evidences of the impending disaster
were numerous five days before it oc
curred.
It is difficult to understand how it was
that a general exodus of the population of
St. Pierre did not take place before
May 8. Still another letter says:
"St. Pierre presents an aspect unknown
to the natives. It is a city sprinkled with
gray snow, a winter scene without cold
The inhabitants of, the neighborhood are
abandoning their* houses, villas and cot
tages and are flocking to the city. It is

France, May 18:
Â¦ "I have informed the population that

Despite the precautions taken by the
authorities looting continues in the north
of the -island, though it has- practically
been stopped in St. Pierre. In the country
many houses have been robbed and
burned. Â¦ Soldiers have been sent out with
Instructions to take severe measures if
necessary, but put a stop to the dis

Notwithstanding the rain the tempera-"
ture to-night is 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a
mark from which it has receded only
during the fall of rain since early this
morning. "
Rain fell here to-day for the first time
in a fortnight. This long drought and
the fact that the grass has been burled
under a layer of ashes has made it par
ticularly difficult to obtain fodder for the
horses and â¢ cattle, which are dying in
unprecedented numbers.
BOBBED AND BXTBNED.
These flames continue to stream from
the crater to-day, and with. so great force
that they are visible from St. Marie, .a
village in the extreme north of the is
land. The atmosphere is full of dust, and
the heat is terrific. ' Life on the island is
all but unbearable, and the suffering of
the refugees who continue to crowd into
Fort de France is extreme. â¢ :
The wind veered and a mantle of dark
ness was swept westward across the is
land, enveloping Fort de France, upon
which volcanic dust fell to a depth of
more than an Inch and a half. So heavy
was the dust that filled the air that respi
ration became a labor, and a fear of suf
focation came upon the inhabitants.
Great alarm continued for more than
four hours, and it was not until the cloud
of ashes blew out to sea in the early even
ing that confidence was restored. All last
night the summit of Mont Pelee had the
appearance of a gigantic blast furnace at
Â¦which a great force was working. Flames
shot skyward in sheets that at times
lighted up the entire island. For a few
minutes the fires would drop back into
the mouth of the crater, only to reissue
with redoubled force.
Ashes were spouted in great clouds from
the crater all day yesterday. The ex
plosion began in the early morning, when
a black column rose above Mont Pelee,
accompanied by internal rumblings and
a tremor of the earth that sent the seas
back from the land in powerful waves.
This column was first caught by a cur
rent of air that carried it northward.
Then an upper current swept it back in
the opposite direction. Thus it made an
immense and well-formed letter T, the
base of which rested in a cup of flames,
the crest of the volcano from which it
sprang.

day, however, that the Eagle had reached
Avalon in safety. All the coast towns

No advices regarding storm effects have

headquarters, but Observer Franklin says
that there can be no doubt that deciduous
orchards were damaged. Oranges will not
suffer as the bulk of the crop already is
shipped, but blooming fruit trees prob
ably were injured. Late planted grain
will suffer as the winds have parched the
soil. An increase of irrigation is made
necessary. , Continued high north winds
and sand storms are predicted for the
next twenty-four hours.
Neither the Southern Pacific nor tho
Santa Fe suffered damage from the blow..
According to advices which reached the
headquarters of both systems the wind
was dying down to the eastward. In the

most, and cherries and prunes did not
escape. However, as all of the varieties
named, with the exception of prunes, are
so plentiful as to require a liberal thin

advantage, as a rule, than a detriment.
Shade .trees suffered somewhat, poplars
in particular losing many limbs owing to
the brittle nature of the branches. At

ST. KITTS; B. W. I., May 19.â As the
full extent of the disaster worked
in St. Vincent by the explosion of
La Soufriere becomes known the
horror is Increased. Conditions
there grow worse day by day, not
withstanding the fact that the vol
cano apparently has returned to its state
of passivity.
The island is famine-stricken, although
supplies have been sent in from all of the
.British West Indian Islands. Disease has
appeared, and there are not enough physi
cians present to give the required relief.
Life in St. Vincent is made almost im
possible by the sickening stench that
gives the entire island a resemblance to
neglected shambles. Everywhere noxious
vapors are wafted by the torrid winds
that 'seem to be not in the least tempered
by the surrounding waters.
MANY BODIES NOT BURIED.
These conditions are bad enough in the
southern part of the island about Kings
ton, but they are multiplied a thousana
times in the Carib country about La Sou
friere and at Georgetown.

interment has been given to eighteen
hundred bodies, but other hundreds lie
decomposing under the tropical sun. The
official estimate of the victims of the vol
cano has now been increased to twenty
two hundred. That means that at least
four hundred bodies are unburied. . But
that is the least of the trouble. Thus far
no effort has been made to do more than
care for the living and bury the dead.
All about are dead cattle poMutlng the
atmosphere, which already is heavily la
den with disease.
In one of the ravines near Morne Garou
the bodies of eighty-seven Carib Indians
were found piled together. Not far away
are the carcasses of hundreds of cattle.
It has now been ordered that these men
aces to life be removed. Quicklime is be
ing used to destroy the bodies. Fires are
burning over the district which was laid
Â¦waste by La Soufriere, and in these are to
bo thrust the carcasses of the cat
tle. Eruptions have ceased.
LA SOTJFRIEBE QUIET.
La Soufriere is as quiet as it was before
the explosion ten days ago.
Arrangements are being made for the
exploration of the new craters. Local au
thorities believe that the forces which
were pent up within the earth have been
so relieved ' that there is no longer dan
ger of eruptions, and the ; refugees in
Georgetown and Kingston are being en
couraged to neturn to their homes In the
country.
Above La Soufriere hangs a cloud of
sulphurous gas, but the rumblings have
entirely ceased and no ashes or lava have
been put forth for four days.
It has been estimated by the Govern
ment that the" losses of the destruction of
produce, growing crops and livestock will
aggregate $300,000. There will be no sugar
or arrowroot produced in the island this
year. In the hospitals are now 140 pa
tients, all suffering from 'burns or from
the effects of inhaling suffocating gases.
Supplies are being given out daily to
more than 4000 refugees. It Is planned that
Government loans will be made to such
as are able to resume work upon estates
and as soon as possible the island will be
returned to a self-supporting state. It la
not desired that charity be accepted to
any greater extent than is absolutely re
quired.
SUSPENDS SUBSCRIPTIONS.
President Thinks Enough Belief Has
Been Supplied.
WASHINGTON. May 19.â The following
statement was given out at the White
House to-day:
"On Saturday, immediately on receiving
Consul Ayme's dispatch, the President
directed the secretaries of War and Navy
to inquire as to what was the direct con
dition of affairs at Martinique and St.
Vincent. These reports will be made pub
lic as soon as received. All the supplies
and the money subscribed hitherto have
been urgently, needed, but until further
information is received it is deemed best
that the receipt of subscriptions be sus
pended."
Explosions at Le Carbet.
PARIS, May 19.â Governor L'Huerrere
of Martinique cabled to the Colonial Min
ister, M. de Crais, announcing: that Mont
Pelee continues to throw up immense
quantities of cinders, which owing to a
change in the direction of the wind are
now covering the country districts of the
island. Violent explosions have been
heard at Le Carbet.

stantly expressed wishes and hopes that the
messes cf the people should interest themselves

affairs of government and is proof that- when
the people will arouse themselves and take such
lntercFt, their power will ever prevail. : . : -
It was a great victory.^ Like every good
citizen who favors honest administration of lo- J

sentiment of pride at the success which has
attended the fight for better conditions in San
Jose. All â¢ the people Interested in the sub
stantial welfare of that city seemed for once
to have forgotten the small differences -that
have at times existed and to have united for
tho betterment of the city's administration.
I am hlshly gratified not only at the local re

Stoesser was a native of Germany and
about 77 years of age. He came to the
United States in 1846 and to Califor
nia in August, 1850, after a long
and tedious trip around the Horn on tfie

the mining sections of the State, with
poor results, and also in various posi
tions in San Francisco, Stoesser finally
settled in this valley In April, 1853, and
engaged in the merchandise business in
a small way. He succeeded in building
up a large business and a fortune esti
mated at $500,000. He was always known
as an honorable, progressive and public
spirited citizen. The only public position
he ever held was that of City Treas
urer of Watsonviile, from the incorpora
tion of the city In 18G8 until 1900, when he

WEALTHY CLUB WOMAN
SUCCUMBS TO INJURIES
The fights for the offices of Mayor,
Treasurer and Clerk were pretty ones.
The only Mackenzie! te elected is T. J. Mc-
Geoghegan, the present Treasurer, who
beat Warren F. Blakeslee 260 votes. Mc-
Geoghegan is very popular, and in >the
last election received the biggest majority
of any candidate, but the odium attaching
F. J. Zedeman and a man named Hazel
were arrested for illegal voting. The
former, who was serving as a ballot clerk
of the First Precinct, is employed on Mac
kenzie's ranch near Guadaloupe. He was
registered from the Oakland House, and
the proprietor of the place, who swore to
the complaint, says Zedeman has not
lived there for nearly a year. Zedeman
supplied $2500 bail and was released. It
is said other warrants have been sworn
to, but they have not yet been served.
To-day's struggle began with the open-
Ing of the polls and did not close until
the last ballot was counted. Macken
zie's thoroughbreds never worked before
as they did to-day, but they were unable
to overcome the prejudice of the people
against them. The vote was the largest
in the history of the city, 4636 ballots be
ing cast for Mayor. There was consider
able excitement about the polls all day.
Mackenzie had searched the State for
San Joseans who could vote, and probably
200 of this closs were imported. The prompt
action and watchfulness of the citizens'
campaign committee probably prevented
much illegal voting.
EXCITING ELECTION DAY.
These men aided, but it was the people
Â¦who have been so enraged by the gang
who arose in their might and carried the
election.
Mitchell Phillips, a politician, was also
a factor in the fight and aided in . the
work. "Jim" Rea, who taught Johnnie
Mackenzie the game of politicB, but who
was afterward dethroned by his ; lieuten
ant, cast his lot with the reformers this
time, and to him belongs no small share
of praise for the victory. Mackenzie
treated Rea contemptuously after suc
ceeding him as boss, and Rea's part of the
fight to-day was one of revenge. He
brought hundreds of votes to the reform
ers, and taught his former underling a
few tricks in the game of politics.
- Opposed to him was the Republican
Good Government League, with which
were associated the reform Democrats
and the better class of all other ele
ments. These . forces were marshaled b/ 1
B. A. Hayes, the president of the Good
Government League, ' who has waged an
active war against Mackenzie and gang
rule for years. Hayes to-night is the
mest popular man in the- city.
Although the candidates for Mayor were
WorswicK and Greeninger, they were al
most lost sight of, and the issue settled
down to one of reform versus Mackenzie
ism. E. A. Hayes and his brother, J. O.
Hayes, own the Mercury and Herald, and
these two papers have made a hard fight
against the gang. Although the charges
or blackmail and extortion against the
Police and Fire Commissioners were dis
missed in the Council, these papers have
shown that gamblers paid tor "protec
tion," that many, firemen were assessed
for political purposes and that there was
general grafting for theater tickets by the
gang. These and other misdoings of the
push evidently caused the people to turn
out to-day and bury Mackenzie and hi3
associates under an avalanche of ballots.
In the campaign just closed the fight
was an out-ana-out one between the
Gage machine represented by John
Mackenzie on the one side and the re
form element, under the banner of the
Citizens' ticket, on the other. Since Mac
kenzie broke away from. Rea two yea.s
ago he has built up a strong machine
with the aid of the railroad bureau, and
this was his first fight without aid from
Rea.
The Mercury and Herald were sere
naded, and then the band proceeded to
the office of James W. Rea and serenaded
him. A march to the City. Hall was then
taken up. The â¢ crowd massed on the
steps, and as the officials in the City
Clerk's office put out their, heads cries of
"Throw down the keys" went up. .-.
REA'S HOTTB, OF REVENGE.
To-day's election and the campaign pre
ceding it were the hottest ever known in
San Jose, and the interest manifested in
the result this evening was almost as
great as in a Presidential election. For
hours the vicinity of First and Santa
Clara streets around the bulletin boards
was one mass of people, howling and
shouting for Worswick. The climax of
this entnudiasm was reached at 9 o'clock,
when the Fifth Regiment band made its
appearance. A surging stream of people,
numbering fully 20u0, felt in behind and
the procession made a tour of the city.
An automobile, with brooms and an
American nag, was in the lead. Behind
the band ana at the head of the Inde
pendence Club was big Uan Ryan, the
Fourth Ward politician. For blocks the
streets were jammed with people. On the
hats of many were pictures of Worswick
and many carried horns and cow bells.
Mackenzie has ruled with an iron
hand; the people have been afraid to op
pose him and his gang; but to-day the
voters rose up and defeated his entire
ticket, with the exception of T. J. Mc-
Geoghegan for Treasurer.
Gecrge D. Worswick is elected Mayor
over Adolph Greeninger by 266 majority.
Joseph A. Belloli Jr. is elected City Clerk
over J. W. Cook by 103 votes. McGeoghe
gan defeats Warren F. Blakeslee for
Treasurer by 260 votes. B. D. Mathews,*
Patrick Murray and Al D. Hubbard are
elected to the Council by majorities rang
ing from 649 to 480.
SAN JOSE, May 19.â San Jose broke

Si>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
City Is Wild With
Rejoicing Over
Its Deliverance
The peneral theory Is that Mrs. McCar
thy had chlded her son with having been
continually Intoxicated of late; that he
became incensed and in an ungovernable
outburst of passion began his murderous
attack. Mrs. McCarthy was 60 years old.
The murderer is about 20 years of age.
The Coroner's jury returned a verdict
charging John ' McCarthy with having
caused the deatn of Mrs. Honora Mc-
Carthy. .
"When John McCarthy Sr., the 64-year
old husband of the victim and father of
the matricide, left home at noon yester
day his wife and son were eating dinner
In the kitchen. Upon his return, twenty
minutes later, he found his wife dead be
hind the stove, with a fork on which was
a piece of meat In one hand. There was
a large contusion over the left temple â
evidence that she had been struck a pow
erful blow. She had thrown up her left
arm to protect her face from a second
blow as she lay prostrate, and the mem
ber touched the hot stove. From elbow to
wrist it was shockingly burned.
While she lay where she had fallen the
unnatural son must have concluded to
finish his deadly work. Taking a revolver
he fired five bullets into the feeble old wo
man. One bullet entered the head above
the left ear. one entered just below the
car, a third passed through the throat,
severing both carotid arteries, another
penetrated the left elbow, while the last
lodged in the right shoulder. The matri
cide's weapon must have been close to his
victim's body, as when she was found her
ciothing was on fire, while the paper on
the wall near which the aged mother lay
Â¦was powder burned. The face of the vic
tim was black from powder specks.
SALINAS, May 19.â The Inquest held
this afternoon in Castrovllle over the
body of Mrs. Honora McCarthy, the a&ed
victim of a son's fury, brought out some
startling facts. It completely upset John
McCarthy's remarkable contention that
he killed his gray-haired, parent to save
his own life. The story told by witnesses,
together with later revelations, show the
crime to have been one of horrible
atrocity.

RESUMES MAIDEN NAME
SANTA ROSA, May 19.â Judge Burnett
thi3 morning granted permission to Mrs.
Lulu McArthur Hopper, the former wife
of Capitalist Thomas Hopper, to resumo
her maiden name, Lulu McArthur. The di
vorce obtained by Mrs. Hopper was only
recently granted In Department 2, and at
that time she sought to resume her
maiden name. Her petition was denied
by Judge Burnett, but came up in a sub
sequent proceeding. Mrs. Hopper did not
appear in the courtroom this morning.
The petition recited that Mrs. Hopper
would be greatly annoyed and harassed
by continuing the use of her husband's
name. Judge Burnett held that, good
cause appearing,, the petition would be
granted, and by the name of Lulu Mc-
Arthur she will be known in the future.
At the time of the marriage, in 1892,
Thomas Hopper was reputed to be the
wealthiest man in Sonoma County. Twice^
marital difficulties arose and the couple
separated. Mrs. Hopper obtained the re

A HERRIN EATS CROW.
Major left San Jose at
3:30 p. in. yesterday. At that hour he
was assured by Sam Rucker, one of the
ablest leaders in the Good Government
legion, that victory was in sight. The
major on leaving remarked to Hayes:
"Ycu will soon observe the most re
markable phenomenon In natural history
âa Herrin will eat a crow."
The inglorious finish of Gage's political
career was the chief topic of comment
last night in the Primary League, Palace
court, (Jnion League Club and t Mutual
Alliance headquarters.
The coming ex-Governor will perhaps
have a few delegates in the State con
vention, but the showing will be small.
It is conjectured that aspirants for such
offices as Treasurer, Attorney General.
Secretary' of State, Superintendent x of
Schools, Surveyor, State Printer and
Clerk of the Supreme Court will be
scampering around to locate the guber
natorial band wagon, but they will not
apply to Dan Kevane for information.
HERRIN AND BURNS MONEY.
It Is common gossip that Burns and
Herrin supplied the money which was
wagered to bolster up the boss fight in
San Jose. In -politics Herrin's stupidity
is proverbial. He can pick a winner when
there is only one candidate in the field,
but that is the limit of his discernment.
Dan Burns was formeily pretty clever.
He was always good in putting on a tine
front and a ready bluff, but he seems to
bo. approaching the stage of paresis as
far as political sense is concerned. He
could have ascertained by familiar talks
with the push that . the Republicans will
not stand for Gage.. Perhaps Herrin sup
plied the money for the Mackenzie push
to wager. The machine manipulators
were throwing out hints last Saturday
that Harriman had authorized Herrin to
back Mackenzie in the San Jose election.
As proof of such backing by the railroad
attention was subsequently called to the
departure- of an "army of rounders from
this city. Every rounder had a ticket for

Last evening Major Frank McLaugh

1896 and 1898, sent the following messagf
of congratulation to the anti-boss
leaders: / .
V SAN FRANCISCO. May 19. 1802.

SAN JOSEANS REJOICING.
"Wait until the San Jose election; tker
the people of the State will get an object
lesson showing Gage's strength." Â¦ -
Mackenzie himself would not admit the
possibility of a reverse. It was the gen
eral opinion of politicians throughout thÂ«

could contribute. Jesse Marks, the Benjo
Eyed Kid and other earnest supporter;
of the administration went to San Josi
with money to wager that Mackenzie
would win. Three months ago the pusl
shouted: ;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 20, 1902.
THE lesson of the San Jose election is plain. It means the overthrow of Gage and his machine henchmen. At the outset ot the gubernatorial campaign the push
asserted that the battle in San Jose would demonstrate the Governor's strength. To make the demonstration effective the push sent rounders from Bakers
field, Fresno, Oakland and San Francisco to reinforce Mackenzie. Money was lavishly expended and recklessly wagered to stimulate enthusiasm for the boss
ticket, but despite the power of money corruptly used and State patronage shamefully misapplied, the Gage administration received a stinging rebuke from the
honest citizenship of San Jose. Gage regarded Santa Clara County as his stronghold, and San Jose the citadel of his strength. There he expected an endorsement
that would be an object lesson to other localities. He got the lesson, and it now remains to be seen whether he will heed it. Johnny Mackenzie, last but not least
of the bosses, may take his place in the ranks of the rebuked and defeated along with Billy Herri n, Dan Burns, Jere Burke and John Lynch.
The victory of the reform forces is complete. The anti-Mackenzieites elect, their candidates for Mayor, City Clerk and Councilmenl Out of the wreck the
boss machine saves but a single office, that of Treasurer. , â¢ ,

George RIghter Jr.. who said he repre
sented holders of 7000 shares of stock, pro
tested against the proposed payment of
4 per cent commission to the underwriters
of the issue of $2^0.000,000 bonds.
Before the resolutions were adopted
Samuel B. Strong of Providence protested
against the plan. He said he believed
that a good many stockholders who had
sent proxies to the meeting had never
had an opportunity to see the contract
between the corporation and J. P. Mor
gan & Co. relative to the underwriting
of the new bond issue. He moved that
the meeting adjourn for a month so all
could learn about the plan. The motion
was lost. C. H. Venner of Boston en
tered a formal protest against the carry
ing out of the plan for exchanging pre
ferred stock for bonds. He objected on the
ground that there was no authority of
law for the corporation to change its
stock for bonds, and further that the act
of the New Jersey Legislature permitting
the company to make this exchange was
unconstitutional and void. The protest
was placed on file.
NEW YORK. May 19.â A special meet

and the issuing of $250,000,008 new bonds.
Resolutions authorizing the changes were
adopted, and the secretary of the meeting
announced that SO per cent of the pre
ferred and 76 per cent of the common
shares were voted in favor of the plan.
Fitzsimmons and Jeffries will come to

The feeling between the' big fellows is
strained, but it Is hoped by interested
parties that they will not go outside oÂ£
business at the meeting. Fitzsimmons
stated last night that he would not lose
his temper and trusted that ' Jeffries
would act the gentleman. At any rate
their meeting to-morrow afternoon will
be a memorable one.

The provision for a naval station on the
Great Lakes was stricken out on a point
of order by Roberts. The bill was passed.
On motion of Gardner of New Jersey
the bill limiting the hours of daily service
on Government work to eight hours was
passed under suspension of the rules, as
was a House joint resolution fixing De
cember 31, 1902, as the date when entries
under the mining laws of the United
States of certain lands in the Spokane
(Wash.) Indian reservation shall take
effect. <
A Senate bill providing for the erection
of the northern branch of the National
Home for Disabled Soldiers at Hot
Springs. S. D., was passed.
At 5:15 p. m. thfe House adjourned.
Ball offered an amendment, which wa3
agreed to, providing that in case ship
builders enter into a combination or
agreement or understanding by which
competition would be shut off, then all
the ships shall be built in Government
yards.
Roberts referred to what he termed the
pathetic plea of Dayton for the laboring
man and said that when a labor delega
tion appeared before the committee they
made no plea for work in private yards.
The amendment of Roberts was agreed
to without division.
Dayton said the amendment would not
be in the interests of the laboring men,
because there was a limit placed on the
number of men that the navy-yards could
employ, and it would extend the work
over many years.
Adams of Pennsylvania made a point
of order against it, which was -finally sus
tained by the chair. An appeal was ta
ken and the chair was overruled, 86 to 109.
The question was then on agreeing to the
amendment. \
IN GOVERNMENT YARDS.
Foss urged the members to consider
what the amendment meant Past expe
rience, he said, had proved that it cost E0
per cent more to build ships in Govern
ment yards than in private yards, and he
cited the Texas and the Maine.
WASHINGTON, .May 19.â Before ad
journment to-day the House passed, the
naval appropriation bill. The feature oÂ£
the debate was on the amendment offered
by Roberts of Massachusetts, providing
that three of the ships provided for in the
billâ a battleship, a cruiser and a gunboat
âshall be built in Government yards.
Adams of Pennsylvania made a point of
order against the amendment, which Sher
man sustained, but on an appeal by Rob
erts the chair was overruled and the
amendment was agreed to. TUnder sus
pension of the rules the bill for eight
hours' work on all Government contracts
was passed.
When the House adjourned on Saturday
a point of order was pending, offered by
Underwood of Alabama, in relation to the
appointment of 500 additional cadets ! at
Annapolis under the rules and regulations
authorized by the Secretary of the Navy,
the appointments to be distributed among
each Senator, member and delegate,
twenty-four delegates to be appointed at
Jarge.
Underwood contended that the clause
was a wholly different proposition from
the authorization of a battleship. He
said it would be a very dangerous inno
vation if the chair overruled the point of
order.
Wheeler of Kentucky asked if Under
wood was opposed to the provision, to
which Underwood replied that he was, as
it would open the way for any new legis
lation.
CADET TO MIDSHIPMAN.
The chair sustained the point of order.
An amendment by Dayton then was
agreed to, changing the name cadet to
midshipman.
Wateon of Indiana offered an amend
ment, which was agreed to, repealing sec
tions 8, 9 and 10 of the act of March 3,
1899, organizing and increasing the effi
ciency and personnel of the navy and ma
rine corps, having reference to retire
ments.
Foss submitted a statement, prepared
by the Bureau of Naval Intelligence,
showing that there were but thirty-eight
line officers at the Naval Academy ' in
stead of fifty-eight as had been stated.
Ball of Texas submitted an amendment
striking out the provision limiting the
number of ships to be built by any one
firm or corporation. It was agreed to.
Mudd made a point of order against the
provision in the bill providing that in the
construction of naval vessels the provi
sions of the naval appropriation bill for
1901 shall be observed, and followed, be
cause, he said, it changed existing laws.
The motion was adopted.
Roberts of Massachusetts offered an
amendment authorizing the Secretary of,
the Navy to build one battleship, one ar
mcred cruiser and "one gunboat "in such
Government navy-yards as he may desig
nate."

lation nad been spread for them. But
before bread- was. broken Rev. E. P. Den
nett delivered the audress of dedication.
He-spoke in an eloquent manner of the
work ; which is . being done by orphanages
incaring for homeless children. He said
that the ,time ? hau come when learned
men and experienced teachers were de
votin" their -time to the study of the child
problem, as they" have come to recognize
that trie adult is molded through the
molding: of the child. He said that," as
the institution to be dedicated- was found
ed -in:^love, it should not be called an'or
phanage, but a home, which is the name
of the* most sacred place on earth : .
- Rev. -J.: N.'; Beard onered up prayer for
the success of, the. new. orphanage.-
At the conclusion of the children's pro
gramme Rev.. W. -W. Case, .who Is a mem
ber of the advisory board, made, a short
address to the little ones' and to the as
sembieu guests. He' spoke of the great
work which is being done by the Meth
odist . cnurch In London for â¢ the - care- of
the. homeless children, and said, he was in
'favor -of- Ihe church in this clt^ extend
ing its work- in; that -line.?.. He -said he
hoped to see the time when the Methodist
Orphanage -would shelter hundreds â¢ or
even thousands, of parentless boys .and
girls: In closing he advised the little ones
always to be. honest and truthful.
DR.. CASE. SPEAKS.
The dedication yesterday .: morning was
witnessed by. the officers, patronesses and
friends of the worthy Institution!. The
ceremony was commenced with exercises
by the little girls and boys, who conducted
tbemseives In a manner that showed they
are profiting by. the careful training they,
are. receiving. These exercises 'were- held
in the' children's playhouse, "a substan
tially constructed buiiuing;ln the rear -of
the orphanage. The programme consisted
of hymns, in which all the children joined
their sweet voices, and in recitations by
individuals.
Institution Is surrounded by. trees, and no
more healthful location could be selected
as a home for growing children. At pres
ent there are about seventy orphans, most
of -whom -are little girls, enjoying the
shelter of the orphanage. . - ; . .
TJie reservation does not supply enough
water for its own needs, and for many
it has been found necessary to seek
aid from the Spring Valley Company. The
plan of getting a supply from Lobos
Creek has been debated frequently before,
but it has always been deemed that the
expense would be too great. It seems now
as. if the scheme would be carried out.
The military authorities at the Presidio
have decided If possible to make use of
the waters of Lobos Creek. The Spring
Valley. Company attempted to partially
supply â¢ its reservoirs with the creek
waters some time ago, but the project
was abandoned on account of the protests
of citizens. It is claimed, however, by
the filter company, which has interested
the army authorities in the scheme, that
the i water can be purified in a satisfac
tory manner. It Is proposed to erect a
pumping plant with a daily capacity of
1,000,000 gallons,-.

assemblage was but the forerunner of the
great gathering of knights and their
mends who will be here in August next.
"The advent of these loyal citizens of a
great nation," said he, "was heralded by
a shape-up this morning, and they were
not then all here. What may we expect
when nearly 150,0o0 assemble here in a few
wetks?"

The Supreme Grand Circle of the Com
panions of the Forest, Foresters of Amer
ica, met yesterday in the Foresters build
ing, The Grand Circle was opened by Su
preme Grand Chief Companion Mrs. L. G.
Miller, assisted by Mrs. A. Boehm,. sub
chief; Mrs. G. Valente, treasurer; Mrs.
Florence N. v Morrow, secretary; Kate M.
Howard, right guide; Annie Fernandez,
left guide; Jennie Berger, Inside guard;

T. A. Blynn was questioned regarding
Miss McKinney's mental condition, and
testified that he had known the lady for
twelve years and that her mind had al
ways; been sound. Blynn said that he is
a pliysician, having a diploma from the
College of Fine Forces, now located in
San Jose, but formerly of Hobo ken, N.
J. The Directors looked puzzled, but the
evidence was allowed to stand, as Blynn
testified as a friend and not a physician.
Jonn B. Quigley was called to the stand
but was quickly excused when in an^w-r
to a question he replied that he had nu
children attending the John Swett School
and would rather see them in their graves
:l,an become pupils of the schools Quie
ley was interrupted at this point, and it
afterward developed that he had a griev
ance against Lyser.
Mrs. J. Mlllington, who has a son In the
John Swett School, testified that he came
home cne day and said Mr. Lyser had
stated that he did not like Miss McKin
ney and intended to "fire" her. Mrs H
Zimmerman testified that her son had
given her like information and had cried
at the thought.
School Superintendent Webster testified
that he had inquired into the charges
ajrainst the accused and found that they
v.ere not well based; but as the charges
were eworn to by Lyser, and as Miss Mc-
Kinney s mental state was in contro
versy, he deemed it best that the board
inquire into the facts. This closed the
testimony and the matter was argued by
counsel and finally submitted for decision.
WAS OF SOUND MIND.
Among those who testified In Miss Mc-
Kirr.ey's favor were Miss I* Miller, Miss
A. Griffith, Mrs. C. K. Riordan. A. L.
Mann, principal of the Denman School;
Mies- C. Hall. Miss Ball. James G. Gil
nli^:i, John J. Conlin, Deputy Superin
tendent cf Schools W. Kingsbury. W B
Howard. J. F. Donaldson. Miss N. Har-
Rra\es, Mrs. A. D. Hawley, C. T. Mitch
ell, Mrs. F. H. Fowler and B. Heffernan.
On another occasion, as testified to by
the witness, she was given' a dead fish by
Lyser with instructions to dissect it be
fore her class. She declined to do so on
the ground that such an operation would
be harmful in its effects upon the young
children. She denied that she had ever
struck any pupil on the knuckles with a
ruler, and said that until her dispute with
Miss Lrkson Lyser always spoke of her
to others in a nattering way.
A number of witnesses testified and
their evidence was favorable' to Miss Mc-
Kinney. A number of teachers and pa
rents testified that she had always been
efiicient.
The accused teacher told an interesting
story of Lyser's arbitrary conduct toward
her. At the time of President McKinley's
visit to this citv he was to review th-;
children- of the public schools. The vari
ous classes of the Swett School were told
to form preparatory to marching to the
corner oi \ an Ness avenue and Bust;
street. When Miss McKinney sought to
leave the school after a reprimand from,
Lyser she found the door locked. Mean
while the other classes were on the
march. The imprisoned class made fran
tic efforts to escape and finally succeeded
by forcing the door. When Miss MeKin-
Dey appeared at the rendezvous she re
ported to Lyser, who almost screamed,
"I'll fix you for this!"
LYSES LOCKS UP CLASS.
Miss McKinney went on to say that
Lyser always spoke well of her to every
one until she had a dispute with Miss Erk-
Bon, who taught a class below that of her
own. A nephew of Miss Erkson was in
Miss McKinney's class and the lad com
plained that he was worked too hard.
Lyser began to find fault with her and
frequently reprimanded her before the
class without, however, specifying any
thing in particular.
Miss McKinney testified that she was a
teacher of fifteen and a half years' stand
ing. She was shown the petitions for her
retention as teacher filed by her former
pupils and identified the signatures. The
petitions were circulated'aiter Lyser had
filed his charges against her.
"Are these cnarges true or false?" asked
Attorney McPike.
"Absolutely false," was the reply. "Ly
ser knows they are false." .
"In his charges," resumed McPike,
"Lyser says you have points in teaching
which are far above the average. Is that
true?"
"I must plead guilty to that," replied
the accused teacher.
Miss Mary McKinney, a teacher in the
John Swett Grammar School, who is on
trial by the Board of Education on
charges of incompetence, preferred by
Principal Lyser, took the stand in her
own defense yesterday. She declared that
Lyser's charges were baseless and
prompted by malice. She resented with
emotion his aspersions upon her character
and her description of x his treatment of
her tended to show that Lyser was a
bully, as her counsel stated. The evi
dence heard during the day was favorable
to Miss McKinney and not at all com
plimentary to Lyser. The matter was ar
gued at length and submitted to the
beard for decision.

PAINE'S OEUSBY COMPOUND.
No Respecter of Rank.
Disease Lays Its Heavy Hand
on Kings, Princes, Presidents,
the Noble and
Wealthy, as Well as Those of
Low Estate.
Paine's Celery
Compound
Is the Great Restorer of Health
for the Ruler and His
Humblest Subject.
Sickness, disease and suffering respect
neither ruler nor subject.. The noted and
high born have their trials and physical
sufferings like those in humbler stations.
Social standing and wealth cannot bar the
progress of disease when the common
rules of health are violated.
Impure blood and weak nerves are re-
sponsible for many of the common dis-
eases of life. The experienced physician
will tell you that men and women with
pure, clear coursing blood and well-braced
nerves can never become victims of rheu-
matism, neuralgia, liver troubles, debility,
headaches or sleeplessness.
It follows, therefore, that sufferers from
any of the ailments referred to should at
once take proper measures to cleanse tha
blood and feed the weak nervous system
with proper nourishment.
For the happy accomplishment of thia
important work Paine's Celery Compound
is the only safe agent, the one great spe-
cific, the only security against deadly dis-
ease and death. During these sprlnjf
days Paine's Celery Compound guarantees
a perfect regularity of the bowels, healthy
appetite, sound sleep, good digestion, pure
blood, strong nerves and clear brain, all
of which mean full and robust health.
Mr. E. M. Button, ex-Mayor of Burling-
ton. Vt., one of the strongest and hearti-
est advocates of Paine's Celery Compound
in the United States, tells us in the fol-
lowing letter how he keeps well under all
circumstances. He says:
"People have often asked me how 1
managed to keep so well, for, although
out in nearly all kinds of weather and
traveling considerably, I have no ache3
or sickness. My one answer has been that
instead of waiting until I am sick in bed
and forced to stop work for awhije, when-
ever I feel out of sorts the least bit, I
take Paine's Celery Compound, which
keeps me well and strong. It Is a great
deal better in my opinion to take a medi-
cine that keeps one well rather than to
wait for sickness, and then hunt around
for a medicine or a doctor to cure the
sickness. I have been a hearty advocaze
of Paine's Celery Compound since It was
first made, a great many years ago, and
have yet to hear of a case in which it
falls to fulfill Its promises."

The ' issue affects much more than the question of
raising a revenue. Great Britain is rich, and should
the people reject. the proposed bread tax it will not
be difficult for the Government to find some other

the- duty on grain was expected to do much more
than provide a revenue for immediate uses. It was
looked upon as a first step toward the establishment
of a preferential system of trade between trie mother

servitude upon the Sulu' archipelago, which dimin

The note concludes by saying: "If the rights secured

are rights derived from the contract between the re

Britain,- which contract was in force at the time the

telegrapher's "O. K.," the San Francisco Call
credits it to John Jacob Astor, which is errone
ous, for he got it from ' the chief of the Sac

Back in the 40' s when the old Morse American
Telegraph Company was .slowly- building' its
main line to the westward, a treaty was made
with the chiefs of the Sac, Fox and Potta
watomie tribes of India'ns who occupied a
large portion of the new State of Iowa. Among
the Sac and Fox chiefs, Black Hawk had
ranked highest until after the Black Hawk
war, when the chiefs Old Keokuk and Young

swered in utter brokenness of spirit: "No^
many, moons' a go no land could "have 'gone
.without the name of Black' Hawk, but now
everything is 'O.K., O.K.'.". This saying of
the famous chief was transmitted over the
wires and caught up by the telegraphers as'
a general answer that everything connected
with a telegram had been officially performed,
that, in the words of "Black Hawk, "every
thing was 'O.K.* " The telegraphers not only,
officially adopted Old Keokuk's initials, but
they also called their superiors "chiefs," as
"day chief," "wire chief," etc. If The Call

With the defeat of Mackenzie there is not now a
single boss in the Gage camp who has not been repu
<Â£ated by the people of the community in which he
does politics. Billy Herrin has done his utmost and
the scheme has failed. Perhaps Mackenzie might have
won if Gage had not "butted in." That, however, is
but a matter of speculation. The important thing is
that another boss machine has been wrecked by an
aroused people. Another Gage scheme has been baf
fled. Honest politics has Had another triumph. San
Jose this morning receives the congratulations of all
California. " v
He did not act unwisely in choosing the city elec
tion in San Jose as the scene of the strategic contest.
The county of Santa Clara has been looked upon as
one of his strongholds, and San Jose, the county seat,
was supposed to be under the domination of his gang.
Boss Mackenzie, to whom he intrusted the fight and
whom he appointed Harbor Commissioner, is one of
the ablest and of late has been the most successful of
his lieutenants. Kelly, Burns, Crimmins, Lynch and
Burke arc discredited by repeated defeats in San
Francisco. Mackenzie had hitherto won out. He is
ir command of a strong machine that has been or
ganized for years, and when backed by the railroads
and the Governor it was believed it would be invin
cible. Gage therefore did the best he could for his
bad and failing cause in choosing the San Jose elec
tion as the opportunity for making an Austerlitz. It
has turned out to be a Waterloo. C , : <-K'i
When all things are taken into consideration it is
not strange that Gage should have rushed to the front
and raised his banner in the San Jose fight. The poli
tics of the State had so shaped itself that it was abso
lutely necessary for him to do something. His an
nouncement of himself as a candidate for renomina
tion had been met by a storm of protest from Repub
licans in all parts of the State. The most influential
of Republican journals' from north to south frankly
and emphatically declared against him and plainly
pointed out that his renomination would seriously im
peril the whole ticket. . The rank and file of the party
indorsed the declarations of the press. At the conven
tion of Republican League Clubs his candidacy
found no' support except from the henchmen who
went there to support it. His mean sneer at other
candidates for the Governorship reacted against him
self. His bosses were everywhere repudiated. His
scheme to have delegates to the State convention ap
pointed instead of being elected by the people was
universally condemned. He had therefore nothing to
lose and everything to hope for by entering a fight
which promised results he might claim as a victory
for his henchmen and an indorsement of himself. "
It will not be necessary for any one to carry the
news of the victory to Gage or to Billy Herrin. They
heard it promptly. In fact, it was to them that San
Jose spoke. They intruded themselves into a local
campaign for the purpose of winning a fight that
would encourage their henchmen. When they did so
they thought they had a sure thing and that they
were running no risks. They counted on something
like a walkover, and were ready to exult over it as a
proof that the voters desire the renomination of
Gage and are ready to support his allies.
SAN. JOSE has spoken. Her people have de
clared themselves 6n the side of honest politics.
The bosses and their henchmen have been
routed. It may be that one or two excellent men on
the boss ticket who were given nominations to
strengthen the gang may have won out on the score
of personal popularity, but even if there be such the
reports show that their success will have been attained
by but slight majorities. At every point of the con
test where it was a plain issue between the bosses and
the people, the people have won.
THE VOICE OP SAN JOSE.
The cattle-growers show no sympathy with the
beef trust, but they declare that the rise in the price
of cattle on the hoof is legitimate and the trust
has nothing to do with it, but, on the other hand,
would' be glad to prevent it. If the counter boy
cott be established it will present a very, interesting
economic condition.
The boycott on _ beef -is affecting the cattle
growers, and will ultimately bring down the price
on the hoof. They are expressing themselves rather
plainly on the subject. They are buyers of articles of
Eastern manufacture, said to be controlled by trusts,
but the product of the labor Which is boycotting their
beef. The prices of. these manufactured articles have
advanced more than the 30" per cent rise the farmers
get on the cattle. Wages have, advanced because
farmers pay the increased' price for what labor pro
duces. In this situation -it; isi seriously proposed to
boycott Eastern manufactures". If people can Â¦ ab
stain from beef, there may be abstention from other
things, which will finally reach back to wages.
THE rise in the price^of' beef oa^ the block, for
which thejaeef tiust is held responsible, is pro-,
ducing some interesting results. : The rise is
50 per cent, and the. press has induced such' a^boy
cott as to.materially. reduce consumption. 'But
while the, rise on the-block waV large, the rise on the'
hoof was significant ; for the Western cattle-growers."
Comparing prices on the hoof for 1895 and 1902 the
rise on the hoof is" 30 per cent, so that the cattle
grower is getting more out of the rise to" the "con- ;
sumer than - the beef trust or the retailer. The
Drovers' Yearbook shows a decline in the cattle
supply from Texas and the Western ranges of 61 per
cent between 1895 and 1901. With only 39 per cent,
of that supply left it is evident that the 'demand has
been met by farm-raised cattle in the region east of
the Missouri River. Their production is more costly
than on the ranges, which will account for the rise'
of 30 per cent in their price on the ho.of.
THE MEA.T BOYCOTT.
Mr. Longyear intended to beautify extensively the lake
front about his house, and he did not relish the idea of tracks
crossing his grounds. Two other routes were suggested, but
were refused consideration, v
With the railroad company it was a case of the lake front
A little more than a year ago it was announced that the
Marquette and Southeastern Railroad -was to be built and that
the proposed route would take the line along the front of the
Longyear home. The millionaire at once entered a protest.
Mr. Longyear gives as his reasons for removal .from Mar
quette the need for better educational advantages for his
children and the railroad which is to run near his house.
Mr. Longyear is reputed to be one of; the richest men in
the upper peninsula of Michigan. About twelve years ago he
erected thebig mansion on the lake front at Marquette. He
surrounded it with a stone wall, beautified the grounds and
fitted the house at a vast expenditure. The house JS con
structed of native sandstone and is very elaborately finished,
containing many costly v/orks of art brought from Europe.
: It. will require a special train of fifty, cars to move the
mansion. : It will be taken apart, piece by piece, loaded or
cars, and set up without' alteration on a site which will be
chosen by Mrs. Longyear when she returns from Europe.;
Of course, to build a new mansion would be. a great
deal cheaper, but In a matter of sentiment money is naturally
no object to the modern millionaire. And Mr. Longyear is a
modern, millionaire! .-Â¦â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ â¢ Â¦=Â¦-Â¦ . .
BECAUSE he objects to having a railroad around his
premises, John M. Longyear will move his half-million
dollar. mansion 1 fron- Marquette, Mich., to Brookline,
Boston's famous suburb, says the New York World.
A CHANCE TO SMILE
As he pursued the vocation of a "land looker" the great
possibilities of that sparsely settled country gradually dawned
upon the young man and he set about to take advantage of
them. He succeeded in interesting capital, including' the Ayers
of Philadelphia, it is said, and In that manner eventually be
came the owner of many thousands of acres of land, until
now he is said to be the largest holder of lands in the State.
In selecting the various tracts Mr. Longyear did so with an
eye to their timber and mineral value, and his Judgment
proved sound. The pine and other timbered lands have re
turned him hundreds of thousands of dollars, while on land-t
owned by him the great Norris mine, the Ashland, the Aurora
and other iron properties have been opened and developed and
have yielded him great sums in royalties. .
Mr. Longyear served as Mayor of Marquette in 1S9O-91. and
is a member of the board of control of the Michigan College of
Mines at Houghton, in the copper country.
John M. Longyear was born fifty years ago at Lansing.
Mich. At the age of 15 he wag a clerk iri the Lansing Post
office at a salary of $20 a montn. Later he was employed at a
wood-working establishment and scaled lumber in the Saglnaw
Valley, in 1872 going in the woods as a "land looker."
The next year he went to the upper peninsula of Michigan,
whose resources at that time were little realized.

grant the franchise. The millionaire thereupon secured an in

a vigorous fight in the courts the right of way was condemned

tention beins that the land was actually benefited. The re

In his recent speech before the Primrose League
Lord Salisbury boasted he had not "receded, an

said. he had not advanced an inch. He has not only
learned nothing from the war, but he has riot even
learned that he ought to ;.have learned something.
We don't expect to compete for jerked beef, and
the argument addressed to our domestic beef interest
is just as illusive as that to the cotton interest. Of
course both were expected to antagonize American
sugar planters for the sake of some advantage to
themselves. . . Â¦ .
Our Minister to Argentina in a report says: '"I
am free to say that the cheap livestock from which
tajaso is made can be more advantageously .pur
chased in Argentina than in the United States. Be
sides, I dc not think it. will be very easy to dislodge
tajaso from any tropical market, since it is the only
cheap form in which beef can be kept in that cli
mate for any length of time. It is therefore a trade
that I believe will increase rather than decrease in
Cuba and other tropical islands."
With very great address and cunning the Cuban
junta has arranged its case to appeal to. special and
powerful interests. Place's exaggeration of Cuba's
trade Uri cotton goods was for the purpose of enlist
ing the cotton planters and manufacturers. The
junta has also tried to lure the livestock interests of
this country into alliance by holding out the expecta
tion of a large beef export to the island. No reduc
tion in duty will benefit our fresh beef export, for
the reason that Cubans use "tajaso," or jerked beef,
the only form in which the meat keeps any length of
time in . that climate.
It is hardly possible for Congress or any commit
tee thereof to take fiom other duties the time re
quired for such examination. The statements already,
before the Ways and Means Committee of the House
and the Finance Committee of the Senate are so con
flicting as to make it impossible for Congress to. 1
analyze them and extract the exact facts from such
a mass. Before Congress acts it should have these
facts, or it will b,e in danger of taking a false step, the
retreat from which will be difficult and perhaps hu
miliating. \
He also said that Cuba's import of cotton goods
was $67,ooo/xx>, whereas the statistics show that it
was only $7,000,000 from all countries.
In 1891, under reciprocity, we took from Cuba in
imports $61,073,621, -and she took from us $24,157,
698. In 1901 we imported from Cuba $46,663,511, and
exported to her $28,561,140, or four millions more
than in the best year of reciprocity.
These figures expose the sy*cm of exaggeration
and misstatement by which free trade is being urged.
They show, that a mistake will be made if that policy
is adopted as a result of such arguments. It is.cvi
dent that the policy of the Washington reciprocity
convention was wise, not only in stating the princi
ple upon which reciprocity should rest, but also in
demanding 'an impartial and expert examination of
the whole subject before anything is done.
In the hearings before the Ways and Means Com
mittee of the House during this session Mr. Place,
the Cuban representative, said that the island im
ported from the United States, in the period of
1891-94, during reciprocity, from $35,000,000 " to
$40,000,000 in machinery. Our Treasury Bureau* of
Statistics shows that during that* period we exported
to Cuba enly $7,649,752 in machinery, and in steam
engines and their parts only $2,655,788, making a
total of only $10,325,540, or one-fourth of Place's
figures!
Last November the representatives of every
American industry met in .Washington to consider
the question- of-reciprocity on the lines of President
McKinley's Buffalo speech, the last and among. the
greatest , of his public utterances. That convention
expressed its purpose and conclusion by- resolving:
''That this convention recommends to Congress the_
maintenance of the principle of protection for the
home market, and to open up by reciprocity oppor
tunities for increased foreign trade by* special, modifi
cations of the tariff; in special cases, but only when
it can be done without injury to any of our home
interests, of manufacturing, commerce or farming.".
To ascertain what modifications might be made with
benefit and without injury the convention recom
mended a tariff commission of experts to report upon
such modifications.
THE proposition to favor Cuban commerce by
free trade or a modification of our tariff upon
competing products is more profoundly affect
ing our. domestic politics than . any other question
now in focus. Throughout the discussion of this
policy it- has been the aim oP The Call to furfcjsh
the exact facts, to the end that the people may ao
whatever is finally done with their eyes op*en. From
the Cuban side v the desired legislation has been
urged by concealing or exaggerating the facts.

It is not strange that the British people should at

undertake a part' of the defense of the empire with
out asking special ; favors in return. Neither; Canada

look.to Great Britain to prptect them in case of war.
The British taxpayer thus finds himself burdened with
heavy taxes to protect colonies that pay little or

the royal navy for. the ensuing year is about $170,

will give you in our home markets a freedom' of trade'
denied to foreign powers." To large wheat export
ing countries like Australia and Canada such an of
fer wolild have been valuable, and it is possible it
might have been accepted. An offer of the Ministry,
however, is worth nothing unless the people are be
hind it, snd consequently the result of the Bury
election is quite' an important factor in the imperial
problem. It seems tq. imply that when the Ministers
ask the colonial Premiers to bear a portion of the
burdens of the empire they will have nothing of

On her voyage from Philadelphia to Hlogo
the Garnet Hill encountered a hurricane, dur
ing which she had a narrow escape from de
struction. A large spare spar got- adrift on
deck and held possession of the works for four
hours. It was finally secured, but not before
it had rammed ( holes into everything break
able and jeopardizing the life and limbs of the
men that fought to make it fast. It knocked
ling bolts out of the deck and started the
hatch combings and it was with a sigh of re
lief that the mate reported to, the skipper, "All
fast, sir."
The British ships Garnet Hill and Queen
Victoria, which arrived from the Orient on
Saturday and Sunday^respectlvely, crossed the
Pacific at steamship speed and established
records for fast sailing that windjammers will
havÂ«; difficulty In bettering. v The Queen Vic
toria was thirty days coming from Shanghai.
She was out seven days before getting a wind
to. take her well off shore. When she found
her wind she made the most of it. The Gar
net Hill made her best run on the last day of
the voyage, when she logged 315 nautical miles
Shs left Hlogo April 23, but it was not until
April 30 that she began to travel. That date

made over sixteen knots. . .

The feature of last night's entertain
n;ent was a drill by Company C, First
Imantry Regiment. N. G. C. The soldier
boys executed their maneuvers in excel
lent style and were heartily applauded
as they marched and countermarched up
and down the floor of the Pavilion. The
soldiers with- their martial equipments
and their fluttering banners furnished a
very picturesque scene when taken in
conjunction with the historic towers and
embattled castles of Ireland. Colonel
Thomas F. O'Neil and staff were also in
attendance at the fair.
The "Woodmen of the World will be
present to witness the festivities. Enter
tainments will also be given by Water
fcrd. Queens and Tipperary booths.
The celebrations at the booths last
night were under the auspices of Tyrone,
Louth and Mayo counties. At Mayo booth
the visitors had a chance to inspect a
numter of relics brought over from Ire
land. Among, the articles on display at
this booth is a beautiful doll called . "The
Lass from the County Mayo." It was
purchased especially for the Mayo booth
by Miss Margaret Shiels while she was
on a visit recently to Ireland.
programme consisted of vocal and instru
mental music and a discourse in Gaelic.
Never had a reigning? sovereign more
loyal or merrier subjects than' are those
who to-night acknowledge allegiance to
Queen Rita Curtis when she fs crowned
to rule over the - carnival at the Irish
Fair. She will be able "to look' down from
her throne of honor and count among her
people representatives 'from every county
of Ireland.- It is no matter of wonder
that the natives of Cork are rejoicing that
one of their fair daughters has been elect
ed Queen.
All is in readiness for the great carnjpal.
Queen Rita, who is a sister of Supervisor
Curtis, spent yesterday in selecting her
maids of honor. Her coronation robes
will be made of white. If has been de
cided by the committee in charge of the
carnival that there shall be a, parade
around the hall. It will be in the nature
of a triumphal promenade in honor of the
newly crowned queen. All the ladies who
have been working so incessantly for the
success of the\ booths will' join in the
parade. The carnival to-night will in all
probability be the most spectacular event
of the fair.

While the shooting was in progress the
wives and daughters of the members en
joyed dancing In the pavilion. Ackmann's
band rendered excellent dance music. The
ladies were given an opportunity to dis
play their skill by launching a wooden
duck with a pointed bill against a target.
D. B. Faktor watched the flight of the
bird. "Dick" Dunker, the popular secre
tary of the Verein, kept tab on the-shots;
William Morken ran a roulette wheel
without befng "pinched"; Alec Pape
knocked' over the golden cross that
f crmed a part of the scepter, but* imag
ined-he-was "double crossed,";' as he got
no prize. Phllo Jacobi was very facetious
during the. contest. Every time a friend
would step up to win the "king" prize he
would yell for "moosic." The success of
the affair was due to the efforts of the
following committee: Â¦â¢

The committee then unscrewed the steel
plate which protected the eagle's body
and the firing began for first honors.
Nearly an hour was devoted to chipping
pieces off the targets Ed Aigeltlnger got
a generous piece of the mark, but it would
not drop.
It was the forty-third anniversary of
the organization. The members dressed
in their natty uniforms and carrying their
trusty rifles marched to the ferry in the
morning and journeyed to Shell Mound
Park. As soon as they arrived the stren
uous work of the day was taken up. The
gayly painted wooden eagle was left to
the mercy of the experts. " Louis Barner
was first to score. He leveled the crown.
Fred Ratjens toppled the head over;
Frank Koch landed the apple; John Gif
ken landed the scepter; Charles Thier
bach scored the left claw, and Herman
Huber dropped the other claw. The ex
perts then devoted their attention to the
left wing. They peppered holes in it un
til it resembled a sieve. August Eggert
locsened it, but the wing did not drop
until Fred Schuster, one of the best shots
in the crowd, had his gun sighted at the
mark. Had he fired while the wing was
falling he would have been entitled to
the prize, but like a magnanimous sports
man he, refused to take the advantage.
He; was cheered.. This bit' of sportsman
ship was one of the features of the day.
Captain John Thode dropped the right
wing seven minutes later. â¢

there was, tremendous cheering. Lilkeh
dey was congratulated and then hoisted
onl'a chair, .which in turn rested on a
table. The band was brought from the
pavilion and the lucky sharpshooter was
escorted in state to the dance hall, where
he was crowned with a floral wreath by
Miss Thode.- He repaid the fair lady
with 'a royal salute on' the 'lips, 'and the
crowd yelled approval. Mr. Lilkendey
was at a loss for words and therefore in
vited his brother members to "have a
smile with him." Before' the company
returned to this city the "smile" devel
oped into a well defined laugh, which was
evidence that the "king" was a generous
hest.

The number of candidates under the
care of the board during the year was 572.
The income was scarcely sufficient to pro
vide for them, and the report points out
that if there should be an increase of,
say, 100 next year there would be no little
anxiety with regard to the $10,000 which
would be needed for the emergency.
There was received by legacies during
the year $2479. The amount paid to can
didates this year is $55,530, as compared
with $46,433 last year. Under the circum
stances it has not been possible to make
any additions to the reserve fund. The
board believes the publication of the view
that the church has too many ministers
already, fortified by statistics tending to
show that there are a large number of
â¢ capable ministers upon the roll beyond
existing opportunities for service, have
made considerable impression and must
be reckoned with as among the causes
which discourage young men from devot
ing their lives to work in the sacred of
fire.
The following measures are urged upon
In its eighty-third annual report the
board of education announces that all the
financial engagements of the year have
been met without incurring any debt, but
there is a somewhat diminished balance.
The receipts from the churches, Sabbath-
Bchools and young people's societies
amounted to $44,170, as compared witfc
$43,040 last year. Only the fact that the
number of candidates enrolled for the
year was abnormally small made it pos
sible to carry out the purpose to make a
better provision for them than In recent
years. $100 being given to students in the
collegiate and seminary courses and $90
to students in the preparatory course.
This is the highest rate paid since 1834.
The report of the freedmen's board,
Â¦with the Rev. Dr. McGonigle's comment.
.was accepted and adopted.
Nearly 11,000 pupils have come under
Presbyterian instruction, and the number
of churches and missions has increased
from 342 to 5S2.
The treasurer's report shows receipts
from all sources during the year ended
March 31, 1302, '-were $lNo,SOA. After all ex
penditures were deducted there remained
a balance of J1057. The report does not in
clude in any way the $$8,254 contributed
by churches and schools for support.
Rev. Dr. E. P. Cowan, corresponding
secretary and treasurer of the board of
freedmen. addressing the assembly said
the Presbyterian church would have to
bestir itself and do its share of the work
among the freedmen if the day was to be
ushered in when the freedmen could take
tfciir stand not only as political but as
spiritual equals of the whites.
Rev. John N. McGonigle of St. Augus
tine, Fla., also made an appeal for the
freedmen's mission. The average eolore-3
preacher in the South was ignorant. He
offered an amendment to the report of
the standing committee recommending
that the contributions of the church to
the freedmen's work be increased 50 per
cent.
More money was received during the
year than for any similar period in eight
years.

The crime was discovered by John Kel
ler, who found the six corpses, scarcely
cold, and the only living witness to the
tragedyâ a helpless infant. Austin had
been madly infatuated with the McCul
loch girl,' and, it' is said, killed the family
because his advances were rejected. Aus
tin went to the Wilkinson home Friday
night and proposed marriage. He was re
jected, but vowing he would marry the
girl, hurried to this city and procured a
license. He went to church on Sunday
afternoon and told eveiy one whom he
met that he was to be married that night.
About 7 o'clock this morning several shots
were heard, but no investigation was
made. When Wilkinson failed to appear
for work at a neighbor's, where he was
engaged in harvesting a crop of pota
toes, John Keller, a farmhand, was sent
for him and discovered the tragedy.

WOODLAND, May 19.â Mrs. Benjamin
ofOroville, a delegate to the Woman's
Convention in Woodland, last Saturday
prevented a despondent young man com
mitting suicide. While she was with a
party of ladies out driving they came
upon a genteel. and well dressed young
man, who was lying beside the railroad
tank. As they approached he drew a re
volver and was in the act of pressing the
muzzle to his head when Mrs. Benjamin
cried, "Hold!" with such a show of com
mand that he hesitated long enough for
her to reach his side.
To her inquiries he replied that he was
tired of a misspent life and ashamed of
the disgrace he has brought upon his par
ents and intended to end it all. Mrs. Ben
jamin talked kindly, to him, offered to help
him and finally persuaded him to give up
his pistol. She told him he might have it
again when he had recovered from his de
spondency.
The stranger, who gave his name as
Hobson, said he never wanted to see the
pistol again. As the ladies drove away he
feelingly thanked Mrs. Benjamin and
promised to lead a better life.

" Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â Your Vegetable Compound cured me i
Â«f ulcention of the womb, and getting such a complete cure I felt that 1
the medicine had genuine merit and was well worth recommending
to other sick women.
" For fifteen years I have been your friend. I have never written you
before, but I have advised hundreds of women to take your medicine, in
fact it is the only real reliable remedy I know of for a sick woman, j
" I have not yet found a case of ovarian or womb trouble which
has not been relieved or cured by the faithful use of Lydia E.
Pinkhamjs Vegetable Compound.
" You have brought health.to hundreds of women in Minneapolis as
you have no doubt to others over the country." â Mrs. Ellen Ripley.

When women are 'troubled with irregular or painful menstruation,
weakness, leucorrhcea, displacement or ulceration of the womb, that bear-
ing-down feeling, inflammation of the ovaries, backache, flatulence,
general debility, indigestion, and nervous prostration, they should
remember there is one tried and true remedy. T^ydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles.
, No other medicine in the world has received such widespread and
unqualified endorsement. "No other medicine has such a record of curea
of female troubles. Refuse to buy any other medicine.

and connects with the main shaft. Before
he had fully cleared the belt he evidently
raised from the stooping posture he had
assumed in the narrow passage. The belt
struck him on the head and hurled him
many feet. His head struck some heavy,

Professor Schaefer was 55 years of age,
of scholarly attainments and had been
employed in the academy ten years. He
had not been re-engaged for the coming
year, and it is supposed that this caused
his despondency. Professor Schaefer
came from Bethlehem, Pa., and for some

Judging by the action of the union during
the last strike, when efforts were made
to stop the shipment of soft coal Into an
thracite territory, it is not unlikely that
the miners may take similar action within
the next few days.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., May 19.âPresi
dent John Mitchell of the United Mine
Workers of America arrived here from
Hazleton shortly after 9. o'clock to-night
and established strike headquarters at
the Hotel Hart. The national president
stated that so far as the miners' side of
the controversy was concerned the situ
ation had not changed In the least.
Mitchell's attention was called to tho
fact that the city of Philadelphia had
contracted for a supply of bituminous
coal to take the place of the anthracite
which had been cut off by the railroad
companies furnishing it. In reply to a
que&tion as to whether the mine workers
would attempt to prevent the shipment of
soft coal to places where hard coal Is
used, he said:
"Considering the proposition in a, gen
eral way, I will say that we do not desire
to make any city a victim or have any
person suffer because of our quarrel with

He was pressfd for a more explicit
statement, but refused to go in it any
deeper, except to say that it was a mat
ter which would have to be settled by the
three executive boards of the anthracite
fields.
The conference report was agreed to.
Perkins. Warren and Tillman were ap
r-ointed conferees on the fortifications ap
propriation bill.
The Senate, at 2:05 p. m., on motion of
Lodsre, went into executive session, and
at 3:25 p. m. adjourned.
Hoar declared that It was Just as dis
reputable on the part of a great and rich
Government like the United States to re
fuse to pay these claims as It would be
for him or any other Senator to refuse
to pay for a house he had ordered built.
Warren explained that the Selfridge
board claims had been omitted from the
bill, the House refusing to agree to them.
Warren then presented the conference
report on the omnibus claims bill. The
report shows that the House had agreed
to $1,405,393 of the amount added by .the
Senate, so that the amount carried by the
measure as agreed to Is ?1,618,498.
"The Congress of the United States is
more likely to cede back the valley of the
Mississippi to the lawful heirs of Napo
leon the Great than to leave the Philip
pine archipelago to become the prey of
anarchy or the prize of some European
power."
In conclusion Dolliver said;
OMNIBUS CLAIMS BILL.
Dclliver then paid a beautiful tribute to
thÂ«- late President McKinley and his pol
icy in the Philippines, saying that in Mc-
Kinley's policy there was not a note of
gieed or covetousness. He (Dolliver) had
tcund it difficult, as he had heard the
terms "thieves," "murderers," "plunder
ers"' and "carpet-baggers" flung reckless
ly from the lips of Democratic statesmen,
to determine just where he was â whether
he really was in the Senate of the United
Slates. William McKinley had put the
stal of his approval upon the holding of
the Philippines by the United States in
trust for their inhabitants. And, he said,
the action of McKiniey was pregnant
with greatness and humanity. He said,
the Philippine Insurrection as a military
preposition, was- a -thing of- the past- -
Dolliver declared that no Republican on
party grounds would ask for a cessation
of hostilities in the Senate, for every man
must know that no political advantage
could be gained by an attack upon the
array of the United States.
The charge has been made, he said,
that the Government had entered upon a
wicked conspiracy against ten million peo
ple. He had listened to the malicious
Ura.de through which an attempt has been
made to impeach the members of this
Government. He was satisfied that the
party in power could make its way
through this volcano of malevolence and
rualicC without harm to it.
A bill providing for the retirement of
Surgeon General Sternberc as a major
Â£â¬iieral was passed. At the conclusion of
routine business consideration was re
sumed of the Philippine government bill.
Dolliver of Iowa addressed the Senate in
support of the measure. He said the
pending bill presented the most important
and comprehensive work since the Civil
War. And yet, he said, he was disap
pointed that not a single helpful sugges
tion had been made by the minority.
They had satisfied themselves with a
thunderstorm that sounded loud, but in
effect amounted to little. He suggested
that the Democrats had evinced a studied
avoidance of the real matter in hand.
STERNBERG TO RETIRE.
A partial disagreement on tne omnibus
claims bill was reported and the bill again
stnt to conference.
A joint resolution was offered by Stew
art and adopted providing that that part
cf the Indian appropriation bill, wnich
relates to subjecting to entry certain
mining lands in the Spokane Indian res
ervation shall take effect when the allot
ments to the Indians are completed.
The letter of the French Government,
tranfcmitted through Embassador Choate
to the Secretary of State, expressing the
thanks of that Government for the sym
pathy evinced in the United States to
ward the volcano sufferers, was laid be
fore the Senate and referred to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.
WASHINGTON, May 19.-Only a brief
time was devoted by the Senate to-day
tc consideration of the Philippine govern
ment bill. Dolliver of Iowa supported the
bill, which, he said, was one of the most
important pieces of constructive legisla
tion presented since the Civil War. He
arraigned the Democratic minority for Its
opposition to the measure. He Insisted
that the Philippine insurrection, as a mil
itary proposition, was a thing of the past,
and declared that under no circumstances
would the United States relinquish the
Philippines.

The question of whether Mrs. Carolina

deathbed statement of Mrs. Marsellia.
which will probably go far toward set
tling this question, and yet he absolutely
refused to-night to state to the Coroner
y/hat the woman had told him. As a re
sult of this refusal Coroner Mehrmann
placed Dr. Gladding under arrest and or
dered him to appear for sentence on Fri
day evening for contempt of the Coroner.
Coroner Mehrmann supports the autop
sy physicians, Drs. F. H. Payne and Hu
bert N. Rowell, 'that the bruises and rup
tures were ante-mortem, and does not
credit the statement made by Dr. Glad
ding that these marks were post-mortem.
Meanwhile Frank Lewis, who is other

NEW YORK, May 19.â The Staten Isl
and ferry-boat Middletown was in collision
with the steam yacht Aileen this morn
ing. The ferry-boat's cabin waa badly
damaged and J. C. Atterbury of New
Brighton, Staten Island, a passenger on
the Middletown, was killed. The ferry
steamer was loaded with passengers and
the collision created a great deal of ex
citement,' but no one else has been re
ported hurt. Both vessels were bound
up the bay when the yacht suddenly ap
peared out of the fog and struck the ferry
boat on the starboard side, just forward
of the wheelbouse. The bowsprit of the
vacht penetrated the men's cabin and
was broken off. Beyond this the yacht
apparently sustained no further damage
and proceeded on her .way. The Aileen
belongs to Richard Stevens of the New
York Yacht Club. Â¦ â "
The ferry-boat Mauch Chunk of the
Central Railroad of New Jersey collided
with a railroad float off the Battery to
day. The Mauch Chunk had a number or
passengers aboard and her captain did
not back out from the float for fear that
the water would rush in at the hole made
by the collision. The float and ferry-boat
drifted down the bay together, and as
there was a heavy fog were soon lost to
sight from shore. The ferry-boats East
ern and Castleton went out to stand by
the Mauch Chunk and take off the pas
sengers if necessary. *
All the passengers were taken, off the
Mauch Chunk by the Eastern and were
landed in Jersey City. â¢ No one was hurt.
The float which collided with the Mauch
Chunk belonged to the Baltimore and
Ohio Railread. It was being towed by
the tug Eliconirie. There were about fifty
passengers on the ferry-boat, and for a
time there was much excitement.

George F. Chapman of Newark, N. J.,
Will Possibly Be the New
Manager.
The successor of. E. P. Vining as man
ager of the United Railroads will be ap
pointed by the directors on Friday. It is
generally known that George F. Chapman,
who resigned his position with the New
aik (N. J.) Streetcar Company, will be
appointed to the post. â¢
Acting President Holland says that to
announce the successor of E. P. Vining
at this time would be- ill-advised, as no
Â¦action has yet. been taken by the direc
tors of the road. From his remarks, how
over, it could be clearly understood that
George F. Chapman is Holland's choice.
In answer to a question as to when the
all-night car service would go into effect
President Holland said the matter was
receiving careful consideration, and it
would be a question of only a short time
when the company would come to a final
decision.

King, the convict preacher, and Harry

The board will meet, next Friday night
to consider the budget, when citizens will
be heard, and to consider the proposition
to hold a speciaj election to submit a
charter amendment providing for the sub
mission of all proposed bonded improve
ments in one election.
With the growing needs of the departments,
particularly the school, fire and police depart
ments, it is becoming yearly more difficult to
set money aside for permanent improvements
under the dollar limit As It Is possible that
the assessment roll may exceed your commit
tee's estimate and that there may be a small
surplus we recommend that your board make
a special appropriation for Improvements of
say $200,000 In addition to the estimate on
$405,000,000. We strongly indorse the resolu
tion to set aside $6500 to open Lyon etreet.
Your committee has heard many applica
tions from property owners and improvement
clubs and has decided to make no recommen
dation, but to refer the requests to the board
so that the money avgailable for Improvements
may be apportioned In the most suitable man
ner.

The appropriation of the Board of Public
Works is $778,097. against $827,200 last year.
.The board asked for $1,977,606. The recapitu
lation follows:
EOARD OF WORKS CUT.
The committee makes no recommendation in
the School Department estimate for new con
struction, but has allowed for salaries, ex
penses and repairs $1,275,000, and for main
tenance of the playground $5000; total, $1,280,-*
000. Last year's appropriation was $1,295,220,
of which $50,000 was for construction. The
department will receive from the State nearly
$100,000 in excess of the amount estimated at
the time of making the tax levy, bo that there
are ample funds on hand for maintenance.
Tour committee believes that the construction
of modern school houses is not possible under
the limitations of the charter, and if the com
munity desires them lt v must either approve
of an extra tax .levy or ' issue bonds for the
purpose.
The Fire Department asked for $739,420,
against $632,350 last year. The sum of $700,
000 is recommended. The Department of Elec

â¢WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
FORECAST.
The pressure has steadily fallen over Arizona
and Southern California and has fallen slightly
Along the coast from San Francisco to Cape
Blanco. The marked disturbance over the
Rocky Mountain region, and extending south
ward over the valley of the Colorado, is moving
very slowly eastward. Enow is falling in
Northern Arizona, and eastbound travelers over
the central and southern routes will experience
colder weather than by the northern routes.
High winds prevail generally east of the
Â£ terras.
The temperature is 20 degrees below the nor
mal throughout Arizona and Utah. In the great
?alleys of California the temperatures are
about 10 degrees below the normal.
A trace of rain has fallen at Los Angeles.
Forecast made at San Francisco for thirty
hours ending midnight. May 20, 1902:
Northern California â Fair/ Tuesday, with
showers in the foothills and mountains; brisk
northerly winds in the interior; brisk westerly
wlnde on the coant; warmer. V
CHICAGO. May 19.â The outside interest
kept out of the wheat market to-day and
thUB brought general apathy among the traders
All the English markets were closed because of
holidays, consequently there were no cables
ti- figure upon. In addition to the bearish feeiinc
that would naturally result from this dullness
weather reports showed good rains all over tha
winder wheat country and warm weather to
help growth. Northwestern points reported
more flooding rains in the spring wheat coun
try, but the bullish lifluence of these advices
was offset by the expectation that the fine
wtather conditions in the winter wheat would
n-.cre than make up the- difference in
late spring seeding. Country offerings were in
creasing. There was a general bearish feeling
prevalent in the pit. but the trade changed its
views on the relative merits of the July and
Septtmber options, the difference being nar
rowed to lc. July opened a shade lower to a
shade- highor at 74%@74%c, and on a small
selling pressure declined to 74'/4c rallying to
74%Â«!774%c. where It closed, 14c lower than
Saturday.
The corn market ruled rather weak on the
Ideal weather conditions. July closed %Â©Vic
down at 61%@61%c. , ?Zz*Â°
Oats ruled dull and easy. July closed easy,
%c lower, at 3G%c.
Provisions felt the weakening influence of
outside liquidation and an absence of good
support. July pork closed 10c down, lard 5@
7%c lower and ribs a shade under Saturday.

"In raisins a little firmness is noted in Cali
fornia loose, with occasional business in 3
crown grade at 6%c. Seeded raisins are steady,
but quiet on the quoted basis. Valencia layer
raisins are quiet but firm. In apricots and
peaches the interest is jobbing in character and
prices remain steady. For future apricots there
la little interest. Sellers' views on the coast
are lower. In dates and figs the market is
fairly steady, but no unusual activity is re
ported at the moment. In nuts through the
list a quiet jobbing interest prevails. Brazil
r.uts are in fair request and steady. Shelled
nuts show no particular feature, but a slightly
firmer feeling is noted on both almonds and
walnuts in sympathy with late advices from
the primary markets."
"1\ is stated that the purchase was not en
tii-elj* speculative, the buyer having an outlet
for the fruit in export channels. The move
ment for export in the past two weeks has been
active, and the aggregate gales are figured by
conservative- interests to have been in excess
of thirty carloads. The spot market is fairly
steady on the e^c basis for 40-50s in 25-lb
boxes, and a fair movement for export .account
is noted chiefly in large sizes. The aggregate
movement for export in the last two weeks
covers around 30 carloads. Small prunes and
old fruit are quiet and Ehow no particular
strength. .

delphia Interest was reported to-day. The
fruit was sold to come here, the purchaser be
ing the buyer of the six- carloads reported sold
here yesterday. The fruit was composed of
sixes 40-SOs and 50-60s in 25-lb boxes, the
price paid being withheld and said to have
been a shade under 6%c basis for 40-00s in
S5-lb boxes. It, is stated that the two pur
chases referred to clean up the block of asso
ciation prunes that have been offered here for
some time, and the removal of the- lot from
offering has strengthened the position of the
article 60 far as large size* are concerned. At
the moment 1901 crop Santa Clara fruit in 25
lb bcxes is not available under ti'^c for 40-UOs
in a jobbing way, this basis being quoted
down on the large sizes.

changed, in spite of last week's enormous loan
decrease by the banks themselves, detracted
from the sentimental relief that would other
wise have been /elt by the loan showing. There
was a significant stiffening of the foreign, ex
change rate also, which indicates that a high
level of interest rates is all that diverts credits
to the New York market. The opinion is still
held that even a slight relaxation in interest
rates would lead to early withdrawals of gold
from New York. The largest borrowings
abroad, as well as the present level of prices of
securities, are felt to be based on a favorable
outcome of the corn crop, whose fate is prob
lematical yet. The securing of loans abroad is
an evidence of the resources of the country's
credit, but the domestic level of interest rates
which has to be paid offers a notable margin
over the prevailing rate in foreign markets and
mutt represent some element of risk In the
minds of the lenders. There were some violent
relapses of prices of high-priced stocks. Inter
national Power dropped back 18 points again
on nominal sales. The market closed dull and
heavy.
Bonds were dull and heavy throughout. To
tal sales, par value, $1,955,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The general packing of the past several
weeks 1 has materially reduced,, the supply,, of
Butter, and the market is reported steadier in
consequence, with perceptible firmness in the
upper grades of creameries. Prices, however,
show no improvement as yet.
. Cheese continues weak and plentiful.
__ Receipts of Eggs continue to fall cjf, but
this is largely offset by the decreased demand
usual at this time of the year, when people be
gin to leave town. The Alaska orders men
ticned last week have been almost filled The
majority of dealers say that they can get 19o
for an occasional box or two of fine large se
lected ranch, but this figure is hardly general
enough for a quotation. .The Exchange reduced
its quotations to lC@17&c for ranch and 15M>@
16c<for gathered.
Receipts were 33,500 pounds and 191 tubs of
Butter, 1210 cases of Eggs; â¢ cases of East

Eastcrn Livestock Market,
NEW TOKK, May 10. â There was a dull and
professional market to-daj\ with a sagging ten
dency, running to acute weakness at times of
one or two points. Covering by room shorts
caused some slight Improvement during the
final hour, but the tone became heavy again
cv.i cksrd so. The recent factors of depression
-nw-Inuecl In force, namely, the uncertainty
orrt- Â«:^ t-ect of the anthracite miners' strike,
the situation in the local money market and the
crcp outluok. There v.*as some irregularity in
the oi>ening dealings end the hard and soft
c<"Â»Â»lfcrs made eor.e stand against depression.
Ti'e craln carriers, on the other hand, were
weak a!i(3 made guile sharp declines of a point
01 more. The reiwrla of heavy rains In the
ICortiiv.'eet were considered unfavorable . for
epring whrat. but the weather in the Southwest
nu K'-'U and winter wheat was reported doing
ivdi. This weakni-ES permeated the list pretty
generally. There v.-aÂ« notable selling r,l the
Vr.itcd' Statew Etcel slocks, which seemed to
Eein force when announcement was made of
Hi-* several protean presented at the rtockhold

Bribery and Unearths Much
Crookedness.
OFFICIALS OF TOLEDO
ABE UNDER INDICTMENT
Grand Jury Investigates Charges of
The Chief Justice and Justice McKenna
dissented, and Justices Gray and Brewer
took no part in the case.
"We hold that the court-martial was a
wholly illegal body and that it had no
jurisdiction whatever."
The United States, in the name of the
warden of the Fort Leavenworth peniten
tiary, appealed the case to the Supreme
Court of the United States./
In delivering his opinion Justice Peck
ham said?
Justice Peckham reviewed briefly the
circumstances of the case, saying that
Deming had pleaded guilty to the charge
of embezzlement and to conduct unbecom
ing an officer during his trial, and that
the court-martial had been ordered by the
major general in command; that he had
been found guilty and sentenced to dis
missal i from the army and to imprison
ment. He then told how Demlng had
been imprisoned at Fort Leavenworth
and had sued out a writ of habeas corpus
to the United States District Court of
Kansas on the ground that the members
of the court were the representatives of
"other forces," contrary to the require
ments of the articles of war, and asking
for his discharge. The court refused to
grant the discharge, but when the case
was taken te> the Circuit Court of Ap
peals for the. Eighth Circuit the writ was
allowed and the discharge granted.
WASHINGTON, May 19.â In an opinion
delivered to-day by Justice Peckham the
United States Supreme Court decided the
case of Captain Peter C. Demlng In that
officer's favor. The case â¢ involved tha
right of a court-martial composed entire
ly of officers of the regular army to pass
upon a case involving the rights of a vol
unteer officer. The effect of the opinion is
that such a trial is illegal.
Senator Patterson read a letter from
W. S. Sniffin of Boston concerning the
letter of a son of the Rev. Mr. "\yalker,
serving in the Philippines, in which it
was stated that he had given the details
of . the killing of 1000 Filipinos. Sniflln
said that, notwithstanding Walker's de
nial, there was in his conduct and state
ments justification for the newspaper re
portj . '
I presume there were about 25,000 troops in
my command, first and last, and I am certain
that not one of them can truthfully assert that
I ever consciously, verbally or in writing, di
rectly or. indirectly, by sign or signal, author
ized, instructed or ordered any of them to use
the so-called water cure, in any form or any
character whatever.
Before O'Brien took the witness stand
Chairman Lodge laid before the commit
tee a letter from General R. P. Hughes.
In his letter General Hughes inclosed a
roster of officers in his command, whom
he said he would like to. have summoned
if his conduct was to be Inquired Into.
Continuing, the letter said: .
Corporal O'Brien described the capture
of La nag in Panay, when a sentry, fired
at a native boy on a caraboo. He missed,
then all the soldiers fired, himself in
cluded. This was not done by orders. The
shooting brought the people to their doors.
One old man was shot in the 'abdomen.
Two other old men came out with a white
flag and both were shot down. Upon close
questioning Corporal O'Brien admitted
that he had seen many prisoners and they
were treated kindly by both officers and
men. He will give further testimony to
morrow. - â¢ .
. Corporal Richard O'Brien, formerly of
the Twenty-sixth Volunteer Infantry, tes
tified to seeing the "water cure" adminis
tered. At Iloilo, he said, three officers-
Major Cook, Captain McDonald and Lieu
tenant Plumber of Company Bâ became
intoxicated at a reception, took off their
coats, seized some of the native women
and insisted upon their dancing with
them, much to the disgust of the women,
who were above the peasant class. He
said he was not on good terms with hi3
captain. He said also that at one place
a woman with two children was burned to
death in a bamboo shack when the troops
were burning the town. Dum-dum, or ex
plosive bullets, he stated, were issued to
the troop3 in the regular way and did
horrible execution. There were "unwrit
ten orders to take no,,prisoners," which
were " carried out in vthe campaign. He
did not know who issued the orders, but
they were understood to be in effect.
WASHINGTON, May 19.â During the
Philippine investigation before the Senate
Committee to-day a letter was read from
General Hughes denying that he had ever
given orders for the "water cure," and
saying that if such a. charge was made
he wanted the fullest investigation of it.

Norton says he proposes to go ahead
and have the wharves finished in his own
Blyle. The Harbor Commissioners will
begin an investigation to-day and Norton
may hear "something drop" other than
the sound of concrete falling in water
filled cylinders. -.-â¢-â¢> :
"The use of a spout by the engineer,"
said the expert, "to dump concrete be
neath the water in the cylinders is a
farce of a most pronounced kind. The
only way to secure a solid concrete col
umn in the cylinders is to pump the struc
tures dry and then fill them with con
crete."
If below this depth the concrete work
fell apart and exposed the piles to the
teredo only the constant examination by
divers could detect any damage to the
piles. Should the teredoes destroy the in
ner piies far down in the water the dam
age would not b* noticed and the wharves
might tumble into the bay. . .
He explained that when the teredoes de
stroyed the outer wooden casing of the
cylinders the concrete work would
crumble away and expose the inner piles
to the teredoes. As the top of the cylin
ders consists of good concrete work- for a
depth of seven or eight feet, that portion
would remain intact.
AN EXPEBT EXPLAINS.
One of the m6st expert engineers in the
State, thoroughly familiar with cylinder
concrete work, stated last evening that if
tlÂ«e cylinders on the new wharves were
filled In the manner allowed by Norton
there would be danger of . the struc
tures collapsing In the future. â¢ â¢ . ' '
Chief Engineer Norton was asked what
would be the effect of dumping concrete
through water. He declined to answer the
question at first. Finally he gave the an
swer that the concrete would settle in
layers of rock, sand and cement.
thus in pocket $5760 by the kindness of
Chief Engineer Norton altering the speci
fications. The labor of putting the metal
cylinders in place is estimated at
half the cost of the material. Con
tractor Wakefleld therefore saves nearly
$9000 on the item of the metal work alone.
It will be Interesting to note If Wakefleld
will give the State credit for this saving
and deduct the amount from his contract
warrants of $360,000.
As to the charge made that Wakefleld
has used some old lumber and scrap iron
spikes on planking," Norton says that he
knows nothing of the same. He says that
the inspector in charge should be in a
position to see if anything of the kind
ever took place. The Harbor Commission
ers will question the inspector to-day.
Before this is done, however, the Com
mife&ioners will have pointed out to them
the old lumber and scrap iron spikes that
have been used in place of first class ma
terial.

There are 9S0 cylinders called for in the
specifications. Contractor Wakefield is
IS CONTBACTOB'S PBOFIT.
One item, that of the expanded metal
work Interior cylinders, can be cited as
an Instance. The specifications called for
twenty feet of the metal work In each
cylinder. Norton admitted yesterday that
he gave orders for only twelve feet of the
metal work to be placed in each cylinder.
As a matter of fact, only eight feet have
been used. This means a saving of twelve
feet of metal work cylinder to each
wooden cylinder. The metal work costs
5 cents per square foot. Ten feet are re
quired to make the diameter of the cylin
der, so that the contractor saves 50 cents
for each foot of metal cylinder that is not
used. . .
The adage, "Time saved is money
saved," applies in the case of Contractor
Wakefield. who is allowed by Chief En
gineer Norton to carry out contract work
in a manner entirely different to the
specifications. When Wakefield bid for
the contract he was well aware of what
he would have to perform. He secured a
5360,000 contract, and by Norton's manipu
lations of the specifications the contractor
is a considerable sum In labor and
material.
In the last few weeks not a single cylin
der has been pumped down to the twenty
two-foot depth, and concrete has been
dumped by the barrow-load Into the
wooden structures when the latter have
been filled with water.
.TIME SAVED IS MONEY.
Norton insisted yesterday that the cyl
inders had been pumped out to the twen
ty-two-foot deptn before the looee con
crete was tilled In. Norton and his assist
ant insjjector have either been grossly
negligent of their duties or the chief en
gineer is incapable of telling If a cylinder
is ftlled with water or is dry.
Norton s experience with concrete work
would not fill a book. He was formerly
employed by the PaciJjc Improvement
Company as a land surveyor, and counts
on Billy Herrin, the wire-pulling attor
ney for the Southern Pacific Railroad, for
assistance in tight places. Norton was a
schoolmate of Dan Burns, so it is easy
to understand why Norton Is chief en
gineer of the Harbor Commissioners and
arrogates to himself the power of a Pooh
Bah and changes specifications at his own
sweet wlil.
Norton admitted yesterday that he hÂ»d
changed this method, and that by using
a few canvas sacks one-quarter filled
with concrete he secured a good founda
tion in the cylinders. The ciiief engineer
defends the use of the 'â¢trimmer," or
fal-out, to dump loose concrete beneath the
vater in the cylinders.
One need not be a civil engineer or a
contractor to understand that it is far
easier and cheaper to till a. cylinder by
the Norton process than to pump the cyl
ir.der dry.
Norton claimed that In his judgment it
was far better to till the cylinders of the
new wharves with concrete in the man
ner exposed by The Call last Sunday ttian
to adhere to the specifications.
The specifications call lor the cylinders
to be pumped out to the depth of twenty
two feet, and for the rest of the water in
the structures to be displaced by burlap
sacks filled with concrete. When this fill
ing reaches up to the twenty-two foot
mark the water is to be pumped out,
leaving the cylinders perfectly dry an4
ready for loose concrete.

For. the past three months Mrs. Emery,
with her two children, a boy and a girl,
aged respectively 2% and 6 years, has oc

only to be ordered to Mendocino City on
some work. Two days later Mrs. Emery

husband had committed suicide, and ask

The twenty-sixth convention of the In

Union convened at Pythian Castle yester
day with a large attendance and President
James Saxton In the chair. The sessions
will continue throughout the week.
The journeymen expressed the belief
that the employers will grant the de
mands as soon as they see their employes
are determined to stand for -them In a
body even to the point of striking. On
the other hand, many of the smaller em
ployers say that the Increase would ruin
them and virtually put them out of busi
ness.
The union members discussed the mas
ter at length after the departure of the
master 'barbers, and a resolution was
adopted amid enthusiasm to stand by the
new schedule. A committee was appoint
ed to wait upon' the employers to-day and
notify them that the . schedule must go
into effect by June 9. Should the em
ployers refuse a general strike will be or
dered. .
Speaking in behalf of the smaller shops.
President Conrad said the demands would
be refused. The master barbers had no
desire to refuse their employes anything
within reason, but they could riot agree
to pay the increase of wages demanded.
WILL BEFUSE DEMANDS.
President H. Conrad of the Master Bar
bers' Union and Messrs. Glassman and
Seppich, representative employers, ad
dressed the journeymen, of whom nearly
BOO were present. They said that the
smaller shops could not afford to . meet
the demands and that they alone would
suffer, as the larger shops are paying
more wages than the new schedule de
jnands.
The average wage of the barbers at the
present time is $12 a week. Some time ago
the' union adopted a new scale of wage's,
which called for $14 a week for journey
men barbers. I This schedule -also demand
ed $9 a week for * men employed in the
evenings and Saturdays and. Sundays;
$7 50 for men employed Wednesdays, Sat
urdays and Sundays, and $6 for men em
ployed on Saturdays and Sundays. This
schedule was presented, to the Master
Barbers' Union, and after some consid
eration the employers decided that they
could not meet the demands. The. result
was some talk of a strike, and in order
that the employers might be given a
chance to express their views a confer
ence was arranged for last night. â¢
Unless the master barbers the de
mand of their journeymen employes for
an increase of wages to $14 a week
a general strike will 'be â¢ * ordered.

< . ROOM FOB DEBATE.
- There is room for debate as to the' con
structlon of the charter provisions for re
moval, . and tiiat being, so the . later claimant
should be compiled to establish their rlgh
by quo Â¦ warranto proceedings. To decide i:
this proceeding that the charter does or tha
it does not permit removals without notice o
hearing would be to determine who of the con
tending- parties constitute the lawful. Board o
Health, the very thing which all parties agre
cannot themselves decide the disputed right
and , execute . that decision by, installing them
selves in office forcibly or by entry in the ab
sence of the officers in * possession. Since the
plaintiffs refuse to yield possession the de
fendants must enforce their right to possession,
if. they, have such right, by legal proceedings.
Of course an . officer who without any show
ing of right attempts to hold on to an office
as against one clearly -entitled -Would not be
granted an injunction . to protect' his. possession
as 1 against the entry of the. rightful claimant.
But here there is a contest which cannot. In
view 'of the authorities, be regarded as without
foundation. Â¦ Â¦ . .

On the foregoing grounds, it 'would appear
that the plaintiffs are entitled â¢. to - the Â¦ in junc

But although a court of equity has no juris

- In my opinion, this rule is Supported not
enly by authority, but by considerations of
reason and public policy as well. If one, hav
ing been appointed or elected . to an office,
finds on demanding the office that 'his prede
cessor refuses to yield, claiming to be still
entitled, what is the proper course for* him.' to
pursue? Is it to seek /to enter -and
dispossess such predecessor surreptitiously,
or by force, or is It to proceed to establish. his
right, by the orderly process of law, , in ..an
action in which such right can be established
promptly and effectively? The / question â¢ ad
mits of but one answer. The proceedings set
forth in Sees. 803 to 810 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (In effect, quo warranto). furnish an
adequate method of determining whether or
not the officer refusing to surrender has any
right to the office.- The claimant out;. of poe
sersion, however srood his -claim- may e\-ent
ually turn out to be, should,, in the interest of.
peace and order, be compelled to resort to
such proceedings. -If his â¢ rights is established
it can at once be enforced, even though -an
appeal be taken, e. C. P. 040.) .-/ '
The title to the office, in the case. at bar,
depends upon a determination of the ques
tion whether, under the charter, the Mayor, has
the power of removing appointed officers with
out giving them an opportunity to be heard In
defense of charges first presented against them.
The plaintiffs contend that he has not such
power; the defendants that he has. But a
determination i of | this , question would be . de
ciding the title to the office, which, as is- con
ceded, cannot be done in an Injunction*, suit,
but only in the form of Â¦ proceeding known as
quo warranto, or its statutory equivalent. -It
follows that- It would be idle for. the court, in
this proceeding; to express an opinion as to
the construction of the charter I provision re
garding the removal of officers. Such an opin
ion would have no binding effect, and would
not conclude either side in .any. proceedings
which might hereafter be brought to determine
who has the better right, or the only right, to
the office In question. . Whether, under the
charter, the Mayor has power to remove ap
pointed officers without giving them notice of
charges and a hearing, and whether the plain
tiffs or the defendants Stinson, Adler, Rot
tanzl and Van Meter are members of the Board
of Health are therefore questions which can
not be and are not decided on this hearing
or in this action. v . - â¢ Â¦Â¦ -<.
TITLE IS INVOI/VED.
At the outset of the argument it was con
tended by the one side and conceded by. the
other that a court* has no jurisdiction, j in. a
suit for .an injunction, to try the title, to pub
lic office. Artd this is undoubtedly the estab
lished law. High on Injunctions (3d ed.),' sec.
1312.
It is alleged that the proceedings to remove
the plaintitis were taken without any previous
notice to them, and without their having. had
an opportunity to be heard, or to defepd. against
any charges made. It appears, further,, that
the plaintiffs deny the right of the Mayor Â¦' to
remove them in the manner which has been
adopted, and intend to contest the defendants'
title to the of nee, based on such removal or
attempted removal.' â¢ ' ' ' ..
will continue in office . for" some
time at least. Judge Sloss decided yes
terday that the injunction granted the
old board restraining Mayor Schmitz's ap
pointees from interfering with it should
bu continued in force until the merits of
the case are determined by, a^court ' ol
equity. Judge Sloss holds thaOhougb a
court of equity may not try the title to
a public office, it may by injunction pro
tect the officer in possession as against
the interference of an adverse claimant,
until the latter has established his title
by appropriate proceedings at. law, viz.,
by the prosecution of a writ of quo war
rento.
It is probable that an appeal will -be
taken from the opinion of Judge Sloss, m
which case several months- must elapse
ere the matter of the injunction is set
tled. In case quo 1 warranto proceedings
are brougnt, there is prospect of another,
appeal, thus making it possible for the old
board to remain in office for at least two
years. Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢. Â¦ â¢
Judge Sloss' decision is as follows:.
On the 25th day of March, 1902^ and for
some time prior thereto, the plaintiffs and the
defendant Ward, were members of the Board
of Health of the city and tounty of San Kran
cisco. On the day named the -defendant
Schmltz. as Mayor of said city and county,
caused to i be served upon the plaintiffs â¢ a
paper statins that he had, pursuant to the
provisions of article* XVI, section 16, . of the
charter, removed them from of nee for various
causes stated in said paper, and that he had
appointed in their place and stead, as mem
bers of said Board of Health, the defendants
Stlnson. Adler. Rottanzl and Van Meter. On
the following day the plaintiffs commenced this
action, and obtained an injunction restraining
the defendants from interfering with said
plaintiffs in the performance of their duties as
members of the Board of Health. The defend
ants have demurred to the complaint, moved
to strike out portions thereof, and have moved
to dissolve the injunction.
THE Board of Health removed, by
Mayor Sehmitz to make room for
