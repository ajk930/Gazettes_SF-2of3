Lord Kitchener, in a dispatch from Pre
toria, dated to-day, announces that the

arms., yesterday. Afterward the Commis^
Eloners addressed the Boers, who gave

KRUGER IS EXEMPTEDr
The Birmingham Post, the organ of Co
lonial Secretary Chamberlain, to-day says
that, ovving to his age and infirmities, the
British Government has waived Its claim,
for the acknowledgment by Mr. Kruger
of British sovereignty over the Trans
vaal and has guaranteed to all the Boer
delegate* in Europe a safe conduct to
their homes In South Africa-
According to a news agency. Colonel
Arthur Lynch, who fought with the Boers
In South Africa, was elected in November
last to represent Galway in the House of
Commons, and who it was announced
last night in a dispatch from Paris had
decided to go to London early next week
and- attempt to take his seat in the House,
will not be allowed to carry out his in
tention. He will be arrested, It is said, on
\he charge of treason Immediately after
landing In England. A sharp watch is
being kept for Colonel Lynch, and if he
reaches Westminster it will be by strata
gem.
. Lord Kitchener replied in behalf of the
army in South Africa, tendering his sin
cere thanks for the congratulations of the
Government, which he was cure the
troops would receive with great satisfac
tion.
The War Office has sent congratulations
to Lord Kitchener on the energy, skill
end patience with which he conducted
the long campaign in South Africa and
has asked him to communicate to the
troops the Government's profound sense
of their spirit of endurance, bravery and
discipline, and also of their humanity,
ehown throughout the trying period.

The Colonial Secretary, Joseph Cham
l-erlain, at the' opening here this after
noon of the temporary club, established
for the use of the colonial troops who are
to attend the coronation, said the empire
owed a great debt to the colonies, v.hich
had furnished the motherland with an
army in South Africa larger than the
British army which fought at Waterloo.

General Botha then demanded independ

3. By reason of the separation, the religious
orders can no longer perform in behalf of
the state the duties. In relation to public In
struction and public charities formerly resting
upon them and the power which they formerly
exercised, through their relations to â¢ the civil
government, being now withdrawn, they find
themselves the objects of such hostility on
the part of their tenantry against them as
landlords and on the part of the . people of
the parishes against them as representatives
OBJECTS OF HOSTILITY.
2. It Is necessary to deal now with the re
sults of establishing a government controlled
by this principle in the . Philippine Islands,
which have for centuries been governed under
an entirely different system, with church and
state closely united and having functions of
the ona exercised by agents of the other;
where the church has long controlled and
acted virtually as the agent of the stale In
the field of public instruction and public chari
ties, and haÂ» from time to time acquired large
properties held by It or by its subordinate
corporations or officers for these public uses.
.A novel situation has been created under which
the adjustment of means to ends appropriate
to the former system entirely falls to produce
the Intended result under the new system, and
the separation of church and state requires to
be followed by a readjustment and rearrange
ment In the interests both of church and of
state, and for the attainment^ of the great
ends of civil government, of education, of
charity and of religion.
1. One of the controlling principles of our
Government Is the complete separation of
church and state, with the entire freedom of
each from any control or Interference by the
other. This principle la Imperative wherever
American Jurisdiction extends, and no modifica
tion or shading thereof can be a subject of dU
cusilon.
Tou are accordingly authorized in the course
or your return Journey to Manila to visit Rome
and there ascertain what church authorities
have the power to negotiate for and determine
upon a sale of the lands of the religious orders
in the Philippine Islands, and if you find, as
we are informed, that the officers of the church
ai Rome have such power and authority, . you
will endeavor to attain the results above Indi
cated. Any negotiations which you may en
ter upon are always subject to granting of
power by Congress to follow the negotiations
by binding action. In any conferences and
negotiations you will bear In mind the (follow
ing propositions which are deemed to be funda
mental and which should be fully and frankly
stated to the other side In the negotiations:
CHURCH AND STATE.
Sir: It is now apparent that Congress will
not have acted upon the Philippine. Commis-
Elon*B recommendations regarding the purchase
of friars' lands before the time of your departure
for Manila, which cannot be longer , delayed.
You cannot, therefore, as we hoped, receive
definite instructions and proceed, to take such
steps in the execution of specific authority from
Congress, as should properly be taken before
you return to Manila. The committees of both
houses have, however, reported favorably upon
thÂ«s commission's recommendations, and It ap
pears probable that Congress will confirm their
action. In view, therefore, of the critical situ
ation of this subject in the Philippines and of
the apparent impossibility of disposing of the
matter there by negotiating with the friars
themselves, the President does not feel at lib
erty to lose the opportunity for effective action
aftorded by your presence in the Weat. He
v.iEhes you to take up the subject tentatively
nith the ecclesiastical superiors, who must ul
timately determine the friars' course of con
duct, and endeavor to reach at least a basis
of negotiation along lines which will ba satis
factory to them and to the Philippine Govern.
ment, accompanied fey a full understanding on
both sides of the case and the views and pur
poses of the parties to the negotiations, so that
when Congress shall have acted the business
may proceed to a conclusion without delay.

Secretary Root sent to the Philippine
committees of the Senate and House text
ual copies of the Instructions given by
him to Governor Taft. These instructions

Taft to the Vatican officials and, as will

TEXT OF INSTRUCTIONS. *
The step which has been taken marks
a new and radical departure in American
diplomacy. There was hesitation for a
long time as to whether it would not be
impolitic to have an official clothed with
all the authority of the President in the
matter consult with the Vatican on a
question of administration either In the
United States or its insular possessions. -
Other Presidents have hesitated to con-"j
suit with any denomination about its
policy, but the situation regarding the
friars' lands was so difficult and possessed
so many unique features that it was
finally decided that Governor Taft should
go to Rome and fully explain the diffi
culties of the case with a view to arriv- ;
Ing at a harmonious understanding.

As to the possibilities of danger from
seismic disturbances, he thought: It was
practically an even thing between the two
routes. There was not enough/ danger
along either: route to deter thÂ©^United
States from building/ thÂ© canal: either j In
Nicaragua or Panama, He laid particular
stress ' on thÂ© . danger . to . the ' Nicaragua
route from volcanoes and he referred to
the ' maps arranged on ' the walls . of the
chamber to' show the active arid", extinct
volcanoes In the regions of the Nicaragua
route. He quoted Professor Hejlprin, the
volcano expert, as saying that the region
of Panama was not' iri danger, from vol

-.Richardson then read that portion of
President Roosevelt's speech in which he
referred to. the epithets applied to Grant
and Lincoln and the resolution passed by
the Confederate Congress denouncing the

casion,, when honor was being done to the
thousands tof s brave, dead who died in de

Richardson recalled the visit of the late
President McKinley to Huntsville, Ala., a
year, ago,' the reception given him by the
Confederate and Union veterans. The

him to the South and he told of the great

Raymond M. Barnes, the dead fireman,
resided at 1641 Harmon street, Berkeley.
He had been in the Southern Pacific em
ploy four years. Barnes was 23 years old,
the son of Mr. and Mrs. Edgar M. Barries.
His father, now in Alaska, is an attorney.
There is also a sister. Miss Beryl Â£.
Barnes.
"I - am Informed that Fireman Barnes
was killed by the coal piling upon himl
He must have been firing when the crash
came. Canfield was hurt by debris after
he jumped for his life. Wlllard stayed
with his engine and was the least hurt."
""We have been trying to make that
point as safe as possible. Fifty feet of
the embankment there had been dug away
and we were preparing to lay a double
track. . ' - _
"From all we know at present," he said,
"the tilame seems to lie with the crew of
the work train. They knew the passenger
train was due at the time they were run
ning into B_enicia. Perhaps they thought
they could 'steal* in and make a siding
before the passenger pulled out. ThÂ© pas
senger has been late two or three times
and they might have thought they werÂ©
safe. It is the duty of all work trainmen
to keep clear of regular passenger trains.

The work train was on the main track,

result the "Wyoming re
gion was a place of almost absolute pedce
to-day. There -were no parades, marches
or any considerable gathering or persona
and the police authorities of the county
had little more to do than keep watch.
The Stanton colliery, where the shooting
occurred, was visited to-day by hundreds
of persons, who expected to see more
trouble, but no more crowds were allowed
to congregate In that neighborhood. ThÂ»
colliery is closed down as tight as a drum
aa a result of the disturbance there. Even
the coal and iron police, with the excep
tion of four or five, gave up their jobs
and left town as quickly aa they could
get out. There were about twenty in the
party, including several colored* cooks.
Last night's demonstration was too much
for them and they decided to leave. /
. PBOTECTED BY STRJHEHS.
The fact in some manner became known
to the strikers and the latter promised to
protect them to ; the railroad station If
they would leave the city. Accordingly
under a strong guard of mine workers
thÂ© ex-policemen left tha colliery and
marched to the offices of thÂ© Lehigh and
"Wilkesbarre Coal Company, where they
received their pay and transportation.
Later the men left for New York and
Philadelphia.
j The preliminary hearing of the four coal
Â¦ and iron policemen who are charged with
1 the shooting of the boy was not held to
day, but they will probably be arraigned
to-morrow. The condition of the boy is
still serious, but it is believed he will
recover.
There were a number of desertions
among the fire bosses employed at several
mines in this vicinity, which caused tha
, companies much inconvenience.
WATER IS ACC U MUXATHTG.
President Mitchell said to-day that tha
strike of thÂ© engineers, firemen and pump
men is practically complete.- ThÂ© mining
superintendents say that as far as they
are concerned there has been no changa
in thÂ© general situation in the past twen
ty-four hours. "Water Is still accumulat
ing in thÂ© lower levels of somÂ© of tha
mines, but the coal company officials
seem to be indifferent regarding the flood
ing of the workings.
Another boy, named John Short, aged 13
years, was seriously wounded herÂ© to-day,
but his Injuries were not received as a
result of tha strike. HÂ© was crossing a
farm at Sugar Notch, near here, owned
by the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Com
pany. Robert Hayden, thÂ© tenant, has
been bothered^by idle men and boys cross
ing his place, so he decided to put a stop
to it. The lad, who works In a coal
breaker, was shot In the back, and his
wound is considered serious. Hayden was
arrested..
"GUARD" COMMITTEES.
All the local unions, at the request of
President Mitchell, to-day appointed
"guard" committees, whose duty it will
bÂ© during the period of strike to prevent
persons from destroying property and
more especially to keep children away
from the collieries.
The strike of the soft coal miners . in
"West Virginia for higher wages, which
is to be begun to-morrow, will be directed
by President Mitchell from Wilkesbarre.
He said that there are 29,000 men in that
field, that 18,000 will stop work to-morrow
and that he expects the others will all be
out in the course of a few days.

A suit to recover possession of tha
twenties would be one of the most inter
esting actions ever filed in this city Not
only would arrests be liable to follow
but with official disclosures the Grand
Jury could hardly escape taking up the
affair.
A few days ago Attorney Rhodes' called
at the police otrice and demanded the $60
for Minor. Pickering refused to give it
up. It is said that a replevin suit will
be commenced. There la no law by
which the City Treasurer can receive
"conscience" money, and Minor evidently
believes he might as well have the coin
as to let it lie in the police station The
police officials declare they will not give
up the money until the ownership of it
Is decided in court.
When it became evident that the crook
edness was to come to light during the
last city campaign Minor sent Attorney
Rhodes to the City Treasurer with in
structions to pay the $60 into the city.
Treasurer McUeoghegan refused to re
ceive the money. Rhodes left the
money lying on the counter and left
the office. McGeoghegan threw the
money to the floor. There the shining
gold lay for a couple of hours; Persons
passing in and out of the Treasurer's of
fice concluded that the city must be
flush If money were so plentiful as to be
thrown about. Finally Police Captain
George Pickering was called In and asked
to take possession of the money, which
he did. Since them the gold has been
lying in the police office.
SAX JOSE, June 6.â There is $60 01

plevin suit that may be fraught with
sensational disclosures. Three shining
twenties were tendered City Treasurer
McGeoghegan during the late city cam
paign by Attorney E. L. Rhodes for E.
B. Minor, an electrician, who. It is al
leged, at the request of some of Macken
zie's followers had allowed his bills to be
raised so that the city could be made to
pay bills incurred by the California
Club. This club Is the headquarters of
the Mackenzie faction. When it moved
into Its new quarters Minor did $90 worth
of wiring for the club, and was told that
he was to get his money from the city
by having bills raised for other work
that he would be given. This is alleged
to have been done by forgeries and ad
ditions to the bills. In this way Minor
got about $50 of his money, and the bal
ance was drawn on other bills and given
to him.

Johnstone, the six-year-old son of Rev.
WV H. Johnstone, was lost in the moun
tains. During the dangerous illness of
Mrs. Johnstone the little boy has been
cared for by Miss Kelsey at Oakhurst.
While they were visiting at William
Montgomery's, near Bear River, the little
boy strayed from his companions and be
came lost in the woods along the river. 5
All of the residents in the Montgomery
neighborhood, reinforced by a large crowd
lrom Colfax that responded to tne ringing
of the tire bell, joined In a search. The
little fellow was tracked up Bear River
some distance, the footprints leading to
within a foot of the edge of the clin! at
the marble quarry, and then turning into
the heavy timber and dense chaparral and
manzanita thickets. All trace was lost
until one print of his shoe was found
along Soutn 1'uLa canal, but the search
â¢was fruitless.
Five hours later the boy turned up at
Thomas Kingston's, on the Grass Valley
road. The little fellow came near the
house, carrying a stick and a couple of
rocks to fight off a dog that was barking
at him. He said he wanted to go to Kel
seys. Miss Maggie Kingston lost no time
In taking him. Word was sent, to Colfax
and the Doy'a recovery was announced by
the ringing of the fire bell, and every
body was happy. The boy must have
traveled, about eight miles over rough

the thickets in many places. He stoutly
aih'rma, however, that the searchers did
not find him.

carry out a plan which they had mapped

sands of acres of his pasture In order to
destroy grasshoppers. He was told the
commissioners had no such right. The

uable services of John Myers at. the bat

Dickenson, who, next to B. G. Sloman,
was the strongest all-round player in the

from the Croll brothers, the Bird broth

NEARLY every other man one en
counters these days has either a
fishing rod or a gun under his arm.
This indicates plainly that the pos
sessor of the sporting paraphernalia is
about to leave for the country in quest
of health and a coating of tan.>
Such sportsmen will not find the
streams depleted, as there has been com
paratively little angling done up to the
present time. The season has been unus
ually backward, owing to. the late rains
leaving the streams high and the trout
undisturbed.
There were storms In the McCloud Riv
er district and on the Truckee and the
Sacramento Decoration day, putting a
damper on the sport of the anglers who
went to those streams. W. D. Mans
field, Ed. Everett and a number of other
Â¦well-known anglers made the pilgrimage
to the McCloud. A snow storm put an
end to their hopes.
W. A. Cooptr, A. S. Carmon and son,
John Slebe and a host of anglers were on
tho upper Sacramento. They also met
with disappointment. .
Charles Precht, Frank Dolliver, Louis
Rondeau and Bert Spring fished the Paper
Mill near Point Reyes last Sunday. Mr.
Dolliver was high hook, with seventy
seven trout. The remainder of the party,
were nearly as successful.
Among the anglers at Boca are Mr.
Kabler and son; J. P. Wallace, Mr. Foun
tain, Jeff Wells, W. C. Peyton, Charles
W. Johnson of San Francisco; H. A. and
E. F. Wilkins of New York. The best
hshing Is said to be from the Big Rock to
Burckhalter, about two miles below Boca.
The Leaf brothers of Boca have been
making good catches.
Joseph Vincent, William Duffy and Her
man Pless are in the Lake Tahoe dis
trict, where they will spend two weeks
in quest of trout.
J. Fatjo caught thirty-six "horse" smelt
off Angel Island some days since. A
number of them weighed a pound and a
half each. Smelt are being taken in large
numbers at the Sausalito whaxf.
George Lane, Dr. F. J. Lane and A. R.
Powers fished the Carmel last Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. They took in all
some 500 fish, chiefly small ones. George
Lane caught a five-pound steelhead on a
spoon. The favorite fly was the brown
hackle and the black gnat.
William Ellis and George Ellis fished
near Point Bonita some days since. The
former caught an eight-pound capazoni,
a member of the cod family. His brother
caught a number of red cod weighing
from three to five pounds.
Mr. Fountain sent down a fine box of
fish from Boca on Wednesday, which In
dicate the angling has Improved there.
It should continue good until the heat
melts the snow and raises the river again.
George Hass, . William Hutton and T.
Rothschild tried for salmon at Monterey
last Sunday. The latter was the successful
one of the party, getting three weighing
respectively twenty-five, sixteen and ten
Â§ounds. The heavy wind on Friday and
aturday drove the sardines out to sea
and spoiled the fishing.
B. Fountain, F. Stores and M. J. Moore
spent a week on the East Austin. They
packed In from Cazadero, eight miles to
Red Slide Mountain. They took in all 343
trout, measuring from six to eight Inches,
using fly and spoon. The rain, put an end
to their sport.
John Deane, J. L. Herget, Al Coney,

P. E. Stowell of the Portland Rowing
Club states the Portland crew will use
its best efforts to win the barge race
at the Fourth of July regatta. The Port
landers are very desirous of having a
shell race, as they consider shell racing
the highest form of .the sport, and are
anxious to impress Californians with
that idea. P. E. Stowell rightly says
that if the University of California and
Stanford once became interested in row
ing the sport would receive a great im
petus. The Portland four are S. M. Lu
ders, R. C. Hart, R. G. Durham and P.
E. Stowell. William Patton will also
come to- California to pull in the single
shell race. The Portlanders will use the
boat ,use of the University of California
on Sessions Basin for training quarters.
There was a large attendance of mem
bers and much enthusiasm at the last

Club. Nearly twenty new members have

July regatta. They have received per
mission of the South End Rowing Club
to use its boathouse.
It was hoped the University of Califor
nia Boating Association might be repre
sented by a shell crew at the annual re
gatta, but Barry H. Cerf, captain, says
it is impossible for him to get together a
four-oared crew. W. B. Goodwin, who
has acted as coach of the university
crews, is too busy and Arthur Smith, one
of the most valuable men in the crew, is
going away from Berkeley on a vacation,
which he tried unsuccessfully to postpone.
No other man is available to take the

The Oakland Canoe Club held its usual
Decoration day reception In Its clubhouse
on Sessions Basin, but the race among
the canoes for the Mayiisch badge and
among the sloops for the Holiday cup had
to be called off on account of the violence
of the wind, which blew, with unusual
force on the, creek. Commodore Caduc's
flagship Ar.nle lay at her moorings in Ses
sions Basin, and the guests of the club
â¢were- hospitably received in her cabin

There was a dance in the evening.
The sloop Mcrope has been chartered
for the season to L. A. Weidenmuller W
W. Coates and Will Morton. She will con
tinue to fly the Corinthian burgee.
The San Francisco clubmen now say
their only anxiety about the Challenger
was lest she should carry away some
part of her gear before finishing the race.
'J'hat she could outfoot anything of ner
class on the bay they felt quite satisfied,
hut they did not feel sure she would
cover the course without mishap. During
her practice spins her speed was not sus- '
pected, as several Corinthian yachts, the !
Edna., Aeolus and Presto, beat her in !
brushes in the channel. But she had a I
great quantity of barnacles and seaweed i
on her bottom, which, while holding her
back greatly, did not interfere with the
practice of her skipper and crew. She
might have beaten Harpoon by an
even larger margin that she did, as she
lost 2S seconds in crossing the starting
line, was slow in setting her spinnaker,
and on the last run home did not set her
water-sail at all. Her skipper did some
pretty work in rounding the leeward
stakeboat, establishing an overlap on Har
poon and compelling her to let the Chal
lenger pass between her and the mark
This required considerable nerve and a
perfectly steady hand on the tiller, as not
more than a foot separated the two boats
After the race the Challenger was done
and could not have gone around the
course again. Her sails were dropped and
she was towed over most of the way to
Sausalito until temporary repairs were
made. That Ehe covered the course with
out mishap was a matter of general satis
faction as neither the yachtsmen nor the
general public would have liked to see
the race won by the defender through an
accident to the Challenger. The new boat
will I certainly win the Macdonough cup
in the 30-foot class at the interclub re
gatta in September.
The defense of the Perpetual cup has
been a matter of serious expense to the
Corinthians, who fitted up Frank Stone's
Presto and spent a considerable Bum on
Harpoon. Whether the Corinthians
will make an attempt to get back the
trophy next year or not is uncertain; they

The Vallejo Yacht c'lub may challenge
next year with >L E. Chapman's speedy
sloop Helen. The Corinthians might
challenge with a Email sloop like Dis
covery, in which case the Challenger
could not be used as a defender as her
racing length exceeds that of Discov
ery by more than 10 per cent. The yacht
clubs of San Francisco Bay are not rich
enough to build a boat every year or
even every other year, simply to try for
the Perpetual Challenge cup, and It is,
that even such fast cruisers a?
Presto, Aeolus and Harpoon stand little
chance with a. boat of the most modern
type, which foots fast, goes about Ina
few seconds and reaches wonderfully
There was a lively time at the San
Francisco Yacht Club house at.Sausa
nto last Saturday night. Rockets and
other fireworks were procured and there
v.-as a general Jollification. Later a re
ception will be held, at which the Chal
lenge cup will be formally turned ov*>r
to the winners.
Fred Russ Cook, on the other hand,
pursued the usual course in a flood-tide
race when he went over to the Presidio
snore and made short tacks out to the
windward buoy. Had the Challenger
adopted this course she would have
gained considerably on Harpoon, as
ner quickness in stays gave her an advan
tage of about 4 seconds every time she
tame about.
Yachtsmen are still discussing the Har
poon-Challenger contest. They are unani
mous in the opinion that W. G. Morrow
sailed an excellent race, although he de
parted from a well-established rule of
yacht racing when he eplit tacks off Alca
traz Island. On the first beat out the
challenger had satisfactorily shown she
cuuld outfoot Harpoon and was point
ing as high as the defender. Being enti-
Ut-<i to an allowance of 3 minutes 43 sec

winning the race was to hang on to Har
poon. \V r . G. Morrow, however, knew that
at certain conditions of the flood tide and
m a certain place an ebb eddy runs out
from Alcatraz Island, and his purpose
was to find this and keep in it as long as
Ijossible. That he found it is clear from
the fact that the great gain of the
challenger was made between Alcatraz
and the windward mark.

Frank Moran, who was the second
president of the California Coursing Com
mittee and the owner of False Flatterer,
Golden Russet and other good perform
ers, has been heard from In Sydney. In a
letter to Secretary Malcolm he says he
recently witnessed his first coursing since
February, 1900. He says there is a lot of
interest shown in coursing in and about
Sydney, but that the greyhounds are not
always sent to the slips in as good condi
tion as they should be. The coursing Is
chiefly in the open, but there ara some
inclosed meetings.
Second payment of $2 50 in the Califor
nia Futurity stake will be due on July 1.
A puppy stake will be run at Union
Park on the 14th inst.. while a sapling
stake will be on the card a week later.

here.
The third meeting of the season of
the Butte City (Montana) Coursing Club
last Sunday was postponed on account
of rain. One round of a 33-dog stake was
run.
AN unusual amount of illness In the
various kennels about this city has
for the time being reduced the num
ber of greyhounds available for
coursing. For some years past about this
time an epidemic has swept through the
kennels. It has not been fatal, and In
former years disappeared almost as sud
denly as it appeared. It has reduced the
numbeY but not the quality of the run
ning dogs- At Union Park a consolation
stake will fill the programme to-morrow
to its usual size.
It has practically been settled that
the Ladies' Day champion stake will not
be run until the first Sunday in July.
This rich stake will then be the feature
of a three days' meeting, extending over
the Independence day holiday. This will
be almost a rerunning of the California
Coursing Committee stake, all the crack
dogs beins entered.
H. F. Anderson starts a young grey
hound to-day which gives promise of

Highlands, and is by Crawford Lad-Car

ning. S*i* ' H
The Pastime Coursing Club of St. Loui3

remonstrated with Mr. and Mrs. James
Fishbourne, who occupy the upper part
of the same flat with her, yesterday for,
she claims, hiding her clothes In the
woodshed. The husband continued the
remonstrance when he came home and
says he was felled by a blow from Fish
bourne on the face. To save her old hus
band from a beating she says she struck
the man on the head with a broomstick.
For her pains she received two blows on
the face, the marks of which she still car
ries. These attacks were j followed up
with an accusation of insanity against
the old woman.
Mrs. Fisher is 77 years~of age and lives
at the expense of the county and her
neighbors at 137 Ettie street, in the Watts
Tract, North Oakland. Her husband,
three years' her senior, does what his fee

Francks of Oakland Is Injured and
Retires From the Game.
LOS ANGELES. June 6.â It was the
same old result at Washington Park to
day, with a change only in the details of
attaining it. What the locals did "not do
with Schmidt's pitching would make a
long story, while that which they
achieved is shown at the foot of the ba.;e
hit column. Even. these six Â¦ hits were
scattered along through the row of ci
phers like milestones. Jones was hit
often enough to win most games, even
with better support than that given him
to-day. Francks, the crack shortstop in
the Lohman aggregation, tried to stop a
screeching liner from Toman's bat in the
first inning and as a consequence nis right
hand is disabled. He leaped Into the air,
barely reaching the ball with the tips of
his fingers. The ball got away and
Francks suffered a" broken or strained lig
ament of the middle finger that will keep
him on the bench for several days. Dev
ereaux went to short, Dunleavy to third
and Cristall to the right field. It made
no difference, however, as the visitors
played with a vim and snap that are seen
only when Oakland comes to town. Pete
Lohman could not miss the hardest kind
of foul flies. Roach also distinguished^
himself by taking one against the. grand
stand, as well as making a two-base hit.
Toman batted and fielded well, his two
errors being inexpensive. Bill Devereaux
played the game at all stages. He got his
base on balls twice, lined' out a three
tagger, which Slagle should have stopped,
and scored three of Oakland's seven runs.

S. Buckmaster, back.
The English team is undoubtedly
stronger individually than it was In the
former game.
THE Ponies are taking straight tips'
from the champs. They put it on
the forlorn ,bail-tosscrs from the
capital city yesterday for the third
stright time this week. The Senators put
up a good quality of ball for a losing,
bunch, but still it was not quite good
enough to win. The hitting was about
even 'up, but Hulen's bad error arid
Eagan's bad judgment on two occasions
gave Harris' men the game. )
It was another pitchers' battle, with
Glendon and Dowling the chief fighters.
Both twirled in admirable style. The con
test was generallv fast and snappy, in
places, but the genuine enthusiasm and
vim were lacking at all stages. The crowd
felt for Fisher's unfortunates and yelled
for them, but it takes more than shouts
to win ball games, and the Senators were
not there with the genuine article.
A pair of two-cushion swings by Mere
dith and Nordyke made the first Pony
tally. The Senators tied up the result In
the sixth on Lawler's double. Holly's er
ror and Unglaub's-out to second and first
on a hard hit ball, which bounded away
from Reilly into Shugart's mitts.
The Ponies galloped twice more to the
wire before the bell sounded time. Leahy
did the turn each time, once on a pass,
an infield out and a single by Delmas,
and again on a double and Hulen's fum
ble of Delmas' drive in back of second.
Truck Eagan spoiled Sacramento's
chance for a run in the fourth. He ran
from second on Unglaub's pretty single
to right, but got mixed up in some man
ner and neglected to place his ponderous
foot firmly on the home plate and was
called out. In the sixth he failed to field
Delmas' hit past first base, and Leahy
scored with two out.
Lawler picked up a job in lightning
like order. He was released by Harris on
Thursday and was put in the center gar
den by the Senators yesterdav. He did
fine work at the bat, scoring the only run
and hitting out a double and a single out
of three trips to the plate. Shugart
graced the second pillow and played a
gilt-edged game.
Second Baseman McNichols has jumped
his contract and is believed to be on his
way to Salt Lake City, where he played
before he came to this city. Yesteray
was payday for the locals, and McNichois
knew he was soon due for his release, 30
he got into an independent mood and did
the hot foot before Uncle Hank had the
satisfaction of telling him he was a dead
one. The score:

CONGRESSMAN GOLDFOGLE is making
Â¦ strenuous efforts to force an issue with Rus
sia upon the manner in which American Jews
are treated by that Government. He has not only
raised the question in -Congress, but is taking an ac
tive part in an agitation on the subject now going on
in the Eastern States. He has already accomplished
a good deal, for hei has compelled the public to give'
attention to the wrong, and in that way has gone
far toward arousing a public sentiment that will in
turn compel the Government to act.
It appears that Goldfogle and his assistants in the
agitation have special grievances to complain of.- A
distinguished American has been denied admissioii to
Russia because he is i< Jew, and an American Jewess
has .been excluded notwithstanding the 'fact that she
desired 'to visit the country solely to see her father,
who was then lying on his deathbed. It is not as
serted by the Russian Government that either of' the
two applicants is an anarchist, a criminal or other
wise personally objectionable.' They are deprived of
.the privilege of Visiting Russia or traveling through
Russia solely because they are Jews.
The issue raises a question as to whether the Rus
sian Government can make a distinction .'among
American citizens by reason of race or a-eed. If a
foreign Government by treaty, agrees to confer cer
tain privileges upon "American citizens," can that
Government thereafter deny them to any American
by reason of his religion or his descent without vio
lating the treaty? That is the issue Congressman
Goldfogle is pressing upon the country. I
In a treaty between the United States and Russia
made in 1832 it is declared: "There shall be between
the territories of the high contracting parties a re
ciprocal liberty of commerce and navigation. The
inhabitants of their respective states, shall mutually
have liberty to enter the ports, places and rivers of
the territories of each party wherever foreign com
merce is permitted. .They shall be at liberty to so
journ and reside in all. parts whatsoever'ai* said terri
tories, in order to attend to their, affairs."
We on our part have faithfully kept the treaty. We
have denied no Russian access to the country unless
known to be a criminal, a pauper or the sufferer from
some infectious or contagious .disease. , All Russian
citizens or subjects, irrespective of race or creed, are
permitted to enter our ports. By what right,, then,
does Russia exclude a certain class of American citi
zens? ' .' ; --"C??\' Â¦ " ' 'Â¦'.
It is.gratifying to find that a considerable and in
fluential support has been given to Mr. r - Goldfogle in
his fight. We^have no right nor do: we desire to
force upon Russia any class of persons against whom
MARRIAGE-A. C. K., Haywards, Cal.
If you went out to sea and married a di
vorced man who obtained his divorce in
this State, before a year had elapsed,
there is some doubt about your legal
standing as a wife. If you desire to set
yourself right you will have to secure the
services of a lawyer to have the so-called
marriage declared null and void.
QUR Eastern friends have not yet become ab- :
solute vegetarians, but it looks as if they 1
were being driven in that direction by forces
sufficiently powerful to land them there before long.-
These forces are various ; and not all of : them are.
operating in the same locality, but they mutually|
strengthen one another and-make a mighty turmoil
for meat-eaters. .
â¢Â¦'In the first place there is the beef trust,' whose
operations' have disturbed a good many people. Next'
is the rise in the price of beef, which/whether caused
by the trust or not, has forced a considerable num
bfc'r of people to." prefer to dine without; eating flesh.
Then in Chicago there is a strike' amohg the team
sters who have been doing the hauling-' for the stock
yards and the packers, and there is danger that no
mpat will be hauled for the. hungry eve~n if they have
tlie price and are willing to paj' it., ]'
v Ttlis in the tenement districts of the larger cities On
â¢the Atlantic seaboard that the trouble is most per
plexing. 'Â¦ A. powerful element of the tenement" popu
lation has declared war against the "meat trust," as'i
it is calle'd, and has undertaken to suppress the sale
of fresh meat by the butchers.
; Eastern papers afe full of accounts of riots along
tlie-whole line from. Massachusetts to New Jersey.
Recently in' the Williamsburg district of New York
806 men and women marched through the streets for
the purpose of attacking the shops/of butchers who
lefused to stop selling meat. Similar riots have oc
curred in Boston, Brooklyn 1 and Newark. The lead
ers of the ; riots are ' Hebrews, . but? men and woni<en

Some of the effects of the lack of meat are unex
pected. A prisoner before a Newark â¢ police court
on a charge of beating his wife sought' to justify.the
offense 'by saying he was rendered savage \ by , want
of'a good steak or. a juicy chop. 7; The wife seems to
have agreed with the husband, for she is reported to
haVe told the court that all went well until it became
impossible for them to.have'meat on.the table regu
iaj-ly, and they had to become vegetarians. â¢ This
didn't; suit her husband, and she affirmed that he be
gan to complain of other things around the house of
which he had not before found fault, and that, finally,
last; week, he beat her. She said she was injured so
badly she had to take to her bed.
How' many other domestic troubles as well as riots
have been caused by the : unaccustomed eating of

x->ENSUS BULLETIN No. 166, dealing with
I American ship-building, shows that the
growth of the industry during the past ten
years exceeds that of any preceding decade. The
growth, however, has been wholly in the construc
tion of vessels for domestic trade. Comparatively
few ships for use in foreign commerce are now con
structed in our shipyards, and the* fact is one that
commands the attention of the country.
The bulletin says: '"In 1826 American vessels car
ried 92.5 per cent of the foreign commerce of the
United States, the value of . which was $150,331,636,
while in 1900 they carried 9.3, the value of which was
$195,083,155, an increase in value of only 29.5 per
cent in seventy-four years. In 1826 foreign vessels
carried 7.5 per cent of our foreign commerce, valued
at $12,238,163, while in 1900 they carried 90.7 per cent,
valued at $1,894,445,461, an increase of 15,379.8 per
cent during the seventy-four years." " â¢
Alexander R. Smith, expert special agent of the
Census Bureau, estimates that fully 5,000,000 tons of
shipping are now required for the carriage of our
entire foreign commerce. He says: "Toward sup
plying that need home shipyards, as we have seen,
contributed only 29,069 tons during the census year of
1900, and only 206,771 tons during the entire ten
.years ending with 1900. At the rate of construction
in 1900 172 years would elapse before enough ton
nage would be built for the present needs of our for
eign trade. The average life of a ship is commonly
computed at ten years, taking into account los>es, ac
cidents and deterioration. But allowing twenty
years as the average life of a modern steel steamship,
at the present rate of construction for foreign trade,
over eight years would elapse before enough ships
would be constructed to provide for the average
losses of one j'ear."
We have here a showing of an industry expanding
rapidly in the construction of vessels for the home
trade and almost stagnant with respect to the con
struction oi vessels for the foreign trade,'notwith
standing the large need of ships for that trade and
the facts that we have cheaper iron and coal and bet
ter machinery and labor than our rivals.
In explanation of the paradox the bulletin says ihe
very infrequency and uncertainty of orders upon
American shipyards lor the construction of ships for
the ocean going trade "largely account for the fact
that the cost of construction per ton is higher in
the United States than in other countries, notablv
Great Britain, which probably builds four-fifths of the
world's ocean-going tonnage, although less than
three-fifths of it is under the flag of that nation.
This anomalous condition of American shipyards, in
respect of equipment for and output of ocean-going
shipping, has attracted widespread attention and pro
voked world- .vide comment. Precisely what should
be done to increase United States shipping in foreign
trade is the much discussed and still unsolved Ameri
can maritime problem."
Mr. Smith is right in referring to the matter as
"an unsolved American maritime problem," and yet
it is strange that it should be so. It is a serious re
flection upon Congress that the solution has not
been provided long ago. At the present time a mer
chant marine bill awaits the action of the House,
which, if enacted, would promptly set our shipyards
to work in the construction of a merchant fleet that
would free us from the burden of paying tribute to
foreigners upon pur ocean commerce and put an end
to the paradox.

WHILE the great nations are busily engaged

Come from Europe of two inventions which ' are

The first is described in the report, of United States
Consul Ozmun at Stuttgart,". who$in noting. the im
provements made in the Krupp . gun industry,' says:
"The latest is tile discovery by a (jiefman chemist by
the name of Giebler of a : process1ofi hardening steel
which makes it, so it is said, 14 per. cent stronger, 50
per cent lighter and one-third . less costly ithan the
Krupp, Harvey; or Boehler steeh'% |le goes on. to
say: '"The inventor will not ; self the. secret of the
process to any foreign manufacturer,* -"but will "retain

this country an enormous advanfage m^navaj matters,
for with lighter hull, lighter\ machineiy" ank lighter
guns a very much higher rate' of speed canl be pro
duced for a given consumption. of fuel7i which means
an enlarged steaming distance.'!^ t; "X'4 .â¢'/'' V
The second invention was briefly described in the;
dispatches a few days ago giving an account *bf tests
made with a new gun invented â¢ by Professor ,K.
Birkeland, a Norwegian scientist. It was stated at
the time that the tests were so successful that a firm'
of artillery manufacturers had offered to buy the in
vention for immediate exploitation. The. first an
nouncement of the invention came to this country in
a report from the, United States Consul . at Chris
tiania, but no further information than the
statement: "Professor Birkeland (who two years
ago was sent by the Government to Northern Nor- r
way to study magnetism, the aurora borealis and
cfoud formations) is engaged in the construction of a
cannon with electro-magnetism as the motive power
in place of explosives. A small model of the,.inven
tion throws projectiles weighing a pound with great
force:" ' r.'-â/ -" . . ;. v .
A later report, pf the invention says: , "Theoreti
cally, Professor Birkelahd's gun can throw a. pro
jectile weighing twb tons a. .distance of ninety. miles,
or even farther, by sufficiently prolonging the. tube.
The principle', upon which the gun acts has not been
made public, but : it is -known that the projectile is
expelled from an. ordinary cast-iron tube thickly
wrapped with copper wire." This tube, can of course
be made more cheaply .than the cannon now in use.
No explosive gases result from the discharge of the
new gun. Professor 'Birkeland's invention has : cre
ated intense interest among technical observers,
some of whom are of the opinion that the new gun
signifies a greater revolution * in fighting material
than that brought about by the discovery of gun
powder."
The two inventions counterbalance one another..
The one increases the protective strength of steel "Vr
mor, while the other augments the force' of the
projectiles which. the armor will have to resist. It ap
pears then that new arms and new armorare about to
be forced upon the nations. The report that the irn
proyed method of constructing armor is to be keptia
secret by Germany may not disturb anybody. Each
of the great nations has had some valuable secret of
the kind which it has tried to. preserve for itself, but
in every instance a really valuable improvement itj
the arms of one country has been soon acquired by
others. If the Giebler steel be so light, tough and
cheap as is reported, it will not be long before the
American steel trust will be making just as good a
quality of it as is manufactured by Krupp. , j,
TWO NEW INVENTIONS.
THE. rebellion in China is becoming formidable
and excites uneasiness in the legations at Pe
king. It is difficult to deal with the Chinese
question patiently, when it is approached from the
standpoint of natural justice. Beginning with the
forgery interpolated into the French treaty of i860,
every step in the history of that unfortunate coun
try is marked with injustice, for' which the western
nations are responsible.
The French. missionary who forged the clause of
the treat}' which permitted missionaries of his coun
try to penetrate the middle kingdom and buy or
lease lots for missionary, purposes was perhaps the
most awful criminal the world has produced, for' his
act has caused more suffering, murder, bloodshed and
injustice than can be traced to one' person in any
other transaction. The United; States, Russia, Eng
land and Germany immediately became partners in
his crime, and it is amazing that Christian mission-,
aries from this country have penetrated China and
claimed rights under that forgery, knowing it to be
a forgery. That crime caused the Boxer outbreak,
and the destruction of mission property, built by no
other authority than forgery. The lives of mission
aries were taken, solely because they were claiming
rights that did not' belong to them, but were depen
dent on forgery only.
Then the nations to which those missionaries be
longed fell upon China and there followed the most
awful and inhuman scenes. Murder, robbery, arson
and crimes unspeakable were committed by the
Christian armies, present in China to enforce the
rights of Christian missionaries, based upon a for
gery by one of their number. The theft and destruc
tion of property by the Christian armies ran into
the hundreds of millions, and, at the end of the- riot
of murder and theft, the same Christian nations com
pelled China to pay the most enormous ransom ever
exacted from a helpless victim by a set of unscrupu
lous robbers. : .
The wealth of China had been stolen or destroyed
by these nations. All North China had been laid
waste. The fields were ruined, crops destroyed,
towns burned and industries suspended. Yet the
authors of all this misery and destruction compelled
the Chinese Government to pay a ransom which
made it necessary for that -Government to imme
diately begin squeezing taxes from her famine
stricken people. As a result mothers have sold their
children and children have starved to death in order
that the Christian nations might get their pound of
flesh out of China. That Government has no choice.
It must pay for being robbed or submit to another
invasion, -and to more murder and famine. But the
people, finding the burden : intolerable, have risen
again and are fighting in revolt against the cruel
taxation put upon them by Christendom as a punish
ment for resenting a forgery.
The fate of the missionary forger is unknown, but
any suffering tha-t may have come to him would not
expiate the misery he has caused.
The fact of his crime is known to every nation
concerned. They all know that it caused the Boxer
revolution. They all know that in its essence that
revolution was just what would have happened in any
nation of Christendom under the same provocation,
and yet not one of them has offered to purge the
French treaty of the forgery and agree to forsake all
rights that have been founded on that crime. Our
own Government has made the most creditable rec
ord of any. We are' not in a consistent position be
cause we. permit our missionaries to enter China pro
tected by what we know to be a forgery, while we ex
clude Chinese and fail to protect against outrage
those who are here by authority of a treaty openly
made. Otherwise our Government has the excellent
record of relinquishing part of the indemnity awarded
to us, and our troops have the credit of abstaining
from the grosser outrages which marked the march
of the Christian armies. The new trouble in China,
having for its cause the- oppression of a people to pay
the unjust exactions of Christendom, should make
every Christian blush for shame and hasten to dis
avow his share of the responsibility.

The casket was then taken to the Wal
ter mausoleum, where prayers were said.
The steps of the vault were strewn with
floral pieces and presented an imposing
spectacle. The remains will lie there un
til the Sloss mausoleum has been erected.
As he shall rest in his grave we shall re
turn to our homes with our hearts filled with
the noble sentiments his career has inspired
within us. God hag given. God has taken
away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
It is good to know that every page of this
man's life was clean and unspotted, and the
only lines that need to be added thereto are
those which show that his life was gentle,
that all must say he was a man. There are
few men who dare to carry their convictions
beyond the ordinary lines of mere duty, but
reaching out was the principle of this man.
In business, in his. relations with men, society,
religion, philanthropy, wife and children, ho
believed In reaching out, and it was this which
made his life truly great. That was the text
of his life from the beginning to the end,
from the days of adversity to those of af
fluence. Honor, love and duty blended with all
the vlrtu.es, rendered him a noble character.
Ungrateful we would be to the Dloneers of
California did we not eulogize the integrity
of this man.
HIS LITE "WAS CLEAN.
The end of life is death. This is a thought
that impresses itself at some time or other upon
every thoughtful man. No man needed praise
so little as him who lies here cold in death,
and no man deserved it more. Some years
ago In discussing the issues of life and death
with Mr. Eloss he said to me that a man's
life must be its own eulogy, his deeds his
monument. He wanted no eulogy spoken at
his bier. But it is meet that we should speak
of the deserving dead. "We have often stood In
admiration before the works of the masters and
in admiring their pencilings we have wondered
how nature could be so marvelously repro
duced. So have the lives of some men been
the counterpart of our conception of a god.
There have been some men whose lives seemed
to have been touched by the hand of God. I
believe this man lived God, acted God, died God.
and that he will be remembered by all who
knew him as a superior man. We need tho
inspiration of such lives to spur us on to bet
ter thlncs. -
The cortege proceeded to the depot at
â¢Third and Townsend streets, and at 3:50
o'clock the special train of six coaches
and funeral car departed for the ceme
tery. Several hundred people witnessed
the departure of the train, and as many
as could be accommodated, nearly all
friends of the deceased, accompanied the
remains to the peaceful spot in San Ma
teo County which has aptly been termed
Home of Peace. Many persons had pre
ceded the cortege and these thronged the
1 avenues of the cemetery long in advance
of the arrival of the funeral party. The
casket was borne to the, chapel, and in
the presence of those who had known and
loved the deceased Rev. Dr. Voorsanger
delivered a short prayer, followed by an
address, in which he spoke of the life
and works of the man whose death is sin
cerely mourned by an entire community.
Rev. Mr. Voorsanger spoke in part as
follows:

Rafael, where the remains lay in state.
Rev. Dr. Jacob Voorsanger was among
those who comforted the widow in the
hour of her bereavement. A few min
utes before noon* the casket, hidden from
right by a shroud of violets, was borne
to the depot, where President Foster's
private car awaited the convenience of
the family. The remains were brought
to this city on board the steamer Ukiah,
a.nd awaiting the funeral party at the
lorry were tne honorary pallbearers and
friends of the family. The pallbearers
were as follows:
All that was mortal of the late Louis

The Most Satisfactory and Safest Med-
icine any Sick Woman Can Take.
Thus Does a Prominent Brooklyn, N.T., Woman, Speak
of Lydia E, Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
"When a woman of the prominence and social standing of Mrs. Atherton
whose portrait we are herewith permitted to reproduce, voluntarily furnishes
us with a letter of such unqualified endorsement as .the following, we feel
that we not only owe her a debt of gratitude, but all women who are ill
should feel under deep obligations to her, for she tells them in unmistakabla
words where they may look for a cure and not be disappointed. .
Such testimony should be accepted by all women as convincing evidence
that Lydia E. Pinkhara's Vegetable Compound stands without a peer
as a remedy for all the distressing ills of women ; all ovarian troubles ; in-
flammations ; ulceration, f ailing and displacements of the womb ; backache ;
irregular, suppressed or painful menstruation. Surely the volume and char*
acter of the testimonial letters we are daily printing in the newspapers can
leave no room for doubt. Truly is it said that it is Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound that is curing so many women, and no other medicine.
MRS. FLORENCE JsTHERTON,
Vice-President Societe Francaise de Bienfaisance, Brooklyn, N. T.
fc DEAÂ» Mrs. Pinkham: â For the benefit of suffering women I want
to testify to the fact that I have by personal experience and by friends
who have been cured by using Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound come to the conclusion that it is the safest, the grandest and the
most satisfactory medicine any sick woman can take. life was a bur-
den to me five years ago, I felt so miserable with female troubles and
irregular menstruation ; to-dav it is all different, for I am perfectly welL
Dozens of my lady friends join me in. singing your praise. Yours,

" A Boston Woman's Experience."
"Dear Mrs. PnntHAu : â I cannot praise Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, enough. I was a sick woman -when I commenced to take
it. My trouble was female disease, and I had pain in my back and sides. The
doctor said I was going into consumption ; I had been married eight years, but
had no children. I had some of the best doctors in the city, but none seemed
to cure me, so' I decided . to take your medicine, and it has made me a new
woman, and I now have a lovely little baby boy. I would advise all sick and
weak women to take Lydia il. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound," â ,
Mrs. Alphoxse Cboke, 13 Bockingham Place, Bozbury District, Boston, Mass. '
Remember every woman is cordially invited to write to Mrs.

The class which graduated yesterday

very pleasing to the audience.

The committee placed on file the peti
tions of M. S. Galvln and others "to set ;
aside a certain sum to provide for a re
count of the vote on the adoption of the
charter and also to pay the expenses
necessary to obtain signatures to a peti
tion providing for the repeal of the char
ter.
"We are very ,sorry," said Chairman
Brandensteln of the committee, "but the
charter gives us no power to grant the
relief, much as we would like to do so.
The only thing to do is to submit an
amendment to the* charter to permit of an
appropriation, or live in the hope that an
other Governor may think more kindly of
the old firemen and sign another bill that
may be adopted."
"These men are entitled to your consid
eration, for they helped to upbuild this
city by risking their lives in preventing
destruction of property by fire. Further
more we would not be here asking your
aid were it not for the fact that Governor
Gage pocketed a bill passed by the last
Legislature appropriating $5000 for their
relief. The Governor's action prevented
the bill becoming a law."
It was demonstrated at the meeting 1 of
the Supervisors' Finance Committee last
night that Governor Gage was no friend
to the members of the old volunteer fire
department, though he once had an op
portunity to show his friendship. J. J.
Guilf oyle, secretary of the Exempt Fire
Department, In making an earnest appeal
to the committee that a sum of money
be set aside by the Supervisors to relieve
the immediate necessities of the infirm
and indigent firemen, said:

Commencement at St. Charles'.
commencement exercises of St.
Charles Academy were held yesterday
afternoon in the school hall at Eighteenth
and Shotwell streets. The exercises were
private, only the clergy and the immedi
ate relatives of the graduates having been
Invited. An excellent programme was
rendered. The following pupils gradu
ated from the grammar school: Miss
Cecelia Sheehan. Miss Florence Hope,
Miss Mary Gargan, Miss Nellie Gargan,
Miss Genevieve Dowdall, Ivo Flynn,
/^ mes * Â°'l& ea> Fra "k O'Shea, Maurice
Â° * e Z te> WMiam Dawson, Roger O'Hara
and Cornelius Thornton. The programme
follows: .
Captain Martin detailed Detectives
Dinan and Wren on the case, and they
were not long in deciding that the sus
picion against White was borne out by
facts. They ascertained that White had
an accomplice, who sent in numerous or
qers for cheap wine, and White would
substitute the most expensive whisky,
brandy or wine, the cheaper grade being
charged to the accomplice. For instance,
a barrel of claret costing about 27Vi cents
per gallon would be ordered, and White
would substitute whisky or brandy coat
ing from 13 to $4 per gallon, the claret be
ing charged. â¢
After satisfying themselves on â¢ this
point the detectives, armed with a search
warrant, went to White's rooming-house,
on Turk street, Thursday night and found
about $800 worth of the best brands of
whisky, brandy, champagne and other
ijquors in his rooms. It required two
wagons to convey the stuff to the prop
erty clerk's storerooms.
White was placed under arrest and
locked up in "the tanks." He admitted -to
the detectives that he had been working
his scheme for the last month with the
aid of an accomplice, but he declined to
give his name. The detectives continued
their work on- the case and have succeed
ed in discovering where the remainder of
the stolen liquor has been stored. They
expect to have White's accomplice in cus
tody at any moment. At least two
charges of grand larceny will be booked
against White.
Olson & Co., grocers, 715 Market street,
notified the police that a thief was op
erating in their liquor department, and
they estimated that about $2000 worth had
been stolen during the last three or four
weeks. Suspicion .pointed to William
White, who for the last five months had
charge of the department.
At the end of an hour's session they
came to the conclusion that as Judge
Cook is vested with the power to assign
the case to any one of them it should be
left to him. Kone of the Judges is anx
ious to handle the case, but they all stat
ed that they will abide by Cook's decision.
Judge Cook made inquiry to ascertain
what Judges would be in the city on
June 30, the date fixed for the argument
in the case, and learned that Judges
Murasky and Troutt would be here. He
will issue an order this morning that
these two Judges sit in bank with him on
the case, which will obviate the necessity
of asking any outside Judges to sit in the
case.
Before what Superior Judge the suit in
quo warranto brought "against the Board
of Health removed from office by Mayor
Schmitz shall be tried is the question that
is bothering the, twelve gentlemen wear
ing the ermine in this city and county.
Presiding Judge Cook has the power to
assign the case to any of his fellow
Judges, but has not yet done so. He
called a meeting of the Judges Thursday
and they met in Judge Hebbard's cham
bers at the City Hail yesterday and dis
cussed the question at length.
That the apportionment of delegates to each
/.Bsembly district, or where more than one
county Is embraced in an Assembly district,
then to each of eaid counties, is as follows:
First Assembly District â Del Norte 1 deie
rnte; fciskiyou, 8; Trinity, 2.

PAINE'S CEIggY OOMPOUinX
THERE IS HOPE FOR EVEN
SUCH AS HAVE GLIMPSES
OF THE DARK VALLEY.
Paine's Celery
Compound
The Medicine That Saves Life and
Restores lost Healtii.
A merciful Providence still keeps the
spark of life in thousands of wasted and
feeble bodies. The fitful, flickering spark
will burn -with decreased power as the
hot days of summer approach. There la
still hope for even those who are now
catching gllmpse3 of the dark valley.
The use of Paine's Celery Compound
during the month of June will at once
arrest the progress of wasting diseases.
It will strengthen the weak and inflamed
nerves, rid the body of morbid waste

SUICIDE'S BODY
CASTRIES, St. Lucia, June 6.â At 2
â¢o'clock this afternoon the darkness was
intense over St. Lucia. A. submarine ex
plosion to-day caused the sea here to re
cede to Its normal level.- No damage was
done. The Souffrlere volcano at St. Vin
cent is quiet.
The explosion this morning was expect
ed and watched for. There was conse
quently very slight panic among the peo
ple here and quiet was soon restored. A
large number of French families are'leav
ing the island. Â¦
No reports of damage have been re
ceived. It is probable .that the area of
activity and destruction is the same as
that of previous outbursts. This area is
now completely abandoned.
The most notable phenomenon to-day
was that the sea rose nearly three feet,
then fell back to below its normal level
and then returned to its normal level.
The eruption was not accompanied by
earthquakes. The sky is now clear, but a
heavy surf is beating on the coast.
FORT DE FRANCE, Martinique, June
6. (6 p. m.)-yMont Pelee is still in violent
eruption. This morning an enormous
column of black smoke rose from the vol
cano to a height estimated at four miles
and then spread rapidly Into a mushroom
shaped cloud which appeared to have a
diameter | of forty miles. The spectacle
was impressive, but there were no detona
tions, no electrical displays, and no show
ers of ashes. Fort de France has been
shouded in intense gloom,' like that which
accompanies a total eclipse of the sun.
and Then Subsides.
Stormy. Sea Rises Nearly Three Feet
GLOOM AT FORT DE FRANCE.
The rising, up to the present, has been
confined to the right bank of the Mekong
and Is in Siamese territory. Should the
trouble reach the left bank the French
will at once dispatch troops to protect
that territory, which Is within the Frenca
sphere.
This slaughter has only excited the peo
ple of the vicinity to desperation and they
vow vengeance on the' King's soldiers.
The villagers have been holding their own
with the troops sent against them and
others were being dispatched to the scene
of the fighting.
The Premier. Lord Salisbury, said such
words coming from such a high authority
were gratifying and would be widely read.

Lord Goschen Makes a Statement
That Greatly Pleases Premier
Salisbury.
LONDON. June 6.â Prior to> the reading
of the loan bill in the House of Lords to
day, Lord Goschen, Liberal, and a former
Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced
that he desired to say a few words on the
financial position of the country. Consols,
which were now paying only 2^4 per cent,
stood at 97. Before the conversion of
1S8S, 3 per cent consols stood at 101. If
they had been converted then they would
have been worth only 82, so that the stock
was really 15 points higher. After a cost
ly war and the borrowing of Â£139,000,000.
the country might well congratulate itself
on a situation which showed such econom
ic stamina.
Let every Republican have a voice in select
ing delegates in open caucus, in each precinct.
Even then the sang will have the best of It.
for they are organized and their work is laid
out for them by the boss. They know their
candidates and vote together aa a unit, and
unless those opposed to the push are also or
ganized the gang is almost sure to get some
of the delegates. But the open caucus is the
only way to get even a semblance of fairness
in selecting delegates. If the bosaes wish
peace let them go way back and* sit down and
let the people manage their own affairs. This
will bring peace and it is the only way to have
honorable political peace which will insure
victory for the Republican party.
It is a disagreeable fact that the party In
this county has such a management that It Is
the imperative duty of good citizens to organ
ize for the purpose of placing better men at
its head and putting the party on a higher
plane than the - present bosses are able to
reach. '
In reply to this last onslaught, Thomp
son attacks the bosses and their method*.
He eays:
C. S. Mtlnes, the editor of the Times,
again attacked J. F. Thompson In a
scathing editorial this morning 1 .
The suit of Thompson against Bull,
Campbell and Monroe to enjoin them from
sending to Washington his resignation of
the receivership will be heard on Mon
day. It. is said that should Thompson win
charges will be preferred In "Washington
to accomplish his removal. The investi
gation into the charges made against S.
A: Campbell, Collector of the Port, is pro
ceeding before the Government official
behind closed doors, one witness at a time
being examined by the officer himself.
EUREKA. June 6.â Hotter waxes the
Humboldt County political feud. Each
faction is bitterly assailing the other
through the columns of the Times and
Standard respectively. The efforts of the
peacemakers, who believe the Republican
cause will be injured if the fight continue
in It3 present â¢ ferocity, have been Inef
fectual to bring about any kind of recon
ciliation. Both sides declare they will
not consider any proposition for an ad
justment of the difficulty. They say it is
a light to the bitter end. Each faction
will strive for control of the county con
vention, and the war promises to con
tinue until the have met.
Editor Thompson now accuses Camp
bell of offering $50 to Thomas McGeorge,
a former employe of the Standard, to use
his keys to gain entrance- to the news
paper office and ransack Thompson's pri
vate papers for an imaginary document.
Thompson names McGeorge as his in
formant. McGeorge denies that Camp
bell ever approached him and declares
that Thompson has deliberately published
a lie.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
It Is known now that the fugitive slept
on "Wednesday night in Kindred's Hotel,
Tokeland, and stayed there until 3 o'clock
Thursday afternoon. Before departing he
purchased $3 worth of canned goods and
j crackers at Fisher's store. In twenty
five minutes after his departure the stage
from Westport arrived, bringing- the news
'that he was wanted. Eight officers, be
sides many citizens, are now engaged in
the search for him.
Mrs. Underwood will be brought to the
King County Jail Immediately by one of
Sheriff Cudihee's deputies. She is at
present under guard in the Marshall home
at Aberdeen.
He Informed the Indian that men were
after him and that he would never be
taken alive.
SEATTLE, June 7.â Paul Underwood
had not been captured up to an early hour
last night* though the authorities are con
fident that he cannot escape them. A .mes
sage received from Sheriff Cudihee last
evening was to the effect that the man
wanted for the murder of his three
wceks-old baby at Ballaxd is believed to
be hidden in a mountain pocket near
Tokes Point and probably will be taken
before many hours have passed.
A special to the Post-Intelligencer from
South Bend received shortly Oefore mid
night, says Sheriff Roner returned to that
place last evening from a fruitless search
of the country about Tokeland. The
young man who crossed the river at Riv
erside was not Underwood. Sheriff Huff
is still at Tokeland. As no boats are
missing from that point it is believed
Underwood could not have crossed the
bay to Bruceport.
At Ocosta on Tuesday night Underwood
cut the telegraph wires leading to Aber
deen, where Sheriff Cudihee was stationed,
and then struck out for Tokeland. He
hired an Indian to row him across a small
inlet on Thursday night, and is believed
to be working his way slowly around
from South Bend.

tain Consistency.
"WASHINGTON, June 6.â Friends of the
Government Pacific cable bill lost hope
to-day when It became known that al
most the entire Democratic party In tho
House had finally decided to oppose the
rritasure. The leading Democrats have
takf-n the stand that the party could not
consistently support an American cable to
the Philippines and at the same time so
strenuously oppose American control.
Another "disappointment to the friends
af the bill is the postponement of consid

the formation of a heavy cloud, similar
to that of May 20 last, though it was not

KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent, June 4.âVes
sels leaving the island of Martinique have
experienced upheavals and agitations of
th6 sea, pointing to submarine eruptions
between Martinique and St. Lucia.
In the island of St. Vincent the fleecy
clouds which have been rising and
spreading In the direction of La Soufnere
since. May 16 and which have been mis
taken for tropical clouds have proved to
have been emitted from the crater of that
volcano. This, combined with renewed vi
brations in the fire zone, increased appre
hension that there might be another erup
tion of La Soufriere.
CRATERS IN SYMPATHY.
The eruptions at Martinique seem to re
lieve the St. Vincent volcano materially.
Connection between the two volcanoes is
indisputable, as every eruption In Mar
tinique is accompanied by seismic and at

mander, Captain Henderson, reported that
on May 9, at 10 p. m.. in latitude 5 degrees
south, longitude 43 degrees west, a.terri
.ble vibration was felt throughout the ves
sel, the shocks making it appear as if the
ship was bumping on rocks. At the same
\time the sea 'was violently agitated and
the crew was in a state of semi-panic.
The phenomena lasted a half-minute. It
was not until after relating his experi
ence that Captain Henderson heard of
the Martinique catastrophe.
LONDON, June Câ In connection with
the Martinique disaster letters arriving
here describe the negroes of that island
as holding orgies because "the whites are
; all dead. The negroes say they have
elected a negro governor, who counte
nances all exoesSes. Many of them Â¦ are
said to have enriched themselves by'loot

ERUPTIONS IN AiLASKA.
TACOMA, June 6. â While Redoubt and
Blackburn have been most active as re
gards recent volcanic eruptions in Alaska
two other peaks In the Cook Inlet section
have been throwing^ off smoke and steam
in greater or less volume for several
months. â¢ They are Mount Illiamna and
Mount Augustine. Captain O. A. John
sen, master of the Alasxa Commercial
Company's steamer Bertha, says that
frequently all of the volcanoes are belch-
Ing at once. He says:
â¢â¢Redoubt, though apparently subsiding,
is still active. When we were on the In
let, ten days ago, Redoubt, Illiamna and
Augustine were all smoking. Redoubt,
â¢when in greatest eruption, threw out
ashes on the windward side for a dis
tance of 200 miles. Latouch and Mon
tague Islands, that distance away, were
liberally covered with ashes. It is fre
quently the case, as I have observed from
the Bertha, that Redoubt, Illiamna and
Augustine are all throwing off smoke and
steam at once.
"Augustine, to my notion, Is by far the
most interesting In volcanic phenomena. It
is a mountain almost round and proba
bly thirty miles in circumference at the
base, gradually tapering to a height of
perhaps 6000 feet above sea level. It sits
gracefully in Kamchatka Bay, which is
really the entrance to Illiamna Bay. The
towering peak is not unlike a great chim
ney in appearance when It is emitting
smoke." l .
The conservatory shall be under the
control of a general Board of Regents
consisting of the President of the United
States, the President of the Sen
ate, the Speaker of the House of Rep

Mayor Schmitz has received a copy of a
proposed bill to establish a national con
servatory of music and art for the educa
tion of advanced pupils in music and all
Its branches, vocal and instrumental, as
well as painting, drawing and etching.
The bill has been introduced in tha
United States Senate. The bill was read

and other Interested organizations to the
bill to the end that their influence may
be exerted to secure its passage.
The bill provides that the conservatory

PLACES OF MEETING.
Subsequently there will be selected
executive committees in each district con
sisting of one member from each pre
cinit. The formation of these commit
tees will mean the completion of the most
elaborate campaign plan ever devised In
this city. The executive committee, dur
ing the intervals between the meetings of
the club, will be vested with power to act
in the name of the club. When fully or
ganized the committee, taken together,
will consist of 316 members.
The executive committees of all the dis
tricts shall come together at designated
times in general meetings, and while act
ing in such joint meetings shall be known
as the Central Committee of the Repub
lican Primary League.
There shall also be an advisory com
mittee of eighteen, consisting of one mem
ber selected from the executive commit
tee of each district. This committee will
meet from time to time with the board
of directors for the purpose of taking
concerted action in the interest of the
Republican party. The formation of the
committees In the districts and the joint
meetings of the advisory committee and
the board of directors will thus put all
portions of the league in constant touch
with each other and in continuous co
operation.
The board of directors desires' that the
league will be so organized that every
Republican shall have a voice in its man
agement. , In each of the eighteen As
sembly districts of the city there will be
established a Central Republican j Club.
The officers of each club shall be a presi
dent, two vice presidents, a secretary,'
treasurer and sergeant-at-arms. The offi
cers of the club will be selected at the
first meeting, Wednesday, June 11.
In order that no one might harbor ttie
least doubt as to the policy of the league,
the directors decided to again announce
its position. In unequivocal terms it was
declared that in the coming campaigns,
as in the past, the league will stand for
decency and cleanliness in political af
fairs, and that it is unalterably opposed
to the domination and the control of the
Republican party by Burns, Crimmins or
Kelly or any other boss. The policy of
the league, will be anti-boss in every re
spect. The league will also remain un
pledged for or against any candidate for
office. '
CENTRAL REPUBLICAN CLUBS.
The board of directors of the Republican
Primary League met last night at the
headquarters on Geary street to formu
late a plan of campaign for the approach
ing State and municipal elections. It was
decided- to organize Republican clubs next
Wednesday night in every Assembly dis
trict of the city, under the auspices of the
league. To these organization meetings
all Republicans who favor an honest
primary and a clean administration of the
affairs of the government are cordially
invited to attend. A hall has been se
cured in each district and the' meetings
will open at 8 o'clock. The formation of
these clubs, one in each district, will
prove in all probability the most exten
sive undertaking that has ever been at
tempted in the fight for pure politics in
this city. .
Affidavits have been prepared at the
request of the stockyards officers, who
professed to discredit the statement that
the men lost their positions for any such
cause. â¢
The question whether the issue will be
solved without resorting 1 to extreme meas
ures will be decided to-morrow, when
Donnelly is to meet the officers of the
stockyards company and present proof
that the seventeen members of the stock
yards employes' union were discharged
because they entered the union.
The issue was squarely made at a con
ference to-night between Michael Don
nelly, president of the Butchers' and
Meat Cutters' Union of North America
and A. G. Leonard, general manager of
the stockyards.
CHICAGO, June 6.â Unless the Union
Stock Yards Company shall agree to re
instate seventeen cattle-drivera who, it
is said, were discharged last Tuesday be
cause they were union men. the 5000 but
chers and meat cutters at the packing
houses and 700 stockyard employes will
not go to work Monday morning.
While Sheriff Rogers was busy to-day
summoning tho venire for the grand
jury, which has been called to investi
gate the charges made against County
Assessor Henry P. Dalton and G. B. Dan
iels, manager of the Oakland 'Enquirer,'
fresh chapters were added, to the story of
the Oakes-Stedman affidavits by the ac
cused official and the newspaper pub
lisher.
Now comes George A. Oakes with an
other athdavit, which recites and gives an
explanation from the Haywards post
master concerning the circumstances un
der which he maae the original statemenc
under oath,: which is coupled with that
of Russel Stedman as the basis for the
demand Attorney Emil Nusbaumer made
tor Dalton's and Daniels" arrest.
In this second affidavit, which was
made public to-night, Oakes declares
that ha was coerced into making his orig
inal statement about orders for books and
rolls and check transactions. He asserts
that Nusbaumer and Frank J. Moffltt urg
ed him into making the affidavit, after he
had been shown photographic copies of
the Lanktree' checks and the Stedman
affidavit in the original. Oakes says he
became alarmed because Nusbaumer .and
Moffltt told him the 1 books and rolls were
not in the Assessor's office, and he feit
he was in a serious position and liable to
be arrested for felony.
That position, it may be explained, was
due to the fact that Oakes had sworn to
the correctness of the claims which were
paid by the county for- the thirty mort
gage books and seventy-five working as
, eessment rolls Stedman has sworn were
never made nor delivered^
NUSBAUMER ON THE PHONE.
Oakes affidavit is as follows: t .
Georee A.' Oakes. beinjc sworn, denoses and
says upon his oath, relative to the circum
stances of his making an afndavit before Emil
Nusbaumer, notary public, on tho 1st of June,
the present month, concerning the order given
him by H. P. Dalton, County Assessor, for the
making of thirty mortgage assessment books
and seventy-five working rolls for the Assess
or's office and concerning the negotiating of
tho orders for said books and working rolls,
which were negotiated through J. B. Lanktree,
that the facts and circumstances ot his making
said affidavit are as follows: On Saturday
evening the 3\Â«t of May. affiant having been
at San Francisto during the day. returned to
his home at HaVwards and upon his arrival
lie called at the "Villa in Haywards, that
being the place formerly kept by his father
and being now the "central office of the tele
phone at Haywards, after 8 o'clock- In the
evening; there he was informed by the man
cger of the place that a gentleman had been
there and had left a request that affiant call
up telephone in Oakland, the number of which
was given; affiant did call up the number and
was answered, and thereupon he asked who it
was that had answered the call and the reply
was that It was Emil Nusbaumer; affiant then
ticked what was wanted and Nusbaumer an
swered that he wanted to see affiant in Oak
land; that thereupon an appointment was
made over the telephone for a meeting between
affiant and Nusbaumer for the next day (Sun
day), the 1st instant, at 10 o'clock in the
forenoon, the meeting to be at the office of
Reed &. Nusbaumer.
After making this appointment affiant went
to his house and there his wife Informed him
that a gentleman named Hanson had called
to see him and had been around there most of
tne day looking for him.
A BREST THREATENED.
The next morning affiant came, in accord
ance with the appointment, to. Oakland and
Ment Immediately : to the offipÂ© of Reed &
Nusbaumer and met there Emil Nusbaumer,
no person else being tnere. 'Nusbaumer Im
mediately opened the subject of his object In
calling affiant to Oakland by saying that af
fiant had placed himself In a very serious posi
tion in connection with the matter of the
order for the books and the negotiating of it
and the payment of It by the county; that he
had In' his possession the original or photo
graphic copies of the bills or orders as they
passed the Board of Supervisors, with the
names of. the Finance Committee of the Super
visors who "had. approved them; also that he
liad photographic copies of. the checks of J. B.
Lanktree. which had been received by affiant '
from Lanktree on negotiating said orders, said
checks being respectively for $000 and $DOU;
and he exhibited to affiant the said photo
graphic copies of the checks and also tho affi
davit of R. B. Stedman concerning the same
matters. Ho said, tnat affiant was
liable to be arrested In connection with the
matter, but that affiant could save himself
by making: an affidavit concerning the facts.
Vffiant and Nusbaumer had considerable con
versation and then Mr. Nusbaumer stepped out
of the room, but In a short time returned
again Five or ten minutes later Frank J.
Moflltt came into the room. There were then
present Mr. Nusbaumer, Mr. Moffltt' and
Â¦ affiant Nusbaumer and Moffitt urged affiant
to make an affidavit. Affiant refused at first
end for a considerable time, and they said
that by his refusal to make an affidavit wculd
make it appear that he was guilty and that
t-e was liable to be arrested; Affiant rtated
to them that he had done nothing wron? In
the matter; that he could see nothing in his
conduct for which he should be arrested.
AITIANT IS THREATENED.
Moffltt said that the books and rolls were
not in the Assessors office and that there was
no doubt of it. and that that circumstance
made affiant liable criminally; and Nusbaumer
Sonflrmed that statement very strongly. Nat
urally affiant became alarmed and felt that ho
really was in a very serious position and liable,
to be arrested for felony. Up to the beginning
of the interview with Nusbaumer affiant had
never heard, nor had an Intimation that the
books and rolls were^not In the Assessor's or
flce- that he was not satisfied that they were
not 'there even upon Mr. Isusbaumer's assur
ance; but Mr. Moffltt when he came in said
that he was absolutely positive and certain
that the books and rolls were not in the As
sessor's office and that there was no doubt
about it. Thereupon affiant supposing that the
information of Moffltt and Nusbaumer con
cerning the books and rolls was correct/and!
feeling himself to be thereby placed In a very
serious criminal position, he made the affidavit
before Mr. Nusbaumer. as a notary public,
but before he signed tho affidavit Mr. Nusl
baumer assured him that they were not going
to use It. but that the making of it was neces
sary for affiant's protection. Affiant believed
what they told him to be true, still he rather
objected to sign Ins. and Nusbaumer said. "Oh,
Â«t<*n It" and at last affiant did so. *

Since Shear has been in San Francisco
he has stopped at the Golden West hotel
and has been passing as a salesman for
safes.
Shear, who is a well dressed man about
fifty years of age, says he has been in
this city about a month, coming herÂ©
from Monterey. He admitted making his
headquarters at Denver for the past ten
months, and says he collected some money
for a firm of safe dealers by whom he
was employed which he converted to his
own use. He denied that he had been in
Boston for four years past, and said the
circulars could not refer to him. although
engravings of his own photograph con
fronted him. Under persistent question-
Ing he explained an entry in Plnkerton's
criminal record, accompanied by a photo
graph of liimself, giving his occupation
as a forger and regarding his arrest In
1893. by saying that he knew the roan re
ferred to and that he bore considerable
resemblance to him, but he. denied any
connection with the crime.
Leroy C. Shear, who is said by the
police to be one of the most noted forgers
in the country, was arreste/i on Market
gin-et last night about 10 o'clock by Detec
tives McMahon, Dinan and Wren. His
latest exploit in his particular line was
performed In Denver under the name of
Gay Moore, and it was on telegraphic ad
vices from that city that he was arrested.
Investigation by the police disclosed that
the prisoner is wanted under his real
name in Boston for forgery alleged to
have been committed March 4, 1902. Pho
tographs and measurements sent out by
the Boston department leave no question
of his identity.
Captain of Detectives Martin says the
prisoner is wanted in various cities of
the United States under the aliases of
Charles R. Clark. Frank Mallory. W. M..
Davis. C. M. Watbers and H. Brassington,
under which last r.ame he was known in
San Francisco. On the prisoner's person

Their predicament was seen by the look,
out on board the McCulloch. The ship's
smallboat with two men was sent to the
rescue and succeeded In taking the couple
aboard. The heavy sea and - wind, i how
ever, were too much for the sailors, and
little headway was .made toward; land.
Finally the McCulloch's officer ordered
the ship's lifeboat to be lowered, and with
six men and an ensign went to the rescue
of the two small craft. , After a line was
made fast the young couple and their res
cuers were towed back Into port and safe
ly landed.
When in the choppy sea the craft keeled
over and Miss Bettincourt was' thrown

Coffee almcst kills some people before
they are willing to admit that coffee is
really the cause of the trouble. Tet it is
easy to break off the habit providing
Postum Coffee, well boiled, Is served In
Its place.
A lady says: "After coffee drinking had
become a habit with me I experienced a
eense of faintness In the stomach with
lassitude and dullness of the mind. This
was accompanied with severe pains in
the region of my liver.
"Gradually my health failed and I be-
came thin and a nervous wreck, having
Elck headaches every day. Then Insom-
r.ia set in- and I suffered for four years
cuch torments as those who have been
through the experience know of. At night
I would grow bo nervous over the con-
tinual distress in my stomach that I
would imagine hundreds of little red
devils had strings attached to the back of
my stomach and were trying to pull it
out. I was compelled, at times, to take
laudanum to relieve the distress and
cramps.
"This condition lasted with some varia-
tion for about three years. I tried vari-
ous physicians and finally was advised
to try leaving off coffee; this I thought
cculd not be done. I was finally Induced
to give up coffee and use Postum and I
began to get well.
"When I recovered and thought I was
well enough to go back to coffee again I
tried it, but after ueing it a short time
the old stomach trouble came back and I
threw the balance of the coffee in the
etove. There has never been a grain of
the old-fashioned coSÂ«o in the house
tii.ee and never will be as long as I am
running it.
"Postum Coffee Is delicious when made
according to directions and served hot,
with good cream and some , sugar. The
whole family use it and enjoy fit greatly.
I have gained 40 pounds in the last year
and my nerves are fast becoming a thing
of the past. I sleep perfectly all night

annual meeting in the Mills building yes
terday. It was decided to apportion the
trout and black bass fry, of which there
are large quantities on hand, somewhat
differently than heretofore and several
new streams will be benefited thereby.
More attention will be given in the future
to the propagation of Eastern brook trout.
It has been found that they thrive won
derfully in small streams in the higher
localities. .

Ir. the side door on Gough street had been

Attempts at Burglary.
. John R. Armstrong, who says he is
president of the Golden Gate Mining Com
pany, appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday on two charge's of obtaining
money by false pretenses. After hearing
the testimony of B. Arnot and D. Gay,
the complaining witnesses, who alleged
that Armstrong got $25 from each on the
representation that he could obtain em
ployment for them in Nome, the Judge
held that as there was not any corrob
orative evidence the cases would be dis
missed. He was satisfied there were ear
marks of a flimflam game, and he thought
Armstrong I would be acting wisely and
justly in paying the money back, which
ho did. "
Armstrong Pays Money Back.
' The addition of Mrs. Hallldie's collec
tion of pictures, which are being exhibit
ed temporarily at the Institute, attracted
much attention. Mrs. Marcus Koshiand
also has a picture on view in the gallery.
It is "The Accident," by W. Geets, which
was purchased by Mrs. Koshiand in Mu
nich. The artist shows his ability as a
painter of, figures, his children being par
ticularly excellent and forming perhaps
the most interesting of the group that is
anxiously awaiting the action of a man
whose indecision as to effecting a rescue
adds to the dramatic treatment. The
frantic woman and the excited populace
are strongly pictured, and while there is
a presence of stiffness and a good deal
that is mechanical it Is a canvas t~at
must command respect. Another picture
that is being much talked about and en
joyed at the Institute is Jules Tavernler'3
"Lying in Wait." A number of the pic
tures have been rearranged and very good
judgment has been shown in this respect.
There was a large and fashionable at

The San Francisco Labor Council met
last night and adopted various amend
ments to the constitution of that body.
The delegates from the Gas Workers' Un
ion were seated.
The meeting of the dissatisfied millmen,
who are anxious to secure a charter from
the brotherhood, will be watched with in
terest by all connected with the building
trades. Should It develop that the mill
men have the numerical strength to carry
out their purpose the cause of the broth
erhood will assume proportions against
which the Building Trades Council will
find it a hopeless task to battle. On the
other hand, should the millmen fail of
their purpose the Building Trades Council
will be in a position to dictate to the
mill owners, so that reprisals may follow.
Some of the millmen are confident that
after the end of the current month there
may be trouble In the mills, but the
brotherhood men declare, on the con
trary, that the danger exists only in tho
imagination of those to whom the wish is
father to the thought.
Carpenters' Union 1082 met last night
and received a report that the millwrights
themselves are divided upon the subject
of the brotherhood. Some of the men in
the Millwrights' Union are desirous of
Joining the brotherhood, while others fear
that by doing so they will be at outs with
the Building Trades Council. The stum
bling block sec-ma to be the working card
ot the carpenters, and the question now
is which card the master builders will
recognize after July 1. Should they de
cJde to recognize only the card of the
Building Trades Council and not that of
the brotherhood there must of necessity
be trouble. On the other hand, should
the contractors continue to remain neu
tral in the fight, as they have done in the
past, the danger of serious trouble among
the unions will have been averted.
This action is regarded as a decisive
blow aimed at the Building grades Coun
cil in its fight against the Brotherhood
of Carpenters. Its effect is likely to be
far-reaching, because it indicates that as
far as the millmen are concerned the af
filiated unions of the council are in open
rebellion against the council itself. That
this was caused by the orders issued dur
ing the fight of the carpenters, to affiliated
union men to quit jobs on which brother
hood men were employed is regarded by
the brotherhood men as certain. The men
who remained loyal to the brotherhood
are rejoicing over the outlook, which Is
full of promise of victory for them in
their battle for the constitutional rights
which they declare were not granted to
them by the constitution of the Building
Trades Council when a section was incor
porated therein depriving them of the
right to affiliate with no central body oth
er than i the Building Trades Council
itself.
The determination of many of the mlll
nien who were recently supended from
the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Join
ers to apply for reinstatement, for which
purpose a special meeting of the millme.i
has been called for this evening at 915^i
Market street, has spread consternation
in the ranks of the Building Trades Coun
cil. - :

The Baroda, bound from Callao to Ore
gon, went ashore on the night of August
29, 1901. about nine miles south of the Co
quille River. She went high and dry, and
shortly after the disaster there came
along a series of spring tides that sent
her still farther inland. Those that saw
her said it would be impossible to get her
back to the water. The owners claimed
for a total loss and the underwriters paid
without demur. As a sort of forlorn hope,
however, they sent out from Scotland
Captain Burns, a mariner in whose judg
ment they had unlimited faith. Burns ex
amined the wreck, said he could get her
afloat and was laughed at by local wreck
sharps. The underwriters knew Burns
better than did the wiseacres of the Pa
cific Coast. They told him to go ahead.
He did. He has spent a good deal of
money and some of his attempts proved
failures. But the Baroda is now afloat
and the underwriters have a valuaole
ship to offset the amount paid the former
owners. According to a dispatch received
yesterday at the Merchants' Exchange
she was floated on Thursday night. She
is now at Coos Bay, where she will load
ballast before starting for this port. Cap
tain Burns will see her safely in San
Francisco before he leaves for Scotland.
AFTER months of preparation, car
ried on in the face of discourag
ing comment that at. times
amounted almost to ridicule, the
British bark Baroda has been
lifted from her grave in the Oregon sands
and is now afloat and safely at anchor in
Coos Bay. To Captain Burns of Scotland;
a determined sailor man sent out by the
British underwriters, is due the credit of
the achievement.

Stocks opened weak throughout the list and
Kaffirs were flat, but South African houses
for the first time supported these shares, and
they closed generally distinctly . better. The
preliminary arrangement of the mining ac
count indicates that speculation is considerably
reduced. If so a rise fs expected to com
mence soon. The Continent supported con
sols, which sold at 96%.
Americans began heaVy and rallied on a
rumor from Berlin that the coal strike had
been settled. New York denied the rumor
but prices maintained the rise. The close was
cheerful. Canadian Pacific fluctuated erratical
ly. It ope.ned weak at 136% and fell to 135%
on Canadian sales, but New York and Berlin
suddenly bid up to 140%, and Montreal turned
buyer. Coupled with the announcement of a
new Canadian steamship line contemplated to
outbid the Morgan combination, there are very
conflicting stories current regarding a ship

NEW YORK, June 6. â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say:
Crop prospects taken as a whole are really
brilliant. Railroad earnings are enormous,
despite the small grain tonnage, bank clear
ings are quite heavy, notwithstanding the
speculative dullness, and failures are fewer in
number than in recently preceding years. â¢ The
ending of the Boer war, It is also thought,
will have a tendency to stimulate export busi
ness in manufactures, though Interfering in
trades in horses, mules and 'Other articles of
export. On the other hand, the industrial sit
uation, although improved by the ending of
blast furnacemen's and teamsters' strike, is
still a depressing one, owing to the prospect
of the anthracite coal strike proving a long
and bitter one. threats of . strikes In the
bituminous fields and the general unrest noted
among workers in a number of industries. In
connection with the industrial unrest it is
to be observed that many of the demands made
now and for some time past have been based
on higher prices for food. Â¦
Warmer weather has stimulated spring re
order business In dry goods, rather more ac
tivity being noted by Jobbers the country over.
Leather Is rather quiet.'
New York Stock Market.
; NEW YORK, June 6. â The dealings in stocks
dropped back again to near the low level of
activity lor the year and the day's changes
are narrow and unimportant. So far as they
are gains they are the residue of a little spurt
in prices with which the day started. It was
caused by a rumor that the coal strike had
been settled, which came by way of London,
with a light volume of cabled orders to buy,
the origin of which was as doubtful as that
or the rumor. This was undoubtedly a ruse
and was designed as a counter move to ye3.
ttrday's reiHtrts eat afloat by the bears of the
sudden death of an aged financier. The prtn
cipai buying came from yesterday's short sen
em, and as soon as the rumor was authori
tatively denied, the buying movement Xell away
and the market relapsed Into its state oi
neglect, 'there was a sharp rally in the Cai>
auian Pacincs on a resumption 01 tne pool
operations in that stock, and this movement
had some sympathetic influence on the rent I
or ihe ilst- Th^e later maricex was inclined to,
aepressiun and there seemed to be a teeling
ui resignation to a season oi dullness. Opinion*
irom abroad are current that there will be
no notable revival Irom abroad In toreigii
markets as an effect of the declaration uf
peace until alter the English coronation. The
continuance of the coal strike, which seems to
promise Indefinite prolongation, will also be a.
damper on any speculative enthusiasm. The
assembling of the soft coal miners in the Vir
1 ginia and West Virginia fields and reports that
they will go on a strike give color to the ap
prehension of an extensive spread of labor
troubles. The strength of to-day's corn mar
ket and the reports whieh accompanied it of
excessive rains and floods in the Southwest
were a reminder of the possibilities of future
mishaps to the corn crop and an incentive to
caution against speculative commitments on
that score. The bank statement promises to
be colorless. There have been sufficient re
ceipts on balance from the Interior to about
offset the week's $2,000,000 loss on sub-treasury
operations. There is no Indication of any sub
stantial reduction in the loan account of the
banks and some institutions report an Increase
In that Item. A reaction in foreign exchange
was viewed with satisfaction and relieved the
apprehension caused by the week's advance of
a disposition by foreign lenders to withdraw
credits. The market closed stagnant.
The bond market was also less active and
the movement of prices narrow and Irregular
Total sales, par value, $2,650,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Oregon Crop Bulletin.
The report of Edward A. Beals, section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin, week^ ended June 3, is as
follows:
The past week has been one of great extremes
in temperature. The first two day6 were bright
and warm, after which It turned cool and
cloudy. Frequent small showers have falle*
during the later portion of the week, and on
several mornings during temporary clearing
spells light frosts occurred In the eastern por
tion of the State.
The eondUion of grain continues good, spe
cially in the eastern portion of the State. There
has been plenty of moisture for spring-sown
wheat, and as the plant has stooled nicely the
yield rromiEes to be larger than usual. Fall
Â¦v.heat is heading, but owing to the cool weather
is making slow advancements, and steady, mild
temperatures are now needed to mature a
plump and hard kernel.
Sorr.e alfalfa has been cut In Southern Ore
gon, arid clover and alfalfa is generally ready
for harvesting, -which is retarded by the unset
tled condition of the weather. Pastures con
tinue in excellent condition and stock is now
lat and sleek. Sheep shearing Is progressing
slowly and .be clip will probably be an aver
age one.
Sugar beets In Union County are being
thinned and the crop is doing nicely. Gardens,
corn, potatoes and hops all need warm weather,
but they continue thrifty and promising, al
though very backward.
The warm weather during the first of the
week brought in a number of encouraging fruit
reports to the effect that the damage to prunes,
cherries and pears was not as great as expect
ed. 1Â«M the weather later became unfavorable,
and the damage In the Willamette Valley to
Italian prunes. Royal Anne cherries and Bart
lett pear* is considerable. In Southern and
Eastern Orepon the fruit outlook is very prom
ising, and there will undoubtedly be plenty of
I.erries in all parts of the State. Early apples
have dropped badly, but winter apples, as far
Â«s can be determined, have eet nicely.

NEW YORK, June 6. â R, G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Peace in South Africa has greatly improved
the outlook. * Foreign Industrial markets will
quickly benefit by the development of that
country, while a return to, active gold mining
will have a helpful influence in monetary cir
cles. Owing to the present exceptional home
consumption, producers in this country may not
be able to take advantage of the opportunity
immediately, but even the indirect effects must
be beneficial. Domestic conditions have still
but the one drawback of labor disputes, which
have reduced the earning power of a large
force. Outside the limits of this influence there
is little cause for complaint. Orders are large.
Railway earnings for May show an Increase of
6.8 per cent over last year and 17.4 per cent
over 1900.
Contrary to expectations, the leading pro
ducers maintained their conservative position
by making no advance in the price of steel
rails for delivery in 1903, notwithstanding the
very material rise that has occurred in pig
iron.
Satisfactory weather In the leading producing
regions had a depressing influence on grain
quotations, and last week's advance was lost.
Cash prices were slow to react, owing to the
extremely strong statistical position, but the
next' crop options, fully reflected the progress
at the farms.
Failures this week In the United States were
218 against 194 last week, and 192 the pre
ceding week and. 185 the corresponding week
last year, and In Canada 16 against 20 last
week, 12 the preceding week and 20 last year.

Harrison' 3 circular Â»ays: "Coal arrivals for
the past week are as follows: Three from
British Columbia. 8032 tons; two from Oregon,
930 tons: three from Washington, 10,922 tons;
one from Australia (Newcastle). 2195 tons; to
tal, 22.079 tons. It Is singular that with the
apparent light demand for steam coals, and the
average quantity arri vinlgr this and several
weeks past, there is no accumulation In yards.
About all the deliveries of coal for steam pur
poses are now being made offshore, which nar
rows down Its demand almost entirely to bay
and ocean steamers. The transports are call
ing for their usual quantities, which aggregate*
a very large portion of all that is imported.
Prices are still low for both coal and oil. so
that manufacturers cannot complain at the
cost of their motive power in producing their
output. Coal freights from Australia, and
Great Britain do â¢ not Â«how any improvement,
yet the list of vessels loading for this port does
not diminish. Fuel oil will, in a short time, be
shipped to the Sandwich Islands, which will in
crease the direct shipments of coal from Aus
tralia to San Francisco. A reduction of $1 per
ton on Wellington coal has been made this
week. This is a voluntary concession on th*
part of the agent here, and as oil cuts no figure
for domestic uses, the reduction becomes the
1 more praiseworthy."

HanTordâ Fruit crops ripening rapidly. Apri
cots doing well. Pasturage and grain good.
Hollisterâ Hay curing well and being rapidly
put up; good quality. .
Livermore â Weather very favorable for
crops. Wheat crop will be light.
Napa â Haylngr in progress; fair crop.
Xewman â Grain filling- well; barley harvest
ed: yield and quality poor.
Riverside â New Oranges setting well, but
small for season.
San Jose â Grain and fruit good; big crop of
all kinds.
Santa Maria â Chevalier and oats are ripen

good.
Santa ' Rosa â Haying progressing; quality

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
market was featureless. Snow figures out the
total crop at 725,000.000 bushels, against 752,
000,000 last year. Secretary of Agriculture
Wilson, now at St. Louis." says that the Win
ter Wheat crop Is a bumper and now beyond
danger from rust. Oregon, /'Washington and
California look favorably, but under the very
best possible conditions will fall at least
5,000,000 bushels under last year. Ocean
freights are weak and present indications
favor an indefinite period of cheap - ships.
Bradstreet's gave the total exports of Wheat
and Flour for the week at 4,600,000 bushels.

poor and sold slowly at 25Â©30c per dozen. A

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Receipts of Butter were heavy again, as will
be seen. Prices were quoted steady, however,
though most dealers reported more on hand
than they cared to have. The two Interests
already mentioned are operating against one
another, one wanting the market up and the
other wanting It to stay where it is, and be
tween them the feeling is unsettled and. un
' satisfactory.
The firmness In Eggs continues, but there la
no change in quotations. Stocks, while still
liberal, are not as large as they were, and re
ceipts are nÂ«r longer excessive. The Eastern
now coming in are going 1 into storage.
Cheese quotations show ' some narrow
changes. The market continues well supplied
and quiet.' â¢.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Changes In Berries were slight. Choice offer
ings sold readily at full figures, but as usual
there were some poor Strawberries that had to
be sold below the quotations.
Receipts of loose Cherries were very large,
and the market had an easier tone. Only strict!
ly fancy Black In small lots brought Be per
lb, and 60c was the extreme for choice stock
in boxes.' ...
A few small consignments of Apples. Pears
and Plums came in and . sold slowly at the
quotations. Receipts of . Apricots were more
liberal and prices were lower. Peaches of the

not sold. A box of /Black Figs was received
from Palm Springs . and sold .for $2 60.

ST. FBANCIS PABISH
TO HOLD AN OUTING
The principal holders from whom land
will be purchased are the Big Basin
Lumber - Company, Timothy Hopkins
Menlo Park; McAbee Bros.. Boulder
Creek; I. T. Bloom. Boulder Creek; H. D
Rossiter. San' Franciaco; L.. Coburn, Pes
cadero: Eberhard Tanning Company; D
J. West, San Jose, and the D.G.'Part
ridge estate. |
In the years to come when San Francisco's
population has reached the million mark, and
the other surrounding cities have correspond
ingly Increased, this Big Basin will. afford one
of the finest recreation grounds In the State.
The reason the board has conducted all Its
business so eecretly is that It wished to get
the. land. at as low a figure as possible, and
I'ubllcity would have caused the property hold
en> in that â¢ eectlon to hold out for the best
l>rice pcesible. . The commission has only
wished to act for the State's best Interests.
It has . necessarily been. a tedious Job to hunt
up the numerous owners of land In' the Basin
and secure terms of sale satisfactory to each
side. With the completion of a few minor
details, the work of the commission will have
been accomplished. All of the Commissioners
are favorably impressed with the new natural
park site, and Big Basin Park Is an assured
fact. Some of the land will cpst $100 an acre,
some less. Ii. 1_. Mlddleton.of the Big Basin
Lumber Company, who holrls the largeet part
,of thÂ« desirable land, will sell the best portion
of it for $100 an acre, but he will throw in
a lot of leas attractive land for $10 an acre,
so the average price- will not be great. It
is the intention of ' the commission to secure
as much land as the money will buy.
CAUSE OF SECBECY.
It Is an assured fact that the Big Basin will
be purchased as soon as the details can be
arranged. The commission lias not acted upon
It as yet, but will Jo so In the near future.
The public will be given a wonderful park,
a piece of wild land that abounds with large
redwoods. One of th>s clauses of the bill ap
propriating $250,000 for a park was that the
land bought should contain an excellent growth
of California's characteristic tree.
It will be remembered that Makinney's
daughter, as soon as the park scheme
was sprung, attempted to take up a sec
tion on the outskirts of the basin, and
iÂ» was thought that she intended try
ing to resell it to the Park Commission.
Governor Gage at once telegraphed to
Senator Perkins at Washington and re
quested him to have the Government
withdraw from entry all lands in the Big
Basin, pending the examination by the
Park Commission of lands wanted foi
the public park. The. services of an ad
visory board composed of the following
prominent. citizens conversant on the sub
ject of timber and timber lands was then
enlisted to examine the property: N. P.
Chipman. president of tRe State Boara
of Trade; W. W. Van Arsdale of Slski
you County; Robert Dollar, Hervey
Lindley, A. B. Hammond of Portland
owner of the Columbia River and Astoria
Railroad, and Drury Melone of N"apa_
Thls committee reported favorably upon
the Big Basin site. and. another commit
tee was appointed to look into the titles
of the property. The committee was com
posed of A. W. Foster, Professor Dudley
and W. H. Mills.
Professor Dudley, in speaking of the
purchase yesterday, said:
BIG BASIN SITE FAVORED.
Professor Dudley also say's the commis
sion has in mind the purchase of 14,000
acres of good timber land. That portion
of the Big Basin owned by the Â¦ United
States Government is separated from the
land i he commission has decided to buy
by a half section, which will be< t pur
chased when the Government turns it
over to the State. The land which it was
said Miss Makinney wanted to take up
and resell to the commission was not
considered, as it is almost devoid of
trees. It "was thought that the fact that
H. E. Makinney owned land through
which the west fork of Waddell flows
would endanger the water supply
of the park should he cut oil the stream.)
Professor Dudley says there is no dan
ger on that score, however, as the prop
erty owned by Makinney is not irav
orsed by the creek until after it passes
through the land which the commission
has decided to buy.
Professor Dudley, secretary of the com
mission, says ' tliat' hone, of the sections
desirable lor a park are assessed to un
known owners. "No land, except one
piece of ninety acres, will be bought from
ri. E. MaSiinnoy.as his property has no
redwoods U'HMI it."
. The Dig Basin Park Commissioners
have decided to purchase the property
known as the "Big Basin of'Santa Cruz."
The commission, composed of W. H.
Mills tchairman). A. W. Foster, Professor
William . Russel Dudley of Stanford.
Father R.'E. Kenna. president of Santa
Clara College.' and Governor Gage tex
otncio member), has at last arranged for
the purchase of the different holdings In
the Big" Basfn section. Considerable
trouble was experienced in making terms
with the numerous holders of the land.
As a matter of fact, we have been keeping a
â¢trlct watch throughout the entire State for
â¢my r'olatlons of the oleomargarine law and
have not during the last year found a single
violation on the part of retailers or whole
ealers.
In crder to continue the traffic In the article
the manufacturers evidently are determined
to push tlie sale of the uncolored goods bear
ing the sma.II tax of one-quarter of a cent.
I don't think the Armour, capsule method
w:ll meet with much success. Families are
not going ts purchase oleomargarine knowing
it to be such and then take the trouble to
*->o}ot it. Hotels and restaurants and-boardlng
heufcs, it is true, are still restricted from
using it except In Its uncolored state.
Hitherto there has been a United States law
requiring a 2-cent tax on oleomargarine, or
butterine, whether colored or not. The new
law r.assed by Congress and which goes Into
effect July 1 changes the tax to one-quarter of
t cent on all uncolored oleomarearlne. while
15. raises the tax on colored oleomarearlne to
30 cer.ts, which is considered prohibitive b)
mar.y.
Armour can sell all the oleomarsarlne he
likes, but if it is not In accord with the law
ot the State he will make himself liable and
we Â«shall not hesitate to take speedy action for
the protection of the dairy interests es well ai
these of the public. The law of this State
tr.akis it illegal to ofTer for ealÂ« any *uhstance
or compound other lhan that made from pure
milk cr crc&ra anJ made in the semblance of
butter:
William H. Saylor, assistant secretary
in charge of the State Dairy Bureau, said
yesterday in the absence of Mr. Thomas:

lives at 136 Sixth street. Stiglmeier want
ed a warrant for the arrest of his wife
Alma and Frank J. Gallery, who, he said,
had been living for over a year as hus
b'smd and wife in a house on Alabama
street, near Seventeenth. The warrants
were issued.
SUglmeler said that he had been mar
ried tor nearly ten years, but there were
no children. Gallery worked for him and
became friendly with his wife. 'Gallery
left Chicago in March last year, saying
he was going to a summer resort in Mich
igan leaving a wife and child behind.
About five weeks later Mrs. Stiglmeier
told him she wanted to go to California
for her health, and he gave her $100 to
i>ay her fare and expenses. Since that
time he had not heard from. her. but re
cently he learned, he alleged, from two
women with whom she corresponded that
she was in this city with Gallery. He
had also learned that she had told people
ii> Chicago that she was going away with
Gallery. He communicated with his
friend Marco and after hearing from him
came on here.
Gallery, who was employed in the Mont
gomery market, was arrested by Detec
tives McMahon and Anthony, and later
they arrested Mrs. Stiglmeier at the house
on Alabama street. They were bovh
locked up in the City Prison. Mrs. Stigl
meier, who Is a comely looking woman,
accuses her husband of having beaten,
kicked and abused her for years till she
was forced to leave him. She came here
with her brother, A. Conrad, a butcher
employed in a shop on Sixth street, .be
tween Folsom and Bryant, and claims she
has been keeping houso for him. She and
her brother met Gallery on the street
shortly after they came here, and at her
brother's request he came and boarded
at the house. She denies that they were
living as husband and wife. She has en
gaged Attorney McWilliams to defend
her. a - -Â¦â¢

â Worth buying, too. Let's first look at these
Boys' and Girls' Stockings lOc pair.
They are heavy ribbed, seamless, long and elastic, double knees â
sizes 5^2 to 9V2 â ioc a pair or a 'dozen at $1.10.
Next are these Misses' Black Lace Hose 22c â fine Lisle,, with
lace openwork from ankle to top â longer and more elastic than the or-
dinary stocking â sizes 5 Z A to 0. J4- One of the prettiest and best stock-
ings of the season â 22c a pair or a dozen at $2.50.
Our Famous "Iron-thread" Stockings 25c,
or a dozen at $2.75.
It's the stocking of all stockings for service. We see that the
â¢ hardest twisted elastic yarn jzoes into it; that the heels and toes are
fashioned and that the ankles are narrowed. No stockings we know of
have the thought and care put into them for the money that these
have. Sizes 6 to 10 â every pair stamped "Iron Thread" â and guaran-
