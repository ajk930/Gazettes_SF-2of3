-*r yASHIXGTON, April 17.
11 yH / General debate on the
H /B / - Cuban reciprocity bill
Â¦r jar will close to-morrow at
* * Z o'clock, and it is the
intention of the House
leaders. If possible, to force a final .vote
on the passage of the bill before adjourn
ment to-morrow night. All day long the
leaders were counting noses and prepar
ing for the final struggle to-morrow. The
Democrats are badly split " on the bill.
The opponents of tfce bill occupied most
cf the time of the debate to-day, the
feature being a vigorous speech by Cusn
znan (R.) of Washington against the
measure. Cushman arraigned the Com
mittee on Rules and the House leaders
In a breezy aJid at times sensational fash
ion. A portion of his criticism was in a
eemi-humorous vein, but some of it was
decidedly caustic. De Armond, one of the
leading Democrats of Â£he House, deliv
ered a forcible speech in favor of tariff
reduction on trust articles. The other
rpeakers were Pierce of Tennessee. Doug
las of New York and Lacey of Iowa for
the bill, and Jenkins of Wisconsin,
Gainea of West Virginia, Warner of Illin
ois, Gardner of Michigan, Jones of Wash
ington and Loud of California against It.
Loud declared that directly and indirectly
Cuba already had cost the United States
one thousand million dollars. Â¦ ' .
OPPOSITION TO BILL.
The House began its session at 11
o'clock in order to expedite the Cuban
reciprocity bill. A veto message was re
ceived from President Roosevelt of a bill
pensioning Thomas F. \ Walter, and was
referred to the Committee on - Invalid
Pensions.
Consideration of the Cuban reciprocity
bill was resumed and Jenkins of Wiscbn
eln spoke on the political status of Cuba,
maintaining that there could be no sus
pended sovereignty, and that at the pres
ent time Cuba was under the political do
minion of the United States.
Jenkins opposed the bill because our
relations toward Cuba .were not (such as
to permit of the proposed reciprocity
treaty. .
Gaines of West Virginia also opposed
the bill, declaring that It was unnecessary
and unwise.
Warner of Illinois, who followed, "was
also against the bill. He insisted that the
measure waÂ« not along Republican lines
end when he declared that at heart a
majority of the members on the Repub
lican side were opposed to the Republican
measure, the Republican opponents of the
bill gave him a round of applause.
DE ARMOND AND TRUSTS.
De Armond of Missouri made a speech
Â¦which attracted much attention. He em
ployed his vitriolic comment upon the at
titude of members with his accustomed
freedom. Calling attention to the fact
that members of bpth sides, whether
tb*}~ opposed or advocated the measure,'
Cushman of Washington made a breezy
5?peecri against the bill. . He declared . that
a majority of the Republican House to
day were* opposed,". although^ a majority,
were to-day; convinced that it 1 would 'Â¦ be
better for them'tb favor it.; He intimated
CUSHMAN, ; SCORES SYSTEM.
as opposed.; to Â¦ the. proposition he refuses
to consider." (Democratic applause.) Â¦ ' ; i
"That will be our chance." he said.
"You are either, for this trust or you
are ag.Unst it. If you are against It do not
let a spider-web rule stand in your path.1
I,', for one, do not purpose to allow- Buch
a film to bar my way when I have" an op
portunity to , do service for the j Ameri
can, people. The man. who votes to sus
tain ; the chair will stand in hlstory/ahd
before his" constituents and- this ; House
But De Armond warned .Â¦ the members
that they could not Justify themselves
with such a plea.
Proceeding, De Armond i explained that
later on a motion ; would be -made "'to
amend the Â£ bill to . take the differential
off refined sugarâ the differential- put in
the bill for the benefit of the trust. Then,
he said,- would come the "beautiful Epec
tacle jj we . have witnessed so. oftenâ the
rules would stand in the way and.memr
bers would hide behind the rules."
"I think," -he exclaimed, "that ' the
tariff - should be reformed \ by the friends
of the American people."..-; ~X<'Â£~.ij?. :-.
It was contended,.; said he, on' the other
side, that the tariff' which* had developed
the gigantic trusts should be reformed by
its friends. ' * r< i V
"Fortunatelr,"' . he ; said ironically,
"there - will be opportunity later' oh" for
members to show by their votes that they
have not misrepresented themselves."
HIDING BEHIND RULES.
Speaking of the sugar trust, he observed
that to hear, members, talk 'one would
think there' was ! nothing so friendless- in
the House as this trust. : ' .
Justified their course by an appeal to^
their party principles, he remarked \ that'
viewed from these diverse, standpoints,;
the measure was indeed a' remarkable
departure In .legislation. He commented
upon the statement of General Grosvenbr
a few days - ago that . later the ; high
rates of the Dlngley law would be reduced
and revised by friends of that act If the
rates were too high, he saw. no j reason
why the reduction should not occur now
and in this connection ; ref erred'"sarcas
tically to' the Babcock bill, to place steel
on , the free . list. Its . author, had -voted
against the bill in committee and. he inti
mated broadly that the purpose of its in
troduction was to: hold-up the steel trust
and other kindred trusts for the benefit of
his party in the coming campaign!'. 'Â¦â¢ ..

M. Van Dervelde, the. leader, of the So*
cialist party in Belgium, although an Ad
vocate of the partition of wealth, Is a
millionaire^ He is a lawyer in Brussels,
Is I a doctor Â¦ of laws, . and Us professor of

LEADER A MILLIONAIRE.
M. Van â¢ Dervelde agreed to this and
the Chamber, unanimously fixed the houv
for the - vote; on the' question of a revis
ion of the constitution at 5 o'clock to
morrow afternon.
After a : violent> speech by M. Janson
(Progressionist), who declared the Gov
eminent was forcing the country over the
brink^of i civil- war, the Premier said the
Government. was willing, -'for the sake of
peace, to withdraw the closure . proposal.

remarking: that he d^ecllnea^ to notice such

national instltuitlohV was at ; stake. .The
Government ; p was .responsible for"' the
honor 1 and ' destiny . of 'Â¦ the country and
was ;: conscious of Its duty. He then In
vited the J Chamber, to reject the pro
posed i consideration , of tho proposal to
revise the constitution.
The Negro People's Christian Congress
at Atlanta, Ga., August 6-U, was\then
acted upon. The rate is onÂ© fare and a
third, with a nine-month ticket. The Iron
Molders* Union of North America, In
Canada, July 7-23, is also one fare and a
third, with nine months' time. For the
National Grand Army Encampment at
Washington, D. C, October 6-U. the rate
will be one first-class ticket one way,
with thirty days' time. The Southern Pa
cific and Santa Fe roads will send repre
sentatives to this encampment and en
deavor to bring the next annual reunion
to the coast. The* Old Guard* of New
York will come to this coast in May, 1903.
There will be about 500 lii the party. The
railroad men decided that action on this
matter was premature and it was de
ferred. Military business and Inter
changeable mileage are again on the
docket : for to-morrow.
NEW RATE SCHEDULES.
lAt the meeting to-day a rate was made
to those who wish to attend the "Sum
mer School" at the University of Cali
fornia. They were given a $50 rate from
Chicago, the same rate as to the Shrin
ers' meeting, with the exception that they
are allowed till August 20, while the
Shriners* ticket will expire August 10. The
letter carriers hold a convention at Den
ver September 1-6. . A committee will con
sider a rate and report later to Chairman
Charlton.
The Santa Fe representatives at the
meeting here appear to understand that
there is something in the air. To say
that there is a chilliness arising between
the Southern Pacific representatives and
the Santa Fe men would exaggerate the
matter, but at the same time there id
not the friendliness shown here between
the two roads that there was in the past.
Although both the Southern Pacific ami
Santa Fe roads disclaim that there ever
was an agreement In regard to rates and
the distribution of traffic it is a known
fact that such an agreement was made.
Should the Southern Pacific leave the as
sociation, this agreement would immedi
ately - be dissolved.
HARRIMAN INDEPENDENT.
j President Harriman is a railroad man
who ' is strongly averse to combinations
or pools. He believes that any road that
he 13 connected with is able to take care
-oiritsielffâ Slkifla*- the ; Rock Island - wtJU^
draw : from * the association, It will be
looked upon' by railroad men at this
meeting as the advance" signal for the
Harriman system of roads to follow suit.
Should the Rock Island and Southern Pa
cific come to an agreement they will seri
ously injure the traffic of tho Santa Fe
in Southern California, as at the i-rea
cnt time the Southern Pacific-Reck Isl
and connection makes better time to Chi
cago than the Santa Fe, with the ex
ception of the California limited, which
the latter road runs.

the constitution would not accord - with
the. desires -of the- country. . He did . not

DISCORD 'â¢ IS Â¦ ALLEGED.
Up' to . the present the Boer delegates at
Pretoria have \ acted quite independently
"of . the' Boer reprsentatives In Holland.
As a result of this conference the Boers
practically agreed to accept the. British
terms. I /As ah instance of how matters
are progressing Lord Milner has; sum
moned-to Pretoria from Johannesburg ah
Australian expert to afford^ him Â¦ assist-.
ahce;in estimating the cost of rebuilding
and restocking the. Boer farms, for which
a money grant will be made to the Boers.
.In the â¢ interval, however, their I general
disposition had undergone a change.
They; displayed, according to the Daily
Mail, a more reasonable attitude. Lord
Milner was empowered to grant them one
or two seats on the executive council^
subject to. the approval of his Majesty's
Government, pending restoration of re
sponsible government.
The result of t Tuesday's deliberations
was cabled to the Cabinet, which on
Wednesday reaffirmed the British/posi
tion, refusing to alter any of the terms.
The Boer delegates met again on Thurs
day at Pretoria, when the decision of the
Cabinet was laid before. them, practically
placing them in the. position of agreeing'
to peace on the. British terms or reject
ing them and terminating the conference

Special ; Dispatch^, to The (Call,
Ever since the opening of the meet
ing McCormick and Sebastian have been
in a number of consultations which last
ed for hours. Both railroad men have
been conspicuous by their absence at as
sociation meetings, and have only
dropped into them for a few minutes as
a mere matter of form. For several
weeks there have been rumors to th<? ef
fect that the Rock Island would with
draw from the association, but as yet
no formal communication to this effect
has been received by Chairman Chafl
ton. At the same time It .is generally
conceded that the railroad will do so in
the near future.
From the present outlook every indica
tion points to the fact .that the South
ern Pacific and the Rock Island men are
having a grand love feast, and within a
short time they will come to an agree
ment, whereby they will corner the
â¢freight and passenger traffic in Southern
California.
HOTEL DEL. CORONADO, April 17.â

After the funeral service over the re
mains* of . M. Sipiaguine, which was at
tended'by the Czar, {he Czarina, Grand
Duke Michael (the heir presumptive), the
Grand Dukes' and Grand Duchesses and
the cot| rt diplomats,, the body of the late
'Minister -of '-the' Interior -was interred at
the'Alexander Nowski'Monastery. At the
conclusion' of. the service the coffin was
escorted to -the hearse , by the Czar, the
Grand Duke - Michael', the Grand Dukes
and the -Ministers. . , '
Â¦ Unusually grave Imbor outbreaks are re
ported at YekaterlnoBlav., Poltava. Voro
nej. and Â¦ TamboV. The details, are rigor
ously "suppressed: . '.J''.-
Officials here privately admit that the
murder of Sipiaguine was one of many
exceedingly- alarming symptoms. It was
learned that the chateau of the Duke of
Meeklenburg,, In Southeast Russia, was
recently pillaged and then razed by riot
ers. The young clerk, Orloff, who was
compromised in the revolutionary move
ment and Who hanged himself in prison,
belonged to a group of prisoners who re
fused food and were artificially fed.
Many people think that the death of
Sipiaguine will help the aspirations of M.
de Witte, the Finance Minister, who has
long been ambitious to become Imperial
Chancellor, or at least obtain control of
the Ministry of the Interior.
The death of Sipiaguine may materially
affect the chances of Murry A. Verner,
the millionaire Pittsburg contractor. ' of
securing the St. Petersburg tramway
franchise, as the deceased . was a notable
supporter of Verner's proposition and
overruled the committee which had
recommended the Westinghouse offer.
The "matter possibly is now indefinitely
postponed. '
Shortly before Sipiaguine was appoint-,
ed Minister of the Interior he married the
eldest sister 1 of Count Shermetieff's wife,
a brilliant woman, 26 years of age, who
Is now a warm friend of the Czarina.
Count Shermetieff was deeply Interested
In Lieutenant General Prince Vlasemski.
The latter, who: was a -member of the
Council <of the Empire, was seveneljr. rep
rimanded by -the Czar: for- his protests
against the action of tne police â¢ during

to the Dowager Czarina, who Is largely
under Count Shermetleff's influence. ' .

that under the circumstances it would be

Burleson of Texas asked Underwood It

not now trying to create a defection on

the Datto grandee came to the American
camp and through him General Chaffee
sent a message to the other Dattos, as
suring them of the friendly intentions of

they must deliver up the assassins of the:

the Dattos that the island of Mindanao'

His assassination 1 ," 'easily explicable In the

with joy In radical circles. For a month

of Moscow, the Grand DuKe Sergius, who
has been supporting the novel policy
toward the working classes Instituted by
M. Trepoff, the police prcrect of Moscow,
which includes the organization of labor
unions under police control. The mur
dered. Minister's name was also mixed up
with the stories of financial irregularities
alleged against so many officials at pres

decorating his residence. A single chan-.

Davis added that the Presidente had
been a traitor to the American cause and
that the other natives did not generally
seem to have any sympathy, for him. , Da
vis said he had been in charge of a de
tachment of fifteen men in the town of
Igbaras. for several months, before the
arrival of the regulars, and also for some
time afterwards, and that he had never
had any trouble whatever with the . na
tives. He had talked with the regular sol
diers about the "water-cure" and . had
been given to understand that its adminis
tration 'was not of rare occurrence, but
said they had not given names of persons
or places. Davis replied to Senator Lodge
that.hÂ£ knew of the murder of several of
the members of Company F, of his regi
ment, by natives at another point, but it
had been his understanding that .' they
were killed by ladrones, rather than by
the town authorities, as Colonel Dickman
had reported. â¢
The House Committee on Military : Af
fairs decided to recommend that the reso
lution of Representative Burleson of
Texas, asking for the recent court-mar
tial proceedings in the case of Major Wai*
ler lie on the table. The ground for the
action was that the due forwarding, of the
papers from the Philippines to Washing
ton could not be expedited by any action
of *he House and when" received : the re
ports would be open to inspection and that
the resolution would-be prejudicial to the
parties concerned.
In the Senate the resolutions offered by
Culberson of Texas, directing the Secre
tary of War to send to the Senate a state
ment of money paid by the United' States
on account of the Philippine Commission
and a statement of -the amount of, money
expended for sending 1 troops. to the Philip
pines â¢ and.' for , their maintenance* .were
agreed to. , . : - â¢. ; ; Â¦
"My orders were," he said, "to treat the
natives kindly, and so far as I observed
the soldiers generally so , treated them,
with the exceptions I have mentioned."
The witness also- said that a neighboring
town containing about 12,000 people had
"been burned, but that he did not know
who had given the order for its destruc
tion. .'..-;.
' Davis stated. In reply to questions, that
the torture in all instances mentioned
had been conducted by the regular sol
diers and that they had not been partici
pated in by the members of his regiment,
the Twenty-sixth Volunteers.
Homes of Natives Are Burned.
"There was," he added, "also a native
school teacher there who was maltreated
at the same time, but the water-cure was
not administered to him. He was taken
Into one of the back rooms of the convent
by Dr. Lyon, who secured the information
he wanted from him by placing two Colts
revolvers to his head, thus rendering "it
unnecessary to administer the cure."
. "Did you see this?"
"I did."
Davis also gave the details of the burn
ing of the town of Igbaras, which he said
contained about 10,000 people, but no busi
ness places. All except about . fifteen
bouses were destroyed, and men, women
and children were forced out indiscrimi
nately. ' â¢ â¢ ' Â¦

"To whom did he give it?"
''To Lieutenant Conger. He told the

"I did."
"Did he say why it should be burned?"
"He did not." .
He described the second application of
the cure, as previously testined to, and
corroborated bergeant Riley in the state
ment that the details of this performance
were under the charge of Contract Sur
geon L,yon and that Captain Glenn and
lieutenant Conger * were both present
when it occurred.

physical effect of the process that the
man "squealed" terribly and that his eyes

Officers Direct the Torture.
. WASHINGTON, April- 17.-Edward J.
Davis of Greenfield, Mass., who was a
sergeant in , Company ,: M, Twenty-sixth
Volunteer Infantry, was before the Sen
ate Committee on the Philippines to-day.
He Was present in the -convent at Igba
ras, November 27, 1900, when the ','water
cure" was administered to the Presldente
of the town of Igbaras, as testified to by
Sergeant Riley and /Private Smith, and
'related the incidents connected therewith.
He was sworn before being examined
and was questioned by Senator Kawllna.
He spoke of the arrival of the regulars
under the command of Captain Glenn. He
said that under orders from Captain
Glenn he, with a squad, had taken j the
Presidente into custody on November 27
and had escorted him to the convent,
where the "cure" was administered. He
repeated the story of the torture of the
Presidente, adding some details. .The
man was; he said, about 40 years of age.
When he was taken into the convent ha
was asked to give Information as to
wnether runners had been sent to notify
the insurgents of the arrival of the scouts
in the town. Ketusing to ao tnis, the wa
ter detail, consisting of two privates or
the Klgtueentn lntantry, was ordered by
Captain Ulenn to strip Him. The man s
clothing was removed aoove the waist
and his hands tied behind his back, when
the cure was administered by tnis detail.
"He was then," the witness said, "ta
ken to the water tank and .thrown upon
his back, and while an interpreter stood
over him a stream of water was directed
into his mouth, .which was held open." .
"Who gave tne command tor this treat
ment';"
"captain Glenn." .
; "How was the man's mouth kept open?"
"By means of a stick, but i could not
see just how it was done."
Continuing, the witness said that when
the victim oa the cure was tilled with wa
ter the members of the detail would force
it out of him by rolling their fists over his
stomach, and that the process was kept
up for about ten minutes. . Â¦

TUOLUMNE. April 17.â W. N. Crenshaw
of Indiana, organizer for the - Fraternal
Brotherhood, who is alleged- to have said
all native daughters of California were
loose in morals, and was ridden out of
Nashton. fifteen miles above here, in the
middle of the night, came near meeting a
like. fate here to-night. A mob of about
fifty, men had gathered to ride him out,
but, under the protection of peace officers,
Crenshaw slipped out of the courtroom by
a rear door and hiked over the hills.
Sensational testimony was adduced this
afternoon at the trial of four men, Wil
liam Raymond, J. A. Mullin, James Griffin
and William Sails, for alleged rioting
when Crenshaw was ridden out of Nash
ton. The courtroom was crowded. Cren
shaw was. represented by District Attor
ney Otis and the defendants by J. H. Rog
ers, a local attorney. Crenshaw .denied
that he had said the native daughters
were morally censurable. A special train
from Nashton" brought down Half its in
habitants, â¢ and about twenty-five wit
nesses had been subpenaed.' <
The testimony showed that Crenshaw
had, while at a dance, said if his social
set in San Francisco knew he was dancing
with the girls of Nashton they would os
tracise him;, also that Crenshaw stated
that California girls did not compare with
Eastern girls for virtue; that he could
have married rich California girls in San
Francisco who had a hundred thousand
dollars,' but he would not because all Cali
fornia-born women were "loose.*.*. â¢
The testimony further showed Crenshaw
was taken out of bed at 10. o'clock at
night, put in a cart In his night clothes
and made to retract; his statements. He
admitted he made the statements, but
took them all back and declared he was
only "joshing." He believed the native
daughters were good women. After that
his clothes, were given him and he was
told to dress. Crenshaw then rode over
the rocks out of town and -walked fifteen
miles in the dark over the mountain roads
to Tuolumne. â¢ .."â¢
The prosecutor was unable to make a
single point. Crenshaw "was roundly
scored by the defense and cowered close
to the Constable.
The jury was out four minutes and re
turned a verdict of not guilty. Cheers
sounded and the jurymen were nearly car
ried out of the room by enthusiastic men
and women. Crenshaw, pale and fright
ened, refused to leave the courtroom and
said he feared for his. life. Some one
spoke about going to a store for a rope
and an ominous crowd gathered outside
the court building. . Finally Constable
Heath decided to make a coup, and, close
ly guarding Crenshaw, crept out over the
hills by Â»he back way. The crowd had in
tended to tar and feather the man. -The"
Order Â¦ of the Fraternal Brotherhood will
be asked by the local lodge to investigate
the matter. .;

DR. KILMER & CO., Binghamton. N. Y.
Gentlemenâ While it has never been my habit or Inclination to recommend
remedies the Ingredients of which are not all known to me, it seems as if I
should, make an exception in the case of Dr. Kilmer's : Swamp-Root. My experi-
Â¦ ence, so far as I have tested It in my practice, forces me to the conclusion that it
is a remedy of the greatest value in all kidney, liver, bladder and other inflamma-
tory conditions of the genito-urinary tract. I now take pleasure in prescribing
Swamp-Root in all such cases, with a feeling of assurance that my patients, will j
derive great benefit from its use. I shall continue to prescribe it in other cases in
my practice with the expectation of good results. Very truly yours,

Gentlemenâ I have prescribed that wonderful remedy for kidney complaint. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, with most beneficial effect and know of many cures by its
use. 'i'hese patients had kidney trouble, as diagnosed by other physicians, and
treated without benefit. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root effected a cure. I am a liberal
man and accept a specific wherever I find it. in an accepted school or out of It.
For desperate cases of kidney complaint under treatment with unsatisfactory re-
sults I turn to Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, with most flattering results. I shall
continue to prescribe it. and from personal observations state that Swamp-Root
has great curative properties. Truly Yours,

Rich had been struck by. a train while

SECRETARY ROOT MAXES
PEACE WITH THE SENATE
Relieves General Crozier and Captain
Lewis From Board of Ordnance
and Fortifications.
WASHINGTON, April 17.â Secretary
Root, before leaving for Cuba yesterday,
made an order relieving General Crozier
and Captain I. N. Lewis of the Coast Ar
tillery from further duty with the beard
of ordnance and fortifications. It is un
derstood that this action was taken out
cf deference to the Military Committee
of the Senate. The adverse report of the
committee orÂ» the nomination of General
Crozier as chief of ordnance is salrl to
have been largely due to the complaints
of inventors having business with the
board of ordnance and fortifications. Now
that the department has given heed to
this objection, it is confidently said that
there will be a disposition in the Senate
to meet the department half way and
confirm General Crozier as chief of ord
nance.
Major Charles Shaller of the ordnance
department, who Is stationed at Indian
apolis, succeeds General Crozier .as a
member of the board of , ordnance and
1 f ortiflcatlons, and Captain Harry Taylor
of the engineers, stationed" at Boston,
succeeds Captain Lewis as recorder . of
the board. Captain Lewis has been or
dered to Join, his battery. ..:'<;
No more reckless an attitude was ever
taken with reference to an economic
question or with less benevolence, reason
or Justice, to support it." *Â«=Â«Â«Â»Â«Â«
Morgan maintained that the Isthmian
Canal Commission had no authority to
accept an offer of the Panama Canal
Company and that the sole duty of the
President was to determine the route he
would recommend to Congress.
Referring to the position taken by the
advocates of the Panama route. Morgan
Eaid : .
It is a political situation of great moment
Â¦ nil it Is a cause of sincere gratification to the
three republics concerned In this canal that
their Interests are unified and not discordant
as the interest* of the State of Panama are
toward those of Colombia.
One duty that the Government owes to hu
manity â which rises above all other personal
considerations â In the choice of these routes,
Ik the care of the health and lives of men<
Â¦whose labor is the real power that must open
this great waterway.
6 â If the dam at Bchlo. on the Panama route.
ehould fail from any cause, the only hope of
a canal across that isthmus- would perish,
never to be restored. All engineers admit this
fact. The failure of a dam at Conchuda or i
Boca Ban Carlos or at Ochoa or at Tambcr- :
prur.de or at any other cite en the San Juan
River would only mean the loss of that struc
ture, to k*- jre-plue ed en a better location if a
lake level canal is preferred. -
These chance* are at least 10 to 1, and if
the risk is estimated at only tenfold the cost
of the dam at Bohlo, it would deter the bold
est gambler In futures from risking the pos
sible loss of more than $80,000,000 when. If he
was successful, his . profits could not exceed
$<UÂ«>0,000. But the loss of a dam at Bohlo
could not be less than $144,233,308 clear loss
to the United States in cash, to say nothing
of tie lives wasted in the work, the incalcul
able lose to our commerce and the national
Fhtme and despair that our people would suf
fer.
Discussing the proposed routes of the
canal and the decision of the "Walker
commission, Morgan Bald:
No member of either of the three- commis
sions expressed a doubt or apprehension aa to
the certainty of the successful completion of
a canal on the Nicararuan route on either of
five plans that have been adopted, Eurveyed
end located by the greatest engineers in
America.
The feasibility, practicability, usefulness,
permanence and commercial value of the Pan
ama canal to the United States are all clouded
with many doubts.
Panama Route Carries Risk. '
5 â The assured certainty of success in the
construction of a permanent canal is, of neces
sity, the basic or foundation fact upon which
Congress must act in the selection of the canal
route. Considered as a simple preposition of
civil engineering, there is no doubt â not even
a shadow of doubt â as to any fact touching the
practicability of a ship canal from Greytown to
Brito, in aad along the San Juan River and
across Lake Nicaragua. It is certain, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that its real cost is as nearly
within the limits of exact estimates as any
great public w%rk that was ever undertaken.
It is upon this ascertained and settled basis of
certainty that I rest my Judgment. ~"
The subject presents Itself to ray mind with
conclusive force in the form stated in the six
propositions I will now etaXe:
1 â V.'e have reached the point where lnvesti
ratlon Is complete by observation, experience,
scientific research and forecast, and these
means of knowledge are as conclusive of the
facts as we could hope to make them in an
other half century of delay.
2â The question now to ba decided Is the
choice of either of two routes for a canal,
whether it shall be located at Panama, or
through the valley of the San Juan River, In
Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
3 â The controlling factor In making this se
lection is the assurance of success in construct
ing & canal that will be permanently useful for
commerce and for the needs of the Government
and policies and for the benefit of the people of
the United States. /
4 â A turn of money neceeeary for expenditure
in the work of constructing such a canal to
accomplish euch ends cannot be reasonably
compared with the real value of the results to
the people and the Government of the United
States, and the choice of either route, with
e&fe, intelligent and sincere regard to its per
manent usefulness and advantage, should not
be controlled or affected by a difference In tha
present cost of construction, I will say, within
a limit of even $50,000,000.
Investigation. Is Now Complete.
Morgan argued In favor of the Hepburn
bill, providing for a. Nicaraguan canal. He
assumed in beginning that the Senate
was convinced of the indispensable char
acter of a canal â that it was a national
necessityâ and that it was only a choice
of methods and a comparison of national
advantages which was left to decide "all
questions of financial ability, of private
Interests, of 'political bias, having been
relegated to the rear by command of free,
lionest and powerful people. It Is to
reach the logical results that should fol
low the actual merits of the claim of
either canal route, in deciding the prefer
ence, that I will try to present an outline
of the questions that now require discus
sion."
Continuing, Morgan said:.
WASHINGTON, April 17.â For more
than four hours to-day Morgan of Ala
bama, chairman of the Isthmian Canal
Committee, addressed the Senate on the
subject of the Nicaraguan canal. He de
voted the greater part of his speech to a.
consideration of the desirability and
practicability of the two principal routes.
Nicaragua and Panama. ' He strenuously
favored the former, maintaining that In
every possible respect it had many ad
vantages over the Panama route.

"WASHINGTON, April 17.â The members
of the House who have been chiefly in
terested in the Chinese exclusion, after
formal conferences to-day, decided to ac
cept the Senate substitute adopted yester
day continuing In force the present laws
and applying them to our Insular posses
sions.
Representative Kahn of California, who
introduced the drastic exclusion bill in
the House, and Representative Coombs of
California, who aided in perfecting it,
both expressed the view that the Senate
measure should be accepted as the best
measure obtainable within the few days
remaining before the Geary law expires
by limitation. This view was made kiijwn
to Representative Perkins of New York,
who reported the House exclusion bill
from the Foreign Affairs Committee, and
an informal understanding was' reached
that If the California members were will
ing to accept the Senate substitute this
course undoubtedly would be taken by the
committee and the House. ;
"The Senate substitute as finally
amended, really gives us all we want ex
cept in omitting the sailors' clause," said
Kahn, "and it Is much more drastic than
is generally understood. It goes much fur
ther than the original Platt substitute and
by re-enacting the present law and the ;
law of 1SS8, extending them to our island,
possessions and continuing these laws in
definitely, we get almost if not quite as
much as we did by the original bill. But
In any event, as the present exclusion law
runs out on May 6, It would be desirable
to accept the Senate substitute, for if we
were a single day without an exclusion
law, thousands of Chinamen would cross
the border from Canada.", .
At the conclusion of Morgan's speech
In the Senate to-day. Platt of Connecti
cut called up the Chinese exclusion bill
passed bj' the House. He then moved that
all after the enacting clause, of the bill be
stricken out and that the measure, as
passed by the Senate yesterday, be sub
stituted for it. The motion was carried
Â¦without comment. This action on the
part of the Senate was necessary in or
der to facilitate consideration oÂ£ the meas
ure in the House.

to a dispatch to . the effect that Harry
Corbett of Ban Francisco was trying to
arrange a. match.
"Jeffries has received no word from the

said after the fight: "This man can take
more punishment ' and return it at tha

clean slate until the seventh inning, .when

Oakland Plays Fasi Ball
and - Outclasses the
Local "Wonders.
Dunleavy Sends tho Sphere
Over the Fence for a
- Home Run.
.Mr. J. Cal Ewing's aggregation , of
home-made baseball talent, with! . some
foreign blood mixed through It/ en joyed^
n pleasant afternoon yesterday at the*
Eighth-street lot. [ rr -'j-'.(-xS W. ".Â¦'.
Mr. E wing acted as host, and i Mr. H.
Harris was the guest of honor. He
brought nine young men '.with .him,' while
E wing had a like numberlo keep . the
honored .ones from getting lonesome. Ev
ery one admitted Ewing was a- most un
gracious 'host. He treated his : guests in
a heartless manner, 'cUowing^'; them'. only
two waltzes to the hospitable. plate, while
he reserved eight for his own pets.' "
Schnildt.'who made his debut- In base
ball society last season, was offered . by
Ewing as the chief entertainer; - for "* the
Oakland social lions, .wh t ue;\cute, little
Elmer Meredith wa3; choice.
Schmidt was as wild as the- cowboys of
tho Wild West in tlie 'first half . of the
function, but 'the : \Ponle3- never" .had a
chance to hit any of his curves.' He stead
ied down in - the second half.".: and. -elided
the game in a blaze of glory." .' â¢
Meredith,. Uhotigh at times Â¦ hit hard,
delivered the goous like' a gentlemani, and
tcok his first- defeat with as macltf grace
as the girl graduate takes her'dlpjoma. ..
The Oakland, belles begiin to act tr.ean
at the outset. Meredith, threw a, pretty
little. curve to Walters, who' was unkind
enough â¢ to" -soak It "over .second base.-
Mohler was. not so bad;, he ohiy "sacri
iiced the unjust one .to second. Julia
Streib sent a mean on-j' to. Holly, who did
not want to act selnshly, so he threw
over Nordyke's head, allowing Walters
to make his ' first run on the local dia
mond and letting Streib reach second.
Brick Devereaux- tapped the sphere gen
tly, toward Meredith, who forgot -to put
glue on his hands, so . Streib made the
t>econd tallyl ." .
The suburban tosscrs continued to make
inroads upon the home base. . â¢' They had
different members of the team chasing
around in the third, fourth, fifth, seventh
and eighth innings. In the fourth Dun
leavy put one over the centei field fence
after having two strikes called on him.
Big McCreedie had a *hree-cushion swipe
concealed under his arm, and sprung it
while the fifth was in progress.
The eighth was kind to the Pnnies. Mc-
Hale was given a chance on Franck's er
ror, and Bone bunted safely. Eddie Hol
ly's eye was working well, for he put
a pretty single into short right field, giv
ing McHale and Bone a chance to scam
per home to Uncle. In" all the other in
stances Schmidt was th* big boss. The
Ponies had to accept whatever he chose
to band them, and hi3 collection savored
as much of mystery as one of Nich Car
ter's Weird tales. . â¢
Dunleavy. aside : from hitting: like a
steam hammer, ran bases like a J&ck
rabbit, stealing second and third in a
way which made Ewlngcast side glances
at Harris and say "I guess he's bad."
Little Mohler worked his left wing at
second Just as he used to da Streib'a
work at first was a' revelation. Old
Brick Devereaux had some gingery pack
ages to hand out. while Little Hodson
did his best on the coaching line, look
ing like a bantam rooster anxious for a
fight. Nordyke Injured his leg -in the
first.- - He continued to play until the
fourth, when he retired in favor of Del
mas, Kane going to right field. Score:

Thursday morning Bird was found In

to contain carbolic acid. Dr. Hammond

that Instead of carbolic acid. Bird has
seized a bottle left by a sheep raiser,
containing sheep dip.
* My poor little dead dog cannot come to
me, but I can go to him, and I will do
It. You shall see."
After the burial Bird came to Redding
and drowned the poignancy of his grief
in a epree. Upon sobering up he returned
to Sallee. Wednesday afternoon he
walked into a Delamar store, talked to
the merchant of the loss of his dog and
said:

for which- he bore an unusual affection
bad died, Louis Bird, an English remit
tance man, who has high connections in

month, drank what he thought was car
bolic acid at Sallee this morning, and was
saved from death only by the prompt
work of a physician.
Bird and his dog arrived In Sallee a
year ago. The Englishman, who ap
peared educated and intelligent, became
a clerk, though his remittances relieved
him from the necessity of work unless
he chose to do it. ' Some time ago lie lost

Bird lived at the Miners', Hotel, and for

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 17.â
A complete dramatic success in to-night's
presentation of Sophocles' Greek tragedy,
"Antigone," crowned the efforts of. the
students and the professors who have
been" engaged during the pasts: four
months in its preparation. Superb 'music,
fitting scenery and careful costuming
added to the perfect presentation of the
tragedy," and the large " audience â¢' which
packed the assembly, hall showed \ their
appreciation by repeated applause. 'Â¦
The stage setting, thoroughly Grecian
in style, represented .a space immediately
In front : of the king's palace. On the
.right were the entrances from the city, of
Thebes and on â¢ the left the wings repre
sented a forest adjoining the royal dwell
ing.' At the back of the stage were rep
resented "two immense Grecian doors,
which allowed the ingress of the royal
personages to the scene of the play. As
in all 1 Grecian plays, the scene ln;"Anti
gone" is never changed, and the curtain
does not fall from - the time of the first
appearance of Antigone until the ' final
chorus by Theban elders. To-night's pres
entation was dignified' and without a de
lay of any kind, yet over two hours were,
consumed injhe performance. " ; .
â¢,In a petition filed to-day, William Hol
lenbeck, Mabel Gordon and Louise Krah
enberg charged him with misappropriating
$6511 from the estate. Peers has been ad
ministrator of the Â¦ estate . since 1881. ; At
that time trie 'estate was; appraised - at
$30,000. The legatees allege that only two
accounts with the estate have been filed
since that time, one. in 1888 and - another
in 1894, until several .days ago, when the
third, account was ' presented to the court.
This showed that the estate had shrunk
to $9Q78, a notable decrease from the first
valuation. â¢ . â¢
The heirs accuse the executor of mak

against the estate, and also of continually
juggling the accounts, and claim* that he
has run the esate to his own interests
rather, than to the interests of the heirs.

TUOLUMNE. April 17.â While sawinjr a
log in the woods, nearly a score of miles
from this place, H. Harvey, a former
resident of Rushville, Â¦ Iowa, received a
fatal injury yesterday. A fellow work
man was driving a steel wedge, when a
splinter of metal broke from It and sev
ered Harvey's Jugular vein.
The Injured man would have bled to
death in a few minutes, but his com
panion, with heroic solicitude, seized one
end of the divided vein, and pressing the
edges tightly between finger and thumb,
prevented a further escape of blood.
The place .where the accident occurred
was far out In the woods and medical at
tendance was not to be obtained at any
place nearer than Tuolumne. The men
Immediately resolved to attempt the long
Journey, and accompanied by another la
borer, they started. Harvey's comrade
walked at his side, hold firmly the sev
ered vein, while the third man supported
the injured sawyer. â¢
When the party had traversed a few
miles blood began to * flow from the
vein, for the hands of the man who held
it had becomexiumb under tha . strain.
Then the\ laborer who had helped Har
vey along undertook to stay the flow. By
alternating in this severe task every mile
or two, Harvey's friends managed to
bring him here. An operation was imme
diately performed, but It was too' late.
Harvey died soon after his arrival.
ENGINEER HURT
IN EXPLOSION
Hiram Pope Is Fatally
Burned at Point
Richmond.
, POINT RICHMOND, April 17.â By thÂ»
explosion of an oil burner at 10:30 o'clock
to-night at the Santa Fe pumping sta
tion Hiram Pope, the engineer, was blown
out of the flreroom and fatally burned.
The pumping plant was damaged to the
extent of $5000.
Shortly before the accident Pope had
gene out of the engine room to throw a
switch for a train. He returned to at
tend to the fire. When the explosion oc
curred he was standing directly in front
of the boilers. It is supposed that during
Pope's absence the flame was accidentally
extinguished, that gas accumulated In the
furnace and was- exploded when the en
gineer again ignited the oil.
The names' attracted John Bayliss and
R. Chevosich, railroad workmen, who, at
considerable . peril to themselves, went
into the pump house and dragged Pope
out,' his clothing all ablaze. He was
terribly burned about the body.
Such temporary relief as was at hand
was given the injured man and he was
taken on a special tugboat to the Rail
road Hospital at San Francisco. Pope is
about CO years of age. His family resides

\^J tions for Â¦ the second presentation
\-*~*^ : of "The Chaperon", to-morrow

the . school. The production of thi3
merry comedy /promises to . be one of
the most memorable events in the history
of the Girls' High School. ; It has been
given once, and on that occasion the tal
ented young ladles scored such a success
that: it'. '-was. decided -that 'the play should
be repeated..' . , r '
"The Cha'peron" is to be presented for
the benefit of the teachers' annuity fund.
j? or some time past the | winsome y.oung
students have been under the Instruction
of L. 'Dupont Syle and a number of them
have displayed all the ; talent and grace
of comic opera queens.'
During the intermissions of the opera
the Girls' High School Orchestf a, which
has already acquired an enviable reputa
tion, will render selections. The mem
bers of this famed orchestra are all mu
sicians of the first rank and there is a
great desire to hear them. In the second
act a quaint minuet will be introduced.
"The Chaperon," with its ludicrous sit
uations and climaxes, affords an excellent
opportunity f or v the young ladles to dis
play their 'histrionic talents.' â¢--* â¢'-- w
'.'The Chaperon", was especially written
for young girls. by Rachel E. Baker. The
young ladies who will take part In the
play and those who will render the musi
cal selections are: ,

losing. He continues to wear a field marshal's uni

For the purpose, of keeping, pace with other na
tions, the 'Russian Government has found it neces
sary to educate, her. people so' as to fit them to com
pete with Britain, Germany and the United States in
war and in peace. .The effort has been to . provide
education in such a .way that the student would be'a
better tool of despotism than when uneducated. The
result has been disappointing to 7 the ; . Government.
The; students .have , acquired ideas of intellectual
freedom as well as ; skill' in military and 'industrial
arts, and . accordingly they are now more likely to
overthrow despotism than to "sustain it.
, â¢ These' struggles have/now reached a point where
no compromise is possible. Though the : full extent
of them is carefully. hidden by the secret societies of
the students on the one: side and' the Government
censorship on the other, it seems evident that they
constitute by. far the most serious feature of Russian
development at this time. It is quite probable, in

That is the response that f comes -t9 the leaders of
the .Cuban relief scheme. ' Tneir efforts to belittle
stalwart protectionist's have no other effect than that
of stimulating free-traders' to 'another wholesale at
tack upon the tariff. If once more the industries of
the country are to be rendered uncertain by- a.free
trade agitation a prolonged political controversy
the people will know just where' the blame liea.
A short time ago the Washington correspondent
of the Boston Herald wrote â¢ to his paper: "The*
need of a strong opposition in the House. of Repre
sentatives is especially felt, now that the. Cuban re
lief bill, is under consideration. ' The Democratic
party is divided on the measure, as was indicated by
the Vcte on the question of consideration.--* * 'â¢Â¦*'
There art six Democrats from the State of Louisi
ana, twe from Texas, two from Florida and several
other; here, and there who are voting on this'ques
tion as they voted on the Philippine tariff bill and
on the war revenue measure, precisely as if they were
Republicans. - * * * Â¦ Nevertheless, there is a
movement here which is probably a reflection of one
that is occurring in the country, at large, in favor of
basing the coming Congressional campaign mainly
on tKe' tariff issue. L"ower" duties along the whole
line'and'fr'ce trade for the colonies is the issue. which
finds favor with leading" Democrats; throughout the
country, and some of the Democrats in Congress."
The free-traders perceive the opportunity to make
an assault upon the whole protective system, and
were it not for the divided and demoralized condi
tion of the Democratic party, upon which the free
traders must rely to make their fight, the whole
countr> would even now be ringing with a loud de
mand for tariff revision in' the direction of free trade.
American protectionists dp not look upon any par
ticular tariff with superstitious reverence. To use
the words of McKinley, "without being insistent
upon particular schedules, they arc devoted to Â¦ the
doctrine of protection to all American industries.'-'
No man is making a fetish of the Dingley ; any
more than of the McKinley tariff. The charge made
against the Cuban reciprocity boomers is not that
they are weakening the Dingley tariff, but that they
are assailing the principle of protection itself.
Meddling with the sugar and tobacco tariff has,
in fact, led to muddling the whole issue. The men
who are responsible for the situation have made
matters worse and worse with every attempt to jus
tify their course. They have gone so far as to at
tempt to evade their critics by charging them with
imbecility. Thus Representative Payne recently
stated that the Republican opponents of the Cuban
scheme "seem to think that there is something so
sacred in every line cf the Dingley bill that you
cannot alter a word cf it without becoming a free
trader." Representative Grosvenor has followed the
example of Payne, and with an assumption of lofty
superiority has declared that he "does not look upon
the tariff system as a fetish j which is not to be
touched or examined." Men of lesser note among
the Cuban schemers are quoted as having uttered
similar sneers at genuine protectionists, and accord
ingly a report has gone out from Washington that
something like general revision of the tariff may be
looked for in the near future.
WHEN certain Republican leaders in Con
gress broached the plan of reducing cus
toms duties on tobacco and sugar for the
alleged purpose of promoting the prosperity of Cuba
they were warned that their policy would lead them
to surrender protection as a principle and make of it
a mere matter of expediency, to be subjected to
Congressional log-rolling and to the compromises
resulting from the conflict of adverse interests. That
warning has been fulfilled. In their efforts to defend
tneir policy the supporters of the Cuban reciprocity
scheme have gone so far as to hold out a promise of
general tariff revision, and the free-traders have been
keen and quick to make note of it.

any one undertake's to recall the issues upon which

utmost he would say was: "It is the part of wisdom

Large as are these" losses by the parties directly
concerned in strikes and lockouts, t it is safe to say
the loss to the communities where they took place
were larger still. If, for example, there should be a
strike on the street car lines of this city that would
deprive the people of the car service thousands of
men and women would be unable to get to their
places of employment on time, all kinds of industry
would suffer and business would be heavily handi
capped. It is to be hoped, then, that the leaders of
both sides of the present controversy will bear in
mind their responsibility to the community v ,at ' this
juncture and refrain from any inconsiderate action.
'The loss to employes in the establishments/.; in
which strikes occurred for the period of twenty years.
was $257,863,478. The loss to employes through
lockouts during the same period was $48,819,745, or
a total loss to employes by reason of these two
classes of industrial disturbances of $303,683,223.
The number of establishments involved in strikes
during this period was 117,509, making an average!
loss of $2194 to employes in each . establishment', in J
which strikes occurred. The number of 'persons
thrown out of employment by strikes ; was 6;io5,6Q4,
making an average loss pf $42 to each .person* â¢ in
volved. * * * The loss to employers-- through'
strikes during the twenty years amouhtedUo'$i22,
731,121, their losses through, lockouts amounted to
$19,927,083, making a total loss to establishments or
firms involved in strikes or lockouts during this
period of $142,659,104, or an average loss of $1119
to each firm or establishment involved."
The recently published report of the^ United States
Commissioner of Labor shows how heavy are the
losses Entailed upon the employes and the owners of
industries involved in strikes, but no showing is
made of the losses to the communities .where: the
strikes -occur. Even the partial showing of losses,
however, reveals enough to prove that strikes and
lockouts should not be resorted to except in extreme
cases. The report, which covers the period from
January i, i88r, to December 31, 1500, says:
It is important to note in this connection that
those who will suffer most by any interruption of the
street car service will be the working people. -The
mass of wage-earners do not live downtown, but in
the suburbs. Their homes are remote from the cen
ters of industry. They depend upon the street car
service more than any other .class of people. They
cannot afford cabs. They cannot afford the time
for the long walk from their homes to the' shops and
factories where they are employed. In fact, a sus
pension of the car service would be a monstrous
wrong to working men and working women. Â¦ â¢â¢Â¦';
At the present time the street car lines are under
temporary management. The. roads â¢. .have been re
cently purchased by an Eastern syndicate, ; and the
new" administration lias not been organized: The
men now in control have no authority. . to ,. make
terms for the new owners, and their own tenure is
of too brief duration to make it worth while for
them to act upon their own responsibility. Under
such circumstances it is clearly the right of -the
public to ask of the employes not ' to -precipitate a
strike which will tie up the roads at this juncture.
San Francisco has been built up on a street railway
system. A very large proportion of her people have
'established homes remote from their places of busi
ness on the understanding that there would be ample
street car accommodation to carry them to and fro.
If now the cars be stopped those people will suffer
something more than inconvenience. Their .losses
will be heavy and in many instances serious hardr
ships will result. . ."'.. Â¦ . C ;' ;: -,'
UPON the merits of the controversy between
the employes -and the "officials of the
United Railways the public cannot pass judg
ment.- Not until all the facts are known with all the
qualifying circumstances can it be determined with
justice how far either side has the right to carry the
conflict to a point which will result in depriving the
people for an indefinite time. of the use of one of the
most important public utilities. Upon the question
of expediency, however, the public has a right to
speak even without knowing the facts, for the regu
lar running of the street cars is a matter of serious
concern to thousands - of people, and each and all of
them have a right to urge upon the leaders of both
sides that there be no interference with the car ser
vice until every other means of settling. their differ
ences has been exhausted. :
Publishers' promises for. the immediata
future are neither numerous nor import
ant. It is becoming more and more ap
parent that there is a fear that the ; cor
onation season will cause the book trade
to be slack till the autumn. The conse
quence is that authors are finding It more
than usually difficult to dispose of their
books, most houses having their lists full
for the remainder of the year. --Many
books have been acquired that will not
see the light till the spring of 1903.

itself as to who will write the official

Rhodes has left papers having half the
human Interest of his will, his biography
will be a unique book."

SUPREME COURT
OF FORESTERS
MRS. CALEGARIS I
GETS DIVORCE
While there were incidental matters con
tained in the original order that I felt ought
to have gone into force, nevertheless j I um
much gratified that some Immediate results
are in sight and will soon be realized and that
the authority and control of the commission
is definitely reco2"3ized-
The disposition of the commission has been
fair but firm throughout and the result of thÂ»
proceeding Is, In my opinion, very credltabi"
to the gentleman representing the railroad
companies who brought it about.
W. A. Bissell. representing both companies â
the Southern Pacific and the Atchlson. Tcjieka
and Santa Feâ took up the matter and shewed
a very fair and commendable disposition
toward coming to an understanding, and I feel
that It is a matter of congratulation that a
settlement has been reached and some results
obtained.
Under the existing conditions of the oil In
dustry the net returns per" car will be in
creased from 20 to 25 per cent, so that while
the reduction is not large, it will . prove of
great benefit to the industry during the present
period of excessively low prices.
Net- Beturns â¢ Increased.^ â¢
The present shipments, made where the rate
is applicable, amount to about 2000 cars per
month, so that the monthly reduction will be
about 113.000 or 1180,000 per year.
The reduction in the switching charg
amounts to an average of SI per car and
makes the aggregate reduction practically 5
cents per barrel or $7 50 per car.
This last rate applied to San Francisco ami
all adjacent itoints covered about 90 per cent
of all shipments north of Tehachapl.
The present rate, which is agreed to be pu 1 .
in force within twenty days, gives the same
rate to San Francisco and adjacent points, to
wit. 37.8 cents, a reduction of 4.2 cents per
barrel. - -
On the rehearing the rat<i was made so that
for the first luO miles the rate per barrel was
25 cents: for the next 100 miles or under 200
It was about 31 cents: for over 200 miles and
not exceeding 375 miles it was about 31.S
cents.
By the original order the rates .were reduced
from 42 cents to 37.8 cents per barrel to San
Francisco and adjacent points and the switch
ing chare^a were taken under- consideration
and advisement.
Mr. Short said after the adjournment:
Frank H. Short, who appeared on be
half of the Commissioners, informed
Judge Morrow that a similar agreement
would be made with regard to the other
cases, and the cases were therefore con
tinued for the term. â¢ Â¦
Immediately upon the adjournment of
the Commissioners' meeting:, C. M. Sterry
of counsel for the Atchlson, Topeka and
Santa Fe moved In the United States
Circuit Court that the restraining order
heretofore served on the Railroad Com
missioners be dissolved and that the order
to show cause be discharged, so far as

The Gage plan of campaign, so far as
It relates to the Democratic end of the
Republican machine, is fully mapped out.
The Buckley Democratic push will vote
for Republican delegates and of course
vote the machine ticket. At the last elec
tion in this city 5000 Democrats voted for
delegates to the Republican Municipal
Convention, and gave Herrin and Burns
1 the control of the Republican works. An
attempt will be made to play the same
game in the j election of delegates from
San Francisco to the Republican State
Convention. ; But Burns, Herrin and
Buckley will require more than 5000
Democratic votes to swing San Francisco
into line for Gage. A convention created
in a large measure by Democratic influ
ences cannot nominate a genulrtÂ© Repub
lican ticket. Indications are that the stal
wart Republicans of the city will) vote so
overwhelmingly against the Gage tickets
lflv the several Assembly districts of the
city that the .push elements of both par
ties will be defeated. The bosses, by the
rawest kind of work, nominated Wells
and went down to utter defeat. â¢' Every
politician who Is > gifted with a grain of
common sense ought to know the fate in
reserve for Gage, In the event of his
I forced nomination.- - ; .Â»...,.
Gage Plan, of Campaign.
At the recent gathering of Democratic
spellbinders in San Francisco to ceie
brate the birthday of Thomas Jefferson
the Hearst programme was disclosed t(5
several leaders of the party. The plan
is to boom Geary and hammer J. C.
Sims, chairman of the party's State Cen
tral Committee. The followers of Hearst
entertain the notion that the best way
to help Geary Is to exclude Sims from
the camp.
The story goes that an effort was re
cently made to line up Coogan of Hum
boldt for Geary, and that high words en
livened the â¢ unsuccessful effort to pro
gramme the chairman of the Humboldt
County Democratic Committee.
Hammer Is Out for Sims.
As the political game now stands Tom
Geary Is Hearst's Democratic candidate
for Governor. This much was suspected
when Geary was . called to the chairman
ship of the Chinese exclusion convention
at Metropolitan Temple. That conven
tion was called for. the purpose of re
invlgoratlng the weak' and weary Demo
cratic politicians of this State. Geary
was made the figurehead in order to give
him prestige with the exclusionlsts. He
followed the programme, given to -him
by Hearst's San Francisco paper, and
winked at the exclusion of Â»am snort
ridge from the list of orators. Congiessr
man Needham's letter to the convention
was edited to suit the fancy of Demo
cratic politicians' before it was read to
the convention, and E. B. Edson's letter
was entirely overlooked or suppressed.
Four Democratic politicians were put on
a, committee to represent the convention
at Washington, and Governor Gage, ever
ready to help Democrats when he can
help himself, 'attached the great seal of
the State to the commission, authoriz
ing Phelan,\ Budd, Llvernash and Furu
setti to represent California at, the com
mittee sessions - of Congress. The let
ter-writing Governor did not pause to
reflect that California was amply and
ably represented in Congress by seven
Republican Representatives and "two Re
publican Seven of the nine
were chosen by a direct vote of the peo
ple. , -
, City Engineer Grunsky spoke in favor
of the plan to lower the grade of San
some street, east of Telegraph. Hill, in or
der to permit traffic between the business
district and the wharves. Grunsky sug
gested the assessment district plan and
6aid it would cost $319,000, of which $200,900
would be for claims for damages to prop
erty. Supervisor Curtis thought the mat
ter should be submitted to a vote of the
people.
The committee postponed action for one
week, when representatives of the Mer
chants* Association, the Xorth Central
Improvement Association "and the Dray
men's Association will present their views.
The clerk was directed to ascertain If
the Spring Valley Water Company will
grant a right of way over its Lobos Creek
property for the proposed northerly exten
sion of Golden Gate Park to the Presidio.
The committee reported in favor of di
recting the Board of Works to instruct
the City Architect to prepare plans for a
new City Hospital in conformity with sug
gestions to be made by Supervisor d'An
cona and a committee of physicians.
"Would Lower Sansoxne Street.
School Directors Roncovieri, Denman
and Mark reported that of the eighteen
new ischoolhouses they desired to be in
corporated- in the bond Issue, sites for
ten are owned by the city and therefore
eight new sites would have to be pur
chased. The Board of Education was
granted further time to continue its in
vestigations of proper sites.
At the request of the Public Library
Trustees, the committee recommended
the transfer of the school lot on Sixteenth
street, near Noe, as a site for branch
llbary No. 7. The donation of $25,000,
made by Andrew B. McCreery, will be
utilized to erect a building thereon.
Beport on Schoolhouse Sites.
The Public Utilities Committee of the
Board of Supervisors met yasterday and
considered the advisability of temporarily
postponing- the preliminary proceedings
looking to the acquisition of Â¦ the Geary
Â»treet road by the municipality. The City
Attorney's opinion, declaring that the
franchise of the road, named does not ex
pire until November 6, 1903* was Â¦ read. A
number of other quixries regarding the
proper method of procedure In securing
municipal ownership of the road have yet
to be answered by the City Attopney.
Supervisor d'Ancona urged wit Imme
diate steps be taken, to take over the
road, notwithstanding the City Attorney's
opinion, which he said should be verified.
It was explained that the opinion was
rendered only after an exhaustive inves
tigation of the records I of the Board of
Supervisors had been made. â¢ -
Chairman Bra.unhart moved that tne
owners of the Geary-street road be sum
moned to turn the road over to the city.
His motion, however, -was not considered
seriously and it failed to receive a second.
Mayor Schmitz, who is credited with hav
ing said that he thought a demand should
be made on the company to surrender Its
franchise, was sent for, but failed to re
spond. A communication was ordered
sent to the Mayor, asklagr his advice as
to any plain which might result in earlier
municipal ownership of fhe road. '. '
The committee finally approved the
opinion of the City Attorney that the
franchise expires in 1903. It decided to
await the answers to the other queries
put to the City Attorney, bat agreed to
make provision In . the cext bond issue
for the acquisition of the rood by the

of ''pig: In the hole," which he termed
"Irish golf." "An old tin â¢ can was used

Schmitz and the Board^ of Supervisors
yesterday requesting that he, be allowed
thirty field deputies during May and Juno.
Doage says that this necessity arises
from two cause*â first, the appropriation
for thi* Gffice'is insufficient' to. enable the
Assessor to properly discharge his duties,
and, secondly, as a result of the fact that
a considerable sum has been expended
this year out of the appropriation in re
vising the assessed valuations of prop
erty, thus leaving less funds available for
the completion of the necessary field
work connected with the collection of
personal property taxes. , - . .
Dodge further says that owing to" in
sufficient clerical help only $140,000 In per
sonal property taxes has been collected
though $625,000 was collected last yeaf
prior to July 1. Only $1600 is available for

FROM THEIR DWELLING
A brisk fire occurred last night at 1241

a result two families 'who occupied a one
story frame house at that number were
completely burned out. The families are
those of P. J. Sheahan and W. J. Gordon.
The origin of the fire could not be ascer

when the blaze commenced and the mem
bers were forced from the burning struc
ture clad only in night clothes. They
were, however, provided with shelter and
clothing by kind neighbors:
When the fire engines reached the burn
ing structure the flames had gained puch
headway that nothing could be done to
check them. The building -was composed
of wood end was burned to the ground.
The loss, including that sustained by the
families, will not exceed $2000.

any fidelity company "may be accepted
by the court as security." but the Spanian
translation of this order according to
Spanish ' scholars requires that a bond
"must be accepted" from any such com

Santa Fe Railway Company Ready to
Help Out in Much-Needed
Improvement.
A. H. Payson, vice president of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway
eystem, notified the Board of Supervisors
yesterday that the company will pay half
tue cost cf constructing a drawbridge
across Channel street at the foot of
Third.
Mr. Payson says in his communication
that the progress of the work for the
improvement of China Basin makes it
probable, that Kentucky street, between
Channel .and Fourth streets*, will have
been graded before July, 1903. He re
quests that an appropriation be made
now for the drawbridge if it is to be avail
able for use when the street is ready.
The Board of Works in its estimate of
expenditures for the next fiscal year re
quested the Supervisors to appropriate
$50,000 for the drawbridge, but as the com
pany desires to stand half the cost, the
request will be modified so that but
525,000 will be paid by the city.

WHAT HE CALLS A JOB
The cases of the one hundred and fif

sents the defendants, was aroused wh'eh*
the case of Gustav Mahoney. "one of the"
men arrested, was called, and Attorney.
Byers answered that he would waive a
Jury and was ready to proceed.
"Is this the only complaint sworn to?"
asked Ach, and when answered in the
affirmative he moved that all the oth^r
defendants be discharged. The Judge
sent for Captain Spillane, who said that
the other 114 complaints were being pre
pared and would be ready in a few min
utes.
"This is a contemptible, dirty job on
the part of some one," said Ach, angrily.
"I appeared for all the defendants and
BOW one is singled out, another attorney
appears for him and waives a jury and is
ready for trial. There is a job on some
body's part, and I would like to know
what it all means. It looks like an at

clients."
Attorney Byers disclaimed any knowl
edge of a job. He had been retained by
Mahoney to represent him and that was
all he knew about it.
In a few minutes the other 114 com
plaints were brought into court and Cap

Â¦aid it would take him some time to sign

to-day when mandamus proceedings were

ask that the order of Secretary Hitchcock
rejecting the land selections made by C.
W. Clark be recalled or vacated or that
the cancellation of these selections be re
called and vacated, thÂ© regular proceed
ings reinstated and the selections passed
to patent. The complainants dispute the
power of the Secretary, to make his regu

his authority-to require a non-occupancy
affidavit as a precedent condition to the
vesting of the selectors' title. They as
sert that the requirement is 'not essential
and that they have done everything called

PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH
â¢ A PERFUMERY FACTORY
European Capitalists Send Agent to
Inspect Floral Resources of
This State.
Parties in Europe have become inter
ested in a scheme to establish a per
fumery factory in this vicinity or at some
point north of Tehachapi, near a section
where flowers can be. raised in large
quantities to be sold to the factory. J.
Jacobs of Tacoma. who has recently re
turned from Europe, where he talked
over the project with moneyed men, is in
this city, stopping at a downtown hotel.
He came here to get all the information
possible, and yesterday called upon Man
ager Fllcher of the State Board of Trade
for facts. Mr. Jacobs said that there js
no lack of capital that can be enlisted
upon the proper showing.
Jacobs is of the opinion that there
are many farmers who would gladly
raise the flowers that are wanted for an
agreed price. The average income from
an acre of flowers in Europe runs from
$75 to $100 per acre for roses, and other
flowers pay well. It is necessary that at
least 1000 acres | of orange orchard shall
be not more than fifty miles distant from
the perfumery factory. Orange blossoms,
so Sir. Jacobs thinks, could- be trans
ported fifty miles without being Injured
for use in making perfumery. The flowers
needed most are roses, lilacs, carnations
and violets.
Mr. Jacobs will visit the Santa Clara
Valley first and then will go through the
San Joaquin and Sacramento and perhaps
other valleys in search of the ideal spot
in which "to locate the perfumery estaD-

Appeal' Is Made to Americans for
Sympathy in Struggle Against
, ;' - : .Coercion:.
April 17-^In the House of
Commons to-day r J6rin Redmond, the
Irish . Nationalist : leadef, speaking of the
crimes'' act proclamation' Issued last night
by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Earl
Cadogan, declared that an infamous con
spiracy was on foot v in England to fo
ment crime .in Ireland where none ex
isted. The stories of outrage and vio
lence in Ireland were infamous calumnies.
The Nationalists in Ireland were only
governed by a contemptible minority.
This statement was cheered by the Irish
members. A hundred men, . continued
Redmond,- stood ready to replace every
man sent to prison in Mils struggle. The
Irish entreated Wyndham, the Chief Sec
retary for Ireland, to change his policy;
but if he continued it 'they .would meet
him face to face and give blow for blow.
Their answer to his coercion of 1 - Ireland
would Â¦ be - Â¦ to harden their I hearts,
strengthen their organization and compel
redress. 'â¢
Wyndham replied that while It was true
that there was a comparative absence in
Ireland of crime against the person the
lives of people were made miserable by
intimidation and boycotting. The Gov
ernment was not acting from political mo
tives, but as the result of a mass of infor
mation laboriously collected and carefully
examined.- A motion for adjournment to
discuss coercion I made by Redmond was
rejected by a vote of 253 to 148. John Red
mond and John Dillon have sent a joint
cablegram to former Congressman John
F. Finerty of Â¦ Chicago, . appealing for
American sympathy and support during
the struggle against - coercion.

EL PASO, Tex., April 17.â William
Weisenberger, a former New York pawn
broker, was arrested at the border to
day on the charge of smuggling. Watches,
diamonds and other jewels valued at $2000
found concealed on his person were seized.
Weisenberger was returning to the

no attempt to smuggle the goods into the
United States but "cleared" them to the
officers. He is being held for trial.
The inspectors found most of the valu
ables concealed in a money belt which the
prisoner was wearing. They claim to
have a strong case against the defendant.
Weisenberger was tried in New York on
the charge of receiving stolen property
pawned with him by a burglar.
Pat Garret, the cowboy collector of cus
toms, declares the capture is one of the
most Important ever made. It 13 sup

The forty-fourth annual conclave of the
Grand Commadery of the Knights Tem
plar of California opened yesterday morn
ing In the Masonic Temple, .with Grand
Commander George B. McKee in the pre
siding officer's chair. The preliminary,
service at the opening Is one of the most
beautiful of the various branches of the
higher work of Masonry. There" was
an organ prelude, after which all the Sir
Knights, in full dreBs uniform except the
doublet, arose and sang a hymn written
for the conclave, after which the grand
commander ordered the Sir Knights to
their devotions, when the grand prelate
offered a prayer.
Then followed the chanting of the
Lord's prayer by the Temple choir, after
which the choir sang "God Is Our Hope
and Strength." Then there was given the
lesson from the Evangelist, the ' Sir
Knights kneeling during the reading.
This was followed by a prayer by the
grand prelate. The Doxology closed that
part of the ceremonies.
All the grand officers were present,- and
after the preliminary business the reports
of the grand officers were presented. In
his report the grand commander calls at
tention to the fact that at the triennial
-convention in Louisville last year he pre
sented the request of many Sir Knights
of California that the next gTand en
campment be held In San Francisco, and
that it was decided that it should be so
held, commencing on the first Tuesday in
September, 1904. He also called attention
to the fact that the room set apart as an
office for the grand recorder is totally
inadequate to the needs of the frater
nity.
Considerable time of the session was
taken up in the discussion of the work
to be done in the matter of the reception
and entertainment of those who shall be
representatives to the grand encampment
In 1904, and those who will acompany
them.
During the afternoon R. H. Lloyd, who
recently retired from the office of grand
master at the expiration of his three
year term, was presented with a diamond
set gold cross of his rank, voted him at
the grand encampment at Louisville. The
cross cost the sum of $1000.
The preliminary work done by the com
mittee to arrange a plan of action for the
reception and entertainment during the
twenty-ninth triennial conclave was con
sidered and adopted. Further action in
relation to this matter will be taken at
the session to-day.
In the evening Golden Gate Command
ery No. 16 conferred the Templar degree
in the presence of the members of the
grand commandery. and to-night Califor
nia Commandery No. 1' will confer the
Red Cross degree.
Officers for the ensuing term will be
chosen this morning.

The transport Sherman did not pass out of
the harbor until 10 o'clock yesterday morning.
The Thetis had just come off the dry
dock. She has undergone an extensive
overhauling and was almost ready to
start on her northern cruise. She was
going to Howard-street wharf for coal.
She came down on a strong ebb tide and
had considerable headway on her own
account when the smashup occurred. The
intention of the navigator was to run the
cutter alongside the dock. The tide and
defective steering .apparatus conspired to
frustrate this design. Instead of gliding
gracefully into her berth the Thetis
struck the dock head on. She poked her
bowsprit through the shed and ripped a
big hole in the wharf. The Thetis was
constructed to break ice and the wooden
pier was like so much paper under her
hardwood snout. She was backed into
the stream and steamed her way to Oak
land Creek, where repairs will be effected.
The damage done to the pier has not been
estimated exactly, but will be over $1000.
The cutter lost her bowsprit and figure
head, had her bow crushed and strained
and lost her fore top-gallant mast, which
toppled down when she hit the wharf.
THE United States â¢ revenue cutter
Thetis crashed into Howard
street wharf yesterday morning,
knocked about $1000 worth of
State property into' smithereens,

a close imitation of the French bark Max
after her collision with the Walla Walla.

Even when Judge Sloss hands down his
decision the fight for the office will by no
means be settled. The present actior
is merely brought by McComb to force
Fredrick to give up the records of the
Clerk's office. Should the court decide
that McComb is entitled to the docu
ments there would be nothing to prevent
Fredrick from opening up a "branch
office," such as is now conducted by Mc-
Comb, and thus continuing the present
ridiculous and confusing situation. After
the present "summary proceeding Is set
tled the case will then come up for trial
on its real merits, and it will then be
decided who is the de jure officer. Judge
Sloss will announce his decision next
week.
Samuels Makes Argnment.
Attorney Samuels devoted the time al
lowed him for answer to prove the Mayo
has not an unlimited veto power over all
the bills and resolutions passed by the Su
pervisors. He read provisions from the
charter granting powers to the Super
visors, contending that it was most ab
surd that the Mayor should have author
ity to prohibit the exercise of these pow
ers by the use of his veto. For instance
he said that the charter allowed the Su
pervisors to call upon the Board of Pub
lic Works for information, and declared
that it would be worse than foolish to
argue that the Mayor had the right to
forbid them to do so.
If the Justices have not the power to
appoint a Chief Clerk the office still re
mains and the Mayor, under his right
to fill vacancies, has the right to make
the appointment.
The consolidation act was superseded
by the charter, and Its provisions relat
ing to the election of a Clerk by the Jus
tices is supplanted by the present or
ganic law of the city.
Fredrick is the de facto officer right
fully in possession under an appointment
by the Mayor to fill the vacancy caused
by the suspension and resignation of "Wil
liams. The charter of the city provides
that the Mayor shall fill vacancies.
He cannot maintain this proceeding, as
it involves a determination of title, and
his title is on its face not free from sub
.^tiintial ,doubt_ This imperfection of his
title was caused by the Mayor's veto
end the- failure on his part to file the
requisite bond.
McComb cannot recover, under the law,
by proving a weakness in Fredrick's
title.
McComb has no legal title to the of
riee, first, because or the Mayor's veto
of his appointment, and, trecond. because
of his failure to file a bond as required
by the State law and the charter.
He is not the actual incumbent, be
cause he has not a complete legal title
lor the reasons stated above.
In submitting his case to the court. At
torney Ruef summed up his points as
follows:
Ruef Sums Up Case.
When the court convened in the morn
ing Attorney Ruef proceeded with his
presentation of Fredrick's case, advanc
ing the same line of argument as on the
preceding day. His time was devoted to
proving that the Mayor had ample right
to veto the resolution of the Supervisors
conferring on McComb the Chief Clerk's
iranchise, and also proving that under
the conditions then existing Mayor
Sohmitz had the right to appoint Fred
rick. Attorney Ruef made, a very strung
argument, ana fortified ail his points by
quoting precedents.
He contended that even if the Justices
had net the necessary pawcr to elect a
Chief Clerk, and even if there is no
jTovisIon m the charter rer,-arding the
rilling of a vacancy in that position, the
ottiee "itself is not necessarily abolished.
He declared that it was evident that if
there was no stipulation In the charter
as vo how the omce should be filled the
ijower of appointment rested with the
Mayor. On this point the charter pro
vides that all vacancies not otherwise
provided for shall be filled by the
Mayor.
Argument in the suit brought by George
McComb to recover from Powel Fredrick
the records of the Justices' Clerk was
concluded yesterday, and the case sub
mitted to the court for decision. In tak
ing the question at issue under adv'ise
inent, Judge Sloss, before whom the
case was argued, stated that he consid
ered himself bound by- the decision that
had been previously rendered by himself
and two of his colleagues, to the effect
that Mayor Schmitz's appointment of
Fredrick was illegal. He further stated
'hat he considered there are but two
points involved in the present action
first, whether the Mayor's veto of the
appointment of McComb is sustained by
the charter, and whether McComb's fail
ure to- â¢ properly file his bond, rejected
as it was by Mayor Schmitz, destroyed
Ills claim to the office of Chief Clerk.
Has Not Unlimited
Veto Power.

Is to Have Clerk's
Records.

In wheat was an anxious effort to undo the errors
of yesterday/ The bears who plucked up cour
age to sell short heavily yesterday, and pressed
prices back changed front at the opening when
it, was* learned that the rains reported yesterday
were by no means sufficient for the needs of the
winter wheat crop.; CableR were lower at the
start and Northwestern farmers were [ reported
making better deliveries of wheat. 'The general
outlook,* however,' was decidedly bullish and at
the very start of the gong there was an exciting
rush to buy. Â¦ May opened %c to %c higher at
73%c to 74%c and in' a very short -time was
rushfd to 75c. Â¦ Here trade eased off a little' and
prices hung steady for some time at'a sllght're
cesslon." Such . a , bulge naturally .'.brought out
large quantities of long stuff for r good profits.

tell comparatively Into the background to-day,
taking a place well down In the list of active
stocks. The etock was under pressure of real
izing all day, although it made some recovery
Â«.fter the official statement late in the day of
tbc absolute control exercised over Louisville
k and Naehvllle by J. P. Morgan. The somewhat
â¢QUivocal terms In which the Information has
been riven to the public regarding tne settle
ment of the Louisville dispute ana the emphatic
disclaimer by Southern Railway officials of any
Interest on the part of that road. In the settle
ment had left room for all sorts of rumors of
possible further complications which It was
thought desirable, apparently, to check. Louis
ville and Nashville stock also rallied strongly
to 2% over last nlgfct after the statement had
appeared. As a matter of fact, ex
treme animation and a broadening show of
strength were the feature* of the market, bear

after allowing for the reckoning In half shares

averting the possibility of a coal miners'

Mbrgan's presence there.- The coalers all suf
fered from proflt-taklnjf toward the last, and
the leadership of the market was shifted to
Atchifcon, which rose suddenly to 84, followed
by Colorado Fuel and Louisville. The explana

NEW YORK. April 17. â Accordinsr to dls
patches to R. G. Dun & Co., the -outlook Is
encouraging for a larre. yield of winter wheat.
At mosf points the acreage Is equal to ' or
larger than last year and even in the few re
ports of "a . decreased area the loss Is put . at
only 10 per' cent, .while the most hopeful state
ments make the Increase 50 per cent. On the
.whole.. there, appears to have been little los*
durinsr the .winter ; . from , weather conditions,
although at few points the enow protection
was litht. ' Damate by insects is also lees
serious than a year ago. The least satisfactory
feature thus far is the lack of moisture, which
Is causing anxiety in a number - of States.
With averaee weather during the rest of the
season, however, there Is every reason to an
ticipate a 1 yield above the average and prob
ably fully equal to last year's crop. The lib
eral demand and good prices of the previous
season would naturally tend to -stimulate and
so reports of large acreage were to be ex
pected, but estimates of condition are more
sanguine than the Government report on'Apiil
1, which may be due to favorable weather dur
ing the last few weeks. - â¢

"New crop apricots are offered .by a broker
here on the basis of 7%c f. o. b. the coast la
bags" for choice Royals, July shipment. There
Is little Interest taken in the offering In dried
fruit circles her*. The opinion is expressed In
responsible quarter* that. In view of th.e un
certain prospects, there will be few buyers
willing to taXe the risk at the values men
tioned. -At the present time,' said a well
known coast dried fruit dealer to-day, the
prospects are favorable for a good output, and
at 7%c t. o. b. for choice Royals, from a eell
er t- point of view, there may be a rood specu
lation. The prospects, however, are not cer
tain. Danger to the crop from frost Is not
passed until after the middle of Ihe present
month. Should frost damage result, the fruit
at 7%c may be a g-ood buy. It is a matter
of speculation, looking at it from either side,
and I do not imagine a very large business
could be dene at the figures mentioned. Buy
ers. I think, would be willing to pay 6c per
pound f. o. b. and at that figure a large quan
tity might be sold on the coast. Last year
the opening price on choice Royals was from 8e
to S^c, but prices were not made until aft?r
eomet.hij.jr definite about ihe crop was known.
Belling .of futures eo far ahead is- not good
business policy." " â¢ -

NEW YORK STOCK. LIST.
(ailing 1%. The stock closed with a fractional
net loss. United States Steel stocks were
moved up a point after a long dormant period.
Tne evidences of recuperation in the local
money market were a conserving influence on
the speculation. The Subtreasury has contrib
uted something to the local money market by
reason of large pension payments- and credit
shipments of gold from San Francisco are com
ing in. The movement of currency from the
Interior is In favor of New York and the stead
iness of the sterling market shows that provi
sion for American subscriptions to the British
consol issue does not threaten immediate fur
ther srold exports. The market closed active
and irreirular.

Daly took a sure and effective way of
shuffling off the- "mortal coil." He cut
a hole in the ice of a creek just large
enough to pass through, squeezed him
self down the aperture into the icy waters
and shoved himself along several feet
under the Ice until he became uncon
scious. Several times before Daly tried
to take his life, but before each attempt,
however, he had been drinking and failed.
The man disappeared and nothing was
thought of it until one of the Â¦ section
crew noticed his hat near a freshly cut
hole in -the .ice. The body was discovered
by cutting away the ice. Daly made cer
tain of his death, for he cut the hole so
smaTTtna^t there- was' ndVbne chance in a
thousand of ever getting back through it.
So small ;had the- hole- been made that
when Daly pushed through it the flesh on
his shoulders was terribly bruised. He
had been working on a section at Crowley
for. more than a year. Nothing is known
of his relatives. â¢ Â¦ v .

denied ..to him : that he ever had a dress
suit case,: and.' said that he never ownec
one- or borrowed, one.' .
.7, Cole Strikes Back at Defendant.
The witness stated that Dimmick had ;
disagreeable habit : of drawing money 0:
his check and allowing it to , He as cash
He r gave his Â¦ check - one - day for I $20 an<
countedit as cash for several days. Thei
he gave Cole his check for $40 and tool
up the $20 check. He paid up everythinj
finally. 'Â¦Â¦' This last' answer was in respon3
to a question by George D.~ Collins, Dim
mick's : attorney. :- ~- .'
-â¢Superintendent Frank A; /Leach was re
called and .testified that when Cole wa;
appointed cashier, ha (Leach) suggestei
to Dimmick to procure a locksmith^ to. in
struct ,Mr. Cole how to make a new com
bination. Then the. witness .called upoi
Dimmick for the combination that- ha<
been used â¢ by him as cashier, and Dim
mick replied that he had taken it out o
the safe,"; and Â¦â¢ when Leach spoke ' to liin
sharply and â¢. Inquired ' by what ? right h<
had taken it out, Dimmick replicd^'hen
It is," and -produced it out of' hls^coa
pocket." . . â¢
: Dimmick, on the: same occasion, told
Mint Director Roberts that Cole once
paid out a - $5000 sack * of gold too â¢ much,
but discovered It a few moments .later,
and ran but to the gate where the money
was : being taken out on a truck and
brought back the extra sack * of gold , to
the -vault. ,;" , 'Â¦ .. .
"I have "been fearful," proceeded Dim
mick,>"ever since Cole was appointed
cashier that something would happen to
cause a shake-up here. I think it is re
markable that his carelessness ceased all
at once. I told that to Mr. Day. I called
Mr. Leach's attention" to whatever actual
error I .learned. â¢ * * I suspected
that : if , anything was wrong the cashier
would pile it on my head." "
W..K. Cole, the. cashier, was recalled'to
deny certain statements made by Dim
mick - about : shortages or over-cash. The
witness admitted that he had been short
$120 on one occasion, $20 on. another, and
on "another he had $400 over-cash. He i
emphatically- denied Dimmick's statement I
as. to. Cole having taken a $20 piece out of
the. vault, and denied the story about his
taking a sack of $5000 f 5pm a truck that
he had overpaid by that sum.
Dimmick, told me ;that ' Cole could silt the
back of a sack and take out the money and
substitute something else. Or he could cut
the strings tied around the necks of the sacks,
and as the ' strings were wrapped â¢ three times
around them he could re- tie them twice. He
6ald that the cashier, could have carried away
a sack at a time by putting It Into his over
coat pocket and folding the coat In the usual
way. upon his arm. I told Dimmick that ; I
did not think his theories plausible, and'Dim
mick said there was another method by which
he . could pay the money to a confederate on
the outside. For Instance, Cole could tell Cap
tain Fitzpatrick to bring out forty-one sacks
when ne wanted . only forty, and the captain
wouldn't know anything about it. WhenP
asked him about the dress suit case Dimmick
said Â¦ that he - never had a dress suit case and
what Watchman Muller saw him with . on the
Oakland boat were his private books, which
he was taking home to work on at night. Dim
mick explained his presence In the Mint as
late as midnight by saying that he was getting
out a "book for Mr. Leach showing the condition
Of .. the % melters\ and refiners' department.
Blame Dumped on Cole's Shoulders.
Louis M. Slater, private secretary of
Superintendent Leach, was recalled and
read from his stenographic notes a state
ment made* by Dimmick July 10 and 11,
1901, in the presence of Mint Director Rob
erts and" Secret . Service Agent Hazen.
During . that investigation Dimmick said
that he had known of several , instances
in which Cashier Cole had made short
payments and over-payments. .The flnst
shortage he . had discovered was one of
$120 in November, 1900, after Cole had
been officiating as cashier for about
two \months. ! When Dimmick I called . the
cashier's attention to the matter. Cole
said, "Yes, I am $120 short,, but. I expect
to find it because I know. where I paid
it out."
Dimmick marked this matter on his
daily report and called Superintendent
Leach's attention to it. A few days later
Mr. Leach asked Dimmick whether the
shortage had been paid and Dimmick re
plied in the negative. Cole remarked to
Dimmick that- it' was a little expensive
piece of business and had cost him half
a month's salary.
Three months later Dimmick/ as chief
clerk, found that Cashier Cole had $400
cash over and above what should be
there. Cole looked through his accounts,
but could not find where. the mistake was.
Dimmick. tried to trace the depositors,
but as many of them were Klondike men
and had no fixed place of abode, he was
unable to find them.' The money was
always counted in - stacks of $400 each,
and that mistake might have been made
by counting one of the stacks twice. The
$120 shortage was deducted from the $400
over-cash and the $280 remaining was
placed in the. cashier's safe.. On. another
day at the close of work Dimmick discov
ered a shortage of $27, and Cole said that
he knew where it was, and, stepping into
the vault, '. he returned â¢ with the money
and put it into the tray. Dimmick said
to Cole, "You can't do that; because, if
you do, your vault account will be
wrong." In a few days the shortage was
made up. and the cash balanced to a
cent. At other times . there was a.ten
dollar shortage and $300 over-cash. "If a
man will make these mistakes," - said
Dimmick, "it is reasonable to suppose
that he will make others. I am satisfied
that-Cashier Cole is $30,000 short in his
accounts. .1 knew it the moment I figured <
it up that -Saturday afternoon." - -
. How Cole Recovered a Sack.
Burns, in - order to draw out Dimmick
still : further, asked him how it was pos
sible for Cole . to get money, out of the
Mint without being : detected. Mr. Burns
added: â¢ . -' '
Dimmick on the Art of Larceny.
:' Mr. Dimmick said that the $30,000 had un
doubtedly been taken by. the cashier, .who was
a careless. . incompetent man, and that owing
to a series ol overpayments the cashier had
been compelled to take a sack of coin and . go
to ' certain . unknown persons for â¢ advice, and
when thos3 persons learned what he had done
they jammed him. For Instance, say that Cole
was three sacks short, and his advisers saw an
opportunity of compelling him to take j three
sacks more. .'Â».'.â¢, \ ....
