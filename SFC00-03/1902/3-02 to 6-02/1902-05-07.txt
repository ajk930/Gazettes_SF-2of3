H /H /. Rear Admiral William T.
K|X fix Sampson! retired/died at
Hr H^ his home in this city at 5
Â» * o'clock this afternoon.
The immediate cause of
death was a severe cerebral hemorrhage.
He had been in a semi-conscious state for
several days. At the bedside when the
admiral breathed his last j were Mrs.
Sampson, Mrs. Lieutenant Cluverius, the
admiral's married daughter; Admiral
Sampson's two young sons, Ralph and
Harold Sampson; Dr. DIxon, the attend
ing physician, and nurses and attendants.
Mrs. Sampson has broken down- under
the severe strain and was quite ill all
during the day. But for the critical con
dition of the admiral she would have been
confined to her -bed.
PLANS FOR FUNERAL.
The arrangements for the funeral of
Admiral Sampson will not be completed,
until morning. \ It has been suggested to
Mrs. gampspn that the Naval Academy
at Annapolis would be the proper place
for the last resting place,* while other
friends have represented to her that; he
should be buried in Arlington Cemetery,
near this city. Admiral Sampson resided
In Annapolis eight years, during- four of
which he was superintendent of . the
academy there. Mrs. Sampson prefers
Annapolis, but the matter will not be
definitely decided until to-morrow. The
pallbearers have not yet ' been selected,
but they will include Â¦Â¦ among them some
of the captains of the ships of the fleet
which engaged in the Santiago campaign.
Mrs. Sampson suffered a slight Â¦ accident
four days ago while attending to the
wants of the admiral and has been in bed
since. She probably will not be able to
attend the' funeral services.
MESSAGES OF CONDOLENCE.
A number of telegrams and messages
of condolence have been received already
at the house, among them one from Sec
retary Moody. . Â¦
The death of Admiral Sampson occur
ring late in the day there has been no
opportunity yet for any action- by the
Navy Department for participating: in the
funeral services. Suitable representation
will be made, however, Including a de
tachment of bluejackets and marines. ;
j Washington is divided to-night between
regret that a heroic figure has passed
away and sympathy for the family. Secre
tary Moody said:; "I have learned of the.
death of Admiral Sampson with deep con
'cern, which I am sure will be shared by
every officer of the navy, both on the active
and retired lists. His name has been in
separably connected with the great events
of our recent history. His life was too
important and his services too conspicu

THE HAGUE, May 7.-Advices received
here from Castle Loo, dated 1 o'clock this
morning, declare that Queen Wilhelmina'a
condition again excites grave anxiety.
Another consultation of the Queen's doc
tors was held at 11 o'clock last night. The
result of this consultation is not known.
Extreme secrecy is maintained as to the
contents of the telegrams dispatched from
Loo Palace. This and other measures are
believed to indicate that the condition of
her Majesty is much graver than appears
from the regular bulletins. It is said that'
the Queen 13 so weak that she has been
unable to take any nourishment since last
Saturday.
PREMIER KEPT POSTED.
Dr. Roessingh never leaves her Maj
jesty's bedside, except for a brief and
much-needed rest, when he Is always re
placed by Dr. Pot. After the consultation
held last night Professor Rosenstein was
summoned to the palace. He was con
sulted before the operation of last Sunday.
v A special Government wire has been
established between Loo Palace and The
Hague, and Dr. Kuper, the Dutch Pre
mier, is Informed every half hour of the
progress of the royal 'patient.
The Queen mother and the Prince Con
sort remain constantly at her Majesty's,
bedside. Dr. Roessingh very carefully
dictates whatever news concerning Queen
Wilhelmina' s condition is issued from the
palace, and he declines to say anything;
further concerning his patient.
STILL GRAVE DANGER.
It is understood that although the offi
cial bulletins represent the Queen's tem
perature as normal, it invariably rises
toward midnight, and that never for a
moment since last Saturday has there
been a cessation oX anxiety.
The weather at Loo Palace continues
very cold.
LONDON, May 7.â The Brussels corre
spondent of the Daily Telegraph says the
Netherlands legation at Brussels has re
ceived a dispatch to the effect that the
physicians still fear peritonitis and blood
poisoning in the case of Queen Wilhel
mina. ' i
the court has declared that she was not
the wife of the late James G. Fair.
After Mr. Wheeler Garret McEnerney
appeared on the scene as the attorney for
the execcutors of the Fair estate, and in
a very able and forceful^argument in fa
vor of a final distribution and the setting
aside of Mrs." Craven as an obstacle to
the settling up of the case, he, too, gave
vent to arguments and expressions which
plainly denoted that his clients were tired
of their jobs and desired to hand over the
estate to those to whom It rightfully be
longed.
Mrs. Craven's attorneys, Messrs. Ma
guire and Pence, are fighting hard to
have the proceedings attending the final,
distribution of the Fair millions " post
poned, giving as a reason the fact, that
they intend to bring suit against the
heirs over the property to which Mrs.
Craven holds deeds, which have been al
ready declared by the court to be for
geries.
During the course of Mr.' Wheeler's ar
gument he waxed fervid and handled tha
subject of "litigation that clogs the
wheels of justice", without gloves. He
said:
A dozen new trials or a hundred or a thou
sand or a million to determine the status and
interest of a litigant Is not contemplated by
any scheme of the law. The Leeislature did
not contemplate that a litigant should be al
lowed to come Into court at every stase of a
probate proceeding and ask the court to go Into
matters again and again and again and make
new conclusions of facts when It has already
declared its findings. This court has distinctly
declared that Nettie R. Craven is not tha
widow and never was â¢ the wife of , James O.
Fair, deceased, and it is the duty of the court
to now make an order declaring her an in
truder â to exclude her from further participa
tion In the case and refuse ' to hear her any
further, on any matters attendant ttpon the
settlement of this case.
The policy of thÂ« law as I take it Is not to
hinder the administration of estates. It would
be a premium on blackmail If persons could
come Into court and attempt to have the same
thing tried over and over again and thereby
tie up estates running: Into millions.
To say that > this court Â¦ has not during: the
trial of this case, which has taken up a period
of eleven months, taken -Judicial cognizance or
knowledge and so declared that Xettic It.
Craven Is not the wife of James G. * Fair Is
nonsensical. If she la to be recoznlzed here
in this proceeding, then I say that our probate
law Is in an anomalous ' and chaotic condition.
One time Is sufficient to determine- the status
and interest' of a litigant and that should set
tle it for all time. If K is not, new trial will
follow new and the claimant can come
Into court and block the progress of the final
settlement of an estate as often as she pleases.
McEnerney then, bored into the kernel
of the situation with his weight of legal
lore. He pointed out that as far as the
executors of the Fair estate were con
cerned it didn't make any difference to
them who got the estate. He further
showed that even if the Supreme Court
were to declare that Mrs. Craven was
entitled to a share, she would be none the
loser for having lost her fight ; to block
the final distribution. . The hearing Will
go on again at 2 o'clock this afternoon.

SAN RAFAEL., May 6.â During the trial
to-day of the suit brought by Joseph Har
vey against Adolph Silva, which has been
occupying the attention of Judge Angel
lotti in the Superior Court for several'
days', sensational accusations were made
by the defendant's attorney. While Har
vey was on the witness stand he was ac
cused by Innuendo of having received $40,
000 from the Fair estate, with which to
pay Silva and others for services rendered
during: Mrs. Nettie R. Craven's contest
of the. late Senator Fair's will. This
amount was paid,' Silva's attorneys Inti
mated, in four certified checks of $10,000
each, drawn upon the Crocker- Woolworth
National Bank of San Francisco, and was
given to Joseph Harvey in April, 1900. The
accusatipns were made during- the cross
examination of Harvey. Attorney O. H.
Meldon, who represents Silva, after as
certaining that the witness knew Herman
Oelrichs and Charles Fair, asked this
question:
"Is it not a fact, Mr. Harvey, that in
April, 1900, you received from George A.
Knight the sum of $40,000 to be paid to
Adolph Silva' and others for services ren
dered in the Craven contest of Fair's
will?" ' . " .
"I did not."
] "Is it not a fact that on or about April
30, 1900, you. received four checks of $io,000
each, certified to by the Crocker-Wool
worth National Bank, to be given to
Adolph Silva and others for services ren
dered in the Fair, case?" .
. "I did not receive a quarter of a dollar
from the Fairs or any one else to be paid
Â¦to^Silva^ox., any one- in, Â¦ the .Craven . con
test:' 1 ' ;/: . : ; ; :r- : "5z Â¦ -^"v"" 5"-^ Â¦
PAID SILVA NO MONEY.
"Did you not pay to Adolph Silva the
sum of $20,000?" ,.
"I did. not." â¢'-..,
"Is * it not a fact that on April 25 you
rented a safe deposit box for Silva, in"
which' he was to place the $20,000 paid to
him for services in the Fair case?".
"No, I did not. The whole story is ab
solutely false and preposterous."
"Is it hot a fact that in February, 1901.
Silva asked you for $1000 on account of
money, due him for services in the Fair
case and that you told him that you had
just paid out $17,000 to State Senators to
protect poolselling in this State?".
"I did not."
"Is it not a fact that in October, 1901,
you received a letter from Adolph Silva,
claiming money due him from the Fairs
and demanding the same?"
"I did not."
"Is it not a fact that In "March, 1900,
you and Silva went to Meiggs wharf to.
wait for a steamer for the purpose of in
tercepting pertain witnesses for Mrs.
Craven?"
An objection to this question was sus
tained.
NATURE OF THE LITIGATION.
Joseph Harvey is suing Adolph Silva for
a. one-half interest in the Sausalito Elec
tric Light Company. . He alleges that he
gave . Silva $4000 with which to purchase
that- interest for â¢ him, but that Silva
bought the property in his own name and
refused to assign the deed. Silva has in
stituted a counter suit, alleging that $4000
was paid to him by Harvey, but that the
sum was in- part payment of 520,000 due
him from Harvey. He prays for judgment
for the balance. of $16,000.
Other witnesses called to-day were
Thomas Frost, owner of the other one
half interest in the electric light com
pany; G. W. Ebner; of the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank, John Farley of the Peerless
saloon. In San Francisco and Frank Da
rcux, a bookmaker at Sausalito.
FROST, SUPPORTS HARVEY.
Frost's testimony supported â¢ Harvey's
contention. ' He j said . that he wished to
become sole owner of the electric system,
and tried to get the money wherewith to
purchase the outstanding half-interest.
Silva told him that he (Silva) could get
the money from Harvey. Silva saw Har
vey â¢ and later told Frost that Harvey
agreed to let him have any sum up to
$5000. Silva said he would bid in the elec
tric light interest in Harvey's name and
Frost could repay Harvey. Silva in real
ity bid in the property in his own name
and still retains it.
j Ebner, Farley and,Daroux gave testi
mony, to prove that the $4000 was given to
Silva by Harvey, the former telling of its
having, been certified : to by the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank, and the other, two men
having seen .Harvey give the check to
Silva in Farley's saloon. '?'Â»'"'.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STRETT, N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 6.â If Congress
falls to pass the Philippine civil govern
ment bill and the Cuban reciprocity meas
ure, President Roosevelt will call an ex
tra session of that body for the purpose
of enacting this legislation. Roosevelt has
notified the leaders of the Senate and the
House of his determination, and they un
derstand that he is thoroughly in earnest.
The present session will probably last
till the middle of June, and if the Phil
ippine and Cuban bills are not passed,
Congress, therefore, will be compelled to
reassemble later in the summer.
CONVEYS THE NOTICE.
The President, within the last twenty
four hours, has conveyed notice of his
purpose to call an extra session to such
men as Senator Allison, Senator Hanna
and other members of the steering com
mittee of the upper house. These Sena
tors are, of course, doing the best they
can with the pending measures, but the
positiveness of the President's position
will doubtless spur them to greater ef
forts.
Democratic Senators have expressed
their determination to talk the Philippine
bill to death, if possible, and the Repub
lican leaders, if they desire to avoid an
extra session, will have to stop this char
acter of filibustering. On the other hand,
there are Republican Senators who are
standing in the way of the Cuban reci
procity measure, and they, too, will have
to be brought to a realization of the ne
cessity of the enactment of some legisla
tion for the bill for Cuba.
. _ WILI* _W0BK JHABDEB.. ,â
It is hoped that the necessity for an ex
tra session will be avoided, and most of
the leaders in Congress will doubtless do
their utmost to prevent it. By June the
lawmakers for the most part will be
ready to quit for the summer, for Wash
ington Is not the most salubrious place in
which to live during the hot months, and
furthermore, most of the Representatives
and Senators have political matters at
home which require their attention during
the regular recess. Such men as Sena
tors Allison, Hanna and Aldrich will em
ploy every legitimate means to secure the
enactment of Philippine and Cuban leg
islation during the present session.
Meanwhile no one of the leaders has
anything to say about the Nicaragua bill,
which is a matter quite as important to
the Republican party as any now pending
in Congress.
WASHINGTON, May 6.â For almost
four hours to-day a fierce discussion of
the Philippine question raged In the Sen
ate. It was started by Bcveridge of In
diana, who made some sharp' strictures
on the members of the opposition, be
cause, as he said, they persisted in telling
in their speeches only one side of thj
Eton*.
Carmack and Rawlins -warmly resented
any Imputation of unfairness. Rawlins
declared that no partisan motives had ac
tuated the opponents of the present Phil
ippine policy, but that they were moved
only by patriotism and love of country-
Turner of Washington delivered a
scathing criticism of the methods prac
ticed by the military authorities in the
Philippines, dwelling particularly upon the
alleged order of General Smith, whom he
denounced as a monster in human form.
WILL BE INVESTIGATED.
Turner referred to the special dispatch
frcrn Lynn, Mass., which, on the author
ity of Rev. "W. H. Walker, told of. the
execution of 1000 Filipino prisoners by. a
battalion of American troops because
there was not sufficient food for them.
Rev. Dr. Walker told the story on the
authority of his son, J. B. Walker, a pri
vate in Company I. Sixteenth Infantry.
Turner said he did not vouch for the
truth of the story, but felt that it ought
to be investigated.
Lodge replied that he would investigate
the matter, althougk he felt it was ut
terly without foundation.
Hoar of Massachusetts briefly defend
ed the action of the Philippine Commit
tee, saying that already it had furnished
much valuable information.
I TVhen the Philippine Committee met t6
6ay Senator Lodge presented a cable from
General Chaffee, giving the charges and
specifications of Major Gardener rela
tlt-e to Tayabas province. The charge
consisted of allegations that troops had
burned buildings, ill treatment of the na
tives by Lieutenant G. D. Catlin and
criminal assault on five Â¦women by sol
diers. Senator Lodge stated to the com
mittee that Catlin had been under treat
ment for deran&ed mind.
The witness bofore the committee to
day was R. V. Hughes of Philadelphia.
formerly private in Company H, Eighth
Infantry. He testified to seeing the water
cure administered to a native when the
troops were searching for information; he
also saw one native knocked down twice
by order of Lieutenant Merchant anh
another beaten on the chest with a stick
to make him give information. He said the
insurgents engaged in similar work and
gave an instaj/e of an American soldier
cut to pieces with bolos. He testified that
the native prisoners were well treated, the
Fick cared for and the food furnished very
nearly the same as that furnished the
American troops.
REGRETTED BY CHAFFEE.

1 Sampson was appointed chairman of a com
-mission to investigate the affair, his associates
being Captain F. Â£^ Chadwick and Lieutenant
Commander F. E. Pattee of . the cruiser New

Captain Sampson . then returned to his com
mand, but soon after, -under orders from the
Navy Department and with tha title of acting
.rear admiral.; began --to assemble a fleet at
Key V'ett in anticipation of- the declaration of
war which was surely expected. ;â¢ >>>-.
On receipt or oewÂ« â¢' April â¢ 22. 1898,- that the
. United States Minister to Spain had demanded
his passports, with the Xew York as flagship
-the fleet set out from. Key West to begin the
. blockade of Cuban ports. The formal declara
. tlon of war came three' days later. On May
12 with several of hi*-- largest vessels Sampson
I bombarded the city of. San Juan, Porto Rico.
' and then returned to -the blockading station off
the coast of Cuba. , -
â¢ On May 19 the- Spanish fleet under Admiral
C Cervera, which had left -the Cape Verde Islands
Â¦ for Cuba April ,30, .entered â¢ Santiago harbor,
where It was discovered on May 27 and block
Â¦ s<!ed by the division of Sampson's force under
. Commodore W.' â¢&. Schley. A few days later
Sampson arrived with other vessels and as
sumed command.- ! The blockade was main
â¢tained rigidly until ihe early morning of "Julv
3. when Admiral Cervera. seeing the capture
'of the city inevitable, sought to escape with
. eome If not all his vessels. .
The result is yet fresh In the minds of the
Â¦people of the whole world. The Spanish fleet
. was utterly destroyed, with a loss of 400 killed
and 1<X)O taken prisoners, of whom 500 were
wounded. The glory of the affair, of which
Â¦Schley said there was enough for all in his sig
nal report to Admiral Sampson when the latter
"arrived on the scene of the surrender of the
Colon, thÂ« last of the Spanish fleet, was dim
,me<l. however, by the very unseemly contro
versy which arose over the question as to
r who was ln command during the fight.
j In view of the tact that Admiral Sampson
nearly an hour before the fight began had
Â¦eteamed away with the New York to Slboney.
1 some fourteen miles to the east, and did not get
Â¦ back in time to participate in the battle.
'Schley'e friende. contended that as the next in
'(rrade a.n<2 seniority he was <3e jure and de facto
. the commander during the battle.
This dispute opened up charges and recrlm
' inatioc â¢ dating back to the beginning of the
war, the bitter echoes of which are yet sound
ing in the ears, of the people, who. In spite of
'the fact that Sampson was officially accorded
the credit for the victory, 'by a large majority
Admiral Samptson was considered one: of the
first officers of the* navy in matters of naval
science. He was an expert "on ordnance, tor
pedoes, etc., and with Lieutenant Strauss de
vlstrt and perfected the plan of superimposed
turrets recently adopted in our navy. Admiral
fcampson was twice marriedâ first in 1862 to
Miss Margaret Aldrich of Palmyra, N. Y., by
whom he had four daughters, and second In
1882 to Miss Elizabeth Burling of Canandalgua,
a. Y., who bore hirn three sons.
- In September. 18S8. Sampson was appointed
one of the three Commissioners to settle affairs
:n Cuba and in December of that year, having
been made commodore, resumed command of
the North Atlantic squadron. In 1809 he was
promoted to rear admiral, and on October 4 of
that year was put ln -command of the Boston

That this painful and bitter controversy hast

for doubt. During the war Admiral Sampson

Then came a friendly contest ; for the en
tertainment of the â¢ next biennial Mrs
Williams, who spoke for Minneapolis said
the Commercial Club had pledged the
money and promised to do all the work
and tried to tempt the delegates to believe
this would be taxation without reorespn
tation Mrs. Shields of Missouri, backed
f^ tl0I1S . fr ?, m men ln nlsh'positionB,
extended a similar "courtesy from st!
The last question considered related to
the reduction of the per capita tax from
10 to 5 cents, which induced, Mrs. Lydia
Williams of Minnesota to speak ; scorn
fully of the federation as ''doing business
on a nickel basis." Mrs. Lowe also made
pertinent remarks â¢ against a reduction.
She said the tax might be cut in two and
still not cripple Xhe treasury, -but. at the
same time she hinted at the advisability
of the federation paying the expenses of
every officer. This suggestion pleased the
delegates. If one might judge by: the ap
plauee.y- Â¦ . ,. : Â¦ .,
The decision to adopt the parliamentary
manual of Mrs. -Emma Fox; the present
recording secretary, as authority for the
federation, led Mrs. Urquhart Lee, an*ex
pert parliamentarian who has crossed
swords with Mrs. Fox more than once, to
urge the acceptance of some manual writ
ten by a man. Mrs. Fox's indignation
found vent in a few tears, but consola
tion came in the ultimate support of the
convention. â¢ .
NO TAX REDUCTION.
Then came consideration of section 3
of article II, the second feature in the
color problem. This section is part of
the present by-laws and when Miss Jane
Addams of Hull House, Chicago, offered
to amend it Mrs. Lowe, notwithstanding
that the usual sixty days' notice had not
been given, so graciously gave indulgence
to the famous sociologist as to call forth
warm applause and the appreciative
acknowledgment from Miss Addams Won
a like tribute from the audience.
Miss Addams, who believes in the ad
mlsion of colored clubs, desired to have
this section amended, so that two instead
of one adverse vote on the membership
committee of five would be necessary to
keep out an unwelcome club. Miss Ad
dams made a worthy -plea, but it was re
jected by a large vote. ... .
The convention then turned its atten
tion to the compromise amendments, first
Considering section 0 of article I. After
several attempts to change it, it was ac
cepted as prepared: by' the compromise
committee. :' . â¢
Massachusetts was obliged to bow to
adverse fate,' in'the first place "' when it
was discovered that her, cherished series
of amendments'," which have been promul
gated throughout the length and breadth
of the country these; last' two years, were
Illegal, in that they disfranchised mem
bers already accepted. They were, there

While Massachusetts is sorrowful, there
is no element of bitterness , in the defeat,
- the .union of the South and North, as
far as women's" clubs are concerned,
promises, to remain cemented for some
time to come-- Mrs. Lowe's management
of the j convention,' moreover, was mas
terful at every-turn. \
LOS ANGELES, May 6.â Tuesday,
. May 6, may be chronicled as the
day when Massachusetts club
.women saw all the, pet plans, for
.. ... which they had been fighting for
two'years go down before the vote of the
convention of the â¢ Federated Women's
Clubs. The final protest* was given to the;
admission of -colored women's clubs,;' the"
effort, to down the individual club, as a
step" toward reorganization through State
federations, failed, and the plan to reduce
the per capita tax i'rom 10 to 5 cents was
snowed under. Massachusetts was defeat
ed at every? turn, while the women of the
South, who have led in the opposition,
particularly on the color and reorganiza
tion questions, are' happy. Indeed, the
dispatch with which the three, issues
were defeated, in the midst of intense ex
citement on both' sides, is a matter of
surprise even to tfce delegates who aided
in this result. " .,

Thus Massachusetts is defeated at all
turns, and it may be said that the Mas

scheduled to have the consideration of the
convention, along with the compromise
amendments, were withdrawn this morn

that they proposed to-disfranchise mem
bers already In the federation., . =
*"We are far from our counsel," sal-1
Mrs. Anna West of Boston, "and rather
than contest the point we withdraw."
The matter of the per capita tax, which
is now 10 cents, and on account of which
several clubs have left the federation on
the ground that it is excessive, came up
In the form of an amendment, to make it
5 cents. This was lost.' as was also the
effort to reduce the taxation of clubs of
less than forty members to $2. The an
nual dues for State federations shall be
20 cents per club, as heretofore, and a
new clause provides' that dues for each

At the suggestion: of Mrs. Lowe it was
decided, to send the 'sympathy of .the fed
eration to Mrs. Potter Palmer of .Chicago
because of the death of her husband.
Just at the close of the . session Mrs..
Decker, upon request, was called to the
chair, and the greeting she received was
taken as evidence of her popularity as a
presidential candidate. Â¦ â¢ , i

In the proposed adoption of section 3,
of article II, special indulgence of the
house was accorded Miss Jane Addams
of Hull Houae, Chicago, in that she had
not served sixty â¢ days' Â¦ notice of an
amendment to a present by-law. Miss Ad
dams wished to have two adverse votes
on the membership committee necessary
for the rejection of an application," in
stead of one, but this was lost. Tlje. sec
tion remains as heretofore, with barriers
around the .possible admission of . a col
ored club, and is as follows: :_Â¦;Â£Â»

ty-five clubs or less shall - be 'entitled to be

handled by Mrs. -Lillian Duncanson of Il
linois, who said In part:
The problems of one " community are much
the same, as thoae of another community and
an interchange of experiences is most helpful.
Through local federations the work of one club
may be given to another and general commit
tees formed with representatives from all
sorts and. kinds of organizations, making a
unity of interest and a combination of effort
that would be a great power.
K The federation meeting is the clearing-house
of the system. Accounts are balanced by ac
counts and credit given where credit is due.
It is an exchange of values and acts as a valve
on expenditures. Time is too valuable to
duplicate efforts as must be done where sev
eral organizations work along the same lines,
and an idealsystem is that of local federations
as centers, from which the direction of all
the . work shall emanate. ,
One of the afternon sessions, on "Value '
of Subordinate Federations," was in j
charge of Mrs. A. H. Thompson of Kan
sas. In closing her report Mrs. Thomp
son said: . .
Much has -already been accomplished by
lecal federations in civic work, and here, per
haps, their value has been most apparent to ;
the community, for good housekeeping, clean- â¢
lir.ess and love of beautiful surroundings are
essentially womanly virtues, and the . interest
in these things in the community as well as
in the. home is accepted as the natural province
of women. THis.work is, however, still In its
Infancy, and will increase in ever widening cir
cles of influence and opportunity. ;
If the subordinate federation would open its
doors not only to clubs devoted to study, but
invite all those interested in either philan
thropic or educational movements,' including
the teachers of the schools and the boards of
local charitiee, the value of the federation
would be greatly Increased.
Â¦ Simultaneously another session on civil
service -reform was in charge of Miss Per
kins of . Massachusetts. Among the lead-
Ing speakers were Mrs. Sarah Platt
Decker, who presented the subject as it re
lates, to public institutions of charity and
correction, and Mrs: Thaddeus Stanwood
of Illinois, who handled "Civil Service Re
form in Our Public Scttdols."
Mrs. Stanwood argued that the teaching
of civics In the high schools should be so
arranged as to bring to the minds of tho
pupils the dignity and honor of civil ser
vice, and should leave in their minds a
practical and genuine desire to further
.the work of civil service reform.

Detective Palmer's report te as follows:
Detective Department,
City of Victoria. B. C. May 3, 1002.
J. M. Lancley, Chief of Police â 81ri Acting
upon your instructions of the 1st inst., I inter
viewed the DroDrletor of the Driard Hotel, G.
A. Hartnagle. who said he could not allow the
leaves of his register to be cut out. but he would
be pleased to loan Captain Seymour them on
condition that they be returned to him Intact
when finished with. I inclose tracings taken
from the registers of Hadley's signatures, two
of each â one copy taken by myself and one by
the hotel clerk, John H. Smith, who was clÂ«rk
in 1899, and remembers Hadley and can swear
to the signature. I interviewed Marsden, the
news agent, who says that Hadley was smooth
shaven when here, but he came into his store
one day wearing a dark false mustache, which
he explained that he wore for devilment to fool
girls with. I also saw Saunders, Oe hackman,
who says he never saw him with beard- or mus
tache, but says Hadley had sore eyes; that the
bartender, Vaughan, gave- him a souvenir beer
glass of the Brown Jus saloon; that Hadley
left -on the Vancouver boat . one night, was
drunk and never left the boat and returned,
here, which would account for the two entries
in Ausust. 189C. Tours obediently,
THOMAS PALMER. â¢
Detective Serjeant.
Chief .of Police "Wittman Issued a cir
cular yesterday furnishing an excellent
description of Hadley and formally ac
cusing him of the murder of Nora FuIIt.
The circular also bears several exemplars
of .Hadley's handwriting "and a sample
of ,the handwriting of the man who sicn
ed himself C. B. Hawkins. These circu
lars will be scattered; broadcast over tho
land.
between the ages of 14. and 16 'years to
his rooms.- - .
L,lttleby little-Detective Gibson Is cor
roborating i the story told .by Â¦- Ollie Dixon,
who ) lived : with Hadley : : as . his wife for
more' than a; year, and who first directed
"suspicion .Jn. "Hadley's direction. In her
statement to the police Mrs. Hadley,. as
she was known, stated that she at one
lime found a little girl in Hadley's room,
and on learning that she was wilting for
Hadley, Hadley's alleged wife ordered her
to leave 'the' house. The Dixon" woman
said' in her, statement to the( police that
Hadley's visitor., was a young girl. De
tective Gibson and Captain Seymour, who
have been working on the case personally,
have located the girl whom Hadley'-s mis
tress,found in' the room. . She confesses
that she had visited Hadley at his apart
ments,- and also | gave" other valuable in
formation which Captain Seymour refuses
to divulge. It- is known, however, that
Hadley gave her a pair of diamond ear
rings . and a gold watch and tried to In
duce'her-to run away from her home
and go with him to Honolulu. This young
girl is â¢ said to know something important
concerning Hadley's ! connection with the
murder of. Nora Fuller, and for this rea
son Captain Seymour will not- at present
make known her identity.
EVIDENCE IS DAMNING^
Handwriting. Expert -Kytka has secured
another large batch of the missing man's
handwriting, and he has made several
more important discoveries, .tending 'to
prove that Charles B. Hadley Is the man
who rented the house on Sutter street and
Inserted the advertisement in the newspa
pers. Up to the present time Captain Sey
mour has succeeded In securing some very
strong evidence against Hadleyâ evidence
that will undoubtedly be sufficient to send
him to the scaffold if he is apprehended.
Captain Seymour is of the opinion that
Hadley has made his escape to Mexico,
where he fled fourteen years ago when
he got into financial trouble in*Chlcago.
At that time he wore a false mustache
as. a disguise. . The .theory is advanced
that ever since then he has at various
times been compelled to wear a false
mustache to avoid .detection by people
who came to this city from Chicago and
who knew him there.
DISGUISED IN VICTORIA.
That. Hadley was in the habit of wea/
ing a false mustache is no. longer de
nied. While ih Victoria in 1899 he went
into the store of the Examiner agent at
that place wearing a false j black mus
tache, and when asked why he wore the
disguise replied: "Oh, just to have some
fun with the girls."
Chief of Police Langley of Victoria has
been doing all he can to assist Captain
Seymour in working up the case against
Hadley. He has sent tracings of Had
ley's signature on the register at the Ho
tel Driard, which correspond exactly to
the signature of C. B. Hawkins, which
Expert Kytka says Hadley wrote on the
rental contract at Umbsen's. Captain
Seymour is anxious to get the page of the
register on which the signature is written
and he has' requested the police of Vic
toria to induce the proprietor of the hotel
to allow them to remove the page of each
register upon which Hadley wrote his
signature on his various trips to Victoria.
Following is a copy of a letter received
from Victoria yesterday and also a re
port made by Detective Palmer, of that
place; .
HANDWRITING SECURED.
-> John- F.j Seymour. Captain of Detectives, San
Francisco,' Cal. â Dear Sir:- In' answer to your
letter of the 26th ult.. I Inclose copy of 'report
No. 2 by Detective ' Palmer.
VICTORIA. B."C..""May 3, 1002.
THE police now- openly charge
Charles B. Hadley, the' missing
accountant and bookkeeper of the
| Examiner, with the brutal; mur-
der of Nora Fuller. Chief of De
tectives .', Seymour: has located^ a promi
nent citizen, . whose -name he refuses" to
divulge at this time, who saw Hadley and
Nora Fuller together near the corner of
Grant avenue and Â¦ Geary street a short
time before she disappeared.' This im
portant^ discovery is, perhaps, the first
positive^ evidence that' has been unearth
ed in connection ' with the | investigation
into Hadley's connection with, the mur
der. Detective Tom Gibson found the
man, who makes the. startling statement
that he saw Hadley with Nora Fuller,
and. both Gibson and his superior officers
are satisfied that their witness is riot mis
taken. For reasons best known to them
selves the police do not intend' to give out
the name of .this witness. There has been
a powerful influence at work to obstruct
the police department in investigating the
case against, the missing man, and this
perhaps accounts for the refusal of : the
detective to divulge the name of the new
and important .witness.
RECOGNIZED HADLEY.
The witness in question is a respectable*
business man' and bears an excellent-rep
utation for truth and honesty. He knows
Hadiey well, and when he I saw him ac
companied by a young girl, rather oddly
dressed, he took particular notice of her.
He says he spoke to" Hadley, who bowed
and looked rather sheepish, supposedly
for the reason that he was a bit abashed
at being recognized by a friend while in
the company of such a little -girl. .'The
man in question has examined Nora Ful
ler's photograph in the costume she wore,
when she left home to meet the mythical
Bennett, and he positively; identifies it as
a likeness of the girl whom he saw in the
company of Hadley on either January 11
or the day before. The picture shown
this new witness was the one taken ex
clusively for The Call.
The day after the finding of : the body
Nora Fuller's clothes were placed on an
other girl, who posed at the suggestion of
The Call. A, likeness of the head of Nora
Fullerwas pasted on the photograph thus
taken and then rephotographed, the re
sult being a life-sized pictured the mur
dered girl as she looked the day she met
her brutal slayer. â¢ , .
GIRLS VISITED HIM.
Captain Seymour and his detectives
have also unearthed other important evi
dence which brings the crime closer to
Hadley's door. The investigation into the
missing man's manner -of living
has borne fruit. The police - have se
cured positive' information that Hadley

EUREKA, May â¬.â T he deliberations of
the City Council last evening were
stormy. A petition and affidavit were
presented by H. H. Griffiths, vice presi
dent and manager of the Stockton â¢ Brick
and Pottery Company, which is bidding to
supply the city of Eureka with sewer
pipe for its new system. The affiant al
leged that a combination, which he called
the sewer-pipe trust, had been formed
against his company and that this asso
ciation, by improper means, had a clause
placed. in the specifications whereby the
pipe must be supplied within forty-five
days from the time the contract was let,
making It impossible for' any. one com
pany to ship the quantity of pipe neces
sary within the given time. He further
alleged that the city of Eureka would be
overcharged $15,000 for the pipe if the
specifications were not altered.
Serious charges were made against D.
C. McDonald, recently appointed sewer
pipe inspector. .In the affidavit the fol
lowing appears:
That affiant had several conversations with
said D. C McDonald from March 2(i to April
1 or 2 in regard to bidding- upon the pipe for

threatening manner and declared that
any man who Insinuated that his motives
were not pure was a deliberate falsifier.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
EDUCATORS MEET
IN RAISIN CITY
.â¢George Lake, thfc^aged. brother of the
deceased, is down with grief. "When the
surveying' party' first discovered the
plight of Charles Lake on the, opposite
side of the river, , they summoned the
brother to the 7 river t>ank. / It was only
by force J that he was restrained .from
jumping into the torrent and endeavor
ing to swim to the other side. . "
Dr. M. V. Higgins received the call at
the latter^place, attached a riding horse
to his buggy, placed a saddle in the ve
hicle and started. Traveling in his buggy,
on horseback and on foot, he reached the
cabin, and the time in which he made the
tripiof almost eighteen miles is conceded
a record-breaker for mountain . travel.
But he arrived too late. A few minutes
before he reached the cabin old man
Lake breathed his last. .;.-:.â¢ Â¦
PHYSICIAN'S QUICK TRIP.
The surveyors racked their brains to de
vise some means of reaching the wound
ed miner.; Finally they built a rude cock
swain s chair, and Charles^ Scutt under
t00 _ k the , feat Â¦ of / traversing the
cable thereon. It was a- perilous
Journey and it took Scutt a half
hour to cross the three hundred- feet
of wire. His hands were badly lacerated,
but eventually - he reached the opposite
shore and hurled to where Lake was
lying, some distance up the river. He
took the old man to the cage and across
the river,. but first' tied up the wound to
stop the flow of blood. Lake was carried
on a litter up the steep hillside. When
more accessible , ground was reached,' one
of the men was sent to Yankee Hill, six
miles away,, to telephone for a physician
at Cherokee.
WOUNDED MAN'S PLUCK.
The gun fell to the cage below, but
Lake held. to and reached the top of the
ladder and made his way half a mile -up
stream to '.where he knew a surveying
party was located on the j opposite bank.
The roar of the. water prevented the sur
veyors from hearing his calla, but they
saw he was wounded and hastened down
stream to the cage, only to find that it
was on Lake's side of the watercourse.
Ihey could see that the old man needod
assistance -badly, but the attempt to
swiiu the North Fork meant almost cer
tain death. Â¦ ... .
Lake, who was '71 years old, had lived
'Â». a eorge of the North Fork, of Feather
River for fourteen years, eking but an ex
istence by scraping the: bedrock of pla
cers-abandoned by the. early- miners. He
lived , alone until last autumn, when a
brother from Boston, nearly as old as he,
came to share his cabin. Lake started on
Sunday morning to visit a place across
the river and took his shotgun. There
is no bridge over the river, but a cage
supported by a cable above and suspend
ed on. rollers affords a means* of 'crossing
the swift stream. Lake had reached the
o PP? s lte shore and had begun to climb a
ladder of about twelve rounds, 1 which led
to the rock above, holdinghis gun by the
Barrel, when the weapon was discharged.
The load passed through his right arm
above the elbow, tearing bone, flesh. and
muscle and leaving the meihber hanging
by a shred; on either side.
:OROVIL,LE,'May'6.â Coroner Bulllngton
of Butte County has returned - from . a
trip of twenty-four^ miles into an almost
inaccessible part .of .'.=Â¦ the , mountainous
country, north of this place. He went in
answer to a call' to take*chai-ge .of : the
body, of Charles Henry Lake, an old mi
ner,:; who was killed .by; the accidental
discharge of a shotgun on;Sunday morn-
Ing. I The story that Coroner Bullingtqn
tells; though sad. is interesting in its de
tails of the heroic efforts made to save
the man's life. ; . . ' :
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Johnson was about 18 years of age. His
father is a longshoreman and resides on
Telegraph hill. Ulbrich went out on the
launch only for a pleasure trip. He is a
waiter by occupation and resides at 441
Minna street. Â» *
When, the accident was reported at the
Crowley boathouse another launch, under
the command of Willie Tegari, was sent
out to ' search .for Johnson, but not the
least trace of ' the engineer' or of any
wreckage was found. It is believed that
Johnson perished. . .
About 11:30 o'clock "Johnson and Ulbrich
had the launch just off the Broadway
wharf, where the boathouse is sit
uated, when the Tamalpais bore down
upon them. Owing to tue brÂ«ak in the
machinery , the launch had no lights and
could not be seen by the captain of the
Tamalpais. Both Johnson. and Ulbrich
did the best they could to attract the at
tention of those on board the steamer, but
without avail. The little boat was struck
directly in the middle. Both Johnson and
Ulbrich were thrown into the water. Ul
brich says that he saw Johnson go down.
Although Ulbrich went beneath the
steamer and was struck by the wheel,
he escaped being- drowned. He managed
to get hold of a piece of driftwood and
keep afloat until rescued by a boat from
the Tamalpais. . . ,' .- .
The Socotra -was lying about a mile out
in the bay, directly off the Broadway
wharf. The launch succeeded in reach
ing the British, vessel and in putting the
captain and the merchandise aboard. On
the return trip of the ili-fated little boat
the machinery broke down. Engineer
Johnson . tried to- repair the break, but
without avail. With tne assistance of Ul
brich he attempted to '. propel his craft
back to the boathouse with a plank. This
crude method did not prove very success
ful, and the launch drifted for more than
four hours about the bay.
. The collision between ' the Tamalpais
and the Scout -was the result of an injury
to the launch earlier in the evening. At
about 7 o'clock the launch put off from
the Vallejo-street wharf to put Captain
Hardy of the British bark Socotra aboard
his boat.. Besides Captain Hardy, the
launch carried a quantity of merchandise
for tjie Socotra. . â¢ , :
Â¦â¢ steamer Tamalpais on her return
trip from Sausajito Â¦ last night . at .11:30
o'clock ran down the Scout, a launch be
longing to Thomas Crowiey.-and it is be
lieved that Walter Johnson, the. engineer
QL the little .boat, was â¢ drowned^ Alfred
Ulbrich, a'ybung man who was accom
panying Johnson, had a most miraculous
escape from being killed, by"- the paddle
wheel of the steamer.. When the collision
occurred he was thrown into the water
and passed beneath the steamer. The
huge wheel struck him a slight -glancing
blow just above the right' eye, but did
him no serious injury. A boat was low
ered from the Tamalpais and he was res
cued. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦.. Â¦ , Â¦ ,
. The woman has been arrested time and
again within the past ten years, and this
morning her trial on a charge of grand
larceny will | commence before a jury in
Judge Lawlor's court. She is accused of
stealing $200 from Matthias Michels, a
butcher from Portland, in a saloon on
Kearny street. , . I â¢
"The police -. are persecuting ' me," she
yelled, '"and some one will have to suffer
for it. Take me to the Chief; I must see
him." A friend finally induced her to go
into the elevator and she was taken to
the prison and .booked. In her cell she
continued to rave that the police were
persecuting her. .When asked what she
intended doing' with the revolver she re
plied/she meant it for the officers whom
she alleged were â¢ persecuting her. "They
won't let me alone,"- she said, "and what
can I do?" She made the usual charges
against the officers, which is a habit with
women of her class, but the Chief at
tached no importance to them. â¢
Belle Naylpr, alias Scott, a colored
woman wljo has been arrested several
times for grand larceny . and : vagrancy,
created a email sensation at the Hall of
Justice yesterday afternoon when it was
discovered that she had a loaded revolver
in her possession and was demanding to
see. Chief Wittman. The woman went
into S. Raphael's; store at the corner of
Sacramento and Kearny streets to buy
a revolver, but Raphael refused to sell
her one as she appeared to be. laboring un
der great excitement. She left Raphael's
and crossed the street to, Ladd's gun
store, where she purchased a five-cham
bered revolver and . had it loaded with
cartridges. : The weapon was placed in a
pasteboard box, and she left the store.
Raphael, who was suspicious,' followed
her to the Hall of Justice, and he caught
up with her as she reached the top of the
steps at the entrance. Detective T. J.
Coleman saw him expostulating with her,
and suspecting that sometning was
wrong, Coleman joined the pair. "When
he found that the box contained a'revol
ver he placed the woman under arrest for
carrying a concealed weapon. She de
manded to be <taken to Cnlef "Wittman,
and Coleman took her to- the Chief's of
fice, v/here he was instructed to lock her
up in the city prison. She struggled
fiercely with Coleman and screamed at
the top of her voice while he" began drag*
ging her to the elevator. Â¦'"

The "Hold Up" Mbtj, Coffee.
Few people know how many persons
are made sick and kept sick by coffee
drinking. A trained nurse relates her ex-
perience with a number of different per-
sons. She says, "Quite a long time ago I
discovered that coffee was the cause of
the violent palpitation of iny heart, and
frequent sick headaches, and attacks -of
Indigestion, so I quit coffee ! and - went
onto hot water, not knowing then of Pos-
tum Food Coffee.
"Quite a while after I quit coffee my
husband began to. complain of coffee com-
ing up In his mouth more or less during
the forenoon, and It made it very disagree-
able for him. One day I said, 'Suppose
we try that Postum Food Coffee which Is
advertised so much.' So we did 'and I
prepared It according to. directions. The
beverage f roved delicious and we liked it
eo much and it agreed' with us so well
we have used It for over two years now
"My palpitation of the. heart, headaches
and Indigestion have gone altogether.- it
iÂ«. very easy to make by boiling fifteen
or twenty, minutes with a small piece of
butter put In the pot to prevent its boil-
Ing over. , â¢
"My cousin, who Is a telegraph opera-
tor, had nervous dyspepsia, having to
stay from work every few days. He gave
up the use of coffee .and commenced us-
ing Postura, and Bince that time he has
not been troubled with dyspepsia.
"One woman told me she had suffered
with indigestion for three ; years. -She
drank nothing but tea, I made P-ostum
for her and showed her how to- make It.
She liked it and now uses it In her fam-
ily regularly and Is well and happy.

cases." M. N. Clark, â¢ 222 Ogden . Ave.,

The accident occurred while the cars
v.ere being switched. Yardmaster E. Pot
ter says that somebody must have turneJ
a switch the wrong way. Others give dif
ferent reasons, but the result was the
same, however. The cars took the wrong
track and went calling over the barge
apron before any steps to stop them could
Le taken.
p-r|Â«aHREE Santa Fe freight cars slid
I over the wharf at Main street
jl at 10:30 o'clock Monday night, and
il ' about 510,000 worth of merchan
\ dlse and a chunk of the railroad
company's rolling stock are In need of the
cervices of a diver. The cars contained
vÂ»all paper consigned to Uhl Bros., crock
ery for Nathan, Dohrmann & Co. and
Iron pipe. The cars containing the crock
ery and iron pipe are completely sub
merged. The wall paper car is only part
ly under water. The wrecking operations,
which commenced at daybreak yesterday,
â¢will occupy several days. The cars may
be put into serviceable condition agraln,
but the wall paper is thought to be a
tctal loss and much of the crockery
smashed.

PERSONAL: MENTION;
. The reports of the Weather Bureau show, Chicago
to be the windiest city in the Union, surpassing even
San Francisco in that respect, and yet "there are not
winds enough to .keep the air clear of coal smoke.
According to a' recent statement, "every post
mortem examination of a person who has lived any
length of time in Chicago shows a deposit of coal
dust in -the lungs." What Chicago needs is a breeze
that will whistle through the lungs of.the citizen as
well as through his whiskers. '
Cecil Rhodes'. will is likely to undergo an over
hauling in the -English courts, as a question has
arisen as to the location of his. domicile at the time
the will was made. The will itself declares Rhodes
to have been domiciled in Rhodesia, but it is claimed
there is evidence to prove""he was really domiciled in
England, afrd the Westminster Gazette says: "The
mere statement in the will that he was domiciled in
Rhodesia is of noweight in law* except as' evidence
of his belief that it was so." If 'domiciled in Eng
land the estate will be taxed for death duties, which
will amount to about $800,060, and, what is more im
portant, serious questions will arise under English
law as to the secret trusts, to which a very large
portion of the estate is left. V . C -.\ T."-'-'^V-
What has been done for the bleak, blizzard States
of the Northwest and for the Canadian 'provinces
can be done for California. We have here far bet

not as. cheap land as Manitoba we have vast quanti
ties of land which will yield a better profit to intelli-.

Â¦ At the-present time a vast migratory movement is
under way in the East. /-Thousands of home-seekers
are journeying from the Mississippi Valley to the
Northwest, whence they are overflowing our boun
daries and entering Canada. The movement in
that direction is due to the fact that all the* induce
ments which Montana, North Dakota and Manitoba
can offer to settlers h?ve been elaborately advertised
in the East. The Canadian Government, in particu
lar, has been distributing far and wide reports of the
good opportunities that are afforded for home
seekers :n the western provinces of. the Dominion,
and as a consequence the thoughts of the people are
turned in that direction. The migratory movement
then, is not in any sense a spontaneous one. It has
been carefully worked up and "directed by intelligent
and organized effort. i
A RRANGEMEN.TS â¢ made for the excursion
ZA of San Francisco business men through the

interest taken by many of our leading citizens in the
movement for the upbuilding of Northern Califor
nia. The excursion will of course be a pleasant one,
but it is not for pleasure only that so many of our
business men are going to leave the city and ta'ke
part in the tour. To them the occasion "will be one
of business as well as of pastime. While giving due
attention and appreciation to the scenery along the
route and to the hospitality of the people, Ithey will
not neglect to carefully study "the industrial possi
bilities of the various localities they visit and note
the opportunities offered for the profitable invest
ment of capital. > Â«

George H. Thomas Post, Grand Army
of the Republic, held impressive memo
rial serivces last night in Golden Gate
Hall in memory of those comrades who,
during the last year, were summoned by
the Great Commander to join that ever
increasing throng of veterans whose life
journey has been completed. The hall
was appropriately decorated for the oc
casion. On both sides of the stage were
suspended large American flags and folds
of red, white and blue were draped
around the gallery. The post's colors
were furled and dra*ped in â¢ mourning. A
large number, of Grand Army veterans
were in attendance at the exercises.
General William R. Shatter delivered
an eloquent memorial address, in which
he extolled the loyalty of the Civil War
heroes and praised the United States Gov
ernment for t the care which, it Is taking
of its veteran' soldiers. He described bow
the United State3 is having brought home
the bodies of all soldiers who lost their
lives during the late Spanish war in Cuba
or in the Philippines, so that they may
rest in the family plats or be consigned
to earth in the national cemeteries wher<Â»
their graves will always be kept green
and honor,? paid to their memory. \
He said that the cardinal principles of
the Grand Army constitution were fra
ternity, charity and - loyalty. The first
two, he said, were intended for the ben
efit of the comrades themselves, but the
profession of loyalty is for their country
He said that it .was one of the objects
6t the Grand Army to inspire the youth
of the country Â« with a feeling of loyalty
for its native land, and the great success
which it was encountering in doing this
was well attested by the response with
which the young men meV the Govern
ment's call fbr troops at the breaking out
of the recent war.
TO RECLAIM
CALIFORNIA'S
SWAMP LANDS
"^TWO GENTLEMEN 'WHO ARE
, INTERESTED IN SUCCESS OF
THE BENEFIT. Â¦Â¦'.
The difference between the genuine reform cut
lined in the New York budget and that which is
embodied in the estimates of Auditor Baehr for San
Francisco is .striking. San Francisco has a popula
tion at the last national census of 342,782, while New
York by the same census had a population of 3,437,
212, or approximately ten times the population of
this city. Baehr's estimate for the San Francisco
police force .is $913,172. The reform budget of New
York allows $11,336,830. For our School Depart
ment the Auditor estimates $1,200,000, but that sum
is to include expenditures for permanent improve
ments and a children's playground at North Beach.
The New York budget allows to the Department of
Education $19,223,017. It will be seen that the re
form government in New York gives for education
more than sixteen times as much as we give for
schools with permanent improvements included; and
it also makes nearly aÂ« good a showing in providing
for the police and the protection of the community.
San Francisco cannot afford to lag behind pro
gressive American communities in the work of mu
nicipal development and improvement. The children
of the city are entitled to adequate education and
suitable school buildings and facilities. Ample po
lice protection, clean streets, good hospitals and a
well supported public library are also among the
things the community has a right to expect. It is
the duty of the city authorities to consider' the gen
uine needs of the people in making, up the next tax
levy, and in doing so they should bear in mind they
are going to b.e judged by something more than the
rate of taxation. The people will take note of what
is done for education, streets and public security,
and will not accept parsimony for improvement.
The San Francisco authorities may profitably
study the example that has been set by the adminis
tration of Mayor Low. It teaches that reform does
not mean stinginess nor does economy mean parsi
mony. A good city government will not hesitate to
expend money required for the public good, nor
will the people disapprove of such expenditures if
the disbursements be made with honesty and the
work of the various departments be faithfully per
formed.
Some of the items in which an increase of expendi
ture is given are worth noting. The Tammany esti
mate for the Department of Public Charities was
$1,598,884; the Revised budget allows $1,773,960, or
En "increase of $175,076. For hospitals the 'original
estimate was $462,086, while the revision gives $572,
086, being an increase of $110,000. The estimates for
the Department of Street Cleaning was raised from
$5,176,712 to $5,187,112, an increase of $10,400. For
library purposes the Tammany estimate was $364,
843, while the budget gives $391,543- Thus it will be
seen that in the important works of charity, hospi
tals, street cleaning and public libraries the reform
administration not pnly purposes to give a more
economical and more efficient administration, but al
lows larger expenditures as well.
The revised budget made up by the reform gov
ernment is actually larger than the budget originally
estimated by the Tammany officials. A detailed
statement of the two published in parallel columns
by the Brooklyn Eagle shows that while the Tam
many estimate was for a total expenditure of $94,210,
905, the revised estimates give a total of $94,932,872.
U.NDER the administration of Mayor Low
New York City has entered upon a career of
genuine reform. The estimates which have
been made for the various departments of the gov
ernment show that it is the intention to carry out
reform by doing good work and not by making a
pretense of economy by the practice of parsimony.
Apparently there is to be no stinting of money where
money is needed, and public approval is to be
sought not by making a display of low tax rates, but
by the practice of true economy and the accomplish
ment of beneficial results.
GENUINE REFORM.
THOMAS POST
HOLDS SERVICE
FOR ITS DEAD
The profession has never more willingly
lent its services. Â¦ The institution, which
opened in New York on the first of the
month, appeals to every actor and ac
tress, and they have volunteered with
alacrity. The programme is a long one
and is filled with surprises. Milton Noble*
of the Orpheum, who has arranged it,
states it will take four solid' hours to run
off. Encores will not and cannot be allow
ed. The audience will be treated to vaude
ville, comic opera, tragedy and comedy.
The cleverest people now winning favor
in this city have contributed their best
acts. Every theater will send its best tal
ent. A handsome souvenir programme
will be distributed. The doors will open
at noon, and the performance will neces
sarily begin at 1 o'clock sharp, in order
that the entertainment can be concluded
at 5 p. m. Â¦ I . .Â¦
EVERY seat in the Columbia Theater
will be occupied Thursday after
noon and standing-room will be at
a premium. The benefit entertain
ment in aid of the actors* home
fund has attracted a great deal of atten
tion among local theater-goers. They
have generously , come forward and by
patronizing the coming entertainment will
add many hundreds of dollars to a cause
that is a worthy one.
In the course of .time the . true California will
make itself known. Bret Harte's pictures will
then cease to be harmful misrepresentations. Peo
ple will recognize them for what they are, pictures
of a vanished and romantic class which did not last
long and was never really dominant in the State.
We have in his death to. mourn a brilliant promise
that was unfulfilled, but none the less to rejoice that
he left us so much that is tender, beautiful and true
of the brave days of old. ;
Harte's relations . to California are curious. He
did more to make the State known and to excite
popular interest in :t than any other man, or any
other ten men, for that' matter. His pictures of
California life were universally read and admired,
and it is not too much to say that he formed the
Eastern and European ideals of what Californians
are. It happened, however, that the State rapidly
changed and developed from a mining camp . to a
great and ; highly diversified community, while
Harte's stories presented always the same types of
picturesque figureT*1n wool shirts and high' boots'
ready with the pistol and reckless alike of gold and
blood. Thus in the e^nd his romances did us per
haps more harm than good, and we can hardly agree
that he is so genuinely Californian as the East deems
him.
That there is much in the early writings of Harte
to justify the bright expectations of his admirers is
not to be denied, and many of his short stories will
live among the enduring gems of American letters."
His more ambitious works, however, were.compara
tive failures. After he left California" he did not
grow as was expected. - While he "never at'any time
sank to mediocrity in his writing, he did not
produce anything after he left the State that was
equal to that which he brought , forth while here.
Perhaps had he remained in California and devel
oped with the State itself he might have achieved
far more than he did.
Thus it happened that while in San Francisco he
was not accounted a man of pre-eminent genius, his
success in the East and in Europe was enormous.
During the days' when "The Luck of Roaring
Camp" and "The Heathen Chinee" were new Bret
Harte had a reputation in the East not inferior to
that which Kipling enjoyed in the early days of the
Kipling craze. .There werepeople who declared him
superior to Dickens in his capacity to create char
acters, in his pathos and in his humor. It was
freely predicted that he would write "the great Amer
can novel" and stand forth as a master novelist of
his time.
In the East and in Europe Bret Harte stands as
the distinctively Californian Vvriter, the delineator
of California life and character. He obtained that
reputation early in; his career by his picturesque
stories of the mining camps and the . adventurous
men and women who established them in the days
of the gold excitement. Those stories "and poems,
written in a charming style, with" graphic clearness
and with no little force and skill in the delineation
of certain types of men, were sufficiently infused
with local color to be recognized as genuine pictures
of the mining districts, and yet at the same time ro
mantic enough to please people who had never seen
California even more than they pleased Californians
themselves.
BY the death of Bret Harte American literature
loses a writer who at one time gave promise
of reaching the 'highest eminence .in the
world ofletters. That promise was but inadequately
fulfilled, and yet enough was accomplished to give
him a wider, repute than any other Californian of his
time and obtain for him a recognition abroad as
well as at home. It is therefore a notable man who
disappears from the world, and his loss ' will be
widely mourned on both sides of the Atlantic.
BRET HARTE.
The British Government has been caught trying
to seize a Malay state.' One would think that our
friend John .Bull had. more . than he needed for
awhile at least on the seizing tine. His experience
in South Africa would satisfy an ordinary nation for
d century.
If her Czar would go to school to the Mikado he
could get some lessons in government and in re
spect for the rights of man that would benefit his
people if he had sense enough to apply them.
This minion of a -tyrant, in other words, com
plains of that in the Finns which any other Govern
ment would hail as a sign of soundness and security.
It seems hopeless to expect that Russia's inverted
and pernicious view of life and government will ever
be reformed, except by a revolution which will sweep
Czardom and all her other diseases to destruction.
She lingers unduly on the modern stage. In the
Pacific she assumes offensive airs toward Japan,
when that insular empire is more her superior in
every quality that makes a modern nation than she
is the superior of the Esquimaux of the Lena.
The Finnish Bulletin reports the suppression of a
lafge number of newspapers. Within the last few
weeks one in Viborg was suppressed for good, an
other suspended four months, another three months
and three for two months. Five others have re
ceived warning. The Finnish telegraph, a press as
sociation for supplying news by wire, has been or
dered to cease business. This shuts out from Fin
land all news from the rest of the world. The Bul
letin will not long escape the brutal vengeance which
has overtaken so many of its contemporaries, for it
makes bold to say that these measures are part of
a deliberate policy to suppress freedom of opinion
and prevent the dissemination of news.' General
Kragorodof, a provincial Governor appointed by
General Bobrikof, complains of the bad habit of
reading newspapers, and of their cheapness and
large circulation!
One leading offense most infuriating to Russia was
the free press of Finland. There were more news
papers printed in Finland, in proportion to the
population, than in any other part of Northern
Europe.
All this can have but the reason we assign to it.
The Finns were a living rebuke to the policy of re
pression practiced by Russia. They showed what
men can do for themselves and the world when free,
with their minds not subject to degrading supersti
tions and their personal rights respected. It is not
for their vices that they are cast into slavery, but
for their virtues. They have sinned against the pol
icy of the Holy Synod and the Czar, and 'the man
hood must be scourged out of them with Cossack
whips.
All the liberties of the. people are now under ban.
Their schools are reduced to the level of the rest of
Russia. Public spirit has become a crime. The
country is garrisoned by Cossacks. The people are
commanded to use the Russian language and are
even whipped for their slow acquisition of that bar
barous tongue. Where recently was happiness there
is misery. â¢ Discontent has taken the place of con
tentment, and the blight and curse of Russian au
tocracy, ignorance, superstition and tyranny rest
upon a land but recently "the most contented in Eu
rope.
' Abrogation of the treaty was purely arbitrary and
tyrannical. It was made by an ancestor of the Czar
and has been faithfully observed by his house until
now. ThÂ«re existed no reason" for its arbitrary
withdrawal. The Finns are an orderly people, not
ill disposed toward the empire, , and offending, if at
all, only through their system- . of education, their
general intelligence and enjoyment of freedom. It
may well be that these things are offensive to Rus
sia, where education is" repressed/ students are mur
dered by Cossack soldiery, and the country is held
back in the jjrim grip of a medieval, civilization by
denying tc the people the means of progress which
have been used by the Finns, and " have developed*
other parts of Europe. One can .see why the Czar
should desire to remove a good example beyond the
sight of his people, and should therefore striRe down
education, progress and manhood, preceding his
ghastly act by the" dastardly "withdrawal of a solemn
treaty. . 1
RUSSIAN policy toward Finland is illustrative*
of what comes upon a people when they are
ruled by arbitrary power. The Czar has set
aside the ancient treaty which guaranteed the auton
omy of Finland, and by a series of most oppressive
acts 'has attempted to minister to the Finns the
same treatment that has niade Russia odious - to
Poland. ;^ ; > ..-..Â¦ ;Â¦ ''"' . Â¦ " '

The excursion to the San Joaquin will enable our
business men.to see for themselves the richness of
the land and the magnificent resources that await de
velopment. They will thus be given a new enthu
siasm in the movement to bring settlers into the
State and at the same time they will have attained a
better knowledge of how to go about the work. On
the other hand, the residents of the San Joaquin will
get acquainted with the business men of the city and
learn how willingly San Francisco will co-operate
with every local effort for improvement and ad

to hosts alike, and there can be. little doubt the ex
cursion will be^so successful that it will be followed
by many similar ones in the near future.

REPUBLICAN
PARTY LEADERS
DISCUSS PLANS
The sub-committee of the Republican
State Executive Committee, which was
recently charged With the duty fcf pre
paring the general features of a call for
the nominating convention of the party,
will soon be ready to present a report. It
is understood that the committee will rec
ommend Sacramento as the place, and
Monday, September 1, as the time for
holding the convention. As the State
Fair opening has been postponed until
September 9, the pavilion at Sacramento
can be used for convention purposes dur
ing the first week of that month. The
Democrats will probably hold their con
vention to . nominate State officers some
time between the 20th and 30th of August.
Democratic leaders remark that Sacra
mento is not the only convention city of
the State, and that the pavilion of the
State Agricultural Society is not the only
convention hall in California. This year,
owing to the lateness of the Republican
convention, the Democrats may be forced
to put their ticket in the field before the
Republican delegates assemble. Many
Democratic leaders favor San Francisco
as a place of meeting. The fact is re
called that Governor Irwin was nominat
ed at Union Hall, Governor Bartlett at
Odd Fellows' Hall, and Governor BudcT
at the Baldwin Theater of this city. Gov-~
ernor Stoneman was nominated at San
Jose. San Francisco Is the luckiest of
all the places for the Democrats.
Accounts received by The Call from va
rious sections of the State are to the ef
fect that the Gage machine cannot elect
a sufficient number of delegates) to orga
nize the Republican convention, hence no
surprise would be created if the Gage or
gans should come Into line for Lieutenant
Governor Neft for chairman. The stal
wart forces of the Republican party now
engaged In the battle for good govern
ment and clean politics would prefer that
the bosses should disclose the name* of
their candidate for the chairmanship, but
the manipulators in the boss camp are
afraid to submit the issue to the people.
The Republican voters of the State, how
ever, will name the chairman of the con
vention at the primary^ elections on
August 12. As it seems to be generally
settled that Gage caimot win the fight for
renomination. the politicians are begin
ning to speculate concerning the second
choice of the machine forces. Gage will
probably favor some gubernatorial as
pirant dwelling In Northern or Central
California, so as to make affairs a little
smoother for a Senatorial candidate from
the south.

The Market Street and Eureka Valley

tition says that the parlc is the rendez

recently a footpad made his escape by
taking refuge within the deep shadows of
the park's bushy lanes and trails. Soma
one proposes to build an observatory in
the park, and the club suggests that the
upper part be used as a temperance re

Dispute With Building
Trades Council .Is
Brotherhood Openly Defies
the Action of Master
Builders.
. The troubles between the members of
the United Brotherhood of Carpenters
and Joiners and the Â¦ Building Trades
Council threaten to develop into a serious
muddle unless one or the other side backs
down gracefully. At 'present both fac
tions are defiant and members of either
organization look for an open rupture at
an early date. . , :^-'^
At a meeting of /the Master Builders
last night a resolution was. adopted sus
taining the Building Trades Council~in
its controversy with Carpenters' Union
No. 483. This union insisted upon holding
its membership In the Labor Council and
when the Building Trades Council de
manded that it withdraw, from the Labor
Council it declined to do so. The result
was that it severed | its connection with
the Building Trades Council, and the
opening gun in the war was fired.
When the District Council of the.broth
erhood heard of the action taken by "the
Master Builders, a resolution of defiance
"was immediately adopted.. The following
notice to the brotherhood was issued, ar.a
it is important in that- it calls upon
members to quit work on any building
should one of the brotherhood ' bÂ« dis
charged â¢ because of the dispute . now on
between the rival organizations:
To All Members of the Brotherhood of Car
penters: At a meeting of the District Council
held on this date a resolution was adopted In
structing members not to be guided by any ac
tion taken by the so-called conference of build
ers held on this date, and that we Â¦- do not
recognize - the right of any builders' organiza
tion to force locals of the brotherhood to take
action In violation of Its laws;
You are Instructed In case of the discharge
of any member of the brotherhood on account
of said builders to immediately cease work on
any building on which you may be employed
and Â¦ report at headquarters.
The council received a letter from Pres
ident W; D. Huber of the United Brother
hood of Carpenters and Joiners of Amer
ica calling upon them to remain firm in
their atitude against the Building Trades
Council. He said that the laws of the
brotherhood must be adhered to, and he
expressed regret that- Carpenters' Union
No. 22, to which . P. H. McCarthy of the
Building Trades Council belongs, shows
a disposition to run the entire machine.
The District Council was assured that the
rank and file of the brotherhood was with
the San- Francisco members in their fight
for independence.
Delegate D. Hupp of the District Coun
cil, who a member of Carpen-ters'
Union No/** 304, Said last night that his
union had withdrawn from the Building
Trades Council because the officers of
that body "persisted in hounding all
members who remained *- faithful to the
United Brotherhood." This leaves two
unions which are still affiliated with the
Building Trades Council, and it is ex
pected they will soon withdraw from that
body. "
The Building Trades Council last night
issued a statement in connection with the
adjustment of the dispute between the
material teamsters and contractors, Mn
which it says that the contractors were
perfectly willing to meet - the teamsters
half way on all their demands, and that
they showed a commendable spirit in the
negotiations which ended in a fair ad
justment of the controversy.. The con
tractors, did not oppose the demand for
more wages, because they believed that
the . demand was just and should be
gTanted. The result is harmony of action
between contractors . and teamsters. '

"ADVERTISEMENTS.
A Most Remarkable Remedy That
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor ,
to. Men.
A Free Trial E^ckacre Sent by Ma}l
to All V/ho Write.
Free trial packages of a most remarka-
ble remedy are being, mailed to all who
â¢will write to the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years against the mental and
physical sufferings of lost manhood that
the institute has decided.to distribute free
trial packaaes to all who write. It Ik a
home treatment and all men who suf-
fer from any form of sexual weakness
resulting from youthful folly, premature
loss of strength and memory, weak back,
varlcocele or emaciation of parts can
now cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act di-
rect to the desired location, giving
strength and development Just where it
is needed.' It cures all the ills and ttou-
bles that come from years of misuse of
the natural functions and has been an
absolute success in all cases. A request
to the State Medical Institute, 32S Eiek-
tron building. Fort V/ayne, Ind., mat-
ing that you desire one of their free trial
packages, will be complied with prompt-
ly. The institute is desirous of reaching
that great class of men who are un-
able" to leave home to. be treated, and
the free samples will enable them to see
how easy it is to be cured of sexual
weakness when the proper remedies are
employed. The institute makes no restric-
tions. Any man who writes will be sent
a free sample, carefully sealed in a. plain
package, so that its -recipient need have
no fear of embarrassment or publicity.
Readers are requested to write -without
delay.' ' . ; : ..

American stocks have been the feature. At
first the local business, was very restricted
with prices simply firm, but In the afternoon
New York started a strong upward sweep, with
the coalers leading. Private cables I say that
the strike in the mining region Is likely to be
averted. Reading was strong on rumors that
the company had arranged terms with Its em
ployes. Louisville and Nashville is blazing
the way on talk of being put on a six per cent
dividend . basis in â¢ July and Union Pacific is
talked to 150 on the expectation of a similar
dividend action.. Canadian < Pacific bulged in

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. May 6. â The stock market
made a. remarkable showing of recuperative
powers to-day. Yesterday's nervous disturbance
growing out of the collapse of the Webb- Meyer
group of stocks was freely lacking from the
outset to-day. That development, in fact,
seemed to be accepted as highly beneficial.
Immense relief was professed over the weeding
out which had been accomplished of an inflated
group of securities whose precarious condition
must have remained a menace to the market
as long as it existed. The collapse of an infla
tion is always a hazardous operation, owing to
the danger of the sentimental effect, however
strictly localized. The effect Is inevitably to'
shake the fabric of credit, and endanger sound,
properties as well as the products of manipula
tion. The firmness with which the market took
the shock was a surprise to the more confident
observers. The effect was manifested in the
opening dealings, where large buying orders
appeared well distributed throughout the list.
After yesterday's test confidence has not been
eo general in the soundness of the market posi
tion for many weeks as It was to-day. The
money rate continued stiff at 10 per cent, at
which rate large sums were loaned by the
banks, and the rate receded only after most of.
the demand was satisfied. The maintenance of
the money rate, however, was believed to be a
symptom of the pressure exercised. by the banks
against extending credits for undesirable spec
ulative purposes. The belief is general that the
recent liquidation had greatly strengthened the
position of the banks and has added much to
the soundness of the whole fabric of credits.
To-day's Clearing-house exchanges were re
ported as $500,430,954. Only on four previous
occasions, all of them. -during 1901, have the
New York exchanges exceeded half a billion
dollars for a single day. No large . syndicate
transactions are known to have figured in the
result, Â¦which may be taken, therefore, as a
measure of the amount of liquidation accom
plished on Friday and Saturday in the stock
market. The transfer of $400,000 by telegraph
to New Orleans was an incident of the day.
Aside from the natural revulsion of sentiment
due to the appreciation that yesterday's anxie
ties were unduly acute assurance . was felt in
the financial district that means had been found
to avoid a strike by the anthracite miners. The
coalers were natuarlly prominent in the vigor
ous upward movement. The movement in Louis
ville and Nashville, Chicago, Indianapolis and
Louisville and Illinois Central gave color to the
rumors of the extension of the Louisville to
Chicago and the establishment of a commercial
unity among the Southern trunk lines. An
unusually favorable batch of fourth week rail
road earnings reported by Southern and South
western railroads, . and further .rains in the
Southwestern States, stimulated the report.
The answer filed by the Northern Securities
Company to the Government's brief was favor
ably regarded , in Wall street as an argument
from the financial side of the device of securi
ties-holding companies, and prompted some
buying of stocks available for mergers. This
was notably the case with the Chicago, Great
Western stock. The strength of the market,
however, was quite universal and gains of as
much as 1 to 3 points are . common 1 throughout
the list. The /market closed active and strong
at about the top.
The bond market shared in the tendency to
ward recovery of stocks. . Total- sales, $3,305,
000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. _ -..-_>..,

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
director cf the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weather has continued cool In all parts
cf the State until near the close of the week,
and light rain has fallen in the central and
northern sections. Fcgs have prevailed along
the southern coast. No injurious frosts have
occurred. .
Grain is making good growth and is in ex
cellent condition in all sections, except portions
of the south and in parts of San Benito Coun
ty. Wheat and barley are rapidly heading out
in the great valleys, and. give indications of
an unusually heavy yield; the crop will be light
in the south, and possibly a failure if rain does
not come soon. Hay harvest is progressing,
and good crops are the rule in all sections. The
first crop of barley In the San Joaquin Valley
is reported heavy, but of inferior quality.
Potatoes, hops and sugar beets are thrifty, but
needing rain in some places.
Prunes are being seriously injured by blight
in. portions of Sonoma and Santa Clara coun
ties, and the crop will be very light in those
places. Tulare County pears are also being in
jured by blight. There are several reports of
deciduous fruits dropping, mainly prunes,
pears and apricots, but as the trees were heav
ily laden it is probable there will be a good
yield of nearly a.11 varieties. Vineyards, wal
nuts and citrus fruits are thrifty.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â The weather con
tinued cool and cloudy during the first part
of the week, but higher temperatures prevailed
Kt the close. Light rain fell on Tuesday and
Wednesday. There were no injurious frosts.
Haying will commence during the present week,
and a heavy crop is expected. Grain contin
ues in excellent condition, and in some sec
tions it is predicted the yield of wheat and
barley will be the largest ever harvested.
Orchardists are spraying and thinning fruit.
French prunes and pears are dropping to some
extent in Yolo County, but the crop will prob
ably be heavy. Dtoiduous fruits are reported
superior in quality and of large size, and orch
arcjists expect good markets. Cherries are be
ing fchipptd in considerable quantities from
Vacaville.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â Cool weather
continued until near the close of the week,
and light rain fell in the central and northern
portions Tuesday and Wednesday. Frosts oc
curred in some of the northern districts, but
were too light to injure fruits or vegetables.
Grain, hay and feed are In good condition. In
the northern and central districts there will
be heavy orope of grain, but in Sen Benito and
other southern coast counties the yield will
probably be below average, owing, it is said,
to cold weather and scarcity "of the early rains.
Good crops of hay pre now being harvested.
Hops and vegetables are in good condition.
There is a probability of a very light yield
of prunes in portions of Santa Clara, Sonoma
and other counties, and as no Injurious frosts
have occurred this season, orchardists are un
able to explain the shortage, though some at
tribute the blight to late rains. Other deciduous
fruits give promise of full crops, with the ex
ception of apricots in a few places.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.â The weather has
been generally clear and warm during the day,
with cool nights, and light rain has fallen
from Fresno northward, greatly benefiting grain
and pasturage. Wheat and barley are rapidly
heading out. and good crops are probable in
nearly all the central and northern counties,
though barley is reported light in Merced Coun
ty. .Haying is progressing In all sections; the
first crop of alfalfa, is reported heavy, but of
inferior quality. Pasturage is plentiful, and
stock are in good condition. Small fruits have
commenced to ripen in the viojnity of Reedley.
Apricots and peaches ! are dropping In some
localities, but fair crops are expected. Blight
is injuring pears in Tulare County, and the
yield will be light. Other deciduous fruits are
in good condition, and vineyards are thrifty
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Cool weather
ha* continued during the week, and fogs have
prevailed along the coast, benefiting growing
crops. Dryir-K winds in some sections have
been unfavorable for late grain. Hay cutting

Chicago opened firmer on light receipts and
firm cables and the market advanced from
74%c to 75%c. There were some small foreign
acceptances and Bradstreet's decrease in stocks,
given above gave the market a very firm tone,
it being the opinion that stocks would clean
up. There were 215,000 bushels worked for
export and there was a good shipping demand.
The weather over the wheat belt continues
to improve. There are general rains from the
British line to the Gulf. Nebraska has been
thoroughly soaked and Kansas reports general
rains, except a light fall in the central coun
ties which are the great wheat area. Taking
theState as a whole there is now a possibil

prices they would rather sell It than pack , it,
but the excessive supply forces them to the
latter course. Prices remain unchanged. ' â¢
The situation in Cheese remains as befpre
quoted, the market being plentifully supplied
and weak.
Eggs are quoted firm and most dealers re
port 19c for the finest ranch, though the figure
is extreme and somewhat of a squeeze. There

Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New York say
"The feeling in all lines continues quiet,
the market presenting some easiness on a few
cf the more important descriptions. The move
ment is mainly jobbing In character, buyers
r.pparently not being disposed to purchase in
excess of actual consuming outlet. Prunes are
steady, but more disposition is shown by hold
ers to move goods as the storage season ap
proaches. This applies particularly to old
prunes, the market being irregular as to qual
ity and condition of the fruit, and somewhat
in favor of buvers. We hear of occasional job
bing business in C0-70s. 70-SOs and 80-90s at
less than inside quotations. Small fruit is
pressing for sale at somrÂ«.ha.t easy figures. The
market on old fruit is difficult to quote. For
new prunes the pressure of offerings of oid
has affected the situation somewhat. On 40-50s
fc-anta Claras in 25-!b. boxes ti?sc is the gen
oral view, though reports of sales at less
money are heard. Other sizes take the usual
range below the 40-5Cs basis. Reports of dam
age to the new crop in Santa Clara Valley
heard yesterday were discredited by wire this
morning. Oregon prunes" are fairly steady.
"In currants the spot market Bhows more
f4ea<iineÂ£s with 4%c quoted on fine Amalias In
barrels. The demand, however, is light, an
occasional lot being reported sold around quo
tations. Advices from the primary market re
port the situation a efcade firmer.
""In raisins the movement and demand for
California loose and see3ed are dull. Prices are
somewhat nominal. Layer Valencias ehow
sÂ«ome firmness and a Jobbing movement at
7%c. Spot peaches are a little firmer and In
fair request. Apricots arc also steadier with
Â«=tocks of both descriptions in strong hands.
In dates vie note a moderate demand. Stocks
are cleaning up and the principal holders are
holding firmly. Ftps, layers in 10-lb. boxes, are
scarce and firm. In nuts Brazils are reported
Fteacy at 4%c to 4%c on medium and largÂ».
Some buying" is heard of. Western ideas are
bflow the market in many cases. For walnuts
Naples continue firm. Shelled almonds are
fairly steady and show a Jobbing interest."

CHICAGO, May 6.â Trade in wheat was
largely, the kind of affair that might be expect
ed after thV considerable slump on' the burial
of the drought scare. " The. natural inclination
was to figure on a reaction, and when cables
showed no response to our slump, .but rather
improved, and receipts showed a marked fall
ing off, prices opened somewhat higher. The
big influence, however," was .a new weather
scare in the news of delayed spring seeding In
the Northwest because of -the excessive rains.
The ground in the Northwest is reported veri
table ponds, with the rains still falling. The
bulls seized on ! this, argument I to emphasize
the probability of a great decrease in the spring
wheat acreage, i Northwestern receipts were
very small and the outside markets showed
good strength. Additional bullish . incentives
were Broadstreefe". report of a decrease of
6,974,000 bushels in the* world's available sup
ply and the decrease of 2,400,000 bushels in the
European. visible, i The cash situation here im
proved when prices broke yesterday and local
sample -men reported eight loads taken here
for direct shipment to Europe. These factors
influence holders of wheat to retain their own
ings. There was Â¦ practically, no - pressure to
sell stuff at any time, either for short accounts
or for liquidation. Trade in general, however,
was rather quiet, without prominent features.
Bulls, were cautions. July^ started %@%c to
a shade up, at.75%@75c, advanced to 75%@
75%c and closed .flinv %c higher, at 75%@
75 %c. The copious rains which. have been so
much needed ..in the Southwest had; been large
ly discounted yesterday and their bearish effect
was offset to-day by the number of bullish in
fluences. :"'Â¦Â¦' , '
Corn showed marked strength In the face of.
bearish news. Firmer cables started the early
upturn and wheat strength" added , to the pit
situation. One cause of an absence of selling
pressure was that yesterday's break shook out
most of .the' available stuff and deterred any
response to to-day's bearish news. Â¦Â¦ July closed
strong, l@l%c up, at 61%c.
. Good , business'. in' cash' oats and sympathy
with the advance in corn and wheat resulted
in only a fair trade in oats. July closed %c
higher at 35%c.
Provisions ruled weak. The hog situation
was weaker and influenced the pit and out
siders sold liberally. â¢ July pork closed 15c
lower. July lard 7%@10c down, and ribs 2%
@5c lower. '
The leading futures ranged as follows : j

, In 1S70 ; Harte : was appointed professor
of recent, literature In the University of

Chicago, but failed. He then accepted a
nominar position on the Atlantic Monthly
at a large salary, which he drew for two
years but did very little work.
Bret Harte never returned to California,
and in recent years lived abroad. In 1878
he was appointed United States Consul at
Crefeld, Germany, and In 1S80 was trans
ferred to Glasgow, Scotland,' where he re
mained until v 1885,'. when having a suf
ficient income from his works he retired
from active work and devoted himself to
literature.
Bret Harte depicted things and men as
he saw them, and few writers of any day
are more vigorous or veracious In- por
trayal. ; He was a slow worker, but In his
time turned out much that will live long
and little that is not worth living. Among

Mrs. Albert Baer gave an informal tea

His natural tendencies in due time be
came too pressing to be longer unheeded.
He wrote a story, ''M'llss," which was
published in the Golden Era and attract
ed much attention, that of Starr â¢ King
among others/ who, calling at the 1 office
and learning the Identity of the author,
advised that he be taken from the case :
and put at a desk. After "M'llss" came
other sketches and- hla "Condensed Nov
els.", but none was so good as "M'llss."
His name, however, had begun to attract
attention, and by some one's favor Jn 1863
he was made secretary of the branch mint
in this city, a political sinecure, which he
held for six years. He continued writing
during this time and put out "John Burns
of- Gettysburg," "The Pliocene Skujl,"
"The . Society Upon the ; Stanislaus" . and
other stories. Then came "The Luck of
Roaring Camp," by which his fame began
to grow and with it the reputation and
circulation of the' Overland, In which it:
was published and of which he was then
editor. .Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦,
, Soon' after "The Luck" came !'The -
Heathen Chinee." , This fixed his fame as
a. writer and? humorous poet. "Truthful
James" and- "Bill' Nye" became persons
of national' reputation, and Bret Harte's
name was on everybody's tongue. >.;;.
Bret Harte said once: ", 'The Heathen
Chinee' Vwas Iwritten for the ; Overland
After the; pedagogic effort for several
years, as he himself expressed it, he
"wandered about California, from city to
camp and camp to city, without any spe
cial purpose." He did. anything that fell
to his hand in order to make his living.
Finally he learned to set type, and. after
working, on papers in Eureka and other
country places, In 1857 , returned to San
Francisco and found work, at his newly
adopted vocation on the Golden Era. '
There-he worked for some time, in em
bryo, as it were. It was a sort of prelude
to the development into the higher sphere
in which he was to win fame and for
tune. When he was only, 11 years of age
he * had written a little poem entitled
"Autumn Musings," which he sent to the
New York Sunday Atlas. It was accept
ed and published. He showed it to his
parents, but only to be discouraged from
any future attempts in that direction for
a long time. 'â¢
He gave up all poetical aspirations, yet
did not find anything else that suited hi3
bent. It was better so, for persistence in
that direction would have doubtlesa lost
him the opportunities for observation â¢ of
nature and natural men that he. en joyed
in his years of wandering in the campj
arid Â¦ sierras of California. - â¢ Â¦ \
i With pick and Â¦ shovel ; he sought the
"color," / but after some months of, for
him, hard and disappointing work he
gaveit up. He next took the place- as
Wells-Fargo messenger of a man who had
been shot a few days before. This posi
tion he held for some months, and then
started a school, in Sonora, which had by
that time ..become' -quite ; a town. . The
school was a failure and he left It. _ '

to do for a few months in the first half
of 1853, and then started for the gold

GIVES DINNER
IN HONOR OF
HER FRIEND
We are also* to have a telegraph station on
the Farallon Islands. This Is a matter In
whleh The Call has taken a deep Interest, and
I am pleased to say that the agricultural ap
propriation bill, which passed the House a
week ago, carried the sum of $40,000 for this
purpose. If cables are to be used, or $3000 it
wireless telegraphy Is to be Installed. Â¦Â¦
It was a matter of great regret to ua that
no member from the "West was en thÂ« co.n
fcrence committee In either house of Con
gress. Of course. that was largely due to thÂ»
make-up of the committees from which the
conferees were chosen. Under ths custom that
prevails in Congress the conferees are gener
ally taken from the committee which originally
reports the bill. Mr..Flatt of Connecticut was
put on the % conference committee In tne sen
ate, although not a member of the Commit
tee on Immigration, which ortgtnally
the bill. This was a radical departure from
the usual rule and Senator Frye In making the
appointment of confreres on the part Â¦ of the
Senate referred to the matter at tfcat time,
saying that in view of the attitude of the Sen
ate In adopting the Platt substitute he deemed
it to be the desire of the Senate to have Senator
Platt in the conference. No word of PÂ«Â«e"
was raised against this procedure and tnat is
how Senator Platt came to be one of the con-
C The' bill as finally passed continues all the
existing laws in force until otherwise provided
by law! It extends those lawa to our Insular
1-Sssesslona and prohibits the i"â¢Â»n*JÂ£Â»Â«Â£
Chinese laborers from those insular possessions
the mainland and from one i^ular posses
sion to another. It also Provides for the regis

TO CKEATE NEW/ STATES.
I expect to hurry back to "Washington to
cast my vote In favor of the bill to create the
States of Arizona. New Mexico and Oklahoma
I am in hearty favor of its P&Â»sa*e It will
mean the election of six additional United
States Senators from the West. U seems to xna
that our people at this time are Interested In
seeing men elected who will etand by "Western
Interests. No matter what the political faith
of the new Senators may be, it is certain that
whenever any Western Interest will be af
fected they will stand for the protection of
those Interests. ...
I am glad to say that we will secure a new
custom-house for.. San Francieco In the near
future The House has already appropriated
$100,000 for thlÂ« purpose and this amount will
be materially increased by the Senate. The
new structure will occupy the site of the pres
ent building. I had an interview with Mr.
Taylor, the supervising architect of the Treas
ury, Just before I came away with- a -view
toward securing the use of California materials
in the construction of the new building. Mr.
Taylor assured roe that preference would ba
given to California building material and that
in all likelihood the new structure will be of
granite. - -
Indeed the State has fared very well In the
matter of appropriations for public Improve
ments. Although the entire amount appro
priated by the House bill aggregated $16,000.
000, California gets over one-sixteenth of the
total amount. The amount appropriated for
river and harbor improvements is also very
considerable. - - -
Mr. George Edward Raum, the kind-hearted,
disinterested friend, who has applied for letters
of I guardianship, "just to protect Mr. Flnlay
son's estate from robbers and designing people
by the strong 1 arm of the law," informed me
this evening that he never had been interviewd
by a reporter about- Mr. Finlayson's affairs
until last evening at San Rafael, and then was
asked but two questions, and further said that
he bad never told any one that Miss Ingarglola
had demanded Finlayson's keys at the Hotel
Rafael, or that she had ever claimed to be his
niece or any of the other statements published
concerning her. . A. C. BARRY.
Editor of The Callâ Sir: I desire to call
your attention to an article that appeared in
this morning's Issue of The Call about the
sickness of James ; Finlayson in which this
statement appears: ' .
. "Last week 'Countess' Ingargiola callea at
the Hotel Kaf ael and claimed she was Fin
layson's niece. She demanded the key to his
strong box and Informed the hotel manager
that she would have â¢ her 'uncle' removed to
her home in San Francisco. The hotel man
ager refused to give the woman . the key to
the box, and attending physicians declined to
allow tie sick man to be moved from his
rooms: . Â¦". Â¦ . .
"The ; 'Countess' then declared that Finlay
son had made a will in her favor, and that
A. C. Barry, claiming to be an attorney and
who resides In her flat at 9Q5 .Eddy street,
had drawn It."
I desire to Bay that this statement is ab
solutely false. The article further states that
the 'woman calling herself Countess Ingarglola,
who stftted last week that she was a niece
of Finlayson, is now keeping in hiding. This
statement is untrue, as are a number of other
statements and insinuations of the writer of
th.} articles here referred ' to. A brief state
ment of facts in this case Is as follows:--,-
Mr. James Finlayson has been an intimate
friend of mine for the past fourteen years, and
for a portion of the time has lived In the same
house where I made my home. I have acted as
his legal adviser In most of hlsbuslness trans
actions where legal advice seemed to be nec
essary. Since he has been residing at San
Rafael I have seen him almost every day at
his office or place of business in this city. As
soon as I was notified of his present Bickness
I immediately went to .see him at the Hotel
Rafael, In San Rafael, and found him almost
wholly unconscious; and learned from his physi
cian and the people at the hotel that he was
found in his room In that condition. I He has
all the care and attention from the hotel man
agers that could be given to any one, besides
the constant attention of a very competent pro
fessional nurse, and thÂ« best medical service
: and skill that could be obtained. I with many
of- his friends from this city called to see him
quite often, with no othe'r motives than kind
ness and disinterested friendship. Among his
callers was Miss Ingarglola, who had been well
acquainted with him for years, and was In the
I habit of calling him Uncle Jamea. as Mrs. Nel
j eon and other ladles often did, but Miss In-'
I gargiola never claimed to be his niece, nor did
she ever tell any one that she was. Miss In
garglola never demanded Mr. Flnlayson's keys
or anything else that belonged to him. . " â¢
The following communication has been
received from A. C. Barry in connection
with the affairs of Jamea Finlayson, the
aged capitalist, who is lying at the point
of death at the Hotel Rafael in San Ra

WHY FLATT "WAS CHOSEN.
Julius Kahn, Congressman from tna
Fourth District, sllppeu quietly into Ibo
city last Sunday night. He kept hia pres
ence a. secret in order that he might have
a needed rest and enjoy the society of his
family. He stated last night that he camÂ©
home to see Julius- Jr. and his mother
and he found them both doing well. He
further said he was not here to transact
business and would depart immediately
for Washington.
In discussing matters of interest to resi
dents of this State, Congressman Kahn
gave some interesting facts. He spoko
especially about the Chinese exclusion
bill, in which he took an active interest,
saying: ,Â«.,.:. "--
While the bill that passed ultimately was
not all that the Pacific Coast members desired
it was the very best that could be obtained
under the circumstances. There was no diffl
culty in -passing the Mil that was wanted by
the people of California through thÂ« House, but
the Senate insisted that the existing lawa
should be continued. As a matter of fact tne>
so-called Mltchell-Kahn bill was practically tha
codification of the existing laws, treasury regu
lations and present practices. In the latter
bill the existing lawa were continued in ex
press language. The Senate bill simply con
tinues them by reference. The members ofthe
California delegation made a strong effort to
secure the retention of the seamen's clause la
the Senate bill, but without avail. In. view oC
the short time that was left within which to
secure an agreement the House conferee3
finally yielded this point, because they did not
want to assume the responsibility of having
the bill fail altogether.

can Officers.
Letters Indicate That Action
in Venice Was an
Outrage.
LONDON, May 6.â Private letters from
Home give a very different complexion to
the arrest of the American naval officers
at Venice. They say that instead of
thanking the King of Italy for the clem
ency in pardoning the officers, the United
States should demand an apology.
A correspondent writes that when Unit
ed States Embassador George \ r on Meyer,
first heard the news he was "inclined to
let justice follow its course," but on sec
ond thought he was touched by the prob
able ruin of the future careers of the
officers and therefore approach
"ed the Foreign Minister to arrange mat
ters if possible. ..>
The action of the American Consul at
Venice, Henry A. Johnson, was much
criticized by some people, as showing
â¢want of tact;" but. according to reports
which have now arrived here, he acted
in the most energetic manner and with
proper backing would have had the offi
cers returned to their ship.
A correspondent writes that when the
Consul was summoned in a hurry after
the fight he energetically protested
against the arrest of the officers and de
manded their immediate removal on
board the Chicago. The Italian author
ities, however, would not yield the point.
The Consul's failure to exercise * - tact"
seems, according to the correspondence
from Rome, to have been failure to "of
fer immediately adequate pecuniary com
pensation for the damage done and to
those who were wounded in the fight."
?'PING-PONG ANKLE"
OUR VERY IiATEST WOE
LONDON, May 6.â "Ping-pong ankle" Is
the latest companion to "tennis elbow."
The medical name is tenosynovitis, and It
hurts much.
An account of a case of "ping-pong an
kle" is gi\*en prominence in the British
Medical Journal. The patient had consid
erable swelling of the left leg above the
ankle*. The swelling subsided after a day
passed in bed. An examination showed
acute inflammation of the Bheaths, of the
tendons connected with the muscles
avound the shin. The attendant ascribed
the suffering to the results of pins-pong
playing, and he wrote to .the Medical
Journal, warning players that the game
involves a great strain on the shin bone
and muscles, and until a costume and
footgear appropriate to the popular sport
is evolved the disease is likely to fre
qvently occur.
DEATH STAYS THE VIRILE PEN
OF WORLD =FAMED BRET HARTE
Celebrated Author, Whose Stories of the Pioneer Days in California
Brought Him Prominence in \ Literature and a Fortune,
Passes Away Suddenly at His- 'English Home in Camberley
POPE DEPLORES
PRELATE'S DEATH
Passing of Archbishop
Corrigan Grieves the
Pontiff.
Body Will Lie in State in
the Cathedral in
;V New York.
The Westminster Gazette remarks:
"The world has lost one of the most be
loved of its-writers."
â¢ "His work." says the Pall Mall Gazette,
"was the common property of the Anglo-
Saxons on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Except a little cold," said Harte, "I
have no ailments or complaints. While I
am getting to be a pretty old man" (point
ing to his snow-white hair) "there is life
in the old dog yet," and thereupon he lit
a cigar so large that it would have done
credit to any of his P.oker Flat friends;
He was hoping, he also said, to do more
work, but he confessed he was growing
lazy.
The afternoon papers make very sym
pathetic comments on the death of Bret
Harte.%
Harte had been living in England for,
years. Most of his time was spent in the
country, and when, in. London he was al
most secluded, having few visitors to' his
rooms at Lancaster Gate, and only going
to the houses of a limited number of very
intimate friends. Several months ago,
when a false report of his death was cir
culated in America, a correspondent called
at his rooms. 'â¢ Harte then appeared to â¢ be
perfectly well.- He laughed heartily and
quoted Mark Twain's old saying about
the report being. greatly exaggerated.
Harte had been suffering from swelled
tonsils since December, last, but . did . not
consider the attack to be serious. A week
ago he went Jto visit friends at Camber
ley and was present at Funch, as usual,
yesterday. He suddenly became ill in the
afternoon, went to bed and died in a few
hours. His end was peaceful.
LONDON, May Câ F. Bret Harte,
the American author, died sud
denly last night at Red House,
Camberley, near Aldershot, .from
hemorrhage, caused by an affec
tion of the throat. ' ,
Francis Bret Harte, though one of the
first Californians to achieve wide fame
as an author and whose inspiration and
material for his best works was gathered
among her hills and canyons, was not a
native of this State. He was born in Al
bany, N. Y., August 25, 1839, of English-
German parents. Hebrew blood was
mixed in his veins. His father was a lit
erary man and a- professor of Greek in
the .Albany Female College. Young
Harte, , though not fond of hard study,
inherited some of his father's taste for
reading, and had early absorbed a num
ber of such books as Froissart's "Chronl-
Many Celebrated Stories.

NEW YORK, May 6.â The arrangements
for the funeral of Archbishop Corrigan
are being rapidly completed. The body
will lie in state in the cathedral from 11
o'clock to-morrow until 11:30 Friday. Be
ginning to-morrow, a guard of honor, con
sisting of members of the Sixty-ninth
Regiment, the Knights of Columbus, Holy
Name" Society, Catholic Benevolent As
sociation and other Catholic organizations
will stand watch over the body in the
cathedral. There will also be representa
tive Catholic citizens such as John D.
Crimmins and W. Bourke Cockran, who
will act as a guard of honor.
Throughout the city to-night meetings
were heid by numerous Catholic societies
for the purpose of framing suitable . reso
lutions and taking action regarding the
death of the Archbishop. j _-- Â¦
The services over the remains will be
gin Thursday night in the cathedral. with
the divine office. At 11:30 o'clock Friday
morning a solemn high requiem mass will
be celebrated. Archbishop Ryan of Phila
delphia, a life-long friend of the deceased
Archbishop, will preach the funeral ser
mon. Bisnop McQuaid of Rochester will
be celebrant.
The following Archbishops have sent
telegrams saying they will be present' at
the funeral: Archbishop Elder, Cincin
nati; Archbishop Feehan, Chicago, who
will be represented by Bishop Muldoon;
Archbishop Williams, Boston; Archbishop
Crystie, Oregon. â¢
ROME, May 6.â The Pope was greatly
distressed when informed of the death of
Archbishop Corrigan of New York. His
Holiness had been a constant inquirer for
news throughout the Archbishop's illness,
sending daily to the American College for
information regarding the prelate's con
dition. . â¢ '
The news of the death of Archbishop
Corrigan was conveyed to the Vatican in
a newspaper dispatch. Mgr. Angeli, the
Pope's private secretary, broke the news
gently to his Holiness. The latter was
greatly depressed and said:
"It has been one of the greatest bitter
nesses of my long life to see the strongest
champions of the militant church claimed
by death. Archbishop Corrigan was very
affectionate to us. We esteemed and loved
him greatly."
The Pope then retired to his private
chapel to pray.
PEORIA, 111., May 6.â The national conven

Teaches the People j
SOne pound of Grape-Nuts contains more nourishmentâ that the I
system will absorbâ than ten pounds of meat; &
An experiment was tried by a man Who found that by leaving off meat (f
! altogether at breakfast and lunch and taking in its ( place four heaping f
teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts, he began to gain flesh and strength and 'i
before the full pound package was gone had gained four pounds in weight, c
whereas he had been losing on his meat diet, Â£
t " A gentleman in Baltimore writes: "I was a steady meat eater three times a day for " Jl
V several years. . For a long time I steadily ran down because of an intense pain in my side **
j and also in the pit of my stomach. I was miserable and everything I ate caused distress. jj
g I fell away from 185 pounds to 150. Somebody told me that if I would change my diet and \
I take Grape-Nuts Food at two meals in the day, I would improve. I made an experiment and \
ii in Icsa than two weeks began to improve very rapidly. I discovered that a few teaspoonfuls /j
\ of Grape-Nuts would furnish more nourishment than quantities of meat. My improvement I
1 has continued until now I weigh 195 pounds, which is a gain of about 45 pounds in five months |
g and I feel in magnificent condition. |
H Grape-Nuts is a crisp, dainty and delicious food, selected from the |
Â« proper parts of the grain and treated by heat, moisture and time to |
gj slowly and perfectly develop the diastase from the grain and transform !Â»
!the starch into grape sugar in the most perfect manner. The small par- J
tides of phosphate of potash found in the certain parts of the cereals are /S
retained, and these elements vitalize and nourish the body, brain and |
nerve centers. . a

or preparation of any kind, and is ready for immediate use and suited to K

27EED NOT DESIGNATE
SCHOOLHOUSE SITES
City Attorney Advises That Charter
Provisions for Bond Issue
Are Vague.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion
yesterday that it is not necessary to
specify the exact location of sites to be
purchased for school buildings under the
proposed bond issue. Lane holds that the
charter does not contemplate the holding
of a bond election until the necessity for
the public improvement has become man
ifest and if it is not now possible definite
ly to ascertain what property will be
available when bonds may be issued for
the improvement, it is not necessary to
describe definitely the piece of property
which the board desires to obtain.
Lane says further that the charter is
altogether too vague to permit of any
absolute determination of the question.
He advises that the selections of sites be
made definite wherever it is possible to do
so, leaving a narrow margin for conjec
ture or dispute as may be necessitated
by the conditions.

Dolores Gonzales de Alsina has filed a

the ground of desertion. She charges that
'.'Not in the house at 2418 Washington
street. She can board," was the reply.
He then made the remark which caused
his wife to give way to her feelings and
which caused Judge Hunt to put the mat
ter over until next Friday.
Marie M. Leonard is suing John P.
Leonard for divorce for failure to pro
vide, alleging that for the last year he
has not contributed toward her support.
They were married in 1899. r
Attorney Hanlon, counsel for Mrs. Ros
enfeld, asked Max at this juncture if he
expected his wife to clothe and feed her
self and the two children, pay house rent
and servant hire on $65 a month.
"How much are you willing to give your
wife now for her support?" .
"Well, Judge, it will cost me about $35
a month to live. I am willing to give 'her
the rest of the hundred."
"Never mind that," said Judge Hunt.
"Tell me how much it has cost you a
month for living expenses for the last six
months." . - .
"About $180 or $200 a month," was the
reply.
"Do you ever get presents of money?"
"Yes. sir; quite often. But if this thing
comes to my father's ears 1 won't get any
more. The honor of the Rosenfelds^ "
"You say you only g^et $100 a month sal
ary?" asked Judge Hunt.
"Yes, sir; that's all."
AS TO HIS SAI/ARY.
JYoung Rosenfeld then took the stand
on his own behalf. He said that his
wife was extravagant and that he had
frequently to pay $40 or $50 a month over
and above the amount he allowed her.
He said that a year ago last Christmas
his brother's wife called his attention to
a bill run by his wife at the White House.
"It was an awfully big bill," said the
witness; "as much as $80 or $90. ., As the
honor of the Rosenfelds had never been
questioned, I cautioned my wife, and so
did my brother. She told him she had a
right to spend her husband's money' if
she felt like it/'
. "I had $60 and some stamps in my
purse," said Mrs. Rosenfeld yesterday,
"when my husband left our home at 2418
Washington street. He took the money
and the stamps when he left. He allowed
me $57 80 a month to run the house on.
he paying the rent and servant hire. I
did the best I could to make both ends
meet, but failed, sometimes. I never
bought my clothes. His sister did that
for me."
She said Rosenfeld had visited the deal
ers from whom she had been purchasing
her supplies and informed them that she
was not to be given credit, thus placing
her in an embarrassing position.
Mrs. Rosenfeld appeared in court last
Friday and stated thafshe was compelled
to borrow clothes to wear to the court, as
her husband had t given her nothing but
reception clothes, which Â¦ she said were
not the proper garments for a woman
in her position to wear. She also said
that while the books of John Rosenfeld
showed that her husband received only
$100 a month, he received presents"
amounting to $150 a month more. When
the case came up yesterday Mrs. Rosen
feld repeated ( her tale. She said that
Louis Rosenfeld, vice president of . the
Rosenfeld corporation, had told her that
this salary arrangement was made to
prevent the other employes of the firm
asking for more- pay and in anticipation
of difficulties â¢ between young Rosenfeld
and herself.
CUT OFF SUPPLIES.
Mrs. Rosenfeld stood rigid for several
minutes, while young Rosenfeld sat ner
vously clasping and unclasping his hands.
The young wife tried to control herself,
but the insult was too much for her to
bear, and she sobbed hysterically. Her
mother and lady friends soothed her and
she finally became quiet, but never for a
moment did she take her eyes from her
husband.
The scene abruptly ended the hearing of
the investigation into the financial affairs
of the Rosenfelds, Judge Hunt continuing
the case until next Friday. Mrs. Rosen
feld will subsist until then on $50,. which
her husband handed over -to- the court
clerk by order of Judge Hunt.
Max Rosenfeld is suing for divorce on
the ground of cruelty.: He is the son of
John Rosenfeld, the wealthy coal mer
chant, and his wife is a niece of Colonel
W. R. Smedberg, the well-known retired
army officer. v Â¦ â¢
A few days after the filing of the suit
for 1 divorce Mrs. Rosenfeld asked the
court for an allowance of $150 a month,
pending the trial of the suit and for $75
to relieve her immediate necessities,
claiming- that she was witnout, provisions
or clothing for, herself, and two children.
"I asked her mother if she -wouldn't
take her . daughter as a boarder just as
she did other people, and she said she
would not. because she was afraid her
good name would be injured."
Max LÂ». Rosenfeld deliberately blacken
ed the character of his wife yesterday in
Judge Hunt's court by making the above
answer to a question put to him by Mrs.
Rosenfeld's counsel. He smiled as he did
so, but hung his head when the accused
woman rose from her seat and cried out
in heart-broken tones:
"Oh, Max! Max! How dare you?- How
could you, Max?" ; ...

(^A PUDDING HAS '
U TWO SIDES/' ||f
It has an inside and an outside!
The inside of a pudding, like the inside of
a shoe, is the most serious part of it
If "the proof of the pudding is in the eating"
the proof of a shoe is in the wearing of it
' ' It is the wear of $3*50 Regals, which proves
the materials put into them equal to their $6,00
appearance*
"Tannery to Consumer" system helps the
inside of Regals, even more than the outside.
Style book explains why. ,, j
