EXCLUSION ARGUMENTS
Chinese Minister Almost Falls Out of Gal*
lery in His Eagerness:
tlon ' against fraud. An effort has been
made to liberalize those provisions relat
ing to the exempted classes. No radical
departure was proposed from the statutes
now in operation, the bill being. a virtual
codification of the existing laws and regu
lations concerning the ! admission to this
country of Chinese persons. The aim of
the f ramers was carefully to avoid any
thing which might give Just cause, for of
fense to the Chinese, empire, and to an
extent, at least, it was a more liberal
measure, so far as the- exempted' classes
were concerned, than that which is now
on the statute books. . '
Mitchell then' entered on an extended
analysis of the proposed measure, making
his explanation of its provisions in 'the
light of the decisions of the highest courts
relating^ to Chinese exclusion which have
been delivered since the enactment of the
Geary act. The theory on which j the'
measure was constructed, he said, "is not
that all Chinese persons who are not pro
hibited may. enter this country; but. upon
the contrary, the legislation proceeds upon
the theory that only those, are allowed to
enter who are especially allowed." There
fore, every Chinese person shall be deemed
a laborer, within the meaning of the. bill,
who is not an official, a teacher, a student,
a merchant or a traveler for pleasure.
PREVENTION OF FRATTD.
Referring to the regulations in the meas
ure .for the prevention of fraud, Mitchell
said that no one could question'success
fully the authority of Congress to estab
lish and enforce all necessary rules which
would operate as statutory safeguards
against fraud and which would test prop
erly the good faith of Chinese persons
claiming to belong to one or another j of
the exempted classes. He held that this
Government never would barter away Its
inalienable right to inhibit the coming to
this country of any class of people from
any country en earth if in the Judgment of
Congress such persons were objectionable;
Mitchell expressed belief that the con-.
Btltutionality of 'the proposed measure
could not be challenged successfully, "it
is in line," said he, "with the overwhelm
ing sentiment of this country. It is not,
when Viewed from the proper standpoint,
in conflict, with any existing treaty stipu
lations between the United States and
China. Even If it. were this could; be
urged only as a policy objection and not
one that for a moment would go to "any
lack of power in Congress under the con-
"The right to exclude foreigners is one
of the' highest attributes v^ilch attaches
to "American sovereignty. Indeed, , so all
controlling^ Is this right that no treaty
stipulation to the contrary can stand for
one moment .j against it. ' But happily the
legislation proposed does not involve any
question-of public faith. The. bill; is but
an attempt to Â¦ crystallize into one intelli
gent,> harmonious^ statute 'â¢ the laws tupon
this subject as they exist to-day with such'
elaboration and /extension v as are. neces
sary to,apply the' policy.', of .exclusion to
our Insular, possessions. . It is legislation
Further . along Mitchell said the pro
posed legislation . "is but another grand
step forward by the republic in the majes
tic and progressive march of true Ameri
canism,. which looks to protection of
American labor and to the preservation,
purity and, perpetuity of American insti
tutions. It is a grand step in the direc
tion of freeing our people and our Institu
tions from jj the, corrupting and corroding
influences of pauper labor and those viru
lent and j destructive vices so inseparably
connected with the lower classes of Asi
atic, serfdom and whose poisonous virus,
if permitted to permeate our-body politic,
inevitably will lead to lamentable blight,
pitiable .. decay and ultimate destruction.
Nfa higher rests upon the National
Congress, than to guard . with scrupulous
care and untiring vigilance the doors
which stand . between us and foreign na
tions, to the end that no classes of people
of any nation whatever be permitted to
enter whose presence, in the Judgment of
the American" Congress, would be a men
ace to. _the virile growth and preservation
of these Institutions which go to make
our republic what it is to-dayâ the most
healthy and ; vigorous, morally, intellectu
ally ; and ; otherwise, -of any , nation that
has ever lived since | the beginning of
time. ... . , ;
PROTECTION OF LABOR.
He pointed out that China had assented
to the policy of exclusion and had not re
garded such a policy on the part of. the
United States as hostile to the empire of
China. , .
stituticn to enact a law. It is legislation
not only in line with public sentiment of
this country, but also with the estab
lished policy of this Government."

tain may be requested to break up .'the
camp at Chalmette, Louisiana, which it is
charged is used by her agents as a base
for military operations against the Boers.
As a result of the consideration given
the matter to-day the President directed
Attorney General Knox to order an In
vestigation of the camp, to determine
whether/ its -maintenance is in violation
of the position of the. United States : as
neutral. Secretary Hay, it is expected,
will make an inquiry of Lord Pauncefote,
tho British Embassador, in relation- to
the matter. It is possible that Secretary
Root may -order an array officer to in
spect the camp. The action of the Presi

his Cabinet of the charges made by Gov
ernor Heard of Louisiana, which were re

General Kitchener (Lord Kitchener's brother)
sent Colonels Kelr and Cooks 'on from" Vrele

through the bush. Emerging on a plain, large
Boer reinforcements advanced against their
flanks, forcing the British troops to take up a
defensive position, which they hastily entrench

The basic principles of the pending bill

Mitchell. In beginning, said that-, the
policy of Chinese exclusion had become
one of the great policies of this countcy,
acquiesced In by all political parties afcd
as firmly fixed as the Monroe doctrine. It
is a policy based upon the general wel
fare, upon the principle of protection to
American labor and upon the doctrine of
protection against noxious infection of
those Institutions which constitute Am
erican civilization.
WASHINGTON. April 4.â The Senate to
day began consideration of the Chinese
exclusion bill, Mitchell . of. Oregon .making
the opening speech. He pointed out force
fully the necessity for exclusion of Chi
nese laborers and carefully and elaborate

constructed on the basis of existing law,
in the light of experience and of the de

Chinese exclusion legislation. The sub

of the Chinese Legation. Senator Mitch

speech in favor of Chinese exclusion. The

the House, where Representative Champ
Clark of Missouri was delivering one of
bis characteristic hammer and ' tongs
tpeeches denouncing Chinese immigration
and predicting disastrous consequences

Chinese Minister had no trouble in hear

The United States Government officials
In San Francisco who worked on the case
were not informed by the British Consul
General as to the identity of the man
who betrayed his accomplices. The Brit

of the men who furnished Scanlan and
Van Derline with funds. The British
representatives simply asked the Amer

were in this city and traveling to Vic

LONDON, April 4.â A correspondent ot
the London Standard, during the cours*?
of a long review yesterday of- the Situa
tion in Spain, said the Carlists and Re
publicans had so far_ shown no disposi
tion to disturb the accession of the young
King Alfonso to the throne, though some
rumors had lately come from Barcelona
concerning the restlessness of the Carlists
in their old haunts In the Catalonian
Mountains. But, the correspondent point
ed out, Carlism after all, in the opinion
of the majority of Spaniards, cannot
amount to much so long as no revolutions
occur at Madrid and in the great towns
The correspondent further says the
Carlists have been seriously weakened by ,
the secession of the ultramontanes, one
of their most important groups. . . .: j â¢;

A strong effort Is being made to identify
the members of the Landsthing, who are
suspected of furnishing information to
Congressman Richardson. So far it has
not been successful.
There was an exciting debate on the
Danish West Indies Islands treaty in the
executive session of the Landsthing to
day. The opposition members violently
attacked the treaty and plied the Foreign
Minister, Dr. Deuntzsr, with numerous
questions, to which he replied firmly and
clearly. There is great public interest in
the question and the agitation and ex
citement are intense. Both sides are con
fident of success.
Dr. Deuntzer, who occupies premiership,
knows that the iving throughout hla long
reign has never opposed the Ministry and
will not listen to the slightest whisper of
intrigue. ' Neither does he fear the anti
ministerial Senate. He considers that the
upper house will scarcely dare to wipe
out the enormous majority of '. the, lower
house, but will try to save its dignity
by proposing a pleoiscitiimof inhabitants
of the islands. This Dr. Deuntzer and his
colleagues in the Government might be
willing to accept.
â¢ But the only person who really counts
and has direct influence is the -King.
This model monarch has ever subordi
nated his private desires and sentiments
to the policy of the interests of his-coun
try. In the present case he has -acted as
he has always done artd remained true
to his reputation. His feelings are re
pugnant to the sale, which hurts his
pride. But patriotism, calls of a politeo
economic convenience and the " over
whelming vote of the Folkething have
caused the King to side with the people.
In spite of his personal sentiments and
those of his entire family, he is. for the
sale and has given his approval. : ' :
It is quite true that intriguers are many
and now at the last moment petitions are
being sent to the King against the sale.
Family and other influences are being ex
erted in the same direction.

C cide. â¢ The i influx of . so much American - and
colonial blood may. have very, important conse
quences; at which some' of the old Oxonians
| would stand aghast.- Having decided that each
rtate or colonial unit should have. one scholar-
I ship allowed to it every year, Mr. Rhodes' will
â¢proceeds to define thÂ« terms upon 'which these
; scholarships should be allotted. .Mr. Rhodes
; always opposed the modern I idea of awardln*
Ian educational , prize solely. for literary attain
i menu. The tendency to award a scholarship
, solely for success In passing literary examlna
; tloas seemed to him to put a premium on book
;. worms. Hence he has drawn up a scheme for
the election "of- students for" his scholarships
; which is extremely original and very charae
â¢. teristlc of the ; man. It is as follows:
j Mr. Rhodes' will appoints . a well known
group cf seven of . his friends as general ex
; editors of bis estate. This group Is further
charged to undertake the duty of acting as
\ trustees for the educational endowment fund,
1 which will provoke the liveliest discussion and
i excite the keenest interest throughout both
I the United States' and the British empire, for
I both communities share In the benefit of Mr.
I Rhodes' bequest. Mr. Rhodes, was a graduate
| of Oxford and a student at Oriel College, to
t which, by the way, he has left a special be
i quest of $500,000. He has made Oxford Cnl
: versity. in whose glories the American de
j 6cendantÂ» of its founders share equally with
! thost- who still inhabit the old country;.' the
: center of his educational sctieme and he has
left a sum 'which may â¢ be roughly capitulated
as representing S10.000.000 for the foundation
of Anglo-American scholarships. Mr. Rhodes.
; it will be remembered, was so impressed with
; the value of a university education that, after
1 he had been compelled to break his course at
j Oxford by ill health, which rendered it im
Â¦ pot-pfWe for him to winter in England, he re
i turned every summer from South Africa, in
'Â¦ order to complete his university career. To his
I thinking the university, better than any other
I .Institution, naturally affords a vivifying cen- :
I ter of race unity. It is free from all political
| complications, and a residential university,
1 with the old traditions of Oxford, seemed to
him the best fitted for the purpose he had in
I view. When I discussed with him the question
I of the university which should "be selected as
I thiÂ«; race center, the respective claims of Ox
: ford and Cambridge, or some American uni-,
j versity, were freely discussed. That Mr.'
I Rhodes settled the question in favor of Oxford
Â¦ wav due to his devotion to his old university,'
â¢ and if these fellowships' had to be. tenable at
1 any one center it would be difficult to cavil
at his choice. Mr. Rhodes, therefore, having
selected Oxford as hi* race center, from his
love of his old alma mater, has drawn up a
broad outline of the general conditions on
which these scholarships should be awarded.
TIm central principle of his scheme is that
every English-speaking colony and every Btatp
and Territory In the American Union should
be offered a scholarship of the value of $1500
a year, tenable for three years, at Oxford. I5y
Â¦ thle means Mr.- Rhodes believed it^would be
possible to make Oxford the. center of the
spirit of race unity, where students from every
'Â¦ part of the 'English-speaking world would meet '
'â¢en common Rrpund, in .the- most- famous of the
I'old universities. ' â¢â¢:*,, â¢?..Â¦*"
Friends as Executors.
Mr. Rhodes' first will was made in Septem
ber, 1S77, when he waa a young man of. 24.
At that time he was only beginning to amass
the wealth which, before he died, had made
him a multimillionaire, not in dollars, but in
pounds sterling. His last will was dated July
1, i&'Jtt. But the two documents are essentially
alikt in sentiment. They both embody. In ex
press terms, what was ever the master thought
of this rnaster mir.d â the necessity for promot
ing the reunion of the English-speaking race.
The will of Cecil Rhodes is in every respect
worthy of its author. With the exception of
seme family estates in this country, the whole
of which is left to his own relatives. Mr.
Rhodes has dedicated his wealth in diamond
and sold mines to public uses. Its disposition
is dictated by what was ever the dominating
principle of his life.
What renders this will of exceptional Inter
est to Americans is the Yact that it reveals for
the first time, under his hand and seal, that
he v.as nr> mere British Imperialist, but that
he was essentially a citizen of the English
speaking world. In other -words, his will
proves how accurately I interpreted his senti
ments when I declared, on the strength of
roanj' intimate and confldential conversations,
that, he - rocngnlzed as his common fatherland
the great English-speaking community, which
includes both tbe United States and the British
empire witliin its ample frontier. : â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢. ;
W. T. Stead wrote the following for the
Associated Press:
Explained by Stead.
All the Rhodes scholarships, American,
colonial and German, aie at Oxford.
Rhodes' will is a remarkable ahu volumin
ous document of more than 2500 words.
Even this is not the entire will, as tne
executors only gave out the portions
which they consider to b6 of" puonc in
terest. There is a codicil attached on the
day of the deceased's last departure from
England, and another cabled from Cape
Town leaves Â£4000 yeany to keep up tne
spot in the Matoppo Hiils where his re
mains are to be buried.. The will further
directs that a railroad extension be made
into the Matoppo Hills, so -that 'visitors
may go there at the week-end to inspect
the "majesty and glory of their surround
ings." â¢
Khodes explicitly says he is to be buried
.in an aperture cut in the solid rock, sur
mounted by a brass tablet bearing the
words: â¢
"Here lie' the remains of Cecil John
Rhodes."
No one else is to be buried there who
has not deserved well of his country.
Rhodes bequeaths all his landed prop
erty near Buluwayo and Salisbury, both
in Matabeleland, to trustees, whom he di
rects to cultivate the land for the instruc
tion of the people of Rhodesia. His cele
brated country place near Cape Town
Rhodes leaves as a residence for the
"Prime Minister of the Federal Govern
ment of South Africa," with Â£1000 yearly
for its maintenance. i

SALT LAKE, Utah, Ai>rll 4.â Clyde Fell,
a bey barely 15 years eld, to-day confesseu
to the police that it was he who cut the
throat of Samuel Collins, the aged watcii
ir.an of the Wasatka Mineral Springs,
whose body was found last Sunday in a' :
small cave in the hillside above Warm
Springs. .The. .deed was done,, the . boy
cla'ms, only after repeated urging by the
old man, who told the boy that he Intend
ed to kill himself anyway, as he was tired
of living. After cutting Collins' throat.
Felt says, he took the old man's clothes
and hid them under a pile of bowlders,
walled up the entrance to the cave. as best
he couia wiped the blood off the razor
with his fingers, then went down the hill
and washed his hands in the stream.
Collins, he said, had given him a little
money for killing him.
Young Felt toid the police yesterday
that Collins had committed suicide after
arranging, with him to wall up the/en
trance to the cave so his body could not
be found. Karly this morning, in com
pany with iwo policemen, the boy went
out anxong the hills to locate Collins'
valist. which he claimed he had carried
up for the. old man the day of his death.
After several hours' search. Felt broke
down and confessed. Felt said: . ...
I killed the old man but I couldn't help it.
He made me do it. We didn't go up Easisn
Â¦ Ftfck at all, and I didn't have any valise to
tarry. The old man told me to tell that story
if his body was found: When we got up to
the little cave he began undressing. I ask. d
htm what he was dorns that for, and he said
he was polng to commit suicide." I said "Oh I
-â¬3on"t do that while I am up here." Then he
caid: "I want you to kill me. Here are some
txak'-s and some rope. You tie me down and
tb.-n cut my throat " I didn't like to do it; i
but he bersed so hard that I jnst couldn't 'â¢
etand it. He -took the rope and wrapped it!
nround his legs and grot me to tie his arms to j
his tide. Then I took the razor. He kept on '
iH-gring. and finally I just' took the razor and ;
fe-a\e one <?lash across his throat and jumped j
<vut of the hole and ran. He had told me to '
bury hit= clothes, so I went and got th= pile j
and carried them away down the gully and 4
Iniritd them. Then I went back and the old j
man was dead. I took eome rocks and built *
v-Â£i; in front of the cave for about a foot. Bu;
1 pot scared and didn't finish it. so 1 came back

Nevertheless the police believe that the
boy has not told all of his story and are
working on the theory that others were
implicated. Behind the crime is a story
of moral degeneracy that has few paral
lels. Collins, according to the police, had
a number of the boys in the neighborhood j

press the belief that his death was the
culmination of a plot on the part of the

THE GREAT YAXQUISHER OF ALL

The Marvelous Cure of '-- Mps.
Cook of Gardner, Kansas.
Rheumatism, terrible in its acute, and
longr enduring: in its chronic, form, is one
of the most baneful diseases that human
beings suffer from. It is a disease that
will not bear neglect, for if not treated
j promptly will remain till death to harass,
torture and make life, miserable.
Rheumatism is also a constitutional dis-
order and hereditary. Because of an in-
active condition of the kidneys and bowels
the blood is not purified and an acrid poi-
son is formed and deposited in the
muscles and joints, and thlc , "*""Â« the
inflammation and intense agon!e3- that
thousands are obliged to endure. Too
often. the effects of rheumatism are fatal,
especially when the dread disease affects
the heart; then death is stidden. Many
other serious complications result from
this terrible disease, such as pneumonia,
pleurisy, meningitis and diaphragmitla,
and these often prove rapidly fatal.
Racked and tortured, reader, what are
you doing to get rid of your danger? Phy-
! sicians camlidly admit their inability to
cure. The ordinary medicines of the day
may give you relief for a few hours or
days; they cannot banish \he disease from
your blood, joints and muscles; they can-
not take the swellings from your knees,
elbows or wrists, or, make supple the stif-
fened and twisted limbs. You cannot
longer afford to experiment; death is the
sure result of experiment and neglect.
To-day your only hope Ile3 in the imme-
diate use of" Dr. Phelps' wonderful rheu-
matism banlsherâ Paine's Celery Com-
pound. This tested and world-famed van-
quisher of rheumatism, ' neuralgia and
other troubles that arise from impure and
poisoned blood is now fully recognized by
the medical profession as a positive, and
! unfailing cure. The following Important
letter sent by Mrs. Cook is but one of the
many thousands received from prominent
and well-known people in every State of
the Union Â¦ who have been cured . by
Paine's Celery Compound. Mr?. Cook
says :
"I was sorely afflicted with rheumatism
some time ago, so much so that T was un-
able to go about the house; I had to be
carried. I tried all kinds of medicines and
; liniments to no effect. For months I was
j helpless, unable to turn myself in bed.
j ana suffering with pain which was almost
unendurable. Finally, by chance. I noticed
â¢ an advertisement of Paine's Celery Com-
| pound and concluded to try it. After using
! one bottle it seemed to be helping me. and
J I continued to use it until I had no more
I rheumatic pains. Since then I have been
I able to do my housework and have* been
free from rheumatism."- .

Without concluding the reading of the
bill the Senate, at 3:25 p. m., went into
executive session ,' and at' 5 p: m. ' ad
journed. . '-. .
-In responseto an inquiry, by Quay, ; Pen
rose, in charge of the measured said he
could not accept the amendment, as not a
member of ' the Immigration Committee
was in favcr of it.
-'"How many Chinese will the amend
ment let in?" inquired Mitchell.
"I hope it will have the effect," replied
Quay, "of Christianizing the entire Chi
nese Empire."
"It would let in at least a million," sug
gested Mitchell.
"Quite likely y 350,000,000." interjected
Hale. â¢
Platt of Connecticut introduced the fol
lowing as a substitute for the bill:
"That nothing herein contained shall be
construed to exclude. Chinese Christians,
or Chinese who assisted in the defense or
relief of the foreign legations of the
Pe-tang Cathedral, in the City of Peking,
in the year 1900."
Quay gave notice of the following
amendment as an additional section:
QUAY'S AMENDMENT.
which seeks to throw the folds of protec
tion around the laborer of this country
and also : to protect from pollution the
morality of the republic and of the people
which otherwise must inevitably result
from an admixture with our people of un
limited numbers of a race wholly incapa
ble to assimilation, who never can be
come citizens and. whose vices are a dead
ly and dangerous' menace to i our people
and our Government."
. In conclusion Mitchell" warned the Re
publicans of the Senate that if they failed
to pass the proposed bill, which had been
agreed upon by a. non-partisan commis
sion, and insisted on forcing the passage
of a statute "which is inadequate and. In
efficient, then at the coming election look
out for such .a vote of condemnation of
the Republican party on the Pacific Coast
as you have not heard since the over
throw o.f the Republican party in 1SS4."Â«
The reading of the exclusion bill -was
begun and various committee amend
ments and amendments on phraseology
were agreed to. -
We of. the Pacific Coast . are perhaps more
deeply concerned ' In this J question Hhan any
other people. We feel their presence amoni

Clark of Missouri, . a member: of the
committee, who made a minority report
in favor of the Senate bill, which Is more
drastic. than the House measure, followed
Perkins. , He predicted that if the Su

zens and subjects of Spain in the Philip
pine Islands became American citizens by
annexation/thus allowing the free. entry
of Chinamen into the United States from
the Philippines, the islands would "be un

Clark maintained that the people of the
Pacific Coast understood the Chinese prob
lem better than the people of the. other
sections, just as, . he said,, the people of
the South were more competent to . deal
with 'the negro' question than those, of
the North. ' : For | that .reason he favored
the bill which the representatives of , the
Pacific. Coast had' prepared.' If -the sub
stitute bill failed, Clark said he .would
offer the provision, to prohibit Chinese
crews on American ships as an amend
ment to the majority bill. : He character
ized the threat of the Pacific Mail Com
pany to sail under English register if the
provision ; went into, the bill, as a "bluff,
pure " and simple." .Â¦ > â¢Â¦. Â¦ --. > â¢ Â«â¢>,.

as follows: " ,
Perkins of New York, who drew the re
port upon the bill, explained the measure
In detail. . .,-
Hitt, chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, who had charge of the
bill, said the committee was unanimous
in the opinion that the admission of Chi
nese laborers into this country would be
a serious evil. One of the main problems
which the committee had to solve, .he
said, was in connection with the admis
sion of the privileged classes, merchants,
travelers, omcials, teachers and students,
bo as to prevent fraud; and at the same
time to avoid harassing and tormenting
bona fide Chinese merchants. , . '

AFTER a tedious trip of four hun

Sierra Nevada Mountains, Â¦ Mrs.
Nellie * Vanderwerker has re
covered possession of her 11-year
old son, Thomas, who mysteriously dis
appeared from his home, 260 Fifth street,
Oakland, two weeks ago.- The bQy was
abducted by E. J. Vanderwerker, his
father, the parents having been separated
for five years. "
It was by means of a letter the lad had
surreptitiously sent to his mother after
he had been taken to Bella Vista, a little
hamlet near Redding, in the lumber couiv
try, that she got the first clew to her.
missing- boy's whereabouts. , Â¦. Nothing
Â¦daunted by the problem ahead, Mrs. Van
derwerker, accompanied by her father,
Thomas Lane, started immediately upon
the trail. It was a long, hard, perilous
trip, and its successful culmination is due
alone to the hardihood of the mother, who
had determined to pursue - her fugitive
husband until she recovered her boy. / 
' The mother and her father arrived at
Bella Vista and enlisted the services of
the Sheriff and the local peace officers.
The boy was espied by the officers in the
town, but upon their approach he fled
and started off Into the mountains, fear
ing, as he afterward explained, that the
ofncers'were sent by his father to over
haul him. It was a boyish vagary based
on the exciting adventures he had passed
through since his parent took him away
from Oakland.
Then the country was aroused. The
story of the mother's pursuit enlisted thu
sympathy of the country folk. Farmers
and cattlemen joined the SMeriff's depu
ties and Mrs. Vanderwerker in, the hunt
for the child, who was only found after
the whole country side had been scoured.
The frightened fugitive youngster was
half, starved and well nigh exhausted
when the searching parties came upon
him. There was a joyful reunion of the
lad and his half-crazed . mother who had
had a hand in the disappearance, but
could not get a clew to the parent's loca
tion after he left Sacramento.
"The boy is safe at home again." said
Mrs. Vanderwerker yesterday, "and that
is all there is to it.' r j
"Yes, I wt-nt after him," she added
modestly, "and we shall try to keep him
with us now." .

PARIS, April 4.â An interesting histor
ical revelation has been made by Count
de Keratry. a former^Prefect of Police, at
a banquet given by the Aero Club in
honor of the thirteen.surviving aeronauts
who left Paris during the siege of that
city in 1870-71. The Count, who descended
at Prillon, near Bar le Due, Department
of Meuse, after a perilous journey, said
he was intrusted by the national defense
with admission to go to Madrid and per
suade Marshal Prim to proclaim a repub
lic in Spain. Keratry had in the balloon
60,000,000 francs in treasury bonds, which
a detachment of ! Prussian Uhlans nearly
captured. The money' was intended to
equip and pay an army corps of 50,000
men, which Spain was to place at
France's disposition. Marshal' Prim re
fused to undertake the task, although
Senor Castelar and other Spanish Repub
licans supported the proposition. Marshal
Prim was assassinated three months aft
erward and his murderer was never dis
covered.

OF THE SIEGE OF PARIS
J. Ross Clark believes that the Salt
Lake road will be constructed within a.
couple of years. He said to-day:
"I cannot see that anything will stop
us. The time will depend only on how
successful we are in getting materials.
The tangle of surveys has about been
straightened and we will soon let the con
tracts and start work from the Salt Lak*
end." -
Local railroad authorities believe that
the combination of interests between
Gould and Clark fs all that has saved tha
Salt Lake road; but tor Gould coming in.
it is contended, the Clark road would
never have become more than a system
of short lines about Los Angeles.
The announcement is made that Gould
will visit Los Angeles within the next
month.
"I haven't received any direct informa
tion," vouchsafed the Senator's brother.
LOS ANGELES, April 4.â Los Angeles

The contest of the two sons, Edward M.
and Andrew J. Piercy, for guardianship of
their mother has been very bitter. Some
time ago Mrs. Piercy deeded to Edward
Piercy $30,000 worth of property, and this
started the strife. In his petition, for
guardianship Andrew alleged that Ed
ward was keeping his mother practically
a prisoner and refused to allow any one
to see her. E. M. Piercy retaliated by
declaring that Andrew J. had mistreated
his mother.
SAN' JOSE, April 4.â Mrs> Mary Piercy,
an aged pioneer woman of this county,
over whose possessions her sons have
been fighting . In the courts, is to have
guardians for both her person and her

hearing a few weeks ago of the petition
of Andrew Piercy to be appointed
guardian of his mother Judge Hyland to
day appointed Mrs. Mary Martel. a

The rirst mining accident in the Thun
der Mountain gold fields was reported in
a letter received to-day. The victim was
J. Gilman, who narrowly escaped death.
He had put in live shots and started to
fire them at midnight. He spit the fuse
with a^ candle. The fifth did not spit
readily and Gilman dallied with it too
long. The first shot went off, throwing a
mass of rock down on him. He was
crawling away when the second shot
went on", sending down another mass of
rock. The bulk of it went one side and
Gilman managed to creep to safety,
bleeding and half dead, before the other
shots went off. He will recover unless it
develops he is injured internally.
J. C. Crowley, who arrived from Thun
der Mountain to-day, via Council and
Weiser, reports the trail in fine condition.
He says reports of strikes keep the camp
in a turmoil all the time and miners rush
from one section to another as fast as
they can locate claims, braving untold
dangers and privations.
"No man has gone into Thunder Moun
tain who has not made money, and- many
have already become wealthy," said
Crowley. .,
There are now three townsites in Tl'un

and the other two Thunder Mountain.

BOISE, IDAHO, April 4.â A large party
left here to-day for Thunder Mouptnin,
via the Weiser route, the only one from
the south that it is possible to go through
at this time, as the trail breakers sent
out from Boise to go in over the Bear
Valley route hJtve made it as far as Penn
Basin, sixty miles from Thunder Moun
tain. They are building cabins as they
proceed from the south. It is expected
that the route will be opened through in
side of a weeK or ten days, when practi
cally all of the travel coming here will go
in that way. The subscription for a
wagon roaa from. Bear Valley has been
completed and the work on it will be
commenced soon. Thirty thousand dol

twenty thousand in Fittsburg and the
balance in Boise. The necessity for get

with gold and runs over $16,000 a ton.
Tnis ore is from a chute that has been
opened up near tne Dewey mine. The

high class ball all seem to insure the best
season in the history of the national

the home team. In the afternoon in this
city Jimmie Whalen will 1 make his. first
appearance, being opposed by Dowling of
Sacramento. â¢ Â¦ Â¦. .
In this afternoon's game Nordyke will
be the only familiar face seen in Uncie
Henry's team. The others come with good
recorei3 from Eastern teams and are ex
pected to prove pennant winners in any
company they will be called upon to meet
during the eight months', season that
stretches out before them.
For several weeks Captain Shugart has
had his men out practicing at Recreation
Park, and he is favorably impressed with
the form they are showing. Several of
the Eastern men complain about the cli
mate, and it can hardly be expected they
will show their true form for a month or
six weeks at least. â¢ â¢ . .- Â¦ ,
A great many of the "fans" last season
were wont to remark triat the league was
"shy" on left-handed pitching talent. Not
so the coming year. â¢ The several man
agers, as if to atone for last year's griev
ance,' have signed seven box artists who
hurl with their "south wings." San Fran
cisco-has Meredith and Kane, Sacramen
to Dowling and Hickey, Oakland Jans^n
and Crystall and Los Angeles the mighty
Rube Â¦Waddell. -A singular fact is they
are' all' big men, and no doubt the league
will "witness , the greatest slab work since
the days when' Charley Sweeney was at
the height of his career. -
The umpire department, which was woe
fully weak last year,- has been strength
ened. Two of the best known judges of
the game will wield the indicators in the
coming race for the flag. Jack Q'Connell
and Jim McDonald need no Introduction
to the admirers of the game. Both are
old players and men of great presence or
mind, and it goes without saying this de
partment of the game will receive the at
tention it demands.
All pf the reserved section of the stand
at Recreation Park has been fitted up
with chairs, and this will be good news
to those who enjoy solid comfort. The
diamond has been planted with grass, and
in a few weeks the grounds at Eighth ana
Harrison streets -will "look good", to the
eye of the most critical. A delegation of
"fans" several hundred strong will ac
company Mike Fisher's colts to this city
to witness the opening games. A section
of the stand has been reserved for them,
and, of course, they will do some rooting.
1 The opening day has at last arrive-!.
The "fans" are .eager, the players are
willing and the managers are anxious,
and when the old,, familiar cry of "play
ball" floats through the air the ball
grounds "down on the flat" will present a
gala day appearance, and the national
game will be ushered in with more â¢ pomp
and splendor than it has known since the
halcyon days of the old Haight street
grounds. The game this afternoon will,
be called at 3:15 o'clock, and to-morrow
at 2:30 p. m. . '
The coming race for the Perpetual chal
lenge cup is a frequent topic of discussion
among yachtsmen. At the special meet
ing of the directors of the Corinthian
Yacht Club held last week to consider the
challenge sent in by the San-Franciscos
ft was decided to acknowledge Its receipt,
and a committee was appointed to confer
with the committee of tne San Franciscos.
The" Corinthians pointed out that the deed
of gift evidently intended to give the de
fending club thirty days within which to
hold the race, as it requires that the race
be sailed not less than thirty nor more
than sixty days after the date of the
chawenge. As there is the further limita
tion " that the race must be sailed not
earlier than May 1 nor later than Septem
ber SO, if the challenging club dated its
challenge March 1 only one day, May 1
would be open for the race. As the Sari
Francisco challenge' was dated March 18
the race must have taken place not later
than May 18, nor earlier than May 1 thus
allowing a period of only eighteen 'davs.
The Corinthians did not wish to establish
the precedent of accepting a challenge
which thus limited the period of thirtv
days to which the defending club ia en
titled. The secretary of the San Francisco
Yacht Club has stoce amended-the date Df
the challenge to April 1, thus idvine thÂ£
whole month of May. for the sllectifn of
the race day. - â

THE yachting season of 1802 will be
formally ushered in to-day by the
opening festivities of the California
Yacht Club on Oakland estuary. The
Several members of the Olympic Boat
Club were at Tlburon on Sunday, among
them being C. W. Dobie, Leo Starr, Wil
liam Fulton, F. E. Rous, W. Claussen,
W. Longwell, Guy Ransom, Charles
Brandenstein, Percy Hammond, S. J.
Pembroke, J. Owen. J. R. Bockman and
George James. Some of these went out
in barges and others in outraged sWffs.
To-morrow the clubhouse will be open to
ladies.
Many members of the South End Row
ing Club are to be seen every Sunday
around the clubhouse, all the barges and
outrigged sk'fTs being in demand through
out the day. There are several candidates
for places in the junior barge crews; and
these present themselves at an early hour
at the boathouse. One of the most prom
ising crews is made up of A. Hennessey,
bow; J. O'Brien. No. 2; P. J. Connolly,
No. 3, and Alexander McKerron, stroke.
Charles Jenkins was out with a crew
made up of A. McKerron. bow, C. E. \
Crelghton. No. 2; A. Korn.-No. 3; Charles
Jenkins, stroke and H. Low, cockswain.
Another barge crew consisted of Maurice
Cashman, bow; E. Pallas, No. 2; T. Pal
las.^ No. 3; Edward Wolff, stroke, and
Albert Sonnenberg, cockswain. E. Cash
man and Alexander McKerron are prac
ticing in the outrigged skiff and are snow,
ing considerable speed. Judge A. L.,FritÂ»
is a regular visitor at the boathouse.
The South Ends have been suffering
from a lack of oars, but three sets of
barge cars and two pairs of sculls havÂ»
been ordered in the East and are expect
ed to reach the city shortly. All thÂ»
barges have been overhauled and are in
good condition, including the Felton thÂ«
South End. the Captain Thomas and the
old Flyblister. A special committee, con
sisting of Charles Jenkins, Thomas Bar
ry, John Humphreys and C. E. A. Creigh
ton, has been appointed to coach the
members who have recently joined the
club. The club has more than a hundred
members.
The Arlels are without quarters and are
devoting all their energies to building up
the fund for the construction and equip
ment of their proposed new boathouse.
The Pioneers have a temporary boathouso
but no direct communication with tho
water. The Dolphins and South Ends,
however, are displaying a good deal of
activity. A Dolphin junior barge crew
has already been made up and goes out
for practice on Sundays. Nearly twenty
men have already signed their names on
the list of entries for the barge races, the
prizes in which will be the medals offered
by Albert P. Rothkopf. On Sunday thÂ»
large pleasure-boat of the Dolphins was
rowed around to the Union Iron Works
by T. R. Keenan, Leo Welnarid. J. S.
Earla, "VV. O. Donovan, O. M. Farrell and
Joseph Gallagher. F. J. Sherry, Georgs
Baker and Alex W. Pape were out for
practice in outrigged skiffs.
The entertainment committee of thÂ»
Dolphin Boating Club has arranged to
hold a schooner trip and clambake next
month, a dance in the boathouse on a
moonlight night in July and a ladies" day
in November. In August the club will
celebrate its silver anniversary, it hav
ing been founded in 1S78, its charter mem
bers being John, Herman and Adolpa
Wieland; Emil. Val, J. and B. Kehrlein:
E. Kalpen, Fred Deucher, E. Bornemann,
J. Higgins, G. Baratz, Thomas Fraser and
A. P. Rothkopf. The twenty-fifth anni
versary will be celebrated by a ball, at
which silver oars will be given as souve
nirs. The club already having on Its roll
as many members as its quarters can ac
commodate, the initiation fee has been
raised to $15.
THE only two rowing clubs on this side
of the bay whose members are able to
indulge in barge and skiff pulling at
the present time are the South End*
and the Dolphins.
Another handicap tournament for Juve
niles was commenced on the park courts
during the week and will be completed
next week. These events are popular with
the: youngsters and should develop some
good players.
Bonnie Hugh-le, General Dewet. Fearful Shin
Mose, Olita. White Hat, Real Lassie, Semi
r/ronJus, Vagrant, Santonin, Sir" Pasha, King

fast.
The most regular attendants on the
local courts at present are Judges ""Hunt
Troutt, Kerrigan and Sloss and Dr. Law
ton. The6e experts are out almost every
day and participate in some lively doubles
Hunt and Troutt are improving very rap
idly and will make a strong team with a
little more practice.
The nineteenth tournament for the Da
vis cups will be played to-morrow on the
California Club courts. There is . more
interest in '< to-morrow's event than any
one of the kind so far, as the teams are
on the homestretch and the finish is a
close one. The Smith brothers lead, with
four victories to their credit, while Collier
and Crowell are a close second, with three
victories. The brothers won the last
three tournaments .straight, -but it is
cloiibtf ul if they can make it four, as they
â¢will probably be handicapped out of it
to-morrow. There is some talk of mak
ing the Smith brothers play scratch with
Collier and Crowell. In case these two
teams come together it would probably
be right for them to play on even terms,
but the Smiths should not be asked to
give the same handicap to other teams as
do Collier and Crowell. â¢ ..
As . ex refther college has its complete
team picked. Berkeley will probably be
lepresented by three men, while Stanford
will pin its faith to. but two. Of these
Harry Wiehe is fully as clever as any of
the men of the rival college, but Cleve
Iiaker, his team mate, has had practically
no tournament experience. He put in the
last week practicing on the local courts,
and on Thursday made a fair showing
against Grant Smith. He- has an aggres
sive style, but is a trifle wild.
In doubles Wlehe and Baker have haa
r^o practice together, and while they have
a chance it is not considered by many to
be a good one. Wiehe is a tower of
strength in doubles, and if his inexperi
enced partner gives him fair support a
good match will surely result. The match
oetween Baker and the second Berkeley
man is almost sure to go to the latter.
At Berkeley the experts are busily en
gaged In the singles try-out. Â£Â¦ Reuben
.Hunt is in great iorm at ' present and
caused quite a surprise last week by
beating tbree of the best men in college
in straight sets. Fred Brown was thougnt
to have a good chance against Hunt, but
the latter beat him easily. Hunt also dis
posed of MacGavin in rather easy fash
ion. Trowbridge Hendrick, the academic
champion of Southern California, made by
far the best showing against Hunt, and
many are of the opinion that he would
have won had he been in. practice. He
has not touched a racket for several
months, having devoted all his spare time
to baseball. This match was also won by
Hunt in straight sets, but they were all
close. Hunt and George Baker will be the
doubles team, and the former will be first
man on the singles. MacGavin, Brown,
Hendrick and Baker will; fight it out for
the one remaining place on the singles
team. .>-. ' /' - ,' Â¦. . .- ' i 'Â¦

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 4.â
Progress on the baseball diamond
during the week has been highly
gratifying, both to Coach Swindells
and the college fans.
The improvement in fielding, hitting and
general ; form has been particularly
marked since the first game with the San
Francisco league â¢ team when the varsity
was defeated by the score of 14 to 3. In
the contest with the alumni nine the var
sity players took a brace and played an
almost errorless game. When they met
the San Francisco ball-tossers again on
Thursday the leaguers were forced to put
up their best game and/ then, won by a
narrow margin. / . - -
The cardinal team, despite the {act that
it is composed largely of new men, will
go into tne first Intercollegiate game to
morrow on its own field prepared to make
California play an errorless game , if it
expects to win.',,
The throwing of the Stanford players
shows a remarkable Â¦ improvement over
me erratic throws made early In the sea
son, 'mis Â¦ is especially noticeable in
Blake's throwing from first base and
Catcher McGilvr ay s throwing to second.
In infield. playing Captain Cowden leads
and he is also well up in the batting liat.
Brown,- at center, easily the best o. the
outfield trio, covers ground in fine shape
and is a sure man on high fly balls.
Btanf ora's training on the tracK. has
been a continued series of misfortunes.
Sprained ankles and broken bones seem
to pursue the cardinal runners. The first
to drop out was Sprague, the crack
cross-country and distance man, who
underwent an operation ior appendicitis.
Then North, the hurdler, broKe a leg
while practicing on the. apparatus in the
gymnasium, beach, '05, and Whitaker,
04, pole vaulters, were also laid up with
broken bones. Nichols, the best man
Stanford had in the weights, succumbed
to an attack of paralysis. The greatest
misfortune.vso _ar as Stanford's prospects
in -: the intercollegiate field day were con
cerned came on Junior day, .when Arthur
S. Henley, '04, injured his ankle while
high jumping. From present indications
Henley will'not be able to enter the inter
collegiate meet- in .any. of his events,
which means a loss of from eight to thir
teen points for the cardinal. . .
Berkeley Prospects Axe' Bright.'
BERKELEY, April 4.â The preliminary
games of the University of .California
baseball nine have, as a whole, augured
well for the outcome of the contests with
Stanford University. Considerable con
fidence is expressed by the local ball
tossers and tney expect to have the larg
er figure on their side of the score. Those
who will go into the game to-morrow are:
Overall, pitcher; Hatch, catcher; Hen
dricks, first base; Braly, second base;
Kennedy, third base; Heitmuller, left
field; . Hamlin, center field; McKeown,
right field; Williams, pitcher and fielder.
The season's- work has been satisfac
tory. Old players have showed a steady
improvement in form and there are some
surprisingly good men who will play on
the varsity for the first time this year.
So far fourteen games have been played,
out of which three have been lost. Of the
defeats two games were iost by scores of
one only. 'Â¦.'Â¦Â¦
Orvall Overall, pitcher, has already
played two seasons on the nine, this mak
ing his - third. He does splendid work In
the. box and hold_ his opponents down to
few hits. Williams will also go in the
box,' but Overall will stand the brunt of
the work there. AVilliams is a compara
tively new man and already pitches In a
style practically up to Overall's.
G. G. Hatch,. the catcher, is a freshman
and this is his first year on the varsity.
He has held this position since the first of
the season, for no one at college can come
up to his work behind the bat.
T. W. Hendricks, another freshman,
will play at first base. He Is a good hitter
and clever at fielding.
H. H. Braly will hold down the second
bag. This is his third year on the team.
He is a strong batter but is liable to er
rors through carelessness.
L. J. Kennedy, who was in the out field
last year, will- play at third base. /
AV. W. Adams will be at short stop. He
is a good hitter and although one of the
youngest men on the team this is his sec
ond year on the varsity.
T. L. Hamlin, captain of the nine, has
been playing center field this season. He
is a reliable man. *
\V. F. Heitmuller is another freshman
of promise. He fields well at left and is
probably the hardest hitter on the team.
Arthur McKeown is back at right field
after an accident in whlch_he dislocated
his hip while sliding bases.
Teams Will Meet on the

sented by Eight Expert
Wielders of the Brassie
The schedule of the ladles* annex of
the San Francisco Golf Club has been
played out, the last events set-down be
ing the driving and putting contests, both
of which were won by Mis3 Sara Drum
last Monday.
The San Rafael Golf Club will open the
season this morning with the prelimin
ary rounds over eighteen holes of a com
petition for men and women. The women
will play at 9:30 a. m. and at 1:30 p. m.
the men will begin. The teams will be
made up from the scores handed in for
the preliminary rounds, those standing
first, fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth,
thirteenth constituting one team and those
ranking second, third, sixth, seventh,
tenth, eleventh, fourteenth making up tho
other team. In the match play rounds
No. 1 will play No. 2, No. 3 will play
No. 4, No. 5 will play No. 6 and so on.
All matches must be played out and tho
side scoring the most holes will be tha
winner, the three members of the win
ning team who win by the most up receiv
ing prizes. If a player defaults he will
be reckoned as losing 2 down. No prizo
will be given to a player who wins by de
fault.
I The exact order of the men in, the two
team3 la not given in the foregoing 4ist3.
It was at one time suggested that tha
disagreement which arose about the
match between the class B teams of the
two clubs would spread to the class A
contests, but fortunately this surmise haa
proved incorrect. The clas3 A contests
have now been held several times and
their conditions are well understood. The
dissension between the captains of the
class B teams arose from the fact that
the conditions were not clearly defined at
first and one of the captains refused to
accept the precedent set in class A
matches or in the class B contest held last
year. On the present occasion Captain
Orestes Pierce selected the Oakland team
and Captain S. I_ Abbot Jr. chose tne
representatives of the San Francisco. Golf
Club.
John Lawson, H. C. Golcher, S. L. Ab
bot Jr., "Warren Gregory, Dr. T. G. Mc-
Conkey, H. M. Hoyt, G. B. Cooksey and
L. O. Kellogg.

Golf Club will be:

C B. Hubbard, J. P. Ames and Arthur
Goodall.

the show.

the running and then finished third.
Jackpon was much criticized for his ride
on Varro, the 3 to 5 favorite for the mile
and a sixteenth selling event. It was
claimed by spectators that Jackson pur
posely allowed his mount to swerve in
behind Gawaine and True Blue, the last
sixteenth. This was an injustice, for the
horse was tired beyond question and bore

from the wire Varro looked beaten, and
at the wire Gawaine led him out not quite
a length in 1:48Â«4-
Saul of Tarsus, the 9 to 5 favorite, won
the concluding six-furlong spin. Jackson
had him in front almost from the first

Grand American Handicap Has
Beached the Tenth Hound of*
'the Shoot-Off. .
KANSAS CITY, April 4.â Thirty-three
wing shots made a straight score of
twenty-five birds to-day In the Grand

tenth round of the shoot-off fourteen men
remained who had not yet missed a bird.
The shooting stopped at the end of the

rOUSTEEN GUNMEN HAVE
UOT MISSED A PIGEOX
PHICAGO, April 4.â Joe "U'alcott, the
welter-weight champion, and Fred
U Russell of Minneapolis went Six
rounds to a draw here to-night, -..us
sell, who is a . heavy-weight, and a
big one at that, was unable , to do any
thing with Walcctt. and it certainly
seemed the latter was entitled to the ver
dict, having forced the fighting through
out. Â¦ ...
When the men shaped for action there
was such a disparity in their sizes that
the affair looked ridiculous, Walcott s
head just reaching Russell's waistline.
The men had fought but a minute, how
fever, when it was plainly evident the lit
tle negro was perfectly able to cope /with
his big opponent, and rather enjoyed
holding up Russell's 225 pounds when they
clinched. Before the round ended W al
cott dropped Russell with a right to the
jaw. In order to land the blow Walcott
had to jump off his feet fully six inchts.
Russell took a count of nine seconds and
rose to his feet groggy. Walcott worked
like a beaver to finish the fight, but the
bell gave Russell a much needed rest. He
was in fair shape at the beginning of the
next round.
He appeared timid during the next four
rounds and kept well covered, but man
aged to land several hard swings on Wal
cott's head. Walcott paid little attention
to Russell's efforts and kept Siamming
away for the latter's ribs with both
hands. Walcott tried for a knockout sev
eral times, but missed by a narrow mar
gin. In the last round Walcott reached
Russell's stomach with a number of hard
swings, and had the big fellow so weak
that, although weighing nearly 100 pound3
less, he was able to push Russell all over
the ring when they came to a clinch.

As a matter of fact it has never been at all likely
that any considerable number of Republicans would
be in favor of sacrificing the canal bill to any other
measure no matter how important it may be. The
country has for so long a timebeen eager to see the
construction of the great waterway begun that - it
would be a gross political blunder for the party now
in power to postpone the work merely because some
other bill could not be carried. Up to this timejjthe
enterprise has never been looked upon as a partisan
one, nor a sectional one. It has been studied from
a broad national standpoint, and the people would
never approve of the conduct of any statesman !in.
either House who would imperil.it for the sake of
doing politics for some pet measure of his own.
REPORTS from Washington to the effect. that
friction between the House and the Senate
would probably lead to a postponement of
action on the isthmian canal bill have been promptly
refuted. Senator chairman of the Republi

been made for taking up the canal bill at an early
date and giving.it the right of way. ; Other Senators
have indorsed the statement, and it'seems agreed by

It is that feeling of loyalty to the interests of the
party and to the welfare of the State that explains
the vigor with which the Republican press is de
nouncing Billy Herrin's programme at this early
stage of the campaign. As the Pomona Times has
expressed it: "Every Republican on principle wants
his party to win in the coming election, but there are
thousands of Republicans on principle who would
welcome defeat with Gage the nominee for Gov
ernor."
With those and other facts before them Republi
cans perceive clearly that if Billy Herrin carries out
his scheme and Gage be renominated the party will
enter the campaign heavily handicapped. It was
possible to elect Gage once, because the people did
not know him, and because they believed him when
he said he had no affiliations with the railroad bosses
but now the people know him well, and they do not
believe him any more. They have tried him and
they have found him to be false, tricky, narrow
minded, egotistical and vicious. Such a man can
not be re-elected, and as a consequence the most
earnest and loyal Republican papers in the State are
engaged in rousing the rank and file in opposition
to the scheme of the bosses so that the party may
not suffer from their domination.
institutions of the State have not been turned over
to political henchmen for nothing. By the judicious
distribution of that patronage Billy Herrin has been
able to relieve the railway treasury of a considerable
charge and make a showing of economy to please the
new directors.
Stalwart Republicans have noted the significance
of the fact that Gage's campaign is being conducted
under the direction of Billy Herrin, a railroad Demo
crat, and is being supported mainly by the notorious
yellow journal of this city, which always professes to
be Democratic. Working with Herrin are a set of
bosses such as KeDj, Burns, Crimmins, Burke and
Lynch, who entered the Republican party as burglars
enter a bank for what they can make out of it. They
have made a good deal out of it since Gage has been
in office, and observant Republicans are well aware
of the fact. The Normal Schools and the charitable
The scheme would have worked all right, perhaps,
had it not been for the fact that the people have
learned by experience that Billy Herrin and Gage
will bear watching at all times and all seasons, and
consequently are never wholly blind to what the
clever pair are doing. The activity of the bosses
attracted attention months ago. In fact, ever since
Dr. Osborn was removed from the Home for
Feeble-Minded Childien, and that institution turned
over to the control of a worthless and discredited tax
eater, the public has' been alert to find out the cause
of that deal 2nd the object for which it was carried
put They soon perceived that it was a part of a
plan to j.ut all State institutions into the spoils of
politics end xist them as a means of rewarding poli
ticians who do the work of the bosses. Furthermore
they perceived that the chief work required of the
henchmen just now is that of fixing things for Gage.
Since that discovery was made voices of protest
have been heard all over the State. They have come
from men of all parties and have been not only fre
quent but emphatic They have been accompanied in
the main by clear statements of reasons why Gage
should not be renominated, and the reasons have
been drawn invariably from the record Gage has
made in efnee. In ro instance has there been any
review of his private record, or any revelation made
of his methods of getting a start in life. He has
been judged exclusively as an official, and upon his
official acts he has been condemned.
T x T HEN Billy Herrin and his gang of allied
\/\/ i-fid subservient bosses undertook early in
Â¦^."â¢â¢'T tn e J'ear to arrange for the renomination of
Gage they doubtless thought the scheme could be
carried out before the people were aware of what had
been going on. The idea was not altogether fool
ith. The great mass of the people during the winter
sre busy with their own affairs and pay little atten
tion to a political campaign which is not to be for
mally opened until the middle of summer. Such
being the case it was natural the bosses should deem
it possible for them to "fix things" before the cam
paign begins and get possession of "the works"
while the people were not watching.

A writer in the Fortnightly Review discusses the
rapid advance in trade, and industry Â¦ that has been
made by protective tariff countries like the United
States and Germany/ and contrasts .their successes
with thâ¬ comparative stagnation in" Great Britain.
He-asserts that if the policy of free trade has not al
ready collapsed by reason of the pressure put upon
British industries by American and German compe
tition, the development and exploitation of China by
European and American capital will- "strain it to the
breaking point." It will be impossible, he says, for
Britain to hold open the door for trade in the prov
inces of .China that ; are within her "sphere of in
fluence" when her own trade is shut out of provinces
controlled by Russia, France and Germany.
Whether anything like a grab game for Chinese
trade is likely to take place in -the near future is
questionable, but it is not to be., disputed that free
trade so. far as if has been tested has proven 'to be a
failure. At the present time prosperity and progress
are with the protective tariff nations, and not with
the exemplar of freedom of trade. . Even in I ; Great
Britain, a considerable and increasing number of
people perceive that fact clearly enough. The writer
in the Fortnightly says : "The rank and file of the
Conservative . party, -. predominant . in influence to a
degree unprecedented in our history, is almost to a
man protectionist; among its leaders only one re
tains the reputation of a convinced free-trader."
It- is the argument of the British protectionists that
free trade is beneficial only when practiced within an
empire, jind that as against foreign competition there
must be protection: Thus the writer says: "It must
not be forgotten that the free trade of other nations
has proceeded almost entirely on lines analogous to
these, the breakdown of local and interstate tariffs
and the substitution of national or imperial tariffs.
The great areas of internal free trade, which we term
France and the United States, represent the rule in
modern history. It has long been doubtful whether
Great. Britain could hold out in her solitary career;
it is now; tolerably certain that she will "collapse to
the inherent logic which binds imperialism to pro
tection."
WHILE the nations of the earth are profusely
pledging themselves and one another to the
maintenance free and unrestricted trade
in China, there is growing up in Great JBritain a set
of skeptics who frankly declare the conviction that
the open door will not remain open, and .that free
trade in Asia is a commercial impossibility. The
skeptics are of course the men. who are. clamoring
for protection in Great Britain itself, and it is not to
be denied that their clamoring is.made impressive at
times by the statement- of very reasons
for their lack of faith. â¢ .

After all the platform pledges, an the talk
about watered stock, and of corrupt practice*
on the part of the water compaijjt the revenna
of that corporation has been on a continual in
crease. The first water ordinance passed by
the last board yielded over $130,000 more than
was intended. The second one Is yielding over
$200,000 more than was intended and the pres
ent one will unquestionably yield an increase of
at least $130,000. The revenue f->r the next
fiscal year will be nearly $2,000,000. B For every
dollar paid in taxation the people will have to
add a half dollar for water. Our water is the
costliest In the world, and getting costlier evry
year. Surely public control by the City Fathers
is a public folly, leading only to successive fail
ures In every attempt to regulate or control
the revenues of the water corporation. Is n
not high time to try public ownership.? Â¦
Â¦ . , CHARLES WESI4BT REED.
Ean Francisco, April 4. - ,.-,-â¢Â¦.â¢*â¢
Another element of humor Is the assevera
tion of the proponents of the* new waiter ordi
nance that It was necessary to increase the rev
enue of the . water compaziy because' thÂ»
former ordinances were unfair' when' the fig
ures lying on their table at ''the' moment of
making: the statements showed that thÂ» water
company is securing an increased revenue.
An element of humor is Injected Into the
controversy by the fact that the Spring Valley
Water .Works Is actually suing; in the United
States courts to set aside tfce ordinance under
which It Is at thl3 moment collecting revenue,
on the ground that its revenue has been greatly
reduced, while the figures submitted by Its own
secretary demonstrates that there will' be an
actual increase of 6ver $3O,C0O for the fiscal
year. I have always thought this suit was noth
ing more than a "bluff," designed to frighten
the new board Into allowing an. increased reve
nue. It will now be conveniently dsopped.
The increase in revenue was partly ths re
sult of new business, but the real reason Is that
the water order is based on a form incise for
twenty years past, which contains many elastic
schedules, and Is so complex that hardly any
ratepayer can tell what he should' be charged
by an inspection of the ordinance. Thus it la
that the water company increases Ita revenue at
will, in the face of attempts on the part of Su
pervisors to give relief to the people.
The new Board of Supervisors tried its
prentice hand at fixing water rates last month
and has increased the revenue of the Spring
Valley Water Works, because, as avowed by
Supervisors in public debate, the water com
pany ha,d been treated unfairly, and its reve
nues had been improperly reduced by the,. oM
board. The Increase allowed was only $lÂ»i,0f)O
on hydrant rates, but. as already shown, i* â¢Â»
revenue from the present water ordinance will
be greater than the preceding one, although it
was expected that the revenue would be de
creased $142,000. In other words,' during the
present fiscal year the Spring Valley Water
Works ha3 found a way to squeeze over $20<>,
000 more out of the people than the Supervisors
designed to pllow and If the same rate of in
crease prevails for the next fiscal year' the In
crease In the revenues will be__over $159,0()Q,
without considering the Increased revenue al
lowed by the Supervisors.
Water Order Confuses Eate-Payers.
In 1CC1 the same board again triea to reduce
the revenue of the company, This time it made
a clean cut of ?1J2.CCO in the hydrant rates
paid Â¦ by thÂ» city. It was thought that this
would certainly make a reduction ln_ the reve
nue of the company, but the testimony adduced
at the recent investigation from the mouth of
Secretary j Ames of the Spring Valley Water
Works shows that for the first half of the pres
ent fiscal year (which ends July 1. 1001), the
water company, has actually collected" $056,577.
which, being mutliplied by two, wilt make; thÂ«
revenue for the fiscal yoi'r $1,013,154: .: Secretary
Ames testified two years ago that the receipts
for the second half of the 'fiscal year were
usually greater than for the first half, so that
the figures given are conservative. The . first
ordinance passed by the Ia3t board produced
9^883^83X0; the second one. will produce
$1,013,154. an increase of ?39,270 00 more than
the first ordinance, although it was designued
to reduce the revenue of the company by $142.
000. The last Board of Supervisors twice at
tempted to reduce the revenue of J the water
company, but that corporation succeeded in col
lecting |130,CC0 more than was anticipated the
first year, and will succeed in collecting $'200.
000 more this year than was intended to be al
lowed.
EDITOR THE CALL.: The passage of
the new water ordinance by the Board
of Supervisors illustrates the. futility of
public control in dealing with the water
question In San Francisco. The hew ordinance
Increases the revenue of the Spring Valley
Water ' Work3 without reason.' As 'ons of the
Supervisors said at the time of it3 passase: "It
is a complete surrender to the water company."
The predecessors of the present board went
into office on the high tide of reform. The plat
form which all the majority Supervisors signed
pledged them to "institute a searching" investi
gation of the operating expenses, and into the
real value of the water company's, property
used for the water supply of this city, and to
allow net more than 5 per cent on the stock
representing said real value thus determined."
The board fixed its first water order without
any investigation other than a perfunctory one.
but attempted to carry out its pledses by malt
ing a 10 per cent cut in the household rates.
The Water Committee in Its report recommend
ing the ordinance recited that "this effects a
reduction to the ratepayers of the city of ap
proximately $134.CCO, and a corresponding di
minution on the basis of last year's rates."
The last year's ratssâ i. e.. the 1 fiscal year end-
Ing July 1. 18S0, yielded to the water company
$1,S75,C02 S7, while the ordinance that tha
committee recommended yielded $1.853;8S3 10 â
a reduction of onl> $21,2CÂ» 27 in the Income of
the company, instead of a reduction of 51^4,-

During the. discussion of the remount scandals in
the British Parliament there was no attempt to con
ceal the fact: of this American trade in contraband
of war. It was admitted, . and the financial scandal
impinged upon it was even thrown back upon some
of our own horse and cavalry experts, supposed to
be connected with oar military service.
We see no way of stopping it. Men engaged in
trading contraband of war to the Cuban insurgents
were arrested by our executive and tried in the Fed
eral courts of Florida and other places in "the South.
But their rights had to go before a jury, and no mat
ter what the evidence was they were acquitted and
went right back to their profitable contraband traf
fic. As we have often said in connection with the
observance of our treaties and international obliga
tions, if the people will not keep the national faith
unbroken and the national honor spotless it is not
in the power of an administration -to do so.
It is no doubt, true also that" if the question were
brought into serious solution the" claim would, at
once be made that England; having annexed the
South African republics, their existence has ceased
and they have ho claim to belligerent rights, and are
not under protection of neutrality treaties nor of the
neutral provisions and principles - of international
law. It is upon that theory that Kitchener shot
1 Scheepcrs and other Boer prisoners. They are held
to have no international rights nor any appeal to the
laws of war as laid down in the Geneva convention.
It is exceedingly doubtful whether the United
States could successfully, dispute this contention.
We have just assumed the same position as to the
Filipinos. General Funston used forgery and the
enemy's uniform to entrap Aguinaldo, and it is given
cut by our War Department that he had a right to
do both, because the 'Filipinos are merely insur
gents, and we recognize in their case no uniform,
and in dealing with them are not bound by the
Geneva convention' nor by our own articles of war.
It will be seen that this ruling not only decides that
we violate no neutral rights by recruiting Great Brit
ain's military strength, but it is also timely as an ac
quittal in advance of Lieutenant Waller for the
shooting of helpless Filipino prisoners.
None of this is pleasant and most of it is\ revolt
ing to a sense of justice, but it is among the appall
ing incidents of war and is a warning to the weak to
bear much and suffer and be patient before raising
their hands against the strong, for they have no
treaty rights, nor rights founded in the law of na
tions. As for their general rights as- human beings,
these are not any more respected by those who can
afford to disrespect them than rights derived frofn
the law. ,
AS a matter of sentiment the question of neu
trality in the Boer war may be of much con
sequence. '" ---.,-;..
The terms of our treaty, of neutrality, are very plain;
They recite that: "A neutral Government is bound
not to permit or suffer either belligerent to make
use of its ports or waters as the base of naval opera
tions against the other, or for the purpose of the re
newal or augmentation of military supplies, or arms,
or the recruitment of men." '
The day after we declared war against Spain Vic
toria issued her proclamation of neutrality/which
was up ;o the sternest requirements of our treaty of
1871 and to the general rules of international law.
In this she was followed by the other powers.
Hawaii, which was then an independent republic,
flagrantly violated her neutrality obligations by fur
nishing port facilities to our navy, supplies of all
kinds, and permitted the landing and sojourn upon
her "soil of our military forces. But Spain was a weak
power, and the act of Hawaii was in our favor, and
we are" a strong power. Weak powers have no rights
which the strong are bound to respect. :When the
South African war was young British warships seized
several cai goes of American flour en route to Lo
renzo Marquez, and consigned there to Portuguese
and French merchants, claiming that it was destined
for the Beers and was contraband of war. The prop
erty was released only upon her failure to prove that
its destination was the Transvaal or Orange FreV
'.State. ... Â¦ Â¦"; 'Jl>:>
Since then nearly 200,000 American mules and
horses have been bought for remounts and draught
purposes in South Africa and. have been delivered to
British agents a: New Orleans, where a detention
and shipment establishment is maintained and
whence they are shipped to Cape Town. Wharton's
International Law says: "Horses and their furni
ture are contraband of war," following our treaty
with France in 1778. Hill's International Law says:
"Horses are generally considered as contraband of
war and are so mentioned in many treaties between
different slates."
It is beyond controversy that we are violating neu
tral rights by permitting this renewal of Great Brit
ain's military, supplies. In extenuation it must be ad
mitted that we became hardened to such acts dur
ing the Cuban rebellion, ..which was" managed by a
junta quartered in New York and was supplied with
arms and munitions of war from every one! of our
Southern ports. But there, again, the" party injured
was a weak power and our people had no respect for
its international rights

COOK DECAMPS
WITH DAUGHTER
The notice to move was served upon
Mrs. Brown and Miss Brown in a sum
mary manner, but they laughed the mat
ter off and tried to pay rent in advance. :
Then a happy thought struck the land
lord. When the school opened a couple of
nights ago and the twenty-six juvenile
W BURNARD, property own
er, has discovered a noveV
and effectual method of
O ejecting tenants. He fol
lows the example of the
farmer who wishes to part company with
a convention of hornets, only he goes the
farmer one better and uses sulphur fumes
instead of smoke."
Some time ago Mrs. Brown and Miss
Brown rented the premises at 1 935 "Wash
ington street from Burnard and . an
nounced their Intention of opening an in
stitution for the education of the Chinese
youth. When their determination to es
tablish the school, became known to the
landlord he seriously objected,"- but hi3
protests, even to the police at the Central
Station, were without avail
Landlord Burnard lives in a fiat overhead
and nightly was obliged to listen to the
glibbering of the heathen youth below,
while he paced the flexor and -said things.
But Burnard, in the parlance of the ca
naille, was "up against it." He had rent
ed the premises and the only way to rid
himself of the nuisance and restore his
,peace of mind was to lose Mrs. Brown
and Miss Brown as neighbors.
The landlord's methods have been ef
fective, though,* despite police interfer
ence. His tenants will move. "We got
our class out yesterday," said Miss
Brown, "and will soon find .another place
of residence. We could endure the man
dates to quit the premises, but this last
scheme of getting smoked out Is a bigger
pill than we can swallow, so we will
move on." . â¢ \
"Bubonic plague!" shouted the pupils In
consternation. "The Board of Health is
here again." Then they made a wild exit
and thought of the dose of serum and the
bluecoats on blockade duty, i .
f Policeman Tom Handley was called to
interrupt the stampede. He found the
landlord burning sulphur In the basement
and the suffocating fumes pouring up
ward through holes in the ; floor of ! the
Chinese school. The policeman held sev
eral moments of stormy conversation with
the landlord and threatened him. with ar
rest if he should use the "smoke-out" pro
cess again. â¢ , â¢ ( â¢
"They drive m* crazy," ' said Burnard
last night. V'You would think' the shack
was a houseboat on the Yangtse-KIang
and that fourteen highbinder tongs were
trying to argue with the Six Companies;
and my sorrows do not stop there. They
have Chinese signs pasted up all over the
windows and the house is often mistaken
for an opium joint. Every day heathens
are ringing the doorbell, trying to rent
rooms and all my friends are steering to
the other side of the street." â¢ â¢ -
pigtails were lined up for rollcall a fright
ful odor permeated the room.
Mr. Lowe, however, after due considera
tion of his many interests in Mendocino
County -decided that he would not accept
the offer. â¢ The action on the part of the
Baltimore syndicate in offering the place
to Mr. Lowe clearly demonstrates that
when they take active charge of the road
they will place new; officials in nearly all
the positions of any. importance.
From good authority it is stated that
James Lowe of Hopland was, recfently of-,
fered by the Baltimore syndicate the po
sition of superintendent of construction
of the United Railroads. The position is
at present held by H. H. Lynch, who was
promoted to the post by the old Market
Street Railway directors several months
ago. ' >

Baltimore Syndicate Shows Intention
OFFEBS LOWE POST \
OF SUPERINTENDENT
Assistant United States Attorney Mc-
Kinley says that there is no merit in
Mains' contention, the Revised Statutes,
section 1014, applying only to arrest, irn
prisonment and bailing for trial, and cov
ers only the proceedings before the Court
Commissioner. -*ti the Dimmick case more
than thirty days had expired between the
quashing: of the first indictment and the
finding of the second, yet George D. Col
lins, his attorney, did not attempt to make
any point on that fact- Mains is a lawyer,
or rather has been admitted to the bar,
and has practiced as a lawyer, but he has
failed in his own case on almost every
motion that he has raised to avert a trial.
Mains served notice yesterday morning
on Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning to the effect that he would move in
the United States District Court for an
order dismissing the prosecution and ask
ing for his discharge because thirty days
have elapsed since the order holding him
to answer was made before the Federal
Grand Jury and no Indictment or Infor-"
motion against him had been filed. Mr.
Banning informed the court that he. had
received the notice of 'motion and that
Mains was not present in court.
Mrs. Mains, vÂ»ue of the defendant, was
present and filed on his behalf the mo
tion referred to. Mains cites from the
United States Revised Statutes to show
that the State law governs in procedure
in cases of this kind, and that the law of
California specifies that when a person
has been held to answer for a public of
fense, if an indictment !s not found or an
information filed against him within thirty
days thereafter, he shall be discharged.
Judge de Haven deferVed action on the
motion. The Grand Jury was Investigat
ing the case of Mains yesterday.
Mr. Benas telephoned fcr Marshal Shine,
who appeared shortly afterward with. Dep
uty Marshal Gamble, whereupon Mains
asked for information as to the authority
under which he was held. Marshal Shine
replied that he was acting under order ot
United States District Judge de Haven,
that he was going to take Mains to jail
and did- not intend to have any nonsense
about it either. The prisoner seeing that
he had in Marshal bnine a determined
men to deal with, meekly held up his
hands, while Deputy Gamble placed the
handcuffs on his wrists, and he went
lamblike to jail.
Charles R. Mains, who is held in custody
by the United States I authorities on the
charge of being connected with a four bil
lion dollar myth syndicate operating
through the postofflce, made a foolish ex
hibition of himself shortly after 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon in the office of the
United States Marshal. . When Deputy
Marshal Benas announced that he was
ready to take him back to the County
Jail, Mains declared that he. would .not
budge a step; that he was being unlaw
fully held a prisoner, and that the Mar
shal had no authority to hold, him.
Â¦ On the way up the prisoner was a model
of propriety- and so won the confidence
of his guardian that the customary hand
cuffing was dispensed with. Shortly after
the two boarded the ferry at- Vallejo
Junction the prisoner walked forward as
though to get a better view of the de
lightful scenery" and suddenly plunged
overboard. He swam to shore without
difficulty, and the last seen of him by the
chagrined oflicer was a dripping streak
of black disappearing over the. Port Costa
hills. The ferry-boat was backed to the
slip and Graham went ashore, but the, in
habitants would not aid in Â«the recanture
and as there was -nothing more .than a
moist trail to follow over thÂ« mountain
tops pursuit was abandoned. Graham had
his Â±rip to San Francisco all right, but
the Expenses, amounting to $60, including
railroad fare one way for a deceptive and
profitless prisoner, will be borne by the
officer himself. -
Policeman Charles . Graham of the Los
Angeles department is mourning the loss
of a prisoner who abruptly, left his care
yesterday shortly after boarding the ferry
at Vallejo Junction on the way to Mare
Island. Last week Graham's eagle eye
chanced to " light upon a well-dressed
.stroller in the southern metropolis and he
at once marked him as ' a deserter from
the United States steamship Independ
ence, of whom a description had been sent
out.--. He an" ected the \arrest and planned
a little trip to San Francisco. at the Gov
ernment's expense, expecting that In re
turn for handing over' the deserter to the
authorities at 'Mare Island he would \be
recouped for money expended on the trip
and receive $20 reward additional.

A PESTIFEROUS GERM.
Burrows TJp the Scalp Into Dandruff
- and Saps thÂ« Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that It is the result
of dandruff, which is caused by a pestif-
erous parasite burrowing 1 up the scalp as
It dins down to the sheath in which the
hair is fed in the scalp. Before long the
hair root is shriveled up and the hair
drops out. If the work of the germ Is not
destroyed, hair keeps thinning till bald-
ness comes. The only way to cure dan-
druff is to kill the germ, and until now
there has been no hair preparation that
would do it; but to-day, dandruff is easily
eradicated by Newbro's. Herpicide., which
makes hair glossy and soft as silk..

A Denver j Colorado, Young Woman
recently Wrote a Letter to Mrs.
Pinkliam, which Aptly Pictures the
Condition of a Great Many Young
Women. Read What She Says: .
"Deae Mrs. Pdtkham; â This is the first opporttmity I have fotmd to
write and thank you for the good your Vegetable Compound has done me.
I feel better than I have for years. It seems a 'seven days' wonder 1 to my
friends. Where I used to be' pitied, everything is the opposite now, and there
is not a day but some one wants to know what I have done to make myself
look so well.' â¢ .-
"Before taking- Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound I had
constant headaches, -was constipated, bloated, eyes weak and watery, bearing-
down pains, pains in the small of my back and right side; took cold very
easily, which always caused intense pain in the ovaries, and I did not want
to go anywhere or see any one. I was called cross, but 1 could not help it,
feeling as I did. I could not lift anything or do any hard work without
suffering for days afterwards. Menstruation lasted for eight or ten days,
the first three orfour days being almost constant pain day and night."
Nothing in this wide world has relieved so much female suffering
A Richmond Girl's Experience.
"Dear Mrs. Pdtkham: â I have just purchased a bottle of Ijydia EÂ«
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound but am advised to write you before
treating myself.
"I hardly know how to express myself. At times I feel well, and in less
than ten minutes I am actually wretched with headache, that tired feeling,
and so nervous that the sound of a door bell will make me start. I cannot
Tvalk two blocks without feeling fatigued. Menstruation has never been
regular, have a slight discharge of leucorrhoea. I would like your advice,
and sincerely hope I may find relief in your medicine." â Miss Clara Poetk-
17IG, Richmond, Va. (Oct. 26, 1900.)
Statement No. 2. "*
" Dear Mrs. Peskham : â It gives me great pleasure to thank you for tha
benefit 1 received from your Vegetable Compound.
" When 1 wrote to you I could not go up-stairs or walk a hundred yards
Â¦without being completely fagged out, but to-day I can easily walk two miles.
I was also very nervous and suffered from a misery in my back but these
troubles arc all a thing of the past. I was at a loss to describe my feelings,
but now thanks to your. Vegetable Compound I am a well woman.
:. ''I advise all suffering women to write to Mrs. Pinkham, and I shall never
fail to recommend your remedies to my friends." â Miss Clara Poetewio,
Richmond, Va. . (March 26, 1901.) * t\ 'â¢
Miss Thompson's Pains are Cured.
*â¢ Dear Mrs. Pinkham : âI want to tell you what I^ydia E. Pinkham'S
Vegetable Compound has done for me. For several years I had suffered
with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, palpitation of the heart,
headache, pains in nearly all parts of the body. My physician said it was ;
only indigestion, but bis medicine did not help me any. I began the use ot
yottr Vegetable Compound. I have taken four bottles and now those troubles
are cured. " cannot praise it enough."â Miss Belle S. Thompson, Box 14, \

ST.' JOSEPH, Mo.,'ApriI 4.â Although a
score of officers are working on the case,
no clew has thus far been | found that is
likely to ; lead to the arrest of the four
robbers who hela up the Burlington train
three miles north of this city last night.
The railroad authorities assert that the
robbers got nothing, although on this
point conflicting reports are in circulation.
The scene of the 'attempted robbery is
very near the place where on the night
l0 Â£. ptember 24, .1893,- four young men of
this city made a futile attempt to rob a
Burlington train, two of the party being
shot down. On that occasion the railroad
authorities, under the leadership of W.
m Y. rown> then general manager of the
â¢Burlington's Missouri lines, ran a dummy
tra'n^, loaded with policemen and deputy
sheriffs, and the robbers were taken by
surprise, their plans having been divulged
by a, treacherous confederate.
The. robbers gained an entrance to the
express- car by compelling the engineer
to call to the express messenger and by
threats of blowing the door open with
dynamite. Ten shots were fired, one at
Conductor, Cox and several at Brakeman
Gaut, but .1 none took effect.
N The leader of the robbers !is described
by the train men as being about 35 years
?/â age< 1 ve feet ten> Inches tall, weight
160 pounds, voice loud and clear ; He
wore a long black mask of cloth, cover-
i n ?,. hls^ fa , ee from the forehead down and
falling below his chin. When he gave or
ders to the train men or to the other rob
bers every word he said could be heard
distinctly.- v - Â¦ -
The second robber is 40 years of age,
five.. feet TT nine inches tall, weight 140
pounds.^ He wore a black stiff hat- and *
dark red false beard. The third robber is
between 26 and 28 years of age, weight 150
pounds. He wore a long black mask. The
fourth man is between 22 and 24 years old
five feet seven .inches tall, weight about
15a pounds. He wore a black mask.

Conner, for the past three years. pastor of
the First Universalist Church, has resigned
and his resignation has been accepted.
His successor has not yet been chosen.
Rev. Mr. Conner two months ago an
nounced his resignation on Sunday in
church, giving as his reason that he could
not please the conflicting factions of the
church, which is composed of both Uni
tarians and Universalists. This came as
a great surprise to the congregation and
brought tears to the eyes of many of his
friends. A parish meeting was called, at
which It was voted by a heavy majority
not 'to accept the resignation. .To-day
Rev. Mr. Conner declared that his resig
nation must be accepted.
Pastor Insists Upon Resigning.
Chief of Police Wlttman was exceeding
ly annoyed by the publication yesterday in
an afternoon j paper of a totally unwar
ranted statement that a reassignment of
eighty officers of the department was con
templated. He said last night that no
such movement was contemplated and
that he had in mind no new assignments.
He was well pleased, he said, with the
smooth manner in which the department
was being conducted, and there was. not
the . slightest foundation for the report
of the shake- irp. As this - is a matter
that is" left entirely to the - Chief under
the policy of the present Police Commis

immediate changes are contemplated.

ble Scene He Witnessed
Near Manila.
STOCKTON, April. 4.â In a letter to
James A. Hunter of Lodi, Dr. G. H;
Locke; serving In the United States army
at Manila '" as chief veterinary, makes
some remarkable statements concerning
the continued prevalence of bull. fights
The veterinary declares that he witnessed
a scene a few months ago that caused his
hair to turn white. It was at a bull fight
and seven natives were killed within an
hour. Three were gored^to death-by the
enraged bull, and the ap
plauded at -the horrible .spectacle. .Three
were killed by being thrown â¢ from their
horses, one. of them being dragged . to
death, his foot having caught in the stir
rup.. During . the time - the , horse was
dragging the unfortunate victim the band
struck up a lively air. The last vlctlnY of
the day was killed by an accident. One of
the men threw a Javelin at the bull and it
went over the back . of the beast \and
struck a man in the breast. A, comrade
came dashing by, and, seelng>the wounded
man. dismounted. Drawing, a large-sized
revolver he beat him on the; head with
the butt of it until the unfortunate man
wa3 relieved by death.
Dr. Locke says that, these exhibitions
are given without the knowledge of the
head officials. . -

peace and resisting an officer. This Is the
sequel of a'gathering of students in front

Marshal Ramsey and Constable Campbell
to disperse them. The students at the
top of the staircase claimed that- they
were unable to. go down because of the
pressure of the crowd at the bottom. Cur
ry became exasperated and threw several
buckets of water down the stairway, and
the students retired.
Later in the evening eggs were thrown
at the building., ,,

rested, and warrants are still out for M.

A meeting, of the members of Carpen
ters' Union No. 22, which was recently
suspended by order of the executive board
of the national, organization, was held at
the Turk-street Temple. About 300 were
present. The meeting was called by Mr.
Grimes, who represents the national body.
It was decided by those present to form
a new union under. the national organiza
tion and give up their present charter. A
temporary organization was effected by i
the election of Frank Cranford as tempo-'
rary president and F. Durvln as tempo
rary secretary- The -members who paid

result the â¢ situation is -more complicated
than ever. Both sides, claim victory for
their respective sides.
The reassessment of the corporations
followed the campaign waged by the
Teachers' Federation of Chicago, the
teachers claiming that the corporations
were escaping just taxation. A writ of
mandamus issued by the Circuit Court
compelling the State Board of Equaliza
tion to make a new assessment for 1SO0,
â¢which would include the value of fran
chises and capital stock, was sustained
by the Supreme Court of the State. The
Federal court assumed jurisdiction in the
injunction cases on the ground that oth
erwise the corporations would be unjustly
deprived of their property.
The enforcement of this rule cuts the
original reassessment something over 52,
000.000.
The basis shall be the net earnings of the
several complainants for the year ending April
1. 1900. proper allowance being made for de
preciation and replacement, but not for ex
tension and reduced further by the additional
taxes that the enforcement of this rule pro
duces. Upon this basis the value of com
plainants' capital stock, including: franchises
And tangible property, shall be capitalized
upon a ratio of 6 per cent; this equalized by a
redaction of SO per cent and then divided by
five. L'poa this (capitalization) the tax shall
be extended at the true rate for 1900. exclusive
of interest and penalties, not to exceed 88 7-100
per cent, from which Bhall be subtracted the
taxes already paid, and the balance will bÂ»
the cum allowed.
The court holds that the taxing bodies
erred in taking the stock market values
of stocks for a taxing basis, holding that
the market values are largely fictitious.
The following is laid down by the court
es the proper determination of the reas
sessment for the year 1300:
The Union Traction Company, the Consoli
dated Traction Company, the South Chicago
Railway Company, the Chicago City Railway
Company, the Chicago Edison Company, the
People's Gas, Light and Coke Company and
the Chicago Telephone Company.
CHICAGO, April 4.â The decision of
Judges Grosscup and Humphrey of the
Federal court and District courts, re
spectively, in the injunction cases brought
by seven Chicago public utility corpora
tions to prevent the collection of taxes
assessed as a result of mandamus proceed
ings in the State courts some time ago,
was read from the bench by Judge Gross
cup to-day. It is in the nature of a com
promise. The court finds that the reas
sessment was from 30 to 40 per cent too
high on the stocks of the companies af
fected, but declines to enjoin the various
officials from collecting this extra money
until the corporations shall have paid in
the 60 or 70 per cent which the court re
gards as just. By this ruling the corpora
tions will hare to pay about $5,000,000 in
taxes before the injunction is issued. The
court appointed masters to determine the
exact amounts which should be collected.

lowing companies^

tlr.g Into your system and are not taking chances
with cocaine, opiates or similar poisons found
In so many catarrh cures and cough inedicines
Dr. Ramsdell, in commenting on catarrh
cures, says: *I can heartily recommend
Stuart s Catarrh Tablets, because they contain
no cocaine nor other dangerous drug found In
bo many advertised catarrh cures. I have
known of many cases of long standing catarrh
of the head and throat completely cured
by the daily uee of these tablets for several
weeks. One case in particular, which I could
not reach with an inhaler or spray and where
the catarrh caused daily headaches and a
noticeable loss of hearing, was entirely cured
by this harmless but effective remedy "
Dr. Wainwright says: "I never hesitate to
prescribe Btuarfs Catarrh Tablets for catarrbal
headaches and catarrnal deafness because- I
know them to be perfectly safe for child or
adult and have seen many remarkable cures
resulting from their regular dally use; because
they are advertised and sold In drug stores li
no reason why any rood physician should not
use them because we should seize upon the
means of cure wherever found.'*
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are especially vala-
atfle for catarrbal colds In children because they
ere pleasant to the taste and may be used
freely to break up severe colds and croup at
the very beginning.

showed that a peanut had lodged in the
windpipe and cut off' respiration. It had
eaten some peanuts that were lying on a
table in the room where it had been play
ing. The failure of the child to remove
the inner peel Â«of the peanut is supposed
to have caused the peanut to lodge In its

ERKELEY, April 4.â Mrs. Mary
. E.. Mulholland, wife of W. W.
Mulholland, a lumber surveyor,
who resides at 1609 Fifth street,
. West Berkeley, and her two chil
dren, were the victims of- a collision be
tween a runaway team and a street car
this morning and all met with serious in
juries. The accident occurred at "the cor
ner of University and San Pablo avenues,
where Mrs. Mulholland and her children
were sitting on an outside seat of a San
irablo avenue car, waiting for it to take
them to Oakland.
One of the children, Mamie, aged 10,
was struck by the heavy wagon pole. The
other Mabel, aged 8, narrowly . escaped
being impaled by the pole, and with her
sister and mother was swept to the
ground. All were badly bruised by the
fall and Mrs. Mulholland was cut by fly
ing glass. ,
Neither of these patriots ever collected
a cent. Alviso died in 1SS0, after vainly
trying to get reimbursement. His four
sons were left e<jual shares in the claim,
but they were never able to collect on It.
James A. Waymire bought three of the
interests and went to Mexico to collect
the claim, but all he could get was $22,ttX>
in Mexican securities that are worth less
than 50 cents on the dollar. His venture
cost him a good deal of money, as the ex
penses were too big for the income.
Guadaloupe Alviso. who did not sell his
share, tried to block the administration
of Augustino Alviso's estate, which has
been in probate twenty years, but he was
unsuccessful. Judge Ellsworth to-day
confirmed the final account and dis
charged the executor. Judge , Waymire
told the story of the loan.

My Dear Senator Hoar: I very earnestly
wish I could be at the meeting over which you
are to preside in honor of the eightieth birth
day of Edward Everett Hale. A classical allu
sion of comparison Is always very trite, but I
suppose all of us who have read the simpler
classical books think of Timoieon In bis days
at Syracuse, loved and honored in his old age
by the fellow-citiaens In whose service he" had.
spent the strength of his best years, as one of
the noblest and most attractive figures In all
history.
Dr. Hale is just such a figure now. We love
him and we revere him. We are prouder of
our citizenship because he Is our fellow-citizen,
and we feel that his life and hia writings both
alike spur us steadily to fresh effort toward
high thinking and right living. To have wrtt
ten "The Man Without a Country" by Itself
would be quite enough to make all the nation
his debtor. I belong in the innumerable army
of those who owe him much, and through you
I wish him Godspeed now. Ever faithfully
yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
BOSTON, April 4.â In a letter sent to
Senator George F. Hoar, expressing re
gret that he could not be present at. tho
public celebration of the eightieth birth
day of the Rev. Dr. Edward Everett Hale
in this city last evening. President Roose

President Says Nice Things About
ROOSEVELT'S TRIBUTE
TO EBOTARD EVERETT HALS
As the defendant offered to return the tools,
which offer was refused by Thayer unless the
tool-boxes were also returned. It Is necessary
to consider only plaintiff's claim to the tool
boxes.
The evidence shows that " tho tool-boxes in
question were made by two apprentices. Don
aldson and Williams, of material belonging to
the defendant, the Union Iron Works, and
during hours that Donaldson and Williams
Â¦were paid to devote to the service of the cor
poration. 1
Â¦Â¦As the material and time occupied In the
manufacture 'of the boxes belonged to the
Union Iron Works, the conclusion must follow
that the boxes on completion were the prop
erty of the defendant.
No doubt Thayer, the plaintiff, purchased
tho tool-boxes In good, faith from Donaldson
an* Williams, but as the apprentices never ac
quired any title other than . that which mer*
possession conferred upon them, Thayer'a
claim to the boxes must, fail on the assump
tion of ownership by the rightful owner, the
Union Iron Works.
"That no one can transfer to another a bet
ter title than he himself has. Is a maxim,"
says Chancellor Kent, "alike of tho common
and the civil law."
Justice of the Peace Daniels gave judg
ment yesterday in favor of the Union
Iron Works, which was sued by Oscar R.
Thayer, a minor, for $4 55. The action
was brought to recover possession of two
tool-boxes valued at $3 50, and levels and
miscellaneous tools- of the value of $105.
In his opinion Justice Daniels says:-
Possession Is Vested in Union
Iron Works. '
Justice of the Peace Daniels Decides
APPRENTICE BOY IS NOT
ENTITLED TO TOOL-BOXES
The Supreme Court to-day held that tho
absence of the perfected title was purely
technical and that Archbishop Ireland has
the right to sell the land In question. Pro
ceedings of ejectment will now be com
menced against the squatter settlers.
ST. PAUL, April 4.â The Supreme Court
to-day made Archbishop Ireland richer by
$200,000.. Ten years ago the Great North
ern selected certain public lands in Min
nesota under a land grant from the Gov
ernment as a bonus for the road. Short
ly thereafter Ireland bought 50,000 acres
of this land at H an acre. He Induced
many to settle on the land and sold it to
them at a nominal figure, promising to>
return the money if the title, which was
In doubt, should revert to the Govern
ment. Other settlers located on a portion
of this land, and when it was sought to
eject them a test case was brought in the
courts to determine the title. It appears
that the railroad never obtained deeds to
this land from the Government, and so
.the title and right of Ireland was ques
tioned.
Special Dispatch to The Call
It was annouriced at the university to
day tSÂ»4.t the students who had been
dropped from the college rolls for. not
being vaccinated would be allowed to re
turn after April 14, providing that no more
cases of smallpox developed. This order
affect3 more than 100 students who re
fused to obey the vaccination rule. An
instructor in jurisprudence, C. H. Boke,
was ill with poison oak at the time inoc
ulation was ordered, and as he could not
comply with it on that account he, too,
will have to remain from college classes
until Monday after next.
If a system of student control could be de
vised, such that it would be acceptable to the
faculty and the great maorlty of the student
body, would you give to it your active and
consistent support, thus pledging yourself .to
support the principle o f an honest examination,
and for thus pledging yourself to do every
thing in your power to stop the practice of
"cribbing" (cheating In examinations) wher
ever it may appear?
Do you favor vesting the entire control of
examinations in the student body?
Do you -favor vesting entire control of ex
aminations in the faculty?'
It was decided that on Monday and
Tuesday the question of student control
will be voted on by the students them
selves and an attempt be made to get an
"honor system" established at the univer
sity. The following questions will be
voted upon, and if a large majority of
the students vote "yes" on the first and
third steps will be taken for the perma
nent establishment of the "honor sys
tem" and student control: .
" During the meeting Graduate Manager
Decoto reported $188 15 in the student
treasury and $280 50 due from the alumni.'
As $500 is still owing a local bank, this
leaves the students $31 35 in debt should
accounts be balanced. Winfield Dorn of
the student track finance committee re
ported that $709 90 had been collected from
the student body to be put in the track
team fund. This sum represented contri
butions from only 'one-fifth of all the col
legians.
E. W. Decoto was renominated for the
position of graduate manager. . No candi
date was put in opposition, for Decoto
was the unanimous choice of the student
body. ;'.v %
Furlcng is a junior in the college of
chemistry and his home is in this city.
Wright comes from Los Angeles and is a
junior In the college of social science. The
position for which they are both candi
dates is particularly important. The pres
ident is at the head of all student attairs
and has the appointment of leading com
mittees. The election will be held next
Thursday at North Hall.
The candidates are as follows: Presi
dent, H. W. F. Furlong and S. B. Wright;

BERKELEY, April- 4.-The 'Associated
Students of the University of California
nominated officers for the. coming year
this morning at a meeting held in Har
mon Gymnasium. Unusual interest was
manifested in the nominations, particular
ly for the position of president.
BERKELEY, April 4.â Henry yogt, who
lives on Acton street, near Virginia, was
arrested this evening and taken to Â«.~e
County Jail "on a charge of assault to
commit, murder. The complaint .was
sworn to before Justice Edgar by Hugh
O'Neill, a neighbor of Vogt. ,
O'Neill alleges that Vogt shot at him
with a shotgun this afternoon, the charge
tearing up the ground within two feet of
him. He says that his dog chased one of
Vogt's chickens out of the O'Neill yard,
and that Vogt, seeing this, rushed into
his house and reappeared with a gun, and
shouting to O'Neill, "Nfew, I have you
alone," raised it and fired. O'Neill de
clares Vogt shot to kill.
Vogt has been in trouble before. About
a year ago he was found guilty of bat
tery on P. O'Neill, the complaining wit
ness! father. The present difficulty seems
to be the outcome of neighborly friction.
Vogt's bond has been fixed at $3000.
In all other respects Judge Ogden held
that the complaint was grood as against
a general demurrer. He wants things
mere clearly stated, however, in the three
particulars noted- He gave ten days
within which the plaintiff can amend his
complaint.
Thirdâ That the complaint says no proper
tooountirg: has been given, implying that some
oecouctir* had been given, when, as is alleged,
there was none at all. The complaint must
show. too. in what particular this failure to
Eccount was improper.
Second â That the complaint does not anno
tate the owners of the stocks and bonds alleged
to belong to the Enquirer corporation that the
complaint says are in the hands of private in
dividuals wrongfully. Judge Ogden held that
the complaint should state in -whose names this
property stands and how much it is worth.
All the arguments were of a technical
rcture. There were three cardinal points
that helped to undo Mr. Collins* complaint
end they are enumerated as follows:
Firstâ That there is no distinct allegation
in the complaint that the services of G. B.
Daniels as managing editor of the Enq lirer
were not worth $500 a month.
The flaws were all pointed out in a de
murer that Henry P. Dalton's attor
ney filed in his behalf. R. M. Fitzgerald
and Carl Abbott were in- Judge Ogden'8
court to explain the alleged errors, and
J. B. Richardson was present to explain
them away. Henry Ach, Mr. Richard
son's associate, was absent.
After listening to the arguments of the
attorneys all day Judge Ogden decided
to-day that the supplementary complaint
D. Edward Collins filed against Dr.
George C. Pardee, Henry P. Dalton and
G. B. Daniels of the Oakland Enquirer
needs patching in a number of places
where there are legal rents.

When the doctor himself brings on

as follows. His letter Is rather long and
this* extract -is necessarily condensed: .
"I om a physician of IS years' practice.
I felt the need of a Etimulant and for the

strong coffee. Eight or ten years ago I
began to notice symptoms of heart dls-

ganic type and year by year became ag-
gravated. . Dizziness, falntness and later
inability to walk at times.
"Physicians could find no marked symp-
toms of disease, but thought there might
be of a kind that escaped observation.
Finally I became a confirmed invalid and
gave up practice.
"Several y*ars elapsed with the symp-
toms growing worse. I was considered
as marked for an early grave. It finally
became impressed upon me to give up
coffee. This I found easier to do when
Postum Food Coffee was used in its place.

Superintendent Storer started out on his tour
of Inspection. The Express had discharged a
load of gravel. The discharging finished, the
two Johnsons invested in a demijohn of whis
ky and sailed down the bay until they reached
the cable. There they dropped anchor, got a
firm grip of the Pottal Company's big rope and
retired to the cabin to drink up the whisky.
When Storer went alongside yesterday morn
ing his hails were unanswered. He boarded
the schooner, went below and discovered the
Johnsons fast asleep in their respective bunks.
The demijohn was almost empty and on the
cabin table stood two big tumblers, about
half filled with the liquor. Storer aroused the
captain, who rblled on deck and in response to
Storer' e request began to haul up the anchor.
The skipper's wind was poor, however. Two
turns on the windlass exhausted his energy.

SPEEDY BRITISH BARK WHICH HAS ADDED TO HER LAURELS AS A
RECORD BREAKER BY MAKING A REMARKABLY QUICK PASSAGE
FROM THIS PORT TO FALMOUTH, ARRIVING THERE YESTERDAY.
The committee has established permanet
quarters on the tenth floor of the Claua
Spreckels building, and m%ny ass'stants
are now at work on fhe details of the re
ception and care of the thousands of
strangers who are expected to visit the
encampment. It is. expected to be the
greatest in the history of the organiza
tion, and no effort ? will be spared to
maintain the splendid reputation for hos
pitality which San Francisco already en
joys at the East.
The - matter was discussed at some
length, thS result being that the wishes
of the people of San Francisco who will
be asked to contribute to the entertain
ment fund will be respected. \
At the suggestion of the chair R. P.
Hurlbut was appointed chairman of a
committee to take exclusive charge of the
housing-of the 15,000 Knights who are to
come^here. | He was also given charge of
the district bounded by Market and Mc-
Allister streets, from their Intersection at
Jones street to the Pacific Ocean, with a
view of raising money sufficient to defray
the extra expense which will be incurred
if the encampment is to be held in the
Pavilion and the offer of the Government
declined. \
:The announcement was made that the
people of the Mission offered the com
mittee $1000 in cash and a lot free for
the use of Â¦-. the Knights provided the
encampment was held in the Mission. The
Government has. offered the use of the
Presidio, ! together with a sufficient num
ber of wall tents, and considerable pres
sure is being brought to bear upon the
committee to have the encampment lo
cated-there.-.
The executive committee having in
charge the arrangements for the national
encampment of the Uniform Rank,
Knights of Pythias, which is to be held
in this city on August\ll, is making rapid
progress. At a meeting held yesterday in
the office of Charles L.. Patton, j chairman
of the committee, numerous favorable re-
x ports from subsidiary committees and
others interested in the work were re
ceived. .
Those present were Charles- L. Patton,
Charles Bundschu, Jacob Samuels, A. E.
Buckingham, H. Â«L. Judeil and W. C.
Graves. Chairman Patton stated that nu
merous inquiries were being received
-from all quarters relative to the forth
coming encampment and that the general
interest in the affair was widespread. In
his judgment fully 50,00u visitors from the
East would' attend the encampment, not
tp speak of 25,000 more from various parts
of the Pacific Coast.

Nrjv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, April 4.â To-<Jay'Â« stock mar
ket gave unmistakable evidence of a substan
tial recruiting of the speculative element. The
movement was a srood deal of a mystery, both
es to its motive and as to the identity of the
operators. Stock market gossip attributed it
to the same group of Western capitalists to
v.-hich many recent movements have been at
tributed and which haÂ« been supposed to be
concerned In the present large speculative op
erations in the grain markets. The day's op
erations were on a far larger scale than any
thing m the recent history of the stock mar
kÂ»-t. The dealings In St- Paul and Unton Pa
cific were vividly reminiscent of the days of
the boom of last year. If the dealings in these
ftocke tre added to those in Louisville and
Nashville and in Southern Pacific it will bÂ«
found that considerably more than cne-thlrd
ot the day's aggregate transactions .. are ac
counted for. It was not until late in the day,
in fact, that much Impression waÂ» made on
other portions of the list. Such stocks as New
York Central and Pennsylvania were then
brought forward with spasmodic ad\'ances. In
the final hour selling to take profits made
heavy inroads upon prices and reduced all of
the principal gains to fractional limits. Tfce
n:arket closed dull but steady. There was no
nctrs to account for the sudden demand for
stocks, although rumors were plenty pointing
to a fresh readjustment of control in ,the
transcontinental railroad systems. Rather the
movement seemed based upon an assumption
that the time of doubt and uncertainty over the
outcome of the year was practically past, with
tne largest requirements coon the money mar
ket Fupposed to be met. and with the crops
assured of a good condition after the winter
to start the season with. To account for any
such total of sales aÂ« tho?. v recorded in the
principal active ftocks to-day allowance must
be made for the sale end resale many times of
identical holdings. The peneral reaction at the
end of the day also points to the tentative
character of the speculation. There was very
active realfrJng: amenp the. Epecialties recently
advanced, conspicuously Sufrar and Colorado
Fu'l. Neither was thrre lacking the wide
advance 1 in obscure specialties which have re
cently characterised the market. There wa*
n,j change in the situation of the money mar
kÂ«. The firmness of rlrr'Ang exchange and
tne further decline in Paris rate of (sterling
TfMnt to pold exports next week. The local
money market was -lulet. however. -
There was an active demand for bonds, for
wtiich ihei-e was a Â«ood open market all day.

Butter is slightly cheaper again. Eggs and
Cheese are unchanged. - Meats show some
Â¦variation. Veal Is scarce, while Spring Lamb
is comics into market more freely.
Poultry and Game are about as before and
there Is little change to note in Fish.
A" few Strawberries are coming In, but they
are very dear, as will be seen. Changes In
spring Vegetables are few.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS
Failures in the TJnited States this week were
178. against 145 last year, and . 22 . in Canada,
against 29 last year. ' â¢ . ;, .
The .course , of commodity â¢ prices during the
month of March indicated a seasonable ten
dency downward. "'Dun's index number, giving
the aggregate of quotations proportionate to
consumption, was $9!>,222 on April' 1, against
$101,543 a menthk ago. This decline of i 2.3
per cent was mainly due to the higher tem
perature, which accelerated the output of gar
den and dairy products. . - . ' . : â¢ Â¦ Â¦
Widely divergent views as to the crop out
look Yesulted in a dull market for cereals.Vand
only small changes in prices. Wheat receipts
for the week were 2,078,999 bushels, â¢ against
2,375,135 last year, while exports from all
ports of the United States amounted to 3,-oG5,
070 bushels, compared with 4,027,007 bushels
a year ago. â¢ : . ,'. . Â¦ ; Â¦
Labor controversies continue to be the only
seriously disturbing. events in the industrial
world, and while many disagreements have
been promptly settled, others have appeared to
Interrupt production and . make manufacturers
conservative about new undertakings. Retail
distribution of spring wearing apparel received
a check i from the inclement I weather in many
localities,' yet merchandise of most staple lines
is purchased freely and collections are satis
factory at nearly all points, except the Soutn.
Supplies of iron and feteel do not seem in any
immediate danger of overtaxing the demand.

ItEAL ESTATE TBANS ACTIONS.
John Murray, the "wild man" of Tele
graph HI11 ( who gave three police officers
a lively chase when they went to capture
him, was committed to the insane asylum
at Mendocino yesterday by Judge Heb
bard. The old man fought the officers
while en route to the train.
McDonald in his defense claimed that
the "maintenance fund" of the play
ground showed a profit, but that if the
repairs and other expenses embraced un
der the head of "construction account,"
and which he claimed were absolutely
necessary, were considered, then it would
show a loss. One item that was strongly
objected to was the expenditure of nearly
$1000 for the furnishing of the apartments
occupied _by the matron- of the ground. -
After a careful study of all the circum
stances and an expression on the part of
all the Commissioners except McDonald
that the present plan was too costly it
was "decided that it would be to the best
interest of the park to return to the old
condition and lease the playground as a
concession. Definite action -will be taken
at a meeting to be held within the next
two weeks.
Mayor Schmitz was an interested par
ticipant in a special meeting of the Park
Commissioners held yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of considering the Ios3 of
revenue from the children's playground.
When Murphy, the former concessionaire,
lost the privilege, for which he paid $1000
a year, the playground was placed in
charge of Commissioner McDonald. A
number of improvements were made, but
JSOOO more than was received was ex
pended. This, with the loss of the $1000
paid annually by Murphy, represented a
total of J9000.

DEER LODGE, Mont, April 4.â Clinton
Dotson was hanged to-day at ll;20 a. m.
for his participation in the murder of his
father. Dotson went to the scaffold with
out fear or trembling. Just before the
trap was sprung he confessed to the
crime. He slept until within a half hour
before he was led out to the scaffold.
His neck was broken by the fall.
The crime for which Dotson paid the
extreme penalty of the law to-day waa
one unique in criminal annals. Dotson
was serving a life sentence T!or the mur
der of Eugene Cullinane, an old placer
miner of Washington Gulch.. Cuhinane
was said to have secreted in his cabin
vast wealth as the result of his mining
and this Dotson is supposed to have been
after. Cullinane was ambushed and shot
down near his home. Dotson's father, a
neighbor of Cullinane, was one of the
principal witnesses against him at the
Jaines McArthur was Dotson's cellmate
in the penitentiary, and with Â«Um Dotson
plotted the crime for which he died. Mc-
Arthur was serving a short term, and
upon his release from prison was to pro
ceed -to Washington Gulch, assassinate
Dotson's father and pin on the body a
confession declaring that the elder Dot
son had murdered CuUinane and that the
son was innocent of the crime. This con
fession it was expected would free Dot
son.
Dotson promised McArthur half of $15,
000 which he claimed he had buried in
Wyoming after he had killed the old man.
' A convict in the penitentiary, in the cell
adjoining the conspirators, overheard the
plot, but did not inform, the authorities
until after the commission of the crime.
McArthur was hanged for this crime
September 6, 1901.
Dotson recently in a sensational appeal
to the Governor for clemency declared
that a plot existed in the penitentiary
whereby Warden Conley was to be killed
by McArthur in a plan for a general es
cape o* the prisoners.
Dotson declared McArthur alone was re
sponsible for the murder of both his
father and Culllnane. Dotson also claimed
McArthur confessed to him the killing of
a man whose remains were found near
Central Park in 1900. Dotson gave hi3
name as Allen and said his folks lived in
Walla Walla.

As a preface to Mr. Smith's talk, an
entertaining programme^of musical selec
tions was rendered. It included the fol
lowing numbers:
Mr. Smith touched the chords of pity
in his hearers' breasts when he described
the sufferings and privations that were
endured by the gallant boys who wore
the blue. In closing he paid a beautiful
tribute to the noble women of the North,
to whose unceasing labors, he said, waa
due in a srreat measure the suppression of
the rebellion. "England," he declared, "has
produced one Florence Nightingale, whila
the United .States has given birth to a
hundred thousand."
Frank W. Smith of Ohio gave a delight
ful talk on "In and Out of Andersonville"
before the members of the California So
ciety and their friend3 last night In Bal
boa Hall, . Native , Sons' building. The
speaker proved himself .a master of wit
and pathos and gave a very interesting
description of some of the thrilling events
of the Civil War. Andersonville, he said,
was the largest of the seventeen prisons
used by the Confederates. lie said it was
surrounded by three stpekades, the first
twenty feet in height, the second sixteen
feet and the last twelve feet, and the
whole surrounded by a ditch nine feet in
width. The famous prison was spread
over twenty- three acres of ground, and
the speaker stated that when he was im
prisoned in it there were 33,405 Union
men, more than~ thirty-three full regi
ments of 1000 men each, conflneer within
its narrow limits.

On.LJng Sing, alias. On Sing, who la
wanted in Los Angeles for murder, was
arrested in the Hall of Justice yesterday
morning by Detectives Ed Gibson and
McMahon- and Policeman . E. J. McNa
mara. It became known, "Wednesday night
that he was in this city and several Chi
nese searched for him to hand him over
to the police, as a reward of $150 had been
offered for his- capture. -
yesterday morning he called at the bond
and warrant clerk's office and asked for
a warrant for the arrest of a Chinese
highbinder, who had threatened to shoot
him, and he wanted to be protected. The
warrant was refused, and as he stepped
cut into the . corridor the officers placed
him under arrest and took him upstairs
to the City Prison. Captain Seymour had
a talk with him and he admitted that he
was the man wanted. â¢-'
He brutally murdered "Wong Ung Wong,
his assistant as cook at the Simmons
brick yards, Los Angeles, about 1 o'clock
in the morning of February 25 last, nearly
chopping Â¦ his victim to - pieces with a
hatchet. Â¦
When questioned by Captain Seymour
On Ling King said that his assistant owed
him money and would not pay him. They
had some words about it -that night, and
while he . was asleep In his bunk Wong
Ong Wong came at him with a butcher
knife. Wong made a lunge at his head.
He was wakened by the noise Wong made
,and dodged the blow. He jumped out of
his bunk, seized the hatchet and killed
Wong. . â¢
Chief Charles Elton of Los Angeles was
notified by Captain Seymour of thÂ© arrest
and received a reply that an officer would
be sent at once to take him. back.'

Soard . of Works Takes Preliminary
Action Toward Bituminizing

The Board of Works decided yesterday
to recommend to the Board of Super
visors the conditional acceptance of Mis
sion street, between Silver and Onon
daga avenues, Commissioner . Casey
voted against this acceptance, and pro
posed in lieu thereof a resolution accept
ing Mission street , from Crescent avenue
to the county line, which was defeated.
A. B. Maguire and other representa
tives of the Mission Street Improvement
Club urged the acceptance of the street,
which will make. possible the work of-re
paving the street with bitumen. The city
appropriated $15,000 for the purpose and
the property owners subscribed $7500.
The secretary was directed to advertise
for proposals for repavlng Van Ness ave

Chinese |j rioters attempted to murder
Doorkeeper John MeAuliff at ; the Wash
ington-street Theater last night: The dis
turbers were highbinders who have been
recently deprived of passes to the enter
tainments and who are .deemed by the
police to be the most dangerous charac
ters in Chinatown.
The trouble grew out of an assault made
upon Ah Sin, a highbinder, early in the
evening. : While partly intoxicated, Sin
tried to force .his entrance into, the play
house, in company with a number of - his
ilk, and was severely beaten by the door
keeper. He was sent to the City Emer
gency Hospital, and while there a rumor
was circulated that he had died. The
highbinder tongs. to whi.ch Sin belongs re
solved on vengeance, and had it not been
for :, the . timely . appearance - of Officers
liandley and Hamgan and the memoers
of -Sergeant Conboy's squad, they would
probably have accomplished their mur
uerous purpose.
After Sin had been taken away in the
police patrol wagon from the Central sta
tion and the rumor;, of his death had
spread, a mob of angry Mongolians con
gregated about the theater. , The infuri
ated heathens, after- several -moments of
heated conversation, started to rush up
the ttairs, many of them armed with clubs
and other weapons. When the crowd first
gathered, .word was sent to the 'police,
and Otncer3 Handley and Harrigan rushed
to the scene. After a hard struggle, in
which/they were obliged to use their
clubs without stint, the officers succeeded
in driving the rioters down the stairs
again, : ; . . . r
The Mongolians, - smarting under ~ the
rebuke at the hands of the police, pre
pared to make a second attack. They
marshaled their forces together and again
startedup the stairs, s) The two policemen
took a stand in front of the doorkeeper
and prepared to defend his life. At this
juncture several other officers* arrived,
and, arter another desperate battle, drove
the crowd away. . . . ' .
Ah Sin, the cause df the 'difficulty, after
he had been treated at the hospital, was
taken to the Hall of Justice and locked
up on a charge of drunkenness.
First â Experienced teachers who have shown
themselves unusually efHcient and who have
not taueht more than twenty years. These
shall constitute four-tenths of the eligible list.
Second â Unusually promising rraduates of
training 6chools. These shall constitute three
tentl;8 cf the eligible list
The board of 1900, presided over by
Director Mark, made a loud flourish of its
adoption of a plan of civil service exam
inations In the appointment of all new
teachers. The plan was outlined and un
der the "Kincaid" board of last year res
olutions were adopted on August 15 last
which were as follows:
The eligible list shall be composed cf not
more than fifty persons, selected as follows : .
The teachers who were elected on De
cember 28, 1S98, did not join in the litiga
tion, but it follows that If other elections
of the year from August 1 were illegal
those made on- almost the last day of the
year were also void, as the teachers had
no chance to serve on probation, as their
appointments were rescinded by a new
board a week later.
Elections Are Void.
A number of these ladies have been re
instated in the school department since
their dismissal and the present board has
placed Miss Moran and Miss Cohen on the
eligible list.
The teachers who were elected regular
teachers In 1838 at meetings of the board
that did not include the meeting of De
cember 28 made a test case in the courts
of the proceedings by which they had
been deprived of their positions. In the
case of Mrs. C. Arguello the Supreme
Court decided that as she had not com
plied with- the rules of the board and
served six months as a regular teacher
on probation she had no right to demand
reinstatement.
Among the teachers elected oh Decem
ber Â£8, 1898, included In the resolution of
dismissal of January 25, 1899, were Mrs.
Sjjencer, Miss M. Coyle. Mrs. M. Meil,
Miss M. F. Dowling, Mrs. H. B. Steele,
Miss K. McGuire, Miss Rae Cohen, Miss
D. F. Moran and Mrs. J. Cashman.

Dcwling, Spanish; Miss L>. Maban, Span
ish; Miss Rae Cohen, stenography; Miss
A. Bodkin, typewriting; Mrs. H. B. Steels,
stereoptieon, and Miss K. Gorham, book
keeping.
The resolution passed on December 2S,
1S8S, elected the following special teach
ers as resrular teachers:
On January 25 the board passed an
omnibus resolution by which more than
100 teachers were dismissed from the de
partment. The resolution was as follows:
"All teachers who have not been regu
larly elected as such, including both sub
stitute and probationary teachers, ap
pointed since August 1, 1S98, are hereby
dismissed from the department."
On January 4 the beard adopted a res
olution rescinding the resolution passed
by the previous board of December 28,
by which a number of special teachers
had been elected as regular teachers.
On January 1, 1SS9, the board known as
the "Bergerot" board came into, existence
and proceeded to make a clean sweep of
the school department.
Makes Clean. Sweep.
There are many rumors being spread
around that the days of "politics and pull
in the school department" are not things
of the past, and that the reinstatement of
certain teachers savors of a "job."
The records of the Board of Education,
however, speak for themselves in far
etrongcr tones than mere rumors and gos
sip, and an examination of the minutes of
the present board and its predecessors
discloses a peculiar state of affairs.
In the last half of the year 189S the
Board of Education elected a large num
ber of special and substitute teachers as
regular teachers. The meetings of the
board were continued up to the last day
of the year, when the terms of the direc
tors expired.
School Directors Mark. Woodward and
Koncovieri voted to reinstate Miss Mo
ran and Miss Cohen on the rolls of the de
partment, while Director Denman took
the attitude that the ladles should be
treated as new applicants and compelled
to take their chances in competitive ex
aminations. ~-:CSl~ 'Â¦
IT "WILL be welcome news to more
than a hundred school teachers who
lost their positions in January, ISM,
to learn that the Board of Education
has established a precedent by which
they may be reinstated in the department.
According to the recent action of the
board in placing the names oi Miss Dor
othy F. Moran and Miss Rae Cohen on
the* eligible list the Board of Education
cannot refuse to reinstate all of the
teachers who were dismissed from the de
partment, and will not demand that they
go through the dull routine of a competi
tive examination, or In any way comply
with the so-called civil service rules of
the education body.
