.Payno Makes Point of Order. *
JThe- Republican leaders hurriedly consulted
during the reading of the resolution and when
the' reading- had been concluded Payne,' the ma
jority leader, immediately made the point or
order that the matter . presented was not priv
ileged. .TiU .basis of, the resolution, Payne'
said contemptuously,- was based upon an alleged
secret' report 1 to the Danish Government. -
Richardson met this with the statement that
he had a copy of the secret report to the Dan
ish Government. '. ' * Â¦
"On my honor, as a member of this House,"
eald he,'* '.'I '.'have .'now. In my desk what pur

"When did the gentleman obtain access to
the secret archires of the Danish Government?*.'.
Interposed _ Payne, : sarcastically.'
''I ' never â¢ have , been - in Â» Denmark," '. retorted
â¢Richardson of Tennessee, the minority
leader.offcred as a matter of privilege a
resolution for the appointment of a com
mittee of five to investigate" the charges
said to have been made by Walter Christ
mas, a semi-official representative of the.
'Government . of Denmark, in ; a secret re
port' to his Government, In which It was .
made to appear that he was to" receive
$500,000 of the purchase money, for. the sale ;
of the Danish West Indies for bribing ''Â¦

The resolutions j presented by Richard

' "Whereas, one Walter Christmas, a

w Sj| f âA genuine sensation
k/k/- '. tras â¢.-caused- in the
tjr B' House . to-day _vby the
* * presentation by Rich-
ardson of Tennessee,
the Democratic leader, "of charges alleg
ing the corrupt use of a fund of $500.00J
in connection with the sale of the Danish-
West Indies. The charges were contained
in an alleged secret report of Captain
"Walter Christmas to the Danish Govern
ment, which declared that he had em
rloyed corrupt means .to bring the nego
tiations for the eale of the Islands' to a
consummation. The report,' extracts from
which Richarflscn read, mentioned .the
names of Abner McKinley and his part
ner. Colonel Brown; C. W. Knox, who
v/as described as "an intimate friend' of
Senator Manna;" Richard P. Evans, who
was said to represent "Mr. Gardner and
his friends In the House," and two^press
associations, the names of which. -were not
given, as having been Interested in the
matter.
The charges against members of Con
.gress were not specific. Upon the basis of
this report, Richardson asked the adop
tion of a resolution for the appointment
cf an investigating committee of seven.
The Speaker ruled", that the matter was
privileged after Richardson had amended
hlr resolution, bo as to specifically Include
members cf the House. Great excitement
attended the whole proceeding.
Cannon of Illinois insisted that Richard
eon's presentation -was fragmentary and
that the whole matter should go over
until to-morrow In order that members
nJght read the documents presented,
â¢which included newspaper extracts, affi
davits, etc., in the record. Christmas, no
declared, on his own statement was a
briber or worse. But the House voted
dswn the motion to postpone and the res
cltrtion. after being amended In minor
particulars, was adopted. The Speaker
immediately appointed the following com
mittee to make the investigation:
Paizeli (R.) of Pennsylvania, Hitt (R.)
cf Illinois, Cousins (R.) of Iowa, McCall
<R.) of Massachusetts. Richardson (D.)
cf Tennessee. Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas,
and Cowherd (D.) of Missouri.
EVERAL stories are in circu
-. fl^/- / ' latlon regarding the Influences
.^^^^ which prevailed on Governor
. Gage in the recent appolnt
,^^ i * ' ment of a "Superior Judge in
San Joaquin County. The
facts seem to be that the Governor studied
the political situation with an effort to
ascertain what effect the appointment
would have on his own prospects in San
Joaquin County. Perhaps the Governor
appointed the best man on the list of as
pirants. Information received by The Call,
however, is -to. the effect that Gage ap
pointed the candidate who wa3 most ac
ceptable to the law department of tho
Southern Pacific. The following story
from Sacramento concerning the appoint
ment Is readable: â¢ "
SACRAMENTO,' March 27.â The Bee to
night publishes a very amusing tale from
Stockton of a gold brick presented to and
accepted by. Governor Henry T.Gage. A
short while ago Judge Joseph Budd, one
of the Judges of the Superior Court of
San Joaquin County, died. In Stockton,
and Governor Gage has been meditating
for some time as to who he would appoint
to tha vacancy, having, of course* due
consideration to the Improvement and re
pair of his own political fences.
"Wednesday afternoon Alexander Brown,
chairman of . the State Board of Equali
zation, meandered into Stockton, evi
dently, at the request of Governor Gage,
to inquire Into matters over there con
cerning the various aspirants . for the
judgeship.
TELEPHONES HIS VXEWS.
Wednesday, night he telephoned from
the Stockton Independent office his views
on the matter, and the Governor tele
phoned over, the appointment of George
P. Buck to be Superior Judge In place of
the lately deceased Judge Joseph Budd.
; Now comes the story as wafted from
Stockton. It appears that George F.
Buck is In hot water with the Federated
Trades of Stockton, an organization to
which Governor Gage has been kowtow-
Ing for quite a long. while. In fact George
F. Buck is virtually on, the blacklist of
the Federated Trades of Stockton because
he has persisted 'in. patronizing an estab
lishment which that organization hail
boycotted.
The attorney for.the Federated Trades,
one.C. II. Falrall, was an aspirant for
this .position, and it is asserted that the
cither, day Governor Gage told Fairall that
he would give him a hearing in referancÂ©

CALL. BUREAU,, 1106 G STREET, , N.
W., WASHINGTON. March- 27.â Secretary
Root is preparing nn onslaught on Lieu
tenant General Miles which will make
tha,t officer's reprimand in connection
with the Schley case I appear" in compari
son in the light of a mild rebuke -
The exact object of Secretary Root in
formulating this statement cannot be as
certained, and, In fact, those close to him
disposed to deny that he contemplates
making any public criticism of thiV com
manding general.' X A
Nevertheless a member of the Cabinet
said this afternoon . that since . General
Miles' attack on the President and Secre
tary Root.. the latter has been collecting
information bearing upon the ' relations
which General Miles sustained with La
mont when that* gentleman was Secretary
of War, with General, Alger and himself.
A report was current in army, circles that
the Secretary was preparing this state
ment for the use of the President in con
nection with the transmission to Congress
of the Information called for by,the"Bur
leson resolution. .' i'yi'-i â¢ .
PURPOSE OP ROOT.
..This resolution, however,/ calls,, upon;
the President only .for' "Copies of all cor
recpondence relating to : and papers : bear
ing upon the matter of the. recent request
/>f_I J ieu^enant^General ll Milea4yB;.!bBi.as
fcigned; to ;dut"y In aBe'phiirppInvo .; and! to
be allo wed' v to I put" into - effect 'there the
plan, c utlined by him having ; for its pur
pose arid being: calculated to .bring about
an Immtd:ato . cessation of . hostilities! in
snid Philippines without further loss 'â¢ of
life on either side.".
It would seem to be impolitic for the
President to use this resolution as. a peg
upon which to hang a statement of Lieu
tenant General- Mills', general conduct,
and it is i;ot believed that this is the pur
pose wl.ich the Secretary has in view in
preparing a statement' of that officer's
services since/his occupancy. of his pres
ent pcriUoii'. ' </ t;'': : - ~?"^\
There is nc intention at present of plac
ing lieutenant General Miles on the re
tired list, although the statement wouM
be useful in showing the causes which
would prompt the President to take su;h
action. Secretary Root has not, however,
finished his testimony before the Senate
Military Committee, and lie will reply to
the strictures passed upon the President
and himself by / General Miles. It may
be that he will, avail 1 himself of this op
porl unity to speak his mind about the
commanding General.
"MILES REMAINS SERENE.
When the statement reaches the public
it v.'il. be found tc be in the nature of a
resume of the correspondence to which
General Miles was a party. There was
fricMon between General Miles and La
morit, an open iupture between General
Algcr and the commanding general, arid
the same condition exists to-day between
that army officer and his superior. It will
bo shown that General Miles alone was
responsible' for bringing this condition
about. It was the duty of General Miles
to bave : supported tlie views of the Presi
dent and Secretary, of War on the canteen
question,'*' yet he â¢deliberately approved ' the
abolition of this soldiers' comfort. Gen
eral Miles has, also been blamed for. per
mitting the statement to reach the public
that he had opposed the location of forts
near large cities because he did not think
H proper or â¢ wise to attempt to overawe
the laboring man. Enemies of the general
say in the case ofkhe canteen he sought
the influence ' of the temperance people of
the ccuntry, and in the other the support
of the labor classes. " rcM ic,tC<'ri
General Miles Is apparently serene under
the sword '6f -Damocles which is 'hanging
over'hia head.', He was at- the' "War De
partment this' morning, and attended to
routine matters.- and this afternoon -was
playing golf at the v Country Club.. .His
friends insist- that he_ is noi ; dissatisfied
with the :result of his frank statement
to the Senate Â¦Committee", as the staff re
organization bill is dead, and this was the
object of his criticism. _

will wonder why Herrin. instead of the

that the time is auspicious for political

When, early In February last, the contents of
Walter Christmas' secret report to the Dani6h
Government relative to the transfer .of .the
Danish- West Indies to the United States be
came public a party comprising a large portion
of Denmark's best and most influential men
and highest Interests, realizing -that since
Christmas had in the furtherance of the pend
ing treaty served by direct authority, flrtt.
the Secretary of State of the United States,
and afterward the Danish Prime Minister/ Mr.
Horring. It would be impossible tb disassociate
his efforts from the treaty or the- methods set
forth in .' his report from the official negotia
tions; and, realizing further that If the pres
ent treaty was consummated and -permitted; to
take effect, Denmark would be obliged to stand
before the world as having made use of and
the United States as having accepted such ne
gotiations as said Christmas sets forth and
describes in the above-mentioned report, and

of every capital of Europe. These charges
have gone forth to the world that there is a

"Xow. I am not' here to charge, ' and I do'

Richardson then proceeded:

Speaker, delivering his ruling. - "Exactly what

extracts from the press at Copenhagen. These
were followed by an affidavit from Neils Grcn
concerning his .dealings with certain people

The real sensation came when he started to
read from what purported to fee the report of
Walter Christmas concerning the negotiations.
He prefaced the reading by the statement that
it would show a "corrupt bargain" worthy of
the consideration of the House. The report was
too long to read in full, he eatd.

cago, who has created more suc

ple than any other man in his
line, who has made millionaires
by the magic of printer's ink and brains,
is at the Palace. Hotel with his wife. Mr.
Fuller, "is a man .of striking personal ap
pearance; .fully six feet tall, straight as
a ; ; redwood,, broad-shouldered, wellknlt
frame, in the prime of : life, a startling
resemblance to ' Colonel William Cody
(Buffalo Bill), with his iron gray mus
tache and beard, a keen eye and a pleas
ant face. . ...
He commands .. . one of the strongest
forces' and allies of modern successful
commercialism, he diffuses knowledge of
good things that makes toward peaceful
victories in business; in short, he is a
master of the a^t'and science of adver
tising. Advertising is his profession, and
his history is the history of advertising
in the United States. He. visits Califor
nia for the first time and is delighted with
the State. His high opinion of our State
has more merit and force because Mr.
Fuller is a widely traveled. man, not only
in this country, but abroad.
Mr. Fuller, is ;.a JPennsylvanian, with
Connecticut ancestry.: He moved to - Illi
nois ' when a' boy and came ; to. Chicago
early: in 1871.' ' ' ' ,
The resolutions were then perfected by the
Insertion of "it Is alleged" before all assertions
of fact. ' At the suggestion of Lacey of Iowa
the reference In the resolution to newspapers
was changed to 'read "newspapers or press as
sociations."' ' .- -. . â¢.; Â¦-.
With these changes the resolutions were put
to a vote and were carried without a dissenting
vote. The Speaker .immediately announced the
investigating committee.
But Cannon angrily objected, his objection
being sustained by half a dozen other Repub
licans. The Speaker then put the question on
Cannon's motion to- postpone; The Republicans
generally voted for the motion, but such a
stentorian chorus of noes came from 'the Demo
cratic side that the Speaker announced: "The
noes seem to have It." . .-
Cannon did not ask for a division and the
Speaker declared the motion lost.
"I do not," insisted RIchardsdn. "That is
exactly what I desire. I ask your consent now
that this report be read In full from the clerk's
desk" '
"I am not seeking to dishonor .any one. I am
seeking to prevent dishonor," -'replied Richard
son. â¢ ;: Â¦ - . , <i\ -
"The gentleman fears to have the House ex
amine the documents before Unvotes," retorted
Cannon. .
"But these charges are printed in Denmark
and were known here from January 28 to Feb
ruary 17," Interposed Richardson.
"Does the gentleman not, think the Secretary
of State should have called the attention of the
Senate to the charge that $500,000 was being
epent to bring about a successful termination
of the negotiations?"
' "I do not know anything about it," respond
ed Cannon warmly; "and until, I do I. will say
nothing that would: dishonor any one. I'de
mand a vote." .-,-, : . ' Â¦
"But he was accredited by the Secretary of
State," interposed Â¦ Bichafdson, "and Instructed
to go to our Minister In London." -
"The gentleman artfully says the Secretary
of State made this man his agent," cried Can
non, indignantly. "I know nothing about it.
If anything ought to be Investigated I am for
an Investigation. But I am not in favor of
proceeding upon the extracts the gentleman has
read. Let the documents be printed In full.
Then each member of the House can act intel
ligently. No one will be more swift than I to
Investigate charges affecting Federal officials
and members of the American Congress."
Underwood of Alabama then got the floor.'
He declared that the honor of the country was
at stake In this matter and that was far above
the honor of a mere individual. He insisted
that Christmas after coming here to negotiate
the sale of the Islands had gone back as the
accredited agent of -the United States. It mat
tered not. he said.' whether he was thief or
knave he' had made the charges. While he,
hoped, for the honor; of the country, that they
were not true, they : should be thoroughly In-,
vesti'gated.
In answer to an Interrogatory from HItt of
Illinois Richardson stated Christmas' report
was dated October 1, 1901.
Cannon declared that he had never heard of
this man Christmas and he had no knowledge
concerning him, but according to his own belief
he was a briber and worse. Â¦
Honor of Country at Stake.
"I move to postpone the consideration of the
resolution until to-morrow, " : . Interposed .Can-
Thereupon Meier of Indiana protested that
to-morrow was pension day and asked that
Cannon modify his motion to make it Saturday.
"Is not the honor of. a member of the House
more Important than the consideration of a
few pension bills?" cried Pierce of Tennessee.:
'"It seems to me," 'said Cannon. " breaking
In.- ''that It would be-, wise to make this in
vestigation/ if it Is worthy of investigation,
after Â¦ the 'members of the House â¢ have had
opportunity to examine the documents which
the gentleman from. Tennessee has read. They
are to be printed In- the record. When they
are printed we can see what substance there
is in them. There Is no man on the floor of
the House who docs not demand a full inves
tigation ' if the honor of any member is 'au
thoritatively called into question. But 5 1 do
not believe that there is. a man in the House
who wants to investigate the mere statement
of an acknowledged thief. I would be glad if
the whole matter would go over until to-mor
row when members can have had an opportu
nity to examine the documents. I make this
suggestion In the greatest good faith."
"And I have offered the resolution In the
greatest good faith." observed Richardson.
1 "The gentleman asks action on a document
the extracts of which, have. been. read," retorted
Cannon, hotly.
â¢..â¢The gentleman, need/ not become excited or
agitated. I am perfectly willing, to -have- .the

Richardson. â¢' '
Richardson thereupon changed the preamble
so as to read: "Whereas. It is alleged," etc.
Cannon of Illinois made the first rejoinder
of any length. So far as he could catch the
charges, as they were read, he said It ap
peared that pome man named Christmas, who
acknowledged himself a "briber and worse."

an lnvestigatton whether any member of the
House of Representatives were guilty of bri
bery or the acceptance of bribes.
Cannon pressed Richardson to know whether
the report gave the name of a member or
members of the House said to have been
bribed, and they engaged in a very sharp clash.
Cannon was plainly laboring under considerable
excitement.
Richardson Insisted that the report did not
charge members of the House and Senate.

ST. PAUL, March 27.â For the second
time within two weeks the main line of
the Northern Pacific is blocked and pas
senger' traffic is seriously Â¦ interrupted.
Ten days ago the North Dakota section
of the line was tied up by the worst
storm in fifteen years. Reports to-day,
show that trains are blocked by l spring
rains and floods over miles of prairies.
The sudden change in temperature melted
the snow; then came very severe rains,
which hav6 transformed stretches of prai
rie near Mandan, N. D., and between
Mandan and Jamestown into veritable
lakes. . At' -many points the main line
tracks are completely . covered by the
water. Farther north the Great Northern
line has suffered severely, although the
floods have not bt-en' severe enough to
block trains. Still farther north the ' - 8oo'
line has had trouble, although being in
a more broken country It has been less
affected.- Trains -on both .lines are de
layed.. The Northern .Pacific overland
from the West due here Wednesday
afternoon has not yet arrived. The over
land due this afternoon is also blocked
and reports to officials to-night indicate
that the blockade may not be- lifted to
morrow. â¢ ; At midnight a train made up
at Jamestown ; reached St. Paul, bringing
in travelers from points this side of the
flooded,- country. Some of' the Northern
Pacific westbound trains have been trans
ferred to the Great Northern at Fargo
and will go to the coast over that route.
Reports from .Winnipeg say that the
Great Northern's Manitoba division is.
tied up by washouts, but that transcon-:

that at the very time Gage* gave that
promise he had already promised Buck
that he would appoint him. It is further
more publicly asserted by Ex-Judge Ansel
Smith that Governor Gage personally told
him that he -would appoint.. him.
Now comes the funny part of. the neu
ter, provided the Governor finds anything

The statement goes In Stockton that they

SUSPICIOUS CONFERENCE ARRANGED
This proposition is understood to be
strongly urged by Archbishop Ireland and
Archbishop O'Gorman, who would pos
sibly, in the event of its adoption, accom
pany the. first representative of the
United . States Government to visit the
Vatican in an official capacity.
Tt is expected that the administration
will decide as between these conflicting
propositions before the departure from
Washington of Archbishop Sbarretti.
Mgr.- Sbarretti later called on the Presi
dent. He stated that he had simply called
to pay hi3 respects.
But another proposition is under con
sideration at the White House and that
is to -have. the proceedings conducted at
the Vatican by the religious superiors of
Archbishop Soarretti on -the one hand
and by a legal representative of the
United States Government on the other.
In such case it has been suggested that
Governor Taft might stop at Rome on his
return by the eastward route to the Phil
ippines.

â It appears that the issue now presented
to the Government here is one ot extreme

it resolves itself into the question wheth

land problem 'shall " be effected In Manila
or whether it shall be adjusted at Rome.
Archbishop Sbarretti, becoming Arch
bishop of Manila, will be the nominal
owner of al! the lands and real property
belonging to. the friars in the Philippines.
Therefore-he will be the person to whom
application -in- such case would be made
by the Philippine Commission, and the
transfer of - properties would be accom

means common to. condemnatory proceed

Swamp-Root in all such cases, with a feeling of assurance that my patients will .

Gentlemen â I have prescribed that wonderful remedy for kidney complaint. Dr..
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, with most beneficial effect, and know of many cures by Its'
use. These patients had kidney trouble, as diagnosed by other physicians, and
treated without benefit. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root effected a cure. I am a liberal
man and accept a specific wherever I find it, in an'accepted school or out of it.
For desperate cases of kidney complaint under treatment with unsatisfactory re-
Eults I turn to Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,' with most flattering results. I- shall
continue to prescribe it, and from personal observations state that Swamp-Root;
has great curative properties. Truly Yours, .-. . -

as soon as it. is brought ashore and haul
it from the beach to. the yards of the cor

Four men were engaged yesterday on the
wreck, while six men were employed at
the shore end of the apparatus. The men
on the vessel would attach rbpes. to a
number of planks and timbers, the signal
would be given and the engine would haul
tbe lumber from the deck of the ship into
the air, drop it In the water and quickly
pull it ashore.
J. Reach, the diver, who Is in charge of
the work of salvage, stated that about
1500 feet of lumber are hauled ashore by
the "traveler" every, hour. He expects to
finish the job of unloading the cargo in
the course of two .weeks. ' â¢ '
men started operations. The first 'thing
done'was to erect a pair of. "shears" on
the beach. Then a strong wire rope was
lastened to a mast of the wrecked schoon
er and stretched taut over the top of the
â¢â¢shears." . Ropes and tackle blocKs were
attached to the wire guy rope, forming
what Is known as a "traveler.'.' > A sta
tionary steam engine was then put in po
sition in the rear of the "shears" and
used to haul tho "traveler" to and from
the wreck to the shore.

bhow the necessity of erecting a full consulate
at any point. The commercial' and political
conditions In the island of Cuba-, while under

xi-lth this country under the influence of the
new relations which have been created by th?
achievement of Cuban independence and which
are to be broadened and strengthened in every

purpose of this Inquiry vvas to learn, for

the termination of the military occupation of

It is necessary and appropriate that the es

Tcm Pharkey. Jn the greatest pugilistic en-
counter that has ever taken place, both pur-
eued much the came courss of trainiiur. and
tbe firtt and most important part of this train- "
ing was to set the stomach In condition and to
I keep the iiiceÂ«tion absolutely perfect, so that
ever}* rr.uscle and nerve would be at its, high-
est capabilities. . -*VVi; .'
This was not done by a secret patent medi-
cine, but bot'i of these creat pugilists used a
well-known natural digestive- tablet sold by
dnijrGiftB under name of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets and composed of the digestive fer-
laents which every etomacli requires for
healthy direstion.
Champion Jeffries says: "Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets prevent acidity, strengthen the stomach
and insure perfect digestion. They keep a man
in fine t>bysics.l condition." Bisned, James J.
Jeffries, champion of the world.
The rallant lighter, fc'harkey, says: "Stuart' 8
D} tpeptia Tablets remove all discomfort after
eating. They rest the stomach and restore it
to a healthful condition. I heartily recommend
them." Signed. Thos. J. Eharkey.
The advantage of the daily use of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets Is that they keep people
well and Â¦ward off sickness and are equally
valuable to well persons as to the dyspeptics.
Another advantace is that these tablets con-
tain no cathartics or poisons of any character,
but elmply directive ferments which are found
Â» In every healthy stomach, and when digestion
Is Imperfect It is because the stomach lacks
eomÂ« of these elements and Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets supply It.
They arÂ» no cheap cathartic, but & perfectly
eafe end efficient digestive and the demand for
them Is greater than the sale of all other so-
called <3ysDÂ«)Ela cures combined. No remedy
could possibly reach euch a place in public es-
teem except as a. result of positive merit.
Full sized packages are sold by all druggists
ct 50 cents, and the best habit you can possibly

Mrs. John Isele, who lives over the Jlc-
Intyres, heard the old man's cries and
throwing open the window she
called for help and then rushed down
stairs to the assistance of Mclntyre.
Her cries probably frightened off the
burglars from carrying Into effect their
plans to steal the old man's money,
which he had hidden in the house. They
left Mclntyre. bleeding and insensible on
the floor and ran Into the back yard.
Scaling an outhouse and a' fence, they
succeeded in reaching Kate street. Mrs.
Isele saw the fiends jumping over the
back fence, and she took particular pains
to notice their general description. So
excited were the thugs that the man who
carried the revolver ran down the street
with the blood-covered weapon in his
hand. . .

Rt his room shortly before 6 o'clock and
at that time the man seemed perfectly
rational. After dinner Hoglund walked
out of his room armed with a pistol and
deliberately aimed it at Waud. The ball
entered the young man's mouth, lodging
in the jaw. After taking a shot at Waud's
companion, Hoglund â¢ turned the revolver
on himself, the ball entering the right
temple, killing him.

- .Special Disriatch to The Can.
The New Zealander has never yet
acknowledged the receipt of the telegram
sent two days ago by the Century Club
accepting his terms. Good'-.care" will be
exercised to see that he gets the raised
bid of to-day. â¢ **.*
"This !s a matter of business with me.
I want to make all out of this contest
that 1 possibly can. and I guess Fitsslm
mons feels the same way. I believe thnt
it would be right to give all a chance."
There is no doubt that the Century Club
will .'come back with a better proposal
than that from Charleston. The ofter is
expected to be In hand by noon, and then
Fitzsimmons will be notified by the club.
LOS .ANGELES. March 27.â The fact
that the Cornlshman has seen, fit to ac
cept an offer from a club which was not
represented in the bidding ' which was
supposed to close on March 15, and to ac
cept without even consulting .the cham
pion, has .proved . sufficient to, reopen the
whole question in Los Angeles.'
The upshot o'f it all is that to-day Tom
McCarey and Al Levy of the Century
Club will go oui among the business men
of- the city and will make provision to
raise the offer of the South Carolina Club.
They have no doubt of their ability to
do this. One of the things which they
will ask is that the business men of Lbs
Angeles will agree to close their place9 ct
business on the afternoon of the oonte3t
in order that all who may desire to see
the contest will be able to do so. Jim
Jeffries was considerably surprised at the
receipt of the dispatch. He said:
"Up to to-night the best cash offer that
was in sight was that of the Century
Club. From a percentage proposition, I
think that it is still the best offer, for. to
my mind, Los Angeles during the fiesta
week is a belter, gate money proposition
than i3 Charleston at any time.
"Two days ago' Fitzsimmons wanted to
wait until April 1 before deciding any
thing. The Charleston Club was not in
the hunt at all when the bids were origi
nally opened, and if this bid is to be con
sidered it would only appear fair to all
cencerned to give the San Francisco anÂ«i
the Los Angeles clubs a chance to be
heard. I have not replied to 'the telegram
from Fitzsimmons yet. for, you see, he
wanted time. _I shall probably reply to
morrow.

he had run two lines down the eastern

In aline across the dÂ«sert, The engineer
writes that tho Ban Diego people who arc
promoting the proposition may figure as
follows:
. From Ban Diego eastward for the first
thirty miles the gradient will be 1 ner
cent, or 62.8 feet to the mile; from the
thirtieth mile to the one hundred and
twentieth mile the gradient will be 1.4 per
cent; or 74 feet to the mllo, and from the
one hundred and twentieth mile to the
Colorado River the gradient will be less
than 40 feet to the mile.
This means that the San Diego Eastern

across the divide that has been found,
and considerably lower than any road
now entering California. There will be
no grade on the line where a "pusher

We held a conference with presidents of tho
coal-carrying rullroruls and conciliation com'
mlttee of the National Civic Federation to-day.'
After dliicUEslng the fltuatlon the CIVlo Fed
ptatlon requested postponement of action for
ft period not to exceed thirty day*, within
v/hlch tlmÂ« the operator* agree to meet ua In
conference with tha Clvlo Federation for the
purpoM of trying to reconcile tho difference*
between uÂ«. In tho meantime mine* Â«rÂ« to

ful that the ciiKstlotn at luitue will bo nulls
fnctorily ndjUMlt-d and n etrlko avoided. Notify
nil mine worker* to defer action upon resolu
tion* adopted at HUtttunkitt convention.
Neither Mitchell nor any of the coal
operators would discuss the conference
or the general situation for publication.
Senator Hanna returned to Washington
to-nisht. /
President Mitchell and his colleagues
sent the following telegram addressed to
the secretaries of the three anthracite
districts:
Strauss said: â¢Â¦
We are very hopeful that there will be an
agreement that will prevent a long and disas
trous strike. ; .
The miners' .representatives have pledged
themselves to Withdraw the threat of a par
tial strike on April 1. Both sides are to take
time to connider the representations made to
day, and the committee Is to meet Inside of
thirty days and hear the results of this de
liberation. An acreement eeems likely.
Mitchell agreed to withdraw the order
temporarily, to give opportunity for the
second conference which Senator Hanna
is to call. .When Senator Hanna came
from the conference room he said: v â¢ -Â¦Â¦
Will Hold Another Conference.
Â¦ Second â The officials of the companies would
meet committees consisting of employes to
discuss and adjust all -grievances. The mem
bers of the committee must be persons In the
employ of the companies, .but the matter of
their appointment woujd" not be Inquired into,
either as to their religion, politics or member
ship in labor organizations.
Third â The coal must be prepared to meet
the market requirements, 'and the output of
the mines must be maintained at their produc
tive capacity, and In no way interfered with.
The presidents also made the point that
the ultimatum of the union to strike on
April 1 did not give proper time for a dis
cussion of. the differences existing and
seemed like a threat held over them.
President Mitchell and his assistants
said they were highly desirous of Improv
ing the condition of their. fellow workmen
by peaceful means and that while there
was any prospect, of accomplishing this
purpose by 'such means they were pre
pared to' withhold the strike order. '
The labor leaders' contended that the
men were not given satisfactory pay and
that there were inequalities in the pres
ent wage system which should be rem
edied by the adoption of a uniform scale.
They also held that the working day
should be shortened.
The operators contended that the higher
pay and shorter day demanded would rep
resent a wage increase of 23 per cent,
which commercial conditions did not war
rant. The presidents of the coal com
panies outlined three propositions and said
that under no circumstances would they
recede. These propositions were as fol
lows:
First â There should be no distinction between
union and non-union men. â¢ Â¦
Inequality of Wage System.
NEW YORK, March 27.â Mine ..workers
and mine owners of /the anthracite fields
debated their difficulties; for four, hours
to-day in a conference' arranged by the
conciliation committee of the National
Civic Federation, but the meeting was
without result, save that the workers
agreed not to strike on April; 1, as decided
~ht the Shamokin convention. '< There is to
be further friendly discussion between the
two Interests and Senator Hanna was em
powered to call another "conference att
any favorable time within the next thirty
days. The workers asked for an increase
in pay, a shortening of the working day
to eight hours and the adoptlonof a scale
for the entire district. The operators de
clined to grant the : demands, as to time
and pay and refused to permit the com
plete unionizing of their properties. .The
operators* offered to meet with the em
ployes to discuss grievances at any -time,
t>ut insisted that there be no distinction
between union and non-union men. . They
also asserted that the present market con
ditions did not warrant any increases in
wages or a decrease in working time.
Senator Hanna,- Oscar S. Strauss and
Frank Duncan, a . sub-committee named
by the conciliators, arranged for the con
ference, which was held at the Church
Mission house. The operators present
were W. H. Truesdale, president of the
Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
Railroad; E. B. Thomas, chairman of the
board of- the Erie Railroad; George S.
Baer of the Reading Railroad and Robert
Oliphant. president of the Delaware and

NEW YORK, March 27.â Albert T. Pat
rick, who was convicted last night of the
murder of William M. Rice, had a con
sultation to-day with his father. Colonel
Patrick, and his counsel. Turner of Chi
cago. In discussing his case Patrick said:
As a lawyer I do not see how, upon the tes
timony given, the verdict- could; have been
found. I do not believe had Recorder GolT an<l
Assistant District Attorney Osborne known
what effect their addresses would have upon
the Jury that they would have made them In
the terms they did.
Patrick discussed the handwriting testi
mony and the testimony which was ex
cluded concerning the actions of Rice
when he made his will. He spoke also of
the testimony which he said would have
been given In his favor by Schepfell, who
was the dead millionaire's friend for fif
teen years, and also the testimony offer
ed by Adams regarding Rice's views on
cremation. Speaking of the handwriting
testimony Patrick said that the signa
tures to the four disputed checks varied
only in ! the same way as the signatures
to any .'similar number of papers would
vary. He said that only an expert could
detect that difference. Concerning other
testimony the convicted man said:
How can the declaration and determination
Â¦o* a dead man ' bear evidence except through
the testimony of a third party? It is done
every day In the Surrogate's Court. .
After expressing the belief that both
the Recorder and Assistant District At
torney were astonished at the verdict,
Patrick said: Â«.-.;<>
I believe the Jury to be composed of honest
men. I have no reason to believe otherwise.
I practically selected the Jury myself. But
this I do know: Every witness, every one
connected with me who could be bribed, ca
joled or influenced was approached, and if in
fluence could possibly be used upon any mem
ber of the Jury I believe it was used. .1 do
not believe for a moment that this verdict
will stand. . It will so to the Court of Appeals,
where the 'questions of law and fact will be
passed upon.
Patrick said further that there was not
one action on his part that he regretted,
not one thing he would not do over again.
' Asked if he would go on the stand in
the event of a new trial, Patrick said he
was in his lawyers' hands and would do
whatever they directed.

NEW YORK. March 27.-John S. Ken
nedy, banker, was recalled to-day for
cross-examination In the hearing of thc
suit of Peter Power against the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company. He said he
bought a block of Northern Pacific stock,
about $5,000,000 worth, in 1S96. There was
no agreement on his part with any one
as to how he was to vote or sell his
Northern Pacific stock. Kennedy held
about $10,000,000 of Great Northern
stock, which was voted by J. J. Hill on a
proxy. The formation of the' Northern
i*aclnc was not dependent upon the ac
quirement of either Great Northern or
Northern Pacific. The witness never
heard that there was any question or dis
cussion to the effect that the Northern
becurities Company was organized to se
cure a majority of stock of both roads to
maintain rates and control competition.
w. P. Ciough, vice president of the
Northern Securities Company, was then
called. Boutelle of counsel for Power
yuestloned him.
"You have testified that a large amount
of Great Northern stock was never trans
ferred to the Northern Securities Com
pany. Will you explain this?"
"The purchase of about 500 shares was
completed, but negotiations for about 300,
000 were not completed,"
Ciough declined to say whether the
Northern Securities Company had receiv
ed dividends on the Great Northern stock
held by it. He said that Charles Stecle
of J. P. Morgan & Co., George P. Baker
Jr. and A. B. Hepburn held proxies for the
Northern Pacific stock in the possession
of the Northern Securities Company.
"As to the proxies for the Great North
ern stock," said Ciough, "my memory Is
not so good, but I think It is held by J.
J. Hill and by Edward Sawyer in Hill's
absence."
Witness said $250,000,000 worth of North
ern Securities stock had been issued.
This concluded the examination of Col
onel Clough. Attorney Kelloggr of coun
eel for the Northern Securities Company
asked for an adjournment until Satur
day. At that session, he said," he wished
to examine Mr. Perkins of the firm of J.
P. Morgan & Co. He also notified Bou
telle that there were certain slight cor
rections to be made in the testimony of
Morgan and it was agreed that these
â¢would be â¢ made in writing and entered
upon the record.
Kellogg also asked that Peter Power,
the plaintiff In this suit, be produced at
the next session. Reply was made that
Power would be produced' as soon as the
direct testimony was in.
It was then agreed that the adjourn
ment taken to-day should be subject to
the call of the examiner and it was said
that it probably would be three weeks
before the next session will be held.
E. H. Harriman is to be the next wit
ness examined.

A circular issued by the Japanese Government an
nounces that while the- prime object in establishing
the foreign exhibit building is to afford the Japanese
themselves an opportunity to study the best products
of Western invention, the enterprise will also offer
to foreign manufacturers an opportunity for "ex
ploiting the rapidly developing markets of the whole
Far East," inasmuch as it is expected that the exhi
bition will be largely attended, not only by Japanese,
but by. many, victors from other Asiatic countries. It
is contemplated to exhibit samples of such foreign ar
ticles as, may be of -value for . purposes' of industrial
comparison and reference, and no charge for space is
to be exacted. ! ] ; v
While a single building, however large it is likely
to be, will afford but scant room for a full exhibit
of the manufactures cf the competing nations of the
world, it will surely be worth our while to make such
exhibit as we can. California at least has a sufficient
interest in the Japanese trade to justify a considerable
expenditure of money and energy in making a good
showing of her products which are fitted for the Jap
anese market.
ON behalf of his Government the secretary of
the Japanese legation at Washington has re
quested . that the attention of the American
people be called to the fact that a special building for
the exhibition of foreign manufactures is to be added
to the Japanese national exposition to be held' next
year at Osaka. /It is the desire of the Japanese
Government that our manufacturers send rxhib.its in
order that trade between the two countries may be
increased to their mutual advantage. Â¦

PEBSONAL MENTION.
During the week that the Imperial Coun
cil will be in session there will be .a num
ber ot interesting features, but one of the
most interesting will be the parade of the
Arab patrols and then the drill by the
patrol of Islam Temple, which will take
place In the Mechanics' Pavilion. The
seating, capacity of that e*dlflce will be in
creased so as ,to accommodate at least
20,000 people. Â¦"> ' "Cv. ! - i
Colonel Charles H. Murphy, .potentate
of Islam. Temple, has received a communi
cation from Philip C. Schaeffer, the im
perial potentate, saying that the Shrin
ers of the East are very much enthused
on the subject of the visit to the Golden
West and that he will use his best en
deavors to fill San Francisco with nobles
of the red fez.
The executive committee, that is arrang
ing for the reception of the thousands of
strangers who will visit this city with
the delegates to the .Imperial Council,
have made arrangements by which there
will be reduced rates by rail and steam
ers for those who. will come to San Fran
cisco and an opportunity will" be given
to the visitors to remain for a stated
period after the session so they may go
to different parts of the State, see Its im
mensity and study Its productiveness.
At a meeting of Islam Temple of the
Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of
the My'stlc Shrine,' helrt on ."Wednesday"
night, the members subscribed the sum of
$21,500 toward the fund that la being raised
for the purpose of entertaining the Im
perial Council of the order, that is to meet
in Its twenty-eighth annual session in
this city next June. It is expected from
reports that have been received that about
15,000 Eastern Shriners, in addition to
those from the Pacific -slope; will be in
this city during Shriner week. It will re
quire about $20,000 more to keep up the
reputation of the Shriners of this city for
hospitality.
Offenses of that kind, and they have been numer
ous on the part of Gage, are not going to be over
looked. The Republican press of, the State began by
protesting against Gage's shameless efforts to. coax
or bully honest Republican members of the Legisla
ture into voting for Dan Burns for the Senate,' and
since that time they have had frequent occasions to
make further protests. Now, reviewing his. whole
record in office, they warn the party that his renomi
nation will mean* defeat
This phase of the political situation presents an
issue which cannot be overlooked and should not be
shirked. There is at present no formidable opposi
tion to the Republican delegation in Congress. The
outlook for the Congressional campaign is bright
and promising. If any Congressman, however, shows
himself an active ally of the bosses in the scheme to
force the renomination of. Gage the outlook in his
district will be speedily clouded over. Republicans,
already disgusted with the use of the Federal brigade
under Lynch in the service of Herrin, Kelly, Burns
and the rest, would be roused to indignation if the
services of Congressmen were degraded to the same
disreputable ends. A word to the wise is sufficient.
No Republican Congressman can afford to take
political oiders from the Democratic boss and attor
ney for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Neither can
he afford to join the gang that is striving to bring
about the renomination of Billy Herrin's man Gage.
The Republican papers of California that are now
t-xposing the schemes of the bosses have no other
object than that of saving 'the party from a domina
tion that threatens it with disaster. Gage cannot be
rc-clecicd. He has given offense to nearly all classes
of honest Republicans. His administration has been
mean, narrow, vicious and corrupting. He has been
ready at any time to sacrifice the welfare of the State
and the honor of the Republican party for the sake
of sen-ing the base interests of the most pernicious
men now in California politics. People have not-for
gotten how fulsomcly, unctuously and repeatedly he
declared during his campaign for the Governorship
that he had no alliance with the Southern Pacific
Railroad, nor how immediately upon his taking of
fice he began intriguing in combination with Herrin
to procure the election of the notorious Dan Burns
to the United States Senate. They have not forgot
ten how even the welfare of helpless feeble-minded
children was sacrificed by the discharge of Dr. Os
borne for the sake of making a fat place for a worth
less politician.
The activity of Internal Revenue Collector Lynch
in the work of the bosses shows that in their despera
tion they are going to make Federal politics subser
vient to State politics. They will endeavor to com
pel or coax members of Congress to take part in the
campaign for the discredited Gage. Appeals will be
made to Congressmen to help the Governor, to
come into the camp and to take an active part in
carrying out the schemes of the bosses in the Repub
lican State convention. Â¦
â¢ T"^UBLIC opinion has already declared itself
\r** against the scheme of the bosses to re'dect
Â¦*- Gage. The prevailing tone of the press in all
sections of the State is antagonistic to the scheme.
The leading represent?tives of the Republican press
have been notably emphatic in denouncing not only
that scheme but the bosses, who by their efforts to
force the renominatioit of their tool show a deter
i mination to rale or ruin the party.
The leader of the bosses, Billy Herrin, being a
Democrat, cares little whether the Republican party
be ruined or not. He would willingly and perhaps
gladly sacrifice every other candidate on the Repub
lican ticket for the sake of electing <lage. - Kelly,
Burns, Crimmins, Burke and Lynch, though calling
themselves Republicans, are doubtless in full sym
pathy with the Democratic boss. They, like Billy,
would be willing and prompt to compromise the
political prospects not only, of the Republican State
and county tickets but of the Congressional tickets
as well for the sake >f keeping in the Governor's of
fice the man who has placed all the spoils of politics
; in their hands, arid who in their interests has even
; made use of the State Normal School at San Jose
and the Home for Feeble-Minded. Children to supply
places for members of the gang.

ABLE TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPH! IN COLOR. HE SAYS THE PRO

All of these things are but reports and rumors.
The whole discussion is in the' air, and that renders it
the m6rc interesting, for it gives something of mys
tery to the matter. Since everybody is pleased with
Roosevelt and the party firmly approves his policy as
a. whole, why should there be at this time so much
talk of a rival? "Why should that rival be the SenaÂ«
tor from Ohio? It hiay be there is nothing in the
affair, but talk, but it begins to look as if something
were doing.
Only one observer has noted anything that even
so much as seems like a desire on the part .of Hanna
to antagonize the President, and he goes no further
than to say that Hanna is holding firmly* the control
of the Republican machine in the Southern States and
will be able to throw it as he pleases at the Presiden
tial convention, so that if Roosevelt should lose his
popularity before that, time, and Hanna should re
gain his 1 health, it might be he would seek the nomi
nation for himself.
Public opinion in Washington City' holds strongly
to the belief that Hanna is not and will 'not be a can
didate. It is said there that not only does Roosevelt's
popularity preclude any rivalry, but the health of the
Senator is too uncertain and weak to permit him to
think of undertaking the Presidency. The two men
are working in harmony," and there have been no evi
dences of friction. Moreover, Senator Hanna's re
peated assertions to Washington correspondents that
ne is not a candidate are accepted by them as sin
cere. The New York drift, therefore, seems to
amount to nothing from the point of view of the
national capital, and the talk of Hanna for the Presi
dency, is treated as but the beginning of the usual idle
discussions of the silly season.
It is said that the gentlemarfciwho made that re
port, Mr. Henry Dougherty, is not a member of the
\Hanha faction in Ohio, and that consequently his
observations in" New York were not prejudiced in
favor of the Senator. It would seem, then, that it
may be accepted as a fact that the elements in New
York that have been opposed to Roosevelt "at every
step in his career are at work now in trying to form
a sentiment in favor of the man whom they deem
most likely to be able to defeat him.
liave said: "I was surprised at the talk in the East
favorable to Mr. Hanna for the Presidency, but my
surprise was only occasioned by finding the sentiment
so widespread so long before the nomination is to be
made. There is no cause for surprise in. the fact that
the East -looks upon Senator Hanna as an available
man. His splendid abilities as a business man appeal
to the business interests of the country. Business
men know that prosperity returned to the country
under the business administration of' President Mc-
Kinley, whose able adviser Senator Hanna was. They
know, too, that times of storm and trouble may come
again, and it is only natural they should seek a con
tinuance not only of the policies but of the men who
have proved In previous storms that they are safe and
trustworthy navigators."
A short time ago an Ohio politician, of note vis
ited New York for the purpose of finding out the
drift of public opinion in that 'city on the Presiden
tial question, and on his return home is. reported to
0N1S of the strangest features .of the -political
situation is the persistent discussion of Sen*
Mm' I hiiiim RR a Presidential eandldnt@ in
1994. There Is no apparent weakening iof Reose
velt'i prestige In the eountryi nor any manifest eauae
why he should not be nominated, 1 but still the tnlk of
Hftnna goes on. The Senator himself has done well
nigh everything a man can do to put'' a stop to the
dUcussion, but without avail. He hns even announced
that if there.be no other way to prevent his friends
from booming him for the nomination, he would
come out for free trade, Not even that has stopped
the talk, and .despite himself the Senator from Ohio
is being forced into the position of a candidate for
the Presidency in rivalry to Roosevelt.
HANNA AND THE PRESIDENCY.
Senator Simmons of North' Carolina has risen to
predict that the Democrats will carry the country in
1904 if they can get rid of Bryan, but for all prac
tical purposes he might aÂ» well have predicted that
they will elect Bryan if they^can oarry the country^

PREPARATIONS
FOR WELCOMING
THE SHRINERS
A. HYATT VERRILL., a youngr Yala
graduate, living: In New Haven.
Conn., has succeeded In; photo
' graphing in colors. Hla process*
is a secret which he refuses to
make public, although he has received
; many generous' offers! He has even de
cided not to have the process patented as
yet, because that would necessitate plac
ing the formula for the emulsion and "for
his lenses in thfe Patent Office, where the
reports would' be accessible to investiga
tors.
Verrlll believes that he is not yet at the
goal of his discovery. He has conquered
the difficulties that stood in the way of
every color except the bright red. But he
is sanguine and he says that he will have
all of them . under ] control in a few
months. "Verrill is a son of Addlson E.'
.Verrill, professor of zoology and curator
of, the zoological collection at .Tale. Pro
fessor VerriU aided and encouraged his
eon through the five years of his experi
ments. , :-*.;
Verrill is specializing scientific photog
raphy. His work consists very largely in
illustrating natural life specimens for the
Yale professors' works, and for scientific
.publications. In conjunction with his
'father's researches (he has . been led to
make strikingly fine photographs of
animal life, bird life, fish and marine
subjects, . and latterly he has branched
out on an independent quest dealing with
the evolution of the cicada. .Speaking of
his work Verrill said: : .â¢ ;Â¦-: ..
â¢'It is unfair .to ask me to tell by what
process I do this, for that "would be
throwing away Â¦" the ' researches of five
years, a good deal of money and even the
credit for the discovery. I am free to
say, however/that the process is auto
chromatic and entirely photo-chemical. It
depends upon two factorsâ llrst, the plates
and negatives, whioh are reBensitlzed bo
ns to be fully five times as sensitive to
the red colors as the ordinary negative,
and secondly, It depends for success upon
tho paper used. This is of my own make
and upon my own emulsion, which pre
ventB the red from going black and tho
blue going whlto.
"The real secret ih in the composition at
tho emulsion upon tho papers, for that
matter t have had thÂ« lenses which 1 usd

Reviewing the matter in perfect calmness, one is
moved to advise the General that he will probably
make a better before-dinner than after-dinner
speaker. His speech was made after a banquet afthe
Marquette Club. We are not aware of the General's
personal habits, but his speech was in the temper
that is incited by the use of hot, rebellious liquors.
It is held by both civil and military authorities in
the Philippines that permanent pacification of the
people is desirable, to the end that we may begin
their elevation and advancement in the ways of peace.
Members of the Philippine Commission have even
gone so far as to say that the presence of military
camps in the towns ir. the cause "of friction and
trouble. There is a substantial agreement that so far
placation of the masses has failed. It was a military
boast that Samar was to be besomed and "made a
desert where even a bird could not live." If there be
any substitute for such drastic measures it should be
found and tried. The proposition of the petitioners
that the leaders of the native people be consulted in
search of such substitute has in it every element of
reason. In every war with our red Indians that pol
icy has been followed by our military officers.
Crook did.it with the Sioux and Miles with the
Apaches. In each case it succeeded, and further
bloodshed was averted. To sign such a petition in
volves no turpitude, no opposition to whatever our
permanent policy in the Philippines may be, no un
patriotic attitude toward our Government or institu
tions. Time was that Southern slaveholders denied
to Northern free men the right of petition. But since
the vindication of that right by John Quincy Adams
on the floor of the House no voice has been raised
against- it until this brigd'dicp general in the regular
army proposes to hang citizens of the United States
for exercising It.
Quoting his exact language, as reported, itg often*
livene'sg ii apparent. He said: "Two negro soldiers
deserted our army and for & time served In the In
mii >:r itt tinny. They were caught and hanged, It
would have been more an set of justice had we
hanged the people who signed the recent petition to
Congress asking that we confer with the Philippine
leaders In an effort to secure peaee. In the one case
two ignorant beings were executed, while in the
other people more guilty than they and In full pos
session of their senses were allowed to go free."
Insolence can go no further, Signing a petition
for consultation looking to peace is denounced as
more deserving of the gallows than desertion to the
enemyl It, is language unbecoming an officer and
a gentleman, and nothing can make the army, the
administration and all concerned more unpopular
than to permit it to go unrebuked and unresented.
Among the signers of that petition were stout sup
porters of the administration. Its signatories were
not the opponents of any Government policy. They
appeared as -the friends of their country and its au
thorities. They merely suggested, from the body of
the people, a public policy. To do this there was no
way open to them except by petition. Among the
signers were Wayne Mac Veagh, Senator Edmunds,
the presidents of nearly all the. American universities
and the leading clergymen of all denominations, and
leading professional and public men of every State
in the Union. These are the citizens whom young
Hotspur desires to hang as worse than deserters who
go over and fight for the enemy against their own
flag.
Under our system of government petition is the
recognized way of the people to the Government.
Hardly a day passes that petitions are not presented
to Congress bearing upon some policy of the Gov
ernment or advising as to its acts. Citizens have the
same right to. petition for ways. and means to secure
peace in the Philippines that they have to petition
for or against free trade with Cuba, or on any other
subject, and it is effrontery of the most offensive kind
in this general of the regular army tp bawl at them
his denunciations and yelp his opinion that they are*
worse than negroes who desert Â¦ to the enemy, and
ought to be hanged.
. Such conduct disgraces his Uniform and is preju
dicial to the army.- It is in derogation of the consti
tutional rights of American citizens, and discloses in
him an envenomed ignorance of the principles of
liberty which could not be exceeded by a padishah
or an Indian rajah of the time of the Moguls. Citi
zens who differ with the petitioners whom he de
sires, to hang do not scruple to. deprecate and rebuke
him, because the establishment of such a principle
as he advocates would mean that every revolution in
our politics would imply' proscription. The execu
tioners of to-day would stand on the gallows to-mor-
Gcneral Funston will do well to repair his inflated
condition and sheathe his unruly mouth.
THE Eastern press comments with much asper
ity.upon General Funston's "speech in. Chicago.
In that oratorical effort the General declared
for hanging the citizens who signed a petition ask
ing that our Government confer with Filipino lead
ers upon measures to end war and strife in the
islands/ : YV Â¦
GENERAL FUNSTON'S VIEWS.
YALE MAN IS MAKING A SUCCESS
OF TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS IN COLOR
A trade that shows so flourishing a condition as <
that, and is making such rapid progress, is worth
looking after. It is announced that the exhibition
will be open from March , 1 to July 31, 1903, and in
tending exhibitors are requested to forward applica-^
tioris to the office of the Chief Commissioner for the
Fifth Domestic Industrial Exhibition, in the Depart
ment of Agriculture and Commerce at Tpkio, not
later than June 30, 1902. Foreign* exhibits for the
samples building will be exempt from duty, provided
they arc withdrawn for exportation within two
months after the close of the exhibition.
With the big demands for the St. Louis exposition
out of the way for a time, there will be nothing to
prevent our giving the Japanese enterprise some at
tention. Official reports for ioqi show that during
that year the increase, in imports to Japan from the
United States was larger than the increase of imports
from any other nation. We are near to equality to
our great rivals in that market. The figures of the
imports from the various countries show that imports
from the United States have grown from 6,874,531
yen in 1890 to 42,769,725 yen in" 1901; those from
Germany, from 6,856,055 yen in 1890 to 28,320,097
yen; those from the United Kingdom, from 26,619,-.
102 to 50,575,781 yen; those from India, from 8,910,
891 yen in 1890 to 42,779,900 yen in 1901; those
from\China, from 8,849,685 yen in 1890 to 27,256,979
in 1901. ' ~ - . Â¦- â¢ -

it is physically impossible, even in/ these . days of
rapid construction/ for? the ..directors pf the exposi
tion to get the huge* buildings' ready in. time for the
installation of exhibits next spring. Under such cir
cumstances it. is clearly advisable to postpone the
opening. Where so much money, and labor are to be
expended it is better to take time enough to perfect
things than , to carry them through , with a rush and

Civil Service Commission Announces
POLICEMEN ELIGIBLE
TO BECOME CORPORALS
There are many investors who have re
ceived letters from Secretary Deane who
have reason to know that they have been
swindled. They | have no recourse except
by criminal prosecutions against the
parties who sold them their shares under
fraudulent pretenses where the companies
have passed out of existence.
It has become known that certain
parties in this city, operating with- Pike &
Co. in. the East, went into a wholesale
business in the underwriting of shares of
worthless companies. By reason of their
agency these parties took large blocks of
stock for their own share of the deal and
these have been sold in the East by the
use of full page advertisements and by
other devices by which scoundrels man
age to get â¢ away the money of the un
wary. Some of the shares in the com
panies that are known here to have been
absolutely only paper concerns are still
being sold in the East.
There Is a great'stlr in the East con
cerning stocks in California oil companies
judging by the floods of letters of inquiry
that are burdening the mails. Investors
from about every Eastern State are wrlt
tlng both to State Mineralogist Aubury
and Secretary C. T. Deane of the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners' Association,
asking about the value of stocks they
have been led to purchase. According to
the estimate of Secretary Deane there
are 2500 less California oil companies in
existence now than there were two years
ago. A large share of these now defunct
companies sold stock in the East and tne
letters indicate that some of the com
panies placed many thousands of dollars'
worth of their stock. State Mineralogist
Aubury and Secretary Deane are both
compelled to write in answer to inquiries
that hundreds of the companies have
ceased to exist and. investors have lost all
their money. Some companies never own
ed any land nor even a lease, v
Jolting the Jolts has therefore not be
come the most successful and popular of
Eports.
The Board of Works has yet another
complaint to face, for it has deliberately
allowed Van Ness avenue to become the
dumping ground for heaps of cobble
stones and other masonry, making one of
the handsomest thoroughfares in the city
a positive eyesore. The residents along
the avenue are stirred to indignation
over such astounding action on the part
of the board and protest in the most vig
orous manner against turning any part
of it into a corporation stone yard.
Folks are asking, "What is the matter
Â¦with Manson? What is wrong with Men
dell? What has happened to Casey?"
Another member of the Board of Works
is Marsden Manson, who. with tho rare
eccomplishment of a civil enirtneer. is
quite aware that the state of some of tho
streets of the city, and especially the
two popular avenues so much used by
drivers, is deplorably bad; and Michael
Casey, the other member of the board,
knows well the disadvantages of bad
roads. He is president of the Teamsters'
Union and for years was a teamster hlm
eelf. and can therefore appreciate the dlf-
Jcrence between a good and a bad read.
Besides the . ccrp* of inspectors" of
streets, there are special inspectors who
are supposed to report on the condition
of the thoroughfares. â¢
Some of these officials are in receipt
of $100 a month, and are supplied with
horses and bugggies that they may the
better make their inspections, while other
inspectors are receiving $125 a month,
paying their own expenses in getting
around the city. Surely with a corps of
supposedly efficient officials the present
condition if not known to the board
should be reported without delay. Some
one is delinquent in the department and
at the risk of the lives of many of the
citizens who are pardonably clamoring
for instant repairs upon Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenues.
New Sport Not Popular.
The Board of Works is Just as gen
erous with the Jolts on Golden Gate ave
rue, for in that locality matters assume
an even more exciting condition. Instead
or the hunchback crossings, drivers have
the privilege of seeing thetr horses take
a leap and often a stumble over the de
pressions in the asphalt that in some
way resembles a fox hunting scene. It
Is invigorating sport, is Jolting the Jolts,
in the much traveled localities, where it
occurs every day in the week, Sundays
included. It is an exhilarating, exciting
sight.
Hut there are some who take exception
to the conditions, and in no uncertain
voice condemn the gentlemen who hold
cilice and who are receiving the people's
money to eee to it that the thorough
lares of the city, are kept in perfect or
tier; that they be not a danger to the
driver or the pedestrian; that the necks
of the people are not put in danger of
a wrench, and that horses, valuable or
otherwise, may draw their load without
the possibility of a serious spill.
The Board of Works knows well the
conditions, and the president of the
board. Colonel George Mendell, with the
vast experience of a designer of Govern
ment fortifications and harbor defenses
and great breakwaters, must wonder at
himself when he twinkles at the uneven,
Ellpshod. dangerous, not-to-be-excusod
condition of two very important ave
nues of the city.
Resembles Fox Hunting-.
Jolting the Jolts is the In tost pastime
invented and patented by the Board of
Public Works of the city of San Francisco.
Jolting: the Jolts Is meant to rival Ping
Pong and "Chuting" the Chutes. There
is nothing like It In any other well-rcg
flated city in the great Union. Conse
quently the patentee is pardonably elated
with its new offering to the lovers of
genuine sport.
Jolting the Jolts is enjoyed by the driv
er* of San Francisco, for whom, indeed,
the exciting game is allowed to remain
in existence. The grounds upon which
Jolting the Jolts is enjoyed are on Van
>le?s and Golden Gate avenues.
A description, of the game is necessary:
Owners ot valuable horses and hand&ome
vehicles before leaving their homes to
level in the new sport usually taKe out
an accident insurance policy, tor there is
r.o telling what may happen.
They then proceed to the avenues des
ignated and tue sport commences. The ex-
spots are at the various crossings, ln
aeed there is not a crossing on Van Ness
avenue that is level wiih the general
foadbed, and consequently the wabbly
pane of Jolting the Jolts is uninterrupt
ed, and, more, it is attended with a dan
ger to the .neck of the horse and the
fpinal column of the driver and occu
pants of the carriages, buggies and wag
ons, that meets exactly with the excit
ing -conditions looked lor. .
Chairman Braunhart announced that
City Attorney Lane is working on his
opinion in answer to questions regarding
the acquisition of the Geary-street road
as a municipal road and will probably
render it by next Thursday's meeting of
the committee,- when the matter will be
taken up. The proposed. Improvement of
Telegraph Hill and the acquisition of new
schoolhouses will be considered at the
stime/time. .*Â¦:
Sunnyslde District, eight-class school, $40,
000; Mission, Five-mile District, twelve-class
school. $C0,000; South San Francisco District,
slxteen-class school, $100,000; Nuevo Potrero
District, fourteen-class school. ?80;000; Eureka
Valley' and Park -Lane District, elght-clasa
school $40,000; Ocean View District, twelve
class school, $00,000; Precita Valley District,
eight-class school, $40,000.
The committee also recommended the
transfer of a school lot on Sixteenth street
hetween Noe and Sanchez streets to tne
Public Library Trustees as a site for a
branch library. The Supervisors are to
purchase a lot In the neighborhood of Six
teenth and Noe streets to replace the lot
transferred. The Board of Education was
requested to report available sites for *l<a
erection of new schoolhouses proposed to
be acquired by bond issues. Consideration
of new schoolhouses will be taken up r.t
next Thursday's meeting.
The communication of the Federation
ot Mission Improvement Clubs, designat
ing where new schoolhouses are needed
in the Mission, South San Francisco and
Potrero districts was referred to the
Finance Committee. The list follows:
Now Schoolhouses Needed.
President Denman of the Eoard of Edu
cation said that he deemed the Fifth and
Market street site as the best location for
a library, but not the best for a public
school. Trustee John H. Wise of the Pub
lic Library said that he favored the Fifth
street site since the Mechanics Pavilion
offer had been withdrawn.
J. Aubrey Jones, who has offered to sell
a block f<n Van Ness avenue, between
Grove and Fulton streets, for the library
site, objected to the selection of the Fifth
street site because of the noisy surround
ings. Dr. C. D. Salfleld favored the Van
Ness avenue site and opposed the Fifth
street site o:i the ground that he did not
believe In "removing a monument to
the hero of the War of the Rebellion to
replace It by a monument to the hero of
Homestead." â¢'
L. M. King, secretary of the Merchants
Association, favored the Fifth street site,
provided the condemnation of the leases
on the stores did not cost too much.
School Director Roncovlerl favored the
use of the whole Lincoln School site for
the 'library. Supervisor Wynn opposed
the Fifth street site because it would pre
vent the people'from expressing their de
sires at the polls as to whether or not
they are in favor of accepting Carnegie's
often The only way to let the people
have a voice is to purchase a new site,
for which bonds would have to be Issued,
Bald Wynn.
The Public Library Trustees petitioned
the committee to recommend that in
making up the next tax levy the library
be allowed the maximum rate allowed
by the charter of 2ft cents, on $100, which
would net $100,000. Of this amount the
Trustees pledge themselves to expend be
tween $&*>.C0(.- and $37,000 In the purchase of
branch sites. Under this arrangement the
Trustees believe that suitable sites could
be secured at lens cost than under a bond
issue. Tho communication was referred
to the Finance Committee.
Fifth-Street Site.
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee recommended Â¦ yesterday that the
Lincoln School lot, consisting of 175 feet
frontage on Fifth street with a depth of
275 feet, be transferred from the School
Department to the Trustees of the Public
Library for the purpose of erecting there- ,
on the main library building, for the con
structlon of which Andrew Carnegie has
donated the sum of $750,000. The building
will be known as the "San .Francisco Pub
lic Library." In selecting the site the
committee has eliminated entirely the
frontage on Market street, on which are
stores from which the city collects $4000
monthly In rentals.
The members of the Board of Educa
tion, who were present when the declsloi.
was taken, agreed to the transfer of the
school property with the proviso that the"
Board of Supervisors make provision for
the purchase of a site for a building to
replace the Lincoln School in the vicinity
of Seventh and Howard streets. Shouid
the site recommended be accepted by the
Board of Supervisors, it will obviate the,
necessity ot submitting the proposition to
a vote of the "yecple, v/hich would have
to be done if a new site â¢were purchased
by bond issue.

SICK MAN WEDS
DEVOTED NURSE
Romantic Night Mar
riage of Dr. C. S. Nel
lis to Miss Reddy.
Groom Is Wealthy Physician
and Bride a Well-Known
Teacher.
Suffering untold tortures from aneu
rism of the heart and confined to his bed
for a period of eight â¢ months. Dr. Col
borne S. Nellls, a well-known physician,
was married to the woman of his choice
at the Russ House at 10 o'clock Tuesday
evening. The bride was Miss Margaret
Reddy, a school teacher, and It was her
careful nursing during the past three or
four months that won the sick man's af
fection. The groom Is past sixty, but the
age of the bride is .not disclosed.
Dr. Nellla fancied that he was dying
and the Idea entered his mind that his
friend and nurse should inherit his estate,
which is said to be considerable. He
broached the subject to Miss Reddy and,
on her assenting to the proposition, a
messenger was dispatched in hot hastÂ©
for Rev. John Stephens. A couple of the
friends of the contracting couple were
also summoned and the twain were made
one. The sick man made the customary
responses in a weak voice and It was
plain that he was in great pain. The af
fair created considerable gossip in the
hotel in which Nellis had resided for more
than twenty years.
Acting on the advice of his wife, Nellia
wa3 taken to the home .of her relatives
at 706 Pine street on Wednesday morning.
The groom received callers yesterday an<1
was congratulated upon the auspicious
event.- Nellls was very ill last night and
a report was circulated that he was dying.
When a Call reporter visited the hou^e
the inmates declined to discus? the aged
groom's condition except to say that the
publicity given the affair was most an
noying both to him and to .Mrs. Nellls.
It was learned from other sources, how
ever, that Nellis' malady is a fatal one
and that he cannot Ions survive.
Nellls lost considerable money by tha
failure of the Pacific Bank. He still has
property of considerable value, however.
When he was taken ill some eight months
ago Miss Reddy visited him frequently.
She was at that time a teacher in the
Irving Primary School, and when his con
dition became serious she devoted her
sole attention to him, with the result that
the marriage followed.

SALT LAKE, March 27.â Litigation in
volving approximately $3,000,000 has been
brought to an end. by an agreement
reached to-day for. the consolidation of
the Daly "West Mining Company and the
Quincy Mining Company, both of Park
City. Utah. The Daly West Company is
to increase its capitalization and take
over the Quincy company. The former
company is paying dividends at the rate
of $00,000 a month! and the latter
pany at the rate of $125,000 a month.
Although no official announcement has
been made It is understood that the Daly
"West will increase its capitalization from
150,000 shares to 200,000 shares, the 50,000
additional being issued to the Quincy
shareholders. The Daly West, which is
owned largely in Cincinnati, New York
and Boston, being listed on the Boston
Exchange, has the larger territory. The
Quincy, owned by Michigan and Utah
holders, is a small but , extremely rich
mine. Both are producers of silver, lead,
gold and copper.
On the strength of the prospects of an
agreement Daly West stock has jumped
In two days on the Salt Lake Exchange
from $30 to $36 a share, closing strong this
affrnoon. The various lawsuits which
have been brought on both sides will be
dismissed. The Daly West Company
brought suit about a month ago against

unlawfully extracting ore from Daly

shortly before had reincorporated under
the laws of Colorado in order to bring
suit in the Federal court. The Quincy
Company filed an answer, claiming the
apex of the lode and demanding $1,000,OOJ
from the Daly West for mining on its
lode. Several other suits were filed, mak
ing the total amount in litigation $3,000,

all mining in the disputed territory, cur
tailing the output of both mines. Corps
of experts were engaged by both sides
and preparations were made for a bitterly
fought and long drawn out legal battle.
The litigation became complicated and it
was estimated that at least $250,000 would
be spent in legal expenses. A couple of
weeks ago negotiations were opened for
a compromise, resulting to-day in an

As for Douglas, he had all of the exter

He was accounted a good workman, but
his employers know nothing more about
him. His time of residence at San Leandro
had been exactly twenty-five days when
he departed last evening. Douglas is 35
.and thereabouts. -He said he was married
and had a wife and children in Fresno
County. Douglas went to San Leandro,
he announced, to earn a living for himself
and his family. His associates Icnow
nothing more about him.
Thus it is that the mystery of this
"Jack the Hugger" has been solved to the
satisfaction, at least of some of those who
have been most directly concerned in the
strange experiences that have aroused the
San Leandroites during the last three
weeks.
- : Justice Quinn, to whom Miss Rose ap
plied for the arrest.of Douglas, said: "The
young woman's condition is such that she
is not fit to appear In court and give her
testimony. I have advised that she should
delay action until she has quite recovered
from the nervous shock and excitement."

Fresno County, who gave his name as E.

affair and desired to gite me some infor

cleared that Douglas formerly resided at
Clovis and that he had been there charged
"with attempting to be unduly familiar

â¢ An addition to ! the' already large show
was made yesterday In: the purchase of a
fine pair of llamas," atva; cost of '$1000. Im
mediately after. ' the .--.handsome animals
had. been delivered at the Pavilion Mr.;
Norrls, who, trains the 'performers of thej
show, took possession -of them and tried,
to "get a llne'^on what work -they would;
do. The team followed Â¦ their master, and
seemed contented, in their new home._ , ;
Llamas in "their mountain homes ; are
used as beasts of burden and the > next
step of the trainer- was to try them: on j
that line. A small boy was placed astride,
of one of the beasts and at once the
gentle animal started a rough show that
would have put the efforts of the bucK-
Ing pony to the blush. No amount 01
cajoling would induce either of the llamas
to play saddle horse. Â¦
The services of Jim Rooinson. the trie*
riding, monk, were brought into play as
a last resort. When Jim was led into the'
presence of the show's latest acquisition
he seemed to know what was expected 01
him and it was not long before he became
quite friendly with, the pair. Gradually
the ape was brought closer and finally
he was placed on the back of one of the
llamas. \ - Â¦ .- , ,,
After a short "broncho bustinK act
the llama eased down- and submitted to.
the rider. ' When Jim attempted to do a
somersaull, however, the fun commenced.
but the monk stuck to his work and.
finally accomplished the trick. When the
exhibition was over Jim acted as if he
had enjored it. â¢
. Mr. " Norrls feels satisfied that before
Â¦next season's opening: lie will make the
work of the Hamas a feature, that is if
Jim Robinson holds his own.
One of the greatest' obstacles that con-.'
fronts the Norris&.Rb we. trained animal'
show is the- constant, demand forr n6W
features that will* satisfy its patrons.' The.
managers are'; always- 'on the lookout'for.
a strong act in.: thei animal line and a.nyi
novel turn that can be thought of is given;

"It was during the evening of March S,
between 8 and 9 o'clock, that this man
accosted me," said Miss Rose. "I had
been out to get. some medicine for my
Elster' 6 baby, who was 111, and was hurry
ing home when this man stepped up to
me and t-aid, 'Good evening.' '
Miss Rose resides with her elster, Mrs.
Mary Fellz, a few blocks from the cenr
ler of the town. She is 19 and comely, be
ing of the dark Latin type.
In the courtroom when Douglas was on
the witness stand Miss Rose positvely
identified him. She was as positive to-day
when she told the story of the "hug
ger's" actions. Intense excitement since
the occurrence has quite unnerved the girl
and she has been seriously m from its
effects. * Â¦ -
It was the advances made toward ixiss
Silva which led to the attack upon Doug
las by her friondsâ Frank Burnett, Joseph
Claudio. Joseph Dlas, Antonio Gomes
and Thomas Galvin. Gomes Is probably
responsible for avenging the assault. He
is a. relative by marriage of Miss Rose,
who had her experience with the man a
.short time belore the Silva incident oc
curred. Gomes had informed friends of
Miss Rose. They declare they had lo
cated Douglas by description and were
ready for him when Miss Silva appealed
to them.
After the preliminary hearing at San
Leandro belore Justice Quinn, which re
sultfd In the discharge of the accused
youths, Douglas disappeared. Inquiry
made to-day at his stopping place, the
Kan Leandro Hotel, elicited the informa
tion that he had gone to Oakland to visit
friends. Chris Christenson, proprietor of
the hotel, had no other word of his board
er's whereabouts. â¢
And all of this, stir was created and de
veloped from the arrest of five young
men, charged by Douglas with having
beaten and robbed him. There was no
doubt about the beating. He was badly
bandied and so seriously injured that he
was and is still incapacitated. But his
assailants had a very different story to
tell about the asEault. They freely ad
mitted their part in it, but avowed tnat
Douglas was thrashed because he had
insulted Miss Silva and Miss Rose.

OAKLAND, March 27.â If Joseph
Douglas, mechanic at the Best
Agricultural Works, San Lean

Hugger," who has been terroriz
ing the young women of San Leandro,. he
is the victim of an extraordinary con
catenation of circumstances. Despite the
flattest kinds of denials, Douglas is pos>i
tlvely identified by Miss Rosie Rose and
by Miss Flora Silva as the man who dur

companied his demonstration by violently,

The names of Miss Reed and Miss Fos

On top of ail this is added the declara

The attorneys finally agreed to argue
the question upon an agreed case. Thus
a citation will be issued for Donohue, and
if he refuses to appear, punishment will
be visited upon him. He wlllbe within
call of the court, however, and will be
summoned to the witness stand,- where
his attorneys will advise. him. not to an
swer the questions that are asked of him.
In that way a question .that has never
been fully tested will be brought before
the Supreme Court for a final adjudica
tion. .:â¢., â¢ ,'. Â¦
Attorneys Bosley and Drumm for the
Laymances were unprepared to meet the
question thus raised, but expressed their
belief that the practice of taking deposi
tions Is legal. . . .: .
In a case in Contra Costa County the
Supreme Court had decided that a Notary
Public could not force- a witness to ap
pear before him { or testify if he didn't
want to; In the Enquirer case a few weeks
ago the question; as to the right of the
Court Commissioner to subpena or pun
ish was all threshed out and the decisions
all seemed to be against the Court Com
missioner; so that there was nothing left
to do but test the qualifications of a Su
perior Judge to .subpena or punish. -
Judge Hall issued a 'subpena for Dono
hue at the request of the Laymance peo
ple, but when his name was called this
morning he was not there. Attorneys
Webb and Chapman answered for him
that he would, not obey the summons of
the. court. They quoted authorities to
show that the office of a person taking
a deposition is purely ministerial, whether
ho be a Notary, Court Commissioner or
Justice of any kind, and that, under the
laws of this State, he is unable to punish
for any disobedience of his mandates.
The rights of litigants to punish their
opponents who refuse to give testimony
at deposition-takings before the calling
of trials Is about to, be tested In the
Supreme Court. A definition will then be
had upon. a question that is agitating the
courts and lawyers of the State, the ques
tion having first been raised in the at
tempt to take the deposition of G. B.
Daniels in the Encuirer suit. The out
come of the test will have a direct bear
ing on the outcome of that interesting
litigation, as it will in fact have upon all
litigation. â¢
Tne auestlon came up to-day in Judge
Hall's court, where Peter B. Donohue,
who is suing M. J. Laymance and others
for an accounting of the business of the
California Standard and Giant Oil com
panies, was summoned to give his deposi
tion. "

Slany people suffer from piles because
efter trying various lotions, salves and
ointments without relief or cure they
come to the conclusion that a surgical
operation is the last resort, and rather
than submit to the shock and risk to life
cf an operation prefer to suffer on; very
often, however, the afflicted one is over-
persuaded to resort to the knifev and even
though the operation is apparently suc-
cessful and there is complete recovery
from the shock incident thereto the result
is invariably the sabe â the piles sooner or
later return, because their cause has not
been removed. This result is a logical
one, inasmuch as the knife removes the
effects of the disease only, while the
cause remains as before. There Is claimed
to be a remedy which does remove the
cause, hence eradicating the disease, and
that is the Pyramid Pile Cure. It Is in
the form of a suppository, is applied di-
rectly to the parts affected and brings
about a complete cure, quietly and pain-
lessly. In this connection the testimony
of llr. John Cullen Bryant, the well-
known bookseller of Haverhill, Mass., is
of unusual interest.
"I desire to contribute an unsolicited
but purely voluntary testimonial iA favor
of Pyramid Pile Cure. I have suffered for
more than twenty years with hemor-
rhoids, and have consulted numerous phy-
sicians and have expended a great deal
cf money for medicines that did me no
good. I had often seen Pyramid Pile Cure
advertised, but hesitated for months be-
fore buying same, thinking it a patent or
quack remedy that had no merit; but
having tried every other ' remedy pre-
Bcrited I was finally persuaded one year
ago to try Pyramid Pile Cure. I bought
a 50-cent package at the drugstore, and
while I may not be permanently cured,
the past year has been the only year of
my life worth living during the past
twenty year^, and nothing but the Pyr-
amid remedies have wrought thi3 change.
I offer this testimony for the benefit of
suffering humanity."
Should Be the Last 'Resort.

CHICAGO, March 27.â Traders who ran to

In winter whoat hnd their fenrs allayed soon'
after the opening hour. Cnhles were t higher
on the damage .reports* and. thoro was n fair
number of buyers. Small Northwestern- re

long as corn held 'firm did wheat keep ' its

entire winter wheat crop, and the weather
was too mild not to be taken notice of. 8tatlsÂ«.
tlciins reportfd the growing crop as good, If
not better, than at first , expected^ Corn had
been expected to take a decided up turn, but
was socn belns Bold liberally Â¦ ancj weakened.
This gave . the weather an opportunity to 'be
felt to ItSvfull extent, and wheat grew sick
and staggered- downward. Liquidation and
stop-loss orders added to the decline and bears
took control. May wheat opened %cto'4Cc
higher at 73V4c to 73o, and held there for
Forr.c time. The depression took May to 71 Vic
and In pplte of! liberal covering- of short ac

XHW TORK, March 27.â The feverish and
â¢â¢rratlc 1 iÂ«-i -iiiiitLm In Colorado Fuel occupied
the lartrvKt share of attention on thÂ« Block
tCxclmnge lo-day. The violent drop of 5% in
the price of this utork was alleged to !><â¢ due to
the derjrt- of the mcraber* of the pool to nhaki;
Â«.JT a weak following. prrllmlnary to n renewed
Â«.ii\ jiiwi- in the "Â¦Â¦â¢< k. A more logical explana
tion was found tn the admission to the Stock
Kxrhanre ll*t for the flrrt time to-day of the
convertible tends of thÂ« oompary. There lias
Â».'â¢â¢!> a vrry aotlvo market on arbitrage for
thÂ«aÂ«e bolide tn the curb for some time, due to
the feet that thÂ«*y wÂ«-re considerably lower In
jrh-f than the etock wan quoted on the Â«-x-
Ojanne. The operttfOS consisted In buying of
the bends on the curb and nelllne on the "Stock
Exchange. It was necessary to borrow etock
for delivery until to-day, when the convertible
1.1.11,1* became a rood delivery against the sale
cf tne etook under the ruling of the exchange.
fii'zi to Colorado FupI the greatest activity was
in Amalgamated Copper, for which there was
en active demand, tn which brokers usually
employed by tnsld* interests were conspicuous.
The movement was believed to have been di
rected nK3ii:n the ehort interest. The stock
lc-rt most of Its gain and Colorado Fuel recov
ered a good part of Its loss, although it was
near the low point st the close. An active de
mand for Sugar sprang up late In the day, ap
parently based en the advance In the price of
nil grades of refined sugar. The amlcabie
courite of negotiations between the anthracite Â¦
miner* and the operators increased a covering â¢
movement in the coalers and caused general
edvancea throughout the group.' The* con
tinued calmners In the money market while the
demand was being made to carry over- until
Monday next relieved apprehension of a' flurry.']

The Oil Exchange was the interesting spot
in the stock market yesterday, owing to the
spurt in Sterling, which sold to the amount of.
some thousands of shares within the range of
$1 52%@1 00, with some buyers" options a frac
tion higher. The excitement in this stock is
due to the securing of a contract for 1,500.000
barrels of oil for the Hawaiian Islands at a
price which for the present is private. Sover
eign, which leases 20 acres from the Sterling
was also active in sympathy, it being hoped
that it would participate in Sterling's ' good
fortune later on. Lion also sold freely. .

there is naturally a lack or speculation, but
there are apparently no weak sellers. Prices
for Alaska range from 17s 3d to 17b Od. Cali
fornia fruits have been dull for some time past,
but there has been some improvement in the
consumptive demand this week. The John
Cooke and California have arrived at Liverpool

Good Friday.
Borne of the prominent railroad stocks had the
advantage of this movement, but the money
market was always dull and sluggish, as ia
usual on the eve of a prolonged holiday. The
widest movements were among a few special
ties. The late rally In the market caused a re
covery In the stocks which had been heavy
early In the day and wiped out most of the
losses.
An active demand for Green Bay and West
Indian Debenture B's was the feature of the
bond market. Total sales, par value, $4,610,CO0.
The recent restrlction-of operations In stocks
to the professionals had been accentuated this
week by the fact that it was to be a short
week, followed by an interim in the trading of
three days here and four days -abroad. ' So long
a period without an open market in which to
close accounts independent of some development
of importance in the financial world always In
duces caution and a closing of accounts. Many
of the brokers have anticipated the triple holi
day by starting away on trips, but some of the
largest capitalists, whese actions are watchc-J
closely for guidance, have returned from earlier
vacation jaunts, giving rise to the hope' that
important operations in the etock market would
be entered upon. This influence induced some
of the buying on Monday, which was short
lived. There has been a general acquiescence
in the -waiting attitude of the market in view
of the several doubtful factors hanging over It.
The money situation was the most important
of these doubtful factors. Call, loans, with
which stocks are held, are made on the day
preceding- a holiday to carry over until the day
of resumption of trading, and for this reason
alone the rate is likely to be run up somewhat
in placing loans at such a time. At this time
the forces of depletion of bank reserves at
work and the email surplus on hand have kept
the traders In dread all the week that there
would be a flurry In money on Thursday and
has been a repressive influence.- The varying
phases in the negotiations for settlement be
tween the miners and operators have been fol
lowed with attention and have had a greater
influence or the market at large than was in
dicated in the movements of the stocks of the
anthracite roads themselves. The development
of a strike at Lowell among textile workers and
<*<-mandB for increase of . wages among- New
England shoe operatives have helped to keep
attention on the labor question.
The beginning of additional suits in State
courts against the Northern Securities Com
pany has kept alive the apprehension surround
ing that Important probiem. and the testimony
given in a lawsuit by the principals in' the
great northwestern- railway contest has not
had a reassuring effect as to the actual results
achieved by that combat or the relations which
are the outcome. The activity of the Inter
state Commerce Commission in securing in
junctions against rebates and rate-cutting by
railroads and the announced Intention to In
vestigate the subject further have awakened
fears that this course may be a hampering in
fluence upon ra'lroad policies. The announce
ment of the United States Steel bond conver
sion plan has been awaited from day to day
and has been the subject of fOme perplexity
and divided sentiment. Â¦ . â¢
The principal activity In the bond market
nas been In- issues of a rpeculatire grad-i, taj
which the movement has been irregular.
fnite.1 States bonds were aJl unchanged as
compared with the close of. last week.

BUSINESS CHANCESâ Continued. â¢ Â¦
WE have I or sale ' rig hts for, the States of Cal-
ifornia. Oregon and Washington for the best
locked- wire lence device ever patented. ; The
owner of the patent is a practical ranch man
who has 200 miles of barbwire Â¦ fence ln the
Panhandle, and who is now - going over the
entire fence system of his ranch, putting in
. the stays with this locked-fence device. The
device has taken like wildfire In the Eastern
States. The State of Iowa alone sold for
$10.C0o. We have samples of the device at
our offlce, where It can be seen. The prin-
cipal advantace of this fence device . is that
It makes a fence that is almost indestruct-
ible; no power can move the ttays when put
on with our patent fastener and patent
wrench. If this device were adopted ln Cali-
fornia It certainly would . revolutionize fenc-
ing. The fence is cattle-proof, and by put-
ting in enough stays you can fence against
the smallest animals. The device can be. used
on ornamental fences or lor office wire woik.
The wrench and clips and possibly some
models of t^e fence can be seen at the City
Wire Works, on Main St., between Seventh
and Eighth. Mr. Blescar, the proprietor,
will be glad to explain its use. MINING IN-

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
If, as I hold, registration at "the .home port
is that intended by the sections of the Political
Code I have cited, they do not include the pre
cise category under consideration here. Inde
pendently of those sections the situs of the
Olive J. Olson is ..in San Francisco, which is
her home port; and as under the constitution
all prpperty in this State, not exempt under the
laws of the . United States.', shall be taxed In
Â¦proportion to its .value she was properly as
sessed for taxation in' this 'city.
Â¦ As all the owners of the Olive J.. Olson reside
in San Francisco that was her Â¦ home port or
port to 'which she belonged.- -.- â - â¢
United States^ Revised statutes, section 4141,
say that every vessel, except as provided -for,
shall be registered by. the -Collector of that col
lection district which includes -the port to which
such vessel shall belong at the time of her reg
istry, which port shall be deemed to be that at
or nearest to which the owner, if there be but
one, .or if more than one, the husband or acting
and managing owner of such" vessel usually re
side*. . '
The Revised-Statutes provide that whenever a
citizen f of the United- States becomes the owner
of a vessel entitled to -be registered, such ves
sel being within a district 'Other than the onÂ«
in Â¦which he usually resides, such vessel shall
be entitled to be registered by the Collector ot
the district where she may be at the time of
his becoming such owner; but that when a ves
sel so registered shall arrive within the district
comprising the. port to which she belongs .the
certificate of reelstry so obtained shall be de
livered up to the Collector of such district, who
shall give a new certificate of registration In
lieu of the first. â¢ â¢Â¦ . â¢ -..". â¢ -
j At the time of the assessment 'complained of
all the owners of the schooner resided . in ' this
city. : When they became such owners the ves
sel was at Port Townsend, Wash., and ta com
pliance with the shipping laws of the United
States she was registered by the Collector ot

i The suit of Oliver J. Olson to recover
from; this city and county certain Uaxes
paid on. the schooner. Olive J. Olson was
decided, in favor of the -defendant ". by
Judge Seawell yesterday. The suit was
a test case, and the ruling of- Judge Sea
well will be the means of adding several
thousand dollars to the- city treasury.
Olson contended that the \ vessel - was
not subject to taxation here, because. she
is registered at Port Tqwnsend and never
plies, in the- waters of this State. Olson
resides in this city, . and the decision of
Judge Seawell rests upon that point ' .

In conclusion Patterson said that all
authorities upon international law and
the articles ' of civilized warfare declared
that the use of the enemy's uniform was
not warranted, and that a man in an
enemy's uniform who killed another man
was guilty of assassination and outside
the pale of protection. When Patterson
had concluded the. Senate at 4' o'cUJcic
went into* executive session and soon aft
erward adjourned until Monday.
Patterson then read at length the pro
visions of warfare relating to spies and
the use of deception, and read extensively
from General Funston's magazine article,
his point being that General Funston had
violated the articles of warfare in deceiv
ing the Filipinos at the time he captured
Aguinaldo, despite his statement now that
he had- not done so. 'Â¦, ,'
- Taking advantage of the latitude of de
bate afforded by the Senate rules. Patter
son of Colorado called attention to a dis
patch from Topeka, Kans., published .to
day in which General Frederick Funston
was represented as criticizing some East
ern papers because of their comment .on
hi3 recent speech before the Lotus Cluo
in New York. He said that he would not
notice the statement but /for the fact that
General Funston called to his aid thd
President and the chairman of the Senate
Committee on the Philippines, represent
ing them as indorsing his speech.
Patterson said it was evident that Gen
eral-Funston's speech was to be used foe
campaign purposes, and he thought there
fore that' two things out to be brought
calmly and dispassionately to the atten
tion of the country. First. General Kims
ton's own statement of the character of
Aguinaldo, made in a magazine article;
last October, and, second, the rules of
civilized warfare regarding deception oi
theenerriy. - . . . -
Quarles vigorously denounced the oleo
margarine industry as at present con
ducted* as a fraud, and insisted that in
the Interest not only of dairymen, but
also In the interest of the whote American
people, the pending bill ought to be en
acted into law. . .. t .
â¢ WASHINGTON, March. 27.-In the Sen
ate to-day Harris of Kansas and Quarlea
of Wisconsin spoke at length on the oleo
margarine bill. Harris supported" the
measure, but urged that an amendment
which he proposed, placing a tax of ;10
cents a' pound on. adujterat^a butter and
regulating: the manufacture and sale of
renovated butter, ought to be adopted.

. 'Anna Elizabeth, dearly beloved daughter of
; '.Pehr'andH Christine -Peterson. -"a native "of
San Francisco.: aged '8 months and* 14 days."I am told that about two-thirds of the
street railway employes of the city. have
affiliated with the union. The men are
not asking concessions in the matter- of
hours or wages, but they resent Mr. Vin
ing's Interference with their personal lib
erty in decreeing that. they shall not join
a union.. However, â¢ I hope to secure a
frank discussion of the situation by rep
resentatives of the employes and Mr.
Duane and Mr. Dellano â¢ of the Eastern
syndicate, with possibly Attorney General
Ford, their attorney."
General Manager Vining asserts that
the strength of the union Is greatly ex
aggerated. He says that of the 2000 em
ployes of the Market-street Railway Com
pany lines not more than a hundred have
joined, the union, and that a large num
ber of these are discharged employes. He
does not believe that one in ten of their
employes would be willing to strike to
remedy, any of their alleged grievances.
"Our men are paid- 22 cents per hour,"
Mr. Vining said. "They have the choice
of working ten or twelve hours. If an
employe wants to j earn $2 65 instead , of
$2 20 he works the extra hours. A day's
pay is drawn every day, payment being
about three days behind all the time. Five
years service entitles a man to an extra
cent per: hour, ten years' to 2 cents, fif
teen years' to 3 cents and twenty years' to
4 cents, this .bonus being paid monthly.
Tins pay Is the most liberal to be found
in any. city In the country except Butte,
Mont. We demand loyal service and con
sider Joining in the formation, of a union
to fight us an act of disloyalty. Of course
I cannot say. what view of the question
will be, taken by the new owners.',' ,
" Syndicate Not Yet in Charge. .
The new corporation, the United Rail
roads of San Francisco, has still little
more than a nominal existence, with Â¦ a
dummy board of Â¦ directors. Pending or
ganization of its : working force the ' old
Market Street Railway Company man
agement under Vining continues in
charge, operating the roads for the new
Resent Vining's j Interference.
"I saw Mr." Duane about a, month ago;
at the timo fourteen men had been dis
charged in ten days for having joined the
union. He seemed anxious that his cor
poration should' avoid conflict with its
employes, and he gave me the impression
that they would be willing to listen
to their grievances. . The dismissals
stopped for the, time, but I-am informed
by the committee- that-they began again
Friday and have continued with such
alarming frequency that a halt must be
called or they will, resort to a strike. Mr:
vining tells his men whom he discharges
that it is done because they have Joined
the union.. On the Sutter-street line they
do not assign a reason, and in some cases
they have even given the discharged men
excellent recommendations. .
â¢ A new labor trouble threatens,' and un
less the counsels of those who favor peace
is:heeded- San. Francisco is likely to be
plunged into a second disastrous -strike.
The street railroad employes of the cily',
lately organized" into a union, are de
manding'of the new syndicate. that they:
be let alone, free to declare their affilia
tion with the union. They have, appealed
to Mayor â¢Schmitz, to intercede for them
to stop dismissals of 'men for Joining the
union,- and .they declare that unless ' his
efforts are" successful they will tie up the
streetcar system of the. city. ..; >:'
; A committee of five from the new union,
accompanied by President Goff and. Sec
retary Kosenberg of the' San Francisco
Labor : Council, with? which the union is
affiliated, called upon Mayor Schmltz yes
terday morning- and informed him that
eight gripmen and conductors had been
discharged since. last Friday. Of these al
least. four were discharged by General
Manager Vining for- having joined; the
union. The managers of the Sutter-strcet
and SanMateo lines discharged the re
mainder, without assigning any reason at
all; the committee claims, the cause of
the trouble Â¦ being nothing else' than -the
union affiliations of the employes who lost
their jobs. The committee told the Mayor,
that 'unless the new owners would -give
him assurances that Vining and the other
managers of the lines acquired by " the
syndicate would be stopped In their cru
sade against the union they would be com
pelled to declare a strike and that quickly.
>?_â¢ Writes to Duane. â¢ ;
Mayor Schrnitz" at once addressed, a
communication to James M. Duane, rep
resenting, the Eastern owners, and asked
for a conference with him with the ob
lect, of arranging: a conference between
the new corporation and the employes.
The Mayor was informed last night that
Mr. Duane and his associates now in the
city would meet the representatives of
the employes at 10 o'clock this. morning
in the Mayor's office.
Mr. Duane asked to. be excused last
night 'from discussing the subject. He
would make no statement regarding the
Mayor's communication.
The committee from the union that
called upon the. Mayor consisted of Rich
ard Cornelius, . president of the union; W.
T. Jane, Andrew Sorenson, W. J. Gold
kuhl and' W. Burton. They had been ap
pointed to confer with the Labor Council
people and upon -the advice and with- the
support of the officers of that organiza
tion they decided to appeal to the Mayer.
"We cannot let" this matter become a
new labor conflict," Mayor Schmitz said
yesterday. "We do not want any strikes
in this city. As Mayor I shall do what
ever is , possible to. avert such troubles.
They hurt all i classes. I hope that we
shall be able to- settle all differences by
conferences or arbitration and avoid the
methods of warfare. Any strike is bad
enough, but a railroad strike is the worst
of all, and the constant danger, of- trouble
that may. end in loss of life, makes it a
conflict to be -avoided ,. if there - can â¢ be
found any possible peaceful method â¢â¢ of

Appointee Must Receive the Support
Â¦ Mayor Schmltz stated yesterday that he
will .veto,'. the resolution Â¦ adopted by the
Board/* â¢ of Supervisors confirming, the
nomination of George' S. McComb as
clerk of the Justices' Court. \ The Mayor
.said, that he would not take the "ten days
allowed him by the charter to act on the
resolution, but would send his veto to the
Board of Supervisors at. next Monday's
meeting.
The Mayor's reasons f^r taking unfav
orable action are . the 'same as those he
advanced when McComb's name was up
: for'. confirmation before the board. The
Mayor stated that he was opposed to the
appointment of a deposed deputy in Â¦ for
mer Clerk Williams' office to the position
of clerk. .Again, his Honor charged that
McComb haa often absented himself from
his duties ' when deputy clerk. This
charge McComb acknowledged to be
true, but pleaded in extenuation that he
always periormed the back work on the
next day. 'Â¦* .
It will . require Â¦ the votes " of fourteen
Supervisors to : override the Mayor's veto
of the resolution confirming McComb. The
appointment of McComb was ratified by
the votes of twelve . Supervisorsâ Alpers,
Bent, Boc-ih;- Braunhart, Comte, CurtiB,
D'Ancona, Eggers, Payot, Sanderson,
Brandenstein and - Wilson. The four
United Labor party members of the
board â Lynch, McClellan, Loughery and
Wynnâ together with Connor, the Demo
cratic member, voted against McCorab's
confirmation. Boxton, who was absent,
will vote with .the twelve Supervisors who
favored McComb, thus giving the latter
thirteen votes, or one less than the neces
sary fourteen. Unless Connor comes- to
his rescue McComb will not have enough
votes to pass the resolution over the
Mayor's head. He needs Connor, be
cause the Labor party members will not
vote for him. , â¢
On the other hand, the Justices of the
Peace contend that the Mayor has no
power either to sign or veto the resolu
tion. The Political Code provides sim
ply that the Supervisors shall confirm the
Justices' clerk j nomination. The I Justices
hold that the' confirmation could have
been made by motion instead of by reso
lution, which would have prevented the
Mayor rendering the. resolution nugatory
by refusing to affix his signature thereto.

The detectives at the central station are
looking, for two. crooks who robbed the
California candy factory at 1438 Market
street shortly after 6 o'clock last night.
The methods used by the thieves were
unique and the officers believe the per
petrators of the crime tobe strangers on
the coast and recent arrivals from, the
East.
While crowds were . passing to and iro
on the principal thoroughfare of the city,
the crooks worked. Â¦ One of them smeared
the glas3 in the large show window with
soap and then called the attention of the
proprietor to it. The latter at once se
cured water and a towel and .stepped out
side to clean the glass. "While thus occu
pied the second man entered the store and
looted the place. He opened the till and
cash register, taking all the money con
tained in them, about $55. A good descrip
tion of the men was given and their cap
ture is likely to be effected very soon.

Frank H. Short Believes the Matter
The oil rate cases were to have been
argued yesterday before Judge Morrow in
the United States Circuit Court, but At
torney Frank H. Short stated that he was
not ready to go on with the case and that
he would like a continuance of at least two
weeks. He added that he expected before
that time a settlement, of the is
sues Involved would be made out of court.
The complainants, the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Pacific
Railroad Company and the Southern Cali
fornia Railroad Company, seek to restrain
the Railroad Commissioners from enforcing
the new schedule of rates for transport
ing crude petroleum within the limits of
the State of California. They allege that
the rates if enforced would take away all
their profits and virtually amount to the
confiscation of the railroad property.
The answer of the Commissioners avers
that their schedule of .rates was adopted
after a careful and thorough investigation
Â¦of all,'the circumstances pertaining to or
surrounding the rates. They set Â¦ forth
also that the. railroads' claim of. sepa
rate ownership of the' lines is a sham and
that the lines are owned, controlled and
operated exclusively by the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe.
Judge Morrow set April 17 as the time
for 'hearing- the argument.

Shortly after this mishap an elevator on
the west side of the building hung flre be
tween the first and second floors. It was
too far up for the passengers to get out of
the lower floor and too far up for them to
make their exit through the upper one.
Not having any guarantee that they
might not have to stay there till the bars
were sawed away, they began to feel wor
ried. They all looked very unhappy 'and
did not appear to enjoy being in captiv
ity. Finally the cage stopped balking and
pursued the even tenor of Its way for the
rest of the day^ The elevator man said
the trouble was caused. by something fcr
which the engineer was responsible and
the engineer shifted the blame to the
elevator man.
The first accident occurred in. one of the
elevators on the east side of the build
ing. It was descending and was filled
with passengers by the time it had reach
ed the sixth floor. The operator lowered
it to the fifth floor, but when he at
tempted to stop it there something in
connection with the brake apparatus
snapped and the machine dropped like a
phot. The brake was still set and by
some unaccountable good fortune the ele
vator stopped with a shock at the fourth
floor. The passengers nearly broke the
door down getting out Every one care
fully inspected himself or herself and all
were overjoyed to find that they had
escaped unhurt. The machine was looked
over, and as it appeared to be all right,
it was kept in commission for the rest of
the day.
Passengers in two elevators in the Par
rott building were badly frightened yes
terday afternoon. Both cages were
crowded to the limit at the time. One of
them unexpectedly dropped about ten feet
and the other got stuck between two
floors. Considerable excitement was
aroused throughout the building, but it
gradually subsided when it was discovered
that no one was Injured to any extent.

GIVEN A SCARE
The United Ancient Order of Druids Is
called upon to mourn the loss of another
of its prominent members in the death
on last Wednesday of J. J. MolIIson, a
member of Hesperian Grove. In 1897-9S he
was the grand secretary of the order. He
was a native of England, 46 years of age.
and was deemed one of the best versed
men in the order on Druidic law and
work under the ritual. He was also a
member of Sotoyome Grove of the Im
proved Order of Red Men. His funeral
will be held under the auspices of the
: grove of Druids of which he was a mem-
I fcer.
Ex-Grand Secretary Dead.
In explanation C. C. Maxon claimed that
he had been-cruelly' deceived by a myth
ical person lh Los Angeles, who is known
as Halliday. Maxon returned the deed to
James and the deal is off. But the ques
tion now remains what is to become of
the heap of worthless truck / which is
stored in E.' Heringhi & Co.'s store? The
proprietors of the- store do not want it.
Jefferson / G. James has abjured it and
Real Estate Agent Duncan refuses to take
charge ' of - It. although ho spent several
hours yesterday surveying the motley,
hopeless heap of trash, dreaming of; his
shattered hopes of .fortune. V
If they were surprised when they saw
the. size of the load the truck contained
they were struck with consternation when
they beheld the contents of the boxes.
Never was such a mass of rubbish, such
odds and ends, collected together in one
mass. A hurried call was sent for James,
Duncan and Maxon, and together they
viewed the heap. Maxon offered no expla
nation as to why the handsome silks that
he had so -loudly lauded were but paper
dress patterns at least ten years. behind
the fashion, or why the fine hardware
was but a collection of old pots and pans
that had been burned out and cast away,
or why the drugs and patent medicines
was but a quantity of sweet oil. Â¦ .-. J :
There was one case missingâ that which
was supposed to contain the $14,000 worth
of notions, dry goods and piece goods
which had never been touched. -â¢ James
and Duncan pinned their hopes to this
â¢case and Maxon declared that when it ar
rived they would be satisfied with their
transaction. At the end of a day's wait
ing the missing article came to hand. Who
can judge of James* and Duncan's disap
pointment when the box was opened and
found to contain a quantity of valueless
pictures of .the Chicago World's Fair?
â¢ Claims He Was Deceived.
Boxes Contain Rubbish.
Millionaire James, however, was not to
let his acres slip through his fingers with
out taking some precaution, so he had the
deed placed in escrow â that Is, it was not
to be of value to Maxon unless the goods
were satisfactory when they arrived from
Los Angeles. This precaution on James'
part defeated Maxon's scheme- and turned
the whole attempt at fraud into a lu
dicrous farce. â¢ . â¢ "
After having the deed prepared . James
paid the storage on the goods in Los An
geles and also their freight to this city.
He also paid to have the records searched
In order to make certain that the title to
his land was clear. In order that he
might reap the greatest reward he made
arrangements to have the goods disposed
of by E. Heringhi & Co. The company
had space on the second -floor of "their
store cleared to receive the goods. Great
care was to be taken of the $39,000 worth
of precious commodities. The company
was to receive a commission for selling
the goods.
As the day for the arrival of the goods
drew near E. Heringhi and I. Belasco of
the company stood in the doorway of their
store watching to catch the first sight of
the trucks piled high with bales of the
precious silks and boxes of the priceless
works of art and they were grievously
disappointed when one single truck, with
but half a load of small, dirty boxes of all
shapes and sizes, arrived in front of their
door. 'J>'S$ . ' " ,

Seven hundred broad 'acres of choice,

nerciai transaction which was almost
consummated in this city within the last

The history of this strange and rather
udicrous deal involves- an account of the
sviles which were practiced by C. Ci
ttaxon, a suave young man from Los An
jeles, on Millionaire Jajnes and Real
tisate Agent Duncan, both of whom were
leslrous of making a few thousand dol
ars easily. Maxon, who is a handsome
y dressed man with a diamond of the
irst water sparkling from the Immaculate
bosom of hla shirt and two more gems
flittering from his cuffs, came to this city
iljout a month ago.
Launches His Scheme.
He sought the acquaintance of R.H.
Duncan and Informed him that he had
some personal property in L.os- Angeles,
valued at.*3Â»,000. which he wished to dis
pose of for some fertile land. Duncan,
anxious to reap a commission, sought to
assist Maxon in exchanging his property.
Duncan approached a number of wealthy
landowners in this city, but was unsuc
cessful in inducing- any one to bargain
with Maxon until he went to Jefferson Q.
'james' has a tract of land containing
700 acres in the vicinity of Monterey, ana
this, he was willing to sell. Maxon was
Introduced to James and the bargain pro
gressed swimmingly. Maxon showed
James a shipping receipt for the goods
stored In Los Angeles, and also a. com
plete invoice, in which the good3 were de
scribed at length. \ - â¢ '
The invoice showed that there was a
quantity of beautiful silk valued at 55000;
hardware, $18,000; lithographs, $1000, dry
coods, notions and piece goods, which had
never been touched, $14,000; 3000 pieces of
art work, imperial, manufacture, $1--j;
8 rugs and patent medicines, $4000; wild
cherry phosphate, $2000; embroidery work,
$500. These, with sundry other commodi
ties, made up a total value of $39,500. Â¦
Millionaire James did not place a value
higher than $20,000 on his land, and he
was perfectly willing to exchange it with
Maxon for goods amounting to almost
twice its value. He figured that even if
Maxon were exaggerating the value of the
goods he. could still hope to realize a
handsome profit. Real Estate Agent
Duncan dreamed night and day. of
the rich reward awaiting him. . ,
