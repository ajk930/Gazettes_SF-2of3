WASHINGTON. June IS.â
An Isthmian canal, whlla
not yet absolutely, as
eured, Is nearer to con
struction than It has ever
been. The Senate to-day
t>y a majority of eight votes adopted the
Bpooner substitute for the Hepburn Nica

stitute beirig i2 to 34. After two amend
ments to the measure had been made, one
providing for a commission to supervise,
the construction of the canal and the
other providing for the Issuance of $130,-

money with which to construct the water-

Clark of Montana addressed the Senate
In eupport of the Nicaragua canal route.
He thought if one half the objections to
both the Nicaragua and Panama routes
were valid, neither route would be adop
ted. However, he was satisfied the con
sensus of conservative opinion in this
country was that a great isthmian water-

offered formally his amendment as a sub
stitute for the pending so-called Hepburn
Nicaragua canal bill.
STYLES PAITAHA A HOODOO.
Morgan of Alabama closed to-day's de
bate with an earnest appeal for the adop
tion of the Nicaragua route. He had been
preceded by Clark of Montana in support
of the Nicaragua route and Allison of
Iowa in support of the Spooner proposi
tion. Only minor amendments, except
ihose indicated, were adopted, all others
bcJng voted down.
votes of a majority of the Senate. The
Panama route was considered more de
rirable by the Senate than the Nicaragua
route. The only question left open is the
title to the property," end that the Pres
ident will determine If the House should
adopt tho Senate's amendments to Its bill..
Allison of Iowa explained why he should
vote for the Spooner substitute. Ho be
lieved there was a general desire among
the American people for an isthmian
canal, and the people desired, too, that
the United States Government should
construct and control the canal.
He pointed out that the eyes of the
American people had been directed partic
ularly toward the Nicaragua route be
cause it was supposed that as a French
company had the concessions for the Pan
ama route the United States was barred
from that route.
Allison said it was proposed now to build
ALLISON'S ARGUMENT.
Clark declared that the Panama _ canal
scheme was a hoodoo which ought to be
shunned and avoided. He said the Pan
ama canal scheme had left a heritage of
ruin, disaster and desolation.
The difficultiesof constructing the canal
he believed were exaggerated. He thought
that the Nicaragua route was more to
be preferred, as it was, in his opinion,
more feasible and practicable than the
Panama route.
way should be constructed. The American
people, he said, were not to be deterred.
"You may delay the project," said he,
"but it cannot be defeated."
Spooner perfected his amendment, the
changes made being principally verbal.
The amendment, providing for the appoint
ment of an Isthmian Canal Commission to
direct the construction of the canal and
providing that seven members from the
committee shall receive such compensa
tion as the President shall prescribe, tin-
PERFECTS AMENDMENT.
"Just one word in parting with this
question. This duty was assigned to me
by the Senate and was not sought by me.
If we are to be beaten down here to-day!
and America Is to be disgraced, I shall
have had the honor, and the American
people will give it to me after I am dead,
of having devoted honestly and sincerely
the best labors of my life to the success
of our project." ,
Morgan urged Congress to determine the
question of route and not cowardly refer
the matter to the President. In conclu
sion he said:
Morgan particularly denounced the Pan
ama canal route as a "place where labor
and death Join hands." He said he had
been trying to protect the United States
from the shame of intercourse with it
Those who wanted to "touch that thing"
might do so. He would not do it, he de
clared, for both canals.
Morgan, chairman of the Interoceanlc
Canal Committee, at the conclusion of Al
lison's remarks, began his speech closing*
the debate. He said the canal Issue seem
ed to have come down to a single point
-that of finance. On point he de
ferred to Allison, but he did not believe
with him that it would be necessary to
issue bonds to pay for the construction of
a canal.
MORGAN'S FINAL APPEAL.
a canal forty-five feet deep and wide
enough and with a volume of water suf
ficient to float the largest ship ( afloat. The
minimum expenditurefor the construction
of the canal, he believed, would be more
than $200,000,000. -To meet this enormous
expenditure, he, favored the borrowing of
the money, making proper provision for
liquidating the principaAand Interest of
the bonds.
NEWARK. N. J.,. June 19.â Governor
Murphy at midnight ordered a part of the
Firet Regiment of Infantry and the entire
troop of First Troop O, Cavalry, to Pater
son to preserve peace. . The Erie Railroad
has been ordered to send trains here at
once.- -The members of both commands
began to assemble at 1 a. m. The troops
will be put on guard duty at the mills be
fore they open at 7 o'clock this morning.
PATERSON, N. J., June 20.â A delega
tion representing the mill owners called
on the Mayor last night and demanded
protection. The Mayor replied that the
police force was too' small and would be
overridden by a mob' of any size; that it
was Impossible to concentrate any. great
number of men at any point, and that a
terse portion of the- deputy sheriffs were
green hands and unreliable. It was point
ed out that < the millfrands were afraid to
wuvk and were In momentary fear of at
tr.ck. This resulted -in an appeal to the
Governor, who was in Newark, for troops,
and the consequent action. ;
. NEW YORK, June 19.'â Evidence was
procured to-day that. the rioting in Pater
son and disturbances elsewhere were the
result of an anarchist plot. The strike'of
the silk workers' was "apparently taken
out of the hands of the strikers and used
by. the anarchists as'an excuse for an at
tack on the authorities. Patersbnjs de
termined to stamp qut the nest of anar
cliisis that has found lodgment in the'
city. Mayor Hincijcliffe. said the limit;
had been -reached -p'ul the Â¦Â¦ leaders Jot; tha
sfouV>~Tv*OulB .; tituited * out '.' Of" tlic r'cityY
There j was 'talk "to-night J of forming aS
vigilance committee to maintain order.
Every silk mill was a fort" filled with
armed deputies. . Meetings of the anar
chlsta were dispersed by the police, "and
ten prisoners were taken during the day.
As a result of mob violence the cause of
the strikers seems to have .been lost,
though the anarchist element is defiant.
SILK MILLS CLOSE.
- The silk' mills throughout Hudson Coun
ty were closed indefinitely to-day by their
mannagers, to avoid disorder. Several
policemen were injured and a score of
locked-out operatives had their heads
broken in a riot at Union Hill, near to
Paterson, the chief cenjer of the silk In
dustry in this country, this afternoon. All
but one of the mills there were closed
down this morning by their owners, who
merely, anticipated a demand on the part
of their employes that they cease opera
tions in sympathy with the Paterson
strikers. / More than one thousand man
and women made a demonstration against
the mill of R. & H. Simon, which re
mained In operation, but were driven
back and dispersed after a bitter fight,
chiefly through the work done by firemen
in turning their hose on the mob. Trouble
of even more serious character will, it is
feared, take "place there to-morrow.
LEADERS IN HIDING.,
PATERSQN, N. J.. June 19.â In the
main this was a quiet day in this city.
The most important event was the sus
pension from duty of Chief of Police Fred
C. Graul by Mayor Hinchcliffe and the
assumption by the Mayor of the duties
of that position. "William McQueen, the
Englishman who was prominent at yes
terday's meeting before the rioting be
gan, has left the city and is believed to
be jn New York. Galleano, the Italian and
Grossman, the German, who are said to
have been prominent yesterday, have also
kept from public notice. Mayor Hinch
cliffe wishes to interview all these men.
Lacking a leader and keeping out of the
heavy rain In the early day, the rioters
of yesterday did nothing when a majority
of the mills they closed yesterday by their
violence resumed work.
The police received orders to shoot
straight if they should have another en
counter with the rioters, and the Mayor
has had copies of the riot act distributed.
This week's edition of La Questlone So
ciale, one of the anarchist papers, was
set up here but was sent to a iPassaic
printer, to run off the forms. Ho was
ordered not to han-dle It and complied.
ITALIANS ARE DISPERSED.
About 400 Italian strikers and others
gathered in the quarter of the city where
the larger part of the Italian colony
lives and started to march to Turner
Hall, only a block from po'lice headquar
ters. It is said that the proposed meet
ing there to-day was arranged for at a
meeting of ' anarchists last night. The
procession had barely got Â¦ under way
when the reserves charged the paraders.
There was a quick scattering in ali direc
tions. . .
Harry- Harris, the reporter who was
knocked down, beaten and nitally shot
with his own. revolver by the mob, was
very, low to-day, but hope of his recov
ery Is still entertained.

held at Santa Cruz from June '23
to 23. In every county from San Diego
to Shasta the greatest activity and en
thusiasm are being shown by the En
df avorers.
There will be about 300 delegates from
Southern California. They will go to th<?
scene of the convention on a special
train. Ssfnta Clara and Golden Gate un
ions are making special efforts to sur
pass Alameda County In the number of
delegates, Cut from latest indications
Alameda County is likely to retain first
place. , Last year at Santa Ana Alameda
County registered over 100.
The programme shows that a larger
number of speakers have been secured
than at any previous convention, and the
proceedings will continue one day longer
than usual. The committee on arrange
ments has decided that the sessions shall
be held mornings and evenings, bo as to
allow the afternoons to be -devoted to
special meetings and trips to various
point3 of interest, an itinerary for v/hich
has already been made.
The San Diego Chamber of Commerce
has decided to send Miss Bello Sumner
Angier as a representative to secure the
convention for 1903. Ml6s Angier is a
most capable worker, hence th-i honor
conferred upon her.
Owing to the support promised the San
Diego delegation, the Santa Rosa En
deavorers have about decided to make
their plans for 1904,
The railroad tickets for the convention
at Santa Cruz are now on sale at all
points, and delegates and visitors must
obtain a receipt from the ticket agent
when purchasing, their tickets, which
when signed by the secretary of the con
vention will entitle the holder to a return

FRESNO. June 19.â The general confer
ence' of the California Epworth League
of the Methodist Episcopal Church South
met in regular session in this city this
morning with an attendance of about 100
delegates, and commenced Â¦what-promlses
to be one of the most profitable and en
tertaining sessions ever held in the State.
At 10 o'clock was commenced the business
session, State President Caldwell of Lom
poc presiding. At 11 o'clock the first ser
mon of the convention .was given by the
Rev. Guyton Fisher of West End,; Los
Anjreles, who spoke upon *?The Qreater
Miracle." The afternoon session opened
with a song service led by Professor J.
A. Carroll of Tennessee. ..-,.Â¦
The first pap.er was by Dr. M. B. Chap
man of Los Angeles, who iÂ§ to conduct a
series of lectures on "Bible Study" during
the convention. His paper this afternoon
was on the subject of "The History, In
spiration and General Structure of the
Bible," and was very interesting through--

Black refuses to talk of his predicament
Y^terday nearly all 'afternoon he. and
Attorney W. H. Schooler were in consul
tation and by the latter^ advice Black
maintained silence. ;:.Â¦"â¢
Black has a wardrobe that points to the
budding swell. In his room were found
a dress suit, a Tuxedo, five business suits
half a dozen pairs of patent leather shoes'
cravat*, ties, fine underweaV and silk
night shirts to please the most fastidious
of dandies. He had much automobile
literature and a matrimonial paper in a
grip. Evidently. Black had social ambii.
tions. V â¢
In Denver Black was a guest at the
Brown Palace, registered as R, M. Jones.
A telegram to that name and address, un
der date of May 23, was found among his
papers. It is is from Omafca, and reads:
"Arrived home OK. Mother very sick.
Letter follows. Â¦'Â¦ ALICE."
Black reached San Francisco May 31,
evidently coming direct from Salt Lake
where on May 29 as R. I. Smith he had
deposited in bank $500. So far as is known
his operations in California had only just
begun and his dupes here are not numer
ous. Chief of Police Wittman and Cap
tain of Detectives Martin are receiving
many congratulations over the capture of
this man, whose clever operations have
baffled the detectives of so many cities. -
Besides the evidence already noted as
found in Black's room, there were check
books and loose blank checks of scores of
banks all over the country. A written
sheet contained the names of cashiers of
a large number, of banks. A typewritten
sheet contained names of cities and towns
in thirty-seven States.
\P~ M. Jones, Denver National Bank,
May 14, $500; Hoffman & Co., Indiana Na
tional Bank, $1000, April 29; G. A. Wash

National Bank of the Republic, Salt Lake
City, May 29, $500; R. M. Jones, Denver
National Bank, May 14 to 19. $3000.
How many of these were cash deposits
and how many deposits of fictitious
checks and drafts is not yet known.
Black's westward course and his Increas
ing prosperity Is shown by this unique
record. His use, in making deposits, of
the names of Stone, Jones, Davis,
Steuben, etc., the names of the payees of
fictitious Karl Company checks, helps to
fasten those crimes upon him.
Black had a deposit of $500 with the
First National Bank of San Jose. His
other bank books showed accounts and
aliases as follows :
Black's Bank of California account, un
der the name of G. W. Pratt, was opened
June 5 by the deposit of $1000 in cash. The
deposit of drafts and checks amounting
to $1435 followed, and June 13 he drew out
$940. The bank is still $60 to the good.
Black evidently was laying the founda
tion of a credit that would make the
passing of fictitious paper possible.
The Western National Bank account,
under the name of Black & Co., led to
the swindler's arrest. June 11 he depos
ited a draft on a New York bank for
$1100, June 12 a check on the Citizens'
Bank of Santa Clara for $800 and on June
13 one for $167 50 on the same bank. Both
the latter were signed "G. A. Groves" in
a handwriting that resembles signatures
found among Black's papers. Black Â¦ got
$35 from the Western National Bank, but
when he tried to draw out by check $2000
more and the Santa Clara paper came
back marked "no funds" Black's arrest
in the Palace Hotel court Monday night
by Detectives McMahon and Whitaker
followed. â¢
Black had opened accounts, with the
Union National Bank of Oakland, depos
iting $500 in <ash June 9 under the name
of A. Young. June 12 he deposited a draft
for $1000 on the Indiana National Bank of
Indianapolis in favor of "J. B. Washing
ton." June IS he drew a check for $6oO
against the Oakland bank account in
favor of "G. W. Pratt," indorsed it in
that name and deposited it with the
Bank of California, where "G. W. Pratt"
had an account. The Oakland bank hon
ored the check and is out $100.
Thirteen -bank books showing deposits*'
from $35 to 'several thousands were among
Black's effects. The names' of the de
positors, again, were Black's aliases;
connect Black in some instances directly
with the hotel frauds. - .-.â¢â¢â¢/
These checks were signed "M. D. Earl"
for the "Earl Fruit and Produce Com
pany," a corporation that does not exist.
They were made payable to the order of
various . persons. These fictitious, names,"
presumably Black's aliases, included Her

blank forms of the National Hotel Keep
ers* Protective Association's credit letter
found in his room, and with them the zinc
plate, made by a Milwaukee engraving
company, from which the forms were
printed.
During the early weeks in 'April scores
of Eastern and Juiddle West hotels were
defrauded by means of bogus credit let
ters. Nearly all accredited the bearer as
connected with the "Earl Fruit and Pro
duce Company" of California. A dozen
different names were used for the bearer,
though it is believed that Black was the
operator in every case. The evidence
found to-day shows that Black alone or
Black and his associates forged the credit
letters at once upon, the receipt of the
genuine letter late in March and began
operations promptly.
Most of the "Earl Fruit and Produce
Company" checks were drawn on the
First National Bank of San Jose and the
American Bank and Trust Company of
San Francisco. Pinkerton reports to the
Polices' Department show twenty-three of
these bogus checks to have been already
received by; San Francisco banks and pro
tested by them.

Â¦ Ten years ago two prospectors, Rice and
MacKenzie, started on a trip through the
Whitewater, district, which lies between
ICaslo and Sandon, in the vicinity of Bear
Lake. The two gold hunters discovered a
quantity of rich float quartz, which was
well honeycombed, and which, according to
their calculations, assayed as high as $900
a ton. They followed the float and were
successful in locating an extremely rich
ledg-e of free milling ore on the side of the
bluff. It was the find of a lifetime and
the men realized its importance. Sample's
were taken to the camp and assayed from
$?00 to $1508 to the ton.
The men registered their claim and went
to Rossland to exploit it. Shortly after
the two miners became entangled in an
affair touching the violent death of a
woman. Rice fled from the country and
MacKenzie returned to the Whitewater
camp next year, but could never find the
rich ledge, which promised fortune to so
many people. Last fall he died and the
search was taken up by other parties.
A week a^o another miner, a stranger in
the regicn. found the ledge, marked with
the old stakes of ten years ago, and to
day returns were obtained of over $1000 a
ton. The property is now owned by G.
JlacQuillan, Consul for Ecuador.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 19.â The dis
covery of a. marvelously rich gold ledge
in the Whitewater district, which had
been lost for ten years, is being exploited
by Jfootenay mining men. The story tjf
the criginal location of the mine, how it
first was lost and how .after i years of
search it was rediscovered almost by acci
dent Teads like a mining romance of the
sixties. .....

The. steamer White tlorse was released
from Quarantine at Dog Island yester
day. No new cases of smallpox have de
veloped anywhere in the territory and
the authorities have taken the most
stringent measures to prevent any fur
ther importations.
. Work on the government wagon road
between this citv and White Horse will
be commenced on Monday next.
A great deal of summer labor is being
done on bench and creek claims, the min
ers engaged in such work taking out goli
as they go along. The excellent results
attained t-.o far by sluicing operations
have had the effect of stirring up trade
in this city and the merchants are par
ticipating in more business now than they
ever had at corresponding periods of for
mer seasons.
DAWSON, June 19.â The clean-up in the
creeks is proceeding with a rush as recent
rains have given the miners full heads
of water in the sluices. Every man is
taking advantage of the" high water with
the result that gold is literally pouring
into the banks. The Canadian Bank of
Commerce alone has shipped to the out
side so far --this season over $1,000,000
worth of gold. The best estimate of th-3
clean-up places the ligure at $27,000,000 to

Crush Manufacturers, G09 Sacramento StMANAGUA. Nicaragua, June 19.^ â All the
roads between Corinto, on the Pacific, and
Grai.-adu. on Lake Nicaragua, have been' com
pl'ted.
"While the Embassador admits that thÂ»
jails in Italy are not as sanitary as the
ones in the United States, he expresses
the opinion that If an offense was com
mitted against the local municipal laws,
the offenders should suffer the custom
ary local punishment.
The publication of the text of the dis
approval from London has undoubtedly
embarrassed this Government, arid Rear
Admiral Crownlnshield will â¢ probably be
asked to explain how the matter became
public. It was rumored that a cable has
a:ready been sent to Crowninshield re
questing this Information, but it lacks
confirmation. The Secretary carried away
from the Navy Department this evening
a voluminous manuscript containing the
record of the court. He has not made up
his mind whether cr not he -will make it
public:
Rumors are current to-night that Cap
tain Dayton of the Chicago, president ot
the court of inquiry, will request a court
of inquiry on his conduct during the trou
ble. This would be a direct result of
Crowninshield's sharp criticism of Dayton
for his failure to make representations
in behalf of the imprisoned officers.
Chicago court of 'inquiry was concluded.
These officials felt that It would be best
to allow the incident to drop out of sight,
therefore It was agreed by Secretary Hay
that the report of the proceedings of the
court of inquiry should not be published,
while the Embassador agreed that noth
ing should be made public in Italy bear
ing on the proceedings of the civil court
before which the American officers were
convicted. The Embassador says that the
record of the civil court, a copy of which
he showed to Acting Secretary Hill to
day, contains the sworn statement of
many witnesses that the officers were in
toxicated and provoked trouble in the
cafe. Now that the text of Admiral
Crowninshield's comment has been pub
lished, the Italian government is likely to
retaliate by publishing the record of the
civil court to show that the trial v/as fair,
and by furnishing evidence to show that
the officers were not subjected to "revolt
ing indignities." The Italian authorities
have received letters from the United
States Consul at Venice expressing satis
faction with the manner in which the of
ficers were treated.
practically extinct, were quite numerous, and
Northern Democratic Governors, now almost
never seen, were frequently encountered.
If this state of impairment exists, an instant
duty presses upon the managers of the Demo
cratic establishment; and one which they can
not evade with honor. Those of us less prom
inent In the party-'-the rank and file â are long-
Ing- to be led through old Democratic ways to
old Democratic victories. We were never more
ready to do enthusiastic battle than now. If
we can only be marshaled outaide the shadow
of predestined defeat. Is it too much to ask
our leaders to avoid paths that are known to
lead to disaster; is it too much to ask that
proven errors be abandoned, and that we be
delivered from a body of death, and relieved
from the burden of Issues which have been kill
ed by the decrees of the American people?
Ought not we to be fed upon something better
than the husks of defeat?. If these questions
are met in an honest manly fashion, I believe
it will be productive of the best kind of Demo
cratic harmony.
In dealing with new Issues we of the Demo
cratic faith are fortunate in the simplicity of
Democratic standards and the ease with which
new questions can be measured by those stan
dards. A party based upon care for the inter
ests of all the people, as their aggregate con
dition demands, with no unjust favoritism for
any particular class; a party devoted to the
plan of popular government as our fathers
ordained It and for the purposes which they
sought to establish: a party whose conservatism
opposes dangerous and un-American experi
ments and yet puts nÂ«- barrier In the way of
frenulne and safe progress, ought to be able to
deal with new conditions In a manner quite
consistent with Democratic doctrine, and stim
ulating to Democratic pulses and instincts.
NO GAUDY ISSUES.
Let us not forget, however, that it is not in
the search of new and gaudy issues, nor the
interpretation of strange visions that a strong
and healthy Democracy displays its splendid
power. Another party may thrive on the ever
shifting treatment of the ever-shifting moods
of popular restlessness, or by an insincere play
upon unreasoning prejudice and selfish antici
pation â but the Democratic party never. Demo
cracy has already in etore the doctrines for
which It fights its successful battles, and it will
have them in store as long as the people, are
kept from their own. and just as long as their
rights and Interests are sacrificed, by favoritism
In government care, by Inequality of govern
ment burdens, by the encouragement of huge
Industrial aggregations that throttle Individual
enterprise, by the reckless waste of public
money, and by the greatest of all injuries as it
underlies nearly all others, a system of tariff
taxation whose .robbing exactions are far be
yond the needs of economical and legitimate
government expenditure, which purchases sup
port by appeals to sordldness and greed, which
continually corrupts the public conscience.
What but infatuation with the visage of de
feat can explain the subordination of these
things by Democrats when they prepare for
battle? If we are to have a rehabilitation and
a realignment of our party in the sense sug
gested. It Is Important that it be done openly,
and with no mystery or double meaning. Our
people are too much on the alert to accept poli
tical deliverances they do not understand, and
the enthusiasm of the Democratic rank and file
does not thrive on mystery-
DEMOCRATIC HABJIONY.
The Democratic harmony of which we hear
so much cannot be effectively constructed by
mathematical rule, nor by a formal agreement
on the part of those who have been divided,
that there shall be harmony. It grows up natu
rally when true Democratic principles are
plainly announced, when Democratic purposes
are honestly declared, when as a result of
those, care and enthusiasm stir the Democratic
blood. It was such harmony as -this, growing
out of such conditions, which with the battle
cry of "Tilden and Reform" gave us the
Democratic victory of 1876 against odds great
enough to discourage any but a harmonious
Democracy and against an opposing- force
brazen and desperate enough to take from us
by downright robbery what the voters of the
land gave to us.
-I believe the times point to another Demo
cratic opportunity as now at hand, but I be
lieve we shall reap the fruits of It only by
following the line of conduct I have Indicated.
In any event. I have a comforting and abiding
faith In the indestructibility of the party
which has so many times shown Its rleht to
live and its power for good, and I am sure the
reserve of patriotic Democratic wisdom will at
the same time declare itself in the rescue of
our country and of our party.
My days of political activity are past and I
shall not hereafter assume to participate in
party councils. I am absolutely content with
retirement, but I still have one burning, anx
ious political aspiration. I want to see before
I die the restoration to perfect health and
supremacy of that Democracy whose mission
It Is to bless the people â a Democracy true to
ltsslf, untempted by clamor, unmoved by the
gusts of popular passion and uncorrupted by
offers of strange alliance â the Democracy of
patriotism, the Democracy of safety, the Dem
ocracy of Tilden and the Democracy that de
serves and wlnn success.
At the point in his speech where Cleve
land announced his absolute retirement
from politics the crowd yelled, "No, no,
no.."
Ex-Senator -David B. Hill, who spoke
next, was received almost as enthusias
tically as Cleveland. Dowiing 'in intro
ducing him said:
"Mr. Hill is to-day the recognized lead
er of his party in New York State, and
under his guidance and leadership we
are confident of victory."
SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
Hill said In part:
The signs of the times point unmistakably to
an awakened interest in the promotion of suc
cess of Democratic principles of government.
These manifestations, however, are not con
fined within strict party lines, but â¢ renewed
activity in political affairs is displayed as well
among those of independent proclivities and
among the people generally who are not satis
fied with existing political conditions and de
sire a chance of the public policies now pre
vailing. There is especially a deep conviction
among thoughtful people that there is some
thing radically wrong in the foreign policy of
the present administration.
Hill here referred to the recent speech
of Mr. Hoar in the Senate upon the Phil
ippine question, and said that it Â¦ had
made a profound and lasting impression
upon the heart and conscience of the
country. Hill continued:
This great and patriotic speech was not met
or enswered by the partisan address of Presi
dent Roosevelt, delivered on Decoration day
in violation of the proprieties of the occasion,
wherein he purposely or inadvertently confused
the well-recognized distinctions which exist
between the administration and the Govern
ment â between the army and the Government,
and between all the other officials of the Gov
ernment and the Government itself; and
assumed to question the loyalty of . those
who have ventured to criticize the
cruel acts of a few officers of the army,
Â¦Â«tho. If semi-official reports are correct, have
undoubtedly disgraced the uniform which they
wear. This confusion of the state itself with
the ruler thereof is not new in history. It
was LjOuIs XIV who once made the same mis
take when he assumed to be France and uttered
the famous declaration: "I am the state,"
a remark which might have lost him his head
in later times of less despotism; and President
Roosevelt in another sense seems to have al
ready lost his head when he forgets that this
country differs from both ancient and modern
France in that here It is not a crime to criti
cize the army or the President* or any other
servant or servants of the people, and he
needs to be reminded that it. is a government
of law; a government under a written consti
tution, wherein the right of every citizen to
freely express his sentiments upon administra
tive questions is expressly guaranteed â and
that loyalty to the Government does not con
sist in loyalty to individuals or to the policies
of those who happen to hold official positions.
ARRAIGNS ADMINISTRATION
I^oyalty to this Government consists In at
tachment to our free institutions â In the faith
ful observance of constitutional provisions â In
respect for its flag as the emblem of civil lib
erty â in support of the authorities of the
United States against the attacks of our for
eign or domestic foes; but it does not con
sist in ostentatious professions of "Intense
Americanism" nor indifference to the preserva
tion or spread of republican forms of Govern
ment anywhere, nor in suppressing free speech
nor in conquering the free people of any and
distant lands, who desire to govern themselves
nor in unlawfully sending accredited repre
sentatives of this Government abroad without
the consent of the Senate, to witness the coro
nation of a King whose monarchical govern
ment, to its shame be It said, has just suc
ceeded in crushing" the two struggling repub
lics of South Africa. And right here I may
tx: permitted to suggest that the administra
tion of President Roosevelt will be . particularly
noted as the one during the existence of which
the republics of those brave and gallant peo
ple were destroyed â destroyed without cne
word of protest or one effort to save them or
one kind word of sympathy for them In their
unequal struggle, expressed on the part of this
â the greatest republic of the world â whose
influence should always be exerted on the side
of free institutions. . Â¦
In" contrast with that supine attitude we
NEW YORK, June 19.â Democratic
unity was the keynote to-night
of a great gathering of repre
sentative Democrats, who had
come to attend -fle opening of
the handsome new quarters of the Tllaen
Club. Addresses were made by prominent
Democrats and afterward a collation was
served in the banquet hall to the distin
guished quests of the evening and a buffet
supper served in the basement for the
ranK and file.
To Democrats the event was one of the
most memorable for many a day, as
Grover Cleveland and David B. Hill met
in harmony, seeking to draw the factions
of their party together. It was the first
public political appearance of the ex-
President in live years and his first meet-
Ing with Hill in eix years.
William J. Bryan had been invited to
attend, but not to speak, but no reply
va.s received Irom. him.
CLEVELAND'S SPEECH.
Cleveland arrived at the clubhouse, ac
companied by H. D. Hotchklss, Dr. Jo
seph i). Bryant and John C. Cainoun. tie
had scarcely got into the building when
ex-Senator xJavid B. riiil, accompanied by
1-^rtiin Kellogg, came in. Mill's eye
ca.uijnt Cleveland as soon as he had en
tereii the spacious club foyer and a. mo
ment later they were cordially shaking
each otner's hand.
Loud and prolonged applause greeted
the two men as they entered the assembly
room. President Dowiing of the club soon
began to speak and in introducing ex-
Prtsident Cleveland said:
"We have with us here to-night the
greatest of living Democrats. The first
speaker I have tne honor ot introducing
to you is the successful candidate of two
national campaigns, ex-President Grover
Cleveland."
There was tremendous applause as
Cleveland ascended the small platform.
This applause wound up with three cheers
and a -tiger." When quiet was restored
the former President began speaking. He
said:
I have been urced to participate In thli oc
casion by those who have assured me that this
hancUom* structure is to be dedicated to-night
by the rehabilitation and the reconstruction of
the Ltemocratic party under the inspiration of
a ncine which, during the days of Democratic
btrengtii and achievement, was honored by ev
ery Democratic household. Such an assurance
made to one who toilowed with hearty devotion,
the leadership ot Samuel J. Tilden when living,
ar.d who has since found in his career and
fame the hishest incentive to Democratic
steadfastness, could hardly fail to overcome
the temptation of my contented retirement from
jjoliiical activity. Perhaps there are those who
would deline my position as one of banishment
instead of retirement. Against this I shall not
enter a protest. It is sufficient for me in
either case that I have followed in matters of
difference within our party the teachings and
counsel of the great Democrat in whose name
party peace and harmony are to-night invoked.
No ccmresslon of party Bin should therefore be
expected. I have none to make; nor do I
crav e political absolution. I am here to take
counsel with others professing the same party
laith concerning the Democratic situation. I
suppose we all are convinced that this situation
might be Improved; and come of us may think
it is perilously undermined. Whatever the
measure of its impairment may be, our condi
tion as an organization cannot be improved
by calling each other harsh names, nor by in
augurating a system of arbitrary proscription
and banishment. The members of a business
/firm In financial embarrassment should not sit
down and look In each other's face !n mute
despair, neither will they regain financial
soundness , or the confidence of the business
community br recrimination aad quarrel; nor
will any members of the firm aid in its restor
ation to solvent strength by an angry Insis
tence â¢upon a continuation of the business meth
ods which have invited its embarrassment.
HOT YET INSOLVENT.
The Democratic party is very far from po
litical Insolvency, but no one here should be
offended by the Euggeftion that Its capital and
prospects have suffered serious injury since Mr.
Tilden was elected President. Then and after
ward Northern Democratic States were not rare
curiosities; Northern Democratic Senators, now
CALL BUREAU. 14C6 G STREET.N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 19.â
Italy has taken umbrage at \ the
statement made in the published
disapproval - by Rear Admiral
Crowinshield of the findings of the court
of inquiry in .which he said that the offi
cers of the Chicago arrested in Venice
suffered "revolting indignities" while im
prisoned. Signor Mayor des Planches, the
Italian Embassador, called at the State
Department to-day and requested an ex
planation of the publication. He declares
that his government will in self-defense
probably publish the record of the trial
in order to show that the officers were at
fault. Signor des Planches talked with
Dr. D. J. Hill, acting Secretary of State,
and Secretary Moody, who assured him
that the publication had been made with
out authority from the Government. The
Embassador has cabled the facts to his
government, and is awaiting advices. It
is feared the matter may take a more
serious turn on account of the apparent
violation by the United States of its side
of an agreement which the Embassador
made with Secretary Hay soon after the
Special Dispatch to The Call.
....Jones of Virginia, the ranking member
of the minority Of the eommitte made
an able presentation of the Democratic
position, but he yielded the floor after
speaking about an hour and will resume
to-morrow morning. These were the only
speeches made to-day.
WASHINGTON, June 19.â The opening
day of the week's debate on the Philip
pine bill in the House was signalized by
a remarkably strong and exhaustive
speech by Cooper of Wisconsin, chairman
of the Committee on Insular Affairs. He
spoke for almost three hours and was
given close attention by both sides of the
House. . Much of the speech was a gen
eral defense of the policy pursued by the
administration and drew repeated ap
plause from his* side of the House. He
contended that the problem of the Philip
pines should not be a party question; that
both political parties brought on the war
with Spain and the -votes off members of
both parties ratified the treaty which
made the islands American territory. The
most telling portion of his bill was the
parallel he drew between the present atti
tude of the opposition and the attitude
of the opposition during and immediately
succeeding the Civil War.
We all adhere to that doctrine declared by
Jefferson as follows: "Peace, commerce and
We are all in favor of the constitutional re
form involved in the election of United States
Senators by the people rather than by State
Lejrlflatures.
We all recognize the dignity of labor and Its
right to demand Just and adequate compensa
tion. We are all opposed to an immense stand
ing armv In times of peace.
We all stand for free trade in all articles con
trolled by thn trusts. We all desire Justice for
Cuba and Justice to the consumers of the Unit
ed States also. We fi.ll stand where Jackson
Benton and Tllden stood â In favor of hard
money as opposed to an irredeemable paper
currency. ;
We all concur in the principle that taxation
should be Imposed lor public purposes only.
We all favor freedom of commerce, and there
fore favor genuine reciprocity with foreign na
tions, but are all opposed to sham Republican
reciprocity, which is only another . name for
Republican hypocrisy. There is no division in
sentiment in our opposition to corporate com
binations of capital which create monopolies,
stifle competition and unreasonably enhance
prices for the necessaries of life. â¢
There is substantial accord among the Dem
ocrats or the country upon the timely Issues
which are now engrossing public attention. We
are all united In l'avor of the preservation of
constitutional liberty wherever our flag floats.
We are opposed as the permanent policy of the
Government to the maintenance of dependent
colonies to be governed outside the pale of the
constitution. We are all agreed that the civil
should always be superior to the military
power.
ON DEMOCRATIC UNITY.
That there has existed for some time a poyu
lar sentiment demanding reliet in some lorm
ironi the*e exactions ia quite apparent. Acting
upon the assumption that the trusts, should be
prosecuted by tneir friends and not their ene
'mies, the national administration has at last
constrained Itself to institute some civil suits
to test the etficacy of the Sherman act. What
has been the net result? A few temporary in
Junctions have been obtained, with the tacit
consent of the trusts themselves, or at least
with little or no opposition, which in general
terms restrain the trusts^ irom violating th-Â«
Sherman act (which they 'Â¦ expressly deny they
have violated or are now violating) and little
or nothing- else has been accomplished and thÂ»
courts will soon adjourn for the summer: the
business is continued and prices remain the
same. It is a sufficient commentary on thÂ°
whole proceeding: to say that no criminal pros
ecution has been instituted; no arrest has been
made and no indictment found anywhere.
What the people want is immediately relief
from the present high prices extorted from
them. More relief can be obtained by the ap
plication of a speedy and effectual remedy in
the repeal of all tariff duties upon productions
controlled by the trustay It has unreasonably
increased public taxation for the benefit of pri
vate Interest and finally it has promoted dan
gerous speculation to an' extent which the bold
est business gambler never dreamed of where
by millions upon millions of worthless stocks
have been unloaded upon a deceived public, upon
the promise and expectation of dividends which
cannot be earned and can never be realized
creating an alleged prosperity, which must
necessarily be false and fictitious; and when
the bubble bursts â as ere' long it surely must
it will inevitably bring disaster to the business
community, and the public will have learned to
their sorrow that lesson of political economy
which teaches that people can never get rich
; by simply taxing themselves
Hill asserted that the logic of events
had demonstrated the soundness of many
Democratic contentions of recent years
He recited that portion of the Kansas
City platlorm which condemned the Ding
ley tariff law as a trust-breeder and said
that this measure had not only succeeded
In creating more trusts than ever before
Jn-the history of the country, but It has
also succeeded in stifling competition to a
greater extent than was ever known He
declared further that it had succeeded in
unnecessarily raising: the cost of living
and had caused more strikes on the part
of workingmen than at any period of our
history. He added:
ALLEGED TRUST BREEDER.
Neither are we Insensible to the appeals of
Cuba for relief from the tariff exactions Im
posed by the Republican party. We were the
friends of Cuba when she was suffering from
Spanish oppression and when a Republican ad
ministration was reluctant to interfere in its
behalf. We are the true friends of Cuba to
day and we are prepared to mete out to her
not merely a paltry "20 per cent." but the lull
measure of justice to which she is entitled
and which the administration now refuses to
If the policy of protection Is to continue in
whole or In part to be tolerated by the coun
try it may be well to consider whether It were
noi. better that Its evils should not be at
tempted to be mitigated by piecemeal or pop
gun legislation, but that our efforts should be
reserved until the country has become so sur
feited with its monstrous injustice that it ia
prepared to destroy the whole Eystem of pro
tection and to return to a constitutional and
Just system of taxation for purposes of revenue
only.
It is not believed that it Is the province of
the Democrats in Congress to assist in the
consummation of any such inadequate and ques
tionable scheme. Let the injustice be wholly
or substantially righted, not by piecemeal legis
lation, but by a complete and comprehensive
measure based upon sound Democratic prin
ciples and along right lines. A "reciprocity"
measure Is a misnomer which does not contem
plate at least 50 per cent reduction of the ex
isting tariff burdens. When the people of
Cuba are asking for bread we should not offer
them a stone.
The country Is just now aroused to the In
justice and enormity of the Dingley tariff
(which it should not be forgotten was passed
by a Republican Congress and approved by a
Republican President), especially in its appli
cation to the sister republic of Cuba, and pub
lic sentiment is apparently demanding that the
whole wrong should be righted, but Instead of
that being proposed to be done, the subject is
being Juggled with in the Senate and a tub Is
proposed to be thrown to the whale in the
shape of an unsatisfactory compromise with
Injustice, whereby four-fifths of the offlcial
robbery shall be permitted to remain, not in
the interest of the country, but solely in the
Interest of the "preservation of Republican
harmony."
FRIENDS OF CUBA.
The whole system of governmental favorit
ism, whereby the constitutional power to tax
for the purpose of providing revenue . for the
needs of the Federal treasury â¢ is improperly
used to build up one man's business at the ex
pense of another's, by discriminating in favor
of one Industry as against another, is a vicious
system which has long afflicted the country and
which has grown more and more Intolerable
with years, and against which the Democracy
has ever protested. It is utterly indefensible
upon any Just and proper principle of govern
ment. There Is no justification for the exer
cise of power of legislation to make millionaires
or one class of people and paupers of another.
Discussing the Cuban tariff question
Hill said the present controversy in Cuba
over that subject served to Illustrate the
hypocrisy as well as the unsoundness of
the whole Republican position on the
subject of the tariff. Proceeding on this
topic he said: " '
The subject demands the investigation of
Congress and the prompt punishment of the
offending offlcial if he can be reached through
criminal or military law. The history of the
country does not furnish a more flagrant
breach of offlcial duty as well as of offlcial
propriety than that presented by the misconduct
of Wood. . Yet he - had neither been arrested
nor rebuked nor censured, nor called to ac
count by the administration, but^publlc at
tention to the scandal was sought to be divert
ed by the sudden interposition of a epeclal
message to Congress Imperiously demanding
the passage of a miserable compromise "twenty
per cent" measure -of "Justice to Cuba."
The ex-Senator then took up the sub
ject of Cuba., dealing first with the ad
ministration of General AVood, whom he
bitterly arraigned. l The. use of money
"for partisan and lobbying purposes in
aid of administrative measures pending
before Congress." ne declared, "served to
emphasize the irresponsible and danger
ous character of arbitrary military rule
anywhere, whether temporary or perma
nent." Continuing he said:
should not forget the vigorous and patriotic
action of that Democratic President who honors
this club with his presence here to-night, who
when that same mighty empire of Great Britain
in 1805 attempted to crush the republic of
Venezuela, promptly sent that famous mes
sage to Congress which electrified the country,
wherein he Insisted that Great Britain must
not be permitted, under the pretense of a
boundary dispute. t*o seize Venezuela without
first submitting the alleged difference to ar
bitration, or else this Government would Inter
pose its strong arm for the protection of that
republic. And Great Britain finally concluded
to arbitrate the dispute and Venezuela was
saved from destruction. /

Venice are likely to lead up to international complications. The Italian Embassador at Washington
Â¦ called at the State Department yesterday and entered a protest against Crowninshield's statement

Many otherwise wise men waste money in buying their clothes. They go to high-
priced stores and pay well for the privilege. If they can afford it, then, very well, but
nine out of ten men appreciate saving all that is possible when they buy their suits.
In our store you get full and fair value for every dollar spent â the value lies in the
materials, workmanship and style of the garments. The value is there, as you buy
direct from the makers, and the middleman's usual profits go into the making of the
clothes. Here you get better value for the same money or the same value for less money.
Our $Q suit is what many men want. It comes in solid blue serges and mixed
tweeds and cheviots.-,. It combines style and value.
Men-s striped worsted trousers, variety of patterns, $2.^6 value, for $1.Q5.

Pilot Commissioner Captain W. G. I/eale left
yesterday for Drakes Bay to take up the thread
of a voyage commenced last Thursday. Cap
tala Leale has a summer home at Inverness on
Tomales Bay, where the family of the pilot
commissioner Is at present sojourning. A few
weeks ago Captain Leale put Into commission
the eloop yacht Scout, and last Thursday start
ed to call the craft to Inverness. He started
la tow of a gasoline schooner that was heading
In that direction. Outside the heade a strong
northwester complicated the towing arrange
ment and as a matter of mutual protection the
boats parted company. The schooner continued
her voyage. The pilot commissioners yacht
tried to do likewise, but a freshening of the
pale forced Captrln Leale to run for the friend
ly shelter of Drakes Bay. The Scout has been
there ever 6lnce. Leale went ashore, chartered
an agricultural conveyance and sailed overland
to In\-erness, piloted by a farmer who tired out
the captain by his Insatiable demands for just
one more of "them dlllct stories," and whose
cpringless waeon tested the saJlorman's abil
ltr to bold 03 more vigorously than did the
tumbling of the Scout, Captain Leale left yes
terday for Drakes Bay and expects to be spo
ken off Inverness within a few days.

The question raised by the Archbishop
in regard to a home for girls was taken
up with great enthusiasm, and soon this
will be a part of the work being done by
the society. The following committee was
appointed to confer with the Archbishop:
Past President Mrs. Margaret Dean of
San Francisco; Miss Mary Carr of Oak
land; Mrs. P. J. White. Mrs. D. J. Sulli
van, Mrs. M. F. Smith. Mrs. P. Moore,
Mrs. Malloy and Mrs. H. J. Gallagher of
San Francisco.
Miss Carr, president Catholic Aid Society:
The Catholic Ladles' Aid Society will cele
brate this year the fifteenth anniversary of Its
organization, and it is a great pleasure for
roe, while sending my congratulations to its
members, to testily to the effective work which
has been done by It. The society has accom
plished an immense amount of good, especially
in the city of San Francisco. Thousands have
been helped through its ministrations, and bless
those who have been instruments of its char
ity.
I take this method of submitting the advis
ability of opening as Boon as possible a home
for large girls in San Francisco. The need of
such a home Is most urgent. Catholic girls
from the interior of the State are constantly
coming to this large city seeking employment.
Unless they find the shelter and protection of
a virtuous home they are necessarily exposed
to the manifold temptations of city life. Here,
It seems to me, is a noble work for Catholic
woiren. I am convinced, if the Catholic Ladies'
Aid Society undertakes It, it will succeed. I
beg to thank you for all the good your society
has accomplished in the past and invoke on it
God's choicest blessing for the future.
P. W. RIORDAN,
Archbishop of San Francisco.

A BANKING concern of vast im

of San Francisco will shortly be
established in this city by prom-
inent financiers of New York.
Colonel Francis E. Beck, assistant cash
ier of the Anglo-Callfornian Bank, will be
manager of the new concern.
The institution, which has already es
tablished business in London, Ma
nila and Shanghai, with head offices in
New York, is known as the In
ternational Banking Corporation and
has a paid up capital of $10,,
000,000. Many of the shareholders are
financiers of prominence and include H.
E. Huntington, George Crocker, E. H.

three years, which made this city the
entrepot of trade with Asia, combined
to interest capital in this gigantic enter
prise, the result being the selecvon of San

tenth spasm ended what might have been
another 'steen-inning affair.
Karry Kane, who is sometimes good,
often bad and frequently worse, had the j
ht>i;or of outpitching the tar-famed j
tjeorge Edward Waddell. Kane gave the i
best exhibition of skill he has yet shown ,
eince his arrival. He allowed but five j
eafe swats iu ten rounds, walked three to' ,
first and was so really puzzling that !
fctven Angels found him not on the third <
btrlke. i
Waddell had "plenty to offer, but the |
Pcnies managed to land on him hard at ;
tiires, especially when men were on bases.
His control was good and his curves bet
ter. Ten of the undersized chaps who
work for Harris' glory punched three
times Â¦without result.
The Angels got two for a starter in the
third on a single, an error, a passed ball
and a double steal by Toman and Lawler.
Three consecutive hits, the last a two
bagger by Leahy, tied up the result in
the sixth. Nordyke's double and Par
rovt's pretty single put the Ponies one to
the good in the eighth.
It looked all over when RubÂ© had two
strikes in the ninth, but the giant shooter
again placed the result in doubt with a
Ciean drive over the boards at center.
Ncrdyke opened the tenth for the Ponies
with a single past second, and Holly's out
put him up a notch. Parrott singled to
right and Lawler made a nice throw to
the plate, which Angerson neglected to
stop and Dyke tore in with the point j
which toldL â ,
Jackson, formerly of the New Yorks,
made his bow in local society and played
a fe-ood game. He is an unusually fast
feider and hit the ball hard every time,
though he failed to get it in safe terri
tory. Kane's good stop and Shugart's
hard catch robbed him of two singles.
Lawler's bad judgment of Nordyke's fly
in the eighth cost the Angels a run and
probably the game. The score;.

Californians have a special interest in the reports
of the Briarcliff experiment by reason of the fact that
there is a movement under way to establish a similar
school here. Father Crowley's plan for providing
farm training and education for boys is essentially the
same as that which has been proven "successful in
New York. He docs not ask for $1,000,000, yet the
school' he proposes to undertake will be not inferior
In a recent report the director of the school said:
"Our experience teaches that actual practice in the
field is a most needed supplement of classroom
studies. O.ur teachers will accompany the students
from the classroom to the soil, where practical
demonstration of the best agricultural theories may
be made. At Poughkeepsie, to an extent greater than
has been possible at Briarcliff, the students will
handle farming machinery and tools, prepare the
soil, apply, fertilizers, sow the seed, plant orchards,
make gardens and greenhouses, propagate flowers,
control, insects, treat the diseases of plants and ani
mals and perform every practical detail necessary to
be understood 011 a big or a little farm."
The interest in, the subject lies in the -peculiar na
ture Qf the school. Agricultural colleges are numer
ous in the East. Each State has at least one, and
lheir successes are well understood. Had the Briar
cliff school followed the line of work of the colleges
no speciaHntcrcs't would have been felt in it, for it
would have deserved none. It has attained high re
pute simply from the fact that it aims at teaching
practical farming in a new way to young people who
intend to make the cultivation of the soil their life
work.
CONSIDERABLE interest has been awakened
in the East by the reports of success
achieved during the last two years by a school
of practical farming established at Briarcliff Manor,
on the Hudson. The results have been so satisfac
'tory that it has been determined to enlarge the school
and remove it, to a farm of 415 acres near Pough
keepsie. Moreover, the trustees appeal to the pub
lic for an endowment of Si,ooo,ooo, and it is believed
the money will be promptly contributed.
BACK TO THE LAND.
Despite the appropriation for improved ventilation
the House of Representatives finds its chamber as
sultry and uncomfortable this year as ever. Recently
one of the members went to Mr. Cannon and said:
"Where is all that fresh air we voted money for lastÂ«
year?" Whereupon Cannon growled back: "I don't
know. I told you fellows .you would be derned fools
to pay for a thing you couldn't see, but you would
do it."

Mr. Schwab of the steel trust recently contributed
$500 to buy fireworks for Pittsburg for the. Glorious
Fourth, and the Eastern papers are making as much
display of the fact as would have been made had
Carnegie given half a million for a new library; and
yet everybody has known for a long time that
Schwab has money to burn.
'To move the tents from one place . to
another the idea of employing automo
biles is entertained. In fact, all the fea
tures represent what might be taken for
a regular traveling circus of huge pro
portions by the casual observer. The plan
can only . take ' on -the formative stage
this year. Mr. Leak says that he would
not hope to have the preparatory work
completed before January. In 1903, accord
ing to his plans, California might be
ready to go on the road, occupying at
different" times all the country east of the
Missouri River.
The promoters of this unique enterprise
say that they have already secured suf
ficient promise of co-operation to war
rant them in forming a corporation, and
this they expect to do some time in the
next few days. Mr. Leak has traveled In
the East with the exhibition that Santa
Clara County has kept on the road for *
long period, and it was while he was so
journeying that he conceived the Idea of
exhibiting the products of many counties
simultaneously in the Eastern country.
A meeting will be held in this city.to
day or to-morrow" for the purpose of get
ting moneyed men interested in a novel
proposition, which' is no less than the in
stitution of a traveling encampment to
advertise the resources of California
counties. According to the description of
their ' ambitious plans by M. Leak and
\V. B. Hayford the general idea is to
have a peripatetic county fair -m wheels
to tour the Eastern country. They have
already had pictures made showing what
their traveling Â¦ show would look like. In
one of the pictures a large inclosure Is
seen to be fenced in, and a large crowd
of persons is pouring in through \the
gates. In the inclosure are many tents,
which are supposed to contain as many
county exhibits as there are tenta and to
be tenanted by a representative from

When Prince Henry said the American women
arc lovely the saying was given conspicuous publi
cation all over the country by the men who run the
newspapers, and now the Countess Rochambeau has
said: '"I admire American men, oh, so much!. They
are handsomer and -stronger than ours," perhaps
the women's journals will print the thing in display
type. Praise from a Countess should be valued more
highly than praise from a Prince.

WISH TO EXHIBIT
STATE PRODUCTS
IN MANY TENTS
Occasionally we find some one trying to
belittle another by printing his initials
In small type, but it fails of the mark and
is like profanity, an evidence of a lack of
power of expression. Governor Gage has
at last filed his threatened complaint for
the arrest of John D. Spreckels and W.
S. Leake, and in it he refers to "W. S.
Leake, alias Sam Leake." If "anything
were wanting to show the exceeding
smallness of his excellency this would be
evidence enough. "W. S. Leake" is print
ed at the head of the editorial col
umns every day as manager of The
Call. His friends familiarly, call him
Sam, but this does . not make an
alias. To have made it complete ha
should have ordered his typewriter to
write it "w. s. leake, alias -sam leake."
Then Sam would have felt small!
Colusa Sun.
His Excellency's "Smallness."
There is no authority under our laws by which the
State or any of its officials can grapple directly with
the evil or enforce the remedy proposed. It remains
for the land-owners and farmers to accomplish that
by voluntary action. The example set in Sacramento
County has been followed to some extent elsewhere,
and particularly iii Soiano County, but it should be
followed everywhere. The amount of loss entailed by
the burning over old pastures will be slight in com
parison with that which would follow if the pest
should get firmly established in the State, The losses
inflicted upon Kansas and Nebraska were large, but
they would be as nothing to ;he loss that would fall
upon California, for the orchards, vineyards and
fields of this State are far richer than those which
were devastated there. We have, in fact, an immense
property at stake and should be prompt, resolute
and energetic in taking steps to protect it.
The State Board of Horticulture has undertaken
the work of investigating the extent of the pest and
the location of the breeding-places. Professors and
agents of the State University are also in the field
prosecuting the work of inquiry. It is fair to as
sume that they will be able to decisively locate the
danger points and fix the districts where fire should
be applied. When that information has been ob
tained and given out it will be for the people to do
the Test. '-.:"
The pest is so widely scattered through the State
that the action of a single county avails little. As
soon as the grasshopper develops wings he flies to
whatever places offer him food. Consequently un
less the work of destruction be carried out system
atically and comprehensively the benefits derived
from it will be but partial. What is required in an
emergency of this kind is a general co-operation of
the people in every locality where the pest appears.
If that can be obtained California will be able to vir
tually eradicate the evil this year and will have little
fear of its return next summer. '
Sacramento County has set an example which
should be followed wherever the grasshoppers have
their breeding-places or establish themselves by
migration. The Supervisors of the county, having
found by investigation that the breeding-grounds of
the pest are in pasture lands, they have undertaken to
sweep them clean by fire. When the dry grass is
burned over the grasshoppers are killed and their
eggs destroyed. The remedy is drastic, but' it is
effective. No other known remedy is anything like
so potent for the purpose.
OVER the bright prospects that promised
prosperity for all the rural industries of Cali
fornia there has come a sudden cloud. A
plague of grasshoppers threatens a widespread de
struction of fields and orchards. While the habitual
optimist may see in this visitation nothing more than
ia passing annoyance, it will not do to overlook it.
The experience of Kansas and Nebraska in past years
stands as a warning too impressive to be ignored..
California cannot afford to take chances with a dan
ger of this kind. Every effort should be made to
check the pest at once. It is far better to deal with
it now than to wait until it becomes more widespread
Â¦ and more formidable.

This attempt on the part of Gage to
bring men hundreds of miles away from
their home to answer to a libelâ if any
libel there has beenâ which was perpe
trated at San Francisco, does not seem
very much like seeking a vindication. It
looks more as though Gage were deter
mined not so much to vindicate himself as
to put his critics to all the expense and
trouble possible.
If Gage shall be permitted to sue J. D.
Spreckels and W. S. Leake outside of
San Francisco, the suit should be com
menced in the city of Sacramento, which,
according to the statutes, is the official
residence of the Governor.
But then the statutes can hardly count
in this matter, for Governor. Gage has
frequently shown that he is not amenable
to them.
Another point in this connection. Why
docs Governor Gage bring that suit hun
dreds of miles away from the evidence?
The Controller's office and the records
at San Quentin will furnish the evidence
for both sides.
The Governor has not helped his case by
getting away from the evidence. ,
The place to sue the San Francisco Call
Is where the San Francisco Call is pub
lished. Gage can do these things to
J. D. Spreckels and W. S. Leake, who
have plenty of money with which to fight
back, he could do the same thing to W.
S. Green, of the Colusa Sun, or to some
other independent and fearless journalist,
who has not. .
This is not the first time this has been
done in the State of California, .but it has
been, in all cases, a vicious precedent. .
The people of the State of California,
as a whole, are not very much interested
whether Gage shall win his libel suit
against J. D. Spreckels and W. S. Leaka,
or whether he shall lose. But the peo-r
pie of the State of California, as a whole,
and each and every citizen of this State,
in his own entity, have a direct personal
interest in this matter in this way: if
Henry T. Gage can hale J. "D. Spreckel3
and W. S. Leake, citizens of San Fran
cisco, way down to a little seaside resort;
in Los Angeles Countyâ which happens
to be the particular home of Governor
Gsge's particular chums and friendsâ any
other citizen with plenty of money, such
as Gage has, can do the same to any
other citizen" whom he may accuse of
having libeled him.
Sacramento Bee.
Has Not Helped His Case.
Unless immigration is' resisted by more drastic
restrictions than have yet been imposed we may look
forward to a gradual equalization of- conditions be
tween this country and the sources of the stream that
is flowing upon us. If there be merit in the argu
ment against Chinese immigration it applies with
equal force,- in., its economic sense, to all immigra
tion. We are receiving every six months from
Southern. Europe, more immigrants' than came
in forty years from China. If that Chinese
addition to our unskilled labor . were formid
able enough* to justify t drastic : measures of
prevention, how much more formidable is the great
excess that is pouring in from the low-.wage coun
tries of Southern Europe. The universality of labor
strikes in this country begins to cause apprehension
as to our continued mastery of the world's com
merce. When the remote cause of these strikes is
sought, if. found in this enormous immigration, still
greater apprehension may be felt, for it implies our
decline to the general industrial level of the world.
The conditions from which these poor people are
fleeing are shown by our consular reports. Lyons,
France, is a typical Southern European industrial
center. It is the seat of the silk manufacture of Eu
rope, and a larger proportion of its population are
skilled laborers than in any other French city. The
condition of labor is more favorable than in less
busy localities, so that it must be understood to de
cline from that eminence to a lower level. Our con
sular reports show that in Lyons carpenters receive
13/4 cents an hour; masons, locksmiths,, plasterers,
painters, plumbers, stonecutters, chimney builders
and layers of mosaic pavement n to 12 cents an
hour; common, unskilled labor 9 cents an hour. In
the famous Lyons silk mills the average operator
gets 60 cents a day, and very few, experts can earn
$1 50 a day. A Lyons policeman gets $25 a month.
Is it any wonder that Southern Europe is spilling its
population upon its?
Low wages and high cost of living in Southern
Europe are expelling the surplus population of those
countries, and it is flowing here in a constantly en
larging stream. The head tax of $i 50 imposed by
the Shattuc bill is no restraint at all. The steamship
companies can afford to put up that small sum for
the sake of the trade, and, if they do not, the con
tractors in this country who are importing this alien
labor will do it. It is no more restraint than io
cents, a head would be.
THE enormous increase in foreign immigration
to this country is exciting the attention of
economists. It is largely from Southern Eu
rope and of people that are hardest to digest and
assimilate. The Shattuc immigration bill was
treated as a drastic measure for reform of our immi
gration laws, but when compared with the real emer
gency^ it pretends to meet it merely nibbles the edge
of the question. Restriction of the indigent, illiter
ate and defective classes does not meet the issue.
The wholly mistaken policy of putting foreigners,
the countrymen of the classes restricted, in authority
to enforce our immigration laws largely nullifies
these and all other wholesome provisions of the law.
The recent shakcup in the Immigration Bureau in
New York developed the rottenness of its adminis
tration. The Government might just as logically and
safely put the enforcement of the Chinese exclusion
laws in the hands of the Six Companies.

quisite, number of signatures.
This is absolutely untrue. Neither this

such foolish thing. It is proceeding to

"I do riot agree with the unfavorable
criticisms that have Wen made against
the shed from the sanitary point of
view," said Mr. Dunn. "It is all that
could be desired as a place for the keep
ing of Chinese for a few weeks, but for
a longer period they should be placed else
where."
Inspector James H. Dunn, In charge of
the Chinese Bureau, has recommended to
the department the use or two detention
sheds for the keeping of Chinese await
ing a landing, one for short timers and
the other for those necessarily detained
for long periods during appeal proceed
ings. During the unfounded plague scare
a year or two ago, Chief Dunn requested
Federal Quarantine Officer Dr. Kinyoun to
report on the sanitary condition of the
detention shed.. The report was that the
shed was all that could be desired from
a sanitary point of view and that there
â¢was no clanger of any plague or other con
tagious disease originating there. He
found that it was well lighted (with sun
shine) and well ventilated.
The recently adopted regulation pro
vides that the coolie shall before departing
on a visit to his native land file with the
Collector an affidavit showing his inten
tion to depart and to return within a year
and the fact that he has debts owing to
him in this State to the amount of $1000 or
more. This affidavit will be accepted on
its face as true and no investigation will
be made until the coolie returns from
China at the end of the year. Then his
trouble will begin, for the Collector will
set about to ascertain tho truth of the
facts stated in the affidavit. He will send,
for instance, .to the debtor and will ask
him, "Wong Sing says you owe him $1000.
Is that true?" "No," may be the bland
reply; "I paid him the money before he
left. He lies if he says I owe him any
thing." Thus the debtor gets rid of a
creditor and Wong. Sing is refused read
mission into this country. It was the
practice formerly to Investigate the state
ments made in the affidavits before the
coolie left for China, When the state
ments failed of verification a return cer
tificate was denied and the coolie was
thus given fair warning that if he left
this country he would not be allowed to
return. The Collector will recommend a
return to the old system.
- Customs Collector Stratton Is preparing
his report to the Secretary of the Tr ??^"*
ury on the sanitary condition of the Chi
nese detention shed on the. Mail dock.
His report will be to the effect that, -while
the shed is well adapted for the purpose
of confining Chinese for a few weeks, he
is of the opinion that as a place of de
tention for several months while Chinese
are awaiting- appeal proceedings, the shea
is not what it should be. He will also ask
the Secretary to. modify the recent ruling,
in foreÂ© for the last thirty days, as to the
manner of speeding the parting coolie ana
bidding him welcome home again on his
return from a visit to China.
-r -jr tKEN the Platt amendment ", was adopted
\A/ compelling Cuba to offer her constitution
â¢. Y^ Â» for our approval and making her submit to
a suzerainty heretofore unknown in our national
policy, it was distasteful to a majority of Americans,
who took pains to study it in the light of our declara
tion of absolute and rightful independence of the
island. It was Etill more distasteful to the Cubans
themselves, who came near ceasing to make a con
stitution, with a view of opening war upon their
new masters.
Peaceful counsels prevailed, however, and an em
bassy, was sent to Washington to plead that the Platt
amendment be withdrawn. After long and numer
ous audiences with the Secretary of War the embassy
returned to Havana and reported in favor of adopt
ing the amendment. This was done. Hyhat followed
is explained by recent disclosures. The patriotic as
piration "of the â¢ people to make Gomez the first
President of the republic, for whose freedom he had
fought with. great valor, was by some means sup
pressed and he was induced to withdraw,* as it-ap
pears now, by a large sum of money paid to him by
General Wood under authority of the War Depart
ment. Palma, who had not been in Cuba for nearly
thirty years and was unknown to the present genera
tion, was elected . President, a large majority of the
people not voting.
The people of Cuba and the people of the United
States saw no reason for all this manifestation. We
had declared Cuba of right free - and independent.
We had disavowed any desire to control her action in
any respect, and had disclaimed designs upon her ter
ritory. The Platt amendment was entirely inconsis- .
tent with our professions. Such reasons were given
for it- as men can conjure out of nothing, but the real
reason appeared when the Cuban junta opened head
quarters in New York, hired attorneys and printers
and began an assault upon the farmers of the United
States.
Then began a prolonged and sustained effort to in
vade and break down our protective system. The as
sault was -made in the name of a diaphanous moral
obligation to Cuba. If protection be a principle
there is no moral obligation superior to it. It was
also urged in the name of charity to Cuban industry.
If protection be a principle it is not subject to abate
ment or i ejection because the people of some other
country are in distress. Did we heed the discontent
in Swansea when protection to our tin manufacture
made bread scarce on the tables of the Welsh dip
pers? Did we talk about moral obligations, or char
ity, when a hungry cry went up from the Austrian
button-makers after the McKinley bill domesticated
that industry here? Not at all, because in those days
protection was taught as an economic principle, and
not a policy to be juggled with as expediency dic
tated. / .
When the money payment to Gomez was revealed,
following close upon the admission of Mr. Thurber,
the American ally of the junta, that General Wood
had paid him enormous sums out of the Cuban rev
enues to influence Congress, the long-drawn plot was
made plain. -The War Department announced that
we had promised free trade to Cuba, and then it ap
peared that the embassy which came to Washington
to ask withdrawal of the Platt amendment went back
to ask its adoption because the Secretary of War
had promised them* in return free trade in our mar
kets. Of all this the American people were in ig
norance. The first they knew of it was when the
Secretary of War informed them that they had prom
ised free trade to Cuba, and would be guilty of dis
honor if they broke faith! Effrontery is a gentle
term to apply to such a statement.
The President seems to have been dragged into
the matter by the Secretary of War and should be
glad to be out of it. The War Department can now
retire to its legitimate function and keep hands off
the economic policy of the country. The American
beet farmer has defeated it and its generals in uni
form. Its offensive dictation to Congress must cease,
for the people are tired of it. Protection is safe for
the present and California is, proud that her whole
delegation in Congress stood by the protective prin
ciple from the first challenge to the victory.
The Republican party will deal with the War De
partment, which has succeeded in scandalizing the
administration and in furnishing a fine ammunition
train to the political enemy.

which is about 200 miles to the interior
As far as they could learn several miners
from the new find arrived at Valdes for
additional supplies about ' June 8.i They
communicated the news of the discovery
to one or two of their friends, and in this
way it spread until on June 10 a veritable
stampede had set in. On June 11, the dav
the Excelsior sailed, the town was prac
tically deserted by men. |j The price of
horses Jumped from $50 to- $250, and only
a few were to be had at the latter figure
Captain Moore does not vouch for the
truth of the etory of the find, but he does
guarantee the Information as to the stam
pede. \

jTIMBER IiAND FRAUDS.
.,: BEING* INVESTIGATED
Special Agent Prior on the Trail
After the Perjurers and Their
Employers.
J. R. Prior, special agent of the Land
Office in this city, will leave this morning
for Humboldt County, where he will se
cure evidence in several cases of timber
land jumping in that county. He will
then investigate the alleged land Jumping
and subornation of perjury alleged to
have been committed in the Land Office at
Sacramento.
Mr. Prior said that the extensive forests
in Michigan and elsewhere in the United
State are nearly all cut away by the lum
ber men and Eastern lumber capital
therefore has come to California to invest
in timber lands in large blocks where it
will be profitable to erect sawmills. He
said further that the California yellow
pine lumber was not excelled by that in
any other part of the world, while the fir
and other pine were of good marketable
quality. Hence the rush and the conse
quent hiring of dummies to commit per
jury in filing applications for the land.
TERESA BELL GETS A
SETBACK IN HER SUIT
of D. 0. Mills on a Vital
;,-:;* Point.
Judge ' Morrow Sustains a Demurrer
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday sustained the demurrer of the
defendant in the suit of Teresa Bell, as
special administratrix of the estate of
Thomas Bell, deceased, against D. O.
Mills. The suit was brought to recover
$250,000, with . interest from April 1, 1898,
for the conversion of shares of stock in
mines and railroads around Bellingham
Bay, Washington, pledged by Thomas
Bell to the Bank of California as security
for a loan. The demurrer of the defend
ant was on the ground that at the time
demand was made upon Mr. Mills for the
return of the stock, the sum of money
for which - the stock had been pledged
was not tendered.
This ruling practically amounts to a
decision in favor of the defendant, but
the complainant was allowed until next
August to take such further action as
may be deemed proper.

The Committee on Charter Amend
ments has a large number of proposed
changes In the charter under advisement,
the majority of them referring to the De
partment of Public Works. Â¦ . '.
The text of the charter is changed con
siderably in the amendments, but the
spirit of the legislative act is retained. If
the Supervisors adopt the recommended
amendments to the charter the people of
San Francisco will be called upon to ac
cept them by special^lection. The final
step to make the amendments legal will
be the ratification by the next Legisla
ture.
The committee discussed the proposed
amendments, prepared under its direction
by an attorney. The various amendments
to be recommended to the Supervisors
propose to eliminate the ambiguity exist
ing in trie charter as to the acquisition of
public utilities. The charter provides fcr
a special election for each public utility
to be acquired and the amendments make
it possible for a number of public utilities
to be voted on for acquisition at one elec
tion.
Instead of making it imperative on the
Supervisors to secure, every two years,
data as to the cost of all public utilities,
the amendments will allow the Super
visors to obtain figures as to special utili
ties.
The Committee on Public Utilities and
Charter' Amendments of the Supervisors
met yesterday and spent considerable time
on proposed" amendments to the charter
section relating to the acquisition of pub
lic, utilities. Supervisors Alpers, D'An

present, together with some of the officials
of thÂ« Board of Public Works.

PROPOSE CHANGES
IN THE CHARTER
After twenty-five years of service as
assistant manager of the Palace Hotel,
George B. Warren has resigned and N. S.
Mullen has been appointed- his successor.
About two months ago Mr. Warren left
for Nome to superintend his mining in
terests. He found the claims required a
great amount of his attention and conse
quently resigned his position with the
Palace Hotel. He is one of the best
known hotel men in America and his re
tirement from his position Is deeply re
gretted by the large army of employes of
the hotel, with whom he was very popu
lar.
His successor, N. S. Mullen, was raised
in the hotel business. - He was for many
years '"back of the counter" at Del Monte
and was for some time assistant man
ager of the Van Nuys of Los Angeles. He
resigned the latter post last winter to ac
cept a clerkship with the Palace.
With the present change John McDer
mott, popularly known as "Mack," be
comes head clerk. He has been associated
with the hotel for the last thirteen years
and is one of the most popular hotel
clerks in the- country. Lynn Austin will
again be a clerk of the hotel. He was
formerly a clerk in the hotel, but re
signed last summer to take the manage
ment of the Hotel Rowardennan. Mr.
Austin was at one time connected with
The Call and did clever work in the art
department.

Two hundred wholesale houses of tills
city are directly concerned as members
in the publication of a statement by the
Pacific Commercial Museum regarding
the conditions surrounding the introduc

This is the first report of the sort ever
issued on the Pacific Coast. The purpose
of the- Commercial Museum director is to

very largely official, being Government
documents and the like, but there arc
also reliable private agencies that have
contributed to the report.
John McAdams Exonerated.
Acting United States Attorney Banning
yesterday requested the entry of a nolle
prosequi in the case of the United States
against John McAdams, indicted for pass
ing a counterfeit dollar on a Third-street
restaurant man. The United States Secret
Service people found that McAdams was
a miner of good reputation and that the
bad dollars found on him were part of the
output of the Johnson gang now serving
time in the penitentiary for counterfeit
ing. The authorities believe the bad
money was passed upon McAdams.
The acting secretary of the Coast Sea
men's' Union called upon Acting United
States Attorney Bar.ning yesterday to pro
cure a complaint for the arrest of Cap
tain James Barneson of the transport
Warren for having placed two sailors on
bread and water. The sailors had con
tumaciously refused to salute the captain
when ordered to do so. Mr. Banning re

(oiiowing members are in the party:
The boy immediately started to Van
couver on a bicycle and on his arrival no
tified Sheriff Marsh. The officers tele
phoned Deputy Warden Carson at Wood
land to meet officers at the Targerson
place as soon as possible. A posse, con
sisting of Sheriff Marsh, City Marshal
Norton and a half-dozen men, then left
at once for the point where the convlct3
arc reported to have been seen.
If the story, told by young Tarperson Is
true Carson's bloodhounds should be able
to pick up the trail left by the convicts,
although the dogs and posse could not
have reached tne Targerson place before
3 o'clock, six hours after the outlaws
were seen. This, however, would be tho
freshest scent of the fugitives since Car

day.

a few miles from Pioneer, came to Van

clared that the horsemen taken for the
outlaws Tuesday were Ayers' father-in
law, Shively, and a companion, who left
home Tuesday forenoon to take up tim
ber claims back of Lewisville. Ayers did
not learn until this morning, when Shive
ly and his companion returned and re
lated the story of having been fired at in
the brush along Lewis River, that the
men had been mistaken for the outlaws,
but upon being. convinced that such was
the case came to Vancouver at once to
notify the Sheriff.
SALEM, Or., June 19. â Governor Geer
to-day granted a full pardon to Frank
Ingram, the convict who risked his life
on June 4 in an attempt to prevent Tracy

escaping from prison. Ingram was sen
tenced to the penitentiary in 1SD2 for life
for killing his brother during a quarrel.

cording to a report brought here at 11
o'clock to-day by Reuben Targerson, a

We therefore respectfully request that you
give us such assurance so that we In turn may
proceed under the direction of Professors Wood-
That the owners ofÂ»sald land will not suffer
â¢or permit the burning of eaid land without
considerable and expensive litigation, and It
is possible that an agreement may be en
tered into with said owners by which their
consent to the damage to their property may be
obtained upon the condition that the State com
pensate them for the loss of their pasturage,
and that said owners will most likely so con
sent If they have the assurance that you will
recommend to the next Legislature the passage
of an appropriation to cover their said loss,
which appropriation is not to exceed in anj
event the sum of $10,000.
That It appears to us from the Investigations
of Professor C. W. Woodworth and Professor
Warren T. Clarke of the University of Cali
fornia, and we here represent that there are
now in said counties of El Dorado, Placer and
Sacramento some thousands of acres of unculti
vated land, some of which is used for pasture,
owned by private parties, which are present
breeding places of said pests, and by the burn
ing of said uncultivated land the grasshoppers
will be greatly diminished in numbers, and the
infested conditions of said counties, as well as
of other portions of the State, will be greatly
relieved.
That a large portion of thÂ£ farming and
fruit-growing- lands of the State, particularly
in the counties of El Dorado, Placer and Sacra
mento, is now seriously Invaded by grasshop
pers, and the situation is growing daily so
grave as to threaten the destruction of orchards
and vineyards of said counties as well as of
other counties of the State, and the danger is
imminent, grave and far reaching In its con
sequence.
Sir â The undersigned Commissioners of the
State Board of Horticulture respectfully repre-
The communication sent to the Gov
ernor by the State Board of Horticulture
follows: * !
SACRAMENTO. June 10, 1902.
Hon. Henry T. Gage, Governor of the State of
California.
That the strongest po'ssible preventive
against further damage by the pest is ex
tremely urgent is shown by the expedi
tion with* which the matter has been
brought before the Governor by scien
tists and the means suggested to him for
the radical extermination of the grass
hopper. Â¦
BREEDING PLACES OF PESTS.
The expression given, however, by At
torney General Ford that he has no
doubt that compensation will be awarded
to those who must suffer by the fires will
have the effect of gaining ready and vol
untary consent to that course being
adoDted.
Many owners in Placer and El Dorado
counties have not taken kindly to the
proposal to burn over their land, even
though It would.be the means of prevent
is'g the spread of the plague which has
threatened most costly and serious re
sults.
The State Board of Horticulture has
been made aware almost daily of the
alarming inroads made by the pest, and,
noting the danger of devastation to the
vineyards and orchards, took urgent steps
after receiving the opinion of the Attor
ney General to seek executive aid.
The Attorney General said last night
that he . had no doubt the â¢ Legislature
would make an appropriation to pay for
any property necessarily destroyed.
A CONFERENCE was held at the
Palace Hotel yesterday between
the State Board of Horticultural
Commissioners and M. J. Dill
man, chairman of the Board of
Supervisors of Sacramento County, for
the purpose of reaching some understand
ing relative to the measures necessary to
effectively fight the grasshopper plague.
Governor Gage, Professor Woodworth
and Warren T. Clarke of the Agricultural
College were also present, and the serious
situation occasioned by the invasion of
Placer, Sacramento, Madera, Tulare, San
Bernardino and San Diego counties by
grasshoppers was thoroughly discussed.

SACRAMENTO, June 19
J. J. Keegan, Secretary of the State Board of
Horticulture.
I trust that in view of the grave situation
the Supervisors and Horticultural Commission
ers of the several infested counties will take
Immediate action and use the most stringent
measures to assist your honorable board In your
laudable efforts to avert this great threatened
public calamity.
Gentlemen : In answer to your representa
tion this day made, wherein it appears that
certain lands within the counties of El Do
rado. Placer and Sacramento are greatly af
lected by the grasshopper pest, and that the
pest is increasit? ana threatens to destroy a
considerable portion of the products of the
State, and it further appears that the danger
is imminent and grave and far-reaching in its
consequences and that by burning certain pas
tures within this Ssate the calamity may be
avoided; in view of this condition and in or
der to avert such menacing public calamity,
I assure you that I will recommend to the next
Legislature that a proper appropriation be
passed for the benefit, of those private owners
in said counties of El Dorado, Sacramento and
.Placer, who shall consent to the damage to
their land; provided, however, that In no event
shall the amount of such appropriation exceed
$10,000, amount' being the excess sum fcs
timated by Professors C. W. Woodwcrth and
Warren T. Clarke of the University of Califor

ments for compensation to the owners of the
damaged land shall be made only by the State
Board of Horticultural Commisioners; that the
grass on said lands shall be burned by author
ity of said Board of Horticultural Commission
ers under the immediate advice and direction
of said Professors Woodworth and Clarke, and
that under no circumstances is It to be under

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, June 19. â There was quite an
animated shaking out of speculative accounts
In to-day's stock market and a sharp reaction
from the recent prolonged advance. It became
evident soon after the opening this morning
that the real culmination of the rise had 00
curred yesterday. The leading speculative in
terests in the market apparently took advant
age of the stimulating effect of yesterday'))
excited rise In Illinois Central to take profits.
This morning: there were 6ome operations that
seemed to represent continued efforts to ad
vance the market by one or two of the im
portant speculative parties whose Joint efforts
have induced the iate rise. But the effective
support of the principal speculative interest
was lacking and the professional traders were
able to detect sales to take profits for that
account. They needed no other invitation to
turn aggressively to the bear side and sold the
list throughout with great freedom. Prices
rave way readily and fell on an average of
ficm one to two points below last night's
level. The bears were so precipitate In their
selling that they were obliged to bid quite
urgently for etocks when they came to take
profits, causing ecme good rallies. With the
demand from shorts satisfied, the market yield
ed again and closed dull and irregular. The
whole movement was technical and was as
little affected by news of the day as the pre
vious advance had been. The activity of the
bears was evident In the circulation of alarm
ist rumors afterward denied. One was that
J. P. Morgan was seriously 111. Another was
that a fresh judicial decision had been ren
dered against the United States Steel bond
issue. The earlier weakness was confined to
stocks which have been favorites during the
bull campaign, but active selling of United
States Steel developed under the Inlluence of
these rumors and carried, that stock down 1%
below last night. The long continued rise in
stocks has made the professionals alert for
signs of reaction, which was considered over
due. The short selling from time to time has
encouraged the bulls to extend the advance and
force covering. A large portion of this short
account was forced out in yesterday's Jump in
prices, adding to the technical weakness of the
market to-day. The stirring of Interest by out
siders, which was first manifest yesterday also
facilitated the profit- taking by the Insiders in
the bull campaign. There was no unfavorable
news to-day which has not been under dis
cussion for some time past. But In the changed
sentiment of the speculation, additional con
sideration Is. given by the national convention
of the coal miners and the effort to bring
about a general strike. The too-abundant rains
where wheat harvesting is In progress and the
continued drought in Texas also received more
attention than hitherto. Sterling exchange wa*
still Dim here and declined at Paris both

The Business Outlook.
THE SITUATION AS SEEN THROUGH
WALL-STREET EYES.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The crop situation as a whole is very en
couraging. In spite cf the reduction of wheat
acreage the present outlook is for a crop of
about 040.000,000 bushels. This is more than
lOO.OQO.OfK) de-crease compared with the crop
of 1U01; but last year was a banner year, and
the prospect Is that we shall have a wheat
crop that has been exceeded only oncÂ«; that
was by the crcp of 1898, when the total yield
was Â«75,OO0.O0o. Nothing is yet definitely
known concerning the corn crop, though a
larger acreage is considered Inevitable in view
of recent high prices, and a second failure such
ms last year is beyond all reasonable probabili
ties. So the country seems fairly assured of
ample wheat and corn crops. The same Is true
cf cotton, in which the slightly increased acre
age and Improved conditions suggest a some
what larger crop than the last one. If these
three Important crops turn out well we may
be assured of another season of good business
In the South and West. A good surplus for
export Is highly desirable, as the recent ten
dency of our foreign trade has been toward
decreased exports and diminished trade bal
ances; and It would be much more convenient
for us to ship corn, cotton and wheat next
winter than gold, of which we may have plenty,
but which it Is desirable to retain if we are
to preserve easy money rates.
"The industrial outlook Is somewhat con
fused by the aggressive attitude of labor, which
if cot moderated is likely to check enterprise,
for even present abnormal activity cannot con
tinve indefinitely to face increased cost of
production. If costs are pushed much higher
we shall unquestionably see an enforced cur
tailment of both production and consumption
that would in the end react most seriously upon
labor itself. With more steadiness in the labor
situation there is good reason to hope for
another year of satisfactory business. In the
money market there Is practically no change.
Closer rates may be temporarily expected pre
vious to the July disbursements, but easy
rates will generally prevail until crop de
mands begin. The situation will be addition
ally relieved by the abolishment of war taxes
after July 1, which have tended to unneces
sarily lode up funds in the Treasury. Bank
loans throughout the country etill show largo
expansion, chiefly the result of borrowing by
etrocg eyndicatea and others. Some contrac
tion has recently taken place, and the char
acter cf torrowirig; explains the absence of un
easiness at la-ge expansion. The fart that the
banks are well loaned up act* as a powerful
restraint upon the promotion of undesirable
â¢cherries, cf which there would bÂ« an uncom
fortable array were It not for the increased
difficulty of* financing such schemes imposed bv
b&nkers. There i> etill an ample supply of
funds for all legitimate purposes.
"Conditions are thus favorable for a good
trading market for some weeks to come. There
U no material fcr a bear campaign, and a bull
eamptlim would be rather difficult to inaugu
rate until the big leaders are agreed and the
public ehowe a sharper appetite f cr stocks,
which It is very likely to do after sufficient
reet. Already there Is an improving investment
demand for good securities, which promisee
better things when the time is ripe for action.
In many respects the market position Is bet
ter than at any time since President McICln
ley's death: end the same powers are stli!
under the market which sustained It then and
have persistently supported It ever since.
When the public appelUe for speculation re
vives, when funds now locked up In syndicate
operations are released, when some of the
deals now !n the air approach consummation,
Â¦wlien the crcp outlook becomes more certain,
Â¦when labor moderates He demands, we may
Jook fcr a revival of confidence and general Im
provemert. Meanwhile, cood stocks bought on
recessions are likely to afford a profit if sold
on the moderate railica, the outlook being, as
eaid above, favorable to a rood trading mar
ket." t

v CHICAGO, June 19. â Corn, though fairly
active for an ordinary day, dropped back into
second place-to-day. Wheat ruled uniformly
strong throughout the session. At the start
Paris cables showed rapid advances, spot being
as much as 3%c higher, while deferred futures
ehowed 3%c advance. There was talk' of
some deal on In Paris, but it must have been
of great proportions,- for it influenced ,-naterlai
upturns in flour. -Wet and cold weatherabroad
was talked of and some, traders were of the
opinion that French stocks of wheat were
about depleted. It takes 7,000.000 Jjushels
weekly to supply that country. This influence
was abetted by firmness in. Liverpool cables.
Wet weather here also had Its influence. There
'was rain in 'many aarts-of the winter wheat
country. â¢ Kansas, where cutting Is now In
progress, reported muclv. moisture In the yield
and that a considerable, -Quantity .uf the har
vested-, wheat would hot. grade contract be
cause ol the dampness. This talk alarmed the
shorts. Covering started a good" upturn and
ptop-!osÂ« orders were" met on the advance..
July opened -a shade to 3 ,sÂ©lic higher at 72 %c
to 72VÂ«c, dipped to 729> 1 ?ii2%c and then mount
ed-steadily to 7."J%c. Toward the close some
wheat came out for profits and July dipped a
trifle. The close, however, was strong, July
!5Â«lc.up at 73%c.
After some fair early strength shown in the
corn pit by reason of a desire of a few belated
shorts 1 to ccver, this pit assumed something of
a somnolent state. The feeling was still tense
and at times there were little excited Hurries.
Prices at Â«.ich times fluctuated somewhat er
laticallX. As the day . wore â¢ on. . however, It
became 'apparent that the bull leaders were
letting the market care for Itself. July sold
between Â«6c and Â«5c, covered differences Â©f %c
several times and closed easy, Vic down, at
C5Vic. \ Â¦
Oats were dull land worked over a range of
only Vic. July Llosed %Â£Â»4ic up at 39%Â®

Provisions showed good strength and fair
activity. July i>ork closed 15c up, lard 12'/2@
15c up and ribs 15c up.

The Egg market is getting demoralized. At
this timer of â¢ the year when many people are
out of town and the local consumption is at
it? lowest point, the market can absorb about
1000 â¢ cases per day, â¢ whereas we are now re
ceiving- about 1450. This means an " excess of
about 4,->0 cases every day, and at this rate
it does not take long tc glut the market. This
is the condition of the Kgg market to-day. Ev
ery dealer has more than he can sell, and
his. stocks are increasing daily. There is only
one thing for him to do to keep them down,
which is to store. At present prices this is
very: hazardous, as he dan hardly come out
even' with these stored Eggs in the fall. But
he has no alternative. Most- of the trade
began to store yesterday, and the storing will
be continued until conditions improve. Mean
while both., ranch and store Eggs are being of
fered in all sorts of lots at reduced prices.
One lot of 100 cases of store Eggs from San
Luis Obispo County was offered yesterday at
joc without finding a buyer, and offers to sell
fine ranch at 18iic were generally declined
by buyers. A few dealers still quoted 20c, but

when she arrived here. Edson gave up
his chase after Dunham, the murderer,
for the time being and Jumped on the rear
end of the train, returning to Tucson to
see that the woman did not escape him.

YOTJTHPTTL INCENDIARY
MAKES A CONFESSION
San Francisco Lodge of Elks Shows
Friendship for Oakland.
OAKLAND, June 19.â The charge of ill
feeling existing between San Fransisco
Lodge No. 3 of Elks and Oakland Lodge
No. 171 over the failure of Oakland Lodge
â¢to -receive the San Francisco Elks is de
nied by San Francisco Lodge. The fol
lowing circular has been issued by Ex
alted Ruler Percy V. Long of San Fran
cisco Lodge, which shows the falsity of
the charge of ill feeling:
SPECIAL. NOTICE.
SAN FRANCISCO, June lg, 1002.
Dear Sir and Brother: On Monday last as
mary of us as could went to Oakland to help
make merry and boost No. 171's Street Fair
and Carnival. It was GREAT! We entei
talned ourselves then, and Oakland No. 171
now wants to entertain us in their own way.
A special boat will leave the Oakland ferry,
foot of Market street, at 7:45 p. m., Saturday,
June 21, which will be met by special train
and our party conveyed to Seventh and Broad
way. Oakland, where we will be met by escort
and 'carriages for officers and ladles and taken
to the carnival grounds.
Your exalted ruler makes personal request
that all members of B. P. O. E. No. 3 avail
themselves of Oakland's kind Invitation. By
order of PERCY V. LONG, Exalted Ruler.
HERMAN KOHN, Secretary.
There was no effect upon the attend
arce yesterday by the attack upon the
fair, for nearly 2000 more people passed
through the gates on Wednesday than
the day previous, and the number on the
day after the attack was within a few
hundred of the opening Saturday.
Thousands are coming from San Fran
cisco every day and night, which shows
that instead of being ill feeling there is
i a desire on the part of San Franciscans
! to â¢ visit the Elks Carnival.
Oakland is appreciative of this, as the
carnival is bringing thousands of visit
ors to this city from the outside.
ATTACK IS DENIED.
Thousands of the 20,000 people who
crowded into the grounds after the
parade surged around tUe band stand to
see and hear the programme.
The Woodmen and candidates for wood
craft afterward adjourned to the Macdon-
Woodcraft mingled with Elkdom to
night at the Street Fair. It was Wood
craft night by the grace of Elkdom and
the resonance of axes cleaving chips out
of the forest of pleasure was the thing
that waa heard above the din of every
thing else. Woodcraft sent its hundreds
and attracted its thousands. Woodcraft
entertained. Woodcraft's parade was the
most prodigious that ever any fraternal
order has turned into the streets of Oak
land. Altogether there were 2000 men in
the line that threaded its way through
the main avenues. And nearly all of
them came from Alameda County, too.
San Jose sent a special trainload of them,
but they only swelled the ranks by 200.
Grand Marshal J. F. Kick took hold of
the reins in time and his hosts of follow
ers were upon the waiting thousands that
lined the streets before they knew it.
The police braved the front of the pro
cession and brushed aside the ubiquitous
small boy, making clear the pathway for
the grand marshal and his aids â Thomas
M. Robinson, A. G. Saunders and the mil
itary band.
A warrant was Issued in the Elks'
court of injustice to-night for Mayor Eu
gene E. Schmitz of San Francisco for fail
ure to appear. Mayor Barstow of Oak
land has given bonds for the appearance
of Mayor Schmitz on Saturday night,
when the chief executive of San Fran
cisco will be arrested and sentenced.
No " masking will be allowed on Satur
day night and those presenting them
selves at the fair with masks will be re
fused admittance.
The San Francisco Elks will be wel
comed Saturday night.
To-morrow night there will be a parade
of all the midway attractions on the
street between 7 and 8 o'clock.
OAKLAND, June 19.â Director Gen
eral Max L. Schlueter of the

CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 19.â President
Roosevelt, after several days of inaction
so far as Cuban concession is con
cerned, during which time the im
pression, got abroad that he would
not in any way . try to promote
the passage of the bill, or the taking of
other action by Congress, began to-night
to use his influence for the carrying out
of this work by the Senate. The
passage by the : " Republican State
convention of Nebraska of resolu
tions indorsing the special message to
Congress and declaring that tariff conces
sions to Cuba ought to be made, gave the
President great encouragement. Both
Nebraska Senators have been opposing the
reciprocity bill, declaring that its passage
was inimical to .the interests of their
State and was not wanted by the Nebras
ka farmers.
The resolutions are regarded In' the
White' House as a repudiation of Senators
Dietrich and Millard and the President
took great pleasure in showing them to
day a newspaper containing the Nebraska
platform.
Earnest efforts are being made by the
President and the administration Senators
to get the Senators who have ' not Â¦ allied
themselves with the reciprocity combina
tion to line up and put the entire Senate
on record. They realize that the chief
trouble has not been the opposition of the
beet sugar Senators, but the indifference
of a very large number of so-called ad
ministration Senators who are secretly
knifing the President. . . .
President Roosevelt had a long talk to
night with Senators Platt, Allison, Spoon
er, Lodge, ' Aldrich and Hale. He told
them he was as anxious as ever that re
lief to Cuba should be granted at this ses
sion. He said it made no difference to him
whether it was done by a reciprocity bill
or a reciprocity treaty. His position was
that reciprocity "must" be granted and
he was prepared to occupy that position
until the adjournment. ...
He had heard, the President said, a sug
gestion that the Senate caucus should
pass a resolution referring the whole mat
ter back to him, and suggesting that Cu
ban relief be accomplished by a treaty.
It was not necessary, he said, for the Sen
ate conference to pass any resolution
about the treaty. It was much more
necessary that the Senate should stop its
fighting from ambush and come out into
the open. There had been no public vote
on this bill and until there was a vote
he was not supposed to know that the
Senate was opposed to the bill. Until that
vote was taken he could not be" expected
to take any initiative looking to the ne
gotiation of a treaty.
As a result of this talk with the Presi
dent much more energetic efforts will be
made at the adjourned Republican con-
Special Dispatch to The Call.

Steam Schooner Eureka
Goes Ashore Near
Mussel Rock.
Crew Gets to Land Safely,
Though First Boatload
Is Capsized.
The steam schooner Eureka is ashors
about ten miles south of the Cliff Housa
and just north of Mussel Rock. She wan
dered cut into the fog from the safe shel
ter of the bay yesterday afternoon and
soon became bewildered and helpless in
the enshrouding mist and fluttered blindly
to her doom on the sand "which holds
her in its stubborn clutch.
The vessel is aground about four mile3
below the bones of the schooner Re
porter, which went ashore under very
similar circumstances a few months ago.
The Eureka left this port yesterday
afternoon, with Captain Schou in com
mand, laden with lumber and merchandise
for -the city of Eureka. At 9 o'clock last
night she ran on the beach, far out ot
her course. The first news of the disaster'
that had overtaken the vessel was
brought to the Southslde Life-saving Sta
tion, four miles below the cliff, by a be
draggled sailor, who came there to apply
for helD. He said that as soon as tha
vessel was beyond aid a boat was lowered
and the men aboard prepared to get
ashore. The first boatload was capsized,
the surf running high, but the sailors
managed to right the boat and got ashore.
The Eureka was lying broadside on.
the man said. The crew waa gathered
around a bonfire its membera had built
on the beach.
The life-saving crew started out for tha
wreck, pushing a boat on rollers. It waa
understood that the captain would re
main aboard the ship and that the sail
ors would all come to the station.
It was supposed that the incoming tide
would throw the Eureka higher up on the
beach and render her a hopeless wreck.
Just how the wrecked vessel got out of
her course was not learned.

Mayor Causes Consternation.
The reductions and eliminations mada
by Mayor Schmitz in the tax budget has
caused consternation In the several de

the chief executive. Dr. Williamson,
president of the Health Board, stated yes
terday that the large cut made in the
Health Department will seriously cripple
it. He refers to the elimination â¢ of the.
item for salary of statistician on the
ground that one of the clerks can do tha
work, yet the Mayor also abolished the
positions of assistant secretary and ona
clerk. Commissioner Casey of the Board
of Works declined to express an opinion.
Other heads of departments said that the
abolishing of positions would necessitate*
reductions in salaries in order to provida
sufficient help to do the city's business.

THE SAjST FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 20, 1902i

REFORM BOYCOTT.
The undertakers of San Francisco are un-
friendly to cremation because the expense, is
very much less than that of Interment. They
know that If cremation sets the pace in fu-
neral reform reduced prices, must be met, or
graveyards closed.' They , control over five
hundred hacks, the drivers of which belong
to the Hackmen's Union, Local No. 224. That
union (through misrepresentation made to
them) has resolved not to drive for us at our
funerals or rent hacks to attend them.
We think the friends of cremation will, if
necessary, dispense with a string of hacks
and the services of the undertakers rather
than see incineration obstructed by a' cause-
less heartless boycott of the dead.
We own two first-class carriages and' at-
tractive hearses and horses, which we will
furnish upon application. For further In-
formation, call at No. 429 Golden Gate ave.

NEW SIGN ORDINANCE
The opposition of McEnerney's clients is
the result of the UMeeling known to exist
between them amd Mrs. Emma Merritt
and Charles Sutro, executors of the Sutro
will. The claim is made that the execu
tors have not made any endeavor to 1 pro
vide for the payment of the sums left the
four children in the will and have tried
to delay the payments by providing for
the other legacies first.
The matter will be heard to-day.
The fact became apparefft yesterday in
Department 9 Â¦ of â the Superior Court,;
when the; petition of Â¦ Mary 'H.< Kerr and;
others for the distribution of their- lega
cies under the will of Adolph Sutro^came!
up for hearing. ; . . ;

resentative of Mrs. R. , Morblo, Edgar:
Sutro, Mrs. Kate Neusbaum -and Mrs.
Clara English. Sutro's children,, started
the ball rolling by objecting to the grant
ing of the petition. He claims that as
the Sutro estate owed . $500,000, no further
action in' the distribution proceedings:
should be taken. "There is no' money,"
said the attorney; ."to pay the legacies, ,
amounting to $16,000, mentioned in to-day's
petition. Besides, my clients, children of.
Sutro, have not yet received their legacies;'
of $10,000 each left them in the will. and
ordered distributed to them in this, court. â¢
"I think they, have first claim upon the

any trouble with a patient before. He
says Shields used abusive language to
him and struck him with the water bottle
before he grasped him by the throat. After
he left Shields he returned iiJid Shields
continued his abuse, when he struck him
on the face. He is now sorry for losing
his temper and striking Shields, and says
2:e is prepared to stand the consequences.
Flinck left Shields, but immediately re

blows en the face, only desisting when
Shields yelled for help. The. head nurse

bottle, cutting his eyebrow and his left
ear.

to ; have Judge Fritz set a date
when the defendants would be given a
hearing, and Judge Fritz stated that he
would take the matter up this morning,
at which time he would set a date for the
hearing of arguments on an elaborate
scale.
"Oh. that's all right. Sheriff," said Mr.
Spreckels: "you don't need to bother
about reading that." Attorney E. F.
Preston then handed Judge Fritz a type

Mail coming to the officers and mem
bers of the Marine Engineers' Association
is usually placed in a letter box at the
headquarters on East street and members
obtain the key from the. janitor and help
themselves to their own mail. It is the
theory of the prosecution that in this way
Mullen secured the letter containing the
money order.
The most important j witness for the
prosecution was- Andrew Jacksbn ; paying
teller of. the /money \order - department in
the main Postofflce on -Washington street.
Mr. Jackson', positively 'identified- the pris
oner* as the man who presented the or
der, received the money and "signed the
name of J. J. Searey to the paper. J. M.
Benson, financial secretary of the Marine
Engineers' Association, testified that the
Searey signature on .the order was a for
gery. John P. West, a letter-carrier,
swore that, the indorsement of his name
on the order, as an;identifler of Mullen
was a forgery.
John Kingston, who carries letters on
Polk strtet in the district in which Mul
len resides, related that Mullen came to
hini four or five months ago with a money
order and requested Kingston to identify
him by indorsement. Kingston, seeing
that the order was. not made payable to
Mullen, refused to give the indorsement,
whereupon Mullen explained that the or
der was made payable in his stepfather's
name,, which was Mullen's "other name,"
but Kingston declined to sign it even
after Mullen's ingenious explanation.
Mullen is said to. have borne a good
reputation, but in spite of this fact, the
evidence being so damaging. Acting
United States Attorney Banning refused
to agree to bail lower than $2000.
The complaint was made by Postoffice
Inspector L. II. , Bricker, who - accused
Mullen of/ having forgsd the, name of J.
J. Searoy,:.to. a -.postal money order for
$2150, sent from Eureka by Robert Lead
better as his dues to Secretary, Searey of
the Marine Engineers' Association.- ;
John PI Mullen, second assistant engi
neer on the steamer Pomona, was held to

by : United j States Court Commissioner
Heacock yesterday on a. charge of for
gery. . Â¦. " i -. ' Â¦ '" .. _ " ' -.-
HarryxKnox and Richard Cornelius of
the Carmen's Union said the. condition
would compel the United Railroads to
recognize the union, which it had not
heretofore done. It refuses now to treat
with the men as representatives of the
union, but only as employes.
Jesse Lillenthal. attorney for the Pre
sidio road, thought the condition legal if
an express waiver is made, and George
A. Isewhall. president of the same road,
said he would bid if such a clause were
inserted, isewhall said the United Rail
roads had In\-aded his company's terri
tory and has sent agents to influence the
residents to favor its own particular ap
plication. Newhall also said that if a
franchise is not to be granted his concern
would sell the road to the city and take
bonds in payment. ~
Lillenthal objected to the granting of
the application of the United Railroads m
the north end on account of invading the
Presidio road's territory.
Tobin said the franchise could be bid
upon -by any person or corporation, and
no particular one can be favored.
J. B. Harris, superintendent of the Cal
ifornia street railroad, said his company
would comply with the conditions rela
tive to union labor. The committee then
postponed action for another week.
WANT UNION RECOGNIZED.
Reed then submitted a proposed reso
lution inviting proposals. for the sale of a
franchise for a street road on Bay and
Buchanan streets. The conditions im
posed provide that the city may at any
time purchase the said franchise after it
has been sold to the highest bidder upon
payment of the 'cost of construction.
Also, that the city may operate its own
cars upon any portion of the railway
tracks owned by the corporation for a
distance of ten blocks upon payment of
one-half the cost of construction and ex
pense Of maintenance. Also, that at the
end of a twenty-five-year term the road
shah become the property of the city.
â¢Another point on which no satisfaction
could be obtained from the United Rail
roads was that relative to Inserting a
condition in the proposal for sale of fran
chise that union men solely should be
employed. Tobin would not give an an
swer until he had consulted with the of
ficials of the company, but said he con
sidered the condition unconstitutional,
unfair and unjust.
INVITES PROPOSALS.
The Supervisors' Street Committea
again postponed action yesterday on the
petition of the UnitetT Railroads for a
franchise to operate an electric road on
Bay, Buchanan, Post and Leaven-worth
streets to the Presidio, Montgomery ave
nue and East street. Another unsuc
cessful effort was made by the commit
tee to exact a promise on the part of Ja
seph S. Tobin, attorney for the corpora
tion, to agree to the use of five biocks
on Market street in conjunction with the
proposed municipal ownership of the
Geary street line. Replying to a question
from Braunhart as to whether Tobin
would concede the right to Â¦ the city to
use five blocks the last named said:
"That is a question which I must sub
mit to the company. I will submit tho
matter of using the road on Market
street for less than five blocks to our
board of directors,, but I do not hold out
any hope that the answer will be favor
able to the city. Under section 499 of the
code we could hot grant the city t..e
right to njm more than five blocks on
Market street."
"The applications of the Presidio road
and the United Railroads would be use
less to any other companies," said ex-
Supervisor C. W. Reed, "and these com
panies alone will bid for the privileges.
The action of the United Railroad3 in re
fusing to grant the use of five blocks on
Market street to the city is strongly to
be condemned. The corporation is in pos
session of: valuable privileges, of which
the franchise alone is worth $1S,000.000,
which is in effect a gift from the city.
That the company should decline to give
reciprocal privileges to the city is as
tonishing. They are now using East
street by State sufferance, yet they wish
to deny the city the privileges which they
themselves exercise illegally."
