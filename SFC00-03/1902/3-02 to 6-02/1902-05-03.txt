TRIAL OF HOWARD.
'General MacArthur insisted that there
had been a great upheaval and the ground
*wc!l was still apparent, some of the in
cidents of war continuing even after the
pacification of a locality.
Culberson went through most of the bill
of right?, his questions seeking to de
vJop that fundamental rights had not
been implanted in the islands. General
MacArthur maintained, however, that all
of the fundamental rights except trial by
jury and the right to bear arms were In
operation as far as conditions would per
mit. He read a proclamation he had
Issued specifying most of the constitu
tional rights.
The committee in executive session
agreed, at the request Â¦ of Rawlins, to
summon Corporal William W. GIbbs, now
at. Springfield, Mass.. he having been an
eye-witness of the massacre of Balangi

FUNDAMENTAL BIGHTS.
WASHINGTON. May 2.â General Mac-
Arthur was Interrogated to-day by Sen
ator Culberson of Texas in a rather iron
ical vein at the hearing before the Phil
ippine Committee. The general bad re
ferred to the advantage of implanting
republican institutions in the island. Cui
bcrson asked if the Declaration of Inde
pendence and the constitution were not
the foundation for republican institutions.
General MacArthur answered that the
whole constitutional history of the coun
try, with the preceding English history,
together with the Declaration of Inde
pendence, together with the constitution
had to be considered. Culberson took each
of the principles of republican institu
tions, free speech, free press, self-govern
inont, trial by jury, etc., and asked, how
far these had been implanted in the Phil
ippines. As. to free speech General Mac-
Arthur said he had. told the Filipinos that
Jf they would give him their guns they
could have a mass-meeting on every cor
ner. He said soldiers were quartered in
private houses as an incident to war.
This led to a discussion of whether war
was 5n cx!stence.

VENICE, May 2.â In an interview with
a representative of the Associated Press
the Imprisoned officers of the cruiser Chi
cago warmly repudiated the reports from
Rome that they were under the. influence
of wine at the time of the trouble, and
said that, on the contrary, they were ab
solutely sober. Lieutenant John S. Dodd
ridge remarked:
- "After the accidental upsetting of a
table in a cafe by myself and a compan
ion at 11 o'clock at night we were fol
lowed and attacked by a mob and two
municipal policemen appeared on the
scene, I with my open hand motioned to,
the crowd to keep off. The police then
seized us, but the mob continued go
threatening that our brother officers and
a marine who happened to be on the
piazza ran to our rescue. We acted only
in self-defense and against a large hostile
crowd. We did not strike the police.
Doubtless the misunderstanding of the
two languages had something to do with
the trouble. We have been allowed to re-"
main together In prison, but the room In
which we have been confined swarmed
with Insects."
THREATENED BY THE MOB.
Whether this can be done, in view of
the action of the King in granting a par
don, remains to be determined. . While
grateful for the liberation of Captain
Wynne, Lieutenant Doddridge, Assistant
Surgeon Ledbetter and a private \ of ma
rines, it is insisted that this was only an
act of justice and that it should not be
allowed to stand in the way of a demand.

Captain Dayton will describe the conduct
of Captain Wynne, Lieutenant Doddridge,

With this report at hand Moody will be
able to determine what proceedings are
necessary. If., as reported, one of the
conditions of the release of the men was
their punishment by the United States,
then, of course. It will be necessary to
act. In view of the charges that intoxi
cation "was responsible for the trouble, it
is likely that an application will be made
by the officers themselves for a court of
inquiry. About the time Captain Day

AWAITING EXPLICIT CHARGES,
The bill is brought in the name of the
United States of America, ex rel. Attor
ney General P. C. Knox. The principal
allegation is to the effect that Armour &
Co.. Nelson Morris & Co., Swift & Co..
G. H. Hammond Packing Co.. Cudahy
Packing Co. and Sehwarzschild & Sulz
berger Co., are engaged in an illegal com
bination in restraint of trade, an$ the
prayer of the bill is that they be perma
nently restrained by an injunction. In
support of the main allegation of tne
bill it Is alleged that secret agreements
controlling the price of dressed beef
rxist between the six packers named and
1 hat meetings are held at stated intervals
at which the market price of dressed beef
for tbe entire United States is raised and
lowered at will.
White the lawyers were busy tinishing
the bill word came from the stockyards
lhat by the middle of the month 13,000
men, or one-third of the working force
at the yards, will be out of their jobs.
Tbis information came from the inside- of
the yards and includes not only. the regu
lar summer lay-off of men because of dull
trading and a consequent reduction in the
umountor" manual labor, but aldo several
thousand extra men, as a result of the
present beef agitation. Kvery packing
house in the yards will reduce tne num
ber of its employes. In fact, the process
has been going on for over two we-iits
pa^t. This action has been taken by the
packers in syite of the fact that beef
continues to rise in price and canned
meats will surely follow.
The completion of the bill to-day
marked the ciose of preliminaries to the
injunction suit against the packers and
mates it possible for the bill to be filed
by next Tuesday or Wednesday. All now
depends on the action of Attorney Gen
eral Knox. If he has no changes to sug
gest, his approval will be telegraphed to
Chicago and District Attorney Bethea
will iile copies of the bill immediately.
If the Attorney General has any consid
erable amendments to make to the bill
it will be necessary to send it back to
Bethea for corrections before it can be
liled.
CHICAGO, May 2.â William A. Day,
special attorney of the Department of
Justice, left Chicago for Washington this
evening- to submit to Attorney General
Kqox a bill for an injunction against the
companies. comprising the packers' trust.

manner in which the .various cities aro
providing for the accommodation of the
children. He spoke of the splendid build
ings erected throughout the East, and ad
vocated that similar bulidlngs be provided
for the local School Department. .
School Director Thomas P. Woodward
followed, and stated that the School Di
rectors have not been able to do all the
things the teachers wduld like them to do
and they would like, to do owing to -the
lack of funds. He said the members of
the board were aware of the poor accom
modations, but they could not better con
ditions. Â¦ 'Â»'.Â» Â¦Â¦.;Â¦â¢. .
Â¦. .'/The Auditor's task," he said," "Is not
for the want of a few dollars let her schools
be ruined and set herself back educationally
half a, century? Progression or retrogres
sion, that Is the question.
I confess that it hurts my pride to have
to say these thincs, but the people and the:
teachers of this department, must realize "the
true state of affairs, and the sooner concerted
action Is brought into play for more and bet
ter schools, for smaller classification, not to
exceed forty-five â¢ children enrolled, and for
more and better rtald teachers, the sooner will
we reach thÂ» ideal in education. We havj
not in San Francisco a single modern up-to
date - fireproof school building of steel and
stone construction. Â¦ -. . -
The. public and the Supervisors must realize
that most of our school buildings are going to
seed and ire In need of immediate repairs;
that we must have new schools In new dis
tricts that have none at present; that we
must have more teachers, Â¦ both to reduce the
classification to a reasonable number end to
keep pace with thg natural increase, and that
for these and many more reasons, and because
we cannot wait for a bond issue, which will
take toolontr, as special emergency tax will
hav* to be levied this year, an increase, which
I believe, every honest tax payer but the miser
and tax dodger will gladly approve. ,
The conditions v/e face to-day are th*Â» re
sult of years of neglect. We must have clean,
bright, cheerful schoolrooms and joyous and
enthusiastic teachers, and this influence on
our rlalnar reneration -will give us an Ideal
citizenship advanced, in all the arts and sci
ences, and leaders in the world's progress.
â¢The people and the Supervisors . must be
made to understand above all that in the edu
cation of the American youth we are molding
the American type of manhood of future gen
eration!". . and they must treat the schools lib
erally in order to make -the American " type
ideal. We murt have more schools and bet
ter accommodations and more teachers, not to
morrow, bMt to-day. , , - '
In conclusion, let me -entreat every friend
of tbe public Â«bools to constitute himself a
committee of one to urge upon the Supervisors
the nftCFFfity for .in increased appropriation. .
The : speaker Â¦ then stated the Auditor
had set apart; the 6um>of . $450,000 as a
eort of a fr6e-for-all scramble - for the
various departments, and whatever, de
partment .could advance â¢ the best right to
a claim on this sum would receive a part
or all of it. -He appealed to the, teachers
to use their individual influence. to secure
at least half the sum for' school purposes.
He next suggested that a series of .where
ases and resolutions be prepared and sent
to the Board of Supervisors " as a memo
rial.-' ' :Â¦....,' v |- .â¢Â¦ : Â¦. ; ... Â¦ -; .,: .- . Â¦ â¢;
Principal ' R.< Faulkner .then read 'Â¦ a set
oi' resolutions .which vw ere, o^n motion of
School Superintendent Reginald Web
ster was next introduced and was given
an ovation. In part he spoke, as follows:
â¢ Our republic during the last sevenyears has
experienced an unDarafleled prosperity in ' its
material conditions. . The 'Dulse beat of this
prosperity- forced through the arteries of trade
and finance has reached this city. .... I am Â¦ in
formed that ; during the coming year twenty
millions of dollars will be Invested in perma
nent improvements in this, city and county
and its population Increased by. the most con
servative estimate 15,000 people. This Â¦ condi
tlan Â¦ of things has found > San > Francisco un
pftpared, educationally at least. I â¢will not
fto Into any further exploitation of "the con
dition of our public school business^ and the
insufficient accommodations and Â¦ school facil
ities. About 20.C00 children of school age do
not attend any school in this city and county.
You know, full well that' if 5 per cent of that
number were compelled to attend "school, there
would be no .seats to accommodate them. â¢' This
is a lamentable condition of affairs.
PUI.SE BEAT OF PROSPERITY.
Cecil Mark, a< member of the Board of
Education, follrtwed. He â¢ created' some
merriment in his speech by saying 'that
Boards of Supervisors came: and went;
that the Mayor, Auditor and' other of
ficers were oirly temporarily in power*
while the teachers remained forever. This
was an insinuation that the school teach
ers, grew old in the service, and he tried
to remove the impression,. by. saying it
was incumbent "â¢ on the members of the
department to secure relief from the Leg
islature. ' Â¦ . . v.
an enviable one. What he has done was
dbne with a sincerity of purpose. He has
your interests at heart, and he informed
me that if you would call on him to-mor

Woodward apologized for the absence of
the Mayor, whom- he 6aid was detained
by- the annual inspection of the Police
Department. "We know where his- heart
is and where his pen will be," said the
speaker. He was interrupted at this junc
ture by Miss Stinson, principal of the

"His heart is here because his wife is

LOS ANGELES. May 2.â The politi
cal feature of the club woman's
convention is the withdrawal to
night of Mrs. Robert J. Burdettc
from the presidential race. This
assures Mrs. Denison's election to that
office, with Mrs. Burdette's chances for
the first vice presidency, excellent. In a
statement which she presented first to a
meeting of the California delegation anJ
then gave to. the pre*ss Mrs. Burdette
said:
At the beginning of the General Federation
presidential campaign I said, in private and in
the columns of the press, in many interviews.,
that Mrs. Denlson of New York was the logi
cal candidate for the presidency, and If shÂ«
would accept the nomination she ought to be
Â«>lÂ«cted. Mrs. Denlson having said positively
tbflt she was not & candidate, ray friends made
ust> of my name, in pursuance of their own
desires,- and, by their loyal and zealous enthu
siasm, have made my -candidacy a factor in
this campaign. But now that Mrs. " Denison
hae announced her candidacy through the col
umns Of the press, I wish it understood, in all
sincerity, that I leave her pathway to the
presidency to the General Federation, so far
ac I am" concerned, unobstructed.
Following the morning session, when an
r attempt made by a Massachusetts dele
: gate to precipitate the color question fell
flat, the club women took a recess to view
the flower parade. Mrs. Lowe rode In a
victoria decorated with 3000 rose* by the
Friday Morning Club.. She was accom
! par.icd by Jessie Benton Fremont, daugh
ter of the Pathfinder, and* attended by
eight outriders In white flannel garb. The
ladies were gowned in gray and carried
parasols of the same-shade.?? '-)Â¦.''
REPORTS BY STATES.
The afternoon session was devoted to
two-minute reports of State presidents,
who told., of the practical work of their
federations. Such announcements as the
establishment of 900 free -traveling libra
ries in. Ohio and the opening of twenty
rest rooms for farmers' wives in Texas
precipitated so much, applause that thÂ»i
presiding officer asked, that it be sup
pressed in order to save time.
A feature not down on the programmo
and which threw the Utah delegation into
a furor was the appearance of Mrs. Char
lotte Ives Kirby to report for that Stat.;.
The Utah president was not present,
whereupon Mrs. Kirby announced that she
was to-represent that official. "Mrs. Eliza
beth K. Royle of Salt Lake City, honorary
vice president of the General Federation,
who was seated on the platform, crawled
on her knees to the president's chair in
order not to attract the audience,- and
begged that the speaker be stopped. Mrs.
Kirby was allowed to proceed, however,
and when the two-minutes were up and
she had been called down twice, she be
gan to repeat. "Let us, then, be up and
doing." The laughter of the . audience
ended the episode.
A Utah delegate arose and declared Mrs.
Kirby was not even a member of the
Utah delegation. Mrs. Kirby. who had
in the meantime sauntered, off to the
pr.ess tent to give out her speech, said she
had been sent by the Governor of Utah.
MRS. ROBERTS A WARCLO0D.
. Utah's delegation believes it has more
than its share of trouble; inasmuch as the
rumor is abroad that Mrs. Roberts, wife
of the Mormon leader, has come to urge
her claims as a delegate. As a balm for
its injured feelings, Utah wants to claim
the office of recording secretary. ~ .
Some of the members appointed at
meetings of State delegations, late this
afternoon for the Important nominating
committee are: Mrs.* St. John Gaffney
of New York, Mrs.' Thaddeus Stanwood
of Illinois, Mrs. Henry Weaver of Ohio,
Mrs. O. A., Granger of Georgia, Mrs. H.
M. Youmans of Wisconsin. Mrs. Ernest
Smith of Delaware, Mrs. Percy Penny
backer of Texas and, Mrs. Greenleaf .. of
California. â¢ ' " '
At these same meetings an effort was
made to promote a new amendment in
substitution forthat recently accepted at
the New York* color conference' by Mas
sachusetts and Georgia representatives,
but afterward rejected by. Massachusetts.
The new amendment originated with Ne
braska, and already has the support oi-
Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Idaho
and Iowa. It provides that, if the New
york compromise fail of acceptance by
the convention, "all future -Applications
on the part of individual clubs for mem
bership in the general federation shall be
made to the State federation and that
qualifications for membership shall be
only such as are provided for admission
to the State federation, except they shall
show no political or sectarian test."
GROWTH OF FEDERATION.
The reports given to-day of the growth
of the general federation In the last two
years are interesting. There have been
admitted 225 new rtubs. three State fed*
erations: and three district federations.
The federation now aggregates 763 clubs,
with a membership of 72,500; four dis
trict federations of 4000 and thirty-nine
State federations of 3275 clubs with a to
tal membership of 211,703.
To-night . Simpson Auditorium was

York on "Association Progress."
To-morrow, there will be five sessions.
In the- morning ''Education" will be con

TE3^.OH:E3K.S TO APPEAL TO THE SUPERVISORS!
WASHINGTON'. May 2.-Secretary Root
is writing to Senator Culberson an ex
planation of the reason why the War De
partment thus far has made no response
to the Senate resolution adopted April 17,
calling for exact and detailed statements
of the cost of the war in the Philippines.
This is answer to criticisms made' by
certain Senators to the effect that the
department was purposely suppressing In
formation on this subject. The Secretary
will show that from the moment it was
received every one of the supply bureaus
of the War Department has been engaged
In collecting material for the answer. The
Secretary had explained to Senator Cul
berson as he thought the great difficulties
connected with the collecting of the in
formation he desired and its compilation
would require the service of a large part
of the clerks in the department for a con
siderable time. The Secretary did not feel
justified in diverting them from their nec
essary regular employment upon the re
quest of a single Senator. As soon, how
ever, as the United States Senate by reso
lution called for the.. information the en
tire- machinery of the department was put
in motion to meet the demand. The diffi
culties In the way of making a satisfac
tory response were enormous, and in
many instances it was found actually im
possible to answer specific- questions by
approximate statements. This is true, not
withstanding the fact' that every one of
the depot and supply officers here and in
the Philippines has been called upon
whenever acquainted with any of the
facts desired.
The editor of the Volcano was sentenced
April 22 last to one day's imprisonment
and to pay a fine of $100 for demanding
the* removal cf the Judge, who had fined
Senor VaJdez. editor of the Miau. $W0

Lately about $8000 of Chambers' money
was missing. -. He wanted to use it -and
could not remember where he had hidden
it. He lives with his nephew, Samuel
Taylor* whose family made an energetic
search to recover the money. This week
they cleaned out an old cellar and found
the cash beneath some jars of preserved
fruit.
For some reason Chambers is unwilling
to turn his funds over to younger mem
bers of the family for safekeeping. When
he dies the entire place will have to be
ransacked to recover money he has se
creted. . . â¢ â¢
Chambers a year ago buried $S00 and
six months elapsed before he could re
call where he had placed it. Last winter
he offered a lady in Yakima City his
cashbox, asking her to invest his money.
She declined and it is almost certain he
then hid it away. He has always been
afraid of banks. At another time he hid
away $6000- in cash, . which was subse
quently found by men digging pestholes.
They knew of his failing and promptly
returned the money.- â¢ . '

In 1S8S Britt became the head of the
publishing company. He was still the
mainspring or" this business when he fell
through a hatchway three floors and
was. so badly hurt as to be unable -to at
tend to his work. He was forced to sell
out at a loss.. One by one things went
wrong.; Finally he fell in with the crim
inal element and in due time gravitated
to the "levee."
Adrian Britt was- the son of a Louisi
ana merchant, who died, leaving an es
tate, of 51,000,000. In 1874 he got control
of the Jacksonville Union. He was an
active spirit in the effort to wrest the
control of 'the State Â° from the Repub
licans. When the Hayes-Tilden cam
paign was at its height Britt's paper
was the most powerful organ in Florida.
At the time the electoral vote of the
State hung in doubt he was looked upon
as holding -the key 'to the situation.
Clarkson M. Potter was a personal
friend of Britt, and the Jacksonville Un
ion conceded the election in the State to
the Republicans. Influence was created
which led to the delivery of the votes
to President-elect Hayes. The result
was that instead of Tilden being elected,
enough electoral votes had been swung
over to Hayes to elect him President by
a majority of one.
From that time Britt'a. career took /a
downward course. His- paper lost pres
tige. He sold it.. went to Washington,
and secured employment in the Govern
ment secret service. Afterward, in New
York he was one ofthe publishers of the
Bankers' Magazine, and In 1884 started
the American Bankers' Mutual. This
failed and he became an advertising
agent of the New York Tribune.
CHICAGO, May 2.â Adrian Britt, at
one s time editor and publisher *of the
Jacksonville (Fla.) Union, and in 1SS8
president of the Lcmo Publishing Com
pany" of Chicago, died at Dunning poor
house Tuesday, The body will be buried
in the potter's Held. Britt was arrested
a sjiort :time ago for drunkenness, bur
his condition Was such that he was re
moved to Dunning.

DR. PIEHCE'S REMEDIES.
When the story of Chinese atrocities
filled the papers and shocked the world,
it was the women who drew the pity and
sympathy of all. Doubtless many a wife
who heard her husband's words of sym-
pathy for these women thonght with a
pang, of the blindness of men to the suf-
fering nnder their very eyes. It is true.
The suffering of women in China was
severe but short. Many a wife suffers
for years with a daily agony of pain, her
nerves shattered, her strength almost
gone, and never hears p. word of sym-
pathy.
To women such as these Dr. Pierce's
Favorite Prescription brings the oppor-
tunity of a new life of health and happi-
ness. It establishes regularity, dries the
drains which weaken women, heals in-
flammation and ulceration, and cures
female weakness. It makes weak women
strong end sick women weil. Accept no
eabstitute for the medicine which works
wonders for weak women.

Spring Medicine.
A Prominent Business Han Saved
Prom Nervous Prostration.'
It Is by true merit, and true merit
alone, that Paine's Celery Compound has
â¢won its wondrous popularity in every part
of the civilized worlcl.
"When all other, medicines fall, when tba
best directed efforts of physicians accom-^
plish but little for the banishing of des-
perate diseases, Paine's Celery Compound
saves Hfe and restores health. ,
It Is natural, therefore, that men and
women saved from the perils and dangers
of nervous diseases, rheumatism, neural-
gia and blood troubles should acquaint
their friendsâ the sick and wellâ of what
was accomplished for them fey Paine's
Celery- Compound. In this way the glad
tidinga oi prompt and effectual cures
have beenspread from day to day to tha
remotest towns and villages, and the
blessed work of life saving progresses in
every direction.
One of the most remarkable cures of re-
cent, years effected by Pairie's Celery
Compound is the case of Mr. "Wyan Nel-
son, president of the Nelson Grain Co. of
Kansas City. Mo. With intense gratituda
and thankfulness Mr. Nelson writes a3
follows:
"I was nervous, despondent, irritable,
had no appetite, could not sleep and had
night sweats. My physicians said I_ was
threatened with nervous i/rostratlon, anJ
advised a rest from business. However,
on the recompaendation of my partner, I
commenced using Paine's Celery Com-
pound, and to-day I am as sound as a
dollar, eat well, sleep well and am not at
all nervous."

There is no danger of any suffering, but
the Bhortage Is prompting all to buy, and

The highwayman ordered the merchant
and his clerk into the cellar and ; gave
them instructions to stay there -under
penalty of - death If either attempted to
climb out. He waited some time for the
bookkeeper, but the latter did not ap
pear. Subsequent investigation -, brought
out the fact that the bookkeeper had not
been thoroughly, . aroused, and while .he
was wondering. whether. or not he should
arise he went >, to sleep again. i. Â¦ : - . ,
The highwayman then compelled Bol

to dress and join; them. -He was marched
to the store wjth Bollin. -The clerk, too,
protested his ignorance of the , combina

keeper only. The robber was a determined
fellow, for he made 'the . two men march
ahead of. him i to- the 'Â¦ home of the book
keeper, who ; was awakened and i told* to

then, marched back to the, store to wait
for. him. Â¦Â¦ -, :
.About 1 o'clock this morning Bollin was
awakened by a rapping on his front door
and was told that Constable Stingley
wanted to see him. at his store, as there
was something wrong. Bollin hurried into
his clothes and started S for the store.
Whan about half way thither he was sud
denly stopped by a masked man with a
revolver, who told him to lead the way to
the, store and there to open the safe. Bol

to go. At the store the highwayman
made numerous - threats, but Bollin' s
nerve held out and he protested vehe

ST. PETERSBURG, May 2.â The insti

so many strangers as will come and go
during carnival week.
The wire was strung to-day from the
Western j Union office to the ' grandstand,
where the fiesta will be formally opened
gala attire has been commenced. The
bandstand across the street> also is re

Early this morning linemen began "string

Captain George E. Leslie registered at
the Occidental Hotel from Boston on
March 26 of this year. He remained there
until April 3 and later returned and stayed
at the hotel from April 15 to 17. Ho
claimed that he was formerly an officer in
the army and that he had seen service in
the Philippines. A few days before he
left the Occidental for the last time he
exhibited a large sum in gold. A few
nights ago the police took -a supposedly
forged check to the clerks of the hotel
and compared the .writing with Leslie's
signature on the hotel register. There
was a close resemblance. ;.*Â¦Â¦>,>.; Cf
I am amazed at the reporU I have received
of what has been done on the streets. I
thought that there would be some innocent
fun, but it ne\-er occurred to me that It
would be possible for hoodlumlsm to run
rampant, as I am Informed it did at times on
tprinc street. I have been Informed that the
permit which has been riven has been grocsly
â¢ bused. An order, therefore, will be issued
to the Police Department to stop the throwing
cf confetti en the streets hereafter aad this
cider will be etrlctly observed. It is unfor
tunate that hoodlums should by their actions
naki this course necessary, but from what I
bave learned I am convinced that the peace
of the city and the safety of pedestrian* de
mand the rigid enforcement of the ordinance.
In addition to the objectionable con
fetti throwing a variety of Instruments
were brought Into use for the purpose of
making noise and annoying pedestrians.
Borne of these instruments, captured by
the police, were found to be extremely
dangerous.
Mayor Snyder said to-day In regard to
the order forbidding the throwing of con
fetti:
Orders were to-day Issued by Mayor
Fnyder that the throwing of confetti on
the streets during the fiesta be stopped
by the police. Hoodlumism ran riot on
the streets last night, and the Immense
crowds were more than the police could
handle. Tens of thousands of people went
out to view the electric illumination and
listen to the band concerts, and the side
walks were packed to the curbing with a
solid mass of humanity, all bent on hav
ing a good time. Twenty policemen were
on duty between Temple and Fifth
streets, but they were helpless against
the mob.
HOODLUMS CAUSE TROUBLE.
The honor of the day. however, rests
with the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Euch a. prodigal use of flowers and the
beautiful and artistic form of their ar
rangement earned for the fire boys the
heartiest applause accorded any of the
divisions. .
The innovation of having a woman for
grand marshal proved a popular one. Mrs.
George L. Cole, who had the place of
honor, was mounted on a handsome black
charger. She wore a stunning riding
habit of black, trimmed in gold, while her
mount was decorated with yellow flowers.
Her aids were twenty young women,
chosen from among the best horsewomen
of Southern California's "Four Hun
dred."
Picturesquely clad v&queros and caballe
rofi headed the Chinese section, lending
a touch of early California life to the pa
rade.
The Chinese section, with its wealth of
color* and the great dragon, attracted
much attention, as did the automobile
section. '
The delegates to the triennial camp of
the Supreme Court of the Independent
Order of Foresters made up one division,
""hey were led by their band and the
prize marching company of the order. Be
hind the marchers came Grand Chief
Oronhyatekha and the other grand of
ficers in carriages.
One of the most elaborately decorated
vehicles was a victoria occupied by Mrs.
Rebecca Douglas Lowe, president of the
General Federation of Women's Clubs,
and Miss Jessie Benton Fremont, daugh
ter of General J. C. Fremont. Mrs. Lowe
was the recipient of an enthusiastic re
ception at every point.
FEATURES OF THE PARADE.
Through avenues of brightly robed
buildings and walks lined by the entire
population of the city for two hours the
parade wended its way to the point of re
view and disbanding. Every detail was
carried out in an orderly and systematic
manner, and not an untoward incident
occurred to mar the perfection of the
tvhole. From the time the grand marshal,
llrs.. George I* Cole, and her charmingly
gowned and splendidly mounted aids
made their start at â¢ Sixth and Main
streets until the fire laddies brought up
the rear and disbanded at First and
Broadway there was continuous applause
for the many beautiful features.

sion of the annual parade of La Fiesta de
las Flores, and it eclipsed ail those that
have gone beforeâ at least that is the
opinion of Los Angeles. Even the bien

their delegates across the continent and

Constable Downing, who returned this
evening after a two days' hunt in Stm
Francisco and Oakland, brought back the
information that Llttell spent the winter
months In Honolulu.
Returning in March, he passed under the
name of Captain George E. Leslie â¢ and
since his return has stopped at the Occi
dental Hotel in .San Francisco and the
Metropole in Oakland. An Oakland young
lady whom be met on the steamer gave
the Constable much information concern
ing him. From her it was learned that
Littell intended going to Portland.

Littel! undoubtedly came to Suisun to
conduct hl3 line of business on an exten
sive scale, but before he could carry out
bis plans he was recognized by a' local
resident who had met him in Healdsburz
two years ago. When Llttell learned that
he was known he took a hasty departure.
Answering a hurried summons to meet
his New York attorney in San Francisco,
Littell gave Edwards a worthless sight
draft on the National Shoe and Leather
Bank' of New York in payment for $30
advanced. An answer to a telegram to
that institution revealed the true charac
ter of the stranger, and as a result a war
rant was issued charging Llttell with ob
taining money under f alse pretenses.
During his brief visit here Llttell spent
money freely and ended by contracting
for the purchase of Robbins* 900-acre or
chard for $300,000, the deal to be closed by
May 1. Before leaving, however, he ar
ranged for the expenditure of an addi
tional (40,000 on Improvements on tha

SUISUN, May 2,-George E. Leslie, who
styled himself George E. Llttell and posed
as a New York millionaire* came to Sul
sun on April 4 and registered at the Ar
lington Hotel. The next day he visited
"W. H. Edwards, manager of the Hatch
orchard in Suisun Valley, owned by K. D.
Bobbins. Edwards had met Llttell while
in New York a little over a year ago and
journeyed homeward across the continent
in the tatter's company. Llttell' s gentle
manly demeanor and his display of many
credentials convinced Edwards that tha
man was all he claimed.

The charge of perjury against Robert
Shenson was dismissed by Judge Cabaniss
yesterday. He was. accused on complaint
of his fatber-in-Iaw, A. Muller, S41 Clem
entina street, with falsely swearing be
fore "Cupid" Danforth on September 26
last, while procuring a marriage license to
marry his daughter Ida, that he was 21
years of age, whereas he was only 20.
The young couple had only been married
a few months when they - separated and
â¢divorce proceedings are now pending.
The Judge, in dismissing the case, said
that although he could not invoke legal
authority for doing so still he had very
nigh dramatic authority for such a course.
The defendant, in stating that his age was
21, did not wrong any one, hs it was
known to his intended bride, and to all in
tents and purposes he simply told a lie.
He deprecated the spirit shown by the
young wife In trying to send her husband
to the penitentiary. '...'.,' :

The Academic Athletic League officiate
have decided to hold their annual tennis
matches on the California Club- courts
May 17 and 24. The singles. will be played
on the former date and the doubles on tlfcj
latter. Heretofore both singles and
doubles have been played on tne - same
day, but an unusually large entry list Is
expected this year and it will be Impossi
ble to finish both tournaments on the
same day. For the last three, years Low
ell High School has carried orf . the hon
ors with such ease that little interest was
shown In the matches.. This year Lowell
will be considerably, weaker, and as some
of the other schools have much stronger
representatives than last year It would be
a difficult matter to pick the winner. Al
Rosenberg j is easily the best player in
the league, and. if his partner, Gardner,
had not left- Lowell 'that school would
have won this year as easily as last. The
latter's place will be taken by Beyfuss, a
much- weaker man. Some of the schools
have already picked their teams and will
be as follows: Lowell â Rosenberg in' sin
gles and I Rosenberg and Beyfuss : !n
doubles; Polytechnicâ Geary In singles and
Geary and Mann in doubles; LickâGor
ham In Blnglesand Gorham and Walker
In doubles. Other schools that will lie
represented are Boone's, Hitchcock's,
Alameda High, Berkeley High, Oakland \
High, St. Matthew^3,t Napa High, Bel
mont and Central High. Each " school
will be represented by one man In* singles
and one team in doubles. An, effort is be
ing made to get medals . for the , tourna
ment winners, as in previous years. â¢
The exhibition matches to have' been
played by the local experts to-day and to
morrow at Penryn were called off at the*
last moment.
The 1 public courts have proved 'a "much
greater success than was expected, and
in spite of the fact that ten are already
down it has become necessary to build
more \ to accommodate all SS the i players.-
Two courts are being constructed at pres
ent, one Of which will be of bitumen and
will be used or exhibition matches.
The ; winner of each of the classes will
receive a silver challenge cup to be won
three times. Only those^ who entered the

while Rbuth is one of the strongest ot

nament Allen carried off the honors ot
the first class quite easily, but he will
have to play his best to win this time: '.
In the second ciass thirty-two men en
tered and eignt are; still in the fight. The
matches: win be as follows: Marr vs.
Griflin, Stapff vs. Campbell, James vs.
Finnigan and Brady vs.' Reading. These
players are all evenly matched and will
undoubtedly furnish some gopd sport.
Marr and Griffin are the strongest play
ers and one of them will surely figure in
the final match.

It is most gratifying to air patrons of
the game to note how few kicks are be

It is a singular fact that the captains
of the Oakland, San Francisco and Los
Angeles nines all play third base, and
all are good men in their positions.
The American League, with all its
stars, does not seem to draw any better
crowds than the old tottering National.
Considering the salaries the former is
paying, it does not look so much like a
young mint as many seemed to think.
Comiskey has a young giant named
Jwewlin with his white sock aggregation
who promises to develop into a second
Rusie. Though only 19 years old, he is
over six feet tall and weighs nearly 200
pounds. He has a world of speed, and
if any one can develop him Clark Grif
fith should be the man. Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢-' '
Lajoie is having his share of troubles
In trying to find a place where he can
play ball without having the lawyers and
juages butting in and spoiling his plans."
Perhaps he will compromise and hie him

served. At about 8 o'clock an adjourn
ment will be made to the main hall to

which will be a farce.
On account of the large number of
members and the comparatively small
capacity of the clubroom only those hav

ing performance. Invitations have been
sent to the commodores and secretaries
of the San Francisco, California,- Encinal

As the time for the Perpethal cup race
V is drawing near it has been found neces-
V=ary to hold the first trial of speed be
tween the sloops Presto and Harpoon to
morrow. The second will take place on
Saturday, May 10, and the third on Sun
day, May 1L The boat which wins two
out of the three trials will be selected as
the defender of the Challenge cup, and
will be put on the ways at once to get her
into the best possible trim for the race.
The racing length of the Harpoon Is now
32.18 feet and her owners say that they
can get her down to 33 feet without al
tering her sailing qualities at all. The
Harpoon has not yet carried racing- sails.
After the Corinthians have settled which,
boat shall defend the Perpetual cup the
regatta committees of the San Francisco
and Corinthian clubs will meet and settle
the details of the race, which will take
place on May 24, or possiby on May 31, tha
last of the sixty days since the receipt of
the challenge from the San Francisco
Yacht Cub on April 1. The Corinthians
desire to have ae longr a time as possible
â¢within which to get the defender, into trim
and to train her crew. Frank Stone will
Ball the Presto and Fred Cook the Har
poon.
To-morrow the California Yacht Club
will hold its annual dinner race, open to
all yachts on the roll. Working sails only
will be used, and the course will be fif
teen miles, including two beats to wind
ward and two runs. Hitherto the dinner
race has been sailed over a triangular
course, but the course has been changed
in order to increase the interest of the
spectators, who In previous years saw the
competing yachts only twice, at the start
and the finish, the craft being too far
away to be watched during the Interval.
Under the present arrangement the
yachts will come up to the mole at the
end of the first run and will finish at the
same place. The time limit is four hours.
The South Bay Tacht Club will hold its
opening cruise to-morrow,' starting from
AIvlso at 10 in the morning. The number

proved since last year. Commodore H.

evenly divided In each round.
The fight wsb conceded to be the clean

well received by the audience. Two pre

rise, but the gong sounded just In time to
save him. . â¢ * " v -,
It was several minutes before he was

severe drubbing and Weinlg's defeat was
after a display of sameness rarely
equaled in the prize ring.
Twice in the sixth round he was knocked
to- his knees by Choynskl' s hard rights
and lefts to the jaw, but each time he
came up ready for more punishment. He
was too dazed; however, to defend him

work." '..' :Â¦â¢.:Â¦Â¦.

SAN FRANCISCO.
The Ponies became busy and. ham
mered out two runs in the fourth. Then,
just to sustain interest and incidentally
to make himself -solid with Morley, Han
nivan hit It out of the lot while the
southerners were lamenting on the bags
because 'two had been called out. The
Ponies went- to It again in the seventh,
aided by two cushion punches by Nor
dyke and Leahy, and - Hanlon's error of
Holly's easy pop fly.
In the eighth both were made glad with
another tally, and it was aces up ah
around. The ninth was played without
any balloons arising. Bobby McHale
opened- round ten for the locals with a
clean single past short. Bone sacrificed
him as far as second, and Nordyke's
fourth hit put an end to all the fun and
made Uncle Henry a happy man, for Mc-
Hale was on the spot with the run which
counted most.
Lawler made a spectacular catch of
Hanlon's long drive In the eighth. The
little chap did the turn with one mitt and
robbed Hanlon of a two-bagger. It was
really a mean thing to do, for Hanlon
needs base hits as badly as some peopl*
need the money.
Nordyke did some fine stunts with the
ash. Out of five times at the stand he
secured two doubles and as many singles.
There might have been a different talÂ«>
to tell had not Reilly and Hanlon made
bad errors in tight places, but the crowd
received all that was due and nobody had
anything disagreeable to say except
Morley. .He felt sore and was not so
much to' blame. The score:
IT all happened In the second scene
of the tenth* act of a little comedy
drama written by one James Morley
and entitled "Oh! "What a Shame!"
It was a measly shame, and for two
reasons: Snowball McPartlln was as ag
gravating and as effective as ever, and
Hannivan cleared the fence with a wal
lop when every base was decorated with
an Angrel. Still the southern land did
not land in the limit and the Ponies
packed off the bulky end of .the 6 to B
package. - . . V . .
It was the strenuous artlcle.m'om â¢ thÂ«
drop of the hat. Several kinds of fancy
ball were crowded into the struggle, ' in
cluding good pitching, rank errors and
blood-curdling catches. It swayed from
one side to the other, and both sides had
eever"al ! chances to be It until the last
batch of fireworks was exploded. All the
fans and those who were not fans, but

Professor Burr's address was directed mainly to

the commission gives eight years for the completion
of the Nicaragua and ten for the Panama canal, but
these figures ought .to be changed. Among the
statistics were the following: Excavation, 98,000,
000 cubic yards for Panama, 228,000,000 for Nicar
agua; amount' of iron and steel, 33,000 tons for Pan
ama, 40,500 tons for Nicaragua; number of curves,
on Panama route 29, on Nicaragua route 56; length
of curves, . for Panama 23 miles, for Nicaragua 49
So much has been said by Senator Morgan and
others. about the defective title to the Panama route
it is somewhat surprising to note that Mr. Morrison
contends that the' Panama title is the better of the
two. On that point he says: "The Panama position is
legally. in a "much clearer light than is the Nicaragua
position. It has an absolute quitclaim from any one
who has. any rights there, but all they have at
Nicaragua . is the assurance of the Government that
it has forfeited certain rights which had been granted
but never have been used." . '
The points of superiority on the part of Panama
are, first; that the toute is so much the shorter, that
a vessel can pass it in one-third of the time
required to go through the Nicaragua route; sec
ond, the Panama canal will cost less than the other,'
and, finally, as Mr. Morrison put it: "The Panama
canal, taking up a narrow portion of the isthmus, will
not interfere in any way with the countries on either
side. It is, simply the occupation of a line of transit,
which ' can be kept entirely , free from international
complications. As the Suez canal is the recognized
boundary between Asia and Africa, so the Panama
canal should be the recognized boundary between
North and South America."
PROFESSOR WILLIAM H. BURR and
George S. Morrison, members of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, recently addressed the
Massachusetts Reform Club and gave their reasons
for preferring Panama to Nicaragua as a route for
the isthmian canal. Mr. Morrison, who was the
principal speaker, stated that twenty years ago the
construction of a canal at Panama would have been
so expensive that it would have been desirable at that
tUne to choose the Nicaragua canal, bur that is no
longer the situation. "The changes which have
taken place* in the merchant marine," said he, "have
been so rapid that while Nicaragua might have been
a good substitute at that time, it could not be so
now." - %

The evil effect of undesirable immigration is in
creased by the fact that it affects those who most,
need protection from it. American labor in the
struggle for existence is brought into direct compe
tition with the new corners, who are willing to con
tinue in this country the low standard of life and
wages to which they were accustomed at home. It
is nothing more than justice to the American work
ingman that he should be freed from that kind of
competition. A better system of immigrant re
striction is therefore one of the imperative duties of
the time. â¢ : .
Upon that phase of the question the report says:
"The existing immigration .law prohibits the landing
of paupers who are likely to become a public
charge; idiots and insane persons; persons suffer
ing from loathsome or dangerous contagious dis
eases; persons who have been convicted of a felony
or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygam
ists; prostitutes, and persons who ""are assisted by
others to come here. But, notwithstanding those
provisions, a glance through our charity reports, a
visit to our asylums, our hospitals, our police courts
and our prisons discloses the alarming fact that a
kirge majority of the victims are the product of the
too careless enforcement of our laws and of *a grow
ing remissness of our nation's rights." '
Of course there is no objection now any more than
in the past to desirable immigrants. As the report
says: "The advantages of the immigrant to the re
public cannot be overestimated. It has but begun
to develop our vast and unoccupied domains, and the
State of Texas alone, if as thickly settled as Massa
chusetts, would contain a population of 50,000,000."
The objection runs, then, not against immigration it
self, but to the coming of unfit persons who add to
the pauper and to the criminal population, or, if
above that grade, are still an evil element in the com
munity, by reason of the fact that they underwork
American labor and tend to bring down the standard
of American life to the level of Eastern or Southern
Europe.
The report directs attention again to the change
that has come over the character of the migration
from Europe to this country. In times past the
great bulk of the immigrant population readily,
blended into the composite of American life, but
now, says the report, "the solution has become super
saturated and a discoloration of American life, lan
guage and manners has commenced." In former
times it required the energy of enterprise to come
to America, and an expenditure of money, time and
endurance was the price of immigration; but now
"five or six days in an express steamship, and per
haps a prepaid passage, or at most a ticket for from
$12 to 18, is about the only cost of admission to the
United States." Then we had few cosmopolitan
cities, but now we have foreign colonies in all our
large cities, and the immigrant, if of a low character,
is kept absolutely away from all Americanizing in
fluences.
WHILE Washington authorities are seem
ingly giving little or no attention to the
immigration f problem, the people of New-
York, noting the great stream of immigrants from
Southern and Eastern Europe that is flowing
through their city, arc making vigorous efforts to
bring about a more effective system cf restriction
upon undesirable immigration. Recently the Repub
lican Club of New York published a carefully pre
pared report on the subject, which ably demonstrates
the inefficiency of the existing laws and the impor
tance of the issue to the public welfare.

In this connection it is worth noting that the dis
cussion of the responsibility of the beef trust for the
high price of beef has led to a' careful calculation of
the amount of beef controlled by the trust," and while
the figures may not be strictly reliable they are at
least interesting. The National Provisioner says:
"There are killed in this' country about 11,000,000,
cattle, including calves; about 5,000,000 of these are
'killed at the fifty odd; official>orTinspected*abattOirs,
while about 6,000,000 are killed at the' other 900 un
official abattoirs and by farmers and small slaugh
terers all over this country. The whole of the cattle
and calves as well as the hogs "and sheep slaughtered
by the five packers in question are killed at the Gov
ernment inspected abattoirs, : and are among the
5,000,000 head given out by the Secretary of Agricul
ture as our official slaughter. 'Assuming that the
five concerns cited kill 3,000,000 of the total, there,re
main the other 2,000,000 and the 6,000,000- of outside'
cattleâ 8,000,000 head in all â to - hit the market in
competition. With so much >beef and veal for com
petition the outside concerns would kill -any such
combine if.it existed."
If -the figures stated are reliable it is evident the
Complaint against the trust is urifouhded. It is fur
ther to be .borne in mind that' there was a heavy
shortage in the corn crop last year, and consequently
the farmers did not raise so many beeves as usual for
the market. In any event there is no reason for any
excitement over the matter. We. have only to'con
serve the pastures of the West that are now being
ruined and provide for irrigation of the arid lands, to
provide us with a supply of beef ample for our own
needs and extensive export for generations to come."
After giving .those figures the bulletin goes on to
say: "No reports were secured concerning the value
of animals not on farms and ranges. They probably
have average values somewhat greater than the ani
mals on farms and ranges, since'the greater number
are located in the States having" the highest average
values for animals on farms. the same
average values, however, the animals not on farms"
have a value of $215,192,928. It is probable, there
fore, that the domestic animals in the United States
June 1, 1900, had a value of at .least $3,200,000,000, of
which amount the value of animals^ on farms and
ranges constituted over 93 per cent."
Â» The gain of course was far from being uniform
throughout the census' divisions of the country. : In
the North Atlantic division the value of livestock
declined from $313,902,564 to $305,360,856/ or 2.8 per.
cent. This decrease was caused by losses in the num
ber of neat cattle, horses," sheep and swine, the in
crease in average values and in the/number of other
animals having been insufficient to balance the same.
In .the South Atlantic States the value increased from
$161,631,801 to $184,152,273, a gain of 13.9 per cent;
in the North Central States, from $1,195,704,262 to
$1,529,975,317, a gain of 28 per cent; in the South
Central States, from' $392,155,328. to. $598,255,687, a
gain of 52.6 per cent; and in "the .Â¦Western State's

A summary of the numerous detailed tables "of
statistics contained in the report, shows that on -June
1, 1890, the value of all livestock on farms in the
United States was reported as $2,208,767,573. ..The
estimated value of all livestock on'ranges was $100,
coo,ooo, making the total 'for farms, -.; and ranges
$2,308,767,573. The corresponding^ total on June 1,

As an instance of the political methods
employed in North Carolina, Pritchard
asserted that an emissary of the Demo
cratic party from the State had ap
proached him, promising that If he
(Pritchard) wc.uld have entered a nolle
prosequi in certain cases of election frauds
the proceedings of impeachment of Re
publican Judges by the Democratic Legis
lature would be dropped. Pritchard saiu
he indignantly declined the proposition
and that subsequently the brave and pa
triotic members of the Legislature, Demo
crats and Republicans, by their votes, had
prevented the unjust impeachment of the
Judges. In reply Simmons asserted that
the man who approached Pritchard with
the proposition to drop the impeachment
proceedings was not in the remotest way
an emissary of the Democratic party.
"I state," declared Simmons, "upon my
authority as a Senator and as chairman of
the Democratic Executive Committee,
that the stories of outrages committed
by "red shirts' are absolutely and utter
ly without foundation. I know of no out
rage that can be traced to that organiza
tion."
â¢ "Does my colleague say," Inquired Prit
chard, "that the "red shirts' did not run
through the State and terrorize voters?"
"That organization" (the red shirts), re
plied Simmons, "never had for It3 object
any bellicose or belligerent purpose
toward any. part of the voters of North-
Carolina. It is merely an organization for
more effectually organizing the voters of
the State." (Prolonged laughter on the
floor and In the galleries.)
Pritchard asserted that the "sand cure"
was used by Democrats in North Carolina
on Republicans. He said that a Repub
lican voter was taken from. hl3 home at
night and beaten, his face being- crushed
into the sand to stifle his cries. Simmons
declared that this was the first time he
ever had heard of the "sand cure." Prit
chard inquired if it was not a fact that
organized bands of ."red shirts" rode over
the State of North Carolina for the pur
pose of terrorizing the Republican voters.
"If we retain the Philippine Islands,"
said he, "as we will, the Southern States
will retain the bulk of the trade with the
Philippines and the South will be the
chief beneficiary of the extension of the
cotton goods trade in the Orient."
Pritchard said he was in favor of the
prompt and speedy punishment of those
guilty of cruelty in the ' Philippines, but
the charges had nothing to do with this
measure, Â»which provided merely for a
civil administration in the Philippines.
"That is true," replied Pritchard, "but
the paper opposed him purely on the issue
of free silver." s
"Does not the ; Senator know." inter
rupted Simmons, "that the Charlotte Ob
server opposed the election of "William J.
Bryan to the Presidency?"
Â¦WASHINGTON, May 2.â A lively debate
was precipitated in the Senate to-day by
Pritchard of North Carolina by some re
marks he made on political methods in
North Carolina in the, course, of a discus
sion of the Philippine bill. Simmons, also
of North Carolina, vigorously denied his
colleague's assertions.
The Rosebud Indian Reservation bill
and the sundry civil bill were again con
sidered, but. not completed.. The Philip
pine government bill then was laid before
the Senate and Pritchard spoke in sup
port of the measure. He declared that a
majority of the people of North Carolina
and of the South were in favor of the
proposition of the majoritv of the Philip
pine Committee and he quoted the Char
lotte Observer as a leading Democratic
paper of the South In support of the re
tention of the Philippines.
..Mexico and Austria ha've made up after being very
bad friends since 1867. , It is strange how the big
quarrels of, some nations' are' so? little-, to' the. rest of
us. : The busy 'world appears to have known little of
and to have cared, less for' the' fight which" these two
interesting countries' have maintained so long.
It is to be borne in mind that appeals for contri
butions for enterprises of this kind go out to the
whole body of the community and not to any special
class. Local members of the Knights of Pythias^ and
of the Mystic Shriners have in" the past contributed
to .the entertainment of other fraternal orders, and
now members of all other orders are bound to sliow
a reciprocity of favors. As to the work of the Pro
motion Committee, it is to benefit every class of peo
ple. The attraction of investors and settlers to the
northern counties of the State will increase the ac
tivity and the prosperity of every industry and every
trade in San Francisco. All citizens are to share in
the benefits to flow from it, and all, in proportion to
their means, should share in the expense of carrying
it on.
We cannot afford of course to drop all thought of
the St. Louis exposition by reason of the postpone
ment, but still our main consideration must be given
now to the immediate needs of the year. The sub
scriptions to the Promotion Committee should be
promptly raised to the amount required to put the
work of advertising the Stare into effective opera
tion without delay, and the sums needed for the en
tertainment of the Mystic Shriners and the Knights
of Pythias should also be forthcoming at once. The
sooner the amounts required are raised the better
will the work be done.
There is certainly enough for us to do during the
present summer, without rushing the. work for a
State display at a world's. exposition next year. We
have entered upon "a great movement for the up
building of Northern California, and that will require
the expenditure /of 'considerable sums of money and
a great deal of energy. Furthermore, we have to
entertain during the summer a host of visitors whose
numbers it is estimated will exceed 100,000. That in
itself is a task of first rate importance and cannot be
treated in a scant or hesitating way.
The postponement of the exposition will not jus
tify Californians in wholly neglecting this summer
the work of making preparations for a grand- State
display, Â¦â¢ but it will nevertheless save us from the
trouble of making preparations in a rush, and thus
allow us to devote more of our energies to the work
undertaken for the promotion of the counties north
of Tehachapi and the attraction of immigration to that
section of the State. We therefore will derive bene
fits from -the postponement and have no reason to
regret that it has been decided upon. More time has
been given us to" make preparations, and if we make
the right use of it the results will be greatly to our
advantage.
The delay is no discredit to the energy of the peo
ple of St. Louis. It is the inevitable result of their
determination to prepare an exposition on a scale of
unprecedented magnitude. Had they been content
with such an array of buildings and exhibits as. were
comprised in the Columbian Exposition at Chicago
the work might have been accomplished within the
time fixed. St. Louis, however, was animated by
the spirit which prompts Americans to surpass all
previous efforts of the kind and to. break records.
She planned her exposition on a truly gigantic
scheme, and, having done so, has to accept the con
sequences. It is certainly better in enterprises of
such magnitude to take'the time required to do them
well rather than to hurry them forward and present
them to the public in an incomplete shape.
OFFICIAL? announcement of the postpone
ment of the St. Louis., exposition to 1904
comes as no surprise to the public. It; is
true the managers have from time to time declared
that St. Louis could have the buildings in readiness
for the installation of exhibits at the date fixed, and
would do so as a demonstration of American en
ergy, but all reports of the conditions of the grounds
and the lagging of foreign preparations for taking
part in the display have prepared the country for
the announcement which has come at last. ' The ex
position cannot be made ready on time and the
postponement has been decreed.

Representative Naphen of Massachu
setts to-day introduced a resolution re
citing that it is publicly alleged that pub
lic lands are leased to members of the
meat trust, and directing the Secretary of
the Interior to furnish information rela
tive to lands so rented.
He also attacks the provision of the bill
fixing the rental of the leased lands at 2
cents per acre. He declares that the gen
eral effect of the bill would be to place
the control of the public lands in the
hands of the extensive stock growers,
with the corresponding result of making
the small owners pay tribute to their
more prosperous fellows or go out of the
business.
Herrman says that under the terms of
the bill practically all the public lands
west of the Mississippi would be subject
to leasing, and that as it is provided
that when under the lease they shall not
be disposed of except under the home
stead and mineral . land laws the sale of
the public domain would be greatly cur
tailed.

Mott had not concluded his testimony
when the committee adjourned until Mon
day.
Senator Platt â Suppose there . should be a
reduction of Cuban sugar duties, would the
buyer get the full benefit of it or any part
of it?
The witness â The buyer would not get any
part of the benefit. The reduction would not
make any difference in the purchase price.
The benefit would accrue to the Cuban sellers,
the holders of the sugar. The experience with
the Porto Rlcan sugar, which comes in free,
Justifies that conclusion.
"I have not," vaa the reply.
' Senator Platt â So far as you know, has the
American Surar Refinlnn Company taken any
interest whatever in forwarding or opposing
the reduction of the duty on Cuban sugar?
"No, sir. I don't think it has."
Senator Teller â You speak of 'it as a corpo
ration?
"Ye*."
"Do you know whether, the stockholders
have taken any interest as such in the reduc
tion?"
"I do not: I know nothing about it." . ,
Henry C. Mott, purchaser of raw sugar
for the trust, was the next witness. He
said he had acted in that capacity for the
past five years and that he buys all the
raw sugar for the company, except Louis
iana sugars. He confirmed previous state
ments that the trust had bought 93,000
tons of Cuban sugar since January 1.
"You have taken some interest in securing
a reduction of sugar duties by Congress, have
you not?" asked Teller.
WASHINGTON, May 2.â Arthur Donner,
treasurer of "the American Sugar Refining?
Company, to-day testified before the Sen
ate Committee on Cuban Relations con
cerning American holdings, of Cuban
sugar. He said that Havemeyer's state
ment yesterday to the effect that his com
pany had purchased 93,000 tons of sugar
since the first of January last was cor
rect. No more Cuban sugar could have
been bought," as none could have been
purchased without his knowledge' as
treasurer of the company. He promised
Senator Platt to send to the committee a
memoranda showing the purchases made
and giving dates. All the sugar which
had been purchased had, he said, been
paid for. \ ,*'
Senator Platt called attention to the dis
crepancy between Havemeyer's statement
as to purchases of 93,000 tons and the re
turns made by the War Department, but
Donner was not able to explain it. Re
sponding to questions by Senator Teller,
JJonner confirmed Havemeyer's statement
that of the trust's purchases of Cuban
sugar 45,000 tons still remain in Cuba.
He also said that his company dealt en
tirely with brokers, ' principally with
Zaldo & Co., Franck & Co. and Czarno
kow & Co. of Havana and New York ana
did not know the names of the producers.
The American Company has made no-ad
vances to the Cuban planters and had not
advanced any money, to the Cuban banks
for the planters. "While he did not know,
he said, he presumed there were other
purchasers of Cuban sugar besides his own
company in the field. Asked as to realty
holdings in Cuba, he said that the trust
had none there. He knew nothing of the
private holdings' of stockholders of the
trust.

'- SAN FRANCISCO "GIRL- AND
m THE -. MAN , SHE IS TO WED
. SHORTLY.
' The annual dinner of the Union League
Club of. California' will .take place this
evening at the xnqple room of the Palace
Hotel. Colonel George H. Plppy. presi.
dent of the club, will preside. After the
feast the oratory will come. Several bril
liant speakers are on the list of talkers.
The State Executive Committee qf the
Allied People's partyâ the new political
organization "formed at Louisville April
2, will meet this; afternoon at G. W.
Montelth's office to prepare a call for a
State convention to be held in San Fran
cisco. _.-. â¢ > : Â¦ :' . . â¢
On the other hand, in the rank and file
of the party;- and among citizens of the
State generally, there is a strong and
openly expressed sentiment that Gage is
simply an Instrument of the bosses â that
he does not deserve a renomlnation and
could not- be elected if renominated. The
Call will keep the people posted concern
ing movements in the boss camp.
Duncan E. â¢ McKinlay, Assistant United
States District Attorney, and well-known
campaign orator, la the latest addition to
the list of Republican aspirants for nom
ination to the office of Attorney General.
To block this game the>-People must
elect delegations ; that cannot be handed
over to the bosses. Let every candidate
for a place r on the State ticket stand on
hi3 own i merit. To further check the
game of the bosses the chairman of . the
convention : should be chosen by general
voice of the people. Let the, bosses name
in the open their secret candidate for
chairman. The - forces opposed to cor
rupt bosslsm have named Hon. Jacob
H. Neffof Placer. '
In the long Senatorial contest The Call
; foreshadowed every Important . movement
in the boss camp, and from the outset as
serted that the bosses could never corral
a sufficient force to make Burns the Sen
ator., Perhaps nine-tenths of the people
of 'the State fancied that the machine
push, backed by the Governor, the rail
road and â¢ the State Committee, would
be able to force the election of Burns,
but the result established the fact that
the bosses were boasting of goods that
they could not deliver. The' Call knows
it to be a fact that the Gage forces are
boasting of strength that they do not
possess. Outside of the appointed State
office-holders and their deputies and em
ployes, the sentiment favorable to Gage
is Slight. < l
INSTRUMENT OF* THE BOSSES.
HOW TO BLOCK THE GAME.
It is out. of the ordinary line of prece
dence to bring a , candidate Â¦ for chairman
into the open neld before ! the : delegates
are chosen, but the ;: fact Â¦ Is" well known
that the t; bosses in secret-" have "'.desig
nated a man to preside* over, the conven
tion and his name. is. not Jacob H.. Neff.
To checkmate the- bosses the ..people
must put forward a candidate â a man of
sterling integrity Â¦ and firmness Â¦ who can
not be moved by promises, of 'reward nor
threats . of political punishment to take a
boss programme.' - "\"
It is worth while here/ to bring out
some of the concealed history of the. late
municipal campaign in-' San. Francisco.
It Is the truth that" Crlmmins. Burns
and Herrln organized' the convention,
named the officers and designated the
ticket from top to bottom. The dere
gates in a perfunctory style simply cast
the ballot tor each of the candidates
named by Crimmins, Burns and Herrin.
To begin with, the bosses- did not have
a majority of the delegates, but district
leaders who were behind candidates for
Auditor, Treasurer, Tax Collector, Sher
iff, Public Administrator and other of r
flees were made to believe that the only
way to win for their respective candi
dates was to place their delegates at the
disposal of, Crimmins and Burns.' In
that manner a. majority of .the conven
tion was given' to* the oosses. \
The same; game, varied, perhaps in
some respects, will be attempted at the
State convention. The day after the
convention ,the â¢ bosses will shout that
Gage delegates in sufficient numbers lo
dominate the convention have won out.
This claim will be made if the bosses
succeed in electing 100 of the 800 dele
gates. Candidates for - Senator, Gov
ernor, Justices of the Supreme Court,
Treasurer, Controller, Attorney . General,
Secretary of State, Superintendent of
Schools, Surveyor, Clerk of the Supreme
Court, candidates for the Board of
Equalization \ and Railroad Commission
and also Congressional candidates will
be cordially invited 1 to hand over their
delegates to Burns and Herrin. \
The supporters of . E. F. Preston,. Dr.
Pardee, Thomas > Flint, E. B. y Edson, "W.
M. Cutter and Frank Short favor the se
lection' of Lieutenant-Governor Neff for
chairman. - . ; , â¢ ; , . ,
EEADYv TO CHECK THE v BOSSES.
Dan Burns, BillwHerrjri and Ben Feh
nemann will not/n'ame ,the, chairman of
the Republican 'State c6nvention. \ The
question; of the chairmanship - will be set
tled I at the primary election August 12.
The forces opposed to ! machine rule may
hot be able to agree in advance on any
candidate for Governor, "but they will
have no trouble in "combining forces for
the purpose .'of choosing: a man of high
character â¢ for the chairmanship of the
convention. ; : Speaking ..or Hon. .Jacob H.
Neif, Mayor. Eugene E. Schmltz yester
dai remarked: - :.
Governor Neff Is a grand man. He is a pio
neer who has done great j work for the State."

And 1 All Women Who W6rk, either
for tlieir Living or for Society,
are Subject to the Same Organic
Troubles. How Many Are Cured.
v A gorgeous costume flashed beneath the brilliant lights of a ball
room. The queen of society is radiant to-night
The nervous hands of a weak woman have toiled day and night,
the weary form and aching head have known no rest, for the dress
had to be finished in time. /
To that queeji of society and her dressmaker we would say a word.
One through -hothouse culture, luxury and social excitement, and tho
other through the toil of necessity, may some day find their ailments
a common cause. '
Nervous prostration, excitability, fainting spells, dizziness, sleepless-
ness, loss of appetite and strength, all indicate serious trouble, whiph
has been promoted by an over-taxed system.
1 For the society queen and the dressmaker alike, there is nothing so
reliable as Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound to restore
strength, vigor,- and happiness. ,'
Six Years' Suffering Cured.
" Dear Mrs. Petkham : â I suffered for six years, sometimes being -unable
to get about at all. It seemed to me as though I could not live, and I did not
care 'to. I had womb trouble, kidney trouble, leucorrhoe'a, backache, was
nervous and had no ambition to do anything or go anywhere. Was obliged
to give up my trade of sewing. I tried three doctors but they did me no good.
Seeing your advertisement I thought I would try your medicine. I felt better
after the first b'.wtle, and by the time I had taken six I was able to resume my
work again. I shall always praise Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound." â Mrs. JIaby A. Etjssell, Chincoteague Island, Va. (Dec^
14,1900.)
If there is anything in your case about -which you would
like special advice, write. freely to Mrs. Pinkham. No man will
see your letter. She can surely help you, for no person in America
, has such a wide experience in treating female ills as she has had.
She has helped hundreds of thousands of women hack to health.
. Her address is Lynn, Mass., and her advice is free. You are very
! foolish if you do not accept her kind invitation.

Mrs. Lizzie Anderson, 40 Union St., Salem, N.J.
.Â«' Dear Mrs. Pixkham:â I feel it my duty to write and tell jonhtr*-
grateful I am to you for what your medicine has done for me. At one time I
suffered everything a woman could. I had inflammation of the ovaries, falling
, of the womb, and leucorrhoea.' At times could not hold a' needle to sew. The
first dose of your Vegetable Compound helped me so much that I kept on
using it. I have now taken six bottles and am well and able to do my work:
. I also ride a wheel and feel no bad effects from it. I am thankful to the Giver
of all good for giving you the wisdom of curing suffering women. I recom-
mend your medicine to every woman troubled w,ith any of these diseases."

ANOTHER WONDEB OF SCIENCE
Biology Has Proved That Dandruff
Is Caused by a Germ.
Science is doing wonders these days in
medicine as well as in mechanics. Since
Adam delved, the human race has been
troubled with dandruff, for which no hair
preparation has heretofore proved a buc-
cessful cure until Newbro.'s Herpicide was
put on the market. It is a scientific
preparation that kills the germ that
makes dandruff or scurf by digging into
the scalp to get at the root of the hair,
where It saps the vitality, causing itch-
ing scalp, falling hair and finally bald-
ness. Without dandruff hair must grow
luxuriantly. Herpicide at all druggists.
It is the only destroyer of dandruff.

H A training school < for farmers, however, must
teach farming, practically and must' give stu
dents not only a knowledge of farming, but
also a liking forMt. There is no such school
in this State. . The college of agriculture at
Berkeley is , simply a chemical laboratory. It
' graduated last year only one student and that
one graduate was a! young woman, who prob
ably has no .'intention of cultivating a farm
for a livelihood. '
* x SCIENCE OF FABMING.
To know the > constituent elements of ' tha
soil, to understand the special needs of special
plants, to comprehend the value of a rotation
of crops in order to - prevent the exhaustion
of slnKle elements in the land, to study the
signs of the season and regulate the business
of the farm so as to profit most fully by ..win

a successful farmer. â¢-_-'. Â¦ - . .
California farmers have suffered because
many of .them do not know the science of
farming. - A a farm is a profitable Investment
If it is managed with. industry, skill and.In

Â¦France maintains nine - national schools of
agriculture, and connected with each school Is
a well-kept farm in which the students put
their lessons into . practice.' In addition., to
â¢ these national " schools \ there is a ' large - num
ber of intermediate farming schools. ~ There
are I about forty agricultural â¢ Institutes besides,
under the ' control and direction Â¦ of the church.
These schools have popularized farming as a
means of livelihood and have very much Im
proved the farming methods of the French
people. Consequently France has ten millions
of peasant proprietors, while England and Ire
land together nave * less than nine hundred
thousand.
A school like the one proposed should sup
port Itself after the first cost and the ex

It would be worth many thousand dollars each
year to the State of California.

Amos J. Cummings was born in Conk
ling, Broome County, N. Y., May 15, 1841.
Receiving a common school education, he
entered a printing office as an apprentice
when 12 years of age and later set type
in nearly every State in the Union. While j
still a boy he was with Walker in the
last invasion of Nicaragua, s He was ser
geant, major in the Twenty-sixth New
Jersey Regiment of Infantry, Army of the
Potomac, and received a Congressional
medal of honor for gallantry on the bat
tlefield. Later In life he became inter
ested in politics and was a delegate to
the Democratic national conventions In
1S92 and in 1896. He filled editorial posi
tions on the New York Tribune' under
Horace Greeley, on the New York Sun,
New York Express and was editor of the
Evening Sun when elected to the Fiftiqfh
CongTess. Preferring to give his whole
attention to editorial .work, he declined a
renomlnatlon. However, he was elected
to the Fifty-first Congress to fill the-va
cancy caused by the death of Samuel Sul
livan Cox. He was elected to the Fifty
second, Fifty-third, Fifty-fourth 'and
Fifty-fifth Congresses, and re-elected to
the Fifty-sixth Congress.
THE managers, of the Youths*'Di
rectory have issued an appeal to
the people tot California . to aid
them in\ the laudable work of
establishing an agricultural school
for boys. It is the aim Of Rev. Father
Crowley, president of .the directory, which
is opened to abandoned boys of every
race, color and creed, to in the near fu
ture open a school that, will assist poor
youths , in securing: a practical knowledge
of agriculture^ Such a school will be of
great benefit to the entire State and an
enthusiastic commendation of the project
is assured. The Rev. Archbishop P. W.
Rlordan has given his most cordial ap
proval to the Idea of opening . an agricul
tural school, as outlined in the following
circular: .' . .
-' For several .years the idea' has been con
sidered of establishing . an agricultural school
for.-.boys. to be affiliated with the Youths'. -Di
rectory ..and to complete Â¦ or supplement- the
work done by that Institution. ,, This idea has
been .commended .with, peculiar earnestness by
the I press, - both . metropolitan , and rural. I and
by many thoughtful and experienced men who
have watched with dread the tendency of popu
lation toward cities, where environment Is
vicious and who have Joined in the cry "back
to the land." Â¦ â¢.- .-.â¢â¢- . Â¦ 'Â¦
Many promises of pecuniary aid for such a
school have been volunteered. Encouraged by
such promises, Â» by the general enthusiastic
commendation of : the project . and by a strong
conviction that such: a school for boys is need
ed, the managers of the Youths' Directory. have
bonded Â¦Â¦. a fertile tract oÂ£ one thousand acres
In a neighboring county and they now appeal
to the public for the;.money required for the
purchase . of â¢ this land. - ' - % -, ' . Â¦ â¢
OPEN TO ALLCBEEDS.
â¢ The soil Is rich, level, well wooded, well
watered and the farm is â¢ accessible. There
are buildings on the land, which, with- some
alterations, can be adapted to the purposes
of the school. No better bargain of this kind
can be had in the State because the property
is perfectly suited to the requirements of an
agricultural college and .the price Is reason
able. An opportunity Â¦ to secure such a farm
may not come' again and it is hoped that an
ever generous public will give freely the money
required. " ! Â¦ ' ' :â¢'â¢â¢'â¢ Â¦-'Â¦-.
The broad policy which has made the Youths'
Directory a home for abandoned boys of evewy
race, color and creed will guide the i managers
of the farming school,' and for that reason^ this
appeal Is addressed not only to Catholics, ' but
to men and women of every creed. The work
to be done by the new school will redound not
only to the glory of God," but also to the im
provement of citizenship and the benefit of the
r There Is need In California of fanners who
will be at once practical and scientific. .The
drift toward the cltleaimust be counteracted.
Boys are leaving the country and flocking
toward the > crowded- cities Â¦ and towns, where
life Is â¢ artificial â¢ and - where, too - often. Â¦ they
i find bad environments and become vicious. and
e "Back to the land"., must become the shib
boleth of | the coming decade. Agriculture Â¦ Is
the foundation of the country's wealth. ; It Is
the first of the sciences. â¢ The best line that

Judiciary and Police Committee De
cides'to Make Ho Recommendations
; on Proposed Ordinances.
The- Supervisors'. Joint Committee on
Judiciary. and Police yesterday decided to
report back to the board without recom
mendation the proposed ordinances de
signed-to prohibit the playing 1 of card,
games for mdney In any public place
where liquor Is sold. The Chief of Police
and Police Commission â¢ will be invited to
attend the next session of the board to
express their views on the subject.
Supervisor Eggers objected to the or
dinances on the ground that If would pre
vent >aman from playing cards In a gro
cery. Eggera thought the . proposed;
legislation was too sweeping . and that if
it was. aimed at such places as the Cafe*
Royal and the Baldwin Annex It should
be more specific in its provisions.
: Chairman Comte said . the ordinances
- were ' directed against a public evil, but
I the committee held the view that they
would prohibit card games for money ex
cept-In private dwellings. Supervlsor-Mc-
Clellan thought the police would be able
to cope with the evil under the existing
laws. Supervisor Boxton held that no
exceptions should be made and that the
prohibition should tie made general. Su
pervisor Booth said the - measures came
from the Police Commission, which ho
thought was qualified to Judge of the
necessity of , the . legislation. ..,;.â¢; â¢

The members of the Board of Education
took up most of the morning session In
an endeavor to urge an appropriation of
$1,805,000 for the School Department. The
Directors admitted that this amount was
largely in excess of. the charter allow
ance, but they had designated the actual
needs of the department in the hope that
they would get mos,t of them.- Denman
made a defense of the figures on enroll
ment as returned to the Auditor by the
board. He produced figures showing that
on August 24, 1900, there were 40,591 pupils
enrolled, and up to June 7, 1901, new pu
pils had increased the total enrollment to
49 035. Denman held that this meant pu
pils in average daily attendance, and as
$32 50 per pupil the department would be
entitled to $1,534,117 50. The remaining
sum was ' wanted for new buildinga.
Woodward said; When Supervisor^Wllson

' DENVER. : May 2.â Judge Morton S.
Bailejr ">of the Eleventh Judicial District,
sitting at, Canyon: City, has appointed
Heriry L. Doherty receiver of the Denver
Gas and Electric Company 'on application
of Dennis Sullivan, who brought suit
against, the company on a promissory, note
for .$15,000, to which the company'con
fessed judgment. The receiver's bond was
fixed at JUJu.OuO.
Â¦ i Reqetver, Doherty has been president of
the Denver Gas and Electric Company
since May, 1901. and was acting president
from the . preceding October until -that
date. Extensive additions have been mad*
to plants and service of the company dur
ing -.hts incumbency, and the default in
payment of obligations, it Is said, la due
to the fact that bonds. of the company
bearing 5 per cent interest have command
ed only Ti per. cent of face value In the
market, and the officers of the company
have not felt justified In floating them at
that price â¢ to meet the ' current construc
tion expenditures, -which have averaged
about $25,000 per month; .

If the day for battle comes you. will need

without these qualities you can do nothing, yet
even with them you can do but -little If . you

DUTIES OF OFFICERS.
We, all of us. earnestly hope that the occa
sion for war may never come, but if It haa to
come then this nation must win: and the prime
factor in securing victory over any foreign foe
must of necessity be the United States navy.
If the navy falls us' then we are doomed to
defeat, no matter what- may be our material
wealth or the high average of citizenship. It
should, therefore, be an object of prime impor
tance for every patriotic American to see that
the navy is constantly built up, and, above
all, that it Is kept to the highest point of efn
ciency. both in material and In personnel. It
cannot be too 01 ten repeated that in modern
war, and especially In modern naval-war, -. the
chief factor in achieving triumph 19 what haa
been done in the way of thorough preparation
and training before the beginning of the war.,
It Is what has been done before the outbreak
of war that U all important. - After the out
break'all that can. be, done is to use to best
advantage the great war engines and the sea
manship, marksmanship and general practical
efficiency which already have been provide'l
by the forethought of the national Legislature
and by the administrative ability, through a
course of years, of the .Navy Department.
A' battleship cannot be Improvised. Ittakes
years to build, and the, skill of the officers and
crew- In handling it aright can likewise never
be improvised, but must spring from use and
actual sea service and from the moat careful,
zealous and systematic- ' training.- .You,- to
whom I, give these' diplomas,- now Join the
ranks of the officers of. the United States navy.
Tou enter a glorious service, proud of its mem
ories of renown. You must- keep ever In your
minds the thought of the supreme hour which
may come when what you do will forever add
to or detract from this renown. : >,".-.

In the .United States navy. .
The graduating classx . discarded their
guns and accouterments and advanced
close to the platform. President Roose
velt then â¢ addressed them, his ; remarks
being frequently Interrupted by applause.
Following is the President's address:
- ' In receiving: these diplomas you become men
who, abov* almost any others of the entire
Union,. are to carry henceforth the ever-present
sense of .responsibility which must come with
the knowledge that on- some tremendous day
It may depend upon your courage, your pre

livered to him and , according to â¢ instruc
tions from McWilliams, he left them at a
grocery * on Eddy -and . Polk : streets.

Front store, ,857?Market street, but there
the manager became suspicious and,tele
phoned : to police headquarters, detaining

seeks an annulment of . her -marriage -to

Judge Hunt ordered the casccontinuod
until Tuesday at- noon,- when., the. books

Rosenfeld will be produced. . â : â¢
MTJLVEY TO TAKE TESTIMONY.
Louis Rosenfeld. a brother, of the plain
tiff, in an affidavit corroborated the tes
timony of the latter. He said his brother
only got $100 a month, with little prospect
of a raise. .. Â¦ 'Â¦ ' , . , - Â»-v~
"Before I was married I was given
about $800 a year in addition .to my sal
ary. I am very willing to provide for my
children, but not for my wife's extrav
agance. I had between $4000 and $5000 in
the bank when I was married, but it is
all gone, because of her extravagance. â¢ I
was not the only one who got presents of
cash. My wife frequently - received as
high as $600 a year from her relatives."
Max Rosenfeld said in his testimony
that his wife was very extravagant. He
said his salary was only $100 a month,
"but."' he said, "I receive presents from
the firm t amounting to $1100 or $1200 a
year.
MORE MONEY AFTER MARRIAGE
Max gets $250 a month/ but. his father's
books show that he only gets $100. He re
ceives . the rest in "presents" from the
firm, f? n â¢ <
WIFE TELLS OF INCOME.
_The inquiry into the financial affairs of
j X , Rosen feld led to some very, 1 queer
admissions on the part of the young
couple. Mrs. Rosenfeld, who was first
placed on the witness stand, said her hus
band got at, least $250 a- month for his
services, to the John Rosenfeld & Son'*
Co., but that according to tlie books of
the concern he only got $100.
,- He as P aid this way," said the young
w . fe ilx <ln order tnat the' other clerks
m i? nt not be impelled to ask for a raise."
r -Mrs. Rosenfeld then went . on to tell
how she borrowed clothes in which > to
appear in court in a manner befitting a
wife in her position, "who," she said,
should be modestly attired."- I went to
the Emporium a few days ago," she said,
'to order some goods and found that since
the commencement of the suit for divorce
my husband had stopped my credit. I
own the furniture at 2418 Washington
street. That is all I have. I paid a nurse
$20 a month, and a cook $25. I am now
doing my own cooking, and for the first
time, too."
According to Mrs. Rosenf eld's testi
mony their home at 2118 Washington
street has not been a particularly happv
one, and a great deal of the trouble seems
to have arisen over the question of
finances. Young Rosenf eld says- his wife
is extravagant; Mrs. Rosenfeld says she
is not. Mrs. Rosenfeld says she pays $25
a month to a cook, $20 a month to a nurse
and $47 a month house rent. Her husband
says he only gets $100 a month.
"I, borrowed the suit and hat I ...now
have on from afriend in order to appear.
In court in a -manner . befitting: a. wife in
difficulties with- her husband. I have
plenty of gay clothes,' but I do not think
I should wear them on an ' occasion like
this.": / : V â¢.,'.; Â¦ - - .
Mrs. Max L. Bosenfeld, who is being
sued for divorce, made the statement aa
quoted during the hearing of the case in
Judge Hunt's '.court yesterday. Her hus
band is the youngest sbn of John Rosen
feld, the well knovm merchant. Mrs. Ro
senfeld appeared j hi; court to support her
claim for $150 a riionth alimony pending
*}Â£,-} t 1 Â°Â£ th f dlv Â°rce proceedings. Her
voting husband was in court also, smiling
and grinning occasionally, seemingly, tak
ing great delight in the testimony of his,

The report of the United States Weather
Bureau, for the Oregon Crop Bulletin, week
ended April 23, is as follows:
The weather during the week has been ab
normally cool, with light scattering showers
over nearly all sections of the State. With
the exception of a few of the northern coun
ties in the Willamette Valley the rainfall was
not of sufficiently long duration as to seriously
interfere with outdoor work, and plowing and
seeding made satisfactory progress. There has
been considerably more sunshine on the aver
age than during the preceding weeks of the
month and the few warm, bright days have
caused an improvement in the condition and
color of fall-sown wheat.
In the Columbia River Valley work on sum
mer fallow continued uninterruptedly through
out the week and the farmers are well along
with that branch of their work. In the Wil
lamette Valley and Southern Oregon but little
plowing has been done on the low lands on
account of the wet condition of the soil. Fall
Â¦wheat and oats are generally In a promising
condition, and spring wheat, although back
ward in germination and growth, is doing as
â¢well as can be expected, owing to the cool
weather. With the advent of a few bright,
ftjnshiny days a marked Improvement will
take place in the condition of the wheat crop.
Hope are growing nicely and in some of the
earlier yards the vine* are being trained on
the poles. Training will not become general,
however. Jwfore the middle of next week.
Grass and alfalfa have made a luxuriant
growth, and meadows, pastures and ranges are
T'-ported to be in excellent condition. There Is
now plenty of feed for stock on the range, and
in the dairy fectior.f there has beÂ«n a satis
factory increase in the supply of milk. With
the exception of apples, fruit trees all over
the State are now in bloom, and in portions
of Willamette Valley Italian prunes have be
min to set. The outlook is very promising for
en abundant yield of fruit.' Stock continues to
improve, and Fheep shearing has commenced
in some localities, in Lane County, Angora
goats are being sheared.

. It has been a weak market for cereals, good
crop advices deciding ' the "bull" reports of
dry weather In Kansas. .
Wool Is dull at the East, reflecting the cur
tailed consumption and irregularity. Small
stocks at Â¦ Eastern points are a ' steadying ele
ment in view of the lack of demand, but at
the West buying is heavy, at slightly higher
prices than a year ago.
With the exception noted, agricultural opera
tions have made good progress and weather
conditions have been in the main favorable,
particularly In the eastern portion of the win
ter wheat belt, to the oats crop generally, in
the newly planted spring wheat sections and
In the larger part of the cotton belt. ,
More seasonable weathe'r over wide areas has
helped distribution at retail points. Exceptions
to this are found In some portions of, the South
west, where lack of "rain affects crops, ana
also in portions of the Northwest, where the
reverse is the case, too much rain interfering
alike with spring ' wheat planting' and distri
bution of seasonable goods. Â¦'

"The local and coast lumber conditions dur
ing the past month of April have been most
prosperous throughout the length and breadth
of the district. Building demands, especially
in the city of San Francisco and Its outlying
districts, have been heavier than for any 6im
ilar period, as the investments In realty and
the latter' s improvement have been exception
ally large and widespread in Its character. In
fact, there has been no lumber to offset the
increasing demands of this and other cities
of the west, coast. The mills, in many cases,
have been compelled to put on extra shifts.
an3 the saws have no cessation from their
labors. All in all, there has been no rest for
any companies interested in the lumber circles
nf this and the other coast States, and all of
the middlemen have been kept busy looking for
available cargoes and rail shipments.
'â¢Prices have been FtiJC. but no advances have
J.oen scheduled during the last thirty days, and
f-.here seem? to be no opportunity for further
#r.sÂ»s owing to the competitive character of the
lumber trade circles, for should quotations be
piaced any higher there is every probability of
?â¢ncroachment of other woods than the redwood
and pines of our coast.
"Shingles are also Ptiff and the demand Is
daily growing beyond the control of the numer
ous mille of Ihe shingle zone. The Eastern and
Middle Western markets are keen in their call
for the wood products of this coast and shin-
Bles have kept pace with the other mill com
modities. Prices range well Into the profit side
of the ledger, and there is no reason to be
lieve that any depression is liable to occur for
tome time to come, if it appears at all during
the entire year's business activities."

Los Angeles vegetables were offering more

Â¦The market is almost bare of Oregon Onions
and stocks of old consist chiefly of Australians
and Nevadas, which are firmly held at the
quotation. New Red were plentiful and sold
slowly at lower prices. Large quantities of
green, which were carried over from the pre
vious day. sold below the. quoted price. One
car of Nevadas came In. . - "
Oregon. Burbanks are moving out of first
hands as well as can be expected at the high
prices. The top quotation was obtained' for a
few lots of extra choice stock, but 2c was the
top price for the general run of offerings.
There was a noticeable improvement In the
demand for river Burbanks, Â¦ owing to the
scarcity of Oregon. The Oregon Burbanks for
seed continued to meet with a brisk demand,
but other descriptions of seed â¢ Potatoes were
dull. New Potatoes were a shade lower under
heavier receipts. â¢ _/

NEW YORK. May 2.â The stock market re
ceived a shaking out this afternoon, which has
been considered overdue for some time by com
petent observers of conditions. As usual, the
constriction of the money supply is j the im
mediate cause of the fall in prices. Needless
to say, the ground has been prepared by the
manipulation of speculative pools and cliques,
with a resulting inflation in prices which gave
purely fictitious values in the. most flagrant,
cases and a highly speculative range of values
in the whole list. - 'i he lesson of the Interna
tional Power episode was reinforced to-day by
the example of another group which has been
lifted recently by highly manipulated- tactics.
The abrupt break to par of Rutland preferred,
compared with 120 yesterday, was a sufficient
indication on the Stock Exchange of the state
of distrust which has arisen. The displaying
of credits which resulted from the disorgani
zation against collateral loans caused a lively
disturbance in the money market, which was in
a tight condition. Some of the largest banks
loaned very freely at an arbitrary rate of 0
.per cent, but this did not prevent an active
demand at a higher range of rates all the way
up to 10 per cent. The forecast for a weak
bank statement did not give promise of any
immediate relief from the strained condition of
the money market. Indications point to a loss
by the banks of nearly $3,000,000 in spite of
receipts on balance from the Interior and ow
ing to the Sub-Treasury requirements of $4,
134,000. The steadiness in the foreign exchange
market at near the gold export point was also
regarded ominously, as threatening a possible
further complication next ' week. The calling
for payment of a 25 per cent installment of
subscriptions to the steamship merger syndi
cate will require next week an amount ap
proximately $7,500,000. on the supposition that
CO per cent of the subscriptions are payable in
New York and 40 per cent abroad. ' There are
other heavy requirements imminent, including
the disbursement of the dividend to the United
State Steel underwriting syndicate. That some
heavy transactions were carried through yes
terday was indicated by. the large clearings of
the banks, which reached about $447,000,000
for the day. The weakness of the market . was
contested for a time, ; apparently by the ele
ment which has led the speculation for some
time. They had to contend with large Western
orders to sell. The notable strength of Louis
ville and Nashville, which touched 139%, was
attributed to the maneuvers of this element
and said to be facilitated by the existence of
a short interest. Strength In Pennsylvania
was also a help. In the late dealings all at
tempt to support the market was abandoned
and stocks were unloaded indiscriminate;}',
causing a break In prices which reached as
much as 3 per cent and under in the majority
of affected stocks. St. Paul suffered to the
extent of 4%, Canadian Paciflc 3% and other
less prominent stocks from 3 to 7. International
Power continued its eccentric gyrations, which
extended from 102 to 85. with a net loss of
13 points. Hasty profit-taking by the shorts
caused some spasmodic rallies, but the closing
was weak and semi-demoralized.
The bond market shared the weakness of the
stock market, but In much less degree. Total
sales, $3,220,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

FRIDAY,. MAY 2.
NEW YORK, May 2.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission met here to-day
to investigate charges that the immigra
tion bureau maintained in New, York City
by trunk line railroads is operated in vio
lation of United States laws. Judson C.
Clements, A. R. Prouty and J. D. You
mans were, the 'Commissioners present.
Clements acted as chairman.
Edward E. McLeod, - chairman of the
Western Traffic Association, was asked
to. give a copy of the agreement consti
tuting that association, with the names
of .the officers who signed it. He'said'he
would procure a copy and send It to the
commission In Washington. McLeod ex
plained that the establishment of the
bureau in this city has benefited the im
migrants as well as the railroads. He
said that previous to the organization , of
the bureau the middleman made lat'ge
profits at the expense of the Immigrants.
"Under present arrangements," he went
on, "the steamship companies made con
tracts with the immigrant' at the port of
sailing. If an immigrant desires to go
from Denmark," Bay, to North Dakota he
buys his through ticket in Denmark. He
is landed at Ellis Island, passed by the
United States authorities, where his rail
road ticket is supplied him at. the ticket
office maintained at the Â¦ Island under
lease from the Federal authorities. He Is
brdught, immediately he Is released, to
the barge office and forwarded to his des
tination. No hardship, is worked to the
immigrant. He may, if he choose, se
lect his own line of travel, but . few of
the â¢ immigrants â¢ know anything of the
geography of the country, and our bureau
tries to divide the business among the
roads west of Chicago. Rates are cheaper
since the establishment of the burdau In
1894 than before. In 1893 the fare to San
Francisco from New York was J64 25. To
day it is $47 45."
"The association" was formed to main
tain rates, was v, it not?" â¢ McLeod was
asked. -Â¦ ' â.--.;Â¦ - '. -. . â¢ .- .
"One'of its purposes, yes." : â¢ . C
"AncVyou' maintain rates by^'destroying
competition?" ~\ - Â¦.--. Â¦' Â¦â¢ '...'".'Â¦ -'.Z .V-~..-.
"Well,' I would not say that." Before-the
organization of the bureau there was de
moralization and cutting of, rates." '-
"If the immigration bureau was dis
solved ]it .wduld ' result in a cutting of
rates among the Western roads?"
, "I think It would result in demoraliza
tion.? Â« Â¦ r ; ,-

Big Transfer of Property.
A deed covering the transfer by the
Sutro estate to the. San Francisco Con
struction Company "of the Byfield tract
located south of the park and west of
First avenue was filed in the Recorder's
office. The Jract Includes nineteen pieces
of property. The consideration mentioned
is $361,000. A mortgage for $250,000 on the
property is given by Albert J. Raisch,
president of the company, to Henry T
Scott and Charles E. Green as guardians
cf the estate of thÂ© Crocker heirs.
In connection with the announcement of
the opening the board of governors issued
a statement of the benefits ' of the mu
seum. Â¦ Special reports are .given of'con
ditions surrounding the introduction 1 of
lines of goods In- each - of the countries
bordering on the Pacific Ocean. A list of
foreign -firms up Â¦â¢. to date is available. at
the office of : the museum. Information
concerning exports of each Pacific coun
try and also concerning the customs tar
iffs of foreign countries has been collect
ed, and suggestions are given concerning
the necessary methods of packing goods
to go to foreign lands, etc. Â¦
The spectator who sees the exhibits
without being aware of their purpose
would be. liable to be surprised, for in
manufactures only cheap goods are to be
viewed, and the remainder of the exhibi
tion is composed principally of raw ma
terials, .such as aje exported from the
Latin American countries. But these ex
hibits furnish the information that is
needed by those who wish to deal with
the people of these lands or to gain ma-"
tprial information in a trade way about
them. .
The beginning of the installation of ex
hibits was mentioned some time, ago in
The Call. Since then many, cases have
been filled with samples illustrating the
manufactured articles -that are. sold -in
Pacific Coast countries, the array being
an exposition for the benefit of the com
mercial community* of . the; goods for
which ready market . has been found
among the Latin Americans. The exhib
its from countries other than South; and
Central America are yet to. arrive, and
ample space has been reserved for them.
Only a comparatively small share of the
space allotted by the State Harbor Com
missioners to the museum has 'been occu
pied. Exhibits are. to be'-received-from
the Philippines and from Oriental coun
triesâin fact, from all Pacific territory in
which the Pacific Coast may hope to find
a market for- its wares and manufac
tures. A, special'' commissioner, has col
lected .goods in the Philippines for the
museum. â¢ :''â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ . ;Â¦â¢ . ".'

Wherea3 The primary election to be held on
August 12 1002 will determine, through the
delegates thereat elected, who shall be the
Governor of the State of California for four
years and who shall constitute the next Legis

zens in such primary elections, which are now

vote, it is advisable to register at once.
, Registration now will be good without rereg
istration for two years (except In case â¢ of
change of residence) and will entitle the elec

mediate registration, and to point out the ne
cessity and Importance thereof and the danger
that corrupt control of government ' and courts

PRIMARY LEAGUE
DIRECTORS MEET
i The employers .claim that the agree
ment under which the drivers were to be
given increased pay after January l of
this year existed prior to the strike of
last August, and that by that strike the
drivers broke the agreement and were
not entitled to claim the advance in
wages at the beginning of the year.
Nearly all the contractors admit that we are
not asking anything unreasonable. A rate of
$2 25 a day" for the driver of a single team and
$2 50 for the driver of a double team for eleven
hours' work Is little enough. In fact we are
asking only what the contractors promised to
give tip. but of course they, will not get to the
point of giving it until we insist.
The drivers' union will hold a meeting
to-night at Teutonia Hall.
The effort to secure better pay and a
shorter work day for the teamsters en
gaged in hauling materials used in the
building trades is being conducted by
the Building Trades Council, with
Building Materials Team Drivers' Union,
No. 1, is affiliated. It was the central
body that made the demands upon the
employers, and it is that body which will
wage the contest if the contractors re
fuse to comply with those demands.
The Team Drivers* Union numbers about
500 men, and it Is claimed that nearly all
the non-union drivers will quit work
with the union men if the increased pay
Is not granted. While the places of the
drivers might be filled, partly at least,
the other building trades unions would
refuse to handle materials hauled by the
substitute teamsters, and the sympa
thetic- strike resulting would, it is
claimed by the labor leaders, stop the
building industry until the controversy
should be settled. The unprecedented ac
tivity at present among the builders
makes it highly improbable, the union
leaders assert, that the contractors will
hold out against the drivers' demands.
Richard Thane, president of the union,
said yesterday:
The drivers are sanguine that the con
tractors will grant their demands and
that there will be no occasion for them
to strike Monday. Some of the larger
employers are already paying the rates
asked and others have expressed a will
ingness to do so whenever the rate be
comes the accepted one.
Members of -the Contracting Team
sters' Association and representatives of
the executive committee of the Building
Trades Council will probably meet this
afternoon at the office of C. A. Warren
to attempt to reach an understanding
concerning the demands of the Team
Drivers' Union for increased pay and a
shorter work day. Both sides hope that
an amicable adjustment will be made
and the threatened strike averted.
Cox is a mining expert and went to Mex
ico with Will S. Tevis In that capacity.
Previously he owned machine shoos in
this city and sold out. It is said, for $28 -
000. The woman, in speaking of him, said:
"He is an easy mark and you can easilv
separate him from, his pile." They all
left the courtroom together.
When the woman was questioned by the
Judge yesterday she said she did not be
lieve Cox cut her throat. She had at
tempted to put him out of her room and
at the time he had a knife in his hand
paring his nails and she supposed the
knife had been jerked up accidentally and
cut her. She admitted they had been
drinking extensively. She said she would
not 6 wear out a warrant for Cox's arrest.
Duarte also declined to prosecute Cox,
saying Cox was repentant. The Judge
â¢wanted to hear Cox's version of the affair,
but Walter Gallagher, his attorney, would
not allow him to make a statement. The
Judge thereupon, with- the consent of
Assistant District Attorney Ashe, dis
missed the case.
Policeman Pearl went to the scene and
found several men and women in the
room. He searched for a knife and dis
covered a pocketknife with the blade open
and blood on the blade lying under a pair
Â©f gloves on the mantel shelf. He ar
rested Cox on a charge of assault to mur
der and sent the woman and Duarte to
the Emergency Hospital, where their
wounds, which were only superficial, were
stitched and dressed. .
Since her husband's tragic death she has
been a denizen of the "tenderloin" and at
present occupies a room at the PaJmerlee
on Ellis street. Thursday night Cox, who
had known her for about three months,
called at her room. They drank consider
able liquor and early yesterday morning
Cox and the woman quarreled and she
ordered him, she says, out of her room.
Her friend, Joe Duarte, who says he is a
barber in the shop in the Hotel Langham,
and Cox mixed up things and the woman
received a cut on the throat and Duarte
a out on the abdomen.
Belle Chappelle, otherwise known as
Mrs. Paul Antolne, was the central figure
In a case before Judge Cabaniss yester
day in which C. B. Cox, a mining expert.
was charged with an assault to murder
her. More than a year ago her husband,
Paul Antolne, the French Vice Consul, be
ing driven to desperation by his mes
alliance, committed suicide in her pres
ence by blowing out his brains. He had
the night before attempted to butt out his
brains in her room at 35S Geary street.

Something for Mothers to Think" About
EVERY CHILD born' into the world with an inherited
or early developed tendency to distressing, disfiguring;
humours of the skin, scalp, and blood, becomes an object
of the most tender solicitude, not only because of its suf-
fering but because of the dreadful fear that the disfigura-
tion is to be lifelong and mar its future happiness and
prosperity. Hence it becomes the duty of mothers of
such afflicted children to acquaint themselves with the
best, the purest, and most effective treatment available,
viz,, THE CUTICURA TREATMENT.
Warm baths with Cuticuea. Soap, to cleanse the skin of crusts and scales
and soften the thickened cuticle, gentle anpintiugs with Cuticura Oint-
meitt, to instantly allay itching, irritation, and inflammation, and soothe and
heal, to be followed in the severer cases by mild doses of Cuticura Resolt
vent Pills (see below), to cool and cleanse the blood, are all that can be
desired for the alleviation of the suffering of ekin-tortured infants and
children and the comfort of worn-out, worried mothers. A single set cost-
Ing $1.00 is often sufficient to cure when the best physicians fail.
Millions of Women Use Cuticura Soap
AMlBted by Ccticcea. OixTMEJfT, for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the Â¦kin, for
cleantlnr the scalp of cruste, scales, and dandruff, and tne stopping ot failing nair, for
softenlnc, whitenlnir, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes, Itcnings,
and chafings. In the form of baths for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free
or offensive perspiration. In the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many
sanative, antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves to women, especially
mothers, aad for all the purposes of the toilet, bath", and nursery. j
CcncCRA Rbsolye<t Pills (Chocolate Coated) are prepared to meet the wants of
Â¦women and children, and are pure, sweet, tasteless, and odorless. They are beyond ques-
tion the most successful skin and blood purifiers and humour cures yet compounded, and
especially appeal to all having tne care of children.
