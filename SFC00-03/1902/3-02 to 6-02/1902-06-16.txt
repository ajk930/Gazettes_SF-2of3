sidered, would depreciate. Governor Taft
explained that the bonds would be in-,
dorsed by the American Government, and
that Washington would bo ready to pay
cash. It will be impossible to establish
a price for all the land, but, roughly av
eraged, it will be from $7,000,000 to $10 -

Middleton is nineteen years of age, a
carpenter by trade. He will not -talk to
night of the affair, and Miss Cla-wson has
not sufficiently recovered her composure
to furnish an explanation.
For many years he was a prominent
merchant, but lately had been engaged
in contract work. His wife Is well known
in Baptist Church circles'.
The crowd about the jail was large
enough and rapid enough In hasty judg
ment to have accomplished a lynching,
but when the first intense feellne sub
sided there was no danger of law-break
ing. ....
Yeakey was about forty years old and
leaves a wife and two children.
Information . of . tho tragedy spread
quickly and the streets Â¦ were soon
thronged with persons excited over the
sudden and startling nature of tho affair.
On his way to the main part of town
Middleton met Deputy Sheriff F. A. J.
Eckles, to whom he explained that he had
killed Yeakey. and desired to go to the
jail. He was soon afterward placed In a
cell. He maintained a resolute silence as
to the cause of the shooting.
CROWD AT' JAIL.
The shooting was the culmination of a
quarrel between the two men at the home
of Miss Passie Clawson .In West Red
ding. The woman, who is about 25 years
old and has lived here for several years,
was well acquainted with Yeakey and
Middleton. Both had bestowed on her
some attention, and it is conjectured, in
the lack of a definite statement by Miss
Clawson or Middleton as> to the cause,
that a quarrel over this attention
brought about the tragedy. j
BULLET ENDS QUARREL.
Yeakey went to Miss Clawson's ' house
about 10 o'clock to-night and was cordial
ly received by her. '. On entering the par
lor he discovered -that young Middleton
had preceded him in visiting, and he lost ;
no time in exhibiting his displeasure. He
spoke Eevereiy to Middleton, and the
young carpenter resented some of the re
marks made.
. The woman sought to restrain the in- j
creasing belligerence of the two men, but j
was unable' to check the violence of their
tempers or the harshness of their words.
She left the room for 1 a few minutes and
-returned just in time to see Middleton
draw a revolver and fire a bullet at
Yeakey's breast. .

immediately left , the house. Miss Claw

"W., "WASHINGTON, June la.nrSenator
Platt of New York has come forward as
a leader of the Republican side for the
Nicaragua canal bill. Thus he und Sen
ator Hanna are onco more pitted against
each other, this time in one of the great
est contests that has taken place /In the
Senate in recent years. â¢
Platt's activity in a dozen different
ways haa confused the supporters of the
Panama project, and ho is conndent He
will win the fight. . â , .,
The vote comes on Thursday. All Indi
cations now are that it will be close, it
Is impossible to make a poll of the Sen
ate that will actually show the result of
the first test vote, which will come up
on the adoption of the Spooner amend
ment to the Hepburn bill. The Hepburn
bill provides for the construction of the
Nicaragua canal. The Spooner amend
ment is to the effect that the Panama
canal shall be built, if it should become
apparent to the President that all of the
rights and: franchises of the Panama
Company can be purchased for $40,000,000.
I* not, the President shall authorize the
construction of the Nicaragua canal.
The difficulty in arriving at the exact
sentiment in the Senate., lies in the fact
that there are at least seven Senators
who will not indicate their preference one
way or the other, and, who have told Sen
ator Platfe and Senator Hanna that they
have not made up their minds how they
will vote. These Senators hold the val
ance of power. The bill that receives the
support of four of the seven doubtful
Senators will have a majority and will
prevail. -"Â£; %

of San Francisco and Charles de Leigh
of Stockton, at present grand trustee,
Â¦will be candidates for the office of grand

of being grand inside guardian. F. J.
Hern, the incumbent grand treasurer, will
be re-elected to that office, but it is said
that he would like to be chosen repre
sentative' to the Supreme Grove and may
be placed in opposition to J. S. Godeau,
the retiring head of the order.
Following! is a list of the present grand
officers and delegates.
p">npaHE next session of the . Grand Â¦
I Grove of the United Ancient Order
I of Druids will be held in the city
JX of Napa commencing to-morrow
and continuing during . the week.
Delegates from 97 groves, in addition to
the grand officers, will be present.
At the beginning of the present term,.-.,
Julius S. Godeau, the noble grand arch,
made an appeal to the members of . the
subordinate groves to help him secure
two thousand hew members for the order
during his term. The records show that
the 'members did help him, for in that
time there were 2173 initiations, the great
est number in one year in the history of
the order. The grove making the greatest
gain on the basis of percentage was No
vato, of the town of that name, the per
ctntage being three hundred. The re- .
ports to be presented will show that the
membership is now within a few of 6000,
and that, despite losses by suspension
for non-payment of dues and other
causes, the net gain' was nearly 1700.
Eleven new groves were instituted during
the term. 'Â¦
The report of Grand Secretary .Martin- >:,
oni will show that the order during the.
year paid in sick benefits . nearly $33,000, .:
and about $5000 for funeral expenses. The.
number of deaths was 62.
"Not even the King "of England could
have his ipu (cup)," said Fo-Fo, "for
Tuimanua is higher than all other Kings
and the people of Manua are the supreme
people of the earth."
But those accused were acquitted. The
acquittal proved generally unsatisfactory.
Captain Sebree reports that he discovered
that two chiefs at Tutuila, who asked
permission to visit Manua, wanted to do
so for the purpose of seeking trouble with
Tuimanua,
When Tuimanua learned that the cup
had been called for Mauga, he at once or
dered the arrest of those who had called
Itâ Saleapaga and Palaita. The trial was
long and excited the greatest interest.
Fo-Fo. the village magistrate, was a wit
ness. He said that Lei (an official of
Mauga) had done wrong, that the penalty
for breaking the custom of calling the cup
was punishable by death and the destruc
tion of the houses and lands of the ac
cused or by exile.
ACCUSED ARE ACQUITTED.
The young men bound to their feet and
rush to Tuimanua's sleeping place. They
run as. the crow flies and destroy every
thing that comes in their way. The cup
brought back, the maid of the vil
lage, a sort of vestal virgin, ties it, to
a cocoanut palm and offers it to the
King. The King, after an elaborate cere
mony, drinks and thenâ and only then
may tha others drink. The:honor of hav
ing the cup called is seldom granted to
others than a great chief.
The calling of the cup is an interesting
ceremony. When a council is called the
chiefs of the villages gather, each carry
ing a taro root. They sit in a, circle. The
approach of a great chief is heralded by
the sounding of a conch, and he comes
attended by maidens and trumpeters. The
chief seats himself and the maidens gath
er taro roots. Once the kava is prepared
by maidens chewing the roots, the kava
makers take positions beside the kava
bowls and the crier calls for the cup of
the great chief or king.
Saleapaga, one of the village officials,
spoke, saying that Mauga should be al
lowed to have his cup because lie was a
governor, and Palaita, who had .previous
ly offered Mauga his cup, called out,
"Aumai le ipu o le Kovana" (Fetch the
cup of the governor). This was a calling
of the cup, and kava was straightway
served and drunk.

W. t WASHINGTON. June 15.â Trouble is
brewirig in Samoa. Even now the chiefs
may have led their -warriors with black
ened faces to war on account of a dispute
over etiquette surrouacing the method of
serving kava, the national drink, bnnilar
disputes in years past have led to atroci
ties, and many German soldiers were vic
tims in the 'SO's. v
Tuimanua, who styles himself King of
Manua, has a great following on the isl
ands, and the etiquette in fores at his
court provides that he is the only person
whose cup may be "called" when he is
served with kava. Mauga,, chief and dis
trict governor, dared to command his cup
"called" when kava was served him. Tho
matter was carried into the courts, but
the decision rendered by the district court
was far from satisfactory to the chiefs,
nnd it has been reported to the Xavy De
partment that they are anxious to have
it out with each other on the field of bat
tle.
Captain Uriel Sebree, commandant of
the Tutuila naval 6tation, has submitted
a report on the trouble to the Navy De
partment. Mauga one day visited the vii
lag-e of Ofu, in Manua. A council was
held and kava was served. Mauga re

their countrymen that the five soldiers
of the Fifth Cavalry who were captured
by the insurgents on May 30 have been
boloed to death near Teresa, in Morong
province, Luzon. This report has not
been, confirmed by the American author
ities 'of that district.
Â¦ .Â¦ Twenty-five members of a band .of in
surgents who were captured while fight
ing with General Lukban in Samar took
the oath of allegiance to the United
States and were subsequently released.
Four members of the band were killed
in the engagement' which resulted in the
capture of their companions. The twen
ty-five who have sworn allegiance have
fseen General Chaffee, and have promised
to give him all the assistance in their
power in the work of maintaining the
present peace conditions in Samar.
A commission has been sent to Samar
to appoint Senor Llorentes Governor of
the island and to establish civil govern
ment there. It is expected that a gener
al amnesty will be declared on July 1.
The amnesty will result in the release
of the Filipino prisoners now on the isl
and of Guam. .'r'L'K
The prospects in the island of Leyte
for a speedy termination of the armed
resistance are bright. Since the ports
of the island were closed surrenders of
insurgents to the native constabulary
have occurred daily.
OBJECTS TO JUDCrE RHODE.
When the criminal suit brought by.Be
into Legarda, a Filipino member of the
civil commission, against the newspaper
Freedom for having published a libelous
article frcm another newspaper of Ma
nila came up for hearing last week "coun
sel for the editor of Freedom objected to
Judge Rhode, before whom the suit was
to be tried, on the ground that when
Rhode was a private attorney he had ad
dressed opprobrious epithets to the editor
of the paper, and declared that he would
not rest until he had landed him in pris
on. Judge Rhode admitted having made
tthis statement, but said he thought he
â¢was capable of trying the case fairly.
Henry Ide. the member of the Philip
pine Commission who was assigned to tRe
department of finance and justice, has re
ceived a petition from the printers in the
employ of the Government asking that
their salaries be paid in gold or in some
other established and non-fluctuating cur
rencv. in reply to this petition Ide said
he thousrht that the conditions of which
the printers complained probably would
be relieved- They are now paid in Mexi
can silver.
ANSWERS INSULT TO ARMY.
Speaking at the West Point centennial
dinner, which was held here last week.
acting Civil Governoi* Wright said he did
not think "the strife now being waged in
Congress on the Philippine government
bill is as fierce and as irreconcilable as
It appears to be." He said that the sober
second thought of the American- people
was always right and that they would in
time do justice to the Americans in the
Philippine Islands.
Speaking at the same dinner Colonel
Charles A. Woodruff, head of the subsist
ence department at Manila, eaid:
"The graduates of West Point may be
â¢ 'charity boys,' but in the Mexican war
these boys saved the nation in money
alone more than the military school has
cost since its foundation. The same boys
led 2,000,000 men to victory in the greatest
of modern wars. The 'charity boys" have
all repaid their board and keep a thou
sandfold; they can glory in, the fact that
â¢wherever 25,000 American troops have
faced an enemy the commander of these
men was a West Point graduate. The es
tablished reputation ot the boys irom
West N Point has become a synonym for
honor, integrity and the highest credit in
the country."
The Chamber of Commerce has present
ed to General Chaffeo a set of resolutions
expressing the regard with which General
Cbaffee and the army in the Philippines
ere held by the business men of Manila.
DATTOS ASK TOR FLAGS.
General Davis, commander of the Amer
ican, forces on the island of Mindanao,
has been informed by Datto Ada that two
of the three Moros who murdered the
American soldier named Lewis were killed
In the engagement at Bazan between
Moros and Americans last May and thjft
the other murderer has disappeared.
An American Bentry of the engineers
. was badly cut with a bolo in the hands
of a Moro while on duty near Vicars.
Several dattos under the Sultan of i Min
danao have called upon Colonel Frank D.
Baldwin of the Twenty-seventh Infantry
and have asked him for American flags.
"Ihis action on the part of the dattos is
considered equivalent to taking the oath
cf allegiance to the United States.

disappointment, however, and started to
recross the river, to the Sacramento shore.-
The gasoline supply gradually dimin
ished until, in midstream, the engine
stopped . altogether, and the boat began
to arift In the direction of a barge moored
near the Sacramento short. Dewitt called
to a' passing boatman to throw him a line
and tow ' him : into, shore, but -before this
cculd be done the boat was drawn close
up to the, barge. â¢ Dewitt and Turner arose
in the launch and attempted to push
away, but the current was - strong, and

DUNSMUIR. June 15.â From 10 o'clock
last night until 6 o'clock this evening the
Oregon and California Railroad track,
three-quarters of a mile above Shasta
Springs, remained completely, blocked,
v.hile the Dunsmuir wrecking crew strug
gled at the most obstinate barrier of
wreckage which It had to remove la a long
:iise. In a narrow cut, where both banks
rise to a great height, seven or eight
loaded freight cars were jammed and
wrecked and piled In a solid wall.
The accident occurred to south-bound
freight No. 25 at 10 o'clock last night.
The long train had just come down the
steep grade from Mott. had crossed the
rjver and ran at good speed into the nar
row cut at a curve. In the middle of the
train was a large, heavily loaded freight
car. As this reached the cut' It went over
upon its side and at least seven cars
which followed were wrecked on top of
and against it. The train came to a stand
still. Oddly enough, no tramps were un
der the cars and no one was hurt.. Rail
road men say it was the worst wreck bar
ricade ever seen urion the division. The
wreckers could not lift the debris to one
side, but had to follow the slow method
of taking it, piece at a time, out cf the
cut. The south-bound passenger this
morning was held at Mott and a special
went down from Dunsmuir. The north
bound lay at Dunsmuir ten hours before
It could get through.

Disaster Occurs to a Heavy Train in

IN MASS OF WEECKAGE
Coroner Crowe went to the scene of the
tragedy this afternoon and brought the
body to the morgue. Sheriff Mansfield is
working on. the ' case with the hope of
bringing the murderer to justice.
Briggan had been occupying what Is
known as the Rice ranch, and had Matli
in his employ for the last four months.
Some time yesterday groans.*were heard
by a passer-by, and they sounded as
though some person was in distress. The
Sheriff's o&ce was notified, and an in
vestigation was made. The Briggan
house was examined, and blood stains
were found leading Ircm one room into
another and then to a window. An ef
fort had been cade to wash out the
stains, but without success.
From the window the .officers followed
a trail, maae apparently by the drag-
Sing of some heavy body. This trail led
vhrough the brush to a picket fence,
where a picket had been taken off, and
<iown the mountainside for 250 feet
to the creek bed. Here there was a large
hole about fifteen feet deep, and in the
bottom of it, covered with two feet of
earth, was found the body of Matli.
The bodv had been almost cut to pieces
with a hatchet and the head smashed in
with the blunt edge of the weapon. The
victim had only his night clothes on.
What led to the murder, for murder it
certainly was, has not been learned, as
Bripgan* professes to know nothing about
it. He says he paid the man off yesterday
and he went away. So far as known both
men were quiet and peaceable citizens.
The deceased was well known at a Swiss
saloon in San Francisco irr the neighbor

the union. The four men have quit work.
President Gftday's mission here was to
get" President Mitchell's permission to con
tinue the strike against the Sonman Shaft
Coal Company, -near Portage, Pa., and
also the financial support of the national
organization. He received both. The
strike at that place was begun on April
16 because the company would not recog
nize the union and sign the wage scale.
About 150 men are involved.
SMALL STRIKE SETTLED.
. By the slovz destruction of mine property. By
that I mean that: if they do not give the men
the hours and. pay they ask for the men will
not consent to go -into the mines and preserve
the operations. The collieries will fill if the
strike is not soon ended, and the mines will be-'
gin to squeeze or, cave in. All the timbermen
are out, and the timber which . holds up the
roofs of' the mines will soon begin to give way.
These squeezes will cost thousands of dollars to
repair and will j probably be the cause of the
abandonment of many ccstly operations. When
the investors' pockets begin to feel It a change
In the attitude of operators will come and the
miners can wait for the change.
Asked as to how the miners expected to
win,. in view of' the' fact that they have
practically reached the limit of their re
sources .in this* region in pressing the
operators and 'the- latter still stand out
firmly, he replied:
*/ Our men will do whatever President Mitchell
says ' They can have our financial support, and
if Mitchell sees fit to ask our men to lay down
their picks they will do It promptly. I do not
believe, however, there will be a general strike
of the soft coal miners because the anthracite
men are going to .win wlthout.it.
| President Gilday said â¢ he had no per
sonal knowledge that the other bituminous
presidents were doing the same * as him
self, but he felt sure they were. Some
soft coal is coming into the anthracite
market from Gentral r Pennsylvania;, West
Virginia, and Virginia, but it is. mostly of
non-union production. ' |

territory as to j a. general strike to help
the" hard^-eoal miners- Giiday said:

WILKESBARRE, Pa., June 15.â Patrick
Gilday, president of the Central Bitumin
ous District of the'Unitedv Mine Workers
of America, who came here: to consult
President : Mitchell on a . matter local to
his district, gave an insight t6-day as to
what the soft coal miners in his territory
are doing .to help their; brother workmen
in the anthracite field. Gilday said there
are 42,000 soft coal miners in his district
and everyone of them is taking a deep
interest in the struggle now going : 6n in
this region. On the second day of the
strike Gilday sent out- instructions to
every check weighman and to every pit
committeeman in his district - to prevent
the shipment of coal to anthracite terri
tory,. and thus far, he said, very, little
coal from his district has taken the place
of anthracite. He said:
There have been only four attempts by union
ized; mines to send -soft- coal to the anthracite
markets. One order was Intended for Mount
Carmel, Pa.; two, for Philadelphia and one for
New York. As soon as our men at the mines
learned the. Intended destination of the coal we
requested the mine-owners not to Â¦ send ,it, and
they, complied with the request. - "We are not

coal. -.,.'Â¦

This issue of $9,000,000, series A, first mortgage, 5 per cent sinking fund, gold bonds, due
1932, is part of an authorized issue of $16,000,000, bonds of $1000 each, $5,500,000 having been
withdrawn from the public issue under the vendors' and subscribers' contracts and for providing
cash working capital for the company, and $1,500,000 being reserved in the treasury of the com-
pany. Additional bonds may be issued only for the purpose o^ acquiring additional plants and
equipment and for improvement and betterments, upon such terms and conditions as shall be ap-
J roved by the holders of a majority of the bonds outstanding at the time of such approval.
Messrs. Alexander & Green, counsel for the company, certify as to the validity of the organi-
zation and of the securities issued, and the title of the company to the property acquired. .
Current books of account and contracts for work now in the hands of the corporations
above specified have been examined by W. T. Simpson; F. I. A., New York, and Riddell & Com-
The distinct advantages of one corporation in the operation of a number of shipyards were
stated in the report made on that subject en December 22, 1900, by Naval Constructor F. T.
Bowles (now Rear Admiral and Chief Constructor of the United States Navy), as follows:
First â Each concern builds that for which it is best fitted and equipped, or that which its
character, location and labor can accomplish most economically.
Secondâ Structural . materials, steel, iron, timber, etc., can be purchased at the lowest rates,
and a prompt supply secured 'at points where it is most needed.
7 Thirdâ The technical knowledge of design, which comes from experience, records and data
of eachi concern will be combined, thus giving confidence to customers that the results contracted-
' for shall be attained.
Fourthâ The Healthy professional rivalry of the various yards can be utilized to produce the
best results in design, construction and administration, without the disastrous And narrowing de-
vices of destructive competition.
Fifthâ The standardization of the numberless details of ship fittings, auxiliaries and appli-
ances, which are now almost as various and incongruous in design as they are in number, and
their production in quantity by those best qualified, would produce enormous economies. .
, Sixthâ It will be possible to effect great economies by the separation of worships and mer-.
chant construction' into , different establishments, thus avoiding the difficulties of organization and
increased cost of radically different types of construction upon adjoining ships. v
Seventhâ The better organization and management of the individual concerns would be t
necessary and direct result of this incorporation.
Â£ These "bonds .are; secured by a first mortgage on the above mentioned plants, appraised as
going concerns, at more than $20,000,000, in addition to which these companies will have a work-
ing capital of more than $5,000,000, and the constitutent companies' have now on hand contracts
Vfor' work amounting to more than $36,000,000, on which the profits are estimated at over $5,-
000,000, or more than sufficient to pay interest on bonds and sinking fund for five years.

Clearly there "are seme stalwarts left in the land.
Bryan need not fret about the reorganizers. There
is still a party to give him a .nomination ... for the
Presidency, in 1904, and, as he would never have a
chance of election- anyhow,; it cannot matter much to
him from what kind of a forlorn- hope party the
nomination come&; :; ;
After such a start the enthusiastic Bryanites
adopted a platform which . ratifies, arid affirms the
platform of the national convention in Kansas City,
demands the withdrawal of American troops from the
Philippines and the establishment of the indepen
dence^ the islands under an American protectorate,
advocates the single tax, initiative and referendum,
direct nomination of candidates, election of United
States Senators and Federal Judges by direct vote of
the people, legislation in favor of an eight-hour day
and the governmental ownership of railroads, tele
graphs and 'telephones. One plank in the platform
denounces the whole existing industrial system on the
ground that under it "the few get without working
and the many work without getting." Â¦
Â¦ An interesting feature' of the Â¦convention was the
oratory, which was tr ( uly Bryanesque. "One speaker
said "the feorganizers are trying to' get harmony in
the party, but it is ragtime harmony.". He, predicted
that .before they get through the party' will be even
more syncopated than it is v now. Another said "it
would be better to have Bryan and . a currency of
paving-stones than such an office-holding crew as we
have now." A . third said, "I would rather vote â¢ for
Bryan, on ther'rottenest platform ever penned by
man than for David Bennett Hill on the Ten Com
mandments." . Â¦ V '\ :
: The convention was attended by but 210 delegates,
but what it lacked in numbers it made up in vim and
vigor. It began by cheering for Bryan and hissing
at the name of David Bennett Hill. We are told, that
cne of the notable incidents of the convention was
the mention of the name of John P. Altgeld by the
Rev. Dr. Livingston in the prayer with which' he
opened the convention. As he mentioned the name
of the ex-Governor the delegates all cheered and
shouted, and the minister had to suspend his prayer
until the commotion subsided. Then he went on and
finished it. ' ' . . ' *. Â¦ -'
WHILE the Democrats of the West and the
South who so loudly and strongly shouted
for Bryan in 1896 and 1900 are now holding
conventions without giving him even so much as a
mention, over in New York there has arisen a Dem
ocracy that continues the shout; In the land which
Bryan once described as "the enemies' country" are
now to be found about the only- friends he has. Re
cently they held a convention, nominated a full, State
ticket, took to themselves the title "Liberal Democ
racy," and are now in the field to meet the reorgan
izers in a fight to a finish. - /

The farms of the islands are owned or operated by
six classes of farmers': Whites, Hawaiians, Chinese,
Japanese, South . Sea Islanders and negroes. Only
the first three, classes! are either numerous or im
portant.on account of their holdings. ' The total
value of the farm property of the white ' operators
constitutes 92.1 per cent of the total farm property
of the Territory. Â¦ Tjie average area of their farms
is 2328.4 acress in excess'of that of. the farms of the
part Hawaiians, who have the next highest average.
The. Chinese 'Jarmers, 82.3 per cent of whom -are ten
ants, operate fcsi than one : sixteenth as much land "as*
The amount of public lands in the islands is large,
but not all of it is suitable for cultivation. The re
port says of the original "crown lands" there remain
920,583 acres, and of the "government lands" 789,532
acres, making a total of 1,710,115 acres, valued at
$3,480,400, now classed as "public land." According
to the report of the Governor of Hawaii for 1901,
only 1,371,232 acres are now under lease, from which
the Government receives an annual rental of $76,802.
As this area contains many great expanses of moun
tainous and forest lands, unsuitable: for agriculture,
only 62 per cent of it is reported as being included
in the Territory's 2273 farms.
In 1894 the republic of Hawaii took possession of
the crown lands and consolidated them with those
previously known as "government -lands," under the
general designation of "public lands." For the pur
pose of promoting the and cultivation
of these the â¢Government provides public lands may
be acquired by individuals by homestead lease, 1 right
of purchase lease, cash freehold, special agreement
and cash sales. :
The Territory of Hawaii is composed of tvventy
islands, of which only seven are inhabited. On June
1, 1900, when the census was .taken, the farms num
bered 2273 and were valued at $60,029,956. Of this
amount, $3,545,895, or 5.9 per cent, represents the
value of buildings, and $56,484,061, or 94.1 per cent,
the value of land and improvements other than build
ings. On the same date the value of farm imple
ments and machinery was $11,484,890, and or live
stock, $2,570,142. These values, added to that of
farms, give the "total value of farm property," $74,
084,988, an average agricultural investment per in
habitant of $481.07.
CENSUS Bulletin No. 169 gives the statistics
of agriculture in the Hawaiian Islands, and
they are the more interesting because this
is the first time the /census of the islands has been
taken by the United States. It is noted, however,
that as the Census Bureau was unable to obtain re
ports of expenditures for taxes, insurance, feed of
stock and similar expenses, no estimate of the net
income of farms can be given. Furthermore, the
bureau has .been unable to get detailed statements as
to irrigation, but the importance of it as a factor in
the agricultural development of the islan'ds is plainly
set forth in the report. * , .

TWO opposite conditions characterized trade last
week, one favorable and the other adverse. The
former was the fine crop prospect, the latter the
prevailing labor troubles, chiefly the coal strike,
which interfered with several important branches of
business. It reduced the distributive trade over a
wide area, and, by increasing the cost of fuel, de
creased manufacturing all along the Atlantic sea
board. It cut down the production of pigiron and
thereby increased imports of this product from
abroad. In this connection it may be said that our
importations cf iron and steel from Europe have
been steadily increasing for some little time. Though
manufacturers of implements have been free pur
chasers of pigiron for next year's delivery and some
large contracts for structural and bridge material
have been placed of late, there is now a falling off
in the demand for hardware, heretofore one of the
most active articles in the United States, and in tin
plates, sheets and wire. The railway and agricul
tural works, however, are still reported crowded' with
orders, so, in spite of increasing imports of the raw
material from abroad and the halting tendency in
scrne lines, the. iron and steel trade is found to be
still in excellent condition.
The railway earnings continue to make a good
showing, those in May being 8.7 per cent of the same
month last year and 21.7 per cent over 1900. The
country's bank clearings are still falling behind those
of last. year, the decrease last week being 23 per cent,
the heaviest loss being 32 per cent at New York.
The failures during tjie week numbered 165, against
188 during the corresponding week in 1901. The
textiles are quoted steady, chiefly on account of lim
ited stocks of woolen and cotton goods. The in
quiry for raw wool has been very good of late, but
cotton buyers are holding off for the hew crop, and
are more or less indifferent. The hide market is re
ported in better shape than of late, being generally
strong and active, but leather rules rather quiet. The
other staples show no new features worthy of com
ment. ......
Speculation seems to be at a low ebb all over the
country, which in many respects is a good thing.
There is hardly anything doing in grain and pro
visions on the Chicago Board of Trade, while Wall
street has been dull for weeks, witlv no indications
of any revival in the near future.. All .speculative
markets are now sustained -by professionals, as the
public are no longer in the ring.
The above points cover the general condition of.
trade throughout the country. Â¦ On this coast con
ditions remain precisely as for several months. Busi
ness here is neither better nor worse than at any
time since the first of the year. Nor are there any.
conditions to produce much variation. We are doing
a fine business right along, both in the city and
country, with excellent crop prospects, plenty of
money, good collections, a steady and very desirable
immigration from Â£he older States, and thousands of
tourists and homeseekers spending their money from
one end. of the State to the other. We were never
more flourishing, and the State never looked better
nor felt better. Prices for farm products as a rule
bid fair to be rather above the normal this fall, and
as the yield of almost everything will be large we
can hardly miss having a prosperous year. Real
estate continues to sell well, and the planes of price?,
both for city and country property, are distinctly
higher than they were Â«everal years ago, a good

. Somehow or other attention has recently been
directed to California as an excellent field for the
investment of capital, and in consequence property
titles are undergoing a good many changes all over
the State. New financial blood is coming in freely
and the old is expanding just as freely in the familiar
field. This is very good. There is plenty of room in
California for both new and old energy, and if it
is directed with merely ordinary discretion it can

An interesting feature in connection vrfth the ancestry of Davis' flock, is the
fa"ct that the propensity to come. in groups seems to be a. family trait. Davis'
mother was a triplet, his grandmother was a twin, and his great grandmother
boasted the record of giving birth to three pairs' of twins. On the mother's side
of the house the record, while not so striking, is a good one, as Mrs. Davis'
father was the parent of four pairs of twins.
The Davises came to California only about three months ago from Lehl, Ar
izona, where the girls were born on June 18, 1901, making them now almost a
year old. They weighed at birth five, five and one-half and six pounds respec
tively, and at teji months they tipped the scales at twenty, twenty and one-half
and twenty-one pounds, their 'increase in -.weight having been exactly uniform.
Diamond, Ruby and Pearl are the names of these mother's jewels, and con
sidered as a cluster or in solitalr^ they are enough to make glad the hearts of
the most ambitious parents. â¢
SANTA ANA, June 15.â Joseph W. Davis, an Orange County farmer living
near Garden Grove, thinks that Providence has indeed not neglected him.
The cause of Davis' satisfaction is not an abundant crop of beets or a boun
teous yield of alfalfa, but it is that Mrs. Davis, his wife, has given birth
to the prettiest, sweetest, healthiest girl triplets that ever surprised an expectant
father. *

Their admission will bring the whole of the great
West into the Union. , Territorial government here
after will be confined to our far-off possessions in
the islands and in Alaska. The West, like the East,
will enjoy the full measure of statehood. There is
nothing in the question of admitting the new States,
however, \that is at all sectional. There will be an
increased representation of the West in Congress,
but the new members will have no local interest '.to
maintain in opposition to the general good. The
promise' of admission next winter, may therefore be
hailed with gratification throughout the country.
The right of full self government will benefit the new
States, and in their advancement and development
the whole country will be benefited. * â¢
The justice of the claims of Arizona, New Mexico
and Oklahoma to statehood cannot be disputed.
Each of them has ample population and wealth to
support the responsibilities of State government, and,
moreover, each has an abundance of resources that
guarantees future growth and development.
It would have been gratifying to have had the new
States admitted at this session so that their symbolic
stars might have been displayed upon the national
banner on the coming Fourth of July. However, the
time of waiting will not be long. In the history of
a State a year does not count for much, and it seems
reasonable to conclude that when the bill is taken
up next session, it will be promptly passed.
-â¢ While the postponement is"a matWr for regret it
seems to be the. inevitable. result. of the wrangle hi
the Senate over the isthmian canal bill and the Cuban
reciprocity bill., The hot season has already begun
at Washington, a political campaign is approaching
and members of Congress are eager to get away to
their homes or to the summer resorts. It is doubt
less to those causes the postponement is due.
BY a party vote the Senate. Committee on Ter
ritories has decided to postpone reporting the
omnibus statehood bill until the*~next. session.
The decision of the committee is- that at the next
session the bill shall be taken up early so as' to obtain
for it right of way and ; a fair chance of enactment
before the session closes.
THE STATEHOOD BILL.
It turns out that while Bryan has been invited to
attend the Tilden Club banquet at New York to
meet Cleveland and Hill, he has riot been invited to
speak. Under such circumstances ' Mr. Bryan may
be. expected to stay at home and dine where he can
talk if he pleases.
The armor manufacturers are showing Â»
commendable activity and already two
lots of armor Intended for the six arm
01 ed cruisers have been tested and ac
cepted. Hithertoo the .nondelivery of
ships within contract time has beÂ«n chief
ly due to the dilatoriness of the Carnegte
and Bethlehem works to supply the armor,
but the conditions have changed and none
of the ships building are ready for the
armor. Each of the six armored cruisers
require 1908 tons of armor; the five battle
ships require 3332 tons and three smaller
armored cruisers 743 tons. The contracts
for a total of 37,690 tons were awarded
November 28, 1900, at prices reduced from
$545 to $490 per ton for the heavier kind
and at $400 for the lighter armor. Tho
tests Indicate that American armor la
superior to that of foreign make, and tha
price pajd is considerably lower than tha
French and German products, .
Senator Hale has Introduced a bill for
the relief of Omenzo G. Dodge, a profes
sor of mathematics in the Naval Acad
emy. It provides for the transfer of Mr.
Dodge from the corps of professors in the
navy to the corps of civil engineers with
the same rank and pay he now receives to
take rank in the civil engineer corps next
after Civil Engineer U. S. G. White. Tha
object of this "relief bill in placing Mr.
Dodge third on the list of civil engineers,
with the rank of commander, is to maka
him eligible for selection as Chief of the
Bureau of Yards and Docks to succeed
Rear Admiral Endlcott, who retires No
vember 26, 1306. The corps consists- of
twenty civil engineers at the present time,
receiving salaries and longevity pay rang
ing from $3740 to $2700 per annum, and Mr.
Dodge would be entitled to the salary of
$3740 instead of $3500, which he
now receives. Professor O. G.
Dodge entered the Naval Academy June
6, 1S73, graduated June IS. 1379, and became
a lieutenant June 19. 1S92. One week later
he resigned . and was appointed professor
of mathematics at a salary of $3500. ah in
crease of $1300 on his former pay, and get
ting rid of disagreeable sea service. The
pecuniary advantage thus obtained by Mr.
Dodge Is indicated by the fact that "Will-,
lam, P. Full am, who also graduated in
1S79 and has remained in the line corps, la
only a lieutenant commander at a salary
of $2975 on shore duty. The civil engineers
naturally object to this favoritism, which
is calculated to demoralize not alone that
particular corps but all grades In the
navy, and Senator Hale's bill for the re
lief of Professor Dodge is meeting with a
vigorous opposition. - *
The development of the German navy.
since 1S66 has been # steady and gradual.
In 1866 the Prussian fleet consisted of fiva
armored ships and eight frigates and cor
vettes which were turned over to the em
pire. By 1910 the navy will consist ot
thirty-eight battleships, fourteen armored
cruisers and thirty-eight cruisers, involv
ing a total cost of $365,000,000 for ships and
$66,000,000 for dockyards. In 1872 the navy
expenditures were $7,770,530, and in 1900 tho
appropriations reached. $40,553,953. â¢'-
The Vulcan Shipbuilding Company of
Shettln Intends to establish a shipbuild
ing plant on the Elbe between Hamburg
and Cuxhafen for the construction of
large mercantile and naval vessels This
firm, the most important in Germany,
built the Deutschland, Kronprinz Wilhelm
and Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse besides a
majority of the armored ships of the Ger
man navy. Its location at Shettin on the
Baltic Is not so favorable for buildins
large ships as a yard located near Cux
hafen will be, notwithstanding: the tet
ter's proximity to the open sea, as the
German fleet has grown to such an ex
tent as to be able to protect the Elbe from
the attack of foreign fleets.
At the Dusseldorf exhibition, shortly to

Austria-Hungary has a little bit of sea
coast on the Adriatic extending from Tri-'
este in Austria to Fiume in Hungary, a
distance of about eighty miles. On this
limited sea-coast three naval establish
ments are located, namely, at Trieste,
Flume and Pola. The navy as regards ma
terial and personnel is fully up to modem
requirements, the ships being as efficient
as similar .types in other navies and quite
as attractive as the Elswlck built ships
for the South American navies. The Aus
trian navy is. chiefly for coast defense and
consists of fourteen battleships, of which
three are under construction, two armor
ed cruisers, four monitors, sixteen cruis
ers, forty-two torpedo boats and seven
miscellaneous craft. Austrian ships oi
Â¦war are rarely seen outside of European
waters and considering the very short sea
coast it is better protected by floating de
fenses than any other in the world.
The Japan Gazette tells of a very grace
ful act by Rear Admiral Frederick Rod
gers which fcnnot fail to make that offi
cer and the United States navy popular
in Japan. He recently invited and enter
tained on board his flagship New York a.
Japanese fisherman, Hirai Sukekichi, who
served Commodore Perry as boatman in
1854, when the American squadron arrived
at Uraga. Hirai is 90 years of age and
was accompanied by his 60-year-old son,
a grandson of 41 and his great-grandson
of 18 years. After the entertainment Ad
miral Rodgers had the whole party photo
graphed standing about the recently
erected monument to Commodore Perry.
The battleship Mikasa arrived at Yok3
suka May 25 after a voyage of sixty
seven days from England. ' She was built
at' Barrow by Vickers, Sons & Maxim
at a cost complete with armament of $7,
130,000 and was delivered to the Japaneso
Government in the short time of threa
years. Her keel was laid January 15, 1S90,
the launch took place November 8, 1900,
and the trial one year later. She Is the
last of the battleships ordered under the
programme of 1895, which provided for
117 vessels, including thirteen armored
ships.' The Mikasa is an improvement on
the Asaki and Hatsuse. The vessel is of
15,200 tons, 15,000 horsepower and eighteen
knots speed, with a coal capacity of 14C0
tons, sufficient for a steaming distance of
9000 miles at ten knots. She is considered
by high naval experts to embody all the
requirements of the most perfect typeof
a battleship. , ---". ~^fl
A coal contractor has got himself into
trouble with the naval authorities at Yo
kosuka through fraud in delivery of coal.
He was awarded a contract for 1000 tons
of Cardiff coal at $11 55 per ton, notwith
standing the quotations at Yokohama
were S12 to $12 50, to which the cost of
freight to Yokosuka should be added. To
make up for the apparent loss, the con
tractor bought 350 tons of cheap Japanese
coal at $4 25 per ton and concealed it un
der 650 'tons of genuine Cardiff coal. Tho
yard authorities duly inspected and ac
cepted the lot, and now there is likely to
be trouble for the negligent officers.
The sober-minded part of the community looks to
sober discussion, being aware that public service cor
porations can be compelled to right courses by law,
and that the politicians who let them do as they
please will be the same politicians who will control
public utilities under public ownership and adminis
tration.
In the other view of the matter public service cor
porations will see their own responsibility for this is
sue of public ownership. The final result depends
largely upon their own methods and conduct. The
leaders in this socialistic movement propose to take
advantage of everything that will recruit their fol
lowing, and nothing pleases them better than the un
popularity of a public service corporation.
But the object lesson is lost upon the people be
cause of their prejudice against the street railroads..
So in that city the people are suffering from typhoid
fever on account' of the inefficient public administra
tion of the water supply, and are, at the same time,
crying out for taking over the street railroads. If
this were done it is entirely probable that'administra
tion of the street railways would be characterized by
the same waste, corruption and incompetence that
have marred the water administration, but of that the
people do not stop to think. They are prejudiced
against the street railway management and want re
venge. It goes without saying that a public policy
which may work a sinister change in government it
self is of too great importance to be entered upon for
revenge. .
It is above all things advisable that the discussion
be without prejudice. -Mayor Phelan seems to have
left behind him the material for much personal preju
dice, and the advocates of public ownership can
hardly discuss the matter without ventilating him or
the Board of Works, ory some of the newspapers.
Without joining in the attack or defense, we have to
advise the reformers that their opinion of Mr. Phelan
and the Board of Works and the newspapers is not
at all interesting to the people who want to know all
about the theory and 'practice of public ownership.
An issue of such supreme importance should be dis
cussed and determined without prejudice. Yet there
is none now in focus that seems to depend as much
upon prejudice for its motive power, for this the
public service corporations are largely responsible.
Where such corporations give a good service, are on
friendly terms with the public and are content with
a proper profit on a proper capitalization, there will
be found but little sentiment in favor of public.own
ership. The ownership of the water sup'ply of the
city of Chicago furnishes a rather revolting chapter
in the history of municipal ownership. Waste and
corruption in administration have gone hand in hand
with a nasty and unwholesome supply.
NO otlier question seems to be as generally in
issue and as widely discussed as public owner
ship and government administration of what
are called public utilities, such as water and light
supply, common carriers and like forms of busi
ness. So far/ the opponents of public ownership
seem to have a little the. better of the argument on
the case presented by citation of the facts. Wherever
keen and expert investigation have been made it seems
to be demonstrated that the cost to the people under
public ownership and administration is greater than
under corporate ownership. â¢- j
As an organization to promote public ownership
has been formed in this city, we may expect the prop- 7
aganda to proceed on definite lines and that the pub
lic will be fully informed in )all the phases of the
matter.

A curious illustration of the difference in the meth
ods of the farming of the different races in the islands
is shown in. the statement that the Chinese farmers
expend for labor $21.45 per acre, the' whites expend
$3.49 per acre and the Hawaiians $0.11.
As is well known, the sugar industry is the largest
in the islands. The 170 plantations engaged in sugar
growing contain 1,043,117 acres of land, or 40 per cent
of all the farm land. The estimate of the total cost
of raising a ton of cane and converting it into sugar
is $5.46, while the average value of the sugar pro-'
duced from that amount of cane is $8.60, leaving a
margin of $3.14 per .ton to cover interest on invest
ment, maintenance of equipment and buildings, etc.
the . Hawaiians, who rank second in the matter of
total farm area, but the total value of their holdings,
$2,945,905, exceeds that of the Hawaiians by $1,048,

of the actual wealth of the Chinese farmers of Hawaii,
as the value of the 'farm property of the 83 Chinese;
owners is but $212,620. .

Colonel A. C. Girard's recent promotion
to full colonelcy in the army and appoint
ment to the chief offlce of assistant
surgeon general at Washington has one
drawback. We are all glad of his success,
but it means the loss of Mrs. Girar'd
almost before society has come to know
her. Colonel Girard has been stationed
here three years, and during two of thooe
social seasons his wife has been traveling
in the Orient. During the winter
just passed she was a sufferer
in hospitals and . is no sooner well
again than she prepares to speed
to Washington. Mrs. , Girard has
many strong friends In . the city who
pronounce her a charming entertainer
and an exceptionally clever woman with
many accomplishments. ' Nature was
lavish with her gifts, and. the fine- arts
are well represented In Mrs. Girard's pro
clivities. She sketches, paints, sings,
plays and writes well. Her sketch' of
"The Old Veteran" attracted much favor
able comment from artists when it ap
peared two years ago and has been fre
quently reproduced. All this besides.rais
ing a family of four children and keeping
a home. Her son Is well-known as one of
Roosevelt's gallant rough riders. The
three daughters, Mrs. I. C. Jenks, Mrs.
Roes I* Bush and Mrs. Arthur R. Ker
win. are the wives of army officers and
live in this vicinity. ! SALLY SHARP.
ly, when the noted guest signified her In
tention of lighting a cigarette with the
gentlemen. â¢ People immediately divided
themselves into two classesâ those â¢ who
approved of her act and those who did
not. A few of both classes, however,
summoned that species of valor some
times called discretion and .said, nothing.
Others hastily generated a liberal supply
of prejudices and protested vigorously.
A prominent clergyman of this city was
among the last named. Among those who
acquiesced with Mrs. Atherton's views
were two young men, who entered into
a heated discussion with the divine as
to whether or not women should smoke,
vainly endeavoring to convince him that
it was the correct .thing: to do. The
clergyman soon, decided, for reasons best
known to himself, that he must go home
and, with adieux, departed, leaving Mrs.
Atherton to smoke without' further inter
ruption.
WIFE OF BISHOP OF KYOTO, WHO
IS VISITING' HER PARENTS. IN

"My Aunt Bridget" is the racy title of
a not less racy play that is to be the
Central's bill for the week. .Aunt Bridget
is an elderly and comfortably off Irish
dame with a spendthrift American nephew.
She. comes to New York, where her
nephew :has cast her as an amateur Prov
idence in his scheme of things. : She con
sents to Â¦Â¦ take the role ' until â¢ her nephew
begins to ' presume too much on her good
nature ' when she turns the â¢ tables ; upon
him in. a way that ; is ~ neatness itself.
There are to be a number of good special
ties and the piece will doubtless prove an
excellent drawing â¢ card.
"Zaza" has proved a- huge success at
the Alcazar Theater this week. Not for a
long season has the house had a produc
tion of such all-round merit. Miss Rob
erts in. the title role shows an advance
over her former work that places her ver,y
high- Indeed in the ranks of emotional
actresses and her work In the part has
attracted Eastern attention to her possi
bilities. White Whittlesey supports Miss
Roberts !with efficiency, and throughout
the cast is unusually effective. The set
tings leave nothing to be desired. Though
not food for babes, "Zaza" nevertheless
is a play with. a' moral that he who runs
may read. Its tendency is to righteous
ness, though its ways lie not therein, n
is realism of a. broad, though perfectly
possible sort, and can be seen with ad
vantage by both thoughtful and thpught
lessi All kinds of people have seemingly
made up their minds as to the necessity
for seeing it," as the seats are practically
sold out for the coming week. An extra
matinee to meet the demand will be given
on Thursday afternoon.
Another notable attraction of the
week is the "Romeo and Juliet" at the
Grand Opera-house that will initiate the
co-engagement of Edward Morgan and
Maude Fealy , at the I Mission-street
house. There . are all sorts of interest
attaching to the performance. Mrt Mor
gan, one of the powerful and popular ac
tors coming here, appears for tfie
first tfme in the classic drama. His'per
sonality is a strongly marked one, and
seemingly pervaded by the very essence
of modernity. From all that has before
been done by this actor it is safe to
prophecy something of an innovation in
his conception of Romeo. At any rate,
the interpretation have- the interest
of novelty, and possibly Mr. Morgan may
find therein the fittest outlet for his dis
tinctive energy. Neither is a new. Juliet
an every-day happening, and Miss Fea
ly's work .of the last few weeks has
promised a Juliet that will at least be
of charm and sweetness. The support
will be good, and the settings of the
usual handsome sort provided by tne
enterprising management. There are six
teen scenes in the play, and Mr. Acker
man announces, with excellent warrant,
that' they will be the most effective ever
provided for the play fn this city.
Next week is a new play, one whose
moral has created a lively discussion
wherever it has been givenâ "The- Gay
Lord Quex," that is one of the chef
d'oeuvres of the season. >.
Those interested in the best examples
of the . dramatic craft cannot afford to
miss a 6ingle performance given by this
eminent organization. The plays prom
ised during the season are all of strong
interest, and will add to the .play-goer's
repertoire most of the best that has late
ly been done in the dramatic world, be
sides older work that is worth revival.
To-night will begin the second week of
the Miller- Anglin engagement at the
Columbia Theater in "Trelawny of the
Wells." So popular was the play last
week, in spite of the unusually strong
competitive' attractions, that a second
.week, that is likely to prove e^ven. more suc
cessful than last, has been decided upon.
The Â¦ cast, as before said but cannot >6e
too often said, is throughout excellent.
Miss Anglin has a part that shows her
rich talent to a good deal of advantage,
and Mr. Miller's role, though not of the
largest, is distinctively effective. Others
to be noted are Mrs. Charles Walcot,
Charles Walcot, Mrs. Whiffen, Lawrence
D'Orsayi Grace Elllston, Walter Court
leigh, Lillian Thurgate and, indeed, ev
ery part in the cast is seen at its best.
The play is quaint, and contains some
delightful sketches of old-time players,
besides a pretty little plot and bright dia-"
logue. It is costumed in the elaborate
and once-fetching fashions of the early
sixties, and its settings are in a happy
key. i ' Â¦
Next week the farewell ' week of this
favorite company, "Wheels Within
Wheels" is programmed. The "bargain
matinees" on Thursday afternoon are still
a feature of the engagement.
Of the ladies, Miss Chapman, as usual,
easily leads. As the erring mother of the
adventurous Captain Swift she has a part
that demands good, careful playing, and
to) say that she fulfils all its requirements
is well within the mark. Gertrude Keller,
who succeeds Julia Dean In ingenue
parts, is a fresh and "pretty girl who
shows much promise, and who pleased
considerably as Mabel Seabrook. Mary
Elizabeth Forbes was a pretty Stella, if
not very agreeable from an elocutionary
standpoint, alid the rest of the cast filled
in acceptably., . , . *
The last week but one of the Neill Com
pany's â¢ engagement at the California
Theater is given over to "Captain Swift,"
whose first performance was given, last
night. Barring ,a little slowness In the
stage management Haddon Chamber'^
stirring play went very well, and was
appreciatively received by a good house.
Mr. Neill has the title role, and brings
a certain attractive sang-froid to the con
ception that goes far to' making his pic
ture of the fascinating adventurer con
vincing. It needs- yet more in the way
of snap and dash, however, "but the ex
igencies of . a first night performance
Gpubtless account for any small lack in
this directiqn. The portrait was conspic
uous, ,however, for the care and . con
science discernible in all that Mr. Neill
does, and with a little more speed and
spirit would be yet more acceptable.
iTank MacVicars does a manly and clean
sketch of Gardiner, a Queensland squat
ter, and Donald Bowles, -as a petulant
and jealous youth, is a taking youngster.
John W. Burton, as Seabrook, gives yet
another df â¢ his satisfying old men, and
Robert Morris is effective as the plotting
butler. .

Eleanor Falk, a vivacious young wo
man, and ten . fair maidens startled the
audience at the Orpheum last night by
appearing: in pajamas. The garment that
Is usuany worn f when retiring created
some consternation, but 'this feeling gave
way to one of wonder when the double
(imntette danced, ' Â» ' â¢ .
The best turn on the programme Is the
shooting that is done by Loris and Altina.
Besides being great shots the pair pos
sess great nerve. Altina stands before
the target a la William Tell with a glass
ball suspended three inches over her
head. Loria from the balcony fifty yards
away shatters the ball. The audience also
held its breath when Lioris shattered glass
balls that Altina held in her upraised,
hands and on her head. They do mar
velous shooting and deserve the apprecia
tive applause they receive.- 'â¢ . â¢ ' .
Jehan Bedlni does some clever juggling.
He Is assisted by Arthur, a colored com
edian, who smashes enough dishes. ' to
stack a china closet. Their act is very
funny. The Meredith Sisters sing and
dance cleverly. Howard Chambers is suf
fering from a cold, but nevertheless sings*
unusually well. Cushman, Holcombe and
Curtis scored a big hit in their greatest
success "The New Teacher." The Com
eciy is extremely funny and the singing
of the trio is above the average. Barton
and Ashley open the show with a funny
sketch. Barton makes a -good" tramp, but
Ashley is still too dramatic. Swan and
Bambard, "eccentric, grotesque and acro
batic comedians," live up to the title given
them dn the programme. The American,

'.. T>. Walsh's up-country greyhound Sac
ramento Boy proved the fleetest . of the
dogs at present in training yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. He duplicated his
performance of last week, winning the
special event from fast company.. .
He defeated, in turn. Tame Tralee, Roy
al Archer, Old Ironsides, Tralee Boy
and, in the diciding course. Homer Boy.
He beat the latter dog by a score of
6 to 0. . ;
Palo Alto, one of the over-night favor
ites, was beaten by Flying Fox In the
first round: Palo Alto was made a 1
to 5 choice over the Curtis crack. At
the first attempt each .dog scored the
same number of points, and were sent
back to the slips. Owing to the severe
trial Palo Alto had two weeks ago it
was not expected he would be able to
repeat. The bettors then made Flying
Fox favorite. He justified the confidence
of his backers by shutting out Palo Alto
pointless in a >Rort course.
Aeolus came f out after a long retirement
and won the class reserve event. He
proved the clas3 of the stake, and won
cleverly. In the concluding course he
met Cloudburst, a greyhound recently
sent from the East by John Chanton.
The latter gives promise of being a h.gh
class performer.- -
The puppy stake was won by Miranda,
It .was the general opinion, that Consort
was the best > in the stake, and that,
with a little coursing luck, j?he would
have won. In this stake Ginger Hill
surprised the bettors by defeating Flora
Belle, a 1 to 5 favorite. Ginger Hill
proved clever In -working the hare.
The consolation Btake was won by
A. R." Curtis' Narcissus. The detailed
results of the running, with Judge John

Many fast tennis matches were played
yesterday on the California, Park and San
Rafael courts. The best match on the lo
cal courts was that in which Sherwood
Adams and Orville Pratt were opposed to
Sam Hardy and Frank Stringham. Adam3
and Pratt played a strong game and beat
their opponents in a five-set match. The
last set was one of the longest of the sea
son, the score being 15 â 13. Hardy showed
a lack of practice and netted many balls.
Adams was easily the star- of the four.
The score: 6â3, 6â2, 4â6. 2â6, 13â13.

SAN FRANCISCO.
Pete Lohman, /McCreedie, Devereaux
and Dunleavy had the batting to them
selves. The first two hammered out three
safe swats apiece and the last two four
each. McCreedie has made twelve hits in
the last four games -and will soon be the
leader of the league.
The game, though woefully one-sided,' did
not lack startling plays and lively inci
dents. Holly made a sensational catchJof
Lohman's hard drive to right field. In the
ninth, when the Ponies had the bases all
occupied,' Josh Rellly banged . one Â¦ to ; left
that looked good for three bases.
Schmidt started to sprint and made
a great one-handed catch, shutting
off ' three Â¦ runs. â¢ McCreedie >Â¦ Â¦ threw
Rellly out' from * right field .' in the
second. Poor Josh hit . the ; ball hard all
the time and was simply â¢ robbed out . of
four clean swats. . Mohler and Devereaux
did the other stunts, by phenomenal
catches., The score: .
The game began like a pretty contest.
Two errors by the Oakland infield gave
the locals a tally the first shake-up. Oak
land began by gracefully hammering out
three In their half of the â¢ first . and two
more hi the third. In the sixth, the long
brewing trouble boiled over and commenc
ed to bubble up, taking the form: of five
runs on four clean hits. It eased down in
.the next round, but was working overtime
in the eighth, when' the slaughter wag re
sumed with renewed activity, five more
circuits and five more safeties going to
"fatten the averages of the leaders. .
It would be an impossible task to inter
pret to the fans who were among the
missing how the commuters ever man
aged to put so many men over, the rubber.
It was simply a case of batting the little
white object all over. the lot whenever the
occasion seemed ripe for a few runs. They
generally came in bunches of . four, but
sometimes only, one was made, in order
to give those present a chance to think
about what might have happened had
â¢Ewing given the familiar high sign.
,g ... ASEBALL history repeated itself
__)) yesterday at Oakland and also at
""""^v the grounds on the flat. Oak
', tMS J^ land repeated its usual Sabbath
performances, making the
strengthened Ponies victims in two con
tests. These were written on the books
as ball games, but imprinted on the minds
of thousands of fans as slaughtering par
ties. It was an Oakland day from the
ring of the first bell: The results were:
Morning, 8 to 1; afternoon, 15 to 4.
The closing of the past week brings no
change .in the relative standing of , the
four clubs.* Oakland is still many leagues
to the good, while Los Angeles profited by
the weak condition of the Senators by in
creasing its hold on second place. The
Ponies,- by splitting evetl with the lead
ers-,' stand as they did last week. Sacra
mento is worse off than ever before, which
is a harsh thing to say, considering' the
few good points left to their credit.
Fully 8000 . ardent admirers of , baseball
occupied seats and standing room at Rec
reation grounds yesterday afternoon, hop
ing to see the locals hand the leaders a
package of disaster. It was not so, how
ever. Ewing's commuters began to take
many and varied rides on Chimmie Wha
len's kind offerings and after nine rounds
had been reeled off, fifteen Oakland celeb
rities had . done a quick step to home
while the bottom of the base hit column
footed up an. even twenty. .. :
The mysterious south-wing curve passer,
Bill Cristall, stood on the slab for Ewing.
The way he pitched ball and was support
ed by that peerless infield was marvelous.
Not a single hit was made off his deliv
ery for five Innings, when the old favor
ite, Nordyke, managed to push one. past
Devereaux. Chimmie Whalen secured a'
double in the eighth. In the final spasm,
the clever southpaw let down long enough
to allow three runs and a like quantity of
safe, wallops.

During the week a meeting of the sub
scribers to the fund for building The
Challenger, will be held,. at which it will
be decided what disposition is to be made
of her. It is possible she will be sold to
a partnership consisting. of W. G. Morrow
and some friends. James Kitterman, who
contributed largely to the construction
fund, is said to be in favor of the speedy
sloop being owned by the club â¢
The United States transport Rosecrans
and the tug Slocum created considerable
commotion among the yachts at Sausa
lito on Saturday, the former fouling the
sloop Halcyon and dragging her away
from her moorings. The yacht fortunate
ly escaped serious damage.
The Corinthian fleet was represented, by
the sloops Harpoon, Presto, Mischief, the
yawls Afcturus and Spray- and several
others. The flagship Thelma and the
sloop Jessie E of the California Yacht
Club dropped anchor in a cove near Cali
fornia City. The schooners Inter Kos
and Magic also brought large parties to
tho cove. The Challenger, with W. G.
Morrow, W. M. Edgell, A. G. A. Mueller,
R. M. Welch and others, cruised from
Sausalito to the city front, thence to Mis
sion Rock and Goat Island and thence to
the upper bay.
There was a large gathering of yachts
and yachtsmen yesterday in
Cove. The San Francisco Yacht Club
was represented by the flagship Thetis,
the sloop Surprise, the schooner Chispa,
the yawl Phyllis and the sloops Juanlta,
Anita, Halcyon, Rover, Queen, Alice and

HAxxannn is a surprise.
The struggle was magnificent At this
inomont another surprise was given by
Maximum, which rushed forward and
seemed. to be overtaking the two leaders.
To see these three horses, their heads al
most together, fly past the post was thrill
ing, and the struggle called forth the
cheers of the crowd. Kizit-Kougan won
by a short head. The cheering continued,
although the victory was not a popular
one. Retz and Maximum ran a dead heat
for second place. Arizona was fourth, Al
varez fifth and Sceptre sixth, along dis
tance behind Alvarez. The owner of
Kizit-Kougan. M. de Stalyer, was
summoned by President Loubet and re
ceived the congratulations which are cus
tomary upon this occasion.
The bettingâ Kizit-Kougan 12 to L Retz
5 to 4, Maximum 25 to 1, Sceptre 3 to L
The contest for the Grand Prix was the
fourth in the series. A shower came just
before it was run, and resulted in the
opening of numberless umbrellas. Luckily
the rain ceased when the bell was rung
lor the start. In the preliminary canter
Sceptre naturally monopolized the atten
tion of the crowd. The filly's almost fault
less gTace and easy action excited^ the
greatest admiration. Counting Sceptre,
there were ten horses. These, with their
jockeys, were: Retz, Stern; Maximum,
Laneâ¢ Kizit-Kougan, . Pratt; Arizona,
Thorpe; Olivarez, Watkins; Kakimono,
Maher, Rob Roy, Mclntyre; Astrome II,
Henry; Lognes. Reiff; Bahyrousouf, Rig
by.
The horses were sent away to a good
Etart at the first attempt. Arizona made
tin running and was followed by Kaki
mono, Lognes and Olivarez. Upon reach
ing the middle distance Retz took third
place. Kizit-Kougan send Sceptre were
together among the last horses which
turned into the slope. Retz then drew up
level with Arizona. Sceptre also made an
effort, to work up, but ' gained little
gTound, and falling behind was practical
ly out of the remainder of- the race. The
two leading horses turned together Into
the homestretch, and Stern whipped Retx
cbead. It was expected, this horse would
win easily, and the crowd began to cheer,
Â¦when Kizit-Kougan suddenly burst from
the group and went after Retz.
SCEPTBE IS AMIIBED.
American jockeys were not successful
in the contest. Six had mounts, but not
one of them secured even a place. Amer
icans at Liongchamps lost much money
on the horses ridden . by J. Reiff and
Henry. The former jockey was mounted
on Lognes. third favorite at odds of 8
to 1, and which finished last. Throughout
the day, however, the American riders
rode three winners, five seconds and two
thirds. "* '--'Â¦â¢ ;
The racing began at 2 o'clock in the af
ternoon. The Prix du Armonville was
won by Lizette, J. Reiff up; Jacob, ridden
by Rlgby, was second, while, Nivermas,

Opera Singer Killed by a Car.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 15.â Arthur

ber of the Castle Square Opera Company,
playing an engagement in this city, wai
struck and killed to-night by a street car
at the corner of Euclid and Austin ave
nues.
PORTLAND, Or., June 15.â Harry Tracy
and David Merrill, the convicts who es
caped from the Oregon penitentiary a
week ago, after killing- * three guards,
crossed the Columbia river to-day and
went into the State of Washington. They
are now more than sixty miles away from
the Oregon penitentiary and are in the
vicinity of Merrill's heme, in Clarke coun
ty. Wash. They were hunted by bloou
hounds and a posse of 200 men, including
three companies of militia, for four days,
but for the past two days the fugitives
have been allowed to travel unmolested,
the organized hunt having been given up
last Friday night.
This morning word came that two
horses and a wagon had been stolen from
Kandall's farm, near Oregon City, fifteen
miles south of this city, and that It was
vbelieved Tracy and Iderrill took them.
Flbout 4 o'clock this afternoon - Charles
'Holtgrieve, a farmer, living on the Co
lumbia River, about six znfles from this
city, rode into town and announced that
iie had rowed Tracy and Merrill across
the Columbia River shortly after noon.
HOLD UP FIVE MEN.
They landed on the Washington shore
about five miles above Vancouver and
started for the mountains north of there.
Before reaching the Columbia two sloughs
had to be crossed, and the fugitives held
up a man at each crossing, compelling
him to procure a boat and take them
across. They took the two men with them
to the Boltgrieve ranch, where they found
three others.
They made all five men get into the boat,
Tracy and Merrill occupying the stern,
Â¦with a rifle In their hands. When the
Washington shore was reached they or
dered their boatmen to return Immediate
ly to the Oregon shore,
As soon as the news reached this city.
Detectives Day and Kerrigan and Sheriff
Cook of Clackamas County set out for
Vancouver, where they were joined by
Sheriff J. Lu Marsh of Clarke County,
Wash., and about twenty men. The posse
etarted northeast, hoping to head off the
lugitives before they reach the mountains.
Merrill was born in Clarke County and
has lived there and In Cowlitz County
most of his life. He is thoroughly fami
liar with the country in the two counties,
a large portion of which Is a veritable
jungle. If the fugitives succeed in reach
ing the mountains there will be a slim
chance of capturing them. /
TALKS WITH THE CONVICTS.
A telephone message received from Van
vouver. Wash., at 11:30 o'clock to-night
eaid that Tracy arl)3. Merrill were met by
Ralph Leiser, who was riding a bicycle,
about five miles from there. Leiser said
that he talked with the men and that
they eaid they were the fugitives wanted.
Turnstile Records Show Phenomenal Attendance Dur=
ing First Afternoon and Evening.
C^ AKLAND, June 15.â Twenty-five
V thousand people surged through
H the Elks' Fair grounds yester
f day and last night. How did
â^ they all get there, people of
the crowd asked, and whence
did they all come? "No matter where
they came from," various Elks reply,
"they were there and we brought them,
even if we never dreamed there would bo'
such a crowd in the whole week.
Never before in Oakland's history did
sa many people as gathered last night oc
cupy the same space at the same time.
As some one said in the thick of it, if
they had been sardined they couldn't
have been packed any closer. If you got
your hands up you couldn't have got
them down, and if you had them down
you wouldn't have wanted to get them
up. It would have been a bad place for
a highwayman to have said "Hands up}"
because nobody would have acquiesced,.
even at the pistol's point.
The crowd was very good-natured, too.
It was tickled, seemingly, at having been
surprised. It was pleased because It got
a good deal more than It gave. It said i
fine things about the arrangements and
complimented the Elks' management
SUPER VISORS OF PLACER . >
WILL TALK OF "HOPPERS"
AUBURN, June 15.â The Supervisors of
Placer County will meet to-morrow to
take action in conjunction with the Sac
ramento Supervisors relative to the grass
hopper raid at Roseville. Adolph Schno
bel, one of the largest orchard owners
In the infested section, says he fears but
little damage, while, on the other hand,
C. W. Threlkeld, a large vineyardlst, says
he has lost 3000 vines already. Tho people
are thoroughly aroused, but the District
Attorney will advise the Supervisors that
they have no jurisdiction. Most people
believe it within the province of the
County Board of Horticulture, but that
body has refused to assume the responsi
bility of burning the infested pasture

TAILS TO. RECOGNIZE
] HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER
Most,, liberally patronized* among the
concessions was the Elks' country store.
Everybody ' bought a consignment at the
store and a throng was' about it all the
time, waiting to get a surprise package.
Ten cents bought a number and the num
ber corresponded with a package and the
package became the purchaser's. The
parcels contained â¢ many strange things,
some of them quite extraordinary. They
might be anything from a plow to a
ELKS' STOBE THE THING.
The spectacle was likened by many peo
ple to a picture of the pastâ the Midwin
ter Fair. And the show, with its fantas
tic scenes and bizarre effects, did make
tills fair look like a miniature to its by
gone predecessor.
There were a thousand temptations for
the prodigal, and to shut the ear to the
importunities of the sirens of the Midway
was an Impossible feat. Money was of
little value anyway. The man with hla
wife and babies and the fellow with hin
girl were alike improvident. They took
In and were taken in by everything that
came along. If one show didn't meet the
fancy, why, they just passed on to the
next and said, "It's only .10 cents; what's
the difference?" ' : '.
School building two great searchlights
sent their uncanny eyes peering into the
secrets and recesses of the crowd.

The facilities for getting icto the
grounds were about as complete as human
ingenuity could make them. In* spite of
the impatient thousands knocking for ad
mission through the imposing gateway on
Eleventh street, there was no crowding,
no pushing, no mauling. The ticket of
fices out on the street provided tickets as
fast as two doze/i hands could pass them
out, and then a half-dozen turnstiles,
with their capacldus maws wide open, de
voured the tickets and ticket-holders. In
this way 25,000 people got into the grounds
during the day.
BRILLIANT ILLITMINATION.
The taste displayed in the lighting ef
fects and their extent were sources of
wonder to everybody. Myriads of incan
descent lights shed their rays upon the
heads of the multitude. They studded
thickly the arch covering' the main gate
way. They climbed to the tops of tall
flagpoles. They outlined buildings. From
massive white pillars equidistant about

GREAT GROTESQUE PARADE.
The police arrangements were in har
mony with the rest of the fair's manage
ment and the Elks' county jail was over
crowded most of the day. Policemen go
out and grab a man for walking on the
grassâ a very difficult thing to keep off of

ho either pays a fine or stays until he
does. Policemen are liable to grow
alongside of you for the slightest infrac

â¢ Piedmont" Sulphur Springs is repre
sented by/ one of the prettiest exhibits on
the grounds. Great rocks from the hills
have been piled high and down their
sides trickle tiny streams of water. ; A
hollow in the face of one of the bowlders
is filled with water restrained by a plate
of glass, behind which colored lights play
upon golden fish.- The whole is inclosed
by a canopy of limbs and greens.
On the Midway there Is a grand display
of spellers and other monstrosities. The
three-legged cow, the hirsute girl, the
pedal penwoman, the snake-charmer, the
lion tamer, the contortionist and the tali
man all vie for the favor of the crowds.
The spieler spits out in a mongrel voice
the various attractive attributes of his
show, and the victim pays 10 cents, "or
one dime," to have his curiosity satiated.
It is all very pleasing and the crowd is
satisfied .with the Midway.

The Reliance circus was overburdened
with people seeking admission' to its. per
formances. The end of the day showed
receipts from 1500 people for -five per
formances. It is worth a good deal more
than the price of admission, too, this
circus, and the separation from his dime
brings no regrets from ' the spectator.
There is a slack wire "turn," a double
trapeze act, juggling, club swinging,
tumbling and bare-back riding and all
other doings that a modern circus is heir
to. The committee in charge consists of
Captain Fred Elsey, Charles Elsey Jr.,
Louie A. Lefever, Paul T. Carroll, Phil H.
Rosenheim, Ed" J. Smith, Fred Winter,
Walter Cole and J. M. Jellett. Club
Superintendent Walter B. Fawcett is
general manager.
The Elks have on- exhibition a parent
elk of the dumb varietyâ a monarch of
the forest. He was killed in Washington
several years ago and is supposed to have
been ' the largest elk ever slain. He
weighs 900 pounds. His wife and two
children are with him. You pay 10 cents
to see them and get a glass of soda water
thrown in.

LION CRUSHES AHM.
Cld Circus Man Is Attacked by En-
raged Animal.
' OAKLAND, June 16.â William J. Clay,
an employe of the trained lion concession
at the Elks' Fair, almost had his arm bit
ten off by one of , the lions to-night.
Clay was feeding the lions and doing
hla usual work about the cages, when
one of the animals, . with a snarl, snapped
at him. His left arm waa within the cage
at the time and the lion caught it fairly
between his teeth, Inflicting two ugly
wounds where the Jaws closed over the
arm, lacerating and crushing the flesh.
Clay was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where it was found necessary to
take nine stitches in one of the bites and
five in the other.
The wounds were specially treated In
order to prevent poisoning. The doctors
say that the only danger now is from
blood poisoning, but that the wonder is
that Clay did not lose his arm.
Clay is an old-time circus and men
agerie man and has traveled with wild
animal shows for thirty years.
WASHINGTON, June 15.â The Navy
Department does not Intend to be caught
napping, as' it was when the war with
Spain was declared. =It. is proposed not
only to place the nation's warships in
the highest state of efficiency* so they
may be immediately ready for active ser
vice should the emergency arise, but to
prepare still further the coast defenses
to withstand the entrance of any hostile
fleet into ports of the United States.
Two orders which have been issued by
he Navy Department disclose what im
portant work the general board of tho
navy has been engaged in of late.. These
orders read: 3- ' ; ~ *j'^\
"Rear Admiral P. H. Cooper is placed
in charge of preparations for war in the
district extending from Chatham Light,
Cape Cod, to Barnegat Light, N. J."
"Rear Admiral L. Kempff is ordered to
San Francisco, Cal., to take charge of
preparations for war in the Pacific
Coast district, extending from Puget
Sound to the. Mexican border."
The general scheme for the defensive
measures has been prepared by the gen
eral naval board, details of which hay*
been left to these officers to work out.
The coast line, according to the general
plan, is to be divided into four districts
for naval defense, just as was done dur
ing the Spanish war. One district will
comprise the whole Pacific Coast, whirÂ»
the others will cover the Atlantic and
Gulf States. The two to which officer*
have been assigned will be used as models.
They will be thoroughly organized before
attention is given to the others. In addi
tion a thorough understanding will be
reached with the different States whereby
the naval reserves will know in advance
what is expected of them should war be
declared against the United States.
It is contemplated also that the army
shall co-operate with the navy, since the
War Department controls the coast de
fenses, whose employment necessarily
must be in harmony with the operations
of the naval forces. .Already the mili
tary authorities have expressed a desire
for full co-operation with the navy.
Captain Randolph, chief of the artillery
corps, has Invited the joint participation
of the army and navy in a mimic war
that is to be waged off Long Island dur
ing the summer. The details for the
scheme for defense, of course, will be
kept secret. .

NEW BEVOLVEB RECORD
IS CLAIMED FOR HHTKLE
At an early hour this morning Emmet
Pesoza, a Mexican, was found lying on
the sidewalk at Eleventh . and Railroad
avenues, South San Francisco, with a bul
let wound in his stomach. He' was found
by two boys and at the time he was con-
? cl0U t:,c Iie was ren ioved at once to Mc-
I^'ughlins drug store, where everything
possible was done for his relief. While
he was at the drug store he was ques
tioned as to the shooting, but refused to
make a statement, shortly lapsing Into
unconsciousness.
The shooting is shrouded In mystery.
Ivo one in the neighborhood of Eleventh
and Kailroad avenues heard the shot
fired. Owing to the lateness of- the hour
.jMithing could bÂ« learned concerning Pe-
Trza s whereabouts previous to the time
he was found on the sidewalk by the
boys. The boys were not able to give the
fclightest information. They said that they
were on their way home when they made
the discovery.
Pesoza was subsequently removed to
the Central Emergency Hospital.- where
an examination of the wound in his stom
ach was made. The injury Is very serious
and it is feared that if he does not suc
cumb to the shock and the loss of blood,
blood poison will set in.
Subsequently the police- arrested Joseph
Guadaloupe of 1222 Fourteenth avenue.
South, on suspicion of being the man
who shot Pesoza. He was taken to the
Seventeenth Street Station by Officer
O'Coimell. Guadaloupe is the stepfather
of Pesoza.
COAST DEFENSE
ON WAR FOOTING
Mrs. Skinner is the wife of r>. E. Skin
ner, president of the Federal Salt Com
pany of San Francisco. It was known
that one of the horses driven to-day was
a dangerous animal, but Mrs. Skinner*
being herself an expert horsewoman, al
ways liked to drive behind spirited horses
and told her friends there was no danger.
William Eden, a local undertaker, vÂ»
driving- along; at the time and ran to the
rescue of the lady. He succeeded in stop
ping the runaway horses and assisted tho
coachman in getting Mrs. Skinner from
under the wreckage. She was unconscious
and badly cut about the head and body.
Eden drove back to the. almshouse and
telephoned to Dr. Wickman of this city.
William Jones, the poorfarm manager,
hitched up his team and spring wagon
In the meantime and the injured lady way
brought to her home in this city. It waa
found by the physician that one of her
limbs was broken in two places. Her body
was badly bruised also and it is feared
that she has suffered internal injuries.
Her recovery Is doubtful. .
Several physicians are in consultation
to-night and everything possible Is being
done to allay her suffering. Her child was
slightly bruised. O'DonneU, the coach
man, was severely cut about the head and
arms and is also suffering from severÂ©
bruises. ".
SAN RAFAEL.. June - 13.â Mrs. Â£>. E.
Skinner had a narrow escape from deattL
to-day in a runaway accident and to-night
is in a precarious condition.
Mrs. Skinner and her little boy -went
out riding about 9;30 this morning in d.
trap , drawn by two horses and handle*!
by her coachman. John CDonnell. The*
animals were fractious at the start, but:
after traveling several miles ' became less*
nervous. The accident occurred on the?
boulevard between this city and the coim
ty almshouse, where the read Is quit*
circuitous and narrow in ' places. Tha
horses were traveling at a. slow trot when
a rabbit jumped out of the brush from,
the side, of the road and frightened the
cno on fhe oft side.
The horse jumped clear over the pola
of the trap and so frightened the other
horse that they both tried to run off.
Being unable to get away they wheeled
quickly and overturned the trap, throwing
the occupants violÂ«ntly to the ground.
Mrs. Skinner fell underneath the vehicle
and her child, a boy about four years old.
landed on the side of the road. The coach
man was also caught by the overturned!
rig. The animals being thoroughly fren
zied, by this time dragged the trap along
the road and Mrs. Skinner beneath it. .

It is quite commonly the case that both

troubled with coffee drinking.
A lady writes and, after giving descrip-

dyspepsia and general nervous trouble,
ears: "I was almost as bad as he, having
the headache nearly every day, and was
nervous and tveak, did not sle'ep well, was
pale and thin and had a bad complexion.

SAN FRANCISCO. June 13â3 p. m.
LAFAYETTE, Ind., June 15.â The Tip
pecanoe Battlefield Association held its
annual exercises in the tabernaoie at the
battleground to-day. Special. trains on all
roads were run and an immense crowd
attended. The graves of th^ men who
fell at the battle of Tippecanoe were
beautifully decorated. An address was
delivered by Henry Watterson, eGitor of
the Louisville Courier- Journal, bis sub
ject being "Heroes. In Homespun." Wat
terson was accompanied to the battle
ground by a committee of fifty prominent
citizens. At the conclusion of the cere
monies on the battlefield the party re
turned to the city, where Watterson was
banqueted at the Lafayette Club and a
reception was held. - â¢
Decorate the Graves of Heroes.
After that, it Is alleged, they manipu
lated the Orphan stock without the knowl
edge of the holders in such a manner as
to secure control, sold it to themselves
as the Empire State Company for J108.00U
and immediately organized the new com
pany with stock valued at $312,500.
The suit grows out of the sale of the
Orphan group to the Empire State Com
pany last year, when the stockholders of
the Orphan Company were forced to ac
cept about 8 cents a share on their hold
ings. It i3 charged that Williams and his
associates mined In the Orphan property,
presumably from the Isabella, and after
discovering a large body of ore sealed it
up without apprising the stockholders of
the find.

Charges of fraud are made by Josef K.
Elchern in a suit filed , in the District
Court against Nelson B. "Williams, George
B. Killbourne and others in control of the
Empire State Mining Company on Bull
Hill, and the court is asked to appoint a
receiver for the Empire State Company
and the Orphan Bell Company, to restrain
shipments from the Empire, to cancel the
deed wherein the Orphan- property Is
transferred to the Empire State and to
prevent a prospective consolidation of the
Empire and Isabella companies.

The local Shriners were bidding their
fellow Shriners farewell yesterday. Hun
dreds of the pilgrims shook the dust of
this oasis from their feet and are now
Journeying southward and eastward. Im
perial Potentae Akin and a party of
twenty-five, not including a dozen or
more Shriners of Islam Temple of this
city, left on a special train for Los An
geles at 3 o'clocK p. m. The party will
arrive at Los Angeles to-morrow, and
until Wednesday will be. the guests of
Al Malaikah Temple of the southern
city. The imperial special will return
here on Thursday and proceed directly
to Portland and Seattle, whence, affer
two or three days of fraternal visiting,
the Nobles will proceed homeward over
the northern route.
The members of El Jebel Temple of
Denver, together with Cook's band, left
for Colorado yesterday morning. The
band and drum corps played several live
ly â¢ airs as they marched to the ferry,
where a number of local Shrlners bade
them bon voyage. The Nobles of El
Jebel carried with them the trophy won
by them in the prize drill last Thurs
day, and they promised to display it
conspicuously on their arrival home. All
the members of this temple speak in the
highest terms of the hospitality of San
Francisco, aa was evidenced by their
warm reception and treatment while in
this city.
The pilgrims from Lo* Angeles to the
number of 100 left for their homes yes
terday morning, and at 3 p. m. 200 more
followed them. The scene at Third and
Townsend streets was a lively one prior
to the departure of the Shriners. Zuh
rah Nobles from Minneapolis, headed by
Captain Shuey. also left for L/os An
geles, where they will remain till Wednes
day, when they will return to this city
on their way to Portland. After a day
spent in that city the Zuhrahites will
go to Seattle for a. brief stay, and thenee
homeward via the northern route.
FAREWELLS SPOKEN.
.The headquarters of Al Kadar Temple,
at the Lick, where so much melted snow
was dispensed during the week, was
closed for good and aye yesterday. The
Portland Shriners are now on their way
north, but the liberality with wljlch they
dispensed their so-called "melted snow
from Mount Hood, 95,000 years old," made
them many friends in this city. There
is a lurking suspicion in the minds of
local Shriners wno had the privilege of
drinking some of this melted snow that
the brethren from Portland had handed
out a gold brick, and that the snow had
received a Bourbon bath . before being
shipped to San Francisco. It is certain
that the effect upon those who drank
more than good judgment warranted was
identical with that which accompanies
a night spent out with the boys.
After. many days of extraordinary ac
tivity all those who were connected with
the Shrlner festival of last week took
a day - off. - and rested yesterday. The
various headquarters at the hotels were
closed.', and the scenes of festivity and
merriment which were so conspicuous
therein during the, past seven days were
sadly lacking. Red fezzes and bebadged
Shrlners had secreted their parapherna
lia,-and all those who were not seeking
repose were making preparations to
leave this oasis for the more familiar
ones in the far distance. The fires of
enthusiasm had burned themselves out,
and all that remained was the ashes of
satiety and that' tired feeling which at
tends the strenuous in all human af
fairs.

A yachting party came very nearly
meeting death in the bay yesterday after
noon. It was about 1:30 o'clock when a

seas and strong breeze without mishap.
Members of the Dolphin Boat. Club, who
were at their clubhouse, were startled by
seeing the yacht Gazelle capsize.

succeeded in clinging to the capsized
yacht. T. R. Dixon, captain of th* Dol

reached the exhausted men who were be

saw his mother lying on the roof of the

There is an old wooden railing around the
roof and his mother had hung the blanket
on it to drv, instead of on the clothes line.
It is supposed that while leaning over tho
railing to feel if the blanket was dry, the
railing gave way and she was precipitated
to the roof below. When Dr. J. D. Hill,

summoned, arrived, he pronounced her

He was in the saloon, he said, and on
seeing Lahore enter the place invited him
to drink. "When Lahore refused he asked
him if he still carried a pistol to use on
him, when, without a word, Lahore shot
him.

through an interpreter and declared that
Lahore had shot him without provocation.
Lahore is a foreman in the fertilizing
works of Bayle, Lacoste & Co., at Fifth
avenue and M street, South San Fran

La Grange was employed as a laborer.
Lahore declares that he was forced to dis
charge La Grange because of his laziness
and frequent dfunken spells. Since his
discharge, so the foreman claims, La
Grange has made many threats against
him and that lately the threats were of
such character and so frequent that he
feared that his life was in danger. .; i

hore walked into the saloon where the
tragedy occurred and was accosted by- La
Grange and invited to drink. Lahore says
that he was not pleased with the manner
of the invitation and refused it. After, a

clares, and to protect himself he fired
twice at his assailant. Both shots took

recruited and commanded Company D.

meeting with W. TV. Ross of Sanborn,
Vail & Co., who was a private in his
company, and whom he had not seen
nor heard from for forty years. Captain
Cramer Is a prominent business man of
Rochester, and has a nephew living in

The Nobles of Mecca Temple, who
came here on the McGee special, left
Saturday for New York. They were fol
lowed by Rameses Temple of Toronto

to the banquet of Saturday evening was
a disappointment to local Shrlners, who
had counted upon entertaining the New

the sections named were pressed for time,
and that business interests rendered their
immediate return imperative., t
