SOME FEARFUL INJURIES.
"Some men from sinking ships got to
the shore, but they were burned up there.
At; no time was there any earthquake,
but big stones were rained down and fell
like rain for a long time." , ; >. . ; .
"That cloud," continued Prudent, "was
bigger, it seemed, than' the mountain.
The fire burned the city everywhere at
once. Near me I saw only- dead men, but
on shore I saw men. and women: rushing
back aÂ»d forth amid the flames for an
hour. They would not run long.' Then
came that choking smoke and they would
drop like dead flies. The explosion, smuko
arid fire all came and went in three min
utes, but the city burned for three hours.
Then every house was finished, anil noth
ing alive was left. -' Â¦' '
From the Italian ship Teresa Lovico
several men were saved, but they are in
a frightful state, except Jean Louis Pru
dent of St. Pierre. Although* on deck
and unprotected he/was little burned.
Prudent says there was first an awful
noise of 'explosion and then, right away,
a cyclone of ' smoke V and fire, . but such
was' the poisonous, choking nature" of the
smoke that it burned worse than Â¦ the
fire. When it struck the people they fell
dead. The cyclone of gas. tore the masts
out of ships, blew others up and sunk
some of them. Soon , afterward came a
wave of fire bigger than the smoke cloud.
too brave to be burned to death. Angelo
further asserted that the storm of fire
lasted not more than five minutes. Jo
seph Breckels, a seaman 50 years of age,
is so frightfully burned that he 'cannot
live, having inhaled flames. Other men
of the. Roraima who were rescued are
Salvador Acello and Joseph Suslno. .
ONRUSH OF THE FIRE.
Francisco Angelo, who speaks poor Eng
lish, vividly described* the bririish'bf fire."
He says the captain was -a brave; man,
Gus Linder, the quartermaster of the
steamer,, who is horribly â¢ burned . and can
hardly talk, confirmed this. V-
Ben Benson, the carpenter of the Ro
raima, â¢ said : "I was on deck amidships
when I heard the explosion. The cap
tain ordered me to up the anchor. I got
the windlass but when the fire came I
went into the forecastle and got my
clothes. When I came out I talked with
Captain Mauggah. Mr. Scott, the first of
ficer, and others. They had been on the
bridge. The captain was horribly burn
ed. He had inhaled flames and wanted to
jump into the sea. I tried | to make him
take a life preserver. The captain, who
was .undressed, jumped -overboard, and*
hung on to a line for a while, when he
disappeared."
"I never can forget the horrid", fiery,
choking whirlwind which enveloped me,"
eald Evans. I'Morris and L rushed below.
We are not very badly burnedâ not so bad
as most of them. When the fire came we
were going to our postsâ we are en
gineersâto weigh anchor and get out.
When we came up we found the . ship
afire aft and fought it forward until 3
o'clock, when the Suchet came to our res
cue. We were then building a raft."
The stories of the survivors added to
the awful details of the particularly har
rowing account of the. loss of the British
steamer Roraima. C. C. Evans of Mon
treal and John G. Morris of New York,
who are now at the military hospital of
Fort de France, say the vessel arrived at
6o|clock. As eight bells was struck a
frightful explosion was heard up the
mountain. â¢ The cloud of fire, toppling and
roaring, swept with lightning speed down
the mountain and over the town and bay.
The Roraima was nearly sunk and caught
fire at once. :
STORIES OF SURVIVORS.
At the request of A. McAllister, United
States Consul at Barbadoes, Captain Da
vis and the Solent were, placed at his dis
posal by the Barbadoes government. The
Solent arrived at about the same time-as
the Associated Press steamer and brought
to St". Pierre tho Colonial Secretary, two
civil doctors, two military officers and Dr.
W. E. Aughinbaugh of Washington, as
well as a corporal and four hospital or
derlies, three trained nurses and a full
field hospital outfit. The Barbadoes gov
ernment also sent 700 barrels . of provi
sions, one ton of ice and a full supply of
medicine. These were useful, but the dead
needed only quick burial. .
' A. G. Austen, a manager'of the Colonial
Bank of Barbadoes, landed at St. Pierre
with a party from the British Royal Mail
steamer Solent. He found the bank clock
stopped at some minutes before 8 o'clock.
A horse and buggy and a policeman were
in a dead group at the door. .
Careful inspection showed that the fiery
stream which so completely destroyed St.
Pierre must have been composed of pois
onous gases, which instantly' suffocated,
every one who. inhaled them, and of other
gases burning furiously, for nearly all the
victims had their hands covering their
mouths or were in some other attitude
showing that they had sought relief from
suffocation. All the bodies were carbon
ized or roasted.

In one corner twenty-two- bodies of men.

fire, were strewn in every direction. Huge
blocks and still hot stones were scattered
about. From under one large stone tho

"The President directs me to express to
you his wish that your departments go

Secretary Moody will - consider â¢ to-mor

Press dispatches this morning called at
tention to the unsuitableness of the- water
of Martinique for drinking purposes.
"It has occurred to the bureau that ref
ugees from the island of Martinique may
suffer for want . of water. Naturally the
surface water would be strongly impreg
nated with sulphur and is therefore.un
suitable for drinking purposes. There is
a good water barge at Key West, with, a
capacity of 175,000 gallons, ready. for im
mediate use. There is another at Norfolk,
with a capacity- of 400,000 gallons, ready
for immediate use. j They might be towed

I sprang overboard, thinking that I might

SPRINGS OVERBOARD.
"It soon became unbearably hot in. the
room, and I made up my mind that it
would be better outside. I went on deck
to find a scene which will never fade
from my mind. All about were lying the
dead and the dying. All were . covered
with hot mud and with ashes. The dying
were suffering terrible torture. Little
children were moaning for water. I did
what I could for them, but It was very
little.' I obtained water, but when it was
held, to their swollen lips they .were
unable to swallow because â¢ . of . the
ash'es which clogged their throats.
One little chap took water into ;hi3
mouth', and rinsed out the ashes, but even
then could not swallow, so badly was his
throat burned. He sank back uncon
scious and a few minutes later was dead.
"The ship rocked and I expected every
moment that it would sink. Outside I
heard a voice pleading for the door to be
opened. I recognized the voice as that
of Mr. Scott, the first officer, and I
opened the door and dragged him into the
room. When we did this the heat rushed
in blistering Thomas' face. We three and
Thompson, the assistant purser, and
sixty-eight souls, were the only ones who
escaped without serious injuries.
"Seeing the Roddam, which had ar
rived In . port soon after we anchored,
making for the Roraima, I said good-by
to Captain Muggah and swam to the
Roddam. Before I could reach her she
burst into flames and put out to sea. I

The Dixie will therefore visit St. Vin
cent as well as Martinique and Dominica
if that island has suffered. In view of the
failure of Lieutenant McCdrmick, com
manding the Potomac, to make any report
on conditions in Dominica, which island
he. touched to-day, it is believed that it
has not suffered any ill effects from the
earthquake. Rear , Admiral Bradford,
chief- of the bureau of equipment,, point
ed out to Secretary Moody in^ this mem-.
Thus the United States will by the lat
ter part of this week have four and pos
sibly five war vessels at Martinique, a
force which will be useful for the distri
bution of supplies and aiding in preserv
ing order. It Is presumed here that Con
sul Ayme's statement In his dispatch
that the presence of warships would be
valuable was made upon the suggestion
of the Governor of Martinique, who is
now believed to be alive. Undoubtedly
there is considerable looting and lawless
ness among the 50,000 homeless people,
and if the French authorities desire It
American ships will land bluejackets and
marines. Secretary Moody drew up care

They directed him to receive commissary

the mountains behind the town, which
were shrouded in darkness. Thunder
seemed to come out of the air and up

to keep the passengers below. All were
watching the awful sight spread out be

SCENES AT CLASS DAY EXER
CISES AT UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA.
BEN WEED'S amphitheater in the
woods back of the university
buildings at Berkeley was the
scene of the open-air production
yesterday by the graduating class
of '02, being a part of the "class
day" exercises.
A clever burlesque on the famous comic
opera "Robin Hood" was the presents
tion made by the students before one of
the largest gatherings ever seen in the
ampitheter. The arrangements werÂ«
perfect in detail, and the brilliantly col
ored gowns of thousands of fair visitors
formed a spectacle long to be remem
bered. Seats were provided in front of
the stage for invited guests of the grad
uates, and the general public found ac
commodations beneath . wide-spreading
trees.
The production of "Robin Hood" re
flected great credit on all concerned. The
various musical numbers were given in
superb style, and the score of the opera
was a keen satire on some of the faculty
and students of the State University.
The doings of President Wheeler ana
Recorder Sutton were burlesqued in a
good-natured manner by the students,
and the head of the university heartily
enjoyed his representation on the stage.
The many solos, choruses, dances and
merry Jests- were all encored, and the
work of Wilfred Yanke's orchestra and
the costumes were features of the proÂ»
duction.
PEESENTS A MERRY PLOT.
The plot of the burlesque of "Kobin
Hood," written by Lila McKlnne. was
set forth in the programme as follows:
Once Upon a time, a great while asoe, in
ye Berkeley forest, there was a good t'eUowe
lived, who was Robin Hood, and with him his
companions of 1S>O2. On a time they had lived
elsewhere, but they had been tormented by
divers oppressors, so knavish that all did com
plaine of them. Of these ye most churlish was
ye wicked Sutton of Southall. They strove
against them all, but this helped little or noth
ing. So that they were constrayned to travail
away. So they did goe to Berkeley Forest
toe be free.
Of a day Robin and his good fellowes did
set themselves to make merrie, howbeit they
were tolde that ye wicked Sutton of Southall
was coming on that same day to drive them
from ye greenwoode. Arid soe they did sende
men for ye maydens, Mayd Marian, and all
ye maydens of 1002 to make merry with them.
Of that same day it was Robin's chance,
some of his fellowes walking thorow ye woode
should find a gallant knight. Sir .Ben of
Wheeler. Robin and his merrie men did make
him welcome, and bade him joyn in ye merrie
ment. And 60 they made him welcome.
And soon did come ye maydens. and they
frolicked with Robin and his band; and so
did they pass ye day in merriment* and Sir
Ben of Wheeler did joyn in it all.
They all made merrie, till, of a sudden, ye
wicked Sutton of Southall did come with his
guard for to drive ye goode fellowes from ye
forest. And he Bayed: "Now will I cool your
hot blood. Master Robin; you shall this day
leave ye greenwoode."
Te merrie men were in great terror of mind,
but they were stayed by ye gallant knight,
who spake to ye Sutton thus:
"If thou dost strive against this bande,
I vow to drive thee from this lande.
For I am notte Sir Ben of Wheeler, but Ben
jamin Ide, Klnge of ye/ Berkeley Forest. I
have beheld ye harmless prankes of these goode
folkes, and their mannie virtues. I have been
beholden to them for kindly welcome. Thou
spot and the success of the Berkeley
athletes. . He was followed by Miss
Mary Jewett, who said that it was diffi
cult to eay good-by to the university.
She called upon one of the "steps" to
speak for her and the crowd was enter
tained by a graphophone speech tha| was
very amusing. The speech of "one of the
steps" told of the entry of the fair, co
eds into university life and how *ie young
ladies had exerted a good influence upon
their sterner comrades and helped them
to be men in every sense of the. word.
The graduates .and their friends then
marched â¢ â¢ to the Mechanics' building
where the speech of farewell was made
by I. B. Rhodes. He reviewed the work
of the graduates and expressed thanks for
them to their instructors.
At the Mining building the speech was
made by Frank Baird, who said that
though there was sorrow in parting there
was also Joy, because of the strong ties
of friendship that would bind the gradu
ates in the years to come. He trusted
that all would go forth determined to win
and be an honor, to the University of
California.
.GIRL GRADUATES GATHER. â¢
At the Chemistry building the exercises
were in charge of Dozier Finley and J.
B. Newland. The usual amusing "ex
periments" were carried out and the man
ner in which "water" was analyzed and
"food" made out of "nitrogen" kept the
visitors in a constant state of laughter.
. The "pilgrimage" concluded with' a
gathering at Hearst Hall, tne home of
the fair co-eds. On the arrival of the
procession the girl graduates grouped
themselves on the lawn, forming a pretty
picture of California's daughters. After
singing a college 'song, entitled "I'm- "so
very tired," Miss Grace Woods addressed
the assemblage. She . said that men
might delight, in banquets, but none
knew the delight of the "jinks" held in
the quarters of the co-eds. She spoke of
the beauties of the friendships formed by
the co-eds and referred to the. memory of
Professor Le Conte and all who had
helped to make happy the student days of
her. comrades. She Â«oncluaed by saying
that the meetings in the hall had formed
ties that would be of great value in after
life and that never could be severed.
. The graduates and their friends then
dispersed and the "pilgrimage" of the
cla,Â£3 of '02 became a thing of the past.
Those in charge of the morning exercises
were as follows: D. A. Holley, W.\R.
Root, J. J. Earle, George Lorenz, Misses
Grace Boggs; Frances Vic Carter, -^liza- !
beth Hermann and Lillian Knowles.
hast taken more power than thou shouldst.
These eoode people shall yette dwelle here;
but for his misdeeds, do thou. good Robin,
punishe him."
Thus were they freed from this rufnn, ana
they did punishe him for his wickednesse.
And all his crying was in vayne. And so they
did abide free in ye greenwoode, and no more
wicked knaves tormented Robin and ye goode
fellowes and maydjfens of 1902.

ance were designated as follows:

Faculty Is Satirized by "Seniors" in Burlesque
of Comic Opera "Robin Hood," Which Is Cleverly
Given Beneath the Trees of University Grounds
OTCCE again a band of sturdy young
men and bright women has bidden
farewell to the halls of the State
University at Berkeley and with the
ceremonies attending "Class Day"
the graduating class of '02 yesterday
followed the custom of years in terminat
ing the days of scholastic training.
Although the day was cloudy, a large
crowd assembled under the broad oaks
of the campus and the graduating stu
dents and their friends held high revelry.
The young men and women who were to
bia good-by to their alma mater and en
ter the campaign of life were in the best
of spirits and the scene was one of the
most brilliant ever witnessed in the
grounds of the State Beat of learning.
The young women, who to-morrow will
receive their certificates from the hands
of the faculty, were gowned in white,
â¢while the graduating male students
donned white duck garments and wore
their battered class hats. The junior
classes enjoyed themselves at the com
mencement of the proceedings by play
ing "football" with the new headgear
they wore for the first time as "seniors,"
and the more battered the "hat the more
it was prized by the owner.
The "pilgrimage" of the class of '02 con
sisted of a concert under the "senior
cak;" the dedication of the oak to the
care of the class of '03, and the speeches
delivered on the steps of the various halls
of the university, each of which was vis
ited. An open air performance in the
woods was given in the afternoon and at
night the graduates danced the hours
away and made plans for the future.
VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP.
A feature of the speeches delivered dur
ing the day was the strong sentiment ex
pressed as to the value of friendship and
association begun by young men and
women during their college career. The
graduates who gpoke, and President
Wheeler also, dwelt upon this phase of
etudent life, and the class of '02 handed
ever traditions to those who will be sen
iors for the next year.
The "pilgrimage" commenced at 10 a.
m., after the concert given by a military
band. Under the boughs of the "senior
oak," Charles T. Dozier, president of the
graduating- class, dedicated the oak to
the care of the class of '03. He referred
to the good work achieved during the ex
piring college term and said that the co
operation of the students and faculty had
led to the greatest success. He conclud
ed by asking the class of '03 to be ever
true to the traditions of Berkeley, fos
tered under the "senior oak."
Chester Brown, president of the class of
'03, accepted the "oak" and pledged him
self that those he spoke for would be ever
faithful to the records of their predeces
sors, not only for the balance of their
college days, but also for the years to
follow.
Raymond Carter of the senior class en
tertained the crowd with a speech in
which he "joshed" the professors. He
then said that the graduates would re
member most the deeds of the heart and
not those of the head and bid farewell to
the "senior oak" In feeling words.
The procession of the graduates was
then formed. Ahead marched the mili
tary band, followed by co-eds, the male
graduates bringing up the rear. The first
stop was made at South Hall, where an
address was delivered by Winfield Dorn
He paid a tribute to the faculty and to
the memory of the beloved Professor Jo
eeph LÂ« Conte, whose presence was miss
ed at the exercises. The speaker also re
ferred to the value of college associations
to those about to embark in the duties of
life.
PRESIDENT WHEELER SPEAKS.
INFLUENCE OP THE CO-EDS.
On to the library the procession wended
its way and In front of the building a
vast crowd was gathered. J. M. Eshle
man made a short speech, in which he
dwelt upon the value of the "dig," or
etudy Fide of university life, and that of
co-operation and friendship. He then pre
sented President Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
who was cordially greeted and who spoke'
as follows:
Another year has passed away and again It
It my tura to speak to a graduating class. This
it a good place for you to come and meet me.
The duty of all g.-aduatlng students is to the
library of the university. We ask vour loyal
support for the library, for it is the very stom
ach of the university, and without a proper
library the university cannot exist. The librarv
Is out of all proportion to the needs of the
university. I am glad to say that I am re
ceiving contributions to the library from many
former students. One of them says that he
will increase his donation as his Income in
creases. I hope he will get rich. Here we
must have one of the great libraries of the
Â¦world. There is little that I can say. to you
row. as I will epeak my final words to the
class on commencement day. I thank you all
for your co-operation in carrying on the work
cf the university. I do not believe in fighting
or kickers. Every success in life comes from
r y-mpathy and co-operation and love. Be help
ers of the world to which you are now to enter
la earnest. You have stood loyally by me and
helped me to carry a big- burden. You have
helped me manfully and loyally, and again I
thank you. \ .
. The "pilgrimage" then passed on to the
etepe of North Hall, where M. E. Deutsch
told of the pleasant time spent on the

The street fair whicn\opens at Sacra
mento to-day will attract" large numbers
of people from San Francisco, particular
ly in view of the one-way rate' of $2 50
made by the Southern Pacific for the
rcund trip, tickets being good from to
day up to and including Sunday, May 18,
returning. This is an opportunity to visit
the capital city at little expense and en
joy a pleasant outing. Sacramento is now
en fete, and her citizens are according
hearty welcome to all visitors.
The coal companies in various parts of
the region have already made prepara
tions fcr a siege. Coal train crews, tele
graph operators, switchmen, carpenters,
machinists and other employes, number
ing several thousand, not identified with
the minev/orkers' union have been laid off
until further notice. Some of the compa
nies have also brought their mules to the
surface and placed them in pasture.
President Mitchell spent a busy day at
his headquarters. He was in close com
munication with all the district leaders,
and expresed himself as well satisfied
with the way the men were responding
to the call for suspension of work. He
will leave for Hazleton to-morrow after
noon.
Absolute quiet prevailed everywhere to
day. In pursuance of the district execu
tive boards, which met jointly at Scran
ton last week, all the local unions
throughout the region met during the day
and evening and elected delegates to the
Hazleton convention. It is significant that
in either issue where the vote of a local
became public the ballot showed a de
cided majority for a permanent strike un
less the operators grant concessions. Pre
dictions are made 'that if it is desired on
Wednesday to continue the strike the
struggle will be longer and more bitter
than was that of 1900, which lasted six
weeks.
PHILADELPHIA, May 12.âMinework

regions of Pennsylvania to the number of
140,000 began their struggle to-day for in
creased wages and shorter hours. Never
in the history of hard coal mining has a
tie-up been so complete, not one of the 357
collieries in the territory being in opera
tion. There is every indication for the be
lief that the suspension, which was to
cover only the first three days of this
week, will be made permanent by the
miners' general convention, which will
meet at Hazleton on Wednesday.

Great excitement prevails among the
exiles, who have Just received word that
former President Sam's candidate for
the presidency is General Moot-Plalser.
The moderate and enlightened section of
the Haytian refugees are in favor of the
election of General Firman; the present
Haytian Minister at Paris.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 12.â The
many Haytian exiles are making strenu
ous efforts here to reach Hayti before a
new President has been elected. They had
arranged to charter a steamer and sail
for Port au Prince last Sunday, but the
Haytian consul here refused to grant the
exiles passports, and the steamship agent
at the last 'moment declineM the charter.
The followers of Callistheme Fouchard,
the former Haytian Minister of Finance
and a rival of General Sam in the lat
ter's candidacy for- the presidency of
Hayti, are anxious to return . to Port au
.Prince in order to take a hand in the
struggle which they expect will follow
the election of the new President.
Fouchard is determined to return Imme
diately to Hayti, and it is believed will
endeavor to do so by way of the United
States. .
Boisroud Canal was elected President
of Hayti July 19, 1876. A revolution
against him broke out in 1879, and he re
signed about July 17 of that year. He
was succeeded by General Salmon.
Former President Sam still occupies
the palace, but he will embark this even
ing or to-morrow on board a French
mail boat.
A provisional government iias been es
tablished under the presidency of Bols
roud Canal, a former chief magistrate of
Hayti. He says all the towns of the re
public are in a state of revolution. I
Port au Prince is now quiet, but fur
ther fighting Is expected this evening.
The street fighting, which lasted about
one hour, resulted in a triumph for the
opponents of the government. The troops
at the arsenal surrendered without any
resistance, and the government passed
Into the hands of the revolutionists. Only
two men were killed and three wounded.
The meeting, which opened at noon, had
hardly heard the words of the President
of the House, declaring that a President
of the Republic was to be elected, when
Deputy Jeanott declared that the Con
gress did not have- the confidence of the
people. This was followed by cries of
"Vive la Revolution!" and "Aux Armes!"
and a scene of great disorder followed,
during which Congress was practically
dissolved.
Shooting in the streets began soon af
terward. -
PORT AU PRINCE.. Hay ti f May 12.â At

Minister. of the Interior formally handed
the resignation of President Sam to the
House. A - member of ; the Chamber of
Deputies asked the President of the

"WASHINGTON, May 11.â An Important
contribution to the discussion of the
Philippine government bill was made
in the Senate to-day by Foraker of Ohio.
He maintained that the United States
could not leave the islands until order
had been restored and until a stable gov
ernment had been established. He de
clared that this Government would nor
come away from the islands .under j the
present ot the next administration, even
though the latter be Democratic, because
the American people would never con
sent to poltroonery. Foraker read some
editorials from the , Denver News, of
which Patterson of Colorado is the pro
nrietor The editorials maintained, that
the United States must retain control ot
the Philippines and put down the insur
rection among the Filipinos. With keen
sarcasm the Senator declared that the ed
itorial did â¢ not read as did Patterson's
speeches now. Foraker held that the
policy adopted in the Philippines was
one of the kindest and gentlest possible
and in strict accordance with the instruc
tions of President McKinley. He de
clared- that the minority had attacked
the army from? the commanding general
to the humblest private, all because the
taxmy had resented outrages, without
parallel In cruelty, committed by. the Fil
ipinos. The American army, he said, had
shown a" humanity unsurpassed in- his

The Condor sailed from Esquimau on
December 2d for the South Sea islands via
Honolulu and was never heard of again.
She was given up by the Admiralty and
officially written off the books on Febru
ary 17th, after some life buoys, a boat
and miscellaneous wreckage had been
found on the west coast of Vancouver
Island. It was the theory of many that
she collided with the lost Matteawan, be
lieved to have gone down in the \ same
storm, while others gave it as their opin
ion that she had foundered. The letter
from the sealer shows that the latter
theory was the correct one.
The schooner Mary Taylor is now on
her way to the Bering sea and Copper
Islands on a sealing expedition and will
be back about two months hence. "When
she arrives the scene attendant upon the
foundering of the warship may be told
in full.
It is too bad about the Condor, isn't it?
One of the schooners see her In distress on
the night of December 3. She was firing off
guns and skyrockets and afterward she went
down. It was too rough to gat near her.
The writer refers to the Condor again in
the close of his letter, saying:
I suppose you have heard all about the Con
dor, though, from the papers. â¢
This would indicate that he could give
further details of the disaster. â¢
VICTORIA, B. C, May 12.â The fate of
H. M. S. Condor has at length been defi
nitely learned. She went- down, as many
had believed, in the heavy southeast gale
of December 3d, soon after leaving the
Straits of San Juan de Fuca. The. news
of the foundering of the lost warship is
given in a letter which Robert Marshall,
a boat puller on the sealing schooner
Mary Taylor wrote to his brother, a resi
dent at Metchosin, near this city. The
letter, which is evidently the production
of a none too literate man, does not give
much detail, but this sentence in- which
lie speaks of the Condor shows that she
foundered during that awful night of De
cember 3d, carrying her crew of-Jlft, down
to death near Cape Flattery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The noire, smoke and flames drew a
preat crowd to the scene. Troops of chil
dren ran from their play to the fire. The
yar3s at Sheridan lie in a narrow valley.
On the pouth side of the yard Is a rounded
hill, bare of trees. On the other vide of
the yards a hill fully 200 feet high rises
sheer above the roundhouse. In less than
fifteen minutes both these hills were bfack
with men, women and children, who were
eagerly watching the flames in the cut be
low.
Suddenly a third explosion was heard,
muffled thisÂ»time, as though from a dis
tance, and eventually coming from the
mouth of the valley on the Ohio River.
Between the time when the first tank of
naphtha was damaged in switching and
pprun^r a leak and the moment when It
exploded enough of the liquid had es
caped to work its way into the sewer that
emptied into the Ohio River near the
mouth of Cork Run. Burning . oil, too
found its way into the sewer, and as soon
as it reached the open air at the mouth
an explosion followed. This third explo
sion, {separated as it was by a mile from
the i scene of the burning cars at . Sheri
servert as a warning to the few specta
tor! there. "
Men and women, their clothing ablaze,
their faces scorched and blistered and
their hair burned off their heads, ran
wildly shrieking, hither and thither, 'only
intent on escape from that awfuk furnace
of fire. Some gave vent to frenzied ap
peals to kill them and put them out of
their misery, while little children with
their curlj' locks and light summer cloth-
Ins on fire cried piteously as they were
pwept along. The townspeople did all In
their power for the stricken victims, and
the Pittsbursr ambulances were immedi
ately dispatched to the scene with a corps
of physicians. Many of those not seri
ously burned were removed to their homes
in Sheridan, while others were sent to the
various Pittsburg: hospitals. The dead
were removed to undertaking establish
ments in Sheridan and vicinity and to
the Pittsburgr Morgue.
The .first explosion sent showers of
burning naphtha upon the freight sta
tion, near at hand, and also enveloped a
number of carloads of lumber that were
close by and in a moment all were blaz
ing. Fifteen minutes after the first ex
plosion the two cars of refined petroleum,
that had been damaged by the bursting
of the tank of naphtha and were leaking,
blew up with a terrific report. No one
was injured by this, however.
A torrent of flames belched forth on
cither side of the track, sweeping back
the terrified spectators and sending a
shower of flame over their heads resem
bling Mont Pelee on a Email scale.
The scene that followed was almost be
yond description. The successive explo
sions had heated the air to such an ex
tent that before the third explosion many
were rendered unconscious by the ex
treme heat and the gaseous fumes and
were being carried away when the tor
rent of flame swept over the excited
crowd.
STJFFEKEB3 WELCOME PEATS.
The cause of the catastrophe was the
explosion "of a train of naphtha cars,
which were being switched at the yard.
In the switching the rear car telescoped
a car forward. The leaking naphtha ig
nited from a switch light, causing an ex
plosion which threw the flames fifty feet
high. Much of the escaping naphtha ran
through Corks run to Esplainborough, a
distance of one and a half miles, and
caused another explosion, blowing to
atoms the Seymour Hotel and the Collins
House, on River road, and badly wreck-
Ing a frame building near by, in which
were congregated 200 or more men from
Pittsburg and vicinity, betting on the
races and ball games. Few of the oc
cupants of this building escaped injury,
many being badly hurt. Mrs. Seymour
and her daughter of the Sheridan Hotel
were seriously and, it is feared, fatally
injured.
The first car of naphtha exploded about
4:40 o'clock, and the spectacle soon at
tracted a large crowd on the streets lin
ing the hills parallel to the railroad.
The second car exploded about 5 o'clock,
but it was 6:15 o'clock when three more
cars of the deadly stuff went up with a
roar that could be heard for miles that
the work of destruction really began.

Boys and girls with such a start In life
as they always receive from Paine's Cel-
ery Compound, grow up as sturdy as for-
est oaks; Ihey revel In strength and true
life; they are fair to behold; they make
the men and women most needed by our
country. Do your part this month, dear
parents, with promptness and honesty,
and rest assured Paine's Celery Com-
pound will not fail in its grand work of

When winter grippe has implanted seeds
of virulent diseases, the first and most
important work is to expel from the blood
every trace of poison-. This is always suc-
cessfully accomplished by the use of.
Paine's Celery Compound. /
This marvelous medicine after purifyingr
the foul and stagnant blood, acts as a
nerve food. It builds up the nervous sys-
.tem and nourishes all the bodily tissues.
If your children are not blithesome,
happy, boisterous, and strong in May,
their condition calls for prompt action on
your part. Their futureâ health and phy-
sical happiness or sufferings and ea,rly
deathâ is in your hands, dear parents,
and you alone are responsible to Heaven
and the community of which you form a
part.
fiVK poients, have any of your children
suffered from an attack of the cruel mon-
ster grippe, during the past winter
months? Are your boys and girls irrit-
able, feverish, pale, or weak? Have the;'
cold and clammy limbs? Is the blood
watery. Impure, or sluggish? Is the ap-
petite poor and digestion weak? Has the
rose tint of health faded from the cheek3?
If any of these conditions are noted, be
assured the dregs of deadly grippe are
implanted In the system.
A busy city physician, enjoying a large
annual income, remarked the other day

Of course this is not true.
The quality of "Roxbury" carpets is identi-

same as it was before we cut the price, when
dealers the city over were selling it for $1.10 the

The fight against ; : the law is to be made in ear
nest The lawyers who are handling the case have
These things will raise a laugh, but the laugh from
intelligent men- will not be long. A deliberate wrong
is .to be perpetrated in Alabama under the form ofa
farce, but the wrong is so gross and abominable that
no farcical conception of it will make fair-minded
men pass it over as. a jest.
Questions of that kind were not only intended to
do ji gross wrong,' but to make a jest while doing it.
The aim of the authors can have been nothing else
than that of turning the whole outrage into a kind
of farce and making the law itself as ridiqulous as it
is unjust. It adds to the humor of the situation that
the plaintiff who was . called upon to answer those
questions as an evidence of his understanding of the
duties of citizenship avers in his complaint that he
answered them correctly. It is a pity he did not state
what his answers were. The Monticello Club of this
city is full of bright young men who would like to
know what are the differences between the Jeffer
sonian Democracy and the Calhoun ; principles as
compared with the Monroe doctrine.
One clause of the Alabama suffrage law requires
that the applicant for registration must be able : to
understand the constitution and the duties of citizen
ship. The Registrars have a right to examine every
applicant and to reject those who in their judgment
show a lack of such understanding. The complaint
states a number of questions which the Registrars of
Montgomery County put to intelligent negroes, who
applied for registration. One of these questions was:
"What arc the differences , between the Jeffersonian
Democracy and the Calhoun principles as compared
with the Monroe doctrine?" Another was: "If the
Nicaragua canal is cut, what will be the effect if the
Pacific Ocean is two feet higher than the Atlantic?"
WHEN the telegraphic dispatches brought
information that a suit had been begun in
the courts of Alabama to test the constitu
tionality of the suffrage restrictions imposed in the
new constitution of that State little or nothing was
said of the exact nature of the complaint made by_
the plaintiff, who asked for an order of the court
compelling the Montgomery County Board of Reg
istrars to place his name upon the list of voters.
Since that time the -Atlanta Constitution has been
received containing a detailed report of the com
plaint. It reveals the fact that the Board of Regis
trars in that county at least has been carrying out
the work of suppressing the negro vote with a degree
of humor that would make the fortune of a writer of
the librettos of comic operas.

tion of science to agriculture. The proposed school
will fit young men for that kind of farm work and
will therefore benefit the State as well as the young
men themselves, and add largely to the revenues we
derive from our farms, orchards, vineyards, gardens
and fields.
Father Crowley's project is philanthropic in its
motives, but is eminently practical in its scope and
methods. A tract of land suitable for the purpose
znd of ample dimensions has been bonded at a sum
much lower than a similar tract of land equally well
situated can be obtained in future years. Its imme
diate purchase will therefore be a profitable invest
ment to begin with. When once in operation the
industrious boys under the direction of skillful in
structors and good managers will make the farm very
near self-supporting. The enterprise is therefore
one that appeals to the business sense of the com
munity and merits support on that ground as well as
rpon the claims of benevolence.
There is an urgent need of such a school. The
drift of young men to the cities is one of the great
est evils of modern civilization. It is as bad from
an economical as from a moral point of view, for a
very large proportion of the boys who come to the
city in the hope of bettering their fortunes could
earn more, save more and have more chances to es
tablish themselves in independence by staying in the
country and making themselves masters of some
branch of rural industry.
Although the proposed school is recommended
directly by Archbishop Riordan and the task of
founding it has been undertaken by the Rev.
Father Crowley of the Youths' Directory, it is in no
sense a sectarian movement. When established the
school will make no distinction of race, color or
creed. The prime object will be that of providing
boys with a good moral training, educating them in
rseful work and fitting them to become good citi
zens, prosperous men and successful cultivators of
the soil.
Immediately upon its announcement the appeal
was received with general approval. In this busy
world, however, new things arise every day to crowd
out of mind the things of yesterday, and it is quite
probable a good many people who are willing to
contribute to the fund may have had their attention
turned to other things and are therefore likely to
overlook the proposed school. The projectors of the
enterprise are not advertising it. They are not mak
ing a popular sensation of it. Their work is being
done quietly. It is just as well, therefore, to recall
public attention to it â lest we forget.
SOME days ago there was submitted to the peo
ple of California an appeal for contributions
to aid in the establishment of a school, to train
boys in all forms of rural industry. The appeal was
supported by a circular letter, from Archbishop
Riordan, which set forth the purposes of the school,
tbe methods by which the desired object is to be
attained, and the amount of money required to pur
chase the land and erect and equip the necessary
buildings.
LEST WE FORGET.
The victory is essentially a victory for the repub
lic against all its foes. The Ministry is of a compo
site character and does not stand for any particular
party or programme, of policy except that of main
taining, the existing constitution. It would appear,
therefore, that France has at last attained stable
equilibrium and has nothing to fear from Caesarism,
reaction or radicalism. .'ââ¢:-.'
He accomplished all that without the display of
brilliancy of any kind. It has been a triumph for
plain honesty and sound common sense applied to
the. problems of statecraft. How completely he has
succeeded in eliminating the Dreyfus case from poli
tics is shown by the fact that Drumont, the leader of
the anti-Dreyfus forces, was defeated in Paris, while
Reinach, the Dreyfus champion, was defeated in the
Department of the Basses Alpes. Anti-Semitism was
routed all along the line, and the voters have
shown everywhere an intention to rid their politics
of any and every kind of racial or class antagonism.
By this victory before the people Waldeck-Rous
seau.crowns with triumph the most remarkable suc
cess that has been attained in French politics since
the establishment of the republic. When he entered
office it was said he was. but a makeshift and would
be deposed within six months. He found France
torn with dissension over the Dreyfus case, without
allies, discredited abroad and disordered at home.
By an exercise of tact, patience and diplomacy he
managed to set aside the Dreyfus case, put an end to
the agitation against the army, strengthen himself
in the Chamber, make an avowed ally of Russia and
procure for France a prestige she has not enjoyed
for many a year.
The fact that the Ministerialists were more success
ful in the reballotings than in the first elections is
in itself encouraging, for it shows that the various
elements of the. opposition are not able to combine
and that' a majority of those who oppose the Minis
try on some particular ground make it their second
choice. They will vote for their own particular can
didate on the first ballot, but if he be defeated and
the choice has to be made between a Ministerialist
and some other opponent of the Ministry they will
vote for the existing Government. That feeling puts
an end to any fears 1 concerning the stability of the
Government. So long as the Nationalists, the Im
perialists, the Royalists, the Clericals and the Social
ists will vote for the Government rather than for one
another there is no danger of revolution. The repub
lic is secure. . .
Notwithstanding some disorders here and there,
especially in Paris and Marseilles, the elections are
said to have been the quietest in the recent history
of. France. â¢, The prevalence of good order was in no
sense due to indifference, for no less than 2600 can
didates appeared for the 584 seats in the Chamber,
and the opposition to the Ministry was keen and
vigorous. The lack of serious disturbances may
therefore be taken as a. proof that the French are
learning how to hold elections without undue ex
citement and have acquired sufficient confidence in
their Government to realize it is not likely to be
overthrown however the elections result.
Out of 174 reballotings reports were received on
Monday "from 168. Of those the Ministerialists car
ried 128 and the opposition 40. As the first ballot
ings returned a Ministerial majority, it will be seen
that the Government has an assured control of the
Chamber of Deputies and the Ministry will be able
to go on with its work undisturbed.
REPORTS of the elections in France on Sun
day show that the results of the. reballotings
are even more favorable to the Ministry than
those of the first. Even in Paris, where the first con
tests gave not a single seat to the Ministry, the sec
ond gave them nineteen seats, a gain of three over
the previous â¢ Chamber, and among the. successful
candidates is M. Millerand, the Minister of Com
merce, against whom the opposition exerted all its
forces.
STABILITY IN FRANCE.
In pressing forward the Cuban reciprocity bill and
delaying the isthmian canal bill and the shipping bill
Republican leaders in Congress have blundered, but
fortunately for the party the â¢ Democrats in making
wholesale attacks upon the American army, have
blundered- worse. There are; very few Americans
who are going to vote for Aguinaldo.

A tobacco chewing and : smoking con
test recently took place at the Brooklyn
navy yard in which five officers and half
a dozen sailors participated.' It took sev
eral days. to test the merits of thirty-one
brands of tobacco submitted. , A large
number â¢ of volunteers offered â¢ their ser
vices arid the remarks made by the judges
selected .were carefully chronicled for fu
ture .reference. Twenty-two 'thousand
pounds^ of tobacco, were. to be contracted
for, and has, of course, to be of superior
quality to be i acceptable to Jack. Â»
The -Russian Admiralty is endeavoring
to check the extravagance and corruption
practiced by naval officers afloat and
ashore. An order has been issued for
bidding commanding officers to buy at for
eign ports any articles which are kept In
stock at Vladivostok and Port Arthur,
and purchases of articles not In store will
only be permitted on approval of the ad
miral of the fleet. Instances showing the
necessity for such an. order are given. A
commander last year paid 18 rubles a
pood for oil at Nagasaki at a time when
the volunteer fleet was only paying 4 ru
bles 80 kopeks for the same quality, and
when it could be had at Russian depots
for 1 ruble 60 kopeks to 2 rubles 35 kopeks
per pood. The commanders, likewise, are
in the habit of buying stores in foreign
ports, notably in the Mediterranean, be
fore'leaving for the Far, East at greatly
advanced prices over the stores to, be had
at Kronstadt, and their purchases are
frequently many times greater than their
requirements. This practice is to be
stopped, and the ships leaving for the
Asiatic station are henceforth to take in
a full supply of stores at Kronstadt suffi
cient for the whole .voyage.
The battleship Kaiser Karl der Grosse,
which was placed in commission January
9 last, occupied forty months in its con
struction. . The Kaiser Friedrich III, built
at Wilhelmshafen, was first of that
type of ships, and was forty-three months
under construction; the Kaiser Barba
rossa and the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse,
built by contract, required thirty-three
and thirty-nine months, respectively, and
the Kaiser Wilhelm II, from the Wil
helmshafen yard, took forty-one months
to , cdmplete.
The Frauenlob, a cruiser of the Gazelle
type, was launched March 22 at Bremen.
The vessel is 2600 tons displacement, with
engines . of 8000 horsepower and 20 knots
speed. She is named after one of the first
vessels in the Prussian navy of 1849, and
was presented by the Women's Society to
the Government. The original Frauenlob
was a schooner,- built at a cost of about
$12,000, and was lost with 46 officers and
men in September, 1862.
What little there is left of the Spanish
navy is. evidently not very satisfactory-
Owing to errors in the construction of the
three armored cruisers Cardenal Cisneros,
Princessa de Ashurias and the Cataluna
their bows have to be rebuilt. They were
begun eleven years ago, and it is serious
ly doubted that they will ever be com
pleted.
Two important decrees dealing" with the
organization of the French navy went into
effect April 1. The first decree relates to
the mobile defenses of the ports which are
reorganized, and the list of lieutenants
and sub-lieutenants being Insufficient,
warrant -officers will perform the duties
of commissioned officers in certain cases.
Torpedo â¢ 'boats are henceforth to go In
pairs, each boat being a support to the
other, one to be commanded by a lieuten
ant and the other in charge of a warrant
officer. â¢ The second decree affects the dis
tribution of the forces on foreign sta
tions.
The older school of officers in the Britr
ish navy is almost unanimously of the
contrary opinion to Lord Beresford in his
criticism of the navyÂ» Veterans in the
service, such as Sir Vesey Hamilton, Ad
miral -Penrose Fitzgerald and Admiral
Fremantle, have .come to the conclusion
that nothing is wrong except Lord Beres
ford. I The latter asserted in his speech
of March 14 before the London Chamber
of Commerce that:
Great Britain had no efficient naval ad
ministration, ji . / '. â¢. \ - -Â¦
Second, that the coal supply was most
unsatisfactory. -
Third, that the best admirals "did not
know how to handle a fleet. .
Fourth, â¢ that the shooting of the navy
as a whole { was lamentably defective.
Fifth, that the unbusinesslike adminis
tration of the army applied in part to the
Admiralty.
Sixth, that the training of the fleet was
defective.'
Sir. Vesey Hamilton has been First Sea
Lord of the Admiralty and commander in
chief -of more than one important naval
station, and his views, while. they may be
somewhat j conservative, are sure to re
ceive respectful attention. The two other
admirals are likewise considered able men,
but on the other hand Beresford has the
support of all the younger officers, the
bluejackets and the marines. The Ad
miralty is evidently disturbed at Lord
Beresford's arraignment, and when it was
suggested that he be disciplined, for his
utterances as being in violation of the
navy regulations, the answer was made
that the' Admiralty would pay no atten
tion "to' what a half-pay officer said. As
a member of Parliament Lord Beresford
is sure to give his : views on the navy
question, and the people will be able to
come to some conclusion as to whether
he is right or merely a sensational alarm
ist. Some years ago there were two offi
cers of high rank in our navy of the,
Beresford type, namely Admiral D. D.
Porter and Rear Admiral R. W. Meade,
but they were both effectively disciplined,
the latter being forced to go on the re
tired list. r .
Nearly 30,000 men employed in the dock
yards were discharged on March 31: This
is the usual annual practice in the British
navy, at the close of the financial year.
The men are hired again the following
day, but are given new numbers in the
issue of tickets at the muster stations and
are also distributed into new gangs.
The disastrous gun accident on board
the British battleship Mars resulted in
the deaths of two lieutenants and nine
bluejackets and injury to seven others.
Oft eighteen men who were in the barbette
not one escaped either death or injury.
Two men were blown through a small
opening and only small portions of their
bodies found. Several of the wounded are
in a precarious condition- and two are
hopelessly blind. The accident is believed
to be due to a misfire, the explosion blow
ing the breech block of the 12-inch gun to
the rear, shattering the turret and seri
ously damaging the upper deck and fit
tings.

MARLATT SEEKS DIVORCE
"I'll admit," said the court, "that that
is his salary, but he gets presents, and
I do not think that the "presents* will
cease."
"But, your Honor," said Morris Sam
uels, Rosenfeld's legal adviser, "we have
shown > that my client only gets that
amount as a salary-"
"I'll cut this short." said Judge Hunt.
"You can pay your wife $100 a month, Mr.
Rosenfeld."
Continuing Rosenfeld said he paid sev
eral people, but mentioned neither names
nor amounts.
"I blew it in paying debts."
"Did you not," continued Hanlon, "pre
vail upon your wife to affix the signature
A. W. Jones to a note for $1000, which
>ou indorsed and raised $1200 on?"
"There was such a note," said Rosen
feld. '
"What did you do with the money?"
"Well," said the witness shamefacedly,
"she had chided me about other losses
and I did not want her to know of these."
"Why did you do so?"
"Did you not tell your wife that you
had invested it with Harry Goodall In a
venture that would yield you $40 a
month?" asked Attorney Hanlon. who
represents Mrs. Rosenfeld.
"Yes, sir. I did."
WIFE CHIDED HTM.
Rosenfeld acknowledged having drawn
from the Nevada Bank a deposit of $2001
during the last two months.
."What did you do with the money?"
he was asked.
"I lost it on marginal transactions."
"Any one who can lose that amount in
such a short time can afford to pay $1CO a
month fcr the support of his wife and twe
childien," said Judge Hunt.
Jlax L. Rosenfeld. whose efforts tc
evade the payment of alimony to Agnes
Ttosenfeld during the pendency of a suit
f jr divorce brought by him have brought
hijn' a lot of unenviable notoriety, was
ordered by Judge Hunt yesterday to pay
hl> wife $100 a month until the suit is de
cid*:'!. Rosenfeld and his attorneys plead
ed inability to pay such a sum, but Judge
Hunt was inexorable and directed Rosen
feld to pay the sum ordered from May 1.
Yesterday's inquiry into Rosenfeld's finan
cial condition was the third since the ni
tas of the divorce suit. Young Rosenfeld
was the only one examined and Judge
Hunt made the order after hearing that
he hfid lest ?2S0O in the last two months
dealing in oil and stocks.
Once we had only one dependence and source of
confidence. Now we have many, and while wise mep
will always remember that rainy days will come, all
rejoice in their present capacity to provide an um
brella.
In these conditions no change is visible. The
horizon is void of any sign of surfeit. Profits and
wages are increasing; all consumption is thereby
stimulated, because ill consumption is increased.
â¢ When the Webb stocks went, tumbling and a few
brokers went with them pellmell into the ditch
men calmly turned to the day's trade report to find
an excess of orders for iron, steel and copper, and
such an excess of demand over supply that all con
tracts are underwritten, "To be filled at conveni
ence." In looking at that confidence was made as
strong as the metals which are the first indication
of prosperity and the first of hard times. The mar
ket was still clamoring for them. Its appetite was as
keen as though it had not consumed a pig or ingot,
and on their increasing strength all metal and fabric
production impinged, and men went about their
business undisturbed.
But it will be see.i that whereas credit depended
upon domestic consumption alone, standing only on
one leg, as it were, our trade is now a myriapod,
stoutly standing on many feet, and it will be under
most extraordinary circumstances that all will fail.
If we are to have a loss of confidence again and
a panic it will not be, caused by any accident or er
ror in judgment of the handlers of paper properties.
Its cause will be the ultimate gorging of our con
suming power, and the overtaking of consumption
by production. Against this the country has protec
tion in the wide reach of our/market for consump
tion. Gorging the home demand and making it list
less by indigestion will not of themselves cause a
dangerous panic, because we have access to the
consumption and demand of the world. True, these
may fail also. The power to take our food surplus
and our metal and fabric product may be also im
paired, and production here will then slacken so ap
preciably that loss of confidence and panic may fol
low.
A panic will not originate in Wall street, though
that may indicate its appearance. A thermometer
does not cause the change in temperature which it
registers.
This confidence is .born of knowledge of our
changed financial condition. To-day less of bur se
curities are held abroad in proportion to their, total
volume than at any time in* our history since we
achieved commercial importance. In 1893 such for
eign holdings exceeded two; billions, and when the
first sign of speculative trouble in Wall street was
seen. they began rushing home for liquidation. They
were payable' in gold, and. who has forgotten that
portentous drain of gold which followed? K set in
motion the greenback endless chain, draining the
treasury of its gold, until the Government had to re
sort to the borrowing of $260,000,000 of gold, which
all went into the liquidation of our securities in for
eign hands. Our foreign debt in that form to-day has
fallen far below the billion line/ Every month's trade
reduces it, and if our trade status is not changed the
next fifteen months will wipe it out altogether. Its
present volume is so small that it would hardly be
felt as an addition to any local financial difficulty. It
is as true of nations as of individuals that they know
no hard times when they are out of debt, in that form
which can be forced to immediate liquidation. We
are in that position now, thanks to the gold standard
and the vigor of our foreign trade and the unsatis
fied appetite of our domestic consumption.
THE recent flurry over the Webb stocks, in
Wall street caused some apprehension of a gen
eral panic. - This feeling, of uneasiness sub
sided when it was demonstrated that the trouble
reached only the few firms involved, and that their
fall shook none but themselves. This is the second
time in the last two years that Wall street has been
disturbed without any injurious effect upon the gen
eral credit or confidence. The speculative misfor

It would appear from 'this that a strong array of
facts and reasons are to be given for setting the law
aside as a violation of the rights of citizens guaran-,
teed, by the constitution of the United States. â¢ It
would seem that the manner of. enforcing it is itself
a proof of its invalidity.. A law which can be re
duced to a farce ought not to be valid in any country.
The report goes on to say: "In the shape of ex
hibits a number of speeches are taken from the offi
cial report of the convention and attached as show
ing that the openly avowed purpose of those who
made the constitution was to disfranchise the negro.
President Knox is quoted in this way, and also Judge

That unusual proceeding is explained by the state

to entertain the application on the ground that it has
no original jurisdiction in such matters, and the plan

SPOKANE, May 12.â 1n a room in a
small hotel at Oro Flno, Idaho, a tragic
scene was enacted some time last night.
"When the door of the apartment was
broken in early this morning one of the
occupants, a young woman, was found
cold in death, and the life of her male
companion was fast ebbing away. Both
were fully dressed, and in. the apartment
were evidences that they had spent many
hours of the night in preparing for their
tragic taking-off. On a stand were a num
ber of letters, and the man had left care
ful instructions regarding the disposition
to be made of the bodies of himself and
his companion.
The young woman was Miss Winnie, the
handsome daughter of Rev. G. M. Booth,
pastor of the Methodist Church in Mos
cow. The man, who expired soon 'after
the discovery of the tragedy, was Dr. F.
J. Leadbrooke, one of Moscow's leading
physicians and a man of wealth. They
had taken morphine by hypodermic in
jection. Evidently the physician had first
assisted the girl to end her life and had
then proceeded to encompass his own de
struction.
The prominence of the couple and the
fact that their intimacy was not suspect
ed have caused a profound sensation in
Moscow, where the girl, was reared and
where Dr. Leadbrooke practiced his pro
fession for the past six months. He was
formerly a clergyman, hailing from Min
nesota, and at various times during the
past winter occupied pulpits in Moscow.
He was a widely read man and a psycho
logical student. Dr. ' Leadbrooke had been
an Intimate friend of Rev. Mr. Booth and
his family. Miss Winnie was a handsome
young woman of 19 years and had former
ly attended the University of Idaho at
Moscow.
A few -weeks ago Misa Booth went to
Kendrlck to teach school. Her infatua
tion for Dr. Leadbrooke was not dreamed
of by her parents. On Saturday Dr. Lead
brooke left his home, saying he was
called to Kendrick. There he met Miss
Booth and . together they went to Oro

MORPHINE ENDS
GUILTY ROMANCE
LONDON, May 12.â The Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
has yielded :to the " storm of disapproval
aroused by the feature In the financial
bill affecting checks, and to-day definitely
announced In the House of Commons the
withdrawal of the extra. tax of one penny
placed on checks. He added. that he re
served the right to Impose another tax to
meet the resulting deficiency, j
On the second reading of the finance bill
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Liberal,
moved that "this House declines to im
pose duties on grain, flour and other food
of the people." He urged that the inno
vation contravened the fundamental prin
ciple of sound finance. â¢ Â¦
The Chancellor of the Exchequer in re
piylngr denied that there had been any
general rise in the price of bread. For a
moment the demand was greater than the
supply,. but it must not be forgotten that
while It was necessiiry for Great Britain
to obtain wheat and flour from' America
and other quarters it was equally neces
sary for them to send tl*eir (products to
this country. It was absurd to suppose
that- the 3-penny duty on grain could
cause a single acre to go out of cultiva
tion In America. She must send her
wheat here on account of the protective
duties elsewhere. The production of grain
throughout the world was Increasing at a
greater ratio than the demand. ' He be
lived that the producers and carriers of
grain would pay the new tax if there was
a big crop. It was : necessary to impose
additional taxation on the masses in or
der that they should be made to realize
what war preparation and war involved.

cluded all kinds. Most of It was packed In
mats, jars and cane baskets. S. L. Jones &
Co., who received the cargo, declare that there
was In all of it not a single broken package,
that not an article was in any way damaged
and that when the whole miscellaneous col
lection of Oriental merchandise was delivered
there was not a claim of any kind registered
against the ship.' The cargo included 50,000
mats of rice, and there was not a tear in
one of them. This is an unusual occurrence,
particularly with Oriental freight, and reflects
credit on the officers of the steamship under
whose care It was stowed.

It was announced that Gans weighed in

Gans entered the ring at S>:3o, followed a

The end came -with startling; sudden

when Gans, trying cautiously, caught
Erne napping, and landed a hard right
en the ear, which appeared to jar Frank

home through Erne's guard, drawing
blood from his nose. Then Gans rushed
in. Erne's defense was pitiably weak and
Gans slapped left to the face and right to
the point of the jaw. The blow complete

floor, fell on his back and was rolling
over on his stomach when Referee White

Split hair, harsh hair, lusterless hair,
brittle hair. - falling hair all owe their
origin' to dandruff, which is caused by a
measly little microbe that burrows into
the scalp, throwing up the cuticle into
dandruff scales and sapping the vitality
of the hair at the root, causing the sev-
eral diseased conditions, of the hair till
it finally falls out. J Modern science has
discovered a remedy to destroy the dan-
druff microbe, which is combined in New-
bro's Herpicide and may be had of any
druggist. Allays Itching instantly and

Discouraged. I tried three remedies for female
complaints without relief, and after having
mertyred almost ex-erythlng. reluctlantly sub-
mitted to an operation which seemed to
paralyze me partially, as a result of which I
Â¦was confined to bed for three months. Almost
on the verge of despair I was Induced to try
Kemp's Suppositories. I was naturally skept-
ical about anything helping me, but after the
first month the change in my condition was
marvelous.

This official decision confirms the gen
eral belief that has existed from the first
that the Bastian Hotel was not blown up
by chance or accident, but that the ex

suspect.

burned in .the hotel, are resting easily.

of George Rodgers, who was killed in the
blowing up of the Bastian Hotel by dyna
mite on Friday night. The Coroner and
his Jurors made the closest possible in
vestigation into the explosion and the fire
which followed. The jury set aside all

died bv suffocation in -a fire caused by
dynamite set off by unknown persons
with murderous intent.

Judge Cabaniss rendered his decision
yesterday morning on the motion to dis
miss the case of W. C. Butts, . charged
with an assault upon Thomas Garrett. He
said he had carefully considered the tes
timony offered, but could find no evidence
whatever connecting the defendant with
the assault except the statement by Gar
rett that he was positive he had seen the
face of Butts at or about the time of the
aftault, but he was not prepared to say
as to the Â¦ time and. place. The Judge
therefore considered It his duty to dismiss
the case.
Butts Is Discharged.

The Judge said he would have to dis
miss the case as he had no jurisdiction,
the offense having been committed in Los
Angeles, but he appealed to Larmer to
act the part of a man and fulfill his prom
ise;. It was then that the girl made her
appeal, amid tears and sobs, which was
met with silence, driving her to make the
threat. -v
Larmer, who is a young bricklayer, was
on trial for betrayal under promise of
marriage. The girl testified that while
she was employed in a hotel In Los An
geles she became engaged to Larmer and
ho betrayed her under promise of mar
riage. They both came to this city and
kept company till his .attentions grew
cold and finally he refused to make good
his promise.

The Rev. Henry Imoda died at St. Ig
natius College yesterday in the 71st year
of his age and the fifty-second of his
religious life. Born in Turin, Piedmont,
he went, when still quite young to Naples,
where he afterward began his classical
studies and laid that broad found
ation in classical scholarship which later
distinguished him. He was received into
the society in 1850. On the completion of
his literary studies he was sent to Bene
vento, where he taught the classics for
eome years. The orders of his superiors
next brought him back to Naples, where
he took up his theological studies, and on
their completion was ordained priest. In
1S67 he was ordered to start for California
and thence proceed to the great north
west in order to work among the Indian
tribes. On his arrival in San Francisco,
however, it was decided that California
was to be his field of labor, and he was
sent to fjanta. Clara College to act as
bursar, a position which he held for nine
teen years. In 1S89 he became president
of St. Ignatius College, this city, and on
the conclusion of his term of office was
appointed superior-general of the society
in California. He held this office for five
years, when ill health necessitated his
resignation. He possessed many gifts of
mind and heart, and the present college
library is a monument to his industry and
scholarship.

DIES AT ADVANCED AGE
Judges Gilbert, Ross and Morrow, sit
ting as the United States, Circuit Court of
Appeals, handed down an opinion yester
day that practically ends the litigation
between J. Hanley and Charles
Sweeny, F.' Lewis Clark and the Empire
State Idaho Mining and Developing .Com
pany. The suit involves Hanley's title to
a one- third interest in the Skookum min
ing - claim, - in Idaho, and the opinion of
the' Circuit Court of Appeals sustains
that title and instructs United States Dis
trict. Judge Beatty /of Idaho to issue an
injunction restraining Clark and Sweeny
from taking ore out , of the Skookum
mine, to order an accounting for $150,000
worth of ore taken out of the mine by
Clark and Sweeny and to appoint a re
ceiver. . .
The complainant alleged that Clark and
Sweeny, had represented to him that the
underground workings of the Last Chance
mine in penetrating the Skookum claim
had disclosed ground of little value and
containing.no ore. He Â¦ averred further
that, misled by this fraudulent repre
sentation, he agreed to sell his interest to
Sweeny and Clark for $10,000, and that he
afterward learned that Clark and Sweeny
had taken. ore of the value of $315,000 out
of the Skookum:'. He. therefore asked that
kthe agreement to sell be declared null and
void from its date, and for such further
relief as the circumstances might indi
cate. The case - went up . to the Supreme
Court of. the United /States and Hanley
was declared to be the owner, of one-third
interest in the Skookum and in $150,000
worth of "ore taken out of it after the
date of the, fraudulent agreement of sale.
The concluding paragraph of the opinion
of the Circuit Court of Appeals Is as fol
lows :
We ' are of the opinion that the petitioner
is entitled to have the . niandate-'of this court
in Hanley vs. Sweeny et al. enforced, but In
view of the. statement of the respondent. Judge
Beatty, . that he will proceed to enforce it
upon being advised as to the views ot inls
court upon the questions we have been dis
cussing in this -opinion we will withhold the
writ ' of mandamus until the further action
of the court.
The court handed down opinions in oth
er cases as follows:
Silas F. King vs. J. O. Bender â Montana.
Decree affirmed. Judge Ross dissenting.
The Alaska and Pacific Steamship Company
and the American, Bonding and Trust Com
pany of Baltimore City \vs. C. W. Chamber

The sub-committee of the Republican
Executive Committee, recently, appointed
to frame a call for a State convention,
will meet at the Palace Hotel next Satur
day afternoon.
Nobody blames Governor Gage for "stand
ing by his friends," but he must not blame
the people if they Judse him by the sort of
friends he chooses. If the Governor wants to
be a friend of W. F. Herrin, nobody 'can pre
vent, but neither can they alter or conceal the
fact that W. F. Herrin is the paid political
agent of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and
that the price of his friendship is political ser
vice to that corporation.
It weuld'not be surprising if E. H.
Harriman, president of the Southern Pa
cific, should signify directly to all the
officers, employers and attaches of the
corporation that the company had no
candidate for Governor and no sugges
tions for either convention. Herrin's in
terference in the Senatorial contest and
his open advocacy of D. M. Burns was
said to be excusable in raâ road circles on
the ground that Collis P. Huntington,
then president of the company, desired
Burns' election and so advised the com
pany's - political manager. It is doubtful
if Herrin can justify his Interference in
the present contest on the ground that
President Harriman has a candidate for
Governor whose nomination the company
prefers! The people of both political
parties would be happier and the railroad
people themselves would be better off if
the Southern Pacific Company would keep
out of politics. There is no excuse for
railroad obtrusion in this campaign. The
notion that Herrin is in politics up to his
neck Is not a delusion of the San Fran
cisco press. It is well understood
throughout the State that the attorney of
the company is a political manager. This
sort of comment from the Fresno Repub
lican is significant:
The original plan of campaign in this
State, as outlined by Burns and Herrin,
provided for the nomination of Gage by
the Republican convention and the nomi
nation of a weakling in the Democratic
party to oppose him. It was calculated
that W. F. Herrin would be able to fix
things In the Democratic camp to make
Gage's election easy. Since the first of
May a, change has come over the spirit
of the political push. All signs point to an
awakening in both political parties. It
seems that the voters have resolved to
elect the delegations to nominating con
ventions.

Two-thirds of the estate were distribut
ed last year. The remaining one-third af
fected by the order of yesterday consists
of the following properties:
Bonds of the South Pacific Coast Rail
road, worth $2,750,000; stock in the Pacific
Improvement Company. $750,000; personal
property, 5100,000; cash, $1,000,000, and prop
erty at Eleventh and Mission streets and
elsewhere of sufficient value to bring the
total of the one-third of the estate up to
57,000,000.
Judge Maguire objected to the making
of the order, but he was overruled. He
was given twenty days in which to file
b. bill of exceptions on an appeal to the
Supreme Court. All the other suits pend
ing in Judge Troutt's court in the name
of Mrs, Craven were ordered stricken
from the calendar.
The application for distribution was
made by Charles Wheeler, attorney for
Virginia Fair Vaxiderbllt. C. S. Neal, who
has managed the estate, testified that the
property was in condition to be turned
over to the heirs, Charles Fair, Mrs. Van
derbilt and Mrs. Oelrichs, within twenty
four hours.
An order for the distribution of the es
tate of the late James G. Fair was made
by Judge Troutt yesterday. In making the
order the claims of Mrs. Nettie R. Cra
ven were settled, for it is a formal
declaration that the woman who has
fought for a share of the Fair estate for
more than seven years has no standing as
c claimant of the Fair millions.
Miss I. E. Coles of the South End Pri
mary School and Daniel Whitehead, who
was one of Miss McKinney's pupils in the
John Swett Grammar School, also testi
fied. The trial will be continued next
Monday} morning. ; â¢ ; ,-' :t "
Following Lyser's .witnesses a number
of the principals of the various grammar
schools wherein Miss McKinney had
taught, and who had been called by the
board of its own accord were examined.
Miss K. Conklin, principal of the Star
King School, was the only one. who di
rectly asserted that Miss McKinney did
not do her work in a competent manner.
Mrs. N. A. Wood, principal of the Hearst
Grammar School, Mrs. M. Ifurphyj princi
pal of the Irving M. Scott Grammar
School, and Philip Prior of the -Burnett
Grammar School, but who taught in the
James Lick Grammar School when Miss
McKinney was there, agreed that while
they could find very little or no fault with
Miss McKinney's work in the classroom,
they did not desire to have her as a
teacher under them as she appeared to
be of an unhappy disposition and that she
lacked cordiality.
When the trial was commenced in the
afternoon Lyser called to the stand Mrs.
J. H. Erkson, Miss E. B. Brooks and
Miss M. C. Barry, all of whom were
teachers in the John Swett Grammar
School during the time that Miss McKin
ney was employed there as an instructor.
They were summoned to substantiate the
charges preferred by Lyser and they all
agreed that Miss McKinney was not con
genial, and she did;not affiliate with tne
teachers, but none of them would assert
that she was incapable of performing her
duties as a teacher. Their testimony for
the* most part dealt with matters of triv
ial importance and was not in" the main
unfavorable' to the accused teacher.
"Miss McKinney was suspicious of her
associate teachers, whom she said were
conspiring against her," said Lyser. "She
made complaints against Miss Barry and
Mrs. J. H. Erkson, teachers in the John
Swett School. On investigation I found
the charges to be witnout foundation. Her
conduct was that of a person unfit to
teach, although she was at all times neat
and industrious." â¢
The trial of Miss" Mary McKinney on
charges of incompetency, preferred by
Principal Lyser of the John Swett School,
began yesterday morning before the
Board of Education. Proceedings were
delayed for a time owing to the absence
of Superintendent Webster. When word
was sent to Webster to attend the trial
that official sent word that he must de
cline to take part in the hearing, as his
duty in the case had ended when he made
a report on his preliminary investigation
of the charges.
Lyser was the first witness called' and
was on the stand for two hours during
which he reiterated the c-arges against
Miss McKinney filed in a written com
munication with the board. Lyser dis
claimed that he had declared that Miss
McKinney was mentally incompetent.
Lyser, however, testified that her- mind
was not in a normal condition. He found
her to be nervous and excitable. 'Â¦â¢

police, exactly fit the description of the
men who robbed Newton Blodgett at
Eleventh and Jackson streets and T. Tak

of other recent crimes of similar nature.
The men, who are under closest investi
gation, are James McCoy, arrested with
Belle Hogan in an ark at the foot oC
Alice street, and Walter Baldwin, a dis
honorably discharged United States ma
rine. Baldwin was captured in a Fifth
street house of Ill-repute, the female oc
cupants of which, Clara "Wilson and Min
nie Woods,- were also taken into custody.
The third man is a son of the Hogan
woman. He has not been connected with
the other men, but Is being held on gen
eral principles and because of his asso
ciations. McCoy is said to be* a fugitive
from. a northern city.

tenderloin and on the water front, the
police have in custody three women and
three men, two of the male prisoners be
ing strongly connected with recent hold
ups In this city. The women had been

vitations. He was a sober, steady young man
and I am at a loss to account for his act.
About a week ago he told me that' he had
taken out two life Insurance policies in my
name and I told him that I did not want him
to do anything like. that. I then suspected for
the first time that he- might care for me more
seriously than I thought, but he did not men
tion the subject. For reasons of my own I
then told him that It was engaged to be mar
ried and he replied, "Well, that don't make
any difference. If I die I want you to get
the money anyway."
The last, time I saw him was yesterday after
noon. He was then in excellent spirits and
said nothing to me that would Indicate that
he contemplated taking his own life.
"I knew my daughter was friendly with
Mr. Levy," said Mrs. Miller, "but I am
sure it was not a serious friendship. He
never spoke to her of love and I looked
upon him as simply one of her young gen
tleman friends, as I do upon others who
call here at the house to spend a pleasant
evening. He seemed to be a very good
young man, and I cannot imagine why he
should have taken his own life."
The suicide lived -with his parents at
131S Pierce street, San Francisco. He was
the eldest son and his untimely death was
a great shock to his family. The father
and mother were prostrated with grief.
Deceased was a son of Jacob Levy, a
member of the -firm of A. Levy & Co.,
produce commission merchants, doing
business at 401-405 Davis street. Young

The assertion that the Insurrectionists are

MAN WHO KILLED HIMSELF,
â¢AND GIRLS TO WHOM HE
LEFT LETTERS.
The letter that was written last Is to
the girl in whose name the two insur
ance policies are made out, Miss Amy
Miller, of 110 McAllister street, San Fran
cisco, and reads:
May 10, 10:45 p. m.
Amy: I guess you will be surprised when
you hear of this.
I have reason that no one will ever know
but myself and you.
Now, Amy, be a good girl and tell the folks
to give you. the picture.
Good-by forever. ' SAM.
Find both insurance papers in my pocket.
The second note was addressed to Miss
Violet Armer at Bakersfleld, and was very
short,->as follows:
May 10. 10:30 p. m.
Friend Violet: Will write you a few lines
saying Kood-by forever.
I seen Harry Saturday and he snowed me
ybur letter, bo I (messed we will meet in the

Good-by Vlo. Your friend. SAM.
The insurance policies referred to in the
letter to Miss Amy Miller are for $1000
each, one in the Pacific Mutual Life In- ,
surance Company and the other in the
National Union, a fraternal organization.
Both are made payable to Miss Miller.
There was also a short letter from her
signed simply, "Amy M.," and reading:
Aprfl 26, 1002.
, Dear Friend Sam: Well, I will write' as I
promised to. I looked for the couDon, but
could not find It. I know its around, the house
some place, so will look for it aeaiii. Here
are the pictures I promised to send you. 1

and will give you one if they are good. .
AMY M.
Excuse mistakes and blots, please.
MISS ARMER REPROACHFUL. -
FÂ»om Violet Armer, the other woman
to whom he left a farewell note, there
was quite a long letter dated Bakersfleld.
It consists principally of reproaches for
having cut a picture she sent him in order
to have a photograph button made.
Although the suicide had his insurance
policies made out in favor of Miss â¢ Amy
Miller, there was an envelope in his
pocket containing a lock of hair tied with
a blue ribbon. On the outside of the en
velope was written, "A curl, from Violet
to Sam." â¢ â¢ ,
â¢ There was a letter from 'New York
signed, "Your cousin, Joe Beck," and
another signed, "Your sister, Hulda." . His
pocket memorandum book was filled with
racing notes, addresses .and dates, such
as a commercial traveler would have for
his customers. . â¢ â¢ , Â¦â¢-.
Miss Miller is a rather pretty blonde girl
not yet out of her teens. She Is a gradu
ate of the Girls' High School and lives
with her "parents at their home on Me-'
AlHster street. _ When .seen yesterday she
expressed both" sorrow and surprise over
Levy's foolish act. She stated that she
knew no reason why he should commit
suicide. She said: - . r .
Mr.' Levy was a friend of mine and he never
professed any stronger regard for me than
that of friendship. I have known' him for
about a year and in all that time he never
talked of suicide. I- am quite sure that lie
did not care enough for me to hasten his end
In such a manner. .
/ 'NEVER SPOKE OF LOVE. -
In all the time I have known him he never
once spoke of entertaining a feeling of love
for me. ; He called at the house at times and
invited me to go out. with, him,- but as I am
engaged to be married soon. I declined his in-
REFERS TO POLICIES.
After retiring he evidently devoted him
self to writing two short notes, which
were found on the table in the room.
These notes are dated May 10th, but this
is evidently a mistake, for they were
timed "at 10:30 and 10:45 respectively,
which would be shortly after he secured
his room at the hotel. Both of the let
ters are written on leaves torn from a
memorandum book, and were inclosed in
plain, unsealed envelopes, addressed but
unstamped.
It is evident that Levy committed sui
cide last night, though no one In the
hotel knew' it until an effort was made to
make up the room this afternoon. The
door was found locked, and was forced.
The dead man was on the bed, dressed
in his underclothing, with the revolver
that had caused his death at his side.
Deputy Coroner Henry Quellln says that
death must have been instantaneous. The
surprise is that some one in the hotel did
not head the pistol shot.
Â» Levy went to the Crellin last evening
and asked for a room. He seemed to be
a commercial traveler and he was given
quarters without requiring payment in
advance. He said nothing about the
length of his stay, and retired at once. '
110 McAllister street, San Fran
cisco, and with two letters of farewell to
different women, Samuel S. Levy, of-1328
Pierce street, San Francisco, was found
dead in the Crellin Hotel late this after
noon.

RENO, New, May 12.â Wells, Fargo &
Co. and the railroad officials along the
line of the Southern Pacific through Ne
vada and the western portion of Utah are
excited over the appearance of several
bands of suspicious travelers, supposed to
be train robbers, and have taken precau
tions to guard their property. Detective
John Thacker and a number of other se
cret officers were sent from San Francisco
and are watching each train as it passe3
through the territory in. which the sup
posed bandits have been seen. Bank of
ficials in towns along the line have been
notified and have taken extra precautions
to guard their- gold. .
Several days ago three different parties
of men were noticed in the vicinity of
Beowawa. They were first observed in
the northern portion of the county and
traveled in separate bands, heavily
armed, mounted on exceptionally flna
steeds and led pack horses. Their actions
alarmed the 'railroad men. who notified
the officials in San Francisco. A confer
ence was held by the railroad's agents
and those of the express company. De
tectives were dispatched to Nevada on a
special train and at once placed guards
on every train in transit over the desert
territory. Every car has been provided
with men armed with Winchester rifles,
and detectives have been stationed at
points along the route to watch the move

LADY MEDDLESOME WINS j
SECOND MONEY AT WORTH
Robert Fitzsimmons made his ultima
tum last night. He informed representa
tives of the press between acts at the
Alcazar Theater that he would give
James J. Jeffries two weeks to decide
whether he wanted to battle for heavy
weight supremacy. Lanky Bob. through
the press, invites the clubs of this city
and vicinity to put in bids for the con
test. These bids must be sealed and will
ho. opened at the Central Theater at 3
o'clock on the afternoon of May 26.
"I came 3000 miles to get a fight, and if
Jeffries will not come to terms I will re
turn, and if it is possible will declare my
self champion of the world. 1 want Jef
fries to talk for himself, and I'll do my
own talking. Clark Ball, my manager, is
here, but when it comes to arranging a
championship battle 1 will make the ar
rangements. Then why should Jeffries
leave it to third parties"/ Delaney may be
all right as a trainer, but I won't have
anything to do with him. I want Jeffries
to put up ?23u0 as a guarantee that he will
accept the highest offer. My money is up
and has been up for some time."
The foHowIng telegram was received
liLst night:
LOS ANGELES. May 12.-The champion
ha* changed his mind, and next Saturday
Jeffries will go north and have a talk with
>"iiz. He says he will hunt Fitz up at
ence and talk business with him.
Fitzsimmons will leave for Skaggs
Springs to-morrow morning to make ar
rangements for a place to train for his
coming battle. The Cornishman was out
on the road yesterday doing light work.
He was accompanied by- Nat Goodwin.
The Olympic Athletic Club arranged a
special boxing night for to-morrow In
honor of the members of the Bur

CITY COUNCIL EXONERATES
ACCUSED C0MMISSI0NEP.S
Denounces as Baseless the Charges
Preferred Against ,San Jose
Officials.
SAN JOSE. May 12.â Police Commis
sioner Andrew S. Mackenzie and his col
leagues were to-night found not guilty of
the three -remaining charges of extortion
and blackmail preferred by Kenry E. Mil
ler. On Friday night. Mackenzie was ac
quitted of the charge that he used his
official position to throw city contracts to
a foundry he was alleged to have owned.
The hearing on the third charge, that ths
Commissioners extorted theater passes
from the manager of the Victory Theater,
was set for this evening. The other two
charges were that firemen were assessed
for political purposes and that gamblers
paid protection money to John D. Mac
kenzie with the knowledge of the Com
missioners. As announced In the docu
ment filed Saturday, stating that Attor
neys Hardinge and Firebaugh would
withdraw and alleging partiality on the
part cf the Council, the lawyers did not
appear. Miller also was absent.
Attorney Cothran, representing the com
mission, demanded a hearing. He de
nounced the withdrawal of Miller and his
<cunsel as cowardly, and said he himself
had been attacked because he saw reason
to take the case of the Commissioners.
Commissioners Andrew S. Mackenzie,
Lion, Osterman, Carmichael and Dreisch
ireyer all took the stand and 'pronounced
the charpes absolutely false. The exam
ination of these witnesses occupied but a
few minutes, and they were merely asked
whether the charges were true "or not.
The Council then retired and brought in
a resolution declaring the Commissioners
not guilty. It is stated that no proof had
been offered to sustain any charge made.
Suddenly a puff of wind caught the ship
and whirled it over the Avenue du
Maine. The ship turned completely
around and veered about in a manner
that showed control- of her had been lost.
Then from the center of the .outer en
velope a tongue of flame darted out.
This was followed by a loud report, re
sembling a cannon-shot, and the ship
sank like a stone, falling on the roof of
a house, thence into some trees and
finally reaching the Avenue du Maine,
almost on top -of Its occupants, who had
previously been precipitated to the stone
pavement. The frightfully mangled
corpses of Severo and Sachet were con
veyed to a neighboring police-station.
Practically not a bone of either victim
was left unfractured. Sachet had been
shockingly burned by the explosion.
Santos-Dumont, who has been confined
to his bed for three days suffering from
nervous trouble, said to-day:
"I do not want to talk about Severo.
as I did not see the disaster. I have not
read the accounts in the papers and only
know what my friends have told me.
From what Lachambre, the builder of
Severo's and my balloons, says, I think
Severo lost his head. I understand he
threw out ballast as the airship was ris
ing rapidly. This, if true, is sufficient to
explain the accident. Rapid rising would
drive out the gas through the valve and
send it against the motors, thus causing
an explosion. One defect of Severo's air
ship was that the motors were too near
the balloon.
"No. the catastrophe does not discour
age me, but I fear there will be a set
back to aerial navigation. It will frighten
many persons and discourage those who
wen? Inclined to spend money in such un
dertakings."
PARIS, May 12.â The death of Senhor
Severo, the Brazilian aeronaut, who with
his assistant was killed this morning by
the explosion of his airship La Paix, in
which he was making a trial trip, created
terrible consternation.
1 Senhor Severo had invited many friends
to witness the ascension, and his wife and
a number of relatives were following the
course of the balloon in motor cars. Sud
denly the spectators were horrified by a
bright Hash of light, followed by a loud
explosion. The balloon, which at this
time was 1500 feet above the ground, fell
rapidly, landing on the roof of a house.
The aeronaut fell into the Avenue du
Maine and was dashed to pieces. The
bones of his legs were forced through the
soles of his boots. The engineer who ac
companied him was burned to death.
The accident is said to have been
caused by a leakage of gas.
Senhor Severo started with the intention
of sailing to the military parade grounds
at Issy, and a large number of his rela
tives and friends were proceeding In the
direction of that village, situated five
miles southwest of Paris, and thousands
of others were watching the flight. With
an engineer named Sachet, Severo sailed
out ot his balloon house near the Boule
vard de Vaugirade at 5:30 a. m. In excel
lent spirits and full of confidence, the
aeronaut put his airship through a series
of evolutions before, starting in the direc
tion of Issy. There seemed to be some
hitch with the steering gear, and the rear
propelling screw turned with difficulty.
Nevertheless, after several stoppages, the
airship sailed off. moving steadily enough
through a light breeze.
Deprivation of his sense* of smell
prompted P. J. Keller, known in politics
as the "Mayor of Piedmont," to sue the
Oakland Transit Company for damages,
alleging that that corporation's negligence
was responsible. Keller set a price of $23S
his olfactory nerve, but he did not get
even a part of that sum, for when the
case came up to-day before Judge Hail
the court decided that he was guilty of
contributory, negligence.- -
The accident that put Keller s sense of
smell out of business occurred one night
two years ago, while he was returning
from a political meeting in East. Oak
land. He was thrown off a Transit Com
pany car at Eleventh- and, Harrison
streets and landed on his head on the
pavement. His wounds dressed at
the' Receiving Hospital, Wit when he re
covered he found that he couldn't smell a
thingâ not even the concentrated odors of
Chinatown on a wet night.
Keller tried to have the maltreated
nerve readjusted, and he consulted some
good doctors, but they couldn't make
things odoriferous to him again. So he
began the suit that ended so disastrously.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
' 1118 Broadway, May 12.
The burning of this depot removes the
last trace of this gigantic town scheme
that failed. Had it not been for this
scheme the narrow-gauge road would
have gone through Centerville, one of the
oldest and most thriving settlements in
the lower part of this county, but which
is now handicapped by being two miles off
the railroad.
The big depot building at Newark, on
the narrow-gauge line to San Jose, was
burned this morning at daybreak. There
are no fire-fighting facilities at Newark
and all that the inhabitants of the little
town could do was to prevent surrounding
buildings from being burned.
The fire was discovered by the watch
man, who gave the alarm. The people or
Newark turned out and some came down
from Centerville, among them Supervisor
Homer. Mr. Horner organized a flre
flghting brigade, but having no water, the
burning building was pulled down and
surrounding structures were thus saved.
With the burning of this â¢ depot disap
pears the last mark of the effort that
was made by the late James G-? Fair and
A. E. Davis to make Newark the ter
minus of .their railroad system and a rival
to Oakland. When the narrow-gauge sys
tem was flrst built it was intended that
Newark should be the terminus of the
road. Newark is at the land end of Dum
barton Point, which projects into San
Francisco Bay, â¢ and the narrow-gauge
road originally ran to the end of this
point. There ferry slips were built and
the ferryboat Newark was built to run
from Dumbarton to San Francisco in an
hour. Car shops were built and this big
terminal depot constructed of sufficient
size to accommodate all the* travel that
could arrive, even over an overland line-
Town lots were sold and Newark was to
become a great railroad and manufactur
ing center.
But it was found that the steamboat
Newark, though it was the fastest on the
bay, could not make the trip in the hour,
and so Senator Fair was compelled to
build his road into Oakland and Alanteda
and the big depot at Newark stood there,
almost deserted, covering the tracks that
were once supposed to terminate there,
but had to be laid on to the city that
Newark was to rival.

Scrofula is a disease with numerous and varied |W?Vft<?Mm^O)
symptoms ; enlarged glands or turners about the neck /fftfi^^rtraipy
and armpits, catarrh of the head, weak eyes and dreadful l?p-^Q?/ZÂ£&%Â£,
skin eruptions upon different parts of the body show the ** >VÂ»s>^-^tt'
presence . of tubercular or scrofulous matter in the blood. This dangeroti3
and stealthy disease entrenches itself securely in the system and attacks
the bones and tissues; destroys the red corpuscles of the blood, resulting in
white swelling, a pallid,' waxy appearance of the skin, loss of strength and
a gradual wasting away of the body.
S. S. S. combines both purifying and tonic properties, and is guaran-

a Nuisance.
Jennie Tibbetts, who keeps a lodging
house at 504 Geary street, brought a suit
yesterday against the Clara Barton Hos
pital, which adjoins the lodglhg r house, for
$10,000 damages. She also asks . that tne
tiospital be declared a nuisance.
Mrs. Tibbetts alleges thaj the hospital
exists in violation of a city ordinance, and
is a cause of woe to her because of the odor
Of disinfectants and the cries and moans
of the patients. She alleges that the fre
quent calls made upon the place by un
dertakers, who drive up with dead wag
ons, have driven a number of her lodgers
away, thereby causing her great pe
cuniary loss.
Attorney A. Ruef filed a notice yester
day that an appeal would be taken from
the decision of Judge Sloss in the Justices'
clerk case. He is the legal representative
of Powel Fredrick, who was ordered by
Judge Sloss Saturday to turn over "the
books and papers of the office to George
McComb, who was appointed to the of
fice by the Justices of the Peace.
Ruef contends that an appeal stays all
proceedings, and will, within the next ten
days, file a bill of exceptions to Sloss'
ruling.
McComb's attorneys claim that it is not
an appealable order, arid they are sup
ported In their contention by Judge Sloss,
who, however, has consented to make a
search of the authorities to determine this
new phase of the fight for the office of
Justices' clerk.
In the event that the point raised by
Samuels is found to be correct the order
will be served once. again on Fredrick.
If he refuses to obey; the order then the
execution of the court's dictum will be
placed In the hands of the Sheriff.

Experience has established the ease with
which the great corporations of the State have
at times escaped their Just share of taxes
through the connivance of. friendly boards, ot
equalization. Should this experience be re
peated and this great corporation be able to
avoid Its share of the public burden the weight
of taxation- on 1 the property owners of this
city would necessarily be increased. In any
new franchises are granted pending the de
cision of this matter the risk wlir be incurred
of placing the city street privileges beyond
municipal control, thereby augmenting the
taxes of the people.
The t-an Mateo Railroad has been purchased
by the . United Railroads of San Francisco and
is now part of a system, in fact, as 1 under
stand the question, . the whole system is now
one road. If, therefore, the Supreme Court
should hold that a railroad which operates
in more than one county Is solely within the
jurisdiction of the. State Board of Equalization
in matters of assessment then there will at
once pass from San Francisco the power to
tax this enormous property which has been
developed out of municipal privileges. . '
There is now pending and under submission
in the Supreme .Court .an .action brought to
determine whether the San Mateo electric road
Uhe greater portly of which runs over fran

cation was ordered to be withdrawn.
A communication from Charles Fay,
clerk of the Board of Supervisors, direct
ing attention to the subpena issued by the
Grand Jury on the members to^ attend Its
session to consider municipal affairs
caused a storm of indignation at yester
day's meeting of the board. The board
took the ground that the Grand Jury had
no right to subptna the members.
"One good turn deserves another," said
DAncona, "'and J move that the clerk of
the board be directed to issue a subpena
to the members of the Grand Jury to ap
pear before this Board of Supervisors on
Tuesday at 2:bO p. m."
"If sora^ people desire to put them
selves in a ridiculous position," said
Comte, "I s*-e no reason why we shouid
do so. I meve that the clerk of tho
board be instructed to ask District At
torney Byington under what law he sub
penas the members of this board to ap
pear before the Grand jury. He has no
i lpnt to command us to appear before the
body."
Brandenstein declared that it was an in
dignity on the board and the District At
torney should be rebuked.
Wynn held that the subpena was served
on him as an individual and that he for
one would attend the Grand Jury's ses
sion.

Governor Heard Urges Passage of
Laws to Successfully Oppose.
the Trusts.
BATON KOUGE, La., May 12.â The bi
ennial session of the Louisiana Legisla
ture began at noon to-day. Among the
matters to come before the body are a re
organization of the judiciary, the reap
pcrtlonment of the State for one addi
tional Congressman and legislation affect
ing the insurance situation in Louisiana
and trusts. Governor Heard presented his
biennial message this afternoon. He rec-
ommends .the appropriation of $100,000 for
a - Louisiana exhibit at the St. Louis Ex
position, and purposes the erection there
of a building reproducing the famous old.
Cabildo, facing Jackson square, where the
cession of the vast Louisiana Territory,
to the Government of the United States
v;aa officially consummated in 1303.
On the subject of trusts the Governor
urges that the laws affecting them be re-'
modeled in accordance with the decisions
of the Federal Supreme Court, in order
that the State may be able to success
fully oppose the combinations, which, he
says, have practically assumed power to
impose special taxes upon the great body
of the people.
FRESNO. May 12. â The' newly organized
Fourth Regiment, Uniform Rank, Knights of
Pythias, has been launched, with F. D. Fisher
of this city . as colonel. Lieutenant Harwka of

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
NEW YORK. May 12. â The position of the
local eraser market was undoubtedly the
- source of the depression which ruled in the
track market to-day. This was reinforced by
uie anthracite labor Eituation, as phown by the
suspension of work to-day in the anthracite
region and by fears of a very unfavorable re
port on tiiÂ«- condition of crops on May 1 to 8
made by the Agricultural Department this
afternoon. The statement of the bank* suf
ficiently indicated that some recuperative pro
ws would be used this week. The heavy de
cline of over $C,000.000 in the cash reserves of
the bar.ks had little lifrht thrown upon it to
day, and was a good deal of a puzzle even to
bankers. It was argued that the trust com
panies might be taking Fteps to buiM up their
cash reserve, in accordance with the intimation
from the Cleariryr-hous-e authorities and of cur
rent public discuFf-ion and criticism of the pres
ent financial eituation. The only additional
light on the subject was the report that a
heavy shipment of cash was made to Philadel
phia last week in furtherance of the transfer
of the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf, and which
did not figure in the routine transactions of
the backs. The pressure for funds outside the
stock market was most clearly manifest in the
sterling exchange market, where there was a
violent decline of %c per pound. There were
large offerings cf bankers' bills against further
loans negotiated abroad and London was a free
buyer of stocks during the first nour, thus help-
Ing out the supply of exchange. The statement
of the country's foreign trade for April show
ing- a decline In agricultural products exported
of over $15,000,000 goes to explain the prevail
ing scarcity of exchange' and the persistent
firmness of foreign exchange up to to-day'8
Â¦harp break.
The total pales of etocks for the day,
Â¦which -were not much in excess of half a mil
lion shares, showed that the liquidation was
not lartre or indiscriminate. The stocks which
â¢uffered most seriously also indicate that the
high grade of the property was not an ex
ception. It is recognized that high grade stocks
bave been lifted to prices unwarranted by con
ditions and apparently that the bankers made
a systematic revision and discrimination in
collateral to-day. The consequence was the
melting away of some recently unexplained ad
vance in some of the most substantial etockf
on the list. The coalers had the additional
burden of the etrike to carry. Union Pacific
and Southern Railway were conspicuous for
comparative firmness during the whole day.
Tne market closed etcady at some recovery.
Among the day'* notable declines may be
mentioned General Electric 21. with a recov
rÂ«ry of 18; Westinshouse Electric 11; North
Â¦American C; Lackawanna 13; Chicag-o. St. Paul
illnnearx)lis and Omaha 10%; N. Y., N. H. C.
H. 8; Chicago and Northwestern C%; Delaware
and Hudson 4%; Chicago. Indianapolis and
Louisville 5%; New Jersey Central 4; Long
Island 4%. The lift of declines running 1 to 3
was a long- one. Money went to 10 per cent.
and receded to 1 only after the principal de
mand was BatiFfied.
Bonds were weak in eympathy with stocks.

nificant that the Stock Exchange in view of
the negotiations, will not close as usual on.

American department the New York - bank
statement and the coal strike were disregarded

duller. Canadian Pacifies were buoyant on

The net result will be to increase the profit
margin on -ore mined- to; the, --maximum pos
sible, and to increase tKe quantity that can be
profitably mined, for. the minimum grade that
will pay then will be less than the minimum
that will pay now by the sum 'of the- profits
now earned by, samplings works, railroads, cus
tom smeltlnsf works I and - custom mills. The
common condittona that . affect - the income to
the owners from^ these : > Creek mines
will be made such: that 'the, income will be thj
largest possible instead of being as now the
opposite of this. vC . : . ' .
A common schema. of tunnel opemnKcan be
planned and â¢ built, 'so that gravity drainage
and transportation ; can': be provided at the

capacity doubled as 1 planned, â¢ or trebled if
needed, the .- ore" reduction 0) charges will- be
brought down to flat cost. Including the in
dependent line of ; railroad,'. the ore transporta
tion charge will be made cost or less than
cost. The ton labor cost, of "orÂ« production win
be decreased by/ doing less* dead work. An
additional economy, will be effected by buying
less plant in proportion ,to ore production, by
buying plant and all supplies cheaper, by the
less costly and superior accounting system
that can.be used, by owning and operatiru
common sampling- ,.and concentrating works
and assay plants. â¢'--: *:Â¦ f ; - v .â¢ " " ' Â¦ : â¢

California Ore i Seekers Are

William Beats Jr., mining expert, of Beais &
Whittle of Boston, who examined the Dewey
mine at Thunder Mountain, fays the average
value of the ore is less than $3 per ton at the
mill and there are neither : veins nor lodes on
Thunder Mountain. It is simply a placer de
posit ' influenced - by. geyser aatlon. . There are
two kinds of gold, placer and geyser, the for
mer the more valuable, the latter carrying a,
considerable proportion of silver. â¢ Mr. Baals
states that the Idea of there being $125,000,000
in the Dewey mine or even a small . fraction
of that amount is a gross misrepresentation of
actual facts. "
The Mining and Scientific Press is au
thority for * the s following concerning
Thunder Mountain: .
The Voltaire district seems- to hold the ban
ner at the present time for new finds. At the
Deitrich mine the boys are still taking out ore
and a carload will be shipped to Selby before
the month has passed. - At the False Alarm
claim a new find was made Thursday by Judge
Massey and Professor Roberts. They ran. a
drift from the shaft to the north and' founl
the ledge in place, "ft Â¦ being- two feet -wide.
This was' not expected,' as a . shaft had been
sunk only a few weeks past and the ledge did
not show, it having been missed by only a few
inches.' A contract was- 'let to the Strauta
brothers yesterday to run fifty feet of shaft
on the ledge. Johnny Vieira, who la mining
north of this claim, has also uncovered what
looks - like a good-paying ledge. He is down
twenty feet and f was about . to give up thft
work when a shot broke Into pay ground. His
property, shows a big ledge and should It con
tinue, to Improve he will have a bonanza in a
short time, as his. ledge is the largest on the
hill. Will Fotherglll and Professor Brannon
have also what appears to be a ledge in their
holdings and they will continue to sink on the
property. - This district is exciting considerable
interest. ; . .'
The Carson Appeal says:
NEVADA IS HOPEFUL.
Three claims have been bonded at
Esmeralda, Calaveras County, by. S. W.
Payne of San Francisco.' The Sparrow
hawk and Never Thought quartz mines
at Jeaus Maria have been sold to Hay
wood & Hamilton of San Francisco. The
French - Hill quartz mine at Jesus Maria
has been bonded by F. O. Cortmarsh. â
The : Tuolumne Independent says that
money hae been raised to pay off all the
indebtedness on the Mack quartz mine at
Big Oak Flat and that the company will
be reorganized to work the property.
Stanford &. Estee. are working steadily on
Table Mountain on the Doyle ranch.
: According to the Sonora Union-Demo
crat, the Bourbon mine in the Knights
Creek country has been bonded to H. C.
Dodds of Oakland. The 'Yellow Rock
mine, a recently discovered property, has
been bonded to J. T. Newcomer.
THE MOTHEB ; IiODE. > .
The Amador Ledger reports that a^new
hoist at the east shaft .of Â¦> the? Kennedy
mine and an additional mill are proposed.
The mines are contracting for large quan
tities of round timbers- to 'Â¦ be delivered
from the mountains of Amador ' County
this season. This is due to the advanced
prices of lumber at the yards at tide wa
ter.. The logging' camps of Amador
County will be kept, busy by the mining
demand. A body of - ore has been 'found
on the 800-foot level of the "Bunker Hill
mine that is estimated by the Ledger at
$10 a ton. Twenty additional stamps have
been started at the .Central Eureka mine.
A survey has been 'made at the Sargent
mine at Middle Bar to determine -whether
the lode line runs through the center of
the claim. If the answer is affirmative a
large amount of development work will be
performed. . â¢
The Redding Searchlight says of the
opening of the Niagara mine that work
will be resumed op a very j large scale.
The property has been idle several years,
with the exception of some work done by
leasers, while it was owned by a syndi
cate of Hollanders. V Sinking from the
O'Neil level, the lowest on the property,
will begin soon. ' Â¦'â¢ , Â¦
Two strikes are reported by the Grass
Valley Tidings-Telegraph, in srNevada

King has been vowing vengeance
against Barker ever since Kittle NIhill
and her sister, Annie NIhill, alias Barker,
turned State's evidence and endeavored to
save Barker. Bailiff j Hitfkcy and Police
man Ed wards brought King, Harry Ham
ilton, Barker and the two women from
the prison to the courtroom and Hickey
h.-tJ just placed the three men in the docK
Vvhtn King made a rush at Barker and
struck him. a violent blow on the face,
knopking him' against the wall. King
then sprang upon Barker, and grasping
him by the throat, began to butt his head
against the rwall. Hickey and Edwards
hurried into the dock and had to use
force in dragging King away from Bar
ker. Hickey, getting the skin peeled off tne
back of his hand.-. Annie Barker was
screaming and rushed to the dock, yelling
Ho King to let Barker alone. She at
tempted to enter .the dock, but was pre
vented. King muttered after he had been
dragged away he would like to kill
Barker. The court wss not in session and
the Judge, who was not present, did not
take cognizance, of the assault, as Barker
made no complaint.-- â .'. ..
Later the Judge held the three men to
anther, before the Superior Court on four
charges of burglary for breaking into
the residences of Mrs. Elizabeth Shepherd,
132 McAllister street, on April 21; Mrs."
Kilen Redlngton, 1658 Market street, on
April 22; Mrs. Susie Glascott, 1646 Market
street, on April 23, and Mrs. Anna Mur
ray, 208 Powell street, on April 24. Their
bonds in each case were fixed in 52000
each. In regard to a. charge of burglary
against each of the women," the Judge said
he would give- his decision to-day. Harry
Hamilton will also have his preliminary
hearing' to-day on the charge of robbery
lor stealing a purse" from Mrs. Freeman
ai.d for assault with' a deadly weapon on
Judge Frit^ -
Joseph King, the -convict preacher,
showed^lilmself in his true colors in Judge
Mogan's, court yesterday arternoon when
he made a vicious" attack upon Thomas
L'arker, one of his companions in- crime,
and tried to batter out his brains against
the wall of: the dock. : Kiwr would have
stcceeded in seriously injuring Barker if
it had not been for the -prompt interfer
ence of Bailiff Hickey and Policeman Ed
wards. â¢â¢ . . ; Â¦ '.
The dead man's friends hint at rfflpney
matters as the probable cause leading to
his death. He carried a heavy insurance
on his life. He leaves a wife. 50 years of
age, and a brother, who has charge of
the curtain department at Samuels'.
The funeral will be held Wednesday, un
der the auspices of the Masons, from
B'nai B'rith Hall. The body will be cre
mated at the Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
Poor Mr. Friedlander was a pentlÂ»man and
one of the most honest of men. He could have
had anything from us that lie had a mind to
ask lor. His suicide is unexplainahle. There
vas no reason for hira to have taken his life.
My father will be terribly upset when he hears
ot It. We all thought a great deal of him.
He was renial. and even this morning seemed
to be in the best of spirits. We even spoke
of the future, and I congratulated him on thr.
creat advancement of his department.
LIFE HEAVILY INSURED.
The deceased left his wife at his home,
the Niara. 615 Taylor street, yesterday
morning, apparently in good spirits and
on reaching the store chatted pleasantly
with Louis T. Samuels, the manager. Tige
firm speaks very higlily of its late em
ploye. Louis T. fiamuels said:
In the meantime Miss Daisy Friedlander.
a niece of the deceased, who also works
in the L,ace House, fearing something had
happened, hastened to Mrs. Friedlander'3
home, Â«!15 Taylor street, just as Mrs.
Friedlander received the letter.
Burkett called in a doctor, but all life
had left the body. The Coroner was noti
fied and Deputy J. P. Fennell was sent
on the case.
It is presumed that he went out the
first time to set the rubber tubing, which
he attached to a gasjet and- placed in his
nouth.
When D. S. Burkett, son of the pro
prietor of the Burlington, was passing
along the hall about 2 o'clock In ; the
af teinoon he detected the odor of gas and
traced it to Frledlander's room. He
knocked on the door and received no re
ply, so he went to a ledge outside the
room and entered by the window.
The suicide lay upon the bed fully
dressed, with the bedclothes over him
and one end of the tube in his mouth,
the other end being attached to the gas
tip. the Jet being turned on full force.
Burkett hastened to the. side of the bed
and withdrew the tube from the man's
mouth.
The keyhole in the door was carefully
plugged with a piece of rubber, and all
the windows tightly closed. Upon the
xtble lay the following note:
Burlington, Room 85, 11:30 a. m.,
MayJ.2, 1902.
My Dear Mary: You will "find in my pocket
$24. I bee of you, darling, forgive . me for
â¢what I have done, as I could not do other
wise. Again. 1000 kisses. From your true
boy. - SAM.
Love to all.
LEAVES HOTE TOR WIFE.
The deceased immediately went to the
Burlingrion House and rented a room, and
Â¦went out, returning again in a short
time. He then sat down and wrot3 a
letter to his wife, which he mailed and
Â¦which she received in the 2 o'clock mail.
In it he told her that by the time she
received it he would no longer be in the
land of the living and that she would
find him at the Burlington. He also asked
ber forgiveness. - - Â¦ . : â¢>"
Samuel Friedlander, for twenty years
identified with the D. Samuels Lace
House at Sntter street and Grant ave
nue, committed suicide yesterday by the
inhalation of illuminating gas in a
room* at the Burlington, GUS Market
street. That the suicide was premedi
tated is evident from the manner in
â¢which he prepared to die. .
About 10 o'clock yesterday morning
Friedlander asked Samuels 'for permis
sion to leave the store on business Â¦ (or
half an hour. Samuels told him there
â¢was no occasion for his asking permis
sion, as he could leave at any time.
President E. H. Harriman of the South
ern Pacific entertained Governor Odell of
New York last evening at a 'banquet at
the Pacific-Union Club. Sixty prominent
citizens of the State were invited to meet
Governor Odell and the entire party wai
seated at one table.
The decorations for the banquet were
most elaborate." At the end of the dining
room a scene representing a view of
Southern California was depicted,,, while
in the center "of the room a trunk of a
tree was arranged, with an eagle's ne*tV
built on it. ; JJ
President Harriman. as toastmaster. es
! tablished himself on a more friendly toot
i Ing. He opened the banquet in a short
but clever speech, introducing Governor
Udell to the assembled guests.
Governor Odell illustrated the fact that
he was a good after-dinner speaker. In
his remarks he explained that Siate and
municipal politics must.be run on a bus
iness basis. He illustrated hU remarks*
by showing that the last Legislature of
New York State was- the shortest session
in the last 100 years. He concluded hia
speech by paying a globing tribute to Cal
ifornia nospltanty.
Governor Gage followed with a speeqb
in which he said he felt proud that Gov
ernor Odell had paid a visit to Califor
nia and that he felt sure that great ben
efit to the Pacific Coast would follow
from such a distinguished visit. :-. .
Horace 4Â». Platt responded to the toast
of "'What i Know About Married Wom
en," which was replete with humor. Judge
W. AV. Morrow, Samuel S. Shortridge.
George A. Knight, President David Starr
Jordan of Stanford and President Benja
min. J.. Wheeler of the University of Cal
ifornia - also responded to toasts.
Mayor Schmitz received the heartiest re
ception of any of those who rose to their
feet. to respond to a toast- It was several
minutes before the applause died away.
He said in part: ."V .
In this great empire of the "West wÂ« N *rÂ«
always proud to welcome and to honor the diÂ»
tinguishfd men of our nation.
We are glad to grasp them by the hand and
to say to them,- "ThiÂ» is part of our common
country. This is a land of sunshine and of
joy. i This State belongs to* you as well aa to
us. Stay with us as Ions as you can, and
when yon leave remember that we expeet you
back." , â¢

of the chief executive of the Empire Stated

Mr.- Jones' new bride !s the oldest of the

superb . beauty. She gave her age as 26.
The youngest sister, Margaret Yost, is a
popular and rising young actress, -who
has played several successful engage
ments at the Alcazar. : â¢ ....
When Mr. Jones and his bride-to-be
landed in San Jose on. their wedding day
he "called at the County Clerk's- office and
secured the license to wed. By some
magic charm Mr. Jones succeeded in in
ducing the clerk of the marriage bureau
to neglect to give out the fact that he
had been granted a license to -take unto
himself a bride.- â¢ : " Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦â¢-
Webster Jones is as jovial a chap as
any club man in town who ha3 passed
his forty-year mark. He is a member of
the firm of Jones, Paddock & Co.. the big
coffee and spice people on Fremont street.
This is not his lirst matrimonial venture.
Several years ago he married a Miss
Hobbs, who was one of the most promi
nent society girls in this city. Her father
was a very wealthy man, and, along with
the half million or so that Mr. Jones in
herited at -the death of his. father, the
couple possessed a fortune. that was not
to be sneered at. -But Mr. Jones' matri
monial felicity was short lived. Troubles
came to darken the doors and . soon the
marriage vows were wrecked on the cruel
rocks of divorce. Mrs. Jones entered suit
for divorce in Santa Barbara. Mr. Jones
did not make any contest. Superior Judge
Day of Santa Barbara granted Mrs. Jones
her divorce October 7, 1899. A few months
ago her engagement to'Artsimovitch, the
.then Russian Consul to this city, was
announced. They were married shortly
afterward. "
One day last week Mr. Jones and Miss
Jane ' Stanford ""Yost," "a"." beautiful young
woman, whose father was at one time one
of '"-.e. most prominent^ capitalists of this
cit,'. slipped away from' their numerous
friends and took atrip to San Jose, where
they v/ere secretly wedded by the Rev.

Just -why. 'Air.' Jones .made his prepara

"quiet little affair 'that noboay would

ances in this city. '.<: i â¢ .. . â¢ .
But now that ,the_ secret is. out, club
