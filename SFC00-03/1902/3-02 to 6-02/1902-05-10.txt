ST. THOMAS, D. W.
I., May 9. â An erup
tion of Mont Pelee
volcano destroyed by;
flaming gas and cinders the beau
tiful town of St. Pierre. Mar
tinique, yesterday morning.
From 8 o'clock in the morning
until 1 o'clock in the afternoon
St. Pierre was a mass of fire.
During the intervening hours a
torrent of redhot cinders poured
down upon the commercial cap
ital. The streets were filled with
the destructive outpouring, cut
ting off all avenues of escape. It
is believed that very few of the
twenty-five thousand inhabitants
fjthe^ city could have escaped.
From all intorm^fTorfToTir'oK-**
tained it is estimated that the
number of lives lost" in Mar
tinique Island will reach forty
thousand. A vessel which arrived
at Dominica to-day reports that
she was compelled to run from
St. Vincent because of the vol
canic eruption on that island on
Wednesday afternoon. This ves
sel was off Martinique yesterday
morning about' 8 o'clock' when
the. eruption of Mont Pelee oc
curred. Those on board the ves
sel say there was a tremendous
explosion 01 the mountain, and a
great cloud of fire seemed to
sweep down upon the city and all
the territory around, leaving no
chance for escape for its citizens.

the disaster one must hark back
to the fate of the cities of the

Â¦ All the newspapers here express the ut
most horror at the catastrophe, which,
they ca.y. for its magnitude Ia only com
parable to Pompeii, and they extend deep
sympathy to the French nation.
Owing to the cable breakdown in the
West Indies, no details of the disaster at
Martinique have yet been received here.
The available dispatches from the West
Indies represent the inhabitants of the
other Islands as being In deadly fear.
Professor John Milne, the seismologist,
la an â¢ Interview published in the Daily
Express, declares that his seismic instru
ments nave recorded no disturbance, and
they would almost Invariably have done
bo ! had serious earthquakes occurred.
Professor Milne's theory is that Mont
Pelee "had blown its head off." owing to
the Infiltration of water ; through the
rocks until it had reached the molten
material beneath, forming steam of tre
mendous pressure, when something, had
to give way.
PARIS, May 10.â Although the destruc
tion of St. Pierre. Martinique, was known
here early, yesterday, the Parisians do
not yet seem to realize the awfulness of
the catastrophe, which apparently hardly
caused more than a ripple of excitement
on the boulevards. Even the newsboys
last night were not shouting the last edi
tions of the evening papers with their
visual vim. This was mainly due to the
xneagerness of the dispatches received
here, and to the total absence of details.
The. only sign of grief yet visible is the
half-masted flag over the Ministry of the
Colonies. Beyond reproducing the cable
dispatches received by the Government,

the evening papers yesterday either re
frained from commenting on the disaster
or confined themselves to printing his
tories, ancient and modern, of similar
events. The morning papers to-day do
little better.
The Figaro follows the cable dispatches
with a geographical history of the island
of Martinique and speculates whether the
catastrophe is due to an eruption or an
earthquake or to both, winding up with
the statement that it is not France alone,
but humanity as a whole, that Is plunged
in mourning, as such calamities call up
the feeling of solidarity uniting all who
think and. feel.
The Matin says it Is one of the most
frigrhtful catastrophes recorded, and that
we must go back to Pompeii to find a
parallel for such a calamity.

la Caracas ten thoiisaiid. people were burled In a single
moment, and after this" "event ruin was wrought all along
the line of the Andee by earthquakes. Morne Garon vom
ited vast clouds of dust, vÂ«hich darkened the sun for an
entire day and spread over a hundred miles of. sea and
land. Volumes of mud changed the configuration of the
island and changed its eastern end. The present crater,
formed at that time, is half a mile In diameter and five
hundred feet deep and" ia now a beautiful lake, walled In
by rocky cliffs to a height .of eight hundred feet Its
tJopes are covered with peaceful vegetation and fields of
Within human history there has been but one serious
eruption Jn the Caribbee Islands, but this, like the present
catastrophe, was one of the most destructive the world
has ever seen. In 1S12 the mountain of Morne Garon, on
the Island of St. Vincent, about ninety miles south of
Martinique, exploded. - The explosion was a most fatal
and far-reaching cataclysm, being equaled In recent years
only by that of Krakatoa, in the Btraits of Sunda.
It is true that the soufriere of Guadaloupe has sent up
from its summit from time immemorial faint puffs oÂ£
eteam, and that upon Dominica and other of the islands
there were a few hot -springs, but for nearly a hundred
years there hr.s not been the least sign of an explosion.
There is also an old crater or soufriere on the island of
Et. Lucia which contains some boiling springs.
While explosions by which the mud and cinder type
were ejected have been sudden, they have taken place
only at ions intervals of time, each one adding its pile to
the surface debris and obliterating the previous landscape.
It has been so long since any explosions have occurred
that most geographers as well as inhabitants of the islands
had considered tliat the forces which produced them were
spent, and classified them extinct volcanoes.
The northern islands of the necklace, like Saba and
St. Kustatius, are simple crater cones, but the center of
the chain consists of four larger islands, Guadaloupe,
Dominica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, each of which is a
complicated mass of old volcanic vents whose peaks at
tain their greatest height ia Mount Diablotim of Domin
Â¦ ica. 4747 feet above the sea. These volcanoes do . not. con
form to the type which most people have in mind, for
from them there flow no fiery streams of lava nor do
they always give days of warning before outbreaks. On
the other hand, their eruptions consist of hot water, cin
ders and mud. Their explosions come with terrific sud
denness and when least expected. In volcanoes which
eject lava the ascending column of molten liquid vibrates
the earth for days or even months before it reaches the
surface, and people of the vicinity can always foretell
eruptions. It is not so with the cinder type, for they
explode suddenly and do their damage without much
warning.
Across the throat of the Caribbean extends a chain of
islands (Caribbees) which are really smoldering furnaces
with tires always banked up, always ready to break forth
ct some unexpected and inopportune moment. Tills group,
commencing with Saba. en the north, near our own Porto
Rico, and ending with Grenada on the south, near Trini
dad, consists of ancient ash heaps piled up in times past
by volcanic action. These old ash heaps have weathered
Into fertile soil, which, bathed by an undue share of moist
ure, has become covered with ripe growths of damp and
moldering vegetation. This game soil also produces all
the richest vegetable products of the tropics. These vol
canic islands have been slowly piling up since the begin
ning of the tertiary period, and their bases extend be
neath the waters for a depth as great as their summits
project above it, making their total height nearly ten
thousand feet above their submerged bases.
J^TALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W % ., WASHINGTON, May Robert
\m/ T. Hill to-night gave- The Call^ correspondent a description of the characteristics of the Carib
Â¦bean Sea islands, especially of Martinique, and the cause of seismic disturbance there. .Pro
fessor Hill says that hurricanes, plague, mis government and French-English zvtirs had played fre
quent havoc ivith the inhabitants of crowded St. Pierre. The calamity resulting from the explosion
of Mont Pelee was one of which the people never dreamed. They had looked: upon. : the -mountain's
verdure-clad slopes enly as the home of sprites and goblins and of the dreaded fer de lance, the most
fatal serpent in existence. What happened at Moilt Pelee was a gigantic explosion of steam and gas
accompanied by a thowct of redhot cinders. Professor Hill says:
Â¦ Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦ Â¦ - ' \ . .Â¦ ' â¢ j. Â¦ .
cane. ' The island of Martinique is composed almost en
tirely of old volcanic material, and is dominated by three
conspicuous- peaks which have probably been volcanic in
the past. Mount Pelee, the highest of these. Is 4423 feet
in height and dominates the northern end of the island.
Near the center of the island is Corbet, 3960 feet in 'height,
and near the southwestern end Vauclin, 1657 feet. '
Behind the sheltering lee of Pelee lay St. Pierre. This
city, with its 25,000 inhabitants, isolated from the rest of
the island and the world, except by the call of an occa
sional passing steamer, led a tranquil and quiet existence.
So narrow was the sloping bench upon which it is situ
ated there was hardly room for its population,. crowded in
houses of antique pattern built in old French colonial
days. The streets were paved with cobblestones, and
through each gutter flowed a quiet stream of mountain
water. The inhabitants were almost entirely Martiniques,
that queer race composed of a mixture of African, French
and Carib blood, noted for its, beauty and its misfortunes.
Hurricanes, plague', misgovernment and French-English
wars played frequent havoc with these people, but the
calamity resulting front the explosion of Mont Pelee is one
of which they never dreamed. They, had looked upon its
verdure-clad slopes only as the home of sprites , and Â¦ gob
lins which abound in their peculiar folklore and of the
dreaded fer de lance, the most fatar serpent in existence
and which inhabits only this inland and; St. Lucas.
What happened at Mont Pelee waa. probably this: ; A
gigantic explosion of steam and gas, accompanied ,by a
shower of redhot cinders, which, falling upon" homes arid
shipping, burned and partially buried them. Volcanlsm is
still one of the' most inexplicable and profound problems
which defies the power of geologists to explain, - and one
of the most singular Is the fact that it sometimes breaks
forth simultaneously in ' widely distant portion's of the
earth. A sympathetic relation of this kind has long been
known between Hecla and Vesuvius, .and . it is probable
that the Carib volcanoes have some sympathetic rela
tion with the volcanoes of Central America and Southern
Mexico. At the time of the explosion of St. Vincent other
explosions preceded or followed it in Northern South
America and Central America.
The present outburst" on Mont Pelee in Martinique Is
apparently the culmination of a number of. recent vol-
canic disturbances which have been unusually severe.
Colima, In Mexico, was in eruption but a few months ago,
while Chilpanclngo, the capital of the State of Guerrero,
was nearly destroyed by an earthquake which followed.
Only a few days ago cities of Guatemala were shaken
down by tremendous earthquakes. In a few days, when
the news can be received from the inaccessible interior of
Central America, it will probably be learned that some of
the numerous volcanic summits of - that region have ex
ploded. Although widely^distant; there v stern's J to' be a
geological relation between ' the Caribbean and Central
American volcanic chains. .Â« â¢-'â¢. Â¦Â¦ \ .â¢'. - - ... *Â¦
The whole region of the American Mediterranean, in
stead of being a Tjofly of water, as it appears on the maps,
is looked upon by geologists as a great east and
vest -mountain system', whose/ridgcs, : except the great
Antilles, are submerged beneath the water, where profound
valleys and submerged mountain crests are found between
the banks and depths. This Antillean mountain system
suddenly terminates at each end to the east and west
with lines of great volcanoes running at right angles to
It. These are the volcanic chains of Central America and
of the Carlbbee Islands. It is a singular fact that both
these volcanic chains are of the peculiar type which erupt
cinders and mud, and It certainly appears as if there" was
some sympathetic relation between them.

GREATEST DISASTER OF MODERN TIMES
HISTORY REPEATS
STORY OF POMPEII
No longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces;
safety for themselves was their sole thought. Bach turned
to flyâ each dashing, pressing, crushing against the other.
Trampling . recklesslyV over the fallen, amid groans and
oaths and prayers and sudden shrieks, the enormous
crowd vomited itself forth through the numerous passages.
Whither should they fly? "Some, anticipating a second
earthquake, hastened to "their homes to load themselves
with their more costly goods and escape while it was yet
time; others, dreading the showers of ashes that now fell
fast, torrent upon torrent, over the streets, rushed under
the roofs of the nearest houses or temples or shedsâshel
ter, of any., kindâ for protection from the terrors of the
open air. :^ But' darker and larger and mightier spread the
'cloud ; above them. It was a sudden and more ghastly
: Nigh't rushing upon the realm of Noon!
Â¦-Â¦'..-;;'. *' â¢ ' â¢ Â¦ â¢ ' ;
(\ \* Amid *, the other horrors the mighty mountain now cast
up columns 'of boiling water. Blent and kneaded with the
half-burning;, ashes, the streams fell like seething mud
over the streets in frequent intervals. And full, where the
priests t of Isis had now cowered around the altars, on
which" they had vainly sought to kindle fires and pour
incense, one of the fiercest of those deadly torrents,
mingled with immense fragments of scoria, had poured its
rage. Over the bended forms of the priests it dashed;
that cry had been of deathâ that silence had been of eter
nity!: The ashesâ the pitchy .streamâ sprinkled, the altars,
covered the pavement and half concealed the quivering
corptes of the priests!
-â¢ ; -Â¦..*'. ..â¢-.'Â¦.Â¦Â¦â¢_.â¢ , '
A sudden flash of lightning from the mount showed to
Burbo, who " stood motionless at the threshold, the flying
and laden form of the priest. He took heart, he stepped
forth to join him, when a tremendous shower of ashes fell
right before his feet. The gladiator shrank back once
more. Darkness closed him in. But the shower continued
fastâ fast, its heaps rose high and suffocatingly â deathly
vapors steamed from them, . The wretch gasped for
breathâ he sought in despair again to flyâ the ashes had
blocked up the thresholdâ he shrieked as his feet shrank
from the boiling fluid. How could he escape? He could
not climb to the open space; nay, were he able, he could
not brave its horrors. It were be3t to remain in the. cell,
protected, at least, from the fatal air. He sat down and
clenched his teeth. By degrees the atmosphere from with
outâ stifling and venomotlsâ crept into the chamber. He
could endure It no longer. His eyes, glaring round, rested
on a sacrificial ax which some priest had left in the cham
ber; he seized it. With the desperate strength of his
gigantic arm he attempted to how his way through the
walls.
Meanwhile the streets were already thinned; the crowd
had hastened to disperse itself under shelter; the ashes
began to fill up the lower parts of the town; but there and
there 'you heard the steps of fugitives crunching them
warily or saw. their pale and haggard faces by the blue
glare of th.Â© lightning or the more unsteady glare of
torches by . which they endeavored to steer their steps.
But ever and anon the boiling water or the straggling
ashes, mysterious and gusty winds rising and dying in a
breath, extinguished these wandering lights and with

women;. the men stared at each other, but were dumb. At
that moment they felt the earth shake beneath their feet;
the walls of the* theater trembled: and beyond in the dis
tance they heard the crash of falling roofs; an instant
more and the mountain cloud seemed to roll toward them,
dark and rapid, like a torrent; at the same time it cast
from Its bosom a shower of ashes mixed with vast frag
ments of burning stone! Over the crushing vines, over
the desolate streets, over the amphitheater itself, far and
wide, with many a mighty splash in the agitated sea, fell

There was a dead, heart-sunken silence, through which

Bulwer-Lytton's Description Applies to
Lost St.' Pierre.
THE appalling. disaster at SLPierre, comparable in its immensity of destruction and horror
with the historic tragedy at the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, over which dreaded Vesu
vius poured its death-flood of lava and showered life-destroying ashes upon thousands of in
habitants, vividly recalls Bulw,er-Lytton's rare description of that catastrophe. In the famous novel
ist's word picture, a portion of which is republished here, all the terrible features of a volcanic erup
tion and Us accompanying loss of life and property are presented with an abundance of thrilling
detail. This description may well serve to convey an idea of the horrors at St. Pierre:
The power of the praetor was as a reed beneath the
whirlwind; still, at his word the .guards had drawn them
selves along the lower benches,. on which the upper classes
sat separate from the vulgar. They made but a feeble
barrierâ the waves of the human sea halted for a moment
to, enable Arbaces to count the exact moment of his doom!
In despair, and in a terror which beat down even pride,
he. glanced his eyes over the rolling and rushing crowdâ
whent right above them, through the wide chasm which
had been left in the- velarja, he beheld a strange and awful
apparitionâ he beheldâ and his craft restored* his courage!
He stretched his band. on high; over his lofty brow and
royal , features . there came an expression' of unutterable
solemnity and command. ;
"Behold!" he. shouted with a voice of thunder, which
stilled the. roar of the crowd; "behold how the gods protect
the guiltless! ., The fires of the avenging Orcus burst forth
against the ! false of my accusers!"
. 'The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the
Egyptian and : beheld, witH" ineffable dismay, a vast vapor
shooting from /.the summit of Vesuvius in the form of a
gigantic pine treeâ the trunk, blackness; the branches, fire
r-a- fire that shifted and wavered in Its hues with every
moment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying
red,,.that. again, blazed terrifically forth with intolerable
glare! ' -â¢> â¢" ' .
them the lagt living hope of those who bore them.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
The cloud, which had scattered so deep a murkines3
over the day, had now settled into a solid and impenetra
ble mass. It resembled less even the thickest gloom of
night in the open air than the close and blind darkness of
some narrow room. " But in proportion as the blackness
gathered did the lightnings around Vesuvius Increase \n
their vivid and scorching glare. Nor was their horrible
beauty confined to the usual hues of fire; no rainbow ever
rivaled their varying and prodigal dyes. Now brightly
blue as the most azure depth of a southern sky â now of a
livid and snakelike greep, darting restlessly to and fro as
the folds of an enormous serpentâ now of a lurid and in
tolerable crimson, gushing forth through the columns of
smoke, far and wide, and lighting up the whole city from
arch to archâ then suddenly dying into a sickly paleness,
like the chost of their own life!
In the pauses of the showers you heard the rumbling
of the earth beneath and the groaning waves of the tor
tured sea; or, lower still, and audible but to the watch of
intensest fear, the grinding and hissing murmur of the
escaping gases through the chasms of tha distant moun
tain. Sometimes the cloud appeared to break from its
solid mass, and, by. the lightning, to assume quaint and
vast mimicries of human or of monster shapes, striding
across the gloom, hurtling one upon the other, and van
ishing swiftly into the turbulent abyss of shade; so that,
to the eyes and fancies of the affrighted* wanderers, the
unsubstantial vapors were as the bodily forms of gigantic
foesâ the agents of terror and of death.
The ashes in many places were already knee deep; and
the boiling showers which came from the steaming breath
of the volcano forced their way Into the houses, bearing
with them a strong and suffocating vapor. In some place3
immense fragments of rock, hurled upon the house roofs,
bore down along the streets, masses of confused ruin,
which yet more and more, with every hour, obstructed the
way; and, as the. day advanced,' the. motion of the earth
was mo^e sensibly feltâ the footing seemed to slide and
creepâ nor could chariot or litter be kept steady even on
the most level ground.
Sometimes the huger stones striking against each other
as they fell broke into countless fragments emitting
sparks of fire, which caught whatever was combustible
within their reach; and along the plains beyond the city
the darkness was now terribly relieved, for several houses
and even vineyard's" had been set on flames; and at various
intervals the fires rose sullenly and fiercely against the
solid gloom. To add to this partial relief of the darkness,
the citizens had, here and there, in the more public places,
such as the porticos of temples and the entrances to the
forum, endeavored to place rows of torches, but these
rarely continued long; the showers and tha winds extin
guished them, and the sudden darkness into which their
sudden birth was converted had something in it doubly
terrible and doubly impressing on the importance of
human hopes, the lesson of despair. .*.*â'
â¢Â¦Â¦â¢-.â¢â¢
Bright and gigantic' through the darkness, which
closed around it like the walls of hell, the mountain shone
â a: pile of fire!; Its summit seemed riven In two; or,
rather, above its surface there seemed to rise two monster
shapes, each confronting each, as demons contending for
a world. These were of one deep blood-red hue of fire,
which lighted up the whole atmosphere far and wide; but,
below, the nether part of the mountain was still dark and
shrouded, save in three places, adown which flowed, ser
pentine and irregular, rivers of the molten lava, Darkly
red through the profound gloom of their banks they
flowed slowly on, as toward the devoted city. Over the
broadest there seemed to spring a cragged and stupendous
arch, from which, as from the Jaws of hell, gushed the
sources of the sudden Phlegethon. And through the stilled
air was heard the rattling of the fragments of rock,
hurtling one upon another as they were borne down the
fiery cataractsâ darkening, for one Instant; the spot where
they fell, and suffused the next, In the burnished. hues of
the flood along which they floated!

Instinctively he turned to the mountain, and behold!
one of the two gigantic crests into which the summit had
been divided rocked and wavered to and fro; and then
with a sound, the mightiness of which no language can
describe, it fell from its burning base and rushed, an
avalanche of fire,' down the sides of tha mountain!* At
the same Instant gushed forth a volume of blackest smoke
on, over air, sea and earth.
Anotherâ and anotherâ and another shower of ashes far
more profuse than before scattered fresh desolation alonr
the streets. 1 ..7. '

STREET SCENES IN BAKERS
FIELD, AND ONE OF THE CITY'S
WIDE-AWAKE MEN.
ECRAXTON.-Pa.. May 9.â A general
strike of the miners of the anthracite re
gion has been ordered for Monday next,
but the order has a reserve qualification
attached. The question as to whether the
strike is to be made permanent is left to
the decision of a convention of delegates
of Jl local organizations of mine work
erv. to be held at Hazelton next Wednes
<iay.
The miners' executive committee of
three districts met this evening and had
a three hours' session. At its conclusion
President Mitchell gave out the following
statement:
Replies to our proposition to submit the en
tire Question in dispute to an impartial board
of arbitration have been received from ' Presi
dent Baer of the Philadelphia and Reading.
Chairman Thomas of the Erie Railroad. Presi
dent Truesdale of the Lackawanna. and Presi
dent Ollphant of the Dalaware and Hudson,
all of whom refuse to Join us in the adjust
ment of the differences between us by the
methods we propose. The executive committee*
are now considering the chances of success or
pisribilities of defeat should a strike be in
augurated.
At 4:30 p. m. the committeemen again
assembled and remained in session until
7:30 o'clock. When the session concluded
President Mitchell prepared a statement
and, assembling the newspaper men at
the St. Charles Hotel, read to them as
follows :
ThÂ« Anthracite Mine-Workers of Pennsyl
vania : The executive committees of the an
thracite cine-workers who were delegated by
the Shamokin convention to represent you in
thÂ» negotiations with the railroad presidents
and mine operators for the purpose of obtain
ing increased wages, shorter hours and better
conditions cf employment have exhausted all
peaceable, conciliatory and honorable mean*
at their command and have failed to secure
any concessions of a tangible nature, and while
under the resolutions adopted by the Shamo
kin convention authority was vested In the
executive committees, 6hould they fail In the
negotiations, to inaugurate a strike at what
ever tlmo in their Judgment held out the
greatest premise of success, the committees,
efter three days' serious deliberation, feel
that In Justice to the anthracite mine-workers,
and those dependent upon them, before a gen
eral strike Is Inaugurated the question should
further be considered by a delegate convention,
in which representatives from the various lo
cal unions shall be fully, instructed by their
conrtituents and prepared to vote In favor of
or in opposition to complete cessation of work.
In the meantime all persons employed In or
around thÂ« coileries. stripping*, washeries and
breakers are instructed to temporarily ab
stain from working, beginning Monday. May
12. and continuing thereafter until a final de
clElon is reached by a delegate convention,
which will convene Wednesday morning. May
J4. et Hazelton. Pa. The basis of representa
tion In this convention shall be one vote -for
es.ch 100 members and one vote for each addi
tional 100 members or majority fraction there
of. The executive committees recommend that
special meetings of all local unions be held
on Monday afternoon. May 12, for the purpose
of selecting delegates and considering the
question involved.
While the committee meeting, was on
tills afternoon. President Mitchell was
summoned to answer a long distance tele
phone message. He was gone for half
an hour. Reports had It that he was in
communication with Senator Hanna. He
refused to say whether or not this was
so.
NEW YORK. May 9.â At the office of J.

niece and that her mother was Mrs. Wil
liam Patterson of Pleasanton. Findlayson.

brother. Angus Findlayson. and a sister,
Mrs. Alexander McKinnon. the latter re
siding in St. Louis. Findlayson was a
Scotchman by birth, but spent the early
years of his life in Canada.
"I applied for letters of guardianship be
cause I had reason to believe that . the
property of my old friend Findlayson was
in danger of encroachment by impostors.
Now that he Is dead no. further action will
be taken by me." ~
George Raum, who on Saturday applied
for letters of guardianship Over the person
and property of James Findlayson, said
to-nig-ht:

a....m. as 'the time for -holding* the -. post
mortem examination. The Public Admin
istrator will apply, in the Superior Court
for temporary letters of administration;
BAtUM WILL NOT INTERFERE.
Attorney Barry left the hotel much ex
cited and sought the intervention of Su
perior Judge Angellotti. He was informed
by Judge Angellotti that the latter had
no jurisdiction and Barry returned to the
caravansary. Â¦ -.1 . . j :
During this time Mrs. Patterson had
been notified /by the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company in San Francis
co that, it had been advised of the death of
Findlayson. She was told to come over im
mediately to the company's office, as- the
will other brother. was there. Mrs. Patter
son left on the 3:40, train for. Saa'Fxan
clsco. Attorney- Barry 'and "Countess"
Ingargolio being fellow passengers.'. ..

ed quickly. While he was preparing the
body for removal to the Morgue both the
"Countess" and her attorney made vigor
ous objection to the proceedings. The
"Countess" demanded the keys of the
wardrobe from the maid in attendance,
only to learn that the keys and Findley
son's other effects had already been taken
possession of by the Public Administrator.
Both Miss Ingargollo and her attorney
became much incensed at the quick action
taken and expressed themselves forcibly.
Mrs. Patterson concurred in the desire to
have the body of her brother remain in
his apartments in-. the hotel for the pres
ent, but. to no avail.

gave Sllva $4000, but gave me no reason
for doing so and never said anything
about the electric light plant."
In cross-examination Creed testified:
I have no love for Sllva and I did in con
versation make the assertion that if I was a
younger . man and thought I could get away I
would shoot Silva. I also stated while in con
versation that while acting as Silva' s body
guard if any one shot him I would claim it
was self-defense. >'.-',-

tified to having had a conversation with
Harvey in which the latter said that Sllva
had received from him and other sources
more than $25,000. and that he had him
self paid Silva. since the Legislature met,
more than $7000.

don, "that Joseph Harvey and Adolph
Silva visited the vaults on a certain date
and that a certain transaction was con

Silva was paid by Harvey the sum of
$20,000 oh that day, and further weideslre
to show that Harvey said to Sllva, T[ have

Charles L. Fair was the first- witness
called to-day. After he had testified that
he had known Joseph Harvey for the
past fifteen years and Silva for four or
five years, Attorney Mqldon asked him:
SAN RAFAEL, May 9.â Charles L.
Fafr and Herman Oelrichs were on the
.witness stand to-day during the trial of
the suit brought by Joseph Harvey
against Adolph Sllva for one-half Interest
In the Sausalito electric light plant. They
Â¦were called by the defense, which endea
vored to prove by them that the $4000 paid
by Harvey to Sllva, with which the latter
bought the interest in the electric plant,
was part of the sum due the Sausalito
politician for his services during Mrs.
Craven's contest of the will of tne late
Senator Fair. Some pointed questions
were asked Messrs. Fair and Oelrichs.
but they yielded little material of aid to
the defense, as the gentlemen entered
emphatic denials of every intimation that
they had had aught to dp with Silva at
any time.

A BOSTON LADY

Â¦
A Special Message of Com-
fort for Sick and De-
spondent Women.
Mrs. F. I*. Bernhardt. 382 . Newbury
street. Boston, Mass., found herself In
an extremely perilous condition of health 1
after a surgical operation. Her touching
story, written for the benefit of other
sufferers, Is as follows:'
"It Is with a feeling of extreme grati-
tude and thankfulness and a humane de-
sire to benefit others that I write out my
own experience in the use of Professor
Edward E. Phelps' wonderful preparation,
called Paine's Celery Compound. Owing
to a fall from a horse several years ago
I became a nervous Invalid, and last year ,
I entered a hospital where I was operated
upon by a famous New York surgeon. N
"The surgical operation was successful,
but nervous prostration followed. A sum-
mer in Newport with the best medical at-
tendance failed to restore my nerves to
their normal condition. I was absolutely
unable to digest any solid food, and this
weak condition of my digestive organs,
combined with Insomnia, caused the deep- .
est depression. A constant tenderness and
soreness In the region .of my stomach
with a dull headache and extreme weak-
ness created a feeling of helplessness from
which I was unable to rise.
"It was in* this melancholy frame of
mind that I chanced to meet a Boston
lawyer, who said to me: 'I was in almost
the condition that you are now In, and
after spending hundreds of dollars with-
out receiving any benefit; "I was induced
by a friend to give Paine's Celery Com-
pound a trial, which I did. and it cured
me completely when everything else had
failed.'
"I was rather skeptical about -trying
! a patent medicine, but I ordered a bottle
from my druggist and began to take It
according to directions. Much to my sur-
i prise I slept soundly at. night and did not
awake in the morning with the usual
dull headache. Then, too, I developed an
appetite for solid food, and soon I was
able to digest a course dinner without
any unpleasant sensations. I am now
completely restored to health after about
; two months* use of the Compound..
"Sympathizing with, all who may be suf-
fering as I did. I take this method of
reaching strangers, after /writing personal
letters to my particular friends.. :Â¦;. -.-_.;,-;

WB. HINCHMAN, president of the
Pacific Association of the Ama-
I Â± teur Athletic Union, has re
ceived a letter from Louis H.
Frankenheimer, president of the Stockton
Athletic " Association, stating that the
board of directors met on May 4 and ex
pressed a unanimous desire to send a
four-oared barge crew arid a single sculler
to the annual regatta on Lake Merritt.
A single sculler will certainly be sent by
the Stockton association, but the barge
crew will be required to demonstrate by
their regular training and practice that
they will worthily represent-the slough
oarsmen. â¢ If the crew sticks to its work
and shows it can row it will take part
in the Oakland races.
Two barge crews of the Ariel Rowing
Club will begin to practice as soon as
they can find a place from whieb'to train.
These are the intermediate and the junior
crews. The Intermediate crew consists of
Charles Wilson, bow; E. J. Lynch, No.
2; E. Smith. No. 3 and William Keegan.
stroke. Of the foregoing Keegan was
stroke of the champion junior barge crew
at the Lake Merritt regatta and E. L.
Smith rowed No. 2 in the same boat. E.
J. Lynch and E. Smith are intermediate,
oarsmen. The junior crew ; is made ' up
of E. Bryant, bow; Mat Brady.- No. 2;
William McKee, No. 3, and Henry Luhr
sen, stroke. : ,
The Alameda Boating Club has decided
to hold the opening regatta of the season
on Oakland Creek on May 18. The senior
barge crew will be made up of George
Lewis, bow; W. G. Hanson, No. .2; John
Lewis, No. 3, F. W. Ayers, stroke and
Bert Cameron, cockswain.
It is probable the James Bay Rowing
Club of. Victoria, B. C, will send four
oared shell and barge crews to tne Lake
Merrltt regatta. . The Portland Rowing
Club will also send a four-oared shell
crew, and the men composing it will be
willing to row in a Callfornlan barge as
well. If these northern â¢ visitors and the
Stockton crew come to the regatta, that
event will surpass in interest any rowing
races ever held in the State. .
During the week Theodore Gier, chair
man of the celebration committee of the
Oakland Merchants' Exchange, met rep
resentatives from the various rowing
clubs. One -thousand dollars willbe.set
aside for the regatta, to pay the trans
portation ,and other expenses of the oars
men from* the north and | to prpvide prizes
for the successful contestants. ' /
Several ladles visited the Olympic Club

Paddock, Scott. Horrlgan and James were
also out in skiffs. John T. Barrs will take
the place of Scott in the barge crew, as
the latter cannot train regularly. Prizes
for the members of the winning " barge
crew have been, presented by Charles

fered in 190l,~ and is 'held' by the Sacra
mento Tennis Club, having been won by
Miss Rose Sheehan and Mrs. Moore. The
latter won quite easily last year, but this
year Woodland will send in a team that
Â¦will make the champions j)lay their best
game to retain their honors.
The championship tournament will com
mence on the 14th 'inst. at 9:30 a. m. The
trophies to be contested for- will be as
follows: Charles J. Noack's' loving- cup

and most important tournament ever
held in that part of the State. It is the
third annual tournament, and all the

he claims the stock is deteriorating and,

No datf; has been set by the tourna
ment committee of the San 'Francisco
Golf Club for the handicap match be
tween class A and class B teams. It is
possible the event will be allowed to fall
through. The handicap tournament open
to the members of any golf club on the
Pacific Coast, which was set down for
Thursday, May 1, will probably be
played at a later date. As a public holi
day is the most convenient day for such
an event, May 30 may be selected.
As the number of golfers on the city
links diminishes, that on the links at
Burlingame, Belmont. San Rafael and
other summer resorts increases. The San
Rafael Golf. Club officials have issued a
schedule providing three or more events
for- every month to the end of Septem
ber. The "best ball" competition was
brought to a conclusion last Saturday, E.
J, Hooper winning the men's prize with
a net score of 82 for 18 holes. W.-J. Ca
sey was second with a net score of 83
Mrs. George Heazelton won the ladles'
trophy with a 1 net score of 63 for 9 holes;
Mrs. E. J. Hooper was second with a net
score of 64. No date has yet been set for
the men's stroke competition, open to all
amateur golfers. On Saturday, May 17,
there will be a handicap stroke competi
tion over 18 holes, beginning at 9:30 a. m.
for women and at 1:30 p. m. for men. On

Alfred E. Acklom, secretary of the
movement for providing public links for

tions to tne superintendents of public eolf
courses inN New York. Boston. Chlclgo
and other large cities of the United
States asking for Information with regard
to the cost of laying tfut.a course, of
maintain ng it and providing a clubhouse
Commissioner John . E. Eustls of thÂ» j
borough of Bronx, New York, replies that
the cost of laying out, an eighteen-hole
course was twenty thousand, dollars and
the yearly cost of keeping up the links Â£
about $7250. The numbef of JermUs to
players issued for the present year un tn
April 24 was .1872. the average nurabe? of
players on week days being 250 and on
Sundays and public holidays about 700
The rules were -arranged by the profes
sional golfer in charge of. the course and
there are no fees to be paid by the play

the course in good condition, the city ap

THE terrible Rube has added the
Oaklands to his scalp list. He won
his third straight game since leav
ing the balmy climes- of the south
yesterday afternoon. The Ewlng aggre
gation discovered seven of his elusive
twisters, but he made it all up by bring
ing in two runs with a double-header In
the last spasm of the day.
Cristall was in magnificent form, 'and
he had the Angels thinking about him
throughout the struggle. However, he
threw away his own game by making a
critical error when two had been sent to
the benches in the last and one-all
marked up on the boards.
The game was not fast, yet it was in
teresting. The famous Oakland Inflcl.1
wavered at times and piled up live errors.
Only one of these rigured in the score,
and that was the last disastrous one
which made Morley happy and caused
Lwing's countenance to take on a care
worn expression.
Walters did the only hot-foot to the
plate fcr Ewing in the third. He worked
the eccentric Rube for transportation,
and Mohler sacrificed him. Streib's beau
tiful two-base hit to the flagpole brought
Walters over the rubber. Alter that Oak
land could never score, though they had
men on bases several times.
Hannivan lifted the ball to the house
tops in back cf center in the fifth, and it
be$:an to look like an extra inning affair
until Waddell came along with his timely
Reilly and Anderson drew free checks
in the ninth, but old Peter cleverly caught
the former napping off second base.
Householder had struck out. and with
two gone it looked good for a couple of
additional flourishes. Hanlon- hit an easy
one and both Cristall and Lohman started
after it. Pete interfered and Cristall, lrt
his anxiety, threw over Streib's head.
Waddell drove out a hot two-cushion
wallop to center and both Anderson and
Hanlon were there with runs, i Toman
scored Rube with a single to left field,
and it was all over, including the shout
ing.
Dunlevy was back in the game and
made two singles out of four trips to the
plate. Householder struck out twice and
Waddell fanned three men ' In the last
round. Francks was erratic at short.
Lohman continued his fine throwing to
bases.
Waddell met a serious rival in Cristall,
and the Rube had luck coming his wav.
The ending might have been altogether
different but for the costly error in the
ninth, but It seems as though the husky
southpaw was built to win and not to
lose. The score:

He is married and has two daughters.
May and Christine. Miss Alice â¢ Frey. his
sister-in-law, this, morning received' a let

made of the schooner Anna J. Morse of
Portland, which had just'arrlved,: and on
which he was planning ( to have j his fam

SACRAMENTO, May 9.â The fate of
the spring race meeting to be held under
the auspices of the Capital City Turf
Club at Agricultural Park next week is
in the hands of Mayor Clark.
Twelve or fourteen carloads of horses
have been brought here. It is conceded
that unless pools are allowed to be sold,
the meet will be so unprofitable as not
to Justify the effort.- The license fee of
$500 provided by the original, pool room
ordinance was deemed prohibitive and
the board of trustees at Its last session
reduced the fee to 13, leaving the matter
of granting the license as it was before,
with the Mayor, Chief of Police and pres
ident of the Board, of Trustees, acting as
a commission.
. It was alleged the Mayor would decline
to approve the new ordinance, thus pre
venting pools from being sold next week,
because his political enemy, B. W. Cav
anaugh, was supposed to be In partner
ship with Caesar Young In the pool privi
lege. However, the trouble appears to
have been patched up and the promoters
of the meet to-night declare they have
an assurance that Mayor Clark will sign
the ordinance to-morrow morning and
with the other commissioners grant the
desired license.
James â¢ Martin, the lessee of the race
track, has prepared the bond which is
required preliminary to the granting of
the % license, in expectation of favorable
action by the Mayor.,

Sea waves were created by the explo
sion, which destroyed all the towns and
villages on the shores of Java and Suma
tra bordering the strait, all vessels and
shipping there and 36,380 lives, raised a
tidal wave at Merak 135 feet high, cov
ered 5000 square miles of the ocean with
lava dust several inches thick, submerged
ari island six miles square and 700 feet
high to a depth of 150 fathoms and cre
ated two ' new islands. â¢
Professor Milne was asked: >â¢
"Is it likely that there are volcanoes in
the world at present that have been quiet
for a long time, but will one day or an
other become active?" .:
"It is ' almost certain there are." '
"Some in Europe?" ..
"Many in Europe." .,.
"Some in the United States?"
z "Undoubtedly." .:
Eruptions that build up mountains are
periodical wellings-over of lava and com
paratively harmless, but in the building
up, in which may occur a period of cen
turies, natural volcanic vents are closed
up and gases and blazing fires accumu
late beneath that must eventually find
the air. Sooner or later they must. burst
forth and terrible disasters of the second
class take place. It is the same cause
that makes a boiler burst.
The greatest volcanic explosion ever
known was that of Krakatoa, an island
in the Straits of Sunda, between Jave
and Sumatra, The eruption began on
May 30, 1883. but the great explosion did
not come until August 26. Flames from
the crater could be seen forty miles dis
tant. The crashing explosion which fol
lowed the flames set In motion air waves
that traveled around the earth four timeB
one way and . three . times the other.
Every self-recording barometer in the
world was disturbed seven times by that
blow-up.
These waves travefed at the rate of
700 miles per hour. The noise of this
eruption was heard at Borneo, 1160 miles
distant. It was felt in Burmah, 1478 miles
distant. It was felt In Perth, West Aus
tralia, 1902 miles away. The explosion
was heard over a sound zone covering
one-thirteenth of the earth's surfaced
, \ the eruptions into two gradesâ
those that build up very slowly and those
that destroy most rapidly.
CHICAGO, May 9.â Professor Milne,
the; highest authority In the world
, on volcanic explosions, . classifies
Thomas T. Prentiss was Consul, and
Amedee Testart Vice Consul at St.' Pierre.
Prentiss was born in Michigan and was
appointed Into the consular service from
Massachusetts. Testart was born, and
appointed Vice Consul from Louisiana.
Prentiss is about 60 years of age. He en
tered the consular service in 1871, when
he was appointed Consul at the Sey
chelles IslaBds. He was appointed Con
sul at Mauritius on March 29, 1880," and re
tired In 1894. He was appointed Consul
at Rouen, France, on January. 11, 1900,
and In May of the same year he was
transferred to Batavia, and six months
later was sent to Martinique. Testart
entered the service In 1898.
Naval officers say, however, that as
Martinique is fertile, ther^_will probably
be no need 'for food' supplies, though
money will be useful for the re
erection of homes and the purchase of
clothing for the people. " :Â¦ *V/i'-
The ocean-going tug Potomac, stationed
at San v Juan, will probably be ordered
to-morrow to sail for St. Pierre./ She is
under command of Lieutenant/ McCor
mack. The only other vessels the United
States has in the Caribbean Sea are the
Cincinnati, which is at Santo Domingo;
the Yankton at Cienfuegos, and the Ea
gle and Vixen at Havana. Governor
Hunt of Porto Rico will be ordered to
send relief should it be needed.
"POINTE-A-PITRE, May 9.â To Secre
tary of State, Washington: At 7 a. m., .
on the 8th inst., a storm of steam, mud
and fir.e enveloped the city of St. Pierre
and community. Not more than twenty
persons escaped with their lives. Eight
een vessels were burned and sunk with
all on board, including four American
vessels and a steamer from Quebec,
named Roraima. The United States Con
sul and family are reported among the
victims. A war vessel has come to Gua
daloupe for provisions and will leave at
5 o'clock to-morrow. AYME, Consul."
Appeals were received by the State De
partment from persons living in - New
York, who have relatives and interests In
Martinique, that warships be immediately
dispatched to the Island to render assist
ance. Secretary Moody and Rear Admiral
Taylor considered this morning the ad
visability of ordering a vessel to St.
Pierre, but it was decided not to take
action until the full extent of the disas
ter was known.
Secretary Hay received this afternoon
the following from Consul Ayrne, sta
tioned at Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadaloupe:
with the awf ulness of the catas
trophe that has stricken Martinique.
According to official advices' but
twenty persons out of 23,000 survive from
nature's destruction of the city of St.
Pierre. The administration is" in ignor
ance of the effect of the earthquake upon
other sections of the island, which had a
population of 165,000. Further seismic dis
turbances are apprehended and fears are
entertained that some of the American
possessions, including St. Thomas and St.
Johns, which are practically the property
of the United States, may be affected.

EAST CHESTER HANDICAP
IS CAPTURED BY OHNET
fTp HEATER-GOERS of this city will,
B In all probability, have an opportu
nity of seeing that sterling actor,
Robert Fitzsimmons, tread
stage at the Central Theater before the
close of this month. Negotiations were
practically closed last evening between
this past master of hooks and jabs and
Messrs. Belasco and Thall, and within a
few weeks "Lanky Bob" will be electrify
ing audiences by nis acting in "The Hon
est Blacksmith."
If you leave it to the ex-champion
boxer of the world this play gives him
every chance to display hl3 versatility
as an actor. He plays rour parts during
the production and has won the approval
of the severest critics in the land. As
the honest blacksmith he puts such stars
as James J. Corbett, Terry McGovern and
Jimmy Brltt In eclipse.
The gentleman wno usually plays the
part of the villain at the Central would
Detter go into active training, as "Lanky
Bob" is an enthusiast, and when his lines
call upon him to smite the destroyer of
his happiness he lands no love tap. but
swings as if the object of his righteous
wrath was an opponent in the ring. It
is sometimes necessary for Bob to throw
the same villain through a window, and
he gently lifts the actor and hurls him
through with becoming grace.
During the progress of the play, .Mr.
Fitzslmmons Is called upon to rescue the
leading lady, who Is locked la a room.
Not possessing a key, he loudly exclaims.
"I always carry my key with me." Suit-
Ing the action to the words, he swings
his freckled fist against the door and
shatters it. It may not be generally
known, but it is a fact. Bob is possessed
of a melodious voice. During the play
he gives the audience a sample of hi*
vocal powers, and, according to the self
same Bob, the audience usually yells for
more.
There is a gymnasium scene, and the
challenger of Jeffries gives the spectators
an Idea of what he can do with a punch-
Ing bag. He always ends the scene
by sending the inflated sphere from its
platform with a well-directed smash.
The spectators see a genuine prizefight
with the aid of a picture machine. It is
supposed to be a vision, but they watch
the Australian boxer send Gustavus Ruh
lln into the land of dreams. The play
abounds in startling situations, and Fitz
simmons makes the most of them.
Bob sat in a box at the Central Theater
last evening and was the cynosure ot"
all eyes. Between acts he discussed his
efforts to take on Jeffries. He is out
spoken In his dislike of Billy . Delaney,
and says he want3 to hold a personal In
terview with the champion.

The exposures have been made mainly in New
Jersey and in Pennsylvania. Each of those States has
statutes restricting the employment of children in
factories, but the laws, it seems, are not enforced. It
is stated that in New Jersey the inspectors declare
the manufacturers deceive them as to the age of the
children, and the manufacturers when summoned to
answer declare the parents practice deception upon
the foremen of the factories and get their children
employed by misstating their ages. The excuses are
perhaps the best that can be made, but as the inves
tigation has disclosed that in some of the glass fac
tories, for example, a number of children were found
who are under eight years of age, it would seem that
both the manufacturers and the inspectors were very
willing to, be deceived.'
CHILD LABOR in the Southern States has
rightly occupied a good deal of public atten
tion of late, for it constitutes one of the most
serious industrial evils of that section of the coun
try. It now appears, however, that the attention of
those interested in suppressing that i form of labor
must be turned in other directions as well as toward
the South, for recent disclosures have brought to
light the fact that there is a good deal of child labor
going on in the most progressive States of the East
itself.

An expenditure of- $20,000,000 for the purpose of
making ah experiment that would have been at once
philanthropical and political on so-grand a scale
would have been none too great for a man like Car
negie, and he might have made the investment profit
able. It is not worth while to speculate on what
would have been the result. It is sufficient to take
the. story as an illustration of. what our captains of
industry are thinking of. > Perhaps one day they will
have such propositions promptly accepted by Gov
ernments that wish to get . rid of \ troublesome
problems. In fact, the time may come when a Gov
ernment will advertise for them.
Of course no one caji blame McKinley for re
jecting such a proposition. It was altogether- too
novel and too original for a grave statesman to ac
cept. Still it would have been, a most interesting
experiment had it been undertaken, and would have
been well worth trying. In. these days we have had
a great deal of humorous discussion of the coming
government of the world by business men.. News
papers,' magazines and comic weeklies have treated
the subject in a great variety of ways. It is there
fore interesting to learn that one business man had
a serious idea of trying it.
The writer for the bulletin says: "There is a man
in our nation distinguished for his marvelous suc
cess and for his wonderful use of wealth. Born , in
Scotland, he came to our land poor and has won
distinction" here in many ways. This man went to
Mr. McKinley when the . Spanish treaty was pend
ing and said to him that America was in face of war
in the Philippines; that our people and the Filipinos
would soon be killing one another; and he asked
to be sent to Manila with the fullest authority to
declare that America desired good things for the
little brown men and would soon recognize their
independence. This man said to Mr. McKinley, fur
ther, that he had the matter so much at heart that, if
sent on such a mission, he, would himself pay the
twenty millions of dollars called for by the treaty."
ONE of the most curious stories relating to
our dealings with the Philippines that has
yet been told is contained in the monthly
bulletin for May of the Fidelity and Casualty Com
pany of New York. Published as an editorial, it
comes from a 'reliable source and will excite more
than usual interest because it shows how near the
world came to having an opportunity to see how a
great military and diplomatic pjpblem could be set
tled when dealt with by a business man. on business

If the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific
roads refuse to 'obey the order of the In
terstate Commerce Commission in these
cases the commission will apply to some
Circuit Court of the United States to en
force the order. If the decision of the
lower courts is unfavorable to the rail
road companies they will carry the case
to the Supreme Court of the United
States.
The railroads claimed before the com
mission that control of the routing of
freight by the initial carrier was
necessary to prevent the payment
of unlawful rebates by their connections
in through lines or routes. The fruit
growers contended that the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific roads adopted that pol
icy in order to carry out a pooling agree
ment.
After investigating these complaints the
commission ruled on April 19 that ship
pers were entitled to designate the rail
roads over which their fruit should be
transported. Chairman Knapp dissented
from the opinion of the other members
of the commission and agreed- with the
railroads that they had a right to select
connecting lines to . forward the fruit
shipments to their destination.

It is to be noted that the Gage boss at Humboldt
5 described as having almost disrupted the Republi
an organization in that county and set on foot a
litter factional fight. The Gage tactics, it will be
een, are the same everywhere. The scheme is to
ule the party or ruin it by factions. .The Eureka
evelations afford a timely -lesson for Republicans
hroughout the State. The party must combine'
gainst the bosses and beware of their efforts at fac-
That is the kind qf man who is managing the Gage
ampaign in Humboldt Men of similar character
rre picked up and recruited by the Gage bosses
dierever they can be found. It is upon them" the
Jage conspirators depend to carry through their
cheme to get control of the Republican 'State Con
tention by means of appointed delegates if they can,
.nd, failing that, then by using the "push" at the
â¢rimarics in the hope of capturing delegates in that
ray.
That f=ai<l Sterling Campbell has Improperly inter
neddled with the conduct of primary elections in this
;ounty; that at such primary elections he has put up
lelepates who were pledged to a large extent to do his
lidding; that he uses money, prior to and at such pri
nary elections to succeed in electing the said pledged
iclejrateK; that with such delegates he claims to control
be Republican nomination for nearly every important
ifflce in the county, and even goes so far as to pledge
he county delegation to district or State conventions to
.upport or to reluse to support any candidate for nom
nation that he desires; that for his manipulation of
>rlmaries and conventions he has gained for himself the
lame of "Boss Campbell," and his clique are known as
he "push" from one end of this county to the other
<nd are so gpoken of in San Francisco; that he and his
Â¦Jique have become notorious and extremely offensive
o a large percentage of the voters of this county,
rhich fact has almost disrupted the local Republican
organization here and has set on foot a bitter factional
ight.
Other statements made by such men as Arthur
iV. Hill and Stephen Hill, attorneys at Eureka, and
jy W. N. Speegle, business manager of the Standard,
show Campbell's methods of doing politics and his
â¢eputation in the county. Another gentleman, W.
F. S. Hadley. referee in bankruptcy for Humboldt
bounty and for a long time secretary of the Repub
ican County Committee, sa3's in an affidavit:
Further statements of Senator Selvage show , how
Campbell sought to defeat the reappointment of J.
F. Thompson as t receiver at the Land Office at Eu
reka. In that scheme it is alleged that Campbell
sought to induce Selvage to write to Senator Perkins
md others at Washington indorsing an opponent of
Thompson, one John Bull, and to have said: "Pos
libly it would be a good thing to bring Senator Per
cins to time and give him to understand that he
aouM not get any votes from Humboldt County un
less he took the dictation of Bull and Campbell."
The 'allegations of crooked politics on the part of
Campbell are many and various. Senator Selvage
has reviewed the part Campbell played at a time
when the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Company
sought to obtain permission for extending its lines
in Eureka. In his statement Selvage says Campbell
called at his office and: "He then stated to me that
the City Council could be handled if the telephone
zompany wished to extsnd'its plant and improve its
fj'stem. I asked him how, and he told me that for
i consideration of $1000 each for three Councilmen
md a satisfactory settlement with C. S. Milnes the
matter could be settled."
DISCLOSURES resulting from a controversy
over an alleged conspiracy to stifle bids for
supplying sewer pipe to Eureka have
brought to light facts which are of interest to the
whole State. One of the parties involved in the
worst scandals of the controversy is Sterling A.
Campbell, Collector of the Port. He has been for
some time one of the foremost of the minor bosses
of the Gage camp and it is upon him that Gage re
lies to obtain a subservient delegation from Hum
boldt County to the Republican State Convention.
It is for that reason the whole State has an interest
in the Eurek^i disclosures. They furnish to the pub
lic a reveiauon of the local repute of a typical Gage
boss. /

The circumstances of Smith's attack, at
the culmination of the struggle to give
Statehood to Arizona, New Mexico and
Oklahoma, attracted uryisual attention to
the case. For several days he had been
among the foremost in the debate, and
at the moment of the attack he was com
bating an amendment to the bill. It was
believed by the doctors that the Intensity
of his efforts had brought on the attack.
He suffered a slight secondary attack
about half an hour after the flrst one,
but it was less serious. The doctors re
mained in almost continuous consultation,
being fearful that apoplexy might result.
WASHINGTON. May 9.â Delegate Mar
cus A. Smith of Arizona was taken ill on
the floor of the House to-day at the close
of a brief but vehement speech on the
Statehood bill, in which he is deeply in
terested. Three members of the House,
who are physicians â Gilson, Showalter
and Ballâ attended him and for a time
they feared that serious results might fol
low. Smith' was conscious, but an ex
amination by the physicians indicated
that he had been threatened with an
apoplectic attack. He was made as com
fortable as possible in the rooms of the
House Committee on Pensions.

If it be desired to perpetuate as an American State
the high-sounding name of Montezuma the best way
to do it would be to give that name to New Mexico.
The creation of a State bearing the name of Jeffer
son would receive general approval. That much has
be^n made evident by comments of the; press in all
sections of the Union. It seems no[more than' fair
that out of the immense territory his prompt state
craft, added to the republic one State should be
named for him. Possibly Oklahoma migKt take the
name. The chances are, however,- that neither
project will carry. Jefferson and Montezuma must
be content to live in the memory of men and in the
names of counties and towns. There is to be no
State honor for them. -
The union of Oklahoma with Indian Territory is
still more objectionable by reason of the wide di
vergence between the two populations and their
civilizations.' As has been pointed out in Congress,
Indian Territory is without school lands or public
highways to' any considerable extent, and. if the Ter
ritory were annexed the people of Oklahoma would
have to. divide their school fund and bear a heavy
burden in bringing the Territory up to the standard
of Oklahoma life.
It is not likely that either amendment will be ac
cepted. Arizona and New Mexico have been so long
organized as Territories- with their present boun
daries that the majority of the people resident in
them have developed a local patriotism arid a senti
ment averse either to union with one another or to
a change of name. Besides the conjunction of the
two would make too large a State for convenience
of administration with the present scant means of
traveling over wide districts of country in â¢each of
them. Even in California the vast size of the area
included in the commonwealth tends to develop local
prejudices and leads to log-rolling jobs in the Legis
lature between northern and southern interests.
AS was. expected, the omnibus bill providing for
the admission of Arizona, New Mexico and
Oklahoma has brought out a great deal of
opposition from the extreme Eastern men. So far
as that opposition is direct it has been discounted in
advance and hardly needs further comment. There
have been offered to the bill, however, two amend
ments that are at least interesting. One proposes to
combine Arizona and New Mexico to form a State
of Montezuma, and the other to unite Oklahoma
and Indian Territory to form a State of Jefferson.
JEFFERSON AND MONTEZUMA.
When Mrs. Jack Gardner built her Venetian "pal
ace" in their city the Bostonians looked upon it as
a freak, but the Boston Herald says that since.it has
"settled into being" it makes the colonial mansions
in the neighborhood look like thirty cents; and it is
beginning to be believed that Mrs. Gardner is a
reformer in architecture and the Boston of the future
may be the Venice of America.
The passage of the bill by the House
involves a double defeat for the House
leaders. Not only did they propose the
secret bringing up of the measure, but
it became known to-day that they held
a conference among themselves and de
cided to amend the bill by admitting
Oklahoma and the Indian Territory as one
State and Arizona and New Mexico as
another. It was found that Chairman
Knox of the Committee on Territories was
not a party to this conference and both
of these propositions were overwhelmingly
defeated, one yesterday and the other
to-day. The bill passed the House to
day without division.
There is a great fear, however, that
the increase in population contains ele
ments of Democracy, and unless the Re
publican majority is large enough to be
absolutely safe the Territories will . not
be admitted by the Senate. The people
of the Territories are very anxious for
Statehood " and if voting the Republican
ticket will bring them their wish they
will probably do as told next fall.
, But there is another story to the legis
lation. The Republicans of the Senate
will quietly allow the bill to sleep in
committee at the other end of the Cap
itol until after next fall's Congressional
elections. Then if the three Territories,
In their election of delegates, show indi
cations of remaining good and strong Re
publicans the Senate -will, take up the
bill and pass it.

As the aqueduct bridge was crossed the
guns of the President's yacht Sylph
boomed out' a funeral salute of minute
guns. The burial ceremonies were sim
ple, being confined to a prayer for the
dead, the reading of a psalm and music.
At their conclusion the saluting battery
of the Fourth Artillerv stationed outside
the gates boomed out three salutes. This
salute was in lieu of the usual volleys of
musketry. -'â¢*..
As the casket, which was closely cov
ered with the blue field of the American
flag and banked with roses, was lowered
upon the bier from the shoulders of the
bluejackets the male quartet sang "Lead,
Kindly Light." Meanwhile the mourners,
the family of the deceased, save Mrs.
Sampson, who was too ill to attend, were
seated. Then followed the service, very
simple; in fact, little more than the fune
ral ritual of the Presbyterian church. As
the benediction was delivered the body
bearers took up their burden, and, fol
lowed by the family of the deceased, the
President and his Cabinet, diplomatic
body and many notable personages, the
remains were carried out of the church
and placed in a hearse. Soon the long
funeral procession was on its way to
Arlington. The President did not go to
the cemetery.
The remains, borne on the shoulders of
eight sailors from the United States
ship Dolphin, were placed in the waiting
hearse and escorted to the church.- As
many people as the large edifice possibly
could seat were assembled in the' body
of the church. The first pew to the right
of the central aisle was occupied by the
President and his family. General Miles
sat behind the diplomatic body. To the
left of the main aisle the first pew was
assigned to the mourners, the members
of the Sampson family and their close3t
friends. The Supreme Court sat next,
and behind them the select committees
from the Senate and the House of Repre
sentatives and then many individual Sen
ators* and Representatives.
Â¦ The funeral escort was composed of the
light battery of United States artillery,
commanded by Captain Foote and drawn
from Fort Myer; the naval cadets from
Annapolis, 247 strong, a corps that never
paraded In Washington before, save on
several occasions when a President was
inaugurated, and a battalion of blue
jackets from the North Atlantic squadron.
Rear, Admiral Terry, commanding the
escort, with his staff, assembled at the
church. The cadets swung into line and,
headed by the Naval Academy band,
marched from the church to the residence
of the dead admiral on New Hampshire
avenue, about half a mile away. Here
the honorary pallbearers were gathered,
headed by Admiral Dewey.
Every department of the National Gov
ernment was represented* .The j military
and naval features of the ceremonies were
brilliant and impressive. They were con
ducted under direction, of Rear Admiral
Terry, commandant- of the Washington
Navy Yard.
WASHINGTON, May 9.â With a pomp
and circumstance exceeding that of any
naval funeral in this country, in recent
years at least, the remains of William T.
Sampson, rear admiral in the United
States navy 'and commander in ..chief of
the United States naval forces on the
North Atlantic station during the war
with Spain-, were to-day laid at rest.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. May 9.âAt

will to-day file his petition before the
Supreme Court for ouster proceedings
against the Beef Trust, which he believes
is operating in Missouri. He believes the
testimony at the hearing before the- Su

the packing companies severely* for vio

be able to destroy the combine.
Letters that have gone out from the
commission men to the shippers advising
them not to send cattle to the market
during the present agitation have had ef
fect, retailers say, and meat that now is
being sold to them i3 cold storage stock
of dubious quality. From several reliable
retail dealers it was learned that em
balmed meats and poultry are being sold
in Chicago. Artificially preserved beef
and fowl are not eaten by the poorer
classes, but by the wealthy patrons of
restaurants and high-class hotels. The
process is so perfect that no taint is left
on the meat and It looks as fresh as new
cuts. An immense saving in the use of
refrigerating cars is effected by simply
immersing the flesh and shipping it in
barrels. One of the reasons given for the
embalming process is the alleged agree
ment to purchase and kill stock outside
of Chicago during the present agitation
against the so-called trust.
"There were a few changes in words,"
said Bethea, "but they vrere of a trend
to strengthen in a legal sense the charges
which we framed. There is an impres
sion that Attorney General Knox sought
to soften the charges. The exact re
verse is true. We hope to-morrow to
let the public know the full details of our
investigation and the facts upon which
the Government will base Us suit.- The
case is strong." ... - â¢ '.

Bethea said that Attorney General Knox

in the bill as it was prepared in Chicago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The. Eastern press should immediately Teform in
this respect. California is part of the Union. Our
product has competed with the Black Sea country
in controlling the weld's wheat market. Our gold
alone enabled the financing of the war for the
Union and the resumption of specie payments. Our
copper carries the electric spark that lights the nar
row streets of Eastern cities. Our lumber is the
hope of the East for shade from the torrid summer
and shelter from the Arctic winter. Our fruit is the
health-giving luxury of Eastern tables. Our wine
maketh glad the heart of man in that section, and
our wool protects him from "blasts baith snell and
keen." Our climate is the Tesort of the anaemic and
neurasthenic Eastern people, who have been warped
in bending to the extremes of weather, and our
scenery on canvas is the brightest ornament of
Eastern homes. Therefore why not cease this pro
vincial ignoring of our gifts and graces, our charms
and blandishments, snd say truthfully that we are
the handsomest sister in the family, as good as she
is beautiful?
Californians are the greatest travelers in the
Union. They are everywhere East, not to improve
their health but to impair it, that they may taste the
pleasures of contrast when they come home. They
are not of the tourist class, nor are they idlers. They
go on business, bear their exile with what patience
they may and gladly face westward and come home.
But they have interests here. They want to see
whether rain, is falling on the fields and orchards,
and whether the .vineyards are purpling in the 'sun.
They dwn argosies at sea and they want to know
what signals are flying from San Diego to Cape
Mendocino. They want to feel the balm of the home
air and scent the sweetness 'df'^he} blessed % flowers,
and so they look at the morning weather report to
find that it is snowing at Davenport and people are
frozen near the stove in Eastport! If an Eastern
man sojourn in California his comfort is increased
and his great contentment enhanced by reading in
The Call the day's temperature in Boston, New
York, Washington and Chicago. If it be in winter
he goes to his window and looks out upon a serene
sky to which the flowers look up in a sisterhood of
beauty. If it be in summer he reads of the scorch
ing heat in the East, thinks of hectic childhood swel
tering in the cities, puts on his light overcoat and
goes to the [ Cliff House to breathe the cool sea
breeze and wonders how any one can live anywhere
than here.
In no other respect is this Eastern provincialism
more apparent than in the daily weather reports.
These as a rule stop at the Missouri River, and if
they, extend to Salt Lake and El Paso it is either
by oversight, a special act of grace, or because of
some eccentricity in the weather' there that may
make an unfavorable impression by being taken as
a constant condition. But the weather from Podunk
to Sioux City is elaborately bulletined every day, as
if the space between spanned the Union and left no
information untold.
The "California fruit store," which hangs its ban
ner out in every Eastern city and hamlet, is our only
missionary in those parts, and we owe the Eastern
metropolitan press but little for any exertion exposr
itory of our virtues.
These things being so, one is astonished at .the
provincialism of the Eastern press, which avoids
anything bearing upon the fixed ' and . immovable
qualities of California, which make this the Prom
ised Land. The chosen people had to cross the Red
Sea and traverse the wilderness to find Palestine.
That land of milk and honey, full of corn and wine,
could not go to Egypt. The exodus had to carry
the immigrants to Eshcol and Shiloh, and when pro
vincial Pharaoh chased them he got drowned for
his pains and became what Mr. Mantilini called "a
demned moist, uncomfortable body."
At the same time what we have in superiority to
all the world is non-exportable. Our sun shines
only here, and our soil is fixed as the hills. Our
matchless scenery will abide until the heavens are
rolled up like a scroll, and our seedtime and har
vest will come and cur season of bloom and fruit
will be, in defiance of all adoption and fearless of any
imitation.
BECAUSE Califorhians are a bit bumptious
about their big and great State ; they are
called "provincial." This taunt, however, is
drawn out by our local loyalty, and has no. reason
founded in our ignorance of the rest of the Union.
To see our own superlative quality we do not have
to shut our eyes to everything else. We have al
ways known of the transferable artificial advantages
of the East, and have adopted such of them, and as
fast, as would serve our purpose and improve our
condition. It is the peculiar misfortune of the East
that the advantages of California are inherent; they
are natural and fixed, and therefore cannot be trans
ferred. To enjoy them people must come here.
Witness the difference! If the East develop any
thing desirable in manufactures or commercial
methods we invade no copyright and infringe no
patent by importing it for our own use.

It is always difficult to enforce laws of this kind.
Where the workers are not strong enough to fight
their own battles and protect their own rights it is
difficult to get justice done. ,, Just for .that reason,
however, the laws that are made for the protection of
the weak should be most carefully enforced by those
in authority. Now that the officials of New Jersey

will set an - example for all other States by bring

to them the full penalty of the violated law.

SAN JOSE, May 9.â The Investigation of
the charges of ' extortion and blackmail
against Police Commissioner Andrew S.
Mackenzie and his colleagues before the
Council this evening was not without
comedy features^ After three and a half
hours' deliberation the accused was found
not guilty of the fourth charge. This was
the one wherein Henry E. Miller accused
Mackenzie of using his official position to
take city work and contracts to a foun
dry which he was alleged to have owned.
The chamber was crowded . and many
were unable to gain admittance. It waa
a Mackenzie crowd, and it applauded
every move in favor of the Commission
er. The Council decided to pass the first
three chargesâ these alleging the assess
ing of firemen for political purposes,
which Implicated John D. Mackenzie, the
collecting of "protection" money from
gamblers and the extortion of theater
passesâ and take up the last one. At t the
opening of the meeting a communication
was read from forty-eight members of
the Fire Department, declaring they had
rever paid any money to the Chief of the
department or others for political or other
purposes under threats of expulsion.
Miller and his counsel were caught nap
ning and had no prepared testimony bear
ing upon the first charge taken up. The
method of procedure was objected to by
Attorney Flrebaugh, and several sharp
altercations occurred between him and
Attorney Cothran. Attorney Firebaugh
then sought to introduce evidence by
calling William F. Tennant, a fireman. It
was only through Tennant's quick an
swers that anything was elicited. He
said he had paid a political assessment,
but he got no further, as his testimony
was obiected to.
. After much wrangling Firebaugh called
Andrew S. Mackenzie. - Attorney Cothran
refused to allow, his client to take the
stand for the prosecution, and City At
torney Patridge decided that Mackenzie
could not be compelled to testify. Miller's
attorneys then offered to waive the
charge that Mackenzie had thrown city
work to his alleged foundry and proceed
with the others, but the Council refused
to accede to this. â¢
Attorney Cothran produced a court reo
iord showing that, although Mackenzie
had inherited the foundry from his
mother's estate, he had transferred it to
his sister. This went on
The Council took a short recess, after
which it brought in a verdict finding An
drew S. Mackenzie not guilty' of the
charpe, and that he did not own the
foundry.
-. An adjournment was taken until Mon
day night, when the Council-will take up
the charge of extorting theater passe3
from C P. Hal!.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
All of the men involved In the, tragedy
came to the mine but recently. Tavano
arrived in March from San Francisco.
He la about 30 years of age. Englehardt
was unarmed when he was attacked.
Tavano's caseknlfe was found on his
bed, but the miner's candlestick with
which the murder had been committed
had disappeared. Tavano took his pis
tol with him and has fled to the moun
tains. Bloodhounds will be put on his
trail. :
When the news of the murder was re
ceived Deputy Sheriff Walters was not
long in capturing Perferino and Fran
chinetti. He then started In pursuit of
Tavano. /?
NAP A, May 9.â Oathill mine, twelve
miles from Calistoga, was the scene of
a brutal murder last night. Charles En
glehardt, a German, was stabbed through
the heart with a miner's candlestick by
a fellow laborer. Deputy Sheriff John
Walters, foreman at the mine, brought
the news to Napa this morning at 7
o'clock, having come from. Calistoga tb
notify Sheriff Dunlap of the tragedy. Joe
Perferino and A. Franchinetti are under
arrest at v the mine. Antonio Tavano, a
third suspect, made his escape and up
to this morning the officers here had
not been notified by Sheriff Dunlap of
his capture. Englehardt was attacked
by all three and it is not known which
man did the killing, though suspicion
points to Tavano.
Tavano went to Englehardt's bunkhouse
last night with Franchinetti and Per
ferino and attacked Englehardt. A few
minutes later the fighters adjourned to
the outside. There Englehardt was
knocked down and his three assailants
began pounding him. It was during this
scrimmage that one of the three mÂ»n
stabbed the prostrate man.
During the quarrel in the bunkhouse
Tavano had drawn a caseknlfe and was
about to plunge it into Englehardt's back,
when he was persuaded not to do so by
Perferino. The latter, in his cell to-night,
claimed he also acted as peacemaker on
the outside.

Dandruff Is Caused by a Germ That
Saps the Hair's Vitality.
It is now a settled fact that dandruff is
caused by a germ. Falling hair and bald-
ness are the result of dandruff. Dr. E. J.
Beardsley of Champaign, 111., got hold of
the new hair preparation, Newbro's Herp-
icide â the only one tha% kills the dandruff
germ. He says: "I used Herpiclde for my
dandruff and falling hair, and I am well
satisfied with the result.". Dr. J. T. Fu-
gate of Urbana, 111., sayB: "I have used
Herpiclde for dandruff with excellent re-
sults. I shall prescribe It in my practice."
Herpiclde kills the dandruff germ. Physi-

giving gossip about a dozen or more California
literary people who have settled in Gotham.
The Btorjr this week is " A Story of Some

Looker-On department has a story of the late
Admiral Sampson, besides other timely matter
"Over the Long Distance" is a bright and
jingly bit of verse. W. O. McGeehan has a
very original sketch, and "Rubbertasie" is an
amusing description of a new disease peculiar
to San Franciscans. Betsy Bird's gossip is full
of good things, and "Campaign Echoes" is
a correct summing up of the political situation
The paper Is full of miscellaneous brilliancy"

Gage has a few more crumbs of pat
ronage to bestow. A place on the Board
of Prison Directors would fill the measure
of Charles Sonntag's ambition. Sonntag Is
one of the smallest of small fry office
seekers, yet Gage might justly be accused
of ingratitude If he failed to reward this
place-hunter, because Sonntag is willing
to render the Governor nearly any kind of
service desired in return for a Prison Di
rectorship.
Billy Herrin, manager of the Southern
Pacific Company's political bureau, has
agents of his own In the field. He is not
willing to accept estimates of Gage's
strength which come from Johnny Mac
kenzie. Dan Kevane, Alec Truman, Jack
Tyrrell, Ed Niles and Ben Fehaeman. Re
ports received by Herrin from his own
trusted agents do not confirm the stories"
told by the Burns push. On the contraryt
Herrin is confidentially apprised of the
fact that Gage's unpopularity is increas
ing. The lacn of Gage enthusiasm at the
San Jose convention was the thing that
caused Herrin to make an independent in
vestigation of political affairs in Califor
nia.
The Union League Club has tendered a
dinner to the Governor of New York. If
the much-banqueted visitor from the Em
pire State accepts the invitation to dine
with the league both Governor Gage and
Mayor Scnmitz will be invited to the
feast. The club of course must take the
risk incident to the presence of his Gage
ship. As M. H. de "Young is in Paris and
General Harrison Gray Otis in Los Ange
les the chances of a Gage disturbance are
somewhat diminished.
Citizens of the Empire State who may
be Interested in the welfare of their Gov
ernor are assured that famine does not
stare him in the face. Invitations to din
ner meet him at every curb. The feasting
of Governor Odell in ban Francisco will
lead off with a dinner at the Pacitic-
Cnion Club next Monday evening. The
giver of the banquet is K. \V. Harriman,
president of the Southern Pacinc Com
pany. Mayor .Eugene &. Scnmitz is one
of tne sixty invited guests.
It is current gossip tnat the distin
guished <jrovernor will, be the chief guest
a.t a dinner to be given by the .Mayor of
ban Francisco. The Mayor does not ro.ll
in the wealth of a Phelan, yet if he
should elect to convey the hospitality ot
isan .Francisco in tne shape of a banquet
the dinner given under his auspices
would surely ue a delightful lunction. tie
has tne true artistic conception of what
is fitting in form and color and he pos
sesses also the artist's appreciation of
music and flowers. A dinner given to
Governor Oaell under Mayor bchmitz's
immediate direction would be the poet's
idea of "a thing of beauty and a joy for
ever." With haif the money that a wealth
roller might squander in wine or waste
in grorgeous decoration an artist like the
Mayor could give a dinner that would af
ford intellectual delight to an apprecia
tive guest euch as the Governor of New
York. It might be quite in keeping witn
the proprieties of- the season tor the
to invite Governor Gage to the
dinner. One engaging in an enterprise â
even a beautiful enterprise â must now
and then assume a risk, and the Mayor
would have to take the chance of the
Governor doing something or saying
something to create a scene or an uproar.
Votes will cost 10 cents each and al
ready the young men have commenced' to
raise funds. Mrs. J. C. Flood of the
Academy booth will have charge of the
contest.
One of the attractions which is proving
most popular and is nightly drawing
flattering crowds is the Irish dance hall.
In this hall, which is in the gallery just
back of the art gallery, are executed
many of the old Irish jigs by dancers in
costume in a manner fit to make many
of the sons of Erin think of their younger
days when the lads and their lasses
danced beneath the trees . on Ireland's
green sward.
Superintendent Tidball is busy planning
new attractions and lje promises that the
best part of the programme Is yet to
come. It . has bfcen decided to hold a
grand carnival Thursday evening, May
22. A aueen will be chosen for the occa
sion. She will be crowned at 8:30 o'clock
in the evening and with her full retinue
will enter at once on . the pleasant duty
of ruling her subjects. It la expected
that the selection of a queen of beauty
and popularity great enough to entitle
her to adorn a throne of the exhibi
tion will occasion considerable rivalry.
A candidate : will be entered In the
race from each county and . proud will
that, county be which shall have the
honor of claiming her gracious majesty
as one of its fair daughters.
Thousands of people visited the fair
last night to view the attractions and to
be entertained by the ladies of Galway
and Kings County booths. The officers
of the Transvaal League of California
and a number of local Boer leaders were
present, the occasion being designated
"Boer night," In honor of t!he little South
African republic. In respect for the Boer
representatives the republic's nags were
fluttered from, the sides and tops of many,
of the booths. The band, under the di
rection of Professor Robert Allen, ren
dered a number of the Boer national
songs. ,
Galway's and King's booths both had
prepared delightful programmes of in
strumental and vocal music. The ladies
of these booths are working incessantly
for the success of the fair and their
efforts toward entertaining last night
were greatly appreciated.
â¢To-day the children will have g their
Inning at the festival. A special effort
will be made to please the little ones and
it is expected the pavilion will be crowded
with them. The merry-go-round, the
jaunting car and Punch and Judy will
all be at their best.
After one day's rest the Irish Fair, with
all Its artistic, representations of Erin's
historic castles and towers, with its vast
(Collection of fancy goods, rare curios and
beautiful articles, with its Irish dancers,
lightly and gracefully keeping step to the
spirited jig music, with its brilliant il
lumination and its still more brilliant
collection of Erin's fair daughters, was
again in full progress yesterday after
noon and last night. Each day and night
is adding to the~success of the great
festival.

MISS ELIZABETH CAINE.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â I want to tell you and all the young ladies
of the country, how grateful I am to you for the benefits I have received
from using Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I suffered for
eight months from suppressed menstruation, and it affected my entire sys-
tem until I became weak and debilitated, and at times felt that I had a
hundred aches in as many places. I onlv used the Compound for a few
weeks, but it wrought a change in me wnich I felt from the very begin-
ning. I have been very regular since, have no pains, and find that my
entire body is as if it was renewed. I gladly recommend Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound to everybody." â Miss Elizabeth Caine,
69 W. Division St., Fond du Lac, Wis. j
When the young girl's thoughts become sluggish, when she experi-
ences headaches, dizziness, faintness. and exhibits an abnormal disposi-
tion to sleep, pains. in the back ana lower limbs, eyes dim, desire for
solitude, and a dislike for the society of other girls, when she ia a mystery
to herself and friends, then the mother should go to her aid promptly.
At such a time the greatest aid to nature is r,ydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound. It prepares the young system for the coming change,
and is the surest reliance for woman's ilia of every nature.
TVTien you ask for Mrs. Pinkham's medicine at your druggist,
do. not be persuaded to take something else said to be "just as
good." Nothing in the world is so good for women's ills.

commanded the troops, did not treat the
natives right as he destroyed their sup

deliberately planned, and he judged that

it would not. be proper to determine at
this time on* a vote.
To-day's debate on the Philippine bill
was mild. Teller occupied time in oppo
sition to the measure. He contended
principally that the Filipinos were cap
able of self-government and were cap
able of establishing a government quite
equal to some European governments.

So confident were Flanigan's attorneys.
Messrs. Chapman, Clift & Me Wade, that
they agreed Â¦with the prosecution not to
argue the case, which was then sub
mitted.
Flanigan took the stand in his own be
half after Dr. O. D. Hamlin had described
the wounds he found on the face of the
accused the morning after the~-shooting.
He told a - straightforward story of has
troubles with O'Brien and how they had
quarreled in the saloon and later in
O'Brien's store. He denied having any
thing but a friendly regard for Gorman.
He was leaving the store under per
suasion when Gorman jumped upon him
and the pistol he had in his overcoat
pocket went off.
Austin O'Brien told about his fight with
Flanigan in a saloon and the attempted
cssaurt upon him afterward in his store
by Flanigan. He did not see the shooting
because his friends had locked him. In a
room to keen him from, getting into
trouble. \Vhen asked if he was not very
bitter against Flanigan and had. not hired
additional counsel to prosecute him he
admitted that that was true, but said he
did not want t.? see things go hard with
Flanigan.
Policeman George E. Ely was- the first
â¢witness this morning for the prosecution.
He said he came up in time on the night
of the shooting to see Flanigan and Gor
man struggling' on the sidewalk in .front of
O'Brien's ttore. Just as he "arrived the
shot was tired and he arrested Flanigan
after directing Gorman's friends to get
medical assistance. ' Â¦
Flanigan received the congratulation of
his friends when the words "not guilty"
came from the lips of the foreman. His
wife and two of his children were present
to hear the good news. They were kept
waiting two hours for the verdict because
a recalcitrant juror thought Flanigan' s
intended assault upon O'Brien had some
thing to do with the killing of Gorman.
When the court informed him that they
were separate actions, the juror fell in
line wiui his eleven fellows. -. .
"We were all agreed from the first,"
said Foreman Greer of the jury, after the
verdict had been rendered, "that the shot
was accidentally discharged. We believed
Flanigan' s story that he had no Intention
of killing Gorman. Gorman took chances
when he took part in that quarrel.

Dr. Hyde said: " "It is impossible as.yet
to state the cause of death. An examina
tion of the heart,' brain and stomach did
not. reveal any cause. . These organs 'will
be examined under a microscope to-mor
row, and the cause, will then be undoubt
edly revealed. I am not yet prepared to
say whether the cocaine that was admin
istered had anything to do with the
death. The heart does not show that nor
dees it show any of the usual forms of
heart disease."
"I gave Mrs. Pereira but one-slxteehth
of a grain." said Dr. Schmidt. "I knew
little of her physical conditions, and when
I am - not acquainted with the physical
characteristics of the patient I "never give
mere, though an eighth of a grain is Â«ot
a large dose. It is probable that a mi
croscopical examination of the heart will
reveal the cause of death, and that it will
not be attributed to the cocaine."
The cause of the death of Mme. Maria
Teresa Pereira, the wife of the. Chilean
Consul at San Francisco, who died in a
dentist's chair yesterday, afternoon, has
not yet been determined, and a more com
plete autopsy will be made before the in
quest to-morrow night. Dr. O. C. Hyde
made a superficial examination of the
brain, stomach and heart of the dead
woman to-day, but the condition of none
of these organs showed any particular
reason for death. Dr. Hyde has deter
mined to make a microscopical examina
tion of the muscles of the heart In the
hepe that this will reveal the cause of
death. fc
The fact that the heart does not ex
hibit any specific reason for death might
indicate that the cause is to be found in
the cocaine that was administered by
Dentist Schmidt while the teeth were De
ing extracted. . . Dr. Schmidt says that he
administered but one-sixteenth of a grain
of cocaine, while an ordinary dose is an
eighth of a grain.

POSTUM CEEEAL.
THE J. P.'S DECISION. )
He Sums Up the Coffee Case.
Judge W. W. Eowen of Creeds, Va., an-
nounces himself as a "reformed coffee
toper," and (rives authority to make the
following public statement:
"For years the coffee habit had been
growing on me until ray condition was
getting serious. I have considerable writ-
ing to do, and had become bo nervous
that I had to depend almost entirely upon
my wife to do the writing. Sometimes
when it was imperative that I sign my
name my hand trembled so I could scarce
do it.
"I had severe headaches, stomach trou-
ble, heart trouble; also some rheumatism.
A friend. Rev. , one day sent me a
package of Postum Coffee, with a request
that I give up coffee and make a fafr trial
of Postum.
"I took the advice, and the headaches
ceased; also the stomach trouble. I now
have no heart trouble at all except when
I use coffee for a time. My old nervous-
ness is a thing of the past.
"My wife also suffered for years with
heart trouble and extreme nervousness.
She has found relief by leaving off coffee
and using Postum. We now think it a
much better drink than either coffee or
tea. VI have known of a number of cases
that have been entirely cured or greatly
benefited by leaving off coffee and using
the new beverage, Postum,"

TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE
Collector Stratton said yesterday that
all that he required of transit coolies was
satisfactory evidence that they were go-
Ing somewhere outside of the United
States for some definite purpose and not
on a pretense of going to Mexico and then
slipping into the United States across the
border. 1 In the case of the ninety-eight
whose applications were denied, the Col
lector found that they did' not know
whither they were going, or why, and did
not know any person or firm in the coun
try of their pretended destination. More
over, ; they were without money. Several
test cases were made, and taken, before
United States District Judge de Haven on.
a legal proposition. He ruled in favor of
the Collector. Then the -United States
Circuit Court of Appeals was tried, 'and
it sustained Judge de Haven. ; As the
last resort, proceedings were taken be
fore the United States Supreme Court. at
Washington, and after several months of
waiting the court affirmed the action of
the Court. of Appeals.
The seventy-six remaining coolies . in
the- detention shed will be shipped home
as fast as the steamers of the lines on
which they came are ready to sail. In
transit Chinese for Mexico are looked
upon with suspicion, for wages In the su
gar plantations and other fields of labor
range only from $5 to $10 per month, and
Chinese coolies will not work ontside of
their own country for such small wages.
- Collector Stratton received a letter yes
terday from Ho Yow, Chinese Consul at
this port, asking that he reopen the cases
as a personal favor. The Collector re
plied that there was nothing, to reopen
and that the exclusion act did not provide
for personal favors.
Pigtailsovagrged merrily, on the gang
plank of the Nippon. Maru yesterday af
ternoon, and Chinese faces were wreath
ed with expansive smiles as twenty-two
Mongols boarded the vessel to be taken
back to China. They had , been confined
In the detention shed on the mall dock
for nine months pending the disposition
of appeals that had been taken by them
from the action of Customs Collector
Stratton in denying them permission to
pass through the United States or any
portion thereof on the way to Mexico.
There had been ninety-eight rejections in
all, the Collector finding the the applicants
were' not bona fide in transit travelers.

Reinsurance on the German ship H. F.

Glad* was very foul of bottom when she ar
rived her?, accumulated more marine speci
mens while lying in the harbor during the
strike and sailed from this port In first-class
condition for making a. slow passage. In spite
of the fact that she has not been spoken since
she left and in the face of the 80 per cent re
insurance, there are many that think she will
arrive safely at her destination. The rate on
the American bark Yosemlte still stands at 50
per cent. She left Newcastle. Australia 138
days ago frith a cargo of coal for Guaymas
She is considered a poor risk. The Yosemlte Is
well known in- this port and those best ac
qua'rted *vith the vessel have least hope of her
safety. She last sailed from this port July

Receipts of Navel Oranges are steadily de
creasing and the market is almost bare of fancy
fruit. Offerings are chiefly of choice and
standard varieties, which are- dull. Out of two
cars of Oranges offered at the auction there
were only 30 boxes of fancy Navels, which were
sold at $3 60 per box. The balance of the
offerings sold as follows: Standard Navels $1
@2 75; choice Mediterranean Sweets, 80cÂ®$l 40;
fancy Valencias, $1 50@2 50.
Cherries were lower under heavy receipts,
over 60O boxes being received. The white Cher
ries from Vacavllle Were poor and hard to sell,
b'.it the black were In better condition, although
some WerÂ« cracked by the recent rain and had
to bp sold at the bottom quotation.
Receipts of Strawberries were light and as
the demand was brisk the market cleaned up
at better prices. Seventy-five crates were re
ceived from Florin' and sold at $1 25 per crate.

NEW YORK STOCK LJST,
during the week of $2,875,000. The loan item
is, of course, a matter of surmise. The early
heavy liquidation in the stock market would
indicate a reduction of loans, but it appears
that some of the calling of loans in large
amounts was simply for the purpose of re
lending elsewhere, including possibly to the
ship merger underwriting syndicate. The
market ' closed dull and steady. Â¦
Bonds were easier, In sympathy with' stocks.
Total sales, $2,535,000. United States bonds
were all unchanged on the last call.
"The fruit outlook on the whole is reported
to be very favorable. A great deal of anxiety
has occurred for fear that the cold weather
would interfere with perfect pollenlzation and
a number of orchartiists report that early cher
ries and early prunes, especially in Clackamas
Cour.ty, have been badly damaged. Straw
berries and apple trees are now generally in
bloom in the Willamette and Hood River val
ieys, and in Southern Oregon."
"Hops, although slow in starting, are com
ing up well, and in the southern portion of the
State the work of training the vines is gen
eral.
"Cera planting is now in active progress in
Southern Oregon, and in the western sections of
the State the planting of late potatoes has be
gun.
"Feed on the ranges is Eplendid, and stock
in all parts of the State is doing nicely. In
the plateau region the increase in lambs has
been the heaviest in years. Sheep-shearing
is progressing slower than usual on account of
the cool weather. The clip is reported to be
good.
â¢Wheat, although backward, is very prom
ising, except in portions of the Willamette
\ alley, where it is becoming yellow on account
of the lack of sunshine. Spring wheat also
is unusually slow in germinating, but with the
ample moisture now in the soil a few days
of warm, eunehiny weather is all that is needed
to bring the grain crop out in excellent con
dition.
"With the exception of last Sunday, which
was mild and sunshiny, the weather of the
week has been generally cloudy, with frequent
showers, and altogether too cool for rapid
growth. There were several mornings with
Jifrht frosts, but as far as known they have
done no damage of consequence. The soil in
the wheat sections In the eastern part of ths
Â£tate is wet to a good depth, and all that
is row needed is warm weather to bring vege
tation forward very rapidly.
"Farm work generally has been greatly re
tarded on account of the wet weather, and
spring seeding in the Willamette Valley is not
yet finished. In Eastern Oregon the Boll is in
excellent condition for plowing, and good ad
vancement has been made in summer fallow
ing.
The report of Edward A. Beats, section di
ectcr United States Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin, week ended May 6, is

NEW YORK, May 9. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Stocks to-day were brisker and more cheer
ful. Investment issues were in good demand
on the- results of the Indian loan. For the
Â£1,500,000 issue offered at a minimum at Â©9
the applications amounted to Â£10,000,000. The
premium Is now 2%. Consols sold at 94#.
American shares were firm early, notably
Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, and they
roee briskly, but New York failed to respond
on the rumor that the coal operators had de
clined to arbitrate their differences with the
miners. The close was heavy and unsettled,
but Canadian Pacific was buoyant at 132% on
influential buying. There is a rumor that the
road has acquired Wisconsin Central, giving
it a Chicago outlet.
Rio Tintos were % up and copper sold at
Â£43 15s the ton.
Call rates for money strengthened on the
Indian loan demands.

is nothing lyce what it has been, and though re
ceipts have fallen off of late they are still
too heavy for the demand, which is slacken
ing up, as usual at this time of the year.
There is no change in Butter. There are

Failures, for the week number 218 ; in the
United States, against 187 last year, and 24
in Canada, against 26 last year.
More encouraging weather reports have made
the outlook brighter for a normal wheat yield.
Exports from all ports in the United States
during the week amounted to 3,377,379 bush
els, flour included, compared with 5,579,037
bushels in the preceding week. ... .,
Dispatches to this paper promise a large wocSl
clip, though the late spring hdB delayed shear
ing. There has been less selling of wool on
the sheeps' back. ... , â¢
Procrastinating consumers who predicted a
collapse in the iron and steel market similar to
the break that occurred two years ago have
greatly augmented the pressure by tardily at
tempting to supply- their requirements.
At a time when consumptive demand sur
passes all previous records in "the nation'* his
tory, it Is unfortunate that production should
be curtailed. Yet that is the present situation.
First, the labor controversies and a Â¦ tornado
stopped work at many points, greatly reducing
the output and many more wage disputes must
be settled before the end of the month or fur
nace fires will be banked and wheels cease to
revolve. Losses by the elements have been
severe, the largest tin plate plant in the world
being rendered idle probably for a month,
while many foundries and shops' were de
stroyed. Prices of commodities on May 1, as
shown by Dun's Index number, rose to â¢ the
highest point in recent years, gaining 6.3 per
cent over the corresponding date last year, "but
this week there has been a material decline In
some products, notably grain. Distribution
through retail channels, continues very heavy.
Railway earnings are steadily gaining, , full
returns for April exceeding last year's by 10.6
per cent and 1900 by 35 per cent.* .

tKcre have been two coal arrivals from Ore

fMSb tons; three from Washington, 7400 toi.s;
ore from Australia, 0103 tons; one from Swan
sea. 2161 tons; total. 2a. 094 tona. .The amount
at hand this week is below the average amount
received, at the same time it is fully up to
the amount called for. The present outlook fev
the consumption of coal is not at all flattering,
as consumers appear to be falling off monthly.
Prices are being reduced to offset the use of
oil, yet they do not appear to reach same suc
cessfully. Several steam colliers that hoÂ»a
been in the service for a considerable time, aro
for the moment retired, and it 13 questionable*
whnn they will be again called into requisition.
Australian ccals have been marked down tt>
prices heretofore unknown, and are not finding;
icady sale. The list of loading vessels at
Swansea is increasing, but that character of
coal is used almost exclusively for gas pur
poses, and is landed here at nearly $1 per ton
lew than last year. Coal will continue to hoM
the market for household purposes until soma
method may be devised by which oil may he
substituted."

NEW YORK, May 9. â The volume of deal-
Ings to-cay fell considerably below half a mil
lion shares for the first time In many weeks
Whether there v.-as any other reason for this
dullness than the decision on the part of thÂ«
speculators lately leading the market to let II
He fallow ior a time was not evident. Per
haps thÂ« Ions drawn out controversy over thÂ«
anthracite labor settlement may have beer
effective in discouraging speculative activity.
If that was the factor which Induced the cur
tailment of demand and the sagging of price;
In the ceneral list it did not appear among
the coalers themselves. That group was af
fected by the marked strength of Delaware
and Hudson. The Wall-street public is puz
zled t> know the grounds of the very positiv*
iiK^urer.ce which has been manifest among the
controlling Interest* in the anthracite trade
that there would be no strike. Their deter
mination has evidently not varied to offer nc
conces-sloni", while on the other hand the mlnÂ«
workers, in effect, are under contingent orders
to declare a strike unless the concessions arÂ«
eranted. The outcome was still waited when
the stock market closed to-day. There waÂ«
wine ehow of strength In the early dealing*
and an appearance of renewed activity on tue
part of the recently prominent market leaders.
Amalgamated Copper was conspicuously ac
tive and strong, advancing at one time 1%.
KejtortF were current that sales of copper had
been effected at 12MtC by a leading competitor
in sufficient amount to take it out of the mar
ket for some time to come. The announcement
that one of the suspended Stock Exchange
arms would be able to resume and that the
other two hoped to do co was regarded as a
eatlefactory development. Trading was re
sumed ir* International Power arfd It was
lifted four iwints. Louisville and Nashville
fell back after it* recent advance and there
was a drjo of lour point* in Chicago ami
Kastern Â¦Illinois. The weakness of Chicago and
Â¦Northwestern wae also associated with thfe
conflicting reoorts of , the admission to the
directory Â° r representatives of the Moore in
ternets who are reported to have acquired
large fccJdlng* of Etock lately. The-reaction
ary tendency of the market became more gen
eral after the apuearance of the preliminary
estimate of the week's currency movement. It
appears that the banks have received on bal
ance from the interior less than a- million
dollars against the loss to the Sub-Treasury
NEW YORK, May 9.â Bradstreefg to-mor
row will say: Improved weather conditions
furnished the keynote for the more cheerful
tone in distributive - trade. Copious rains
while not repairing all the damage to winter
wheat done by. the recent drouth in Kansas
seem to have put the rest of the croD out of
anything like immediate danger. The skua
tlon in manufacturing generally mav he
summed up in one word, "activity," the onlv
important exception to this being noted n
the woolen industry, which is interfered with
by strikes. The unsettled anthracite coal situ
ation also overhangs the Eastern trade situa
tion. Iron and steel ; trades are i still pushed
to the utmost tension to keep up with rut
rent demand. Building and allied - trades nV
pendent thereon are active despite the increased
price of lumber and of builders' hardware and
the higher level of wages. The feature in Iron
and steel is the scarcity of supplies of pig iron
and the strength of the demand for finish*,
products, particularly structural materials
what few rails are available- and whatever
tonnage can be secured of bars and plates
Among the other metals tin Is higher on the
week while copper is rather weak. '- â¢-.

The treasurer rendered a report showing
that the society is in excellent financial
condition. '
At the regular monthly meeting of the
California State Floral Society held yes
terday afternoon at Sherman-Clay Hall,
George AV. Dunn, a distinguished ento*
mologist who has spent Hhe greater part
of his eighty-eight years of life in the
forests of California studying the insects
and the wild flora, entertained the mem
bers with a very interesting description
of some of the rare specimens of Califor
nia's wild flowers. He also related some
of the exciting experiences which he had
in the pioneer days while pursuing his
studies in the woods. He told how he
waa lured to this State' in search of gold
and how the beautiful floral scenery had
induced him to make the far West his
home. He was given a rising vote oi
thanks for his dissertation and also ex
tended an invitation to attend all the
flower shows given by the society.
Mrs. John R. Martfn, . chairman of the
exhibition and award committee, which
has charge of the flower show to be given
in the south nave of the ferry building
the latter part of this month, reported
that great interest is being taken in the
exhibition by merobers-of the society and
by flower lovers in general. She also re
ported that an invitation had been ex
tended to the pupils of the higher grade.-!
oÂ£ the grammar schools, the children of
the orphan asylum's and the inmates of
the Old Ladies' Home to attend the show.

Sewer Pipe Inspector McDonald, who
was accused of offering a bribe to tha
Stockton company to keep it from bid
ding, resigned his position after the-
Council dismissed the charges against
him.
- Rejection of the bid3 and readvertise
ment are the results sought by the Stock
ton Pottery Company, the manager of
which filed the sensational affidavit con
taining charges against Inspector Mc-
Donald and members of the Council. On
account of these accusations, the . mem
bers of the Council decided that they
could not be impartial in the controversy.
Councilman Poland voted against the ref
erence to a committee and declared if the
Councilmen deemed themselves incompe
tent to deal with the question they ought
to resign.
EUREKA. May 9.â The City Council de
cided at a special meeting to-day to shift
the responsibility of determining the
sewer-pipe controversy, which has been
agitating ; the municipality for several
days to other shoulders, and by a vote
of four to' two passed the problem up to
ten leading citizens. The duty of the cit
izens whom the Council has named will
be to report on the advisability of accept
ing the best of the bids now on file or re
jecting all and readvertislng for bids
without the clause in the specifications
calling for the delivery of all of the pipe
within forty-five days.
Special. Dispatch to' The CalL
At the close of the service a death mask
of the Archbishop, was taken. The body
was placed in a casket, which was taken
to the crypt under the high altar and
placed in a vault beside the bodies of
Archbishop Hughes and Cardinal McClos
key. Bishop McQuaid of Rochester said
the final -prayers.
ROME. May 9.â It ia not likely that the
successor of Archbishop Corrigan will lie
nominated at the next consistory, and
probably more than a month will elapse
before action will be reached. It is there
fore probable that a capitalary Vicar will
be appointed to administer the archdio
ceses. Â¦ . .
After the sermon Cardinal Gibbons, ac
companied by four Bishops of the arch
dioceseâBishops Burke, Gabriels, Ludden
and McQuald â descended to the cata
falque. The five absolutions to which the
dead Archbishop by rank of office was
entitled were then given.
What, after all, is death to such a man as
this? What but a liberation, an illumina
tion, a union. A liberation from most press
ing duties and responsibilities, an illumination
when the light of God's face shall shine upon
him. and he will hold the- solutions of the
great problems of life and . the length and
breadth and height and depth of God's love.
and..Â«- union with the divine original, after
wljom he .was formed.
The Archbishop himself was as a rock â
mossy and yielding on the surface, but be
iieatli firm and immovable. . He was brave with,
the courage of God. , for whom alone he acted
aiÂ»d suffered. His humility seemed to make
him timid. I know, on the testimony of Car
dinal McCloskey. that he did all in his power
to prevent his name being sent to Rome foe
the dignity of Archbishop of New York. He
feared the awful responsibility. So did some
q! the greatest Bishops that ever lived, hut
when they had to accept the office they became
the bravest. ' " Â¦ â¢ , â¢- â¢ .
The three Archbishops of this great See were
types of different characteristic virtues. The
Most Rev. John Hughes stands â¢ out as the
striking exemplification of courage, when cour
age was much needed. . Cardinal McCloskey
waa distinguished for -his marvelous prudence,
by which he conquered without fighting. Arch
bishop Corrigan seemed to belong: rather to
the Cardinal McCloskey class of men. but when
principle was involved he was as immovable
as Archbishop Hughen. His motto. "Dominus
Petra Mea" (The Lord Is my rock), ' was first
that of the meek but brave patriarch Moses.
The cathedral was crowded when the
service began. At 10:30 o'clock the pro
cession of priests. Bishops and Arch
bishops witn Cardinal Gibbons entered
the cathedral. A Protestant Episcopal
minister, the .Rev, F. M. Clendenntng,
rector of St. Peter's Protestant Episcopal
Church, Westchester. walked In the pro
cession with Dr. Brann of St. Agnes' Ro
man Catholic Church. After the reading
cf the Gospel Archbishop Ryan of Phila
delphia preached the sermon, in the
course of which he said:
; A wreath of Easter lilies, white roses
and snowballs was received at the cathe
dral this morning from President Roose
velt. Another wreath bore the name of
John W, Mackay.
The officiating clergymen were: Cele
brant, Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore; as
sistant priest, the Right Rev. Joseph F.
Mooney, Vicar General ; deacons of honor
âthe Right Rev. John Edwards of the
Church of the Immaculate Conception
and the Rev. Colton of St. Stephen's; dea
con to the mass, the Rev. McGean of St.
Peter's; sub-deacon, the Rev. Father, La
velle. pastor of the cathedral; masters of
ceremoniesi-the Rev. James Connelly of
the Church of Our Lady and Good Coun
cil and the Rev. Thomas M. McMahon of
St. Stephen's; preacher, Archbishop Ryan
of Philadelphia.
Before 6 o'clock, the h<jur of the first
mass, there were 3000 persons around the
cathedral waiting for the opening of the
dpors. Five masses were said up to 8
o'clock, and as one congregation left the
large building another took its place. At
the end of the 8 o'clock mass the .doors
were closed so that preparations might be
made for the final ceremonies, which
were set for 10:30.
NEW YORK. May S.-yA requiem mass
for the repose of the soul of the Most
Rev. Michael Augustine Corrigan. Arch
bishop of New York, was said to-day in
St. Patrick's Cathedral by Cardinal Gib
bons of Baltimore, in the presence of.
eight Archbishops, eighteen Bishops and
more than 1000 priests of the. church.

CRUELTY LEADS

The harmony of sweet sounds that only
a -room full of babes can make will .not
reach the audience, as the walls of the
nursery will be deadened. In the event
every woman who attends the show
should bring an offspring, reinforcements
will be called in. Manager Friedlander
and a few of his assistants may -have to
take up the "white man's burden, V as it
is feared the assistants will. strike Jn
event of such a rush in the nursery. The
first rule to be put in force is . to bar
triplets. Friedlander says ho will stand
for twins on ordinary nights, but no
woman with, common-sense' would ask
the management to look after two or even
three pets for the price of one admission.
rirr ANAGER FRIEDLANDER of
f\l\\ Fischer's Theater is planning an
J7\v \1 Innovation that will please the.
A \l IV," mothers of San Francisco. He
intends Installing a nursery in
the playhouse for the benefit of its : pa
trons. The plan has been on his mind for
the last week and yesterday he hatched
it." His K scheme is a practical one, but
has Its good and bad points.'
For instance, mamma' may go to the
theater and check her j darling as she
Â¦would her umbrella and enjoy the play in
peace and quiet, well knowing that nursey
will feed the little darling on jujube paste
and other delicate baby, foods. ...Then,
again, if papa should drop the check he
receives for baby in a slot machine, be
lieving it to be a nickel, or mamma
sh'ould lose the receipt for the "kid,-'
1 there certainly will be hair-pulling in the
i nursery, i
It is even suggested to Mr. Friedlander
that some - practical joker might gain
access to the nursery and with evil in
tent change the tags on the baby's', bib
and tucker. If this was done, what an
uproar there would be if check 23 called
for a blonde baby with blue eyes and the
number, should be attached to a cross
eyed baby of dark complexion? ; .
Mr. Friedlander has weighed the
Echeme in his mind and he thinks it the
best ever sprung in this community. He
says it will not only be an inducement to
increase the population, but will fill the
coffers of Fischer's show house with
golden shekels. His idea is to have half
a. dozen brass cribs placed in a larsre,'
i well-ventilated room. He intends to
stock the room with rocking-horses,
| swings, dolls, toys and ping-pong so that
j babies may amuse themselves during
mamma's absence. Two or three inter
preters will be on hand to translate the
baby talk to the traineH nurses who will
look after their every want. A near-by
dairy will furnish fresh milk and lady
fingers will be fed to the little ones at
all hours.
