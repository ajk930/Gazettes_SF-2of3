Once his day's work at the offices of the
British Chartered' South Africa" Company
was over, he shut himself. up from the
curious in an unfrequented London hotel,
where he utterly denied himself to all ex
cept a half-dozen favored intimates. Dr.
Jameson was his constant companion. In
deed, none of Dr. Jameson's indiscretions
ever affected the warm friendship exist
ing between the two men. .They could be

JAMESON HIS COMPANION.
The death of Rhodes came as no great
surprise to those'few'who saw ; anythlng
of him during, his last, visit to Ixindon
during the winter. Whether.lt was due to
his experiences durjng the long siege of j
Kimberley or the accumulated anxletlea
rV- gartflng the war. In South Africa, with,
an accompanying 'change of public feeling
in England' toward him. there is no doubt
he: was- almost; completely ..broken- down j
.within. the last two years. _.Even;hls ap
pearance'changed; His once finely chis
eled face had become^ bloated, and his al
ways huge frame., filled out until he be
came so stout as: to make walking a mat
ter of difficulty.' 'He was further attacked
with severe heart troubles,' during, which
he maintained the stoicism which marked
his extraordinary career. Nor did "he al
low h!s bodily aliments to interfere with
business. Among his associates in the city
he never mentioned them, nor did he per
mit them to be mentioned to, him. Up* to
the last Rhodes" kept a firm grip on all
those vast South African interests created
and controlled by him. Except that he was
more irritable and more dictatorial, there
was no outward change In his method of
handling men, business and empires.

LONDON, March 2".â A dispatch , from
Capft'Town in this morning's Daily Ex
press says that X>r., Jameson Is authority
for the staternent that Cecil Rhodes left
Groteschuur, his residence near Cape
Town, to the people of that city, as well
as large sums of rnoney to charities.

/Financially, Rhodes* death is not likely
to have any very far-reaching results, as
all * his enterprises -were systematized Â¦ so
thoroughly \as riot to need the master

ception. . . â¢ ': % .-;'--v'
/Owing/to.the very great success of the
De Beers "Mines," the British Chartered
South Africa Company and the other
great South African ventures, Rhodes'
fortune had -been steadily accumulating.
Hei lost money over, the war, but; wtfat
inroads that made must have been trif
ling compared with the many millions he
possessed. -He never lost his open-handed
but somewhat, reckless methods > of
handling money.' Not long ago he walked
into Â¦ the. office of one of his confidential
subordinates and threw down a bundle
of. notes, bonds, etc., saying "Invest these
forme," 'and went out without waiting
.to have them looked at. Inspection re
vealed the fact that they amounted to
more than a million pounds sterling. How
they ,were Unvested; Rhodes r never knew,
or cared, for' months/ later, as that night
he.went off on^one of his wandering, tours
arid , refused to allow himself to be both

of his millions until he returned to Eng-'

yet severely unobservant of- the hundreds
of ' London's political and social leaders,
who had the rjght to a bowing acquaint

ably neverquite forgavo Cbambcrlaifi-ahd
Lord vMIlnerf for not consulting him or en
deavoring: to utilize the powerful finan
cial-political machine which Rhodes Un
doubtedly manipulated over the whole of
South Africa. With increasing irascibility,
which he did/not hesitate to vent on Duke
or plebeian' who crossed his path, he grew
more and moro restless as the end of his
life drew near. He. was never contented
to stay long in one place. His closing
days developed into an unceasing, pur
poseless quest of change of scene. Dur
ing his recent trip to Egypt this was par
ticularly noticeable. He rushed from
place to place, as if with the only object
of. upsetting his own plans. Then he sud
denly returned to England.-' . :

of the pending bill. - -
.To that end he has asked for a reopen
ing of the. case and requested an oppor

mittee,-with a view to forcing definite
action.,
OTHERS MAY BE CALLED.
It is said upon reliable . authority that
a majority of the committee are opposed
to action upon the bill at the present ses
sion:-.. The me asure -was- "originally *Â«Â«ned
by'br ..with; the sanction of Secretary
Root and at . h}s . request .was introduced
Jn "the. Senate, by Senator; Hawjey, chair
man of the committee.' After it was pub
lished it provoked so much criticism that
the original draft was destroyed and Sec
retary-Root was given an opportunity 'to
reconstruct his bill. The statement - of
Lieutenant General Miles did great dam
age to the bill.. Secretary Root, however.
Is not satisfied to have his pet measure
bound, gagged and placed in solitary con
finement by the Senate Committee on
Military Affairs and leave the latest state
merits of General Miles before the cona
! riiittce unanswered.
Secretary Root has declared his intui
tion" to renew the fight 1 to rescue his staff
bill to Increase the efficiency of the army,
which Is new pending .before the -Senate
Committee on Military Affairs. Notwith
standing the Miles Incident in connection
with this bill, and the evident Intention
cf the committee to allow the bill to lan
guish and die. Secretary Root proposes to
lead a rescuing party and force Congress
to pass favorably cr unfavorably upon
the measure which he deems of such vital
interest to the army.
WOULD HEARING.
He has requested permission to reappeur
before the committee" and reply to the
supplemental statements of Lieutenant
General Miles, in which the latter severely
criticized the Secretary of War and those
who are supposed to be In sympathy, with
Secretary' Root in remodeling the staff
department of . the army. In ,'attempting
to force action by Congress on the army
bill the Secretary evidently intends to
make Ihe contest a fight to a finish be

This closed Morgan's testimony,' and tba

George F.^ Baker will be called."
Morgan said it was never contemplated
that the holders of Northern Facific pre
ferred could change that stock for com
mon stock. The -retirement of the pre
ferred stock as early as possible was
part of the reorganization plan of 1SD<5.
The retirement, however, was not prac
ticable until after, common stock sold at
par or above. The preferred stockholders,
the witness thought, would have changed
their shares, for common stock if . they
had had. the opportunity. , .'
There was a friendly cross-examination
of Morgan by Francis: Lyndc Stetson. To
him the witness said the retirement of the
Northern .Pacific preferred stock was not
part of the plan which culminated, in the
formation of the Northern Securities
Company, nor was, It part, of a plan to
allow- the Northern Securities Company
to obtain the majority of Northern Pa
cific common. t Morgan denied that there
was any understanding or agreement in
the organization of the Northern Securl-
Ups Company looking to the control of
rates or traffic, or any agreement that
would in any manner obstruct or contem
plated the obstruction of commerce. Ho
said;that all parties to tho agreement
had acted Independently. "

fore the Cabinet yesterday, but strict reti

which was decided upon. From what can
be -learned, the imperial Government has
suggested that ' the ' force should be
equipped and transported at its own ex
pense. The application doubtless will be
acceded to, and should this prove to be
correct Canada's contribution of troops
will be brought up to a total of 7000 men.
In concluding Burleson predicted that

another interchange of notes between the

Thomas was i disingenuous and i produced
certain papers and letters in support .of
his, contention. He said that it was not
a passport for Dr. Thomas which was de
sired, â¢ but the good offices of the State
Department to secure a permit to enable
Dr. Thomas to get through the Boer lines.
Hay's letter to Hitt, he declared, was "an

I Delarey Escapes' a Cordon. . . .
| Incomplete â¢ reports : of the - result of the
combined ' movement of British columns
against General Delarey have enabled
Lord . Kitchener to announce the capture
of over a hundred prisoners, three fliteen
pound guns, two pompoms and quanti
ties of . stock, wagons. â¢ ete. General De
larey appears to have successfully, evadtd
Lord Kitchener's cordon at the outset.
In a dispatch dated from Pretoria at noon
yesterday Lord Kitchener says:
; At dusk on the - evening of March 23 the
combined movement against Delarey was un
dertaken by columns of mounted ! men without
guns or impediment of any sort. The colu/n_ns
started . from . Commando Drift, on the v aal
River,: and traveled, rapidly all- night, and at
dawn March 24, occupied positions along the
line from Commando Drift to tne Lichtenburs
blockhouse line. The troops moves rapidly
eastward, keeping a continuous line, with the
object of driving the enemy against the block
houses or forcing an action. The result : ha*
not yet been fully reported. Kekewich's col
umn, after the commencement of the action,
captured three flf teen-pounders, two pompoms,
nine prisoners and a-iiundred mules, carts and
Wagons. General Kitchener's column . cap
tured' eighty-nine prisoners, .forty-five carts
and wagons and' a thousand cattle. There are
a few more prisoners on the blockhouse line.
The troops covered eighty miles in twenty-four
hours. Bochfort's and Rawllnson's columns
have not yet reported their results.
Lord Kitchener in a later message says:
"All the reports are now. in. Th* total
number of prisoners is 135.".

CINCINNATI, March 26.â Samuel Gom
pers, president of . the American Federa
tion of Labor, continued the . taking of
evidence to-day in his efforts to settle the
differences which resulted in the lockout
of the brewery workmen here. No re
sult, was reached.' During the day Miss
Geralda Malone of San Francisco. Miss
Ruby Payne of New York and Miss Sallie
Fisher of Salt Lake made application to
President Gompers for a union of chorus
girls. ...
â¢ Senator Hanna isone'of the most earn
est advocates of the cause of arbitration,
and he presented . the situation from bis
viewpoint with sucn force that Morgan
was convinced that the operators should
yield a point; Morgan is in control of
some of the. coal roads, and is in a posi
tion to decide upon the course of action
to be taken without reference to any
other coal magnates. - He sees no particu
lar objection to recognizing the United
Mine Workers of America, as the union
is called, through his signing of contracts
with the individuals employed, especially
if the present wage scale can be main
tained tor another year. He does not be
lieve that the union is particularly strong
with the -miners. He will agree to terms
that he deems reasonable . and Senator
Hanna was jubilant when he left him,
being convinced that the strike would
be averted. ,â¢ : .;:/
The' announcement was made last night
on , the ' best authority -after Senator
Hanna's conference with J. P. Morgan,
and the threatened trouble will be^ averted
mainly- through the efforts, of the two 1
men who were the chief factors' In settling
the big strike in the Presidential cam
paign of. 1900. * -
There is no likelihood of a strike, in the
anthracite district this year. The miners
have formulated their ; demands and the
operators will probably meet them half
way.

Paine's Celery Compound
Â¦: Tie Best Mpiator
anil StreDithenfir for OM People.
Its Use Insures Freedom From
the Infirmities That Come
With Advancing /
It Bestows on the Aged a Condition of Con*-
fort, Happiness and PeaoÂ« That NÂ» '
Other Agency Can Giva.
We should give careful attention to th9
physical welfare of the aged in our
homes. Their chief troubles are constipa-
1 tion, flatulence; drowsiness, rheumatism,
neuralgia, and indigestion. â¢ 'Â»
Paine's Celery Compound is the world 3
best medicine for all the besetting trou-
bles of the old. Its regulating influenco
on the liver, kidneys and bowels removes
the disorders that come to the aged.
"When you are old Paine's Celery Com-
pound stimulates the vital powers, regu-
lates digestion and promotes a health/
appetite. . It builds you up and add3 years
of comfort, happiness and peace to your
life.
Rev. Dr. "Wm. A. Smith of Groton.
Conn., one of the best known divines in,
Southern New England, sends the follow-
ing letter, that deserves careful reading:
"I am now 86 years of age. and during
my long life have suffered greatly from
dyspepsia, torpid liver, constipation and
insomnia, at times thinking I should dJa
for want of sleep. f
"By the use of several bottles of. Paine Â»
Celery Compound I have so far recovered
my health as to consider myself a well
man for my age. My appetite Is now
good, my sleep is refreshing, my liver,
active and bowels regular, and my
crutches not needed."
See that you get PAINE'S, the kind
that makes old people active, fresh and
young. Look for the name Paine's on
each bottle and wrapper. If you are of-
fered any. other kind you are getting a
substitute that is worthless.

WASHINGTON, March 26.â One of the
first acts by the President consequent
upon the ratification of the treaty for
thr acquisition of the Danish West Indies,

the appointment of a Governor for the

S<>STed to the President for this office, one
of which is that of Jacob A. Riis, the
well-known newspaper writer of New

ably oisDosed toward Mr. Riis, for whom
he has a very high regard and with whom
he Is well acquainted because; of their as

tary of Millionaire Rice, who confessed r.n

sponge. in.:a cone over his sleeping em
ployer's face, no one connected i with the
District Attorney's office would say.
Jones. is ..not under indictment for mur

indictment' for forgery or conspiracy. He
testified on. the witness-stand that he ex,
pected- to receive some Immunity for his
confession.- Pressed by Metre to say that
he had been' promised absolute immunity,
he denied that this was so. Since cutting
his threat in an attempt to kill himself in
the Tombs, Jones, under the constant sur
veillance of police officers, has resided at
a private boardlns-house . up town, with
the exception of a brief time in the
House of Detention, where he tried to
starve himself to death. \ '

hearing before Justice Jerome and were

This question of a differential has .been
the. topic of nearly all of. the discussion
on the reciprocity question for the last
two days In the .White House. The Pres
ident is now opposed to It.
It is eaid to-night that Representative
Babcock stands ready to. vote for the
Payne bill without -amendment. â¢ This be

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Representative Clark of Mlnsouri has
reserved the right to make a dissenting
report apalnst the employment of Chinese
sailors on American ships.
VFAJ3HIXGTON, March 26.â The report
cf-the House committee on the Chinese
exclusion bill was tiled to-day by Repre
sentative Perkins of New York, who
drafted it. Tie report isays in part: â¢
"The committee is unanimous in the
opinion that the admission of Chinese la
borers Into ihis country would be a. very
serious evil. Kvery endeavor has been
inaxid to report an act which will secure
tbe txcltiion of Chinese coolies. We rec
ognize tne fact that frauds under the
present exclusion laws result chiefly from
the abuse of transit privileges and the
Imxoduction of Chinese claiming to be
merchants, who are really laborers. We
have endeavored to guard against these
evils.
"On the other hand, this country desires
to obtain its fair share of commerce with
the Kast acd with China, and In our
treatment cf the privileged classes, tne
genuine merchants, students, etc., allowed
by tbe treaty to enter this country, we
have endeavored to avoid any discourtesy
or annoyance which was not required to
prevent fraud."
The report says the few provisions of
the Kahn bill stricken out were such as
might have brought into question the
constitutionality of the measure. The re
port further says:
"The committee has stricken out the
provision of the 'Kahn bill which forbade
the employment of Chinese on ships
carrying- the American flag on the Pa
cific. We regard this provision as foreign
to the purposes of the bill, which is to
prevent the entry of the Chinese into thin
country. We also regard it as Injudicious.
The result of such a provision would be
to compel steamships that now fly the
American flag on the Pacific te take Brit
ieh register. Tills is certainly not the
way to build up our merchant marine, for
wliich there is a great demand. The work
done by the Chinese on the*e ships in the
lnlcnve heat of the tropics Is work which
our American workmen could not do,
should not do and would not do."
BAIL IS DENIED
CUBAN CONVICTS
In anticipation of a scene, of. excite
ment in event of a verdict of guilty, the
usual step was taken of ordering all
women to leave the courtroom. Among
them were the prisoner's two sisters and
Mrs. Francis, with whom he boarded.- Â¦
. With '.grave faces the members of the
jury filed into their places, and some
minutes of painful tension' elapsed while
messengers-were endeavoring to find the
counsel, who had' departed, not - expect--
Ins a verdict-, for many hours.- " Â¦ ;.
Calm -as.' ever, ',and -with confidence
seemingly , unshaken, i the prisoner - was
escorted' into the courtroom. He ' walked
rapidly, and took his stand facing the
jury with bead erect and hands loosely
clasped behind his back." ' . '
~At the word "guilty,"' pronounced bv
Foreman Machell in a ' tone low 'but
distinct enough to be heard throughout
the. court, not the slightest change
passed over Patrick's face, and he ' re
mained, standing .in an almost listiess
attitude while, the customary poll of the
jury was being taken. His aged father
Captain Patrick, sitting near him and
straining to catch the statement of the
foreman, started , for an instant as it? im
port reached him. and then sat calmly
awaiting 'the furtht-r proceedings. i
A smile'of triumph lit up the face of'
Assistant District Attorney Osborne. who
hastened , from the. court immediately
after Recorder Goff had. at the reques't
of the prisoner's counsel, fixed a week
from Monday as the day on which to
pronounce sentence.
The verdict was known almost lmme-
At the close of Recorder GofTs charge,
which occupied the morning session of
the court, tne Jury retired. This was at
1:50 p. m. At 5:55 they notified the offi
cer In charge that they were ready to
return to court,' rather more than an
hour cf the intervening time having been
devoted to luncheon. . , .
"Guilty", Finds the Jury.
There are three main propositions .â¢ In thla
case, and if they fail â¢ ot satisfactory proof
the > whole fabric of the prosecution fails. The
propositions are, tirst: . Did Charlea t.: Jones,
on September 23/ 1900, - with the intent, to kill,
place a towel, cone with a sponge saturated
with chloroform, Â» on the . face of W.* M.. Bice; â¢
second. Â»dld â¢ \V. M. Rice : die ; from the effects
of chloroform and , from â¢ no other cause;" th;rdr
did' the defendant, with, the intent- to procure
the Â¦ death of . W. 'M. Klce; counsel and Induce
Jones td place the chloroform over his face?
If you nnd that Patrick. did counsel Jones
and! that. Jones did kill Mr. Klce, .the. guilt. of
the defendant is not lessened because Patrick
was not present. Neither shall you deem it
lessened it you find that Jones was . easily ' in
duced to do the murder. . - . >â¢â¢-'â¢
The fact that Jones is a self-confessed mur
derer does : not make' him > an incompetent wit
ness. But' the evidence of such an accomplice
should be received with great caution. The'
law says It shall not; be accepted unless It Ma
corroborated." This does -not mean that there
must have been an eye witness to the-crlrje.
It means that either direct or -circumstantial
evidence pointing to the. same end shall con
vince you of the truth of the testimony.- .
You must take Into consideration Jones' man
ner on the stand; his apparent .capacity to re
member-details, his admission that- he. made
previous statement* that .were untrue and his
apparent frankness In telling of his own part
in a treacherous murder. Then you will, ask
yourselves was he actuated by- a motive -to
sacrifice Patrick to save himself?-.. If so,' why
did he select Patrick? -
The prosecution claims to have traced Â¦ to
the possceslon of the defendant the general
assignment and . other alleged forged docu
ments. If you believe this, has been proved -I
charge that you may hold that the failure of
the defendant to produce ' those papers may
be. taken as , evidence . that if. produced they,
would be harmful to the defense. . . r . .
The Recorder said, further, that' If -the
Jury believed that mercury or. other pol-
Bon had been given to Rice for the pur
pose of hastening his death, they mi;;ht
take into consideration his weakened
power of. resisting the chloroform.

TOPEKA, Kans., March 2G. â General
Frederick Funston was in this city to
day on his way to California. General
Funston delivered himself of a scathing
denunciation of the Eastern newspapers
which criticized his speech before the
Lotus Club In New York. He said:
'"I have been nagged by that class of
capers until I am tired. Editorially they
willfully misinterpret my remarks, and
1 am gl.id to express my Independence cf
their opinions and their talk and that
of their kind about my using: dishonora
ble and unfair means in the capture of
Aguinaldo; also that I. violated the ar
ticles of war. They know a great deal
more about che articles of golf than they
do about the articles of war. . Everything
is permissible in a campaign except the
uso of poison or the violation of a flag
of truce.
"As a matter of fact, only four of my
men were dressed In the insurgent uni
form. The others were dressed as Fil
ipino peasants. President Roosevelt ap
proved heartily of my remarks before
the Lotus Club banquet, and was very
anxious to have me go to Boston on the.

were such that it was Impossible for mo

some phases .of : it .were amusing. . :
- Hansbrough of North Dakota concluded

margarine' Industry had been outlawed by
the Legislatures \ of many \ States, and
that it ought to ; be made by Congress
to take, off its mask and place its product
on the market "for. what, it really is.
Stewart of Nevada, declared that tfce
proposed legislation was unnecessary and
that there -Was no more reason' for tax-
Ing colored oleomargarine than for lax
ing colored butter. -

SOCIETY OF ABTISTS
MAKES GOOD PROGRESS
Car 5S "of . the Sutter street line about
5:30 o'clock last night ran into a "bumper"
a few feet below the power-house at 'the.
corner of Sutter and, Polk streets; Several
passengers were, injured, while others
were shaken up and frightened.
Gripman C. Yates 'was. in 'charge of the
car and Harry Doling was the conductor.
According to the : statements made by the
men to Secretary, Stevens and Assistant
Superintendent .Grimes, a wagon was iu
the way as the. car approached â¢ the "let
go" point.- When the -car reaches this
spot the gTlpman' is expected to release
his hold until he reaches the. "take up"
point. The Intervening wagon prevented
this. As a result the^passengers on the
car were badly shakA up and injured.
Mrs.- Clussmann and her husband, living
at 1540 Central avenue, who were on the
car, were knocked from the seat. Mrs.
Clussmann was taken home in an ambu
lance suffering from nervous. prostration.
Delo Mato, a yountr man about 22 years
of age, who was standing on. the front
platform- of the car, was also knocked
down. In falling his neck struck against
the rail guarding the platform, and he re
ceived a severe concussion of the spine.
He was taken to his home at 1325 Broad
way.
â¢ The car. was badly damaged and was
turned into the carhouse. \ Traffic on the
road was delayed for some time. Gripman
Yates was arrested on a charge of bat
tery, but' was immediately released on de
positing $20 bail.
The preliminary steps toward the or
ganization of a local chapter of the Amer
ican Institute of Bank Clerks were taken
at a largely attended meeting of banking
clerks in the* rooms of the. Chamber of
Commerce last night; .A. H. R. Schmidt
of the <5erman Savings and Loan Society
presided. About 200 bright young men
were In attendance. ..."'
""In calling the.meetlng; to order Schmidt
explained the purpose of the gathering.
It was designed to unite the members of
the banking fraternity in, social and fra
ternal bonds and to h educate members
along business lines, particularly those
of finance and political economy. It was
also designed to Inaugurate a school of
banking, ln which members, of the chap
ter may be educated in the deeper prob
lems of the business ln which they are en
gaged. . -
Â¦Â¦ Lovell White of the San Francisco Sav
ings- Union delivered a brief address, in
which he urged the formation of a chap
ter in San Francisco as being a step in
the right direction. While banking clerks
were strictly up-to-date In- the question
of morals and religion, some of them did
not know more of banking, than was good
for them. He believed the social! and
business standing of the -clerks would be
greatly enhanced by the formation of a
chapter... Â¦-
Step in. Right Direction.
â¢ - F. E. Beck of the Anglo-Californian
iBank, on being called upon for an ad
dress, said he believed the proposed or
ganization would be a vast benefit to the
banVing men of San Francisco. He con
gratulated those present upon the deter
mination shown by them to better them
selves as a class. Every ambitious and
studious banking clerk should take a per
sonal interest in- the proposed organiza
tion, because it was. designed to advance
them to a better understanding of the in
tricate problems i which confront them
daily ln their business. The speaker read
a letter from Banker P. M. Lilienthal,
cordially indorsing the movement and ex
pressing regret that it- was not started a
year ago. - - < Â¦
Addresses were made by I. F. Moulton
of the \Bank of California. F. L. LIpman
of-AVells, Fargo &>.Co.'s Bank and J. K.
Lynch, First: National Bank. The speak
ers^werei warmly applauded.

Latest developments, to the Fuller case
have caused the police to utterly abandon
all clews hitherto. followed in trvinff to
trace out the mystery pi. the crime and
adopt an entirely new line of investiga
tion. : It has been casually mentioned that
Nora Fuller had some aspirations tend
ing toward the stage, but it has only been
learned within the last few days that srus^
went so far as to apply to several man
agers and theatrical agencies for a chanc*
to enter the theatrical profession, btia
was. known to have sought the company
of certain, aspirants of her own sex for
stage honors. â¢..-.â¢'-; . .
Among those with whom the murdered
girl ia said to have been intimate was a
young lady named Estelle Baker, who
was clever, at musical composition and
exceedingly anxious to appear in vaude
ville. ' She was given a rehearsal at trie
Orpheum, but her ability was not suf
ficient to gain her a public hearing, so
she. was sent out to the Chutes, where
she appeared one night. ' .
She was in the habit of appearing at
the Olympia on Friday nights, which U
set apart for amateurs, and Information,
has reached the police department that
Nora Fuller was present in her dressing
room on several occasions when AI133
Baker was at the Olympia. The theater
people say they have no knowledge on
this subject and are Inclined to doubt
the sources of the Information obtained
by the polloe. ; " Â¦: '*Â¦
Miss Baker is supposed to be Â¦ In Lcs
Angeles at present and communication
was established yesterday with the police
of that city on this subject. It Is hoped
that her intimacy with Nora may lead to
some valuable information regarding tna
male companions of the murdered girl.
The theory now being followed by the
police Is that the murderer is connected
in some way with the theatrical profes
sion and that the bait .which lured the
victim from her home and induced her
to send a false telephone message to her
mother on the night of her disappearance
was a promise to make It possible for her
to go on the stage. From knowledge pos
sessed by the department Captain Sey
mour is greatly encouraged that this last
theory will finally develop the Identity of
the heartless slayer of the confiding child..
Jules Deblaye, an aged inmate of the
Almshouse, has been missing from that
institution for seven months, and his Â¦wife
has enlisted the services of an attorney,
to conduct a search for -him. Major
Schmitz has also been requested lo.inves-
tigate the disappearance, a^id the attaches
of the Almshouse may be asked by him.to
explain why steps were not taken to.lo
cate Deblaye after his disappearance.' i ;
Deblaye had been an inmate of the
Almshouse for nearly four years. He was
partially paralyzed and at times his mind
vai affected. On or about the 10th of Â¦
August Deblaye left the institution in
Bcme mysterious way. His disappearance
did not become known to those in charge
until nightfall, and. as it was thought that
he had simply grown "tired of confinement'
and had indulged a.desire to escape little
attention was^pald"' to 'Â¦ his .sudden leave
taking. *-â¢* ' '. ' â¢'"
About the middle of August Mts. De- 1
blaye called at the " Almshouse to see her
husband, and was informed that' he had
left there of his own accord. .None of the
Inmates had seen "him take Ms departure
and little could be learned of his disap
pearance; i.
Believe He Is Dead.
Mrs. Deblaye. who Is an age.d ; woman,
talks little English; and she left, the Aims
house with a very meager idea'bf the cir
cumstances surro'ilnding'"' her ~ husband's
departure. Duringtlie last three or%four
months she had become an- -object" of
charity, and. at -the suggestion of kind
hearted women. --who are aiding her she.
Â¦wrote several letters to a local attorney
requesting him to dear up the mystery.
It is the opinion of those investigating
the case that Deblaye met a tragic death
shortly after he left the Almshouse. His
limbs were badly crippled, and as he was
in very poor health he could have scarce
ly succeeded In getting down town. The
Emergency Hospital records show that no
one answering the description of Deblaye
was brought to the hospital for treatment
at any time during the month of August.
If Deblaye had succeeded- In making his
way down town he would have gone to
the home of his -wife, at 34 Birch avenue.
They were very .much attached Â¦ to each
other, and her home would undoubtedly
be the first place he visited. : But Mrs.
Deblaye saw noth nsof her husband after
Fhe visited him at the. Almshouse during
the month of July. , - u^--- f â¢
Hay Have Been His Body.
On the 11th of August the body, of an
aged cripple was picked up in the bay off
the Presidio life-saving station. He car
ried a crutch, and the clothes and gen
eral description fits these of Deblaye. The
body had not been In the water very long.
It was never identified, and it is not un
reasonable to believe that it was the body
of the missing Deblaye.
During the four years that Deblaye was
en Inmate of the Almshouse he won the
good will of all the attendants. During
the last year he became quite feeble and
at times was morose and despondent. He
never threatened suicide, however, and
when he was missed the officials thought
that ht had gone home to his wife.
Mrs. Deblaye Is satisfied that he is dead
In talking of 1 the matter yesterday the
eald: ...'â¢â¢
"I feel that he is dead. If he had suc
ceeded In getting in town when he left
the Almshouse he would have come to
visit me. I have called at the Almshouse
several times about my husband's disap
pearance, but the attendants could not
give me any information. I am sure he
could not have walked very far. as he
was paralyzed on the left side and his
limbs wore practically useless. About
four yearn ago he fell down and broke
his leg. He was taken to the City' and
County Hospital for treatment, and after
his discharge he was unable to work. I
tried to make a living for both of us bu
it was a. hard struggle. Finally he be
came Â«ick and went to the Almshouse. I
UFed to visit htm at least once a month.
h l n I w . ent there ln -August they tol.1
ir>Â«Â» he had gone away. I did not believe
them at first: I thought they were trying
f?Â°L me * J don't think my husband
could have left the Almshouse alone I
don t. see how he could have walked
Â£22$ Tbe- laÂ«t -JLSme I saw him he was
\er> reoble and badly crippled. He could
scarcely walk then. I am sure if the of
ficials had looked for him when he disap
peared they would have found him. They
made no efforts whatever to find him. I
have written a letter to an attorney, wha
has promised to look Into the matter." ,

To be sure a largo amount of advertising was
necessary In the first' instance to bring the rem-
edy to the attention of the public, but everyone
familiar with the subject knows that advertis-

undeniable merit, and this the new catarrh euro
certainly possesses ln a marked degree. . -t-
Physlclans, .who formerly depended upon In-
halers, sprays and local washes or ointments,
now use Stuart's Catarrh Tablets because, as
one of the most prominent stated, these tablets
contain tn pleasant, convenient form all the
really efficient catarrh remedies, such as red

the stomach. I bought a fifty, cent package of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at my druggist's, car-
ried them in my pocket and used them faithful-
ly, and the way ln which they cleared my head
and throat was certainly remarkable. I had no
catarrh last winter and spring and consider my-
self entirely free from any catarrhal trouble."
Mrs. Jerome Ellison of Wheeling. W. Va..
writes: "I suffered from catarrh nearly my
whole life and last winter my two children also:
suffered from catarrhal colds and sore throat so
much they were out of school a large portion ot
the winter. My brother, 'who waa cured of ca-
tarrhal deafness by using Stuart's Catarrh Tab-

so and. am -truly thankful for what they have
done for' myself and my children. I always
keep a box of the tablets tn the house and at
the first appearance of a cold or sore throat we
nip it ln the bud and catarrh is no longer a

â¢ WOODLAND, March 26.â A mystery
Â¦which has been engaging the attention of
the Sheriff's office for several, days was
partially - cleared to-day. One day last
week Constable Johnson of Davisville
brought to the County Jail a man whom
he had found wandering about aimlessly.
Papers were found which 'indicated that
the man's name was JoTm Wege. These
papers established^ the - Â«act_ that - John
Wege enlisted In 'Company F, Sixteenth
Infantry," at Piqua. Ohio. Un. February.
1899; that he served three years in the
Philippines and was Bonorably discharged
on the 5th of March, 1902; that he re-en-
Usted on- March 15, 1902, in ; Company^ I,
Twentieth Infantry. They further showed
that Wege had first been promoted to the
rank of corporal and afterward to ser
eeant major. , Wege received $203 in pay
when discharged, but did not have, a cent
on his person when found. . - -
To-day the prisoner suddenly recovered
his" reason, fie remembered that Com-'
pany.I. Twentieth Infantry, In which .he
enlisted after his honorable discharge on
March 15, left San Francisco for Fort
Sheridan,- Illinois, on March 17. Wege wag
detailed. to help load' the baggage. He
felt unwell and, told one of his comrades
he would report to .the hospital. He was
dissuaded from doing this lest his supe
riors might think he was trying to shirk
work. He has no recollection of anything
thafoccurred after the baggage was load
ed until he regained consciousness in the
County Jail.-. â¢â¢Â¦-Â¦ ' "
Under Sheriff Brown to-day sent a tele

When I was elected, four years ago, .to the

more important capacities, ; but believing that
these suggestions were due more to the kind
ness of friendship than *>a knowledge of polit
ical probabilities I have not until recently given
them, very serious, thought. . -Recent happen
ings, however, 'convince ma that the desire that
I should serve the â¢ people ' of this State in a
high .official, position .is founded upon some
thing more widespread than the kindly ap
preciation of my friends. Communications so
numerous that I cannot' possibly reply to them

with precedent and custom, I desire to an
nounce in the columns of my home paper that
I shall go before the .Republican State con

If Mackenzie should ' lose in the May

placed in the anti-boss- column, as the
city of San Jose Is the acknowledged
stronghold of â¢ the gang. If Mackenzie
should: win by only a slender margin, the
county would be placed In the doubtful
class. It Is a fact of some political signi
ficance that San Jose and Vallejo are the
only cities of the State that hold munici
pal elections In the spring of each even
numbered year. San Francisco, Sacra
mento, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Stock
ton,' Berkeley, Eureka, Fresno, Oakland,
Napa â¢ and Pasadena elect In . odd-num
bered : years. The Los Angeles municipal
election is held in December of each even
numbered : year. 1 The bosses early in the
campaign saw the opportunity of making
the San Jose municipal election of 1902 a
"Gage straw,", and so began the work of
strengthening the machine in that city.
If the machine should lose in the prelim
inary skirmish. Gage would be dropped
out of the reckoning, because the State
administration has put forward its ut
most strength to fasten boss rule onthat
town.. : >- Â¦-Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ _Â¦Â¦Â¦ -Â¦ Â¦ â¢ - % .

marked:
;"If Johnny Mackenzie fails to
win out in the | San Jose municipal elec
tion in May, iVwlll be all oft with Gage.V
San Jose is regarded a,s the stronghold
of the bosses. The State patronage has
been freely used during the past two
years to strengthen the machine In that
city. More than a year ago the bosses
began to throw out hints that. the spring
election of San Jose in 1902 would be a
test of Gage's strength. There is now a
feeling of apprehension in the. boss camp
that Mackenzie -is over-confident," hence
the remark: "If Johnny loses, it will be
all off. with Gaee." ' "
The success of the Mackenzie organiza
tion in the May election at San Jose will
not place Santa Clara County in the Gage
column. The real battle for supremacy
will take place in August next, when
delegates to the State convention must be
chosen. Moreover, the districts of Santa
Clara County which are not embraced in
the corporate limits of San Jose will have
a voice in the selection of the county dele

Congressman Meekison Gives ' Peruna a
A Remarkable Experience of a Promi-
nent Statesman.
CONGRESSMAN MEEKISON OF OHIO.
â . Hon. David Meekison is well known, not only In his own State, but through-
out America. He began his political career by serving four consecutive terms
as v Mayor of the town in which he lives, during which time he became widely
known as the founder -of the Meekison Bank of Napoleon, Ohio. He was
elected to the Fifty-fifth Congress byVa very large majority, and is the acknowl-
edged leader of his party in his section of the State.
Only one flaw marred the -otherwise complete success of this rising states-
man. Catarrh with its insidious approach and tenacious grasp was his only
unconquered foe. For thirty years he waged unsuccessful Warfare against this
personal enemy. At last Peruna. came to the rescue, and he dictated the toW
lowing letter to Dr. Hartman as the result:

site selected for the World's Fair j in St.

of the, city and extends 'over, into the
County of St. Louis, outside the city. The
site includes the west half of Forest Park,

The members; of the. committee were all desirous
of being understood that this is something they, do
not need to do at' all, that .the treaties become the
supreme law of the land as soon as ratified by the
Senate, and that the concession does not Â¦ in" any; way"
impair the treaty-making power* of ; the -President and
Senate. To all this ; it may be said" that: if approval
by the House 'Â¦ does not affect . the ; constitutional val
idity of the treaty, to" withhold such -approval will
leave the treaty \ in force. ; For this reason it is : the
obvious duty of the interests to be traded off, arid in
jured : by- these treaties to continue opposition in the
Senate and; defeat them there if possible. " Otherwise
they, may find-it too late after Senatorial ratification,
for the" House v will be permitted a voice simply on the
principle of comity. V '
THE. Senate lately received a committee report
in favor of its supreme power in ratifying re
ciprocity treaties without any concurrence by
the House. This was to be expected. The two houses
are jealous of their constitutional 1 prerogative, and
neither was ever known to take a back. step. But :as
the Senate approaches action on the reciprocity trea
ties it gives signs of being content with a declara
tion 'of its primacy r.nd of intending' to soothe, the
House by a concession. The foreign Affairs Com
mittee proposes to. amend each treaty to provide that
it "shall take effect when approved 1 by. Congress."

/As 6ome of the pessimists contend that the im- ;
provements in the conditions of the masses have been
[attained by a sacrifice of capital, that industry is lan
guishing and trade decreasing, the optimists cite
financial returns to prove there has been a gain in
stead of a loss of British capital in recent years. It
appear^ from these statistics that the gross assess
ment for the income tax,. which in 1873 was $2,570,-'
000,000, increased to'. $3,970,000,000 in 1898-90, or by
$1,400,000,000 in twenty-five years, an average annual,
increment of more than. $55,000,000. /The â¢ estates
passing at death, which in 1873 had an aggregate
value of $645,000,000, ?mounted in 1900 to $1,460,000;
000. The total sum passing, through the bankers'
clearing-houses in 1873 was $30,910,000,000; in 1899
it was $45,750,000,000. The amount of .paid-up capi
tal in stock companies, which in /1884 was less than
$2,400,000,000, had become upward of $8,100,000,000,
an increase in sixteen years of $5,700,000,000.
Those figures. certainly show no evidence of decay
in either trade, commerce or finance. Other statis
tics show that since 1873 the capital invested in Brit
ish railways has - by upward of- $2,000^000,-,
cmy.TJie steam .tonnage i.qf, ,the kingdom was; 1,714,-
WHILE the majority of British orators and
writers are grumbling and growling: over
the j war or the decline of commerce and in-;
dustry, there is still a considerable number of optim
ists in the kingdom who contend that the people and.
the empire were 'on the whole never absolutely bet
ter off than they are now. It is conceded that the
growth of the United States and of Germany has
lowered Great Britain's comparative rank, but fig
ures are cited to show that she has grown and is
growing as well as her rivals, and is steadily improv
ing the condition of her people.
As an evidence' of the advancement of the British
masses toward a higher standard of life it is pointed '
out that they pay more rent, have more house room
to the family and eat more rreat.per capita than they
did thirty years ago. Other trade figures show that
the country spends more. annually for clothing than
in the past, and consequently the people must be bet
ter clothed than . they were in the preceding genera
tion. Finally, the educational system has been vastly
extended and improved. Municipal enterprises have
greatly- bettered , the conditions of the poorer quar
ters ~bf cities, while a similar advance has been made
in the improvement of rural dwellings. Being thus;
better housed, 'fed, clothed, educated and trained
than in former years, the average Britisher must be
much better off than his father. -/.

In making these charges against the bubonic
schemers the Mayor has not traveled beyond the rec
ord made public by the press at the time when .the
subject was one of dominant interest, and referred to
many, times since. The courts may find some
ground-tor denying the right of the Mayor to, make
the removal, but if so it will have to be sought, for
in a legal technicality, for certainly in the wrong
done to the community by the bubonic board there
is ample justification for the summary dismissal from
office. flSJga
That statement in itself would be sufficient justifi
cation for the removal of the four officials, but the
Mayor goes on to strengthen it by adding: "Yet
with full knowledge of all the facts' there continue
to be published and given to the world, up to the
present day, under your auspices and authority, re
peated announcements of its continued existence,
and constant reports of new discoveries and 'verifica
tions/ These reports, published in the prominent
medical and lay journals of the world, have done and
are doing our city and State untold damage. They
arc keeping from us a large number of desirable im
migrants and tourists: to a large extent they are
holding back the development of our industries and
interests through the influx of outside capital, and,
with the imaginative prophecies of future augmenta
tion in the number and virulence of the cases, they
arc seriously jeopardizing the future welfare of our
city."'
The Mayor's statement of the reasons and cause
for removing the four officials is terse and strong.
Referring to the reports of the board upon the al
leged bubonic plague cases he says: "Without desir
ing to cast any personal reflection, I find that where
the work of your bacteriologist has been supervised
the same results have not been obtained as when he
has acted alone. Out of thirteen 'suspected' cases
reported before April "8, ioor, and investigated under
your authority, six or seven were pronounced and
published by you as cases of true bubonic plague.
Out of 103 such cases examined between April 8,
1901; and August 27, 1901, under joint investigation
of your board and the State Board of Health, not
one authentic case of plague was discovered. Since
the last-named date, there being no further active
official participation by these physicians in the au
topsies, numerous cases are again reported and pub
lished as true bubonic plague cases."
MAYOR SCHMITZ'S latest movement in the
direction of ridding the city of the' pernicious
survivals of the Phelan administration by
dismissing four members of the notorious Bubonic
Board of Health has-ihe approval of the public cor
dially and well nigh universally given. This sweep of
the Mayor's broom rids the municipality of aset of
officials whose gross blundering â or worse â brought
upon San Francisco a degree of harm whose full ex
tent it is not possible to calculate. The dismissal
winds up a shameful story, and it is to be hoped that
with their departure from office the evil they did will
depart also, and that San Francisco hereafter will
have a clean reputation, so far, at least, as her free
dom from plagues and pestilences is .concerned.
The dismissed officials have sought out an. injunc
tionand will make a fight to retain office. By^doihg
so they serve no other useful purpose than that of
bringing to the test of the courts one of the dis
puted points of the new charter. Perhaps it is just as
well to have" the test made now* and in this way, for
it seems inevitable that every clause of the charter
will have to undergo judicial construction sooner or
later; but if the dismissed officials win, the victory
will avail them little. They were discredited long
before they were dismissed, and since they can ac
complish nothing in office and have not the confi
dence of the people, it would have been, wisdom on
their part to have retired at once, and left legal tech
nicalities to be tested by others.

FESTAL SANTA^ 0LARA.
It is announced that a company with a capital of
$80,000,000 has been organized in New York for the
purpose of handling nothing but corn, and. corn
products. The day when corn was used only for
bread or whisky is gone by. There are now more
than thirty commercial products made of corn and
used in such varied articles as beer, oil, sugar, rub
ber, mucilage, gum drops, wall paper, soap, , ink, 'salad
dressing, pipes and calico. In fact, corn comes very
near being the whole hog In more ways than one.\ ..
.Some arrangement^ should be made to give a re
sponsible officer charge and supervision over the por
ter. From the sleeping car there should be an alarni
system which would summon the conductor of '-the*
train at a moment's notice. It might even be,advis
able to require the company to employ women .to,
look after trie comfort of ladies in the sleeping cars.
Something; at any rate, should be done, for the right
of a woman to travel alone and to be fully protected
everywhere is not to be disputed. The Pullman Xar
Company is enormously rich. It can. well afford to
employ trustworthy officials and adequately protect
its cars. â It should be made to do "to.
Judging from the frequency of the reports of oft
fenses of one kind or another committed against
women in the Pullman cars it would seem that the
company exercises 4 little or no care in the selection
of the men to whose protection their passengers are
to be intrusted. Their one object appears to be to
get cheap men, or men who are willing to work for
what they can get out of the passengers in the way
of tips. Consider what must have been the reckless
ness of the company which would put in charge of a
car where women are asleep at night such a brute as
he who committed the outrage at La Junta.
The situation of a woman in a Pullman car at. night
is peculiar. The car is a traveling sleeping-room, to
which the porter has access at all hours. A simple
curtain separates him from the sleeping passenger.
Virtually the porter occupies the position of a man
in a woman's bedroom watching over her all night.
The temptations to ruffians to take advantage of un
protected women arc therefore many and strong.
Women have awakened in the night to find the-por
ter gazing at them. Sometimes they have awakened
to find him attempting to commit robbery. If when
such things occur the car be well filled and there are
men among the passengers the woman is in no dan
ger of anything further than a petty robbery, but if
she be alone the danger is .great.
Such gross crimes as that committed at La Junta
are infrequent, but lesser offenses committed by Pull
man car employes are cominon. Rarely does a week
pass without some report of a serious crime com
mitted or attempted in the sleeping cars; but these
do not by any means constitute the whole of the,of
fenses to which; women are subjected when trav
eling alone and exposed by some chance to the in
solence, of the porters. Most of the offenses, in fact,
arc never reported, as the women shrink trom the in
evitable notoriety' that would .follow.
It not infrequently happens that on the long
stretches across the desert there are times when
women are almost alone in the sleeping cars. On
some occasions many hours pass before new passen
gers enter, and 'during the f whole of that time the
lonely women have no protection whatever against
the car porter. The bell which is supposed to sum
mon assistance to any one who wishes it rings* not
for the conductor of the train, but for the car porter
himself. Consequently when he or any confederate
is engaged in the wrongdoing the ringing of the bell
calls no help whatever. The passenger is alone and
has no other defense than what she can make by her
unaided, efforts. Â¦<'."
B" Y "the atrocious outrage committed by a Pull
man car porter 1 at La Junta upon an aged
woman traveling alone public attention is
once, more directed to the dangers that, menace
women traveling without escort and relying' for pro
tection upon the officers and employes of the sleep
ing cars. It is a danger of such 'seriousness as to
merit something more than a passing notice, and it
is high time" some, authority were invoked to com
pel the Pullman Car Company to afford ample pro
tection where at present there is little or no protec
tion at all.

Fur-Bearing Animals Disappearing.
In the opinion of the Governor the
Alaskan "fur trade is doomed to extinc
tion. The sea otter and the fur seal ara
fast disappearing. The beaver has been
driven to the remote districts. The Arctlo
fox, the bear and the mink seem to be
the only fur-bearing animals -which, are
still found in considerable numbers in
Alaska. The enacting of a stringent game
law by Congress', In order to afford better
protection to the moose, caribou, deer and
other large game, is advocated.

No testimony tending to show that Gus
tavus L. Spear, the. 19-year-old son of
Mrs. Mary A. Spear, had committed 'sui
cide by gas asphyxiation in his mother's
home at 1729 Broadway was developed
yesterday at the Coroner's inquest. The
testimony taken was of the most common
place order. Nellie Gallagher, the young
woman . to whom the deceased was en
gaged, took the stand, dressed in deep
mourning, and gave her testimony with
out the least showing of emotion. 3
Mrs. . Laura L. Buffandeau, an aunt of
the deceased, was the first witness called,
and she reiterated the statements hereto
fore made. . Mrs.. Mary . A Spear. . tho
mother of the deceased, was too 111 to ap
pear in court, and in her deposition, read
by Coroner. Leland, said the only objec
tion she had to her son marrying was his
youth and inability to earn enough to Bup
port a wife. She advised him, she said,
to wait, and he took the . advice in good
part. /
Nellie Josephine Gallagher said she had
known young Spear for five years and
they had been engaged for two' years. She
saw him on the Tuesday preceding -his
death; but said that he never gave the
least intimation of committing suicide.
She. thought his death was due to acci
dent.
The following verdict was brought in
by the . Coroner's jury and signed by all
the members thereof:

Carlotta Quackenbush cannot secure
any of the property of Thomas Quacken
bush, the deceased capitalist, by decision
of the Supreme Court. The contest haa
been carried on In the courts for about
four years, but the dispute is now finally
settled. The suit was originally an ac
tion In equity to annul deeds to certain
property made by the capitalist to hla .
daughter, Esther E. Swortnguer.
The only point at issue wa3 whether
Carlotta was legally entitled to call her
last name Quackenbush. The lower court
decided that she was not. Her claim of
marriage to Quackenbush was based
principally on an allged contract which
was saH to have been written in Decem
ber, 1ST6. She said she lost the contract
for thirty-two years and at last found it
between the leaves of a. book of poetry.
That was after Quackenbush had died.'
The evidence showed that she had lived
with the deceased for about thirteen,
years. At the time she claimed to be the
wife of Quackenbush it was shown that
she was known as Mrs. Dawson.
/The Supreme Court holds that in view
of the conflicting- evidence, no action can
be taken toward reversing the decree of
the lower court. It is finally decided
therefore that the plaintiff was never the
wife of Thomas Quackenbush. '.-;;.

BAKERSFIELD, March 26.â The Alma
Oil Companv has filed suit in the Superior
Court against the county of . Kern and
Assessor Jameson .for the recovery of
taxes collected on an assessment of $78,000
levied by Jameson on the company's prop
erty In the Kern River fieid. The taxes
amounting tcr$132G, were paid under pro
test.' The decision in the case will mean
much to 'Kern County, (should the com
pany win in its effort to recover ' the
amount, the county may -be the loser of
many thousands of dollars, as the way
would be oaved for similar action on the
part of other comnanles.
The company, in its complaint, alleges
that the assessment was illegal, owing to
the fact that one-half of the land had
been prcviouBly transferred to other com
panies and that the Assessor could not In
any event assess land where the title
was still vested in the Government, the
Alma's tract being a United States min
eral claim.
Decision May Deprive Kern County of
Thousands of Dollars .in

LOS ANGELES, March 26.â A bit of gos
sip about a "combination" of the Southern
Pacific and the Santa Fe railroads to
down Henry. E. Huntington's electric rail
road companies, which has been the sub
ject of columns of speculation in certain
newspapers, was laid to rest this even-
Ing by Paul Morton, first vice president
of the. Santa Fe Company. Morton de
clared that there was nothing in the re
portânot even the suggestion of a com
bination between the two railroads tor
any such purpose.
'1 he story of the ! threatened war is
based upon a report that E. H. Harriman
of the Southern . Pacific and E. P. Rlpley
of the Santa Fe will hold a conference in
Los Angeles upon the arrival here of Mr.
Harriman. Whether- the two railroad
presidents. will meet here at all Mr. Mor
ton could not. say, but he was positive
that if a meeting were held it would not
be for the purpose of perfecting the ar
ticles of a declaration of war on Hunting
ton. Morton said:
"We are. entirely too busy right now to
give any attention to the affairs of the
Southern California electric railway com-
P&nies; and, indeed, there does not appear
10 be. anything in relation to the electric
roads i to demand -our attention. I do not
know, that Mr. , Rrpley- and Mr. Harriman
will meet in Los Angeles, but if they do
the meeting, probably Â¦ will not; be more
than a friendly one. I have never heard
a word .about any combination against
rfuntington's electric railways." k

HAD "Bill" Knapp, the sixty-two
pounder, been a tragedian instead
of a jockey, there is no;telling
show many curtain calls he.would
have received, judging, from his
reception from the crowd at Oakland yes
terday after capturing" the mile and three
furlong handicap with Frangible. Only a
few days back, the midget.rider landed
the same, horse first for a handicap at
odds of 25 to 1, beating Janice and others.
Watercure shouldered top weight, 118
pounds, yesterday an3 went to the post
a 3 to 5 favorite. Frangible carried 100
pounds, "and some few of the' books laid
11 to 1. KnapD went out. in front from
the start with his mount,'and although
Jackson moved up in plenty of time.with
the favorite, he could .not overhaul the
outsider, which" won, ridden out, by a
length. Position lost the show, to Liz
zella. The Fretter gave It up after dIs T
playing considerable early speed. .
. But Watercure was not the only favorite
to go down, for five othersâIshtar, John
Peters, Black Dick,. MacGyle and Head
waterâkept the Morris ' horse company.
The track was a trifle cuppy", which. In a
measure, .may have accounted for' the
downfall of some of them'. > ,
Willie Sink's Royalty, with Troxler up
and 4 to 1 in .the ring,: took the opening
sprint from Ishtar. The latter filly, a 6
to 2 favorite, looked all over a.winner at
one time In the stretch, but was" out
gamed :and beaten .half a length. . Vas
allo, a 15' to -1* shot, came from, the rear,
finishing a close. third.
John Peters, at 8 to 5, proved the next
choice to go by the beard.. He led from
the jump : in the six and a Â¦ half-furlong
run and was then collared the last 1U0
yards ,. and downed in- a hard. drive by
Colonial Girl, an 8 to. 1 chance. The win
ner, was weir ridden by .'Goodyear. Pat
Morrissey had all he could do in disposing
of Tufts for the show.; Bassenzo was left.
There.was a steadyvplay onCommis-'
sioner Forster at 'Â£% to 1 to annex the
mile selling affair andithe Schorr: colt
turned.up an easy winner. Jackson,, who
had ther mount, -passed Matilda O when
ready and at the wire. landed his. mount
nearly three lengths in 'front 'of Lena.
â¢Black Dick, piloted by Conley,* struck niP"
merous squalls, losing third place to Dean
Swift. Â¦ : . , . -:Â¦ ; - Â¦.

FttANK SHUGART is the man se- :

of the California Baseball League.
In Shugart Manager Harris has - landed
a. ballplayer of. the first water. Not only
is his work fast, but Tie. Is a splendid
manager, and considered 'one of the most

Shugart ; played with Charley "Comls
key's famous '.'White Stockings" last
year. His work In the field was fast, and
his batting . fully up to the average, al
though nothing extraordinary. He played
shortstop most of the time, but Js -also
a first-class third baseman. . -
Why Shugart did not- again sign with
one of the big league clubs is a question,
but at all events Harris must have made
him a splendid offer in order to lure him ;
away from the country's greatest, base- 1
ball center. Shugart will have. entire con

they are in the field, and the "fans" may
rest assured he will do as much; if not
more, than Pabst of last year's aggrega-

The fight was fairly even up to the twen
tieth round, with the advantage, if any,
with Thurston. He was very lively, on his
feet and most of Donovan's leads fell
short. In the last round both men went
at it hammer and tongs, trying fo- a
knockout. Thurston was tlie strcr.ger of
the two, however, and Donovan was get
ting a bad pummeling, when, just at the
end of the round. Donovan struck Thurs
ton a very low blow. The referee did not
consider the foul blow> an intentional one
and called the bout a. draw.
Martin Denny, one of Thurston's sec
onds, Jumijed Into the ring and began to
remonstrate with Donovan for striking
Thurston a foul blow. Donovan prompt
ly struck Denny and a lively mix-up was
averted by the police entering the ring
and putting an end to the row.
The preliminary between Frank Riley
of .Oakland apd MacDuff of Portland was
a fiasco. Riley was obviously the better
man and soon after the beginning of the
second round MacDuff. after claiming to
have been fouled, quit the contest. Riley
was given the decision.

The nrst. annual meeting will be- held in
Chicago June 12, 1902. President Eckhar.t
declared " the . federation was not , a com
bination for i the control of prices, but for
the purpose of furthering mutual interests

grown up during the past twenty years.

legislative- movements to' give the Inter
state Commerce' Commission authority to
enforce, Its rulings and. to correct the ac
tion of ocean steamship companies and

landing clause to prevent- the steamship
companies ' from discriminating against
American-vflour' was indorsed. Eckhart
explained that American flour had to pay
an unjustly high dockage rate at the
London; wharves. â¢. .
In' his address President Eckhart de
clared that the new federation should en
deavor to" extend the flour market by dip
lomatic commercial reciprocity treaties or

only used the Compound for a few

which I felt froin the very beginning.

"So. -with my former experience in mind.
I got fl\'e packages of Grape-Nuts and
eome packages of Postum "Coffee 'which,
with a little sugar and salt, were all the
supplies I took with me, and for nlny
days* laborious climbing over the rougb>
est country out of doors I had nothing
else except an occasional trout caught
from the stream. I came back feeling
first-class and am offering to bet that I
can average thirty miles a day over
mountain trails with thirty pounds of
blanketa.. etc.. on nothing but Grape-
Xute." Â¦Â¦MBMABMHBKfB
*'I had, a short time before, been proB-
pectlr.g with an old mountaineer in the
Bitter Root range in Montana. He was
an enthusiast on the subject of Grape-
JCuts and Postum Coffee. : In fact, hÂ»
lived on them.- I used to' 'Josh* htm
about his 'grub,' but soon grew to like
It myself, and finally got to eating Grape-
Nuts three times a day, and as much
oftener as I trot the chance.
. "I determined to have a look for it,
and, as the formation Is volcanic, it is
too Trough for pack animals. The problem
was how to carry food enough, in addi-
tion to my pick, pan and blanket, for a
lwo weeks' sojourn in the mountains.
Joseph Morehead, whose headquarters
are in Elgin, Ore., writes: "Last fall I
came down here, attracted by the rich
strikes in the Baker City fields. On my
arrival I heard a 'fairy story-' of 1 a 'lost

said to be fabulously rich in. coarse gold.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
Santa. Barbara leaking a few days ago. arrived
here yesterday in tow of the steamer Chehalis.
p^r^EIE steamship Alamcda arrived
I yesterday from Honolulu, after, a
S verj r stormy 'voyage. She encoun
Â¦ U. tcred head winds and heavy seas
from the beginning 1 of the trip un
til within a few hundred miles from port,
when a big beam sea made the going de
cidtdly uncomfortable.-
The Alameda brought a large number
of passengers, and, in spite of the opposi
tion of the elements,' made the trip in
tlx days, 21 hours.'
With this voyage the Alameda com
pletes ner hundredth round trip between
here and Honolulu and rounds out nine
teen years of as remarkable service as
car. be found recorded In the marine an
nals of any part of the world.
She was built in 1833 by William Cramp.
She has made sixty-eight voyages to Aus
tralia and a hundred trips to Honolulu,
and from the time of hor launching until
her last voyage to Australia she was
never once laid up for repairs. She made
her record trip at eighteen years of age,
and during the recejif phenomenally
stormy weather that has prevailed in the
N'crth ratific demonstrated that she has
lost none of her ability to take good care
of herself.
During her lifetime she has traveled
1.049,520 miles, and this without a break
down or any serious accident to her hull
or machinery. Her woodwork was re
built about a year ago and her deck and
cabin arrangements remodeled on strictly
up-to-date lines. In spite of all she has
accomplished, she is to-day virtually a
r-f-w boat and capable for years to coma
of maintaining her reputation as the most
successful shin afloat.
Captain Morse was the Alameda's first
commander. He was succeeded by Cap
tain Van Oterendorp, now master of the
Sonoma. Captain C F. Herriman, the
present commander, succeeded Van Oter
endorp.
The cabin passe.ngers who came up on
the A?ameda were:

Big Water Supply for Kauai.,
Among the freight dc-btincd for the Hawaiian
Islands In the hear future is the equipment for
an irrigation scheme of huge proportions. It
is a scheme which will involve the expenditure
cf more than fciOO.GOO and will increase thÂ«
water supply en the island of Kaual-by 50.0C0.
lÂ«m gallons daily. The present dally supply Is
ebout :JO.CCO,000 gallons, -which has been found
inadequate. The present supply is from the
HonapÂ«-i>e R;ver. The water is brought by
gravity a distance of thirteen and a half miles.
There are six siphon pipes and 7000 feet oi
forty-inch steel p.pe in the line of routs. This
Bnd the flume work involves a heavy outla>
tor iriainter.anee. The new supply is to bÂ«
brought trcm the'Mokaweli River and Its lins
of route runs through an almost inaccessible
canyon. Getting the new supply to Makawell
involve* tha construction of twenty-nine tun
pels within â¢ a distance of five miles. These
tunnels will be saven feet high and seven feet
wide tnd vary in length from S00 to 1800 feet.
SI. M. O'Shaughnessy of this city, who mad;
the survey tor the new route, leaves shortly
ror Honolulu, having been appointed consulting
casinecfof the wcrk of construction.

VICTORIA, B.C.; March 26.â A letter
received to-day by United States Consul
A. K. Smith from William Russ of.Skide
fate,: dated March 6, : gives news of thÂ«
finding of 'the name 'board .of the..bairk
Altavela, a 'Norwegian lumber carrier
which sailed from Hastings' Mills .with
956,449 feet of >. lumber, valued at : $7725, oh
February 8 ' and passed Neah ; Bay . two
days later, bound to Ostend. ' Â¦. â¢ ';
: Other wreckage, including; a, buoy from
the lest warship Condor, which had evi
dently ; drifted from the mouth of the.
Straits of Juan Fuca,' a piece of a 1 ship's
boat with the word "Nantes,'.' ; a white
painted larg^e gang plank and ,a.\ bottle
containing a hydrographic ; office "' blank
dropped from the ship Cardiganshire, now
bound for San Francisco from Â¦ Swansea,
was picked up. It was found on March
3 off Dead Tree Point, on the east side of
Graham Island, the most northern of- the
Queen .Charlotte group. .. â¢
Â¦ .While- the. finding, of .the -name "board
does not positively establish Uie fact- that
the: Altavela has met disaster,- it is well
known that on the 11th of February,. the
day after she passed" out, and on the
17th' of February, -two of the heavleat
southeast gales-of the - winter raged off
the coast, and the ships Gwydyr Castle,
Cavour, Bann and. others which passed in
1 some time afterward, .after having, been
buffeted for two weeks by the storms, re
ported narrow escapes from . destruction.
The Gwydyr Castle and Cavour were al
most driven on the west coast, the for
mer being within an Â¦ ace of disaster or.
the Scott Archipelago. It is possible that
the Altavela may. have been wrecked off
the northern coast and her name board
drifted with the other wreckage into He
cate Straits and cast on" the northern
island.
: With the wreckage found were two
cases of â¢ salmon which bore no marks
but were probably from the. overdue Red
Rock. The four cases found on Arlstaza
ble Island have been identified as similar
in every particular to, shipments made
by Findlay. Durham & Brodle on the
Red Rock and the Beechdale, which- left

NEW YORK. March 2C.*-To-day's stock
market was a very dull and professional af
fair. Colorado Fuel & Iron and Amalgamated
Copper absorbed between them a large propor
tion of the day's dealings from the ' opening
to the close. The first named ranged up to
2% over last night and the copper stock to 1%.
Colorado Fuel lost the greater part of- the gain
on realizing during the latter part of the day,
but Amalgamated Copper retained all but a
email fraction. Its subsidiary stock was also
firm at or above last night's price, notwith
standing the indefinite postponement from yes
terday of the Anaconda dividend meeting. The
demand was attributed to a Rhort interest,
which nought to take advantage of discouraging
newB to cover their short contracts. The stock
was not offered as freely as the bears had an
ticipated. There was no' new development in
Colorado Fuel and the large transactions in
the stock werÂ«,by the same brokers as those
recently active in It. The preferred made an
opening jump of C points, relapsed 7 and ral
lied 4. Tennessee Coal was firm in sympathy,
but the other active stocks were neglected and
heavy. American Telephone rose 4 and North
American rallied 3 over last night. -Minne
apolis. St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie was at
one time up 4 points. There was some firmness
In one or two of the prominent railroad stocks,
but the tendency of the general* list was lower.
The factors influencing ".the unarket .were'prac
tloally the same as '-those of â¢-. yesterday..'. The
threat of-a- strike by the anthractte miners was
a one. :- The- Coalers, themselves ks
a rule were only slightly affected by the labor
situation, but Lackawanna made a violent
break o* 44. The coming adjournment of -the
exchange from Thursday to Monday had the
usual effect of causing a -closing up of con
tracts. ' There is some fear that the demand In
the loan market to Carry over the stocks from
Thursday until Monday will 'cause a flurry in
call loan rates to-morrow. There is a possi
bility also that a poor. bank statement will be
published in the . Interim. The possible break
ing off of negotiations for peace In South Afri
ca/before trading is resumed was taken account
of .as well as the apparent approach of .the end
of. the career of Cecil Rhodes, which was in
fact reported on the exchange late in the day.
The market closed easy.
There iras a yielding tendency to the prices
o* bonds in sympathy with stocks. Total sales,
par value. $2,500,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. - Â¦ . ' .

f "Our foreign commerce returns deserve win?
attention as they show a continued change in
the drift cf our fOTelsti trade, and a partial
cessation of the enormous trade balances which
have been a feature for several years. In Feb
ruary our export* were only ?101 .500.000. cr
$11,400,000 Icrr than & year ago and $18,000,000
less than In 1899. They were the smallest in
any month since July. 1S99. The decline was
chiefly due to licht corn shipments and a de
crease in iron and eteel exports. A short crop
explain* the loss In corn; but the shrinkage In
rteel products is due to the great demand at
home and low prices and depression abroad.
The 'American invasion' of the European steel
markets Is less threatening than a year or so
ago especially as our British and European
rivals are preparing to lower their cost of pro
duction to meet American competition, our
Import? of merchandise are aÂ» steadily rialni?

acainst *4fc. 400.00) last year There la nothing
In thin return of foreign trade movements to a
more normal condition to cause the slightest
concern; but the big favorable trade balances,
so ofun used es bull arrumenta, will be lack-
Ing this spring."
"Beyond a quiet, and somewhat firmer un
dertone there Is little change in the finan
cial situation. In certain respects the outlook
appears to be somewhat brighter, and a more
confident undertone prevails than two or three
weeks ago. This appears to be entirely due to
Fatisfactory trade conditions. Prom various
quarters come reports of heavy distribution of
nearly all classes of merchandise; consumption
epi>ears to continue with unabated activity, and
the expectation generally seems to be that the
country v.-ill enjoy a good spring trade. The
imjxjrtant manufacturing: 'Industries are all
fully enijdoyed and the chief difficulty appears
to be the filling of orders with sufficient
promptness to eatlsfy buyers. This Is espe
cially true of the various branches of the irpn
and textile trades. The activity In the freight
department* of the railroads is further proof
of the good condition of general business, " the
westbound traffic being particularly large for
the season. In consequence railroad earnings
are maintained at high level, surpassing even |
the large increases of the last two years Such
decreases as have appeared ran usually be at- i
irifcuted to last year's crop failures, which have
only recently been felt, and even then in a far
less decree than anticipated, because of the
pressure of other traffic. We have thus seen
an unexampled and totally unexpected con
tinuance of Industrial and railroad prosperity
which apparently has not yet run Its course.
The outlook for the railroads, therefore, is per
fectly Fatlsfactory. Large sums have been
epent out of earnings during the past two years
for improvements and renewals, and expenses
on there . accounts should soon diminish.
Whether any further Increases in dividends are
to follow . or not in consequence trill depend
chiefly upon a continuance of present large
earnings. Unfortunately railroad prosperity
has been very largely discounted in advance and
values have been unduly raised through contest
for control; so these conditions cannot be ex
pected to have the same stimulating effect upon
prices which would be the case were the mar
ket situation less artificial. Nevertheless with
railroads and industrial affairs in such good
shape the market has a substratum of strength
which cannot be overlooked.
"Speculative operations are still held in check
by absenteeism and the low condition of the
bank .'reserves.' Very .coon the financial leaders
who have been South or elsewhere recuperating
Â¦will begin to return, and in April the money
rnarktt will be less exposed to stringency than
now. It is quite possible that next month some
concerted effort will be made to Infuse fresh
activity into the market if nothing Intervenes;
it being an open secret that the big holders are
necessarily enlisted on the bull side of the
market. Whether the- public will be tempted
to re-enter or not. it is Impossible to predict;
the inducements ere not very great, and there
is not the material for any extensive bull cam
paign, though It is quite within the realm of
possibilities to create a better trading market.
Much will depend upon crop reports. The crop
situation as a whole next 6easoa Is hardly like
ly to be worse than last year's with Its small
yield of corn and cctton. Simply average crops
this rear would save the market from setbacks
on that score. The weakest element of the
situation is the fact that the financial leaders
are carrying heavy lines of stocks bought at
high prices, which they would like to Eell. and
the marketing of which taainly depends upon
their various concentration schemes that havÂ«
been seriously checked by legal lnterferencs,
notably In the Northern Pacific merger pro
ceedings. Fortunately there Is no question
whatever about the ability of these gentle
men to carry the burden which they have un
dertaken, but they are getting little help from
thÂ«? public. â¢ ' .

WE have for sale rights for the States of Cal-
ifornia. Oregon and Washington for the best
locked-wire fence device ever patented. The
owner of the patent is a practical ranch man
who has 200 miles of barbwlre fence in the
Panhandle, and who Is now going over the
entire fence system of his ranch, putting in
the stays with this locked-fence device. The
device has taken like wildfire In the Eastern
States. . The State of Iowa alone sold .for
$10,000. We have samples of the device at
our office, where it can be seen. The prin-
cipal advantaue of this fence device is that
it makes a fence that is almost indestruct-
ible; no power can move the stays when put
on with our patent fastener and patent
wrench. If this device were adopted in Cali-
fornia it certainly Would revolutionize fenc-
ing. The fence is cattle-proof, and by put-
ting In enough stays you can fence against
the smallest animals. The device can be used
on ornamental fences' or for office wire work.
"* The wrench and clips and possibly some
models of the fence can be seen at the City
Wire Works, on Main St., between Seventh
and Eighth. Mr. Blescar, the proprietor,
will be glad to explain Its use. MINING IN-

when I was certain of my ground I acted. The
new Board of Health Is the legal body. The
members met and formally organised and will
transact its business. - The old board may. meet
In the meanwhile, but any action it may take
will be clearly Illegal- I have no fear of tho
result. The -people are with- me and that Is
sufficient to justify, mycourse.

reviewed by the courts. ? A sweeping In
junction was Issued: by Judge Cook early
yesterday morrtlnff' restraining; the new
appointees , from performing tho duties of
their office or, from in any way interfering
with the health employes until the legality
of Mayor, Schmltz's act has been Judicial
ly determined. . . ' , .
The city stand* In the anomalous posi
tion of having .'two Boards of Health in
office. Under the/ injunction, the old
board will continue to do business at the
old stand until /the issue raised has been
adjudicated.,'. The!" members' of the new
board, relying upon * the advice of their
attorneys, insist' upon , their /{right'' to
servo tho city, and 'they state' their inten
tion to begin the immediate discharge of
their j official duties. They claim that the
power ,' of the Mayor to remove the old
board Is unquestioned, except by the per
sons at Interest, and that the courts will
so decido when tho injunction proceedings
arc heard, â¢
'The 'application for an injunction/ was
prepared by Attorneys McEnerney and
Gavin , McNab on the complaint of Dr.
Vincent P.- Buckley, a member of the de
posed board.- It was brought against the
Mayor, his attorney, 'A. Ruef, and DnÂ».
James M. -Ward, T. A. Rottanzl, J. C.
Htlnson, M. K.Van Meter und A. 8. Adlcr.
After reciting: the action of the Mayorsln
removing the members of the' Board, of
Health, tho pliiinti re asserts that the
charge upon which the action was bas3d,
namely, that the plaintiffs caused rumors
to be circulated that there existed bubonic
plague, In this city V in March, 1900, wu.8
untrue. It. was further alleged that the
plaintiffs were removed from office' with
out notice that the said charges were be
ing investigated, and without being given
an opportunity to present testimony In
controverslon of "the* charges. Another
point made was 'that' the new members
were appointed, without. due notice being
given the plaintiff. .

have made a combination for the purpose
of protecting themselves.
. In his Inaugural message Mayor Schmltz
recommended that the bond of the Cltv
Treasurer be increased to $203,000. whir-h
would make McDougald's premium $2000.
or Just half of his annual salary. The
Mayor, however, recommended that the
city pay the additional $1000. A similar
recommendation was made in regard to
increasing the Tax Collector's bond from
$50,000 to $100,000.
McDougald argued that as the city Im
posed the bond it should pay the prein
.lum, the same as is done by large busi
ness houses who bond their employes
After a long discussion It was decided
that Mayor Schmltz formulate a request
to the City Attorney asking for his opin
ion as to whether an appropriation may
be made In the tax budget to pay the
premiums on the bonds.

Psycho, the musical mystery, will again appear in Sher-
, man, Clay & Co.'s windows this afternoon at three o'clock
and this evening at half-past seven. : The exhibition will con-
tinue in the windows up to \ Saturday afternoon.
On Saturday evening the expose of Psycho will take
place at an ANGELUS Piano Player recital in Sherman-
Clay Hall. Tickets to the expose free to- adults only by ap-
plying to Sherman, Clay &"Co.
As several rumors are afloat that Psycho is a man one
day and an automaton the next, that a" human being has been
exhibited so far, but an automaton will appear at the expose,
and vice versa, Shermai, Clay & Co. desire to state that the
same figure which has been seen by so many in the window
will be the one appearing at the expose.
