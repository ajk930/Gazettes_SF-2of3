VICTORIA, B. C, /April ..16.-r According
to news from Melbourne, by the Austra

sensation in' the Australian Senate on
March 22, when Senator P. H. Iliggs,
amid loud interruptions, -made an' appeal*
for the! Boers and.decried the sending of
another contingent to, South Africa. He
complimented the Boers on their â¢ splen

The principal speech of the evening was
made by Dr. Nicholas Senn, who replied
to the toast, "Holland as a â¢ Power of
Civilization." He said .the, Boers had

Patterson also defended the section In
the Mitchell bill excluding Chinese from
American ships,' declaring that it is es
sential to the protection of American la

provision meant, he said, that it was in
tended to subsidize the ships and then
allow ;their owners to go into the cheap
est markets to secure labor, leaving the
American seamen to , their fate. The ef
fect would be -to drive American sailors
from the American ships, which would be
contrary to the policy of the American
people, who want . American ships under
the American flag and manned by Ameri
can sailors. As- for the flag, it was a
mere piece of cloth, its only significance
being attached. to what it stood for. If it
was .to be raised at the . masthead of

to the real inhabitants of the islands or
to the honor of . the United States. He
quoted with approbation the report of
General McArthur, and said that tho pro
posed legislation is equivalent to a notice
that the policy of exclusion is looked
upon'wlth disfavor and he could not con
ceive a more indefensible act than during
the formative period In the Philippines to
flood that country with a people whom

There is good reason t^ believe that the
Boers are vigorously demanding a repre
sentative government and that this de
aiand Is opposed with equal vigor by the
British representatives. It is understood
that the Boers strongly oppose the long

representative government be granted the
Tormer republics, and that they also in

The Government has ordered the cable
md telegraph lines between London and
Pretoria to be kept clear to insure the
prompt transmission of Lord Kitchener's
messages.
The broad lines of Great Britain's
terms are now known to the Government
representatives at Pretoria, and on these
reports the Cabinet is apparently shift
ing the responsibility of taking advan-
Lage of all opportunities, provided no
cardinal principles be sacrificed.
"Sparring for time" best describes th.Â»
present status of the negotiations,
neither side being willing to risk a de
rision which would break off the pres
ent conference. An agreement may be
reached at any moment, but this would
more likely be the/result of semi-lnde
(xin&ezit action by Lord Milner and Lord
Kitchener at Pretoria than of the rather
involved conditions of the Cabinet at

MANILA, April 16.â General Malvar
has unconditionally surrendered to Brigr
adier General Bell at Lipa, Batangas
province, with the entire insurgent force
of the provinces, of Laguna and Batan
gas. General Bell says his (Bell's) in
fluence Â»is sufficient to. quell the insurrec
tionary, movements . in Â¦ Tayabas and-
Cavlte provinces and capture all those In
the field who have not yet surrendered,
but Malvar has ordered the complete sur
render of every insurgent to the nearest
American force. General Wheaton,: re

pays that all resistance in his department

little attention at the time.- The letter
was written by Colonel Dickman from
the Presidio. San Francisco. ! April 24,
1301. He had been directed to investi
gate Sergeant Rlley's charges that the
water cure was administered at Igbaras.
a fact which he testified to before the
Senate committee last Monday. : Colonel
Dickman made this return in part to the
War Department: â¢ â¢
Generaj Chaffee states that it is his be
lief that a large majority of the Dat
tos will not- support 1 those implicated in
the murder of American soldiers, but the
minority may be powerful for all the
department knows, and by reason of the
Mahommedan religion which binds all
the people of this tribe together may In
duce many of those still friendly to join
in a religious-- war. against the ..United
States.
It was admitted at the. department-that,
General Chaffee informed Secretary Root
three weeks ago in relation to : the atti
tude adopted by the- Mores,. but it was de
cided" to i keep , the. .news,, secret,- In - ; ~the
hope that General Chaffee by,a,pereqriai
visit to Mindanao would be able to ef
fect a settlement .of the trouble. : Having,
failed to reach an agreement with the
Moros and military operations being
necessary, the department decided thac
It would be unwise to further conceal the
facts, and the message from- General
Chaffee was therefore given to the press.
The Moros have a reputation- of being
warlike, bold and rapacious. The Philip
pine Commission in its annual reports ur
gently recommended Â¦Â¦ that measures be l
tatten to conciliate them, apprehending
that if any friction occurred a prolonged
and fierce war would ensue. Fighting has
occurred with the American troops on the
north coast of Mindanao. v-
The War. Department stated that tit
would be unnecessary to send additional
troops to the Philippines to take the
place of those which were ordered' frotai
Luzon to " Mindanao. General Chaffee
has been given no instructions, but will
order as large a force to the scene of
the new difficulty as he may consider de-'
Srlrable. *j Colonel Baldwin, who is In
command of the expedition -which will
start for Lake Lanao, will, under in
structions given him, endeavor to pre
vent trouble with the Dattos . who are
not involved in the dispute* with 'the*
Americans. â¢ , >- Â¦ . Â¦Â¦>, .. ; ;
News Was Kept Secret:
Parang-Parang is an anchorage in Pol
loc harbor, on the west coast of the main
land of Mindanao. Malabang- lies about
twenty miles north on the coast,- and is
connected by a military cable. Lake La
nao is situated about twenty-five miles
northwest of Malabang.
An expedition of ' 1200 men, under â¢ Colonel
Frank D. Baldwin, cavalry and artillery, P is'
being formed to leave for Lake Lanao about
April. 27 for the purpose of arresting the mur
derers and to punish the Danes. Every care - is - :
to be taken not to bring. on. a general war with
the Meros about the lake. It is absolutely im- .
portant that our authority should be respected
by the people and that the sovereignty of the
Dotted States should be fully acknowledged. I
have addressed a letter to this effect to the I
Dattos, at the same time informing them of
the friendly disposition of our Government; j
that the purpose was to punish only those giv-,;
Ing offense; that the Government claims - the â¢
right to explore the country between' Illana I
and Ilimar bays; that it is my purpose to do so
now and at any other time. For the accom
plishment of this object .it is necessary to re
tain a battalion of the Seventeenth two months
longer. My belief is that the large majority
of Dattos will not support those implicated in
the murders. â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ . - â
Expedition Being Formed.
With reference to my telegram of , the .23d"
ult.,- reporting an attack by Moros on -a recoji 7[
noiasance under Forsythe. .March 14, a soldier
of the Twenty-seventh Regiment, United State-
Infantry, was murdered by Moros In the vicln- â¢
ity of Parang-Parang.- March 30 two soldiers"
of the Twenty-seventh "Regiment, United States:'
Infantry, having one gun, were approached .,
with a semblance of friendship" by, six Moros^ |
near Malsbang. The rifle was seized, one sol-':
dier was killed and the other was severely '
wounded, but escaped.. The murder was wHh- ,
out provocation or justification in any f way. j
l*he murderers are known and a demand has
been made for their surrender. Thus' far the'
Dattos have refused to deliver them., I have
been to Malanga and tried to confer with them. .
The Dattos failed to come' or acknowledge .re
ceipt of my request for a conference.
This action "of General Chaffee was
taken after ,tie ; himself,, had , gone from
Manila to Zamboanga for. the purpose. of
endeavoring to peaceably, arrange the dif
ferences between'' the Americans; and the'
Moros. The cause of the .troubled the ne

The- glass works at Courcelles were
practically destroyed â¢ by fire last night.
It is estimated that the damage will
amount to 600,000 francs. It Is believed
the -fire was started by an incendiary.
Disturbances were reported from various
parts of the country to-day. Small bombs
were : exploded at Liege Â¦ and - elsewhere.
A bottle filled with i gunpowder was ex
ploded at' the door of a residence and at
the glass ' works at Mariemontj near La

done by the explosion of the bombs. -At
Renaix an earthenware jar, with a fuse
attached to; it,- was discovered on the

in three taverns, , which were wrecked. Â¦
Strikers Cause Damage.
The, promised great demonstration in
the | streets on tne adjournment of the
Chamber dwindled to the appearance of
200 persons, who accompanied the Social
ist Deputies to the office of their organ,
Le Peuple, where Van der Velde from a
window addressed the crowd. He said
the day's proceedings in the Chamber had
'.not; modified the situation and that the
Government was still recalcitrant and
had shifted the responsibility for a disso
lution of Parliament, which the revision
ists would demand if the Chamber rejects
the proposal to revise the constitution,
on the King, who thus far had been si
lent. A feeling is gaining ground that the
Government will entirely reject the pro
posed revision of the. constitution.
. The number of strikers in the chief In
dustrial centers are estimated as follows:
At Charleroi, 50,000; in the central district,
25,000; at Borinage, 25,000; at Liege, 30,000.
and at Verviers, 8000. Later In the day
large accessions to the ranks of the strik-.
Â¦Â¦*rs at Charleroi brought the total in that
district to 60,000. . .
Government Is Recalcitrant.
After the speech of .Beernaert and : a
speech delivered by Feron, : Progressist,
which monopolized the "entire session and
fell j very flat, . the opening day of . the
great debate on the proposed" revision -of
the constitution ended in what.was,al
most a fiasco.
BRUSSELS. April. 16.--The | diplomatic,
private and public galleries in the Cham
ber of Representative^ were filled' to their
capacity to-day when r the debate on the
proposed revision of the" constitution be
gan. Beernaert, the Â¦: former president of
the, Chamber â¢ and "'Secretary of State,
opened the discussion. He .was frequent
ly interrupted by Van der Vfeide >T the-So
cialist leader, with shouts of 'â¢Universal
suffrage is supreme." ... â . +. + '*>,â
Beernaert expressed the belief, that the
present Belgian electoral system,was.sat
isfactory. He referred to the numerous
social laws passed during the last-fifteen
years at the behest of â¢ the .Socialists, an<i
said the latter's: solt 'recognition 6V ttle
passage of these laws was the declaration
of a general strike, :.. accompanied' - by
threats of violence. Â¦ ' * â¢Â¦Â¦' ''Â¦Â»
Three Hundred Thousand Men

If the bill should ever .reach a vote
there is no doubt whatever that it will
pass the Senate. \ The discussion of the
bill as a regular order will not be reached
unt41 after the ' Philippine civil govern
ment bill has been disposed of. Whether
the Cuban reciprocity bill or the Hepburn
bill will then have the right of way rests
with the Senate's Committee on Order of
Business.
Undoubtedly the opponents "of Nlcara
guavhave not; abandoned their efforts to
defer -.legislation, at this session. Their
original plan was to postpone all discus
sion of th'e question, just as they did at
the [ last â¢ session after the Hepburn bill
had passed the House. This time they
have been compelled to yield to the senti
ment of the Senate and consent to a dis
cussion of the bill. Only in -this way have
they been able to prevent an- open revolt,
which would long ago have smashed
party lines.
Many of the Republicans in the Senate
who would like to postpone this question
are hesitating because they realize that
there is a tremendous sentiment in favor
of- the, Hepburn measure North, South,
East aJid West, and are convinced that
inaction at this . time means a perilous
defiance of the will of, the voters.

READ THIS OFFER.
ACCEPT IT TO-DAY.
I have a message to every suffering
and health- broken man in this country.
If you are afflicted with Sexual Weak-
ness or, Nervous Debility. I want you
to read this article and then write to
me. I have a medicine with which I
have cured hundreds of my friends and
others who have written me for it. I
am not a doctor or a sharper, but a
plain business man, and I want every
weak, disappointed and debilitated man
to write to me for a copy of the for-
mula from which this wonderful medi-
cine is prepared. I do not ask you for
money. It is free.
Read the following, by William Cole,
M. D.. Washington, D. C, published in
the United States Investigating Re-
ports, regarding the prescription from
which this remedy for curing Lost
Manhood is prepared:
During the examination of men for the army
during our recent war with Spain, our United'
btates army physicians were shocked to find
a j large a percentage of men disqualified be-
uause of neri-ous disorders. It is not the pur-
. puse of these reports to enter Into a statement
of causes, other than to fcay that the sufferer
is fcoldom to blame. His condition Is Indeed
deplorable; his memory tails him. his energy
gone, his eyesight dimmed, his muscles sort
und his nervous stamina gone. Hs is pitied
by tiices versed in nervous disorders and re-
jjelled fcjf those of both sexes who do not un-
derstand how dark the world is to him.
Some fifteen years ago the writer gave atten-
tion to the ctre of nervous disorders and
iound that the late Dr. Wilson. Professor ot
Chemistry and Practitioner of Medicine in Bel-
levue Medical College of New York, had a
formula of wonderful power to restore to men
Â¦ the fullnees of â¢ their physical and mental
strersth. In the year Itasz the celebrated Dr.
\\ ilson died and his formula has been obtained
by L. F. Page of 201 State street, Marshall,
Mkliirnn, who prepares it according to tho
original prescription, and lronr our analysis of
the same, by our Lirard of Investigation, we
find it composed of pure and freeh drugs, and
that it is sold under the name of "Pr. Wil-
son's Restorative Remedies." Our investigation
was extended into a great number of similar
preparations, none of which were found equal
to the above, while many were prepared by
those who knew HtUe.Â«r- nothing'about- thera-
peutics cr.materiatnedica. -We hereby cautioc
the public azainst the vsÂ» of all- unoertahi
remedies and all whe need nerye-llfe -bringing
medicine we recommend them to tike Dt. Wil-
son's Restorative Remedies, prepared and sold
by â¢ L. F. Page, 201 \ State street, Marshall,
Michigan, and , onto thÂ« aforesaid Dr. Wilson'K
Restorative -JJemedies we., extend xhe^ official
indorssraent'trf the United States Investigating
Reports. ; g~Â£ %
To every one who writes in good faith
I will send the full formula of this
wonderful medicine. This prescription
and full directions are sent free. Have
It filled, or if you desire, you can buy
the remedies and prepare it privately
just as well yourself. One prescription
will make a new man of you. One dose
will be enough to convince you of its
marvelous power.
Among those whose attention has
been attracted by this magnanimous
offer is the Rev. J. S. B. Crawford of
Waynesville, N. C, a very prominent
divine, whose own vitality was serious-
ly Impaired. Being sick of paying
money to quacks and charlatans, who
took his money without doing him any
good, Mr. Crawford had the prescrip-
tion made up and took it regularly, as
he was directed. With this result, he
was perfectly cured, and after several
years of enjoyment of his newly given
powers, made the statement publicly
that every man in need of help should
do likewise.
There are not many ministers who
would.be willing to publicly, indorse
and recommend a cure of this kind,
with the statement that they them-
selves had been cured by it, but the
Rev. Crawford has in him a great
deal of true gratitude and love of man-
kind. This is shown in a recent letter
in which he says that he makes public
acknowledgment "in order that others
may receive the same happy results."
You are older now and can look back
and see the mistakes you . have made,
but you cannot recall the vigor "and fire
. of the springtime of robust manhood.
Your transgressions have left their
mark upon you. Your errors and .ex-
cesses have ravaged your system and
undermined your nerve force. Quick-
ness, backache, nervousness and debil-
itating drains and worn-out, shrunken
and lifeless organs are making your
life a miserable existence, devoid \ of
pleasure. You hesitate and falter; you
are not the man you once were, and
you know it. Cast aside your modesty.
This. matter is too important. Act at
once with manly decision.
This formula is printed and costs me
almost nothing, and I give it free of
any charge. I do not ask it, but -if you
desire to do so, you can pay something
after using it. I want to help- every
suffering: man in America to regain his
health and strength and the ability to
enjoy the pleasures of life as I do. ? :Ad-

Fairbanks closed before 1 o'clock, the
time set fof voting to begin, and Lodpe
asked for a vote on his amendment strik-
Fairbanks of Indiana said there had not
been a disposition on the part of the op
ponents of the bill to point out' its de
merits and propose amendments,' as much
as to tear down the entire measure that
has been constructed with so much care.
Continuing, he said, he did not believe
that the laboring men of the United
States would threaten -Senators in this
way If their judgment waa not entirely
in accord with their own on any. given
subject. He maintained that Senators
had a perfect right to vote their judg
ment without it being charged that their
votes were influenced by dollars or biased
by politics.
"J am sorry." he said, . "that Senator
Lodge has such an unfavorable opinion
of the working-men of this country, and
as a friend of that class I resent th.s
characterization of their motives."
Hanna referred to the address of Lodge
on this bill, quoting the statement of the
latter to the effect that the omission of
the Chinese exclusion legislation would
be resented at the polls by the working
classes. "HITTa ifAnTiiujTri - .
He then went on to say that both
former Secretary Gage- and former As
sistant Secretary Vanderlip had assured
him they never had advised with Dunn
concerning the bill, and that neither of
them would consider his advice worth
having. Furthermore, he said, the pres
ent Secretary had assured him that he
was not in accord with all parts of the
pending bill. It was also true that the
Secretary of State ne\-er had been con
sulted with reference to the bill, knowing
the treaty with China la involved, and
regardless of the fact that a new com
mercial treaty between the United States
and China is now under consideration by
the representatives of the two countries.
ADVICE NOT SOUGHT.
Hanna then turned his attention to the
connection of J. R. Dunn, Chinese in
epector, with the bill. He read a letter
from Secretary Shaw explaining that
Dunn had been summoned to Washington
last November to give advice In connec
tion with the framing of the proposed
Chinese legislation, and saying that
Dunn's connection with the legislation
was merely advisory In character. Hav
ing laid this foundation for his statement,
Hanna created some surprise by saying
abruptly that "knowing this man as 1 do,
I here state that Mr. Dunn is an unre
liable witness and adviser." He tnen took
up some of Dunn's statements to the
Committee on Immigration, saying that
they merely reflected the character of the
man. He referred to a statement made
by Dunn to the effect that be had been
Importuned to accept his position, and in
timating, Hanna eaid, tnat this impor
tuning had come from President McKin
ley because he had lived In the Presi
dent's town. "If that be bo.", he ex
claimed, "I demand that he produce the
letter."
"Demand and insist upon your support
ing every essential feature of the Chinese
txclusion bill."
This telegTam was, he said, so similar
to all the others received by him that he
had concluded all of them had a common
origin. Whether this was true or not he
reservedv he said, the right' to determine
for himself what were the essential
features of the legislation necessary for
the exclusion of the Chinese and be had
reached the conclusion that all those?
features were embodied in the -existing
law which it was proposed to re-enact by
the Platt amendment and the additions
to them which had been suggested, lie
felt confident that with .the amendments
suggested the interests of the working
men would be abundantly protected.
Hanna was the next speaker. He salil
that he had not intended to ' address . the
Senate on the subject, but that in view
of the fact that he- had received numer
ous telegrams expressing an anxiety to
know wnere he stood with reference to
the bill, he had changed his mind, be
lieving, he said laughingly, that he would
eave postage and telegraph tolls by mak
ing a public address. He then read the
text of one of the messages which _e had
received, which said: .. . '-

Th'e Platt amendment to the- 'Chines*
exclusion measure Is a substitute for thl
entire bill. A3'it-has been" changed and
voted upon. the amendment reads:
FLATT?S SUBSTITUTE.
Lodge of Massachusetts secured an
agreement making the Philippines civil
government bill the unfinished business
of the iSenate, and after a brief 'execu
tive session the: Senate at 6'o'clock ad
journed. >:. Â¦ .
The/substitute was further perfected
by an amendment, proposed by Mitchell
providing the -Judicial procedure in exclu
sion, cases in - our Insular possessions.
Before the final vote was taken on the
passage of the substitute bill Hoar gave
notice that he would: vote against the
measure, and In this connection he made
earnest protest against" the principle of
exclusion. He believed* that everything
In the way of exclusion coukl be accom
plished without Involving : the principle
of striking at a particular class or race
Holding as he did that every soul had Its
lights, and that these rights were not
dependent on color or -race, he recorded
b's protest against the measure
The bill was then passed, 76 to 1 Hoar

the negative. -\ -

The decisive vote was then taken on
the substitute proposed by Platt of Con
necticut extending the present exclusion
laws, and this prevailed, 48 > to 33, as fol
lows: ,
HOAR'S DISSENTING VOTE.
Patterson withdrew his amendment, be
ing satisfied that the substitute already
covered the Philippines.
Mitchell of Oregon offered as an amen,d
ment to the substitute several sections of
the original bill .providing for taking out
Chinese certificates in our insular posses
sions, and amendments for. that. purpose,
were unexpectedly carried by the close
vote of 41 to 40. The amendment Incor
porates section 12 the original bill as a
part of the substitute and provides the
methods by which .Chinese residing in the
insular territory 'of the 'United States
(Hawaii excepted) shall take out certifi
cates of Identification, etc. '
provisions of the substitute should not
apply to Chinese coming to participate in
expositions, etc., was adopted.
Patterson moved an amendment to. the
substitute, deslgneu to apply the exclusion
provisions to the Philippines.
Lodge pointed out that the substitute
already applied the same protection to
the Philippines as to the mainland terri
tory of the United States.
â¢ Platt;-of -Connecticut then offered his
substitute extending the: present law. He
said the United States was committed, to
the policy of exclusion and any sugges
tion ' that Senators opposing the bill were
seeking to break down. the exclusion pol
icy was gratuitous and without'founda
tion, but the, pending bill was unnecessary,
it was offensive to China at a time when
we sought her good will and it improp
erly enacted treaty regulations as law. .
An amendment by Mallory adding to the
Platt substitute the sailors' clause, was
defeatedâ 29 to 50.
An amendment by Cockrell â¢ that ' the
That part of Quay's amendment'admit
ting Chinese Christians was lost without
division, and on- an. aye and no vote the
admission of Chinese soldiers who assist
ed Americans during the siege of Peking
was defeatedâ 7 to 68. Those who voted
for the amendments were Burton. Dolli
ver, Hoar, Platt of New York, Proctor,
Quay and Vest. . . >. â¢
Dolliver of Iowa referred in glowing
terms to the heroism of Minister and Mrs.
Conger, residents of Iowa, during the
siege of Peking, and he expressed the be
lief that some adequate recognition should
be given by this Government to those who
aided the: American legationers during
those days of peril.
HEROISM OF THE CONGERS.
Several Senators spoke against the
amendment on the ground that It would
lead to evasion of the law. ' â¢ -
Carmack of Tennessee proposed an
amendment applying . the exclusion to
Chinese- "not citizens of the United
States," and it was agreed to. The pur
pose of the amendment is to allow Chinese
born in the United States or Chinese who
had become ritizens . to return to the
United States if at any time they should
leave this country. - â¢
Dilltngham proposed an amendment ad
mitting "not to exceed five good faith rep
resentatives of each regularly established
Chinese wholesale house."
Dillingham explained tnat the amend
ment was in the Interest of the growing
commerce between the countries and to
bring Chinese buyers to this country.
Teller opposed the amendment as vicious
and as opening: the door to evasion of the
exclusion laws. The amendment was lost
â13 to 17.
Quay proposed an amendment that ex
clusion shall not apply to Chinese Chris
tians or Chinese who assisted in the de
fense ol relief of the foreign legations
or the Petang Cathedral in Peking in 1900.
In explaining the amendment Quay paid
a. tribute to the Christian religion as the
basis of civilization. . Â¦â¢...
SOME NEW AMENDMENTS.
SEAMAN'S CLAUSE OUT.
Quay exDrgssed his dissent from the
"general howl" against the Chinese as
such. He thought the bill should be much
amended. He said he ' would be In favor
of. excluding all immigrants as well as
Chinese for a term of five years. â¢
Mallory of Floriflaropposed'tfte. amend
ment and explained the necessity for the
seaman's clause as a measure of protec
tion to American sailors. â¢"'' Â¦ Â¦. : ; .
Klkins said the seaman's clause- was a
discrimination against American shipping
and in favor of foreign shipping. As to

H. C. Smith of Michigan closed the de

against the bill. If the pending bill had
originated j on the Democratic side, he
said, where it should have originated, the

Grosvenor, would have ridiculed it out of
the House. At 5:15 p..m. the House ad
journed .yntil 11 a.' m. to-morrow. -
.: Bell of Colorado also opposed the bill,
arguing that it was utterly indefensible
from any standpoint, in that it proposed
to take the tariff off raw material and
leave .untouched the tariff on the refined
product. He criticized severely the atti
tude of the Democrats toward the bill.
He said they taunted their Republican ad
versaries with supporting, a measure that
was "20 .per cent Democratic, forgetting
that in advocating' it . themselves they
were accepting ' a measure that was 80
per cent Republican. â¢ - .
.". Roberts of Massachusetts, Patterson of
Tennessee and Cochran of Missouri spoke
for the bill. Bar tlettcf Georgia opposed
the bill and in /the course of his remarks
criticized .Richardson,- the -minority lead
er, for hls\failure to file his views on the
pending measures. He declared that if
Democrats were -to support* Republican
measures the ranking I minority members
of the Ways and Means Committee should
be able to' furnish good reasons for such
a course. Corliss of Michigan in oppos

first principle of reciprocity. â¢.
â¢ Broussard v of ' Louisana made an Im

he said," would ruin the canÂ© sugar in

at the ferry. < .This Â¦ evidence â¢ was followed
by the testimony of William H. Miner.a

Dimmick leave the Berkeley train at Six

casions the witness crossed -the bay with

Doorkeeper C. h. Metcaif told how he
saw the defendant going* into the' cash
iers office several times after office hours
curing tne early part of the year 1901. On
June td Dimmlck asked Metcaif to note
tne time of his arrival and departure.
Mr. Donnelly was with DimmicK. When
the witness remarked thafrne did not un
derstand why Dimmick had maae that re
quest the defendant replied that he J did
it- for self-protection. /That, happened
about ten minutes before midnight. Ac
cording to the rules of the Mint- certain
cuuclais, Including Dimmick, were allowed
to visit the building after office hours. On
June 30, 1901, the witness at Dimmick's
request accompanied him to the casnier"s
oince where Gimmick took a book out

jectionable quality or substance. To get its beneficial effects it is always necessary to buy the

stipated condition of the system, take Syrup of Figs and enjoy freedom from the aches and
pains, the colds and headaches and the depression due to inactivity of the bowels. In case of
any organic trouble it is well to consult a competent physician, but when a laxative is required

the games which refresh and the foods which nourish are important, each in a way, while it is
also advantageous to hare knowledge of the best methods of promoting freedom from unsani-

Harry W. Heyer. a young man, dressed'
In the height of fashion, appeared before
Judge Megan yesterday to answer a
charge of assault to murder. He had been
arrested on complaint of his wife, who Is
Eeveral years his senior, but when, the
case was called she said she did not wish
to prosecute. Heyer remarked that It was
purely a family matter, but Judge Mogan
differed with him and ordered him into
custody. The case will be heard to-mor
row.
Mrs. Heyer Is the divorced wife of Mar
tin A. Devitt, a member of the firm, of
L>evitt, Tremble & Co., stock, brokers and
bankers oÂ£ Chicago. LÂ»evitt was her sec
ond husband and shortly after their mar
riage he became suspicious of her and
Heyer, who was at that time a clerk in
a. -wholesale hardware house in Chicago.
He employed private detectives to watch
the couple and Instituted suit for divorce,
making Heyer co-respondent. The di
vorce was granted about four months ago
and Devitt gave his divorced wife a pres
ent of 313,000.
Soon atterward she and Heyer were
married, but it was not long before he
was arrested for beating- her. She refused
to prosecute and the case was dismissed.
They left Chicago and came to this city,
furnishing a flat at 1116 Feh street in ele
gant style. Tuesday night, W. Wool
dridge, a cisar dealer at 119 Montgomery
etreet. and Miss Emmie Field of 1162
Broadway, Alameda, called at the Heyer
flat to spend the evening. Heyer was in
an ugly mood and quarreled with, his
Â¦wife, at whom he fired a shot. The bul
let passed through a silk wrapper which
Fhe wore. She then telephoned to the
O'Farrell-street police station and Police
man C. B. Harris went to the house and
placed Heyer .under arresL
Heyer was taken to the O'Farrell-street
police station and later to che City Prison
lie had been there only a few minutes
when his wife, accompanied by Wool
dridge and Miss Field, called to ball him
out. Mrs. Heyer offered Assistant War
rant and Bond Clerk Flood her check for
$5000 on the San Francisco Savings Union,
producing her bank book to show that she
had the money on deposit. Flood refused
to accept the check and then Wooldrldge
and Miss Field gave a bond for $1000,
qualifying on the property at 1162 Broad
way, Alameda.
When Heyer was released his wife had
eone home and as soon as he reached the
house he commenced to chastise her for
having him arrested. He nearly broke
her jaw and this so enraged Â».er that she
came to court yesterday morning with
the fixed purpose of prosecuting him.
When she heard the Judge remark that
her husband might get ten years for
fhooting at her. she relented and wanted
the case dismissed.
Prior to going into court, Heyer went
to thft Bond and Warrant Clerk's office
and asked for a warrant for his wife's
arrest on a charge of battery, but It was
refused. He claimed that she struck him

The Sherman has been at the Union Iron
Works since she arrived here, January t>,
1901. until a few days ago, when she re
turned to the transport, dock and was
placed in commission for 'active service.
She is now the most perfectly equipped
of all the ' transports and is said to be
from every standpoint the finest troop
ship In the world.
She sailed yesterday with fifty-one re
cruits, 100 marines, 416 members of the
Second Infantry. and 47' hospital corps
men. In addition to" these she carried
cabin passengers as follows:-
on the ferry depot dropped to the
base of the flagstaff the Sherman's lines
were cast off and tho big- trooper com
menced her long- voyage, on schedule time
to the second. A bugler. in the .Wiscon
sin tooted the strains of "Auld Lang
Syne" as the Sherman backed down the
bay, and in response to soldier cheers the
battleship's band played patriotic -airs
until the army vessel was beyond hearing
distance. The transport spent several
hours In the bay adjusting her compasses
before she passed out to sea. '
AFTER a sojourn in port of more
..than a year's duration the army

All signs of coal dust havlns been washed

thrown open to the inspection -of the public.

see one of Uncle Sam's biggest modern float-

Ftart on Monday . or Tuesday ' on her maiden
voj-agre. The vessel's enormous size is respon
sible for the delay. So high do her 6ldes stand
out of the water that it was found almost Im
possible to Vlace the coal on '. board ' with or
dinary gear. She has over twenty-five feet
of freeboard and the loading chutes with which
the average coal lighter is equipped are not
sufficiently elevated to reach over this height:.
A 8 a result the work of coaling the monster
has progressed very slowly." Future coaling
operations will probably be conducted by haul
ing the vessel under the coal bunkers, where
the chutes are , placed at an elevation grtat
enough to overreach even the Alaskan's tower
inr sides. .

Such "speculations are ingenious, but do riot-, come
within the domain of practical politics. .Moreover
they overlook altogether the influence of local 'patriot
ism" which a man draws from the land he lives in. The
American may have; been' born' of/ British', '-"German,'!
Out of the increasing migration of Americans to
the "new lands there has arisen a curious discussion
as to its probable effect on the political future of
Canada. It is asserted by some that the American
settlers will eventually, so far exceed the native Cana
dians in. numbers that the ( Western provinces will be
come essentially Ame'rican, and that through their
influence the annexation of Canada to the United
States will be peaceably effected. One writer says:
"It would at least make it certain that Canada could
not' adopt easily any policy, inimical to the United
States. Beyond question this population movement
makes for friendly relations and liberal international
policies." ; .â¢'"Â¦. . " .
~A short time ago the Boston Transcript published
a report from a correspondent at Minneapolis to the
effect that at the present rate of emigration from this
country to. Central and Western Canada, upward of
2,000,000 Americans will have settled in that country
within twenty years. The attraction to settlers has
been the rich wheat and pasture lands of Manitoba
and Assiniboia, and these are still far from being any
thing like filled up. - In fact the Canadian boomers
declare their great Western territories could support
a population of 75,000,000, if given proper cultivation!
At the present time the vast area of 2,144,796 square
miles has a population of only 656,464, of wljlom more
than .two-thirds live in Manitoba and British Colum
bia. Having then so much rich and well watered land
to spare, it' is significant of a high degree of enter
prise on the part of the Canadians that they should
undertake to. provide- further attractions by irrigat-'
irg arid lands.-
The proposed irrigation of arid lands in Canada is
the more important to us because for some years past
the Canadian Government has been trying to induce
settlers from the United States to take lands in the
Canadian Northwest, make homes there and build up
the Dominion^ The efforts have been of late remark
ably successful, and American migration to Canada
has become so extensive as to attract general atten-
WHILE Congress is hesitating and halting
over the proposed programme of irrigation
of the arid lands of the country, the Cana
dians, according to an official report from Consul
General Bittenger at Montreal, have made arrange
ments for redeeming upward of 3,000,000 acres of arid
land between Calgary and Medicine Hat. This action,
taken in connection with the plans already put into
operation by the Dominion and the Provincial gov
ernments for the protection and conservation of the
forests of the country, shows that in some important
respects Canadian statesmen are wiser than our own.
CANADIAN PROGRESS.
If, the opponents of the claims of the- aspiring Ter
ritories carl support their position with no better ar
guments than that they had -better give up with good
gracej; and ; vote ; for admission. " t ; Each j of ; the â¢ Terri- Â¦
tones? has a much' larger , area than "most of ; the older.
States, ; and there" is every prospect they will increase,
steadily ; in population. They.; are; already: well fitted
forbearing the' burdens of complete self-government
and should be welcomed to statehood 'without furtHer
("delay".' ;, ; " Â¦
In this argument we have a curious survival of the
old contest: between the large States and the little;
States that disturbed politics at the foundation of the
Union and led to the adoption of . the plan j of giving
each State equal representation in the Senate, while
proportioning the ' Representatives to population.
In those old days such interstate jealousies were not
wholly without cause, but it is difficult to understand
why they { should be felt in this day and' generation.
IfjArizona, Oklahoma and New Mexico are not to be
admitted to the dignity of statehood until they ; are as
populous as New York and Illinois, or even as-States
of medium^population, "".they will have ' ; to\ wait. a" long
time, and, nothing \vould be gained by compelling
them to wait. Senators from small States are not
less worthy, than Senators from big States. -They, do
not : vote : solidly on any issue, and so far as ; practical
politics is.concerned it matters little; whether the Sen
ator who votes for Republican measures comes from
Pennsylvania. or from. Rhode Island; "or whether he
who .votes for Democratic policies hails from Texas
or from "Delaware. - ' T .'"-. Â¦-' ' .'
The main argument of the opposition to the meas
ure is based upon the plea that the -admission of
the three States will unduly increase the membership
of the Senate in proportion to that of the House. A
recent dispatch from Washington. giving a summary
of the situation says those who afe hostile to the bill
/'have been studying the census report for 1900 and
find there are fifteen States with a population com
bined of 1,064,000 voters. These States are Idaho,
Delaware, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Utah
and Wyoming, with one. member each in the House
of Representatives, and Colorado, Florida, New-
Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode Island, : South Dakota,
Washington and Vermont, each having two members
in the House of Representatives. These fifteen
States, witha voting population of less than that of
either New York or Illinois, have only twenty-three
members of the House, but thirty United States Sen
ators. In the House they have no undue proportion
of power, but in the Senate they represent one-third
of that body and are ableto exercise great power in
all legislation."
ARIZONA, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have
been so far successful in their fight for admis
sion to the Union at this session of Congress
as to have; obtained from the Committee on Terri
tories a report favorable to their aspirations. It is
further claimed by their delegates at Washington
that a canvass of the House shows a strong majority
in favor of admission. . The opposition, however,
though in a minority, as formidable, and while the
prospects of the measure ar^ bright, success is by no
means certain.. ' .
FIGHTING FOR STATEHOOD.
Professor Barett Wendell of Harvard is reported
to have said in a recent lecture that there is a certain
editor in New York who "ought to be in hell." He
6. not name the fellow, but the audience under
stood and applauded mightily; and it is now up to
the public to guess whom he meant. . .
There was a very short corn crop last year, and
the beef trust officials declare the high price of beef
is due solely, to that fact, but this year there is every
prospect of a big crop and now we shall soori see
if that corn rule works both ways. .
SENATOR DEPEW has followed Senator Pen
rose in devising a means whereby without di
rectly opposing the election of United States
btnators by the popular vote the movement toward
it can be defeated. Like the Senator from Penn- ;
tylvania he has declared on the floor of the Senate
a willingness to submit his own candidacy to the
people, but in the committee-room he has submitted
in amendment that will surely kill the resolution
passed by the House.
The amendment declares: "The qualifications of
citizens entitled to vote for United States Senators
and Representatives in Congress shall be uniform in
all the States, and Congress shall have power to en
force this article by appropriate legislation, and to
provide for the registration of citizens entitled to
vote, the conduct of such elections and the certifi-
It will be seen that the Depew amendment is much
more ingenious than that of Penrose and is therefore
much 'more dangerous. The proposal of the Penn
sylvania Senator that in amending the constitution
so as to admit of the election of Senators by direct
vote of the people provision should be made for ths
apportionment of Senators among the States in pro
portion to population is too crude to be effective.
No considerable number of persons could be brought
to insist upon such an amendment, and consequently
it could not be used to divide the supporters of the
original icsolution. The Depew amendment is not
crude. It will command a very large support. In
fact, it has already obtained the support of a majority
of the Senate committee, and it will give a good
rrany Senators an excuse for voting against the
original resolution unless the amendment be ac
cepted. ' , *".';'"
Strong, however, as may be the sentiment in favor
of equal suffrage laws throughout the Union, it will
not be strong enough to set aside the American doc
trine that each State should regulate its own elec
tions and determine for itself the qualifications for
franchise. Senator Depew doubtless i? well aware of
that fact, and has introduced his amendment not with
any expectation of seeing it adopted, but solely with
a view of affording himself and some of his col
leagues a chance to escape the necessity of having
to vote directly against the resolution. , .
It is but fair to the New York Senator to say he
makes a good and strong argument for his proposi
tion. After referring to the JFact that "a number. of
States have by various devices prevented a third or
more ol citizens recognized as such by the constitu
tion of the United States from exercising the right
of suffrage," and pointing out that the evil does not
receive the attention it merits because the House of
Representatives being elected by the people, the
unjust discrimination is not acutely felt, he goes on
to. say: "But if in the election of United States Sen
ators a small oligarchy in any State is to Tend an
equal representation here to legislate with great
States like New York, which have nfanhood suf
frage; if States in which half of the votes are dis
franchised are to have an equal voice in this body
with States like Pennsylvania, of five or ten times
their population and with manhood suffrage; if New
York, because that commonwealth by the manhood
suffrage casts 1,547.912 votes, is to be neutralized in
legislation affecting her vast interests by Mississippi,
casting 55.000 votes, because the maj-iity of her. citi
zens arc disfranchised, then the situation becomes in
tolerable." , â¢
No one can question the truth of that statement,
and yet the only practical effect of the Senator's
proposition will be the defeat of the movement for
the election of Senators by direct vote of ths people.
Thus another much desired reform is blocked by the
Southern question and another illustration given of
the extent to which a local wrong may prove, a na
tional evil.

casion of Mrs. Zeisler's last visit here, the
concertgoers are slowing waking to the
fact that a great pianist is among them,
and probably, .as it was then, the later
concerts will, be crowded. No. pianist ap
pearing 1 here . has been greeted by more
spontaneous and hearty applause than
was accorded to Mrs. Zeisler's efforts yes

that ended with a brilliant rendering of
the G minor "Ballade," the pianist was
recalled with . thunderous demand, that
she gracefully satisfied by giving the

plause, broke out again .wildly, and Mrs.

SENATOR DEPE WS FLAN.
With the elimination of the bosses and their
henchmen from the A campaign everything will be
propitious to Republican success. That much was
made abundantly evident at San Jose. Outside of the
Gage gang all were for harmony. It was a convention
to which the party can point with pride. There were
many aspirants for the Governorship present and
each of them had a host of friends, but there was no
slightest; show of ill-feeling except the one ill-bred
slur cast by Gage's letter. The bosses, then, are the
only , menace to the party. Let Billy Herrin's gang
be sent to the rear and there will be assured through
out the Republican host a harmony and an enthu
siasm that will render .victory a 'foregone conclusion
from the day the campaign opens.
The importance ofsuch a demonstration as that at
San'Jose should not be overlooked. The . people of,
California are well acquainted with the forces, that
are behind the Gage movement. The assurances he
gave in his former campaign of freedom from boss
control and railroad affiliations cannot be given again
without exciting derisive laughter. The people have
not forgotten how promptly/ after he took office
Gage j showed himself j conspicuously in the railroad
camp as an ally of Billy Herrin seeking the election
of Dan Burns to the United States Senate. They re
member how he has degraded the Normal schools
and the charitable institutions of the State to the
spoils of politics in order to provide salaries for
predatory politicians. They know also that he is a
party to the scheme embodied iri "Assembly consti
tutional amendment No. 28, by which corporations
in control of public utilities would be able to fix
rates to suit themselves and laugh at every attempt
on the part of the public to obtain redress. Know
ing these things, the rank' and, file of the Republican
party will not support the tool of the bosses. Gage
must go. .
OUT of. the convention of the State League of
Republican Clubs there has come a lesson so
clear that it cannot be mistaken -by any one.
âthe lesson of harmony. There was but a single, dis-'
turbing feeling among the members from first to last,
and that was lest the bosses might attempt; by trick-:
ery or bulldozing to force an indorsement of Gage's
candidacy. There was but one disturbing incident in'
the proceedings, and that -was the letter from Gage
flinging insults at every other aspirant for the Gov
ernorship. Those facts are , significant. ' No one can
mistake their plain meaning. The one menace to Re
publican harmony and Republican success ; in ; this
campaign is the persistency of the corporations and
the bosses to force upon /the party the renomination
of the discredited Governor.
THE CONVENTION LESSON.
The shocking recital of criminal instincts, dastardly
purposes arid cruel actions which the 'court investiga
tion of the attack made upon an aged man in this city '_
reveals discloses a phase of local life which it is bet
ter, perhaps, for the public not to know. ,
We have long feared that the insistence upon this
policy would lead to just such an imprudent declara
tion. The manufacturers have been the constant ob
jects of protection ever since 1789. Their enterprises
have grown to enormously profitable proportions.
Their business is of such a nature that it lends itself
readily to combination, to an aggregation of re
sources for reaching a profitable market. So on
the one side they have protection by tariff and on the
other the mighty power of aggregated strength, and
yet it is pleaded for them that they must have a re
duction in Cuban duties of 50 per cent purchased
by a similar] Subvention to the Cuban farmer. This
will not be forgotten. The farmers caricombine on
only one day in the year, and that is. election dayyaifd â¢
if these criticisms and declarations are persisted in
the responsibility for such combination will be easily
fixed.
The Philadelphia Ledger and other Republican
organs of free trade repeat the offense in a no less
offensive form. That paper says: "The bill should
be passed, and if the reduction were SO per cent in
stead of 20 the result would be better for Cuban
products and for American manufactures."
That is to say, the bill is for the benefit of Ameri
can manufacturers and Cuban farmers!
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska
and the other agricultural States have been the
stronghold of protection, when the farmer listened to
a purely theoretical statement of its benefit. to him.
The chance to produce his own sugar took the
farmer above theory and gave him his first taste of
the profits of protection. Now, from the War De
partment to Congress, he is being, abused because
he likes the taste.
It may well be noted now that the hard things said
by the advocates of free trade with Cuba are said
against the American farmer. The Republicans who
are saying them are preparing the way for an anti
protection campaign among the farmers that will
sweep the system off our statute-books.
The American organs of the junta are, working
daily, none pleased with 20 per cent 'and all wanting
free trade. It will scon puzzle 20 per. cent to find
any friends. The domestic sugar farmers do not want
it, because it is too much. The Department of War
and Political Economy does not want it, because it is
too little. The junta spurns it and cries famine and
ruin if it pass, and if it pass no one will be pleased
except the small number of Republican. free traders'
who betray protection by treating it not as a stable
economic principle but as a policy of expediency, to
be petted one campaign as a pup, and the next
butchered for a pig.
President-elect Palma, who has just left his
eighteen years' residence in New York to be in
augurated in Havana, and speaks of leaving his
"home with regret," also rejects the 20 per cent re
duction and prefers free trade. SenorAbad, who has
boasted that one member of the junta raises more
sugar in Cuba than all the sugar beet, farmers in the
United States combined, joins in spurning 20 per
cent, and wants at least 50 per cent off 'our tariff if
free trade cannot be had now. ; Governor General
Wood, who is about to surrender his satrapy, will
return as a lobbyist for free trade.
BY the defection of Mr. Babcock and the vote
.of Democratic members a concession of 20
per cent was secured for Cuban products in
iue Ways and Means Committee. This is not satis
factory to- the junta nor to our own War.Depart
ment, which has assumed control of economic legisla
tion, and works at it what time it has to spare from
snubbing the lieutenant general of the army.

How to buy furniture

without ready
We will loan you the money for a regular banking
rate of interestâ six per cent. And you can pay tÂ»
back little by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the first-class furniture stores, with ; whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big and fresh and where satisfaction is certain, and
. ' when you have made youf selection you can pay your
bill. in full. with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
arid being compelled to select your goods" from smaller
and inferior stocks? Â¦ .
-The installment stores charge "you ten per ' cent
above their cash prices when you ask for long credit.
AH you pay us is six per cent.
For example:, If your, purchases amount to $100.00
we will charge you $106.00 â which is a six per cent
advance; then you pay us $moo cash and the balance
in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month.
If your purchases amount to $75.00 we will charge you
$79-50; you make us a cash payment on this of $15.00
and pay the balance at the easy r,ate of $6.45 per
You save four per cent. You have the prreat privi-
lege of buying in a first-class store, and yet you get
, all the advantages of the easy payment plan as offered
,,/:.- by the installment houses!
No amount of money is too small for us to loan.
Worth looking into, don't you think?

They Hold Conference Witli Officials,
Who Decide Half of Roadway
Shall Be Clear.
A conference of representative mer
chants and manufacturers, , Commission
ers of Â¦. Public Works Mendell, Casey and
Manson, Mayor Schmitz and C. J. King
of the ' Merchants' Association was held
yesterday in the : assembly room . of the
Board of Works.' The object was to se
cure an - expression of opinion as to
whether it could be arranged. so that not
more than one-half of the sidewalks be
obstructed in conducting business in the
wholesale . district.
Commissioner Casey called attention to
the fact that the privilege of using a por
tion of the sidewalk during . the receipt
and delivery of goods was being abused,
and so many, complaints had been re
ceived, that something should be done to
relievo the situation so that pedestrians
might have an unobstructed passage.
Casey said that the roadways of the
streets were .being constantly obstructed
and referred to boilers- and machinery
stored on the sidewalks In the foundry
district for an indefinite period.
Mayor Schmitz stated that the board did
not mean to harass the merchants in the
conduct of their business and asked if the
dry ' goods people would be satisfied if
an ordinance requiring the sidewalks to
be kept clear for half their width would
be passed. Representatives of various in
dustries expressed themselves as satisfied
with the requirement. Attorney Gartland
explained that the proposed ordinance
contemplated the temporary occupancy
of a sidewalk during business hours only.
It was thereupon decided "to require that
half the sidewalk be kept clear.
Mayor Schmitz to Address Students.
At the graduation exercises of the edu
cational department of the Young Men'3
Christian Association this evening Mayor
Schmitz will address the -students. An
attractive musical programme, consisting
of vocal and instrumental music, has been
arranged. One hundred and twenty-fl ve
certificates will be issued to graduates in
the various departments. An exhibit of
students' work will be displayed.

jrood-sized crop. Very likely the first real set
bac-K will come in Wall street, which will be
the first to feel the effects of overdoing, and
the first to anticipate any reaction. It is per
lectly true, however, to say that Wall street
does not feel any apprehensions on that score;
on the contrary there is s. feeling of reasonable
optimism in the street, which is quite likely to
be reflected in a higher range of prices. As we
nave eaid toefore. good investments are ex
ceedingly scarce and there is plenty of money
to invest: so that while prices are high it is im
possible to say they cannot go higher under fa
vorable conditions. The market has had fully
e:x months of rest, during which the weak
spots have been pretty well eliminated, and
legal uncertainties affecting the merger deal*
tre not likely to receive much attention for
some time to come. With good crops there
would be little wanting just now to give us a
bnter market than confident leadership.
Whether that will be forthcoming or not re
mains to be seen."
"The stock market has exhibited greater ac
tivity and strength. Each day witnessed a
steadily broadening market, and the facility
with which lirst one slock was advanced and
then another showed a high degree of manipu
lation, which excited more or less distrust in
the stability of the present movement. Manip
ulation wan of course the chief factor in the
sharp advances; though no extended moi'ement
in the market is ever successful without stimu
lant of some sort, and much depends upon the
circumstances on which the manipulation is
based, as well as upon those who assume the
lead. Wall street is Just now being treated
to fcume experiences in leadership. A bold
and wealthy clique of Western capitalists have
stepped into the speculative arena and created
more or less sensation by the methods which
they adopted to create activity. These gentle
men hyive amassed large fortunes through the
great industrial combinations which they helped
promote during the last three years. Having
large sums cf money at their disposal, and con
trolling lending institutions that add to their
resources, their power in the market cannot be
ignored. Everything depends, however, upon
the sort of leaders they prove to be. _-.Â«^^

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
ing was in evidence all day long, which kept
xhe price almost constantly below last night's
level. The stock's net loss was %. There
was some selling induced by the emphatic dis
claimers on the part of the Southern Railway
interests of any participation in the Louisville
and Nashville purchases, present or prospec
tive, but the distinction drawn between J. 1\
Morcan & Co. as bankers and the same firm
as the control! Ing influence in Southern Rail-_
way seemed somewhat strained. The exten
sive power over the affairs of Louisville and
Nashville allotted to thelirm seems sufficient se
cunty for its operation in harmony with Southern-
Railway. The brokers most active in the sell
ing- of that stock. to-day were those that wtre
heaviest buyers yesterday and who have oper
ated conspicuously for the so-called Gates ele
ment in" all the railroad deals of late. They
were sellers of 1 other stocks which have re
cently been bought up to a materially higher
level. But they also were large buyers at new
points in the market, having a large part in
the advance of the coalers, both hard and soft.
The buyins of Chesapeake and Ohio, Norfolk
and Western and Baltimore and Ohio seemed
to be based on the assumption that they should
enjoy the same advantage as those of Southern
Railway In similar and neighboring .territory.
The Western end Pacific stocks, ss a rule,
were subject to realizing, but there were a
number of smaller railroads whose stocks were
sharply advanced with an appearance of ab
sorption for control. > which - really -induced a
speculative following among the professionals
because of -the. prevalent feeling in Wall street
that a "railroad cannot be left out over night
without being snapped up by some syndicate,"
in the expressive phrase of the president of one
of the coalers. Wisconsin Central was the most
conspicuous Instance of this class, both of '-its
stocks rising more 'than 3 points and closing
strong in contrast with a reactionary tendency
in some parts of the market. There was a
large number of* minor stocks which showed
gains of a point or more at one time during
thÂ«? day. but the cases are rare where the full
advance was sustained. Sugar became strong
for a time on the decision to limit tha period
for debate on the Cuban reciprocity bill.
Amalgamated Copper was sold on account' of
the reduction in Anaconda's dividend and fears
that similar action would be taken to-morrow
in the Amalgamated dividend. International
Power- mp.de an extraordinary upward move
ment of 19% points, closing with a net gain- of
17Vi. Rumors were current of some . combina
tion with -American Locomotive. Â¦ The gains
were not well maintained in any case and
there were not a few declines during the day
among important stocks, but the evidence that
the financial powers which have been leading
the speculation were still active kept the in
terest in the market awake. .Â¦ :
The money market showed no disturbance
and there was no advance ' in the Â¦ exchange
market despite larsre sales of stocks, for Lon
don account and the prospective demand for
exchange on account of American subscriptions
to the new British consol loan, the' times ot
issue of which were i announced ' to-dav. ' The

' KESWICK. April 16.â The fire In the
Iron Mountain mine Is spreading. The
miners were yesterday driven from the
new copper level, which' has been a lead
ing source of ore supply, and the tunnel
has been closed. .This is the second Im
portant level that. has been-closed within
a month. It is not timber that is burning,
but the great bodies of sulphide ore.
Water cannot reach it, and it is believed
that the fire will burn for years. The
best that can be .done is to hold the fire
within its present bounds and tap the
mountain of ore from new directions.
This has been done.

HOTEL DEL CORONADO, April i 16.â
The members of the Transcontinental
Passenger Association were hard at work
from early this morning, until late in the
afternoon.-. During the sessions business
of great importance was transacted. ; For
several hours the j interchangeable 1 mile
age ticket was discussed. The new method
met with no opposition and wnl 1 be adopt
ed \ at^ the morning session -to-morrow.
This new ticket will be good for 3000 miles
and will be recognized by all roads west
of Denver. The ticket will i be sold to
traveling men, Â¦ commencing on Junel,
and its advent will be hailed with delight.
What promises to create a sensation in
the Western railroad -world is the fact
that within a few months the Great
Northern, the Northern Pacific and the
Canadian Pacific will become members of
the Transcontinental Association. Thesa
roads are at present out of the pool, but
from 'an authentic source-it is given out
that they , are already moving to Join
the association. The Northern roads in
the past, though not members of the pool,
have worked. in harmony with the asso
ciation and it is said that their applica
tion' for membership is being discussed.
Representatives from, their passenger de
partments are here, and, though. not al
lowed to vote, attend all of the sessions.
The Southeastern roads have sent in a
big protest at the present division of cir
cuit rates. They claim they have not re
ceived a fair percentage of - the money
paid by passengers for tickets. They ac
cordingly filed . a protest with the asso
ciation and a committee has studied the
situation. To-day the committee reported
that it believed the Southeastern ( roads
were receiving a fair ah,are and recom
mendedithat no change should be made.'

clmculty of the task and the excellence
of the performance on Saturday. Special
trains will be run from different points to
the university for Saturday's production
of the play, which is to commence in the
forenoon at 11 o'clock. After its close an
hour will be allowed for luncheon previ
ous to the opening of the annual track

will be given In the evening by the Cali
fornia and Stanford musical clubs, at the
close of whiclra train will take the vis
itors to San Francisco. -"f.v!*
"Antigone," - the most popular of the
Greek tragedies, has been played' before
nearly all of the European courts. As
Greek drama was developed from songs
and dances in masquerade, the chorus is
an important and characteristic feature.
The cnorus in "Antigone" represents^ a
body of Theban elders who act as coun
selors of the King; their words and songs
hav^ direct connection with and explain
otherwise obscure parts of the play. Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough of the department
of classical literature, who has been in
strumental in bringing about the produc
tion of "Antigone," takes the important
part of leader and" spokesman of' the
chorus. Dr. -A. T. Murray, professor of
Greek, will appear as the King, and Miss
Eunice Cooksey, a special student in
Greek, will play the title role. ..
The music iot the occasion will be sup
plied by a university orchestra of thirty
pieces, which has nad careful training
under the supervision of Professor Stew
art W. Young, who has resigned the lead
ership for the two : performances to Ar
thur L. Scott-BrooK, the university- or
ganist and trainer of the chorus. Both
tne acting and the supplementary chor
uses, forming a total ot fifty men, I have
been trained by Mr. Scott-Brook, and
their singing at the last dress rehearsal
has shown how thorough his work had
been. The music for the play, which was
written by Mendelssohn, is remarkably
beautiful, and the ability shown by stu
dents In mastering the Greek songs Is
praiseworthy. " â¢
Not mure, than a half dozen Greek
plays have ever been given in this coun
try, the , present enterprise coming Just
twenty-one years after the first, which
was tne rendition of Sophocles' "Oedipus
Tyrannus" at Harvard University in ls&l.
Une "Electra" has been played at Smith
College and "Antigone" nas been staged
both at Vassar and Swarthmore colleges,
but never betore has a Greek production
been prepared exclusively by college tal
ent, as tne Stanford pertormance will be.
.Every minute detail, of acting, costuming
and music is in the hands of members or
the university.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 16.â
During the ,past' four months nearly 100
of the students and faculty of Stanford
University have been engaged in the prep
aration of Sophocles* Greek tragedy,
"Antigone," the first performance - of
which will occur. in the Assembly Hall
to-morrow night and the' second t on Sat
urday morning before the intercollegiate
field day games. The aim of the Greek de
partment in giving a Greek tragedy' i3 in
keeping with j the tendency at Stanford
to encourage literary | and musical pro
ductions as exemplified by . the number of
high class concerts that have occurred
during the present. college year and- the
approaching production ol a Spanish play.
The idea in staging "Antigone" is purely
that of arousing and increasing the inter
est in classical studies on tnis coast.

The story Thompson tells is more, than
ordinarily interesting as snowing, .the
limit of -endurance > in â¢ case ' of â¢'life'- or
death; . ; Thompson .; started alone to pros
pect on one of the, side ; streams a â¢ hun
ared miles up White River. C When three
days - out ,'f torn Dawson the; snow' was
drifted i so badly that . he could drag ., his
sled; no further. Starting back he. had
the- option of - carrying his bedding . or
fome provision, and r chose the latter.
Ho Â¦: thought then that he could ./make
camp with two , forced marches and sleep
at a campflre. ": .,
On Jhe second -day's start- h6 had - to
lighten again. Dividing: his pack, he
took the wrong bundle, leaving all of his
matches behind. This vital mistake was
r.ot discovered until night. It was bitter
ly cold and the night was., too dark ; to
keep the trail. Realizing that he must
keep moving," Thompson broke a- path
around 7 a tree and walked it all night.
The next day he lost ; the trail soveral
times,. and from overexertion had -grown
so stupid that he ' could: not recognize
landmarks. He describes his" experience
in walking around a tree again that night
as awful torture. Several times he fell
asleep, being awakened by:' falling', into
the snow bank. Each time this; caused
an energetic : struggle, because he' 'was
tempted ' to stay down and continue | a
slumber that would have meant death.
Love of life gained the mastery , each
time, and he kept on moving. â¢ V
On the following day Thompson's mind
was almost, a blank. He ate nothing but
a -few pancakes, which he had put into
his shirt to thaw. : Another terrible night
was. passed, .Thompson working sums in
mental . arithmetic, t reciting poetry rand
sticking pins into himself to keep awake.
This night .of agony ended, he soon
reached a camp of . ; . his friends and â¢ fell
exhausted on entering their, cabin. : 'Â¦

"It is well known that the Feather Riv
er is the largest tributary of the Sacra
mento, and only second to the Sacra
mento in the volume of its discharge,
while the greater portion of the flow of
the Feather comes from the watersheds
tributary to the reservoir sites purchased
by E. T. Karl and his associates. These
reservoirs when constructed will be with
out parallel in California, or anywhere in
the western half of the United States,
and will be so designed as to equalize the
flow of the stream available for power to
about 1500 cubic feet per second.. From
the main reservoir, In Big Meadows, it
is proposed to construct a canal to the
Butte Valley reservoir, about ten miles in
length, the water being delivered into
this reservoir, whence it will be carried
along the edge of the canyon of Feather
River by a series of tunnels for a dis
tance of five miles to Mosquito Creek.
There it will be given a vertical fall of
1600 feet, producing a total of about 270,000
horsepower." , ; . , :
"The watershed area tributary to these
reservoirs is about 600 square miles^ on
which the most prominent elevation is
Lawson's Peak, a region of perpetual
snow. The average rainfall of that re
gion for the last twenty years has been
about sixty-seven Inches, and for the
twenty years previous to that about sev
enty inches, with a range of from thirty
three Inches as a minimum to 103 inches
Â£.s a maximum.
"The location of this proposed scheme
is in Plumas County, from which point an
electric current can be transmitted to
San Francisco, a distance of 180 miles "
said Schuyler. "The water supply is to
be obtained from the north fork; of the
Feather River and impounded in two res
ervoirs of extraordinary size, Â¦ one of
which will cover Â«000 acres and the other,
in Butte Valley, a few miles distant and
some 2aO feet lower, will cover about 20J0
acres. Â¦ . .
James D. Schuyler, the hydraulic en
pineer, one of the organizers of the com
pany, presents certain interesting facts
in regard to the organization. He says
the amount of water which It is proposed
to utilize will be about 120,000 miner's
inches.

"In five week* I weighed 123 pounds, a l
gain of thirteen pounds, and I. feel so
strong that 1 have been able to do from
ten to fifteen hours of hard work daily.
My mind ha* never seemed no clear be-
tore. and I am thoroughly convinced that
there Is no food like Grape-Nuts to pro-
Cuce health and a strong and clear brain."
Lee Arlington. Box 1755, Iowa' City/ la.Y'
"It was about this time I came home
from school, broken down physically and*
dentally. I only weighed 120 pounds. At*
my earnest request, mother began serv- \
Ing Grape-Nuts every meal, and she said?
the had never eaten anything that agreed ;
wiih her physical condition as did my j
'new food,' as she termed it.
*"I had been suffering from a full feeling
after meals and generally - more or less
headache/ All trouble left me when I
quit using white bread, warm biscuits,

It is profitable for any one to study
food In order to regulate the health, not
with medicine, but by building up healthy
nerve centers with good food.
A man who has made something of a
study on this line writes from Iowa City:
"When I first tried Grape-Nuts It was at
the table of a prominent State official, and
the" remarkable taste attracted me. I aft-
erward investigated the subject carefully
and discovered that Grape-Nuts contains
dextrose eugar. The starchy part of the
food Is transformed into starch sugar or
dextrose. Those same results are; pro-
duced by the digestive organs by. the ac-
tion of Jbe eallva and the pancreatic
juices en starchy foods. These facts con-
vince me that Grape-Nuts is a natural,
predigt-sted food "and Just what I. re-
quired and needed. ' . â¢ '

M'COMB SEEKS
AID OF COURT
Demands That Fredrick
Surrender Clerk's
Records.
Attorney Ruef Makes an
Argument for Mayor's
Appointee.
Powel Fredrick, Mayor Schmiu's ap
pointee to the office of Chief Clerk of the
Justices' Courts, appeared before Judge
Sloss yesterday to -show cause why 'he
should not deliver to George McCcmb
the records and documents which are in
his possession. Attorney Ruef, who rep
resented Fredrick, dcslriug to avert the
fight for the j books, offered the sugges
tion when the case was called that the
pending summary proceedings be dropped
and the case be .carried at once to the
Supreme Court, so that a decision might
be secured- on the merits Â©f the contro
versy.
â¢ By carrying it to tno highest court in
the State " tne case would be at once
and finally settled, not only regarding
the ownership of the records, but also
as to which of the two contestants is the
do Jure clerk. As. Attorney Leon Sim
uels, who Â« acted as Â¦ McComb's counsel,
would not accept Ruef's suggestion, the
Court ordered the case to De proceeded
with. Almost the entire day was con
sumed in argument.
â¢ Before the battle of words commenced
both McComb and Fredrick were placed
en" the stand, so that the exact status of
affairs might be learned. McComb -told
about the ejection and subsequent resig
nation of Williams and of the Installation
of Fredrick by the aid of the police. He
told of his election to the office of
Chief Clerk by the Supervisors and of
his establishing his office in the cham
bers of Justice of the Peace Groezinger.
Ho claimed that his signature is recog
nized . by the Sheriff, Auditor, County
Clerk and . the Justices.
Samuels Goes Away Sack.
Fredrick . also related the events that
have transpired since the eventful day on
which Williams and his assistants were
driven out of the Clerk's olflce by the
police. He testified that since that time
he has been in peaceful and undisputed
possession of the rooms in which the rec
ords of the Chief Clerk are treasured.
He admitted that McComb made a de
mand upon, him to vacate the office and
thct his - authority has . not been recog
nized by the Sheriff.
: Attorney Samuels came well provi
sioned and equipped for taking part ii. a
lengthy argument. Embanked behind a
huge fortification of books, he com
menced firing his forensic torpedoes at
Judge Sloss. He contended that Mayor
Schmitz had not the power to veto the
election of McComb by the Supervisors
and that ' Fredrick's forcible entrance
to the office of Chief Clerk did not give
him the least color of right to the posi
tion. â¢ â¢â¢; â¢ :.-';-,.< V
Veto Power of the Mayor.
Attorney - Samuels argued that the
charter does not explicitly confer the
veto power in the Mayor In all cases
and where it Is not explicitly conf errd it
is withheld. So earnest was the atior
ney in impressing on the Court the dan
ger of allowing the Mayor an unlimited
veto power that he read voluminous.ref
erences on the point at issue and called
the attention of the Court to how the
English people of centuries past had cir
cumscribed their King In the use of -this
dangerous prerogative. He even went so
far as to, trace the history cf the word
"veto" back to the time of its origin in
the days of the Romans.
Attorney Ruef made a very strong ar
gument in behalf .of Fredrick's claim to
the office. - He commenced Immediately
a discussion -of the vital: points at Issue.
-He contended that McQomb could not re
cover the books from Fredrick by prov
ing: a defect In his claim to the clerk
ship, but that he must demonstrate his
right to the. property by proving that his
own claims were stronger and more valid.
- Ruef devoted his time principally, how
ever, to proving the Mayor's . authority
to exercise the veto power over all bills
and acts passed by tne Board of Super
visors. He read from the charter sec
tions to the effect that all bills and reso
lutions must bo signed by the Mayor,
and he quoted a decision of Judsre Heb
bard-showing- that not even could a reso
lution . passed by the Supervisors ex
pressing condolence for the widow of
President "McKinley become binding until
it had received the Mayor's signature. He
contended that inasmuch as the election
of McComb involved an expenditure of.
public money, it was especially essential
that the Mayor should approve of the act
before it could be put In force.
At this point Attorney Ruef was forced"
to . discontinue his argument until this
morning, at 10 o'clock. : *.>
Ruppel Killed by His Horss.
' An inquest was held yesterday by Cor-,
oner Leland on : the body of Conrad Rup
pel, an aged hog:, rancher, who was thrown
from his.. wagon In a collision with, an
electric car In front of 4263 Mission street.
April 5. The jury returned â¢ a verdict of
the effect that death was caused by an
accident, "due to the plunging of the
horse attached to his wagon after said
wagon had been struck by an electric car.
The combined effect of the plunge of the
horse and the shock of the collision hav
ing produced the fall which produced
death."

Kaufman claims he . was not with the
gang at the time Robinson was shot,. but
he was informed of the facts early that
morning, and â¢â¢ at once got under cover.
He remained hidden with ! Woods, who
was shot twice by Robinson, and he told
where they were sheltered and who aided
them to escape north. These \ abettors
will probably be in custody to-day if they
have not. already taken fright from tha
fact that Kaufman .was brought back,
and sought safety in flight.
. Kaufman â¢ attributes the actual killing
to Woods, who fired four shots into the
body of Robinson, and who on return was
wounded . twice by the officer. Henderson
was also shot by the policeman as he was
running away. The other man ' now in
custody is James Courtney, alias "Lead
vllle Jimmle," now wanted in New York
State for murder.-
All that the police desire to know re
garding the murder of- Policeman Eugene
Robinson on the morning of December 21
was divulged last night to Captain of De
tectives Seymour and Di3trict Attorney
Byington by Louis | Kaufman, alla3 "St.
Louis Fat,'*" the suspect who was brought
back from Fort Williams, Ont., by De
tective Wren and Policeman Taylor Sun
day night. From the moment of the sus
pect's arrival it was evident that if prop
erly, handled he would be willing to di
vulge the entire story of the acts of the
murderous gang of thieves who occupied
the 'Turk-street flat, and to whom the
death of Policeman Robinson was due.
As far as the actual killing was concerned
the case was fairly conclusive against the
four men now in the tanks on suspicion
of being connected with the murder, and
"Kid" Goucher and "Brownie," who are
still at- large, but the desire or the police
was to get the names of the men who
disposed of the plunder which was the re
sult of the thieving operations of the
gang.
This information was given Captain
Seymour last night by Kaufman, and he
Is now in the possession of the names of
the men. who peddled the spoils stolen by
the other six. thieves. It is not claimed
that either of these was privy" to the
murder, but in - addition to acting as
fences, they: sheltered all of the gang
after the crime. was committed except
Henderson, who was so- badly wounded
that he could not. escape; and fell into
the hands of the police near the scene of
the shooting. -.:Â¦'Â¦'Â¦

Police Have All Facts
of the Robinson
Murder.
The suicide 'Â¦was about' 43 years of age
and was a well-known character . in the
northern part of the city. His father was
a pioneer and erected a soap factory on
the present site of the. power-house at
Mason and Washington streets. The son
inherited about $50.000 ' worth of property
on Bernard. Jones and Pacific streets
from his mother, who died about -fifteen
years ago. The lots were mostly occupied
by ehacks and the property Â¦was not very
productive, so Russell mortgaged it for
nearly its entire value to the Hibemia
Bank. Notice of foreclosure was served
on him Tuesday and this is supposed to
have prompted him to end his existence.
He had been in the habit of sleeping in
one of his shacks.. which, he rented to a
Japanese named Tasuda Masuichi, and he
went there yesterday afternoon about 4
o'clock. Two hours later the Japanese
'ound the dead body lying before the
flressing case and a razor lay by the side
if the corpse. . . . . . ... .
Russell was at one. time a partner in
Confronted with a foreclosure of a
mortgage on his property, the proceeds
of which had been dissipated in former
years, Horatio Russell, a native-born San
Franciscan , put an end to his life last
night. He stood before a mirror-and with
a razor nearly severed his head from, his
body. He inflicted .two '.cuts 'upon' his
throat. The first one did not succeed in
bisecting the cartilage surrounding the
vocal cords, so a second gash was made
that must have proved almost immediate
ly fatal.

Greayer. who was killed In the park about
eight years ago by Policeman â¢ Harper,
the trial of whom for murder was one of
the historical criminal cases of this city.
Judge Fritz decided that the contention
of defendant's counsel was well taken
and held that the charter provision was
unconstitutional. .
The case was submitted on briefs. Col
onel Preston and ex-Judge Cope, who ap
peared for the defendant, contended that
subdivision 1, section A chapter 1, article
VI of the charter on which the ordinance
was based was unconstitutional, as it was
In direct conflict with section 19. article II
of the constitution, which authorizes indi
viduals and corporations to tear up streets
for the purpose of laying conduit pipes
under the supervision, of the Superintend
ent of Streets or Board of Public Works.
An important decision was rendered by
Judge Fritz yesterday regarding the
power of the Board of Public Works to
refuse to issue a permit to the.Indepen
dent Electric Light and Power Company
to tear up streets for the purpose of lay
ing conduit pipes. Judg'e FTitz held that
the board was acting beyond Its author
ity in such refusal. The defendant in the
case was Walter S. Dole, who was
charged with violating sections 1 and 2
of ordinance 2S8 of the Board of Super
visors by tearing up Kentucky street, be
tween Twentieth and Twenty-second,
without a permit from the Board of
Works.

In the United States Court on

. "I'm an "old" boxer,",. Dr. \ Chase >' says,
"just feel' my arm.' Don't think I
wasn't right there. But I 'couldn't*, fight
off such a mob. A. young lady came 'past,
afterwardâ she Â¦ was much Impressedâ
and she said it was ; the gamest; struggle
she had ever : seen â me against ; twenty."
"One of their gang hit me over the head
"He was a husky big cur. and they
agreed to let me fight him alone. I had
him whipped when they all Jumped me
again. 1 had struck him twice and he
fell forward right, into my arms.' I
caught him with my left arm. and wm
about to hit him again with my right
when some one jumped on my back and
dragged me down again. That toolc.the
heart right out of me."
The get-away of Dr. Brady is about
the only feature of the engagement on
which all- concerned are agreed.
"They came. with a gang," says 'Billy'
McNevin. "expecting to do me up. II had
my brother, the football, player,. . along,
and he is gang enough for â¢ me. What
did I need a gang for; with him?therc . to
see fair play? When we mixed up i their
crowd, six or eight of them, came at me.
I had. to fight my way through them, to
get at Chase. While he .was down I, said,
'Get up. I'll give you a chance -to -. get
on- your feet,' but "he* lay. there -and,- said,
he hadn't done any stalking. - His; gang
had taken to their heels by that r time."

TWO hosts met , in gory conflict
Monday night in Union Square,
and not satisfied, with the arbitra
ment of battle the principals on
one side will carry, the case . Into
court. Dr. George T. Brady and' Dr.
George M. Chase are the ' complainants,
and they charge William McNevin, Harry
McNeviri, John Doe Kenny and John Doe
with battery.
Brady and Chase say they were led
into a trap, ambushed and trampled r un
der foot by. an irregular force, composed
of at least twenty men. The McNevins
say the retainers fought under the other
banner, and that they themselves waded
through a hollow square before . they
reached the oculist and the dentist.
Dr. Brady says he fought three men to
a standstill, but when he found he was
pitted against half a score he decided it
was not the part of valor to stand still
any longer, and so discreetly took to his
heels. The McNevin version is that he
beat the starter's flag and sprinted down-
Stockton- street like a 100-to-l shot trying
to win a race in the first quarter. They
say he ran so fast that he fell down..
The oculist admits that he^ran, but says
lm was only going after his gun' and
forty rounds of ammunition. When he
returned the armies had dispersed;; Â¦
"They came at us out of the bushes
on all sides, like Indians from ambush,
Dr. Chase, the dentis*. says. -"After. Dr..
Brady got away they ' all attacked me,
1 was knocked. down and- kicked about
like a football. They were thick all
around me. Some of them said, 'Get up
and fight us.' I said. Til not get up un
less you agree to fight me one at a time.
1 can whip that big ruffian there v/ho
kicked me in the. face.' Â¦ ;-
