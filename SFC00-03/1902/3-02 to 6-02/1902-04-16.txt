PLATFORM OF THE STATE LEAGUE OF REPUBLICAN CLUBS
Discussing the financial prospects of
South Africa, the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Tsaid both the Transvaal and
Orange River colonies would be able to
share In the cost of the war. He could
not announce the amount definitely, but
he believed that within a few years cer
tain sources of revenue, representing cap
ital of the value of Â£30,000,000, would be
set aside for this purpose.
Regarding the reports of differences be
tween himself and the Colonial Secretary,
Joseph Chamberlain, : the Chancellor of
the Exchequer admitted they had a little
difference, of opinion. He thought the
Colonial Secretary was more sanguine and
more anxious than himself to make a
charge upon the Transvaal. Yet it could
not be supposed that the Chancellor of
the Exchequer was backward in a mat
ter of this kind.
Sir Michael, in answer to a question,
said a rebate would not be allowed on
forward grain contracts, as was allowed
in the case of coal contracts last year.
The Chancellor added tnat he could not
say on the spur of the moment whether
the term "grain" included haricot beans,
peas, somolonia, etc., but he was inclined
to. think they were Included In that
term. , \ -
ARE GOLDEN DREAMS.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt (Liberal)
characterized Sir Michael HIcks-Beach'3
expectation of Transvaal revenue as
"golden dream3." useful only for float
ing fresh mining companies. The speaker
declared , the Government lacked the
moral courage to put the war tax on the
present generation who were responsible
for the war, and purposed to lay. the bur
den on' posterity.
The resolution providing for a loan of
Â£32,000,000 was adopted by 229 to 13 votes.
' .The loan Is to be raised by an issue of
2% per cent consols.
The Standard announces In a financial
SHARING COST OP WAR.
The . Government leader, A.' J. Balfour,
replying to a question in the House of
Commons yesterday, announced that the
Ministers had no information to impart
on the subject of the South African peace
negotiations, nor, under the circum
stances, could any Information be impart
ed at the present stage of the negotia
tions. The Government, Balfour added,
would immediately inform â¢ Parliament of
the fact when it had any news to com
municate.
During the course of the debate on the
resolution authorizing the loan of Â£32,000,
000 as announced when the budget was
presented, the Chancellor of the Excheq
uer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, said the
grant for the relief of the West Indies,
pending the operation of the provisions
of the Brussels sugar conference, would
probably not exceed Â£250,000, but assist
ance was necessary If the sugar producers
were to- be saved from absolute ruln.j
The following dispatch, dated Pretoria,
April 15, has been received at the War Of- "
rice from Lord Kitchener: "Bruce Ham
ilton's columns arrived at the Standerton
line last, night, having taken 145 Boers,
including killed and wounded, during the
movement from the MIddleburg line."
FIGHTING IS KEPT T7P.
Despite this, however, it is not expected
the refusal will cause the withdrawal of
the Boer leaders from the conference.
There Is another and more serious matter
which has produced what threatens to
form an obstacle to any further negotia
tion. If not a complete deadlock. This 13
the question of amnesty and the banish
ment proclamation. The Boer terms raise
two points which it seems the Cabinet
declined to accept. The instructions sent
to Lord Milner do not, it would seem,
place later Cape rebels on the same foot-
Ing as the Burghers as regards an am
nesty, nor Is there any apparent official
inclination to withdraw the banishment
proclamations.' The situation, therefore,
no< longer inspires the same confidence as
to a satisfactory issue of the negotiations
which was felt a few days ago. A very
short time will prove whether there Is any
way out of the difficulty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. April 16.â A serious hitch, the
Dally Mail understands, has arisen in con
nection with the peace proposals. - The
Cabinet, at its meeting yesterday, from
which only- Earl Cadogan and Lord Ash
bourne were absent, considered a strong
request by the Boer leaders at Pretoria
for an armistice during the progress of
the negotiations. This was absolutely re
fused, and, In the opinion of all conver
sant with the circumstances, rightly so.
It was not, there is reason to 'believe,
supported by any of his Majesty's ad
visers.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, April 15.-The recent
revelations regarding the . manner in
which war has been conducted in the
Philippines have stirred President Roose
velt to action. It is authoritatively an
nounced that the President will appoint
a commission to investigate the manner
in which the American army Is conduct
ing matters in these islands. The com
mission will represent the President per
sonally, and after a thorough sifting of
facts will report to him. The announce
ment of this commission will ' be made
as soon as the President can decide upon
its personnel.
Roosevelt feels that he should exercise
the greatest care In the selec
tion of the men who compose
it. and he now has several names
t:nder consideration- It Is stated
the commission will in no wise represent
the War Department. The President's
friends are careful to say he does not
contemplate any cessation In the prose
cution of the war. but he Intends to as
certain beyond any doubt whether the
war is being conducted according to the
customs of civilized warfare.
The President is not satisfied with the"
verdict in the Waller court-martial. He
also wants to know more concerning the
orders i^iven by General Sir.ith to Major
Waller before the expedition started. The
recent developments concerning, the ap
plication of the "water cure" have stirred
up his anger, and severe punishment may
be expected by officers who have resorted
to it should the commission find that the
facts warrant such action.
TO FIX RESPONSIBILITY.
As a result cf the consideration by the
Cabinet to-day of the charges of cruel
treatment of Filipinos by United States
soldiers. Secretary Root has made public
the following correspondence:
WAR DEPARTMENT. WASHINGTON.
"April 13, 1902. â My Dear Senator: I bee to ac

"On February ID a letter was tent you In
closing, for lm-estigatlon, a copy of charges
tnafle by Governor Gardener of Tayabas Pro
vince, which contained general allegations of
cruelties practiced by troops on natives, and
generally of an insolent, brutal attitude of the
errr.v toward natives. On April 2 a cable dis
patch was sent yea urging action with all
ep*ed consistent with thorough and searching
Investigation. On the 4th of March a cable
dispatch was sent you directing disciplinary

and instructing you to relieve Major Edwin E.

SAN JOSE, April 13.â Police i Captain
Thomas Vance, a peace officer of this city
for more than thirty years and now up
ward of 76 years of age. suffered a stroke
of paralysis to-day, affecting his left side
so as to- incapacitate him -from walking.
His physician believes he will rally.
"WASHINGTON, April 15.â As Com
mander Beehler, the United States naval
attache at Berlin. Vienna and Rome, will
not be recalled to the United States until
next fall, the Navy Department has not
found it necessary to maEe the formal
order detailing his successor as naval at
tache, and this order probably will be de
layed until late In the summer. As has
been stated before, the Navy Department
has contemplated the assignment of Lieu
tenant Commander Templin Potts, now
on duty at Annapolis, to this foreign
service.
Just a year ago, Mr. Potts, hearing
that Commander Beehler was soon to be
relieved, made application for the as
signment, and as he was the first to ap
ply and was otherwise fitted for the ser
vice desired, he was slated for the place.
All of this antedated the Schley court of
inquiry, at which Mr. Potts was a wit
ness, by nearly half a year; in fact, the
court was not then In contemplation. It
Is said at the department that nothing is
known of any intention to change the
plans relative to the successor to Com
mander Beehler. though, of course, the
formal order not having been made a
change could be easily effected.
It was stated at the Navy Department,
however, that while there might be some
delay in relieving Commander Beehler,
owing to the importance of the work he
has in hand and desires to finish, when
he is retired it will be by Lieutenant
Commander Potts, in accordance with the
custom of the department.
FOTTS TO SUCCEED
COMMANDER BEEHLEB
theless it is a fact that Alden Anderson
was hoodwinked by Dibble and Johnson
into appointing a majority of Gagelinja
to the committee on resolutions.
The weakness of the Governor's sup
porters was manifest when the blanket
resolution, commending him and the other
State officials, was read to the convention.
A bunch of forty or liity State office hold
ers shouted, but four-nfths of the dele
gate body made no sign of approval. Tha
hearty demonstrations of applause whichi
greeted Preston, Pardee and Edson when
they appeared before the convention made
it plain that the Indifference to the Gaga
resolution was studied. Â¦ .
One of Governor Gage's close ' political
friends gave out the intimation to-night
to several delegates from Southern Cali
fornia that the Governor was no longer
allied with Burnsâ that all political obli
gatjpns to the latter had been paid. ThÂ©
Governor's closest friends are now telling
him that his fellowship with Burns is tha
chief cause of his unpopularity. Develop
ments within the next week or so will
demonstrate that Gage is not the only
letter writer in the boss camp. Colonel
Burns has taken up the pen.
The henchmon of Gage are deeply cha
grined that the Governor has entered tnÂ»
list of letter writers. One of hi3 most
trusted supporters said to-night:
"Had I seen the letter before It was
read to the convention I would have bluo
penciled the allusion to other aspirants.
The letter has made him a lot of ene
mies."
The absurdity of the Gage allusion to
aspirants influencing the convention by
their presence is glaring when it is con
sidered in the light of the* known fact
that fifty or more State ofHce holders ap
pointed as delegates to shout for the GovÂ»
ernor came to the convention early and)
remained until adjournment.
ment, which he insisted was an Insult : to
Congressman Loud, the representative
from the Fifth District. Continuing, he
said: ... " t
\_ThIs convention should , not be used, by any
man or party of men to attack Congressman
Loud in his absence. We have no right to take
up this matter at this time, nor is it proper to
attack a man who has not the opportunity of
-defending himself . before this convention. ; I
hope you will vote this amendment down.
,, A delegate arose in the rear of the hall
and yelled that the amendment was no
attack upon Loud or anybody else. It
was merely, designed to be an expres
sion of the opinion of California Repub
licans that the letter-carriers should have
better pay. \ - '
Martin. Kelly said that the Republican
Alliance, to the number of 2000 good, hon
est and sincere Republicans, heartily in
dorsed "Wolfe's resolution, and demanded
its adoption by the convention.
Dozens of delegates sought to obtain a
hearing. . George W. Lewis heartily in
dorsed the. amendment, but he was in
terrupted by a call to order, and In a
temporaryUull Chairman Hale of the res
olution committee explained that Wolfe's
resolution was not shelved without ample
reason for that step. He said:
.â¢"We were presented with the copy of an ex
ecutive order, signed by President Roosevelt,
in March directing that all letter-carriers or
other Federal employes who , participated in
legislation of any description with a view. to
the increase of their salaries shall be liable to
dismissal from the public service. We thought
it best under the- circumstances to lay the letter
carrier resolution on the table and that action
was accordingly taken.
Hale's explanation served to add fuel
to the flames " rather than to quell the
ifires of opposition which were beginning
to. kindle in every direction." Lincoln Sav
age of San . Francisco shouted that the
convention was a gathering of Repub
licans, every one of whom was a free
agent, capable of and willing to perform
his own sweet will. He continued: :
I want to say Â¦ there ' are no strings on - me.
President Roosevelt or any act" Of his does not
influence any act of mine as a delegate in this
convention. The Republican party of Califor
nia is the . friend of the worktngmen, and we,
as its representatives, should' not ignore the
claims of the letter-carriers f<?r our support.
,The Republican â¢ Primary League Is In sym
pathy with this movement and I hope you will
carry this amendment. * . ; , . .

extracting gold from base ores 1 has been
developed by.: : WilliamL. Long of Salem,
Or. After years of, effort he has perfected
his .process and - lately has given a prac
tical demonstration ; of Its success. V-l
quantity; of , ore from -the Darnell
mine atiKalama was taken to Salem last
week and put through the. process. It
yielded: gold atthe rate 'Of over $60 per
ton, which is ' three ' times as much -as
has been taken out of the same kind of
ore by '.smelting. ... ,. . Â¦
- .Briefly 'Stated, Long's process separates
,the : gold, from ", the fore, which " is put
through various j solutions after crushing.
After, settling twelve hours: the liquid is
Bkimmed like cream, the gold being taken
off the -top,- where 2 it- has risen like .a

ed that the convention was independent
and that every delegate should have the
right to express himself as he might seeÂ«

Assemblyman Brown of San Mateo on
gaining recognition said, he never thought
it possible that the time would ever come

right of a convention of the kind now In

disputed. He declared it was absurd to
say that Wolfe's amendment? was an in

that the amendment be adopted and the
efforts of the letter-carriers for their own
advancement be thereby officially recog
nized. .
There is no telling how long the discus

PLATFORM IS PRESENTED.
At this juncture President Anderson
was informed that the committee on reso
lutions was ready to submit its report to
the convention. The announcement was
received in silence and the delegates set
tled back in their seats, each recognizing
that the momentous hour had arrived.
Much depended upon . the character and
scope of the .report, which, if adopted,
bound the party unalterably to the set of
principles it espoused. A deep hush fell
upon Â¦ the crowded hall when - O. A." Hale
advanced to -read the document. The in
dorsement of President xtoosevelt was
genuinely concurred in, but the mention of
Governor Gage's name fell with the ef
fect of a wet blanket upon the vast audi
ence. - â¢ - â¢
Scarcely had Hale finished the reading
of the resolutions and moved their adop
tion when Senator E. I.'. Wolfe of'- San
Francisco arose and asked to know- what
became of his resolution offered -yester
day, indorsing the Lodge bill now before
the Seriate, which provides for an increase
of the salaries of the letter-carriers. Be
fore Hale could reply Wolfe offered an
amendment that the resolution submitted
by him be made part of the original reso
lution. Wolfe resumed: . Â¦.
The Republican party of California must put
itself on record in this matter. We cannot af
ford to Ignore the claims of the wage-earners
of California to our consideration and exist
ence. Everybody knows that the letter-carriers
are the poorest paid employes of the Federal
Govarnment. The bill, which I hope" this con
vention ' will indorse, raises the salaries of
letter-carriers from $1000 to $1200 a year after
four years of service. Is that too much for any
working man who has a family to support' I
hope you will look at this In the proper light
and for the greater glory of the party do some
thing: to aid the letter-carriers in obtaining
better pay. .

WOMAN'S VOICE IS HEARD.
Mrs. Addie L. Ballou of San Francisco
was given three cheers when, after -her
introduction by the chairman, she ad
vanced to speak. She said she had heard
a great deal from the speakers in the con
vention about almost everything except
woman. What would the Republican
party be had it not been for the good Re
publican women who reared their chil
dren properly? Resuming, she said:
"Within the present century the recognition of
woman and her rights is bound to come. Many
gentlemen have said that they can't get along
without the women and I agree with them.
You can't get rid of us. (Laughter.) We have
ten women delegates here and we are going to
stay with you till the end. We are not looking
for office, either. (Laughter.) I was raised in
the school of politics. My first recollection of
the school was the sheltering by my father and
mother of a fugitive slave. That was an ex
perience which taught me that freedom in this
land of ours was at times a delusion and a
snare. I can"t make a speech because I am a
woman, and the mission of woman is only to
talk â to talk and to rock the cradle. (Laugh
ter.) But in that cradle we women will rock
the child of Republicanism; we women will
help you in every way to elect your candidates;
we women are with you, because, we think
your principles are right; we womaii of Cali
fornia, therefore, bid you godspeed^
EDSON AND PARDEE SyEAK.
E. B. Edson of Siskiyou delivered a
brief address. He said the Republicans
of California were full of charity for all
and malice toward none. He [believed
that the principles of the party would
prevail in November and he urged his
hearers to assist in securing the election
cf the Republican candidates that were
to be chosen by the convention.
George C. Pardee of Oakland was called
for, and on his appearance on the plat
form he was heartily cheered. He said
he had no apology to offer for being pres
ent at the convention, because it was his
duty as a Republican to assist by his
presence the party tp which he owed al
legiance. Continuing, he said:
I am proud to say that I am a Californtan,
and I am prouder to say that I regard Califor
nia as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
States of the Union. To-day California stands
nearer the center of the world's wealth, cul
ture and education than does any othe,r part of
God's footstool. We are on the eve of a cam
paign, and as our hoarse San Franciscans say,
we hail the nominee whomsoever he may be. It
Is our duty as true Republicans to work for the
cause of good government, as exemplified by the
principles of the Republican party at all times
and under all circumstances. Let us act in
harmony; let us work as a unit in the Interests
of our party and success is certain to be ours.
WIT ENLIVENS ORATORY.
General H. H. Pierce of Los Angeles
delivered a brief address. He said this
was no time for argument; it was a time
merely to resolve to accomplish things.
The highways and byways of our na
tional progress were marked by the
wrecks of Democratic ambitions and
hopes. In the speaker's judgment the
Republican party was ready now to take
the Democratic party. to the shambles in
November. The address â¢ was enlivened
by the relation of several anecdotes which
were provocative of laughter.
Thomas H. Selvage .of Humboldt said
if he were making the World he would be
gin with San Jose and Santa Clara Coun
ty iir.d make the rest to conform with the
beauty of the central setting. He would
then make a San Francisco, whither one
could go occasionally for a change of
diet. He would also make a Los Angeles,
but this reminded him that there was a
Kood deal of California lying north of
Tehachapl. He wanted the people of that
section to be satisfied with something less
than the whole of everything. He was
willing to give the capital to Sacramento,
but with it there should go- a natural
f.lter. The speaker closed with a humor
ous reference to the Democratic party,
â¢which he declared was a political corpse
that cculd never be revived.
COLORED DELEGATE TALKS.
Thomas Pearson of Oakland, a member
of the Afro- American League, said he
was proud of the Republican party be
cause it was through that party that the
inestimable privilege of American citizen
ship was conferred upon him. He paid
his respects to women and expressed the
conviction that they would soon receive
the right of suffrage for which they were
struggling. When that day arrived, there
would be no party that would defeat the
great Republican party, at the polls.
Pearson closed with a stirring apos
trophe to the members of the "Army and
Navy -League and when he concluded he
was cheered with genuine enthusiasm.
The secretary was Instructed to have
an engrossed copy of the McKinley me
morial resolutions sent to Mrs. McKin
ley, and also to telegraph a copy of the
resolutions adopted in reference to Chi
nese exclusion to the California delega
i.on in Congress. â¢
By a rising vote the convention adopted
a resolution of thanks to the citizens of
San Jose.. and at 3:30 o'clock the conven
tion adjourned.
â¢ One ot the most interesting contests
was that over the selection or six dele
gates to the National League :of Republi
can Clubs. Ferd K. Rule of Los Angeles
was named by General Pierce; George E.
de Golia, named Russell G. Lukens of
Alameda; Judge George H. Bahrs, as rep
resentative of the German-American Al
liance of San Francisco, nominated John
D. Spreckels: H. C. - Dibble placed the
name of M. H. de Young before the con-,
vention; Judge A. G. Burnett of Santa
Rosa and S. C. Rogers of San Francisco,
the fatter a member of the Afro-Ameri
can League, were nominated. The vote
of the convention was cast for these six
men. A delegate from the Republican
Mutual Alliance brought the name of Col
onel J. C. Giesting before the convention,
but withdrew it as soon as he was in
formed that six names had already been
presented.
Some of the nominating and seconding
speeches were of a high order, particu
larly that of Judge Bahrs in presenting
the name of John D. Spreckels. His
speech won a great round of applause.
1 he executive committee of the State
League will select the alternates, if neces
sary, prior to the meeting of the conven
tion.
Two committees of nine members each
will be appointed by Chairman Anderson
to carry out the recommendations made
in his report. - . Â». .
General H. H. Pierce of Los Angeles, on
"behalf of 8000 veterans in the Army and
Navy League and 25,000 other veterans,"
named Major Andrew G. Myers of Siskl
you for vice president. Grove L. John
son, in a speech in which he said young
men should be at the head of the league,
aroused considerable indignation. He
named Judgff A. G. Burnett-, of Santa
Rosa, but Burnett graciously declined the
honor, and the nomination of Myers was
made by acclamation.
D. E. Gosper named S. E. Crow of Santa
Barbara for second vice president, and
he had no opposition.

The election of officers for the coming

Delegates from all parts of the nail, rep

TBIBUTE TO THE MAKTYE.
When Dr. Pardue of Oakland, chairman
of the committee on memorial to Presi
dent McKinley, advanced to present his
report, he was given an ovation. When
the enthusiasm subsided he read the fol
lowing brief memorial, which was adopted
without a dissenting voice: '
Since the last convention of the California
State League of Republican Clubs it has been
the will of God. in his infinite wisdom, to
plunge this great nation into deepest grief by
removing, at the hand of an assassin, tliat
errejtt soldier, statesman and President, William
McKinley. As a soldier, as a statesman, as a
President, as a husband, as a man, and, .greater
than all. as an American citizen, his memory
is seated deep in the hearts of all Americans,
without regard to color, religion or party.
Realizing all this, and feeling that words
cannot express the feelings that surge through
every American's soul at the mention of his
illustrious name, it is the heartfelt wish of
this gathering of Republicans to join- with their
fellow citizens in mourning their great loss,
and to sympathize with her whom he. In his
busy and eventful life, loved. so well.
ELOQUENCE OF SHORTBIDGE.
The committee on resolutions sent a
message announcing its inability to file its
report until later and President Anderson
announced that si>eeches would be in or
der. He called upon Samuel hi. Short
ridge for remarks and the mention of the
tall orators name was the signal for con
siderable cheering. Shortridge bowed his
thanks, smiled benignantly and then, said
he intended to remember the old maxim
that "brevity is wit." He launched with
out waste of time into the discussion of
his subject. He humorously referred to
the orange blossoms and peach groves of
the south- and to the orange bitters so
easily procured in San Jose. He paid Jiis
respects to the Army and Navy League
saying that the preservation of the na
tion was due to the veterans of the Civil
W ar.
The speaker alluded to the colored man.
The first blood of the revolution was shed
by a colored man, he said, and in the
late war the negro did much to preserve
the Union. Â»
The speaker dwelt with some eloquence
upon the aims of Republicanism, the
erand victories won by the party and the
brilliant hopes the future held forth It
was the Republican party that had ma
tured the greatest nation of the world
and through that party the American na
tion was destined to accomplish even
greater things than those which brighten
the pages of its history of the past forty
years.
COLONEL PEESTON'S TALK.
Colonel E. P. Preston i*ext addressed
the convention in a happy vein. He said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the State
League of Republican Clubs: I am in the
position before you that my friend Brusie de
picted yesterday afternoon. He eaid that he
needed the stimulus of an emergency to enable
him to talk. There being no emergency he
proceeded to make a very happy speech, con
tradicting himself and establishing a paradox;
but what can a man say to you after the
orations and speeches to which you have
listened ?
This audience, the gathering that I see of
Republicans, the harmonious intent and the
evident disposition to place the party upon
a solid platform during the approaching con
test are evidence to me of the power and
propriety of such an organization as this.
You come here saturated with Republicanism,
which has been injected into you at every pore
since you have been here, and there is little
if anything that I could add or say about
Republicanism or the republic that would be
new or that would perhaps interest you.
We do feel, all of us, that the Republican,
party is the creative party of men and prin
ciples in this United States of America. (Ap
plause.) We feel that "whether it is the
emancipation of slavery or whether It is the
emancipation of Cuba the Republican party
has always gone to the front with the as
sertion of the principle and the courage to
carry it to a successful conclusion. In look
ing through the names of the men that are
writ upon the walls of the temple in words
of flame it is the Republican party that placed
there the name of Abraham Lincoln of
Ulysses S. Grant and of William McKinley.
It was the Republican party that, after that
sectional strife when the blue and the gray
met upon the battle field, I say again it was
the Republican party that placed the stars of
the major general upon Fitzhugh Lee's shoul
ders, upon the shoulders of General Wheeler,
cemented in one common mass these United
States of America, that all the world might
bow with us. (Applause.)
Gentlemen, this republic can never retreat
in its policy; It must always advance â advance
In the cause of humanity; advance in the cause
of statesmanship, and it must advance in the
cause of self-preservation. A Jeffersonian
Democrat of the day of Jefferson knew nothing
of the wants of a modern battleship; a Dem
ocrat of the day of Jefferson knew nothing
about the necessities of a manufacturing com
munity in these United States that required an
,open door for our trade in China or India, or
wherever we may want to s"nd our eoods. A
Democrat of the day of Jefferson knew noth
ing about a world tir.elingr with electricity and
sparkling with electric lights and the intel
ligence of the masses raised from the ground.

"If you can discover any witnesses still In
the service in the Philippines who can testify
in support of the charges, or If Major Glenn
desires the attendance of any persons now
serving In the islands as witnesses for the de
fense, you will direct them to proceed to San
Francisco for that purpose. As the two years
allowed for the prosecution by the statute of
limitations is nearly at an end, no time is to
bÂ« lost. You will take such course In advanc
ing or postponing the Investigations previously
ordered into the conduct of General Smith and
Major Glenn as shall be required to enable
you to execute these Instructions. It Is believed
that the violations of law and humanity, of
which these cases. If true, are examples, will
prove to be few and occasional, and not to
characterize the conduct of the army general
ly in the Philippines; but the fact that any
such acts cf cruelty and barbarity appear to .
have been done Indicates the necessity . of a
most thorough, searching and exhaustive In
vestigation Into the general charges preferred
by Governor Gardener, and you will spare no
effort, in the investigation already . ordered
under theee charges, to uncover every such case
which may have occurred and bring the of
fenders to justice."
The President desires to know In the fullest
and most circumstantial manner all the facts,
nothing being ccncealed and no man being for
any reason favored or shielded. For the very
reason that the President intends to back up
the army in the heartiest fashion in every law
ful and legitimate method of doing its work, he
also intends to see that the most rigorous care
Is exercised to detect and prevent any cruelty
or brutality and that men who are guilty there
of are punished.
Great as the provocation has been In deal
ing with foes who habitually resort to treach
ery, murder and torture against our men,
nothing can justify or will be held to Justify
the use of torture or inhuman conduct of any
kind on the part of the American army.
ELIHU HOOT,
April 13, 1802. Secretary of War.-
form o* torture known as the 'water cure' was
administered to the presidente of the town of

Glenn, then captain of the Twenty-fifth In
fantry, and that Captain and Assistant Surgeon
Palmer Lyon, at that time a contract surgeon,
was present to assist them. The officers
named, or such of them as are found to be
responsible for the act. will be tried therefor
by court-martial. Conger and Lyon are in this
country. Both the Twenty-sixth Volunteer- In
lantry and Eighteenth Infantry having return
ed to the United States and most of the wit
nesses being presumptively here, the Secretary
of AVar directs that Major E. F. Glenn. Twen
ty-fifth Infantry, be directed to proceed to San
Francisco and report to the seneral command
ing the Department of California, with a -view
to his trial by court-martial under charges al
l*-Â£ing the cruelties practiced by him upon a
native of the Philippine Islands at Igbarras,
oa the 27th of June. 1900.

SACRAMENTO, April . 15.â Mrs. Emily
York was burned to death, at her home,
1525 E street, this afternoon while en
gaged in cleaning furniture with gaso
line. It appears that she filled a sprink
ling pot with the fluid and that a candle
which she had lighted to aid her; in the
work ignited the vapor and caused an ex
plosion. v . . :
A terrific report was heard in the neigh
borhood, and in a moment Mrs. -York ap
peared at a second-story window en
veloped in flames. She threw herself from
the window, and when picked up was
dead, her body being horribly scarred
from the fire. The house was saved from
destruction with great difficulty. Â¦ . . . .
Only last Thursday Mrs. Florence
Wagener died in this city as the result of
a somewhat similar accident. Her hus-'
band had been called away from home
temporarily, and M?s. Wagener sought to
pass away the time untih his return by
cleaning some gloves with gasoline. She
carried a lighted candle into the bath
room and had begun to use the gasoline
when the blaze from the candle struck
the fumes. In a minute Mrs. Wagener
was covered with flames. She lingered m
agony until the next morning, when she
died.

else was saved. The fire hose had been
cut. The loss is $5500. with no insurance

Among the projectors of this gigantic
enterprise are the following well-known
residents of Los Angeles^ Edwin T.-E&rl,
founder of the Earl Fruit Company; Sam
uel H. Day, dealer in real estate; J. M.
Howells and James D. Schuyler, consulting
hydraulic engineers, of San Francisco; ex-
Senator Guy C. Earl of Alameda County,
and George P. Batchelder, vice president
of the banking firm of E. K. Rollins &
Son of San Francisco. This great project
represents a movement in sympathy with
the larger effort now being put forth in
San Francisco and the interior to obtain
new men and new capital for the devel
opment of the splendid resources of
Northern California.
In addition to developing the mining
and lumber interests of this mountain
region, as well as other industries along
the route, this power will be carried to
San Francisco, a distance of 175 miles.
A large herd of fine cattle will be pas
tured during the coming- season upon the
lands acquired.
Here will be located the largest
electrical transmission plant in the
United States, save that of Ni
agara, and capable of generating up
ward of 300,000 horsepower. The Big
Meadows Basin of 11,000 acres will have
the greatest capacity of any artificial
storage reservoir known,- and will- im
pound about 50 per cent of the freshet
waters of the. North Fork of the Feather
emptying into it.
It has now become known that it is
Intended to convert these basins Into
great storage reservoirs and by about ten
miles of canal and tunnel to convey 100,
000 inches of water to the canyon of
Mosquito Creek, where, with a vertical
fall of 1600 feet. It will be dropped again
into the Feather.

Brehlow, feeling that he was responsi
ble for the plight in which the young lady
Â¦was placed, jumped into the falls, re
solved to go for help. But he got only
as far as the next falls and then had to
return. He had been dressed in duck
trousers and summer coat and was now
wet from head to feet. All night the four
stayed in the cavern, until at about S
o'clock on Sunday morning the rescuing
party found them and they were drawn
forth from the prison by means of a rope
and tackle.
Finally Bazata and B.lackbura, who
Â¦were searching for the lost ones, located
them and managed to reach their prison.
But in the darkness no one could get back
to safety. The rescuers were just as much
prisoners as those they had intended to
save. It is cold in the mountains at this
time of the year and the party had no
food for a prolonged stay. Bazata had
two matches, but he lost them, in trying
to light his pipe.
A tally-ho party of youns people left
Alhambra, a suburb of this city.. In the
morning to spend the day picnicking in
Eaton Canyon, about six miles northeast
of here. During the afternoon Miss de
Camp and young Brehlow strolled up the
canyon. Miss de Camp is noted for her
daring and when her escort dared her to
climb down to a cave near the falls she
accepted the challenge. He climbed down
first and landed safely. The descent was
made by crawling along a slender limb
of an overhanging tree. The young lady
descended and just as she was about to
reachV he landing place the limb broke.
The breaking of the limx> removed the
means of leaving the place, for the rocks
were too smooth and steep to climb and
the falls were below. The couple shouted
in vain for help. The roar of the falls
drowned their voices.
PASADENA, April 15.â Four Alhambra
society young people were Imprisoned In
a mountain cave all Saturday night and
a portion of Sunday. They were Miss
Madge de Camp, Roscoe Brehlow. Charles
Bazata and Dura Blackburn- The episode
was a most exciting one and most dis
agreeable for the time being.

i> P. Rasch, a prospector, arrived at Wel
ser this evening from Thunder Mountain.
He reports a discovery on the very sum
mit of Rainbow Mountain. At a point
where the snow had. been blown off he
dug gold in ledges in the crevices of the
rock. He panned a lot of it. It averaged
$1 50 a pan. He made locations and left
to get provisions. He brought gold with
him, also boulder-like quartz that is
thickly set with gold.
I "We advised every outfit we met to go
back," said Venable, "but they seemed. to
think-we were ,trying to keep them out so
as to give our friends who are there an
advantage in making locations and they
pressed on all the faster. It is simply
Idiocy, to go in there. All the money tnat
can be made by the people unacquainted
with the country and the conditions In the
next six weeks would not compensate
them for the terrible experiences. Still,
the trails are crowded. We counted more
men going in than there were in the camp
when we left."
; , Reports have reached here of men eat
ing horse and mule flesh, but Benjamin
and \ Venable could not confirm this, . al
though l they said it would not surprise
them if such were the case. They say the
district is a marvel of richness and that it
is an easy mater to' take out big wages
with ordinary rockers, if a miner is pre
pared to withstand the rigors of the awful
climate of this section. The wildness of
it is almost impossible to describe. Ground
will v be broken at once for several large
mills and -before the next winter sets in
they, say. in the neighborhood of 400
stamps will be dropping there.
. "The trails are strewn with dead pack
horses," said Benjamin. "The animals
gave.. out and were shot. People who have
rushed -to, the gold fields, in many cases
taking only enough provisions on their
backs or on sledges, to last them a few
weeks, have almost starved and some of
them will starve if fresh supplies are not
got' in soon." ? -/ 'A - .
Thousands of dollars have been expend
ed to get pack animals loaded with pro
visions into the camp, but so far only one
outfit has got through. The provisions
are sold readily for 75 cents a pound
straight through,' with the exception of
flour, which went for $50 to $80 a sack.
They came out; over the trail In five and
a half ' days, , being forced . to., leave the
fields on account- of a'shortage of provi
sions ; and ,the - constant ..: demands made
upon : them"' by; destitute . prospectors, who
rushed in over the snow, trails in the dead
of winter. The situation. in that respect is
decidedly alarming. Benjamin and Ven
able say the trails, are in a terrible con
dition now on account of the snow melt
ing. It is highly dangerous to go at this
time, and they advise no one to attempt
the trip inside of a month. In fact, they
state, It. would -be impossible " to get in
enough-'provisions to fully supply tne de
mand before the middle of June. -."'
BOISE, Idaho,; April 15.â Prank C. Ben
jamin and Joseph â¢ J. Venable have re
turned from the Thunder Mountain gold
fields. They, '.were -Â¦ members of a party
that went in .Â¦ last- fall. Â¦ They located a
number of - claims and did considerable
work. One group of claims in which they
are interested was. recently sold for $60,000,

About two years ago I had a very severe case of kidney and bladder trouble.
The pain In the small of my back was so severe that I could not stand It to stay
in one position more than a moment or two, and was obliged to pass water very
often day and night. I tried medicines and doctors without getting- relief. Noticing
an advertisement in the Topeka State Journal of Swamp-Root, I determined to
give it a trial, and bought a bottle. By the time I had finished the first bottle the
pain had entirely disappeared from my back. The pain and frequent desire to
pass water ceased. - However, I continued to take the medicine, using about six
bottles in all. That was over a year ago, and I have had no return of the trouble
since.' Â¦ Â¦*> Â¦ * " Â¦

The Central Labor Council of Cincinnati de
rles that Senator Foraker, in his speech be
fore the United States Senate on the Chinese
exclusion bill expressed the sentiment' of the
laboring people. Senator Foraker has been a
reliable representative of the capitalistic class
and his views are based on the Interests of that
class and opposed to those of labor.
CINCINNATI, April 15.â The Central
Labor Council, representing all branches
of organized labor in Cincinnati, to-night
passed the following resolution:
Labor Unions Score Foraker.
We sincerely trust that this - petition, em
bodying our best Judgment, may meet with
your favorable consideration and that you may
hono>- us by presenting the same to the Senate
In session.
Retolved, That we are firmly convinced that
the Mitchell-Kahn bill as reported from the
Committee on Immigration and passed by the
House of Representatives is the only exclusion
bill that will exclude now before Congress, and
we therefore urge all true friends of the policy
of the exclusion of Chinese laborers from the
United States" to vote for this bill and to de
feat any amendment offered thereto' tending to
weaken it in any of its essential or effective
features.
Resolved, By the executive council of the
American Federation of Labor in session as
sembled that we hold said Proctor bill and
Platt amendment utterly inadequate and con
trary to the best interests of labor all over
the country, in the mills of . New England or
the Carolina*, as well as to the workmen on
the Pacific Coast and inter-mountain States;
and further
Whereas, Seamen are clearly entitled to every
protection from Chinese competition as are
other workers in our common country; and
Whereas. The validity of the entire Scott
act of 1SSS is in controversy in an appeal case
now pending before the Supreme Court and It
is generally admitted that the attack will be
sustained by the court, neither the Proctor bill
nor the Platt amendment dealing in any way
with these new questions or the emergency
â¢which will beyond doubt arise by the court's
decision;
. .Whereas. Any law which does not define the
meaning- to be given to terms official, teacher,
student, merchant and traveler would, in view
of Chinese duplicity, be a mockery an<L/6r no
value; and
"Whereas, The .Philippines, with their large
Chinese population of the pnre and mixed blood
and their proximity to China, serve and could
to a greater degree serve.' as a reservoir of
Chinese laborers and a bridge over which
Chinese could and would come to the main
lend territory of the United States unless stop
ped by effective legislation; and
It may be unnecessary to indicate how deep
ly interested are the men and women of our
country whom we have the honor to represent
in the matter of this legislation and desirous
of serving them, as well as all people of- our
country to the very best of our ability, we
have adopted the following- preamble and reso-.
lutlons :
WASHINGTON, April ; 15.â The execu
tive council of the American Federation
of Labor to-day discussed at length the
status of the Chinese exclusion bill,
which has passed the House and is now
pending before the Senate. A letter was
framed and presented to Senator Frye,
president pro tern, of the Senate. The
letter says:
Labor on Exclusion.
Stand of American Federation of
FAVORS THE KAHN BILL.
There was also a mass of other tele
grams from the cities of the Pacific Coast
urging the passage of the Platt substi
tute re-enacting the Geary law. Many of
the dispatches expressed the opinion that
the Geary law had been amply sufficient
for the protection of American interests,
and that the pending bill is too severe.
Perkins of California submitted a large
number of dispatches supporting the bill.
One of the telegrams was from the Mayor
and- Board of Supervisors, or legislative
body, of San Francisco, declaring that
the opposition of the Chamber of Com
merce did not represent the position of
the people of the Pacific Coast, who
askeja for the passage of the Senate bill.
Gallinger read a number of telegrams
referring to the bill. One of these was
from a number of attorneys of San Fran
cisco replying to an allegation by Chi
nese Inspector Dunn, when before the
Senate Committee on Immigration, to
the effect that many attorneys use unfair
means In promoting the interests of their
clients. The attorneys assumed that the
testimony was directed a't themselves or
some of them, and say If it was that the
charge was "false and malicious." They
call upon him to give names.
"WASHINGTON, April 15.â The debate
on the Chinese exclusion bill was prac
tically concluded to-day, and . voting on
the bill and amendments will begin at 10
o'clock to-morrow. By general consent a
vote was taken to-day on two important
amendments offered by Fairbanks of In
diana, striking out the definition as to
Chinese students and teachers, and they
were agreed to without division. These
changes were made with a view to recon
ciling some of the opposition to the meas
ure which has been directed against the
rigid restrictions on students and teach
ers and the unnecessary Inconvenience this
would impose on the. educated Chinese
classes coming to this country. The de
bate was participated In by Senator Helt
feld of Idaho, Senator Penrose of Pennsyl
vania and Turner of Washington in favor
of the bill and Senator Pritchard of North
Carolina and Spooner of Wisconsin in op
position.
Turner made the assertion that politics
had crept into, the discussion, and that
most of the Senators of the majority were
opposed to the bill. This brought out a
sharp rejoinder from Spooner, who main
tained that politics had not figured in the
discussion, and that the opposition to
the present bill was due entirely to its
conflict with the treaty, and riot because
of any opposition to Chinese exclusionv
which was an established doctrine of the
Government.

transactions in this stock alone reached a
total of over 353.000 shares. By noon more
than a half million shares had changed
hands. Dealings fell off after, that to
some extent, but the records for the num
ber of shares of a single stock sold in one
hour, in two hours and In one day's trad
ing were all shattered as a result of
Southern Railway's performance to-day.
The sales for the day reached a to
tal of 864,500 shares. The total outstand
ing stock of the company Is 1,2)0,000
shares. President Spencer, when asked
as to the future relations of Southern and
Louisville and Xashville, made this state
ment:
In the first half hour fully 200,000 shares
of Southern Railway common changed
hands. By the end of the first hour the
This statement was later changed so
that it read: "We have bought control,"
etc. The correction was made by John F.
Harris, who had Just paid a second visit
to the Morgan banking-house.
Belmont made another hurried visit to
Morgan & Co. soon after the Gates state
ment was issued. He declined to say any
thing, as did the Morgan representatives.
Perkins, who had been most active In the
preliminary negotiations, seemed at first
disposed to say something dealing with
the terms arranged between the Gates
and Belmont factions. He changed his
mind, however, and announced that some
definite declaration would be made by the
arbiters late in the afternoon. When that
time came Perkins decided to withhold
the Morgan statement until late at night.
Belmont on hearing of this decided to
withhold anything he might have for pub
lication until the Morgan statement had
been Issued. Perkins and Belmont were
in conference late in the afternoon, and
both said that formal declarations would
be sent out by them before midnight.
Throughout the day operations In South
ern Railway shares continued on an enor
mous scale. The demand was extraor
inary almost from the outset. The com
mon stock advanced 3% and the preferred
3% points. Blocks of 5000 and 10.0UO shares
were common, and there was one string
of 30,000 shares and another of 37,000
while the trading was at its height. Much
of the early buying was attributed to
Morgan influence, but it soon became
clear that the Gates clique, as well as the
room traders generally, were taking a
hand in the game.
NEW YORK, April 15.â Wall street
passed through one of its most exciting
and sensational periods to-dav. The
Louisville and Nashville situation, which
had hung menacingly over the district for
a. week or more, was cleared by the un
disputed statement that John W. Gates
and his associates had wrested control of
the property from the Belmont party and
were in absolute possession. Accompany
ing this statement, whicn had been dis
counted the day before, was one that the
Gates faction had selected J. P. Morgan.
& Co. to settle the differences between
the contending interests.
While these events were happening a
movement without parallel in the history
of the Stock Exchange was on in South
ern Railway. Trading in Southern Rail
way common set in on ii tremendous scale
and at one time Interest centered almost
entirely in that stock. It Became evident
before the opening of the market that a
settlement would be reached. At the of
fice of J. P. Morgan & Co. a series of
conferences were held before 10 o'clock.
Those present during the morning were
George W. Perkins and William P. Hamil
ton, representing the Morgan interests;
August Belmont, Samuel Spencer, presi
dent of the Southern Railway; Edward
Hawley, president of the Iowa Central
and Minneapolis and St. LÂ«ouis railroads;
John W. Gates, Talbot J. Taylor, head
of the brokerage firm of that name and
son-in-law of James R. Keene, and Fran
cis L,ynde Stetson, one of Morgan's at
tornej'S.
This conference broke up shortly before
11 o'clock. Gates was among the first to
leave and It soon became known that he
would issue a statement telling of a
peaceful solution of the matter. Shortly
before noon the appended announcement
was given out by the brokerage firm of
Harris Gates & Co., in which John W.
Gates is a special partner:
We have bought a large amount of stocTc of
the Louisville and Nashville road. "We did not
buy it for epeculatlon, but for Investment, be
lieving absolutely in the present and future
valu* 1 of the property. There will not be any
â¢â¢ccrncr" in the stock. We have placed the*
entire matter In the hands of J. P. Morgan &
Co. and requested them to act as arbitrators
of the situation because of the prominence of
the property and a desire not to disturb in
any manner the general market conditions, and
becfluco we know they illorgan & Co.) have
no Interest whatever in the property or in re
cent purchases.

the Action of the Attorney
Unsuccessful Effort Is Made
to Limit the General
Debate.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â With the
close of the Cuban reciprocity debate in
the House to-day, the leaders announced
that all danger of the bill being weighted
down with undesirable amendments was
over and that they felt assured the bill
would pass in the shape in which It came
from the committee. As -the bill in Its
present form is sure to command three
fourths of the vote on each side of the
House, its passage was certain If it suc
cessfully passed the stage when amend-,
ments could be offered. The only cause
of anxiety heretofore has been the possi
bility that enough Republicans would join I
with the Democrats to overrule the chair
and. tack onto the bill an armendment to
abolish the differential on refined sugar.
All the energies of the leaders have been
directed, therefore, to bringing pressure
to bear on the recalcitrant Republicans to
induce them to refrain from aiding this
plan, and this evening at the close of the
session it was announced that the entire
Republican delegations from Michigan
and California, who constitute the head
and front of the opposition, had agreed
not to vote to overrule the ruling of the
chair. ' Â«-
Watson of Indiana, who is acting as
the whip for the majority, does not be
lieve over a dozen Republicans at the
outside will join the Democrats in this
proposition. It would require more than
twenty Republican votes to replace on the
bill the amendment which might endan
ger its ultimate passage, as several Demo
crats, it is understood, also have declared
their intention to stand by the ruling of
the chair.
An unsuccessful effort was made again
to-day by Payne to secure an agreement
to limif'the general debate. When the
House adjourned to-day Â¦ there remained
thirty-five members who desire to speak.
The debate to-day was* without particular
interest. The speakers were Swanson of
Virginia and White of Kentucky for the
bill and S. W. Smith of Michigan, Day
ton of West Virginia, Burgess of Texas,
Meyer of Louisiana and Sutherland of
Utah against it.
House Makes Special Rule.
WASHINGTON, April 15.â The Commit
tee on Rules of. the House to-day decided
to report a special rule for the considera
tion of the Senate amendments to the
oleomargarin'e bill. The rule will simply
provide that the House shall go into com
mittee of the whole to consider the
amendments. No time limit will be placed
uponthe debate. The rule will not be re
ported until the Cuban reciprocity bill is
out of the way. The decision to report
the rule was reached by a party vote,
Speaker Henderson and â¢ Grosvenor and
Dalzell voting for! It and Richardson and
Underwood against it.
MinisterslOppose Ware.
TOPEKA, Kans.l April 15.â The friends
of Eugene Ware, recently appointed to
the office of Pension Commissioner, do
not ascribe much importance to the
charges about to be filed against him in
Washington. Ware is understood as hav
ing liberal views on religious matters.
The Ministerial Union of Topeka is con
sidering whether to oppose his confirma
tion on the ground that he is an agnos
tic. As. yet there has been no formal ac
tion taken' by the union. '. â¢
throughout the country are regulated,
other matters, such as dealings with
trade in different cities, blacklisting of
small dealers and matters of that sort,
being left to the local representatives and
to an arbitrator, as Is the case in New
York.
That in- order to deceive the public all
large packing-houses on the Missouri Riv
er, with the exception of Armour's, have
opened houses under other names, which
are blinds, and of the twenty packing

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STRET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, April 15.â For the
first "time" since the original charges
against the beef trust' were made official
announcement by Attorney General Knox
that an Investigation had been ordered
was 'made public to-day. This announce
ment was made in reply to a letter of in
quiry sent to Knox by Chairman Ray
of the House Committee on Judiciary,, to
which was referred resolution pre
sented by Representative Thayer of Masr
sachusetts. In view of the Attorney
General's letter and the important an
nounce^ment which It contained the com
mittee voted to report the resolution back
to the House to-morrow, with the recom
mendation "that -it : lay on the table.
In his letter Knox says: 1'It is proper,
-I-thin-k,- however, K to add that, owing to
the positive, oft-repeated and circum
stantial nature of the allegations that the
law is being flagrantly violated, I directed
some time ago a 'thorough investigation
to be made by one of the District Attor
neys of the United States for the purpose
of ascertaining in fact if such combina
tion existed, and whether, if so, its opera
tions were in. violation of any Federal
statute." '*
Thayer's present intention is .to get a
vote on the question of tabling the reso
lution when it is brought into the House
to-morrow.
'.Â». Complaint Is Hade. Â» ...
Formal complaint against illegal opera
tions of. the beef trust has been made to
the Department of Justice by officials ot
the Retail Butchers' and Meat Dealers'
Protective Association â¢â¢ of 'the United
States. Inconseqence, the Department of
Justice feels its hands greatly strength,
ened in Jts- search -for evidence that will
break up the combination and punish the
leading spirits for their oppression of the
public. The complaint was made by H.
G. Wagner of New York City, president,
and D. J. Healey, secretary of the Butch
ers' National Association, and by Charles
A: Daly, corresponding secretary of the
Washington local association.
Wagner and Healey, armed with many
facts, came to Washington yesterday. The
Attorney General gave them a long hear-'
ing and went fully into the case. He said
that the department had so far been act
ing on public information which was
known to all men. Until members of the
Butchers' Association had appeared no
.formal complaint had been received by
Â¦ the department.
: The facts, as they are coming out here,
show' that the Government at the proper
time will be able to show: Â¦. ' . -
That at the present time the beef trust
is paying the full published rate to the
railroads and. is getting, no concessions.
This is due to the fact that the railroads
have been enjoined .by . the Interstate
Commerce Commission. - Â¦ Â¦-:::-
That in order to make up for the Ios3
of these rebates, which amount to be
tween $3,000,000 . and $5,000,000 a year, the
trust has raised the price of meat all over
the country, making the .public pay what
it formerly wrung from the railroads to
get unfair competitive rates.
That the understanding between the
great packinghouses is of an ironclad
character and deals with all branches of
the business.- That the great headquar
ters- of -the "business is , in Chicago, and
from there all affairs of the trust ar^
managed. Â¦Â¦Â¦.'.Â¦....Â¦.-
Each Has an Agreement.
. That each of the various lines of busi

between the managers in that particular
line of the various houses In the combina

That these sub-combinations Include In
one beef. In another, provisions. In an
other oleomargarine, and In others vari
ous by-products, on which the trust
makes large amounts of money.
' That these managers hold their meet
ings at a given place in Chicago, and that
they fix prices and bind themselves to
maintain them by depositing a forfeit.

DULUTH, Minn., April 15.â Telephone
advices received' from Eveleth early, to
day, reported- the destruction by fire last
night of the City Jail, and the blowing
up of the Duluth, Mesaba and Northern
Railroad depot by burglars at that place.
In the jail fire an unknown prisoner was
burned to death. ';;
Several hours ' later burglars blew up
the depot safe. -They overestimated the
amount of nltro-glycerln needed and as
a result there was .a report that woke up
the entire town, shattering windows in the
houses for blocks around. When the cit
izens reached the scene of the explosion
the station lay in ruins and the debris
had *caught fire from the stove.
flames were extinguished and then an un-,
successful search was made for the safe.
It was too big to carry away and It Is
thought It must have been blown into
pieces too small to be located.
-Search; said that; the greatest need of
the organization was a' larger Income, and
he ; advocated the increase . of the annual
fee from ' $50 â¢ to Â» $100. . As a; means . of In
creasing the influence and prestige of the
association: Search suggested? the -holding
of :: semi-annual : conventions of manufac
turers and; merchants ; for the considera
tion : of special :. topics : . such,; for example,
as methods of extending export trade. He
also ' recommend ,the subdivision {of the
work; of the association among a number
of â¢ committees. '
-.- Concerning * isthmian " canal Â¦ projects
Search took ; the position that the people
really â¢ cared but little .whether the Pan
ama i or .the Nicaragua J route should be
chosen, - so long as some decisive action
should be taken by Congress which would
advance the matter to the- point of actual
undertaking of the construction of an in
teroceanic waterway.; â¢ ;- - - - .Â¦
The pending bills for the reorganization
of , the ; Consular service on practical lines
were recommended for approval : by ; the
association. ' The ! pending eight-hour bill
and the â¢"anti-Injunction' bill,"- Search
said, should not be permitted to become
laws without having been most carefully,
considered" in their bearing -on- manufac
turing ; Interests:;-' The appointment ;of :a
permanent * committee on \ interstate com
merce law was recommended as ' a means
of aiding the movement to secure desired
amendments of that act.'?gsP88&n9MM
. ; The principle of 'direct Government' aid
to the merchant â¢ marine, , as embodied- in
the c pending ship subsidy bill, was com
mended as in perfect accord with the; dec
larations of previous annual conventions."
Â¦ With regard to the proposition to create
a new.' Federal department "Search ex
pressed gratification at the progress that
had been made toward the passage of the
Nelson bill, and urged more energetic per
sonal support of the measure by the indi
vidual members of the association.
Search maintained that the National
Reciprocity Convention, . which- was;: held
in 'Washington last November, was thor
oughly representative of the manufactur
ing interests of the country and its action
indicative ! of ' the true sentiments' of the
manufacturers concerning reciprocity. He
declared. that further development of the

possibilities of special legislation like that

SEATTLE, April 15.â Dal Hawkins "went
down to defeat before Perry Queenan at
the Armory to-night after , one of the
prettiest fights ever pulled off In Seattle.
The end came with startling suddenness.
Uoth men were fighting fast and going
strong in the thirteenth round, when, just
at the close, Perry caught Dal a terrific
blow in the stomach. Â¦ The older fighter
bent nearly double and the bell saved
him from going out in that round.
Dal was plainly worried when he came
out -of his corner for the fourteenth, but
went to" certain ' defeat with gameness.
Perry carried the fight right to Dal from
the tap of the gong and ripped a terrific
right to Hawkins* body. Dal swayed and
saved himself from going to the floor only
by spreading his legs. Perry was after
him like a tiger. He sent a long sweep to
the jaw and followed with a lunge with
the right to the same spot. Dal went 'to
the -floor with a crash. His head struck
first and he lay stretched on his back. with
hi3 eyes, set and not a '. muscle . moving.
Dal drew up his right leg at the count of
nine and, his head rolled a little to one
side, but he could not get up. He j was
counted out.
It; was a clean fight and the best man
won. Queenan rushed matters from the*
start and played for the body from the
tap of the gong. Hawkins stalled him off
with his clever left for- live round3, but
in- the sixth Queenan landed -his- first
solid punch of the fight.- It .was a right
drive . over the heart. . It " made : 'Dal
wince, and his body : was still- red. from
:.he effects of It when he got the finish
ing stroke. Queenan- kept up his body
fighting through the contest, and Â¦ the
light swings he landed slowly wore Dal
down to defeat. '
Hawkins played a" walling same
throughout the" fight t The younger - and
stronger man had .-.to . carry- the . fight' to
the veteran, who contented". himself " with

NEW YORK, April 15.â Public an
nouncement will be made after the instal
lation ceremonies in Columbia College of
a munificent money gift to that institu
tion by Andrew Carnegie, according to
information which reaches the Press and
which that paper will print to-morrow.
The. exact amount is known only to the
president and the board of trustees, but
there is good reason to believe that.it is
not far short of $1,000,000. This will be
more than sufficient to build a college
hall, a chapel or dormitories, to which
purpose the gift is to be applied. <~
Carnegie up to this time hag given noth
ing to Columbia. Carnegie and John D.
Rockefeller will be guests of the univer
sity on Saturday, and the presence of the
great ironmaster is regarded as an Indi
cation that Columbia is about to be re
membered.
Socialist disturbances occurred last
night at Xamur. A mob stoned the po
fte.' who charged with drawn swords.
STibs^quently a force of gendarmes scat
. tered the rioters.
. The strike is steadily extending, both in
this city and its suburbs, especially at
Molenbeek, where a number of large fac
tories have stopped work.
The burgomaster has refused the social
ists' request to be allowed to follow their
own devices in burying the socialists
killed during Saturday's riots. Orders
have been issued for the procession to be
held at 6 o'clock in the morning, without
bands or funeral emblems. Otherwise
the interment must be carried out at
night. . .
It is estimated that the strikers in the
Charleroi district now number 50,000.
There are frequent parades there, but the
town Is generally peaceful. In accord
ance with the advice of the strike lead
' ers.
All the factories and mines at Morlan
welz. Valare and Mabille have been
closed.
In consequence of the disorders the pu
pils of several common schools have been
dismissed and the premises utilized as
barracks for troops.
Schools Used as Barracks.
The strike in Brussels and its" environs
is of a minor character, but in the indus
trial districts it is to-day more formid
able than ever.
The appeal of the socialist leaders for
& demonstration at the Chamber of Dep
uties to-morrow has created some unea
siness. A number of shopkeepers have
barricaded their windows. It â¢ rumored
to-night that the cab drivers and tram
way men will strike.
The socialists are pleased with the Lib
eral manifesto presented in the Chamber
this afternoon, as it supports their de
mands.
In the Chamber of Deputies this after
noon II. Neujean presented a manifesto
on behalf of the Liberal members of the
Leftists, demanding dissolution in order
to enable the country to pronounce on the
revision question. This manifesto pointed
out that the time was critical and the
country threatened with civil war, and
for the Government to consent to a loyal
and constitutional settlement could not be
represented as a surrender to popular dis
order. â¢*" *'.
To this challenge the Premier. 11. de
Smet de Nayer, replied briefly by declar
ing that the right of dissolution rested
with the King. He added that he felt It
his duty to warn Parliament against the
rumors of Government concessions.
M. Janson, the Liberal leader, retorted
that the Chamber could, by a motion,
cali upon the King to change the Minis
try. He said there was no sign of con
ciliation in the Premier's reply to M. Neu
jean and that responsibility for the con
sequences would rest on the Government.
Refuse to Resign. y
At this point M. Woest, a Catholic Dep
uty, who. although not a Minister, is a
powerful adherent of the Government,
jumped up and exclaimed: "There is no
civil war, but only evilly disposed men.
You demand our resignation, but you
shall not have it."
The President then declared the incident
closed and the House rose.
To-morrow the Socialist members of the
Chamber will present their demand for
universal suffrage. This will inevitably
be defeated, and it is feared that this de
feat will lead to trouble, particularly in
the provinces..
Xo noteworthy incident occurred to-day
in the streets of the city. The authorities
have taken extraordinary measures to
avert disorders, and the whole quarter,
comprising the Chamber of Deputies, the
palace and the Ministers, is kept in com
plete fsolation from the rest of the city
by cordons of the city gruard.
A torrential storm, which began at 8
o'clock this evening, has cleared the

BRUSSELS, April 15.â The Government
has firmly declined to yield' on the ques
tion of revision, and unless King Leopold
should override the Ministry there seems
to be nothing to prevent the development

It was the tax on bread that'in the old days i led
to the Iriumphof the Cobdenites and the adoption
of free trade. A return to the corn laws therefore
would be a complete swing of the pendulum back
to its old position. The. duties , on grain could not.
long stand alone; for protection must be comprehen
sive in order to be popular, and it is quite, likely,
therefore, that Great ; Britain is at the beginning pf
a resumption of a. thorough protective system. j
The proposed imposition. of duties on grain is. not
unexpected.. In fact/long before the war. in South
Africa there was a- growing demand for protection
to the farming industry.' The war, with its
attendant debt and heavy expenditure, has precipi
tated an issue that would hav^come. sooner : or:
later even had the empire remained at peace. In fact,
of late, years the farmer has had ; more-or ; jess, sym
pathy from the manufacturer, for theVmafkets-of'.th^e!
kingdom are no'longer secure for. manufactured
Â£>,IR MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH has made the
plunge. After all the years of free trade he
*<~s purposes to restore the corn laws.' It is true
he evades as far as he can the issue which his
budget raises by speaking of the duties he proposes
to put upon grain as "registration duties" and declar
ing they will not be in any way "protective duties,"
but the evasion will avail only with those who wish
to be fooled, f The. mass of the British people under
stand the situation. That much -was sjiown by the
fact that the tax ort grain had hardly been an
nounced in the Commons - before extra editions of
the papers were on the street arid the newsboys
were shouting, "Tax on bread.";

The prospects of an early close of the war in South

ANSWEBS TO COBBESPONDEUTS.
Editor The Callâ I note in your issue
of yesterday the account of the destruc
tion by tire on April 3, 150 miles west of
San Francisco, of the coal-laden British
ship Frankistan and the fortunate rescue
of her crew by the schooner H. C. "Wright.
I have personal experience of what flre
at sea means, for I was a passenger on a
ship on fire having 700 pounds of gun
powder aboard. When the fire was dis
covered in time to extineuish the flames
by strenuous efforts it was burning fierce
ly within six inches of the wooden caso3
containing the powder. , .'
Sailors who have often, faced death
calmly and without â¢ fear in hurricanes
pale and tremble when the cry of flre is.
heard, and well they may, for they
know that in nine .cases out of ten they
are helpless and doomed.
Water poured into the hold of a coal
ship pn fire, in whatever, quantity, seldom
has any effect in' subduing' the flaWs. ; Â¦
â Allow,. me to. make*, suggestion in your
columns .^as < follows: Let- every- ship,
especially coal ships,- be compelled to
carry a few barrels of pulverized marble
(carbonate of lime) and several carboys
of sulphuric acid. Let a suitable vessel
cr tank (it is very simple and cheaply
made) be put in 'some : convenient place In
the "ship where it can be readily reached.
Mix the acid and marble in this vessel
and ' Instantly ' carbon dioxide (carbonic
acid gas) will be generated in volume.
This gas is very heavy and is discharged
into the hold of the' ship and will rapidly
subdue the fire, being a destroyer of com
bustion. .- ' Â¦ '
It seems strange to me that the sug
gestion has not occurred to ship-owners
and insurance companies where so much
of life and property is at stake.
LOUIS BLANDING.
: Sonora, April 9. . .
Suggestion to Ship-Owners.
We trust no one will miss a single excellence of
this two months' study of how to be caustic when
trying hard. In the first place due note should be
taken of the Governor's assurance of his recogni
tion of the convention as a "commendable assembly"
engaged in "momentous deliberations," and the
reader should make up his mind before going further
whether those phrases were designed for compli
ments or for satire. Next due attention should be
given to the remark that the delegates to the com
mendable assembly should be "absolutely exempt
from all personal influence of candidates," and an
understanding reached as to the meaning of the
phrase and the reason for making it Finally, the
pith, point and pungency of the whole elaborate
sentence is reached in the. announcement that to re
lieve the commendable assembly, of embarrassing in
fluences aft "aspirants for gubernatorial honors"
ought to stay away from the convention. That's
caustic.
In this letter the Governor may be said to have
capped the climax of his verbiage. What he has
done hitherto in the way of slurring his fellow guests
at banquets and other gatherings of a genial nature
count as nothing to this. Evidently the Governor
is better as a writer than as a speaker. His style im
proves after months of revision and correction. If
he should take a year to the production of such a
note he might write one that, would be caustic
enough to hurt somebody.
There is no reason for any special asto'nishment
that the Governor should have taken so much trou
ble to be caustic at this particular juncture. There
are a good many aspirants for the Republican nomi
nation for Governor this year, and it was a foregone
conclusion that most of them would attend the con
vention. The opportunity to scatter caustic over the
whole bunch with one swing was therefore excellent.
Gage would not have missed for.anj'thing such a
chance to insult all his rivals at one swoop. It was
like getting, a whole flock of sheep at one raid. He
meditated on it for two months and then he did it
The result is a caustic gem. It . should be read
carefullj', and the relation to one another of the va
rious parts of the paragraph should be keenly noted.
It runs thus: "While realizing the importance of
the convention, and that its purpose is to promote
the best interests of the great Republican party,
whose principles we cherish, and believing that the
momentous deliberations of the convention should
be absolutely exempt from all personal influence of
candidates, and likewise believing that the labors of
your commendable assemblage cannot be free from
embarrassing influences if aspirants for gubernatorial
honors attend the convention (and you are well
aware that I desire and expect the people will accord
me the proud distinction of a renomination) ; there
fore, putting aside self-interest in the premises and
looking solely toward the welfare of the Republican
party, incident to untrammeled discussion, I deem
it my political duty to decline the very great honor
and pleasure of accepting your much esteemed invi
tation to be present at the convention."
His Excellency's i;ote shows his method at its
best It was not written without due deliberation
over its sentiments and careful elaboration of its
style. The invitation to which he replied was dated
February 6, and the reply was dated April 10. The
Governor, it will be seen, had taken more than two
months to meditate upon his satire and to fashion
to the highest finish the words and phrases by which
it "was to be expressed. i i
In the speech with which he opened his campaign
fcr the Governorship Gage announced to the public
that he intended to make use of "caustic verbiage."
He did not live up to the assertion during the
campaign, for after the first speech he became quite
mild. But no sooner had he obtained office than he
became quite caustic indeed. Since that time he has
never attended any gathering without being caustic
to somebody, and it is therefore natural that since
he could not attend the San Jose convention he
should send the caustic verbiage by letter.
GOVERNOR GAGE'S letter to the Hon.
Alden Anderson declining to attend the
convention of the State League of Republi
can Clubs, and taunting every aspirant for the Gov
ernorship A\ho did attend it, should not have been a
surprise to the public What else could have been
expected of his Excellency in the art of casting in
sults round the land? From start to finish his rec
crd on that score has been consistent and unique.
GAGE'S CAUSTIC VERBIAGE.
This is one of the occasions where money talks best
when it talks promptly. The funds needed for the
reception of the visitors and for preparing commo
dious quarters for the transaction of their work
ought to-be subscribed early, so that everything will
be in order when the first visitors arrive and a good
impression be made upon them. . .
San Francisco has now an opportunity to make
herself attractive to this rich /and growing conven
tion and tourist trade. It is worth bidding for as a
business' proposition even if. there were no question
of hospitality, involved in the matter. Our people
should be liberal in providing for the entertainment
of the coming guests, and .the- local representatives
of. the two orders should have cordial help from the
citizens generally. in making arrangements for their
coming.
' The profits accruing ' to any ; community : ' which
rightly entertains large numbers of visitors are im
mense. There are some communities that virtually
live on visitors alone, nor are they by any means un
enterprising communities,;- Theigvea^city..pJ Paris
finds "it worth while to expend millions of- 'francs
every year in beautifying her streets and parks and
brightening them at night by innumerable. lamps just
for the sake qf attracting visitors. In fact, the tour
ist trade of our time is enormous," and the richest
cities in the world cannot afford to ignore it nor to
pass it over without making some attempt to attract
it and to retain it. ; .. ,. , '.
. The record of national;. gatherings 'in the /city last
year, when taken in connection with the arrange
ments made for similar conventions during the com
ing summer, affords convincing proof that San Fran
cisco has now become recognized as one of the
foremost convention cities of the Union: The pres
tige we now enjoy' in that respect willincrease with
the years, for it is indisputable that no other city of
any considerable siae is anything like so pleasant for
summer gatherings. .Visitors who come to us swel
tering from; the East find here a climate so cool and
so bracing that they' return home to "boom" the
claims of San Francisco as a convention city against
all rivals. .Thus each new convention adds to the
number of 1 those who. favor holding future conven
tions here, and so as 'time passes San Francisco, will
find in such gatherings an increasing source of busi
ness activity and wealth.
.V.Tr . T.ITH the national, gatherings of. the Mystic
V/V/;'Shriners.and Â¦ the -^Knights^of /Pythias San
Â» Â¦-Â¥:'; Francisco is^ to have this i summer one of the
liveliest 'seasons m â¢Her'* career: 'Â¦ Each of tlie great or
ders has a nuraerbiis 'membership,.' and' 'each 1 - will
bring- to the -city- many thousands' of visitors from
all parts of the jJm^n^T^y^iiy^o^emofioafy for
business, but tor pleasure', and it behooves us to pro

Everybody-, in is now laughing
over Maxwell's book, x "The Countess of

of the sketches are really taken from
life. The book is creating almost as much
a sensation ( as did "The Visits of Eliza

observer of matters : in the social world

Murray Js to make the experiment of

That, indeed, is the reason for the de

of the circumstance that so many, novels

prices.

this experiment is to be tr?ed is by^ Mont

agreeably of Tuscany â¢ and the Tuscan
people. It is entitled "The Life pf Jo^i

imply, the book Is ff; character! study.

CHINA'S CONSUL
AT HONOLULU
IS IN TROUBLE
LOS ANGELES, , April 13.â E. Percival
Baker, who claimed to be a magazine
writer, is dead, and his wife, Natalie Ba
ker, is at death's door as a result of an
attempt at double suicide. It is supposed
that the couple took chloroform last
night. When discovered this morning
Baker was dead and his wife was still
alive, though her recovery is doubtful.
Baker won notoriety recently by secur
ing a photograph of the foot of a Chme3e
woman In Los Angeles,- Impersonating an
officer in order to/accomplish his object.
For representing himself as " a Govern
ment official he was arrested and prose
cution was begun in the Federal Court.
The case is still pending, due to Baker's
repeated motions for postponement be
cause of alleged illness. - .
No reason for the suicide is known. It
is known, however, that Baker was great
ly worried as to the result of his trial,
and it is thought that this may have been
one reason for. his determination to end
his life.
Sunday afternoon the pair appeared at
the St. Lawrence lodging-house and
asked to be shown a room. After lo.ok
ing at an apartment they j expressed
themselves satisfied and engaged j the
quarters. At first they declined to sign
the register, but, pressed to do so, fin
ally gave the name of Mr. and Mrs."
Stanley.
Last evening Baker and his wife were
heard to threaten to. take, their lives;
They sent out for prescriptions, or what
were thought to be prescriptions at the
time. It is now thought that the fatal
drugs were obtained at thl3 time. During
the night j-oomers heard more or less
noise in the apartment occupied by the
Bakers, but thought nothing of the mat
ter until this mornidg, when Investiga
tion disclosed the husband dead and the
wife apparently dying at his side.

GOSSIP FROM

OF LETTERS
Bishop Nichols of California, who is>
here straightening out the affairs of the
Anglican church now that it has become
an American church, has decided to make
St. Clement's Church a separate parish,
with the Rev. John Usborrie, who has
been rector of Honolulu, though of late
years not recognized by Bishop Willis, as
rector of St. Clement's.
, J. G. Pratt, appointed by the Honolulu
Chamber of Commerce and .the Mer
chants' Association to represent both as
sociations in Washington in efforts to se
cure a cable and get Federal assistance
in the.payment of claims for losses in the
Chinatown plague fire,'- leaves to-day on
the Alameda for Washington.
An election is in progress here to-day
to fill the vacancy in the Legislature
caused by the death of Representative A.
F. Gilflllan. Up to the hour of the de
parture of the Alameda there was little
excitement, though Home Rule and Re
publican workers worked hard, and a
small vote. was being polled.
,. The transport Sheridan arrived here
this morning from San Francisco with a
case of smallpox on board. The case de
veloped when the vessel was two days
out from San Francisco. The patient is a
recruit, who was removed to the quaran
tine station here. The transport is kept
in quarantine in the harbor.
It Is charged against the Consul that he
proceeded to send the names of leaders
in the society here to the imperial au
thorities in China, singling them out for
punishment through their relatives. In at
least one case a Honolulu i Chinaman's
mother is declared to have been impris
oned and tortured to death on account of
this action by the. Consul here. Yang is
also 'alleged to have used his position
here to . extort money from those of his
countrymen.' here who needed ' residence
certificates and other like. documents.
HONOLULU, April 9.-Secretary Cooper
is investigating - charges preferred at
Washington against Yang Wei Pin, the
Chinese Consul here. : The charges wens
sent forward last February by persons,
opposed to Yang, and It is stated that
Cooper was asked to make an investiga
tion and report at once.
One of the principal counts against the
Consul has to do with his actions at the
time of the organization here of the Bow
Wong, or reform society of Chinese. At
that time Yang. Wei Pin _ took a. strong
stand for the Empress Dowager and vig
orously fought against the new organiza
tion. He succeeded in preventing the
Bow Wongs from getting a charter to in
corporate under the laws of Hawaii, rep
resenting to Governor Dole's Cabinet that
the society was revolutionary and prac
ticed highbinder methods. The organiza
tion without a charter, however, under
the leadership of Leung Chi-tso, one of
the Emperor's former reform adviser3,
was accomplished and most of the Chi
nese here enrolled. â¢ : ; '

Honan, in the north. The rebels charged

murdered ( and . an Italian- priest was

The rebels have robbed in a wholesale

killing the mandarins in the several, towns
which : endeavored to resist them. â¢
The first discharge of the Government
batteries caused a heavy loss of life, but

CANNON FAIL
TO STAY REBELS
IN SOUTH CHINA
Colonists who go to take homesteads and men
who have only brains and muscle will save them
selves much, trouble by clipping Mr. Â¦ Carpenter's
conclusions and keeping them for future reference.
Let it be remembered, too, that the Southern life of
luxury before the war can be renewed only by re
newing the conditions which produced, ifâ a depen
dent and servile labor system. , .
"Indeed, it seems to me that our new possessions
offer a most attractive field for such men. The
Philippines are an empire of undeveloped resources,
which as soon as matters become quiet will go for
ward on the seven-league boots of modern
progress. In the future every island will be spotted
with the homes of rich and well-to-do Americans,
and I venture that the society there will be equal
to that of any part, of the United States. The Ameri
can population will be rich, it will have good schools
at home and will also educate its children abroad.
It will, in short, be somewhat like the best society
of the South in the days before the war."
"There is plenty of room for syndicate invest
ments. Corporations and individuals with large cap
ital can easily place money where it will pay a big
interest on long-time investments. Young men who
have some money and business brains can find
plenty of chances to make fortunes, but' they must
go out and look over the ground for themselves and
expect to make the Philippines their home for eight
or ten years at least. .
"The same is so with retail merchants. .- The;trade
is almost altogether in the hands of Chinese, who
can live more cheaply and sell closer than we can.
There are limited openings for American lawyers,
doctors and dentists, and, in fact, for almost any of
our professional men who will go to the islands ex
pecting to stay there and grow up with the country.
One of the most copious promoters of our Phil
ippine policy is Mr. Frank G. Carpenter, who has
supplied the American press with more matter on
the subject than any other writer. His last article
on that subject fills several, columns with a brightly
colored picture of the islands, raising anew the
glamour of the tropics that has been upon the minds
of men whenever they look toward the equator.
But he concludes the picture with this: "There is
one thing, however, that should be remembered by
all who think of going to the Philippines. The
country is no, place. for those who have oniy brains
and muscle to offer. The Filipinos make .excellent
bookkeepers and clerks, and they, will work for half
the wages of an American.- Ordinary labor is poorly
paid, and between v the? Chinese and Filipinos there
are few chances for Americans who work only, with
their hands. -Â¦ :
The natives are expert mechanics. ? They* supply
all the manual trades, and as they work cheaply ?no
room is left there for our handicraftsmen, except to
a limited extent, perhaps; as foremen and superin
tendents. The decision of the War Department to
limit military service there to two years is ,, founded
on the experience of Spain, which found that twenty
four months brought her, troops up to the climatic
deadline and they had to cross it or be rescued and
sent home. We take better care of our soldiers
and preserve them from the acute diseases to which
the climate subjected the Spaniards. But no care
can guard against the nerve-slacking effect of the
climate. Under it men suffer first lassitude, loss of
energy and then collapse.
It is to be hoped that these plans will; be f/aba'n*
doned. That class of our fellow^ citizens are of Very
moderate means. The climate 'is unfriendly : .V. and
their dreams may end in serious disaster, 'or "at "the
best in serious disappointment. The- islands hayeV, a
more dense population than any of our States.;/' The
church lands which we are to buy. and .then ' give
away are already occupied by the natives,;. who have
lived on them for generations as the tenants of the
church. Not an acre can be occupied by an Ameri
can without eviction of-the native -tenant .and "his
family. No matter about the strict legal rights of
the case, the natives will not be reconciled to evic
tion, and the process will simply deepen in Â»the'm'-;'the'
hatred they now feel for us as their master. .' With
the climate as their ally, by even' suchV passive: re
sistance as all. Orientals practice, they>cajn' make '.the
country intolerable to' the strangers who; drive them
from the soil. .".',- â¢' ! J - V
The very earnest supporters of our permanent
ownership of the islands, are performing a very im
portant duty by disclosing the situation there for the
enlightenment of our people, who have heretofore
proceeded on assumed facts which do not exist. The
Government is considering the purchase of land be
longing to the friars for a sum variously estimated
at from seven to seventeen millions, to be appro
priated by Congress. It is proposed that the land
so acquired shall be thrown open to free homestead
entry. This proposition lias stimulated the activity
cf agents and promoters in the direction' of; colony
organization, to transfer Americans of -''the home

At a meeting of the Police Commis

gists appeared to inquire what action the
board Intended to take in the matter of
the sale of liquor on their premises. The
Inquiry was brought by the proprietors
of Lengfeld's Pharmacy, who applied for
a saloon license. " The Commissioners
etated that they were opposed to the
proposition of granting saloon licenses to
druggists, but at the same time they
proposed to see that the lawT^gnlating:
the sale of liquors in small quantities
phould bo observed. By mutual consent
representatives of the Druggists' Asso
ciation and the Commissioners will meet
next Monday afternoon and discuss the
matter. . J
The citation against the Baldwin An

__ â y
Greatly to the surprise and satisfaction
of the officials at the Mail dock, the
guests of the Hotel Oriental, commonly
called the detention shed, at the Mall
dock, behaved admirably yesterday. The
Chinese who are being confined. there un
til the Collector of Customs and the Chi
nese Bureau investigate their right to
either land in this country or to pass
through on their way to Mexico, got wind
of the. fact that the Toyo Klsen Kaisha's
Hongkong Maru was to sail for the
Orient. They were ready to make a va
liant stand rather than be sent back to
the land of the dragon, 'but two things
dissuaded them from making any out
break. , . .
Captain Anderson, whd Is In charge or
the Mall dock, prepared for emergencies.
He had half a dozen hoses fastened to as
many hydrants and at a given signal a'
hydraulic brigade, composed of employes
and customs inspectors, were to train
streams of water on the belligerent Mon
golians. Then friends notified the im
prisoned Chinamen that R. P. Schwerin
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
who is in Washington, telegraphed out
that the Supreme Court of the United
States would shortly hand down a decision
in the matter of the appeals from Cus
toms Collector Stratton's denial of their
petition to pass through this country in
transit to Mexico.
Rather than receive a ducking for their
pains, the Chinese decided to postpone
hostilities until the 23d inst., when an
other steamer sails for China. Captain
Anderson proposes being on his guard and
will have his hydraulic brigade in readi
ness to repel attacks. He thinks he has
solved the problem of preventing out
breaks similar to that which occurred a
month ago and tells the detained
Chinamen that they must not shy rice
bowls and other articles of tableware at
officers who are directed to deport them.
As there are ninety-six in the hotel, there
will be a warm time there if the Supreme
Court decides they are unlawfully in this
! country.
Collector Stratton received a dispatch
yesterday from Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Taylor, instructing him to serve
a notice on the steamship company re
quiring that corporation to deport the
ninety-eigrht "in transit" Chinese imme

ply notified the Collector that tho deten

had been tampered with and could have
been opened at any hour, regardless of
the time attachment that was a part of
it. That Dimmick could have learned the
combination while Cashier Cole was ad
justing it was also testified to, and that
he did know it was intimated in the tes
timony.
Several witnesses were placed on the
stand to relate stories of Dlmmick's mid
night jvisits to the Mint. Two watchmen
said that the accused, some time about
the middle of March, 1901, was ,seen to
pass from his office shortly before 12
o'clock at night and take a Mission street
car in the direction of the ferry. Dim
mick carried a dress suit case, which, ac
cording to the testimony of one of the
clerks, he had brought to the Mint early
In the morning. On another occasion, and
about two months later than the I event
just related, Dimmick was seen to pass
from his office into the receiving-room of
the Mint, where he remained probably
five minutes. The receiving-room opens
into the cashier's room,* from which the
$30,000 in gold is alleged to have been
stolen. The witness to this last transac
tion says it occurred just previous to the
midnight hour.
Incriminating Statements.
There was other testimony as to incrim
inating statements made by the defend
ant previous to and after the theft had i
been discovered. The witnesses who gave
testimony on this subject were submitted
to rigid cross-examinations by Attorney
Collins for the defense, but remained -firm
as to their statements.
Charles Waltz, a lock expert, of 109
Market street took the stand for cross
examination when court convened. He
showed to the jury how the "dog" of the
time lock on the cashier's vault had been
fileu down, rendering it useless. He also
explained the workings of time locks, and ,
said that such appliances with defective
"dogs" could be opened at any time with
out regard to the hour at which they had
been set. Attorney Collins for the defense
attempted to show that the lock was inv
perfect order before Waltz had put on the |
proper "dog." but he failed. j
Waltz described the lock as being gen- ,
erally tampered with. He said that the j
bolts, wires and screws were all loose, j
Collins wanted to know if, had certain |
defects not existed, the lock would have
been all right. Witness replied that he
judged the lock by all defects as he found
them. Finally Judge de Haven put a stop
to further waste of time on the subject.
Witness then explained the setting of
the combinations and the manner of
changing them. He told of the ability of
a person standing at the back of the
door to ascertain the combination while
another person standing in front turned
the spindle to the correct numbers. Col
lins stood in front of the "dummy" door,
turning the knob, while Waltz called off
the numbers from the back. Collins
turned fast, obliging the witness to call a
halt oÂ»' speed several times. Judge de
Haven finally insisted that Collins treat
the witness fairly. This testimony was
introduÂ«ed for the purpose of showing
that Dimmick, when he stood at the back
of the vault door with Cole in front, could
have easily learned what the combination
wae.
Waltz resumed the stanA after the noon
recess, and the prosecutiln explained to
the court that during thfi recess Collins
and Dimmick had worked on the lock.
This was introduced to show that Dim
mick understood its workings perfectly.
John P. Bergin, vault expert for the
United States Treasury Department, was
the next witness. He has been acquaint-
ed with the profession of testing locks
since 1S79, and came to San Francisco in
July, 1901, at the request of the Govern
ment.
Conversations With Dimmick.
Bergin said that It was possible for a
tnan to ascertain a combination by vlew
ng its mechanism from the rear. He
thought that a person endowed with an
iverage amount of intelligence could
name at least six or eight combinations
lo the hour. Bergin then told of the dis
covery of the mutilated "dog" and bolt
and of experiments made, which proved
that the time attachment had been ren
aered practically worthless.
Benjamin W. Day, who succeeded Dim
mick as chief clerk, told of conversations
he had had with the defendant at various
times. "On June 28," said the witness,
"I was standing with Dimmick while Mr.
Leach was trying to open the vault. I
observed that Dimmick took a memoran
dum from his pocket and consulted it. I
asked him if he did not know the com
bination and he replied that he did not.
When Dimmick informed me of the dis
covery of the theft ne remarked: 'This Is
one of the most mysterious affairs that
ever happened. Thirty thousand dollars
has been stolen between the door of this
the cashier's vault and the vault down
stairs.' "XI ~
"During March or April," continued the
witness, "Dimmick remarked to me that
lie expected some day to find the cash
ier's vault in such a condition that it
would create a sensation. This remark
?ave me no surprise at the time, but I
consider it singular, owing to the fact
that there was not the slightest suspicion
Df possible loss at that time."
W. P. Hundley, assistant weighing
clerk, testified that on June 28 he askea
Dimmick to open the vault and that the
latter replied -that he would- not touch it
for $250,000. Cashier Cole was ill at the
time and Hundley and other employes
were waiting to receive their month's sal
ary. W. P. Cole was .recalled by the
prosecution for the purpose of testifying
as to the adjusting of the combination in
September, 1900. Collins brought under
discussion another lock, on the vault.
The prosecution objected to -this as the
upper lock in the vault had been the only
one in use. The defense contended that
the testimony was material, but Judge de
Haven sustained the objection, saying:
"1 think such testimony Is irrelevant
and will rule it out."
"We think It is relevant," said Collins,
"and we take an exception to the remark
of the court."
That Dress Suit Case.
Thomas N. Brickford, night watchman
at the Mint, testified that about the mid
dle of March. 1901, he saw Dimmick leav
ing the building, shortly before, the mid
night hour, a dress suit case in one hand
and an overcoat over his arm. Brickford
remarked that Dimmick had been work
ing rather late and Dimmick replied
something about having to check up his
accounts. The conversation was of but a
moment's duration, after which Dimmick
walked to the corner of Mission and Fifth
streets and took a car in the direction of
the ferry. Collins cross-examined Brick
ford on the possibility of the dress suit
case being a bundle of ledgers.
E. R. Sims, a clerk in Dimnfick's office,
said that one morning:, about the middle
of March, he observed Dimmick bring a
dress suit case into the office and set it
down op 'he floor. Sims was followed by
Thomas E. Healy. an inside watchman,
who, abcit the same time, saw Dimmick
pass frori: his office as the midnight hour
approached, with the dress suit case in
his hand, and go into the street.
Healy said that about two months later
and at the same hour of the night, Dim
mick opened the door of the chief
clerk's office and paused on the . thres
hold. There were three other watchmen
present and Dimmick addressed them,
saying: "It is not often I get a chance
to see you boys at this hour of the night."
Dimmick .then crossed the hall to the door
of the receiver's room and remained In
the latter room about five minutes.
"There is a door." explained the wit
ness, "leading from the receiver's room
Into the cashier's room.". "â¢-

court was adjourned until this mornine.

The Grand Jury has decided to institute
a rigorous Â¦ crusade against perjurers in
criminal cases. The whole session yes
terday afternoon was devoted to the in
vestigation of the testimony, given at the
Galvin trial. The Clark woman was sum
moned and she told the jury about the
commission of the brutal crime. Like
Galvin she also has been spending her
time ' in jail waiting for the court to
pass sentence upon her. In connection
with the case the Grand Jury also exam,
ined District Attorney Byington and his
assistant. Porter Ashe, Mrs. Foote and
the hackman who drove Anita Clark, Gal
vin and their victim to the Elysium-
Fred" Hansted, better known as "Youns
Dutchy," who was arrested on suspicion
of having been connected with the assault
on Thomas Garrett, was in attendance In
the ante-chamber of th"e Grand Jury
awaiting the pleasure of that body.
Thomas Galvin, who with Anita Clark
beat and robbed Mrs. Ellen J. Foote last
December, and who is now confined In
Jail awaiting sentence for grand larceny,
is to be indicted on the more serious
charge of perjury. Such was the decision
reached yesterday by the Grand Jury. It
will be charged in the indictment that
Galvin gave false testimony while at
tempting to prove an alibi on the robtfery
charge. An indictment will also be
brought against Joseph. T. Finn, who as
sisted Galvin in his efforts to prove that
he was not in the vicinity of the Elysium
when Mrs. Foote was maltreated and
robbed.

Last night's programme contained ex
amples of many schools. Bach came
first with the C minor Prelude and Fugue,
played with a limpid clarity and baiance
that left nothing to be desired. The som
ber and stormy sonate Op. Ill (Maestoso,
Allegro con brio, and /Arietta con Varl
azioni) of Beethoven followed, its troubled
magnificence given with . symphonic
breadth and subtlest appreciation. Two
Schubert numbers came next, one of them
the famous old warhorse. "Marche Mili
taire," that Mrs. Zeisler plays as no one
else can. Chopin was well represented
by four numbers magnificently handled;
and a sensational feature of the pro
gramme was the Leschetizky arrange
ment of the "Lucia Sestetto," for left
hand alone, a dazzlingly difficult affair,
given with laughable ease. Two Mos
kowskl numbers and a Strauss-Tausig
valse of orchestral scope ended the pro
gramme in a victorious fashion.
Mrs. Zeisler will be heard again this
atfernoon at Metropolitan Temple, and
the following programme is announced:
Mrs. Zeisler's gifts are all of the ex
traordinary order. She has a tremendous
temperament, a colossal technique and a
musical Intelligence that has successfully
grappled with every problem that is pre
sented to the pianist. Certainly Mrs. Zeis
ler is an artist to be beard, one that no
pianist, musician or lover of the art
should miss bearing.
Last night at Metropolitan Temple, to
a house absurdly small but lavishly en
thusiastic, the first recital of Fannie
Bloomfleld Zeisler was given. Mrs. Zeis
ler's work is well known here and flatter
ingly remembered, but it is an even
greater artist that returns to us this time
than was heard here some five or six
years ago. It would exhaust the superla
tives to attempt to set down her number
less perfections, her superb polyphonic
grasp, loveliness of touch and tone color
and marvelous dynamic control from the
most heroic fortissimo to the merest,
finest elfin. thread of a sound possible to
conceive.

new boiler for the siren, and will set to
work at once to get a requisition for this
purpose. He says many complaints have
been registered at headquarters by pass
ing vessels that the siren is weak, and
vessels sometimes , do not hear it until
close upon it. . Mr. : Valintlne says that
this is owing somewhat to the bad acous
tic properties of the surroundings.

Valley Development Association, next
Saturday, every county, in the valley will
be urged by President W. S. Green to send

- FVW.;Hartzell of the. Vallejo' Chamber
*of Commerce called at the State Board of
Trade yesterday and inquired what Val
lejo could do to get before the public. Lee

Norte County was . preparing to have a

The efforts of the interior counties of
California to help themselves are showing
results even at this early day. Eastern
people who now visit the exhibition- hall
of the State Board of Trade get an idea
directly that there are at least two great
valleys on the map of California, that of
the Sacramento and San . Joaquin. For
the first time in the history of the Board
of Prade the valleys mentioned have rep
resentatives in the . premises ! who are en
gaged in exploiting the resources of their
separate sections. Calvin Brown, secre
tary, of the Stockton - Chamber of Com
merce, tells all visitors about Stockton in
particular and P. E. Wright, secretary of
the Sacramento Valley Development As
sociation, sets forth the advantages, phy
sical, mental and spiritual of residence in
the Sacramento Valley's superb expanse.
No visitor from the East thus has a
chance, to hear a one-sided tale. , If. he
learns about San Joaquin : County, he in
the next five minutes has an elementary
but comprehensive course of instruction
concerning the many fruitful counties
that He geographically farther north.
Parties who were on the way to Los An
geles have been persuaded to make visits
to both the San Joaquin and Sacramento
valleys, the strong: argument being used
with them that they could not visit these
sections at anything like so small an ex
pense for railroad fare's from Los Ange
les as from San Francisco. Two score of
homeseekers have been sent to look at the
Interior within the last few days. They
,are but the advance guard. Both great
valleys will havo better exhibits at the
State Board of Trade to fasten the atten
tion and stimulate the imagination of the
homeseekers within a short time.,.;

"This direction to the Board of Public

A dispatch of greeting was sent to L.
B. Lockhard, supreme protector at To
ledo, Ohio., in these words: " -
The Grand Lodge of the Golden State In an
nual session assembled sends fraternal greet
ings to the supreme protector of the queen of
benevolent orders.
During the afternoon session the Grand
Lodge degree was conferred on past pro
tectors who did not appear, at the morn
ing session. J. A. Colquhoun was appoint
ed jourffal clerk.
After hearing a statement from Mrs. S.
Beverson in relation to an effort made to
assist a helpless old lady into an old peo
ple's home the members of the Grand
Lodge made up a purse to help her along.
The party is not a member of the order.
Per Capita Tax Reduced.
THE fifteenth annual session of the
Grand Lodge of the Knights and
Ladles of Honor was opened iii
Pythian Castle yesterday morn
ing: by , Grand Protector Z, -T.
Whitten. There were present all the
grand i officers and the delegates to the
grand body, the list of which was printed
in The Call last Sunday. . '
For the first time in the history of the
order in this State any member of a sub
ordinate, lodge in good standing was per
mitted to enter . the ; Grand Lodge room
and watch the proceedings, but without
voice or vote. ' , .-â¢
The reports of the grand officers were
presented and referred' to the proper com
mittees.
The grand protector in his report says
that in the last year the croaKers and
calamity howlers of the order have been
reduced in a large degree and that the
order, in spite of che troublous times and
difficulty of a certain class of the mem
bership to struggle along, has not lost
any, but on the contrary has made a gain
in beneficial members, not large, it is
true, but still a perceptible net gain,
while other orders have sustained a net
lass. The finances, he declares, are satis
factory, showing that there is a larger
balance at this time than has been shown
in many years except one. He calls at
tention to the fact that this year, the
jubilee year of the order, should be ob
served In a fitting manner by the mem
bers in this State.
Grand Secretary Recommends.
The grand secretary in his report say.-j
that Mrs'. Emma Quitzow was appointed
to the position of deputy supreme pro
tector to advance the order in this juris
diction, and that while she had done good
work during the period she had filled that
oIBce she had not the opportunity to do
more by reason of the fact that there was
no provision for the payment of the trav
eling expenses, something that Is an ab
solute necessity. He states that the num
ber of deaths was thirteen, which includ
ed three members of the Grand Lodge-
Mrs. M. E. Uuncan, Emma Pease, who
was the grand sentinel, and Bertha Op
penhelmer, who was appointed to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Mrs.
Pease. The amount paid to beneficiaries
was ?22,500.
The following are the recommendations
of the grand secretary:
LÂ«t your motto be for the next term, to do
your part for the Increase of the members of
this order. Bring in at least one new member.
â¢In the selection of your gTancl officers put
sentimentality to one side and only consider
the good of the order. Direct a contingent
fund to be so used that a deputy's traveling
expenses can be paid out of same and an ac
count of the money so expended to be made
to ' this Grand Lodge. It has been correctly
stated that this order should better advertise
iteelf, and to that end I would recommend
that every member of this Grand Lodge and
every member of this jurisdiction be appointed
a committee of one to unite in one determined
committee to make a grand demonstration on
the occasion of the silver Jubilee of this noble
order, the twenty- fifth anniversary of its birth,
September C, 1902. I aÂ«>k this Grand Lodge
to take proper steps to fittingly observe this,
our natal day. , â¢ â¢
The degree of the Grand Lodge was
conferred on several past protectors.

The last statement of the Assessor waa

Sometimes the wife of a doctor can
bring her husband around when he dort't
know exactly how to help himself. The
wife of a certain well known phyeician In
Washington, D. C, concluded "that coffee
was the cause of the doctor's sleepless
nights. She says: "He would retire and
lie for hours, unable to sleep a wink. I
thought perhaps he was nervous from the
coffee which he drank at his meals and
suggested that he try Postum. To my
eurprise he objected most decidedly. I
Eaid nothing, but the next morning made
Postum Coffee instead of the regular cof-
fee and gave that to the doctor. I made
it according to directions and it had . a
beautiful coffee color and flavor. He
drank his cup and remarked that the cof-
fee was unusually good that morning and
askfd for more.

COAL AND IRON.
The production of coal and Iron measures
the growth of modern civilization everywhere
It is easy to predict the future of a country
rich in the two minerals, which stand for
energy and strength. The great Northwest hES
leaped Into prominence as the home ot the
precious metals, so-called. The crowds have
passed unnoticed the timbered areas the vast
coal measures and iron deposits of Washington
and British Columbia lor the clitteiing but
elusive Diizes locked in the ice and enow ot
laraway Nome and the Klondike
AIMS OF THE COMPANY.
The wants of this xrowins country are the
opportunity of the Tacoma Company. Its plans
look u> nothing less than meeting- the Western
demand lor iron and steel.
The total consumption of Iron on the Pacific
Coast already amounts to over 3000 tons daily
Let us ask what the demand will be live years
hence, with the population more than doubled
and the commerce of the Pacific ours. At the
present time the freight charges on iron from
the East, the source of all of our supplies, is
$10 to flS per ton. This single item means a
clear, additional sain on every ton that the
i-omp&ny will manufacture
COAL AND COKE. IRON AND STEEL.
The work planned for the Tacoma Company
may be stated in a line: It will bring to-
gether, at a point oa Puget Sound already
selected, the coal and iron found abundantly
on its properties. It will mine coal; but
marketing coal it not the end of the com-
pany's business. Its abundant coal supplies
will be turned into coke; but neither is the
manufacture and sale of coke the end sought. ,
The coke is one step, and only one. in the ;
process of manufacturing finished iron pro-
ducts. On the one hand we control half a
dozen great coal fields, carrying limitless quan-
tities or the best coking coal and located with-
in thirty-five miles of tidewater. And we are
Is close touch with the rfllroad companies,
which insures the lowest transportation rates.
Our iron mines are so fortunately situated that
their products v.lll be carried In chutes to the
barges which convey it to the company s works.
Railroads can never bleed us with excessive
charpes. Our ores and the reduction works '
are both located en tidewater and we shall
own the shirs which convey the ore to the
jjlace of treatment Our coal properties again
are so near the company's works that a short
and inexpensive electric line will furnish our |
own transportation from mine to tidewater
should the necessity for it arise.
FINISHED PRODUCTS THE AIM. !
We have already ore in practically limitless ]
quantities. The ore, besides being of the high- I
est grade, is self-contained, so far as the !
operations of the furnaces are concerned. It
contains only traces of sulphur and Is free
from titanium. By the addition of a small
quantity of hematic, found abundantly upon
the holdings of the company, this ore is self-
fluxing, and the quality of the iron thus pro-
duced is pronounced by expert authorities equal
to the best Swedish. We shall doubtless sell
liig iron, but this, no more than the sale of
coal and coke, is the goal of the great en-
terprise we are inaugurating. The pig Iron '
will co to the markets of the world In the
shape of rails and bars and trusses and all
the multifarious forms in which iron is de-
manded in modern life.
BUSINESS REALITIES.
The idea is planted In business realities.
More than ten years ago the far-sigrhted mÂ«-n
now at the head of the Tacoma. Cotnwiny bc-
fc-an putting tosether the great coal and iron
area* which are now the property of the coia-
1-ia.ny. It already has secured coal and iron
tuincient for its needs for years to come. It
has at its command Ereat capital and more
trnportanfThan' all its management, represents
the highest business talent and private wealth.
Seec thus the Tacoma is something more than
a company. It Is. In fact, a movement anal-
agcuE to the treat United States Steel Cor-
poration or the Standard Oil Company.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.
The development of this great enterprise
means the building of a great Industrial com-
munity. The company realizes all this and its
far-reaching plans extend to matters incidental
to the eeneral BCheme outlined above. The
growth of this community means greatly en-
hanced land values at the seat of the com-
pany's operations and corresponding profit
We are not prepared now to so at length into
this bra.ncli of our subject. It is sufficient
here to say that the company will- absolutely
control the site of this community of its own
creation. The Inevitable rise in values, the
unearned increment, will inure to the stock-
holders of the company. The profits of the
factories, stores, shops and bank so necessary
to community life will all go to swell the
â¢dividends of the parent company.
MANAGEMENT.
In the prospectus will be found condensed
sketches of the lives and business relations
of the officers of the Tacoma. Company. In an
especial decree the success of a mining enter- 1
prise depends on the character, integrity and
business ability of the men in charge. The
position and standing of these gentlemen in
business life are a sufficient guarantee of hon-
Â«st and efficient administration. Some eight
irreat dividend-paying enterprises, including
mines, banks, collieries and lumber companies.
eland to the credit of these gentlemen. The
Tacoma Company will be their ninth.
SUCCESSFUL MEN.
These men have all been successful. They
have the fullest knowledge and experience uf
mining and the broader walks of business life
Their reliability has been attested In a thou-
sand relations. Their talents and energies
have been placed unreservedly at the disposal
ot the cempany. -
Take the advice of one whose great fortune
came to him largely through Investments: "-I
never invest except with successful men. Show
me Â»n Investment in which successful men
are interested and pushing- and I go it blind."
SOURCES OF PROFIT.
This company had at its inception and be-
fore a single share of stock had been placed
en the market a great aggregation of very
valuable properties. These in many catÂ»?s are
now productive. Properties like the Marble
Bay holdings insure dividends at once. This
mine is a cividend-payer now and has been
ever since it was first opened. Our great coal
end iron interests also only await the installa-
tion of machinery, as fully planned, to make
large profits and corresponding dividends cer-
tain. These dividend-makers may be concisely
pointed out as follows:
1. â The immense deposit or high-grade Iron
et Redor.da and Texada mines.
2. â Ccal and coke from the Snell mines.
3. â Coal and Â«oke from the various Hay-
ward properties â 4000 acres.
4. â The lumber obtained from some 7000
acres of fir, spruce and cedar.

7. â A emelter to be located at Marble Bay

NEW YORK, April 15. â The dimensions of
the trading in Southern Railway stocks to
day eclipsed any ever before seen on the New
York Stock Exchange, i The' total j number of
shares of common stock outstanding Is-1,200,
000. The dealings recorded in the stock to
day were to the number of 864,500 shares.
On April 24, 1901. Union ' Pacific was ". dealt in
to the extent of 602, 800 shares, during the
struggle between the Morgan and Harriman
interests in the transcontinental field. . That
figure -was far in excess of any previous day's
dealings In a 1 single stock until to-day, r The
tremendous volume of these dealings 'dwarfed
the rest of the market and yet there were a
number of other stocks in which the dealings
were on a scale only seen during periods of
great speculative, activity. The opening in
Southern Railway was quiet enough and the
opening bulse in Louisville and Nashville . to
nearly 4 points over last' night awakened some
momentary skepticism of the over-night set- ;
tlement of the dispute for control of Louisville
and Nashville. But the parties in Interest
were already in consultation when tha stock
market opened and there was a scurrying, of
brokers from the neighborhood of the consul
tation rooms. Immediately buying orders ap
peared in Southern Railway lor seemingly un
limited amounts of the stock. The movement,
in the stock did net become wild at any time
in spite of the extreme advance of CVi points
to 40%. The reactionary tendency ot Louis
ville and Nashville was also a convincing
demonstration that the struggle for that stock
had terminated and the scramble to get out
by the smaller operators who had followed the
deal carried It down in successive stages to
125%. The last price, however, left It with
a net loss of only a point. Southern Railway
suffered at the last irom the profit-taking on
the part of ' the professional element, which
bought the stock recklessly, but was ap
parently not disposed to remain in it over
night, in face of the many possible contingen
cies still open in the situation. The reaction
carried Southern Railway back to 37% and It
closed only 1% higher. Â¦ at a net gain of 3%."
The preferred stock gained 3%.- The extent
of the public information when the stock mar
ket closed was contained in the formal state
ment by the Â¦ Gates element that they had
bought control of Louisville and Nashville and
that they proposed to leave the settlement of
the dispute to J. P. Morgan & Co. as arbiters.
This was accepted as Conclusive evidence that
Southern Railway would be benefited by the
settlement. The heavy buying of that stock
was by brokers usually employed by the In
side interests. But the volume of dealings was
sufficient Indication that everybody who could
get orders executed shared In the buying. The
movement in Illinois Central and in Chicago,
Indianapolis and Louisville was directly. In
sympathy with that In Southern Railway. It
is supposed that Illinois Central will be allowed
to share in the benefits of the Louisville and
Nashville absorption - and that" the- Chicago,
Indianapolis and Louisville will possibly form
a connecting link to Chicago. The very large
buying of St. Paul was supposed to be due
to a renewal of the campaign for a rise by the
element which bought Louisville and Nashville.
There was some strength it) the other, grangers
and Pacifies and In Pennsylvania and Balti
more and Ohio. Amalgamated Copper ad
vanced at one time over a point, but did not
hold it. There were notable advances in
specialties here and there. International Power
rising nearly 12 points. But Â¦ there were . also
points of weakness and outside of the con
gested centers of activity there was net a
notable demand for stocks. There was some
FtlffeQ*tiK of the money rate . again, but the
continued calmpess of the money market
through the dav relieved the apprehension that
was felt lest the enormous speculation should
develop a "stringency. The easing of the ex
change market Indicates that borrowing in for
eign markets was being frealy resorted to.

Eureka Summary â Rain for the past week
gre&tly interfered with farm work. Crops are
generally backward, but making good growth;
warm, sunshiny weather much needed. Pros
pects are good for an abundance of fruit.
Los Angeles Summary â Week warmer and
itiOre favorable for crop growth, though rain Is
beginning to be needed in places. Irrigation
bepur. and farm v.-ork settling down to sum
mer basis.
Southern California â The temperature was
beJ'jw normfii during the first of the week, but
warmer weather prevailed at the close. Rain
at the close cf the preceding week was very
beneficial to all crops. Grain and hay are in
pood ccndition. and fair crops are expected.
G; *-<:n feed is plentiful. A large .acreage of po
tatoes has been planted* at Anaheim, and the
cron is looking well. There will be a large In
crease in the sugar beet acreage In many
places. The acreage devoted to beans in Ven
tura County Is said to be much less than last
srp.Fon. FUgcr beets taking the place of beans.
Deciduous and citrus fruits are in good condi
tion. Owinu to an unusual abundance of wild
flowers In Kan Diego County the honey yield
wil! probably be the heaviest for years.
San Joaquin Valley â Warm days and cool
nifehts during the week have b^en favorable for
growing crops. Xo rain has fallen since last
Monday night, and there have been no inju
rious frnrts. Grain has made rapid growth,
an<1 prospects continue cood for a large yield.
Oats, and barley are heading out In many
places. The first crop of alfalfa is ready for
cntt'r-g. Green feed is plentiful. In the vi
cinity cf Reedlcy there has been a large tn
ciease in the acreage in vineyards and orch
ards a.r.d a corresponding decrease in grain
acreage. There is abundance ui water for ir
rigation, and orchardists expect unusually
heavy crops of nearly all varieties of deciduous
fruits. Citrus fruits and vineyards' are in
good condition.
Coart and Bay Sections â Conditions have
bo-r< favorable for ail crops during the week.
The temperature has been slightly above nor
mal, and no injurious frosts have occurred.
Light rain fell in 'â¢^rtions of the northern sec
tion at the beginning of the week, with hlith
wind in some places. Grain and hay are
makinpr good growth, but would be benefited
by rain in the southern districts. Prospects
continue good for large crops of wheat, barley
aTi-i oats. Early barley is heading cut in Lake
Co>:nty. Hay cutting has commenced ia San
Luis Obispo County. Hops and sugar beets
are doins well. 1'astarage is plentiful, and
stock is in good condition. There are a great
many Frnal! apricots in the orrhards of Santa
C.-ua County, and it is expected these will
diop. lf.iving enough of the good fruit to make
an average crop. Other deciduous fruits are
in good condition and citrus fruits are doing
well.
SsÂ«oramccto Valley â Warm weather has pre
vailed during the week and no rain has fallen.
Grain, alfalfa and hay are making rapid
growth, and the outlook for heavy crops has
never been better. The rain at close of last
week was beneficial to all crops, and enabled
farmers to resume plowing on the dry lands.
Work in orchards, vineyards and hop fields Is
progressing. Almonds are dropping in some
localities, but an average crop is expected.
AlitSeots Sn To!o County are doing better than
expected and will probably yield a fair crop.
Other deciduous fruits continue in good condi
tion and give promise of a heavy yield. Cit
rus fruits are thrifty. Olives are in bloom In
some places.
Deciduous fruits have not yet been serioujlr
injuicd by frost, and may be considered prac
tically safe for the season. . All varieties are in
bloom and petting rapidly and heavily. Thtrs
a.v>. seme indications of a short crop of apri
ccts. but all other fruits will probably yield
ir.ore than average crops. Citrus fruits are in
good condition.
The warm weather has been \ - ery beneficial
to grain and hay. and growth has been rapid
during the week. Early town grain is head
ing out in many places and locks well. Pros
pects were never better for heavy crops of
wheat, barley and oats in all the gram dis
trlcir. north of the Tehachapi, and fair crops
may be expected in all other sections if condi
tions continue favorable. Southern California
will need rain again very soon, as the warm
weather and winds will quickly absorb the
moisture in the soil and seriously affect the
grain crop. Haying has commenced in San
Luis Obirpo County, and the first crop of al
falfa in the San Joaquin Valley is ready for
harvest. Potato planting has commenced, and
Â¦wrrk is progressing in sugar beet and hop
lields. Irrigation water is plentiful.

FORECAST.
WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
It was assumed by the trade that export busi
ness would be upset for some time because of
the tax measure. After the weakness in corn
wore away somewhat and the fair weather re
ports .were offset to some fiegree by crop dam
age reports, heavy buying set In.,
Bradstrect' s reported a decrease of 3,360,000
bushels in the visible supply. Commission
houses had good orders anil shorts covered free
ly." The general sentiment turned very bullish.
In the last half-hour beiore the close May was
shoved up 2c from Its low-price for the day
and brought 74c. May closed strong, lV.@l%c
higher at 73%@74c- , / . ~
; Corn shorts were subjected to hard squeezing
to-day. There was plenty of stuff for sale early
on the break of 2c at St. .Louis. The situation
was almost the opposite of yesterday. Kansas
City denied a report of a sale of 300,000 bushels
cash there and the Southwest turned weak gen
erally. The market was nervous most of the
day, but gradually bears plucked up courage
and began selling short. Then came the bulge
In wheat and prices jumped upward Â¦ again as
the. shorts tried to cover. ,- The business â¢ trans
acted was not heavy. ; May corn Â¦ closed strong
at 03c, l%c higher than yesterday's close.,
Oats.were strong In ; sympathy ~, with "other
grains. "May closed firm, **Jc higher at 43c". ,
Provisions were strong early on the bullish
hog situation. Toward the : close prices eased
somewhat, but the. tone was generally strong.
May pork closed 10c up, lard a shade higher and
ribs 5@7%c up. : <â ;_ - â¢ y

speculators to the bear side. Northwestern re
ceipts. Â¦ however, 1 /, were almost 1 nothing and the
cash demand i was ' * much improved because
nearly everything was reported taken up. '. Corn
was. weakening,. and as . advices from London
stated - that buyers would i pay: the ; duties
through August and after that the duties would
be figured in 'the I contracts, the crowd turned
to sell a little. : May wheat opened unchanged
to a shade - higher at-72%c to 72%@72%c,
touched 72 %c and sold off to <2c. There was a
great discrepancy in cables. Liverpool early
cables were, as much, as Â¦ %c higher, and clos

The shipper who got up the car of Butter for
the East on Monday was after, another yester
day, and this imparted some steadiness to an
otherwise very weak â¢ market, as supplies, al
ready heavy, were increased by the largest re
ceipts this year. There are plenty of goods on
the market and dealers report Northern ordera
not more than half of what they have been of
late. Packing will soon begin, when there will
be less surplus hanging over the market. ,
; Cheese remains the same, being weak and
plentiful, with accumulating stocks.
Eggs as a rule are in very large supply, but
strictly fancy ranch are not as plentiful aÂ» the
medium and lower grades, and are bringing as
high as 16c in a small way. Everything not
gilt-edged, however, sells under this figure.
The gap between store and ranch always
widens at this time -of the year, when the
weather grows warm in the interior.
Receipts were 134,800 pounds. 2 kegs and 2S5
tubs of Butter, 2197 cases of Eggs, 6100 pounds
of California Cheese and pounds of East

At the Instance of George Metcalf, who
owns a row of buildings on Metcalf place,
off Geary, between Mason and Taylor,
they ejected Mrs. Kate Gilligan from her

her furniture over the sidewalk.
Metcalf claims that Mrs. Gilligan owes
l.irn four and a half months rent, that
the stopped up the sewer, costing him $30
â¢*io repair it. and refused to move although
served with a notice to vacate.
Mrs. Gilligan claims that Metcalf raised
the rent and that she was unable to pay
it. She says ehe had intended paying up
when she got the money. She also claims
that she has receipts showing that she
paid all the original rent up to date. She
denies having been troublesome and says

her.' Tbe deputies who removed her fur
niture climbed over the back fence about

Kate Mclntyre Creates a
Dramatic Scene in
Police Court.
Becomes Hysterical "When
Her Father Refuses to
Pardon Her.
All the details of the cowardly attack
upon James Mclntyre at his residence,
801A Bryant street, on the morning of
March 27 last were given in. Judge Mo
grin's court yesterday during the prelim
inary examination of Joseph Millian and
Charles Buchanan, who are charged with
burglary.
Mclntyre's daughter, Kate, who had
been living with Miliian in the Bruns
wick House, created a. scene when she
entered the courtroom. She came from
the City Prison, escorted by Policeman
Fontana. and looked around her in a de
fiant iranner until she saw. her father sit
ting in a front seat with his head in
bandages. She ran toward him scream
ing, and threw her arms around his neck,"
..sobbing hysterically. She asked him to
forgive her. but he turned away his head ,
and pushed her gently from him. One of
her brothers then tried to drag her away,
but iShe struggled fiercely with him until
the bailiffs came to his assistance, and
by order of the Judge she was led to
the Judge's chambers. After she had gone
the father burst into tears.
Boldly Defies the Judge.
The girl made another scene when she
was called to the witness stand. As she
passed Millian she said in a loud voice.
"1*11 stick to you, Joe." When she was
asked as to how long she had known
Millian, she looked toward him and said,
"It> about fifteen months, isn't it, Joe?"'
The Judge cautioned her not to address
.herself to Millian, and she retorted de
fiantly. "I dare you to stop me from
sneaking to him." Judge Mogan replied
that he would order her into custody -for
contempt, and she retorted, "I don't care
what you do. I'll speak to him when- 1
Ukc." Judge Mogan made the order of
contempt. overlooKing the fact that sue
was already in custody.
The girl brazenly admitted that she had
for months been talking with Millian
ar.d Buchanan about getting her father's
money, which he kept in a box in his
bedroom. On the night before the bur
glary. Millian and Buchanan made a
slugshot, but ehe got them to promise
that there would be no violence. Buch
anan had a revolver and she identified
the one found in Mlllian's room at the
Brunswick House as Buchanan's prop
erty.
Mclntyre TeUs of the Crime.
Uclntyre graphically detailed the - at
tempt upon his life, and the struggle
he had with Buchanan, whom he posi
tively identified. He said he was struck
on the back of the head while he was
facing Buchanan and knocked to the
floor. He did not see his assailant. The
struggle commenced in the kitchen aÂ«d
was continued into his bedroom, where
he kept a box with r.toout $500 in it. Buch
anan held a revolver to his face and told
him to throw up his bands. He said he
thought at first that Buchanan was fool-
Ing with him. but when a demand was
made for his money he began to realize
that Buchr.nan meant business. The club
wielder continued to beat him. till he be
came unconscious.
Mrs. Frankle Goodman, a waitress, who
lives in the Brunswick House, was an
important witness. She testified that she
knew Millian and Buchanan, arid that on
the night of March 28 she saw Millian sew
ing up something like a slungshot. Kate
Mclntyre told her about the burglary the
next day. She said she was present when
Millian and Kate Mclntyre were discuss
ing the attack upon the girl's father,
and Millian remarked, "I did it for you,
Kate, and will probably get the rope for
It." Kate replied, "If there Is a rope for
you. Joe, there will be a rope for me
too." Â¦ â¢
Mrs. C. Isele, who lives In the flat above
the Mclntvres. testified, to hearing a
noise in the Mclntyre flat and saw two
men running away. Although she would
not positively identify the defendants,
Â£he said she believed they were the men.
Her daughter. Marie Eorer. positively
identified Millian as the man she, saw
jump over a fence Into Hate street. Mrs.
Mary Owens and Chris Bantel, a boy,
living next door to the Mclntyre resi
dence, positively Identified Millian as toe
man who jumped over the fence. â¢ - !

hearing of the charge of assault ot mur

Venable and his . inamorata intend mak
ing another attempt when the sea calms
down. It Is doubtful, however, whether
Lupp . and Tucker will fulfill their part
of the contract, no matter how great the
monetary reward.
When Tucker and Lupp returned to
shore they felt ashamed of the part they
took in the matter. Lupp denied his
Identity, and Tucker refused to talk
until it dawned upon him that â¢ conceal
ment on his part might Incriminate him
still further.
Shortly after the party left the dock
the news of the" attempted wedding
spread along the water front. Indignant
citizens agreed that the. couple should be
given a fitting .welcome Â¦ on their return,
and decayed eggs and fruit were* con
tracted for and moved to the dock. "When
storekeepers learned what the stun! was
for they refused . to accept money, and
furnished ammunition... with a lavish
hand. Luckily .'for Â¦ Venable â¢ and his
charmer, Â¦ they did - not return to the
wharf. Boatman. Tucker and the pseudo
minister assisted them to - land at Har
bor -View- Â¦ . , â¢Â¦Â¦-Â¦..
O'Donnell alluded to the attempt upon
the part of M. L. Venable, a colored man,
to marry Evelyn Taylor, a white wo
man. The attempt : to evade the laws
of the State was frustrated through the
illness of the woman. At the moment
when she was to have said the words
that would bind her to the man of ebony
hue she became seasick. She begged the
boatman to steer for calmer water, and
Frederick Lupp, former second officer of
the ill-fated Walla Walla, lost his fee as
official "splicer." Lupp was to have per
formed , the marriage ceremony : which
was to bind the couple together for life.
At 7:30 o'clock -yesterday, morning : .the
fair Desdnmona and her Othello' visited
the wharf.. They, tried "to secure the ser
vices of various boatmen, but all de
clined to aid them. -M. A. Tucker finally
undertook the contract. He secured the
services of Lupp, > and the bridal couple
departed for the heads in a leaky I gas
oline launch. Besides steering the launch,
Tucker was to act as best man, and Lupp
was to be the "sky pilot."
"Say, on der level, der -wedding of der
Chinee and "der coon was a society event
compared to der attempted nuptials on
der high seas between dat colored guy and
