The Daily Telegraph this morning says
that. when King Edward was told that an
operation was imperative, he exclaimed:
"Operation or no operation. I won't dis
appoint the people. I must go to the
Abbey."
LONDON, June 25.â When spoken to
in the earlier stages of his illness
as to the advisability of postponing
the coronation, the King said: "I
v.ill attend the coronation or die for it."
DETERMINED
TO ATTEND THE
CORONATION
When white coronation robes were de
cided on, it was pointed out that they
had only been used on three occasions,
and curiously enough, each wearer came
to a violent end. Richard II was crq/vned
In white satin. The next was the un
fortunate Henry VI. Despite the strong
persuasion of the Earl of Pembroke,
Charles I., was also invested at his cor
onation in white satin.
There have been few omens of a gloomy
kind, except the persistent rain in Eng
land which disarranged the programme
of the King's engagements. It has "been
made a subject of comment that
June 26. the day selected for the
coronation, is the anniversary of the
death of George IV. The same day
was chosen for the coronation of
Queen Victoria, but she insisted that
It be deferred until June 28. It was also
pointed out by the superstitious that in
the programme of Friday's procession In
the thirteenth carriage were to be seated
Duke D'Aosta, of Italy; Arch-Duke Fran
cis Ferdinand, of Austria, and hereditary-
Grand Duke Michael of Russia, all rep
resentatives of dynasties who have felt
the hand of the assassin.
Cheiro. a palmist, who claimed to have
predicted Queen Victoria's death six
months before it happened, in July, 1900,
said King Edward would be killed in
May or June, 1901. An attempt was to be
made upon his life by socialists, accord
ing to this prediction, which of course,
did not turn out to be true.
"Raphael." a London astrologer, at the
beginning of the present year, said the
planets were unfavorable to King Ed
ward, and he added: "Let great care be
taken of his Majesty's health and per
son." Another astrologer, who called
himself "Zadkiel" ; drew a horoscope of
the King at the time of his birth in 1S41.
Jt was a non-committal kind that might
be twisted by the superstitious into a pre
diction of what has happened, but no de
tails were given.
Henrietta Couesdan, who pretended to
be able to talk with the Angel Gabriel
and who attracted much attention in
Paris in 1896. is said to have predicted
that King Edward would not reign long
and that he -would die In 1902 after a
"surgical operation." Mlie. Couesdan at
the same time predicted that the German
Lmperor would meet a violent death in
1&02.
The prophecy that gave the King the
rr.ost uneasiness was made at the time of
ms birth and ran as follows: "King shall
Edward be, but never shah be crowned."
As the date pt the coronation approached
nis thoughts recurred with increasing fre
quency, it is said, to this prophecy.
Another prediction was made by a
irypsy crone in London before Queen Vic
toria's death. The woman had achieved
some fame by making predictions which
had been proved true in regard to other
reigning families in Europe. She said:
"The Prince of Wales will be killed as
soon as a great honor has been conferred
upon him."
especially Â¦ frequent during
the last year. The time for the fulfill
ment of some of them has passed, but
others are still pending and his failure to
recover from the operation certainly
â¢would be regarded by believers In prophe
cies as another proof of their value.
That ihe King himself was not oblivious
to the words of the prophets and that he
was not free from forebodings has been
mentioned often as a trait of his char
acter. Ever since the deatfi of Queen Vic
toria, it is said, he has been haunted by
a superstitious fear that he would not
live to be crowned. Reports have been
current In London since his accession that
he often brooded over predictions of evil
â¢that had been made about him and that
he was unable to shake his mind free of
them.

VICTORIA, B. C, June 24.â The pro

State ceremonies in connection with the
coronation on Thursday afternoon. NrÂ»
decision has been arrived at respecting
the naval and military review on Thurs
day, morning. The societies* union an
nounced for Friday has, like the other 5
coronation celebration events, been can

Rear Admiral Blckford this evening re
ceived a cablegram from the Admiralty 1
canceling the order for the naval and
military review which /was to have been
held here on Thursday in honor of the
King's celebration.
"It was at Aldershot last Sunday week
when his Majesty suffered from his first
acute seizure. Sir Francis Laking. M. D.,
one of the physicians in ordinary of the
King's household, diagnosed the case as
one of intestinal trouble. Sir Frederick
Treves, honorary sergeant surgeon to his
Majesty, and Sir Thomas Barlow, physi
cian to his Majesty's household, were im

Laking's diagnosis, and both advised that
the coronation be abandoned. The King
was obdurate, however, and insisted upon
his removal to . Windsor. His Majesty
said that he would take all the responsi

r^k I special from London says: From
I a well informed authority at
A N court the World correspondent
obtained this evening the inside
history of the King's illness. He said:
KING IMPERILS
HIS HEALTH
FOR SUBJECTS
"The illness of King Edward only leaves
room in English hearts for anxious emo
tion. The suffering sovereign is always
a friend to France, and we respectfully
associate ourselves with the sadness of
his subjects and still more so with their
hopes."
The Gaulois says:
"Edward was the King of fashion be
fore he became King of England. The
kingdom of fashion is the whole of Eu
rope, and Paris is its capital. Edward
knew his capital and his kingdom well,
and he was popular in both before he
ascended the throne of England."
The Figaro says
they have difficulty In concealing lieir
anxiety at the danger which .will
hang over the King's life for some
days to come. They exhort the
public to abandon all ideas of festiv
ity and to return soberly to the dUles
of every-day existence as most befttlnu
the dignity of the nation.
The Daily Telegraph says:
"The country ,will bear one more infic
tion with all its sorrow, deprivation ard
infinite untowardness, as it has many
times before borne troubles wruen tor
the time seemed overwhelming."
The Standard says that the- message ot
condolence from President Roosevelt will
be "gratefully accepted as a token that
our friends and well-wiahers abroad synv
lathizfe with us in a calamity which at
best must impose an unwonted strain on
the patience and fortitude of the nation."
The Daily Telegraph this morning says
that when King Edward was told that
an operation was imperative he ex
claimed:
"Operation or no operation, I will not
disappoint the people. I must go to the
Abbey."
PAKJS, June 25.â The Paris papers this
morning give jrreat prominence to the
accounts of the illness of King E.l
ward. These are accompanied by expres
sions of the deepest sympathy with Great
Britain "in the sudden change from the
anticipated rejoicing3 of coronation to
the arfliction and anxiety caused by the
dangerous illness of the country's beloved
p.nd popular monarch, who has just been
the main instrument in giving it the bless

and the King's physicians and to learn to

while the vast congregation knelt rever

similar to the one held there was also held

PRAISES KING
AND THE LATE
QUEEN VICTORIA
*- ONDON, June 25.â Of the scene in
I the House of Commons upon the
JL~4 announcement of the illness of King
Edward, T. P. O'Connor, Irish-Na
tionalist member and president of the
Irish National League, has written the
following account for the Associated
Press:
"The workaday world goes on in its
usual way, whatever tragedy be in the
air, and this Is especially true of the
House of Commons, which even yet is
bound down with the iron rules that no
high destiny or national crisis can un
bind. And thus it was to-day, when the
whole world of London was shaken by
the announcement of the postponement
of the coronation and the serious Illness
of the King, for which everybody was
waiting to see the Ministers Â«nter and
hear some news one way or the other,
a clerk at a table read out the words of
a petition from a provincial town, coun
cil in reference to the pending education
al bill. The educational bill is Important,
but to have this petition with its dreary
tautology read when the fate of the mon
arch was in the balance was one of those
grotesque contradictions which exasper
ated and finally grated on the nerves of
the House. But as the clerk read.stolid
ly on in a muffled voice, the house began
at last to interrupt him with discordant
and even indecorous cries, and while the
House was thus descending Into undigni
ned disorder, the Ministers were still ab-.
sent from their places and the House was
still left without news.
"But in spite of all this, and In spite of
-even the discordant and grotesque shouts.
Where was that about the place which
showed that something was in the air that
affected and frightened men. It is no ex
aggeration to say that there was a look
of far more profound depression about tne.
House than even in those awful and trying
hours for Englishmen when the disasters
of Colenso and Spionkop seemed to make
the whole fabric of the empire reel. Many
of the members looked positively broken
hearted. They entered the House as if
illness were theirs and as if a blow had
fallen upon them.
"The local petition was at last finished,
the cries ceased and there fell a somber
and solemn stillness on the House when
Mr Balfour and the other Ministers filed
in Spontaneously and universally hats
were taken off when Mr. Balfouf rose and
announced that he had a message to de
liver in reference to the King. The House
of Commons looks its best and Its most
Impressive when it is thus uncovered. It
is the custom for hats to be kept on, and
therefore the mere act of uncovering
heads gives to the familiar place a cer
tain unusualness of look and a certain
solemn exaltation, and so it was to-day
when Mr. Balfour arose. Mr. Balfour is
not a man"*wno ever shows much feeling,
and it is said of him by some of his most
severe critics that he has much sentiment,
but no feeling.
"To-day, however, nobody could deny
that for once Mr. Balfour seemed to be
.moved, and It was with something of a
break in his voice that he announced the
seriousness of the King's condition and
the fact that the operation had been al
ready performed. There was* no display
of feeling until Mr. Balfour came to the
point where he foreshadowed tho state
ment that the surgeons were nopfful of
the result. It was an evidence' cf how
keen was the feeling that he was not al
lowed to conclude his sentence. There
was an anticipatory and big outburst of
cheers from all parts of the House.
"Mr. Balfour's statement occupied but
a few moments and It was followed by a
few words from Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman, the leader of the opposition, and
liie whole scene. was over. It took bat a.
m J EW YORK, June 24.â Dr. Cyrus
l\ Edson explained the King's illness
Â¦*â¢ ' al\d the operation as follows:
â¢"Perityphlitis is inflammation,
including the formation of' an abscess of
the tissues around the vermiform appen
dix, and hence perityphlitis is hard to dis
tinguish at once from appendicitia. Usu
ally an operation is necessary to ascer
tain whether the appendix or the sur
rounding tissue is diseased. In the King's
case there is probably an abscess at the
head of the large intestine where. the ap
pendix begins and the operation to-day
was an immediate necessity, because the
abscess had to be got at at once and
emptied of its contents or pus. Of course,
. I cannot say what further than the
abscess was discovered by the surgeonsâ
that is, to what extent the inflammation
had affected that part of the King's body.
Under ordinary circumstances he ought to
recover In three or four weeks, but after
recovery it would be perhaps four weeks
more before he would be able to perform
his part of the coronation ceremonies.
The King's trouble is in his right side,
low down." f
Perityphlitis, the malady from which
King Edward Is suffering, is an acute
form of appendicitis. The medical diction
ary defines the disease as the acute in
,fiammation of the connective. tissues sur
rounding the caecum. It is pronounced
very dangerous, but not necessarily fatal.
An operation is necessary in most cases
to- cure the patient who suffers from it
In an interview Dr. Samuel Gardner
said:
"Perityphlitis is diagnosed as an acute
form of appendicitis and is considered a
most dangerous disease. It differs from
appendicitis In the fact that the head of
the colon, or longest division of the in
testinal organs, becomes infected, while
appendicitis affects only the appendix, a
small projection of the colon.
"The disease may be caused from an in
jury of the intestinal organs, or it may be
contracted in the same way appendicitis
is' generally brought on. Inflammation of
the colon often sets in and, this has also
been known to result fri perityphlitis.
Acute dysentery may also bring on the
disease. Perityphlitis is uncommon and is
considered extremely dangerous by medi
cal men. It is not necessarily fatal, as I
have known of several cases that have
been cured in this city within the past
few months." t
-Dr. Bazet said the malady 5 was fatal in
a great many cases, but tne patient al
ways had a chance to survive, it.

few moments and but for the general air
of the House, to which I have alluded, the
scene was not impressive.
"The House then went on with the dis
cussion of the educational bill in its many
details, somberly, but regularly and pro
saically, as if nothing had occurred. But
there was a certain llfelessness in it all*
and as is usual when something tragic is
in the air the real life of the House was
in the lobbies and not on the floor. The
members gathered in groups and King
Edward was the one topic of conversa
tion. There was nothing but regret and
sympathy; the tragic elements of- the
case broke down all barriers, and men
only thought of the. suffering fellow man
struck down at the moment when, it
ever, the hand of cruel fate ought to have
been stayed. â¢ }'Â¦ \
"The excitement was brought to a cli
max when a report spread like wildfire
that the King was sinking, and this was
soon followed by a report Â¦ that -his
Majesty was actually dead. A shiver as
of the passing of the -Angdâd* ~I>ea.th
then passed over everybody, - and â¢ the
members of the House rushed hither and
thither, but with that characteristic
quiet Â¦ and apparent want of Â¦ . emotion
which Englishmen so rarely lose. . Â¦
"The place to go at that moment for the
latest information was the House of
Lords. The false report of King Edward's
death came at twenty minutes past 4
o'clock, and at half past 4 the House of
Lords began its sitting. There was an un
usually full attendance, and so many la
dies pressed for admittance that they had
to be remonstrated with by the attend
ants, and the poor things were rather
hustled. The peers had to begin, like the
Commons, with some commonplace busi
ness, .the reading in dumb show of some
documents and other trivialities, but this
did not last long. Lord Spencer is .now
the leader of .the Liberal party in the
House of Lords; the Earl of Kimberley is
dead and Lord RoseDery has retired.
"To-day when. Lord Spencer arose he
was pallid and evidently unnerved. He
asked the' question with just a sentence
and a half of sympathy, after the terse
fashion of Englishmen. Lord Salisbury
was \more lengthy. Indeed, to tell the
truth, he appeared to many as if he were
clumsily looking around for words and as
if his usual felicity of language had de
serted him.
v "It was not a very impressive- scene,
but was thought to be rather more strik
ing than the scene in the House of Com
mons, and here comes one of the little
ironies of life:
"Tea on the terrace, one of London's
most fashionable gatherings, has been al
most abolished this year by .the bad
weather. To-day the sun was blazing,
with the result that the ladles came out
like butterflies after a shower and never
was the terrace so thronged, so gay and
so tumultuous as on this day of fright
and grief. There was something mourn
ful as well as striking In the scene and if
anything were wanting to make it more
mournful it was the gay bunting, the
Venetian masts and the glaring colors of
the decorations on Westminster bridge,
which cuts the skyline from the terrace.
"The flags flapped lazily in the sultry
air, the vast crowds passed slowly by. the
huge and groaning buses which stood in
rows of six and seven at a time. Tho
tide of life flowed on strong and tumult-"
uous, and the King Is fighting with
death."

In some .branch of the profession.
Sir Francis Henry Laklng is the fore
most figure in London's medical world.
He is a surgeonyjf rare skill. He is "phy
sician in ordinary and surgeon apothecary
to the King," also "apothecary to his
Majesty's household."
Sir Joseph Lister was surgeon extra

pointed to the same position by King Ed
ward. He has been professor of clinical
surgery in various colleges, and is fam
ous for his discovery of the antiseptic
treatment In surgery.
Sir Thomas Barlow, physician extraor
dinary, held the same position under
Queen Victoria. He is professor of clin
ical medicine in University College Hos
pital.
Dr. Frederick Treves won for himself
at an unusually early age a place among
the greatest masters of surgery. He be
came a member of the Royal College of
Surgeons in 1874, and soon gained further
fame as an authority on abdominal oper
ations.

BULLETINS ON
THE CONDITION
OF THE KING
-_T . 0ND0N. June 21â Senator De
. ff pew, when I saw him at the
B Â¦ Carlton Hotel this evening,
B â¢ compared the effect of the
K news, of the King's illness upon
-**-^^ London, with the effect of the
news of the assassination of
President McKlnley upon Buffalo last
year. "|
~"It is a serious thing," said Depew. "It
is an exact parallel in many respects with
the incidents at Buffalo, although the ele
ment of tragedy is wanting. I was in Buf
falo at the time and the city was in just
such a state of exultation and exaltation
as London was this morning. There as
here one saw everywhere people enjoying
themselves. Here, from coster to peer,
the whole population yas anticipating the
crowning of the King. - Happy â¢ crowds
were everywhere and people were ap
plauding and cheering the decorations
which especially appealed to them.
"Looking out of my window just .when
the news was being given outl saw a dra
matic sight. There was a tremendous
congestion of persons and vehicles In Pall
Mall, which lasted fully fifteen minutes.
Suddenly the news vender was seen, who
held aloft a huge poster of one of the
newspapers bearing the words, Corona
tion postponed; King very ill.' In a min
ute the whole crowd had dissolved and
soon the street was occupied only by of
dinary traffic.
"One thing that strikes one most forc
ibly at this time," said the Senator, "is
the immense popularity of the King. Not
a single discordant note, and I have talk
ed with many distinguished men-,, have
I heard- in .the general chorus of sorrow
for the King's illness."
"This is a very disastrous calamity,
which will touch the hearts of people all
over the world," said General Joseph
Wheeler. ""AH people have a deep sym
pathy.for those who, just about receiving
great honors, are suddenly prostrated.
The entire world* hopes for the King's

DESCRIPTIVE:

The news was startling, notwithstanding
the fact that reports of the King's serious

several days were credited here.
Many prominent Government officials to

TON, June 24.â The President,
Just before leaving 'the White
House for the railroad station,
sent the following cablegram to
King Edward:
His Majesty Edward VII, London: I ask
your Majesty to accept my sincere assurances
of sympathy and wishes for speedy conva
lescence. THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
In President Roosevelt's cablegram to
King Edward is contained the sentiment
of the sympathy felt by all Washington
since the grave news of the King's seri
ous condition and the coronation's post
ponement was heralded in the streets to
day. This feeling is especially marked on
the part of the officials of the State De
partment, . who have regarded the ap
proaching coronation as the greatest dip
lomatic event of modern times, and on
the part of those diplomats who still re
main here and who If ear world-wide politi
cal complications should the lllniss of his
Majesty result seriously.
"I feel what I will not attempt to de
scribe, the feelings ! under which we â¢ re
ceived the sad news to-day. It is the
most appalling event that could have been
conceived of by any one. Never was
London anticipating so ' bright and bril
liant a pageant as it was during the last
few weeks In anticipation of the corona
tion of the King. Never were so many
princes and potentates gathered together
to do honor to one man. London is full
of people who yesterday were joyously
anticipating the pageantry of Thursday
next, and it is full to-night of sorrowing
and weeping men and women.

been assigned the duty of the entertain
ment of special embassadors to the cor
onation, Reid went to Buckingham Palace
and found the King just rallying from, the
operation. He was doing nicely and had
escaped the usual shock attendant upon
such operations. Reid, stated that the
coronation had gone over without date
and that the ceremonies arranged-for.to
morrow had been declared off. Signs of
sorrow, he cabled, were everywhere vis
ible in London. From. Henry "White, sec
retary of the United States Embassy in
London, a cable dispatch was received by
Dr. Hill to the effect that the coronation
was postponed indefinitely, but that It
could not occur within at least two i
months, and that all ceremonies attend-,'
ant upon it had been, called off, with the
exception of the King's . dinner ' to the
poor, which will take place on Saturday.
Until the date to which the coronation
will be postponed is set, the department
here Is unable to say what will be the di
rections issued to Reid and members of
the special embassy from this country to
the coronation. Such plans will rest
largely with the pleasure <of Reid himself.

To every one who writes in good faith
I -will send the full formula of this won-

full directions are sent free. Have it
filled, or If you desire, you can buy the
remedies and prepare it privately Just
as well yourself. One prescription will
make a new man of you. One dose will
be enough to convince you of Its marvel-
ous power.
Among those whose attention has been
cttracted by this magnanimous offer Is
the Rev. J. S. B. Crawford of Wayns-
vilie, N. C, a very prominent divine,
whose own vitality was seriously Im-
paired. Being sick of paying money to
cuacks and charlatans who took his
money without doing Mm any good, Mr.
Crawford had the prescription made up
And took it regularly, as he was directed. !
TTith this result, he was perfectly cured,
and rfter several years of enjoyment of
We newly given powers, made the state-
ment publicly that e\ - ery man in need of
help should do likewise.
There are not many ministers who
Â¦would be willing to publicly indorse and
recommend a cure of this kind, with the
etatement that they themselves had been
cured by It, but the Rev. Crawford has
in him a great deal of true gratitude and
love of mankind. This is shown In a re-
cent letter in which he says that he
makes public acknowledgment "in order
that others may receive the same happy
results."

snouia tne contractors ignore the
brotherhood carpenters next week, about
J600 men will be thrown out of work. As
there are less than 2300 carpenters now at
work in this city, it will be set=n that
building operations must necessarily be
cericusly handicapped. That all of the
crafts connected with the building trades
will be affected goes without saying. The
millmen have announced their intention
to- stand by the Building Trades Council,
vrhile on the other hand the stairbuilders
are backing up the brotherhood. I Serious
complications are bound to arise, and if
the j Labor Council, . with which the
brotherhood unions are affiliated, takes a
hand in the business, a general strike,
which will affect and possibly cripple the
building trades in all their branches, may
result-
The brotherhood men have already been
advised by the district council that strike
benefits will be allowed to all union, men
who are discharged by the contractors by
reason of the fact that the men have no

I understand the Building Trades Council will
now withdraw that objectionable clause in sec
tion 8, article 2. of their constitution. Thai
may be one means of solving the difficulty, but
when they iaslst that the question of affiliation
with any central body -be left to a majority
vote of all the carpenters in the city and county
of San Franciscc to decide, I cannot agree to
that part. The decision of the G. E. B. in the
matter is the decision that should be respected
and obeyed. Our local unions have the right
to affiliate with -any central body, provided
their laws do not conflict with ours. Tours.
FRANK DUFFT.
I Quite agree that the District Council could
not submit the proposition made by the
builders to a referendum vote.: You have taken
a position and the G. E. B. will stand by you
ln that position, and it is now the duty of the
loyal locals to stand by that decision, no mat
ter what the results may be.
L. Lester Edner. secretary District Council â
Dear Sir and Brother: I have carefully con
sidered your letter under date of June 4 and
the set of resolutions adopted by the Builders'
Association, with a view of settling the con
troversy between the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners of America and the
Building Trades Council of San Francisco.
A meeting of the brotherhood unions
has been called for Monday evening next,
at v.hich time the situation will be thor
oughly canvassed- and u plan of campaign
ouuino.d. The senumtnt among the brotn
t:huocl men is fctrongly in favor of mak
ing a vigorous light, even if such a course
brings about a general strike among the
builcring trades.' . . â¢ â¢ . Â¦ Â¦
The contractors Fay they will not rÂ«c
cgJiize the brotherhood men after July 1,
bectusc il is their beat judgment that it :s
lo their interests to employ only such
men at are affiliated with the "Building
Trades Council. They say, too. that
ihey are not epposed to the brotherhood
carpenters merely because they are bat
tling against tne Building Trades Council,
but because the power of the council in
the local building field is such that the
contractors cannot afford to ignore it in
favor of a. body of men who. have only
their affiliation with a national organiza
tion to support their claims. The brother
hood men refused to submit the proposi
tion of rescinding an objectionable clause
of the constitution of the Building Trades
Council to a vote of all the carpenters
and the contractors affect to regard this
us a means of escaping a vote, which
might result in their defeat^
BROTHERHOOD IS FIRM.
The District Council Brotherhood
of Carpenters met lastMnSQQfhd received
the following commumHftion from Gen
eral Secretary Frank Duffy of the broth
erhood at Philadelphia relative to the
trouble. The communication is dated
June 15:
The Brotherhood of Carpenters declare*
its determination to fight a strong battle
should the contractors carry out their
threat to stand by the Building Trades
Council to the decree they say they will.
They have the bacKing of the Labor Coun
cil, which body at a recent meeting in
dorsed the siand taken by the brother
hood and gave assurances of .support
when ihe lijrlu is" fairly on.
Serious trouble IrT'the' building" trades,
when the armistice agreed upon between
the contractors and carpenters comes to
an end on July 1, is generally regarded as
likely., On the date mentioned the con
tractors will refuse to recognize or em
ploy carpenters who have not the working
card of the Building Trades Council, and
with this action, trouble, the end of
which jio man can foresee, seems inevi

The wholesale dealers in linseed on, tur,
pentine and lead in this city are having
the warmest time in all their trade ex
perience. Every dealer is making an open
rate on these commodities on his own ac
count, all because the gentlemen's agree
ment among them to preserve certain
prices has been violated, and a trade wa<
has been inaugurated which may com
tine a long time and. Involve other arti
cles offered for sale in the same general
lines. To-day a purchaser of one barrel
of linseed oil can secure. the oil as cheap
ly as if he bought 1000 barrels. The sam<*
open conditions obtain in relation to tha
market quotations for turpentine, lead}
and litharge. In all the downtown prints
ing offices circulars are daily in prepara
tion containing Individual announcements
of the several firms engaged In the oil
and lead business. These circulars ara
greedily grabbed up by the retail trade.
the members of which are watching thfÂ»
developments keenly and buying wner*
they can make the most saving as com
pared with the former prides.
In this the retailers are supposed to bq
making hay while the sun shines. aU
though there- are no wholesalers who caa
be found to hazard a prediction as M
whether the cutting of prices will con
tinue long or will suddenly cease. In tha
meantime the circulars are like war bul
letins to the trade. In the strife such
large concerns as the Standard Oil Com
pany and the Pacific Linseed Oil ami
Lead Works are taking part. These tw.Â»
have been- supplying the jobbers with thÂ»
goods to be distributed among the retail
trade. On Friday of last week they re
ceived letters from the secretary of tha
parties to the gentlemen's agreement in
which it was diplomatically announced
that one unnamed party to the agree
ment had seen fit to refuse to contlnua
and therefore the rates could not be main
tained.
Up to that time and during a period
of years the jobbers had been allowed a
differential of 5 cents on linseed oil. Tha
Standard Oil Company and the Pacific Oil
and Lead Works prepared at once tq
shade off their price lists to meet the new
conditions. One day left only a 1-cent
differential. The Standard Oil Company
was the more aggressive and wiped out
the entire differential In favor of the job
bing trade on Monday of the present
week and the other supply house imme
diately followed suit. So it happened that
yesterday the retailer could buy from tho
supply houses just as cheaply a9 could
the jobbers and fur or oil flew, along tha
entire line.
As indicating the general conditions, a
circular that was issued by Yates & Co.
and that was eagerly perused by tha
trade, jobbing and retail alike, is inter
esting. Pure raw linseed oil in barrels
was quoted at 71 cents per gallon and in,
cases at 76 cents: boiled linseed oil' in
barrels.^ent at '73 cent&i-pvr gallon *ifcnct
7S cents in cases.- The grading: in rates
according to quantities, purchased^ of
white lead, according to. the -game circu
lar, was seen to have almost entirely Sis
appeared. There were but two condition*
specified. One applied to 500 pounds and
upward and the other to less than Cuu
pounds. < ... . - -
. Parties who have new buildings or old
ones to decorate will be able to save
money by buying lead and oil while the
war lasts, and this will cause the effects
of the outbreak to be felt for some time.
There are two explanations as' to the or
igin of the disagreement. . One is that
outside oil was brought in. and -was sur
reptitiously,, sold at low, rates to get tha
market. The other is that the goods reg
ularly procured from' the -local - supply
houses were deliberately slaughtered.
There is considerable heat Â¦ under this
seemingly, spontaneous combustion and
hard names are not infrequent when the
origin of the oil and lead war is dis
cussed.
Jobbers Are Having Exciting
Experiences All Along

a- plain trail led through the woods and

be is not known, but from questions ask

that it will be a plea of insanity.

crime. Sheriff Mansfield asked Briggan
if he was at home all of the previous
day, and Briggan replied that he was.
They then went into the house. The floor
was damp, as though it had been scrub

about, and Briggan explained that he had
been troubled with nosebleed.
"Yesterday morning about 8 o'clock,"
said Briggan. "He took his things and
went off up- the road."
"Good morning, Joe; I understand you
have had trouble up here. They say you

Chief of Police Wittman yesterday re
ceived la telegram from J.C Morroe, City
Marshal of Sedro Wooley, Wash., stating
that a. man had given himself up and con
fessed that he was Bennett, the murderer
of Nora Fuller. Not much importance
was attached to the. message by the po
lice, but a full description of Charles B.
Hadley was telegraphed to the northern
officer, . Â¦
What object the Sedro Wooley prisoner
has in palming himself off as the murder
er of Nora Fuller can only be conjectured.
He is believed to be either insane, a seek
er of notoriety or a man looking for a
free trip to California. There is said to
be but slight resemblance between the
prisoner and the published description of
Charles B. Hadley. Incidentally, the fel
lcw has not mentioned the name of Had
ley, who is supposed to be the real John
Bennett. . , . .
Bennett will not mention any names of
San Francisco persons whom he alleges
had a hand in the young girl's death. He
says when the proper time arrives he
will tell a story that will be the sensa
tion of two continents.
"Where I made a fool of myself was In
permitting myself to be rushed out of San
Francisco and thus fasten the onus of the
blame upon me. Certainly I was to blame
for mixing up in the dreadful mess at the
first, but there tfre others higher up In the
social and professional scale than I could
ever hope to be who will now have to suf
fer for the grewsome sin of the dreadful
affair."
Bennett talked freely to-day on the gen
eral text of the Nora Fuller tragedy, but
guardedly as to some of the details. He
declared' that the young girl was not
strangled and hinted that her death wos
caused by a criminal operation. The
guilty man, said the prisoner, was a prom
inent San Francisco physician, who was
engaged 'by persons high in . the social
scale of the Calitornia metropolis. The
pretended Bennett declares he was but
the Â¦ scapegoat for these men. of high
standing, and he intimates that they have
kept him plentifully supplied with money.
' "When I arrived here," he said, "I made
up my mind that I must either relieve
myself by making a clean breast of things
or go crazy. I want to shift the responsi
bility f gr the murder from my shoulders
to where it belongs. The newspapers have
been on the wrong track since the start.
There was no strangulation, no poisoning.
That is all I will say just now about th3
cause of Nora Fuller's death. Yes, John
Bennett is my proper name, although I
have been j traveling under the name of
John Flex. I am a printer by trade. I
was formerly connected with a newspaper

SEATTLE, June 24.â According to ad
vices received from Sedro Wooley to
night, the authorities of that little place
are growing less confident that they have
John Bennett, or Charles B. Hadley, the
alleged murderer of Nora Fuller, in cus
tody. The putative Bennett, who surren
dered to the town marshal . yesterday,
declaring- that' he" was weary of evading
the law's minions, has been telling so
many conflicting stories that the possibil
ity that' He is tne man he pretends to bs
is very remote. His. statements do. not
at all /accord with the details of the San
Francisco crime as they are known to the
police; in fact, in some respects there
is such a wide variance as to make it
seem that fhe Sedro Wooley prisoner had
not even read the newspapers carefully
before telling his story to Town Marshal

BOGUS BENNETT'S
TALES CONFLICT
Kerrick never informed the State of
California of the defect in the wall of the
prison, and when he told an acquaintance
about it not long ago he said he was quite
sure that It had not been discovered and
that any one incarcerated In that particu
lar cell could easily escape.
That evening something happened which
saved him the trouble of breaking out of
the prison. A pardon for him arrived. An
uncle had" died a few days before and on
his deathbed had confessed that â¢ he had
committed the murder for which Kerrick
was sentenced.
In the construction of a corner cell he
managed to place a large three-cornered
stone in such a manner that by loosening
the mortar it could be shoved out, leaving
a hole large enough for a man to crawl
through. When the work on the prison
was so far advanced that the convict*
could be locked in the newly completed
cells, Kerrick got permission to occupy
that particular cell.
Kerrick was once a life prisoner in San
Quentin, Cal., and it is an incident of his
confinement there that has just been given
publicity. He had been convicted of a
murder and narrowly escaped lynching.
That was before the establishment of the
prison at Folsom. Kerrick was taught the
trade of a stone mason and became quite
expert. When the building of Folsom
prison was begun Kerrick was sent to as
sist in the masonry and was made a fore
man. This gave him an opportunity to
plan for his escape.
, PHOENIX, Ariz., June 24.â A revelation
was made here to.-day which may prove
to be of Interest to the authorities of Fol
som prison. Three years ago James Ker
rick, who had been implicated in several
cattle stealing cases in the neighborhood
of Gila Bend, was convicted and sent to
Tuma. Before the end of the year he was
released on parole, the principal condition
being that he should leave the Territory
and stay out of it. *

It is said the board did not mince mat
ters with Warden Wilkinson, but told him
plainly that the prison would have to-be
run upon a different plan. It is said
the directors gave Wilkinson to under
stand he would be given one more chance.
The directors do not want to cause the
removal of the "Warden at this time, as
he only has a little more than a year to
serve in that position. " . , Â¦
There were a number of other com-,
plaints which had been brought to the
attention of the Board of Prison Direc
tors. Several members of the board were
at the prison last week, before the meet
-ing of Saturday. They went to investi
gate affairs in their own way, and it is
understood they gathered considerable
material.
It was also claimed the Warden was
in the habit of stopping the, mail carrier
between the prison and Folsom and look
ing over the contents of the pouch before
it was delivered to Postmaster Smith.
The latter, who is clerk of the board,
threw up his job as Postmaster.
During the past winter and spring sto
ries of cruelty on the part of the Warden
have floated out of the prison. Among
other things, it' has been alleged that the
Warden has been unnecessarily severe in
the manner of punishing prisoners for
breaking the rules of the institution. It
was also said that he did riot give them
enough food and that they did not have
sufficient Â¦ clothing to keep them warm
during the winter months. In one in
stance, it has been claimed, a prisoner
had died in his cell, where he had been
thrown with a straitjacket laced tightly
about his body.
The only morsel the scribes got was
the resolution declaring that convicts
should no longer. be permitted to tamper
or juggle with claims against the State.
But some Of the facts about the executive
session have come to light, and they were
published in the Bee this evening. That
paper says its information is most relia

CENSURING
THE WARDEN
OF FOLSOM
REDWOOD CITY, June 24.â The pre
liminary examination of. Dairyman Jo
seph Briggan, charged with the murder
of Joseph Mattle, his hired man,
was held before Justice of the Peace
James Hannon to-day. I Briggan was
held to answer before the Superior Court
and committed to the custody of the
Sheriff without bail. The testimony
showed: that the crime with which the
defendant stands charged was one of the
most brutal ever committed in San Ma
teo County. The prosecution examined
but four witnesses, merely enough testi
mony being introduced to warrant the
holding of the defendant, but such evi
dence as' .was Â¦ offered was damaging to
Briggan.
. The hatchet with which the murder
was probably committed was brought into
court by Sheriff Mansfield and introduced
in evidence.
Dr. J. L. Ross, the 1 autopsy physician,
described the various wounds upon
the body of Mattle, some of which were
made with the blunt end of an instru
ment and others with a sharp edge. The
skull, according to his testimony, had
been crushed in above the temple, the
wound being in the shape of a crescent.
This was probably made with the ham
mer end of a hatchet. Besides this there
were three other wounds on the- head,
probably made with the sharp edge of a
hatchet. Each of these cut through -the
skull and penetrated the brain. On the
upper part of the body there were throe
hatchet* wounds. Any one of the seven
wounds was sufficient to have produced
death.
. Steven Korad, who was employed by
Briggan, testified that Briggan, Mattle
and himself- had breakfast together in
the kitchen of the Briggan house. There
appeared to be no enmity between Mattle
and Briggan at the time. Briggan fin
ished his breakfast first, got up from the
table and stationed himself behind the
chair of Mattle. Korad arose next and
left the kitchen. Mattle was still eating
and Briggan standing behind him. Korad
closed the kitchen door when he went
out and he' had taken about three steps
when he heard two groans coming from
one of the men in the kitchen. He then
went on to the milkhouse and attended
to some chores. Soon afterward, as Ko
rad was passing the kitchen, Briggan
came out with a hatchet covered with
blood in his hand. He took the hatchet
to the toolhouse opposite and then re
turned to the kitchen. Korad was not
more 'than ten or fifteen feet away from
him at the time. The hatchet in evi
dence was shown to the witness, who
identified it as the one he saw in Brig
gan's hand. . Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ .-/
Korad said that* he then became fright
ened, and, believing that possibly Brig
gan would kill him too, made for a mili
a quarter of a mile away. Henry Mc-
Arthur returned with him after some time
had elapsed, Korad desiring to get his
pay and his trunk. They found Briggan
at the house.
McArthur asked where Mattle was,
and was told that he had been "paid off
and fired," and when last seen was go
ing up the road. At this time the floor
of the kitchen was wet in places, hav
ing just been scrubbed. .
.Korad- asked Briggan for his wages,
but Briggan wanted him . to stay a few
days longer. â¢ This Korad refused ! to ! do.

Democrats may continue to denounce the Dingley
tariff as a breeder of trusts, but the people will take
notice that it has not bred panics, paralysis and hard
timci like the Wilson tariff
General Kitchener has left South Africa for Eng
land. As he left he was showered with new honors.
If he had won as many victories in war as he has
triumphs as a man of peace Napoleon wouldn't have
been a third-rater even in man's treacherous memory.
Local authorities are seriously disturbing their
brains in discussing what they conceive to be neces
sary amendments to the charter. It would be in the
nature of a charitable act to suggest to the gentle
men to desist and allow the courts to continue in
their work of annihilating our singular instrument of
municipal government.
Officers of the Federal Government stationed in
this city have reached the conclusion that iÂ£ will be
necessary to have two detention sheds instead of one
to house coolies for safe keeping at the Mail dock.
If this would mean twice as many escapes as have
been made from one shed it would be wise to revise
and reconsider the official opinion. \
Such a warning -against extravagance is so excel
lent it is. a pi^y its effect was spoiled almost imme
diately by the publication of treasury statistics. The
gold holdings now aggregate $554,000,000, and at
tention is called by Treasurer Roberts to the fact
that the outstanding gold certificates now exceed in
volume the amount of United States notes or green
backs. Of the goM stock $150,000,000 is reserved as
a protection for .United States notes, $347,000,000 is
Continuing his warning Mr. Cannon is reported to
have said: "If we authorize the Panama canal there
would have to be taken $4O,ooo,oo<| out of the present
surplus at once. If we. provide for a Pacific cable there
would be other large expenditures. Without regard
to those, and looking only at the present action of
Congress as it stands to-day, it will take every cent
of the money we receive during the coming fiscal
year to pay the expenses in sight for which we have
already made appropriations.'.'
In the course. of his speech Mr. Cannon pointed
out that appropriation bills passed or pending at this
session amount to $590,000,000, and the regular an
nual appropriations amount to upward of $70,000,000.
There are. other miscellaneous appropriations sure to
be made, which will swell the sum by $10,000,000 ad
ditional, so that the -total appropriations' provided
for will be not less than $670,000,000. Then, by way
of emphasizing the warning against such expendi
tures Mr. Cannon estimated that, leaving out the
sinking fund, the excess of appropriations at this ses
sion over the revenues for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1903, would be nearly $52,000,000.
. The timeliness of the warning and the eloquence of
the argument that sustained it are not to be ques
tioned, but unfortunately the facts do not agree. The
reports from the treasury show a large accumulation
of money in the vaults, the largest gold reserve
known to history and an undiminishing surplus.
SOME days ago Mr. Cannon,, chairman of the
House Committee on Appropriations, made, a
speech that attracted a good deal of attention
not only from the House but from the country. It
was a speech of warning against extravagance. The
orator denounced the prodigality with which Con
gressmen of both houses voted' appropriations and
predicted many calamities, including a deficit in the
treasury and an increased rate of taxation upon the
people.
A PULL TREASURY.
The Board of Health threatens to close the emer
gency hospitals unless the action of the Mayor in
cutting salaries be rescinded. The board has used
this same club so often that it would be a mercy for
some one to take it away and give another board a
chance with it.
While the trial proceeds the Governor will conceive
that he is what the Hoosier Congressman called "the
sinecure of all eyes," but he will plume and primp in
vain. He is merely an incident in the affair. Reve
lations of bad administration touched his political
confidants and he has jumped into the ring in their
defense and for their shelter, to prevent, if possible,
acy efficient investigation. Our purpose is to have
sach investigation as speedily as may be consistent
with its fullness and accuracy.
The Governor's scheme is to secure delay. His
plan can have no other effect. Proof of the corrup
tion and maladministration of the prison should be
promptly made and met. That is the matter of in
terest to the people. The personal affairs of the Gov
ernor of California, "alias Henry T. Gage," as that
expansive minded person would put it, are of but
little interest to them. Fool Governors are not a
scarce article. Older States than this have had them
snd survived Good and bad, Governors come
and Governors go, usually into obscurity, but
the State and its institutions we have al
ways with us. The prisons, unfortunately, will
and be administered and their cost be
paid by the people long after the present Gov
ernor of the State will be forgotten. So the focus
of popular interest is not upon the Governor's repu
tation. He affects to believe that it is fly-blown by
libel. The people are indifferent to its condition.
They want something that will be admonitory to
prison management, if the same have gone wrong.
Therefore they seek the way opened by The Call to
find out.
The peculiar dignity that doth hedge about the
Governor of California has inoculated his few news
paper organs, and that one that was born with one
hand, palm up, behind its back, and for the earliest
word its infant lips could trjuselected "backsheesh,"
is now dancing up and down screaming "delay" be
cause it is proposed to relocate the scene of trial by
placing it near where the testimony is, and where
proceedings may be prompt, the evidence full and
the conclusion can be quickly reached. It is no small
consideration that public economy will be at the
same time consulted. As the taxpayers have to pay
for the civet to sweeten the Governor's reputation
they ought t'o be consulted at the initial stage of the
proceeding.
WHEN the Govei^or of California decided
to apply -a judicial cosmetic to his official
complexion and brought criminal and civil
suits for libel he was at great pains to so prepare the
criminal branch of his quest for whitewash as to make
sure its prolongation past the time of the State con
vention. Now The Call has no such personal inter
est in that convention as to make its date determina-.
tive of any inquiry into the affairs of San Quentin.
We want a competent examination of the conduct of
that prison, under such authority as vill bring wit
nesses, bills, books and accounts into court.
NO DELAY.
Superintendent of Schools R. H. Webster says that
San Francisco has grown rapidly in a year. and the
progress, has' not ceased. \ this ought to be in the
nature of a suggestion to the Board of Education to
think back upon itself and improve its methods to
suit the times.
TRYING THE AMMUNITION.
HAVING tried in vain, all winter to develop out
of the legislation.-of the session- some sort of
an issue, on which to take an appeal to the
people this fall, the Democratic leaders in. Congress
are trying in, these closing days, to get into the Con
gressional Record as many stump speeches as they
can for general circulation: What they lack in the
way of issues they, purpose to' make, up in the- way of
declamation. The. consequence is that the last week
or two has been marked by- some very perfervid
rhetoric from the spellbinders of Hhe House, arid
those who, complained during. the winter that'the art
or oratory is dead are now grumbling because there
is so much of it. ' .' :
Under any circumstances there, would have been
more or less of campaign oratory in the House dur
ing the closing weeks of the session; for a campaign
is coming on and the opposition party must have
from its representatives in Congress, something in
the way .of documents for distribution. The absence
of any clear ground on which to make the fight,
however, renders the oratory this year more torrid
and tempestuous than ever. The old maxim, "When
you have no case abuse your opponent," applies well
to the Democratic situation just now. Never was
that party so absolutely without either an issue or a'
leader, and, naturally, enough, the advocates of the
party are doing their Dest to make Rome howl by
their denunciations of the administration.
'Recently the Democrats of the House, taking ad
vantage of the latitude permitted in the discussion of
the generar deficiency bill^ turned 'loose the.ir big
guns and tried out all the political ammunition they
expect to use this" fall.- The ' leader* :'of. the party,
Mr. Richardson of Tennessee, was particularly vivid
and eloquent in" his style of banging away at every
thing in .sight. He arraigned 'the. Republican party
and the administration' for nearly everything, of evil
now-above the horizon, from water cure in the Phil
ippines to the rise in the price of meat| and it is
probable we shall see his speech floating : ->.about
among the' campaign documents designed'' to*"ihduce
.unreflecting men to vote the Democratic ticket.
It is significant of the confidence of the Republi
can leaders in the intelligence of the voters that they
are making little or no effort at elaborate refutation
of the Democratic, attacks. In reply to Richardson
Mr. Cannon, speaking for the Republicans, con
tented himself with saying: "We are not perfect, and
we do not claim to be. We. pull the wagon and we
do the work, and you find the fault. We have been
at that now for over a generation, and still we have
pulled along. It does you good, and I do not think
it hurts us. You had full power under Cleveland.
You came into power partially from .time to time,
but then you had full power. It is recent â from 1893
to 1897. Don't you wish you could blot out the
recollection of the manner in which you exercised it?
And for gall and cheek, with the recent performance,
now, when we are doing the best we can, meeting
every obligation;- the country prosperous, passed
through the war with honor, passed through the war
with justice, solving the questions that grew out of
that war and solving them with courage, notwith
standing the criticism and opposition â gentlemen of
your party, still you scold."
No further refutation can be needed either for the
attack of .Richardson or' that of any other member
of the opposition. The Republican party is doing
the work while Democracy scolds. It will be easy
for the voters to decide on election day whether to
cast their ballots for the worker or the termagant.
THE CANAL.
R.RACTICAL. philanthropy was never
. better/illustrated than yesterday
when the* Salvation Army took un
... 4 der ,.care ( .no Â«- less ,_than
V * 530 poor mothers .and babies on a
trip to' El Campo.- For days members of
the army had been preparing for the out
ing which was to bring joy to so many.
It was to be a day of recreation among
the sylvan glades and by the waters* of
the bay â delights rarely known by those
for whom, the entertainment had been
planned.
Before 9 o'clock yesterday morning the
gathering of the excursionists commenced
and to each parent or guardian was given
a badge with an initial, the initial being
for subsequent convenience. . â¢
Mothers from every, quarter of the city
hurried along with their precious, though
in many cases pale and weakly charges.
There- was the American mother, side by
side with the Italian or the German
motherâ all with their little tots, receiving
that tender care and watchfulness which
is noticeable in the poor as well as the
rich mother. Chinese mothers brought
their little ones attired quaintly. Gen
eral good behavior was a characteristic
that was noticeable among the older chil
dren who had taken advantage of the hos
pitable invitation of the army, for
though it was announced that the excur
sion was to be for "babies" and "poor
mothers," there were many children of a
larger growth at the festivities held by
the seaside .under the ricn foliaged hills.
And how the children scampered up and
down the mountain side and splashed and
reveled in the cool, invigorating surf.

And how good had many of our citizens
been, for had they riot listened to the ap

hearts senu to the headquarters meats,

nuts, candles and fruits?
W. A. Desborough had charge of the

PERSONAL MENTION.
THE CALL was the first paper in the country
to announce the probable consideration by
Congress of the Panama route for an isthmian
canal. Our judgment was based on. circumstances
solely. .At that time the Panama franchise and
property had passed into, the hands of a new com
pany, which had renewed work on the project and
was making no offer. to sell. But the whole canal
policy of this country was being used for demagogy
and sensation. The Clayton-Bulwer treaty was an
embarrassment to the McKinley. administration, and
the fluid and unstable attitude of Â¦ Nicaragua and
Costa "Rica was unpromising. . j. . â^
If the Nicaragua canal proposition enjoyed a
monopoly of the possibilities Â¦ it presented every
chance for obstruction and delay that the opponents
of any canal could wish. President McKinley was
determined to have a canal begun as soon as possi
ble, and we saw clearly that there must be a choice
alternative to the Nicaragua route, and it could only
be the Panama. Therefore we announced with con
fidence that the short route would be considered and
probably adopted. This was long in advance of the
report of the canal commission. When that -.report
was made our judgment in the premises, was con
firmed and there remained in the way only the mat
ter of price and title. If these are. found satisfactory
the Panama route. will be acquired. "As the Panama
railroad goes with it, a great cheapening in construc
tion will result by having that facility for the transpor
tation of men and material required in the work. The v
shortness of the Panama route, its -distance ' -from
volcanic activity, its freedom from â¢ any treaty com
plications with Europe, and the fact that in its ac
quisition and construction we have one sovereignty
to deal with instead of two, seem to have been the
factors in influencing the Senate in selecting it.- Tlie
people will be satisfied since it means that .a], canal'
will be in use much sooner than if built on any other
route.

Why not let well enough alone? The Republicans
who have beaten the junta bill -stand squarely and
loyally on their party platform, which declares for
reciprocity in those things which we do not produce
at home. It may serve the purpose of some secret
enemies of the party to call these gentlemen "trait
ors," and that may be the form in which the Secre
tary of War wants to carry the issue into the cam
paign. They have heretofore been called I in
surrectos" and "insurgents," terms that originated in
the War Office. Heaping opprobrium upon men
who stand by the principles of their party is proper
and congenial work for a department of the Govern
ment which has caused every scandal that the pa r ty
has to pack.
Why should this questfon be selected as the burn
ing issue of the campaign, anyway? It carries with
it all the scandals for which the War Department is
responsible. It smells of that payment to persuade
Gomez to put a curb bit in the mouth of his patriot
ism in order to let Palma become President of Cuba
to present his country as a mendicant, needful of
alms from American farmers. It is directly tainted
.with the bribe passed through the hands of F.. B.
Thurber to secure this very legislation. It is discred
ited by the purely invented and artificial pretense that
we are under obligations to Cuba, that we- owe her
a moral debt, that we will be dishonored if we don't
give her planters all these millions. These things
are not true, and, not being true, cannot be estab
lished as facts by any appeal to the people. Cuba
owes us everything. We owe her nothing. She
owes us that very independence which enables her
to sit on our doorstep, hat in hand, soliciting alms.
But for our blood and our money, spent in her bp-
half, she would still be a Spanish colony, ruled by a"
Captain General, who would beat her with one hand
while he robbed her with the other. -..-.
It is probable that such a campaign will result in
effecting a junction, finally, between the spot free
traders and the un-spotted free-traders. It will be
just such a co-operation as was effected in 1896 by
the partial money Republicans and the inf
partial sound money Democrats, only this time the
joining of forces will be against the Republican party
instead of for it.
With the Democrats evidently getting in line for a
campaign for general free trade, how will the Repub
licans look running a campaign for free trade in
spots with a foreign junta to pick out the spots
for us?
The Senators and Representatives who have op
posed and defeated the junta bill have the sympathy
and support of strong Republican States, without
whose votes a 'Republican House cannot be elected
next November nor a Republican President in 1904.
What leader is going to take the responsibility of
going into those States to ask their people to re
pudiate the action of their members of Congress?.
Will the Secretary of War send his generals in uni^
form, or will he go himself, to try on the people
themselves the dragooning he has so offensively at
tempted upon their representatives? Will the manu
facturers go out amefng the farmers and convince
them of their duty to give up the only stake of
agriculture in protection in order that our surplus
manufacturers may find a market in* Cuba? Will
Senators' who rest their fame on caveats undertake to
persuade the farmers that what hurts as a bill be
comes a beneficial pleasure when it is called a treaty?
It should be unnecessary to inform the inventive
Senator^ who files a caveat on the treaty plan, that
the people object to the thing itself, to free trade
with Cuba, and not to the method adopted to secure
it. 'It is a strange misconception of the popular atti
tude to assume that the American farmer, who ob
jects to the junta bill, will accept, with appetite and
pleasure, its provisions when embodied in a treaty.
AN Oakland paper, announces, with evidence^ .of
satisfaction/ that the senior Senator from
California is the inventor of the plan for free
trade with Cuba by treaty instead of by direct tariff
legislation. It is at the same time made known at
Washington that the fight for a free trade treaty will
be carried into the campaign this year in order to
secure a public sentiment that will ratify such a treaty
when it is sent in next December.

Thus.it seems that. in predicting a deficit Mr. Can
non.made a mistake. Nevertheless, his speech was a
good one. The fact that we have a surplus is no
reason why we should burn it. . ...
Furthermore, the .revenues have not greatly dimin
ished, despite the repeal of. the war taxes.. The
treasury report for June 11 as summarized in the dis
patches says: "To-day the cash balau.ee stands at
$i99,i/8,S32. The surplus of receipts over expendi
tures is now $78,218,740 -for the current fiscal year, or
just about the same as at the end of the. last fiscal
period. Yet the receipts from internal reventWhave
been far l^ss during the current fiscal year than\ last
year, owing to the repeal of a part of the war taxes
in 1901. The. further repeal of war taxes, which will
take effect at the beginning of the next fiscal year,
July 1, is expected to reduce the income from inter
nal revenue by a large* amount, but the reduction will
not be as large as the amount of the present surplus."

GRAND ISLAND, Neb r... June 24.â The
Democratic State convention convened at
2 o'clock with over 1000 delegates in at
tendancei H. F. Travis of Plattsmouth
was temporary chairman. After effect
ing organization the convention listened
to a speech by William J. Bryan. Bryan
was received with liberal applause and
delivered a stirring address. He paid his
respects to the Tilden Club, which lie
said had "regaled itself with a collation
in the banquet hall and served a buffet
supper to the rank and file in the base
ment."
"I have but* one purpose," continued
Bryan, "and that is to help the Demo
crats of the nation to write into law the
principles of Thomas Jefferson and' An
drew Jackson." He concluded by asking
the Democrats of Nebraska to stand
squarely on the two previous platforms
and pledged his support to the ticket.
Constantine J. Smyth, ex-Attorney Gen
eral of the State, was nominated tor Gov
ernor, defeating Victor Vifquain. Smyth
was escorted to the platform and made
a short address In which he thanked the
delegates and asked the convention to
adopt a "thorough Democratic platform."
He said the flght was on the railroads
and other corporations of the State, and
said the Democrats must push to the
front as never before.
TOPEKA, Kans., June 24.â The People's

tion, F. C. Powell, Reno; Superintendent
of Public Insurance, D. J. Hart, Norton.
The convention was the scene of a live
ly contest al day in regard to the ques
tion of fusion with the Democrats. There
were a large number of straightout
Populists in the convention who -wanted
a ticket nominated without reference to
the wishes of the Democrats. While this
element was numerous enough to put up
a strong fight, it could not control the
policy of the convention. Fusion was ac
cordingly adopted.
Very turbulent scenes marked the pro
gress of the convention to-day. Senator
Harris, the temporary chairman, deliv
ered a keynote address this morning.
This session was peaceable, consisting
only in the appointment Â«of the usual
committees. In the afternoon the fusion
crowd, after securing the organization,
attempted to "railroad" the proceedings
in favor of amalgamation with the Dem
ocrats. Then the battle started. At
numerous periods during the afternoon
the 700 or more delegates appeared to all
be talking at once, so great was the con
fusion. The anti-fusionists were more
than determined to defeat the designs of
the other element.

HOLLENBECK ESTATE
WELL ADMINISTERED
SAN JOSE, June 24.â The Mercury says
regarding the settlement of the Hollen

- In the estate of Narcissa B. Hollenbeck,
the final account of Alexander Peers, as ex
ecutor, was settled yesterday, and the es
tate, consisting or $8581 93. in money, was dis
tributed to V.Kooh.as trustee, under the will
of Mrs. . Hollenbeck. The accounts settled re
lated only to transactions since the first of
January last. Mr. - Peers was appointed
executor In April, 1881. On the 4th of last
April an account was filed covering the ad
ministration of the estate from the 1st of Jan
uary, 1894, to the 1st of January, 1902. Soon
afterward the residuary legatees, by their at
torneys, W. A. Bowden and George F. Car^
1 oil, filed a petition charging Peers with the
fraudulent misapplication of - about jfGOOO,
claiming that the estate was appraised at
about |30,000 And had dwindled down to about
$9000. The facts, as shown by the records
of the probate, however, are, that the estate
was appraised at $22,867 66, of which $21,725
was for real estate heavily incumbered. Peers
sold the real estate for $26,431 93, out of which
he paid the lncumbrances. Â¦ > ,
The court, In settling his account, decided
that the estate had ; been honestly adminis
tered and with exceptional economy,' and that
the charges made against Peers were entirely
unfounded. His accounts were settled as ren
dered. ) Peers, however, being unwilling longer
to manage the estate, tendered his resignation
as trustee, and Koch was appointed to succeed
him. The estate was yesterday distributed
to Koch aa trustee, and the money paid ever
to him. ,' . -
FRANK MATTHAI'S THIAL
ENDS IN AN" ACQUITTAL
Napa County Jury Finds the Defend-
ant U"ot Guilty of Man
slaughter.
, NAPA, June 24.â Frank Matthai was ac
quitted by a jury here : to-night of the
charge of manslaughter. The trial had
been In progress seven days. The jury
was out for seven hours before agreeing
upon a. verdict.
This case has been in court here for
the past two years. Matthai was charged
with the killing of George Stanley, in
Chiles Valley, in 1900, after a quarrel over
some mining locations. In a former trial
he was found guilty of manslaughter, but
he appealed to the Supreine Court and
was granted a new trial.
LONDON, Jiwie 24. â Oxford University to

. BpSTON, June 24.â Suspected of the
death of seven persons, but indicted for
murdering only three, Miss Jane Toppan,
who was yesterday declared insane, has
confessed that she has killed during her
career as a professional nurse not less
than thirty human beings.
This statement was made to Judge Frfid
M. Bixby of Brockton, senior counsel at
the trial at Barnstable yesterday, when
Miss Toppan was found not guilty by rea
son of insanity of the charge of murder
ing Mrs. Mary D. Gibbs. Judge Bixby
said also that Miss Toppan had admitted
that she had set fires and committed other
serious acts. She said she could not help
committing the crimes. She argued,
moreover, that she was not insane.
The woman said she knew she was do
ing wrong when she administered poison
to her victims and she f.sked Judge Bix
by how, under such circumstances, she
could be of unsound mind. Morphine was
Miss Toppan' s agency for producing
death. Many of the victims were unsus
pecting and most intimate friends. Others
were the patients of reputable physicians,
who employed her on account of her abil
ity as a nurse. Miss Toppan was so ex
pert in her knowledge of drugs that she
was able to escai>e detection for year*.
She did not enumerate her many victims,
although she did admit the killing of
Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Henry Gordon of Chi
cago and Alden P. Davis, all of whom
died at Calumet last summer.
Miss Toppan was indicted last Septem
ber for these three murders, the State
electing to try her on the Gibbs count.
Miss Toppan was taken to the Tauntou
Insane Hospital to-day to begin her life
sentence. Â¦

Dr. Matson's Wife Says
HÂ« Is Cold-Hearted \
and Disdainful <
Dr. Andrew P. Matson and his wife,
who reside at 1769 Howard street, do not
possess the "affinity that promotes and
preserves domesticâ 'felicity." At least
that is the burden of Anna Marie Mat
sen's complaint In a divorce suit filed
yesterday. For five years, alleges â¢ Mrs.
Matson, she has suffered torture beyond
description because of her husband's
treatment. According to her complaint,
Matfeon looks upon a woman as a
chattel, unworthy of devotion or
care, and fit only to act as a drudge and
servant. Her every act, alleges the wife,
offended her husband, and he never miss
ed an opportunity to humiliate her in
the presence of others. She, did not eat,
to suit him, she alleges, neither did she
walk, talk nor sit in a manner to meet
with .his approval. "He even objected
to the way I held my dress," she alleges,
"and caused me to feel greatly ashamed
by accusing me of being filthy in my
habits. I possess a refined nature, and
suffered agonies by reason of his constant
fault finding."
The Matsons are both dentists. â¢ Mrs.
Matson does the work, it is alleged,
while her husband goes away on fishing
trips. Mrs. Matson further alleges that
she has' earned the house rent and the
gas bill, and has paid other . household
expenses through her efforts. She has
done everything, she alleges, to make
Matscr.'s life a happy one, but to no
avail. Her every effort Is treated with
disdain, and instead of praise, love and
affection she receives, she alleges, abuse
and invectives.
The couple have no children. They

"WASHINGTON, June 24.â Two notable
speeches marked the closing of the gen
eral debate on the Philippine civil gov
ernment bill to-day. They were made by
Landis, an Indiana Republican, and by
Williams, a Mississippi Democrat. There
were demonstrations after each conclud
ed. The other speakers to-day were Ball
of Texas, Jones of. Virginia, Shafroth of
Colorado and Crumpacker of Indiana. The
latter closed the general debate lor tue
bill with a strong speech.
Some routine business was transacted
in the House prior to the resumption of
the debate on the Philippine bill. Bills
v/ere passed to establish a subport of
entry at Naco, Ariz.; to appropriate $3000
annually for the support and maintenance
of the permanent international commis
sion of the Congress of Navigation; to
authorize the Director of the Census to
compile statistics regarding irrigation.
Ball Of Texas, the first speaker on the
Philippine civil government bill to-day,
made a sensational onslaught on the Re
publican policy and on the President.
Taking Pecksniff as his text, he charged
the President and administration with
hypocrisy.
Landis of Indiana made an earnest
speech in support of the policy of retain
ing the Philippine Islands. He engaged
in a sharp passage with Clark of Mis
souri. He described Clark, after war was
declared, as charging up and down the
aisle, boasting that the Democrats had
taken the Republican party by the scruff
of the neck and dragged it into war.
This drew from Clark a challenge to
Landis to place in his speech the names
of the eighty-five Republicans whom he
described as the "kickers" and who, he
said, went to President McKinley and
threatened to vote with the Democrats
to recognize the independence of Cuba un
less he sent the right kind of a message
to Congress. Â¦Â¦'' . ;"Â¦
"That is a fiction." cried Landis, while
Cooper of Wisconsin, who- said he was
a member of the committee that waited
upon President McKinley, denied that
any such conversation ever occurred. On
the contrary, he said, the committee told
the President that they were willing to
abide by the decision of the administra
tion.
Landis thereupon repeated his state
ment that Clark had boasted that the
Democrats had dragged the Republicans
into the war.
"That's what we did!" shouted Clark.
"And then wh,en the war came with
its problems, consequences and responsi
bilities," flashed back Landis, "you turned
your backs and ran away."
A tremendous burst of applause greeted
this reply. For fully a minute it con
tinued, until checked by the presiding of
ficer. Â¦ .
Landis paid a glowing tribute to the
bravery and heroism of General Funston.
In the midst of it, while lie was describ
ing Funston swimming a river during the
expedition which resulted in the capture
of Aguinaldo, Sulzer of New York raised
a general laugh by exclaiming, "Funston
can't swim." â¢ Â¦

DANDRUFF CAUSED BY A GERM.
A. New Discovery That Kills the
Germ and Prevents Baldness.
Pretty nearly all the hair preparations
for dandruff have some merit In allaying
Itching of the scalp and In being a fairly
good dressing for the hair, but there is
only one that recognizes what causes
dandruff, falling hair and baldness and
that destroys the cause, a little germ
and that', is Newbro's Herplclde. This
germ eats its way into the* scalp down to
the hair root, where it saps that vitality
causing dandruff as it digs up the scalp
into little white scales. Unless it is de-
stroyed there's no permanent stopping of
falling hair and cure of dandruff and
baldness. Newbro's Herplcide kills the
germ. "Destroy the cause, you remove
the effect." â¢

ago, but the other two, Luther and
Charles Rodgers, are still living. The
former is cashier of the Bank of Mon
terey at Salinas and the latter resides at
the ' old home in Watsonville. Rodgers'
father, James W. Rodgers, died a short
time ago at Watsonville at a ripe old age.

mourn his loss. Kane is said to.be doing
a hot foot in the direction of St. Louis,
his home, and claims to be signed by the
St. Louis National League Club. Kane
came out here last March and touted
himself as a vender. He proved more of
a goldbrick, however, and never showed
up to advantage untilthe last two weeks,
when his work began to improve a little.
He always was wild and unsteady and
never could be relied upon. He is a small
less and his place can' easily be filled by
Manager Harris.
ADOLPHUS G. RUSS. .one of the
oldest settlers, of San Francisco,
died yesterday at his home. 25
Columbia square. Death was not
unexpected, as his health had
been very poor for the last year. The di
rect cause of death was pleuro pneu
monia.
Deceased leaves five children, three boys
and two girls. He was the' possessor of
a large estate, of which the Russ House,
on Montgomery. street, is a part.
Adolphus G. Russ was born in Germany,
January 19, 1826, and was the eldest son
of Christian Russ, a pioneer, who died in
San Francisco in 1857. Acolphus came to
America with his father and two brothers,
Charles and Augustus, in 1835 and settled
in New York City, where he received his
education and training. In 1846 he and
his father and brothers joined the regi
ment organized by Colonel J. D. Steven-
English schooner yacht Cicely, owned by
Cecil . Quentin, designed to challenge
Emperor William's American built
schooner yacht Meteor. The Cicely was
the first yacht in the race to reach Heligo

son, with whom they were acquainted, to
come to California. On September 26,
1846, they left New York in the famous old
ship Loo Choo, arriving in San Francisco
Bay March 26, . 1847. On their coming
ashore they proceeded to the Alcalde's of
fice and bought and paid for three lots,
of fifty varas each, in the sand hills, pay
ing a price of $16 or $17. â¢ At this time
there were not over thirty houses in the
town, and none of them south of Pine
street. Upon the land purchased-by Mr.
Russ now/ stands the famous Russ House.
Mr. Russ also made several ventures in
mining, but was not very successful. In
1851 he was married to Miss Frances Si
mons. They had ten children, five of
whom are deceased. i
In 1868 Mr. Russ was elected to the State
Legislature and served one. term. For
ten years he was a director of the Ger
man Benevolent Society, being president
of the society twice.
Mr. Russ was a Democrat in politics. He
was also an honored member of the Pio
neer Society, and was one of the first or
ganizers of the San Francisco fire depart
ment in 1850, and belonged to the Empire
Company, of which David C. Broderick
was foreman. In 1864 and '65 he was captain
of â¢ the ' State militia. Columbia square
was given to the city by Mr. Russ to be
made a public park. Russ street was
named after him. He was also the presi
dent and founder of the German Hospital.
Mr. Russ' brother, Henry, who is taking
' a vacation at Aetna Springs, has been
notified of the death and will arrive in
the city to-day. ,
GIVES HIS LIFE
FOR A PET DOG
ARTHUR RODGERS. one of the
most prominent and successful
lawyers of the State, died at Au
burn, Placer County, yesterday
afternoon, after a long illness.
Tuberculosis was the direct cause of
death, although Rodgers had long been a
patient sufferer from other ailments. His
death was expected for some time and
the members of his family were with him
when the final summons came.
Arthur Rodgers was born in Tennessee
in 184S. and when but a boy moved with
his parents to California and settled at
Watsonville. He attended the public
Â«chool there and after finishing his pre
liminary education turnec pedagogue, be
fore taking up the higher branches of
study. He subsequently entered the Uni
versity of California and was graduated
with high honors in 1872. After finishing
the course at Berkeley he pursued the
study of law in the offices of Wright &
Nourse. His natural adaptability and
close attention to study soon brought him
his reward and he was admitted to the
bar in 1S75.
His success as a lawyer was remarkable
from the start. He opened offices for him
self at first, and his ability was soon rec
ognized. In 1886 he became associated
with Cameron H. King, who was at that
time one of the foremost lawyers of the
State. He was associated with King un
til 1S94, when the firm dissolved partner
ship and Rodgers became a partner in the
law firm of Rodgers, Patterson & Slack.
The new firm soon built up one of the
most extensive practices in the State.
Rodgers in political belief was a stanch
Democrat and frequently took a promi
nent part in the conventions of his party.
It was Rodgers who nominated former
Mayor E. B. Pond for Governor at the
convention held at San Jose some twelve
years ago, but Pond was defeated.
Rodgers always took a deep interest in
the affairs of the State University, and in
1Â£S2 he was appointed a Regent by Gov
ernor Stoneman. He held the position for
several years and did much for the im-

RACES IN THE EAST.
Young Harrison and some of the heirs
claim that the decedent left a will In
which he made ample provision for the
putative son, but if such is the case it
has never come to light. The property
consists of a large area of farming land,
capital stock of the Bank of Orland and
other corporations and money on deposit.
The estate has been involved in a great
deal qf litigation since Nelson's death,
which' occurred in May; 1900, some of the
suits btlng decided in favor of the estate
and some adversely. Several suits are
still in the courts. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Harrison are still living. .
Walter Harrison's action is brought
under the provisions of section 1661 of tho
Code of Civil Procedure, to establish his
right as sole heir of the estate. The ap
plication is resisted by the 'half brothers
and sister of the deceased.
Young Harrison has compromised with
three of the heirs.
NO WTLI. EVER FOUND.
H. W. C. Nelson was one of tbe early
settlers in this section of the State. He
was the owner of a large farm near Or
land and valuable personal property. In
1874 J. M. Harrison, with his wife and
two children, came to the State and went
to live on the Nelson ranch, Harrison
acting as hired man and his wife doing
the cooking. Harrison devoted his whole
attention to the farm work, giving little
care to dress or personal appearance.
Mrs. Harrison was young and attractive
of form and feature. Nelson was never
married, but was very susceptible to the
charms of the. other sex. He and Mrs.
Harrison were very friendly or, as Har
rison expressed it, they were "like broth
er and sister." The gossip of the neigh
borhood connected the name of Nelson
and Mrs. Harrison frequently.
In 1878 Mrs. Harrison - gave birth t6 a
son, Walter Harrison, the present claim
ant to the Nelson estate. Nelson support
ed the child and treated him as a son,
and finally, in 1895,-it is alleged, acknowl
edged in writing that the boy was his
son. The Harrison family left Nelson's
ranch prior to his death and Nelson took
the boy to live with him. the lad remain
ing on the ranch until Nelson's death.
LIKING FOR HIS COOK.
WILLOWS, June 24.â Fraught with sen
sational features is the suit commenced
to-day before a jury in the Superior
Court of Glenn County, which will decide
whether Walter Harrison is the son of
the late H. W. C. Nelson and entitled to
an estate valued at $125,000. The case is
'unique in that one of the strong points
in favor of the claimantâ one which is
; expected to have great weight with the
juryâ is his remarkable resemblance to
the late capitalist whose son lie claims to
be. This resemblance is even admitted
by heirs of' Nelson who are resisting
Harrison's contention. Neighbors of the
decedent say that the putative sor. is the
"picture" of his alleged progenitor anÂ«l
that he has all of the characteristics of
the latter. Another interesting feature
of the case is that certain of ihe heirs
regard his claim as just, have taken sides
with him and have given him powers' of
attorney and even deeds. So much bit
terness has been engendered that the le
gal fight will be stubbornly contested and
may drag along for some days.
Ex-Judge Bridgeford of San Francisco,
William Finch and R. S. Clifton are rep
resenting young Harrison and Donohue
and Freeman are counsel for the oppos
ing heirs. ..

This bout was a poor exhibition. Al
though it is said Erne had taken matters
lighthly during His training, he had no
difficulty in disposing of Maloney, who
on several occasions fell without bein^
struck and had to be severely cautioned
bv the referee. Erne did practically au
the scoring and knocked out his opponent
with a left on the jaw.
The attendance at the club was again

Tommy Ryan of Kansas City defeated
Johnny Gorman of New York in the third
round. These two fighters were in fine
shape. Gorman was seven pounds heav
ier than Ryan. The latter showed greater
steadiness and speed than his opponent
and allowed Gorman to do all the rush
ing. Gorman landed several stiff jab3,
but in the third round Ryan displayed
marked superiority and landed with his
left and- right simultaneously on Gorman's
head. Gorman -was dazed and before he
could recover he received a swinging right
on the jugular and was counted out.

Board of Supervisors. to r morrow.
Ex-Supervisor Charles Wesley Reed
addressed Division No. 205 of the Amal
gamated Association of Street Railroad
Employes of America at their meeting
last night at the Turk-street Temple.
Mr. Reed was introduced by Richard
Cornelius and spoke on "Municipal Owner
ship and Public Utilities," particularly
touching on the Geary-street road.
Mr. Reed said it was of vital moment
that the. municipal road should extend to
the ferries and to the ocean and that a
cross-town line, running from the Pre
sidio, on Chestnut street to Pierce and
thence to Vallejo to Franklin,
across Market to Eleventh and thence to
the Potrero, should be Included, and. It
was therefore necessary to bring-pres
sure-on the Supervisors to include the ex
tension of the proposed Geary -street roatf.
In case, they refused to do t*iis there still
remained a right of petition under the
charter, which would compel the Super
visors to submit the requirements" of the
proposed road to the people for decision.
Another important point that Mr. Reed
made manifest was, tiiat the present
street railroad corporations have-applled
for franchises for street railways on near
ly all the unoccupied streets In the north
ern part of the city. â¢ *Â¦- ..

SUES DAVIS-STREET FIRM
FOR A BREACH OF IiEASS
Suit was commenced' in the Superior
Court yesterday against Wheaton, Pond
& Harrold by J. A. Folger to recover
$1320 damages for alleged breach of cove
nants of lease. . . /
The defendants are the lessees of Ellen
Folder and rented the property on the
east side of Davis street, between Cali
fornia and Sacramento streets, for a pe
riod of ten years, from March 28, 1896, at
a monthly rental of $460. This lease was
subsequently assigned by C. E*. Whitney
& Co. to Wheaton, Pond & Harrold, who
undertook and agreed to perform all of
its obligations.
It was stipulated in the lease that
Wheaton. Pond & Harrold were to make
all necessary repairs to the premises dur
ing the period of the lease. In January
last certain repairs were necessary and
Wheaton, Pond~& Harrold, it is alleged,
would neither perform their obligation by
having them done nor pay for them. Mrs.
Polger alleges Folge'r had the work done
and settled the bill as well. She claims
that the defendants, Wheaton, Pond &
Harrold, repudiated their obligation and
declined to abide by their written con
tract. The amount of the claim has been
assigned to J. A. Folger, who has com
menced the action. Folger is represented
by Stratton & Kaufman.

JN THE SAN JOSE CONTESTS
Schoeffel had quite a pile of baggago
and the Inspectors went through every
package of it.
The lieutenant, Â¦with five enlisted men
t>* help him, rendered the inspectors
every assistance, and long before tho
heavy '.task was completed had so won
the Government searchers that they al
most regretted having found the jades.
A. Hesse of the Hospital Corps had
two jade tablets in his possession. He
had bought them, he said, from a Rus
sian soldier.
These tablets, with the Schoeffel collec
tion, were taken in charge by" ' Deputy
Surveyor Chauncey M. St. John and they
will be held pending instructions from
Washington. It is supposed that the seals
and tablets form part of the Imperial
records, and If such prove to be the case
back they will go to China.
The customs Inspectors are also look-
Ing for a gold Bible said to have been
taken from the sacred city, and supposed
to be on its way to America. The exist
ence of such a treasure is doubted by
many, but when Schoeftel's' baggage
pioved so rich in relics, and the fact was
reported to St. John, he gave orders to
search Schoeffel's baggage till the gold
Bible showed up.
Schoeffel Is popular among his .brother
officers. He was in many engagements
and on three different occasions bullets
passed through his clothing. His brother,
Captain Schoeffel, also of the Ninth, was
wounded in Samar and passed through
here some time ago on sick leave. '
Both sergeants were asked very much
the same questions as their predecessors,
namely, whether they knew of any cor
ruption on the police force, and both in
their turn replied that they neither knew
nor had ever heard of any such practices.
The Grand Jury received a letter yes
terday from the Examiner in which it
stated that the paper was not yet ready
to . proceed with the charges.
The inquisitorial body adjourned shortly
after 4 o'clock and will meet for further
consideration of the charges on Tuesday,
July 1.
At the close of Chief Wittman's exam
ination all the captains and sergeants
were excused, with the exception of Ser
geants Conboy and Shaw. Conboy has
been for months in charge of the China
town equad and Shaw recently succeeded
him.
Chief Wittman stated that the Grand
Jury had spoken with him on general
matters. He was asked if he knew of any
corruption on the police force. The Chief
replied. "Certainly not, nothing of the
kind; if there had been I would have re
ported it." Chief Wittman asked, "Why
don't they bring up these people who
have made these charges? We are here."
Mr. tNewhall said that if bribes had been
accepted by any member of the Police
Department, he would help the Grand
Jury all he could to punish the offenders,
but that so far no such reports had
reached his ears.
Commissioner Newhall was called first
and was with the Grand Jury for only a
few minutes. He was followed by Com
missioner Howell. and he in his turn by
Chief Wittman. The main question asked
each of these was whether they knew of
any corrupt practices In the Police. De
partment, and in each case the answer
was in the negative.
Subpenas had been issued for Commis
sioners Newhall and Howell, Chief Witt
man, Captains Dunleavy, Spillane and
Birdsall and Sergeants O'Connor, Burnett.
Shaw, Conboy and Donovan, and at 2
o'clock all were present. . *
The Grand Jury went into session yes
terday afternoon to consider the charges

rupt practices on the police force.

WHEN the Â¦ customs - inspectors
searched the, baggage brought
home on the Hancock by the
Ninth Infantry, they found
evidences of that regiment's
visit to China. When the baggage of Com
pany M was gone through it was seen
that the famous Ninth had been "Johnny
on the spot" In the sacred city, and .ha-i
brought away as souvenirs famous relics
for which the* Chinese Government has*
been searching ever since peace was re- .
stored. To First Lieutenant J. P: Schoef- .
fel of Company M belongs the credit of
bringing to America the finest collection
of Jade, that ever left China. This was
discovered by Custom-house men yester
day.
When the customs inspectors found it
they said "loot."' When- Schoeffel saw it
he said: "Yes, it's mine. How'd ye find .
It. Cost me $50. Loot? Not on your life.
Got it from a Chino, who told me that if
he. was known as a party to the sale, off ,
would go his head. Had to save the fel
low's head, so kept quiet about, it."
TABLETS AND SEALS.
Schoeffel's contraband consists of ten
jade tablets covered with Inscriptions
said Â»o be full of meaning to the patriotic
Chinese and forming part, it is also said,
of the records of the Emperor's ances
tors, and five seals. Each seal weighs
about five pounds and Hs surmounted by
an elaborately caryed animal form that
may represent dragon life in tha Orient.
The fact that Schoeffel had this collec
tion of jades in his possession was known
to a number of men in the regiment and
somebody whispered to the custom-house
i Inspectors. Schoeffel's baggage was care
fully searched, but nothing was tound. It
was searched again and yielded nothing
but a few cigars. Inspector Victor J.
Lindquist, -who had heard the whisper,
made a third search and found the jades.
They were stowed away with the prop
erty of Compny M. They were at. the
very bottom df a deep, narrow box, care
fully wrapped in the folds of an army
! tent. Lieutenant Schoeffel at once ac
' knowledged the ownership and, to save
the Inspectors further trouble, he said,
shewed them where he had packed the
remainder of the jades.
Fred Brown, an Oakland Student,
Drops Off Perry-Boat and Keeps
Afloat Until Rescued.
OAKLAND, June 24.â After being hit by
the paddle wheel of a ferry-boat and hav
ing his leg almost broken, Fred Brown,
the second son of Albert Brown, the
undertaker, made half an hour's fight for
life In the waters of San Francisco Bay
this morning and was rescued just as ha
was sinking. The boy, who la but IS
years of age, lost his balance In an effort
to catch his hat, which had been blown
from his head, and fell into ther water
from the forward lower deck of the ferry
steamer Bay City.
Mr. and Mrs. Brown and their two
sons, Albert J. and Fred, went to San
Francisco this morning on the 9:13 trip'
on the narrow gauge route. Fred and
his father remained on the lower deck
and went forward with a friend by the
name of Pomroy, while Mrs. Brown and
the elder son went upstairs into the ladies'
cabin. Fred seated himself on the chain
box near the railing, while Mr. Brown
and Mr. Pomroy leaned on the box. chat
ting. Suddenly a gust of wind caught the
boy's hat and in clutching for it he went
overboard.
The alarm was given at once and Cap
tain Leale stopped the boat and ordered
a small boat lowered.
Young Brown was swept astern^iy %
swift tide. Some on the boat thought
that he had been carried into the wheel
and had met Instant- death, but a mo
ment later he was seen manfully swim
ming.
The boat from the ferry steamer picked
him up. It was found that he had mado
his long, hard swim with his leg ail but
broken where he had been struck by one
of the blades of the paddle. He was taken
to the Harbor Emergency Hospital In San
Francisco and treated and this evening
was brought to his home in this city.
"The boy lost his hat and. in trying to
save It fell overboard," said Mr. Brown.
"If he bad not been a strong swimmer
he could not have been saved, but the
wonder is that he could swim after the
injury he received from the wheel."

fore Judge Melvin on a writ of habeas
corpus. She is weak mentally, and Mrs.
Eliza Swift of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children found it
necessary to get the custody of the chil
dren a while ago.
When Judge Melvin 'ordered the chil
dren into Mrs. Swift's custody and th<s
6fncers went to take them away tha
mother clasped them tightly to her bos
em and screamed. The officers took tha
children from her by force and held her
in a chair until they were taken to a
buggy that conveyed them, to a Frultvale
family that has agreed to give them a
heme.
Screaming at the top of her voice and
clinging frantically to her two youn*
children, Mrs. Edith Dixon was the cen
ter of a pitying group of spectators this
n'ornlng in Judge Melvin's court. Tha
children, one 7 years old and tha other
14 months, did not want to leave their
mother, and their pleas for "mamma"
rent every heart.

1118 Broadway. June 24.
The convention will resume Its sessions
to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock. Among
the speakers will be Edward F. Adams.
OAKLAND, June 24.â The thjrd annual
convention of the Pacific. Coast Co-opera
tive Union was opened this morning at
Hamilton Hall, Thirteenth and Clay
streets, President D. T. Fowler of the
University of California in the chair.
Delegates from various sections of the
State were in attendance. W. R. Johnson
was elected secretary! President '.- Fowler
appointed the following committees:
Credentialsâ C. Y. Roop, W. J. Thompson,
H. H. Miner; resolutionsâ W. J. Thomp
son, C. S. Harvey, Judge B. G. Hurlburt.
During his opening address on the rec
ords of grdwth of co-operation in Califor
nia, President Fowler said j there were
now in operation, : as one result: of. the
movement, more than fifty Rochdale co
operative stores, all , strong, and flourish-
Ing. Efforts to organize the fruit growers
and grain growers on a co-operative basis
were flourishing. A monthly journal
had been started with a large circulation.
During the afternoon, George W. r Pierce,
president of the Grain Growers' Associa
tion, A. H. Naf tzger, president ' of the
Southern California . Fruit Exchange;
Judge B. G. Hurlburt of the Cured Fruit
Association, and Vice President Sprague
of the Fresh Fruit Association, gave ad
dresses on the 'methods of- these organ
izations. A letter was read from J. N.
Woods, president of the Raisin' Growers'
Association, along similar lines. Â¦ .' â¢
, A. Hallner, vice president of the Roch
dale Wholesale Company, presented the
plan of that organization, saying that
the establishment of units' of effort in
localities with central organization was
productive of successful results. It was
argued that' the Southern California
Fruit Exchange, organized along those
lines, had met a greater measure of suc
cess than had the grain growers or the
cured : fruit association, which had only
a central body, with no local units or
exchanges. ' :
At the evening session "Co-operation
in the Animal World" was the subject of
an address by the Rev. Benjamin Fay
Mills. He drew from insect, bird and
mammal life to show that the co-opera
tive spirit is Instinctive In the lower
forms, and cited the habits of ants, bees,
teavers and cattle. .
"Ethics of Co-operation" was the sub
ject of the Rev. Ernest E. Baker's dis
course. The clergyman declared his
purpose was to put himself on record a*
being in belief and full sympathy witn
the principles of co-operation. He said,
further: I
Wherever you find a man llviny upon
another man, he is a barbarian. He may dress,
in good clothes, may pose as a churchman- and
a Christian man, but if his doctrine is "live
upon others" he Is a barbarian. I don't care
i( he be a Standard Oil man or a trust man
or what not.
"Live whether others live or not" â that is
the competitive principle enunciated in our
social life to-day. Competition is war, and
General Sherman was right when he said,
! "War ia hell."-
Co-operation is the law of love. It is the
doctrine of "Live that others may live." |

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON; June 24.â The belief
that a crisis approaches in Venezuela was
given fresh impetus to-day by the receipt
of a cablegram from United States Min
ister Bowen. The text of the dispatch
was not made public, but the message Is
said to show that a climax has come In
the . revolutionary movement against
President Castro.
Preparations to meet any emergency
have been made by the Navy Depart
ment. The warships Cincinnati and To
peka are now at La Guaira, while the
gunboat Cincinnati is on the way to San
Juan, Porto Rica.' The department's in
tention is to have the Marietta proceed
thence' to Colon and relieve the Machias,
but she will lie at San Juan until it is
apparent her services will not be needed
to reinforce the Cincinnati and the To
peka in protecting American lives and
property in Venezuela.
No report has yet come from the com
manders of the two warships at La
Guaira. The officers are to use their own
discretion in their course of action in
Venezuelan waters, and It is thought the
lack of a report means only the absence
of any important change In the situation
as far as they can view it.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Divorces were granted yesterday to Or
rin Eastland from Emma J. Eastland for
desertion. Anna T. AÂ».en from E. R. Allen
for desertion. Tillie M. Littick from
George Littick for cruelty.
Frank D. Cooney filed a suit yesterday
for the annulment of his marriage to
Jennie Cooney. The marriage took place
last November.
Annie Graham is suing Irvine Graham
for divorce for failure to provide and in
temperance. She alleges that for the last
five years she has had to depend upon
her own exertions to support herself and
daughter, aged 16 years. The Grahams
were married in February, 1S75.
Frank P. Carmichael, purchasing agent
of the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners, who is being sued for $50,000 dam
ages for the alle'ged alienation of aifec
tlons of the wife of F. W. Derrick, filed
an answer yesterday. He denies the truth
of Derrick's charges,, claiming that his
relations with Mrs. Derrick were of the
Platonic order, and alleges that any at
tention he paid her was not of a nature
to cause Derrick any uneasiness or dam
age. He says that he never kissed Mrs.
Derrick, or made love to her, or made
any sort of plans to win her love.
Charles A. Calhoun, foreman Oi. a shirt
factory at 230 Sutter street, was adjudged
guilty of contempt of court by Judge
Seawell yesterday for failing to pay his
former wife. Bertha A. Calhoun, $15 a
month alimony under a court order made
nearly three years ago. Mrs. Calhoun
stated that she has not received more
than $150 from Calhoun since they were
divorced. Calhoun was a candidate for
the office of Supervisor on the Union La
bor party ticket at the last election. He
will remain in confinement until he
makes suitable provision for Mrs. Cal
iioun. *
She rharges Ohlsen with' being drunk
for seven years and of" treating her cruel
ly during all that time. She alleges that
he threatened to kill her and frequently
beat her. Ohlsen, she alleges further,
caused her great misery by saying to
her: "You were married twice before you
married me. You killed both your hus
bands, but you cannot kill me. I'm too
tough." Â«
The Ohlsens reside at 3460 Twenty-fifth
street.
Mrs. Ohlsen among other things denies
that she stole $200 from her 'husband's
trousers while he was sleeping. On the
other hand, she alleges that he presented
her with the money. She never broke
his nose, she alleges, nor did she throw
decayed vegetables at him. Slje alleges
that the only time she threw cold water
upon him. was when it was necessary in
order to save her from his abuse.
Catherine Ohlisen, aged 75 years, has
determined that her husband, Ludwig
Ohlsen, who is thirty years her junior,
shall not be released from marital bond
age without undergoing a little catechiz
ing in the divorce court. She accoruingiy
filed an answer and cross-complaint yes
terday to the complaint for divorce filed
by Ohlsen some weeks ago. The answer,
which is quite voluminous, contains a
complete denial of the charges made by
the husband. The cross-complaint at
tributes to her husband many acts not
conducive to matrimonial harmony.
Immediately after the Stockton demon
stration in honor of Mayor Schmitz the
machine manipulators in San Francl3co
gave orders that factional leaders in the
boss camp should sink their quarrels and
effect a concentration of the push ele
ments in every district of the city. It is
claimed by the bosses that Burns. Her
rin, -Crimmins and Kelly will be doing
politics together before August 12, but
there is a deal of kicking in the Repub
lican County Committee over the appre
hension that the "organization" will be
compelled to play second fiddle to the Re
publican Mutual Alliance and take orders
in every district from Martin Kelly. It
ts clear to the level headed politicians
that the old boss of the Twenty-eighth
is in the saddle at the head of the push,
and will not allow any aspiring leauer
of the boss brigade to question his right I
of leadership. Danger that the Mayor
may win the entire San Francisco dele
gation to the Republican State conven
tion is the only known reason for the '
alarm in the boss camp.
GAGE CLUBS ABANDONED.
The County Committee's original pur
pose, to establish Gage clubs in the sev
eral Assembly districts has been aban
doned as a losing proposition. The push
leaders find it utterly impossible to re
awaken any enthusiasm for Gage. The
merchants, workingmen, business men
and taxpayers generally have had enough
of Gage, Kevane and Aguirre. Gage's ;
unpopularity in the country is well
known. He seems to be equally unpop
ular in the city. Recently vigorous ef
forts have been put forward to infuse :
some life into the campaign for Gage
in Napa, San Joaquin. Santa Clara and
Sacramento counties, but the politicians
who were charged with the duty of "in
fusion " have reported to machine head
quarters that Gage is politically a "dead
duck." It is said that United States
Marshal Shine, who has been secretly
working in Gage's interest, is utterly dis
couraged and feels like respecting ftie or
der of President Roosevelt that Federal
office holders shall not interfere in State
conventions. At Sacramento, in the mem
orable Senatorial campaign. Marshal
Shine at one time or another favored the
cause of every Senatorial aspirant ex
cept that of the winner.

REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE.
At a meeting of the Republican Mutual
AUiar.ce held last evening at its heaS
ouarttrs it was resolved that the allianco
"hold up to the view of its fellow citizens
the political standing of those who issue a
call for a movement free from the control
of corporate interest and corporate boss
control." The alliance urges that "it ia
part of the history of California that the
Republican party of San Francisco has
been dominated by two corporate hiie
lings. one a Democrat, the other not liv
ing in tne city, who have been feeding
from the public treasury," and it "warns

ticians.*' *\'*Â± Â¦'Â¦'.'.:

Mayor Schmitz yesterday signed the
municipal budget as adopted over his veto
by the Board of Supervisors. In signing
the budget the Mayor by no means mani
fested his approval of the various items
contained therein. Under the charter the
budget must be transmitted to the Audi

favorable criticism for having voted
against their chief. - .:

The committee also recommended the

ment to the charter increasing the salary
of the Assessor from J4000 to $8000 per
year.
Commissioner Casey said that if the
Board of Works were to do the sweeping
it would eventually lead to the establish
ment of municipal stables, which would
inure to the benefit of the city.
The Supervisors' Committee on Charter
Amendments recommended an amendment
yesterday providing that the Board of
Public Works shall cause the public
streets to be properly cleaned and
sprinkled and for that purpose shall em
ploy such laborers and other employes
as may be necessary. The Works Board
also may, with the consent of the Super
visors expressed by ordinance, purchase
machines, materials and such other ap
pliances as may be deemed necessary for
the work. The board, however, must give
the preference to hand sweeping so far as
it can do so. with reference to the proper
cleaning cf the streets and the fund at its
disposal. Commissioner Casey stated that
the plan is advisable, as he thought the
streets could be swept better than at
present because the Board of Works;
would be held responsible. When it was
stated that the city would be obliged to
pay $2 50 per day to street sweepers,
where $2 was being paid row by the con
tractors, Supervisor d'Ancona stated that

could go into the wages of the men.

A MATTER OF LEGAL FORM
In 1801. Major C. E. Dutton, United States
army, a seismic expert of repute, was sent to
the Nicaragua and Panama isthmuses by our
Government to examine and report upon this
branch of the canal question. His official re
port indicates that if there be any danger from
seismic^ disturbance it is equally applicable to
any canal route betwen the Atlantic and Pa
cific oceans. It is. In his mature opinion, a re
mote, contingency" deserving no " consideration,
except honest and reliable construction. So far
as records have been secured for some time
under United States official supervision, the
Panama route for a period of years has experi
enced twenty-eight seismic disturbances against
eighteen-at Nicaragua for the same period, so
that if the argument be applicable it decidedly
favors the Nicaragua route. It is also a fact
that the late seismic disturbances have not
been felt in Southern Nicaragua, on the Nicara
gua canal route, or in Costa Rica, while severe
shocks are reported upon the Panama isthmus.
Mexico. Guatemala, Salvador and Northern
Nicaragua have experienced the recent earth
quakes. On the Pacific Coast Guatemala alone
has suffered severely. At the Panama Isthmus
the north coa3t of South America and the
Southern West Indies, disturbances including
volcanic action at the latter, have been, pro
nounced, apparently culminating at Martin
inque and St. Vincent, i While no fair expert
considers the earthquake argument of- value in
connection with the canal, the proponents of
the Panama route have been confounded in
their recent assertion by the exemption of the
Nicaragua canal route from such disturbances,
while they cannot honestly claim the advantage
which this fact may be worth for the route
which they are desperately endeavoring to un
load upon our people. . â¢
Permit me to acknowledge your favor of May
20, inclosing an article from a California Jour
nal inclining to favor the Panama canal route
owing to the claim that It Is exempt from
earthquakes, i This does not surprise me, as
the proponents of that canal route have : pre
sented the argument through the public press
of the United States for want of anything more
truthful. . ' . Â¦ j
In response to a request made by Sec
retary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce for Information in regard . to the
frequency of earthquakes in. Panama and
in Nicaragua Captain W. L. ! Merry, the
United States representative at San Jose,

There is no law of Congress makingr it an of

The following is the text of Judge de
Haven's decision:
The decision in the Blasingame case
was handed down two years ago, and
shortly after that decision United States
Attorney General Griggsi wrote an elab
orate opinion to show that Judge Well

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, June 24.-The official an
nouncement, of the serious illness of the King
of England and the decision to postpone the
coronation indefinitely was an Inevitable shock
to the securities market of the world. The
New York market, however, met the shock
with great equanimity and the vigorous sup
porting orders placed In the market - by the
speculative parties which have constituted
themselves the guardians of the market soon
chocked the downward swing of prices with
which the trading began. London was quite
an active seller at the level maintained here,
but this Felling was well absorbed and pretty
general recoveries occurred within the first
hour of trading. With the unfavorable effect
of the English news thus apparently over
come, the subsequent evidences of weak
ness might be due to independent causes
Undoubtedly the considerable liquidation
In Amalgamated Copper- and Colorado Fuel
1 had an unsettling effect on the whole list
This selling, clearly was due to causes quite
Independent of the life or death of the Kin"
of England. Maneuvers by a professional bear

the bank rate early in July. On the news that
a successful operation had been performed on
the King consols rallied td 96, but closed at
95 13-16 and all markets were near the worst.
There were gloomy rumors that the King was
sinking; some were to the effect that his Majes
ty was dead.
The bank holidays on Thursday and Friday
hold good for commercial reasons. The Stock
Exchange committee will meet to-morrow to
decide whether or. not the exchange shall be
open on Saturday. There is a general feeling
that the postponement of the coronation cere
monies, for say three months, will spoil busi
ness conditions for all summer.
The American department was idle at first
and weakened on the King's illness, but New
York supported prices briskly, especially Wa
bash, Canadian Pacific and Chicago Great
Western. The professional element supported
United States Steel, but in the street prices
relapsed to the worst.

Chicago Grain. and Produce.
CHICAGO, June 24. â Manipulative fears
spread into wheat early in the day. A fairly
favorable weather map, email business and
lower prices in Liverpool because of the King's
illness and some small selling weakened wheat
a trifle -at the opening. It was only a short
time, however, until the talk of boosting July
options by a leading elevator started tin upward
! turn. Prices rallied fairly on the argument of
I depleted stocks and slow moving new wheat.
! Corn turned firm and "after early reports of
I harmless showers more rains were predicted.
(-Bradstreet's gave the â¢â¢World'-a visible decrease
I as 4,500,000 bushels the past' week. The out
1 siders became uneasy over the unsettled nature
[ 6f the pit and lought shy of July stuff. After
I a small up-turn prices dipped again and fluctu-
I ated narrowly but in an unstable manner.
j There was almost no short interest in the
Â¦ wheat market, a condition that threatened col
; lapse. July options opened a shade to %@%c
-I lower at 74%Â©74>Â£c and dipped to 74c, rallied
to 74%c, dipped again and closed steady, a
shade higher at 74%c.
Corn was manipulated almost without the
knowledge of the crowd in the pit. Early in
the session September had a good spurt, partly
on bad weather and partly on the boosting of
July by the bulls. On the up-turn September
v.-as sold liberally and all options slid back.
There was talk that one of tne big packers who
was short of SerU'inber corn was about to try
a fight against the bull crowd in July. July
closed %c higher at 07%c September closed
firm, y t c up at CO^c.
Â¦ . Oats were strong and ruled higher, but were
not very active. July closed l'/^c up at 41$ic.
Traders in provisions seemed to be at the
mercy of the packers to-day. These big inter
! ps-te pulled together and in spite of fair llqiii
j dation by outsiders to secure profits good ad-
I vance.s wore made. Hogs touched the highest
price for the year â ?7 92% â and a good demand
followed the Influence. July pork closed 15c up,

cessions, but the demand waa very slack and
sales were extremely sltrw..
Cheese remains as previously quoted, with
ample stocks and a very moderate demand.
While there is no positive decline in Eggs
the tone is weak and there are more sellers at
18c than at 19c. Some dealers do not ask over
18c.- Receipts are too large for this season of
the year, when, so many people are out of town
and the consumption falls to its lowest point.
Stocks are heavy.
Receipts were 100,600 pounds 929 cubes 2

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Strawberries were decidedly weaker, as offer
ings were liberal and a large portion of the re
ceipts were in poor 'condition. The heavy re
ceipts of Blackberries- and Raspberries In
crates from Loom is had a weakening tendency
on the chest goods from other localities. Lo
gans were in ample supply and very few sold
at the top quotation. Currants were In liberal
supply and prices showed a wider range -
A few lots of fancy Black Cherries sold at
4c per lb, but the quotations cover the general
run of offerings. Mostly all the loose stock
went to the canners. Prices of smalt boxes
were unchanged.
Receipts of Cantaloupes are. increasing and
prices are steadily declining.
*Figs were offering freely and met with
prompt sale. There were only a few crates of
Grapes received.
The demand for : deciduous fruits was fair
and choice ripe stock sold readily, but receipts
were too large for the market to absorb 'and
consequently there was a large quantity car
ried over. Offerings of green shipping stock
were excessive and met with slow sale.
The demand for Citrus fruits Is falling oft

larly for Lemons, which are in ample supply

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
direct pressure of stock for sale. The ex
change market has been moving pretty con
clusively toward the gold export point, but
it has been expected that the actual movement
would probably be deferred until July. To
day s event, however, precipitated a with
drawal of credits from London and trans
rerred that pressure from London to New
York. As a consequence it Is generally ex
pected that gold will go out by Thursday's
steamer or on Saturday of this week. The
effect on the. expanded credits of this market
and thÂ© narrow reserve resources is awaited
with some anxiety. Th* weekly crop bulletin
and the backward condition of the corn crop
Indicated was a depressing factor in the lato
dealings. The strength of Reading was ac
companied by report* of breaks in the ranks
of strikers at Nanticoke, Pa, The market
closed dull and heavy.
Some of the speculative bonds were weak in
sympathy with stocks, but strength at other
points made the market Irregular. Total sales,
par value, $2,375,000. -
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Local securities continue very dull and the
daily volume of trading is the smallest for a
long time. { The' oil stocks are also stagnant
and featureless. .The. only news of, Interest
comes from New York, where the 4 per cent
bonds of the United Railroads of. San Fran
cisco have lately been excited. It seema that
some time ago certain-- speculators In these
bonds sold large lines short. | The delivery time
of these contract I sales having arrived, the
buyers have called on . the sellers . to de
liver the goods, but the latter, are unable to
do so as the bonds are largely held by San
Francisco parties, who are not obliged to let
them "go. The effect of this New York mud
dle has been to run up the price of the bonds,
which, opening yesterday morning at $90 bid,
cash, with offerings at $94. closed at $99 bid
and $100 asked. Somebody In New York will
evidently have to do some tall settling before
the muddle gets straightened . out. â¢

Third and Market streets by Policeman
Eastman fox-fast driving over a street
crossing, was convicted by Judge Conlan
yesterday and fined $10, the amount of
his bail money. The Judge remarked that

exceptionally bad one, as some time ago
he drove over a lady on Market street
and seriously injured her.

they are not union musicians â hence another
clash. Â¦ For the sake of harmony I would sug
'geÂ«t to the committee that the parade, music
and carriages be dropped and the efforts be de
voted to literary exercises and fireworks.
I will assist the committee in any way that
I can, but I ask to be relieved of the chairman
ship of the parade committee, as my duties
call me elsewhere. Tours very truly,
W. A. DESBOROUGH.
Chairman of Parade Committee.
GOFF TAKES EXCEPTION.
Max Popper moved that Mr. Desbor
oygh's resignation be accepted, but that,
portion of the letter suggesting the aban
donment of the parade he Ignored. The
motion prevailed. Walter Goff, who is
president of the Labor Council, objected
to the assertion contained in Desborough's
letter to the effect that members of the
union were not allowed to enlist in the
National Guard.
Michael Coffey described how many of
the union men who were now driving
hacks in this city had fought in the Phil-,
ippines. In view of the fact that the mer
chants had decided not to participate in
the parade and as very little money could
be allowed for parade purposes the com
mittee voted to make the parade strictly
military.
At first it had been decided to have py
rotechnic displays only at Eighteenth and
Folsom streets. But as this would de
prive a great number of children of an op
portunity of witnessing the fireworks, . it
was determined to make displays in North
Beach and in Columbia Square. The com
mittee allowed $300 for each display.
It 'was moved that the letter from Mr.
Cornwall be received and placed on file.
The committee decided that it did not
have the power to appoint his successor.
As George B. Keane, the Mayor's secre
tary, was present at the meeting he was
asked what the Mayor had done in regard
to Cornwall's resignation. He answered
that it had been accepted, as the Mayor
had been given no alternative. He in
formed the committee that Mayor Schmitz
washout of town, and as he would not re
turn for a few days, he advised the com
mittee to select a successor to Mr. Corn
wall. The committee, however, refused
to tackle the selection of a new chairman
and passed the matter back to the Mayor
Max Popper argued that it would set a
dangerous precedent for the committee to
: make the selection.
The stormiest part of the meeting oc
curred when the committee called for a
report from the music committee.
PRAISES MILITARY BANDS.
Major Charles Boxton, who had been
elected to succeed Mr. Desborough on the
parade committee, demanded' that Â¦ the
question as to whether the National Guard
bands should or should not be paid should
be decided. He said:
These bands are composed of younÂ» men who
are Just as good as we are. A great many of
them .fought In the Philippines with me, and I
know that they are true and loyal to their
fcourtry, and I believe that they should bÂ« given
/a chance to participate In this celebration.
The only reason that they are not union men
is because the unions have refused them ad
mission to membership. They are willlnR to
Join the unions, and I think that the union
musicians should treat- them as brothers in
stead of antagonizing them.
Despite Major Boxton's appeal, a mo
tion made by Max Popper and seconded
by Walter Gallagher not to pay non-un
ion bands was carried. This leaves the
situation very perplexing, as the Na
tional Guardsmen may refuse to partici
pate in the parade without their bands.
If the bands do consent to play without
compensation, it is extremely doubtful
if any of the union bands which the com
mittee might decide to hire will play
.with them. E. W. Kent promised the
committee that a special meeting of the
Musicians' Union would be held- to-night
when the question bf allowing the union
bands to march with the National Guard
bands would be submitted to the board of
directors.
INVITATION FOR CADETS.
Father Caraher. of St. Francis Church
suggested to the parade committee that
some features be added to the parade that
would commemorate the thrilling scenes
ot the Revolutionary War. He also call
ed attention .to â¢ the fact that the League
of the Cross had . not been invited to
take part in the parade and that the boys
were going to San Rafael to participate
in the celebration. A motion was made
that both the League of the Cross and
the Boys' Brigade be invited to march on
the Fourth. The motion was carried and
Father Caraher. was appointed to try to
induce Â¦ the League of the Cross to cele
brate in this city.

CAPTAIN SCHELL POINTS
OUT A MENACE TO LABOR
Catholics of San Francisco are highly
indignant at the methods adopted by some
person or persons who are collecting
money under 1 the guise of charity. Boxes
have been placed by the impostors at sev
eral street corners to receive contributions
from, the charitably inclined.
One of these boxes is attached to a tele
graph pole at the southeast corner of Sut
tcr and Kearny streets. It is made of
glass and the cover of it Is held tight by
two strong brass locks. Attached to the
box is an American flag and a crucifix.
Until within a few days ago a rosary oc
cupied a place near the flag. Below the
box are a number of small slips of paper
adorned with a cross on which are print
ed a prayer and the inscription, "St. An
thony's Blessing." The prayer concludes
with a suggestion tha^gTaces. both spirit
ual and temporal, wwl be granted those
carrying one of the slips.
The newsboys who sell papers on the
corner of Suiter and Kearny streets say
that the box is emptied ever*- night by a
woman dressed in black, who carries
rosary beads. Sometimes she empties the
box at 4 o'clock and other times as late
as 6 o'clock in the evening. â¢
Several of the Catholic clergymen of
San Francisco have received letters from
their parishioners calling attention to the
peculiar way of collecting alms. The
clergymen say that it is an unheard of
thing and a contemptible act to place a
rosary; crucifix and an American flag to
gether on a public street as a means of
attracting the attention of passers-by to
a charity box.
A prominent Catholic clergyman, whose
attention was drawn to the box yester
day, became highly indignant. He said
that he considered that it was a fraud
Jtnd was put there to lead Catholics to be
lieve that they were contributing to the
"St. Anthony bread."' which, among
German Catholics, is similar to the Amer
ican "poor box."
The Rev. Father Maximilian Neumann,
Superior of the Franciscan Order and rec
tor cf St. Boniface's Church, when inter
viewed by a Call reporter concerning the
presence of the box, said:
"I think the matter should be looked
into by the police. The slips that you
have shown me are similar to some that
were distributed at the dedication of St.
Boniface's Church last Sunday by un
known persons. Many of my congrega
tion have called on me and showed me the
papers and they are highly indignant a.t
the imposition."
Father Raphael, rector of St_ Anthony's
Church, at Folsom and Army streets, said
last night: "I am grieved beyond measure
to hear of this disgraceful scheme to de-
Iraud pious persons.
"It is easily decognized as a swindle."
continued Father Raphael, "as no nun is
ever seen on the street after sundown.
Besides, a nun never goes outside the con
vent unattended. . She is either accom
panied by one of her number or a young
lady from the convent. As to the slip you
have shown me. it does not contain St.
Anthony's. blessing at all and is simply a
device of the impostors to lead unsuspect
ing rxsctflft to contribute funds to a
mythical charity." ,; ; .
Xieg Broken by a Telephone Pole.
Joseph Furrer, an employe of the tele
phone company, who resides at 515 -Pine
etreet. had the two bones of his left leg
broken yesterday while at work at the
Junction of San Bruno avenue and Twen
ty-fourth 6treet. Furrer. with others of
his companions, was erecting poles, when
cne of them slipped and struck him on
the leg.
Judge Sloss sustained the demurrer, but
grave District Attorney Byington ten days
in which to amend his complaint, In or
der, he said, "to give him an opportunity
to present a stronger case to the Supreme
Court." â¢ â¢ â¢
Judge Sloss holds that the clause in the
charter giving the bond and warrant
clerk power to fix bail bonds is uncon
stitutional in so far as it refers to a fel
ony charge. "The charter," says Judge
Sloss, "can give the clerk power to fix
bonds in municipal cases, but cannot em
power him to fix bonds on a felony
charge, as it is a State offense."
Hereafter the bond and warrant clerk
and his deputies will not have the power
to fix bail in felony cases. They were
deprived of this power yesterday by Judge
Sioss, who sustained a demurrer to the
suit brought by the city against Daniel
Hartnett and others to recover $2000 bail
money forfeited by .them as sureties for
the appearance of T. Callnan, a police
officer. Calinan robbed a grocery and
also stole two horses from a Larkin
street stable. He was arrested and re
leased on $2000 bail accepted by Assist
ant Bond and Warrant Clerk T. I. Fltz
patrick from Hartnett and others. The
officer never appeared for trial and Hart
nett and his fellow bondsmen refused to
make good their bond. A suit was
brought and the bondsmen demurred to
the complaint on the ground that the
warrant clerk had- not the power to fix
bail bonds in felony cases.

Mr. Erwin will be assisted 'by special
agents M. de la Montanya "and E. C.
Clement, who have been ordered to report
to him for duty on* July 1. ,
CABRIERS ARE NEEDED.
Those who desire the delivery must be
prepared to put up at their own expense
secure boxes in accordance with/ the
orders of the department. Such are some
of the Important facts relative to the ser
vice furnished by Mr. Erwin and they will
be valuable to those who will seek to bo
put at once in daily touch with the. affairs
of the world from which, by reason of
non-delivery of mail daily, they arc prac
tically remote.
The purpose in the rural free delivery
Is not to grant a suburban delivery to
cities included in the free delivery service
nor to establish a village free delivery.
The end in view fs to give postal facilities
to those who have none and to carry tha
mails daily to remote communities, tho
residents of which would otherwise have
to travel from two to twelve miles to re
ceive their letters and newspapers. The
roads to points to be reached must be
good. This. is an essential requisite.- No
route can be established under ordinary
circumstances that is less than twenty tt^
twenty-five miles in length, or which
serves less than 100 families. Over the
route the carriers are. not expected to
travel more than once per day. . ;
Communities and localities will probably
be prompt in making application for the
advantages conferred by free rural de
livery. In the country to be included in
the Pacific Division there are already
established 200 routes, .approximately, of
whlch j ;: the majority are In" California.
Manyinew routes will be added in all di
rections in the year ensuing. Mr. Krwlu
anticipates that the opportunity will be.
taken advantage of by enterprising harnr
lets all over the coast. While the terri
tory is vast it contains only about 4 per
cent of the total population of the United
States and the people are widely sepa
rated.
CAUFORNIA NOW LEADS.
ON Tuesday of next week a Pacific
Division of the Rural FreeDeli%'ery
Service of the Postal Department
will be established. The official
who is intrusted with the im- (
portant work of organizing the district is
J. W. Erwln, assistant superintendent of
the rural free delivery system of the
United States. He is already busily en
gaged in arranging the preliminaries.
The area that will be embraced in thÂ©
Pacific district will be of vast extent, be
ing, in fact, one-fifth of the entire surface
of the continental territory of the United
States. In it are. included the States of
California, Washington, Oregon. Idaho,
Nevada and Utah and the Territory of
Arizona. Generally speaking, this coin
cides with the boundaries of the Pacific
Coast division of the Railway Mail Ser
vice, taking in an equal area.
This will be great news to suburban
dwellers on the Pacific Coast, for It means
that mail facilities that they have enjoyed
or hoped to enjoy will be provided much
more largely than has heretofore been
possible. In the last appropriation bill
for the postal service the amount to be
devoted to the rural free delivery service
was doubled and the great extension of
routes was in view. To that end the
money will be expended. Probably there
is no one in the United States mail service
who has had wider experience than Mr.
Erwin in organizing large enterprises for
the benefit of the receivers of mails. His
appointment to this important post will
therefore be reason for general satisfac
tion.

I would therefore recommend to your hon
orable body, that the committee do not parade
and that . the appropriation for parade pur
poses, $800, be turned back to the city and Its
taxpayers.- I have incurred no contracts nor
expenses, except my time, street car fare and
small incidental expenses, which I will stand.
"What there is left ot the National Guard in
San Francisco on the Fourth will par ad? by
themselves, as is customary with them. They
are not required by law to turn out with the
civic organizations. 'If they turn out by them.
selves we have no need to furnish them musk-,
but if they turn out with us as part of us we
must accent their bands and pay them, and
Mr. George <R. Wells. Vice Chairman of
Fourth of July Committee â Dear Sir: BusN
ness has called me away this afternoon, so
that I cannot be at the Fourth of July meet
ing. I have this much to report: That owing
to- the resignation of our chairman the mer
chants have seen fit to not participate in the
demonstration. The fact that the unions will
not allow their members to belong to the Na
tional Guard has made ill-feeling all along the
line. .
. Hardly had Vice Chairman Wells finish
ed hiSiappeal for peace when W. A. Des
bsFough'siletter of resignation as chair
man o^,the? parade committee was read.
â¢Ic was as. follows :
DESBOROTJGH'S LETTER.
The resignation of Desborough and the
announcement of the discontent of the
merchants, were tha least of the commit
tee's trouble's. When a report was re
quested from the music committee the
general icommittee found â¢ itself in the
meshes of a most perplexing situation.
Because of , the deficiency in funds the
committee had decided that the street pa
rade should be strictly military. E. W.
Kent -of the Musicians' Union announced
that the music committee was unalter
ably opposed to paying the bands of the
National Guard anything for their serv
ices. He said that these bands were non
union.. The committee took a vote on tho
Question .and decided that no money
should be allowed to non-union musicians.
As the parade is to be limited to military
organizations and . as the National
Guardsmen will probably refuse to turn
out unless furnished with music, the
prospect of a parade does not appear
very promising.
* Tn the absence of a regular chairman
Vice Chairman George R. Wells called
the meeting to order.*. Anticipating that
the meeting would probably carry the
committee through a very tempestuous
sea, he pleaded for harmony and invoked
the spirit of peac^ in the memory of the
patrlot*bldod that was shed at Yorktown,
Valley Forge and -in the great Civil War
to abide with the" members of the com
mittee during their deliberations. His
supplications were in vain, however. :
TBOUBLE OVER MUSIC.
This was from W. A. Desborough, and,
besides announcing his resignation as
chairman of the parade committee, in
formed the committee that the merchants
had decided that they would not-partici
pate in the celebration. This announce
ment proved a rather disheartening blow
to the plans of the committee. The mer
chants nad manifested unusual Interest in
this year's observance of
day, and a number of firms had signified
their intentions of placing floats in the
parade. The ., resignation of Chairman
Desborough left, the committee in a mud
dle in regard to the parade, as he had
practically taken upon himself "to make
all arrangements and had succeeded in in
stilling some enthusiasm into the mer
chants. Mr. Desborough stated in his let
ter that* merchants were dissatisfied 'be
cause Mr.. Cornwall had resigned.- te
When George Filmer surrendered the
office of grand ,r marshal . the .committee
hoped that: the unions "had been (entirely
placated," but- yesterday's meeting in the
California Hotel showed that trouble in
that direction had but- commenced. As
soon as the meeting was called to order
a letter was read from Bruce Cornwall
announcing his resignation. The commit
tee already knew that Cornwall's resigna
tion was in the hands of Mayor Schmitz
and his. letter .created no surprise.. The
next communication, however, not only
furnished a surprise, but for a moment
seemed to put an end to all hopes of a
sireet parade. . ' Â»
The Fourth of. July Committee is strug
gling with -a dilemma which appears al
most hopeless of : a' satisfactory- solution.
Unless- some very decisive action is taken
within thenext few days toward clearing
up the "clouds' of confusion under which
the committee is laboring, this year's
celebration, .'and especially the street pa
rade, will probably prove a fizzle. Since
the committee was appointed its pathway
has been anything but strewn; with; roses
and now -.- step seems' to \ uncover a
new thorn of contention. Â¦- ~- Â¦ ~
