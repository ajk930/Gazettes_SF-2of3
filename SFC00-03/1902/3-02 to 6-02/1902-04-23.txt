SOLDIEBS ON GUARD
AT PEKING LEGATIONS
Unusual Precautions Being Taken to
Prevent Another Attack
by the Chinese.
PEKING, April 22.â In spite of the fact
that, in order . to allay the uneasiness of
the masses, Chinese officials have been
urging the immediate return of the Dow
ager Empress to the palace, she has de
cided, according to to-night's Gazette, to
remain at the Hunting Park, five miles
Xrom Peking, for one week.
Rumors of some political coup, possibly
the deposition of the Dowager Empress,
ere rife. They are apparently as baseless
es the other recent canards. The foreign
legations here continue their unusual
precautionary measures. At. the Ameri
can legation a squad of soldiers patrol
the wall every night.
-A bold criminal, who essayed the role of
both strangler and highwayman, made a
brutal attack upon a young woman named
MTss Magrane at the corner of Central
avenue and Halght street shortly after 10
o'clock last night. Armetl with a piece
of pliable. wire the brutal fiend came upon
the, young 1 woman from behind and with
out a word of warning twisted the wlra
around her neck and then, applying his
entire strength, he made a desperate ef
fort choke her to death. Miss Magrane
struggled gamely in the grasp of the
strangler and managed to scream loudly
several times before she began to lose
consciousness.: She was on her way horns
when she was attacked.
The fiend doubled the wire'.around the
young woman's neck and pulled both
ends, which were protected with cloth
wrappings, so. hard that the wire sank
deep into her neck. Inflicting painful in
juries; from, which she may not recover
for some time.
Fearing, perhaps, that the young wo
man's cries "for help might arouse the
neighborhood the strangler made a vicious
attempt to tear her diamond earrings out.
Miss Magrane fought the savage criminal
with a ' courage seldom exhibited by a
woman, and finally succeeded in freeing
herself from his grasp.
The strangler made another assault
on the helpless young woman and suc
ceeded in wrestling her to the ground. He
tried in vain to pull her purse from be
neath the folds of her dress, where she
had it concealed, and. failing in this, he
again turned his attention to her ear
rings and made a final attempt to pull
them from their fastenings.
Miss Magrane struggled and screamed
as best she could with the cruel wire cut
ting deep in the flesh on her neck, and
soon she succeeded in arousing the neigh
borhood.
The struggle. took place in front of tha
residence of Dr. Ragar^and his wife was
the first to answer the struggling woman's
cries for help. Mrs. Ragan opened 'the
window, and. seeing at a glance that the
fiend was making a desperate effort to
choke Miss Magrane to death, she called
loudly for help. Other neighbors heard
thexries and, lifting their windows, joined
in the
The strangler made a last desperate ef
fort to get his coveted booty. Miss Ma
grane struggled harder than ever when
she knew assistance was at hand. Real
izing that if he stayed in the neighbor
hood a, minute longer he would be cap
tured, the strangler left his victim lying:
on the sidewalk and took to his heels.
Special Policeman Baker heard the loud
outcries and ran to the" scene. Ho ar
rived just in time to see the brute who
committed tho assault make bl3 escape
throvgh the shrubbery in the park. He
ran along one of the numerous pathways
in the park and finally made good his
escape. AH efforts to : trace him, proved
futile. In the meantime Miss Magtano
was carried Into Dr. Ragan's house,
where her injuries were dressed. Tho
physician worked over her for fully an
hour before she was in condition to bÂ»
moved to her. home at 451 Buena Vista
avenue.

Miss Magrane's neck was still encircled
with the wire with which her assailant
had attempted to choke her. The pol!cÂ«
were notified late last night an.] thj
neighborhood was thoroughly searched in
the hope of finding some trace ot tho
strangler.'
Miss Magrane's condition last night was
quite serious. She was roughly bandied
by. the brute. - ami in addition to being
nearly choked to death, received i bad

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. April S2.-Cuban
TÂ«r5procity is to be made a party measrra
In the Senate. Without Democratic aid
the Republican leaders propose to put
through a bill which, if it does not give
ell that Cuba's friends desire, will at
least, in the Senators* eyes, redeem th-3
pledge which their party has made." The
bill may be more liberal than the House
measure. Whatever it may grant, .the
concessions will receive the seal of party
caucus, and the "Insurgents" in the up
per house Tvill have no comfortable lot.
This was determined on at an impor
ts nt preliminary conference held to-day
by a majority of the Republican Senators.
This conference was held in a room 01
the Senate Committee on Finance during
the afternoon sitting of the Senate, and
Â»ss extended for some time after ad
journment.
In the main the Senators invited to par
tkipate were ihose friendly to reciprocity
legislation, but some of the opposition Re
publican members were also present-
In the absence of Senator Allison, who
Is chairman of both the Republican cau
cus and the Republican steering commit
tee, Senator Hale presided. As a result of
the meeting there will be an early meet-
Ing of the Senate Committee on Relations
U-ith Cuba to take up the question on the
lasls of the House bill, which is now be
fore that committee. The Republican
tnembers of the committee will act to
trther in formulating a substitute for tho
House bill, and none of them is to co
tperate wjfh tjte Democratic members of
the committee. Tfce "till 'thus agreed upon
by the Republican members will be sub
mitted to the Republican caucus of the
Senate and be made a party measure.;
The concensus of opinion seemed to be
that a bill granting not to exceed a 25 per
cent reduction should be reported by the
committee, and there was general unan
imity as to the advisability of eliminating
the House provision striking out the dif
ferential duty on refined sugar.

"The development of the system," said
Professor Moore to-night, "was ordered
by Secretary Wilson, and It has been
brought to its present satisfactory state
under his supervision. We believe we
have perfected a telephonic receiver of
value. By means of this receiver we are
able to take messages as rapidly as by
wire. The system belongs to the Weather
Bureau and is fully covered by patents.
We are working over an ideal course, and
I feel confident the system will operate
to the satisfaction of the army and navy
officers who will witness its performance.
But between Roanoke and Hatteras there
is a body of salt water, which materially
aids the transmission. I doubt If it la
feasible to obtain satisfactory results by
wireless telegraphy over fresh water or
land. We do not claim great results for
our instruments. We simply believe that
we have an efficient system for working
over salt -water."
Two stations fifty miles apart have been
establishedâ one on Roanoke Island, off
the North Carolina coast, and the other
at Cape Hatteras. Before tho experi
ments are concluded it is expected that

per hundredweight, ipstead of 5 pence.
He added that in "the case of flour and
fine meals the farmers had been greatly
disturbed by the fear that a heavy tax
on "offal" would offset any protective ad
vantages which they would gain by tho
grain duty.

OF THE PACIFIC COAST
The 16,000-ton battleships will be the
largest ever authorized for the American
navy, and among the largest warships
afloat. The armored cruisers will also be
exceptionally large for their class, con
siderably exceeding the New York and
Brooklyn in tonnage. The amount carried
by the bill is slightly above $76,000,000.
There was a sharp parliamentary/con
test and many votes before the final de
cision on ships and on building in Gov
ernment yards was reached.
Provision is also made for building ont
of each, class of ships on the Pacific
Coast, and that no contractor shall build
more than one battleship, cruiser or gun
boat. . .
.Two battleships of about 16,000 tons dis
placement, to cost, exclusive of armor and
armament, $4,212,000 each; two armored
cruisers, of about 14,500 tons displacement
each, to cost, exclusive of armor and
armament, $4,659,000 each; two gunboats
of 1000 tons each, to cost $382,000 each.
The following provision is made: "That
the Secretary of the Navy may, in his
discretion and so far as his judgment is
practicable, direct that any or all of the
vessels herein authorized be built in such
navy yard3 as he may designate." - Â¦
WASHINGTON, April 22.â The House
Committee on Naval Affairs to-day com
pleted the -naval appropriation -bill. The
most important item, as to new ships, wag
left until. the last, and as finally deter
mined upon was as follows:
House Naval Committee
Completes Appropri
ation Bill.
Other portions of the bill -relate to de
tails of the administration of affairs of
the army. One of .these, provisions au-.
thorizes ihe President to direct that the
funds appropriated for the quartermas
ter's, subsistence or pay departments may
be placed .to the credit of the. disbursing
officers of either of these departments.
"Subject to .the command of the Presi

The above provision is intended to give
the commanaing general a legal status;
which at present ne has not, .and is un
derstood to be in the Interest- of General
Miles.
WASHINGTON. April Â¦ 22.â Senator
Hawley. chairman "o*f 'the? Senate Commit
tee, on Military Affairs, to-day introduced'
a bill to "increase -the efficiency, of the
army." The^most important section of
the bill Is the following? - : "
A great majority of such applicants
Â¦were suspected not of a desire to fight in
the British army, but to secure free trans
portation to South Africa and then im
prove the first opportunity to go over to
the Boers, carrying with them such guns
and ammunition and other equipment as
they may have been provided with.
Colonel Crowder reports that he waa
unable to find any evidence that the Brit
ish officers have attempted to carry on,
recruiting on American soil, either di
rectly or by any subterfuge. On the con
trary, he says, the officers representing
the British army at Port Chalmette and
at Isew Orleans and other points in the
West have refused hundreds of applica
tions from persons who either openly de
clared or intimated that they wished to
enlist.
4. During the two and a half years these offi
cers have paid out the sum of about $13.000,COO
for horses and mules and about $15,000,000 for
forage and other supplies, all of which wera
shipped to the army in South Africa, most of it
upon British transports, owned or chartered.
Since this depot was established, late in 1891).
about seventy-five ships have been cleared from
New Orleans for South Africa, carrying: a total
of about 65,000 mules and about 95,000 horses.
and hundreds of thousands of tons of hay and
other provender.
1. The depot at Port Chalmette has been con
tinuously used as a base of supplies for the-
British army ln South Africa for two years and
a half. . .
2. This depot has been under the immediate
personal supervision and management oC regu
larly commissioned officers of the British army.
3. These officers have not worn uniforms and.
have not used arms or any other means of de
fense than such as were furnished by the local
authorities, but they have signed checks, re
ceipts, vouchers, etc., as officers of the British
army and signed with their rank or title.
This conference was participated In by
the President, Attorney General Knox,
Acting Secretary of "War Sanger and Lieu
tenant Colonel Crowder. Upon Its conclu
sion no statement as to whether any ac
tion will be taken by the President could
be obtained. Contrary to general belief,
however, the report of Crowder, which ho
has submitted, shows that there has not
been the extensive violation of neutrality
alleged by the Boers. The conditions
found by the army officer at Port Chal
mette are thus stated:
CALL. BUREAU. 1406 . G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON. April 22,-There was
an important conference . in the "White
House to-night in regard to the report
of Lieutenant Colonel E. H. Crowder,
giving the result of hi3 investigation into
the conduct of British agents in Louisi
ana.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The original Senate provision vested the
power here given to the Philippine Com
mission in the United States courts and
the corresponding insular courts.
That It shall be the duty of every Chinese
laborer, other than a cit'zen, rightfully in and
cniitled to remain ln any of the insular terri
tories of the United States (Hawaii excepted) at
the time, of the passage of this act. to obtain
in one year after the passage of this act a cer
tificate of residence in the insular territory
Â¦wherein he resides. "which certificate shall en
title him to residence therein, and upon fail
ure to obtain euch certificate as herein" pro
vided he shall be deported from such insular
territory, and the Philippine Commission is au
thorized and required to make all regulations
and provisions necessary for the enforcement of
this section In the Philippine Islands, Including
the form and substance of the certificate of
residence, so that the (same 6hall clearly and
sufficiently identify the holder thereof and en
able officials to prevent fraud in the transfer
of the same; provided, however, that if said
Philippine Commission shall find it is impos
sible to complete the registration herein pro
vided for within one year from the passage of
this act.- said commission te hereby authorized
and empywered to extend . the time for such
rÂ«-:g!Vt ration for a further period not exceeding
one year. "
Sections 5 and 6 of the Senate bill; the
first relating to certificates of Chinese
residents in the insular territory of the
United States, and the second pertaining
in judicial proceedings, were stricken out
by the conference and the following sub
stituted for the two sections:
"Said laws shall apply to all immigra
tion of Chinese laborers not citizens of
the United States from the island to the
mainland territory of the United States,
whether such were in the island territory
at the time of cession or not. or from
one portion of the island territory of the
United States -to another portion of said
territory."
Under the agreement reached by the
conferee? the foregoing quotation will be
the first provision in the compromise bill.
The Senate bill is also made more specific
in its application to Insular territory. The
provision relating to Chinese laborers in
islands belonging to the United States is
made to read as follows:
WASHINGTON. April 22.â The con
ferees on the Chinese exclusion' bill have
practically reached an agreement. The
main features of the Senate bill have been
adepted, but there are some alterations.
When the conferees resumed their ses
sion to-day it was understood that a.
proposition was under consideration to
take out of the Senate substitute the lim
itation of exclusion until a new treaty
v.as made, thus extending exclusion j In
definitely. Another proposition was to
insert the text of the exclusion, law of
1SSÂ£, which the Senate substitute re-enacts
by title, so that no question can arise as
to the certainty of this additional bar
rier. It appeared to-be accepted by all
the conferees that the seamen's clause of
-the House bill prohibiting' the employ
ment of Chinese sailors on American
ships will not go. into the bill.
Ihe agreement reached Js upon all but
one feature of the measure.- Under the
agreement the Senate substitute becomes
the exclusion measure. but the House con
ferees have secured a concession spe
citieally re-enacting sections 3 to 14 of the
exclusion act of September 13, 1SS8. The
point still open is as to extending the ex
clusion indefinitely after May 5 next.
The House bill extends the prohibition
indefinitely, but the Senate limits it until
a new treaty is made. The House con
ferees are insisting on taking out Â¦ t!ie
reference to a new treaty, so that thers
will b.e no limit of time to the exclusion.
Following is the specific provision re
enacting sections of the act of 18SS, which
was inserted at the instance of the House
members:
"All laws now in force prohibiting and
rc-grulating the coming of Chinese persons
and persons of Chinese descent into the
United States,. and the residence of such
persons therein, including sections 5. 6, 7.
a, 9, 10. 11. 13 and 14 of the act entitled
â¢An act to prohibit the coining of Chinese
laborers to the United States,' approved
September 13, 1SS8, shall be and the same
art hereby re-enacted, extended and con
tinued."

Now that the small-bore politicians have ex
hausted their mud batteries It is possible that
Governor Murphy may at an early day ask to
be relieved. . ' , '. 1 . . -
When questioned to-day by The Call
correspondent Governor Murphy said that
for a long time he had been tired of offi
cial life and had retained his office only
because of the manner in which he has
been assailed by his political enemies. He
said' it was quite probable that he would
tender his resignation at no distant day.
It is no secret that Governor Murphy's
successor will be Colonel Â» Alexander Â¦ O.
Brodie;- former ly of "the -Rough Riders,
and that Colonel Brodie received a tender
of the office Jong ago; to take effect upon
the expiration ,-of .Governor. Murphy ! s

It is expected that the case will con
sume several days. Both sides will con
test every inch, and the issue is certain
to be appealed, no matter what may be
the result. United States Senator W. A.
Clark is believed to have an interest in
the case, and it is said that upon the re
sult will depend whether Senator Clark
will become Interested In the Traction
Company's property. It is not believed
that the Southern Pacific or Santa Fe
will be represented during the trial by
counsel, although lawyers representing
both companies may be present during
the hearing in behalf of their respective

LOS ANGELES, April 22.â When United
States District Judge, Olin Wellborn calls
the Huntlngton freight franchise case for
trial on Thursday morning there will have
begun one of the .fiercest legal battles
ever fought In Southern California. The
issue involved Is the freight franchise
granted to Henry. B. Huntington and his
associates by the City Council and vetoed
by Mayor Snyder. The Traction Company,
as weii as the steam railway interests,
with headquarters In Los Angeles, insists
that the value of the privilege Is more
than $1,000,000. Henry E. Huntington was
awarded the franchise for $156,000.
Garret McEnerney of San Francisco,
who has been retained as chief counsel
for the Los Angeles Traction interests,
arrived in this city to-day. He was in

ard made a statement of what he Intend
ed to prove by the missing witnesses. He
alleged that Sharp and Mrs. Zeigler
would , go 1 to San- Francisco together at
intervals during the; two years preceding
the :murder Â¦ and stop at certain hotels.
Also, that during , Sharp's visit to the
Zeigler ranch>he and Â¦ Mrs. Zeigler were
constantly in each other's company. When
Zeigler learned of their conduct, declared
the attorney, he. brooded over It* and
it deranged his mind. This was shown
by the fact that ' while his wife
was in San Francisco Zeigler would
go Â¦ -about exclaiming: "I .want
my Cad; I want my. Cad." A week bet
fore the commission of the murder, said
the attorney, Zeigler walked up 'and down
In front of his house with a revolver In
his hand, and his actions before and after
the crime proved that he was insane.

Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y,: . :^r^t -fe
Gentlemenâ In justice to you, I feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the sample
bottle of Swamp-Root you so kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past five years with kidney and blad-
der trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me for the time being, but the old com-
plaint would in a short time return again. I sent for a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, and I found it did me a world
of good. Since then I have taken eight small bottles bought at my drug store, and I consider myself perfectly cured.
It seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping. I do not have the smarting and irritation, nor do I
have to get up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did three or four times a night, but now sleep the sleep of
peace. My back is all right again, and in every way I am a new man. Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-
Root. - They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise^ of it. It is a boon to mankind. We recommend it to all who
are suffering from kidney and bladder diseases. â¢
'Â¦: My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the blessing you
have brought to the human race in the compounding of Swamp-Root. JAMES COOK.-.
~ Â¦-Â¦ : We remain, yours very truly, HUGH E. BOYLE.
Officers of the 58th Police Precinct, Greater New York. JOHN J. BODKIN.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin taking the famous new discovery. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root, because as noon as
your kidneys are well they will help all the other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for many kinds of diseases, and if permitted to continue much suffering
with fatal results are sure to follow. Kidney trouble irritates the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and Irritable
Makes you pass water often during the d*y and obliges you to get up many times during the night. Unhealthy kidneys
cause rheumatism, gravel catarrh of the bladder, pain or dull ache in the back, joints and muscles; makes your head ache
and back ache, causes indigestion, stomach and liver trouble; you get a sallow, yellow complexion, makes you feel as though
you had heart, trouble: you may have plenty of ambition, but no strength; get weak and waste away.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and is used In the leading hospitals, recommended by physicians In their prlvat*

FAITH IN STUIKERS.
' It is our opinion -that the striking car men
will commit no overt act or in any manner re
sort to violence in their efforts to obtain their
end; on the contrary? We think they will use
their best efforts to keep the peace and assist
In protecting property. . Any different action en
their part would injure their cause and lose
them the sympathy and support of the public.
We most earnestly request them to use their
bent efforts to continue the running of the
California and Union street roads,, believing
that such course will better Â¦ promote their in
terests, as. also that of the public.
' We look with, fear to'the. introduction. of un

In.. the. statement published by the railroad
company last Sunday.lt says: "The company
is. ready at any time to consider carefully any
complaint made by any employe." This state

can it be expected that- they would pay any

"When men are pulled from cars, does
that look like protection?" interrogated
Kelly. ' â¢ '
"Were you there when that. happened?"
asked Â¦Commissioner Mahoney. "I. did
not hear of any such occurrence." Presi

saying that police officers would do their

up. his hat and .retired . from the room.
Â»The- commission' continued with its rou
tine business. V -
Â¦Commissioner, Hutton asked what dis
position had been made of Pinkerton's
case in the police court Kelly replied
that" the case bad. been continued until
Thursday, whereupon the commissioner
stated that he was. in favor of deferring
action until the. case had been settled in
court. The.- other, con
curred in- th!s opinion. , ". .-.".'
Company.' Attorney' Frank Kelly ap
pieared'-for the company and demanded
protection JCronv , the . board. Protection,- as
he required it, meant the arming of
guards, the armings of" : non-union men or
the convoying of cars by police officers.
The ' matter was brought to the atten
tion of the board in the form of an appli
cation to carry a concealed weapon made
by- Samuel Pinkerton. Pinkerton is a
non-union employe of the company who
was arrested Monday for carrying a con
cealed weapon without a permit. His ap
plication was sent in Monday afternoon
by Superintendent Vining's office boy.
and Pinkerton's last night
was upon the request of the Commission
ers that he urge his cause in person.*
Attorney Kelly came to the front first
on. behalf of Einkerton. He pleaded that
his client's, life was in danger and asked
that be be permitted-, to arm-, himself.
Then Kelly made his- argument : general
and asked that many men bÂ£ equipped
with shooting apparatus. In view of the
fact that Pinkerton's case was still pend
ing in the Police Court all discussion on
his ' particular .case wa.s postponed until
the action of the court could be an
nounced. , .. - â¢'*,
Then Kelly put forth his demand on the
part of the company. He desired protec
tion, and his; definition of the term con
flicted with the ideas of the board on
the same subject. Hardly had the words
of his request left his lips than Commis
sioner Newhall interrupted him. The
president of the board resented the effort
of. the company to force Its demands. In
emphatic language, .Newhall said that no
dictation from theÂ«railroad. would be tol
erated. The board would judge. 'Newhail
said, as to what protection should be af
forded and police officers, should judge
when It was necessary ' for . them to exer
cise their authority. There the incident
closed and Attorney Kelly left the room.
. "We desire to run our cars and to have
protection against all violence and in
sult," said KeUy. .'.'This afternoon two
of our men were dragged from the cars
by a mob of about fifteen men. I do not
know whether these men" were strikers
or- members of the rabble, but I do know
that if we' Had had proper guards on our
cars ft' Would 1 not' have happened and the

â¢ -a FTER a spirited debate-lasting
L -/'Jmt more than an hour the Sail
->VrH. -Francisco Labor Council at a
j / B specially called meeting held
UL'f--, JeL last night at Pythian Castle
unanimously indorsed the ac
itlon of the Street Car Men's Union, voted
$400 for its assistance and indorsed thÂ«Â»
action of Mayor Schmitz in endeavoring
to avoid trouble but vociferously, hootert
down a proposition to indorse thÂ» : action
of -Governor Gage regarding the strike.
Some two weeks ago when the proposi
tion to indorse a strike on the part of the
car employes' union- was presented to the
Labor Council the matter was voted
down. . At that time the street car men
felt that they were not at liberty- to dis
close what their intentions were and in
the absence of the information then sought
the resolutions failed of passage by a
close vote. â¢ As the situation was increas
ing in gravity many conferences were held
with the executive committee of the La
bor Council and It was assured 'of tha
.support of the unions affiliated with that '
organization. . ' .
Some months ago as was published ex
clusively in The Call at the time, the
street railroad men were ready to- enforce
their demands. .Spotters were sent out
by the Market Street Railway Company
and wholesale discharges followed. Soma
of the men were restored, but the" leader*
of the union felt that the time was not
ripe and the then threatened strike waÂ»
delayed. The organization was perfected,
with results that are now so familiar to
the public. All this was brought, out in
the debate which followed the presenta>
tion of the following communication fronl
the executive committee of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council:
To the Officers and Delegates of the Sin
Francisco Labor Council: Your executive com
mittee has called you to this special meetl-.*
to act oa the strike of the atreet car;men ft

Your committee recommends that tnÂ» Â»tr*M
be indorsed. It further recommend* that you

. The principal objection to the resolution
came from Delegate Keane of the Sail
ors* Union. He claimed that the council,
after refusing to indorse the strike, would
stultify itself by now indorsing it. His
views were not shared by a majority of
the delegates and a dozen of them were
on their feet at once in an endeavor to
gain recognition from the chair. The ma
jority of the speakers were delegates who
had voted against the original proposition
and they explained that their change ot
feeling was mostly due to the Information
which they had received since from Pres
ident Cornelius and the executive com
mittee of the Car Men's- Union. ..
Secretary Rosenberg in a few woYda ex
aessed reasons why the executive com
4tee had taken this stand,. -', He said in
pact:.- -. _~. â^..'mlS'r \')~* j .'* .
Two weeks ajto your executive committee
recommended to indorse the impend; ns striiw
of the street car men's "union. AVe then thought
the matter mlirht be adjusted, and it was so
stated In the meeting-. 'Â±'hÂ« council then votsvi.^
not to indorse. But aincVthen it has come uÂ» v
this proposition: "Klther let Vising; go through ;
their socket* pr let theft* put up.'r their mitti
and fl*ht." Alter the- vote of the council we:
advised them to keep peace. Then Vining
gathered courage and discharged six men in a
bunch. Vlnlng uroved himself by this action
the best f riena of the car men. . He put them
on their mettle. The offlce of the Labor Coun
cil was in constant communication with them
and we knew that the time had come to strike.
We considered all phases of the strike and
were advised by President Mahon of the in
ternational association to communicate with
the First Assistant Postmaster General in ref
erence to the running of the mail cars, which
we did. It looks like a protracted fight, as the
Baltimore* syndicate owns railroads In many
of the principal cities of the United States.
This entire misunderstanding was caused- by
the previous action of the conunciL If these
men need assistance, let us give them both
moral and financial support. Let them appoint
committees and see to the collection of funds
and pay the money direct to the car men.
Delegate Knox of the Carmen's Union
said the carmen were ready to ca,rry on
the fight themselves. They were prom
ised the financial support of the men' on
the California-street line. '
"Send your men out to the end of the
line, said they to us to-day," continued
â¢ Knox. "Let them hold their union card
in one hand and a hat in the other and we
; will guarantee to fill the hat with money."
As soon as Knox finished his remarks
cries for the previous rjaestton shut off
debate and the resolution to Indorse tho
strike was unanimously adopted by a
rising vote. ". â¢
At the suggestion of the treasurer of
the Labor Council Marcel Wille of, the
Bakers' and Confectioners' Union moved
to pay to the Carmen's Union .J30Q ; from
the funds of the Labor Council. This
was amended .by. E. F. Westoby's motion
to Jncrease the amount to- $400, and the
amendment was adopted by a unanimous
rising vote and considerable cheering.
Delegate Dijeau of the Milk Drivers*
Union secured an indorsement of the
stand taken by Mayor Schmitz in relation
to the strike and his earnest endeavors
to obtain an early settlement. It was
adopted amid great enthusiasm.
"I propose that we indorse also the .ac
tion' of Governor Gage regarding this
strike." said a delegate in- the rear of the
hal|, who sat down so quickly that 'the
chair had no opportunity to recognize
him. There was a chorus of grunts and
"oughs," but no. second to the motion.
Instead, a dozen delegates were on their
feet at once, some with motions to ad
journ and 1 others calling* for 1 Cornelius,
and the proposed Gage indorsement was
drowned by the noise.
President Cornelius briefly thanked the
council for Its action, saying: "All street
car employes except the officials of 1K|
railroad company are. now members ol
the union, and they would have beef
taken in, too, had they ..been eHgfble.
Vlningr says money will buy anything, but
he has at last found something he can
not buy â the manhood and independence
of the carmen."

COPENHAGEN, April 22.â The Lands
thing to-day considered in open session
the treaty providing for. the sale. of the
Danish West Indies to" the United States:
The Foreign Minister, Dr. Deuntzer,
made a strong pro-sale speech, covering
the various arguments of. the opposition
against the sale of the island. He cre
ated a sensation by reading statements
from the United States official publica
tions showing that Estrup, the leader of
the opposition, offered to sell theMslan-ia
to the United States in 1892, when he was
Minister of Finance. Â¦ "- , ; " .
Dr Deuntzer also ridiculed the fear or
the opposition that the United States
Congress might refuse to appropriate
$5 000 000 to purchase the islands, contro
verting the arguments against the treaty
because it did not confer citizenship and
free trade on the islanders, pointing out

most important witness of the day. He
told of Dlmmick's arrest on the night ol
Aucust 9 " 1901, and the conversations that
had taken place between them. Burns
said: . . . -
I took him to my room at the hotel and told
him of his rights in the matter. I told him
he was arrested on three charges of embezzle
ment and that each was as serious as the rob
bery of the $30,000 one. -1 told him that If he
made restitution of the $30,000 or as much of It
as he had that the Department of Justice would
probably deal leniently with him. He did not
answer) me and then I told him that- if he
thought I was trying to trick him into a con
fession I would pledge myself not- to use In
evidence any part of the conversation between
us "We talked for an hour and then Dimmick
said to me: "Do I understand you to say that
if I make . restitution of the $30,000 I am to
*Â°I*tofd him no; that he would have to plead
eullty and take whatever penalty the courtB
Sight inflict. I told him that he had better
Â«Â»nd n. friend or a lawyer to see me, one" who
would rot take what was lett of the $30,000,
and asked him if he had such afrlend. He said
hA had It was understood that' night that he
was to send for a friend.. The next day Dim
mick and myself again talked over the question
of restitution and how it would be possible for
the District Attorney to ask the Department of
Tustlce not to press all the charges. In the event
of Dimmick making -restitution of the stolen
monVv I took Dimmick to District Attorney
Woodworth and the matter ' was talked over.
Woodworth said that he could make.no prom
ises but that he would have to see what the
Attorney Â¦ General would do In the matter.
Woodworth told Dimmick that.he would be fair
with him and do what", was possible for him. ; :
,' Accused .Wanted- to ' Compromise. .
Dimmick then asked me to submit what^evi
drnce I had against him, but I said I coum not
do that 1 told him that If he had some per-,
sonal friend who wanted to help him out of his
trouble he had better send that '. friend to me
and I would i show the . friend the evidence we
ha Two days later Chlckering left his card for
me I went to see him and he said that he did
not know why Dimmick had = asked him: to see
me '' I then told Chickering of the conversations
I had had with Dimmick.- Chickerlntr fully un
dcrstood from me that Dimmick had . indicated
his gullt-io me when I had him under arrest.
Chlckering said to me if -Dimmick was guilty
that he would advise him to . make restitution
and ask' the Government tb.be lenient. .but that
if Dimmick was Innocent, he (Chickering) .would
tell. Dimmick to fight the case.. -.That was the.

Mrs. Boalt has returned to her home
near Clovcrdale, accompanied by Miss

Miss Elsie Sperry entertained a few
friends at dinner, last evening. _
Tells of Dlmmick's Confession.
Secret Service Agent Burns was* the
ing daughters, Miss Catherine and Miss
Alice Herrln, leave to-day for Honolulu
and are not expected to return for several
weeks. \ . ,
Locksmith Ryan testified ; that he had
changed the combinations on all the
vaults of the Mint in January, 1898,' and
that no part of the timelock was missing
as claimed by Dimmick. ., -'
The Government then introduced evi
dence in rebuttal. Lewis Brown testified
to selling a dress suit case at a Market
street store early In March or February
of last year, and said that a young man
named Silverstein had delivered it Â¦ to a
lodging-house in the 400 block of McAl
lister street.
G. L. Metcalf, doorkeeper at the Mint,
said that in January or February of last
year he saw Dimmick putting on a dress
suit while In his office at the Mint, and
that the defendant had an open dress suit
case on the table. Witness said that
Dimmick had asked him how the suit
fitted. â¢ v
Captain Fitzgerald, vault man at the
Mint, denied that Cashier Cole had on
any occasion snatched a gold bag from a
truck, as testified to by Dimmick.
Mrs. It. J. Perry, a lodging-uouse keep
er at 483 McAllister street, testified that
Dimmick had never roomed at her house
and that a dress suit case had never been
delivered there, as claimed by the prose
cution. Â¦ \ .
- On cross-examination Chlckering ex
plained that he had called on Burns at
Dhnmick's request In order to see what
the Government intended to do in the
case and what evidence they had. Witness
was asked as to certain statements made
to him by Burns, but denied that any
such assertions had been made by the
secret service agent.
At the afternoon session W. H. Chick
ering was called by the defense. He said
he had known Dimmick for many years,
and at the request of the defendant the
witness had called on Secret Service
Agent Burns.
Chickering said that Burns had told
him that Dimmick had denied his guilt
and refused to make restitution of money
he had not stolen.. I
Chlckering Contradicts Burns.
Attorney Collins then called Miss Jen
nie Gustafson and Mrs. Fannie W. Dim
mick to testify that Dimmick had never
owned a dress suit case or had brought
one to his home' in the early part of last
year.
A number of witnesses were called by
the defense to testify as to the reputa
tion Â«f Dimmick for "truth, honesty and
veracity," but in cross-examination the
witnesses said that they had not heard
of any difficulties that the defendant had
been involved in in Portland, Or.
Dimmick admitted that In a conversa
tion with Secret Service Agent Burns and
District Attorney Woodworth the latter
had said that he would do the best, he
could do for him.
"What did that refer to?" asked Schles
inger.
"That referred to the general conver
sation of restitution that Burns was
bringing up all the time," answered-Dim
mick. â¢ â¢
The defendant was then questioned as
to his having the combination of Cashier
Cole to the gold deposit vault, but Judge
de Haven sustained an objection of. At
torney Collins that the gold deposit vault
and its combinations had nothing to do
with the theft of coin from the cashier's
vault.
Makes Important Admission.
Dimmick, in cross-examination by At
torney Schleslnger, denied that he had
ever admitted his guilt, to Secret Service
Agent Burns, or that he had asked to be
allowed his freedom if he made restitu
tion of the stolen gold.
"I, told Burns," said Dimmick, "that
I could not maKJe restitution of money I
had not taken, and I would not ask my
irlends to do this. I did not ask W. H.
Chlckering to see Burns and find out
what terms the Government would make.
1 only asked Chickering to see Burns in
order to find out what evidence the Gov
ernment had against me."
"Did you ever say to Burns," asked
Attorney Schlesinger, "that If you made
good the sum stolen from the vaults that
you understood you would be given your
liberty?" .- - . . - Â¦ ; /
"I did not," answered the defendant.
Then Dimmick told of how he stayed
at the Mint on many occasions after busl
nes - hours, many times remaining until
midnight. The defendant sai$ that many
employes of the Mint had worked at
night .during the early part of last year.
Once again Dimmick denied that there
was any truth in the evidence of the wit
nesses who claimed that they had seen
him at the Mint with a dress-suit case,
or that he had carried one on the ferry
boat and train to his home in Oakland.
The Government has contended that
Dimmick carried away the stolen gold in
a dress-suit case early last year, and has
presented many witnesses to strengthen
this contention.
Dimmick Denies ' Confessing.
To-day a Jury will' decide the fate of
Walter N. Dimmick, whose, trial . In the
United States District Court' on a charge
of stealing $30,000 in gold coin from the
cashier's vault of the Hint has been on
for many days. The introduction. of evi
dence was- concluded yesterday ".and; the
arguments of counsel . commenced. ' ;
' A mild sensation was produced in thÂ§
taking of testimony when the Govern
ment-placed Secret Service Agent Burns
on the witness-stand to detail the prac
tical confession of Dimmick that he had
stolen the $30,000 and was eager to make'
restitution if guaranteed immunity from
punishment.
Attorney Collins, for the defense, made
no objection to the introduction of Burns
evidence. On the contray, he asked that
it be introduced. ....:.. 'Â¦'.'.Â¦ Â¦ â¢*.
Burns told of two days! continual deal
ings with Dimmick alter his arrest of
the accused man. during which I period
the ex-chief clerk of the Mint con
stantly asked it he would be allowed to
go free If he made good the solen money,
or if his friends came to the front with
the sum. or the bulk of it. Â¦ â¢<
Dimmick maintained his s usual atti
tude of calmness when Burns \gave- the
damaging testimony against him, prob
ably realizing that it was a question "of
the jury believing his denial as against
the accusation of ihe secret service agent.
When the trial was resumed yesterday
morning Dimmick again took the -wit
ness-stand for cross-examination by the
Government's attorneys. ' Dimmick gave
a praclcal illustration to the court and
jury of how he had tied up his private
books with string and paper and carried
them from the Mint^to his home on the
night when Witness Miller says he saw
Dimmick carrying a dress-suit case.

MANILAâ J. H. S.. City. For \ a long
time the name of the capital city of the
Philippine Islands was written - Manilla,
and the hemp that was grown on the Isl
and of Luzon was named for the city to
designate it from other hemp, and it was
also written Manilla, but for some unex
plained reason one of the *Ts" was
dropped in the writing of the name of the
city, but the spelling of the name of the
hemp has been retained.

\ With full approval of that expression of the sen
timents of the President, the people will expect the
trial of General Smith to be free from any sort' of
concealment or secrecy. ,It has been suggested that
since Waller excused himself by shifting the blame
upon his superior officer, so Smith may plead in his
defense the orders of a still higher authority. If
that should be so, the public ought to know it. In
a matter of this -kind there would be a deep dissatis
faction if it; were even? so much as suspected with
good cause that one officer had been sacrificed as a
scapegoat for his superiors. -
, Fortunately there is no longer any occasion for
suspicion that the whole truth will not be made
known. In his recent order directing an investiga
tion of the charges Secretary Root said: \ "The
President desires to know in the fullest and most
circumstantial manner all the facts, hotrling. being
concealed, and no man being for any reason favored
or shielded. For the very reason that the- President
intends to backup the army, jn the heartiest fashion
in every lawful and legitimate method of doing its
work, he also intends -to see that the most rigorous
care is exercised to detect and prevent any cruelty
or brutality, and that men who are guilty thereof are
punished. '. . Great as the provocation has been in
dealing with foes who habitually resort to treachery,
murder and torture against our men, nothing .can
justify, or will ,be held to justify, the use of- tor
ture or inhuman conduct of any kind on the part of
the American arrriy." ...'../
The desire on the part of the public for a full and
fair investigation is the more insistent because there
is every appearance that an effort has been made at
the War Department to conceal the ugly facts and
keep the country in " ignorance of what has been
going on in the islands. . .
WHATEVER differerijpeVv "of. 1 opinion ' may
exist as to the manner in which'four 'mili
tary operations in the- Philippines have
been or should be carried on, there can be but one
sentiment with respect to the charges of cruelty that
have been made. against the army. /;It is therefore
gratifying that the acquittal of Major, Waller has
been promptly, followed by an order 5 for the court
martial of General Smith, under whose orders Wal
ler claims to have acted in committing the offenses
for which he was fried.
After all that exultation of how "we forced" the
enemy and how "we won," and how- the enemy
"gnashed his teeth," is it not strange that the j com
missioner should be inquiring doubtfully into what
happened during "the last few hours of the fight"?
Before the Platt substitute was put upon its passage
It had been amended out of all semblance to its orig
inal, and the amendments covered the principal propo
sitions for which the exclusjonists have been battling
here against tremendous odds. â¢ â¢ ? When the crafty
schemers were exposed in their trickery they conceded
a line or two of addition to their, bill, making it a little
less disgraceful. . Under ceaseless flre and the threat
that hung in the honesty of the Democratic Senators
and a handful of Republican colleagues the plotters
against our exclusion policy conceded a little more and*
yet a little more and ,yet a little more. Every conces
sion was accompanied : by' gnashing of teeth and was
followed by frantic , conspiracy to foil the. good Inten
tions of the friends of the American wage earner.
On the same day and on the same page of the
Examiner was published a letter from the,commis
sioner in which he said:
The new law will not . expire in two years, but will
continue until a new treaty'* has been negotiated and
ratified. We forced the modification of the original
proposition, for originally the bill terminated with the
present treaty instead of running . until a new treaty
has been given us.
Our fifth proposition wa^ that the new law should
give the Treasury Department clear cut power to frame
all kinds of regulations free of pending leglslationr\We
were fought on that, but we won.
Our fourth proposition was /that, the Philippine Chi
nese should be carefully registered. We were opposed
on that and this afternoon we won. j
Our third proposition was that the Philippine Chinese
should be kept out of Hawaii and the mainland. We
were fought on that up to the last moment.' but we won.
. Our next proposition was that the exclusion policy
should be extended to the Philippines, so- that the China
men should be kept there. We were fought bitterly on
that. We have woa that point.
â¢ WASHINGTON. April 16.â We came here asking
that the- present laws be continued. Our. enemies tried
to prevent a realization of this by an amendment carry-
Ing forward only a part of the present law. Yesterday
we forced them to 'concede our point and carry forwaro.
the whole Scott act. That was victory No. 1.
When the Senate passed the exclusion bill the
commissioner telegraphed to the Examiner and the
Examiner displayed in screaming type these ulula
tions of triumph:
It may be that .the statement is not â¢ strictly ac
curate. The . commissioner may have been mis
quoted, or it may even be that he is not quoted at
all, for the yellow journal does not hesitate to fake
interviews with commissioners any more than with
the Pope or the Emperor of China. Taking it as it
stands, however, it puts the commissioner in a queer
position and raises a question as to his possession of
sense enough to take care of himself when away
from home. â¢ ,
x zESTERDAY, the Examiner published- in - a
y dispatch from Washington' the', statement:
-Â¦Â¦ "The more we study the Platt Chinese billj
said Commissioner Livernash, and the more we
inquire into the circumstances surrounding the last
few hours of the fight in the Senate, the more rea
son there 'is for believing that the anti-exclusionists
deliberately resorted to trickery and that the bill
they put through the Senate is shamefully inadequate
and is intended to kill the exclusion system of this
country."
GETTING AT; THE TRUTH.
A PERPLEXED COMMISSIONER.
If, however, the stage be filled by neither farce
nor tragedy, if events flow smoothly and patiently
to the end of his term and he depart in peace to his
home in Central Valley, New York, the Cuban people
will have written themselves down worthy of their
freedom and capable of supporting the institutions
necessary for its protection.
Now the extreme danger, is that Palma goes there
to ooze the Americanism he has been absorbing for
twenty-five years, and therefore to seem the puppet
of the new master rather than a whole-hearted Cu
ban patriot. In that view the incident is a tragedy.
The immediate future of Cuba is going to be most
interesting to students of civics. Is this fantastic
election of a man practically an alien to be a farce or
a tragedy? It is impossible for him, so long absent,
so long in a different environment, to be en rapport
with the genius of tne Cuban people. It is equally
impossible for them to be at one with the mental
polarization he has acquired in a quarter century's
residence in this country. It is testified by recent
American travelers in Cuba that everywhere Amer
icans are unpopular. This aversion to us increases
2s the regions are penetrated where the revo
lution flourished. Given anywhere a center of
Cuban patriotism and the testimony is that there is
now a center of hatred of Americans. They seem to
have detected in us the airs of a new master.
Out of the nebulous mass of information and lack
of it about General Palma it seems safe to conclude
that he is a native of Honduras, went to Cuba for
awhile when a young man, and a quarter of a cen
tury ago came to the United States, where he estab
lished a school for the teaching of languages. His
interest in Cuba is purely academic, and it is pos
sible that he is a citizen of the United States, where
he claims his home. He not only has not been in
Cuba for twenty-five years, but announces in ad
vance that he will not stay there when he ceases to
hold office, but will return to his home in Central
Valley to end his days!
His election has no more relation to Cuban asr
pirations, no more connection with the agony and
martyrdom of 'the revolutionists, than the election
of Dr. O'Donnell to the Cuban Presidency. In
deed, General Wood might just as well have secured
the election of Richard Croker, or any other
hyphenated American politician out of a job, and
willing to take a four years' billet in Cuba, then to
come back home. Suppose that after the close' of
our Revolution, when we came to elect a President,
in 1789 we had elected a man born in England who
had come here during the war of 1762 but had gone
to France to teach languages in 1764 and had not
been here after that date, and who declared that
after his term he would return to his home in
France! Does any one believe that our institutions
would have survived such trifling with their organ
ization? The essence of our situation was that the
men who made and won the Revolution were
selected to crystallize its results into a government
under which they intepded to live. They did not so
*corn the country as to endure it only while in of
fice. They made its' flag their standard, its laws
their shelter, its soil their sepulcher.
It is a political situation abnormal enough to be
amusing. President Estrada Palma is not personally
known to a hundred people in Cuba. The voters
had other views than his election, but they seem to
have had the idea that General Wood, military Gov
ernor of Cuba and political economist in extraor
dinary for the United States, had decreed the elec
tion of Palma, and resistance was useless. -

FAROE OR TRAGEDY.
THAT, San Francisco is destined at no distant day to become one of the largest shipping ports in the world is
evidenced by the remarkable increase of shipping facilities and. tonnage within the past three years. The.fig
ures are so large as to provoke incredulity, but they cannot be controverted, j Ten years, ago San Francisco had
', but three regular^ foreign-going steamship lines, namely, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, operating
fifteen 'steamers, ranging from 2000 to 5000 tons, plying between San Francisco, China, Japan ana Central American
ports; the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, operating three 5000-ton steamships between China and
Japjm, and- the'Oceanic Steamship Company, operating five 3000-ton steamships between San Francisco, . Honolulu
and Australia. The coasting lines were the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, operating sixteen steamers,, ranging
from 350 to 3300 tons; the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, with two steamers of 2300 and 2800 tons, re
spectively; the ;; Alaska Commercial Company, with four steamers, from 350 to 1000 tons, and various other owners,
operating about forty steamers on the coast ranging from 300 to 600 tons. They, together with fifteen cannery
tenders' and ten whalers, completed the ocean fleet. In 1872 the total tonnage of ocean-going steamers at this port
Avas 58,769 tons. The greatest progress has been noted within the last three years, within which short period there
have been added many new lines and vessels of large tonnage, together with important additions to the regular lines
in the shape of modern. steamships. The total added tonnage for the past three years is 368,000 tons. Several of the
/new '"vessels' hereafter mentioned are not yet in commission, bujt.all will be before the close of the present year. The
following list of. additions made within the past three years. shows also a marked improvement in size, power, pas
senger and ; freight capacity arid speed. The following is the list of added vessels with dimensions and tonnage,
% and it will be :; found invaluable for reference. It makes a showing unparalleled in the shipping history of the world:

That is the record . of William R. Hearst as an employer of labor in California. . It is
difficult to decide whether he is the more "yellow" as a newspaper proprietor, or as an or
chardist. It is evident, however, that he gives to white labor nothing more than words,
but he supplies Chinese with work and wages. .
The people of the county have no hesitation in declaring, their dislike of the "China
town" which Hearst has established- on his estate. One of the pastors. of; Palermo cays:
"It is a crime when so many of our own people are able and willing to work that they
are nevertheless superseded by Chinese, an element that is a menace to the people of our
own blood." . One cf the leading orchardists of the county says: "Hearst, could gei all
the girls he would need to pack his fruit crops. Chinamen get the work at his grove,
to the exclusion of white labor. I have known whole families to come in .wagons and
wait and wait and wait in the hope of employment, but their waiting' has been in vain."
Hearst's fondness for Chinese is accompanied, according to all reports, by an equal
fondness for their filth and foulness. : They are housed in what is described as "an old
shack," and from thirty to fifty of them, according to the demand for labor at the time,
are crowded together without regard for cleanliness or dqcency. One resident of the
vicinity says "they live like pigs." . . , '' .", .. _ : .. â¢
The story of Hearst's employment of coolie labor! on his estate- near Palermo, in
Butte County, was told in full in The Call of yesterday.- It is a story that affords a
complete explanation of why Hearst is making the^ exclusion fight j as infamous and dis
graceful as he can. For the past two years Hearst has employed Chinese to do 'every,
kind of work on his vast estate, an.i he has done so despite the fact that there is an ample
supply of white labor in the vicinity. It is to be noted/. moreover, 1 that when the, Hearst
orchards were let to others the pickirfg and the packing of the fruit were done by white
labor. It was not until Hearst resumed his direct control and management of them that
white men had to go and Chinamen found a patron. . \l;-
The public has not been able to understand why a man who professes to be so eager
to bring about the passage of an exclusion bill should be so offensive iii his method of
advocating it. Hearst, however, has been quite consistent in his course. '. He has ho de
sire for the success of the bill. He has no objection to Chinese -labor in .California. On
the contrary, he is himself an employer of Chinese, and has excluded white labor in or
der to make way for it. .... , : -v ... Â¦ - -:;Â¦â¢*' \ p: \ - J "':
Not content with such efforts to discredit the bill by so offensive an Â¦ advocacy; of Jt,
Hearst has gone further; he has assailed with ceaseless, vituperation - every one who has
objected to the details of the particular bill Hearst has chosen to support: He has thus
not only ignored what the Congressmen of the Pacific Coast arid elsewhere^have^ done to
advance the passage of the exclusion act, but he has lampooned and maligned by word
and by picture all whose qpinions differ from those which" his papers are clamoring for. .
In carrying but tho se tactics he has spared no taunt nor insult in any quarter. De
spite the fact that early in the session a large majority of the members of both houses. of
Congress explicitly and emphatically declared themselves in favor of enacting an exclu
sion law before May I, Hearst's organs have incessantly boasted that they would "force"
Congress to pass the bill/ they would ''lash" Congressmen into voting for exclusion.
They have depicted Congress as an "enemy of American labor" with whom Hearst *is
doing battle, and every step taken toward exclusion has been trumpeted by the Hearst
organs as a Hearst victory. . Â¦ ) : , I ".-. Â¦ ' i - '.â¢,'.Â¦ â¢.; Â¦Â¦<Â¦. *. : .

When Plerpont Morgan was here with
the Episcopal Bishops last autumn he
made the remark that San Francisco was
hardly aware of her unlimited possibili
ties, but evidently there were Eastern
men at that time who were keeping a
watchful eye on the city's development.
Perhaps to the far-seeing Morgan is due
this welcomed desire of Eastern financiers
to come here and invest their fabulous
capital. Â¦Â¦';..- -,
The coming of John Wanamaker as a
permanent influence in the commercial
world of this city is evidence indeed of
the growing Importance of the com
munity and shows that some of the fore
most financiers of the world loolc upon
tnis wonderfully favored metropolis aa a
most advantageous ground for tne invest
ment of many millions of money.
John Wanamaker is one of the most
conservative and at the same, time one
of the most fortunate of America's cap
italists. It is only some six years ago
that he added to his famous Philadelphia
store the great establishment of the late
A. T. Stewart of New York City, which
until that time was conducted by a com
pany at the head of which was the late
Judge Hilton. The establishment under
the Hilton management could not be
made to pay. Whether the failure was
due "to the extravagance of Judge Hil
ton's sons and son-in-law, who comprised
the partnership, or to other reasons was
never satisfactorily explained, but the
fact remains that until John Wanamaker
took hold of the immense establishment
the business had proved a disastrous
failure. â¢ ââ â¢
No sooner was the magic name of W an
amaker placed over the portals of the
great building than the store was and has
ever since been thronged by patrons at
all hours of the day and at all seasons
of the year.
The Wanamaker store of San Fran
cisco is to be conducted on the same lib
eral principles that characterize the con
duct of his establishments In the Eastern
cities, with the difference that in the new
building being erected by Flood he will
have the rare advantage of an absolutely
modern building, combining every con
venience and architectural elegance.
Wanamaker has already signed the lease
for me basement and first two floors of
the new and imposing building wnich is
being erected by J. c Flood on the site
where once stood the Baldwin Hotel, at
the corner of Market and Powell streets.
That the eyes of the great financiers
and merchant princes of the East
ern States are longingly turned toward
the opportunities offered by San Fran
cisco lor profitable investment Is once
more demonstrated by the news
which The Call is in a position to give
this morning" of the determination of
John Wanamaker to open an establish
ment in this city that will rival his mag
nificent .Fhilaaelphia and New \oric
stores.

A frlghjfcned cur dog belonging to a
Japanese accidentally caused the death
of Giuseppl Ertola, a plumber residing
with his family at; 1510 Dupont street. Er
tola was returning' home from work last
Monday afternoon, and when he reached
the corner of Dupont and Pine streets
the dog ran between his legs, tripping him
up. i Ertola fell heavily to the pavement,
striking his head against the curb, frac
turing his skull. He was taken to his
home, where after telling his wife and/
friends - how the accident happened I . he
lapsed into unconsciousness and died at
10 o'clock yesterday i morning. He was
secretary of the Garibaldi Guards and
left a wide circle of friends.

Col. W. D. Sanborn of the Burlington
Receives a Pleasant Surprise at
Â¦? /His Office.
The men on "railway row" are having
a great laugh on Colonel W. D. Sanborn,
general agent of the Burlington route in
this city. Yesterday Colonel Sanborn
celebrated his fifty-first birthday. On his
arrival at the office in the morning he
found Â¦: an elaborate birthday cake placed
on the . too of his desk. I The cake was
brilliantly ' illuminated' with - J sixty-one
candles, which had been' lirhted prepara
:tory to his arrival.
Colonel Sanborn prides himself upon his
youthful 'appearance and the placing of
sixty-one candles on the cake he deemed
a gross libel. He declares that A. Ot
tinger, the ticket broker, sent the cake
over to him.

The Immortal Pecksniff was well done,
but not In quite sufficiently oily vein, by
H. Barfoot. His discomfiture, was keenly
enjoyed by the audience, who' took
a childlike delight in seeing . the Â¦Â« smug
villain unmasked. J. G. Taylor was excel
lent as old Martin Chuzzlewit, and an
other very convincing bit of work was
the Mark Tapley of Ernest Stallard. Miss
Ellen O'Malley was a very dainty Mary
Graham, looking and acting the part with
much charm. The rest : or the cast was
acceptably filled and the staging was of
the best. "Tom Pinch" goes for to-night
and to-morrow evening.
"Tom Pinch" is rather a series of pic
tures than a play proper, however, a. very
discreet and characteristic selection of
scenes from the novel. All of the "Martin
Chuzzlewit" characters of prominence ap
pear In the cast, and the chief incidents
ol the book are. woven Into a pleasing
summary of the story. The first act drags
in places, but in the second and third the
dramatic quality, with â¢ the help of the
good character .drawing, holds the inter
est very effectively.
Again the strength of Mr. Willard's
company was exhibited | in gratifying
manner. As Tom Pinch Mr. Willard him
self has a part that suits his personality
without a wrinkle. He manages com
pletely to obscure, his natural grace in
the gentle awkwardness -of the fine, sim
ple â¢fellow and without a suggestion of
caricature paints the portrait with fasci
nating faithfulness. It is wonderfully
finished work, and with a fine, true note
of pathos struck throughout. There were
many wet eyes in the house as Tom, with
his shattered Pecksniff before his eyes, is
driven from the only home he knows,
manfully silent, though a word would
save him. ' Â¦"':Â¦-.". :
Tears, the highest tribute to the actor's
art, were Mr. Wlllard's in abundance last
night for his exquisite characterization
of Tom Pinch, one of the quaintest 6f the
Dickens creations, j More applause than
has greeted the clever player during his
present engagement was also his, and the
second curtain fell amid ! applause, that
lasted until it was again raised for the
last act.
PRESENTS "TOM PINCH"
IN| GBATTFYING MANNER
The taking of testimony at the trial of
John T. Rilcy, charged with the murder
of Otto Ekbert, a non-union teamster, on
Townsend street, between Third and
Fourth, on November 9 last, was com
menced before a jury in Judge Cook's
court yesterday. The defendant's mother
and wife sat beside him. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Greaney conducted the
prosecution, and the defendant was rep
resented by Attorney John J. Barrett.
The most important witness examined
was Mrs. Alma Miller of 32 Clyde street.
She testified that on the evening of No
vember 9, about 6:05 o'clock, she was on
her way home from the corner grocery.
It was raining hard at the 'time. She ob
served a man walking in' front of her,
and when she was within three feet of
him another man, whom she positively
identified/ as the defendant, struck the
man in front of her a violent blow on the
left side of the head with a piece of pipe.
The* assaulted man, who was Ekbert, fell
to the ground on his hands and knees,
and then with a groan fell flat on his
face.' The defendant dropped the piece of
pipe, stooped and turned Ekbert's face
upward, looked at it and then dropped it.
The defendant then walked away along
Ritch street, j When the defendant rose
from his stooping position she had a look
at the side of his face. She also got a
good look at his back while he walked
away. She was cross-examined at con
siderable length as to alleged contradlc- ,
tory statements she bad made, but stuck
to her story that the defendant was the
man who struck the fatal blow.
Detective T. B. Gibson, who arrested
the defendant, testified to a statement
made by the latter at the time of his ar
rest in an opium resort at 512 Bush street
that he had been at the otflce of Nolan,
Jones & Manning, for " whom Ekbert
worked, at 5 o'clock- on the afternoon of
November 9, and was at 512 Bush -street
at 7 o'clock smoking opium with two of
his friends. He also testified to finding
the mate of the iron roller with which
Ekbert was struck in another truck in
Nolan, Jones & Manning's barn.
The other witnesses examined were Cor
poral George W. Russell, who produced a
diagram of the scene of the murder; Po
liceman David Koegel and William E.
Jones of the draylng company, who came
across Ekbert's body on Townsend street.
Ekl ert had been employed by the com
pany for about three months and drove
the truck formerly driven by the defend
ant, who had given up Bis job voluntarily
prior to the strike.
The case will go on this morning.

The committee to arrange for the com

to Bakersfleld to attend the carnival and
street fair, has secured a rate from : the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railroad
people of $12 90 for the -round trip, which
includes the sleeper. The committee has
also been working over the itinerary and
has modified the original plan so that' in
addition to Bakersfleld, a visit will be
paid to Vlsalla, Hanford, Tulare, Fresno
and Madera on the homeward trip. Â¦;-'Â¦â¢
In order to ascertain how many busi
ness men will make the Bakersfleld' ex
cursion, a letter has .been addressed by
the committee of arrangements to the sec
retaries of the several commercial bodies
of the city, requesting that the members
of the various organizations who" Intend

Guardlola's estate is estimated to be
worth $25,000,000. The greater portion of
it Is located in Guatemala, where/luardi
ola was interested in mines and snipping
The property in this city is wsjrth sev
eral hundred thousand dollars. Â»
Mrs. Guardiola is but 31 yo<ars of age
Her husband at the time of Ids death was
more than 70.
Slgmund Green of the London, Paris
and American Bank petitioned for letters
of administration upon the estate, acting
under direction of the widow. The Pub
lic Administrator also petitioned for let
ters of â¢ administration, claiming that
neither of the, wills was operative in Cal
ifornia. The petitions will be heard by
Judge Troutt to-morrow.
The deposition practically disposes of a
contest over the estate of the' wealthy
Guatemalan planter. When the disputed
will, which gives the vast 'estate of Guar
diola to his wife and daughter, was filed
here, a second will executed by the plant
er ten years before was presented for
probate by -Page, McCutchen & Page,
who claimed that It was the last testa
ment of the deceased. , . .
The will of Jose Guardiola, bearing date
of March 10, 1897, is his last testament,
according to the deposition of his widow,
Mrs. Rosario Guardiola, which was filed
yesterday in Judge Troutt's court. Mrs.
Guardiola sets forth in the deposition,
which was taken in Paris, where she re
sides, that she witnessed the making of
the will, and her testimony is corrobo
rated by David Cahn, banker, who. with
Mrs. Guardiola, signed tHe document as
a witness.

Paine's Celery
v Compound
THE USE OP
Paine's Celery Compound is the one
true specific recognized and prescribed
to-day by our most eminent and our most
honest practitioners for diseases arising
from a debilitated nervous system. You
need its use this very day; your condition
demands it; common sense and a knowl-
edge of what Paine's Celery Compound
has done for others should be your guide
at this critical time of your life. PAINE' 9
is the kind that makes sick people well!
See that the name is on both bottle and
wrapper. Da not be induced to take a
substitute or any imitation; you need tha
kind that has cured others.
"Weakly, sickly and disease laden mor-
tal. It is madness. to defer the use of that
health-giving medicine that has rescued
and saved its tens of thousands in every
land.
"Well meaning and really worthy peopla
often err 'when sickness and disease coma
to them. Too often they are content to
follow blindly the advice of second rats
physicians, who In - nine cases out of
every te?n fall to properly diagnose the
Ills they are called upon to cure. Too
frequently our sick people put their trust
and confidence In commonj advertised
pills, nervines, sarsaparillas and other
liquid concoctions. Terrible disappoint-
ments and results come to the users of
such medicines; sickness and disease are
aggravatedâ their dangers vastly In-
creased.
Happy are the people who, . when : dlJH
ease has laid its hand upon them, use Dr.
Phelps' life-giving prescription, Paine's
Celery Compound, a medicine that stands
without an equal for feeding exhausted
nerves, purifying the blood and building
up the weakened and run down system.

According to his confession, the mur
derer at nrst reprimanded his brother in
consequence of several repetitions of his
criminal proclivitie-3. The latter, however,
assumed a defiant attitude, and this ex
cited the former to kill his brother with
a canesword.
It appears that the murderer is a pho
tographer and the victim, nis young
brother, a pickpocket, who had been im
prisoned six times. The murder took
place at the photographer's residence on
the 10th of March and the corpse was con
cealed under the varanda until midnight
on the 6th Inst., when the murderer
shipped the bedy on a train, intending to
dispose of it in the country.
The man who came to make delivery of
the box was at once arrested and sent to
the local police station, where he con
fessed that the- body was that of his
young brpther, and that he and the con
signee were the murderers, his name be
ing Ishibf Eijiro.

.PHILADELPHIA, April 22.â The tomb
In which the body of Bishop JohnJ. New
mann was placed forty- two years ago was
opened to-day by a special ecclesiastical
court, the proceeding being one of the
final acts preliminary to the beatification

made in secret and was for the purpose
of identifying the remains of Bishop New
mann and to ascertain their state of
preservation. â¢
Two witnesses swore that they wit
nessed the burial of the Bishop and two
physicians wrote a minute description of
the remains. They were then placed in
a new coffin and restored to the vauit,
which was sealed by Archbishop Ryan.
The evidence collected by the ecclesi
astical court during its inquiry, which has
been in progress for several years, will
i:ow be forwarded to Rome.

The local commercial bodies express
their approval of the request of their sis

action in the matter is earnestly sought.
Â¦ It is stated that claims amounting to
about $2,000,000 for the destruction of prop
erty must be paid at an early date. The
territorial government has already, spent
JSO7.0O8 solely for the maintenance of
those rendered destitute by the fire. It
is urged that, as the customs and postal
revenues were at that time being trans
ferred to the United States and as Hawaii
was left with practically no Income, the
Federal Government should now extend
its aid. An extreme monetary stringency
is said to be oppressing Honolulu at pres
ent.

Considerable speculation had been in
dulged in prior; to the election regarding
the choice for head coach. Dr. FranK
Simpson, who successfully piloted the ef
forts of last year's team, was looked upon
as a likely man for re-election, but his
private practice made it impossible for
him to allow his name to again go before
the committee. Â«
James R. Whipple has been chosen to
coach the University of California foot
ball eleven next season. Lloyd A.* Wom

are among the cleverest football players
California has ever produced, and their
selection by the student executive com

SELECTIONS FOR TO-DAY.
THE "getaway" season now In pro
gress at Oakland is productive of
many wild and startling tips.
Some . come through, others do
not.
Ned Dennis and Annie Max both caught
a quiet play yesterday at odds of 15 and
20 to 1 and delivered the coin. Further
down the line Matin Bell did the same
thing, only at a shorter quotation. The
only; two favorites to score were Dollle
"Welthoff and Tizona, and they were not
pronounced ones. The fields were again
large and difficult to handle at the post.
El Pilar was installed favorite over the
big bunch starting in the opening seven
furlong selling affair, and was beaten In
a drive by Ned Dennis, a 20 to 1 shot.
Fogg bad the mount on the last named
entry, and getting away! well to a strag
gling start never lost the lead. First Shot
came from the rear, taking show honors.
Ten three-year-old fillies furnished the
next betting affair, lining up 'for a flve
furlong sprint. Nonie closed a mild fa
vorite, and after getting away badly
failed to show any speed. After Knock
ings had shown the way into, the stretch
Annie Max, a 12 to 1 shot, piloted by
Prior, strode to the front, winning easily
from EsternelL Third place fell to Hal
xnetta.-. . â¢- Â¦"Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ .--'Â¦Â¦
A very ordinary lot of two-year-olds
contested for the third nurse, the distance
being a half-mile. On the strength of her
win the day before Amoruna ruled a stout
favorite. Troxler did not get the filly
away frcm the barrier well and was never
prominent.. See on Clarinette, a 6 to 1
Bhot, slipped his- company, winning all
the-way. J. H. Bennett stood a drive
gamely, taking second place from Tom
Mitchell.
Jocky Johnny Hoar landed the Futurity
course sprint with Dollle Weithoff. a luke
warm IS to 5 choice. The mare assumed
the front position before the stretch was
reached and, ridden out, finished nearly
two lengths before Mike Rice, against
which 20 to 1 was laid. Katie Walcott
lost the show to The Miller by a neck
Chinn & Forsythe's filly Matin Bell had
a big following when it came to bettln*
time on the mile selling event. Her odds
were cut -from 6 to 4, and after getting
away from the barrier eleventh threaded
her way to the front, scoring easily from
Dawson, a 10 to 1 outsider. Quadra the
favorite, piloted by â¢ Bill Knapp., gave It
up after showing in a prominent position
to the stretch. . .
Almost any one of the eleven starters

looked to possess a chance, and there was
no decided favorite. With the result In

Elaborating upon his argument in favor
of securing generous peace terms Ham
mond unfavorably compared Kruger's at
titude with General Lee's "Christian and
patriotic action." But he warned his
hearers to learn a lesson from another
chapter of the American Civil War by
avoiding the mistake of the American
statesmen who endeavored to govern the
Southern States by Northern office
holders, as a result of which many years
elapsed before the harm done by the "car
pet-baggers" was repaired.
Such a statement, coming from one who
in the same speech referred to his im
prisonment at Pretoria on account of his
nnti-Boer tendencies, produced a striking
effect.
Hammond explained the depth of and
reason for American sympathy with the
Boers, and he impressed his hearers with
Great Britain's total lack of effort to
counteract the pro-Boer sentiment In the
United States. With equal frankness he
urged that Great Britain be generous in
her demands. "Your American friends,"
he declared, "most earnestly hope that in
arranging- terms of peace wide liberality
will be shown to the Boers." . ....

This suit is brought for the condemna
tion of a thirty-foot strip of land through
a ranch of 160 acres belonging to the de
lendants for the purpose of erecting a
pole and wire line for the transmission
of electricity. The case was previously
tried last November before Judge E. Li.
Ham ot the Napa County Superior Court.
'i tie jury In that trial assessed the dam
age of the strip of land sought to be
taken at $45 and found that the remainder
of the tract of land through which the
pole line ran had depreciated in market
value thereby to the extent of $567. The
defendants were awarded damages in
these sums. The plaintiffs moved for a
new trial, and the motion was taken un
der advisement. Subsequently Judge Bur
nett made an order letting the plaintiffs
into possession of the land sought to be
condemned upon payment to the clerk of
$1000 to cover damages and costs, pending
the actions. This money was deposited
and the pole line completed between Napa
and Petaluma in order that the current
might be transmitted to the southern part
of Sonoma County and into Marin
t-'ounty.
On February 1 of this year an opinion
was handed down by Judge Ham granting
the plaintiffs a new trial. The court held
that the damages assessed by the jury
were excessive, and that they were as
sessed against a great preponderance of
evidence. He ordered the verdict set
aside End granted a new trial.

SACRAMENTO. April 22.â Hereafter it
will be extremely bad form to die in Sac
ramento in time to be burled on a Sun
day. The clergymen, undertakers and
backmen have practically come to an
agreement to discourage the holding of
Sabbath funerals, and at the next meet-
Ing of the Ministerial Union it Is expected
the â¢ clergymen will pass formal resolu
tions in accordance with this purpose.
Rev. A. B.- Banks, pastor of the First
Baptist Church, expressed the sentiment
prevailing among the pastors when he
said to-day:
"I am decidedly in favor of the proposed
change. Sunday is a very busy. day with
a minister, by reason of his church ser
vices, Sunday-school and meetings of
young people." . -
Rev. C. L'. Mlel, rector offst. Paul's
Church, said he had often been called
upon to officiate at three or four funerals
on a Sunday after his church services.
The leading three undertakers of the
city have rallied to the support of the
clergy, saying that while they cannot
absolutely decline to bury a person on a
Sunday still they desire to aid In dis
couraging the fashion. .
The hackdrivers are standing in with
their friends, the ministers and under
takers, while on the other hand the lodge
men of the city are considerably worked
up in their opposition - to the - departure.
Jacob. Alexander., deputy grand chief
ranger of the Foresters of America, said
to-day: "" -v - "" ,
"I do not speak for the Foresters as. an
organization, but my opinion is that. this
and all other fraternal orders would pre
fer that funerals be held on Sundays
whenever possible. Members are fined for
non-attendance .upon the , funeral of a
brother member, and by having the
funeral on a Sunday members can attend
without loss of time from their work.
If the funeral be held on a week day a
member will have to lose half a days
work or pay his- fine for non-attendance.

â¢ The duty of framing the call for the
next Republican State Convention will da
volve upon the foregoing executive com
mittee, and it remains to' be determined
whether, the Gage scheme to appoint del
egates in certain counties will . be toler
ated. The committee may be forced to
yield to . Gage dictation-, Â¦ but there are
several - stalwart â¢ Republicans In the list
who will fight to the finish on the propo
sition that the people must hayÂ© a voice
In the election : of delegates. :.'
That the said State Convention shall consist
Of 6S2 delegates, AND ALL OF SAID DELE

the view that a resolution- directing that
all delegates shall be chosen by primary
electlon will 1 be adopted. , The committee
that issued the call for the Republican
State Convention at Santa Cruz, August
28, 1900, to select nine Presidential Electors
is still in power. The call for that con
vention contained this provision.
Republican j State Committee.
. Several weeks ago The Call gave the
alarm that ! Gage's gang would attempt
to pack the convention with appointed
delegates. Subsequent events have justi
fied the note â¢ of warning. In Tuolumn*
and Calaveras the appointing game will
be tried. There may be fairness and
firmness enough in the executive body of
the Republican State Central Committee
to provide In the official call for the con
vention that delegates must be chosen at
a primary election. -The law is mandatory
so far as twelve cities of the State ate
concerned. Delegates â¢ to represent San-
Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, San
Jose, Sacramento, San Diego, Stockton,
Pasadena, Vallejo. Berkeley, Alamedd
and Fresno must be chosen, in 1 th^ man
ner directed by the primary election law.
Proxies are not recognized by the law.
For instance, if -Henry C Dibble- fails of
election In the Forty-first District he will
be compelled to go to some county', where
the primary law does not prevail' to ob
tain a proxy. The law also includes Sac
ramento/ hence if Grove Johnson fails of
election in that city he will be obliged to
go elsewhere fora proxy.
The Gage programme is to : pack .tHe
nominating convention with ' the Bulls,
Dibbles and Pendletons and trust to their
fine work of - manipulation for favorable
results. â¢; > ; >-Â»> â¢ - -.:.
Trying to Pack the Convention.
The Humboldt County delegation to the
Republican State Convention has been
promised to Gage. The bargain provides
that' the goods shall be delivered to the
machine manipulators by J. C. Bull, the
county boss, and S. A. Campbell, Col
lector of Customs at Eureka. The "pro
gramme also provides that no primary
election shall be held, but that the dele
gates shall be appointed by the county
committee. It Is now up to the Repub
lican citizens of Humboldt County to de
cide whether the Gage political machine
or the voters of that county shall select
the men to represent Humboldt In the
State Convention. The persistent claim
of the machine gang that Humboldt was
solid for Gage has excited the suspicion
that raw work of some kind was in con
templation. If the scheme to appoint del
egates named .by Bull and Campbell is
carried out the splendid Republican ma
jority in Humboldt County will be greatly
diminished. :

Promises .Reward of Greater Laurels
FAMED FIGHTERS
HOLD REUNION
The story follows . the history of the
times dating from the fall of Sedan,, and
its scenes are laid In London, Chiselhurst,
Paris and Africa. The latter placets
where the unfortunate prince met his
â¢death at the hands pt Zulus. - .
Emery undertook no easy task when. he
ventured to write a play which required
extensive historical . research, . and his
friends are congratulating him on the
success which the critics say will greet
his production.
i "The' Prince Imperial" is the story of
the life of Napoleon Eugene Louis, Prince
-Imperlal'Of France, son of Napoleon III.
As an attempt has not been made before
to depict on the stage the career of this
prince, whose tragic, fate forms an inter
esting chapter in. the history of the Bona
parte family. Emery!s play will.be appre
ciated by students of history and by, ad
mirers of the romantic drama.
Â¦t-^DWINT. EMERY, the actor who
I appeared at the Alcazar and Cen- 1
fl* tral Theaters in the role of lead
. Â» " -^ Ing juvenile, has a flight
into the more inviting and some
times more lucrative field of playwriting.
He .has: written a historical play entitled
"The Prince Imperial," which is said by
the critics to have considerable merit. As
to the correctness of the critics' judg
ment, the public will soon have occasion
to pass their opinion,, as Frederick Belas
co has promised an early production of
the play. He .Is of the opinion that it con
tains many of the elements that produce
success.

Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ For some time past United States In
ternal Revenue Agent Burt" M. Thomas
has been investigating the cases of cer
tain so-called social clubs which have'
been violating the internal revenue laws
by selling liquor without having paid the
special license tax. Several of the clubs
obeyed Agent Thomas' order and paid the
license tax, one exception being the West
End Social Club, of which the president
is James H. O'Brien, well known In pugil
istic circles, the treasurer Al Neill, the
prizefighter,- and the- secretary Frank
.Dougherty. This organization gave
weekly hops, together with the trimmings,
at the Temple Mall, 117 Ellis street. Upon
O'Brien's refusal to pay the tax begin
ning July 1, 1901, Agent Thomas swore to
a complaint yesterday before United
States Court Commissioner Heacock
charging O'Brien with an offense against
the internal revenue laws, and upon this
complaint O'Brien â¢ was arrested by- the
United States Marshal and released on
$250 ball. Thomas stated yesterday that
each member of the club was responsible
for the tax, and that unless it were paid
promptly he would procure the arrest of
Treasurer Al Nelll and Secretary Frank
Dougherty. , The minimum penalty for the
offense is a fine of 5100, or imprisonment
for six months, and the maximum. Is a
fine of $1000, or imprisonment for two
years, or both such fine and imprison
ment.

Eastern Livestock Market,
Silver had a rally. The speculators' spurt in
America was taken full advantage of to drive
the shorts to cover. Grand Trunk ordinary is a
pure gambling counter. The stock has risen
In the past fortnight from 9% to 11% There
is a suspicion of American buying for control
Stocks to-day were fairly brisk and cheerful,
considering the Passover settlement to-morrow.
Consols, were harder. American shares moved
cautiously after yesterday's fireworks. They
began nominally above parity and remained
steady with some buying of Southern Pacifies
and Union Pacifies, but New Tork flattened
both. New Tork supported the market In the
street, the Coalers and especially Erie being
bright, and Louisville and Nashville, and South

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW TORK. April 22.â To-day's stock mar
ket had the appearance of being . tired. A
gallant rally was made against the depression
and the sympathetic influence of rather ag
gressive, strength developed in some" of the
Eastern railroad stocks had the effect of check
ing the selling in the Western field so that the
losses were, at one time pretty generally re
covered. ,_But the. action lof:. Reading! strongly
indicated a culmination of ' the upward move
ment in that stock and the taking, of special
profits and an afternoon rally in the wheat
market reawakened the anxiety felt for the
winter wheat crop. The Western railroad
stocks fell away to the lowest of the day and
the gains which had been established elsewhere
among important railroad stocks melted away.
The market closed active and weak und gen
erally at the lowest. A. violent break in Sugar
to 122% alter selling up to 127% was a con
tributing cause to the late weakness and was
attributed to the growing apprehension that
the differential duty on sugar will be removed
or the Cuban reciprocity bill will fail. The
upward fight of Nashville, Chattanooga and
St. Louis was due to the report, subsequently
denied, that the stock would be changed fcr
Louisville and Nashville. The early recovery
in the market was stimulated by reports of
showers in the winter wheat belt, but the
grain carrying roads showed a nervous tone
throughout and the real sustaining influence
in the -market was the buying of -the coalers,
both hard and soft; and the Morgan railroads.
The evidence of realizing in Readins left the
market vulnerable again to the Influence â¢ of
a rally in the wheat market, although that
was said to be partly due to the heavy de
crease during the week in the visible supply
of wheat. Speculative opinion is resigned to
the hope of only an average winter wheat crop
under promising conditions and is prepared
to expect a crop disaster in the event of un
favorable conditions. ' A reassuring effect was
produced by indifference expressed by the prin
cipals in the Northern Securities Company to
the filing of the suit In the Supreme Court
against the company on the ground that the
consolidated, ownership of the properties is
safe in any event, elnce only the method of
holding them . is aimed at by the suit. But
any decision which would defeat the purchase
of the constituent companies by the exchange
of their etock for the stock of the company
would have far-reaching consequences on many
projects under way and to which Wall street
locks for great results. London turned seller
of stocks in this market to-day, after â¢ having
been a buyer for several days and thus helped
to strengthen the foreign exchange market.
Speculative bonds were weak and the mar
ket generally was irregular. Total sales, $3,
345,000.

FORECAST.
WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
Temperature â 7 a. m., 4S degrees.
San Francisco dealers eay that the above
refers to shelled almonds exclusively, and that
the frost has damaged the crop only in those
pections which produce the almcnds solti
ehelled. Other sections, from which the nut^
ere sold in the shell, promise an immeM
crop.
The New York Journal of Commerce says:
frivate mail advices from Sicily, referring to
the almcnd situation there, state: '.'Recent
reports of damage to the coming crop in the
Karl section as well as in others have not
been seriously exaggerated, although it will
take a little time to tell exactly the extent
in outlying districts. It is pretty generally
conceded, however, that the Barl section has
been badly hurt and some estimates firure a
total loss. The market until quite lately ad
vanced on both Fr>ot â¢ and futures, but has
since reacted, declining a fraction on spot, the
advance having been so rapid as to check buy
Â¦ ing interest in speculative quarters. At the
present time there is a good, steady market,'
Â¦with sellers quoting the equivalent of 22%c
laid down at New York, for prompt shipment."

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, April 22.â Reports of rains in
the wheat belt tended toward an early demor
alization of the wheat pit j. Advices kept com
ing in, however, telling: of the almost i parched
condition of the' growing shooters and stating
that the' rains were by no means sufficient to
save crops. Those . who . thought prices would
go rattling, down soon moved to Â¦ release^ their
short lines.' The Southwest had weakened ma
terially on the rains,- but soon advanced above
Chicago prices.. Clearing weather was report
ed where the rains were most needed and an
unexpected rise in prices followed. May open
ed "(Â©-tic to %@%c lower at 74Vi@74%e and
sold oft to 73%@7.4c. .Then came Bradstreet's
report -of 0.600,000, bushels decrease in the
world's visible and good buying resulted. Com
mission houses that had sold -, liberally early
t >r- the Southwest bought back rapidly. The
local crowd was bearishly. affected because the
weather., was!- somewhat; cloudy in Chicago.
This with reports 'of > more rains Southwest,
caused a little late selling, and after -May had

Interesting. Programme Will BeCar-
ried Out Saturday at New Chil
dren's Playground. .
The gymnasium. department of the Co
lumbia Park Boys' Club will give, an.in
teresting, exhibition^at the new . children's
playground next Saturday afternoon at, 2
o'clock. The programme arranged for the
day; is as follows: .Entrance of the' boys
in military uniforms, led by the drum and
bugle corps of twenty-two pieces; setting
up exercises; intermission of ten minutes
during which a' change of uniforms -will
be.made to gymnasium, suits; running
broad jumping; body-building exercises
class work on -parallel bars and' buck
25-yard dashes by the entire gymnasium
membership. . Â¦ â¢Â».,
This programme serves to illustrate the
thought . underlying the club physical
training, which is to create a' body of
tycys' evenly developed In every depart
ment of gymnasium work, rather than a
small 'collection of star gymnasium Â¦ per-'
formers. The head worker of the club is
Sidney S. Peixotto, and Charles Merz is
gymnasium instructor.
PREPARATIONS for the Irish Fair
are ; going on without . cessation.
Seventy skilled artisans and deco-'
rators are working night and day
to construct in Mechanics' Pa
vilion miniature representations of the
famous castles, towers and churches' of
Ireland. When the work is completed it
will be possible by visiting the fair for. one
to-gain an idea of the historical scenes of
Erin. Every one of the thirty-two coun
ties will have a booth for the a*splay of
its resources, and the festival will un
doubtedly be the most elaborate and
magnificent of its kind ever given in this
State, if not in the entire country.- '-..
Visitors to the fair will pass through a
representation of the famous St. Law
rence Gate of Drogheda, This massive gate
is the best preserved of the many-ancient
gates of Drogheda. It is more than ninety
feet in height. . On its stone sides and on
the surrounding walls may still.'.be 3een
the abrasions made by the .cannon bails
during many sieges. "When complete, ths
fortifications to which this gate was.tno
entrance covered sixty-five good Irish
acres. The famous priory of St. Lawrence
stood near this historic passageway 'and
from it in all probability the gate derived
its name. ..It was not on/the side' of tV.e
town that bore the brunt of Cromwell's
ciesporjte and successful, assault in Sep
tember, 1649. ' and thus escaped the .'.e
.â¢iruction met with by the other portions
of the fortifications. Antiquarians , deem
this gate one of the most Interesting ruins
of Europe.
Malahide Castle to Be Shown.
Around the sides of the Pavilion will be
COLUMBIA \ PARK BOYS
TO GIVE AN /EXHIBITION
arranged many, booths, constructed in:im
itation of historic castles and towers. One
â¢of the most noted of these will be Mala
hide Castle, the original ; of which stands
in County Dublin, near the village of
Malahide, overlooking the island of Lam
bay. This castle, belonged to theTalbots,
who. like their- neighbors, the St. Law
rences k of . Howth.'.'have managed to hold
on tO'their -possessions ' around Dublin
since 1172, 'when Henry II of.- England
granted the' lordship of Malahide to one
Richard Talbot, brother of Sir . Geoff rey,
who had performed, important service in
England for Henry's mother, the remorse
less Empress Maud. 'Â¦â¢/'Â¦Â¦ . ; . â¢ >"
This. castle preserves the characteristics
of the Plantaganet period, although it has
v been, changed. slightly and added to on
Several occasions. 1 â¢ The front, â¢ with | its
castellated towers and ivy clad buttresses
i still makes a very imposing appearance
and its representation at the Pavilion will
be one of the features of the Irish fair.
Like Going Back to Olden Days.
A view of the Malahide Castle and also
the other famous scenes will be like mak
ing a trip back into the splendid days of
chivalry. It i is calculated- that* the fair,
will ; be. a great, educator to the young
Irish-Americans who have never had the
opportunity- of- treading the -.'sod of the
land of their '.ancestors. ; .
. The Irish people of the' city are making
great arrangements" for >the fair. Each
county has its representatives and they
are laboring incessantly to have their
booth and .their exhibit surpass all the
others. * There < is considerable friendly
rivalry in this respect, and nights at home
and entertainments: are being given to
raise the necessary, funds.-. It is estimated
that 90,000 feet of lumber and several thou
sand feet of buntiifg will be used in decor
ating the . interior of- the Pavilion. The
work of constructing the castles and tow
ers is being done: by Shea & Shea, the
architects, and they have selected Charles
j B. ...Tidball to superintend the work.

siderable notoriety a few days ago by
causlng the arrest of II. W. . Hyers, her
husband, on a charge of attempting to
take her life, and then refusing to pros
ecute him, filed a suit yesterday for an
injunction restraining N. A. McConaghy
from withdrawing the $1000 deposited by
him as bail to secure her husband's re
lease from prison. She charges that Mc-
Conaghy will, unless restrained by the
court, withdraw the deposit and convert
it to his own use. The money, she al
leges, was given by her to McConaghy.
. City Attorney Lane filed an important
opinion yesterday relative to the mode of
procedure on the part of the Board of
Supervisors for the acquisition of the
Geary-street road. Lane holds that,
though the . franchise of the corporation
does not . expire until " November, 1903.
there is nothing to prevent the city .from
beginning preliminary proceedings at once
for. a bond issue with the view of having
the municjpality operate the line as soon
as- the franchise' expires. Lane further
advises that only one election is neces
sary for . the submission to the electors
of the proposition to construct a street
railroad and to incur a 'bonded indebted
ness : therefor. Continuing, Lane says:
It seems to me the plain dictum of common
sense that the city . is . not to be compelled to
await the termination. of an existing franchise
before itself preparing to build and operate a
street railway, if such is its desire. There is
no provision of the charter nor of the statutes
which requires any legal proceeding to be taken
by the city upon the expiration of a franchise.
The franchise, as I have said in a previous
opinion, dies upon November 6, 1903, by virtue
of its own conditions. The street then becomes
free for other occupancy. | The city, knowing
this, may determine In advance what its policy
as to such street shall be, and proceed, prior
to . the expiration of the franchise, .to have
plans and estimates made for a municipal
street railway, to present to the people at an
election the proposition of acquiring such util
ity and Incurring a bonded indebtedness there
for, and upon the issuance and sale of the
bonds the city may make ready, by purchasing
equipment, construction of buildings and other
wise, to have its .own road '-equipped and In
operation as soon as may be physically possible
after the franchise of the Geary Street, Park
and Ocean Railroad Company expires.
Roadbed Belongs to the City.
. The position which .-I should advise the city
to take is that the roadbed and subway now In
position are fixtures attached to the realty;
that the Iron, cement and stone of .which they
are made have become a part of the street and
cannot be removed without the consent of the
city. V
When the franchise has ceased to give the
Geary Street, Park. and Ocean Railroad Com
pany the right to, use the streets for railroad
purposes, such company becomes a trespasser If
It attempts to tear up the street without per
mission of the city, and - the roadbed and sub
way, though not, perhaps, the removable tracks
themselves, are at the disposition of the mu
nicipality. I mave held In a previous opinion
that ; a franchise not accepted and used Â¦ was
abandoned. If my information is correct, the
franchise granted to the Geary Street, Park
and Ocean' Railroad Company to connect the
Geary street road with a line on Market street
was never accepted and used, and I accordingly
hold that such a franchise does not exist and
does not stand in the way ot the proposed mu
nicipal railroad. Â¦
Only One; Election. . Required.
In no* opinion but one election is required for
the submission to the electors of the proposition
to construct a street railroad and Incur a
bonded Indebtedness therefor, when the Board
of Supervisors determines the necessity for such
construction and bond Issue. Two â¢ elections
may. be required by the charter, when under
section 3 the electors petition that the question
of acquisition . be submitted to them, and the
Supervisors do not so determine, but upon this
question I. do not. pass. It, Is said In section 3
that "nothing in 'this section shall be ao con
strued as to prohibit the Supervisors from re
sponding to the aforesaid petition * â¢ â¢ by
proceedins at once"- under section 6. and "from
proceeding thereafter to acquire the same In
Â¦ the manner., hereinafter provided."
. I have given much consideration to this ques
tion, because I am aware that It has been the
opinion of some that two elections .were neces
sary in such a cgse as : Is here presented, and
there is some general language of very doubtful
meaning In section 2." and particularly tn section
V which would justify such opinion, were It not
for what appears | to me .to.be the specific and
definite language of the sections which I have
quoted. - Â¦ Â¦.-Â¦Â¦Â¦
In answer to your questions as to when can
the. proceedings Â¦ t or Â¦ the .acquisition, construc
tion and operation of this proposed municipal
read v be commenced? How. and in what form,
shall, said proceedings be taken? When shall
each step In said proceedings be taken? If my
Information is correct, you have already begun
the proceedings required by the charter looking
to the construction . of such road by securing,
through the City Engineer, plans and estimates
for such railroad. ; This beins so, I am not
aware , of . any reason - for, delaying an election
longer than may be necessary to complete the
new registration which is now : proceeding.

CITY MAY TAKE
ACTION AT ONCE
The investigation into the charge
against Sykes consumed so much time
that the argument which was to have
l>een n;ade by opposing attorneys in the
trial of Professor William Zimmermann
â¢who is accused of lack of discipline, was
postponed until this morning.
John Prosek. attorney for Sykes. char
acterizes the proceedings as an attempt
at blackmail and says that Sykes will be
able to explain the charges away.
Section 142. Any employe of the School De
partment who willfully fails or neglects to pay
bis or her just debts, having- the ability to do
fo, shall bo *unj?ct to suspension or dismissal
from the department.
The only way in which Sykes can es
cape trial by the Board of Education will
be for him to agree to pay the debts
which, it is asserted, he has contracted
snd neglected to pay. The rule which
Sykes is charged with violating and which
may prove his undoing is as follows:
Directors Mark and Roncovieri when
asked about the case did not deny that
The charge mentioned had been made
ugainst Sykes and intimated that the mat
ter was a serious one for the accused
pedagogue. The Directors further said
ihat Sykes would be compelled to answer
further charges which would be filed
against him this morning by . certain
tradesmen for failure to pay for goods
sold him.
Sykes was closeted with the Board of
EGuctition for more than three hours in
an endeavor to explain why he had not
paid the money he had borrowed in viola
tion oi an express rule of the board. None
of the Directors were willing to discuss
the accusations made against Sykes at
The end of their inquiry. They explained
that the communication containing the
Â» barges against Sykes was sent by Mrs.
Swail to .President Denman personally.
The laiter, however, had laid the matter
before his colleagues to determine on a.
course of action.
Sykes has been cited to appear by the
board to answer the allegation of Mrs.
Swail that he had repeatedly : borrowed
sums of money from her aggregating an
amount exceeding *liÂ»j. Tlie money was
borrowed by Sykes during the last live
years and he had given in return certain
promissory notes to secure payment of
tJi<? loans.
