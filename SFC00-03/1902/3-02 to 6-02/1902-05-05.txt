The .American forces who -attacked the

episcopate, which he said had been the
only one to send him a collective letter
of greeting'upon : the 'occasion of hisjubi

health of Archbishop Corrigan^||Bi$BS
The news that Archbishop Corrlgan was
worse came- as a surprise to-night, for the
statement given out earlier in the day
was of v a| favorable 'nature.' It'.- Is' now
known that his weakness is such that he
is unable to retain solid food. Absolute
quiet is maintained in the sick chamber.
"His condition is grave, indeed," added
Dr. Keyes, "and there is a possibility that
he may get worse, and this will hold good
for several days. He is so weak that if
h.j were taken"from his bed he could riot

"Archbishop Corrlgan is by no means
out of danger," said Dr. Keyes, "and his
weakness continues. There are no favor
able indications; he shows absolutely no
interest in worldly affairs and evinces no
liveliness whatever. If he did evince a.
desire to know what "was going on in the
world it would indicate that he was re
gaining his lost strength. There was hope
that he would even express a desire to
get up as ho is, but he has not shown the
slightest Inclination to get up, sleeping

In Germany especially it is a matter of

LONDON; May 4.â The tardy official ad
mission of . the real nature of the* illness
of the Queen of Holland, which the Asso
ciated Press was able to announce April
17 from Amsterdam, may be regarded a3
an indication of a very grave crisis in her
Majesty's condition and, coming- so sud

imminent , recovery, it will cause a shock
throughout Europe. Apart , from the dlf

No apprehension is felt for the safety of
the diplomats in Peking. The United
States has 150 men, and other nations have
equally strong guards in that city. Be
sides there are troops stationed on the road
between Peking and Taku, so that in case
of an attack upon the litigations a way
for retreat is open and protected. What
concerns the authorities is not the safety
of diplomat?, but the possibilities that
may arise from the delicate situation
which a general uprising would create.
Minister Conger has not reported to the
State Department that the outbreak in
Chili Is anti-foreign, but the dispatches
reporting the murder of a French priest
clearly indicates its character.
DIPLOMATS ABE SAFE.
Carning out this demand, the Chinese
Emperor issued an edict declaring that
"If hardened and incorrigible malefactors
should again secretly organize anti-for
eign societies they shall be punished by
death, as well as those belonging to these
societies. They shall not be shown the
slightest mercy."
One of the demands made by the powers
inlSOl was that every anti-foreign eociety
should be at once suppressed and persons
involved in it should be punished.
It is of the utmost international import
ance, therefore, that the Chinese govern
ment should succeed in suppressing the
revolts which have occurred in Southern
China and ChilL The Foreign Ministers in
Peking will make earnest representations
to the Chinese government with a view of

WASHINGTON, May 4.âThe principal
feature in the programme of the House
this week will be the bill to place three
new stars in the American flag. The om
nibus bill for the admission of Oklahoma,
New Mexico and Arizona to Statehood
will be called on Tuesday.
The friends of the bill do not desire pro
tracted debate on it and will try to secure
a vote on that day. There 13 much opposi
tion to the bill on the Republican side of
the House on the ground that the Terri
tories are not yet fitted for Statehood, but
the friends of the bill entertain no doubt
of its passage. The Democrrats in caucus
agreed to give It their united support, and
at least sixty Republican votes are count
'ed on. j \
To-morrow is District of Columbia, day.
After the Statehood bill Is disposed of,
war claims will be given attention and
then the naval appropriation bill will be
taken up. Three Important, measures of
general legislationâ the Hill financial bill
terminating the coinage of sliver dollars;
the Ray anti-anarchy bill and the Shattuc
bill codifying and extending the immigra
tion laws^-are to be taken up whenever
opportunity occurs, the Rules Committee

In connection with his plan of the great
grain pool, Phillips is planning the estab
lishment of the biggest grain brokerage
in the world with headquarters in Chicago
and Eastern branches at Cleveland, Pitts
burg. Philadelphia, Buffalo, Rochester,
Syracuse, Albany and New York. Phillips
and Dunfee would not tell what happened
in their conference to-day. The scheme
of Phillips, it was said by friends of Dun
fee, is to take influential capitalists in the
market to purchase wheat ana corn which
they will manipulate through their great
brokerage establishments.
"Grain prices will remain at the high
mark for the next few months," said
Phillips to-night, "and I do not believe
we will ever have cheap corn againâ not
twenty-cent corn as we had in 1SD6. at
least."
Phillips met John Dunfee, the Syracuse
millionaire contractor, who controls more
ready cash than any other man in Central
New York. To-day several other wealthy
men called on him. To-night he left, for
New York, where to-morrow he expects to
see representatives of the Elkina-Widener-
Brady syndicate.
John Dunfee is a prominent member of
that ring. W. L.. Elkins Jr. and J. E.
Wldener of Philadelphia and Anthony N.
Brady of New York are leaders of the
great street railway, gas and electricity
combine and William C. Whitney, another
member of this coterie, formerly Secretary

It would seem from the best Informa
tion obtainable that no one can give even
a giiess as to what will be the result of
the meeting of district officers called Ijv
President Mitchell for Wednesday nexÂ«
There are eleven district officers in the
first district and as many more in each
of the other two districts. Only twentv
five of these were in New York. The
statement of these twenty-five was not
formally canvassed, and there is no one
â¢with any definite idea how the eight ab
sentees etand. When all come together
President Mitchell will report the results,
or lack of results, of the conferences, and
eubmit to them the question of what thev
propose to do about it. Under the action
of the Shamokin convention the district
officers have full power to declare a strike
or adopt whatever measures seem to them
best suited to meet the emergency.
MINERS ALL IN DOUBT.
As to whether or not the miners con
sider this latter as the gain of an impor
tant point Nichols was silent. It is like
ly, however, that it is considered impor
tant, for it is only logical that if the
president of a coal company is willing t.j
hear from his employes through the offi
cers of their union the local superintend
ents cannot with becoming grace refuse
the same thing. It was stated that one of
the coal men at the conference expressed
eurprise In hearing that one of his dis
trict superintendents had refused *to grant
an audience to Nichols.
SCRANTON. Pa., May 4.-District Pres
ident T. D. Nichols of the United Mine
Workers returned Saturday night from
the New York conferences with the coal
operators. Like all others who attended
the conference, he was not inclined to
talk at any length on what was done. On
only two things he would permit himself
to be quoted. One was that the heads of
the coal companies accorded the miners'
representatives a full and patient hearing
end the other that nothing was accom
plished save that they were told that they
could come again at any time and be
heard without any stipulations being
made as to the capacity in which they
might come.
Senator Hanna said he had been await
ing a report from the sub-committee of
the conciliation committee, but that
Mitchell's statement had anticipated it.
The work of the conciliation committee
was ended, said the Senator, when it
brought together the operators and the
representatives of the miners' union and
he added that noting more could be done
unless there were some new develop
ments. â¢
HANNA IE. WAITING.
Senator Harm a. said he was officially
notified to-day by Ralph M. Easley, sec
retary Of the National Civic Federation,
of the statement issued last night by
President Mitchell In New York. He im
tnediately wired Mr. Easley instructing
him to refrain from calling another meet
ing of the conciliation committeee as that
procedure would be useless in view of the
latest developments.
PHILADELPHIA, May 4.â Senator Han
na in an interview to-day characterizes
the situation in the anthracite coal region

the United Mine Workers for three an
thracite districts called for next Wednes
day at Scranton, Pa., by National Presi
dent John Mitchell.
Notice has been sent to members of this

WASHINGTON, May 4.-In pursuance
of the resolution adopted by the House
yesterday, public memorial services were
held over the remains of the late Rep
resentative Amos J. Cummings of New
York in the Hall of . Representatives this
afternoon. Only twice before in recent
years has such an unusual honor been
paid to a deceased Representative, those
occasions being the state funerals of
Representative William D. Kelley of
Pennsylvania and Representative Nelson
Dingleyof Maine. The exercises to-day
were, very impressive. Almost the en

inade<ruate to hold the thousands who
went to the Capitol seeking admission.
Delegations from the Department of New-
York, G. A. R.; New York Typographical
Union No. 6, the New York Pilots' As
sociation and various letter carriers as
sociations were in attendance.
The floral tributes were numerous and
0Â« the most exquisite character. The
casket was brought into the hall by the
Capitol police, escorted by the. commit
tee appointed by the two houses of Con
gress acting as honorary pallbearers, and
placed on a bier below the Speakers
rostrum. Upon the casket rested large
wreaths of white carnations and PUfPÂ»e
orchids. On either side were immense
floral wreaths of roses and carnations
from the members of the House and the
members of the New York delegation,
and immediately in front was an anchor
of violets from the members of the House
Naval Affairs Committee. There also
were floral tributes from Columbia Typo

request of William Cullen Bryant, pres
ident-of the New York Press Club, Sec

Mrs. Palmer and their two sons, Honore
and Potter Jr., were with Mr. Palmer
when he died. . No arrangements have yet
been made for the funeral, but in all
probability he will be buried in Chicago,
where. he accumulated his fortune.
Palmer's fortune is estimated at
$25,000,000.
CHICAGO. May 4.â Potter Palmer, for
nearly half a century one of Chicago's
most prominent business men, died to
night at his residence on Lake Shore
drivel The exact cause of Mr. Palmer's
death has not yet been determined.- He
had been suffering for several weeks from
a nervous disorder, but as he was able to
be about the house his condition was not
: thought to be serious.
When lie retired last night he was feel
ing, if anything, better than for several
days. During the Â¦ night, however, he
seemed to lose all his energy, and this
morning was -unable to leave his room.
He gradually grew weaker during the
day and at 5:10 o'clock this evening he
suffered a sudden collapse from which he
expired. The physicians who were at
tending Mr. Palmer are at a loss as to
the ultimate cause of his death, as ap
parently he had no organic troubles.
Palmer's condition had not been regard
ed as extremely serious even by the fam
ily physician, Dr. Henry B. Favill. Sat
urday night Palmer suffered from a fever.
His temperature was then 100, and by
this morning was 107, but Dr*. Favill, while
unable to account for the presence of this
fever, did not feel "that it indicated se
rious results.
This afternoon Mrs. Palmer noticed
symptoms of sinking in Mr. Palmer and
became much alarmed. Dr. Favill could
not be found and Dr. George P. Marquis
was called. He reached the Palmer resi
dence at 4 o'clock, and after a brief ex
amina.tion of the patient advised Mrs.
Palmer that he could hold out no hope.
Palmer had seemed to fall into a sleep
at 3 o'clock, although it was fatal uncon
sciousness and so remained until the end.
Dr. Marquis made a vain effort to hold
the wavering spark of life of the patient
by administering oxygen, but it was with
out avail. He could only give the family
the assurance that Palmer was passing
away without pain. There was silence in
the room then until 5:40 o'clock, when the
physician raised his hand and it was
known that death had come.
Just after Mr. Palmer's death, Dr. Fa
vill arrived at the residence. After a
brief conference with Dr. Marquis, he an
nounced that death was due to heart fail
ure. He discovered a slight disorder of
the lungs that gave some indication of in
cipient pneumonia, possibly brought on
by an attack of grip suffered several
months ago, but not sufficient to have
brought the speedy end.
News of the death spread rapidly over
the city, and intimate friends of the Pal
mer family called early at the home. Old
time associates of Mr. Palmer, such as
Judge Lambert Tree, Marshall Field,
Lev! Z. Leiter and Erskine Phelps were
Informed. Robert T. Lincoln, H. H. Kohl
saat and R. W. Patterson called.
It was at first intended by the family
to prepare an official statement as to Mr.
Palmer's death, which should incorpo
rate the views of the attending physi
cians, but this plan was changed, and
Mrs. B. L. Honore gave out such state
ments as were desired. She said that
nothing could have been more of a sur
prise to the family and that she was pos
itive that Mr. Palmer himself had never
realized that death was near..

party at noon, driving to the
Country Club, where golf rules even on
Sunday, stopping at the garden party at
Mitchell's country place, and calling on
Mrs. Charlotte Severance, the aged moth
er of California clubs. ' Mrs. Dennison
started early to see Pasadena and dine
with friends. Mrs. Sarah Platt Decker
went to Santa Monica beach, where 'Mrs.
Cynthia Westover Alden and the Sun

Mrs. Bookwalter took in two receptions,
while almost every visitor went a-pleasur

tally-ho rides, trips up Mount Lowe and
other outing events. Mrs. Robert- Bur

woman who observed the day, and she
attended the service conducted by her dis
tinguished husband. â¢
There was a decided change in the po
litical situation to-day and for the first
time things are really interesting. The
ardent admirers of Mrs. Decker, being,
displeased at Mrs. Dennison's presiding at

BALTIMORE. May 4.â Mayor. Hayes to
day received a letter from George J.
Gould in which he places himself squarely
behind the Fuller syndicate and pledges
the faith of himself, the Wabash. Wheel-
Ing and Lake Erie and West Virginia Cen
tral mines to perform the things the Ful
ler syndicate has promised the people of
Baltimore, and which constitute the
grounds upon which they ask acceptance
of their bid for the city's interest in the
Western Maryland Railroad. The latter,
it is believed, will remove all objection to
the Fuller sale ordinance and It Is ex-,
pected that the second branch of the City
Council will pass the ordinance to-mor
row. It has already passed the first
branch. In his letter Gould says:
"Neither I nor my associated interests
have had any part in any purchases or
accumulations of Reading stock, and the
newspaper reports referred to are wholly
erroneous. My own attitude and that of
the Wabash company to the proposed
purchase of the Western Maryland Rail
road is as stated by Mr. Ramsey, Colonel
Herrlck and Mr. Price, namely, that the
road Is desired, if it can be bought at the
price proposed, in order that it may be
used as an outlet, with sea terminal at
Ba-. more, of the American Steam Packet
Company, and the North German Lloyd
line has been generally interpreted as ad
vantageous to the German lines, insuring
fair and regular earnings in the years to
come. The speculative element, however,
wholly ignores the agreement between the
German lines and the shipping combine
as a factor in the situation, and is in
clined to distrust the compact with the
Americans. \ fe : .Â¦:â¢, /: :tV.

NEW YORK, May 4.â Over 400 kosher
butchers, members of the craft, met to
day to consider the high prices of meats.
A proposition received with much favor
was to close the butcher shops entirely
during the prevalence of high prices. An
other equally well received proposition
was to establish one"' store in each block
and to have the butchers from other
stores work together. It was finally de
cided to place the matter in the hands of
a committee of thirty, to report at a
meeting to-morrow. The committee was
instructed to communicate with the Al
lied Butchers' Association of Greater
TCew York and endeavor to have them
send representatives to the meeting.
It was said at to-day's meeting that the
average sales of the kosher butchers in
ordinary times were 600,000 pounds a week,
but that at present the sales are barely

It is altogether probable that Judge Day
will also go to that city to continue as
special counsel for the Government in the
case against the trust. The Government
is proceeding with unusual care and mak
ing sure of its ground at every step. It
was said to-night that District Attorney
Bethea had left Chicago for Washington
and New York in connection with the beef
trust suit, but it can b& stated on author
ity that he has only gone for a day or
two to meet some engagement and will re
turn to his office to-morrow.
Appreciating the importance of quick
and decisive action, it was deemed best
to lose no time *and hold a preliminary
consultation on the bill, notwithstanding
the fact that it was Sunday. This was
the first meeting of the Attorney General
and Judge Day since the latter's return
from Chicago last night.
The bill, which was drawn in Chicago by
District Attorney Bethea and Day, was
laid before Knox and it was considered in
detail for some time. To-morrow it will
be considered by the President. The At
torney General approved all that has been
done bv the officers of the department in
Chicago. He may decide to make some
verbal changes In the bill, as it is to be
filed in his name, but the document in
general meets his views and is also
thought to conform in all its details to the
wishes of the President. When the final
revision is made it will be sent to Chicago
and tiled at' once.

WASHINGTON, May 4.â Attorney Gen
eral Knox had a long conference to-day
with former Judge William A. Day, over
the Government's legal proceedings
against the beef trust, thus setting at rest
all rumors that there was to be delay In
the filing of the bill fcr an injunction.

This is a conservative diagnosis of three
desperate cases in the United States Sen
ate, the bills which must be passed before
the Republican party can go to the coun
try in the. general elections next- fall with
any hope of success. The situation has
brought alarm to President Roosevelt.
and from his warning and an unmistak- x
able hint that it is time for the Republi
can Senators to get together and do some
thing for the party and Administration,
it has brought back to town Senator Aid
rich in somewhat of a panic.
The majority party in the Sen
ate is in quite as bad a way
as the Henderson - Payne - Grosvenor
combination in the House. -This is
due. not so much to bad manage
ment, as. to lack of management, added
to the very aggressive and at times clev
er opposition. Nothing but a very stren
uous and heroic application of electricity
from the White House can bring Cuban
reciprocity back to -life.
The canal situation is now giving the
Administration almost as . much
alarm as Cuban reciprocity, for
it knows full well that' the peo
ple of this country demand the canal
and at once. They know, that the Hep
burn bill means a canal, while pressure
in behalf of the Panama route only means
delay and possibly defeat for any Ameri
can waterway. In this matter the major
ity in the Senate is at the mercy of the
Democrats, for the vote on the canal de
pends entirely on the time when the vote
is allowed by the minority on the Philip
pine bill. While â¢ the Democrats are in
favor of the Nicarague canal, they would
be glad of an adjournment without a
vote, for they know It would put the Re
publicans at a great disadvantage in the
elections. - .

WASHINGTON, May 4.â Senator Mc-
Laurin of South Carolina has Issued an
appeal to the people of his State, In which
he recites the history of the breach be
tween himself and his party associate,
growing out of his attitude on the tariff
and Spanish war questions. He continues:
â¢^.ast summer, recognizing my responsi
bility to the people, there being no cam
paign In the State, I announced my in
tention of going before them for the purÂ»
pose of discussing these national Issues.
1 was immediately and violently assailed
for advocating Republican doctrines and
branded as a Republican in Democratic
disguise. The State Democratic Execu
tive Committee met, and at the dictation
of my colleague in the Senate formally
declared that I was not a Democrat,
which formed the basis for similar action
on the part of the Democratic caucus of
the United States Senate. Since that time
the war against me has been persistently
waged. The policy of my opponents haa
been to belittle the real issues into a per
sonal quarrel between Tillman and Mc-
Laurin.' This issue I am not willing to
accept, as I do not propose to be influ
enced in may public course by personal
spleen or petty jealousy.
"Now the proposition of my political
enemies is to exclude me from the pri
maries as a candidate and to exclude all
candidates for office who entertain my
views and thus prevent the people from
hearing me and from, hearing â¢ them^ In
justification of my course and in advo
cacy of the absorbing public measures
now confronting the American people. I
am absolutely convinced and forewarned
of this purpose to exclude me and my
friends, because I have read the speech
of Senator Tillman, acknowledged dicta
tor of the Democratic machine of South
Carolina, delivered at Manning, in which
he directs a revision of the rules and form
of oath of the party for the purpose of
excluding myself and friends from par
ticipation in the primary.
"It is a matter of no concern - to ma
what may be the action of the May con
vention as to the rules of the primary
and a revision of its pledges. The sup
pression of free speech and independenca
of . action in voting by such means ren
ders it impossible for any self-respecting
citizen holding my views to become a
candidate in the Democratic primary In
South Carolina. I realize that many of
my loyal friends would even once ' more
hold In check their resolution not to again
enter our system of primary elections in
order to again vote for me, but I have
reached the point where I will not subject
them to subscribing to an oath to sup
port men and measures which do not rep
resent their views upon the issues facing
the American people to-day." Â£f39[

A SIMPLE QDESTil
San Francisco People Are Requested
to Honestly Answer This.
Is not the word of a representative cit-
izen of San Francisco more convincing
than the doubtful utterances of people
living everywhere else in the Union?
Read this:
Mauris Kuttner of the Eastern Pleat-
ing Co., 131 Post street, residence W)S
Geary street, the proprietor of the only
establishment of its kind west of Chicago,
says: "For twelve years attacks of back-
ache were either coming on mysteriously
or leaving just as mysteriously, caus-
ing more Buffering than the ordinary man
Is entitled to endure. When in this con-
dition I sent East for remedies, tried
plasters and ordinary makeshifts, but I
never obtained any permanent result. I
honestly think after the use of Doan's
Kidney Pills for three days I felt better,
at all events, a continuation of the treat-
ment stopped the last attack. I have
more than once intended to write the
manufacturers of Doan's Kidney Pills
and tell them about the benefits I receiv-
ed. l\o one In San Francisco at all trou-
bled with backache need be the least
dubious about going to the No Percentage

pended upon to do Its work thoroughly."

It la stated upon reliable authority ' that
Governor Gage endeavored to inject himself
Into the strike situation In San Francisco last
week, hla effort being a complete failure,
neither side seemingly being willing: to have
anything to do with the Governor, and his ap
pearance being viewed as an unwarranted in
trusion of a mere politician seeking to make
political capital.
It is stated that when the strike was at Its
highest tension and settlement seemed problem
atical, the Governor made his appearance in
the metropolis very early one morning unex
pectedly and unheralded, and registered at a
prominent hotel. Soon after his arrival In ths
city he sent word to the parties to the strtka
apprising them that he was in the city and
tendered his services with a view to a settle
ment of the strike and Intimated that he was
willing to serve in any capacity, and that If
his services were desired, he would devote his
entire energies to tho matter and seek for an
adjustment or settlement of the differences ex
isting between the United Railroads and thÂ»
striking carmen. The Governor's message waa
rent to both parties to the strike. In a short
time an answer was returned to the Governor
which caused him to l&ve for Sacramento a'
once. Tho reply was elegantly phrased but
none the less pointed. The Governor was told
that his good intentions were appreciated that
his services were not required and that "Ma
presence if. anything, was a source of irrita
tion." It Is not to bÂ« wondered at that after
receiving such- a rejoinder the Governor re

Once when Moses was away" from the camp for
forty days Aaron got the Israelites to bring him their
golden ornaments, and out , of them he fashioned a
golden calf and said to the people, "These.: be thy
gods, O Israel." . While the people were worship
ing the calf Moses came down from the mountain
and in a blaze of wrath invoked a direful punishment
upon the idolators, whereupon the eloquent J Aaron
promptly went over to the winning, side^ laid the
blame ; on the people â¢ and got off scot free. , Doubt
less the new Aaron is capable of playing the ; same
game, and will be quick to play - it whenever an' op
portunity occurs. Very easy will it be for the- much
talking one to shift the blame whenever he has set
the camp to worshiping false; gods. As an Aaron,
therefore, Bryan may be more successful than as a
Moses, - but he will continue . to be . about' as nurtful
to his party and to* the; politics of the country. '
COLONEL WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN
of Nebraska, accompanied by Governor Wil
liam S. Jennings of Florida, has been over,
to Alabama to attend a "Bimetallic Banquet"
at Birmingham., The reports of the- event are- silent
as to. the menu and to the kind of bimetallism that
is still, being fed and feasted in that neck of the
woods; they inform the world that the 'Colonel "in
timated" he would not again be a candidate for the
Presidency. He told the feasters he is quite willing
to have some other man undertake the role of Moses
to lead the . bimetallists 'out of the wilderness and
across the deserts, and for himself asks no more than
the. role of Aaron. Now it will be remembered that
Aaron was an eloquent man who did the talking
while Moses did the work, and that at,times he got
Mbses and the children of Israel into a great deal of
trouble. , ~ . ,
As a, rule the Aaron of old was content to speak
the things that Moses told him to /speak, -but Mr.
Bryan is not that kind of an Aaron. In a recent
issue of the Commoner he exhorted, the Democrats
to beware of reorganizers and to permit no gold man
who bolted the Chicago platform ; to be a candidate
for any; office on the Democratic ticket. Thus the
new Aaron assumes to himself the right of saying
whom the"new Moses shall be and what the new
Moses shall teach and practice. Â¦'Â¦Â¦'-Â¦Â¦Â¦>Â¦
BRYAN AS AN AARON.
.That: the reception given to the delegation;, ap
pointed by President 7 Loubet to represent France
So far as official rank, public service and personal
merit go the chief of the French delegation is far
superior to Henry, for while Henry is -hardly any
thing more than ' the brother, of the German Em
peror, the French delegation is to be headed by the
Commander in Chief of the armies of France, an
officer 'who has rendered important- service to his
country and has risen to his high position by per
sonal merit. Moreover, while Henry came here
merely to launch^ a pleasure yacht, the Frenchmen
come in response r to an invitation to^ take: part in a
great state ceremonial.
The discussion was not important, but at the time
it was interesting and some of the interest still sur
vives. It seemed as if there would never be any way
of deciding which of the contending parties - was
right, but now an opportunity for reaching a de
cision, is offered us. We are to have a test case on
a large scale. President Loubet, in response to an
official invitation from Congress and the President
of the United States, is to send to this country a
representative of France to attend the ceremony of
unveiling at Washington a bronze statue of Count
de Rochambeau, which has been erected to com
memorate the aid given by France to the American
colonies at the time of the war for independence.
When the representatives arrive they will be in the
fullest sense the ; guests of the nation, and\by noting
how much of a, reception is given to them we shall
be able to arrive at affair estimate of how much of
the fervor shown for Henry was ,due to the fact that
he represented royalty as well as Germany.-
WHEN Prince Henry was in this country
there was z somewhat heated (discussion
concerning the motives of the immense
crowds that followed him and occasionally carried
hospitality to the limit of extravagance. It was as
serted on the one side that the spirit that dominated
most of 'the thousands who wrangled for precedence
at the receptions was that of an obsequious rever
ence for royalty, that the words of welcome were
tainted with adulation, and that the whole thing was
a display of a courtier feeling unworthy of America.
On the other side it was asserted that the motives
were patriotic and commendable; the spirit that of a
genuine American hospitality showing respect for
the representative of a great and friendly nation.
Henry's royalty, it was said, had nothing to do with
the matter. He was welcomed solely as the repre
sentative of Germany.
We do not see where Governor Gage is going
to make any hay in the carmen's strike. There
has not been a place anywhere as yet for him
to swing his scythe In. Mayor Schmitz is the
chief mower so far. It was a thoughtful stroke
on his part to set the place of conference at his
office. But it was exalted wisdom for him to
advise the strikers to go to the struck, when
the latter refused to meet the former on neutral
ground. In fact, the Mayor's office has not
shone with greater luster In very many years
through a municipal ruction than It is shining
at this very time.

*A TEST OASE.
.Philadelphia is reputed to be a slow city, but the
Charleston people say ,she has made a bigger record

expected she will get her reward in the form of a lot
of trade that has hitherto been something like a
monopoly for; New York. (
our products, and if it continues during the coming
year we shall move our now-promised large crops
with no difficulty and furthermore Â¦Â¦ at satisfactory
prices. This outlook renders the whole State cheer
ful and sanguine, encourages newcomers to settle
down among us and acts as a fine tonic for general
trade. Taken as a whole this is one of the most
cheering and brilliant springs that the State has ever
experienced.
Here in California the flattering indications, pre
viously mentioned, still prevail. The crop prospects
could not be better, the outlook for fruit being espe
cially brilliant as far* as the size of the crop is con
cerned. An encouraging sign is the continued de
mand for farm products for all sorts of consumptive
points, extending from Europe ] to Asia, from the
West Coast to Alaska, from the central parts of the
United States to Australia, and so on! As far as
farm produce is concerned the Pacific Coast seems
to be like a great wheel, with spokes radiating in all
directions. There never has been such a demand. for
There was some excitement in Wall street at the
close of the week, occasioned by a temporary tight
ness of money, which caught some ambitious opera
tors napping and gave them a cautionary pinch to
remind them that care is necessary in Wall' street
operations, even in the best of times. The "general
list, however, was not materially affected beyond the
usual sympathetic swell and relapse whenever any
group, even of a minor class, gets caught by the
machinery belting and whirled around a few times.
The country's bank clearings continue to*show a
decrease from those of last year, the loss last week
being 15.3 per cent, though the aggregate clearings
were very large, exceeding $2,500,000,000, these fig
ures showing an immense volume of trade. About
half of the big cities, including New York and Bos
ton, exhibited a loss. The failures were 225, against
226 for. the corresponding week in 1901. There was
nothing particularly interesting in the great staples.
Iron and steel continued in active demand, structural
material in particular, though' a continued loss of 9.2
per cent in Pittsburg's bank clearings would indicate
a corresponding diminution in the trade at that cen
ter. Wool is quoted <Iull and weak at Eastern points,
owing to a decrease in the demand and labor trou
bles; but the New England boot and shoe factories
report a better feeling and more activity in their line,
with larger shipments, and increasing exports of
leather. Exports of wheat and flour from the coun
try at large during the week were liberal, but the
wheat market was unsettled, owing to the variable
weather. The crop is looking well everywhere ex
cept in Kansas and parts of Nebraska and Oklahoma,
and the railroads are expecting a good business
therefrom in the fall. They are doing very well even
now, as their earnings in April were 7.2 per cent
larger than in the same month last year.
GENERAL trade exhibited few new features
last week. More seasonable weather has
stimulated jobbing and retail distribution of
merchandise in most sections of the country, though
the conditions are not flattering in Kansas, Nebraska
and the Southwest, where prolonged dry weather and
dust storms have damaged the wheat crop and dis
couraged the farmer and merchant. The Northwest,
on the contrary, reports too much rain for operations
in spring wheat. All other parts of the country,
however, are sending in favorable reports, and the
general condition of business continues satisfactory.
Should the drought in the Southwest continue a few
weeks longer we may see a repetition of last year's
conditions, when the whole country from Nebraska
to Texas, inclusive, had to draw otj the Pacific Coast
and other favored sections for all sorts of produce,
from barley, oats, beans and potatoes, down to the
most perishable midsummer vegetables. It 'was in
â¢consequence a great year for the California farmer,
but death to his unfortunate brother in the South
west, which was the lamentable part of it.
BUSINESS LOOKS ROSY.
Under the provisions of the act municipal
ownership would go a-glimmering until it was
repealed. Corporate Influence will favor the
amendment and as it is not in the Interest of
the great body of producers of raw materials
in this State they should make it their business
to get a copy of the act, study it wall and sea
that it is killed so dead that it will never
bob up again.
It provides for five high-salaried commis
sioners, who are to have the power to appoint
and fix the salaries of subordinates, and may
travel at public expense as often as they
please, holding sessions in any town that suits
their convenience, and It also provides more
work than they could accomplish if they had
the â¢ wisdom of Solomon and the powers of

around.
Assembly constitutional amendment No. 23
is one of those vicious pieces of legislation
which Governor Gage signed without reflecting
any credit upon himself. It bears tho ear
marks of the corporation lawyer that have be
come altogether too numerous in the Stata

late at night at the tail end of the session,
and members, who voted for 'it unwittingly re
gret their haste and want to see it defeated.

"Political Code, section 1 259.â Every article,
statement, or editorial, contained in any news
paper or other printed publication, printed or
published- in this State, which by writing or
printing tends to blacken the memory of Â«ne
who Is dead, or to impeach the honesty, integ

thereby expose him or her to public hatred,

of any newspaper or other printed publication,

publish any such article, statement or edito

of the requirements of this section. â¢ *
It was understood at the time that this law
was conceived, passed and approved to humil
iate newspaper writers and publishers, and to
subject them to vexatious criminal prosecutions.
If nothing more. Every one of our exchanges,
of every shade of political opinion, severely con
demned this law as without precedent Â»nany
State in the Union, as revengeful legislation
and unworthy of men intrusted with fatate
E It/enactment was probably caused by reason
of rasping criticisms of his ama2ing E* 06 "?""
cy's public acts and a few of the vulnerable
members of the Legislature, by the Los An
gc-les Times and Chronicle. Admitting as a
mere matter of . form that, those papers were
unnecessarily perhaps unjustly, harsh on tne
alleged statesmen, the law hit every newspaper
and magazine and writer for them in the State,
many of whom were positively or inclined to be
friendly to Governor Gage with all his short
comings of temper and Judgment; In other
words disposed to do their best to find some
sort of excuses, if not Justifications, for. the
public acts of one they had mistakenly but in
good faith assisted to elect Governor.
For a few months after the law took ef
fect many newspapers conformed to Its absurd
provisions, but many did not even lor one is
sue and among the latter the Pomona Times.
Soon all ceased to respect or observe it.
For nearly two years the law has been vio
lated by nearly every newspaper in the State
and In about every, issue. ".â '
Soon after its passage some of the big dallies
violated it so as to Invite or provoke prosecu
tion by some of the misfit statesmen who con
ceived, passed and approved It, and In but one
lnttanca that we remember was there an at
tempt at prosecution, and that proved a flat
failure. But until it is judicially declared In
valid, it is a law â a criminal law. It makes
more or less of the newspaper writers uncon
victcd. criminals nearly as often as their mat
ter is published.
. And yet there are newspaper writers in Cali
fornia pleading for Gage's renomination. the re
nomination of one who says by his official acts
that they should be daily or weekly, as the
case may be, prosecuted as criminals under the
informer system, the most detested of all sys
tems of prosecution.
How any newspaper proprietor or writer can
support Gage for re-election passes our com
prehension; and how. any one of them does who
possesses - manliness or self-respect is not un
derstandable on any theory of a satisfied con
science or upright selfishness. I Newspaper men
so far as we know them, do not turn the other
cheek when slapped on one,; and yet Governor
Gago has metaphorically, and so far "as: he
could, intentionally slapped them on both, and
continues to slap them from day to day and
yep.i to year on the statute books of California.
: We ask the Gage editors and publishers. In
good faith, what has i reconciled them to Gage
or this law which they continually violate?
It Is exactly the same revengeful, malicious
lav.' they denounced in 1899 and one which age
does not change any more than age makes ' its
authors fit. for public duties, or worthy the re
spect Or support of manly, self-respecting edi
tors and publishers.

The last Legislature during the administra
tion of Governor Budd. under his management
to make "political capital" for himself, cut
Controller Colgan'a estimate of State expenses
for the next two years about a million dollars,
and a deficiency of $800,000 and the high tax
rate of Governor Gage's first year followed.
At the last Legislature Governor Gage scaled
down Controller Colgan's estimates for the gen
eral fund over $1,800,000 for 1901-2 and 1902-3.
and that is why the State tax levy Is low. Tha
State school estimate was not cut a cent, and
for the first time in the State's history iÂ»
greater (nearly 5O per cent) than the general
fund . estimate. Whenever Colgan's estimates
have not been followed there has been a de
ficiency â and that Is what the next Legisla
ture will face next winter. For the year 1002-3
there is to be $1,750,000 (over $1,000,000 lesa
than last year) raised by State tax for the gen
era* fund. It costs in excess of that amount
each year to maintain the State, normal
schools, the Insane asylums, homes for deaf
and dumb and blind and feeble minded, tha
two prisons and pay the claims of institutions
for the care of orphans and half orphans â to
say nothing of the expenses and salaries of
State officers and the commissions. California
will have a low tax levy next fall, but it will
have a booming one next year to make up
for it. â¢'Â»â¢>--,
WATSONVHJuE PAJAB0NIA2T:
It would be folly to say that there was no
effort at San Jose to do politics in the interest
of nearly every candidate for a State office,
either on the part of himself or his friends,
but it was the work of reconnoitering. a spar
ring for position, rather than the shock of con
flict. That section of the press which has her
alded the resolution with reference to Gover
nor Gage and the State administration aa a
sweeping indorsement of his candidacy for re
nomination is simply evidencing its ignor
ance of the forces that controlled the conven
tion. At the same time that it was agreed
to. It was also agreed that all of the other
candidates were to be Invited to address tha
convention, and thus offset any advantage that
might seem to accrue to the Governor.
SAN BERNARDINO STJN:
Party politics, however,' ought hot to' be the deter
mining factor in the question. The three Territories
are as well fitted for statehood as many, of the com
monwealths that are now enjoying such rights.
Neither of them, if admitted, would be the least pop
ulous State in the Union nor the 'least wealthy in
present possessions or richness of resources that
await future development. It has been charged by
some of the opposition papers in the East that the
Territories should "not be admitted because the "ma
jority of their inhabitants are greasers; the white in
habitants, as a rule, sojoumers who have no perma
nent attachment to the Territory." Such statements
show how much ignorance still prevails in the East
concerning Western development. . Congress ought
not to be influenced by misrepresentations of that
kind. The dominant elements of the population in
each of the Territories are now thoroughly American
and are entitled to have their full share of self-gov
ernment and the privilege \ of participating in the
government of the nation.
The Territories have a just claim upon the Repub
lican party for admission to statehood. .'The plat
form adopted by the party at' the Philadelphia con
vention in .1900 declares: "We favor home rule for
and the early admission to statehood of the.Terri
tories of New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma."
The convention of 1896 made a similar declaration,
and the admission of the Territories would therefore
be in accord with the established and declared policy
of the party. . . ... Â¦ . .-
There have been no developments in politics since
1900 to weaken Republican sentiment in the Terri
tories. In fact if the Republicans admit the three
States they will enjoy the prestige of having done so
and the fact will certainly be of advantage to the
party in the first campaign to be made in the new
States. Under such circumstances we know of noth
ing that could give the Democrats anything like a
sure thing in either of the new States unless it be a
blundering opposition to their admission on the part
of men in Congress who are supposed to speak for
the Republican party as a national organization.
We are at a loss to conceive upon what data that
calculation of the political outlook is based. During
the silver campaigns of 1892 and 1896 New Mexico
went Democratic, but in: 1898 and in 1900 it was car
ried by the Republicans by an increasing plurality.
The Republican candidate for Territorial Delegate
to Congress in 1900 received 21,567 votes to 17,857
polled for the Democratic candidate. At the same
election Oklahoma gave a ' Republican candidate for
Delegate 38,253 votes against 33,359 for a- fusion nom
inee. Arizona elected a Democratic Delegate, but
by a majority of only 100b. It would appear there
fore* from the results of the last Congressional elec
tions in the three Territories that Republicans have
something like a sure thing in New Mexico and Ok
yahoma and a good fighting chance to carry Arizona.
REPORTS from Washington- are to the effect
that the bill providing for .the admission of
Arizona; New' Mexico and Oklahoma to state
hood will be taken up this week, but, despite the fact
that it has been favorably reported by the Committee
on Territories, will.; be opposed by a considerable
number of Republicans from the Eastern States,
among whom are some of the' leaders of the party
in the. House. The reason assigned, for the opposi
tion is that "according to the present- state of politi
cal affairs, the. admission of Oklahoma, Arizona and
New Mexico would mean' six Democratic Senators
and at least five. Democratic Representatives."
THE STATEHOOD BILL.
Governor. Hogg, who has laughed enough to grow

make others laugh, and so he 'announces a conviction
that the next .President r of the United States will be

THE sentiment against the renomination of Gage for Governor is growing wider and deeper. Gage himself
is doing more to provoke; discord in the party than all of his supporters can do to allay the bitterness. Hi3
"recent appointments confirm the general impression that he has surrendered the administration of State affairs
to the bosses. Leaders of the party are convinced now that defeat must be the inevitable result of his renom
ination. Advices received by The Call from the southern part of the State are to the effect that the machine
will not be able to win thirty per cent of the delegates south of Tehachapi. In San Francisco the Burns-
Crimmins-Herrin County Committee (on which Gage relies) cuts' no figure whatever. All the indications point to the de
feat of bossism at the primary election inithis city. Many of the political prophets are predicting that Gage's name as a
candidate for Governor, will not be placed before the convention. Influential newspapers of the State thus comment on
the pretensions of the Governor: â¢ .
SAN DIEGO UNION:
The executive" body of the Republican State
Committee did quite right in directing that the
call for the J convention shall recommend that
delegates be chosen by. open primaries even in
those places where this method of selection Is
not compulsory, under the law. Still, Republi
cans who do not wish 1 to witness the triumph
of the Gage gang must not place too much con
fidence in this recommendation. It will be disre
garded in â¢ many places unless opponents of the
Governor's ring are on the alert and prepared
to do hard work.
It has become quite manifest during the past
few weekb that the Republicans of the State
at large. would regard the renominatlon of Gov
ernor Gage as a calamity. Â¦ From one end of
California to the other are heard murmurings
tagalnet the rule of the. bosses. The only ques
tion now is will the disorganized opposition to
the plan to cram Gage down the party's throat
be able to defeat' the schemes of the Etrons
machine which the Governor, with the aid of
Burns,' Herrln,' Lynch and others of that ilk,
has established for the express purpose of forc
ing upon loyal Â¦ Republicans the alternative of
voting for a man who has disgraced the guber
natorial orflce, or allowing a Democrat to be
come the State's executive? -
If the contemplated outrage upon the party
is to be averted, it will not do to rely too much
upon the recommendation for the open primary.
In those places where it is not compulsory by
law, honest Republicans i must see that it u
the method selected to choose delegates, and
when this point is gained every Republican who
does not wish his party to go down to disgrace
ful defeat must make It his business to see
that. the primary carries out the wishes of the
decent rank and file, and ovei turns the schemes
of the rine. . ' : . â¢
incompetent creatures of his own, who could
and would "do politics" at the. behest of him
self and the political machine upon which ha
Ih relying to secure a re-election. Thus the
public interests were sacrificed and the public
ironey recklessly expended to advance Mr.
Gage's personal ambitions and to intrench the
Burns-Gage administration more thoroughly In
power.
â¢ "â¢ â¢
It was a costly affair, this useless and in
competent Code Commission. After working
tor many months (at the public expense) these
bunglers submitted their work to the Legisla
ture. If it had received proper scrutiny in
that body, it would never have been accepted.
But the Gage-Burns machine Influence was
strong enough In the Legislature to prevent a
due and proper scrutiny of the work. It was
railroaded tnrough. and went to the Governor.
Here, again, it should have .met with a check.
Surely, Governor Gage is a competent enough
lawyer to have discovered, upon even a casual
inspection, that the work of the Code Com
mission was not in accord with the simple re
quirements and limitations of the State con
stitution. In giving his official sanction to thl3
bungling work. Governor Gage evidently hoped
that it would "pass muster" without the Su
preme Court's discovering its weakness and
unconstltutlonality. To assume that Governor
Gage did not perceive its defects is to set him
down as a lawyer of even less than mediocre
ability.
As we know, the Supreme Court made short
shrift ol the Cede Commission's Job of patch
work when it reached that body. Almost at
its beginning the measure was found to be
directly and egreglously vlolative of constitu
tional requirements. So this laborious and
costly work went for naught,' or practically so.
Large sums of the people's money were thus
literally thrown away in tinkering the Ctvll
Code. If competent lawyers " had been placed
on the Code Commission, the work would have
been properly completed, in a much shorter
time, and at less expense to the State. In
stead of being subjected to heavy financial- loss,
the State would in that case have been the
gainer, for it would have had â what it was
entitled to for the expenditure â an authorita
tive, convenient and constitutional codification
of its civil laws.
The appointment of incompetents to the re
sponsible positions of Code Commissioners Is
only one among Governor Gage's many serioua
and costly blunders.. There have been others
In plenty. Before the close of the State cam
paign the Times will find occasion to speak tha
plain truth about some of these other expen
sive mistakes of our machine-surrounded execu
tive.
â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢
i Why has the Governor used the appointive
power at his disposal to so unworthy a pur
pose? The answer is as simple as it is ob
vious. He has placed unworthy persons in
places of trust and responsibility, in order that
he may use them to manipulate the political
machinery of the State, His evident purpose is
to intrench himself In the office of chief execu
tive and to override the popular . will. The
people will not approve such methods when
they are known and understood.
The plans of Governor Gage to perpetuate
his official power and to force upon the Re
publican party his nomination for a second
term are not likely to meet with fruition. His
evident purpose is to make of the Republican
party of California a political machine to be
controlled by himself and operated by his satel
lites. Citizens who still believe in independence
and the rights of manhood very naturally re
volt against such methods. They will make
their objections known and felt at the proper
time. The great body of Republicans are still
adherents of the old-fashioned dictum that men
whom the people choose for office, under a free
government, are servants of the people and
should be content to serve aa such without
aspiring to be masters.
The objections to the renomination of Henry
T. GageÂ«for Governor of California are not oi
a vague, general and Indeterminate character.
They are. on the contrary, "specific, definable
and unmistakable."
TXTLARE BEGISTEB:
Topics does not often yield to the temptation
to say bad words, at least not publicly, but he
will venture on this occasion to remark that
the Gage party push Is hell on harmony. They
are as harmonious as so many purring- cats on
a shed roof in the moonlight. Their benevolent
and unruffled mien is positively touching, but
unfortunately they are not disposed to concede
In the interests of harmony anything more im
portant than plenty of honeyed conversation.
They understand perfectly well that the atti
tude of Governor Henry T. Gage toward the
candidacy of Daniel M. Burns for the United
States Senate outraged the consciences of tens
of thousands of earnest Republicans throughout
the State and that there is positively nothing
In the way of the most perfect harmony in the
party except the effort making to force the re
nomination of Mr. Gage for Governor in spite
of the protests of these very earnest and consci
entious Republicans. If they so much desire
harmony in the party, a thing fundamentally
necessary and Intrinsically desirable from all
points of view, the gentlemen who compose
the Gage push have only to abandon his can
didacy and there will be party harmony to
throw at the birds. It is unwise and even
dangerous for any political party to nominate
for any office any man against whose candidacy
there Is any considerable measure of deep
seated opposition. People are going to vote
very free this year.
a missive would mean hla ruin. The Governor
13 believed. In the quarter referred to, to havÂ»
a method in his madness. It is intimated he
will go ahead worrying his enemie3 for tna
pure love of the thing, until he shall have the
race clear to himself. Then the Governor may
suddenly turn on his foes and decline a re
nomination.
Sentiment Against His Renomination Is Growing Wider
and DeeperâComment of Republican Newspapers.
GAGE'S G0NDUGT PROVOKES
DISCORD IN PARTY RANKS
Therefore, at this season of contrast between East
and West, let Northern California improve her op
portunity. Don't crowd the bargain counter with
"drives," as Mr. Wanamaker says, but so present
our advantages that it will soon be crowded with
buyers, who not seeing what they want will ask for it.
Let it not be forgotten that one Eastern man well
located here, prosperous and content, treated hon
estly by us, is good for a score more like him to
whom he will be guide, philosopher and friend, in
their relocation in the midst of us. Given twenty
such settlers in every county from Kern to Siskiyou
this year, and there will follow a steady stream of
immigration from the localities thej^eave to come
to us. The history of Southern California illustrates
this. Its quick and enormous increase in population,
its sudden transformation from a Mexican commu
nity to the highest expression of American life and
energy, came about by the efforts of immigrants
themselves. Every one that settled there was pleased,
and this pleasure went back East in letters, news
papers, and finally in literature, until now there is
no possible' influence that could at all affect the great
future of that section unfavorably. It all began with
making content and comfortable the first comers.
The promoters of the. settlement of Northern Cali
fornia will find their mostbeneficial activity in pre
senting truthfully, as they will, the capacities of our
soil, expressed in terms that Eastern men can under
stand, the profitable variety that it produces, the re
sults of its tillage in illustrative instances, and above
all the clemency of climate which, takes- out of life
much of the cost and care that are amongst its bur
dens in the East. All this 'done, the Eastern visitor
may want to buy and locate and he will assume the
character of a customer for land. Then let it be sure
that he is treated honestly. We want no more hard
pan cheats like that which ruined the honest Hol
landers near Merced.
But there is also an intensely practical side to the
California situation. It implies economic conditions
vastly superior, in the certainty of results, to any
thing the East can offer. The new policy of the rail
roads, by which Eastern people are introduced here
on rates that induce them to come, is inaugurated
fortunately at the time of greatest contrast. When
they come, let us remind enterprising people, it is
not wise. to overwhelm them with offers to sell some
thing to them. What California needs is such an
exposition of her actual physical and economic con
ditions as will make newcomers want to buy. There
is all the difference in the world between the two
things. If we present the appearance of a country
where everybody wants to sell out, they may easily
suspect that there is something the matter that is not
visible on the surface. It is quite easy for a few score
enterprising real estate agents to make it appear that
the State is for sale, and in every contact with new
comers this appearance should be guarded against,
for it is not the right appearance.
Upon this background is thrown, as upon a screen,
California felix, from north to south and ocean
beach to mountain summit, a picture of vernal
beauty, with every splendid and delicate feature that
foliage and flower, soil arid sunshine, lichen-painted
rock and roaring waterfall can give. Over it all an
air as soft as any that kissed the cheek of Lalla
Rookh in the vale of Cashmere, or soothed the re
pose of Nourmahal at Agra.
BY reports of the weather service and the news
papers, the Eastern spring is a month behind:
The month of March is two months long. Un
seasonable drought has been alternated with unsea
sonable heat, and thai, in 'the same locality, imme
diately followed by freezing weather and flying snow.
Livestock in the region immediately west of the Mis
souri River has suffered severely from these condi
tions, and the losses have been heavy. Farm work
lags, and the fruit crop is having its bloom deferred

reach of the usual mid-May frost which kills all late
blossoms, but rarely injures the fruit that has already

it be after the nomination? The cold shot will
be heated red hot to Sre into the Republican
camp with a chuckling that they have secured
a candidate for a second term easy to 'defeat,
or at least feel encouraged to think so. What
Gage has done to please the Domocrats we have
not been able to discover, hence it must be a
belief on their part that els choice would be
a gain for them. . ,
ST. HELENA STAB:
Gage has a large number of the leadine doII
ticlans of the State with him. and what is
known as the political machinery of the State
which Includes State office-holders at Sacra
mento. San Francisco and elsewhere, will be
with him to the end. There are a large num
ber of Republican papers throughout the State
against Gage. These include The Call, Chron
icle and Los Angeles Times. : Some . of the pa
pers are putting themselves in the prospective
position of bolting the Republican ticket or
eating crow during the next campaign it
would appear that the delegates from" San
Francisco. Los Angeles. Sacramento and Santa
Clara will be for Gage. With these Gasre's
managers will be in a position to form com
blnations with candidates for other office--"
which will draw to the Governor delegates froâ¢.'
the doubtful sections of the 8tate. There w I' i
be favorite sons from all over California Â«pÂ»v
ing office and they will not all want the Cnv
ernorship. The friends of these aspirants win
make reciprocal political arrangements with thÂ»
the strongest gubernatorial candidate and thl
result is very likely to be Increased strength fnt
Gage. In fact it is not at all unlikely the
way things are fixed nowadays, that at conven
tlontime it will be so conclusively shown that
Gage has the majority, of the. delegate that
his will be the only. name brought beforÂ» tÂ£
convention. The good old days to! a free-for-all
fight in conventions seem to be at an *n*
The day was when the balloting of deleetw
decided the fat* of aspirants for office Â£Â«~
it is done by political management and mantoiT
lation. ' Â¦ ' . Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ " .

LOS ANGELES CAPITAL:

of the day's entertainment were dancing
and a concert. A considerable sum .-of
money was realized from the affair which
will/ be used in the benevolent work of the
society. , .
That the outing was so successful was
due mainly to the efforts of the following
named committees:
Movements of Steamers.
the early morning tides are given in the left
hand column and the successive tides of the
day In the order of occurrence as to time; the
fourth time column gives the last tide of the
day. except when there are but three tides, as
sometimes occurs. The heights given are in
addition to the soundings of the United States
Coast Survey charts, except when a minus ( â )
sign precedes the height, and then the number
given is subtracted from thÂ» depth given by
the charts. The plane of reference is the mean
of the lower low waters.
Lays a New Cable.
The tugs Alert and Transit were engaged
yesterday in laying a cable for the Postal
Telegraph Company between Clay-street wharf
and Goat Island, and successfully accomplished
the task by noon. The old cable had been
damaged by the dragging of a ship's anchor
during the recent heavy gale.
Sailor Falls Off Gangplank.
John Turgulni. a sailor on the British ship
Windsor Park, fell off the gangplank yester
day morning as he was attempting to get
aboard the ship. He was sent to the Harbor
Hospital, where Dr. Murphy found that his
back was badly contused, and that he was
considerably cut about the head.
Lucero Goes to Seattle.
The gasoline launch Lucero, which was form
erly owned by Charles L. Fair, is on the Mer
chants' dry dock, being cleaned and repainted.
She will be towed to the Arctic Oil Works
wharf to-day, where changes ordered made in
her machinery will be completed. She will
be fitted out for a trip to Seattle, where her
new owners, the Pacific Packing and' Naviga
tion Company, will use her as a dispatch boat.
Dirigo Is Spoken.
Word was received yesterday at the Mer
chants' Exchange that the American ship Dir
igo. out over three months from Hongkong to
Hilo, had been spoken off the Japan coast on
March 30. Fifteen per cent reinsurance has
been offered on the Dlrigo, but the receipt of
this news, though a long time reaching this
port, has caused a withdrawal of her name
from the list of overdue*.
Big Cargo of Jute.
The British steamer Caithness, .which ar
rived on Friday, docked yesterday at Union
street wharf and will proceed at once to dis
charge her cargo of jute and grain bags. The
jute will be eent to San Quentin. Captain
Clegg says his orders are to go to Puget Sound
for a load of lumber for Buenos Ayres. The
Caithness had an uneventful trip out.

the height of tide is the same at both places.
Perkins has .won the heiress , he met In

thing for ambitious young men to fre
quent secluded summer resorts, where the
very air breathes gentle sentimentality
and one is so close to nature that to fol

the only thing to do. There is something
infectious, too, about the moonlight, and

his surroundings to say just the right
thing at the right time he bids fair to
The Oceanic Steamship Company's steamer
Australia, Captain R. T. Lawless, sailed yes
terday on her last trip to Tahiti. On her re
turn she will be succeeded by the reconstruct
ed Mariposa, which will be one of the finest
passenger steamers sailing from this port. The
Aui-tralia carried five first cabin and seven
second cabin passengers. There were five
whites and fifty-two Chinese in the steerage.
The Australia had a large amount of freight on
board.

The new steam schooner Brooklyn had
her trial trip yesterday, and came up to
the expectations of her owners, Beadle
Bros. With a large party of guests, on
board, the Brooklyn steamed about the
bay for several hours, making an aver
age of a little more than ten knots on
the measured mile course. A return was
made to the wharf, where. a number of
passengers got off. The remainder went
on a trip outside the heads, and the
Brooklyn proved herself a good sea boat.
"I have been twenty years in the ship
ping business on this coast," said George
Beadle on his return, "and that was the
first time I was ever on the ocean."
Mr. Beadle declined to state how he
liked his experience.
The Brooklyn is of 293 gross ton
nage, and has a carrying capacity of
fifty passengers. She was built by Lind

Everybody wondered on the way out of
the church why the Perkins-Huntington
wedding was so solemn. The lavish deco
rations of giant palms, ferns and Easter
lilies were beautiful. The gowns in their
elegance and artistic effect surpassed
anything San Francisco had ever before
seen at a wedding; they were really won
derful. Still the wedding party felt the
solemnity of the occasion to such a de
gree that nobody smiled. Now that Mr.
sweep over- San Francisco, remind
ing us that we must hasten with our
shopping and pack trunks before our
spring hats are all blown to pieces. -The
resorts close by are the first to be sought,
as It is possible for busy men who secure
quarters at these to leave the city at
night to see their families and then hie
themselves back to work again the next
morning. Dr. and Mrs, , James . A. Black
have taken their wonderful V baby and
gone to the Hotel Rafael for a month,
and the doctor will come to the city
every day. Later he will remain in the
city while Baby Black and his mother
take a short trip to the mountains to
escape hot weather.
Mr. and Mrs. Worthington Ames (nea
Preston) will be delightfully situated in
a cottage at San Mateo, and as they will
have many friends about them and Bur
lingame two miles away they are sure to
have a happy summer. San Mateo bids
fair to be more popular' this season 1 than
Burlingame, as many residents of the lat
ter place have closed their homes and
gone East and abroad. The Hotel Mate<j
is falling up rapidly under the new man
agement. Wrenn & Spaulding. have con
verted the grounds into a. veritable-gar
den of Eden, and the cozy cottages
tucked away here and there are beauti
fully equipped. When Mr. Wrenn was at
the Occidental and â¢ California hotels fair
maids and matrons made a great point of
telling their troubles to him, and I have
an idea that his kind solicitude and gen
tle manners have much to do with ins
success in life.

leaving it on the port hand; thence to
Blossom Rock buoy, round which they
gybed; thence to Southampton Shoal buoy;
thence. to and round Presialo Shoal buoy;
thence to finishing line.at Meiggs wharf.

the first run from Presidio Shoal buoy to
Blossom Rock buoy. The Presto, having
a sailing length of twenty-eight feet, re
ceived an . allowance of 6 minutes 50 1-10
seconds from, the Harpoon, the sailing

ond money in the Bench Show champion
stake, with Charta and Luxor. -Charta
won the stake, beating her opponent by a

Each member of the winning crew was
presented with a gold badge by Messrs.
A. P. Rothkopf and F. C. Stalb.
column to-day by defeating the Senators
in a well-contested game, in which hon
ors were even in many particulars.
Schmidt's fast, accurate work in left field
and slow base running on the part of
the Senators contributed to the result.
Both Dowling and Cristall pitched good
ball. Cristall's backing throughout was
far superior to that accorded Dowling.

The Dolphin _ Swimming an-1 Boating
Club held the opening'faces of the rowing'
season on this bay yesterday, over the
North Beach course. The distance was
one mile with a turn, the starting point
being at the foot of Van Ness avenue.
Invitations "had been extended the rela
tives and fair friends of the competing
oarsmen, and the clubhouse veranda was
gay with life and color when the racing
commenced.
- The club's new racing barge was known
to be the faster boat, hence the crews
which rowed in it .were penalized three
lengths. The results showed- this to be
inadequate, as ' the crew which used this
boat won handily each time.

McHale robbed Householder of a sure
two-base hit in the first, and handily dou
bled up Toman, who was at second. An
derson also made a clever catch of a foul
hit to right field. Jones pitched gilt-edged
ball throughout the game. Leahy and
McHale were the only Ponies to act prop
erly, the former doing all the playing.
The score:
The Ponies played like a lot of milliners'
apprentices In the morning game at Oak
land. The Infield was full of holes, Holly
and Reilly being responsible for half the
runs scored. The Angels landed hard on
Kane and he : was generous â¢ with free
transportation to first. In the ninth In
ning, the Southern men secured a three
bagger and two doubles, which netted two
runs.

THE opening cricket match of the
season between the Alameda and
Pacific elevens "^as played yester
day on the ground at Webster
street, Alameda, the Pacific team
winning an exciting gamo by the narrow
margin of seven runs. "'
The Alameda team went to the wickets
first with F. Stahl and Bert Bird, the
former, being bowled for 0 by Casidy. The
latter scored 22, Harold Ward ran up 50,
and G. Croll 20 runs. With the exception
of Richter, who made 12 runs, none of the
team materially increased the total, the
Innings closing for 116 runs. Casidy took
five wickets for 42 runs, and D. Jamieson
captured three wickets for 19 runs.
The Pacific team sent Casidy and Coles
to the bat, Jhe former scoring 38 and the
latter 9 runs. With only two wickets
down for 80 runs the Pacific seemed to
have the watch well in hand, but when
seven wickets had fallen for 107, matters
did not look so well. The last two men,
however, put on a few runs and won .the
match for their, side. The only men who
made double figures for the winners were
Casidy, 38, and A. W.' Wilding, 47. Har
old Ward took five wickets for, 33 runs,
and Croll and Bird captured two apiece.

An unusually large attendance and a
record-breaking number of clean scores
Â¦were the two features especially notice
able at the regular monthly live bird
shoot of the California Wing Shooting
Club yesterday at Ingleside. The cool
weather seemed to be adapted to good
ehooting. In the club event there were
twenty-four entries, and straight scores
Â¦were made by P. J. Walsh. H. William
son, A. C. Golcher. K. Donohoe, M. O.
Feudner, J. J. Sweeney and Dr. E. G.
2icConneIL while there were seven shoot
ers who only missed one bird
P. J. Walsh, who made his appearance
for the second time this season at the
live bird traps, succeeded -in grasslng_
thirty-six pigeons without a miss; in fact,
he did not allow a single one of his birds
to escape during the day. He shot from
the 2S-yard line.
The feature of the day, however, was
the record established by M. O. Feudner.
Â¦who shot from the 32-yard mark. Al
though stationed at this great distance
from the birds he succeeded in making two
Etright scores of fifteen birds each. In ac
complishing this feat he was forced to
tise both barrels on every pigeon released
from the traps.
G. W. Gibson, a new member of the
California Wing Shooting Club, signalized
his first appearance at the Ingleside live
cird traps by killing ten in the club race
and eleven in the twelve-bird pool. This
is considered excellent shooting for a be
ginner. In all the pool contests the same
handicaps were allowed as in the club
shoot.
The scores made in the club shoot were

to second. Raymer stole the middle bag
and arrived with Householder on Reilly's
timely drive to left field, which complet
ed the run getting for the day.
McNichols trotted around with the Po
nies and played a first-class game at sec
ond. He robbed Hanlon of a clean hit
and immediately made good with â¢ the
crowd. Bill Hanlon covered first base
just as of yore and started the run earn
ing for- the Morley crowd.. Nordyke in
terfered with Delmas' throw when To
man was sliding to the plate and It prob
ably cost a run. Some hoodlum threw a
bottle at Charley Reilly. It broke in
pieces near where he was standing. The

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
The element of luck played an impor
tant part in the gallop of the first Pony
to the wire. Mcriale smashed out a
pretty drive to right field, good for two
bases. Holly sent a hot grounder right
at Toman. It took a false bound and
went over the little man's shoulder and
McHale crossed the rubber amid the
howling and cheering of the vast throng.
Things ran smootnly until the fifth,
when Nordyke, Holly and Shugart each
hit out a hot drive and, aided by an error,
two more runs were scored. After that.
Rube allowed no more business to be
transacted, and had the locals completely
at his mercy.
The massive southpaw did not use such
terrific speed as he is capable of pass-
Ing out, but he had the Ponies in a quan
dary and pitched elegant ball. He pitched
good enough to win any game, Dut it
looked baa for the mighty one until the
eighth. Meredith also twirled a magnif
icent game, but the Angels discovered his
weak spot and hammered in live runs in
the fatal eighth with a bewildering dis
play of ''smashing singles and douoles â
the kind that make the blood tingle and
the mouth yearn for a soft drink.
Jim Morley, of baseball fame, who longs
for a pennant with which to decorate the
City of Orange Groves, was in a joyous
frame of mind last night. With the odds
against him that the Ponies would gallop
away from his band and the wise ones
looking with scorn and disdain upon the
Southern club wielders, he got into the
game with both feet- and a thinking box
and broke even on the series. The An
gels were the main squeeze in both bat
tles, winning 6 to 1 at Oakland and 5 to
3 at Recreation Park. Oakland winning
at Sacramento keeps the club across the
bay in the lead for the pennant.
The afternoon, bout was a blood-curdler
and more excitement and commotion was
crowded into the eighth inning than will
be found in thirty-nine rounds of the or
dinary article. More than 10,000 people
were quartered in the stands and bieach
ers, and a few hundred more viewed the
explosions from behind a rope in left Held.
No - one was sorry he came lest it be the
gent with the fog-horn vocal delivery,
who took pleasure in handing Rube a few
bunches so he would not run the Ponies
too hard.

To-night's meeting was turned into a
riotous demonstration against the police.
Three city detectives had been attracted
to the hall by loud cries and cheering.
They went in at a time when McQueen,
editor of a paper, was addressing the
crowd, assailing the Government and de
claring himself an anarchist. By the time
the officers had reached the platform
Most was addressing the. crowd in Ger
man. The detectives placed Â«the two
speakers under arrest. This was the sig
nal for a riotous outbreak. The detectives
had to fight their way to the street with
their prisoners, and the crowd then grew
so threatening that the reserves were
called out After some difficulty, Most,
McQueen and one other man were taken
to the police station and locked up.

down for 51000. Mr. Smith announced
that he would not be outdone by a man
from the far East, and he added his name
to the list for an equal sum.
The Klng'3 Daughters had 52000 added

Greater and more extensive experiments
â¢will be made by these three disciples of
Marconi.
NAPA, May'lANapa has three young
men who have for some time past been
studying wireless telegraphy with marked
success. Loy Perry and Paul Chapman,
two students at the Napa High School,
assisted by Professor L. T. Merwln, have
succeeded in putting the new system of
communication into actual practice. Their
experimenting has been done in the phys
ics and chemistry laboratories at the high
school. Their first attempts resulted in
the transmission of messages or signals
but a foot or so.? Later they were able to
extend the distance to a yard, and now
they can send telegraphic* communication
from one laboratory to the other through
two walls, a distance of thirty feet. In
speaking of their demonstration of wire
less telegraphy Professor Merwin said:
"Our system is of course in a crude
way, similar to that of Marconi. We use
a static machine and condensers as trans
mitters, and our coherer was made In the
'lab.' The coherer is In series, with an
ordinary telegraph sounder, which acts
as a relay for the decoherer â a common
electric bell." .

Routh and Will Geary was won by the
former rather easily. This was somewhat
as a surprise, as the loser played him
very close a week ago. The score,. In
Routh's favor, was &â 3, 6â0. In the finals
it took four sets to settle the question of
supremacy between Allen and Routh. Al
len, who is slighter and much more ac
tive than , his opponent, had the better
staying powers, which enabled him to.
win out in a long match. The first three
sets were exceedingly close, but after this
Routh was distressed, and the remaining
set went to Allen easily. The complete
score was 6â4, 10â8, 3â6, 6â0."-
In the second class the matches were
even closer than in the first. Ed Flnnigan
after having the final match practically
won allowed his opponent to pull up from
fr-1 in the last set and nose him out.
His opponent in this match was Kenneth
Marr, who gave a great exhibition of grit
end proved that a tennis match Is never
won until the last point has been played.
In the third rouna of this class Kenneth
Marr and C. Griffin furnished one of the
best matches of the day. The first set
went to Marr easily, &â 2. In the second
set Griffin barely won out, 8â 6, tend was
bo tired that his opponent took the next.
&-0. Campbell beat Stapff, 6â4, 6â 2. Ed
Flnnigan beat James, .6â 2, 6â 4. J. F.
Brady beat Gould Reading, 6â2, 6â0.
In the semi-finals both matches were
rather short, the victor in each winning
in Straight sets. Marr beat Campbell,
6â4, 6â2, and Finnlgan beat Brady, 6â3,
6â4. The final match, between Marr and
Finnlgan, was highly exciting, arid the
outcome was in doubt until the end; The
score/in favor of Marr, was 6â3, 5â7, 7â5.
The winners, Allen and Marr, will hold
the silver challenge cups for one month,
when they will again be played for. Each
cup must be won three times by one man
before it goes into his possession perma
nently. *
On the California Club courts some in
teresting matches* were- played, the best
of which was the doubles in which Frank
Mitchell and Grant Smith j and Harold
Crowell and William Collier figured. The
former proved too strong for their op
ponents and won two sets out of three.
The score, in favor of Mitchell and Smith,
was 3â 6, 6â 4, 4â1. Worthington and Noble
beat 1 Bull and Daily, 7â 5, 8â 6, 6â3; Kuehn

from being destroyed by fire this after

residing near the school, gave the alarm,
the fire department worked to save the
building, and its efforts were successful.
The fire broke out in the lower story un

It was a "blind" fire and difficult to

The Elks' Street: Fair and Carnival is
rapidly taking shape. The committees
have been meeting. continually during the
week and are able? to 'announce some of
the : plans [ for. , the ; event, j Space is being
rapidly disposed . of to those who .will
make ; and '', the Â¦' success'' of the
event 'is not longer a matter . of question.
I' The fair, will run but eight days.'.'and
th,e ! difficulty now is to supply special days
enough to those who wish to control an
afternoon or an evening, j The Woodmen
of 'the World have' asked for the evening
of Thursday, Juno 19, and this has been
awarded them. On the evening of that
day the Woodmen, of the World of the
entire county will have a grand initia
tion at the Macdonough- Theater. The
drill teams from every camp in the county
will be* present, and In the evening, be
fore the exercises : at the theater, there
will be a competitive drill for prizes at
the fair grounds. After this is over the
work of the order will be given at the
theater. The grounds will be turned over
to tho Woodmen on that evening, a large
drill platform will be erected and search
lights and, colored lights will be used to
increase the effect.
This is the only- exact date that has
been set, but there will be a day set aside
for each of the principal towns of the
county, ; except Oakland. \ There will â¢ be
an afternoon each for Alameda, Berkeley,
Haywards. San Leandro and possibly the
Livermore Valley. The citizens -outside
of the order of Elks will be asked to take
charge of the programme on those days,
and the Elks will secure special railroad
facilities and railroad fares on those days
for the residents who wish to attend.
It ' Is expected that the Interior towns
of Alameda County will make industrial
exhibits as .well as giving a programme
for a day. This is regarded as a very
advantageous opportunity for a display
and a distribution of literature, for many
thousands of visitors are expected from
San Francisco and all over the State.
In addition to the days devoted to the
different towns there will be afternoons
or evenings given over to soetetiesâ the
Native Sons, Odd Fellows, Irish^ocietles
and others. The League of the Cross
Cadets will probably give a drill, and
many features are being added every day.

The stranger, who has been In Tiburon
for several days, entered the saloon of the
Sonoma House and asked Scolarl for a
drink. Scolari told him he had had
enough liquor already. The fellow remon
istrated, asserting that he must have an
other drink. Scolari replied that he must
put up the money first or he could not
have the liquor.
"So you won't give me a drink unless
1 put up the coin. Then take that," and,
drawing a revolver from his hip pocket,
the stranger fired point blank at Scolari's
head. The inaccuracy of the man's aim
saved Scolari's life. The ball grazed his
face and shattered the mirror back of the
bar. Scolari, as soon as the first shot
was fired, dropped behind the bar. His
assailant was climbing upon the bar to
fire again when Constable Al McNeil, who
was in the saloon at the time, grappled
with him ana succeeded in wresting the
A-eapcn from his grasp.
No papers upon the stranger's person
threw any light on his Identity. Sheriff
Taylor was notified and the culprit was
locked up. To-morrow a formal charge
of attempt to murder will be placed
against him.
TIBURON, May 4.â C. Scolari, proprie
tor of the Sonoma House in this city,
r.arrowly escaped being murdered by a
drunken man this evening. The name of
the wculd-be assassin cannot be learned
at this time, for the reason that he will
not divulge it nor reveal his place of res
idence.

up to the standard set by "Tho Serenade"
and so well maintained by "The Fortune
Teller." New, and smart stage furnish
ings and costumes as handsome | as can
be obtained will grace the show, and the
opeia's long rehearsal insures the smooth
ness and finish of its rendering. The
many admirers of Annie Myers will be
glad to welcome her back to prominence
as Greta, the singing girl, a part that will
doubtless be undertaken with delightful
chic by the Tlvoli's clever soubrette.
Hartman will be Prince Pumpernickel,
and the rest of the cast is apportioned to
best advantage. It is the first time "The
Singing Girl" has been given to popular
prices, and it will doubtless prove an ex
cellent attraction.

The chief event of the Alcazar season
will take place to-night with the produc
tion of "When the Heart Was Young,"
the new pastoral drama by Charles
Francis Bryant and Lotta Day Coleman.
The utmost care has been spent upon the
production, and many novel effects in the
way of scenery are promised. It is a pas
toral drama without a villain or the usual
clumsy country louts that are mistakenly
introduced for the sake of atmosphere.
The scenes are laid in New England, the
people are New England types and the
cast has been selected with special pains
from the cleverest members of the Alca
zar forces. The cast Is as follows:
Nat Goodwin and Maxine Elliott will
delight a large audience at the Columbia
Theater to-night in "An American Citi
zen " Madeleine Lucette Ryley's favorite
American comedy. It Is one of Mr. Good
win's most auspicious parts, and most
famous. Miss Elliott also has a charming
opportunity as the very likable heroine,
and her work of the last week makes cer
tain a highly interesting conception. The
piece is possibly the most popular in the
Goodwin repertoire and has been demand
ed with much insistence throughout their
whole tour. That they have decided to
give four performances of the play here
is to be considered a fortunate conces
sion. Monday, Wednesday and Thursday
nights and the Saturday matinee will be
devoted to the play,; the rest of the week
to "When We Were Twenty-One."
This week's list of attractions at the
capacious Chutes Theater Is long and
strong. Among the entertainers are Jack
Norworth, the story-teller; the Clipper
quartet in "Uncle Eph's Dream"; the
Fetching brothers and their musical
flower garden; Gorman and Keppler,
comedian and dancer; Fred Stuber, banjo
virtuoso, and Coley and Mamie Grant, the
"Kohinoors of colored comedy." Colonel
Edward Beaupre. the colossal young man,
who stands nearly eight feet high in his
stockings, is a tall feature. r lhe nrst
amateur performance will be given Thurs
day night.
Seats go on sale this morning for the
big benefit to be given in aid of the new
Actors' Fund Home, announced for next
Thursday afternoon at the Columbia The
ater. That the entertainment will draw
a crowded house there is no doubt, as the
programme to be- offered will be a very
enticing one, of excellent length and di
versity. All the star players now appear
ing in this city will have their quota of
work to offer, and the performance, when
It once gets started, and that will he- at
l;30 sharp, will be full of pleasant sur
prises, as the various playhouses are try
ing to outdo one another in the crteilence
of their respective offerings. N. C. Good
win, Maxme Elliott and their company;
the leading vaudeville acts from the Or
pheum; James Neill and his company;
the Tlvoli Opera-house company; the Al
cazar Theater company; Edward Harri
gan and the Grand Opera-house company;
the Central Theater company. Seats are
to be $2, Jl 50, $1 and 50 cents.
James Neill and his company of play
ers in "Under the Red Robe" form the
strong attraction that holds the boards at
the California this week. Judging from the
sympathetic indorsement tne audience
gave the. first night's production of the
romantic costume drama it is safe to say
that it will have a good run the rest of
tue week. The scenery and costumes are
superb, and this, combined with the ex
cellent quality of the acting, gives the
piece a zest and flavor that is genuinely
enjoyable.
Mr. Neill as Gil de Berault, gambler,
bravo and martyr to his own honor,
makes friends readily for a character
that is generally clothed in serious doubt
until the closing act of the piece. The
part gives Mr. Neill's versatility the
widest possible scope, and he does not
fail to take advantage of every line.
Cardinal Richelieu is played by Frank
Mac Vicars, who originally created the
part. Edythe Chapman added another
cluster to her laurels as Renee de Coche
foret, the loving sister of the Henri de
Cochetoret, a rebel condemned to death
by the Cardinal, and around whose trou
bles the piece is written. Miss Chapman
is the soul of womanly affection and loy
alty in the part
Miss Julia Heinrlch, the charming con
tralto whose name for these two weeks
only may be found upon a vaudeville pro
gramme, leads the interest of the Or
pheum's unusually good bill this week.
Many friends greeted the young singer's
advent Into vaudeville yesterday after
noon, and she received a hearty welcome
at the hands of the Orpheumites.' Miss
Helnrich's fresh, pure voice, was heard
to much advantage in the four songs on
her Drograromeâ "Daphne's Love," "Irish
Foiksong," "Mighty Like a Rose" and
"Guten Abend"â though she seems yet,
not quite at ease in the huge house. Also,
she must miss the delightful accompany
ing of Max Helnrich that was not ade
quately replaced by Mr. Rosner's orches
tra. Doubtless, however, the accom
paniments will go more smoothly to
night. The singer was in excellent voice
and will undoubtedly prove a strong at
traction for the" enterprising management.
The Florenz troupe of acrobats does a
sensational sort of gymnastic stunt. It is
difficult to say just how many there are
of them, but . they are all there. The
troupe includes a wonderful young
tumbler, who turns double somersaults
as easily as one turns a flapjack, and a
strong woman who can give points . to
most men. Milton and Dollie Nobles are
to the fore with a smart new sketch, "A
Blue Grass Widow,", that provides plenty
of amusement, and Hilda Thomas and
Lou Hall have the other sketch, a bright,
well dene comedietta, "The Lone Star."
Raymond and Caverly get plenty of
rather strongly flavored fun out of a Ger
man turn, and the five Nosses and Louise
Dresser continue their successes of last
week. The Hoste brothers do some good
clowning, and with Jack Norworth, who
sings, complete the bill that should find
the Usual size of Orpheum audiences.

OAKLAND, May 4.â The announce
ment is made the return to her
home in this city of Mrs. Beatrice
Priest-Fine after an absence of
several years in the'JSast and in
Europe, where she has been pursuing her
vocal studies under the best teachers.
Mrs. Fine is expected during June, and
she -will make Oakland or San Francisco
her home. Â¦ â¢ Â¦ . <
It is three years since the many friends
or the petite ginger have had the pleasure
of listening to her voiceâ a voice 1 which
the critics of Oakland and San Francisco
said was excellent, and which has proved
to be more than true by her three years'
study in the musical centers of this coun
try and Europe. She was at that time a
member of the choir of the First Metho
dist Church, and had been heard In ama
teur concerts on both sides of : the bay.
Then she went East to .study; and' now
her voice has been pronounced far above"
the average in' tone and quality, and she
returns to her own home with many com
pliments from the best and most severe of
critics. .'-. . '.-'.' :','.:

POSTUM CEREAL.
AN HONEST FRIEND.
Cleared Away the Family Troubles.
There is not one thins on earth that
could enter a family and do as much
honest good and bring: as much happiness
as in certain cases where coffee drinking
i3 left off and Postum Food Coffee used
Jn its place. ':.; ,-}?
A family in Iowa Park, Texas, fur-
nishes a good illustration.: The mother
says: "I want to tell you what happened
in our family when we left off coffee and
took up Postum. About eight months ago
we made a cnange. I had been, for quite
a while, troubled with rheumatism irx ray
right hip and shoulder, swimming of tho
head, and fluttering of the heart, so I
thought I had heart trouble.
"Sometimes in walking my bead would
swim eq that I would be obliged to sit
down. I had other disagreeable feelings
I cannot describe, but they will be readily
understood by coffee drinkers if they will
cenfess it.
"My (family were also more or less 111
and were all coffee drinkers. Well, we
gave up the coffee and started in on Pos-
tum Food Coffee; husband and myself
and four children. Even the 2-year-old
baby (she had been fmny since having
the grip) had her coffee along with the
rest of the family. When we made the
change to Postum she began to fatten
and now is perfectly healthy and fat as
a pig.
"My boys, 10 and 12 j'ears of age, are
eo etout and muscular that people remark
about them and ask what j makes them
bo. I do not have any more trouble with
rheumatism or with my head; neither
does my husband, who was troubled
much in the same way. Wo are all in
better health every way than we have
lx-en before in years and we are always
glad of an opportunity to recommend Pos-
tum. I Â¦ hope what I have said will lead
others to make the change." Name given
by Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.-- j

"The Solar Plexus" was the subject of
a lecture delivered last evening by Miss
; Marie A- Walsh at the Golden Gate Lodge
of the Theosophical Society. The object
of the lecturer was to show that the solar
â¢plexus was the sympathetic center, an4
that consequently it was the root of many
of the disorders that are suffered both
mentally and physically. Miss Walsh in
a raost interesting manner demonstrated
how essential it is to live a life of bright
ness and cheerfulness; how necessary it
Is to conquer depression by opening tho.
windows of the soul that the sun and not
the gloom may enter into one's existence.
."In order to be spiritual," she said, "wa
must shine; we must awaken the light
within the heart. One great mistake is
that people try to be the moon instead of
the sun."

attempt , to secure treasure from the
â¢strong box of J. J. Meyers, a mining ex
pert;' 'at C03 California street, .early yes
terday morning. .After opening. the outer
doors of the office, the burglars drilled
through a' safe : which contained nearly
$30,000 in gold, but were . frightened away

and made their escape in the. darkness.
Â¦ Shortly,- after 7 o'clock yesterday morn

and discovered the, attempt to., rob his
safe. A- hole three-quarters of an Inch in
diameter .had been drilled : through the
iron safe door, and the instrument with
which the work was done was found on
the floor. The. drill was a crude imple
ment;;, such -as is. used by railway*com

larger than is I ordinarily used by safe
crackers. " The police were immediately
notified and Detective Tom Gibson was
detailed on the case. The officer, found
little .that would Â¦ place him on the trail

drill, -he hopes to find some .clew as to
where it was secured.

quainted .with the premises. They had
keys that fitted the outer locks, and dis
turbed; nothing until they started to work

infinite mercy and divine uprightness of
the Lord. Mrs. Snelson. wife of the pas- ,
tor, sang in a very pleasant manner.
"Where Will You Spend Eternity," and

Jesus. Â¦< Â¦-Â¦* :"-.Â¦Â¦ - .
I desire to compliment you on having se
cured such an able minister to occupy your
pulpit, and I want to congratulate him on the
very elocuent sermon which he has delivered
this evening. I desire to say with him that 1
hope that in my administration of the affairs
of this city that I shall be guided by the
divine Christ like Justice of which he spoke.
I shall always extend to the colored people the
fcame consideration that I give to the rest of
my constituents. As your minister has stated,
it is my intention to be the Mayor of all the
people, the bad. as well as the good, the high
as well as tte low and the rich as well as

Education is the only thing which makes
one man. better than another. Under the con

equal so that education is the only possible
means by which one man can elevate himself
over another. Only a few weeks ago our great
President entertained Â¦ one of your people ' at
dinner. Â¦ â¢ *
I came here this evenine more to meet you
and to lend my presence to your .gathering;
than to make an address. I came to show
my appreciation of- the progress which is be
ing- made by a great part of my constituents
â¢which public officials are most prone to for
get. I recognize that the colored people are
making their influence felt in Â¦ public affairs.
Bethel A- M. E. Church was crowded to
the doors last night with the city's col
ored citizens, who heard Mayor . Schmltz
make his initial attempt at pulpit elo
quence. It had been previously announc
ed that the city's chief executive was to
discuss municipal affairs, but he ignored
such a temporal theme and confined him
self to remarks more fitting to the occa
sion and to the sanctity of the edifice. As
it was his debut, the Mayor did not ven
ture a discourse on the more profound
questions ef theology, but he promised
that at some future date - he would again
speak to Bethel Church congregation and
would then express his views at greater
length. Mayor Schmitz said In substance:
. Later when J. A. Scannavino, an em
ploye of Newbauer & Co.. visited the car
he found a piece of yellow paper lying on
the floor upon which were imprints of
coin, about the dimensions of $5 and $10
pieces. The supposition is that Baker had
folded his money in this piece of paper
and had it in his pockets when they were
turned inside out.
About 2 o'clock Eugene Bryant, engineer
in the railroad yards noticed that the door
of the car was unlocked, which aroused
his suspicion. He looked inside and saw
the watchman lying unconscious on the
floor with his pockets turned inside out.
Bryant at once notified the police and
Baker was taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where it was found that
he was suffering from a fracture of the
Fkull. It was some time later before he
was roused to consciousness, when he said
his name was Ellis Baker, but before he
could talk further he again lapsed into un
consciousness.
â¢ Detectives Dinan and Bailey, who were
on duty at police headquarters, were
notified and they made an investigation.
They found that the car contained chick-,
ens, consigned to Newbauer &.Co., 107
Front street, and that Baker had come
â¢from Kansas City as watchman. Several
Racks had been- tilled with chickens ready
to be carried away and it is presumed that
during Baker's temporary absence the
theives broke off the lock of the car and
Â¦were busily engaged filling the sacks with
chickens when Baker made his reappear
ance.. It is supposed that before he was
able to defend himself he was stricken
dawn by a blow on the head with some
blunt instrument and while . unconscious
his pockets were rifled. His papers were
found scattered over the car. His pocket
book, after being emptied had been
thrown into the yard, where It was dis
'covered by the detectives.
The police are investigating what has
every appearance of being an attempted
murder and robbery, in a chicken car at
the foot of Sixth street early yesterday
morning, the victim being Ellis Baker, the
watchman of the cjjt.
An immense number of people took ad
vantage yesterday of the fine weather to
participate in the excursion to the big
battleship Wisconsin, under the auspices
of the Turone booth of the Irish fair.
From 1 o'clock until 4:30 all of Peterson's
launches were pressed into service, and
the decks of the battleship were crowded
with visitors. They were shown the bis
guns and the revolving turrets, given a
look down the ventilators and allowed to
climb onto the bridge. The jackies were
attentive to the visitors, the majority be
ing handsomely gowned young ladies. The
committee from the booth, which had
charge of the details of the excursion
were Peter A. Byrne. T. G. Maguire, Dr
Keenan. J. J. Burnes, H. Wldder, P Ea
gan and J. P. Finnegan.
A neat descriptive catalogue of the col
lection has been. issued and altogether the

The art gallery of the Irish fair Is one
of the most Interesting and educational
features of the fair, indeed. The number
of meritorious paintings, of Irish scenery
and subject, by Irish artists, that the art
committee has been able to collect Is quite
surprising. In the collection the different
sections of the old country are noted.

MAYOR SCHMITZ
IN THE PULPIT
tive session of 1884-85 he was clerk of the
enrolling committee, in which capacity
he did excellent service. In 1885 he be
came a clerk in the registration office
under Registrar E. B. Pringle, and later
he served as deputy under Recorders E.
B. Read and Alexander Russell., At the
National Republican Convention held at
Minneapolis in 1892 he was sergeant at
arms of the California delegation, the
duties of which he discharged with sig
nal success. In 1894 he was appointed
wharfinger . by Commissioner Dan Cole,
being subsequently made assistant chief.
After four years of valuable service to
the State his ability was recognized by
his reappointment to the same office by
Major Harney, a Democrat. A year later
he was reappointed to the same position
by ! Paris Kilburn. Dryden's intimate
knowledge of shipping and matters per
taining to wharfage rendered him a man
of value to the public service, and it was
believed,' he would continue, to fill the
office permanently until the MnJoch- of
politics demanded him as a victim.
Dryden is well known in fraternal cir
cles. He was from 1882 till 1893 secretary
of the Wharf Builders* Union, and he has
held offices of trust and honor in his par
lor of Native Sons as well as in the
Grand Parlor. The recognition of his
ability and honesty by the United Rail
roads in- offering him a good berth will
be received with satisfaction by all who
know him. â¢ i
SHYING HORSE
CAUSES DEATH
Dryden is one of the most popular and
widely known of Native Sons. He . Is a
native of Oak.and, 38 years of age,' and
has a charming family, to which he is
devotedly attached. He began his public
career as a deputy under Tax Coiiector
Wadham years ago. During the legisla-
Scarcely was it known that Dryden had
fallen a victim to the machine than Ed
ward E. Gates, claims agent of the United
Railroads, made a bid for his services as
adjuster of claims for the company. Dry
den was In Santa Cruz at. the time and
he was immediately communicated with,
the result being his appointment on Url
day last. In his new field Dryden trill
no doubt duplicate the success his efforts
as assistant wharfinger met with in his
eight years' service as an employe of the
State.
IT was a genuine surprise to the
friends of George H. S. Dryden, the
popular and efficient assistant wharf
inger, when, through the agency of
machine politics manipulated by the
Gage push, he was removed 'and "Jack"
Tyrrell appointed in his stead. The many
years of capable ' service rendered by
Dryden, who, although himself a Repub
lican, was honored with . reappointnient
under Democratic rule, speak for his hon-.
esty and efficiency as an official. '.-, ;
Speaking of theatricals in New York,
Messrs. Belasco and Thall state that the
season just closing was profitable to all
engaged in the business. The stock
houses have been doliÂ»? well In the larger
cities, and new houses are being con
stantly opened.'
Manager Morrisey said last night that
he merely went East for a rest of two
weeks. He accompanied Mrs. Morrisey
to the home of her parents at O'Fallon,
111., where she will remain for her health
until the warm weather opens, when she
will return. This was her first journey
to the East in eight years, and. he found
it a very pleasant diversion.
For the Central we secured many thrilling
melodramas, all of which are reigning suc
cesses. These Include "Angel of the Alley,"
"Sunshine of Paradise Alley." "King of De
tectives," "Road to Ruin," "Between Love and
Duty," "Diamond Breaker," "Pledge of Hon
or," "Hell Gate." "Voice of Nature," "Jake
Green." "Biddell Bros.," "Guilty Mother."
"Derby Winner," - "Queen of Chinatown,"
"Woman Against Woman," "Train Robber,"
"Aunt Bridgett." "Humpty Dumpty" and
others of the same class. We look forward to
one of the best seasons from a theatrical stand
point known to the fraternity. . .
Among: the plays for the Alcazar secured by
us are many of the latest successes. These in
clude "Tree 'of Knowledge," "Cipher Code,"
"Willie," "Americans Abroad," "Gray Mare."
"Lady Bountiful," "Betsy Ross," "Home Sec
retary," "Pudd'nhead Wilson," "Hoosier Doc
tor" and others.
NEXT SEASON'S PLAYS.
For the Central we secured as leading woman
Fannie ilclntyre, one oÂ£ the best known melo
dramatic actresses in America. Her wardrobe
is contained in twelve trunks. 1 She was for
four years leading woman at Forepaugh's Thea
ter in Philadelphia. She wiU open at the Cen
tral next Monday in "The World."
We succeeded in securing some of the best
known actor folk in the business for the Al
cazar and Central theaters. The new leading
man for the Alcazar is a distinguished Eng
lish actor, whose name 1 am not at liberty
to divulge at this time. He is under contract
with a prominent manager and to reveal his
identity might prevent his securing his release.
The leading woman is Suzanne Santje, who
was four* years with the Frohmans. i-ast sea
eon, she was with Richard Mansfield, and she
was to have supported E. H. Sothern in "Ham
let" next season, but owing? to the fa^t that
Sothern's wife will not star next season, aa
originally Intended, she will support her hus
band. This left Santje free and we secured
her at a large salary. We also secured several
well-known actors who will open at the Alcazar
in September for the winter season.
In an interview. last night Belasco said
concerning his new plays and people:
NEW PLAYS AND PEOPLE.
After spending â¢ several weeks In the
East, a trio of well-known f local man
agers arrived home yesterday. They were
Fred Belasco and Sam Thall of the Al
cazar and Central theaters and John Mor
risey of the Orpheum. The first two
named went to New York to secure new
people and plays for their show-houses,
while Morrisey made a flying trip to
St. Louis with Mrs. Morrisey, who will
spend a few weeks with her parents near
that city. All express themselves as be
ing highly delighted with their journey
across the Rockies.
Belasco is especially jubilant at the re
sults of his journey. He congratulates
himself at having enjoyed the felicity of
acting as best man for Thall at the lat
ter's espousal of Miss E. L-. Gifford, a
charming young woman of Richmond,
Va. The marriage took place in New
York on April 19, and was a society event
at which many notable theatrical folk
were in attendance.
