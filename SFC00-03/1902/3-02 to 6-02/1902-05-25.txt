she prefers a pale pink waist, or a light
blue one of cheviot, cotton, or heavy
lawn, it takes nothing away from her
smartness. The white skirt with the
colored shirt will be worn not a little
this Eummer; and It Is pleasant to learn
that the very pretty and always much
admired Miss Pauline Astor wears such
a skirt, with a colored waist. This is
her rig for afternoons at Cliveden, that
country estate upon the Thames, where
the garden parties are given to the royal
princesses, and where smart gowns are

And, by the way, how stupid it is for
young people in London now. What with
the King coming out against "the young
girl in society": what with the daughters
of the King all grown up and married
or In a hopeless state of unmarriedness:
what with the little ones of the Wales
family too small to be out of the nur
sery; and no young princesses anywhere
available, it Is Indeed a season when the
young girl in London can pity herself
profoundly.
Yet she manages to have a good time.
Miss Astor wears a white suit, when in
London, in ctamine. Etamine is such a

capable of such a variety of treatment.
If you want It made up with ruffles and
lace, as a summer dress, then all right.
There are plenty of models. But it is
so much smarter to tailor It.
A tailored etamine was made upon the
long sheath lines just as plain as can be.
But there were panels of stitched etamine
put on down each side of the' skirt. Each
four inches wide, each stitched along the
edge, each used as a wide strapping. Tha
stuff was doubled so that it appeared
more like a panel of cloth, solid, than one
of open texture.
Can Tou Wear White P
There is a white zibiline. very light in
weight, but one must not invejn in it un
less one has many gowns. Those white
tloth dresses are apt to prove a sr.are for
the girl who must be economical. They
so soon soil, and when soiled they are
soon gone completely.
There are two. classes of women who
took very well in white. One is the big
fat woman, with plenty of figure. This
woman finds in white a merciful friend,
softening her outlines and making her
appear graceful.
The other woman is the very email
woman, she whom one calls petite. White
?ives her height and dignity and assists
lier in the matter of a "presence." It also
gives her that fairy like look which is the
privilege of the small woman.
The White Outing Girl.
1.N spite of the fact that cold winds
are 6till blowing the ambitious and
beauty loving woman insists on tell
ing us that summer is here.
She rushes the season, this pretty
creature, and in May she shows us June,
and in June she forces July and August
vpon us. Anything for a change Is her
motto in dress, and no matter how much
ihfc change may cost her. in time, in
money, and In personal wear and tear,,
she must have it.
There is a legend that no woman is
ever happy until she has worn a white
dress. Through the whole of the gentle
spring she awaits the day when she can
put It on; and, when, in the first blush
of flowering summer, she actually does
den it and sally forth, her joy Is com
plete.
A white dress, the perfectly smart
pedestrian one. consists of a skirt of
white duck or drill, and a white shirt
waist. It is quite swell to wear a hat
crowned with colored flowers with this,
and tan gloves.
Self-Trimmed Goods.
The white crepe goods will always be
liked because they make up so dreaslly.
In selecting there are many pretty and
new fabrics from which to choose. The
white cotton goods open up a great field
and the lace stripes, the linen stripes, the
satin stripes and the beautiful little
stamped white figures, all make variety.

It looked at the first of the' season as

The question of a lining is a perplexing
one to the woman 'who' dresses in whltp.
tor the lining costs more than the gown '
ar>d to line a 15-cent cotton means some
thing when viewed from the standpoint of
the pecketbook.
.As for the lining, it is a matter that
cannot be ignored. All or very nearly all
of the summer goods are transparent and
the lining Is distinctly visible, painfully
so .sometimes.
Of course it is possible to use the plain .
While wh'itc is made up with all sim
plicity, it is a sort of studied simplicity,
which is by no means plainness.. ,
The dee'i flounce around the foot is in
plain goods tucked at the top and released
at the botom to make, the necessary flare
and there are little bands of goods at the
head of the flounce with hemstitching
along each band.
Lace is used more elaborately in some
cases, than it need be. There is a wide
girdle of it, pointed top and bottom, -front
and back. The neck shows a band of lace
and 'ti lace point comes down to the bust.
The sleeves are finished with an elbow

Lace Trimmings.
The daintiest of summer gowns is made
from a material that is _a pale yellow,
the color of old lace. It has a cording
running through it and is soft and crepey.
At wide intervals there is a little puff of
the goods. All this is in the material it
self. It requires no other trimming ex
cept the little bit of lace, which goes on
all things.
One lovely bit of goods, just a plain
white cotton, .costing not much, shows
tiny rows of pin tucking with machine
hemstitching set in between the group of
tucks. Such a material is already
trimmed and Is all ready to be made up
into a waist.
looked as if she would have to work inter
minably week in and week out.
But all perplexities disappear before the
softening fingers of Time, and so with
the dress perplexity. As soon as the-ac
tual' summer goods came in and were
spread out upon the counters, one began
to notice the abundance and beauty of the
machine-made fabrics.
that show the lining too plainly.
But the prettiest gowns for the house
and many of the best gowns for the street
do "show through," and the lining ques
tion must be tackled boldly.
The Lining Question.
Here Is the advice of a very fashionable
dressmaker, who designs and executes for
the wives of millionaires:
"I begin at the very beginning," says
she, "and make my linings first."
"Mrs. A," mentioning the wife of a fa
mous multi-millionaire, "will noFbuy silk
linings, and one doÂ«s not blame her, for
in the summer they are not durable, and
a substitute that looks just as well must
be provided.
"For this woman and for many others
among my patrons I make very stylish
and wholly beautiful linings of the finest
of lawn. The waist is low in the neck
and is made like a corset cover, sleeve
less. It is elaborately trimmed with lace
and would do for an evening waist. It
cashes nicely and is made separate from
the gown< |
"For the skirt I make not. a petticoat,
but a perfect fitting, perfect hanging
dress skirt. It has its flounce, which is
very full, and it has its sweep length. It
would do very well indeed for a gown.
"When the dress is to be put on the
lining is first donned and hooked up, the
ekirt is now put on and hooked. Then the
dress is put on, bodice and skirt. "A per
fect fit is secured and the effect is lovely.
"I make up linings in all colors of tha
finest of lawn and in wash mull, and In
the thin goods, following always ona
mcdel, and my patrons have four and six
of them and often more, according to the
size of the wardrobe.
"The secret is in making both waist and
skirt so that they look like gowns, not
like corset cover and petticoat. My
patrons could attend a dinner In a lining.
Of that I am positive."
The Ethereal Gown.
The ethereal girl is the one who dresses
in the fairy goods. These come delicately
soft and thin, yet crisp, and they are de
signed for the making of afternoon and \
piazza, gowns.
There is quite a fad now for the gown
that is stiff and starchy, not soft and
clinging, and the mulls and linens seem
designed for this sort of treatment.
While the esthetic and artistic gownâ
the "slinky" one, that twists around one's
feet and gives one heightâ Is In fashion,
it is undoubtedly true that tha crisp,
sheer one is also In style, and tha after
noon maiden can see them both and takÂ«
her choice.
It is generally agreed among those who
make dress and its designing a life study
that the stiff, crisp linen and the delight
fully perky lawn, with Its starched effect,
are both meant more for country wear!
for hotel piazzas, when one can keep
one's self in picture attitudes, than for
the street.
These little dresses are trimmed with
Valenciennes usually, or with the softest
and finest of summer laces, and are made
with the lace set in the skirt and with
lace set in the. waist. There is usually a
baby-like yoke upon such a waist, and
this is completed with a juvenile ruffle ot
lace. Around the foot is a dear, crisp lit
tle flounce.. The elbow sleeves are fin
ished with a. little lace ruffle. !
Miss Simplicity will dross in white this
cummer, with the white waist buttoning
down the back; she will have a yoke, bor
dered with a lace ruffle, and her stock
will be little more than a lawn band with
lace along each edge. Her skirt will be
very simple and rather full. It will ba
finished with a very fluffy little lace
flounce. And she will wear a sash.
The Home Dressmaker.
It is a fine summer for the woman who
wants to do her own dressmaking, for In
the newest of dress fabrics are seen those
that have lace set in, after the most dell
cate ways.
There are the mullsâ though they are a
little bit expensiveâ that have really nice
laco set in to form a sort of design, large
irregular diamonds and little swirls of
lace. You have to pay the price but
think, of doing the work yourself!
The foulard asserts itself summer after
summer, and you fall a victim, though
you don't know why. Foulard is never a
ver\- dressy goods, and it is never very
cheap. But it is, oh! so very ladylike. In
a summer foulard one can face the world
if it is made up prettily. /
There ' are foulards and foulards and
many ways of making them.
A certain elegant importing establish
ment of Gotham makes a specialty of
them. They are in Chinese blue, old cold
tobacco brown, navy blue, black, and in
many shades of green, making a gre'at
variety. All show the figure upon a white
ground, or the white figure upon a col
ored groundâ tht; ; unmjstakable foulard

A Hundred Dollar Foulard.
These gowns are beautifully made, and
none costs less than $100. It is ahnost
a commentary upon the beauty ot the
gowr,3 when you know that the" firm has
difficulty in filling its orders at 5190 each
Now, here is a $100 foulard, just such a
one as was purchased by Mrs. -Clarence
Mackayâ and perhaps the very same one:
The foundation was in two shades of

The Very Large Hat.
The large hat. meanwhile, la enjoying
an unrivaled popularity. It is big and it
sets upon the hair in certain approved
ways. It must tilt a little, and probably
there is a bow at the back; that seems to
be necessary.
The Lord Kitchener hat has its boa.
It is in white chiffen. while the top is
startling in the intensity of its brilliant
red flowers. They are large and very
red, its leaves are large and very green.
It used tu be thought not nice to v/ear
a brilliant hat in the street, ami women
of the best taste sought the black hnt^
with its ribbons and plumes and itsr
rhlnestoiie ornaments.
But this season you see hats made all
of glaring red geraniums, and you see
them built cf violets very bold in hue and
of pansles that are not at all shrinking
but that force themselves in all their
color, upon you.
If a "loud" hat Is becoming to you, by
ail means wear one, for it will be in good
taste, sanctioned by the best dressers in
the world who put on their flower gar
dens and sally forth complacently.
The true boa of summer is built of very
thin goods, chiffon preferred, with silk
muslin running a close second. It i3
dotted with silk lozenges, and it is fin
ished along the edge, with the tiniest of
little ribbon ruffles.
One can spend a great deal of time and
some money on this summer boa and be
â¢well repaid in the matter of looljs. The
length just bow is to the waist, and the
boa must surely match the hat. Falling
this, it should be in white, made of white
silk muslin and little satin ribbens. There
are loves of boas, charming enough to
grace any occasion and any gown.
It is just the time of year when one ia
winding up one's preparations for the
summer. One sees many things that have
been left unbought. Prices are down and
the temptation to purchase is great.
It is a great compliment to our native
wares that American women are buylne,
their goods in this country, and even jw^
the ,vast numbers that have gone ov e f
this/ year for the coronation very few
nav* made any plans for bringing home
a wardrobe. Uncle Sam's clothes are good
enough for them. '
Stout women find this smooth front a
positive godsend. And again is the llttla
woman suited, for, with the plain, softly
trimmed front, guiltless of button or
seam, she becomes positively babyish.
There is something in her petite pretti
ness which takes at once to the waist
that buttons down the back. So It is
well to compromise with one's friends
and one's family, and to make arrange
ments to be buttoned up with regularity
and care.
" The front forms a fine field for the dU
play of jewelry, and at a luncheon,
very dressy one, to introduce a muaicaih
relative of Somebody-or-Other to society,
the ladies looked as though decorated
with all the orders of the United King
dom. There Is always the locket which
hangs from a slender invisible chain, and
there ia the dangle which hangs from Its
long chain.
Lovely sets of pins coma now, four
beautiful, clear pearl ones, looking Ilka
mother-of-pearl and a. large oval pin to
match. AH these are for the front of tha
seamless waist and are to outline tha
yoke and trim it. They are set along at
intervals, with the big one In the middle.
The big hat grows bigger and tha little
hat grows smaller as the season warms.
The latter is for matinee and for very
nice reception occasions and for special
events. But it can hardly be called a
street hat. Indeed, many do not own tha
tiny little hat; and really draw no medi
um between the big hat and none. at all.
For a tiny hat, if wear one they must,
women compromise upon a coiffure or
nament which consists of a feather, an
aigrette, a few gems and a bow of vel
vet ribbon, the whole bearing a wavy
look as though it were a thing of air.
Everything is done to add to the light
ness of the hair ornamented, to Its fly
ing" qualities, so to speak. The orna
ments are perched on spirals that they
may dence and the flowers are attached
to wiry stems to make them sway; tha
aigrette- floats, from very lightness, and
the ribbons are perched in very perky lit
tle wavs.
The Closed Front.
Many of the handsomest new gowns
are closed in the back and this style
is becoming to all. It is youthful and
graceful, and the fact that it is a nuis
ance is the only argument against it.
.Many o'f ihe s.ik Dodices axe made witn.

most as well to make the tails of silk to
match the gown, and attach them to a
belt to form a postillion belt.- Then ona
need not always wear the little rear
tabs. That they are becoming there is no
doubt and that they give height and slexx
derness is undisputed. Yet it is pleasant
to be able to do without them.
The woman who studies the fashions
and designs her own gowns is as a rula
the woman who gets along on a cloth in
the spring, a summer siik, a little blazer
coat, a few skirts and as many shirt
waists as she can get. It is well witn
such a wararobe to have each garment

WOLFVILLE STORIES
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD PLAY THE FASCINATING GAME OF WHIST
BY MRS. E. P. SCHELL.
THE rotary discard was first sug
gested by P. J. Tormey in an ar
ticle published in the January num
ber of Whist, 1S95. In the rotary
the fall of a single card gives your
partner exact information, so that he can
lead you the highest card of the suit and
does not take any chances with little
cards to be caught by the adversaries.
The usual form of the rotation of the
suits is spades, hearts, clubs and dia
monds, but the one in xnost general usage
in our local clubs is the alphabetical ro
tary- I think perhaps the reason of this
is that alphabetically it Is easier to re
member. The alphabetical rotary is clubs,
diamonds, hearts and spades. The first
step In the case\jf the "rotary" is for
thÂ« partners to arrange their cards in the
following rotation: Clubs, diamonds,
hearts and spades, remembering always
to eliminate the trump. If your suit is
diamonds you should discard a club, or if
it is hearts you discard a diamond. Spades
being your suit you should discard a
heart, if cluo% a spade should be dis
carded, and so on around the circle. Now
to make It clear about the elimination of
trumps, let us say hearts are trumps and
spades your suit; the discard should be
a diamond. Hands frequently occur
where the necessity of following'lts exact
and literal demands would' cause the sac
rillce of a card too valuable to be parted
with, of a guard to an honor, or worse
still, of an honor Itself. This rigidity
has prevented the general adoption of the
rotary as an Invariable discard by the
better whist players, although in a limited
form it can be most advantageously com
bined with the old discard \ of strength
and weakness according to the trump sit
uation, and it la in this limited form-that
is now generally advocated.
The limited rotary discard is so called
because its use is confined to cases where
partner has opened trumps as the original
opening of the dealt and is still in , the
lead, the trump suit not having been dis
continued at the end of the trick where
the discard card takes place. If the
trump lead has been interrupted .and one
of the opponents has opened his suit there
is no need for a rotary discard, as of tha
iwo remaining suits the*' discard should
be from weakness.' All whis.t '-: players
know from experience how troublesome
the old discard was. When you were lead
ing trumps, partner followed two. or
three times, how desirable it was that
the one discard he would make should
give you exact information. It was in
such situation that the old discard was
lacking, while announcing that as the
discarder's weakest suit gayÂ© not the least
information as to which was the stronger
of the other two remaining suits. :
Cases arise .every â¢ day .where another
lead, of trumps: is either extremely dan
gerous or absolutely Impossible. It Is In
just such Â¦ situations as this that, the ro
tary is useful. When the two are com
bined, the rotary to be used in the limited
form and the discard of strength and
weakness, according to trump situation In
all other cases, we have *the most {Satis
factory system . of - discard yet suggested.

To illustrate a typical case, let us intro
duce Mr. Jones. He decides that he would
like to spend a year in travel, and. after
mapping out an itinerary, he makes an
estimate of the amount of money it will
be necessary for him to spend. He fixes
the amount, say, at $10,000. The average
traveler doea not care to load himself
down with any such sum, because, in ad
dition to the inconvenience of handling
it, be makes himself a possible target for
thieves In case they learn of his posses
sions. He can, of course, divide this sum
into smaller amounts by drawing bills of
exchange, payable on certain banks in
certain cities throughout the world, but
the latter of credit affords a much more
simple and satisfactory method of keep
ing himself supplied with funds.
ONE of the most interesting features
of the business substitute for actual
money, and a substitute that is
used by nearly every trans- Atlantic
traveler, is the letter of credit.

It is possible that the pressure of public
opinion may cause^he war authorities at
"Washington to censure General Smith In
order to make the people believe that the
administration is opposed to the methods
which he has employed. We often need a
scapegoat, and politicians like the present
adjutant general sadly need to draw oft
popular attention from their affairs ta
those of their rivals.

1902, Mr. Root, the Secretary of War.

Gen. Bell's Retaliation Proclamation.
Here are a few words quoted from a re
port by General J. F. Bell, commanding
the Department of Batangas, a believer
in concentration on the Weyler and
Kitchener plans:
"The brigade commander therefore an
nounces for the information of all con
cerned that wherever prisoners or un
armed or defenseless Americans or natives
friendly to the United States Government
are murdered or assassinated for political
and this fact can be established.
It is his purpose to execute a prisoner of
war under the authority contained In sec
tions 59 and 148. This prisoner of war will
be selected by lot from among the officers
or prominent citizens held as prisoners of
war, and will be chosen, when practicable,
from those who belong to the town where
the murder . or assassination has oc
curred."
We read to-day the private lives of
Grant, Sherman, Sheridanâ we admire
them for the domestio virtues they culti
vated, for the human sympathies they
awakened on all sides.
But their Joint opinion of pacifying the
Southern States was well epitomized In
the words, "War Is hell!"
War may or may not be thatâ we shall

testimony unites In condemning It as thÂ»
nearest approach to what our Imagination
delights to picture as the opposite of
Christian endeavor.
Sheridan was a witness to many battles
In the Franco-German war, and spoke In
sorrow of German retaliation at Bazeilles.
What will a German say Who reads the
account of bis operations In the Valley of
Virginia In 1364? In the fall of that year,
hearing that one of his lieutenants had
been murderedâ let ma quota his own
words, "I ordered an the house* within an
- area of five miles to be burned."
Sheridan does not inquire whether the
alleged murderer lived within this terri
tory, or whether It was fair that hundreds
of innocent women and children should ba
turned oat of doors In the face of an ap- /
proachlng winter. It was war. and the
more hellish war could be madÂ© tha bet
ter.
General Smith, who to-day excites tha
simulated indignation of politicians, can
console himself by reading In the memoirs
of General Sheridan the following letters
from General Grant, written within tea
r days one of tha other:

Flag of Truce in Philippine Fighting.
On November 11, 1899, this same General
Smith, then a colonel, made a report from
Capas, in which he remarks:
The energetic hard work of those who have

Impossible to impress this fact upon our of

None of the natives haa any love for the
Americans, but rather secret hate In their souls

requirements of Lukban through fear, a feel

Â¦why it must bs so, and believes
that General Smith is a "fine

honorable and efficient in his

gressive in his dealings "with
the natives within his juris

agined that the natives were angels and only
needed wings to make them perfect.
Just now our press is in a violent state
of indignation against General Jacob H.
Smith, who. in the Manila Critic of Feb
ruary i, 1302, published the following over
his name. This account refers to his
campaign in Samar:
A German officer who had served with
distinction in 1570-71 told me seriously that
It was well that the war closed when It
did (for Germany); that the moral de
terioration of his men was apparent; that
they were growing ominously familiar
with the practice of bullying peasants
helping themselves to what they liked;
that the bonds of discipline became per
ceptibly lax as the weeks of war
dragged on.

He enters the ranks with a shudder at
the eight of blood; in a few weeks he
finds his appetite unimpaired by a pile of
corpses at his elbow, and he ends by re
garding his enemy with the complacency

Let us believe that the visit of Ger
many's sailor Prince to the United States
has caused this mellowness of feelingâ let
us pray that the understanding so pleas
antly established reflects a growing sentl
jrÂ«nt of good will throughout both em
piresâbut let us be honest, and therefore
let us not allow ourselves to appear more
humane than we really are.
How is it that, while Germany turns so
a light upon the veldt, she draws
"a Eoftening film across the glass that
points to our operations for the civiliza

We Americans are strong on sending
missionaries to the alleged heathen, an!
when we made war against Spain we
based our action on the ground of human
ity. General Weyler was depicted as a
eavagc, who starved and insulted women
in camps of concentration. Kitchener is,
by German account, charged with doing
the sajne in South Africa. We now prao
tice in the Philippines the same concen

THE SUNDAY CALL. . ,
"WAR IS HELL" SAID GENERAL W.T. SHERMANWHO knew Bret Harte?"
"1."
And what did you know about
him?"
Xo answer.
They are ready enough with their "I'fa,"

of Frank Bret Harte, only thrice capital

all ready enough, with the exception 'of

Ciguar.tly, "Uo you suppose 1 date back

The truth of the matter is, nobody ever

Afck tne people of London's literary col
ony. Harte spent his late years in Eng
land, where he lived as a m^n of literary
distinction. Surely he must have been
known in London. He must have had
lime to be known there, living in the
iuxury of laurels won.
"JCo." they answer, the London folk.
"Why didn't you ask us about somebody
else? We know other literary peopk

Biet Harteâ oh, he was different."
Ask the people of the' mines. They wen:

And yet these are the men of whom
he wrote.
Ask the white-haired populace of San
Francisco. They are all ready enough to
remember him, but pin them down to
facts and they will tell, you that. "Harte
always kept a goodVdeal to himself."
Harte did. He never liked people. He
was never the good fellow. The men who
worked beside him in the same office, who
lived beside him on the same street, never
knew him.
Bret Harte put up a wall around himself
and drew himself within it and stayed
there to his dying day.

If he was a snob he was an intellectual
one. Money and what It buya were never
a source of vanity with him. In fact, h*
never was known to have any of either.
Bret Harte's life in San Francisco was a
hard luck story.
Not that he didn't make money. He did.
There was a time when he was drawing
three comfortable salaries at once: On*
hundred and fifty dollars from the Mint,
an average of twice as much from the
Overland Monthly and a good round sum
from old Trinity Church on the Plaza, In
which his wife, formerly Miss Grlswold,
sang.

flower. .. .
. He 'never liked sports; he never liked
roughing it. He did not hunt, nor fish,
nor ride. When . he went, to the country
he stayed indoors and read and wrote.
He. and Anton Roman built a cabin In
the Santa Cruz -Mountains one summer â
somewhere near the spot -that is now
Wrights. It was a rough and picturesque
place, lonely and romantic. The Harte
and the Roman families used to join
forces and go to this mountain spot every
week,' to get away from the world for a
Saturday to Monday. The place would
tempt a man to be out of doors if any
thing would; but Harte spent most of
his' time j inside ' the rude walls poring
over, books and manuscripts.^ On Monday
morning -he could be seen returning to
town, his arms full of copy ready for pub
lication. â¢
Â¦ Afterward he moved to San Rafael, for
the sake, so he said, of living nearer na
ture; and he still carried his copy back
and forth and wrote like a clerk while
hs was over there. He carried his proofs
and manuscripts in a mail bag, and ev
erybody .knew- him by that bag.
There was one short period when he
was' able to live In fairly smart styleâ
for then^ That was when Swain made him
his secretary at thÂ« .Mint. The Mint was
on Commercial street, where the Treas-
by and none of the promised letters from
him arrived. Harte forgot Californiaris. !
Those 'rare .ones who did know him In
armors or less informal way never found
him a great talker. . He was a listener.
He liked to; hear, miners talk, and those
who knew -the mines, for from such peo
ple he drew, the' sources of his stories.
He knew, little enough of the mines at"
first hand.' ;;/... â¢ '
, He was- not gifted as a conversational
ist. 'He never: attempted to be witty. Joe
Spear remembers him as he, along, with
"Old .Zander," used to come Into Spear's
store, on California '.'street and sit there,
afternoon in and afternoon out, joining
little in ithe. talk that went on about him.
He sat back and watched people and lis
tened to them, studying character in his
own quiet way. ,-.-â¢Â¦ ','-.' .
He never joined men in their ordinary
amusements. In the old . Occidental,
Â¦which was frequented in those days as
the clubs are now, he used 'to. stand back
from the table and watch from a distance
while others played billiards. He never
seemed particularly interested in the
game. Mark Twain, ready to mix in any
thing there was going,' played a great
deal and well, and Harte would accom
pany him to the billiard-room, thenâ he
would make a wall-flower of himself.
That -was what Bret, Harte was in . all
he got Westphalia ham at, home after KV
married, but he must have missel It If
he did not. However, he never left home
for the sake of It. George Merrill, on*
of the few men In town who has a tnxly
friendly word for the lonely genius, says
that he was a domestic man, > keeping
closely at home, where he read and wrot*
persistently.
Harte was by no means a religious man
in the usual sense of the word. ; Ha was a
thinker and a philosopher, but hÂ« had
no use for churches. What his real creed
was nobody seems to know.' Ha wu far

the drifts of dust that would emerge from
his door when the wind blew, she occa
sionally took a broom and entered. Â¦Â¦ She
always found so many things in need- of
her good' care that when he returned he
was bound to detect her. ... ' : ',
Later on the two of them moved to an
other house in. Oakland, what^Charles
Warren ' Stoddardâ Charlie, as he' always
was to Bret Harteâ called a bungalow. It
.was , built Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ by Stoddard's father. . Harte
took an interest in the place ' and tried
to improve It. building '" a fence around
It with his- own' hands. l~- . . ..-
His later dwelling places In San Fran
cisco, were scattered from one end of the
city to the otherâ those ends being nearer
together than they are . now. Â» He lived
on Folsom 1 street and on Silver street,
both in the southern . part of , town. . At
another; time he .lived, over toward the
North Beach, on Greenwich street. 'After:
he was married he occupied a house long,
since torn' down at the corner of Bush and
Hyde: streets!!' / ' ' i ,
Hyde street was pretty remote in those
days, being decidedly westernâ about what;
the Western Addition is" to us : now.. It
was so far outas -to-be of the distant res
idence district. The funerals-going to the
western "cemetery used to pass, that way
as a regular thing, and Harte; s children
took to playing funeral. .This amused him'
Immensely, and :at times* he played- with^
them.' ' Â¦ 'Â¦'. Â¦ Â¦"; '
"I'll be, the hearse," he used to say, ancl
down he would go on his hands and knees
and march at the head of the impromptu
funeral procession, with a feather dus

But only a..very few Intimates ever knew
that Bret" Harte unbent, even ; In the
bosom of his' own family. His real friends
might' have been counted upon his two
hands, and almost if not quite ten sub

in his friendship when he went East had
to grow skeptical of it when time went
with any of those whose admiration he
coveted. He managed to get a ' peep at
their eyes out of- the corners of his,
enough to let him see if they were look
ing.
But there was a large part of the time
when he was lucky if he could keep from
being actually shabby. He never was
sloppy, like his friend, Mark Twain,- be
cause he hated untidiness, but he was
often threadbare. He lived with nothing
lesp than frugality, and the wonder of
the thing is what he did with his money.

jnce a yearâ were always simple In the
extreme. He . didn't spend his money in

He had no dissipations, so say both his
friends and enemies. He. did not drink,
he did not gamble, he did not care for
women. His money did not go in those
ways. ', Â¦ . â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦. .'; . .
' Most certain of all, he never caved. That
was the thing most, remote from his mind.
If he made out to live from day to day
he was doing very wellâ for Bret Harte.
And yet he always lived in a scrap of
a house, had no more furniture than was
absolutely necessary, and was in need
of borrowing from one week's end to the
other..; . .
When he first came to California in 1854
he brought his mother, and they went to
living In ; a mite of a house In Oakland.
It was near the water front, almost fac
ing the Alameda marshes. His room was
a little box at the top of the stairs,
lighted ;only by, a sky window. It was
hardly big enough for a bird cage.
He used to get into that bird cage and
bury his nose in a book for hours at a
time. He could, not then afford to buy
books outright; he used to get them on
the installment plan from a bookseller
who took an interest in him. He bought
several volumes of Dickens In this way,
paying 10 cents a week. The (bookseller
grew so -Interested In him and his love
for literature that at last he advanced
him the remainder of the set/some half
dozen volumes and let Harte pay for
them at his leisure. !' .
Harte had something of a knack for
carpentry, and he built himself a shelf In
his sky parlor and thereon ranged his
library. He used the volumes until the
leaves were loose. His mother used to
ury is to-day, and he was given apart
ments across the street from hi3 place of
business.
It happened In this way: Swain dis
covered him. took an interest in him and
said:
"You ought to have some kind of a
snap (that is if they called : it snap then)
which would provide for you- while you
write according to your inspiration."
So he got him the place in the Mint at
a salary of $130 per month and fitted up
the apartments ntar by so that none of
his precious time should be lost in going
and coming. It was popularly said that
he got $150 a month for signing his name
once a day. At any rate, the place was
easy. He wrote poems at his dtsk in the
Mint, and he wrote poems in his com
fortable apartments across the street and
he wrote poems all the time.
His rooms were well furnished, but he
soon made them look as disreputable as
the true genius is supposed to do. He Ut
tered them with scraps of written and
rewritten literature. There were days
when he did nothing but write and de
stroy, when his paper could not get prom
ised copy â¢ from him, but still Swain had
faith In him and furnished him with the
needed wherewithal.
Â¦ One day Harte received a visit from
some swell English acquaintances. Ha
went to Swain and asked for money to
entertain them with. Already he had- a
touch of the Anglo-mania that developed
so -greatly later in life.
"I've 'spent all my salary," Harte said.
"Can't you advance me enough with which
to entertain these people?"
"How much do you need?" Swain asked.
"Five hundred will do."
"Five hundred is yours."
Harte took the amount and sallied forth
to attempt sociability. He was nothing
of a good fellow, but he was determined
to make a bluff at being one for the once.
The next day Swain met him making tho
rounds with his Â¦ smart Englishmen.
Harte. cut Swain" dead.
It was such things as this that caused
him to' be remembered as "not one of th*
boys."
"He was always so terribly sober," on*
of the old-timers said, "in those days
you had to go into a saloon now and then
to be popular."
Harte was not a teetotaler, though. It
he was asked to have a drink he would
not refused He simply was not the kind
to treat or be treated as a common thing.
Occasionally he was to be seen usually
drinking alone at Barry & Patton's, the
popular resort on - Montgomery street,
where drinks were twenty-five cents and
mixed; to the liking of a prince. But no
body ever knew of Breti Harte' s drinking

her coming with frenzied Impatience she
will probably encounter no difficulty."
At that time Miss Fealy was the bright
particular star of her own mother's dra
matic school of acting In Denver, Colo.,
and was more than passing clever; and
winsome in such roles as Juliet Parthe
nia, NIobe, Galatea, Virginia and the
whole range of Shakesperean heroines.
When Daly first beheld her she was fresh
from her first triumph as Juliet to
Blanche Walsh's Romeo, an assumption
of a masculine part that won fame for
Miss Walsh and, incidentally, a new re
nown for both in the metropolis of the
Rocky Mountains. " ' ' â¢ . "
This was all' the more noteworthy be^
cause' for years the dramatic critics had
been lamenting the non-appearance of an
ideal Juliet. They had always declared
that the adipose, middle-aged lady who
1 generally plays the; part in the greatest
love drama "ever written is not the fair
young child of innocence that Shakespeare
drew. And so it was that Daly found In
the pretty little Denver maid a positive
novelty, whose youth alone was her great
est and strongest advertisement, 1 though
there was an elusive charm in her fresh.
Innocent face, the lack of the
look In her eyes "and . the convincing ex
pression she gave^ to the most , dramatic
scenes in her repertoire of plays.
But It was ' here that the long list of
laudatory press notices for her youthful
talent suddenly ceased, for Augustin Daly
fell Into the last sleep that knows no
awakening, and then It was that the
pretty little child prodigy found; herself
stranded in New Â¦ York. Â¦ The . great â¢ and
glorious ,- international :l career she had
looked forward to was seemingly coma to
an Ignominious end." ~ "' .*. *
But it was at this point that Richard
"How did you know that?" asked Mis3
Fealy in a startled tone.
"There Is a certain something in your
manner," the Interviewer began.
"What is it? An evidence of indolence?
No, call It by its right nameâ laziness. la
that it?"
The interviewer protested
"You needn't deny it," protested Miss
Fealy, trembling under the excitement of
the ordeal as the criminal might quake
at an awful sentence. "It's true. Most
Southern girls are indolent, or lazy. But
you mustn't forget the Southern climate."
"Then you are a Southern girl?"
VYes. I was born in Memphis, Tenn.,
though since my mother married a sec
ond time and went to live in Denver I've
always claimed to be a Western girl. You
know the California girls are famed as
the best actresses. jj So It's too bad that
mamma did not go to San Francisco In
stead of Denver. Then I should have been
ever so much greater. What! Is that all
the Interview? Really, I had expected
something quite dreadful."
It was Just about this time that . the
startling though gratifying news "was
sent broadcast that William Gillette had
engaged pretty . little Maude Fealy for
his new leading lady In "Sherlock
Holmes."- She had reached her goal In
one sudden *bound, though, as sha said,
"it seemed bo funny to hear myself so
constantly spoken of u th* youngest
leading lady en the stage.
"Mr. Gillette hadn't seen xnÂ« wtien Mr.
Stohman decided to engage me, and when
he Â«aid I looked too young I hurried
much of a chance; but it was a notable
circumstance that in both the New York
and the London run of the play pretty
little Maude Fealy divided full honors
with the author in every scene.
The Englishmen liked her because shaâ¢
looked so very girlish in her simple little
frock of white crepe de chine, high necked
and pouched, the skirt tucked and the
bodice relieved by a lace yoke. She wore
her hair parted and rolled Into a bun at
the back â such a head being quite re
freshing against modern overdressed coif
fures.
Added to all this Miss Fealy has al
ways been wise in selecting a good and
obedient photographer, one who never
makes her look as young as she really Is.
"I didn't know that great secret," she
says, "until I was 17 years old and left
tho stage to go to school, only appearing
in stock companies during my summer va
cations. Then jit was that I found some
difficulty In getting engagements. Man
agers said I was capable, but too young;
and oh, how I longed to- be five and twen.
ty! And that was less than three years
ago. I can scarcely realize that It is
not all a dream even yet"
And this. In a sketchy sort of way, is
the new star who went from the West to
rise In the East, and who now comes to
San Francisco for the first time to prove
to us that she Is a brilliant of the first
order. She has certainly had a meteor toy
career during the past three yearaj
which cannot be altogether due to youth,
beauty and skillful advertising, which
makes her engagement doubly rich la
premise.
Mansfield was attracted to her. He had
heard how she j had first appeared a wee
little tot as the angel in the ascension
scene in "Faust," when she had asked of
her jiother' when ., the red light was
thrown upon her, "Do I look pretty, mam
ma?',' and laughed over; the story. But he
sent for her, was charmed by her youth
and Impulsiveness, gave her the part of
Roxane to rehearse and lost her only be-"
cause a better Â¦ opportunity was offered
her, by the Ueblers to create the role of
Eunice in "Quo Vadls.''
She' was now, just turned 17 years old
and this was - her first . chance to make a
real metropolitan furor, such as she had
always^ dreamed of. She wasted no pain3
over.lt ' She gave to the part a wondrous
beauty hitherto \ undreamed of, but when
she was interviewed after her first suc
cess her childish ingenuousness most apt
ly, contrasted with her â¢ sudden rise - to
fame. '
/â¢/The critics, praise my performance en
tirely, too much," she said, with' the air
of gravity of one three times, her age.
Then she laughed and added t "But I
like It" .
"You see," she went on again seriously,
"that, although I'm only 17 and ; this is
my first Interview, I : have 'become most
horribly practical and human. I love my
art and am ambitious to succeed. I sup
pose I ought to say. that Most actresses
do; don't : they ? But Â¦ I know that I have
much to learn and that beautiful I parts
like Juliet require , a great deal of stud jr."
'.â¢You are a Southern : girl, 1 are you hot r *
asked ' the Interviewer Irrelevantly.
"I have never believed In tendering un
limited assurance of future greatness to
young people who possess talent. Too
often it ruins what otherwise might have
proved a successful career. But in the
case of little Miss Fealy one's arguments
in this strain are somewhat disarmed by
her own excellent lack of self-conscious
ness. She has everything in her favor at
presentâ youth, beauty, talent, opportu
nityâand if she only sails to the wind
ward of the idea that the future of dra
matic art rest upon her own diminutive
All of which is very flattering, but it
played absolutely no part whatever in
Augustin Daly's judgment of her talents
when he said, after engaging her for five
years:
"The lines promise excellent health, and
the life line indicates many years' of suc
cess. The right hand shows the develop
ment of self-confidence over a naturally
sensitive, retiring nature. The upward
lines from the life line are strongest at
about the age of 25, and at that age also
the fate line shows a decided strengthen
ing. The line of brilliancy or fame is
well pronounced in the right hand, and
the full Mount of Apollo promises marked
success along artistic lines.
"Lines of travel are numerous, and the
hand promises an eventful life."
"Imagination is well-developed, as is
also the Mount of Venus, showing love of
beauty, harmony,, music and art.
"The thumb is particularly well balanced,
combining a quiet but strong determin
ation with tact, logic and reason. The
lingers have enough of tne conic type to
give inspiration and intuition, but not im
pulse. This hand will never rush into a
situation recklessly. It will carefully an
alyze a character before attempting to
portray it. The thumb shows decided ex
travagance and liberality. The band
does not promise the accumulation of
money, although there is the ability to
make it.
"When one . considers that this is the
hand of a mere childâ a young lady but
sixteen years of ageâ It is surprising that
it should show such decision of character.
Like the hands of so many Western people
of prominence, this palm belongs to the
spatulate type. This gives the necessary
originality and independence of character,
enabling the owner to develop a distinct
individuality, which is particularly de
sirable in the pursuit of histrionic fame.
This rather extraordinary girl has been
acting since she was a little tot of three
years old, but her real success, strange as
it may seem, has been built on her su
perstitious faith in the prophetic belief
in the palmfstry analysis of her hand by
Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall. He said:
Now, the same slender, gentle maid,
grown to nineteen years old, returns to
tlie West from the conquest of stageland
âfrom the success the world loves as the
Englishman loves a lordâ from interna
tional fame In New York and Londonâ a
eta;-. Such in brief is the career of Miss
Maude Fealy, the youngest Juliet and the
strangest stage favorite In histrionic his
tory. She opens an extended engagement
at the Grand Opera House as "Babbie"
in "The Little Minister" to be followed by
"The Two Orphans," "Romeo and Juliet,"
and possibly "Shylock" and several other
classic and standard plays, with E. J.
Morgan as heading man, just to show hen
versatility.

MAUDE FEALY'S
RISE TO
FAMEmon look about it. While ruffles are all
the rage and while they are just as
dainty as they ever wereâ still there Is
no denying It that they have been used
almost since the time of Eve.
The sleeves are long and tight fitting,
and are, of course, made of the all-over
lace that forms the yoke. In; place of a
fancy collar or a piece of ribbon the laee
itself has loeen boned and pressea into,
duty. â¢ .
Then only one thing remains to be fin
ishedâthe waist line; Just at present
ribbon and sashes are quite the proper
caper and really what . could ; be; prettier
or. more girlish?: Do not bone the ribbon
in : front. Just take about five ~ ards of
soft taffeta or a double-faced satin and
People generally think that all white
Is necessary for such an occasion. But
that idea is . fast being relegated to the
past. Black ribbon in the hair is much
prettier than white. For instance, these
days two bows are considered Â¦ quite
necessaryi one at the top of the , coil
and cne at the nape of the neck. Now a
white bow looks awkward and a black
velvet one chic.'* If you are going to wear
one at all why not select the one that Is
the prettiest?
And it is exactly the same with slippers
and hosiery. White is bound to make the
feet .look larger, not' to mention the an
kles., Black has just the opposite effect,
making .them look very small and dain
ty.; If the: frock is long enough the feet
show very little; in fact every step pushes
the skirt just a wee bit in advance of
the foot, and the boot Is of little or. no
consequence, so far as color is concerned.
However, if you really want to stick to
the good old rule, select what is known
as the colonial tie and get it of undressed
kid. Those come with a very' high heel â
such a heel as Is generally used on the
stage and that gives a swell arch to the
instep: The' buckle, either of gold or of
silver, is a pretty addition, and a new
one that Is very popular, so you will make
no mistake in wearing them. Once In a
while you will see the white slippers with
a black buckle, or an oxidized one, but
draw It about the waist. Draw it tight,
Just as snug as you can comfortably
stand it, for that will make you look trim
and neat. Incidentally, if you have held
the Â¦ribbon in f ront in a V-shape - it will
stay there witli little or no persuasion.
Draw it up on.thehips and up in back as
'high as possible:- That gives the dip that
everybody is trying to get these days.
Then tie the ribbon and do not make long
bows. Just as sure . as you do the entire
effect of the frock will be ruined. Tiny
stiff ends are what; is wanted. Naturally
the remainder of the ribbon falls here
and there just as it feels Inclined and it
is never stiff, you may : rest 'assured.
What if it does fall longer than the
skirt is on the sides? That does not make
any difference to you and It does make
a vast one to. the person, behind you. For
you and your gown ought to look just
about as swagger as they make them.
. It is strange how some slight thing will
alter a frock for the , better or the worse.
A clever notion has been adopted lately
with sheer frocks and it serves admir
ably. Corset covers are out of the ques
tion, when the yoke is cut very low and
when the sleeves are transparent as well.
The strap across the shoulders looms up
most decidedly.
Naturally the waist is lined, and that
lining is perfectly plain. But it need not
be' that' way.' J.Madame' Modish thinks that
JAPAN has some marriage customs
that are at variance with our
Western ideas on the question. In
the first place, love doesn't enter
into the contract at,alL
The primary purpose in a Japanese girl's
marriage is to get her placed where she
will be well connected and Â¦ well cared
for. No mother In all Japan would for a
moment be so foolish as to think of giv
ing her daughter in marriage to* a young
man who had no home ready for her re
ception. He must have the necessary
means to care for his wife and he must be
able to show a creditable family tree-
Without these essentials he might love
the girl to desperation and she might re
gard him with equal ardor, but he would
never get her.
The Japanese maiden in any. event does
not choose her own husband. It would no
more occur to her to do such an auda
cious thing than to have chosen the name
given her at birth. An interested friend
of the family, known as a "go-between,"
attends to this matter.
When a girl reaches a marriayeabla ace
this "go-between" casts about for a hus
band for her. When he fldds a young
man who meets all of the requirements
of the family and fortune he arranges for
a meeting with the girl and her mother.
Another way ia to arrange for a meet
ing at the house of a friend. Of course,
the matchmaker will pretend that It Is
quite by accident, although all of tha
party understand perfectly that It Is by
design. , f ; âÂ¦ r
The girl is very shy and hlde^her face
behind her fan as she bows low many
times. Then she retires, blushing and
nervous, behind her m&ther. The young
man at this meeting locks her over and
decides whether he will wed her. If he
agrees, the negotiations are carried to a
finish. He pays for the trousseau and the
bride's father provides the entire fur
nishings for the house which the newly
married pair will occupy.
body had the craze and adopted a fright
fully ugly length. Its only recommenda
tion was that it was truly comfortable.
But just because the French failed to see
anything artistic in it and it continued to
trail a foot or more behind them the craze
lost its sudden popularity.
And let me whisper something into your
ear right here. Look at a French woman,
or, for that matter, a woman who is ab
solutely chic. Look at her hard and see
wherein she differs from yourself. She
does, and if you are clever enough to dis
cover exactly what makes the change,
you may copy after her in the twinkling
of an eye and with practically no ex
pense.
Notice that her skirt fits tightly about
the hips. It does not bag about the knees
and it does not flare much about the feet.
And it Is not all In the cut by any means.
The secret is thisâ she. does not wear
starched petticoats nor silk ones for that
matter. If she is compelled to wear one
at all the softest silk that she can .pos
sibly find will be her selection. A surah
or a Chinaâ anything that one can hold
In the palm of the hand and still have
room to spare.
When she turns about her gown will
cling and the lines of her figure will
show to the best advantage. Her skirt
is long enough to cover her feet complete
ly, but when she raises it at a crossing
no color is visible. Such dressing Is an
art and it requires study.
But how does she do this? you ask. It
is simple enough. You have seen woolen
tights, but probably thought they were
meant only for an actressâ that is, if you
thought at all. But such is not the case.
They are clinging and delightfully warm
and answer to^ all intents and purposes.
If the skirt is" lined with silk, or better
still, is made with a drop skirt, what is
the earthly use of carrying about any
more clothing, especially when one looks
a hundred per cent better for it?
And that reasoning comes in to. good
advantage with such a frock as a gradu
ation one would necessarily be. Let there
be ample fullness about the feetâ the more
the better, but that can easily be supplied
from the knees down and still give that
clinging appearance that is absolutely all
the rage.
And the waist. Almost always they are
madeÂ»with a yoke, but some wise people
have two of them made for the one skirt
and then their ingenuity must work to
the very best advantage. A smart one,
however. Is made with a very low yoke
effect. There are clusters of tucks in the
lawn and then a row of the insertion and
that way all about the waist, front and
back. Instead of ruffles to take the bare
ness away, a piece of the insertion is
laid on, but not put on in a full fashion
in the slightest. The zigzags fit in pret
tily and, besides, there is not that com-
taffeta, or something that Is rather stiff,
something that is white, and at the same
time that will not look coarse, is dainty
when edged with Valenciennes lace. Ruf
fle after ruffle is put on, and just as
clo3ely together as possible in order to
make them stand out prettily. *The true
way to appreciate what a difference it
makes is to try one waist with and one
without the ruffles and see which you
really like the better. The great conso
lation is that it takes only about half an
hotir!to put them in and your waist lines
will be Just alike when it comes to fluff.
wnile tney are smart tney will not an
sv-er the purpose any better than" the
darker ones, as the main idea is to keep
strictly to all white.
White stockings, by the way, are com
ing in more attractive forms than they
used to. The plain hose or the drop
stitch were the only ones buyable, but
to-day you may choose from any number
of boxes, and finally go home with as
elaborate a pair as you may like or your
pocketbook will allow. On account of
the summer girl suddenly taking it into
her head to wear white the price has
gone way up, and it may hurt to pay a
fancy price for something that will not
be worn commonlyâ so you think; but
take them away with you on your vaca
tion, and you will not begrudge the money
put into them.
And another thing to consider: That 13

/ / That-iSme of all times when a girl
wY thinks" she is all-important and
quite-' grown up. Her skirt is long
. and in. many cases has a beautiful
train that trails about in a delightful
fashion after, her.
In other wbrds she is a young lady
fully out of the detested schoolroom. She
may come and go to all sorts of enter
tainments and not hear those words that
have been her nightmare for years: "No
girl who is not out of school should do
that." At last the much-dreamed-of time
is at hand. She is on the ragged verge
of "coming out." After that one night
when she dons her new Trock she may
not be shut up in a stuffy room and left
to pore over Latin when sister is spinning
in the park. No, life is just" com
mencingâ so the graduating girl fancies.
"But, what to wear?" is the next ques
tion. Something not too much grown up
yet something that will speak for itself.
Certainly not a silk nor yet a cashmere.
Something that will be fresh and girlish,
but very, very dainty withal. Something
that will be appropriate for the occasion
and yet not too commonplace.
A soft silk mull is one of the nicest
things that can be suggested, but that
material requires the finest of trimmings
end yards of it. The very softness makes
it clinging and exquisite, but In some in
stances it Is by far too expensive, as all
the findings must be of the best buyable
quality. The entire effect of the gown is
ruined if a taffeta lining is not forthcom
ing, and it is also utterly spoiled If the
Â¦ilk Is not the exact shade. The mull is
seldom a pure white and it is not nearly
as pretty when it is. More frequently it
Is a delicate cream or has the faintest
tint of yellow. When such is the case
the silk must be a deep cream to carry
out the tone. So, you see, unless your
nibdiste is one of the very smartest she
nine times out of ten will make a bobble
of your materials and all that will be left
to say Is "It might have been."
If you want to be a little unlike others,
a very little, you may choose white ba

you are very apt to be just enough un
like others to have stepped over the
boundary and reached the ridiculous side
of it.

fully the various kinds of automobiles, is
finely illustrated and contains a glossary

"The Brook Book" is making its timely
appearance from the press of Doubleday,
Page & Co', with many beautiful illustra
tions. In it Mary Rogers Miller under
takes to give a first acquaintance with all
sorts of wild life and things that exist
or center their life In and about the
streams of forest and meadow. The nar
rative begins with May and follows the
changing year with tho never ending va
riety and fascination of real out-door life.
Tho book consists of three parts: Part
1â The accession and proclamation, etc.,
of the King, including various impor
tant matters incident to the first year of
his Majesty's reign. Part 2â The gra.nd
event of the coronation itself. Part 3 â
The rite and ceremony in' St. Peter's Ab
bey Church of Westminster. The author,
Charles Eyre ' Pascoe, predicts that the
old form as practiced in 1838 will be fol
lowed as nearly as possible. This is add
ed in a fourth part. or appendix to the
volume, in which is given "The Form and
Order of the, Service and Ceremonies Ob
served in the Coronations in the Abbey
Church of St. Peter, Westminster." The
price of the book is $1 40. .
A most timely book has just come to
us frcm the press of . D. Appleton & Co.,
New Yorkâ "The Pageant and Ceremony
of the Coronation of Their Majesties
King Edward the Seventh and Queen
Alexandra*' The volume will be found
equally valuable to those who are fortu
nate enough to see the coronation and to
those who must content themselves with
written accounts, for it forrns a complete
compendium of the coronation rites and
ceremonies and state pageant. The
author has had unusual* facilities for
making it authoritative, so it will prove
quite valuable as a handy work of refer
ence. The colored illustrations will be
found especially "useful in giving the
proper idea of the regalia. \
The Coronation.
James B. Connolly, the son of a New
England skipper, who went to the Greek
sames and won a first prize, will have an
other of his graphic sea sketches in the
June Scribner's, this one describing a trip
"On a Baltic Sea Sloop." Mr. Connolly
has now pictured the three great groups
of rishermenâ Gloucester, North Sea and
Baltic.
Literary Notes.
"All but Jimmy Powers. . He stopped
short in his tracks and threw his battered
"Jimmy Powers, Archie Harris, Long
Pine Jim, Big Nolan and Mike . Maloney,
the brother of Bryan, were in the worst
case. They were, as has been 'said, en
gaged in "flattening* part of the Jam about
eight or ten rods below the face of : it.
When they finally understood that the"*
affair was one of escape, they ran toward
the jam, hoping to climb out. Then the
crash came. They heard the roar of the
waters, the wrecking of the timbers, they
saw the logs bulge outward In anticipa
tion of the. break. Immediately they
turned and fled, they knew 'not .where.
"Scotty Parsons, Jack Hyland, Red
Jacket and the forty or fifty top men had
reached the shore. By the wriggling ac
tivity 'which is a riverman's alone, they
succeeded in pulling themselves beyond
the snap of death's jaw. It was a narrow
thing for most of them and a miracle for
some. . .-.- '
"Then the flood hit square. It was the
impact of Irresistible power. A great
sheet of water rose like surf from the
tail of the jam; a mighty cataract poured
down over its surface, lifting the free
logs; from either wing timbers crunched,
split, rose suddenly into wracked promi
nenceV twisted beyond the semblance of
themselves. Here and there single logs
were even projected bodily upward, as an
apple seed is shot from between the
thumb and forefinger. Â¦ Then the jam
moved. \ '
"Even in the railroad rush of those few
moments several things happened. Thorpe
leaped for a rope. The crew working on
top of the jam ducked instinctively to
right and left and began to scramble to
ward safety. The men below, at first be
wildered and not comprehending, finally
understood, and ran toward the face of
the jam with ihe intention of clambering
up it. There would be no escape in the
narrow canyon below, the walls of which
rose sheer.
Down the bed of the stream from the
upper bend rushed a solid wall of water
several feet, high.- It flung itself forward
with the headlong impetus of a cascade.
Even In the short interval between the
visitor's exclamation and Carpenter's
rapid gesture, it had loomed -in sight,
twisted a dozen trees from the river bank
and foamed into the entrance of the gorge.
An instant later it collided with the tall
of the jam.
Below we give an excerpt from Stewart
Edward White's latest story, "The Blazed
Trail." In it is described the bunting of
a log jam and it is a fine example of the
forceful writing in which Mr. White
shows himself such an adept. This novel,
published by McClure, Phillips & Co., New
York, is one of the remarkable books of
the year. It gives a splendid picture of
frontier life: the struggles of the pioneer
woodsman in the forest
Aside from the attraction in the general
character of the work there is the added
interest of a single strong theme in the
adventures of Harry Thorpe. Young
Thorpe suffers from, a visitation of the
sins of the father upon the son. He has
been driven from civilization to a life in
the wilderness to seek seclusion where the
fact of his father's crime of embezzlement
has not reached. It is the usual 'story of
perseverance finally crowned with suc
cess; but so well told that it* comes to
the reader as a field refreshingly Â«ew.
Here is the selection from it mentioned
above: .

The major part of the story is laid In
the State capital and among politicians.
The author is at home there, having had
extensive experience as a member of the'
New York State Legislature. The plot is
well-defined and sustained to the end. It
has many dramatic situations. The inner'
workings of .the "machine" are clearly
depicted. (Published by the Lothrop Pub

"Margaret Bowlby," by Edgar L. Vin
cent, might well be named "The Politi
cian," for while it is a story of love it is
also a story of politics. The hero, Robert
Kemp, is a young mine superintendent,
who has grown up from poverty. He is
eager to improve the condition of his men,
and, seeking a nomination for the lower
house of the Legislature, is beaten in
caucus by his employer,. Captain Bowlby,
the owner of the mine. Captain Bowlby
has a daughter, Margaret, who Is in love
with Kemp, and, out of sympathy with
him for his defeat, secures Robert's nomi

ert succeeds in defeating the machine, and
leads a fight against it for the election
of United States Senator. It is a long,
hard struggle. The machine men get hold
of : Captain | Bowlby and cajole him into
supporting the machine candidate. Money
is brought Into use, and a trap is laid for

To quote from the preface of Mr. Pat
rick will give us an Idea more directly
concerning this first volume Just issued:
Judging from the character of the first
volume, if the two that are to follow keep
to the standard made by their predecessor,
the set will prove an invaluable one. The
selections are all of the very best, and be
sides Illustrating the work of the writer
under consideration are in general worth
many readings Tor themselves; so these
books fehould really constitute a library.
Of course in a work of this kind it can
not be nor is it the intention to give, a
perfect knowledge of the author under
discussion. This encyclopedia is, as it
were, a finger post to point out the av
erage achievement of the man, to â¢ give
his weak points as well as his good, and
also to direct a line of reading*that will
form an acquaintance with the least pos
sible waste of time or energy.
It is now sixty years since Dr. Chambers
began work on the first, and many things
have happened in the world of letters. In
the present edition, of which this volume
is the first to appear, it is announced that
the essential plan will be retained, but In
a more broadened and perfected way.
As time advances tue need for a guide
and help becomes more and more neces
sary; such a one was devised and suc
cessfully carried into effect when Dr.
Robert Chambers compiled a "Cyclopae
dia of English Literature," the first of
its kind in Britain. The plan for this was
laid In 1S41, and Dr. Chambers was as
sisted by his friend Dr. Robert Carruth
ers of Inverness. The work appeared .;n
two volumes in 1844 and was brought
down to date and reprinted in 1858. It was
revised and extended under the charge of
Dr. Carruthers in 1876; and a fourth re
issue, again incorporating new matter,
took place a dozen years. later. But a
keener interest in the older literature and
a fuller knowledge of It, new facts, new
theories and new light on a thousand
pcints, the increasing supply of new ma
terials for selection, the continued activ
ity of accepted authors, the rise of new
and brilliant stars, and all that is im
plied In the unabated continuity of the
literary life of the nation, have rendered
necessary a . much more thoroughgoing
revision and reconstruction. This new
edition Is Intended to supply this want.
There is no doubt that English literature
has accomplished more than the sword or
the machine, and, covering as it does a
period of over 1400 years, it is no
email task to familiarize ourselves with
even the flower of it; still, considering
relative importance it is a study that is
deserving of the deepest attention.

The Smart Set for June opens with a
novelette by Gertrude Lynch, entitled
"The Fighting Chance." This story is Â»a
Interesting as It is valuable It presents
a vivid picture of a phase In the Ufa Â©1
an honest statesman, and the theme ia
treated with great skill by an author
whose personal experiences enable her to
write luminously of department llf* In
Washington. The love interest in the
story Is fascinating, while the plot Is ab
solutely distinctive, as original as It is
satisfying. Beyond all this there Is the
charm of very clever dialogue which per
meates the novelette.
The short stories axÂ© of great varJ-rt^/
but all very human and all of thÂ« jj&t
literary standard. A notable story of tha
most romantic type Is "The Tree cf
Love,'* by Justus Miles Forman; "An In
discreet Divorce," by Walter E. Grogan,
Is a most diverting bit of humor, whils
"Madame Bo-Peep of the Ranches," by O.
Henry, Is a pure love story, altogether
delightful; there Is also a most striking
Btory by John Regnault Ellyson, entitled
"A Swirl of Dust." Caroline Duer con
tributes a remarkably clever play in one
act, "Mr. Shakespeare at School," an!
there are articles that entertain and in
form in equal measure: "The Troubles of
the Prince," by Alfied Henry Lewis, and
"The Power of Woman," by Henry Col

The late Frank R. Stockton, replying to
a correspondent who criticized his last
novel, "Kate- Bonnet," said:
Mr. Irwin's "Love Sonnets of a Hood
lum," that was published some time ago,
made a great hit both here and in the
East, but It requires no prophet to fore
tell the popularity of Omar Khayyam Jr.
Here is a verse from Omar:
Upw with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,
A flask of wine, & book of verse â and thou
F. ; k> me Fir.ging In the wilderness â
And wilderness Is paradise enow.
Xow comes Omar. Jr. with the follow
ing:
A grand piano underneath the bough,
A CTarnaphone. a Chinese gong, and thou
Tryir.g to sing an anthem off the key â
Oh, paradise were wilderness enow!
It is quite Interesting in this connection
to compare the work of Omar Jr. with
that of Omar the old. Mr. Irwin takes
the original verse and gives a twist here
end a twist there, keeping the meter,
sometimes a line or two, sometimes the
sense for a while, and then, presto! a new
Etanza .is turned out that pleases the
fancy mightily andâ you read on to the
next. i-v â¢
Mr. Irwin's verses have all the zip and
go to them of perfect spontaneity, and
yet If you take the time and thought to
examine them you will Bee that they
were written with the greatest care and
painstaking. "Easy reading is generally
hard writing."
"While the Volcanic Singer was seated
one day in the shade of a banyan tree,
fresh cigars and abandoned stumps sur
rounding him like the little hills that
climb the mountain, he nodded and fell
â¢usleep. still puffing lustily at a panatella,
sweet end black. Now the poet's beard
was long and his 6leep deep, and as the
treed grevr shorter with each ecstatic
puff the little brand of fire drew closer
end closer to the beautiful hairy mantle
that fell from the poet's chin. That day
the Island was wrapped In a light gauze
cf blue mist, an exotic smoke that was a
blessing to the nostrils. It suffused the
whole island from end to end and re
minded the happy Inhabitants of the
cigars of Nirvana, grown in some Planta
tion of the Blessed. When the smoke
had Â» passed and our heads were cleared
of tb* narcotic fumes we hastened to the
spot where our good master had loved to
tit; but there naught remained but a
great heap of white ashes sitting among
the pipes and cigars that had Inspired his
ecr.g. Thus he died as he lived, an an
cient smoker."
The end of Omar Jr., as described in the
Introduction, is as beautiful as he could
himself have wished.
"Borneo was the island to which the poet
fled, and here the historian finds him
some years later prospering In the world's
poeds and greatly reverenced by the in
habitants. Although Omar Jr. was un
doubtedly the greatest man that Borneo
has yet produced, he must not be con
fused In the mind of the reader with the
Wild Man of Borneo, who, although him
eelf a poet, was a man of far less culture
than the author of the present Rubai
yat."
Omar Jr. Is a Jolly Cog, whose phil
osophy of life comes to him through the
bluish mist of tobacco smoke as he sits
back in his easy chair and courts the
Goddess Nicotine.
Read a little of the Introduction and
meet the young Omar through his his
torian:
"Omar Khayyam died in the early part
of the eleventh century, having sold his
poems profitably, with the proceeds of
which he established taverns throughout
the length and breadth of Persia. Omar
died in the height of his popularity, but
shortly after his death the city of Nai
shapur became a temperance town. Even
yet the younger Omar might have lived
and sung at Naishapur had not a fanatical
sect of Sufi women, taking advantage of
the increasing respectability of the once
jovial city, risen in a body against the
house of Omar and literally razed it to
the ground with the aid of hatchets,
Â¦which were at that time the peculiar
weapon of the sex and sect. It is said
that the younger Omar, who was then a
youth, was obliged to flee from the wrath
of the Good Government Propagandists
and to take abode in a distant city. For
some time he wandered about Persia in
a destitute condition, plying the heredi
tary trade of tentmaker, but at length
poverty compelled him to quit his native
country for good and to try his fortunes
in a land so remote that the dissolute
record of his parent could no longer
hound him.
Mr. Irwin brings out his verses with all
the pompous seriousness of a clever
humorist He Â¦writes an Introduction to
the poems narrating In learned style the
story of the discovery of the manuscript
of Omar Khayyam Jr., and giving a criti
cism of the verses themselves. Consid
ering the introduction and the notes which
have been added to clear away the fog:
of abstruse passages It Is hard to tell
which la the better humor, the verses or
their explanationâ fortunately we are wel
com* to both, for one would not be com
plete without the other.
This edition, that will be placed upon
the market to-morrow. Is very attractively
and appropriately bound and the Illustra
tions are In that quaint style that mark
the efforts of Oelett Burgess.
There have been imitations of the Ru
baiyat time without numberâ Mr. Wal
lace Irwin's work, however, is not an
Imitation, but to the contrary It la quite
origins.!.
that if old Omar could have
looked from his garden seat down through
the vista of ages and studied the "Junior"
he would have enjoyed it just as fully
as it will be enjoyed by the people of
to-day. It is Just that kind of a produc
tion. Entirely aside from the laughable
humor of the present verses there is really
a lot of good philosophy- of the practical
sort to be gathered from the lines.
WALLACE IRWIN has surpassed
himself in his latest book of
verses. "The Rubaiyat of Omar
Khayyam Junior." I think
whose article on the subject appears in
the Youth's Companion for May 15. Stand
ing in his own right at the head of thÂ«
Scottish aristocracy, brother-in-law of
King Edward through marriage with the
Princess Louise, familiar by reason of fiv.i
years in the Governor Generalship of Can
ada with the American point of view, he
not only has a firm grasp of facts, but
sees their significance to the American
public.

Crosby takes the subject of war as a tar

very telling hits in more than one in

If I am mistakenâ if he Is really guilty
he Is the most consummate scoundrel in
the world. But we cannot give up the
fight for his soulâ no, not even if he Is
proved guiltyâ while it i3 possible to con
vert him to Christianity.
"Kins 13 a consummate scoundrel," an
swers the Rev. Mr. Rader. "He Is a crim
inal because he Is proud to be a criminal
He told me himself that he had conceived
the idea while serving his last sentence in
prison of committing wholesale burglaries
under the cloak of religious zeal
as soon as he was released. He
even boasted, 'I committed sixty bur
glaries In" sixty days before they sent me
to the penitentiary last time, and I'm' as
proud of it as you are of your sermons.'
It is King's very boldness that makes
mm so dangerous. The robbery at the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union
shows how he carried out bis scheme. I
nave been speaking against him wherever
and whenever I could."
j., lt !l L the robbery at the Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union which the police
declare best Illustrates King's newly con
ceived methods, which were to locate the
easiest places to plunder while lecturina
and then send the members of his gang tc
carry off the swag while he posed as a
reformed saint.
As the police explain It, King went to
the Woman's Christian Temperance - Un
ion several times and was kindly treated
by the ladies in charge. One day he called
with Hamilton, whom the police say is
one of the worst all-round crooks in the
State, and later Mrs. Spencer's trunk was

"However, I'm' dead, socially, no matter,
how the case goes. I couldn't do anything

members of the union, believes King ia
innocent, but Mrs. | Bradley and Mrs.
Spencer have both testified for the prose
cution. .' Â¦â¢ â¢
"King is innocent. Of* that I am sure,"
replies the Rev. Mr. Ford, "because I be
lieve he is sincere in his reformation. He
was invaluable in his work among- crim
inals, for he knew their mind and their
ways and \rzr? best to reach them. As
proof of his sincerity I know â personally
knowâ of cases vrhere he spent his last
es>rit to feed and clothe hungry and home
less convicts, while he himself is still
wearing the suit of clothes given him
Â¦when he was discharged from San Quen
tin. He was indiscreet in going among
criminals agrain. Indeed he was warned
against such a course, but he was striv
ing earnestly to save others. Why, if
he was not sincere, why didn't he use
the sympathies of the church.- to his own
advancement? I know there were glaring
inconsistencies in his speeches, but I set
"Thieves never reform," says Captain
of Defectives Seymour. "Whenever one of
them professes religious reformation in
the spectacular Way that King did, we
always watch him the more closely, and
it is only a question of time when he
is caught red handed and landed in pris
on again. And, strange as it may seem,
for all that King is bold, clever, master
ful and resourceful, the crimes for which
he has been convicted have all been triv
ial. The wonder is that he could risk Â¦ so
much for so little. He is scarcely out of
the penitentiary before he is back again.
He was sentenced to Folsom first in 1895
for burglary, and released on February
4, 1S9S. Three months later he was again
caught after a petty theft, convicted and
sentenced to San Quentin. Only four
months passed since his release last De
cember before he was again caught in
the midst of plunder and lodged in jail.
Other criminals may reform, but burglars
â never!"
"And as for being dangerous, why.
there wasn't a knife or a pistol found
among the whole crowd. King has never
professed to be an evangelist. His lec
turing was all done for the California
Prison Commission, and ended only ten
days before his arrest. In that ten days
lies whatever doubt can be cast upon
him, but I am sure he has reformed. If
Judge Mogan thinks he is not guilty we
will employ the best lawyers in the city
to defend him.
.what motive could King have for stealing
such baubles? He had all the backing he
wanted to enable him to lead an honest
life. He went to the house where he was
caught to arrange with Barker, whom ha
had known in San Quentin, to start a
chicken ranch, and some charitable ladiea,
whose names I am not free to mention,
had promised to supply/ him with incu
bators and other things necessary for the
enterprise.
â¢There ;sn"t the slightest doubt of
King's-- suiit." declares Chief of Police
'Vittman with emphasis. "He was not
only caught in the house with the plun
titr. b'Jt the two women who were caught
The police, however, have thrust aside
all consideration of spiritual ethics and,
iolloy.-irig the straight and narrow path of
rriminoiogy. are reasoning: from cause to
effect TÂ«ith King's past record as a basis
tnd at cumulating evidence to send him to
prison for Mfe.
And over this question of his guilt or in
nocence some of the most prominent di
vines in California have taken issue. The
Rev. Mr. Ford represents one extreme
that believes explicitly in King's com
plete conversion. The Rev. Mr. Rader
voices the opinion of the opposite ex
treme, who are convinced that King has
been boldly masquerading under an as
sumed contrition' and is therefore doubly
oangercus as a thief.
In the four months that elapsed be
tween those two portentous events the
police declare he concocted and partly
executed one of the most daring schemes
of robbery ever devised in California. It
was nothing short of wholesale theft at
the head of an organized gang under the
cloak of religious reformation.
On the other hand, Charles Montgom
ery, the millionaire- philanthropist and
president of the California Prison Com
mission; Rev. Frank S. Ford of the First
Christian Church, Mrs. Luse of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union
and many other prominent people con
nected with religious and reformatory in
stitutions are stanch in his defense and
declare that in his present trouble King
Is simply the victim of his own spiritual
zeal in attempting to reform other crim
inals who were in San Quentin with him,
but who have been active in their chosen
profession ever since leaving the peniten
tiary. There were four others arrested
"Â»1th King, but the amount of plunder in
volved is not worth five dollars. It is,
therefore.- a battle royal between the
church for the soul of one reclaimed, who
is falsely accused, and the State for the
principle of good government against a
convict who hae not only lapsed into his
old habits, but led others into crime.
Just a month ago he was again locked
up behind prison bars at the Hall of Jus
tioÂ», charged with the same crime.
YT OE KING, the "Preacher Convict,"
1 is the most remarkable criminal in
\ all the West just at present.
QJ On December 29, 1301. he was dis
charged from San Quentln after
serving a. five-year sentence for
burglary. Â»
But for all the triviality of the plunder,
the story of. the capture of King and the
four others with .him reads like a chap
ter from Sherlock Holmes. Many bur
glaries were bein^ committed, but the po
lice could not locate the criminals whose
operations grew more extensive every
month, though they never succeeded In
making a large haul in any of their raids.

"We are having, always have had and

Every man Is of the spirit of the age in
which he is raised, and by our theological
notions, false standards and cruel meth
ods we have made it very easy for men
to do wrong and very hard for them to
do right. Every man is indirectly respon
sible for the condition of every other
man; this is an indisputable fact, for
the 'brotherhood of the race is a fact In
nature, and we are all Integral links in
a chain of cause and effect that stretches
from eternity to eternity and binds the
past with the Infinite present. This asser
tion rests for Individual support upon
the twin pillars of science and religion.
"We have been praying for the last 2000
years, 'Father, thy will be done on earth
as it- is in heaven." That the answer haa
been so long delayed is only seeming.
When man catches the-tdea that every
bcuI is a single thread in the warp and
wcof of the vast fabric of human prog
ress; when he begins to realize that the
responsibility of human progress rests tm
human shoulders, and when every child
born into the world has an e<iuai oppor
tunity to be good, then that prayer will
have been answered.
"This dogma of despiar, 'Once a con
vict always- a convict' is as unjust as it
is untrue.
"Those there are who will pronounce all
talk of human treatment of this class as
a waste of sentiment. They say thesÂ«s
fellows are beyond recallâ they are abnor
mal creatures. Once a criminal always a
criminal. The reclamation of this class
is a function of Government, and is out
side the scope of individual responsibility.
"Such assertions are ill considered; for
wherever any organized effort has been
made in assisting discharged prisoners it
haa always returned gratifying results.
Babbl Levy, who meets all Jewish pris
oners at the gate, informed mÂ« that not a
single Jew had ever returned to prison.
"Mr. Charles Montgomery, the" philan
thropist, who has devoted hi3 life to tha
prisoners, claims that nearly half of the
men could be reclaimed. Personally I
know of many who have settled down and
through their honesty and industry have
won the confidence of those about them
and are a* credit to the community in
which they reside.
"The unfortunate 'politician who hap
pens to get the appointment of Warden
for four years is not responsible for the
condition of our prisons; it is the method
or system. Men are sent there for fixed
and unconditional sentences, which is
without consistency or justification, be
cause one man will get one year for a
given offense, while the next man will get
forty years. If the avowed purpose in
sending men to prison i3 reformation,
how Is the Judge to determine when this
man will reform? Consequently Instead
of making the sentence for the man they
endeavor to make it fit the crime. Every
man convicted of a felony should be sen
tenced for life, and when he haa shown
by his conduct and character that he la
worthy and capable of taking part in the
affairs of men let him out on probation.
"It was stated at the last prison con
ference, that you might as wen send a
boy to the pesthouse for the toothache
as to send him to prison for the purpose
of reforming. We often hear some one
say, 'Ob, yes, a year or so over there will
do Johnny good." If they were to say a
year or so over there, and Johnny wllj
never be any good, they would be neare;
the truth. Th* old and the young, the
black and the white, the hardened ol
fender and the novitiate are all thrown
indiscriminately together, and teach a con
dition cannot but be productive of evil
results, i don't care how pure the bay
may be, he will leave prison with con
tagion he did not take in with him, for ha
cannot help but assimilate some of tha
Infectious moral germs rampant in sucb
an environment.
"In tha first place we would do well to
remind ourselves that all men in prison
are not criminals. A great majority of
them are young men. who through' want,
temptation, opportunity or drink, have, we
might say, inadvertently wandered into
prison. But taking them as airhole, I would
say that the effect is bad, very bad. Our
ablest authorities upon penology admit
that our prisons fail of their purpose, in
asmuch as they do not accomplish the
desired result, i. e., the reformation of the
criminal and the protection of society. Of
course society is protected while the
man Is In prison, but "when he leaves he

they kept him under surveillance as much
as possible. He entered into his new
work with a zest. The pictures, on this
page for which he posed to illustrate his
sermons when he first appeared in the
pulpit last January show the startling
contrasts in his career. Before the cam
era he showed how Quickly he could/
transform himself from a pulpit orator
to a burglarâ "the genuine second-story
worker," as he was pleased to identify
the characterâ by simply tying a blaclc
handkerchief over his face, turning up hU
coat collar and pulling down the brim of
his soft felt hat. The metamorphosis was
terrifylngly complete and convincing.
About two months ago the burglaries
became most numerous, and the police
were ordered to take extra precautions.
Thus matters stood when one night Po
liceman H. B. Braig saw two women on
Geary street wearing raglans that fitted
the description of property stolen in a
recent burglary. The identification was
complete enough to justify instant arrest,
but Braig shrewdly suspecting that the
two women were only part of the gang,
risked the chance of losing all of them
by shadowing them along the brightly
lighted streets, attired as he was in full
uniform.
The developments of the next few min
utes proved that Braig was right in his
suspicions. The two women were joined
by two men and the chase led down Powell
street and by devious ways south of
Market street, to tha house at 835A How
ard street, which the whole party entered
by a rear door on Tehama street.
Feeling sure of his quarry now. Braig
did not take any chance of losing them
by trying to win the glory of a lone
handed arrest. He called Policemen T. C.
Murphy, C. D. Staples. C. F. Skelly and
E. W. Eskew, and had them keep thÂ«
house surrounded while he entered the
place.
As he had expected, there was a wild
rush to escape as soon as he knocked on
the door, but no matter which way Kins.
Barker and his wife and sister turned,
they were confronted by a policeman
armed and waiting. After all four were
handcuffed, the house was searched and
the plunder of several burglaries wua
found concealed In one of the rooms-
Later, Hamilton, in scanty attire was
caught as he tried to escape from a closet.
With these arrests the Ions series at
burglaries ceased, and now the cas<9 awaits
upon the final trial to prove which is
rightâ the church or the state. â¢
So far as the difference in opinion in
the church goes, however. King in his
sermon wrought Ingeniously in his own
defense. In on* of his sermons be said:

interrupted by the applause of the as
sembled Students. She said in closing:
Seniors are thought to appreciate most high
ly their own feRrivities. but in this we are
greatly handicapped. It is not possible for us
to ignore altogether the fact that this week Is
the laÂ«t of our college life â a life which has
many pleasant, as well as unpleasant, associa
tions connected with It. During these few days
that are lett we must bid a lingering farewell
to all the old familiar places about which ao
many pleasant memories have grown up. We
must also say good-by to professors and in
structors and to our closest friends and associ
ates. Our impressions of Stanford University
as we shall leave it have been given up by these
people, and it Is with rtgret that we shall leave
them. But we have every confidence in- the
future of our alma, mater and we are glad to
know that the men to whom this future is In
trusted are worthy of that confidence.

To-night the senior reception occurred
in Encina Hall. The pleasure of the even-
Ing was marred by the refusal of Man

to be used for dancing. Lathrop has fur
ther decreed that the senior bal\ on Mon
day night shall not last after 12 o'clock,
if given in Encina.-' The students." partic
ularly the seniors,, are very indignant at
this action. It has .been customary here
tofore for the senior ball to last past the
midnight hour. The ball committee will
decide either on giving the dance in San

early hour of 6 o'clock. Probably the
latter course will be adopted. â¢

PORTERVILLE'S WELCOME.
At Porterville the party was met > by

J. W. Davis, E. L.. Scott. A. S.. Mapes,
The excursion car, which had been run
down from Exeter, was freighted with
bouquets by the women of Lindsnv. A.t
4 o'clock the train left for Porterville, the
visitors giving three cheers for their
Lindsay hosts.
The early hours of the afternoon were
spent in a drive to the groves south of
Lindsay. A visit was paid t.5 the pumping
plant of the Lindsay Water Development
Company and the 'strangers saw a stream
of water. SO.000 gallons per hour in vol
ume, gushing forth from the well's 12-inch
pipe, electricity being the lifting power.
Measured in other/ terms, the stream's
volume was about 157 miner's inches. A
hundred miner's inches is sufficient here
to Irrigate BOO acres, v '
The Lindsay citizens were ready for the
excursionists when the carriages arrived.
Among those who helped make the visit
pleasant were Charles J. Carle, H; W.
Dockham. George F. Whltmore, Dwfght
Whitmore, Basil. Prior and. R. M. Gra
ham. Luncheon was served in the hotel,
the dining room of which was a bower of
blossoms. A short speech of welcome was
made by II. W. Dockham, Pditor of the
Lindsay Gazette, and A. H. Vail respond
ed, relating a few stories for which Gen
eral Barnes has begun to apologize and
expressing the appreciation of the visitors
for the reception accorded them.

The citrus industry around Exeter and
I.lndeay ; is on an immense scale that
st&ggers one who, is familiar with ,the
five, ten and forty acre orange groves of
Southern California. The notable sight
of the morning's drive was 'the Bonnio
brae tract, two miles from Exeter. Here
700 acres, of citrus fruits, mainly oranges,
ar<5 growing. All belong to large owners.
Three hundred and twenty acres aro
owned by the Merrimans, the millionaire
lumbermen- of "Wisconsin. The groves
skirt around the sides and extend over the
top of a ridge that stretches out into the
valley, shutting off Round Valley from
the plain. The drive led over this hill,
and the view from the ranch houses, at
the summit held the excursionists spell

Starting from Exeter about 8 o'clock,
the excursionists were given a twenty

at Lindsay. The latter town is but seven
miles from Exeter, but the route taken
wound southeastward, in and out along
the hills, where the fringe of orange
groves is being* widened and lengthened

see near to them in time the realization

Kyle testified that out of 110 requisitions

Fitzgerald Informed the board that he
had instructed Clerk Smith to prepare a
tabulated list of the principal articles of
food used In both prisons. Smith was
called upon to testify, and said that he
had received from the commissary of
Folsom data as to the amount of food
consumed by the prisoners during the
last year of Warden -Aull's administra

consumption during the presjnt adminis

placed In evidence, showed that every
prisoner In Folsom received/' thirty-nine

prisoners in San Quentin, and the di

SOME FORMS. OF TORTURE.
Captain Murphy, a stout, florid com
plexioned little man, was called to testify
about the methods of punishment in
vogue in- the prispn. He admitted having
"triced up" a prisoner and also admitted
that there were several offenders who
claimed to have been crippled by being
put into a strait jacket. Captain Murphy
explained' the solitary confinement
process, and ended his testimony by say
ing that all processes of punishment were
carried on. under the supervision of the
prison surgeon. Murphy was disposed to
make his explanations as mild as pos
sible. He was not pressed for explicit
answers as to the result of his methods
under Wilkinson's orders.
Major Kyle was asked to compile a
table showing the amount of clothing fur

What has Warden Aguirre done with
dozens of napkins and doylies in a home
which is that of a bachelor? The Call will
explain this later.
Can Warden Aguirre explain how it
happens that he has enough towels
charged to his house to give him one new
towel per day and dozens of officers and
guards have had buf a little more than
half his. supply?
In the past fifteen months Levl Strauss

proposition. '

head, of which Governor Gage is the bene
ficiary.
â¢ The Call will furnish the people of the
State of California with further proof
of the criminal acts of the San Quentin
Will Furnish Proof.
Governor Gage and his family have been
frequent residents at the Warden's home,
and they have been the beneficiaries of
stolen property. They have, including
Governor Gage, slept on sheets obtained
by.fraud and forgery; slept in night robes
filched from the State and obtained by
forgery and fraud; eaten food stolen from
the public stores and charged to prison
departments and sidewalk repairs, and
quaffed costly wines secured by the aid
of convicts in a felonious manner.
Warden Aguirre, who is a single man,
certainly had no use personally for the
property obtained last year by felonious
acts. The law allows him a salary and
the sum of $100 per month for subsistence.
Food supplies, wearing apparel, household
goods, etc., have been secured by forgery
and fraud by the San Quentin ring and

The articles of incorporation have not
been filed because the principal Â¦ place of
business, which must be stated, has not
been decided upon.
A remarkable feature of the organiza
tion is the fact that nearly every railroad
owner or promoter in the State is a stock
holder and not one of them has given an
inkling of the formation of the enormous
enterprise.
For more than a month the formation
of the company has been under way, !but
the plans have been kept- secret; owing
to the fact that Henry E. Huntington is
holding out for Los Angeles and .D. O.
Mills wants the plant to be installed in
San Francisco. Ten days ago it was
practically decided that it should go to
the Northern metropolis, but Mr. Hunt
ington remained loyal to Los Angeles and
has succeeded in inducing Mr. Mills to
look more kindly upon this city. To a
large extent the railroad competition here
is supporting- his plea.
The heaviest stockholders are Henry
E. Huntineton of Los Angeles and D. O.
Mills of New York, and every share in

SAN JOSE, May 23. 1002.â To the- Members
of the California Cured Fruit Association
Gentlemen: This is a special communication
published through the courtesy of the press of
the State, to each member of the California
Cured Fruit Association by the members' com
mittee of eleven, appointed at the mass-meet
ing of members â¢ of the association, held im
mediately after .the nominating convention
May 2, 1902. to discuss and consider the af
fairs of the association and to report to tha
members thereon. ' /
The ballots which have been sent out
for the: annual election, which occurs on
Junei 4. contain the names of the old
board of directors, and this latter 1 body
was averse to any member losing his posi
tion. The growers' committee has issued
the following circular, which. explains Us
side of the controversy, and 'which con
tains the recommendations -the directors
refuse to send to the, members:
CIRCTJLAB TO MEMBERS.
And your committee believe that the abovÂ«
objects, so much desired,- may -be accomplished
by these amendments and changes In methods.
And we do most earnestly urge every, member,
whether intending to withdraw , or -not, to at
least vote for these amendments, which In the
opinion of your committee make It possible,
under proper management, .for this association
to do all the business it .was formed to do, in
a practical business manner, retaining its
packing plant, its brands, its selling connec
tions and. the benefit of its advertising and the
strong moral influence on the market and price
that the union of so many â¢ growers has and
produces, on a co-operative basis, with small
and limited Individual liability for* those who
remain with it, while freely allowing those to
withdraw who wish to withdraw.
-.Fifthâ That the delivery of .his : iru!t to the
association be left optional with each member,
who should, however, give due 'notice to- the
association of his intention in advance of; crop
harvest.
' Fourth â That the directors be allowed to
borrow money on ; the security . of the fruit,
after it is actually "placed in- their hands, to
make advances to the contributors â a much
needed change.
Third â That any member be allowed to vol
untarily withdraw from the. association at any
time on an, equitable basis, thus removing one
source- of antagonism, by allowing any to with
draw who may wish to do so.
Secondâ That the president and vice presi
dent be elected by -and , from the number of
directors, so as to be in fact the executives
of the business policy. of the board.- ..-.
First â That the number of directors be re
duced from eleven to seven, and all salaries
(while yet limited) be placed in the control of
the directors, so that all salaries may be- im
mediately reduced by them when . need re
quires or the size of the business may demand.
Second â We. however, do believe it can bÂ«
continued as a practical working business ma
chine, and with the support of a large enough
number of members to make it of great bene
fit to the prune growers by such changes in the
by-laws and business methods as would make it
possible to accomplish the following results:
First â We do not believe the association can
be continued In any successful manner under
present by-laws and business purposes and
methods. ' , â¢',
Both the growers' committee and the
directors agreed on the" following â¢recom
mendations: . â¢ ',
CHANGES AGREED UPON.
At the nominating convention on May>2,
President Woods ruled discussion of asso
ciation affairs' out of order, and the meet
ing, which/was attended by a large num
ber of growers, at once resolved itselt
into a conference, to see what steps' could
be taken to perpetuate the association by
making a number of changes. A.commit
tee consisting^ of the following was ap
pointed for the purpose: Charles D.'Bla
ney (chairman), F. H. Babb, J. O. Hayes,
E. T. Pettit, S. H. Shelley, W. H. Law
rence, F. W. Crandall, J. T. Dunn, G. I*
Tarleton, Daniel, Snlvely and B. Quesne.
Several conferences were . hejd with the
directors of the association, and the latter
promised to send out any report the grow
ers' committee may have adopted. This
they afterward failed to do. The commit
tee charges that the directors have not
only refused to send out its side of the
question to the growers, who number
about 3700, but at once began to send out
that portion of the changes in the by
laws which all agreed . to, omitting-' the
recommendations of the committee. .As
the directors are the only ones having a
list of the members of the association,
this left the commi tee -without means of
making its 1 report public.
Furthermore, Chairman Blaney says
that the directors agreed not t& give the
results of the conferences to the press
until both sides could be presented at the
same time, but that late -last night the
directors gave their report to the local
press. . . ; Â» .
SAN JOSE, May 24.â The growers' com
mittee of eleven, appointed by the Cali
fornia Cured'Fruit Association to suggest
a pian of reorganization, and -the direc
tors of the association have locked horns
over a" report of . the ! proposed changes.
Charges have been made against the di
rectors of suppressing, part of the report
v to> further their own interests and to keep
the present board in office. This is all
because the growers believe ln'reducing
the' number of directors from eleven to
seven.

THANKS ALL AMERICANS.
This friendship you have proven to Â¦ us.
The French Antilles have Just suffered the
shock of a traffic ,e vent, of a catastrophe the
like of which the 'world had not. witnessed for
twenty centuries. The President of the United
States, Congress and the American people have
vied/ with one another In 'promptness to send
relief to our stricken countrymen. Permit me

and the entire population of these ; United

elon which Is headed by the most eminent of
our general officers. General Brugere.
Rochambeau was a strict' disciplinarian, a
severe and courageous commander. Careful of
the lives of his men, he was wont at times to
remark to the young men around him that dur
ing the long course of his military career 15,000
men had died under him, but that he could
not reproach himself with the death of a single
one of these. Thus, he earned for our army
the esteem of your people and won for himself
the affectionate devotion of your great Wash
ington. -
Hence It Is that this monument, which In -
'appearance seems only destined to evoke the
recollection of warlike deeds, becomes by the j
character of the struggle which It recalls and
of the man whom it glorifies a monument and
pledge of union between two nations. â¢ To-day,
last as they did 120 years ago, the soldleri and
sailors of France and of the United States
stand side by side; they surround this monu

As the President closed his remarks the
Countess de Rochambeau drew aside the
veils enveloping the figure, bringing into
view the massive bronze proportions of
the famous French commander, standlnr
proudly erect, with arm outstretched, di
recting the fortunes of war on the field of
Yorktown. A great cheer went up from
Frenchmen and Americans alike, and at
the eame instant the marine band broke

<Jied away Embassador Cambon escorted
to the front of the platform the youthful
sculptor. M. Harnar, who executed the
etatue. Then the Embassador. speaklne
In French, delivered a brief address. He
said in part:
STATUE IS TJNVEH^D.
I am sure, my fellow citizens, that you wel
come the chance which brings It about that
this embassy of the French people should
come to our shores at the very time when
Â¦we, In our turn, have done our part In start
ing' on the iÂ»ath of Independence a sister re
public â the republic of Cuba. (Applause.)
Mr. Embassador. the American people, pe
culiarly because they Are the American pscple
ana because the history of the United States
has bÂ«en bo interwoven with what France has
done for us; also because they are part of the
whole world which acknowledges and must
e\ f er acknowlege In a peculiar degree the
friendship of France, among so many lines In
the march of progress and civilization â the
American people, through- me, extend their
thanks to you and In their name I beg to ex
press my acknowledgments to the embassy
that has come here and to President Loubet
and all of the French nation, both for the
Â£? v u, f ? r the magnanimous spirit of friend
ship behind the deed, and I thank you. (Loud
Applause.)
Mr. ETT.ba-SEador, and you, the representa
tives of the mlgrhty republic of France â I ex
tend to you on behalf of the people of the
united States the warmest and most cordial
greeting;. We appreciate to the full all that

men as those who have been sent over here
by President Loubet to commemorate th-i un
veiling of thÂ« statue of the great marshal,
â¢wbo, with the eoldlers and sailors of Frar.ce.
etruck the decisive blow in the war which
etarted this country on the path of Inde
pendence amons the nations of the earth.
(Applause.) I am sure that I rive utterance
to the sentiments of the United States, of
every American to whom the honor and the
rlory of our republic in the past, as in the
present, are dear, when I say that we prize
this fresh proof of the friendship of the
French people, not only because It Is neces
sarily pleasing- to us to have the friendship
of a nation so mighty In war and so mighty
In peace as France has ever shown herself to
be. but because it is peculiarly pleasant to
feel. that, after a century and a quarter of
Independent existence as a nation, the French
republic should feel that in that century and
a. quarter we have Justified the sacrifices
France made on our behalf. (Applause.)
At its conclusion President RooBevelt
stepped to the front of the platform and
extended a generous welcome to the
French guests. The President spoke as
follows:
As the President concluded his address
the Countess de Rochambeau caught up
the cords of the flags enveloping the
statue and the massive bronze rigure
emerged from the folds of red. white and
blue. At the same instant the boom of
an artillery salute came from a battery
of heavy guns near by, and the strains of
the trench national hymn came from the
marine band. It . is an inspiring mo
ment, and, led by President Roosevelt,
the vast assemblage joined in cheering.
Another demonstration occurred at the
ciose of General Brugere's address, when
with characteristic French vehemence he
gave this pledge, of undying Franco-
American friendship: "Entre vous, entre
Jious; a la vie. a la mort" (Between you
between us; in life, in death).
Cardinal Gibbons was to have opened
the exercises with an invocation, but in
his unavoidable absence the Rev. r>r
Stafford delivered an impressive opening
prayer.

WASHINGTON, May 24.-Amid the en
thusiastic demonstration of a great con
course of people the superb bronze statue
of General Count de Rochaxnbeau, who
brought the forces of France across the
sea at the hour of greatest peril in the
American Revolution, was unveiled to
day. Seldom has an event presented so
many brilliant features of military,
pageantry and at the same time gave oc
casion for the manifestation of the strong
bonds of friendship existing between the
French republic and the United States.
For the first time in its history the na
tional capital witnessed the sight of rank
upon rank of French seamen swinging
through Pennsylvania avenue ami
mingling their cheers with those of the
American bluejackets and soldiers, while
at the same time the French tricolors
were entwined with the stars and stripes
aud the sound of the "Marseillaise" was
heard along with "The Star-spangled
isaiiner."

stated that as the pest appears at such long intervals the native birds do not seem to be aware
that he is good eating, but the English sparrow has got on to him and is devouring him ,at a
great rate. This js one case where the sparrow makes friends, and before the locust season â is

woman of New York City, is esconsed
for the summer in a cottage on the hotel
grounds with her husband, a maid and
a number of pets which she has brought
with her. You can practically tell a Goth
amite by the way she wears her clothes.
Mrs. Hyers is particularly striking in a
batiste linen color, made -over green taf
feta. Skirt and bodice alike have ver
tical insertions of batiste lace, which is
effective over the green. A chou at one

should be classified as a wild rose sort
of beauty. Bhe has hair like the 6un

Ing to artists and everybody else, in fact.
She has such good color, too, that she
looks as fresh as a rose every time you

The Drews have come and gone, taking
with them the Â«best wishes of many
friends they left behind. John Drew was
hospitably entertained at Burlingame and
by Mrs. Martin, and had many more in
vitations he was too busy to accept. His
daughter, Miss Louise Drew, who has re
cently Joined the. company, met a lot of
dear girls at Elsie Tallant's luncheon at
the University Club on Friday. The girls
expressed different opinions on the way
home. Some were completely carried
away with the young actress and pro
nounced her perfectly dear. Others mar
veled at her Eummer gown and hat, lay
ing particular 6tress upon what it meant
from a commercial point of view. Others
lamented her lack of beauty, but assured
each other that her father's reputation
would be her saving grace. Everybody
agreed, however, that she arranged her
hair beautifully. She wore it in a fluffy
pompadour effect about the face, and in
the back It was done lowâ very low. The
low coiffure exactly suited Miss Drew's

AMONG a number of distinguished
guests at Mrs. Merrill's tea on
Friday vas Mrs. Herman J.
Hall of Chicago, who always
tries tÂ» avoid attention, but
cannot help attracting admiration. She is
most enthusiastic in the cause she repre
sents, and her attractive personality
draws friends to the work she cham
pions. Mrs. Hall has been a patroness of
art for many years, but the outdoor sort
occupies most of her attention latterly.
Bhe brings very practical -ideas to 'is
along those lines, and expresses surprise
that nature does not get up and run away
because people get up floral combina
tions that make their grounds look like
crazy quilts instead of arranging the
grounds in such taste that a house will
not look as if it were carried along and
dropped somewhere by accident. The
walks, flower platB and trees should con
form in color tnd shape with the "lay"
of the grounds and the house as well, she
says. Mrs. Hall insists that California
has wonderful possibilities, as we have
euch abundant working material, and be
fore going back East she will organize a
woman's auxiliary of the American Park
and Outdoor Art Association in this city.
Mrs. Hall is president of such an aux
iliary in Chicago, and very practical work
is being accomplished. The ladies of the
California Club have offered their rooms,
in which a mass meeting will be held on
Wednesday afternoon of this week at
3:30 o'clock, at which the Park Commis-
Eioneri!, the Major, public school teachers
and many others are expected. All are
<nvited. I believe Ossian C. Simonds, who
for twenty years has been laying out
parks and streets, will make the plans
for San Francisco without expense here,
as the main association in the East will
assist the branch. It will be remembered
that Mrs. Hall was one of the judges for

WITH stately ceremonies befitting the occasion, the statue of the Comte de RochanA
beau has been unveiled at Washington and dedicated as a memorial of the aid given
by France to the American colonies during the struggle for independence. By a
happy coincidence this monument, which reminds us of the time when we were weak
and needed foreign help, is dedicated almost simultaneously with the inauguration at Havana of a
free government, called into being by our arms and inspired by our example. The torch of lib
erty which France helped us to keep aflame during the darkness of the War of the Revolution
has no| burned for ourselvesf alone. France herself has been guided. by it in many a dark period
of her history, and now Cuba looks to it as-the beacon that has brought her after years cf des
potism and oppression to the full freedom of an independent, self-governing nation.' â¢
The man whose statue has been chosen to stand as a symbol of the great historic friend
ship between France and the United States is not unworthy of the honor. He has not filled the
place in song and story and in popular imagination and affection that Lafayette holds, but none
the less his services both to France and to the United States were of the highest order. If he
was not so picturesque a figure as the rich young Marquis who at the age of 19 left his wealth and
the attractions of the most splendid capital in Europe to hasten to" America* and 'offer his sword
to Washington, he was a much more useful ally in trie struggle. He brought with him a formid
able force, and was moreover a general of large experience, well fitted to command and to direct
his force so as to render it most helpful in the war.
It is to be remembered that Rochambeau on one occasion showed a devotion to the
American cause that proved to be of *he highest value at a most critical time. When Washing
ton was on the point of moving southward for the purpose of intercepting Cornwallis, the army
had been without pay for a long time and the colonial treasury was bare of money! In that emer
gency the Count advanced $20,000 invgold out of his private fortune, and means were thus pro
vided for the march which did not end until Cornwallis was shut up in Yorktown and forced to
surrender.
The chief credit of the support given by France during the Revolution belongs, however,
not to one man nor set of men. It is not to Rochambeau, Lafayette, the King nor his coun
selors that America owes the debt of gratitude for help in her hour of need. That credit is due
to the French people. It was the popular enthusiasm for the American cause that carried the
court along with it and may be said to have forced the Ministers to ally themselves with the
colonies and become a partner in their struggle for independence. The Rochambeau monument,
therefore, will be a memorial of the union of two .great peoples in the cause of liberty, and it is
gratifying to know that at last the French have secured a liberty for themselves, founded like our
own on universal suffrage and guarded by a republican form of, government.

CHICAGO PATRONESS OF ART
WHO IS VISITING IN SAN
FRAXCISCO. |
ONE of the distinctly notable
events of the present theatrical
season is the engagement of
Kathryn Kidder, who will ap
pear in "The ' Country Girl"
at the Columbia to-morrow evening.
Miss Kidder has occupied a high
place in the hearts of local theater
goers since her unquestioned success
in "Madame Sans Gene," several seasons
ago, when she captivated the city by her
inimitable impersonation of the humorous
French laundry woman. No actress who
has visited this city has met with more
popular favor than Miss Kidder and this
fact should insure 'an audience of large
proportions when she comes here on Mon
day evening as the frolicsome Peggy in
David Garrick's immortal English com
edy. "The Country Girl" is one of the
oldest plays in existence, haying first
been produced over two centuries ago.
It is acknowledged by authorities to be
one of the classics of the stage and en
titled to rank with such comedies as "She
Stoops to Conquer," "A School for Scan
dal," "London Assurance" and "The
Rivals," etc. So far as humor and mirth
provoking situations are concerned, "The
Country Girl" is certainly at the head
of her class. Whenever it has been re
vived It has met with much favor and
the announcement that so distinguished
an actress as Miss Kidder will produce
the play this season has been received
with general approval. The actress has
never before essayed the role of Peggy,
though her friends have always consid
ered she was eminently suited for the re
quirements of the character.
The characters in "The Country Girl,
to be satisfactorily played, require the
set vices of actors of recognized merit, and
a glance at the company associated with
Miss Kidder proves that they are of the
necessary standard. Prominent on the
list is Norman Hackett, who for several
years has been connected with leading
Shakespearean productions. Another
well-established favorite Is Robert V.
Ferguson, who has several times been
seen in San Francisco, and always to ex
cellent advantage. Mr. Ferguson has a
high place among the legitimate comedi
ans of the present day. Other players
who will be associated with Miss Kidder
are: T. C. Hamilton, Seymour Stratton,
Munroe Salisbury, H. I* Davidson, T. C.
O'Erien, Marion Ashworth, Olga Fllnck
and Ellen Armond.
Peter F. Daily opens at the Orpheum
this afternoon. That- he will be accorded
a warm reception is beyond question. No
comedian ever gained more popularity
with local audiences than versatile Peter.
He has not been here In many a year.
When Jast here he was a member of May
Irwln's company. He made good then
and is sure to renew his previous success.
Daily will present a comedy and will be
assisted by clever people. He will ba a
whole show In himself, for as a funmaker
he stands supreme. The Orpheum has a
number of good acts in addition to some
holdovers who scored heavily last week.
"The Singing Girl" continues on her
merry career for one week more at
the Tivoli Opera-housei She has been
greeted nightly by delighted audiences.
Her confreres have also i assisted in a
marked degree to furnish a delightful en
tertainment, and their efforts in this di
rection have been amply, rewarded by
public approval. The Herbert music has
been much admired, particularly the fine
ensemble numbers, and the' principals.
chorus and orchestra have done them full
justice. The topical numbers go for
numerous encores, interpreted by fun
makers Hartman, Webb and Cashman,
and much good singing is done by Frances
Graham, Arthur Cunningham and Harold
Gordon. Annie Myers is delightful as the
singing girl. "The Toy Maker" comes
next with a. finer' cast than, ever, new
songs and new verses.
"Fiddle Dee Dee" continues at Fisch
er's. The burlesque has broken all rec
ords in this city and bids fair to estab
lish a precedent that other plays will
have bard work to equal. Kolb and Dill
are irresistibly funny as German come
dians. Their dialect Is good and their
"business" is funny. Barney Bernard im
personates a Hebrew without giving -of
fense. He causes laughter whenever he Is
on the stage. His walk and mannerisms,
coupled with. his bland smile and dialect,
make him one of the best men In his line
that local theatergoers have ever seen.
The balance of the cast Is very good.
"Hands Across the Sea" is the next of
fering at the Central Theater. Miss Fan
ny Mclntyre. the new leading lady, has
scored a brilliant success.' She gave evi
dence In "Woman Against Woman" that
she - possesses talent and versatility.

THE MODOG VElSrDETTA.
fHE acquittal of the Modoc lynchers, who in a cowardly way murdered five human
beings, one of the victims being a helpless old man and the other a young boy, has been
followed by a vendetta against" the witnesses who refused to perjure themselves to shield
the guilty slayers : - ,
These witnesses have been compelled to flee the county and some of theni do not feel safe
far from the..scene of the crime, but keep in hiding wherever they are for fear that the venge
ance of the murderers m'av find them. â¢ '
Some of these fugitives were of the party /of murderers when the crime was committed.
They saw the killing of the gray, old mail and the young boy's gallant but ineffectual struggle for
his life. They saw law and justice perverted by the connivance of officers charged with the duty
of protecting life, and the) witnessed/the participation by such officers in five murders committed
un^er the most cowardly and cruel circumstances. Some of these witnesses did not find their
consciences quickened until long after â¢ that night of horrors. Then they told the truth to escape
the further pursuit of remorse. But. they made a mistake. They thought the jury would appre
ciate their desire to purge their minds and memory of that night of crime and cowardice. They
now know why the jury was unsympathetic. It. was because every member of it knew that a ver
dict of guilty meant death or exile for him; They, feared the vendetta, and no Sicilian or Cor
sican ever knew better than they the price which each must pay if he kept his oath. Had that
jury found a verdict of guilty it is probable that not a single member of it would be living in
Modoc County now. Those who would not go into exile would be in their graves. '.
What can California do about it? Nothing at all. ! That county has deliberately written
itself down as a place where murder is no crime and the law cannot be enforced. Men who per
jure themselves to protect murderers are honored as' representative citizens; while those who tell
the truth are compelled to flee for their' lives. Murder and perjury being at a premium and
truth at a discount in Modoc County, there will be a general regret that it was not left in the
hands of the Indians to be governed from their stronghold in the lava beds. Captain Jack, Scon
chin and Scar-Faced Charley would have been only living up to their lights if they did, midnight
murder, and their crimes would not have disgraced the decent white people, nor have given Cali
fornia an ill flavor abroad. . :
We have said the State can do nothing about it. That is not intended to mean that the
State cannot make some provision against like affairs in the future. The Legislature may pro
vide that the State shall have a change of venue in criminal cases where fear of murder prevents
or obstructs the administration of justice. We have not heretofore been inclined to favor such a
radical change in our criminal statutes. . The right to a change of venue now rests with # the party
accused of crime, when he cannot get a fair trial on account of prejudice against him in the com
munity in which his alleged offense was committed. Removal of the case is provided for in the
interest of innocence, or to give even guilt all its rights under the law.
Such a case as that of Modoc Count), does not often occur. It is .apparently a universal
sympathy with crime, with the highest crime known to moral and statute law. In the eye of the
law the people of that county are accessories to -the crime of murder, some of .them before and
the rest of them after the fact. There is no , reason to believe that murder or any other 'major
crime can ever be punished there. If punishment be attempted it must depend upon evidence,
and all who can testify have been in a common and general conspiracy v to conceal murder and
protect murderers from punishment. Is it likely that this unholy compact .will be broken? We
think not. If witnesses who testified to the truth were not being hunted out of the county like
wild beasts, we would be inclined to let punishment come upon Modoc in the form of a crim
inal notoriety which would cause it to be avoided by all law-abiding people. But we are not sure
that the future should not be provided for by giving the law a chance through permitting a
change of venue to the State. There will be more murders and infamous crimes in Modoc
County and more juries there to consult personal safety by foi swearing themselves. More wit
nesses will be compelled to sacrifice their property and save their lives by flight. The remedy
will be to bring some of Modoc's representative citizens and murderers down into some civilized
county and convict and hang them. . .

The Irish ' fair, with all its brilliant
throng of merry lads and lasses, : its
music and its graceful dancers, its srayly
decked castles and towers and Its bril
liant illumination, now exists only as a
pleasant memory. The great festival was
brought to a close last night. lAlthough
a great portion of the general public
would have been glad to have it continue
for at least one week longer, those who
have worked so faithfully at the booths,
in the Irish Cross Road Dancing School,
the museum and at the other attractions
were glad enough when the end arrived.
A month of continued festivity is almost
enough to satiate. any one's love for ex
citement. [
Although the free list was suspended
last night the Â¦ Pavilion was crowded to
its full capacity. The visitors consisted
chiefly of men. There was no regul Â¦ e
programme and the booths were given an
opportunity to auction off the remainder
of their stock. In front of every booth
an auctioneer was stationed and articles
of every description, from a lady's bonnet
down to a paper of pins, were put up for
sale.
Professor Allen's Iroquois band did not
confine itself to the main platform, but
visited the attractions in various parts of
the Pavilion, thus assisting in distribut
ing the crowd and in giving every one of
the visitors a chance to enjoy the music.
The band, under the competent direction
of Professor Allen, rendered commen.l
able service during the fair.' As on the
previous evening the concert was com
menced with the playing of Mayor
Schmitz's thrilling march, "The Yankee
Hustler," which has won great popularity
at the fair. Visitors frequently requested
the band to play it.
The fair was open' about twenty-five
days and nights and during this time it
is estimated that about 150,000 people vis
ited the fair, an average of 6000 each day
and night. On next Monday morning a
drawing will be held in the Pavilion for
prizes on which tickets were sold. All the
different committees will be in attendance
at this drawing. On the following day
Superintendent Tidball, to whom a large
portion of the credit for the success of
the fair Is due. will commence to re
move the decorations.

Provo the Most Skillful in the Cham-
pionship Doubles Tournament,
Defeating Berkeley.
-Polytechnic High School again carried
off the honors on the tennis courts yes
terday. Last week William Geary won
the singles tournament and yesterday he,
with Horace Mann, won the champion
ship doubles. In the latter the matches
were' much closer than In' the former and
in the final the Polytechnic men won by
a small margin. This match was by
far the best of either tournament. In it
Geary and Mann, of Polytechnic, were
opposed by N. Esterly and Clinch.
In the first A set the Berkeley boys out
played their opponents and won without
difficulty, the score being 6-2. Geary and
Mann were unable to handle the accurate
cut strokes of their opponents. In the
second and third sets the Polytechnic
men played a more aggressive game and
won easily. The fourth set after a long
struggle went to Esterly and Clinch. In
the fifth set the Berkeley boys were tired
and their opponents finished them off
handily. The complete score In favor
of Geary and Mann was 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-7,
6-L â¢ 'Â¦
In the first round Geary and Mann beat
Hinds and Smith of Oakland High School.
The score was 6-3, 6-3. At the same time
Alec Beyfuss and John Cassell, of Lowell
High School, disposed of C. Lewis and M.
Epstein, of Alameda High School. The
score was 6-2, 6-2. Esterly and Clinch of
Berkeley High School beat Henry Mills
and G. Ridley of Trinity. The score was
10-8, 6-2. In this round Lick High School
had a bye. . Â¦
The semi-finals brought out some clever
play. In both matches three sets were
required. In the first Harry Gorhara
and Leonard - Cutler, of Lick, were beaten
by Esterly and Clinch, of Berkeley High.
Tho score was 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Jn the other
match of this round Beyfuss and Cassell
were beaten by Geary and Mann. Tha
former after winning the second set look
ed to have a good chance of beating their
larger opponents, but the final set went
to Polytechnic without the Ios3 of a
game. The score was 6-3, 5-7, 6-0.
In the finals Geary and. Mann won
three sets out of five, which gives them
the championship for 1902. Geary will re
ceive two medals, one for winning the
doubles and one for the singles. Mann
will also, receive a medal. â¢

shal P. J. Murphy appeared before Jus
tice Genty to-day and swore out warrants
for the arrest of Mrs. Dorothy Williams,
H. E. Wilder and Michael J. Regan,
charging thein with mlsdemeators. Tho
trouble arose over the removal of the
body of Richard J. Williams from St.
Vincent's Cemetery on May 20 and Its
shipment to San Francisco. Williams was
buried in the cemetery last November.
P. J. Murphy was Williams' stepfather.
Mrs. Williams, the widow of the de
ceased, is charged with illegally having
caused the body to be disinterred; M. J.
Regan is accused of having illegally dis
interred the body of a dead person that
bad not been buried for a period of one
year, and H. E. Wilder Is charged with
having illegally moved and transported
through the streets of Vallejo the body
of a dead person and shipped it to a
crematory company -in San Francisco.
Mrs., Williams and Mr. Wilder will appear
before Justice Genty on Monday and en
ter their pleas.
Through some misunderstanding a dls-
Interment and removal permit was Issued
by the health department of this city, but
It Is now found that the department has
no jurisdiction as far as St. Vincent's
Cemetery is concerned, as it is outside tho
city limits. J

More than five hundred people attended
the entertainment given last night In Odd
Fellows' Hall by U. S. Grant Council of
the Junior. Order of American Mechanics
and Martha Washington Council of the
Daughters of Liberty. The decoration of
the hall was in the tricolors, surmounted
by the emblem of the Juniors in electric
lights, and added to by a profusion of
American flags. The programme present
ed included a fancy dance by Miss Hazel
Dugan; soprano solo, Miss Nichollson;
recitation. Miss Tryphina Prltchard; dia
lect stories, Rollin C. Ayers; violin solo,
Charles Robson; contralto solo. Miss Lo
gan Tooley. After the last number Fred
C Pattison, master of ceremonies, intro
duced Mayor E. E. Schmitz, who paid a
tribute to' the American flag that was so
liberally displayed, saying:
That banner which stands for the lofty prin
ciples of our advanced civilization, which rep
resents the defense ! of the right and the un
doing of the wrong, which typifies honor and
freedom and upholds the equal rights of all
men before the law, is an inspiration and an
inducement to the highest thought and the
noblest aspiration. â¢
After speaking of the principle of the
American people, which is equal protec
tion for all, he spoke of the public
schools. In part he said:
I have favored liberality and even generosity
in the treatment of our local public schools. I
have done this not only because of the senti
ments which I have already expressed to you,
but because the American public school is to
nje the truest republic on earth.
It is a leveler of classes, it is the promoter
of equal conditions, it is the greatest factor in
producing our American homogeneity. . It
takes the child of our foreign Immigrant and
transforms him almost with the wand of a ma
gician Into an embryo American citizen, and It
takes the children of our native born and de
velops them along the line of truest citizenship.
I favor the American public school system
because it promotes tolerance and equality of
social condition.
I favor the American public school system
because it gives' the wageworker the hope of
advancement for his childen; .it -gives him
something to look forward to and to live for. It
1a bis hope in life. It has made the American
laborer the most Intelligent and efficient wage
earner on earth. It opens to him every avenue
of aspiration and of ambition. It places him
on an equal footing with his wealthier neigh
bor. . It gives him a standing and a place in
the empire of intellect. It gives him an equal
chance in the world. It makes him a man.
The Mayor's address was frequently and
loudly applauded, and after he retired
there was a programme of fifteen dances
under the direction of the following:

Louis Ezle, a well-known naturalist of

eruptions of Mont Pelee more than 20,000

known to the world, have been killed!
Specimens of the mongoose were im
ported into Martinique two years ago, and
they and their progeny had driven the
snakes into the mountains, most of them
to Mont Pelee. The mongoose continues
to kill the snakes, and the island, he says
will now be in great part free from the
pest.

There- was a ' discussion â¢ of the next

Invitations came from Los Angeles,

committee on meeting places. Dr. Rob

The Rev. Dr. Amos Boyce conveyed to
the assembly the greetings of the Presby
terian church of Mexico, , where the work
was begun by the board of home missions
of the Presbyterian church, United States

ico might adopt the revised creed.
The Rev. George D. Matthews, In con

tion of the Alliance of Reformed Churches,
spoke about the persecutions, of Protest
ants in Russia. The Rev. Dr. William H.
Roberts conveyed the greetings of the
western section of the Alliance.. â¢:.">;.;-.
Senator Beveridge said in part:
"I have always felt that denominations
are a good thing. Denominations give to
men of different temperaments an oppor
tunity to work in spheres congenial to
themselves and to focus their efforts on
the same aim. As to its civic side, the
Church is a great conservator of public
morals. Destroy the churches and you
will destroy the Government. The flag
and the cross are alike in one respectr-'
they never retreat. You may temporarily
close a church here, a flag may be with
drawn there,. but only in order to advance
more permanently their interest. They
have one common purposeâ the cross .to
advance Christianity, the flag to make
this Christian country the greatest power
on earth."
Dr, Buckley, : the first speaker, was re
ceived with great applause. He reviewed
the history of the Presbyterians and the
Methodists, and laid great stress on the
doctrines they held In common.
"Times are out of joint," Dr. Buckley
said in closing. "Protestantism cannot
be maintained in our age except by great
organization; but I say to you that the
Presbyterian church and the Methodist
Episcopal church in the United States
hold within them great potentiality for
the extension of the doctrines of evan
gelical Christianity. Let us stand as
neighboring rocks against the growing
evil of agnosticism that is brought to us
under modern' names and under new
guises, and against the doctrines dissem
inated by the followers of the old man in
Rome, and, not the least, against the cor
rosive fluidâ the materialistic spirit of the
age."

mains be permanently interred here, but
the wishes of the family of the deceased
were otherwise, and it is the present In
tention to have them conveyed to Eng
land. It â¢will be determined before that
time whether or not a United States
warship will carry the remains to Eng
land. - . â¢ â¢;â ...-Â¦â¢
Mr. Raikes, the Secretary .and Charge
of the British embassy, called upon As
sistant Secretary Hill to advise with him
respecting the funeral crrangements and
finally these were entrusted to Hill in
their official features, A tentative ar
rangement has been made, which must
be approved by Lady Pauncefote before
being put into execution. In brief, this
provides that the remains of the late Em
bassador shall be taken from the embassy
at 31:45 next Wednesday to'. St. John's
Episcopal Church, where he worshiped.
The honorary pall-bearers will consist of
the five Embassadors in Washington, Dr.
von HoHeben, M. Cambon, Count Casslni,
Senor Aepiroz and Signor Desplanches,
Secretary Hay, Senator Frye, president
pro tem. of the Senate, and Speaker Hen
derson of the House of Representatives.
President Roosevelt drove to the Brit
ish embassy as soon as he had become
disengaged from the ceremonies attend
ing the Rochambeau exercises. He was
received in the drawing-room by the First
Secretary of the Embassy, Raikes, who
now becomes British Charge d' Affaires,
and by. some of the ladles of the house
hold. The President expressed . his deep
sense of bereavement at the death of the
Embassador, not only in -behalf of the
Government, but also for the people of
the country, to whom Lord Pauncefote
had become endeared in many ways. Sec
retary Hay and the other members of the
Cabinet also called at the embassy, leav
ing their cards and expressing their con
dolences. The foreign Embassadors and
Ministers also left their cards.
FRESIDENT AT EMBASSY.
Having dispatched his.mesage the Sec
retary of State proceeded to attend the
ceremonies connected with the dedication
of the Rochambeau statue. At first there
seemed to be an incongruity in this, but
it appeared that an act of Congress re
quired the statue to be unveiled on this
date, and although there was every dis
position in official circles and on the part
of the French embassy to defer the cer
emonies until another day in deference
to the memory of the deceased, yet they
felt bound to carry forward the pro
gramme. . .' ...
As soon as it became generally known
that Lord Pauncefote was dead flags
were half-masted over the different em
bassies and legations. At the Arlington
Hotel, where the visiting Frenchmen who
have come to witness the Rochambeau
statue unveiling are stopping, the French
flag was placed at half-mast.
Secretary Hay after a conference with
the President proceeded directly to the
British embassy, where he made a formal
call of condolence as the personal repre
sentative of the President. Then return
ing to the State Department Hay dis
patched the following cablegram:
"DEPARTMENT OF STATE. WASH
INGTON, May 24.â The Marquis of Lans
downe, London: Permit me to express
my deep sympathy and sorrow at the
death ot Lord Pauncefote. His Majesty's
Government has lost an able and faithful
servant and this country a valued friend.
"JOHN HAY."

Tf TT 17 ASHINGTON, May 24.â Lord
)\ / Pauncefote. the British Em
\L/VU bassador to the United
V V States, died at the embassy
this morning at 5:35 o'clock.
The improvement which had Deen noted
In his condition during the past week re
ceived a sudden check about 6 o'clock
last evening, when it was noticed that
j he was experiencing difficulty In breath
! ing. Dr. Jung, his physician, was imme
: dlately sent for, and he decided upon a
! consultation with a local physician, in
the meantime telegraphing for Dr. Osier
of Baltimore. In his stead came Dr.
Thayer of Johns Hopkins University, ar
riving about 2 o'clock this morning.
â¢ The patient's pulse was still good, and
when Vr. Thayer left the embassy at 3,
o'clock, for Baltimore the Embassador j
was resting so comfortably that a cable
gram was senfto his son-ln-iaw, Broa
ley, in London, that there was no im
mediate danger. ,
Soon after i o'clock a distinct weakness
of the heart developed and his pulse be
gan to collapse. He died so peacefully
that it surprised even his physician, who
feared that the asthmatic affection would
prove troublesome when the end came.
1 At the bedside when the distinguished
diplomat passed away were Lady Paunce
fote, the Hon. Maude Pauncefote, Miss
Sjbil and Miss Audrey Pouncefote, Dr.
Jung and Clerk Radford af the embassy.
Coming to "Washington when he did, on
the heels of the egregious "faux pas" of
Lord Sackville-West, Lord Paunce
fote so conducted himself and the busi
ness of his office as to gain the great re
spect of our own Government and the en
larged confidence of his own, especially
that . of the Premier, Lord Salis
bury. Many delicate pieces of diplo
matic negotiation with this Gov
ernment were handled by him,
notably the Bering Sea Commission, the
Alaskan-Canadian boundary convention,
the Anglo-Venezuelan boundary arbitra
tion and the recent Nicaragua canal
treaty. Of his finesse and ability In these
instances, and, in fact, in most others, his
own Government most certainly could
find little fault. , .
Lord Pauncefote was lately accused
In 1892, In recognition of his eminent ser
vices, ho was given the Grand Cross of
the Bath, and in 1393 was raised to the
rank of Embassador Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary to the United
States. On November 21, 1894, during a
visit home he was sworn as a member of
the Privy Council.
In 1899 he was one of the delegates from
Groat Britain to the Peace Conference
held at The' Hague. In August of this
year Sir Julian was elevated to the peer
age.
In 1888 on the recall, by request of the
United States Government, of Lord Sack
villc-"West, .Sir Julian Pauncefote succeed
ed him as the British Minister at Wash
ington, which position he continued to nTl
until his death with an ability second to
none of his predecessors since Lord
Lybn's tenure during the days of our
Civil War. .
In 1880 he was created Companion of the
Bath, also K. C. M. G., and in 1882 suc
ceeded Lord Tenterden as Under-Secre
tary of State for Foreign Affairs. In 1885
he received the Grand Cross of the Order
of St Michael and St. George (G. C. M.
G.). '
In 1873 he was appointed Chief Justice of
the Leeward Islands, and in 1874 Legal As
sistant Under-Secretary of State for the
Colonies. In 1876 he was made Assistant
(Legal) Under-Secretary of State for For
eign Affairs.
bar at Inner Temple in 1852 and then
joined the Oxford circuit. In May, 1865, he
was appointed Attorney General of Hong
kong and in 1869. and again in 1872, acted
as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
He received the thanks of the executive
and legislative councils of Hongkong for
his services to the colony and was knight
ed in recognition thereof in 1874 by letters

Abbey 25 guineas are asked for seats.
Ovei" 500 coronation bonfires already have
been arranged for In the provinces.
A curious precedent in celebrating King
Edward's crowning has been set by the
corporation of the city of London, which
has decided to make a personal gift of
Â£5000 to the King to use as he sees fit in
token of the continuance of the corpora
tion's ancient loyalty to the sovereign.
This Is exclusive of the appropriation for
decoration and entertainment or for the
King's hospital fund.
Among the guests not having admit
tance by right of rank, but who were spe
cially invited by the King to attend the
services, is Mrs. Arthur Paget. daughter
vt the late Mrs. Paran Stevens of New
York and wife of Major General Paget of
the Scots Guards, ilrs. Paget will preside
over a huge coronation ball July 2, in aid
of the King's hospital fund, it will be
held at the Crystal Palace, where 12.00'.
sauare feet will VÂ»e laid out in parquet
flooring, the largest area, it is said, ever ,
laid down ior dancing. All the members
of the royal family are expected to be
present.
The royal celebration night at the Grand
Opera, Covent Garden, June 30. is expect
ed to break all box office records. The
stall will cost 20 guineas, which means
10,000 guineas for royal visitors. Cabinet
Ministers and other high personages.
Hundreds of seats already have been al
lotted. Such boxes as are not taken by
the court will cost from 60 guineas- to 100
guineas. Many of these already are sold.
It Is estimated that Covent Garden will
hold that night Â£1S,000. Jean de Reszke
and Madames Melba, Calve, Nordica and
other stars will take part in the pro
gramme, which will include scenes from
"Lohengrin," "Siegfried." "Tannhauser"
and "Lucia di Lammermoor."
Among the ante-coronation festivities
the Ascot meeting bids fair to be the
most popular, though this year the King
will have a stand to himself. The rush
of applications for admittance to the
royal inclosure, where King Edward for
merly watched the races, is unprecedent
ed. The Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of
Clarendon, with only 1500 tickets at his
disposal, has -been obliged to disappoint
hundreds, among whom are many distin
guished persons who have previously
benn accustomed to mix in this exclusive
gathering. The price of tickets also has
â¢been raised to 4 guineas.
"Almost a fairy city," is the way one
writer forecasts London's appearnce dur
ing coronation week. Arches and fes
toons, planned by municipal and artistic
committees, will be erected in every quar
ter of the metropolis. The preparations
for these, however, are anything but
fairylike. Each week sees London more
hideous, with countless half-finished
stands, many of them shutting out the
light from houses and all reeking with
the smell peculiar to rain-soaked pine. In
the maze of stands going up around the
. houses of Parliament and Westminster
Practically all the invitations to the
coronation service ; have been . sent . out.
The dowacer Peeresses will-sit with the
reigning peeresses and fwear similar
robes and coronets. In this way. It Is
pointed out, many celebrated women who
have been separated by bitter family
feuds will be brought together for the
first time in many years. The eldest sons
and daughters of peers will occupy sep
arate seats, which rather complicates
matters from a family view. .
The presents which King Edward will
give to foreign envoys are -now ready.
Whitelaw Reid, the American Special
Embassador, and his associates will re
ceive Dins and brooches of gold, mostly
in the form of the initial "E" set with
1-;ubies and pearls with a gold enameled
i .-own above. In a few cases, perhaps,
'.ostlier presents will be made to the
. heads of special embassies.

LONDON, May 24.â A wealthy woman
named Sllva recently died at Lisbon and
left her entire property to a rooster. She
was a fervid spiritualist, a believer in the
transmigration of souls and imagined that
the soul of her dead husband had entered
the rooster. She caused a special fowl
house to be built and ordered her .servants
to pay extra attention to their "master's
wants. . ..; ...
The disgust of her relatives over the will
caused the story to become public, and
a lawsuit might have followed had not
one of the heirs adopted the simple ex
pedient of having the wealthy rooster
killed, thus becoming himself the neat of
kin.

"I sincerely believe that practically all
of our nervous troubles are caused by
Imperfect nourishment. It was fortunate
for me that I could get such a food as
Grape-Nuts.. You" can use this letter, but
don't publish my name, please.'"- Name
tfven by Postum Co.. BatUe Creek/Mich.
"He explained to me that Grape-Nuts
contains a goodly portion of phosphate of
potash, a nerve and brain food, and that
the food being partially digested the
sj stem could make use of it easily. At
any rate I got well and both the doctor
and myself know that Grape-Nuts made
it possible.
"He put me on a certain line of. treat-
ment and Insisted that I use three or
four teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts each
meal. I was under his care for several
months. I steadily improved until now
I am fully restored to both mental and
bodily vigor.
.. "Jt was the same old s'tory. I was dosed
with medicine and massaged and bathed.
Finally I left there and went to another
specialist, who told me I would only live
a few months. This rather frightened
me and I placed myself under Dr. .
He said the stomach was at fault and
probably I had not been giVen the right
kind of food.
A gentleman in Baltimore Bays: "About
two years ago I began to experience a
peculiar depression, occasionally with
pains in the back part of my head and
down along the spine. Gradually my
eyesight began to fail and " my memory
grew poor. A general nervousness set in.
I used all the will power I could com-
mand to help myself, but was forced to
give up a good position and seek the ad-
vice of the family doctor. He said neur-
asthenia and sent me to a Â£reat nerve
specialist. So for four mmiths I was
massaged and dosed with medicine, but
all to no benefit; then I went . to New
York and consulted Dr. . He sent me
to another great specialist, and he in turn
sent me to Sanitarium, where I stay-
ed for a long time.
"What a hades some people go through
because their food does not supply the
right kind of nourishment to the body.
Take the following for example.

The British ship Leicester Caetle, Captain
Peattie, arrived yesterday forty-four days from

ceived yesterday for her to proceed north,- but
she was in and anchored before they could be
given to the pilots. John Curttn, a boarding
house runner, fell overboard from the launch
Jennie C while alongside the Leicester Castle
and had a narrow escape from a dreadful
death. The tide carried him between two
smaller launches which were banging together
in tb/s swell. Curtln avoided a crushing by
diving, and when he came to the surface some
one grabbed and pulled him out of harm's
way. Curtin made up for his uncomfortable
experience by taking off two of the Castle's
crew. .

Mxs. John Silo-rich Dies.
These 200 pieces were parts of mortar
battery car* and weighed all the way
from a few pounds to fourteen tons.
They were shipped from the East and
represented a large outlay of good Gov
ernment money. Not only were they
valuable, but they were very necessary
to the completion of the fortlcation work
In the^neighborhood of Point Bonita. To
have duplicated them .would . have in
volved a long delay as well as a heavy
expenditure. Olsen did his work quickly
and thoroughly. The last piece, weighing
seven tons, was pulled to the surface yes
terday, and within a few weeks the re
covered hardware will have been installed
according to original intentions. v
April 6 'went to the bottom off
Point Bonita, In a storm. The scow con
taining the equipment, was completely

pieces that made up the cargo have been
recovered.

O. Collier, a machinist, 65 years of age, and
living- on Jessie street, near Third, jumped from
the ferry steamer Bay City yesterday morning
with Bulcldal Intent. Captain Bradley stopped
the vessel, lowered a boat and frustrated Col
lier** intention by picking him up. He was
pumped dear of salt water at the Harbor Hos
pital and placed between hot blankets, where
he remained until the effects of the chock had
passed. Collier had filled his pockets with
pieces of iron pipe, but the density of the
water and the promptness of Captain Bradley
rendered the sinkers of no avail Collier was
formerly in good circumstances. Adversity and
ill-health, he eays, were responsible for his
desire for death.

Obviously one cannot reply to mere vitupera

a clear statement of the cause of my dismissal.
I have Bfmply to say that the tone and sub
stance cf your letter do not In the least cor
respond with our previous 'conversations, with
various letters. to me of which you doubtless
have copies I and which I therefore need not
quote, or with statements reported to me by
polleagues and others as having: been quite re
cently made by you to them. It is true that
you once made criticisms of the work of- my
department in which you would not be sup
ported by any Latinist in America,' and which
you subsequently withdrew with the explana-
STYLES IT VITUPERATION.
"It is now optional with you either to ten
der your resignation to take effect at the end
of the current academic year, or â¢ to accept
this letter as a final dismissal from the uni
versity to take effect on July 31. 1002. Very
truly yours. Â¦ .
"DAVID S. JORDAN. President."
"I have been thus explicit with great re
luctance, because I had hoped that the matter
might be adjusted by your withdrawal with
out the necessity for the use of this unpleas
antly plain language.
"While I have not been favorably Impressed
with your Ideals of departmental success, I
should probably not have brought this matter
to a final l?sue on this ground alone.
"No better illustration of the ground of these
objections can be eiven than is shown by your
recent attempts to appeal from the appointing
power, with which reets also the power of
removal, to others whose relation. If any, is
advisory only, and who are in no position to be
judicially cognisant of the facts in a case
of this kind.
"I have stated that in . my judgment the
Interests of the university demand a reorgani
zation of the department of Latin. The strong
est reaeon for this belief is that your person
ality Is such that I, as executive officer of the
university, cannot get along with you. I havo
found an Intense selfishness controlling all
your relation* and I ha\-Â« been constantly
aware of efforts to accomplish results by in
direction and lntrlgrue. Your department has
been repeatedly torn by dissensions for which
you have been largely to blame. I cannot re-'

respect his character; nor will I be responsible

that course I have regarded it as a dutv due to '
my piof.ssion to obtain. If it could be'done, a
plain statement of the reasons for my dis
r-iisFal. This is the moral rijrht of a professor
who haÂ« boers the head of an important depart

your a-n statement in a circular letter to

*5ue to lark of scholarship, of ability as a
tracher made manifest by a "trial of eleven
years, it is desirable for the university at this
particular juncture, however unfortunate for
me. that that fact should plainly appear. If,
on the contrary, as I know that some believe,
my removal is due to your determination to
roo^ out of the faculty every man "who did
not," as you expressed it to one of my col
leaeues in referring to me. "stand by us in
our troubles of last year." then that fact,
too. should be made plain in order that others
who may be apked to come here may know to
Â¦what hind of a place they are invited.
In this matter I dli not act wholly on my
own Judgment., but upon that of many whose
advic* I asked, and whose opinion, in sub
.ptance. Is expressed in the following extract
from a letter addressed to me by a distin
guished Latinift in one of the greatest Ameri
can universities:
"It certainly I? not in the interests of the
university that thÂ» president should be. per
mittÂ«l_Jx> thus indulge his personal prejudice.
In your C5>s<Â» I should not resign, but shoul-i
court inquiry and a fair hearing, and I be-
UÂ«VÂ« in this matter 1 voico the sentiment of
your fellow-teachers throughout the country.
The credit of Inland Stanford hs* already suf
fered severely throughout the country by the
arbitrary action of Its president."
With this object in view. It is true that,
as you Intimate in your letter to which thin
is a reply. I have sought through some of the
trustees, and by all other m^ans in my power,
to bring the matter to such a clearly stated

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 29, 1902.
Professor E. M. Pease. Stanford University â
Dear Sir: For reasons which must be manifest
to you from our previous Interviews and cor
respondence on the subject la the past four
years. It seems to me necessary that I should
row effect a reorganization of the department
of Latin. I therefore ask your resignation of
the chair of Latin, to take effect at the end
of the present academic .year. Very truly
yours, DAVID t?. JORDAN, President.
STANFORD UNIVERSITT, April 23, 1302.
PresMent David S. Jordan. Mariford Univer
s-ity, Cal. â Dear Sir: I wish to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of March 29 asking
for my resignation of the chair of Latin.
After a service of more than ten years it
seems to me but fair, and m accordance with
professional courtesy, that I should be given
the reasons' which have led you to make this
request. I therefore would respectfully ask
for a definite statement of. these reasons. Very
truly yours. Â¦ . E. Mi PEASE.
Office, of the President.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 22. 1002.
Professor B. M. Pease, Stanford University-
Dear Sir: In response to your note of April 23,
permit mÂ« to say:
All phases of the matter, in question have
been discussed between us in the past four
years. I must therefore decline to give further
formal roasons for my action, other than to
repeat that I . am convinced that the interests
of the university Tviil be served by a reorgani
zation of the department of Latin. Very truly
jours. DAVID S. JORDAN. President.
FIBST EXCHANGE OF NOTES.
to resign his chair or consider
himself dismissed from the univer
sity. Professor Pease has held the chair
In Latin since the founding of the \xn\^
versity, but for the past four years his
relations with the president have been
anything but friendly and his dismissal
was not unexpected. He is much es
teemed by his students, who deeply regret
that euch a. course as that adopted by
President Jordan has become necessary.
Professor Pease is a graduate of the
University of Colorado, where he took his
master's degree in 1885. Before accepting
his present position at Stanford he was
an instructor in Latin at Smith College
and professor of Latin at Bowdoin Col
lege, and he ranks as one of the leading
classical scholars of the country. He was
ajv ardent sympathizer with Professors
Ross and Howard when their dismissal
j was found necessary last year. The re
lations between Professor Pease and some
of the other members of the Latin de
partment have been strained, and thi3
seems to have influenced President Jor
dan in a measure to take his present ac
tion.
The correspondence that has passed be
tween President' -Jordan - and Â¦ Professor
Pease in regard to the dismissal is here
given:

As to the views of Eastern professors. It can
only be said that these gentlemen have de
rived their Information through Professor
Pease. DAVID STARR JORDAN. President.
This statement, with the reasons given
in his letters to Professor Peaae, shows
clearly the stand taken by President Jor
dan.
The removal of Professor Pease was under
consideration in 1806.- or earlier, and his resig
nation was first asked for on December 18,
1S97,. long before the culmination of the Rose
episode.
President Jordan when Interviewed In
regard to Professor Pease's dismissal and
the reasons for it gave out the following
signed statement: â¢ â¢ . . n .
For myself I accept my dismissal as an act
of arbitrary power, and I do so protesting that
the reasons offered were conceived to meet a
certain emergency, and that they never even
in your mind had a concrete basis. Very truly
yours, E. M. PEASE.
The original of those letters can be seen
upon any occasion grave enough to warrant
the Introduction of the writers into the out
spoken criticisms of this university. 1 1 have
withheld some for their Anglo-Saxon plain
ness of speech. The contest which I have been
making Is largely at the instigation of Ameri
can scholars and for the dignity of American
scholarship. \ I regret that I have failed to
bring Into plainer view the real issues In
volved. Â¦ ..
ACCEPTS HIS DISMISSAL.
. "It Is a pity that Mrs. Stanford's great gift
should be so mismanaged. Is there no way of
showing her that such methods react immedi
ately upon the good name of the university?"
"If this sort of thing is to be done, we must
tell them (the young men who are thinking of
Making university teaching . their profession)
that men with brains and consciences had bet
ter go into anything else In preference, and
leave university professorships to those who
are born to be time servers, and who will oc
cupy themselves, not m manly work In the line
of their ideals, but In. trying to. find out what
the- president- wants. President Jordan has
dealt a severe blow at, university life In this
country In general."
"Jordan will probably. demand your resigna
tion In writing: but he will assign false rea
sonsâreasons which he conceives will put you
to a disadvantage, if yon make them public.
He did this in a case last year â one that I
may not mention more specifically."
"Surely the annals of the universities in this
country can show no case of euch flagrant vio
lation of the principles of justice and. probity
as this.". â¢ â¢ . Â¦ , Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦<.,.. Â¦ .
"Every university man feels that you are
fighting his battle as well as your own."
'â¢â¢"If scholars are men of spirit and Indepen
dence of mind, they will surely hesitate to In
trust their careers to an institution In which a
request for a resignation can come for reasons
sn ill-defined as seem to be those alleged: in
your case."
"Acquiescence In the attitude of your uni
versity must lead in the long run (and not so
very long, either) to a distinct deterioration in
the. grade of men who will submit themselves
t.) a" career so precarious." Â¦ t
. "I had hoped thafthe odium which the action,
of President Jordan last year brought upon the
university in the eyes of all right-minded peo
ple would have prevented him. or. If not him,
at least the trustees. - from allowing any such,
action to again disgrace the-inÂ»titution." Â¦
"But what is Jordan thinking of? He is act
ing bo that Â¦self-respecting' men will . presently
prefer to dig dirt In the streets rather than go
to Stanford University." ' ' -
"I hesitate to Intrust to ink and paper my
estimate of the injury that such persistence In
what is certainly an evil policy must have on
thÂ« institution. Nothing but an emphatic and
very public reversal of the policy can save it."
Jf any defense were needed, I ' could cite the
resolution of my colleagues in view of your
criticisms passed in offering me the presidency
of the Philological Association In testimony, as
they expressed it. of "our, loyal friendship, . of j
our cordial fellow-feeling, our. high esteem of
his character and our sincere respect for his
scholarship and scholarly Ideals." .' .
I am persuaded that if I had meekly accepted
your dictation as to details in the conduct of
roy department upon which I am competent to
judge and j'ou are not, and especially if I had >
been one of. those who "stood /by" you in the
Ross'matter 1 should not have been disturbed,
as I confess I should have preferred not to be, j
having come here at your invitation and set
tled myself, as I supposed, "for life." Possibly I
I err in this.- but the gradual but . effective i
weeding out of the "Ross sympathizers" from ;
the university has produced such an lmpree- ,
sion, not only in my own mind, but In univer
sity circles^ - I have been- made aware of this
by Â¦ recent correspondence with university men
from jvhom I asked advice. I find the feeling
to be that there is not In the university such
academic freedom in any direction as self-re- j
specting and competent professors expect In all
universities. That this feeling is general may â¢
be Inferred from some extracts from recent let- I
ters to me from university men of the highest
standing: -
QUOTES EASTERN EDUCATORS.
tlon that you had. not understood what we were
doing, as Indeed your, letters made manifest.
It. Is true that. you once attributed eome fric
tion which then existed In my department to
me, but you subsequently explicitly and em
phatically acknowledged your error, confirming
the same by your letter of May 25, 1900. It Is
true that upon vour ; representation that Mrs.
Stanford felt injured at some alleged remarks
of mine in" connection with the Ross case I
called upon her, only to discover that she had
never thought of such a thing. As a matter of
fact my criticism was not of her but of you.
As to other vague allusions, I have no Idea to
what -you refer. .-"'.'.' . . .

If you will take my advice you 'will
Instruct your attorneys, to commence' suit
against that man for pay for youc serv-.:
kes.as housekeeper during all the time
you -were with hUn on Stockton street"
We came back here and I disposed of
a cottage at 37 Beaver street, which was
my own, and helped him start a lodeine
house at 332 Stockton street. A week or
su ago he tired of me and tried to make
me leave the house, and when I refused
he took legal steps.- He told me I was
pnjy a servant ana not his wife, and that
lie had a right to discharge me whenever
he pleased." â¢ . Â¦ â¢. â¢ -
After granting the injunction the Judge
said- to Mrs. Mixer: . -.- ~..-.c- -..-. Â¦ Â¦ .-
"He would not wait and pr availed upon
mf to consent to a marriage at Reno. We
started for Reno, gaing to Sacramento
and Stockton first. He used the name
of Fuller on his travels, though I object
ed. He prevailed upon me to take some
medicine In -Sacramento, and Â¦'Â¦ I immedi
ately became ill and dazed. When we left
the capital we rode for several hours on
the train and then got off at a small sta
tion which Mixer toid me was in Nevada
"He left me at the hotel to go. and get
a license, as he said, and that is all I re
membered until we started to return I
was dazed and incapable of thinking, and
believed him when he told me that we
had been married. â¢ Â¦ 1 - ..
Mrs. Mixer was the only witness in the
suit, and she told the following tale; â¢
"I was married to Mixer In 1882 and
lived with him until 1898, when I got a
divorce because of his cruel treatment.
He went East after the suit was decided
and remained there for several months,
having, as he told his friends, a very, good
time. He came back here and hunted me
up and told me that he still loved me and
atked me to remarry him, promising to
deed me half .of his property. I consent
ed, but asked him to wait until the year
the law requires should elapse after a
divorce. - Â¦ â¢ - >
Unfortunately the law is on his side
and adds to the burden of . woe. already
borne by the little woman. Â¦. :-
Judge I^ebbard thus rebuked George H.
Mixer yesterday after granting him an
injunction restraining his divorced wife
Nettie Mixer, from Interfering with him,
lii the conduct of a lodging-house at 332
Stockton street. â¢ - : - '' â¢ * 4
The rebuke was a deserved one, for
Mixer, after finding that the suit for an
injunction had been decided in his favor,
displayed a -great anxiety to get rid' of
Mrs. Mixer, arid asked the court to direct
her to remove "her belongings before next
Friday. /
The Mixer case is one of the most pecu
liar that has been heard at the City Hall
for some time, and' through it all it is ap
parent that Mrs. Mixer has been. the suf
lerer. . Believing herself to be , the ..wife of
Mixer, she has tolled and slaved to 'make
a success of his venture as a lodging
house keeper, and just when matters ap
peared to be running smoothly Mixer in
tormed her that he had not married her
and appealed to the law to get rid. of her.
"I want you to understand, Mixer, that
in rendering judgment in. your favor in
this suit I am not granting you a license
to annoy that little woman. If I hear of
your causing her any annoyance I shall
declare her a tenant of your house and
you will then have to resort to legal pro
ceedings to remove her."
"Mrs. â¢ Ezeta shows base- ingratitude,"
says Schumacher. "Why,- 1 advanced her
money, and fed her children when
they had nothing to eat. When. I asked
for the money owing on the jewelry she
sneered at ( me. But ' Ezeta is a gentle
man. If he had money to-morrow he
would pay air his obligations."
Carlos Ezeta, " deposed President of
Salvador^, and at one time worth millions
of dollars, was before Justice of the
Peace Daniels yesterday dn an order of
examination to show cause why he does
not pay a judgment for a laundry bill of
$65. / Ezeta's wife was also a defendant in
the action, brought by the'-Rauer Collec
tion Agency. .^ When Ezeta was put on
the stand he acknowledged that he owed
the bill, but pleaded that he was the pos
sessor of no real or^ personal property
whereby, the judgment could be satisfied.
Ezeta testified that his property in
Salvador had been confiscated and that
whatever property 'he ever had in this
country had been lost in ventures in Ala
meda County. At this; point "Jake"
Rauer produced a document purporting
to be a lease of some jewelry from H. G.
F. Schumacher, a jeweler in the Palace
Hotel, to Ezeta, to the effect - that ! after
the sum of $205 had been paid thereon,
the jewelry was to become the property
of Ezeta. - Ezeta stated that the jewelry,
consisting, of a watch, diamond ring, and
watch' fob, belonged to. him, but he had
pawned it to meet some pressing necessi
ties. - It developed that' the jewelry was
in the .possession of James M.. Ellis, .a no
tary public at 323 Montgomery -' street;
who had advanced Ezeta a sum of money
thereon. After Ezeta and his wife had
taken the pauper's oath Judge Daniels
discharged them .-from custody. -, .-
Schumacher, who sold the jewelry, says
that.it was not to be Ezeta's until the
latter had paid the sum agreed upon. The
first named knows nothing about the
pawning . of the . jewelry, but has placed
his bill in the hands of Thomas Mulligan
for collection. ,\ . . . ;

Commissioner Kirkpatrick remarked af
ter (he. reading that the report did not
give .the hnancial oata. demanded by the
resolution of the board. In otner woras,
it did not give the .Commissioners the in
formation as to the values of the changes
made in the specifications. He aid not
doubt some of the changes were 4in the
nature of improvements, but what he
wanted to know was the savings, cost
and et ceteras concerning the cnanges.
"If any one has been benefited by these
changes the board ought to know." was
Kirkpatrick's summing up. â¢
"It is clear from the report that "the
specifications were changed as charged "
remarked Kilburn. "The question is as
to the authority of the engineer in order
ing changes made without the sanction
of the board."
Attorney Budd, on being appealed to for
his opinion, said It was a matter of record
that no specifications could be changed
without the' consent of the board. ' This
was held when a former engineer maue
unauthorized changes. The engineer was
the absolute judge as to the necessity for
making changes/ but the board was the
absolute judge when it became necessary
to order them. â¢ â¢ - .
. Kirkpatrick expressed the view that the
board ought to have further data con
cerning the changes. He therefore de
manded that Norton file a supplemental
report showing in detail the difference in
expense, saving, etc., consequent upon the
changes made by Norton's order. -
Engineer Norton took the stand in his
own behalf. He said he had ordered cer
tain changes in the specifications, but
that he did so in order to improve the
character of the work, which was Buffer
ing by reason of faulty specifications. "
. ,"I now know that I was wrong in do
ing eo without consulting this board," he
admitted blandly. "I have given orders
that the work must proceed In future ac
cording to the specifications, no matter
what the results may be."
"You. should \ not have,.- ordered "any
changes without notifying this board of
your intention to do so," remarked Kil
burn. .
Norton went on to say that he was ig
norant of the responsibilities of *ls act
until The Call reminded him of the>inter
pretation'that might attach to his unau
thorized, procedure. ;Â¦.'- He . believed, the

CHIEF ENGINEER LOTT D.
NORTON, 'an appointee, of
Governor Gage to a responsi
ble position under -the State
Board of Harbor Commission
ers, made the humiliating con
fession at the meeting of the
board yesterday that he had changed the
specifications of certain wharf construe- j
tlon as charged by The Call, but asserted ,
that he had done so because the character |
of the work was improved thereby and
that no one connected with the work had
been financially benefited. . *
Norton tiled an evasive report, which
gave the members of the board little in
formation as to the cost of the changes
made by him without the slightest au :
ihority, and he was directed to prepare
a supplemental report giving the data re
quired. His admission that he had
changed the specifications, after denying
the fact on a previous occasion, was an
admission that the expose by The Call
of the loose methods of doing business on
the water front by the State officials was
justified and not barren of results. Nor
ton promised to change no more specifi
cations in the future of his own volition,
the board quietly intimating that the au
thority to do so was vested absolutely in
it ae a legally constituted body. Â¦
There were present at meeting yes
terday President Kilbutn. Commissioners
Kilpatrick and Mackenzie, Secretary
Bnglish and Engineer Norton. After the
transaction of routine business the chair
man called for the reading of Norton's
report. The report was couched in the
following language:
To the Honorable, the Board of State Har
bor Commissioners. â Gentlemen: I have the
honor to submit the following report in rela
'tion to the construction of the cylinder pier
wharves Noe. 19. 2i. 23 and 25. The two
former osm have, been finished. No. 23 is
under construction and pile drl\*ing in No. 25
Is now under way. These wharves have been
built as per plans and specifications adopted
by the board, with the exception of a few
minor details, namely: the length of piles
called for was found, when the. work of con
struction was commenced, to be too short:
they did not reach a foundation that would
sestain the load the wharf was required to
carry, therefore, longer piles .were substituted
that would give a safe and proper foundation.
TWÂ« has been done in the wharves so far
built.
In the middle portion of pier No. 21 it. was
found the cylinders as called for In the plans
were too long and could not be driven without
Injuring the -cylinder. At this place they, were
made shorter and a deduction for the amount
of same made in the contract price.*
In pier No. 23 it was found that the length
of the cylinder as called for was too short, and
it was necessary to lengthen them to make
them available.
The -fcpeciflcations called for filling the
cylinders within twenty-two feet of the top
v.-nh sacks partially filled with concrete from
that depth up; they are pumped out before
filling with loose "concrete. I found the method
of filling: with eacked concrete did not fill the
-v olds between the piles and sacks caused seams
in the concrete which in my Judgment is unsat
isfactory and unsafe construction. Therefore,
this method was Improved on by putting forty
to fifty partially filled sacks of concrete in the
bottom of the cylinders to' shut off the mud
from mixing with the concrete, then a trim
mer was placed in the cylinder and the con
crete deposited in the bottom of the cylinder
through the trimmer, thereby doing away with
the sacks except the number placed in the
bottom to shut out the mud. As the expense
of using the trimmer is equal to the cost of the
concrete in eacks there was no saving by the
contractor in making this betterment. -
The specifications call for eighteen feet of
rxpended metal cylinder placed two feet be-
Itw the top of the cylinder extending, down.
In placing the lower portion of expanded metal
'after cylinders were pumped out twenty-two
feet) it was found in many, cases (owing' to
the irregular driving of the piles in the cylin
ders) that there was ' not room to place the
expanded metal cylinder and then have suffi
cient ep*ce left to tamp the concrete. The
workmen la.- an effort to get the concrete in
place would Jam the limber metal in a way
that caused \olds and unfilled e paces '. In the
concrete which resulted In a class of concrete
that destroyed the value of . the Â¦Â¦ cylinder pier.
This, in my Judgment,, was too Important to
be allowed to continue. In cases of this kind,
the lower metal cylinders were omitted. From
extreme low tide to the top. of the- cylinder
Hers the expanded metal has been put in,
this portion of the cylinder being exposed to
the bumping and chafing of drift logs and
the portion that would derive , benefit by the
reinforcing of the expanded met* I.
The unused expanded metal is the property
ct the SUtte: the contractor would- not be bene
fited by ttje portion that was not. used. in
plw? Nos. 10 and 21. in the interior portion
of the wharves, the water was shallow,' 'and
to obtain a depth of two feet belpw the mud
line did not require but a depth of eighteen
to twenty-two feet in the cylinder, and in these
Â«nouÂ«h sacked concrete was used to I prevent j
" the mud from mixing with the concrete, and :
thÂ» cylinders were pumped dry and filled with
concrete aÂ« per plans and specifications.) ~ -

"I felt that my reputation was at stake,
and that the changes were an absolute
necessity," went on Norton. "As I have
pointed out, the work -was unsatisfactory
and I deemed it to be my duty as engin
eer to improve it if I could. In order to
prevent improper work from being done
I ordered certain changes in the specifi
cations. I now admit I was wrong in
doing so, and I assure you that it shall
not happen again."
With the filing by Norton next .Wed
nesday of his supplemental report giving
the data demanded by Kirkpatrlck the in
quiry by the board will probably end.
Both Kilb'urn and Kirkpatrick said after
the meeting that they ascribed no ulterior
motives to Norton in making the changes
pointed out by The Call, but that he had
simply erred in failln? to notify . the
board: Nevertheless, the cost and saving
effected by the changes would be rigidly
scrutinized, and if it were found that any
one profited by the changes summary ac
tion would be taken by the board. The
Commissioners will meet again next Wed
nesday mornlner.

The judge's action arose out of the cans
of. Michel Guillaume. arrested by Police

Peters testified that the defendant, lived
off .the earnings of Mary Duboce, a wo
man in Bacon place, and that there were
about thirty others of the same kind. At

call of the executive and State Central
committees the secretary, W. M. Cutter.
I proceeded to present the text of. the call
for Republican .State and district conven

pouching the Fifty-second Assembly Dis

I County, and the town of Berkeley were
given. two delegates and all that portion
of the city of Oakland lying within said
Assembly District was given eight,
whereas they, should have been consoli
dated and given ten.. This amendment
was carried during the reading of the call
As soon as the secretary finished, W. S
Wood moved that where the space was
left- vacant for the date of the convention
the 25th of August should be Inserted and
Secretary. Cutter moved that Sacramento
should fill 1 in the blank left for the city
where the convention should be held.
Both of these motions were unanimously
carried. . ' *
A. B. Truman then made a motion that
the- call' as amended should be adopted

Watt of San Francisco wanted that part
of the call as recommended which reads
as follows stricken out: . \

KNIGHT'S FIGHT.
It Is practically settled, moreover, that
the - Republican citizens who , are now
waging . a battle for clean government
and honest administration of State af
fairs will organize the convention by
electing as chairman the Hon. Jacob H
Neff. of Placer. The despondent and de
moralized supporters of the Gage ma
chine may not put forward, an opposi
tion . candidate. The indications are - that
Gage's candidacy, will be an Incident of
the past before the, convention as
sembles.
The retirement of Gage, however, will
not signify (the utter collapse of the ma
chine. The 'scattered Gagellngs will prob
ably rally around some ottier aspirant in
the boss camp. Last night the report
was . current., in political circles that
Johnny Mackenzie had been assigned to
the duty of managing the flght for the
machine forces in Sari Francisco. It was
said that Dan Burns had- positively re
fused to manage the Gage fight in this
city. Another version of the story was
that Burns had not declined to manage
Gage's fight, but that the Governor's ad
visers had strenuously objected to tne
Burns management, and therefore the
selection of Mackenzie to rally .the push.
vThe immediate friefhds and counselors of
Burns are extremely bitter against

Albert Albright, a grocer's clerk, who
almost lost his life when Walter Johnson
was drowned, told a graphic story to the
Coroner'^ jury yesterday morning In
which he described the most thrilling
episode of his experience. . ...
He was taking a walk, he said, along
the seawall on the . evening of May G
when he saw a naphtha launch, the
Scout, at a landing place about to start
for a vessel in the stream. Walter
Johnson, a nineteen-year-old boy, was
engineer, and the other â¢ occupant was
captain of the British bark Socotra, which
was' then lying in the stream. Albright
asked them to give him a ride, and/they
consented. When the launch was within
one hundred.', yards of the ship the en
gine broke down and in response to their
signals of distress a boat put out from
the Socotra and took oft the captain and
his luggage. Johnson and Albright
begged the captain to help them on
board or send a boat, to -land them ashore,
the launch being unmanageable, but the
captain heartlessly refused. Finally .they
hauled up the anchor and paddled toward
the wharves, but they made but little
headway and were* obliged to let go the
anchor again. Albright warned Johns Dn
that the launch was lying' directly in the
track of the Sausalito ferry-boat, but
Johnson Insisted that he ! was mistaken
and refused to hoist the anchor. ' Shortly
afterward Albright saw the lights of the
steamer Tamalpais bearings down . upon
them and he tried to attract attention by
burning a newspaper,' but the wind blew
out his matches, and -there being no
lights on the launch, the steamer struck
the frallcraft upsetting It and throwing
it aside. Albright had not had time to
take off his coat or shoes and sank sev
eral feet below the surface of the 'waves.
Being a good swimmer he rose again and
caught hold of the bottom of the launch.
At that moment the paddle wheel of the
Tamalpais struck the launch, and broke
It into a thousand pieces. Johnson was
.hanging on near the engine -at the time
and must have .been struck by the wheel,
for Albrierht never saw him again.' Al
bright held on to a floating piece of wood
until rescued by a boat that. had put out
from the Â¦ steamer. . . ; .

times and had many thrilling experiences

He and his brother William left home
for the far Northwest in April, 1846. On

Dr. Whitman in the Walla Walla Val

DEATH OF PIONEER
The flowers that are not In root will be
taken to-day to the Presidio Hospital and
distributed among the soldier invalids. : .
Before the closing of the exhibition Mr.
Smith distributed the prizes and' offered
a few words of congratulation and en
couragement to the successful competi
tors.
In view of the threatened and ruthless
extinction of the wild flowers of Califor
nia, Emory E. Smith, president of. the so
ciety, gaye out last evening the determin
ation of the officers and members to en
courage the children of the State to care
for and protect the meadow and moun
tain flora. The first step in showing ap
preciation in that important direction was
taken last evening when little Miss . Lou
isa Dorothy Bestery received the society's
ribbon and clasp for the school children's
wild flower exhibit. Furthermore, next
year it is the intention of the society to
offer the children special prizes for wild
flowers. Mr. Smith, Mrs. J. R. Martin,
Mrs. W. S. Chandler, Mrs. L..' O. Hodg
kins will take that special matter in
hand and the exhibit, it is hoped, will be
one of the main features of future flower
shows. ' Â¦ :
There were many regrets expressed last
night when the annual ' spring exhibition
oi the. California . State Floral Society
brought its fine show tp a close. The
ladies, however, who have been indefati
gable in their efforts to present the city
with a floral display that could not be
excelled in any part of the world,
breathed a long sigh of relief as the last
notes Â¦ of "The . Star-spangled Banner"
were played by the band of the Pensa
coia, tor it meant to them a : respite for
a year from those arduous duties attend
ant on a public function of such magnlÂ»
tude, and^ responsibility. vÂ»- ! .
The crush aurinsj the day spoke the ap
preciation of the citizens; the attendance
of those connected with the public schools
and institutions was testimony to the im
portance of the remarkable show from in
educational standpoint, and the presence
of so many engaged in the study of bot
any was evidence of the usefulness and
value of the varied display. Â¦ â¢ :Â¦Â¦-,
Though it was the lasi day there were
ihcse who felt the exhibition of so great
hnportance as to send further exhibits for
inspection. Among the late senders was
Dr. Harry L. Tevis, who exhibited an ex
quisite lot of Spanish iris. The doctor
Â¦was rewarded with a silver medal for the
dainty arrangement and variety of his
exhibit. A diploma was, awarded Paul
Morris for Mariposa County for the
llowers sent, and Mrs. J. Cook of Yosem
ite Valley for her rare exhibit of wild
flowers also received the. '.society's di
ploma. George B. Jones of Sausalito won
a diploma for a vase of beautiful Captain
Christie roses, and a certificate of merit
was awarded Mrs. Joseph Sexton of
Santa Barbara for her exhibit of outdoor
grown tropical fruits and flowers.

If this offer doesn't bring you here
bright and early to-morrow morning
then you must be bargain proof. The
Paris models dictated the styles and
the hats are so recently from the
work-rooms that the first bloom of
their loveliness hasn't had time to
rub off. No use to attempt a descrip-
tionâtheir beauty and daintiness baf-
fles type. But the pleasure of a sur-
prise awaits you when you come.

VT L% 1 1 1 1 which will be paid to any person who can find that the abore testimonial letters
Â¦ fÂ» IE are not genuine, or were published before obtaining the writer's special per-
VV VV V mission. Ly dia E. Pinkham Medicine Co., Lynn, JMLaca.
"Will not the volumes of letters from women who have been
made strong- by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound con-
vince others of the virtues of this great medicine ?
When a medicine has been successful in more than a million
cases, is it justice to yourself to say, without trying it, "I do not
believe it would help me"?
Surely you cannot wish to remain weak and sick and dis-
couraged, exhausted with each day's work. If you have some
derangement of the feminine organism try Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound. It will surely help you. â¢
**. Dz^&B Mks. Pixkuam : â I have suffered for four years with pain in my
back, and a terrible bearing--down feelinjj in the lower part of my bowels, and
at times the abdomen seems to swell and. becomes very sore. I have terrible
sharp pains in my ovaries and am very nervous, also troubled with leucorrhoea
and irregular menstruation. I have started to take Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, but I do not feel much better, so I thought 1 would
Â¦write and ask you what to do. Please answer soon, as I am a great sufferer
and long 1 to gÂ«t relief." â Mbs. Richard Dixon, 11 Farewell St., Newport, K.I.
(Jan. 11, ii>00.)
" Dear Mes. Pixkham: â I want to thank you for your letter of advice. Since
taking- your Vegetable Compound, Liver Pills, and using- your Sanative Wash,
as directed by you, my backache and terrible pains in ovaries have disap-
peared. I feel that your Vegetable Compound should be used by all weak
women." â Mbs. Richard Dixox, 11 Farewell St., Newport, R.I. (April 11, 1901.)
Mrs. Richard Dixon wrote to Mrs. Pinkham when she was in great

If there is anything in your case about which you would
like special advice, write freely to Mrs. Pinkham. No man will
see your letter. She can surely help you, for no person in America
has such a wide experience in treating- female ills as she has had.
Address is Lyun, Mass. ; her advice is free and helpful.
No woman ought to arrive at this terrible state of misery , because
these symptoms are a sure indication of womb troubles. She must
remember that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is almost
an infallible cure for all female ills, such as irregularity of periods, which
cause weak stomach, sick headache, etc., displacvments and inflammation
of the wombj or any of the multitudes of illnesses which beset the
female organism.
One day she is wretched and utterly miserable : in a day or two she
is better and laughs, at her fears; thinking there is nothing much the
matter after all; but before night the deadly backache reappears, the
limbs tremble, the lips twitch â it seems as though all the imps of
Satan were clutching her vitals; 'she goes to pieces and is flat on her
back. .
How much harder the daily tasks become when some derangement
of the female organs makes every movement painful and keeps the
nervous system all unstrung ! > ,
The ordinary eveiy-day life of most of our women is a ceaseless
treadmill of work. . '

In the several Eastern oil fields last
month there were completed 679 wells,
bringing in new production amounting In
the total to 6140 barrels. In the month of
March there were completed 514 wells and
these added to the production the amount
of 6336 barrels. â¢Â¦ .
There is one oil well in the Kern River
field that is controlled by a single in
dividual. This is the Grossmayer well on
section 31-2S, 2S. Grosmayer has a tract
of ten acres under his control in the dis
trict. His first well is performing all
right and he will sink a second one.
It will be the largest in the field. The diam
eter of the pipe will be six inches. The com
pany putting it in will have & storage capac
ity of 2o.ooo barrels at the railroad. The
route to the railrt>ad will be changed if pos
sible so as to have St. Paul connect with the
line. The promoters expect to have the line
rtady by November. Fresno, San Francisco,
Philadelphia and San Francisco. York, Coal
inga and other oil companies are mainly inter
ested in putting In the line.
Concerning the new pipe une from the
Soilthwest Coalinga field the Fresno
Democrat says:
Adjoining the Maricopa holdings are some
of the best producers or the Sunset field, and
it is said that many have already agreed to
co-operate In the new enterprise.
Several attempts have been made to con
solidate the feunset operators In a proposition
for the erection of a refining plant. None has
been succestful, but theie Is still hope. An
other eflort ie being made to consolidate. This
Is dine by Dr. O. B. Bachman and others, who
hope to be able to establish a. , plant on the
property of the Maricopa Company. Dr. Bach
man has been lu the city obtaining figures from
local firms on the cost of erecting a plant that
will have a capacity of 450 barrels a day. Un
der present terms lt Is believed that the greater
part of the capital will come from Minneapolis,
although Sunset operators will be interested.
Oil drillers will soon be working in the
district southwest of the Sunset field and
in the country lying between the San
Joaquin and Santa Maria valleys, 'iwo
concerns are ready to put up rigs. The
tendency to branch out into new Holds
and to consolidate is manifest. The gen
era", reason is that the conditions look Get
ter on the whole j than they did some
months ago. The surplus of the Los An
geles field has been diminished by fully
50,000 barrels by orders for fuel oil placed
in the "Arizona mines. Consolidations
have been effected that lessen the compe
tition and take away some of the dangers
that beset the market a few months ago.
While the prices for oil are low", no one
believes that they Will hold as low as now
in the immediate future. The consolida
tion of interests of the Summerland dis
trict is reported to be in sight. . * .
There are two stories of some import
ance in circulation in Bakersfield thfit af
fect the interests of the Kern County oil
fields. One of these is that promoters of
the proposed electric line to the coast
ircm the Sunset district have made con
tracts with parties who have oil to ship
to give them a rate of 15 cents to tide
water with an additional charge of IVi
cents per barrel to San Francisco or Los
Angeles by steadier. The other is that at
least two schemes are on foot to establish
oil refineries in the Kern River fleld. One
of these is reported to be promoted by T.
r. Spiers and the other is the King re
finery project, which has reached the
stage of selecting a site near the railroad.
The producers of the Sunset field may
unite to put up a refinery in the field.
The attempt has not been abandoned,
pr. O. Bachman and others are working
on a plan for combination. The Los An
geles Times says:
Preparations for actual dredging at La
Grange are being rushed by Messrs. Doq
little, "Wiltse. Brown and others. S One
steam drill is running and two others
wiH be put at work. The company has
bonded 1400 acres of gravel. There will be
I7Vz miles of ditch, carrying 5000 inches of
water. An electric power plant will be
constructed at La Grange". The Tuol
umne Independent reports a rumor that
the Jumper mine is. about to be sold. Con

The Plumas Independent reports that at

for mining in Plumas County equaled that
of the immediate future. In Onion Vallev
and along" the Slate Creek basin miners
are preparing for the early run. The Plu

ments to start up its old mill on custom
rock and also to operate largely on it*

The Redding Searchlight says:
The new dre<lge at Teat's Flat was seti in
operation Monday and later was closed down
for a few n-.irior repairs, resuming operations
yesterday. The Risdon lion Works will run
the machine for several weeks before it is turn
ed over to the Syndicate Dredging Ccmpany
for which it was built. This makes the third
dredge operating hereabouts, and another is
now under construction. The dredge has ca
pacity about three times that of the one now
operating at Mississippi Bar. The size of the
hull of the boat If 86x30 feet. Electric power
will be used to operate the machinery, there
being six motors, consuming a current of 200
horse-power. Three shifts of three men are
required to operate the boat and fifteen men
will be given employment.
The Flacerville Xugget says
DREDGE IS OPERATING.
According to the Yreka Journal, an Ore
fron company has taken out $45,000 from
the old China Oak claim at Happy Camp
Fiskiyou County. McBride & Stewart are
prospecting the Williams mine on the
north fork of the Humbug. All the placer
mining companies at Hawkinsville will
rir.ish ground sluicing directly and begin

r/orted to have been struck at Greenhorn.
The Baltimore mine near Forest Hill "a
running with fifteen men at work says
the Colfax Sentinel. The main working
tunnel of the Bob Lewis gravel mine had
been extended to 1330 feet. â¢An Eastern
company, under an agreement to pur
chase, is developing the proprty.
The Arnador Ledger says that Ballard
&. Martin have bonded a tract of land
north of the Bay State mine to Hay ward
& Lane for mining purposes, whicn em
braces about 160 acres and takes in one
rsile of the lode line. Men are working
tnd wlh sink a shaft. Forty of the sixty
stamps at the Oneida mill have been
working. Large bodies of low grade ore
are in sight in that mine, but the Ledger
rays that they are of too low grade to
be worked profitably. The South Spring
Hill mine has recently changed owners.
The mill has temporarily suspended op
erations. The company will be reorgan
ized.
The Redding Free* Press says that the
Great Western Gold Company has filed
deeds ehov.ing ownership of the Liberty
group of claims at Copley, and has also
1 urchased a site for ..e purpose of erect
ing a smelter.
Since 1S96 there had been scarcely any pro
duction of v chromite in the United States, until
1901. when California produced 3CS long tons,
\aJued at $o790. The imports of chrome ore in
1601 were 20,112 long tens, valued at $305,001.
*s compared with 15,793 long tons, valued at
I2S4.825. in 1900. The domestic production will
probably increase considerably in the immeci
ate future.
PKOPEKTIES .CHANGE OWNERS.
Chromite has been found in quantity in
Penntylvania. Maryland, North Carolina and
Caiifomia. The North Carolina deposits are
near Burnsville, Vancey County; near Dark
Riose trestle, on Dark Rldg:Â« Creek, Jackson
County; and sixteen miles northwest of Ashe
ville on Big Ivy Creek, Buncombe County. The
California deposits are luund m Alauwda, Ca!
aveias, Del Norte, Fresno, Mendocino, N'apa,
Placer. San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara, Shafcia,
Sierra, Sonoma and Tehama counties. By far
the greater jjart oÂ£ the ohromlte used in the
United States is brought directly from the de
j)O6:t6 in Asiatic Turkey. The New Caledonia
deposits are beginning to be worked to some
considerable extent; the Canadian chromite de
posits in the Black Lake region of the prov
ince of Quebec, and the deposits of Bluff Head,
en Port aoi Port Bay, west coast of New
foundland, are also producing. The value of
chrome ore depends upon its percentage of
chromic oxide. The standard ore contains Oti
per cent of oxide, and increases in value from
75 cents to $1 per ton for every unit above 0O
per cent, the price decreasing in much greater
proportion for every unit below 50 per cent.
Copper continues to hold Its full share
Â«i public attention on the Pacific Coast-
California prospectors are out In many
counties looking for the red metal and
the maps and registers of the State Min
ing Bureau are bringing notice to many
cections. According to the Shasta County
papers, the Mountain Copper Company
has made a great success during the last
year, even taking into consideration the
demoralized condition in which the cop
per market has been. A new discovery
of importance is reported to have been
made in Alaska at the head of the Tanana
River, in the Nutzotin Mountains, where
there is a copper belt that is reported to
extend a distance of something like forty
ir-iles to the head of the Nabesna River.
No one imagines that the copper possi
bilities of the coast have been realized in
even the most remote degree.
Something of interest to the copper
miners of the coast appears in the forth
coming report of the United States Gco
lceicai Survey on the mineral resources
of the United States, in which Dr. Joseph
Hyde Pratt deals with ihe chromites oi
California, which, he thinks, shouid be
made of value in the copper districts of
this ccast. Dr. Pratt writes In part as
follows:

There were a number of special movements

The -Financier says this week: The state
ment of the New York Associated Banks last
week showed an Increase of $4,825,200 In cash,
or $1,019,200 less than the amount estimated
on the basis of the traceable movements of
money during the week. The discrepancy would
seem to indicate that, the statement was made
upon rising averages for cash. The loans were
reduced by $8,546,600, making a reduction for
the two weeks of $31,454,700. At the corre
sponding period last year, it may be noted, the
banks reported a decrease of $14,700,000 in
loans, making for the fortnight $38,900,000. At
that time the loss in this Item was due prin
cipally to liquidations following the crisis early
in the month; now the loss seems to have been
largely due to the transfer of collateral to Eu
rope, the loans by domestic bankers based. there
having been paid oft and Â¦ settlement effected
with London or Continental houses. It appears
ftuite possible, however, that the decrease in
oans last week was in part due to the payment
by Investors of loans upon securities which
they took out of the market, intending to hold
the properties until a. more favorable oppor
tunity occurred for. realizing thereon. The de
posits of the banks decreased $4,410,900. The
loss of loans, less the gain In cash, however
called for a- reduction of but $3,694,400. conse
quently' the statement Is somewhat out of har
mony. The required reserve was reduced $1,
102,725, which added to the gain In cash makes
an Increase of. $5,954,925 in surplus reserve
This item now stands at $14,301,450 against
$21,288,955 with the corresponding date last
year. The week's clearings show* decrease of
$142,000,000. following a reduction of $115,000 -
OOO-tn the previous week, reflecting In a great
part the smaller volume of transactions on the
Stock Exchange. ThÂ« most important changes

vious week's statement, were by four of the

"In the western section It wa* too wet and
cool for rapid growth of anything except grass
and clover. On the uplands potatoes have
grown fairly well. Potato planting is not en
tirely finished on lowlands. The fruit outlook,
which has been very promising, is. no longer
60 good. Prunes, cherries and pears have been
dropping badly. The Injury is ascribed to the
cold raips. ,
â¢'Fsr'.y fruits have gone out of bloom and
apples are now coming Into bloom. Gardens
are backward.
"The correspondents of the eastern counties
rÂ«?port that all crops ar making satisfactory
progress. Wheat has stooled out well and
rooted strongly. In come localities fall \rheat
ie six to eighteen Inches high and in seme
places it is "in the boot." Alfalfa Is about
six Inches hlg-h and growing finely. In Lin
coln and Adams counties, where there .was
moEt injury to winter wheat by freezing, that
â¢which was not resowed will probably be half
a crop: that rwowed will be considerably bet
ter. In general, the prospect for wheat crop
is excellent.
"After the first two days the weather be
came quite cool for the season. In the eastern
section showers were frequent anl copious,
while in the western section there was too
much rain. It fell every day of the week ex
cept the last.

There has been a quiet speculation in stocks
this week, as is natural to the season and the
various factors of uncertainty in the situation:
But with the exception of a period of positive
weakness during the first two hours of the
week's trading the undertone of the market
has been firm and unevenly strong. Prices are
quite materially higher for the week. This is
in large part due to the easier condition of the
money market, which has shown the results
of the attraction of the funds from our domes
tic centers and from foreign money markets by
the recently prevailing high rates for money.
The rates for call loans have settled down for
the week to below 4 per cent, and contrary
to the general expectation the rate for foreign
exchange has not responded with any material
advance. It was feared that the flret show of
east in the local money market would lead
to the withdrawal of funds placed here to take
advantage of the more profitable interest rate.
The fact Is that the large demands made upon
Paris and Berlin for New York account made
an insignificant impression upon money rates
at those centers, and there is still sufficient
profit to keep foreign loans in this market.
The pressure upon speculative buyers In the
securities market has been relaxed and the
process of weeding out undesirable collateral
in loans has apparently been completed. The
memory of this process still remains and is an
element of the animation which is manifest
in the character of the trading. With the ex
ception of the anthracite' miners' strike gen
erai conditions have been bo favorable that the
provision of better credit facilities has en
couraged the confident holding of stocks and
has made the market sensitive to light demand.
The damage done by the suspension of work
in the coal mines and the restriction of sup
ply is undeniable. The effect is perceptible,
especially in the iron and steel trade, and has
caused the iron and steel stocks to ehare to
some extent, in the depression of the coalers.
The heaviness of the United States Steel stocks
was associated also with the protests entered
oy some of the minority stockholders at the
meeting to ratify the stock conversion and
bend issue plan. Speculative holders of these
stocks were alarmed on Monday by rumors of
tne. formation of a powerful bear party and
by the sharp break in the quotation for the
new bonds when issued, which are dealt in on
the curb. Support was forthcoming, however,
and a steadier tone developed. The news from
the crop regions is attentively studied and has
not been unfavorable to stock values. The
stocks affected by the copper industry have
led . b y Amalgamated- Copper on the ad
vancing tendency and reported increasing de
mand for raw copper. The firmer tendency in
the silver market has also benefited some of

The report that the control of Louisville and
Nashville, and, in consequence, the Chicago,
Indianapolis and Louisville, are, in a measure,
contingent and dependent on holdings under op
tions and FUggest possible complications. The
weather map was construed as favorable to
crop prospects, although showers in the North
west are not dried at this time. The bank
ftatement shows an encouraging recuperation
of reserves, but neither the increase in cash nor
the reduction in loans was fully up to the ex
pectations formed by the street. The effect
on the market was, therefore, scarcely per
ceptjble. The market closed about steady.

Each crate contained 24 baskets, which were

There is still some uncovered short Interest
in May and the local operator to whom these
deliveries are due controls the cash property
and is in complete control of. the situation.
We see no object therefore In standing out on
short sales for this month's delivery. The July

this has the encouragement of a good cash de

The effect of this on the market early, was the
same as In wheat. There was some selling
pressure at the opening, but later the. market
turned strong. Speculative operations continue
on a very moderate scale, however, and the
movement Is so small as to have little effect

WHEATâ Liverpool . futures ' were lower. ThÂ«
French markets were unchanged.
Chicago opened weak on the Government re
port and fine weather, for the crops. The Gov
ernment report made the crop figures generally
larger than expected. Snow's report estimated
the winter wheat crop at 400,000,000 bushels.
The quantity remaining in farmers' hands is.
normal. Minneapolis stocks decreased 980,477
bushels. There was a good snipping demand,
and New Yort reported 60 loads taken for ex
port. â¢ Â¦ ' . Â¦' Â¦' Â¦Â¦ v ' â¢ - , -
The Chicago letter of Bolton. de Ruyter &
Co. said: "Market here opened weak. The
increase in the Government's estimate of last
year's crop induced a good deal Â¦ of realizing.
Later, however, the trade was ' more disposed
to modify their feeling In regard to the re
port. The second judgment is that the In
crease Is a relative one." The department is
manifestly trying to harmonize the basis of
Its estimates with the basis of the Census Bu
reau. If they originally underestimated this
crop, they have, by the same process of figur
ing, been underestimating previous crops. It
naturally follows all this that if production has
been underestimated, consumption has been
underestimated also. The market turned firm
later on this conclusion, and' also on reported
liberal export demand , at ihe seaboard, with
the large clearances for the day. The weather
continues in the main favorable for this crop,
the Southwest reports inci easing farmers' de
liveries, and some sources in the Northwest also
indicate an increase in the movement there.

Butter was firmer, dealers quoting 21c for the

The Dairy Exchange did not make Its usual
quotations yesterday, and will not probably for
some time to come. , Indeed, there are hints
that Â¦ it will not make any more at any time.
There were also reports that a number of
houses would resign from the body, but these
rumors could not be positively verified. Inquiry
among 1 the members elicited ' the Information
that some of them have for months been dis
satisfied with doing business on fixed quota
tions established by the dairy trade as a body,
and desire to buy and sell on their own indi
vidual prices. Be this as it may, It is certain
that the condition of the exchange is one of in
decision at the moment, and what it will do
in reeard to the future is very uncertain. An
account of the matter appears in the local
columns.

showed many little favors. She seemed to
filow a great regard for me. She told mÂ». of
her wonderful secret, about her possession of
a rr.aeica! handkerchief. She showed me to
my astonishment and amazement the controll-
ing influence over others by any one possess-
ing- this handkerchief, and in parting with
her 3he insisted that 1 1 carry ilcng with me
as her great token of regard and love for me
a quantity of these' handkerchiefs, with the
secret of -this Egyptian maiden.
