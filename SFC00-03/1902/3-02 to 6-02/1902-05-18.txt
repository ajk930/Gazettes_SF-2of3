ducks, piques and cheviots of all kinds.
It is a noticeable fact that black and

black and white, and the lovely creamy

Petticoat Ideas.

In petticoats there are so many novel
iies that oae might call for an inexhausr

them. '1 he petticoat with the upper part

is being iaid away until cooler v.eather.
In trimming your next bit of underwear
try this method of treating the lace. Let.
it be an inexpensive novelty lace or an
imitation, and follow the plan of outlin
ing the figures with coarse wash silk. Go
around them in a running stitch and
when you have linished note the elegant
appearance the lace will have.
It will look curiously like net lace with
appliqi;ed figures; and the beauty of it is
mat it will luunder a thousand times as
well after the treatment, so that the tec
onu estate of that lace will be better than
the tirsc.
Colored Underwear.
This young- woman has built her trous
fceau entirely in those heavenly twins,
pink and blue. One can get mulls and
Swisses, batistes and linens, and the most
de.Lics.te silks m these colors, and > this
Paris bride < bought them exclusively. In
ail htrr trousseau tru-re is nothing white.
The trimming's on her pink and. blue lin
gerie are white lace, but this is darned,
outlined, corded and maimed with nai-
Idw wnite wash ribbons or with coarse
ihreaus of white bilk or white linen, to
make it strong and pretty.
There is really little netd of studying
the fashions iu underwear unless one can
learn something new, something to one's
edification. It is therefore with pleasure
that one peruses an account of the lin
gerie of a Parisian bride, a young woman
who is well known in the American col
cny abroad, and who was one of the prin
cipals at the wedding of the Countess of
feneoxd, formerly Jiiss Morton.
The latest garters are of elastic in the
round -the-leg style. They are embroider
ed with pink silk roses and there Is a nar
row runie of chiffon along each edge
Those who do not wear this persuasion of
carters can work the long .side elastics
with roses and border them with chiffon
edgings. The elastics are hitched to the
iroin of the corset and are worn very
thort, to pull down the abdomen.
By the same Invisible but wholly reli
able source one learns that there are new
things under the gown In the matter of
garters.

iht that they act as shirr strings
and trimmings, too.
Just why. or with what utilitarian pur
pose in view it 1s not known, but the
latest French skirts show a trimming to'
imitate the outer skirt. The Spanish
flounce, widening in the back; the little
chiffon plaiting shirred down the middle;
the bands of stitched silk and the applica
tion of flowers are all noted in tho petti
coat as in the outer skirt. â¢ /
It is a .charming summer ' trousseau
which has a petticoat for every dress,'
trimmed to imitate the outer skirt and
either exactly matching it in material or
harmonizing .with it. - Â¦
The princess . petticoat, while the most
desirable thing to be found in underwear,
has Its objection from the standpoint of
economy, lielng all of a piece, a com
bination garment, it must be laundered all

piece. -This Is 1 very destructive and Â¦ the

loudly that witlrÂ»the cloth, the pongee,*
the poplin, the linen, and the moire there
should be a petticoat of the same stuff.
The entire cloth petticoat is a little too;
warm, but to it there can be added a deep
flounce of silk, so that while' the under
part is cashmere or veiling, or whatever
It may be. the outside is of silk. This
adds only a little to the weight, but much

from across tho khz* there comes the
f-lalrr. that it wa*> the special thought of
the CounteBB of Warwick, a woman who
for originality in dress is ae renowned as
for her beauty. The Countess Is famous
for her band>ome petticoalB and carries
always a trunk of them, even on a Sat
urday to Monday visit.
It K'vnf a little odd, almost indelicate
to speak no openly of. the pettiroat as a
visible part of one's wardrobe, for al
ways it has been a eub rosa adjunct, or
partially so. But the long skirt has ban-
Ifhed concealment from the petticoat and
the fact that it is to trail, while the dress
skirt is hfld up, brings It prominently be
fore the public eye.

wash dress.
Or it is In brown, or black, or navy

the dark silk or cloth gown. . - -
The fancy for matching the petticoat
to the dress skirt is on the increase. In
gplte of the fact that all the better dress
skirts have their silk drop skirts, there
must be a petticoat underneath of pre
cisely the same color. : ' â¢'
Not only must the tone correspond, but
th* material must raatrb*. t
With a silk dress there must be a pÂ«ttl-
mired, and that is so necessary.
Still another, skirt that asks for recog
nition is the one that Is made without
fullness of any sort, front or back, until
within a few. inches of the- floor. This is
the sheath skirt with a vengeance, and a
tailor who makes a specialty of this tight
skirt actually fitted one so snugly that his
poor victim cannot' be seated. -Though in
the skirt she is stunning, it is doubtful
Ir many would care to risk such a gar
ment.- , -. , _ ,s-; ..... ... . Â¦*Â«>â¢;
By far the greater number of good: tail
ors and dressmakers advocate the skirt
that has a box plait in the back, stitched
perhaps to hold it fiat, but giving a lit

There is a pretty finish that is used for
negligees of all ports. It is the ribbon
chou made. a little differently. The rib
bon is- 1 knotted In a, hard full knot and
.from it hang no less than twelve ends.
These' are cut diagonally, and a single
knot :1s tied in each one an. inch from the
end of the ribbon. Until you have made
one of these ohoux you cannot guess how
very pretty it is. It trims the corset cover
. prettily, and, if made of very soft ribbon,
it takes , up no room, v. For the nightie it
is- quite ideal, for it . .gives . that long,
graceful line that Is in. keeping, and for
the room robe it is also very pretty.
-The beauty. of the new muslins have en

Listen, then, to what Oronhyatekha has
done:
He has measured success by the white
man's mark and has brought himself to
the highest notch of it.
Born on the Mohawk reservation at*
Bradford. Ontario, more than half a cen
tury ago. Oronhyatekha earned for hlm-\
self an education not less than the best.
He is an Oxford graduate and a graduate
of the Toronto University of Medicine.
For, twenty-five years Oronhyatekha
practiced medicine in Canada and' the
United States, nor was he content .until
be stood at the head of his profession.
For twenty-one years Oronhyatekha
has been supreme chief ranger of the In
dependent Order of Foresters. . Taking
hold of the order when after seven years
of struggling existence it was at. the last
gasp, he revived It, effected a reorganiza
tion and placed it on a basis that makes
the present surplus in the treasury five
and a quarter million dollars, with double .
that amount paid out in premiums. Be
sides he is a thirty-third degree Mason
and. an Odd Fellow. " - . . â¢.> . '

As a boy Oronhyatckha went to the
reservation school, and he was not yet
15 years old when he ran away from the

Wllbraham, Mass., where he spent two
years in, the Wesleyan College. * â¢

where the ' brilliantly decorated foreign

Napoleon wished to form a society In' the

been decorated. Th* two San Franciscans
that have been recognized In this way
are Dr. C. H. Brigham and Major Rath
bone'
During the Franco-Prussian war Dr.
Brigham was appointed surgeon in chief
of the Forrest School, at Nancy. He also
had charge of the ambulance at Nancy.
His endurance, his couraK* and his cool
ness at all times won him recognition, and
the French Government was glad to show
Us appreciation, remembering the words
of Napoleon, their founder, "It is to the
efforts of such men that we owe the ex
istence of our nation."
Major Rathbone was Consul General in
Parts, where his broad-mindedness and
fairness won the approval of all and were
rewarded In a signal manner when " he
was decorated with the badge of the Le
gion of Honor.
France is the only nation in the world
that possesses an order based solely on
honor. It recognises merit, whether on
military, civil, scientific, commercial or
benevolent lines. The walk in life does
not count as long as merit marks the ef
fort, for the brave hero In time of war
to the faithful servant In time of peace
are recognized as members of this aris
tocracy that is purely a republican Insti
tution.
Napoleon said when he proposed the in
stitution that he wished to create an or
der which should replace the arms of
honor, which should have the advantage
of being given to the soldier as well as to
the general, to the' peaceful servant as
well as to the . military man, which
should be made manifest In the form of
decorations, which were then worn
throughout Europe. He wished that the
private soldier when he returned from his
Held of action should feel in a substantial
way the efforts of his bravery.
The originality of the Idea of an order
based on such a thing as merit was too
much for the new republic and it roused

men and two Americans.
fiylvain Weill of Stein. Slmda & Co. was
president of the French Hospital at the
time the new building was constructed,
and Mr. Welll's efforts were recognized
by the French Government when he was
made one of the Legion of Honor, a so
ciety that has embraced the useful, brave
and faithful of the eons of France for
the last century.
A. Legallet of the Legallet-Hellwig' Tan
ning Company has beea looking out for
the Interests of France along commercial
lines. He was made counselor of com
merce for the Government of France in
the United States. There are but two
others In the United States that enjoy
this distinction. One Is at the port of
New Tork and the other at Chicago. Be
sides Ms commercial work Mr. Legallet
has been prominent In French charity as
sociations. It was in 1900, when he was
appointed juror to the exposition at Paris,
that he was decorated with the badge of
the Legion of Honor.
B. Dallemagn*. the Trench Consul Gen
eral, has devoted the best years of his
life to the Interests of his countrymen In
foreign lands. It was In recognition of
his many years ef faithful service In the
consular service that Franca made him

The first step in the order is knight

may be granted after four years of

are of five kinds, according to the > fiW

girls go to the one that corresponds to>

One day when Napoleon was at Bou

personally the decoration of his brave
soldiers with the Cross of the Legion,
he was riding with the artillery when hÂ«
stopped, dismounted and asked the artil
leryman if be could try a shot at a ship
lying in the harbor. Napoleon when 'Â»

WHIST is a more powerful
moral and social factor
than Is generally real
ized. Already women
have exercised ' a great
and good influence upon this, the
most intellectual and elegant pas
time known, and its future wel
fare must largely depend upon the
continuance of their Interest and
support.
It Is my ort-Â«xpress*d belief that
women have In an equal degree
with men all the natural qualities
which are essential to the playing
of good whist.
Mrs. A. A. Fredericks, president
of the Trtst Duplicate Whist Club,
has fully exemplified it In her
thorough knowledge of the game
and executive ability. She is con
' sldered one of the best lady whist
players on the Pacific Coast, and
is a most zealous and indefatiga
ble worker In the cause of good
whist.
The Trist Duplicate Wblst Club
* has a membership of about fifty,
mostly gentlemen. They showed
their appreciation of and confi
dence in Mrs.. Fredericks when
. they <4ectcd her to that office, and
ehe bus by her able management
shown that thrir confidence In her
ability was" not misplaced. The
Trist Duplicate Whist Club has Its
dubiooms at 711 Jones street.
Compaig whist is played Tuesday

that the upper part of it becomes the

center you will â¢ see the cavalier's

allowed and duly carried cut, though oc
casionally there' are houses where the fair
ones rebel against the custom: and, of
course,. In such cases the claim Is not
enforced. The tutty men carry staves
decorated with ribbons of many colors,
and they are usually men of influential
standing In tha town. Â¦ ' ,
One of - the most curious towns In
Europe where there Is a legal right to
kiss young ladles Is Halmagen, a provin
cial town of Roumanial It arose as fol
lows: Many centuries ago the Turks raid
ed Halmagen and the district around and
â¢carried off as captives all the young
women they could find. But many of
these women afterward escaped, owing to
a band of Roumanian brigands overtaking
the Turks and forcing them to fight So
overjoyed were the late captives on reach
ing their native town . that they kissed
everybody whom they metâ man . or
woman. And tht remembrance of this
escape has been annually kept up on the
feast of St. Theodora, whan a kind of fair
la held at Halmagen, and the town girls
offer their lip* for all neighboring people
to kiss. Â¦' - ' : â¢â¢â¢.<â¢ ... Â¦-' .
: There la one .town : " to Europe wh ere
kissing ' Is strictly ; put "down by - law.
This j SqfaÂ£l Milan. In "Italy. *" Onm r of .: the
by-laws of Milan prohibits all kisses or
amatory demonstrations In streets : and
other - public places whatever, * under
pain of a heavy penalty. The. curious
statute dates from the time of Sforta, and
Is yet rigidly enforced. , s^f** '?~**
.The; example would seem to be conta
gious, for the Sheriff acts a precisely sim
ilar part with some other chosen lady,,
who also receives a solatiumâ if such Is
neededâ In the shape of a sovereign. As
a rule, the two ladies kissed must not be
to claim the soil of the River; Tyne.
There is always a large crowd awaiting
them at ttie" landing stage, and, accord
ing to the rite of past days, the Mayor
selects any young lady he pleases from
the crowd and gives her a kiss, after
ward presenting her with a sovereign. .

day." and, following ancient custom on
that day, the Mayor and corporation
sail In a procession of four gay ly deco
rated steamers and two old state barges.
A notable case of this occurs at Maid
enhead whenever what is known as the
"beating of the bounds" takes place. This
ceremony was carried out â¢ not very
long ago, and the kissing portion of it
was duly observed. ; Mr. Alderman Cox
acted as master of the ceremonlM. and
was preceded by the sergeant-at-mace,,
and accompanied by a goodly company
of officials and spectators. Whenever la
dles were encountered on the road during
the beating of the bounds they could
choose whether they would be "bumped"
or kissed. The majority of them choose
the Utter, and the kissing was productive
of great amusement to more folks than
the two engaged in It. -Some lady cyclists
who were met with preferred the bump
ing, and got it three times on one of the
boundary stones, much , to' their discom
fiture.
IT will doubtless be news to the ma
jority of people that there are,sev
eral towns in the United Kingdom
where certain officials; have a pre
scriptive right to kiss certain ladies
during their years of office/ â¢ 'â¢ _;.'-.
Hocktide at Hungerford, which takes
place in April each year, has long gained
notoriety. It has been the Immemorial
custom for the, two chosen "tuttv men,"
or bailiffs, who collect the penny tax on
that day , from every house, to j claim a
kiss from one lady at least of each family
relatives of; the gentlemen; and, In order
to . show that there is no ill feeling or
Jealousy about the action of her spouse,
the Mayoress . presents to the lucky girl
whom he has chosen, a very handsome

*^*f CERTAIN beauty seeker once
f I went to her physician:
I I "Give me a prescription for my
V, I complexion," she said.
JL Upon a clip of paper the wise
man wrote: Get into a perspiration ev
*ry day. Exercise! Exercise! Exercise!"
No better complexion remedy could be
given than is embodied in this prescrip
tion. It is the beginning of beauty. Out
door workers, however careless, are usu
ally bleesed with .a good complexion.
Take exercise. Get Into a glow. Bo
E&aU you walk forth into the paths of
beauty and have a skin clear and admir
able. Incidentally you gather health, for
health and beauty are handmaidens.
And what gives a woman, in the first
place, a bad complexion?
Cold feet, and some women have tbÂ«m
all the year around, will do it. Chilly
knees, and you would be surprised to
know how many suffer from this simple
ill, may be responsible. Tight lacing,
often done unconsciously, will Induce a
blotchy face and a tight collar will brinÂ«
a mottled look to the surface in a short
time.
It is a great deal easier to get a poor
skin than it is to get rid of one. You can
cultivate a greenish, bilious hue in a
week's time, but It will take you two
weeks to get that color away. The face
that is Inclined to be purple from too
much color is as bad as the one that Is
Inclined to be blue from the very lack of
it. And then there is the freckled skin
and the rough one. always chapped.
In these days one does not often find
the pimple, and the boil upon your face
is rtill less frequently seen. Except
where there in a skin trouble, in. which
case the victim etays in the house; or
among very unfortunate folks who do not
know bow to treat the skin, there is no
?Â¦urn thing as the face that is a mass of
pimples. And for this one can be thank
ful, for the sight was never a pleasant
one.
The Peachblow Skin.
But the peachblow skin is by no means
the commonest thing in the world and
those who* have perfect complexions ari
rare. Though It can be claimed that this
blessing and great beauty is within' the
reach ot all.
A beauty doctor once received a call
from a wealthy patroness: "Doctor," said
she, "I will pension you if you will stop
practicing."
"Madame!" exclaimed he.
"I mean what I say," replied the pa
tient. "You are healing up all the poor
complexions and very soon I shall have
nothing to boast of. , I shall no longer be
queen, for there will be thousands of
others aa good looking as I." Â¦
Then there la tha blackhead and on this
point there are many queries.
A reader writes about her skin and
asks specially about blackheads. How
shall she get rid of them.
In all complexion ills there Is nothing
quite as easily cured as the blackhead.
There is really no need for having even
one on the face and the remedies are
simple and within the reach of Â©very one.
For the blackhead the treatment Is
cleanliness. The black spot is caused by
a settling of dust in the open pores of the
skin. Take away the dirt and keep It
away and the speck is gone. '
To go back to the beauty prescription,
begin your treatment for blackheads by
getting into a glow. Exercise. Get that
simplest of all gymnasium Implements, a,
wand, and go to work with it. Try lift
ing It very high with the arms spread
apart. Then lower it, and, putting it over
your head, see how far you can spread
out your arms upon it and how beautiful
ly it exercises your lungs and chest.
When you have brought yourself Into a
full glow, then begin the blackhead treat
ment. Wash the face with hot water,
holding on the cloth until the face feels
warm. _,
Now spread the afflicted places well
with a good cold cream, various recipes
for which have been given from time to
time.
Those Little Slack Spots.
With a soft cloth take off the cream
and wash the face again with hot water,
this time putting a little powdered borax
In the water to soften It.
Let the washing operation take an hour,
for the cold cream should be .left on at
least half that time.
Be sure to remain indoors after the
treatment and do not go near an open
window, for the skin of the face is pre-.
cisely like the skin of the hands and will
chap Just as easily. . â¢
You are not in the habit of exposing
the hands to the air directly after wash
ing them. Nor must you expose, the face.
. Last of all. if you have been vigorous
with the towel you may anoint the face
ever so slightly with cold cream and let
It remain on. Cucumber cream is best for,
thls.'ae it does not leave a shine. There
are many brands of it and every druggist
handles a good one. , .
Your blackheads will now be all gone
unless they were pronounced, in which
case they will yield at the next treatment
For the face that Is inclined ; to break
out there must be an entirely different set
of remedies, for the course that is good
for one will injure another. The soft,
delicate, rashy skin must not be scrubbed
nor must it be irritated in any way. Its
treatment must be all of a soothing na
ture. , ; Â¦'Â¦.Â¦,'Â¦, Â¦ ,- " :
Begin, then, by anointing such a skin
every night with a cream whose basis la
the - old-fashioned mutton tallow. * Noth
ing has ever equaled this aa a skin food.
Let your cream be soft and scented with
rose or lavender. , Do not use camphor
In It, for you do not want an irritant
but a soother.' r
Such a Â»kin should ba perfectly clear.

A course of diet is necessary with ex

let her stand .upon one foot and balance

daring, such as Â»flying from an ottoman,
wand in- hand, and leaping Into the air,

The virtue, of course, of a curling fluid
is that the hair remains In curl for sev

Another secret of preserving the wavi

hair must be as tightly twisted as a 'cord
before it is wrapped around the corlacs
or papilottes. This gives the curls sta

The woman who has been accustomed
to curl her hair by moistening it with a
lather of soap and waterâ a very easy
way of curling the hair, by the way
must be told that there is tradition that
soap used in any quantity on tha hair
turns It gray. Used with alcohol soap la
quite harmless. One of the numerous
hair curling fluids calls for a quarter of a
pound of castile soap, cut in small pieces;
pour, over this half a pint of alcohol; per
fume with a Quarter of a dram each of
essence of ambergris, citron and neroll.

Beware of '"the process which-perma

there are no women "up there." Mr.
Kinsman bolsters his theory with the
strongest Biblical evidence.
Strange as it may Veem, it will be read
ily admitte-i that there is not the slight
est evidence in the Bible that fema'.CB of
any sort are among the Inhabitants of
heaven. We know that the members of
the Trinity are always epoken of as men
and the disciples of Jesus were all men.
Tn both the Old and the New Testaments,
>rhen occasion offered to speak of one
who had passed to the other elde. It was
always a man who had been so fortunate.
And, likewise, when a prophet, saint or
disciple had pecagion to mention any one
who 1 had reached heaven the name cf a
man was chosen.
Ho. too, we find it in the case of angels.
There are Gabriel and Michael, but in all
the named heavenly host there appears
not one feminine name.
In this connection it is interesting to
note that in each case where a pronoun is
used In reference to an angel masculine
forms are invariably found.
ARE THERE ANY WOMEN IN HEAVEN?
There is, apparently, nothing left which
is at all tenable, save the third conten
tion, viz.", that women, upon reaching
heaven, become males. To' prove which
Mr. Kinsman quotes Jchuh' reply to the
Sadducees, when they ask of the disposi
tion on resurrection morn of the woman
who had seven husbands:
"Ye. do err, not knowing the scriptures
nor the power of God. For in the resur
rection they neither marry nor. are given
In marriage, but are as the angels of
God in heaven." '. ."â¢'â¢'
For those who find pleasure In mental
speculation of this sort,, this Is the most
plausible theory, as well us the least, re
pellant one. It is a theory which merges
the mysteries of love and life into' those
of death and. the resurrection. Most peo
ple, sometimes even' the most practical,
like to cherish that pretty Bentiment that
there â¢ is a certain, ' particular wo'rnan j for
a certain, particular man. '..Â¦Â¦
" In other words,' we all recognize 1 n a
greater or. less degree, the theory, of hu
man afljnlty,' the classic Wth of the wan
dering soul seeking its* mate, its comple
ment. I believe that a good, woman goes
to heaven : just as '; a ':, main '_ doesâ that : is,'
as a perfected wholeâ the complete "ego."
. Huxley and other scientists have proved
conclusively that the human ; has not al-
ways been differentiated ! by , sexâ that
there were not always male and female.

V â ~\ RENCH statisticians have â¢ 'dlscov
jr 5 * ered that during last wrnter v SOOiOOO
Â¦ 1> tons of snails were consumed In
Paris. This indicates a renaissance
.for the snail, for. although It ha* always
'been especially esteemed by the French
people, it has fallen Into disfavor for a
season or two past, owing to the fact that
the culture of the snail has been taken up
largely by speculators, who have aimed
at' quantity rather 'than quality in their
productions.. Â¦' '
Many of the snails sold in Paris reallv
come from Burgundy and the Savoy dis
tricts, ? but are represented* as from the
vineyards , of Dijon and . Macon. One of
â¢ the methods of the speculating snail
growers is to raise them in pens of tarred
boards that prevent the mollusks Â¦ from
traveling far. . Â¦ ' ." " !
Much depends .on the, proper culture of
the snail. In ancient Rome the raisers
fed them on flour' and' wine, thus giving
them fatness and flavor. .'
' Americans *as ' a class do not share the
enthusiasm of the' French as regards the
V Briall.' .The core that Is necessary for their
â¢ proper preparation Â¦ debars them from the
-field, of -the average cook 1 absolutely and
great chefs fall sometimes if .they have
not the proper, French blood In theff veins.
Even at thefashlonuble restaurants It Is
.often, impossible to obtain snails..' When
/they, are served they are tough and leath-'
, ery, and people wonder why they have
ever been Included In the lists of good
things.
At the French restaurants, the be^t of

"We serve quantities ot snails each

ing upon it Mrs. Hensley said: .
"From what I can gather of Mr. Kins
man's ideas, I fancy he has soared to
some weird Buddhistic heights and re
> turned to earth a little mixed. His theory
would seem to .be a curious jumble of
Christian theology and theosophical evo
lution. For, of course, the whole ques
tion depends. on the assumption that the
body accompanies the soul to Its future
state. Otherwise, if the thing that ex
ists and persists finally be simply the
ego. the individuality, apart frdm the per
sonality that is manifested through our
' physical frame, whence this talk of man
and woman, of male and female?
"If in a future state It is the Self that
continues to live, that Self. Itself immor
tal and therefore a part of Deity, is and
can be neither male nor female. Mr.
Kinsman, while holding in his mind cer
tain progressive ideas of reincarnation
and karmic experience, and assuming that

"Science. is muicinjj rapid strides \ In

"If you take a tuning fork and while
it Is still vibrating touch the head with
it you can .hear It. The sound Is trans
mitted to the auditory nerve by the
means of bone vibration. If you listen
to It In the natural way you will per
ceive that the sound is much louder. The
sound'- transmitted through bone vibra
tion is much more indistinct, owing: to
the' difference In the medium through
which the,, sound vibrations must pas?
"A friend of mine who was Â«o deaf
that I fairly had to shout to him could
hear me talk through the telephone In my
natural voice, so I used to send him In
an adjoining efflce and ring him up when
I had anything to tell him. He would put
th<Â» receiver close to hfs ear and the
Eound waves would go direct, carried by
the bone vibration.
"In cases of deafness when the audi
tory nerve Is not affected the vibrations
can be transmitted through the bone to
the auditory nerve anu telegraphed to the
brain, i If* the sound vibration can reach
the auditory nerve the rest of the process
is the same as it la with those whose
hearing Is unimpaired. ; ," :
- "Sound comes to the person with unim
paired hearing- through sound waves,
which strike upon the ear drum and set
in motion a fluid, and the vibration passes
through these three tiny bones before it la
considered by mother nature subdued
enough, to touch the sensitive
nerve, which in turn transmits 1 the im

"The car is a very delicate member. It

course to the inner ear, where, within an
Inch of space we find the three smallest
bones of the - body and a rolled up key
board on which is played the great
gamut of all audible sounds which the
mind registers..
"It is through bone vibration that the
man hears. This method of hearing is often
employed when the auditory nerve- is un

ranged higher: perhaps if Venus had hnd
earrings; perhaps if Helen of Troy could
have placed a butterlly of emeralds in
her hair, all would have been different
They might haye marred the sceno; thej
might have made it. One beauty can wea
these things and another cannot. The
existing pictures of these ladies show
them as beauty unadorned.
At the Coronation all must be cant in
one mold, as far as dress is concerned,
and the bitterness comes in the thought
that some cannot bear the test.
These points will characterize the Kns
lish beauty: .
Perhaps if Juno's hair had been ar-
no question of precedence, while the robes
would be vastly more becoming than those
that were assigned to the "ladles."
Another woman who has fought for
richer gowns is Lady Londonderry, who
wishes to' dress in crimson. Her Lady
ship is blest with a neck and is the owner
of a graduated circle of diamonds that
just meets around it. Below this she wears
a double string of the biggest pearls in
England, or the oldest ones, a slight tint
revealing their years. Her earrings are
exactly the size of hdzelriuts.
At the Coronation these beauties must
bow to the decree of the Court Chamber-*
lain and wear the gowns that come' to
them by rank. But at the royal ball,
which follows the Corcmation by a few
days, then all will dress as best becomes
them and the beauty rivalry will wax
fierce.
It Is a day when petty points become
great ones. When a woman Is struggling
to maintain her beauty supremacy every
thing counts. The arrangement of the
hair, the style of crown, the angle at
which it shall be worn, the jewels that
can be placed in juxtaposition to the face
âall of these become of vital import.
Â£-TÂ«vHE Coronation will be a Beauty
I " Show.
j Standing, side by side, there will
I be the American beauties, each
dressed in her appropriate gown
and wearing her prettiest smile.
And opposite the American beauties,
looking at them with envious eyes, will
be the English women.
And the two will be intermixed and in
termingled. The American women have
married into English families; and the
Countess of Essex, America's pride, will
stand Bide by side with the Countess of
Anglesey, the pride of England.
Which will be the handsomer? And will
you be able to pick one nationality out
from the other, looking over the whole?
The prettiest woman of King Edward's
court is the Countess of Warwick. Her
fame as "The Babbling Brook" went
abroad. long since. In her late thirties,
sne has lost none of her loveliness. But
to the old attractiveness there has been
added a mature richness, an aplomb; one
might say. an assurance. Lord Rosebery
Mtid of her last year: "She makes you
forget that there is a blue sky outside of
her wide blue eyes."
America is fond of thinking that its
women axe the prettiest in the world. And
perhaps they are. But there are certainly
others.
There are those who think the Eng
lish standard of a higher type than the
American.
The English woman is classic, conven
tional, pure in feature, faultless in out
line, clear in color, tall, and even massive.
The svelte, chic American, with her wit
and her tact, catches the eye. But the
- English we man holds it longer.
Which will be the lovelier? The rival
beauties, ranged in rows at the Corona
tion will stand there for the world to e-.'c
&nd judge.
Who will be the Paris that awards the
prize of beauty to either?
The Countess of Westmoreland, holder
of an old title, is among the handosmest
of women. And the Countess de Grey is
Â»o famous that her face is almost an
English landmark. She has been used in
beauty books, in public prints, upon trade
marks, in "typeg" and as an art head.
She i* often pictured in costume as Cleo
patra, for she is supposed to bear a â¢strong
resemblance to the ancient Queen. '
It was Lady Helen Vincent, the woman
whom the Queen considers the truest type
of English beauty, who urged that the*
robes of the ladles b*; equal in grandeur
to those of the duchesses. Being so widely
different In rank, and occupying a position

THE LADY OF HER VALETCT\ HE annual distribution of Comanche
I Indian brides recently occurred at
I the . Saddle Mountain .Mission, in
I Southern Oklahoma.' Fifty ' of . the
' X < prettiest -women of the tribe were
â¢â¢.-.-, Â¦> sold at public auction as the wives
of tribesmen who bid them in. This bar
baric custom' was to have been discon
tinued by the Comanches last year, but it
went on more boldly than ever this sea
son, being: conducted under the very eyes
of the white settlers. ' â¢ --
v The festival â¢ of : the Comanche S "pony
smoke," as this. ceremony Is called. Is of
more than passing interest. Seldom are
so many young squaws auctioned oft as
was : done this year, but the surplus was
exeat and needed thinning out, according
to the head men of the tribe. Their par
ents, refusing to keep them any long
er, the .girls .naturally needed
homes somewhere, and It was
deemed best by the medicine
men to auction them off as
wives, . the highest bid
ders to take their
choice. Big Bow, a
monstrous*" f at and
ugly . redskin,
acted as the
auctioneer.
He was
assisted by a number of medicine
men, who performed the marriage cere
monies after the sales had been made. Â¦Â¦
-'Five hundred Indians gathered at the
Saddle Mountain Mission last week. This
mission Is located thirty miles directly
south of Mountain View, and on the range
â¢of the Wichita Mountains. The girls who
were sold, had been 'confined In a lodge
for three weeks prior to this meeting/ and
were well fed and extremely well groomed.
They. were all clad in gay Colors/ and their
hair arranged in perfect Indian fashion.
It was plain to see that their parents had
prepared them to bring fancy prices. The
girls were In various Â¦, moods: some hys
terical, others calm, and not a few de
lighted with the experience.
| Among others j was a' daughter of the
famous Quahnah ' Parker, the rioted Co-.
manche Indian chief.' This daughter,
whose name is Amy. had displeased him
by attempting to run away and marry a
white man; and a cowboy at that, so Par
ker decided that the best thing would be
to sell her "at auction. This is the first
time Parker, who is counted by his white
neighbors a highly 'cultivated red man*
has ever allowed i any of his relatives to
be sacrificed . at the auction block. But
the wrath of an Indian parent knows no
bounds*:' Â¦ Â¦-' ' . .
Sad and silent, Amy Parker was led to
the block for sale. The . first bid was
eleven ponies. -Jack Wild Horse, a well
known scout of the tribe, was the bidder.
He was immediately raised by a: rival.

bid fifteen. Others then cut Jn, and
Miss 'Parker was run up to fifty
ponies. Her face grew pale when
Â»he" saw that Wild Horse was
determined to get her, as
he is known as the
most- desperate

when drunk or ; angered. 'Â¦ * It Â» la '
said that he has killed three" wives when
drunk. "Wild. Horse, however. -./, won " tbm'
young squaw for sixty-three ponies. The
stock was turned over to Parker, and a]
medicine man married Wild Horse and
the squaw according , to the i Comanche
rites. The couple: then went to El lUno,
where a regular, marriage' license was is
sued to them and the ceremony repeated
by a pale-face minister. Although the
marriage took place only three days ago.
a dispatch from Lawton .'says' that she
attempted to commit suicide after f all- i
Ing In an attempt to kill her new husband. "'
Other young women objected quite as ,
strongly as Miss Parker did to being auc
tioned off, but It did them no good what-'
ever. Big Bow went ahead with the sale 1
until every one of them was' sold.,: Thai
lowest bid made for - any i of them .was I
twenty poniÂ«3. This was the price paid,
for a half-breed woman who had been ~i
married to a white man, but the latter .1
having died, she reverted back to nerj
parents again. ,

the three days of the big bridal auction- _

answer the letter as directed and see
what would "evolve. He ' was' to write to'

He wrote and was Informed that the
trunk ' containing the entire plan for re
covering the buried treasure had been

of the one issued at the time of his mas*
tor's commitment for eight years of penal
servitude. The master, however, having
died before the settlement and costs of
court as set forth in the decree were ar
ranged for. The honest man Friday con
sults with the alleged relative In the let
ter which he sends with the decree. The
decree itself is a marvel of seeming uu< j
thenticity written on legal paper, with nil
the Insignia and red tape customary, in
.technical- matters.
Here the crucial moment arrives when
the faithful man Friday, though sworn by
Christ and him crucified to do his duty,
launches forth his scheme boldly to sep
arate the relative from his â¢ clinking slmo
leons. Here Is a copy of this veraclous
llke document:
"The clerk of the special civil tribunal
certifies that the third civil tribunal: has
decreed as follows: That in the case of
Louis Dominguez Raymond the testimony
before the court 'showed said Louis Do
minguez Raymond to be a native of the
Canary Islands, 42 years of age and j a*
widower. , and that- he committed the
crime of fraudulent bankruptcy, he at the
time being a banker in Santa Cruz da
Teneriftc. He became bankrupt for two'
million pesetas. Considering that under
the : provision of article 47 of the
constitution, this tribunal has Jurisdic
tion, and considering that under' the law
as applied . under provisions of articles
411 and 412 of the penal code, It Is hereby
ordered and decreed that j Louis \ Domin
guez Raymond be condemned to eight
years' penal servitude, and -that he also
pay the 1 sum of ' 10,350 pesetas and . the
costs of this proceeding, -which amounts
.to 437.55 pesetas. â¢ / , .,/â¢.' '."
-, "It is also' ordered that if In the period
of Ax months' from date said Louis Do
minguez Lopez does not pay the said sum
that all, his; goods; and property now In '
possession of the Government- be sold at
public auction ; and ' the proceeds ' applied ,
to the satisfaction of 'said fine., ; t . :

This sounds good to the American Lo- '
pez and he cablegrams as per directions,
and the hearts of the bunko steerers in
Old Madrid are made glad accordingly.
The gullible American next gets a letter
from Gonzalez, who parades* as the man
Friday, the sen-ant of the now deceased
prisoner. He writes:
"MADRID, Spain.
"Much Respected Sir:
"It is with the greatest sorrow that I
must inform you that my Â¦employer and
your relative. >Mr. j Louis Dominguez Lo
Â«pez, died yesterday at 4 p. m. I 'am sorry
that this, my first letter to you, should
be the messenger of such a terrible mis
fortune.
"Your relative before dying executed a
will and testament In which you are
named as the guardian of his daughter
and heir to his estate to the extent of 23
per cent, having left the balance to his
aforesaid daughter. He honored me by
appointing me the executor in his will,
giving me the* necessary .orders that his
last wishes might be carried out falth
Â¦ fully, and which I swore before Jesus
Christ, crucified, to carry out to the- best
of my ability.
"It will require a few days in order to
prove the will In court, as' well as to es
tablish our respective rights, so I will
wait until this Is over before I send you
the will and Instructions necessary' to take
charge of the estate, which Is in Havana.
"Receive the best \ assurances of your
faithful and humble servant,
"AMBROSIA GONZALEZ." â¢
The American mourns 'the loss of his
deceased relative, but his nearly incon
solable sorrow is', lessened somewhat by
the fact that he gets 25 per cent, of the
estate. V
As evidence of good faith, the man Frl-;
day sends in a few days 'a prison certifi
cate stating that Louis Dominguez Lopez
was held as prisoner in Madrid and that
he died in Jail. This certificate is signed
by the prison director and the administra
tor of the prison. A copy of the will is
also sent on Government paper numbered
and stamped and certified to by
THOMAS DEL VALLE,
Notary Public,
Madrid, Spain.
(Seal and rubric attached.)
The copy of the will is sent to show that i
all is as represented. The pseudo relative
' here is appointed guardian of the girl and
her inheritance, and the man Friday is,
shown to be the lawful executor of the
estate. , '.Â¦Â¦.'''
The wide-eyed American congratulates
himself on the good luck that ..has be
fallen him. Any lurking j suspicion as to
the validity of the documents 'and the au
thenticity of his late benevolent relative
is dissipated by the Government seals on
the official papers. . ....'./. : ''"
He next receives a copy of the decree
which is calculated to net the die already,
cast. The decree and a long -letter in
closed Is sent by the faithful man Friday
to the now only remaining one. of the kith
and kin of his lost master. V -
The decree purports to be a fac simile' ..
Schemes to Catch
Americans by a "Pea
and Shell" Most Game
Lucrative and Romantic
THE bunko artist la something new
to consider. The American of that
Ilk Is unpretentious, abrupt, shifty:
his campaign is planned along lim
ited lines and his intended victims
are many. 'A sucker is born every
minute, is his slogan, and following this
philosophy he drops an unpromising vic
tlra and betakes himself to new* fields,
his ardor undampened. his glad hand ex
tended ready to go over his programme
again, pinning his faith only to his per
socal exuberance and the traditional gul
llbffitr of mankind.
In other lands, where time Is not at
sceh & premium, the rypÂ© is essentially
different, and from Spain halls a bunko
story that reads like a romance. The vic
tims are usually picked from those in
whose veins flows the blood of the
hatjrhty Don, bat the game has been per
petrated oa some Americans as well.
Sener GolOeracena, the Bpanlsh Consul
at this port. Is daily besieged by persons
who at different stages of nibbling at the
tempting looking bait come to him 'with
the weighty and legal looking documents -
la the dulcet language of Castile for
translation. Borne come In the first stages
of Inquiry and some are well nigh landed
and have their money all ready to send.
"It '!â¢ a'peheme that should be exposed
'for the good of the commonwealth," de
clares Mr. Golderacena, " for In the last
two weeks no less than twenty-five peo
ple have come to tell me how they have
been caught In the net. In all cases the
schemes are Identical; the letters are du
plicates, differing only In the name which
is Inserted to fit each particular case."
They evidently ha\'e an old San Fran
cisco directory over in Madrid from which
they get the names, for most of the peo
ple have moved from the address on- the
letter some six or seven years ago. The
first letter reads:
"My Very Dear Mr. Lopez: â¢
â¢ "Alter years of Investigation, I hope I
have found a clew to your whereabouts,
for I feel sure you are the relative for
whom I have searched so long. 'I am con
fined in prison in Madrid, being con
demned for eight years. In former days
I -was a banker in the Canary Islands,
but business having gone wrong,. I .gath
ered all the funds I could get together
and took a trip through America, where
I deposited them In a bank. I took an
extended trip, but when I got back to.
Spain I was arrested and finally sentenced
to' eight years of penal servitude. I am
compelled to leave to you the charge of
my >oung daughter; also of my fortune of
75.000 pounds sterling, v/hich is deposited
in a bank in America, and I offer you 25
per cent for your trouble.
"If you will do me this great favor, ad
dress a cablegram to me as follows:
"MR. AMBROSIA GONZALEZ.

"I will on receipt of this cablegram send
you all Instructions. Do not write, as I
would not get the letter anyhow. I t wiil
explain everything in my next.

Experience has taught one thing: he de
generates when brought under the Influ
ence of Western civilization, losing some
of his primitive virtues, and falling to
acquire others that require the exercise of
reason and discipline. In his analysis of
the Malay character, Mr. Colquhoun says:
"Other deficiencies, in their, mental and
moral equipment, are a" lack â¢ of organiz
ing power. No Malay nation ha* ever
emerged from the hordes of that race
which have spread over the islands of the
Pacific. Wherever they are found they
have 'certain marked characteristics, juni
of these the most remarkable is their
lack of that spirit which goes to I form a
homogeneous people. . to weld them to
t-ether.>ThÂ« Malay is always a provin
cial; more, he rarely rises outside the in-
confederation, on the footing of Bavaria,
not willingly perhaps, but under the pres
sure of international complications In
which a small and weak nation cannot re
tain Its Independence of action and sur
vive without loss. The possible compli
cations to South Africa, once Holland has
become a partner to the great German
empire, come not within the scope I of
present considerations. The prophecy* that
England will ultimately lose the Cape,
whatever the outcome of the present war,
assumes new significance In this light
Mr. Colquhoun doubts vtry strongly the
success of the education we are going to
give to the Filipinos, and bases his doubt
upon the characteristics and possibilities
of the Malays, as revealed hitherto In
their relations with Europeans.
The Malay has undoubted charm. He
is bright, hospitable, has a certain ten
derness of heart, and possesses in general
the fundamental traits that make the
gentleman, the world over. , He Is easy
to rule, so long as he recognises his mas
ter, is brave, but superstitious. ~; He also
has. to fullest measure, the defects of his
qualities. ' Â¦
Mr. Colquhoun relegates Germany to an
altogether secondary role In his book,
placing to ber stead Holland, on account
of what one of ber literary men, who de-.
sired the late King William III to assume
the title of Emperor, called the Jaland In
dia, "Insullnde." But, however puzzling
the policy of the German Emperor to Chi
na, there can be no doubt that If a trans
ference of the Dutch East Indies Is to be
made to the future, they will go to Ger
many, not by conquest but by the acces
sion of the Netherlands to the German
It Is a curious feature of the New
World politics that, at the beginning of
the new century, the young powers of
the world have demonstrated their as
cendency by their action In the East.
The author points out that of the coun
tries concerned, Australia Is the young
est. Russia the oldestâ as a world power
she is but some two centuries' old. Eng
land, the old Titan past his prime,
feeling the beginning of a decline after
a century of supremacy, no longer leads
to the Orient The alliance with Japan
Is already regarded with doubt by many
of her serious thinkers, and other clos*
allies she "has none. Russia, the United
States, Japan, Australia, Canada, to
some degree at least, but aq yet mostly
to the future, and, finally. Germanyâ an
empire thirty years oldâ are the . chief
actors In what Is perhaps the most be
wildering and difficult problem of world
politics ever offered to the world for so
lution.
The usefulness of the Chinaman
throughout all the Far East is' referred
to time and again. In Australia the, prob
lem is two-foldâ how to keep theiChina^
man out. and what to do without .him.
He Is sorely needed In ' certain I regions
where the white man cannot work and
live, but the Australian Labor party
is very strong, and cannot allow of dis
criminations of, this kind. It is a racial
question, rather than one of cheap com.
petition, for, says Mr. Colquhoun, "It
must not be supposed that John, at this
stage of his career, will act as an emer
gency manâ he has realized his own
value too well. It is to the choicest spot*
where the precious metal is to be found
and profitable work done, that he turns*
his face now. Impoverished Borneo
starves for him. opens her arms to him.
but he will not go to her.' â¢ â¢ â¢ The
situation is already acute in Australia."
Mr. Colquhoun opens his book on "The
Mastery of the Pacific" with a histor>
of the Pacific, from the coming of the
first bold navigator to the- purchase of
the Philippines by. this country, and then
proceeds to discuss the position in the
Pacific of the United States, Great Brit
ain and her colonies. Holland and Japan,
devoting but a single chapter to Ger
many. France. Russia and China. He
considers naval power as the ultimate
solution of the problem. Japan has, of
course, the great advantage of being the
only naval power on the spot, but in Mr.
Colquhoun's opinion the United States
will be the dominant factor in the mas
tery, of the Pacific. China he. treats
throughout as a negligible quantity, a
giant who will passively await what
ever the other powers Inay decide to do,
after they have settled the question
among themselves, either by diplomacy,
or a resort to arms. Yet, In the very
last sentence of his book, he recognizes
the fact that the "utilization of the
huge force lying dormant In China is
one of the 'great problems of the fu
ture, and upon its solution depends to a
great extent the future of the Pacific." '

-7- The Filipino Isnot a pure, Malay; he Is
so heterogeneous 'as to defy clussl.ication.
Colquhoun says that ihe principal ele
ments in the mixture are Spanish and;
Chinesf . The Chinese half-breeds are the
most brainy and puzzling members of the
population and form a large proportion of
the Insurgents. "The Chinese' character
ts so involved." says Mr. Colquhoun, "and
so irhpcstfible to generalize, that â¢â¢ is dif
ficult to suggest the possible modifications
It Would .make In. the Malay; but when
we remember the strong conservatism of
the Chinese and their, intense supersti
tion, we cannot be surprised at the promi
nence of these two qualities in their Fill-'
plno descendants. Some of the traditions
current in the Philippines, for instance
the idea that mines could not be opened
without the applications to the 'veins' of
an unguent composed of old women's
eyes, and a. report, as late as 1S30, that
children weie to be seized, that their blood
might wash. the gold and. silver mines of
Spainâ these arc characteristically Chi
nese." â¢ '.-Â¦Â¦Â¦. "-.Â¦'.'.â¢Â¦â¢ ''Â¦'.'Â¦": Â«"'Â¦'
Mr. Colruhoun believes that we are in
too much of a hurry to bestow upon the,
Filipinos the. benefits and blessings ; of
our: civilization.* He holds â that, it will
take more than two generations to create'
the new Filipino and obscrveR very per- "
tinently that we must not forget, that

The author points out, that the Span
lards Tiave made a double Impression'
upon the Filipino, by intermarriage and
government From them the. Filipino has
a certain grandiloquence, words without
thought, but strangely deceptive as an In
dication' of mental faculties. The "Intel;
Iectual subtlety of the Latin has also been
curiously grafted on \ the simplicityâ
which is not stupidityâ of the Malay. .The
result is a peculiar leaning toward ab
stract ideas, a love of the purely .theo
retical side of learning, with a corre
sponding inability to apply 1 those theories
which are to bring things apart from real
lifeâ things they have learned or "read,

begin with the abstract, and fall to work

part of the story, but there is plenty of
trouble long before this on account of the
old gentleman's efforts to marry off the
SrtOfid Dorothy against her will. The first
family row cf this kind occurs upon the
return of the cousin. Sir Malcolm Yeraon.
'â¢knight by the hand of Queen Mary of
Scotland- and of France." Old Sir George
'decides That the plan of years ago shall
be consummated and that his estates and
his daughter's hand shall go to one of the
name of Vernon. Neither Malcolm nor
Dorothy, however, are ready to ac
quiesce.
Malcolm has seen at the first glance
thai .Dorothy's disposition is too much of
fire and tow to suit hJTp, end Dorothy has
already had her eye upon the handsome
Sii John Manners, whom chance has
brought as a fellow traveler with Mal
colm to the Inn where Dorothy happens
Jo be stopping at the time of the young
men's arrival.
Malcolm does not share In Sir George's
haired for the family of Rutland, so when
the outbreak occurs over his refusal of
the fair Dorothy's hand he even goes for
a time to seek safety In the castle of his
family's enemy. Malcolm at this time Is
a fugitive in fear of his life for having
aided Mary Etuart.
Mr. Major has endeavored to ' give us
something original to the way of differen
tiation of character. Dorothy Is supposed
to be a type of maid both. modest and
virtuous who falls in love and then give*
herself up entirely to her passion without
rhyme or reason. The author tries the
difficult trick of sustaining his heroine In
both her contrary roles at one and the
came timeâ no easy task. In justice to
Mr. Major it must be said that in this
particular point he succeeds, and at least
tnakes the picture consistent.
Big names do not make big stories. All
the Mary Queen of Scots, and Eliza
beth Queen of Englands, and the Earl
cX Ldcesters to the worldâ all of them
rolled together Into one big colossal fig
to*âreally add but very little after all
to a story where you read for the story's
.â¢ake. Sir Walter Scott has done so much
better with all of these characters that I
should think plain Mr. Major would be
ashamed to look his set c| Waverly nov
els to the face.
As* It Is, "Dorothy VÂ«rnen M savors
strongly of the *'pot-boller"â * few well
known persons of history to give verity
to Its pages, some conceits of character
to Impart flavor, a dash of dramatic In
cident* rather BtaU In conception for
bodyâ all well stirred up and skillfully
cooked. Euch a mixture fortified by a bit
cf past reputation and much megaphone
Â¦lnginy; cf Its praises by the publishers,
will make It sell well, but It will be found
after all only sawdust to the reader's
stomach, whose palate may have been
hypnotized by the honeyed advertise
iststa. ' -
THERE is this to be said for Charles
Major's latest novel "Dorothy Ver-^
non of Haddon Hall": the Urastra-^
tions are quite attractive. They are
by Howard Chandler Christy, and
the work has been well done. As evidence
of their excellence we have reproduced
some of them on this page, where you
can see them and judge for yourself. If
Mr. Major could have done as much for
his heroine in his book as Mr. Christy
has donÂ« for her with his clever brush
"Dorothy Vernon" would Indeed be a
work to live among the better fiction of
thÂ« age.
dently knows whereof he writes. By rea
son Â« of his experience during parts of the
past two years In this country, his Identi
fication with it and | his co-operation , with
i the ' persons i who have ! brought about the
final overthrow of Â¦ a great conspiracy, he
Is well qualified to elucidate the subject of

The Aliens.
"The Aliens," ' from the , pen of Mary
Tappan Wright, is rather disappointing,
in the light -of the" previous r. excellent
work done by Mrs. Wright. Her story ts
supposed, to bring out the life the
South :â¢ of '' to-day; but :,to those , of - : her
readers who are at all familiar with the
.Southern - life," even ' through hearsay; It
must be evident that the author has al
lowed her fancy to -strayâ and in a man
ner: that will be found most unpleasant

â¢ "The Aliens" tells of the life of a yoijng
.Northern -woman who comes to live in
the South as the wife of a college pro
fessor,' also a ' Northerner,- who has ac
cepted a chair in a Southern university.
The motif of the book is supposed to
bring out the radical differences encoun
tered by an alien In the land of the cot-
i ton ' and the negroâ all of which is done
in a manner most unflattering to - the
Southern people. ,. - Fortunately the . book
is not " Interesting enough to have the

the man they were looking for crawled
out from under: the second house from

I*, is not always counterfeiting that the
secret service men are called upon to fer
ret out. The case of the cunning negroes
who loo+ed a Government bonded ware
house In the East is one that gave them
some extrt-work. One of the largest
liquor house : In the country, had in this
warehouse a consignment of imported
liquor that retailed for $12 per gallon.
They would take it out as they used it.
One day on removing a barrel of whisky,
it was found to contain perhaps as much
as would furnish drinks for two. All sorts
of wondering investigations were made by
the. liquor men. and then a second barrel
was found In the some condition. After
the customs officers had Investigated with
no results, the matter was turned, over to
the secret service men. ? Â¦ . 'Â¦Â¦.-. " .
After looking into it for a while thty
concluded the workman in the warehouse
knew something of it. and they apparently
gave up trying to fathom the mystery for
a time. Then they, dropped In - one day
upon the workmen up stairs at the lunch.
hour/Three of the negroes were missing,
and they were found down stairs and the
mystery of the empty casks was explain
ed. At lunch time these negroes bad been
in the habit of going down and tapping
these casks .with the tin arrangement
known to liquor dealers and inspectors as
Ithe "thief." and filling ten or twelve.quart
-bottles with> the liquor. They would put
them out under a covered window in a re
mote spot, and then carry them off at
night In another part of the city, they
had opened a saloon among- their country
men, and were riving this fine .whiskey to

I Secret Service is something like run-
Jnlner the job of a. city editor, only on
Â« much larger scale."
So pays John E. \TClkie. chief of
f the United States Secret Service
bureau, who In the past five years has
<^one much clever work In that capacity.
He looks the keen man of brains and af
fair* that he Is. He has been in San Fran-
Hsco looking at the finish of his aids*
Food work in the case of Walter IC. Dlm
ralck. Mr. Wilkie, has had good training
for directing men in finding out wrong
doing, for he was a newspaper man of
twenty years' experience when he left a
Chicago Journal and entered the service
cf thÂ« Government.
Since then he ha* visited many eitieÂ«.
to bear and sometimes to give testimony
la xnasy celebrated oases. Lately he per
formed a distinguished duty in acting as
bodyguard to Prince Henry of Prussia.
Many stories have been floating around
the country In regard to German de
tective* having bÂ«Â«n sent over to this
country to travel with the Prince to pre
vent him becoming the victim of an an
&xeblst
The fact of the matter is. that after
some correspondence between the Ger
man and American governments, it was
decided to leave the responsibility for th?
Prince's personal safety In the hand? of
the secret service of the United States.
That secret "servica men swarmed every
where about the Prince's party was not
true, for Prince Henry's person while he
was in this country was guarded by Just
four secret service men. These four men.
who were at all times the nearest to him.
T>-Â«>re under the constant sunervislon of
Chief Wilkie, who went along for that
vÂ«ry purpose. It Is true that detectives.
e* was eaid, were often everywhere, for
in *ach place visited the precautions of
the local police were elaborate.
Of all his party the Prince was per
haps the most democratic and the nearest
to an American in hie bearing and all
that he said. He has a keen sense of
humor, which shone forth frequently in
epite of the restraints of his position.
At a banquet in Boston Mr. W'llkle sat
net far from the Prince. There was a
prosy orator, who orated on and on un-
Ml all the guests thought that like Tenny
son's famous "Brook." he would go on
frrevcr. Just as he started afresh at the
point where every one had imagined he
would rone to a final stop, the Prince
caught Wilkie's eye and made a quiet ges
ture e: though to .reach under the breast
cf his ecat. His Royal Highness knew
that Bsder his correct evening coat Wll
kie carried a formidable revolver, slung
from bis shoulder In a holster.
Transiated into plain English, his little
pantomime to the chief of the secret ser
vice meant: "For the Lords sake, WU
kie. gÂ«Â»t out that gun and shoot him."
Without doubt the two greatest annoy
ances to the Prince during his tour were
1'hotOfcTafhy and oratory.
Mr. Wilkie describes his Royal High
ness as a most affable Prince, and says
be was worthy of all the attention he rc
ceix'eo for himself alone, because "he was
each a good fellow." Mr. Wllkie has but
few anecdotes to tell of the Prince, In bis
modesty preferring to let some others
naval men. for Instanceâ have a chance
Â«t their reminiscences first.
The secret service chief went on to nay
why bis business resembled that of a city
editor. Both he and the city editor of a.
bit daily send out their men with instruc
jooom to "get the story or die," but the
|EÂ»n of the secret service must usÂ« meth
\ia that are the reverse of open to secure
their etory, and It must be a story that
wlU stick before a Jury- So. if such a
thing were possible, the secret service
man ha* the harder task of the two.
The specific function of the Secret Ser
vice Bureau is the protection of the cur
rency of the United Statesâ to suppress
counterfeiting primarilyâ but the depart
ment is often called upon to work on
other caces. such as thefts from quarter
masters' Btcrea. robberies In the Nary
Department, mysterious disappearances of
bullion or cash from United States mints
etc \
The count/y is divided into thirty dis
tricts, each district under the superin
tendence of a regular "operative" in
charge. Each operative has a number of
assistants, some of whom are often sent
f> help In other districts, as the exigen
cies of the work demands. Each assist
ant Is required to make a dally report to
his operative, who also in his turn sends a
dally report to Mr. Wllkie at Washington
headquarters. So the chief is kept well in-

grow expert as character artists In the
facility with which they assume the char
acteristics of different classes . of men
from bank clerks to Â¦ farmers. . For in
stance, may be cited the capture ef a
countryman in Illinois who was amusirs
himself in his lonely house in an out of -
the way county by making counterfeit
five-dollar notes. The location was such,
combined with other circumstances, that
there was no 'chance for the secret serv
ice men to watch the man on whom their
suspicions rested. It was necessary to go
to the bouse and locate the man. For
two of them to have gone would have
created suspicion against them in his
mind, so one of the secret service men
dressed as a farming man went to'th*
suspected man's home ostensibly for the
purpose of buying hay. .-'-."
. The counterfeiter was at home and was
Â«gla4 when his visitor made a bargain
with him to purchase one hundred tons
of !Â»*- hay. The visitor said he would
have i ask the farmer to go with him to .
the nearest place,. a distance c* half a
mile or so, where he could get a draft
. cashed and pay him the first deposit on
the consignment of hay. At the- end of
their Journey the farmer found .he had
walked into the arms of the law, for an
other secret service man took care of him
while the first one went back to search j
his house. There was found a counter
feiting outfit which he had worked alone,

parable was that of the sower. It sug
gests the whole work of our Lord In his
public ministry. He came to sow "the

piophetlc is this first miracle. It suggests
the whole purpose of Christ's earthly life-
He came to ennoble, to transmute to
glorify, to divinize. As he now turned the
water Into wine, eo his entire ministry
was to be the turning of the water of

did on this occasion was to hasten the
process. This remark will apply . to all

physical and spiritual normality. Religion
is the restoration of spiritual normality

There is in the vicinity a large spring
inclosed by a wall, and if this is the true

the marriage feast at the time of our
Lord's visit was almost certainly drawn
from this spring. Water pots of compact

BY EEV. DB. KOBEKT STUART
MACABTHUB.
LET us begin with the miracle of
turning water Into wlae at Cana of
Galilee. Leaving Nazareth early in
the morning we soon come to the
traditional Cana, about four miles
east of Nazareth, on the road to Tiberias.
Some travelers, and among them Drs.
Robinson and Porter, object to the tradi
tional Cana as the Fite or the ancient
Cana. They locate it at Kana-El Jelli.
near Sepphoris. and about ' nine miles
north of Nazareth. It is by no means cer
tain which is the true site.
Some describe the view in terms of great
extravagance: others equally depreciate
it. The truth lies between. the extremes
Many, having in mind only the deserted
waste, the barren hills and the extent of
the water, will tell you that lakes in Eng
land, Scotland, Ireland and Switzerland
far surpass this view. In several resoects
they are quite right. But the thought of
Christ's presence glorifies mountains,
shore and sea. and makes this the most
interesting and transcendently beautiful
place on this globe. â¢ Â¦ . / Â¦ , Â¦ ... Â¦ ,
The lake was really the center of the
trade of the province. Here, then,, was
the tcuch with the commerce, the Indus
try and the powerful Greek Influences of
the time. Near Tiberias the water Is pol
luted with sewage, but elsewhere It Is
entirely fit for drinking purposes, although
it Is somewhat: brackish, which bracklsh
neÂ«s is duetto the salt springs on thÂ»
shore. A bath, in the lake is very enjoy
able, as in It are many warm springs.
The depression of the lake causes the
tropical heat here experienced; it also
accounts for the semi-tropical vegetation
on the chores. -Excellent fish. abound In
the lake, including several . tropical spe
cies, which now, as in Christ's day (Luko

sweetest tones, and in the night all the
inequalities were harmonized and the
peace of God rested on mountain and sea.

Perhaps the best views are at Tiberias,
looking toward Capernaum. This view I
had for hours in the soft evening light as
I sat alone by the shore near the center
of the town of Tiberias. The lake is pear
shaped, the broad end being toward the
north, or we may say that it is harp
shaped, with the bulge to the northwest.
It is between twelve and thirteen miles
long and between six and seven miles
wide, and is almost embosomed << among
the hills. The Jordan flows into it on the
northâ a muddy stream, coloring the lake
for a mile from its mouthâ and out of it
on the south, being then pure and bright.
It has been called a "gparkllng diamond
suspended by a thread." Its depth is one
hundred and sixty to two hundred. and
thirty feet;, its level varies at different
seasons, but its depression below the sur
face of the Mediterranean Sea may be put
at six hundred and eighty-two feet, al
though often it is said to be seven hun
dred feet. , .

until a spot was reached where the view
would be the finest. "Look now," said
Abdallah, my excellent. dragoman. At his
words I looked, with strangely com
mingled emotions, and had the magnifi
cent view of the sea and its surroundings
which all travelers in the holy land get
who approach It by this road.
In Isaiah, ix:l, the Sea of Galilee Is
referred to simply as "the sea." Its local

particularly, who live "south of the slot."
know and love the chapel and the rooms
of the mission building.
And rightly, for in many cases these
children are the messengers who spread
thÂ«Â» story of the means provided by the
oarnest mission workers for helping de
serving people in need. Many of those
poor tollers or discouraged ones who are
trying under the most adverse circum

way is opened by a flower, sometimes it
is a plant or a picture brought home by
a child that sets up higher ideals in ft

orce awakened in a child, are "plants
divinely nursed."
So the mothers and fathers in this dis
trict where many lives are battling

*in and the ills cf the flesh and the spirit.
are growing more and more to realize
that the aim of the mission is to be In
Its work what its name impliesâ the help
ful, uplifting and merciful Good Samar
itan.
The mission was opened May 4, 1834. at
C45 Second street, opposite the present
quarters, through the efforts. of the Rev.
William lcgraham Kip Jr.. and was
placed in his charge. Under his ministra
tions the mission increased and widened
rapidly its scope of usefulness. The Rev.
Mr Kip, now made canon, is in Pasa
dena In poor health, and Rev. J. P. Tur
ner is the priest in charge, assisted by
Rev. Dayid McClure. Ph. D.. and Rev. D.
O. Kelly.
From the first the work of the mission
was done with the assistance of the three
principles of personal contact, mutual co
operation afifi complete organization. Per
haps the most has been accomplished
through the bond of active sympathetic
union betweec the helper and thje helped.'
The leases has spread, and the poorest
and the least are growing to realize that
each must do his share in elevating him
self and helping hie neighbor.
From the five rooms of the first quar
ters. with Its Sunday school, its dubs
and little socials to which all were invit
ed, to December 27, 1236, when the cor
nerstone of the present Chapel and Mis
sion House waa laid, was a long and ar
duous step, but a .successful one. The
boy* of the section thereabouts at first
unruly did much to keep up the
Interest dcrtsgr this time, and at the end
of the first year a vested choir began Its
labors. The choir is now a very large
and fine one. On Christmas eve. 1837, the
hoy choir made the rounds of a number
of the city hotels and sang sweet old
Christmas carols. Since then the cus
tom has bees kept up every year, and
the sweet elngerc have been eagerly wait
ed for and hospitably welcomed.
The money for the erection of the pres
ent building, about S6000, was raised by
many workers through enthusiasm and a
widespread Interest In the work through
out the city, and since then many gifts
have beeo made to help in the work. The
mission waa organized as the united
work of all the Episcopal churches In
San Francisco, and the mission was made
k "Cathedral Mission" on March 18. 1897.
It represents the nucleus of the cathe
dral p!s.nt of the diocese.
The object of the mission may be sum
nr-ed up in the following words: To check
vice, to prevent pauperism, preserve self
respect, encourage self-help, and develop
as far as possible a higher moral tone
within its field of action. It does not try
to help those who are found to be un
worthy, though it refuses the aid of its
worker* and clergy to none. Poverty, of
the deserving sort, is a condition that
has been very much allexiated and bet
tered throughout the southern section of
the city by the efforts, and in many cases
the sacrifice*, made by the workers of
the Good Samaritan Mission. The mis
sion is supported by the church and by
voluntary donations and contributions.
It is under the management of the ca
thedral committee, composed of the
Birhop and the standing committee, aided
by the clergy, with an executive and an
advisory committee. -.
More room Is needed, so successful has
the work been, and it is hoped to soon
get funds to have the chapel proper and
tbe mission each occupy a distinct build
ing. Plans are being made' by which it
Is hoped to accomplish this . object, and
extend the scope and usefulness of the
mission. , J
Saturday morning is a good time to see
one of tbe most Interesting branches of
ttift mission work among the children.
Walk through tbe vestibule, into the big
ball where tbe Sunday school, lectures
and entertainments are held, and open a
door on your right. It opens into & room
that fairly blossoms with tbe bright faces
of children. From It open two more
rooms; they are filled with children, too,
and the five-year-olds are as busy as the
larger ones. They are ail sewing. The'
little ones have usually a square of cloth
stamped, upon which they are doing a
design to Kensington stitch. Borne of the '
work they turn out would do much cred
it to many older ec&mt tresses. There are
sixty of these prospective housewives,
and they *.re allowed . to take home the
garments they male*, the material being

sends out potted plants, and flowers by
the little ones who come to her with their
ailments. Last year was the first In the

vited to bring their children and their
own soap and towels every Saturday aft

bath, for In the mission, district not many

was known, many of the children cam?

down to the little tub. rHurry up, and

said. "There's the bath." The small

"That," " he piped out; "why, that's

replied In a tone of disappointment. "I d*

Initiated, and once In the tub he couldn't

If the girls did not bring washcloths
the nurse taught them how to make

said: â¢ â¢ â¢ . : .
"The Cortes have received the oath

twenty-one' guns was heard, announcing
to the city that the King had taken the i
oath. . I
King. Alfonso,. the Queen Regent and I
the Prince and Princess of the Asturlas [
withdrew from the Chamber of Deputies
*ith the same ceremonial that marked
their entry into the building, and the pro
cession was reformed and proceeded to
the San Francisco Church, which was
reached shortly after 3 p. m. Â¦' ..
CEREMONIES IN THE CHURCH.
King Alfonso was met at the portal of
the church by the Primate of Spain and
the Cardinal Archbishop of Santiago de i
Ccmpostela and twenty Bishops, all in Â¦
the magnificent robes which are only :
worn on great occasions. Eight priests
bore a canopy over the King as he ad-Â»
vanced up the central nave and. took his
seat on a throne placed beside a crimson
velvet-covered altar, specially erected in
front of the grand altar. .A. "Te Deum"
was then chanted, accompanied by a
grand orchestra., â¢â¢. . . Â» â¢
The King left "the churth with the same
ceremonial as on his entry and returned
direct to the palace.
The procession passed through the
crowded streets and re-entered the palace
where Senor Sagasta. the Prime Minister, j
presented to his Majesty the formal resig- .
nation of the Cabinet, which the King I
confirmed. . j
King Alfonso requested Premier Sa
gasta to retain the seals of office.
King Alfonso to-day for the first time
wore the uniform of a captain general,
dark blue, with gold facing and red silk
waistband, from which hung a sword and'
a steel helmet with, a white plume.
The reception met with by the proces
sion was, on the whole, lukewarm on the
part of the. immense crowds, composed
chiefly of people who had gathered to wit
ness the pageant ou\ of curiosity. On the '
Puerta del Sol no cheer was raised until
the King arrived there, when he received
an ovation, mainly, however, from the
spectators who packed the Windows and
balconies. 'â¢â¢ *.â¢
There was Rome: cheering from the peo
ple in the streets' and hats were waved,
but many men did not even uncover their
heads.
King Alfonso, who was seated on the
right of his mother, smiled continually
and acknowledged the'ctieers by bowing
and waving his -white: gloved hand.
There were several minor accidents, due
to the rushes, of the .crowds, but no fatali
ties were reported/- Â¦Â¦ Â¦
DISOTBBED BY A LUNATIC.
The ceremonie's to-day were attended by
an Incident, which, while insignificant in
Itself, for the moment created much ex
citement among those who witnessed It
-and in' the Chamber of Deputies, where
the story first arrived in a more sensa
tional 11 form* than the facts warranted.
It appears that Just as the royal coach
emerged from the- Plaza' de Armes into
the square in front of the palace, amid
the Bound of cannon a young man among
the sightseers behind the cordon sud
denly pushed through the ranks of koI
diers and police .and rushed toward the
door of the chariot, with his hat in one
hand and holding outstretched In the
other a paper.- Befpre he reached the
door the state lackeys and equerries hur
ried to the scene. and quickly overpowered
him, though not before the disturber had
received a severe mauling.
The prisoner was then taken to the
guardroom of the palace, where he was
interrogated. The letter he had in his
hand proved to- be /in address to the
King, stating .'.that -the Infanta Maria
,1 creea had promised "him - her hand, and
beeglng the -King, as the brother of the
Infanta, to 'accede to a marriage. . The
prisoner, was jcarefully searched, and it
was found that he carried no weapons.
His remarks regarding the Infanta Maria
Tf resa left no doubt as to his mental con
dltion.
The royal party reached the Chamber of
Deputies a few minuteS later, and thÂ«
Xing, ascending the throne, was greeted
v/ith a tremendous ovation, which he
nn-illingly acknowledged, r Â¦Â¦? "

KING ALFONSO TAKES THE HEIRS OF GOVERNMENT FROM QUEEN BEGENT
The Queen Regent ha* sent the follow
ing letter to the Premier, Senor Sagaftta:
In terminating to-day the regency to which

profound sadness and unexpected widowhood. I
feel from tha depth of my henrt the neceultr
of expreKiinff to the Spanish people my Immense

fection and support which I have received from

people I would be unable tf> fulfill my tnlvslun,

the bitter trials which Providence has spared
Vt, I appreciate thone virtue In til their mag

tion has been able to traverse such a profound
crfals under conditions which augur an epoch
of iranqull well being for the future. There
fore, In handing to King Alfonso XIII the pow
ers which I have exercised in hln name, I am
confident that all the Spaniards who are gath
ering around him will Inspire him with the con
fidence and fortitude necessary to fulfill the
hopes placed In him. That will be the roost
complete recompense for his mother, who, hav-
reception as the coach moved on. Until
the royal party reached the Chamber of
Deputies nothing was known by the spec
.tctors along the rest of the route of tha
incident that had Just occurred, and per
fect equanimity prevailed.
Alfonso was noticeable for his demeanor
during the ceremony -of jtaking the oath
to uphold the constitution. Dr. J. L. M.
Curry, the United/ States envoy, who was
well placed and able- to watch the pro
ceedings closely, said afterward that no
one could have had an inkling from the
King's manner that, anything extraor

LONDON, May 17.-^It is definitely de-|
riled that either Sir Thomas Llpton. Wil
liam"Waldorf Astor or Sir William Castle,
who recently placed Â£200,000 at King Ed
ward's disposal for utilitarian purposes,
will, be made coronation peers, as pre-;
viously reported. To a friend Sir Thomas
said to-day:' '
"A peerage has not been. offered me,,
and- if It should be I, while appreciating
the great honor, would be compelled to
decUne.il have no desire to .get so far
away from my friends. I am quite satls
tied-to remain as I am." Â¦ Â¦
At' the same time Sir Thomas Llpton
could have a peerage the asking, and
tbo King has himself 'suggested it.
So far as it has progressed In London,
rain, snow and hall have been England's
harbinger of summer. Never has there
been such an Inclement- spring. Americans
who have come over for the coronation
Bit around in doleful groups waiting for
the sunshine that never comes. Women
go to the opera andclubs in furs, and I the,
men have long since reverted to their
winter clothes, so prematurely discarded
'Vfo'^imount of festivities, and there are
plenty of them., can dispel the universal
gloom that the awful weather has ere-,
ated. In the northern part of the country
there was actually skating this ..week,,
â¢while an automobile trip to Scotland has
been abandoned. London itself has been
spared this last visitation, but cold north-,
e&st. winds and perpetual rain fully
brought the unsavory weather record or
the metropolis up to that of the provtncea
to-day, when It became slightly better
and warmer. Â¦-Â¦Â¦'-.., v
Among the Americans who will have a
good view of the coronation Is Lady
Charles Wolseley's 16-year-old son Eric.
Lord Wolseley. who will be close to the
sovereign throughout the ceremony, has
selected Eric to act as his page. Lady
Woiseley. was Miss Annetta Murphy of

said: â¢ â¢ â¢ . : .
"The Cortes have received the oath

to the city that the King had taken the i
oath. . I
King. Alfonso,. the Queen Regent and I
the Prince and Princess of the Asturlas [
withdrew from the Chamber of Deputies
*ith the same ceremonial that marked
their entry into the building, and the pro
cession was reformed and proceeded to
the San Francisco Church, which was
reached shortly after 3 p. m. Â¦' ..
CEREMONIES IN THE CHURCH.
King Alfonso was met at the portal of
the church by the Primate of Spain and
the Cardinal Archbishop of Santiago de i
Ccmpostela and twenty Bishops, all in Â¦
the magnificent robes which are only :
worn on great occasions. Eight priests
bore a canopy over the King as he ad-Â»
vanced up the central nave and. took his
seat on a throne placed beside a crimson
velvet-covered altar, specially erected in
front of the grand altar. .A. "Te Deum"
was then chanted, accompanied by a
grand orchestra., â¢â¢. . . Â» â¢
The King left "the churth with the same
ceremonial as on his entry and returned
direct to the palace.
The procession passed through the
crowded streets and re-entered the palace
where Senor Sagasta. the Prime Minister, j
presented to his Majesty the formal resig- .
nation of the Cabinet, which the King I
confirmed. . j
King Alfonso requested Premier Sa
gasta to retain the seals of office.
King Alfonso to-day for the first time
wore the uniform of a captain general,
dark blue, with gold facing and red silk
waistband, from which hung a sword and'
a steel helmet with, a white plume.
The reception met with by the proces
sion was, on the whole, lukewarm on the
part of the. immense crowds, composed
chiefly of people who had gathered to wit
ness the pageant ou\ of curiosity. On the '
Puerta del Sol no cheer was raised until
the King arrived there, when he received
an ovation, mainly, however, from the
spectators who packed the Windows and
balconies. 'â¢â¢ *.â¢
There was Rome: cheering from the peo
ple in the streets' and hats were waved,
but many men did not even uncover their
heads.
King Alfonso, who was seated on the
right of his mother, smiled continually
and acknowledged the'ctieers by bowing
and waving his -white: gloved hand.
There were several minor accidents, due
to the rushes, of the .crowds, but no fatali
ties were reported/- Â¦Â¦ Â¦
DISOTBBED BY A LUNATIC.
The ceremonie's to-day were attended by
an Incident, which, while insignificant in
Itself, for the moment created much ex
citement among those who witnessed It
-and in' the Chamber of Deputies, where
the story first arrived in a more sensa
tional 11 form* than the facts warranted.
It appears that Just as the royal coach
emerged from the- Plaza' de Armes into
the square in front of the palace, amid
the Bound of cannon a young man among
the sightseers behind the cordon sud
denly pushed through the ranks of koI
diers and police .and rushed toward the
door of the chariot, with his hat in one
hand and holding outstretched In the
other a paper.- Befpre he reached the
door the state lackeys and equerries hur
ried to the scene. and quickly overpowered
him, though not before the disturber had
received a severe mauling.
The prisoner was then taken to the
guardroom of the palace, where he was
interrogated. The letter he had in his
hand proved to- be /in address to the
King, stating .'.that -the Infanta Maria
,1 creea had promised "him - her hand, and
beeglng the -King, as the brother of the
Infanta, to 'accede to a marriage. . The
prisoner, was jcarefully searched, and it
was found that he carried no weapons.
His remarks regarding the Infanta Maria
Tf resa left no doubt as to his mental con
dltion.
The royal party reached the Chamber of
Deputies a few minuteS later, and thÂ«
Xing, ascending the throne, was greeted
v/ith a tremendous ovation, which he
nn-illingly acknowledged, r Â¦Â¦? "
King Alfoneo at the time of the inci

mother and the Infanta Maria Teresa

but were soon . reassured. Â¦

KING ALFONSO TAKES THE HEIRS OF GOVERNMENT FROM QUEEN BEGENT
The Queen Regent ha* sent the follow
ing letter to the Premier, Senor Sagaftta:
In terminating to-day the regency to which
1 was railed by the constitution at a 'time of
profound sadness and unexpected widowhood. I
feel from tha depth of my henrt the neceultr
of expreKiinff to the Spanish people my Immense
and unchanrinir gratitude for the proofs of af
fection and support which I have received from
all clavKn of society. If at that time I foresaw
that without the loyalty and ' confidence 'of the
people I would be unable tf> fulfill my tnlvslun,
to-day. In looklnr back on this period." the long
est of all Brianlih Â¦ regencies, and recollecting'
the bitter trials which Providence has spared
Vt, I appreciate thone virtue In til their mag
nitude, affirming that; thanks to them, -the na
tion has been able to traverse such a profound
crfals under conditions which augur an epoch
of iranqull well being for the future. There
fore, In handing to King Alfonso XIII the pow
ers which I have exercised in hln name, I am
confident that all the Spaniards who are gath
ering around him will Inspire him with the con
fidence and fortitude necessary to fulfill the
hopes placed In him. That will be the roost
complete recompense for his mother, who, hav-
reception as the coach moved on. Until
the royal party reached the Chamber of
Deputies nothing was known by the spec
.tctors along the rest of the route of tha

Alfonso was noticeable for his demeanor
during the ceremony -of jtaking the oath
to uphold the constitution. Dr. J. L. M.
Curry, the United/ States envoy, who was
well placed and able- to watch the pro

one could have had an inkling from the
King's manner that, anything extraor

gates of the palace, where -he manifested
a desire to present to the- Infanta Maria
Teresa, who is .the only Infanta not mar

sweetmeats. It Is noteworthy in this
connection that the custom nf presenting
to the King or Queen or other members
of the royal family petitions while they

from the sidewalk, raised his hat and

LONDON, May 17.-^It is definitely de-|
riled that either Sir Thomas Llpton. Wil
liam"Waldorf Astor or Sir William Castle,
who recently placed Â£200,000 at King Ed
ward's disposal for utilitarian purposes,
will, be made coronation peers, as pre-;
viously reported. To a friend Sir Thomas
said to-day:' '
"A peerage has not been. offered me,,
and- if It should be I, while appreciating
the great honor, would be compelled to
decUne.il have no desire to .get so far
away from my friends. I am quite satls
tied-to remain as I am." Â¦ Â¦
At' the same time Sir Thomas Llpton
could have a peerage the asking, and
tbo King has himself 'suggested it.
So far as it has progressed In London,
rain, snow and hall have been England's
harbinger of summer. Never has there
been such an Inclement- spring. Americans
who have come over for the coronation
Bit around in doleful groups waiting for
the sunshine that never comes. Women
go to the opera andclubs in furs, and I the,
men have long since reverted to their
winter clothes, so prematurely discarded
'Vfo'^imount of festivities, and there are
plenty of them., can dispel the universal
gloom that the awful weather has ere-,
ated. In the northern part of the country
there was actually skating this ..week,,
â¢while an automobile trip to Scotland has
been abandoned. London itself has been
spared this last visitation, but cold north-,
e&st. winds and perpetual rain fully
brought the unsavory weather record or
the metropolis up to that of the provtncea
to-day, when It became slightly better
and warmer. Â¦-Â¦Â¦'-.., v
Among the Americans who will have a
good view of the coronation Is Lady
Charles Wolseley's 16-year-old son Eric.
Lord Wolseley. who will be close to the
sovereign throughout the ceremony, has
selected Eric to act as his page. Lady
Woiseley. was Miss Annetta Murphy of
San Francisco. . . '
As regards the London season, of which
so 'much was expected, the fact Is that up

usual at this time of the year.

begun several days ago, ha* been steadily
maintained and is such as to give i mnch
encouragement." â¢ - ,
LONDON, May 17.â The Foreign Offlea
officials here say there Is no truth in the
report circulated in the United States that
PAUNCEFOTE HAS NOT

tled. Most horrifying de
tails of the condition of the Carlb coun
try, where thousands of cattle and human
corpses lay in a state of decomposition
for several days during the agitation, are
revealed. Although the number of deaths
In the Island due to the disaster is esti
mated, judging from the missing inhabit
ants, at 2vX>0, up to the night of May 13,
only 121S bodies had been burled.
The undiscovered bodies are probably
covered with lava. In a small shop which
was opened three days after the eruption
eighty-seven decaying corpses were dis
covered, and not one of them was recog
! r.izable. In the dwelling house of the
manager of one of the estates thirty
corpses were found in a similar condition, j
and other sickening discoveries have been j
; made. The district is being rapidly |
; cleared. A number of patients nave, been
| brought to this city. Many are Buttering
trom fractured skulls caused by thÂ«
! stones thrown from the volcano, and ;a'
majority of them were burned by the lava
thrown up with the vapor.
LAVA IS STILL HOT.
! Toward evening yesterday there was a
slight convulsion, followed by a small dis
charge of smoke, but this caused no
alarm. The wtather is. line and the ex
citement is abating. The bed of lava In
the Windward district is still hot. The
abvss, 1500 feet Ueep and -200 feet wide,
which existed between Langiey Park and
Habacci is lilled with lava, and the prin
cipal features of the mountain on cither'
sloe are apparently more beautiful than
1 before the eruption.
' A curious circumstance connected with
the eruption is that the earthquakes were
not general, notwithstanding the small
ness of the island. While at Chateau
Belaire the convulsions preceding the
t- ruption of May 7 were almost continuous
every few hours, in Kingston and George
town only sixty shocks were felt in four
hours.
Although attended with smaller loss of
lite, the eruption of La Soutriere was not
les* violent than that of Mont Pelee, in
the island of Martinique. The area cov
ered by lava comprises sixteen square
miles.
MANY FLEE TO SAFETY.
The fact that the loss of life and
damage to property in St. Vincent were
smaller than in Martiuicue is due to the
position of La Soufriere and the smaller
population of the district, the mountain
overhanging ' sugar and arrowroot es
tates and a couple of thinly populated ,
villages, whose inhabitants were given j
warning of the approaching disaster an 1
tied for their lives.- All the villagers who
remained were killed. - . Â¦
The officials of St. Vincent are busy
relieving the sufferers and housing the
sick and homeless. The problem now fac
ing the Government is how to provide per
manently for the natives who lost houses,
lands and everything they possessed. The
peasant settlements may be formed on
the estates, the lands of which the Gov
! eminent possesses the legal machinery
to appropriate, but money is needed to
assist the settlers to build houses thereon

WlÂ£ tonih of further eruptions of
iSn^ . the volcano of Soufriere, the

and to provide them with sustenance dur

There are millions of flies at St. Pierre,

The new eruption of Mont Pelee covered
the party examining -the consulate with
ashes, which'choked and blinded''them.
They covered their mouths with camphor
bandapes and reached the Potomac with
difficulty. . ',
Apothecaryâ¢" Gllmore of the Cincinnati
says Pompeii and Herculaneum are no

when they returned to the seashore. The
small boats in the heavy sea which came
out to the Potomac narrowly escaped
swamping. The trip throughout was
thrilling and memorable. I found eight
een bodies in a space twenty-five feet
square.
The Potomac probably proceeds on Mon
day to Guadeloupe to transfer Ayme's
consular effects to Fort de France. The
looting was not exaggerated by the press.
I- saw one party, a white man and six
negroes, with plunder, run from the beach
when the Potomac party appeared.

M. D.. Washington, D. C. published In

which this remedy for curing Lost
Manhood is prepared:
During the examination of mra for the army ;

St&tec army physicians wrre shocked to find
â¢o large a. percentaLffe of men disqualified be-

Among those whose attention haÂ»
been attracted by this magnanimous
offer Is the Rev. J. S. B. Crawford of
VÂ»'Â£> nesville, X. C, a very prominent
divine, whose own vitality was serious-
rjr impaired. Being sick of paying
money to quacks and charlatans, who
*. wok his money without doing him any
good. Mr. Crawford had the prescrip-
tion made up and took it regularly, as
he was directed. With this result, he
was perfectly cured, and after several
years of enjoyment of his newly givan
powers, made the statement publicly
that every man in need of help should
do likewise.
There are not many ministers who
would be willing to publicly indorse
and recommend a cure of this kind,
with the statement that they them-
selves had been cured by It, but the
Rev. Crawford has in him a great
deal of true gratitude and love of man-
kind. This is Fhown in a recent letter
ic which he tars that he makes public
acknowledgment "in order that othera
may receive the same happy results."
You are older now and can look back
and see the mistakes you have made.
but you cannot recall the vigor and fire
of the springtime of robust manhood.
Tour transgressions have left thei*-
rcark upon you. Your errors and ex-
cesses have ravaged your system and
undermined your nerve force. Quick-*
nees, backache, nervousness arid debil-
itating drains and worn-out, shrunken
and lifeless organs are making your
life a miserable existence, devoid of
pleasure. You hesitate and falter; you
are r.ot thÂ« man you once were, and
you know it. Cast aside your modesty.
This matter is too Imnbrtant. Act at
ence with manly decision.
This formula is printed and costs ma Â¦
felmoft nothing, and I give it free of
any charge. X do not ask It. but if you
desire to do bo, you can pay something
after using it. I want to help every
ftuffering man ln America to regain his
health and strength ard the ability to
enjoy the pleasures of life an I do. Ad-

tails of the condition of the Carlb coun

for several days during the agitation, are
revealed. Although the number of deaths
In the Island due to the disaster is esti
mated, judging from the missing inhabit
ants, at 2vX>0, up to the night of May 13,
only 121S bodies had been burled.
The undiscovered bodies are probably
covered with lava. In a small shop which
was opened three days after the eruption
eighty-seven decaying corpses were dis
covered, and not one of them was recog
! r.izable. In the dwelling house of the
manager of one of the estates thirty
corpses were found in a similar condition, j
and other sickening discoveries have been j
; made. The district is being rapidly |
; cleared. A number of patients nave, been
| brought to this city. Many are Buttering
trom fractured skulls caused by thÂ«
! stones thrown from the volcano, and ;a'
majority of them were burned by the lava
thrown up with the vapor.
LAVA IS STILL HOT.
! Toward evening yesterday there was a
slight convulsion, followed by a small dis
charge of smoke, but this caused no
alarm. The wtather is. line and the ex
citement is abating. The bed of lava In
the Windward district is still hot. The
abvss, 1500 feet Ueep and -200 feet wide,
which existed between Langiey Park and
Habacci is lilled with lava, and the prin
cipal features of the mountain on cither'
sloe are apparently more beautiful than
1 before the eruption.
' A curious circumstance connected with
the eruption is that the earthquakes were
not general, notwithstanding the small
ness of the island. While at Chateau
Belaire the convulsions preceding the
t- ruption of May 7 were almost continuous
every few hours, in Kingston and George
town only sixty shocks were felt in four
hours.
Although attended with smaller loss of
lite, the eruption of La Soutriere was not
les* violent than that of Mont Pelee, in
the island of Martinique. The area cov
ered by lava comprises sixteen square
miles.
MANY FLEE TO SAFETY.
The fact that the loss of life and
damage to property in St. Vincent were
smaller than in Martiuicue is due to the
position of La Soufriere and the smaller
population of the district, the mountain
overhanging ' sugar and arrowroot es
tates and a couple of thinly populated ,
villages, whose inhabitants were given j
warning of the approaching disaster an 1
tied for their lives.- All the villagers who
remained were killed. - . Â¦
The officials of St. Vincent are busy
relieving the sufferers and housing the
sick and homeless. The problem now fac
ing the Government is how to provide per
manently for the natives who lost houses,
lands and everything they possessed. The
peasant settlements may be formed on
the estates, the lands of which the Gov
! eminent possesses the legal machinery
to appropriate, but money is needed to
assist the settlers to build houses thereon

To every one who writes in good faith
I will send the full formula, of thN
wonderful medicine. This prescription
and fuil directions are sent free. Have
it filled, or if you deelre, you can buy

Just as well yourself. One prescription
uill make a new man of you. One dose

marvelous power. Â¦
Among those whose attention haÂ»
been attracted by this magnanimous
offer Is the Rev. J. S. B. Crawford of
VÂ»'Â£> nesville, X. C, a very prominent
divine, whose own vitality was serious-
rjr impaired. Being sick of paying
money to quacks and charlatans, who
*. wok his money without doing him any
good. Mr. Crawford had the prescrip-
tion made up and took it regularly, as
he was directed. With this result, he
was perfectly cured, and after several
years of enjoyment of his newly givan
powers, made the statement publicly
that every man in need of help should
do likewise.
There are not many ministers who
would be willing to publicly indorse
and recommend a cure of this kind,
with the statement that they them-
selves had been cured by It, but the
Rev. Crawford has in him a great
deal of true gratitude and love of man-
kind. This is Fhown in a recent letter
ic which he tars that he makes public
acknowledgment "in order that othera
may receive the same happy results."
You are older now and can look back
and see the mistakes you have made.
but you cannot recall the vigor and fire
of the springtime of robust manhood.
Tour transgressions have left thei*-
rcark upon you. Your errors and ex-
cesses have ravaged your system and
undermined your nerve force. Quick-*
nees, backache, nervousness arid debil-
itating drains and worn-out, shrunken
and lifeless organs are making your
life a miserable existence, devoid of
pleasure. You hesitate and falter; you
are r.ot thÂ« man you once were, and
you know it. Cast aside your modesty.
This matter is too Imnbrtant. Act at
ence with manly decision.
This formula is printed and costs ma Â¦
felmoft nothing, and I give it free of
any charge. X do not ask It. but if you
desire to do bo, you can pay something
after using it. I want to help every
ftuffering man ln America to regain his
health and strength ard the ability to
enjoy the pleasures of life an I do. Ad-

Reports from their representative at

of tbÂ« German I Reichstag, representing

to the prohibition of American dried

Hugo Zimmerman, the agent for the

his home office from Hamburg, "tates that
there Is every indication that influence

through the sulphur process. ; -

WASHINGTON. v May 17.â The House
spent the day in discussing the navai ap
propriation; bill and the most Important
feature of the discussion Involved a re
vival of the Sampson-Schley controversy.
This arose over an amendment to the bill,
which was presented by Mudd . of Mary
land and, which was adopted, prohibiting
the use of Maclay's history of : the navy
as a textbook at the Naval Academy.
During the debate the .Representatives
generally denounced the book for its un
warranted criticism of Schley. ' , -
. Jones of Washington offered an amend
ment of $60,000 for a key wall at the naval
station, ruget Bound, Washington. Can
non - remaraed that there â¢ were entirely
too many of them. It was necessary to
divide a little > dough among too many
chickens. And all this was because of
the fact that too many members are In
terested In existing stations.
Foss concurred in the last remark, Buy
ing he, would like to see many yards and
stations discontinued, but as this was im
possible in view of local interest, it be
hooved Congress to do the best it could
under the circumstances In the Interest
of frugality and good service. .
, Galnes of Tennessee suggested that if
the appropriations wer* to be reduced it
would be well to begin by cutting down
the appropriations for the insular: posses
sions of the United States. . .
; Wheeler of Kentucky declared that
those items in the bill had nothing to do
with the foreign policy of the United
States, saying he thought there was no
item In the bill that should -go out.
"Will the gentleman tell me what Is
the foreign policy of our. Government?"
asked Gaines.
. "Nobody but God Almighty and a few
Republican : leaders know," responded
Wheeler. ' ,
. The Jones amendment was agreed to.
Cooper of Texas offered an amendment
appropriating $20,000 for making tests of
liquid fuel from the California and Texas
oil fields under the direction of the Bu
reau of Steam Engineering. Cooper stat
ed that these tests were recommended by
Admiral Melville, chief of the Bureau of
Steam Engineering of the Navy Depart
ment, and by the Secretary of the Navy.
The amendment was accepted.

957 to 977 Market Street, Opp. Golden Gate Avenue.Rich, Land-Owners Are Â¦ Trying to
Prevent Imports of American
Dried Fruits. Â¦
Reports from their representative at
Hamburg to the Ernst Packing Company
of Sulsun show that the Agrarian party
of tbÂ« German I Reichstag, representing
the landowners. Is now paying attention
to the prohibition of American dried
fruits. "The reason put forth is- that, the
dried fruits are sulphurized,-- "
Hugo Zimmerman, the agent for the
Ernst Packing Company. In his letters to
his home office from Hamburg, "tates that
there Is every indication that influence
wltl be brought to bear, by the German
Government to try to destroy the Ameri
can dried fruit trade by placing restric
tions on dried fruits that have gone
through the sulphur process. ; -
, Edward James Wlckson. M. -A., pro
fessor of agricultural practice at Berke
ley says that where sulphuring Is prop
er^ done the natural color Is largely re
tained 4n dried -products, and all deposits
of eermi and worms in the fruits are
eliimn^ed. which otherwise would render
the fruit not only lndurable but un
wholesome. â¢ Â¦ .

WASHINGTON. v May 17.â The House
spent the day in discussing the navai ap
propriation; bill and the most Important
feature of the discussion Involved a re
vival of the Sampson-Schley controversy.
This arose over an amendment to the bill,
which was presented by Mudd . of Mary
land and, which was adopted, prohibiting
the use of Maclay's history of : the navy
as a textbook at the Naval Academy.
During the debate the .Representatives
generally denounced the book for its un
warranted criticism of Schley. ' , -
. Jones of Washington offered an amend
ment of $60,000 for a key wall at the naval
station, ruget Bound, Washington. Can
non - remaraed that there â¢ were entirely
too many of them. It was necessary to
divide a little > dough among too many
chickens. And all this was because of
the fact that too many members are In
terested In existing stations.
Foss concurred in the last remark, Buy
ing he, would like to see many yards and
stations discontinued, but as this was im
possible in view of local interest, it be
hooved Congress to do the best it could
under the circumstances In the Interest
of frugality and good service. .
, Galnes of Tennessee suggested that if
the appropriations wer* to be reduced it
would be well to begin by cutting down
the appropriations for the insular: posses
sions of the United States. . .
; Wheeler of Kentucky declared that
those items in the bill had nothing to do
with the foreign policy of the United
States, saying he thought there was no
item In the bill that should -go out.
"Will the gentleman tell me what Is
the foreign policy of our. Government?"
asked Gaines.
. "Nobody but God Almighty and a few
Republican : leaders know," responded
Wheeler. ' ,
. The Jones amendment was agreed to.
Cooper of Texas offered an amendment
appropriating $20,000 for making tests of
liquid fuel from the California and Texas
oil fields under the direction of the Bu
reau of Steam Engineering. Cooper stat
ed that these tests were recommended by
Admiral Melville, chief of the Bureau of
Steam Engineering of the Navy Depart
ment, and by the Secretary of the Navy.
The amendment was accepted.

of a duel between himself and Greene,'
tut the report was denied. Subsequently
the sensational report gained currency
that thousands : of stands of arms had
been smuggled j Into Sonora from the
United. States, presumably for the warring
Yaqul Indians. It was stated that â¢ the
arms were Eagan's and that he ; was pre-'

The Mexican courts decided In Eagan's
favor, although Greene claimed ' to have
purchased the land before. It. was given
to Eagan by the Government. Since the

had his retainers, consisting of cowboys,'
Indians and border ruffians, -who 1 were

, The assertions of the critics are indisputably true, but they do not constitute a valid criti
cism upon President Patton's statement. Mediocrity does not imply anything derogatory to the
race. It means only that there is no marked superiority of one individual above another. The big
man of a village may be a mediocrity in a city and yet be a better ; man than he was in the village.
The men of our time may be mediocre and still accomplish- much more thanSvas^ possible by the
foremost men of a. century- ago. President Patton's words meant no more than the assertion that
in our time the affairs of the world are managed by men who are not much superior 'to their
fellow-men, and that statement cannot be refuted by citations of what has been achieved over and
beyond the achievements o'f the past. ,, . . â¢ " * y

PRESIDENT PATTON of Princeton has stirred up something like a hornet's nest of
critics by asserting that the twentieth century has dawned upon a mediocre race. The
critics assert that the nineteenth century closed with a blaze of brilliant- achievements in
the domain of science, industry and politics, and that the new century finds hupaiiity
more potent, elevated and enterprising than. ever before at any period of its career.
A QUESTION OF MEDIOCRITY.
At the Lorlng Club concert of Tuesday
evening next, that completes the twenty
fifth season of the club, will be -given a
new composition by Arthur Foote. writ
ten especially for the occasion. The club
during its quarter century of existence
has devoted much attention to the chorus
work of Mr. Foote, who thus gracefully
takes the opportunity of acknowledging
a return interest in their efforts. Tho
composition In question Is a setting of
Tennyson's "The Miller's Daughter," that
certainly affords' the composer a chance
for picturesque treatment. The chorus
will give Its most careful attention to the
Interpretation of Mr. Foote's friendly
tributes, and offers a goodly programme
besides. The soloists will be Dr. S. Schalk
hammer and W. E. Dyer, and there is to
bo an orchestra In addition to the usual
piano and organ accompaniment for the
auspicious occasion.
On Friday evening the second cencert
of the Philharmonic Society will take
place at Metropolitan Temple. Mrs. M.
K. Blanchard will sing and Mr. Mlnettl
has planned an interesting orchestral pro
gramme. \
The fourth free organ recital at Trinity
Church on Thursday evening next by
Louis H. Eaton, organist of the church,
will Include the Wldor fifth symphony,
the Thlele concert-satz in C minor and
some lesser numbers. J. F^Veaco will be
the vocalist andLHother Wismer's violin
will add much to .the Interest of the fine
programme. The attendance at these re
citals is steadily increasing.
The recitals of Mrs. M. E. Blanchard of
Tuesday and Saturday last, under the
auspices of the Channinsr Auxiliary, were
very enjoyable. The charming contralto
was heard in two choice programmes that
included a highly varied and comprehen
sive collection of songs.
It was an exquisite programme and I
doubt that any will forget It who were
privileged to hear. It will not surprise
those who did to learn that Senor Pablo
Casals is a composer of some attainment;
that he has already done much conduct
ing; that he plays the oboe, trombone,
piano and something else besidesâ I for
get what: and regards it as one of his
favorite amusements to play the whole
of 'Tristan and Isolde" In an evening,
ringing meantime all the solos and every
thing else in the gamut of one voice all by
heart. Also that he numbers yet only 25
years, and that he leaves here next week.
They all do.
any limitation of vision â¬ or reach. Tem
perament, intellect and mechanical facil
ity seem all to be equally present In ihelr
highest power, and in their combination
give a musician whose like some of us
shall not look upon again. He haa a
ravishing tone, in its golden deeps like
an organ and again delicate as Ysaye's
violin. He phrases and reads Beethoven
as Bernhardt reads Racine; Interprets
Bach with the same illumined clarity,
.and Is equally at home with the slighter
beauties of Saint-Saenn.
with Daly?" I flung Into another sprout^
Ing silence. " . ' . , Â» '
Â¦ "Mr. Daly started, us with The Merry
Wives of Windsor,' and of course thera
was. the 'As You Like It,'" the actor
laconically replied.
I told him here, to some apparent inter
est, of our successful Shakespearean pre
sentations of last season, afterward ask
ing: "What of your modern plays? You
like best The Bauble Shop'?"
"No.- Possibly 'Rosemary,' '* the player
replied, then went on, "You have seen me
in 'Rosemary'?"
"Indeed, yes."
"A beautiful play, a beautiful play!"
"How about Ibsen?"
"Unpleasant, Isn't he?"
"We had Blanche Bates iT^Hedda Gab
ler'' last year and enjoyed it"
"How. did she do?" Mr. Drew inquired.
I told him, and then asked if it were not
rather surprising to find such interest as
was taken in the play so far away from
the "centers of etc." |
"Oh! San Francisco has always count
ed for more than she should," said tha
player, unexpectedly voluble. "You have
only 300.000 peopleâ are there?â and yet
you hear and see almost everything. Wty
should you not know things?"
"Dees New York think we do? Aren't
we classed as very 'woolly* down East?"
"Not at all." Mr. Drew declared. "And
I like San Francisco.. It is* like coming
home to come here. I know so many peo
ple. Did 'you see the house on* Monday
night? Quite touched me. I have been
down at Burlingame (he did not Anglicise
the word) all day. Very pleasant."
Then Mr. Drew looked at me In tho
"make-up" mirror as if slightly aston
ished that he had said so much. Silenca
again threatened, but I was to the forÂ»
in time to save the minute. \
"Some of us feel, Mr. Drewâ thoutja
The Second in Command' is a good pU;A
tltat John Drew should be doing larger
things."
."Where am I to' get them?" he asked.
"Who's writing *em'<? Jones* and Pinero's
last plays have disappointed. Ibsen can
not be popularized."
"What of Shaw?*'
" T.he Devil's Disciple'â have you seen
it?â is a splendid play," and a flash ct
enthusiasm lighted up the heavy-lidded
eyes for a moment. *â¢ $ .
. "Why not Shaw, then?"
"Mansfield has The Devil's Disciple."*
replied the actor. 'Then there is 'Cap-'
tain Brassbound's Conversion* â an excel
lent play. But all of Bernard Shaw's
comeaies require a leading man or woman
for every part. Difficult to get."
"Yes, in these daya of stars,"* I said.
"In Daly's lime '* â¢-.- â¢-â¢â¢
Silence the fifth.
"I like The Second in Command,' how*
ever." volunteered Mr. Drew.
"You make it."
"My companyâ"
â¢"Is ever so well suited to the play and
very adequate." I granted. "You have a
new leading lady ne'xt season. I hear?"
"Yes; Miss Margaret Dale."
"A great favorite with us," I said, and
Mr. Drew here certainly looked pleased.
Then to my questioning he spoke of his
daughter. Miss Louise, now acting with
the company, and showing more than a
little promise in her work. He acknowl
edged also to being a "loyal Philadel
phian" and fellow-townsman of David
Blspbam. and to a predilection for horse
back riding. Then on my taking' leave,
Mr. Drew, still in the "Blnks" staccato,
was good enough to express a half-repret
that he did not interview easily. But 1
am not by any means persuaded that I
have Interviewed John Drew. Blnks is
the person and the joke is on me.
RISING YOUNG MUSICIAN OF
THIS CITY. PHOTOGRAPH BY
MAURER.
THERE, are people who are more
Interesting from the things they
do not do than ' from the things
that have included themselves in
their repertoire as proper to be
done. Off 'the stage John Drew is of the
elect of these, with a capacity for
not 'doing the expected s thing that is
nothing short Â¦- of the phenomenal.
I ' find ' few people unwilling to
discuss j their art, still fewer the fas
cinating subject of .themselves, and 'Mr.
Drew 'Is one of the few. The Interview
seems to suggest itself to the famous
player as one of the inevitable nuisances
of civilization, to be classed with' the dent
ist and the -sewage system, something to
thank God for with a very mitigated
gratitude. Perfectly courteous, he sub
mits to the necessity, but with much the
air of one having his breast to the enemy â
an enemy armed with a pea-shooter, until \
one Is almost as absurdly sorry for him
as one Is for oneself.
There is a deal of Major "Kit" Bing
ham. by the way, about Mr. Drew behind
the scenes, unlessâ base suspicion!â the
actor was Imposing upon my vernal Inno
cence the other day by jestingly continu
ing the performance. He has the same al
most diffidence of manner, the same gift
of silence, the same .military precision of
saying what he does say and the same Im
maculate perfection' of get-up. Not a
hair was out of place on the sleek Drew
head. The tie, trews, shoes and the rest
were, the perfection of elegant unobstru
siveness. So, too, with the Drew manner,
which least of all the professions sug
gests the actor. The only thing that does
obtrude itself in fact is the glittering lack
of all obtrusiveness. Even the dressing
room, where last week Maxlne Ellldtt's
frills and laces reigned supreme, bore the
unmistakable stamp of Its owner's occu
pancy. It" was like a barrack room for
neatness, the Drew orderly putting the
last things to rights with miraculous dis
patch as I went in.,
v ,Â¦.Â¦Â¦â¢â¢â¢â¢'/.
With quite the "BInks" manner Mr.
Drew 'greeted me, courteous, soldierly,
taciturn. â¢ â¢ . â¢
" 'Frald I am a very uncommunicative
chap," he said. "Don't like much to talk
about myself. Fellows that talk much
about themselves can't be very enjoyable
âeh?' Take a seat.!'
"Thanks. That depends who the fel
low Is," I said, instinctively copying the
Blnks manner. Â¦ Â¦
. "Does it?" he asked.'
I should doubtless have said here, "You
bet your life it does," if dim visions of a
guardhouse had not obtruded 'themselves.
- Nothing -dampened, however, I said,
"Yes, it does depend. Mr. Drew on him
self and his work would be Interesting to
anybody "
Silence.
More silence. â Â¦
Mr. Drew ' waited comfortably for ma
to say something else.- ~~
" "Erâ havo you . a favorite part?" I
stammered, getting slightly nervous."
"Petruchio," " the actor: said, with a
suspicion of enthusiasm. '
"Ah, yes! I saw that.. Years ago. With
Ada Rehan. ft was Immense," I ex
claimed,-with the glad feeling of at last
having found my feet. "Why don'^ you
give us something of that kind now?"
v "Where, is tho Katherine?" Mr. Drew
inquired, and volunteered further,
"Shakespeare has no vogue now." I
. "I understand that Henrietta Crosman
has lately made a hit as Rosalind," I sug
gested.: '/Â¦Â¦'Â¦*.â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦..Â¦'-â¢Â¦" Â¦ Â¦ - v
Mr. Drew considered for a moment, than
said; /'Yes.' Miss Crosman also made a
favorable impression as .Nell Gwynne.
She waa the Cella In the Daly production
of 'As You . Like It.* "
"But she is not in i the syndicate?" *
"No." , : . â¢
"Trouble?" : : y
"Of that I have nothing to say," Mr.
Drew, said, and smiled slightlyâ a very
pleasant smile. '
"But Is there no one besides Miss Cros
man?" I : queried. ; v. - : â¢ . '
"Well,. you cannot expect an actress to
step at onoe from the colloquial, Into the
Shakespearean drama," was the answer.
"There, Is now almost no opportunity for
that kind of education." â¢ ' .'.
"What comes next to Petruchio in your
favor?" Â¦Â¦':<Â¦â y.,:~ :''. ;â"'. "Â¦ ..'Â¦Â¦Â¦ ; -. . : - ;% : â¢"

Certainly one has deserved - something
at the bands of the gods who was privi
leged to hear the Casals' programme of
Thursday afternoon last at the Musicians'
reception. I do not hope for such another
pure revel of good music as there fell to
my share for many long days to come.
The only pity of It -was that the affair
was cot public, that every one could not
have the chance of hearing one of the
noblest artists that "has ever been heard
here. Senor Casals, it will be remem
bered, came here . with Mme.. Nevada,
making a profound impression at the two
concerts f given by the singer. He was
detained here through a slight accident
to his hand,' and the musicians "of' the
city, determined to hear again one so emi
nently gifted, gave him a reception and
musicale last Thursday. . A programme of
particular appeal to the musician was
chospn, in which were included sonatas
by Beethoven, Bach and Locatelli, with
some jewels of the modern French school
by Saint-Saens, Jean Hure and Gabriel
Faure. Mr. Bendix and Mr. Maurer were
summoned to the piano and the musicians
bidden to the feast.
accompanist's simple instinct serves him,
wherewith every shade of color, every lift
and fall of the tempo, is felt with almost
mathematical nicety. Mr. Maurer has this
faculty to an unusual degree, and only
those who have followed the city's con
cert history for the last two years know
what good work has been done in this di
rection by the young artist. Mr. Maurer' s
effort is distinguished by the keenest sym
pathy, a delicate discretion and robust
judgment that mark it as of the best of Its
Technically, it is etlll a little wanting,
but that will come. Meantime Mr. Maurer
remains among the most valuable mem
bers of the local musical fraternity. He
is very sensibly cultivating the rare art of

though, so far as the Hyperion locks are
concerned, he is admirably equipped for a

haps Â¦ selfishly, rejoice at his abstention,
&nd listeners cot a few. I can answer for
one.
AT the- Blanchard recitals of this
week, at the musicians' recep
tion to Mr. Casals of Thursday,
at the Fisk recitals of a month
or so ago and at many other
musical affairs of the season a conspicu
ous feature of the programme has been,
the excellent accompanying of Fred
Maurer. a. rising young; musician of the
town. By the very nature of the art. that
of forming an efficient background for
the soloist's effort, the follower of the
craft Is very frequently forgotten when
the honors of the performance come to be
assigned. Paradoxically, it is often true
that the better the accompanist the
scanter the attention directed to his la
bors. 'Given a soloist pulling one way and
his accompanist every other, the person
at the piano will never have v reason to
complain of Indifference on the part -of
the audience. It is only when matters go
as they should, when the accompaniment
sways and ebbs and flows with every pulse
of the singer, that the ingrate listener
â¢'forgets to remember" â as the Japanese
bayâ that his enjoyment is largely owing
to the unobtrusive artist at the piano end
of things.
Accompanists, like poets, are born, not
made. It is a peculiar gift that in its ab
sence can never be quite successfully
counterfeited. It is a sort , of prophetic
Instinct, that telegraphs unerringly to its
owner the intent and musical desire of the
person whom he is supporting. By no
capacity of calculation can -this be real
ized to the marvelous extent to which the
FAMOUS ACTOR WHO IB PLATING
BEFORE LARGE AND FASHION
" ABDE AUDIENCES. ' ./
IS IT PROVIDENTIAL?
In one view of this fear-inspiring calamity good comes out of its awful suffering. "All over
the world pity's sweet fountain is made affluent and the first and highest of the Christian virtues
is quickened, and the spirit of helpfulness and charity is abroad, and food and medicine, clothing
and comfort, freight the swift ships that go to the rescue of the stricken. But again, why need'
innocent Ghildhood perish in the fire and piety die upon bended knee, in order that the millions
far away may be touched to tenderness toward those that suffer?
At the end, as in the beginning, it is a mysteryâ a part, of that riddle held closer, than the
secret of the Sphinx, which no finite eye may read and no man's hand untanerle.
John Wesley in his sermon on the cause and cure of earthquakes said they were caused by
the wickedness of man, and their cure was universal righteousnesl. But if only universal right
eousness will prevent them, and Providence be omnipotent/ why let the many righteous, the vast
majority of the sinless, go on perishing with the few wicked, while waiting for righteous unan
imity? It is not in the understood order of Providence that the innocent shall suffer for
the guilty. Â¦ .
Teleology seeks for a first cause. May not that cause have been the architect of the
physical universe, the source of its unchangeable laws/ the planter of the germ of life which has
flowered in man, -and then have left all things material to act and react upon eacH other?
May it not be concluded, then, that the Providence which rules that empire employs no
physical force in its system of rewards and punishments? May men remain devout, be Christian,
keep the commandments, live by the golden rule, and still be left to their own foresight and re
sources for protection against wind and weather, title and tempest, earthquake and volcano?
When human reason is applied to the appalling riddle may it not differentiate the physical
from the metaphysical, .the material from the spiritual? Napoleon did. that, -He accounted for his
profound decline by saying that he founded a material empire/ for which no man offered himself
in sacrifice after the structure crumbled and its creator was a prisoner. But that the spiritual em
pire, whose founder perished miserably upon Calvary, had been defended by the blood of martyrs
and the consecration of saints in'alla'ges; 2fter ; human f power had jeered at and crucified its
head. The conqueror of kingdoms affirmed this as evidence of the presence of "spiritual power
that ruled an ineffable empire with no relation to material things.
It is the devout belief of the world that a kind and watchful Providence presides over what
we call the manifestations of nature. Men implore that power to send the early and the latter
rain. Men are called to righteousness by the promise of reward and they are driven from wick
edness by the fear of punishment. . V
It is a great mystery. Why did the righteous perish by tens of thousands, and one wicked,
a murderer, pass through that furnace alive and untouched by fire?
But this was also in punishment for wickedness that only fire could purge and cleanse.
There is no known evidence that the cities of the islands were wicked. The rain of fire and brim
stone fell upon St. Pierre in the early morning of a solemn Christian festival. It was Ascension
day, hallowed by all believers of every creed. / The great cathedral was crowded by devout wor
shipers. At every altar and shrine in the doomed city and in every home, the thoughts of the
people were upon that scene, when "He led them out as far as Bethany, and hevjifted up his hands
and blessed them, and it came to pass, while he. blessed them, he was parted from them and car
ried up into heaven.". Just as thousands of men and women and innocent children felt the impress
of that blessing, fire and brimstone, smothering Jiot ashes and. deadly fumes fell upon them from
the heavens and they perished awfully. The temples blazed in the consuming heat, and the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke from a furnace. :
Of all the thousands living but a moment before, in that fajthfur city, only one lived after
the tempest of flame had passed. When searchers went into the midst of that appalling scene of
death and desolation they found in a. stone cell of the jail, alive and unhurt, a negro murderer,
chained to the wall where he awaited the execution of the death sentence* of the - law. When're
leased he rose and fled. Lot, the righteous man, was saved out of Sodom. A murderer was saved
ojit of St. Pierre. â¢ â¢ . , .
Earlier than this destruction of Korah, Sodom and Gomorrah /were consumed by fire. After
the faithful Lot had been warned to flee, the account of the catastrophe given in Genesis might,
with but little paraphrase, be read as the awful story of St. Pierre: "And the sun wa^s. risen upon
the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities and all the plain,
and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground; And Abraham gat up
in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord, and he looked toward Sodom and
Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo! the smoke! of the country went
up as the smoke of a furnace." â¢ , '
eF old such events as the ; overwhelming v of thousands in .Martinique â¢ and St. Vincent
were traced -to direct, ''intelligent;. and; intended action' of Providence. They were
attributed to a spirit of admonition for the warning :of : the' wicked and a purpose
to destroy Jor hardness of theart. When Korati and his company were destroyed it
is writtenthat Moses.said: "If these men. die the common death .' of '. all men, or if they be visited
affer visitation of all men, then the Lx>rd hath not sent me. But i( the Lord make a new thing,
arid the earth opencth her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain to them, and they
Â£0 down quick into the .pit, then ye shall understand that these men ; have provoked the Lord;
And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up anc\ their houses.;; They and all that
appertained unto them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them, and they
perished from amongst the congregation, artel there came out a fire frbmHhe Lord and consumed
the twohundred and fifty men that offered incense." / Â¦Â¦-â¢â¢; Â¦ }."Â¦>:'.' .
But this was punishment of Korah and his company for complaining that Moses took too.
much to himself and set himself above the congregation. â¢ â¢Â¦'Â¦

, The assertions of the critics are indisputably true, but they do not constitute a valid criti
cism upon President Patton's statement. Mediocrity does not imply anything derogatory to the
race. It means only that there is no marked superiority of one individual above another. The big
man of a village may be a mediocrity in a city and yet be a better ; man than he was in the village.
The men of our time may be mediocre and still accomplish- much more thanSvas^ possible by the
foremost men of a. century- ago. President Patton's words meant no more than the assertion that
in our time the affairs of the world are managed by men who are not much superior 'to their
fellow-men, and that statement cannot be refuted by citations of what has been achieved over and
beyond the achievements o'f the past. ,, . . â¢ " * y

PRESIDENT PATTON of Princeton has stirred up something like a hornet's nest of
critics by asserting that the twentieth century has dawned upon a mediocre race. The
critics assert that the nineteenth century closed with a blaze of brilliant- achievements in
the domain of science, industry and politics, and that the new century finds hupaiiity
more potent, elevated and enterprising than. ever before at any period of its career.
A QUESTION OF MEDIOCRITY.
At the Lorlng Club concert of Tuesday
evening next, that completes the twenty
fifth season of the club, will be -given a
new composition by Arthur Foote. writ
ten especially for the occasion. The club
during its quarter century of existence
has devoted much attention to the chorus
work of Mr. Foote, who thus gracefully
takes the opportunity of acknowledging
a return interest in their efforts. Tho
composition In question Is a setting of
Tennyson's "The Miller's Daughter," that
certainly affords' the composer a chance
for picturesque treatment. The chorus
will give Its most careful attention to the
Interpretation of Mr. Foote's friendly
tributes, and offers a goodly programme
besides. The soloists will be Dr. S. Schalk
hammer and W. E. Dyer, and there is to
bo an orchestra In addition to the usual
piano and organ accompaniment for the
auspicious occasion.
On Friday evening the second cencert
of the Philharmonic Society will take
place at Metropolitan Temple. Mrs. M.
K. Blanchard will sing and Mr. Mlnettl
has planned an interesting orchestral pro
gramme. \
The fourth free organ recital at Trinity
Church on Thursday evening next by
Louis H. Eaton, organist of the church,
will Include the Wldor fifth symphony,
the Thlele concert-satz in C minor and
some lesser numbers. J. F^Veaco will be
the vocalist andLHother Wismer's violin
will add much to .the Interest of the fine
programme. The attendance at these re
citals is steadily increasing.
The recitals of Mrs. M. E. Blanchard of
Tuesday and Saturday last, under the
auspices of the Channinsr Auxiliary, were
very enjoyable. The charming contralto
was heard in two choice programmes that
included a highly varied and comprehen
sive collection of songs.
It was an exquisite programme and I
doubt that any will forget It who were
privileged to hear. It will not surprise
those who did to learn that Senor Pablo
Casals is a composer of some attainment;
that he has already done much conduct
ing; that he plays the oboe, trombone,
piano and something else besidesâ I for
get what: and regards it as one of his
favorite amusements to play the whole
of 'Tristan and Isolde" In an evening,
ringing meantime all the solos and every
thing else in the gamut of one voice all by
heart. Also that he numbers yet only 25
years, and that he leaves here next week.

shall not look upon again. He haa a
ravishing tone, in its golden deeps like
an organ and again delicate as Ysaye's
violin. He phrases and reads Beethoven
as Bernhardt reads Racine; Interprets
Bach with the same illumined clarity,

with Daly?" I flung Into another sprout^
Ing silence. " . ' . , Â» '
Â¦ "Mr. Daly started, us with The Merry
Wives of Windsor,' and of course thera
was. the 'As You Like It,'" the actor
laconically replied.
I told him here, to some apparent inter
est, of our successful Shakespearean pre
sentations of last season, afterward ask
ing: "What of your modern plays? You
like best The Bauble Shop'?"
"No.- Possibly 'Rosemary,' '* the player
replied, then went on, "You have seen me
in 'Rosemary'?"
"Indeed, yes."
"A beautiful play, a beautiful play!"
"How about Ibsen?"
"Unpleasant, Isn't he?"
"We had Blanche Bates iT^Hedda Gab
ler'' last year and enjoyed it"
"How. did she do?" Mr. Drew inquired.
I told him, and then asked if it were not
rather surprising to find such interest as
was taken in the play so far away from
the "centers of etc." |
"Oh! San Francisco has always count
ed for more than she should," said tha
player, unexpectedly voluble. "You have
only 300.000 peopleâ are there?â and yet
you hear and see almost everything. Wty
should you not know things?"
"Dees New York think we do? Aren't
we classed as very 'woolly* down East?"
"Not at all." Mr. Drew declared. "And
I like San Francisco.. It is* like coming
home to come here. I know so many peo
ple. Did 'you see the house on* Monday
night? Quite touched me. I have been
down at Burlingame (he did not Anglicise
the word) all day. Very pleasant."
Then Mr. Drew looked at me In tho
"make-up" mirror as if slightly aston
ished that he had said so much. Silenca
again threatened, but I was to the forÂ»
in time to save the minute. \
"Some of us feel, Mr. Drewâ thoutja
The Second in Command' is a good pU;A
tltat John Drew should be doing larger
things."
."Where am I to' get them?" he asked.
"Who's writing *em'<? Jones* and Pinero's
last plays have disappointed. Ibsen can
not be popularized."
"What of Shaw?*'
" T.he Devil's Disciple'â have you seen
it?â is a splendid play," and a flash ct
enthusiasm lighted up the heavy-lidded
eyes for a moment. *â¢ $ .
. "Why not Shaw, then?"
"Mansfield has The Devil's Disciple."*
replied the actor. 'Then there is 'Cap-'
tain Brassbound's Conversion* â an excel
lent play. But all of Bernard Shaw's
comeaies require a leading man or woman
for every part. Difficult to get."
"Yes, in these daya of stars,"* I said.
"In Daly's lime '* â¢-.- â¢-â¢â¢
Silence the fifth.
"I like The Second in Command,' how*
ever." volunteered Mr. Drew.
"You make it."
"My companyâ"
â¢"Is ever so well suited to the play and
very adequate." I granted. "You have a
new leading lady ne'xt season. I hear?"
"Yes; Miss Margaret Dale."
"A great favorite with us," I said, and
Mr. Drew here certainly looked pleased.
Then to my questioning he spoke of his
daughter. Miss Louise, now acting with
the company, and showing more than a
little promise in her work. He acknowl
edged also to being a "loyal Philadel
phian" and fellow-townsman of David
Blspbam. and to a predilection for horse
back riding. Then on my taking' leave,
Mr. Drew, still in the "Blnks" staccato,
was good enough to express a half-repret
that he did not interview easily. But 1
am not by any means persuaded that I
have Interviewed John Drew. Blnks is
the person and the joke is on me.
RISING YOUNG MUSICIAN OF
THIS CITY. PHOTOGRAPH BY
MAURER.
THERE, are people who are more
Interesting from the things they
do not do than ' from the things
that have included themselves in
their repertoire as proper to be
done. Off 'the stage John Drew is of the
elect of these, with a capacity for
not 'doing the expected s thing that is
nothing short Â¦- of the phenomenal.
I ' find ' few people unwilling to
discuss j their art, still fewer the fas
cinating subject of .themselves, and 'Mr.
Drew 'Is one of the few. The Interview
seems to suggest itself to the famous
player as one of the inevitable nuisances
of civilization, to be classed with' the dent
ist and the -sewage system, something to
thank God for with a very mitigated
gratitude. Perfectly courteous, he sub
mits to the necessity, but with much the
air of one having his breast to the enemy â
an enemy armed with a pea-shooter, until \
one Is almost as absurdly sorry for him
as one Is for oneself.
There is a deal of Major "Kit" Bing
ham. by the way, about Mr. Drew behind
the scenes, unlessâ base suspicion!â the
actor was Imposing upon my vernal Inno
cence the other day by jestingly continu
ing the performance. He has the same al
most diffidence of manner, the same gift
of silence, the same .military precision of
saying what he does say and the same Im
maculate perfection' of get-up. Not a
hair was out of place on the sleek Drew
head. The tie, trews, shoes and the rest
were, the perfection of elegant unobstru
siveness. So, too, with the Drew manner,
which least of all the professions sug
gests the actor. The only thing that does
obtrude itself in fact is the glittering lack
of all obtrusiveness. Even the dressing
room, where last week Maxlne Ellldtt's
frills and laces reigned supreme, bore the
unmistakable stamp of Its owner's occu
pancy. It" was like a barrack room for
neatness, the Drew orderly putting the
last things to rights with miraculous dis
patch as I went in.,

With quite the "BInks" manner Mr.

" 'Frald I am a very uncommunicative
chap," he said. "Don't like much to talk

about themselves can't be very enjoyable
âeh?' Take a seat.!'
"Thanks. That depends who the fel
low Is," I said, instinctively copying the
Blnks manner. Â¦ Â¦
. "Does it?" he asked.'
I should doubtless have said here, "You
bet your life it does," if dim visions of a
guardhouse had not obtruded 'themselves.
- Nothing -dampened, however, I said,
"Yes, it does depend. Mr. Drew on him

Mr. Drew ' waited comfortably for ma

Certainly one has deserved - something
at the bands of the gods who was privi

Thursday afternoon last at the Musicians'
reception. I do not hope for such another
pure revel of good music as there fell to
my share for many long days to come.
The only pity of It -was that the affair
was cot public, that every one could not
have the chance of hearing one of the
noblest artists that "has ever been heard
here. Senor Casals, it will be remem

making a profound impression at the two
concerts f given by the singer. He was
detained here through a slight accident
to his hand,' and the musicians "of' the
city, determined to hear again one so emi
nently gifted, gave him a reception and
musicale last Thursday. . A programme of
particular appeal to the musician was
chospn, in which were included sonatas
by Beethoven, Bach and Locatelli, with
some jewels of the modern French school
by Saint-Saens, Jean Hure and Gabriel
Faure. Mr. Bendix and Mr. Maurer were
summoned to the piano and the musicians
bidden to the feast.
accompanist's simple instinct serves him,
wherewith every shade of color, every lift
and fall of the tempo, is felt with almost
mathematical nicety. Mr. Maurer has this
faculty to an unusual degree, and only
those who have followed the city's con
cert history for the last two years know
what good work has been done in this di
rection by the young artist. Mr. Maurer' s
effort is distinguished by the keenest sym
pathy, a delicate discretion and robust
judgment that mark it as of the best of Its
Technically, it is etlll a little wanting,
but that will come. Meantime Mr. Maurer
remains among the most valuable mem
bers of the local musical fraternity. He
is very sensibly cultivating the rare art of
accompaniment to its last possibilities,
and seems to have no desire beyond it,
though, so far as the Hyperion locks are
concerned, he is admirably equipped for a
eolo career! But many singers will, per
haps Â¦ selfishly, rejoice at his abstention,
&nd listeners cot a few. I can answer for
one.
AT the- Blanchard recitals of this
week, at the musicians' recep

at the Fisk recitals of a month
or so ago and at many other
musical affairs of the season a conspicu

at the piano will never have v reason to
complain of Indifference on the part -of
the audience. It is only when matters go
as they should, when the accompaniment
sways and ebbs and flows with every pulse
of the singer, that the ingrate listener
â¢'forgets to remember" â as the Japanese
bayâ that his enjoyment is largely owing
to the unobtrusive artist at the piano end
of things.
Accompanists, like poets, are born, not
made. It is a peculiar gift that in its ab
sence can never be quite successfully
counterfeited. It is a sort , of prophetic
Instinct, that telegraphs unerringly to its
owner the intent and musical desire of the
person whom he is supporting. By no
capacity of calculation can -this be real
ized to the marvelous extent to which the
FAMOUS ACTOR WHO IB PLATING
BEFORE LARGE AND FASHION
" ABDE AUDIENCES. ' ./
IS IT PROVIDENTIAL?
In one view of this fear-inspiring calamity good comes out of its awful suffering. "All over
the world pity's sweet fountain is made affluent and the first and highest of the Christian virtues
is quickened, and the spirit of helpfulness and charity is abroad, and food and medicine, clothing
and comfort, freight the swift ships that go to the rescue of the stricken. But again, why need'
innocent Ghildhood perish in the fire and piety die upon bended knee, in order that the millions
far away may be touched to tenderness toward those that suffer?
At the end, as in the beginning, it is a mysteryâ a part, of that riddle held closer, than the
secret of the Sphinx, which no finite eye may read and no man's hand untanerle.
John Wesley in his sermon on the cause and cure of earthquakes said they were caused by
the wickedness of man, and their cure was universal righteousnesl. But if only universal right
eousness will prevent them, and Providence be omnipotent/ why let the many righteous, the vast
majority of the sinless, go on perishing with the few wicked, while waiting for righteous unan
imity? It is not in the understood order of Providence that the innocent shall suffer for
the guilty. Â¦ .
Teleology seeks for a first cause. May not that cause have been the architect of the
physical universe, the source of its unchangeable laws/ the planter of the germ of life which has
flowered in man, -and then have left all things material to act and react upon eacH other?
May it not be concluded, then, that the Providence which rules that empire employs no
physical force in its system of rewards and punishments? May men remain devout, be Christian,
keep the commandments, live by the golden rule, and still be left to their own foresight and re
sources for protection against wind and weather, title and tempest, earthquake and volcano?
When human reason is applied to the appalling riddle may it not differentiate the physical
from the metaphysical, .the material from the spiritual? Napoleon did. that, -He accounted for his
profound decline by saying that he founded a material empire/ for which no man offered himself
in sacrifice after the structure crumbled and its creator was a prisoner. But that the spiritual em
pire, whose founder perished miserably upon Calvary, had been defended by the blood of martyrs
and the consecration of saints in'alla'ges; 2fter ; human f power had jeered at and crucified its
head. The conqueror of kingdoms affirmed this as evidence of the presence of "spiritual power
that ruled an ineffable empire with no relation to material things.
It is the devout belief of the world that a kind and watchful Providence presides over what
we call the manifestations of nature. Men implore that power to send the early and the latter
rain. Men are called to righteousness by the promise of reward and they are driven from wick
edness by the fear of punishment. . V
It is a great mystery. Why did the righteous perish by tens of thousands, and one wicked,
a murderer, pass through that furnace alive and untouched by fire?
But this was also in punishment for wickedness that only fire could purge and cleanse.
There is no known evidence that the cities of the islands were wicked. The rain of fire and brim
stone fell upon St. Pierre in the early morning of a solemn Christian festival. It was Ascension
day, hallowed by all believers of every creed. / The great cathedral was crowded by devout wor
shipers. At every altar and shrine in the doomed city and in every home, the thoughts of the
people were upon that scene, when "He led them out as far as Bethany, and hevjifted up his hands
and blessed them, and it came to pass, while he. blessed them, he was parted from them and car
ried up into heaven.". Just as thousands of men and women and innocent children felt the impress
of that blessing, fire and brimstone, smothering Jiot ashes and. deadly fumes fell upon them from
the heavens and they perished awfully. The temples blazed in the consuming heat, and the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke from a furnace. :
Of all the thousands living but a moment before, in that fajthfur city, only one lived after
the tempest of flame had passed. When searchers went into the midst of that appalling scene of
death and desolation they found in a. stone cell of the jail, alive and unhurt, a negro murderer,
chained to the wall where he awaited the execution of the death sentence* of the - law. When're
leased he rose and fled. Lot, the righteous man, was saved out of Sodom. A murderer was saved
ojit of St. Pierre. â¢ â¢ . , .
Earlier than this destruction of Korah, Sodom and Gomorrah /were consumed by fire. After
the faithful Lot had been warned to flee, the account of the catastrophe given in Genesis might,
with but little paraphrase, be read as the awful story of St. Pierre: "And the sun wa^s. risen upon
the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities and all the plain,
and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground; And Abraham gat up
in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord, and he looked toward Sodom and
Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo! the smoke! of the country went
up as the smoke of a furnace." â¢ , '
eF old such events as the ; overwhelming v of thousands in .Martinique â¢ and St. Vincent
were traced -to direct, ''intelligent;. and; intended action' of Providence. They were
attributed to a spirit of admonition for the warning :of : the' wicked and a purpose
to destroy Jor hardness of theart. When Korati and his company were destroyed it
is writtenthat Moses.said: "If these men. die the common death .' of '. all men, or if they be visited
affer visitation of all men, then the Lx>rd hath not sent me. But i( the Lord make a new thing,
arid the earth opencth her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain to them, and they
Â£0 down quick into the .pit, then ye shall understand that these men ; have provoked the Lord;
And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up anc\ their houses.;; They and all that
appertained unto them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them, and they
perished from amongst the congregation, artel there came out a fire frbmHhe Lord and consumed
the twohundred and fifty men that offered incense." / Â¦Â¦-â¢â¢; Â¦ }."Â¦>:'.' .
But this was punishment of Korah and his company for complaining that Moses took too.
much to himself and set himself above the congregation. â¢ â¢Â¦'Â¦

imposing ceremonies the re
mains of Major General Wil
liam Starke Rosecrans to
day were re4ntÂ«*rred in Arling
ton Cemetery, under the direction of'the
Society of the Army of the Cumberland.
The services wero presided over by Gen
eralVDavld B. Henderson, Speaker of the
I'ouse of Representatives. President'
Roosevelt, members of his Cabinet, Sen
j atom and Representatives and a host of
friends, including many of his old army
associates, were present to pay their last
tribute to the noted soldier.
Full military honors were accorded the
remain*, which were borne to the grave
on a caisson. The funeral cortege moved
from tho Arlington Hotel at 10 o'clock,
and tho escort was commanded by Lieu

Speaker Henderson, who presided, dellv
cied an addre**. He said In part:
PKAISE FROM HENDERSON.,
IVw generals of the Civil War had a
stronger hold upon the officers and men who
fought under his command. They respected,
they loved him. and that love is attested by
this act of yours In bringing the body of your
oM commander from the Golden Oatc to lay
him away In your midst In this sacred and .his
toric .city of the dead. In every position held
by General Rosecrans his noble character was
mer.lfcst. General Rorecrans, sleep peacefully
in the. bosom of tho country you fought hero-
Irfclly to save. You have earned a rest In her
boecra, but General Rosecrans, no single grave
can hold you, for you will be , burled In the
hearts of all the soldiers who fought under
your command and In tbe hearts of an appro
cletlve, grateful, loving; country. . -
At the conclusion of Speaker Hender
iÂ«on's remark!) the quartet choir of St.
Pa trick's Catholic Church sang "Lead,
Kindly. Light," after which addresses
vere made^by President Roosevelt, Sen
ator Foraker- and Representatives Hep

dent spoke as follows:
Mr. -Speaker and you, the comrade* 'of the
great chief whose reburlal in Â¦ the National
Cemetery here at Arlington we have met to
gether to .commemorate. .'â¢ Â¦ . â¢;
The Speaker In his address has well said that
the builder rather than the destroyer Is tho
man most entitled to honor among us; that the
man who builds up Is greater than ho who
tears down and that our honor must be In a
â¢fighting man who not only fought worthily, but
fought In a worthy cause. And therefore for all.
tlmq not only the people of this great reunited
country, bub the nations of mankind, who' see
the - hop* â¢ tor ordered liberty in what j this
country has done â they will forever hold you,
the men of the great Civil War, and the lead
ers like him whose immortal remains are to be
put to-day In their final resting-place, in a pe
culiar honor, because .you were soldiers who
fought to build: you were uifbullders; you were
the men to whose lot it fell to save the perpetu
ity, to make strong the national fabric, the
foundations of which had been laid by the men
who fought under' the man . whose horn* at
Mount Vernon stands as an equally prized mem
ory of the past with Arlington. Â¦ Â¦ - , >
WORTH OF ROSECRANS.
It is no 'chance that has made Mount Vernon
and Arlington hrre In the neighborhood of
"Washington the 'two great â¢ memorials of a na
tion's past, because one '.commemorates the
.founding and the other the saving of the.na
tion. If It were not for wTiat Arlington sym
bolizes, Mount Vernon would be little or noth
ing: if It were not for what was done by Hone
crans and his fellows, the work. of Washington
would have crumbled into bloody chaos and the
.'deeds of the founders of thls'republlc would be
remembered only because they had been another
of the many failures of the spirit of liberty, In 1

nothing else, devoted to the Union and to

R0Q3EVELT PAYS HOMAGE.
Tou left un another lesson In brotherhood.
To-i!ay you come here, comrades of the Army
of. the Cumberland, the man who had a com
million, the man who fought. In the ranks,
brothers because Â¦ each did what there was in
him to do for the right: rach did what he could
and all alike share equally In the glory of the
deed that was done. Officer and enlisted man
stend at the bar of history -to be Judged, not
by the difference In ranks, but by whether they
did their duties to the respective ranks. < Ap
plause.t And of- how- little -account, - looking
back, the difference of rank is compared with
tbe doing of duty, and what was true then Is
true now. The doing the duty welt Is what
counts. ' . Â¦
the men who fought to a successful close the
revolution would have meant nothing. To you
It Tva* given to do the great work which If
left undone would have meant that all else
done -by our people would have counted' for
nothing. You left us a reunited country and
therefore the right, the brotherhood, with an
all-pride In the gallantry and self-devotion of
thosx who wure the gray and were pitted
against us In the great struggle. The very fact
that we appreciate more and more as tho years
g3 o:i the Importance to this country and to
mankind of your victory- makes It mora and
more possible for us to recognize In the heart
lÂ»*t and the frankest manner the sincerity,
the self-devotion and the fealty to the right
as It was 'given them to see the right of our
fellow-Americans against whom you fought.
And now thÂ» reunion is so complete that It Is
usMese to allud* to the fact that it Is conv
pletÂ». (Applause.) .
The service* at tho pavilion over, the
cortege moved slowly to the grave, where
the commitment .xervice was read by Dr.
Stafford, closing with "Nearer. My God.
to Thee" by the quartet. Taps were
sounded, followed by. a salvo of artillery,
and the last rites over the distinguished
soldier had been performed.
To do the work necessary, whatever that
work may be, to make good the work that you
did, to 'acknowledge the Inspiration of your
careers In war and in peace and to remind
ourselves once for all that lip loyalty Is not
the "loyalty that counts: that loyalty that
counts Is the loyalty that shows Itself In deeds
rather than In words:' therefore we. pledge our
selves to mske good by our lives what you
risked your lives to gain and keep for. the na
tion as a whole. <areat applause.)
And here In the presence of one of the Illus
trious dead whos* name will remain forever
more on the honor roll of the greatest republic
on which the nun has ever shown, here In
that credence It behooves all of ux, old and
young, aotemnly and reverentlji to pledge our
selven to continue undlmmed the traditions ,you
left us.
There are those of whom I have spoken who
have addressed or who will address you to-day.
They arc entitled to speak an comrades of the
great dead. We, the younger* of -.u*. are en
titled to pay to the zreat dead thÂ« homage of
tb*fte to whom ordered liberty baa been handed
clown aa a heritage because of the blood and
the sweat and toll of the men who fought to a
nnlxh the great Civil War. You taught us In
war. Great have been the lessons you have
taught us In peace since. the war. Reverently
and humbly the men who came after you. has
tened to acknowledge the debt that is owing to
you. Tou were the men of the mighty days
who showed youmelves equal to the day. We
have to-day lÂ«&Â«er tasks, but shame to us if
we flinch from doing or fall to do well the
lerser tasks where you carried to triumphant
victory a feat as difficult as that which wax
set. you.
The size of the appropriation already
made, it is believed, renders, consideration
cf the Panama canal route absolutely out
of the question. Should that route be
adopted by Congress, which is a very re-,
n:ote possibility, It would mean a direct
appropriation for the citizens of, France
ot $40,000,000. Such an appropriation would
be' utterly -out of tho question.' Thus,
v/hlle unchecked extravagance is likely
to militate against the Nicaragua bill to
a certain extent, it will make the rejec
tion of the Panama route an absolute cer
tainty.
four yearÂ» or three years' tervic* with â¢ the
colors. -Â¦ - â¢. â¢ .
If the Nicaragua canal bill passes it wilt
authorize an expenditure of $180,000,600,
but It }s doubiful if more than $l0,00<),00Q
will be appropriated at the outset. This
amount could doubtless be provided for
in some way, and there would certainly
be no difficulty in getting that amount if
the President' should veto the rivers and
harbors bill. That this bill may be vetoed
on the ground of unprecedented jobbery
Is being anxiously discussed by the
statesmen.
In view of the fact that the appropria
tions-are apt to aggregate a billion dol
lars and create a deficit before the ex
piration of the next fiscal year, -the ques
tion arises, "What is to become of the
lsthmlaji canal?" The exhaustion of the
Tublic resources In advance, of the canal
bills afford enemies of' the canal a -new
ambush behind' which to light. They can
now assert that it will- be Impracticable
to authorize the canal because there Is
rot money enough. Indeed,- there are
some who say that this was the deliberate
purpose the Congressional leaders had in
view when they lopped off all the war
taxes.
The rivers and harbors , bill, when It
passed the House, had grown, through a
log-rolling combination, to $60,000,000. A
similar union of forces in the Senate add
ed $10,000,000 to it. There are enough meas
ures now pending in the two houses to
swell the appropriations for this session
at least $1,000,000 beyond the billion-dollar
mark. The omnibus claims bill, aggregat
ing millions, and increases . In salary- for
practically everybody in the public serv
ice t and a public building bill make up
$05.000.000.... > .
The members of the committees on ap
propriation in the House and Senate clear
ly let the situation get away from them
early In the session. The raid that had
been made upon the treasury has been too
flerce for them to resist, yet it is doubt
ful if either Representative Cannon or
Senator Allison realized the record they
were making for, profligacy till the facts
were told. . . . ; .. â¢ "

bo able to express my everlasting- gratitude to
you for the great benefit received from the. use
of Kemp'* fiupponltorleii. For years I t*u(Tercd
every torture. Was treated by five different
physicians, but only failed and grew worse.
Discouraged. I tried three -remedies for female
complaints without relief, and after 'having
mertyred almost - everything, . reluctlantly sub-
mitted to an operation which - seemed- to
paralyse me partially, as a result of which I
wni confined to bed for three months. Almost
on the verge of . despair I was .induced to try
Keir.p'a Suppositories. T was. naturally ekep-
tlcal about any thins; helping me, but after the
first month the change In my condition was
marvelous. â¢ . â¢- y.-i. Â¦ > v Â¦ ~ ,
Now, after six months' use: of the Suppos-
itories, I feel a different woman. I gladly tell
this and would cheerfully recommend the rem-
edy to nil suffering as 1 did. All who do 1 ac-
cording to directions will agree with me. that
life is not such a failure after all.. , Â¦ ,

mains of Major General Wil
liam Starke Rosecrans to
day were re4ntÂ«*rred in Arling
ton Cemetery, under the direction of'the
Society of the Army of the Cumberland.
The services wero presided over by Gen
eralVDavld B. Henderson, Speaker of the
I'ouse of Representatives. President'
Roosevelt, members of his Cabinet, Sen
j atom and Representatives and a host of
friends, including many of his old army
associates, were present to pay their last

Full military honors were accorded the

Speaker Henderson, who presided, dellv
cied an addre**. He said In part:
PKAISE FROM HENDERSON.,
IVw generals of the Civil War had a
stronger hold upon the officers and men who
fought under his command. They respected,
they loved him. and that love is attested by
this act of yours In bringing the body of your
oM commander from the Golden Oatc to lay
him away In your midst In this sacred and .his
toric .city of the dead. In every position held
by General Rosecrans his noble character was
mer.lfcst. General Rorecrans, sleep peacefully
in the. bosom of tho country you fought hero-
Irfclly to save. You have earned a rest In her
boecra, but General Rosecrans, no single grave
can hold you, for you will be , burled In the
hearts of all the soldiers who fought under
your command and In tbe hearts of an appro
cletlve, grateful, loving; country. . -
At the conclusion of Speaker Hender
iÂ«on's remark!) the quartet choir of St.
Pa trick's Catholic Church sang "Lead,
Kindly. Light," after which addresses
vere made^by President Roosevelt, Sen
ator Foraker- and Representatives Hep

dent spoke as follows:
Mr. -Speaker and you, the comrade* 'of the
great chief whose reburlal in Â¦ the National
Cemetery here at Arlington we have met to
gether to .commemorate. .'â¢ Â¦ . â¢;
The Speaker In his address has well said that
the builder rather than the destroyer Is tho
man most entitled to honor among us; that the
man who builds up Is greater than ho who
tears down and that our honor must be In a
â¢fighting man who not only fought worthily, but
fought In a worthy cause. And therefore for all.
tlmq not only the people of this great reunited
country, bub the nations of mankind, who' see
the - hop* â¢ tor ordered liberty in what j this
country has done â they will forever hold you,
the men of the great Civil War, and the lead
ers like him whose immortal remains are to be
put to-day In their final resting-place, in a pe
culiar honor, because .you were soldiers who
fought to build: you were uifbullders; you were
the men to whose lot it fell to save the perpetu
ity, to make strong the national fabric, the
foundations of which had been laid by the men
who fought under' the man . whose horn* at
Mount Vernon stands as an equally prized mem
ory of the past with Arlington. Â¦ Â¦ - , >
WORTH OF ROSECRANS.
It is no 'chance that has made Mount Vernon
and Arlington hrre In the neighborhood of
"Washington the 'two great â¢ memorials of a na
tion's past, because one '.commemorates the
.founding and the other the saving of the.na
tion. If It were not for wTiat Arlington sym
bolizes, Mount Vernon would be little or noth
ing: if It were not for what was done by Hone
crans and his fellows, the work. of Washington
would have crumbled into bloody chaos and the
.'deeds of the founders of thls'republlc would be
remembered only because they had been another
of the many failures of the spirit of liberty, In 1
this country. ' â¢* â¢ . Â¦ â¢

In the presence of tbonÂ« who fought through

I should not try. to eulogize . the ', dead gen
eral In the presence of his comrades. In the
presence of his fellow-men who have come to
honor the . memory of the man agalnut whom
they were pitted In the past and who come here
because they now. like us, are Americans nad
nothing else, devoted to the Union and to
on? caus*. (Applause.)
R0Q3EVELT PAYS HOMAGE.
Tou left un another lesson In brotherhood.
To-i!ay you come here, comrades of the Army
of. the Cumberland, the man who had a com
million, the man who fought. In the ranks,
brothers because Â¦ each did what there was in
him to do for the right: rach did what he could
and all alike share equally In the glory of the
deed that was done. Officer and enlisted man
stend at the bar of history -to be Judged, not
by the difference In ranks, but by whether they
did their duties to the respective ranks. < Ap
plause.t And of- how- little -account, - looking
back, the difference of rank is compared with
tbe doing of duty, and what was true then Is
true now. The doing the duty welt Is what
counts. ' . Â¦
the men who fought to a successful close the
revolution would have meant nothing. To you
It Tva* given to do the great work which If
left undone would have meant that all else
done -by our people would have counted' for
nothing. You left us a reunited country and
therefore the right, the brotherhood, with an
all-pride In the gallantry and self-devotion of
thosx who wure the gray and were pitted
against us In the great struggle. The very fact
that we appreciate more and more as tho years
g3 o:i the Importance to this country and to
mankind of your victory- makes It mora and
more possible for us to recognize In the heart
lÂ»*t and the frankest manner the sincerity,
the self-devotion and the fealty to the right
as It was 'given them to see the right of our
fellow-Americans against whom you fought.
And now thÂ» reunion is so complete that It Is
usMese to allud* to the fact that it Is conv
pletÂ». (Applause.) .
The service* at tho pavilion over, the
cortege moved slowly to the grave, where
the commitment .xervice was read by Dr.
Stafford, closing with "Nearer. My God.
to Thee" by the quartet. Taps were
sounded, followed by. a salvo of artillery,
and the last rites over the distinguished
soldier had been performed.
To do the work necessary, whatever that
work may be, to make good the work that you
did, to 'acknowledge the Inspiration of your
careers In war and in peace and to remind
ourselves once for all that lip loyalty Is not
the "loyalty that counts: that loyalty that
counts Is the loyalty that shows Itself In deeds
rather than In words:' therefore we. pledge our
selves to mske good by our lives what you
risked your lives to gain and keep for. the na
tion as a whole. <areat applause.)
And here In the presence of one of the Illus
trious dead whos* name will remain forever
more on the honor roll of the greatest republic
on which the nun has ever shown, here In
that credence It behooves all of ux, old and
young, aotemnly and reverentlji to pledge our
selven to continue undlmmed the traditions ,you
left us.
There are those of whom I have spoken who
have addressed or who will address you to-day.
They arc entitled to speak an comrades of the
great dead. We, the younger* of -.u*. are en
titled to pay to the zreat dead thÂ« homage of
tb*fte to whom ordered liberty baa been handed
clown aa a heritage because of the blood and
the sweat and toll of the men who fought to a
nnlxh the great Civil War. You taught us In
war. Great have been the lessons you have
taught us In peace since. the war. Reverently
and humbly the men who came after you. has
tened to acknowledge the debt that is owing to
you. Tou were the men of the mighty days
who showed youmelves equal to the day. We
have to-day lÂ«&Â«er tasks, but shame to us if
we flinch from doing or fall to do well the
lerser tasks where you carried to triumphant
victory a feat as difficult as that which wax
set. you.

n:ote possibility, It would mean a direct
appropriation for the citizens of, France
ot $40,000,000. Such an appropriation would
be' utterly -out of tho question.' Thus,
v/hlle unchecked extravagance is likely
to militate against the Nicaragua bill to
a certain extent, it will make the rejec
tion of the Panama route an absolute cer
tainty.
four yearÂ» or three years' tervic* with â¢ the
colors. -Â¦ - â¢. â¢ .
If the Nicaragua canal bill passes it wilt
authorize an expenditure of $180,000,600,
but It }s doubiful if more than $l0,00<),00Q
will be appropriated at the outset. This
amount could doubtless be provided for
in some way, and there would certainly
be no difficulty in getting that amount if
the President' should veto the rivers and
harbors bill. That this bill may be vetoed
on the ground of unprecedented jobbery
Is being anxiously discussed by the
statesmen.
In view of the fact that the appropria
tions-are apt to aggregate a billion dol
lars and create a deficit before the ex
piration of the next fiscal year, -the ques
tion arises, "What is to become of the
lsthmlaji canal?" The exhaustion of the
Tublic resources In advance, of the canal
bills afford enemies of' the canal a -new
ambush behind' which to light. They can
now assert that it will- be Impracticable
to authorize the canal because there Is
rot money enough. Indeed,- there are
some who say that this was the deliberate
purpose the Congressional leaders had in
view when they lopped off all the war
taxes.
The rivers and harbors , bill, when It
passed the House, had grown, through a
log-rolling combination, to $60,000,000. A
similar union of forces in the Senate add
ed $10,000,000 to it. There are enough meas
ures now pending in the two houses to
swell the appropriations for this session
at least $1,000,000 beyond the billion-dollar
mark. The omnibus claims bill, aggregat
ing millions, and increases . In salary- for
practically everybody in the public serv
ice t and a public building bill make up
$05.000.000.... > .
The members of the committees on ap
propriation in the House and Senate clear
ly let the situation get away from them
early In the session. The raid that had
been made upon the treasury has been too
flerce for them to resist, yet it is doubt
ful if either Representative Cannon or
Senator Allison realized the record they
were making for, profligacy till the facts
were told. . . . ; .. â¢ "
CALL BUREAU, 140ff G ;STREET, N.'
W.; WASHINGTON. May 17.â The state
ment t, that Congressional extravagance
might make this a "billion dollar" session
caused considerable discussion at the;Cap
itol to-day.' There are usually two ses
sions to each Congress. . If j the first bev
sion Is to cost a billion dollars, the second
may be expected, to .cost as much. This
would make the Fifty-seventh Congress
a. "two-billion dollar Congress," a thing
unheard of even in time of war. ....

FOLSOM. May 17.-A flairs In the State
prison here are in a 'demoralized condi
tion. It Is charged that favored convicts
are In practical control of the Institution,
and that discipline Is a thing of the past.
Officials of the : prison are . In constant
fear of convicts who have the ear of War
den Wilkinson. ' They allege that : If the
prison attaches dare to assert their au
thority they aro brought before the War
den and censured. The attaches go even
further, and make the plain accusation
that several efficient employes have been
discharged because they reported favored
convicts for : Infractions or prison ' rules.'
It is said that the rank and tile of con
victs do not receive enough food to keep
body and soul together, while the favored
few fare better than the employes. To
sum up, the subordinates at the prison
declare that the Institution is . managed
not by Warden Wilkinson, but by a hand
ful of criminals, who, while supposedly
undergoing punishment for Infractions of
the lawn, are In reality living In luxury
at- the State's expense, with prison at

The Murder May Cause
Reopening of Tonto
, Basin Range War.
Special DLspntch to The Call.
PHOENIX.- Ariz., May 17.â Word wu
received hero to-day from Tonto Basin
that a Mexican Â«heepherder named Go"
zales had on Thursday shot and killed
Rancher Packard. The murderer fled,
end at last accounts the officers had
found no trace of him.
Packard approached the shepherd's
camp, where several Mexicans are em
ployed,' and ordered them to move on.
Gonzalcs, without a* word, shot Packard
dead. The rancher's body was found later
by a cattleman named Charles Edwards.
The f>heep be'ng herded by. the Mexicans
belong to -ft. L. Longman of Mesa City.
This murder may reopen warfore on
the rans^s. For a quarter of a century
there has l-ten enmity between the cat
tlemen of tnat scctljn and! theshoopmen
of the northern part of the Territory, who,
the' forpttr', allerje Infringe npm tr.eir
ringe. I'iftten years ago this bitterness
culminated In tho Tonto Basin war. In
which many ; were killed. Since then
everything has been peaceable, except
that the cattlemen object to the sheep
men driving their flocks across. the Tonto
country to this valley in the winter and
back in. the spring. There has always
been fear of an outbreak, and It may
now be. precipitated, though it Is not
charged that in Thursday's affair the
Mexican acted on other than his own
murderous impulse. '

George D. Wo ru wick said to-day that he
was confident of being elected. He de
clared the people were ready .for a
change, and he believed they would elect
the entire Citizens' ticket. He places his
probable majority at about 1000.
Adolph Grecnlngcr Is just as confident
of victory for himself and his colleagues
on the ticket. He makes no estimate,
other than to say that he Is certain of a*
good majority. He declares he will give
the people a business administration.
Betting was lively all day on the re
sult of the election. It Is even money and
take your choice.
James W. Rea. the well known poli
tician, says Worswlck will be elected
Mayor by 1000 votes. For years Rea was
"boss" of San Jose.' Mackenzie succeed
ed him, and now Rea Is after the Harbor
Commissioner's scalp. He has lined up his
forces, and they aro taking the Citizens'
ticket straight to avenge their leader.
Citizens' ticketâ Mayor, George D.
Worswlck: Treasurer, W. F. Blakeslte:
Clerk, J. W. Cook; Councllmenâ At large,
H. D. Mathews; First Ward. Patrick
Murray: Fourth Ward, Al I;. Hubbard.
Regular Republican ticket â Mayor,
Adolph Greeninger: Treasurer. T. J. Mc-
Geoghegan; Clerk, J. "W. Cook; Council
menâAt large. W. O. Rogers; First Ward,
J. F. O'Keefo: Fourth Ward. W. II.
Anderson.
The two tickets are as follows:
The Worswlck meeting at the Audi-'
torium last night, which was the biggest
political gathering ever held In San Jose,
nas set the mass of voters guessing.
Worswlck men claim It Is a certain sign
of a landslide. No other officialâ city or
countyâ has ever drawn such a crowd.
The reformers are jubilant over the show
ing, and predict the defeat of Mackenzie.
Worswlck has made a much better cum
pilgn than Greeninger. In efficiency wilh
the "glad hand," no one In San Jose can
excel the Citizens' nominee. Practically
unknown two months ago, Worswick's
name is on the tongue of half thÂ«Â» people
of San Jose to-day. From surface indi
cations he appears to have a walkover lor
tne mayoralty, but against this must be
counted the quiet, etiective work of John
D. Mackenzie and his followers.
The present campaign is the most mixed
In the history of the city. Just where and
how some of the factions stand is a mys
tery. The old soldiers, who have always
been a factor in local elections, are di
vided, and there have been changes of
political faith among minor politicians.
In the reform element, which is under
the direction of E. A. Huyes, are lined up
the Republican Good Government forces,
the reform Democrats and a large follow
ing of citizens. A new factor in the Hayes
camp is the Independence Cluo, an asso
ciation organized during the campaign.
It has a large membership, and has been
an aggressive element. This force is thor
oughly organized, and will make a hard
light for votes at the polls.
Adolph Greeninger, the nominee for
Mayor of the Mackenzie faction, has
,beon a resident of San Jose for more than
thirty years. He held the office of Su
pervisor a number of years, and is one of
ihe best known men In the city. He is
relying on his record as a county official
to bring him many votes. The Macken
zie machine is back of him. The Harbor
Commissioner has a strong organization,
and has never met defeat in a city elec
tion. When he quit his place as Rea's
lieutenant Mackenzie took most of the
so-called "gang" vote with him. He con
trols all the city departments, and It is
from the employes of the police and fire
departments that his strongest workers
come. Kor the last two days they have
been lining up voters, and because of
their quiet way of working it is im
possible for an outsider to estimate their
exact strength.
SAN JOSE, May 17.â San Jose voters are
anxious for Monday's fight at the polls,
For two weeks the campaign has beer
at a white heat.' To-day and this evening
the principal street corners were almost
impassable, crowds of citizens standing
and listening to the harangues of politi
cians. Both factions are confident of vic
tory, but neither will give up the struggle
until the votes are counted and the result
announced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"For three days we searched the hills,
but not a trace of the man could we dis
cover, though we well knew that some
where within a radius of twenty or thirty
miles lay the body of one of the bravest
men that ever lost Ms 'life in that creat
death-trapâ the Colorado desert."
"We were out on the desert prospecting
for gold," said Fay. "An Indian whom
we had employed to show us where to
ttnd water on the desert caught his foot
in the stirrup while mounting his horse
and fell on his back. The horse started
to run, dragging the Indian by one toot.
As the grouna was covered by jagged
rocks, the Indian would have been Killed
had not Aaams run up and seized tne
horse by the bit. The animal, wild with
fright, reared and plunged. Adams was
twice thrown upon the rocks and once
the horse's hoof struck him, but he rtiU
gripped the bit until Mr. Lamere and I
succeeded in releasing the Indian.
"After all the danger was over, Adams
sat down upon a rock and began laugh
ing, and when asked if he was hurt, re
plied: 'Oh, no; I'm only a little tired,
out 1 guess you will have to help me set
this arm.' We then started for Yuma,
Adams riding some twenty-live miles that
afternoon and never once complaining,
though we could see by his drawn
features that he was suffering intense
pain. Â¦Â»
f'At dusk we camped for the night and
within an hour the sick man was de
lirious and raving like a maniac. Seme
time during the night he left camp. As
soon as we discovered that he had gone
we made every effort to tind him, but
could not do much until daylight, when
we found his tracks in the sand. We fol
lowed the tracks all that day and until
about 9 o'clock the next ' day. when we
came to a hard, rocky place at the foot
of some rock hills. Here we lost the
trail, and try as we might, we could not
Jind it again.
SAN BERNARDINO, May 17.-J. P.
Fay returned to-day from a a trlp across
the Colorado with news of theÂ«death of
J. A. Adams, Deputy County Surveyor of
San Bernardino County and a grand&on
of John Brown, the abolitionist of na
tional fame. Adams met with a horrible
death, wandering away from the survey-
Ing camp while temporarily deranged and

FOLSOM. May 17.-A flairs In the State
prison here are in a 'demoralized condi
tion. It Is charged that favored convicts
are In practical control of the Institution,
and that discipline Is a thing of the past.
Officials of the : prison are . In constant
fear of convicts who have the ear of War
den Wilkinson. ' They allege that : If the
prison attaches dare to assert their au
thority they aro brought before the War
den and censured. The attaches go even
further, and make the plain accusation
that several efficient employes have been
discharged because they reported favored
convicts for : Infractions or prison ' rules.'
It is said that the rank and tile of con
victs do not receive enough food to keep
body and soul together, while the favored
few fare better than the employes. To
sum up, the subordinates at the prison
declare that the Institution is . managed
not by Warden Wilkinson, but by a hand
ful of criminals, who, while supposedly
undergoing punishment for Infractions of
the lawn, are In reality living In luxury
at- the State's expense, with prison at
taches for their servants. V .

The Murder May Cause
Reopening of Tonto
, Basin Range War.
Special DLspntch to The Call.
PHOENIX.- Ariz., May 17.â Word wu
received hero to-day from Tonto Basin
that a Mexican Â«heepherder named Go"
zales had on Thursday shot and killed
Rancher Packard. The murderer fled,
end at last accounts the officers had
found no trace of him.
Packard approached the shepherd's
camp, where several Mexicans are em
ployed,' and ordered them to move on.
Gonzalcs, without a* word, shot Packard
dead. The rancher's body was found later
by a cattleman named Charles Edwards.
The f>heep be'ng herded by. the Mexicans
belong to -ft. L. Longman of Mesa City.
This murder may reopen warfore on
the rans^s. For a quarter of a century
there has l-ten enmity between the cat
tlemen of tnat scctljn and! theshoopmen
of the northern part of the Territory, who,
the' forpttr', allerje Infringe npm tr.eir
ringe. I'iftten years ago this bitterness
culminated In tho Tonto Basin war. In
which many ; were killed. Since then
everything has been peaceable, except
that the cattlemen object to the sheep
men driving their flocks across. the Tonto
country to this valley in the winter and
back in. the spring. There has always
been fear of an outbreak, and It may
now be. precipitated, though it Is not
charged that in Thursday's affair the
Mexican acted on other than his own
murderous impulse. '

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
George D. Wo ru wick said to-day that he
was confident of being elected. He de
clared the people were ready .for a
change, and he believed they would elect
the entire Citizens' ticket. He places his
probable majority at about 1000.
Adolph Grecnlngcr Is just as confident
of victory for himself and his colleagues
on the ticket. He makes no estimate,
other than to say that he Is certain of a*
good majority. He declares he will give
the people a business administration.
Betting was lively all day on the re
sult of the election. It Is even money and
take your choice.
James W. Rea. the well known poli
tician, says Worswlck will be elected
Mayor by 1000 votes. For years Rea was
"boss" of San Jose.' Mackenzie succeed
ed him, and now Rea Is after the Harbor
Commissioner's scalp. He has lined up his
forces, and they aro taking the Citizens'
ticket straight to avenge their leader.
Citizens' ticketâ Mayor, George D.
Worswlck: Treasurer, W. F. Blakeslte:
Clerk, J. W. Cook; Councllmenâ At large,
H. D. Mathews; First Ward. Patrick
Murray: Fourth Ward, Al I;. Hubbard.
Regular Republican ticket â Mayor,
Adolph Greeninger: Treasurer. T. J. Mc-
Geoghegan; Clerk, J. "W. Cook; Council
menâAt large. W. O. Rogers; First Ward,
J. F. O'Keefo: Fourth Ward. W. II.
Anderson.
The two tickets are as follows:
The Worswlck meeting at the Audi-'
torium last night, which was the biggest
political gathering ever held In San Jose,
nas set the mass of voters guessing.
Worswlck men claim It Is a certain sign
of a landslide. No other officialâ city or
countyâ has ever drawn such a crowd.
The reformers are jubilant over the show
ing, and predict the defeat of Mackenzie.
Worswlck has made a much better cum
pilgn than Greeninger. In efficiency wilh
the "glad hand," no one In San Jose can
excel the Citizens' nominee. Practically
unknown two months ago, Worswick's
name is on the tongue of half thÂ«Â» people
of San Jose to-day. From surface indi
cations he appears to have a walkover lor
tne mayoralty, but against this must be
counted the quiet, etiective work of John
D. Mackenzie and his followers.
The present campaign is the most mixed
In the history of the city. Just where and
how some of the factions stand is a mys
tery. The old soldiers, who have always
been a factor in local elections, are di
vided, and there have been changes of
political faith among minor politicians.
In the reform element, which is under
the direction of E. A. Huyes, are lined up
the Republican Good Government forces,
the reform Democrats and a large follow
ing of citizens. A new factor in the Hayes
camp is the Independence Cluo, an asso
ciation organized during the campaign.
It has a large membership, and has been
an aggressive element. This force is thor
oughly organized, and will make a hard
light for votes at the polls.
Adolph Greeninger, the nominee for
Mayor of the Mackenzie faction, has
,beon a resident of San Jose for more than
thirty years. He held the office of Su
pervisor a number of years, and is one of
ihe best known men In the city. He is
relying on his record as a county official
to bring him many votes. The Macken
zie machine is back of him. The Harbor
Commissioner has a strong organization,
and has never met defeat in a city elec
tion. When he quit his place as Rea's
lieutenant Mackenzie took most of the
so-called "gang" vote with him. He con
trols all the city departments, and It is
from the employes of the police and fire
departments that his strongest workers
come. Kor the last two days they have
been lining up voters, and because of
their quiet way of working it is im
possible for an outsider to estimate their
exact strength.
SAN JOSE, May 17.â San Jose voters are
anxious for Monday's fight at the polls,
For two weeks the campaign has beer
at a white heat.' To-day and this evening
the principal street corners were almost
impassable, crowds of citizens standing
and listening to the harangues of politi
cians. Both factions are confident of vic
tory, but neither will give up the struggle
until the votes are counted and the result
announced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"For three days we searched the hills,
but not a trace of the man could we dis
cover, though we well knew that some
where within a radius of twenty or thirty
miles lay the body of one of the bravest
men that ever lost Ms 'life in that creat
death-trapâ the Colorado desert."
"We were out on the desert prospecting
for gold," said Fay. "An Indian whom
we had employed to show us where to
ttnd water on the desert caught his foot
in the stirrup while mounting his horse
and fell on his back. The horse started
to run, dragging the Indian by one toot.
As the grouna was covered by jagged
rocks, the Indian would have been Killed
had not Aaams run up and seized tne
horse by the bit. The animal, wild with
fright, reared and plunged. Adams was
twice thrown upon the rocks and once
the horse's hoof struck him, but he rtiU
gripped the bit until Mr. Lamere and I
succeeded in releasing the Indian.
"After all the danger was over, Adams
sat down upon a rock and began laugh
ing, and when asked if he was hurt, re
plied: 'Oh, no; I'm only a little tired,
out 1 guess you will have to help me set
this arm.' We then started for Yuma,
Adams riding some twenty-live miles that
afternoon and never once complaining,
though we could see by his drawn
features that he was suffering intense
pain. Â¦Â»
f'At dusk we camped for the night and
within an hour the sick man was de
lirious and raving like a maniac. Seme
time during the night he left camp. As
soon as we discovered that he had gone
we made every effort to tind him, but
could not do much until daylight, when
we found his tracks in the sand. We fol
lowed the tracks all that day and until
about 9 o'clock the next ' day. when we
came to a hard, rocky place at the foot
of some rock hills. Here we lost the
trail, and try as we might, we could not

FAT VS. BRAINS.
Food That Makes Brilliant. News-

Nervous prostration cannot continue If
the right kind of food Is ueed, but food
that will build fat does not always con-
tain the elements necessary for rebuilding
the soft gray matter In the' nerve cen-
ters.
A lady tells bow she got well from using
Qrape-Nuts Breakfast Food: "I was
treated by several physicians at the hos-
pital. My disease was pronounced neuras-
thenia (nervous prostration). The doctors
gave me various nerve tonics without
producing any beneficial results. I finally
got so weak that I could not work, either
physically or mentally.
"About two years ago I began the use
of Grape-Nuts, and a marked Improve*
rr.cnt set In at once. In eight weeks I
had regained my strength and could do
xny old work even better than beforeâ
that of writing for the press. All honor
to Grape-Nuts." Name given by Postum ;

Discoveries â Secret Methods
Which Charm and Fascin-
ate the Human Mind.
High Priests of the Occult Reveal
Jealously Guarded Secrets cf
Yearsâ A Wonderful New
Book by Prominent
New York Men.
A wonderful new book, entitled "The Secret
of Power." has Just been issued at &n expense
of over $5000 by one of the leading colleges of
the city of New York. This book Is trom the
pens ot the ablest specialists of modern times.
The authors cave away the copyright on con-
ditions that 10,000 copies should be distributed
to the cubUc free ot charge. The Columbia
Scientific Academy is now complying with this
contract, and until the edition of 10,000 copies
is exhausted you can cet a copy of this book
absolutely free. The book is profusely illus-
trated with the most expensive half-tone Â«n-
fravinss. A is full of wonderful secrets and
Ctartling surprises, and thoroughly explains the
real source of the power of personal influence.
It fully and completely reveals the funda-
mental principles of success and Influence in
every walk 01 life. The hidden mysteries of
personal magnetism, will-power and scientiflo
character reading are explained in an Intensely
interesting manner. Two secret methods of
personal inf.uer.ee are described, which posi-
tively enable any intelligent person to exerose
& marvelous influence and control over any one
whom he may wish. These methods are en-
tirely new end b&ve never before been -mad*
public A reporter has triea them personally
tnd can vouch for their wonderful power. '.
The book also describes absolutely certain
methods by which you can read the character,
secret ar.d lives of every one you meet. No
one can deceive you. You can tell what voca-
tion is beet fcr you to follow. You can know
the secret power by 'which minds of human
being* are charmed and fascinated. The new-
est, latest and best system of physical and
rr.ental culture and magnetic healing Is fully
explained and illustrated by beautiful half-
tone engravings. No such book has ever be-
lore been published. No such wonderful Infor-
mation has ever before been placed in the
bands of the public. On account of the mighty
pewer and Influence placed In one's hands by
tb!s book the X>eziflÂ£ture of the State of New
York debated whether or not the State ought
to permit its promiscuous circulation; but It
was finally decided the good It would aocoxn-
-plish would greatly overcome the 111. and Its
distribution was not interfered frith.
Not long ago John X>. Rockefeller, the rich-
eat man in America, said, in talking to a
Sunday-school class. That he regarded his suc-
cess in life largely to his ability tp Influence
others. Lincoln. Lee, Napoleon and ""Alexander
the Great all won name and renown by their
wonderful power of personal influence. Jay
Gould piled up millions by this earn* power.
J. P. Morgan organized the billion-dollar steel
trust and enriched himself by millions simply
by bis marvelous ability to Influence others.
There are to-day thousands of men with
the brains and education of Mr. Morgan who
are practically paupers. They bare the ability
to organize a trust, but they have' not suf-
ficient power of personal Influence. Personal
Influence, will-power, staminaâ call it what
you will â frag from the creation of man been
the subtle force that has brought wealth, fame
Â¦ and renown to those who were fortunate
enough to possess U.
This strange, mysterious Influence Is Inher-
ent In every human being. By the late meth-
ods explained by the New York specialist in
huisan culture asy intelligent person can de-
%-elop a wonderfully magnetic personality, and
learn bow to read the character, secrets and
tbe lives of others in a. few days* study at nis
own home. Ton can use this marvelous power
without the knowledge of your most Intimate
friends ead associates. Ton can use it to ob-
tain lucrative employment, to secure an ad-
vance In salary, to 'win the friendship and In-
fluence of others, to obtain a greater bhare of
happiness from life. You can be respected,
honored and become a leader In your com-
munity.
If you are not fully satisfied with, your pres-
ent condition and circumstances; If you long
for greater success or more money; If you are
not able to Influence others to the extent you
'desire, the reporter would advise you to write
at once for free copy of this great work now
being given away by tbe Columbia Scientific
Academy.
v _ Mrs. R. C Young of 312 Indiana street. Law-
rence. Kans.. recently seat for a copy of this
book. After carefully examining it and testing
the methods of personal Influence en her friends
and associates she makes the following stats-
menu In a letter to a friend: "Tbe instruc-
tions given by tbe Columbia. Scientific Acad-
emy have been worth to me more than all tbe
previous reading of my life. I wish every
woman In this country could read their grand
book."
Fred Perkins of South Haven, Mich., says:
"I have been In great demand since I read the
work of the Columbia Scientific Academy. Peo-
ple are amazed and mystified at the things I
Co. 1 believe I could make (25 per day reading
character alone If I were to charge for my ser-
vices. If any one would have told I would re-
ceive eo ma'ch wonderful Information I would
have thought him crazy."
Mrs. M. Effle Watson of Martlnsvllle. Ind.,
cays: "Could I have had acceM to such infer-
isetion in past years I could have avoided many
misfortunes. This work of the Columbia Sden-
Â» tlfic Academy shall b? my guiding star the re-
maining days of my life."

High Priests of the Occult Reveal
Jealously Guarded Secrets cf
Yearsâ A Wonderful New
Book by Prominent
New York Men.
A wonderful new book, entitled "The Secret
of Power." has Just been issued at &n expense
of over $5000 by one of the leading colleges of
the city of New York. This book Is trom the
pens ot the ablest specialists of modern times.
The authors cave away the copyright on con-
ditions that 10,000 copies should be distributed
to the cubUc free ot charge. The Columbia
Scientific Academy is now complying with this
contract, and until the edition of 10,000 copies
is exhausted you can cet a copy of this book
absolutely free. The book is profusely illus-
trated with the most expensive half-tone Â«n-
fravinss. A is full of wonderful secrets and
Ctartling surprises, and thoroughly explains the
real source of the power of personal influence.
It fully and completely reveals the funda-
mental principles of success and Influence in
every walk 01 life. The hidden mysteries of
personal magnetism, will-power and scientiflo
character reading are explained in an Intensely
interesting manner. Two secret methods of
personal inf.uer.ee are described, which posi-
tively enable any intelligent person to exerose
& marvelous influence and control over any one
whom he may wish. These methods are en-
tirely new end b&ve never before been -mad*
public A reporter has triea them personally
tnd can vouch for their wonderful power. '.
The book also describes absolutely certain
methods by which you can read the character,
secret ar.d lives of every one you meet. No
one can deceive you. You can tell what voca-
tion is beet fcr you to follow. You can know
the secret power by 'which minds of human
being* are charmed and fascinated. The new-
est, latest and best system of physical and
rr.ental culture and magnetic healing Is fully
explained and illustrated by beautiful half-
tone engravings. No such book has ever be-
lore been published. No such wonderful Infor-
mation has ever before been placed in the
bands of the public. On account of the mighty
pewer and Influence placed In one's hands by
tb!s book the X>eziflÂ£ture of the State of New
York debated whether or not the State ought
to permit its promiscuous circulation; but It
was finally decided the good It would aocoxn-
-plish would greatly overcome the 111. and Its
distribution was not interfered frith.
Not long ago John X>. Rockefeller, the rich-
eat man in America, said, in talking to a
Sunday-school class. That he regarded his suc-
cess in life largely to his ability tp Influence
others. Lincoln. Lee, Napoleon and ""Alexander
the Great all won name and renown by their
wonderful power of personal influence. Jay
Gould piled up millions by this earn* power.
J. P. Morgan organized the billion-dollar steel
trust and enriched himself by millions simply
by bis marvelous ability to Influence others.
There are to-day thousands of men with
the brains and education of Mr. Morgan who
are practically paupers. They bare the ability
to organize a trust, but they have' not suf-
ficient power of personal Influence. Personal
Influence, will-power, staminaâ call it what
you will â frag from the creation of man been
the subtle force that has brought wealth, fame
Â¦ and renown to those who were fortunate
enough to possess U.
This strange, mysterious Influence Is Inher-
ent In every human being. By the late meth-
ods explained by the New York specialist in
huisan culture asy intelligent person can de-
%-elop a wonderfully magnetic personality, and
learn bow to read the character, secrets and
tbe lives of others in a. few days* study at nis
own home. Ton can use this marvelous power
without the knowledge of your most Intimate
friends ead associates. Ton can use it to ob-
tain lucrative employment, to secure an ad-
vance In salary, to 'win the friendship and In-
fluence of others, to obtain a greater bhare of
happiness from life. You can be respected,
honored and become a leader In your com-
munity.
If you are not fully satisfied with, your pres-
ent condition and circumstances; If you long
for greater success or more money; If you are
not able to Influence others to the extent you
'desire, the reporter would advise you to write
at once for free copy of this great work now
being given away by tbe Columbia Scientific
Academy.
v _ Mrs. R. C Young of 312 Indiana street. Law-
rence. Kans.. recently seat for a copy of this
book. After carefully examining it and testing
the methods of personal Influence en her friends
and associates she makes the following stats-
menu In a letter to a friend: "Tbe instruc-
tions given by tbe Columbia. Scientific Acad-
emy have been worth to me more than all tbe
previous reading of my life. I wish every
woman In this country could read their grand
book."
Fred Perkins of South Haven, Mich., says:
"I have been In great demand since I read the
work of the Columbia Scientific Academy. Peo-
ple are amazed and mystified at the things I
Co. 1 believe I could make (25 per day reading
character alone If I were to charge for my ser-
vices. If any one would have told I would re-
ceive eo ma'ch wonderful Information I would
have thought him crazy."
Mrs. M. Effle Watson of Martlnsvllle. Ind.,
cays: "Could I have had acceM to such infer-
isetion in past years I could have avoided many
misfortunes. This work of the Columbia Sden-
Â» tlfic Academy shall b? my guiding star the re-
maining days of my life."

The result of the Tulare County com
mittee's work during the past few days
makes it evident that the excursion
which leaves here on Friday, May 23. will
be a success in point of numbers. Prom
inent business men from this city and
San Jose have signified their Intention of
going- They will be absent but two busi
ness days and will be home on Sunday
night. Round-trip tickets, costing JS, can
be obtained at the Southern Pacific office.
San Francisco Lodge No. 3, Benevolent
and Protective Order of Elks, will have a
gala night at the Grand Opera-house next
Tuesday, the occasion of their annual
benefit performance. A programme jsuch
as only the Elks can gather together has
been prepared and a vaudeville entertain
ment of the highest order is promised.
Edward Harrigan and his excellent com
pany will appear by request in the second
act 'of '"Old Lavender;" the best portion
of that popular play, and Mr. and Mrs %
Gardner Crane of the Grand Opera-house
company will present -the one-act" come
dietta "Am I Yoar Wife?" in which they
made such a hit' at the Orpheum last
year. Lew Sully, the prince of funmakers,
will, run over from the Orpheum for a
while and sing a few ditties and tell sev
eral- stories; Georgie Cooper and her
pickaninnies will come in from the Cen
tral and contribute to the general glee,
and Jessie Dale, the young girl who has
such a phenomenal barytone voice, will
represent the Chutes. The ragtime Floro
dora sextent, which scored such a success
at the actors* fund benellt, has volun
teered, and Frances Graham, the Tivoli's
contralto, will 6lng "If You . Were Only
Mine." from "The Singing Girl." 'Charles
Williams, the most popular entertainer
of the San Jose Lodge of : Klks and a
well-known newspaper m<<m, will present
a monologue entitled "A Stage. Walt," in
which, it is said, he introduces some very
clever character delineations. Most per
formers object to closing a -big show of
this kind, but Ferris Hartman, Harry
C&shman and Edward Webb .of the
Tlvoli. directed by Paul Stelndorff. have
cheerfully consented to wind up' affairs
with the chair trio from "The Singing
Girl." . .
Large herds of Elks are- coming from
Oakland, San .Jose, Stockton, Sacramento
and other interior cities to swell the at
tendance, and a large and fashionable
audience is assured. The theater will be
specially decorated in honor of the occa
sion.

Men's Diseases

O. C. JOSLEN, M.D.
Tbe LieadlBc Specialist.
o o
In the treatment of men's dis-
eases I employ original methods
that fifteen years of careful study
and practice have developed. They
have proven supremely effective.
Like results have beeen attained
by no other forms of treatment.
The cures accomplished mark them
as methods superior to those now
common to the profession. In the-
treatment of some cases my pro-
cedureâis radically different from
the ordinary. In other cases it is
but partially different, but in every
instance I can justly claim origin-
ality and distinctiveness. I men-
tion this because thousands. of men
have employed various specialists,
and have been treated alike and
disappointed alike by each.
Weakness.
| I have conclusively demonstrated the
fact that derangement of the mascu-
line functions is a curable ailment. Br
tbe ploaest observation in thousands of
cases I have ascertained that only in
rare Instances is the nervous system or
general confutation Involved to any no-
ticeable decree Â¦whatever, and that
weakness In all Its phases is merely a
cymptom of local disorder. In by far
the creater s-imber of cases I find the
condition entirely due to a state of in-
flammation or cor.cesUcn in the pros-
tate Kland. or at some other vital point
of the crcanie eyetem, brought on by
early dissipation or lingering as a re-
sult of some contracted disorder. Such
cases may show temporary improve-
ment under stimulating processes of
treatment, but ultimate relapse and In-
Jury &re certain to follow all such
method*'. Tbe only radical cure is the
absolute removal of the abnormal con-
dition responsible for the functional
I disorder, and this I accomplish through
carefully directed local measures. My
treatment is entirely dlrrtnctlve and
original. No other physician employs
Uke methods sor approaches my sur-
eess in curiar. The remits I obtain
are thorough and lasting, and strength
and vigor, are restored in the full and
normal degree.

The result of the Tulare County com
mittee's work during the past few days
makes it evident that the excursion
which leaves here on Friday, May 23. will
be a success in point of numbers. Prom
inent business men from this city and
San Jose have signified their Intention of
going- They will be absent but two busi
ness days and will be home on Sunday
night. Round-trip tickets, costing JS, can
be obtained at the Southern Pacific office.
San Francisco Lodge No. 3, Benevolent
and Protective Order of Elks, will have a
gala night at the Grand Opera-house next
Tuesday, the occasion of their annual
benefit performance. A programme jsuch
as only the Elks can gather together has
been prepared and a vaudeville entertain
ment of the highest order is promised.
Edward Harrigan and his excellent com
pany will appear by request in the second
act 'of '"Old Lavender;" the best portion
of that popular play, and Mr. and Mrs %
Gardner Crane of the Grand Opera-house
company will present -the one-act" come
dietta "Am I Yoar Wife?" in which they
made such a hit' at the Orpheum last
year. Lew Sully, the prince of funmakers,
will, run over from the Orpheum for a
while and sing a few ditties and tell sev
eral- stories; Georgie Cooper and her
pickaninnies will come in from the Cen
tral and contribute to the general glee,
and Jessie Dale, the young girl who has
such a phenomenal barytone voice, will
represent the Chutes. The ragtime Floro
dora sextent, which scored such a success
at the actors* fund benellt, has volun
teered, and Frances Graham, the Tivoli's
contralto, will 6lng "If You . Were Only
Mine." from "The Singing Girl." 'Charles
Williams, the most popular entertainer
of the San Jose Lodge of : Klks and a
well-known newspaper m<<m, will present
a monologue entitled "A Stage. Walt," in
which, it is said, he introduces some very
clever character delineations. Most per
formers object to closing a -big show of
this kind, but Ferris Hartman, Harry
C&shman and Edward Webb .of the
Tlvoli. directed by Paul Stelndorff. have
cheerfully consented to wind up' affairs
with the chair trio from "The Singing
Girl." . .
Large herds of Elks are- coming from
Oakland, San .Jose, Stockton, Sacramento
and other interior cities to swell the at
tendance, and a large and fashionable
audience is assured. The theater will be

Men's Diseases

O. C. JOSLEN, M.D.
Tbe LieadlBc Specialist.
o o
In the treatment of men's dis-
eases I employ original methods
that fifteen years of careful study
and practice have developed. They
have proven supremely effective.
Like results have beeen attained
by no other forms of treatment.
The cures accomplished mark them
as methods superior to those now
common to the profession. In the-
treatment of some cases my pro-
cedureâis radically different from
the ordinary. In other cases it is
but partially different, but in every
instance I can justly claim origin-
ality and distinctiveness. I men-
tion this because thousands. of men
have employed various specialists,
and have been treated alike and
disappointed alike by each.
Weakness.
| I have conclusively demonstrated the
fact that derangement of the mascu-
line functions is a curable ailment. Br
tbe ploaest observation in thousands of
cases I have ascertained that only in
rare Instances is the nervous system or
general confutation Involved to any no-
ticeable decree Â¦whatever, and that
weakness In all Its phases is merely a
cymptom of local disorder. In by far
the creater s-imber of cases I find the
condition entirely due to a state of in-
flammation or cor.cesUcn in the pros-
tate Kland. or at some other vital point
of the crcanie eyetem, brought on by
early dissipation or lingering as a re-
sult of some contracted disorder. Such
cases may show temporary improve-
ment under stimulating processes of
treatment, but ultimate relapse and In-
Jury &re certain to follow all such
method*'. Tbe only radical cure is the
absolute removal of the abnormal con-
dition responsible for the functional
I disorder, and this I accomplish through
carefully directed local measures. My
treatment is entirely dlrrtnctlve and
original. No other physician employs
Uke methods sor approaches my sur-
eess in curiar. The remits I obtain
are thorough and lasting, and strength
and vigor, are restored in the full and
normal degree.

not go ahead with the case. If I let you
f;o will you never take any property be

"1 promise faithfully," replied the girl,
"that I will never do so. I am sure I
don't deserve all the consideration I am

rooms with her young brother.
Mrs. Gilson Intimated that she would
not swear to a complaint, and when asked
by the Judge for her reason she said, in
a voice that trembled with emotion: "Yes

jewelry. I 'missed the things. I told the
landlord, and i he said I had better send
for the police. I. telephoned to some busi
ness friends* and they sent the officers. I
told the officers, what had happened, and
they searched the pawnshops and found
the Jewels, which bad been taken by Miss
Adams, who, had the tickets. I consider
the young lady, very unfortunate, as she
has a brother -dependent upon her. bhe
heretofore led a pure, clean, lovely life,

"Did the desire to take money ever
come over you before?" asked the Judge,
and she replied: "Never before. I never

Judge, and she humbly answered, "Now.I

the best features, however, seem to have
been reserved for the winaup. In respect
to spectacular scenes and interesting pro
grammes, the last weeK promises to far
exceed tne nrst weeks, so that the festi
val, which has proved the most success
ful, most picturesque and most enjoyaoie
of its klna. will go out, as it were, in a
blaze of glory, leaving nothing but pleas
ant memories. ;
On next Tuesday evening will occur,
in all probability, the most spectactular
event ot the fair. On this night the queen
will be Invested with her regal authority.
Accompanied by her court and attired in
her queenly robes, she will make a tour
of the pavilion. The ladies who worked
so industriously for the success of their
various .booths, will Join In the triumphal
promenade, thus displaying their alle
giance to her gracious majesty. The
greatest interest has been aroused by the
contest for queen. Â¦*
Campany U, First Regiment, N. G. C,
has promised 'to give an exhibition drill
Monaay. night. Colonel O'Nell, with his
6taff, will be in attendance to watch his
men execute their maneuvers. The regi
mental.band will also bÂ« on hand to dis
course martial airs. On the same night
Tyrone," Cork, Mayo, Carlow and Louth
booths will all entertain. '.
Is is expected that the attendance will
reach the maximum on Wednesday night,
as the labor unions, with their thousands
of members, have promised to attend that
night, and the Irish Nationalist societies
will alBO be represented. Roscommon and
Kilkenny booths will Â¦ render interesting
programmes. . Â¦-'-â¢Â¦
-The pupils of St. Peter's Academy will
hold their closing, exercises In the pa
vilion on Thursday, night. The exercises
will be under tho auspices of the academy
booth/, and -trill bo held in the art gal
lery. The academy booth Is the only one
at the fair which does not represent some
county of Ireland. Its object is- to raise
money â¢ for providing t better accommlda
tions for the-BJsters of St. Peter's Acad
emy. The ladles who have had charee
of this booth Have succeeded in making it
exceedingly attractive.
Donegal and Kildare counties will have
an opportunity on Friday night of display
ing the talent of their sons and daughters,
and on that night tho members of the
Young Men's Institute will attend the fes
tival. AH the. counties have been noti
fied, and it is expected that the member

have been provided, and the members of
the institute .who have not yet been sup
plied may secure their passports at the
institute headquarters In Pioneer's build
ing. â¢ . - ' â¢ -Â¦
No special programme was rendered last
night, as it was thought'best to give the
visitors an opportunity to inspect the
Jbooths and , other attractions. Lack of
programme did not In the leant Interfere
with the attendance, nor did it decrease
thÂ§. merriment. .
- Although the great Irish festival, which,
since the tint night of its existence has
attracted crowds that have taxed the ca
pacity of Mechanics' Pavilion, has entered,
on; its third and final week, its popular-,
ity Is not decreasing in the least. So suc
cessful has the fair proved and ( so great
has bean. the enjoyment afforded to all
who have attended, that it is a' source of

soon.

Â¦ Another ntrange prediction of that wonderfiil ;ar.d myaterloiis womanâ Ismarâ
, Has been- fulfilled, and Isador Hunter of Pittsburc Pennsylvania, is alive to-day
because he followed her advice, while hfs brother George lies dead because he re-
futed to give credence to her, words of warning. . Â¦'.'Â«,*Â» Â». to-^^.^i
â¢ " In September of last year Isador and George E. Hunter of Pittsburg, Pennsyl-
vania, came to the coast to look after some oil Interests -In Central California;
While here they visited Ismar, whose reputation as ft prophetess, seer and scien-
tific clairvoyant extends all over America.' â¢ -V \;'' â¢ii ; "v"
"Ydu Intend soon to return, to Pennsylvania;' but if you do not leave. Pittsburg
.befon, May, 1902, you will be killed in an explosion In a suburb of- that -city ontne
evening of /May 12 with many others. As. you value your life, don t fall to heed
tnls warning!" are the words she used. 1 aa related by. Mr. Isador Hunter. to a press *
representative last evening at his hotel. Â¦ â¢ , . ! â¢ . ; . i
"Your brother remained in Pittsburg?" asked the reporter. Â¦ . . â¢ Â¦-,:
"Yes; he refused to believe. Ho was a gcod brother, poor fellow; but. he was
slow of credulity. I knew- from the manner in which Ismar uttered the" warning |
thBt WHAT SHE SAID MUST BE. TRUE. I never forgot it, and I. came away...
I had a gx>od excuse to come and bo did George. He promisedtme that for my sake â¢Â¦
ho wculd leave Pittsburg before the 12th. but it seems he didn't.''.- ;Â¦ '
Mr. Hunter spoke with much feeling and said that beyond question he- owed his
llfo to.-Ismar's timely warning. â¢ 'â¢_ . "'' " ._ '"' Â¦Â¦; ' V s
The details of this case prove that had George Hunter taken Ismar 1 a Â¦ prophecy â¢
fierlously. as did Isador. he would now !>o In the full enjoyment of, life; and thst
had Isador not'left Pennsylvania until after the 12th of. May he ; also would in all Â¦
probability have met the same fate as his brother. . '

ment a check for $25 on. the Crocker

account there, and receiving the change.

less, as Rothschild did not have any

"If this lady," continued . the Judge,
"wanted to make any trouble it would go
very hard with you. I am sorry she does
not go ahead with the case. If I let you

"1 promise faithfully," replied the girl,
"that I will never do so. I am sure I
don't deserve all the consideration I am
getting."
"Let the matter be dropped for want of
prosecution." said the Judge, and the de
fendant walked out of the courtroom with

and two other lady friends.

rooms with her young brother.
Mrs. Gilson Intimated that she would
not swear to a complaint, and when asked
by the Judge for her reason she said, in
a voice that trembled with emotion: "Yes
terday afternoon when 1 went to get my
jewelry. I 'missed the things. I told the
landlord, and i he said I had better send
for the police. I. telephoned to some busi
ness friends* and they sent the officers. I
told the officers, what had happened, and
they searched the pawnshops and found
the Jewels, which bad been taken by Miss
Adams, who, had the tickets. I consider
the young lady, very unfortunate, as she
has a brother -dependent upon her. bhe
heretofore led a pure, clean, lovely life,

"Did the desire to take money ever
come over you before?" asked the Judge,
and she replied: "Never before. I never

Judge, and she humbly answered, "Now.I

Every since the . commencement
excellent programmes have been provided,
and the management seemed to bo never
at a loss for new attractions. Many of
the best features, however, seem to have
been reserved for the winaup. In respect
to spectacular scenes and interesting pro
grammes, the last weeK promises to far
exceed tne nrst weeks, so that the festi
val, which has proved the most success
ful, most picturesque and most enjoyaoie
of its klna. will go out, as it were, in a
blaze of glory, leaving nothing but pleas
ant memories. ;
On next Tuesday evening will occur,
in all probability, the most spectactular
event ot the fair. On this night the queen
will be Invested with her regal authority.
Accompanied by her court and attired in
her queenly robes, she will make a tour
of the pavilion. The ladies who worked
so industriously for the success of their
various .booths, will Join In the triumphal
promenade, thus displaying their alle
giance to her gracious majesty. The
greatest interest has been aroused by the
contest for queen. Â¦*
Campany U, First Regiment, N. G. C,
has promised 'to give an exhibition drill
Monaay. night. Colonel O'Nell, with his
6taff, will be in attendance to watch his
men execute their maneuvers. The regi
mental.band will also bÂ« on hand to dis
course martial airs. On the same night
Tyrone," Cork, Mayo, Carlow and Louth
booths will all entertain. '.
Is is expected that the attendance will
reach the maximum on Wednesday night,
as the labor unions, with their thousands
of members, have promised to attend that
night, and the Irish Nationalist societies
will alBO be represented. Roscommon and
Kilkenny booths will Â¦ render interesting
programmes. . Â¦-'-â¢Â¦
-The pupils of St. Peter's Academy will
hold their closing, exercises In the pa
vilion on Thursday, night. The exercises
will be under tho auspices of the academy
booth/, and -trill bo held in the art gal
lery. The academy booth Is the only one
at the fair which does not represent some
county of Ireland. Its object is- to raise
money â¢ for providing t better accommlda
tions for the-BJsters of St. Peter's Acad
emy. The ladles who have had charee
of this booth Have succeeded in making it
exceedingly attractive.
Donegal and Kildare counties will have
an opportunity on Friday night of display
ing the talent of their sons and daughters,
and on that night tho members of the
Young Men's Institute will attend the fes
tival. AH the. counties have been noti
fied, and it is expected that the member
ship will' be well represented*. Tickets
have been provided, and the members of
the institute .who have not yet been sup
plied may secure their passports at the
institute headquarters In Pioneer's build
ing. â¢ . - ' â¢ -Â¦
No special programme was rendered last
night, as it was thought'best to give the
visitors an opportunity to inspect the
Jbooths and , other attractions. Lack of
programme did not In the leant Interfere
with the attendance, nor did it decrease
thÂ§. merriment. .
- Although the great Irish festival, which,
since the tint night of its existence has
attracted crowds that have taxed the ca
pacity of Mechanics' Pavilion, has entered,
on; its third and final week, its popular-,
ity Is not decreasing in the least. So suc
cessful has the fair proved and ( so great
has bean. the enjoyment afforded to all
who have attended, that it is a' source of
regret 'that the festival Is to close so
soon.

Â¦ Another ntrange prediction of that wonderfiil ;ar.d myaterloiis womanâ Ismarâ
, Has been- fulfilled, and Isador Hunter of Pittsburc Pennsylvania, is alive to-day
because he followed her advice, while hfs brother George lies dead because he re-
futed to give credence to her, words of warning. . Â¦'.'Â«,*Â» Â». to-^^.^i
â¢ " In September of last year Isador and George E. Hunter of Pittsburg, Pennsyl-
vania, came to the coast to look after some oil Interests -In Central California;
While here they visited Ismar, whose reputation as ft prophetess, seer and scien-
tific clairvoyant extends all over America.' â¢ -V \;'' â¢ii ; "v"
"Ydu Intend soon to return, to Pennsylvania;' but if you do not leave. Pittsburg
.befon, May, 1902, you will be killed in an explosion In a suburb of- that -city ontne
evening of /May 12 with many others. As. you value your life, don t fall to heed
tnls warning!" are the words she used. 1 aa related by. Mr. Isador Hunter. to a press *
representative last evening at his hotel. Â¦ â¢ , . ! â¢ . ; . i
"Your brother remained in Pittsburg?" asked the reporter. Â¦ . . â¢ Â¦-,:
"Yes; he refused to believe. Ho was a gcod brother, poor fellow; but. he was
slow of credulity. I knew- from the manner in which Ismar uttered the" warning |
thBt WHAT SHE SAID MUST BE. TRUE. I never forgot it, and I. came away...
I had a gx>od excuse to come and bo did George. He promisedtme that for my sake â¢Â¦
ho wculd leave Pittsburg before the 12th. but it seems he didn't.''.- ;Â¦ '
Mr. Hunter spoke with much feeling and said that beyond question he- owed his
llfo to.-Ismar's timely warning. â¢ 'â¢_ . "'' " ._ '"' Â¦Â¦; ' V s
The details of this case prove that had George Hunter taken Ismar 1 a Â¦ prophecy â¢
fierlously. as did Isador. he would now !>o In the full enjoyment of, life; and thst
had Isador not'left Pennsylvania until after the 12th of. May he ; also would in all Â¦
probability have met the same fate as his brother. . '

A warrant was issued for Gano's rear
rest last Thursday, and -when Policeman
Jackxon w*?nt from the North End sta
tion to serve It Colonel Rawles refused
to allow him to make the arrest, as Gano
riad already been released on the writ,
fichn^ider also declined to enter the res
ervation to point Gano out.
It is now alleged by three soldiers that
Policemen Lycctt and Rice, who original
ly- madÂ«s thÂ» arrest, offered to get the'ea**
fixed ' for Jioo. but this the policemen
indignantly deny, eaylnir that the accusa
tion has rxÂ«n made out of malice owing
to the e trained relations existing betw^n
the soldiers and the policeman stationed
near the Presidio.
A conflict of authority has arisen be
tween Colonel R&wles of the Presidio and
the police over Mathcw F. Ga.no, a mem
ber of the Coast Artillery, but nothing
definite will be done till the return of
Chief Wlttman from Sacramento.
Gano was arrested last March on a
charge of attempted burglary at the store
of Henry Schneider, on Greenwich street.
He was held to answer, and after spend
ing forty-eight days In Jail awaiting trial
he was released on a writ of habeas cor
pus by Judge Hebbard. The case had been
assigned to Judge Dunne's court, and
when It was called the defendant failed
to answer to' his name, and an Investi
gation showed that he had been released
on the Trrlt. No one was present before
Judge Hebbard to represent the prosecu

CLAIMS TO BE RELATIVE.
ThÂ« following letter was also received a

who. claims to be a relative of deceased.'
It Is us follows: , Â¦ â¢
Mr. W. P. Foster. San Francisco, Csl.~ -Dear
Â£lr: Through ray son. who Is in Paris, we
liave Just received letter to the proprietor of
the hotel (Denclon), Paris, written by you,
THE Identity of Mrs. Hammond"
.Moore, who took poison In the
Imperial Hotel at Stockton on
the night of January 30 and
died the following day, and who
was Identified as Mrs. Lyle
Dickey on February 5. has been a matter |
which has taken up much of the time of
W. P. Foster, proprietor of the Hotel Re
peller, 8utter street, wbere deceased had
registered and lived for eight months from
May of last year until December.
Foster made up his mind to fathom the
mystery surrounding the much-traveled
woman's history. ' During her stay at the
Repelier she had made herself beloved to
all with whom she came In contact. Her
disposition was kindly and her tempera;
ment happy to all outward appearances.
There was never a sign in her disposition
and demeanor that would have suggested
self-destruction, and when Mr. and Mrs.
Foetsr Identified tho body at Stockton as
that of Mn>. Hammond- Moore they ex
pressed at the time their great astonish
ment.

MEETING IN THE FOURTH.
it is by no means settled that the con
vention will be held In Sacramento. San
Jose has offered a good round sum of
money for the privilege of entertaining
the delegates, and as the State Committee
is in debt, propositions from leading cities
of the State will be entertained. The sen
timent of the committee seems 'to favor
the last week in August as the time for
holding the convention..*
It is the common impression that the
executive committee win recommend the
plan providing for a convention of 829
ueiegaies, or one delegate for every 200
votes, and one for every major fraction
of 2U0. On this basis San Francisco to en
titled to 178 delegates.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee "will meet in this city next Saturday
afternoon to receive the report of the ex
ecutive committee . relative to the time
and place of holding -the* State conven
tion. The sub-committee which was re
cently appointed to apportion the dele
gates by Assembly districts on the basis
of the vote cast for the Republican party
in IK*' met yesterday at the Palace Hotel.
General George Stone, chairman ; W. M.
Cutter, secretary; Jacob Stepracher, as
sistant secretary; Charles Bundschu and
\V. b. Wood were present. The sub-com
mittee will be prepared to, submit a full
report to the executive committee next

resentation official ' election ilgures were
taken, and the allotment of delegates Is
made to Assembly districts as now con
stituted and not as they existed In 1900.

When several persons claim to be entitled to
the easae o-Sce cr franchise one action may
be broufrnl against all such persons, in order
to try their respective rights to such office or
[fattens*.
Quo warranto proceedings is claimed to
U the most expeditious mode of settling
the controversy. When Judge Sloss de
cides which of the two. McComb or Fred
rick, is the usurper, his decision may be
appealed from, but the appeal will not
ttay proceedings. The one whom the
court's flndlns"* tavor~will -b* Invested,
with ti.e office, ir Attorney General For J
had not entered the controversy and At
t jruey Ruef had appealed to the Supreme
Court the case would In all probability
have remained In abeyance for a consid
erable time, during which the present
farcical and confusing conditions would
'continue to exist at the City Hall, to the
great inconvenience of all litigants.
The following Is the substance of the
Attorney General's complaint:
An action may be brought by the Attorney
General. In the same of the people of this
Â£tate. upon bis own inrcnr.ation or upon the
complaint cf a private party, against any per
ton who usurps, intrude* Into or unlawfully
holds or exercises *ay public office, civil or
military, or any franchise within this State.
Ar,<J the Attorney General * raufct bring- the ac
tion whenever he has reason to believe that
tag such oince or franchise baa been usurped,
irtruded upon or unlawfully held or exercised
ty any person, or when he is directed. to do
fvi bjr the Governor.
The Attorney General gets the right to
Jc!n the claims of both contestants in the
Evoae suit from section iOs, which pro
vides:
The contest for the office of Justices"
clerk which has been carried on so long
anfi so obstinately by Powel Fredrick
and George S. McComb at last appears to
be It; a fair way of settlement. Attorney
General Ford has taken a hand In the
matter and by virtue of the authority
vested In him by the Code of Civil Pro
cedure commenced quo warranto proceed
icgs yesterday in the Superior Court
against both McComb and Fredrick on
the ground that they are / usurpers. This
sction, it Is expected, will completely clear
the title to the office. The case will be
tried before Judge Sloss.
Section S03 of the Code of Civil Pro

derives his power to take part in the
clerkship contest, reads as follows:

Mr. "Broadhurst has heretofore devoted
his time to .writing laughable ;. corned ies
and he. fears the public will r-etalr^ an im
pression that he Is a funny man and laugh
at his more 'serious efforts. .-...*. .
In :Ei>*aMng- about this' yesterday â¢ he
baid It-reminded 'him of the humorous lec
turer.who secured a laugh the moment he
walked -on the platform.-^One'.hikht the
funny fellow .received atelegraTn" just be
fore .opening" the programme. ..It stated
that 'his wife's .toother was dead. Natur
ally he was â¢ depressed ;and- declined to pa
on. The hall Waa "crpwded' and the man
ager appealed td- him >U>- square him with
the audlen^eij-.VwitMr.much. sorrow the
man with a reputations of being a humor
ist appeared on the 'stage with a lugubri
ous expression: on bis. face.
1 "Ladies and "gentlnmen," he said, "I
-cannot lecture to-night as my mother-in
law Is dead." The audience howled with
glee and the humorist was shocked, but
â¢ the more he strove to impress them with
the truth of his statement the heartier
they laughed. The hall was only cleared
by a threat to turn out the lights.
Mr. Broadhurst informed his interview
er how he broke into the play writing busi
ness. - He said he was employed at the
old Bush-street Theater many years ago
and .Branson Howard, author- of "Shenan
doah'.' .and Â¦ "Aristocracy." suggested to
him -that ho ought, to try his hand â¢ at
writing, a- play, as he possessed the dra
matic Instinct. He took his advice and hit
It off the first time he tried. "The Specu
lator" was the title of the comedy, and It
made good from the beginning. Then came
ritlier successes, and now Mr. Broadhurst
is' looked upon as one of. the best, play

Strossmayer Council.
Strossmayer Council of the Y. M. I.
has arranged for a social to be given In
Union Square Hall on the 2Sth lnst. '
This action of the Commissioner of Nav
igation guarantees to the Glldemeister the
protection of the American flag on her
voyage to her home port. When she ar
rives there she may register under any
foreign flag her owner may select.
The Otto Glldemelster at last has been
granted American registry, but under
certain conditions that make the registry
of but little: and only temporary value.
The Glldemelster was abandoned at sea
last year, and the wreck was bought as
such by George F. Ellis, an American citi
zen. The vessel had been flying the Ger
man flag, but being wrecked outside of
the jurisdiction of any nation, she came
into port an orphan without national fa
ther or mother. Mr. Ellis made certain
repairs and fitted her for sea and applied
for American registry, which would entitle
her to float the American flag at her
masthead and be eligible for enrollment
In the coasting trade between Hawaii, the
Philippines and Pacific Coast ports of the
United States, but the application was not
granted. A dispatch received yesterday
by Customs Collector Stratton from E. T.
Chamberlain, Commissioner of Naviga
tion, announced that the shtp had been
granted American registry for her voyage
to her home port, but would not be al
lowed to engage in any coastwise trade,
nor to receive any subsidy or other aid
from the Government.
GILDEMEISTER GRANTED
AN AMERICAN REGISTRY
Marsellls, pursued htm into the kitchen,
knocked him down and was soundly beat
ing him when Mrs. Marsellls interfered.
She dragged Lewis off and he departed.
Marscllis shook hlmrelf together, left the
house and did not return until Monday
morning. He declares that his wife was
not hurt during the struggle. - Â¦.- -
HEARD SISTER SCREAM.
It was during this battle, Mrs. Keller
says, she heard her sister's screams.
The version of the fight Is that given by
Marseliis to-night at the Inquest.- : -
Neighbors thereabouts heard the battle
and summoned Deputy Marshal Preston.
He was told that Marsellls had been
lighting with Lewis because he objected
to the visitor's attentions to his wife.
There was nothing said then* about Mrs.
Marsellls' active part in the quarrel, so
the officer departed. It is now the theory
of the Investigating officers that the dead
woman may, have received her injuries
during that trouble, although Marsellls
Insists his wife was not hurt then, ex
plaining that she made no complaint the
next day when he returned home.
It Is common neighborhood talk that
Lewis had been a frequenter of the Mar
s*Ills place. He Is a farmer, and has also
been in the livery business In San Fran
cisco. The officers are trying* to find him,
and have requested the Sheriff of Contra
Costa County to look for him at Lewis'
home across the county line, j
Marcellls does not deny that Lewis hus
been a visitor at his home, but he says It
Is his slster-In-Iaw that Lewis has been
giving attention. . - . .
HUSBAND LEAVES HOUSE.
As soon as Mrs. Marsellls died the hus
band, with his two children, went to his
fuher's home at 2912 Wheeler, street,
Lo'rln. There he remained urfder cover
until late this . afternoon, when he made
a statement concerning the trouble, which
was very like. the evidence which be gave
tt -night. .
The <dead woman was Caroline Keller,
member of an- old Contra Costa County
family. At the time of her father's death
she. was left considerable property. She
married Marsellls when he was a boy of
17, employed on her father's ranch, just
nrrotiA the county line from' Berkeley.
Their life has-been an unhappy one, ac
cording to Mrs; B. Marsellls. the hus
band's grandmother. /She said :
It Is true that Hanlan has frequently beaten
Caroline. He Is violent of temper and a heavy
drinker. Caroline cot a divorce from him last
October because of his , cruelty, , but they be
came reconciled again last February.
During the married life of the ' Marsei
lles matters went from bad to worse until/
they landed in the tumbled down place ar
the edge of town, where the tragic end to
the wife came. Â¦ , . â¢;
The Lewis who crops up as the possible
cause of I Marsellls' ' furious and Jealous
rage had been seen, around the, place
many times. He went to see Mrs. Mar
sellls on Sunday night. It Is said.- to de
mano the return of a watch he had given
her. Lewis. had been working around the
Marnellls place during the separation of
the husband and wife. It was about that
time that jealousy began to cause domes
tic Jars/ Coroner Mehrmann summoned
the following Jury to-night to the Inquest
in the case of Mrs." Marsellls, which was
held at the branch Morgue In Berkeley:

BUTCHERS' RAGES

The story also runs that Dr. Gladding
had openly refused to go to the Inquest
because he had not been summoned to
hold the autopsy.
The fight of last Sunday night was
started because of the visit to the Mar
eellls* house of Frank Lewis, or- "Jeff,"
an he Is called by the husband. It wus
about 10 o'clock at night when Marseliis
saw Lewla talking In the yard to his wife.
The husband went out and struck. Lewis
With a block of wood. ".Teff" turned on
Dr. Gladding told me that he had received
a statement from Mm. Maraellla before her
death as to the cause of her Injury. He Is not
.prenent and I shall be compelled to postpone
further hearing at the Inquest until Monday
nljcht to get hlÂ« testimony.
The surgeons found externally a deep,
fresh bruise on the breast, bruises and
contusions on the right blp and more
bruises on the legsâ injuries which could
not have been cauaed by a fall, but were
the reHUlt of blows, the surgeons said.
Then there was a fatal rupture In the
abdominal region, which, they declared
to Coroner Mehrmann. was caused by di
rect violence. The member Injured, the
hepatic artery. Is so situated anatomi
cally, they explained, that It could only
have been fractured by direct violence â
a kick from a foot incased in a heavy
boot, perhaps.
And there is a story about that. Dr.
Charles F. Gladding received a deathbed
statement from Mrs. Marsellls which
would Ihrow much light upon the strange
case. But Dr. Gladding was not present
at the Inquest this evening, although the
Coroner had pubpenaed the absent doctor.
The Coroner paid:
SURGEONS' DISCOVERIES.
There Is the testimony at to-night's In
quest of Mrs. Katie Keller, the dead
woman's sister, who heard during the
fight a sound as if her sister screamed.
It was a strangled scream, as If sho had
be^n choked. Mrs. Keller was lying sick
in a front room of the house. ,
Wound about this mysterious death Is
the story of an unhappy domestic life,
the intrusion of one "Jeff" Lewis, and
a culmination last Sunday night of a
three-cornered battle at the Marseliis
home. In which the husband aj>Â«l Lewis,
with Mrs. Marsellls a third party, were
engaged.
Mrs. Marsellls died at her home on San
Pablo avenue and Virginia street, at the
edge of Wildcat Creek, last night. Dr.
Charles F. Gladding, who was called to
attend the woman, refused to sign a death
certificate because of the suspicious cir
cumstances surrounding the death. The
Coroner took charge. Under the investi
gations to-day of Autopsy Surgeons Dr.
Frank Payne and Dr. H. N. RowcTl. there
was uncovered enough evidence to war

lodged. But who committed what ap

The sub-contractors take the position
that they are compelled to adopt their
rule as a matter of self-protection because
the Builders' Association, which. is com
posed of the big contractors, passed a rule
forbidding members of the Sub-contrac
tors' Association from doing work for any
builder not a member of the Builders' As
sociation. The Journeymen mechanics de
cline to be made - to act the part of a
buffer between the builders and the sub
contractors and declare that they will
work for anybody who pays union wages.
SACRAMENTO, - May 17. â Building
trades are temporarily tied up. . by the
strike of the union, painters, who are sup
potted by the Building Trades Councu.
It is a novel situation, for j the reason
that ft is a struggle between a, union or.
employers on one- hand and a union of
employes on the other. /The Contractors'
Association, generally called the Sub-con
tractors' Association, composed of boas
painters, 'boss paperhangers, boss plum
bers, boss lathera and the like, issued the
following notice to the journeymen pf
their tradA to-day:
The members of this association regard 'con-'
ti actors not belonslng to our association aÂ»
unfair and we alao regard mech*nics working
for unfair contractors *uÂ» unfair, and we abÂ»o
regard Journeyictn who take Jobs trom owner*
oÂ£ buildings by contract,, or by ttie jl*y a*
unfair. < ' : " Â¦"..*". *
The mechanics say that an attempt on
the part of the SuD-contractors' Associa
tion to carry out this idea has caused tne
present atriKe; that the Sub-contractors
Association discriminated against a union
painter in good stanaing in nis own union
ana practically gave him the "lockout"
as unfair because he did . not Â¦' obey Â¦ the
rules laid down by the Sub-contractor*'
Association. The r'ainters* Union protest
ed, claiming that the action of the Sub
contractors' Association was unjust, and
got the support of the Building Trades
Council.
According to a union mechanic, tne po
sition of the Sub-contractors' Association*
is that a journeyman who works for any
one not a member of the Sub-contractors*
Association is thereafter to be debarred
from working for any member of the as
sociation. " . *.Â¦
Reports received at strike : headquarters
to-day -were to tne eftect that the order
to strike was being carried out to the let
ter. Several rumora reached here to-day
that non-union men, of wnom there are
comparatively, few, had made attempts to
return to . work in some localities, but
none of "these reports could be verified.

Gompers of the American Federation of
Labor to-day said that no propositions
bad been outlined for submission to either
side of the anthracite coal strike, looking
to adjustment of the troubles. He stated
that as president of the Federation, a

sible to settle the differences, but that if
any adjustment satisfactory to both sides
could not be reached he proposed to stand

President Mitchell remained â¢ close to
headquarters and spent a busy day going
o\er matters pertaining to millers in
many .States. .Nothing official was given
out to-uay regarding the calling out of tne
bituminous men. it is understood, how
ever, that the three district presidents of
the anthracite fields are in communication
with the presidents of bituminous districts
for the purpose of getting two of them to
make up the five necessary- to- call a spe
cial national convention to consider tne
advisability of calling out the soft coal
miners. 'This is believed to be a mere
Icrinality, as it is thought the West Vir
ginia and Michigan districts, will agree to
the assembling of such a convention.

mediately, went Into conference behind
closed doors.- Secretary Eaaley stated
that -bis purpose waa to "look over the

PEKING, May 17.â An important ques
tion has arisen between China and the
powers interested concerning the pay
ment of the Chinese Indemnity. China
claims that the protocol stipulates that
payment should be made of 450,000,000 taels
in silver, regardless of the rate of ex
change.
The construction put upon the protocal
by the foreign Ministers is that China
shall pay in gold or sliver the equivalent
of gold at the time of payment. The
steady fall In silver since the protocol
was signed has imposed great hardship
"sir Ernest' Satow. the British Minister,
recently consented to a provisional divi
sion of the installments already paid, on
the basis of a pro rata reduction. In the
meantime United States Minister Conger
had received instructions to reduce the
claim of the United States by *l.(W.,000.
which complicates the question, and It id
thought that the United States,, in view
of Great Britain's compromise, will with
draw the offer of a reauci.on.
The Dowager Empress has Issued an
edict censuring Yuan Shai Kai. director
general of the Peking-Shanhaikwan Rail
way, and Director of Railways Hu Yu
Fen for signing the railroad agreements
aud ordering the Board of Punishment to
prescribe suitable penalties for the of
fense. Officials say the Russian repre
sentations that gave the British control
of the railway at the expense of China's
!nterests caused the edict. The prestige
of Yuan Shai Kai and Hu Yu Fen is like
ly to be sTeriously affected.
Among the Chinese it is believea that-
Great Britain will consent to modify the
first railway agreement by waiving the
provision for military directors.

James Markham Ignores a
Command to Hold Up
His Hands
SACRAMENTO. May 17.â A footpad shot
and probably fatally wounded James
Markham, foreman of a Southern Pacific
bridge crew, at Eighth and N streets*, at
iu:30 o'clock to-night- Markham was on
his way home when he was commanded
by a man wearing a mask to hold up his
hands. As many persons were in mask
to-night, celebrating the closing of the
Street Fair, Markham believed the foot
pad was one of the revelers and paid no
attention to the order. He was again
commanded to hold up his hands, and
upon his second refusal the footpad fired,
the bullet entering Markham's left side,
penetrating the abdomen. He was taken
to the railroad hospital for treatment.
The surgeons of that institution hold out
email hope of his recovery-
Tnere have been three shootings by
footpads during this week, with one fa
tality. Julius Blrchler. a saloon-keeper,
was killed on Wednesday night Just as he
was about to leave his saloon. Before
closing up for the night he had ordered
a couple of men out of his place, and the
police are of the opinion that one of them
is Birchler's murderer. The other case
was that of a boy who, upon refusing to
hold up his hands, was shot at by a foot
pad, narrowly escaping being struck by
the bullet.

also be installed. Shipments from the
Sunset district are expected to begin soon.
That the excursion of San Francisco business
men Into - the Kern River field will be pro
ductive of much . good for the Industry gen
erally must be conceded. â¢ Judging from ex
pressions made by the visitors an actual ' view
of the developments to be seen there the ex
cursion was a great success as an educator.
Mojt of the guests of the town were until
yesterday wholly unfamiliar with the process
of extracting petroleum from the ground and
most of them also had a secret misgiving that
the thing was not by any means what ft was
cracked up to be. None of them now believe
that the tales he haa heard were exaggerated.
The evidence of these people to be given in
the future upon- occasion will do much to
create a stability that cannot be disturbed.
The I people of Kern County scored a
hit when they took the San Francisco
business men's party over to the Kern
River oil field. Out of 120 persons not a
dozen had eVer viewed the California oil
industry. There were among them a large
number of manufacturers and others who
use power. At the end of their journey
they were astonished at what they Had
seen and freely confessed that fact. They
had viewed miles of the pipe line along
the trackage of- the Santa Fa railway
through the valley. Occasionally they
saw a camp of the workmen who are lay
ing down the pipe line, - and the whole
process was made plain to them. In the
Held they saw the hundreds of derricks
and the scores of louding racks and the
great collection of tanks which the Stand
ard OH - Company has already Installed
at the beginning of the pipe line from the
Kern River field to Point Richmond, tho
present tankage array being only pre
liminary to- the other tanks that have
been ordered, which will be largely in
creased as outstanding orders are filled.
Before the party departed from the field
It was treated to the novel sight, to them,
of the burning of oil In the sump holes.
Two masses of oil were lighted simulta
neously and the air was darkened with
huge columns of black smoke, in the
midst of which were vivid flashes of light
and puffs of gas from the burning oil.
The Kern County people think they
have ' gained something by their enter
prise and hospitality, and such is un
doubtedly the. fact. The Calif ornlan says
on that, point:

The county of San Bernardino U rapidly
coming to the front as a mineral producing
section by reason -of the recent discoveries
made within Its borders. Of the 20,000 square
miles of area Included In the county, only COO
square miles can be termed agricultural. ' It
Is now learned that at the east end . of the
Kingston Mountains, in the northeast corner of
the county, large deposits of corundum, better
known as emery, have been discovered. This
product Is valuable and the samples received
are said by the Times-Index to have been pro
nounced most excellent material by the chem
ists to whom they were submitted. -Crystals
accompanying the product indicate 'that It is
just possible that sapphires may be found In
the same deposits. A gold strike Is also re
ported from township 2 north and range 2 east
that Is said to be one of the richest made on
the coast. The discoverer Is an old prospector
named Robert Yantsey. and the location Is Just
south of and only a short distance from the
old Mormon trail from Salt Lake to San Ber
nardino. It is about eighteen miles ! west til
Marl Springs and about twenty-two miles east
it 8oda Lake. It will only be about fifteen
miles from the San Pedro. Los Angeles and
(Salt Lake road, now building. As soon as the
news of the strike spread abroad locations were
made until over thirty claims had been staked
out at the time the bearer of the news left for
the city. A wagon load of specimens were
taken to Fenner for shipment to San Francisco
to be worked at the Selby Works. The ore Is
found In wide ledges In a decomposed quarts,
all free milling, and with the gold very fine.
The Los Angeles Herald says concern-
Ing the development of gold in the south:
SOUTHERN DEVELOPMENTS.
In-Calaveras County the Gwln mine. Is In
creasing Its already lame output; the Melones
has JuÂ« started up with an enormous body of
prayed ore blacked out, ready for breaking
for the mill. The Sheep Ranch mine, on the
east belt of the lode. Is proving the beginning
of & new mine where 'the bottom of an old
one was supposed to be. All of these In tht
'80s were considered worked out and were
abandoned by the owners; yet. they are greater
mines to-day than ever before. Another mlue.
the Koyal. Is working In a CO-foot wide or*
body and considering a 200-statnp mill. In
Tuolumne County there Is observable the same
change from abandoned mln*s and silent mills
to acttve going concerns more, productive than
ever before, ' and more firmly established as to
permanence of operation. The preceding records
but a small part of the active and nuccÂ«s8ful
gold mining of the mother lode. It I* not an
activity that .attracts much outside attention.
It Is accepted as a matter of course by those
who .best know It. It Is not at all spectacular.
No great combinations of outside capital play
with It as If It were a pawn In a bankers'
game of high finance. It Is simply a free,
self-contained mining Industry, the opportuni
ties of which are not monopolised, simply be
cause monopoly of them Is Impossible. - Â¦ .
Twenty years ago there was just one mine
on the mother lode in Amador County operat
ing-, and In Calaveras tuid Tuolumne counties
not more than two or three In each. In El
Dorado and Marlposa counties none at all were
In operation. The chance from then is strik
ing. In Amador County, at Plymouth, a doken
mines, unknown or little known twenty years
ago, are developing into the producing stajce.
Going south along the lode the Gover and
Fremont mines have pay ore. The old Key
stone mine, at Amador, has a pay lode on
Shlch mining is Just commencing. The Spring
111 mine, at the same place, has also a great
body of nay ore. At Butter Creek the Ken
nedy. Argonaut. Central Eureka. South Eu
reka and Wlldman-Mahoney are all producing
from ore bodies â some near the surface. In
ground missed In the early exploitation of these
mines, others, at depths far below what it was
considered was the bottom of pay ore two
decades since.
ITS WEALTH INCREASES.
The mother lode in California does not
lose its productiveness 'in gold with In
creasing years. If changing at all. it is
increasing Its output. The Mining and
Scientific Press calls attention to theso
facts;
In connection with this general state
ment, attention Is called to the fact that
the business men of San Francisco, who
have already toured a part of the San
Joaquin 'Valley in searcn of information
and to hasten the work of promoting tho
prosperity of the interior, are prepared on
their trip that they will soon make
through the Sacramento Valley to pay
attention to the northern mineral belt,
getting as much . knowledge of It as can
be gamed at Redding and other places
at which stops will be made. This will
give the miners a chance to get some
tacts before the business men which will
undoubtedly be improved.
Shasta County and the north generally
are in a time of steady and large devel
opment, the San Bernardino papers tell
of new gold Holds In Arizona, and in Ore
gon and Washington the sound of prog
ress among the mines is heard. The dis
covery of many economies and more sci
entific prospecting are hand in hand in
advancement. . One thing is certain, which
is that the fame of California as a min
eral State will grow for many succeeding
years. â Â¦
Never' has the tone of the California
miners been more hopeful than It Is now.
Attention Is called to the comments print
ed In this article in reference to the In
crease, of activity ort the mother lode. In
the same line, unmistakably indicating
the increase of the determined mineral
aiea of California and also of tho other
fcHates of the Paclilc Coast, are other
comments made by Journals published
uear the fields of mineral exploitation.

All these troubles can be cured if the woman, careless of her dress
"ill but take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. If she docs'
that, before long she won't know herself. Her husband once more will
take pride in her. and every one will remark how changed she is. Mrs
Pinkhami! medicine is certainly ideal for women who are afflicted with
nervousness or any illness of the feminine organs. It always helps women
whose ideas of life are warped because the brain is instantly responsive to
the condition of the reproductive system. There is no doubt about its effl:
ciency for female complaints.
Of course, this is an extreme case, and I merely quote it to show what
these things may lead to. It is woman's natural instinct to make herself
attractive. She wishes to be admired and adored, and she likes .to Con-
ceal her bad points as well as sÂ»he can, making the most of what ls good
about her face and figure. When a woman does riot do th'is. when she
prows careless of her dress and doesn't care whether she bathes or not.
she is sick. Perhaps, if you ask her, she will not acknowledge there Is
any rain or anything wrong with her. But soon she will confide in you.
There is a heavy 1 feeling, not exactly pain, but she feels depressed. Tho
head aches frequently, and often there is a bearing-down pain that makes
her irritable. She doesn't consider any of these things worth bothering
about, but that, too. is because she Is sick. She neglects them as well as
her dress because she has lost her interest in the things that go to make
up life for a strong, healthy woman.
Of course these women do not pay attention to their dress because they
haven't the energy to do so. In a word, they are sick. Neglecting the dress
1* one of the first symptoms of illness with a woman. It is the result of a
depressed condition of the nervous system, due to some trouble with the
female organism, that has not yet, perhaps, declared itself In actual pain.
Why, I know one woman who went so far as to hide her soiled clothing in a
trunk and lock it up, that it might not go to the laundry. The friends of thi3
woman decided that there was really something wrong with herâ she was
hysterical and nervous, although she complained of no especial painâ and
called in a doctor. Of course he didn't understand the case, and gave a tonic
to bring temporary relief from the hysteria, but didn't attempt to put that
woman in a normal condition. After that some one told her about Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and induced her to take it. with the re-
sult that she is getting stronger every day. She no longer Ignores her ap-
pearance the way she did; her complexion is clear, she walks briskly, and her
clothes are carefully cleaned and put on properly. No one would recognize in
her the woman she was six months ago. Yet that doctor said she never could
recover until the change came with her. "Why, if she hadn't taken Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine, the chances are she would have become worse and wors<?,
until insanity would have declared itself. . . *
There's another kind of woman, who is even worse than these, and she's
the woman who never has the time nor the inclination to take the necessary
baths or to change her underclothing. She isn't even ashamed to have oth-r
members of the family call her attention to her habits, but merely loses her
temper at their interference. There are plenty of these womenâ women who
wear the same underclothing~day after day, and do not understand why they
should not do so.
Then there is the stout, substantial-looking woman who is always too
tired to walk, and who cannot stand having a collar put on properly, and
who always does manage somehow to get her hat on crooked and to keep it
so. Her skirts, too, always drag in the mud and invariably need a binding.
There's the tall, thin woman who always walks with her stomach out,
her back in and her shoulders rounded. All she needs is to straighten her-
self up, to pin her skirt up in the back and down in front and to walk as
I .hough she had a backbone.
Most of the time she cannot devote the necessary few minutes to brush-
inp her dress, and it is edged around the bottom with a crust of mud,
and half the time the binding is worn through. . Her hair usually hangs
â¢with a lot of scolding locks in the back, and altogether she is a most for-
lorn-looking creature. Her friends are ashamed to meet her, and she, when
anything is said about her appearance, exclaims: "Ofc! what's the use of my
bothering! I'm not pretty, and things will not look right, no matter what I
do." She doesn't understand that being pretty lies largely with the woman
and how she handles herself.
Was there every any one more unfortunate than the sloppy woman! No
matter how handsome her clothes, they never look right. Her waist and her
skirt do not meet at the back, or if they do the belt hangs down far below
where it should come; her stomach sticks out, her shoes go uncleahed for
days, her gloves are out at the finger.

showers occurred on several days, some in the
epstern counties on the 7th being the heaviest

rains two weoks aro.
Garden vegetables have made excellent pro
tres*. Field potatoes are comtng up well, and

NEW YORK, May. 17.â "tV Commercial" Ad
vertiser'! London financial cablegram "says:

Tho loss of $24,073,700 In deposits correspond*
very closely with the total, of. tho : decrease In
lonns and the net reduction In caoh, the dtlTor
cn?o being only $42,700. Tho statement In this
respect, therefore, ts surprisingly harmonious.'
It may bo noted that tho decrease In deposits
since February 21. when the maximum of tho
yenr was recorded, has been $83,312,300
Comparisons of changes In the Items of loans
and rpcele of the leading banks show that
eleven Institutions lost $18,900,000 of loans
while these eleven banks Increase In specie to
a net amount of $l,sno,000. The largest losses
in tho former were $6,200,000 by one and $4
700,000 by two dthcriv .while tho notablo gains
in iinecle were $4,100,000 by ono bank and $Â«.:.
800.000 by another. . : *-
Thr Financier says: Th* most striking fea
ture of the official statement of the New York
Associated Banks last week was the reduction
of $22.MÂ«.l<J0 In loans. There was a net loss
of $1,132,900 ln cash, and a decrease, through
the reduction of $24,073,700 ln deposits, of $Â».
018,425 In reserve requirements. Consequently
thÂ« surplus reserve was augmented by 14,885 -
025 to **.:u<f.5*V>. A -year ago the surplus was
$21.2SS,97rÂ». The contraction ln loans was clear
ly foreshadowed early In the week, when there
was evidence that the syndicate which had re
cently conducted very large negotiations In
r&llroad and other properties had completed
their deals and presumedly had repaid the
loans which they had effected for this purpose.
This cancellation of loans tended to ruxtoro
this account of the banks to more normal oon
dltlons and further contraction on Monday and
Tuesday in connection with tho payments for
the steel underwriting dividend and dlsbumo
in-ntE on account of Mexican National Rail
road reorganization and later .liquidation of
loans by stock and exchange borrowers,' will go
far tÂ« explain the later reduction In this Item
shewn by the official statement. ' It I* rotc

ymr, since March 1. has been (40,734,700
Tho net loss of $1,1:12,000 cash, as above

The feature of the San : Francisco market at

advanced .prices sharply, as will be seen.
Stocks of Prunes, too, arc getting whittled
down, and are" said to be practically exhausted
outside of thÂ« few left In the "Santa Clara,
Valley, and as the crop prospects are not as
brilliant as a month ago the goods are work

CHICAGO, May 17.â There were both weak
and strong spots In wheat during the morning,
but the advantage favored the former. The
local crowd -tfas Inclined to sell. Weather was
ideal for crops save. In the Northwest, where
continued rains were still retarding the spring
seeding. Advices trom Manltoban crops stated
that the seeding had been done and that there
was still twenty million bushels of wheat on
hand. Prices for Manitoba dipped to %c under
Chicago, whereas a*week ago It' was lc higher.
London was weaker. A little better export de
mand was reported and strengthened the pit
for a time. Early In the session the spread
between July and September widened to 2%c,
but the crowd became uneasy over the pos
sibilities of an oversold September market and
covered some accounts. July opened %Â®*ic
down to unchanged at 74%c to 74%tt75c and
gold to "5 %c. Corn weakness depressed It to
74 %c. but the closÂ« was only easy, %c under
at 74%Â«74%c.
Conditions In born were similar to those in
wheat. July closed weak, %&%c lower at
fclftc.
Oats were dull. The cart demand was fair.
'July closed %ff%c lower at 3Â«%c.
Provisions showed remarkably small action
tonsiderlng the light run of hogs and strong
market at the yards. Prices showed almost no
change. July pork closed unchanged, lard a
shade up and ribs a shade lower.

United States 3s declined % and alt other
I*bu*p V, per cent below the closing call of
Ian week.
The stock market has settled back Into a
seasonable condition of dullness during the
week at a generally lcwer level of prices. A
process of readjustment ha* been In progress
buth In the stock market and the money mar
ket. This has been accomplished rather by
a shifting of accounts than by any active li
quidation, although there were some sharp de
clines forced on Monday incident to the dis
crimination by the money lenders against some
oC the collateral that has found Its way Into
loans during the late season of liberal credits.
This weeding-out process was the consequence
of the previous developments in the Webb-
Meyer Flocks and the constriction of the money
supply that bad been dlscloaed by the ttank
statement of last Saturday. Energetic meas
ures tor tbe recuperation of the money market
were taken, which were facilitated by the high
rate for money ruling here. Supplies of loan
able fund* were thus attracted to New York
from all domesttc centers and foreign sources
were drawn upon even more heavily. The rate
for sterling exchange relapsed violently to the
lowest point of the year under the heavy offer
ings of bankers' bills in the process of draw-
Ing on foreign credits. â¢ The supply of commer
cial exchange bills In the market was very
scarce mmi the bills sold were in effect short
sales and represented In a degree a specula
tion against the future supply of exchange de
pending on the corn crop and the .resumption
of corn exports. In any event the week's re
plenishment of loanable resources from foreign
markets represents obligations to be met ln the
future.. It was the realization of this fact
that checked a renewal of speculative buying
of stocks after the m^aeures of relief for the
money market became effective and the interest
rate declined. Another phase of- the process
was the transfer of holdings of American se
curities for domestic account to London.
Americans cabled orders to London to buy
Â¦â¢locks there to be hÂ«ld with money borrowed
in London. This process of transfer accounted
for the undertone of resistance to depression
la the local market. It Is an evidence of con-'
fidence in ttoe value of securities which are be
ing forced to a lower level of prices by the exi
jrencies of the domestic money market. The
T-eek's readjustment has restored the balance
in both the stock and money markets, but the
demands upon the money supply are felt to pre
clude the chance of a favorable speculation for
a rise. The anthracite labor trouble Is an ad
ditional incentive to conservatism. The im
mediate effect of the declaration of the strike
ui*m the coal stocks was not acute, especially
considering tbe assurance which has constantly
been expreefed in Wall etreÂ«t that there would
bÂ«- no ctrlke. The anthracite operators profend
to feel that they have much to gain from con
testing the demands of thÂ« miners from the
way of recoveries of recession. This does not
blind the public perception to the possibilities
of an extension of tbe trouble Into the bitu
minous coal fields and the collateral effects
upon other Industries. ,eÂ«orcially Iron and steel.
In which continued icarclty or material In all
stages is reported, in spite of the record output
in the trade. The crop situation has been
very attentively studied during the week. The
outcome of the year's cereal crop is regarded
as of prime Importance in the coming year's
Prosperity. The monthly Government report on
Monday was expected to show an Important
decline ln the condition of the winter wheat,
but the amount of acreage abandoned was a
disagreeable surprise. It was argued, how
ever, that the favorable weather since the date
of the report must have improved the condi
tion of the winter wheat, while the damage to
the abandoned acreage had come early enough
to permit of replanting with the all-Important
corn crop. With that crop barely in the
ground and the spring crop still to be indicated
the final outcome Is felt to be too obscure yet
to warrant 'speculative ventures. The pro
gressive dullness of tbe market has been due
in small part to this cause. The distribution
en Monday of a $10,000,000 dividend to the
subscribers of the United States Steel Corpora
' tion underwriters' syndicate attracted attention
to the rnormouH profits of underwriting. The
total subscriptions werÂ» for (200.0o0.000. Of

WHEATâ The foreign markets were unin
teresting. There"wlll be no more English mar
kets till Wednesday.
Chicago was firm and' inactive, with tbe
weather . favorable, except ln the Red River
Valley, where it is too wet. There is consid
erable pressure from short selling on account
of this favorable weather. Stocks at Minne
apolis decreased 801,570 bushels during the
week. v . .
< .The Chicago letter of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. said: "Market here was very quiet.
Weather is unsettled throughout the. West
with showers generally predicted for the next
twenty-four hours. It being Saturday there
was considerable covering of shorts, which
narrowed tbe September and July spread.
Fair exoort business was done anil' there . was
fairly gqod commission house buying on the
soft spots. As the recent pressure has been
almost wholly speculative, the weather at the
moment is the important factor. Our advices
from what we resard the best source in tbe
Northwest indicate the probable certainty of
an important shortage in the acreage of spring
wheat. Professional 'traders are, .however,
up to the point, rather Inclined to discredit
this. Southwest advices are conflicting; we
are Inclined to think present Indications are
that the winter wheat crop will be 75,000.000
to 100,000,000 bushels under last year, the
shrinkage beliur. mainly "In the Southwest.
There is probably a moderate Increase ln
farmers'- deliveries, in that section, but noth
ing Important. There will be -no Liverpool
market till Wednesday. Northwest â¢ stocks
ifhow large decrease and the visible on Monday
will likely do the same."
This market was firm, but not materially
changed, . either on or off call. Holders- are

PERSONAL MENTION.
Before the riot was ended three officers
had been killed, one citizen had fallen
with a rifle in his hands, four negroes
were killed and many others were wound
ed. During the whole affrav at least 300
Ebots were fired. Citizens had joined the
police, armed with shotguns and rifles.
After the burned body of the negro was
found an angry crowd of white men
seized it and bore it toward the city.
Chief Ball threw a cordon of police across
the street at tfee city limits and took the
body away from the crowd and had it
sent into the city in a wagon. â¢ i
While the procession was passing Wll- Â¦
liara Gregg, a negro, was beard to re
mark that it whs a thair.e to kill negroes
that way and he had po sooner spoken
the words than he was riddled with bul
lets. He was carried to the county Jail,
where he died to-night.
Fifty men of the Fifth Infantry did
patrol duty in the disturbed district all
day, beings relieved to-night by the Gate
City Guards. As a further protection
Governor Candler to-night ordered every
militiaman in Atlanta under arms and to
remain at the company headquarters until
further orders. Order, has been restored
and Governor Candler declares that no
unoffending negro will be molested. j
The torch was finally brought Into re- I
QUlsltion, and mid the flames was heard !
the crack or rifles. The flames accom
plished what the bullets failed to do. Two .
members of the gang rushed out to death.
&nd the other, the leader, was burned
after bis body had been riddled with bul- ,
lets.
In the barricaded store were three ne
groes. The store was a small arsenal. In
which were a number of rifles and a small
catling gun. It was a rendezvous for a
gang of thieves and murderers. Within
were sharpshooters, 'who picked off men
on the outside. Every time a man showed
himself he was shot to death.
ATLANTA, May 17.â An effort by offl- j
cers of the law to arrest negro outlaws J
who had barricaded themselves in a store
resulted to-day In a riot in which eight j
men were killed, including three police- !

&nd six persons, black and white, were ;
wounded. An entire block of buildings ',
was burned before the conflict, which be
