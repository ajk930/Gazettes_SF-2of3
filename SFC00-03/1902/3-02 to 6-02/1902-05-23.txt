There are several other prominent Dem
ocrats who have had experience in Cub*
who may be enlisted in the party's ser
vice. Senator James K. Jones, chairman
of the National Democratic Committee,
with Senator Money of Mississippi, are
now in Cuba and they may be able to
throw some additional light upon the sub
ject when they return.
It is said that detectives, expert ac
countants and persons familiar with the
Spanish language and Cuban customs are
to be employed by the committee. One
of the names suggested is that of Repre
sentative Slayden of Texas, who speaks
Spanish fluently and who made an ex
haustive exploration of the island about
a year ago.
WILL PROBE FOR FRAUD.
The mattter, after being discussed by
the Congressional Commictee, has been
kept very quiet, but it is said that a
committee of prominent
members will be appointed and sent to
Cuba.
The fact that the War Department has
ordered all records of occupation brought
to Washington and held under lock and
key does not daunt the Democratic in
quisitors. All they need to know now
is that the revenues of Cuba, amounting
to a great many millions of dollars, have
been expended with lavish hand in the
island; that there has been one great
scandal .. In. 'â connection with the postr.1
revenues: that contracts for millions
have been let to Americans for the sew
ering and 'paving of Havana and for
similar work at Santiago de Cuba; that
enormous allowances have been made
out of Cuban funds for living expenses
of American officials, and, %s one Demo
crat put it to-day, "the island has been
under practically military despotism, re
sponsible \o no one, for several years."
RECORDS ARE LOCKED UP.
The committee reasoned that it would
be Impossible to make any Investigation
so long as Brigadier General Wood wa3
supreme in the island, but now that the
Cuban Government has been established
they think they will have no difficulty in
uncovering all the secrets of the Ameri
can occupation.
What the committee Is doing will not
be admitted by its members, but it is
known that campaign managers areÂ»
hopeful of finding an issue that will
eclipse the "water cure."

It is impossible for assistance to

acle can save them from the awful
death' which confronts them: These
unfortunates are at Grande
Riviere. They were cut off from
escape when Mont Pelee resumed
its labors Monday. The lavq that
burst from the volcano swept away
all the roads, filled the river chan
nels so that it set the bridges afloat,
carrying them upon its surface un-
. the existence of the entire
island of Martinique. Without
cessation it has been, in eruption
since Monday. A new crater has
opened on the north side of the vol
cano, and from this lava pours in
a broad stream down to the sea.
This crater is probably the result of
the terrific explosion that occurred
early Tuesday morning, zvhen the
pent up forces seemed to, rend .the
mountain from base to summit. It
is now known that there has been
further loss of life, and, what is
more distressing,' a large number of
persons, mostly \ women and chil

whose parents were victims to the
rage of Pelee.
It is probable that some of the
provisions intended for Martinique
will come here. Fea.rs are ex
pressed that a pestilence will result
from the bodies that -float ashore on
all the islands. Scores of burned
and lacerated bodies have floated
ashore on Marie Gallante Island,
south of here. They are being
burned and precautions have been
taken to prevent an outbreak of
disease;
A relief committee has been
formed here, and the authorities are
doing their. utmost' to relieve the.dis
tress. Free rations have been dis
tributed, but the supply. will not last
long.
"Similar conditions prevail in many
other towns In the anthracite coal fields.
The operators must keep the pumps going
or invite damage beyond all calculations
with the probability that months or years
would be required before the mines could
again be worked."
"All these subterranean passages are
connected at some point and if the pumps
stop In any of'the mines the water will
certainly get beyond control In the others
and a great calamity would occor This
entire city is undermined and fears have
frequently been expressed that there
would be a serious cave-in. With
the tunnels turned into rivers sweeping
aside the props and timbers, there would
be danger that the city buildings would
suddenly collapse.
"There are eighteen collieries within a
radius of nine miles of here," said an
official of the mine workers, familiar
with the local situation. "Their shafts
and tunnels extend under Wilkesbarre
and the. neighboring towns of Mill Creek,
Parsons, Miners Mills, Plains, Ashley,
Sugar Notch and, Warrier Run, with a
total population of possibly 200,000.
DANGER OF A FLOOD.
It is by no means certain that the vast
body of union men now in idleness can be
held in restraint for any prolonged period.
There may be radical defections at any
moment when work is resumed in any lo
cality, and only fear will hold back the
dissatisfied.
Already sporadic acts of violence have
appeared, but until to-day nothing actu
ally serious occurred. At New Philadel
phia, however, early this morning twenty
masked United Mine Workers entered a
miners' boarding-house kept by Mrs. Car
olina Fogerty. The band was armed and
gained entrance by breaking a window.
A ncn-union miner, Thomas Creassen, was
taken from his bed and bound hand. and
foot Then a rope was placed about ,'thj
young man's neck and he was lowered
from the upper window, several shots be
ing fired to intimidate the other boarders!
Creassen was saved from the terrible fate
which awaited him by some friends in the
lower story pulling him in their window
and cutting the rope.
ACTS OF VIOLENCE.
The miners also see that an attempt will
be made by the operators to replace the
pump workers who leave with non-union
men. As this course must Inevitably pre
cipitate trouble the mine â¢workers assume
that the operators will at the same time
throw down the gauntlet and make the
attempt of resuming work throughout the
collieries, involving a bitter struggle for
mastery, with the certain prospects of
violence and the marching of union
armies against the 'renegades or non
union foes.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., May 22.â Both
sides in the gTeat coal fight are forming
in line for trouble. That violence must
eventually come seems inevitable. The
operators are angry and the miners are
defiant. President Mitchell's demand that
engine drivers, flremen^and pumpmen be
paid the same wages for eight hours'
work that they now are paid for that of
ten will be resisted. The miners them
selves do not expect it to be granted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The railroads brought crowds of people
to Longview Junction, where they board
ed the Texas and Pacific fast train, which
does not ordinarily stop at Lansing. The
engineer was forced, at the point of a
Winchester, to stop at the scene of the
lynching, however, 'and the mob disem
barked.
Section Foreman McKee, husband of the
woman assaulted, applied the match to
the faggots. Many women were present
from the surrounding country, but owing
to the great crush they had very little op
portunity to see the negro until the heat
forced the crowd to widen the circle and
the flames leaped over him.
From the time the first fire was applied
to the negro's body until the dying embers
alone were left, the crowd yelled and
cheered for the men who. had chased the
negro.
HUSBAND LIGHTS PYRE.
Mrs. McKee was brought to the scene In
a carriage, accompanied by four other
women, and an effort was made to get the
carriage close enough for her to see the
negro. The crowd was so dense, however,
that this was impossible. Persons held
each other on their shoulders, taking
turns about looking at the awful sight
The negro's head 'finally dropped and the
ties were piled around and over him. In
half an hour only the trunk of his body
remained. As soon as the heat would per
mit, the crowd, with long sticks, began a
grewsome search for relics. Parts of his
skull and body were gathered up by some
and carried away. As the fire died down
the crowd took the two men who first
caught the negro and held them over their
heads, while they held their Winchesters
In their hands and were photographed.
WOMEN" SPECTATORS.
Morgan confessed to having committed
the crime and after he had been securely
chained to the stake, or rail, with his
hands and legs free, the members of the
mob began to take the railroad ties from
the fire -already started and burn out
his eyes. They then held the redhot and
burning timbers to his neck, and after
burning his clothes off, burned other parts
of his body. The negro screamed. He
was tortured in a slow and painful man
ner, the mob clamoring for a slow death.
The negro, writhing and groaning, begged
piteously to be shot
The prisoner was Identified by Mrs.
McKee and several negroes who worked
on the section with Morgan. Mrs. McKee
said they had the right man and the
negro was escorted by about 200 men,
armed with Winchesters, to the place of
execution. As he was chained to the
stake 5 he made a statement j- to -wjjilch he
implicated another negro named Franklin
Heard, saying Heard was to get part of
the money which" was to be stolen.
CONFESSES THE CRIME.
When it was learned that the negro
was captured and was being taken to
Lansing the excitement of the people
knew no bounds. By 11 o'clock this morn
ing great crowds had gathered at the
Lansing switch and arrangements were
made to burn , the negro. Just before 11
o'clock the train bearing the prisoner and
his captors arrived in Marshall and was
met by a great crowd of people. Many
boarded the train at Hallville and when
It arrived at Lansing every available
place on it was occupied. Waiting at
Lansing was another large crowd from
Longview and the surrounding country.
The negro was not taken from the train
on the side where the crowd was and
when the engineer started to pull out sev
eral Winchesters were leveled at him and
others of the train crew. They were told
if they moved the train an Inch they
would all be killed.

Miller is too bewildered and grief-
Etrlcken to make any statement. The two
Miller children were pronounced fatally
Injured. Barber is in great pain, and
while his left hand apparently must be
amputated, he has a fair chance of re
covery- Goodyear, who was dressing
when the explosion occurred, will soon re
cover. Coroner Thomas Greene is at the
scene. The Deltlte Powder Company's
loss is about $17,000 and uninsured. Mrs.
Miller was the daughter of H. C. Howard
of Igo.
Barber makes the statement that Miller
lighted a cigarette In the basement The
gas there Ignited and set off twenty tons
of deltite and explosive material. ' The
concussion occurred above him and for
this reason he was not hurt.
In the wreck of the mill lay George
Barber with his left hand and wrist
mangled and skin and flesh burned from
his back. James Goodyear was freed
from under the fallen beams of the bunk
house, and though burned and hurt, he
was able to limp away. The trees on all
Eides were uprooted and fallen and bent
Into fantastic shapes. The dead bodies
were laid upon a grassy plat and the in
jured ones soothed by friends and re
moved to Delta.
EMPLOYES IN RUINS.
A fearful scene of destruction greeted
their eyes. The plant and all the cabins
and houses in the gulch had been de
molished and the pieces scattered. George
Miller was seen struggling out of the
debris which filled the basement. He was
dazed and weak, but absolutely unhurt.
He was led away and the rescuers turned
to bis home. The walls had been shot
away and the roof had fallen to the
ground. Beneath It lay the frightfully
mangled corpse of Mrs. Miller and close
by the crushed body of her babe. The 4
year-old boy was found unconscious, with
his skull crushed. His older sister lay
bleeSlng. but still breathing.
At 8 o'clock Miller went down into the
basement. A few moments later Barber
heard a peculiar hissing sound and started
to run. As he reached the door a terrible
explosion occurred and the fragments of
the plant fell upon him at the spot to
which he was hurled. The mighty explo
sion was heard for many miles. It shook
like an earthquake the houses at Delta,
three miles away, and terrified the people.
Then they realized that the powder works
had blown up and parties with first re
lief supplies drove at a run over the trail
to the place.
SHOCK TiTTTE EARTHQUAKE
Miller smoked many cigarettes and sev
eral days ago Superintendent Orwiler saw
him smoking in the powder factory. A
severe warning was not heeded and Miller
repeated the offense. Both General Man
ager Steele and the superintendent were
absent early this morning when Miler
and George Barber went to work. James
Gocdyear lay asleep in the bunkhouse
fifty yards awaj\ Miller's wife and chil
dren were in their house.
The plant closed for the winter and
opened up four weeks ago to fill large
orders for the powder for mining: and toll
road companies under the superinten
dence of Charles Orwiler. Steele made
his; headquarters at Delta. Several men
have been employed and twenty tons of

TONS OF EXPLOSIVE.
The Deltite Powder Works were situ
ated on McCall Gulch, three miles above
Delta and forty-five miles up the canyon
from Redding. The plant was established
last year by Everard Steele, an inventor
of San Francisco, and his associates.
They manufactured a new explosive
known as "deltite,'" and more powerful
even than dynamite.

S5 years, a farmer, miner and powder

The refugees who were landed at this
place had, as a rule, nothing with them
but the clothes they wore when they left
Fort de France and they are now 'sup
ported by public funds or private sub
scriptions. ...
j The steamers at Fort de France kept" .a
large number of people on board until
evening, when the phenomena subsided
and most of the refugees were put ashore
On Tuesday steamers took away the des
titute people, who remained on board, and
also a number of paying passengers.
Three hundred refugees were landed here
and 1500 were taken to the island of Guad
eloupe.
"The panic-stricken people rushed out
of their houses, some making for the
mountains In the interior of the island
aiid others seeking to escape on board
the shipping In port.
"The scene was one of the wildest con
fusion. Whole families assembled on the
Jetties and alongvthe beach, nearly all of
them falling on their knees and scream
ing forth appeals for boats to take them
to the steamers, to which Bome of the
men swam off." - . .
The commencement address was made
by the Rev. W. K. .Beans, D. D., of the
First Methodist Church in Sacramento
His theme was "Getting Up in the
World." He took his text from the
Bible, "And Jesus increased in wisdom
and in favor with God and man." He
said culture was three-fold, physical
mental and spiritual. - A strong, health
ful and well-developed body, with a
trained and disciplined mind, and a heart
lcyal, loving and obedient to God, is the
shining ideal. Ignorance, idleness and
sinfulne3S. kept- men. down. He advised
tions became louder. Councilor Labat
related thrilling stories of escapes from
the environs of St. Pierre, which he
gathered from refugees. â¢ . .
"On Saturday, at 3 in the afternoon,"
he said, "an incessant rain of ashes ob
scured the sky, and at 5 o'clock total
darkness prevailed. The population gen
erally was unnerved. Sunday was light
er, but the ash rain continued with an oc
casional fall of lava, slag and pumice,
and continuous rumblings from the moun
tain, and the feeling of anxiety continued.
"At 5:30 a. m. on Monday a singular
phenomenon was witnessed in the eastern
sky. Clouds like gigantic white ostrich
plumes rose high in the heavens. . They
had luminous linings, which were mistak
en for flames, though they were only
caused by the rays of the rising sun, and
threw .the people into consternation.
"At noon the sea began to recede with
a heavy ground swell, tossing the ship
ping so severely that vessels broke from
their moorings. Then a long, rolling
wave spread over the sea front. It did
little damage, however, and. the sea again
receded and left a considerable area of
the shore permanently uncovered. At the
sarne time the ash rain became twice as
violent and pebbles fell. They were fol
lowed by pieces of heavy rock, some of
which weighed from three to twelve
pounds each.
A violin solo. "Hungarian Fantasio"
(Hubay), by Professor Henry L. Bett
man, opened the exercises. The Rev.
Francis , Reid, '87, gave the â¢ invocation.
Piano solos. "Etude de Concert" (Liszt)
and "Polonaise" (Douillet), were rendered
by Dean Pierre Douillet.
The commencement exercises began this
morning at 11 o'clock in the Conserva
tory of Music. The stage was .banked
with potted plants and flowers, and red,
white and blue streamers from either side
formed a knot "in front of the platform.
Upon the stage were the graduating

more of a gala occasion than usual, as

extent of $61,000 were burned, and the in

SAN JOSE, May 21.â The fifty-first
annual commencement exercises
of the University of the Pa
cific were held at College Park
This afternoon the exercises were of a
semi-business nature and were congratu
latory of the condition of the university.
They were opened by singing. The Rev.
A. R. Willis of Santa Rosa offered a
prayer.- H. B. Heaeock, the secretary of
the trustees, said $61,000 indebtedness had*
been wiped out by subscriptions raised in
the last year. While they had Intended to
burn the mortgages, on after-thought
they concluded to keep them and file
them away in the archives. The school
was absolutely free from debt, and steps
had been taken to secure an income' of
$3000 per year by subscriptions. The plan
was for sixty men to . give $50 each, and
already ten men had come forward. This
with the income of the school would put
the institution on a solid footing. J.. R.
Lewis delivered an address and Miss
Nella Rogers rendered a vocal solo. Brief
addresses were made by Mrs. R. L. Hig
gins, Mrs. Lulu Blanchard, Jere Lelter
and T. C. MacChesney. W. J. Hiiies ren
dered an original song.
The alumni reunion and banquet was
held this evening, and there was also a
reception at President McClish's home.
A musical and literary programme was
rendered at the reunion, after which a

PANTC AT FORT DE FRANCE.
The recent rains of ashes and volcanic
rocks which have fallen here caused so
much consternation among the inhabi
tants of Fort de France that those who
have not left the city are anxious to do
so, and large numbers are emigrating to
the Island of Guadeloupe, where it is now
estimated here 1200 people from Martin
ique have already sought shelter.
During her last exploring trip about the
island the French cruiser Suchet, which
did not stop at St. Pierre, noticed that all
the formerly cultivated land between
Grand Riviere and Marigot has been com
pletely destroyed. The Inhabitants of
those two towns have suffered and arc
still suffering a great deal, but they have
not yet determined to abandon those lo
calities and efforts are being made to sup
ply them with provisions.
"Our descent from the mountain was
more difficult than our ascent. A blinding
rain of ashes fell upon us and the engi
neer was nearly killed by a large stone
which fell near him. We succeeded in
reaching Basse Pointe on our return,
after having been four hours on the
mountain under the most dangerous cir
cumstances."
"The rims of the crater have very much
changed in appearance. The heat where
we stood was intense and the whole as
pect of the mountain was terrifying.
"Stones fell around us and we picked up
large pieces of sulphur, which, however,
we were unable to retain. The whole spot
was charged with electricity, which be
came so violent that we were obliged to
retreat.
without difficulty, and was able to ascer
tain that the present crater is about 300
meters in diameter. On the east it is
overlooked by Morne la Croix, the cul
miuating point of the Island, having an
altitude of 1250 meters, which Is complete
ly crumbled as a result of the volcanic
action and might easily collapse. The
Morne. Petit Bon Homme has an Incan
descent aspect.
"In order to make known our presence
at the point where we stood, I waved a
piece of white cloth, attached to a stick,
in the air, which was replied to. by a cor
responding signal from an inhabitant nf
Morne Rouge, who signaled in this man
ner In order to show that he saw us.
"We felt a number of electric commo
tions and our shoes were damaged by the
heat. The pond, which was situated hear
Morne la Croix, is completely dried up.
The iron cross which stood at the foot of
the mountain has been melted. Only the

stood and the lower part of the foot of

After brief exchanges the entire party
proceeded to the East room, where the
reception by President Roo3evelt was
heloV' The President was * accompanied
by Miss Alice Roosevelt and Miss Carew,
a relative of Mrs. Roosevelt. Grouped
about the President were members of his
Cabinet and other distinguished officials,
many accompanied by ladies. As tHe
French Embassador 'Â¦ presented each of
the official guests the President gave
him a warm grasp of the hand and spoke
a few words of felicitous welcome. On
both sides there were many expressions
of international good will and of last-
Ing friendship between the two republics.
This afternoon the United States naval
yacht Sylph took the party to - Mount
Vernon, where two Interesting cere
monies occurredâ the planting of a tree
brought from the battlefield of Yorktown,
where . Rochambeau and - Lafayette
snared the fortunes of war with Wash
ington, and the laying of a beautiful
wreathion the tomb of Washington. ' -. :
The carriages, about a dozen in num
ber, wheeled into Pennsylvania avenue
and proceeded to the White House,
where Count Rochambeau and his party,
Ambassador and Mme. Cambon and
others waited to greet them and where
at 10:30 o'clock President Roosevelt offl
cially received the party in the East
room. . . -. .
An interesting event-of the evening was
the presentation to Mrs. " Roosevelt of a
rare collection of sketches and engrav-.
ings, a gift from the Premier of the
French Cabinet,; M. Waldeck-Rousseau.
The remaining members of the- notable
party sent to represent the French Gov
ernment at the ceremony of - unveiling
the Rochambeau statue arrived here
over the Pennsylvania road at 10 o'clock
from Annapolis. Troop G of the Second
Cavalry, from Fort Myer, was drawn up
in front of the station and saluted on
the appearance of the visitors. Assist
ant Secretary of State Pierce entered the
first of the open carriages in waiting with
the ranking members of the party, and
several members of the French em
bassy also acted as escort.
During the dinn'er President Roosevelt
proposed the toast, "To the President of
the French Republic and to the People
of France." Embassador Cambon gave
the toast, "The President of the United

The mental strain becoming unendur
able, the Topaz was got ready at 3 a. m.,
the refugees hurriedly went on board
and started for St. Lucia, At 2 p. m. the
party having placed their families in
safety, returned by the Topaz to Marti
nique.
In the meantime telegrams were being
sent from Martinique imploring that a
steamer might be chartered to bring
away terrified people from St. Pierre.
But the superintendent of the Royal Mail
Company at Barbadoes would not allow
one of the coasting boats, the onjy
steamer available, to go to Martinique.
At a little before 5 p. m. cable communi

Estates and buildings were covered by
the fiery wave, which appeared to rise
to a height of some twenty feet over an
area of nearly a quarter of a mile. When
the torrent had poured itself into the sea
It was found that the Guerin sugar fac
tory, situated on the beach near the
mouth of the Riviere Blanche, some five
miles dista-nt from the mountain and two
from St. Pierre, was entirely embedded
in lava, the tall chimney alone being vis
ible. The burning mass of liquid had
taken only three minutes from the time it
was first perceived to reach the sea, four
miles away. Then a remarkable phenom
enon occurred. The sea receded all along
the we7t coast for a distance of about a
hundred yards and returned with great
ptrength, covering up the whole of the
Bea front of St. Pierre and reaching the
first houses on the Place Berlin. This
created a panic and the people ran terror
stricken toward the hills. Though the sea
receded again, without any great damage
being done ashore or afloat, * the panic
continued, intensified by the terrible de
tonations which broke from the moun
tain at short and irregular intervals, ac
companied by dense emissions of smoke
and lurid flashes of flame. This was aw
ful in daylight, but when darkness fell it
was more terrible still, and at each mani
festation of the volcano's anger people in
their night clothes, carrying children and
guided by any sort of lamp or candle they
had caught up in their haste, ran out into
COVERED BY FIEBY WAVE.
At about 9 a. m. on the morning of the
6th a private telegram was received from
Martinique, advising that the Plissoneau
family had chartered the steamer Topaz,
one of the boats of the Compagnie Girard,
and had started for St. Lucia at 5 a. m.
At about 11 o'clock the Topaz arrived
with Mrs. Plissoneau, Mr. and Mrs. Jo
seph Plissoneau and three children, Mrs.
Pierre Plisonneau and child, Mr. and

They report that at noon on Monday,

denly rushed down the southwestern
slope of the mountain and following the
course of Riviere Blanche, the bed of

had overwhelmed everything which ob
structed it? tremendous rush to the sea.
Nothing happened, however, and on
Monday morning. May 5, although every
thing was not quite serene, the aspect
was decidedly encouraging. Less excite
ment prevailed.
A very anxious morning was passed at
Martinique May 4. Thanks, however, to a
sea breeze from about 11 a. m., the situa
tion then appeared better, but as the
breeze died away at sunset a large quan
tity of ashes again began to fall and the
mountain and its environs presented a
most dismal spectacle, causing much
alarm as to what the night would bring
forth.

to-day. The following are ex
tracts from the Voice of St. Lucia, printed
at Castries, St. Lucia, May S: Mount
Pelee in the last days of April began to
show signs of uneasiness. On May 3 it
began to throw out 'dense volumes of
smoke and at midnight belched out
flame*, accompanied by rumbling noises.
At 5:30 a. m. flames were again visible
and similar noises were audible. At the
foot of Mont Pelee are the villages of LÂ©
Precheur and St. Philome. The Inhabi
tants were thrown into tne greatest-con
sternation by the sights and sounds of the
laboring mountain, especially by the
darkening of the sky by volumes of thick
smoke and the clouds of aches which be
gan to fall. There was an exodus from
all the districts. The town of St. Pierre
was, on the morning of last Saturday,
covered with a layer of ashes about one
quarter of an inch thick and appeared as
though enveloped in a fog. The mountain
was invisible, being wrapped in the smoke
which issued from it. The greatest
anxiety prevailed and all business was
suspended.

better disposed toward American mission

of 12,000 people at the Methodist church in

ate Committee on the Philippines to-day.
He said the American occupation of the
Philippines was an act of God - and it
should be continued. This led' to, quite a
long line 'of questions by Senator Patter

whether the occupation- of Cuba was an
act/Of -God; 'and when he replied:. in the
affirmative, ' Senator Patterson asked if.

An amendment to the rules was adopted
requiring that conference reports should
be printed in the Congressional Record
before being presented to the House.
The House disagreed to the amendments
of the Senate to the omnibus public build
ing bill and.it was sent to conference.
WASHINGTON, May 22.â The House .to
day resumed discussion of the immigra
tion bill. Almost the entire day was
t aken up with the amendment offered
by Underwood of Alabama, requiring an
educational test for immigrants to this
country. It was adopted.
An Educational Test.
Teller of Colorado delivered a speech In
the nature of a history of the legislative
proceedings through which the new Cu
ban republic was erected.
Spontaneous applause swept over, the
Senate and the galleries at the conclusion
of the speech. Such a demonstration is
very unusual on the floor of the Senate.
So pronounced was It that the presiding
officer called the attention of Senators to
the rule prohibiting any expression of ap
proval or disapproval.
Hoar confined himself closely to his
manuscript. .He denounced the attitude
of the Government in the Philippines as
ono of the most wicked and foolish chap
ters in American history. He urged that
the United States should withdraw from
the Philippines and permit the people
there to erect their own government, as
had been done in Cuba. He sharply ar
raigned General Funston for the methods
ho pursued in the capture of Aguinaldo,
and intimated strongly that had the Sen
ate been aware of the facts Funston
might not have been confirmed In his re
cent promotion. He hoped that, as the
irrevocable step had not been taken by
the United States, better counsels would
yet prevail and that this Government
would leave the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, May 22.â A notable
contribution to the discussion of the Phil
ippine question was made in the Senate
to-day by Hoar of Massachusetts. Hla
views on the subject are well understood,
but his expression of them to-day was
profoundly interesting and even Impres
sive. When the venerable Senator began
to speak every Senator at the Capitol
was in his seat, and for the two hours
and a half his address consumed he was
accorded the most careful attention not
only by his colleagues on the floor, but
also by the people in the thronged gal
leries.

WASHINGTON, May 22.-The Commit
tee on Rules of the House/by. ~ strict
party vote, decided to-day to give a day
for the consideration of the Corliss Pa
cific Cable bill and to report a rule to
that effect. No time-was set for the con
sideration of this bill, as it will take its
place at the foot of special orders, which
take precedence by reason of previous re
port. Richardson and Underwood, the
Democratic members of the committee,
opposed the rule for the reason that the
Democratic members on the Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
were opposed to the' bill. The rule when
reported will provide that amendments
are germane to the bill which will throw
the entire subject of international cable
into -the House for consideration. It is
expected that the bill will" be' called up
the last part of next week, previous spe
cial orders having the right of way.
Three days will be given to the consid
eration; of the Newlands irrigation bill,
two days for general debate - and one
day under the five-minute rule.- The com
mittee was unanimous in not only bring
ing in the rule, but. the length of time
the- irrigation bill 'should be considered.
It is expected that .the irrigation bill will
be reported the first' week in June.

Professor Hilgard of the University of
California has issued a statement con
cerning the coloring of olives. He has
found that there was a belief that bluish
black fruit was In demand. He has given
information that the Iea3t objectionable
way to color olives is with a very small
amount of copperas or sulphate of Iron,
and he has assured himself that even the
most delicate digestion was not disturbed
by the minute amount of iron so intro
duced into the system. In the olive tha
Iron becomes insoluble after it has reach
ed the remaining tannin in the fruit and
is imperceptible to the taste.
Professor Hilgard claims that he is not
responsible for "dire effects claimed to
have been produced by the Los Angeles
olives," and says that what mistakes
were made in coloring accidentally or
purposely he can only conjecture. Those
who claim to have suffered at his hands
will find that a great service has been
done them, he says, in enabling them to
market freely, hereafter, olives in their
natural condition after pickling, instead
of being "held up" by the grocer. He
desires that no fruit shall be handled that
has not been approved by a Board of
Health.

LOS ANGEL.KS.
LOS ANGELES, May 22.â With eleven
hits off Glendon, Los Angeles scored only
two runs, while San Francisco made five
circuits of the bases on eight hits. It was
a. slow, uninteresting game, which Los
Angeles should have won at any one of
half a dozen stages. 5But her batters failed
to connect when hits meant runs._/ House
holder's muffing a hard drive in the first
inning was costly. The Seraphs played
without any of their accustomed ginger.
Toman played a brilliant game at short
and Slagle's pitching was of the best sort.

and his batting eye gave promise of

'OAKLAND.
The first part of the trouble was, a
Â¦hummer. It bubbled and boiled over with
that heartrending quality of baseball
which causes the. nervous fan to hand his
neighbor an occasional jolt in the region
of the solar plexus. Toward the close,
however, the Senators took a good lead.
Lohman's bunch were attacked by frozen
extremities and never seemed to get into
the game with the proper spirit.
Dowling hurled them over for Fisher for
six innings, when he began to show signs
-of increasing wildness and was replaced
by Doyle. Dowling was unsteady through
out the entire time he served, and but for
good luck in several tight places. would
surely have lost his' game.
The sixth round was just like the battle
of Waterloo for those Oakland lads. Up
to that time they had the score 2 to 0,
with apparently more in sight, when, by
a combination of two errors and five safe
bumps, the forms of five husky Statesmen
loomed up from among the bases and
came lumbering slowly but surely
toward that ever welcome spot on the
diamond â the home plate.
Oakland scored one in the first by two
timely singles. The second came in the
fourth on a two-bagger to the score
board by.Dunleavy, a pretty double steal
by Dunleavy and Francks and a fielder's
choice, Gorton hitting the ball to short.
Two more singles and a base on balls
gave Ewing's gents another in the sev
enth, which did them for the day.
'Â¦ Hogan's great catch of Walters' hard
drive to right in the second when two
were resting on the cushions and as many
gone to the bench was the best thing of
the game. Walters drove the ball to deep
right and Hogan made a grand sprint and
captured it just as it was about to touch
the ground. This saved the Senators two
runs and earned a whole lot of praise for
the San Jose ypungster, who is trying to
break into fast company. The score:
Several hundred sports, a few married
men 'and a sprinkling of fair ones wan
dered out to the Eighth-street lot yes
terday afternoon and were bunkoed.
They were unjust enough' to want
another nineteen - rounder and it came
not. ! They saw the - handsome Mr.
Biir Cristall in llvingr picture, poses and
he kept the game going the limit, a total
of 2 hours 20 minutes. Scoreâ Oakland 3,
Sacramento 5.
EDDIE SMITH WILL BEFEKEE.
George Murray walked up to Jack

went to the carpet building his eye. Alec
Greggair.s counted slcivly, bet Hurine was
beyond recall. The end was so sudden
the spectators thouglri Murray liad a
fcorseshoe in his glove for luck.
Frank Craig had "Sharkey" .Joice wob
fclir.g in the first rour<d, but could not
finish him. Craig show.ved rights to the
jaw, but Joice was too tvtrong. Near the
end of the second round he was sent to
the padding, but was saved by the gong.
In the third they wresrJed each other
down. Craig quit in the hist round.
Billy McDonald ended J"oe Kelly's as
pirations' in half a rounc. McDonald
sailed in at the tap of the g'ong and the
curtain fell in short order.
Jimmie Carroll was too fast for Joe
Reagan. The contest endued in the first
round.
The bout between Ernest Parker and
Jehn Crowe was a burletiqce. The boxers
would start each round -vKh a rush, and
alter sampling one another's punches
would stand off and aim. at each other.
The crowd would then try to egg them
oil, but they declined to tight. The bout
Â¦was replete with leng-distsnee swinging.
Crowe was given the tropfcj>.
Joe Carroll was awarded a decision in
his contest with Georgfc Handley. The
bout went four rounds, i*uÂ£ was devoid of

Gus Koster proved too much for Henry
Fincke, the amateur welter- weight cham

him. The men fought f.rona start to finish.

CAPTAIN L. SIEBE'S TEAM.
become famous as it did yester
day afternoon during the grand tourna
ment of the amateur sharpshooters of
the Germania Schuetzen Club. The sharp
shooters were divided into two teams.
One. captained by "Billy" Zinkand, con
sisted of Paul Steindorff, August Jung
blut. "Jim" Leahy, Joseph Fogarty and
W. L. Davis. The other had for its leader
Captain L. Siebe and was composed of
Ferris Hartman,' Nick- Ahrens, Joseph
Miller, A. G. Wieland and Harry Cash
man.
Captain Zinkand's team won by making
S36 points to Captain Siebe's 770. The
sharpshooters who composed the losing
team are inclined to believe Ferris Hart
man is responsible for their defeat. For
Hhe flrst live rounds Siebe's team led by a
good margin. Up to this point Hartman
had been shooting in a manner surprising
to all beholders, but when the sight of
victory was gladdening the eyes of his
team mates he suddenly let up in his good
work and scored several "gooses." The
losers believe he sold out to the enemy.
The feature of the day was the exciting
race between "Jim'' Leahy, Harry Cash
man and Ferris Hartman for the beauti
ful "Swinestein," offered as a prize to the
one who would succeed in missing the
target the most times. The race between
the three was very close, but Ferris
finally won out.
Protests have been filed against Paul
Steindorff and Joseph Muller on the
ground that they are professionals. Both
stoutly maintain they are amateurs in
grood standing. By reason of the high
score he made Steindorff was awarded
the championship. This he must defend
against all comers. The losers have chal
lenged the winners to another contest to
take place two weeks hence. On that oc
casion Hartman and Leahy will also have
a match race. "Teddy" claims that after
he has had time to rehearse he will chal
lenge Steindorff for the championship.
â¢AH the shooters who participated in thÂ«
tournament were awarded handsome
steins as prizes. The prizes were put up
by Fred Bushnell, "Jim" Leahy and Nick
Ahrens.

team were:

spector de la Torre yesterday, "has given me
two weeks' vacation, which I will devote to

To Inspect Northern Ports.
FROM. SEATTLE.
The schooner Alice McDonald arrived yes
terday, 210 days from Newcastle. Australia,
and sixty-two days from Pago Pago. Since
leaving Australia the McDonald has been
twice on the overdue list, was once reinsured
at 40 per cent and stood at 30 per cent only a
few days ago. Only one man, Frank Gardner,
the cook, remains of the crew that shipped In
Australia, The McDonald left Newcastle with
more than 1000 tons of coal on board. She put
into Samoa January 12. leaking, short of pro
visions and with the crew In a state of mu
tiny. Two hundred tons of coal were dis
charged and disposed of, the vessel was re
calked and the voyage resumed. Before sail
was made, however, the crew refused duty.
The McDonald was taken in tow by the U. S.
S. Abarenda and the mutineers sent here for
trial. The men were dismissed. The McDon
ald was towed to Pago Pago, where she re
mained until Captain Hardwlck and a new
crew reached there from this port. The voyage
here from Pago Pago was long and tedious and
would have lasted a month or eo longer, the
officers eay, but for a lucky spell of wind that
wafted them beyond the region of calms. The
McDonald Is a slow vessel and very much in
need of overhauling. She commenced leak
ing, the cook eays, only five days before Pago
Pago was reached. The leak was stopped with
out difficulty and there was no trouble of that
kind on the second half of the voyage. Her
masts are not in very good shape, and while
ehe is being overhauled her rig may be altered
to something- more In keeping with her size.
Christian Olsen, a sailor, aged 46. a native of
Norway, died April 10 and was buried at sea.
Alice McDonald Arrives.

THE EMPORIUM.On her return from Cuba Miss Alice Roosevelt
brought back a silver tipped cane, which she has car,
ried twice at White House garden parties, and it is
going to be the proper thing for every summer girl
to have one. It is Cuban, you know.
Senator Dolliver recently referred in debate to an

the grave Senators fully fifteen minutes to catch on
tc the fact that he was talking about Edmund

The Jiiunicipal authorities are expressing a hope
that the Hall of Justice may be finished in conformity
with the original plans. It may be possible, that the
City Fathers have in contemplation the erection of a
new building. No other explanation would justify
their hope. . ' *"."
Testimony at the Washington investigation of
Philippine affairs is to the effect that so great is the
stress of war upon Uncle Sam's soldiers that even in
their sleep they shriek "Get 'em, boys, get 'em." Per
haps the cry was an echo of an old one, "Got 'em,
boys; got 'em again."
It is stated that of the two highest prizes for ora
tory at Harvard only one will be conferred this year
because no student is worthy of the other; but while
Harvard cannot furnish two orators she has a full
set of athletes to compete for any sort of prize that
goes to muscle.
Russia- is well aware ot the meaning of the pro
posed road and has 'tried to block Â¦ the enterprise by
establishing herself on the Persian Gulf. Great Brit
ain has already planted her. power there. Germany
will move to the same point: with the new road, for
while it. is to be constructed under the. authority of
the Sultan it is" known that! it is to be virtually a
German road. /When the powers meet the concert of
Europe will be called upon to .arrange a basis of
agreement, and there seems no reason to doubt that
Â¦some peaceable arrangement can, be made. Then
will come' the commercial and industrial struggle for
the control of the > markets of China, and in that
struggle America will, have to take- part.. In the -end,
therefore, , this Bagdad railroad is going to .be a mat
ter of practical interest to. San Francisco. -
The mere reading of that formal perfunctory Te
port will revive recollections of the "Arabian Nights"
and the days, of the good Haroun Al. Raschid.
Bagdad, Bassorah and v Aleppo :are cities.; renowned
for many an adventure recorded in those oriental
tales. The development of the line, however, will be
a mightier marvel than any ever told in the thousand
and one nights. Big world politics are involved in
the construction of the work. It is not a matter of
railway traffic but of empires that the concession
deals with. The line from Marmora to the Persian
Gulf will hardly be completed before a line running
westward from British India will connect with it and
thus a southern route across Asia to compete
with the Siberian road. will be under way, and even
tually from India railways will jbe' carried into China
and the great through route of the south be com
pleted. . . . ; : .
The Consul says: "Beginning at Konieh and pass
ing through the plains and mountains of Caramania,
the new line will cross the Taurus chain, reaching
Adana and Mersine afte'r considerable engineering
difficulties. From that point the line will branch off
to Aleppo and the Euphrates and terminate at Bas
sorah after passing Mossoul, . Bagdad and Carbola.
The length of the line is 1553 miles,' and the duration
of the concession ninety-nine years. By means of
the route there will be regular and rapid communica
tion between the Sea of Marmora and the Persian
Gulf."
FOR : some time past very little has'been heard of
the 'Bagdad railway, though there was a time
, whe,n it interested all the v world and disturbed
a considerable part of it. in South Africa
and in China have of late distracted attention from
the rivalries of the nations in Syria, and men ceased
to concern themselves about railways in that part of
the world. The Governments interested, however,
have kept right along with their diplomacy and their
work, and now Consul Ravndal reports from Bei-ut
that an imperial irade has been issued definitely
granting the concession for the Bagdad railroad to
the Anatotia Railroad Company and that its con
struction is to be rapidly pushed forward.

The second display of exuberance is more notable
still. Ever since the annexation of Alsace and Lor
raine the people of those provinces have been kept
under a virtual dictatorship. The Governor of the
province has been clothed by law with extraordinary
powers, to be exercised whenever he chose. A good
many efforts have been made in the Reichstag to re
peal the dictatorial clause of the law,. but all such
attempts have failed. Now comes the Kaiser

made a display of affection hardly less strong than
that he manifests for us. One of thqse was toward
the Jews. It appears the old aristocracy of Germany
has always treated the Jews of the empire as a
necessary evil, to be tolerated but not approved. The
Kaiser has startled his court, therefore, by showing
a marked consideration for that class of his subjects.
He has not only invited Jews to dine at court on
special occasions, but he recently took four of them
as guests on his yacht for a pleasure trip. Nor is
that all. The Kaiser does nothing half way, and it
is said he has given intimations that he may appoint
some members of the Jewish race as members of his
Cabinet. ;'.'^vV
If from these manifestations of a longing to em
brace us we should reach the conclusion that the
Kaiser loves none but us we would deceive our
selves. The Kaiser's ardor is merely the Kaiser's
way. He is doing that sort of thing all the time.
When he talks of war he talks like a barbarian, but
when he talks of peace he talks like a lover. He is
never moderate. Whatever he does, he does with a
vim, vigor and exuberance that makes Roosevelt
look like thirty cents. We are fortunate to be the
recipients of some of his friendly bumptiousness, but
we are not the only puddles that his sun shines on. â¢
Certain proposals of a tentative nature have been
already put forward by his Majesty." He has re
quested us not to asspme too much sovereignty in
Sulu, where he himself claims some rights; and, fur
thermore, he has formally asked us to accord pro-;
tection to German interests menaced by the revolu
tion in Colombia.
All that was but the beginning of the Kaiser's
wooing. Immediately upon the return of his brother
the Kaiser informed the President that he intends to
present Columbia with a statue of Frederick the
Great, and. now comes the further report that when
the statue is in place his Imperial Majesty will send
the Crown Prince over to attend the unveiling.
When that has been done there will be left for the
Kaiser no further step in his wooing except to come
over in person and make his proposal in due form.
KAISER WILLIAM is assailing the tender af
fections of Miss Columbia with an ardor that
signifies something like "love me or I die."
First he gave an order for an American yacht, next
he invited the daughter of the President to launch
it, then he sent his brother to witness the launching
and to give the President a bust showing his imperial
self in marble calm. At the same time he presented
Harvard with a Teutonic museum, and as a touch of
winning courtesy advised the Prince to do kowtow
to American newspaper men, as they are "equal' to
his generals in command."
THE KAISER'S WAY.
A compilation of cities and towns that have re
ceived Carnegie libraries up to date shows that every
State in the Union is represented with the exception
of Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Mississippi, Rhode
Island and South Carolina. It is believed that those
six States will proceed to organize a mutual admira
tion society and be proud of themsejves. , ,
That the members of the police force are entitled
to an eight-hour working day is indisputable. That
an increased number of men will be required to make
the force adequate for the protection of the city is
also beyond dispute. It is therefore up to the Su
pervisors to provide the money needed to maintain
the required force working on the eight-hour sys
tem. That is the issue, and it should be met firmly
and feirl}\ If an increase in the liquor license be
deemed inadvisable, then some other means of in
creasing the revenue should be provided. In any
event an adequate police protection must be assured.
These suggestions, coming from the Chief of the
Police Department, who has long experience in
its work and is familiar with its needs, merit atten
tive consideration not only from the Supervisors but
from the people themselves. Suggestions coming
from the highest expert on the subject cannot be ig
nored.
Upon that showing an increase in the police force
becomes an imperative necessity. To maintain a
larger force there will be needed a larger revenue.
The Chief has thought of that phase of the question
and is ready with a suggestion as to the best means
of increasing the police fund. He says: "I can see
a way out of the financial difficulty and that is by in
creasing the liquor license. It is only $84 per year,
and I would urge that it be increased to $200, which
is low enough, considering the license in other cities.
As there are more than 3000 saloons here, it can
Teadily be seen to what extent the revenue would be
increased. The city is growing and we need thor
ough police protection, which can only be accom
plished by an adequately equipped force."
In adopting the eight-hour system, however, there
will be a decrease in the amount of police protection
given to the city. The Chief himself does not evade
the issue that will be raised by the change. He is
quoted as saying: "Even at present there are large
portions of the city without proper police protec
tion, and it will be much worse under the eight
hour system unless the force is increased. The men
will have to be divided into three platoons instead of
two, as at present, which means a reduction of
about 20 per cent for duty at one time."
CHIEF WITTMAN has announced that on
June 1 he will introduce the eight-hour sys
tem of patrol duty in the police service. No
cbjection can be made to that decision, for public
sentiment has long ago been formed in favor of an
eight-hour working day. The general industry of the
country is tending in that direction, and it is but
right the city should act in harmony with that policy
of the people.

The various organizations that recommended the
bill to Congress when it was first presented should
now send further appeals for its immediate passage.
When the session was young it was announced from
Washington that the bill was I among those with
which Congress would be sure to deal. That prom
ise was given at a time when fr6m every quarter of
the Union petitions in favor of it were being re
ceived by Congress. As soon as the people were as
sured of the passage of the measure they ceased to
petition, and straightway Congress seems to have
become indifferent.. It is time, therefore, to renew
the popular demand. The bill is a just one, the pub
lic service requires if, the people .favor it, and it is
the duty of Congress to enact it.
The bill merits the universal lndorsement.it has
received. It does no more than provide a just
recompense for a hard-worked and efficient body of
public servants. It is a measure which should have
been enacted Â¦ long ago. It might have been made
much more liberal' to the' mail carriers than it is and
still not gone beyond the limits of fair payment
for faithful work. The opposition to it cannot be
very strong numerically in either branch of Con
gress, for if it were the leaders would not hesitate
to refer it to the House and defeat it there. The
very fact that the fight against- the bill is made in
the committee-room and is secret is a proof that the
antagonism comes from no honest source, but from
men who have neither a valid reason for their ob
jection nor the courage to fight openly:' '
The measure is one of the few now before Con
gress' that has received well nigh unanimous sup
port from men of all parties and from all sections of
the country. It has been indorsed by the press,
recommended by Boards of Trade, Chambers of
Comme-ce and other commercial and" industrial
bodies, has received the approval of conventions
representing both political parties, and has been cor
dially commended by a large number of leading men
in Congress. In spite of all that, however, the Post
office Committee, holds back the bill and treats it as
if it were a matter of no moment or of no interest.
FOR reasons not apparent to the public the let
ter carriers' bill has been kept in the room of
the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads
in spite of urgent recommendations from all parts of
the country that it be .promptly reported to' the
House. It would seem to be the intention of the
opponents of the measure to shelve it in the com
mittee and so save themselves the odium of making
an open opposition to it That method of defeating
a much desired bill is one of the gravest defects of
the present system of . conducting the affairs of the
House, and it would not be a bad thing'for the pub
lic to make an issue upon this bill and see if the
committee cannot be forced to bring the bill before
the House and leave it for the majority to decide
whether or no it shall be adopted.
THE LETT ER CARRIERS' BILL.
HARRISON GRAY OTIS.
LYNCH'S POLITICAL SCHEMES.
It is quite well known in San Francesco
that S Lynch worked Vigorously to defeat
the election of State Senators Nelson and
Belshaw, although they were well-known
Republicans 7 and were regularly nomi
nated candidates of the Republican party
ln their respective districts. Senator Nel
son's affidavit, which was; placed before
the President/is as follows:
I. John H. Nelson. State Senator from the
Twenty-fifth Senatorial District of the State of
California, , do hereby declare that I was a
candidate of the Renublican party for the
office of. State Â¦- Senator from said district ln
the ' months of October ,' and j November, 1900,
ond was the regular . nominee of said party.
That bacauae of my opposition and the -stand'
of my friends against the/ruling machine

of the Republican ( party in San Francisco a
combination was made " in my district by the
said bosses with similar bosses of the Demo
cratic party In an effort .to defeat my election
and eecure. the election of , my, Democratic op
ponent, j behind . whom they \ massed all - their
strength. v Notwithstanding \the ,: fact . that my
Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦''Â¦. \ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
I submit that this is a plain case of official
stuffing, bordering hard on the domain of of
ficial faking; and if the President is Investi
gating the conduct of Mr. Lynch's office, and
Lynch" a fitness for the place, I believe these
facts should go before the President for con
sideration. ' Yours very truly, ; * ,
"On or about the middle of June, 1901, J. C.
Lynch, Collector of Internal Revenue at San
Francisco, said that he . was * within about
$30,000 or $40,000 of having collected $4,000,000,
and that he was going to see the large whole
sale dealers, and have' them take the amount
(shortage) less the $4,000,000,. so that his col
lections . would show the offlce to have done a
business of $4,000,000."
The statement* here made comes from a man
of my personal acquaintance, ' formerly an of
ficial of Lob Angeles County, whose word I
consider good. It is as follows:
In support of this statement and conclusion
I am â¢ at liberty to cite the statement of one
Â¦who heard Lynch himself say at that time that
he was intending to see a certain firm of whole
sale liquor dealers, whose names 1^ have, â¢ as
they had promieed to buy $35,000 or $40,000
worth of internal revenue stamps from Lynch' a
offlce ln advance of their actual requirements;
and that this purchase, together with another
purchase under like conditions, "Just brought
him (the Collector) within. the desired amount,
making his office* 'first class' within the mean
ing of the law." < : V
It will be found that the First California
District (Mr. Lynch's) was advanced to No.. 1
on the strength of two reports made by Special
Agent B. M. Thomas. There is warrant for
the assertion that the record was stuffed or
padded to meet a situation required by the
personal and political interests of John C."
Lynch and his backers and followers. That
is to say the scheme was to create a bogus
record in ! order to give Mr. Lynch a higher
though false standing with the department,
and this was done through his solicitation of
Â¦wholesale liquor dealers, brewers and cigar
makers, whom he induced "to buy enormous
amounts of revenue stamps in advance of their
requirements and at Just the time to serve
Mr. Lynch's purpose in making up his official
returns.
DEALINGS IN REVENUE STAMPS
Hon. Thomas R. Bard, U. S. Senate, Wash
ington, D. C. â Dear Sir: I have to place be
fore you certain facts bearing on the Internal
revenue offlce, San Francisco, and affecting the
official conduct of John C. Lynch, the Collector.
It appears that the status of the several In
ternal revenue districts of the country is fixed
by numbers, viz. : No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, ac
ccrding to the amount of money collected and
increase in business done, taking the figures at
the end of the fiscal year.
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 30, 1901.
Offlce of the Times-Mirror Company,
The letter of General Harrison Gray
Otis is surely readable. Â¦ Here is what he
wrote:
In view of declarations made by Sena
tor Perkins before he left the city for
Washington, and uttered ln the presence
of Senators Caldwell, Smith and Bel
shaw,' the foregoing letter from' Senator
Bard to the President places the senior
Senator .In a .very unfortunate position.
Perkins was not at variance with his col
league when he urged Stephen B. Kelley
to stay in the fight for the Collectorship.
It Js said that letters over the genuine
signature of George C. Perkins can be
produced as proof that the senior Senator
positively promised hla support to Kelley.
No wonder then that Senator Bard says
to the President: "The attitude of my col
league. Senator Perkins, in this matter
was not anticipated."
TH0MA8 R. BARD, U. S. S.
SENIOR SENATOR'S POSITION.
The attitude of my colleague, Senator Per
kins, in this matter, was not anticipated, but
on the contrary, I had expected that, while he
did not desire to Join me in the recommenda
tion that Mr.' Lynch- be removed by the ap
pointment of his successor, he would not go so
far m to protest against his removal, and even
to this day I understand that, if the President
decides to make the change, which I believe
ought to be made, Senator Perkins will be,
under such circumstances, entirely content if
Mr. Kelley shall be appointed. But ln view
of the fact that the two Senators from Cali
fornia appear to the President to be at
varfance in their views and wishes ln the
matter. I . fully appreciateâ If in the . opinion
of the President the charges filed by me, if
sustained, would be sufficient cause for the
removal of Mr. Lynchâ that it was necessary
for me to support the charges by sworn j| and
otherwise reliable testimony, such as has now
bnen submitted. Most of these affidavits are
ot recent date, and I have no doubt that many
others of a similar character can be readily
obtained If necessary. Yours
At the tame time there were placed in my
hands the separate affidavits of Senator John
H. Nelson and Charles Mayer, and the Joint
affidavits of J. R. Kirby, M. At Smith. George
F. Gasper. W. H. Nolan, Charles Engelke, . John
Reynolds, C. R. Franklin, Assemblyman Twen

gether -with letters of State Senator , A. A.
Caldwellof Riverside, dated January 14, 1902,
and General Harrison Gray Otis, dated Decem
ber SO. 1901,- both of which are addressed to
me, but aro evidently intended to be placed be
fore the President.
AFFIDAVITS AND LETTERS
It becomes my duty to submit also the in
closed separate affidavits of G < W. Blum,
James B. Sykes, A. M. Currie, Henry von
Â¦\Verthern. Norman W. Hall, Lincoln E. Sav
age, secretary of the Republican' Primary
Lee gue, and John W. Harney, all addressed to
the President, and showing that by particular
incidents set forth Mr. Lynch is an active polit
ical manager, and uses his offlce room, his
deputies and employes for promoting the inter
ests of a faction of the Republican party in
California.
Id regard to my recommendation that Hen.
John C. Lynch. Collector of â¢ Internal Revenue
at San Francisco, should not, for the reasons
given, be permitted to retain the offlce longer.
I am Informed that there have been submitted
to the President for his consideration the res
olution of the Republican Alliance of San Fran
cisco, protesting against the retention of Mr.
Lynch, and also a strong letter from Stata
Senator Morehouse to the same effect.

A. M. Currle, who was a delegate to
the Bepublican convention of 1901, makes
affidavit as follows:
That John C. Lynch, Collector of Internal
Revenue, was generally regarded as the leader
of a political faction and. was in consultation
with the local political leaders during tha
campaign. That on November 0, 1901, affiant
met John C. Lynch at the corner of Morton
and Kearny streets,' the day of the election,
and during the conversation Mr. Lynch made
the following remark: "I have put {500 of my
own money. into A. G. Flsk's fight. That is
my personal fight. Of course I am interested
in the other nominees, but A. G. Flak is my
personal fight. I requested Fisk's nomination
as a personal favor to me."
That on the 17th day of September, 1901,
on or about that day, John C. Lynch, in the
presence of C. \V. Blum and the affiant, made
the following statement: "I was so busy try
ing to straighten out the tangle of the Board
of Supervisors that I did not have time to see
Mr. Rlordan; chairman of the convention, un
til the convention was in full swing. Some
of the candidates for Supervisors who were
not on the programme were kicking and I was
kept busy trying to pacify them, and when I
did finally succeed in quieting them it was too
late to see Chairman Riordan." This last
statement was made In the office of the Collec
tor of Revenue in the Appraisers* building.
That within the affiant's knowledge Mr. Lynch
used . the office of Internal Revenue Collector
as a meeting place for local political and fac
tional leaders.
FISK "WAS THE MAN.
FIGHT AGAINST NELSON.
I am requested to state the truth as to the
attitude of Mr. John C. Lynch. Revenue Col
lector of this district, toward me in my cam
paign. I say that Mr. John C. Lynch and all
of his deputies made an active canvas3 and
campaign asainst me. One or more of his out
side { denutles visited numerous saloons and
barrooms in my district and used the influence
of their official positions to encompaÂ»s my. de
feat. During the last session of the Legisla
ture Mr. Lynch was continuously in attendance
in Sacramento and was very zealous fn sug
gesting and advancing legislation on various
subjects. He was there during the entire ses
sion and I am sure that he could scarcely have
been at his office at all in San Francisco from
the day the Legislature met until the day it
adjourned, some seventy days.
I have been repeatedly asked to certify these
facts and to Join in - a petition for hla re
moval.. I have never done so heretofore be
cause I did not wish an inference to be drawn
that I was hostile to Mr. Lynch's retention
and was asking for his removal because of my
personal feeling toward him arising from his
attitude toward me in the campaign. I have
no personal feeling aagainst Mr. Lynch, but I
am willing to state formally herein what al
most everybody in San Francisco, certainly
almost every one in -my district. Is entirely
familiar with.
In addition to the foregoing . I certify that
Mr. Lynch has personally admitted to me that
every one of the Republican officials and com
mitteemen who opposed me would be protected
by him, and he has carried out this statement
by securing the appointment of several of them
to lucrative positions in the employ "of the
State administration. This he has himself
admitted to me. Mr. Lynch Is recognized' as
the official dispenser of State patronage In San
Francisco.
I desire to add also that I have seen him in
attendance at and issuing directions at various
conventions of the Republican party, both
State and municipal. In the last municipal
convention he was especially active and from
him. was received the programme which re
sulted in the nomination of the recent Re
publican local ticket which 'was so overwhelm
ingly repudiated at the polls.
The foregoing statement of Senator
Nelson was sworn to on January 28, 1902.
When the President decided against
sending in the name of Stephen Kelley
to succeed John C. Lynch, Senator Bard
remarked: "I will then withdraw the
papers filed in the case." The President
at once objected to the withdrawal of the
papers, signifying very plainly that it was
his purpose to give the subject further at
tention. It is said that the President
knows very well that Senator Bard is
honorable and straightforward, having
the right on his side.

LINCOLN SAVAGE SWEARS.
The affidavit of Lincoln E. Savage, sec
retary of the Republican Primary League,
contains these statements:
That from the inception of the primary cam
paign, commencing June, 1001., ar.d closing on
the 13th of August of that year, John C.
Lynch was the leader of our political oppo
nents; that wlthlrf knowledge of affiant he met
at the Internal Revenue offlcn numbers of peo
ple and gave directions as to the conduct of
the. primary. That he was the acknowledged
leader of the opposing faction, and used hla
deputies and all the employes of his of lice
in active partisan politics. That it is a matter
of common report that he us'.-d his power aa
Internal Revenue Collector . for political pur
poses among the liquor dealcvs within h.s dis
trict, and endeavored to coerco them during: the
said primeary.
That at the last two sesslors of the Legis
lature, during his term of office, John C.
Lynch has been in almost constant attendance
as a lobbyist at the sessions of the Legisla
ture, and has been generally recognized as
such.
That said Lynch stated in afflanf s hearing
that A. G. Fisk. Republican candidate Â¦ for
District Attorney, was "his man," andN "that
that was his flsht." x

My Dear Senator: I have been expecting the
appointment of "a successor to John Lynch la
the Internal Revenue Collector's office in Sau
Francisco and have hoped that such â¢ action
would be taken by the President. My reason
Â»or wishing his successor to be appointed is
that during the last session of the Legislature
of which I am a member, Mr. Lynch wai
present nearly every day in the lobby, where
I was informed and believe he was working
in the interest of certain measures. I know
he was present in Sacramento and at the
Capitol durin* the time the ,friendÂ» of local
option attempted to pass a local option bill
I do not know of my own knowledge what biils
he worked for and what bills he worked
against, but it was generally reputed that h'3
presence Iff the lobby of the State Legislature
was to represent large corporation interests
Sacramento is outside Mr. Lynch's district
and I could account for his presence in the
lobby no other way than that he was doin^
politics.
You are at liberty to use this letter in what
ever way you desire. Very truly yours

"Too much bathing is harmful, as it tends to macera

sions put upon him
Such are some of the specific charges made against
the Warden. There are many others of a like na
ture varying in the degree of harshness alleged.
That some of the reports may be exaggerations is of
course likely, but so many of them come from re
liable sources it is impossible to meet any of them
with incredulity. They raise against the Warden
a suspicion which neither he nor his friends can
afford to ignore. Should the Prison^ Directors for
any reason hesitate to undertake an investigation it
would be wisdom on his part to demand one. It is
not probable, however, that there will be any hesi
tation in making an investigation. It is the duty of
the board to search cut the truth and make it
known, so that if the Warden be guilty he may be
punished, or, if innocent, be cleared of the asper-
According to one of these reports a prisoner was
kept in. a straitjacket for eleven hours, released in a
state of physical collapse and thrown into a cell,
where he lay all night without medical attendance.
He died on the following morning. Another form
of inhumanity is cited in a report that a prisoner suf
fering from a broken leg was left to lie in his cell
four weeks without medical attendance, so that the
leg knit by itself, leaving the sufferer a helpless
cripple, and when at last an effort was made to re
pair the injury the victim died while undergoing the
operation.
In defense of the Warden against charges of that
form of ill-treatment of men under his control,
either as prisoners or as attaches of the prison, it
may be pleaded that he was acting in the interests of
the State in trying to be economical, but no such
defense can be made against other charges even
more serious. It is stated that he has made use of
the straitjacket as a means of punishment with such
harshness that several prisoners have broken, down
under it, and in one instance the punishment is al
leged to have been the cause of death.
It has been charged that Wilkinson has been
harsh in his treatment of attaches and prisoners.
Among other specifications of harshness it ' is said
that in his desire to nuke a showing of economy in
his administration he has compelled the prison
guards lo sleep on unclean sheets, " which are
changed but once a month, has cut down their al-Â»
lowance of soap and committed other acts of petty
tyranny in the name of economy. Much more se
rious are the reports of his treatment of prisoners,
who are said to have been forced to go through the
winter scantily clad and insufficiently fed.
One of the charges against him, that of having
tampered with the United States mails and having
removed letters from a mail bag, will of course be
dealt with by the Federal authorities, but there are
plenty of others to occupy the attention of the State
officials.
UPON the charges made against Warden Wil
kinson 7)f the State penitentiary at Folsom
The Call has no judgment to pronounce- at
this time further than to say they are sufficiently se
rious and sufficiently authenticated to make an in
vestigation imperatively necessary. That investiga
tion should be at once undertaken by the Board of
Prison Directors and be carried out in the most thor
ough and comprehensive manner.

Sevfnty-two bolts of jusi cloth have
hven seized by the customs officials in the
Poetoflice addressed to Winkelbach and
coming from Schnerderwind. The latter
is in danger of losing his position.
Chief Clerk Cress Unger said that after
Conway had learned unofficially that the
tariff had bo.en imposed It was Conway's
duty to Inquire of the Collector or his
representatives as to his duty in the mat
ter.
What are alleged to be careless and un
businesslike methods in the San Francisco
Pottoffice are being investigated by Spe
cial Treasury Agents West and Channing.
Owing to the San Francisco Postpfflce
having neglected to take official notice of
the going into effect on March 8 of this
year of the treaty imposing a tariff of 75
per cent of the rates in the Dlngley bill
on all products of. the Philippines, many
hundreds of packages of du' liable go ods
*rom Manila have been allowed to be
landed here without being inspected and
without the duties having been paid upon
1 The discovery was made by Custom
house authorities through complaints that
a man named J. Winkelbach had been
selling embroideries and Jusi cloth to
fashionable dressmakers in this city at
prices which indicated that the duty had
not been paid on them. A watch was set
on Winkelbach by the customs officials
and they found that he had been smug
gling the goods in through the Postonlce
in this city as mail matter in packages
net exceeding four pounds in weight each.
These packages were delivered to Wink
elbach without being inspected in any
way and without being assessed for duties.
I Further Jnevstigatlon disclosed the fact
I that the smuggled goods were deposited
i in the postoffice in Manila by Richard
: Schnerderwind, a postoffice clerk in that
I place. The packages on arriving in this
city passed through the hands off George
F. "Conway, who is not only a postofflce
clerk, but a sworn customs official as
well, his duties as such customs official
being to inspect every, package of mail
â¢ matter liable to the payment of duties
and report the same to the Collector.
This duty Conway neglected to perform,
although he was aware that Congress had
imposed duties on all articles coming
from the Philippines. It is estimated that
because of this neglect tho Government
has been defrauded of a considerable sum
of money since March 8 of this year.
In the absence of Postmaster Montague
yesterday afternoon D. S. Richardson,
general superintendent of the Postofflce,
was asked concerning the matter. He re
plied that his department, so far as he
was aware, had no knowledge of the af
fair. Mr. Conway, on being interviewed,
shitted the blame upon the Custom-house.
He said that ever since the Philippines
liad been declared American territory and
not subject to the prevailing tariff he
had been handling mail matter from that
archipelago as domestic mail, and that
vhen the act of March 8 was passed he
was not officially advised of its passage.
He had telephoned an inquiry to another
dÂ«rk in the Postofflce regarding the effect
of the treaty, but the person addressed
replied that he had heard nothing offl
i cially either.
In the afternoon the recently elected
offlcers were installed by Supreme Junior
Mrs. Lydia A. Monroe of Riverside, as
sisted by Supreme Representatives Mrs.
M. H. Weldon and Mrs. Mary A. Fitz
gerald. The grand body adjourned to
meet next year in . Santa Cruz.

The greater portion of the closing ses
sion of the Grand Temple of the Rath
bone Sisters was taken up yesterday by
the representatives asking questions of
law of the order and questions relative to
the ritualistic work. The former were
answered by the committee on laws and
tho latter by the grand chief and other
grand officers.
The matter of the Pythian Home was
referred back to the lodges for their
views on the subject. . : V
Grand Chancellor Calkins called atten
tion to the matter of arranging for an
exhibit from each county during the con
vention in August. Following his ad
dess, which wa'a full of wise suggestions,
the grand body resolved itself into a com
mittee of the whole and discussed the
matter at great length. After the appoint
ment of W. H. Grant as chairman of a
committee of one from each county and
Herman Schaffner as secretary it was
decided to select one. member or non
member from each county to present the
matter in the most forcible manner be
fore the Supervisors of each county that

Mains explained that he was employed
at a salary of $3000 per annum, payable
monthly, and that not needing any of
his salary before his arrest he had not
drawn any, and after his arrest he could
not establish communication with his em
ployers. Hence he was without this im
portant piece of evidence also. He said
also that since his arrest various projects
involving millions of dollars and tho syn
dicates he represented had fallen through
because of his incarceration, and the four
billion dollar trust had lapsed Into a
condition of innocuous desuetude.
Mr. Banning made the opening argu
ment for the Government and the case
will be given to the jury to-day.
Mrs. Mains, wife of the defendant, and
her two little boys testified that Mrs. Gif
ford, mother of Walter Scott Glfford, the
actuary of the mythical syndicates, had
burned all the letters that had been re
ceived by Mains from Rothchild. Gifford
and Davis, the leading members of the
four billion dollar money trust. Mrs.
W. W. Parks, who resides next door to
the Mains, testified that a large quantity
of papers were burned by the Mains chil
dren when their mother and Mrs. Gifford
were absent from home. Mrs. Parks said
also that the Mains furniture and piano
were marked "W. Dav!s, Battle Creek
Michigan/' Â¦
BURNED ALL THE LETTERS.
F. G. Bond, a railroad conductor, who
had been called as a witness by Mains,
testified that the packing case containing
Mains' furniture and piano were marked
"W. Davis" when they were taken from
the train to 3132 Twenty-fifth street. This
was to back up the contention of the
prosecution that W. Davis, millionaire,
and ilalns were one and the same person.
On the preceding day Mains swore that
the little pamphlet produced Mn evidence
entitled "The Road to Wealth," being a
prospectus of the organizations compos-
Ing the syndicates, had been printed In
the East, that the proof sheets had been
sent to him from New York by Marcus
Rothchild, another millionaire without an
address or an acquaintance in the finan
cial world, and that he, Mains, had had
nothing whatever to do with the printing
of the pamphlet. Yesterday Alexander
Dulfer, a printer, testified that he had
printed three hundred copies of the
pamphlet in this city a few months ago
on Mains' order, the defendant furnishing
him with the copy.
PAMPHLETS PRINTED HERE.
On Wednesday Mains testified that he
went Into the vault of the California Safe
Deposit &. Trust Company on the corner
of California and Montgomery streets
with W. Davis, a millionaire Interested
Ih the four billion dollar syndicate, and
had seen Davis check the $25,000,000 of
Becurities in Davis' box. Yesterday the
prosecution called to the witness stand
John D. Robertson, bookkeeper of that
institution who swore that neither
Mains nor his millionaire friend ever had
a box in that institution.- The only Davis
having a safe deposit box there, he said,
was W. Davis, a saddler on Front street
and an old patron. .
Mains passed an uncomfortable day In
court yesterday. He is on trial before
a jury in the United Stales District Court
for using the United State l'ostoffice in
an attempt to bunko Dr. Charles E. Ben
nett of Wausjeon, Ohio, out of $3000 by
the promise, that Dr. Bennett would
be made president of a four billion dol
lar syndicate that had $25,00&,000 on de
posit in banks in this city, and $1,300,000
subject to Mains' order.

HEBPICIDE NOT A FAKE.
Unsolicited Testimonials Tell of Its ''
Superiority.
Alf R. Kelley. residing at 2195 Devisa-
dero street, San Francisco, Cal., writes
the following:
"When I first purchased Herpicide I
thought, like the majority of hair prepa-
rations, it would prove a fake. I am
happy to state that, on the contrary, it is
all, and even more than you claim for it.
Quite a number of barbers throughout the
section in which I travel have called at-
tention to the new hair sprouting out on
my scalp, and inquired of me what I have
been using. I tell them 'Herpicide'; also
give them your name and address."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, May 22.â To-day's stock mar
ket was extremely irregular throughout and
closed with that tendency rather emphasized.
The same stocks changed their course In some
cases and the prevailing disposition of the
speculation was hardly distinguishable and
was, in fact, much confused and mixed.
The anxiety over the coal strike was rather
deeper, on account of the implied threat of the
engineers, firemen and pump-runners in the
anthracite mines to come out unless an eight
hour day is granted them. This would bring
the struggle to an acute stage, as the safety
of the mines is dependent upon their work be
ing done. Some of the steel stocks were heavy
in tone ae a result of the effect of the coal
strike, which is beginning to be felt in that
industry. This did not prevent a Jump of ten
points in Lacka wanna and a late spurt in Del
aware and Hudson. The culmination of 'the
recent extended rise in Canadian Pacific and its
sharp reaction naturally had some sympathetic
influence upon the rest of the market. There
was no news to account for the setback any
more than there has been to account for the
rise, and the movement seemed to be due pure
ly to speculative proflt-taking. The late break
in the stock to below 133 helped to unsettle
the close. A break of six points In Ann
Arbor preferred probably was the re
eult of the settlement of control of that prop
erty. The United States Rubber stocks suf
fered from the poor financial showing of the
company for the past year. St Paul offered
a strong leadership for the grain carriers but
it was not followed with activity, and Union
Pacific was rather persistently heavy offsetting
the effect of St. Paurs advance of 2%. The
news from the crop region was considered en
couraging. Another center of strength was
Amalgamated Copper. The gains in National
Lead were allied to this, being the outgrowth
of the advancing tendency of raw copper The
meeting of support for silver is a benefit to the
Smelter stocks. The money market ' continued
quite easy, with call loans ruling at 4 per cent
or lower and with the sterling exchange mar*
ket fchowing no disposition to advance aeain
The^ market closed active and extremely ir-
Boads were fair and firm in tone. Total
sales, par value, $2,525,000. *"""

CHICAGO, May 22.â Weather of the same fa
vorable character for all crops as has pre
vailed almost uninterruptedly since the open-
Ing of spring dominated the wheat market at
tho opening. Cables were lower, the early ex
port demand was slow and conditions began
to favor seeding In the Northwest. Receipts
were still light, but there was argument to the
effect that last year's big movement was a re
sult of sweeping bins clean all over the coun
try in anticipation of last year's big crop and
that this year's receipts would naturally total
much less. Further, the staall crop bull argu
ment has been a losing one for nine days â that
is, ever since July touched 76 %c For this
reason longs had plenty of stuff for sale. As
a result July started out weak and at once grew
weaker, opening %@%c lower at 74%@74c and

Malinda Strawberries came to hand in better
condition and prices were a shade higher for
the best offerings. There were no crates re
ceived. Longworths were in fair condition and
prides were unchanged. A few drawers of
Raspberries came in and sold promptly at the
quotations. Choice Gooseberries met with- a,
fair demarid, but there is a lot of small stuff
coming In. which sells slowly.
A few more drawers of Currants were re
ceived and sold at $1 50 per drawer.
Cherries were easier as receipts were large
and there | was no shipping demand. The
greater part of the receipts in bulk boxes were
poor and sold at low prices.
Desirable sizes of fancy Oranges were in de
mand and scarce, the bulk of the offerings be
ing second class stock, which moved slowly
There is very little Grape Fruit coming in and
the demand and supply about balance. Lem
ons are cleaning up well and the receipts are
very light. The market is almost bare of ripe
Bananas and there will be none received for

* ?; ft A B 2 yne ls the defendant in a suit
for $400 brought by Edward Ackley, as
signee of a claim against the widow for
medical services rendered by Dr P A
Kearney. Denis Kearney ls a witness for
the plaintiff, and objected strenuously
when Attorney Nagle sought to Introduce
in evidence the fact that Mrs. .Boyne ls
suing him to set aside alleged forged
promissory notes. He glowered at Nagle
and said:
"I'll meet you outside, and I'llâ"
"You can meet me any old place " re
torted Nagle.
Mrs. Boyne chipped in at this juncture
and cast aspersions on Kearny's brav
ery, and for a minute or two pandemon
ium reigned.
"I have a son, your Honor, who is a
fighter. He went to Manila, and never
left the firing line. Denis Kearney never
f^ ught u any Â»!?Â« but in the sand lots, and
there he used his mouth."
So said Mrs. Elizabeth Boyne in Judge
Graham's Court yesterday after Denis
Kearney had threatened to annihilate At
torney James F. Nagle. The court in
formed Mrs. Boyne that any further re-
m *. rks ,./ r Â£ nl her would be superfluous

WELL-KNOWN JOURNALIST
LIES AT DEATH'S DOOR
NAP A, May 22.â The Rev. D. O. Crow
ley, head of th.e Youths' Directory' in San
Francisco, who recently purchased the
Rutherford ranch in the valley for a
school of agriculture, was here Wednes
day, the guest of Father Slattery.
Father Crowley spends most of his
time on the ranch, directing the work of
getting the property in shape. for the re
ception of his wards. He has a number
of the older boys with him, and when the
harvest begins more will be taken up
from the Directory in San Francisco. He
is most enthusiastic over the success of
the project thus far, and is untiring in
his efforts to hurry the work along. His
idea is to teach the boys not only the
scientific but the practical side of farm
ing as well. He wants them to know not
only what kinds of soils are best adapted
to the growth of various crops, but also
how to plant, cultivate, harvest and mar
ket the crops.

"Make known, if the situation seems to
you to necessitate partial or total evacua

them. In conclusion Le Journal's : cor
respondent says there are vague rumors
at Fort de France of further, disasters.
According to the latest advices received
here quiet is restored at Fort de Franca
and there has been no general exodus
of the people, though 1000 persons have
gone to the island of Guadeloupe and the
island of St. Lucia and 3000 more have re
moved to the towns and> villages in the

TACOMA. May "22.â News of another
tragedy on the bleak overland route from
Nome to Ilamnia was received to-day by
the steamer Humboldt, from Juneau. A
brief outline of the story was obtained
there by Purser Ballantlne of the Hum
boldt from officers of the steamship Ex
celsior, which had just reached Junwiu
from Ilamnia and Valdes. The Excel
sior is due on the Sound to-night, and is
believed to have on board the surviving
members of the party.
Four men traveling from Nome to
Ilamnia were caught late in March in a
terrific blizzard and lost their way. It
was several days before they got back
on the right trail. In the meantime they
had run out of provisions and were un
able to replenisll their stock from any
source. One of the men finally broke
down and was unable to go further. His
companions killed one of their dogs, but
this one member could not eat dog meat
and died of starvation. His companions
killed the rest of their faithful animals
and ate them one by one.. This prolonged
their lives until they had nearly reached
Ilamnia Lake, where they met another
party and were given food. Pureer Eal
lantine was unable to secure the names
of the members of the party.

LOS ANGELES. May 22.â Judge Smith
to-day reversed the verdict of the Police
Court in the case of J. : E. and Maud
Chesebro, convicted by Judge Austin of
the crime "of practicing the business and
art of mediunrahip, clairvoyance and life
reading, receiving fees for the exercise
and exhibition of their art without having
first obtained a license from said city
so to do." ' They had been fined $30.
"There is 'no question,," said his Honor,
"that the city has v the right to license
all trades, businesses and professions
practiced within its precincts. This is a
general right guaranteed the municipal
ity by the law of the land, but there is
one exception to the callings that shall
be licensed. This exception is found in
the constitution of the State of California
which declares that any and all religions
may be practiced without hindrance or
discrimination. Of course this provision
is not to.be construed so as to interfere
in any manner with the policy of the
State, Until . more light Is thrown upon
the subject neither the court nor the jury
has a right to declare that spiritualism is
not a religious belief. In the event it
is shown to be such no license can be
imposed upon its advocates or devotees."
The judgment of the lower court is re
versed and a new trial ordered.
Not a Eeligion Is the
'.. Question.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
A dispatch to the Daily Telegraph from
Pretoria says that the Boers are seeking
permission to retain their horses.
Cabling from Pretoria under date of
Wednesday, May 21, the correspondent of
the Times says the Boer meeting there is
necessarily final and.it is believed that
the Boer delegates after obtaining- infor
mation on certain points will return to
Vereenlging.
Tlie Daily Mall this morning says that,
owing to the protracted haggling of the
Boer leaders at Pretoria. Great Britain
has presented to them what is practically
an ultimatum, their reply to which is
awaited and which it is expected they will
accept. __
Dispatches received here from Pretoria,
continues the Daily Mail, say that dur
ing the stay of the Boer delegates there
the conference will continue at Vereentg
lng and that a majority of those present
at the conference are trying to persuade
the recalcitrant minority into a unani
mous vote. In the meantime the British
columns have been resting and refitting
and are now all ready for Immediate ac
tion. The Daily Mail says it believes the
delegates at Pretoria will dispatch the
ultimatum to the conference at Vereenig
ing for its consideration.

camp of horse buyers has finished its
work here. The vaqueros were discharg

and about 2500 horses have been bought.
The fact that the Cabinet was sum
moned so quickly after the arrival of tha
delegate at Pretoria Is regarded as a
good augury, as the discussions at Pre
toria could only have commenced Mon
day. The Cabinet will meet late this
afternoon in order to enable the Min
isters who are at a distance to reach Lon

vet no sign of concession on the part oi
the mills. The mill-owners are ready, to
shut up their mills for the remainder of
the year. The lockout threatens to spread
to the State, and the strength of the State
Federation of Labor will be thrown into
A temporary injunction to prevent in
terference with business was issued late
this afternoon by Judge Sears in. the Cir
cuit Court against the various labor
unions and organizations involved in the
strike. The plaintiffs were the six plan
ing mills, among whose employes the
strike began. Harry Gurr, president of the
Federated Trades, to-day made the fol
lowing statement: â¢ â¢
"Life or death for organized labor is in
volved in this strike and organized labor
is expected to stand solidly, unitedly tor
its principles. A great principle is at
stake We have every assurance from the
unions that they will stick by what they
are doing. At the meeting of the Feder
ated Trades to-morrow night a report 'on
the progress of the strike will be made
and "further action outlined.
"If further strikes are determined upon
they will probably go into effect Satur
day. The strike will be extended over the
State. If it Is necessary the trainmen and
6teamboat men will be called out, and no
lumbering material' will be transported
Every union throughout the State will
stand by the action taken. We are ready
and willing at any time to meet the mill
owners and settle the matter. The test
of union strength comes at a critical time,
perhaps, but it is necessary."

GRADTJATIOH" EXERCISES
AT THE ACADEMY BOOTH
School Children Render Their Com-
mencement Programme Before
Large Crowd at Irish Fair.
The closing exercises of St. Peter's
Academy were held last night at the Irish
Fair under the auspices of the Academy
booth, which is one of the most popular
at the great festival. Miss Agnes Fitzger
ald was the only graduate, but a very in
teresting and entertaining programme oÂ£
vocal and instrumental music and reci
tations was rendered by the pupils of the
school. The Academy booth is the only
one that does not represent a county of
Ireland. Its object is to raise money to
secure better accommodations for the sis
ters of St. Peter's School. The ladies who
have charge of this booth have worked
very diligently for its success. The booth
is situated in the gallery and is very beau,
tifully decorated. Visitors to the fair
should not fail to pay it a visit.
Although the crowd at the fair did not
near approach in number the vast throng
that attended on the previous evening,
the Pavilion was well filled. After the
completion of Academy booth's pro
gramme the visitors spent their time in
inspecting the other booths and viewing
the performance in the Irish dance hall or
beautiful pictures in the art gallery or in
listening to the musical selections ren
dered bv the Iroquois Band.
Charles B. Tidball, the superintendent,
entertained his theatrical, friends yester
day. His smile was broader than ever.
The Young Men's Institute and the
Young Ladies' Institute will hold the
boards at the Pavilion to-night. This
will be the last night that free passes
will be honored at the fair. To-morrow
night every one wishing to attend the fair
will have to pay the small price of 10 or
Â£5 cents.
This will also be Sligo night. This
county will hold its evening at home.
Mrs. J. O'Connor is president and the as
sistants are Mrs. Conaty. Mrs. May,

EAELY MORNTNG FIRE
DOES $500O DAMAGE
union Square Building Ignited i by
the Combustion of Photo
graphic Supplies.
Fire broke out at 1:30 o'clock this mV>rn
ing in the Union Square building. 143
Stocktcn street, and before it was sub
dued damage to the amount of $5000 was
done. The principal sufferers are the
Louis H. Bien Company, dealers in op
tical goods and photographic supplies, and
Brcck & Rosenberg, tailors, who occupied
the ground floor of the building.
Upstairs were doctors' offices for the
nicst part, and these suffered some dam
age from smoke and water.
It is thought that the fire started from
spontaneous combustion among the
photographic chemicals in the building.
The flames had gained considerable
headway before the arrival of the fire de
partment, but yielded readily to the nu
merous streams of water turned on.

Last night another meeting of the ex
ecutive " committee â¢ was held for the pur
pose of discussing the criticisms that
have been made concerning its action of a
week ago. . Resolutions were . finally
drawn, commencing, "Whereas, . in view
of certain misstatements made by W. N.
Harris and the press of the San Joaquin
Valley," and further explaining that false
Impressions have arisen as to Fresno's
attitude toward the valley association
and its Los Angeles work. The resolution
shows that Harris' explanations . were not
considered as entirely satisfactory and
just what his future relations with tho
executive committee .will be is a matter
of speculation. Â¦
Harris was as much surprised as the
committeemen. He stated that the letter
had been written as a private . one to
Brown and he had never expected it. Jo be
published. He had anticipated no trouble
from it and had merely intended itTas a
piece of diplomacy to conciliate the Stock
ton people in case any future opportunity
for co-operation should arise.
In a Stockton paper of last Saturday
appeared a letter written by .Harris to
Brown, stating that the action -of the
Fresno chamber had been' contrary to his
advice and that in spite of his efforts to
keep her in line, this county: had "slopped
over.". He said he had grown tired of
trying to keep Fresno lined up, but would*
make one more attempt to get the local
chamber to reconsider its action. The let
ter* was a great surprise "to the other
members of the executive committee, who
yesterday held a meeting and demanded
an explanation from Harris.
, On May 14 the executive committee here
decided to sever connection with the Los
Angeles bureau on July 1, the time at
which the original agreement expired. A
whirlwind- of criticism frouaail-partsiof
the valley followed and the Fresno Cham
ber of Commerce and Fresno County in
general have been -accused of all sorts "of
things, by every paper from Stockton to
Bakersfield. . â¢ -. r v: <
The matter grew out of Fresno's with
drawal a week ago from the work of the
San Joaquin Valley Commercial Associa
tion in Â¦ Los Angeles. When the local
chamber first agreed to assist in the work
it was with the understanding that it
should be continued for six months. The
chamber's executive committee has long
been satisfied that the Los Angeles
scheme is not accomplishing as much
good for Fresno as. could be accomplished
with the same amount of money expended
along other lines. 'Harris has been one of
the most ardent advocates of Fresno's
dropping the valley association's Los An
geles work, which he said was en
tered Into merely because of "sentiment"
felt by Fresno toward the other counties.
FRESNO, May 22.â W. N. Harris, who
has been prominently identified wltK the
work of the Fresno Chamber of Com
merce for some time, is at present in hot
water with the executive committee of
that body over a letter written by him. to
Secretary Brown of the Stockton Chani-!
ber of Commerce.

In appointing White the court held that
as representatives of; the -society for the
protection of children formerly looked out
for the Aliens, White-was their logical
guardian and was better fitted than Mrs.
Biter to care for them.' " .Â¦**Â¦- v y Â¦ â¢ .â,,
j Secretary White is the fifth of the
guardians the children have had in the
last five years. They were first under the
care of Charles P. Welsh, who surren
dered them to W. P. Parnell. Parnell
turned them over to Mrs. Lydia Prescott.
v/ho placed them in the custody of Mrs.
Biter, who cared for them on her farm in
Marln County until White raided the
place and tried to take them from^her.
In his complaint against Mrs. Biter
White alleged that the farm was dirty
and poorly kept, and that Mrs. Biter was
not a fit person to have the custody of the
children. He also claimed that, as the
Biters were vegetarians and gave their
charges only cereals and vegetables to
eat, the little ones were not properly
nourished. \ â¢ ,
Secretary M. J. "White of the . Califor
nia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children was appointed guardian of
Phoebe, Echo and Nellie Allen in Depart
ment 9 of the Superior Court yesterday.
The appointment is the culmination of a
three years' struggle for the custody of
the children waged by White and Mrs.
Catherine J. Biter of Marin County.
The delegates to the national convention
of Horseshoers' Unions enjoyed a trip on

The members of the District Council of
the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Join
ers met last night and discussed the de
cision of Judge Seawell. McCarthy's vic
tory was not regarded as a decisive blow
to the brotherhood men in the fight they
arc- waging. Encouraging reports from
outside unions were received.
My conclusion is that the defendants had a
legal right to organize for the purposes stated
in tile constitution of the Building Trades Coun
cil and that plaintiff is not entitled to an in
junction.
I do not find that defendants threaten to In
terfere with the members of Local 483, other
wise than by refasing to work with them upon
any building bo long as they do not possess the
v.orking card of the council. It is contendea
on the part of the plaintiff that the council
constitutes an unlawful combination and con
spiracy in' restraint of" trade and _ commerce
within the meaning of the act of Congress en
titled "An act to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraints an<J monopolies."
Th'e court considered the evidence, and
in his summary says:
Judge Seawell decided yesterday that
P. IT. McCarthy and the Building Trades
Council, of which he is president, are not
prejudiced against W. A. Cole and the
United Brotherhood . of Carpenters and
Joiners No. 483, and refused to issue an
Injunction restraining McCarthy and the
council from boycotting the plaintiff.
Judge Seawell holds that the defendants
have not combined against -Cole and his
fellow plaintiffs to prevent them from
working at their trade and have not en
tered into a conspiracy for the purpose of
doing the plaintiffs any injury.
Cole's organization, now known as
Union No. -483 of the United Brotherhood
of Carpenters and Joiners, is not affiliated
with the Building Trades Council, having
withdrawn from that body in July, 1901,
subsequently becoming a member of the
United Brotherhood. The members of the
council refused to work with them there*,
after, thereby, alleged Cole, making it al
most impossible for the. members of his
organization to earn a living.
Judge Seawell says:

MISS GOHEN'S STATEMENT.
THE investigation into the facts
in connection with the shooting
of Ernest Brown, : a grocer's
clerk, In a room at 603 McAllister
street at an early hour yesterday
morning developed that Brown met his
death by his own' hand while laboring
under excitement prompted by family
troubles and probable jealousy.
The principals in the affair discussed
the tragedy without reserve yesterday,
particularly as it was suspected .. that
murder might have been done. Henry
Hencken, the grocer for whom. Brown
worked, was ' almost, prostrated "with
grief over the occurrence, ' while Miss
Lucy Gohen, a waitress. at 503 Van, Ness
avenue, with whom Brown appears to
have been Infatuated, and who left him
a moment before he fired the fatal shot,
is almost ill from worry and* excitement
attending the grewsome affair. - .;
Brown's parents live at Healdsburg,
whence he came some three months
since. He secured employment with H.
& M. Hencken, grocers at the corner . of
McAllister and Franklin streets. Brown
appeared to be a good fellow, i honest
and trustworthy, and soon suc
ceeded in gaining the respect of his em
ployers. He roomed above the store, oc
cupying a chamber adjoining - that , of
Hencken. The two became: unusually
friendly, and Hencken enjoyed .Brown's
confidence to an unusual degree. They
went to places of amusement together,
and, as it turned out, visited the same
girl In company. The girl In; the case is
Miss Gohen, the waitress, an attractive
maiden of nearly 18 years. She was.era
" ployed at the hotel where - Brown .and
Hencken dined daily. In this way rthey,
met frequently In the last six weeks, and
for Brown, at least, the friendship .was
to become a serious matter. Â¦ . â¢ . Â¦
'.That Brown committed suicide/ is evi
denced by the conditions present when
his body was found. He had partly dis
robed, and while" lying on the bed he de
liberately raised his undergarment and
placing his left [{ hand over the heart
thrust- the â¢Â¦ muzzle of the revolver be
tween the fingers against his breast and
fired. > The fingers as well as the wound
.were bddly powder- burned. That Brown
went into his^room while Hencken was
asleep Is evidenced , by the fact that the
key to his trunk, which he always c-ar
Â¦ ried, was found Â¦ in> the lock and the lid
slightly- raised.' Among; his effects were
discovered letters "from his mother;'an
nouncing that -she was greatly troubled
byher husband's conduct.' Another let
ter from- a^ friend announced that his
rno,ther two weeks ago had: been thrown
from a- buggy and" her' collarbone broken.
On receipt of .'this letter -Brown became
Â¦noticeably, despondent.- .;Â¦ An hour before
the tragedy he 'was .accosted by a friend,
who wanted, to know what was troubling
him.' Brown said he would be all right
in â¢ the. -morning, rbut ! his . moodiness did
not, disappear. â¢ - '*Â¦ -Â¦ Â¦ , â¢.
-.tvTHe 1 . investigation of < the facts of. the
j by. Detective '. Sergeants Armstrong
.and 1 Whl taker resulted in their fillnc a
"report > with Captain ! Seymour that Brown
had committed .: suicide. The body now
lies at the Morgue, -where it will be held
pending Instructions from Brown's par
ents at ' Healdsburg. ' Arrangements for
iholdlng the inquest are now In progress.
STORY OF HKCTCKEW.
Hencken . corroborates Miss | Gohen's
story in every- detail;. He said he saw
Brown in the' store after leaving Miss
Gohen and requested him to take the girl
home. He- agreed to do so and went up
stairs." After figuring up the cash regis
ter- he went ? upstairs and- heard Brown
conversing - with the : girl in his
(Hencken's) - room. Â¦ Hencken ..entered
Brown's room and retired. The first he
knew of the tragedy was when he was
awakened by 1 Officer Smith. He recog
nized the Weapon Â¦ with which the deed
was done as Brown's. Â¦ Hencken declares
he never, owned a- pistol in his life.
Miss Gohen stated further that her ac
quaintance with Brown was casual, and
that he had never given her cause to be
lieve that he was a suitor for her hand.
That he liked her she was aware, but
their friendship 'was so recent tha^ she
had scarcely time in which to study his
characteristics.' , She " could ascribe no
cause for- the- suicide, of Brown, except,
perhaps,- that he was troubled over fam
ily,matters. :: .
He went out and rfiturned In a minute with
the : statement that Hencken,was waitin* for
me at the door downstairs. I left the room
and was going .down the stairs when I heard
a ' shot j flred in Brown's room. I became
frightened- and ran home. \ On " reaching: my
room I fainted ami it was an hour before I
revived. - I then told my â¢ employer of the oc
currence and we reported the matter to Police
man Smith. That's all I know of the event.
Warden Wilkinson has a nephew who
is desirous of becoming a doctor. Wil
kinson discharged Clerk Brainard and
appointed his nephew In his place. Wil
kinson knew that his nephew was buÂ«. 17
vears of age and ineligible to hold the
position, but the law did not daunt him.
Prior to young Wilkinson leaving for the
medical college Warden Wilkinson, it le
charged, ordered all the bodies of the
dead convicts assigned to his nephew,
who dissected them.
It is a State law that when a man is
hanged he is provided with a suit of
clothes, shoes and other articles. Sev
eral days after Putnam was hanged his
brother came from Texas to take charge
of the remains. Putnam's body was- ex
humed from the prison graveyard, but
there was not one particle of clothing
upon it. it is declared.
The clothing in which Putnam was
hanged had been removed from his body
and transferred to the storeroom of the
prison, it is alleged. This same clothing,
removed from Putnam's dead body, was
assigned to a convict who had served his
sentence, and the State was charged dou
ble for one suit of clothes. It is said.
Since the expose of the alleged mis
management of the Folsom prison under
Warden Wilkinson's administration new
charges are being made. When George
Putnam, sentenced to death for the kill
ing of Convict Showers, was confined in
a condemned cell he was laced, so it is
charged, in a straitjacket ten days be
fore he was hanged for tearing some of
his blankets. ;
Lyonsville is the: camp a where a large
mill of the Sierra Lumber " Company is
situated. .About a dozen men employed by
the company lingered late In William
Lucas 1 saloon. Four, of them were play
ing poker and the others were watching
the game.- Suddenly,' without warning,
a large gasoline lamp suspended over the
table exploded with a loud report and
scattered the burning gasoline over tlie
crowd and through the room. There was
a scramble for the door, which, before
the explosion, had stood open, but. had
been blown closed by- the concussion. At
the same time I the night latch shot in
place and prevented escape. The clothing
of nearly all. the men was ignited. Those
who first freed themselves of their flaming
garments assisted the others.
As the flames sprang up the wall the
men struggled desperately at the door,
which was finally beaten down from the
outside. As the men -rushed outthe.bar
crumbled to the floor. - John Sprague was
most severely burned.". His case is very
serious. George Hudson, who crawled
under the bar, was struck in the eye and
was badly burned. Bob Greer. the only
one who escaped injury, .was nearer the
lamp than any of the others. .He was
standing on a chair -and directly under
the lamp, his head not more than a foot
away from it. .Strange to say he . was
not burned at all.
' REDDING,: May 22.â John Sprague is
suffering ' from burns which - may prove
fatal, Georg^e . Hudson will lose an eye
and nine or ten other men. at Lyonsville,
in the foothills, near the county .line, are
suffering with burns of varying se'verity
as the result of a most peculiar accident.
A' gasoline lamp exploded in a crowded
barroom, throwing the oil over
every man in the room but one.'

MORE CHARGES
AGAINST WARDEN
When the case of . Rev. James H.
Kelley of the Third Colored Baptist
Church, charged with betrayal under
promise of marriage by Miss Hattle
Bynum, was called in Judge- Cabanlss'
court yesterday, Attorney Cobb, for the
defendant, said he had two or three more
witnesses, but as they were not present
he would rest. As he was suffering from
a severe cold he asked for a continuance,
as he desired to argue the case. The
Judge hinted that it would be useless,
but granted Cobb's request and set the
argument for next "Wednesday morning.
Pastor Kelley's Case Submitted.
Â¦ The neighbors testify to the affection
that existed between the couple. Leas
had always been spoken of as a devoted
husband. \
They subsequently rn^de up -their little
difference and Leas went to prepare a
bath. While he was doing so- Mrs. Leas
went into the sitting-room and picking
up a revolver from a table fatally shot
herself, the bullet penetrating the left
breast.
Leas rushed out for assistance but the
woman was beyond all aid.
The Leases took up their residence at
Carville some six weeks ago, her doctor
having ordered Mrs. Leas there on ac
count of her falling health. She was in a
despondent state of mind, owing to a
year's suffering. ...
Last night Leas, who Is a coachman for
Mr. Zinkand, returned home, ' and finding
no supper ready, scolded his wife.
The Inhabitants of Carville at the beach
were startled last night by a tragedy that
happened In- their midst. The usually
peaceful ocean suburb was thrown into
a state of excitement at 8:30 o'clock, when
the news got around that Mrs. Mabel J.
Leas, wife of John S/Leas, had taken her
own life by shooting herself through the
breast.
FLAMING ROOM
THEIR PRISON
Car 634, in charge of Motorman Col
broth and Conductor Wallett had arrived
at. the end of the line and was waiting to
leave on schedule time. The motorman
heard the roar of the oncoming cars and
saw them coming in a cloud of dust. He
warned AVallett and the two jumped from
their car and rushed behind the building
close to the track. The sand cars struck
the standing car with a terrific crash.
The Impetus carried the passenger car up
an embankment 150 feet back and the first
sand car telescoped it. â¢
The two cars were so firmly wedged by
the collision that a dozen workmen labor
ed all afternoon separating them. Both
cars were wrecked by the collision. The
passenger car presented a mutilated ap
pearance. Not a : glass remained intact
and the front part was smashed and
twisted into an inconceivable- shape.
Motorman Colbroth said the sand cars
must have traveled at the rate of a mile
a minute. Had there been a car laden
with passengers In the path of the run
away sand-cars a terrible accident would
surely have happened. Fortunately the
cars broke loose at a time when, the track
was clear. Passengers on ingoing cars
were given a spare by seeing the tears
dash past them at a terrific speed. The
track for more than three miles was cov
ered with sand that fell off the cars dur
ing their swift passage.
Fate dealt kindly with pleasure seekers
who rode out to the ocean j beach on tjie
cars . of : the United Railroads Company,
yesterday morning." Two cars, heavily,
laden',/with -sand, /were being drawn along
the track by an electric 1 traction car. By
some means the cars coupled to the trac
tion car broke away and began to roll
downs th'e long, grade near. Nineteenth
avenue, and within a minute they were
dashing toward the ocean beach at a high
rate' of -speed. ' They - rushed around
curves, and past switches at a terrific
rate and continued to the end of the road.
