Discussion of the Philippine bill in the

In bitterness, took on an amusing phase.
In a breezy epeech Dolliver of Iowa made
euch a good-natured and yet such a sar
castic arraignment of Carmack of Ten

the thronged galleries were convulsed
Â¦with laughter. "While -seemingly consid
erable temper was aroused by the debate.
SENATORS STILL
Senator Patterson requested that the
daughter of Sixto Lopez be summoned.
but the committee took no action.
Sergeant Manning placed the first oc
casion he had seen the water cure admin
istered at Leon, island of Panay. He said
some Filipinos were supposed to- have
knowledge of the murder of Private
O'Hearn and Captain Gregg ordered wit
ness and the men under him to apply the
water cure to. them.
Sergeant Dube said that while doing
duty at Jaro, In the Island of Panay, he
conveyed a native, apparently of wealth
and education, to the house of Lieuten
ant Conger. Eighteenth Infantry, where
the lieutenant. Major Glenn and three
privates of the Eighteenth Infantry ad
ministered the water cure, apparently
without any cause. The witness described
the burning of houses during a march
across Panay and told of the act of their
native guide In cutting off the head of a
Filipino with a bolo before the troops
could get him to surrender.
WITHOUT ANY CAUSE.
January H. Manning of Boston, of the
same regiment, said the water cure was
administered to natives by order of Cap
tain Gregg to secure a confession as to
the death of Private O'Hearne, who was
burned to death. He said there was no
doubt of the guilt of the parties. He also
testified to the kind treatment accorded
to Filipino prisoners.
Isador II. Dube of Watertown. Mass..
formerly sergeant in Company A, Twen
ty-sisth Volunteer Infantry, testified be
fore the Philippine Committee to-day. He
saw the water cure administered to a
native in the presence of Lieutenant Con
cer and Captain Glenn. He also told of
the burning of houses in the Island of Pa
rtay. He cited a case where a woman
â¢was put into a house with fifteen male
prisoners. He said the Filipino prisoners
and the peaceful natives were treated
with great kindness by the Americans.
The verdict of the Smith court-martial
has not yet been received. No one doubts
but it will be acquittal. It is pointed out
that the court would hardly convict Gen
eral Smith lor conducting a campaign that
had received the approval of the Secre
tary of War.
WILL BE ACQUITTED.
In the Senate there has been no dispo
sition so far to justify the "kill and
bum" order of General Smith. On the
contrary. Republican members of that
body have severely criticized it and have
stated that the abuses were not approved
by the administration.
In some quarters the disposition is to
believe that the Secretary of War is so
dissatisfied with the course of events that
he may resign. It is pointed out that he
â¢would hardly care to remain at the head
of the department if Congress should re
fuse to indorse his approval of the Bell-
Smith orders.

I could not do it without stultxfyir-s myself

At that time I was a .candidate for Congress

Campbell informed me that unless I did as he
suggested in the matter that the support of

him I had no interest in Thompson's nght and
that J would not interfere with It.
He informed me that that was not what
they wanted. He said that in order to prevent
Thompson's reappointment Senator Perkins
must be reached, and that I was the only one
through whom, he could be reached, as I was
a hold-over Senator and he was looking for
re-election.
I i told him that Senator Perkins would not
place a very. high estimate on. any promise of

Perkins to rime and give him to understand
that be would not get any votes from Hum

that Bull was very angry against me and said
that whenever he had asked me to - do any
thing he had round me on the other side. Us
then told me that if I failed to accede to Bull's
wishes that Bull would spend no end of money

EUREKA. May 8.â The opponents of
the ring that has so long shaped the po

"carrying the war into Africa" and the
boasted plans of Sterling A. Campbell,
Collector of the Port of Eureka and a
leading spirit' of the ring, to send a Gage
delegation to the State convention, re
gardless of the will of the people, seems
certain to be knocked sky high.
Campbell has been formally charged
with, corruption and offensive partisanship
and Ma removal by the Federal authorities
demanded. Affidavits accompanying the
charges throw light upon the little bos 3'
conduct of affairs in his own little princi
pality.
The complainant is A. B. Buhne,
Councilman. and his allegations arc
straight from the shoulder. The com
plaint was sworn to April 30 and at oneÂ©
forwarded to Washington and with it
were* sent affidavits by State Senator
Thomas H. Selvage, W. T. S. Hadley,
Arthur W. Hill. Stephen Hill and William
N. Speegle, all of whom support by their
allegations the charges made by Buhne.
The affidavit made by Senator Selvage
and published yesterday by Councilman
Buhne in connection with the sewer pips
scandal was one of the documents aent to
Washington with the charges. It had no
connection whatever with the sewer pipe
affair and its use to discredit Buhne's op

advised. In addition to the direct charge
of an attempt on Campbell's part to hold

Paul Ford was called to the stand and
when under cross-examination testified
that there was a sentiment among the
brothers and sisters that Malcolm should
have a share of the estate of his father if
his future life was such that he would
command respect. He explained that he
meant by this that his brother should
give up all athletic sports. After testi
fying that his father had died from ty
phoid fever, he said:
"I do not see why Malcolm should get
any of the estate, as my father had laid
down his life to save Malcolm. He gave
a worthy life to save an unworthy life."
Paul For* denied that he had entered
Into an agreement to share the estate with

share the estate ' provided Malcolm gave
up athletics originated with his mother,
who has since died.'

It was saidi to-night at the apartment
house in which Malcolm lived that he had

editor of the New Centaur, a monthly
devoted to the interests Â¦ of \ the automo
bile, and published by the New Centaur
Publishing Company. It could ; not be
learned whether or not Malcolm had any.
financial interest in the publication. - On
Tuesday the company â¢ failed and â¢ a re
ceiver was appointed. The failure of the
company would explain to an extent Mal
colm Ford's pressing need of funds, and
would tend, to 'corroborate the; presump
tion of Miss Hall, who said ship thought
i the conversation between the two broth
ers just before the shooting was concern
ing money matters, and that Malcolm
-had again asked- for financial aid.
It was decided to-night : at a family
council that the two brothers should be
buried together. The funeral will be held
Saturday - morning- from ' the â residence.
To-night the bodies were laid out together
in adjoining upper rooms of the house.
Malcolm Ford leaves a son about 7 years
old.
Malcolm W. Ford was born in Brook
lyn, February 7, 1867. He was educated
at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. He
took up athletics while at school, and for
a number of years won championships in
this country and Canada, and, in the 100
yard run, /220-yard run and quarter-mile
run, as well as the 120-yard, hurdles, run
ning broad and running high jumps. He
Â¦married a daughter of Robert Graves, a
wall-paper manufacturer, but they were
divorced. .,
Paul Leicester Ford was 37 years old
and a novelist of much note, "Janice
Meredith" and "The Honorable Peter
Stirling" being his most popular novels.-
He was married about a year ago to Miss
Grace Kidder, daughter of Edward H.
Kidder. of Brooklyn. . He was the son of
Gordon Lester Ford of Brooklyn, who
died eleven years- ago and left an estate
of some $2,000,000, divided among his
children, with the exception of Malcolm,
who was disinherited by the will. ,
CAREERS OF THE FORDS.
Malcolm Ford had for some time been
causing uneasiness to the family through
evidences of an unbalanced mind, and de
clared that in his opinion he attacked his
brother during a period of temporary in
sanity. .
"The cause of Malcolm Ford's action,"
said Captain Brown, "can be explained
by inference. For some time past his
financial affairs have been pressing him,
and he had repeatedly asked and received
material, assistance from his brother. It
is presumed that his importuning had
been such, and his demands so excessive,
that his brother had been forced to re
fuse further aid." j

25, truckman. > Financial loss, $15,000.
When Malcolm was called to the stand
in testify in his own behalf he said that
shortly after his father's death his brother
Paul had spoken to him about the will of
his father, and said:. "I- think you are left
out of the will, but -we; will take. care, of
It is said there was enmity between the
two brothers and that it was of . eleven
years' standing; that never since the
death of their father, have they been on
intimate terms, 'mis alleged enmity on
the part of Malcolm is said to have been
brought about by the fact that the father
of the boys disinherited Malcolm and that
this action on the father's part was be
cause he did not wish Malcolm, to devote
himself to an athletic career.
Mr. Ford, the elder, left a will in which
he made no mention whatever of Malcolm,
bat divided his large estate in equal parts
among his six other children. Malcolm
did not contest the will, and it was admit
tsd to probate shortly after his father's
death. He told his friends at the time
however, that an agreement had been en
tered into between him and his brothers
and sisters by which they had promised
to share with him their father's estate.- !
In May, 1894, Malcolm Ford brought suit
against his brothers and sisters in the
Supreme Court in Brooklyn toi compel
them to live up to the alleged' agreement
Thfi alleged agreement was a verbal one,
and as Malcolm, Ford ..was unable to ad
duce proof of it. the court decided against
him. â¢"*/'Â¦ " â¢
AH OLD ENMITY.
Dr. Barch said that the murder was the
result of temporary mental aberration on
the part of Malcolm Ford, due to nervous
exhaustion.
Mr. Kidder refused to make any state
ment as to the shooting except a brief
(memorandum, which was given to the
police. In this it was said that the cause
or the shooting could only be surmised.
Information from other sources makes it
appear that Malcolm Ford called, to get
money from his brother, and, meeting
vrlth a refusal, shot him. . "
Just what disposition of Malcolm
Ford's body was made, after the shoot
ing, could not be ascertained, but it ap
pears from the statement of certain per
sons acquainted with the details of the
tragedy that the body lay where it fell,
on a rug in the library, for some time,
possibly several hours, so great was the
excitement in the house. In fact, the
murder and" suicide were not known- to
the Coroner until about 2:30 p. m., and not
to" the police until 4:25 p. m. Dr. Barch

The bullet which killed Paul Ford just
grazed the top of his heart and passed
through a large artery ascending from it.
The bullet which killed Malcolm Ford
was fired with the same accuracy of aim,
for It made a wound scarcely an inch
lower than the one which killed his
brother. In fact, the wounds were al
most identical.
Meanwhile Malcolm Ford had called
her. As she turned toward him he placed
his revolver, to his heart, fired and fell,
dying instantly. When Miss Hair turned
to look at Paul he was still standing at
his desk, but rapidly losing strength. She
helped him. to a sofa and then ran next
door .for Mr. Ford's physician, Dr.
Emanuel Barch. In less than live min

man, still conscious, was carried up to a
room beside his wife's and placed upon
nis bed. â¢ He spoke to his wife and aEked
the doctor for his opinion, showing that
he expected death and was going to meet
it calmly and bravely. A few moments
later, about twenty minutes after he was
shot, Mr. Ford died.

the permit and what she said about him,

Of 44 caliber is the weapon, and It came

that there is a shadow of truth in this as
sertion which has been going the rounds
of the newspapers -of the country for the
last few years." 4 /
Vest said that he considered It his duty
to make his statement in order, that his
tory may not be falsified; in order that
the men who -were said to havo. refused
this offer at-the hands of President Liu-,
coin! should not be. made to sin in their
graves, adding: "For if they had refused
what was said to been tendered
them by the President - they would have
been accessories to the' murder of every
man who fell from ; that time In defense
of the Confederacy and they would have
risked everything, that Is held dear
among men in defense of the Confeder
ate cause." ' . >
While the deep silence still reigned in
the chamber as he spoke and with every
eye directed toward him, Vest closed as
follows: â¢ Â¦ , i > â¢
"This account ' of that encounter," con
tinued Vest, "Substantially â¢ and Â¦ " almost
word for word, -as I have given it, came
to me from Mr., Stephens and Mr. Hun

VEST DOES HIS DUTY.
Vest said that this E terminated the in
terview and . as the' Confederate commis
sioners retirecTPresident Lincoln, address
ing Stephens, 1 *, who was the last to go out,
said: "Stephens, you are making a great
mistake. Your Government is a failure
and when the t crash comes, as it soon
must come .there will be chaos and dis
asters, which > we cannot now foresee,
which must come to your people." .
" 'Then,' said Mr. Lincoln,' fthe inter

"Mr. Hunter, to whom the inaulry was
addressed, said: 'Mr. , -President, we are
instructed to consider no proposition that
does not involve the Independence of the
Confederate States of America.'/
When President Lincoln and Secretary
Seward met the commissioners of the
Confederacy, Mr. Lincoln, addressing
himself to Mr. Hunter, whom he knew
well, 'said: 'In.thefirst place, gentlemen,

told him himself , <thei words "Confederate

From the lips of Stephens and Hunter
had come to him, he said, the details of
what had taken place. Upon the return
of the commissioners of the Confederacy
he heard their official report as Reagan
heard\it, the latter being a member of the
Cabinet and the speaker (Vest) a member
of the Senate of the Confederacy. Â¦ Â¦'
"I am to-day the only survivor of the
twenty-six gentlemen who were the Con
federate Senators," he said.
Vest then stated that what did happen
at Hampton Roads, beyond question, was
this:
"If true, it would, mean that the Con
federates could have placed on that sheet
of paper the perpetual establishment of
slavery and the right* of secession, the
most extreme demand that had -ever ta
ken shape even in the dream of any Con
federate." ,â¢ ' Â¦.
WHAT LINCOLN- SAID.
A deep silence: had fallen upon the
chamber and every Senator on the floor
listened to him with rapt attention. Wth
great deliberation he continued:
."If true," said he. "it would place the
Government and> officers of the Confed
eracy in the category of criminals, be
cause it offered the Confederacy all that
It ever demanded in the wildest hope of
the most extreme partisans of that cause
if they would only return to the Union."
Vest said the story had been denied
by John H. Reagan of Texas, who was the
last surviving member of the Confederate
Cabinet.' He knew personally, said Vest,
without having been present at that cele
brated interview, that the incident was
without foundation.- Â¦Â¦"Â¦â¢'
Vest began by calling attention to the
statement of Tillman; made yesterday,
that at the conference in Hampton Roads
in 1864 between President Lincoln, William
H. Seward, Secretary of State; Alexander
H. Stephens, Vice President of the Con
federate States; E. M. T. Hunter, former
United States Senator, and . John H.
Campbell, formerly Justice of the United

handing it to Stephens, said. "Alexander,

for the First Time Since Their
Accession.
LONDON, May 8.â Rarely has the opera
season opened more brilliantly or under
more auspicious circumstances. This
year's opening night will always be re
membered by the fact that It was the flr3t
night that the King and Queen had occu*
pied the royal box since their accession.
There was one unfortunate circum
stance in that the roadway authorities
still had Bow street torn up, though tfiey
had plenty of time and notice to get the
work finished before such a great night.
Much confusion of carriages was caused
in the approach to the opera-house. Â¦ So
great indeed was the block that even the
royal carriage with the King and Queen
could not get by, and in conaequence the
curtain had to be kept down fully ten
minutes to allow the King and Queen to
get in before the playing of the national
anthem, when the whole great audience
rose and cheered with more vigor than
â¢was ever before heard in the opera-house.
It was a most impressive sight. The
Queen was looking radiantly beautiful in
a black dress With a small diamond tiarti.
The Princess Victoria and Princess
Charles of Denmark, who accompanied
their father and mother, were very sim
ply dressed in white.

FUROR AT ELECTION.
The scene of the election this morning
was undoubtedly the most sensational in
the history, of the federation. The crowd
that at three biennials have clamored to
have Mrs. Platt-Decker of Colorado as
their leader were simply set wild at the
mention of her name by Mrs. Gallagher
of . Ohio, who : made the -nominating
speech, and the intense excitement was
as an electric current as it passed
through the audience. Had Mrs. \ Decker
yielded one iota from the firm position
she has taken from the beginning that
as a matter, of justice it should go to
Mrs. Denison, who for one year has been
acting president instead of. Mrs. Lowe,
she could easily have stampeded the
house. . As it was she arose in the gallery
where she sat with the Colorado delega
tion, and with an- earnestness and
straightforwardness not to be mistaken
declined the ! honor. ) '
In a hjimorous way Mrs. Lowe refused
to have Mrs. Decker's name taken from
the blackboard, where it had been placed
by the nominating committee, and,. after
witty passes between the two,' Mrs.
Decker came down to the floor and made
almost a fierce demand that her name be
removed. The dramatic side had reached
the danger line, â¢ whereupon 'Mrs. -Lowe
recommended to. the convention that it
be erased. Though this was done many
of her admirers voted for her anyway,
the vote standing 667 for Mrs. Denison
and 258 for Mrs. Decker^ - â¢
-Though the Decker â¢ forces were keenly
disappointed they have with charming
grace gone to the support of Mrs. Deni
8on - -the girl president," as some one
called her, .-for she is a slight, youthful
woman yet in. the thirties. Mrs. Denison
came to the convention worn out," â¢ and
this morning was -. slightly ill, but there
â¢s no doubt In the minds of the leaders
that she will be equa) to the high of
nce, having had . training as president
four years. of the famous Sorosis of New
York, a/ position she was filling at the
time jjf her election to the higher of

FLOOR INV DEMAND.
_ Keyed up. as the convention was to the
highest pitch," everything considered, this
morning caused more or less disorder, a3
many as twenty women claiming the floor
at once. Indeed ' the . confusion was so
great at times, notwithstanding:, Mrs.

Circuit Court at Watertown to-day Mrs.
Fayne Moore of New York was granted
an absolute divorce by Judge Dennett
from William A. E. Moore, whom she
married in New York City in 1897. In ad
dition to securing her freedom the plain
tiff was given the right to resume her
maiden name of Fayne Strahan. She in
stituted her suit on the grounds of ex
treme 1 cruelty, non-support and conviction
of a felony.
The defendant filed a sensational an
swer, alleging that his imprisonment was
the result of a conspiracy, on -the part of
the plaintiff and her friends to divorce
him in -order > that she might :rnarry a
-wealthy English nobleman. He also de
nied that he had been guilty of any of the
charges preferred by the -plaintiff. -
- NEW YORK, May 8.â Fayne Moore's
husband, William E. Moore, is now serv
ing, a nineteen-year sentence in .Sing Sing
forVtternpting to "badger" the late 1 Mar
tin Mahon out of $5000. in Mrs. Moore's
apartments at the Grenoble Hotel in 1898.
Mahon, who was then proprietor of the
New Amsterdam Hotel, left the State and
refused to appear against Mrs. Moore and 1
she was not prosecuted.'
The first couple of months Moore'spent
In Sing Sing his wife seemed greatly de
voted to him. Then she went to London
and appeared in the chorus of "The Mes
senger Boy"- at the Gayety Theater.
When she filed her suit for divorce it was
said she intended to remarry, if success
ful in obtaining her divorce, an English
man of goad family.
Last January Moore's uncle, Captain
J. W. Moore, a steamship owner of Cleve
land, died leaving him about $100,000.
Fayne .Moore is now about 26 years old.
She is the daughter of Judge Strahan of
Portland, Or., and was known before her
marriage to Moore as "Pet" Strahan. In
1896 she went abroad to study music and
when she returned â¢ she brought Moore
with her to Atlanta, Ga., as her husband.
Moore was United 'States Consul at Dur
ban during Cleveland's second adminis
tration, but was removed by McKinley in
1898.. There were no charges against him.
The badger game for which Moore is
now serving sentence was attempted in
the latter part of 1398. Moore and his
wife had been living In the Waldorf-As
toria. They removed to the Grenoble Ho
tel and Mrs. Moore invited Mahon to cail
on her.. She told him she -wanted to bor

playing a . game Â¦ of . seven, up in' -Mrs.
Mccre's â¢ room Moore burst in the door.

organized efforts it seemed to me that the most
Impressive fact of our association was this
gain Â¦ In numerical strength. And to-night
when we reflect upon the humble beginnings
from which" has developed . this organization
numbering its hundreds of thousands of
women we' find it somewhat difficult to realize
the enormous proportions we- have attained.
But, . my friends, I am not- so much con
cerned with telling you to-night how many .we
have gained in numbers in the past' two years
as I am to "tell you what these numbers have
accomplished. For, after all, the salient and
most hopeful feature of our organization lies
not In our numerical strength, â¢ which has en
abled us and will enable us not only: to think
things but do things, and do things- not only
tir Improve and uplift ourselves,/ but to render
important service in the uplifting | and better
ment or humanity. To this end,' although our
size, numbers and material success are indeed
Important factors, yet . we wish to. have our
material success Inspired with a recognition
oÂ£ spiritual values as well. It is time that
we more fully comprehend that . we are no
longer In the preliminary and adolescent stage
of existence. The question which Interests us
Is no longer the Increase of numbers, for j the

and health. It is by means of such experiences
that" we are finding our soul. We cannot form
any' adequate conception of the vast changes
that will be brought about as j women become
more and more self-conscious. I use the term
in its deep sense and mean that as women be
come more and more conscious of their powers
and the possibilities of their souls they will in
evitably demand wider â¢ fields for their activi

CHICAGO, May 8.â The injunction- bill
which United States Attorney Bethea is
preparing to file against the beef trust
has struck a snag somewhere, and may
not reach the Chicago Federal Court be
fore Monday of next week. All prepara
tions had been made to file the bill to
morrow, and- word had been received
from Washington that it had been for
warded to Chicago so it would reach here
early this evening. It Is now intimated,
however, that nothing might be done De
fore next week. /
It was learned to-day from an authori- i
tative source that the Government hopes
to make -an injunction stick against
members of the combine on two mate
rial clauses In it which deal with the
agreement of the -packers to maintain a
standard price, and the rebates from the
railways. It developed, however, that
not one specific case which the Govern
ment can prove against the packers lead,
ing to any criminal practice or possible
later indictment by the Federal Grand
Jury exists, and it was further ascer
tained that most of the Government wit-*
nesses will be stenographers and ex
employes. Its star witness is said to be
a discredited employe, who now bears an
assumed name.
According to a report which comes
from a source near to headquarters the
Government will try to prove that the
packers are maintaining prices under an
agreement made in 1SS9 which provides
for a fine of $5000 for its violation. The
lowest rate fixed in the agreement is said
to be so- high that a. good profit is as
sured. A previous agreement, known as
the agreement of 1887, is said to .have as
sessed a fine of only $1000.
PACKERS TO BE CALLED.
Irt connection with these agreements
and reported secret meetings of pack
ers to arrange prices it was semi-officially
announced that Frank Vogel of Nelson.
Morris & Co., P. A. Valentine of Ar
mour & Co., and Louis F. Swift of Swift
& Co.. would be called as witnesses by
the Government. From another source
it was learned that It was the hope of
the prosecution by calling these men to
strengthen the accusations made by for
mer stenographers and confidential men
in the packers' employ.
As to any criminal prosecution an offi
cial of the Government is authority for
the information that under the bill for
equity such as the bill United States At
torney Bethea will file, the packers could
even come into court and freely admit
they had been parties to a trust or com
bine, and according to the constitution
evidence so admitted could not be used
against them in a criminal prosecution.
For that reason, said the same official,
thfi entire investigation of the beef ques
tion and filing of the bill of restraint can
ena only in the packers possibly .admit
ting .that they have In ways acted in re
straint of trade, but "would be good after
this and would not do so any more." and
the Government will be powerless to pun
ish them.
A well-known attorney in speaking of
the coming investigation and its outcome
said: "What has there been mentioned in
connection with the methods of the pack
ers that is in any way the basis for an
indictment? Absolutely nothing. There is
not an injunction that a living man can
draw up. an act of Congress or any ac
tion of court that can affect the price of
livestock and beef an eighth of a cent
other than it is being affected by the law
of supply and demand. How is the Gov
ernment going to show that the packers
have combined or conspired by extortion
or fraud to force prices? The Federal au
thorities will certainly ; have to do that
before any indictment will stick. The talk
about securing evidence to place before
the Federal Grand Jurv or of going-be
fore that body and indicting the leading
men in the business is nonsense."

An additional paper, called a builders'
agreement, is appended, in which tha

In return Harland & Wolff agree to
build no ships for any other firm but
those in the combine, except the Ham
burg-American line, provided the orders
of the combine keep the builders' works
fully and continuously employed.

All the purchase prices include the shipa
building. The White Star owners, though
declaring that the line has been carried
on entirely at the risk of the purchasers

the business of the line. For their per
sonal services the sellers "are to be paid
such amounts in remuneration as shall be

The following important clause occurs
at the end of the White Star agreement:
"Inasmuch as the company is English

GOVEBNOB IS INVITED.
The Union League Club of San Fran

honor of Governor Odell of New York.
The Governor is not sure at this time that
his engagements will allow him oppor

will know when he ar*iyes In San Fran

The statement that invitations haye been

his acceptance.
The Union League is. an Institution
maintained by Republicans for the pur
pose of supporting Republican principles
and promoting party success. Its mem

RECOVERY OF THE QTJEE1T
CAUSES THANKSGIVING
_ The shock of the earthquake was felt at
Souscnate. republic of Salvador, more than 500
miles away." â . Â¦ - , ..,
I was governess for the family of J. Apariclo,
who is a gentleman,' of much wealth and the
owner of much' property In the city of Quezal
temango. I was living at his home, which is
the finest residence in the city, being a beauti
ful three-story -structure. Like - most other
houses it has Its main entrance in the- center
of the house, but there was a side entrance
built out like an alcove. I afterward learned
the reason for having this side entrance.
We were nil inside nt. the time of the earth
quake and when It occurred I. made a rush for
the front door, but Mr. Aparlcio, taking me by
the arm, said: "Don't go out that door, or you
will sorely be killed." He then hurried me to
the side entrance with the others. Just as we
entered the side alcovo the house fell In, and
If I had been at the front door, for which I
had . started, . I surely would have been killed,
but as it was we all found ourselves perfectly
safe, as the heavy framework of the alcove
had withstood the shock. I was Informed that
these alcoves or side entrances were built es
pecially strong, and it was the custom in case
ot earthquakes, to stand underneath them. ThÂ»
entire town was destroyed and more than 500
persons lost their lives.
Miss Donoghue, telling of her thrilling
experience during the earthquake, said:
ESCAPE THROUGH ALCOVE.
Miss Cecilia Donoghue of 2523 California
street came up from Ocos on the New
port. She was in a three-story house in
an interior city on the night of the dis
turbance, and had a thrilling experience.
The top story was shaken down over the
heads of the people in the. house,', but
everybody escaped without a scratch.

meant to the people ashore."
TV. Hill, the attorney, and
Stephen Hill, his brother, swore to similar
allegations and told of the famous alley
way and back door entrance to Campbell's
office, by which'' people -enter, whose deal
ings with the "boss" a're to, be kept sub
W. N.Speegle, business manager of the
Standard, swore in his affidavit that he
was present : when Campbell and . Bull
sought to compel Thompson to agree to
resign the- Receivership of the Land Of
fice about. July lln consideration of the
withdrawal of their opposition to his-re
appointment.' .Senator. Selvage, .whose
ambition to go to Congress does not meet
with the: approval of Campbell's crowd,
for the reasons stated by Selvage, is gen
erally looked to by the people as a fearless
leader who will. help them overthrow ring
rule. . â¢ : "-' . â¢ . Â¦ . 'Â¦ ..Â¦Â¦"'.-
Campbell's dominance has been : com
plete and if- his devices do not fail a Gage
delegation, chosen by the County Commit
tee ' will go to the State~ convention and
he'will continue to name convention dele
gates and election boards, | fix the slate
for county and municipal elections and
control the parceling of. local patronage.
-His ODponents, however,- believe that the
department at Washington cannot ignore
the charges made against Campbell and
they are convinced that if a special agent
be sent to investigate enough of corrup
tion arid' offensive partisanship .will be
discovered to cause the removal even of
a man with' a .much stronger pull than
Campbell possesses. : .
That he has known Sterling Campbell, who is
now and has been for the past four years Col
lector of the port of Eureka, Cal.. 1 for eight or
ten years; that during the past few years, to
the knowledge of the affiant, the said- Sterling
Campbell has been an offensive partisan in pol
itics here, and in regard to that fact affiant Is
Informed and belitvea, and therefore alleges
upon such information and belief as follows:
That said Sterling Campbell has improperly
Intermeddled with the conduct of primary elec
tions In this county; that at Buch primary elec
tions he has put up .delegates 'who were pledged
to a large extent to do his bidding; that -he
uses money prior to and at such primary elec
tions to succeed In electing the said pledged
delegates; that with such delegates he claims
to control the Republican nomination for near
ly every important office in the county, and
even eoes bo far as to pledge the county dele
gation, to district or State conventions, to sup
port or to refuse to support any candidate for
nomination that he desires; that for his manip
ulation cf primaries and conventions he has
gained for himself the name of "Boss Camp
bell,".and his clique are known as the "push"
from one end ot this county to the other and
are so spoken of In San Francisco; that he and
his clique have become notorious and extremely
offensive to a large percentage of the voters of
this county, which fact had - almost disrupted
the local Republican organization here and has
set on foot a bitter factional fight. For said
reasons said Campbell is not a creditable repre
sentative of the Republicans of this community,
and is therefore not ,a â¢ proper person to hold
a place of trust or j honor at the hands of the
Government. ;-Â¦-; ..V , ! . . '. Â¦
W.' T. S. Hadley, an attorney and Ref
eree in Bankruptcy for Humboldt County
and for many years secretary of the Re
publican County Committee, made affi
davit to facts as follows regarding Camp
bell's political methods:
son and Mllnes was shortly afterward settled
and Campbell Informed me. that an agreement
had been entered Into with Gillette by whi<?h
the machine Si- Humboldt County would support
him against me for Congress. Campbell Is
now doing everything he possibly can do inter
viewing commltteemen and his. political lieu
tenants throughout the county, to secure alle
gation to the State Convention antagonistic to
my candidacy. _ - ". - ...
Carmack declared that Lodge was dis
honoring 'the American army and the
Americans by defending orders which
looked to. the murder of women and chil
dren. Such orders of deathâ a brutal and
inhuman orderâ could .not be justified by
anybody; yet these were the orders which
Senators had the "devilish impudence to
justify." ..;.-â¢â¢:?
Carmack delivered a denunciation of the
conduct of military operations in the Phil
ippines, and denounced General Smith, j
branding him as a "scoundrel" and "mur
derer" who had dishonored the American
army and had done nothing but butcher
a whole people.
Burton of Kansas concluded the speech
which he began yesterday. He referred,
as Instances of atrocious cruelty, to the
battle of Wounded Knee, to the Mountain
Meadow massacre, and to the massacre
of Union soldiers at Fort Pillow, and con
tended that, the .action of the American
troops in the Philippines was, in most
instances, entirely within the regulations
of civilized warfare.
good feeling was shown by the -active par
ticipants in "the war of wordsâ Dolllver
and Car mack â who cordially shook hands
and laughed over the encounter.

* !A. Eugene E.- Schmltz Club was organ
ized last night at 14 Third street for the
purpose of perpetuating the Twenty

dred members signed the roll. The f ollow
ins officers were chosen: President.
Thomas Dolan; vice president, P. M. Duf
fy; secretary, T. E. Butler; treasurer,
William Qulgley, and sergeant-at-arms.
Frank McGuire. Speeches were made in
which the administration of Mayor
Schmitz was commended. Political bosses
were denounced. Schmitz was mentioned
as a leader who would give the State a
clean administration.
Twenty-Eighth District ,Club.
The committee administered a rebuke to
the Board of Works by ordering the or
dinance reducing the . width of sidewalks
on Anthony street to ten feet to be amend-\
ed so that they will be restored to their
original width of thirteen feet. A. Aron
son complained that "he had bep n ordered
to tear out some underground work In his
building on the street named, although he
had been Informed by the board that the
sidewalks were thirteen feet wide. The
board subsequently Informed him that the
width had been reduced and the changes
would cost him $5000.
The Board of Works was authorized to
advertise for bids for the repair of bitu
minous pavements, at an estimated cost
of $20,000, and to pave Howard street be
tween Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth
streets.
J. T. Burke, representing the Southern
Pacific Company, informed the committee
that the corporation was desirous of hav
ing its engineers explain the route for
which a franchise has been asked for a
cut-off line from Sunnydale avenue to
Sixth street, and also to give information
as to the intended method of construc
tion. Consideration of the franchise was
postponed for one week to hear from the
residents of the Mission district as. to the
advisability of granting a franchise
through the Mission on the existing route.
Charles Wheeler appeared before the
committee in support of the petition of
property owners for. the opening of Lyon
street. Mr. Wheeler said that the estab
lished law is that Lyon street Is eighty
feet wide north of Union street, and per
sons occupying the street are obstruction
ists and should be removed. He advised
the city to purchase the so-called Miran
da grant, made in 1833 by the Mexican
Government, and tb make an appropria
tion in the budget for the purpose. The
committee decided to notify parties ob
structing the streets to appear before the
joint Committee on Judiciary and Streets
on May 16.
The Board of Works submitted a plat
showing obstructions on Lyon street. The
City Engineer says there has been some
contention as to the proper location of
Lyon street, and the question may again
be raised. It has been contended .that there
should be no deflection, but the deflected
â¢line has in recent Supreme Court deci
slonp been held to be correct. "
The Supervisors' â¢ Street Committee re
ported yesterday in favor of the recom
mendation of the Board of Public Works
that the Atchlson, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway Company be granted permission
to grade lands in the vicinity of Eight
eenth, and Minnesota . , streets. J John
Mooney, the only protestant against the
change of grades, stated that he would
sell his property at Eighteenth and Min
nesota streets to the railway company, for
$25,000. Captain A. ,H. Payson, represent
ing the corporation, said he would pay
$20,000 for Mooney's -property, although
the company did not require it. - Payson
as a^i alternative offered to pay $4000 for
damages to Mooney's property, but the
last namd declined to accept either offer.
The committee agreed that the offers
were fair and thought that the Improve
ment should begin at once. The plan in
cludes-the building of a foot bridge on
Nineteenth street, from Iowa to Minne
sota, a wagon bridge on. Twentieth street,
between Iowa and Tennessee, and a bridge
on Eighteenth street, from Iowa to Indi
ana streets. ..'-'Â¦ '

Intensive gardening. enables skillful teachers" to

their disposal. Trees as well as 'shrubs. and ,- small

In the cities, of course, the gardens are small. In
some cases they. do not exceed one-tenth of an acre,
but in such cases the cities provide larger central gar
dens from which specimens of plants are distributed
to the schools arid which are frequently visited by. the
pupils. Thus in Berlin there is a central garden of
ten acres, while at Breslau there is a combined gar
den and forest of 12,000 acres for school use: <
France, which by reason of her soil and her cli
mate is the ideal land of gardens, leads the van with
more than 30,000 school gardens in operation. Semi
barbarous Russia has upward ,of 10,000 village
school gardens. Cold and bleak Sweden has more
than 5000, and hardly a rural school in that king
dom is' without one. Switzerland does nearly as well
as Sweden, and _it is estimated that throughout
Europe there "are at this time more than 100,000 such
gardens,' not counting kindergartens.
By way of contributing information on the subject
the Boston Transcript has begun the publication of
a series of articles on the school gardens of Europe
and America. It appears that such gardens were es
tablished in Europe fully a hundred years ago, but
were originally directed and maintained by the own
ers of large estates, who wished to teach their ten
ants how to make the highest profit out of their
small bits of ground. When the benefits of the sys
tem were proven the Governments took up the work,
and now in every European country except Great
Britain there are extensive systems of school gar
dens, not only in the rural districts, but in the cities
as well.
WITH the coming of spring our Eastern
fellow countrymen, released from the bond
age of a hard winter, are taking a keen de
light in every form of plant that can be made. to bud
and blossom in their cities. As a part of that delight
they are interesting themselves in the establishment
of school gardens. It seems altogether probable
that as a result of the enthusiasm ton the subject
every progressive city in the East will, in a com
paratively short time have well managed gardens
of that kind. '' .. _ \ Â¦

After many futile efforts to devise a
method of classifying warships by nu
merical figures or value an approach to
success has been made. The strong point
In favor of the system proposed is that
the values assigned to a considerable
number of vessels under the rule laid
down correspond almost exactly with the
values given, by the foremost naval ex
perts. The new method is difficult of non
technical explanation, but some of the
results established by It are easily under
stood. The highest figure of merit is that

It is a good sign that Democratic Senators leave
the Senate when Tillman speaks. Perhaps the time
is not far distant when even South Carolina Democ
racy will turn its back on. him, and then the black
guard will cease to disgrace the Senate by his pres
ence as he offends it by his insoknea-
It seems to have been the intention of Tillman in
making the speech to convey the impression that the
Republican administration is treating the Filipinos
worse than the Democrats of South Carolina have
treated the negroes. Perhaps it is natural for him
to think so. He is himself so bitter and venomous
in his hatred of the negro that he cannot believe any
white man has respect for the rights of the colored
races. As Senator Burton said in replying to him:
"A man who upon this floor can defend slavery and
government by the shotgun cannot be expected to
think very well of Senators who arc trying to' carry
good government into the Philippines. It is astound
ing that /a Senator should make an appeal for hon
cst government in one breath and in the next boast
of crimes almost unparalleled in history." ;
Tillman felt the force of the retort and at once
burst forth in his old harangue against the negro.'
Once more he told how the negro vote in South
Carolina was suppressed and is still held in suppres
sion, and once more he virtually challenged Republi
cans to provide a remedy for the wrong. . He re
peated the story of the shotgun campaign and said
the whites had carried the election by 3000 majority
and might just as well have made it 30,000. Refer
ring to the so-called "sand cure" practiced by Amer
icans upon recalcitrant Filipinos, he said it is but
a mild method and added: "When we get ready to
put a nigger's face in the sand we put his body there,
too."
Senator McComas, in reply to an attack of Til
man and Money of Mississippi upon tÂ£e Philippine
policy of the administration, said: "We behold Sen
ators from the two States where there is less popu
lar liberty than in the. others shouting loudest for
constitutional liberty on the other side of the globe."
The statement was a fair hit. That wrong has been
done to negroes in Mississippi and South Carolina
does not of course justify wrong in the Philippines,
but it does furnish good reason' why those whp profit
by the wrong should not undertake to pose before
the American people as the special champions of jus
tice and make pretense of being the . defenders of
liberty against the assaults of better men than them
selves.
j Tillman's boast is that he is no hypocrite â that he
tells the truth. A similar boast might be made by
any blackguard who regards- courtesy as hypocrisy
and modesty as cowardice. He violates decency, and
he calls the violation a display of honesty. He vaunts
and brags of infamy as if it were an honor, and chal
lenges the Senate and the nation to silence him.
In his reply on Wednesday to Senator McComas
of Maryland Tillman became so offensive that we are
told most of the Democratic Senators left the
chamber, being unwilling to give even a tacit recog
nition to him as a representative of their party.
Nor can they.be blamed for doing so. Surely any
one with whom Tillman is associated even remotely
has occasion to be ashamed of it.
SO far from having been abashed by the em
phatic condemnation recently pronounced
upon him by' the Seriate arid ' by the well nigh
universal voice of the American people, Senator
Tillman appears to glory in liis shame. Not for a
single day has he by word or by manner shown any
contrition for the disgraceful attack made upon his
colleague, McLaurin, upon the floor of the Senate,
nor has he exhibited any respect for public senti
ment. On the contrary, he seems to find an ignoble
pleasure in continuing to offend against the rules of
the Senate and the decencies of discussion.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.*
PERSONAL MENTION.
O-, L. RICHARDS of El Reno, Okla., has what is, perhaps, the most valu
able Indian curio in existence and one which cannot be duplicated In
â¢ any collection > of relics of the: red men. It Is an elk teeth dress.
â¢ Richards has just purchased this garment from Mary Roman Nose,
nee Bent, granddaughter of the famous Colonel Bent and wife of a fam
ous Cheyenne brave. It is the most cherished heirloom of the Cheyenne tribÂ«
and has long been the envy of curio hunters in this country and abroad.
For more than a century it has been in the possession of the tribe to which
Mary Roman Nose belongs. Jn fact, it was originally owned by her great-grand
father, who counted It among his treasures. â¢ 'Â« '.
Â¦ It took Richards many months to induce her to close the bargain with him,
which left him $1600 poorer and Mary Roman Nose minus the famous dress. This
robe is ornamented with 1024 elk teeth, mostly gifts from great chiefs. Joseph,
the great Nez Perces chief:. the famous Black Kettle, Chief Red Moon, White
Shield, Stone Calf, Little Raven and a host of other red men who gained fame
for their .tribes on the warpath and in the hunt are represented in this garment.
Each one of these teeth has the chief's mark on it. When it Is remembered
that elks' teeth now bring from. $1 to $10, and that they are very scarce even at
the latter figure, and that to the Indians they represented so much wealth, the
value of this curious costume can be thoroughly appreciated.
Many- romances and a few tragedies are connected with this dress. ! Forty In
dian maidens, robed in the dress, have sworn allegiance to swarthy braves. It Is
held by the Indians that a maiden who becomes a squaw robed in it may feel
sure of holding forever the affection of the brave she weds.
The Agricultural Department estimates that up
ward of .15 per cent of allthe foodstuffs consumed in
this country are adulterated or mislabeled, and that
fully 2 per cent of the frauds are injurious to health.
Since American ingenuity has been cfever enough to
devise such frauds,. American law should be equal
to the task of preventing them.
After that statement Dr. Bigelow made another
which is of special interest to Californians: "It is
not generally known, I think, that it is possible to
import European oils into this country, ship them
across the country by rail and put them on the mar
ket at San Francisco at a lower price than that for
which the first grade of California olive oils can be
made."
Some interesting facts were gathered by Dr. Bige
low of the Bureau of Chemistry concerning the mis
branding of olive oils. In his testimony .before the
committee the doctor said: "The oils marked olive
that are brought into this country are very fre
quently adulterated with peanut and sesame oils.
They are also said to add in foreign countries sun
flower and mustard oils, but \yc have not found them.
We have found only peanut and sesame oils in our
investigations of those 'olive oils.' Here is a label
which recalls a very interesting interview I had with
a clerk in Buffalo. They had two brands of 'olive
oil/ as they were marked. One was American, they
said. The other was imported., They looked very
much alike. I asked the clerk if he could give me a
quart bottle of the imported oil. He said he could
bottle me one. I asked if his firm; bottled it them
selves. He said yes, and finally admitted 'that those
two supplies of oil were bottled from the v same bar
rel and that they were both cottonseed oil. The bot
tle he sold me was labeled 'Olive oil put up by
Freres duPeaux, Bordeaux, France.' "
Some interesting recipes are given for making
fine liquors. Thus if brandy be desired the recipe
says: "To forty gallons of colored French spirits
add two ounces of brandy oil, mix well and add one
quart of white syrup or glycerine. To imitate any
particular brand add. a small quantity of the kind to
be imitated. About three gallons to forty will an
swer the purpose." A recipe for Rhine wine says:
"Mix one pound of essence in three gallons of proof
spirits and add to tliirty-seven\gallons of rectified
cider; then dissolve a pound of 'Â¦ tartaric acid in a
half-gallon of hot water and add to suit taste." The
country is full of the kind of brandy made by that
recipe, and it is said the wine recipe shows us how
is made "about one-half the Rhine wine that is used
in the United States."
It appears from the facts cited by the Senator that
even the cheapest foods are subject -to fraud. Dried
codfish is not a costly article, and yet a still cheaper
fish is put up like it, labeled "choice codfish" and
sold in the market as the genuine article. Some
times the frauds are ingenious. Thus the market is
full of genuine vanilla"" beans from which all the
vanilla has been extracted, and the oil of nutmegs is
extracted by a clever process, the punctures filled
with' lime solution and the nutmegs pat upon the
market again. Apple cores arid peeling are used to
make strawberry jelly because apples are cheaper
than strawberries, but the apple does not escape, for
as pumpkins are cheaper still they are used in making
apple butter.
SENATOR McCUMBER in a recent speech on
the pure food bill now before Congress pre
sented a new array of facts obtained by Gov
ernment experts showing the' extent to which food
adulterations, imitations, and misbranding are prac
ticed by unscrupulous dealers. They reveal also the
difficulty that the producers of honest foods have
in finding a market for. their products in the face
of such illegitimate competition, and as a conse
quence are matters of concern to growers and to le
gitimate manufacturers as well as to consumers, "<, %

With regard to his novels, Benson ad
mits that the characters are very often a
reproduction of people In real life, only
the features being altered. His next novel
is to be called "A Book of Months." It
will be an autobiographical story of a
man's life for a year, told in a .series of
monthly sections. He has already writ
ten the story for three months, but it is
unlikely that the book will bÂ© published
till the spring of next year. Meanwhlla
it Is probable that either during the sum
mer or early In the autamn Benson's first
play willbe produced by Mrs. Patrick
Campbell. Its motive Is; a version of
Browning's poem, "A Light Woman." A
woman, to save her niece from what she
considers a worthless man, steps between
them, draws the man away and falls la
love with him herself. ' V
, E. F. Benson, whose "Scarlet* and Hys
sop" has been one of the principal suc
cesses for years past, has shaken the dust
of London from his feet, forsaking: so
ciety, whose vices he has so mercilessly
attacked, and has settled at Winchester
for the summer. Benson is a very keen
athlete and at Winchester finds plenty of
opportunities for cricket and golt. Inci
dentally, he is editing with Eustace Miles
a new series of sporting handbooks which
Hurst. & Blackett are to publish, under
the general title of "The Imperial Books
of Sport." They will have the distinction
of being largely written by professionals.
The first three volumes will deal .with
training, which will be partly written by
"Benson himself; cricket, .to which Abel,
Hirst and Mead are contributing, and
golf, the chapters of which arÂ© being -writ
ten .by well-known professional players.
Yet In another quarter there is another
trade taken in hand by this versatile au
thor. He contributes to the "Grocers' As
sistants' Year Book" an expression of
sympathy with shop assistants. "It is no
abstract sympathy. I was In the net (my
self for two years, the most miserable
years of my life. I was behind the coun
ter in a draper's shop. Had I not been
able to believe there wa9 a way out of.
the systematized drudgery I would quite
deliberately have got out of the world
that could misuse me so."
Assuredly one of the men of t>*<-- moment
in literature la H. G. "Wells. Glancing
through some of the publishers' lists th!3
morning I see no fewer than four recent
boolcs of his mentioned. These are "An
ticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical
and Scientific Progress Upon Human
Life," "Thoughts on Certain Personal
Matters." "The Discovery of the Future"
and "The First Men In the Moon."
But .this is not to have done with Wells,
for in a publication entitled "Men's "Wear"
I find thte pronouncement of that writer
on the tailors' and outfitters' industry:
"How delightful it would be to. find a
tailor wide-minded enough to talk about
medieval and classical costume In rela
tion to the social condition in which it
was evolved."
A postponement of the measure from this- session
to the next would expose the bill to the hazard of
a. still further postponement, for the next session will
be short. - Moreover, the question might then be
come involved in the partisan conflicts of the Presi
dential election. It is of course desirable to avoid
such contingencies. The people have had experience
enough of the evil effects of making money ques
tions a part of the political issues which divide the
people. Prolonged agitations on ' such matters se
riously interfere with commerce and industry and
cause great hardships in many cases. This, then, is
the time to deal with the currency problem, and
strong pressure should be put upon Congress to have
it settled by the adoption of the Fowler bill before
adjournment
The bill has received the cordial indorsement of
the executive committee of the Indianapolis Mone
tary Convention and represents the best thought of
the ablest financial experts of the Union. It offers a
substantial improvement in our financial system, and
its benefits will- affect all classes of people.
The Fowler bill, now before the House, includes
the vital points of the maintenance of the parity of
our metallic currency by redeeming silver coin in
gold and of providing an ample credit currency by
conservative gradual steps. The provisions made in
that respect are in keeping with the pledges of the
Republican party in the Philadelphia platform, and
have met with the approval of financiers in all parts
of the country. As the bill provides for the reduc
tion of denominations of silver certificates gold can
be paid out for silver without requiring any increase
in the gold reserve provided by the law of 1900, and
until that machinery is provided.and the maintenance
of parity secured there will be always more or less
money agitatfon to disturb our financial credit.
We are enjoying such a degree of universal pros
perity at the present time. There is no mo.ney
stringency in any part of the country arid no im
mediate danger of the occurrence of one. As was
said by Secretary Gage shortly before his retire
ment: "Looked at from the point of true states
manship it would appear that the present is the most
propitious hour in all our history and as favorable as
any period we may hope for in the future to enter
upon reasonable and judicious measures to eliminate
all elements of financial weakness which experience
has brought to light and to perfect our now faulty
system 'of currency."
Each of the bills stated is in some respects- a
measure of urgency, for the conditions of com
merce and industry call for them all. There
are, however, special reasons, why the currency bill
should be acted upon at' this session. It is well
known that finance is the most sensitive fiber in the
social organism. It is that which is most easily dis
arranged, and when disordered produces the most
widespread disturbances. Any change thatjs to be
made in the currency of a country ought to be made
in times of prosperity, when industry is on a firm
basis, commerce flourishing and every condition of
the people so sound and secure that there will be
no danger of a panic or other disaster during the
period that the change is being carried out.
WHEN the present session of Congress be
gan there was Â¦'every prospect, that a com
prehensive bill dealing with the currency
problems of the country would' be promptly en
acted.: Later on Chairman Fowler of the House
Committee on Banking and Currency announced
that he was sanguine the House would give imme
diate consideration to a measure to that effect re
ported favorably from his committee. Of late, how
ever, the outlook has been by no means so promis
ing. Bad management on the part of some of the
leaders of the majority has complicated the situation.
At the present time the isthmian canal bill, the mer
chant marine, bill and the currency bill are seemingly
sidetracked, and unless earnest efforts be made to
procure action upon them they may be passed over
to the next session. .

"The whole world owes Blavatsky a
debt of gratitude as one of Its redeemers.
While the few may be tardy in acknowl
edgment of her as one of humanity's
helpers the masses have already begun to
recognize her as such. The souls of men
are awakening to the Inspiring conscious
ness that they are divine; that the only
thing to fear is wrongdoing; that what
men call 'evil" Is the result of their own
Ignorance and selfishness in the present
or in past lives, and that each man as
a divine soul is the supreme arbitrator of
his own destiny and has the opportunity
to make that destiny godlike by thought
and deeds of unselfish service for his
brother souls."

Throughout the day people from all di

Lastly, shun bad company; avoid the com
panionship of corrupt boys and girls. One
corrupt and vicious boy or girl is sufficient to
ruin hundreds. Just as one drop of ink let
fall into a glass of clear, pure water will black
en the whole glassful, so one vicious youth
can blacken and taint the virtue of hundreds
cf boys and girls.
Secondly, avoid the reading of dangerous
publications which appear in the form of dime
novels and certain pictorial newspapers. As
ycu would destroy the eggs of serpents because
they bring forth young serpents that would
sting you to death, so you should destroy bad
books because they beget sins that kill the
soul. Bad publications are the most effectual
means In the hands of Satan for the ruin of
souls.
On this beautiful May morning of your first
communion you should resolve first, to receive
the holy eucharist frequently, for "unless you
eai of the flesh of the Son of man and drink
of his blood you shall not have life In you."
PASTOR ADVISES YOUTH.
My D*>ar Children: You have Just now re
ceived your first holy communion, or In other
words you have received the holy eucharlst.
which contains the body and blood, soul and
divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ under the
appearance of bread and wine. Therefore your
Joy and happiness should be exceedingly great
today. Did a King or a Queen or the Presi
dent of the United States pay you a visit In
your homes you would feel highly honored,,
bur how highly honored should you feel this
morning, for . your souls have been visited by
your Redeemer, who is the King of kings, the
Lord of lords and the Creator of the heavens
and the earth.

KILL THE DANDBUET GEBM
Or Your Hair "Will Fall Out Till You
Modern science has discovered that
dandruff Is caused by a germ that digs up
the scalp in scales as It burrows down to
the roots of the hair, -where it destroys
the hair's vitality, causing falling hair
and ultimately baldness. After Professor
Unna of Hamburg, Germany, discovered
the dandruff germ all efforts to find a
remedy failed until the great laboratory
discovery was made which resulted In
Newbro's Herpicide. It alone of all other
hair preparations kills the dandruff germ.
Without dandruff, hair grows luxuriantly.

Miss Frances Graham sang a selection

greatly enjoyed. Mile. Carita followed
with some -dextrous tricks, and then
Raymond and Caverly, German jesters,
from the Oroheum, rode in on an elec

conductor and -mbtorman proceeded to
amuse the audience with parodies and

cessful. Miss Louise Dresser was given
a warm reception and she rendered a
number of songs.
Cooper, in a stunning pink gown, ren
dered two popular songs. Her encore
brought forth two Dickanlnnies dressed
for a marriage ceremony, and the au

NATIONAL LEAGUE.
It is the prevailing opinion here that
unless the operators agree to arbitration
or make some . counter proposition which
will conta'in a substantial concession. the
committee of miners will declare for a
strike. ' - -Â¦;.. -'
To-night a telegram was received
through a private source stating that Sen
ator Hanna had declared unequivocally
that the report that arbitration had been
refused by the operators was not true. ,
Telegrams announcing this action were
sent to the presidents of the nine big coal
collieries and several officers of the Civic
Federation. President Mitchell declined
to make public the full text of the tele
grams. â¢ ' " . Â¦.â¢-..-...- â¢
The executive committee of the anthracite
mine workers' organization have proposed that
all questions at issue between themselves and
the anthracite mine operators be submitted to
an impartial board of arbitration, such board
to be selected by the industrial . branch of the
National Civic Federation. This proposition has
been sent to the operators by wire. .The com
mittees are now awaiting replies. .
This proposal was evidently agreed upon
informally during the night, for it was
only forty-five minutes from the time the
meeting convened until .the adjournment.
President Mitchell at the close of the ses
sion gave out the following statement:
SCR ANTON/ Pa., May: 8.-To-night the
situation in the threatened miners' strike
hangs pn answers that are expected to
come , to a proposal â¢ of Â¦ arbitration em
anating from this morning's session of
the miners', convention. . : -
ALBANY, N. Y., May 8.â Judge Earl,
referee in the matter of the constitution
ality of the New York State franchise tax
law, declarers the . law â¢ constitutional on
every point. The case is still to be- passed
upon by the appellate division of the.Su
preme Court and the Court of Appeals.
The special, franchise tax law ,was
passed in 18S9. In effect it declares that
corporation franchises are/ property and
must be taxed as such. Under the law
valuations of speclafVtranchlses are fixed
by the State Tax Commissioners. J
The amount of the assessment- involved
in these proceedings is $137,000,000. Forty
millions of this is property which under
the old regime was taxed by/ the local as
sessors. The total propertyiof this char
acter throughout the State is $266,000,000.
The amount of real estate as distin
guished from the naked franchises con
tained In this amount exceeds $100,000.
Judge Brarl â¢ takes up four' propositions
in his review of the law: 'First, conflict
with the State constitution on home rule;
second, confliclT with the Federal consti
tution; third, on impairing/ contracts and
Incompatibility of the law 'with , other tax
statutes,. in that the value of a franchise
for use of a street cannot be separated
from other property values; fourth, "gen
eral objections to the method of determin
ing values. On all^of these pfelnts he dis
sents from the objections and finds for
the State. - - .1 Â¦ Â¦

SALT LAKE, Utah. May 8.â A move
ment has been started among the sport
lovers of this city to organize a club and
offer a purse to Jim Jeffries and Bob
Fitzsimmons to meet here in ia twenty
round contest during the Elks* National
Convention in August. It is the intention
to offer the heavy-weights a purse of $20,
000. If successful in getting the signatures
of the men for a contest here it is planned
to have the fight take place in the oval
of the Salt Palace saucer track, the ring
to be located out in the center in the
open. The seating capacity of the amphi
theater can easily be made twenty thou
sand, and with the vast crowds . that will
be here from all over the country' to at
tend the Elks* meeting no question of the
financial success of the undertaking is
entertained.

FRANCHISE TAX
LAW IS UPHELD
THE Columbia Theater has never
held a more select or apprecia
tive audience than that of yes
terday afternoon which applaud
ed the efforts of those who will
ingly gave their services to aid the Act
ors' Home, which was dedicated in New
York yesterday. By their attendance
theater-goers added $2000 to the fund that
has been raised .to advance this worthy
charity.
Four solid hours of comedy, singing,
comic opera and^ vaudeville was served
up for the entertainment of the audience.
Interspersed was a speech by. Milton No
bles, which was a classic in itself. The
entertainment went through -without a
hitch, owine to the able work -of L. E.
Woodthorpe and his assistants.
Promptly at 1:30 o'clock the curtain rose
on the third act of "The Two Escutch
eons," splendidly played by the Alcazar
Stock Company. The members of the
organization threw themselves Into their
lines and never were their efforts more
appreciated. It was a fitting introduc
tion for what followed. Miss Georgie
MINERS STRIKE
MAY BE AVERTED
The committee having the affair in
hand worked energetically and Its efforts
were crowned with success. Milton No
bles and Ralph Pincus did excellent works
Selby Oppenheimer gathered the volun
teers together and sent them on their way
rejoicing in rubber-tired carriages; the
men behind the scenes worked like beav
ers setting the stage for acts of every
kind, and the musicians played with un
usual interest in their work. 1 As a re
sult of their services a large sum will
be sent to Al Hayman, president of the
Actors' "Home Fund. . â¢

were accorded five curtain calls. Arthur
Cunningham, of the Tivoli, next sang.
He rendered a number of good songs.
Edward Harrigan and company came
from the Grand Opera-house to play a
scene from "Old Lavender." Mr. Harri
pan rendered two songs that were well
received. The Florpdora sextet of chil
dren, from the Central Theater, was put
on too late in the programme, but the
little ones scored their usual hit. The
Hoste eccentric acrobats, f 1 om
the Orpheum, completed one of the best
benefit programmes ever : given in this
city.
Los Angeles is well represented in San
Francisco at this time if there are to be
any negotiations to-morrow. Manager
Morley of the ball club and Al Levy and
L. J. Christopher, all of whom are in the
Century Athletic Club, are in the northern
city.
Among the local talent who follow the
movements of the men in the squared
circle, the latest ultimatum of Fitzsim
mons is something of a puzzle and is in
terpreted to mean that he may. be looking
for a hole to crawl through. About the mid
dle of 'April Fitzsimmons sent a telegram
offering to meet Jeffries at-any lime or
place in California that Jeffrie^might
name. He no sooner gets in this State
than he becomes dictatorial again, for
getting that it is not his right to have all
the say In the matter. There is a general
impression that Jim Kennedy may have
been advising Fitzsimmons since the Cor-'
nishman's arrival in San Francisco . and
have put the idea, into Fitzsimmons' head
that there is nothing to be looked for in
this city. ,
There is an added proviso to this state
ment that the 'proposition of the San
Francisco club which handles the contest
shall be such as the participants shall se
cure as much net as the Los Angeles
proposition will give them. The Los An
geles proposal is a flat offer of $25,000 guar
anteed, with an alternative of 80 per cent
of the gross receipts.
LOS ANGELES, May S.â "Just say that
I will meet Fitzsimmons in San Fran
cisco," was all Jim Jeffries would say to
night when he was informed that the
Cornishman would limit his activities to
San Francisco.

OAKLAND.
Hannivan accepted an almost impossi
ble chance of Walters' foul drive in the
first. The ball was about to drop in short
left field when Hannivan got there with
one mitt and made one of the prettiest
catches seen on the local field this year.
Mohler played his u^ual brilliant game at
second, while Toman was there with his
usual errors. Mohler stole second wiiile
McPartlln held the ball in the first. It
was a daring play and the little fellow
made a great slide past Raymer, who
had the ball and was waiting to tag him.
The score:
The feature of the game was House
holder's" batting. Out of five .times up he
secured three two-cushion swipes and a
single. Raj'mer got three -hits and - four
runs. Old Pete Lohman was again in
great form, and only one Angel stole sec
ond on him.
It all happened in the fifth. Oakland
was getting into the game and doing
things to Slowball McPartlin. They
chased three over the route when the con
flagration occurred. Some were unkind
enough to lay the blame on Morley be
cause he thought Ewing would win out,
while others thought Waddell did the
<3amge so that he could show the multi
tude how he used to fight fires in Mis
souri. â¢ , , ,
At all events the Rube made good in
doing fireman's stunts. He had Fitzpat
rick beat a block. He carried the water
buekets with both hands and then sig
naled to the man behind the bar to bring
forth the beer, as the water supply was
running low. The bartender refused to
comply with Rube's request, so the rest
of the bunch compromised by putting on
the hose, and the only lively incident of
the contest was spoiled.
The Angels mistook Hodson for a ping
pong server, and swatted his offerings to
the four ends of the lot. They hit safely
three times in the initial trial, and Toman
ecored. With three on the sacks in the
third. Householder drove a two-bagger to
left, and they all came in. A couple more
safe taps brought in two more, and made
the scorfe 6 to L
Morley' s men completed their run-get
ting in the fifth and sixth by bunching a
few more hits at opportune times. They
seemed to land on Hodson at will, and al
ways put the ball -vtaere the fielders could
not put their mitts near It.
The fire spoiled Oakland's chances.
They had just begun to discover what
Slowball's delivery looked like, and were
making him look like an empty beer
schooner, when the fire happened and put
the kibosh on the good work. However,
they succeeded in landing one in the first
and three in the fifth.
The last two tallies happened in Oak
land's half of the sixth, and in a rather
peculiar manner. Schmidt doubled to left
field and Gorton followed with one that
resembled Schmidt's, even to the bound
it took. Gorton soon after came in on
Walters' hit to right, which put an end to
the making of runs.
It was Morley day at Recreation Park
yesterday. His men won the game and
put out the fire. The Angels landed on
Hodson for only fifteen hits in six in
nings, and to make the game interesting
some enterprising gent set fire to the pad
ded backstop. An excited individual yelled
"Fire! 5 ' and the official scorer ran from
the grounds and tore up Eighth street.
He was brought back in a cab and play
was resumed.
Fitzsimmons was on the streets yester
day renewing old acquaintances. He has
a fresh, youthful appearance and is full
of boyish spirits. He claims he is a bet
ter fighter to-day than he was twenty
years ago. He knows the game better in
all its departments, having made a care
ful study of boxing in recent years. Te
praises the modern system of training,
which builds up a man's vitality. In for
mer times ponderous muscles were devel
oped, but at the expense of the boxer's
vitality, that intangible quality which can
neither be seen or measured, but which
plays so important a part in all contests
In which men or horses take part
It needs only a few minutes' conversa
tion with Fitzsimmons to see he is in
earnest about the matter. He claims that
had Jeffries accepted the Charleston Ex
position management's offer quickly there
would have been no opposition. Accord
ing to Fitzsimmons, the Governor of
South Carolina had told the exposition
people to go ahead and arrange the
match. When there was so much talk
about it the Governor could not withstand
the pressure and gave out the statement
that he would not permit the fight.
The opinion was freely expressed among
sporting men yesterday that, the manly
thing for Jeffries to do would be to board
the first train for this city and talk over
the match. When the men. were separated
by the width of the continent they carried
on a long-distance talking match of
which the public grew tired. If Jeffries
determines to stay in the south the pros
pects are good for a repetition of the con
troversy.
Matters seem to be ,at a serio-comic
deadlock, as Fitzsimmons refuses to con
duct any negotiations through Billy De
laney, Jeffries' manager, blaming the lat
ter for placing him- in the position before
the public of having avoided the oppor
tunity of making a match. Fitzsimmons
will not make the pilgrimage to Los An
geles, believing he has shown his earnest
ness in the matter by coming across the
continent. -
No progress was made yesterday in the
negotiations for a ftght between Jeffries
and Fitzsimmons.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 8.â At to-day's
session of the Association of Police Chiefs
of the United States and Canada, Presi
dent Sylvester read letters from numer
ous prominent police officials in foreign
countries and the English, Chinese and
Spanish Ministers at Washington, indors
ing the work of the association. All the
European police officials are heartily in
favor of an international bureau of-iden
tification. On motion of Chief Dietach of
Cincinnati, all the foreigners were ten
dered a vote of thanks.
At the meeting of the board of directors
of the Bureau of Identification, Colonel
Phil Deitsch of Cincinnati was re-elected
president and E. A. Evans of Chicago su
perintendent. Colonel Deitsch read his
annual report, showing the good results
secured by the use of the Bertlllon sys
tem. It was decided that the Bertlllon
clerks of the various- police departments
should meet in Washington, D. C, to
agree upon a uniform method of measur
ing criminals. Another meeting of the
board will be held to-night, when papers
will be read on professional criminals.
Chief Kiely of St. Louis read a paper on
"Can Criminals Reform?" holding that
they could be reformed.
Chief of Police Francis O'Neill of Chi
cago read a paper on "Anarchy and An
archists." He said the American an
archists were much like the Russian ni
hilists. He said there were a great num
ber of anarchists in Chicago, but they
were no longer defiant and they were abla
to make no moves which, were not known
to the police. He regarded Emma Gold
man as one of the most dangerous and
magnetic anarchists in the world and re
garded her as being responsible for Presi
dent McKinley's assassination.
Chief William Price of Vlcksburg. MI33.,
contended in his address that hardened
criminals could not be reformed.
A paper on "Anarchy and Anarchists,"
by Roderick Ross. Chief of- the Edin
burgh (Scotland) Constabulary, was read
by Secretary Carr. Ross believed in the
confinement of anarchists until they were
willing to abide by the ' law. and said
that those* who incited others to crimo
should be confined for life.
Chief of police Henry Muth of Alle
gheny, speaking on "Crime," said that
the opium habit is responsible for mor*
crime than any other vice.
Afte? listening to the reading of several
other papers the convention adjourned un

not prove fatal. There is no clew to her

Hughes' address was -well received and

subject. He was warmly applauded and
his words were then discussed briefly.
Superintendent Foshay of Los Angeles
made a short address on some observa
tions made during the attendance at the
national convention of superlntendentsTe
cently held in Chicago. Resolutions were
reported and adopted Indorsing the or
ganization of the California State Teach
ers' Federation; requesting the Legisla
ture to give the State Board of Educa
tion the power and means to provide a bet
ter series of text books; Indorsing pro
posed amendment No. 4 to the constitu
tion, advocating changes in the high
school system, and thanking everybody
who has contributed to the success of the
convention. Other resolutions â¢ urging
changes in the school laws of the- Statu
were also adopted. At 5 o'clock the con
vention adjourned. . â¢ '
Superintendent Hughes of Alameda then
addressed the convention on the advant
ages and disadvantages of departmental
work. He placed emphasis on the fact
that the teacher must at all times work
with the pupil, thus leading him on to
independence. /The material must be
given to the pupil in Its most interesting
form and the teacher must be an enthu
siast. Hence, specialization, which has
been long recognized as being necessary
in universities and colleges, will soon be
required in high and grammar schools.

TO CONFER' THEIR DEGREE
fornia, were married clandestinely in San
Jose more than two months ago. Their
secret was well guarded by themselves
and a few sworn friends up till to-day. â¢
The ceremony was performed in the
Garden City on February 22, Rev. Father
Land of St. Patrick's Church officiating.
After the marriage the bride remained at
her San Jose home with her parents and
young Jones returned to his studies at
Berkeley. On April 16 he was joined by
his wife, but they still kept their wed
ding secret, as Jones did not wish his
college chums to know about It until he
had finished his university work and ex
aminations. Â¦ ' .
Behind the romance is a tale of parental
objection which brought about the usual
resultâ a clandestine marriage, sooner than
either of the persona concerned had con
templated entering the state of matrimony.
Jones met his present wife four years ago
while she was a student at the local high
school and he was attending college, and
their troth was plighted soon 'afterward.
Mrs. Jones' parents were, not informed
until a recent date of their daughter'3
marriage. - â¢ .
Mrs. Jones is the youngest daughter of
John Mackey, a wealthy land and cattle
owner of Humboldt County, who is at
present residing at 374 South Sixth street,
San Jcse. Jones' home is in Sacramento,
and 'there he will take his wife as soon
as college closes. Both young people havo

and turned to resume his examination of

tlie spectators and attorneys in the court
room by saying to the lawyer:
"No, Mr. McGraw, I do not chew."

When Attorney E. - W. McGraw, after
whispering to Courtroom Clerk .Richard
Welsh and Court Reporter Holland, lean

room expected that something of great

I Mra. Pereira had made an'appointment to be
hero, this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock to have
8i,mÂ»i: teeth extracted. He% daughter had been
a patient of mine, but this was the first time
I had treated her^mother. When Mrs. Pereira
came she told me that she had suffered Intense
ly from toothache last night, and she desired
that the aching -teeth should be extracted.
\ After she had taken her place in the operat
ing, chair I made ordinary preparations for the
operation. There was no gas or ether, admin
istered, . only a local application of cocaine..
It was Just after I had removed the fourth
tooth that she suddenly cried. "Oh, my heart!"
and collapsed. At first I thought she had only
fainted, as patients sometimes do under ex
tracting operations. I got some whisky and
administered it, aflso trying artificial respira
tion, but she showed no signs of reviving.
Then I called Dr. Goldson. a, woman physician
next door, and Dr. Hornef and Dr. Hyde, who
were In my other offices, also came in. Later
Dr. L.arkey was summoned.. Every effort to
restore the" lady was made, but the doctors
wore finally compelled to declare that she was
dead. ; .
SUBJECT TO HEART TROUBLE.
,_ Under the circumstances I could do nothing
else but notify- the Coroner, which I did
promptly. ;My distress over this unfortunate
affair is very great, but I feel that it was such
an occurrence that could not be foreseen or in
any manner forestalled. After her v death, I
learned that Mrs. Pereira had been subject Â¦ to
spasms, evidently due to weakened action of
the heart. ' . :
Her death occurred about 0:30 o'clock, be
cause she had been at the office an hour when
she collapsed.
"Miss Pereira told me that her mother
had been subject to frequent attacks of
heart trouble," said Dr. S. C. Hornef.
"The indications are that heart disease
was the cause of her sudden collapse and
death."
The .Pereiras have resided for several
years in this city. The family is prom
inent among the and South
American colonies' in San Francisco.
Madame Pereira was a native of Chile
and 41 years of age. The funeral will be
held Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock from
the family residence. The body will prob
ably be placed in a receiving vault and
later sent to Chile.
Coroner Mehrmann will hold an Inquest
Saturday evening.
Dr. Schmidt was greatly distressed over
the untefward demise of hi3 patient. He
said the sudden collapse was the first sug
gestion of anything wrong.
Consul Pereira Â¦was overcome with grief
and with his motherless daughter retired
to their residence, 961 Madison street,
stunned by the sudden blow.
A post mortem examination will be
necessary to definitely determine the
cause of death. Miss Pereira told the
dentist's associates that her "mother had
been subject to attacks of heart trouble.
ONT/S" COCAINE USED.
Distressing as was the sudden death, it
was rendered doubly shocking because of
the presence of Miss Marie T. Pereira, a
young ' daughter, who was ' summoned
from an anteroom in the dentist's office
only to learn , that her mother had ex
pired while the young woman was await
ing the dentist's word that he had dons
with the operation.
While the three physicians were work
ing over the patient Dr. A. S. Larkey, the
Pereiras' I family attendant, arrived, he
also having been called. * After it was all
over the husband was summoned from
San Francisco and he reached the office
Just as his wife's body was being removed
to the Morgue, Dr. Schmidt having noti
fied the Coroner as soon as Mrs. Pereira
was pronounced dead.
Dr. Schmidt had removed four teeth
from his patient's mouth and was about
to : renew extracting when Madame Pe
reira "raised her head, clutching at her
heart with an . exclamation of pain/ and
then collapsed.' .Realizing that the lady
was: in 7a: serious condition, the dentist
called for assistance. Quickly Dr. W. H.
Goldson, Dr. O. C. Hyde and* Dr. S. C.
Hornef : responded. Whisky and strych
nine were administered, but the patient
was beyond medical attention. She had
expired, almost before she could be lifted
from the operating chair.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
y - 1118 Broadway, May 8.
While having teeth extracted this after
noon at the office of Dr. Gustav L.
Schmidt, a dentist, at 1014 Broadway,,
Madame Maria Teresa deAstorga Pereira,
wife of Juan A. 'Pereira, Consul for Chile
at San Francisco, expired suddenly in the
operating chair in the midst j of the den
tist's work.
The Oakland Federated Trades Council,
which is the central body recognized by
-the carpenters, is going to try and orga
nize local plasterers' and plumbers' un
ions in opposition to those unions that
have stood by the Building Trades Coun
cil, and the Building Trades Council has
a plan for an opposition carpenters' union.
But ihe Building Trades Council ha3
taken the bit In Its teeth and has adopted
resolutions declaring that no members of
unions affiliated with the Alameda Coun
ty Building Trades Council will be per
mitted to work with those who do not
hold the regular quarterly working cardd
of the State Building Trades Council. The
date for I the enforcement of this order
has been set for May 17. As members of
the Carpenters' Union do not hold these
cards this means that the members of the
Building Trades Council will not longer
recognize them as union men.
The war that is on between, the San
Francisco Building Trades Council and
the; Carpenters' Union has extended to
this city. The Building Trades Council
and the carpenters have been at out3 for
some time, the carpenters having with
drawn from the Building, Trades Council
and recognized the American Federation
of Labor, but up to the present time each
side has recognized the other as being
union, and men representing the two sides
have worked side by side upon the same
buildings.
Oakland Office San , Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 8.
Mr. Lane admitted having made the
statement that the Mayor had asked him
to hold the suits in abeyance pending a
compromise.
Mr. Lane said the cases against the
telephone company were now pending,
that they had come up before* Judge
Hebbard. and that in the near / future
they would be brought up again before
Judge Seweil.
"Certainly not. I have not been In
communication vritb the telephone com
pany, nor it -with me, regarding a com
promise in this affair. The matter is now
in the courts."
"Has the telephone company approached
you cr has it tried to approach you in re
gard to a compromise by giving- the. mu
nicipality free telephone service?" he was
asked.
W. N. McCarthy has waxed wroth over
the interminable delay and he expresses
a determination as a citizen to have the
suits brought to trial.
Mayor Schmitx"s time was pretty well
taken up yesterday afternoon in receiving
and talking with the committee that had
come down to escort him to Vallejo to,
address ice Federal Labor Union there. >
On bein? approached on the subject of
the taxes due the city by the Sunset Tele
phone and Telegraph Company he said
that the matter was pending in the courts
and was at present not within his juris- j
-^diction. .. .... ,.. _. ..*- , ... - J
The cases against the telephone com
pany came up again and again and were
a5 many times continued.
The Tax Collector then appointed an at
torney to file suit for the collection of
the taxes, but the Supervisors discovered
later that it was not in the province of
the Tax Collector to make such an ap
pointment and the matter was placed in
the hands of Mr. Lane.
Resolutions tvere also Adopted at that
lime by the Supervisors to have the Tax
Collector gather in the taxes due the
municipality from the telephone company.
On April 20, 1900, the members of the
Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance
to license the Sunset Company's tele
phones at 50 cents a quarter, the ordinance
rea-iing- the same as that In force in Utah.
Second Section, Iv'o. 48, page 123 â For each
proprietor of a weighiEg machine, phonographic
machine, fortune telling machine, lifting ma
chine, music machine, electric machine or any
otter machine or apparatus of any kind, char
acter or description In which on deposit of a
5-cent piece or any other piece of money or
article representing money within said ma
chine a person Is -weighed thereon or music
piajed therein or other service* in connection
with said machine so designated are rendered
shall pay a license cf $2 per quarter for each
machine so used.
The suits seem to have been practically
sidetracked. From time to time the hear
ings have been continued by Judge Heb
bard, there seeming to be no one 10 press
them. The Tax Collector was instructed
to bring the suits and he employed as
ppecial counsel Peter F. Dunne. Mr.
Dunne was subsequently relieved of the
responsibility and tne matter fell back
into the hands of City Attorney Lane.
As far back as 1S80 there went into ef
fect in the general orders of the Board
of Supervisors an ordinance regarding the
taxing of electric machines which reads
as follows:
Mayor Schmitz says with emphasis that
be made no such request of Mr. Lane;
that he has made nor received no over
tures for & compromise with the telephone
company and that he has never even
heard any suggestion that a compromise
be made.
The continued delay In pressing the
suits against tlie Sunset Telephone and
Telegraph Company for the thousands ot
dollars alleged to be due the city as taxes
on nickel-in-the-slot telephone boxes has
aroused inquiry. Ex-Supervisor William
N. McCarthy has particularly interested
himself in the matter. According to him.
City Attorney Franklin K. Lane has
Btated that the suits have been held in
abeyance at the request of Mayor
Schmitz, because the Mayor was trying to
arrange a compromise wuh the telephone
company, the basis of this compromise to
be that the corporation give the munici
pality a free service in case the suits
were abandoned.

THE NEW TORPEDO-BOAT, DE
STROYER WHICH HAS PASS
ED A FINAL. TRIAL.
Good, luck attended the launching of
the handsome steel tug Sea Rover last
night. at the Fulton Engineering and
Shipbuilding Yards. Harbor View.
Punctually at 11 o'clock little Hazel
Hanell, daughter of Harry Hanell, chief
engineer of the works, ascended the plat
form and with the breaking of a bottle
of champagne over the/ bows she spoKe
the words. "I christen thee Sea Rover."
The vessel gracefully glided , through an
avenue of electric lights and several hun
dred cheering people into the waters of
the bay. Â¦ . ,
Whistles of steamships sounded their
shrieking congratulations, and voices of
the witnesses of the interesting ceremony
sent up ringing cheers, and the flag of
the United States fluttered proudly at the
.Dow and stern
TRIUMPH FOR BUILDERS.
It was a triumph for the shipbuilders.'
the designer and the owners, the Ship
owners' and Merchants' Tugboat Com
pany,"and also an evidence of the triumph
of the shipbuilding industry of San Fran
cisco. '.
A- prettier or "more unusual sight could
not be imagined than the launching o'
the "Sea Rover" as she glided away from
the illumination of the scores tÂ»f powerful :
electric lights; Into the dark of the night.
The tug awaiting to take her in tow j
looked like a spectre as she came stealing
quietly alongside of her, and the people
who dotted the shore waving their white
handkerchiefs and hats in the air seemed
like so many 'phantoms.
The launching had , been wisely post
poned by James Spiers, Jr., the general,
manager, from the previous night that
the tide might possibly, assure more safety
for "the operation.
His judgment proved to be good, for the
tide last night: was all that could be de
sired and consequently there were hearty
congratulations exchanged between all
concerned.

The Perry will be the fastest destroyer
in the navy. She did better than thirty
knots on her last trial, but the ferry-boat
captains that saw her shoot down the bay
yesterday are all ready to swear that she
was traveling at more than sixty miles
an hour.
Henry T. Scott said yesterday that he
had received no details of the destroyer's
performances, but had been informed that
she had given satisfaction in every par
ticular and had been accepted by the
Government.
The Perry as first turned out was a
failure. Her model proved unsatisfactory.
She was speedy, but when she traveled
fast she dragged too much of the bay
after her. Her stern was remodeled and
now Ehe reels off thirty knots without
disturbing the surrounding water to any
appreciable extent.
Captain Fenton of the Farragut has had
charge of the recent trials, and Captain
George Harvey has acted as pilot. The
Perry will be sent to Mare Island and be
placed in commission just as soon as the
formal transfer has been made.
tract requirements and will be
turned over to the Government in a few
days. The last trial was made yesterday,
when she gave a continuous performance
which satisfied the naval board in charge
that the Union Iron Works had delivered
the goods and that the Perry was worthy
of adoption by Uncle Sam.
AFTER trials sufficiently rigid and
frequent to amount to tribula
tions the torpedo-boat destroyer
Perry has fulfilled all her con-
There Is absolutely no difficulty with the
brotherhood, and when the few who are stir
ring up this contention cease their reprehensi
ble conduct the matter will be settled and
Tade out of existence. This is the sentiment
>f thirty-seven out of thirty-nine unions of the
ouilding trades, and when the disgruntled two
art- refused support by the outside mischief
aiakers the matter will be at an end.
Seventh, that since the controversy began
:he membership of 4s:{ has dwindled down from
WO members <clalmed) to 1R+ <as shown by the
rote on May 5. J0C2). and since the last named
late others have withdrawn, leaving little or
no opposition to the Hulldlng Trades Council.
Taking these facts into consideration, the
Building Trades Council proposes to continue in
the same manner that it has thus far success
fully managed the mechanical end of the build
ing business in this city, and does not propose
to have outside influences magnify an insig
nificant controversy in which 150 disgruntled
fermonm ere endeavoring- to create strife and
trouble in the building business. The con
iractors understand the situation and are sat
.fified; the journeymen are satisfied and are
working.
Sixth, that the Master Builders of San Fran
cisco, having investigated the question, have
heard both sides and have decided, unani
mously, to sustain the Building Trades Coun
cil.
Fifth, that every member of every carpen
ter's union has three timiÂ»s voted upon the
fubject, first as above stated, second by a vote
nf seven to one in favor of the Building: Traded
Council, and third, by a vote of 381 to 18 sus
la'ninir the Building Trades Council.
Fourth, that every member of every union
affiliated with the Building Trades Council
that voted on the constitution and by a vote
of five in favor to one against, has sustained
the position of the Building Trades Council.
Third, that paid action Is prosecuted by H.
W. Hutton. appointed by llayor Schmitz as
Police Commissioner, and counsel for the
unions affiliated with the San Francisco Labor
Council and the Musicians' Mutual Protective
Association, of which Mayor Schmitz is presi
dent. Is a member.
Second, thai Union 4S3 has taken the mai
ls.- into court and has sought by injunction to
goiern the affairs ot organized labor.
First, that the Building Trades Council is
fu!ly capable of taking tare of its own busi
ness.
The public prints of to-day contained state
ments to the effect that Mayor Schmitz pro
poses to adjust the difficulty now existing be
iv.epii this Council and 483.
Wo strenuously resent this action or pro
pcfi-d action ujwn the following grounds:
The Mayor's efforts to adjust the dif
ferences of the warring factions may not
result in much, however. In view of the
following statement, which was issued
last evening by the Building Trades
Council:
KESENTS MAYOR'S ACTION.
Mayor Schmitz evidently fears that the
council may be brought into the contro
versy and he has accordingly asked to
see the officials of the council with a
view to arriving at a settlement of the
matter. An early consultation will be
held, and ail those who are interested in
the building trades are looking forward
to the future with anxiety. Meanwhile
tlie participants in the struggle are rest
ing on their oars, waiting to see what
will turn up.
It was currently reported last night that
Ihe Labor Council would take a hand in
the settlement of the trouble, inasmuch
as Carpenters' Union No. 4S3 is affiliated
with the council. It is claimed that if the
Building Trades Council becomes too ob
ttinate the Labor Council will simply
call out the stevedores and teamsters who
handle building materials. Shouid thia
action to taken the effect upon the build
ing industry at this time would be most
eerious. That the carpenters of Union
No. 483. which Is affiliated with the coun
cil, have the sympathy of the members
of the council goes without saying.
The business agents of the carpenters'
unions still affiliated with the Building
Trades Council called oft four men from
buildings yesterday because they Â¦were
working with members of Union No. 4S3.
which the council has tabooed. The men
were taken to other jobs and promptly
put to work. While the master builders
nave given their support to the Building
Trades Council, they have done nothing
thus far to precipitate an open rupturo
between the warring factions. The build
ing industry is exceedingly active at the
present time and carpenters are In good
demand. It follows therefore that when
a. carpenter who has a card from Union
No. 22 is called off from one job where
members of Union No. 4S3 are employed
he is taken at once to another job, where
he remains until his presence is discov
ered by the business agent, when the pro
cedure Is re-enacted. In this way the
building operations are not seriously af
fected, and it is now believed that the
trouble Is gradually dying: av.ay.
BUSINESS AGENTS ACTIVE.
The members of the brotherhood who
ere standing out against the Building
Trades* Council because of Its support ot
t'nion No. 22, which was suspended froiii
the brotherhood because of a violation of
the ruies of the brottifcrhood, are receiv
ing hearty support from loyal unions in
all parts of the State. At a meeting of
ibe new district council of the brotner
hood last night a series of resolutions
adopted by the union of carpenters at Point
Kichmond were received. The resolutions
indorsed the stand taken by the brother
hood locals and asserted that no member
of the Point Richmond Union would work,
with or recognize any member of Mc-
Carthy's Union No. Â£2. The members of
that union were designated as "scabs"
and all members of the brotherhood were
cautioned against working with any men
who were not affiliated with the brother
hood.
w
The troubles existing between the
Building Trades Council and the unions
of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters
and Joiners have not yet been settled. The
mediation of Mayor Schmitz has been In
vited and that official consulted witL sev
eral parties to the dispute yesterday. No
p!;in for the settlement of the controversy
was advanced, and it is hardly expected
that the matter will be adjusted within
the month. ';" . > /

NEW YORK, May 8. â Stocks recovered from
yesterday's weakness to-day, although there
was uncertainty manifest in the prevailing
eentiment. A more cheerful feeling over the
anthracite outlook is responsible for consider
able rebuying by short sellers of yesterday,
who professed confidence Â¦ last night that a
strike could not be averted. The hesitation
which developed In the market was due to a
considerable extent to the action taken by the
mine workers' convention, which presents an
entirely new phase of the situation. The ac
tive coaler* reflected no misgiving after the
announcement of the miners' officers to arbi
trate, but they fell into comparative dullness.
The high-priced coalers offered the anomaly
of early weakness, while the Readings were
advancing and a Btrong recovery after the de
mand for Readings had largely died out. The
whele market fell into dullness in the latter
part of the day while waiting for the announce
ment of the reply of the anthracite operators
to the offer of the miners. The result Is that
the day's transactions are not much over half
those of yesterday. Outside the Readings the
principal activity was in St. Paul, Union Pa
cific, the local tractions and Southern Railway,
t'nlon Pacific and SL Paul were bought neav-
Jly for Western account, the attraction being
attributed to crop conditions. The referee'*
decision upholding the constitutionality of the
New York franchise tax law Induced some ac
tive liquidation of the Ftocks of New Yorlc
public utilities', but they were well supported
and rallied. The advance in Louisville and
Scuthern Railway met realizing. Reports of
an apparent contest between the two Interests
lor control of coal lands increased the dispo
sition to cell, Illinois Central becoming strong
:n contrast to its weakness yesterday, while
the other two stocks were advancing. There
were evidences of etrength among minor stocks
which are supposed to be the subject of manip
ulation by speculative pools, although various
rumors contiued to circulate of their pros
pective absorption or merging. Tennessee Coal
end Colorado Fuel were under pressure. The
laÂ»t named, however, recovered to well above
i&Et night. International Power fell 9 points
lÂ»-low the laet Bale price, but fully recovered.
There was a tale of St. Lawrence and Adiron
dack at 52. compare! with the preceding, sale
et 138%. This sale was Iwfore the collapse of

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 8.â Bears who had been
hammering wheat prices on favorable weather
ccnoitions found too many bull factors arrayed
against them to-day. The weather was good
over nearly all the wheat belt and statistical
Journals issued bearishly favorable crop news,
but receipts were very small and the cash po
sition was very strong. Cables also were com
paratively firm, when depression : was taken
into account. After an early see-saw in prices
bulls took hold of the market and worked ad
vances. The cash situation has gradually de
veloped a strength that the traders eay prob
ably will Influence speculation for some time
Elevators have all the wheat in sight the
country is offering little and the elevator peo
ple have sold much of their holdings at July
prices rather than at the lower May prices
The result has been a scarcity of cash wheat
at the recently current May figure. To-day
May prices on outside markets advanced above
July and at one time here almost equaled them
Added to this was a good com strength. Good
cash sales were made late yesterday, fourteen
loads being taken for export. ' Shorts cov
ered freely and July, which opened U@Â« c to
V*@%c up at 74%c to 74%c, sold up to 74 %c
and closed firm, %@%c up. at 74%c. '**':
Corn ruled strongest of the grains to-day and
made .good advances. Traders generaly regard
the position of the bull party as such that any
opening by It the crowd quickly follows. July
closed firm, %Â«$%c up, at 61Vi@61%c. Â¦
Oats showed strength and activity. July
closed firm, %c up, at 30%c. y
Provisions were Influenced for good advances
by Â£ J? 01 !! 1111 " 1 } 1011 , of demand that has
marked the pit for several ' days. The has
market was strong and packers gave the nit
support. Pork closed 30c higher, lard l'2%c

Receipts were diminishing,- and' there was a
good cash business, but the market was heavy
and ir. need of better public support for a per
manent advance. The strength was largely
sympathetic with the firmness in corn and
oats. There were large withdrawals of wheat
and corn from public elevators and the crowd
was bearish and short. A prominent South

at from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 .bushels.'

SALMONâ This market is quiet, but the
Eastern markets are in good shape, and salmon
Is going into consumption more widely than
ever before. Fairly heavy consignments have
been made from New York to England. The
run on the Columbia River is fair for this pe
riod, and a large run is looked for later. The
Pacific Selling Company. has announced prices
at $1 50 for tails and $1 65 for flats. At these
rates, however, no business has as yet been
reported, except that which was done some
time ago, subject to opening prices. New York
jobbers "look upon these rates as too high. On

visible showing a further increase during April
of 135,000 bags. In this connection the mild
crops, now coming to market, must be counted
as factors, and for some weeks to come, but
indications are that receipts from those quar

TACOMA, Wash:; May 8.â It is reported
from Skagway that large salmon com
panies are rapidly securing possession of
all the cannery sites on the Alaska
coast. The wonderful success which has
attendefl " the combinations of Puget
Sound and other canning interests have
resulted in causing something of a stam
pede to obtain available locations near
the mouth of Alaskan streams.
The Alaska Fisheries Union has ob
tained .of a large site near
Haines> at the mouth of Chilkat Inlet.
The company is preparing to build there
a cannery 80x440 feet in size and several
other Â¦ two-story buHdings.-' Eighty thou
sand dollars will be invented in the plant
before it starts. Surveyor Diers of
Skagway has just surveyed and staked
fourteen other cannery sites located at
favorable points between the head of
Lynn Canal and Wrangel for the same
concern. The eosajiany is comoosed of
Puget Sound capitalists, who aspire to
take a prominent place in the salmon
canning business. If the original can
nery at Haines proves successful some of
the other . sites will be speedily built
upon. King salmon are already running

of Private Edward C. Richter, Company
I, Twenty-eighth which oc
curred at Das Â¦ Marinas, Â¦ Philippine Isl
ands/ February - 9 Â¦ last. Richter ,was
boisterous and violent and intoxicated,
calling Lieutenant Sinclair. vile names. As
he resisted arrest and attempted to kick
the. sergeant, he was tied, and as his pro
fane language continued, cold water was
dashed into his face for a period of about
three minutes. As he continued abusive
Richter was gagged, a .cloth being held
over his head, which was removed from
time to time, to allo.w. the prisoner - to
vomit. Five minutea' afterward he-was
in his cell. .He was breathing when he
was laid on the cot. About two pailfuls
of cold water were thrown upon him. An
hour afterward Lieutenant 'Sinclair, be
ing called' by the sergeant of the guard,
went for the surgeon, -but when he. re
turned â¢ fifteen minutes "after the prisoner
was dead. A post mortem examination
showed the lungs were very- much con
gested, with indications -of . tubercular
foci, and so < much involyed as to cause
surprise that Richter had been received
on enlistment. The surgeon said his
death was caused by the accidental en
trance, of vomit in the trachea and bron
chial tubes, causing- choking. â¢ The pro
ceedings of the court-martiar that tried
Lieutenant Sinclair have not yet been re

a policeman, who took him to the County
Hospital. The old' man could' give no ac
count of himself and it â¢ was several
weeks before he recovered sufficiently to
give/ his name. . His recovery was slow,
and the once rotund Waterson is now a

a certain physician .who filed a claim for
$250 against Waterson's estate for medi
cal services rendered prior to his death.
Waterson, who lives at 346 Fourth street,
says he never, saw' the doctor in ques

the fact that he lies at rest under trans

him to lay by the tidy sum of $700 in the

jolly old fellow, with a cheery greeting

Temple last night by Noble Grand Arch
Julius S. Godeau, assisted by Grand Sec
retary James F. Martinonl, Grand.Treas
urer, Past Supreme Arch I* G. Schord
and Past Arches Bamman and Stock. The
new grove, which has taken the name of
Old Friends, starts with sixty-two char-
Ter members. The ceremony of institu
tion was conducted in an Impressive man
ner, and the ! following named were In
stalled as the officers for the current
term:
. The police have In their i possession a
tintype of Hadley . dressed as a minister
which was taken at the Cliff House about
five years ago. ; None of Hadley's inti
mate friends ever knew him to essay the
role of a minister. -This is taken to indi
cate that Hadley was a man of pecu
liarly eccentric habitsâ just such a man
who would go about laying fiendish plans
for a. young girl's death in the stealthy
manner that the mysterious C. B. Haw
kins consummated his foul plot. .
Â¦Â¦"Â¦* "When ,the- time comes we hope -to pro
duce enough evidence to send Hadley to
the gallows," said Chief Wittman when
seen last night. "We are working away
on the case, getting a little information
every day. Captain Seymour has his best
detectives detailed on the case, and all
we want at this time Is the arrest of
Hadley. I feel confident that we will
have him in the toils before long. We
will follow him to the end of the earth,
if necessary, to bring him back to face
the charge of murder which the mother
of the dead girl has lodged against him."
DRESSED AS MINISTER.
Captain Seymour claims to have'dis
covered another ' strong: bit of evidence
which is damaging to Hadley. Captain
Seymour and his detectives- are conduct
ing the investigation quietly, and for rea
sons best known to themselves they In
tend to keep their discoveries secret foi
the time being.
Chief Wittman is in hopes that he will
receive a clew to Hadley's whereabouts
within the next few days. The fugitive
is well known throughout the big cities,
and it is quite likely that he will be rec
ognized through one of the photograpaic
circulars calling for his arrest which are
well distributed all over the country.
Both Captain Seymour and Chief WittÂ«
man have little faith in the theory that
Hadley has committed suicide. They are
convinced that he is in Hiding either in
Mexico or In some other neighboring for
eign territory. .
Much comment is made on the fact
that the two furniture men- who had
dealings with the mysterious Hawkins
and the grocery clerk, who saw him
with the fuller girl, identify the .photo
graph of Hadley so readily, while Krone,
the restaurant man. says he is not the
John Bennett who â¢ is supposed "to have
met Nora Fuller at the Popular Res
taurant the- day she disappeared. Krone
claimed to have known Hadley well, but
upon being questioned - closely â¢ he ad
mitted that he had not seen him- for
three years. This state of affairs, coupled
with the fact, that Krone said at the out
set-of the case that his patron, whom
he knew as John Bennett, sometimes
wore a clerical garb, and the police hav
ing established beyond a shadow of a
doubt that Hadley sometimes clad him
self. In ministerial garb, has given rise to
strange conjectures as to Krone's posi
tion.
Seldom in the history of crime ha3 a
police department penetrated into such a
deep mystery as that which surrounded
the Identity of the fiend who strangled
the unfortunate girl, and if Hadley is
caught and convicted of. the murder
much credit is due Chief of Police Witt
man and Chief of Detectives Seymour.
"When Hadley's .name was first' men
tioned In connection with the murder
there were many who scoffed 4 at the ef-"
forts of the police to fix the responsi
bility of the brutal crime upon the miss
ing Examiner man, but now that the po~
lice have developed a chain of strong?
evidence connecting him with u.e mur
der there is a disposition on the part of
those who .ridiculed the idea to fall in
line and accept the belief that Hadley is
the murderer, i
