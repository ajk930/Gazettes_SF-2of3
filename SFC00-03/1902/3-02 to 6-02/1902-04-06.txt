A remarkable natural cave has been
discovered in Montana, about fifty miles
east of Butte. A large river with a cat
aract of about 100 feet was explored for
a distance of several miles without dis
covering its source or outlet. A few ar
ticles, of stone and copper utensils and
some human bones were also discovered
in one of the large apartments explored
There were other evidences that at some
time in a prehistoric period the cave
used as a habitation. The present eâ¢
trance to the cave was made by soma
Ume quarryrten at a point 1500 feet above
the bed of the Jefferson River while en
gaged in blasting rock. The formation
of stalactite and other natural decbra?
tions throughout the cave are pronounced
the most beautiful and varied ever keen.
IS the hair going up or is It coming
. down? that is the query.
Mirs Muriel Wilson, the English
beauty, who is the center of every
London drawing-room and who is
said 1o be about to go on the stage, will
ansurfr you that it 5s coming down. Per
haps she will add that it feels so.
At 2. recent fashionable .function Miss
Wilson's hair was twisted extremely low.
It lay, not in the back of her neck, but
far below the 'nape, and was next thing
to down her back.
It was caught by a solitary Jeweled
fiagcer for all the world like a tragedy
queer.'e txessal ornament It is said that
this style of headgear will do more to pro
voke a woman to nervous prostration
than any other one known kind of irri
tant. The fear that it wjll come down
haunts one continually.
And it is to be a haunting 1 season. Hap-
Einlns icto the establishment of a large
hair-dresser the o^ther day I saw some
coiffures Hung â that is the only word,
hung. They were what Is known as .model
coiffures, and were to be photographed
"for the trade." This means to the lay
man that they were to show the .'styles
that are to prevail, and, consequently,
were of intense lnterest.
Ihe Classic Head.
One of these, not at all practical,
showed the classic bead dress. The hair
was tv.ined with tinseled bands, which
v.ere arranged in ornaments upon the
cars. The object was to ehow women
how very becoming the simple, low styles
could be made and how well a beautifully
Fhaped head would show off, if it were
allowed to display its natural contour,
instead of being decorated with humps
and bumps, braids and puffs, curls and
* other fixingB of the hairdresser's art.
The low styles of hair dressing, really,
though, as a matter of fact, call for
more real art than ih*> high on**. It Is
comparatively eaÂ«y to dress the hair high,'
v.-hilo the low style seeds the aid Â«f pins
A woman of much fashionable preten
sions is wearing a tan-colored gown. Her
hair is Jet black, but in its coils there
are amber hair pins to match her tan
colored gown. Another l woman, i also of
fashion, wears black pins In her blonde
hair, large, conspicuous pins of black jet
to match her black gown.
Â¦ liut there ' are prettier methods of
clipped off. '''; So. much for the rose that is
from nature's own hand. . ,'
; -; The Slower Spot - - . '
The rose made by man is the one that
Is worn and the one that has beauty to
recormr.end it. - It. Is . a great, beautiful
thing of luster and softness, of rlelicacy
and of ''scent also", for it is artificially
really tied just : where the old- fashioned
bang used to end, at the half head. ;
The hair 1b, .now \ twisted- round.aud
round, In full hand fashion, as every wo
man knows how to twist Mt. and is knot
ted in a tall. pagoda. While it still points
high the sides are .pinned fast and the top
is left towering. This is the extremely
high head dressing.... : >" ,.:,. , Â¦ 'Â¦
worn medium. Upon the crown of the
head, like a back country. woman, as they
say in London, the effect is very I middle
aged. Â¦
This coiffure, which is the one practiced
by many of the leading Hair dressers, is
built by combing the hair so high up,, and
so far forward, that one feels â¢ as | though
one were tying It upon the brows. , It Is
and care, knowledge and all the rest, to
make it look well.
A handsome modification of L'Aiglon is
shown in a low coifture which is made by
waving the whole hetid. The hair is part
ed upon one side and is done in the
French wave, which is a wave that seems
to turn both ways, like the natural wave
of a euny head. : Â¦
It takes, a professional to accomplish
the French wave, for, though deep, it has
a rounuish, natural twist wnich cannot be
imitated by an amateur. . .
-fie hair, after being thoroughly waved,
is all drawn to the nape of the neck and
twisted into a big soft knot, which is aft
erward lifted a little and spiked to the
middle of the back of the head. The re
sult is an old-fashioned Xhough very be
coming drooping knot, careless and grace
ful.
Ears r ave certainly gone out of style.
It is claimed that they :rcv.er were very
much in vogue with artists and that no
â¢picture was ever painted of a famous
beauty, showing her ears. Only the lobes
are visible and not always those.
Dressing the Bars.
It is hard upon people whose faces are
broadest across the center, this vogue for
covering the ears, buj. for these there is
the pretty recourse of curling the locks in
iittie wisps just at the upper lobe of tho
ears so that the tiny curls may fall and
cover them. So with the short hair- back
of the ears. Curl it tightly, comb out the
curls loosely, and let them tv/ine if they
will. . ' '
The trouble with hair that is not nat
urally curly is that it will not twine. Left
to themselves, the curls come out straight
and the artistic sense of hair dressing is
shocked. The smallest curls come on
hair pins for the purpose of sticking into
the hair, and the wise woman will avail
herself of these and own -from two to
twenty for constant and daily use, mak
ing sure always that they are secured
with crinkly pins, warranted to stick for
ever. * *
Mrs. Clarence Mackay does her hair
charmingly. It is allowed to fall straight
tack from her face, leaving the forehead
and temples smooth. This may seem a
bit trying, but really it is not so. Try It
once. Wave ycur hair, each hair, for,
every inch, draw it back very loosely,
using a small pompadour "rat" under tho
front and' on each side.
At the back of the head, very low, tie
the hair and then twist it into an 8, the
lower lobe of which shall caress the
shoulders. Use very long pins, the color
of your hair, to secure it in place, and
finally stick in the fancy pins. This is the
true French coiffure up to date and the
French wave.
The High Head Coiffure.?
There Is a high coiffure that is very be
coming, and it may be stated that coif
fures are either very high or very low.
This is the very high one and It does not
belle its name, for it seems toppling for
ward. It is called the Princess Chimay
coiffure, but it . Is worn by high society
women, conspicuous among whom are
Miss Morton, daughter of Levi P. Mor
ton; Miss Gerry, daughter of Commodore
Gerry; Miss Burden, a New York belle
and Mrs. Payne Whitney of Washington
It Is a youthful coiffure, for It Is tossed
eo far front that it does not give the face
that mature expression of hair that Is
can one call these bands that take the
place of sleeves for evening wear?â
were of blue satin, doubled and lined and
stiffened. Covering the band there was
a filigree work of gold, with small dia
monds set in, or perhaps they were tiny
rhinestonesâ you cannot tell these days,
for one quite equals the other.
A complete shoulder trimming of fili
gree was worn by Mrs. Cornwallis "West,
the younger, a few evenings ago. This
American woman, who has for so long
been conspicuous in the Queen's set, is
now out in a renewal of her beauty and
youth. She is very handsomely dressed
and wears blue a great deal. Blue was
her wedding color, blue and white, with
red roses.
Mrs. West a Gibson Girl.
Her gown at a fashionable evening re
ception was a low cut one in blue moire.
The waist .was very . Gibsonese. It was
low cut. with the. plaits arranged to turn
back each* way toward the shoulders. Not
a particle of trimming marred the plain
ness of the waist.
The shoulder trimmings were different.
Upon one white shoulder there stood a
small bunch of white feathers. Over the
other shoulder there was a gold filigree
work that was shaped to fit the arm. It
was very open and looked almost supple.
It lay. flat upon the shoulder and rather
hugged it. like a bracelet upon the arm.
The, under part was of ribbon, only the
upper part being of the metal.
The eccentric French sleeve is almost
universally v.orn with evening gowns. The
two sleeves are differently trimmed, thus
making the eccentricity. The manner in
which they can be made to differ is inter
esting, but in arranging: them oddly the
utmost care should be taken to make
them match to a certain extent. The cus
tom of wearing a shoulder strap of a con
trasting color, or one that is entirely at
variance with the ' gown in shape, ma
terial, desisn or other ways, is not a
pretty one. There should be more uni
formity.
The Josephine sleeve is neat and simple.
"it is the puff of satin w:th both shoulders
Similarly treated, to which- fa?b on adds
che later day custom of decc.-.r;ng one
v.ith small ostrich feathers.
An evening sleeve to be recommended
for its becornlngness to the arm is the one
that is all /of lace. This is delightful,
Â¦whether it be in the form of a lace strap,
â¢which is thrown over the upper part of
the shoulder, or in the long lace sleeve,
that Is wrinkled from shoulder to thumb.
This lace sleeve is made of -open lace
not very fine, and it Is shirred outside and
In3ide, to make a thick, soft shirring
There is no lining, though there Is.an up
to-date fad for chiffon underneath.
matching the pins to the gown. Lovely
ornaments in turquoise wide pins for
pushing into the coiffure can be obtained
and side combs that are finished In tur
quoise and in pearls, in garnets and in
emeralds. Â¦'" .' â¢
One can really get combs finished In any
manner, set alons the top with stones of
any hue. It is the best of taste to match
the gown in this manner â paying It this
mark of respect.
It is a thing not believable, until one has
taken the time to observe it closely, but
the gown really takes on an added ele
gance if there is an effort made to match
It with combs and the littles of dress. Try
the effect of wearing turquoise and gold
Jewelry with your blue gown. Then put
on ornaments that do not match It in any
way and bear no relation fo It and ob
serve the wide difference. â¢
There are bodices built especially for
the low neck and low coiffure and others
that are designed for the high. The bod
ice that is to be worn with the low hang
ing coiffure Is generally very plain around
the neck and closely finished, without
feathers or frills.
The fact that the hair Is to hang low
is sufficient to dress the neck and shoul
ders without the need of elaborate sleeve
ornaments.
Mrs. Harrison's Gown.
A lovely gown for Mrs. Burton Harri
son, to be worn with a low coiffure, had a
very simple arrangement of chiffon over
the shoulders. A strap of chiffon was
trimmed with pearl ornaments and the
same strap was brought around the neck
and fastened at the front, the pearl or
naments trimming it all the way. At the
back It was tied In a bow of chiffon and
pearls. Nothing could have been plainer
or more becoming.
In many cases the bodice that is to be
worn with a low coiffure, the evening or
dinner bodice, has no sleeves at ail, but
merely a strap of Jeweled velvet, or on*
of ribbon with tiny mock Jewel ornaments
applied.
A new trimming for the strap sleÂ«vÂ»
consists of a feather trimming. The very
tip ends of feathers, none longer than half
an Inch, are sewed upon the shoulder
strap, which Is fastened to keep its shape.
The whole is not more than two Inches
wide, and the feathers, instead of being:
aggressive, are persuaded to lie down per
fectly snug and flat.
Ribbon- that can be shirred along each
edge by a string woven In It Is tuwd tor
the shoulder strap. The string Is polled
up to make a puff of from one to thre*
Inches In width. This forms the sleeve.
Still another full dress sleeve, and one
that bears the stamp of novelty. Is made
of little loops of ribbon, one overlapping
the other and the whole covering the
strap, which roust be very narrow. The
loops are made of two-faced ribbon, so
arranged that the inner side shows slight
ly, Just a tint being visible.
Bodice for High Coiffure.
The bodice that Is designed for the high
colff are Is entirely different In every -way.
Here Is the chance for an elaborate struc
ture, the more elaborate the better.
At a Washington function, and It must
be admitted that Washington Is for thÂ»
first time In recent history the center of
social gayety, a beautiful belle wore upon
one shoulder a garden bouquet. Gerani
ums, roses, panales and small hollyhocks
were all there In one mass. The other
shoulder -was dressed with a very large
puff of satin.
Another young woman wore a bunch of
Prince of Wales plumes upon one
shoulder, while the other had straps of
black velvet.
The Jeweled strap Is constructed In new
fashion There Is one jeweled shoulder
decoration that consists of three straps,
each one stiffened with a little framework
of steel. In the. steel were set turquoise.
A set of shoulder straDSâ for what else
Â¦ The very front of the hair, .which was
previously parted off, Is now waved and
brought down so that It is draped across
the v forehead. The brows are covered by
it and the ' eyebrows, even, are partially
concealed. ... Finally, the head is finished
with pins or other decorations. â¢"Â¦ â¢-
The Mrs. Patrick Campbell coiffure is
very popular. For this dress the hair
very high and wind It with ribbons. Take
a strip of ribbon three yards long and be
gin at the back. Wind it three, times
around the head with the strands
coming an inch apart. . Finally tie in a
.bow. "knot right at the back. If properly
done, there will he one rope of the rib
bon, around the knot or coiffure, one just
below the. knot, while the third will band
the forehead." â¢ . ' . '
. .. Roses. and Bibbons.
. White ribbon, with satin finish la pret
tiest.'for the head decoration, but pala
blue 'and pastel pink are preferred by
many as looking less bride-like. Butter
cup yellow is very good upon dark hair,
the object being in every case to secure
a contrast.
\ But J of. all the hair decorations ' there is
nothing that equals in popularity the
flower, and particularly the rose.
The rose, exaggerated size, is In favor
this season, and it appears in all places,
in the way and out of the way, in season
and out of season.
.The exaggerated roses are those that
are either a great deal too : large or a
great deal too small. -For the berthas
and the flounces the tiny button rose is
the best. \ But for the hair the very large
rose is the one that Is worn.
. The{ Spanish coiffure shows the hair
dressed .low. ;with the rose located Just
below, the ear." It. is always a bright red
rose," and it; is ".fastened deeply in the
hair/jso that the hair fairly waves and
curls over it.
Â¦The rose, as worn for hairdressing pur
poses; "is not -always the natural rose, and
she who is wary will select the rose of
panne or of silk, or even of cniffon, or
of satin ribbon, fo'r it is much better
fromtmany standpoints.
Â¦ The natural rose has its faults and
failings. It withers readily. That goes
without emphasis. It is rarely of a suffi
cient'brilliancy, unless a very high-priced
rose, to be effective. It has a tendency to
open and fall that is most provoking, and
It is afflicted with thorns that must be
scented. This rose is made
D_f satin ribbons so cunningly
that you can scarcely detect
the fraud, and it 13 made of
velvet with a chiffon center,
the leaves delicately curled.
There is a - new rose ma
terial, tulle', doubled and
stiffened. This is made into
small roses tied together
and surrounded by leaves for
the hair. **;ys
â¢ > â¢ . . . Just where the rose will
_. â ,".â¢ be located is a question.
Shall it : go , back of the ear or on
>?p of the head? Fashion says that
it shall be at either place, but. if low.
it must be very low, and if high. It must
be very high. There la.no Intermediary
point.
A rose worn by Miss Roosevelt was
perched 00 high that it looked like a tiny
crown. : In Lady Curzon's latest pictures
the .rose is worn in very lofty fashion.
. There is a new way of wearing the
artificial flower, which is neither high nor
low, but which is very becoming. It la
low and Just over the ear instead of
under It. The flower must droop so as
to cover the ear and set it off, ornament-
Ing it prettily, and making one side of
the head decidedly picturesque. This is
the Miss Leiter style, having been brought
into prominence by the beautiful M'ss
Daisy at a dinner dance given for Miss
Roosevelt.
The flower should be light in tone and
floppy in kind; the prettiest flower for
this use is a. pink poppy or one in a bril
liant red, in, chiffon or crepe de chine.
The Queen's Coiffure.
Â¦ The Queen Alexandra coiffure is only a
week old. It was inaugurated at Sand
rlngham at . a family dinner when her
Majesty entertained certain of her Bis
ters-in-law. for she has grown wonder
fully fdrmal, and finds that they must
announce -their coming to the Queen, of
England, whereas they once had the fam
ily privilege of dropping in at any tlra*
upon the Princess of Wales.
Â¦At this dinner her Majesty wore her hair
with j two curls hanging down her neck.
The fashion of the dangling curls is a
growing one and is much in demand at
the colffurlsts because so highly recom
mended by the hairdresser. It assists a
thin neck also and hides defects of throat
and contour. It adds grace, too, and Is
altogether admirable.
Years ago th* Queen worÂ» her curls,
but discarded them when they were no
longer the world's way; now she has ta
ken to them again, but they hang both
on one side close together. In the curls,
at the side of the neck, under the ear,
there was placed a very large white rose.
Roses decked her gown in a corsage
bouquet and there were roses at her belt.
In these days of matching the gown
one would think that every possibility had
been exhausted. That the parasol must
match is a foregone conclusion with any
one who has studied fashions for the past
few years. And that the handkerchief,
the belt, the stock and all the littles must
match is also certain.
But now it is the coiffure that must
coincide, arid many are the ways and
devices by which it la done.

that his bones may He among those of his

him from his country should follow him
into a foreign land and deprive him of the
sympathy of his fellow countrymen is
still more cruel. Len Pow dare not tako

banishment is as complete as though he

And when Len Pow takes off his broad

of his degradation. Len Pow's queue is
gone. Â» '
For a year this lonely outcast has mads
his home in the cleft of rock whose only
outlook is a stretch of, sand with a
stretch of sea beyond.
The only . path to the cave ' from the
world above is down the sheer, chalky
cliff that rises abruptly from the watsr.
Xo recluse could find a more secluded
spot
At high tide the waves creep to the very
entrance of the cave; but far back and
safe from the fiercest" storm is a ledge
that serves as a bunk, and with wreck
age washed ashore by the sea the hermit
has carefully partitioned off his sleeping
room. Rude comfort it affords, this bed
of rock, with a single, worn counterpane
for covering, but with the stoic courage
of his race Len Pow accepts his fate
without complaint.
At low tide he is less cranaped for room,
and outside ,on the sand he builds his
little fire and cooks his meals. Only a
bit, of fish, a meager portion of rice and,
by way; of luxury now and then, a cup
of tea, for one. whose appetite was once
tempted by bird's nest soup and bamboo
buds and lily pods and' the what-nots of !
delight to the Chinese epicure.

family of .Len Pow..
He was born in /Peking and up to hts
twentieth year was under the protection â¢
of a stern, yet kind, man, who was uncle,
guardian and friend In one. His educa
tion was rigidly â¢ attended to by this
uncle, who had him instructed In moral*
philosophy, * literature and the otheir'
branches cf learning which would fit him
Tor the exalted place he was to occupy.
This man. too, was high In the Grand
Council of . the Empire.
" Len Pow then spent some, years In
Hongkong, where he had. opportunity to
study foreigners, their usages and their
mode of government, and knowledge of
the European and the American and ac
quaintance with them lessened the- preju

All this time he was secure In tha favor

. But here he stops. The face that was
alive with interest In thoughts of the past
ruddenly changes. To press him for rea-' :
eons Is to trespass on forbidden ground.
One fee!s he is intruding'.
All Len Pow' will say is that an edict
was issued and his life was In peril. His
patrimony was taken from him, and with
what little he could gather of his private
means he escaped the hired assassins that j
hounded him and made his way to â¢ this *
country, where he cou'.d at least lire. . .

THE SUISTDAT CALL:

THE HERMIT OF SAND'S ENDqueen of the home kingdom. - She has
most to do with making or breaking the
home life. The husband and father may
measure up to the highest ideals of char
acter, yet if his wife Is not noble and
womanly and in every sense of the word
a helpmeet, the home life will be
marred, its beauty 6carred and its
symmetry destroyed. With the queen of
the home rests largely the happiness of
the home and the safety and training of
â¢ ce hearts that -nestle there. At home
men find either their greatest help or their
greatest hindrance to success In their
calling in life.
Much that has been said about the du
ties of the husband and father in the.
home applies with equal force to the wife
and mother, for many women do as much,
if not more, than their husbands toward
destroying the home. Many women allow
themselves to become bo absorbed in the
social world and in public questions that
they lose all taste for the home life.
In these days we hear so much about
woman's rights and woman's sphere.
Many women have come to look upon the
home kingdom as too small for their high
ambitions: they aspire for what . they
deem higher and nobler honors than those
accruing 1 fro ni building a fine home. Their
dream is for the public platform and pub
lic life, end they ignore the noblest work
In lifeâ the homeâ that they might win
laurels in other fields.
It was Confucius who said, "If the do
mestic duties be well performed there ts
no need to go afar to offer sacrifice."
Â¦Uranting, ~ then, the ". ever- widening
sphere of woman's influence and the pos
sibility of her earning fame for brilliant
achievements outside the home kingdom,
it should never be forgotten that her first
duties undoubtedly begin with the home,'
and if home duties be generally neglected,
all attempts at performing wider duties
in other spheres must end .in failure.
Woman's influence may be as dwarfing
and disintegrating as It is ennobling and
elevating. Â» â¢ : \

This Is certainly a beautiful as well as
powerful illustration of , the best and most
effectual way . for^ women to wield their
influence In; politics' and public - matters.

In the last analysis, borne happiness de
pends on the wife and mother. Wall*
woman's influence reaches far beyond the
home, yet woman at home, as Its queen,
beautifying, sanctifying, adorning and
blessing it, wields a greater influence for
good fh^ri woman In pubic life.
It was Mrs. Beecher who said: **LÂ«t
home stand first before all other things."
"No matter," said she, "how higa your
ambition may transcend Its duties, no
matter how far your talents or your In
fluence may reach beyond its doors, be
fore everything else build up a true home!
Be not its slave; be Its minister! Let It
not be enough that It Is swept and tar
nished, that Its silver is brilliant, that Its
food is delicious, but feed the love In It.
feed the truth in It. feed. thought and as
piration, feed all charity and gentleness
in it. Then from its walls shall com*
forth true woman and the true man. who
shall together rule and bless the land."
This is not an overwrought picture.
. There can be no greater honor than to
'. found such a home and there can be no
higher dignity than to reign Its undli
, puted, honored mistress.
. Mrs. Beecher asks, "What is the ability
to apeak from a public platform to large,
Intelligent audiences, or the wisdom that
commands a seat on the Judge's bench,
; compared to that- which can insure and
preside over a true home, that husband
and children rise and call her blessed?"
Truly, "to be the guiding star, the ruling
.spirit In such a position, is higher honor
"than, to rule an empire."
Â¦ There is no greater need in our country
â¢than a revival of pure home devotion; but
before that is possible there must be a
greater regard for the sanctity of the
marriage tie. This needs to be written
about, preached about and taught to the
rising generation until all shall realize the
sacredness of the wedded relations. Then
the laws of the land must be so con
structed ' and become : so â¢ uniform on this
divine institution, that they will be a fence
about it to guard and protect it against
any unholy invasion. >
About the time when Christianity was
ushered into the world family life was
terribly, decayed through frequency of di
vorce and Increase of licentiousness.
Women, it is said, counted the years, not
by, the number of the consuls, but by the
number of their rejected husbands; they
divorced themselves so often that they
wore out their bridal veils.
â¢ Tertullian, speaking of the women of
s that age, says: . "As for divorce,, they
> long for 'it; they long for it as though it
, were the natural consequences of mar
â¢ riages."
At one time laws had to be passed for
' the restraint of immorality, compelling
people to marry, and at another time
â¢ j laws had . to be passed refraining them
' >Â¦Â¦ from marrying. .'-.â¢ ' - , Â¦
. History; seems to be repeating itself in
â¢ respect to â¢ the matter of divorce. It is
1 indeed, appalling the light manner in
. which many hold the wedded relation and
, the home tie. Hearts are too often givÂ»n
like street merchandise or driven like
[ bought slaves in fair freedom's gui3e.
Love and mind are poisoned with per
.. jury's foul stains and too often the cold
world binds hearts in joyless marriage
! chains. A much-needed exhortation is
; contained in these lines:

#^f CCORDING to one of the Biblical
X^ j writers "Whoso findeth a wife
/ Â¦Â¦{ findeth a good thing, and obtain-
V. I eth favor of the Lord." This
X statement, though coming from a
very wise man, needs to be modified some
what. We are certainly not to understand
that every man who gets a wife gets a
"good thing." If this is the universal rule
then tell me who so many benedicts seek
to be separated from their wives? Is it
because they don't know a "good thing"
â¢when they find it? If the "favor of the
Lord" is the evidence .that a man's wife
is a blessing to him, then it is evident
many men made a bad bargain when they
found a wife, for they seem to have every
thing else but the "favor of the Lord.'
Tbis same Biblical writer makes clear
to us, in another place, that he had in
mind a certain kind of a wife, for he
says, "A prudent wile is from the Lord."
Then follows a description or character
sketch of this "prudent" or ideal wife.
"Who can find a virtuous woman, for
her price is far above rubies. The heart
of her husband doth safely trust in her.
so that he shall have no need of spoiÂ».
She will do him good and not evil all the.
days of her life. Strength and honor are
her clothing. She openeth her mouth with
wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of
kindness. She looketh well to the ways
of her household, and eateth not the bread
of idleness. Her children arise up and
call her blessed; her husband, also, and
he pralseth her. Favor is deceitful, and
beautj- is vain; but of woman that fear
eth the Lord, she shall be praised."
If this is the kind of a woman a. man
finds for his wife we caft readily see why
the wise writer should say he "findeth a
good thing, and obtaineth favor of the
Lord." Here, then. Solomon has painted
for all time a golden picture of the virtu
ous woman in her manifold and fruitful
domestic activities.
While the husband and father has his
fluty and influence in making home all
that it should be, the fact remains that
the wife and mother is accorded the hon-
ored place ar.d position of undisputed

houetted darkness of I tha I streets to the
Emergency Hospital. When we ''ring in"
from there there are orders for two runs.

tha narrow sidewalk * lies c a man's body,
and it seems .lifeless,' It has- no .move-

lifted into his equipage, and when, tha
officer goes to ring in to the office, as is
always done, the answer comes to go and
pick up a man who has fallen and frac
tured his skull at Montgomery and Sac
ramento, streets, and to see what Is the
trouble at Kearny and Bush streets.
The night shadows seem darker j after
Kearny street, as we whirl to the corner
described, â¢ to find that a man had fallen
there, but was taken into a hotel by
friendsâ so an aged man tells us who
is about the corner. The horses get a
sharp cut as they shy at a broken-down
wagon that peers out of the darkness like
an evil monster, and we head for the cor
ner of Pine and Kearny streets. Here a
crowd is assembled around four diminu
tive Japanese, arrested by an officer in
citizen's clothes for disturbing the peace.
Whisky seems to be at the bottom of their
trouble, and their friends of the same race
surge excitedly to the very steps of the
patrol wagon as the offenders climb re?
luctantly in. They huddle together, and
the drunken man with the pipe, looks at
them with a lofty air. By the time we
reach the station several Japs have
arrived. -with no money, but with futile
plans for saving the offenders ' from the
wrath to come. They hover around the
place all night, but the offenders sleep
there. - . '
As I stand in the doorway of the court
I see a procession of walking delegates,
sodden and weary, telling the story of
the other half that lives as It can, march
ed by an officer toward the big doors that
lead upward toâ a night's sleep, or many
of them, in prison. Sound sleep. It is, too.
They are- past regrets, and the stones of
the streets are hard. Turning to speak
to the driver, I hear a grating noise, and
a sudden light flashes in the dim court
yard. It is the door 'of the Morgue open
ing for another horror. Out of the black
wagon a - grisly, grating something- is
slowly taking shape. There is a little knot,
of boys and men watching It. It forces ,
their gaze, as it does mine. Just as the
gravelike shape of the thing is blackly de- .
fined against the white marble floor of
the Morgue one of the horses of the pa
trol gives a plaintive whinny. It is for .
Jack, and I see his face in a circle of
light. He beckons, and I stumble in after
the grewsome thing. The Coroner. is
there, and someone whispers "Suicide!"'
There is a* ghastly sound of turning
screws, and the lid comes off. Set in black
and gold is a dead girl's distorted face...
The gold Is her hair, which falls In great
extra duty on one . of- our runs, bearing
a man with a broken leg. As we go
through Pacific street where the rickety
saloon pianos are still tinkling the fr^a^l
uniforms of > soldiers are numerous. They
are the cause of tha run we find as we
clang the gong in front of a saloon full
of them. The officer of the wagon runs
in. Between the screening doors we can
hear and see that a free-for-all fight is in
progress: There are some negroes, and
just as the officers are bringing out a
soldier with a blood-stained uniform and
a battered head one of them throws a
chair, and a shot rings out. Tha sound
of police whistles! and in the next few
moments there are lively times. Three
more men. are put in the wagon. I am
in there, too? The wounded man Is still
and etark , in the bottom of the wagon.
The lights dance r aa we speed for the
Emergency Hospital. Vice nor Justice
cannot -stop us, for a human life Is at
stake. Tenderly the wounded man is lifted
out and left to the ministrations of those
to whom such is a dally business. There
Is . a message for us from tha office to
stop again on the Â¦ Barbary Coast for
more trouble. But we fly back to the
prison with our three prisoners. The ser
geant meets us. "The man at the-hospi
tal died Just after you left. The mtss&g*
Just came, V he said.
"There ain't so many people arrested
as there used to be. We'd oughter had a.
burglary or a - hold-up to-niht," says
Jack as we dash for the Barbary Coast
again. When we start back we have as
a Â¦ passenger a middle-aged woman clad
In poor calico with a rusty cape and hat
. She is "happy drunk." so Jack says, and
she leers in a maudlin way at the officer
as he hands her in. At the prison I go
upstairs with her into the brightly lighted
room,, with a side view of adjoining cor
ridors, vistas of steel bars, and faces
pressed against them. "Nellie Murray,"
Â¦ says the sergeant before she can tell her
name. Forty-nine years she confesses
to, and born in New Hampshire. "She
is an old-timer; and good for six months
as a vagrant on Monday," 1 the driver tells
me. They all have a. horror of hearing
the words "one vag" shouted to tha Ber
geant - as -Â¦ the officer -brings them in.
. Drunkenness -usually means discharge in
the morning, but vagrancy means time
serving. Though for a wonder we have
not been called to a murder In Chinatown.
.The wagon Is busy for the next hour,
and the prisoners : vary from a smooth
faced young clerk, drunk to sottishness,
to a little gray-bearded old man who says
at the station,' "I wish you to understan"
(hie) shentlemen," that I am not (hie)
â¢drunk at all." Another trip brings in a
middle-aged artist, who [ is swearing
drunk, but who clings to a photo button
picture of a child on his coat when they
take his valuables at the office. There
-is another woman, too, a young one who
kicks and screams in a drunken frenzy
' all the way from the saloon from which
she la taken. Once in the sleepy lull Just
after 1 a. m. another patrol wagon brings
Â¦ - in -Â¦ a. swell-looking . young man : and a
. pretty young girl. â¢ There is a long con
, sultation with the lieutenant, and then an
officer takes Â¦ the girl to ' her - home and
The, doctor and the nurse are waiting,
roused by the gong, and the light and
warmth stream out. The Italian boy who
has come with us runs in, and the man,
v. ho has revived, is helped in. crying that
"his heart hurts him." The doctor ex
amines him. gives him a cordial, says
that he is subject to epileptic fits and
gives him some advice. The man insists
upon shaking hands with everybody,
thanks the doctor and makes for the
streetcar with the Italian boy,, the friend
who has not deserted him.-.'
Jack chirrups to his horses, says It
"looks like there'll be somethln* doln'
to-night," and we roll along among the
men of the wharves into the pleasure
seeking crowds of brilliant Market street,
and swerve into the alley from Merchant
street, with its saloons, that leads to the
courtyard. It is a relief to get into the
big light space, with its resounding stone
floor that spreads out from the sergeant's
desk, that is called, ironically. It would
teem, the "reception or assembly room."
The two patrolmen on office . duty sit
down for a chat, but the patrol wagon's
Saturday night round-up has begun.
Clang! Whang! goes the brass-throat
ed gong, and in a few moments more the
soldiers that are idling along in little
gangs are looking after us as we make
for the dark corners of the Barbary Coast.
This time it is Just a plain drunkâ a mid
file-aged working man whom the police
man is holding against a telegraph pole
to keep him from falling. He Is quiet and
hangs to the pipe which he Is smoking,
though It threatens to make ' of him ln-
The policeman on the sidewalk makes
a gesture toward the saloon and the offi
cer of the patrol goes in with him. A
moment passes and the crowd makes a
movement toward the curb. The officers
Â¦warn them back and come through an
alley of humanity bearing between them
tie limp figure of a man. He is hatless,
and his race is rigid in the lantern light
as they lay him softly down. In his
hand is clutched â¢ a whisky flask. The
officer says laconically, "Fit!" Then he
runs to the nearest patrol box and "rings
in" to the police station, and the clear
air brings his voice â "anything more for
the wagon V
"AH right. Jack; Harbor Hospital." and
the horses turn the headlight of the wag
on toward the water front. .
Just a flicker of curiosity from the mot
ley crowd of Kearny street as we go
clanging at a swift pace to the streets
of the Italian quarter. We 'scatter the
children that swarm over the cobble
stones and draw up with a last warning
gong before the door of a little tobacco
chop with a saloon in the rear. The light
of the street lamp shines over a crowd
of dark faces, some curious, many full
of the ready sympathy of the Latin race.
Even where the patrol wagon enters
often it draws an audience. It holds the
stage better than a drama.

Many, in all walks of life are striving: for ,
the . crown of greatest joy and of chief
honor. Who performs a higher task, a
nobler work than the queen of the home

most difficult and a great work. When*
can be found a finer instance of heroism
than that of a mother training, develop

She fits them to bless the. world and to
be forever blessed in eternity. â¢.-
It Is not a question whether a mother
will Influence her children or not, but how
she will influence them. Her Influence is
potent whatever it may be. It was Na
poleon, who ever recopnize' 1 tt"Â» cower \
of mothers' Influence, who said: "The fu
ture good or bua conduct Â»>Â» ciÂ».Â»u de
pends entirely on the mother." This is
rather a strong statement, and it seems
to underrate the influence of the father
for good or eviL "But still the fact re
mains," as Dr. Theodore Cuyler says,
"that It Is mainly the mother who shapes
the home Influence and Imparts^to it It3
prevailing atmosphere; for the most im
portant, part of moral education is at
mospheric. The purity or impurity, the
tonic or the demoralizing qualities of
that atmosphere of the home depend, for
the most part, on the mother, as the
sovereign of the home. There Is her
throne; there la her sway; there she can
make or mar the destiny of the immortal
soul beyond any onÂ« this side of the
throne of God." .â¢'â¢â¢Â¦'. â Â»
The mother's Influence over her chil
dren being so powerful and permanent,
sha plays no small part In shaping great
national ends. All great legislators hava
felt this and acknowledged this.
Scotland, In her high reverence for
motherhood, , Insists that "an ounce " of
mother Is worth more than a pound of
clergy."
Napoleon, who cherished a high con
ception of a mother's power, when asked
which were the best training-places for
recruits, replied, "The nurseries." He
believed that the mothers of thÂ» land
could shape the destinies of France, and
bet said, '"The great need of France is
mothers." It Is said, to them he looked .
for help In Inspiring those traditions of
glory which enabled his raw and half
fed soldiers to sweep away from battle
field after battle-field the chivalry of Eu
rope.
An ancient orator, referring: to the pow
ers of Roman mothers, said, "The em
pire Is at the fireside."
What a memorable example Is furnish
ed us In Spartan history of the influence
of mothers In shaping national ends. It
is said the Spartan nation had no walla to
its capital except the breasts of its noble
defenders. That being the case we can
â¢ readily sea why tha mothers and the
whole nation should desire beyond all
things else that their boys should ba
"heroically brave and Indomitably hardy
in the endurance of pain." A Spartan
mother replied to her boy when he com
plained to her that his sword was too
short, "Add a step to It." Another Spar
tan mother as she gave to her son a
shield, said, "This, or on it," meaning
either to bring It back or be brought back
upon It dead.
The nation that doesn't revere woman
as wife and mother retards Its own best
development. Those nations which have
kept womanhood in a condition of servi
tude have lived Ions enough to rue their
folly. What hope can any people have
whose women are in such a condition
that they pray, as the women are said to
have once done in Hindoostan. "Oh.
Vishnu, let not my child be a girl, for
very sad is the life of woman!"
If the mothers of this land could but
realize that they hold the secret of true
reform and the making of the future o !
this great country largely In their own
keeping and would live in keeping with
this great truth, casting.' aside all the
weakening follies of fashion and soul

The power of mother's influence is seen
in the position to which the civilized
world exalts her â queen of the home-king

The "Idler" gives U3 an interesting story
by Mr. John Bigelow, who had given io
the Kaiser of Germany a little cruising
canoe of American make. The Emperor
accepted it with considerable enthusiasm,
saying "All boys shall be canoeists."
Â¦The Empress, in conversation with Mr.
Bigelow soon afterward about the canoe,
listened to his glowing description of
shooting down a swift stream, then
through foaming rapids and between dan
gerous rocks, and when he had finished
she said: "Oh. no! That is too danger
ous. I shall never allow my children in
a canoe."
"But," protested Mr. Bigelow, "the Em
peror has already given his consent."
"Oh. that may be," said she. with the
sweetest of smiles to her husband. "He
may be Emperor of Germany, but I am
Emperor of the Nursery."
I The fact is, whatever the father may
be in the home, the mother is "Emperor
at the Nursery," and in her hands she
holds largely the training and safety of
the hearts that abide there. As John
Gray has said. "The hand that. rocks the
cradle rules the world." History proved
this to be a great truth. The men \.-hu

bore and bred them. Mothers are the
sculptors of the men and women who
make our history; their Influence teha

patriots, ablest statesmen, most profound
scholars, most holy ministers of God, re
ceive their stimulus to all their excel
lence and usefulness from their pious
mothers. Because the love of sons for
their mothers is the strongest and tender
est of all affections, the influence of
woman must always be a strong factor in
the history of the world.

A NAIGHT ON THE PATROL WAGON
THE SUNDAY CALL.
5JOHN LUTHER LONG wrote that
remarkably clever little story,
"Madame Butterfly." Many will
probably remember the dramatized
version of It that was given some time
ago at a local playhouse. For its deep hu
man interest, its delicate charm and its
entirely out of the ordinary conceit of
plot it won all hearts wherever presented.
"Madame Butterfly" tells the tragedy in
the life of a young Japanese Geisha girl
who, through the passing whim of a navnl
officer, becomes; his wife. He r^ards the
match merely as an episode of a few
happy months passed in the land of flow
ers and sunshine and sails away to his
native land, leaving abundant promises
to come again some day to see his little;
Japanese wife. Madame Butterfly ..re
mains true to what she is pleased to con
sider an American wedding and not one of
Japanese custom, and her, only thoughts
are for her golden-haired child and her
sailor lover. The officer does return to
Japan, but he brings with him an Ameri
can wife, to whom he has confessed his
foolish entanglement of former idle days.
The wife condones the offense' and Is
anxious to adopt the child. They imagine
that for a few dollars the * Geisha's
wounded Â¦ feelings will be more than
soothed and their minds are only dis
abused of this idea by the tragic suicide
of poor little Madame Butterfly, who,
with all her perverted Ideas of morality,
according to our code, is yet truer, to her
offspring and the natural laws of nature
and of right and wrong than this man
who goes as a leader among men.
"Madame Butterfly" is such an artistic
creation that it seems a shame to men
tion In the same sentence the last writing
of this talented, but uneven, author,
"Naughty Nan," published by the Cen
tury Company of New York.
"Naughty Nan" tells the story of a
supposedly up-to-date New TorK girl with
decidedl> bohemian tendencies. Nan! has
an. aunt, who, to save '-her for an English
clergyman to whom she ,; had â¢ been Â£ at
lotted in childhood, calls in the assist
ance of a nephew to care for the wtllf ul
beauty while the aunt takes a trip. to
Europe. The nephew _â¢ is to . become en
gaged to Nan, that is, as far as the world
knows. This make-believe , betrothal is
supposeo to keep away the bohemian
lovers and to throw Nan and the nephew
together as much as possible that he may
keep an eye on her and save, her "for
Cawdor." Of course Nan and the nephew
fall in love, but the man uses every ef
fort in his power to be true to the trust
imposed on him.. Nan decides to win him
in spite of himself by getting another man
to elope with her, knowing that her lover
will follow. She plans to have him over
take them, then to tell the man with
whom she has eloped that for him she
cares nothing and forthwith to throw
herself on the nephew's mercy to marry
her and save her good name. This fairy
dream materializes Into a railroad acci
dent In .which the nephew sustains in
juries that frightfully disfigure his face.
Nan nurses him, but when he Is off the
sickbed and the bandages taken from his
face she finds the slg-ht more than she
can bear and disappears to leave him to
his fate. ;
Then comes any quantity of trouble for
the nephew, but he finally beats out
against fate in the end and wins Nan for
his bride after allâ by the aid of Mr.
Long's fertile imagination. Â¦-.*. ,
The beginning of the story promises
well, for the dialogue is snappy and
bright; but the remainder of the book is
strained and silly. It will appeal to those
whoare fond of "gallery play" ; if you
care for the improbable, lurid and mawk
jpv, Â»N*Â»t'<rhty Nan" will hold out a gleam
of sunshine for you in the -book world.

following apologyj really, where no apol

The play would only occupy : about* a ;
half-hour, and about the same time to
read, but through the lines you read vol
umes and the story of all times and peo
Â¦ples.'The plot can be told in a half-dozen
lines. The heroine lives in the Italian
quarter of New. York. She is overcome
by homesickness for her sunny Italy, and/
when a former lover's voice is heard be
neath the window singing one of the old
songs she induces her husband to call him
up that she may learn the song. The
lovers agree to return to Italy, but the ;
wife is overtaken by an accident while
attempting to escape from the room' unob
served by her husband and is brought
back dead 'in her lover's arms. The play
is so strongly human and so filled with
life as life is that you find the simple
characters, once known, are in your mind'
to stay. Play "reading" Is not as enjoy
able as play . "seeing," but Mr. Fry's ef
fort, even in book form. Is better worth
'your while than many of the loosely con
structed, badly written dramas now
' shoved at our heads by energetic man
agers. Mr. Russell has used all the pub
lisher's art to make the little book what

The Lovely Mrs. Pemberton.
A book without' a likable character in
it Is what Florence Warden has accom
plished in "The Lovely Mrs. Pemberton."
There may be those ivho will mingle their
tears vrlth the rather too ready tears of
the heroine over the difficulties that come
of having an adoring husband whom she
is not quite sure of loving until the last
, page of the book; of being spied upon
* everlastingly by a green-eyed, prying spin
ster aunt, who resents her nephew's mar
riage; and of having attracted the notice
of an unscrupulous old libertine, who
takes advantage'df her youth and his own
IN the volume of verse entitled "Lin-,
coin and Other Poems," which repre-'
sents the latest "work of Edwin Mark
ham, the lines which show the influ
ence of inspiration are in the minor
ity. At times it seems as if Pegasus
had had to be gently prodded now.!
and then In order to be kept go- j
ing. Then. too. in many of the poems J
there is an over-insistence upon the beau
ties of liberty, equality and fraternity.'
Xot that these themes are unworthy the:
notice of the greatest genius; but, after j
all, poetry is one thing and a course of.
lectures on socialism another.
It is a legitimate matter for speculation :
whether or not in future books of verse
Mr. Markliam intends to complete the se
ries of meditations on first beholding
certain famous paintings, by pursuing an
uninterrupted course from Tedder and
Miliet back to the Renaissance. There
are three new "meditations" in the pres- J
ent volume. '
In spite of certain blemishes of artlfi- i
ciality, there are lines In the poems .so j
tine that one could wish that a writer,'
capable of producing them would be con- j
tent to write but little, if only he couUi '
make all of his work of the same high j
quality. For instance, consider the" best!
parts of the following poems: ;
LINCOLN".
Ti*hcn the Norn Mother saw the Whirlwind I
Hour.
Oreatetiinc and darkening as it hurried on.
She bent the strenuous Heavens and came down
To make a man to meet the mortal need!
She took the tried clay of the common road-
Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,
Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;
Then mixed a laughter with tne serious stuff.
It was a stuff to wear for centuries,
A man that matched the mountains, and com
pelled
The stars to look our way and honor us.
The color of the ground was In him, the re4
earth;
The tang and odor of the primal things â
The rectitude and patience of the rocks;
The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;
The courage of the bird that dares the sea;
The iustice of the rain that loves all leaves;
The pity of the snow thai hides all scars;
The loving kindness of ,ihe wayside well;
The tolerance and equity of lieht
That elves as freely to he shrinking weed
As to the great oak flaring to the wind â
To the grave's low hill as to the Matterborn
That shoulders out the sky.
And so he came.
From prairie cabin up to Capitol.
One fair ideal led our chieftain on.
Korevermore he burned to do his deed
With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.
He built a rail-pile as he built the State,
Pouring his splendid strength through every
blow.
The conscience of him testing" every stroke.
To make his deed the measure of a man.
So came the Captain with a mighty heart:
And when the step of Earthquake shook the
bouse.
Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold.
He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again
The rafters of the Home. He held his place â
Held the lcr.g purpose like a growing- tree â
Held on through blame and faltered not at
praise.
And Â¦when he fell in whirlwind, he went down
As when a kingly cedar green with boughs
Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,
And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.
OUR DEATHLESS DEAD.
How shall ve honor them, our Deathless Dead?
With strew of laurel and with stately tread?
With blaze of banners brightening overhead?
Kay, not alone these cheaper praises bring;
They will not have this easy honoring.
Not all our cannon, breaking the blue noon,
Not the rare reliquary, Â¦writ with rune.
Not all the Iterance of our reverent cheers,
Not all sad bugles blown.
Can honor them grown salntlier with the years.
Nor can we praise alone
In the majestic reticence of stone:
Kot even our lyric tears
Can honor them, passed .upward to their spheres.
Nay. we must meet our august hour of fate
As they met theirs; and this will consecrate.
This honor them, this stir their souls afar.
While the/ are climbing to fen ampler star.
The soaring pillar and the epic boast.
The flaring pageant and the storied. pile
Slay parley with Oblivion awhile.
To tare some Sargon of the fading host;
'But these are vain to hold .
Against the slow creep of the patient mold.
The noiseless drill of the erasing rust:
The pomp, the arch, the scroll cannot beguile
The rrer-cirdlng Destinies that must
Mix king and clown into one rabble dust.
Ko name of mortal Is secure in etone:

"A "few years ago, when a certain
young man of rank was. charged with a
particularly heartless ; crime, at least a
score of silly women promptly f ell head
over heels in love with him, and inun
dated his solicitor with messages of sym
pathy, offers of financial, help and of mar
riage. Every day of his trial some of
them attended the court and exhausted
every stratagem to get a word with him,
and when he was sentenced, to five years'
penal servitude one woman, an absolute
stranger to him, fainted in court.- J
"So infatuated was one of his admirers
that she went to live in the neighborhood
of the ', prison where he served his sen
temce, and was happy if she caught a
glimpse of him on his way to the quar
ries. Whether she married him or n at ul
timately I cannot say, but it was cer
tainly not her fault if she didn't." .'.'Â¦Â¦.
"In another case,' which occurred Â¦} at
about the same time, a young and pretty
girl was charged with the manslaughter
of her child under peculiarly sad condi
tions. Her case excited wtde sympathy,
and to my certain- knowledge at least a
dozen men wrote to make her offers of
marriage. After' a long trial she was ac
quitted, arid one of her numerous suitors,
a man of some wealth and social position,
found a' home for her and at the end or
six 'mouths led her to the, altar. This
strangely united couple are now living on
the Continent, and, as I. hear from a
friend of mine who is an English chap
lain there, are happy together. . -
"It is comparatively seldom that thl3
Infatuation fcr a criminal leads to matri
mony as promptly as in the case of a
clever and notorious . French swindler,
who was recently brought before a
French court on a serious charge. Among
his many admirers was a young woman,
who fell so violently in love with the
prisoner that she declared she would
marry him in orison. "
"She applied to a magistrate for the
requisite permission. 'Is it true that you
wouid like to marry this manT'the mag
istrate asked. 'Yes, sir,' she answered,
'I love him very â¢ much, and it would
make us both happy forever.* Permission
was given, and the prisoner and his de
voted bride were married at the local
Mayor's office, with four policemen as
witnesses. It will probably be some time,
however, before they are in a position to
enjoy their honeymoon.
"A still more remarkable story comes
from America," said the English clergy
man. "Some years ago a young and at
tractive woman , was charged with a
grave offense, and "although it was found
that the crime was committed under in
fluence which the girl was powerless to
resist, she was sentenced to a long im
prisonment. The -Judge whose painful
duty, it was to inflict this sentence was so
moved by pity for the girl that I ho fre
quently visited her in prison, and was so
struck by her natural charm, intelligence
and modesty that he fell in love with her.
"When her sentence had expired ha met
her at the prison gates and drove her
away in his own carriage to a home ha
had provided for her, and a few wee&s
later she -became the wife of a man who
a few years earlier had been her Judge
and punlsher. This caae, which Is well
known in America, proves that It is not
only the young and foolish In whom a
criminal can inspire love and loyalty.
"Another case which Is within my own
knowledge is that of a bank clerk who
was charged about three years ago with
embezzlement. It was proved In evidence
that he had committed the crime in jot
der to help a- brother who was In finan
cial straits, and fully hoping -and Intend
ing to replace the money before it was
missed. His case excited considerable
sympathy at the time, and In none more
than in the daughter of the barrister who
defended him.
"The young man was sentenced to a.
merely nominal term of imprisonment,
and on his release called at the house of
the counsel who had defended him lo
thank him again for his kind offices. Here
he met the girl, who was able to express
her deep sympathy with him in his mis
fortune, and thus commenced an ac
quaintance which quickl- , ripened Into
love.

married with tha father's approval, and I

PECULIAR CASES OF SILLY INFATUATION
Indian Etiquette.
THE Bed Man and Helper, published
by. the students at tha Carllsla
(Pa.) Indian school, has this to say
on Indian etiquette: **Xt was an
actual desire for information and no at*
tempt to be fanny that a boy la looking
'up from reading about 'squaw men* asked
if the white women who marry Indian
men were called 'buck woman,' We could
not answer why they were not. Such a
name would be no more insulting to a
woman than tha first appellation ti to a
man. All Indian women axe no mora
squaws than white woman are. wenches.
The name squaw emanated from *Â»qua/
an Indian word of a Massachusetts tribe
meaning woman, but it has sine* com*
to be used commonly by illiterate yeople
for Indian women of any tribe. No edu
cated or refined people use tha words
'squaw' and 'buck,' and wa adrlsa our
students when they hear them not to pay
any attention to the speaker, but to mark
him or her down In their minds as a per
son of low breeding."

were hundreds of Indians from all the
country round hunting every dajÂ» for that
fifty-dollar coin, which to '. them wis
easier than earning the same amount.
They never found it. And I? I will tell
you what became of that coin.
"There was a saloon near by. A place
where one could buy everything to drink
and to .make one merry. That coin had
disappeared from my fingers within five
minutes. I could spare it. But could I
spare the memory of the glorious intoxi
cation it bought for me? Never!" .< './
' It was at the same fiesta that /Pico
made the dishes fly.
"I was on ray horse and was standing
in front of the old women's booths," re
lated Castro. "The old women always set
up little booths with tamales for sale and
baked squashes filled with milk. Â» They
were standing around as thick, as seeds
in a pumpkin when up dashed
Pico behind me. Â¦ He was a boy
then Just as I was. He Jumped upon
the horse behind me. 'Get up,' he cried,
and lashed the horse. It gave a trem n
dous leap and dashed straight through
tho booths, scattering tamales and
stuffed squashes and . dishes and old wo
men on the ground, while shrieks rose all
around. There was a mass of women and
dishes in every direction that we looked.
'Never mind, I'll pay for everything,'
shouted Pico, and on we rode."
Old Majin's stories of early day hunt
ing make to-day's sportsmen yellow
with envy. Throughout Contra Costa
County the canyons were full of elk, and
Contra Costa County included what is
now Alamecla County as well as its
namesake. These elk could be seen run
ning through the great mustard fields,
their horns reaching above the - yellow
tops of the flowers. They would make
tremendous dashes for the oaks of what
is now Oakland and hide among them
when the lasso was in pursuit of their
horns among the mustard.
Old Majin was a famous roper and
rider, as his father was before him, and
his daring led him into risky adventures
plenty of timers.- There was one occa
sion when he was still a schoolboy at
San Jose. He was returning to San
Pablo, where the old Castro ranch .was,
siccompanied by some schoolmates.
"We saw. a bear in a canyon. The
beast was eating a beef which it had
stolen, as is always the way with bears
when they get* a chance. I have little
opinion of bears. We said, 'Let us lasso it.'
â¢"I v/as always headstrong and headlong

He never gave up bis hop* at going to
Mexico. "I shall have money some day
and then I shall go," he kept saytag.

Castro said. "It Is the finest of wheat."
He refused over and over again to so to
tha poorhouse and he nevwr did. He was
satisfied to live with his black coffee, his
cigarettes and Pioneer. The horse's man
ger was full of crumbled French bread,
which the baker furnished him after It
had become stale.
Majin Castro never married, but he said
that there were three things on which he
was authority. They were wins, women
and horses. He had the tastes of a thor
oughbred sport. "I am 66 years old In the
day. but at night I am SB," he said once.
."If I ever lose him I shall begin to go
down hill." he said, and, true enough, his
worst fortune dated from the death of the
horse.
His elegant clothes had Ions; ago disap

which he clung to, besides his courtly man
ner, was the wearing of long whiskers
brushed out at each side, In what had
once been known as the "style of the
king." He was dressed in rags, but he sat
his horse like a king as long as he was
able to ride. He. was paralysed after
ward; but for years Oakland knew the
old man as the rider of Pioneer, the great
white horse that he clung to as his only
friend.
"No, for it cost $100. It Is the style now
to wear those like yours, costing a dollar
and a half." replied Majin.
"That hat isn't the styla any more." a
man had said, and laughed roughly at

The 196.0C0 acres that constituted the
beautifu] Sobrante ranch had all slipped
away from him long before his death
but he kept up the fancy that It was still
bis.- He had sold parts of It when he
was drunk and claimed It back In rain
when he was sober. The rest had been
deliberately taken ' possession of by the
Americans, whom he regarded as his per
sonal enemies to his dying day. He used
to Insist that the land was still his and
claim that the various squatters owed
him rent for years back.
"I can't collect what they owe me," ha
would complain, "but they will be pun
ished when I die. I am going to will all
the land to the railroad, and the railroad
people will send all the squatters off the
land in short order."
AH the northern part of Contra Ccsta
County .from Grizzly Peak to Martlnea
was his in fancy. Sobranta had contained
its own graveyard, as" was customary
with the old, ranches! When the squat
ters came there . was one woman from
Missouri who settled on that spot most
sacred to old Majln.
"I couldn't make her get off," he used
to mourn. "She wouldn't move, although
I offered her anything she wanted for
that one. spot. It was my grandmother's
grave that she built on." â¢ "
During the last years of his life he lived
around in cheap lodging-houses In- .Oak
land, and was dependent upon what little
he could earn as a veterinary surgeon
who was old and feeble and not always
sober enough to attend to business. Be
sides this, he broke wild colts for hire.
Nobody in all California knew more about
horses than did he. But his Spanish
blood rose when be was called a vaquero.
He would have it understood that he was

Majln was educated at the Mission San
Jose, where he studied about as much as
a boy can whose time is* largely taken up
with the cares of riding and hunting and
lassoing. He used to tell of a certain
fiesta at the mission, the most splendid
fiesta of them all, when he made a rec
ord for himself on horseback â a record
which he proudly lived up to during the
most of his life. -< .'
"There was a bad horse at a ranch near
the mission. Nobody could break It. I
was asked to. I said I would and I did.
Then I was asked to ride It at the fiesta
and to try some feats on its back.
"I knÂ«y that any feats would be dlffl-

I was very proud to He on the bare

way, with a Back of jerked meat under
my head for a pillow.
"In the night I awoke. I f olt that some
thing or some one was near me. I turned
over to look, and there, near by me, stood
a great bear.
"The woods and canyons around there
were full of them, but I was not accus

camp In the middle of the night. I was
surprised. I could think of only /one
thing to do; that was to turn over and

might please him tt/do. I was unarmed,

"Therefore, I turned over and lay still.
The bear advanced and came close. I did
not know what he could want of me. but
he seemed to be headed yy way.
"I had turned with my back toward
him. I could hear him stealing closer and
closer, and at last I could feel him snif

that I thought he was considering what
kind of a meal I should make.
"I felt him nosing my pillow. Then a

my pillow of Jerked meat out from under
my head and was making off with hia

spot by our fire and sat down to eat
the meat.

THE last of the Castros Is dead.
Old, Majln Castro, the only re
maining son of the' famous Califor
nia Governor, lies burled In the
Potter's Field. He was killed by a
passing train, crushed, mangled, carried
to the Morgue. Nobody was left to bury
him except the Impersonal public.
In the. days of his youth Majln Castro
had ridden the fleetest horses* had daaoed
at the gayest fandangos, had scattered
silver to the poor like crumbs to the birds,
had dined and wined the wealthiest and
most elegant of California's Spanish
swelldom. The Americans, the "worthless
coyotes," as he always called them, had
come long years ago to his native State,
and after that the vast estates of, the Cas
tros had melted away like dew. just as all
the Spanish estates did. Majln Castro
died penniless and in rags.
It was a pathetic death ,and we have to
acknowledge It, even If he did call us hard
namesâ we, "the enterprising Americans.
Gradually he had seen great wealth slip
through his ifngers â the easy fingers of
the early-day Californian, fingers better
fitted to scatter than to grasp. He began
life as the son of a wealthy man. with all
the privileges that go along with wealth
and distinction; he spent his last years
dependent upon the good nature of any
body who happened to show it. When ho
was killed hie body lay for three days un
identified in the Morgue at Oakland and
was finally laid In the Potter's Field.
After burial his cane and clothing were
Identified by two Oakland people, who
recognized also the photograph which tho
Morgue officials had taken of him.
Castro held a greater stock of old Cali
fornia etoiies than any man hereabouts.
These stories were seldom told, though,
for people la.usb.ed at them. They made
Jun of him when he told of his exploits at
bear killingâ he, a crippled old man, how
could he ever have roped bear? And as
for his wealth and his fine friendsâ why he
was a penniless old mar.; with barely
clothes enough to keep him warm: what
could he ever have known of fashionable
life?
So Majln Castro kept still. He did not
want to be laughed at_ When he went to
a bar he did not tell stories over it. He
had long ago learned his lesson; that
these .stories passed as a joke to his hear
ers, and that they thoupht of him only
as a beccared old cripple. He kept silent
except to a few, a very few who sympa
thized, and It was only when in his cups
that even these could Induce him to talk
about the past with perfect freedom.
For he drank splendidly; he drank lUce
a true old don. And he smoked, too, like
one of the elect. He rolled his cigarettes,
even at the end, Â¦when his hands had be
gun to tremble; he rolled them as only a
Sranlard can do.
"As long as I have my black coffee and
my cigarettes I can live," he always said.
But he was wrong. Neither his cigar
ettes nor his black coffee had failed him
v.-hen he died.
It was neither of these, though, that
led him to tell one of his friends the story
of the robber bear. It was the wine that
is redâ the wine that drew stories out of
him and made a don of him once more.
/'It happened in the camp on my
father's land," he said. "The old es

is promptly hoisted amid the sails to dry.
A new one is passed over and the fishing
begins all over again, but In exactly the
same way. Just as soon as the. dry one
is lowered the gulls all fly chattering
away and not one is to be seen until the
net drags heavily. Then they are about
in full force.
After every wlggly^ member. is out that
net is passed to the "other boat, where it
Box after box was filled and when the
net was light enough to lift on deck there
was a general "Yo-heave-ho," and there
she was. As it is so enormous they can't
empty - it as onÂ© ordinarily would. The

and then the two parts drawn apart and
there you are, with flsh, flsh everywhere,

Now and then a few would wiggle out
of the net or would drop from the scoop
and qpicker than lightning would be
pounced upon by the other eager set of
fishermen. Some gulls became so sated
that it was almost impossible for them to
fl^ away. They sat on the water like
tame birds and I could reach out any
where and pick them up by the dozens.
Day after day they wait for the flshboats
to Bupply the.ir daily meal and as day
after day passes and they are not harmed
in any way they get as bold as brass.
But how those fellows knew when the net
was nearing the surface was what puz
zled me. They know more than they are
given credit. for it seems to me.
Just when I was wondering whether
they could pull all that weight on board
at once, I saw the sailors run after what
looked to me like immense butterfly nets
that youngsters play with. In a twinkling
they were scooping the squirming mass
out. When the scoop was filled they
pulled a string that was /fastened to the
handle and away went the fish tumbling
one over the other into the boxes that
were standing about for that purpose.

really, that is not so dreadfully deep,
either. Six hundred fathoms of rope is
now and thon let out when the fish are
particularly lively.
Suddenly a gull commenced to squawk
and instantly his call v/as answered. In
side of five minutes there were thousands
of screaming, croaking birds circling and
circling- about the boats.
"The net coma near. The birds know
it is eat lima," said one of the men in
answer to' an inquiring glance. "See, de

All sizes and conditions, almost all varie

ously to their imprisonment.
When the flsh were in sight, the Alex
ander threw us~a second, rope and cast
loose from us, so that the net could be
drawn on board the Henrietta.
Think what It means. Two tugs, four

That's what It amounts to when fish or
Three hundred and fifty fathoms. Think'
of it! There are six feet to a fathom, and
350 times 6 makes Just about 2100 feet deep.
Imagine going that far for a tomcod or a
crab for dinner.
"Oh, only about 250 fathoms," the cap
tain answered nonchalantly. "The fish run
deep and we have to fish deep, for them."
"For heaven's sake, how much rope did
you let out?" I finally demanded, after I
had been forced out of one corner and
Into another and out again to make room
for it.
As I crossed the deck I saw. any amount
of rope â simply heaps and heaps of it.
And coil after coil was being thrown from
the drum, and the fish were no nearer the
surface.
Each boat slowly winds the rope up on
a drum with a block and tackle. The
force pulled us backward, and we ran
side by side, with the net tugging and
pulling between us, . for about a mile.
"You no drinka de wine? No? Then
watcha the" fish coma, up," and ha sig
naled to the men that the net was com
mencing to drag heavily.
Ugh! 'Wine, of all things, when that
boat was treating us in such a playful
fashion.
"Coma out and drinka de wine. It maka
you strongâ very strong. You f eella bet

pushed a demijohn toward us. "Wine's
good for everybody," as the bottle was in
midair.
Both tugs stfam slowly forward for an
hour and a half, or possibly two hours,
just as it happens, but very slowlyâ just
enough to keep the net from picking up
all the snags on the bottom. During this
time the fishermen eat and drink, and
drink and eat. And then they do it all
over again. There isn't anything else they
can do just then, and they do everlast
ingly make the most of their time.
One ship passes the rope to the other,
and they almost come together. With a
dexterous twist the end of an immense
net is landed on the deck 6f the twin,
and then the two slowly glide apart until
the net is taut.

To say the least, it was weird.
When the "potato patch" was reached
the boat eimply stood on end. The billows
were mountains high and we plunged and
tumbled about as though we were a bit of
cork. The waves broke over the pilot
house and the glass splintered into a
dozen . pieces. They reared, foamed and
eplashed, but still the Henrietta plowed
along her course. The lights of the city

The dress of the groom and best man
Is the regulation afternoon dress for gen
tlemen. Frock coat, striped trousers,
white, waistcoat, white silk tie, patent
leather shoes and a silk Mt. -
The maid of honor and the bridesmaids
wear frocks of light color and picture
hats. They often carry an armful of
flowers and ropes of the same are twined
and . Intertwined about the arm. Again,
they carry parasols literally covered with
blossoms. That is very effective, and
during the flower season not expensive.
White Is the proper color, and it is by
far the prettiest and most appropriate
one that could be chosen. . "We think It
must be high in the neck and made with
very long sleeves, but I have noticed in
Paris that the neck Is frequently bare
and that a band answers full well for
sleeves, if that Is smart there it will be
only a matter of time before it will be
stylish here. It really does not make so
much difference about the material,
whether it la costly "or not. It Is the ef
fect that is wanted. .As a nils a wedding
gown answers its mission and Is laid
away In a chest for the . grandchildren.
The veil is what should be considered.
One made of talle Is much more becoming
and infinitely less expensive than lace.
It is fastened with almost anything. Often
with the gift of the groom, which these
days seems to run to diamonds. Orange
blossoms are sweet and symbolic and do
quite aa well, some people think better,
but that is merely a matter of taste.
The frocks, of course.
And now that the ceremony and recep

full well what that is.
I have 'never notice*! that any needed

themselves, and do It well, too.
ThÂ« young people are all Important that

bride,, they; are always introduced to her
before her parents are considered. They
are a secondary consideration.

and 'How can I see to shave in the

once who was visiting me and who came

dark, shaving. I have a watch without
a crystal and I can feel the position of
the hands and- tell the time almost to a

He was taking the. induction coll from
an old-fashioned stand telephone pre
paratory to placing it in the base of the
new style stands which are now made
altogether. I tried to get him to talk of
his work. .
"I would probably be only a lineman or
something of that sort if this blindness
had not come into myllfe. It has brought
all my faculties to a focus and made me

blindness as part of his life and- accom
modates himself to It, for rebellion haj
taken a back seat -in his heart. "When
your time comes It comes and man can
do anything to hasten or retard It," says
Thomas Nichelson now.
When he first realized that blindness
was to be his lot courage failed him. He
could not face life with. the light of day
gone forever, and his youthful, unfulfilled
possibilities forever wiped out.
He became despondent and tried to take
his life. He wanted to end It all, but
fate miraculously snatched him back.
"I am going to the theater to-night with
the boys. I want to get home and get
cleaned up and take a shave In the dark
and giat down there before the curtain
goes up. I like to hear the whole show."
We watched him dodge the machinery
and followed him to the door, where he
jumped on a passing car and was lost to
sight.
"Isn't he a crackajack?" said one of the
boys. "Did you see him dodge that

Nichelson took off his apron and went
straight to the hook where his hat and

"He uoesn't like to have us help him,"
said one of the boys.
"Good-night, Bill. Good-night, Tom.
Say, you have a new coat, haven't you?
And Jack, you have changed your ring
to the second finger."
"I am rather proud of my record, for I
haven't made a mistake yet, but I am
not boasting and I don't want to get care
less. To be as nearly perfect with my
work as possible â that is my pleasure."
It Is hard to believe that Mr. Nichelson

the street with his head up. He walks
straight ahead and people make way for
him just as they do for any man wno

BLIND WIZARD OF THE TELEPHONE.
A" history of his life and the peculiar,
chain of circumstances that led him to
do this work is interesting. Thomas Nlch
elson did not always live in the world of
darkness.- He used to be a messenger In
the employ â¢ of the - company. He was an
observant little fellow, and as that fac
ulty is usually coupled with a 'good mem
ory, hls'mind to-day is peopled- with pic
tures. The fact of his having seen once
enables him to' get a correct picture of
his work. .When old. phones come In for
repair he sees the dirty tangled wire. and
the unpolUhed surface is apparent when
he runs his fingers ov^r the surface, for
he can tell when the nickel is off. Then he
goes Â¦ about L changing the picture Â¦ and
bringing a satisfactory one to the fore.
One day, ten years ago, "little Tom Nich
elson.'was' fooling-" with a> copper .wire,
when ; a bit flew oft and lodged in his eye,
and ,: caused â¢â¢ the loss of Its sight It
waa not long before the other eye became
Inflamed out of sympathy, and both had
to be taken, out.;
Back in the repair shop of the great
telephone factory he sits and works from
8 to 5 daily, adjusting -telephones for the
busy world outside. Great accuracy is
required In making the delicate connec
tions of the copper wire'of the Induction
coil in the base of the stand. One would
think that eyes of the keenest quality
would-be necessary, but this. young man
fixes up from thirty ' to forty per day^ or
over 10,000 a year, besides d<jlng the deli
cate, repair work of the factory, which is
all turned over to him. :
Every stand telephone. used on the Pa
cific Coast passes through the, deft fin
gers, of this blind wizard; who gives to
each 'â¢ its' finishing touches before it goes
out into the world to speak for itself. "
But such is the case.

This Is the best developing exercise
for the arms" that can be imagined; it
also develops the muscles of the neck
and back. When perfect in the exercise
It will be possible to perform the neat
little centrifugal experiment of the whirl
ing of an open dish of wate*r rapidly
around the head without' spilling a drop.
A few months of this exercise will per
fect the arms of even a delicate woman
most beautifully and increase her physi
cal strength to a point where she may
without effort control her entire house
hold. A. husband who sees his : wife
whirling several quarts of fluid around
her head with the grace and lightness
of a butterfly upon the wing 1 will hesi
tate about differing with her in mere
matters of opinion.
After these movements the arms should
"When this can be accomplished with
ease and accuracy with the right hand,

sary with the left than the right hand.
nearly as possible at right angles with
the body. Swing in this way at the rate
of about fifteen movements to the minute.
The shoulders must be swung with the
arms, or the exercise will have little
value. The hips must keep their natural
position, and not swing with the shoul
ders.
Another movement for the upper arm,
and for the lifting muscles as well:
Raise both arms slowly, until they are
in the position shown in illustration No. 2,
then perform half circles with the hands,
by turning them back and forth. The
muscles must be held rigid. For giving
the back part of the upper arm a difficult
piece of work to do. stand about two feet
from a wall, just at a level with and op
posite the shoulders. Keeping the heels
all the time on the floor, let the body set
tle forward until the chest touches the
wall, keeping the elbows near to the sides,
the knees never bending a particle, and
the face upturned; now push sharply off
from the wall until the elbows are again
straight and the body at .vertical. Repeat
these movements many times daily. De
scribing a circular movement with each
arm. many times in succession, and ex
tending the arms forward, outward and
upward, at least twenty times in succes
sion, is admirable work for forearms, up
per arms and shoulders.
What is called the windmill movement
with dumbbells is also admirable forearm
development; It is a continuous motion
backward as well as forward, with one
arm, and with both arms simultaneously.
The motion with .both arms begins with
the arms hanging down; they are then
raised forward till they reach a vertical
position the thumbs being pointed up
ward ; the arms are lowered in as large
circles as possible.
The turning motion is admirably adapt
ed for giving soft, sinuous curves; double
both hands until they look like pugilists'
fists, and hold them before the chest;
lower the clinched hands and straighten
the arms out on a line with the body,
with tte palms upward. This makes a
turning of the entire muscle of the arms.
Then turn the '.arms In the opposite direc
tion, bringing them to the front of the
body, and finish by leaving the clinched
hands where they started from. This Is
particularly for Increasing' the sizo of the
upper arm.
It Is well to bear in mind that If the
right side of the body is used much in
playing games, some minutes daily should
be spent in practicing the left arm and
side to correct any 'tendency- to one-sided
ness. - â¢'Â¦'Â¦.--
An exercise which Â¦ develops all the
muscles from shoulder to tips of fingers
is the corkscrew movement. Stretch up
one arm at a time, and with the hand
twist the muscle, starting at the shoulder.
This produces a series of corkscrew or
eplral curves that are really beautiful. A
certain actress who has classically perfect
arms keeps â¢ them in condition by. just
such exercises.- She also spends some
time, every day rajsing and lowering. her

May I suggest a few exercises, which,
if taken regularly, are bound in time to
improve the shape of the arms. In the
morning, after being partly dressed and
before the corsets are put on, is the
ideal time for any muscle-developing
exercises, for at night one is apt to be
fatigued.
Onp, however, cannot hope to attain
proper artistic proportions and correct ar
tistic curves by a spasmodic devotion to
athletics. Daiiy exercise for twenty or
thirty minutes is essential to give a wo
man arms fit to be modeled for a Hebe.
Kor must the exercise be violent â that
would only develop the muscles at the
expense of curves.
When It comes to measurements with
a tape line, however, authorities differ
upon the point cf the correct length of
the arm; it may vary from 2S 7-20 inches
to 29 7-10 inches an^j not offend the lover
of a mathematically correct form. The
aim of the woman who is devo'ted to
who goes in for fencing, for
irFtance, should h#ve the latter measure
with the length from shoulder to el

ellOUND and flowing outline with p.
-constantly changing curve from
shoulder to elbow, from elbow to
wristâ this Is beauty's recipe for
a perfect arm.
The arm at the shoulder is just as im
portant as the arm at the wrist; a shapely
shoulder sloping quickly from the throat
to the arm. It goes without saying that
the flesh must be white, with a skin soft
and smooth as satin itself. The arm
should be rather short, particularly frota
shoulder to elbow, the iatter being dis
cernible, not from the joint, which natur
ally must be there, but from the bewitch
ing dimples which play hide and seek in
the curves of the soft, white flesh with
other dimples disporting themselves dt
the weH-rounded wrist. It is in the wrist
mainly that we have difficulty when we
art looking for perfection. The bone is
utually too conspicuous both at wrist and
elbew. not being sufficiently cushioned
with fleshâ too much flesh, however, does
not necessarily make a weil-rcunded arm.
The following are the proportion for
an arm fit for a sculptor to model, and
which, perhaps, if not already possessed
of, one may attain unto by daily extr
ciw::
Length of arm from shoulder to finger
tips 287-50 inches.
Length of arm from shoulder to elbow

Around upper arm 10 inches.

This faculty is necessary to every one in whatever line of work he may
be. The perceptive faculty is a good one for boys and girls to cultivate, and
like others it can be mastered only by application.
Success in. life in every line depends on application to the matter in hand,
and this faculty is a very essential one in all lines. These young men here
may be the Pierpont Morgans of the future and these young* ladies the wives
of millionaires. Large duties will de volve on them. You may have to enter- c
tain large companies and you must remember the names and faces of your
guests. This brings in the' faculty of observation and memory. In fact, in
ail walks of life the leaders are those that have risen through strict atten
tion to details, which is a great factor of success.
When you get home at night try to remember what transpired during the
dayâ each "little eventâ and the people you have come in contact with. Culti
vate the habit of remembering dates: and faces.
I hope to see you again some time and talk to you .individually on differ
ent subjects. You are looking. at me and I am looking at you, and I hope t
we will know each other next time we meet. When you see me on the street
come up to me and see if I can remember you. Come up and say: "How
i^.o you do? Don't you remember me?" fcee if I say, "Yes, I met you at the
Lincoln School Wednesday, March 12." That .will put me to the test. See. if
1 i-ractice what I preach. If I don't remember you, then you'll have the laugh
on me. Good-day. . -..-.Â¦'

ed. I like to notice people and I like to have people take notice of me.
Mv business Is one that requires me to notice closely people and their

servation. I have to pay close attention to details and store them up in my
mind and be able to recall them at any moment.

A MEMORY TEST FOR A PRICE
HEBE is the first installment in
a memory test for a prize. It
is not only unique; it is ex
ceptionally important and interesting
to parents and children alike.
Or. Wednesday afternoon, March
12, a representative of The Sunday
Call arranged, through Super
intendent of Schools Webster,
to have forty pupilsâ eight each
from the Lincoln, Clement, Ham
ilton, Horace Mann and Mission
Grammar Schools respectivelyâas
sembled in one of the classrooms of
the Lincoln School to listen to a short
talk by Chief of Police Wittman, and
to reproduce the same as a memory
test, together with a minute descrip
tion of the speaker as an observation
test.
The childrenâ the brightest and
cleverest in their classes â were equal
ly divided as to sex, four boys and
fotfr girls from each school, but the
object of the meeting was kept a pro
found secret from them. Not one of
them knew whp.t they were to do,
who they were to meet, or what they
would say. It was to hi a memory
test pure and simple, with absolutely
nothing to put them on their gpiard
befcre it began. They did not even
know that there was to be a reward of
merit. They were told to report at
the Lincoln School and await develop
ments â nothing more.
The Chief was unavoidably de
tained by the Grand Jury and arrived
half an hour late. He was ushered
in with the brief introduction, "This
gentleman will say a few words to
you." Without any prelude he made
the brief speech which was taken
down verbatim and which will be
found elsewhere on this page. Then
he left immediately.
After he was gone the children
were- given the fifteen questions, also
reproduced on this page, and asked
to answer them as nearly correct as
possible. The result is, surprising.
Children are SRid to be even closer
observers of personal peculiarities
than grown-up people, and as Chief
Wittman is p. man of most notable
appearance, he was a good subject to
test their receptive faculties. The
impression he made on some of the
pupils is astounding. One boy
thought, after the Chief had gone, that
be was about 7 feet high.and weighed
about 150 pounds. Others couldn't
remember a word of what he had said,
while still others gave good answers
to all th? questions.
The test is truly interesting us
showing the value of school training.
As. a reward the five children who
gave the best answers will be taken
to the Lick Observatory â¢ on Mount
Hamilton by The Sunday Call, be
cause such a trip presents exception
ally fine educational advantages, be
sides affording a pleasant outing. As
a supplementary reward a prize of
$15 will be given to the boy or girJ
who writes the best description of che
trip. Watch for the second install
ment next Sunday.

" 'Thar dawns a hour, however, when
my p'siticn in the van of Kentucky ton
comes within a ace of bein' seriously
shook. It's on my way to school one
dewey mornin' when I gets involved all
inadvertent in a onhappy rupture with
c polecat. I never does know how the
misonderstandin' starts; an after all the
j>eeds of said dispoote is by no means

without the aid of rum.- I determines to
cast the opprobrium on some other boy
an' isend the hunt of gen'ral indignation
sweepin' along on his trail.
" 'Thar's a innocent infant who's a
stcodent at this temple of childish learnin'
an' his name is Riley Bark. This yere
Riley is one of them giant children who's
only 12 an' weighs 300 pounds. An' in
proportions as Kiley is a son of -â¢ Anak,
physical, he's dwarfed mental; he ain't as
well upholstered with brains as young
ones of six an' seven. That's right; Riley,
mental, is like a fly in a saucer of syrup;
he struggles 'round plumb slow. I decides
to uplift Riley to the public eyes as the
felon who's disturbin' that seminary's
sereenity. Comin' to this decision, I points
at him where he's planted four seats
ahead of me. all tangied up in a spellin'
book, an' says in a loud whisper to a
child who's sittin" next: Â¦
Throw him out!" |
" 'That's enough. No gent will ever
realize how easy it -is to direct a people's
sentiment ontil he takes a w'irl at the
game. In two minutes by. the teacher's
bull's eye copper watch, every soul know3
it's pore Riley; an' in three, the teacher's
done drug Riley outdoors by the'ha'r of
his head an' chased him home. Gents
I look back on that yoothful feat as a
triumph of diplomacy; it shore saves my
standin' as the Beau Brummel of the Bloo

" 'Good old days, them!' observes the
Colonel mournfully, 'an' ones never to

I tells you-ali prior, shore fills me full of
moss an' mockin' birds in equal parts. I

ILopyr lasted, 1902, by Robert Howard Russell.)
PANTHERS, what we-all call 'moun
tain lions,' " observed the Old Cat
tleman, wearing meanwhile the
sapient air of him who feels
equipped of his subject, "is plenty
furtive, not to say mighty sedyoolous, to
Ekulk. That's why a gent don't meet up
with more of 'em while pirootin' about in
the hills. Them cats hears him, or they
sees him, an' him still ignorant tharof;
with that they bashfully withdraws.
"Which it's to be urged In favor of moun
tain lions that they never forces theni
ee'fs en no gent; they're 6hore consider
ate that a-way, an' speshul of themse'fs.
If one's ever hurt, you can bet it won't be
a accident. However, it ain't for me to
go' 'round impugnin' the motives of no
mountain lion, partie'lar when the entire
tribe is "strangers to me complete. But
still a love of trcoth compels me to con
cede that if mountain lions ain't cowardly
they're shore cautious a whole lot. Cat
tle and calves they passes up as a heap
too belicose, an' none of 'em ever faces
any animile more warlike than a baby
colt or mebbe a half-grown deer. Once,
I'm riding along the Caliente when I
bears a crash-in' in the bushes on the biuff
aboveâ 200 foot high, she is, an" as sheer
as the walls of this yere tavern. As 1
lifts my eyes a fear-frenzied mare an'
colt comes chargin' up an' projects them
se'fs over that precipice. They're dead as
Joolius Caesar when I rides into 'em,
while a brace of mountain lions is skirtiii'
up an' down the aige of the bluff they
leaps from, mewin' an' Lashin' their long
tails in hot enthoosiasm. Shore, the cats
has been chasin' the mare an' foal, an'
locoes 'em to that extent they don't know
where they're headin', an' they nacher
ally makes that death jump like I rebates.
I siams away with my six-shooter, but
beyond givin' the mountain lions a con
vulsive start I can't say I does any exe
cootion. They turns an' goes streakin' it
through the pine woods like a drunkard
to a barn-raisin.'
"Timid? Shore! They're that timid sem
inary girls compared to 'cm is as Bternly
courageous as a passel of buccaneers. Out
in Mitchells Canyon a couple of the Lee-
Scott riders cuts the trail of a mountain
lion an' her two kittens. Now, whatever
do you-ali reckon this yere old tabby
does? Basely deserts said offsprings
without even barin' a tooth, an' the two
cow punchers takes 'em gently by their
tails an' beats out their joovenile brains.
That's straight; that mother lion goes
ewarmin' up the canyon like she ain't got
a minute to live. An' you can gamble the
limit that where a animile sees its chil
drtn perish without frontin' up for war
it doesn't possess the commonest rocdi
ments of sand. Sech, son. is mountain
lions. ,
"It's en.- evening in the Red Light
when Colonel Sterett. who's got through
his day's toil on that Coyote paper he's
editor of, enfolds concernin 1 a panther
round-up which he pulls off in his ynoih.
" 'This yere panther hunt.' says Colonel
Sterett. as he nils h's third tumbler, 'oc
curs when mighty likely I'm goin' on
seventeen winters. I'm a leader amon?
rjy young companions at the time; in
fact, I allers is. An" I'm proud to say
that my soopremacy that a-way is doo
to the dom'nant character of my intel
lects. I'm ever bright and sparklin' as
a child, an' I recalls how my aptitcode
tor learnin' promotes me to be r^gyard
ed as the smartest lad in school If
lhar's visitors, or if the selectmen in
vades that academy to sort o* sizÂ» us
up, the teacher allers plays me on 'em.
Id go to the front for the outfit. Which
J'm wont on sech harrowm' occasion* to
recite a odeâ the teacher's dene wrote
It himse'fâ an" which is entitled "Napo
leon s Mad Career." Thar's tvrenty-four
stanzas to it. an' while these inter
iopin selectmen sets thar looking' owley
&n sagacious I'd wallop loose with the
twenty-four verses, stampin' up an'
cown an' accompanyin' said recitations
with sech multltood of reckless gestures
jt comes plenty clost to backin' every
body plumb outen the room. Yere's the
first verse:
I'd drink an' ew'er an* r'ar an' t'ar
An' fall down in the mud.
While the y 1 earth for forty miles about
IÂ» klvered with my blood.
T? *You-all can see from the speciment
" 'No one comments on this yere ad
venture; not a word la heard. Each is
silent, ontil we mounts the first hill. As
we collects ourse'fs on this eminence, one
of the Brackenridge boys holts up bis
hand for a halt. "Gents," he says, asâ
hosses, hunters an' dogsâ we-all gathers
'round, "gents, I moves you the Chevy
Chase Huntin* Club yereby stands ad
journed sine die." Thar'a a moment's
pause, an' then as by one Impulse every
gent, hoss an' dog says "Ay!" It's yoo
nanimous an' from that hour till now the
Chevy Chase Huntin' Club ain't nothin*
save tradition. But that panther shore
disappears; it's the end of his forage; an*
ag'in does quadrilles, pra'rs, an' poker
resoom their wonted sway. That's the
end, an' now, gents. If Black* Jack will
caper to his dootles, we'll uplift our
drooped sperits 'with the- usual forty
drops.' " v- ,- \< Â¦Â¦â¢
" 'No, thar'a nothin* further to do. an'
less to be said. That calvacade. erstwhile
:so gala an* .buoyant, drags Itself weari y
homeward, the exhausted dogs walkia*
stiff an* sore like their laigs is wood in
the r'ar. For more'n a mile the com
plainin' howls of the hysterical yaller dog
is wafted to our y'ears. Then they ceases;
an' we figgers his sympathizin' master
has done took him into the shanty an'
shet the door. ,
" 'Now ensooe3 a scene to smite the
hardiest of us with dismay. No sooner
does the panther find him? in the \
midst of that he'pless bevy of ;..tl.Â» ones
than he stops, turns round abrupt an'
sets down on his tail; an' then uplittih*
his muzzle he busts into shrieks and yells
an' howls an' cries: a absoloote casu of
canine hysterics! That's what he is; a
great yaller dog; his reason is, now a
wrack because we harasses him them
eighteen miles. ,
"'Thar's a ugly outcast of a squatter,
mattock in hand, comes squanderin' down
the ' hillside from some'ers out back o?
the shanty, where he's been grubbin': '
"â¢"What be you-ali eediots chasin' my
dog for?" demands this onkempt party.
Then he menaces us with that implement.
" 'We makes no retort, but stands pas
sive. The great yaller brute, who nerve3
has been torn to rags, creeps to the squat
ter an' with mornful howls explains
what we've made him suffer. Â¦' -\ * .
" 'Thar's a log house ahead; out in
the stump- filled lot in front is a -frowsy
woman an' five small children. The pan
ther leaps the rickety worm fence an'
heads straight as a bullet for the cl'arin!
Horrors!, the sight freezes our marrows!
Mad an' savage, he's doo to bite a hunk
outen that devoted household! Mutooally
callin' to each other' we goads our horses
to the rescue. We gains on the pan
ther! He may wound, but he won't have
time to slay that fam'ly.
"'Gents, it's a soopreme moment! The
panther makes for that female squatter
an' her litter; we pantin' and pressin'
clost behind. The panther is among- 'em;
the woman 11 an' the children seem trans
fixed by the awful spectacle, an' stands
rooted with open eyes an' mouths. Our
emotions shore beggars descriptions.
" 'But the end comes. We've done run
him into a rough, wild stretch of coun
try where settlements is few an' cabins
roode, an' wide an' far between. Of a
rudden the panther emerges onto/ the
road an' goes racin' along the trail. We
pushes our spent steeds to the utmost.
. " "As I states, we harrows that foogi
tive panthei for plumb eighteen m;iea,
an' in our hot ardor founders two hosses.
Which fatigue an' weariness begins -to
overpower us; also our prey weakens
along- with the rest". In the half
glimpses we now an' a'gin gets of him
it's plain that both pace an* distance is
tellin' fast. Still he presses on; -an' as
thar's no spur like fear, that panther
holes his flyin' distance.
" 'For myse'f I'm prepared. I've got one
of these yere orihuppy cap-an'-ball six
shooters that's built doorin' the war; an'
I shorely cuts that weepon, loose! This
yere gun seems a born profligate of lead
that a-way; for the six chambers goes off
at once. Which you should have seen the
Chevy Chasers dodge.' An. well they may;
that broadside ain't in vain! My aim is
so troo that one of the r'armost dog3
evolves a howl an' roils over; then he #ata
up gnawin' an' Hckin' his off hind laig in
frautic alternations. > That hunt is dona
for him. We leaves him doctorin' himstj'f
an' picks him up two hours later on our
triumphant return.
" * "Thar he goes!"
an' ever an* anon givin' a encouragtnf
shout as we briefly sights our game.
" 'Gents,' says Colonel Sterett, &a he re
freshes himse'f, it's needless to go over
that hunt in detail. We hustles the flyin*
demon full eighteen miles; our faithful
dogs crowdln' close an' breathless at his
coward hocks. Still, they don't catch up
with him; he streaks it like some saffron
meteor.
" 'Only once does we approach within
strikin' distance; that's when he crosses,
at Old Stafford's whiskey still. As he
glides" into view Crittenden shouts:
" 'Our dogs is plumb sta'nch; they shore
does themse'fs proud. Singin' in twenty
keys, reachin' from growl's to yelps an'
from yelps to shrillest screams, they
pushes dauntlessly on the fresh trail of
their flyin'.but ferocious quarry. Now an*
then we gets a., squint of the panther as
he skulks from one copse to another Jest
ahead. Which he's goin" like a arrer; no
mistake! as for us Chevy Chasers, we
parallels the hunt, an' contlnyoos poundin*
the Skinner turnpike abreast of the pack,
" 'One of the T witty boys rides: down
an' puts the â¢ eighty or : more dogs into
the bresh. The rest of us lays back an*
strains our eyes. Thar he is! A. shout
goes up as we descries the -. panther
stealin" off by a far corner. -He's headin*
along a hollow, that's- full of Â¦ bresh an*
baby timber, an' runs parallel with the
pike. Big an' yellow he is; we can tell
from the slight flash we gets of him &a
he darts into a second clump of bushes.
With a cryâ what young Crittenden calls
a "view halloo"â we goes pirootin' down
the pike in pursoot. . .
.", Thar's forty dogs if thar's one in
our company as we pauses at the Skinner
crossroads. An' when the Crittenden
yooth returns,, he brings with him the
Rickett boys an' soaie forty added dogs.
Which' it's worth a ten-mile ride to get
a glimpse of that outfit of canine t Thars
every sort onder 'the canopy; thar's the
stolid hound, the alert ficeA the sapient
collie; that is, thar's indivyiyooal curs
wherein the hound, or fice or collie seems
to predominate as a strain. But the
trooth is thar's not that dog a-whinln'
about our hosses' fetlocks who ain't
proudly descended from full fifteen dif
ferent tribes, /an' they shorely makes a
motley â¢ mass meetin*. Still, they're good,
zealous dogs; a'n' as they're goin' to go
for'ard an' take most of the resks of
that panther, it seems invidious to criti
cise 'em. . Â¦â¢ -. ; .
" 'Gents, I ain't above admittln' that
them news, puts my heart to a" canter.
I'm brave; but conflicts that a- way with
wild an' savage beasts is to me a novelty,
an' while I faces my fate without a flut
ter, I'm yere to say I'd sooner been in
pursoot of minks or raccoons, or some
sech varmint ' whose grievous cap'bilit'es
I can more ackerately stack up, an' in

However, , the dauntless blood , of my

s'nal to su'gest it.vi searches forth a
flask an' renoos my sperit; an' thus quali
fied for perils, come in what form they
may, I resolootely stands my hand.
" 'When this yere reign of terror is at
its heights, the local eye is rolled toward
us Chevy Chasers. We rises to the op

Then they p'ints down to a handful of

HOME MAGICShould it be politics?
He felt he might succeed if he tried.
Faith in himself was one of Rhodes'
strong elements.* But what did success
mean? In South Africa the top of the
pole was represented by the Cape Pre
miership. Who -were the Cape Premiers?
He had known some of them, and to
him they seemed merely men who had
alternate spells of office and opposition.
Most of them were mediocrities; few had
power even when they held place.- No,
"this was- not good enough."
. Should it be religion? ,
Mr. Rhodes was not, in the accepted
sense of the word, a religious man. He
was born in a rectory, but parsons' sons
are not noted for piety. Was there in
the churches a. goal great enough to be
worth the devotion of a. life? VPerhaps,"
he thought, "if it were true." .But ha
iras a Darwinian and an agnostic, not a
Christian. He believed in evolution.
Reincarnation did not interest him.
"Life is too short, after all," he used to
say, "to worry about previous lives. Froro
the cradle to the grave, what it it?
Three days at the seaside. Just that
and nothing more. But although
it is onjy three days, we must do
something. I cannot spend my
time thrown stones Into the
water. But what is worth
while doing?
No, he could not devotf*
himself to any church
But out of these the
istic questions, which
he argued to himself in
his calm, practical
way, was gradually
evolved the great pur
pose that actuated his
every thought and act. â¢ 'Â¦<
By degrees it grew up
on him that the teach
ings of all 'religions were
based upon a God who rule*
over all the children of men
and who would exact a strict ac
count for all the deeds which they 4
did in the body. He did not yield'..â
his agnosticism; he merely decided it -
was an even chance that there might : be
a God. When he had figured it out to thia Â¦
point, he asked himself: "If. there be a A
God. of which there is an even chance,
what does he want me to do, if so be that
he cares any tklng about. what I do?".' â¢'-?
He kept on 1 thinking. Being â¢ an evo-
than safe-keys

whole of their life
consumed in con
stant worry of see

ination is crashed by their
millions. A political career is
barricaded against them b'y
their. own money-bags. A crowd
of parasites and beggars swarm
round them like mosquitoes round a
weary wanderer In a southern swamp.
They can do nothing, see nothing, risk
nothing. They sit like golden Buddhas,
cross-legged in an Eastern temple, eter
nally contemplating their gilded paunch.
Wealth for which they havtp given the
best years of their life is only a care, nof

O LITTLE done: so much to do."
\^^ These were the dying words of
y J Cecil Rhodes, the Colossus.
k^/ So little done.
+ Is it so little for a man to begin
with nothing and have a fortune of thirty
millions before he is 40? And to count
these millions a means, not an end?
Is It so little for a man to control the
Interests of two such companies as the
De Beers Consolidated and 'the Chartered
Company, one of which governs the en
tire diamond product of Africa, and the
other the destiny of the country?
la It so little to have been Instrumental
for years In keeping the British flag fly
ing over oae of the, richest regions In
East Central Africa: or to have designed
and executed a campaign for establishing
British authority over the kraal of Lo
fceaguLa, chief of the man-Â«laylng Matu
beles. whose devastating raids made min
ing In Mashonaland an impossibility until
peace was brought about?
!â¢ It so little to stretch a telegraph line
more than half way from Cape Town to
Cairo, through desert country and jungle
and the mountain retreats of savage
blacks?
Is It so little to have built more than
K0O0 miles of railroad through this same
country, with its fevers and poisonous in
sects and. wild beasts?
Is It so little that one man, hampered
by government opposition, should fore
stall the German and the Boer in their
hcpe of South African supremacy, and
add to the British empire a tract of
country five times the size of tne British
Isles?
Is it so little that a wide region that
was once the site of savage blood-orgies
has within a decade been dotted with
modern cities, and that the savages them
selves have been taught habits of regular
industry?
Is It so little for an obscure curate's
Bon to become an uncrowned tang, and
have It said of him "Cecil Rhodes is Brit
ish South Africa and British South Af
rica is Cecil Rhodes?
Is it. Indeed, a little thing to have
forced England into a war that has al
ready cost her nearly a billion dollars, and
fifty thousand men, with the end not yat?
These are but part of the record of a
man, a private citizen, whose name will
stand out as one of the greatest, if not
the greatest, of a century.
To him .these things seemed little be
er, use of the things undone.
Â£0 niuch to do.
Cecil Rhodes is dead at 49, barely man'*
prime.
'iÂ«o years hence he hoped to flash his
tiist message from the Cape to Cairo.
beven years hence he hoped to drive the
I lu.st spike in the Cape-to-Cairo railway
the lirst transcontinental road span
r.ii.g a continent from north to south,
the- tirst to cross the equator at riglu
angles. Â¦ . '
.Heriiaps before that time he hoped
to realize his dream of empireâ who
bo far above the ideals of the com
mon mind were those of this stupen-
C'jus genius that it is impossible to
conceive a life work tnat might have
satisfied his ambition.
Cecil Rhodes began life with handi
cap; Â»cixiÂ«j might Bay a double handi
cap, lie had weak lungs and a pool
father. The second he counted as a
bleastXVt tor he has said:
"I\o iiM.11 should ever leave money to
nisi chiiuren. It is a curse to them. What
we .- .1 Â¦> 1; j â¢â¢! <io for our children, if we would
do them the best, service we can, is to
give them the best training we can pro
cure for them and then turn them loose
in the world without a sixpence to fend
for themselves. What happens when you
leave children fortunes? They have no
longer any spur to effort. They spend
their money on wine, women and gam
bling, and bring disgrace upon the name
which they bear. No; g:ve your boys the
best education you can and let them make
their own way. As for any money you
have, it should ail go to the public
"/erviceâ to the state in some form or an
other. They tell me," he added, laugh-
Ing, "that that Is statp socialism. I can
not help that. These are my ideas, and
they are right."
Sent to Africa with only a twelvemonth
Df life allowed him, the Oxford undergrad
uate joined an older brother who had ob
tained a claim in the then almost unknown
Kimberley diamond mines. The brother,
tired of a miner's life, turned over his
claim to Cecil, who found himself respon
sible for a tract of earth that with every
turn of the soil revealed untold wealth.
The pure, dry air of the African veldt
worked wonders. And wnlle recovering
his health Rhodes laid the foundation of
a great fortune.
Then, with characteristic doggedn6ss
and tenacity of purpose, he returned home
and completed his studies at Oxford. He
was not a bookworm. His life at the uni
versity was more social than Intellectual.
But he went through the term, of an un
dergraduate's study, took his degree in
due course and returned to Africa-
It is related that one day in the year
1S78, two years before his matriculation.
two Britons were Journeying in a post
cart from the Cape to Kimberley, The
elder, niqued by the persistent applica
tion of the younger to his book, finally
overcame the Briton's normal indifference
to his associates and asked: "What are
you so Interested in?" "The thirty-nine
articles. I am learning them for the fli
vlnity examination at Oxford." The dili
gent learner was Cecil Rhodes, coming
from his college to resume the direction
of his enterpriser, in Kaffir land.
But even while thus pursuing his college
rubric Cecil Rhodes had determined in
his own mind what his future was to be.
He was but a youth of twenty-six when,
standing before a map of Africa, he placed
his hand across the Interior up to the
mouth of the Congo and the Great Lakes
and said: _
"All that shall be English. That is my
dream."
Cecil Rhodes' way of building a fortune
Â«*Jid not differ much from the methods
"Â«< which other millionaires have made
their piles. A fortunate selection of
diamonailerous soil, in which he had no
part, was the beginning of it all, followed
by patient manual toil In digging and
washing the dirt. When a nucleus was
once formed, then came the speculation
in buying and selling claims that goes on
in every mining camp. By degrees It be
came evident mat young Rhodes was on
the way to the top. The Jews there, as
elsewhere, had proved too many for the
gentiles. But there was one gentile that
was to prove too many for them. In a
brief time the contest for supremacy nar
rowed down to two men. one an unknown
clergyman's son â Cecil Rhodes; the other;
mountebank, circus rider, pugilist â Bar
ney Earnato.
Finaiiy, when the time came for amal
gamation of the various diamond inter
ests. Mr. Rhodes stood forth as -the amal
gamator, and the colossal De Beers Com
pany is the monument of his success.
The immense production of diamonds,
however, is not the chief distinction of the
De Boers concern, but rather an article
contained in the charter authorizing the
directors to appropriate from time to time
such funds as they deemed advisable for
political or imperial purposes. .
The proviso was introduced by Mr.
Rhodes and consented to by the others
through deference, not conviction. It was
one of Rhodes' fads, they said. Let him
have hie way. And he did, as was his
wont. Cecil Rhodes has: been one of the
few millionaires who not only accepted
lUe theory of state socialism, but acted
Â£;>on it. There Is probably not a man on
the face of the earth to-day who would
use his private fortune to build a railroad
in a savage country or defray the ex
penses of a war not sure of reimburse
ment. To the average millionaire divi
dends are the one idea. To Cecil Rhodes
it was not dividends, but his dream of
empire. He was a millionaire with an
imagination. His grand passion was
painting the map of Africa British red.
Cecil Rhodes was never a man of
phrases. He was a man of thoughts and
deeds. To those who think of him only
as an empire builder., it may seem strange
to hear that he was. much given to pon
dering seriously questions which, in the
hurry and rush of modern life, few men

lutionist he believed- In the- survival of
the fittest. .
When he had decided that the white
race was evidently the fittest he asked
himself which of the white races?
Then he took up another line of inquiry.;
What is it that Godâ if there be a: Godâ s
Is aiming at? What is the 'divine ideal
toward which all creation presses, con
sciously or unconsciously? And by sing
ling out the foremost specimens of man
kind and contemplating the moral qual
ities that distinguished them 'from the
rest he formed the idea that the secret
of the divine purpose is the discovery of
the race that would be most likely to
. universalize the broad general principles
of justice, liberty and peace. This brought
him quickly to the conclusion ' that the
English race, whether British, American,
Australian or South African, is the type
which has done most to establish justice,
promgte liberty and insure peace over â¢
the greatest area of the globe.
"Therefore," he finally concluded,
"if there bg a God and he cares any
thing about what I do I think it is
clear that he would like me to do
what he is doing himself. And
he is manifestly, fashioning the
English-speaking race as the

He went back to Africa wondering what
his aim in life should be. and this was
the basis of his thoughts as- he hunted
diamonds.
Should It be the pursuit of wealth?
That was the object of those around
him. He took note of them, and reached
this conclusion: "Increase of wealt/ ,
up to a certain point means increase
of power; beyond that point Â»?

Yet there are many who will always
think of Cecil Rhodes as a mere money
getter, a vulgar political adventurer; a
man who made millions for the lust of
gold; a man who held office for the lust
of power.
None knew better than Cecil Rhodes
the value of money. "Providence is gen
erally on the side of the big battalions."
was a favorite quotation of the continent
grabber. "My battalions," he added, "are
pounds sterllne."
When Rhodes was Treasurer-General of
Cape Colony, at the age of 28, General
Gordon met him and told of his .re
fusing a roomful of gold offered by the
Emperor of China for crushing the Tai
ping rebellion. "Oh, what a wasted op
portunity!'* exclaimed Rhodes. "I would
have taken as many roomfula as I could
have got."
Rhodes was a genius at raising "bat
talions." Even his friends do not claim
that he was overscrupulous in the means
of doing it. They Justify It on the ground
of his utter selflessness and the greatness
of his purpose.
Â¦ As he felt the power of money, so he
knew the influence of politics. When he
thought that his alms could be best for
warded by going Into politics he set about
It with his usual restless energy, and
never took the pains to answer the charge
of his buying a seat in the Cape Legisla
ture. In his own good time he became
Premier, but when the time came -when
ho was stripped of official honors he
showed his superiority over title and posi
tion. Office had helped him in what he
had to do; removal from office could not
hinder him.
When Mr. Rhodes began to plan *he
building of his Cape-to-Cairo railway he
startled the world by announcing his In
tention of stringing a telegraph line from
the Cape to Cairo. Men Jeered. When
he asked for funds for laying the wires
the Stock Exchange for once was deaf to
his appeal. The Mahdlst rebellion was
then in full possession of Khartoum and
the Egyptian Soudan. How could Rhodes
hope to get his line through the Mahdi
country?
"Oh, as to that." he replied, with boyish
confidence, "when the time comes I shall
know how to square the Mahdi."
But people shrugged their shoulders, be
lieving the fanaticism of the Mahdi would
be proof against Rhodes' millions. Others
asked how te egraph poles wer.2 to be pro
tected from the white ants, those scav
engers of South Africa, to whom nothing
Is sacred that baa in It the principle of
life. .'.
"Make them of iron," replied Rhodes.
"But against the wandering herds of
wild elephants what avail wil] be your
Iron poles? They will be used as scratch
lng-posts."
"We shall see." was the reply. "And if
you don't subscribe for the Cape-to-Cairo
telegraph stock I will find the money my
self and go ahead."
Â¦ Nine-tentha of the money had to be
found by Mr. Rhodes personally, but he
at. once began the line, which he had
hoped to have In working order within
the next two years. .
The transcontinental telegraph project
had some claim to reason, for financiers
could figure out a dividend in its i arn
ings. Not so the Cape-to-Cairo Railwa>\
Yet Mr. Rhodes was none the less deter
mined to push it through, and three year.,
ago had set the date for the laying of ths
last rail on January 20, 1909.
But Cecil Rhodes is dead and there -a
still nearly 3000 miles of the road unfin
ished, and this through the most difficult
part of the continentâ so much to do.
Up to the time of the Jameson raid
Cecil Rhodes* career had been without re
verse. But an incident that might have
proved the undoing of a lesser man served
only to show his greatness.
"I am told that my political career is at
an end. I tell you, my public life is only
Just beginning."
These were the words spoken by Mr.
Rhodes at a public meeting in Kimberley
within a few days of the collapse of the
Jameson expedition. And he proved them.
He went home for trial, and with every
temptation to win an easy victory by be
traying his colleagues, he endured rather
the imputations cast upon him in silenco.
He did not lie; he did not betray the men
who had shared his confidence.
"Poor old Jameson," he said to a friend.
"Twenty years we have been friends. anJ
now he goes in and ruins me. I cannot
hinder him. I cannot go Â¦ and destroy
him."
There were those who stood aghast at
the effrontery with which Rhodes avowed
his own. baseness and his defiant asser
tion that he would conspire again, if need
be, taking care next time that his con
spiracy turned out successful; but while
the investigation made him the best
hated man in England, it sent him bacli
to Africa a greater hero than- ever. !i
did not hurt that men shouted "Pirate"
after him; their shouts were lost on thosi
who knew him to be the most notable
statesman in Greater Britain.
As became an' official known to have
promoted a conspiracy that failed. Mr.
Rhodes resigned the Cape Premiership;
but as a simple citizenâ and here was
proof .of his boast â his personal ascend
ency gained ground so steadily that when
the war came to a close the natives re
i fused to recognize any one but Mr.
Rhodes as chief of the whites. >
Among other things. Cecil Rhodes was
at this time frequently called a coward
by hig enemiesâ a moral and physical
coward. His cowardice was of thi3 sort:
When the efforts of the troops to dis
lodge the stubborn Matabele rebels from,
their fastnesses in the Matoppo Hills had
proved ineffectual, Mr. Rhodes moved up
and encamped at close range. The na
tives were holding a great indaba or
council in the hills a few miles away and*
sent .word Chat Mr. Rhodes might couie
to them, as they were afraid to come to
him. He went, with Colenbrander and
two others. He went unarmed. Escape
If there were treachery, was impossible
and the risk , of treachery was great. It
was his very fearlessness that overawed
them, and they laid their troubles before
him. Then he took them to task for
their murder of. women and children
talked with them as man to men. And
one* of the indunas answered: "Mv
father, greatest of chiefs, you have trust

here and our voice Is the voice of a na

For two months this man camped on

TO be for many years a staff secre
tary of Pope Leo XIII. and so to
be able to feel the influence of
and study the dominant character
istics of one of the great figures
of the world, is a privilege that many
people would wish for. One of the most
distinguished of the diplomatic secretaries
at the Vatican is Monsignor M. Antonini,
who is enjoying for the benefit of his
health a vacation tour of America, and
who for the past two months has been
the guest of the Catholic clergy in San
Francisco and other parts of the State. .
Monsignor Antonini is a man of most
charming personality and of great cul
ture. He has enjoyed his trip the more
from the fact that he is .very familiar
with the English language. He speaks
also six other languages, so that travel
ing for him is truly a matter of broaden
ing a mind that is receptive. His tour
60 far has been an endless succession of
visits, with Invitations, receptions and
addresses. He has many friends in Am-,
erica, to some of whom He has at various
times made Rome very pleasant, and
come of them are California people, who
have been more than gratified to renew
the friendship here. Monsignor Antcninl
has nothing but good words for America
and its people.
The distinguished churchman, who vras
Inducted into bis present office two years
before the death of Pope Pius IX. is also
Canon of the Basilica of St. Anastasia, a
church historically noted as being the one
under which excavations for early Ro-
man foundations were made during the
pontificate of Pius IX. The noted remains
unearthed included in part the site of the
ancient Temple of Hercules on the Roma
Quadrata, a long stretch of the Via Sa
crae, the ruins of the Circus Maxima,
and part of the wall built by Romulus
on the Palatine about 700 years B. C.
The church, which stands on the slope
of the Palatine Hill, aimoscin the center
of the Eternal' City, also contains the
most ancient relic known pertaining to
the mass. This is the chalice Qf St. Je
rome, dating back to the third century."
The altar of the saint Is also preserved
there.
No one who has visited this country
from Rome has been closer to the Pope
than Monsignor AntoninL Each day dur
ing many years has brought him into at
least brief touch with the holy father.
In speaking- of the daily life and the
health of the Pontiff, he said: "The pri
vate life of ! the Pope is so simple and
methodical that it affords little for dis
cussion. I know him as well as any one
could know him, and to me he is indeed
the king of kings, and the prestige of
his position is incomparable. Yet he re
tains at the age of 92 years the great in
tellectual force, the gentleness and pru
dence which have always been so marked
in his character. I hear constantly from
Rome, and the word comes that his Holi
ness is as well as when I left, when he
was in what might be considered as good
health, taking into consideration his ad
vanced sge and the demands which" are
dally made upon him. But he Is a very
careless person about his health. He is
frequently caught by the attendants run
ning from one room to another regardless
of the differences in temperature. And,
Etrange to say, he seldom contracts se
vere cold. He rises at 6, and, after say-
Ing mass and having a very simple break
last, he receives people from 9 o'clock
a. m. until 1 in the afternoon."
Monsignor Antonini . told . of the thou
eands of tourists who come to the Vati
can almost every week or month in the
hope of gaining a conference with the
Pope.
"People with all kinds of, prejudices
against him come there. First, many of
them come out of curiosity; "then their
curiosity turns to reverence, and when
they ha\e heard his gentle voice and hav e
Â¦een his quiet bearing their reverence
turns to affection. No man can resist the
SECRETS OF hidden ROOMS.
THERE lived long ago In the old
troublous times a Jesuit named
Nicholas Owen, who devoted the
greater part of his life to con
structing hiding places for perse
cuted priests.
The places were called "priests' holes,"
and were mad^ln various ways with the
greatest skill and ingenuity In the princi
pal Catholic houses all over England. Â¦-
As Allan Fea shows in his very interest-
Ing book on "The Secret Rooms of Eng
land," no precedents were allowed to bias
the choice of hiding places in those who
designed them, for the more remarkable
the place the less likelihood there was of
Its being discovered. One house would
have its secret room In a 'chimney, en
tered from the hearthstone, though cases
are recorded in â¢which a chimney pot un
eullled by smoke has led to the detection
of the prey, another would utilize a sliding
or swinging picture, like that one in
Lyme Hall, Cheshire; an innocent looking
"settle" would prove the ' entrance to &
hole, or a false floor would accommodate
refugees.
At Upton court a curious place {or con*
before the crucifix. The next lipartment
Is his study, equally as plain, with a small
green baize-covered writing table. Here
the Pope has composed some of the
verses which have marked himjas one of
the best Latin poets of his tlmd If it be
60 that he is able he still writes some of
these beautiful' thoughts eVidry day.
When he passes the worltl w^U be the
richer by many wonderful UneSjSvhich he
has still unpublished. Other Apartments
in his private. suite are the library and a
Â¦few other rooms for the transaction of
affairs. Into all these rooms .tJevoted to
the dally life of Pope Leo no 'tfutsider is
allowed to penetrate. The Pe":pe always
dines alone and his fare is tfugal and
simple, as is the rest of his regimen. The
library Is perhaps the richest ijfc furnish
ings of all the private rooms, a|id tt is a
wonderful place with its thousands of
volumes. Besides the manyff valuablo
books that were owned by him as Car
dinal before his election to :||he papal
chair, there are numberless voiames sent
him by authors, and they represent some
of the finest things in Catholicjand other
literature. Every took sent iio him Is
bound in white satin, with the Pope's
coat-of-arms In gold. Everything about
the Pope, as far as possible. Is of the
purest whiteâ his own color, and always
the color of his robes. Speaking of books.
It is wonderful that the Pope Is still able
to read and write without the use ot
spectacles.
"These rooms of the holy father havÂ«
no connection with the many rnag-nlScent
official apartments of the Vatican, about
which so much has been written. It Is
among these that are the ofllces of my
self and the other ' secretaries, who look
after diplomatic matters. The two men
who are privileged to be most constantly
with the Pope are his private servant, a
layman who has been with him In that
capacity for twenty years, and a priest,
who Is his private secretary. The holy
father speaks French well and easily,
with a slight Italian accent Liberality
of thought and a gent!" strength of pur-
pose are two prominent characteristics
noted In htm. Much of the money that
comes to him from gifts and other funds
he devotes to the most noble charities.
-He has recently built a splendid hospital
at Carpinatro. his native place, and thU
Is only one of his many benefactions. The
life of the Pope is not an easy one at any
time, as there is a vast amount of busi
ness that must come before him when he'
Is able to attend to it, such 'as the audi
ences given to pilgrims, the business of
Catholicism, the drawing up of encyclicals
' and briefs, many of which remain the
most â¢ finished productions In Catholic lit
erature. For recreation now . the Pope
takes drives in the Vatican gardens, hia
only other relaxation being studying and
the writing of Latin verses.
"In the chamber of special audience,
one who has been so fortunate as to be
granted the h/nor of being received by
the Pope will 'never forget the delicately
sculptured face, with its great attention
and eyes of piercing gaze. One feels
strongly the combined goodness and
genius of the Pontiff in talking with him.
and Â¦ when the audience is ended the in
telligent kindness of his look follows you,
as it called and entreated you from the -
soul when you entered. â¢
"Seated In an armchair with both arms
resting firmly on the sidesâ as is his wontjw
the Pope Immediately puts his visitor at
ease. He enters at once Into conversa
tion and draws out the best there is In
the one before him. His I3 a mind In

world and a mind that has studied well 1
the most important questions. His voice
Is still strong, at times wonderfully soâ
a voice that fastens his words upon you.
and you leave his presence with a soul
cheered up and warmed. Many who are
despondent have been encouraged and
supported by the gesture of those fingers
stretched out to bless. He scatters the
peace of his own life among those who
are near him. I may say that myself
and the other secretaries in company
with me, so necessary are our duties,
form, almost a part of the life of the
Pope, and if the Papal See were to be
moved, even so far as across the world,
we would still be removed with it. For
me, there seems nothing more to say.
Simplicity and purity are the two word3
that seem to me most fitting by which
to describe the holy fat'her and his daily
life and surroundings. It Is a matter of
Impossibility to say upon whom the
mantle of the holy father would fall In
the event of his death, but I do not
think It would be possible for the Slstlne
Chapel to ever see a more beneficent or
lovely presence within its sacred walls."
This American tour Is the first vacation
of any Jfength in Monsignor Antoninl's
busy life, and was undertaken solely for
his health. He remains in San Franciscr*
but a short time longer, and then leaves
for. Salt Lake City, whence he will start
on -a tour of the Eastern cities.

THE most . highly developed of ma
chine tools Is the automatic screw
machine and, like many another
contrivance for saving labor, its
home is New England. It Is a de
velopment of the ordinary steel working
lathe. . the intermediate step being the
monitor lathe, in which the various cut
ting tools protrude from the side of a
steel ; turret like 13-inch guns from a bat
tleship turret. â In the ' non-automatic
screw machine the turret'is revolved by
the operator, so as to bring each tool into
play, Just as the turret on the old Mon
itor was revolved to bring one gun after
another into action. But in the automatic
machine the work is done without human
guidance.
In jnaking screws, nuts, bolts, studs and
other ; small pioce3 that must be turned,
drilled or threaded for watches, clocks,
typewriters, electrical Instruments and
other Â¦ mechanisms, all the. operator has
to do is to feed the "stocw"â a long, thin
rod of steel or brassâ to the machine. The
feeding mechanism carries the rod slowly
forward Into the field of action. The.tur
ret advances and puts its first tool at
work on- the â¢ end of tho rod. When this
tool has done its task the turret with
draws it. turns and advances a second
tool into action. Each cutting tool
around the turret has its distinct work
to performâ one cutting a thread, another
shaping a head, another putting on a
point, another drilling a hole, still another
putting on knurling. The turret auto
matically brings each of, perhaps, six
tools Into action, and when the work 1*
finished the completed screw drops Into
a pan, while the "stock" Is automatically
fed forward to begin the complex opera
tion again. A stream of machine oil
pours continuously on the work to carry
an ay the heat and the little metal cut
tings collect in a heap under the ma
chine.
Hour after hour this wonderful automa
ton goes through its cycle of operations,
the turret clicking every moment as It
brings a new tool forward. Small brass
pieces, on which but one tool cuts, are
dropped at the rate of four a second.
Large screws of complicated design, upon
which a whole r turretful of tools must
work, are cut from a steel rod at the
rate of one or two a minute. So perfectK
are these screw machines constructed
that an unskilled workman can operate a
rcw of them. All he is required to do U
to keep them fed with ""Block." la aomo
shops girls tend the machines.â Frank

There are no signs of weakening on the
part of the Senators opposed to Cuban
reciprocity.
Although not pleased with â¢ the .order
announced. Morgan feels sure that the
Republicans will not allow the session to
close without a vote on the bill on ac
count of its effect on the coming election.
Opponents of the^Nicaragua bill will com
bine on the Spooner amendment, which'
authorizes the President to investigate
the Panama offer, and if the title be
found clear to purchase the property.
Friends of the Nicaragua bill will fight
this amendment to the very limit, and
when the final vote Is taken they feel
confident that the Hepburn bill will pass
by a eood majority.
Senator Morgan and other friends of
the Hepburn measure, however, are very
much dissatisfied because the canal does
not come before the Philippine tariff bill.
They will make a strong effort to havo
the order reversed, If possible, but Sen
ator Morgan- not being of the majority
party dees not feel at liberty to arguo
the political phase of the case with the
Senate leaders.
, WASHINGTON, Aprit 5.â The omission

NEW YORK. April6.-It was quite ap
parent at 1 o'clock this (Sunday) morn
ing in many sections of the city that the
saloon-keepers gave earnest consideration
to what occurred at the policemen's meet
ing yesterday afternoon, for they closed
their places at 12 o'clock sharp. Before
midnight they were free In saying that
they believed they would be arrested if
they violated the closing act and that
they did not purpose to take any risks.
Resorts that for years have been open all
right long put out their lights at 12
o'clock, and their managers announced
that the doors would not open again until
6 o'clock Monday morning.
The ministers who are members of the
New York Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal church, now in annual session
here, adopted a resolution Indorsing the
New York policemen for rebelling against
the system of police protection which it
is alleged has been in vogue In this city
for several years.
When entrance cannot be obtained to a
barroom where drinks are being sold the
policeman on post win visit a Magistrate,
after first telling his captain what he is
going to do, and get a warrant for the
barkeeper's arrest This will be a search
warrant, and will empower the server to
break into the saloon and make the ar
rest. In carrying out the scheme the pa
trolman's brother in arms, who is off
duty, will volunteer his time to assist the
nan on pott. Some of the policemen
look forward to no sleep to-morrow be
cause of the double work to be dne.
It is understood among- the men .that the
enforcement of the law is not to cease at
eundown. They have agreed to continue
their crusade until E o'clock Monday
morning, when the law permits the sa
loons to reopen. They also agreed not to
confine the enforcement to the excise law
alone, but to close all other illegal estab
lishments they may find In operation.

NEW YORK, April 5.-At a meeting of

was decided that the policemen would do

liquor saloon in the city to-morrow. Each
of the eighty-one precincts of the city
was represented at the meeting. A num
ber of the men present pledged them
selves to make arrests for excise violation
to-morrow, even though they might not
be en duty when such cases were called
to their attention. It was expected that
SOO or 400 men would be present at the
meeting. Instead more than 1000 men
Â¦were in the halL Many of the men present
were members of what is called "The
Second Platoon," who are on duty from
6 o'clock in the evening until midnight.
These men promised to forego their rest
in order to assist the men on post to stop
the Sunday selling. The men who are
assigned to court duty and other speclsl
details made the same pledges. It was
agreed that experienced men would be

they might be required.

WASHINGTON, April 5.â Secretary of
the Treasury Shaw has sent a letter to
each of the ladies who recently signed a
-paper addressed: to him complaining of ill
treatment, etc., at the hands of baggage
Inspectors at the port of New ; York. ; -
The letter-states that on receipt of the
petition. a circular letter was sent to each
signer asking, for a more specific state
ment and the facts upbn which ; the;'con
clusions recited In the .petition were
based. This circular was sent to 1020 la
dles, whose addresses were given, ln r the
petition. A little . over 300 were returned
for, want of sufficient address. Of the re
maining 700 the department has ; received
185 answer s on the following grievances: ,
'Â¦ "That receipted bills are not accepted as
proof of value; that duties are often Im
posed on old clothing; that trunks are
emptied on the wharf; that â¢ Impertinent
questions are asked." The answer,- the
Secretary says, may be summarized as
follows: :
. Number who report Illegal demand by officer,
none; number who claim to have paid on non
dutiable articles. Â«: number who report having
hfcd . receipted bills as proof of value, 10; num
ber who say . receipted bills were v not accepted
8d proof, 1; number who claim receipted bills
were accepted as proof, 15; number who clainÂ»
to have been personally humiliated by Imperti
nent questions, C: number who claim discour
tesy, 7: "number who eomulaln of Insolence of
ofilcers, 3; number who claim of discrimination
by -officers. 5; number who report having been
discourteously treated, 56; number who com
plain of delay, ti; number who have other
spscific.erievances, 16: number who -object to
method,pf Inspection, 40; number who say they
have hkd no personal experience, 12; number
who have not been abroad In three years, (J;
number who have never been abroad, 4; num
ber who report < having signed on representa
tion cf others,. 40; number who algned on gen
tral principles, 10; number who' object to-mak
ing any declaration, 41 ;â¢ number who object to
the-.Â«100 limit. 03; number who report havinj;
bribed inspectors, 2; number who know of
bribery, 3: "number who Â¦ reiterate the declara
tl6n* contained' in -the original petition favor
ing the enforcement of the law, 1; number who
object to the department's letter of Inquiry, 2.
/..The want of definite charges, the Secre
tary's letter continues, 'fenders . It well
Â¦nigh impossible to conduct a specific in
vestigation. The department, he -says,
will do all in its power to reduce legiti
mate cause of complaint to the minimum.
,The Secretary . says he is surprised that
ladies who signed the petition report so
little personal inconvenience. Continuing,
he says: . â¢
- If the plera were the property of- the United
States very Important changes might be made.
I have requested that the several steamship
companies provide a special room or that they
allow the Government to construct presentable
and If need be portable counters, with screens
about them, so as to permit seclusion. To this
end I ' suggest that the ladles who have po
courteously called my attention to this evil
Join in solid tine the steamship companies to
co-operate In remedying the same. :. â¢Â¦
It Is gratifying to recall that the original
petition directs attention to the fact that the
signers are-dceirous of the enforcement .of the
law. Quite x number of the responses to the
department's circular letter, recommend ' a
strict enforcement of the statute against such
person* ts attempt to smuggle. '
Â¦ I The Secretary then quotes the \ law re
garding a declaration' and an examination
and says that in the face of this statute
he does not see how either the declaration
or' the examination can be, omitted.-. In
conclusion he says:
V "And -now with- regard to:remecMes:"It
is the Intention of thedepartment to pre
pare a circular containing suggestions to
travelers, the' same to" be 'given, them as
they are lea.ving.our ports, and It Is be
lieved that- these will; be of assistance in
preparing aj-correct schedule .for. exam
ination on 'fhfelr return. : .A" deputy will

lncfvillty can be reported. Other modifi
cations will be made from time to time

two months when he : proposed to j Miss

Continuing, MIss^ Richmond avers that
the ' defendant falsely pretended he was
greatly , In love . with her and made fre
quent proposals . of marriage. It is al
leged that he persuaded her that he was
a man ; of considerable ability and won
her. confidence to such an . extent .as to
get her to deed . all her property to him,
that he might take care of it In return
for this he had a life Insurance policy for
$2000 made out in 'her favor, and promised
her that in the event of selling any of
the property belonging to her he would
give her a check for $4000. As a matter
of fact, plaintiff claims, she never re
ceived a cent from Jeffries. _
About four years ago Miss Richmond
remarked that In the; event of Jeffries'
death she would be left with nothing and
no tangible evidence of having any hold
whatever upon any of the property which
he owned, but which. In reality, belonged
to. her. '. Accordingly, in order to appease
her, Jeffries made out a note for $4700 on
June 20; 1898; which he gave her and
which bore Interest at the rate of 7 per
cent a year. Afterward, It is alleged, Jef
fries got possession of. this note, of the
insurance policy and of everything Miss
Richmond owned.
In 1899 Jeffries broke the news to Miss
Richmond that he was about to marry
Viola Sheward. Miss Richmond, he said,
was perfectly welcome to come and make
her home with him and his wife, and he
would take care of her, provided that she
never breathed a word about their busi
ness transactions.
Miss Richmond continued to live with
the Jeffries until November. 1900, by
which time, the complaint charges, Jef
fries had | secured everything of value
formerly owned by the plaintiff. Last
November Miss Richmond asked Jeffries
for the 'Â¦ note he had made out to her,
for the 'Insurance policy., and for the $1500

were Issued, the one being held by the a }?Z
tive agent of the company, the other by the
corrupt agent of the members of the Municipal

the passage of the ordinance was prevented.
The $135,000. corruption fund was demanded by
the legislators under the claim that^they had
done their duty, all they bad agreed to do. but
the company refused to honor their claims. .
The evidence, shows us that there are In this

tors-in large corporations - and prominent in
business and. social circles, who have not hes
itated to put up money for the purpose of brib
ing through the Assembly measures "In wnlcn
they were Interested. - When called before our
body some have added to the offense of bribery
the : crime . of ! perjury, and - only escaped thÂ«
Ignominy: of attaching to their infamous con
duct by reason of the fact that the evidence,
though satisfying our minds, would not be ad
missible In the trial courts. While legal evi
dence may be lacking to bring. upon them the
penalty for their . acts, yet they are morally
convicted and damned by their connection with
such debauchery. Some of these are as guilty
as those against whom indictments have been

report that" we found a number : of ; these ut
terly Illiterate and lacking ordinary Intelligence,
unable to give. a better reason for favoring or
opposing - a , measure ' than a desire - to , act .with
the majority. In some no-trace, of mentality
or; morality could be found; tin Â¦'others- 1 a '.low
order of training : appeared, united " with base
cunning, groveling instincts and sordid desires.
These; men,' through their corrupt agent, ap
proach the. legislative representatives of power
ful combinations or corporations competing for
valuable - franchises, . demand â¢ and ' receive of
them sums . of money â¢ ranging from . $100 to
$100,000 for their individual votes and Influ
ence.
Payments to Officials.
> From the evidence before us it appears that
an official of the city government boasted of the
fact that he had made $25,000 a year out of his
official position which paid a legitimate .sal
ary of but $300 a year. Â¦* Another official, ac
cording to evidence before us, agreed with one
Interest to do an official act for $75,000, and
afterward from the opposing Interests accepted
the sum of $100,000 for doing tha very, opposite
of that which he had agreed. to do for $75,000.
One legislator received in cash at his Own resi
dence, the sum of $50,000 for his vote on a pend
ing, measure.,- This was retained by him for. a
few- days ' and ; then returned in Â¦ the V hope .' of
receiving a larger sum. ; The measure was en
acted and' the member. ; after much delay,' -waa
. finally compelled to accept $500 in full for ; his
vote on the franchise. bill.-. . â¢ , ;-,; ; ;
Convincing documentary evidence â¢ was un
earthed ' proving, that Â¦ the , sum ' of $145,000 waa
placed, in escrow in, a bank In thla city to.be
paid to the. members of the Municipal.Assem
bly of St. Louts upon the passage of a valuable
franchise ordinance. This ordinance failed, and
a second bill was Introduced, upon the passage
of which the sum of about $2j50,0OO was distrib
uted among those members. . After the passage
of this ordinance the franchise was sold for one
million two hundred ; and .fifty- thousand \ dol
lars.'-; The cjty realized . nothing whatever for
this franchise. .: In these matters the statute of
limitation was . a bar to 'Â¦ the finding of indict
ments against nearly all of the guilty parties.
The more recent attempt of a street railway,
company < to ' secure I a Â¦ franchise has been con
spicuously brought - to public notice Â¦ through
proceedings ; In- the s criminal â¢ courts. In this
case an agreement was made between, the leg
islative agents of the. company and the repre
sentatives Â¦ of â¢ the . combines In both' branches'
of the Municipal r Assembly by the terms .of
which $75,000 was to be paid .to certain mem
ber-. 1 of the House of Delegates and | $60,000 to
certain members of the Council In consideration

A CHANGE TO SMILE.
PERHAPS there- was no legitimate
basis of hope that Richard Strauss,
with his "Enoch Arden." melodrama
j for voice and pianoforte, should suc-
â¢. .ceed where Schumann and other
great j men have notably, failed. - But one
never knows. There are always the Mar
conls of music to look out for, who reap
in strange fields, and -set ever wider the
boundary lines of the possible in art. But
Strauss has torn down no fences with
"Enoch Arden," the dictum is still "Thou
shalt not" so far as the melodrama' is
concerned, and the bastardy of the form
becomes even more apparent in spite, or
perhaps because, of the distinguished ge
nius of the composer, and the admirable
interpretative equipment of Mr*. Max
Heinrich and his daughter Julia, to whom
we owe our. introduction to the work. But
it is neither fish, flesh nor fowl., nor yet
good red herring, though the composition
still remains of strong interest from the
empiric standpoint.
Strauss has taken the Tennyson poem
in its entirety, some nine hundred lines. I
believe, and has set about a quarter of it
to music, with illustrative interludes. The
accompaniment is given to the pianoforte,
and the poem throughout is declaimed.
It was originally written for Ernst von
Possart, the celebrated German actor,
and Introduced a year ago in America by
David Bispham. .
Von Possart's interpretation seems to
hÂ»ve lent considerable weight to the work,
as Mr. Heinrlch's rendering of the other
evening persuaded to, momentary accept
ances of the form here, though it Is true
that the melodramatic form has always
'possessed a peculiar appeal for the Ger
man intellect. Strauss sins in very cood
company. . Schumann himself counts no
fewer than three melodramas, not reckon
ing in the "Manfred," viz., two Hebbel
ballads, "Schon Hedwlg," and "Ballads
vom Haideknabe"; and a Shelley lyric,
"Die Fluchtlinge." There are also several
j famous declamatory scenes in operatic litâ
; erature, as the dungeon scene in "Fide
| Ho," the "Egmont" dream scene; the in
\ cantation - scene frorh"'*Der Freischutz":
some passages . from "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," besides many others of
minor moment. , In fact the melodrama is
a problem that seems to have presented a
perennial attraction since its inception In
1774, by Georg Benda, and Strauss is but
the latest victim of its fascination. ;
Nor have the small fry escaped the con
tagion; from the ungodly recltress ; who
yav/ps a "Poem of Passion" to the satanic
Idiocy ' of an \ accompaniment of Lange's
"Flower Song," soft-pedaled Into lunacy
and its limp illiteracy otherwise glitter
lngly mangled, to the leading man who
Insists on orchestral chills and fever
while he whispers his tale of woe into the
ear of his female accomplice. : It Is a far
cry from > Strauss and ; Schumann to * the
aforesaid petty criminals, a planetary dis
tance'between their sins, but the principle
underlying.! their , performances , Is ,the
same,: the attempt .to weld Into one two
arts complete In themselves and mutually
antagonistic. | v
That < there are degrees of disaster per
taining to the attempt is of course evi
dent," and it is undeniable that Strausa has
his magnificent "moments In; "Enoch Ar
den,"" when one is almost persuaded that
a missing link: between music and the
drama has' .been discovered. But It Is
found that these moments occur chiefly
during the interludes; or when, with the
reader.: declamation becomes recitative,
when the peculiar viciou3ness of melo
drama, the lack of agreement in pitch
between the . spoken .word and the ac
companiment, ' Is lost sight of; or again
during ;a temporary sophistication of the
ear by the spell of the ; reader, - when the
accompaniment Is momentarily unnoticed.
But' the piano invariably, came as an im
pertinence after;: its sometime . silence. . so
also the,"readlng. after the roasiml inter
ludes, and Strauss, aided , by Max and
Miss Julia' Helrirlch, :; cannot succeed in
creating illusion, It is because there is no
illusion to '. create.

There are.tobeVexcursions through the valley and !to.the' mountains, picnics, banquets" arid: coii-'

REPORTS from ' San Jose are to the effect that the recent warm weather has rapidly
advanced the blossoming of the; trees and there is -now ample assurance that. nature will
do her part in decorating. the ; valleys and the foothills for the coming flower festival~:It
appears, therefore, that every prospect promises a cotnplete success for the .week of holi

In his eagerness to realize this dream of federation he became impatient of obstacles and
rushed into warjor the purpose of sweeping them put of his way. He failed. ; There, remains of
his dream nothing more than this foundation of scholarships, for American andiGerman students
at Oxford ;, . and the memory of his words, "What an awful . thought it is tha/t if even now we
could arrange with the political members of the" United States legislative: assembly and our House,
of Commons the peace of the world would be secure for all eternity."
In the light of the will; which transfers liisyast fortune not to his own family but to an
educational scheme for promoting a sense of racial unity and good will among the peoples of the
United States, Germany and the British empire, we can understand better many things in /Rhodes'
career which, in the. past have been misconstrued. His dream was that of accomplishing- a vast -
federal unity of the Teutonic races, if possible, and/ failing that, then a unity of the Â¦English-speak
ing peoples. He was for federation and not for imperial centralization. It follows therr'that his
imuch discussed donation v of$;o,ooo to the Parnell fund was not designed to obtain Irish votes
for his South African plans, butfor the purpose of advancing the establishment of a federal sys
tem of government, among the British islands asa step toward the larger federation of the empire
and eventually of the. empire; with the American republic. > â¢ *^ ~ -
CECIL RHODES' will discloses a trait in his character 'which the world could not recog
. nize during. his'. stormy and aggressive lifetime. This domineering, grasping and: seem
ingly; practical' man was - after .'all one of the world's greatest- dreamers. Not since
Napoleon hurried to ruin in pursuit of a phantom empire of United Europe has any
largely successful, man with an easy mastery over the material things of. life been haunted and in
fluenced by so vast a dream as that which illumined but at the same time deceived the riiind of the
would-be empire-builder of South Africa.

CLEVER ENGLISH ACTOR
WHO .WILL PLAY HERE IN
"THE CARDINAL." \ /
TO-MORROW evening at the Co
lumbia Theater E. S. Willard, the
genial English actor, will intro
duce a new play by Louis M. Par
ker, entitled "The Cardinal." A
" recent number of The Theater"â a theat
rical magazine that won't wash clothes,
but does everything else for the profes
sion"âhas something to say of Mr. Wil
lard's new play, that to the play-maker
may be interesting, and is at least amus
nig to the play-goer. De Wagstaffe, who
is doing interviews fcr The Theater, had a
talk with Mr. Willard, in which the sub
ject of the everlasting new. play hunt
came up. Mr. De Wagstaffe asks "How
are good plays to be found?" Mr. Willard
replying in the following fashion:
"I can speak only from my own ex
perience. For instance, about 'The Car
" dinar that I am doing now. My friend,
Louis M. Parker (the author), was in
such a desperate state of mind before lie
wrote It to'finda subject for a play that
I think his condition preyed upon me un
til I felt .it to be a personal responsi
bility. He would . come' to | my house, de
jected, fretting, his whole creative ma
chinery in check. He wanted to write a
play; there was a dramatic composition
.iix,isfs system actitng for.-an outlet, but it
eluded him. He -could not give it shape,
form, and In short, he was getting quite
moody and ill, with the weight of an un
written play on his mind.. , , '.Â¦;-,-![
. "I am very fond of Parker; he's a most
companionable chap â speaks half a dozen
languages, by the way, that leads him
Into all sorts of . embarrassing transla
tions, and is a scholar and a good fellow.
After awhile I realized that if some one
did not give Parker a subject for a play
well, there's no knowing what would hap
pen to him. Then I came across an old
poem of Charles Lever, with a dramatic
story that told of a confession made to a
priest by a murderer and the subsequent
accusation of the priest's brother of the
came crime. The story turned upon the
violation of the seal of the confessional.
The next time Parker turned up I read the
poem to him. He was fascinated with
the subject and suggested that we should
transfer the story to Italy and put the
lime back to some remote century of
splendor. This we agreed upon, and he
set to work. It was really a treat to see
him getting better and cheerful again.
"The priest of Lever's poem became Gio
vanni dl Medici, a cardinal, son of Lo
renzo the Magnificent, who was Pope at
the age of 36. Of course, we had to In
quire into many tacts of the Roman
Catholic religion to substantiate the story-
"For Instance. Would a Cardinal hear
confession? We were told that he would
be compelled to if It were demanded of
him, although It was unusual. Then came
the most Important .question. Would a
priest ever break the seal of the confes
sional? Never! Such a thing had never
been known' to happen In the whole his
tory, of the Roman Catholic church.
Priests tad changed their, faith, become
Protestants, but had 'never revealed the
secrets of the confessional, i Would a
priest use outside influences to entrap a
murderer, for example. Into a confession
under the canon law of the community?
Of the Heinrlchs'.song singing it is suf
ficient to say that Max Heinrich has lost
but -little voice and none of the fine heart
and fiber of his work. He sing3 with
every thread of. him,, with a careless,
jovial Franz Hate sort of strength thac
makes his German lleder quite Irresistible.
Miss Julia's voice is all and more than
it promised to be. . A. full, round, pure
contralto of delightful timbre and per
vaded with temperament it is. and Miss
Heinrich i3 already a singer to be re
membered, though she has by no means
reached the limit of her power. She sings
with excellent taste and has moreover an
unusually attractive personality.
I liked immensely the Strauss accom
paniment and" badly wanted that dear Mr.
Heinrich to shut up â most humble apolo
giesâthat I might listen to itâ when 1
was not wishing the piano at Jericho
that I could harken comfortably to him.
In spite of the Man Who Knows, who,
tells me it is all "enharmonic trickery"
and "harmonic monkey shines," that
every schoolboy puts benind:Hm with his
tops and marbles, I must ownYto having
fallen* strongly under the Strauss sway.
It is bigr. bold music, eminently pictur
esque, strpngly Individual, yet with a dis
tfner "Wagrnerian flavor (where Liszt
touches Wagner, my skeptical ' friend
says).-It Is very free in form, and to me

reader's art. He has a voleÂ© that holds
every note of sympathy and has an exact
and delicate dramatic appreciation that

Tennyson story with certain charm. MI33
Heinrlch's accompaniment was ever so
well played, rythmfcally In nicest ac
cord, but not infrequently a shade, some
times several shades, too Icudly.
THE -WELL-KNOWN COMPOSER
OF THE MUSICAL MELODRAMA,
"ENOCH ARDEN."
Under the strain of his responsibilities and the burden of his work the good man, the
faithful official, breaks down. Surrounded by those who love him and who know him to have
been faithful and true, he lies upon his dying bed. His grief-stricken family cluster around him
to minister to him as his noble life passes serenely away. Into that scene, whose solemn dignity is
sanctified by the approach of death, the clerical sniveler sneaksj his way by stratagem in violation
of the. wishes \ of - those who are nearest and dearest to the dying man. . There he begins to
make a theatrical play of repentance, weeping, whining, sniveling for forgiveness.
: Such scenes produce in the minds of decent people a sense of anger and disgust, but the
sniveler does not mind what decent people feel* Over the bed of death he* pours his worthless
tears and with many sobs and groans utters his debased prayer for pardon. Biit all the sniveling
is done in private and for the benefit of the sniveler himself. He never has the manhood to con- â¢
fess in public that he had wronged the .dead, that he had maligned and belied his benefactor, and
that the man whom he had hounded day after day and against whom he had aroused,, every,, evil ,
passion that stirs in the vile \yas after- all ah honest- many a friend' of the people \and a
'faithful officer. - r- . Â¦
One frank word uttered in public in honest acknowledgment of. wrong done to ..the dead
would be. but a slight atonement for the many thousands of vile words uttered in public by which
the wrong had been done, but not even that one word will the sniveler give as proof of a genuine
repentance. He leaves the victim's reputation to be fouled by the mobs arid by the repetition oi the
slanders he himself first uttered, whjle with a parasite's low cunning he seeks to get once more
back to the bounties of the dead man's family.
Such. are the manners and the. morals of the clerical sniveler," and by the. commission of
'". such offenses does he make himself known. , " Â¦ . ; >
In this emergency the official," respecting his. public office as well as his personal char
acter, stands steadfastly for law. He-announces his resolve to maintain, order and preserve the
peace; and^by his actions fulfills his words. The vainglorious cleric, tturned demagogue and half
hysterical with excitement, joins the gang of mob orators, and, finding trfot his -patron and bene
factor will not deviate from duty, turns upon him all the loose billingsgate of his vocabulary. He
rages, he raves and he rants. He denounces the good man as a tool of greedy plutocrats, .an op
pressor of the poor, an enemy of labor, a traitor to his race, a violator of his oath of office, a
brutal, vulgar, domineering, vindictive, purse-proud combination of fool, blackguard and tyrant.
By the violence of his vituperation, with its mingled falsehoods and scriptural texts gar
bled from Holy Writ and distorted from their. true meaning, the "vindictive cleric succeeds in
arousing among the unreflecting a bitter hatred of the official who has all his life been a friend to
every deserving man and a steadfast exponent of the doctrine of malice toward none, and charity
for all.-; . ' /: ' '"C.; s "^--"' ' ; / '-,/â¢,' : . /.:': 'â¢ -\i
k MONG the most offensive parasites that fasten themselves upon the churcji is the
. /\ clerical sniveler. The species is well known arid hardly needs description. Its peculiar
/ \ characteristic : is that J in loose-tbngued malevolence it makes virulent " attacks upon some
T unoffending person, and then later on repents and seeks forgiveness by sniveling; pour
ing forth tears about as profusely and as basely as it poured forth lies. ':Â¦Â¦.-: ; --
- The history of one clerical sniveler differs from that of another only in minor details.; The
trend of all of them is , very much the same. Given a young cleric. of sniveling characteristics. and
it will be very easy to forecast how he^ would act under any given circumstances.
Suppose a case of this kind A young cleric of an emotional- nature/ but lacking in moral
earnestness, .with an almost hysterical- readiness to rage or to weep, as occasion prompts, goes as
a stranger to assume clerical duties in a city where he is cordially, welcomed by a; man of high
character, noble life, arid wide influence. Delighted at the recognition of such a man, and warm
ing himself in the glow of so generous and so rich a nature, the cleric attaches Himself to the
good man as to a patron, feeds at his table, solicits his counsel, begs his favors, accepts his help
and shows his gratitude in a profusion of words; arid by all the fawnings of a false and shallow
Jp the course of events the man who has opened his heart, his hand and his home to the
cleric is called from the business and the retirement of private life to serve- his city in an official
..capacity., .He renders the service faithfully and efficiently/ In the. meantime the cleric, finding his
perfervid oratory has brought. hirn much praise; develops into a demagogue and learns to, delight
in the applause of the rabble. Then arises a crisis in the affairs of the city.- The people are
divided. Discontented /men gather in crowds, the most reckless of tongue force their way to the
front and begin to excite antagonisms and to urge bolder spirits to 'lawlessness and violence.
Public peace is disturbed/ riots are. threatened, assaults become numerous arid property and life

Cooper's report, is brief .'and expresses
general opposition to the bill. '
WASHINGTON, April 5.-Three sepa
rate minority reports on the Cuban reci
procity bill were filed to-day by Repre
sentative Robertson of Louisiana. New
lands of Nevada and Cooper of Texas, all
Democrats. Robertson says in parf -
'.'The bill if enacted. Into law would af
ford no relief to the Cuban treasury I
believe that the benefits would go into
the pockets of a few sugar planters own-
Ing thousands of acres of land. The 20
per cent reduction would hot go to the
relief of th^e Cuban people, but would go
immediately and entirely to fill the al
ready overflowing coffers of the sugar re
fineries of the United States, known by
the name of the sugar trust."
Robertson expresses astonishment that
one of his Democratic associates (Mc-
Clellan) In his report refers to the bill
as an enunciation of "Democratic doctrine
of reciprocity." Robertson adds: "It
seems to me'that that kind of reciprocity
Is absolutely Impossible under a Demo
cratic tariff. Should the tariff ever, be
revised on the line and plane of the prin
ciples of the Democratic party reciprocity
would ' be entirely unnecessary and im
possible, as the rates would not be pro
hibitive, and the extension of our trade
would as a natural consequence flow from
the imposition of such tariff rates with
out the necessity of reciprocity."/
Newlands makes an elaborate presenta
tion, reviewing the political and commer
cial phases. In conclusion he says:
"The American people are becoming
tired of sentimental legislation. We have
spent 5300,000,000 . in a' .war to free Cuba.
We have spent $500,000,000 in' attempting
to carry civilization to the Philippines. It
is now proposed by the . sentimentalists
that we should . inaugurate legislation
changing our finance' system, . not for the
benefit of the American , consumers, - nor
for the benefit of our agricultural classes,
which have thus far received little of the
benefit of our financial legislation, but for

planters, in order to relieve their threat
ened economic distress, a very large
amount of money.

SAN, JOSE, April 5.â An action against
the Modern ..Woodmen ot the World was
begun here torday to recover upon a ben
eficiary '-certificate. > for Â« ?20QO, â¢ issued to Dr.
R.*'H.-' Burke in March, 1900,-. and" niade
payable to his legal heirs.*...* Dr.* Burke died
in October, 1901, and bequeathed all his
property, including the' certificate, to his
wife, Alice S. Burke. The secret order re
fused payment on .the 'ground that the Il
linois law, under which It was organized,
does not recognize a will and that other
heirs may claim a- share.
Suit Against Woodmen Lodge.
Everything pointed to a , happy union.
But the love that lived through years of
separation could not stand the many
trials of matrimony and now Byrne and
the lady from Marysville are free- once
more to go their respective ways.* -
All through her marital, troubles the
young wife had the silent sympathy j of
Callaghan Byrne, who had long before
realized that his first love was his only
one. Finally, after long years of separa
tion, Byrne and I Hope Ellis Sherwood
met at Governor Gage's Inaugural ball.
It was not long before the estranged pair
were recalling old memories and the re
newal of the old ties followed easily and
naturally. VOn Â¦ January 29, 1899, the en
gagement was announced and two weeks
later, on Mardl ' Gras, the ' wedding was
solemnized in the presence of but. a few
intimate friends in the apartments of the
bride's father, W. T. Ellis, at the Palace
Hotel. v
--The knowledge of Miss . Ellis' wedding
to young Sherwood was a great surprise
to her ; many friends. She was to have
been one ' of the bridesmaids at the wed
ding of Miss Eleanor IDimond 'and Paul
Jarboe, but on ther very- day of the wed
ding Miss Dimond received a telegram
from Miss Ellis announcing; her marriage
to Sherwood and declaring her consequent
inability . to : serve her frlend.\ :
It. happened at Del Monte during: the
fashionable "shoot" period. . Miss Ellia In
those days . was ' addicted to decollete
gowns. Mr. Byrne objected to his fiancee's
wearing â¢ too little -; dress. ' The Â¦ couple
quarreled and the .betrothal was broken
off. Miss Ellis went back to her home in
Marysville 'and one \ day surprised her
friends by announcing her marriage to
Bert Sherwood, the divorced husband of
beautiful Miss Blethen. .., â¢ .-.: .
: On the 14th of February, 1899, Hope Ellis
Sherwood and Callaghan Byrne were mar
ried. The happy pair had faced matri
mony early: in '92, but a lovers' quarrel
brought the engagement at that period to
a sudden termination. . "'1,';
The Republicans of California who are
fighting the push machine, to save the
party fro'm dishonor and disaster will not
stand for organization tactics such as
Herrin and Burns employed in organizing
the late Republican Municipal Conven
tion in San Francisco. The - Republicans
favoring the nomination of a truly repre
sentative leader of the party will have a
candidate for chairman of the conven
tion. .That candidate is fairly named in
advance of the primaries-^the Hon'. Jacob
Hart Neff of Placer County. The Gage
lings in secret have selected George A.'
Knight, attorney of the State Board of
Health, as tneir candidate for chairman,
but ; they hesitate to come forward . and
name him. Their plan is to keep him in
, The Gage tnish in the Palace court de
fiantly assert that 'the Humboldt delega
tion will take orders from J.'C. Bull, and
that Bull is for Gage to a finish. The
counties . in the First Congressional Dis
trict other than Humboldt " County are
Del Norte, Slsklyou, Trinity, Tehama,
Shasta, Modoc, Lassen, Plumas, Sierra,
Nevada, Placer, Eldorado, Amador, Cala
verag, 'Alpine, Mono, Maripoea â¢ and
Tuolumne. â¢ Most of these counties are
against, Gage. Â¦ and they do not take or
ders from Bull."
Will Not Stand Organization Tactjcs.
A The boast of the bosses that they, have
everything fixed in Humboldt County for
a Gage delegation may be premature.
Local reasons may, incline the delegates
to support George 'Knight for chairman
of the convention, , but the heroic attri
butes of Lieutenant Governor Neff will
claim appreciation in Humboldt. . The
friends of Gillette and Selvage, rival can
didates for the Congressional nomination
in the First District, will hot care to in
cur the displeasure of the mining coun
ties by opposing Neff for chairman. :
. Hender is vice 'president of the Tuol
umne Bank, an insurance agent and the
proprietor of the principal saloon in So
nora, Frank Street is- president of the
bank and is justly rated as one of the
leading men of the caunty. . He is known
to be opposed to the nomination of Gage.
Indications are that the Tuolumne Coun
ty delegates will; stand by Uncle Jake
Neff for chairman of the Republican
State Convention, and Yosemite Commis
sioner Hender may feel constrained to
fall into line. v . l ,
Street, Is Opposed to Gage.
.The appointment of Thomas Hender of
Sonoma to the Tosemite .Valley. Commia
sion will not cause - the delivery of the
Tuolumne County delegation to Gage.
Frank Street and "other progressive Re
publican citizens of the county ' clearly
comprehend' the political situation. Hen
der stands well In Tuolumne County .and
has many friends in that' region; His
friends do not blame him for his loyalty
to Gage. They remark: "It is all right
for Tom Hender to be, for Gage, but if
Frank Street and other Republicans who
are openly opposed to the renomination of
Gage want to go to the State convention
Hender cannot stop Tuolumne County
from sending them there."
The district is counted as safely Repub
lican. In 1893 E. B. Edson, thÂ« Republi
can nominee, secured 42,106 votes against
38,121 for his Democratic opponent, H. M.
Larue.
"W. L. Crooks. Benicia; R. D. Robbins,
Suisun; Alexander Irwin. Marys vllle, and
Douglas S. Cone, Red Bluff, are Republi
can candidates for' nomination to the of
fice ' of 1 Railroad Commissioner for the
First District. . The candidacy of the last
named is reported in the following dis
patch from' Shasta County:
t 'REDDING, ; April. 4.â Douglas S. Cone,'
farmer, stock-raiser, banker and capital
ist of Red Bluff, while | in this city last

MABYSVILL.E, April 5.â Mrs. Hope
Ellis Byrne was this ' afternoon " granted a
divorce from Callaghan- Byrne, the well
known mining man, on the ground of de
sertion. The defendant- made no contest
and it is understood that' there was an
agreement between him and his wife that
he .would not oppose, her application for a
separation 'on . the ground . alleged. -No
alimony, or costs of suit were demanded.
The only issue of their marriage, a child
of two and a half years, was awarded to
the mother, the father to have charge of
the little one at stated intervals. "When
the child reaches the age of 5 years both
parents - will become ita custodians on
equal terms, the | time of their possession
of the youngster to be impartially divided.
Mr. Byrne will provide for the child's
maintenance ' permanently. :

One of his employers in .'speaking of

he -was one of my, own sons.".
For â¢, the past twenty-seven years
Shaughnessy had been a traveling rep

he had the reputation of being one of the
highest salaried traveling men in Amer
ica. His territory included Alaska, Wash

with a liberal hand and also gave it away.
It is said that upon 1 his retprn to thecity
after a trip people who were in hard luck
would wait for him near his. .business
office. After hearing" their * stories he
would press a ten or twenty ' dollar gold
piece in the' hand of each of them, arid
laughingly skip away. He refused no one.

urgent that, . rather than to wait and depenc
upon the uncertainty of a bond issue, it is th<
! sense of this meeting that the . honorable . thi
Board of - Supervisors of this city and county,
in, the making .us of the budget, . unanimously
raise as an urgent necessity an extra 1(
cents on each $100 valuation for the purchase
of . school sites wherever needed, and for thÂ«
erection of modern school buildings thereon.
j ' F. Morton secured the passage of the
following preamble and. resolution:

[jfcThe plan of advertising 'the northern
and central sections of the State. was ad

"Resolved, That the Municipal League heart
,ily indorses and encourages the .present move

Matters of local . Interest .were consid
ered at a meeting of the Municipal League
held last night at their headquarters. Th<
following resolutions introduced by" Dr
C. D. Salfleld were adopted: '
I. W. Hellman Jr.; who has been very
busy for several weeks locally financing
the Market-street " Railway, deal,' left yes
terday afternoon with his wife and a
party of friends in a private car for an
extended tour of Southern California.
It is the intention of the United Rail
roads to issue bonds to the amount i of
$35,275,000. For the purpose of authorizing
the issue a meeting of the stockholders
has been called for June 5. ,The object, of
the issue is to provide for the cost and in
debtedness of the various lines of the
system. The bonds are Â¦ to run twenty
five years and bear 4 per Â¦ cent interest.
The appointment of director is more an
honor than a reward in a pecuniary
sense. A director receives but 510 for
every meeting he attends. There are
about two meetings a month.
. The appointment of James M. Duane is
also a surprise. It was thought that as
soon as the deal went through Mr. Duane
would return to New York. It Is now
given out; however, that he will not make
San Francisco his permanent home, but
that he will be a constant visitor to this
city.
The new directors were all selected by
Attorney "Atterbury of New York,, who is
the legal representative of the Baltimore
syndicate. He has been here for several
weeks, and during that time he has not
allowed the "grass -to- grow -under his- feet,
but has been circulating around the city
and Investigating the qualifications of trie
various men suggested for directors. .
Two of the board will represent Brown
Brothers of New* York. They are" Duane
and Holland. Two of the old Market
street Railway directors have also been
retained. They are I. W. Hellman and
Charles ffolbrook. "Williamson has In
vested a large amount In , the new com
pany and is connected with the. firm of
Balfour & .Guthrie. Antoine Borel has
also invested a large amount in the new
company. He. was connected with the
North Pacific Coast Railway before it
sold out to the North Shore road. Joseph
S. Tobln as a director is somewhat of a
surprise, but his appointment is a popu
lar choice. Brown is cashier of the Cali
fornia Bank.
The names of those who will constitute
the new board of directors of the United
Railroads ; of San Francisco were officially
announced yesterday. They are James M.
Duane, Arthur Holland, Charles. Hol
brook, I. W. Hellman. Alexander B.-Wil
liamson, Joseph S. Tobin, Thomas Brown
and. Antdine Borel. There are to be nine
directors. The ninth director has not yet
been decided upon; however..

The train bearing the body of Cecil
Rhodes, which left Cape Town on Thurs
day, arrived here to-day on its way to
Buluwayo, Matabeleland. The town was
In mourning and practically the entire
population marched in the procession past
the funeral car.
"In offering Americans and Germans in
due sments to go to Oxford, Rhodes had
a dual aim. First, putting the youth of
England in intimate touch with what he
termed the two most progressive nations
of the world, so that they might be
broadened and spurred to more strenuous
efforts; second, bringing the best speci
mens of Americans and Germans oh such
terms with the English people and cus
toms that they might become missionaries
of a better international understanding."
When the trustees can meet and ail the
preliminary details are settled, a request
will be made to several prominent Ameri
cans to form a committee to act In con-
Junction with the English body and as
sume certain . responsibilities, for which
the executors are palpably unfitted," 'both
by absence from the United States and
Ignorance of its "customs. " ; - -"
LONTK5N. April 5â The war In SoutH
Africa, politics and every topic usually o r
interest were forgotten to-day in the ab
sorbing discussion of Cecil Rhodes" will.
Regarding that extraordinary document,
some new facts have been ascertained.
The total of Rhodes* fortune is likely
to prove to be Â£5,000.003. or slightly under
that amount. The executors are JLord
Roscbcry, Earl Grey. Lord Milncr Alfred
Beit. Dr. Janeson, L. L. MIcell and B. A,
Hawksley, to vrhozn he bequeathed the
residue of his estate. They \rill divide
about Â£1,000,000 or Â£1.500.009 among them.
According to the terms of this legacy
the amount is to be divided during their
lifetime, but as each j legatee dies his
Ehs|e gees to a commejn fund until : the
surviving legatee becomes Its sole owner.
â¢Hence, one of the executors, the majority
of *rham are already enormously -wealthy,
vrill cne day inherit -what will then have
probably accumulated into nearly Â£2,000,
000. Ttie executors have unusually full
powers, and can construe and add to the
Â¦will as seems fit. Hence, the omission of
British Columbia, Nova Scotia and other
Canadian provinces from the list of schol
arships is quite likely to be corrected and
each province of Canada may be put on
the rcme footing as the American States.
One cf Rhodes' most intimate associates
cald to-day:
"He drew up his will in the same spirit
in which he approached all great under
takings. In his most Important tasks he
merely sketched the outlines and left us
to 111 in the details. His trustees arÂ«
given plenary powers. In the matter of
the scholarships, Rhodes saw the scheme
**as so vast that any attempt to too rap-
Idly lay down the linÂ«5 might result In
harm, so, beyond endeavoring to meet
the legal requirements, he tried to leave
the fulfillment of his plans to those with
whom, during his lifetime, he had fre
quently discussed them."

The Food Was Grape-Nuts.
_____ \ . .
It helps one to know the kind of food
to select if they can learn the experiences
others have had.
"I consider it my duty to let you know
what Grape-Nuts Food has done for me.
I was suffering from dyspepsia and daily
Btomach trouble. After taking " many
kinds cf medicines without finding relief
I saw a. description of Grape-Nuts Break-
fast Food and began using It regularly,
and in loss than two weeks my indiges-
tion v.-as entirely gone. '
"Wlrcn I began using the food I weighed
135 pounds, I now weigh ICO pounds and
fed stronger than I have ever felt before.
Thanks and praise to the makers of
Grape-Nuts." Name and address given

Lutzen, in reporting, the robbery to Offi
cer O'Connell, said he was satisfied, the
handkerchief that Was stuffed into his
mouth was : saturated with chloroform, as
he felt an overpowering smell just before
he became unconscious. He ..was very
sick for some hours afterward.
O'Conneir made ;an' investigation, but
could find no one in the neighborhood
who - f saw or heard of the robbery. 'Â¦ Cap
tain Seymour does .not place niuch cred
ence in Lutzen's storjv but detailed.De
tectives Graham and Fitzgerald to : make

of one of__the most .remarkable .and.dar
ing robberies on Â¦ record, if Â¦ he ; is telling

hiÂ§_^story. .
LiUtzen reported to Policeman. G. P.
O'Connell about S o'clock, Friday night
that while he was fdellverlng milk on Zee
place. oft.Folsom street; between. Fremont
and Beale; two- men^ grabbed from

one of the men stuffed a handkerchief
Into his mouth and he became \ uncon-,
scious. Some'time. later he ; was found in
a woodshed about twelve feet .from 1 where
he says , the men grabbed hlmi by some
people, who roused" him to consciousness.
He; then discovered that the â¢'robbers had
taken $30 from his pockets. His team was

* A bitter fisht Is being made by the par
tisans of both parties, but those con
versant with the situation declare that
the first named ticket is a sure winner.'
Nevertheless no effort Is being snared to
render the victory a decisive one.
The Independent ticket, the candidates
of which are pledged to low license, is
made urÂ» as follows:
Tiustees â F. Blair Turpln, " Alfred VT. Bush,
Aionzo Coffin. J. R. AVood, Georgre Hark Sr.
Town Clerk â S. K. Roberts. Marshal â Captain
M Staples. Treasurer â A. L. House. â¢ â¢
The Citizens' and Taxpayers' party
elected Its candidates two years ago. and
a high license tax . of Â£759 was imposed
upon all saloons. The result was the clos
ing of the more undesirable places, where
the tough element gathered on Sundays.
and the creation of a oitter sentiment
against the reform element. Several pro
prietors of saloons who were arrested lasf
summer for selling liouor without a li
cense recently effected a combination Â¦with
some disgruntled partisans and not a fcV
of the more respectable German element
who favor a low license and â¢have put - a
ticket in the field. J2ach pexty has its
support In the shape of a town newspaper
and the situation is becoming interesting.'
The Citizens' and Taxpayers' ticket Is
as follows: ;
Mill Valley is in the throes of a political
campaign and there is considerable specu
lation as to the identity of the five Town
Trustees who will be elected on the 11th
inst. The issue lies between the element
opposed to the Sunday beer gardens and
that which favors a wide-open town.
Frincipal Issue Involved I Is
the Matter of Saloon
Licenses.

Liuis LutzsD, a Milkman,
Tells of a Thrilling
Experience.
From Acapulco she went to . Callao arid
from there to Valparaiso, where the offi
cers were royally entertained by the VaK
paraiso Club. President Riesco of Chile
Mas a guest -on board the battleship and
entertained the officers ashore..; Callao
was revisited February 11. .Here the Pres
ident of ' Peru and United States Minister
Dudley were entertained on board.
The #.VIsconsin arrived at Acapulco Feb
ruary'SC. After coaling at Pichilinque she
proceeded to Magdalena Bay, where for
ten days target practice was engaged in.
She arrived at San Diego March 25 and
left there April. 3. The Wisconsin goes
to the Union Iron Works to have the
travel stains removed and will probably
remain in this port for some time.
The ' Wisconsin left here June '19 for
Puget Sound, where; she remained until
October 14. On that date she sailed 'for
Pago Fago with Captain Myer, one of the
members of the Tilley. court-martial,^
aboard. From Pago Pago she went to Apia,
where Thomas ' P. Purdon, an' apprentice;
died from' the .effects : of drinking wood
alcohol.. He was burled at Apia.', trom
Apia the Wisconsin steamed Â¦ to Honolulu 1
and from there to Acapulcp. ' A few days
before reaching the latter port C. It. Fer
guson, an apprentice, fell overboard. A
lifeboat was sent after" him and he' was
picked up in the remarkably short tim<s
of three and one-half minutes. .
THET United States battleship .Wls
confein returned to port yesterday
afternoon -after an .'absence- of
over nine months, during which
; time she has visited Samoa,Â¦Hon
olulu and a Â¦ number * of South American
ports. , The Wisconsin's cruise has been
a continuous target" practice. Every. one
of her guns has been fired time and again.
They have -been fired at floating .targets'
and aimed at rocks. The record; of -* the
numerous, engagements with inanimate
foes shows that the- Wisconsin Is manned
by as good marksmen as ever trod a war
ship's deck. Captain Reiter is proud of
his .vessel and still prouder of the men
that man her. :" .-V'.

Men's Diseases j
I Treated S
With Certainty. I
TVTien I speak of my certain methods |j
of treating men's diseases I do not mean H
to Imply, that every case In existence |j
will yield to them." But I do mean H
that a majority Â«f* those. cases that I]
have been unskillfully treated and 1 1
that are supposed to be incurable, will a
yield promptly and completely to my. . Â¦
â¢ methods. I also mean that my accept- II
ance of a case for treatment Is assur- II
ance of a cure, for I will not under- |i
take a case unless a cure Is possible. |J
| Varicocele. i \
This most prevalent of all diseases of 1 1
men la also the most neslected. either I j
I through dread of the harsh methods of II
treatment commonly employed. or . f j
through Ignorance of the grave dangers Â¦
that accompany the disease. As varl- H
cocele Interferes directly with the clr- ||
culation and process of waste and re- r
pair.' throughout the generative organs, Q
the necessity of a prompt and thorough jl
cure cannot be too forcibly emphasized. H
I cure varieocsle In one week by an II
' absolutely painless process. My cures W
are thorough and absolutely permanent l|
and are . accomplished without the use II .
of 'knife, ligature or caustic. *j
Stricture. 1
A complete cure is accomplished \
.â¢without cutting or dilating. H
Contracted Disorders. I
To but partially cure a contracted a
disease ia almost as danserous as to al- t
low It to go untreated. Unless every Ej
particle of infection and inflammation 3 4
I Is removed the disease' will gradually M
work Its way into the general system. S3
; There is the danger of . the prostate H
gland becoming chronically - Inflamed, M
I which 'always brings partial or com- ii
plete loss of power. 25 per cent of the i
cases of so-callea . '/weakness' * are a I
1 direct result of some improperly treated tl
F : contracted disease. During . the past ffj
V five years . I have treated " over C50O fcj
fe cases of contracted dl&orders. and have t
I effected an absolute cure in each in- I
E stance. There have been no- relapses H
b or undesirable developments whatever. I-J
I " Weakness"
I In the treatment of those functional
I disorders known as "weakness" I have
E attained a degree of success tha* has
K placed me foremost among specialists
I in men's diseases. Ey careful treatment
I -I restore all the organs to their normal
I state, thus removing the cause of func-
F tional derangement and producing a
t complete and permanent cure. I will"

be accepted. The choice will depend upon
the success with which the. appeals for

such a department. The Ledge, published

not only for the large attendance and the live
ly interest taken in the proceedings,, but "also
lor tho business brought forward and the na

these was the position which the Government
sustains toward the mining industry and . the
extent to which that industry has been bene

Some. Idea of the immense savlntr to the
Mountain Copoer Company can be gained when
it is stated that electricity develops a horse
power of energy for one hour at an expense
of about three-quarters of a cent, where with
wood, coal or petroleum the hourly cost per
horsepower 'for fuel and attention was ' but
little les B than 4 cents, namely 3.6 cen^s. ;
What is going . to be done at this mine . In
Utah is . now being Â¦ successfully done with
some of the old gold mines in California, some
of which, long ago, were looked -upon -.as
"worked out." Â¦Â¦ Many of .". these mines were
abandoned, it being supposed that there was
no gold in paying quantity below the depth
they were worked, which probably in no in
etance exceeded 1000 feet. That would hold
true In cases of â¢ "gash" veins, but i with
"fissure", veins the paying depth has not yet
been reached. 1 It will in time be demonstrated
that in California, and in fact along the entire
Pacific Coast; â¢ taking the Rocky Mountains a3
the eastern boundary, that the vein formation
Is largely fissure In character, and that", the
depths yet attained are but - superficial, as
compared -with what mine working will be a
few years hence. Â¦' ' . â¢ ' - .
The Calaveras Prospect reports that the
development of the Greek mine,, near the
Banner mill, has begun. The old Central
Hill gravel mine*' near San .Andreas, has
been bonded.' Â¦<â¢â¢â¢Â¦ Â¦ Â¦- -.". Â¦
The Amador Ledger reports that-prep
arations are making to operate the Fre
mont'and Grover claims on a large scale,
and the works bid fair to be equal, If not
superior, td any in the county. .
The great plant of the Mountain Copper
Company . at Keswick, Shasta County, is
now operated' by electricity. The Redding
Free Press says that electricity has been
â¢used for some time on the slag- railroad
connected with the plant. Â¦< . - :
. As an instance of how differently, as com
pared with ten years ago, . to go no further
back, sinking to greater depths for the richer
ore bodies is regarded," the following may be
cited â It is but one of many: At the Cactus
mice .in Utah-it .has--.been. -decided to put the
shaft down to a depth of 2000 feet before
further exploring on the vein. , The shaft is
now down. C00 feet, but the owners, after In
vestigation and deliberation, have decided that
it-, will pay, them better to go to the greater
depth before attacking their ore bodies. - be
lieving that they will find the. ore -more uni
form ln value at the greater : depth, and as it
can be more economically worked by stoplng.
The Amador Record says that when the
mill has Its full complement of 100 stamps,'
the Gwin mine plant wiu be the finest on
the mother lode. The same journal says
that the chlorination works at Sutter
Creek, known as the Amador Reduction
Works, have been started up, \using' oil
for fuel. â¢
When the water was turned on In the
Melones mine at Melones, Calveras Coun
ty, everything went well. Nearly $1,000,
000 has been expended in : six years, t Sixty
stamps are now dropping and sixty more
will be put in soon. â¢
The Los Angeles Times, discussing deep
mining and new methods, says:
Improvements Are Large.
The Toulomne Independent reports that
San Francisco capitalists are bargaining
for the George Mapes . gravel mines ; at"
Yankee Hill. Thomas Brown has sold a
part of the Sunnyslde quartz mine, near
Five Mile Creek, to A; A/ Cline. 'Ernest
A. Wiltse has agreea to sell to Augusta
H. Ward of : Alameda-the Two Brothers
and the Little Sister quartz mines, near
Groveland, and also a milling site of five
acres at the head of Deer Creek. The
Peacemaker mine, near Arastraville, has
been sold by U. S. Green to Paul F. Green
of Sonoma. . Â¦ .
It begins to appear that . there will be a
boom in the resumption of gravel mining: In
this county. -At Springfield deposits of. great
richness have been discovered. C. L. Lang
Is operatins a claim at Mount : Brown. ' ban
Jose people are negotiating for seventeen acres
belonging to W. Mansfield, at Columbia. Don

The two duets of the afternoon were
Dvorak, and other numbers were by

Mr. Heinrich numbered three delightful
songs in his selections, "Die Meines
Herzens Kronelein," "Ach, Lieb. Ich Mus3
nun Scheiden" and "Ah, Woe is Me. Un
happy Man." In .which last his wonderful
faculty for "picturing" was in splendid
evidence. He also,gave a group of Schu
mann songs, explaining before it. in the
friendly fashion that lends the Heinrich
recitals their intimate charm, the dainty
little legend of the "Schneegloechen"â
"Snowdrops"â the subject of one of the
songs.
programme was the group of Richard
Strauss songs, or rather two groups, that
were given by the singers. Charming, in
deed, some of them turned out to be,
and all possessed a novel and agreeable
flavor. "Die Wasserrose"â "The Water
Lily"â Is a particular bit of loveliness
that Is sure to find its way into many
programmes. It suited Miss Heinrich ad
mirably and was accepted with notable
â¢warmth by the audience. Another of the
group sung by Miss Heinrich to win Im
mediate way was the "All Meine Gedan
ken Mein Herz und Mein Sinn."
The feature of the yesterday afternoon
The Heinrich programmes grow in in
terest, and the one for yesterday after
noon's recital at Sherman & Clay Hall
was simply delightful. No lover of good
song singing, .more particularly of the
German liefier. can afford to miss these
recitals, and it is good to know that two
extra performances will be given next
week at popular prices. The extra recitals
are set for Wednesday evening and Sat
urday afternoon next, at Metropolitan
Hall, and a number of new things in song
literature are promised.

TOO STRENUOUS
Hence Mrs. Bickerstaff
Commences Action
for. Divorce.
Says Her " Spouse ' Juggles
With Bad Words and
Coffee Pota
A coffee pot, a knife and bad language
figure ln great variety in the suit for di
vorce filed by Minnie Bickerstaff against
Joseph Bickerstaff yesterday. According
to the complaint, Bickerstaff is a past
master in the use of billingsgate. Mrs.
Bickerstaff charges that her husband's
language is too bad "even for a divorce
complaint." She alleges that his words
are vile, indecent and opprobrious." - . '--/
"The coffee pot incident referred to by
Mrs. Bickerstaff, she alleges, occurred oli
the night of December 14 of last- year.
"He took the coffee pot," alleges . Mrs.'
Bickerstaff, "and threatened to throw it
at me, but was restrained by the plead
ings of his children, of whom there are
seven." . ,
Mrs. Bickerstaff alleges that she | left
her husband after the coffee pot incident
and remained away from him until he
promised to reform,, when she again re^
sumed her relations with him. But he
did not keep his promise, she alleges, for
he again resumed his cruel conduct. ;'. \
He took a knife, she alleges, a short
time after her return to l}er home, held
it at her throat and threatened to kill her.
The Bickerstaffs, who were married in
1882, reside on Folsom street. Mr. Bick
erstaff, alleges his wife, is a strong,' able
bodied man, earning $4 per day. She asks
for a reasonable sum. as. alimony and the
custody of the children.
Alphonsle Batteate Is suing Antone Bat
teate for divorce for failure to provide.
They were married in 1892 and have three
children, who have beenfor the last year
Inmates of .the San Francisco Children's
Orphanage on Sanchez street. Mrs. Bat
teate alleges that she has had to depend
upon her own exertions and the charity
of friends for her support for the last
three years.
Mary Wood filed an action for divorce
on the ground of desertion against Wil
liam M. Wood yesterday. She alleges that
he deserted her more than a year ago.
They were married in Sonoma County ln
1873, and have several children, all of

RATHER ROTVT ANTIC ESCAPE. Y
FROM A JAIL IN OREGON
Love Prompts a "Woman. Prisoner to
Burglars.
Unlock the Cell Door of
Thomas Featherstone and Michael M.
Reed, who escaped from jail at Jackson
ville, Or., and were recaptured at" Eu
reka, Humboldt County, were brought to
the City Prison yesterday by Deputy
Sheriff H. G. McCarthy of Jackson Coun
ty, Or., who will take them back to Jack
sonville.
Featherstone and Reed were arrested
for robbing a farmhouse . near Jackson
ville, and while in jail became acquainted
with a Mrs. Martin, who was awaiting
trial for deserting her husband and elop
ing with another man. Mrs. Martin and
Featherstcne often met in the corridors
and she became infatuated .with him. She
was, allowed, considerable freedom and
planned to release Featherstone. One
night she abused the turnkey's confidence
and unlocked the door of the cell in
which Featherstone and Reed were con
fined. - They made their escape, and it is
suspected that Mrs. Martin supplied them
with money. She confessed to aiding
them to set away and said it was love
for Featherstone that prompted her to
help them out of jail.
A Market-Street Problem.
Gibson, the shirt man on Market street,
known as "your bosom friend," offers a
neat little example for those mathemati
cally inclined. Gibson weighs 120 pounds;
he claims that he may be- a lightweight
but that he can buy as close as the heav
ier buyers. Now, Gibson has expanded
and is twice as big. The problem is
whether he will still weigh 120 or will
double up to 240 pounds.
Seven Years for Bair.
UlysBes G. Balr, the prince of bad dol
lar manufacturers, was sentenced in the
United States District Court yesterday
by Judge de Haven to imprisonment in
the San Quentin Penitentiary for seven
years and to pay a fine of $1000. Bair's
dollara were the best imitations the secret
service men had ever seen, the only no
ticeable defect being a deficiency in
weight. â¢ ...
HOR a number of years efforts have'
been made to preserve the his
torical relics and landmarks of
California, and among the accom
plishments in this line most
worthy of mention are those of the Na
tive Sens in saving: to the State Sutters
Fort at- Sacramento and the old Custom
house at Monterey. The Native Daugh
ters have taken up the matter and at the
session of the last Grand Parlor adopted
the following by a unanimous vote:
Whereas. It is apparent that many historical
landmarks in the State of California are fail-
Ing into decay, suffering at the hands of van
dals or giving way to the march of "improve
inent'.'; and - â . â¢ ,. ....
Whereas, It is believed that many relics and
documents of historical value exist which are
held in light appreciation by their possessors;
and Â¦ Â¦ â¢ , Â¦Â¦:--.- Â¦Â¦Â¦'
Whereas. It is the sense of this Grand Parlor
that such landmarks, when practicable, should
be preserved and. their historical . value made
public, and I that the relics, documents and
other scattered articles of historical value
should be gathered together and preserved for
the. benefit of the State and. its people, and as
It is a Just and becoming task for a patriotic
organization like the Native Daughters of the
Golden West to Undertake the work' of search-
Ing for, preserving and perpetuating such land
marks and gathering together all such his
torical documents and relics as are .not al
ready set apart in the archives of the State
or in museums or other repositories accessible
to the public; therefore be It '
To Seek Information.
Resolved, That preliminary to the work of
such preservation and collection the grand
president is hereby authorized to appoint a gen
eral committee of not less than three, which
committee shall proceed at once, upon Its ap
pointment, to communicate with the subordi
nate parlors with a view to securins informa
tion concerning the location, character, owner

I vould have spoken but I thought you would

yem said you did not want me to bring any
more: in other words you did not wish to have
anything- more to do with me. . I am very sorry.
Miss Waldrop, for I. love you very dearly. You
have, heard stories that have turned you
against me, but you will see in days to come
I tninot what I am said to be. Give a per
ron a bad name and it is very. hard' to: get rid
of it. but I will get rid of mine Just, to show
peop!<- that I am not what they think. All I
have. to say for the landlady is that maybe by
the time the people set through with hervthat
ehe-has been blackmailing she will learn' to tell
the truth. She has parted me from my home,
turned my mother against hrr' own child an<l
parted me from you. that I thought the very
vorld of. I will make her pay dear for it. My
turp is yet to come to deal, with her and she
won't get off as easy as she thinks. I am not
the only one. The gentleman that she has been
talking about is doing, the main part of it. - It
is. now my turn to laugh at h-r. This gentle

rt VELYN MARS just adored
* 2^ actresses. In fact, she cen-
B ,v tered her adoration upon the
Kt "* bright particular stars of thy
B Â¦ Alcazar and the Central thea
Â¦^^Â¦^^ ters. Now she languishes in
the City Prison, with a pros
pect cf prosecution for "burglary because
she robbed the objects -of her affection in
order to buy huge bouquets â¢ for them.
She was arrested yesterday afternoon in
Miss Agnes Ranken's dressing room at
the Alcazar, where she took refuge when
the saw the detectives following her.
The girl confesses having stolen a seal
skin coat, three silk waists, an alarm
clock, part of a toilet set and two photo
graphs of Agnes Ranken from Miss An
nette Marshall's flat at 531 Golden Gate
avenue last Sunday night.: These were
all found in her room. She denies having,
stolen other articles, and with tears in
her eyes says she does not know .why she
commuted the crimeâ that it was the re
sult of a sudden impulse at a time when I
she needed money. --"'.T-
Miss Mars is ytmng. probably 20, tall
and statuesque. She is a. brunette, with
blue eyes as guileless as a fawn's, and
her face Is free from the marks of. crime
or dissipation. She has not yet been
charged with the crime, and she may es
cape punishment through . the tender
heartedness of the actresses from whose
dressing rooms she is supposed to", have
pilfered many trinkets of more or less
value. Annette Marshall, at the. Central.
declares she will not help to send the poor
girl to jail-that she only hopes it will be
a lesson to stage-struck girls who are not
willing to win their way by grit. "I
couldn't be so cruel," says Agnes Ranken.
"She's a woman," is Olga Waldrop's rea
son for not wanting to see her punished,
and Georgle Cooper puts her chin In the
air and ends the, matter with a decisive
"Not on your life."
HAUNTS THE THEATERS.
Evelyn Mars' name . probably, dragged
her irresistibly into the limelight belt.
Certain it Is that for two months she has
haunted the Central and" Alcazar, scarce
ly missing a performance at either/and
hastening from one to the other â¢ so ' that
she might not miss seeing any of the
actrefises 6he admired so much. Often
she was behind the scenes and ' in , the
dressing-rooms, , getting 1 past the dragons
that are set to keep chappies away by
saying that she had a message from Miss
Waldrop to Miss Ranken or the reverse.
Once past the barriers, she would rush to
a dressing-room with . a great bouquet . ot
violets or lilacs or American Beauty, roses.
She knew the maids and often confided to
them that she adored Miss Waldrop and
Miss Ranken. She I showered her." floral
tributes upon Miss Marshall and MIs3
Cooper as well, "and), kept them all in as
tonishment that a rather shabbily dressed
girl could afford to spend so much money
for flowers.' H : : : . .Â¦
AH of these actresses missed " articles
and money from their' dressing-rooms at
times. After the burglary of '; Miss ' Mar
shall's flat, suspicion; was directed to the
"flower girl," as Evelyn Mars. had come
to be known. Detectives Reynolds Â¦'Â¦ and
Dinon were put on. the case, and yester
day they searched a; '.room ; at ' 607 S Ellis
street, where the Mars girl had been liv
ing for two weeks, 1 and , found hidden in
her trunk: the- sealskin ,coat and; other
valuables which Annette Marshall # had
lost. Hurrying to the Alcazar, they found

The playground is to be open from 9 a.
m. to 3 p. m. to children under 6 years
of age, and from 3 to 6 p. m. to all school
children, whether in public or private
schools. .
The great center of attraction was the
"monkey cage." a framework that looks
like a skeleton gas works and is equipped
with enough ladders, bars, poles, rings
and other simple apparatus to entertain
several hundred boys. The surface be
neath is covered with tanbark as a safe
guard against mishap. Every corner of
the ground Is an BI Dorado for the 'boy
with an excess of animal splrtt^to -work
off. A section of the ground is inclosed
by a wire fence. Inside of which the girls
can play, safe from molestation.
The adults and the children who could
not withstand the allurements ot the band
listened to the speeches. The rest of them
were too busy with the swings and rings
and ladders to give thought to wbat was

instated on â¢ the -eligible, list, though the
teacher was . ori'e; of the 125 pedagogues
! dropped from t the" rolls In January, 1899.
School Director' Roncovleri admitted
that he knew very: little of the merits*' of
the case, but had accepted the arguments
of two of/-his, colleagues and had voted
for the reinstatement: .
School,Director Mark said that his vote
was based ona. legal proposition, and that
j he wanted justice done to the. teacher for
whom he^had 'voted. . ' ; ;
School Director-Denman positively says
that his colleagues'^were In error.. -He
voted against reinstatement on the'ground
that the teacher, in'. question had been
legally! dropped, from the department and
had no claim to be put back.
' DEFEND RECENT .VOTE.
The exclusive story published in The
Call yesterday that' some of the teachers
dismissed in January, .1899, had been, put
back in the : department without being
asked to take any examination caused a
considerable amount Of comment, in schol
astic and business circles. '.
Directors ".Woodward and Mark 'defend
their recent &vBte of reinstating a dls
;missed teacher: by saying; that the lady
Jn .'..question .had '.been elected a "regular
teacher" by^the^board of 1898 at; a'.meet-
Ingon Depeniber 28iof. that;ye&rÂ«V. . Â¦'Â¦ â¢;".;
?, twelve'; others^,'- 11 ,* said'
.Wodidward^and^Marli,- "were: elected. at- a"
regular 'meeting of trie Aboard,' and the
board 'of 189d had, no power to remove a
regularly elected. teacher."- *
When asked why other : teachers who
had been dismissed at thesame tiriie,were
not also entitled to be reinstated, the Di
rectors answered;that- the" elections mak
ing them regular, teachers j were "special
meetings, and -therefore .were illegal." >
The acts of the board of 1893 in electing
a big batch of regular teachers were so
notorious that its successor.; known as
the "Bergerot board," made a clean sweep
of the appointees by an /'omnibus resolu
tion," adopted -January 25, 1899. '
The question Is -being asked why the
present board : recently .voted to reinstate
one cf the teachers elected- in thÂ£ closing
days of the board of 1S98 and dropped a
few days .later., by resolution' and' yet
stoutly takes the attitude that more than
100 other teachers dismissed -at the same
time are not entitled to reinstatement. ,
POINT OF LAW IS CLEAR.
Although : each Board of Education has
formulated Its own plan of electing teach
ers, ell boards for many years have fol
lowed a stipulated mode of election.
It has been customary for:, boards - to
elect an applicant as a regular substitute
teacher. Then the applicant would have
to serve as a regular teacher' oh probation
before receiving final standing as a regu
lar teacher., â¢ Â¦ ,
'The State laws distinctly stipulate yiat
the probationary term shall not date from
the time the applicant "was appointed as a
substitute teacher, but from the day on
which the : teacher was assigned to ''Â¦Â¦ a
school as a resrular. teacher.
Directors Woodward and Mark showed
that they are, adepts rin splitting hairs
when asked to explain \ their - recent vote
of reinstating Miss ,. Dorothy F. Moran:
They both, Insisted that 'the young lady
was elected a regular teacher- December
28, 189,8, and that her removal a few days
lkter was not legal. The Directors also
apply; the same reasoning to , the teachers
who were elected that day and dismissed
later/.- ,.. Â¦ ' ,.'â¢â¢Â¦ . Â¦ ./â¢
,The f one hundred and more teachers
dropped from the department in January,
1Â£99,. took their ; case Into the courts. A
decision was | rendered -.that they -had no
claim , to I be reinstated because I they had
not | served for a probationary - term' f ol-.
lowing their, election as regular teachers.
N0T{ ON PROBATION.
â¢This 'decision applies exactly : to the
teachers I elected December " 28, : 1S98, and
dismissed thecnext, month., ; They did' not
serve ; f or ; a ; probationary term following
their,; election, having | no V opportunity . to
do so, yet Directors Woodward : and Mark
claim that,thls batch (Ot teachers ; have
the" legal ,right to be \ reinstated; â¢ arid 5 in
some cases have taken s uch s teps. â¢".' Â¦ /â¢ *
Director Roncovieri said' yesterday that
If any. of the teachers . who had been dis
missed ; would .come j before the board and
show that they, were legally, entitled to , be
reinstated that he would vote on that' line.
.The . arguments ' put forward by Wood-,

Major Pope Leaves Insurance.
Saxton Temple Pope, son of the late
Major and Mrs. B. F. Pope, filed a peti
tion for special letters of administration
upon the estate of his mother yesterday.
The estate, he avers In his petition, does
not exceed In value $16,000. It. consists of
an interest in three life insurance poli
cies on the life of Major Pope.- who died
in Manila recently. ;wo of the policies
are for $6000 each and one Is for $3000. A3
Major Pope and his wife died intestate
the estate will go to the seven children of
the deceased. '\
Mr. J. B. Xei:i, for ten years head sales
man In the piano department of Sherman,
Ciay & Co.. has resigned to accept a posi
tion with the Wiley B. Allen Co., 931-933

all friends.
"Now, honey, go Into your own back
yard and keep on your own side of the
high board fence," sang Captain John F.
Anderson, captain of the dock of the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company about mid
night of Friday. Captain Anderson, with
the aid of a gang of stevedores, had pro
vided the "high board fence." behind
which his neighbor "might play." and
then invited all hands to go and have a
little supper.
While the captain was doing the honors
as generously as he coufd in a Mission
restaurant, a rumor reached him that his
next-door neighbor had been apprised of
his action and was gathering his cohorts
for an assault upon the newly erected
fence. The restaurant man was glad the
captain was in a hurry, because he left
the change on the counter, when paying
his score. Captain Anderson was soon to
the defense of his fence, and with a rifle
that has laid low many a seagull, stood
vratch over his creation on the nether side
of a Mission hill.
Captain Anderson has a handsome home
at 1062 Dolores street, between Twen
ty-third and Twenty-fourth. There
he spends his leisure hours and has made
it as comfortable as possible for his fam
ily. Some months ago M. Tarpey, a sa
loon-keeper, purchased a lot to the south
of the Anderson residence and proceeded
to erect a building thereon. Adjoining: the
Tarpey residence on the south is the resi
dence of Charles F. Stone, secretary of
the Bancroft-Whitney Company. Against
this building Tarpey has set his line
Â¦walls, eo as to exclude all light from the
Stone residence.
Between Tarpey's house and the Ander
son residence is a space of twelve feet. On
this side, either by accident or design, the
Â¦windows in the Tarpey house have been
so constructed that they overlook all the
living rooms of the Anderson family. An
derson claims that his privacy has been
violated, and as be does not want to have
his family subject to the annoyances of
the eyes of prying neighbors, he has'
Â«reeied a high board fence.
When Anderson's duty was completed
on Friday evening he got a crowd of his
men together, ordered a lot of rough lum
ber, and as soon as all had arrived, pro
ceeded to erect a fence.
"It tcok us only an hour and a. half ro
build that fence, and I guess no Mission
zephyr v.ill blow it down," said Captain
Anderson as he contemplated his night's
â¢work.
The fence covers the windows of the
Tarpey building and it effectually shu?s
our any view of the Anderson residence.
Captain Anderson has not as yet com
pleted the construction cf his fence, which
will eventually extend from one end of
the lot to the other. Even as it stands to
day. It completely shuts out the lignt
from one side of his neighbor's house,
v.'hile on the other there is no provision
made for lighting.
\L*t any man dare to touch that fence."
says Captain Anderson, "and see what he
will get." \ ! i;

The mile run proved one of the best
contests of the field day and furnished a
surprise In the shape of a dark- horse.'
This arduous run was won by De Mamiel
of Lowell High School, after a courageous
struggle with Weller of Uklah. The per
sistent manner In /which these, gritty
.young sprinters fought for victory won
helrty, cheers , from the small army of
rooters that crowded the bleachers to
pe3 the sport. There were twelve starters
in this event. De' Mamiel took the lead
.at 'the start and cut "out a fast clip. He
led the bunch until In the back stretch
.'of. the last lap, when Weller spurted up
even with him. Down "the back stretch
these two raced, cheered on ; by their
school mates.- When they reached the
.home stretch,' one hundred 'yards from
distance in , better, time. He .also v;on
first iplace In the hammer throw and In
the 120 hurdles. The latter event proved
one of. the prettiest, and. most, exciting
events' of the day. In Chaplln"the Ukiah
hurdler had a dangerous opponent. This
pair ran 'neck and neck for the greater
part of the course. It was only over the
last three hurdles that Weller made th6
go.In that wpn for him the face.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 5.â
-Â¦o'fyaXi Overall won the flrst game of the
intercollegiate baseball series for the UnJ
.verelty^or California this afternoon. With
hut., three, errors charged to each team.
.California's pitcher held the cardinal bat
.iers down to four hits. The score was 6 to
3. in. favor oC, the blue and gold,
i'-' The game was interesting and at times
[ exciting . from- the first inning to tha
ninth. The Stanford players fielded -well,
but. seemed wholly unable. to connect with
Overall's delivery. The big pitcher struck
out .seven men, passed but one man to
first, hit well and played an errorless
game, accepting six chances. Me Far land.
/who went into the box for Stanford, was
"hardly up to his formi. His twirling was
riot r: as steady as usual, which was shown
toyf the .fact that four men walked to
first. . In making assists, however, he was
cool, .and did. not make an error.
The one place in which Stanford's nine
excelled California's was behind the bat.
McGlIvray played in professional form.
His throwing to bases was the feature oC
the game.

Uncle Hank, with his face wreathed In
smiles, eat on the bench with his men as
of yore. He had his usual fatherly con

alert to put his new talent "wise" to
every move and trick resorted to by the
enemy. ...
"The affable Mike Fisher, who yearns to
become a magnate, performed on the vis

act and. also several minor stunts, ,but
Ills, "â¢cope" did not seem to be up to the
'standard of Uncles. Fisher's face plain

expression until the ninth inning, wh?n
his celts landed on the ball and rolled up
three taliies. Then his face lit up for. a
brief instant, only to be clouded again

Parade of the Players. â¢
Before the game the players and- man
agers rode through the streets in car
riages, headed by a brass band, just as
:-they -were wont to do 'years- ago. After
much parading through the central part
â¢of the city they all betook themselves to
Recreation Park. After a little prelimi
nary "wanning up" they lined up for the
first struggle of the season.* Â¦

San Francisco started after Doyle from
the -outset, and scored "runs', and hits, in
every inning but two. AJlthe boys w>re
handy with the stick. Every player ham

British King Interested
in the Case" of Mrs.
Maybricl^.
This condition of affairs has been grad
ually working out during the last . few
months, but it was not until to-day that
the final move was completed, when the
Federal Salt Company secured control of
the Peterman salt beds and became ab
solute master of the salt product of the
coast. It was the effort to accomplish
this end that caused most of the troubles
that have surrounded Mt. Eden and the
Petermans. The Federal ' Salt Company
controlled all of the salt lands of Ala
meda County except those owned by the
Petermans, and as the Peterman lands
are the most valuable in ' the county, the
salt trust was anxious to secure posses
sion of them. Some of the Peterman
heirs wanted to lease to the salt trust and
some did not. A quarrel arose in the
family; the mother was committed to the
asylum, and what with attacks from
without and dissension : within the Peter
man estate bade fair to dissipate into the
air of contention and the Peterman lands
became heavily encumbered,
At last the mother wafc restored . to
competency, the heirs settled up . their
quarrels, and to-day the . Salt
Company has secured all that It wants
around Mt. Edenâ the Peterman salt
marshes. The lease was placed on rec
ord to-day by which they secure these
lands for five years for $1500 a year. â¢ Out
of this amount the Federal Salt Company
is to pay the interest on the mortgage on
the property and $500 a year on the prin
cipal of the mortgage. Upon the signing
of the lease Mrs. Pcterman received J3S75.
for which she releases the company from
all claims she may have against it.' Mrs.
Peterman has a suit for damages pending
against the company and this specific
sum Is. In settlement of that, claim.
The Peterman . family troubles have
been settled, Mrs. Mary Peterman has
been restored to competency, the tangles
over the famous ML Eden salt marshes
have come to an end and the Federal
Salt Company now holds complete \ and
absolute control of the entire salt output
of the coast.

ful fellow, and his eccentricities were al
ways getting him into trouble. Through

tangle. .

. G. B. Daniels, managing editor ot tha
Oakland Enquirer, . escaped the ordeal pt
the witness stand in Judge Greene's court
to-day, where , he might . have be<jn forced
to tell what he knows about Dr." Pardee's
and 'Assessor Daltbn's' Interests in the
paper, through. the negligence 'of D. "Ed
ward Collins' attorneys, who did not force
the examination ;that they announced
early in the week. Â¦ â¢"*. l<
Editor . Daniels has had several escapes
from, the witness chair. He escaped ' from
the. Court ! Commissioner one day while
actually sitting In tHe chair and all the
king's horses and al^ tne king's .men"
couldn't drag him back into it again.
:The editor's rivals at last "hit upon the
plan of having him ' testify before City
Justice. Stetson, but the Justice, on 'the
advice of his attorney, who is also Dan
iels' attorney, declined to have anything
to. do with the matter. When" Collins*
attorneys, Messrs. Ach and Richardson,
tried to mandamus the Justice ' to Issue
a subpena Judge Greene found that'every
thing, was regular in the proceedings ex
cept that they had not tendered 25 cents
as a fee and that proceeding 1 fell.
Then Collins* attorneys -declared that â¢
that deposition would be taken before '
Judge Greene and all hands prepared to
see another | technical battle wage'd^to
day.' But it did not materialize. Messrs.
Ach and Richardson had a .week to 'act.
but they . did not â¢ even . issue a supbena.
The ; reason things- were allowed to 11 Â«
dormant, it is said, is because Ach is too
busy, but the real reason, Collins' *oÂ»-;
ponents say, is that Judge Hall recently
found himself powerless to take a deposi
tion or enforce a subpena for a deposition
and that that- makes them hopeless of
getting a decision in their favor. J:

VASELINE NO GOOD FOB HAIR.
Dandruff Germ Thrives In It, as Well
as in All Grease.
A well-known Chicago hair specialist in-
vited the Inter Ocean reporter, to come to
his office and see, under . a microscope,
how the germ that causes dandruff
thrives in vaseline. The specialist said
that all hair preparations containing
grease simply furnish food for the germs
and hr!p to propagate them. The only,
way to cure dandruff is to destroy the
germs, and the only hair preparation that
will do that is Newbro's Herpicide. "De-
Ftroy the cause, you remove the effect."
Without dandruff no falling hair, no bald-
ness. Ask for Herpicide. It Is, the only
destroyer pf the dandruff germ.

Forster and Antolee, the favorite, at the
close of the mile and a sixteenth handi
cap, while MacGyle was third, only ' a
neck further away. The winner had Larry
Daly on his back and cut out nearly all
the running with his 101 pounds to should
er. Troxler astride Antolee, would un
doubtedly have been returned first had he
not been pocketed all around the far
turn. The mare could not get clear sail
ing until' about three-sixteenths from the
wire, when she closed lost ground like a
streak of lightning. Position was outfoot

racing luck, finishing third. Diomed, a 7
to I chance, ridden by Troxler, jumped
away in the lead and was never headed.
Diderot, another outsider, took place hon
ors.
In the etx and ft hftlf fnriongr selling
jaunt the favorite, Dr. Boyle, had poor
Honlton, the fast daughter of Ormonde,
defeated Alsono ' j for 'the two-year-old
daj.li, covering the four furlongs in 45 sec
onds. The last named colt went to the
post cncddi*-on favorl'.e and should have
won. lUinsch,:* however, 'allowed Jackson
to get too far in front with H^nifoti. and
fell r hort at the wire by a length. Deutch
land, showed to splendid advantage, run
ning a cood third.
Mike- !>&!>â¢ started a warm, one In tha
opening sprint in Golden Cottage, and It
Just fell short of landing by a half-length.
The erood thing raced out in front with
the favorite, E. M. Brattain, and once in
the Btrctc> looked to have the race won.'
At the paddock Cottage began backing
up, loelne In a hard drive. ' Dandy was
third. * Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ -.-.-<;, Â¦::Â¦:< â¢ ',.â¢:.! -\
From the start the sport was far above
the average, the termination of the differ
ent events being emphasized by sharp and
exciting finishes. Honlton, Diomed and
Commissioner Forster got home at remu
nerative odds, with favoritei first In the
other races run. Jackson carried oft the
honors by riding three winners.
ppypo HERE never was any doubt exist
11 ing as to the ultimate winner of
I the Waterhouse handicap at Oak-
H land yesterday from the time the
barrier was released. The dis
tance vat two .miles, and Nones, carrying
top weight, 115 pounds, and a 4 to 5 favor
ite, captured the $2500 prize for Owner T.
Ryan es easily as snuffing a candle. Sid
dons, the game but hopelessly outclassed
winner of the Thornton four-mile stake,
was second. Frangible, with "Bill" Knapp
up, ran third. Distance events appear to
tickle the public's fancy,' and the fine
â¢weather attracted a large crowd to see
the event decided. Nones, with J. Ransch
vp, was extensively backed, and the price
looked a good one, but bo were Siddons,
Frangible, Lizzella and Rio Shannon, the
letter's odds dropping from 20 to 12. The
race was a pretty one, with little attempt
at loafing. The first mile and a quarter
was covered in 2:10, with Lizzella and
Frangible the pacemakers. Then Ransch
let Nones down, and turning off the mile
s.cd a half in 2:36, only galloping, had his
field groggy. The favorite passed the wire
first Just nodding In 3:28, within two sec
onds of the California record, made by
Judge Denny. Behind him Lee Jackson,
after a liberal application of heels and
whip on Siddons for fully a mile, outfln
ished Kna-pp, taking the place. Lizzella
and Rio Shannon were not dangerous fac
tors after a mile had been reeled off. The
race was worth $1925 to. the winner.

Trout fishing is reported good in all the
streams of the county, due j undoubtedly
to the large numbers planted in recent
years and the protection afforded the
streams by the Fish and Game Protective
Association.
In the large mess of fish were many
magnificent specimens of trout. Accord
ing ' to the . fishermen -Smiths Creek .is
teeming with trout. They were , the first
on the creek.
SAN JOSE, April 5.â One thousand trout
in two days is the phenomenal record
made by. a quartet' of fishermen on Smiths
Creek, near Mount Hamilton, this week.
The_ party consisted of William : Kerr,
John_McGeoghegan, Walter Kerr and
John '; French of this city, and } they, re
turned to-day from their \outing. ; This is
the. largest 'catch made in this county in
many years. ; . - . r.

There was a fashionable ' gathering, at
the gymkhana games held at Burlingame 4
yesterday under the auspices of the San
Mateo Hunt Club. All the leaders of the
r-mart set were present and participated in
the amusements. The games were held on
Francis J. Cardan's polo field. There
were pony races, jumping and many novel
and mirthful ! events. â¢ -
- T. J. Drysbrough, who acted; as judge,
master of ceremonies and referee, wielded
a bandana handkerchief in lieu of a flag.
"Walter S. Hobart, J. J. Moore and
Carolan had out their fastest polo and.
jumping ponies. The equipages were
strikingly handsome. ' :-' -
The first event was an egg and spoon
race on horseback. In the first heat were
Mr. Hobart and Mr. -Carolan. The latter
won owing to his steady hand. .The sec
ond heat was taken by Mr. "Wilson, with
Lawrence McCreery a close second.' The
final waa won by Mr. Carolan. Wilson
was winning handily, but became nervous
when nearlng the finish and dropped the
t'gg.
Walter Hobart essayed to win the high,
jumping match, but his horse shied at
the sticks when they were Bet at four feet
nine inches. " Merry Boy, one of Mr. Caro
lan"s hunters, won the event with Charles'
Richards, a groom, in the saddle. Del
Monte, ow.ned'by J. J. Moore and ridden
by Jerry Williams, a groom, was second.
In an exhibition Del Monte cleared five
feet, showing the most graceful style of
any horse in the competition.
The egg and spoon race for. ladles had
many starters. The ladies sprinted fifty
yards carrying an egg in a spoon. Miss
Howard won the final. Miss Celia Tobln
was second and Miss Wittell third. The
other starters were Princess Poniatowski,
Mrs. Carolan, Mrs. Henry T. Scott . and
Mrs. Wilson.
; The amusing event on ; the programme
was the race for "travelers." It was run
off in two heats. The riders had to race
on horseback "to one end of the polo field
with a bag in 'their hands and on return-
Ing to the starting place dismount, remove
their. coats and place them in therecep
tacle and then don pajamas. The men
made a ludicrous appearance as they tried
to hurry on the flowing garments, wr,
Hobart captured the first heat and Mr.
Menzies the second. The final went to
Menzies because Hobart dropped his pack,
age. The other starters were Messrs.
Carolan, Wheeler, McCreery, Wilson,
Bej-lard and B. M. Tobin.
The affair was a complete success la

ulative element which has caused the revival
In the market during tht latter part of the
week, but their operations had to meet heavy
realizing ealee after the opening. The market
had turned upward aceln when the disclosures
cf the important shrinkage In the surplus re
serve of the bank* renewed the selling and sent
prices generally below last night's level. Louis
ville and Nashville was the only important
etock to make notable headway on, the final
rally and the market dese-d irregular. .There
mas some reversion to the obscurer clans vt
etoefcs, as shown by the 20 points in Burling
ton, Ccder Rapids and Northern, 8 In United
States Express and Z\i in Nashville, Chatta
nooga and St. Louis. Hocking Valley made a
renewed advance. Susar and Colorado Fuel
wen under pressure, but rallied effectively.
The banks failed to ehow the expected set-off
to the drain In the Sub-Treasury by a gain in
the interior movement of currency. Apparently
losses were ineurivl on This account as well as
on Â£ub-Treaeury operation*. There Beern to

Surplus. $2,649,525; decrease, $4,31C,O.".O.
The Financier says: The statement of the
New York Associated Banks last week showed
a loss of $4,499,800 In cash, of which $4,128,600
consisted of specie. , . * ,
Â¦ The estimates of the cash movement for the
week indicated a decrease in this Item of
$2,546,700. and the difference, between the es
timated and the actual loss may be accounted
for either by the system of averages or by the
unrecorded movement of money. The ' loans
were increased $3,148,900. indicating conserva
tism on the part of the banks. In view of the
general tendency of the reserves and also of
expected requirements for crop purposes. The
deposits show a decrease of $735,000, or $615,900
less than the difference between the loss of
cash and the Increase ' of loans. Reserve re
quirements were reduced by $183,750, which
amount deducted from the decrease in cash
leaves $4.:$ltt,0r>0. representing the loss of sur
plus reserves. This Item now stands at $2,649,
525, against $5,817,975 at the 'corresponding date
a year ago. The interior bank mqvement of
money last .week, 60 far as it was traceable,
showed an excess of receipts over shipments.'
but this appears to have been largely due to
returns -Of . currency from' the South. Â¦ the. de
mand for - the cotton movement having . about
subsided. Crop . planting: and farm work teem
to have been retarded at the West because, of
unseasonable weather, and this fact may ac
ccunt for. the light -demand for money during
the week from that section. This inquiry is,
however, only deferred, and it may be expected
to become important as weather conditions im
prove. The collections of April interest' from
the Government were notably -.tardy Jast week
and the checks for this Interest will probably
â¢all be presented during: the current .week,' so
that the Â¦ operations oC the ' sub-treasury will
mort likely result in a smaller drain from the
banks than was observed 1 last week, j 1 Morfl
over. part of the 'gain by that office was due
to payments by the banks on account of retir
ing circulation, which will probably be small
.for the remainder of the month. -The fact ap
pears,.-however, that the Â¦â¢ treasury is steadily
accumulating surplus and that there Is small
prospect of Its liberal distribution. ~- This ab
sorption of money by ' the treasury - and tha
hiph rates for exchange which theaten gold ex
perts ' seem Â¦ to make it improbable that there
will be an improvement in bank reserves, at'
least until, the end of the spring eeason.

CHICAGO, April 5.â There was very little
desire- to do one . thing or the other In wheat.
Bearish conditions seemed to be in the ' major
ity, but the slight breaks experienced were met
with fair rallies. .At the outset cables were
lower, but the. crowd was talking of the sale
by an elevator of over 1,000,000 bushels of
cash wheat at Duluth and refusals of bids for
400,000 bushels more. This business was said
to have been done late yesterday and to' have
been the Incentive for the heavy early buying
in the previous session. On this factor May
opened rather firm, unchanged to ' %c up at
7o'5i@71%c. The crowd felt : very bearish and
the Missouri State crop report indicating that
the 5 per cent increaxe of- acreage In wheat
and a condition of 90 started lower prices. The
crowd was inclined to doubt the ' cash sale
story, but though May prices* sold off to 70%<g>
70%c a small demand occasioned a reaction
and May closed steady, a shade up at 70%Â©
71<L : - ' " - Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ - Â¦
â¢ liquidation of May deliveries by commission
houses and little support by the bull crowd
depressed prices In corn -Liverpool was weak.
May closed %c lower at 58%@5S%c.
Oats were dull. May " closed %c lower at
42%c. - ... Â¦Â¦ . â¢ . .
Provisions were dull much of the time, but
had an up- turn on the better hog. situation.
May pork, closed 7 %@10c up, lard 2%c higher
and ribs unchanged. . .
In nuts shelled almonds occupy the chief at
tention, and for Sicily there is considerable
firmness reported. Stocks are reported closely
held. Bari almonds are also firmer anO a
good movement in email lots is noted. Va
leneias are steady and Jordan* continue FcarcÂ«
end firm. More Interest is coted In filberts,
â¢with holders' ideas somewhat stronger. Brazil
nuts are quiet. A fair Jobbing trade is noted
:n walnuts." Â¦
"In prunes the market to-day is quiet and
the demand fcr Email lots. For the largo fixes
in new fruit, 40-50s are held at from CV-c to
<jT*c in Â£5-lb boxes; 6tzes 00-COs, C0-70s" and
70-SOs show a steady range on the quoted basis
lcr new and old, but we hear of no important
tales. In the smaller sizes sellers' ideas in a
jobbing way are unchanged.
"For raitins there is noted a moderate de
mand, with loose S-crown grade held at 7c in
most quarters. Stocks are light. In seeded
no particular interest is observed and spllers'
ideas ranpe from S%c on choice and S%c on
fancy in 10-ounee cartons. Bulk Is steady. A
lalrly steady feeling: Is reported in Imported
\ clencia layers and prices are firm at ~V>e for
email lots. Apricots and peaches are In fair
request within the quoted range. Dates are
t-teady and fairly firm. Figs Â«show a good
interest and prices remain firm.
â¢â¢Generally through the -list a moderate
business is noted, the movement continuing
chiefly in a email way on local and nesrby
Jobbing account. For currants the market is
lalrly steady, occasional business !n a rmall
way being heard of at 5c for fine Amalias un
cleaned in barrels. There is noted in seme
quarters inquiries here from the interior for
round lots, with, however, prospective buyers*
Ideas under those- of ec-llers. There is littlt if
tiny <JisiK>smon shown among holders to jneet
bids of 4vic, and in some quarters conflcUnce
is expressed that with the opening of 4akÂ»-and
rail navigation and the advantage of lower
ftelght rwtes to buyers, a revival of Interest in
the article will result. The primary market is
reported steady at prices above the parity of
epot cost to lay down.

to requirements growing out of labor troubles
in the coal fields. * â¢
The activity in the stock market gave warn
ing of a probable Increase In the Joan account
of the banks. The net result is a cutting down
of the surplus by ., two-thirds. Gold exports
are considered probable next week. The pass-
Ing of April settlements has resulted In only
a moderate growth of speculative interest ' In
stocks. In spite of the efforts of professional
operators to attract an outside following by ma
nipulatior of prices. The most conspicuous
price movements of the week have been at
tributed almost entirely to such manipulation.
The sudden spurt after the mlddle-of-the-week
In the Grangers and Pacifies gave rUe^to some
conjectures of Important developments under
cover, but nothing came to the public knowl
edge to explain it. The supposition Is general
that the clement which has been active in the
market is made up of Western men, who are
conducting parallel operations in the grain
market. There was evidence of a shltt during
the week by speculators from the long to the
short side ip grain and from the short to the
long side in stocks. There have been operations
also by professional pools in many of the minor
railroads, apparently on the general asEump
. Uoa that the minor systems will ultimately
be sought for absorption by the great systems,
or for consolidation into new competing sys
tems. Obscure industrial, stocks have contin
ued to spring into sudden activity from time to
time without special explanation, or on reports
which fali of confirmation. Relapses In prices
as sudden as the advances thereon follow. These
various symptoms go to show that the great
banking and financial interests of the country,
whose operations formed the backbone of last
year's great markets, are still holding aloot.
These interests are supposed to ' hold vast
amounts of securities, the products of last
year's combination projects, which are destined
for ultimate distribution to the public. Their
abstention from the stock market .operations is
supposedly due to their conviction that the prco
ent attitude of investors toward securities is
not favorable to their distribution. Attention
of the speculative public has reverted to UiS
situation in the Northwestern and transconti
nental railroad field by reason of the testimony
elicited from the principals in the great con
test of last year in a lawsuit. The ostentatious
willingness of these principals to tell all they
r.-cre asked to In a railway suit of minor im
portance lt&elf made an impression on the fin
ancial world. The deduction is that a policy
of conciliation of public opinion is consider^
desirable by capitalists. The same impression
is created by the action taken by counsel for
the railroad!' in the Government's suits fcr in
junctions araitiEt secret - rebates, and cutting
of freight rates. The acceptance of injunctions
without demur and the protestation by railroad
officials of their willingness to have published
rates enforced are taken as evidence of a de
sire to have a legal status fixed for the exist
ing order of things, as against the contingency
of new measures of coercion and regulation.
There le evident solicitude in railroad circles
over the pronouncement of one of the Inter
ttale Ccramerce Commissioners that "you can
not have competition and you must put some
thing in the place of it." All of the testimony
of the principals in the Northern Securities
Company was directed to convey the assurance
that competition is not interfered with in that
organization. â¢ It is perceptible that these as
surances have created some apprehension In the
financial world and that the unity of control of
purpose in transcontinental railroad .aftaJra
was, in fact, not eo far perfected by last year's
huge projects as was at first supposed '.a the
speculative excitement then prevailing; No
treaty provision is revealed which -will guard
against the competition of extensions by other
lines in the transcontinental territory in ac
cordance with their manifest destiny. The
capital increase by Rock Island, and the pass
age of control of minor railroad systems in the
territory concerned are looked upon as evidence
of projects oC extension which necessarily will
be followed by other systems. In the Eastern
territory the intention of the Gould system to
secure an Eastern coast outlet Is accepted .as a
fact, and the alleged friendly acquiesence of the
rival trunk lines is not believed by the Wall
street public. This represents a very different
state of affairs from the supposed comprehen
sive community of interest among railroad own
ers which" was commonly credited during the
two million chares daily transactions on the
Stock Kxchange during the boom last year.
The future of the money market seems to
rest largely on the future requirements of for
eign money markets for the satisfaction of the
British Government loan and other Government
operations for which it is expected gold will
have to be sent from New York. The questions
of the crops and of important labor settlements,
remain to be settled and must be looked to as
Important influences upon the stock market..
There has been an increased -demand for
bonds and prices have generally Improved.

fuel for naval use as follows:
For a given weight oil ha3 double the steam
ing radius, of coal. It occupies less space than
coal. The tanks- built In the vessel greatly
strengthen her. The effect of the tanks full of
oil â or water If the oil had been used â would
localize the injury of a shot through the hull
and would - render the vessel 50 per cent , less
sinkable than at present. The oil would pre
serve the hull. Interior from corrosion, thus pro
longing the life of the vessel indefinitely. -The
tanks when emptied of oil cctald-be filled with
water, thus maintaining the \Â°ssel at a per
manent load line; this means lt^t depthi of ar
mor on both stdea because the vessel would
never be light in going Into action." as she
would be had she consumed her coal. No water
ballast tanks necessary, Â¦ meaning great econ
omy in space. Boilers can be so arranged . that
oil tanks can be carried between them and the
skin of the vessel, which would afford as good.
If not better, protection than side coal bunkers.
If such vessel la sunk she can be easily floated,
IE In shallow water, by pumping out the tanks.
Great saving in crew and crew space. No
I The oil . production of .California fell off
about 100 barrels in March;: as compared
with the preceding month. There was a
slight increase in the number of wells
completed, ;but they are largely in dis
tricts where small production is the rule,
the game is still a waiting one so far as
many, owners of oil property are con
cerned. (The tendency, to better conditions
is recognized, but -the price has not yet
reached the point to encourage wider pro
duction. In the Fullerton field there is
now ' a surplus . that has tj outgrown â' the
"storage facilities provided.' : Fullerton has
decided.to' erect more tanks..' ;
"The operations of the Standard Oil Com
pany; still hold' the center of the stage.
Some question has been raised as to
iwhether the Standard; would not. have a
large" advantage over; all competitors .in
the local San Francisco market by reason
of the difference -between railroad charges
and; the cost, of piping,- but this Is met 'by
the statement , that the .. Associated Oil
Company, which is the largest local con
cern ; in the field, = Is enabled Â¦ under the
terms of Incorporation to construct a pipe
line, 1 to build steamers and to do all other
ithings' necessary to enable It. to hold its
share of the field.
