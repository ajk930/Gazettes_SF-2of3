The two dynamiters then took a train
to Vancouver, and were again followed
by. the detectives. They stayed here for
one day and then proceeded to Victoria,
from which city they could Â¦ operate
against^Esquimalt, which is a couple of
miles out of town. In Victoria the two
detectives gave up most of their watch

The two men came ' directly through
to Seattle, where they spent a couple of
days. . They made small purchases in the
stores, visited many people and gave the
detectives a -warm time in watching
them. While there was no definite as
surance of this possible to.be gained at
the time, it was afterward clearly learned
that, they made arrangements to secure
an amount of high explosives in Seattle'
and from there would take it to Vic

making the arrangements the British
authorities had been busy. Not. only
did they guard in every possible way
against an unforeseen stroke, but they

Confession Is Made
to an Astute
Sergeant.
Irishmen who are -prominent in the
local patriotic" societies when seen last
night' in legard to "the alleged attempt
to Â¦ blow* up Esquimalt emphatically de
nied that there ever was a branch of the
Clan-Na-Gael in this city. .They also
stated that they knew of no Irishmen
of Â¦Â¦ the , names mentioned in the Van
couver dispatch who could possibly be
implicated in any plot;against the Brit
ish/naval station.; Ifsucha society ever
had its existence in this city or on the
Pacific Coast, according to , the local
Irish leaders, it must have been com
posed of a very few of the most radical
haters of England who had no standing
am6ng the Irish people.
.V: Joseph P. Kelleher of the . Ancient
ijDrder of Hibernians stated that he had
never heard of such a society existing in
this city. He said that he knew of many
patriotic Irish societies, but he knew
nothing of the Clan-Na-Gael.
. "That I cannot do," was " the reply,
"but they were prominent men. I was
not stationed in San Francisco at the
time and am not conversant .with all the
details of the affair. I can only say the
plot was; concocted here, and I cannot
give any information as to how the de
tails were secured by - the consulate.
The phrase 'from information received'
will cover it. The only thine new in
the affair at this time is that the details
should be "made public in British Co
lumbia." - /. .
. "Are you at, liberty to give the names
of any menwho were connected with
the society you mention?" was asked of
the Consul General. '
"This matter is not new." said Consul
General Bennett, "and the British Gov

tions of the plotters. Of course I can
not say how the information came to the
knowledge . of my predecessor in of

any names. It was the work of a society

The information communicated by the
Consul at San; Francisco' was that a
meeting of the Clan-Na-Gael had : been
held there at which means were dis
cussed of how to aid the Boers in their
war against Great Britain. When the
meeting was called at first there was no
intention to suggest the ; use of force;
but McDermott, who was present, of
fered togo to Esquimalt and attempt a
body blow by dynamiting as much as
possible of the forts and the navy docks
there, He asked for the naming of a
companion to assist him in the deed.
The first information received by the
British Columbia Government was from
the Governor General, the Earl of Min
to. The latter had been advised official
ly by the British, Consul at San Fran
cisco. Premier Semlin sent .word to
Admiral Beaumont, who was ' at that
time in charge of Esquimalt and com
mandant of the North Pacific squad
ron. The two consulted, and that even
ing the commanding officer issued an
order that the guards on the forts and
the navy-yard should be doubled and
only the most trusted men should be de
tailed for duty. : ; ' Â¦'.V' "Â¦

Premier, and he was officially interested

from San Francisco for- the purpose of
carrying out the blowing up of the

latter a native of Belgium. . . -vxV
In an interview the ex-Premier told
of the frustration of a plan to blow up
the big. navy docks and if possible the
fortress of Esquimalt. The entire plan
was arranged in San'Francisco by mem
bers of the Clan-Na-Gael. Its fortunate
discovery by agents of the British Con
sul in the Golden City caused the fail

Extraordinary Story

Gigantic Conspiracy
Hatched in San
Francisco.
Whatever President Loerring did must
be taken as having been done in hl3 pri
vate capacity, as he had no power to act
without; the approval of his colleagues,
and when they heard of what had been
done they did not approve. Anyhow, Cap
tain Christmas started off for Washing
ton with a certain letter from President
Loerring, and claiming to rep&sent Den
mark. He was bound to come across
Gron, and the pot and the kettle met and
collided.
OPPOSITION TO SALE.
Captain Christmas was forced to re
veal his business. Gron was indignant.
He was then conducting his business
through H. H. Rogers of the Standard
Oil Company. Gron had had* a letter to
â¢Rogers from a Danish capitalist named
Hagemann.- Captain Christmas had an
exactly similar letter of recommendation.
The entire upper house, in secret com
mittee, held a sitting to-day on the Dani
ish Antilles >ale. Several fanatical
speeches formed Its feature, all wildly op
posing the transaction. .
Dr. Duentzer, Prime Minister, appealed
for support of the sale on economical and
practical ground. Then Peter3en. a -rich
man., who sent Gron over, to the United
States to start up the scandal, Indulged in
an impassioned tirade against the sale. To
avoid the sale, he . says, he would sacri
fice his entire vast fortune.

'HAS A BAD BECOBD.
The upper house has not yet sanctioned
the vote of the lower, as is necessary,
and will only do so by a meager majority,
but the Minister of Foreign Affairs has
nevertheless signed the treaty with the
United - States. Mr. Loerring. President
of the Council, was anxious to see the
sale arranged. He showed himself Indis
creet, or at all events was won over by
Captain Christmas, who is a very shrewd
and clever man. Thus the latter obtained
certain letters from the Premier. Tho
new President, Loerring, had no power
in the matter. It concerned the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, but to go to the latter
would not have suited Captain Christmas,
because the Minister of Foreign Affairs
had been Minister of Marine at' a tlma
when Captain Christmas .had been tried
by court-martial and dismissed from tho
Danish navy for being concerned in trou
bles in Slam and misrepresenting French
naval action and other things. Gron had
received 6000 kronen. Captain Christmas
was not so lucky, yet from, a private per
son Interested in the sale he managed to
get 5000 kronen.
COPENHAGEN, April 3.â Behind thÂ«
negotiations which have marked the sug
gested sale of the Danish West Indies to
the United States there lies a tale which
must interest every politician and diplo
mat. The moral of that * tale is that
statesmen and politicians cannot be too
careful in the choice of those with whom
they enter into relations. Whether theso
islands will ever become American nov
is a matter of doubt, but that such is
the case, that such doubt exists, is mere
ly owing to the indignation aroused by
the intervention of certain unauthorized
agents in a matter of international inter

WOMAN CREATES SENSATION
AT GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESS
The convention adjourned sine die after
resolutions of regret at the death of
former Governor Waite of Colorado had
been adopted. Â¦'-Â¦.â¢'.'.
The plank on money in the platform
adopted favors scientific money based up
on the entire wealth of the people of the
nation and not redeemable in any specific
commodity, but to be legal tender for all
debts, public; and private, and to be issued
by the Government only and without the
Intervention of banks, sufficient in quan
tity to meet the requirements of com
merce.
The differences between the platform
committee are very slight. In the plat
form adopted the demand for 'Initiative
and referendum is found in both the pre
amble and platform. .
The . basis of representation will be five
delegates at large from every State and
Territory and one additional delegate for
every thousand voters, based on the vote
at the preceding national election.
The national v committee will be com
posed of three members from each State
and Territory and an executive committee
of reven will be selected from the country
at 'large every four years at a national
convention.
Under the plan of organization adopted
the national committee of the People's
party, with Joseph A. Parker as its chair
man, will remain intact, with the addition,
of three more members from Missouri,
who will have half a vote each, until
the next national convention, this being
a concession -to the reform forces of that
State. This committee will have power
to call a national' convention and its head
quarters will be situated wherever the
chairman desires, except three months be
fore an election, when they will be In St.
Louis.
The convention was practically dom
inated .by the People's party. At times
discussions of a lively nature took place,
and for a while it seemec as though the
movement Â¦ was about to fail, owing to
unwillingness of a number of the People's
party delegates to make any concessions
to the other reform forces present.
While the People's party, the Fusion
Populists, the Socialists, the Referendum
League, the Union Labor party, Public
Ownership party of St. Louis, the Pro
hibition party and the United Christian
party were represented on the floor of the
convention by accredited or by volunteer
delegates, only two national * organiza
tions, the People's party and the Public
Ownership party, had given their dele
gates any authority to form an alliance.
It is the hope, however, of the Allied
People's party ihat' other reform forces
must later decide to unite with the new
Organization.

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., April 3.â
Twelve hotels and . more than a
score of small .buildings adjoin
ing the boardwalk, which is built
along the ocean' edge, ' were de
stroyed to-day by a flre which swept the
beach front for two long blocks from Illi
nois avenue to New York avenue. The
loss, it is believed, will exceed $750,000. In
this respect the conflagration is the moat
disastrous, that has ever visited this city.
The loss will be only partially covered by
Insurance, as the rate of 5 per cent
charged by insurance companies on prop-;,
-erty here is regarded as almost prohibi
tive. .
: Charles Frallnger, ] proprietor; of -Â¦ the
Academy of Music and a drugstore in the
building, to-night; said-he was the heav
iest individual loser, by the fire. He places
his loss at, upward of $125,000, and; said he

During the progress of the flre the wild
est excitement preva lad among the-guests
of r the hotels, which later ; became prey
to the flames. With the exception : of the
Tarlton and Uhe-Bryn Mawr all of the
hostelries 5 were ; open for the season and
most of them were fairly well filled.- In
most cases the guests , had : sufficient time
to pack their trunks and grips; andithose

Excitement Among 1 Guests.
The fire was discovered shortly after 9
o'clock this morning, and for nearly five
hours the flames raged with such violence |
as- to threaten the city with destruction.
All of the burned; buildings were frame
structures, and -the flames, fanned by .a
strong west wind, swept along the beach
front with amazing rapidity. : The Tarlton
was soon a pile of smoldering debris, and
the â¢ flames fed on the small stores and
booths between Illinois and Kentucky
avenues until they reached the Stratford
Hotel, which was soon enveloped. The
flery tongues leaped to the Berkeley, ad
joining, and in a" few minutes the New,
Holland, 1 , the' BrynMawr, the Evard and
the Stlckney, all located on Kentucky
avenue,, near the beach, were doomed.'
The local tire ; department worked well
aitd willingly, but was unable to cope
with the flames, and it was found neces
sary to send to Philadelphia and Camden
for aid.' The former city sent three;en
gines and two came, down from Camden.
The engines 1 were Brought here on two
special trains furnished by the Pennsyl
vania Railroad, and they made the run of
nearly sixty -miles in flfty-flve minutes.
Their presence was of vast assistance to
the, local llrcmen, but it was not until an
hour after their arrival that the flre could
be" said to be . thoroughly under control.
Jusfas the special train bearing the Phil
adelphia firemen arrived a burning brand
set 'flre. to \hG center; of Young's pier,
near Tennessee avenue. Meantime the
flames/had communicated \with .the Rio
1 Grande, the Mervine Â¦ and the Academy
hotels and. the Academy of Music,. at the
corner of ; New York â¢ avenue and the
beach.- For. a: few; minutes Young's- pier
burned fiercely, but the liremen succeeded
in confining the flames to Marine Hall,
which was situated' in the center > of the
pier. Â¦ Â¦,
In addition to the foregoing there were
numerous other smaller booths and sev

The discussion was largely in the nature
of a reinforcement of arguments previ
ously advanced. Spooner of Wisconsin
made the principal speech, maintaining
that Congress had ample authority to en
act the proposed legislation because it
was in the interest of the people..' In an
earnest protest against the measure Vest
of Missouri held that Congress was In
vading the powers of the States. Scott
of West Virginia moved to recommit the
measure to the committee, holding that
It was unsatisfactory to many Senators
and ought to be perfected. The motion
was defeatedâ 35 to 37.

telegrams pouced Into the Senate from all

not unknown to Western music lovers,
and to dwell upon all the claims of su-

would consume too much space. Suffice it
to say, therefore, that the Crown piano
is the original and only piano of many
tones, It Is the only piano having a prac-
tice clavier, and with this piano one can
reproduce the tones of some twenty dif-
ferent instruments, such as the harp,
zither, guitar, banjo, autoharp, mandolin,
cello, etc. It is a Crown piano at the
Orpheum this week by means of which
Homer Lind is producing Such numerous
truly astonishing tone effects. Don't fail
to see the only piano of many tones.

AN ANGELUS AND CROWN
PIANO.
"We are instructed by Mr. C. A. Alisky
of this city to sell for his account an
especially fine Orchestral Grand Crown
piano, together with an elegant Orches-
tral.- Angelus piano player. The Crown
piano is a duplicate of the fine instrument
used by Homer Lind at the Orpheum this
week. This piano is the original many-
toned instrument, by means of which the
music of any stringed instrument, such as
the guitar, mandolin, harp, autoharp.
spinnet, etc., can be perfectly reproduced.
YOU CAN PLAY IT EVEN IF
YOU D0NT KNOW HOW
TO PLAY.
The Angelus is an Instrument enabling
any one without any knowledge of music
or notes whatsoever to play with the most
perfect expression even the most difficult
music ever composed. In addition to this
the Angelus contains an orchestral ac-
| companiment effect, such as the flute and
: the violin. v ,
These instruments originally cost $S00,
and are in every respect as good as new.
We will guarantee them In every detail.
We are instructed to dispose of them at "
once, and to accomplish this- object can
almost split the price in two. Nor need
the sale be for all cash, as reasonably
small mont-hly payments can be arranged
with any responsible purchaser. Better
see these instruments early. They will
surely be sold before Saturday night.

We have also a special bargain in a

\ 718 Market Street,WASHINGTON, April 3.â General Sam
uel Pearson,'' formerly of the /Boer army,
has returned : to .Washington ',; (f rom New
Orleajis, where he went to '' gather proof
to substantiate his charges that the.-B.rft-
ish authorities in ; . Louisiana had,' t In vio
lation of the. laws of neutrality.- set up 'a
regular military Â¦Â¦ .establishment, \froin
which ; their ; army in- South Africa was
furnished,. with ; men. horses, . mules and
supplies.' . , General ,;: Pearson L Â¦ made this 1 ,
charge in a letter i to President Roosevelt,
who, he^ says.Hsent it to Governor. Heard
of Louisiana for investigation and report,
and the ' latter, in "- turn . called on him
(Pearson) for. proofs. ""
General '< Pearson 'to-night declared that
America had contributed rat least 42,000
men' -to aid the 1 -: British iri' their flght
against the Boers and had; furnished the
British ' Government ~ with 201,107 horses
and mules. The. men, -he declared, 1 consist
of muleteers shipped , from, Nejr Â¦ Orleans,
some of whom have * been ' compelled to
enlist against -the - burghers, and paid
agents and: men ..who. are sent " ; throughout
the country to buy up 'horses and mules.
He said there . are,, one . British 'general^
two colonels and', sixty captains. and lieu
tenants in !Â¦ this : country now, ,â¢ with head
quarters, at New Orleans. V â¢ 'Â¦]â¢ t
The general alleged that although' men
are engaged with the understanding that
when they reach Cape Tqwn they may re
turn on the first " ship ; leaving ' for Â¦. the
United States,' their passage; is refused, or
long delayed, and every influence" brought
to bear on them, to enlist in the British
army.. With every shiploadof mules sent
to South Africa the disguised British'of
ficers in charge of the, transport and car
go, he said; employ a small army of men
to .take care of these : animals, securing
enough men to assign one to every. two or
three mules. The men who go as mule
teers r or stable hands,* the ; general added, j
are of ' the lowest, classes and care little
what they: do or where they â¢ go. Ha
claims the British also have failed to keep
contracts with the men. leaving them pen
niless in a strange land. . :
Secretary Hay has received from Gov

referred to in this morning's publications ;
alleging the existence ' of a British, camp'

PRETORIA, Wednesday, April 2.âCom
munications' have ' passed between" Presi
dent Steyn and the Transvaal mission at
Krbnstad, but nothing is yet known of
the result. The majority of the military
men and civilians here expect more from
the continual pressure of the troops than
from the negotiations. It is pointed. out
that; once before, 1 when hard i pressed, the
Transvaalers showed a - desire for peace,
;but this was ; promptly overridden by
President Steyn. â¢ Nothing In the present
situation." go far as known, indicates that
President Steyn Is less irreconcilable- than
previously. Indeed, the known-facts seem
to point, to a greater determination to con
tinue the struggle.
Governor of Louisiana, it la believed that
even now the department' Is not without
it3 own ideas as to what is going on- at
Chalmette,* and this knowledge has not
shaken -the department's- original view
that thfcse operations are entirely lawful
and that there is no power in the national
or : State governments to prevent .them.
So long as the shipments from Chalmette
are confined to horses, livestock, fodder
and provisions and the port Is not made

.tary expedition it is held that there is no
warrant for. interference, even If the sup

for work for the Government it shall be
specified that the work is to be done on
an eight-hour basis. This measure has
been strongly supported by labor organ

There was also technical objection to

nomination.

Charles M. Schwab, president' of the
United States : Steel Corporation, was
elected a member of the chamber at to
day's meeting.
After Senor Palma's speech a vote of
thanks was extended to him and a resolu
tion was offered by Francis B. Thurber in
favor of a 50 â¢ per cent reduction in the
present Cuban tariff. After much discus
sion the resolution was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Trade, .with , the
proviso that such committee report at a
special meeting one week from to-day.
Albert Mosely, an English commissioner,
who came to the United States to study
trade conditions here,- addressed . the
chamber. He said that in his opinion the
educational system was the foundation of
the country's prosperity.
I therefore avail myself of this opportunity
to enlist your help, your earnest support \ in
order to obtain from the Congress of the United
States â the House and the Senate â a substan
tial reduction in the duties on sugar and to
bacco â a reduction larger than that recom
mended by the Conynlttee on Ways and Means
in the House, which will in no way afford any
relief to the present distress of the Cuban pro
ducers. --T, > .' : .
On the Chamber of Commerce of New York
and each one of its estimable members depend
in great measure the attainment of the advan
tageous result, as the enormous amount of
business which - this chamber represents ' cer
tainly needs a vast, an immense field, and
Cuba, lying within hand's reach, affords one
of the best grounds for profitable trade.
Still more, if we look on the moral aspect of
the commercial movement of a country,-; we
find that by its blessed effects order and. peace
are assured within and feelings of friendship
and good will strengthened without. >- In mod
ern . times commerce has materially developed
its real force, attaining the character of . a
powerful factor in the social relations of man.
It is principally due to the interests created
by it that nations are anxious for peace and
devote their efforts. to smothering old grudges
which otherwise might break out at any time
on the slightest pretext. > -. ., . . ,.
With my conviction that the best and surest
way to attach one country to another, consists
in building up and strengthening the trade re
lations through reciprocal exchange of products
and the development of other Interests in the
fame line I. who -entertain for Cuba, my na
tive country, the greatest love and feel at the
same time deep gratitude to the. United States,
where for eighteen years I have met with the
most kind, generous ; and cordial hospitality,
am anxious to see both countries . closely ' con
nected and firmly united by a reciprocal com-'
mercial treaty, drawn on the - most favorable
terms, a treaty to the end that Cuba becomes
the largest market in 'America for the products
of the United -States, and that this country
raise the bar now placed against Cuban products
of sugar and tobacco, which are the principal
staples of the island and constitute the- only
basis we have to start on in unfolding other
NEW YORK, April 3.â Tomas Estrada
Palma, President-elect Â¦ of . the Cuban, re
public, addressed the New York Chamber
of Commerce to-day. Palma was Intro-,
duced by Morris K.' Jessup j president , of
the chamber, who. said that in his Judg
ment commerce. was the most, important
wheel in the complex. mechanism of a po
litical body. It was an efficient factor in
developing the resources Of a country, in
promoting and building up its industries
and in fostering the energies of the people

boundaries of the nation into all parts of
the worldâ even those which are not with
in'the pale of civilization. He continued:
amendment. Because of that - amendment we
must make it possible for the people of Cuba
to govern their island successfully.
McClellan then reviews the sugar situa
tion in Cuba and this country. , He sums
up his position as follows:
First, the bill does not afford sufficient relief
to Cuba, but it minimizes the loss of the pres
ent crop of suKar; second, it is possible, but
not certain, that a 20 per cent reduction of the
Cuban train" will result in giving us a monop
oly of the Cuban market; third, the bill Is an
enunciation of the Democratic doctrine of (reci
procity; it -is a breach in the wall of protec
tion and lowers in part the preposterous Ding
ley rates. â¢ Â¦
If I am afforded the opportunity when the
bill comes before the committee of. the whole,
I shall try to amend it by increasing the rate
of reduction so as to make certain, not only
the control of the Cuban market by us. but also
the prosperity of Cuba. I shall also try to
amend by striking out the time limit.
Falling to amned, for the reasons here stated,
I shall vote for the bill.

Ventura was thrown into. the center of
the channel and was carried down about
300 yards before he could reach the shore,
while Twist drifted in a slightly different
direction and with great dlfflculty-at last
succeeded in reaching a small gravel Bar
in the center of the river. After gaining
the bank Ventura hastened to town and
reported that , Twist was on the gravel
bar. In a verV few minutes , a hundred
men or more were on ; the . bank of -the
stream devising ways and means by which
Twist. could be brought to shore. .Ropes
were at hand, but the matter of throwing
a rope to the drenched man was Imprac

recommend Uhat the first project desig
nated in the report be Incorporated in the
proposed bond issue at a cost of $460,000. .
;. The City Engineer's report comprises
fourteen projects, the first of which icon
templates the construction of a road on
the hilltop and . the ' purchase of the east
ern portion of the block bounded by Du
pont, V Greenwich,- Kearny and Lombard
streets, which would insure the preserva
tion of the hill, at a cost of $452,000. Road
construction and temporary stairways
would cost '$8000. V .
That the Merchants'- Association believes that
an additional â thoroughfare, with ' . moderate
grades,-^ from the northern seawall to the cen
tral portion of, the city, will soon become neces
sary to relieve' the congestion of travel along
the water front, and for this purpose favors the
lowering of the grade on Sansome street as
proposed by the City Engineer, on condition
that this proposition is kept separate and dis
tinct from the proposition to preserve and Im
prove Telegraph Hill, and that the proper city
authorities shall decide whether the expense of
the, lowering, of said street and the consequent
damages to adjacent property shall be borne by
the city or by an assessment district.

So far. the plans of the new company
have been kept quiet. The capitalization
will be for a large sum, sufficient for 'the

all other necessary purposes, g M. M Og

has been largely to secure the deposits of

have been bonded.
An Adequate Plant.
The distinctive feature of the Ruthen
berg process is. the taking: of the concen
trates, cleaned up to the highest.possible
point of purity;. and pitting them through'
an electric furnace,. the melting zone of
which is a magnetic field. The ore < belns
magnetic, the magnetic field, holds the
grains of magnetite, so it is claimed/ and
the polar projections of this magnetic
field, being at the same time the elec
trodes of the smelting circuit. , the mag
netic bridge* thus formed by the ore pro
duces a high resistance in the smelting
circuit. When the ore loses its magnetism
and gathers weieht from the molten metal
being added to it. It falls out of the mag
netic field. Its place beinsr taken by fresh
portions of ore from above. The result of
ths operation is said to be agglomerated
coherent masses, ranging in size from a
bean to a walnut, that are tough and por.
ous. differiner In no way from the orÂ«
prior to its agglomeration. The product Is
then in good condition for use in the blast
furnaces.
According to letters received by Mi M.
Ogden, the assays of samples of Califor
nia ore taken East by Mr. .Wolf have
assayed 67.20 iron, entirely free from sul
phur or phosphorus., The ore at Lebanon
contains only 45 per cent- of ; iron and car
ries sulphur. The ore handled for'Schaen
at his plant at Moise shows only 25 per
cent of Iron. Some time has been con
sumed in looking about for a site i for a
mill. Mr. Ogden says that several sites
have been offered.. The manufacture of
steel rails, .mining . machinery and all
forms of structural steel in this city is
regarded as a part of the scheme in view.
One advantage, that is claimed over many
sections is ' the . abundance of cheap oil

Attorney Stidger told Detective Dillon
that Mrs. Lorene Jones was living on
Thirty-eighth street, near Telegraph ave
nue, Oakland, about three months ago,
but that was the last he heard of her.
Detective Dillon was detailed to make
Inquiry, and yesterday he reported his
findings. He found that Jones and the
young woman calling herself his wife
rented rooms at 628 Montgomery street
from Attorneys Stldger & Stidger, where
he sold his patent medicine. On June 7
last he made a will, leaving all his prop
erty to his alleged wife, Lorene Jones,
consisting of $1100 in the Hibernia Bank,
furniture valued at $100 and his patent
for medicine, valued at another $100. and
mining interests, which, however, Stidger
& Stidger could not find any trace of. The
will . was witnessed by S. H. Brooks and
acknowledged before H. S. Foote, notary
public It was probated in Judge Dunne's
court, and after paying off all bills the
property was given to Mrs. Lorene Jones.
Jones died at St. Joseph's Home on June
21 while suffering from delirium tremens,
and the cause of his death was given as
chronic alcoholism. His body was cre
mated in Odd Fel ows' Cemetery. He was
60 years of age and a native of Ken
tucky.
Left Property to Irorens.
This letter was followed by one from
Clements & Clements, attorneys, West
Union, Iowa. They wrote that Jones was
married April 14. 18*4. to Miss Lorlnda
Conrad^nd lived with her till November
15. 1300. That day she left him to visit
friends In Clermont. Iowa, and Jones left'
for St. Louis. In May last Jones left St.
Louis for this city, taking with him Lo
rene Veitt, a grirl "2Q years of age, and it
was claimed that they had been married
in Oakland on arriving there. The real
Mrs. Jones and her husband had visited
this city on a former occasion and she be
came acquainted with'a Mrs. S. M. Dyer,
who now lives in Decoto. Alameda Coun
ty, and -p. Mrs. Huls. When these ladies
learned Jthat Mr. and Mrs. Jones were in
this city they called, but were surprised
to fin<{fthe young woman, who said she
was now Mrs.- Jones. Mrs. Jones No. 2
sent for her brother, who was supposed
to be her husband, and he lived with
them. When Jones left St. Louis for this
city he had $2000 and the patent for his
medicine. It was believed that he owned
mines and other property.
Former Friends Surprised.
Last December Chief Wittman received
a letter from Mrs. J. P. Jones of Arling
ton. Fayette County, Iowa, asking- him to
make inquiry about her husband. She
said she last heard from him on May 17,
but in July she received a letter from. Dr.
P. H. Alpiza of this city asking if her
husband had any property, as it was pro
posed to form a company to manufacture
his patent medicine. She also asked If she
could procure employment sis a | seam
stress if she came here.
The police have unearthed a skeleton in
the closet of the late James P. Jones, a
vender of patent medicines, who died here
last June, leaving a supposed widow of
twenty summers to mourn his loss. It
was given out at -the time of his death
that his wealth in mines was enormous,
but it now appears that his supposed
wealth was all a myth.

In New York the Watterson speech has not been
received with anything like the favor it has met in
the South. The New York leaders are .free traders
and dislike Gorman. on that score as well as on ac-.
count of his surrender to Bryanism in 1896. Theyare
now grooming for the race a dark horse in the per
son of Judge Parker of the Court* of Appeals. Par
ker is said to be quite different from Gorman in
every respect, and a recent review of his career says:
"He is, easily one. of the most eminent Chief Justices,
that ever presided over the.Coiirt. o| Appeals of the
State of New York, a man of excellent character and
of first-rate abilities in other activities than those of
his profession. He has proved his great popularity'
in the State by carrying it against a popular Repub
lican the year-after Bryan's first defeat. The sugges
tion of Parker is admirable, while that of Gorman is
intolerable. to any gold or Cleveland Democrat. Such
a Democrat cannot forget Mr. Gorman's treachery to
Mr, Cleveland when the latter was trying to repeal '
the Sherman silver act of 1893, or his disloyalty to
the tariff policy; of the party in 1894;" y
The beginning of this rivalry between Gorman and
the supporters of ; Parker is the .' morei interesting be
cause there are many other . signs Â¦ of a .widening
divergence between Northern and Southern Democ
racy, and before the coming of ' 1904 it may amount
to such vast proportions as to, break "the solid South/
to pieces and put an. end to- that old sectionalism for
ever. . Mr. Watterson's plea for harmony : and his def
nunciation of all who talk of the old strife has had
no , other effect . than that of disclosing an increasing
strife. In fact, the Chicago split seems ; to be beyond
repair, and neither .Gorman nor Parker- is likely to
be able 1 to bring the factions \ together.
The; suggestion of Gorman is the more. impre%sive
because the Democracy of the South is rapidly de
claring for him:. He is a protectionist, but the South
no longer defends free trade except in an academic
way, and her statesmen are not going .> to turn aside
from Gorman just because he infused a modicum of
protection into the Wilson -tariff. He is a gold Demo
crat, but lie did not bolt Bryan, and that is an attrac
tive record, from a' Southern point of view, for a con
siderable number of influential men in that section
have the same kind of apolitical history.
HENRY: WATTERSON'S "get together"
speech.at the dinner of Virginia Democrats at â¢
Washington a few days ago has caused some
thing of a thrill throughout the party. When re
duced to its last analysis the speech consisted of
three assertions and one insinuation. The assertions
are: First, any Democrat who praises Bryan,'de
nounces Bryan, talks of Bryan, is false to Democ
racy. Second, any Democrat who praises Cleveland,
denounces Cleveland or talks of Cleveland is false to
Democracy. Third, any Democrat who refuses to
join in a platform denying both the old leaders and
ignoring the old issues is false to Democracy. The
insinuation, that exudes from every sentence of the
speech is that the man to get together for and to
stand in with is Gorman of Maryland.
GORMAN OR PARKER.
The War Department at Washington is said to be
asking the railway companies why they, cannot give
as cheap transportation to a troojp of soldiers as to a
theatrical troupe, and the answer will probably be
that in each case the roads fix the rate at as much as
the traffic will bear. . : :. <Â¦-.;_ .' ,
Since the need of the measure is imperative and
urgent, arid since. the postponement of it. is threat
ened, it will be well for Boards of Trade and Cham
bers of Commerce and other commercial or indus
trial organizations to renew their demands upon Con
gress for prompt attention to it Our foreign trade i s
expanding rapidly, and with it our annual tribute to
foreign ship-owners for carrying our imports and
exports rapidly augments. The time .has come for
tis to carry our own ocean commerce* and Congress
should not be permitted to ignore the need of legis
lation helpful to that cn<*
The opposition comes mainly from representatives
of the interior States. Possibly those men are un
able to see what their States and their constituen
cies would gain by an increase of American ship
ping, but if so they must have a purblind statesman
ship. Even Buncombe County will profit something
by, any measure which . increases facilities for trans
porting the Buncombe products to. foreign markets.
The bill is not at all sectional. It ddes not confer
any exclusive benefit upon the seaboard States. .Its
far-reaching effects will . carry benefits not ;bnly, . to.
every State but to every farm that grows produce ipr.
foreign consumption. - "Â¦Â¦Â¦-. .'Â¦â¢ 1 .'--"â¢ â¢Â¦â¢
Over and over again bills designed for the promo
tion of our ocean shipping have been defeated by one
means or another. It is many years since the Repub
lican party first pledged itself to enact legislation for
the advancement of our merchant marine, and
of late such declarations have been given a
conspicuous place not only in platforms but in
arguments of Congressional and Presidential
campaigns. The platform adopted at Phila
delphia declares: "Our present dependence , upon
foreign shipping for nine-tenths of our foreign
carrying is a great loss to the industry of this coun
try. It is also a serious danger to our trade, for its
sudden withdrawal in the event of European war
would seriously cripple our expanding foreign com
merce. The national defense and naval efficiency of
this country, moreover, supply a compelling reason
for legislation which will enable us to recover our
former place among the trade-carrying fleets of the
It is certainly a strange thing that Congressmen
who made their canvass upon that platform should*
now be found in the ranks of the Democratic and
foreign opposition to the enactment of a measure de
signed to carry out the Republican pledge.
While such reports are discouraging, they are not
surprising, nor should they have any other effect than
that of rousing the advocates of the bill throughout
the country to bring renewed pressure upon Con
gress for prompt and favorable action. The forces
opposed to the upbuilding cf the American merchant
marine are well known. They include every foreign
steamship company, every American agency repre
senting such companies, every foreign manufacturer
who profits by advantages granted by the subsidized
steamship lines of his country, every banker who
finances foreign merchants or foreign steamships,
and every narrow American who is opposed to com
mercial expansion and. has no patriotic desire to see
the American flag restored to its former prestige
upon ths ocean. These forces are able to maintain
at the capital a strong and expert lobby, and, as past
experience has shown, the lobby knows how to earn
its pay.
t~V ESPITE the strength- of the â¢ majority by
| 1 which the merchant marine bill was adopted
Â¦*â * in the Senate, and the general expectation
that the House would follow the lead, it appears the
outlook for attaining this long needed legislation is
by no means bright. The opposition in the House
has proven more formidable than was suspected, and,
according to Washington dispatches, it is quite prob
able the passage of the measure may be indefinitely
postponed, if not absolutely defeated.

. Books printed in the English language

to turn their attention to some interna

What is more, this alert Oriental boasts
that his edition is much cheaper than the

<v- It will be .creditable to .us if wcaccept this analysis
; of the situation, and our burdens will be better borne
when we' do. .
Looking at it in perspective > from the standpoint
of our freedom we conceived that Spanish policy in
the Philippines inhered in Spain's monarchical abso
lutism. But stepping into Spain's shoes we learn that
it originated in the cherished aspiration of the people
for independence. So we fall heir to a situation
nearly three centuries old, an aspiration transmitted
from generation to generation and gathering strength
in the blood of men revered. as patriots and martyrs
by the people in whose behalf they fell. Evidence
of this does not come from parties originally, and
now, adverse to our occupancy of the Philippines,
but exists in the statutes enacted there by our author
ity .-and in the means necessary for their enforcement.
A perfectly calm review of our Philippine situation
seems to disclose the fact that the objection of the
Filipinos to Spanish rule was their long smoldering
aspiration for independence, blown into a blaze by
the, immortal patriot, Rizal. Their objection to
American rule appears to be exactly the same as that
to Spanish rule. It appears, also, that we have re
sorted of necessity to the same methods found
necessary by Spain to hold the people in check. In
other words, the situation is not - changed because
we, are involved in it. It takes on no different tone
or color bfcause this is a republic. Although a re
public we cannot permit the habeas corpus in the
Philippines, nor presentment by a Grand Jury, nor
trial by a petit jury;.. We cannot permit immunity of
husband from testimony by a wife, nor wife to im
munity from testimony by husband. We must com
pel each to incriminate the other under most griev
ous penalties. Here independence is the most inspir
ing theme of all. our literature. There it must be
treated as a crime to be harshly punished. Here we
are free, openly or secretly, to promote political poli
cies. There it must be repressed by heavjt fine? and
sore imprisonment.
An English officer from Burmah', recently sojourn
ing in Manila, said that our methods in the Philip
pines are too gentle, and if we used means sufficiently
harsh the islands could soon be subjugated. He then
recounted some of the Burmese methods, consisting
of locating military stations every twenty-five miles,
from which the natives were struck every time they
grew restless and disobedient. Four years of this had
quieted them. The work done from such military
posts was left to be inferred.
"I- do not?; believe that in the history of ," hjiman
cruelty such a law has been applied anywhere. in the
case of one people undertaking to subjugate another
people by conquest when a whole people believe they,
are entitled as of right to their liberty and indepen
dence. This law is to be put in execution by alien
authority, by courts, not by juries, paid by an alien
power and responsible to alien direction and com-
Commenting -upon this, Senator Hoar said" in the
Senate: "Under this provision a wife knowing what
is alleged to be the treason of a husband, or a hus
band knowing it of a wife, or a mother of a son, 'or
a son of his mother, or his father or brother, and not
acting as informer, under a law imposed by. the au
thority of the United States is to be punished by
seven years' imprisonment.'
"Every person resident in the Philippine Islands
who levies war against' them or adheres to their.ene
mies, giving them aid or comfort within the Philip
pine Islands, or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and
shall suffer death, or, in the discretion of the court,
imprisonment at hard labor for five years arid a fine
of $10,000." It is then provided that any one'know
ing any of the acts recited in the. foregoing section
who does not' disclose them to the authorities is
guilty of misprision of treason and shall be impris
oned seven years and fined $1000.
Among other things this statute provides that any
person who shall belong' to "any secret society hav
ing for its object the promulgation of any political
opinion or policy" shall be fined $1000 and impris
oned one year. "Any person who advocates, orally,
or in writing, or printing, or by like methods, the
independence of the Philippine Islands, whether by
peaceable or forcible means," shall be fined $2000 and
imprisoned one year.
Â¦ During his testimony before the Senate Committee
Mr. Barrows, one of the American Governors in the
Philippines, said under oath that those people had
long cherished the idea of independence and had
fought for it, and should not be expected to surreri-;
der it at once. In view of this the Philippine . laws
become of interest to the American people. Among
them is a statute entitled "An act defining the crimes
of treason, insurrection, sedition, conspiracies .. to
commit such crimes, \ seditious utterances, whether
written or spoken, "the formation of secret political
societies, the administering or taking of oaths to
commit crimes or to prevent discovery of same and
the violation of oaths of allegiance, and prescribing
punishment therefor. By authority of the President
of the United States, be it enacted by the Philippine
Commission."
These oaths' went beyond mere participation in-re
bellion, and searched out sympathy with any one in
rebellion. . Thus a daughter who followed with- her
affectionate solicitude her father fighting for the
Confederacy was compelled to deny it under oath or
be disqualified to. teach. school, .have employ
ment or even earn her bread as. a trained nurse. Un
der this law a priest was arrested for shriving the
dying' and a woman foi nursing the â¢ sick without
purging themselves of sympathy with the rebellion
or any engaged in it by taking these test oaths. When
their cases reached the Supreme Court, the whole ma
lign machinery was destroyed by that bench, and
civil liberty was vindicated. ' j '.Â¦ . Â¦Â¦[ .
AT the close of our Civil, War 'certain drastic
provisions crept into the statutes 'and consti
tutions of some of 'the. States- that 'had/ been' in
rebellion. The most noted of these, which,! falling
before the Supreme Court ; of the : - United States,
dragged all others with them, ; were the provisions of
the Drake constitution of Missouri. These, provided
a set of heart-searching test oaths in regard to par
ticipation in rebellion or knowledge of such parti
cipation by others, no matter what degree of kinship
existed between the parties. A father was .compelled
to inform on the son, the son on the father, the wife
on the husband, and brother upon brother.
THE. PHILIPPINE LAWS.
ISSUE OF GERMAN POSTAL CARDS
AS SOUVENIRS OF PRINCE'S ViSIT
How far such a system of control would increase
the efficiency of the army and lessen the friction be
tween the army and the 'War Department is ques
tionable. The navy is administered by such a staff,
and yet there seems to be as much friction between
that service and the Navy Department as there is
between the commanding general and the War
Office. Moreover, the people will remember that the
naval campaign in the West Indies was conducted
by the general staff from Washington, and that
Dewey, after the victory at Manila, cut the cable and
managed things thereafter in his own way. It may
be that Dewey was as wise as he was valiani
. Another argument of Miles against the measure was
that it would subject^the army', to the personal favor
itisnr of Presidents, and would render it possible to
rapidly advance a subordinate over. the : heads of the
highest officers of the arniy. There is doubtless good
foundation for the objection. The bill provides that
the general staff shallH>e composed of a chief of staff,
who shall be detailed by. the President to serve. four,
years and who shall be selected from officers not
below the rank of brigadier general; one major gen
eral, one brigadier, general, four colonels, six lieuten
ant colonels and. twelve majors. ' It also provides that
after the retirement of General Miles the senior gen
eral ; officer of the army may be made chief of the
general staff or assigned to any 'duty the President
may direct. . ,
-.The bill is said to.', have been based upon a study
of German military organization. General Miles de :
nouhced.it as "an imperial system," and perhaps it
is, but. for all that' it- might prove 'much better than
that which has comeMown to us from the days of
Washington. This country is in no danger of: falling
a prey to a military dictator, and there is no reason
for opposing a measure merely because it would add
to the efficiency of the army as a war machine!' " , .
'Â¦The army of the United States is now and. has
beerr ever since the foundation of the republic under
civilian, control. There has been always more or. less
friction, and it will be .remembered that when I Gen- ' :
era l Sherman was commanding general of the army,
he moved his headquarters from Washington to St.
Louis for the purpose, it was said, of fric
tion with thcyWar Department. If the generals have;
felt tlie friction annoying, the War Department has :
been equally sensitive', and the general , staff bill has
been devised, according to report, largely for the
purpose of providing^rnachinery that will work more
smoothly than the present system..
â¢ The question of army controf is one of compara
tively little: interest; to the^ public. " _~ Our -: army is
small, and, except in. time of war, it : 'does ' riot cut
much; figure 'in â¢American life. Moreover, it has been
so carefully kept out ; of politics that there is a dis
position to dismiss ; arniy affairs- from; politics; alto
gether, ' and when any legislation respecting ; military
affairs is under consideration, it is generally left to
experts and: the public accepts whatever' they say.
In this case the .experts differ. : There has been a
wrangle between the head of the army and the .War
Department, and the strife has naturally awakened
popular curiosity? to know what it is all about.
in this case, however, that he has the Support not
only of the -commanding general of the' army,- but : of
a strong. element among the; people as well.

buy transportation in book form that will
be recognized by all roads west of the
Mississippi River.' These books will Â»Â»e

has been : all , used the purchaser of the
book -will receive $25 rebate by applying
at the railroad office where he bought tne

AJ VERTISEMENTS.
THE STRENUOUS LIFE
A Great Strain.
No one disputes the fact that we are
living In a "rapid" age; it is rush, rush,
rush from morning until night, and com-
petition is so fierce that the struggle does
not cease until the machine is worn out.
Women, too, even when .surrounded 'by
every comfort, become infected by the
common spirit, and what with their clubs 1
and many social duties, have no time to
give thought to their physical well-being,
until they are suddenly brought to a
sharp realization of the fact that noth-
ing in their lives is so important as at-
tention to correct, or rational living. It
may surprise the readers to learn that
women are more prone to piles than men,
and in most cases, because it is difficult
to impress upon them the importance of
regular movements of the bowels; irregu-
larity means straining at stool, and
straining means piles, with the certainty
(under the usual methods of treatment)
that the sufferer will "have them always
with her;'.' by "usual methods" is meant
the application of salves and lotions, or
(as a last resort) a surgical operation. If
there is a complaint which entails more
distress and suffering upon those afflicted
than piles or hemorrhoids, it Is not
known to the writer; fortunately, how-
ever, these are learning that there is a
remedy that effectually cures all forms
of piles; It is known as the Pyramid Pile
Cure, is in suppository form, is applied
directly to the parts, and does its work
quickly and painlessly; it is sold by drug-
gists for fifty cents a package, or will be
mailed by the makers to . any address,
upon receipt of price. Mrs. John H. Cas-
tona, 2942 Arch street, Chicago, says: "I
must write you that I was cured of a
very aggravating . case of itching and
bleeding piles . by â¢ the use of the great
remedy, Pyramid Pile Cure, even after
several physicians had claimed' there was
no cure except by an operation. I am
well now, and owe all to this valuable
remedy. I cannot say 'enough for it."
Write the Pyramid Drug. Co., Marshall,

DOCTORS ENDORSE HERPICIDE
Because Its Formula Is Submitted to
Them.
Alexander McMilllan. M. D. f a promi-
nent physician of Lansing, Mich., writes:
"On three' cases I have tested Herpiclde
for dandruff and the result has been all
that could be desired."
Herpiclde Is made upon an entirely new
principle, that Is, that dandruff and fall-
Ins hair are caused from a microbe that
Infests the hair bulb, and, by destroying
the microbe one's hair Is bound to grow
luxuriantly. Herpiclde is the only hair
remedy that claims to and really does
destroy the dandruff germs. ___^

All the way up Golden : Gate avenue
cabby did what other, drivers have been
doing for the past three weeksâ trying to
find a Bmooth roadway to travel upon.
The storm on Tuesday morning' filled the
holes with water ,and horses floundered
about In the breakers. A small, boy used
the "chain of lakes" to sail his boat. A
well-known citizen living on Golden Gate
avenue, between Hyde. and Larkln, has
applied to the. Supervisors for 'permission

Golden Gate avenue is supposed to be a
boulevard, but the Board of Public Works
has* forgotten that such a street exists'.
Never in the history of the city has a
street been in a more wretched condition.
In the dark the ruts loom up like the
shafts of an abandoned mine. The horses
fear to travel over the dangerous ground;

a committee consisting of Colonel Thomas
F. O'Neil and Colonel John. F. Connelly
of the First California Infantry, Captain
Thomas Costello of the regular army vol
unteers and Captain Dennis Geary and
Charles G. Austin of the California Heavy
Artillery was appointed to take measures
to urge the passage of one of the bills

The committee ha3 prepared a petition to
Congress which may be found at the quar

and Gough streets; at the artillery quar
ters, 815 Ellis street, and at 630 Market
street. They request all ex-volunteers,
both of the regular army and of the Stata

Philippine Islands after April 12, 1S99, to
call at once at one of the above places
and sign the petition, as it is desired to

With his hands manacled after the fash

has started out from Bakersfield
to make a- trip around the world.
Herman ' Is not attempting this
rather extraordinary trip in expiation of
any crime that h* has committed, nor is
it being made because he enjoys walking
with his hands bound in -this peculiar
fashion, but to win a wager of JlOuO. The
conditions of this strange wager require
that he start on the journey penniless
and that the handcuffs are only to be re
moved from his wrists when. he is about
to retire to his nightly rest. Then thev
are to ".be" unlocked by the proprietor of

TRAVELS HANDCUFFED
TO WIN A BIG WAGEH
.A well-known horseman- took a day off
yesterday to count the holes in one block
in order to make his complaint to the
Board of Works good and strong. He
started out valiantly, but before he had
counted thirty square feet he was seized
with dizziness and had to quit. And
others have had the same experience.
On the first Sunday; in April the em
ployes of the J. Noonan Furniture Com
pany will enjoy an outing at San Pedro,
through the kindness of Mrs.- Noonan;
who bears, the expense of the trip. Mr3.
Noonan has always- kept in "close touch
with her people by her watchful care and
interest in their welfare and well being.
Her generosity in so many instances has
greatly endeared her to them. Such kin-1
ly treatment tends to make life sweeter
and better, and if all emplovers were as
considerate and thoughtful we would sel
dom, hear of strikes or, labor troubles of
any description.' To this in a measure
may be ascribed her great success as a
business woman, added to her dignified
and business-like attention to every de
tail of the great business she so success
fully controls.

RENO, New, April S.â The last dispute
between the San Pedro road and the Ore
gon Short Line over" a' right of way
through Nevada has been settled. The
field work-of the joint sHrvey has been
agreed upon throughout. All that now
remains Is for. the engineering depart
ments of both roads to complete their
maps. . These must be . approved by the
boards of directors, and then the legal
department* must go 'to court and secure
an order flnaity determining the right of
way W each road. It is believed that
this can be accomplished by May, 1, and
then the construction work will proceed.
Assistant Chief Engineer H. M. Mc-
Cartney of the San Pedro and "Resident
Engineer William Ashton of the Short
Line held a conference, at which they
went over the sole remaining point In dis
pute and agreed on a solution. At one
location, not far from Moapa, Utah, the
roads skirt the foothills. The Short Line
has the more desirable line, well up on
the side, leaving the San Pedro some dif
ficult and expensive work. This was ob
jected to. Chief Engineer J. B. Eerry and
Ashton finally agreed in behalf of the
Short Line that a middle route should be
selected, both roads sharing in the, ex
pense and building practically a double
track alone this section, of road.
The joint survey agreed upon " covers
oyery part of the country .where a con
flict of interests from an engineering
standpoint is possible. It extends from
Pioche, New, to Calientes, thence in a
southwesterly and southerly direction
through tiie Meadows Valley wash and
\egas Valley. Bird Springs Pass, be
yond \ egas Valley, was also surveyed
for each road. The distance covered is 115
rniles. The country at both ends of the
joint survey is open and both roads will
oe free to select their routes without any
prospect of a conflict.- There is a crossing
near Bolter Summit, but this is not a
prace, so there is scant prospect of any
further dispute between the two roads as
to the right of way.

The matter of "the- expense account > is
also made the basis -for. a separate charge

have spent, in the last three "years the
sum of $16,000 for which he has turned
in no vouchers: whatever, and "that he
makes no explanation of the expenditure
except that-lt was for "expense incurred

There Is crooked work somewhere. It seems
to raÂ« as though the Sheriff's force In Wichita
is guilty of criminal neglect. If nothing else.
Several days ago I was informed that Dunn
wan a desperate character and was In all
probability only shamming sickness in thÂ« ,
"Wichita Hospital. I Immediately Â¦ ordered
Sheriff Simmons to place a strong guard In
the hospital and not let Dunn have any chance
of escape. Why this was not done, I propose
to find out. If .the officers were guilty of neg
lect of duty In the matter or aided in the es
cape they- will, have to suffer the penalty.
. Day before yesterday a prominent lawyer of
Southern Kansas, one noted In State politics,
cam* to my chief detective. Mr. Sutton. and
proposed | to ' Kim " that , If . .when he go t the re
ward for J. P. Dunn he- would ylve certain par
ties in this city $1COO. all hindrances to the
transfer of Dunn to the Arkansas authorities
would bÂ« removed. My detective refusing, the
proposition was made to me. I I will place this
matter In full before the Attorney General to
morrow as well as other things tending to show
'rottenness In .the matter.. I have reason to
know that the envoy, represented, a prominent
official here.. .... ; - 'Â¦
TOPEKA, Kans., April 3.â Governor
Stanley and Attorney General Godard
went to Wichita to-night to investigates
the escape of Dunn. Some interesting de
velopments are expected, as the State of
ficers are of the opinion that the Wichita
authorities had something to do with the
escape. Governor Stanley said to-night:
Chlqf Burt said to-night:
. Dunn -asked the house physician Tues
day night to name hi*; price for allowing
him to escape, saying that he had bribed
the guards and that he alone stood be
tween him and liberty. Â¦Â¦', Physician Clarke
refused.- It is thought 1 that a friend of
Dunn's grot 4nto the hospital in the gulso
of a patient and facilitated his escape late
in the night. Every door In the hous*
was locked this morning. . The police
force and Sheriff's force are charging
each other with planning the escape of
Eunn. Mayor McLean has telephoned
Governor ; Stanley and Attorney General
Gobard to come to- Wichita to Investigate
the matter. .

A match between boxers Britt and
Parker seems an assured fact. The Den
ver boxer is anxious to meet , the Cali
fornian and the latter has expressed his
willingness to make the match. It should
be an easy matter for one of the clubs in
this city to bring them together.
Parker has proved his ability as a boxer
and the manner in which Britt put Heg
arty away speaks volumes for his hitting
ability. There is every, reason to believe
the â¢ two lightweights â¢ would draw a big
house. This condition win prevail until
Britt meets his master or reaches the goal
of his ambition, the lightweight cham
pionship. NSfemHMM

ON TELEGRAPH HILL
This is the ultimatum of the champion.
He still insists the Los Angeles offer is
the better, but has come to the conclusion
"Fitz" will not fight on this coast.-:
The Los Angeles Club has $25,000 on de
posit and agrees to forfeit it in case It
is unable to promote the fight. ' 'Under
these conditions Jeffries feels warranted
in securing some sort of a guarantee that
he will be repaid for any expenses he may
be under in training to defend the cham-.
pionship In, the East.
Jeffries is afraid of interference from
the authorities; of South Carolina," while
he is sure there will be none in this State.
Â¦ If the Charleston Athletic Club will de
posit 510,000 in responsible hands and will
agree to forfeit that amount to the boxers
if it fails to promote the championship,
boxing contest Jeffries will agree to fight
Fitzsimmons under its auspices.

The need of an all-night service was

; : V RTHUR HOLLAND, who is in the Â¦
i\ city as the, .representative of
iLj\ Brown Brothers, the bankers,; of
A jjL -New York, through '.whom the
purchase of the Market, "gutter,
Sutro and San Mateo street car systems
was; effected, in discussing :theSPla.ns of_
the ; new -corporation, so far Â¦ as the ' em
bryo condition of affairs /allowed, said
yesterday: .
, "I ' am i here for Brown Brothers ,to see
to the- various details arising from the
joining of the various companies under
the control of the new corporation. v The
details | will take some time - to Â¦ work out,
and' we must naturally, familiarize our
selves ' with the personnel ; of ; the staff - of
the old company before : coming to any
decision 'as' to any changes. that may be
deemed necessary. ; I can say, however,
that the tendency is to-make very few'
changes in the personnel of the company,
which is now called the United Railroads
of San Francisco. It will be some time,
indeed, .before things get* into complete
working, order, under the new regime, for Â¦
there i are many details to ; study before
anything Â¦ of a permanent nature can be
determined so far as the details go. The
object of the-new management is. to give
the best I possible service to the city, and
therefore many beneficial changes .will be
made. *It-' will -.take a long while to gain
complete ' knowledge of the conditions and
officials as they now stand." .. â¢ .
' Asked whether Â¦ there was a' probability
of the Geary street system "being merged
into the new corporation, ': Mr. â¢ Holland
said that there was no reason to believe "
the system will be taken over by the cor
poration, i "It is the intention of the com-'
pany,'',he said, "to use more electric pow-'
eri in connection with its system, and,
further,. the employment of new cars will'
depend entirely upon the public require

BERLIN, April 3.â The Government has
been placed in a most awkward position
on, the prohibition of Â»~e import of meats
treated . with boracic acid by a | declara
tion to-day of , the Society for the Protec
tion of the interests of German -Chemical
Industry: that -the Government ' did* not
consult the Imperial Health Council. This
body, ' composed Â¦ of , eminent ' specialists
from all parts of Germany, is advisory to
the Imperial Health Omce. The Govern
ment's : statement in the North ' German
Gazette Saturday affirmed that the 'coun
cil was unanimously -for prohibition.' It
now appears, according to the 'chemical
society, that the matter was never,
brought before the, council. ''

formed ; the * Imperial Secretary of State

a step i had been taken without consult

PAINij'S CELERY COMPOUND.
COMPOUND
Saves Sleepless, Neryous, De-
spondent and Morese Peo-
ple From Insanity.
It is- the Only Effective and
Honest Medicine for the
Banishment of Com-
mon Spring Ail-
ments.
Medical men of the highest standing,
and a host of educated men and women
competent to judge, declare that Paine's
Celery Compound is the only true and er-
fective medicine for the banishment of
the ills that make life miserable in spring-
time. Â¦
In the spring: season tens of thousands
are sleepless, fretful, nervous, despondent
and gloomy. They find it impossible to
obtain restful sleep and soon become
physically exhausted; some are already
mere wrecks of humanity. ,
Such sufferers cannot with safety trifle
with their condition. They need imme-
diate succor and aid .before nature is too
severely overtaxed. The weakened, ex-
hausted and irritated system must be for-
tified at once.
Paine's Celery Compound is the only
agent that can afford the run-down,
nervous, sleepless and despondent victims
prompt relief and permanent cure. If you
are assured of this fact, dear reader, do
not hesitate a moment; putting off will
certainly aggravate your condition and
lead you nearer the grave. If you wisely
determine to test the health-buildins
powers of Paine's Celery Compound, do
not accept a substitute or vile imitation.
Tour special case demands the best; you
are payinj? for it and should get it. Ask
your dealer for PAINE'S, refuse all
others.- See that the name is on the bot-
tle and wrapper. . __^

STOCK AND BOND EXCHANGE.
Â¦; The only fluctuation worthy of note on the
morning session. of the Bond Exchange was an
advance in Pacific Gas to $35 75. The other
stocks were dull. In the afternoon Spring Val
ley Water was higher at $93 25 and Alaska
Packers at $161 75. There was j a sale of Lon
don, Paris and American Bank at $166. There
was active Â¦ trading In bonds.
- The oil stocks have been showing more life
during the past few days. Last week there
was sudden activity In Sterling, owing to the
placing of a contract for 1,500,000 barrels for
Island account, and now Petroleum Center has
become active with sales of thousands of shares
at rising prices, the stock selling yesterday at
9Â®10c. Nobody seems to be able to give any
reason for this rally In Petroleum Center, un
less . It- is the sinking of a new well. At any
rate the chief operator in the stock quietly says
that he is not selling any, put is buying on the
board. - .
A dividend on old Market-street Railway
stock has just been declared for the quarter
ending March 31. The rate Is 60c per share,
the same as heretofore, and the dividend will
be payable on the 10th. -â¢

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The situation In Butter continues unchanged.
Northern orders keep the market from becom

Dairy Exchange yesterday 'received a telegram
from Senator Bard saying that he would vote
for the Oleomargarine bill.
Cheese . remains as before, being weak, with
large stocks. . . * - : .
The lower grades of Eggs are somewhat . off,
and the gap between store and ranch descrip
tions is beginning to widen, as usual at this
time of the year. There have been so many
choice ranch bought up in the country for cold
storage that they are becoming somewhat
scarce, but this condition Is offset, by the ex
cessive supplies of all other grades. Dealers
continue to store what they cannot sell." Â¦ Soms
of them are disposed to quote fine ranch rather
firmer, on account of 'Â¦ the lighter supplies al
luded to just above, but no better prices have

Miss Julia Heinrich was also heard to
particular advantage last night. She has
a lovely voice, fresh, pure, large- apd of
unusual quality, that is yet not quits set
tled. There is also decided temperament
and good schooling, and Miss Julia, young
as she is, is distinctly a singer to be
reckoned with. She sang last night a
group of four songs by Emil A. Brnguiere
of San Francisco with considerable per
sonal success, and also new laurels for
Mr. Bruguiere, the compositions, readily
melodious, thoughtful and sincere. meet-
Ing with well-deserved applause. The duet
singing of Mr. and Miss Heinrichs in its
complete sympathy is a constant pleas
ure, and the Schumann and Goring Thom
as numbers were given with their usual
delightful appreciation of emotional val
ues. On Saturday afternoon the third and
possibly last programme will be givenâ a
brilliant and novel programme, to include
eleven of the Richard Strauss songs, two
Dvorak numbers and two Brahma songs,
besides others.
There was a gratifying enthusiasm and
a fair sized house last night at Sherman
& Clay Hall on the occasion of the sec
ond Heinrich recital. An Interesting pro
gramme, was given and the singers were
both in excellent form. Mr. Heinrich was
heard in some of his inimitably rendered
German ballads, that made their custom
ary irresistible appeal to the audience.
He has a strong gift of humor and of
getting the emotional atmosphere of a
song, and is musicianly in the highest de
gree. Mr. Heinrich's accompaniments are
a delightful feature of the performance,
recalling Mr. - Henschel's work of the
kind, but are even more sympathetic and
spirited.

and Miss .Lee were acquainted prior to
the, robbery. ,. This, closed the testimony.

mer District Attorney. Ernest Weyancl,
City Trustee Owen Sullivan and J. M.
Scroggin. all of Colusa County, testified
that Galvin's- record was of the best. All
admitted, however, that. they knew noth
ing of his acts after leaving Colusa.
. The defendant next took the stand.% He
was .nervous and answered the questions
put to him in a trembling voice. He told
of his life at.Colusa, where he lived until
he was 18 years of age. Three years ago
he came, to, San Francisco. He was a
stone sawyer by trade, but having broken
his arm- accidentally, he found it necessary
to.seek otherand lighter employment. On
the day of the . robbery, he said, . he â¢ re
tired at 3-, p. m. and did not rise until
10:30 p. m., when his brother . awakened
him. . On. leaving * his home he went to
Hopkins" saloon, drank with Kearney and
Hopkins; and then went to Nash's saloon,
Joseph Kearney, a check clerk* in the
employ of the Southern Pacific and liv
ing at 131 Eddy street, testified that; he
met and drank with Galvin at. the saloon
of William Hopkins, 131 Eddy street,
about 11:15 o'clock on the night of -the
robbery. Galvin was in a hurry, and on
his statement that he wanted to go-" to

All this time Miss Oliver was working
at the Sunset office, but she quit writing
at Rumble's dictation last Saturday. Then
came the denouement which led to the
appearance in court of Rumble yesterday
and the rejrir.-and and his threatened ar
rest for perjury. Jordan's attorneys hunt
ed up Miss Oliver and succeeded in get
ting her deposition in which she said she
wrote the Allington letter and presented
the same to Judge Murasky. When Lie
matter came up before the Judge yester
day Rumble was sanguine that he was
safe from further inquiry, but Miss Oli
ver s presence in the courtroom puzzled
him. When she was placed on the wit
ness stand and told how she wrote the
letter which Rumble claimed had been
written by Mrs. Allington- he displayed a
great deal of fear and tried to brazen the
matter out by branding Miss Oliver as
a liar. He was very quickly told, how
ever by the court, that In this case her
word would be taken in preference to his.
I am satisfied." said Murasky "that
the young lady has told the truth. You
nave attempted to deceive the court, and
if the evidence was sufficient to meet the
statute on perjury I would cause you to
be prosecuted. As I am in doubt, I will
take no action, but I now order you to
show your books to Mr. Jordan at once "
A few weeks ago W. EC Jordan, a
stockholder in the corporation, applied to
the Superior Court for an order directing
Rumble to appear in court with the com
pany's books, so that he could find out
lor himself how the corporation was pro
gressing. The order was issued by Judge
Murasky and Rumble made his appear
anee, but without the books. He told the
Judge that the books were in the posses
sion of Mrs. K. E. Allington of Rochester.
N. Y.. president of the company, and that
in consequence they could not be pro
duced here. He showed the court a letter
purporting to have been written by Mrs.
Allington. in which reference to the books
was made in such a way that the court
was led to believe that they were not in
this State. Rumble was given a lecture
on the propriety of obeying court orders
and told of the dangers surrounding con
tempt proceedings, and the matter was
continued.
George W. Rumble, secretary of the
Sunset Gold Mining Company, will never
again put his trust in any young lady
whom he selects to do his typewriting. Ha
trusted Miss Flora Oliver of 1441 Clay
street, who wrote all Uie letters that in
formed the pubflc ofwihe existence of
Rumble and the mining company and as
a result received a very severe reprimand
from Judge Murasky yesterday. Mlsa
Oliver possesses a cftscience, and to
this conscience is due Rumble's downfall
and the exposure of a scheme on his part
to prevent a stockholder of the company
gazing on the books in which are record
ed the debits and credits of the concern.
Morrill failed to get his divorce on the
ground of desertion and tne action was
dismissed. \\ ithin a month a second suit
was filed and Mrs. Morrill was charged
with desertion and lnfide'iity. Tnis suit
she alleges, came like a thunderbolt from
a clear Eky and she determined to do a
little suing herself. Hence Mrs. Wiseman
is made plaintiff in a suit for damages for
the theft of a husbands affections.
ilrs. Morrill's suit for damages Is based
or this action for divorce. She alleges
that the cause of her husband's derelic
tion is an elderly woman named "VYiseman.
She claims that through the machinations
and, plans of Mrs. Wiseman her husband's
affections were weaned from her and that
the suit for divorce was filed at her in
stigation.
Mrs. Morrill alleges that when her hus
band left her in Los Angeles he was at
tracted by Mrs. Wiseman's wealth. Ac
cording to her complaint, Mrs. Wiseman
gave her husband a complete outfit of
wearing apparel and completed her con
quest by taking Morrill on several trips
to the northern part of the State and to
the Klondike, paying all the expenses of
each trip. A voyage to Honolulu on the
steamer Sierra followed their return from
Aiaska, the expense of which was borne
alleges Mrs. Morrill. by Mrs. Wiseman.
They returned from Honolulu in No
vember of last year, alleges Mrs. Mor
rill, and two months after th*ir arrival
Morrill commenced his action for divorce.
Morrill. ghe alleges, wrote to her and
told her that it would be better for them
both to "agree to disagree" and notified
her that he would commence an action
for legal separation. In his letters,
charges Mrs. Morrill. he told her that he
had lately come into a piece of propertv
which had yielded him $1200, and she al
leges he offered to give to her $1000 of
that amount.
They settled in Los Angeles and pre
pared to resume their happy relations.
Then came the first rift in their happi
ness. Morrill came to this city, leaving
lus vrife in the City of Angels to await a
summons from him to come here and es
tablish a permanent home. The summons
i-ever came, at least not the expectsd
summons. A summons to appear and de
fend herself against a charge of deser
tion, preferred against her by her hus
band in an action for divorce, reached
her, however.
For fifteen years the Morrills lived hap
pily together. They were married at
Auburn, Me., in 1S75 and lived a life of
peace and contentment in the Pine Tree
State until a year ago. when they packed
up their belongings, disposed of the little
cotUige and came to California.
Mrs. Xellie F. Morrlll of Los Angeles
has sued Mrs. L. Wiseman, a woman
much older than herself, for $50,000 dam
ages for the alleged alienation of the af
fections of plaintiff's husband.

CLEVER RUSE OF -GIRL .;
TO STEAL 'ARTICLES
The finishing of the trial consumed. the
greater part of the day. The attorneys in
their arguments severely roasted the wit
nesses who were against them. ' Â¦
Daniel Galvin, a brother of : the de
fendant, was the flrst witness called for
the defense. He testified that on the
evening of Mrs. Foote's robbery he saw
his brother lying asleep in a room the
latter shared with John F. Manning .in
thfl Galvin residence at .565 O'Farrell
street. The defendant was a barkeeper in
Judge Lawlor received the verdict. The
people were represented by Barney Flood
of the District Attorney's office when it
was rendered.
Galvin made an attempt to prove an
alibi, but was unsuccessful. The confes
sion of Anita Clark, who pleaded guilty
to her portion of the crime some time
ago, was strong evidence against the de
fendant.
A SINGULAR verdict was rendered
by a jury In Judge Cook's court
late last night. Thomas Galvin,
who was on trial for having
robbed Mrs. Foote in a hotel on
Geary street last December, was. found
guilty .of grand larceny. The indictment
charged robbery, but the Jury for some
unknown reason overlooked the fact that
force had been used, the unfortunate
woman's jaw being broken by the assail
ant and her face horribly beaten in the
struggle to protect her wealth. '
