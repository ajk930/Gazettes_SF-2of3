They had camped out together w th the cli

Maverick "laid" for him at
rodeos, in town on Saturdays,
and came home at all sorts of
unexpected hours. Brandow
never seemed to see him when
they met In a crowd, and they
did not meet elsewhere. It was
not in Maverick Swlmm to shoot
a man in the back. Finally he con
cluded that Brandow's conscience
had turned him religious. From the
hour in which he took possession of
his wife's letter Maverick had been
cold to her and neglectful of her com

She did not awake from the sleep in

into the room where she lay and stood

feature of It on his memory forever. He
got the box In which he kept his receipts,
unlocke* it and tcok out the letterâ that
letter. She should have her love letter in

November night and he did not think it

to neelect it; \ . .:.- V->"
He. dropped the letter into his pocket; a
mirthless, contemptuous smile distorted
his lips. -He hated Brandow for sending
it,' but despised tha- other more for yield
ing it up so tamely. Â¦'Â¦/Â¦ '..'Â¦ -
He knew - his sister Kermit was to . go
with Brandow to the ball that night at
the Fifteen-Mile House;- her dress had
him a cow's worth.
Maverick read the superscription on the
envelope, and ai cold, gray, hue spread
over his face and paled- the sun tan of
his skin. He had thought the letter -was
for his sister, but he read in Brandow's
bold' handwriting. "Mrs. Dolly Swimm."
"God!" His profanity stopped in its own
inefficiency:- This then was the secret of
Brandow's friendshipâ sneaking a letter
to his wife in the face of their quarrel^
He recalled now many incidents that had
had no. meaning to him before. Brandow
had spent days and evenings at his home
âwhen he himself was there and when he
was notâ and he had thought it was for
Kermit. . "God!"â the word came through
his shut' teeth. He made up hia mind at
that moment to shoot Brandow dead if
ever he set foot on his doorstep again.
he did so that it didn't suppose it made
any difference who gave her. the -letter, so
she got It, though he neglected to tell this
to 'Brandow. ' He - wondered as .he rode
away what had' come over Maverick that
he didn't want anybody to see his women
folk; Kermit and - himself had^been to
school together at ( the academy. The
academy, be it known, was built and
maintained by the rich cattlemen for the
education of ..their, young people. The
young man was of " the younger genera-;
ti.op.-s Either Maverick or Brandow in
trusted with a letter like that would have
defended it with/his life. , . .
It came to pass that each man did
build his own fence, as Brandow had
said, the result being a lane a mile and
a half long and not wide enough for two
men to walk abreast in it.
It began at the" point of a jagged spur
of the Sierras and ended at nothing on
the dead level of the plain to the west.
Poppies grew in It and spangled it with
gold. The tall milkweed blossomed there,
and- the wild red clover, the alfllaria grew
rank around the posts of the fences
where the soil had been shoveled up.
Larks made their nests in it and sang
their songs to the blue sky. Maverick
and Brandow never spoke to each other
again. The lane was between them.
. One, two, three, four the years slipped
away, married a stranger and
forgot the old love in a new one.
William Brandow, on that never-forgot
ten night, ceased to attend balls or any
places of amusement. He was still the
tallest and straightest of his fellows; his
blue eyes- had lost none of their bright
ness; but the wavy black locks on his
temples were streaking with gray. - It
was whisDered about him that ho had

It. seemed to her an endless black ribbon

cotton-wood . tree at . â¢ the well and sang,
and whistled, and she and the Â¦ mocking
- ; bird seemed to have the /world to them
'selves. - Brandow did not. come, nor came
to her any word of excuse or reason why.
Because of .it Maverick's rage burned
hotter within him. Kermit lost color and
', appetite as the weeks went by and he
did not come.
Pretty Kermit Swiram came Â¦Â¦ tripping
out into the yard .where he was. Sho

happiness. "Who you loading for now.
Mav?" she stopped her>Â«ong to say, and
gave his ear a tweak as she passed him
by. He : did not reply. She was too full
of -her own gladness to notice the omis
sion, and his broad hat brim hid his sul
len face.
Coming Into ' the big sitting room, which
opened directly Into tbe yard, he struck
his foot against a footstool that was
made of oyster cans set in a circle , and
covered with a piece of carpet cut to fit
the shape of them. Ordinarily he 'would
not have paid any attention to it. but
everything was changed now. He gave
It a vicious kick' and sent it rattling to
the other side of the room. "My life."
he mentally soliloquised, "is just like

tin cans.'* It was the first time he had

went up on the side of the jagged spur of
mountain which Intruded Into the valley,
carrying hla six-shooter In his hand, but
not a squirrel showed Its head. He turned
back toward the west and walked alonjr
the wire fence till he came to the end of
the lane. The brown grass and clover
and milk weeds stood high and thick In
lr from end to end, while all the outside
was grazed to the ground. He went Into
it for the first time since It was built,
hoping to get a shot at' a squirrel, and
tramped until he was tired. Men walked
little In those days. A soft, warm, white
fog. white as a white cloud, began to roll
in from everywhere and close around
him: it shut out the world from bis sight;
so near It came he could almost reach out
and touch Its fleecy whiteness. All the
way from tbe side of the jagged, rocky
hillside he had had a queer. Instinctive
feeling that he was followed. After tha
fog had closed around him he could dis
tinctly hear a stealthy, gliding step on
the dead clover. When ha stopped to listen
It stopped; when he started It started;
while he walked It glided behind Ma hid
den in the fog. Then he heard a tramping
before him; he stopped, and tha tram pin*
that was ahead of him stopped. He wad
not afraid of anything that walked tha
earth, - but the unnaturalness of every
thing and the fog-shrouded silence wore
depressing; besides, he could never find
the way home in It nor kill a squirrel.
Sudden as the changing of a thought the
fog lifted and rolled away, and Maverick
stood face to face with William Bran
dow. Behind him the stealthily gliding
step had changed to a measured srwlah,
swish, swish, as of something moving
back and forth from side to old*. The)
lane was too . narrow for them, to pÂ«-w
side by side; one must turn back or eravwt
through the 'wire fence.
" Maverick, In his old, Imperative way,
motioned Brandow to turn back. Bran
dow gave one startled glance at him and
beyond him, then with a swiftness which
only an eye could follow he caught the
weapon from his side and fired. Maver
ich had but to raise his hand. As the
simultaneous shots rang out he heard a
heavy fall and a struggling on the ground
behind him, and saw Brandow pitch
headlong and lie stretched full length In
ths narrow lane. He waited to fall him
self, vaguely wondering why he did notâ

the King with their backs to tne windows look-
Ing on the courtyard. The noise the thing made
In falling was great, and its weight seemed like
to break the table, making . all. the dishes
Jump, ' though none were oroken, for luck
lly It fell upon, the cloth and - not up
. on tho i dishes. The King, at the blow
it gave, half turned his head and with
out the slightest emotion said, "I believe
those are my fringes." It was in fact a pack
age about the breadth of a priest's bat, tied up
In. a badly made pyramid ' about two feet Ion?.
It was thro wrt from far behind me, through
the two antechambers, and a scrap of. the
fringe getting detached in maldalr, fell on the
King's wig, which Llvry. who was on his left,
saw and lifted off. . He went to the edge of the
table and found it was really, the fringes twist
ed up In a bundle; and we all saw them, as he
did. As Llvry was about to lift the bundle he
saw a note attached to It. He left the bundle
and took the note. , The King held out his hand
for it, saying, "Let me see"; but Livry very
properly would not, and stepping backward
read it, and gave It to Daquin, behind the
King, with whom I read- It as he held It in bis
hands. It was written in a long, feigned hand,
like that of a woman, and said: "Take back
your fringes, Bontems; the trouble was more'
than the pleasure; my kiss-hands to the King."
It was folded, but not sealed. The King wished
to take.lt from Daquin. who drew back, smelt
it. rubbed it. turned it, and returned it, and
then showed it to the King, but would not let
him touch it. The King told him to read It
aloud., and read It himself at tho same time.
"That is .very insolent," eald the Kins; but
he said It In an equable, and, as it were, his-*
torlcal tone. -Then be told them to take away
the package. - Llvry found It 'so heavy that it
nothing. At last tt.e King told the latter to go
and measure it by foot .ale and come and tell
him the result. While he was doing this
Louvols. furious at the proceedings, grumbUd
aloud, crossly declaring that the window was
exactly the tame size as all tho others. The
King said nothing and waited; but he was
plainly displeased. When the measurements
were made he asked Le Notre the result. Le
Notre hesitated. â¢ The King was* angry and or
dered him to speak out. Le Notre then ad
mitted Â¦ that the King was- right by several
inches. He had .scarcely said the words before
the King, turning to Louvois. told him he
could not put up with his obstinacy any longer;
that If it had not been for his own eye that
window would have been crooked and the whole
building must have. been torn down as soon as
finished; In short, he washed his head for him:
Louvols, incensed at this rebuke, given in
the presence of the courtiers, tho workmen and
the valets, went home furious. He there found
Saint-Pouange, Villacerf, the two Tiiladets and
others of his henchmen, who were much alarm
ed to see him in such a state.- "It is all over."
he said to them; "I am ruined with the King
after his treating me In this way about a mere
window. I have' no recourse but a war which
will put building out of Jhla head and make me
necessary to him, and by â he shall have It."
He kept his word, and within a few months, tn
spite of the King and the other powers, war
was general.'
Saint-Simon puts a life and vigor into
his descriptions that is particularly tell
ing in the dramatic narrative of . the
crises In the reign of "Louis and later in"
the' history of France under the regency.
At these times, of course, there is the
danger of bias on the part of the writer,
and his partisanship must be allowed for./
His anecdotes In the nature of court gos
sip are .extremely, amusing and give as
nothing else can a colored and vivid pic
ture of the age and its customs/Here is
a story that he has to tell concerning t'wo
remarkable - robberies from/ the King,
which is one. of the many that gives to
us the inside life at court: .
A very bold robbery took place In the great
like, as was his attitudo toward the Duo
du Maine, son of Louis XIV by his mis
tress Mme. Montespan, and also toward
that remarkable woman. Mme. de Maln
tenon. wife of Louis, still he does them
the justice of acknowledging their good
points and producing their great qualities.
His portraits are vivid and convincing.
Here for example is what he has to say
about the Dauphin Louis. 8on of Louis
XIV and the Infanta Maria Theresa,
called by his father "Monseigneur," a
name given to him in Jest but which in
time came to be his only name:
Monseigneur was tall rather than short, very
stout but not thickset; his air was proud and
lofty, but never harsh; and he would have had
a very agreeable face If the Prince de Contl
(the one who died last) had not broken his nose
by accident, when they were both children. In
playing. He was a very handsome blond, with
a ruddy skin and full cheeks, but with no coun
tenance whatever; the finest legs in the world,
the feet slender and singularly small. He tip
toed in walking, that is. he put his foot down
twice; he was always afraid of falling, and
called for help tf the path was not perfectly
straight and smooth. He looked very well on
horseback and had a noble mien,, but he was
not bold. Casau always rede before him in
hunting. If be 'lost sight of him he. thought
himself lost; would never ride beyond a slow
gallop, and would often wait under a tree to
see what became of the hunt, and then follow
elowly or else Â¦ return home. He had always
been fond of eating, but never with Indecency;
after his great attack of indigestion, which was
thought to be apoplexy, he made but one real
meal a day. and restrained himself muchâ
although a great eater, like the rest of the
royal family. Nearly all his portraits resemble
him.
As for character, he had none; some sense,
but absolutely no mind; haughty and dignified
by nature, by deportment and by copying the
king; obstinate beyond nature, with a series of
regulated pettinesses that made the tissue. of
his life; gentle from laziness and a sort of stu
pidity; hard at bottom, with an external kind
ness shown chiefly to subalterns and valeta. and
only expressed In common ways.. With them
he was extremely familiar; insensible, how
ever, to the misery and sorrow of others, which
was, perhaps, mere the result of his careless
ness and Imitation than from hardness of na
ture; incredibly silent, consequently very secret,
so much so that people thought he had never
upoken of state affairs to the Choinâ perhaps
because neither could understand them. Den
sity on the one hand, timidity on the other, put
a reserve into this Prince which has few ex
amples; at the same time he was vainglorious
to excess, which Is "an odd thing to say of a
Dauphin; very exacting of respect, and almost
solely solicitous and occupied about what was
due to him. He once said to Mile. Choin, who
spoke to him of his silence, that the words of
men In his position had great weight and com
pelled great reparations if they were not very
cautiously measured, and for that reason he
often preferred to keep silence rather than to
speak. Also, It was easier done for his laziness
and Indifference. This excellent maxim, which
be exaggerated in practice, was apparently one
of the lessons given him by the Kins or the
Due de Montausler which he had best retained.
His methodical arrangement of all his pri
vate affairs was extreme; be himself wrote
down all his items of expense. He knew what
the slightest thing cost him, ', though he spent
Immensely on buildings, fumltfcre. Jewels-of all
kinds, trips to Meudon. and his wolf-hunting
equipment, for be had made himself believe
that be liked to bunt. He was fond of all sorts
of heavy play, but after ho began to build ho
reduced himself to moderate stakes. In othor
respects, miserly beyond ail propriety, except on
very rare occasions, when be gave a few pen
sions to valeU and his lower servants ; but he
always rave alms to the vicar and -the capu
chins of Meudon.
This love for building seems to have
been an Inherited quality in "Monsdg
neur," for we find in his royal father the
came taste. In this connection Saint-
Simon has an interesting anecdote to tell
that brings out more than one point re
garding the character of Louis and of the
great Louvols as well:
The war of 1688 had an equally strange
origin, the narrative of which, alike authentic
and curious, serves so > well to characterize
both the King and Louvola that It ought to find
a place here. Louvols. on the death of Colbert,
took bis place as superintendent of buildings.
The little porcelain Trianon, built for Mme. de
Montespan, dissatisfied the King, who ' always
wanted palace*. He amused hlmaelf Immense
ly in building; be bad a compass In his eye
for proportions, accuracy and symmetry, but
taste waa lacking, aa we shall see tlse wher*.
The new chateau was going up when the Kins
observed a defect In a window which waa Just
being finished along a line of others on the
range of the ground floor. Louvols. who was
rude by nature and no spoilt that he would
scarcely allow bis master to find fault' with
him, disputed the matter stoutly and maintain
ed that the window was right. The King turn
ed his back upon him and walked off elsewhere.
Next day he taw Le Notre, . a ' good archi
tect, though more" famous for his taste In
gardens, which , he was the first to Introduce
Into France, bringing them to a state Â¦ of tha
highest perfection. The King asked : him If
ha bad been to Trianon. He said no. The
King then explained what had struck his eye
and told him to so and look at that window.
Next day the same question, same answer;
and the day after, . the same. The King, saw
that . Le Notre would not risk finding either
himself or Louvols to blame. He waa angry,
and ordered him to be at Trianon the next
"day. when he should be there himself and
Louvols also. This time there was no means
of getting out. of it. The King found them
both at Trianon when he arrived there.'. The
question , of the window came up at once.
Louvois disputed the point; Le Notre said

The Color of Eis Soul.
' "The Color cf His Soul," by Zoe Ander
son Norrls, is a scries of Bohemian
sketches held together by the thread of a
story. A large amount of small talk goes
to make .up the contents of the book that
Is fairly interesting,, but rather long
drawn out. The story is told by one of
the charactersâ a woman. The hei~o is a
man endowed with wonderful powers as
a lecturer and i3 particularly fascinating
to some women. He has a most remark
able pair of eyes that resemble, those of
u cat, and this peculiarity is being con
stantly Drought out during the course of
the narrative; also the tendency of the
youth to be a total disbeliever- In all
things regarding God or a future life.
Tho tale ends with a tragedy, the direct
renult of the selfishness of this soulless
young man. Funk & "Wagnalls. New
York,. tho publishers, have given the book
a very attractive appearance both inside
and -out. (Price $1.)
Y T is a pleasure to be? able to call
especial attention to so excellent a
scries of publications as that under-
JL taken by Hardy. Pratt & Co. of Bos-
ion. to which they give the namt of
"Versailles Historical Series." This
series, in "Le Ccur de France Edition,"
5s limited to 12iO copic-s. To date eight
volumes have appeared. The first three
contained the memoirs of .Madanie t'.e
Mottville and were reviewed at some
length in these columns upon their ap
pearance. They tell of that interesting
pcricd In French history when Louis XIII
and ,Anne of Austria sat upon the throne.
Now follow four volumes containing the
memoirs of the Due de Saint-Simon: and
also, very appropriately, another volume,
the eighth in the scries, in which is given
the correspondence at Madame Princess
Palatine, mother of the Regent; of Marie
Adelaide de Savoie. Duchesse of Bour
cogoe, and of Madame Â«le Maintenon, in
relation to Salnt-Cyr.
These five volumes are uniform in typo
graphy, illustration and binding with
those three books that contain the me
moirs of Madame de Mottville. Thia
series Is profusely illustrated by splendid
reproductions in color cf ancient por
traits; and for this, as well as for their
binding and printing, deserves the position
that the excellence of the matter con
tained should receive.
The memoirs of Saint-Simon as origin
ally written amounted to some twenty
volumes of good site. In this present
edition, translated by Katharine Pres
cott Wormeley, these twenty books have
been abridged to four. The work has
been more than well done, and as it now
6tands serves to give us a more lifelike
picture of the days of Louis XIV than
can be gathered from any other pen of
that time. In explaining the abridgment
the translator says: "The translation
Elves as follows: The outline of Saint-
Simon's career, a selection of such por
traits as may be read with interest by the
general reader, several of the great his
torical scenes, and something of the mere
court gossip and Intrigue. J The parts re
lating to the campaigns have been omit
ted."
These memoirs as they now stand can
rot fail to prove most interesting to all
students of history, dealing as they do
with that period of French history when
France was the most important and en
terprising nation of the world. Saint-
Simon is a great painter and brings the
people of his day before you so -clearly
that you seem to live with them and go
through all the happenings of those most
brilliant days of monarchlal France.
Every little point was caught and record
ed by this all-observant man, whose close
position to the throne rendered him such
goldf-n opportunities for observation and
news gathering. His little points of his
torical gossip are as entertaining as nc
-tion. and mere dry historical facts as
generally presented to the student pale
beside them. In speaking of the Czar,
Peter the Great, and his travels in 163S,
he says:
The Czar has already begun his travels. He
has. Justly, made 60 much noise in the world
that I thall be succinct about a prince so
treat and so well known and one who no doubt
will be bo to the latest posterity, for having
made himself alarming to all Europe and
roinsled necessarily in the affairs of this part
of the world, with a court which had never
hitherto been a court, -and a nation despised
and utterly disregarded for Its barbarism. This
prince had gone to Holland to learn for hlm
eelf and work with his own hands at the build
ing of chips. Although incognito, pursuing his
purpose, and not allowing his raak or his
grandeur to hamper him, be made everything
yield to him, but after his own fashion and
as be chose.
Ee was Inwardly displeased that England
did not hasten to 6end him an embassy when
be waa thus In ber close neighborhood, and all
the more because, without committing himself.
he waa very desirous of allying himself with
bar tor commerce. The embassy at last ar
rive*. At first he postponed giving It audi
ence; finally be named a day and hour, but
the place was on board a large Dutch vessel
which he wished to examine. TJiere were two
Ambassadors and they thought^fhe place bar
barons, but they had to accept It. Matters
were still worse when they got on board. The
Ocar sent them word he was In the maintop,
and It waa there be would receive them. The
ESxbassadors, whoee sea. less were not suf
ficiently steady to risk the shrouds, excused
Jheaaelvea; the Czar insisted and the Ein
busadora were much disturbed by so strange
and obstinate a proposal. At last, after a
tew routrh anrwers to their next message, they
felt tiey must needs attempt the horrid ladder
up tbey went. In that narrow space and
â¢winging In mlfiair the Czar received them
with as much majesty as If he were sitting
on hU throne. He listened to their harangue
and answered obligingly to the King and the
BAttoa; then he Joked at the fear he saw de
pleted on the Bmbasaadors* faces and laugh

baring come to him too late.

Professor C. Oaborne Ward, one of the
most eminent scholars in America, died
at Yuma, Ariz., on Thursday after a
lingering Illness. Professor Ward, who
had been translator for the Federal
Bureau of Labor for twenty years, spent
thirty-eight years in writing a history of
the common people from the earliest his
toric to Constantlre. In 1SSS he Wfts
associated with the eminent Charles
Darwin and at that early period he had
gone well along In his life work.
Being a great linguist and historian,
Mr. Ward searched the world's libraries
in quest of information for his great his
tory. He traveled fiftv thousand miles,
haunted Babylonia and Greece, mastered
ethnology and archaeology and ran down
every known clew to unlock the secrets
of the past.
Colonel Carroll D. Wright, United
States Commissioner of Labor, considered
Mr. Ward the greatest authority In the
world on the subject of ancient socialism
and the Industrial teachings of Christ.
The last work that Mr. Ward did was
the dictation of a great deal of matter
and the careful writing of many notes,
even in his feeble condition, for the use
of his literary executor, Leigh H. Irvine,
who recently returned from the bedside
of the aged sufferer.

Russia is scarcely a good country to be
famous in. Besides Tolstoi there is an
other eminent writer who has fallen un
der the Government's displeasure, and
has reason to know it. Thla is Maximo
Gorky, like the Count, a novelist and also
a dramatist, with an objectionable ten
dency to x search the barbarous survivals
of Russian life "for secrets better bid."
His movements are subjected to so much
scrutiny that he has had to obtain Gov
ernment authorization to winter In Cri
mea. It is granted on condition that he
goes nowhere near Yalta. At Moscow,
through which city his route lay to the
south, some hundreds of people, not hav
ing the official proprieties before laelr
eyes, had organized a little platform re
ception and demonstration of sympathy.
But they know how to manage these
things in the Russian prefectures. The
demonstrators were allowed to organize
their little party and to assemble on the
platform in gleeful anticipation. But the
express was pulled up just outside the
city,*" Gorky was ordered out, transferred
to the guard's van of a goods' train, un
der strict orders not to show himself, and
In this way was whisked through Moscow
under the very eyes of his friends, with
out their ever suspecting^his presence.
The last book of his' stories is an

One." This volume will contain a preface
by Ivan Strannik, giving a brief account
of Gorky, and will be followed by three

so much of "Madame," as she, is called,
the sister-in-law of Louis XIW and of
Marie Adelaide de Savoie, .Duchesse de
Bourgcgrne, and" also of Madame de Main
tenon, that it seems cuitc necessary that
we should read thoir correspondence and
form our own opinions of them through
their letters. The correspondence . of
Madame de Malntenon s in relation to
Eaint-Cyr, th* Bchool for needy but v/ell

is not so interesting as that of the frank
"Madame." From Saint-Simon we get
enough, however, to. realize that Madame
de Malntenon was the most important

3d and 4th of June. The Kins was at Ver

o Â¦ â ofireside-, happiness was when your feet
were on the fender. During his late
years one of his friends coming in found
him In a dejected state of mind and asked
"What -is the matter, my friend?" Mr.
Holmes looked up with a look of sorrow
and Bald: "Don't you see? There are only
two feet on the fender now." â¢The sa
credness and happiness of the marriage
relation is here so touchingly expressed.
What pathos of the aftertime when hus

gone away to return no more to hia, or
her, earthly home. The thought may well
startle us. How much may be unheed
lngly done by ourselves to destroy our
home Joy. How easy for one to con
jure up his dislikes and keep addintr

until his home becomes unbearable.

to accompany him, to the garden a day or

over the roof of their cottage. Giving his

other side and exclaimed 'Pull the line!'
She pulled at his request as far as she
could. H\ cried_ 'Pull it overt* "I can't,'
ehe. replied. 'But pull with all your

"But In vain were all the efforts of the
bride to pull over the line so long as her
husband held the opposite end. But when
he came : around and they pulled at the
same end, it came over with great ease.
"â¢There,' said he, as the line fell from

It isn't so bad for those unfortunates

"We hear and read a s-ood deal about

band and father. *
But few men appreciate the re
sponsibilitv thev assume when they
take a young wife away from the shelter
of mother love and father love ("the
vrarroest, softest human nest in this
world" (says Dr. Cuyler) and take her to
a new home, where their love is to be
theJr only shelter.
Whatever else a man mav be. if he

The duty of the husband is to show
affection toward his wife and chil
dren. I
Where this affection exists it will
be cenuineiv manifested.
"Husbands, levs your wives." Why
thould any man ever think of marrying
if he cannot genuinely love his wife?
Plenty men do, I know. They marry for
convenience (as a rule such, marriages
prove very inconvenient things), or for
respectability's sake, to please their
friends, or to spite their relatives. Some
men marry simrjly because they can, oth
ers marry to break their loneliness. Such
are not disappointed, because they find
everything but loneliness
The sum of the husband's dutv is
love, and this will reerulate all other
duties.
The obligation of affection is not
all on the side of the -wife. Byron is
right, I believe, when he* says: "Man's
fl love Is of. man's life a thing apart, 'Tis
woman's whole existence."
It may be that man cannot show
such affection as woman, but every
husband is bound* to highly esteem his
wife.
The husband expects as a matter
of course that his wife be a perpetual
sunbeam In the home. That Is right, but
the wife has the same right ' to expect
of her husband better things than a
thunder cloud of 111 nature and boorish- -
ness or a hailstorm of fault-finding.
If the familv circle is to become a
tranauil and cherished haven of rest,
the husband must not simplv assume
that his affection is recognized, as a mat
ter of course, but he must manifest his
love in some visible form in the home.
Everv husband likes a cheerful at-V
mosphere in his borne life, but many do
almost nothing toward creating such an
atmosphereâ they leave that solely to
their wives, some of whom have a big
contract on their hands. Imagine such
a wife trying: to maintain a calm and
charminerlv sweet demeanor while her
husband is sullen and fault finding.
"The husband and wife are each the
complement of the other." says the
Leader, "and it is as mucn his duty to be
cheerful as it is hers to be patient; his
right to bring joy into the door as lt is
her right to sweep and garnish the pleas
ant interior."
A sunshiny husband makes a beau
tiful home, a cheerful wife and glad
children. His dally walk makes the home
life a festival and crowns the home with
heavenly benediction.
Much depends upon jrettine a cheer
ful start in the mornine. The man
who leaves his home with a scowl on his
brow, a snap at b5s children and a bark
at his wife. Instead , of a kiss, will be
mighty poor company for any one during
the day, and lt Is more than likely that
be will return home with a temper of a
porcupine.
There is nothing a â¢Â»n needs more
than a happv home. His nature and''
safety demand it. Yet the ciatm^ 0I
home and household are not felt by busi
ness men as they should be.
Dr. Cuyler says: "Many of them \

V^ eminent, wt may ask what part
the husband and father is to bear in
making a real home.
The first secret of a happy home life
lift- with the parents; if they are all they
ought to be the safety of the, home and
the country is guaranteed. i3ut ir parents
are not congenial spirits or If they allow
their coarse nature to piay the tyrant
tnd rudeness and selfishness to pervade
the atmosphere of the home. Siien will
home lose its attractiveness and become
a curse instead of a blessing %to the
country.
There is no graver responsibility resting
upon any one than that Â«vnlch rests upon
parents. It is no favorable omen when
parents feel but lightly the responsibility.
It is indeed appalling, the sad condition of
things existing to-day. True love and
natural regard seem to be seriously lack
ing with many husbands and wives. The
manner in which they treat each other
would lead us to think there never was
any union of hearts with them. They soon
forget the marriage vows they mutually"
took upon themselves, spend their
lives in bitterness and sorrow until the
deplorable divorce mill relieves them. The
present status of divorce law in this
country is a curse to the marriage rela
tion and is destructive of all that is most
sarred to the home.
Think of s calling- that place home
Â¦where for two years the piano has been
kept shut because of trouble between the
parents, who are net on speaking terms.
Such a home is worse than prison. It
would require much of the grace of God
to abide within its walls.
Such parents â¬re criminally gxiilty be
fore God cf treachery against high
heaven.
It :s the husbeud's and father's part
in solving this problem we shall consider
in this talk.
The words of the great apost'e of God
in his epistle to the Colossians, "Hus
bands, love your wives, and be not bitter
egrainrt tbem." could with equal force and
appropriateness be addressed to the bene
dicts of this age.
Then there is a little exhortation in the
apostle's letter to the Ephesians that
v-ould not come amiss in our day: "And,
ye fathers, provoke not your children to
wrath; but bring them up in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord."
The husband has his part in mak
ire a happv hone. Much of the dam
age to the home life comes through the
husband and father, if he is not in every
sense a man.

evil is greater prudence at the marriage

When a true man does abide in his
home he isn't mean and little enough to
be always taking advantageof the Scrip
ture reference to the wife's obedience and
subjection to her husband. Why is it that
some men are so little that they must
keep harping on man's superiority over
the woman. Such a man is ignorant of
the true import of God's words. He is
a coward and unworthy the name , of a
man. Such a man looks upon his wife as
his inferior, and such a spirit is repulsive
to a noble woman. I can't understand
God's word that way. but In this way:
Â«Â«a virtuous woman Is a crown to her
husband," and "the heart of her husband
doth safely trust In her," "Her husband

To make a .real happy home the
husband and father must not only
be true, brave, generous, manlv^ hÂ«
must be a man of pure, blameless
life, whose name is an honor and
pride in the home.
No man who has not given himself to

living than he himself practices?
This applies to a man' 3 entire Ufa. NÂ©
man who comes home drunk, how
ever rarely, is doing his share In making
happiness for his wife and family. HÂ«
must be a sober man.
Mrs. Marie Hilton, founder of tÂ«e
Creche in England, after twenty-two
years* experience in work for the chil
dren of the poor, says that drink is the
prime factor in destroying even the sem
blance of comfort in their homes.
Children will not honor the -father who

We need more Christian husbands.

Now, it is not necessary to wear one's
heart on their sleeve, neither is it neces

from our very own the tenderness which
we feel for them with every heart-throb.
To do so is wrong, and robs both our dear
ones and ourselves of a happiness -which
should be realized now.
The woman opened her half-closed eyes
and a slight flush crept over her withered

I'll live," and with a happy sigh she fell

Love may be marred by a disagreeable
temper. It is possible for a man to be un
generous and cruel in his home, because
those among whom be associates in the
world stir up his anger. A man Is a cow
aru who dots It. But the character
Charles Dickens portrays under the name
of Mr. Quilp in vibe Old Curiosity
Shop" is not altogether a fictitious one."
for there are many Mr. Quilps now living.
What a savage and liendistt brute for a
husband was that Mr. Quilp, with his
cold, repulsive silence one minute and his
stinging words of Bharp and angry re
proof the next. It makes one creep to
think of his irritating actions and willful
and tantalizing conduct.
He studied now to inflict the. keenest
torture on the loving ana submissive Mrs.
Quilp. Sucii a character is repulsive. And
yet how many husbands show the same
tender and considerate regard for their
wife as life advances and cares multiply
as when they stood by her side at the
altar, a lovely, confiding bride? Men be
come careless and thoughtless on these
things.
Before marriage men are very careful
and stuuious in cultivating a young
woman's affections, but with many a.i
that ceases with their wedding feast.
Every true wife needs, craves for
and genuinely appreciates the affec
tion of her husband, and "a hus

A physician recently related to us an
incident which came under his own ob
servation. He was counting the flagging
pulse of a very sick woman, who seemed
to have no desire to prolong her-life of
semi-starvation in heart and body, when
her husband, a morose, hard-visaged
man, drew near, the bed and with a dry
sob in his voice said, "Save her, doctor. I
eouldn't live without her."
Not only will a true husband's affection
be genuinely manifested by a devoted
and manly love, but it will be free from
harshness. "And be not bitter against
them."
Another adopted the rule of allowing
fifteen minutes to pass before replying to
an irritating sentence.
Persistent, devoted, unselfish, for
bearinff. all-conquerinsr love will
drive out ail the little viuers of con
iueral quarrels that creep into the
home nest and destroy domestic hap
piness.
It is said that Philip Henry and bis
wife adopted a ruie that only one of them
would get angry at the same time.
Charles Klngsley tells a true story oi
two hermit monks who had lived together
in closest frVendship for years, with no
thought k of envy or selfish rivalry in the
mind of either. At last it occurred u>
them to. try the experiment of a quarrel
after the common fashion of the world.
"How can we quarrel?" asked one. "Oh,"
said the other, "we can take this brick
and put it between us and each can claim
it. Then we'll quarrel over it." And that
plan was agreed on. "This brick is
mine," said the one; "I hope it is mine,"
said the other gently. "Well, if It la
yours, take it," said the other, who could
never hear his companion express a wish
for anything without having 3 desire to
get it for him. So the quarrel 'failed
through the unselfishness of both.
Now if a man finds that when he took
to himself a wife he took a cross, let him
bear his cross like a man. If this were
more binding on him by the laws of the
land, man would be more discreet about
binding such mamage chains which press

The Italian Violin.
T? TALIAN violins have not always held
the supremacy they now enjoy. It was
U not indeed until the beginning SrVhe
nineteenth century that they came ltfto
vogue to any extent outside their natlva
land. Previously Jacob Steiner (1621-83)
was the favorite maker, and his high
model had been almost exclusively copied
by his fellow-Germans and different mak
ers in France and England. When the
cldeT Corvetto, who" had been a merchant
before entering the musical profession,
came to London In 1738 he brought with
him some Instruments by Stradivari. The
result of this endeavor to Introduce Ital
ian work into England fills one with pa
thetic wonder; it Is almost beyond belief.
As he could not get as much as Â£5 ($23)
for a violoncello, he was obliged to send Ihe
instrument back to Italy, as a bad spec
ulation. Five 'pounds for a "Strad." and
not a single purchaser to be found! This
Incident in itself furnishes sufficient tes
timony to the slavi3h following of tha
great German maker and the strong
prejudice of the violinists' of that pe
riod, in favor of the high modelo. It Is.
Indeed, the players who are most to blame
for the alow adoption of the flat model.

THE SUNDAY CAM,.
10Tun ctojÂ» of Easter brides Is as plen
tiful as ever this spring. They al
ways spring up like the crocuses
end the violetsâ In such sudden
profusion that you -wonder where
on earth they all can have come from.
Some of these weddings are to take
place on Easter day Itself. Mary Virginia
Shields Is to be ene of the Easter day
brides. She is that charming daughter of
the late Corporal Shieldsâ she Is the
daughter of an army man and is to be
the wife of another. Frank Hutter of An
gel Island is the groom and the wedding
Will be a truly military on*.
Bel\e Newman Is another Easter day
bride. J. Lewis Abrams will com* down
from hie home in Stockton and bear her
away from ber grandparents' home,
where thÂ© wedding will take place. Mr.
and Mrs. Redllck are the grandparents.
Btlll another wedding to take place on
the thirtieth iÂ» that of Flora Cohen and
Albert Baer. It will be a home affair, and
thm floral decorations planned will look
Ilk* a spring flower-bed growing indoors.
Easter Monday, the Slot, will see a
beautiful church wedding in the Church
of tb* New Jerusalem in Brooklyn. This
Interests Baa Francisco, inasmuch as the
rroexa is Dr. ;WiUlam Redwood Price
Clark of this city, who will bring the
bride back here to make her new home
among us. The invitations read: "Mrs.
James Frederick Goddard requests your
presence at the marriage of her daughter,
Edith Langdon." -
Th* second flay of April will see Vome
weddings in the southern part of town.
At the Mission Dolores Church, close to
the old Mission, which no doubt witnessed
many similar ceremonies In early Califor
nia days, Sallle Lennon and Frederick
Ruddock will be married. On the same
day St John's Episcopal Church will wit
ness the marriage of Flora King -and Per
cy Clay Black. Besides these, Matie Hart
and Charles Buss will be married, as well
as Marie Robbins and Christian Hilbert,
The Easter Wednesday wedding Is estab
lished by long custom.
The following day, April 3, will see two
gallant officers wedded. Major John Hull,
judge advocate of the local army head
quarters, will marry Greta Chase of Des
Moines. Captain Ormond Lissak of the
ordnance department will marry Alice
Warrington in Philadelphia.
On the 9th of April comes the famous
Preston-Drown wedding that has N ' been
keeping San Francisco interested for a
long time. Miss Edith Preston and Wil
lard Drown will have a swell church wed
ding that promises to be as elaborate an
affair as anybody can anticipate.
Other brides' of the early part of April
will be Lulu Kuhls, who marries H. L.
Detjen, and Lottie Sharpe, who marries
Sidney Cavill, the popular swimmer of the
Olympic Club.*
Later In the month come some more
weddings. Isabel Van Winkle's is one of
these. â¢ She will be married at' her
parents' home on Howard" street and Wil
liam H. Thompson will be the person who
plays second fiddle on the occasion, as
the groom always must do for at least one
day in his career.
The Passavant-Szontagh wedding will
also be In late April. Mrs. Annie* Passa
vant and Oscar Szontagh, the famous
mining expert, will be married then. They
are going north to live in Washington.
The last day of April will see the clos
ing of these weddings when Miss Clara
Huntington becomes the bride of the
young Southerner, Gilbert Brooks Per
kins. The home on Jackson street will
be gorgeous with spring decorations and
the affair will be a grand finale.
(T\HEEE are trousseaus and troUs-
I seaus. - ! >*^ . .
I Miss Georgia Hopkins, now Mrs.
I Fred McNear, paid five hundred
JL dollars for. the lingerie alone of her
trousseau. That needn't discourage you,
however.: You can get up a whole trous
seau, from hat to boots, for seventy dol
lars, and perhaps you will be just as hap
pily married as the several thousand dol
lar girls. Your chances are even, any
way.
From the lingerie outward, quality al
ways pays better than quantity. In the
inexpensive trousseau you will notice
that the underwear Is placed at a very
small cost, but if you can do any hand
embroidery, you can fit yourself out like
the smartest bride of the Easter season.
The trousseau of lingerie pictured on this
page is a seventy-live dollar set from the
White House. It Is extremely simple In
design, having very few frills and fun'
belows; and fine handwork is what costs.
If you have a skillful needle you can im
itate this for yourself to a large extent. "
jj The set consists of four pieces, which,
priced separately,- run in thiswise:
Nightgown .. $30
Drawers 20
Chemise . ;...... 15
Corset cover ....::..... ic .
This is a fair sample of the sets that
our swellest brides have bought. You will
notice little trimming. The lace is not
very wide nor is it put on in great quan
tities. It 'Is of the finest Valenciennes,
which edges the dainty battlements that
trim the muslin. "-,._ â¢ -^ .
The French petticoat shown in the pic
ture' is | a fluffy dream. The sheerest
muslin forms the basis of this. |The up
per part is tight, as fashion demands;,
over' the hips it 'fits like a glove. ;A11 the
fullness is hr-the deep flounce which flares
just above the ankles, and is edged with
a deep lace at the bottom. Hand-sewing
againâ and more hand-embroidery. This
design is the very newest thing that ever
was conceived. It is In accord with the
present fad for pearls. Festooned ropes
of them, that is their embroidered like
nesses, are looped with embroidered bow
knotsâall, of course, in pure white. -The
ckirt can be had for $25.
The rose corset Is another characteris
tically Parisian part of the swell wedding
outfit. It has a long front and two sets
of j^arters are attached â one pair, in front,
one at the sides, helping to hold the- cop- '
set.down In place. These points are the
essentials that should go with "Â¦ every up
to-date corset. But the beauty "of this
one! It Is of, the most delicate brocaded
silk, white', in ground, with sprinkled pink
rosebuds lying "on it^ in , brocaded 'relief.
The tiniest of ribbon rufflesâ white - and
pink and greenâ decorate 'â¢. the . top of the :
corset. They, carry! out the . tints of the â¢
roses and their foliage. ,' v , v ." c; *â¢'â¢'â¢;
A bewitching gown which can be had
for the neat little sum of $250- is shown
. . . . â¢ â¢ - Â¦;
in the -large picture, it Is worthy being
made the piece de resistance of the trous
seau. The lace, which covers it entire-'
ly with the ; exception . of the gimp, is
what makes the gown cost. It Is a heavy
applique lace, a deep shade of, cream.
: The skirt, of dead â¢white taffeta, Is en
tirely covered from waist to^hem by the
lace. It f3 â¢ finished at the bottom over
the taffeta flounce in deep points. >
You can pay any amount that you
Â¦ please for a - wedding trousseau. You can
run your bill "up into the hundreds and
thousands. You . can likewise get a sub
stantial outfit- for $70 ;it you know how
to economize. ; : . - Â¦ ...
. . Take a : look at the matter. Perhaps
you have!an idea" that the thing can't be
done. It is not easy, and the trousseau Â¦,
must be simple, but there is -no reason
why,; you can't be, comfortably and pret-v
tlly dressed for that amount of money..
In the first . place, let .your wedding
gown > be the tailor suit. This is neces- .
sary. \You cannot have a wedding gown
. with veil for any such small outlay. But
remember that some of the , Bwellest,
brides have tailor-made weddings, any-<
way. This tailor suit will be appropriate
for the trip if. you have one, and it will
be the all-around, useful costume of your
â¢ wardrobe. Â¦ It will do for matinees, 1 call
ing, afternoon teas. It will do for church;
it .will do for shopping; it can ba varied â¢
by the bodices worn with it. 'The skirt

Little Lord Fauntleroy Grown to lA/orriarthooci
TV Â» ISS ELSIE LESLIE, who will
I \ /I ** "Little Lord Faun-
I V I tleroy" to most of our theater-
V ~ I goers, has grown up to a vexy
JL remarkable womanhood. She
Is quite the ideal of the successful actress.
She has beauty, wealth, talent, youth and
social prestige. Moreover, she is one of
the most popular women'on the stage.-
Her career has been one of exceptional
refinement and comfort. Some^ten or
twelve years " ago the sensation she
created as the little child actress in
Frances Hodgson Burnett's masterpiece
ttbjs truly phenomenal. Her talent and
chaxming personality made - her known
from one end of the world to the .other,
while her costumes In the play ; set the
fashions for children for a whole decade.
But.whe.xi at last the piece was with
drawn fronvthe stage everybody asked
what now for litle Elsie. Daniel Froh
man answered the question by withdraw
ing ber from the stage and personally
superintending her, education. It was he
who first brought her out as i the child In
"Edith's Burglar."
Then she was sent abroad' to travel
over the Continent. For a year or more
she lived In France, after which she re
turned to New York and entered Miss
Ely's school, where her education was
completed. Through these latter years it
was decided for her that she should re
main in private life. 'â-â¢
But the lure of the "stage was still
strong upon her and two or three seasons
ago she returned to the stage as the, lead
ing lady for Joseph Jefferson " In '.'The
Rivals" and "The Cricket on. the Hearth."
This seconQ appearance aSter the lapse of
several years, - and which, strange -as; it
may seem Hn- the light .of* her big hit. in
"Little Lord' Fauntleroy," she r considers
her real debut, was ; watched with * eager
interest by those who had prophesied that
she would be; as disappointing; as most
child actresses are .when;they,;grow up/, .-' Â¦
She quickly proved that her. acting .of a '
decade ago was something more than â¢ mere
childish ; precocity by showing unusual
talent and 'dramatic Â¦ power . In her ma
turity. -."â¢ What ; was even more surprising
was her, heightened beauty and her original
taste in gowns. As she had set the fash
ions for boys- in /"Little r Lord Fauntle-'
roy'.' - she ; is now showing : some stunning
creations Â» for â¢ women as Glory â¢ Quayle in
"The Christian." , - -,
â¢ Moreover, she can ; afford to "dress the
part, 1 ' to use stage vernacular, with r a;
lavish- hand, for u she v is' richâ lndepend- â¢
ently. : richâ in her own right and only re-"

acting. Â¦â¢'. . Â¦Â¦..-*Â¦_Â¦:Â¦.. .; â¢Â¦â¢ / '.... . : Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢:.

i
Have a light pair of gloves costing $1 60
and a pair for common wear at $L
Half a dozen pairs of stockings can be
had for $1 50. One dozen handkerchiefs
will cost tho same. Shoes In any style
you desiro can be bought for $3 50. Light
weight boots are the best for all-round
wear. This allows you SI 83 for little
things, such as neck ribbons and belts,
and you have spent only |70.
Have a flannel waist This can bÂ«
bought for II 25. Especially In tha Ban
L'rancisco climate this will be useful dor
ing a good- deal, of the summer. Havj a
c^lor that will not soil easily, for thÂ«
cleaning of these garments is expenstY*
ii done out and dinicult if done at home.
if scarlet is becoming to you, a scarlet
tlanner wai3t will be both durable and
pretty. - When your husband comes boma
tired to death the very sight of roar
bright red waist ought to jolly him op.
Two wash waists should^oe bought^at
a dollar apiece. Have these of light Â«un>
mery colors and wash out the cuffs your
self occasionally, forXthese often soil
while the waist is otherwise fresh. White
is becoming, soils no faster than blu* or
pink and does not fade. Have, at any
rate, one of these waists white.
For $12 you can get your beat Â§*ownâ
something that will do for the UttU par
ties that you hope to attend with yotsr
husband. Let the gown be of challU,
which comes at 50 cents a yard. Use tucks
for the trimming, and if you are lucky
. enough to have good ribbons or lace on
hand you can use them to excellent ad
vantage in making the costume more
dressy.
Buy a ready-made wrapper for Â£3. Have
it of flannelette and it will be fairly
warm. Your one new hat must be a
trimmed one which will do to be married
in, and you must exercise plenty of Judg
ment in choosing its color, as it has to
harmonize with all of your gowns. Black
and white is modish and convenient. A 53
hat can be pretty and stylish if your mil
liner knows her business.
Your underwear should be bought
ready-made. Don't have it trimmed ex
cept with ruffles of the muslin. Good
muslin is better than poor lace. Have four
sets; two of them can be bought for $3 60
each, the other two for $4 10 each. This
bring3 the whole amount to $13 40. which
is decidedly less than $500, and yet It is
quite as possible to be daintily neat at
that small cost. s.r-* --,Â¦
Two petticoats will do very well. Have
a white one for best and a dark-colored
sateen one for every-day use. These can
be bought for a dollar apiece. The corset
will cost U 50.

THE EASTER BRIDEWe know little of Lazarus, but
we. are: all acquainted with Mar
tha, the. active, energetic spirit,
the one who loved to manage and
to, make; and with Mary, the
sweet/gentle sister, who was Hap
piest when sitting at her Lord's
feet, drinking in the gracious
words that proceeded from -his
mouth. You remember how, on
one occasion when Jesus came to
the home, Martha began to bus
tle- about and get ready some
thing worthy of their guest and
..became | quite â¢ angry. . with > .her
quiet sistenbecause she' was not
moved by his presence in , \ the
same way^-so when she, could
stand it no longer her annoyance
got the better of her ; courtesy,
and she demanded of Christ,
dragging him; as it were, into the
unrest of her. own bustling na
ture, "Lord, dost thou not care
that my sister hath left me to
Â£erve alone? Bid her that she help
me." One can almost see, the
Lord's gentle smile of amused
compassion as he replies: "Mar
tha,- Martha, thou art careful and
troubled about many things; but
one thing is needful, and Mary
hath chosen that good part which
shall never be taken away from
her!"
Do we not live now in a bus
tling age and has not our wor
ship been too much affected by
the spirit of the age? Is not too
much of our worship a bustling
about Christ rather than a quiet
sitting down to listen to Christ?
Our women are "cumbered about .!
much serving and they grow
tired and irritable, and angrily ;
demand that all others should 'do,,
as they do. Is not the. word of
Christ in seasonâ there is but
one thing needful,. 'communion, ,
fellowship with God" in Christ.
We spend so. much of our time
to-day in the spreading^of the ta
ble that little is left for the enter
taining of the guest.
Those .who need elaborate rit

designs I have often been asked
to describe my conception, oi

always seen before me a figure

more distinct until now it is as
though I saw Joan, to use her
own words, 'with the eyes of rav

nor has there come down to us
the smallest shred of her vest

dark. Her hair 'was, in all prob

difference- of opinion. To me

fair, as thus she seems more fem

We have no definite record of
the personal appearance of Joan
of Arc. Necessarily she must
have had form and feature in
some way worthy of the beautiful
soul that dwelt within. No bet
ter idea can be gained of what
she must have been than the de
scription of the artist, Boutet de
Monvel, who spent years of study
upon the incidents of her life for
the purpose of depicting her ca
reer by means of his brush. He
says in the Century Magazine for
November, 1896:
If any question the right oi
this national heroine of France to
a place among" the most beauti
ful v.oir.en in history, I would
say that the claim is to spiritual
rather than physical beauty
Thus the term is 'used in a far
higher and nobler sense " than
when applied to such as Cleo
patra. What beauty could be
more worthy of reverence 1 and
worship than the loveliness of the
simple, sincere, courageous soul
that inspired armies to success
and rescued France from de
spair?
The life of Joan of Arc has a
lesson for our age â in fact for
every nation and for all time. It
is not set forth in simple'terms,
and the world has been slow to
understand its meaning. It is
given iii a parable â rather' it is
contained in miracles. The
achievements of Joan of Arc
were so wonderful.- so mnacu
lous, that men have been back
ward b receiving their true im
port. Their lesson, however, is
simple when once we compre
hend the miracle. :
\'W */ **A*v meaning can the
\)A// Â» Ie of this child-saint
*-* and woman-warrior of
fifteenth century France have for
women of twentieth century
America? Little need has
the present world for saints
of the old-time description. Still
less is there need of women-war
riors, in our time, pledged
to peace, and in our land, filled
with brave men. It must not be \
expected that the lesson be one
of example for imitation. History
teaches by touching the soul, by
quickening the moral insight, by
an in-breathing of noble spirit.
Imitation, mere copying the past,
is futile; for conditions are ever
changing; and never repeated.
Who could rescue France from
this depth of degradation ? Who
could unite the warring faction?
against the invader? What was .
denied to princes and captains
was granted to the peasant girl
of Domremy. To save France
was the mission of Joan of Arc.
History contains nothing more
wonderful than this, and yet it
is nothing supernatural. It is as
natural as the rainfall replenish
ing the thirsty earth. France was
in , ruins through partisanship.
Only the spirit of patriotism
could rebuild and restore. Joan
of Arc was the embodiment of
that spirit. In her patriotism
was made riesh and dwelt among
Such was the condition of
France during the childhood of
Joan of Arc, born January 5,
141 2. The battle of Agincourt,
fought three years later, gave
half of France ' into the hands
of Henry V of England. In 1420
came "le traite infame" of Troves
by which the conqueror gained
the daughter of the King of
.France for his bride, the regency
and the promise of the throne
upon the King's death â and, all
this with French help against
France.
At the end- of the tenth century
France was a feudally divided land
with ten thousand separate fiefs,
and a score of great lords, any
one of them .equal to the King in
power. By the end of the thir
teenth century a long road had
been traveled toward national
unity. Private warfare had been
forbidden; uniformity of law had
been established; the authority
of the King's courts was recog
nized. Still the goal had not yet
been reached ; and a succession
of weak sovereigns and the evils
of the endless wars with the Eng
lish sent the nation far on the
backward course. Province
broke away from province. The
great Dukes sought to recover
their lost power, and upon the
ruins of France to rear the tem
ples of their own s^fish pride.
There were no Frenchmen â only
Burgundians, Armagnacs, Bret
ons, Provencaux. To such a de
gree of bitterness and hatred did
men carry their partisan strife 1
that either side was ready to wel
come the foreign invader rather
than see the success of the rival
faction.
To many the career of Joan of
Arc has seemed an inexplicable
mystery; to some,- a product ol
mere superstition. To view it
aright one must study it in rela
tion to the condition of the lime,
as one would study the work oi
Julius Caesar or of Abraham
Lincoln. What was the France
for which Joan of Arc lived, an
angel of healing, and died, a
inspired the thought of gallantry.
If not pretty, however, she had
probably the beauty of the peas
ant; a firmly, well constructed
head; her eyes were bluish gray,
not too light, for they flashed fire
at times; her nose was somewhat
heavy, but with sensitive nostrils;
and her mouth strongly marked,
with full, red lips. Her complex
ion was browned by exposure,
rich and healthy in color; her car
riage free and somewhat boyish,
for she was a girl of the fields,
free as air, and her limbs were
vigorous, and her chest was
deep. She never knew fatigue,
say the chronicles of her time."

under the guidance of. archangels. This
is but the form ef the fifteenth century
thoughtâ the only way in which her rev
elation could be known to men. Certainly
at this date we can distinguish the divine
truth that spoke through her, from the
peculiar form in which It had to find ex
pression. It Is unnecessary . to speak of
her martyrdom. Her work was finished;
she scaled It with her life, a sacrifice to
hate and cowardice, ever present tn the
world.
Patriotism and humanity are the lessons
from the life and character of Joan of
Arc. Women of America In the twentieth
century are not called upon to lead armies
against a conquering invader. The ene
mies ef American life are within; the
evils of our time â frivolity. Intemperance,
immorality â are foes more deadly than in
vading armies, because Insidious. Is It
not patriotism to maintain the force, the
simplicity, the earnest devotion to truth
and right that ib the past have been the
foundation of American greatness? Is it
not humanity to save men from their evil
ways, to preserve soundness of character?
American women must share with men
the duty of maintaining our national vir
tues. Share with men the duty. Joan
of Arc did not seek to organize a regiment
of women. She placed herself with men.
at their head, sharing their life, yet never
losing womanliness.
This then, in brief, is the lesson â pat
riotism and humanity, devotion to main
taining the noblest elements of American
characterâ not by separate effort of wo
men apart from men, but by co-operative,
fraternal service. x MRM

Another lovely thing Is made of a pal*
pink. The crown Is lifted so that the hat
is raised off the head and the facing
shows, as much if not more, than the
crown. . The facing of this hat, by the
way. Is of pink satin ribbon. Instead of
running lengthwise of the ribbon it is put
on in exactly the opposite way. . Each
piece shows Just where' It is ended, but it
is lapped over the next one so much that
it looks like tiers of ribbon. Running
around the brim a"nd peeping over a little
arc hundreds of 'white and pink apple
blossoms. The entire crown is covered
with a pink chiffon drape* Around thÂ«
edge of the drape are three rows of tfny
silk lace and this lace eecms ' to -try its
best to cover up the apple blossoms and to
get Just a little farther over _the brim
than they are. The chiffon Is laid over
the hat gently and the ends fall down
the back in a perfect Â¦ cloud. A dainty
buckle completes the hat, which is worthy
of Esther Myers" shop. .
Another beautiful evening hat Is made
of blue tulle. The frame is round, but It
is bent on one side to tilt a little over, an
car. There are rows and rows of pleated
tulle, and in fact that comprises the top
of the hat. The facing is .cream lace and
wanders about to the back and is lost
in a huge cream rosette. Â¦ In the center
of the lace and directly. In the center of
the hat is a blue rosette and a large pearl
capsion is the center of it all. It is most
peculiar-looking, but mighty smarti^/The
lace on such a hat is an item in itself,"

f Do tyou happen to know, that linen hats
are to be all the rage? If you do not, you
are distinctly behind the times. The linen
girl had to scurry about last summer and
make a head covering that would look
suitable ; to wear with such, a gown,. but
this summer even ; that has ' been i provided
her. - Of course the entire hat is not linen.
The crown has a; fold of linen and; a fold
of soft blue and white wash -ribbon. The
brim is folded white chiffon and here and

That describes the Eastertide
hats of 19u2. .
Every woman Â«ays that Paris has
sent us her very best, and that
mean* a great deal, you know; that is,'
for hats.
This summer the hats are all large. At
the tame time they are surprisingly love
ly. Just the lightest, breeziest, daintiest
things Imaginable. A breath of wind
would float one away as lightly as it
would a feather, and that is one reason
why everybody has gone so particularly,
hat crazy this year. A light head-cover
ing means bo much to the woman who
spends the most of her time under one,
that when the milliners decree that
weight be all-important, each and every
woman feels like spending every cent she
possesses to buy bonnets, for such bless
ings are few and far between these days
when picture hats are all the rage.
One of lime. Cartier's most stunning
creations is made of white tulle. The tulle
Is gathered on a wire frame which Is
somewhat on the turban order. The en
tire frame, from the rolling brim to the
center of the crown, is literally covered
with cream beads. At the most the pearly
things are not more than an Inch apart,
bo the effect is quite smart. As the hat
rests on the head at an angle, as most
of them do, by the way, all the trimming
is on one side. Rising out of the brim
is the softest, whitest feather pompon and
from the center of that feathery ball are
a myriad of leafy aigrettes. These all
bow low over the rim and partially meet
an immense pearl caption whose duty- It
is to hold nine strands of pearls in place.
These ropes are loose and fall over the
hair, until they are gathered In place
again by another caption. The second
errands are longer than the first, falling
almost to the nape of the' neck when they
are rescued again and finally held tirmly
l>y the third and last caption.' To say
that it Is a dream would be putting It
lightly. The only trouble with it is that
It requires a stunning frock and a swell
occasion to set It off. Otherwise it would
look extremely out of place, and that, in
hats. Is almost the most unfortunate
thing that could happen.

front shades the eyes. There are three
rows of red velvet ribbon, which com

last row is the edge of the brim. The
back of the hat is positively ugly; that is.
when it is in the hand. But when it Is

There are no more gracious curves in
a woman's body than those which start
from the nape of the neck and a woman's
skin is nowhere more delicate than be
tween and just above the shoulder
blades. Under the sharp, shadowed bril
liance of artificial light, the tint is like
that of pearl white satin flushed with' 1 a
faint, rosy glow. Sometimes it is like
living marble in its fineness of grain

A lovely neck and shoulders should be
left to speak for themselves. Oddly
enough, women with really fine necks
have the notion that, by ornament or
trinketry they increase, or at the least
call attention to their beauty. This is
a mistake. The gracious lines of the
shoulders, and the sweep from the nape
of the neck, down the back are broken,
and have their value utterly destroyed
by a necklace.

Blackheads or flesh worms, as they aro
usually called, are a form of acne which
frequently Â¦ affects the ncse. chin and
brow. They are caused by the pores, or
breathing mouths of the skin, becoming
clogged with dust and other particlea of
matter, which irritate, . enlarge, and dis
â¢ tend them. The one cure for these blem
ishes is persistent care and attention. to
the skin.
There are various treatments; the fol
lowing la suggested as" one of\the best:
- At night give the face a thorough wash
ing with warm water â¢ and soap. After
using soap on the face always rinse
with clear water. After drying rub on
the ! affected parts this stimulating lo
tion:
Tincture of capsicum jounce
'Tincture of cantharides 2 drachms
Rosewater 4 ounces
Distilled water 8 ounces
When peace-destroying pimples appear,
apply an ointment mace of one drachm
of flour of sulphur, and one ounce of
benzoated lard.
Another remedy Is:.
Vaseline ". % ounce
Glycerin 1 ounce
tie, containing tue .uiau..ci .. .^r; when
the salts have dissolved, add benzoin
and glycerin. â¢
Directions for using:
Wash the face and hand3 in warm, soft
water, rinse and wipe dry; then pour a
little of the wash, in the palm of the
hand and wet the face with it; leave It
until it begins to feel dry, then rub soft
lv until the face has the appearance of
being powdered; dust off with flannel.
This is also good for an oily complexion,
leaving it soft and white in live minutes
after washing.
Another lotion known to work wonders,
as far as superficial tan is concerned, la
the following:
Chlorate of potassa Vx ounce
To whiten and refresh- the skin after
tan, freckles and . other blemishes have
been removed try any one of the follow
ing preparations:
NO. L
Essence of citron .........3 ounce*
Essence of neroll *4 ounce
Essence of rosemary % ounoo
Essence of roses Tfc drops
Put a few drops In a half-glass of water
when needed, as it is too strong to use
undiluted.

liosewater to make 4 ounces
* NO. 3-CUCUMBER CREAM.
Spermaceti V* ounce
White wax % ounce
Green oil â Vi ounce
Almond oil ...^> ounce
Essence of cucumber l ounco
Melt the spermaceti and wax, add oils
slowly, stirring: constantly, and finally
the essence. Beat until the mixture Is
cold and like cream.
no. 4â cold crea:.i of roses.
Melt together 1 ounce each of white wax'
and spermaceti, adding 4 ounces oil of
almonds, and gradually 4 ounces rose
nuter. Then stir very thoroughly as the
mixture cools, forming a uniform emul
sion.
When washing or treating the face, do
not bend over the basin. A stooping posi
tion is bad for the muscles of the face.
The head should, therefore, be held erect
during manipulation. In massaging, put
on the cream with the finger tips, rub
bins cautiously under the eyes so as not
to move the skin, but pressing harder In
the corners of the eye, where the crows'
feet come, ruhbing the cheeks outward In
stead of inward, and the chin and fore
head upward. Rotation at the base of
the nose and over the nostrils is impor
tant, aa the muscles of that part of the
face are apt to become enlarged and
ugly. Movements should be upward and
outward. A rotary motion with the bands
Is best when washing and drying the face
and when applying emolllenta.
When a number of the blackheads are
removed â do not attempt to do a great
number at one time â the face must bÂ«
washed with warm water. This process
must; be repeated oVery night or two until
the skin is entirely free from any sign
of these unsightly marks. They can be
kept away permanently only on condition
. that the skin be not neglected.
Castor oil % drachm
Glycerin to make 3 ounces
Fellow this treatment for three nights,
the fourth night hold cloths wrung out of
hot water on the face for ten or fifteen
minutes or until the particles of matter
Piling the Inactive pores are softened.
Then each blackhead must be thoroughly
and carefully pressed out (otherwise It

The All-White Gown.
So difficult are these sashes to tie that
they are,. for the most part, made before
they are put on and fastened with a hook
and eye under the bow at the back of
the belt. That Is really the beat way to
manage
Why She Wears a Sash.
The sash^ girl may wear a sash because
it. is fashionable.
She may wear It because she Is flat at
the backâ hollow backed.
She may wear it because It gives
height.
She may wear a sash because a sash
of all things dresses up a gown the most.
Perhaps she wears it because the im
ported Paris gowns nearly all display
them.
Her sash may be a ribbon. one and, for
this purpose, there come ribbons as deli
cate as millinery ribbons, thin mousseline
ribbons and soft figured batiste ones. Per
haps she clings to the liberty and the
panne ribbons or is decorative enough to
want the big flowered affairs that come a
foot wide and sell very 'high.
The made sasrj of the dress material Is
a thing that ' is seen upon the imported
gowns. Its design is very simple. In the
front it is tucked and there are bones
to shape it and give the long point. At
the sides it is rolled into a soft band,
while at the back it is tied In a tiny bow
with two standing loops, but very long
ends. This, though a French sash, is
called the Princess, for the reason prob
ably that It is worn so much with the
Princess gowns, which are so very try
ing without the sash, belt or waist trim
ming of some sort.
The Dutch sash, so called, Is a queer
arrangement In ribbon, with little wind
mill bows afthe" back of the belt. A foot
lower the ribbon is tied In another little
bunch of loops. Â¦ Below this the ends hang
and: there are bunches of loops near the
end: of each.
So runs the topical song. -And this sum
mer the sash girl will be added to the
number. The sash girl is one who al
ways wears a sash. All her gowns are
built for this ornament, and she is never
seen without it. Her reason for wearing
it may be one of several. > .
Finally, in this process of making a
summer gown, came the application of
black satin ribbon to the dress. This was
put' on in rows from the bottom of the
Â¦skirt up to the waist, the rows four inches
apart, so as to stripe the skirt from top
to bottom. The satin ribbon was cun
ningly slipped in under the lace figures,
and the lace lay over them. Probably the
striping was done before the lace leaves
were applied. There was a belt and
stock of white. Â¦ . .
Each summer gown this year is a ro
mance, each an individual dream, wrought
out in wonderful .colors -and exe
cuted with the fidelity of a fine art cre
ation. You cai*'t make one in a day, and
you will do well to get one up in a week,
even with the aid of a seamstress. . But
you can save money on your materials, if
"you cannot on your time. It is just the
season for the making of your own gowns.
Go to work, or be willing to pay the price
the modistes charge. And it Is a fat sum.
"There are all kinds of girlsâ"
Out of some Spanish lace were cut some
flowers, and these were applied to make
a border for the. skirt.- Two rows of them
were set in, one above the other, and
stitched on. In the middle of the front
the flower design I widened and came up
to a great pyramid with the point .at the
very-. belt line, a pyramid of Spanish lace
When the gown was . completed, all
ready to be put on, with each seam sewed
and every finishing touch applied, then
came the real workmanship. .
For the Lily Skirt.
Take such- a gown as has Just been
made for the summer campaign. Its
groundwork, or, better to say, its ma
terial, is a very pale sun-colored batiste,
all yellow, without even one little' satin
dot to help it out. . . â¢ *..
It is made with elbow sleeves, very
tight, a round waist, cut - on the shirt
waist order, and plain, straight skirt of
sweep length, close at the top, gradually
widening into lily shape.
At would pay any summer woman to
give the subject of laundering her flne
gowns careful attention, for the modistes

making of pretty, summer gowns .is the
fact -that they must soil easily and must

"Wnile xio specific claims were made, it
was well understood among the Ways

be placed upon nine Republican members'
of the committee, or just one more than
a majority. Aside from this the inquiries
of the AVaj-s and Means leaders led them
to believe that four and "possibly five'
Democratic votes would be given to the
bill. Their desire, however, had been to
report the measure without any reliance
on the minority, and this they are now
confident of being able Xo do. There was
some prospect, however, of the pairing of 1
members, which might reduce the total
strength on each side, -but in such equal
ratio that the reciprocity measure would
continue to have sufficient Republican
votes to report it without amendment.

FRAME SYSTEM
FOR PHILIPPINES
GETS MAJORITY
FOR CONCESSION
THE DAY'S DEAD.
There; are many circumstances which
rr>ight be cited to strengthen the impres
sion -that', an early change' ts inevitable.
One of the strongest indications that the
President Is not satisfied with the present
condition of affairs at the Interior De
partment is to be found in the fact that
on several occasions recently he ha3
called up cases passed upon by Secretary
Hitchcock and reversed his rulings. In
stead of conferring with the Secretary on
questions relating to the Interior Depart
ment", the President has on more than
one occasion Ignored him and consulted
subordinates without his knowledge.
While there- has never been a close per
sonal friendship between the President
and Hitchcock, the President has been
disinclined to act upon the suggestions re
peatedly made by leading Republicans of
the West urging the .retirement of the
present Secretary of. the Interior. The
light, upon Hitchcock commenced before
President McKinley died, and It la doubt
ful if Hitchcock would have remained
long in the Cabinet had McKinley lived.
While there are no specific ' charges
against Hitchcock .which would justify
his summary removal, it is generally con
ceded that he Is not a popular official. It
is known that the President/is looking the
field over for his successor^ and a num
ber of names have been quietly discussed
by the President Â«and those '.enjoying his
confidence. ._â¢ "- v v
"It begins to look as though Hitchcock
is waiting for a brick house to tumble on
him before he realizes that his absence
from the Cabinet table can be easily en
dured." _ 1; .
A Western Senator, , who Is said to be
urging an .early change in the Interior
Department, In referring to this subject
recently remarked:
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, March 29.-In spite
of persistent denials, the official days of
E. A." Hitchcock as Secretary of the In
terior in President Roosevelt's Cabinet are
numbered. Delicate hints have been re
peatedly dropped to, personal friends of
Secretary Hitchcock that the latter's res
ignation would not be regarded as a seri
ous blow to the administration, but thus
far lie appears to have been too busily
engrossed in other matters to observe
the "typewriting on the wall" which is so
apparent to those who have watched the
somewhat strained relationship between
the administration and Â¦ the Secretary, of
the Interior.

Reierrlng to that part of my: communication
which states that the warfare in the Philip

severity and to the remarks of the honorable
Secretary , on that point, it is proper to . say
that If had in mind such information as is con
veyed in the letter of , Governor W. H. Taft,
addressed to the honorable Secretary, dated
Washington, Feruary 7, 1902, as well as other
communications that have been 'referred to
these headquarters, or received by me.
Concerning my going to the Philippines it
; was my purpose nearly a" year ago to do so,
and'thls was with ths knowledge of the Secre
tary of War and the approval of the, late Pres
ident McKinley, but the Journey. was postponed
in consequence. of the increase in and.reorgani
zation of the army.
.The suggestion contained In my letter that In
going to the Philippine Islands I take certain
natives of Cuba and Porto Rico and on return
ing bring back certain of those of the Philip
pine; Islands was prompted by my belief that
the- result would-be satisfactory to all con
cerned. Since this measure is not deemed ad
visable I do not ask for its lurther considera
tion and, making my delayed visit to the Phil
ippines, which I hope to do in the near future,

SOME POINTED REMARKS.
AVAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON,
March 25, 10C2.â Several weeks after the final
disposition of the : within application by the
action of the President on the Cth of .March,
and after, the. introduction of a resolution . in
Congress calling for. the papers! the lieutenant
general attached to them a statement dated
March 24, 19U2, with the apparant purpose of
showing, that the action taken was wrong.
Without commenting upon the propriety of a
military, officer undertaking ta review the action
of the President, I again submit the paper tor
such reconsideration as the President may think
a , .?v le> with the remarks:
1. 1 he, delegation trom Cuba referred to in
this paper consisted of public officers. with de
nnea powers, charged, with the performance of
a specific duty as official representatives of the
people ot Cuba t^d appointed by the constitu
tional convention* elected by that people. The
t residents consent to receive the committee
was asked for by General Wood through the
becretaiy^of War and was communicated to
General .TSood by the Secretary of War, who
ne\er heard General Miles' name mentioned In
connection with the transaction.
m"i" Â¦Â¦"J*' 18th Â° r J n[ y W00. General
Miles applied to be sent to the Philippines and
to China -in his official capacity. At that timÂ»
ral MaoArthur had reported that not a
single.additional regiment could be spared from
the Philippines without putting our interests
there in Jeopardy, and had shown the reasons
and the gravity O f the situation there In dis
patches which had- passed through General
Miles office. In- the lace of these dispatches
General Miles accompanied his application by
a recommendation that 15.000 troops be with
drawn from the Philippines, and be sent to
?S, n Â»K.',. Â° withdrawal or lS.Ooy troops from
the Philippines would have made necessary the
practical abandonment of a large part of the
country, and the restoration of insurgent con
trol therein. At least two-thirds of the 15.000
were wholly unnecessary in Cnina, unless
for the purpose of. enabling the United States
to furnish a greater number of troops tnan
any/European power and uppn that ecore to
claim the supreme command of the allied
forces. The application and recommendation
were in fact accompanied by a request from
General Miles that such supreme command of
the allied forces should be obtained for him.
Lnder.tKe circumstances, President McKinley
declined to authorize the sending of General
Miles either to the Philippines or to China. A
year afterward the Secretary 'of War author
ized the lieutenant general to extend his in
spection tour to the Philippines tor the pur
pose of inspection only. He has never been
authorized to go for any other purpose. The
question whether the order which the lieu
tenant general asks sending him to ths Philip
pines would Interfere with the present military
and civil control must be determined, net by
what the application says about the order, but
by the terms of the proposed order itself. .The
lieutenant general asks authority "to give
such, directions as I (he) may deem advisable
and Judicious for the best disposition of the-
United States military forces." Â¦ '
That, : of course, Â¦ means to command General
Chaffee, and he asks authority ' 'also to take
such measures as will tend to restore as far
as possible confidence to the people of those
lslands.-^anil demonstrate, that- the purposes of
our Government are prompted by the highest
sense of Justice." â;,.:.', '.-.
That means, if it means anything, authority
to do himself, or .to require the civil officers of
the Philippines to ,do under his direction, the
very duties which were charged upon the Phil
ippine Commission and the Civil Governor In
the islands by President McKinley and which
they are now engaged in doing. The authority
asked is not to recommend, but to take meas
ures. If the measures to be taken are. to be
determined by General Miles.-. then the power
of the commission to determine . upon them
must end. There is no place .for any such au
thority under the present government, and it
It were to be granted the system Â»f civil gov
ernment by which we' have ".gradually and
steadily superseded military control and; have
superseded it throughout â¢ the greater part of
the archipelago, would again be .subordinated
to military power and the! people of the islands
would be subjected to the arbitrary control
of amflitary dictator. ; UÂ£ '."â¢-.' Â¦Â¦â¢ ' 1 :!;* ;:..',

The reference in the . memorandum to ' the
letter of Governor Taft to - the Secretary' of
War. dated February 7, 1902; â¢ is- to a- - letter
transmitting, for the purpose of investigation
by the military- authorities, a report by the
Civil . Governor , of the â¢ province Of Tayabas,
containing in general terms and without speci

military/ administration .in that- province 'and
against the conduct of the" army generally in
its relations to the civil Government! '- This re

Cubans and Porto Ricans to the Pnilippines,'
or by bringing delegations from the Philippines
to the United States, in advance of the choice
of olflcial delegates provided lor by the bill
now pending In Congress. On the other hand
it would be very dltticult to keep such a pro
ceeding free from spectacular and sensational

It is not the fact that the warfare in the

severity; on the contrary the warfare lias been
conducted with marked humanity and mag
nanimity on the part of the United States

I append hereto a list of twenty-three of
ficers of the Insurrectionary government who

The conduct cf .military affairs in the Phil
ippines by General-- Chattee and his predeces
sors and 'the conduct of civil affairs by. Gov
ernor Taft ana his associates in the Philip
pines Commission, have been able and succeso
fui. Much more rapid progress has been rnaae
toward the complete - acceptance of American
sovereignty, the, restoration of peace and the
establishment of clvU government tiian we ha<i
any right to anticipate when the treaty of
peace of Paris was ratified. Tne piau pro
posed In the within paper involves practically
bupergeding the officers mentioned in the-ecn
trul which they now exercise. Not uuly is this
without justincation in their conduct, but I
should regard it as a most unfortunate inter
ference or the .'present satisfactory Â¦ progress.
There have been exceedingly full, extended and
long continued consultations under counsel be
tween the Government of the United States and
leaders of opinion among; the insurrectionary
Filipinos, resulting in a .full understanding anj
most friendly feeling betiVeen by far the great
er portion of the Filipino beople and ourselves,
ana a participation by many members of the
Agulnaldo government in the civil government
under 'American government.

Should this. request be approved, I am 1 con
fident it would result in. a better condition of

To Prove What Swamp-Root, the World-Famous Kidney and Bladder Remedy*
Will Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Call May Have a Sample Bottle Free.
; . Gentlemen â In justice .to you, I feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the sample
bottle of Swamp-Root you so kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past five years with kidney and blad-
der, trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me for the time being, but the old com-
. plaint-would in a short time return again. I sent for a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, and I found it did me a world
: of good. " Since then I have taken eight small bottles bought at my drug store, and I consider myself perfectly cured. v
It seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping. I do not have the smarting and irritation, nor do I
have to get up during the night. to urinate, as I formerly did three or four times a night, but now sleep. the sleep of
peace. My back is all right again, and in every way I am a new man. Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-
Root. . They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise of it. It is a boon to mankind. We.recommcnd it to all who
are suffering from kidney and bladder diseases.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the blessing you
have brought to the human race in the compounding of Swamp-Root. JAMES COOK.

practice, and is. taken by doctors themselves, because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound. Â«-.,..,_ , T Â»_" ,.

Great Britain and France Are
Also Invited to Join in
Congress.
Special Dispatch to The Cali.
Congress Is Proposed.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
Â¦W., WASHINGTON, March 29.â Germany
has asked the United States to join in, an
international - movement designed to pre
vent a monopoly in wireless telegraphy.
Her proposal is Identical with that sub
mitted to Great. Britain. She has not,
however, confined. her representations to
these two nations. . The whole world baa
been invited to take common measures
under which all the systems will be re
quired to exchange messages. Â¦ The . Ger
man proposal s to this Government was
submitted, to Secretary Hay a few days
ago by Embassador von Holleben. In a
formal memorandum the Embassador
mentioned the efforts -. of the con
trollers of the Marconi system to
establish - a monopoly 'in- wireless
telegraphy which was prejudicial to other
systems; among them the Slaby-Arco,
which 'is In use in Germany's navy. To
prevent this monopoly Germany proposes
an international agreement which snail
accord equal lights to all systems.
Considerable satisfaction was expressed
in official circles with the action of Ger
many. Secretary Hay assured Embassa
dor von Holleben that the proposal of nla
Government would receive the serious
consideration which lt deserves. The Sec
retary was unwilling to make a more
definite reply because he desired to con
sult technical experts of. the United State3
armyand navy. In order to prevent any
embarrassing complications, however. It
was conceded ' that lt mignt be a good
plan to have Congress place a^w upon
the statute books which would regulate
the operation of wireless telegraphy. This,
it is suggested, would be a step in tne
direction of. international control, for Â¦ it
would give the executive an indication or
how far Congress desires him to commit
the United States in an International ar
rangement. So far as International con
trol Is concerned it is suggested that tnere
should be incorporated m the- agreement
reached a provision prohibiting the use of
powerful instruments for long distances
when they interfered with systems oper
ated over short distances. The idea of
wireless telegraphy experts of the army
and navy is to avoid lnterterence an much,
as possible. They believe emphatically
that there should be no monopoly of wire
less telegraphy by one system, and that
there should be general approval of Ger
many's proposal that all systems 'be re
quired ' to exchange messages.
Marconi's Explanation.
BERLIN, March 29.â Professor Slaby s
recent proposal for an International con
ference to regulate wireless telegraphy Is
already engaging the attention of Ger
many, the authorities of which country
are now drafting a circular note to be
presented to the United States. Great
Britain and France proposing a congress
far the purpose of agreeing upon a means
to prevent a monopoly of wireless teleg
raphy on the high seas. . Â¦ * . Â¦ '
According to - the statements printed
here, the step is a direct consequence of
the reported refusal of the wireless sta
tion at Nantucket to , receive a message
from Prince Henry on board tho Ham
burg-American steamer Dcutschland. The
statement 'cabled from Berlin to New
York that Germany had sent a protest to
the' British Government against the Mar
coni .people's .boycott against ships
equipped' with' the Slaby-Arco apparatus
Is discredited hero. HtRh officials of- the

Arco and the refusal of the Marconi com
panies to allow, unless by previous, ar
rangements with them, communication
between the Marconi land stations and
ships equipped with any system claiming
to bo different from hia system. Blgnor
Marconi goes on to say:
', I wish to state that such refusal has been
and will continue to be made. I cannot '.take
the responsibility Â¦ of advising my companies,
which during the last four years have
expended large sums on the erection of land
statiors, to enter Into any agreement such a3
suggested, which would practically secure to
Dr. Slaby and his coadjutors advantages in the
cost of which they had borne no part and to
which they are in no way . entitled so long as

book. "Stories for Children," an edition

merit and contains forty-three pages.
This juvenile uuthor Is the son of Joseph
A. Lotz. the County Treasurer.
Cyril Lotz is a student at the Wash
burn School, and looks much younger

manifested great interest in composition
work, and Instead of rushing off with
other boys to play ball he read book after
book of stories. The six tales ln the book
show . much familiarity with , current
events. Two or three of them are mod
eled on the fairy tale pattern, and the
rest are interesting compositions on
school life. -'Â¦-. . 'â¢Â¦

Geyer, liquor dealers at Main and Win
ston streets, reported to the police to
day that their place had been entered on
Thursday night and nineteen United
States bonded warehouse certificates, for
five barrels of whisky each, stolen. As
the certificates are made out in the
firm's name, they can be negotiated only
by forging the - name. The certificates
represent about $10,000 worth of liquor
and the thieves evidently went to the
place with the intention of stealing these
alone, as nothing else was molested.

SAN RAFAEL. March 23.-Although
Sam Rafael is beins patrolled by special
policemen and detectives are on watch
every night, the nrebue seems to disre
gard all precautions. The William Tell
House, a Swiss resort, under the manage â¢
metn of J. Albert!, was marked for de
struction *ome time last night. The
house R-as entered and kerosine Mberally
scattered over some mattresses and blan
kets in the hall. It was presumed by the
proprietor that the only reason that his
place wa3 not destroyed was that some
boarder entered the hall and frightened
away the incendiary. The criminal es
caped by the rear through a small veg
etable garden, his footprints being plain
ly dtscÂ«-rnab!c ln the soft dirt. The
tracks are those .of a man wearing about
a No. fc ihcft.

SAN RAFAEL'S FIBEBTJQ
SCARED FROM HIS TASK
This route was linally agreed upon after
a number of preliminary surveys had
been made. It establishes a uniform
grade of about lVs per cent. This will in
sure much faster transportation, and,
while the undertaking is one Incurring
enormous expense, the future saving by
the company also will be great. The new
tunnel will be lighted by electricity.
Considerable improvements will be made
by the company in Nevada, and if all the
railway extensions are bunt this year the
total mileage will be a record-breaker,
bcveral contracts for the reconstruction
at th<; Contra I Pacllic between Wads
wonh and Ogden wore let last Wednes
day, making a total of twelve contract t>
up to date. The latest contracts call for
the bunding of two hundred miles of rail
road at a total cost of J5.1bO,OW. Most of
the contractors are at work and there are
MW more than 2C'XÂ» men and more than
UOo teams employed. Where very heavy
cuts are bcir.i; made day and night force*,
nrc at work, as many of the contractors
have hud electric lights installed. Steam

It 1* said th;.t by the middle of next
May an army of 70u0 graders will be cm
p.oyc-d along the Central Pacific. The
J,Â»rt r ' Jil , ,\> V Â°P'- V . w "ant to pet the heaviest
l-fV'S â¢ nc . work i n lhls Slal Â« and Utah
finished by the end of the year. The cut
off acropfl the north end of the Great Salt
Lake will require much longer time
The survey for the tunnel brings its
wett end on tne Yuba. north of Soda
Springs station. Leaving the tunnel on
the w*'ft, the line comes down a gorge in
the New Hampshire rocks and follows
down the west side of the Yuba, crossing
the flat at Cisco, near Iron Spring. It
will bo necessary to run another tunnel
lrom the Yuba Valley into Bear Valley,
and tbe road will pass back of Emigrant
Gap, some 400 feet above Bear River.
The new survey, which has been com
pleted, leaves the main line at Rocklln.
A tunnel passes through Boulder Ridge;
thence the line goes up Dutch Ravine,
west cf Newcastle. Auburn Ravine is
crossed below the Stone House after the
line tunnels through the point at Bloomer
Ridge. The survey passes a short dis
tance west of Auburn and intersects the
main line near Clipper Gap. The present
grade from Clipper Â«iap to Colfax is con
sidered batistuctury, although a vast
amount or work win be done in cutting
cut curves. Â¦'-â¢'.',''
The proposed work of the company la
of extreme interest to trans-California
travelers and involves a question of time
In transportation. It will cost millions of
dollars and will consume years in con
struction. Now that the survey has been
finished, specifications will be made Im
mediately and contracts let. The new
route over me mountains will necessitate
the tearing up of many miles of track
and will tollow directions much at vari
ance with the old. It is expected, If the
plans of the railroad company are con
summated, that ground will be broken
before the end of the year.
AUBURN. March 29.â The corps of
Bouthern Paclilc surveyors and engineers,
has Just completed the burvey for the new
tunnel through the Sierra, which will be
one of the longest In the world. Accord-
Ing to the records of the survey It will
be 6 miles and K00 feet In length. It will
chn.inatu nearly 1000 feet of grade and
will reduce .the length of snuwsheds -S

PERSONAL MENTION.
Such being the case the advice;bf the Mayor, and of the Labor Council is the best that
could have been given.. It is both i wise, and timely. It tends to conserve the interests of the pub
lic without sacrificing any 'right or waiving any claim the street-car employes may have, and if it
be followed will win for them the approval of the public. I ir' :
It is to be borne in mind that the new company comes to the city with a record; acquired
by the management of roads in other cities which gives good 'reason for the" expectation of
beneficial changes in our street-car service. Improvements have been promised wherever thev . can
'be advantageously 'made. Among them will doubtless be some system of providing a better under
standing between the higher officers of the road and the employes. Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â£}&&'&
By postponing their demands upon the company until the new, management' enters upon
control of the lines the car men wilhlpse nothing. They wil! in. tact gain in public sympathy bv
attesting their fairness and i heir willingness to^ conserve the general welfare â¢ by the Â¦ exercise
of patience arid tact rather, than to rush into a: strike and so inflict -hardship aipon people who
are in no 'wise responsible for the action of the street-car management. 1 W\ .. â¢ -,
The street-car employes cannot be ignorant of the high importance of their work to the
community and particularly' to workingmen. By reason of the 'facilities for rapid transporta
tion the workingmen of modern cities frequently live far away from the shops and localities
where they are employed. By making their homes in the suburbs or in parts of the city distant
from the business and industrial center they are enabled to live with better surroundings and at
a less expense for rent. To maintain homes. in those localities, however, while at the same time
reporting promptly for^work, it is essential that the street car service shall be at all times regular
and reliable. Were the cars tied up for any considerable number of days, the workingmen of the
city would be seriously embarrassed in going to and from their homes and. their -work, and to
many of them the embarrassment? might mean a heavy loss which they can ill afford to bear.
At the present time the Market-street Railway Company is passing through a sort of in
terregnum. The old company has transferred the lines to a new -company, but the new has not vet
taken active charge of the operation of the roads. There is no, one now in official control of the
lines who is vested with authority to act or even speak for the new owners. Consequently were a
strike ordered at once it would tie up the street cars for. a, long time, since there is no one on the
spot to, negotiate terms with the strikers. Even were, a compromise effected by the present ad
ministration of the lines it would not be binding upon the new administration, and therefore
would be of but a fleeting value to the car men or to the public.
GOOD counsel has been given by Mayor Schmitz and by the San Francisco Labor
Council to the street- car employes' with reference to their controversy with the Mar
ket-street Company. Both the Mayor and the Council advise the car ..men not to
precipitate a strike at this time, but to await the transfer of the lines into the hands of
the new management which is soon to take charge; and there can be no questioning the sound'
ness of the grounds upon which the advice is" based. ' :

"Ahâ Jefferson, or Mansfield?" I hesi

WELL-KNOWN ACTOR .WHO
SAYS "HAMLET" IS TOO
Mated with these tableaux of tone is the
elocutionary rendition t of portions from the
original poem so selected, as. to give the story
entire. At .tlme3 the voice of the reader Is
alone; at times the music only is heard; and
again, the reader's half -chanted cadences and
the Ecund-sumrestlon ! -ere blended each to
each. The reading explains tha music as the
music Interprets the readingâ the one being th?
perfect complement of the other.
Perhaps the two most beautiful pictures are
Annie's dream, with the sweep of harps lightly
flashing as from a vague golden dawn, and
long alter Enoch's death when tones melt Into
tones, rise Into the soaring fervor of praeter
human renunciation, sink to the speech of
wrecked lips and glow .into heroic suggestion
as the life ia set free.
The listener, catches first the unmistakable
roar, of the sea"" dashing spray against the cliff
lines of Enoch's village. Even now surely may
be heard the overwhelming sadness of Enoch's
fate svrellins out from the instrument at the
first mention In the poem of .Enoch's name.
One catches also the charm and gentleness of
Annie, first. In daintily playful cadence, then
more deeply, portentously, as loneliness and
poverty r>re*s close about.
Strauss .himself has. called it "Melodrama
for the Pianoforte." It Is In reality a eerMs
of descriptive tone pictures knit together by
the â¢wordinr of. Tennyson's poem. Its har
monic richness and intensity are such that
under the bands of a true artist it may be
given an effect well nigh deceptively orches
tral. At the same time the themes are of a
clearly deansd melodic nature, ineffably sweet
and â¢ penetrating, like, the atmosphere of the
story. Â¦ â¢*' .'; ....
Richard Strauus* "Enoch Arden" is a musi
cal conocsition of so novel conception that
considerable difficulty has been experienced in
securing for It a title at once comprehensive
and explanatory. It differs in plan, idea and
manner of development from any musical form
hitherto employed by any composer.
Up to now we have had here In San
Francisco exactly one song out of all this
wealth, a "Serenade" given by Mme. Nor
dica. This week somewhat repairs the
deficiency. We have Max and Julia Hein
rich. those clever and sound artists, with
"Enoch Arden," to be given next Tuesday
evening at Sherman &. Clay Hall. Ac
cording to the interest awakened in this
event will be the likelihood of another
part Strauss programme, to Include eleven
Strauss songs that will later be given If
the "melodrama" creates Its legitimate
stir. Also "Enoch Arden" may form part
of Saturday afternoon's programme. The
second concert is on Thursday evening
and will number five songs by E. A. Bru
glere on Its programme. The programme
has this to say of the melodrama:

there to become director of the Munich
Court Theater, leaving that post in 1890
at a call from Weimar. Later he became
Court Kapellmeister at the Berlin opera,
and has done much brilliant conducting
In other fields, âfor which detail I am In
debted again to Mr. Huneker. Up to date
the last published list of Strauss' works
included eleven orchestral compositions:
Festival March, op.. 1;. Serenade for wind
instruments, op. 7; First Symphony,, op.
12; From Italy, op. 16; Don Juan, tone
poem. op. 20; Macbeth, tone poem, op. Â£3;
Tod u. Verklarung, tone poem, op. 24;
Till Eulenspiegel. op. 2S; Alsosprach Zara
thustra, op. 30; Don Quixote, op. 35, and
Heiden'eben,' op. 40.- Then there are
eighty-five songs, some with orchestral
accompaniment; .a sonata for piano, op.
5; a violin and piano sonata, op. 18; a
'cello and piano sonata, op. 8, and a con
certo for violin and piano. There,' are
three sets qf piano compositions, five
pieces, op. 3; Stimmungsbilder, op. 9, and
Burleske for piano and orchestra, op. 49.
There is a concerto for the French horn,
two string quartets, seven male choruses,
and lastly an opera, "Guntram," and a
"melodrama" for voice and piano, "Enoch
Arden."
" 'Hamlet* ls.too easy," was the aston
ishing rejoinder. "Pray do not misunder
stand. I mean that the audience in 'Ham
let* Is with one from the first. He is such
a lovable^ chap that. you have not" the
task of winning sympathy for tho char
acter, and uny one of a decently pleasing
personality must meet with some measure
of success in the part. Then Hamlet's
moods are so complex that he is a very
tool marksman who cannot hit some Â¦ of
"There have been as many Shylocks as
men who have played the part, one fash
ion. of conception after another, varying
with. the era," agreed the actor; "why
not a twentieth century Venice usurer?
We all belong to our day, ijaevltably, and
the type Is an eternal one."::
"Does not 'Hamlet' also beckon?" I in
quired. \
"I don't seem to fit you into those parts^
Mr. Morgan," I said. "You seem the very
essence of modernity." .
"What would I like to do? Why. what
all< the big men have done. I should first
like to try 'Shylock,' then 'Macbeth'â not
to be at all diffident." ..
: With a laugh showing the handsome
Morgan teeth, and without a hint of the
Morgan clenchâ which is mostly forgotten
in conversationâ the actor described a sig
nificant circle with his capable white
hands, looked me up anil down and said:
' ."'The Eternal City," probably," said the
actor, "though there are a few weeks
between the tour of 'The Christian*, and
the production of .'The Eternal City' that
I may fill in with something, else."
"What would you do if you might choose
âto ask a modest aueation?"
"What next?"
â¢ "I went on the stage to make a living.
Of,, course I 'was always fond of It, but
that was the immediate Incentive. You
see, I came to America some twelve years
ago, to Chicago, and while working In a
store there used to 'supe' occasionally for
fun. Yes," with a merry and most un-
Storm-like mischlevousness, "I have as
sisted Lawrence Barrett, Mansfield and
other famous stars and have been pro
foundly surprised at . their . inability to
recognize my commanding talents under
the bushel of a tin helmet or, footman* a
wig. For two years the^ stage invited me
in vain. Then, as I said before. I went
broke and the footlights came with new
appeal Into my horizon. Since then I
have been with the Frohmans, with vari
ous stock companies, and now I am with
the unsyndlcated Liebler people. '<
"Then?"
"So far as the American stage will per
mit," laughed the actor. We were sitting
in the little cage where the voluble boy
nightly swaps opera glasses for 25-cent
pieces and Mr. Morgan looked rather
large for his Quarters.
"How did it happen?"
"My being on the stage? Simple enough.
I got broke," Mr. Morgan said.
Beyond v what Laura Jean calls an "in
teresting pallor,", '. Mr. Morgan does not
look at all like a night owl. There is a
good six feet of him and a proportionate
breadth, a light, clear blue eye that
comes surprisingly with the darkness of
his brown hair, and lips o? a Rossettl
redness that stands out strikingly against
the aforesaid Interesting pallor. It is a
well-drawn head, set cleanly upon a pair
of young, massive shouldersâ that set me
wondering as to what would happen to
Jittle Miss Leslie if the incumbent John
Storm ever "played to the limit" in tfie
scene where he attempts Glory's life. Al
together, in his well-cut gray and black
tweeds, withâ for the matinee girl's bene
fitâa black and red tie, and blue and
white impassionate cuffs, Mr. Morgan
looks just the big. healthy Englishman
\hat he is, with perhaps a need of the for
gotten morning sunshine to - touch the
portrait to complete conviction.
"You are English?" I asked, for though
there was little doubt in my mind, a cer
tain softness of the Morgan accent be-
Fpoke another influence.
"Yes, Welsh, that is," Mr. Morgan re
plied. "Aberystwith has the honor of be
ing my birthplace. South Wales, you
know." and. I remembered then the
"Johnny; Jones and Oswald Morgan." of
the famous Welsh Eisteddfod ballad.

PERHAPS there Is no suggestion
of provincialism that . one repels
more vigorously than that of early
rising, both for one's self and one's
adored San Francisco. Therefore,
when E. J. Morgan's irreproachable six
feet strode Into the Columbia Theater at
1 p. m. the other day to meet me.
I managed quite a decent smothered
yawn, to match his of the very genuine
Gotham variety. Profusely apologetic,
but I fear still hungry. Mr. Morgan ex
plainedâhe was a little lateâ that he had
been annexing a cup of coffee In a nearby
restaurant and the clock was slow.
That It was tremendously earlyâ wasn't
It? I agreed, with patriotic forgetfulness
of the plebeian stretch of sunny hours
that lay behind me. But San Francisco
did get up a little earlier than New York?
Still, it was a "bully" place. Of course,
In New York one had one's chief meal
after the performance and that meant a
couple of hours for the process of assimi
lationâusually conducted at the Lambs*
Club, or any of a dozen other places, and
1 knew what that meant. He must own
to being -a "night owl" he supposed, but
I would forgive his lateness? and with a
particularly attractive smile the week's
John Storm made hjs peace.
RICHARD STRAUSS is a man cf
jjenius; perverse, tumultuous, rad
ical, morbid, bitten by wrong
headed theoriesâ yet a genius. But
S6 years old, he has in his brief ar
tistic life summed up all schools, all
styles, and has planted victorious stand
ards on new ambiguous territory. Pre
cocious as Mozart or as Chopin. Strauss
nevertheless lacked Individuality until his
twentieth opus; though signs were not
lacking in the early compositions to as
eure the acute, interested critic that a
new man was at hand. Von Bulow felt
the paw of the young lion when he saw
Opus 7, the serenade for wind instru
ments ; and Alexander Bitter, recognizing
the gifts of the youth, pointed out to him
the way wherein he would prosper ar
tistically. The interior force we call
genius, which Goethe named his daemon,
accomplished the rest. Richard Strauss
In Germany to-day "is emperor of the or
chestra."
So wrote James Huneker, American
sponsor of Strauss, two years ago, of this
largest figure on the twentieth century
musical horizon. To-day Mr. Huneker
epeaks in less mlstakable terms, surer of :
the vision and voice of this modern
prophet of orchestral art, of his reach and
relation to absolute music As with Beet
hoven, royal revolutionary of five score
years ago; as with Wagner, the great her
etic of the last century, so Strauss to-day
Is regarded as the arch anarch of the art
musical, a religion to the illuminati, a
rebellion to the mass. Yet he has many
followers, and 'of these, it seems, that fol
lowing that is best worth having. He
has already arrived at the dignity of at
tention from the pamphleteer, and is be
ing explained, dogmatized about and en
veloped hn the mystery that always
shrouds the new thing in art. By one he
Is bailed as the musical Messiah, and wel
comed by a lesser pagan as the Lucifer
of harmony. To ears Initiate his har
monies touch the intimate heart of music,
lo others shut to his appeal he seems the
past master of cacophony. Hear Mr.
Huneker again on the particular, Strauss
genius:
"Richard Strauss Is the most Intel
lectual of living musicians. Salnt-Saens
pointed out over a decade ago the master
part harmony would play in the music of
the future, and Strauss realized that mel
ody no longer sovereign in the King
dom of Tone; his master works are mar
vels, yet, raelodlcally, no new thing is
said. In structure, in rhythmical com
plexity, in striking harmonies, ugly, bold,
brilliant, dissonantal, his symphonic
poems are without parallel. Berlioz
never dared, Lizst never drearned, such
miracles of polyphony, a polyphony beside
which Wagnet's la child's play, and
Bach's is out-rivaled. And this learning,
this titanic brush-work on vast and
scmber canvases, are never for music's
eake; indeed, one may ask if it is really
music, and not new hybrid art. It is al
ways intended to mean something, say
something, paint some one's spul; it is
a half-mad attempt to make absolute mu
eic articulate. â¢ â¢ * Of mere sensuous
or decorative music-making there Is none.
Strauss is ever beset by the Idea; whether
dramatic, metaphysical or romantic
lyric, the idea takes precedence of _the
sound that accompanies it. So there^is
UtUe pretense of form, little thought of
vocal exigencies (Mr. Huneker . here
speaks of the Strauss lleder). while the
piano accompaniments are the most dif
ficult ever written." *
A little of Strauss the man. Richard
Strauss, first of all. Is not of the famous
Viennnese \raltz kings, but is the son of
a horn player of Munich. He is now 3G
years old, "tall and slight, with a large,
finely developed head and long, spidery
arms. Very blond, with big. fatigued blue
eyes, he is outwardly the typical Scandi
navian. The brow is both bold and re
flective; the general bearing of the man
self-controlled and masterfuL Decidedly
a personality of a twentieth century
Ubennensch." He played the* piano at
4 years of age and composed at 6. He
began to study composition at 10. in 1875,
violin and piano training going before,
and three of his songs were sung in 1880.
His first symphony, written in his fif
teenth year and still unpublished, was
given a hearing. Von Bulow then became
attracted to the clever youngster and put
the Serenade (for thirteen wind instru
ments) Into the Mcinlngen orchestra re
pertory, and In his twentieth year Strauss
Â¦became music director at Meiningen.
Here he met Alexander Hitter, by whom
and by Von Bulow he was powerfully in
fluenced, and also made his debut as
pianist. Von Bulow conducting. "\ He suc
ceeded Von Bulow in the Meiningen chair.
ijj JSS6 Strauss left Meiningen for Munich,
CLEVER SOUND ARTISTE WHO
WILL BE HEARD IN CONCERT
AT SHERMAN & CLAY HALL.
After listening to such an inflammatory harangue some man goes forth and strikes a blow
at his fellow-man. Arrest, trial and condemnation follow. Two homes have been broken up. In
one there is lamentation for a husband slain; in the other a heart-broken mother weeps over a
son whose life. has been flighted 'by. the commission of crinie and who goes td a f elon ? s doom.
Meantime, the excitement having blown over, the clerical demagogue whose falseand flaming or
atory fired the spirits that : .committed the crime, sits in his study, fat, 'rosy, whistling, well pleased
with the reputation he A has made, and never thinks of ministering to the grief of either home. His
only thought is that of getting a chance to. make another speech where he will be free from, the
restraints of the pulpit and the high requirements of truth. .
Throwing exaggeration to the winds and resorting to direct falsehoods, the clerical dema
gogue screams out that the employers of laborin America are seeking to turn wage earning into
slavery and to reduce the mass of the people to want, wretchedness and political degradation. With
vehement fury he calls upon the idle to, rise, to strike a blow, to fight. He tells them it is cow
ardice to keep the peace, that it will be valor to break the law.
Nor is it strange that outbreaks of violence should so frequently follow the harangue's of
the irresponsible agitators who leave the pulpit and the peace of the church, to enjoy the/thrill
and the excitements of the stump and the mob. Such orators have been known to taiim and
sting American audiences by teliing them they are ruled over by domineering plutocrats; that
they are being robbed of their earnings, forced into serfdom, lashed into subjection, brutalized,
trampled on and crushed into slavery and cowardice, and reduced to a condition worse than that
of the slaves of old Rome by a money power more greedy and more 'heartless than N,gro.
The evils wrought by the wild utterances of these seekers after mischief and notoriety are
far-reaching and affect many, but they work their direst wrong and harm in .the households, of
those who are most susceptible to the mad teaching. Mothers! wives, sisters and children^have
had bitter cause to repent and mourn that the men of their families have been too ready to act
upon the declamatory utterances of such orators. Many a weeping woman has seen some loved
one hurried into crinie and borne away to prison, knowing in her heart that the real guilt rested
not with the excited man who struck the blow, but with the vindictive', malignant, reckless dem
agogue in clerical garb whose words roused him to madness and impelled. him to. crime.
Of all orators at such, times those who are most, dangerous are the clerical demagogues
who feeling they will not be involved in the fighting, and having nothing to lose by anything
that may happen, give free rein to , the on-rushing wildness of their eloquence and urge;per^
suade, exhort and impel excitable men to open riot or secret crime. The very dignity of his call
ing which should have been a restraint upon the clerical demagogue is used by him as a means "
to make his. words more dangerous. With cunning skill he weaves into his harangue 1 ! quotations
from Holy Writ, speaks now as a pastor of the people and now as a revolutionist, owpg allegi
ance to nothing r The unreflecting listeners, burning with the flaming blaze of lurid rhetoric,'
cannot distinguish between the pastor and the demagogue, the ;Bible and blasphemy. They ac
cept all as the teaching of an institution they have been taught to revere from childhood; and
in a whirl of passion are led to violate the long established and well-known precepts of the /
, church by the very distortions which the clerical agitator ntakes of his clerical influence.
The power of oratory over excited minds is well known. When a whole community is dis^
turbed, when for a time respect for law wavers and men begin to believe that lawlessness may
be justifiable, when bitterness increases daily between contending factions, when the reckless are
stimulated by the contagious influences of large crowds,' then the duty of an orator becomes a
most serious and responsible one. An inflammatory speech uttered by one having some show of
authority may set fire to the spirits of the mob and precipitate a riot, when calmer and wiser
â¢words might have restored respect for law, and re-established th*e harmony that is necessary for
AMONG the evil ways into which restless and ill-balanced orators ""of the church too
readily stray is that of playing the demagogue and the agitator in times'of popular' ex
citement. Eager for the glory of leadership and feeling, no sense of responsibility to the
duties of their hign calling, such men rush to the front at meetings where discontented
men are gathered, and with something of frenzy^ in word and manner they rouse and madden the
more reckless or more sensitive of the mob until some of them, as ill-balanced as the clerical ora
tor himself, but more prone to blows than to speech, rush away to the* commission of crime.

Mrs. -Hittell is a handsome woman anil
has considerable musical talent, being the
pianist of the UkSah Symphony Orches
tra. She brings, suit for absolute divorce,
$25 .-a month alimony and $100- attorney's
fees. She charges extreme cruelty and al
leges that at divers times and places the
defendant struck and choked her, called
her bad names and otherwise abused her.
A half dozen specific instances of cruelty
are stated in the complaint, one of the
latest, being alleged to have occurred in
a Ukiah. ch6p house known as "Jack's,"*
where, it is charged, Hittell struck and
choked his wife in the presence of wit
nesses, who are named.
About three years ago he opened an
office in Ukiah, he and his wife residing
here with Mrs. Reed: but- some months
ago he v/ent to San Francisco, leaving his
wife and child here,, presumably until he
could get started in business.
The defendant, Frank T. Hittell, is a
young lawyer and Is a son of Theodore
H. Hittell, the well known San' Francisco
attorney, law writer and historian. He Is
now in San Francisco, where he has been
for several . months past.
UKIAH, March 29.â A complaint was
filed in the Superior Court here yesterday
which is the first step in what probably
will prove to be a sensational divorce
case.- It will certainly be so if contested
by the defendant. The plaintiff is Mrs.
Susan Hittell, a daughter of Mrs. Anna
Morrison Reed, who Is not unknown to
fame in California as a poet, lecturer and
contributor to various publications. Sev
eral years ago Mrs. Reed published a vol
ume of poems which received the com
mendation of many of the prominent men
of the State.

WILMINGTON, W. Va., March 29.â
Sensational reports were received here to
day concerning another fight with thÂ«
Hatflelds, In which four men were'killed,
among them being Harry Watts, pro
prietor of the Palace Hotel here.
John Rutherford, a detective, had a
warrant for the arrest of Epnraim Hat
field, who is wanted in South Carolina.
He finally located Hatfleld in Pike
County, Kentucky. - Watts went with
Rutherford and they found Ephraim at
the home of his father, Thompson Hat
fleld, on Blackberry Creek.
- Rutherford and Watts broke in the door,
and secured ' Ephraim, when the father
opened flre on them. Both officers and
both Hatttelds were killed. The wife and
little children witnessed the tragedy.
The Rutherfords were relieved of
"Cap" Hatfield of feud fame. Rutherford
was a brother of the two Rutherfords
killed at the election in 1896 by "Cap"
Hatfleld. Watts was well known
throughout the southern part of' the
State. He was wealthy and popular. It
is said he could have Â«aved himself had
he not stopped firing for a moment when
one of the Hatfleld children was within
his range.
The excitement among the feudists is- as
great as at the time of the burning of the
McCoys at the stake by the Hatfields
years ago and more trouble is expected.

family were drowned.
In most instances the victims were ne

CRUELTY CHARGE
AGAINST HiTTELL
Â«ttle homes of prominent ladies, j She al
ways did well, for 510 is cheap for the
secret of how to turn backward the hands
of time with carrots at the prevailing
market price. About the time the hus
bands of the madame' s disciples began to
rebel against the raw carrot diet. and to
frequent the "free lunch routes" Mme.
Davenport went to Santa Barbara.
Mme. Davenport lectured to "circles" in
At the inception of her class the . ma
dame created consternation by refusing
to accept the checks of some of her
"pupils," who, being wives of bank presi
dents and capitalists, had their own bank
accounts; but Mrs. Severance ended the
trouble by guaranteeing the entire
amount. In that class were Mrs. Mark
Sibley Severance, Mrs. W. C. Patterson,
Mrs. R. W. PoindeXter, Miss Wills and
others.
The madame impressed upon her dis
ciples the need of using grated raw car
rots for the three meals of the day, and
feeding the same vegetable to their hus
bands. If the husbands would stand for
that kind of food it proved their love.
For a time after Mme. Davenport's com
ing to town bankers and merchants and
real estate men were eating nothing but
raw carrots at home.
LOS ANGELES, March 23.â Many Los
Angdles club women are deeply shocked
to learn that Mme. Charlotte Davenport
has been -arrested in Santa Barbara.
When the madame 'was in Los Angeles
she undertook to get up a "class" of fifty
women to attend a series of her lectures
at the Friday Morning Club house.""- She
did not get quite the required fifty, but
she collected a class that satisfied her.
She promised for the $10 fees to tell the
women how they could dispose of twenty
or thirty years of their apparent age. Her
method was simply to eat plenty of raw
carrots.
Mrs. Davenport appeared before the
Woman's Club to-day to lecture on physi
cal culture and the spacious building wai
filled to its doors with the elite of Santa
Barbara, probably attracted by the ex
pectation of hearing sensational charges
made against the Rev. Frank S. Forbes,
pastor of the First Congregational Church
of this city/ _
.-. In the course of an interview. Mrs. Da
venport made several pointed references
to the friendship of Rev. Mr. Forbes lor
Mrs. Dunshee. Explaining the events
preceding her arrest, she said she had
contracted to beautify the figure Qf Mrs.
Dunshee- by means of. physical culture.
After a week's treatment no great devel
opment was noticeable and the Rev. Mr.
Forbes, being informed of the treatment,
objected seriously and' advised 1 her arrest.
"When v Mrs. Davenp"ort was speaking of
her contract with Mrs. Dunshee she
threw back her cloak, and, displaying her
splendid figure, exclaimed:
"This has been done by my system of
physieal culture, so you can see that the
charge, of obtaining money under false
pretenses is perfectly absurd." " v
. She spoke of those who were her ene
mies as being on a plane far below that
cf herself.

.There has been'nothlne In' the 'conduct of

facts to the end . that the party in power may
be handicapped and finally repudiated by the
people. It is my opinion, the alleged combine
to defeat Theodore Roosevelt for a second nom
nisitiun emanated^ from that source. The Dem
ocracy appears % be without a national j issue
and the leaders of that Darty are groping in
the dark in the hope that they will find that
which they are seeking.

A New Catarrh Cup3 Secures
National Popularity in Less
Than One Year.
Throughout a ' great nation of eighty million
it is a desperate struggle to secure even a rec-
ognition for a new article, to Bay nothing of
achieving popular favor, and yet within one
year Stuart's Catarrh Tablet?, the new catarrh
cure, has met 'with such success that to-day it
can be found in every dnjf; storo throughout
the United States and Canada. '
To be sure a large amount ul advertising vraa
necessary In the first instance to bring the rem-
*dy to the attention of the public, but everyone
familiar with the subject knows that advertis-
ing alone never made any article permanently
successful. It must have in addition absolute,
undeniable merit, and this the new catarrh cure
certainly possesses in a marked degree.
Physicians, who formerly depended upon In-
halers, sprays j and local washes or ointments,
now use Stuart's ; Catarrh Tablets because, as
one of the most prominent stated, these tablet:;
contain .In 'pleasant, convenient form: all the
really efficient . catarrh \ remedies, such as red
gum, blood root and similar antiseptics.
They contain no cocaine nor opiate, and are
given to little children with entire safety -ami
benefit. > ,.- -
Dr. J. J. Reitiger of Covington, Ky., says: "I
suffered from catarrh in my head and throa:
every fall/with stoppage of the nose and Irrita-
tion in the throat affecting my voice and often
extending; to the stomach, causing catarrh of
tho stomach. I bought a fifty cent package of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at my druggist's, car-
ried them In my pocket and used them faithful-
ly and the way in which they cleared my head
and throat was certainly remarkable. . I had n.>
catarrh last winter and spring and consider my-
self entirely free from any catarrhal trouble."
Mrs. Jerome Ellison of Wheeling, \V. . Va.'.
writes': "I suffered from catarrh nearly my'
whble life and last winter my two children also;
suffered from catarrhal colds and sore throat so
much they were out of school a largo portion o'
the winter. My brother, who was cured of en-
tarrhal deafness by using Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets urged me to try them so much that 1 did
so and am truly thankful, for what they ha vo
done for myself and my, children. I always
keep a box of the tablets In the house and at
the first appearance of a cold or sore throat wtr
nip It in the bud and catarrh is no. longer a
household affliction with us." Â¦ - . . .
Full sized packages of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets are sold for fifty cents at all druggists.

Burrage, the purchaser, is one of the
most widely known mine operators in
America. He was the organizer of the
Consolidated Copper Association. '. His for
tune is estimated ; at from $30,000,000 to
$40,000,000. Burrage has announced that he
will at once . begin development work on
the mines, hia first purpose being. to com
plete the b!g- channel that will drain the
workings of the entire 3500 acres. Â¦
The sale is of 3500 acres of placer ground,
comprising a large number of claims, the
principal ; ones of which are the Gray
Eagle, North Star, Mountain, Spring
Garden, Natchez, v Wolverine. Owl Creek,
Union and Rough* and Ready. They are
situated on a narrow peninsula formed by
the Middle and North forks of the Amer
ican River, taking in the first seven
miles of the divide and reaching within
two miles of the town of Forest Hill.
Many of the location!} were made in the
early days of mining in Placer County,
and have been steady producers of sold
ever since. To ,work the properties more
economically not long ago a consolidation
of the several holdings was made. â¢

Mining Company on the Forest Hill Di

were bought outright from the company,
the price paid being $2,500,000.

It is evident that the man behind the
gun did not shoot to - kill, because the
weapon was not loaded with either shot
or bullets. The motive could hardly have
been robbery, as there no demand or
even a challenge. 'it was altogether too
Berious-to be considered as a Joke.
Believing that he was seriously wound
ed, Kinkle went to the residence of his
brother, which Â¦was near at hand, and
roused him. ! . An examination disclosed
the fact that his wounds are only super
ficial, and that the gun was loaded with
powder only, which â¢ was confined with
black leather wads. One of these wads
was picked up this morning Â¦ near the
scene of the shooting.
WOODLAND, March 30.â Residents in
the northwestern" district of Woodland
were startled a short time before last
midnight by two shots fired in rapid suc
cession, followed by. the cry of a man ior
help. Many of them rushed out of their
houses, but as the cry was not repeated
they concluded that it was the prank of
some mischievous boys and made no
further investigation. *
This morning Levi Kinkle reported that
the shooting occurred on his premises.
He was out rather late last night and did
not return to his home until a few min
utes before 11 o'clock. He entered the
front gate and passed around to the rear
of the house with the intention of enter
ing by the rear door. Back of the house
there stands a large cottonwood tree.
When within a few feet -of this tree a
man stepped out and without challenge
or a word of warning fired one barrel
of a shotgun at Kinkle. This was quickly
followed by the discharge of the second
barrel. Kinkle shouted for help, and his
assailant turned and ran. X Â¦ :

The bringing out of "papas" and
"mammas" and others who would "do up
Sydney Vincent" were the threats, and
not until a special policeman ordered the
youths away from the premises was quiet
restored.
The choristers uttered loud cries and
as Sydney made his way back to the
church to enter a complaint with Sabin,
they followed and within the sacred. walls
there was a wordy argument between the
combatants, the boys showing a reck
lessness in speech and manners that ap
palled every one present.
The good folks of the , avenue were
brought to their doors by the shouts and
yells of. the fleeing boys and when Sydney
caught up to them â¢ the excitement in
creased, for without fear for after conse
quences he sent his assailants down, one
after the other and the folks who wit
nessed it were free to admit that the
stinging strokes of the stick which were
made upon the backs of the boys were
richly merited. .
Sydney did not see the joke in the same
light the youths did and. as the cnoris
tei-s took to their heejs he followed and
th Â¦. race added much zest to the proceed
ings.
It was with Innocent delight and play
fulness that they took to shying the
aforesaid rocks at the head of their moni
tor. The eggs were badly aimed and
fortunately tailed to have the desired ef
fect. Â¦
This being egg season may account for
the decision. Anyhow, Sydney had heard
of the deep-laia egg plot and so had Or
ganist Sabm. Ana others of the choir,
apart from the youths, were made aware
that trouble was brewing. Sydney Vin
cent is brave and of goodly I proportion
and athletic, however, and with , all those
physical advantages to -. accompany him
after choir practice he sauntered out on
the exclusive avenue. But while in the
act of warbling a vocal -scale his notes
were suddenly hushed by the intrusion of
sundry rocks which the dear little choir
boys, the pride and hope of fond and in
dulgent parents, had annexed from , an
unsightly pile of cobblestones which rep
resents the Board of Works on Van Ness
avenue.
Van Ness avenue was the battlefield
last night whereon a corps of choir boys
of St. Luke's Church marched in solid
body upon their elected enemy,' Sydney
Vincent, who has for a short while been
acting in the capacity of monitor. Sydney
has found it necessary from time to time
to impose fines in cases where he deemed
salutary punishment advisable. The choir
boys have, consequently, come to the
conclusion that he is somewhat of a too
strict disciplinarian and their, anger
broke loose some days ago, at which time
they entered into an agreement to pur
chase eggs that time had made stale
with which to besmear Sydney's Ea3ter
clothes.

considerable force and a heavy vote .was
polled. The friends of the nine candi

the candidates for the other offices felt
lonely. W. 5V. McNear, the attorney, was
elected vice president and Attorney Wil

H. C. Wilber was elected financial secre

The candidates for directors Included
the following:
Barney D. Murphy, one of the leading

Six and a Half Miles Above Earth.
Messrs. Berson and Suehring. the fam
ous meteorological aeronauts of the Ber
lin Observatory, accomplished a magnl
cent ballooning feat recently by attaining
an altitude of 33,800 feetâ almost six and
a half miles. This is the greatest height
recorded by the Instruments carried by
the aeronauts, but It Is probable that they
ascended to a greater altitude. The maxi
mum height they attained, however is
unknown, since both the observers fainted
owing to the rarefied atmosphere.
This Is not the highest altitude that haa
been attained by an aeronaut. In Septem
ber, 1S62, Messrs. Glalsher and Coxwell
ascended from Wolverhampton, England
to a height of 36.000 or 37,000 feet. The ex
act altitude was not recorded, since tho
two men were overcome by the intense
cold and the rarefaction of the atmos
phere. Mr GUUsher fainted and Mr.
Coxwell only Just succeeded In opening
the valve by pulling the valve rope o*
the balloon with his teeth to enabte tha

LONDON, March 29.â Abstaining from
eating 1 meat during Lent is quite going
out of fashion ln London. This is apparent
ly due more to the high price of fish than
to a decline in religious feeling. There
have never been so many special religious
services and they have never been so
largely attended and : never was there a
Lent or a holy week in which the butchers
were busier. Owing to the stormy weather
which prevailed during the month of.
March the fishermen were unable to send
full supplies of fish, hence the scarcity
and high prices of the usual Lenten food.
Apart from trade reasons,' society's at
titude has probably something to do with
London's consumption of food, for the res-,
taurants were nightly crowded throughr
out Lent with non-abstaining notables,
while the* number of social dinners enor
mously exceeded those of the former,
regime.
Only as regards marriages has London's
old-time observance of Lent -remained.'
None of any importance has occurred.
The royal: family did not join in the gay
'ety this week, but King Kdward was the
puest at a dinner given during the week
By Major General Fisher- Paget and Mrs.
Paget. Another American woman, Mra.
Adair, gave a cotillon March 25, which
was one of the most brilliant events of
the London season. ,
Queen 'Alexandra, who is at present at
Copenhagen and-. whÂ« â¢ until lately'-never

coming an expert that she paid a tutor to
teach her and ; acquired such proficiency
that her playing at Lord Farquhar's royal

BERLIN, March* 29.â Andrew D. White,
United States Embassador to' Germany,
*has not resigned and is "quite undecided
as to whether he will do so at some fu
ture time or serve out his term. His
health, though not robust, is better than
it has been for several. years. He never
misses his office hours and has been un
commonly active in a social way. The
Em6assador is now on the Riviera, sim
ply on regular leave of absence.
President Roosevelt, after assuming the
Chief Magistracy, asked White, as he did
the other American Embassadors ana
other Ministers, if he would remain dur
ing his term, and Mr. White gave him
his general assurance that he would. This
assurance, however, is not regarded as a
bar to the Embassador's offering his
resignation at any time. White, after his
active life, is rather weary of the Em
bassadorship. â¢ ' Â¦
Germany's dispute with Venezuela is
not yet wholly closed, although broad
bases of settlement have been agreed
upon. The German squadron at La
Guayra has been dispersed, thus with
drawing the implied threats against Ven
ezuela. Germany wishes to allow Presi
dent. Castro ample time to yield to the
conditions laid | down in January last,
which have been, modified in accordance
Â¦ with President Castro's demand. '
It is apparent that the Boers' experience
with modern rifles will have a permanent
Influence upon German military tactics.
Emperor William and high military au
thorities have been closely studying all
authentic accounts of Boer battles, which
describe whole companies rising and rush
ing forward to new firing positions, as
had "hitherto been customary. The Em
peror has instituted the practice of only
eight or ten men rising at once and ad
vancing and has decided also that all
topographical features 'of the field must
be fully utilized for the protection of the
attackers. .
As Illustrating tho importance- which
the authorities here attach to the military
lessons of the Boer war, it may be men
tioned that returning officers In all cases
get appointments to the general staff.

OF DIPLOMACY
John Martin, an aged miner of Tonopah,
Nev., has .lately .gained a fund .of valua
ble metropolitan experiences which a life
time residence in the frontier mining
camps denied him. Incidentally he lost a
lot of specimens of gold quartz, the value
of which he estimates at $2000. Â¦
It was not until Mr. Martin had emerged
into the sere and yellow leaf that fortune
made it possible for him to suffer so great
a loss, but she was prodigal with her
gifts when she did relent. The aged
miner was one of the lucky leaseholders
in Tonopah who took out fortunes from
the fabulously rich mines Jast year. Aside
from holding a lease on ground belong
ing to the Tonopah Mining Company, he
located some ground of his own, and after
the expiration of his lease he did some
development on his individual claims.
Fortune was still with him. and he un
covered a stringer of amazingly rich gold
ore. Then he concluded to take a vaca
tion, and selecting some especially choice
specimens from . his new discovery he
came to San Francisco.
Naturally he drifted into the company
of mining men in this city, and his speci
mens were freely shown and commented
upon. To him one day came a man who
took the keenest interest In the new find
Such glorious fragments of a rich vein
awoke unbounded admiration in him.
What figure did the lucky owner place
on the claims? Martin had wearied of Ufa
in mining camps, and he thought it would
be nice for him to part with his holdings
at a good round figure and live in the
whirl of metroplitan life.
Could the promoter sell these claims?
Why. there was nothing to It. He had
bunked with Johnny Mackay in the old
days before the Comstock and he and
Tom Lane had gone to school together in
Missouri. When he showed them those
specimens they would get writer's cramy
making out checks for the purchase pric-
Martin turned over the specimens to
the promoter, and calmly waited in an
ticipation of his bank roll increasing to
euch dimensions that a hound could not
Jump over it. But day gave way to day
without the consummation of the deal be
ing announced, and the old man became
uneasy. He took counsel with a friend
who was younger and wiser than he, and
was told that he had probably been bun
koed. Together they repaired to Captain
Seymour's office Friday and told him
the story. Detective Harry Reynolds was
detailed on the case, and succeeded in lo
cating the promoter, but even the com
manaing prfesence and the harsh bass
voice of the authorized sleuth failed to im
press the promoter to the extent of re
turning the specimens.
He claimed he was in lawful possession
of them/ and defied the officer to molest
him. Reynolds could do no more, so he
advised the confiding miner to swear out
a warrant against the promoter for felony
embezzlement, and let it go at- that.
Martin intends to have the promoter ar
rested, and will swear to a complaint to
morrow morning ln the Polcie Court.

ALONG THE COAST
LONDON, March 29.â Miss Ellen M
Stone, the American missionary, 'arrived
in London to-day. She said to. a corre
spondent:
/ "I am very tired, but lam glad to be
here. I cannot reiterate too ; often my
thanks to my. American friends; on the
other side. I shall be delighted to get
home once more.: I cannot say any more
than Is known about the causes for the
kidnaping. The idea that Tsilka had any
thing to do with it is just as absurd and
cruel as when some people hinted I had
connived at my own abduction.
"Macedonia is a very troubled state. It
Is seething. What *is going to- happen I
do not know. The Government must set
tle who must make amends for our. cap
ture. Throughout my captivity I felt the
hand of God guiding and protecting me.
Why my people are so anxious to see ras
and hear what I have to say puzzles me.
If I had done something myself I could
understand; but I was only an unwilling
agent in the incident, which, I hope and
pray, will eventually benefit the work of
the gospel in Bulgaria and Turkey." i i
Miss Stone Is staying at a friend s
house, where she has so far successfully
evaded an army of reporters who have
been scouring Liondon in search of her.
While she talked Miss Stone constantly
played with â¢ her " umbrella and Â¦ started
nervously at any noise. The lines in her
face show the anxiety she has gons
through. Ray Stannard Baker, who
brought Miss Stone from Salonica to Lon
don, said: .
"The interest Miss Stone created was
extraordinary. All through Turkey and
Servia the crowds waiting at the stations
passed around the car in the hope of see
ing Miss Stone. Some of those who knew
her came in, talked-'with her and bade
her farewell. .Until we got to Servia the
most stringent precautions were taken by
the officials to prevent a repetition of the
kidnaping. One of the most interesting
parting scenes was the baptism of the
Tsilka baby ' last Sunday. The ceremony
occurred in Mr. House's little Bulgarian
chapel at Salonica. Miss Stone became
godmother, and the bady was named the
Bulgarian equivalent for Ellen.
"It will be a long 1 time before Miss
Stone recovers from the effects of her
captivity. She scarcely slept until she
reached Ostend yesterday evening, and is
still very nervous and slightly lame, a3
the result of the fall, from her horse while
she was* in the hands of the brigands.
Since her release Miss Stone's time has
been greatly taken up with letters from
all parts of the world evincing the sym
pathy and interest, which her Â¦ capture
created. During nearly, all the journey
from Salonica* Miss Stone wrote assidu
ously ln an endeavor to answer these cor
respondents^ '
COPENHAGEN, March 29.â In an inter
view with a correspondent on the subject
of Congressman â¢ Richardson's resolution
for the appointment of a committee to in
vestigate charges made by Captain
Christmas in regard to the -sale of the
Danish West Indies, a high official Eaid:
Neither Christmas nor Gron was ever iiven
credentials as agent for the sale of the Danish
West Indies. Christmas has been forced to
declare 'that his report of bribery was false.
These men never negotiated with Washington,
and have tn no way influenced the negotia
tions. These were conducted through Laurits
S. Swenson. the United States Minister here,
and Constantln Brun, the Danish Minister at
Washington. The Danish Government is under
no obligation to private persons. Hence no
commission Is due or will be paid.
The alleged scandal 1e the result of a quar
rel between Christmas and Gron. The latter
claimed he effected the sale and that hence
he wanted a commission. Christmas made
a similar claim, accompanying lt by a con
fidential report to the Danish Oovernment con
taining: statements regarding bribery, etc., as
recently published ln Washington. Most of
the report was printed by the Danish press
some time ago. Gron, seeing it was hopeless
to expect a commission, started for Wash
ington with ChrlBtroas' report ln his pocket,
boasting to the anti-sale advocates here that
he would be revenged by Influencing Congress
to decline to pass the appropriation for the
purchase of the Islands.
Before the commencement of the negotia
tions Christmas and Gron actually tried to be
come connected with the matter as agents.
The then Premier. Dr. Hoering. gave them
eorne encouragement and private, persons fa
voring the sale furnished small amounts for
their traveling expenses. Dr. Hoerlng was
indiscreet. He discussed a commission, but
bribery was not suggested. He and the other
parties epeedily discovered that they had been
imposed upon and broke off their connection
with Christmas and Gron, considering them to
be without influence.
WASHINGTON, March 29 âThe special
committee appointed by Speaker Hender
son to investigate allegations In connec
tion with the Danish West Indies pur
chase held an executive meeting to-day
and determined to begin the investigation
next Tuesday morning. The committee
unanimously decided that the hearings
would be open to the public. Chairman
Dalzell was authorized to make any ar
rangements necessary to secure the pres
ence of witnesses. It was understood,
however, that several parties would ap
pear voluntarily without being sum
moned.
As the charges showed that they had
been brought to Representative Richard
son's attention by Niels Gron, it was con
sidered desirable that the latter should
appear, and he probably will be heard on
Tuesday.

Of Physical Manhood.
No form of athletic exercise demands such
perfect physical condition as prize ( fighting.
Every muecle In the body must be fully devel-
1 oped and suocle, and' the heart, lunes and
stomach must ant to perfection.
Whether we Indorse prizefighting or Â¦ not. lt
1b nevertheless interesting- Â¦ to know the manner
by which men arrive at such physical perfec-
tion.
.Tames Jeffries, . the present champion heavy-
weight cf the world, and his gallant opponent,
Tom Sharkey, in the greatest pugilistic en-
counter- that has ever taken place, both pur-
sued much the same course of training:, \ and !
the first and most important part of this train-
ing was to eet the stomach ln condition and to
keep- the diceatlcn . absolutely perfect/ ko that
every muscle and nerve would be at Its high-
est capabilities. 'Â¦.*. .
This was not done by a secret patent medi-
cine, but both of these ercat pugilists used a
well-known natural "digestive tablet sold by
druggiFls under name of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets and composed of the digestive fer-
ments " which every stomach requires Â¦ for
healthy dlcestlon.
Champion Jeffries saya: "Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets prevent acidity, strengthen tho stomach
and inaure perfect digestion. They keep a man
ln fine physical condition." SlKned, James J.

The gallant lighter, Sharkey, says: "Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets remove all discomfort ' after
eating. They rest the (stomach and reatore it
to a healthful condition. I heartily recommend
them." Blgned, Â¦ Thos. J. Sharkey.
The advantage of the dally use of Stuart's
Dynpcpnla Tablets Is that they keep people
â¢well and ward off ' sickness and are equally
valuable to well persons as to the dyspeptics
Another advantage. Is that these tablets con-'

Just before the steamship Alameda sailed on
her previous voyage to Honolulu the members
of the crew presented a token of remembrance
to J. A. Poppen, who, after fifteen years of
service as porter on the steamship, resigned to
accept a position ashore. A meerschaum pipe
and case and a meerschaum cigar holder, suit
ably Inscribed, were the tokens given by the
Alameda's crew to their former shipmate. Fif
teen years as porter on one ship Is a record of
falthtul service. Poppen, who is well on in
years, is greatly missed by the officers cf the
AJameda, who were all fond of the old man
and had grown to look upon him as something
that went with the ship.

George S. McComb made a formal de
mand yesterday on Powel Fredrick to
surrender the office of Justices' Clerk to
which McComb claims to have been le
gally appointed. McComb made his de
mand in the form of a written communi
cation, in which he requests Fredrick to
desist from performing the duties of Jus
tices' Clerk and that he surrender and
deliver to McComb all books and records
of the Justices' Clerk's office.
Fredrick read the document, but In
formed McComb that he would pay no
attention to the demand. McComb with
drew from the scene without stating what
his future intentions are. McComb bases
his action on the fact that his official
bond was approved by Superior Judge
Cook. Mayor Schmitz will veto the reso
lution of the Supervisors confirming Mc-
Comb's appointment and on that score
will not approve the band. Fredrick says
that he will refuse to surrender the office
even should fourteen Supervisors over
ride the Mayor's veto.

afternoon In the Recorder's office.

James M. Wilkins, who was defeated for
the office of Supervisor at the last elec
tion, made an effort - yesterday to have
himself declared elected a member of the
board. He bases his claim, on the fact
that the recently terminated contest
shows that he has a larger number of
votes than any of the contestants. " His
attorney, T. D. Riordan. .made a motion
before Judge Murasky; yesterday to have
Wilkins entered in the contest as an in
tervenor and declared elected Supervisor.
Riorrtan supported the motion by showing
that the official count of the votes cast
last November gives Wilkins 15,689 votes,
as against- the 15,219 the recount gives
Horace Wilson. The other contestants
each have fewer votes than Wilson.
'â¢* The question â¢ will be. argued before
Judge Murasky Tuesday. :
.The labor candidates each gained a vote
yesterday by the admission of a ballot
cast In the Thirteenth precinct of thÂ©
Thirty-fifth Assembly District, which was
"objected to on the ground that it shouia
not be counted because the words 'eighty

Judge Murasky held that the words were
not a distinguishing â¢ mark, and ordered
the ballot counted.

j Fund Is Started.
Some time ago the Gael, a weekly paper
published in New York, started a fund for
the purpose of restoring the Gaelic lan
guage. Several thousand dollars were
raised. The last St. Patrick's day con
vention gave one-quarter of the net pro
ceeds of the two entertainments given
under its auspices to this fund, and some
thing over $300 was raised. Now the
priests of the city propose to increase this
amount, and while it is said that in this
way the amount will be doubled, it Is not
proposed to stop at any figure.
In order to show appreciation of Father
O'Growney's work it is intended to hold
funeral services over his remains in every
principal city from California to New
York. A guard of honor, consisting of at"
least one priest each "from the archdio
ceses of San Francisco, Monterey, Los
Angeles and Sacramento, will uccompany
the body. These priests will be selected
from those who were most intimately ac
quainted and associated with Father
O'Growney in his lifetime.
All the Irish societies of Chicago have
already made preparations for the proper
reception" of the body. A delegation from
each society will meet the escort and the
body at 'the depot and accompany; It to

II fl , League have resulted in the rais-
| ing of a fund that will permit
the returning to the land of his
birth of the remains \of â¢ Rev. Eugene
O'Growney, to whose. love, of the litera
ture of his native land is due the Intense
interest manifested at -present in the his-,
tory and the language* ur\ the Gael.
Father O'Growney was practically the
pioneer in the movement to restore the
Gaelic language as the language of Ire
land, and to his earnest and energetic
work is due the interest that is being
taken in the movement..- â¢
The story of Father O'Growney's labors
in this cause is pathetic. His work ended
when he was taken sick in this city. De
votion to what he considered his life
work, the exactions of constant study,
and too much burning of the midnight oil
weakened his constitution. For a time he
was attached to several parishes in the
city, but* was finally i compelled to aban
don' his charges.
,Los Angeles became his home for a
time. Then ' he was forced to go into the
high altitudes of Arizona, The dread con-,
sumption, which he long fought against,
Anally claimed him for a victim. Now
his remains are to be transported to Ire
land. â¢
He charges Mrs. Gutmann with secret
ing her husband's wealth for the purpose
of defrauding her creditors. In the affi
davit accompanying his petition. Clary
avers that Mrs. Gutmann. in appraising
the estate, valued it at $260, and deliber
ately concealed all knowledge she had
of $150,000 she received for certain mining
stock, several promissory notes worth
$3000 and certain valuable pieces of real
property.
Matilda Gutmann of L Stockton, widow
of David Gutmann, and administratrix of
his estate, has been cited to appear before
Judge Troutt, April 4, and show the con
dition of the estate of the deceased. The
citation was issued upon the petition of
W. H. Clary, who claims to have a claim
of $30,000 against the property.

In 1894 Father O'Growney was compelled
to leave Ireland on account of his falling
health, and after a short sojourn in this
city, where his kindly manners endeared
him to all, he went to Arizona, but the
dread consumption did not yield to treat
ment.
Father O'Growney was born at Bally
fallan, Athlone, County Meath, In 1863.
He died October 18, 1899, at the Sisters'
Hospital, Los ' Angeles, . at the age of 37
years. He was educated in" St. Finan'a
Seminary at Navan. Later he attended
Maynorth College, where he completed
his studies of Irish history and the Irish
language. After being Â¦ ordained a priest
he was engaged for some time as a
teacher in the college and at the same
time edited the Gaelic Journal of. Dublin.
.Soon he began the compilation of an
Irish text book on the phonetic plan,
which at once proved a success, and sev
eral large editions were. published. The
book is now used by every teacher of the
Gaelic language in the world.

When Ireland is, reached, the demon

will be reinforced along the route by
many delegations from the Gaelic League,
and will probably number several hundred
persons by the time Dublin is reached.
There there will be an immense proces

S tre et 'Railway Men Urge
Him to Settle the
Trouble.
Schmitz Summons and Rep
rimands a Private De
tective.
The committee appointed by the Street
Railway Men's Union, headed by Richard
Cornelius, business agent and president of
the union, waited on the Mayor yesterday
to urge his co"-operation in bringing about
amicable relations between the street
railway companies and* their employes.
Cornelius was accompanied by Ed Rosen
berg and Walter Goff, and the committee
was closeted with the Mayor for some
time. . . : '
After the question had been discussed in
all its phases the committee urged the
Mayor to use his best endeavors to induce
the railway companies to * refrain from
discharging men who happen to belong or
who may join the union, which has, been
organized for self-protection. The Mayor
agreea to do all -in his power to bring
about the desired result, and to that ena
will arrange, a- conference with the repre
sentatives of the Eastern syndicate wnicn
has purchased the local systems. ihla
conference, however, will not take place
until the transfer of the properties has
been fully accomplished. Mayor Schmitz
stated that he believed that the new own
ers were inclined to deai fairly .with the
men in> their employ and that the unpopu
lar policy pursued by General Manager
Vining. would be discontinued. .
Reprimanding a Spotter.
When the committee left the' Mayor's
office one of the members . returned and
informed his Honor that a spotter was
loitering in the corridor, with the evident
intention,' of watching the movements of
some member of the committee; The
Mayor became indignant and directed his
secretary, : George- Keane, : to bring the
man before' him. Keane immediately ac
costed the spotter and informed him that
the Mayor wished to see him. The spot
ter was disinclined to comply with the
order, but Keane told him it would be

The spotter was accordingly ushered into
the presence of the Mayor.
"What is your name and what is your
business?'.', questioned the Mayor.
"Do I have Â¦ to answer that question?"
asked the spotter. .
On being informed that he had better
answer the spotter replied:
Employed to Watch Cornelius.
"I am a detective in the employ of
Pinkcrton's Agency, and I have been in
structed to watch the movements of Mr.
Cornelius, the business, agent of the
Street Railway Men's Union. I have been
shadowing him for the past three days.
My name is William Leet."
Leet declined to give his house address
or any further information about himself
other than what he had already told.
"Now, I want to tell you, Mr. Leet,"
said the Mayor sternly, "that I will not
tolerate any surveillance of people who
enter my office. I will see to it that no
man shall be permitted to loiter around
the corridors of the City Hall to watch
any of my visitors. If you are caught at
this again I will certainly have you put
in Jail for vagrancy."
With this Â¦ parting injunction Leet re
tired from the Mayor's presence in a
crestfallen manner. The Mayor then di
rected Usher Blum to keep an eye out for
spotters and to report their presence to
him at once.

Share of Big Estate
Awaits a Redding
Woman.
Judge Alfred J. Fritz had an adventure
last evening that he will not forget In a
lifetime. He had the courage, to capture
a bold purse-snatcher, but dropped him
as he would a hot potato when the thief
leveled a glittering rex-olver at his body.
The robber was In contempt of court.
End if a bench warrant will effect
his capture Judge Fritz . will cheerfully
allow the city and county to pay the
fellow's board and lodging for an indefn-
Ite period.
His Honor was on his way to attend
a smoker given by the Montlcello Club.
He boarded a Haight-street car. and,
while talking to E. K. Jones of 221 Fred
erick street, was planning a speech that
would add to his plurality at the next
flection. His thoughts were rudely
chocked when the car was opposite the
Emporium. He noticed a middle-aged
woman rushing toward the back plat
form Â¦with the evident Intention of jump
ing from the moving car. Judge Fritz
jumped up and grabbed the lady before
t-he could effect her purpose. The lady
wildly cried, "That man snatched my
purse !" She pointed to a small man w*io
had left the car a half -minute before and
was making tracks toward Powell street.
The Judge valiantly said, "Stay here,
madam. I'll capture the miscreant," and
never has the training he has gained in
the gymnasium of the Olympic Club been
in better stead. His Honor sprinted the
lirst fifty yards in record time and was
eoon on top of the thief. The latter, how
ever, dodged through tfie crowd and
moved in a snake-like fashion up Powell
Btreet. His Honor redoubled his speed
and caught nis man in front of Green
Bros, cafe, near Ellis street.
"I want you." shouted the Judge.
"Why?" said the thief as coolly as an
honest man. He looked his Honor
straight in the eye and never quailed.
"You have stolen a purse," answered
his Honor, "and you are under arrest."
"Give him thirty days. Judge!", yelled
a bystander, who recognized Judge Fritz.
'He'll give me nothing," replied the
prisoner. "But I'll give you this if you
don't let go of me." . 0
The thief pressed a revolver against
the third button of Judge Fritz' vest and
the latter was persuaded to let go of the
thief. The thief did not stand on the or
der of his going, but went. Again the
Judge gave chase, but this time at a re-
Fpectable distance. He was joined by
I'oiicemaji Briggs and they followed the
robber. He darted into the Eins-street
entrance of the Baldwin Annex with
Briggs after him. Judge Fritz tried to
head the man off by going around to the
Market-street side, but when he arrived
the thief was gone.
The Court and policeman compared
notes and described the thief as a Nttle
man wearing dark clothes and a soft
urewn hat. The Judge was unable to find
the lady who lost her purse.
The chase played havoc with Judge
Fritz* nerves, and the speech he intended
delivering to the members of the Monti
cello Club was lost to him and to them.
He says he has a vivid recollection of
the thief's appearance, and promise* no
end of suffering for the fellow if he ever
appears in his dock.

CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY
Youthful Bride Takes
Poison During Her
Honeymoon.
Joseph von Lochner, a German noble
man, who was under arrest in 1S9S,
charged with the murder of Sadie Carpen
ter in the Hubbard House at Fourth and
Everett streets, committed suicide yester
day afternoon. He walked into a saloon
at 37 Third street and with a word to the
bartender swallowed a strong solution of
cyanide of potassium. Before medical aid
reached him he was dead.
Sadie Carpenter's death, the responsi
bility for which was attributed to Von
Lochner, created a tremendous sensation
and furnished an interesting study in
criminology. Her dead body was found
in bed, with a rag loosely knotted around
her throat. At hrst it was supposed to
be a case of strangulation, but the au
topsy showed that death was due to other
causes. Von Lochner occupied a room
next to the woman. His statement and
those of many of the witnesses proved
his depravity, which marked the case as
unusual in criminal annals, and the rec
ords were preserved by the detective de
partment to be given to the State Uni
versity for use in psychological studies.
Von Lochner waa a pensioner of the
German Government, and, it is said, was
at one time an officer in high standing in
the Prussian army. He had a number of
medals which were bestowed for gallantry
during his service in. the Franco-Prussian
war. He was extremely reticent regard
ing hi3 past and had no confidants. Be
sides his pension he gained some income
as retoucher of photographs.
He was a hard drinker and slovenly in
his personal habits. Captain Seymour
identified the body at the Morgue as that
of the suspect in the Carpenter case.
: The, fraudulent .methods used by Charles
C. Maxon and his. associates in, securing
deeds to real estate and valuable personal
property, in exchange for worthless junk
and bogus whisky certificates, as pub
lished exclusively in/rhe Call, has set the
police, to swork. Yesterday, evidence j was
secured by -the ; authorities and it is ex
pected that criminal proceedings will be
instituted against the gang of sharpers
by some of its victims. " '.. ,
/Investigation discloses the fact Â¦Â¦ that
Charles C. Maxon, his brother, ; . George
Maxon, and T. J. May and others , have
been operating in this city in disposing of
the bogus certificates. â¢ < .'Â¦;Â¦.'.}Â¦.'./â¢'/
The record of some of the mentis .very
unsavory and it has been'a matter of sur
prise that the gang should have dared to
operate in so bold a manner. 'Â¦ â¢". y J
T. J. May, who vigorously . denied on
Friday that he knew anything about the
"whisky certificates," has been one of the
leaders of the gang that tried to dispose
of the fake documents. \
Two prominent liquor dealers in this
city stated yesterday that May had tried
to induce them to purc'hase some of the
"certificates" within the last two months
and that May had a large number of the
worthless papers in his possession.
A dispatch received from Chicago yes
terday proves that Charles C. Maxon,
George Maxcn, T. J. May and other3
were engaged in a barefaced' swindle in
selling and trading "whisky certificates."
The information given in the. Chicago
dispatch is as follows:, ~ Â¦ .:
Prominent liquor dealers here state that they
have never heard of the existence of the United
States distillers Distributing Company. ; No
such firm is mentioned. in the directory..
Denounces One of the- Gang.
M. Rothenberg, president of M. Rothen
berg & Co., liquor, dealers on* Kearny
street, between Pine and California,
made the following statement. yesterday:
If T. J. May says that he never knew of tha
existence of these co-called "whisky certifi
cates" he is telling a falsehood. I know May
very well, for. he owes our firm a bill for sup
plies we sold him when he ran a little res
taurant in this city. JHe never paid us a cent
and I understand that his record in the East Is
shady. He came here : to see me about two
months ago. He. Introduced a man from Oak
land- whose,' name I cannot, remember.' May
said that â¢ the ...Oakland man.,was : wlllinsr to
trade some real estate for come ; pt the; "whlskv
certificates" and May ' wanted Â¦ irte to buy i the
whiaky from the man. May had a- big bunch
of the certificates with him. "I told May that
II. did not do business with irtesoonslble per
sons ar.d that our firm did not want to have
anytMnp to do with him. He said if I would
help to put his deal through with the- Oakland
party he would pay his account with our
firm.' I declined to -discuss the matter with
him and went Into my office, leaving May In
the store. He came in to see me again about
two weeks auo and wanted to discuss the
"whisky certificates," but I would have noth
ing to do with him. I am glad that The Call
has exj.-rsed this swindle and I think the gang
should be arrested and sent to prison.
S. Brownstone Approached.
S. Brownstone, president of the Brown
stone Wine Company, 331 : Ellisstreet; was
also approached by T. J. May, who offered
to sell him some of the "certificates."
Brownstone was seen yesterday and said:
A young ' man named Man-in, who resides
in the Mozart House, at 321 Ellis street, first
brought the. certificates to me. He subse
quently introduced May.' ' The certificates he
wished me to buy called for ten barrels of
the* whisky. I recognized at Â¦ once that the
whole thing was a fraud, but I led May along
to see to what extent his scheme would de
velop. He first offered the whisky at 40 cents
a eallon, but when he found I did not* seem
disposed to buy he lowered his price. I told
him that whisky that had been in storage
since 1895 would have evaporated to a con
siderable extent. He Immediately met this
assertion with an offer to allow, eight gallons
to the barrel for evaporation. He appeared
very anxious to dispose of the certificates.
May's certificates' were . about the crudest
affairs of the kind that I had ever seen, and
It is a great surprise to me how any one could
be duped by them.
Bond Dealer Is Swindled.
W. A. C. Smith, a bond dealer who has
offices at room 448 Parrott building and
resides at Sixteenth and Guerrero streets,
is a heavy loser by exchanging real estate
for some of the bogus whisky certificates.
Smith yesterday made the following
statement:
Duncan, the real estate man, whom I have
known for a number of years, came to me in
the first instance and offered to trade me a
certificate representing fifty barrels of whisky,
stored in Chicago, for my Sutter City property.
He told me that the certificate belonged to
E. O. Beamer, but that he was trying to trade
it in order to make a commission. The cer
tificate looked regular enough to â¢ nÂ»e Â¦ and "I
did not for a single moment auspect any fraud.
Duncan and Beamer both advised me to make
the deal find I did. Duncan was to have re
ceived a commission on the sale of the spirits.
I assisted in inducing Jean Golet. who lives
somewhere, on Broadway, to invest ' also.
He exchanged property, for a certificate. I do
not know exactly how much his property is
valued at, . but - it Is . probably worth three or
four thousand dollars. I di> not care to let
the people know how much of a fool I was,
but I even went so far as to pay the notary
for recording Golet's deed. And I was to have
received part of Golet's profit on the sale of
the whisky.
Â¦ I do not intend to let go my property,
which is worth about $3000. I Â¦ have already
seen Beamer and he has promised not to trans
fer my dcedJ I shall Institute proceedings as
aoon as my lawyer is disengaged.
E. 0. Beamer Explains.
Beamer, who 'owned the certificate that
was sold to Smith, claims that he did not
know the paper was a fraud and that th*
United States Distilling and Distributing
Company never had an existence. Beamer
paid that he owned eighty acres of land
at Riverside and some more property, in
San Bernardino : County. He said : "I
went to May about a month ago with. an
offer to soil my property. He introduced
mo to Maxon. Maxon produced the
whisky Â¦ certificates < and . offered to -ex
change . them : for my : land. Just about
this time Hamilton, the piano Â¦ dealer,
whom Maxon and May were trying to in
duce to invest in the spirits, ;wjred to
Chicago regarding Â¦ the . whisky. , He re
ceived a reply that it was all right. It
was. this reply, that led me. to part with
my. property â¢ without further in
vestigation.
i "I did . not see Smith ; until -the proposi
tion , was almost concluded. '. Duncan , car
ried on all negotiations with him:" " '

started in the race, but the pace proved
too fast.
Cadogan, the sprinter, did not enter the
races, as Trainer Christie refused to risk
a strained leg which has been bothering
him lately. Abadie won the 100-yard dash
in the absence of Cadogan, with Brown
and Townsend close seconds. Â¦
The 440-yard dash was. the best con
tested of all the events. The bunch of
runners kept together around the lap and
at the finish spread out across the track
and struggled down the last hundred
yards but a stride's distance apart. How
ard had been leading and Ligda looked
good for second up to the 25-yard line.
Hartley, Kuster or Adler might have been
picked- for third, but the last few yards
changed everything. Adler squeezed In
between Howard and Ligda, who were
weakening, and broke the tape a foot, in
front of Kuster, who beat out Ligda and
Howard at the last moment. Howard was
third.
Cheek won both hurdle . races'-., and
showed vast improvement over his last
year's form, when Powell was the victor.
He glided over the hurdles with rase,
Powell was running but half a step behind
him in the high hurdles when he tripped
on one of the sticks and fell, letting Han

Stanford Nine Defeats aItmtitH-
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 29.â
The varsity baseball team defeated the
alumni nine this afternoon in a close and
interesting game by the score of 3 to 2.
The contest was largely a pitchers* battle.
Both Lanagan and Parker were in fine
form. The almost, errorless support given
the varsity pitcher was the most satisfac
tory feature of the game from the col
legian's point of view. Not a ball was
allowed to get through the infield that
was not a clean hit, and the outfielders
accepted every chance given them.
Spencer and "Weber and the battery
(Lanagan and Locomotive Smith) dis
played the best - form of the alumni
players. .- â¢- â¢-..

The fielding of both teams was good.
Hightmuller, Berkeley's left fielder,
carried off the honors of the day in this
particular. The summary:
The Olympians showed their lack of
practice, there being several good players
on the team. TVilkina pitched good ball
but was replaced in the sixth Inning by
Taezell. The latter , did not prove ef
fective.
The University of California baseball
team defeated the Olympic Club team

In an errorless game. The score was 12

J. Darling's imported greyhound Gam
bit won his first course in this country
cleverly yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. He led Fiery Friend four lengths
and then went on and killed the hare,
shutting but his opponent pointless. In
his first course to-day he will meet Vulcan
and will be more thoroughly tested than
he was yesterday. He is not a strongly
put together dog, being considered defi
cient in driving power Tn the hind quar
ters by competent judges of greyhounds.
Of the four stakes on the card the reserve
stake was the only one completed. Th'.s
was won by W. N. Hoag's Cecil M, which
defeated Toronto in the deciding course.
In the special stake, which will be run
in its entirety to-day, A. J. Martin is con
sidered best at the top of the card, while
Sacramento Boy is expected to hold his
own at the bottom of the list. Three to
one is chalked up against the former in
the long odds book, while 4 to 1 can be
lmd against the latter. Sacramento Boy
will meet a number of fast ones in Van
dal, Anchor and Merrirnac before he
reaches the deciding course.
Tralee Boy and.Anciior are quoted at
6 to 1, War Eagle and Vandal 7, Merrimac
and Lost Chord S, Cold Shivers, Homer

In the open stake Harlean Gladys is

National League Baseball Fight.
NEW YORK, March 29.â Justice Truax
In the Supreme Court to-day handed down
a decision in the National League base
ball fight overruling a demurrer made by
the Spalding interests against proceedings
begun by Freeman. The decision gives
Spalding leave to withdraw the demurrer
and to enter an answer to the complaint
on payment of costs.
James E. Britt Jr. has decided to stake
his reputation as a boxer on one big fight.
He has selected as his opponent Frank
Erne, the lightweight champion of the
world.
Erne made the advances for the match
some weeks since and a telegram of ac
ceptance was forwarded to him yesterday
at Buffalo. . .- , ' â¢-,.."
If he accepts the terms . offered the ,bout
will be promoted. by. the Â¥osemlte~ Club
In the latter part of May, the men weigh
ing 133. pounds at the ringside. An answer
is expected to-day. Erne went out of his
class and was defeated by,McQovern and
2>y Rube Ferns. In neither of theseidld
ho lose the lightweight championship.
. Britt with his manager and with Spider
Kelly, his second, went over the situation
thoroughly yesterday. The agreement to
fight Erne was the result. -
. Erne fought- in Chicago a week ago
and at the time it was reported he had
injured two of his ribs. As he has made
a match since .then with Joe Gans, 1t 23
hardly likely he was badly injured. Here
is what Lou Houseman of the Chicago
Inter Ocean says of his performance with
Gus Gardner: . , . . . V
"Erne's showing against Gardner gave
evidence that he nas not retrograded. He
is as fast as ever with both. hands, and
the snap and vim of his punches spoke
volumes for the hitting powers of the man
who delivered them. His left-hand Jabs
go straight to the mark with telling ac
curacy and force, and the bewildering
rapidity with which he shifts his attack
from face to body, and vice versa, is a
thing to be remembered." 'Â¦>r/),.w

' Henry P. Dalton resents the imputation
in the supplemented complaint of D. Ed
ward Collins that he has been negotiating
blank orders with J. B. Lanktree bo that
ho could get money on county printing ln
advance and xnako thÂ© Oakland Enquirer
Publishing Company suffer, to the ulti
mate injury ot Mr. Collins. Replying In
a demurrer to the complaint, E'ulton has
this to say:
"The plaintiff does .not show how he
can appeal to a court of equity for a de
cree and at the same time Insert ln his
complaint a statement of alleged fact*,
which are utterly and entirely Impropor
and have no standing therein and allege
no damage to the plaintiff or the corpora
tion, and appear to have been inserted for
the purpose of venting the venom and
spite of some one connected with the case,
or' of some one who is dictating the policy
of the prosecution."
The demurrer finds fault with nearly
every paragraph ln the complaint, though
the alleged ambiguities are the same aa
those pointed out In the demurrer to the
original complaintâ that which expresses
disbelief in the statements of Dr. George
C. Pardee at his depositionâ the demurrer
says it is not clear on what the plaintiff
ba'ses his disbelief.
Attorneys Ash and Richardson, for Mr.
Collins, gave notice to-day that they will
take the deposition of G. B. Daniels, man
ager of the Enquirer, before Judge Greene
next' Saturday. ' )j ,'Â»..-Â¦

LIFE IS EBBING
IN PRISON CELL
George Jones Passes His
Ninety-Third Mile
stone in Jail.
Murderer of Lorenzo Dutil
Still Awaits a Second
Trial for Crime.
Oakland Office) San Francisco Call.
1113 Broadway, March 29.
George Jones, for seventeen years con
fined ln the Alameda County Jail, has
just celebrated his . ninety-third birth
day.
For fourteen years he had been a bed
ridden occupant of a cell at the jail,
where he was taken almost a score of
years ago to be held for trial on a charge
of having murdered Lorenzo Dutll, a San
Pablo avenue saloon-keeper.
Jones -was tried and convicted of the
crime, but was granted a new trial by tha
Supreme Court. During tha delay tha
prisoner, then 76 years of age, was
stricken with paralysis, which left him a
helpless and hopeless invalid. Â¦ He waa
put Into a cot ln his- cell, and from that
day has only left It when, taken to bis
bath.
The aged prisoner has become Imbecile,
and he will probably* never leave his cell
again, except to be taken to tho burying
ground. He has been slowly fading
away, but the Jail physicians fall to ob
serve any marked change ln his Condi
tionânothing but a slow ebbing of vital
ity.
Jones' crime has been long forgotten.
It was committed during a quarrel wlta
Dutll, whose head he crushed with a
bung-starter.

that through the fraudulent conversion
of $4C0O deposited in the bank in the name
of Smith's Cash Store the. firm was com

the amount sued for.
Smith alleges that on January 29. 1C0O.
he deposited in the bank J40CO, to provide
for the payment certain checks drawn
. upon the bank the day before, which
checks, he alleges, Were In favor of cer
tain merchants from whom Smith's Cash I
Store had purchased goods. The checks '
were forty-five in number and aggregated J
$3679 55.
- The checks were- presented for payment |

This action on the part of the bank, a!- j

1 says he was compelled to sell large quan- !
ft'.es cf goeds to raise funds to meel t'az.r \
demands. . . ' Â¦'Â¦Â¦â¢. Â¦ â¢ ;
Smith alleges' further that he was '
forced to borrow large sums of money j
for which he paid large sums In interest Â¦
in addition, to transferring the business i
of the firm to the lender for security.
-It was only because of the action ot!
the bank in refusing payment of. the

And What Makes It Ache.

Â¦ women are; who. find means to rid themselves of it. ,
A singular thing about backache Is that it -Is frequently take* .for
rheumatism: or lumbago, and treated with surf^apPlIcaUons such^as
llnlme-nts and plaster^ which really make it a good deal worse, because
they increase the inflammation within. * >.--.v', t â¢ âÂ«â,Â«.
' The real article in the way of a woman's backache always com.s
from something of a serious nature in the kidneys or uterine Â«*!Â«*Â«*
it is wholly true that nothing will stop the backache while, the infLm
mation exists. : Tme.- too. it is that; to cure this condition. "^T^'
have most intelligent aid. I>octor 3 bungle over backache continually.
" as 1 indeed 'they do over most of women's troubles. Whether It is be-
cause women do not make their symptoms plain to 'them, or because they
are puzzled by the great variety of symptoms. I 'never could understand;
certain, however. It is that the women I know who have been trying for
years to get rid of backache have gone to a doctor right along, and none
of them have been benefited by the treatment. I have heard, too. of so
many other women having this same experience, that I think there is
something! about women's diseases difficult for a physician to diagnose
and treat.
In a general way, backache is a sort of neuralgia fed constantly from
a storm center in the kidneys or uterus. It Is- a nervous trouble which
sets up an irregularity in the circulation, clogging some of the blood cells
or vessels or veins with an instant and constant inflammation. Nor can
you stop this inflammatory process without you bring the nerves to a
normal state, and the difficulty of finding the right medicine for a woman's
nerves is the rock on which the doctor's efforts usually come to grief.
There is little doubt in my mind that the reason Lydla. Finkham'3
Compound is so effective in curing backache is because its action is on
the organs which control the movement of the blood. Ther^e is no ques-
' tion that Mrs. Pinkham's medicine is a great thing for women who hava
any disorder of the feminine organs or any backache or nervousness, so
that there must be a logical reason for its good work.
I know a great many women don't want to take Lydla E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound for the absurd reason that it is so well known, and
the equally absurd 1 reason that it is advertised.. Then, too, they dislike
to ask for it at the drug store. I have always noticed, however, that when
a woman buys her first bottle of this medicine she is so much improved
by it that she continues the medicine for several bottles, and becomes
thoroughly enthusiastic about the help it has been to her.
I think that all women with backache might take a hint from this
and make the small effort necessary to test Mrs. Pinkham's medicine, for
it does what no other treatment does I ever knew about, and certainly
what no ordinary physician's treatment doesâ It stops backache. It has
to my knowledge cured some distressing cases of it, and I have heard and
read of many more. You cannot well ignore these well-known facts
about this medicine, if you really want to get rid fit that eternal ache. It
; does cure others, thousands of ;, others, why not you?

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 29.
- With this plan in mind Poniatowski and
his associates commissioned the real es
tate firm to secure options for a tract
suitable for a passenger depot in the
midst of the . thickly populated districts.
The attempt was first made at Church
and Market streets, but much difficulty
was met. Some of the holders lived in
the East, and the unusual effort to get
four months' options caused some to place
prices Â¦ beyond all reason on their prop
erty. Attention was then turned to a
tract at Eleventh and Market streets, op
poslto Van Ness avenue. Here obstacles
of the same nature were met. j The agents
then â¢ approached holders of property in
the . block' bounded by Valencia, Elgin
Park, Thirteenth and Hermann streets.
Four months' options were secured from
a number of holders, $30 to $100 being paid
for options, varying with the stse and
value of. the holdings. Asking prices
leaped upward' some 400 per cent and the
agents again found themselves unable to
secure a suitable tract at figures within
reason, . and ' they so reported to Ponla
towekl. â¢
The Burllngamo promoter expects to en
tertain George Gould In San Francisco in
the near future, and if Gould arrives
events of the greatest importance to San
Francisco are to be expected. If the Cen
tral Pacific does .not offer acceptable
terms for traffic arrangements westward
from Salt Lake it is predicted that Gould
will rush through a coast extension of
tho Denver and Rio Grande, with San
Francisco in view as the ultimate ter
minus. / ' â¢ ' ..' Â¦ ' :<
When Thomas Magee & Sons . caused
realty values in the vicinity of the junc
ture of Market and Valencia streets to
jump several hundred per cent . a month
ago by trying to secure options on all the
holdings within certain blocks, the firm
was acting for Prince Poniatowski and
other local capitalists who have faith that
the Gould Interests will ultimately build
to the metropolis of the Pacific. The San
Franciscans who are interested in the
matter hope to be able to show the East
ern magnates how to reach the city by
the most advantageous route' when once
Gould and his associates learn that in
self-defense they must have an outlet to
the chief Beaport of the Pacific Coast.
Poniatowski contends that the next
transcontinental line that comes into San
Francisco must come by the San Mateo
route. He believes that the most prac
ticable route is to be found by avoiding
the Ocean View grades and expensive
cut by striking oceanward and proceeding
via the Lake Merced region and the Spring
Valley, Water Works. Entrance to, the
center of I population and business can be
secured, the Prince maintains, by tunnel-
Ing through the hills adjacent to the Twin
Peaks.

Dr. Deane finds that there are forty
four vessels at this port that are burning
fuel oil instead of coal. He predicts that
within two years there will not be a eln
. gle vessel regularly leaving the port of
San Francisco making steam with any
thing but oil. He estimates that the dis
placing of the 2,000,000 tons of coal an
nually Imported into California by the
use of oil would result in a saving per
annum of $12,000,000, at the rate of $5 per
ton for the coal. An Interesting feature
of Dr. Deane's report Is found In a list of
the vessels hailing from the port of San
Francisco -which have received permits,
from Supervising Inspector Bermingham
to use oil fuel, which is as follows:
The United States transport Meade uses
eighty tons of coal a day to make an average
of eleven knots, for which the Government
pays $8 50 per ton. Allotting for sixty days'
eteamlng to Manila and return it requires 4800
tons of coal, costing $il,O00. If she used oil
ehe would burn 19,200 barrels or 2955 tans. Al
lowing four barrels of oil to equal one ton of
coal, this oil would cost at $1 a barrel $19,200.
saving in fuel alone f 21,800.
Forty-Four Steamers.
Sir Marcus Samuel, president of the Shell
Transport and Trading Company, remarked In
a speech "that the greatest fact to be over
come In getting people to use liquid fuel was
prejudice. One gentleman said he knew all tha
advantages to be gained, but he would not
adopt it because the advantages were so pal
pable, and until he saw some disadvantages he
could not proceed. He (Sir Samuel) couhl say
emphatically there were no disadvantages to
liquid fuel whatever." The gentleman who
made this remark is president of a company
having twenty-five steamers burning oil. s.1
Showing the epeed with which this fuel can
be put aboard, one of the Hamburg-American
Unere, the C. Ferdinand Laersz, took on- at
Singapore 360 tons of crude oil, or 2140 barrels,
in two hours. : . '. j.*-,-.
consumption of Welsh coal would have been
lroct tons, or with Japanese or other varieties
to be procured in the east, 1500 tons, as
against 769 tons of oil. This company has
twenty-seven steamers, twenty-five of them fit
ted with oil burners giving perfect satisfaction.
The steamer Murex of the Shell Transport
and Trading Company. England, steamed from
Singapore to London via Cape Town, Africa, a
distance of 11,630 miles. The total amount o7
crude oil consumed on the ship was 5000 bar
rels of forty-two gallons each or 709 tons of
oil. The oil was stored In the forepeak The
vessel averaged 9.7 knots on 15.1 tons for the
main engines, and nearly two tons for the aux
iliary engines, each twenty-four hours. Had*
the ship been burning coal the corresponding
Striking: Examples.
Dr. Deane calls attention to the use of
fuel oil by Germany and Great Britain,
â¢which they have to Import thousands of
miles, "while we, with an unlimited sup
ply at our very door, stand hesitating and
wondering." Then Dr. Deane mentions
some striking and illustrative examples
of the use of oil tn steamers which are
given in substance for the general local
interest the subject possesses:
The burning of crude oil for steam pur
poses, especially on steam vessels, sup
plies the text for a review of a matter of
material Importance by Secretary C. T.
Deane of the California Petroleum Min
ers' Association. An idea of the practi
cal nature of the considerations Involved
may be inferred from one of the earlier
sentences in -Dr. Deane's report, which is
as follows: "If our leading financial men
will but grasp this subject and appreciate
the superior advantages that the nearness
of this vast supply of liquid fuel gives to
the port of San Francisco, they will
hasten the time by some years when San
Francisco will become the second port in
the United States."

Eastern people are showing in San Fran

The story published by a morning con
temporary to the effect that the South
ern Pacific Company is about to abandon
the advantage it has secured by the pur
chase of the old Risdon property and also
rights of way to the same to facilitate
its dealings with the wholesale commun
ity, which is so strongly building south
or Market street, is generally discredited.
The Southern Pacific people deny the
story that the land is to be put on the
market. The alternative would be to en
hance the competitive advantages of the
Santa Fe, which is not likely to become
the policy of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. . . '
Plans Jfavor Development.
The move of the Santa Fe to enter
Oakland is supposed by competent ob
servers to mean that the railroad peopie
see that in the many thousands of dwell
ers in Oakland, Berkeley and Alameda
there is a great business which ; the
Santa Fe has not heretofore enjoyed. To
reach Oakland, the Santa Fe goes
through Berkeley. That there will be a
ferry from Oakland to San Francisco,
when the Santa Fe gets ready to estab
lish it, goes with the saying, for it is a
common matter of knowledge ..that the
business of the local trains and ferries
of the Southern Pacific Company, which
the Santa Fe will be in a position soon to
share, is about ' the most profitable and
sure of any that Is going. The income
from the around the bay commuters is as
sure as taxes. *"â¢,â¢-.*
There are many reasons to "justify the
confidence in the local realty situation
that ia generally entertained. The first
is, of course, the constant and unparal
leled growth of the city, which is obvious
to all observers. The next, possibly, is
the very excellent prospect that the'im
migration movement, which is intended
to people adequately the great arid^ fruit
ful counties of the north of California,
will have the co-operation of all classes
of citizens and . will be conducted vigor
ously and so make the country tributary
to San Francisco more prosperous than
ever before. .

When he arrived at the office and real
ized that he was again to be placed un
der restraint, he became enraged. Draw
ing his knife from his pocket, he opened
it unobserved and made a slash at his
throat. Mrs. Culverwell saw the motion
just in time and instinctively grasped his
arm. He wrenched himself away and
again attempted to stab himself, but As
sistant Secretary Shannon interfered this
time. A lively struggle ensued and was
only ended, on the opportune arrival of

White to take- him Â¦ off her hands. "

NEW YORK, March 29. â The Financier says
this week: The bank statement of last week
showed a gain of $1,524,000 In cash. Instead of
the loss of $1,314,500, which was estimated from
the traceable movements of money up to
Wednesday night. The discrepancy may pos-
Fifcly be accounted for on the theory that the
receipts by the banks on and after Thursday
Â¦were In excess of the shipments, and that the
outward movement for the April settlement* did
not begin to be important until the close of the
bask week. The loans ehow a decrease of
$8,8.8.600. making $31,027,600 for the three
weeks since March 15, inclusive. The deposits
were reduced last week $7,881,300, - making
$40,313,400 in the three weÂ«ke. It Is note
worthy that in this interval the loss in cash
was only $301,500. The statement is nearly
harmonious, the net Ions resulting from the
decrease tn loans, less the gain In cash, being
only $526,700 below the amount of the reduc
tion in deposits. The reserve requirements
Â¦were lessened by $1,970,325, which, added to the
gain in cash, made an increase in surplus re
serves of $3,494,325. This item now stands at
$6,9G5,575, against $7,870,500 at the correspond
ing date last year. The losses of cash by the
banks, which will probably result from the
shipment* of money in response to the demand
for the April settlements, will, later in the cur
rent week, most llkely.be counterbalanced by
the return of this -money from nearby center*
after euch adjustments have been effected so
that the derangement to the money market
caused by the outflow will be temporary.

wheat was" to clear up deals. Reports from the
winter wheat belt continue to develop, bearish
sentiment. Rains and the warm weather helped
the growth of plants materially during the
week. Some of the Chicago crop experts in
Kansas reported 70 to 75 per cent of a crop for
that State. At the start there was fair buying
by a prominent professional to take in a long
line of shorts and there was also some Eastern
buying. business did not last long, but
the offerings continued In heavy surplus of the
demand, and prices collapsed temporarily. May
started %@%c lower to a shade higher at 71 Vic
to <lÂ»Â£e. advanced to 71 %c and then dropped
to the lowest that May has reached this
yearâ 70%c. This new level induced good short
covering and some investment purchases and a
recovery to 71 %c followed. May closed easy.

Snowing in Kansas and below freezing in the
Southwest started corn shorts to covering.
There could not. of course, be any growing of
grass with that temperature, and traders ar
gued & further need of corn for feeding. There
was a good demand most of the day and only
light offerings to meet it. May opened firm,

hog situation was still bullish. The chief buy

MINES AND MINING.
THE TACOMA COMPANY, Steel Corpora-
tion, of Washington, is "doing things,", as
tho following: dispatch printed in the New
York Commercial of March 15 will testify:
TACOMA, March 14.â About the busiest
place in town is the temporary office of the
Tacoma Company at 742 Pacific ave.
"I wish to say that I am in every way
pleased with ' the way in which the people
of Tacoma are taking hold of and furthering
this enterprise," said President Henry Hew-
itt. "The work Is progressing rapidly and
well â indeed, the stock is being taken much
faster than I had any reason to expect.
Money la coming In rapidly. If the present
pace is kept up we will have $500,000 In tha
treasury and be ready to begin shoveling dirt
by June 1.
SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIAL.
"Have Â« we secured all the mining prop-
erty wo desire? Yes; that Is. to say, we
have secured ground covering raw material
enough to carry out all the plans of
. the â¢ company. We have iron enough
to | feed all our proposed furnaces for
an indefinite number of years. And the best
of its- kind, too.- The fact In we havo not
only iron ore. but all tho material at hand,
easily and cheaply accessible, for the mak-
ing of Iron. The prospecting and experiment-
Ing stage Is past â we know exactly what
we've got. We have been talking about the
iron deposits of this Northwest for a lonÂ«
time. Ten years ago I did not bslleve In
them, but the conviction has been grow-In*
and now I know because I have seen. - I
have been on the ground and seen the hill
pltrced in all directions â there are Immense
quantities of it.
OUTLOOK FOR PRODUCT.
"What remains Is to turn the ore into pig-
iron. That Is the first step. All things else
in the Iron and steel line will follow. We
have but to pile up iron in the yards hero
and the long procession of industries that
work In that metal will assembles here. Tho
iron will . be Â¦ turned into steel and every
ship will carry away some of our finished
products â products ranging from rails to tha
steel framework ot the modern buildings.
More than that â the ships themselves will
be built here, for the steel ship Is the mod-
ern ship. This is not ; a fancy. - We are
aware of the market for manufactured Iron
and steel of every description.. It is a grow-
' ing market. . It is here in the West. The
freight bill saved would Itself appeal to the
average business man. So I say that where
the ' blast furnaces are there likewise will
be the nail factory, the steel works, the
saw factory, and so on down the line, even
'â¢ to steel ship yards.
"The mines? They are principally those
at Texada. There -are not only iron, â¢ but
copper properties, and. besides, limestone.
They were acquired ' at practically nominal
figures, all except the copper mines. â¢ â¢
LOCATION FOR PLANT.
"With regard to the location of the big
works, I have this to say: These tide flats
out here are the logical location for such an
undertaking. Here is the room we need,
where transportation by ship and rail Is
equally convenient. The great desideratum In
the' manufacture of iron â after you've, got
your ore â is fuel. Here we â¢ have this, per-
haps a little more readily available than at
any other point. I am pleased to say that
we are being met in a spirit calculated to
bring the matter to a epeedy and satisfac-
tory conclusion."
A STRONG COMPANY.' ,
The Tacoma Company has the indorsement
of the biggest mercantile agency in the coun-
try â an agency . that indorsee only after the"
. most rigid investigation.

lCjo. CaL, March 4. 1002.
Dr. G. S. Moore, 352 O'Farrell St., San
Franciscoâ Dear Doctor: Please send three
bottles of your hair restorer. I have used
two^ bottles and I find It the best remedy I
have ever used, and I think I have tried al-
most everything I have heard of ! and never
found anything that wottld stop it from fall- -
Ing. Your remedy stopped it from falling
and I am astonished to see how thick the
new hair is all over my head with the two
bottles. I do not think I will need more than
the present order, but I shall try and keep
some on hand to. clean my scalp with. My
head never felt so well as now. Yours truly,
GEORGE BUNNER.

Orders have been issued for the annual
inspection and muster of the various or
ganizations of the Second Brigade as fol
lows:
A large number of ladies and gentle
men were on Van Ness avenue last Mon
day night to witness the guard mount, es
cort of the colors and battalion parade of
the First Artillery. The several forma
tions were made with promptitude and
precision. It is the intention of the offi
cers to have the ceremonies and battalion
drill every month. At guard mount Cap
tain Nlppert acted as the new officer of
the day, and Captain Petty as the old
ofHcer, with Lieutenants Varney, Grat
tan, Neumann and Hyer as officers of the
guard. After the parade the four bat
teries, under the command of the first
sergeants, passed in review before Major
Bush, commander of the battalion, and.
the other officers. . .
Parade on Van Ness Avenue.
After citing the example of McLaw'a
division at Fredericksburg behind a stona
fence repulsing six successive charges oÂ£
the Federal troops and other incidents of
the war of 1361-tJo, he turned to hasty in
trenchments, how, -when and where to
make them. The first proposition is de
pendent upon the amount of penetration
of the steel-jacketed bullets in various
substances, such as earth, clay and sand,
which is determined by experiments. Two
and a half feet of loose earth or one and
a half feet of sand affords protection from
a bullet that will penetrate eighteen
Inches of solid oak, and such a bullet
will not penetrate more than four feet Into
snow. The form of intrenchment is de
pendent upon the heights over which the
average man can fire lying, kneeling and
standing â one foot, three feet and four
and a half feet respectively. A considera
tion, however, enters Into, the problem,
and that Is the danger a high embank
ment entails on the defenders If struck
by an artillery projectile, while on the
other hand a lack of embankment leaves
much ground in front that cannot be cov
ered by flre. In view of this, a compro
mise trench has been decided upon as a
type or standard, subject to modifications
as circumstances may require. Shelter
trenches should be made at the time of
battle, unless, when acting on the de
fensive, an attack is expected; this for
the purpose of economizing labor. In de
ciding where trenches should be made, it
is necessary to consider the usual form
of cross section of a hill or ridge. Cap
tain Beach then stated that at San Juan
Hill the Spaniards occupied trenches in
the form, of a single ditch, about four feet
deep, with vertical sides and no embank
ments, where they remained completely
concealed, except when they rose at com
mand and delivered a volley, an operation
requiring but a few seconds, but these
trenches were so faultily placed that Am
erican caaualities ceased as soon as our
troops approached the foot of the hill, the
Spanish trenches not being on the mili
tary crest, but back of it. Trench work
In the Philippines waa like that of the
Spanish in Cuba, the main idea being to
afford opportunity for an unexpected vol
ley and then a safe exit from one end of
the trench into a thicket or low ground,
concealed from the attackers. In conclu
sion, the captain said that the successful
manner to assault trenches is to keep the
occupants busy by a weak flre from the
front and then make an energetic flank
attack with the best men, carrying out
the wise maxim of General Sheridan â
"Learn one correct way of doing what
ever may be required of you in a military
line, for only then is It safe to experi
ment with ideas of your own." - . Â¦
Value of Breastworks.
At the meeting of the Artillery Battalion
in thft Ellis-street Armory last Wednesday
night Captain W. D. Beach, Third United
States Cavalry, delivered a very Interest-
Ing lecture on hasty, or battle ihtrench
ments. The captain said that by hasty or
battle intrenchments he meant the quickly
made earth embankments by which an
army in the presence of the enemy pro
tects Itself from, hostile fire, which shel
ters may be for single skirmishers, for
single rank lying, for double rank kneel
ing or standing or for support of the re
serves, and he cited a number of In
stances to show the fatÂ« of an army on
the battle-field depended on the use or
neglect of such. The first extensive usa
of such intrenchments on the field of bat
tle, he said, occurred in the Civil War.
and that the methods adopted by Sher
man's army are matters of history and
demonstrated the value of the suggestion
of General Cox that ore man behind an
lntrenchment on the defensive Is equal to
three or four In the attack. This con
clusion of General Cox was verified by
the experience of General Lawton'8 di
vision at JE1 Caney during the recent
Spanish-American War, when it required
a ten-hour fight by 5000 men of , the- best
army the . world ever knew to capture
trenches manned by one-tenth Its num
ber. One of the most careful military
students of the United States Army re
cently declared that In future wars odds
of 10 to 1 will be necessary to successfully
assault trenches behind which are good
men armed with magazine rifles.

Mrs. Angle, Cunningham, and Mrs.

the experiment was one that it will not

To do the, trick the bigapeis sent to a
platform well up In. the rafters and from
which a- rope is stretched at an angle to
the floor below. Bosco attaches a pulley
to; the (rope and, holding on to its end
gives itself a start. In a second or two
the animal lands in a net that Is held for
It below. During its playtime yesterday
Bosco tried the act without the aid of the
net. When the, monk reached the floor It
was. -with. a hard and sudden finish Its
yells could be heard, throughout the bie
building. An examination showed that
beyond a few bruises Bosco was unhurt
though it took Â¦-. considerable coaxing to
have it do : Its act in the evening.

Â¦ W hy the railroad company should discrimin
ate against the .miner is hard to understand.
This new policy 'will: greatly retard the devel
opment'of the mineral resources of . this sec
tion,' and we Â¦ believe the ' railroad company is
standing in its own light in taking this stand.
In one way . it will be a benefit to the tax
payer. . The Assessors of the several counties
can raise the valuation of railroad lands from
50 cent3 per acre to $4 or $5, and this will
help . defray expenses in building roads, etc.
if the find or prospect was a rich one, the
pries would be still higher. <
This Is a matter which- if true deserves the
serious consideration of every man, woman
and child living along the line of. the rail
road. The average prospector does not have
5500 or anywhere near it to buy land with,
and he naturally will not, look for gold when
he knows some one el3e can step in and buy
from under him. ' The company will sell agri
cultural , land on time, but for some reason

Under the heading of quartz mines Ne

have 234 such properties. The place*
mines of the county number 26 and tne
hydraulic mines five. The latter mines
are located respectively at Nevada City
(2), North San Juan, Dutch Flat ana
North Bloomfield. The mills and arastras
make. a. good list, numbering seventy
seven in alL Under the heading of mis
cellaneous mines are Included copper
claims, barites and caJcite, kaolin and
granite and marble, the last being black,
mottled and variegated. Grass Valley
and Nevada City naturally loom up in
prominence in connection "with the min
ing industries of Nevada County. These
two places are the center of at least 192
mining enterprises. They also have a
great share- of the mills, having credited
to them 40 out of a total of 77 in the
county. Electricity makes a smaller
showing as motive power for the mills
than might be supposed. In fact there
are only four electrical plants credited In
the register, which belong respectlvey to
the Brunswick mill, the Gold Hill, the
Pennsylvania and the W. Y. O. D., all
near Grass Valley. Water and steam are
used in the majority of the mills operat
ing. Gasoline as a motive power is em
ployed at the Rose Hill mine only. There
are several mines at an elevation, ap
proximatey, of one mile above the sea
level in Nevada County, as the following

The mineral wealth of Nevada County,
California, forms the subject of the
latest register issued by the State Min
ing Bureau. Like preceding registers for
other counties the purpose of the one re

drift, hydraulic, placer, etc., as well as
to supply a llst'of mills and arastras; also
to supply Information relative to each of
the minerals mined or commercially used.
With the register is a topographical map
showing all mineral locations. The mines
are numbered ln a table and the corre
sponding number on the map gives the
precise location of the mining property.

One year before Wells' defeat for Mayor
San Francisco gave the Republican na
tional ticket 10,000 majority and won the
trophy, which signifies that San Fran
cisco is the banner Republican County ol
California. Gage's election in 1898 was due
in a measure to the fact that Burns and
Herrin were kept in the background.
Judge Carpenter aptly remarks: "There
was seme doubt in 1S98 whether Gage was
the railroad's candidate, but there is no
doubt in this campaign." It may be
Burns' policy to get all the State patron
age that can be obtained from this ad
ministration and then drop Gage. The
politicians, however, - contend that Herrin
and Burns will fight to the finish for
Gage's renomination, and if successful
will undertake the work of manipulating
the Democratic State Convention with the
purpose of securing the nomination of
pome weak man or blatant demagogue as
Gage's opponent.
Is Banner County.
There was a notion at first that nerrin,
Burns and Gage might â¢ get together a
day or two before the I convention and
programme the ticket from top to bottom,
but the expressions of the independent
Republican newspapers of the, State have
convinced the politicians that the people
â¢will not stand for that sort of machine
Â¦work. Alliances on the .part of candi
dates for Lieutenant Governor, Treasurer,
Secretary of State, Attorney General,
State Printer, Controller, Surveyor and
Superintendent of Schools may be found
desirable for Gage, but they will do no
good to the aspirants for minor offices.
In the late municipal campaign all the
Republican aspirants for otnee from the
IÂ»ayor down turned over their delegations
to Burns and Herrin. The ticket was pre
pared for the convention and adopted by
the delegates without a break in the pro
gramme. The result was defeat at the
polls, as twenty thousand Republican
voters in the city refused to accept boss
orders. It is now dawning on the minds
of many politicians that Burns is a Bour
bon. He learns nothing and forgets noth
ing. He lost the campaign for Estee; he
lost his own campaign, and, to cap the
climax, lost the campaign for Wells.
People Disfavor Machine.
The State campaign will be further en
livened by an army of aspirants for the
nomination for Attorney General on the
Republican ticket. It is now regarded as
certain that Tirey L. Ford will be ap
pointed to the responsible position of at
torney for the United Railways cf San
Francisco, and therefore will not be a
candidate for another term as Attorney
General. As long as the impression ex
isted that Ford would be a candidate be
fore the convention for renomination,
there seemed to be no inclination to put
any one forward to oppose blm, because
his abilities as a lawyer and his fidelity
to the public interests were recognized
throughout the State. The politicians as
sert that he can have another term in
the- office of Attorney General if he so
desires, but inside intelligence is to the
effect that he is out of tne race 'and the
Held Is open to all comers.
A few months ago the candidates for
the favor of the Republican State con
vention were anxious to obtain a footing
in the Gage camp, but their ardor in this
respect has weakened in the light of sub
sequent developments.
