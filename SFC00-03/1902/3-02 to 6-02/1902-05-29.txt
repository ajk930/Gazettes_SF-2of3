HILL'S HORSE â¢ FAILS.
FORT DE FRANCE, island of .Martin
ique; May 28.â Professor Robert T-: Hill,
United States geologist and head of the
expedition sent to Martinique by the Na
tional Geographical Society, who left Fort
de "Fra'rice"Mohday*on'horseback~for "the
volcano, returned here" this morning. He
was , completely. ..worn., out w by, .his., trip.
Professor Hill relates an interesting story
of the examination of the district through
which he passed. He left Fort- de. France
Monday afternoon. He was accompanied
by a Mr. Cavanaugh, an army officer,'
from the.British island of Trinidad, arid
a boy named Joe, who was to act as
Interpreter. The party set 1 out on horse
back and took the direct north road for
Morne Rouge. Between the hamlets of
Deux Choux e.nd- Fonds. St Denis the
party entered upon the outer edge of the
zone of ashes. ' Except for occasional
patches all the country to this point was
green -and smiling. Upon reaching the
Ralbaud plantation, />ne mile southwest
of St. Pierre, .the explorer met the clear
line of demarcation of the zone of flame
and destruction, although not of/annihila^;
tion. Monday night was spent in a de"
serted bouse- at Fonds St..'Denls. ; . from
which Hill witnessed arid studied the vo\
canlc. eruption of that night. At , this
point, the horses of the party, became ex
hausted.

Scientist Gives His Version of His
HILL'S TERRIBLE TRIP. '
Hill will not discuss the matter, but
ether men of science here agree that the
cexditfons now known to exist are more
threatening than thofee that were ob
wrved before the ' destruction of Â¦ SL
Pierre. Hill has also explained . that the
terrific I lightning in the , clouds Monday
night *as caused by the ignition of thÂ«
gases thrown off by Mont Pelee, com
tinlngVith the oxygen in the air. This,
he believes, offers the best explanation
of thÂ« destruction of Et. Pierre/ 'Hill
eaye that the entire northern end" of the
island la too dangerous at this ' time to
permit 'further investigation. .

In our annals and which will forever redound

So great is the country's prosperity and so
ample the revenues under the Dingley tariff
law that the present Republican Congress has
been able to redeem party pledges by -repeal-
Ing war â¢ revenues aggregating $110,000,000
annually, thus reducing taxation to a peace
basis, while the army is still' on a war footing.
Democratic success would threaten the destruc

splendid prosperity has come, and the mere

The convention was distinguished for
harmony in all that was done. One .of
the "last reconciliations was that of Sen
ator Hanna and former. Governor Asa S.
Bushnell . of Springfield. The latter had
been here all week, but Bushnell and
Hanna never spoke as they passed each
other's quarters. They had not spoken
since the memorable contest for the Sen
etorfihip in 1837. Before going to the con
vention to-day they met in the most cor
dial manner. The delegates who "got them
together" gave glowing reports around
the convention hall of the way they wei - e
calling each -other "Mark" and "Asa" 1

William Kirtley Jr. of Defiance.

on all ballots, but Cox supported none
of the winners. In making up the State
ticket Hanna and Cox were on opposite
sides to-day, the same as in the contest
for the organization of the Â¦ Legislature
last January, but good feeling prevailed
after the convention was over.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 28.â The Re
publican. State Convention, which has
been a continued ovation to Senator
Hanna, closed this evening with a great
demonstration in his honor, to which he
respqnded in a characteristic speech. The
Senator .at former State conventions has
sounded keynotes that have been taken
up by Republican glee clubs. He, told
them to-day to sing "Keep on Letting
Well Enough Alone" in the campaign
rallies this year. He advised action and
counseled discretion.

Burrows of Michigan then addressed the
Senate on the general features of the
pending bill. He said he believed the time
had come when the future course of this
Government as to the islands must be de
termined. If the present course was to be
followed he thought that fact could not
be too clearly pointed out. He believed
the enactment of the measure of the ma
jority would promote the interests of the
Filipinos and advance the prosperity qt
the islands. Burrows said he did not be
lieve that the* Filipinos were fitted for
self-government. If he tnought they wero
ho would unhesitatingly urge tbat inde
pendence be granted them. Burrows In
conclusion maintained 1 that the adoption
of the, majority report on this bill was
the only safe and honorable course for
the United States to take.
Hoar to-day presented a letter from
General M. P. Miller,; U. S. A., correcting
what he said was an error in a recent
speech by Hoar, who had said that Gen
eral Miller "notoriously did want an at
tack and Aguinaldd met it with speedy
defiance," the reference being tq the is-
suance by General Miller of President Me-
Kinley's proclamation, : a part of which
was suppressed by General Otis."- .
In his letter General Miller said Hoar
was in error. He said General Otis had
not informed him that the President's
proclamation was not to be used in. full.
He was not anxious, he said, for a fight,
and always had- advised the Filipinos Jo
accept . tho sovereignty of the United
States, as he believed the United States
would grant them their reasonable de
sires. Hoar said the letter evidently was
that of a sincere and. honest gentleman.
He absolutely acquitted Ge'neral Miller of
publishing the proclamation in order to
bring on hostilities. ; . . . .
Lodge offered some amendments to the
bill, all being of minor tni&ortance- except
those reducing the amount of land to be
taken up by one person from 160 acres to
forty acres. The amendments were
agreed to. Lodge said the. Philippine
Committee had not determined yet what
change, if any, should be made in the
provision of the bill enabling a corpora
tion to acquire 5000 acres of land. He
thought some change > In the Â¦ provision
might be made, but what it would be he

At the conclusion of General Gros
venor*s address the platform was reported
by General Dick, chairman of the Com
mittee on resolutions. The references to
Roosevelt, Hanna, Foraker and Governor
Nash were loudly applauded. On General
Dick's motion the resolutions were adopt
ed. The platform is substantially as fol
lows: s . ,
Referring to trusts, the speaker de
clared that Republican officials were the
only ones that ever had made any prac
tical efforts to- meet this great question
and called attention to the contest now
going on in the courts for the disruption
of the so-called beef trust.
AS TO THE TBTJSTS.
Incidental to this schedule is the question of
wider markets. We Cannot go on forever add
lns to the volume of our production and yet fall
to gain wider markets. The problem of the day
Is the problem of new markets for American
products. Reciprocity must. not be used to de
stroy home industries. Reciprocity must- not ba
made use of to lessen the wages of the Ameri
can laborers or to curtail the scope of their
employment. But reciprocity may be used to
open the markets of other countries to the
productions of our country and thereby and in
that way make it possible to give more wages
and more hours of labor to the American
workman.
The vital question for the Republicans at
this particular time is the Question of when
an-1 how and by whom any revision of the tariff
which is deemed important shall be made.
What Is there In the portents of the times that
Indicates a necessity for any revision of the
tariff schedules of the Dlnslev act? We have
unbounded prosperity. Is that the time to
commence a tariff agitation that shall unsettle
values and disturb the peace of business and
precipitate Into commotion the business in
terests of the United States? That is the im
portant question and a question which in my
opinion can only be answered In thts way. Un
til injurious results to business and prosperity
are known to have been produced by the ex
istence of tariff 'schedules, the time has not
cemj to enter upon a revision of that docu
ment.
Grosvenor declared that the Republican
party does not worship the schedules of
the tariff as a fetich, but. favors revision
whenever the requirements of business
demand it. He added.'
The Philippines are ours. They are ours
by the conquest of Dcwey and the army; they
are ours by â¢ the terms of the treaty with
Spain; they are ours by every principle of law,
national, and international; and the American
people will never consent to the introduction
Into political power of a party that would play
the eld piratical game of "scuttle", and run
away from responsibility even as great as It is
la the fear of God and in the name of
American civilization, we will control and gov
ern and benefit those islands, and we will re
peat in the Philippines, on a larger scale, what
we hava accomplished so vbrllllantly in the isl
and of Porto Rico. The American flag ha-j
never been pulled down from any territory that
it ever claimed Jurisdiction over and It never
will be Dulled down while the Republican
President is in the White House.
SPEECH OF GBOSVENOB.
i After a feeling reference to the death
of President McKinley and a strong in
dorsement of the administration of Presi
dent Roosevelt the speaker turned to the
Philippine question. He said:
The reports of the committees on cre
dentials, rules and order of business were
submitted and' adopted. The report mak
ing General Charles H. Grosvenor perma
nent'chairman and continuing the re
mainder of thei temporary organization
was adopted. When Governor Nash pre
sented General Grosvenor he received an
ovation. â¢ â¢
; Secretary Laylin said they were equally
united now for Senator Hanna to succeed
himself, although hot so distinctly positive
in expressing preferences in advance for
President and Governor. This reference
to the Governorship was enjoyed by ths
delegates, who have during the week wit
nessed the dress parade here of half a
dozen or more aspirants for the guber
natorial nomination next year.
Many ladies attended the convention to
day, among them being Mrs. Hanna, who
occupied a front seat on the platform, but
she and the ladies with her left the hall
before the Senator was called out for the
closing speech.
In accepting renomination at the head
of the State ticket Secretary of State
Lewis C. Laylin referred to the State Con
vention at Zanesvllle in 1S95, at which the
so-called triple alliance was entered into
that Included Bushnell for Governor, For
aker for Senator and McKinley for Presi
dent. ' â¢
Cochrane of Missouri supported the
Newlands amendment, at the same time
denouncing the bill. He warned the mem
bers of the majority that the time would
ccme in their defense, of the proposed leg
islation when they would be as "jackrab
bits before the hounds."
Without action upon either amendment
the House at 4:50 p. m. adjourned.
nor rsash and others were also cheered.
General Grosvenor was heartily leceived
as the permanent chairman, as was Gen
eral Dick when he read the resolutions
which were adopted substantially as he
had drafted them, with the exception ,of
the Cuban resolution, on which .there was
a compromise. Â¦ .
Grow of Pennsylvania offered an amend
ment providing that the subsidiary coins
should consist of half-dollars, quarter
dollars, 10-cent and 5-cent pieces of pro
portionate parts of 112% grains.
To this amendment Newlands of Ne
vada offered an amendment providing
that such coins should be a full legal; ten
der for all debts, public and private.
Hill made the point of order that the
amendment to the amendment was not
germane. The point of order was over
ruled.
Smith of Iowa argued in support of the
bill that instead of being a measure, of
contraction it would increase the amount
of money in circulation to the extent of
the silver bullion coined (over $60,000,000).
The bill stirred the opposition of the
Democrats, who' claimed it was only a
step in the direction of the complete
striking down of the silver dollar. The de-
Jaate drifted into a general discussion of
the silver question. Very little interest
was shown, and Cochrane twice made the
'Â¦Â¦ point that no quorum was present. â¢ X. '
WASHINGTON, May 28.â The House
spent the day, debating the bill to in
crease the subsidiary coinage by coining
the silver bullion in the treasury and to
recoin standard silver dollars as the pub
lic necessities may require. The limit of
subsidiary coinage is now $100,000,000.' Tha
bill increases this to an indefinite amount,
in the discretion of the Secretary of the
Treasury. Â¦ 1

I believe in organized labor and I believe in
organized casltal as auxiliary. These 'two
great forces are working out the destinies of
the country. They. must be ably arid honestly
administered and they must be controlled. Our
prospects are bright, and as I have said be
fore, we have entered uuon this contest full of
hope because we are right, v and we will get
there. .
My friends, as we enter upon this contest
In our State let us remember our martyred
President, and inspired by the policies to. which
he had devoted his life, which has made this
country great and prosperous, let his spirit
guide us, and under that inspiration let us go
forward, every man, with a determination to
vindicate these policies. A new era is dawn
ing upon this country. Our great development
has reached a point that has placed us in the,
fronx rank of nations, not only by the power
and weirht of our affairs, but also we have,
become the greatest manufacturing and Indus*
trial nation of- the world. That development is
a natural consequence of the evolutions that!
are going on. Labor and canltal are approach
ing each other in the proper spirit. \ '
Weighing everything in the balance arid
praying to hia own highest authorityâGod
he came to the conclusion that the best thing
for us and for them was that we i micht ex
tend to them all the blessings of a free sov
ernment, controlled by a power which knew
what free governmesit meant. : That ' was -a
policy born of the best thought and the best
efforts that could be exercised fqr the- good of
those people who had come into our hands, and
without the aid of a party that" had much to
do wfth bringing on the war with Spain tor
the elevation of their race and the'sarearr of
Christian morality. That was the Inspiration
of McKinley; that was the motive. of all the
people of the United States. > When, as a "re
sult of that policy, we are confronted -with the
conditions that we find to-day, shall we fol

of a' party to thwart us in the work of, hu

ADDRESS BY HANNA.
There were loud and repeated calls for
Senator Hanr.a and the greatest demon
stration of the convention occurred as he
was being escorted to the platform. He
eald:
We proudly reaffirm our faith In all the great
cardinal principles of the Republican party,
and our allegiance to the declaration adopted
by the last Republican national convention and
to the candidates named by this convention we
pledge our loyal support.
In a Government like ours there is no place
for anarchy, and we demand that Congress en
act stringent laws against attempts on â¢ the
life of the Chief Magistrate, or of any person
In the line of succession. A murderous ' attack
' on the President Is &, blow struck at the Gov
ernment Itself and should be punished aa
treason is punished. Our laws guarantee lib
erty of speech and of the press, but afford no
license for the teachings or practice of an
archy. We also denounce lynchings and all
forms of mob violence.
The American army has taken up a work
of establishing order and maintaining authority
In the distant Philippines, and while we deplore
end severely condemn any instances of cruelty
Â¦which may have occurred, we remember that
cur soldiers are fighting a barbarous and
treacherous foe. who have often inflicted most
Inhuman and revolting atrocities upon their
prisoners. It is the nation's army, drawn from
â¢very section of -the country, knowing no-poli
tics nor creed, but fighting the nation's battles
under tbe nation's flag, and we resent with in
dignation recent Democratic efforts to drag Its
honor In the dust and to cast reproach on its
fair name. ... .> .
PROGRESS IN" PHILIPPINES.
TVe congratulate the President and the army
tipon the satisfactory progress made in the
Philippines in suppressing insurrection and es
tablishing order, and we unqualifiedly indorse
the policy of our Government in those islands.
The war with Spain was forced upon us against
cur will, and the Philippines came to us as
one of the results of that conflict. We are re
sponsible for peace and order in the islands and
our sovereignty must be as absolute as our
responsibility. Our title to the islands is as
perf ect as was that of Spain after nearly 400
years of undisputed possession. We will give
their people better government, better schools,
niore civil and political rights, and a higher
civilization and broader freedom than is pos
sible for them In any other way. Our flag is
la tbe Philippines, and there it will remain.
Additions to our territory since 1897 have
been fully Justified, both by improved condi
tions In the islands themselves and the im
proved commercial relations between them and
the United States. These islands will not be
exploited for the sain of adventurers, but will
be developed for the "mutual benefit pf their
own people and honest investors, and will In
time make the United States a complete com
mercial entity, capable of producing within its
own area practically all the articles required
for the daily life and comfort of man.
concessions upon American products, so as to
benefit the trade of both countries and to fully
and generously carry out every obligation of
our national honor, whether expressed or im
plied.
We congratulate the new republic of Cuba
upon the final fruition of the hopes and strug
g-les cjfttfr pepple for freedom and independ
ence, jfejt^efcojo* her to the family of na
tions. * fcy# wish her success and prosperity,
peace and happiness. For such part as we. as
a nation, have had in assisting her to achieve
Independence, we a?k no guerdon rave that
v.hlch we have â l\ie gratitude of a. freÂ« people.
Furthermore, we believe it is due alike to Cuba
and to ourselves that, in accordance v.ith th*
republican principle! of reciprocity, proper and'
reasonable trade concessions shall be - made
by our Government to Cuba, in return fpr her
la now being vigorously upheld by a Republit
can administration in the prosecution of un
lawful combinations. Subsequent to the enact
ment of this law the Democratic party obtained
control of both branches of Congress and the
Presidency. It constantly asserted hostility to
trusts, but failed to place upon the statute
books a single line of legislation which would
aid in their control.

packing concerns ' at the . Union Stock
yards shall not yield to the demands of
the striking ' teamsters within a short
time it may result in a general stoppage
of 40,000 employes at the yards. Already
several hundred persons have quit. The
situation is becoming so involved that It
apparently will be impossible for the
union men to remain at work much
longer without violating the rules of the
Chicago Federation of Labor, under
which they hold charters.
A strike among the beef butchers or
hog butchers, or any other set of men
men upon whom hundreds of other* are
dependent, would cause a complete tie
up in every branch. This is said to-be
not unlikely, because in many instances
union men nave been asked to do the
work of the strikers and have been dis
charged upon refusing. Furthermore,
union men are forbidden to handle goods
that have been prepared by non-union
labor, and it is said to bo nearly imprac
ticable for the men to continue without
doing this. - . -
Conferences between several of the
firms and representatives of the union
were held this afternoon In an effort to
adjust the. trouble, but the packers re
fused to concede any of the demands of
the strikers, and the probability of an
early settlement seems as remote a3 on
the first day of the tie-up. To-nlgnt 225
box-makers . employed by the National
Box Company's plant at Thirty-eighth
street and Center avenue struck because
they had been asked to furnish boxes to
the packers against whom the teamsters
are struggling.
The American Express Company re
fused to-day to handle meat because or
the fear that its drivers, who are mem
bers of the Teamsters' Union, would
strike if asked to haul meat.
The great university of the future will ba
the one which does well whatever it under
takes, be it . high or low. Better have few
departments, very few. . than that any should
be weak and paltry. . Better few students well
taught than many neglected.
The college course should have a little of the
professional spirit for Its guidance, a little of
the university spirit for its inspiration; the
best interests of all three will keep them In
th>> closest relation to each other.
Â¦ It should be broad - enough and thorough
enough to develop cultured manhood, and . at
tho same time to furnish the' strength needed
to reach this filial. ; ' ' . â¢
Th~c best education for any man with brains
and character should Involve these tRree ele
ments :
It should have the final goal In view as soon
as possible. â¢
After submitting meekly to the decrees
of the Dawson authorities for several
months, the gamblers have attempted to
reopen their games in spite of the* police:
About a month ago several upstairs re
sorts were opened, all kinds of gambling
games being started, from black jack to
draw poker and faro. The police deter
mined to put a stop to this a week later,
and the result was, that several houses
were raided, but the' gamblers decided 'to
fight it out in court. The usual proof was
submitted, .but to the surprise of every
one the gamblers gained the day. on the
ground that It was not shown that money
changed hands or was even in sight. Now
the games are running full, blast.
to a few things done thoroughly It is possible
to i give even the ' undergraduate some touch
of real . university method, some knowledge of
how truth is won. To accomplish this is one
vital part of the university's duty. It welds
together the three functions of a university,
and In so doing it will give tbe American uni
versity its most characteristic feature.
The clean-up la further advanced to-day
than ever before at this time of year and
results were | never more satisfactory.
Some of the largest nuggets ever found in
the Klondike have been taken out of the
lower bedrock on El Dorado. Officiate of
the Gold Commissioner's office estimate
the season's output at from $23,000,000 to
$26,000,000. \ . Â¦ -- .;. .

'. Mike Fisher's Senators 'nfever had a
chance to get within the'money limit over
at fewlng's ' playgfoflnd yesterday after
noon. The paraders made three dents in
ihe score card the first rattle out of the
box. This was enough to put them first
iti the running, but just for a little
amusement they got In and made the cir
cuit twice more before the trouble ceased.
It ended with Oakland 5, Sacramento 1.
. The wind was blowing so hard that all
bewhiskered individuals wore masks on
<beir faces, and the fair attendants tied
rcpes around their waists and lashed
themselves to the seats of the grand
stand. The Oakland players all had
Japanese stoves concealed on their per
sons to keep warm. Mike Fisher neglect
ed to buy any heaters for his tossers, and
this is one of the reasons why they ran
'second. There were several other reasons,
which the score explains.
Peter Dowllng was selected by Fishar
â¢to toss them in the direction of the home
l>!ate, but Peter forgot his orders and
threw in every other' direction.
Hodson mixed up the dope for the pa
laders and, barring a little wildness in
ihe early stages of the game, his work
â¢looked good. He allowed only a single
hit for seven rounds. The three which
<ame after that did no damage. He was
mperbly supported by the stonewall in
lieid and the brickwall outfield, so there
was but little danger of any Senatorial
scoring going on.
Four bases on balls, a wild pitch and a
batpman hit gave Oakland three runs in
1 tit opening spasm. A batsman hit, a sac
rifice and a single by Streib added an
other In the fourth, and Streib's triple
and McCreedies eingle in the sixth lln
lshed the run getting.
Doyle walked In the first, was sacrificed
to second by Hulen and scored for Sacra
mento on Kgan's drive to left. Francks
played a brilliant game at short. Sheehan
robbed Mohler cf a double by a sensa
tional one-hand catch.
Manager Fisher announces he has se
cured Cutter, the -Santa Clara College
pitcher and all-around athlete, to pitch
for Sacramento. He Is expected to arrive
in a few days.
OAKLAND.
Manager Harris has written a long let

he was in his prime. In the first round
he made a good showing and then col
lapsed. His vitality, that Intangible Qual
ity, had disappeared.

little wild in his boxing, and to "tone him
up" arranged a practice bout with Young
Glbbs. In this practice LavJgne broke a
small bone in his left arm. This was four
months ago,- and he reappears to-night
making a fresh start to regain his laurels.
From outward appearances he is the
Lavigne of old. He looks in the most rug

which hides physical weakness only the

is the direct outcome of the recent announcements of the world's greatest scientists, and Is a practical admission on the part
of physicians of the power of^Electricity over drugs as a curative agent.
I have known for tw*niy years that drugs could not restore strength. My knowledge was obtained from actual contact with
thousands of people who had tried drugs' In every term, and they were worse off than before they Â¦tarted drugging. Why don't
drugs cure? If the keam In an engine haB run down,} will oiling the parts make It so? No. You must get; op more steam.
Drugs; have no more effect on the bodythan'oll on an engine. Electricity can, and does, make the body go just as It makes a ma-
chine go.; I have proven In, 60,000. cases that Electricity Is the substance: of life and organic vitality, and have perfected the
best known means of replenishing -this force in the body^when It Is lost. My Electric Belt. Is the natural result of scientific
study, coupled with skill. There can be no pain or weakness where my appliance is used. . . -
"i The current supplied by, this Appliance enters the 1 body in a glowing stream of vitalizing heat, so gentle that the nervWand
vital organs, absorb it as freely as a^hungry ,-babe drinks milk. This foreÂ© 13 added to the natural power generated by the stom-

charged with betrayal under promise of
marriage by Miss Hattie Bynum, was
called in Judge Cabaniss' court yesterday

When -the honors had been conferred
Bishop Nichols' addressed, the graduates
and asked the question as to whether the
constitution followed the flag or the flag
the constitution. -- He said he was sure
of one thing, and especially sure after
his recent trip to the Hawaiian Islands,
'and that was that the American boy fol
lowed the flag, and further, the American
boy as he showed in his games and nis
prowess, asked a fair field and no favor.
The American soldier-boy, he said, had
followed - the flag and he, , the Bishop,
tcok^io stock in those who would depre
ciate the soldier-boy of the country from
a desire to magnify phases of war that,
however sad, I were unavoidable in war
fare. He congratulated Trinity School
for the genius of the American boy and
scholar developed within its walls and
impressed upon the graduates that
through life they should t>ear as their
motto, "A fair field and no favor," for
that was all that the American boy ever
asked from opponents whether .on the.
field of games or' in study or in battle.
-The Rev.. Mr. Weedon delivered a most
impressive Â¦' and eloquent v address- to ; the
graduates 'as did BlshopTelect Rostarick.
Mr. , Weedon won a burst .of applause
when he said in the course f of -his re-
I marks; . that, â¢ while .upholding . and giving
the highest praise -to the â¢: public -school
system of the country,- he , regretted that
in the Â» public schools theyidid not touch
the character' of the pupil 'nor the emo
tions' nor. did -they direct 'aspirations.
They did not touch the real man nor
woman hood in the child. -They, did not
teach that great essential to the future
of the childâ How to live. On the con
trary with Trinity School they were
taught "howt/to live" and -.the great
and glorious principles of manhood. *

tled, so far as trouble at this point is con
cerned, but It Is hardly" probable that the
men will go to work again for some time.
It looks now as though the entire shop
force will walk out in sympathy with the
workmen at Needles. The Needles men
are now awaiting a reply from headquar
ters to their demand for an increase in
wages. All of the demands of the local
strikers have been acceded to/including
the reinstatement of Boilermaker Wilson,
whose dismissal caused the trouble.

Scott has â¢ been ' second lieutenant of
Company C two years and has been a
very popular :. officer. He was first ser
geant with the company while it was sta
tioned at Benlcia during the Spanish-
American war. He. is the only logical can
didate for. the office ;of first lieutenant at
the election: to be; held -next week and
therefore feels., keenly the defeat of his
company and especially the fact that it Is
attributed. to him. :
After church that night, while Scott and
several other: officers, with a crowd of pri
vates, were . in a; saloon,^ the private who
had created the trouble entered, and with
very little preliminary talk struck \. the
lieutenant. . ; The latter kept his temper
and ordered the fellow under arrest. Later
he remanded this order and gave the pri
vate a lecture in as severe terms as he
could muster. The. affair had something
of the nature of a barroom quarrel in it
and It was this that first put Scott and his
company into disgrace with the priz-eV
committee. â¢ Â¦.â¢;'..Â¦â¢: Â¦/ . ~
' FRESNO, May 28.â From further details
that" have come to light regarding the
trouble in the Sixth Regiment, National
Guard of 'California, over the awarding of
prizes at the recent encampment and the
accusations made by the awarding com
mittee against. Lieutenant W. S. Scott of
this city, it appears that these accusations
were the direct result of a quarrel be
tween Scott and a private, which took
place In- a saloon on a Sunday night.
While . Company C was drilling on the
morning of that day, a private got out of
position and was ordered into line by
Scott. His position was; less correct tMan
before and the order- was given again.
Scott finally took hold -of the man . and
.whirled him Into place. This was an un
military action on the part, of the lieuten
ant and was urged as one of the points
against Company C, by the committee'/*

of last week. The ceremony was per
formed by the Rev. Father Dempsey of

acted as matron of honor, while the
bride's brother was best man. After the
ceremony the couple and forty guests,
relatives and immediate friends, enjoyed

The ladles of the Forum Club enjoyed
their annual breakfast yesterday, which
closed the meetings of that organization
for the summer. Covers were laid for
175, each member who was able to be
present bringing one guest. The tables
were very pretty. Pink was the predom
inating color for decoration, roses and
sweet peas being lavishly arranged with
ferns. Mrs. \Payot, the club president,
presided and Mrs. Fritch was toastmis
tress. Among: the clever toasts given was
one by Mrs. - Fredericks, whose subject
was. "Man as a Charming Companion and
Friend. Mrs. Begensburger talked on
"To Be or Not to Be a Club Woman."
Miss Peck of New York, who was prom
inently identified with the biennial ' con
vention, offered bright and complimentary
remarks. .
HE members of the Deutscher
li Club and their ladles comprised a
I: brilliant assemblage last evening
â¢ 11 at the reception given in dedication
v of the new home of the club, at
123 Mason street. The decorations were a
profusion of La France roses, inter
s,persed with foliage. The musical pro
gramme was especially interesting, and
included 'cello selections beautifully ren
dered by Professor Mayer, accompanied
by W. * Yanke. George W. Bennett
rendered cornet solos, Iwhich were en
thusiastically received. Mrs. Ida Semi
nario, the gifted oratorio singer, was
among the guests and consented to sing
the popular aria from "Traviata" and
"Scenes That Are Brightest," which she
rendered with exquisite feeling. Later in
the evening Messrs. Stelndorf, Cashman
and Hartman of the Tivoll dropped in
and added a number of songs to the pro
gramme. The president, W. C.
Hildebrandt. made a few remarks of cor
dial welcome and encouraged the fur
ther success of the organization, which
Is the representative German club In this
city. The committee having the affair in
charge was composed of C. F. Thierbach,
W. B. Burner, Judge Bahrs, Colonel C.

The schooner Hatzic was 17 years old.
Ehe formerly the steam schooner
Dolphin, which sailed for Captain J. D.
Warren of this city. Then she became
the schooner Louis Olsen and one Will
iams, since deceased, took her south, lad
en with opium. She was seized and tak
en to San Francisco by San Francisco
customs officers.. Search was made for
the- opium without avail. The schooner
â¢was tied up at San Francisco for weeks'
and was almost torn to pieces in the ef
fort to find the opium, but the vessel was
finally released. It was learned lat^ that
the opium had been hidden in the sfiaft
tube which held the shaft when, the ves-
Fel was a steamer. It had been regu
lsrly blocked, but left hollbw, and *the
opium was encased inside.
Once an Opium Carrier.
Captain Daley was an old time sailor.
He brought the schooner Willie around
to Victoria from Cape Breton coast and
sailed in her until she was seized by
tlie Russian cruiser Kotick off the Copper
Inlands and her crew made prisoners of
Russia. They were jailed at Petropaulof-
Kki and suffered many indignities before
their release was procured. Captain Far
ley, the mate, was also a sealing echoon
er master, he having taken out the Hat
zic last spring.
Captain Daley was in command -with
Captain Patrick Farley as mate. Both
Â¦were married, the former having a fam
ily. Other white men in the crew were
A. Medina of Victoria, P. Dooley and
W. Christian. The cook was a Chinese
end there were twenty-four Kiyukot In
dians.
The Hatzic sailed from Victoria on
January 10 and shipped her Indian nunt
ert. *at Kiyukot, from which point she
sailed on February 15, two days before
the heavy gale in which the schooner
Fawn went ashore on Catallna Island.
Terrific gales blew on the 17th and the
Â£4th but most of the fleet weathered them
and started south. The Umbrina was
l<artially wrecked and returned leaking as
a result of the buffeting she received on
February 24. and the schooner R. L
Morse was wrecked in the gale of Feb
ruary 17, her crew being saved by the
Penelope. No one has since seen the
Hatzlc.
Storms Buffet Fleet.
The tug: Eagle, which made a trip
around the Scott islands northwest of
Vancouver Island â a group never visited
by any save prospectors' vesselsâ reports
hi-vir.g sighted the deck house of a
schooner on Triangle Island, and this
adds to the general belief that the Hat
zic has been lost. The majority of the
schooners which hunted ,olf the Van
couver Island coast have been home more
than three weeks, and none of the fleet
has evtr been later than May 27 in reach
ing port.
VICTORIA. B. C, May 28.â The sealing
echooner Hatzlc, Captain Daley, which
cleared from here on January - 10 last
with seven white men and twenty-four
Indians for a cruise in the Xorth Pa
c'fic, is missing and from the fact that
she was not spoken by any other of the
F.tet of twenty-eight schooners at any
time during the season there is little hope
that she is still afloat. The Hatzic .un
doubtedly foundered with all"Â»on board
during one of the heavy gales of the
winter â probably during the storm of
February 24, for the schooner Favorite
reports having sighted a schooner on
that day off the Vancouver Island coast,
heading in shore before the terrific gale.
ThÂ« Favorite with double reefed sails,
Â¦was running before the wind, and-it was
with the greatest difficulty that â¢ the
schooner rounded Cape Cook.

that beyond notifying the authorities at
Port Townsend on January 15, 1901, -that
the, Flottbek was in distress. -It is also
contended th*t. before the tugboats Wan

the gule 'had subsided and the Flottbek'
was irnio danger whatever and could eas

sistance. The further claim is made that
the towago service rendered was not
worth more than $600. The value of the
Flottbek was admitted to be $60,000 and
the salvage awarded is alleged to be more
than 38 per cent of the value of the salved
property, an unprecedentedly high propor
tion. The appellant admits that the dam

A treaty has at last been signed by Chile and the

That the Tewards of private business are drawing
the master intellects of the country away from a de- .
sire for a Congressional career is quite true, and it is
good for the country that it should be so. The wel
fare r of the people depends more upon work and
wages than upon talk, more uponi enterprise and
business' than upon the average legislation that occu
pies' the time of Congress. It iis well for the country
therefore that , politics .does' not absorb , : all the brains
of the* country. .The salaries now paid are high enough

Washington in the expectation that, he would
achieve,'a national, reputation as a statesman and be
come a noted leader' of his party. The experience of
two or more, terms, has shown them the folly of
their expectations. They are big enough men at
home and have a goodly following, but at.Washing
ton' they count for little. A Congressional career,
they perceive, has no glory for them, and so they
decide to leave, it. â¢ .. .
The ' Washington correspondent of the St. Paul
Globe Recently gave a list of Representatives who
will not be candidates for re-election. and gave the
smallhess of the salary as a reason for retiring.; Sev
eral of the lot have been in Congress for two or
more terms and have had ample experience upon
which to base their judgments.
SOME time ago attention was. directed to a
statement of one of the advocates of in
creased pay for members - of Congress that
there is not a man of any influence in either House
who could not make more money in some line of
business than his Congressional salary . amounts to.
The statement was not a valid argument for an in
crease of pay, for the Government does' not under
take to compete with private business in" the way of
monetary rewards. Still it seems that a considerable
number of Congressmen have made up their minds
to retire at the end of their present term on the
score that there is not money enough in it.
It is hardly ', necessary to point out the evils that
would result from such a surrender of the right of
home rule. A commission clothed with s,uch .' vast
powers and working with the giant corporations for
the corruption of the Legislature would be an
abomination from first to last and the people-would
be powerless. So far, indeed, as suppressing local
self : government is concerned, the amendment would
be a flawless cinch. -
It will be seen that this takes away the right " of
local self-government so far as the regulation of any
kind of corporation is concerned. Municipal gov?
ernments would^thus be deprived of one of their
most important functions. The- corporations that
controlled the commission could do as they pleased.
The people would have not even a right of appeal to
the courts, for the amendment in express terms gives
the commission exclusive power and jurisdiction.
After stating that the commission to ' be created
by the amendment and appointed in the first instance
by Gage shall be the successor of the Bank Com
mission and the Insurance Commissioner, the
amendment goes on to say: "The State commis
sion shall in every respect, so far as relates to all and
every the said rates and charges hereinbefore men
tioned, and to all and every the matter and things,
howsoever connected with performing said services
and furnishing and supplying said commodities, be
the successor under the constitution and laws of the
State of the Boards of Supervisors and city and
county or city and town councils and other govern
ing body or bodies of the several counties, cities and
counties, "cities and towns of the State, with the same
powers, authority and duties now established by the
constitution of the State and the laws of 'the State,
or hereafter to be established by the Legislature,
except where the latter may conflict with this sec
tion." â¢ '
ASSEMBLY constitutional amendment No.
28, which Gage and the corporations are try
ing to fasten upon the fundamental law of
California, is especially objectionable by reason of
the fact that if adopted it will suppress every vestige
of local control over public utilities, including even
such necessary* matters as water and light.

CINCHING THE PEOPLE.
CONGRESSIONAL SALARIES.
THE BANKERS MEET.
The great fault in our financial system was that up
to the passage of the gold standard law it was all the
result of emergency legislation, which is always
hasty, ill-considered ir.d imperfect. From 1862 until
1000 every line of financial legislation had borne the
marks of hasty indigestion of the subject by Con
gress. If what remains to be done is left until we
get in another panic it will be a botch of patchwork.
Therefore let the bankers say that it must be done
uow, when the times pipe of peace and plenty.
The time to strengthen our financial system and
give greater adequacy to our currency issues is
now, while the country is prosperous and there is
no emergency upon us.
communicate the same to Congress, for whatever
they recommend will be highly considered by the ex
perts and doctrinairÂ£s who are trying to push this
legislation to success.
The association will find that its labors in behalf
of scientific finance arc by no means over. The gold
standard law needs the support of additional legisla
tion that will make every dollar of all forms of cur
rency interchangeable with gold, and the currency
needs of the people require that greater flexibility be
given to cur national bank issues. The latter may
be accomplished by the bill recommended by the
Banking and Currency Committee of the House. It
ought to pass before this session of Congress ad
journs, and the California bankers will do -weir to
discuss it and recommend its passage if it be' ap
proved by their judgment. If they have amendments
or a substitute to propose they should not hesitate-to
THE California Bankers' Association will be in
session this week at San Jose. This associa

We will withhold our reserve mass of facts and evidence for the present, with the
assurance to our readers that the half has not been told. When it 1 is all before the public,
men will revolt. against sending criminals to San Quentin to be made Kvorse by the bad
example set them in the management of the prison. .','.'*
It is our duty to urge President Fitzgerald to do his, and go ahead at once with the
investigation. This is no less due the Governor and the Warden. If the offenses we will
prove have been without their connivance, if they are the victims of misplaced confidence,
they should be cleansed and acquitted of direct guilt immediately.
We want the investigation now. There is no good reason for delay. It may easily
mean the concealment, sophistication or destruction of the records and evidence.
.President Fitzgerald says: "Director Ray is at present in Sonora, Mexico, and can
not be back untilthe 6th of June. I cannot do anything until after that date."
Why not? The absence of one Director will 'not affect the facts. It will not change an
entry on the books, nor purge a false bill of forgery, nor change the identity, of articles
made in.the prison for private account at public expense. But we wish to remind Presi
dent Fitzgerald that he is a public officer. Changed and forged bills have.'been passed un
der his nose without detection. : Goods unlawfully made at the prison have been shippied
but before his face. The air of the place has reeked with cunning corruption, and he has
moved in it ignorant of the spoliation and crimes that grew around him as thick as: skunk
cabbage in an Indiana swamp.
. To investigate conditions which we have exposed .is to investigate also himself and
his Board of Directors. Have they anything that requires delay to conceal? Let<him and
them beware of making it appear that they have, for we warn him that the books may be
burned and their ashes given to the wind, the prison itself may be given to. the torch with
all inside its walls, and yet our evidence will exist to confront the guilty. Therefore it is
just as well not to wait for the uncertain return of Mr. Ray from Sonora. He may never
come back. . " . .;.
The people of California. are liberal to their public servants; they are willing to
build and furnish for the Governor a house at Sacramento/ but they are not willing to fur
nish him a house in Los Angeles and a residence in San Quentin, and by_convict
labor at that. . .
We have no political nor personal motive against the Governor, the Warden or any
body else, in making this exposure and demanding an immediate and searching investiga-
The Call is prepared to prove every charge it has made. They are all the result of
a searching investigation we were moved to make by the- denial of access to the books
demanded by the president of the Board of Directors. We have in hand proofs greatly in
excess of what we have published. The flagrant 2nd sustained violations of the law at
San Quentin far outrun what we have already exposed. The law permits only the manu
facture of jute sacks at San Quentin as the sole prison industry. Under Warden.. Aguirre
other manufactures have been carried on there., using raw material paid for by Â£he State,
to be made up for private account, without repaying the State for the material. Even if
this repayment were made the transaction would be in violation of law. All this we. are pre
pared to show and prove, together with an elaborate system of forgery and criminal
bookkeeping to cover it up.
should be present." v l~ . \
â¢^ This statement by Mr. Fitzgerald is disingenuous./ The Call did not demand to see
the books. President Fitzgerald demanded,' by a written order, that we see the books, and
his demand, officially made, was refused. That refusal was a fatal mistake for the Warden.
It roused a train of suspicions that had not previously existed. How did he know we
sought personal information to use F.gainst him? Not a word about the prison. had up to
that time appeared in The Call. . If the books contained nothing that could be used
against him, what harm could come by obeying the order of the president to show them?
Our looking at them could neither give^ npr take Vaway an entry Â¦.-nor. change a figure. :
President Fitzgerald only involves Â¦ himself further by adding :\ "A State official
ought to have some .time '-to meet people :cofrectiy when he is charged with such a .grave
crime." Â¦ But the Warden ;had:not^been charged with anything. President Fitzgerald had
not given TheCall an- order; to meet^Warderi Aguirre, but one to see the books.;. The
books were not accused; of any grave crime for "preparation. They
were written prepare , to meet people? Did he
wish : timeto-changeentries r conceal books and destroy records^ The issue turns not upon
his state iof mind nor His physical condition. These may change daily. It turns upon the
story told in the books and bills and records of the prison, which do not change of their
own accord and should not be changed, even to prepare, the Warden to meet peo
ple correctly.
It was a suspicious circumstance that access to the prison records, which are pub
lic documents, was denied to us. The representative of this paper had an order from Presi
dent Fitzgerald, of the Prison Directors, for access to the books. Such an order "should
not be necessary to secure to any citizen the right to see the books. Thatright belongs to
every one. But it was denied even when backed by an order from the president.
President Fitzgerald says now: "Mr. Aguirre admits that when The Call men
called at the prison several days ago demanding to see the books, they were refused, but
this was on the- ground that Aguirre knew that they were looking for personal infor
mation to use against him, and he thought if an investigation was going to be made he

PLENTY OP WATER.
"I have been, working on this plan for
supplying the city with power for over
two years," said Major McLaughlln yes
terday. "At last the company- has been
formed, the papers have been filed and I
am glad to tell the general public what a
grand project it is. We are totally Indif
ferent about the rainfall or the amount of
snow that Is in the mountains. We shall
always have water and we shall be under
no expense of building and watching
flumes and ditches. The work will be
completed and the company operating iu
about a. year." . Â¦Â¦ Â¦
At the present time all the power that is
generated in this State is brought from
the mountains and hills by flumes and
ditches. The Feather River Power Com
pany will not be handicapped in this mat
ter. It will have no flumes to keep in re
pair or ditches to be' carefully watched.
The great volume of water It will use will
simply rush through the tunnels and di
rect to the powerhouse. The company will
sign Contracts for irrigation rights in the
locality, as there will be no water con
sumed in the generation of power.
.The company* has decided that it will
only furnish power in San Francisco. The
route chosen for transmitting- the power
to this city will be through many towns.
Including San Jose, but the wires will not
be tapped along the route. Major â¢ Mc-
Laughlin, speaking of the company yes
terday, said that it 'wag estimated that
the cost of the plant would be $2,00j),000.
At the present time 85,000 horsepower i:
landed in this city from different points Jr
California and this supply is sadly inade
quate. With the 20,000 horsepower . thai
the new company will, furnish there wil
still be a great demand for power that if
will be impossible to supply. : . . Â¦
Work will be commenced at once to tun
nel from the terminus of the Big Benc
tunnel, which is two miles In â¢ length
through a small mountain to the Feathe:
River, half a mile distant. When this is
completed and the water rushes down the
steep canyon, the officers of the Company
feel assured that they will easily generate
40,000 horsepower. . -
GREAT DEMAND FOR POWER
Within the last -few days the new com
pany has purchased from the Big Bern
Tunnel and Mining Company of Buffalo
N. Y., all the properties of the Big Bent
tunnel, its United States patent rights or
the Feather River, which extend for four
teen miles, and which* were granted ir
1881. and some 4000 acres of land.
All the officers of the company are Ioca
men of great wealth. The president of th>
company ia Charles Webb.. Howard
Charle^ I* Fair is the vice president, an<
the directors are J. Downey Harvey, W
J. Dingee anil Major Frank McLaughlin
The capital stock of the company is $5,
000,000. . . â¢
The corporation will be known as thi
Feather - River Power Company. Th<
properties are located at the Big Bend o
the Feather River, twenty miles f ron
Oroville, and within one year the com
pany will furnish 20,000 horsepower in Sar
Francisco.
After two years of negotiations the mos
extensive power company In Calif ornlf
has been formed. Final details were set'
tied and papers of incorporation were flle<
yesterday. Â¦
The evening session of the Board of
Supervisors, sitting as a committee of the
whole, to hear suggestions regarding the
budget for the next fiscal year, was en
tirely consumed by the Board of Public
Works. Leon Park, secretary of the
board, appeared before the committee to
ask for all manners of increase in the
amount of money apportioned . to the
Board of Works. Whether or not they
succeed In impressing the Supervisors
with the urgency of their needs remains
to be seen, as the board merely sat last
night to hear evidence, which will be con
sidered later when the budget is finally
made out. .
One of the principal Items considered
wa? In regard to the salary which the
architect should receive. During the next
year, if the plans of the Supervisors are
carried out, many new schoolhousea and
a new City and County Hospital will be
constructed. The board discussed whether
it would be more advisable to allow $4000
for the architect's salary and thus secure
a capable man for the position, who would
be able to plan the new structures, or
whether to allow only $3000 and to hire an
additional architect to furnish ,the plans.
The. Supervisors showed a, disposition to
'increase the pay of jar.Uors, elevator men
and laborers to $2 75 a day. The board
will continue Its session at 2:30 this after
â¢ noon. ,
ASKS FOR MORE MONEY.
ed $250 of the $2500 appropriated for
municipal reports to print the Civil Ser
.vice Commissioner's report. Moran also
asked that the salary of the clerk of the
commission be raised.
â¢ Sadie E. Clark, who is suing Fred Â¦ W.
Clark for divorce, is; according to the tes
timony given by her husband in Judge
Hunt's court yesterday, unfit to be his
wife, but is a very proper person 'to care
for their, child, aged two years. Clark in
describing his wife branded her as a wo
man of most dissolute habits,, and then
calmly informed the court that he was
satisfied to have her bring up their child."
"Well," said Judge Hunt, "you are a
most remarkable man. ~You deliberately
blacken the character' of your wife by
saying she is a drunkard and that she is
a woman of very low habits, and then
sty you are willing that she should care
for your child. I'll reserve my opinion
until I can see Mrs.-; Clark. This matter
will go. over until next Tuesday."
Annie Ingham, wife of tollce Officer
Richard I. Ingham commenced an action
for divorce yesterday, alleging that Ing
bam has frequently abused her. She
charges him with Intemperance. They
were married in May, 1890, and have two
children. f
Almat Steigelmeier is suing Albert
Steigelmeier for divorce for cruelty, al
leging that he has beaten, choken and
abused her ever since their marriage in
1S92. John Milton Evans, who keeps a
saloon and lodging house at 116 Eddy
street, is being sued for divorce by Eliz
abeth Evans. She charges that he has
been unfaithful to her and has failed to
provide for her. .
A suit for divorce was commenced yes
terday by James A. Dlnienne against
Florence Dinienne. He alleges that sho
deserted him two years after ,their mar
riage at Oakland in 1899.
Divorces were granted yesterday to Al
fred A. Marlatt from Virginia A.
Marlatt for cruelty, Alba H.
Dickinson, from. W. A". Dickinson for
failure to provide, Robert J. Munn from
Barbara Munn for desertion, Abraham
Heineman from Mae B. Heineman for de
sertion and Ella Savlcle from Louis
Savicle for cruelty.
Â¦ Expert Williams of the Finance Com
mittee prepared a statement showing that
there are now 3100 saloons, paying a li
cense of $84 per annum each, making a
total of $260,400. The increase to 1200
would reduce -the number of saloons to
about 3000, Insuring a revenue of $600 000
or an increase of $339,600. There are now
about 1000 nickel-in-the-slot machines pay
ing $40 per year, or a total of $40,000 If
the license were increased to $120 per year
the revenue therefrom would be $90,000. as
suming that the increase license would re
sult in a decrease to 750 machines
â¢ School Director Woodward explained
that plans for building new schoolhouses
had been prepared which would eat ud a
surplus of some $135,900 32 in the school
fund as returned by the State Controller
The sum of $25,000 had been contracted for
cost $45,000. Woodward was piled with
questions to learn what the board intend
ed to do with the remainder of the sur
plus, but the Director would give no di
rect answer, claiming he was not aware
of such a surplus A statement furnished
by the State Controller showed the fol
lowing figures: â¢ .

Instead of ?3500 for stationery for the
Assessor's office, including fifty-four new

"The money need not come from the
taxpaytrs," said Wittman. "If you can
not see your way to increase the liquor
license, why not raise the license on
nickel-in-the-slot machines to $120 per
year, and I will give you the best police
department In the world? I will give you
607 patrolmen, which will insure eight
hour watches and better protection for all
districts. Last year there was a carnival
of crime in this city, which will be re
peated next year. This Is a dumping
ground for the criminal element in the
winter time. There Is no captain in the
district west of Larkin street to the
ocean. We ought to have one more cap
tain, six additional lieutenants and 600
patrolmen, instead of 531 as provided for
There are now twenty-six men on the
civil service eligible list of policemen and
another examination will shortly be held."
REVENUES FROM LICENSES.
Chief of Police Wittman said that if the
board would give the Police Department
$100,000, in addition 'to the $838,084, he would
be satisfied. / '
Registrar Walsh said that two special
elections for a bond issue and charter
amendments held after the next general
election In November would cost $7500
each and the bond election to be held next
spring would cost $20,000. Walsh asked
for $155,000 instead of $133,000, which al
if.ady included provision for one , bond
election.
COST OF ELECTIONS.
Braunhart asked Watt If the item of
$45,000 for a new firehouse and site in
the boarding-house district could not be
eliminated in view of the fact, that a
bond issue; is proposed for the purchase
of iirt houses.
"The enormous Increase in the number
of large frame building in the district
near Bush and Jones streets is jeopard
ising the safety of the city," said Watt.
"I would ask this board not to remove
the restrictions of the building laws in
granting permits to erect houses. I
would hardly approve of a plan to build
a temporary fire engine house to give
protection to the district, but it is impos
sible to rent a suitable place for the
purpose."
Treasurer McDougald pleaded for an
appropriation to pay the premiums on
official bonds of city officers. McDougald
said that he paid $500 yearly for a bond
of $100,000 ,to the surety companies, who
had formed a trust to mulct city offi
cials* His office deputies paid $450 addi
tional as premiums and McDougald held
that it was an injustice to infringe on
the salaries of city employes. Deputy
Merton C. Allen stated that the surety
trust exacts a bond of $195,000 from the
Treasurer's office, or $95,000 in excess of
what the charter requires. Allen said
the surety companies arfe interfering
in the conduct of municipal affairs and
attempting to control affairs in city of
iices besides exacting bonds from subor
dinate employes who are not in responsi
ble positions. The amount needed to pay
the premiums on all official bonds would
be $4800 and the commissions on collateral
inheritance taxes would more than pay
the expense, Allen said.
WANTS NEW FIBEHOUSE.
Fire Commissioner Watt said the Fire
Department could get along without new
apparatus, but if the board found that
after readjusting the budget it could
spare funds for a new engine or two and
to set more hydrants tne commission
would be satisfied. ,
'.'We ask for enough money," said
Watt, "to fill up the companies according
to the charter requirement. The firemen
are compelled to live in the firehouses,
which are in some cases uninhabitable.
AVt: would like to give the men one day
ofl! in ten. To fill the companies up will
require $26,400 in addition to the $403,830
recommended. We need an extra painter,
an extra machinist and two more
hostlers, or $2640 more.
Coroner Leland pleaded that provision
bo made for permanent improvements in
the nature ot modern appliances for the
proper handling of dead oodles. Leland's
requests were in addition to the allow
ance ot $20,Â»40 for the maintenance of his
omce as recommended by the committee.
Chief Hewitt of the Department of Elec
tricity said that the sum of $161,(XH), In
stead of f'JO.OOO, should be provided for the
department. The sum of $25,000 would be
collected in fees next year, which Hewitt
thought should be credited to his depart
ment. Fire Commissioner Watt said that
the training of the wires to the new cen
tral fire alarm and police telegraph star
tion in the City Hall courtyard would
cost considerable. The board has allowed
$7500 tor the building, but it will merely
house the apparatus, and $7500 additional
id necessary, Watt said.
Recorder Godchaux said it would re
quire $28,b00 to pay his copyists, or $2800
more than the Finance Committee allows.
This amount is- necessary because the
copyists were doing Jluo worth of work
per month yet received only $73 on ac
count of an insufficient appropriation,
Godchaux said.
CORONER STATES NEEDS.
"We acknowledge," said Brandenstein,
"that the budget contains- errors, and we
welcome any suggestions that may be
made."
When the board convened Brandenstein
said that it was not expected by the Fin
ance Committee that tne budget it had
recommended should be adopted as iinal
by. the board.
A number of city officials appeared yes
torday before the ! Board of Supervisors
sitting as a committee - of the whole to
consider next year's tax^ budget, for the
purpose of Inducing, the city fathers to
make increased appropriations for their
several departments over those recom
mended by the Finance Committee. V
# Previous to the meeting a conference of
the Supervisors -was held In the,commit
tee-room to discuss the advisability of
raising the retail liquor license to $200 per
year. Several of the Supervisors, includ
ing Connor and Wilson, urged that the
license be raised in order to provide ad
ditional revenue for the Police Depart
ment. A majority of the board, however,
was unalterably opposed to the plan, and
it isr-doubtful whether any move will be
made in that direction.' Â¦
Attorney Short will argue the case for
the plaintiff this morning and will be
followed by J. E. Foulds and former
Judge Garber for the railroad. Attorney
General Ford will make the concluding
argument for the people.
The case first came up in May,. 1900,
oeiore Judge Bahrs and was stiiirhiuea
on an agreed statement of' tacts. ;j udg*
Bsthrs held at that time that the-.Rail
road Commissioners had a right to ehr
join the company from- reverting to the
higher rate. This decision was later re
versed by the Supreme Court.
The Southern .Pacific claims that the
rate of .$3 75 was not a competitive rate to
meet the opposition of the San Joaquin
\ alley road when it went Into operation,
but was a special rate made to aid in
the booming of, the valley.
Attorney General Tirey I* Ford, Dep
uty Attorney General George A. Sturte
vant Frank H. Short of Fresno ap
peared for the plaintiffs. The attorneys
for the Southern Pacific Company were
J. E. Foufds and former Judge Garber,
who has been retained as special counsel.
John Moss, assistant general freight
and passenger agent of the San Fran
.cisco and San Joaquin Valley road, tes
tified to the opening of the fcsan Joaquin
Valley line In January, 1S97.
James Horsburgh Jr., assistant general
passenger agent of the Southern Pacific
Company, was the next witness He
testified that the $3 75 rate was bj' no
means intended as a cut to meet ' the
rates of the San Joaquin Valley road, but
was a special rate for those that chose
to take advantage of it. The $3 75 ticket,
he said, did not permit passengers' to get
off at way stations between San Francis
co and Fresno and required that all bag
gage be checked through between those
points. The $5 90 ticket, he added, re
mained in force with stop-over advan
tages and privileges.
The testimony of W. S. Mattingley and
John C. Moore, given at the former trial
of the case, was read and admitted in
evidenpe by consent of counsel.
Their testimony was to the effect that
they had always paid $3 75 for their tick
ets between "Fresno and San Francisco.
The testimony of S. F. Booth, ticket
agent at Fresno, was next read. Booth
testified that he knew nearly every ono
traveling from Fresno to San Francisco
and sold them the 53 75 tickets. He said
they could have had the $5 90 ticket for
the asking.
C. R. Preek, baggage agent of the
Southern Pacific Company, testified that
the regulations printed on the $3 75
tickets, regarding the checking of -bag
gage through from point to point, had
always been adhered to by him. The
testimony of Preek concluded the taking
of evidence.
The suit of the Railroad Commission
ers versus the Southern Pacific Company
or, as it is better known, Bdson vs. the
Southern Pacific Company, came up yes

Because a Judge of the Superior Court
erred in admitting certain evidence, there
is a possibility that John Nichols may
lose $12,000 ' which was awarded him in a
suit Â¦ brought against A. W. Randall-.
Nichols loaned Randall $35,000 in 18S3. In
1897 there was a difference of. a trifle
more than $58,000 in the. accounts kept by
the litigants of this transaction. Nichols
secured a judgment for a portion of what
he claimed was due him in the lower
court, but the Supreme Court .orders a
new trial.
Much enthusiasm prevails among the
friends of the enterprise. The stock of
the company after June 1 will be sold at
$2 50 per share. The model can be seen at
37 Suiter street^San Francisco. - .

tit the Knights of Pythias. Patton aeked the
board to illuminate the Ferry building, during
the conclave, in Honor of the visitors. The
Commissioners discussed the expense and sug-
Beited that the Knights and Shrincrs. who will
come later, might divide the expense and by
contributing fTOO assist- the Commissioners In
carrying out the plan of illumination. ThÂ»
board opened bids for the permanent wiring of
the building, but no action was taken, ae the
bios were too high. .....
Major Duvol. general superintendent of the
general army transport wharf, asked permis
eioii to build a warehouse on Folsom-street
wharf. The request was taken under consid
eration.
Permission was granted the Pacific Horticul
tural Society to hold a flower show in the nave
of the Ferry building on August 14. 15 and 16.
Lot D. Norton, chief engineer of the Har
bor Commission, appealed to the members of
the board yesterday for more time In which
to file his report of the work done by certain
contractor*. A week ago The Call exposed the
methods employed by the contractors, and the
Harbor Commissioners directed it{ chief engi
neer to investigate. When the matter came
up during the meeting. Norton asked for more
time. This was granted. After the cession
Norton stated it would take him two weeks
to examine the work done by the contractors.
He said other wharves are to be built and he
intends paying particular attention to the work
dene.
Norton Asks for More Time.
The British ships Lydgate and Montgomery

securely. Before the engines could be stopped
the log had stripped the wheel clear of blades.
The rattling and rasping- that accompanied the
work of destruction caused a panic among the
passengers, and for a while pandemonium
reigned on the forry-boat. The disabled wheel
wao disconnected and the TamalpalB proceeded
on her Journey with only ope wing working.
It will take several days to repair the damage.
- CABLEGRAM received yester-
J\ day at the Merchants' Exchange
Zj\ from London sets at rest all ru-
Aj\ mors of a job by unscrupulous
speculators in the matter of the
British ship Red Rock, which arrived the
other day at Falmouth. The Red Rock
did actually jettison part of her cargo.
According to the dispatch received yester
day she threw overboard 100 tons of sal-
m Th'e- Red Rock left the Fraser River in
thf storm that wreckefi the Matteawan
and sent' to the bottom the British gun
boat Condor. A few weeks after her de
parture a life buoy bearing the name Ren
Rock and several cases of salmon marked
similarly to that vrith which the Britisher
was loaded were picked up on a northern
beach. The - Red Rock was promptly
placed on the reinsurance list, where she
figured at varying rates until she was
spoken well on toward her journey's end.
The British ship Ardnamurchan, which
left Fraser River a year or so before the
Red Rock sailed, lost overboard some of
her salmon. This salmon was found and
th" ATdnamrrchan was placed on the re
insured list. This coincidence of the un
usual gave rise to a suspicion that the
Red Rock salmon migrht have been found
or planted by unscrupulous speculators
who took their cue from the Ardnamur
chan incident. The existence of this sus
picion tended to keep down the Red Rock
rate. Now that the report of the Red
Rock's voyage establishes the authen
ticity of the salmon's find the legitimate
speculators in reinsurance breathe easier
and the cloud of suspicion has been com
pletely dissipated.

and paid him the $259 and took an un
dated receipt for the money. This ruse
practically ties the hands of Evans, the
prosecuting witness, and also that of the
District Attorney, ajs it will be hard to
convince a jury that Evans did not re
ouest Conway to draw out the money and
receive it from him en the day he drew It
out.
â¢ Before the men were charged. Attorney
A rente Campbell sued out a writ of
habeas corpus for their release. It was
made returnable forthwith before Su
perior Judge Lawlor, but as Judge Lawlor
did not hold court yesterday afternoon,
ttt matter was not taken ud. In the
meantime Oon^tay and - Lyons were re
leased on 1500 cash ball.' When the war
rants were cworn out Judee Cabanlsa
originally fixed the bail at $1000 in each
raee, but upon the showinsr made by At
torney Campbell it waa reduced.
Deputy County Clerk Lyons, who drew
the mor.ey out of the treasury upon the
order given him by Conway, denies all
knowledge of the matter. He made a full
statement to Captain Seymour yesterday,
in which he claimed that he knew nothing
of Conway'? methods and never used atoy
of the money drawn out of. the treasury
on fraudulent orders. He stated further
that when Conway presented the order to
him and asked him to cash it he did not
have the slightest suspicion that anything
was wrong. He went into the Treasurer's
office for the money and received it in
sight of Policeman Rainsbury, who Is de
tailed there.
It is a strange fact about this case that
Jessie Holland was at liberty without bail
from March 22, the day she was held to
answer in Judge Mogan's court, until last
Tuesday, when she was convicted of
grand larceny in the Superior Court.
LYONS MAKES EXPLANATIONS.
This sort of negligence on the part of a
Police Judge gives the Police Court clerk
an opportunity to draw on the treasury
as he would on his own private bank ac
count, except, of course, he must be able
to raise, (from private sources the money
he dra'ws in this way so when the case is
di&posed of it may be on hand ready- Tor
tbe person who originally deposited it. If
Evans had not. accidentally -received an
order from Judge Dunne for the return of
the bail money when the case of
Jesse Holland v.-as disposed of in
bis ' court Tuesday the loose sys
tem that permits Police Court clerks
to secure and use bail money at
will might never have been exposed.
If Evans had presented himself to Con
way and asked for an order for his bail
rconey, as is the usual custom, the Police
Court clerk would have probablv taken
his receipt and told him to come back in
an hour, and in the meantime he could
either have drawn another fraudulent or
der for that amount in some case still
pending or secured the money to make
â¢â¢good" the demand on the outside. And
fo the system is a case of borrowing from
Peter to pay Paul. Just how much of
this has been done is not known, but It is
ecfe to say that the practice. Is quite
common. . â¢
THE WAY IT IS 'DONE.
The expose of the latest Police Court
method of getting possession of bail
snoney has aroused the ire of Treasurer
McDougald, and he yesterday issued or
ders that in the future no bail money will
be refunded until the party calling for it
presents the original receipt -he received
from the Warrant and Bond Clerk, a duty
which every Judge of the Police Court is
supposed to look after when he signs or
ders for the return of bail money.
The method of securing bail money in
the manner that Conway did is very sim
ple, but it is quite doubtful that either
Lyons or Conway can be convicted in
this case. When a person puts up bail
for the appearance in the Police Court of
a defendant charged with crime he takes
a receipt from the warrant and bend
clerk, with whom the money is first de
posited. When the case is disposed of in
the Police Court the person who put up
the bail takes his receipt to the clerk of
the Police Court and he takes the receipt
end makes an order for the return of the
bail. This order is signed by the Judge
of the court in which the case was tried,
and the person who put up the bail pre
sents it to the city treasury and receives
his money. The system is such that un
less the Police Judges inspect every or
der carefully and take charge- of the re
ceipts themselves the clerk of the Police
Court, if the Judge allows him to hand vp
a bunch of orders for the return of ball
money and have them signed indiscrim
inately, can draw as much ball money
from the treasury for his own private use
as he sees fit.
LOOSE METHODS.
Fredrick R. Conway, clerk in Depart
ment 1 of the Police Court, presided over
by Judge Mogan, and Robert E. Lyons,
13eputy County Clerk, who were taken
into custody Tuesday night upon the ex
pose of their- allegea fraudulent methods
*jf securing ball money from the city
treasury, were yesterday booked at the
City Prison on charges of grand larceny
by trick and device. This charge was
placed against the two clerks after a con
sultation held yesterday afternoon in the
District Attorney's office. J. M. Evans,
the saloon proprietor whose money was
extracted from the treasury upon the or
der executed by Polioe Court Clerk Con
way and signed by Judge Mogan. by mis
take, so ii is claiinea. appeared at the
Hall of Justice about 3 oeiooc yesterday
afternoon ana swore to the complaints
<;ha.rging Conway and Lyons witn grand
larceny. There was considerable quib
iing over the exact nature of the charge
that should be lodged against the men,
but Assistant District Attorney John T.
Graney, after looking into tne matter
thoroughly, decided that grand larceny by
trick and device was the proper change, it
being argued that the money was ,the
property of Evans, and that the [Treas
urer was simply the custodian vi the
coin.
1 The penalty for securing money from
Vhe city treasury by fraudulent orders is
exactly the same as that which will be
"meted out if Lyons and Conway are con
victed upon the grand larceny charge.

jftression of the traders as to the volume of con
tracts existing with them or on the other side.
-^Bt*Â» decline of the preceding days found the
%-tlere generally committed in a small way
tff the short side, and they attempted to cover
their ehort contracts before the rival traders
could do so. The fact that the rise of some
thing over a point Ja Reading was accom
panied by rumors that developments were Im
pending, encouraging a hope of the settlement
of the coal strike, was of very light weight,
and many Wall street officers had dispatches
from the rr.:ni:.gr region reporting the prospects
unchanged without affecting the small work
that was In progress. The buying of St. Paul
was Just as little accepted as indicating any
Importance in the progress of the crops, al
though the weather map was favorable and
the sharp reaction In the grain markets offered
some corroboration. Until definite news is
known of the damage to the coming corn crop,
a large crop- will be taken for granted. There
was some demand for Â¦ the soft coal carriers
on the ground that the shortage of anthracite :
coal enhance? the demand for soft coal as a
eubstitute. There is the doubtful element also
of the possible success of the effort making to
get the bituminous coal miners to Join the an
thracite coal strikers. The 3*4 point rise in
Hocking Valley has as additional grounds the
report of a proposed increase in the dividend
rate. ' The speculative Realizing on Canadian
Fac.flc continued to-day and removed the stim

from the market. The feeling of disappoint

CHICAGO.May 28.â Weakness ruled in corn
from the opening 1 . The~ sharp advance here
yesterday influenced cash houses to j Increase
their bids in the field. Before noon advices
indicated 1,000,000 bushels sold to Chicago. In
the pit the cash houses that bought this stuff
at once sold and It forced prices down beyond
the low bulge of yesterday. Cables were un
responsive, crop reuorts were good and good
weather was reported In the corn belt. Early
in the sesElon the big bull houses unloaded
with some profits after the successful manipu
lation of yesterday. Alter prices plunged
downward there was some cash" business, but
it did not serve to steady the market. The
wheat weakness showed no signs of abatement
and July, which yesterday was worth t>4%c
and which opened to-day at 64c to 03%c, closed
weak, l>4<ai%c lower, at C2 T i<gÂ«3c.
Wheat showed some early weakness on the
early foreign weakness, which was based on
the favorable Government report received heri.
The Southwest was bearish on crop pros
r>ectÂ« and sold freely. There .were few
short accounts . cpen and consequently as
prices declined there was little to ar
iest the weakness. There was a heavy sell
ing trade, although a few commlfsion houses
bought. The weather was good everywhere for
crops. The cold weather scare was found to
amount to nothing go far, and although th>?
coolness was not a help to a fqreing erowth,
yet It had done no damage. As corn turned
very weak,' wheat was depressed still further
and the weakness it develODed saemed to be
so thoroughly saddled upon the market that,
even late reports of sixty-five loads sold at the
seaboard for exDOrt and four 'loads worked
here direct failed more than to steady the
Flump a trifle over the bottom figures. July
opened jie to -Tic up at 73%c to 73-7ic; slumpcl
to 72%Â©729ic and closed weak, l&c to 1 ,VjC- :
down at 72%@72%c.
â¢ â¢ TkerÂ« was little of Interest in oats. July
closed '/4c down at KTKjC.
Provisions were ' dull, after " showing fair
strength early in the day. The hog situation
was firm and early buying was fair. The
erain weakness, however, caused liquidation
and a loss of the early gains. Packers cUd not
support the market- late in the day. July pork
closed unchanged, lard a shade lower and
ribs unchanged.

The advance in Butter has already had the
anticipated effect of stopping packing, espe-'
daily in the country. From a speculative
standpoint the danger point has been reached
and dealers as a rule have written their ship
pers, both dairy and creamery, not to send in
any more cubes. The cost of storing; exclusive
of the cost of package, is about 2%c, which at,
say 21c, would bring: the -Butter out upon the
market in the. fall at 23%c. Packed Butter re
tail* to the public during the fall and winter
at 25c, so it will be seen that at present quota
tions the dealer who stores. is running a :risk
which few care to assume. If packing stops
now receipts will pVobably accumulate, in
which case a lower market would result.
There is no change in Cheese and Eggs. The
former is still weak and plentiful, while the
latter are firm, with* fine ranch in compara
tively light supply. There are plenty of me

The'case decided. was an appeal from a
judgment entered upon a demurrer to the
complaint filed by the depositors. The
demurrer is overruled and the suit must
now go on in . the regular way or be
dropped by the directors, which latter ac
tion Is quite possible In view of the opin
ion of the Supreme Court on the principal
pcint of the dispute.
As a result of a decision of the Supreme
Court rendered yesterday it is probable
that the board of directors of the defunct
Savings Bank of San Diego County Will
have to pay to depositors the sum. of
$127,570 25, which amount Is alleged to
have been misappropriated by Howard
and Mabury, two of the directors. It is
stated that the money was I wrongfully
applied in behalf of the Consolidated Sav
ings Bank. '
The point in dispute was whether the
constitutional law, which makes bank di
rectors liable for the embezzlements of
their officials, applied in the case at bar.
The Supreme Court holds that the funds
in question were used for an unauthorized
purpose and that the directors are really
as. responsible as if there had been a case
of. direct embezzlement.
priation of Funds Is Equivalent
to Embezzlement.

The Memorial day committee, desiring
to have a goodly supply of cut flowers for
decorating the graves of the nation's sol
diers, makes a second appeal to the pub
lic to leave flowers to-day at lower Met'

received by members of the "Women's Re
lief Corps, the Ladies of the Grand Army
and the Ladles' Auxiliary and the Veter

volunteered to prepare the flowers for
distribution. The increase in the number
of graves in the National Cemetery. Pre

much larger quantity of flowers 13 needed

ARGUE' FOR SETTLERS.
Messrs. Wood and Munday spoke on he
half of the settlers I whose homes are in
volved and who acquired rights under the
Government to .'the lands, they claim' by
virtue of settlements under the public
land laws made. at. various times from
1881 to the date of the patents 'involved
and whose applications or contests for the
respective tracts . claimed â¢ were ; actually
pending in due form and -undetermined
before the Land , Department when said
patents were- procured. The counsel ar
'gued that at the date of the second grant
the. Perham map furnished the only boun
daries to the .first -grant. The company
could not then r have been heard to deny
these boundaries- since it had furnished no
others, and cannotmow- be heard to dis
pute them, since it has not yet furnished
any different boundaries. â¢: Counsel said*
Counsel Â¦ ' for the c Government contend
that Congress,', by -its act- of July 2. 1864,
did = not , contemplate that the railroad
should Teach Portland by r a direct Una
from .Puget Sound f to Portland, , but .that
there 'should be" a branch" line 1 leaving the
main trunk-line at some suitable place,
not more than 300 miles from. Its western
terminus, commonly agreed to be; Wal
lula Junction,, In the State: of Washing
ton, and extending by way of the Colum
bia River to a point at or near Portland.
By joint resolution April 10, 1869,- the com
pany .was granted the privilege to estab
lish a branch line from a point at or near
Portland, Oregon, to some suitable" point
orÂ«. Puget Sound, to be determined -by
the company, and to connect . the same
with Its main line west of the. Cascade
Mountains. *â¢ It is conceded the
Northern Pacific never did construct or
operate any railroad at Wallula Junction,
via the valley of the Columbia RLver, to
a point at .or near 'Portland. Oregon."
It is- urged on the part of the Govern
ment that the, lower court erred in hold
ing that the grant had not been forfeited.
It is the contention of he Government
that the principle of the grant being "a
"float" cannot apply in this case. By rea
son of the topography of the country the
railroad line is definitely - located by the
terms of the act. Courts, it is argued,
must take judicial notice . of landmarks,
such as rivers, and the topography of. the
country. The company, it is claimed, has
willfully failed .to Â¦perform the conditions
of the grant of July 2, 1864.
BRANCH ROAD ' PROVISO.
The question Involved in the case is the
right of- the United States v to -certain
lands situated In the Western Division of
the District ' of Washington, commonly
denominated - as* "overlap^ -lands. The
suit was brought under direction of At
torney General McKenna July 24, 1897.

PUNISHMENT NOT SEVERE.
Miss Mary.Hoogs. a teacher, explained
the "punishment administered, to the Ra>r
gio boy. The lad's skin was protected by
ap. undergarment and twenty blows were
administered with a single rattan. Miss
Hoogs did not regard the punishment as
brutal and thought Raggio ' got what he
xnerited. â¢ â¢ â¢ : -
George A. Merrill, principal of the Cali
fornia School of Mechanical Arts, said, he
had known Blanchard for twenty-five
years and that he was a man of strict in-
Tegrity and fine educational qualifications.
Deputy Superintendents of Schools Hotv
erd\ Kingsbury and Sullivan and Principal
Morton of the Lowell High School gave
testimony favorable to Blanchard's work
ae a principal. . Â¦,"Â¦;' ,r.. :â¢*
Superintendent Webster was 'called to
the stand and declared that if Attorney
Latimer, who had retired from the case,
bad made the statement that he (Web
ster) had concealed any important infor
mation regarding Blanchard's case he had
told a falsehood. Webster said that as a
State officer he had not deemed it his
duty. -to lake part In the trial, and, bo-
Bides, the case might be referred to r him
for. adjudication. This latter statement
dunsfounded the Directors, and Mark said
that the law refers only to Boards of
Trustees. Webster replied that the point
must be settled by the Supreme Court. It
developed .that .Webster, had given some
documents in the case, including a dupli-
W \V. Sanderson. Blanchard's attor
ney probed deeply into the causes which
had impelled Miss Perry to be such a pro
ncunced witness against his clkmt. L-l
vard Cornu. aged 18 years, testt-ied that
after Miss Perry had left the Hancock
Grammar School he visited her at tne
Berkshire Hotel to teach her Spanish.
Cornu would ttien inform Miss Perry ot
the mischievous acts he had committed in
the classroom taught by Miss Perry s suc
cessor. The latter had told him to roll a
marble along the floor to annoy Miss
Peckham. and Cornu instead threw rocks
across the room, for which he was pun
ished by Blanchard. - *Â».
Miss Anita Lastreto, a teacher in the
Hancock School, testified that Miss Perry
had repeatedly said that -John Raggio.
â¢who was flogged by Blanchard, was a bad
boy. Miss Lastreto. said that she always
deemed it her duty to make changes in
the record. of corporal punishments if ad
vised to do so by her principal... *
Miss Peckham, who succeeded Miss Per
ry in the class, said that it was full of
lawless children, and sne was compelled
to take to her bed on the third day from
exhaustion. Miss Peckham tfiought that
the punishment admiiiistereoS to Raggio
Â¦rras not excessive. She remembered that
another boy who was punished returned
to his class and laughed over it. Miss
Peckham suggested to. Blanchard that as
the punishment had been too mild he
should repeat it more forcibly. The wit
nes admitted having made a change Jn
the record kept by Mies Perry at Blanch
ard's dictation. When . Roncovieri said
that she had blackened Raggio' s charac
ter by writing in "truant" without know
ing that such was the case. Miss Peck
ham replied that she had acted on the in
gtructioos of her principal..
Mrs. R: Reynaut, guardian of Edward
Cornu, said that while the boy was call-
Ing on Miss Perry he was almost unman
ageable, but' he improved when his visits
to her ceased.
TZACHZKS GIVE EVIDENCE.
Mies Emma L. Perry, the main witness
of the prosecution against Principal M. B.
Blanchard* who is now on trial before the
Board of Education, -was put through the
painful ordeal at yesterday's session of
listening to a number otf witnesses tes
tify that her reputation for truth was
bad. Miss Perry leaned the disagreeable
news from the lips '.of these witnesses
that she was not to be believed under
oath. The testimony was* extremely dls
tcs'teful to Miss Perry, and she made fre-,
quent protests against any such being ac
cepted, saying that she was not on trial.
In fact. Miss Perry intex-rupted the pro
ceedings on a number oÂ£ occasions, and
the gavel of President Deamau was often
pressed into service to subdue her numer
ous denunciations oft statements that
were made. ! . â¢ - Â¦;' *w -
Among the' witnesses called by Mr
Blanchard to impeach . the . testimony of
Miss Perry were George R. Kelly, : a
Teacher in the Lowell iligh School; Mrs.
J. M. Charles of Aiameda. und Mtb..A. M.
Smith of this city, ail of whom testified
that they had heard that Miss. Perry's
reputation for veracity is bad. "
Mrs. Laura Lowelino. who is ill, filed an
affidavit to the effect that she has known
Miss E. L. Perry for a year; that the last
named has been intiaoaie with the fam
ily and a visitor at Mrs. Lowelino's house.
Mrs. Lowelino swears that Miss Perry s
reputation for truth is Sad and she would
not believe her under oath. Mrs. Lowe

The deceased was born in the village
ofUhlfeld, Bavaria, on February 22.
1833. When twelve years of age he came
to the United States and obtained, em-,
ployment in Baltimore. From there i he
went to Philadelphia. In 1850 he came to

Rosenr'ela. who. was â¢Â¦one "of the oldest

man would order for the Central .Pacific
Railroad thousands of tons of coal . from
Rosenfeia without asking the price, and
the moment the account was rendered it
was audited without a moment's hesita
