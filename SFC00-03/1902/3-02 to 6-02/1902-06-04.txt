Boer diplomats would have liked a more
definite contract respecting the date of
the establishment of self-government, but
say the language defining {hat point in

grievously disappointed because the re

Reports of cruelties practiced by the

man. He made his reputation as an In
dian fighter and. rose from the ranks.

Large numbers of Yaqui laborers em
ployed at Noria del Verde and the ranch
of Pascual Martinez, near Carbo, have
deserted and only twenty-five well armed
men are now on guard at the ranch! The
refugees continue to seek protection in
Hermosillo, arriving there on passenger,
freight and wagon trains. They "report
that everywhere the Yaquis have taken
the warpath. Â¦ ,
FLEEING TO HERMOSILLO.
Luis Estrella, Chief of Police at Carbo,
arrived at Hermosillo on^ a train bring
ing a dozen Yaqui prisoners, who were
confined there to await the decree of the
Governor. A freight' train arrived - from
Poza, bringing all residents of that neigh
borhood. Such was the panic there that
the telegraph operator sent his resigna
tion to Superintendent Nauglo of the
Sonora Railroad, deserted his post and
sought refuge for the night at Carbo.
Reports from- that direction are. anything
but assuring, and several other tele
graph stations on the railroad have been
abandoned, but the company will no doubt
send men, to protect them. Several of the
agents at these points have been so badly
frightened that persons going to Hermo
sillo were ticketed to Magdalena, Santa
Ana and other points.
Ernesto Camou and several other mer
chants have asked permission of the Gov
ernor of Sonora to organize volunteer
companies and commissions have been Is
sued to them. General Torres has sent
several officers through the country south
and west of Hermosillo to recruit troops.
The Mexican soldiers are short of arms,
and an appeal was made by telegraph io
the authorities in Nogales for weapons.
All available rifles in Tucson were pur
chased and shipped yesterday. Only fifty
rifles and 5000 rounds of ammunition could
be procured. , The volunteer forces orga
nized in Hermosillo arc awaiting the ar
rival of these* arms.
As soon as he learned of the disaster
which had befallen the detachment Gen
eral Torres withdrew the remaining
forces from the Mazatan Mountain dis
trict and is awaiting reinforcements. Two
hundred mounted troopers* are on their
way to join his army. General Torres
has ordered all officers and men in the
Yaqui River country to the seat of the
fighting. On their arrival ho will have a
formidable. army with which to meet the,
Yaquis. He has sent out native scouts
who are loyal to the Government and
hopes to be able to take the Indians by
surprise. . Â¦
The wounded arriving in Hermosillo
were fatigued from the long journey and
in a sad plight. The population of Her
mosillo had become calm, but the report
of the battle and the Government col
umn's defeat caused great excitement.
TORRES .WITHDRAWS TROOPS.
Thirty Mauser rifles were dropped on
the field by fallen Mexicans a.nd captured
by the Yaquis. These will be of great ser
vice to the Indians, who arc said to be
well supplied with ammunition.
Fifteen of the survivors were wounded,
some seriously, and for this reason they
were greatly hampered in the retreat.
They finally reached the main body under
General Torres and the wounded were
brought -to ilJetifesiUo.. Owing to tb.e.

OFFICERS FALL INT BATTLE.
Captain Celso Gomez, for forty years in
the service and famed as a Yaqui fighter,
was fatally wounded and died before he
could be taken to Hermosillo. Lieutenant
Jose Vallcjo was killed on the field and
Lieutenant Magana fatally wounded.
The surviving Mexicans retreated in
great disorder. Only one officer escaped
unharmed. \ Â¦Â¦Â¦
Notwithstanding- the odds in favor of
the Yaquis, the, small party of Mexicans
made a brave stand. Their ammunition
was soon exhausted and the soldiers en
gaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with
the Indians. It was at first reported that,
fifty Mexicans had been killed, but late
arrivals give thirty as a conservative esti
mate. It is believed that more than fifty
Yaquis fell in the fight.

White and Marsh both pleaded guilty In
the Circuit Court to the charges brought
against them as a result of the deal and
were pardoned by the late Governor Pin
gree.Â» -
Director Kauffer of the Henderson-Amt-3
Company testified that after the Grand
Jury had been called Roos attended the
directors* meeting where the story toid
to the Ingham County Grand Jury was
arranged and a fund of $27,000 was raised
by contributions from each director, in
cluding Roos. This fund went to purchase
the certificate of deposit which was shown
to the Grand Jury in substantiation of
the story that the profits of the deal had
never been divided, but were still intact
for payment to the State. The case will
be resumed to-morrow.
White testified that the original invest
ment in the Illinois Supply Company and
$31,000 in profits was returned and waj
divided among Sutton, Marsh and himself.
White testified to-day that the fictitious
"Illinois Supply Company" was composed
of himself. Elf R. Sutton of Detroit, Gen
eral Arthur F. Marsh, inspector general
of the Michigan National Guard and a
member of the Military Board, and the
Henderson-Ames Company of Kalamazoo.
The plan of organizing the fictitious com
pany was suggested. White says, by ah
agent of the Henderson- Ames Company.
After the sale of the clothing to the Illi
nois Supply Company and its shipment to
the Henderson-Ames factory at Kalama
zoo, it was, he declares, retlcketed and
refurbished and then repurchased by tho
State from that company as new clothing.
The disbarment proceedings against
Roos are based on his alleged connection
with the frauds a3 a director of the Hen
derson-Ames Company of Kalamazoo. In
1899 a quantity of military clothing that
the State held under the Spanish war fund
act was sold to the Illinois Suppry Com
pany by the State Military Board ior $1').
500, and then the same clothing subse
quently was repurchased by the board for
the use. of the National Guard ior more
than $50,000.

White, ex-quartermaster general of tho
Michigan National Guard, to-day in his
testimony before the Supreme Court in
the disbarment proceedings against At
torney E. S. Roos of KaJamazoo, told for
the first time the full story or the State
military clothing frauds and declared that
Colonel Eli R. Sutton of Detroit, who wan
acquitted of complicity in them by a jury.
was a party to the fraud and received his
share of the profits. His testimony created
a sensation in view of Sutton's indictment
and subsequent acquittal after a long and

PARIS, June 3.â At a Cabinet meeting
held at the Elysee Palace to-day and at
which President Loubet presided, Premier
Waldeck-Rousseau formally presented the
resignations of the Cabinet, and in doing
so expressed the sentiments of gratituda
which his colleagues and himself retained
for the constant kindness the President
had shown them. â¢
President Loubet in reply said he re
gretted the decision of the Ministers, and
thanked them for the co-operation they s
had lent him in difficult times.
In the letter to the President tendering
his resignation Waldeck-Rousseau says
the state of his health compels him to
take a rest. Moreover, he considers that
the task which he took up Is terminated
and that the recent elections produced a
majority sufficiently powerful to assure
not only the maintenance but the devel
opment of republican institutions.
Loubet in reply announced that the
President accepted the resignation, and
charged the Ministry to carry om affairs
until the appointment of their successors.
Loubet will begin his consultations to
morrow. Senator Combes, former Vice
President of the Senate, is regarded as
likely to be the first man who will be
asked to form a new Cabinet, and It is
thought he may undertake the task with
good chances of success.
The Cabinet which resigned consisted of
the following members: President of the
Council and Minister of the Interior, Wai
deck-Rouseau; .Minister of Finance, CaU

they came to an agreement and arranged
to establish the new service on the same

the present, i to reduce the running time
below twenty hours. Of the New York

mud-colored vapor. We now know that this
presages a serious explosion. We heard fear
ful detonations during tbe 26th and husce col
umns of black smoke, alive with lightning-like
and terrifying flashes, rose from the crater.
Oue column which rose to the height of .1
mile and a half was lit ud like fire from the
fierce reflectioi* from the incandescent matter
within the crater. The population of Vive,
plantation .became Danic-stricken at ths erup
tion and went to Aclro, two miles- farther
away. Mr. Jaccaci and I returned to Vive.
Another enormous exclusion occurred the
morning of the 28th and Vive was declared to
be untenable. We all abandoned the planta
tion, and takinjr furniture arid provisions, went
to Aclro, which from that date was our base.
The 30th we tried to ascend to the crater
from this side along the Cale Basse divide.
From the crest of the divide we had a won
derful view into Fallaise Valley, which was a
tremendous seething: gorge of terrible volcanic
activity. We were driven back by a severe
May 24 we went to Basse Polnte by way of
Morne Rouge. Our party was the first to
make this trip. We .followed the old road to
the point where the volcanic tornado had
swept. From there we followed down the track
of the tornado. The spectacle here was ap
palling. There were numberless bodies on
every side. *
On the nisht Of the 26th occurred the great
explosion of the volcano. All tHat day Mont
Pelee had been vomiting masses of yellow
The itinerary of our party was as follows:
May 23 we went to Vive plantation, the prop
erty of Herman Clerc. Vive is on the river
Capote, into which flows the river FallaUe
from the new crater. Vive is In the new vol
canic area and our position there was very
dangerous.
The ascent to Lake Palmiste is up a long
and sharp incline, covered with these ashes.
These had been soaked with the rain and as
we proceeded there were terrifying gorges full
of volcanic debris on each side of us. Every
footstep dislodged ashes and our footing was
most insecure. There were clouds of smokÂ»j
through which the sunlight swept at inter
vals. The ascent was the most terrifying ex
perience of my life, yet Professor Hellpriu,
the previous day. 'had sat enveloped in dark
ness on the top of what was once Lake Palm
iste and had descended in a thunderstorm oJ
volcanic clouds and almost complete dark
ness.
Five of us started for the crater of the vol
ccno last Sunday and three of us reached our
object. We crossed Lake Palmiste, which ' is
now dry. and boulders and huge ragged rocks
of trachyte, rhyolite and andeslte. We then
clynbed on up and reached the edge of tB'e
crater. AVe found it to be u huge chasm or
crevasse, with perpendicular walls. We could
not see down into the crater more than 150
feet; it was like looking into a white hot fur
nace. The chasm opens out toward St. Pierre,
but the enormous columns of steam cut off
the view in that direction. There' were hun
dreds of fumaroles all about us. What was
thought to be the cone of cinders in the crater
was learned in reality to be a huge pile of
gigantic rocks piled up ono upon the other.
There were crusts of sulphur everywhere, but
we saw no ashes or cinders in or near the
crater. The whole vast bed of the old crater
and of Lake Palmiste is emitting steam
through thousands of crevasses. '
No accidents occurred on the trip up the
mountain, although the explorers were
exposed to many hardships and dangers.

the Southern Pacific Company's south

shortly after 11 o'clock to-night near An

killed and a number of passengers were
injured. The dead:
W. R. WHITE, engineer.
R. D. VAN TASSELL, fireman.
These are the only two fatalities report
ed in the meagre account received In this
city, but the loss of life may have been
greater. None of the names of the in
jured have been received. The bodies OS
the engineer and fireman are still under
the wreck.. - .
The cause of the catastrophe was a mis
placed switch, which had been tampered
with by some miscreant. The locomotive
was completely demolished and several of
the forward cars are badly smashed.
There was no warning of the disaster and
the engine crew had no chance to escape
death by leaping/ from the cab.

FRESNO, June 3.â Twelve hours ago
the country for. miles around, comprising
Wolters Colony, Auberry Valley,' Squaw
Valley and Pollasky, fifteen to "twenty
miles from Fresno, was a fertile region,
covered by ripening grain and corn,
heavily laden fruit trees, grape vines and
excellent pasture. Now this country pre
sents a scene of devastation and barren
ness. An army of grasshoppers settled
down upon the land and not a leaf cr a
blade of grass escaped the ravagers.
Everything which is green is doomed.
A patch ten miles square, just across
the river from Pollasky, is covered by
grasshoppers or locusts, presenting an
even, brown appearance, ever moving and
shifting, but never a green spot visible.
Further east, toward Auberry Valley,
hundreds of acres are likewise covered.
It is impossible to make any estimate as
to the amount of damage they will do.
The hoppers have â¢ only . arrived and
there is no telling how long they intend
to remain. To give an idea of the.dam
age they, may do, it is sufficient to say
that seven years ago one rancher near
Pollasky was visited by the plague, which
be fought bravely for four months, at the
end of which time he had lost $8000.
SANTA FE DECIDES TO
FIGHT THE STRIKERS
Railroad Company Declares a Lock-
out at Its San . Bernardino
Shops. :
SAN BERNARDINO, June 3.â The sit
uation at the Santa Fe machine shops in
this city has not^improyed, and from the
present outlook the trouble will not be
settled for some time. Railway officials
and representatives of the shopmen
were in conference during the afternoon,
but were unable to reach an agreement.
The railroad officials agreed to every de
mand of .; the striking boiler-makers in
this city, but the men refused to go back
to work until a settlement were made
with the strikers at Needles. This
seemed to make g. settlement out of
question and determined the railroad offi
cials in declaring a ldckout, which took
effect to-day.
That the Santa Fe is determined to
fight to a finish is shown by the fact that
it has Issued orders to reduce the steam
pressure on all engines twenty pounds,
thus saving the boilers and lessening the
liability of accidents.
Desertions From the Ranger.
SAN DIEGO, June 3.â During the past

The night parade also promises to be
a most attractive affair, for In It will be
introduced a number of novelties that, are
calculated to make the onlookers open
their eyes. A feature of the parade will
be *the introduction of light effects, so
that all may have an opportunity to un
derstand what is meant by the phrase so
often used in Shrine literature, "holdlr-g
on to the rope." Great preparations are
being made for the pioneer feature, which
will be an emigrant train such as existed
in "the days of old, the days of gold, the
days of '49." During the march this will
b-Â» attacked by a band of red men, and
there will be a skirmish to illustrate the
danger of the early pioneers. Colonel H.
J. Burns, an old-time Shriner, who came
over the emigrant trail in the latter part
of the '40's, will be the scout for the gold
seekers. There will be a large float rep
resenting California. On this there will
bo a young lady personating Eureka, with
a bear at her feet emblematic of the seal
of the State, and surrounding her will be
a number of young ladies, all dressed in
white, covered with popples, each repre
senting one of the counties. This float Is
to be drawn by white horses decorated
with garlands of golden poppies.
A number of other floats are to be an
nounced In a few days, each of which will
make a fine showing.

Edson is Â¦Â» determined officer and some
of the citizens of San Jose are inclined to
believe he is on the right track. He is
part Mexican and is conversant w!th the
country to which he is going.
Waselewski escaped from the officers
and nothing was heard of him for years.
Edson. in the meantime, kept up his
eearch. spending his own money. He
made several futile trips about .the coun
try and Fer.t out circulars at his own ex
pense. Finally Edson located "W'aselewski
in a jail in New Mexico, where he was
serving time for sheep stealing. Requisi
tion papers \were obtained and Edson
brought the man back to San Jose. Here
he was tried, convicted and hanged. At
the last session of the Legislature Edson
was allowed $1009 for money expended in
the quest.
Kdson knows Dunham intimately. For
years Edson was a Deputy Sheriff of this
county and he was a shrewd officer. It
Â¦wsa he who hunted down Juan Waselew
eki. who about twenty years ago mur
dered his wife in Los Gatos. Edson and
the woman, before she became Waselew
ski's wife, were lovers, but she Jilted Ed
son to marry the man who afterward
killed hc-r. After the murder Edson swore
vengeance and at once started on the
trail of the murderer.
The news from Sacramento to-day that
Edson had obtained requisition papers on
Mexico substantiates to a degree what
Edson gave out here.
Dunham, when he left here in 1896, was
supposed to have gone south and from
time to time reports hove been received
that he was seen in Mexico. The mur
derer of the McGIincys was a thorough
Spanish scholar and this evidently helped
him with the Indians, if he went among
them. Edson told one party that the
murderer was with Indians in a moun
tainous country and he expected to en
counter trouble in getting him. Dunham
is said to exercise great Influence over the
Indians and the latter undoubtedly will
light for him.
Edson was here about ten days ago. At
that time he spoke of having Dunham lo
cated, but refused to give any details.
He told several persons he was positive
of his man's identity. Stayton, a short
time ago, was in the Southwest buying
cattle and is said to have received infor
mation of Dunham's whereabouts.

SAN JOSE, June 3. â James C. Dunham/
the murderer of the McGlincy family Â«it
Campbell, is said to be a subchief among
the Navajo Indians in the State of So
nora, Mexico. It has been reported that
a v.hite man is with this tribe and that
he answers the description of Dunham.
Juan Edson, a former officer of this coun
ty, received information a few weeks ago
to that effect and last Friday evening he
started for Sacramento to obtain extradi
tion papers before proceeding to Mexico
in the hope that he will catch the mur
derer and earn the $11,000 reward offered.
With him is W. H. Stayton, a former
Constable of Gilroy.

of New York, called for detailed informa
tion on expenditures, etc., during the

DOAN'S KIDNEY FILLS.
That never rested feelingâ ' . %
Tired all dayâ and all night, tooâ worse in the morning
than in the; evening â .
Most tinies it's the kidneys' fault â Kidneys are sick â
Poisons are being carried all through the system â
Backache is the cry for help â the cry of the sick
kidneys â
make matters right quickly â cure every kind of Kidney
ill â backache, urinary troubles, diabetes â Proof?
Plenty of it right here â j
San Francisco People Say So
men and women who have been cured â you can't doubt
testimony like this â
Mrs. B. Carrington of 168 Linden? avenue (B. Carrington, packer),
says: "Reading a paper one eveniner I chanced to notice that Doan's Kid-
ney Pills cured a backache and other incidentals due to either excited or
weakened kidneys. I was subject to pain in the back, always more
acute if I caught cold or overexerted myself. At the time I noticed the
advertisement I was actually suffering I think more than usual and pro-
cured a box of the Pills at the Owl Drug Store, 1128 Market street. The
treatment stopped the last attack. Other members of my family have
used Doan's Kidney Pills and received as undoubted benefit. My advice
to any one troubled with kidney complaint in any of its forms is to use
Doan's Kidney Pills."
Doan's Kidney Pills are for sale at all drug stores â 5Oc a box â

Rate Advances to Ninety-Five Per Cent and Speculators Continue
to Gamble on Her Chances of Arrival at Queenstown*
rate of reinsurance on the
I German ship H. F. Glade was
if advanced yesterday to 95 per cent.
LL the highest mark that has been
. reached in speculation on over
dues for seme years. The Glade is now
out 227 days from this port for Queens
town. She has not been heard of since
the tugboat cast her off outside the head?.
Not cr.ly is the rate on the Glade at toy
notch, but never in the history of local
reinsurance speculation has a vessel been
a-n extensively played and probably never
Ix.fore have so many speculators been
tviiling to back with money their con
fidence in the safety of a ship more than
iriree months overdue.
M. A. Newell & Co., the local reinsur
ance brokers, have placed more than
$160,000 of San Francisco money. 4 on the
tiliide's chance of arrival. The raising of
the rate to 95 per cent is a Â¦ practical
itbandenment of the hope on the part of
the underwriters. Tfc-e loss of hope, how
ever, seems to be confined to the Old
World, for in San Francisco the feeling is
still strong that the Glade is all right.
The rate on the British ship Elliot, out
107 days from Carrizal for Baltimore, was
ytstitrrday advanced to 90 per cent.

WILL REPORT UPON THE
EFFICIENCY OF TEACHEBS
Judging from a circular issued yester
day ' by Superintendent of Schools Web
ster, it would seem that the official named
has given way to ; the contention of the
Board of Education that he should pass
on the efficiency of teachers. Mayor
Schmitz also held that this Is part of the
duty of the Superintendent and ills depu
ties. The circular is addressed to princi
pals ar.d says : .
Please observe subdivision 6, section 36 of
the rules and regulations of the Board of Edu
cation, according do Instructions in circular No.
7. If the deficiency of any teacher be so grave
as to merit in your Judgment an investigation
by this office for the purpose of preferring
charges, please make a separate report on suien
'teacher, setting â¢ forth all necessary details.
Section 36 of the rules requires princi
pals to make a written report to the Su
perintendent on Jure 20 and December 20
of each year as to the efficiency and suc
cess of the teachers in., their schools.
Such report is to be at once submitted to
the Board of Education by the Superin
tendent. '
Many persons who watched Mains dur
ing the progress of the trial are of the
opinion that he is mentally unbalanced.
Charles R. Mains, "Western representa
tive" of his own four-billion-dollar syndi
cate, made motions in the United States
District Court yesterday for a new trial
and arrest of judgment. The motions
â¢were denied and Judge de Haven sen
tenced the prisoner to six months' im
prisonment in the Alameda County jail
and to pay a fine of 5500. Mains was con
victed of using the postofflce for the pur
pose of defrauding Dr. Charles E. Ben
nett of Wauseon, Ohio, out of $3000 on the
pretense that he would make Dr. Bennett
president of a wealthy syndicate at a
handsome salary.
The maximum penalty for the offense to
eighteen months in the. State penitentiary,
but in Imposing sentence Judge de Haven
took into consideration the facts that
Mains had been confined four months in
the County Jail in this city while await
ing trial and that Mains was an attorney
at law and confinement in a County Jail
would injure him physically and in repu
tation as much as imprisonment in the
penitentiary would injure a ma.n less high
in the social scale.

It looks as if every Democratic candidate for Con
gress this year would make his own platform to suit
his district. The party has no issue save that of win
ning the offices and no campaign shout except "Get
there, E!i."
Democratic State headquarters -in New York are
to be established this year at Albany instead of New

The most striking proof of the fearful impression
produced among the American people by the vol

while holding the position of an acting
commissioner of the court. He came to
this part of the country in the early sy&

were not crowned with very great suc

PERSONAL MENTION.
" On the 21st inst. a meeting will be held
In San Rafael at which all. the boards of
trade in Marin County will be represented
by delegates. Then action will be taken
to persuade the Supervisors of Marin
County "to make an appropriation, under
the law, for the purpose of bringing in a
desirable population. Out of this activity
has grown the proposition for the forma
tion of the North Coast Counties' Associa
tion. The counties that will be asked to
Â£end representatives to the meeting to be
held in San Rafael for the formation of
the association are Marin, Huniboldt, Del
Norte, Sonoma, Mendocino, Napa and
l*ike. San Rafael is picked out for the
meeting place because the delegates from
tho north, having to come down by water,
WHI find it convenient to visit San Ra
fael rather than some point farther in
land, and it will be central for all the ter
ritory in several counties named.
The northern coast counties >of Califor
nia will probably have a North Coast
Counties* Association. Such Is the plan
that has been originated in Marin County
and it bids fair to' be carried to a con
clusion. When that is effected nearly all
the sections of the State will be organized
for the promotion of their own interests.;
There is much stir among the live people
in Marin County over the subject of mak
ing their resources and advantages
known. An organizer has been appointed
to visit every town in Marin County for
the purpose of organizing a local board
of trade in each town. At Sausalito a
good organization was effected last Mon
day night. Manager Filcher of the State
Board of Trade was present and gave
good advice concerning the work to be
performed in building up Marin County.
President Soule proposes to Manager
Filcher, who approves of the plan, to have
at least one 'of the shingles exhibited in
the rooms of the State Board of Trade in
this city. The relic will be placed under a
glass in a case and to It will be fitted a
handle so that it can be turned to exhibit
both sides. In the same room will' be
placed a photograph of the tonner Fort
( Humboldt. The shingle will illustrate his
tory and at the same time be an eloquent
testimonial concerning the durability of
the "lumber of Humboldt County.
President Soule of the Bank of Eureka
has written to Manager Filcher of the
State Board of Trade proposing to have
included Wi the display of the products
of Humboldt County in this city, to be
shortly instituted, some interesting relics
of Ulysses S. Grant when he was a cap
tain of the United States army in Cali
fornia. President Soule writes that Cap
tain Grant, afterward general-in-chief of
the armies and President of the. United
States, was stationed about six months at
Fort Humboldt in 1853-54. There were
then about twenty buildings the fort,
of which all but two have been taken
down. Of the two remaining, one stands
on the brow of. the hill upon which the
fort stood. Some years ago some of the
singles from the historic roof were se
cure.I and they have since been carefully
preserved in Eureka. They are a shaved
shingle, so writes President Soule, and
were put on when the building was erect
ed in 1S52. An affidavit exists to the fact
that the shingles were put on the roof In
that year.
Finally it is reported that when Prince Henry was
here he said to some American military men in
Washington, "I would like you to 'see our autumn
maneuvers." The military men took that as an in
vitation, and accordingly our Government set about
making arrangements for the visit. The matter, how-
'.That storyalso has been contradicted. It appears
that some men in New York, talking over the Fred
erick the Great statue, suggested it would be a good
thing to send a bronze Washington in return. They
did not offer to do it; 'however, and' so Berlin need
not sit up at nights waiting for the statue, to come.
Another mistake is this: Some one announced in
Berlin that the United States, .in grateful recogni*
tion of the kindness of the Kaiser in bestowing a
statue of Frederick the Great to adorn Washington
City, had decided to give Berlin a statue of Wash
ington. That story roused much admiration in Ber
lin and people were planning what they would do
when the statue of the grand old republican stood
among those of kings and emperors. Some thought
they would- take a holiday and spend the day doing
reverence to the republican, while othtrs thought
they would move out of town for fear their loyalty
might be corrupted.
It is now stated there is jio truth in the story. A
clipping containing it was sent to the Kaiser in the
ordinary course of business and the next day his sec
retary gave out to the public the imperial denial. It
is said the Kaiser wrote on the clipping, "I have
never heard of Potts before, and did not know there
was such a man, and still less that a Captain Potts
had been ordered to Berlin."
A short time ago it was reported that the Kaiser
would refuse to see Lieutenant Commander Potts,
who had been appointed naval attache to the United
States Embassy at Berlin, because Potts had made
disparaging remarks about Admiral Schlcy. The
story was warmly received here. Among the friends
of Schley the warmth was that of a true delight.
They went about saying: "The Kaiser is a great
man. He knows a hero and he knows how to treat
a slanderer of the brave." The opponents of Schley
received it with the warmth of indignation, and they
went about asking one another why Kaiser Wilhelm
had to do with the matter anyhow.
OUT of the affectionate desire of Kaiser Wil
helm to be good to us and to show himself
congenial to republican institutions there are
coming a series of. little mistakes that are annoying.
We are getting reports about the Kaiser that- are
not true, and doubtless the Kaiser is getting reports
of us that are not true; hence there is likely to be a
general misconception arising out of a number of
mistakes in themselves so little as to . be hardly
worth noting.
MISTAKES ALL AROUND.
A "problem of that kind would hardly fret an Amer
ican college in any but the poorest and most sparsely
settled districts of the country. Great Britain is rich
and populous. Edinburgh and Oxford have among
their graduates some of the richest men in the/world.
Why should they not raise the money needed by
their alma mater to meet such emergencies? Why
fret over the lack of $8000 when there is air London
to appeal. to?. That trait of character exhibited by
the authorities of Edinburgh. and Oxford is British,
hnd shows no slightest kinship to Americanism.
The London Times says it "cannot but fill many
minds with an uneasy misgiving as to the financial
ability of the university to rise to the full height of
the large responsibilities certain to be imposed upon
it as a consequence of the Rhodes bequest." As an
explanation of these misgivings it is stated that for
the last fiscal year there was a deficit in the univer
sity finance's of something more than $8000. . It is
that shortage that frets Oxford. The . venerable
university ponders the thought and the fear that if
she cannot meet current expenses no"w her condition
when she has to furnish instruction for a large addi
tion to the number of her students will be that of a
bankrupt institution.
No American university would be troubled by
such endowments. Even the smallest of our col
leges would accept an offer of $10,000,000 on almost
any terms, and if it could not exactly meet all the
requirements it would at least make a stagger at
doing so and hold on to the money. Edinburgh,
however, hesitated and halted before the Carnegie
donation until the '.lonor kindly changed the terms
en which it was to be given, while Oxford is per
plexed to know what she will do with the additional
students that will be brought to her colleges by the
new endowments, and in her perplexity is calling the
attention of the world- to the fact that she is not rich.
WHILE there riiay.be many points pf simi
larity between the American and the Brit
ish people, there arc certainty some very
notable points of difference. One of those differ
ences has been brought out first by the hesitation of
the University of Edinburgh to accept Carnegie's
large gift for the promotion of free education, and
more lately by reports that Oxford is troubled by the
large endowment left for the Cecil Rhodes scholar
ships.
OXFORD IS TROUBLED.

A New York man called up a hospital by tele
phone and asked that an ambulance be sent to his
residence for a wounded man. He then shot himself,
but he made a mistake in his calculations and when
they arrived the ambulance men found a corpse in
stead of a sufferer. The incident however serves to
show how well ordered things are in a modern city.
All would have been right in the case had the man
thought to call up the Morgue instead of a hospital.'

After all was done, and* the day had made its due
impression, custom left one formality to the leisure
and inclination of Congress. This was the passing
of an appreciative resolution by .Congress, extend

uttered its voice and expressed its emotions. Here
was an opportunity for the minority in Congress to
blunder,' and it was improved. Mr. Champ Clark
of Missouri in the patriotism of the address discov
ered partisanship, and when the resolution came be
fore the House a wrangle was brought op.
It was inexcusable and most ungracious. We
freely say that it was r.ot the sentiment of the hon
est Democratic masses of the country. It was merely
another evidence of that small and petty leadership
which has degraded a once great party. It Was as
indecent as a quarrel between mourners at a funeral.
But no consideration of propriety deterred the pur
blind promoter of the scene. The day was saved by
Hooker of Mississippi, an ex-Confederate, -xho re
buked the foolish plan and affirmed the freedom of
the address from partisanship and declared for its
ability, fitness and propriety. The good sense of
most, of the minority was indicated when only forty
six Democrats followed their small leadership by
voting against the resolution.
The spectacle of a nation officially mourning its
fallen chief, solemnly dedicating a day to truce in
party strife, in order that common interests and' the
larger things in which all Americans and all men
agree might be considered, was especially inspiring,
and Mr. Hay caught its. full inspiration and projected
it forward to all who heard and to all who will read
his splendid address.
In all the country no better selection could have
been made." He was a member of Mr. Lincoln's
official family when the great President was mur
dered, and he was the chief of the Cabinet when Mc-
Kinley. was martyred. A poet, statesman and ora
tor, with the quality of imagination which could
draw out of his closeness to these two great trage
dies every lesson useful to his countrymen and the
world, he had been reared under the same condi
tions as the two murdered Presidents, and those
conditions he formed into an enchanting background
for his address. It was masterly in its simplicity. It
went straight to the heart, and quickened every sen
timent of patriotism and humanity in the hearts of
men.
A MIXED committee of Congress, composed
of members of both parties, arranged the
simple but stately memorial service in honor
cf President McKinley. That committee selected
Secretary Hay to deliver the memorial address.

In the violent incidents of the strike in Chicago
Americans see the need for the organization-, and
methods of the Civic Federation as a reasonable ar
biter between the contending forces. Mr. Franklin
MacVeagh, who is at the head of that body in Chi
cago, is a wise and reasonable man, who may be
trusted to secure justice, peace and order, if there be
any on the strikers' side authorized to meet him and
with power to enforce obedience to a decision.
The exertion of mob force is an attempt at such
deprivation, and the administrators of the law have
no choice except to resist such force to the last ex
tremity.
This abstention may have left open the way to
peace that will, leave the. two battles of Monday the
only disorder jn the history of the strike. The au
thorities should not forget that they' are dealing
with an clement that is not trained in line with our
institutions at all. Tens of thousands of people in
that city do not speak the English language. They
need not be blamed for .not knowing that in this
country the law determines and limits every man's
rights, and that the only force that may be used is
in securing to every man his legal privileges. Un-'
der our system, properly administered, it is just as
impossible for one man to deprive another of his
legal rights as if is for another to deprive him of
them.
We do not enter into the merits of the labor, dis
pute in that city; indeed but little, seems to, be
known outside about. the cause of the struggle. All
that is definitely known is that reason seems to be
entirely absent from any effort to settle it, and force
is appealed to by both sides. Leaving all that out,
the streets of an American city should be made safe
for all orderly people who must use them in doing
the ordinary business upon which depends the life
of the community. In this country the law is the
supreme ruler, and when the law abdicates, or 'is
powerless to rule, comes chaos. It is very fortu
nate that in the preliminary struggle no shot was
fired by the police. The force, .seems to have been
well controlled, and the men to have admirably re
frained from other use of their revolvers than as
clubs.
The affair has reached a point at which it re
sembles the investment and siege of a city by de
priving its people of the necessaries of life. Food
and fuel are being taken -away from the -people, and
the attempt to supply them is obstructed by a force
that numbers thousands. The popul.ation of Chicago
is. especially adapted to such a passionate movement.
Americans are in a minority there, and the majority
is made up of that peculiar immigration of which we
have for years received an excess from Continental
Europe. . .
THE Chicago strike seems- to be nearing the
danger line. The 'stubborn fights on Monday
between the police and strikers indicate that
the elements involved are charged with possibilities
of a storm that will require more power than the
city can command to control it.
THE DANGER LINE.
The retirement of Nixon from Tammany Hall up
sets the apple cart of the reorganizes who were
counting- on a united Democracy in New York to
help them sidetrack Bryan; 1 . As the matter stands
now the smile is on the face of the man in Nebraska.
Senator Morgan's declaration, made from the
Democratic side, that our proper policy is the per
manent subjection of the islanders, holding them in
submission by military force because we need their
country in our business, is, in its essentials, the same
as Kitchener's death or banishment order of â¢< last
year. May we not profitably copy the opposite pol
icy pursued by. Great Britain in the Boer settle
ment?
That example may well impress our Own country.
With President Roosevelt admitting that the future
may disclose independence of tli% Filipinos as our
proper policy in the Philippines, and with Senator
Spooner enlarging upon the same admission, may
not the American people well consent to think less
about military prestige and more about ending the
severe and sanguinary and costly struggle in the ar
chipelago by now declaring that to be our policy, as
these leaders have admitted that it may be in the
future?
Turning to the British position, it cannot be de
nied that it reflects credit upon tha$ nation. From
the standpoint of her Continental enemies she ihas
made concessions' unworthy of a world power. But
the English sense of justice accepts these concessions
as right and. humane and having those elements
which,* after all. are the foundation of true~ national
greatness. In fine, England has written it into her
world policy that right must be the rule, no matter
what others think about it. She is to be congratu
lated upon this conclusion, and the world is to be
felicitated upon the example she sets for others to
follow.
That England will observe and carry out in good
faith her part of the convention no one doubts. In
the extravagant excess 6i jubilation in London over
the result one may easily see evidence that the peo
ple were tired of the struggle and would not have
sustained it to the extent of submitting to conscrip
tion of soldiers to keep it up. In a military sense, the
Boers have forced a drawn battle, and. in their firm
ness in exacting the most favorable terms ever
given under like circumstances is seen their own
consciousness of ability to indefinitely prolong the
war, and the admission of Milner and Kitchener that
the result would be in doubt.
In all respects the entire treaty is a distinct vic
tory for the people of the two republics, and. when
worked out will cause the institution .of a govern
mental system almost exactly like that of Canada.
In many important particulars this treaty leaves the
Boers in a much better condition than after the Sand
River treaty, inasmuch as it removes all doubt about
their position and secures for them a far higher de
gree of independence than is enjoyed by their kin in
Cape Colony.
Now the brave fellows get their homes and per
sonal liberty and Great Britain pays them fifteen mil
lion dollars for the wanton destruction of their
farmsteads, exonerates their property from' any tax
to pay the cost of the war, and agrees to loan them
for two years, without interest, an indefinite sum to
aid in the restoration of their homes and fortunes.
They get also their own language in their schools
and courts, and a. prompt substitution of civil for
military administration and the installation of the
institutions or self-government.
THE terms of peace in South Africa arc dis
closed and reflect great upon the stead
fastness of the Boers. It is. apparent that
peace could have been had last year upon the terms
now agreed upon. Kitchener's harsh ofder, which
proposed the banishment of all the burghers, was re
sponsible for the continuance of the war, because
it left the Boers no alternative but to fight.
GRAND OFFICER WILL
BE GIVEN RECEPTION
WASHINGTON. June 3.-The House to
day began consideration of the anarchy
bill. The House committee reported , a.
substitute for the Senate measure. Kay
of New York, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, who was in charge ef the bill,
argued that the Senate biil waa'unconsti
tutional.
Ray explained the difference between
the Senate bill and the House substitute.
The purpose of the House bill was to pro
tect the President, the Vice President and
those in the line of the Presidential suc
cession, and also prevent the entry int>
the United States or the naturalization of
persons T?i:o preach anarchy or forcible
destruction of government. The impera
tive reason for the passage of this blil
was the non-uniformity of State laws for
the- Dunishment of homicides.-
The Senate bill, Kay contended, was un
constitutional because It provided the
death penalty for the killing of the Presi
dent, the Vice President and those in line
of succession, without regard to whether
at the time they were engaged In the per
formance of thej/ official duties.
Every decision of the Supreme Court on
the subject, he said, indicated that Con
gress had jurisdiction to enact laws pun
ishing offenses against ofHcers only when
they were engaged in the performance of
their official duties, and for that reason
the House substitute used the language
"any person who unlawfully, purposely
and knowingly kill3 the President while
engaged In the performance of his official
duties or because of his official character
or because of any t>t his official acts or
omissions', shall suffer death."
Lanham of Texas approved that portion
of the bill designed to prevent and dis
courage the coming into the United States
of all persons who oppose government and
seek its subversion. Anarchists, he said,
should have no place in a free govern
ment. \ B.ut, he said, he could not give his
assent to the passage of a bill ' that sin
gled out any particular citizen and made
It a special offense to take his life. Ho
denied that any honest, law-abiding man's
life was more sacred than another's.
The laws against murder In the several
States, he argued,, were ample for tha
protection of all. -Besides, he doubted
whether such a. law as was proposed to
be passed would add to the protection of
the President's life. To violate such a
law might all the more magnify the Im
portance of the deed In the distempered
mind of some anarchist.
Lanham wanted to know why foreign
embassadors and ministers had been sin
gled out for such protection and the
Speaker of the House omitted. He re
garded the Speaker as moire Important
than the Vice President or a Cabinet offi
cer." Â»â¢ - Â»
."If I were President of the United
States," said Lanham, "I should rather
not have this bill oh the statute books."

ever, turned out'to be a' mistake.- Henry was merely

City Attorney Lanefiled an opinion yes
terday with the Board of Supervisors in
which- he holds that the Board of. Super
visors has no power to transfer the Lin
coln School property to the Public Library
Trustees. The board had selected the site
named for the purpose of building there
on the library building donated by An
drew Carnegie. Lane holds that the prop
erty does not belong to the city and coun
ty, but is vested in the Board of Educa
tion for school purposes only. The opin
ion says: . -â '
It would appear that every lawful endeavor
possible was made by the city and county,
under legislative sanction, to devote the Lin
coln School property exclusively to school pur
poses. Assuming that the Legislature has
power to change the character of the public
use to which vublic property may be Â¦ put and
also assuming that the Legislature may prop
erly exercise such power by means oÂ£ a free
holders' charter and further assuming that the
authority may be vested in a Board ot Super
visors to determine when such public use shall
be changed, we. reach the question herein con
ridered, namely: Is property, the legal title
to which is in the Board of Education, the
beneficial title to which is in the public, ! and
in which, as Is . said in Martin vs. Board of
Education, supra, the municipality as a cor
poration has no . proprietary interest â Is such
land property belonging to the city and county,?

LINCOLN SCHOOL
SITE IS BARRED
Should any persons wandering through
Golden Gate Park at an early hour this
morning hear pistol shots they may know
that some gallant Frenchman, or maybe
two,\has been sent beyond the turmoils
of. this turbulent sphere, but it will be
great satisfaction to the people of the
country to know that influential gentle
men of this city had, as law-abiding cit
izens, done all in their power to suppress
a bloody and unlawful- deed.
The threatened "shooting match" is. the
outcome of a wrangle that occurred on
board the steamship Australia, which ar
rived here on Sunday from Tahiti, the
parties to the quarrel being Guy de St.
Brlssoni administrator of the Marquesas;
his wife, Mme. de St. Brisson, and Ensign
J. Rey of the French navy.
The ensign's side of the story is -that
the husband is wroth because sufficient
attention was not shown his wife. M.
Brisson's side is that his anger was
aroused because of the ensign's alleged
studied and therefore insulting frigidity
toward the lady.
ENSIGN OOLDLY POLITE.
Mme. Brisson is a lady of distinguished
bearing and beautiful to look "upon and
Monsieur is beyond everything else in the
world proud of her amiability and love
liness., When the good ship steamed away
from Tahiti the good M. Brisson Intro
duced madame to the young ensign, who
politely acknowledged the honor conferred
upon him with a low bow, and for a time
the matter ended. But the naval officer,
as people on board vessel do, came face
to face with the wife of the administrator
of the Marquesas Islands and politely
made his compliments -and admitted his
distinguished consideration by raising his
cap, out without demonstration or ecstacy
Once again the two met during. a deck
stroll and Ensign Rey, with the gallantry,
minus the I warmth of his countrymen,
acknowledged the honor of the meeting
with a bow and the usual formality.
Mme. Brisson, who was used to the at
tentions and homage of all men who had
Deen given the honor of an introduction,
felt that the ensign was cold beyond all
accounting and M. Brisson himself took
the chilly "How de do?" as an affront,
for he as much as his wife, admires those
who admire her, and those who fail in
that pleasant particular in his estimation
are to him deserving of chastisement.
DROPS CHALLENGE ON DECK.
So worked up was tlje Administrator
of the Marquesas Islands that â¢ he sat
down and .wrote Ensign Rey a
letter, in which he is said to
nave reflected in a most uncomplimentary
manner on that gentleman's conduct.
1 urser Fulcher was appealed to, and so
was Captain Lawless, but no one could
be coaxed or bulldozed into delivering
the missive Thereupon the angry Bis
son, with the genius of a Dumas, made
sure that all on board should know the
contents and feared not that by that
means the purport of the letter would
reach Rey. He thereupon dropped the
:etter on the promenade deck and it was
picked up and read and some one .hand
ed It to Rey. On perusing the matter he
discovered that Bisson had therein called
him a.,' hog/' but in the most polite
trench, and had further challenged him
That was sufficient.
A^ h^ ! " cri , ed H Â® y - " Hc calls me a hog.
Ah! He insinuates that I am from Chi
cago, while he knows well that I belong
t<v La Belle France. Blood will alone
satisfy me. I am an invalid; I am on
leave to recoup my health; I cannot hold

I can wield the pistol; I can shoot; I

The officers were appealed to and Pur
ser tulcner, in the hope of abating the
'xcitement, showed, in a playful way, the
cannon of the vessel and brought down

PASSENGERS ALA3MED.
A,^ a ?Â« ayS thc , P as sengers aboard the
Australia were kept in a state of excite
ment. Brisson could not forget and Rev
remained at a loss to know exactly wha*
;jarm he had done. He agreed that he
had. not been profuse in his attention to
3 l me ,\, ? riss<>n . but he asked why he
should be compelled to pay court to any
ady. He contended that he had been po
litely respectful, and considered that thvt
was sufficient. And so argued every one
with the good III. Brisson. but to no LaH
If they would not be allowed to fight a
duel on shipboard, then, declared the nery
Brisson, they must fight when they land
ed in San Francisco. Once on land lie was
sure that he could obtain seconds and
Rey, he was as certain, could likewise hiÂ»
as conveniently accommodated. No sooner
had the Parties to the dispute landed last
Sunday than Brisson looked around for
gentlemen who would assist him in ar
ranging the details for the duel. He him
self, demanded that it should take 'place
this morning and that the battle ground
should be in thei vicinity of Golden Gate
Park, and friends at once sought Ensfen
Rey and made him acquainted with the
determination. Rey has been diligently
engaged in an endeavor to secure seconds
and Brisson, even went so far as to try
to secure the kindly services of a well
known Imperial Consul 1 representing hiÂ«
Government in this city to act for him in
the affaire d'honneur. Â¦
Yesterday all were busy-seriously
busy. Meetings were held and Brisson
was at his wits' end, for. several American
friends informed him that under the nensu
law of the State of California such a
thing as a duer was a most serious offense
for either a principal or seconds. ense
ASKS KEY'S APOLOGY.
During the afternoon the friends of
Brisson called upon Rey at the Hotel Sn
yoy and begged that he would soothe
the enraged husband by tendering- '.n
apology which might terminate all im
pending hostilities. Rey declined to aDol
ogize on the ground that he had Insulted
nobody, and, therefore, had no apolosv
to make. i H '
At a late hour last night Brisson was
still on the warpath and hU' American
friends came again to him with advice
They told him "that if he must fight for
his honor, then, the best and only Â«,Â»
was to go about it In American fashion
and have it out on the street." iaoiuon .
Brisson objected, because, as he dp
clares, it would not be in accord with tho
code duello, or in keeping with French
precedents. u
He was again made to understand thp
law on the matter of duelling in thu
State and uttered many "sacres" and
â¢'diables." u
That the two gentlemen will meet to
day is a certainty, according to the state
ment of the friends on both sides but nf^
tola are barred. ' l
All concerned admit that they are thor
oughly worked up over the affair and do
not conceal their 'apprehension as to the
result. .
Elaborate arrangements have been
made for the annual outing and picnic of
the parishioners of the Church of St. John
the Evangelist, which will take place on
Thursday, June 12, at Fernbrook Park.
An enthusiastic meeting of the commitr
tee in charge and many of the prominent
parishioners was held last Sunday even
ing: and the final details of the annual pic
nic were completed. There will be a large
number of prizes and a military band will
be in attendance. Irish music and dances
will be a feature of the day, and the pro
gramme of races is a very long one. A
most enjoyable time is predicted for those.
who attend and the Rev. Father Brady is
working hard to make the outing one long
to be remembered.
The officers of the day and the com
mittees in charge of the picnic are as fol
lows:

Captain Colin Salmond of the steamer
Wellington spent a very uncomfortable
day in Judge Hebbard's court yesterday,
and so did his wife, Mary E. .Salmond.
They have had a merry time of it since
their marriage in 1836; and both of them
are now trying to secure a divorce. Mr3.
Salmond is determined that she shall get
the decree on a charge of cruelty, and the
captain is. equally determined ttlat he
shall get' the divorce. Fully twenty wit
nesses have appeared so far in the case
on behalf of both the litigants, and a
great deal of contradictory testimony has
been given. Mrs. Salmond accuses her
husband of being too lavish with his af
fections, and Captain Salmond says his
wife consorts with people of poor charac
ter.
Mrs. Salmond was a witness in her. own
behalf yesterday. She denied that she
ever accused Salmond of having too many
lady friends, and branded her 'husband's
charges of cruelty as falsehoods. She
never, she said, made Salmond's life mis
erable by accusing him of being unfaith
ful to her. and said that at no time on the
steamer Wellington did she humiliate him
by upbraiding him in the presence of his
fellow officers.
"Has your husband ever beaten you
within the last two years?" asked Gavin
McNab, Mrs. Salmond's counsel.
"Very often," was the answer. "He once
threw a teapot at me, and on another oc
casion he struck me on the head with a
vase, shattering the vase into a thousand
pieces."
Mrs. Salmond said that she never as
sociated with a v/oman whose character
was bad, and denied having any knowl
edge of a Mrs. Moors. She said she knew
of a Laura de Laveaga, having met her
at 310 Ellis street, where her Jather and
mother resided.
ADMITS HIRING SPOTTERS.
She admits having had Salmond's
footsteps dogged on several occasions,
and says she did it because he failed to
come home after his vessel arrived in
port. According to Mrs. Salmond her
husband is an inventive genius. She says
his income of $250 a month as captain of
the Wellington is swelled every month by
receipts from patents he is interested in.
"What articles has he patented?" 3he
was asked.
"Well, he is interested in a megaphons
attachment, a fog signal, a hook for the
back of theater seats and a billiard cue
chalker." '
Miss Laura Thompson was also a , wit
ness. This young lady said she met Sal
mond at the Portland House, in Oakland,
at Mrs. Salmond's request, to ask him. to
return to his wife. She said there was
nothing improper in the meeting, she be
ing there simply as a peacemaker. Miss
Thompson rr.et the usual fate of the
peacemaker, acc6rdin.tr to her testimony.
She said she was leaving the house when
she was confrontpd by Mrs. Salmond and
a Mrs. Farnsworth, both of whom were
apparently very angry.
"They called me a nasty thing," said
Miss Thompson, plaintively, "and Mrs.
Farnsworth assaulted me, breaking my
hairpins, knocking my hat off and causing
my clothes to become disarranged. I was
rescued by a gentleman, who came up
and requested Mrs. Salmond and her
friend to leave me alone."
' The case was continued until Thursday
morning.
.,: SMITH WAS SHAMMING. .
. The . divorce s,uit. of Maud A.-. Smith
against W. F. Smith, the well-known
architect' and clubman,- was" heard In
Judge Sloss' court . by Judge Murasky
yesterday. Further testimony will be
heard this morning- â¢ â¢ Â¦'Â¦
Mrs. Smith testified that Smith com
menced abusing her thirteen months after
their marriage, in 1S95. She said Smith
possesses a violent temper and would fly
into a rage without 'the. least provocation.
Mrs. Smith said also " that Smith com
pelled her to get up at night to apply hot
plasters over his heart and to give him
brandy and water, claiming that he was
suffering from heart disease. She said
she waited upon him until her fajnilv
doctor informed her that Smith was
shamming. "Immediately I ceased wait
ing upon him," said Mrs. Smith, "the at
tacks ceased." ! â¢â¢â¢â¢-â¢_
Mrs. Smith's testimony was* corrobo
rated by that of her mother, Mrs. Ade
laide McDonald.
Judith E. Murphy has brought a suit for
divorce aginst James L. Murphy for cru
elty. She alleges that he frequently has
beaten her. The- Murphys were married
in 1901.
Lulu Keep Weldon is suing Ellas Wal
lace Weldon for divorce for failure to
provide, alleging that though he is em
ployed as a school teacher at a salary of
$70 per mqnth he does not support her.
They were married in Oakland in March,
1S94.
Soren Peter Nielsen commenced a suit
for divorce against Bessie Neilsen yester
day, alleging cruelty. He charges his wife
with threatening to kill him. They were
married in April, 1901.
Suits for divorce were also filed yester
day by Annie Caroline Postel against
Frederick August F. Postel for cruelly.
Harriet Howe against George E. Hovye
for cruelty and Edward Kirby Keener
against Raphaella Acosta Keener for cru
elty.
Divorces were granted yesterday' to An

There was an active demand for Consoli

NEW YORK, June 3.-r-It would be useless to
peek for anything but a negative Inference
from the operations in to-day 1 s^ stock market
owing to the smallness of the dealings and the
languid movement of prices. Variations of as
much .as a point are rare and must be sought
I among the obscure portions of the list". An
I example of the curb market Is' offered by St.
Paul, usually an active leader of the market,
. but in which there were only three transac
tions up to 2. o'clock to-day. It Is necessary to
go back nearly two years to the period preced
ing the last Presidential, election to. find such
show .of stagnant speculative interest. The
.undertone was rather firm, as the immediate
new developments were favorable to values.
The baying was entirely by the small profes
sional traders and the market was so narrow
that they were obliged to concede all of the
advance in price caused by their bidding In
order to close even a contract. The traders
bought during the first hour from k the' belief
that the success of the anthracite operators
In keeping their mine pumps going in spite of
the strike -would presag.- a rise in the
value of anthracite stock Imnortance was
also attributed to the notable Increase in the
receipts of corn and the resultant decline In
the corn market. The immediate benefit of in
creased traffic for railroads by the larger re
ceipts was considered of much less consequence
than the obvious inference that the freer of
ferings of corn were due to belief of planters
that the coming crou would be abundant The
higher rate for money was probably the most
lntluentlal factor . in repressing speculation.
Rates for call money ruled ct about last
week's maximum throughout. The syndicate
operations last week which resulted in the
$15,000,000 loan expansion by the banks are
liable to be repeated In kind at almost any
timÂ«; and. the effect on the money market in the
present narrow state of surplus reserves is an
object lesson against free speculative commit
ments.' â¢ â¢ ' ;

The weekly report cf A. G. McAdie, section
director of the climate and crop sen-ice of the
Weather Bureau, Is as follows:
General summary â The temperature has been
slichtly below normal during the week, and the
weather generally clear until near the close,
v.hen showers occurred in the central and
northern diEtricts. Kri^k winds have prevailed
in tte valleys and along the coast.
Grain harvest has commenced in portions o^
the San Joaquin Valley. Wheat, barley and
oats arc developing rapidly in the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys, and prospects con
tinue good for heavy crops la nearly all places
exeppt the south, where the yield will fall far
below average and in .some cases the crop will
i>e a failure. Rain caused but little damage
to rrain, but injured cut hay in some locali
ties ThÂ° hay crop is turning out unusually |
heavy and of superior quality. Reports from ,
BoatterB California Indicate that whÂ»at will
yield abcut half the average crop, barley wiU
be a fair crop and hay heavier than for sev
Â«-r&! years. Sugar beÂ«?t6 will probably be lisht,
cwirR to scanty rainfall. Hops, beans and
â¢vegeuibles are doir.s v.-ell.
'.'berries, strawberries and other small fruits
were considerably damaged by the rain. Apri
cots cf excellent quality are in market. Prunes
In Sonoma County are developing better than
expected a few weeks ago, end some growers
expect two-thirds of a crop. Pears In the San
Joaquin Vallev have been s<=riousiy injured by
ij'.ight. Otner deciduous fruits are In good con
dition. Vineyards are remarkably thrifty and
a heavy yield of grapes is probable. Citrus
'rulxs and walnuts are doinc well.
Sacramento Valleyâ Abnormally cool weather
has prevailed during the week, with fresh
srjt.ho.riy winds and rain, and heavy snow In
the mountains.. Grain has been benefited by
the <~oo: wrather and but slightly damaged by
rsin; wheat, oats and barley are in excellent
condition .and prospects continue good for
heavy crops. Haylr.g has been somewhat re
tir-ied tiT.i some hay damaged by the rain.
<""herr!Â»s and other small fruits were also con
riderabiy damaged, but in other respects the
~?i*i v.as very beneficial. A shipment of apri
cots wai> made irom Gulncla early in the week.

CHICAGO, June 3. â At one time wheat gave
promise of a good bulge.' Liverpool cables
were weak, luxuriant growth was reported Iroin
most of the Western fields and the weather was
all that could be expected. This caused an
opening weakness, but support in the way of
buying July started an up-turn. "Tailers '
came in on the buying side, as did commission
houses, and July, which had opened %@V"jc
lower at 71%(ii71%c, advanced to 72Vic. Part
ot this strength was given through the decrease
of 5.417.0U0 bushels in the world's visible sup
ply. This prie'e, however, could not withstand
the constant selling pressure that was brought
to" bear from the Southwest and the Northwest.
Karly crop talk influenced the crowd to change
sentiment arid soon everything was on the
down turn. July slumped sharply to 71 1 /i<
and closed .weak, v^^^c down, at 71%@71%c.
Corn ruled weak all day. Cables were rather
firm, but the foreign markets were dull. The
big bull Interests were buying for a time, but
succeeded only in steadying the decline. July
corn closed weak, I@n4c lower at 01%c.
Oats, were stronger than the other grains to
day, but were dull and featureless as far as
ttadins was concerned. July closed unchanged
at S0Â»ic
Provisions showed strength after a weak
opening. Hogs were firm at the yards in spite
of the teamsters' strike and heavy reductions
in ribs stocks induced good buying. , July pork
closed 2',2C up, lard unchanged and ribs 5c up.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
::iuch and long-desireU time tu work a trine
ahead in their order books. There is hardly a
tcuare in the city of San Francisco that does
not witness some building improvements, and
the demand lor constructive material, both lum
ber and steei, is extremely active, and ditficulty
is e*perieii<-*d in tilling the calls. The Crocker
Ustaie Comi>a:iy found that the only way to
eeeure their sieel material was to order it irom
abroad, for this country lound its mills too
heavily crowded with orders to admit of deliv
ering any linisheti products withiu nine months
or a year, and this same status of conditions
can be lound in the lumber circles, lor one
day last month taw this city ten million feet
behind the requirements. This plainly shows
a remunerative condition of affairs and the mill
owners and shingle plants are enjoying the
heiÂ£ht ol prosperity."
"The economic law of supply and demand
v.as never better illu'strated than In the cur
lent conditiQPS of the Pacific Coast lumber
ir.arket for ihe month just closed. There has
been a. noticeable increase in the number and

"Prices have advanced, for the supply is far

Fancy Oranges are scarce and sell readily
when obtainable. Poorer grades are In liberal
supply and move slowly. The" same may be
said of Lemons. Two cars of Oranges will be
auctioned to-day.
A small drawpr.of Peaches came in from Va

Four boxes came in and sold for 75c per box.
Apricots a"re coming In more freely from
the interior. None came In from Yuma. but
Figs were received from the same place and
sold at a decline. Supplies of old Apples are
almost exhausted. Green were offering freely,
but sold slowly. â¢
Cherries were mostly In good order and
choice offerings brought the top quotations

Choice lots of Strawberries sold promptly at
full figures, but such offerings werÂ« light.
Most of the Longworths were soft and muddy,

NEW- YORK, June 3. The Commercial"Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram 6ays :
Stock market activity was much reduced to
day, partly because of Epsom week. Prices
reacted under a steady stream of realizations
all round; following peace, but the feeling is
not one of despondency. It is thought that the
free profit-taking will leave the markets
healthy and that the public will gradually edge
in, particularly after the coronation ceremo
nies. . i
Consols closed ' at 96 13-16, after selling at
96 9-16. - ,
American stocks â¢ were almost forgotten by
most dealers and there was hardly one trans
action.- Prices sagged all day, closing at the
bottom, the coal strike exercising a paralyzing
effect. ' â¢
Copper was % down to Â£54% the ton. Rio
Tintos were % down to Â£45%.

LÂ»oyle was born in County Wexford,
Ireland, seventy-six years. ago, and came
to this county while quite young. Whea
the news of the discovery of gold In CaÂ»
iiornia reached the East, L>oyle, witn
hundreds of others, ' set out for the
new KJdorado. lie was a man ol keen
business Instinct and soon came to the
conclusion after arriving here that hi*
trade, that of a carpenter, oflered a surer
if a slower road to fortune than mining.
He accordingly engaged In the contract
ing and buiidjng business and in a very
shurt tune bum up a large business. Wltu
his family, he took up a home in th-Â»
Mission, at that time almost a wilderness,
anu became identified with all of its in
terests. He lived to see that section of
the city grow into a populous district
and in all its progressive movements ho
took an active interest. He was of a
kindly, charitable nature and won for
himtelf a host of friends. In politics he
was a Democrat, and although often
urged to run for office he declined. Ha
was at all times willing to help his friends
politically, but for himself he preferred
the walks of private life. He was nom
inated for Freeholder by hi3 party a few
y*'urs ago, but declined the honor, al
though a strong effort was made to keep
him on the ticKet. Six children sur.lve
him, the Rev. Father Alexander Doyle,
a noted Paullst missionary father of New
York city, Sister Mary Fldelis, Lady Su
perior of the convent of Our ' Lady of
Lourdes. Oakland. Sister Mary Louise of
St. Mary's Hospital in this city, and
Stephen. Frank and Peter Doyle, also oC
this city.
Judge Fritz continued the case for a
week, but warned both Rudolph and Mul
cahy to stop making remarks to each
other when they meet on the street. If
Rudolph does so Mulcahy was instruct
ed to atrest him and if Mulcahy Is the
offender then Rudolph will have his rem
edy before the Police Commissioners.
Mulcahy testified that Rudolph had been
his enemy since he arrested Mrs. Rudolph
about six months ago for disturbing tne
peace and that every time they met
Rudolph would pass offensive and insult
ing remarks. On the afternoon of the
arrest Rudolph, who, according to Mul
cahy was under the influence of liquor,
was particularly offensive. When Mul
cahy placed him under arrest Rudolph
attempted to strike him end continued
his abuse all the way to the patrol box
and while, waiting for the patrol wagon.
Mulcahy was corroborated by Dr. C. H.
A. Davis, who testified he was surprised
at the officer's endurance under the of
fensive abuse, and also by W. Jennings.
For the defense Rudolph testified that
Mulcahy first attempted to strike him
and called him a "gunflghter." He denied
that he was under the Influence of liquor
and called James Welch, George Ryan
and William Maxwell to testify to that
effect.
Jake Rudolph, at one time a lieutenant
for Chris Buckley, charged with disturb
ing the peace, was tried yesterday before
Judge Fritz. The arrest was made by
Policeman Mulcahy on Powell street on
the afternoon of May 26.

LANKTHZE REFUSES.
The strange part of the new develop
ments is that George A. Oakes was a
warm supporter of Dalton for Congress
in the light against Meicalf and has al
ways been known as a Dalton man out
snd out. Stedman is an employe of the
i-nquirer, the paper in which Dalton is
charged with owning an interest.
The affidavits are as follows:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, June 3.
Two affidavits were submitted to Dis
trict Attorney Allen this afternoon upon
which a request was based for criminal
prosecution of County Assessor Henry P.
Dalton. The District Attorney declined to
issue any warrants until after further in
vestigation, but It is very evident that the
County Assessor has another fight on his
hands. The affidavits are made by George
A. Oakes, editor of the Haywards Journal,
anu R. R. Stedman, an employe of the
Oakland Enquirer, and In effect they tay
UULt County Assessor Dalton, in August
last, gave Cioorge Oakes an order for sev
enty-live assessment books and thirty
mortgage books for his office. Oakes said
that lie wouid turn the order over to the
Oakland Enquirer, and did so. The affi
davits then assert that the books were
never printed or delivered to the Assessor,
but that the bills were put through the
Hoard of Supervisors, and these claims
were then presented to J. IS. Lanktree, a
H r - Olc<?r ' aI1 " discounted. One bill was for
?s.a, and the other for $000, Lanktree re
taining- $75 for his commission and issuing
cnecks for $1500. The checks issued by
Lanktree wore made payable to Oakes,
ana were indorsed by him and turned over
to Danieis, and now bear the signature of
Daniels as the final payee.
Neither Dalton nor Daniels will say that
the books were ever delivered, and pend
tixs an examination into this fact no move
will be made by any of the authorities.
Da.ton says it is merely another phase of
the political light being waged against
mm. and Daniels claims to know nothing
about the matter.
I will stand by the statements I made when
I tvaa accused before â that it is all rot and
politics. There is nothing in the charges anc!
the result will be the same as it was in those
other accusations. I don't know what is the
matter with this fellow Stedman. I thought
he was my friend, and besides he is employed
on the newspaper with which I am particularly
friendly. And Oakes â I don't know what ails
him, for I have done a great, deal for Oakes
in many ways. .
I won't attempt to explain anything. Every
thing will come out in time. I don't know
whether those books are In the office or not.
My chief deputy, T. C. Robinson, sees that we
get everything that Is paid for, and I don't
Affiant further says that he knows of his
own knowledge that "the seventy-five assess
ment rolls" "working," described in said bill
numbered C582 were never made or delivered by
eald Oakes or by anyone to said county of Ala
meda or to said Assessor or to any one for
said county or said Assessor, and that for more
than fifteen months last past no such books
have been used or kept by said Assessor or by
said county.
Affiant further states that both of said claims
have been allowed and have been fully paid
by the county 'of Alameda and that the said
money has been Illegally, unlawfully and cor
ruptly obtained from said county.
That the eaid Oakes, Daniels and Dalton are
close and intimate associates and affiant verily
believes that the said three persons unlawfully,
wickedly and corruptly conspired together for
the purpose to and did defraud said county of
Alameda out of the amount of said bills, to-wit,
$1575. â¢ :

19th day of August. 1901. G. B. Daniels, then
and there was, and ever since has been, the
busliiesb manager and president of the En

the said 10th day of Aurust, 1001, said Daniels
said to this afhant at the office of said En
quirer Publishing Company, situated on Tenth
street, between Broadway and Franklin, of the
city of Oakland, in substance and'effect: "For
affiant to see immediately Henry P. Dalton,
meaning thereby Henry P. Dalton. the Assessor
of the county of Alameda. and George Oakes,
and assist them in discounting some bills
p. gainst the county of Alameda which' thÂ«y
then and there had. That Immediately there
upon this affiant proceeded to the Courthouse
and to the office of said Dalton at said Court
house and upon arriving there found said Dal
ton and said Oakes at the office of said Dal
ton. That the said Dalton then and there re
queeted this affiant to make out two certain
bills against the county of Alameda and in
favor of George A. Oakes. That the said bill3
were then and there drawn by the affiant in
accordance with and from data furnished to
affiant by eaid Dalton, and which said bills
were thereafter filed and are new on file with
the clerk of the Board of Supervisors and
County Clerk of Alameda County and Auditor,
and are numbered and known respectively as
Nos. 7Â£S1 and C582. That upon said bills be
ing drawn the said Dalton and Oaken said In
effect that they wanted to have these bills
against the county discounted, and that said
Oakes had approached one Lanktree to have
the bills discounted, but that he had refused
and wanted affiant to get Lanktree to discount
That thereupon affiant and said Oakes pro
ceeded to the office of said Lanktree and after
considerable discussion of the matter with said
Lanktree the said Lanktree finally agreed to
discount the said bills, and thereupon said
Oakes assigned eaid claims to Lanktree and
the eald Oakes then left, and this affiant wait
ed and the eald Lanktree did then and there
deliver to this affiant his personal check drawn
in favor of said George Oakes for the sum of
six hundred dollars, in payment of two said
bills- that affiant thereupon took the check to
said Dalton's office and then and . there deliv
ered the same to said Dalton. -That within a
week subsequent to said 19th day of August,
1301 said Lanktree did deliver to me a check
drawn by said Lanktree in favor of said George
Oakes for the sum of $900, said sum being
the balance due on said bills, less $75 discount,
and thereupon I immediately did deliver the
said check to said G. B. Daniels. That these
copies hereunto annexed and marked exhibits
"A" and "B" are now on file in the Auditor's
office of the county of Alameda and said copies
were made by me. That within one month last
past I have seen in the possession of said
Lanktree the said check for $000 above de
scribed, and the same had indorsed upon It as
the final payer the name of G. B. Daniels,
and w.-;s also Indorsed by said Oakes. That
I also saw at said time last referred to said
check for $500 drawn by said Lanktree to the
order of said Oakes -and Indorsed by said G.
B. Daniels as final payee and also indorsed by
eaid Oakes; that affiant knows of his own
knowledge that the thirty mortgage books de
scribed In said bill No. 7281 never were made
or delivered by said Oakes to said Assessor or
to any other officer of the county of Alameda
or to the county of Alameda, nor did anyone
else make or deliver any such books at or about
or before or since the 19th day of August. lt>01,
to said Assessor or to said county of Alameda
or to anyone for said county or Assessor, nor
are there any such books in said Assessor's
office or-Â«ny county office, except sixteen such
bocks which were made about two years ago
by said Enquirer Publishing Company and were
paid for about then by said county to said
company.
Affiant further Bays that he never received
the eald mrney, or any part of the money
represented <r called for or paid upon said
check. Affiant further says that when the
order was given to affiant for the said books
affiant positively understood that the Â¦ En
quirer Publishing Company would print and
deliver said bocks to said Assessor and to said
county. That afftant never made or delivered
the said bocks or any of said books described
in said bills to said Assessor or county or to
any one. That affiant never caused any one
else to make or deliver Eald books or any there
of to said Assessor or county, but always sup
posed, and still supposes, that said Enquirer
Publishing Company did make and deliver said
books and all thereof to said Assessor.
That certified copies of the bills above de

STOCKTON, June 3.â That Mrs. George
Leroy Tindall fc. not In the city raorguj,
where her husband was formerly employ
ed as assistant. Is due to the poor marks
n:anship of the husband, who fired three
shots at her this morning with a revolver,
at close range. On their way down town
from the railway station, whither they
had gone to meet their young son, who
did not arrive, Tindall placed a revolver
against his wife's back as she was tying
her shoe, but the weapon missed fire:

POSTUM CEREAL.
"If my name will do any good, use it,
for we J-tand by Postum always. Mrs.
W. A. Bower*. 29 Ninth street. Franklin,
Pa.: 1
"I was almost as bad as he but am now
entirely well, and have gone up from 08
pounds to 10S pounds and am so thankful
for the blessing of good health.
"When anybody mentions dyspepsia in
his Â©resence he tells them what cured
him.
"We concluded there must be something
about his employment that thus affected
him. One day a man told him that proba-
bly coffee was the cause of his trouble
and advised him to use Postum. The first
time I made it I studied directions and
made it good. Well, that day was a day
long to be remembered.
"We liked the Postum. but we had a
hundred headaches compressed into one.
You see the trouble was we had both used
coffee so long that our nerves were in .i
state of collapse without the usual stimu-
lant. Until then I did not dream I was
such a slave to coffee, but we had to do
something to quit, ro the next morning I
used Postum with part coffee and we
missed the headaches, then I used less
coffee every morning for about two
vrctks and then Postum alone for nearly a
year now, and I just wish you could see
the change in my husband. He has better
health than he ever had before, never has
the headache, can eat anything he wants,
dees ret have 1-eartburn or any stomach
trouble and he cannot be induced to drink
coffee under any circumstances.
A comparatively easy way out was
taken by a lady from Franklin, Pa., who
saye: "We had a curious experience w'th
coffee. Husband had been for many years
a sufferer from dyspepsia, with heart-
burn, headaches and general nervous
trouble. We tried a great many physi-
cians and a great many remedies, but
rone of them did him any lasting good.
The breaking away from coffee is an
exceedingly serious problem to many peo-
ple, especially when headaches follow
leaving off the drug, and dyspepsia and
bowel trouble grows more and more seri-
ous if the coffee is continued. So there
you are between two fires.

1 rUKERAL DIBHCTORS AND EMttAJLMEBThe. Grand Jury intends to take a hand
in the bail scandal and discover and
prosecute the guilty party or parties.
For thi3 purpose Expert F. A. Elliot was
instructed to examine Clerk Conway's
books. E. P. Farnsworth and M. J
Baughan were appointed a committee to
assist. The reports may possibly be
ready for presentation to the jury when
it meets next Friday at 2 o'clock.
methods of pilfering money out of the
treasury were first exposed.
Captain of Detectives Martin has or
dered all his men to be on the lookout for
the mlsing Police -Court clerk. The
police of all the neighboring towns have
also been requested to arrest Conway on
sight. It is doubtful if Conway can make
good his escape, as he is a well-known
character all over the State.
The proposed boxing match between
Jimmie Britt and Oeorge McFadden has
been declared off. Britt's hands were ex
amined yesterday by a surgeon. They
were found severely bruised about â¢ the
thumb and knuckles. The boxer was told
he would bo taking a chance of injuring
them permanently if he used them too
soon, so he canceled his engagement. He
leaves on Saturday for Harbin Springs,
where he will remain two weeks.
Britt-McFadden Match Is Off.
About 150 friends of the Hon. E..D. Ed
son, an aspirant for the Republican nom
ination for Governor, met last night at
1047 Market street for the purpose of-or
ganizing his campaign. M. H. Smith pre
sided. It was decided to make a 'careful
canvass in every district, and to that end
the friends of Edson will meet again a
week from next Tuesday night. .....
Organizing for Edson.
The push brigade In San Francisco is
sadly demoralized. Desertions from the
camp arc of daily occurrence. The re
maining forces consist of quarrelsome fac
tions which Mackenzie, Mar,ks and Rior
dan cannot manage. The apportionment
of delegates cuts no figure to speak of m
the approaching contest. The stalwart
Republicans who are in the battle for
good government and honest administra
tion of local affairs .will elect the dele
gates to the judicial convention^
Johnny Mackenzie, the new leader of
the boss forces, did not get a meeting of
the county committee last week, but' Tom
Riordan has issued a call for /the mem
bers to meet next Friday night. This
push committee, created by the conven
tion which nominated Asa R. Wells and
A. G. Fisk. claims to be the local' govern
ing body of the .Republican party and will
probably designate the apportionment of
delegates to the convention which will. b6
called to nominate candidates for Judgea
of the Superior and Police courts. '
The whispered comment among Demo
cratic leaders is to the effect that the
prestige of the Southern Pacific Company,
to the extent that Herrin can swing it,
will be placed behind the Democratic nom
inee for Governor. No doubt the political
agents of the company- will be "active
enough at the Republican State Conven
tion in the last week of August, but they
will also be at the Democratic gathering
in the early days of September. The re
ported defection of Burns and the peculiar
attitude of Herrin are cited as. incidents
significant, of a change of front on ithe
political field. The best informed pol
iticians In the Gage camp now admit that
Burns has broken away and will not take
part in the desperate struggle to obtain
from the Republicans of California an
other indorsement of Gase. - '
The call as outlined, for submission to
the general committee provides that the
delegates shall be chosen by Assembly
districts according to the manner pre
scribed in the primary election law of this
State. The committee not only recom
mends, but directly orders, primaries for
the, election of delegates in Assembly dis
tricts wherein the law is not mandatory.
The idea is that % the convention shall
emanate, directly from the voters of the
party and shall not" simply represent fac
tions, cliques and counts' committees.
All the indications point to the selection
of Sacramento as tjie place for holding
the convention. The delegates will prob
ably be invited to assemble in the cap
ital city on Monday, September 1, or Tues
day. September 2. San Jose, Santa Cruz
and Los Angeles have made overtures to
the committee for the honor of entertain
ing the delegates. There has been\ con
siderable talk of holding the convention
in this city, yet the sentiment in favor of
Sacramento is regarded as sufficiently ac
tive to sway the committee.
The governing body of the CaJifornia
Democrats will meet in this city next Sat
urday to adopt a call for a State nominat
ing convention of the party. A draft of
the proposed call has been prepared by a
sub-committee recently appointed. The
document as outlined will be submitted
to the executive committee next Friday
evening.
The basis of representation provided for
in the rough draft is one delegate for
every 200 votes cast for the party In the
Presidential election of 1900. In making
the computation the highest vote cast for
any elector on the Democratic ticket will
govern. This representation will give a
convention of 629 delegates. A recommen
dation will be submitted to add thereto
one delegate- at large for each county of
the. State. If this is adopted the conven
tion will consist of 6S6 delegates. ..
State Governing Body
of Democrats Is Pre
paring for Battle.

Captain Seymour, whose resignation as
chief of detectives was accepted last
night, tor his meritorious services as the
head of the detective-department.
Captain Spillane was given permission
to accept Captain Seymour's handsome
rank badge, which was tendered him by
the retired chief of detectives.
Thereupon Barrett requested the court
to make a ruling thai when the case was
set Jt fhould be tried on that day. even if
Conway was still at. liberty. This plan
was acceptable to the District Attorney's
office and Lyons' case was set for Satur
day morning at 11 o'clock.
Detectives .were scouring the town all
day yesterday and last night In the hope
of gettins some trace of Conway's where
abouts. His friends advance the theory
that lie has not left the city, but has been
secreted away somewhere with friends
until he gets out of the state of intoxica
tion In which he has been since * his
Assistant District Attorney Hanley ob
jncttd to the taking up of Lyons' case un
til it became absolutely certain that the
Defendant Conway had taken leave of the
<-ity. He argrurd that it was not the place
of the prosecution to. try the ca.se.s until
* "on way was apprehendr*! by the police.
Judge Cabaniss took the sajne view, and
although Attorney Barrett made a strong
plea for an immediate hearing, it was
denied.
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE CITY.
Then Attorney John Barrett, appear
ing for Lyons, informed the court that
liis client was more than anxious to have
his case called for trial. "My client.
Lyons, is a respectable young man," he
Fai.j. "and we wish to r.lear him forthwith
of this accusation. We are prepared to
prove that he wa? simply made an inno
cent tool by Conway."
Attorney Campbell* requested the court
to issue a ' bencn warrant for Conway's
arrert, but the court declined to enter
lain the proposition. Campbell explained
ihat he had put up the $500 bail money
for Conway's appt.-aranoe and the latter's
non-appearance .in court placed him in an
embarrassing position. Judge Cabaniss
declared the b;;il money forfeited.
BENCH WARRANT REFUSED.
The news that Conway ha<l "skipped"
ca*used a sensation in Police Court circles
when it was announced yesterday after
noon. When the case of Conway and
Deputy County Clerk K. E. Lyons, who
is a co-defendant with Conway in the
grand larceny charge rileu a^ a
result of the nrst expose of the methods
Â«jt" the Police Court ring, was called m
judge Cabanlss" court Conway failed to
answer his name. His attorney and
bondsman. Archie Campbell, who had
?j>ent more than twenty-four hours trying
to locate Conway. appealed to the court
for a continuance, staling that he felt
sure that if given a chance he could lo
cate the fugitive and bring him into
court.
Detective Ed "Wren appeared before
Judge Fritz yesterday afternoon and
swore to a complaint charging Conway
with forgery. The complaint sets forth
that Conway fraudulently attached the
signature of M. Walker 10 a treasury or
der for the return of $15 bail money that
had been posted for the appearance of L.
P. Walkmann. charged with carrying con
coaled weapons and disturbing the peace.
This is the most serious charge that has
been lodged against the missing clerk.
Fredrick B. Conway. clerk of Judge Mo
gan's department of the Police Court, has
taken flight rather than stand trial upon
charges of having stolen bail money from
the treasury which belonged to J. M.
Evans and bail money belonging to the
city which "had been declared forfeited by
Judge Mogan owing to the non-appear
ance in court of the defendants to whom
it originally belonged.
"On June 2, 3902, present to the office of
the Civil Service Commission and have
s?mc deducted from next month's salary,
if not paid on or before said date. George
A. McCalvy."
Heydenfeldt says that McCalvy stated
that the note, could be cashed at any time
and if it was not Heydenfeldt could take
MtCalvy's place in the Tax Collector's of
iice at- a salary of 4125 per month. Hey
denfeldt. who was easily beguiled, yester
day presented the note to Examiner Mo
rr.li, who informed him that he had been
deceived, as the commission had no power
to pay McCalvy's salary. Moran reported
the matter to the commission, which has
ordered an investigation on next Monday.
McCalvy was appointed from the civil
service list last August by Tax Collector
Scott.
- Tax Collector Smith yesterday suspend
ed George A. McCalvy, a deputy employed
in the office, pending an investigation of
a charge of obtaining money by false pre
tenses preferred by Thor O. Hey
denfeldt. son of the late Judge
Solomon Heydenfeldt. Young Hey
denfeldt. in a sworn statement filed
Â¦with the Civil Service Commission, al

McOalvy asked for a loan of $100 for the

from the vaults, but asked ' McCalvy for
security. McCalvy produced a blank note

SERIOUS CHARGE
AGAINST DEPUTY
BIG CONVENTION
IS RECOMMENDED
The defendant. Crothers. was called to
I testify, and he swore that Levings called
on him at the City Prison and asked him
if he could "dig iip any money to square
the case." He said Levings wanted him
to plead guilty to petty larceny and gi\e
him whatever money he could raise. .
Crothers further testified that upon tell
ing Levings that he would not ; plead
guilty to petty' larceny the policeman
said, "All right: then be railroaded."
The matter was continued until next
Monday afternoon, when Levings will
commence to put In his defense.
Policeman Wilson B. Scott was tried for
failing to search a prisoner properly, and
upon being found guilty he was fined $25.
Policeman J. D. McClain was tried upon
a similar charge and fined $20.
The Commissioners ordered Secretary
Captain Birdsall joined the police force
in April, 1878, was made sergeant in Oc
tober, 18S9, and lieutenant in 1895. Up to
last February he was stationed at the
Central station and since -then has been
at the City Hall station.
During his twenty-four years of service
Captain Birdsall has seen every variety
of police' duty and his record is without a
blemish. By no class will his promotion
be more favorably received than by the
men under him. â¢
Henry Gleeson became a patrolman in
1SSS and after some street duty was as
signed to the License Office, where he has
been ever since. He has made a splendid
record in his department and the omce
is a model one of its kind. He was made
corporal in 1895 and a .sergeant two years
later. His first duty was a detail with
Captain Martin and he has succeeded to
his superior's lucky star whenever he has
been promoted;
James Kelly joined the department in
1885 and was made a sergeant four years
later. He was derated in 1890 after â¢ a
secret investigation, but was restored by
order of the Supreme Court in December
of last year. He has been acting as patrol
sergeant at the Central station.
Thomas S. Duke joined the force in De
cember. 1S95, and two years later was
proinoted to a sergeancy. His most .re
cent service was desk work at the South
ern station. \ Â¦ . â¢
Chief of Police Wittman finished the
prosecution of the case against Policeman
L. L. Lcvings, charged with having at
tempted to extort a bribe from Mrs. Eliz
abeth Darling for "squaring" a case, of
grand larceny he had lodged against J; O.
Crothers in the Police Court. District At
torney Byington was called to the stand
and in response to questions put by Chief
Wittman he testified that Levings had
called on him in reference to the case
against Crothers #nd had during the con
versation given him the impression that
ho wanted to be lenient with Crothers.
The District Attorney testified that it was
his intention to charge the defendant.
Crothers, with obtaining goods by falso
pretenses, but that Levings suggested
that the charge be reduced to grand lar
ceny.

KAPID SERVICE.
TA reception was given in the- evening in
the Assembly Hall of the Red Mpn-<!
building by the lodges to thÂ§ supreme Sf
ficers and delegates. A dance followed.
It was decided at the afternoon, session
to give a banquet to the officers and dele
gates to-morrow night and Mmes. Boehm
Raymond, Dygert and Scholten were ap
pointed to make the necessary arrange
ments. Â¦ . .
A large portion of the afternoon, session
was taken up in the amendment of the
by-laws, which were adopted* six years,
ago and which are no longer advantage
ous on account of changed conditions
The changes made provide that lodges
shall have the power to elect any member
in rtnancial standing a representative to
the. supreme body. The law authorizing
each subordinate, lodge to elect a delegate
at large to the supreme body was re
pealed. A new section provides for a
board of arbitration in the subordinate
lodge and one in the supreme body with
right at appeal from the subordinate
board to the supreme board and from that
to the supreme body. An amendment
changing the time of collecting funeral
assessments from quarterly to monthlv
was adopted. It also provides that such
assessment must be transmitted before
the 15th of each month. A new section
provides that hereafter any new lodge in
stituted shall pay funeral â¢ assessment
from date of institution. "Another new
section provides for the manner of ao
pointing deputy supreme presidents, who
shall not be members of the Iodf-e to
which assigned and giving such certain
powers. The supreme president is to have
the power to approve or revoke any or
all acts of the deputies. Hereafter a ma
jority of the supreme body instead of a
four-fifths vote shall be sufficient to alter
or amend the laws of the order It wis
also decided that if an officer absent hlm
selr from three 'consecutive meetlnes
?' 1 , t i 1O^ t Â« >n3t , lt ,V tional excuse - the office
held by the delinquent shall become "a
cant. â¢ Â¦
The report of the supreme president was

The Supreme Ix>dge of the Friends of
the Forest, a purely local fraternal, sick
benefit and funeral aid asociation. met in
sixth annual session in the Red Men's
building yesterday morning with Supreme
President Mrs. M. M. Reid in the chair.
The following past and supreme officers
and delegates were present:
Here the trouble' commenced, or at least
at . this point Royston's trouble com
menced. He went to sixteen -different
stands in as many parts of the city, and
could not make a single bootblack under
stand what the subpena meant. The sons
of Italy "who maka da boota shina. lika
da sun" could not or would not under
stand when he requested them to' appear
before the jury,. He was told by the
bootblacks that they "no- catena, the com
prehend," or that "if we leava da work
we losa da mon." After trying- ;th'b ; six
teenth Royston gave up in despair and
went back to report that the authority of
the Grand Jury had been woefully ig-
The trouble arose when the Grand
Jury suddenly awoke to the fact thatUhe
bootblack stands which from time,im
memorial have held prominent but rather
objectionable positions pn the sidewalks,
are in direct violation of -thd charter, in
that they encroach and' obstruct the pub
lic highways. It was decided to investi
gate, the matter and to find out in what
locality rested the pull: of the bootblacks
which gave them leave to ignore the law.
Accordingly. Police Officer Samuel W;
Royston was instructed to summon
twenty of the principal bootblacks to'ap
pear before the jury. Â¦ . . v.
The members of the Grand Jury have
donned war paint and are resting on their
arms ready to do battle at a moment's
notice. They claim that the sacred ma-'
jesty of the law, as represented by their
august body, has been most flagrantly ig
nored, and they are panting and thirsting
for vengeance. -The innocent offenders
and the cause of the jurymen's wrath are
the sons of sunny Italy who operate
bootblack stands on the public streets. It
is not feared that an International com
plication will grow out of the. difficulty,
but it is certain that a labor disturbance
will result, as the jurymen have signi
fied their intention of declaring a boy
cott against the wieldcrs of the blackpn
ing brushes. .-.-'. . .' . . * "
