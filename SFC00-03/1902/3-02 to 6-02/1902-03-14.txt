The Coroner's jury in its verdict held
that "the child, which, was born alive
and lived several hours, died from hem
orrhageof the brain, which might, have
been caused during premature birth,' and
that Dr. Hagner, who attended at the
birth, was guilty of inexcusable neglect."
WASHINGTON, March 13.-Charles E.
Hagner, for many years a well-known
physician in this city and a member of
one of the oldest families, in this section,
was to-day held for the action of the
Grand Jury as the result of an Inquest
over the body of a prematurely born baby
of Mrs. Peter Blair.' found yesterday
alivo and doubled up in a shoe box,
thrown Into a garbage can In the rear of
the Blair house. At the inquest to-day a
colored woman pointed to Dr. Hagner as
the man whom she saw place the box in
the can. The latter, admitting he
was the man, said he fully believed the
child was dead at tho time. The physi
cian at the hospital whero the child was
carried after being found testified that
the baby was alive when received, and
the negro woman testified that the child
was crying when she found it.

Frazier's success was so complete that
many other orchardists will try his plin
this year. It is expected that it will
cpiue into general use on the coast.
In an orchard of thirty-five acres he
scattered fifty large tin kerosene lamps
so made that chimneys were unnecessary.
Each night during moth time the lamps
were filled and lighted, burning until
morning. They attracted to them millions
of moths, which were burned and de
stroyed. Frazier found that the kerosene
cost less than his neighbors were paying
for spraying fluids. The trouble of light
ing the lamps also was much less than
that incidental to spraying.
To kill young moths or larvae which
could not fly to the burning lamp Frazier
placed fly paper around the trunks of his
trees. Above this he wound burlap bands
to klep the paper from the air. When
ycunpr moths began ascending the tree
trunks to reach the branches they were
caught on the sticky paper and died.
TACOMA, March 13.â What is believed
to be an effectual method of conquering
codlln moths has been discovered by C.
K. Frazier, an experienced horticulturist
of Walla Walla County. For several
years since codlin moths began to damage
the fruit crop of this State Frazier has
been experimenting. Last year he ! suc
ceeded in producing a splendid crop of
apples and other fruits, while orchards
adjoining his bore fruit that was badly

WASHINGTON, March 13.-Late this
afternoon the work of harmonizing the
conflict over Cuban reciprocity had pro
gressed so far that a committee of con
ferees or arbitrators representing the two
sides of the controversy assembled to
frame a compromise agreement. The
meeting occurred in the private quarters
of the Ways and Means Committee room,
Â¦with Chairman , Payne and Representa
tives. Dalzell and, Cannon present In be
h,alf. of the Ways and Means reciprocity
element, while live members of the op
'positlon, namely Representatives Metcalf
of California, Dick and Tayler of Ohio,
Fordney of Michigan and Morris of Min
nesota, acted as arbitrators in behalf of
the Republicans who have resisted the
Ways and. Means original plan of 20 per
cent reciprocity for an unlimited period
l'he conlerence lasted about two hours
ai.d was not productive of final results,
an adjournment being taken until 2 p. m.
to -morrow. All the plans of compromise
that have been suggested were reviewed,
particularly that limiting the reciprocity
period until December, 1903. Beyond dis
cussing the several plans no action was
tuken. When the conference closed It
was stated that the discussion has been
along sucu harmonious â¢â¢ lines ' that an
agreement seemed assured." Chairman
l'ayne and his associates seemed to be
ltss confident than the other conferees
that an agreement was in sight. Prior
to the meeting of tho arbitrators the ele
ment opposing the Ways and Means plan
assembled to determine on a course of
action. It was decided to name five con
ferees Instead of three, in order to make
tne body more representative of the vari
ous sections interested. It was also
deemed desirable 'not to give the con
ferees power to make terms/ but only to
consider and report back. This precau
tion was taken in order that there might
r? a full understanding of the compro
mise plan by all of those who opposed
the original Ways and Means plan. Rep
resentative Tawney: of Minnesota, who
directed the contest at the outset, wa&
asked to go on the conference, but he de'
clined, and instead nominated the com
mittee of five subsequently named by the
conference.

Sherbert was awakened and found' him

he managed to make his way to 'liberty
and daylight after thirty-six hours of
a struggle. He reached daylight yester
day. He was compelled to scoop the
heavy snow out in front of him and roll
it into balls and pull it under his body
as he toiled toward the surface. Sher
bert made his way laboriously to the
Molly Gibson mine, where ho induced the
Italian laborers there under promise of
$10 to go to his companion's relief. They
shoveled thy snow off Bowden until they
came to his head and then they saw that

tho old Panama Company was first

The members of the Senate steering

CALL EUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.j WASHINGTON, March 13.âImpor
tant developments have cleared away
the diplomatic obstructions to the Hep
burn canal bill, which passed the House,
and Senator Morgan favorably reported
it to the Senate to-day without amend
ment. The bill is now on the Senate cal
endar and Ms chances of being brought
to a vote during the present session are
said by its friends to be better than ever.
Just before the final vote in the Commit
tee on Interoceanlc Canals was taken
Senator Morgan made an important state
ment, as the direct result of a conference
at the State Department with Secretary
Hay, relating to the attitude of Nica
ragua, Costa Rica and Colombia. Mor
gan was instructed by the committee to
confer with Secretary Hay concerning
certain points' in the diplomatic negotia
tions, and his statement to the commit
tee, approved by the Secretary, leaves the
way clear for the bill so far as our diplo
matic relations' with the Central Ameri
can countries are concerned. It was first
found at the State Department by Sena
tor Morgan that the negotiations, with
Costa Rica can be concluded at the con
venience of the United States and without
any disagreement as to details. The sec
ond basis of negotiations with Costa Rica
and Nicaragua conforms .to the canal
rights and privileges referred to in tho
treaty ratified between the United States
and Great Britain, viz., a perpetual lease
of the canal belt from ocean to ocean,
with the right-on the part of the United
States to construct, own, control, manage
and protect the canul and to collect and
appropriate all tolls and income of the
canal for the benefit of 'the United States
in the belt six miles wide. . This belt may
be increased during the construction to a
Â¦ width of ten miles at the option of the
United States. Third, for the lease, rights
and privileges granted the United States
will pay Costa Rica $1,000,000 ninety days
after the ratification of the treaty and
after that $10,000 annually. The , United
States will pay Nicaragua $6000 without
any additional stipend. \.
' The protocols agreed to and signed in
December, 1900, by the United States,
Costa Rica and Nicaragua, remain with
out alteration or dissent on the part of
the governments named. â¢ â¢

in band, and dealt him six blows-. After
the first blow Harris attempted to rise
from his chair and thus received cuts
from his breast to his abdomen. Al
though badly wounded, he grappled his
antagonist and fought until assistance
arrived.
Seizing an iron bar, Miller dealt Thomp
son a vicious blow over the head, felling
him instantly. Turning around to where
his coat was hanging, he took a knife out
of his pocket and then rushed through the
door into an adjoining room, where Har
ris and others were sitting down at work.
The man who did the killing is Frank
Miller. Jeremiah Harris is the name of
tho victim. Miller had been negligent in
his work, thereby necessitating more la
bor on the part of Harris and another
convict " named Ortiz. These two men
complained to the convict boss, Ernest
Thompson, for several days about Miller's
work, and Thompson reprimanded him.
This morning Harris objected to doing
so much pf Miller's work, whereupon
Thompson went to Miller and informed
him that the kind of labor he was per
forming would not be permitted. Milter
demanded to know who said he was not
doing his share of the work. The convict
boss mentioned Harris and Miller became

consideration of twelve of the twenty
seven pages of the bill. No amendments
were adopted. The principal portion of
the general debate to-day was devoted to
the discussion of the appropriation for

his reasons for his theory that Cuba is
now under the sovereignty of the United

Debates in the House.
Hanna went on to say. that. Berry had
urged that the enormous power and in
fluence of Morgan â¢ . and his associates
would be brought to bear on Congress to
secure the admission of the foreign-built
vessels to American register. That was
gratuitous. If it were true, this bill
would offer little inducement to thoae
owners, as by having their vessels
brought under American register they
would participate in the very profitable
coastwise trade- of the United States..
Perkins of California, a member of the
Commerce Committee, made an extended
speech in support of the pending measure.
He believed it. was the duty of the coun
try . to try the experiment proposed. If
it prove to be a failure it couid be re
pealed by Congress, but he was satisfied
that in its operation it would be a great
success. Every American citizen, he said,
was interested either directly or indi
rectly in the bill. He was satisfied it will
be as far reaching in Its good results as
any piece of legislation that had been
before Congress for many years. As a
shipping" man, Perkins pointed out that
the proposed subsidy, or differential, as
he preferred to call it, would not "begin
to pay one-half of the operating expenses
of the ship," therefore, he maintained,
the criticism of the measure because it
did not contain the provision of the bill
of last year that a vessel must carry at
least 50 per cent of her cargo capacity In
order to participate in the subsidy, could
not be operated except at a loss, and
"Yankees are not- in the habit of doing
business In that way."
Could 1 Get Coastwise Trade.
"To" say," declared Hanna, with some
warmth, "that the Senators on this side
ol the chamber who are favoring this
measure" are thereby fostering a power to
build up a monopoly or to favor any syn
dicate is unfair. If a newspaper report
is to beÂ» taken as-proof to sustain the
statements that have been made it is
hardly worthy of consideration. Not one
ton of these foreign-built vessels, if pur
chased by Americans, could be admitted
to American register or receive any bene
fit under the ship subsidy bill and no one
knows that better than the Senator from
Arkansas." â¢
Hanna replied to" some of the Â¦ polntq
made by Berry and" a brief colloquy en
sued, participated , in byTHanna, â¢ Beri-y,

WASHINGTON, March 13.â After ' the
passage of a considerable number of un*
objected bills to-day the Senate resumed
consideration of the ship subsidy measr
ure. Berry of Arkansas, ! a member of

the bill, made a. vigorous argument in op
position'to it.. : , Â¦Â¦ : Â¦Â¦â¢; . "
In the Senate to-day Penrose favorably
reported the Mitchell-Kahn Chinese ex
cluslbn bill and it was placed on the
calendar.
Actual work on the bill began at the
afternoon cession. The first nine pages,
including the important exclusion sec
tions, were approved with a few verbal
changes. The part approved also covers
the provisions preventing Chinese labor
ers from going to the Philippines or from
coming from the Philippines to this coun
try. The action of the committee on the
exclusion section was practically unani
mous. The remainder of the bill, yet to
be passed upon, covers administrative de
tail. Â»o that the action to-day insures the
report of the Mitchell-Kahn exclusion
measure with amendments clearly re
stricting It to Chinese laborers.
WASHINGTON, March 13.-The House
Committee on Foreign Affairs to-day
voted against considering the bill of Rep
resentative Sherman of New York con
tinuing the existing Chinese exclusion act
and then voted to proceed by continuous
sessions with the consideration - of the
Mitchell-Kahn rigid exclusion . measure,
having the Indorsement of the Pacific
Coan Senators and Representatives in
Congress. The vote against the Sherman
bill in understood to have been 6 to 7.
When this measure was laid aside there
â¢was general concurrence on going on with
the Mitchell-Kahn bill. The actual work
on this bill by sections began this after
noon and Is likely to proceed, uninter
ruptedly until results are secured.

Emperor William's squadron anchored
in the Weser this afternoon, having cir
cumnavigated the island of Heligoland in
a vain attempt to land. Disembarkation
was prevented by the high seas.
Emperor William has received the fa

has discussed with him a project to
deepen the channel of the Weser.
Herr Wiegrand. general director of the
North German Lloyd line of steamships,
who arrived from. New York to-day, has
been invited by the Emperor to meet him
at Bremerhaven to-morrow and sLccorn

his Majesty desires to team the result of
the recent Â«UÂ»*mshlp negotiations at Nfw

between the Emperor. Herr Wiegand and

Ho Mid that personally hÂ» was thorough

The emigrant traffic of the North Ger
man Lloyd Company to New York Is so
heavy that it has compelled this company
to charter the steamship Batavia from
the Hamburg-American line to take 2000
emigrants to New York next Saturday.
This report has reached the American
embassy here. The members of Emperor
William's suite, however, declare these
arrangements to be uncertain. I It is
thought that the Emperor wishes to havÂ«
the first long talk with Prince Henry and
that this can be most comfortably ob
tained before the latter lands.
BERLJN. March 13.â Emperor William,
on board the battleship Wilhelm II, ana
accompanied by two or three other war

BOSTON, March 13.â Through the
united . efforts of representatives of the
great mercantile bodies of the city, sec
onded by the chief executives of the city
in conference with the recognized leaders
of organized labor, tire great strike of
freight handlers and kindred trades rep
resented in the Allied Freight Transporta
tion Council was broken to-night. Fully
20,000 men, who have been idle for four
days, will, go to work in the morning.
This result was attained at a confer
ence this evening at the office of Gov
ernor Crane. Tho decision was at once
reported to the Allied Freight Transport
ation Council at a special meeting to
night and unanimously Indorsed.
Tho settlement was the result of an ex
pressed determination of Governor Crane
and those representing the merchants of
Boston to bring all possible pressure to
bear upon the New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railway Company to adopt the
rules in {prce upon the Boston and Maine
Railroad, forbidding freight handlers to
unload teams except at their own option
and risk... .
All of the old men for whom places can
bo found will be Uikon back by the.rail
roads to-morrow, but owing to the sud
dennesH with which the utrlke was ended
and the largo number of new men who
have been Installed, it Is likely that many
of the old employes will find no vacancies
ready for them to-morrow. Eventually,
It Is believed, they all will regain tH'.ir
old positions.

Kidney Remedy, Swamp-Root.
DR. KI1.MER & CO., Blnghaxnton. Nl T. Vlnt Â° n ' l0Wa ' July "*'
Gentlemenâ In the summer of 1833, I was taken violently 111. My trouble be-
gan with pain In my stomach and back, 10 severe that It teemed as If knives
were cutting me. I was treated by two of thÂ© best physicians In the county.
and consulted another. None of them suspected that the cause of my troublo
was kidney disease. They all told mo that I had cancer of the stomach, and
would die. I grew so week that I could not walk any more than a child a.
month old. and I only weighed sixty pounds. Oue day my brother saw In a
paper your advertisement of Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy. He bought
me a bottle at our drug store *nd I took it. My family could see a chanee in
me. for the better, bo they obtained more and I continued the use of Swamo-
Root regularly. I was so weak and run down that it took considerable tini*
to build me up again. I. am now well, thanks to Swamp-Root, and weigh 141
pounds, and am keeping house for my husband and brother on a farm. Swamp-
Root cured me after the doctors had failed to do me a particle of good.
(Gertrude Warner Scott.)
Â¦Women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease Is not cor-,
rectly understood; In many cases when doctoring they are led to believe that
womb trouble or female weakness of some sort is responsible for their ills,
when In fact disordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing trouble.-'.
The mild and extraordinary effect of the world-famous kidney and bladder
remedy, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, is soon realized. It stands the highest for itÂ»'

Of San Francisco, as much so as the Park

It was stated by A. E. Acklom that
several months ago Frank Ellsworth pre
f^nted a petition for a public /golf course
to the Park Commissioners, but no ac
tion was taken upon it. Park Commis
sioner R. H; Lloyd has been approached
on the subject and has expressed himself
ay willing to consider any plan presented
on its merits. A committee consisting of
Frank Ellsworth, A. E. Acklom and H. C.
Golcher was appointed to consult Super
intendent- McLaren about a suitable site
for links and to prepare an estimate of
the probable cost, to be laid before the
Commissioners. S. L. Abbot Jr. prom
ised to give assistance to the committee.
After a suitable location has been found
Robert Johnstone, the resident profes
sional of the San Francisco Golf Club,
will be asked to prepare a plan showing
the -position of each of the nine" holes.
The committee will report to a meeting
which will be held at 4 p. m. next Thurs

G0LFEES HOPE TO GET .
A COURSE IKT THE PARK
The bitter feeling which has^ for some
time past been brewing between the med
icos and dentals of the Affiliated Colleges
culminated yesterday, when the medical
students, entered the dental college and
wrecked the furnishings, leaving it with
the appearance of having been visited by
a cyclone. A feeling of enmity started
between the two rival colleges some time
ago, when the medical students staked
their goats out in front of the dental
building. The tooth-pluggers immediate
ly resented having these wandering, blat
tering embellishments adorn their cam
pus. They further feared disease, as the
goats had been Inoculated with the bac
teria of â¢ tuberculosis, smallpox, typhoid
fever and other 'dread diseases, in order
that the wielders of the dissecting knife
might study the effects produced by these
different maladies. The dentals painted
the goats blue and gold and removed
them from their favorite feeding ground
to the back of the "Veterinary College. In
retaliation the medicos one day last week
placed the goats in the halls of the dental
college, where they succeeded . in parta
king of a most appetizing repast in the
form of forceps, rubber dam and artifi
cial dentures before they were finally dis
lodged from their point of vantage by the
timely arrival of Janitor Douglas and his
bicom. . : .
Not satisfied, however, with their work
of revenge, the "unknown dead butchera"
entered the- College of Dentistry some
time last night and tore some ten or
twelve doors from their hinges, smashed
benches and destroyed all that came in
their reach, leaving the building- in a
dilapidated condition.
The dentals are wroth at the act of van
dalism committed by their rivals and
swear that the clock on the medical build
ing shall lose its nands.
The dental faculty are very much ln-
censed on account of the damage dona
tbeir building, and if the culprits are
found it will go hard with them. The
faculty is determined to demand repara
tion of the medical students. A peaceful
termination of the lamentable trouble be
tween the two' colleges 1Â» anxiously look
ed for by the heads of each.
William Sproule and E. O. McCormick
of this city are going to join J. C. Stubb*
at El Paso, and they will leave -the lat
tcr part of this week for Texas. It J3
supposed that Harriman ha3 ordered;
these three officials to inspect the prop
erty and road of. the El Paso and Nortii
eastern Railway and will await their re
port.
Both Sproule and McCormick refuse to
discuss the object of their trip to meet
J. C. Stubbs. They merely say that they
arc anxious to meet Mr. Stubbs, and that
they will travel with him until he reaches
California.
It Is stated that Harriman is anxious
to buy this railroad for the purpose of
competing more strongly with the Santa
Fe for Southern California business.
Should . Harriman buy the El Paso and
Northeastern Railway and send passen
gers over the Rock Island from Chicago
t'ne route to Los Angeles would be four
hours shorter than the fastest Santa Fe
California limited that is now running
out of Chicago.
The I report that J. C. Stubbs, director!
of traffic for the Harriman roads, will ba
at El Paso next week .has given rise ta
the : rumor that Harriman will absorb tha

HARRIMAN AFTER
ANOTHER LIKE
" Should the Supervisors confirm the se
Â¦Jecttprv of-the Justices, the new clerk will
iind Powel Fredrick in the way. Fred
rick says that he will make a flght to hold
the office to which Mayor Schmitz ap
pointed him and that he will not give it
Tip until he secures a decision of" the Su
â¢'preme Court. In the meantime Auditor
Uaehr will not affix his signature to any
r ealary warrants coming from the office
-of clerk to the Justices of the Peace.
- Justfces" Clerk Powel Fredrick removed
James. Jtoxburgh and George Aubertine
â¢ yesterday from their positions as deputies
in ,th.e- office. Fredrick says the men were
i;.i<i off on account of lack of work, but
U Is known ' that the removals have a
political significance. Roxburgh and Au
bertine are charged with stirring up strife
in the Union Labor party against Mayor
Schmitz because they were not provided
with better positions. â¢ .
- The conlÂ«rcnce held yesterday, between
;Uayor Schmitz. the Justices of the Peace
Cand Supervisors Wynn, Bent and Comte
Â¦left the question of the selection of a
clerk to the Justices in statu quo.
Although Mayor ; Schmitz and the
Justices desired the conference to be an'
ojten one, the Supervisors objected and
the meelins was executive. -â¢ â¢
The Mayor asked the Justices if they
-would indorse Powel Fredrick, who now
liolds office as Justices' clerk, and In
this manner settle the- difficulty. The
/Justices .replied that while Fredrick
.migHt be' a competent man' in every re
Â¦;*pect, they could cct select his name for
"tJie clerkship, and so long as good men
could be found in the Republican party
they'-would stand for no other selection.
The Supervisors had no suggestion to
offer and the conference ended without
-anything being accomplished.
The Justices informed Mayor Schmitz
'thafkhey will endeavor to come to a de
. cison as to the selection of a candidate
Â£or the clerkship before the meeting of
the Board of Supervisors next Monday
afternoon. The contest has narrowed
down to George S. McComb. former dep
uty in the Justices' clerk's office; Richard
Welsh, deputy County Clerk, and Robert
ex deputy clerk of the Justices.
: Two at the Justices favor "Welsh and
Jwo afe for McComb. while Dennis is a
second choice of two of the Justices. The
.various .candidates are using every effort
to secure fhe "support of three of the
Justices, and It is generally felt in po
litical -circles that Welsh will be selected

Â¦confirmation.
The San Francisco Athletic Club was
granted a permit to hold an amateur con
test on March 28, and to the Ariel Rowing
Club for April 3.
The, athletic club that secures the bbx-r
ing contest between Jeffries ami Fitzsim
mons -will be required to contribute â¢ a
substantial amount to some charitable in
stitution or . public improvement . before
obtaining the required . permit from, tho
Board of Supervisors to hold the exhibi
tion. This much was decided yesterday
by<the Police Committee, which consid
ered the applications of the Twentieth
Century ana the San Francisco Athletic
clubs, both of which desire to promote
the, bi>j contest in' May.
After hearing the respective claims of
the two clubs through "Jack" Gleason
and "Alec" Greggains, Supervisor Curtis
proposed a. resolution which: was adopted
by the committee for recommendation to
the board that the rpermit for the month
of. May be given to the club that gives
the most money to a public charity or to
some public improvement in a sum not
less than $5000, to be paid before the per
mit is granted. Supervisor Curtis said
the exhibition would draw, at least $i5.000
in sate receipts, and it was but just that
thÂ» club securing so valuable a- privilege
should contribute "to the public good. '
The application of the- Bay City .Ath
letic Club for a permit to give an ama
teur exhibition was laid over for one
week. A communication was read from
the Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union to the effect that the club
had violated the rules by matching-non
registered amateurs and professionals at
its last exhibition. Action was postponed
to hear the result of the investigation of
the club by the board of governors of the
association, which is to be held in the
Olympic Club to-night.

be raised yesterday from 15 per- cent to "5
per cent; The Red Rock left the Fraser River
105 days agg for London. The finding of a life
buoy and some cases of salmon some time ago
soon after she sailed sent up her reinsurance
rate to 50 per cent. . No further evidence of

1 It is not presumed that you have noticed how our hat
U department has grown, as the growth has been so grad-
I ual. Steadily the increase has been made, until to-day we
I carry the largest stock of hats in San Francisco (queS'
J tioning ; possibly one exclusive store). This rise of the
I department is^ due to two things:; The good values we
H offer and the lafge assortment of the goods. We have
g whatever a man wants, at whatever he wants to pay.
E : Among bur leading values is a' line of hats at $1.95.
H They come in Derbys, colors â black, brown, cedar and
j| oxford gray; also Pan- Americans, Fedoras, Alpines,
i Graecos and Dunlap Crushers, colors â black, cedar, ox-

DIPLOMATIC . TROUBLES.
Upon the fall of Pauncefote the learned and illus
trious Dr. von Holleben rose to eminence above all
the diplomatists at the capital. It was he /who punc
tured Pauncefote's swelling pride, and it was he,
â¢ Â¦ /
There was the Pauncefote case. A very sad one it
was and is. The old gentleman, venerable for his
years as well as for his services, was on the verge of
retiring from office. He was holding the position of
Dean of the Diplomatic Corps at Washington and
was looked upon as the man who had saved the-
United States from an attack on the part of com
bined Europe. Suddenly there came a rumor that he
was not the only friendly pebble on the diplomatic
beach at the time of the outbreak of the Spanish war.
The rumor grew from more to more. Pauncefote
was .silent, but Germany was not. It was revealed that
the noble Briton had tried to get the powers to sign
a joint note remonstrating with the United States:
Pauncefote has nothing to say. It is announced he
is to seek rest at Biltmore.
HIGH diplomacy at Washington has its trou
bles. The calm and serene gentlemen whom
long experience has taught to conceal emo
tion beneath a placid face, and to conceal thought by
a multiplicity of words, may go to and from council
rooms to pink teas with smiling lips and bland coun
tenances, but all the same they are not happy. There
are troubles which cannot be hidden even in the
deeps of diplomatic hearts, which court dress cannot
wholly conceal nor plumed hats cover effectually
"Die Lotos Blume" was superbly sung
yesterday afternoon with a tranquil and
tender grace that shaped the lovely song
into loveliest form. Again Mrs. Fisk
showed . . her intimate sympathy with
Saint-Saens' genius in -."La Cloche,"
a beautiful" song, but rarely heard
here or anywhere. ' "The ' North
ern Day," a charming lyric by Chadwick.
was also . beautifully given, showing the
rich depths of the singer's lower voice to
splendid advantage. "The Lass With the
Delicate Air," a quaint old English ditty,
was delightfully conceived, the delicate
extravagance and affectation being pic
tured with that fine humor that Is not
the least of Mrs.' Fisk's many attractions.
The song rather belongs to the soprano
kingdom, however.
A group of five lighter jsongs, three of
them hardly worthy- the effort, of J the
artist, closed the programme. To-night's
programme includes a set of five "Biblical
songs" by Dvorak, the Beethoven "Crea
tion Hymn" and a couple of Brahms'
numbers. - * Â¦ " ': .
Mrs. Katharine Flsk's second song re
cital, given at Sherman-Clay Hall yes
terday afternoon, attracted a notable au
dience of musicians and lovers of song.
The fame of the' charming singer has
gone abroad and each concert will doubt
less see sincerest of compliments to an
artistâ larger and yet larger houses. Mrs.
Fisk is more likable, admirable with each
hearing. Her voice grows on one and her
rendering of every, additional number
adds to the wonder* aroused by her ver
satility. Perhaps this is the singer's most
notable distinction, a quick and vivid sym
pathy with the soul of every song she
sings, each phase and mood of it, from
"Die Lotos Blume" of Schumann. to the
quaint merriment of "The Gingerbread
Man."
From an industrial and a commercial point of view
the geographical position of the State is going to be
materially changed by the construction of the isth
mian canal and by the continued reduction in freight
rates, which will bring us into close relations with the
East and with Europe. The development of our oil
wells will supply the cheap fuel that has been lacking.
Agriculture and mining will hardly hold in the future
1 their relative rank among the industries of the State
Consequently the four conditions which have limited
our manufacturing enterprises in the past will not be
the same in the future. It is, therefore, reasonable
to expect the next census to show a development of
manufacturing industry unprecedented in the State.
What we have done has been creditable, but it is as
nothing to what we may expect to do.
Commenting upon the significance of the figures
the bulletin states: "Four important conditions have
limited the growth of manufactures of California and
have determined in a large measure the particular
lines established. These are the geographical posi
tion of the State, the high rate of wages, the high
price of fuel and the exceptional attractions offered
by mining and agriculture."
In addition to what the bulletin refers to as "man
vfactures proper," there are a considerable number
of establishments carrying on what are termed "hand
trades." The distinction shows a curious evolution
of language, because originally the word "manufac
ture" was adopted into the language for the express
purpose of signifying "hand trades," as distinguished
from the factories operated by machinery. Taking
the terms, however, aj custom has fixed their usage,
we had in 1900 of hand trades and manufactures to
gether 14,166 establishments, with a total capital of
$212,640,144, employing 93,356 wage earners, of whom
6836 were engaged in hand trades. The total wages
paid during the year was $48,709,123. The aggregate
value of products is given at $305,519,043, but it is ex
plained that this is the gross value, and as the fin
ished product of one factory is often the raw mate
rial of another, the value of the former reappears in
the statement of the latter, and consequently the
original cost of certain materials may be included
several times in the gross value. It is estimated that
the net value of the products for the year was about
$I7S425 ? 388, which represents the increase on the
value of raw material resulting from the various pro
cesses of manufacture.
In 1850 there were 1003 manufacturing establish
ments, with a total capital of $1,006,197; in i860 the
number of establishments had increased to 8468 and
the capital to $22,043,096. By 1870 the number of
factories had diminished to 3984, but the amount of
capital represented lÂ»y them had increased to $39,
728,202. In 1880 the establishments numbered 5885
and the aggregate capital was $61,243,784. In 1890
the number of factories had further advanced to 7923,
while the capital had swollen to $146,797,102. In 1900
the census shewed 12,582 factories, with a capital of
CENSUS BULLETIN No. 136 gives the man
ufacturing statistics of California from 1850
to 1900, and considering that California is
mainly an agricultural and mining State, the figures
make quite a creditable showing. During the period
under review the population of the State increased
from 92,597 to 1,482,179, while the average number of
wage earners employed in manufacturing establish
ments increased from 3964 to 91,047. Thus while the
population increased a little over 1500 per cent the
number of factory hands increased over 2196 per
cent.

"To have been associated with you during

indeed no empty honor, and tfye pleasure of
serving under an officer so able and at the
same time so considerate and courteous to
all under you as you have always been will
never be foreotten by us.
We wish you health, happiness anJ pros
perity in the future, and trust all your under
takings may result as successfully as has your
management of the United States army trans

The presentation was made by Captain
THE local officials of the United
States army transport service yes
terday presented Brigadier General
Oscar F. Long, the retiring gen
eral superintendent, with a han]
some hammered silver loving cup, upon
which was engraved a suitable farewell
inscription. Accompanying the cup was
a leather-bound album, suitably Inscribed
and containing the names of the twenty
four officials representing the executive
staff of the army dock.
General Long accepted the token with
brief thanks. He spoke of the loyal
service of his associates and said that
without their co-operation he could not
have brought his efforts here to such suc
cessful conclusion.
The Inscription on the cup reads;
"Presented to Brigadier General O. F.
Long, general superintendent army trans
port service, as a token of esteem, af
fection and high appreciation of his
sterling character by the dock officials
serving under him at the United States
army transport dock, March 1, 1902."
The first page of the album containing
the names of the officials is engrossed
v/ith the following:
To General Oscar F. Long*. "We,. the under
signed officers and employes of the United
States army transport service, who have had
the honor of serving under you since the in
auguration of the Eervlce on April 1, 1890. de
sire to express our sincere congratulations on
your promotion to a higher office, and at the
same time to convey to you the feeling of re
spect and admiration which your many ster
ling qualities as an officer and our command
er has engendered. To whatever sphere your
duties as an officer of the United States army
may call you, there you will be followed by
our affectionate regard and esteem.
Such is the utterance of, the voice of Humboldt,
and now if any one wish to take up the challenge
or find a home where all is bright, beautiful and
blooming, let him go to Humboldt and see for him
self whether it will be saner to take up. the challenge
and fight.it out or accept the situation and make a
home in a land where the soil is rich, the climate
beneficent, the people prosperous, the future, golden,
and the Standard waving on the outer- wall in defiance
to foes and encouragement to friends.
V All of that is true, but the fact that Humboldt does
not need advertising is no reason why The Call
should overlook her claims or fail. to do her justice.
Nor, indeed, have we ever intentionally done so. We
know, she "sends us five millions a' year in products
and is still on the map as a part of Northern Califor
nia," and we gladly give place to the statement of the
Standard: "Our hill lands, capable of producing the
finest orchards, are being taken by the homesteader,
and there are hundreds of quarter sections on which
a family can, make a good living and enjoy a climate
that neither blisters one in summer nor freezes him
in winter; -which is mild, healthful, invigorating, glo
rious. It is well that all the Eastern people do -not
know how much better, easier, happier they might
live and dit here than in the East, where winter's cold
freezes them and summer's heat blisters them, where
blizzards and cyclones plague the people and destroy
human life.' If they knew it as well as we do we
should be overrun with home-seekers and literally
crowded with population." â¢ "
It must not be supposed that this gallant flinging
of the Humboldt Standard to the breeze was done
in any defiance of The Call. No such motive animat
ed the hand that waves it. With a judicious spirit it
says: ',The Call is right in trying to wake up the
people to do something for Northern California. All
it says tof this section is true; it might have included
Humboldt in its plea for recognition, and it .could
have said as much for us as for any other county
mentioned. We can console ourselves, however, for
the -oversight by the thought that we do not need
advertising so much as a large portion of the country
mentioned by The Call. Our amazing resources will
in due time, advertise themselves, 'as they are now
coming to the attention of Eastern settlers and East
ern capitalists more and more each year."
There is no telling how many people Humboldt
could support. With good railroad and steamship
communications Humboldt Bay could support as
many people on its borders as San Francisco Bay,
and the county could be relied upon to feed them
on strawberries and cream. Nor would they ever
lack for meat, for our contemporary says: "When
the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys are parched
with heat, Humboldt's valleys are green and great
herds of cattle and flocks of sheep are fattening on
their succulent grasses."
Our contemporary goes on to say: "Humboldt is
capable of supporting a population ten times as large
as it now has." - Hardly any one will be bold enough
to dispute that proposition. . In ; fact, it has all the
force of a cunning under estimate intended to give
verisimilitude to alj the claims that precede and fol
low it. The world will say: "If the Standard is so
modest in this claim, how can it be suspected of ex
aggeration in anything else?"
Superlatives are dangerous and. we do not know
how the claim of superiority over any other county
could be maintained, nor exactly what qualifications
are meant by the phrase "strictly agricultural land,"
but we have no doubt that, judged by the Humboldt
standard of such things, the whole claim is true. S'an
Joaquin, Santa Clara or Placer standards of agricul
tural values may lead to different conclusions; but
they must speak for themselves. It is the Humboldt
challenge that is thrown to the world in the statement
quoted, and the world must meet it on the terms of
the challenger.
After paying a tribute to Northern California gen
erally, and conceding the high merits of each partic
ular section of it, the Standard says: "Humboldt has
richer and more productive valleys, as fertile and pic
turesque foothills and a wider diversity of industry
than any county The Call mentions in that editorial.
One good acre of Eel River or Arcata bottom land is
worth more than any acre in any county named, as
strictly agricultural land."
SOME days ago .The Call, ..in reviewing the
movement now going on for the advancement
of Northern California, pointed out the advan
tages of the San Joaquin and the. Sacramento valleys
and of the rich counties in the foothills and the
mountains that overlook them. In the course of
the review several of the counties of those sections
of the State were named in order to give definiteness
to the general description. In the list of names that
of Humboldt did not appear. It was a fortunate
omission, for it has given the Humboldt Standard an
occasion to speak for that county in a voice uttering
veracities with the vim and vigor of native eloquence.
THE VOICE OF HUMBOLDT.
If the courts keep on in their industrious course of
declaring invalid vital sections, of the city charter
that interesting municipal instrument will soon con
sist chiefly of holes, with hardly frame enough to
hold its nothingness in evidence.
There is no power to enforce the supreme law in
Colorado. The Sheriff of the county most concerned
is the president of the boycotting organization. He
will not call on the Governor for help as Sheriff to
enforce a law which, as chief boycotter, he has or
dered to be violated. Without that call the Governor
cannot act, and without his action the Federal Gov
ernment is silent. Therefore the condemnation of
the Chinese to die of famine and thirst must succeed.
Succeeding there, the example of Colorado may be
and will be everywhere followed at once and with im
punity, and it will be demonstrated that while we
build a navy to protect the national honor abroad we
are powerless to defend it at home. Therefore let us
surrender a covenant which we cannot keep.
We are perfectly aware that the prejudiced and the
thoughtless will regard it as an indifferent thing that
our people are permitted at will to strike down their
own supreme law and at the same time disown our
international obligations. But these acts- follow so
closely upon the cruel punishment of China for do
ing the same thing, even when she had only resisted
a forgery, that they must impress all of our fellow
citizens who choose to have a conscience and to un
derstand and respect the requirements of national
honor. All such will agree with us that if the treaty
cannot be enforced at home we should abrogate it and
abandon the commercial advantages it secures for us
in China. Anything is better than national dishonor.
Rather not a penny of trade; rather our ships rot at
anchor; rather the producers of pur export surplus
left with it to decay in the warehouse than that we
be written down a nation that will not keep its cove
nants.
By the constitution of the United States a treaty
is made the supreme law of the land, with the same
vigor as the constitution itself. This treaty with
China. is the supreme law; as much as a treaty with
Great Britain or an act of Congress. We may not
concern ourselves about the sufferings of the Chi
nese. But we may well concern ourselves about .the
power of our Federal Government to enforce its su
preme law and keep its public faith. If it cannot en
force its treaty with China we are clear that the treaty
should be abrogated and the commercial advantages
which it secures to us should be given up. ' Better the
voluntary surrender of every dollar of gain to our
commerce than to be known as a nation that will
not % keep faith. The one only destroys profit. The
other destroys honor.
We are all familiar with the violations' of these
rights and the nullification of that treaty. There are
places in this country where Chinese are not per'
mitted domicile or vocation, where they are killed if
they refuse to move en. The dead line in most of
these communities Was established before Christen
dom by fire and sword compelled China to respect a
forgery in a treaty. But since that occurred the Chi
nese who are lawfully here, whose rights rest in the
treaty, are being denied their enjoyment. In Colo
rado they are being expelled. A boycott has been
put in force by which they are denied shelter, food
and water. In the mountain towns of that State,
where the water as well as the food supply can both
be cut off, this rigid boycott has so terrorized the
merchants who supply food and the companies that
control the potable water that after several months'
resistance they have been compelled to surrender,
and the Chinese, many of them unable to escape, are
condemned to die of hunger and thirst.
This issue first comes home to the United States.
For our troops in China, it must be said that they
avoided the excesses of others, and for our Govern
ment that it took a course honorable and humane.
But now an issue is made , involving the power of
this country to keep its treaties. We do not hark
back to the beginning of our treaty relations with
that empire. It is history that when the Burlingame
immigration treaty was made it was celebrated by
joyful formalities in California. By its several amend
ments its terms have been restricted until it author
izes the exclusion of Chinese, but it still preserves
all the rights it originally conferred upon Chinese
who entered under it and have remained in this coun
try. By our pledged word in the treaty such Chinese
have the right of mobility throughout this country,
the right of domicile here and the right of peaceful
residence and pursuit of a vocation.
But Christendom professes the Golden Rule. It
has compelled China to discharge her international
obligation, to keep even a forgery in a treaty. Will
Christendom keep its openly made treaties with
China?
IN violation of treaty rights, though the same
rested on a forgery in the French treaty of i860,
the Chinese rose against the presence of white
men in the Middle Kingdom. In this revolt , 125
white people lost their lives and others were subject
ed to great hardships. In retaliation the Western
nations sent a combined military expedition to
China and inflicted upon that people the most cruel
and complete, the most harrowing and inhuman pun
ishment since Hyder AH ravaged the" Carnatic. Mur
der, arson, outrage and robbery left North China
soaked with blood and smitten by famine. Fleets
were laden with the loot of hovel and palace, of the
magazine and treasury. The Chinese were taught
that even forgery in a treaty must be respected as a
binding international obligation, and their punish
ment and humiliation were the subject of rejoicing in
all Christendom. Â¦ 1

Of course the stories told about Holleben will not
be widely credited. Discharged employes who go
about telling office secrets may always be looked
upon with suspicion. In nine cases out of ten their
stories are the result of spite, and even when they
have some foundation they, are generally gross exag
gerations. It is bad for Holleben, however, that this
story struck the country just when he longed for rest.

Corinthians Raise Annual Dues.
ilege and Spoke upon It at some length,
but the chair ruled that the matter could
not be taken up at a special meeting
called for a particular purpose. Secretary
J. C. Brickell announced that the result
af the mail vote on the question of amend
ing the by-laws to raise the annual dues
from $12 to $15 was as follows: 175 in favor
of and 11 against the amendment. Commo
dore Sager declared the amendment car
ried and the meeting adjourned.
The bettors seem to like Gibbs* chances,
as he has been Installed favorite at odds
of 10 to 8. The flght is expected to prove
an exciting affair. Gibbs lost a lot of
prestige in his bout with Jack O'Brien,
and although he has won two minor fights
since then he has not entirely re-estab
lished himself In the favor of sporting
men.
He complained of being down too low in
weight when he foughfO'Brien as an ex
cuse for his poor showing. If he wins
handily to-night this explanation will
seem plausible. He says he is in the best
possible condition and will have no ex
cuse to offer on that score:
La Fontise has fought his way to the
front in Montana, where the sporting men
claim him as their own. He is a rugged
fighter and will give Gibbs a hard argu
ment. He has been training at Blanken's
and has made every hour tell in his pre
paratory work.
The preliminaries will be between Jack
Kane and Jimmie Reilly, "Kid" Lavell
and Bonar Wilt. A large delegation will

The charge against J. Pollard Crowther,
of passing a fictitious check, was dis
missed by Judge Mogan yesterday. The
Judge passed the responsibility of crimi
nal action against J. Morgan Smith, the
insurance agent, who gave the fictitious
check to Crowther, to the District Attor
ney. Smith was absent yesterday, but
Attorney Barnes was in court looking
after his interests. .
Detectives Whitaker and Coleman tes
tified as to Crowther's arrest, and said he
had made statements to them that he
thought the check given him by Smith
was genuine. Attorneys Craig and Van
Fleet made a motion that the case be
dismissed on the ground that no intent
to defraud had been proved. It appeared
to them simply that an attempt on the
part of Landlord Robinson of the Knick
erbocker Hotel to cheaply and expedl
tlously collect a bill.
The Judge said he was inclined to think
from the evidence that all the actions of
the defendant Justified the conclusion
that there was no intent to defraud on !
his part. If the story told by J. Pollard
Crowther and J. Morgan Smith were true,
J. Pollard Crowther had shown himself to
be very gullible for a young man who had
traveled. He had no doubt been gulled by
Smith, but why Smith chose to act as he
did was) something the court could not
understand. It might have been a Joke,
but it was a very serious way of joking.
"I don't understand," continued the
Judge, "why on ten minutes' acquaint
ance In a saloon J. Pollard Crowther
should have accepted a check for $100 from
a stranger, which showed that he is very
gullible. He took the check to Robinson
and let me say | that Robinson's actions
in the matter have been entirely honor
able. I don't think that Crowther in
tended to deceive Robinson, and if he had
been possessed of any criminal instincts
he vrould have sought safety In flight, but
instead he went to another hotel and reg
istered In his own name. All his actions
show that he was an Innocent man

"Cupid" Danforth asked what had be

There will be free transportation for such
exhibits to and from San Francisco. The Su
pervisors may take charge of such exhibits, or
may leave it to a committee of the Knights of
Pythias.
I urge you to go to work at once along these
lines. This is one of the few opportunities
ever offered to a State that has heretofore been
considered as the babk door entrance into the
Union. As your work progresses send frequent
and full reports to this office, also to H.

Attest: H. SCHAFFNER, G. K. of R. and S.
I would suggest that each lodge in the coun
ty appoint a committee of five of its most active
and influential members, and that several dele
gations unite as a general committee to ap
pear together before the Board of Supervisors
at the earliest possible session, and request an
appropriation of a 'suitable sum to establish and
maintain a county exhibit at the headquarters
you may decide upon having, whereby you
may induce a portion of the great throng of
visitors to make California their future home.
Ask your newspaper men. who are always
foremost in advancing the welfare and pros
perity of our State, to co-operate with you in
reaching the end.
Ask your Supervisors to help you out in this
matter. Show them that it is not for your
benefit but for Â¦ the benefit of your entire lo
cality.
'â¢Â¦ Under the law (County Government Act,
section 33), the Supervisors of your county
may make a very generous appropriation "to
aid in or carrying on the work of immigration
thereto, or far the purpose of . exhibiting or
advertising the agricultural, manufacturing or
other resources of the county"; $3000 in some
cases and $2000 in others.
One good w,ay fs to install at your head
quarters in San Francisco an exhibit of the
principal resources and industries of your lo
cality, and - thus command attention.
Urges Making of Exhibits.
Would you like a number of our guests to
visit your locality? If so. why not attract
them? How can this be t done?
Every Knight of California is and of right
should be, interested in the development of the
State's resources. The trail of the conclave of
the Knights Templar in San Francisco in 18S3
found many a pilgrim who came here to par
ticipate in it, a resident of California, and
when the smoke of the campfires of the national
encampment of the G. A. R. in. San Francisco
in 18bl> disappeared there were many strangers
among us wearing the emblem of that order
who- had decided to cast their lot in the land
of the Golden Gate.
How shall we attract them to places other
than San Francisco, where the conventions are
to meet?
Unprecedcntedly low excursion rates from
San Francisco to different interior points are
being arrarged, so that all tourists can at a
minimum cost visit the sections to which they
have b?en attracted.
Last but not least there will convene the
Supreme Temple of the.D. O. K. K. at their
mecea of the Pacific, toward which the eyt:s of
the faithful have, by the teachings of Allah,
been directed for lo, these many moons.
At this great conclave not less than 80,000
people from beyond the confines of California
will attend. The lowest rates of transportation
ever offered have been fixed by the railroad
companies from every section of the United
States. These visitors will largely be people
of means, a great number of whom will un
doubtedly be enchanted by our delightful cli
mate and our varied products, and. make up
their minds to return to our shores to dwell.
At the same time will- commence the Su
preme Assembly of the Uniform Rank of the
order, and it is estimated that from 10.000 to
12,000 Knights loyal In uniform will be present
from outside the State to compete for the $9000
in prizes offered for efficiency in different
lines.
There will also be the Supreme meetings of
the Rathbone Sisters and of the Pythian Sis
ters, the ladies' auxiliaries of our order. .Â«
On the 11th of August will begin in San
Francisco the biennial convention of the Su
preme Lodge of the Knights of Pythias, at
which will be present delegates from every
State and territory of the Union, as well as
from Mexico, the British possessions on this
continent and Hawaii.
â¢ In view of the fact that the Supreme
Lodge of the Knights of Pythias and the
Grand Encampment of the Uniform Rank
of that order will meet In this city next
August, and there will be more than
80,000 strangers here during the week that
the Knights will be. here,' I* S. Calkins
"of Nevada City, the grand chancellor of
the order in California, has been visiting
many of the lodges and stirring them up
to action. He has prepared the following
curcular letter to the lodges, and his dep
uties will send out the same during, the
early part of next week: â¢
NEVADA CITY. Cal., March 14, 1902, Pythian
Period. XXXIX.
To the Subordinate Lodges and Deputy Grand
Chancellor of the Knights of Pythias of the
Grand Domain of California â Brothers: The
coming of August next will mark one of the
greatest epochs in the history of California and
of Pythianism. Never before have the Knights
of this State had such a golden opportunity to
exhibit their loyalty to the order and to this
Western shore. Never in the past have the
Knights and the citizens in general had such
a chance as will be presented to them at that
time to exhibit to a mighty army of visitors the
wonderful and limitless resources of our com
monwealth.

symptoms of rheumatism, neuralgia, dys-
pepsia, kidney troubles and persistent
headaches are attended to when first ex-
perienced, by use of one or two bottles of

? TOO GREAT EXPENSE
Not the Reason.
It is not because Pyramid Pile Cure is
so expensive that many people decline to
give it a trial, but because they find it
too great a tax on their credulity to be-
lieve that the published letters bearing
testimony to the merit of this remedy are
genuine and bona fide; especially to those
who have realized the suffering incident
to piles Is it incredible that any one" who
has been afflicted twenty-five and thirty
years with the worst forms of protruding
and bleeding piles should be cured by the
application of a simple remedy, when
their physician has assured them that the
only relief is in a surgical operation. This
is rightfully viewed' with dread by all
those afflicted, as It means at the least a
great shock to the nervous system, with
more than a possibility of utter collapse
and death; in the majority of cases, too,
there is a return of the complaint, owing
to the fact that the cause is not removed.
The proprietors of Pyramid Pile Cure
agree to forfeit one thousand dollars to
any one who will show a single published
testimonial to be not genuine and unso-
licited; this latter feature is most gratify-
ing, inasmuch as these letters are written
solely out of gratitude and with the hope
that those who are afflicted as the writers
: have been may learn that relief Is at hanl
at a comparatively trifling expense.
Pyramid Pile Cure is for sale by druggists
at 50 cents a package, or will be mailed
by the makers to any address upon re-
ceipt of price.
Mr. Wm. Llchtenwalter, head of the
largest printing-house in Canton, Ohio,
says: "It is with the utmost pleasure and
satisfaction that I can say I believe I am
cured of protruding and bleeding piles,
after suffering more than twenty-rlvd
years. I have been in bed for two week3
at a time. I have not suffered In the
least for over a year, and I used' only
three 50-cent boxes of Pyramid Pile Cure.
.1 advise every person suffering with this
distressing and painful complaint to give
this remedy a trial. I have every confi-
dence in it." Write the Pyramid Drug
Company, Marshall, Mich., for their book
on the causes and cure of piles.

Lggs advanced again yesterday. The situ
ation remains, about as before given, the ad
vance being due to the heavy demand for cold
storage speculation and local retail trade, both
of which are unusually brisk this year. The

was higher than a good many dealers Â¦ asked
on the street. It was talk on the street that

yoked a lively discussion, which resulted in
result of this action was that thÂ«
quotation., of the street and the ex.
change immediately became identical; both
being based on the actual Eales of the dav
regardless of the Interests affected. There are
plenty of Eggs here, but the demand, as juÂ«
Butter Mands about the *am>. Receipts are
free, but the quantity coming In Is about equal
to the quantity going out. hence there Is no
accumulation of stock. Cheese, however Is
weak with accumulating stock?. . The exchange

Captain John Seymour. Chief of the San
Francisco detective force, arrived at 11
o'clock last night from Kansas City,
â¢whither he had gone in the expectation
of capturing the murderer of Nora Fuller.
Ho came through without change, the
car he rode in being attached to train No.
5 at Denver. He occupied a drawing-room,
in the Pullman, alone, save for the pres
ence of tho little grip which has become
famous since his mysterious departure,
and In which he is supposed to carry his
priceless collection of clews.
Captain Seymour was in excellent
health, except for a cold which he
caught In Kansas City. He also caught
the west-bouud train there, but he did
not catch the slayer of Nora Fuller. In
view of this fact there was no great
necessity for him to seek the Hall of
Justice. f=o he went directly to his home.
He had failed to notify the department
of lite arrival, and at police headquarters
last night it was not known that Captain
Seymour had returned. His homecoming
was as quietly accomplished as his de
parture, and his movements are almost
as much of. a mystery as those of the
murderer for whom he is searching.

Mr. Harper was loth to discuss- the
matter, last evening. He stated he was
sorry publicity was given to the affair,
as it would injure Miss Lewis in a meas
ure and also cause some annoyance to
his own family.
It appears that tho relatives of -Miss
Lewis learned of her contemplated mar
riago and sent, her off to Oakland. The
young lady remained there a week, and
on her return declined to meet her fiance
or hold any further communication -with
him. Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦..Â¦
, Mr. Harper is of 'the' opinion that Mr.
Lewis objected to his marrying Miss
Lewis because he was 1 not of the same
faith. Ho can see no other objection, as
he comes of a good family, and Is pos
sessed of sufficient worldly goods to prop
erly support a wife.
The engagement of the young: couple
quickly followed their meeting. They met
in society- and a mutual liking sprang up
between tiieni. Mr. Â¦ Harper asked - Miss
Lewis to be his wife and she accepted
him. He hurried to the County Clerk's
office and procured the necessary license
and asked Superior Judge Hebbard to
marry them. The latter waited in his
chambers for many hours, but the couple
did not come. Â¦

Attorney Charles 11. Snook of the law
firm of 8nook & Church, representing the
new railroad, argued that there was nr.
doubt that the Oakland and East Side
Railroad would absorb the old California
and Nevada road, hence the question of a
po&sible conflict as to franchises could
not arise.
Upon motion a special committee con
sisting of the Ordinance and Judiciary
Committee, Mayor Barstow and City At
torney Johnson was named to meet Mon*
day evening, decide the point and report
to the City Council.
When the petition and ordinance grant
ing the franchises were read this evening
at the meeting of the Ordinance and
Jud?cJary Committee President Louis
SchaiTcr Cf the City Council interpose-J
f;n objection in the form of a legal point.
He called attention to the fact that the
Board of Supervisors had granted the Cal
ifornia and Nevada Railroad a flfty-year
franchise when the right of way was
outside of the municipal limits. Now
that it was within the corporate boun
daries by reason of annexation of terri
tory Mr. Sehaffer was not sure that the
city could grant another franchise during
the life of the previous grant when the
new road was to take the California and
Nevada Railroad's right of way.
A legal question haa been raised con
cerning the right of thÂ« City Council to
felve a franchise to tho Oakland arid East
Side Railroad, which purposes to give
entrance into Oakland for the Atchison,
Topc-ka and Santa Fe Railroad.

Â¦ One of the cleverest among the genre
pictures is the chic little sketch in the
Luxembourg Gardens by B. R. Campbell,
â¢who has some other nice things on the
walls. Helen Hyde has some charming
Japanese designs, and Annie F. Brlggs
and Augusta Graves show" some attrac
tive water colors. There are a few good
miniatures by Lillie V. O. Ryan. Rose t*
Campbell and Oscar Kunath, and sculp
ture is well represented by Arthur Put
nam, A. Le Jetine, Florence Butler and
Gertrude F. Boyle. /
The portrait interest is in the ascend
ant, and there are some striking portraits
to be seen on the walls. Much the best
of, these is Orrin Peck's portrait of Dr.
Martin Kellogg, ex-president of the Uni
versity ,of California, a strongly handled
and v*ry clever piece of work. The am
bitious portrait of; Professor Wheeier by
the same hand is hardly so happy;
nc-ither is that of Mrs. Charles S. Wheeier.
The Sandona portraits attracted a large
snare of attention, that of Mrs. Older be
ing the best example of his work. It is
gracefully drawn and well painted as far
as it goes and is distinctly promising
work, Mrs. iOlga M. Ackerman has a.i
attractive portrait sketch of a child read
ing, and one of a girl . that she calls
"Edna." John A. Stanton has a study,
"Head of Old Breton," that shows char
acter, but is at his best in the charming
"Brittany"- study, a bit. of lovely color,
and the quaint "Study for Picture."
Alice B. Chittenden has an agreeable por
trait of William C. Taylor.
Landscape is not strongly represented
this year. William Keith has twoâ "In
the Forest," distinctly below his usual
standard, and "Mono Pass," beautiful as
only Keith can be in spots, but not evenly
great. Cadenasso has a nice landscape.
"The Pool": Louise M.. Carpenter has a
sunny, Frenchy sketch of "Sand Dunes";
A. W. Best a pleasing sweep of sunlit
country near Mount Tamalpais; Aaron
Altmann a nice turn of a stream. "Sail
ing His New Boat": Annie Harmon a
sincere and pleasant handling Of a marsh
subject; T. H; Thompson a poetic fancy,
"Hazy Moonlight"; G. F. P. Plazzoni a
rich, strong Alameda sketch.

It fell to the fate of "Jimmie" Arguello,.
capitalist, clubman, bon vivant, descend
ant of a hundred dons, to encounter the
burglar, or rather, to catch a tleeting
glimpse of his feet and legs, and the man
ner of that encounter is worthy of the
rigid spirit of good form that permeates
the hotei. Arguello has a suite of rooms
facing on Powell street and he visited them
Wednesday evening to dress for dinner.
He was somewhat surprised at the dis
order apparent in the nrst apartment he
entered.' Bundles of bric-a-brac and silver
ornaments were scattered about the floor
and the room gave evidence of a thorough
ransacking. lie stepped into the bedroom
and as he did he saw a pair of legs dis
appear through the transom. An exami
nation, of the bedroom showed that trunks
and drawers had been emptied of their
contents and numerous bundles 6f valu
'ables tied up preparatory to carrying
them away.
Arguello did not scream or make a
scene of-. any,, kind. Such a proceeding
would have been considered in the worst
possible taste at the Savoy. He did not
even attempt to append himself to the
disappearing legs. He merely picked out
his dinner clothes from the heap of costly
raiment on the floor, set back a few cher
ished photographs into their silver frames
and dressed for the evening. Thfin he
called a bellboy and told him that a
burglar had made a beastly muss of his
apartments and he would like to have
them straightened out.
When the talc of the transom- worker
spread among the guests there was as
near an approach to a flurry as ever
comes to such an assemblage. Burglars
are vulgar, of course, but the immediate
attention of one "of the guild served to
make the subject one of interest. The
hotel ataches stoutly denied the visita
tion, but one of the guests divulged the
story. Arguello thinks he can give a good
description of the soles of the shoes worn
by tho active criminal whom he fright
ened away before profit could be taken
from the plunder.
Post street's aristocratic hostelry, the
Savoy, is hi a ferment of apprehension
over the visit of a burglarious Intruder
into Its upholstered precincts about the
dinner hour Wednesday evening. The un
rest is accentuated by the fact that tho
prowler is still at large. and It is feared
he may appear again. To forestall such
a contingency the safety deposit vaults
were glutted yesterday with the gems and
jewels of the fair women who make the
Savoy their residence and every 'stranger
who visits the hotel Is looked upon as the
possible possessor of a "jimmy" and a
dark lantern.

been drilhd in the embankment and trie
loader had brought up a box containing
twenty-five sticks of triatit powder and a
couple of boxes of fulminating caps for
the purpose of making a blast. Accord
ing to his account somo bystander on the
bank above threw a lighted cigarette into
the powder box, which ignited one of the
sticks. He saw the smoke and realizing
that an explosion would follow shouted
a warning to the. men working near and
ran with all haste down the hill. All
the men managed to reach places ot
safety before the shock came, and by the
merest chance nobody happened to be
pacing- thp danger point at the time.
The conciiFsion shattered every window
light in two houses across the street from
the explosion and broke the front win
dows of five houses farther down the
street. The sidewalks were littered with
broken glass and the inmates of the
dwellings were panic-stricken for an in

doors and the excited throng gathered in
the street to ascertain the cause of the

was injured there was much rejoicing ana

Of Treating Dyspepsia and Stomach Troubles

Many people with weak digestion, as well M .
some physicians, consider the first step to tak*
In attempting to cure indigestion Is to restrict
the diet, either by selecting certain toods and
; rejecting others or to cut down the amount oÂ£
food eaten to barely enough to keep ecul and
body together.' i n other words the starvation
plan Is by many supposed to be the first es-
sential. . .-;;â¢Â«.
All tbis is radically wrong. It is foolish and
unscientific to recommead dieting to a. man al-
ready suffering from starvation because in-
digestion itself starves every organ, nerve and
fiber in the body. .

Eat a sufficient amount of wholesome food -
and after each meal take one or two of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets to promptly digest It. .
In this way the system Is nourished and the
overworked stomach rested, because the tablets
will digest the food whether the stomach works

these tablets In all cas<Â»3 of defective digestion

absolutely free- from animal matter and 'other
imparities, and being pleasant to the tasts
are as safe and harmless for the child as for
the adult.

the trial of Edward Duncan; charged, with
murdering George W. Rice, the non-union
machinist, at Twentieth and -Howard
streets, October 11, by the presence of Er
line L. Piatt, the young girl whose depo
sitions had to be heard at ' the trials of
Buckley, Moran. and Donnelly, because
she was sick in the City of Mexico.
The' girl thoroughly self-possessed
on the witness stand and while giving her
testimony there was a- deathlike stillness
in the courtroom, the jurors leaning, for
.ward.in their seats to catch every word
that f eH from her lips. After detailing
what occurred on\ the . car, she declared
positively. that Buckley was the man who
fired the shots Into Â¦ Rice's* prostrate form

Despite the age of the stranded schoon
er she was' deemed one of the fastest
boats in the lumber business. Her value,
however, does not exceed $10,000 and the
loss is distributed among eight different
companies. One-eighth of the boat' be
longed to the E. K. Wood Lumber Com
pany, which also had the management.
The schooner Reporter was constructed
in Port Ludlow, Wash., in 1876, and was
about 300 tons burden. She was bound to
this port with 400,000 feet of pine lumber,
laths and shakes. The value of het cargo,
which will be almost a total loss, is placed
at. about $5000. This loss will fall en
tirely on the E. K. Wood Lumber Com
pany, as it was uninsured, j
A tug stood oft early In the day, but
found it impossible to reach the schooner
or to send a line aboard her.*.
Wreckers were on hand bright and early
and many a good piece of lumber loosened
from â¢ the deck load and washed ashore
was dragged or hauled away to Carville.
This picturesque little burg by the sea
will have the greatest building boom in
its history within the next fortnight.
The schooner is old and a piece of her
keel and sections of her rail came ashore
before noon. She will certainly go to
pieces within a day or two. Another atÂ»
tempt to get her papers will be made this
morning.
The crew consisted of eight men. all
told, those named above and Seamen E.
Blychert, F. Brinker and C. Paulson.
parted and the Â¦ boat was driven ashore.
When it went out again great difficulty
was experienced in taking off the skipper
and mate and Captain Varney, who had
also. gone aboard. The cabin had been
so wrecked that nothing but - the chroÂ»
nometer was secured as a result of the
venturesome j trip.
All day the wreck was the prize show
of the year. Thousands visited the scene
and not even the biting wind and sudden
squalls could. drive them away. .
Captain Hansen did not report to the
owners, the E. K. Wood Lumber.'Com
pany, during the day, contenting himself
with making an oral report to the man
ager, Robert Irwin, who drove out to the
scene of the wreck.
The schooner was rapidly lifted . inshore
by the breakers, . until she lay starboard
side on less than a hundred yards from
the low water mark.' During the day she
heaved and lurched about until she was
lying almost stern on. -
At 4 o'clock Captain Varney's crew took
Captain Hansen Â¦ and Mate Jorgensen
aboard to Â¦ attempt to recover the ship's
papers and some personal effects. While
they were aboard' the lifeboat's painter
Peter Kaffold, the second ' mate, ' who
was on watch\ until 4 o'clock,, says that
at 1 o'clock tfte schooner was close to
the lightship. He reported to the skipper
that they., were- getting close in. At 4
o'clock he .was. relieved by the first mate,
Maurice Jorgensen. Captain Hansen,
however, was on deck and he ! gave the
order to bring the ship about, but before
it could be executed the schooner was
aground. r
The crew had lowered the sails. The
deck was awash and they had been
driven into the rigging. The mizzen rig
ging gave away soon after the' schooner
struck, the mizzen boom and sail drag
ging overboard into the sea and the mast
tilting to a perilous angle, held there only
by the stanch stays. As the rigging fell
H. Ostergren, one of the sailors, was
thrown to the deck and badly bruised.
Crew Driven Into Rigging.
Captain Smith's crew worked with the
beach apparatus- arid -managed to shoot' a
line aboard. Captain Varney and-his crew
launched a lifeboat, but were swamped by
the heavy seas. A second trial. was more
successful, the boat was steered under
the lee of the starboard side and the crew
was rescued from its perilous position. -

Hotel-Keepers' Feud Settled.,
The feud between boarders In the hoteb
of W. H. Kruger and James Gately at the
Potrero has been declared off. Hugh Jen
nings and John Mullen, two of Kruger" s
boarders, appeared before Judge Mogan
yesterday. Jennings on a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon and Mullen
for disturbing the peace, and Gately's at
torney. Joseph Coffey. said that Gately
refused to prosecute either case, as the
differences had been settled. The cases
were then dismlssd. Warrants are out for
the arrest of Gately and two of h:s
boarders for battery upon Jennings and
Mullen and Coffey asked Judge Cabaniss
to withdraw the warrants, but the Judse
refused and insisted on the parties beinj;
arrested and brought Into court.
When danger suddenly loomed In front
Skipper Hansen tried to bring his boat
about, but it was too late. The strong in-
Bhore set of the current dragged the
schooner on, and she struck directly off
the point where the King Philip was
wrecked, within a stone's throw almost
of the spot where the Olga went ashore
with her cargo of sugar, and within sight
of the cove where the little Neptune drove
upon the sands. . v. .
Captain Hansen at once flashed a light
as a signal of distress. The patrol of the
Golden Gate life-saving station Â¦ returned
the signal and ran 'to give the alarm. Cap
tain Varney and his crew and Captain
Smith and his crew from the south. side
life-saving station hurried to the beach.
Captain Adolph Hansen, the master of
the wrecked vessel, a weather-beaten lit*
tie mariner, who has sailed up and down
the coast for twenty years and never be
fore met with mishap, says that he saw a
strange light in the vicinity of the Cliff
House, which he mistook for Point Bonita
light, and seeing the head of land to the
south, which he thought was South Head,
he let his vessel drive forward under all
but the top canvas, thinking she was
headed into the Golden Gate. A land
haze obscured the shore, and not until the
schooner was in the breakers did he know
he was "trying to hurdle her â¢ over the
peninsula instead of going j in . orderly
through the harbor entrance.
Saw Mysterious Light.
The Reporter sailed from Grays Harbor
on Friday. An hour before she hove an
chor a black cat, the pet of the crew,
leaped overboard and was drowned. The
schooner neared port on the 13th, and
small wonder, say the sailormen, that she
took the bit, in her teeth and I tried .to
make harbor overland. Even the raagc
of her name could not save her from such
a combination of hoodoos.
"When the cat saw' the cr.cw makin'
ready to sail on Friday," says John.Po
kanig, the cook, "the poor thing commit
ted suicide. It was a black cat, too. .I'jn
only a cook â they say I'm not. a. sallor^at
allâ but I knowed things looked bad. They
were all talkin' of cur fine record run
down, but when last night they said we'd
make port to-day, the 13th, 1 said to me
pots, said I, 'I'm sorry, my lads, you're a
good lot, but before mornin' you're like
to be bangin' together on the galley deck
with fathoms of salt water above you.' "

the Cliff House. She lies scarce a | hun

Grimes has already been made acquaint
ed with the claims of Carpenters' Union
No. 483. and will hold a conference with
the officers of the Building Trades Coun
cil In the near future. Thus far Delegate
Grimes had shown a disposition to sup
port most strongly all the claims of Union
No. 4S3, and it is feared that the Building
Trades Council may reject his overtures.
At a meeting of the counciV last night
several of the officers declared that the
council would not recognize Carpenters'
Union No. 483 under any condition, and
Intimated that Grimes would be uncere
moniously turned down. Grimes is also
trying to settle the trouble between Car
penters' Union No. S<> of Alarneda and the
Alamcda Building Trades Council.
