IT is not always the proper thing i
inquire into the affairs of a man's
household, as every family and home
circle is a little world all to itself.
There are plenty of folks, however,
â¢who belong to the class of inquisitive
bores, whose chief business is to meddle
with other people's business, and there *s
scarcely a fireside whose peace and har
mony has not been- broken into by some
inQuisitive meddler. But not all inquirers
into the concerns of our homes are to
be classed as meddlers; there are those
who have a right to inquire- It was so
In the case of King Hezekiah when the
prophet Isaiah put the question to him:
"What have they seen in thine house?"
The King of Babylon, hearing of Hezo
kiah's sickness and recovery, sent letters
and a present to him. This so flattered
Hezekiah that he didn't hesitate to show
the Babylonians all that he had in his
house â his precious things and his armor.
There was nothing in all his dominion
that he failed to show them. The blunder
and folly of Hezekiah was his gratifying
his own glory and vanity, instead of ex
alting his God. He was informed by the
prophet of God that he should pay dear
for his folly in the loss of all these things
which appealed so much to his vanity.
Hezekiah isn't the only one who has
been most absorbed in the things of least
importance in his house. It is to be feared
that what the prophet said of the de
struction of Hezekiah' s house and its
contents may with equal force be said ot
many a home, where the labor and.
thought is all centered on the house and
its furnishings, instead of the furnishings
of the heart and mind of those who abide
there..
The question may well be asked to-day
concerning our home life and its influ
ence. "What have they seen in thine
house?" God who instituted the first
home when he gave Eve to Adam in
Eden, has unquestionably the right to
make this inquiry concerning our home
life.
We cannot 'well overestimate the im
portance of the home institution.
Its idea is instinctive in human na
tuie.
lien was not satisfied without hu
nun companionship, and so God gave
to nim a helpmeet and thus instituted thÂ«j

Tile first Government on earth was

The home, in the unitv and psr
petuitv of the family tie, in its purity

To "demoralize the familv" is to "de

way of moral and civil desolation."
The familv is then the first insti

that is good in society and permanent in

One summer afternoon during the Civil
War a Southern general sat under a tree
with some fellow officers. A shell from a
Northern battery suddenly crashed over
their heads. The officers hastened to
safer places. One lingered â the others,
looking back, saw him stooping to the
ground, as if he had found something of
great value. It was a broken bird's nest;
this was the secret The general was re
placing it with its sacred burden.

May we all realize that the surest way to
make an Ideal home here Is to make tha

The best way to accomplish the needful
national reforms is to make the homes of
our country the schools and nurseries of
every Christian grace and virtue.
To-day and always It will be true,
as in the days of the First Napoleon,
that what the country needs most Is
mothers. For with home and holy
motherhood; with home and noble
fatherhood; with . home - protected
childhood; with home and holy faith
enshrined in the hearts of the people
who have learned to love home, both
church and nation are secure. What
ever militates against the home
strikes a death blow at every interest
of humanity; whatever strengthens
and protects and purifies the home is
so much toward the advance of hu
manity.
The moral atmo3phcre of the home
should be wholesome. There should be no
temptation within its sacred precincts to
endanger the tender hearts that nestle
there. The mother love an*1 father love
should be pure and godly/ The social ills
that sin against the strength of youth
and warp us from the living truth should
be debarred from our homes. The world
has set its snares to catch the fÂ»et of un
wary youth; that is sad enough to con
template, but to think of Innocent feet
beta? ensnared In the meshes of aln
within their warm home neÂ«t Is appall
ing. And yet that la often done in ways
in which parents foolishly think to please
and help their children.
Let home be s at. least one rrtace of
safety for childhood and youth. Then we
should ever bear in mind that all well
grounded [ hopes of true social life and
Rational life spring from and have the!
roots In the culture of pure homes. Alt
that is strong and enduring in etther
grows out of this holy soil. Here either
lurks the disorder that corrupts society
and endangers the nation or abMe those
pure graces which Mess and enrich society
and guarantee national perpetuity.
The love, peace and confidence of the
home must be carefully nourished. Time
must 'be taken to sare for this flower gar
den or all its beauty and fragrance will
wither and vanish away. What mars tha
peace and destroys the beauty and sym
metry of the home is the lack of heart
nourishment Hoire shonM be n place
of safety here and a guide to heaven

When any one begins to lose taste for
his or her home and prefers to spend most
of their time elsewhere, they may well
suspect their lives, or else the home is not
what it should be. That employment la
dangerous to one's self and destructive to
the home which keeps one much away
from home, especially after the business
hours have Â«nded.
Payne has but written the language of
all normal human hearts. Explain it in
any way you please, there is no place like
home.
Home should be the place where wÂ«
most are and love most to be. This will
naturally follow if home is attractive.
Home implies "familiarity. "Home,
sweet home" is indeed a common senti
mentâand a chord to which all hearts can
beat in unison.
What makes it so? Because the sentl~.
mer.t lies nearest and v dearest to the
heart. We believe that the beautiful song,
"Home, Sweet Home," is the true tran
script of the author's heart at the time of
its writing. Â¦
The following version of the writing or
the song is said to have been related by
the author, John Howard Payne:
"It was In the garden of the Tuileries
that the words of "Home, Sweet Home"
first came to me. I had bee,n pretty much
all over the world, and in time I drifted
to Paris. But as I wandered alone and
without a penny through the city I be
came thoroughly homesick. I took a great
liking to the Tuilerie3. The sons of the
birds, the sunlight or moonlight through
ihe trees, the perfume of the flowersâ how
they all reminded me of home!
"Yes," continued Mr. Payne, "the Â«enti
ment had been running in my head a long
time. I could not hit on the rhyme. One
evening as I was resting in the Tuileries,
and the stars were venturing out from
'their hiding places, the strain of a beauti
ful melody was borne on the air. It was a
Sicilian . tune. I had heard it years be
fore. It was exactly what I had been
waiting for. With a heart full of home I
hurried back to my lodgings in a remote
part of Paris. Before the night was over
my work was done. The tune made the
poem. I had hardly a sou. in my pockets;
but one or two friends helped me. My
passage to America was paid. At last I
got back. There were sad changes. A
few. only were left. After all. there is
no place like home."
You observe I say normal heart. There
may be some people so abnormal in their
make-up that like "the man without a
country," whom Edward Everett Hale
writes about, they may not be drawn very
strongly by the home sentiment. But a
man who loves and reveres the pure home
sentiment is in nearness to the Sternal
Home. Â» . ' -â¢'

Fault-nnding is not compatible with
such love. This destroys the peace ana
harmony of the home, besides ruining
one's temper and putting him all out or
harmony with the music of the universe.
"Dear Moss," said the thatch on an
old ruin, "1 am so worn, so patched, so
ragged, really I am quite unsightly, i
wish you would come and cheer me up Â»
little. You will hide all my infirmities
and defects, and, through your loving
sympathy, no finger of contempt or ois
l:ke will be pointed at me."
"I come," said the Moss: and it crept
up and around, and in and out. till every
flaw was hidden, and all was smooth and
fair. Presently the sun, shone out ana
the old thatch looked bright and fair, a
picture of rare beauty in the' golden ray*.
"How beautiful the thatch looks, cried
[one who saw It. "How beautiful the
thatch looks." said another. "Oh. saiu
the old thatch, "rather let them say 'How
beautiful is the loving Moss. For it
upends itself in covering up my faults,
keeping the knowledge of them all to her
self, and by her own grace making my
age and poverty wear the garb of youth
and luxuriance."
May the mission of the moss to the old
thatch be our mission in each or our
homes. What a different world we would
have if this were true of us. May it be
Bald of our homes.' however elegant or
humble, "How beautiful that home
looks " because of the loving ones who
live there and who spend themselves in

of life."
Mrs. Sigourney is right when she says:
"The strength of a nation, especially of a
republican nationals in the intelligent and
well ordered homes of its people."
Then "suppose." as it has been said,
"that our home life could be put into some
permanent forms, and then our houses
should be buried by a catastrophe like
that of Pompeii, and at the end of eight
een centuries be brought to light. What
' would they disclose to 'the curious inves
tigators of that day? What does God see
there now?" What do others see?
I don't know what Is seen, but there are
some thines that ousrht to be seen in our
homes. TfrÂ«v should be thÂ« c^m 7 ~ >r >n

Holmes speaks of it in this way:
Home of our childhood! How affection clings.
And hovers around thee " with her seraph
â¢ ' wings!
Dearer tfiy hills, though clad in autumn brown.
Than fairest sutnmits which the cedars crow^
If home is as it should be, this would
be the sentiment of all. Home ought to
be attractive. To be so it must be happy. â¢
Parents and children should all combine
in making home the most tasteful and
'cheerful spot on earth.
The Earl of Orrery said: "Whenever
v.e step out of domestic life in search of
felicity we/come back again disappointed,
tired and chagrined. One day passed un
der our own roof with our friends and
cur family is worth a thousand in another
place."
Home being one of the chief agencies
in bringing about the consummation of
the perfect manhood of which Christ w.is
a type, it must be such a place the Earl
just describedâ happy, pleasant, attrac
tive.
Don't misunderstand me. I don't mean
to have ycu think that the building, with
all its elegant furniture and fixtures,
makes the homeâ not so.
Home Is not merely four square walls.
Though with pictures hunK and gilded.

Home is where there's one to love!
Home Is where there's one to love us!
Home's not merely house and room.
It needs something to endear It:
Home is where the heart can bloom.
Where there's some kind lip to cheer It!.

A SEARCH IN THE DARK,
"Coming up from Salt Creek they are
almost. sure to strike for the Loving
brothers' outfit at the. head of the west
fork of the Trinity," Stiilwell said to the
At the head of a troop of the Fourth
Cavalry and guided by Jack Stiilwell, the
scout. Colonel McKonzie had come Into
Texas from Fort Sill in search of a. raid
ing party of Kiowas. For days his men
had been patrolling the territory just
south of Red. River for sign of them. One
section of the colonel's force having
touched Henrietta, he had learned there
of the raids taking place farther to the
south. Aware that no man on the fron
tier was better acquainted with the coun
try and with the situation of the various
ranches than Stiilwell, he called the
ecout into consultation.
There were many bodies of troops op
erating in and around the Indian Terri
tory in that day, some of them com
manded by men who 6ince then have be
come famous as fighters. Colonel Miles
(now lieutenant general) was at Fort
Supply, in the west: Colonel Custer in
the north, and Colonel McKenzie in the
eouth. and they were all kept busy chas
ing raiders back upon their reservations
and punishing them for depredations. Of
the three, the gallant McKenzie probably
was the most feared by the Kiowas and
the Comanches. "The Man Who Kills"
was one of Uheir many names for him
although more generally he was known
as Mangomhents (or "The Man Without

there helpless, with' the strong, valiant
self-reliant, reckless fellow who invaded
her lonely camp on that fateful night.

has been reduced to this,", she would say
Still the sick man grew no better; still
was he hovering between life and death.
Sometimes, she thought, he knf/v . her;
but these were rare moments. More
often he gave her the impression that he
was waking into a, new existence in which
he would have no remembrance of the
things that had gone before. And at all
times he was as helpless as a child and
needed her constant, care.
But there were some things of value in
the wagon, and little by little the effects
it contained were sold to provide neces
saries for the sick man. At the end of a
month the wagon itself had to go.
"Now, indeed, I am doomed.", she had
told herself when parting with it.
One thing which sorely troubled her
was that she was without funds, penni
less, and the .proprietor of the hotel, a
cross-grained, cross-eyed man whom the
gamblers called Muggins "for luck." was
hard-fisted and insistent. Â¦
To this place, bad as It was, the
wounded cowboy was taken; and here
also, simply because there was no other
place. Missus. Jim took up her abode as
his nurse. The thought -of a tragedy
that would perhaps occur were the gam
bler to find her here in attendance upon
a sick man had come into her mind not
once, but many times; yet as often she
had resolutely put it away in the convic
tion that she was performing a duty.
This man had befriended her boy. lie
had risked his life for her; she surely
would do as much for him.
In that day Henrietta was a collection
of log huts and cheap frame dwellings.
The only two-story building in the town
was known as "The Hotel." The ground
floor front "of this hotel was fitted up as
a bar and gambling saloon, with faro and
roulette and poker and monte tables. In
the rear, separated . from the saloon by
a thin board partition, was the hotel din
ing-room. Upstairs were the sleeping
apartments. The patrons of . the place
were stockmen, gamblers and buffalo
hunters, with an occasional woman of a
certain class, who would stop only long
enough to get her bearings before branch
ing out with a resort of her own. j

CHAPTER XVII.
Twice during that month Brockman had
opened his heart to Missus Jim. She
couldn't go on living as she was, he told
her. He knew of a chap who wasn't good
enough to saddle her horse, but who
"thought a heap" of her and who would
take good care of her and of the maverick
If only she would say the word; a man
who had loved her ever sinceâ well, ever
since she had fainted in his arms and had
been held tight to his breast that night
when life seemed pretty near the end for
both of them. There, the thing was out.
and he had wondered how he was soin<
to say it.
And at the first telling he had thought
from, the look upon ner face and the
quaver in her voice that his happiness
was certain. No woman could desire a .
better man for her husband, she had said 3
to him. It would make her happier than
he knew to be able to give him the an
swer he wished. Butâ she could not
There was a reason. No. she could not
tell him what it wasâ only that it was
something not even time would remove.
No. it was not that she did not . He
must not ask her that; was it not enough
to say that she was not sorry he thought
well enough of her to ask her to be his
wife and that It did grieve her that there
existed a reason why she could never
marry? .
At the second tellln|r all the impetuslty
that was latent in him flared up in re
volt and he declared that he just would
marry her. reason or nor reason. He had
his own consent and the maverick's., and
if she didn t know what was good for her
they did and he would have his way In
spite of all the reasons' that could be piled
on' top 6f each other.
And then she had smiled at him through
her tears and told him the thing he pro
posed was impossible. Â¦ '
The reason, then? He must know the
reason, so as to be able to Judge for hlm
%?}Â£' Â» lÂ£ any one cl9e know of. it? Yes!
Who? Rose Goodwin!
Then, jso strangely does fate order
things. Parson Potter returned to Hen
rietta and Rose followed in his wake.
Stranger still, there was a wonderful
change in the woman. She attended every
meeting at which the-, parson preached
and it was her voice that started tha
nymns when he gave them out.- But all
that aside.
Miasus Jim had not supposed that How
- "This business of mavericklng humans
is getting to be a disease with you. Ed,"
he had said on going away. "Ye can try
It just onqe more, and then ye stopâ or
I sure will pull on ye."
There had been some planning done by
Brockman and Benola. It had been de
cided that their joint capital would be
sufficient to embark them in ranching la
a small way, and a partnership had been
declared. The ranch was to be in L03
Valley, and Benois already had parted
with the Half-Diamond L crowd and gona
down there to take up homestead claims.
He had claims filed for four persons,
these were proved up satisfactorily later
on. Brockman's intentions with respect
to Missus Jim were perfectly well known
to old Pole.
For another month Brockman remained
in Henrietta, and at the end of that time
he very nearly was his old self in the
matter of physical strength. The mav
erick had remained with him, and be
cause of the suddenly developed willful
ness of the boy in opposing a return to
their former home Missus Jim also had
been compelled to remain. She had taken
possession of a log cabin on the outskirts
of town and arranged with Parson Potter
that Captain Davis should undertake to
settle up her affairs in Kentucky and
convert her small holdings there Into
money. Rose had seen fit to follow Pax
son Potter to Jacksboro.

"Mister Benois," said the Â¦ little \ fellow
earnestly, "did Mister " ' Brockman go to

"Reckon you'll have to ask Brockman
about that," was Pole's reply. ,
.On the way up every, one in' the hunt
noticed that the maverick was preoccu

Even an immense herd I of antelope, per

"Why did he go away?",- . - >.

"Same as to me," was Ringer's reply.

They listened. Allen was right. Sume
one was feeling his way ajong the parti

across the pine boards.
"Shoot at the sound." Ringer suggested.
Allen was about to act on the advice
when a faint voice called out:
"Hello, you people!"
"Brockman!" cried. Benois, a lump ris
ing In his throat as he shoved Allen s re
volver aside. "Where's the door?

The besieged cowboys sent up a mighty
cheer, in which even Brockman joined,
though ever so. faintly. It was a spon
taneous tribute to the maverick.
There were other yells back there along
the road. They could distinguish them
easily nowâ the "Yip-yip-yip!" of the Her
ald men and the screaming laugh of the
Ikardltes, their "Ah-haâ ha-ha-haâ ah!"
The maverick wasn't doing things by
halves. He had brought the entire camp,
to the rescue. ,
The mobbers heard them, also, and they
fell out by twos and threes and hunted
cover until not more than twenty re
mained. These, headed by the Goodwin
ites, made a last desperate effort to rush
the besieged cowboys: but before they
could carry the place the men from camp
were upon them, shouting like fiends and
shooting into them from all sides.
Panic-stricken, the mothers fled In every
direction. Then followed a "shootlng-up
of the town" that has become historic on
the northern frontier of Texas. From end
to end of the settlement the invaders
spurred their horses, sfcooting into win
dows and ' doorways ' and volleying at
shadows - and yelling like demons until
every light was extinguished, every in
habitant burrowed out of sight; until the
very dogs were stricken dumb with fright
and crouched shivering with their tails be
tween their legs. Then and only then,
was the wrath of the cowboys appeased
Their natural enemies, the gamblers, had
, received a 'drubbing the memory of which
could, never, be" effaced.
Meanwhile the maverick had galloped
the gray up to the door of Muggins' bar
and called'out in a voice full of anxiety:
-Â» "Are we in time? Is everybody all
right?" 'Â¦Â¦
Almost before the words were out of his
mouth the door was thrown open and he
was lifted off his horse by the men whose
relief he had secured and who patted and
slapped him approvingly as they carried
him in where Brockman lay upon the
floor. ,' -,-Â¦'
."".It wasn't much of a meeting, so far as
speech is concerned, but there was a
world of feeling and of 'sympathy in the
touch of their hands. The maverick knelt
beside the wounded cowboy.
"Did be do it?" he asked in an awe
stricken whisper.
Brockman understood him. "No; It was
a Kiowa," he answered. Tnen he added:
"And your little mammy was along when
It happened; She's here now. You'll see
her presently. She'll tell you. I s'pose
you'll both be, off to Kentucky, now that

Benois .limped to the door. A big mob
was. gathering down- the .street. Men
were running about "with guns and pis

had been ; manipulating the roulette wheel
was Â¦ there , haranguing them and I pointing-
In the direction of Muggins 1 bar. . â¢
. "Then we'll ..wait till he can," 'Langford
said. V "He's going with us. If we have to

There was a. shout and ,'a cheer from
down the street. Muggins looked in that
direction, then â¢ turned . and fled. : ."Here
theycome!" he yelled as he disappeared
around a corner of the house.'. "I told ye
to dust,, durn ye!"..- A, '.?.'â¢ Â¦-,''-'*;
"Why," that man can't travel none!"
Muggins shouted ' back. "He's too near
dead." . v Â¦ :. '. . , Â¦Â¦ : Â¦ \
. Then Muggins arose from behind the
bar.\where he" had . dropped at the first
sipn of hostilities:- "Light out, for God's
sake!" he pleaded. "They'll come back
ah' t tear down the shack !". He seized the
dying man by the shoulders .and half
dragged, half carried him out to the road
way. ."Hoof it, I tell ye!" he called out
to - the cowboys. "Them gamblers'll get
together/ an' clean ye out!" â¢ : .'
. "Bring "the ,; wagon- and -,the horses
'round here In front," 'Allen -said to him
"We've got a little I. business tho
man upstairs, and we'll just take him
along." ' ' ' â¢Â¦"-;â¢ . Â¦ â¢
There was a rush for the door. The
maverick climbed, up ori the bar.' He saw
the gambler writhing on the floor and
Benois standing over him. "He jumped
down, was caught in the rush, and carried
into the street. Â¦ In ten seconds the place
was clear., .
With drawn revolvers Allen, Langfor*
and Ringer lined up beside Benois.". "Out
you go, all of you!' cried Langford.' "The
first man that tries to pull down!"
â¢ Two revolvers spoke at the same In
stant. The gambler's. shot, aimed at the
head, slit Pole's right ear. Benois had fired
through his holster and the bullet entered
the gambler's vitals. Goodwin spun half
around, the weapon fell from his hand and
he sank, slowly -to the floor.' " â¢ ,
Benois wheeled about to face the bar.
Muggins - was I nowhere In sight. At the
fame instant a warning cry from Lang
ford told him that, he had been tricked.
He turned. Goodwin had him covered.
Benois was watching .him like a hawk.
He saw. Goodwin lift his head and a
smile grow "upon his face, fie scented
treachery. .
"That's right, Muggins." the gambler
suddenly called out. "Tane the boy up
stairs for me." " Â¦
Goodwin flashed a glance about the bar.
"So you've got -the drop on me, have
you?" he muttered. "Well, all right. I
cave."
"Ye've done all the. harm ye'H ever do
that boy or his mother," he said quietly.,
Benois jumped at Goodwin, wrested the
boy from his grasp and passed him to
Ringer, who dropped him behind the, bar.
Benois slid his hand to the grip of his
six-shooter. He made no effort lo draw
the weapon, but pressed down on the grip
until the holster was uptilted so that the
muzzle of the revolver was on a line with
Goodwin's waist.
"So!" he cried, ' "I've found- you, have
I, you pup? .Now, by the Lord, I'll know
where that mother of yours is hidden or
I'll break every bone in your body."
The maverick was bending over-,the lay
out, examining it curlouslv . when a new
comer entered the bar. The man! was
Goodwin. He^ took in the cowboys at a
glance .and then ." his eyes fell "upon, the
maverick. With an oath he sprang at the
boy, seized him by the neck, held him out
at arm's length and shook him fiercely.
"Here you are, Mister Durham." The
gambler vgave the wheel a turn. "The
eagle bird pays you a hundred for one;
the red only give you even money." .
t "Stolen, did ye say?" Muggins gasped.
This was serious. Men had been swung
up to trees for having stolen horses in
their possession. â¢' "Why. that horse be
longs to the man upstairsâ the chap with
a bullet in his lung.-' he hastened to ex
plain.
Then "the man upstairs"., must be
Brockman! Benois lilted his glass. "To
our absent friend." he said.
-VTo our absent friend/' the others re
peated and drank.'
"About that horse?" Muggirfs ventured.
' "We'll settle that," Langiord said, "with
the man upstairs." : " >
The maverick's eyes were dancing.
"Maybe tne man upstairs is-^- 1 " '
Benois warned him with-a quick glance.
"Go'over to the wheel : "and put 5 . that on
the" red," he said, tossing the boy a coin.
"Ed's big gray is out there in the pen."
In a flash Benois turned upon Muggins.
"Ye've got a horse out in your pen -iiat
was stolen from our outfit. Branded with
a half-diamond L on the left shoulder.
What do you know about it?" he de
manded. - ' :Â¦
This .time the laugh was on the gamb
lers, and Muggins joined fn it so heartily
that Langford suspected his mirth wa.<
forced. ' Allen came in. from the corral,
and as he filled his glass he whispered to
Pole: . â¢ .
"Don't mind owning up that ye got tho
breed straight," he saiu. "He's blooded
stock, all right, and clean bred. Most of
the cattle hereabouia must a-ueen crossed
with coyote, for 'they're hell on howi
ing." â¢ : â¢ ..
"Better, order some mother's milk for
the . young Durham," the gambler said
sneeringly, jerking his thumb toward the
maverick. The remark seemed to tickle
the fancy of the loungers, for they roure.l
with laughter. "Ringer was about to
make a hot reply, when Benois headed
him off. ' .
"Nope," Pole replied, taking his meas
'ure; "drinking with some picked cattle,
two here -and one a-comlng."-
"Prinking alone?". one or tne Goodwin
party asked, leaving- a roulette wheel he
had been twirling and sauntering up to
the bar. ' .'. '.
The boy evidently had np news to offer.
Benois turned to Allen. "See where he
takes the horses, so's we'll know where
to find 'em if we need *em in a hurry."
Then he limped into the bar, closely fol
lowed by the maverick and the others.
"Give us something to cut the dust out of
our throats," he said to Muggins.
"Tamblen, senor."
At the beginning of the one street that
split the town from, east to west Benois
lashed his team into a lope and drove fur
iously into the settlement, his escort gal
loping alongside. " In front of the hotel
he pulled up with a !. loud "Whoa-ho
there!" that -brought all the loungers to
the street. - ' ,
'. "Como le ve, muchacho?" he called out
to Manuel, throwing him the lines.
"Bien, senor," Â¦ replied the boy. , ,
"E los otros?" . . .
"No. Just keep your eyes on the mav
erick and your ears open for brag, and
we'll see and hear enough." Â¦
"I'll post the others," Langford said.
"Here, . youngster, give me back that ca
yuse."
"Better not let on about Ed until the
game's on, then," suggested Lansford.
" 'Twcn't do to pass the drop up to
them." .
"Man's a gambler." Benois said to him.
"Don't know no better way than to get
right In among the blacklegs \ and then
watch the youngster. The man he shies
at'll be my meat. You' ns can keep the
flies off."
On the way in Langford traded his
mount with the maverick for a seat in
the> wagon. - V '
saw him hit"ching up. a fresh team.
' â¢.Sure,". said Pole. '"Didn't tell you be
fore, but Ed he came up to town on a
shooting matter, and I. reckon he's hit
trouble. Promised him I'd take up the
game 'where he left off. That's my busi
ness in town." . r .
"Then I'm' with you," Langford said.
"We'll take Ringer and Alien, and I'll
drop a hint to Kirby that if we ain't
back by night we need looking after." - '
\, Good!" grunted Benois, as he buckled
a collar and swung the hames into place.
"Maverick's in it; too. It's his. game,
but ho doesn't know the play." Man that
ran away with his mammy's the cuss we
want." Â¦ .' Â¦-; -.Â¦..,
As he toppled from the saddle he was
conscious that she clung to him to the
last, and was falling with him. Then
everything slipped away from him.
Henrietta.? Yes; but Bhe must go on.
alone. He would drop In a minute, and
then the pray, with only her weight up,
would fairly fly away from these Indians.
He had done the best he could, but every
thing was getting away from him.
"Missus Jim,' he gasped, "I'm hit bad;
Tm a-losing ye. Turn intoâ the saddle if
âye can. Keep the trailâ stay with the
rrayâ andâ rideâ ride like hell! Quick
hold to thÂ« saddle."
He was swaying from side to side now;
anotheriump or two and he woulo be
cone. Why didn't she let eo? She couldn't
hold him when he couldn't hold himself.
"Let go of me!" he gasped. "Let go!"
Ah. this was it! He was going now,
railingâ down, down, down. And there
was a sheet of lightning flashing out
there in front of them, and a sudden loud
roar, as of thunder; and he was sroins
down, down, down.
Hah! Bhe was like the maverickâ she
could fight when she had to. And how
Quiet she was about it. No trembling
now. Times surely had changed. He was
thÂ© weak one â it . was his turn to faint
now. Would she hold him as close, he
wondered. Ah, how things were whirling
round with him! Pretty soon he would go
down with a rush. And she knew it, for
she had caught the horn of the saddle
with one hand and was steadying him
with the other. Yes. he was going down
with a rush in a mlcute â but how cool
and coft her hand felt on his neck!
"Agalnl" he shouted. "Give it to 'em
again! Let them have the hot Irons now.
Aha-ie-rah ow-wah!"
With each shot Bhe fired Brockman sent
back a fierce yell.
She drew the revolver from the holster
and fired at the black shadows in the
distance. '
"NoT* he shouted, fiercely. "I'll hold
ye here. Ye might fall oft. If ye can
ehoot, get my gun out and give it to 'em."
"You are hurt!" she cried. "Let me
elt up. I can ride. It will be easier for
you.
She would think he was drunk. He
ehouldn't have yelled into her ears that
way. Good God, how dizzy he was! Yes,
they were ehooting again, but she mustn't
think of that, or these hot irons might
get into her brain.
They were yelling back there, but what
of that! He could yell, too. Let them
have It; he'd give them a throat-splitter
to practice on: "Aha-1-e-yah ow-wah!"
"Aha-i-e-yah ow-wah!" "Aha-i-e-yah
ow-wah!"
The woman in his arms came to with a
rasp, and stared up into his face.
Henriettaâ that was the place: and he
must get there for the maverick's sake â
yes, and for the sake of the somebody
that he held against his breast. That
was it; that was worth the effort. The
Wg gray knew It, and was telling him so;
he was clicking it out with his hoofs at
every stride: "Here's your mammy!"
"Here's your mammy!" "Here's your
mammy!"
He mustn't think about this! It was
to Henrietta, they were going, and there
were howling devils following close be
hind. That was itâ Henrietta! But these
red-hot Irons? Never mind them; they
fcad come a long way already, and the
gray was good and strong yet. But It
suddenly had grown awfully hot, and,
rtrange thing, that moon was just drying
up his brain; he didn't dare look at it
again, for it burned his eyes. Something
had set matters going all wrong, for even
the grass under their feet, which ought
to be waving yellow, was here, there, all
cbout, only redâ red â red.
But at every Jump now Brockman
quivered with pain. It seemed, each
time the gray's feet struck the earth, as
If some one were plunging a redhot iron
Into that wound into his shoulder. He
could feel the warm blood gushing from
1t and trickling down his back: the arm
grew numb; he only realized it when he
taw his precious burden slipping away
Jrom. him. With a great effort he wound
his right arm about her and twisted his
hand into the opening in his shirt. The
gray must guide himself now, for that
left arm dropped helpless at his side.
The hot irons began to reach upâ they
Â¦were plunging Into his neck at the back,
end tnen into his temples. How' they
tortured .him! Oh. for a moment's rest!
Oh, if he could only stop the gray for an
instant, so that those irons would stop
end so that he could breathe, for he was
suffocating. Something had gotten into
his throat: the breath wouldn't come, and
when he tried to force it the hot. irons
went jabbing into his side, searing and
tearing his breast.
A low moan caused Brockman to look
down Into the face of his companion.
With the moonlight falling upon it. it
was like a face cut in marDle,' more like
the face of a child than that of a woman
and a mother. The features were fine
and regular and email; not beautiful, but
sweet and gentle; and there was a fire
In the brown hair which made it seem
like a crown of bronze. It was so like
the maverick's face Brockman wondered
that he had not recognised her even by
the flickering light of the campfire.
What a little creature she was, to be
sure: hardly larger than the boy. he
thought. And what a world of trouble
had been unloaded upon, that frail body.
There must be something fearfully out of
gear with human affairs when a great
hulking fellow like himself went scot-free
of care and a helpless woman like this
was crushed to earth and overwhelmed
with woe. And she had been deserted in
that desolate spotâ he would not believe
otherwise â by her cur of a husband. It
Â¦was luckv for him that he was not now
â¢within gunshot. Even with this pack of
bloodhounds in full cry behind them, he
would call him to account, and the surest
eye and the quickest finger with ! the
trigger would decide between them. And
then ,
And then a stinging blow upon the left
shoulder, which almost threw him from
the saddle and caused him to grunt with
the pain of it, brought him back in a flash
to their present danger. He had been
hit. The Indians had begun firing at
lonp range, and a chance shot had struck
home. It was a chance shot, /he felt sure,
for he had been among t"hem In the
Nation and he knew that they were poor
marksmen. Still, It hurt, just the same,
and another chance shot might disable
the Btallion, and thenâ well, then their
scalps would continue the journey north
while their bodies would be left there on
the prairie for the gray wolves and the
coyotes. It was time to run in earnest,
and the stallion stretched into giant
etrides as he felt the steel boring into his
sides.
*-yt LONE, Brockman would have
f\ waited to take one* shot at them
/ I and then have given the gray his
V. I head and left them as if they were
Jl standing still. But now he would
take no risk that was not forced upon
him: they must not, come too close. He
touched the gray gently with the spur,
and the big fellow tossed his mane, half
turned his head, and gave a shrill neigh,
which sounded like a challenge as he
forged ahead.

CHAPTER XIVâ Continued.
There were many new graves in the
cemetery on the Little Wichita when all
was over, "and each grave a sermon in
itself," the parson had said as he stood
there bareheaded before a motley crowd
of sinners and preached against the
futility of serving "in that army that Is
led by the devil."
"Amen to that"' the parson said; and
soon afterward he drew a blanket up
over the set face, and touching Rose upon
the shoulder went from tne house tu
work that was awaiting him in the road
way before Muggins' Hotel.
Throughout the night the parson la
bired with and prayed over and ; off erod
what comfort and consolation he could to
the dying gambler. In the beginning h-s
was reviled, cursed, Jeered at. But his
Infinite patience and pity and unselfish
earnestness wrought a change, and at the
last there was a wailing cry of "God for
give me!" that brought Rose to her
knees in tears at the bedside.
"And you?" he moaned, staring into
her face. "And you. Rose?"
"I â oh, Jim! 1 forgive you, too!" she
sobbed. "May God forgive us both!"
It was, perhaps, just as well that Missus
Jim had been called away, although there
were two reasons why Parson Potter
would have had her there: that she might
have witnessed the deathbed repentance
of the man who had deceived her. ana
have added her forgiveness to that of thfÂ»
other woman whose life he had wrecked.
There was another reason, also, but that
was not so urgent. It related to a deli
cate commission undertaken at the re
quest of Captain Davis to ascertain if
she could be induced to leave Goodwin
and would permit the captain to arrange
for her return to her old home.
He lifted the unconscious man in his
arms, and. guided by Rose, strode off
into the night.
Potter was a name to conjure with any
where on that frontier. Every cowboy
knew it as that of the Fighting Parson:
a man who would sing hymns from the
back of a bucking broncho, who could
handle the rope lute one of themselves,
who had preached salvation to a crowd
of turbulent sinners held in order by the
frowning muzzle of his revolver, and with
whose tours of his circuit neither Indian
raid nor stress of weather was ever per
mitted to Â¦ interfere. They saluted him
respectfully and drew off.
"There is a flicker of life in this sinner
yet," the parson said, stooping over the
body. "Let us take him in."

note in his voice when he spjke.
".You sure tock a big ris'K fur me." he
said. "And so you wouldn't .-ell the
Pray? Well, if ever you go back to
Kentucky, you can just take him along
with you. He ain't broke to a side
saddle: not yet, he ain't: but if you
am t in too much of a hurry to get away,
me and the maverick can coax him to
"He it all right. , Ifâ if ever you do go
away." he repeated.
We are not going away. Are we,
"T n ? y>? the maverick asked.
l do not knowâ there is nothing eh.e
I ,* U *L to , d0 - l fear that we must." she
said, hesitatingly. ( 'Ar.d yet. there Js so

Cou"dn't C y U ou?" maVenCk l Â°Â°
"I've been thinking some of that s,ame."
Brcckman said very softly.
The raid was over and the bar down
stairs was crowded with the cowboys,
who were celebrating their victory. The
town still was housed up, except lor two
persons, a man and a woman, who were
searching out the wounded. The woman
was Rose. The man might have been
either a. cowboy or a gamblor to judge by
his attire- He carried a big six-shooter
slung at his hip, wore his trousers tucked
into his boots, and the band of his som
brero was a leather strap fastened with
a buckle. Their search had led them in
front of the hotel, when an exclamation
from the woman drew the man to her
side and at the same time attracted the
attention of those in the bar.
The man was kneeling beside a body
the woman had pointed out to him. when
there was a rush from the bar and
twenty voices ordered him at once to
declare whether he was for or against
the gamblers. He looked up into the
scowling faces without flinching, then
arose and replied In a strong voice:
"I am against the devil in any shape,
and this is devil's work." He pointed to
the man at his feet as he spoke. "And
if the devil interferes with me." patting
the gun at his hip, "I shall fight him
witli his own weapons."
"Men!" It was Rose who spoke, and
the tremor in her voice might have been
due to the fact that six-shooters were
being brandished again by the cowboys.
"Men, this is the parsonâ Parson Potter.
Let him do his work."
"Go with' her. Missus ', Jim!"- he
gasped. The words were so faint as ; to
be hardly audible.
'â¢'Good !",. cried jipse. > "And you won't
be lef t ; alone f either, for Muggins shall
bring a woman to take care of you." .
."Anything to oblige Rose," Muggins
said, and got his eyes in a fearful' tangle
as he leered at' her. "
There was' a sudden commotion in tho
bar belowâ a shout, a scuffling of feet, a
stampede to the street and, a jangle of
oaths and queries out in. front.- Muggins
ran half way down the stairs, peered out,
then hurried back as fast as '.'his Mega
couid carry him. ".,
"It's the wagon," he said to the wom
en. "Manuel drove it out to the road an'
thi^, new Goodwin has set up a claim to
it. ; He s a-hollerln' for rrte now to tell
him where I got it.: Ye'd better lite out
onctâ down the back way an' 'round
by the corral." ;Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢â¢ %$**$%*
"Here, landlord! Where's that cross
eyed thief? Landlord!" some one below
was shouting. ; ' â¢ . > , ..
"Comin':". yelled Muggins, hurrying
both women into the hall. ("Off with ye,
quick, while they're all out in;' . front !)
Comin', durn ye! Here I be." In his eag
erness to prevent them from coming up
he tripped and fell from top to bottom of
the stairs. - i ;
With .the breath jolted out of him,
Muggins was unceremoniously jerked to
his feet by the Goodwin crowd and plant
ed face to facelwith its leader.
"How aid you come by that outfit?" the
gambler demanded to know, pointing to
the wagon, which had been drawn up in
front ot the hotel. ..."
"Oh, that? ". How did I come by that?"
Muggins repeated, rubbing his head and
striving for time to- think. "Whyâer
some o' the boys found it _own south by
the branch, after the Kiowas went up a
couple o' moons back."
"The womanâ what became -of her?"
asked.
"There weren't no woman. Leastwise
we hadn't lost no woman, an' so we
didn't look for none." Â¦-.-.Â¦
"You're a-lying. Muggins," .said' the
gambler. â¢ "That Mexican says you
bought this wagon from a woman, and
that the woman calls herself Missus
Goodwin. You're holding out on me. Deal
square or there'll be trouble. Where is
this Missus Goodwin?"
"Here she is!" said a voice oh the edge
of .the crowd. . : - . Â¦ '.'-..
"Rose!" muttered Muggins.
She pushed through the mob. and placed
herselt directly in front -of the gambler,
her arms akimbo, her head thrown back,
her whole attitude breathing defiance.
The gambler started : back in surprise
and swore a great oath. -â¢â¢
"Here she is," Rose said again. "Missus
Goodwini if you please, and the only orig
inaL "Missus Goodwin in this town, if
any of you doubt it, just ask him." and
she pointed to the gambler. , "Muggins
lied to you, did he? Don't suppose that
you ever told a lie in your life, did you?
Well, the boy was right. Missus Good
win did sell that- outfit; ;and I'd like to
have some of you tell me: who i has a bet

V; The gambler jmade a -movement indica
tive of intense" disgust- and 1 ' sought: to push
his way outithrough theVrowd.
Â¦ '."Just one â¢ minute, : if you please." Rose
said, "with mocking politeness. "Let us
i have this matter thoroughly cleared up.
I appeal to "-Â¦ you, - men." Does' this rig
belong' to Muggins, : who it and
paid for it with hard- dollars, or does it
belong to this man who only, claims it?"'
"Muggins!" shouted; the crowd, -enjoy
ing to the full the spectacle Rose was
providing. The Goodwlnites hastily aban
doned the field and took refuge in the bar.
â¢ "Thank" you, my bullies!" , cried the'
triumphant Rose. 'Â¦"-,"' â¢
figure this thing out," Rose said to
Missus Jim. , "No one can hurt'' you
there, and no one would think' of looking
for you there. .You needn't fear-con
tamination,", rather fiercely, as . Missus
Jim seemed to shrink from the offer;
"you'll have the place all to yourself.".
"It isn't that," Missus Jim said quickly.
"Don't think I meant that. But how/can
I leave this. sick man? He. has nofone
else to depend on." . - /
Rose strode past her and stood beside
the bed. -V . < . .Â¦;Â¦-" i 'Â¦
"Can you understand what I say?" she
asked of . Brockman. . . '
;.l be,. wounded -man nodded faintly.
-Then listen. - This woman is in
danger. You are too weak to protect
her. -I Would you rather have her . come
with me, with one- of my sort, or remain
here r and -be murdered*â perhaps before
your eyes?" -.- . . . /
Missus Jim bent over him to catch his
answer. The thin hand was again ex
tended. : ; Â¦ ..-.â¢-.
And sitting in the bed of her own wag
on with Brockman's head In her lap,
Missus Jim rode into Henrietta." Nor was
she troubled with questions as to her re
lations with the wounded, man. for fron
tiersmen are chivalrous and their cour
tesy and kindliness are not of the inquisi
tive sort.
The surgeon's â¢ Intention had been to
carry Brockman in on a stretcher made
of blankets and swung between slow mov
ing pack horses, but Missus Jim urged
him to send some of the escort back to
her own camp to bring up the wagon for
that purpose, the lieutenant's phrase, "if
we can get him to camp without shaking
the life out of him," having convinced
her that the utmost care was necessary.
It was the first the surgeon had heard of
a wagon so near at hand. He was glad
to comply In order to secure it for an
ambulance.
It was not until daylight that the start
could be made and the wounded man
moved, so the escort of ten men was sent
into camp on the spot, while McKenzie
started nqrth at once with his trouble
some prisoners. A tent was set up over
Brockman and some blankets were spread
for him. The surgeon sought to persuade
Missus Jim to take some rest, but she re
fused to leave Brockman's side.
"There's a fighting chance," the lieu
tenant told her. "If we can get him to
camp without shaking the life out of him,
he may get well. Bullet is in his lung,
and the surgeon dare not risk probing for
It here. His \ head- is hurt, too. Must
have had a nasty fall. The colonel has
ordered an escort of ten men to take you'
both to Henrietta. The surgeon will go
along."
She looked up in affright; then arose
and clasped her arms about'the stallion's
neck. This was sympathy indeed; this
was his horse, the gallant,, animal that
had refused to desert them even in dis
aster.
There was a tramping about in .the
grass beside her, but she paid no heed.
There was a hot breath upon her neck,
but she stirred not. Then the long, slen
der nozzle of the big gray was thrust
into the grass at her face and rubbed
against the brown hair.
As he turned away, she dropped in the
tall grass and buried her face in her
hands. Perhaps he was already deadâ
this man who had befriended her "child
and who had saved her life. She had
known him scarcely more than an hour,
yet It seemed that she was losing the
friend of a lifetime. His looks, his con
duct, the rough chivalry and the unself
ishness of the cowboyâ all these fitted
Into the picture of an ideal man that she
had drawn long ago in her Â» girlhood.
And so it seemed to her as if she had
known him as long as she had known this
Ideal. - . ; > .
The surgeon came, made a quick exam
ination of the wound, and shook his head.
The lieutenant led Missus Jim to one
side.
"Wait here a bit," he said. "We'll do
the best. we can for him."
She turned at. the sound of his voice,
and, as she saw his uniform, held out her
hands appealingly. "Oh, sir, . he is dy
ing!" she cried. "Help me to save him!"
"Are you hurt?" the lieutenant asked.
In an Instant he was beside the group.
To his surprise, the horse, instead of
making off, followed and stood near him
as he bent over Missus Jim, wno had
Brockman's head in her lap.
"Good God, that's a woman!" he
shouted to Stiilwell. "Never mind the
horse â bring the surgeon up at once."
Picket ropes were spliced hurriedly to
make a long line, and strung along this
like fence posts a dozen troopers started
out to encircle the gray in a rope corral.
The lieutenant at one end of the line,
had just passed beyond the stallion when
he caught a glimpse of two figures â one
kneeling, the other prostrate, i r
"Then hunt him up," said the com
mander. "And take the surgeon with
you; he may be alive."
1 "You can have him for nothing, for
I' reckon the owner's dead," Stiliweil
replied. "The man who rode that horse is
the one they were after. I saw him go
down Just as we opened fire."
"That's a white man's outfit, sure."
said Stiilwell. "These bucks all ride
'pack trees.' That's a stockman's rig."
"If the horse is as good as he looks,
I'll give a hundred for him," the com
mander said.-
The horses of the defeated Kiowas were
rounded up. Off on the northern edge of
the battle-ground an animal stood alone,
his head high in the air.
"There's one you missed, and one that
you'll have trouble in catching," the Com
manding officer said to a young lieu
tenant at his side. Â¦ . . '
The encounter was short, sharp, deci
sive and altogether one-sided. A few of
the Kiowas got away, Satanta among
them, but a number were slain and the
remainder made prisoners. It was a hard
blow to the Indians, and marked the be
ginning of the end of their devilment on
the northern frontier of Texas. Satanta
himself escaped only for a time. He was
caught at Fort Sill on his return, taken
to Jacksboro for trial, and sentenced to
be hanged in the post there, Fort Rich
ardson. The sentence was commuted to
life imprisonment, however, and he died
a suicide in the State prison at Hunts
ville. But that was long afterward.
And so it happened that out of that
flash that was like lightning and on the
heels of that roar that was like thunder
there came charging a troop of horse. It
swept toward the surprised Indians, and
another sneet of flame spouted from
along the line. Then carbines were thrust
into holsters, and with six-shooters in
hand McKenzie's men closed . in upon
them.
Colonel McKenzie's preparations were
made In an instant. Without bugle call
and by spoken command the men sprang
into their saddles, unsluhg their carbines
and waited for the word.
And at the scout's suggestion the com
mand had moved south from Henrietta
that evening, traveling at a sharp trot.
Twenty miles from the town the com
mand was halted to rest the - horses.
While the. men were down Stiilwell rode
on in search of water. . He had not gone
a mile when he heard yells and rille
shots, and he galloped back to the camp
to tell the colonel that the Kiowas were
running right into them either in pursuit
of some one or being pursued. .
colonel. "That's where we'll find them,
if we find them at all."
The expression on her face as she knelt
beside the bed revealed a great deal to
Rose Goodwin.
â¢ Missus Jim made no reply. She had eyes
only for her patient, and he was holding
a thin hand out to greet her;.he knew her,
and that evidence enough that reason had
returned. . '
That cry! Surely that was her patient's
voice! She sped along the hall to .find
Rose standing at his bedside, speechless
with astonishment. Brockman was staring
at her in a puzzled way. â¢ Â«Â¦ . Â¦
â¢Rose turned upon her. "Who is this
man?' she cried. "This is not my hus
bandânor yours! Muggins said he was
here." " . . , Â¦ ' . - â¢Â¦ ' â¢
What did it all mean? she asked her
self. Could it be possible that her hus
band had come on to at last to Henrietta?
Husband? Had she called him that?
"Do?" said Rose. "Do as I Intend to
do â show him no mercy, sick or well.
Hound him; hound him to the very last."
, She darted from the room, and Missus
Jim heard her running along the hall. , A
door opened, and she heard a shriek of
laughter and the cry:
"Come on! ' Let Jim Goodwin look upon
both of his wives!"
"We were married * less than -eight
months ago," Missus Jim faltered. What
nightmare was this coming upon;. her
now? A dishonored woman! And for an
instant she almost rejoiced at the discov
ery! Her composure was gone on the in
stant. "What shall I do?" she moaned.
"What can I do?" , . .. â¢
"Are you crazy?" Rose asked. "Don't
you realize what this means to you? That
I am his, legal wife and that you never
have been? He left me penlless In San
Antonio a year agoâ and he .'must , have
gone at once to you." Â¦' \ '.-."â¢.Â¦ Â¦. '.-"-".â¢ '
"If he is your husband," Misses Jim
was thinking in a dazed way of the sick
man in the other room and of the effect
all this, if true, might- have upon their
livesâ "If he is your husband, take him.
I will not dispute possession with you.".
"I knew it â I knew it!" Rose screamed.
"My. husband!" â (she was mimicking
Missus Jim now)â "Why, you poor fool,
he's my husband, too; mine before yours!
God, but he shall suffer for this!" ,
"What I want to know," said Rose,
opening the locket and pointing to a pic
ture It contained, "is who. this, man is,
and what he is to you."
"That is the portrait of my husband,"
Missus Jim replied. '
"Name! Name! Give me his name!"
the other woman atmest shouted.
"Goodwinâ James Goodwin," she replied,
wondering at the demand. â¢ , â¢
"Come into my room, then," Missus
Jim said, leading the way to an apart
ment at the other end of the hall.
" 'Taint the money," said Rose, calmed
by the other's manner; " 'tain't the
money, but something else. 7 Go away,
Muggins. I won't hurt her, but 1 want
to talk to her alone.". \v- k
"It is worth many times what the wom
an I sold it to gave ms for ' it," said
Missus Jim, quietly. ; "But if she is not
satisfied she may have the earrings as
well. The money has been spent.';
"Where did you get this?" the woman
called Rose demanded to know,"tremb
ling: with excitement as she held out the
oval locket which had been sold only, a
little while before. "Where did you get
it? And who are you. anyway?"
"Ye can't go into that room," Muggins
was saying to some one out on the stairs.
"Ye can't go in there, Rose."
"Then call her out," a woman's voice
replied. "Call her out, or In I go, in
â¢spite of your whole ranch. Who is she,
that I'm not to talk to her? Trot her
out or there'll be trouble, I can tell you."
"Sh-sh," said Missus Jim, appearing in
the hall and raising a warning "linger.
"There's a very sick man in that room
and the slightest noise disturbs him.!' /'
Back with a double eagle instead of the
locket; the bills were paid, and she went
into the sickroom to watch and to wonder
how it ail would end. She never again
could live with the man who called her
wife; never had she loathed him so
much â not even when she. made the dis
tressing after-marriage discovery that the
self-styled ranchman who came courting
her for a second time in her Kentucky
home was in reality only a . gambler at
cards, that his "range" was the Texas
frontier, and that his "cattle" were the
troopers at the Government posts. She
could never a~a in' be as. a wife to .him.
And as soon as he became conscious and
strong she must leave this sick man; she
must get as far from him as possible, be
cause â because
Yet bills must be paid that the sick
might get well, and she must pay them.
All that remained were some bits of
jewelry, a large oval locket" and her ear
ringsâthings for which no man would
care. Here was greater proof of her pity
than all which had gone before, for to
sell these she would have to go among
the women of the town, and perhaps' be
jeered at and laughed at by them, and
told how Never mind; it had to be
done, and it was done.
. Not the gray, nor even the smallest
item of the cowboy's equipment would
she part with. As for the gray, she
visited him every day to be. certain that
his wants were attended to. She could
open her heart to him as she could open
it to no other living thing; she could
throw her arms about his neck and : tell
him that she â¢ loved . him and Icibs the
black star in his forehead; she Â¦ could do
and did these, thingsâ for had he not had
a part of her salvation? Sell him? She
would as soon think of selling her own
flesh and blood. . -
There came a Â¦ day when even that
which she had received for the wagon
was exhausted, and the need for money
was great and distressing. 'Â¦Â¦'.:.Â¦'Â¦ -

"Certainly it may," replies Dr. Jordan,
.*and fortunately so."
Lily Burch followed her husband, Louis
Allen, to New York, to Los Angeles, and
finally out on the desert to Indio through
his long suffering as a consumptive.
Nothing was of any avail. He left her a
widow with a splendid little son. She went
back to Stanford after her husband died,
saying that all her happy days had been
spent there and she could never leave it. Â¦
Two sad stories are those of Lily Burcb
and Alberta Merritt. Alberta was one of
the Kappa girls, a favorite of them, and
never did two people' love each other
better than she and Carl Clemens, the
great football hero of early days. After a
long engagement they were married and
went north; they had hardly, come to
realize how happy they were in their little
home when she died.
If marrying a professor Is properly
termed a co-educational match, then
Frances Rand and Anna Kohler belong in
the list. Miss Rand was a Pi Beta Phi
girl, who married Professor Smith. Anna
Kohler is now on a prolonged honeymoon
In Europe with her husband. Professor
Earl ' Barnes.
Mary Burke and Scott Calhoun were a
couple whom all Stanford watched during
the pioneer years. After graduating Mol
lle taught for a while, then they were
married.
Mary Holt, the witty Southern daughter
of an old Southern family, is married to
Walter Rose, the young lawyer, and has a
home here in San Francisco. There never
was a girl at Stanford who was quicker
at repartee than she, and her wit always
kept plenty of admirers in her train be
fore Walter Rose won out.
Evelyn Crow, one of the San Jose girls,
married Sam Simmons and has gone
abroad ' with him now while he studies
medicine.
Elizabeth Chapman was another of that
sorority who married after a college love
affair. She and Robert Donald now have
their home in Sacramento and there are
two little Donalds in the home. >
Harriet Buck, a Kappa Kappa Gamma,
likewise had adventures all because she
married. Herbert Stark took her to Jo
hannesburg, where they have been living
for a number of years now. They have
been in South Africa during the Boer war.
Lou Henry is one of the girls who have
left the cloisters of Stanford for an ad
venturous life. She and her husband,
Herbert Hoover, went to China, where
he turned his wonderful mining knowl
edge to good advantage. They were there
during the terrible Boxer siege, were re
ported Most more than once and finally
emerged with all sorts of heroism to their
credit.
Hilda MacLaughlin, noted for her
beauty and her height, the very tallest
girl of the '36 class, if not of the univer
sity, married Harry Gray and settled
down to domestic life In Oakland. Hilda
was the English girl with the bright Eng
lish coloring. Her home was in quiet
Victoria before she went to Stanford.
Dora Moody is another of the Thetas
who has gone the way of all girls. Tom
"Williams, the big center rush, was the
man responsible.'
Ruby was a sensational freshman whin
she entered, with her prettiness and her
clever wheeling. She slew hearts riglit

No wonder Stanford young people have
looked upon matrimony as one of their
courses of study. Illustrious examples lay
all around them.
During the first few years of the uni
versity's career, these affairs were In an t

'Probably there never was a love affair '
within the quadrangle that kept Interest
alive as steadily as that of Alice Cowen
and Guy Cochran. He was one of Stan- Â¦,
ford's darlings; he was a football hero ]

of these dlstinctions^alone, ought to have :

Alice appeared on the scene when the 'Â¦

She came to Stanford from a girls' sem

Into existence. Nor has their lovemaking
been forbidden fruit. Dr. Jordan's ap
proval has cone forth:
"Co-education may lead to marriage,
and fortunately so."
So the young people kept on spooning,
as they probably would have kept on any
way, whether it had been forbidden fruit
or not. However, it made it easy to know
that It was smiled upon Indulgently.
It would keep a psychologist busy to
analyze all the whys and wherefores of
this matrimonial spirit that has pervaded
Stanford so much more than other eo
educational Institutions. Of course the
students who go there are at a romantic
ape: but this holds good of other colleges
Just the same. Men and women students
ere taught In the eaxne classes; but Stan
ford is not unique in this, either.
For one thing, it Is located in a romantic
epot. A man is certainly more likely to
fall In love with a girl when he sees her
frn<r fluttering in a March breeze while
Ehe gathers a hat full of popples than he
would be if he came upon her picking her
way over a sloppy pavement or clutching
her hat in a wind that ruined her com
plexion. Girls are very picturesquely en
vironed at Stanford. They can.be found
In many foregrounds with hills and wild
flowers in the middle distance, and they
are often framed in arches. These girl-
Ecapes have proved too much for many a
man.
Another thing that counts is Stanford's
Isolation. Stanford young people are
thrown upon each other for society, and
acquaintance ripens.

Less than half a dozen people in the
whole city have ever seen Bennett. At
least the police have been unable to find
any others. Of these half dozen the po
lice have had to place their chief depend
ence for all their information about Ben-'
cett on Just four men. They are Fred
W. Krone, proprietor of the Popular Res
taurant, where Bennett dined quite regu
larly and where Nora Fuller kept her
fatal tryst with the man who is now be
ins hunted far and wide; E. B. Stengel
ct the Noonan Furniture Company, on
Mission street, near Sixth, and B. T.
Schell of J. C. Cavanaugh's. at 8<S Mis
sion street, from both of whom Bennett
tried to buy furniture: and.C. S. Leha
nier. the clerk at Umbsen &. Co.'s. from
v.-liom Bennett rented the Sutter-street
huuse. Upon the meager descriptions of
ihrsf. four men hang the whole sum and
s-ubstance of all that the police know
about Bennett. "With the exception of
3: rone none of them have ever seen the
suspected criminal more than once, or
twice.

has become more difficult of solution. In

Weeks and weeks have passed since
pretty Nora Fuller was murdered in the
tack room of the empty house at 2211 But
ter street, and because the police have
r.o pictures of the elusive and altogether
mysterious Bennett, upon whom the
atrocious deed has been fixed, he has baf
iied the efforts of the best sleuths of the
rhole continent to capture him. Long
before the denuded body of his frail vic
tim ~ was discovered by the young man
sent by L'mbsen & Co. to investigate the
reason why the house of. death was still
vnoccupied after it had been rented for
pearly a month, Bennett had disappeared.

Parts of These
Photographs That
"Look Like Bennett."
Those are all the essential points, but
so far they have proved absolutely-use
less for all practical purposes. With that
description alone to guide, them, thou
sands of professional and amateur sleutha
are working to get the big reward offered
for Nora Fuller's murderer. Scores of
men have been arrested or. kept .under
dose surveillance for weeks, Blmply be
cause they "look like Bennett." The best
detectives on the local fqree, even Includ
ing Captain Seymour himself, have. gone
scurrying up and down the coast and half
way across the continent and back' again
to identify suspects who "look like Ben
nett." only to find that the zealous police
had arrested the wrong man. ln'or.e.or
two instances the man who '"looks like
Bennett" has turned the tables on his
captors, as in the case of . the ovcrconii
dent amateur detective down south" who
is now serving sixty days for false im
prisonment because he followed a man
who "looked like. Bennett" for two days
and finally, after a desperate encounter,
brought him back* to* Jail by main force.
It is to prevent just such expensive mis
takes as these as well as to give the po
lice of every city and town In the West
something tangible to work on that ;the
four chief witnesses against Bennett have
selected these, photographs . that "look
like Bennett." As the police point out,
' Bennett's face . is in no sense the ' accept
ed criminal type which they declare is
the reason he is so hard to catch." And
Â¦because, too, his description fits so many
"Bennett's height is about five feet and
seven Inches; weight about 160 pounds.
Has excellent teeth, slightly prominent;
mustache of brownish color,' chin rather
longâ as la also his face.. Has a decided
cast in his right eye, the eyelid of which
droops slightly. His hands, always in
good condition, favor the tdea that he has
never done any manual labor. He walks
with a military swing, takes long strides
and appears to be a 'man belonging to
some profession, being studiously inclined.
Is always well dressed, usually in black
Prince Albert coat or long black overcoat
Â¦with Derby or silk hat. He Is between
35 and 40 'years old."
It is for this reason that the police have
been searching everywhere for a good
photograph of Bennett or of a man who
"looks like Bennett," to send out to sup
plement their description of the mur
derer. Ca'ptain Seymour has more than
once ceciared that such a picture is of
paramount importance, for many serious
blunders have been made from the de
scriptions that have been telegraphed all
over the country:
The police themselves declare that men
who could never recognize Bennett from
the descriptions sent out broadcast, even
though they should see him every day,
would know him at a glance after seeing
his photograph, or a good picture of a
man who "looks like Bennett." There
is n6 better me"ans of identification known
to criminology. No matter what changes
the fugitive may make in his hair or
beard or clothes, the tell-tale expression
of his eyesâ the shape and contour of his
face shown with absolute fidelity by the
camera â never changes. i,-Sj
Of course, none of these pictures look
exactly like Bennett. That would be Im
possible, for in all the world there are
no two persons who look precisely alike.
But according to these four men who
know Benr.ett best the pictures they have
selected show the chief characteristics of
his face, and serve to give a good idea
of the peculiarities of the features which
cannot be gained by any one, even those
trained to the ; work, from mere descrip
tion.
same mental impression from the -same
description, these four men have selected
the pictures on this page for The Sunday
Call from hundreds of other photographs
of men who answer the police descrip
tion, to show just what type of face Ben
nett has and help the detectives in their
quest.

The fed originated in New York, but it
has caught the Western fancy, and the
photo-etchings of the six society women
shown on this page are the very first to
be made up here. Needless to say that,
like most society fads, the new pictures
cost a heap of money, a sir.g'.e portrait

same characteristics without knowing TJl
The tension of the identifications had In
creased tremendously. Would B. T. Schell
make the same selections from the big
pile of photographs? Once again they
were shuffled together before they were
shown to him at Cavanaugh's.
He spread them out on the wide coun
ter and went over them slowly, studying
each picture carefully. After he had
looked them all over he picked up No. 5
and said unhesitatingly i '? Uf
"This picture looks most like Bennett
of any in the bunch. In fact, lt'Â» more
like him than any I have ever seen.
Why? W T ell. it's got the same shape of
chin and the mustache â the mustache
especially. This picture's (No. 2) got
more the shape of Bennett's faceâ the
cheek bones and eyes â was there a cast
in his eye? Well. I didn't notice any.
This picture (No. 4) shows the shape of
Bennett's chin better and, yes, this (No.
3) is like Bennett's figure, and the nose
in this picture No. 6) is Bennett's, but
it's the mustache and the general ex
pression In this picture (No. 5) that
makes Bennett most easily remembered.
"The othera have selected these same
pictures. Great Scott! You don't say
so. Well, they ought to catch him from
these.'%i â¢*â¢Â¦
"The nose of this picture (No. 6) and
the eyes and brow of this (No. 2) com
bined with the whole lower face and
mustache of this picture (No. 5) would
show exactly the type of face Bennett
has. so that he could be recognized any
where. This (No.i; is about the same as
Bennett's figure."
To have two of the chief witnesses
against Nora Fuller's slayer pick out pre
cisely the same pictures to illustrate the
type of face Bennett has, without either
of them knowing what selections the
other had made, was exciting to a de
gree and no less surprising tÂ» the men
themselves when they found that their
ldentflcatlons were alike. It seemed
hardly possible that the third manâ E. B.
Stengel of Noonan's Furniture Company
âwould do the same thing after the pile
of photographs were all shuffled up again,
but that is what he did. with even great
er certainty, if anything, than Krone and
Lahanler had shown in their selections.
He went over more than half the group
before he finally paused with the picture
of No. 2.1n his hand. No. 5 he threw aside
at first, as. if It had not impressed him
more than any of the Â¦ others, but after
making one or two selections at the bot
tom of the pile he said:
"This picture (No. 2) shows almost ex
actly the same shape of face as the man
I saw, whom the police tell me Is Bep
nett, except that the cheeks are a little
fuller, but this picture . (No. 5) has the
chin and mustache and the nose i like
Bennett's. The resemblance Is remark
ably strong. I don't know exactly what
It was that Impressed me, but I should
know Bennett's face again anywhere.
This. (No. 3) is like Bennett's figure, but
It Is on my memory of his featuresâ that
long face and the full carefully trimmed
mustacheâ that I should depend most to
identify him." â¢ > -^

"All watches keep better time as thÂ»
result of regular habits. Don't lay it
down one night and hang It /up the next.
Keep It in the same position as nearly as
circumstances will permit. In second- ,
class watches the rate of difference be
tween the horizontal and vertical position
Is often quite significant. Nor should you
hang your watch on a nail where It can
swing to and fro like a pendulum. It will
either gain or lose a great deal while In
that position.
"The difference In temperature between
your breast or a man's waistcoat pocket t
and a wall, that may bo nearly at the ;
freezing point. Is about 77 to S3 degrees
Fahrenheit, and a watch should therefore
never be suspended -or laid airainst a cold
surface. Sudden changes in tRe tempera
ture of the atmosphere are the causes of
most > mainsprings breaking. The watch
wearer should clean his or her pockets
frequently,. carefully brushing out all dust
and fiber, for there was never a Joining
made tight enough to keep out all the
dust. This gets into the oil, which has
thickened with time, and necessarily pro
duces' irregularities of. rate. Even with
the greatest care a watch should be
cleaned once in eighteen months and every
year would be better. By this time the
oil dries up and mixes with metallic dust;
it grinds away on the works like emery.
When I tell you that a watch ticks 3S8.
800 times in one day you can comnute the
gigantic task It performs in a year. Treat
your watch reasonably and It will appre
ciate such care and will serve yoa faith
fully as a friend in need."â Washington
Star. -
"Take, for Instance, the simple process
of winding a watch. There is a right and
a wrong way. of doing Jt. Whether it be
by key or a stem. It should be wound In
the morning. Turn slowly and avoid all
jerky movements. The watch will then
work best during the day. as the spring
will exert Its strongest traction power,
whereby the external jostllngs Inflicted on
the watch by your dally works and walks
are fairly well counterbalanced. When a
watch Is wound at night it has only the
weakened spring to offer as resistance to
the jerks and Jolts of the daytime. The
morning winding also lessens the danger
of breaking the mainspring', which, being
no longer at full tension at night, can
stand the cold better.

"My Lady Peggy ' Goes to Town," by
Frances Aymar Mathaws, Is a romantic
novel laid in England during the days of
Beau Brummel. The great Brummel
plays a part in the story, but the main
character, of course, !s My Lady Peggy.
The story recounts the adventures of this
dashing young maid who coquettes with
her true love and finally goes to London,
where she dons male attire and passes
herself off asÂ« Sir Robin McTartâ an in
significant chap, who Is also a> suitor for
her hand. In this guise she gets into a
quarrel with her lover Percy and is
wounded by. a sword thrust. She also has
sundry other adventures through the com
ing to town of the real Robin McTart, an
episode with highwaymen and various
otlwr unpleasant incidents that are apt to
find young women who insist upon going
about in the guise ot man. Of course, It
is easy to guess how the story will end
long before the tale Is half done. There
Is a certain amount of pleasure to be de
rived from the book In following the ad
ventures of the capricious Mistress
Peg^y;'. but the same line of fancy In the
way of women assuming the masculine
role has . been worked out many a time
before and* has been better done. The
story is readable, but rather long drawn
out. (Published by the Bowen-Merrill

-Those interested in physical culture for
children will find food for thought In a
email volume entitled. "Graded Physical
Exercises," by Bertha Louise Colburn,
that has just been published by the Edgar
S. Werner Company of New York. ThÂ©
first'part of the book is devoted to a sys
tem of exercises, to be given In an or
dinary room without apparatus. The sys
tem is divided into eight grades, one set
for each year of school life. Each group
is a natural outgrowth frop the preced
ing one, the principle that only from the
frequent repetition of a movement benefit
can be derived being carried , consistently
out, though each group Is complete In
itself. The exercises suited to adult de
velopment begin with grade V, continuing
through the series. The system Is not
merely .theoretical, but It Is practical,
having been tested by the author In six
years' use in public schools and acade
mies. Little talks" to the teacher
in shape of a short nature story or an
artistic story planned for the teacher to
tell her little ones accompany the work
of the first and second grades. The re
mainder of the book Is given over to
marching and . tactics, games, minute
plays and action poems, grouped Into
grades like the preceding chapters. (Price

An enthusiastic tribute to the talents "and

paid by Solon Lauer in a sketch which he
has written of the Senator. | The book' Is
not only a j eulogy of Mr. S Hanna, . but a

upon the real meaning .'of anarchism,

of^ Mr. Hanna'B career. In this are intro
duced'selections; from addresses made by
Mr. Hanna and several articles which
have appeared ' in ) the magazines . about
him. The book closes with a number of
short essays on; social; and political ques
tions.. The essays are' a plea for the su
premacy principles which Mr. : Lauer . finds
exemplified, in the career. of Senator Han
na. Mr. Lauer's, estimate of the policy
of Hanna may ' be seen in the following
quotation from the book: >

jj The somberhess of the mJfln romance is
prettily offset by. the lighter love story
of Angus MacLean and the Quaker maid,
Mistress Truelove Taberer. MacLean's
friendship for Haward, cemented as it is
in blood by their duel over Audrey, is
one of the most vital â¢ features of the^
story. Audrey's seeking refuge from the'
cruelty of gossip by adopting a life on the
stage and her sudden rise to a position of

He sat heavily down beside Audrey, who
never stirred from her still regard of that high
window. There was a moment of portentous
silence; then "Let us pray," said the minis
ter from the pulpit. ' .
He turned his great, shambling body and
heavy face toward the preacher, stemmed -in
the full tide of his eloquence by . this unseemly
interruption. "Ye beggarly Scot !" he ex
claimed, thickly. "Ye evil- thinking saint from
Salem way, that know the very lining of the
Lord's mind, and yet, walking - through ; .his
earth, see but a poisonous weed in his every
harmless ftp wer ! Shame on you to beat down
the flower that never did you harm! The girl's
as Innocent a thing as lives! Ay, I've had
my dramâ the more shame to you that are
justly rebuked out of the mouth of a drunken
man! I have done. Mr. Commissary," address
ing himself to that dignitary, who had ad
vanced to the altar, rail with his arm raised
in a command for silence. "I've no child of
my own, thank God! but the maid has grown

less of wrong as any lady here. I, ' Gideon

The poor girl goes, much against her
will. Decked out In theatrical' finery fur

fall heavier later, whcn ; Haward insists
upon taking Audrey to the ball. â¢ /
The Highlander, who had , become very
thoughtful of aspect since entering . the ; room,
and who had not shared Saunderson' s* start
of surprise *at the master's latest; orders, nod
ded assent. Haward stood for a, moment gaz
ing steadily at Hugon. but with no notice to
bestow upon -the bowing, schoolmaster; then
walked over ; to tjie harpsichord, and, Bitting
down, began . to play an old tune, ; soft and
slow.'-, with . pauses between ; the notes. .When
he came 'to the final chord . he ; looked over his
shoulder at - the colonel, : standing before Â¦' the
mantel with his eyes , upon . the flre. ''So they
have gone,"- he ' said. ;Â¦ "Good riddance! A
pretty 1 brace of villains!" ; .
With a Blight bow, to his guest he left the
window and advanced to , the- group, in the
center of the room.. "Saunderson,": he said
abruptly, "take these two men to : the quarter
and cut their bonds. Give/them a; start of
fifty yards, then loose the dogs and hunt. them
from the â¢ plantation.: You -have . men outside
to help you? /Very well, go! Mr. , MacLean,'

therefore, colonel, I am about to dismiss the
case." . ' ' ' Â¦Â¦- Â¦ :'*:Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦. '
The other met his stare of surprise with an
Imperturbable countenance. "What ; I Isay,"
he answered â¢ quietly. "My servants find two
men lurking. 'beside a road that I am travel
ing. Being somewhat overzealous, they take
them ud on suspicion of meaning mischief
and bring them before me. It Is all guesswork
why they were at , the turn of Ahe road Â¦ and
what they wanted there. There is no proof,

"I see that th"ere is no witness that, you

said, with a gesture of Impatience. "There is

"No proof!" exclaimed hiÂ» guest, sharply.
"You mean â â "
Colonel Byrd went up to Haward and spoke
in a low voice: "Best send them , at once to

Kaward pushed back his chair â¢ from , the
table, and, rising,' walked, across the. room
to the window. Hugon followed hjm, strain

thickly. , Hls\. eyes were glaring, his " teeth
bared. When he was so close that the Vir
ginian could feel his hot breath, the latter
turned, and, uttering an oath of: disgust,
struck the back of his hand across his lips.
With the cry of. an' animal, Hugon, bound
as he was, threw himself bodily upon his foe,
who in turn flung the trader from him with
a violence that sent. him reeling against' . the
wall. Here Saunderson, a man of powerful
build, seized him by the shoulders, holding
him fast; MacLeen, too, hurriedly crossed
from the door. There was no need, for the
half-breed's frenzy was spent. He stood with
glittering eyes following Haward'B every mo
tion, but quite Bilent, his frame rigid in the
overseer's grasp. .
far awry, his great peruke, a, cataract of hair,

words in a strange tongue, the tongue of his
mother. Of what was he speaking, . what was

was a savage giving voice to madness and

broke with jiasslon. "I am of the noblesse

If Haward heard it did not appear.- He' was
leaning back In his chair, v his eye? fixed upon
the trader's twitching face In a cold and smil
ing regard. "Well, Monacan?" he demanded/
From the fireplace came [ the schoolmaster's
slow voice: "Dear sir, can you show the pit?
Why should this youth desire to harm you?
Where is the storm b'.rd? Can you whistle it
before a Justice of the Peace or into a court
room?" ';â¢':.â}.'.
Haward laughed. "No, it was not Audrey.
And so. Monacan, you have yourself fallen
into the pit which you digged." Â¦
"Was it Audrey?"
"A storm bird," said Haward, calmly.
"Okee is perhaps angry with his Monacans
and eent it."
The trader, gasping with passion. leaned
across the table until his eyes were within a
foot of Haward's unmoved face. â¢ "Who
showed you the trail and told you of the
snare?" he whispered. "Tell me that, you
Englishman â tell me that!"
"For a handful of- blue beads," said Ha
ward. with a cold smile. "And I, dog of an
Indian! I will send a Nottoway to teach
the Monacans how to lay a snare and hide
a trail."
Haward went on evenly: "Your tribe has
smoked the peace pipe with the white man.
I was not told it by singing birds, but by the
great white father at Willlamsburgh. They
buried the hatchet very deep; the dead leaves
of many mood of Cohonks lie thick upon the
place where they burled It. Why have you
made a warpath, treading it alone of your
color?"
"Diable!" cried Hugon. "Pig of an English
man! I will kill you for "
of distinction. His great wig, 'of a 'fashion
years gone by. ' was pulled grotesquely aside,
ebowlng the high forehead and shaven crown
beneath; his laced coat and tawdry waistcoat
and ruffled ehirt were torn and foul with mud
and mold, but the man himself made fo be
forgotten the absurdity of his trappings. Gone,
for him, were his captors, his accomplice, the
spectator in gold and russet; to Haward, also,
sitting very' cold., very quiet, with narrowed
eyes, they were gone. He was angered, and
In the mood to give rein after his own fashion
to that anger. MacLean and the master of
Westover. the overseer and the schoolmaster,
were forgotten, and he and Hugon met alone
as they might have met In the forest. Â¦ Be
tween them, and without a spoken word, the
two made this fact to be recognized by the
other occupants of the drawing-room. Colonel
Byrd, who had been standing with his hand
upon the 'table, moved backward until he
joined MacLcan beside the closed door; Kaun
derson drew near to the schoolmaster, and the
center of the room was left to the- would-be
murderer and the victim that had escaped
him.
"Monsieur le Monacan," said Haward.
Hugon snarled like an angry wolf and
strained at the rope which bound his arms.

him as Mr. Twain, until his Identity has
assumed a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde dual

he Is Mark Twain or Samuel Clemens.
It remained for the ever-ingenious office
boy to carry the dual identity j theory to f"
Its utmost development. Mr, Clemens
called at a publishing house, bat & man
he wanted to see was absent. To make
sure that his visit should be reported, and
having no card with him. he gave both
his names to the office boy. This was

"Bradish's Stories of Country Life." by
Sarah Powers Bradish, is one of the
latest additions to the series of Eclectic
School Readings. The stories are suitable
for reading- in the fourth or fifth yeara.
It presents in easy manner the yearly
round of country life on a farm, with
especial reference to the history of
wheat, from its planting to Its grinding
into flour at one of the great modern
mills. Into this general framework are
interwoven narratives of horses and dogs,
birds and little wild animals, describing
traits that may be watched and verified
by any observant child. To lend variety
to the themes and to give a broader view
of industrial life, among the farm stories
are scattered others relating to lumber-
Ing, coal, and iron mining, and the indus
tries to which they give rise. (Published
by the American Book Company, New
York. Price 40 cents.)
Stories of Country Life.
His sase was upon Hugon, who in his turn
rlered at him alone. Haward had the subtle
power of forcing and fixing the attention of
a company; In crowded rooms, without undue
utterance or moving from his place, he was
?pt to achieve the center of the stage, the
hÂ«-ad of the table. ICow, the half-breed, by
very virtue of the passion which, false to
h!x Indian b'.nod. thook him like a lear, of a
rs?e tvl-.ich overmastered and transformed,
reached et a bound the Englishman's plane
The character of Hugon is the shadow
of the story, and Its possibilities are splen
didly developed. He Is depicted as the son
of a reprobate French nobleman and en
Indian woman, and as is often, bo in such
c&see, be seems to have inherited the
worst from the character of each parent.
He plana, with the aid of the school
master, a transported criminal, to kill
Haward. but is prevented J by a timely
warning from Audrey. Haward has the
teacher and the halfbreed captured and
brought before him, but is obliged to let
the matter rest without further prosecu
tion, for he dislikes to bring forward the
name of Audrey as his witness. The scene
between Hugon and Haward is one of the
most powerful In the book and strongly
reminiscent of Miss Johnston's dramatic
work in "To Have and to Hold."
Naturally Haward remembers his guar
dianship of the girl and eoon begins to
take an Interest which rapidly develops
Into love. A halfbreed trader, Jean Hu
gon, also aspires for the hand of Audrey,
but Is cordially bated by her.
It is at this time that the Mayday fes
tival takes place and Haward sees Audrey
again. She Is one of the contestants in a
footrace and wins the prizeâ certainly a
lowly beginning for a heroine who is to
have so great a rival as the charming
Evelyn Byrd.
When Haward returns to his Virginian
estates he has well nigh forgotten the lit
tle maid whose life he saved. At this time
he asks Miss Evelyn Byrd to become his
wife and is promptly refused, for by his
own admission he offered his hand merely
because of the fitness of such a match and
not because of ardent love. '
Darden is cursed by a love for the flow
ing- bowl and does none too much for the
education of Audrey. She Is thrown large
ly upon her own resources, for the minis
ter's wife is a shrewish woman, entirely
lacking in the finer sympathies that mlgnt
appeal to so sensitive a nature as that
of Audrey.
Like its predecessors, the present story
is laid in Virginia, but at a later date
in the eighteenth instead of the seven
teenth century. Audrey 1b an orphan who
has been saved as a child from the In
dians by Mr. Marmaduke Haward, one of
A'irginia's wealthiest -and highest born
young men. Haward provides for her by
leaving her In the charge of the minister,
Darden, while he himself goes to London
to see a bit of the world.
The plot of the novel is by no means
involved, but Miss Johnston more than
makes up for any interest lost through
that medium by the intensity of her char
acter drawing. There are a half dozen or
more characters In this book that well de
serve to play leading roles in a' story all
their own.
The first few chapters of "Audrey" will
make rather dry reading for those who
expect one dramatic Incident to follow an
other and find narrative much more to
their palate tban description. Miss John
ston begins her work deliberately and
takes her own time to do a certain
amount of landscape gardening to insure
a proper setting for her drama. Sne con
tinues this plan throughout the book, it
must be said, and at no time allows the
stress of narration to Infringe upon the
prerogatives of the scene shifter. Her pic
tures, when all is set and ready, are cer
tainly as delightful as could be desired,
but at times may be found to interfere
with the dramatic rights of the story \n
much the same way that a series of
tableaux introduced into a melodrama
might be detrimental if allowed to break
the thread of action.
Audrey Is a heroine that deserves to
lire among the heroines of fiction. Miss
Johnston seems to have been in perfect
sympathy with this child of the woods.
She makes her Audrey, for the reader, a
living, breathing personality. The other
characters of the book are equally well
ione, but being of more ordinary clay,
they naturally do not attract the same
amount of attention as this dreamy child
of nature who. as a type, is so distinct
and apart from the rest of the world.
"Audrey** will, of course, be onÂ© of the
big sellers of the year, but whether it
will really appeal bo strongly to her read
ers as did her other works is a question.
It has not the dash, concentration and
"good ending" that go to make a book
popularly popular. Tet, It is undoubtedly
her best work.
â¢:
THE novel that holds center position
at present In public libraries, book
dealers' show windows and on the
tables' of up-to-date readers is, of
course, Mary Johnston's "Audrey."
"Prisoners of Hope" started the wave of
popular favor that attained full power
when "To Have and to Hold" appeared,
and Is now booming' merrily along bear
ing on ita crest this latest work of a fa
vorite author. The general opinion at
present ecmB to be that Miss Johnston has
"improved"â that is. from a critic's stand
point. She is, in "Audrey," more careful
about dealing in improbable and dra
matic Incidents that were found fault
â¢with In "To Have and to Hold." She
writes with a more mature pen.
the series is an admirable work on "Medi
eval Rome" from Hildebrand to Clement
.Mil, 1073-1600, by William Miller, M. \
Mr. Miller Is also the author of "Xhj
Ralkans." etc. He has done careful and
conscientious work on the present book,
ard the volume will be foumi of the'
greatest value to those who wish to brush
up. their knowledge of the history o ; t^' e
Eternal City between the middle of the
eleventh and the end of the sixteenth cen
tury.
Mr. Miller treats his subject under the
following heads: "Hildebrand and His
Times," "Arnold of Brescia," "Innocent
III and the Zenith of the Papacy," "The
Hermit-Pope and the First Jubilee,' .f
"Rome During the 'Babylonish Captiv- *
Ity.* " "The Return of the Papacy," "The
Age of Aeneas Sylvius," "The Papacy of
Alexander VI," "Rome Durfnff the Re
naissance," "The Sack of Rome," "The
Inquisition and the Jesuits," "Rome Un
der Slxtus V." The illustrations of the
book deserve special mention, for there
are a great many of them, and all a*e
excellent reproductions of valuable photo
graphs. A complete alphabetical index
adds much to the practical convenience
of the volume. (Price $1 50.)

"Principals and teachers should employ
other restraining influences, but if they
prove ineffectual corporal punishment
should be administered in a proper man

the hand. In every school there will ap
pear occasionally cares which can be
reached in no . other way. Suspension
from school, while it might with many be
regarded as a humiliation and a disgrace,
would be by others used as. a vacation.
Expulsion from school often* means the
destruction of the individual for future
usefulness. Excluded from the discip'ine
and instruction of the schoolroom, a boy
who has demonstrated that he is to some
extent incorrigible will very likely, given
his freedom, contract vicious and idle
habits, and good citizenship will be lost to
the Btate. Therefore I believe in the in

who are not disposed to be controlled In

"I believe in keeping corporal punish

we average about thirty cases a montU
with between 500 and bOu boys. There u^j
some boys beneflted by corporal punish
ment reasonably administered.
â¢"However, I wouid be In favor of abol
ishing corporal punishment, let the conse
quences be wnat they may. I say tnla
because mistakes are sometimes made in
administering corporal punishment. On
cannot always understand the disposition
of the child, and there may be cases
where punishment is remembered wun
bitterness in after years.
â¢ "Another bad feature of corporal pun
ishment is that there are timid chiidre i
in school who are frightened and terrifiej
by the thought of it. Of course, we never
punish in fne presence of the class, but
they know of it, and the timid child con
stantly fears he may do something that
will cause him to be punished.
"I think discipline could be maintained
without it. because znmre responslb.lity
would be thrown on the parents, and in
time the thought of being turned out of

have a deterrent influence on most boys

punish.
- JAMES T. HAMILTON, .: â¢ -
Principal of Lincoln Grammar
School.
"Well, yes, in certain case3 corporal
punishment is necessary; for instance,
where a boy defies the authority of teach
ers and principal and sets himself above
the law,* as he can do in many ways. ,
"As for truancy, that" is an open ques
tion just now. It depends on whether you
have the support' of the parents. It
doesn't do much good unless things are
I made uncomfortable for the boy at both
ends of the line. If his parents write, an
excuse when I know the boy has been
playing truant, whipping will not cure the
boy of truancy.
"As to whether teachers should be al
lowed to punish, I would say some should
and' some should not, -and it is hard to
draw the line. . It is necessary for the vice
principal -to have authority to punish
when he has charge of the boys in the
yard, otherwise they would not respect
his authority.
"No, indeed, I do not* believe corporal
punishment should be abolished. It was
tried here once and we had a terrible
time, and had to go back to it. Parents
do not want it abolished and I know of
no leaders in educational matters who
advocate I the abolishment of corporal
punishment. There are people who have
beautiful theories on the subject; but if
we can govern without corporal punish
ment, why not govern without Jails and
penitentiaries?
"In the discretion of the principal it
might be wise to give teachers author
ity to punish, and this is allowed in the
lower grades; but teachers as a rule do
not want the privilege. They prefer to
let the principal do the whipping.
"Host parents feel that while their chil
dren are in school they should be untier
the authority of teacher and principal.
That is right. The school should havi
absolute authority in its own province;
and by Its not having this power many
children are upon the street who should
be in school."
I do not think it would" be wise to
abolish corporal punishment. We would
have to substitute something else that
would not be of benetit to the child. The
choice is between suspension, expulsion
from school and corporal punishment. I
do not resort to suspension, as I do nnt
think it is efficacious. I believe children
should be kept in school, and corporal
punishment judiciously administered
serves to keep many boys from the" street.
"It is no pleasure to .any one to punish
a child, and I think parents should be
grateful to principals for not turning the
boy3 out of school when- they have tha
option of suspension and punishment.
"Cases of truancy I report to the par
ent, or. If necessary, to the truant oill
cer; but I sometimes punish for tardi
ness. There are many cases where par
ents ask us to punish the children; but
if they do not wish it. then we have lo
find some other way. i
; "I think corporal punishment is more
necessary among smaller children. Above
the sixth grade children have sense
enough to know what they come tj
school for. There are some little girU
that I think would be- beneflted by cor
poral punishment.
MRS. FRANCES A. BANNING,

, "I believe boys should be whipped, but
not brutally whipped. It is not so much
the severity of the. whipping which does
good as the humiliation it causes. I look
back to a beMing I once got and have
never forgotten. I was whipped very
brutally, and Instead of looking up to
the man who did it, I only think he was
_a brute.
"It was a peculiar affair, as I 3ee it
now. The teacher had told each one of
us to write a letter at home and bring
it to school. When I read mine she said
it was not my own work; that I had had
help. I told her I had not, and she said
to me. 'You lie." Boylike, I said 'You
lie back.* She sent for the principal, wfio
is still in the department, and he gave
' me a. beating which I felt I deserved no
more than the teacher.
-' "I don't believe any good ever came
from beating a boy brutally; but for
those who prove incorrigible, there is no
doubt about the : necessity of corporal
punishment. I think this should be re
stricted to blows 'on / the hand with the
,} rattan or strap. If it is right to take a
boy and whip him uatil he is black and
blue, then it would 'be just as Tight to
go further than that, if. he does not be

"There is very little corporal punishment

. that women punish more than men.
Here are opinions gathered from people
interepted in school work. The principals
quoted represent every district from Tele
graph Hiil to Pacific Heights, from the
center of town to the Mission, covering
the various conditions which affect the
question of corporal punishment In tne
schools. Â»â¢*â¢
It is hinted that the rules in regard to
corporal punishment may be revised. It
is whispered that in the next revision the
Board of Education may consult with the
principals as to what methods would be
conducive of best results.
There are those who think it a cruel
-shame that the teacher is not allowed to
1-iUjieh; thut the only thing she can do Is
to send the child to the principal, who
may or may not believe in whipping. In
reply there are those who say that the
teacher against whom the offense is com
mitted is not the proper one to administer
punishment. Â¦ ;
Whtn the matter is up to the principal
there comes the question of how far the
parent will support him. Some parents
say "Whip." others say "Hands off."
In a case where teacher can't, principal
don't and parent won't, what is to be
done?
Boys are doing ail these things to
day, and girls, too, for that matter. They
seem like little things to you, perhaps,
but tliut is because you are not a teacher
v.hose business it is to make a half-hun
dred or more restless, wriggling young
eurs sit_upj.ike little wopdenjmaÂ«ea and
ao notning "out study and recite.
Every oay of the year boys are being
whipped for doing these things. Now and
again or.e boy's whipping attracts par
â¢..culii.r Attention, and then people begin
to asK, tnould boys be whipped at school? '
Hy whom? How? Why?
These are big questions with many an
t rs. . . .
What did you do? Why, you shot notes
across the aisle, scraped your feet on the
floor, acted the clown when the teacher
wasn't looking and some othei- boy was;
you whispered and pinched your seat
mate or the boy in front ot you, you
i. .. a;ii-<-c marbits, made faces, told sto
ries, played "hockey." foughtâ in fact,
what didn't you do?
"Havin' fun" covers everything from
spitballs to staying away from school
with no one's permission, and no excuse
next day. You who were boys when you
were little and those of you who were
and not too goody-goody, just go
to the days when you kinked your
knees under those low desks with the
stiff, hard seats.
Ask any schoolboy why he gets whipped
at school and he will answer, "for havin'
fun."
Th<- rod has always had an honored
l.lace as a factor in school discipline. In
early days in San Francisco, as else
where, <t was usea without stint, without
fear, without favor. Then came a time
when it was not permitted to punish girls
by whipping. Then came a rule providing
that only principals or vice principals
shouid admihister corporal punishment.
This was followed by rules limiting the
tr.ethods of punishment to the use of rat
tan or strap, such punishment to be re
sorted to only in extreme cases, when all
other means fail. There is a special
ciause that no excessive, cruel or unusual
ptmistuaeat shall be allowed.
While all this has been taking place
boys have kept on being boys. Boys are
the sarr.e to-day, yesterday, forever.
there are from 7M to 900 boys
whipped during each school year in San

These negretos are the very lowest of
oil the Filipinos. You know there are
three ranks among them. To be a TagÂ«x
log is to be dead swell. They are the oÂ«ily
ones that have any education. Then
there are the Head Hunters. They are
a fierce ]pt, all right. Gee. but they can
fight. And the poor negretos are the low
est of all. They haven't any kind of ?du
cation, not even a Filipino one, and they
live in any kind of a shack that they
can throw together, and they don't wear
much more than a ruffle and a pompa
dourâyou ought to see their pompadours.
They have woolly kind of hair that they
ptll straight, up in the air and it stands
uiÂ» like a bush ou top of their heads. I
Down at Baler we were- stationed right
out among the negretos. and they were
a I' the society we hi*l except bullets for
all that time It couldn't exactly oe
called high life to liv/? among the negre
tos. Gee! You ought to see them. They
are the worst ever. "No. I won't exactly
say that, because they, were good fellows
to us. all right, all right. I had a little
sweetheart among themâ I'll* teil you
about her after a while. > x \\
As for food, we were v.'eli enough offâ
that is, as the army goes. We had noth
ing to complain of in regard to rations.
We couldn't cat any of tne Filipino food.
You ought to see itâ they eat a kind of
potato that seems to be made of' ropes
twisted together. And the messes they
mix. A civilized man can't get along en
any such chow as that. And. thank
goodness, v.-e didn't have to try it. We
got our rations regularly enough and they
were about all the comfort we had. And
even then a man will remember his wife's
biscuit and his mother's pies and his
grandmother's doughnuts once in a while.
It don't do any good to remember these
things, though, and after all it may be a
good thing to do without them for a
while. You enjoy them all the better
when you get back to them.
Company H (my company) of the Twen
;y-s<?cond Regiment, was sent down there
for the purpose of attending to whatever
there was doing. When we went we didn't
know what we v, r ere in for, of course. A
man never does know in this - business.
Maybe we wouldn't have been eo smart
about it if we had realized what It meant.
How would you like that? You fellows
that have been, in San Francisco with
pretty girls flying around as thick as
Filipino bulletsâ what do you think of
that? Fourteen months without a sight
of one of them. 1 guess San Francisco
looked pretty nice to me when T got
back. After fourteen months' like those a
fellow could put in fourteen more just
rubbering at the girls here. He'd think
an old ladies' home was worth flirting
v.ith.
Five months without mail and fourteen
months without the sight of a white wo
man.
Fourteen months â you can't realize
what it means unless you happen to have
been sent up to San Quentin at some time
in your life. No, you can't realize it even
then. You had pretty good cooking
thereâ not that I ever tried it. nor ' you
citherâ and you could see people from
outside, perhaps, and get letters. What
do you think we had to stand?
You can't think of it. You can't real
ize what it means to a lot of homesick
fellows. The times we were fighting were
the only periods of relief that we had.
A fellow just wants to get right into the
thick of it. It gives him something that
he has to think about and it helps him
to forget the people at home and the din
ners that he used to have and the canned
stuff that he has now.
We looked forward to a tight like hun
gry men to a meal.
Fourteen monthsâ think of that!
We had a pretty lonesome time in Ba
ler, I can tell you that. It's the most re
mote point in the islands. It lies on the
eastern coast of Luzon, miles from any
thing Uke civilization, end we were sta
tioned there for fourteen months.
*jt jr Y experiences at Baler you
/A/I want to know about? Oh. say.
I V I 1 didn't have any experiences.
I We just fought a little, that's
allâ that is. my men did. I tell
you wbat. they're a good lot. When a
private comes to a man and says. "Let
me so first, captain"â well, that's the
kind of a thins that a man never for
gets. That's the kind of stuff that Com
pany H is made of.
I tell you I promoted those men as fast
es I got a chance and . as far, I made
sergeants of- the lot of thimâ promoted
them for bravery, and they deserved It if
ever men did. ' That's the kind of stuff
we have in Company H f . â¢. * â¢â¢-. ..;>
And our men licked them. What do you
think'of that? Licked them. Five against
twenty, and they licked them.
1 guess they kept those men of ours
dancing line hens on a hot gridiro^ Think
of feeling bullets popping up all-around
you as thick as corn in the popper. Be-,
sides that,, they were coming in from aa
sides. .
Rather a new /kind of warfare! wasn't
It? There aren't many fights carried on
through the floor. But it was a corking
chance for the Filipinos and, they made
the most of it.
All of a sudden they were very much
taken by surprise. A snap and a crash
andâ gee, if those Filipinos hadn't crawled
under the house into the cellar, and they
were shooting up through the. floor.
The Filipinos kept up the hottest kine!
of fight, potting away through the frons
of the house, the baok of it, the doors and
the windowsâ any place they could find
to shcot through. Our men kept on the
same way and they must have been - still
hotter about it, for they didn't fall, not
a man of them.
Those twenty Filipinos had crackerjack;
of weapons. They, were armed to the
teeth with Mausers and Krag Jorgensen?
and our fellows weren't a patch on them
in the way of equipment. But that never
feazed the men of H. They weren't' tha.
kind.
' And they did fight. I tell you what.
H is proud of those men. The Filipinos
were armed like white men and they had
the deviltry of Filipinos, and it's a deadly
combination. Captain Lucio Nocom,' - a
dangerous leader, . had brought them U-
Casiguran. It was 10:30 at night and the
fighting was under difficulties.
I'll tell you what those men of H did
They saw twenty Filipinos advancing
when they were just five strong, counting â¢
the civilian, and. they' decided to hold that
house and stick it out against them. It
was twenty to five, that means four to
one, and they never. thought twice about
It, but went ahead to fight.
These four fellows were Corporal Elmer
Llntz and the three privates. John H.
Breckinridge. George A. Mason and Jame.-=
Blee Jr. Freeman Hoy, a civilian, was
v.'ith them. They were occupying an
empty house at Casiguran. It was an
ordinary Filipino house of the better kind,
pretty well built as they go. I tell you
the ones we had to live in at Baler
weren't well built, though. They were
the shacks of the negretos, and they Hvf
in any old thing, as I said.
So were all those wretched Tagalogs.
with their good rifles. They keep at it
when they once start in to light. But
there was one time when twenty of them
could'nt hold out against four of our
Company H men, and they got good and
plenty of what they needed before our fel â¢
lows v.-ere through with them.
He didn't do a thing but walk over t<>

u LIEKDY of the Twenty-second
Infantry of the glorious army
of Ur.cle Sam has been creating a stir.
The beginning of the stir was his
3eported demand for a brigadier-gen-
eralchip as a reward for the capture
of Aguinaido. The end of it is his
resignation from the nrmy.
For fourteen months he was sta-
tioned at Baler, which is an isolated
point on the eastern coast of Luzou.
It is the most remote point on the
iisland. During bis stay at this point
ho had an engagement with some of
Aguinaldo's nen wHch lad to the-
giving up of a letter from Aguinaido
This in turn led to the great general's
capture, and Detchemendy lays claim
to the glory cf the capture. N
The captain has been in Uncle SanVs^
array for more than a score of years.
During that time he has served at
Aicatraz and Angel Island, has been
stationed at San Francisco, and net
seen nctivc service in Cuba and th
Philippines. He is'a'fighter and r

making it his headquarters. You see. It
had been thought that he was killed at

But It seems that he had escaped all

taken them from their hiding places In

they could be mighty comfortable, as
they supposed. But we made it a little

14
EXPERIENCES AT BALER. The elbow sleeve, though It is pretty
for dinner and evening, is, a matter of dis
pute for street wear. For this time. of
year there Is no argument,, but even in
August there are those who do. not fancy
it. At the same time it must be men
tioned that there are many who do admire
it and who like to wear it.
. Last, summer on Fifth avenue and, on
Broadway, in New York," In Bond -street,'
London, and on the Rue de la Paix, Paris,
one- saw in the mlddle/'of the day, walk
ing and shopping; hundreds of elegantly
gowned, women ..wearing, sleeves that did
not come below the elbow, without gloves
and carrying, parasols. They sauntered
through the crowded., thoroughfares as
unconcernedly as though they were ; not
doing that which would, a few years ago,
have been thought decidedly immodest.
\ For.ISaster.the elbow, sleeve will not be
worn : for the street without the ! under-
sleeve. Even the long glove will not sup
ply the; place of the sleeve and "to the
wrist"';. will be the cry for several months
,to come. Â¦â¢ ' .'-Â¦ â¢; ? '-. . Â¦ ' â¢ v ' Â¦ ' Â¦ -
Put a word must be said in. passing for
the- pretty -shirt waists that are sold with

here "is a shirt waist that was completed
no longer ago than yesterday arid sent
home for a'very quiet Sunday afternoon
Lenten recital. . - Â¦
The modiste who niade it, and who
charged well for her work, began with a
heavy, handsome shirt waist of heliotrope
moire. It whs made with< tucks turning
toward the . shoulder, at each side of the
front, away, from the buttons 1 and out In
a manner,:, tp 'broaden t the shoulders.
Though a. high-priced waist, from one of
the most expensive shops, it was untrim
med except with the 'tucks, which were
released at the bust line, leaving the
lower' part plain.
The -evolution of this shirt waist she
shall tellin her ownwords:
. showy a trimming as can be applied to a
waist. Upon any skirt it is decidedly dis
tinguished.
A spring trimming that is even cheaper
is the band of panne silk or velvet and it
is really difficult to" distinguish between
these, two materials at a short distance.
s Bands are applied to lace In such a way
"that the-lacc* projects at each side to form
an. edge. This very handsome trimming

skirt, or it} can bo .used to form a yoke
upon the hlps.jor it can make a waist
yoke or it can be crossed upon the bust
with the ends pointing toward the shoul
der seams;
Stitched bands are just as fashionable
as they were, but at . this season, when
new /styles 'ire blossoming forth, the
stitched band is overshadowed by the ele
Â»gunce and popularity of the lace and vel
vet trimmings/
A* High-Toned Waist.
The Short Sleeve.
Regarding the short sleeve of summer,
about which so many correspondents
have asked, it. is perfectly safe to predict
that the short sleeve will be. seen later,
but not for many'.months to come. .
The sleeves of the shirt waist, being
long and pretty, afford undersleeves for
the Eton and supply the length desired.
Miss Daisy Leiter wore a chiffon one
dotted with black velvet dots, like veiling,
ever a tan-colored . silk foundation,' , the
whole pulled down baggily around the
waist, under a very trim tan, cloth Eton
buttoned in the back. ..' '..'.. ..
Having made over your waist this far,
take it and cut it off above the waist,
halfway between the belt and the arm
holes, to make of it a little modernized
Eton, buttoned in the back, the very
newest thing in dressmaking.
With this you will want to wear a very
handsome little needl.ework shirtwaist, or
a silk waist, or a chiffon affair. . Let tho
shirt waist be governed by your taste and
the general style of the gown..

âthe line that gives the waist a mature

All of these thin goods require fine
linings, but it has come to such a state
of perfection in dress that^all linings are
fine and it costs no more, or vecy little
mure, to get a pretty lining with a silk
or a satin finish than a coarse one In gray
or brown.
All daintily constructed women love nice
linings and the spring lining fabrics cater
to this taste very thoroughly. There are
flowered lining silk?, only partly silk, that
lire beautiful and strong.
The Easter church dress has many
quaint features. It has come to a pass
when one cannot make up one's material
and rest content. There is no such thins
as a restful certainty in. styles and you
must be always on the lookout, or you
will get left in the matters that mark
you as a woman of taste. The self-stock,
or a stock of the same goods, Is one* of
the noticeable things.
The very newest note, one just sounded
from the very fashionable dressmaking
The Lining Question.
The Easter church gown may with all
.propriety this year be a silk dress. There
was once a time when the only approved
church gown was a silk, black, brown,
peacock blue or olive, and to have a silK
dress for church was a necessity with the
well-meaning woman. Then for a time
silk went out,- except for dress occasions,
and cloth reigned. It came back again,
gradually at first, but now it enjoys full
favor. *
The mercerized materials paved the way
for silk. . For the past two seasons you
have scarcely been able to distinguish
mercerization from the actual product of
the silk worm, and the imitation silk
gown and the mercerized separate waist
were seen everywhere.
But now it is all silk, the moire, the
taffeta, the gros grain, the corded and
the ottoman, nearly all revivals; and
there are also the novelty silks, the
pacne. the miroir, the changeables called
by many fancy names, and the lovely lib
erty finishes.
Xot a few of these have durability to
recommend them and the matter of wear
seems to be largely also of price. By pay
ing a little more you get a silk that will
wear a little longer. The flowered silks,
the empires and the Louisines well de
serve their place at the head of the list.
But, ronning a close rivalry to theoo
silks and satins, there come the diaphan
ous goods. These ' are not necessarily
nets and chiffons and the materials
which we know as the X-ray goods, but
they are the new veilings that are as

in color, and the fine canvas cloths and
the open mesh madras.
There are also the thin cloths which
are called panne cloths, and there is a
new, soft cloth with a velvet. finish that
looks precisely like velvet, yet is as thin
as veiling itself. Cashmere comes this

fully and studiously she can walk the
aisles of the stores and look, and with
what deliberation can she make her selec

On each side of her she will see brocad

cloths with roses in them." cottons with

wreaths upon their face, and, more than
all, the splendid assortment of Louisine
silks. ' " '
Accustomed as she is to the plain silks
and the smooth-faced woman's cloths and
cashmeres, the flowered and brocaded
goods will dismay her. But If she will
study them she will see how they can
be turned to her benefit rather than to
her undoing.
The pattern goods will also tempt her,
but these come in more high priced ma

there is this about a pattern dressâ and
always thisâ that it needs no other trim

{" 1 Miss Frances Willard once re
<A^ > / marked that fresh clothing y had
to her a moral tone that brought
renewal of grace, spirit and religion- If
dear Miss Willard felt the beneficent ef

A certain woman reformer who has not
yet passed into history declares that she
feels more courage to face an audience
when she wears a gown that Is all that
It should beâ more confident of success. .
To wear a gown that is all that it
should be Is the right of every woman at
Eastertide. It Is the custom of her lani
to blossom out in a new gewn during the
Eastern moon and both persistently and
gladly should she claim it.
The Easter church gown is a distinct
factor in the worship of the American
woman, and, while she Js giving thanks
for good things, an added note will sure
ly be given her praise If, to her mur
mured words of gratitude, she can offer
one for the material benefits of good
How to buy it, how to cut it
out, how to niake it, what to
line it -with and how to wear
it â Smart little dssigns for the
woman who likes to rejoice at
Eastertide in a gown as new
as the budding leaves upon the
trees â Queen Alexandra's best
dress and the frocks in which
titled American wome^. are
doing their coronation shop
ping â Easter sleeves and East
er skirts.
This much Is certain, thit it Is gown
time. Whatever you buy, buy something,
for the Eastertide is the tido of new
clothes; and, unhappily, unwise the one
who does not blossom out just a little
with the trees. â¢ ,- "
Crepe de sole, crepe de chine and crepe
do Paris are three of the materials that
lend themselves nicely to the dotting pro
cess and that make up effectively into
soft shirt fronts or into whole shirt waists
to be j worn under the cloth Jacket, so
as to peep out in the front, or around
the bottom of the jacket.iJSH
It is the most up-to-date, thing In the "
world to match the spots on tha veil to
the gown, but few there be with the in
dustry to do so, for one must apply these
dots by hand.
As to the dotted veil it. is now raised
to a pinnacle of perfection which might be
called, an art.' Its dots are numerous and
large, but they are located upon a very
thin mesh, and they are placed at Inter
vals, which render it possible to avoid
the placing of a spot upon the tip of th*
nose, or on the pupil of either eye.
Crescents In white velvet are very fash
ionable upon the * very thin mesh veils,
and so are hollow circles in black velvet
ani in tan velvet and in royal blue.
.The under sleeves are treated In th*'*
same dotted way and the dot craze has
penetrated the smart little cutaway coat
which is part of the suit, whose lapels
and deep sailor collars are well speckled
with medium sized black velvet dots. In
the figured goods one sees beautiful black
velvet dots on a taffeta ground.
Queen Alexandra has a new gown made
of gray broadcloth. The graduated flounco
is trimmed around the bottom, with data
the size of dollars, and dots just as largo
outline the yoke, which is lace covered.
The lace looks something like the Irish
crochet lace, but it has applications of
small black. dots upon It
The Queen's Trimmings.
Dots the size of quarters are set above
flounces, and dots as big ' as dimes art
arranged in pyramid form around the
skirt, the point of the pyramid extending
up "well toward the belt. Yokes are out
lined with dots, while the same decora
tions in a smaller size make the yoke it
self, and dot trimmings are used upon the
baggy lower parts of the sleeves.
Alt these dots grew from the French
knot, which is a tiny black silk dot.
made by cunning workmanship, until now
the dot. in its full grown size is as big as
a silver dollar. . Â¦
Edged with lace is this dot, or applied
with button hole stitching. Or it is bor
dered with a circle of velvet of a different
color, the circle being made by applying
one dot over the other, a black velvet one
upon a larger one of tan; or a white vel
vet dot upon a larger one of black, and
the whole set upon a little circular pat
tern of lace.
The black" dot is playing its part, and
an important one in the trimming for the
yea,r. In London, where they are all shop
ping for the, coronation, the black dotted
gown is the rule. It is not the polka dot,
but the dot of commerce, the black vel
vet dot, the brown velvet dot and tha
one of blue and tan.
The velvet is bordered with a very
deep button hole stitching" in gray silk.
Over the gray silk there is a button hole
stitching in white silk, the two stitchings
making a trimming of their own. Velvet
and button hole stitching and velvet and
cat stitching are fashionable companions.
Bands and Dots.
The trimming of this flounce is confined
to a' three-inch heading of gray velvet,
for the skirt is gray, put on in broken
lengths, with the velvet crossed at each
of the broken ends. Above this there are
lozenges of velvet as big around as - sil
ver dollars. Â¦
Under this* flounce there is a plaiting
of taffeta exactly the length of the out
side skirt, and under this there is a drop
skirt fa'line; from the belt.
Around the foot of this handsome street
suit, for a street suit it is, there Is a
deep flojunce that is of graduated width.
Its front is ten inches deep; its back full
eighteen.
This flounce is tucked in little clusters
of three at the head, bu* the tucks es
cape to help, make the foot flare, which
must be as pronounced as possible.
The back has a long sweep that, while
It gives height, al3o gives the wearer no
end of trouble. It is so long that not for
an instant can it be allowed to sweep a
public place of meeting, such as church
or theater, much less the street.
An Easter church suit shows a skirt
that is actually of reception length. It
lies upon the floor in front to a length
of certainly three inches.
If she prefers she can have the box
plait in evidence and wear it boldly at
her back to give her a little more grace
and not to define her figure so sharply.
It is all a matter of taste with her, for
both styles are correct. The plait is
usually stitched flat nearly a foot down
the back.
But in working on the gown around
thei foot of the skirt there comes an op
portunity for study.
Shirts show the same perplexing uncer
tainty that characterizes waists and par
ticularly the sleeves thereof. â¢ Fortu
nately for the woman who is making up
a skirt which is to wear her all the spring
âand do duty again next fall as a sec
ond bestâ all the variety seems to be
found around the- foot of the skirt and
she can pin her faith to the plain tight
fitting top with the same inverted box
plait at the back.
Â¦â¢ m The Skirt Question.
""Was it a great deal of work? No. to
the contrary, It was very quickly and
easily done, for the only workmanship
required was in the application of the
lace strips, a thing any half-skilled ap
prentice could do, and the careful selec
tion of the flowers and the making of the
little French knots.
"The result was remarkably good and
a waist was produced that was every whit
as elegant as many an imported creation
that is sold for $75. whereas the cost was
a very small fraction of that sum. But
remember"that the first step was <he buy
ing of a handsome shirt waist."
'.'The waist now presented the appear
ance of being a heliotrope moire tucked
across the yoke. Below the yoke it was
very French in design, consisting of al
ternate bands of silk and lace; three
inches wide."
"As a final touch I embroidered stems
upon the flowers *<n green and sprinkled
black French knot3 in black silk through
the lace strips.
Story of a Waist:
"The third step in the treatment was
the cutting' away of. the silk underneath
the lace . strips.
"Taking the waist." said she. "I ap
plied bands of filet lace to it from thÂ»
point where the tucks terminated to tha
belt. It took lace three inches wide and
I left a three-inch apace .between the
bands of lace. The application of laco
was put on with a button-hole stitch
around the border of the lace to mako
it perfectly firm.
"My second step was the sewing on of
small purple velvet pansies to the lace,
one pansy set below the other, three
Inches apart. All the strips of lace were
appliqued with these little pansy flowers.'
Itely finished and supplied with frills and
laces that fall nearly to the wrist. They
are for the most part cut in pagoda and
bell shapes, so that the arm is displayed
-from the elbow down.
Â¦ m \The trimming for the Easter gown
opens up a field for perplexing thought.
A great variety offers itself, all in pretty
styles, though not all novel by any means.
The appliqued flowers of lace suggest
themselves first because they are dressy
and not difficult to obtain or to put on.
Then comes the option of embroidery, but
this is not within reach of all.
There are handsome trimmings, In the
shape of laces, run . with velvet ribbons
ho wider than a 'cord, the lace wide and
heavy. These are beautiful, but they are
somewhat -expensive and the Easter
church gown may be now under way and
built upon line's that will not permit the
adding of a trimming whose price is dol
lars a yard, instead of half dollars. ;
. As a compromise, between the very
cheap trimmings and the very expensive
ones, there is the French velvet decora
tion, than which nothing prettier has been
found. It consists of bands of .black vel
r vet ribbon fastened together with an open
stitch. The bands may be any width; an
Â¦ effective . trimming is two inches wide.
..Three bands joined with 'an open stitch
and twisted to form a design make as
Over the front, which has been stitched
up, set a few tucks, or press the seam
very flat so that it does riot look like a
seam. The object is to avoid the straight
If you are making an old gown, sew it
up in the front and open it down the
back. It may not be a popular style with
you or your family, for the difficulties at
tending this kind of dress are obvious to
every woman who does, not keep a maid.
But it will give you a youthful air and
that is what you must have. It will also
give you a fashionable this-season look.
The Made-Over Gown
When you have applied this wide band
of %-elvet let there be a frill of lace put

of the spring laces, not a fine <=oft lace,
but an assertive lace with decided p-*t-'

sleeves will be the proper thing. 'Go.
then, if you are making a cloth gown and
cut it off at the elbows. Save a little of
the material, if you will, for- another pair
of sleever, lest the styles change before
the gown is worn around the hem, but
just now you must be in the mode.

like a saflfile with a hump at each end

"The second officer called me at 6:20

yesterday, "and reported two patches of
discolored water on the port bow. These
patches looked to be about 100 feet square.

as it did not break over the shoal I

breaking I would have investigated more
thoroughly, but as there was no break

SEAS ROLL OVER SHOAL.
Captain Lawless says he has often spo
ken with De Graves about the island and
has corroborated De Graves' .story as
far as dates are concerned. A man
named Peacock In Honolulu has shown
his faith In De Graves' story by fitting
out two expeditions to search for tha
missing land. Other expeditions have
gone out, and De Graves still lives in
the hope of some day sharing the wealth

This is not borne out by tho press ad

the officials. '
WASHINGTON, March 22.â The situa
tion In Southern China is attracting the
anxiety of the State Department officials,
who are in no mood to become again in
volved in that quarter of the world. The
last news from the eeat of , trouble was
contained In a cablegram received here
from United States Consul -> Me Wade, at
Canton, dated March 18, Â«aying: "Vice
roy reports rebellion in Kwangsl almost
crushed." '.
HONGKONG, March 22.â The' rebels
have captured the prefectural town of
Kamchou, in'the province of Kwangtung,
and have seized " the arsenal and gran
aries. The mandarins of the garrison fled
and appealed to Canton for reinforce
ments. The Viceroy of ! Canton replied
that it was impossible to further deplete
the Canton garrison and urged that Gen
eral Mato make the utmost efforts to put
down the rebellion.
In view of this positive announcement
Germany will undoubtedly cloak her de
signs in Shantung by continuing her pol
icy of acquiring privileges and attempt
ing to prevent- other countries from ob
taining a foothold in the province. yV
REBELS STILL ACTIVE.
A high- authority stated to-day that the
policy of , the United States' with respect
to'Shantung is identical with that in re
gard to Manchuria." In his note to Russia
arid China regarding Manchuria, a copy
of which was handed a few : wa*>ks ago
to Germany, Secretary Hay declared that
"an agreement. whereby China" gives any
corporation or company exclusive .right
or privilege of ' opening mines, . establish
ing railroads or in any other way Indus
trially developing Manchuria can but be
viewed with the gravest concern by the
.Government of the United States."

it was apparently free from any design
of exclusive exploitation, but the author

LETTER TO WASHBTJRN.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON, March 22.-There is
a growing disinclination among: members
of the military committees in both houses
of Congress to report any of the impor
tant bills now before, them, largely on ac
count of the attitude of General Miles
and his quarrel with the department. The
most far-reaching of the measures look
ing to the reorganization of the army are
what Is known as the general staff bill,
which General Miles so severely criticized
before the Senate committee, and the
militia, bill, which includes the project to
add to the army some 300,000 more soldiers
in time of need. The latter is not. only
backed strongly by the War Department,
but has been agreed to by the adjutant
generals of the various States. It is re
garded as a very important measure and
one that was quite likely to pass had not
the recent complications arisen. It is
now said by leading military authorities
in Congress that this will be included in
the general hold-up until more harmony
exists in the department.
NOT TO BE REPORTED.
, .Prominent members of the Senate Com
mittee on military affairs said to-day that"/
unless Secretary Root continued to press (
the staff bill it j would probably not j txs
reported this session. It was further said
that even if it were pressed *it would find
so much serious opposition that- If it,
passed at all it would be only after a
severe contest and considerable criticism. .
Members of the committee who hold this
view '.have been giving consideration to
the- testimony: presented in behalf of the
b^^jSÂ«cretary Root, and say that it is
not' satisfactory. This, in addition to tha
severe criticism made by General Miles.
and the consequent lack of harmony be
tween the head of the War Department
and. the ' lieutenant general, has had' the
effect of postponing for the present fur
ther-serious consideration. . : .--- r J

One of the most amusing sequels of Dil
lon's forcible retorts ,. occurred in the
grand committee-room of tho House of
Commons, where a deputation of women
graduates was presenting a petition ask
ing to be given the power to vote at ttie
election for members of Parliament. Miss
Beatrice Harraden. the novelist, who was
one of the delegates, warmly supported
the petition, claiming thai it was unfair
that women should have to pay the in
come.tax and yet not be allowed.'to vote
at Parliamentary elections. The members
of. Parliament who w^re listening were
hurriedly called to take part in the divis
ion on Dillon's suspension. -. i â¢
- The object . of this abuse has created
another sensation, not, as usual, by hit
ing invective, but by- his clothes. Tne
Tailor and Cutter, which paper was ac
customed to belaud the Colonial Secre
tary as the very pink of fashion, now
says:
"We. are sorry to note that Mr. Cham
berlain is developing quite a stoop,, and
fear that he is losing some of his old-time
smartness. It is true that his monocle
is still in Its old place, but we miss the
familiar orchid, and, as we have examined
his garments, we could not but feel that
conservatism was sadly apparent.' for
there was much in them that was not up
to-da^e." . . \ '
Chamberlain's coat lapels, says the
Tailor and Cutter, are plain, â¢ heavy and
disfigured by a long, gaping breast pocket,
like some ugly wound, calling for assist
ance. The washing vest of Chamberlain,
the paper also says, was quite out of har
mony with his coat, while hia trousers
were wide and â¢ unshapely.
The Westminster Gazette humorously
comments on the fact that a weak spot
has. at last been found in Chamberlain's
armor, adding:
"Remembering the weird and wonderful
clothing with which the doorkeepers of
the House of Lords were startled in'1893,
when the home rule bill gathered the
noble clans together, we can only come to
the conclusion that Mr.. Chamberlain is
beginning to qualify for a seat in tho

minor reforms may be desirable, but

any." .Â¦ Â¦ . â¢.â¢..'â¢.,.. â¢â¢ .'.

confectionery store. It was afterward
learned that the note contained a state

off the gas. â¢ Atythat time Downey was -in
bed, sleeping quietly. At 5 o'clock In the

that Downey had not vacated it. ' Failing
to effect an entrance, the key being in

the face of the returns Rhea. had 158

George Alfred Lamb of counsel. for Pe
ter Power made the following statement
In several of -the newspapers of this morn
ing have appeared Items suggesting that the
counsel representing Peter Power in his suit
against the Northern Pacific Railway Com
pany have found or anticipated some difficulty
In securing the attendance as a witness of
either J. P. Morgan or some member of his
firm.
Any such suggestion, whether or not so in
tended, is in defiance of the facts and with
out Justification whatever. Mr. Perkins of
the firm has already appeared and been ex
amined. Mr. Steele of the firm was ready to
appear yesterday at the time appointed, but his
examination was postponed, not at his request,
but at the request of Judge Lancaster, for the
plaintiff. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Morgan re
turned to the city, from which he had been
absent during the pendency of these proceed
ings, of which he knew nothing until on Thuce-
Uay at Washington. Immediately upon learn
ing of the desire for his examination he in
ntructed me to advise Mr. Power's "Counsel that
he would attend at a&y time without subpena.
At once I so advised the counsel, who answered
that this would -be entirely satisfactory, . and
accordingly we arranged for Mr. Morgan's vol
untary appearance next week.
-Apparently because of the inability of the
counsel to reach his process servers, for which
miscarriage he has written to me expressing
regret, Mr. Morgan was served last evening
with a subpena by a messenger who obtained
admission . to his. residence upon the under
standing of Mr. 'Morgan that the messenger
had come from my office, a statement for
which Mr. Power's counsel, disclaims any re
sponsibility and expresses regret if any such
statement was made.
It may " be a matter of news, but it hardly
can be a matter of general satisfaction, that
admission to the private house of any. gentle
man should be obtained, : as stated in this
morning's papers, . by rose, which, of course,
means by deception. In any case such a pro
ceeding would be one for which reputable coun
sel naturally would desire to disclaim responsi
bility. In this case any such proceeding was
unnecessary.

Something like twenty-six crisp new patterns in Bodv

The brands are: The "Lowell, ' the "Bigelow- Lowell." the
"Whittall" and the "Whittall- Victoria." If you know carpet
qualities, no more than the mere mention of these names is
1 necessary so far as the value is concerned.
| We spoke of ''differentness" above. Really, that is the fea-
ture of the entire line â there isn't a common pattern in the lot.
One of the first pieces that will attract your attention is a pecu-
liar sort of a checker-board effect that looks verv much like
one of the old-fashioned "gingham" dress patterns. Another
eye-catcher is an intensely odd Oriental design â palm leaves
against a deep-blt^e ground. A rarely beautiful pattern is one
with black lace work on a rich red ground, quite a fantastic
border to match. These are just hints of the surprises that this
new line holds in store for you. Come and see them.

"Although a woman In my position can receive plenty of prescriptions from
" physicians without cost. It was upon the advice of a wdll-known West End Doc-

might not like It. But all the same, I took it when I was run down from eight
work in the sick room. I was thin and yellow and tired even when I rose from my

"Therein lies the real motive for these
eight roads which are. already enjoined
insisting on the rest being Included. They
based their action on a plea for justice,
saying it was not fair to pick out eight
roads and discriminate against them
when all the rest were doing similar busi
ness. That sounds well, but I think they
were just wise enough to see that all
the lines combined would make a stronger
fight than eight only, so they took ad
vantage of this discrimination to try to
get the rest included. It would seem they
have succeeded."

William F. McAllister Is a member of
the Salvation Army of this city and is
stationed at the barracks, at the corner
of Sacramento and Kearny. streets. He, is
not a captain but an enthusiastic private.
When seen last night he acknowledged
having written the letter to Sheriff Gil
strap, and said that he was moved to do
bo by his conversion to Christianity. He
confesses having committed burglaries,
not only in Macon County, Mo., but also
in Atlantic, Iowa, and several other
places. To prove the sincerity of his re
pentance he intends to confess to all his
crimes and stand punishment if necessary.
The standard of the Salvation
Army Is not the only flag that
McAllister has followed. During â¢ the
Spanish- American war \ he served
both in Cuba and the Philippines.
He was a sergeant in Company K, Thirti
eth Volunteer Infantry. He carries a let
ter of recommendation from Captain F.
W. Latimer of Company K, praising in
the highest terms his bravery while serv
ing Uncle Sam. He also served under
Maximo Gomez, when that general was
flKhtlng for the freedom of Cuba. <*
The burglary, about which he wrote to
Sheriff Gilstrapj was committed four
years ago, whilÂ«f the one at Atlantic,
Iowa, occurred In 1890. McAllister was
converted last December, but was not
sworn In as a member of the Army until

James Wllcox. was to-night found guUty
of- the murder of Nellie Cropsey. The
jury, after having been out thirty hours,
brought in a verdict of guilty In the first
degree. The prisoner heard the verdict
without apparent emotion. When the
\ erdlct had been, read. Judge Jones- said :
" "It" Is" sadder for me than you, Mr.< Wll
cox. The jury found the facts. I gave
the law. You have had a fair trial. Fart
of the public were afraid to give it to
you. I am informed , that the movement
in the courthouse here Friday when a
crowd marched out was prearranged. I
hope such was not the case. It it is
true and the offenders were brought be
fore me, I would send every man, woman
and child to jail for contempt.
"If the move was tor a purpose it waa
a disgrace to the fair namo of tne coun
try. I hope it did not influence you, gen
tlemen, in the least. The judgment of the
court is that the prisoner be removed to
jail and be hanged by the neck until dead
on Aoril 25." .
Counsel for the defense will appeal to
the Supreme Court.

that he had committed a burglary In Ma

come to.Macon at his own expense, plead
guilty and take his penitentiary sentence

him. The penitent burglar's letter, | after
reciting the facts'' of the burglary, says:
"Now for the crime I committed there.
I am ready to . answer - to the j law. Of

into my life and wrought a mighty change

parts of the East. It has been a matter of regret that the counties of Northern California could
not have attracted thousands of the visitors, so as to relieve the strain upon the south, and hold
the visitors in the State after they left that section. Along with the tourists, who are but birds of
passage, there come many who are looking for good- investmentjÂ»;,for ; capital and good places in
which to establish homes. California has an ample variety, of attractions to please almost any taste
that may exist among these pleasure-seekers or home-seekers. If one county do not suit* them,
another county may. We Ought to be able to induce ;the visitors to 'see something of every por
tion of the State before they return East. To that end the movement for the upbuilding of Cali
fornia is working, and it is gratitying to note that' all conditions of the time are in harmony with
the movement New energies. and new harmonies are blossoming in timeiwith the orchards; bud
ding in harmony with^ the vineyards and the fields, and the harvest; promises to be abundant.
WORK for the upbuilding of Northern California has begun at a most propitious time.
Something of the budding hopefulness of the spring seems to be in it all. From the
first the movement has found a sympathetic response .from all 1 classes of people. The
commercial associations of San Francisco have readily joined with it;the State Board
of Trade has accepted the task of directing and promoting it; county after county has manifested
an intention to share in the work as well as a desire to profit by it; and Southern California, look
ing upon it not with jealousy, or ungenerous rivalry, but as a movement for the welfare of all
California, has cordially commended'it.
The usual festivals of the spring- will add ;. a new stimulus to the enthusiasm that is so
widespread and so deeply felt. When the street fairs of the interior. cities and the flower festivals of
the counties draw the people together in large crowds, there will be felt a new inspiration toward
harmonious work for the general good. In the abundant evidences that will be everywhere dis
played of the rich 'resources of the State 4 and of the profitable industries of the people, even the
most skeptical will perceive convincing proofs that" to attain a higher prosperity for all sections of
California nothing more is needed than a co-operative exercise of energy on the part of Califor
nians; and the sanguine spirit thus engendered will be helpful in prompting "those who have been
hitherto indifferent to unite with 'their neighbors and urge on the. movement which the State
Board of Trade has undertaken. " M-

work," Mr. Bryant confessed. "I want
money, more money most money, and
then I can see about the other things.
Only the rich man Is perfectly free to ex

as possible, so far as my share of It goes,
with the idea of building a play that will

or seems to want from my experience of it
at the Alcazar. Curiously, too, plays writ

sometimes succeed."
Mrs. Coleman says that her Idea In the
play was simply to tell a pretty story,
though she gracefully owns that the pe
cuniary reward, in case of success, that
would make it reasonable for her to con
tinue her work, would come not ungrate
"Well," Mr. Bryant rejoins, "If It Is not

"Oh, it makes me shiver to think about

AUTHORS OF THE NEW PLAY
"WHEN HEARTS WERE
YOUNG."
La Scala Itself, perhaps the most famous
of all homes of opera, is run at a yearly
loss of 250,000 francs, which is borne by
some Maecenas of Milan for the service
of the adored art, for -onger or shorter
periods, according to his inclination or
capacity. The present Maecenas has been
In office for five years. Besides this pri
vate munificence La Scala has a yearly
subsidy of 250.000 francs from the munici
pality, and is also free of rent for thu
opera season. It would seem from these
facts as If La Scala were but Indifferently
well patronized, but It is only rarely that
one of its 3S00 seats can be obtained with
out booking a long time ahead, notwith
standing the stiff prices, that range from
5 to 30 francs. The explanation fles In the
splendid finish and costliness of the pro

The distinguished barrel organists that
represent Italian art on our streets are no
more to be found In Italy than, the aniline
grotesques that the contemptuous Jap
exports here are to be found adorning
the houses of Japan. Music is in the
air. The child is born singing, and the
country takes to it as naturally as duck
dom to swimming. The advent of a new
opera is discussed to the full as eagerly
asâ sayâ the democratic trend of King
Emmanuel's recent speeches, and the
butcher, the baker and candlestick maker
are all competent to take part in the dis
cussion'. (Which is all very familiar, but
comes with new breeziness from Mr.
Leahy's enhtusiastic lips.)
BETWEEN intervals of the very
good little production of "The
Serenade" that the Tivoli Is now
offering I had a chat with our
local Impresario. W. H. Leahy, the
other evening, about bis recent visit to
Italy in search of talent for the coming

IF this play fails it is because it is bad,
irredeemably bad." Thus Charles
Francis Bryant, stage manager of the
Alcazar, on the new play that he has
written In collaboration with Mrs.
Lottie Day Coleman. that will be produced
at the Alcazar" in the near future.
I like to hear, people who do things talk
of their work, whether it be the making
of plays or pies'; and therefore when Mrs.
Coleman was good enough tolnvite me to
hear something about the new play I was
pleased to go to her flower-filled, pleasant
room to hear the story. Mr. Bryant was
also there, and his aforementioned remark
was in response to a guess of mine at the
chances of success for any play.
'Â¦ Meditatively thumping one of Mrs. Cole
man's cushlous â Mr. Bryant had the j
lounge â the manager-playwright went on:
"Our playâ 'When "Hearts" Were Young,"
we have called Itâ has everything in the
way of production tn its favor. It is tit
ted to the capacities* of the Alcazar com
pany and. as far as possible to the
ascertained requirements of the Alcazar
audiences. It will be carefully and even
sumptuously staged, is being thoroughly
rehearsed and if it falls it is because it
is inherently bad."
"But you think?â 7-"
"Of course we think there Is something
In it, or we should not give it," said Mr.
Bryant. "But we are not the public, and
you cannot bank on the public. There is
absolutely no method of prophesying
which way it will take anything. I have
seenâ well, everything but the expected,
happen, and it takes only the smallest
touch . to turn the tide. ,A laugh in the
wrong place, and pouf! your whole scene
is spoiled. There Is one thing In 'When
Hearts Were -Young,' or rather not in
it. The young gentlemen of the gallery,
to whom the hero's chaste salute upon
the lovely heroine's lips is the usual sig
nal for a chorus. of deadly smacks that
simply ruins the scene, are going to get
left this time. The hero and heroine
never quite reach that point, though the
play ends happily. Kisses are always dan
gerous, by Jove!" Mr. Bryant thoughtfully
concluded.
"Then the" play will not offend in the
matter of long speeches. Everything that
can be told in action is told that way. and
there is plenty of It. Then there are no
asides, soliloquies, or other artificial
methods of relating the story. It has been
understood, by the way, that 'When
Hearts Are Young* is a rural drama, but
It is not. But I have done only the car
penter work; ask. Mrs. Coleman about the
Story." . .
Mrs. Coleman. deprecating Mr. Bryant's
modesty, explained that the play is found
ed upon New England life, the characters
being New England types, with the local
color confined to rural scenes, but not to
the haunt of the stage hayseed and un
earthly country bumpkin that decorate
the usual rural drama, "It is taken from
life, and 'was studied out during a-one
time visit of mine to New England," Mrs.
Coleman says; "and there is no villain
worthy to be called 'sich,' no gospel Is
taught, no problem discussed, nor does
any one die in the play. There is what we
hope may prove a 'stro'ng heart Interest,*
as the press agents say, and what we
hope the critics will find a 'good comedy
relief.* We have taken four acts to teil
the story, and have pared away and
sheared things down until I do, not think
there is an unnecessary word in the whole |
four acts. I am particularly pleased with
the way' the actors at the Alcazar, have
expressed themselves concerning the play,
and am sure they will lend their best ef
fort to its, rendering. And 1 am delighted
beyond measure with the excellent way in
thing will be put on, Mr. Bry
ant and his staff having done wonders for
it., But Mr. Bryant has really done most
of the work."
The fair playwright comes from Sierra
County, by the way, and is well known as
a' popular magazine writer.
After courteously disclaiming any but a
carpenter's share in the work; Mr. Bry
ant smilingly. said: "But you have told
nothing of our endingâ we rather pride
ourselves on the ending. The eternal'ho
and she 1 are divided by seemingly Im
passable obstacles almost, until the de
scent of the final curtain, and the lady in
front of you Is going to be puzzled â¢ about
the precise moment . to put on her hat.
You should be gratef ul."
"If I'm still. there!" I comment. "But
as to the purpose of the play? Mrs. Cole
man has said that it preaches no gospel,
,and you, Mr. Bryant, have not said any
thing about having ; a mission to the
world, the uplifting of art, etc, etc Jus

An event of extraordinary musical in
terest will be the Helnrlch concerts for
next week, to be given by Max Heinrich
and Miss Julia Helnrlch at Sherman &
Clay Hall. The -artists â¢ are' well known
here, but they bring with them the first
important Richard Strauss composition
that has been programmed in San Fran
cisco, "Enoch Arden," a setting of the
Tennyson poem of the' "name. The poem
is â so to speak â intoned, and r Mr. Hein
rich recites it to Miss Heinrich's accom
paniment at the piano. Strauss himself
has called it "Melodrama for the Piano
forte," the programme explains, and fur
ther says "it- is In reality a series of de
scriptive tone pictures knit together by
the wording of Tennyson's poem." What
ever it is It is sure to be vastly interest
ing- and the opportunity of hearing some
thing by this modern magician, whose
genius is dividing the world of music Into
opposing camps as successfully as ever
Wagner did before him, is to be taken
with both ears. - .
Of the women Inez de Frate, with a
fame that reaches from La Scala to the
Imperial Theater, St. Petersburg-, from
Berlin to Vienna, has been secured for the
dramatic soprano roles. She has an im
posing repertoire, . including everything
from Leonora in "II Trovatore" to Isolde
in "Tristan." Adellna Tromben, a young
Venetian singer, is engaged as the lyric
soprano, and. has been heard to excep
tional advantage in the Mozart operas,
"Don Pasquale" and "II Nozze dl Figaro."
Mme. Fabbri, a contralto with a brilliant
record, will probably be engaged with Col

New operas to be given will include
"Andrea- Chenler," "La Tosca," "Fal-
Btaff," "Manbn" (Puccini), and. new to

and "Don Pasquale."

Of the familiar voices only three will be
heard this year, the fine basso of Dado,
who has made a big hit in "Linda di
Chamounlx," at La Scala; Agostini's cul
tivated tenor and Collamarini's colorful
contralto. Besides Agostinl there will; be
another lyric tenor. Gennario. a favorite
of three years at La Scala, and famed for;
a light, sweet, very flexible organ. Vener
andi, a youngster who touches high C
with ease and has a voice that in size
and quality is reminiscent of Tamagno's,
will be the dramatic tenor: De Padora,
before mentioned, with D'Albreo, will
cover the barytone roles, and Munez, with
Dado, the basso parts.

APPEAR IN A CONCERT SE
RIES IN SHERMAN-CLAY HALL.
To exclude. them and abandon the profits of commerce will solve one part of the problem.
Governor Taft has testified to one fact that was partly known before. The church owns nearly
all of the good agricultural lands in the islands, outside the Mahometan group. It is proposed
that we buy that land of the church for a sum variously estimated at from $40,000,000 to'
$ioo,ooo.coo. In the treaty of Paris we confirmed the church title to this property, and so cannot
imitate France and Mexico by confiscating it. Already the church authorities have put the matter
in the hands of that wisest of men, Leo XIII, who guards carefully every interest in his charge.
Now if Ave do not intend commercial exploitation of the islands we. don't want to buy the
church lands. We prefer the church there as the landlord of a dependent people. But which, policy
will we choose? If we had known these things in the green stick which we now know in the dry.,
it might' have been different: Even Governor Taft says in his testimony it would have been better
for the United States to have had nothing to do with. the Philippines. .But We have all to do with
them, and J. Pierpont Morgan offers to take all the Philippine bonds the island government will
issue, and at par without guarantee by the United States, and has told Judge Taft that he can get
his money out of the islands.
But it is the opinion of Senator Beveridge that the islands are a sumptuous vision of
wealth for our people. This wealth is affirmed by Governor Barrows to be agricultural and not
manufacturing. It must^be developed by human labor. " Taking it for granted that the natives will
not work and white men. cannot in that climate, there, is. ng ; reso.urce except Chinese labor, Avhich
stoutly resists the weakening influence of a r vertical; sun toils in all zones without a task
master. The commercial spirit says admit them. The missionary spirit says exclude them.
In this dilemma it becomes necessary^to decide the purpose for which we are in the Philip
pines. If we are there on a missionary errand, to change the religion; of the people and leach
their racial characteristics out of them, meantime holding theni at "attention" with a gun, we
should take Governor Taft's advice and abolish the only labor that produces a commercial surplus
by shutting out the Chinese.
It_ is the testimony of military and civil authorities that the" native Filipinos will not work ,
beyond the point of self-support. Like'all tropical people they are without commercial ambition.. I
and will not toil to produce a surplus, for commerce. It is the testimony of all Americans and' Â¦
Europeans in business in the islands that Chinese is the only profitable and productive labor .!
there. The dream that poor white men from the United States would, go there and by' agricul- I
ttiral industry make homes and leave -families is dissipated. The facts as to the impossibility of j
white labor in the tropics are becoming common knowledge. The War. Department, which has' â¢
been able to boast justly of the immunity of our. troops from^acute disease, has been compelled to
acknowledge the insidious invasion of their vitality by the climate, and to provide that two vears |
shall be the extent of their serviqe there, when they must be replaced by fresh men. The civil and |
military authorities agree that it will require 30,000 soldiers to' garrison the i. c /ahds and keep the \
people in restraint for twenty years to come. This means that that service will in that time absorb, j
360,000 soldiers, who must be transported there. and back.
\ In his testimony before the committee Mr. Barrows, who is our Governor .of the uncivil
ized tribes, said he did not expect to live to see the day when the Filipinos' would be capable of
self-government, "for the Filipino is not born who could control, to say nothing of governing j
justly, the. Philippine Islands." It seems like a contradiction when, answering a, question by Sena
tor.Hale, he said: "It would-be surprising if the Filipinos, who have been struggling for years for
independence and making sacrifices for it, should be able. to dismiss the thought from their minds
at once." It has been supposed to be the rule that capacity for self-government and the aspiration
for independence go together But dismissing that, it is evident that we must hold them dependent
until they dismiss from their minds the thought of independence That means an autocracy.. and' 1
autocracy depends on force, and force means the army. So, from this standpoint, we arc therefor !
principle and must exilu'de Chinese labor and give up commercial profit. This is a sacrifice and
all sacrifice is noble. Â¦. \\ ' ;"' - 'Â¦''':.
Turning to the alternative, we have the testimony of the same Governor Barrows that
"white men cannot do the manual and plantation labor of the islands." and that of the AmeVican
Chamber of Commerce that the natives will not labor beyond self-support. To this is added the \
declaration of both of our geneials of the army who have testifie 1. that the natives do not even \
knowhow to fight. One said that he never attacked them without regret, that it was "like killing- j
women and children; and there was in it neither glory nor honor.'"* The' other military witness I
admitted that a great many natives had been slaughtered because when attacked they would I
huddle together, could not defend themselves, and did not know enough to surrender. Plutarch -i
leaves us to conclude that Alexander, after marching to the Ganges, turned and left India because \
the people would not fight, and he concluded that a country was not' worth conquering whose â¢ !
people thought it not worth defending. Â¦ ".*Â¦" ;

One night in October, charges Mrs.
Bates, she had to summon a policeman
to help her to get Into the house because
Bates had nailed boards across all the
doors and windows. In November of last

carried away all her clothing and it took
her several weeks to find it.
Evangeline Cournier, who waa married
to L. F. Cournier at St. Paul, Minn., in
1880. is suing for divorce on the grounds
of cruelty and intemperance. Ehe charges
her husband with cursing and abusing
her, with threatening her life and with
drinking to such an extent that he negr-
Previous to this episode, the wife al
leg-es. her husband frequently beat and
choked her.
".Poor Bates Is dying:." vouchsafed one,
"A bucket of water wlll-jdo him- good,"
said another. And ptill Bates snored and
snored. "Get a doctor," was the advice
finally offered, and It worked wonders.
The nasal accompaniment ceased and
Bates arose to his feet and growled:
"I'm all right."
Bates was yanked forth without cere
mony, but the snores continued. A few
delicate kicks in the short ribs, and a
slap or eo from calloused hands failed to
Hup the snoring and Mrs. Bates and the
neighbors got ecared.
Pull Bates From Under Bed.
Bates' crowning act of cruelty, alleges
Mrs. Bates, was the fright he gave her one
night last December, when, while she lay
sound asleep, he crawled under her bed
and frightened her almost unto death by
the noises he made. She summoned the
neighbors, ehe alleges, and they proceeded
to investigate. Presumably there are sev
eral old maids who reside near Mrs.
Bates, for the first place searched was
the Epace under the bed. There, fiat on
his back, snoring as if the success of his
mission in life depended upon the noise
he made, was Bates.
A husband who crawls, stealthily, at
midnight, under his wife's bed and who
by his snores and other unseemly .noises
frightens his spouse so that she -calls in
her neighbors to investigate. Is the sort
of a husband John Bates of 274 Jessie
street is. according to his wife, Anna,
who filed a suit for divorce yesterday.
The complaint is a recital of some al
leged queer doings on the part of Bates.
The State Board of Trade Is anxious to

qualified and can give his time to the.
active and important duties of this pro
posed committee.
A. Sbarboro, president of. the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, has
also kindly agreed to serve as a member
of the committee until such time as he
can make a selection that will in all .wise
be satisfactory to his association.
Word having been received from Sena

be about a week yet, he has been asked
also to serve in the meantime. Only nine

He may be honest in his opinion, but he v may also be mistaken. In this enlightened age it is A SHAME FOR .S
ANY CASE OF PILES TO BE CUT. It is wholly unnecessary for a patient to be taken to a hospital, to, take "Â¦
chloroform and lie in a ward for weeks under the influence of opiates. These crude methods will soon be rele- Â¦
g^ted to oblivion by a newer and more humane treatment, which cures without endangering life, is less expensive, gj
and it is only in exceptional cases that it interferes with the daily. pursuits of the patient whileunder treatment. |jj
Over one thousand persons in this city and State have been cured during the past four years, and they now B
go forth to tell their glad story to their suffering friends. Some believe them and come at once for treatment, g
while others are full of prejudice, preferring to waste a few more years trying salves and ointments. Â§
The method of, treatment removes the pile tumors absolutely., It has never failed in a single case, but it is Â¦
no salve proposition. It cannot be sent, for it must be in the hands of a skilled physician, therefore patients must H
come to the office for treatment. . j|
Real sufferers may have the names of some of those cured, many of whom were cases of thirty arid forty H
years' standing. These persons may be consulted about the matter, in a quiet way. Some of the leading business Â¦
men of this coast are among the number. , S
No matter what you may have been told, or what your preconceived opinion may be, this thinsr will bear the Â§*
most thorough probing, and it is worth your while to investigate. If not interested yourself, for humanity's sake Â¦
save this address and give it to some suffering friend. For further particulars and references address JÂ»]

Pommer-Eilera Music Company possess
numerous special advantages In buying,

There Is a' great difference between the
cost of .making a really first-class de-
pendable piano and Its retail selling price,
and while the actual cost to build a high
class piano is probably as great as It was
a number of years ago, .the cost of mar-
keting or selling such Instruments can be
greatly reduced' by the Introduction of the
modern business ' methods Â¦ by which, the
great commercial Institutions In other
lines of trade have been so successfully

We live in an era of progress. Modern
facilities and Inventions to-day make pos-
sible' what but a few year* ago was con-
sidered unattainable. Old ideas, old meth-
ods, old . machinery and old prejudices are
being. daily swept aside in every, line of
human endeavor. I This applies . with
special emphasis to the "Western . piano

The. line of march took in the principal
streets and then extended out Santa Clara
to the carnival pavilion on the Alameda.'
This, was a fitting ending- for, the march
of the Woodmen,' as the trees of the Ala
meda and the forests of Agricultural
Park, in which is situated the hall, were
a suitable background for the camp in
which the Woodmen were to perform the
secret work of their ritual.
The big pavilion was handsomely deco
rated with flags and boughs. A musical
and literary entertainment preceded the
initiation, to which several thousand resi
dents of San Jose had been invited. W.

were answered by the yells df the Wood

Camps in Line of March.
The Oakland and Alameda delegations

The State law which provides that a
contract between owners and contractors
is void unless the price be in terms ; of
money only was adjudged invalid by the
Supreme Court yesterday. The court's de
cision is far-reaching in its effect, as it
makes the contract price the limit on" all
mechanics' liens.
F. W. Braun et al. are the owners of a
building known as the -Vickery block, in
Los Angeles. They contracted with Parton
& Tuttle for extended Interior Improve
ments, for which they were to pay $12,254
in Installments. The last, which was the
only one unpaid at the beginning of- the
suit, was $3064. One of the. terms or tne
contract was that Parton & Tuttle were
to have all the old material and to use
so much of it as would comply with tne
requirements. \' v Â¦'â¢Â¦', ,
The Stimson Mill Company furnished
considerable material to the contractors
and filed a claim of lien on the property.
The company was made the assignee of
other material men and laborers who also
had claims of lien. Suit for foreclosure
of these combined liens was brought
against the owners of the building. Ihe
value of all the claims was $9804 44.
The law provides that a contract price
must be in terms of money only. The
lower court held that f the agreement that
the contractors should be partly paid In
old materials was accordingly unlawful
and the contract void. Â¦ â¢
Holds Claims Were Just.
It was also decided that the materials
and labor of the lien claimants had been
furnished legally, although not literally,
at the instance of the owners of the
building. Consequently it was held that
their claims were just.
The Supreme Court declares that a law
which forbids people to make contracts
in which provision Is made for part pay
ments in something other than money is
unconstitutional. If the claims in the
case at bar should be allowed the owners
would have to pay more for their im
provements than they had contracted for.
It is held that the claimants can expect
redress only to the amount of the con
tract pricej What Is left of that is the
last installment, which amounts to $3064.
The owners, therefore, will have to pay
only this amount.
The court also decided yesterday that
the county of Alameda can not recover
$230 which it paid out to Henry Evers, a
former Coroner, on alleged fraudulent
claims. Evers handed in bills which were
allowed by the Board of Supervisors. At
a later date it is alleged that the. discov
ery was made that the bills were for ser
vices never performed. Suit to recover
the money was then instituted. The
court holds that it was the business of
the Board of Superviso.s to find out about
the validity of the claims before allowing
them. It is decided, accordingly, that
Evers can keep the money, even if he did
not handle as many unclaimed dead as he
said he did.
Transfer Is Denied.
' J. W. Hosselkus, administrator of the
estate of Mat Healey, deceased, failed in
his attempt to have his suit transferred
from Modoc County to some other local
ity. Healey was on the bond of John
Madden, the Modoc County Treasurer,
who in 1897 is alleged to have embezzled
$34.825 25 of the public funds. Suit was
brougtit against all the bondsmen in Mo
.doc County. Hosselkus claimed that
HeaJey's residence and interests were in
Lassen County, and that therefore Modoc
County instituted the suit- In the wrong
locality. The court holds that as all the
other bondsmen had their residences in
Modoc County and as Healey held prop
erty there no mistake was made by the
officials in bringing suit where they did.
James Richardson, convicted of stealing
95 cents from Frank Geary, was granted
a new trial on the ground that the Judge
of the lower court ha.d erroneously
charged the jury. The Judge directed
that a verdict of guilty be found if the
jury was convinced that Richardson took
any personal property of Geary's. The
opinion of the Supreme Court says that
such a charge would cover the theft of a
Jack-knife or anything else not mentioned
In the indictment.
IMPROVED BED MEN
HOLD MASS-MEETING}
Discus's Proposition of Building a
Nevr Sail for the Order on
Golden Gate Avenue.
There was ,a large attendance of the
members . of the local tribes of the Im
proved Order of Red Men, the local coun
cils of the Degree of Pocahontas and of
the tribes and councils of Alameda Coun
ty at the mass-meeting held last night in
the assembly hall of the Post-street "Wig
wam. The meeting was called to Â¦ order
by Past Great Sachem George W. Col
| lins, who in a succlnfct manner outlined
,the object of the meeting. After an In
strumental selection Past Great Sachem
A. Jackson, who is a practical builder,
gave an outline of the building which it
is proposed to erect on Golden. Gate ave
nue. He said that the Idea is to have a
two-story and mezzanine building of
brick and stone, with stores on the ground
floor. It Is to be fitted up specially to
meet the needs of the order. The plan
includes a large council hall, reception
rooms for gentlemen and ladies, a smok
ing-room and a number, of tribe rooms to
accommodate the tribes and councils of
this city, together, with offices for the
great chief of records.
J. Harry Hutaff, secretary of the ex
ecutive committee, gave a detailed acount
of what had been done. up to the present
time in the matter of soliciting the tribes
to assist in the undertaking. He stated
that it will require at least . one-half as
much more as has already been sub
scribed to enable the association to pro
ceed with the erection of the new build
ing..
J: A. Filcher epoke at some length on
the subject of homes for fraternal organi
zations, and gave the result of his ob
servations in Eastern cities. He urged
individual members of the order to assist
the project, which, as had been said by

The best musical talent in the city Is

sidio bands will discourse music and forty
blue jackets will sing. All society is man
ifesting the greatest interest in the event
and already over half of the boxes have
been disposed of. - No stone is being left
unturned to make the fiesta an unprece
dented success.
Young society women are painting beau
tiful posters with which to advertise the
entertainment These posters are done In
water colors and represent various scenes
in the life of the gallant mariner, and also
naval views. One oi the most artistic and
novel of these posters was prepared by
Miss Keeler of Berkeley and represents a
battleship majestically steering Â¦â¢_ her
course through the ' white-capped waves.
Mrs. McCalla ; Intends to preserve thtse
paintings and use them to decorate the
walls of the clubhouse. - .
Place Has Been Secured.
But it Is not the wlah of Mrs. McCalla
and her husband that the clubhouse
should be constructed entirely by contri
butions from a few wealthy people. They
desire that this great and necessary home
for the country's gallant tars shall be
built by the general public and that all
the people shall have an opportunity to
contribute toward Its erection. Hence
the. entertainment on the 3d of April.
Society's belles and matrons are busily
planning attractions for the big enter
tainment which Is to be given on the first
Thursday night after the close of. Lent.
This entertainment, or rather musical
fiesta, Is to be given for the benefit of
the fund' which la being raised for the
construction of a clubhouse at Vallejo
for. the United States bluejackets. One
hundred ' young ladies of society are as
sisting in the arrangements, and they
have promised : a surprise, but they will
not take the public into their confidence.
The idea of constructing a home for the
mariner was first suggested by Captain
B..H. McCalla. who haa given over $5000,
the prize money which he won during the
Spanish war, for the purchase of a site
at Vallejo. He and his wife are doing
all in their power to Interest others in
the project. Colonel R.. M. Thompson of
New York City and Henry Phlpps, both
of whom are stanch friends of the sailors,
have . each subscribed . $1000. Miss Helen
Gould, Mrs. Phebe , A. Hearst, C. R-
Bishop of Honolulu and Mrs. George W.

put themselves in my hands, without a penny
of charge, feeling that having been blessed with
the ability to cure disease when others fail, it
is my duty to help, those who cannot help them-

Professor Adkin showed the reporter scores of
letters from Doctors, Clergymen, Statesmen.
Educators, College Professors, Lawyers and
others high in life who have been cured by
Vitaopathy, as well as letters from many men
and women from all walks of life who availed
themselves of his free offer of help, and the
reporter left with a strange feeling of encour-
agement, believing that he had met the most
wonderful man of the aee.
The following axe a few extracts from letters
which the reporter examined personally:
He ea.id: "I cannot attempt to tell you what
my treatment is which I call 'Vitaopathy." In
these days of quackerr and fakes every ad-
vance in science it imitated by a score of igno-
rant charlatans who pretend to have mastered
its details. V.'ere I to attempt to explain to
you for publication the practice of Vltaopathy,
Â¦without discussing its every phase, which I
have not time to do, there would be a dozen
unscrupulous persons pretending to understand
its use before the publication has been out a
week. Vitaopathy Is not Christian science, it is
not Hypnotism nor Divine Healing. It is infin-
itely more thorough and far-reaching than any
of them.
"Vitaopathy is a subtle force of nature, reg-
ulating the intellectual and spiritual being
which controls the physical man. It puts the
system in a receptive condition, which enables
the body to receive the full benefit of my Vita-
opathic vegetable remedies which are used in
combination with it.
"It is true that this new treatment is every
day making wonderful cures. It "has cured the
blind, it has made the lame walk, it has cured
various ure&nic troubles, which had brought the
sufferers to death's door. And here let me ask
you to announce to all the readers of your pa-

A reporter called upon Professor Adkin a few
Â¦weeks ago. He found a man of commarnlins
figure, whose personality was masterful and re-
freshing. His eyes, though full of kindliness,
seemed to penetrate one's very thoughts, while
his every act and every word spoke of honesty
and' consideration of others. He is clearly a
man of. wonderful force of character. ...

W39 MARKET STREET, IThe Alaskan Is one of the biggest
freighters in the. world and far and away
the largest craft of her kind ever seen in
this port. She will carry 14,c4S tons of
freight and 2700 tons of coal In her bunk
ers. She is 510 feet long. 56 feet beam and
has 43 feet depth of hold. . S!je cost about
$650,000 and will make about eleven kno*s.
Captain Banfield. the commodore captain
of the line. Is to be her first commander.
Herysmokestack weighs twenty-three tons
and her rudder weighs eight tons. She
has" seven hatches and twenty-three
booms for .working cargo. One of these
booms will handle fifty tons as- easily as
fifty pounds. Three gangs of men can
â¢work slmultaneoiTPly at one ha'cTt.
The Alaskan will be ready for her trial
trip by the end of the month, and soon
after that will go into commission. Sho
THE American-Hawaiian Steamship
Company's giant freighter Alas
kan was placed high and dry on
the Hunters Point drydock yes
terday. The dock as ordinarily
used wouldbe too smallfor a vessel of
the Alaskan's dimensions. To get her b'.g
hulk Into the huge basin it was necessary
to raise the resting blocks to a height of
eight feet, and thus take advantage cf the
upper part of, the slope at ihe inner end
of the dock. The vessel's rudder was re
moved. When docked the bsw was just
two Inches from the inside siii. and there
was only three inches to spare at the
other end. Experts dec are the docking
to be one of the cleverest bits of en
gineering ever performed in this port.
The work of docking the leviathan was
handled by G-eneraf Superintendent John
Beaton and Dockxnaster John Heubacher,
both of whom were very proud of the
successful result of their careful calcula
tions. â¢ ?

NEW YORK, March 22.â Judge Townsend,
in the United States District Court to-day, de

AN INSOLVENT . HOUSEWIFE.â Jane
Thompson of Wrights, Santa Clara County,
filed a petition in insolvency yesterday in the
United States District Court. ..Her petition
describes her as "by occupation a lady and
housewife." She falls, as one of the stock
holders of the Insolvent Union Savings Bank
of San Jose, her liabilities being $-13,867. She
has no assets.
His acquaintances call him "Brick." . He is
famous as a sea lawyer and during the last
voyage of the ship Eclipse ' was^ the terror of
the forecastle and a thorn In the flesh of those
responsible for discipline on board. Sailors are
scarce just now and skippers have little choice
of material, so "Brick" was shipped for a sec
ond trip on the Eclipse and helped to man the
capstan yesterday morning when the time came
to warp the ship from Green street wharf. The
Eclipse has a new second mate who knew, not
"Brick." Â»
"Here you," said the new mate, tapping
â¢Brick' on the shoulder, "Just shove a few
pounds harder. We want no soldiering aboard
this ship." W9*fi-- ' '
â¢Brick' jumped as if stung. He dropped his
hold on the capstan bar and walked toward the
officer.
"What d' you mean by laying hands on me?
Take t:.at."
"Brick"" swung for the mate's head. The
mate dodged and planted right and left on the
sailor's Jaw. "Brick" blinked. The mate Cei
lowed with an uppercut that dropped "Brick"
to the deck. "Brick" recovered his feet and
with a wild whoop rushed at the mate, who
sidestepped and sent a strong left to the sailor's
ear. * .
The forecastle made an awkward ring and to
the crowd on the wharf it seemed as if one or
both combatants would surely topple over
board. x It was big enough for the new second
mate, however. â¢ "Brick" tried one more rush
and ran his nose into a straight left.
"Now turn to," said the second mate.
"Aye, aye, sir," said "Brick."
Hit the Wrong 1 Mate.
She did hot have much difficulty in find
ing the. creeks and tracing them to the
points Indicated upon the Ciiart where the

her son. who accompanied her, then
staked off- claims on â¢ several different
leads, as indicated on the chart, and. they
intend -to return later in tne ytar and
make a complete prospect of the district.
On the richest ledge indicated on the
plan specimens of free gold valued at $400
to the ton were found," and some of these
have, been brought toythis city to â¢ be
passed upon -by persons Interested In the
exploitation of the district. The speci
mens are fully as good as those found by
Mrs. Heckleton and her first husband
when they found the ledge twenty years
ago, and it is' expected that the claims
will prqve to be immensely rich.

By this time the excitement had cooled
down and the man was placed under ar
rest, and taken to jail. To-day he was ar
raigned before a ; Justice of the Peace,
who ordered his release.
Cheap cigars, watches, diamonds, silks
and laces -were sold for ten times their
value, and there seemed to be no end to
the demand. Finally a woman exclaimed
"I have been robbed." Thl3 brought the
crowd to its senses and it rushed upon
the faker. The latter drew two revolvers
and for a time held the townsmen at bay,
but finally one, braver than the others,
climbed upon the platform and wrested
the weapons from the owner. Then it
was found they were not loaded.
The people turned out en masse and
when the announced time arrived the
faker stepped' upon the platform and of
fered for sale a watch for JL When this
was disposed of It was immediately
bought back by the seller for 31 50. A
few prizes in money were given away to
the first purchasers, and then the rush
began. Â¦ Â¦
The stranger advertised that- he would
give an entertainment In the town hall
l'ree of charge last night, and would sell
some very valuable goods at ridiculously
low prices. .
LOMPOC, March 22.â A prosperous-look
ing strangerâ probably one ' of the gang
that has been picking- up a little "easy"
money in Santa Clara and .other coast
towns â drifted Into Lompoc yesterday,

Colonel C. E. Tuller of 1201 Euclid ave-
Iiue, Cleveland, Ohio, says: "My success
In curing afflicted people is absolutely
â¢wonderful. A boy given up for sure death
by flve physicians I restored to perfect
health inside of flve minutes. A woman
that could not touch her foot to. the
ground on account of rheumatism was
cured by one application of the method
explained in your system."
Felix Moosbrugger of 276 Halsey street,
Newark. N. J., writes: "Many are the
Â¦windllcg deals I have avoided in my
father's business through my knowledge
of your system. The change which has
taken place in my personal character Is
eimply marvelous. I have developed a
confidence and power in myself that I
never dreamed I could acquire."
S. I. Tetter of Middletown, Pa., says:
"The 'Kl-Magt' System of personal inliu-
ence has brought me the success in busi-
ness for which I have been looking. It is
the magnet which controls. There is no
guesswork about Itâ it is a scientific fact.
It has taught me to know and control
myself as well as others."
This wonderful new force gives a con-
trol and an influence over, persons that
wcuid astonish and mystify the most
powerful hypnotist who ever lived.. It
enables you to know the secret natures
and lives of every one you meet; you can
tell the character, abilities and entire na-
ture of your correspondents, though thou-
sands of miles away. Tou can exert a
Btrange silent influence over others In
your presence or at a distance entirely
without their knowledge. You can quick-
ly develop your will power, memory and
other mental faculties to a marvelous de-
gree. You can by a new secret process
quickly cure bad chronic diseases and
build up your own health and strength in
an incredibly short space of time. It ex-
plains the most marvelous system of phy-
sics! and mental development known lo

of charming, the art of fascination. You
can win and hold friends without number.
You can master the secrets and know the
power of the wise men of old. You can
acquire that inward confidence, that mag-
netic power that will enable you to over-
come all obstacles to success, and rise to
a position of prominence in your commu-
nity. The book enthusiastically In-
dorsed by ministers of the gospel, busi-
ness and professional men. It is a work
which should be In every home. This<
wonderful new work Is entitled "The 1 Se-
cret of Power." It fully explains the uses
and possibilities of the marvelous "Ki-
Magi" system of personal influence. It
lays bare the mysteries of magnetic con-
trol. It gives you a veritable key to the
souls of men. It Is richly, illustrated by
the finest half-tone engravings. It is by
far the most remarkable, interesting and
thrilling work of the kind ever written.
For a limited time it will be sent to your
address absolutely free. "In your 'Kl-
Magl' System I have found what I for
years searched for in vain," writes Mr.
Joseph Steiner. 1100 Ninth street, N. W. f
"Washington, D. C. '.'It has changed the
whole trend of my thought and given my
life a new meaning. I feel younger and
stronger every day. I nnd in it the key lo
business success." W. Rockwell Kent of
Binghamton, N. Y., writes: "Your Ki-
Magi System is the most powerful agency
on earth for the betterment of man. All
Â¦who master It will become a power in the
world and be successful and happy."
At last the true secret'of mental power
and mind control has been revealed. A
noted college in the city of New York has
just issued a wonderful book by eminent
scientists, which lays bare the mysteries
of personal Influence. Five thousand
copies of this remarkable work are to be

pi My success In curing- those functional

H is due to my full understanding; as to
H the causative conditions, and to my ato-

H cannot possibly be remedied by any

A STAKE WINNER
City' Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Supervisors yesterday that he is un
able to figure as to "what the probable
amount of judgments against the city and
county win be for the coming fiscal
year." He advises that no pro\islon be
made in the budget for the payment of
such judgments, because if any money
judgments were obtained. against the city
they could be paid either out of the ur
pent necessity fund or out of the surplus
fund at the end of the fiscal year. Lane
bays further:
"During the three years of my incum
bency but one money judgment has been
obtained against the city, and that in
the Rohfeld case, arising out of the work
of a mob at the Presidio, and to indem
nify the city for its loss In this matter
(11.375 40) a bill iÂ« now pending â¢ in Con
fTess. This statement does not include
tuits to recover taxes paid under protest
-nr upon 1822-3 claims. There are now no
judgments for protested taxes standing
apair.st the city and I presume that the
judgments upon the 1E92-3 claims were all
paid under the constitutional amendment
of 1900. So that at present there are no
judgments which should be provided for
in the new budget." ."./. J

Mergenthaler-Horton Grape Basket Machine in Operation.

The great profits which accrue to those
who foster enterprises at the right. stage
is shown by the colossal "'fortunes -made

profit by furnishing the needed sums for
working capital, and then, after the
company- so floated is in working order,
sells the stock to the public at a value
which will bring, as returns only fair In-

or $1000, or even $25? Â¦ /
HOW MONEY- MULTIPLIES.
Not one machine will be leased to any
one else or put on royalty, as it Is the
purpose of the company to fully control
the fruit basket Industry. Its batteries
of machines will be located at different
points in the richest fruit-growing terri-
tories.
I No other machine*has ever been made
for the manufacture of fruit baskets, and
the patents controlled by this Company
are so fundamental and basic in character
that any attempt to construct such a ma-
chine â¢ must Involve infringements which
will-be immediately stopped by injunc-
tion:' â¢- ' .': â¢ *>,'Â¦â¢ - - Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ ' 'Â¦ .
There has been ample demonstration,
too, of the ability, of these machines to do
all that is claimed for them. A number
of the basket machines have been in op-
eration for over a year at the factory
of Robison & Co., at Painesville, Ohio, and
this factory, because of its ability to turn
out baskets cheaper than any of the hand
mills, and of a better, grade, has been
taxed to its fullest capacity. Persons wh,o
have contemplated' the purchase of con-
siderable blocks of stock have visited
Painesville-for.the purpose of seeing the
machines in operation.
The sight of the machines In full opera-
tion has been in. every instance an irre-
futable â¢ argument and has made many
stanch friends for the Company.
One thousand of these machines ' will
manufacture the entire number of baskets
for. grapes berries and other fruits that
are annually demanded In the United
States.

of the hand-labor involved in the manu-

demand for fruits of all kinds is steadily
growing for every purpose.
Never was there a greater need "than
Some idea of the prospects of this com-

Commission merchants . who have han-
dled fruit in baskets made by these ma-
chines now demand that their shippers
pack In such baskets Instead of the hand-
made. This, of course, has been, and still
is. for the most part, an impossibility,
since there are only about forty machines
manufactured and In operation; but with
the present far-reaching plans of the ten
million dollar company that has -under-
taken to develop thW great commercial
and manufacturing enterprise, the use of
the machine basket will soon become uni-
versal from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Â¦
Few people understand how great an
Industry the making of baskets for our
great fruit crops has become, or how
much effort the getting together of the
enormous number of baskets every year
involves. When you take into account
that it requires over TWO BILLION
BASKETS to hold and market the grapes
and berries and peaches of this country
the importance of the saving of labor in
connection with the manufacture of bas-
kets becomes instantly j>!ain. This vast
number of new baskets is now required
every year for our fruit, and the demand
is constantly increasing as fruit-growing
projects multiply. < In many sections of
our country whole train loads of berries

Fancy a single machine that will turn

These Basket Machines are so wonder-
fully efficient that one machine, with one
girl operator, does the work of twelve
expert handworkers and does its work
perfectly, -turning; out baskets that ate
absolutely uniform, stronger and better
In every way than handworkers can pos-
sibly produce.
In the same way that the Linotype has
superseded typesetting by hand and the
sowing machine has made sewing by hand
an almost forgotten thing, the automatic
Basket Machines Invented by Ottmar
Mergenthaler and Emmett liorton are
doing away with making baskets by hand
labor, which until the introduction ot
these machines was the only known way
of making baskets for our Immense crops '
of grapes, berries, peaches and general
fruit. They are lifting this great and
growing industry out of the plodding stage
and driving it by leaps and bounds into I
the forefront of progression.
If there should be any person who does
not know all about the wonderful llerg-
enthaler Linotype machines and what
they have done for typesetting all over
the world, let such person Inquire of some
friend who is a printer or publisher.
All discriminating investors know that
the great secret of the success of the
Mergenthaler Linotype Company is that
It is founded upon the 60lld rock of Ott-
mar Mergen thaler's invention, which
saves money and controls Its field.
All Investors know how the prosperity
of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company
has developed Into almost phenomenal
proportions. They know, too, how the

how it revolutionized typesetting and
made the modern newspaper possible.
Nearly -everybody knows how repeated
efforts have been made to copy and In-

It is now conceded . that Edward I.

that that was his verdict; that the court
had ordered that the verdict be recorded;
the verdict was recorded and the jury an
swered collectively thereto, and. then thU
motion was made."

"Well," said the Juror, continuing, "You

reported among the early day cases of
California. It was a civil case, and the
Supreme Court held that It did not make
any difference whether. or not the juror

Among the legal fraternity there seems
to be a well defined opinion that Duncan
cannot be^ tried , again for his offense. .It
is the consensus of oplnlon'that both the
trial court and the Supreme Court will
hold that way when the matter Is brought
up for hearing.
. Whether Sherry's blunder is the -result
of, his ignorance of the law or whether
there is another motive, behind it is not
known. The general impression, however,
Is that Sherry. simply went into the jury
box thinking that so long as he qualified
as a Juror it did, not make any difference
what his name was. .As a- result of his
blunder â¢â¢ there is Â¦ quite a likelihood that
Duncan will . be, set at liberty. At all
events it will cause a legal entanglement
that - will undoubtedly keep .the case In

"I am hopeful that : Sherry's act will
constitute what is; known Â¦ in legal par

Barrett when . seen " last night. "If it
does, and I have good reasons for believ
ing . that it . does, Â¦ our client 'will be Â¦. dis
missed. At the very worst our client will
be entitled i to "a : new- trial by 'twelve con

Investigation into the affairs of the
School Department of San Francisco may
result in the collection of back rents. An
expert who has looked into the records
Is convinced that Maximilian Popper owes
the city the sum of $8370.
In 1S92 Popper leased from the Board of
Education for a term of ten years from
July 1, 1S92. that certain school lot, to
gether with the improvements thereon,
situate on the north side of Post street,
midway between Grant avenue and Stock
ton street, occupied by four stores, a
Turkish bathing- establishment, and some
furnished rooms, at a monthly rental of
5755. payable monthly in advance. Up to
and including: the 1st day of January,
1895, he paid the rent as agreed to in the
lease, but rinding that he did not make
quite as much money out of this transac
tion as he had made out of street, sweep
ing, custom-house and mail contracts, he
persuaded successive Boards of Education
to reduce the rental to 5600 per month for
certain specified times herein mentioned.
December 26, 1894, he was granted a re
duction by the Board of Education to $600
per month for one year from January 1,
1695. On February 12, 1896, he was, on the
recommendation of the Judiciary- Com
mittee of the Board of Education, granted
a reduction from $755 per month to $(500
per month from the 1st day of January,
1S96, to the 1st day of January. 1837.
On the -28th of December, 1896, he was,
on recommendation of the same commit
tee, granted a similar reduction from $755
lo $600 per month from, the 1st day of
January. 1S37, to the 1st day of January,
1898. The records of the Board of Educa
tion have been carefully searched, and
they disclose the fact that no further re
ductions were ever made during the cal
. endar years of 1898, 1899. 1900, 1901 to,the
end of the lease, expiring July 1, 1902.
Popper has been paying rent at the rate
cf $600 a month ever since, although at no
time since the 1 1st day of January, 1838,
have the . directors of the board fixed the
rent at such, figure. Attorneys have ad
vised that when a lease is modified during
it*- life by consent of both parties ' such
modification only runs for the specified
time, and at the expiration thereof the
original terms of the contract become re
vived. There Is therefore due the â¢ city
from Popper the sum. of $8370, being the
difference of $155 per month for fifty-four
months, or, rather, during the years of
189S. 1899, 1900. 1&01 and to July 1, 1902. Pop
per has given a bond of $5000 for â¢ the
Â¦ faithful observance of all the conditions
of the lease, with Judah Boas and ePter
Joseph Kelly as sureties. Under a strict
and technical construction of his contract
he may possibly not be liable for more
than $41So. He may decline, however, to
plead the statute of limitations and pay
the city the whole amount due. It is said
that Popper has amassed money, stocks,
bonds; brick houses, frame houses and
real estate, and is therefore amply - able
to pay the amount justly due 'the School

ALUMNI NINE WINS GAME.
In conclusion Mr. Perry said:
"I 'i should . not have asked your atten
tion to a single .: field of contemporary
letters if- literature were an end in itself.
The proof of-national greatness does not
lie primarily in verse or prose; it is rather
in the cheerful .acceptance of every na
tional responsibility, the glad undertaking
of any sacrifice demanded ; by twentieth
century civilization. J3ut a discussion of
patriotic verse ls,not*wlthout significance
if .it -has; led us to the thought that there
must be some distinctive standard of clv
'ilization in? the United States; some na
tive, test : of -social progress. sSine deep
community of emotional life. Theses are
the prerequisites of t any literature that" Is
worthy of- the name. If American Ideals
remain noble, ' If- American \ life grows in
creasingly rich : and joyous, we; shall not
care very much whether we have national
poetry ; but It is out of that .divine care
lessness, that serene consciousness of vic
torious > enerery, that -poetry; is born."
The audience , then . joined in singing . the
doxolcgy -and the benediction i. was pro
nounced by Rev. . Homer J. Vosburgh,
bringing' the exercises to a close.""- , r s .i'^
"For the political poet is always tempt
ed to declamation; to speech rather than
song. Â¦ Bitter, indignation, burning/ elo
quence, when metrically expressed, have
often the outer form. of poetry; but. they
usually lack its inner spirit. â¢. The violent
phrase is more easily compassed than the
new vision into the heart of things, but
mere violent and resonant phrases are
not- poetry. Most patriotic verse is at
best, a sort .of ; political oratory, a special
plea for a special verdict; it alms to per
suade and convince- rather than liberate
and ' heighten the nobler emotions. ..It
voices the : tenets of. a party instead of
embodying a universal truth. It is seen
in its most effective: form in political sat
ire, like narts of 'Don Juan,' or s. music
hall chorus like "The Absent-Mlnded Beg
grar,' a campaign rallying" cry, 'And . Shall
Trelawny Die.' or a marching, song like
'John Brown's Body.' "
AIMS AT PATRIOTIC VERSE.
Verse bearing on the present war In
South Africa was quoted. The speaker
continued: . .
wrong, because she will perish if you
abandoni her, and her fall is a. greater
evil than Her error.' "
porary verse deserves little notice, that
the elder singers have passed away or are
silenf and that the new voices do riot yet
command one's admiration and regard.
The Contempt expressed for so-called
magazine poetry has become so common
as to pass unchallenged. The 'poet's cor
ner' of the newspaper Is supposed to be a
j corner avoided by the wise. But I do not
share this popular suspicion of the minor,
poet. I believe that American verse is,
upon the whole, and setting aside the first
half-dozen names, better than it was
twenty years or forty years -ago. It
shows a wider range . of thought anÂ£ a
more finished technique. And the amount
of tolerably acceptable verse that some
how gets written in this country is enor
mousâjust how enormous only those who
see It in manuscript can know.
"There is one characteristic, of this
, mass of contemporary verse, published
and unpublished, which is provocative of
curiosity. It Is the relatively humb e rank
as regards both quantity and quality that
is occupied by patriotic poetry. 'Next to
God,' said Cardinal Gibbons the other day
in the Baltimore Cathedral, 'our country
should hold the strongest place in our af
fections.' And yet, if my impression of
the general character of contemporary
verse be correct, our country is not only
less frequently than religion the theme
of poetry, but far less frequently than na
ture or the purely personal Â¦ affections.
More sonnets seem to be written about
John Keats than about the United States
of America. Our better verse writers in
particular are but rarely inspired by na
tional themes." . , :
DEPICTS NATIONAL FEELING.
The speaker supplemented this state
ment with "analyses of the verse based
on Stedman's "American Authology."
Continuing, he Â¦ said:
"Patriotic poetry, to begin with, then,
Is in its larger features an easily recog
nized tyi>e. It is the expression In verse
of national feeling. 'Forty-four forty or
fight!' 'Remember the 'Alamo !', or 'Re
member the Maine!' are /the catchword3
around which poems have readily crystal
lized, though -it i ssingularly illustrative
of the , better and deeper side- of human
nature that 'mere national anger and cu
pidity or revenge have never produced a
! great poem." â¢â¢ .
i The endowment with permanent beauty
! of some 6ymbol of American life by poets
! of this countrv was touched upon. . "The
Star Spangled Banner,'" "Ironsides,"
j "My Captain,~,"Unguarded Gates" and
"At Gibraltar" were cited as examples.
J Referring to 11. Goyan's declaration
I that | internationalism -was evil Mr. Perry
i said: . .
"M. . Goyan declares that trie Â¦ moment
you neglect 'the frontiers,' the natural
j boundaries, the inherited natonal- duties,.
! you let loese individualism; in other word3
| anarchy. 'That" is a most egotistic : con
: elusion,'- he asserts, N ,:which allows a man
| of his. own free will to refuse assistance
to a national undertaking â¢ which in his
ownprivate Judgment is butchery.'
"This is what we call, in America the
'my country, right or wrong' question. It
I has been eloquently argued of late on
I both sides. Ex-President Harrison dls
j cussed it freely and dispassionately in the
i last of his public addresses. , Considered
as an abstract, academic. question. . it is'
not very easy.' to answer. - : Precisely at
; what point ought a minority, in our .-self-'
'Â¦ governing democracy, to yield its right of
. private Judgment. and give "loyall support
to a policy, which it' believes to be;mor
ally wrong, it is hard to say. - But i what-'
ever the theorists may. decide, the rough-'
and-ready popular Judgment of this coun
. try has always been impatient with; such ;
i theorizing, in war time. -And our French
essayist believes. that this popular instinct
is right. He falls back upon the fine say
ing of M.Provost-Paradol,;.' You ought to'
serve , your. country ' even if j she] is iinlthe'
CONTEMPT . FOR POET'S CORNER.
"I 'am. aware -that there is a general im
pression that the great body ofcontem-
VI do wish to take this tenet of our
common creed and apply it to a some
what wider^fleld than that of the individ
ual. The national life, too, is a long pro
cess of education. The nation, like the
individual, tests by experience the value
of its bookish theories, and out of its ex
perience, in turn, spring its vital books.
The history ' of literature . in America Is
the history, more or- less accurately
translated, of American 'life. Not every
phase of national existence, it Js true, re
ceives adequate translation Into litera
ture, and yet most : periods of heightened
national consciousness have found some
sort of literary interpretation.',
"We are living just now. in one of those
moods of quickened national feeling. The
astonishing- achievements of our country
men make us proud of the America that
is Â¦ before our . eyes. We cherish a still
deeper faith in the greater America that
is to be. Is this : faith .voiced as it should
be by our writers? We must limit the in
quiry to a single field of.. letters, and'I
shall choose poetry, because, the . world
over, it Is the poets . who : register most
quickly and most permanently; the. high
tides of national emotion. ,.
"Wherever men and women meet to do
honor to a university, they meet in the
faith that education Is a lifelong' growtn,
not as access to books and teachers for a
few . fortunate years, but a process that
keeps pace with life, that broadens anJ
deepens with experience. We test books
by no less magical a touchstone than life
itself. We search life .unceasingly for tho
evidence of those great hopes which we
have learned from literature.
In part. Dr. Perry said:
The subject chosen by Dr. Perry was
"Literature and National Feeling/' and
It mainly dealt with the lack of distinct
ively American poetry. He analyzed the
compo&lttems x>f many modern French and
English poets and showed how the writers
were imbued with national poetic Inspira
tion. %'3SP&
In the delivery "of his address Dr. Perry
showed himself to be a master of com
position and a deep student of literature.
He is a young man, possesses a commarid
lng though slight physique and his dic
tion is of the clearest. He -was listened
to with the closest attention, and when
he finished his oration the cheering was
renewed.
President "Wheeler was loudly cheered
at the close of his speech, and then intro
duced Dr. Bliss Perry, who v.'as given a
hearty welcome. !

"I am glad it came to-day," said Presi
dent Wheeler. "It was as good to me as
if it had teen half a million. It showed
the love of the alumni for their univer
sity. What is money for if it is not for
things of this kind? People cannot take
their money with them. Here stands tUi.s
university that expresses the best and
highest thoughts and to provide the
training for the best of our youths, to
tell men- how to live, to tell them of im
mortality and their right to be and live
with God."
"Teaching- is an art and can only be
acquired by practice and research. For
that purpose we need a training' 'school
similar to those In Eastern colleges." -
President Wheeler then announced the
receipt of a telescope from Mrs. Herman
Oelrichs; a check for $500 from the widow
of the late Professor Hallidie, being her
annual donation toward the library, and
a check for $1000 from the Alumni Asso
ciation, being a donation to the building

i YT / nies, "Charter day',' was
H f&k / duly celebrated at the
1/ B/ State University at
Â©^ If Berkeley yesterday, and
Â» the thirty-fourth anni
versary of the founding
of the seat of learning was the occasion
for a distinguished gathering.
Regents of the university, learned
teachers of the faculty, men prominent in
the professions and commercial life, rep
resenting the alumni, together with hun
dreds of students of both sexes, met for
the purpose of commemorating the natal
day.
Dr. Bliss Perry, editor of the Atlantic
ta^cnthly, at the invitation of the faculty,
had journeyed to Berkeley from his
tome in the East to deliver the ora
tion cf the day. There were proces
sions of the faculty, the regents, alumni
and students. A vast audience filled Har
mon gymnasium and listened to words of
eloquence from President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler and the guest of the day. The
alumni held a conference as to the best
means of assisting the financial affairs of
their alma mater, while the students mot
in athletic games en the campus and fair
co-eds entertained at their fraternity
house with joyous song.
The blue and gold of the university
could be seen on all sides and the music
of the military band < filled the. air with
pleasing harmonys President and Mrs.
\Vl:eeler entertained the regents and fac
ulty and gave welcome to Whitelaw Reid,
v/ho is to represent the nation at. the cor
onation of England's King, and who, with
his Â¦wife, was prominent in yesterday's
celebration. Â£>. O. Mills, the famous
financier, was also a jrucst of honor and,
with Whitelaw Reid, was "snap-shotted"
on all sides.
BELOVED PROFESSOR MISSING.
Yet hundreds who took part in the cel
ebration telt that there was something
lacking. For the first time in many years
the venerable figure of Professor Joseph
Le Conte was missed from the campus
aiiCl the exercises in Harmon gymnasium,
and considerable surprise was expressed
that no reference to him was made at the
exercises or at the conference of the
aJumni. The man of learning, who was a
jart of the State University since the
day it was founded, and who died in the
I YosÂ«nite Valley on the morning of July
6 of last year, was certainly In the hearts
of thousands at yesterday's celebration,
but they made no sign.
Harmon gymnasium was the scene of
the morning exercises and the- big build
ins was resplendent in blue and gold
bunting. Oflicers of the University Cadet-
Corps acted as .ushers and ticket takers,
and when the doors were opened at 9
o'clock numbers of visitors were ready to
enter.
. Although the day was a Irtight one, a
cold wind swept through the Golden Gate
and there was no display of spring
dresses by the ladies. While the visitors
waited for the processions of regents,
faculty, alumni and students to arrive
the military band of the university dis
coursed several numbers.
STUDENTS MAKE RAFTERS RING
Students to the number of more than
2000 assembled at North and South halls
at 9:30 a. m., ready to march to the, gym
nasium. A. pretty sight was witnessed
when the fair co-eds, forming the choral
society, inarched through the campus to
the gymnasium. The young ladles wore
the regulation â¢ "mortar-board" and black
gowns. On entering the gymnasium they
were greeted with cheers and given seats
close to the platform.
When the students arrived the rafters
of Harmon gymnasium- were made to ring
with college cries and songs. Every one
was in good spirits and the lungs of the
male students in full working order. -^
At 10:15 a. m. the regents, faculty,
alumni and guests of honor started from
the Bacon Art and' Library building,
inarching: in procession to tne gymnasium.
The members of the faculty wore -their
college caps and gowns, together with the
colored hoods indicative of their univer
sity distinctions. Notable in the proces
sion was the figure of the widow of the
late Professor Joseph Le Conte, escorted
by a distinguished member of the faculty.
President Wheeler escorted Dr. Bliss Per
ry, who wore his academic robes.
The entrance of the procession was the
signal for wild cheering: by the student
body. The fealvos of greeting were main
tained until all those in the procession
were seated on the platform.
At the request of President Wheeler the
audience arose and the invocation was
asked by the Rev. Homer J. Vosburgh,
1L A., pastor of the First Baptist Church
of Oakland. The Choral Society then ren
dered a selection, and the opening speech
was delivered by President Wheeler.
PRESIDENT WHEELER SPEAKS.
In the course of "his remarks President
Wheeler said that the university was
rapidly growing. He paid a tribute to the
founders of the university, â¢who. despite
opposition, had laid their foundations
deep. The work of past and present
regenis was reviewed by the speaker and
Â¦with the. faculty was eulogized.
President Wheeler dwelt (upon the love
for the university displayed'by the alumni
and the student body, arid then described
the growth of the university during the
past year. He/ pointed out that funds
were urgently needed to meet the in
creasing number of the students and said
that but for the action of the last State
Legislature it would have been'impossi
ble to carry on the work of the fc lnstitu
tlon.
The president _made a plea for assist
ance to erect new buildings, a college li
brary and a hospital for the students. He
referred to the establishment of new de
partments. Including: those of commerce,
irrigation,, hydraulics, dairy production,
Spauish. Italian. Russian, Chinese and
Japanese. In concluding his speech Presi
dent Wheeler said:
WHAT UNIVERSITY NEEDS.
"The reeds of the university are past
the possibilities of speech. They are
clear before my vision by night and also
by day. Many people would gladly help
if they knew how much good a little as
eistance would do. I have very rarely
asked for help, but when I 'have done so
I .have always met with a cheerful re-
Fponse. Next year, with the Increase of
the btudents. we must hold some of our
classes in^this gymnasium, or cut of doors.
We need a library, we. need a hospital,
and I received word thÂ© other day from
Â«. man who is quietly helping a dozen
Whitelaw Reid and
D. O. Mills Hear
the Address.
Regent Charles S. Wheeler said the
time had come when \ the alumni could
and . should help the university. He said
that every suggestion made at the meet-
In? was a good one. He thought that the
4CC0 alumni' could secure sufficient appro
priations from the next Legislature to
help the university. He deplored the fact
that where I200.COO had been appropriated
by the last Legislature for the university
the ,' sum of $743,000 had been voted for
State prisons and reform schools. He
felt sure that the alumni could spread in
every part of" the State evidence of the
wants of the university . and secure suffi
cient support for the passage of such leg
islation as would give the university the
aid it required. The speaker concluded
his remarks by making his offer to give
J500O to the library fund.
The reeents. faculty and alumni hope
to raise $1,000,000 for the library, one half
of which is to be used for a building and
the other half for the purchase of books
and the formation of an endowment, fund
to secure annual additions to the collec
tion of books.
Resolutions of regret on the deaths of
alumni - in the past two years were car
ried by a. rising vote, and the proceedings
closed.~{&BBMbaiMBMHB>BniM|
"By moral â support." quickly replied
President Wheeler. "There are enough
people to find fault." The answer was
received with cheers.
"The university . is in need of money,"
continued President Wheeler, "and you
can help us on those lines. There are
Â¦many ways In which you can help. The
action of the alumni before the last Leg
islature was of Immense value."
President Wheeler agreed with a sug
gestion that a- list of the needs of the uni
versity be published, showing what could
be done with donations of sums ranging
from $100 upward.
"One of the best things I can think
of," said President "Wbeeler, "is a loan
fund for students. There are many hard
ships suffered by students. Some of them
are living on $8 to J10 per month. A loan
of $50 in such cases would be of great
good. The money would be eventually re
turned. I have always found it so when
ever I had any money to loan."
H President Wheeler made an urgent plea
for the establishment of a library. He
said that the lack of a properly equipped
library prevented prominent men from
coming to the university to teach.
"Men do not want to come out Just to
address the students." he said. "There la
no real education except to come in con
tact with men engaged in research and
investigation. Without a library research
is not possible and we are handicapped."
The president then extended a cordial in
vitation to the alumni to attend & recep
tion in Hearst Hall and left the meeting
amid cheers. â¢
Senator Lukens spoke on the needs of
financial aid to the university and paid *
tribute to President Wheeler for the man
ner In which he had conducted delibera
tions with the last Legislature on. the
question of financial aid.
REGENT WHEELER SPEAKS.
How can the alumni help you in- the
administration of the university?" asked
an alumnus.
President Wheeler was asked to ad
dress the meeting on the needs of thÂ«
university, but he declared that he was
too tired to do so and had given his
views- on the subject In his speech of the
morning in Harmon Gymnasium. He
suggested that questions be put.to> him.
PRESIDENT ANSWERS QUESTION"
F. W. Aitken, one of the publishers of
the California Graduate, said that It was
not fair for the associated alumni to' try
and down his venture alter he and hia
associates had shown the association that
a publication was possible.
President Wheeler, who entered the
hall during the discussion, was called
upon -to speak, and he said that he fa
vored an alumni newspaper controlled by
a committee of the alumni.
The subject was disposed of by the pas
tage of- a resolution that the * desirability
and practicability of an alumni newspa
per be referred to the council, with power
to act, after Aitken had failed to securo
the passage of an amendment that thÂ©
council confer with him and his associ
ates. MM*
Seth Mann, chairman of a committee
appointed to make a report, stated that a
newspaper had recently started up, con
ducted by some alumni as a private en
terprise. He did not favor the alumni
association indorsing a private venture,
but that they should control the publica
tion in the flame manner as /the college
periodicals of Eastern colleges. Charles
A. Ore en spoke on similar lines.
NEED A COLLEGE PAPEB.
There was a long discussion on the sub
ject of an alumni newspaper, the need
of which bad been suggested by President
Wheeler.
Tho proceedings opened with an ac
count of the previous conference given
by Charles A. Green, president of the
Berkeley Alumni Society, when it was
decided to form alumni clubs In every
part of the State.
The^ feature of the proceedings was &
spirited speech delivered by 'Attorney
Charles A. Wheeler, an alumnus of the
university and one of the regents. He
closed his remarks by offering' to give
$5000 toward a library fund and asked,
that ninety-nine alumni of the State Uni
versity make similar donations.
Many of the alumni present belonged to
the gentler sex, and they took an active
part in the proceedings. T. A. Perkins,
president of the council of the associa
tions of alumni, was in the chair, and, Ed
ward. Booth acted as secretary.
a LARGE number of alumni ' of

Four years ago Luis W- Loaiza married
Henriqueta Donde. He vras the scion of
a wealthy, aristocratic Spanish family,
and she the daughter of Ricardo Donde,
who earned his bread by the sweat of his
brow and to whom life was an uphill
struggle The mesalliance displeased the
family of the bridegroom, and he was de
nied admittance to the home of his youth.
But It was a case of love with Luis and
he forbore his parents' wrath, commenc
ing life anew," dependent only on what he
earned himself to support his young wife.
A year after the marriage the child, Jose,
was born. ' . .
Two years ago Luis manifested signs of
neglect for his wife. He became shiftless
In his workand after a semi-reconciliation
with his parents, accepted whatever pit
tance they would give him. The money
he received thus did not go toward the
support of his wife and child, however,
but was spent in reckless pleasure.
Finally Mrs. Loaiza developed signs â¢' of
incipient consumption. When she became
ill one year ago her husband deserted her,
permitting her to provide for the child
and herself, while ne went, back to live
in the family mansion, pampered by its
Mrs. Loaiza died on the seventh day of
January of. the present year, leaving the
Scion of Wealthy Family.
AFTER three years of turbulent
life, in which abject poverty was
the chief adjunct, little Jose M.
Luis Loaiza has been provided
with a legal guardian and steps
will be taken by his attorney. ex-Judge
A B Treadwell, to recover about $125,000
which, It is alleged, is due him from the
estate of his grandfather, the late Wen
ceslao Loaiza, who left a million dollars
to his wife and children.
Mrs. Carlota Donde. maternal grand
mother of the baby boy-, was declared its
legal guardian â¢ yesterday by Superior
Judge Carroll Cook. She lives in humble
lodgings at 1212 Clay -street. Just around
the corner from the mansion of the rlqn

todian of the child, and who will probably
make further contest .when the-matter
of the -distribution of., the estate comes

STANFORD SPRINTER BlJNS
A FAST EIGHTH MILE
Another important opposition was made
on the ground that the father, Luis, re
quested that his sister be intrusted' with
the custody of his offspring. In support
of this a letter received from Mexico was
introduced in evidence. It read:, :
"I nominate my sister, Dolores Loaiza,
guardian of my son, Luis, and request the
court to .appoint her. his guardian."
Another : objection .mart e was that . tha
child had no estate or property 'of any
kind or character within this State, hence
there was no necessity fora legal guar
dian. But Judge Cook ruled otherwise
and Mrs. Donde was' appointed. - , â¢â¢ r
It is understood by Mrs. Donde that tha
father will dispute the legal right of his
wife to his portion of the estate, left by
Wenceslao Loaiza, and this will naturally
Involve the rights of the child. Next week
Attorney Treadwell Â¦ will sue for the
baby's maintenance. - and it is expected
that this .will be the. preliminary, of ' a
bitter contest in the courts..
I/etter Comes From. Mexico.
On June 8, 1900, old Wenceslao Loaiza,
father of Luis,' died at his home in thia
city, and left an 1 estate valued at $1,000,000.
In his will he provided that the bulk of
his local possessions ' sjiould go â¢ to - his
aged wife, but; specified that lands and
holdings in the State, of Sonora, Mexico,
should be divided, share and share alike,
among his wife and his five children, Luis
included. He also specified that upon the
death of his wife her property should 1 be
distributed among. the five children. Ac
cording to papers placed on record in the
court Luis signed his entire right â¢ and
title to his portion of the estate to. his
wife 'on August 6, 3901. The valuation of
this portion is said to be in the neighbor
hood of $125,000. and the claim of the child
will be" made for it, since its mother is
dead. " Â¦
Mrs. Carlota Donde applied for letters
of guardianship of the child on February
20 through Attorney. Treadwell. Her peti
tion was opposed by Miss Dolores Loaiza,
sister of the child's father, on several
grounds. The first ground was that Mrs.
Donde is without means and wholly un
able to properly or otherwise care for,
maintain, support or educate the, baby.

"Chlswlck Church was passed in eleven
minutes thirty-nine seconds by the lead
ers. At the beginning 'of Dukes Mead
ows Huntley called on his men for the ef
fort of their lives. They mu3t catch Cam
bridge now or never. \The Americans and
English heaved to their work with des
perate energy, but the boat would not re
spond. Whether she was overstrained or
her lines were entirely a mistake, as
most judges think,, she certainly did no
credit to Dr. Warre when the pace was
most wanted. Nothing seemed to close
that fatal gap, and before Barnes Bridge
was reached, in fifteen minutes' flTty-six
seconds, Cambridge, rowing with - Im
mense vigor and dash, crossed to the bct-
Oxford's Boat Is Handicapped.
"Cambridge made the gap two lengths
of open water under Hammersmith's
bridge, which was passed in seven min
utes twenty-two seconds, Oxford beinff
more than ten seconds behind. This ad
vantage the light blues retained for some
time, but after passing Chlswlck Eyot
Oxford made a 'magnificent spurt, In
which the power and swing of J. G. Mil
burn and Long were especially remarked
by the spectators. The result was soon
seen, for the dark blue oars went slowly
up and wiped a length ort the lead, but
they, could do no more.
"The weather was frightful, but there
.was not much wind, walch fact favored
Cambridge. Both secured a. good start,
and Cambridgo put In thirty-eight strokes
to Oxford's thirty-seven in the .first min
ute. At the end of that period Cambridge
began to establish a lead, which waa
never lost. At the Crabtree Cambridge
was a length ahead, the first mile being
covered in four minutes forty seconds in
a heavy storm of rain.
"At Harrod's both crews were rowing
thirty-two strokes to the minute. Young
MUburn, at "two," was doing good work
at this point, while his big brother, at
"five." was heaving his weight on so that
the water boiled about his blade.
Race Is Bowed in Bad Weather.
"Cambridge won the boat race by more
than five lengths. F6r the first time in
the history of the race Two Americans
rowed in one crew. Unluckily, the broth
ers MUburn were not in the winning boat.
"Many of the critics put down Oxford a
failure to the fact that they rowed in a
boat not suited to them. Dr. "Warre de
signed-a new boat for this year's "race,
which differed from his model of last
year, but it was quite unsuited to the
Oxonians, with the result that they were
obliged to use the boat which had been
strained In last year's race and in ,thla
year's practice. Cambridge, on the other
hand, was exactly suited with. a new and
splendidly built boat.

NEW YORK. March 23.â There is a
possibility that bridge work on the great
structure known as the East River bridge
and all other Iron work on buildings In
the course of construction In New York
will come to a sudden stop on May 1 next,
the Brooklyn Eagle will say to-morrow.
On or before that date, the representa
tives of the Housesmiths' and Bridge
smiths' Union will demand an advance of
wages from their present scale) to forty
cents an hour. Unless their demands are
met with they are determined to stop
work throughout the entire county. If
they so decide, work will not only bo
stopped on the new custom-house build
ing and structures In the course of erec
tion for several largo department store*
In Manhattan, but also on the other two
contemplated bridges.
As a matter of fact -work will be tied tip
in all directions where steel and Iron
workers are concerned. This will not
only affect the completion of the cable
making on the Eastern district bridge,
but will also stop the work of .erecting
the steel work for the suspended struc
ture across the river, which Is In the
hands of the Pennsylvania Steel Com
pany. The Pennsylvania Steel Company
id part of the American Bridge Company.
Even at this early date demands have
been made to the Pencoyd Bridge Works
for an advance In wages. The demand is
for 40 cents -an hour for structural . and
bridge construction workers. All bridge
workers are membes of the Housesmiths'
and Bidseamiths' Union. It Is known that
D. F. Mclntyre of Pittsburgh national sec
retary, has received the vote from at
least thirty lodges, each in favor of de
manding the advance for 40 cents per
hour for eight hours as a day's work.

Prevention of Vice; arrived in San Rafael
this morning and instituted a search 't or
the former's missing daughter, Miss Gus

has been away from her home for several
months, and the father had . finally
learned that she was with Eklund in this
city. '-:.' ?.-Â¦ Â¦ ' - - " Â¦- .
h, klund was found to-day at the place
where', he is employed.- When the irate
parent threatened his arrest he -said If
he were allowed to change his. attire he
would' at once marry Miss Freund. In
stead of keeping his word Eklund began
preparations for a ' hasty departure.'
Freund and Kane then went to the 1 Dis
trict Attorney's office to swear to com
plaints. Eklund, advised of the course of
events, just before the warrant was
served, saved himself by procuring a mar
riage license,
Mr. Freund was not satljtfed until he

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Medical Superintendent Dozier of Napa
believes that Cheeseman is not insane.
He believes that he should be sent to a
penitentiary and not to an insane asylum.
He says he would have discharged Cheese
man long ago. only he felt that such ac
tion would only result In the fellow being
sent back to an asylum again.
The officers are hunting all over the
vicinity of Napa in their endeavor to lo
cate him.
Cheeseman is a dangerous man and has
given the asylum authorities here a great
deal of trouble. -
NAPA. March 22.â Frank H. Cheeseman
made his escape from the asylum by
sawing the bars and padlocks of his room.
In sawing the heavy bars Cheeseraan
used a piece of rough-edged wire, with
a nail in it, and twisted and twisted until
one of the bars bent enough under the
strain to be removed from Its place. He
then let himself down to the ground by
a rope made out of sheeting and took to
the hills back of the asylum.- His escape
was soon discovered by the night watch.
Dr. Bozier Says He Should Be Sent to
J?risozi.
BELIEVES CHEESEMAN SANE.
This is Cheeseman's third successful es
cape from a State hospital. His danger
ous mania, well known in this city, is ren
dered doubly serious because the maniac
has a vein of insane cunning that will
stand him In good stead in his efforts to
elude his pursuers.
He was again recaptured, after three
months of liberty, being identified fn Mon
tana, whence he was returned September,
1899, to Napa.
After the shooting the maniac went to a
number of saloons and telephoned to po
lice headquarters that he had done the
shooting. He was captured that night.
After being held for trial Cheeseman was
committed to the State hospital at Ukiah.
but subsequently was pronounced eane.
Returned to Oakland for trial, he again
became violent and 'was committed to the
Napa hospital, from which he escaped In
January. 1KW. He was recaptured a month
later. In June, 1S99, Cheeseman again es
caped. While he was at large the mys
terious assault occurred upon H. B. Bel
den, a prominent insurance man, who re
sided at Lake and Oak streets. Belden
was called to his door at midnight and
was met by a stranger, who tried to brain
Belden with an ax.- Cheeseman was sus
pected of the attack.
Cheeseman lived in North Oakland,
where he tried by jumping from a wind
mill fan to end his life, following that by
leaping from a ferry-boat, by taking poi
son several times, and each time escap
ing death. After his first discharge from
a State hospital Cheeseman was rational
for a time, but in August, 1898, he shot
and killed Henry Brook, stepfather of
Mi5s Etta Payne, whom he also shot at
their home, 136 Se\enth stieet. The young
woman had become acquainted with the
madman during his lucid interval, but
learned of his previous mental aberration
and then refused to meet him. One even
ing Cheeseman called at the house and
whfn the girl answered his ring began
shooting. Brook was killed while he was
trying to save the girl. She was badly
wounded, but recovered.
The patient's record is a continuous per
formance of murderous acts, coupled with
nine attempts he made to kill himself
while under the bane of his violent mania.
Frank H. Cheeseman. murderer and ma
niac, has escaped from the State Hospital
at Napa. and the police have been warned
that he is heading for Oakland, the scene
of the fugitive's several homicidal deeds.
Chief of Police Hodgrkins has taken steps
to capture Cheeseman as soon as the
bloodthirsty runaway shall arrive,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Brcadway, March 22.
"I had no intention of trying to stop
the rush when I went up on the hill, for
I saw that would be useless. I heard the
noise, as every one In town must have,
and went there to see what was going on.
I soon saw. The matter has not been
put before the committee, nor so far as
I know has any action been taken by any
one. I am really not able to say what
will be done." " \
The war time Is not yet over, for the
faculty now appears In view and no
student knows which way this mighty
host will turn. Professor Babcock says
that the committee to which he belongs
has taken no action and- at this time he
does not know what will be done. He
Â¦aid this afternoon:
Even in defeat the sophomores have
some things to be cheerful over. The
** '05" was not recognizable on the hiÂ»l
this morning, for It was rubbed out by
struggling masses of humanity, and the
man with the dislocated shoulder is a
freshman.
Three or four seniors witnessed the
rush, and some twenty Juniors. To the
latter the sophomores lay their defeat,
for they say that the juniors cut the
freshmen loose as fast as tied. Professor
Babcock reached the battle-field in time
to see the struggle, but he took no band
either as an arbitrator or otherwise. J.
M. Eshlexnan, president of the student
body, was also there and tried to keep
peace, but In vain.
The rush was one of the best in years,
so the old timers who saw it say, and the
young fellows who took part offer testi
monials in its behalf. A dislocated shoul
der for one. assorted black eyes, cut lips,
bloody noses and to-day a certain stiff
ness of the joints speak volumes for the
"time" the students had In the darkness
on the new San Juan. The man with the
dislocated shoulder is carefully hidden
away in a fraternity house and will be
reported on the sick list for some time.
His injury is not serious.
At 4 o'clock a. m. the battle opened. The
freshmen, some hundred strong, were on
a hillside defending their class number,
and down on them marched the enemy,
eighty in number. With a yell the at
tackers charged and then all was tur
moil.
The night's business may â¢ be the un
doing of many an otherwise promising
lad. for rushing is a forbidden luxury at
the University of California. It is against
all faculty rules and regulations and the
cold xinger of retribution is bound to point
out the men who disobeyed, and were
caught.
The struggle came about .through the
old time custom, inaugurated in the days
when rushing was a part of the curricu
lum at college, of freshmen going up on
the hills behind the university on the
night before Charter day and putting
their class number in large letters of
white on the green below. Naturally
when morning came the sophomores
â¢would rise in anger at the sight of their
rivals' number in characters which could
be seen for miles around. This led to
rushes, a practice which has not been
abolished, despite faculty edicts.
The freshmen went up on the hills last
night to place upon one their number,
"" '05." and the sophomores followed aJler.
Numerous preliminary skirmishes oc
curred In the small hours which follow
after midnight and the fires of warring
camps blazed from Grizzly Peak to Co-ea
Canyon. The noise of the skirmishing
hosts was all that the occasion demanded
and ended the sleep of many a weary
professor in the eastern part of town.
Cheer on cheer and shouts of threats and
banter echoed and re-echoed through the
hills. They awoke one man at least whom
the students now calculate would better
have slumbered on in peace. Professor
K. C. Babcock of the students' affairs
committee was aroused by the lung
demonstration and he went up on the hill
to see what wat the matter.
BERKELEY, March 22.â Battle raged
between the freshmen and sophomores
of the University of California on the
hills back of the State institution build-
Ings in the darkness of early this morn
ing. The sophomores were defeatedâ tied
with the plebian hay rope and otherwise
made to feel chagrin, humiliation and the
iron hand of the conqueror.
SAN JOSE, March 22.â James W. Rea,
once the sole boss of> the Republican
party of this county, was hooted and
hissed at at a meeting of the Santa Clara
County Republican League this afternoon,
by the followers of John D. Mackenzie,
who a few years ago was an understudy
of Rea's. The meeting was one of the
most enthusiastic the league ever held
and, was attended, by 330 voters, nearly
all of whom were of the Mackenzie fac
tion. Rea and Dr. McGraw. the latter,
having recently developed reform pro
clivities, had attempted to hold a meeting
ot the County. Republican League ana
choose delegates to the State Convention
vi the Kepuolican League Club. McGraw,
who was president of the league, called
the meeting for this afternoon at 2
iVclock. He had passed the word around
among his friends to be present in force.
â¢ The Mackenzie clique got word of what
was eoins on and marshaled a force of
iÂ«ome- 350 followers, which comp.etely
routed McGraw and Rea.
When McGraw and Rea saw they had
been outflanked and were powerless in
the handsu of the - Mackenzieltes, they
wanted to adjourn the meeting for one
week. Rea appealed to the gathering to
let it go over, in the Interest of harmony.
This started a wrangle, in which Rea
found that he was alone, not a corporal s
guard of workers being leady to assist
State Senator Oneal led the^ opposition
to Rea. He objected to a postponement.
It was an Oneal" meeting and thei crowd
was with him. â¢ Â¦ 1\^
There were cheers for Oneal, but there
were nothing but hoots and ridicule for
Rea, who made a valiant fight against
big odds. The hissing was almost more
than Rea could stand, and once or twice
he seemed on the point of turning on the
crowd. Once he said he "did not propose
to be set down upon by men I have cre
atod," meaning Mackenzie, and then he
said he had done more for "Johnnie'
Mackenzie thanfor any one else.
It was decided to proceed with the elec
tion of officers. â¢ Louis Oneal was unani
mously elected president. McGraw at
once gave up the chair and beat a hasty
retreat from the hall. Allen Brant was
elected vice president, A. G. Bennett sec
retary and "VV. F. James treasurer.
L. W. Bond, Fred Cottle, H. L. Part
ridge, J. R. Bailey and R. J. Langford
were named as a committee to select del
egates to the Republican League Conven
tion.* , /'
The Republican Goodf Government
League at a largely attended meeting
this afternoon chose delegates to the Re
publican League Convention. Chairman
E. A. .Hayes reported that delegates
would bo elected on a membership ot
1404, and that 1000 associate members
would not be counted. Sixty-one dele
gates were elected,, with the same num
ber of alternates. Seventy-four new
members were taken in at to-day's meet

Sagging cheeks speak louder than
wordsâ they tell the tale no woman wants
to hear. Whether induced by care, Ill-
health or old age, they add from 30 to 40
years to any woman's appearance. Yet
nothing Is more easy to correct. I have
had many years of practical dally experi-
ence In correcting facial defects. By a
simple, painless operation I lift up tho
sagging cheek to its proper and natural
position. Perfect outline is given to un-
sightly, baggy chin and flabby throat.
Outstanding ears and deformed noies
made perfect. Absolutely painless and
without visible scar, as attested by my
own face, upon which three skin deep
cuts have been made to correct ill-shaped
nose and baggy eyelids. Consultation is
free either by letter or in person; strictly
confidential. During the last year I have
treated over 4000 ladles .of this city and

The training of animals has been a
study with Norris and Rowe for the last
eighteen years. The creatures go through
their acts willingly and seem to enjoy en
tertaining the public as much as the pub
lic enjoys being entertained. They enter
into their work with a vim' and daBh that
would do credit to reason-endowed crea
tures. Performances will be given every
afternoon and evening- at 2:15 and 8:15. up
to and including Easter Sunday, March
Ovi . . :
During the afternoon one
of the trained ponies was slightly cut
about the leg and the attendant doctored
the injured member with applications of
whisky. The operation was performed
near the chimpanzee's quarters, so close
In fact that he found it an easy trick to
reach the fiery liquid. Jim took advant
age of the opportunity and drank con
siderable of the fluid before being caught.
After a reprimand the four-footed actor
was left to repent and the incident waa
forgotten. In a few minutes, however,
Jim let the show people know that the
whisky had not served as a sleep pro
ducer. The brute had slipped his collar
and had caused no end of trouble by his
unwelcome visit to the quarters of the
other animals. Jim was captured In time
to do his turn at the evening perform
ance, but his debauch had left him a lit
tle groggy.

Ca&aAa. U, without question, one of the com
ing copper countriesâ in fact, it took eighth
rank as a producer In 1801. Not only this, but
tnÂ« percenUire of Increase was the largest Â«e
cured by any country making the metal ta
important quantities. British Columbia alone
maae nearly twice as much copper In 1901 as
Canada Has Future.
Bolivia has made copper In a email way for
many years, the Coro Cero mines being almost
the sole source of eupply. New companies have
beÂ«n organised In the past twelve months, and
new mines are to be exploited.
Austria-Hungary has a number â¢ of small
mines in Bohemia, the Tyrol and elsewhere. A
little Bosnian ore is included in the returns of
the dual empire, because smelted in Hungary.
Apparently nothing of much Importance in the
way of new mines is likely to be developed In
the near future.
Argentina has never been a considerable pro
ducer because of the inaccessibility of its best
copper fields. An English company was organ
ised late In 1901 for the purpose of developing
the Cerro de Caplllitas district, a field of much
promise. As it will be necessary to build a
railroad before opening and equipping thÂ« mines
Argentina cannot make much copper for several
years, but will eventually become a producer
of Importance, in all iiklihood, as It has prom
ises of copper bearing measures.
The comparative table for the years 1900 and
1S01 shows an Increase of 4.5 per cent in the in
crease of the United States production; a gain
of 20 Â»>er cent for the real of the world, and an
increase of 11.4 per cent in the production of the
entire world. This 1b a much larger increase,
both in the United States and in other coun
tries, than has been given In any previously
printed estimate of 1901 copper output, but In
the case of all other estimates yet printed the
figures' have been confined to those of the
United States and of all other countries lumped
together. The generally accepted estimate of
increased production in countries other than
the United States has been 12 per cent, but this
figure is too low. Nearly all of the principal
copper producing countries of the world, other
than the United States, made considerable gains
In 190L
Speaking of the copper mining industry
abroad the Western Mining World sup
plies some very interesting facts, which
are summarized as follows:
Years Are Compared.
In a review of the statistics supplied by
the Copper Handbook the Western Min
ing World says:
Long tonsâ 1S01 to 181Q. 91,000; 1811 to 1820.
9G,0Ut; 1821 to 1830. 135.000; 1831 to 1S40, 218,
000; 1841 to 1S50, 291.000: 1851 to 1860. 506.9U8;
lSCi to 1S70, 900,000; 1871 to 1&S0. 1.189,000;
1SS1 to lSJXt. 2,373,398; 1901 to 1900. 3.708,901:
total. 9,507,296.
The following table illustrates the re
markable growth of the copper mining
industry in a century:
Montanaâ 1900, 270,7S8.4S9 pounds: 1901.
248.000,000. Michiganâ 1900. 142,153,171; 1901.
170,800.000. Arizonaâ 1900. 118.317.764; 1901,
120.000.000.
An approximate estimate of the copper
output of the world during the year 1901
is made possible by the Copper Handbook
of \rhich advance sheets have been re
ceived. The grand total. Including the
United States, is figured out to have been
456,409 long tons, as compared with 54L
BU long tons for the year preceding. ThÂ«
United States in 1901 supplied of the total
output 2G9.111 tons and in 1900 produced
2&U1U. California in this summary is
credited with 28.611,225 pounds in 1900 and
25.000,000 pounds in 1901.' Montana. Mich
igan and Arizona make the great show-
Ing, of course, the figures being Â¦. tabu
lated as follows:
A list of the rare minerals for which
California Is famous has been prepared
by the State Mining Bureau, and the
showing is quite striking. California is
the only State producing lepidolite or
lithia mica, which is shipped to Ger
many for lithia salts. This is also the
only State in the Union mining the rare
mineral known as magnesite, and the
only one that produces chrome iron; the
only one that, produces platinum, lridium
and osmium in quantity. With the ex
ception of a portion of Nevada, next to
the California line, California is the only
producer of borax in the United States
and it is the source of tne main supply
of the country. Â¦ . : . â¢
One-fourth of the world's supply of
quicksilver comes from California. Then
again California holds the fourth position
as a producer of petroleum. It is the
only State that produces asphalt, and it
rivals Trinidad in this product. A great
gold State and' fast becoming: a crest

Apropos of the Investigations which the
State Mineralogist is making concerning
certain mining companies in this State is
the following singular statement In the
Mining and Scientific Press:
Stock In a mining company, which claims
to be doing something at some place not defi
nitely stated out in the desert in Riverside
County, Cal., Is being advertised In a pros
pectus that is a gem in the inducements it
offers to people to become stockholders. It
Btates that the stockholders are owners in a
lot of engines, boilers and other machinery, a
drug store, harness rooms, 160 acres of land,
of which forty acres are Inclosed with a barbed
wire fence and used as a pasture for the com
pany's mules, a cottage, bunk house, corral,
all buildings being- substantial and modern,
horses, mules, burros, stages and wagons, oil
lands, sandstone quarries, gypsum beds, iron
claims, many good roads and trails, a spring
of soft water, more than the mills can pos
sibly use, and five acres of a vegetable gar
den. It adds that the company has no sa
loons at the mines, does not allow liquor, beer,
gambling or dancÂ« houses on the grounds and
employs quiet and peaceable miners. Evi
dently the promoters think the Inducements
offered will sell the stock like hot cakes, else
they would have spoken of the mines that the
company proposes to work as at least an in
cident of the proposition. Of course there are
mines of some kind somewhere m the plans of
the company promoters, but the prospectus
Is silent concerning them. It does not say
whether they are gold, silver or somo other
metal. The "ore" is not referred to at all
nor Is there anv mention of prospective divi
dends. It Is possible, however, that the pro
moters are only trying to tell the truth. It
Is quite possible that they tre not sure about
having a mine, or that there will be dividends,
but are sure of the mules, the spring of soft
water and the five acres of vegetables.
A Queer Prospectus.
Australia is developing a large number of
new copper mines, located in nearly every
State of the commonwealth. A number of
these new mines are of more than average
promise, but many of the districts are ham
pered by inadequate transportation facilities.
The Great Cobar and Wallaroo and Moonta
remain the principal Australian mines. The
commonwealth should show a substantial gain
In production within the next two or three
years.
Chile made a considerable gain in produc
tion last year. Her maximum output was in
1876, when *2,S08 metric ton6 were produced,
this being nearly two-fifths of the world's out
put. Even as recently as twenty years ago
Chile, Spain and the United States made prac
tically the same output each. Since that time
Spain has doubled her output, the United
States has increased its production tenfold
and Chile has remained nearly stationary. The
largest and, in fact, the only important gain
ecored in many years was made in 1901, when
about 38,000 long tons were produced. A large
amount of new capital, mostly British, has
been placed in Chilean mines within the past
three years and the mines are being equipped
and operated on a more modern scale. It was
the neglect to employ modern methods and ma
chinery that caused the decline of Chilean
copper production during . the last quarter of
the last century.
the entire Dominion produced in 1900, increas
ing its production from 9,000,000 up to 80,000.
000 pounds. Important mines are being opened
in Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British
Columbia. The Cudbury field, in. the district
ef Algoma, province of Ontario, is developing
several new mines of promise. The old Bruce
mines, on Georgian Bay, have been reopened,
and now await the construction of a smelter,
and other Important mines are nearly ready
for production. Canada will make more cop
per In 1902 than the United States made in a
year so comparatively recent as 1S80.

"A revolution is taking place through
out the South in the use of fuel. Beau
mont oil Is generally supplanting coal for
power producing purposes. At Shreve
port. La., -compresses,. sawmills, cotton
seed oil mills and ginneries genera ly have
made the substitution of oil for coal. The
Shreveport Traction Company and the
Belt Line Company have just finished in
stalling plants for making the change. It
has been demonstrated that there is a
saving of at least 35 per cent in the cost
of fuel. The oil is brought to the fac
tory in its crude shape In tank cars, Just
as it comes from the gushers. ! It co-sts
1 2-3 cents per gallon, delivered," against
a cost of $3 25 per ton for good steam
coal. Other advantages in the use cf oil
are its cleanliness and the saving in the
wages of stokers. The oil is sprayed in
by machinery. The oil is a black green,
with a pungent odor."

a commercial point of view is that the
mineral is worth easily $400 per ton. . In It
is the coveted tungstate or tungstlc acid,
which has been found to be extremely
serviceable in the fabrication of armor

"At present there is a great cry of

There had to Ije an overproduction at'
first, else the possible great consumers
would not use it. The railroads would
never have changed their locomotives
from coal to oil burning had they not
been assured of an ample supply. The
great factories and iron works that are
now beginning to use oil would never
have done so if they had not become
convinced that they could get oil in suf
ficient quantities when and where they
wanted it. The ! steamship companies,
that will soon be using thousands of bar
rels daily, would never have entertained
the thought of using oil did not the pres
ent overproduction exist. , If oil producers
can only be patient and hold on for a few
months longer the oil business will be all
right, prices will advance, the drills will
be constantly pounding, the refineries will
be in full blast and from all sides will
come the cry, 'Give us oil!' "
The Pacific Oil Reporter says about the
outlook fo/ a greater demand for Cali
fornia fuel oil:
Reasons for Demand.
The announcement is made that the
Standard Oil Company is receiving sixty
miles of pipe each month for the line
from the Kern River lields to Point Rich
mond. The iron business in the East is
still driven with orders. The first lot of
pipe Is arriving in Installments and the
plans of the Standard Oil people look to
pushing the work of actual construction
as rapidly as is feasible under the circum
stances. Several months will necessarily
pass before the transportation of oil by
pipe to tidewater from Bakersfield is an
accomplished fact. The understanding
now Is that the pumping stations will be
somewhat , more than twenty-five miles
apart and that the pipe line will be divid
ed into ten sections. The Bakersfield Cal
if ornian of the 20th inst. reported that
ground had not then been broken In that
section for the construction of the line,
but that the. pipe that had arrived had
been distributed along the line. The line
will be buried in the ground and will be
covered with a coating of asbestos.

NEW YORK, March 22.â The statement of
the Associated Banks for the week ending to
-day shows:
Loans. $Â»12.0r.3,100: decrease; $7,777,000
Deposits. $973,234,600; dscrease, $11,15.1400

Surplus. $5,471,250; increase, $358 350
NEW YORK. March 22. â The Financier
says: The statement of " the New York as
sociated banks last week showed a ealn of
$.Â¦108,350 In surplus reserve, which, though
small, may be regarded as satisfactory from
the borrowers' standpoint. ! The surplus now
is $3,471,250.- or $6,801,175 below the amount
at the corresponding date last year whpn it
was $10,272,425. This loss In cash 'shown by
last week's statement was $2,425,500. This
considerably varies from - the sum which was
estimated from the traceable movements of
money during the week and the difference com
pared with the estimated amount was probablv
due to remittances to Bnston and Philadelphia
of gold certificates through the mall. The loans
were reduced $7,777,000, making $22.149 000 for
the fortnight ending with last week. This
comparatively sharp contraction of loans would
seem to Indicate "commendable conservatism on
the part of bank managers, in view of present
monetary conditions and those which will prob
ably result Irom the movement of, money to
the Interior for fnrmlnsr purposes which is
r.ow actively in progress. The deposits were
reduced $11,135,400. together with the reduction
cf 521,290,700 as shewn on March 15 makes
a decrease in th's Item of $32,432,100 durlue
the fortnight. The reduction in deposits last
week was $l>32,Â»00 larger than the total of' the
lots of cash and or- the decrease in loans
therefore the rtatement is slirhtlv out of har- :
mony. The reduction of $2,783,850 In resTve i
requirements resulted in the gain of $,1583. r ,6
in surplus, as above stated. It Is noteworthy
that in the corresponding week last year the
loans were only $2,174,000 less than those re- I
ported last week, while the deposits- were i
$27,233,700 and the total cash $13,607 100
Kreater. Five of the downtown banks last
week reported a total reduction of $0 600 000
In loans out of the $7,777;000 shown by all the
banks, and of these five one indicated a de- I
crease of <ib->ut $3,200,000. Seven of the larger
banks Fhowed a net gain or $600,000 in specie
The important losses In this item by two of
those banks were $5,000,000. one reporting S* -
200.000 and the other $2,800,000. .

stocks that are closely held at high prices by
I he class of holcers who keep aloof from the
stock Market apd pay little attention to the
price movements, but hold their shares tnrough
advances and declmes. Such movement* are
viewed with suspicion by experienced traders,
because they are easy to manipulate, owing
â¢o the sm/iH floating supply of the shares in
tbe market. This feeling is emphasized when
â¢ow-grade non-dividend payirg stocks, with no
Known prosiiect ol early dividends, share in the
movement, while the large mass of important
representative stocks are left neglected and'
sluggish. That has teen the state of affairs
in the stock market during the past week
The neglect of the standard stocks is. in
fact, accentuated by the erratic movenu-nts
o! thÂ«: less prominent stocks. It is very not- \
able, however, that while there is almost no I
demand tor stocks,, there is a marked disin- '
clfnation to sell, so that prices are remarkably ;
firm. The week's price-changes are mostly.
tains, although small ones. This firmness of j
undertone in the market is attributable va- '
ricusly to the confidence In the tuture prosper
ity if business conditions and to the fact that
tbe bulk of securities ar-j held by powerful
capitalists and syndicates aÂ« the proceeds of '
organizations and reorganizations, who have 1
adequate means to hold them and bide their
time for favorable opportunity to market them. !
The actual promise for the outcome of the !
year Is in the normal period of doubt and de- I
velopmcnt. This Is undoubtedly the real sea- i
con for the dullness and neglect of the stock ,
market, which is only varied In years of ex
traordinary conditions, such as those of last I
year. The critical period of the growth of
the country's great staple crops is always a
j period of hesitation and cautious speculation.
The outcome of the winter wheat crop is
looked to with "special interest this yeat. ow- !
Â¦ng to the shortcomings of last year's crop in
the winter wheat belt. The rains of last week I
in the Sjuthwest have been taken as a prom- 'Â¦
ite of a iavorablc outcome and have helped to i
keep the market tor stocks firm. The current |
returns of railroad earnings from that region
are showing the effects of last year's short
corn crop in the falling off ip traffic. Th- ob
f-tructicn to railroad traffic :n the Northwest
.'Â¦ v ,, 6 r' ow . Etonrl6 has been Partly offset by the
1-elief that the comln? crop there is favored
by the snow. The usual spring settlements of
I r-bor questions are a repcessive influence on
, speculation. They are brought into promi
' cÂ£ nce , b , y the convention of mine worke-* at
I Shamokin and the differences, with operators
, disclosed. The agreement with the textile
j workers in the New England mills was a help
| rul factor. The iron and steel outlook Is re
rarded as hlphly encouraging, although au
thorities In the trade have been inclined to
deprecate urgent buying for future delivery
and the difficulties of securing raw material
and transportation of finished products are
complained of. '. Â¦
Hut the condition of the money market alone

came in corn, provisions lost some of their
gains and closed only about steady, May pork

From the start oats ruled weak in sympathy
with wheat and corn. May closed weak, l%c

j CHICAGO, March 22.â There was nothing
but bear talk from start to finish In the wheat

t tion of , the rains in the Southwest and addi
tional showers fell West and Northwest. Ca
l bles also were weak and. turned weaker as the
day advanced. Receipts, both local .and North
western, were still small, but this influence;
! together with that of some fair early export
' trade, was lost sight of in the mad rush to
Â¦ Â¦ throw stuff overboard. I Bulls were nearly in a
panic. There was a general desire to sell both
â¢by the shorts and the longs. Trade was heavy
and at times very exciting. May opened %@
' r %c to %@%c lower, at 73c to 72%c. May
â¢ touched 7^%c after the early rush quieted
down. Shorts here began taking profits and
the market steadied, though there was still a
Â¦ marked bearish, feeling prevalent. Then -corn,
which was very weak to start, turned still
weaker, and May wheat, dropped to 71%c. May
continued very weak and closed 1%@1%c de

May since early in October. ! .

CALL BOARD SALES
The weekly Chicago letter of Bolton. De
Riryter &'Co. said:_ "The market was weak
from the start" Weather springlike through
out the West and complaints regarding grow
ing crop are not sufficient to lend much en
couragement. There was further general liq
uidation and the weakness in wheat was in
creased by the decline in corn. A large ex
port business is again reported from the-sea
board, although such an event is unusual on
Saturday. Â¦ The whole tone of the market is
extremely heavy. Small receipts and a large
export demand, seem to be unable to check the
decline. .At to-day's close we are about 14c
a bushel under Liverpool, two days ago at 13c
under we began to do a large export business.
The trade at moment, however, Â¦ is paying
but little attention to anything but what they
regard as favorable crop prospects. World's
shipments on Monday are likely to be large
and the decrease in the visible supply mod
erate."

Chicago dropped : from 73%c to 72c under fair

light. The cash demand was the only bullish
feature. About 116 loads were worked for ex
port on the- ' break. The weakness was ' en
hanced by Southwestern selling. St. Louis
plungers were reported getting short on tre
mendous Hne3 of wheat and corn.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The week closed on depressed markets for
Butter. Cheese and Eggs. The arrivals of
Butter have been too large during the past

another cut of about 2c in prices Is made quite
a shipping demand for the north will spring
up. Â¦ Spot stocks are heavy. Supplies of
Cheese are also very large.
Eggs are -accumulating again, and while
there is no decline the market rules weak, with
holders â¢ willing to make concessions to sell.
It was reported on the street yesterday that
those buyers who have been purchasing lib-'

reduced their bids l%c. bringing prices there

GOQD TEMPLARS' ORPHAN HOME, fji al-
. lejo. CaL, March 4. 1902.
Dr. G.S. Moore, 332 O'Farrell st.; San
Francisco â Dear Doctor: Please send three
bottles of your hair restorer. I have used
two bottles and I find It the best remedy 1 1
have ever used, and I think I have tried al-
most everything 1 have heard of and never
found anything that would stop it from fall-
ing. Your remedy 6topped It .from falling
and I am astonished to see how thick 'the
new hair is all over myhead with the two
bottles. I do not think I will need more than
the present order, but I shall try and keep
some on hand to clean my- scalp with. - My
head never felt to well as now. Yours truly, -
'. GEORGE BUNNER.

and faded hair. Send for circular. Prepara-'
tlons sent to alt parts of the world.' : ;

Ing and grow new hair. The Etar Hair Rem-
