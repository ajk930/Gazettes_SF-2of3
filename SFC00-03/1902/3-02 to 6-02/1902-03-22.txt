Miss Starrett before, his wife ', was burled, has. been a resident
of this city: for seven ; years. 'Carrel came here in straitened
.financtar. circumstances arid.- opened a harness and Â¦ saddlery

business; and .left' for,. San Francisco. Mrs. Carrel practfcally

. Carrel, is quite ; well to- do. He came to this city about six
months 'ago from \ Palo.'Alto, he was Â¦ a prosperous har

; But Miss < Starrett ; . struggled /hard and long, with her vow.
She.jhad'given'the .dying woman. her promise, but her naturo
rebelled, against carrying it out: And so, when the Rev. Dr.
Gardner of Palo Alto arrlved;at the homo of sorrow yesterday
he .was only askedt to perform one ceremonyâ that of 'offertng
up- the funeral prayers :for the repose of the soul of the dead.
After making, the 'preliminary, preparations, for the funeral,
Carrer visited- Cupid ,panforth's ofllce. He was wan and ner
vous'as he gave hls.liame and thatof his proposed bride. Bt^
people .are : . generally ' a/.trifle perturbed- when they go about
making their .preparations to' enter the, matrimonial sea, /and
"Cupid": did not become ; suspicious that he was giving a man
a license to/entefinto a ceremony, that, -had it been consum

matrimonial "knot;" ever tied" in this city. Carrel went away
and .made ; i further preparations for the wedding. lie went
to. the Jeweler's arid-bought aplaln gold' ring. With/the mar

The Ecssio^i of ; the I Cabinet , to-day ; was Â¦ almost exclusively'
devoted to consideration of thrTcase of . General Miles. Every

_had committed/a grave /breach "of /decorum.' It was deter

Miles is In grave danger of being retired/ by '- the
President.' .This action is not contemplated because
of his criticisms of; the President and Secretary, of
"^Var before the Senate Military Committee." but on
account ef the unfitness to occupy his high office, which the
edminiEtration asserts he has displayed. -It, is not proposed,
however, to immediately retire General Miles. His past^record
eatisfles the President that ; he/ will, be unable. to' stay inside
the bounds of discipline, and another Impropriety will be fol
lowed by the fall of the ax. !"â¢ .'
The view taken by friends of the President and '; the - Sec
retary of War is that nothing General Miles .-said -before the
Military Committee should lay him'urider official censure. .The
Impression is apparently deeply, rooted/ that- the; lieutenant
eetKrz\ of the army Is "playing politics."; and : . that to retire
him as a result or his testimony would, be to make "a martyr
of him, or. at least, arouse sympathy for him throughout the
country. ' : . â¢ . Â¦ ; - â¢ '."Â¦ - l -. - -Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦
"General Miles." Eaid a prominent official to-day, '/has Jong
been a candidate for the Presidency. He desires to be an anti-
afiministration and Democratic candidate. * This was true of
his ambitions just after the Spanish war while McKinley was
President, and It is true now.
"Continuously since President Roosevelt entered the White
House the lieutenant general has been contrary to the wishes
cf the President, who is his commander-in-chlcf, and -to the
policy cf the Secretary of War, and constantly catering to tho
Democratic and anti-administration element. ' '
"General Miles, in his annual report, came out fairly and
BQuarely against the canteen, against â¢ the department and
against the President. In this way he won a 'great deal* of
applause from the church people and was commended In all
of the church newspapers. Yet at the time General - Miles
wrote his report the canteen question, had be|Â» settled. A
paragraph abolishing it had been inserted in the army reor
ganization bill last winter. â¢
FIGURES IN SCHLET CONTROVERSY.
"General Miles next. figured in the Schley controversy.
When the court of inquiry rendered its decision he gave an
interview criticising thÂ© court and upholding Schley. For this
he was reprimanded by the Secretary of War, and his friends
endeavored to make it appear that he had been abused and
humiliated.
"Then came the army beard, which was convened for the
purpose of selecting sites for army posts where troops are to
be quartered when not in active service In the fie'.d. He Issued
a statement in which he disagreed with the majority of the
board, declaring it was against public policy that army posts
Bhould be located near large cities, because troops may be used
for shooting down Tvorkingmen/; ; No thinking man would for
a moment take the view that United States troops would ever

dividends of 2 per cent each consecutively
and which he said he was willing to guar

this city, to-day was again the scene of
an accident, which, while ft entailed no
loss of life, caused a property loss of con
siderable proportions. The brownstonÂ«
fronts of several four-story private houses
on the east side of the avenue sank be
cause of undermining of foundations by
excavations for the rapid transit tunnel.
The first serious cave-in occurred when
the sidewalk and area way of 55 Park
avenue sank to a considerable depth,
leaving the front wall with no support
and .exposing the cellar. The houses on
either side of No. 55. were also rendered
unsafe. Later in the afternoon, there oc
curred a further settling- of the walls and

LONDON, March 21. -At a meeting. of
the Edinburgh Association of. Retail To
bacconists to-day a resolution was adopt
ed unanimously declining to sign the
Imperial Tobacco Company's .agreement
not to sell American goods for a term of
years, and expressing willingness if -the
minimum price is raised so as to allow a
fair profit to dealers, to do what is pos
sible, bonus or no bonuH, for the eale of
British goods. The chairman declared
that no one outside of a lunatic asylum
would sigrn such an agreement, which
would make them the servants Of the Im
perial . Tobacco Company. While the
Americans offered a large bonus, no. re
strictions were placed on the dealers.
The Belfast Tobacco dealers at a meet
ing to-day decided to accept the Ameri
cjui proposition.
The London. tobacconists at a big meet
ing, held this afternoon: to consider "the
rival bonus schemes, after a long discus
sion passed, a' resolution unantmously'ab-'
soluteiy refusing to sign the Imperial To
bacco Company's * agreement as being
"unjust and unfair to the traders." "
The retailers were' ndf content with re
jecting the proposed boycott of American
tobacco, but went a step further, passing
a resolution to support any manufactur
ers willing, to guarantee," on proprietary
articles, a minimum profit to the. retail-'
er of '20 per cent on tobaccos to 25 per cent
on cigarettes.* The speakers bitterly ue
nounced the British combine, declared the
latter had "out-Americanized; the: Ameri
ca ns,"< and." said that its .recent; action
wouldonly result in forcing the remaining
independent tobacco I concerns in ing-land
into the arms, of the Americans. '
The resolutions were adopted w'th much

Rabbi Nieto lectured last evening at the'
Post-street synagogue on. the subject of
biblical criticism and religion. The trend
of his address was to' contradict the
statement that biblical criticism was de
structive to religion.' He said that the
Bible had ever been open . to interpreta
tion, and textual changes were only in
the nature of criticisms. The rabbi de
clared that no matter Â¦ what criticisms
might be made the Bible would. never be
lowered nor its> standards of truth and
morality shaken. He concluded by, saying
that the effect "of criticism ofithe Bibio
would be to convince people of the'neces
slty of rellgicji' without appeal, to blind
faith and emotion.
"Napoleon realized that the empire was
but a makeshift and he realized. that the
.time must come for more liberal ideas:
He passed away like a meteor; groat
iu death.: yet disappointed. After
Waterloo he surrendered and died' six
years afterward, chained to the rock of
St. Helena, one of the most remarkable
characters of the world, one of the most
loved and despised and one of the great
est- enigmas of ; the world; When France
shall forget that she ever bent the knee
to kings or emperors the name of Napo
leon will be revered and the history of
the future will say- of him that he if ought

dom." - Â¦ . . Â¦Â¦.._Â¦'. -.- -.-..-
- "Me was not a child of circumstances;
he was au expression of the failure of the
French republic. He was the most re
markable military genius the world ever
kntw. He made generals of mechanics
and the . bravest soldiers . out of â¢ plow
men. ' He dealt with the diplomats of
Europe as if they were children and every
court in Europe conspired to defeat - the
French republic. The world made of Na
poleon the greatest soldier ' of all ' tlmes. :
Despite ,fais pomp and egotism he was a
democrat at heart and would have fought
for the liberties of the people had he
lived. He shqwed thlg when hesald: 'I
must defend my autocratic poeition, but
my son must be a liberal or he will not
be able to preserve the nation.'
Rabbi Voorsanger then told of the early
life of Napoleon. and of his rise to power;
how he overran Europe' w:th his troops
and upset thro*nes, making his relatives
Kings and queens.
"What made such a remarkable person
ality possible," said che speaKer, "was
trie incapacity of France to govern itseifi
Napoteon was the outcome of a-mhstaken
democracy, 'ilie menof.the reign of ter
ror were the tyrants of liberty, and in the
terrible excitement of the times the young
Corsican came to the front." ' -
Continuing, Rabbi Vdorsanger 'said:
"History is not a record of nations, kings
or queens, but of the motives of human
ity. 'The history of the world is the judg
ment of- the world/ declared Goethe, .and
history cannot be written by one's con
temporaries.',' .
In speaking of the life of Napoleon
Habbi Voorsar.ger said that no truthful
history of the French military genius had
been written. His admirers looked- upon
him as a demi-god. while his enemies de
clared he. was a devil. No truthful history
could be written while love and "hatred
existed, ' declared Kabbl Voorsanger, and
it would remain for future writers to give
the world an unbiased account of the life
of Nayoleon. '
"Napoleon the Great" was . the subject
of the lecture delivered last evening by
Rabbi Voorsanger at Temple Emanu-J21
before a large audience that included
many persons not of. the Jewish faith.

power cieatea by that dam, to allow the
construction t of : mlet and outlet canals,
etc.<;.Kichardson*s ; amendment - met witn
no' opposition -yesterday. Gaines'- amend
ment, to; the .amendment provided ..that
lease or grant of this* water power should
be. to the ..highest bidder. He declared
that the 1 right proposed to be given away
was a very valuable: one. -- cjii
Richardson ; th'en explained his connec
tion with ; the original amendment,' in
which he sald>he' had no personal inter
est.. Last summer at the request of some
constituents of his who desired to obtain
the privilege of. using the water power, at.
Nashville, he and Senator Carmack came
to Washington Â¦ to: see the. Secretary â¢; of
AVar about. the- matter. The secretary, he
said,' declined to grant- the request for the
use of : the water, saying it was a. matter
which Congress should pass on. -There
the matter rested until a short time ago.
Richardson said, : when his constituents
asked him to call the matter^to the atten
tion of Congress and -he had done so. "I
had no further. interest in the matter, 11 
said he, "than to do my duty by my con
stituents who had asked me to come here
and who had- paid my way."
Gaines Insisted that the rights to be
given away under his -colleague's amend
ment were exceedingly valuable. He said
that a N.ew York-concern had offered
$899,000 for similar rights at Chattanooga.
At the War Department he said it was
estimated that the water riphts at Nash
ville were worth, several million dollars.
By this time members on both sides of
the House were much interested, and
Burton, .chairman .-t of the . committee,
seemed iiot adverse to seeing the two
Tennessee members fight out their differ
ences, but Gaines denied that there was a
difference. -' -Â¦: .

,. The two women' have retained .Cramer
B. Morris: of this- j city' to .bring suit
against their, husbands to compel them
to s pay alimony, and ; they ; announce that
after the expiration of a year they will
sue for a divorce, alleging desertion.
Â¦Soon after that, she declares, 'he began
to Importune her to transfer her property
to him,- and as a ruse she explained that
the major part of the Patton estate had
been bequeathed to her daughter. On
learning this, his - wife alleges that I he
began; to lay his plans "for the marriage
of his son, a young man 20 years old.: to
the girl; and six months ago the, mar
riage was solemnized. â¢
After that, Mrs. .Nowlin says, both men
conspired to get control of. the estate.
Both ; women claim .-that < they soon
realized the trend of affairs and from then
on her, husband and his son, George Lee
Nowlin. made. life unbearable for her and
her daughter. A week ago things came
to a climax and Nowlin -Sr. < packed his
trunks and left for parts unknown. . Mrs.
Nowlin says that he put numerous arti
cles In his trunk that do not belong to
him. The day following his departure Mrs.
Nowlin received a letter from him, saying
he would never return, and upon the re
ceipt df this letter Nowlin Jr. packed his
trunk and left without, his. young- wife.
He wrote.: to his wife from -Los Angeles,
saying, he had been called, away by the
serious illness of. his mother. ; j
To-day â¢ the two . women called '-at i the
District Attorney's office and sought to
have -warrants Issued for the men. Mrs:
Nowlin Sr. ,, is the widow T of
John Patton, one- of the i wealth
iest of; this valley." She
claims that' in: 1895 : she met Nowlin; who
pretended '-to own considerable | property
in San Francisco. He used these preten
sions, to further his suit,: she says, for he
early' declared .his love for her.
she capitulated and, the two were mar
ried. . Â¦Â¦. Â¦â¢Â¦ i Â«â¢â¢Â¦.-; - â¢ . â¢-
SAN BERNARDINO, March 21.â Two
"women, a 1 , mother ..and daughter, "> 'have
been deserted by their respective .hus
bands, | who are J father and son," and now
both have' made complaint' to the District
Attorney that .the i men . have decamped,
taking, with Â¦ them ? money "and valuables
to which, they have no claim. The story
told by the elder woman, Mrs. Samuel S.
Nowlin, Is a remarkable one and threat
ens to involve the' husband' In criminal
proceedings.' . Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦
Â¦ Special fclspatch to The Call.
The woman had gone Into her garden to
drive out a flock of chickens and was im
mediately attacked by the rooster, which
succeeded in knocking her down. Though
she fought It desperately it managed to
sink its beak into her face a number of
times, aiming to strike out her eyes.
Her screams brought a neighbor, who in
turn was attacked, and ignoring a heavy
club the shanghai routed Hoth women.
Mrs. King's hands were terribly lacerat
ed. Her arms began to swell and now
her face and the left side ot her body
are inflamed and .doubted In size. The
statement is made to-night " that blood
poisoning has set in and - serious results
are not Improbable.
â¢ The rooster has been notorious here for
its dangerous disposition and has been
a terror to children in the neighborhood
for a number of . months. . One of the pe
culiar features of the case is that al
though Mrs. King realizes her critical
condition she refuses to allow the shang
hai to be killed. ; .
SAN BERNARDINO, March 21.â Mrs.
M. E. King, the keeper of. a lodglng-housa
here had a mix-up, with . -an enraged
shanghai rooster this morning which bid3
fair to result in decidedly serious conse

A bald-headed man is always telling you
how ho had'a fever, and lost his hair.
i The lumbermen show that this arbitrary
action of the southern lines will jeopar
dize 40 per cent of shingle and 16 per cent
of lumber shipments of the State. It thus
hits a body blow to the greatest industry
in the State, which is largely controlled
by owners of mills residing in California
A vigorous protest against the change
is being prepared by the Pacific Coast
Lumber -Manufacturers' Association and
the Washington Red Cedar Shingle Asso
ciation, which organization represents an
Invested capital exceeding 525,000,000 Pro
tests will be presented to the Northern
Pacific and l Great Northern railways
which get the? longest part of the haul.
These roads say that they are inno
wise responsible, for the changing of rates
on ADril.l.: . :
Heretofpre these Hne8 have participated
in giving through rates. Lumbermen here
say that the change is made in the.inter
ests of the lumber interests of Texas an<l
Arkansas.: The region affected comprises

It Was the number of safe hits secured off

. The measurements of the Challenger ara
as follows: Length over all, 42 feet 4>i
inches: length on the water line, 28 feet;
extreme beam, 10 feet 2V3 inches; draught.
6 feet 6 inches; sail area, 1004 square feet;
racing length, 30 feet. As the yacht de
fending the cup must not exceed the
challenger by more than 10 per cent, the
Corinthian craft may not be more than
thirty-three feet in raeing length. It has
been generally supposed .that Frank
Stone's Presto would be selected to de
fend the trophy, she 'Â¦having a racing
length of 28.34 feet. It Is usually consid
ered better to give a time allowance than
to receive one, so the Corinthians " may
decide to defend with- a larger boat rather
than with a smaller one. In that case
Sharp and. Toepke's Harpoon would bo
the boat selected-. In the last lnterclub
annual regatta the Harpoon had a racing
length of 36.10 feet and raced with the 44
footers, but it is believed It would- not be
difficult to cut her down to bring her
within the limit of thirty-three feet. .1 The
Harpoon is a faster boat than the Presto,
as is shown by -the times made in> races
in which both yachts have sailed. "^Ia the
Decoration day annual Corinthian regatta
last year the Harpoon's sailing time was
2 hours. 11 minute3 48 seconds, and Pres
to' 3 time was 2 hours 18 minutes 4 sec
onds. In the annual interclub regatta, on
September 9 of last year, Harpoon's time
was 2 hours 23 minutes 9 seconds, and
Presto's was 2 hours 25 minutes 6 seconds.
The results of these two races show that
while Harpoon on account of her greater
length is faster, boat for.boat, than Pres-i
to. she cculd not give Presto the time al
lowance of 10 minutes 51 seconds to which
Stone's boat would be entitled over a
fourteen-mile course. If Harpoon were
cut down to a racing length of thirty
three feet she would still have to allow
seven minutes, which would have landed
Presto a winner by a narrow margin on
Decoration day and by an ample one in
the Admission day regatta.
To-morrow morning at about noon the
bridge leading to the Tlburon lagoon will
be raised, and the yachts and arks which
have been laid up there during the winter
will be towed out to their summer moor
jÂ£f 9 'n the cove. It will be high water at
Tiburon shortly before 12 o'clock. The

The San Francisco's have lost little time
in sending: in their challenge. The new
boat took her first cruise last Sunday
from Sausalito. and on Tuesday Secretary
W. M. Edgell mailed the challenge for the
Perpetual cup to Secretary J. C. Brickell
of the Corinthian Yacht Club. The race
must be sailed not earlier than thirty
days nor later than sixty days after the
receipt of the challenge, and between
May 1 and September 30. Yesterday after
noon the directors of the Corinthian
Yacht Club met in Secretary J. C. Brick

- In the second. round Erne stabbed Gard

then^fought him all over with : similar
blows. Gardner countered three times,
reaching the ear, the chest and the jaw.
All the blows were light. Erne put two
lefts to Gardner's jaw as the xound
closed,- the second -blow- being a vicious
one that shook Gardner badly. * '
The third round was a repetition of tha
first and second. . Erne put In his left tlma
and again,, blocking all of Gardner's
counters. Gardner went to his corner
badly used up. the blood pouring in a
stream from his nose.
The" fourth' and lifth rounds were a bit
livelier. Gardner attempted at times to
counter, but with poor success.
._Iu the Ia3t round Gardner was staggered
with a left on the jaw as soon as he left
his corner. Erne shot them in hard and
fast and Gardner backed around the ring,
trying to protect himself. Roused by tiÂ»&
yells of the crowd; he made a brief stand,
sending his left to Erne's jaw, his right to
the ribs. A second later he caught Erne
on the back of. the heat" -with a right
hook, when Erne jabbed his nose with a
straight left.. For the rest of the round
he did nothing but take left punches in
the face.- â â¢ - - - Â¦ Â¦ â¢ \- .-
In the first, round Erne, after feinting
GardnÂ«r into helpless bewilderment, land
ed his left on the nose. Gardner clinched
and slapped Erne over the kidneys, hi3
only blow during the round. Erne put
four straight lefts to the mouth without
a return. He pounded Gardner's â¢ nose
twice and then put two more hot ones on
the mouth, bringing blood. Gardner
backed around the ring with a frightened
look on his face and Erne kept close up,
putting in his left to the mouth and nose
whenever-he- stretched it out.
On the strength of his recent victory
over George McFadden. Gardner was
thought to have a good chance with Erne,
but he put up a very poor fight. He waa
throughout on the defensive, and it waa
a decidedly Inferior defense at that. Dur
lngthe first five rounds Gardner did not
average a lead to a round, depending en
tirely on counters, which Erne blocked
almost invariably. In the, last, round
Gardner, spurred to action by the hoots of
the crowd, started in to fight, and Erne
promptly battered him all around the
ring. Gardener then went back to his oid
defensive tactics.

OVER a track inclined to be cuppy
no fault could be found with the
performances of favorites at
Oakland track yesterday. Five
straight marched past the wire
first and the ring received a severe
scorching. The attendance was large and
all partook of the love" feast, if the tales
of woe related by the pencilers could be
believed.
Birkennith, on Yrsula, favorite for the
opening maiden event, beat the bairier
nearly half a doien lengths, winning off
by himself. Flitting, a 30 to 1 shot, rid
den by "Jess" Matthews, nosed out
Knockings tor the place. El Pilar, George
Whitney and Axminster were . all well
backed. â¢ - â¢ ,
A small field of six started in the half
mile dash for two-year-olds, with Nigrette
ruling an 11 to 20 favorite. Larry Daly
had the leg . up and after getting away
from the. post none too well, downed Es
carola a length. In the betting the latter
filly's odds were forced down from 25 to
12, and Â«he narrowly escaped landing.
Tom Mitchell was third. , ' \
At last, after more trials and tribula
tions than were encountered by Henry M.
Stanley in "Darkest Africa," '.'Jim" .Neil
finally won a race with Lento. The colt
went to the post a 7 to 5 favorite for the
first mile ana fifty yard run, and through
Jackson's clever riding beat Harry
Thatcher two lengths. Windward ran
Rubus, from the Chlnn & Forsythe
stable, apparently possessed the speed of
the starters in the fourth event and was
rightfully installed a 4 to 5 favorite.
"Longshot" Conley rode a perfectly rated
race on the filly, taking the lead In the
stretch and running In two lengths before
Rubino, a 12 to 1 chance. E. M. Brattaln,
a well played one. ran third. -
Andy Blakeley's useful -, mare", Lady
Meddlesome, made tt^four straight by
capturing the second mile and fifty yard
run. She made all the running and then
won â¢ easily from Limelight. Grand
frp.chem finished third.
The concluding Futurity course sprint
â¢-^suited inCa dump for Lhe talent. Mal
iaitwa a 15 to I chance backed down to
7 disposed of Skip Me, a 100 to 1 shot, by
a' length. Valencienne, the favorite, made
a -poor showing and Canderos also per
formed badly, l
AL NEILL. knocked out the redoubt
able "Rube" Ferns of Kansas last
night In Woodward's' Pavilion in
the twelfth round; of. one of. the
most sensational fights ever seen here.
Ferns shared honors with Jack. O'Brien
in the matter of taking punishment.- It
seemed impossible for flesh and blood to
withstand the buffeting those two boxers
did. Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦... ..' '
Xeill did not escape unhurt, as he had a
big discoloration just over his kidneys,
caused by the frequent . visitation of
Ferns' glove. The, Calif ornlan won.be-.
cause he could think quicker than could
his opponent and. was by. far the'cleverer
boxer. Both were in splendid condition,
but Xeill was said to have a decided pull
iri^the weights, although he did not look
heavier than his stocky opponent. Ferns'
recuperative powers were the marvel of
the spectators., . . â¢
The attendance was the largest ever
seen in Woodward's Pavilion, there being
barely standing room In -any part of thp
house. It was the, first professional tour
nament of the Hayes -Valley Athletic
Club, and the spectators had more than
a run for their money. -. .
The blow which sent Ferns to his knees
and to defeat in the twelfth round was a
right-hand uppercut on the chin. A mo
ment before just such a blow landed and
dazed the Kansas man. Nelll/Vas perfect
ly cool and poised himself for the decisive
blow. It landed on the vulnerable point
and Ferns dropped -to his- hands and
knees. He groped about aimlessly while
Referee Ed Smith counted* eight. His
seconds then rushed into the ring and car
ritd him to his corner. There were cheers
-for the victor, and then more cheers for
the vanquished. Certainly no gamer man
and no harder fighter ever entered a rine.

He started well, sending a shower of 1
blows at Neill. who blocked them all with
his gloves. Neill sent his right across to*
the Jaw and missed a left. In a slugging,
match both went down. Ferns got the
worst of the mix-up and was knocked
down with a right to the Jaw. He stayed
oown eight seconds.- No sooner- was- he
on his feet than, he was again knocked
flat on his back with a straight right.
He stayed down eight seconds and the
gong saved him from being counted out.
His seconds worked hard over Ferns
during the, minute rest 'and he made a
wonderful showing In the sixth round
Neill went In to finish him and tried for
a right cross. Ferns fought him back.

PERSONAL' MENTidtV.
With the exception of New York, th!*
chronological exhibition of color print*.
given by the Bohemian Club, will be one
of the. most Important ever held In tha
United States*. â¢*- .. .,â¢ v ...
Sunday afternoon the committee will be
gin to convert the famous jinks room into
a veritable Japanese garden.
An additional treat will be offered in
the decorative effects, which, under tho
efficient direction of Arthur F. Mathews,
will be carried out in artistic arrangement
of cherry blossoms and green bamboo,
together with great bronze Buddhas and
novel lantern effects.
In the very earliest period ' of block
printing only three colors "were used;
these colors of vegetable matter wer9
compounded by each artist for himself.
.Yet these prints to-day, after two centu
ries, present a unity and purity of tone
absolutely unrivaled. In the seventeenth
century, a greater variety Â¦ of color was
brought Into use. sometimes as many as
five, and the Japanese treatment of this
new acquisition has been likened to tho
grammar of color arrangement, and is
said to outrival even the best Greek dec
oration. ',
There Is noticeable in each stroke a
master touch, "evidence that the artist
had the exact knowledge of what to do
to obtain the simplest yet the most subtle
effects, not only in the quality of line en
graving, but in the superposition' of color
value.
Master Touch Evident.
The best authority on *tb.e subject 1 "*^
serts that the old -'Japanese prrnts/ at
their best, are by* all odds 'the greatest
specimens of the art of designing and ex
ecuting that the world has ever seen.
So rich are these early examples In pri
mary art principles that throughout Eu
rope, and America as well, the schools of
design and schools of painting- secure
them as Invaluable models to the stu
dents. ' "; ; /" ; Â»Â¦-. '-''.'â¢ â¢
Art lovers long ago learned to "appreci
ate the graceful flow of line and harmony
of tone that make these pictures of early
Japan worthy of close study and a source
of gratification to every esthetic sense. To
many who have had no opportunity of
studying the work of.Hokusal or Korlu
sal the prints will be a revelation. There
is a delicate sweep, an exquisite color, a
wonderful effect gained by so little ap
parent effort.
Many of the prints for the exhibition
will be selected from these two collec
tions; others of value will be loaned from
the collections of Arnold Genthe. Porter

A few days' serious rivalry to the Hop
kins mid-spring exhibition la -threatened
by the Bohemian Club's innovation in the
way of an exhibition of rare old Japanese
color prints, which will be held in the
Jinks room, opening Monday, March 24, to
be continued three days. Â¦
The exhibition, which promises a treat
to the genuine art lovers of San Francis
co, is the first of the kind to be held on
the Pacific Coast, and is, therefore,
looked forward to with. unusual interest.
While foreigners, particularly of ParhÂ»
and London, have for years been studying
and collecting with enthusiastic zeal these
rare old examples of Japanese art. of. .the
early period, alert America 1 has also been
alive to their- value and has : quietly
worked away, with the result : that with
the exception of Paris, where, it Is said,
some of the private collections contain
over 10,000 -prints, some of the rarest ex
amples are to be found In this country.
â¢ To the "Boston Museum of Fine Arts can
he traced an exact affiliation and chronol
ogy of each phase of the famous Ukloye.
The world's first complete exhibition of
Ukloye painting and prints, many speci
mens of which have subsequently found
their way to the private collections in this
city, was held in New, York in 1S95.
To the enthusiasm of two of the most
zealous collectors on the coast, Edgar A.
Mathews and William Dallam Armes, tho
members and friends of the Bohemian
Club are* indebted for the pleasure., of
viewing for the first time many original
prints from the various periods, dating as
far back as the fifteenth century and em
bracing such names as Hokusai-Haruno
bu, Koriusal Masanobu, and many other
of Japan's most famous artists.

T.HE London Express publishes the first correct drawing of the Kins as he
will appear' in his coronation robes at Westminster in June next.
. Briefly, it may be said that according to the present Intentions the
outer robe' will be of purple velvet embroidered with the , various badges
. 'Â¦ Â¦' . in gold; the skirt will be of the finest white silk, as well as the stock-
Ings, while the .shoes, will also be white, with gold badges wrought on them.
-Perhaps. the most truly resplendent and regal part of his Majesty's corona
tion robes _ will be the pallium, or royal mantle, which is now, being woven of
cloth of gold on the looms of Bralntree,: in Essex. â'" ..'.": .
' Cloth of gold has Invariably been, the material ;used for2 : the -royaU\maniI_e at
all coronations. - . Â¦
But, as in things of lesser value, there are. cloths of .gold and clothspof gold,
and even that which King Edward will wear wllldlffer considerably In .the. text
ure of the weaving from that prepared for the late Queen's crowning: '
Unlike the palliums of previous. sovereigns the cloth of gold of which King
Edward's will be made will be devoid of the usual "designs of shamrock, thistles,
roses and eagles.
When -completed, however, the pallium .will not be without design, for the
ornamentation will be done by the Royal School; of Art Needlework, the em
broidery being executed in gold and silver thread- in -correct heraldic coloring,
the design being bold and large. . .
Thus the weavers have had considerable difficulties to contend with, for not'
only have they had to study to get a brightness of surface combined with a sup
pleness of texture, but they have also had to produce a material adaptable to the
embroiderer's needle. Â¦
' Special', gold thread, of course, Is used, the woof twist composed of two fiat
and one round Btrand of extraordinary fineness, being faced with a most beau
tiful sheen, " . .
Some Idea of the remarkably fine quality of the material employed may be
had from the fact that the metal used contains less alloy than the British gold
coinage. 1 'Â¦--Â¦-'Â¦.
, . Yet the material that has so far been made Is so soft and pliant that it rea
lly falls into the most perfect folds.
It is learned on the highest authority that the King Is very partial to the
Gothic crown, similar to the one worn by, Henry VIII.
This crown is of a particularly plain design, consisting of four Gothic arches
surmounted on the top by a .St. George's cross.
The crowns of the British kln^s have varied ; considerably in the- matter of
design. For instance, in the; twelfth and thirteenth centuries the royal crown of
England was a Jeweled circlet of gold, heightened with strawberry leaves or tre
foils, Bometlnies alternately large arid small.
Henry IVs crown was as costly as it was magnificent, the eight strawberry
leaves being alternated with as many fleur-de-lis, the whole alternating with
sixteen small groups of pearls. . Â¦ ._â¢ . ?_ â¢

COMPLICATING AN ISSUE.
FOR ;a long time a considerable proportion of
the people of the United States have desired ari
amendment to the constitution providing for
the election of Senator by direct popular vote. At
the present time it is highly probable the desire is en
tertained by a strong majority of voters. A resolu
tion in its favor has been passed by~ an overwhelming
vote in the House, and there is >a strong sup
port for it in the Senate. Just at this juncture, how
ever, when .everything promises well for the meas
ure, Senator Penrose introduces a resolution which
adds to the original amendment a scheme of change
so great that there is not the slightest probability it
The Penrose resolution proposes that the Senate
of the United States shall be composed of atrleast
two Senators from eachState and an additional Sen
ator for every ratio of 500,000 persons, all. of whom
shall be elected by direct vote of- the people thereof
for a term of six years, and each Senator shall have
one vote. It provides, further, that a plurality . of
votes shall elect; that vacancies occurring s/iall be
filled, not, as now, by temporary executive appoint
ment; but by; new elections, as vacancies in, the
House of Representatives are filled, and that, after
each decennial csnsus, the number of Senators, for
each State shall- be "fixed and apportioned," as the
number of . Representatives ,in the other branch is, ex
cept that each State shall have at least two.
The plan, if adopted,' would put an end to the
equality of the States so far as representation in the
Senate is concerned, and that is about the only place
where they have equality. New York, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Ohio and other populous States would gain
power injthc Senate as fhey now have in the House,
and the last vestige of the old States rights prin-
a MONG the bosses and the henchmen who are
l\ expected to attend a banquet in San Jose in
Â¦*Â¦ V celebration of the appointment of the no
iiotorious "Johnny" Mackenzie to the office of Har
â¢bor Commissioner is John C. Lynch, who holds the
Federal office of Collector of Internal Revenue.
The association of this official with the gang that is
now working for the re-election of Gage and the
continuance of the domination of Herrin will sur
prise no one who has given any attention to the
career of L^nch ever since he entered office. In
fact, there would have been surprise had Lynch been
Emitted when the invitations went out to Kelly,
Burns, Crimmins, Herrin and the rest of the gang.
President Cleveland in condemning the continual
interference of Federal office-holders with politics
referred to it as "t>zraic\o\ii activity," and the phrase
has retained a place in public favor to this day.
Such : activity is indeed pernicious. It leads to the
neglect of official duty, the shirking of rightful work,
the offensive use of Federal patronage in the inters,
ests of factions and bosses and the degradation of
the Federal service. A worse example of the evils
of this sort of pernicious activity could not be found
than is paraded before the people of California by
John C. Lynch. He has been an active henchman
of the worst bosses of the city and the State ever
since he took possession of* the office, and has given
fur more of his energy and his time to serving Her
rin than to serving the Government from which he
draws his salary.
The part which Lynch played as a partner of Her
rin, Kelly, Crirnmins. Burke and the rest dur
ing the late city election *. is well known. He
is now training with the same gang in State
politics. His appearance at the* 1 banquet in cele
bration of the triumph of the San Jose boss
will be in harmony with his whole official
record. In fact, it is to be doubted jf he was ever
in his office attending to his official duties when the
bosses wished him to be engaged at their work.
Federal office and Federal patronage ! are nothing
more to him than a means of doing henchman poli
tics in the service of Herrin.
So offensive has Lynch made himself to the people
of California that his removal from office has become
a matter of great importance to the Republican party.
So long as a Republican administration keeps him
in office, so long will the administration be to some
extent discredited in California. . President Roose
velt has a high reputation for upholding the dignity
of the civil service in all its departments and in all its
branches. He has firmly enforced the rule that Fed
eral officials must attend to their duties,- and if he
now tolerates Lynch it must be solely because he has'
not 3'et been made aware of the course Lynch has
pursued ever since he took office. Lynch is, in fact,'
an offensive partisan oC the worst kind. At4he Mac
kenzie banquet he will be in his element, but in the
Internal Revenue office he is out of place. His re
moval should be urged at once -upon' the President
by every member of the California delegation in
Congress. -,,../ .-.Â¦->
What would be the immediate effect were the Lib
erals in Parliament, to. accept Rosebery's leadership
we cannot undertake to sa3% but the ultimate" result
of.it can hardly be a matter of doubt. In a free "coun
try' ho partycan live that undertakes to evade a vital
issue, and to the British empire the Irish question
is very/, vital indeed, nor was it ever more urgent
than now. > '
Such being the situation, it is that the re
lations between the Irish and' tie British members
of Parliament are strained and unnatural. That feel
ing must be taken into consideration in estimating
the passion that impelled Dillon to his violent de
nunciation of Chamberlain. It must also be counted
on in weighing the chances of Rosebery in his ef
forts to organize the Liberal party in support of a
platform excluding the Irish question. -
.. All parties seem to be agreed that at this time^ de
spite the comparative quiet of the Irish people, the
condition of Ireland is utterly unsatisfactory. The
land question appears to be the center of strife. The
tenants complain of injustice and the landlords com
plain of spoliation. The long series of land acts en
acted by Parliament have settled nothing. At the
present time not only are the Nationalists of Ireland
hostile to the Ministry, ' but the Irish j Unionists are
hardly less so. All parties of Irish, in fact, are
united in the movement for a redress of the wrongs'
of landlordism- and in' a demand for relief from the
alleged over-taxation of Ireland.' ; With a united peo
ple-urging reforms of such importance 'it is folly for
any British statesman to' attempt to eliminate from
practical politics any one of the many phases of the
Irish question.
.'-*.ln. a "recent review of. the double -demand for bet
ter land" laws and lighter, taxation the Westminster
1 Gazette. says: "Great Britain is not at this moment
in a favorable position to meet either of these move
ments. With the burden of South Africa upon her
shoulders; she is not disposed either to relieve taxa
tion or to engage her credit in a gigantic operation
for compulsory land purchase in Ireland., Being un
able to give redress she is thrown back on her old
resourceâ the suppression of- agitators.. Meetings
have been broken up, members of Parliament have
been; imprisoned, and it is now- suggested that the
United Irish League shall be declared an illegal as
sociation. Thus we seem to be passing rapidly into
another period of coercion." : ....', 'Â¦
Lord Rosebery has advised the British Liberals
to drop the issue of home rule for.Ireland, but the
advice has been futile. '.In fact, were the Liberal
party to drop it altogether the Liberal party would
cease to be a factor in British politics. Rosebery
might as well have. advised his party to drop the issue
in South Africa. The Irish, question is not a crea
tion' of politicians, which' they can make or unmake
at their option. It arises out of the very nature of the

DILLON'S fierce controversy with Chamber
lain, which has led to his suspension from
the Commons, was precipitated by Irish sym
pathy with the Boers, v That"; sympathy, however,
would not have led to such an outbreak* of wrath on
the part of the Irish leader had there not been a
deeper cause of antagonism behind it. Not the
wrongs done to South , Africa but the wrong done
to Ireland is the primal element in the intense feel

of how fiercely that feeling glows.
BRITAIN'S IRISH; QUESTION.
;';A Kansas City man won a wager the other day by
having himself shipped in" a sack, as potatoes. - He
traveled tied in the â¢ bag for nearly four, days and
won. The man who shipped him has just reason to
complain that he paid more to the railroad company
than the intrinsic value of the freight warranted.
But how do the farmers like it? They are brushed
off the question by this Cuban bravo as if they were
vermin, while he boasts that the profit they enjoy in
its wide distribution is to be legislated to one planter,
not by his own Government, but by that which th*e
American farmer* elects. . ,
Senor Abad has the true 1 swagger of his race. His
boast should make every American Congressman's
palm tingle to slap it back down his throat.
Ponder that for a moment. It means that the
profit which protection distributes to tens of thou
sands of American farmers, in New York, Michigan,
Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, California and elsewhere,
is to be concentrated and all given to one cane
planter in Cuba, and he a Spaniard and an alien!
At present many thousand farmers are engaged in
this industry. Its profits are not confined to a few
great planters, but are diffused and divided among
thousands. With this' fact fixed in his mind let the
American farmer read the ' sayings of Senor Abad,
one of the Cuban junta in Washington. The Senor
said on the 12th inst. in Washington: "We have
neither retired nor become discouraged on account
of some opposition in Congress" to "giving us justice.
Mr. Gamba, Mr.'- Place and Mr. Menddza, the other
Cuban gentlemen associated with me,; are business
men and cannot leave their affairs for long at a time.
Among them are sugar planters who alone produce
as much sugar as that produced by all the beet sugar
growers of the United States."
If the American farmers supply the domestic de
mand for sugar, as they can, their farms will employ
more than half a million workmen in that industry.
They willpay American wages and yet get a profit of
nearly $50 per acre.
In time the promise of the protectionist leaders
that the -farmers' turn should come seemed to be re-,
deemed." The people were paying $100,000,000 a year
for foreign-grown sugar. By protection to., the
farmer, which would not burden the consumer by a
higher charge, this $ioo,qoo,ooo could be . kept at
home and added to the profits of agriculture. Re
lying, on the stability of protection as an economic
principle, the farmers and the beet sugar millers in
vested and launched an enterprise which had ahead
the prize of $100,000,000. Just as the farmers begin
to get a share of protection and begin to believe that
the benefits of that economic principle are general
and not partial, the Cuban planters, the junta, the
generals of our army, inform the country that its
pledge to Cuba requires the sacrifice of the American
farmer! His prosperity is held to be nothing, and
as he sees his infant industry dying in its cradle, he
is told that somebody pledged him to make the Cu
ban people permanently prosperous even if he have
to mortgage his farm to do it! â¢ â¢ â¢
We have raised the voice of warning that when
Republicans admit that protection is not an enduring
economic principle, but solely a policy of expediency
only, its days, are numbered. Such men are making
free traders faster than they can be initiated and get
the grip and the password. The people have seen the
splendid effect of protection in domesticating the
manufacture of tinplate and scores of other exotic
manufacturing industries for th'e products of which
we formerly paid out tens of millions of dollars, now;
kept at home and paid to American labor. : The peo
ple bore patiently their, share of the self-denial and
sacrifice required to secure industrial independence
by such additions to our productive power and va
riety. None bore it more patiently ; nor sacrificed
more in its behalf than the American farmers. They
never flinched, but walked to the polls and voted for
protection and went home and toiled in their fields
to make it effective. . : :
If such a. pledge were made why do not the junta
or the free traders produce it? Great- interests are
not to be made the Victim of a policy based upon a
pledge that no one produces/ that' rests solely in the
expressions of the junta and its organs.. The Ameri

fends them all in. the interest of the Cuban sugar
planters.

But If Preston or Flint should be chosen

wt>uld the Senate care for Gage or â¢ his

to do him reverence. The holdovers and
the new Senators of the party would refer
the communication of. the outgoing Gov
ernor to a committee and wait to ascer
tain the wishes of the Incoming executive.
Cutler was right when he advised the
Governor of the risk that: one takes in
handling edged tools. Gage may compel

them from dismissal if he loses. If he

confirm the 'appointments made during

At that time Gage was adjusting the
v.'ires to gain a renomination. He wanted
a club to hold over every appointee of
his administration so that he could say:
"Your term of office expires at the end
of the next session. If you fail to deliver
delegations pledged to my support in the
nominating convention I shall appoint
some other person to the office that you
now hold. 1 am not bound to send your
name to the Senate for confirmation. In
fact, I can withdraw your appointment
and send in another."

The true inside history of the scheme is
just coming to light: The amendment did
not escape .the! vigilant scrutiny of Sena
tor Cutter, whose long experience in the
Legislature has taught him to read be
tween the lines of. a bill. He. saw at a
glance that Oneal, a new Senator, was
plunging on dangerous ground. Senator
Cutter quickly -resolved to fight the meas
ure and thus uncover the hidden influ
ences behind the amendment. Within two
hours after he opened the battle Governer
Gage sent for him. The Senator went to
the executive office to hear what the
Governor had to say. Gage lost no timo
in telling Cutter that he wanted the bill
passed. Cutter insisted that the Governor
was playing with edged tools and that it
would be bad politics to change the law.
Gage declined to argue the point, but
again requested Cutter' to keep hands off
and let the bill become a law. "It is my
bill," said the Governor, "and I want the
Legislature to pass it." Senator. Cutter
was not in position at that time to engage
in a controversy with the executive and
therefore agreed to comply with the Gov
ernor'b wishes. The. bill went through
both houses and was signed by the Gov
ernor. > â¢ ,

The Republican party of California,

In convention affairs. Throughout the
State Lynch Is known as the confidential
man of Herrin, and it is quite well/ un

Prominent Republicans in the Gage. camp

party to pull him through. Colonel. George 1
Stone, chairman of the i Republican" State
Central Committee, recently said to an
other member of the committee: "I do
not know what we. will do for money In
this campaign. The bankers, merchants
and business men will not contribute for
fear Gage will be the candidate. There is
only one banker we can count on and his
subscription seldom goes above $250."
Men who ought to have the stamina
and frankness to tell Gage the truth
about -his chances inflate him with hot
air. If they would speak out candidly
they would advise him that outside of his
coterie ! of State administration office
holders and beyond the circle of a few
Democratic agitators, there is no demand
for his re-election. His open alliance with
Burns and Herrin causes the people to be

The committee, consisting of William

The Grand Jury at a -special, meeting
last night adopted a, report of the com
mittee on Â¦ corporations, street, railways
and telephones which urges \ upon , the Su- (
pervlsors_the necessity' of legislation to
correct numerous evils in the street rail
way.'servlce.; Franchises, a uniform sys
tem of transfers, overcrowding of cars,
fast,, running of electric cars and 3-cent
fare' for j workingmen are j some of the
subjects given vigorous- treatment. ;
With the knowledge that McComb can
not be confirmed the friends of the va
rious candidates for the clerkship are
ready to pull wires to secure the votes of
the Justices.
MtComb's name is now before the board
as the selection of the Justices, and the
ppecial and Judiciary Committees of the
Supervisors will not present any recom
mendation to the board.
Mayor Schmitz informed the Supervis
ors that he could not Indorse the name
of McComb. The Mayor explained that
he did not care if a Democrat or a Re
publican was elected to the offi.ee of Jus
tices' clerk, but he could not possibly in
dorse McComb, who had . been : removed
from office by the Mayor's actions. Mayor
Schmitz further stated that he desired no
patronage in the office, but simply wanted
a good man to be appointed. -
The conference ilnally ended with the
decision that Supervisors Wynn and Bent
meet with the Justices of the Peace to
day and request-- them to 'select another
name for presentation to the Supervisors.
As the Board of Supervisors has al
ready Intimated by Its actions that It will
not be antagonistic to the Mayor in the
Indorsement of a clerk to the Justices,
there is no chance for McComb to secure
the coveted office. Â¦ â¢
Yesterday afternoon the spec>.i-commit
tee of the Supervisors appointed to con
fer with the Justices and Mayor, Schmitz
on the matter met the Mayor and the
Judiciary Committee of the .Supervisors.'
Supervisors Comte and Booth represented
the committee and Supervisors Bent,'
Comte and Wynn the special committee.
Brandenstein of the Judiciary Committee,
who introduced the resolution calling the
conference, was not present. Â¦

Chairman Webster introduced Burt Estes
Howard,. M. A.,- assistant .Professor, .of

who spoke on "Education- arid Democra-.
cy." At -the, outset .he .said, he' did not
propose to talk shop. lie stated he had
overheard the teachers on their 'way to
the institute. doing this. In part he said:
What Democracy Means."
Democracy is not the best -form of . govern
ment, la certain conditions 'It may' be the
worst possible form J of government.-' ' Democ
racy is a form of ; government ..only for. the
best and most .upright people-. â¢ Democracy
without . conscience is dangerous. . Democracy
without Integrity Is destructive. Liberty with
out self-control Is anarchy. .Liberty without
conscience r Is ' hell. Democracy -Is far - more
than a kind or a political mission. It 1* a
co-operative commonwealth. The keynote ' of
democracy- Is -not' liberty,- but- responsibility.
If the keynote of democracy is Â¦ fidelity Â¦ the
keynote ot cltlrenshlp Is> integrity. * -^ "
Education means much to every government.
Education Is far more Important than a mere
knowledge of booklore. .A college diploma does
not (signify that a' man has been . educated.
It only fhowg.'he had a -chance.- As a col
league of mine once ' said, "he has been ex
posed." I assure you. there are a good many
immunes In our colleges. .
No education is complete' that does not
equip men to become good â¢ citizen.*. I will
plead this day for the training of -our youth
In a true and noble patriotism. Not that'patri
otism.that waits' for the trumpet to sound for
battle. America .will never want f6r "sons"
brave enough to- die for her and women to
weep. I plead. Tor. the higher. patriotism that
is willing to live for America.; for. men: who
day by day- are living as citizen* of -the re
public, striving to translate our idea c of po
litical righteousness . Into the â¢ highest , future
of political righteousness. ,.: . . - . - -

STEAMSHIP HURONIAN
IS THOUGHT TO BE LOST
ST. JOHNS. N. F.. March 21.-The in
coming shipping brings no report of the
Allen liner Huronian. Captain Brodie,
from Glasgow February 11 for St. Johns,
and row about ore month ovtrdue.
It is generally believed in marifme cir
cles he-re that the Huronian foundereci
Â¦with all hands or that sho sank as a re
sult of colliding with ice in the North
Atlantic. There is a bare possibility that
she has been caught in the ice floes and
that her crew has been rescued by. some
sealing steamer, as was done in the cast;
of another steamer a few years ago. This,
however. Is thought to be very unlikely.

COMPLETE REINSTATEMENT
Should He Succeed He Will Become a
Bear Admiral Within a
Year.
WASHINGTON*. March 21.â It is under
stood that Captain Joseph B. Coghlan is
about to be advanced five numbers on the
list of naval captains through the remis
sion by the President of part of the sen
tence of a court-martial from which he Is

Years ago, when the captain was a
Junior officer, he clashed with the detaii
officer of the Navy Department, and for
writing a sharp letter was court-mar
tialed and sentenced to lose eleven num
bers in his grade. By the special act re
warding the captains of the .United States
fleet engaged In the battle of Manila Bay-
Captain Coghlan regained some of the
lost numbers, and he row seeks to be
completely reinstated. This would place
Captain Coprhlan necond on -the list of
naval captains. Just below Captain Sands,
jumping him over Captains Clark, Cook.
Wise and Yates Sterling, and he would
become a rear admiral in the course of
the year through thÂ»Â» retirements of Rear
Admirals Remey and Farquhar.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 2LâIndict
ments against former Internal Revenue
Collector Charles E. Sapp, Leonard Par
dons, assignment clerk- under Collector
Sapp, and Joseph Potoning were returned
by the Federal Grand Jury yesterday aft
ernoon and made public to-day. Ball in

Imminent.
v /'I propose as chairman of the, supply
committee,"' said Roncovieri, "to buy as
many towels as may be needed. I will
continue to- supply them as fast as they
are ' asked i for by the schools, and' when
there, are -no more I will buy a further
supply.'.';- v ". ; ' . , .
Honcovieri is not pleased at the attitude
takenby Woodward on all resolutions In
troduced by the former, and an open clash
between the two directors is imminent.
Roncovieri points to' the fact that his res
, olutions have I been opposed on. all occa
sions by-Woodward. The former is at - a
loss to understand the latter's opposition,
especially as .both were appointed by
Mayor Schmitz. When Roncovieri desired
to have an extra. class in the Telegraph
Hill school Woodward voted against it,
although Â¦ Roncovieri voted for Wood
ward's resolution to form an additional
class, in the Marshall Primary School.
Many other Instances . of the Jtind are
cited by Roncovieri, and! It is quite likely
-that- the Mayor will have to pour oil on
.the. troubled waters. ,' Roncovieri does not
think' that Woodward's attitude Is the re
sultof hia not receiving the appointment
to the first vacanpy on the School Board.

dividual drinking cup."
'.-Mark and Woodward stood -by Denman!
and i the' resolution was . lost. Koncovieri
was so-muclr-put out at the action of. his
colleagues that he decided not to present
his .resolution' providing for the purchase
of soap and towels. : â¢ Â¦
The Board of Education at Its last ex
ecutive session refused to adopt Director
Roncovieri's resolution providing for the
installation of Individual drinking 1 cups in

urged | the ] adoption of the resolution on

"COFFEE HEARTS."
More Frequent Than Tobacco Hearts.
Coffee drinking frequently affects the
heart, and many cases of heart trouble
are relieved or entirely cured by leaving
off. coffee and taking on Postum Food
Coffee.
A good Illustration is that of a lady who
says: "I was troubled for many years
with my heart, and at times would be-
come unconscious. The children have
many, times run for the neighbors to coine
In and restore me by putting my feet in
hot water and rubbing me.
"Dr. Short frequently told me that cof-
fee was a poison to me and was really
tbe cause of my weak heart. I could not
do without the coffee though, but flnally
the doctor told me it was certain death If
I did not give It up. This was about five
years ago, and J changed from coffee to
PoEtum Food Coffee, ily. heart trouble
gradually disappeared and now I am en-
tirely wellâ have never used a particle of
coffee since my nrst cup of Postum.
"I gave a little Postum to a lady friend
one day to take home and : try. She re-
ported that she did. not like it at-alL I
found she. boiled' It only five minutes, so I
gave her some more and told her to boll it
twenty minutes.. That was different: She
has been using Postum now. a long time.
\ "It cured her daughter of liver trouble,
restored her fresh, pretty complexion, and
cured the mother from ' headaches, from
which she suffered severely." Mrs. M.

efit I have; received through the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound and Liver Pills. When I was about seventeen
years old I suddenly seemed to lose my usual good health and vitality.
1 Father said I studied too hard, but the doctor thought different and pre-
scribed'tonics,- which I took bv the quart without relief. Reading one
day in the paper of Mrs'.- Pinkham's great cures, and finding the symp-
toms described /answered mine, I decided I would give Xydia E. Pink-
. hani's Vegetable Compound a trial. ; I did not say a word to the
doctor ; I bought it myselT/and took it according to directions regularly
â¢for- two ; months, and "I; found that' I gradually improved, and : that all
pains left me and I was my old self once more.- I can ride fifty and one

The doubt as to the cause of the death
of Nathan Jacobs has been entirely dis
pelled. He had been a sufterer from
Bright's disease and fatty degeneration
of the heart for some time, and was in
the habit of taking potions in order to
f,et sleep. He retired Wednesday evening
in the best of spirits, set his alarm cIock
and made all preparations to go to his
â¢work in the morning. It is thought that
he went to . take his medicine as usual
and In mistake took a dose of cyanide of
potassium, which was on the stand. The
fctomach, on examination by City Toxi
cologist Charles L. Morgan, showed that
potassium cyanide had been taken, this'
giving rise to the suicide theory. â¢ Â¦
llr. .Jacobs â¢ was . a native son, 44 years
old 'and sx. traveling- .salesman, tor Calm,
Nlckelsburg &. Co. He had been with
that .firm twenty-five years and' was re-
garded as one of the best and most popu
lar men In its employ. He was a mem
ber of the Elks, the Pacific Coast Com
mercial Travelers' Association and ' the
United Commercial Travelers. The Elks
have charge of the funeral, which will
be held to-morrow, at 2 p. m. The pall
bearers will be chosen from the organi

in Holy Cross Cemetery.

â¢i.City. Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday in reply, to a question of the Board
of. Supervisors "whether or not the a '
ter- gives the board, upon recommenda
tion of the Mayor, the power to create
the position of cashier of the license de
partment of the Tax Collector's office,
and if such power Is- given, must the ap
pointment be made from the civil service
list." The attorney saya:
â¢ My opinion is that whenever the Mayor
rhall recommend to the Supervisors that they
authorize the appointment of an additional
' employe in. any department; the Â¦ Supervisors,
by an afflmatlve vote of fourteen members,
Â¦ may authorize such appointment. Such addl
tional cashier would be an additional em
ploye under the Tax Collector. â Inasmuch as
the Tax Collector ' has power to appcinc out-,
side of the civil service -list but one cashier
for his Â¦ department, ' on additional cashier, K
allowed by the board, must be appointed . in
' conformity with the civil service article.
Pending the holding of an examination
for the position for. which there are now
no civil service eligioles. the Tax Collect
or will appoint Hugo Herzer to the place
if the board adopts the - recommendation
Â¦of the Mayor that it be created.

What has become of the $117,500 that Dr.

of money 'spent in Dalton's endeavor to

LOS ANOELES, , ilarch ZLâ United ;
States Senator W. A. Clark has acquired
control of the Los Angeles Traction Com
pany and .he is prepared to, expend a
targe sum to be used in expanding ihÂ«
property. Thomas Â£. Gibbon arrlvtd
to-uay irom Washington, wnere he went
tor tne' purpose of consummating the deal
between denator ClarK and the Hooks.
"\Vhfin Gibbon departed for the national
capital he carried the documents neces
sary to complete the tra;;ster. These pa
pers, signed, sealed and delivered, fta
Drought- with him Vn his return trip.
Gibbon was loth to enter into details
regarding the new Traction-Clark al-
I liance further than to admit that Senator
.Clark now is interested in the Traction
: Company and as soon as the necessary
franchises are obtained the Hook ' system
will be enlarged and brought down to
date. Local lines are to be perfected In
; all parts /of the city and an lnterurban
system is to be constructed. The extent
of Senator Clark's holdings in the Trac
tion system Gibbon declined to discuss,
'except to contirm that the ' Senator ia in
the enterprise and he already has spent a
large amount of money in his new deal.
"T hose acquainted with Senator Clark
know he docs not take the little end in
any business venture," remarked Gibbon.
. Discussing the San Francisco story that
former, .differences have arisen again be
tween the San Pedro. Los Angeles and
Salt Lake Railroad and the -Harrtman
syndicate incidental to joint surveys
through Nevada Gibbon said:
"Both : parties in the Issue signed con
tracts in January in which it was agreed
whenever a disagreement might arise the
services of Virgil Bogue, an eminent en
gineer of New York, should be obtained
I as arbitrator. One point along the route
I of both lines is in question and Bogue
may be aopealed to In that particular in
stance. Further than that there is no
dispute of any sort. It is not .true the
issue has been withdrawn from the legal
department of the interests affected."

W. H. Phillips, who resigned his position at
chief engineer of the army transport War
ren aÂ». Honolulu, characterizes as "rot", the
publlihed reports to the effect that the War
ren's engines are In bad condition.
"There Is not a better engtned vessel sailing
from this port," he said yesterday, "and her
machinery when she left hero was In perfect
condition. The, Warren's engines will be do-
Ing good service, when plenty of new engines
I could tell of are on the scrap pile. And
when the Warren's engines are played out there
will be enough good material left to build new
engines."
Says Engines Are All Bight.

Rev. J. W. Ricketts, Sugar Grove, Ohio,
cheerfully testifies as follows: "I have
been a sufferer from dyspepsia, attended
with biliousness and constipation, for a
number of years. During the last year it
became bo much worse that I had a miÂ«-
rr.v In my stomach nearly all the time,
nnd my flesh left me, until I wan a mere
*kr>leton. I have tiiÂ«ed four bottles of
Paine's Celery Compound and am now
nt my normal weight. You cannot recom-
mend Paine'i* Celery Compound too highly
for chronic dyspppula."
Mrs. Jennie \\. Steele. Vaughns, Ga..
who wan rescued from the agonies of a
terrible dlscABe and uurÂ« death, nays: "I
have suffered for ten years with what thÂ«
doctors called neuralpla of the liver, and
never had any relief until I began to
tako Paine's' Celery Compound. 1 have
taken about three bottlea and have not
suffered nny since I first began to use it.
I feel that Paine's Celery Compound
saved my life."
Paine's Celery Compound taken during
the opening of epring has a remarkable
efficacy in making: Eick people well and
strong. It makes short work of debility
and nervous exhaustion. It quickly drives
out neuralgia, rheumatism, sleeplessness
and dyspepsia from the system. Its vir-
tues promptly banish kidney disease and
liver troubles. , It enables all weak and
run down men and women to cast off
their besetting troubles and gives them
a happy and vigorous life.
Palne'6 Celery Compound . purifies the
blood as nothing: else can do; it is na-
ture's brain food; it builds up weak and
shattered nerves; it Is the world's best
and surest health giver.
It Nourishes the Tired Brain and

NEW YORK. March 21. â To-day's stock
market was still highly professional and there
was abnormal activity In stocks which are
usually not a flsrure in the trading. ConMd
erab!y more attention, however, was given to
the representative stocks in the list, which are
quite generally higher as * result of the day's
trading. In most instances the gains were
merely fractional, but in such stocks ae St.
Paul, Louisville and Nash\-ille, Illinois Cen
tral and St. Louis and San Francisco there are
substantial net jra-in* recorded. Rock Island
moved rapidly upward in the last hour to J80,,
a net rise of 7^4. There was no special ex
planation of this sensational advance, but the
traders were inclined to buy the Granger? and
fcouthwe-Fterns on the strength of reports of
lain In the Southwest and the hope of bene
fit to the Western wheat crop. Sugar was In
clined to be heavy during- the early dealings,
but bt-came very strong toward the close, rts
mg more than 3 points over last night and
closing with a net pain of 2%. Amalgamated
Copprr was heavy all day on a rather smaller
volume of dealing)! than lately, but a. late re
<-ovcry left it enly a fraction lower on the
<Jay. The speculation in Colorado Fuel contin
ued vpry active and feverish, the price rising

CHICAGO, i March 21. â Wheat opened weak
and lower on good rains In many of the wheat
States and' declined . still further on rather
heavy selling. These rains were much needed
and were supposed to be beneficial to the grow
ing crop. Argentine reports Indicated an in
creased movement and. still better prospects.
Cables were slightly higher, but had little ef
fect. > Added to this bearish Influence was the
advice from ' New York that much of the stuff
reported sold. for export yesterday was still for
sale. /May wheat, which opened- a shade to %
@%c; lower, at 74%@73%c,- sold off to 73%c.
Then came a revival of- yesterday's export busi

flrm for a time- at 74%@74Vic. The Southwest
ern reports, however, had the . most Influence
in this market. St." Louts and Kansas City
were we,ak ; and sold liberally. Liquidation
started In on a free sbale late in the day, bears

at the opentng on account of general rains in
Kansas, with more buyers than sellers. Ther^
was a good cash business again, which largely
offset the softening effect of the rains. The
Modern Miller was bearish, saying that the
rains had given 'full relief. .. The feature of tho
day was the marked Increase In ! the demand
for export, as the market has now Â¦ got ' down
to an export basis and Europe evidently' wants
American -wheat. From all quarters , came re
ports of sales for export account. '<Â¦, Vessel room
was taken for 300,000 bushels for Buffalo. New

City 50.000, while . Minneapolis wired that the
entire Fort-Wllllams stock and. all the Mani

on Thursday and reported 415,000 yesterday,
with more working. Minneapolis, stocks were
eptlirifcted to show a decrease for the weelu.of
450,000 and Bradstreet' s gave the exports from
the. whole country for the week at 4,326,000

the action taken at the so-called mass meeting
held at Metropolitan Temple on Thursday night
under the auspices of Union No. 483, it not
being r>cs3ible for more than 150 men from
483 -and some outside unions to rexister their
wishes to, the exclusion of the hundreds of
others 'who desired by their voice and voti>
to protest arainst the action taken, and that
we reaffirm our. loyalty to the Building .Trades
Council and our brotherhood, and that we, the
member* of Union -22, warn all our members
against believing any statements or resolutions
emanating from that, meeting, .as they were
not the wish of the people present, but .rather
pOtr- through by -the -gag". law: 6f Mr. Malsbury,"
the chairman, and that he be censured by this
union for' refusing to put the 'amendment,
which was regularly moved and seconded, de
ceiving those present, . they believing that they
were votint: on the amendment, and then at
once, adjourned the: grand, farce. And that
copies be sent to the different unions and to

SKATTLE. March 21.â President H. C.
Baker of the Building Trades Council
-was expelled from that organization at a
meeting to-night on the grounds of mis
appropriating funds supplied by tlie Re
publican City Central Committee to be
used for legitimate purposes during j the
last' municipal campaign. The accused
practically % admits 9 his â¢ guilt, but claims
in : .vindication of his action .that he . ex
pended the money in furthering the inter
ests of the Republican ticket at the polls.
Prior to the last municipal â¢ electiop a
committee, was /selected by the Building
Trades Council to Interview the candi
dates of the various parties \and learn
trjeir inclination as regards organized la
bor. , By virtue of his office . President
Baker. was a member of the committee.
President Baker and James Hopkirk
went to Chairman Miller of the Republi
can. City Central Committee, a few days
prior to the election and received- from
aim $200. It was agreed that if the Re
publican ticket should not be indorsed,
the money was to be returned the follow
ing day. The money was turned over to
President Baker in person. '
.When the council met an attempt was
made to Indorse the Republican ticket,
which the committee had concluded was
most friendly to the interests of organ
ized labor, but so determined a flght was
made against the action tnat the meeting
closed without the nominees of any ticket
receiving an indorsement. - - -
Some time passed- before the executive
committee of the council learned that, the
money had not been returned. A commit
tee-waited on President Baker. He ad
mitted that he had not returned the
money, but claimed that he had spent it
in the interests of the Republicans.. The
committee further' learned- that certain
persons claiming- to be representatives of
the Building Trades Council had gone to
J. W. Godwin,- Democratic candidate,
and informed him that It was the inten
tion of the .council to indorse the nom
inees of the Republican ticket.
It is alleged that these persons further
informed Godwin that by the judicious
expenditure of money this plan of Indorse
ment could be prevented from being car
ried :' into, execution. 'Godwin admitted
that President. Baker was one of those
who had seen him and he believed the
name of. another was Hopkirk. ?-;,~
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The' difficulty arises through the fact
that the treaty existing at the time the
crime was committed and at the time the
extradition papers were signed has since
been annulled by the Government of
Mexico. A new treaty is now in existence
and criminals extraditable under the. old
one cannot be delivered over by the Gov
ernment under the treaty of to-day.
EL. PASO. Texas, March 21.â An Inter
national controversy is likely to arise over
the extradition of Charles Gilbert Webb,
captured "Wednesday morning in Mexico,
and wanted for eight years on a charge of
robbing a mail coach in Idaho. Webb is
now in Jail in Parral. According to Mex
ican Consul Mellen of this city the ma, n
cannot be extradia ted unless this gov
ernment makes an especial request of
Mexico and agrees to deliver to the Mex
ican Government all Mexican criminals
or .suspects arrested under like circum
stances-in this . country.

GATTTER IN THE RECOUNT
pending: an Investigation Into the death
of Eujrene J. McCarthy, was formally
charged with manslaughter last ntght.
The complaint was based on the verdict
cf .the Coroner's Jury, which found that
McCarthy met his death by being run
over by car No. 10 of the Sutler Street
Company, at Ninth and Folsom streets,
after being knocked down by. some party
or parties unknown. The testimony
Â¦ rhowed that Eugene and Dan McCarthy
said John Cahill had engaged in a fi^ht,
and in view of this the jury decided that
Oahill was "guilty" of involuntary man
slaughter. Dan McCarthy, who was ar
xested at the same time as Cahill, was
discharged.
Some evidence was introduced tending
to show that others might iiave been en
gaged in the tight which ended in Mc-
Carthy's death, but there remained con
siderable doubt as to the identity of the
man who actually delivered the blow
which 6ent the dead man beneath the car.
John Cahill Held Responsible for
Death of Eugene J. Mc-
Carthy.

.City Prison since the night of March 16,

It is expected that It will be consum

mine, is at the Palace Hotel. He has
traveled all the way from Utah to. treat

When seen lost night McCormick was
loth to say anything about the proposed
combination, but he admitted that, 'the
corporations that control the mines' in
question were considering the advisabil
ity of euch a step. He said that the-ob
ject of the combination would be to- settle
certain disputes that had arisen between
the Quincy and Daily West .companies.'
McCormick stated that if- the mines were
not consolidated or 'some other adjust
ment made a legal controversy . would
likely ensue. As the mines represent "a
value of several million dollars, a strenu
ous effort will be made to prevent them
from becoming embroiled in any. expen

Jury Finds Him Qiiilty
; onHhe 'Charge of
Murder. Â¦
Last of Rice's Slayers Is
Convicted of Brutal
Assassination.
Aiter an hour's .deliberation the Jury
in the^case of- Edward Duncan, charged
with complicity in ', murdering George. W.
Rice, on the night of October II," returned
1 a .verdict last evening finding the defend
ant guilty of murder in the second de
gree. Â¦ - Â¦ . Â¦ - .'.Â¦Â¦Â¦
-This makes the fourth conviction in this
case. . All of, the" men r accused of the
crime were, found 'to be implicated. liice
was a non-union machinist employod at
the Golden State and Miners' Iron WorÂ£s,
'237 -First 'street.; On the evening of Octo
ber llhe left his place of employment and
boarded < a Howurd-street. car on | his ' way
home." .; According -to the'., theory ''of the
prosecution he was' followed- by .William
Buckley. Thomas 'Moran, Charles. Don
nelly and Edward Duncan,' who intended
killing him. They boarded the same car,
and when . ho descended at Twenty-llrst
fctreet to go to hlÂ« home they left the car
and strucK him down in the street. While
he was prostrate one of the men, claimed
to be Buckley, flred five shots into Hire's
body, from which tie died in a fow hours.
Buckley was convicted of murder in the
first degree and Is now awaiting sentence.
Moran was found guilty of murder in"the
first degree, with punishment fixed by the
jury at life imprisonment. Donnelly, like
Duncun, was convicted of murder in the
second degree with a prior conviction of
felony.' â¢ ; ,
The prosecution claimed that â¢ Duncan
was the man who watched Rice leave the
iron works and signaled to the. other. men
that the. victim was aboard the. car. He
was, shown to have been present when
Rice was shot, but claimed to have been
collecting at a grocery store at Shotwell
and .Twenty-first streets when the murder
occurred. This testimony was â¢ contra
dieted ; .by the proprietor of the grocery,
'vho said Duncan , had . not been at his
place of; business that evening. .
.Duncan, expressed himself as confident
cf acquital during the entire trial and
seemed, not particularly concerned re
garding his position. When "he first
learned that he was wanted for the crime
he gave himself up. , Â¦

Â¦but get his pictures out of , the, Appraiser's
clutches the best way he could.- Walter
M Castlo and W. H. Wolf went his sure-
ties for $8100. covering the duties and ex-
penses, and it Is, expected that the paint-
ings will be released some time to-day. .

to the Philippines within six months. In
the meanwhile John-H. .Boden. the Cus-

before the General Board of Appraisers of
the United 'States. ; ' . ; .
That is where Socd's troubles com-
menced. 'He did not know that on March
8 a change was made in the tariff laws.
When he went after arrival to the Cus-
tom-house to secure the. release of his
pictures he was, confronted with the fol-
lowing dispatch: ,
"... WASHINGTON. P. â¢ C". March 15. 1902.

inst., enlisted, free entry.-
(Signed) O. L. SPAULDING.

While Socci was on the high seas with
i his painting the following, dispatch was
received from Washington:
Â¦ WASHINGTON. D. C. March 12, 1002.
Collector Customs. , San Franclaco, Cal. : Act
March 8 1002." provides that on and after that

to be levied, collected and paid upon vessels

countries. Take action accordingly. Further
Instructions Â¦ by malL 'â¢ Â¦ Â¦
E. T. CHAMBERLAIN. Commissioner.
Socci shipped the paintings from Manila
'on March 6. On March 8, the Congress of
" the " United States passed a special, bill
taxing certain commodities 20 per cent ad
valorem. The pictures came under a par-
ticular classification. When Socci chipped
them by the regular route of freight from
the >Philippine Islands to San Francisco
: he knew nothing of the newly imposed
special duty. " . . . .
. ThÂ« pictures, which represent the cap-
. ture of ' Manila by the American forces
and are 'historical representations . of the
events that then occurred, were shipped
to the United States for exhibition pur-
poses. Â¦ Â¦'.'Â¦.-"Â¦." Â¦
ffocd madÂ© his necessary declarations at
the Custom-house, but appraisers
held them fox payment of $3000 duty. The
duty was arbitrarily imposed: by reason
of the declarations made when the pict-
ures were shipped to San Francisco. It
was necessary, for. Socci to place a valua-
tion on the pictures, and the first figures
that came into his head were used.
A peculiar point .In the recent changes
in the tariff laws relating to the Insular
! possessions of the United States -was de-
veloped yesterday at the Custom-house,
'when D. A. Socci. an art dealer ot Manila,
i endeavored to secure the release of two
