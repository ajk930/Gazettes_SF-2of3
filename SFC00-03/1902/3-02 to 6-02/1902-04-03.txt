AGUINALDO ADMITS CRIME. 5
General Funston outlined soriie of the
campaigns that followed and said that In
November of 1899 Aguinaldo and some of
his chieftains held a conference and de
cided to abandon organized - resistance
and disband their forces, the men to be
assembled' later into guerrilla bands and
make war upon the Americans and all
natives who should be suspected- of be
friending them. Continuing he said: Â¦'.',,
himself for advancing- after being chal
lenged and had been tried by court
martial he would have gone scot free. If
any man is looking for excitement I would
advise him to try shooting the rapids . at
Niagara rather than running down an

"The blood of those two or three thou

chieftain, was free from the stain of such
crimes. Aguinaldo admitted to me with
out reservation that he had caused the
assassination of General Luna, because
Luna was so brave and able that his own
supremacy, which he deemed essential to
Filipino success, was-in danger. He made
the same statement to^Lieutenants Haz
ard and Mitchell and f to others. Indeed,
that he caused Luna's assassination Is not
questioned at all in the Philippines.- I
do not care to run Aguinaldo down either,
for personally I owe him a great deal. I
will say this for him, that he treated
American prisoners, and Spanish "prison
ers, too, with great humanity whenever
they were under his immediate eye. But
horrible atrocities were committed by his
subordinates.
NO REPLY TO CRITICISMS.
The speaker did not touch upon the
criticisms upon his methods, in effecting
the capture of Aguinaldo, except to assert
that the Filipinos had no distinctive uni
form, they having taken for themselves
the Spanish uniform. Ergo, it Is to be in
ferred, it was no offense against the rules
of civilized warfare to dress four of his
own soldiers in that attire In order to
carry out his plan to capture the Filipino
chieftain. Finally he had no criticism for
the Taf t Commission, but approved The
partial eelf-grovernment given the Fili
pinos ' by Taft and his associates, thus
again arraying: himself with the adminis
tration.

to the insistent demands of the ban
queters, from which, as he put it. he saw
there was no escape, he spoke at some
length on the Philippine question, but
skillfully avoided some of the reported
assertions that made his recent Lotus
Club speech a national sensation. ;
The captor of Aguinaldo placed respon
sibility for the continuance of the insur
gent struggle after the breaking up of
Agnlnaldo's army Into guerilla bands, in
January, 1900, squarely upon the should
ers of the anti-Imperialists at home. He
said their Intemperate utterances led the
insurgent leaders to believe that the
United States was on the verge of civil
war and that they had only to continue
the Etruggrle until internecine strife
ehould break out between the two par
ties in America. But while General Fun
ston spoke approvingly of the hanging of
some 200 Filipino bad men, he did not
even hint that sundry gentlemen of Bos

Continuing, General Funston spoke in

"I know you do not want me to Bay any

leave a bad taste in the mouth. So, with
your permission! I will, to use a slang ex
pression, "go way back arid sit down.' "
And Funston sat down, but > th'e ban
queters demanded that he continue, and
after some hesitation he '] proceeded. He
Epoke at some length of the conditions
that prevailed after the destruction of the
Spanish fleet and the . responsibility that
rested with the United States to protect
the defenseless city against . the . insur
gents. He described conditions following
the surrender of Manila, with a line of in
surgents drawn about the city, parallel
ing the . American forces and practically
besieging them. He said the Instruction
from General Otis was to let no taunt nor
insult or even overt act precipitate trouble
and 'the "men endured - with Â¦ remarkable
self-control the constant taunts and abuse
of the Filipinos. 'â¢ 1 *<
BEGINNING OF THE STRUGGLE.
"Gentlemen of the Ohio Society: I am
somewhat in the condition of a certain
distinguished member of Congress who
used to say, 'Gentlemen, where are we
at?' I don't know, whether I should be
classed as an Ohioan, a Kansan or a Cal
if ornlan. I was born in Ohio, but found
I could not support my parents there, so
when I was two years of age I took them,
out to Kansas with me. Then the fortune
of war brought me to California, and
here I did the smartest thing I ever did
in my life, and that was to marry a Cali
fornia girl.
STARTED LIFE IN OHIO.
General Funston began his speech as
follows:
sent regrets, and also George A. Knight,
who was to represent him. But just . as
W. H. Jordan, president of the Ohio So
ciety, concluded a neat speech of intro
duction It was understood that his Ex
cellency by proxy had left the banquet
hall and he did not return.
Rear Admiral Glass, also a guest , of
honor, responded with patriotic ardor to
the toast, "Our Navy."
"Politics I.i back of the whole thing.

and these suits are being brought at this
time to hurt me politically. My political
enemies â¢ have . resorted ;to the courts " to

Mr. Dalton made this statement:
"As for the books, Mr. Dalton certified
that they were properly bound for the
years of 18C8 and 1S99 when they were not,
arid the' coiirity was injured to the amount
of $120 for each year. ; The County Auditor
and county expert in-lS99, assisted by the
Supervisors and the Grand Jury, forced
the rebinding of the books, while those of,
1898 still stand 'in the canvas binding in
stead i of the" leather binding .required by
the specifications. ' At ; no . time i did Mr.
Dalton order, the books rebound. -
"This suit 1 has : nothing to do with the
litigation that is now pending over the
Oakland Enquirer. I am not connected
with that litigation in any way and have
paid' but little attention to it. This
action . is ; entirely independent and does
not _ concern ; the troubles between the
stockholders, in that newspaper."
BOOKS IMPROPERLY BOUND.
"As, to the. law, I do not see how Mr.
Dalton can ; escape.* The section of the
Penal', Code rounder . which . this . suit is
brought requires a trial by the court and
does not permit of an appeal to the Su
preme .Court. Judge â¢ Ogden has decided
that. Mr. Dalton o illegally.', withheld the
poll' tax commissions, .and that ho was
only entitled to. his exact expenses in
making up the city, assessment rolls.
These expenses were fixed- by Judge Og
den at, $2100 for two years, but we believe
that this -work was done by Mr. Dal
ton's deputies while under pay from the
county, arid that the county is entitled to
those fees. We think that this can bo
shown. " ' - â¢
"This matter has been under investiga
tion some time. -Mr. Crane informs
me that for two years he has been keep-
Ing watch. He decided to await the deci
sion of Judge Ogden in the matter of Mr.
Dalton's fees.* As it supported Mr. Crane's
position,', he instructed me to file the suit.
Attorney de Golia said:
<: "I have been watching this matter for
nearly two years, and when the decision
*of Judge Ogden was rendered I communi
cated'with my' attorney, and as he da
cided that 'the law was correct I have
sworn '.to the complaint. -I believe that
Mr. Dalton has committed acts that bring
him under the law which demands his re
moval." ' . Â¦
Mr.: Crane said in regard to the action:
sions- for but two years were involved,
while, in "the Crane suit the commissions
for -three years 'are included, which ac
counts for the difference In figures.
Mr. Crane's accusation then seta forth
the facts that for 1S99 Mr. Dalton collected
12,596 poll taxes at $2 each, amounting to
$23,132, of which amount he only turned
into the treasury $21,413 20, retaining: for
himself $3778 SO. In the same year he col
lected 103 delinquent poll taxes at $3,
amounting to $309, of which he turned
$262 G5 into the treasury, retaining $46 35.
In 1S03 Mr. Dalton collected 12,283 poll
taxes, amounting to $21,536. of which
amount $20,855 60 was paid into the treas
ury and $3580 40 was retained. In the same
year there were 199 delinquent poll taxes
collected, aggregating $537, of which
amount $507 45 reached the treasury and
$83 S5 was retained. In 1901 the number of

The complaint is an unusual one and in
volves many points of law that are not at
all common. It took much research to
frame it. The document begins with this
statement:
"As to the retention of the commissions,
that was done under the advice of my

-One of the arguments against the pas
sage of this bill will be that it increases
the power of the Senate over, that of the,
House and enables the Senate to control
all legislation. This old argument:, is to
be presented in a new form by the oppo
nents of the territorial bill. Â£ They have
been studying the census report: for. 1900,
and find there are fifteen States with a
population combined of 1,064,000 voters.
These States are Idaho, Delaware, Mon
tana,, Nevada, North Dakota, Utah and
Wyoming, with one member each in ,the
House of Representatives, and Colorado,:
Florida, New Hampshire, Oregon, Rhode
Island,: South Dakota, Washington and
Vermont, each having two members in
the House of Representatives. These fif
teen States, with a. voting.- population r of
less .than â¢ that of - either. New York' or
Illinois, have only twenty-three ' members
of the House, but thirty United;. States
Senators., In the House they have no un
due proportion of power, but in the Sen
ate they represent one-third of that body
and are able to exercise great power in
all legislation. It is the fear, of Increas
ing, this power In the Senate- that is Im
pelling House leaders to oppose the ad
mission of these- three. -v. Territories, as
States. . Â¦:.' . v Â¦ '. â¢Â¦
tho Speaker a surprise by combining the
bills and bringing in the measure reported
yesterday that admitted all three Terri
tories as States. It is doubtful if the" Sen
ate can be relied upon to defeat this bfll
if it passes the House. If it is to be de r
feated it must be by a vote in the. House
of Representatives. ;

WASHINGTON. April 2.â The plan of
building warships in Government yards
was considered by the House Committee
on Naval Affairs to-daj 1 , a large delega
tion of labor representatives being pres
ent In support of it. The delegation In
cluded James McConnell, president of the
Machinists' Association, and several ship
building experts from Norfolk, Brooklyn
ajid other points having Government
yards. Â¦ .
McConnell made the main presentation,
urging that the Government had millions
invested in plants â¢ which- should be- used
for construction as well as repair of war
ships. When Representative â¢ Dayton sug
gested that Admiral Bowles,' chief of the
Naval Bureau of Construction, had stated
that he would not recommend the build
ing of ships in Government yards unless
the navy-yard wages were equalized, with
those of private yards, McConnell . said
the idea of lower wages could not have
been made seriously, at a time when the
tendencies were toward higner wages. He
argued that in the Interest of the public
Government construction would be bene
ficial and that incidentally the labor In
terests would be much benefited.; . . â¢-.

journed. ;â¢>.Â¦Â¦:â¢'.-â¢-.:â¢â¢- â¢'-. V
"But- is it. (the' raising' of revenue) the
paramount object?" Inquired Stewart* Of
Nevada. " â¢ . Â¦â¢ "
â¢ "It is the primary , object,'* replied
Spooner. _Â¦.>..
"But not the paramount object?" per
sisted the Nevada Senator. : : !
"I say. that the object of this b'll Is" to
raise-revenue," replied Spooner. "In other
words: -I- say tlmt- in â¢ the i exetcise'of the
discretion which the ronstitutlon gives ua
we . select this' article as an' object of
taxation." ' ' ' ' . .
"Will the Senator from Wisconsin Fay."
inquired Bailey, "that the object of the
bill is to raise revenue?" - \
At the conclusion â¢ of Depew's remarks
Bailey and Spooner became involved In a
colloquy as to some legal phases. of the
bill. â¢
To Raise Revenues.
Bailey sharply arraigned the creameries
and cheese factories of the country, the
former of which, he said, was the real
backer of the legislation proposed. He
could understand, he said, the Republican
policy of protection of industries, but this
new policy to legislate for the destruction
of Industries was entirely incomprehensi
ble to him. In the pending measure.
Bailey said in conclusion, the majority of
Congress was endeavoring to settle a con
tention among competing manufacturers.
j Depew to the Rescue. â¢
' Depew spoke in supfJort of the bill. He
said he never heard a speech which had
so fired his fancy, so appealed to his im
agination, and bad had so little effect on
his judgment as 'that of Bailey's. He had
been taught that competition was the life
of trade, but competition ought to be
/honest. If a merchant deceived his cus
tomers â¢ by foisting on them ;a fraud he
believed that man ought to be reached by
law, because S every man when - he pur
chased an article had a right to get what
he paid for. ; â¢ --
In the course of his brief speech De-.
pew, referring to' an allusion- made by
Bailey, said that the American girl had
been put in a wrong; position before the
people of the United States.
, "I forgot at the moment," interjected
Bailey, "a recent.. occurrence in the life of
the Senator from New York, or I should
not have made the allusjon." (Laughter.)
"And but for that occurrence," retorted
Denew, laughing aja he spoke, "I.shoujd
have, left- a younger man .to come to the
deferiseof the American girl. .It wajs'thk
Senator's youth and beauty (great laugh
ter) which, astonished me when he made
that remark. If he had been soured and
disappointed "in love> or if the sex, had
treated him in some way that would lead
to remark about it like that, I should
have understood him. But no one can
meet the Senator, no one can see him so
cially, or In his grave 'and dignified posi
tion, no one can see his photograph on
Pennsylvania- avenue, wlthout.recognlzlng
that his geniality, his happiness, his elo
quence, have come because the American
girl has admired him and loved-him."
(Long-continued laughter.) Â¦ Â¦ . . ; Â¦
"And he never ought to have gone-back
on her to-day by saying she is a fraudu
lent specimen of living oleomargarine."
(Laughter.) .
Bailey conceded' trie right of Congress to
enact the proposed, bill as a revenue
measure, and every Senator who support
ed the measure to raise revenue was en
tirely within his conscience and his oath
of c.Tice, but if any Senator should vote
for it to suppress the oleomargarine in
dustry he would "do violence to his sense
of duty and to his obligations of office."
He declared that the purpose of the bill
ij'as not to raise revenue, and in support
of ills assertion quoted the statements of
the principal proponents of the pending
measure.
"I undertake to say," said he, "that
there is not a man in this chamber who
either intends or expects to raise revenue
by this measiS*:-." -â¢ . ; â¢
He maintained that the propsed bill con
tained a palpable and even a wicked vio
lation of the/constitution In the placing of
a tax on Sn article manufactured and
sold within a State.
Talks Against the Taxi
WASHINGTON, April 2.â Discussion of
the oleomargarine bill in the Senate 10
day was relieved by two or three brijjht
colloquies between Senators. Ealley of
Texas concluded his speech begun yester
day in opposition to the measure, occupy
ing most of the time devoted by the Sen-^
ate to the billts consideration. His argu
ment was brilliant and at times eloquent,
and attracted the careful attention of
Senators on both â¢ sides of the chamber
and of the occupants of the crowded gal
leries. He was followed by Depew of New
York In a bright and witty speech in sup
port of the measure. Depew matched his
wit with that of Bailey on the subject of
the American girl, and the sallies of the
two Senators were greeted with shouts oÂ£
laughter, both on the floor and in the gat
lerits. The Texan's keen reference to the
recent marriage of Depew was most hap
pily fenced by the New York Senator in
his reference to the love and admiration
excited in woman by "the youth and.
beauty" of Bailey. ; Â¦
At his own request. Colonel E. Van Ars
dale Andruss, Artillery Corps, has been
retired. He is from New Jersey.

from JklcCormlck's hands, belabored him
soundly on the hea.d with it. Â¦ Dazed by
the blows and still under, the Influence of

All Union Barbers of the Cap-

on Strike.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO. April 2.â The art of
shaving oneself Is gaining new devotees
daily, in view of the almost certain strike
of all the journeymen barbers in this
city. The breach betweenythe Master Bar
bers' Union and the Journeymen Barbers'
Union has widened to such an eitent that
both sides declare it cannot be bridged
and that a walkout is inevitable.
The trouble arose over a proposition to
keep the shops closed on Sundays. Thi3
was agreed to by the Master Barbers'
Union, representing the employers, and
an agreement was accordingly entered
into to this effect, in which it was pro
vided that the minimum rate of wages
should be $12 a week. The Journeymen's
Union afterward met and increased tha
minimum wage rate to $14. The master
barbers, many of whom were not desirous
of closing their shops on Sundays In any
event, declined to accept the new wage
rate and announced in positive terms that
they intended to keep open on Sundays
up to the noon hour. In the face of this
action the journeymen have announced
their -determination not to work on Sun
days on and after April 13, and they de
clare they will fight the employers to a
finish.

troduction:
"Whatever may be determined as to the

Kentucky wet goods follow the nag. Per

wherever* a plum hangs luscious on the
political tree there is an Ohio man ready,
able and willing. to reach out for it, and
that he generally gets it.
"The ubiquity of the Ohio man H
unique. He Is, indeed, everywhereâpar
ticularly in the civil offices. He so loves
his .country that he cannot bear to see
her affairs conducted by any one- except
himself. 'Take the wings of morning and

- Health ivill come with all its blessings to those -who know the way, and it is mainly a ques-
tion of right-living, with all the term implies, but the efforts which strengthen the system,
the games which refresh and the foods which nourish are important, each in a way, while it is
also advantageous to have knowledge of the best methods of promoting freedom from unsani-
tary conditions. To assist nature, when nature needs assistance, it is all important that the (
medicinal agents used should be of the best quality and of known value, and the one remedy
which acts most beneficially and pleasantly, as a laxative, isâ Syrup of Figsâ manufactured by â¢
the California Fig Syrup Co.
Â¦'''Â¦Â¦ With a proper understanding of the fact that many physical ill3 are of a transient char* .
acter and yield promptly to the gentle action of Syrup of Figs, gladness and comfort come to
the heart, and if one would remove the torpor and strain and congestion attendant upon a con-
stipated condition of the system, take Syrup of Figs and enjoy freedom from the aches and
pains, the~colds and headaches and the depression due to inactivity of the bowels. In case of
any organic trouble it is well to consult a competent physician, but when a laxative is required
remember that the most permanently gratifying results will follow personal cooperation with
the beneficial effects of Syrup of Figs. It is for sale by all reliable druggists. Price fifty
cents per bottle. , zL -*
The excellence of Syrup of Figs comes from the beneficial effects of the plants used in the
combination and also from the method of manufacture which ensures that perfect purity and
uniformity of product essential in a perfect family laxative. All the members of the family
from the youngest to the most advanced in years may use it whenever a laxative is needed and
share alike in its beneficial effects. We do not claim that Syrup of Figs is the only remedy of
known value, but it possesses this great advantage over all other laxatives that it acts gently
" and pleasantly without disturbing natural functions, in any way, as it is free from every ob-
jectionable quality oÂ» substance. To get its beneficial effects it is always necessary to buy the
genuine and the full name of the Co^-California Fig Syrup Co.â is printed on the front of every
package.

\ 718 Market Street and
; Con Powell and Eddy Streetsfirst crime In Judge Cook's
court yesterday. While awaiting sentence
for the robbery of Mrs. Ellen J. Foote,
the divorced -wife of General Lucius H.
Foote, on the night of December 28, 1901,
she consented to take the stand for the
prosecution and to testify against Thomas
Galvin, her alleged associate in the crime.
She told the etory of the robbery in a
plain, straightforward manner, but every
effort of the defense to extract from her
information as to the residence of her
family proved unavailing.
"I have a mother and sisters," she an
swered, "and I don't propose to tell you
where they live. I won't disgrace them."
Attorney Barrett, ,who represents Gal
vin, sought to obtain an answer with the
aid of the court, but Judge Cook declined,
WITHOUT a tremor. In her
voice, boldly and defiantly,
Anita Clark, a comely woman
of 21, told the story of her
Dr. Muller is a polished gentleman of
striking appearance. He wears the full
beard typical of the Free Staters.
I will be in America only a ehort time longer.
I came to California from Salt Lake City,
Â¦where I etopped off to interest the Mormons
in our cause. I spent much of my time in In
dianapolis, where much good work was accom
plished. I lectured at Harvard University sev
eral times and spoke in Boston olten. America
is a grand country â the best in the world â and
although I landed in California only two days'
ago I believe this is the grandest State in the
L'nion. With what I have seen of San Fran
cisco I am inclined to believe that I will like
It better than any city I have ever visited. I
â¢will travel all over the State, but will make
very brief stC2s.
The shooting of prisoners is inhuman. Com
mandant Scheepers. for instance, was shot be
cause be was wrecking trains. That is modern
warfare. A couEin of President Steyn was
shot the other day because he was captured
wearing a khaki uniform. We wear khaki uni
forms because we have no others. Most of our
clothing has been used up and when we capture
Britishers we take theirs.
Wanton Killing of- Captives.
This war trill do great harm to South Africa.
Even afterward it will be some time before
everything will be peaceful. It has brought
tremendous disadvantages to England in the
Tet East and has handicapped her. She can
not <3o anything, as her hands are tied, and
the conflict will last two or three years longer
at least. President Steyn and General Dewet
are disposed to fight it cut and both have as
fTteiJ to me that they will do it if only fifty
uicn are left in the field. My prediction is
that when the end does come, no matter which
Tray it coes. England will- be no better off.
I am not a young man. but I believe I will'
livp to see our freedom.
One vital point with us Is that we need doc
tors and need them badly. We have no more
doctors left. This fact has been known for
some time and we have had many applications
from private physicians to go to South Africa,
but they are not allowed to pass the English
lines. We want the United States to send Red
Cross doctors to us. Ever since 1SU4 it has
been a common custom in modern warfare for
all wounded to be attended, even though it had
to be done by the enemy's surgeons. In the
present struggle no interchange of doctors has
been allowed. Modern warfare is not murder.
It is to prevent by force another faction or
nation getting something it wishes to get and
which cannot be obtained by persuasion. The
Ia.ct of the English shooting prisoners is an
other subject for civilization to deal with. The
Boers always turn English prisoners loose and
they get a Back of tobacco, too, when they go.
We take their rifles and ammunition and some
times their uniforms. They are always well
treated. In consequence they will surrender
many times. There is one regiment that has
surrendered no less than five times, until now it
has been nicknamed "Dewet's Own."
The Enfflish are a fine people and it is a pity
that they have been led into this war. 1 be-
UevÂ«? thpy arc sorry it was ever etarted. They
would like to see it stopped %k>w, but their
pride urges them to cee it to the end. The
Boer war Is by no means at an end and will
not Yjc for e^veral years. Why. it has only
lasted two and a naif years- now and' look
whax a loss it has beefa to England ! You Amer
icans fought seven and a half years to gain
your liberty but you finally obtained it. Tour
cause at issue was your all and so it is with
us. The loss to Great Britain of America was
a far greater loss than South Africa could
ever be.
Britons Weary of the War.
SAN RAFAEL, April 2.â Dr. Hendrik
Muller, envoy of the Orange Free State,
is in California for the first time and is
visiting William Bug in this city. Dr.
Lfuller has been in America since the first
cf the year and is here in the interest of
the Boer cause. He has visited most of
the principal cities in the United States
and has addressed many large assem
blages throughout the country. When he
first arrived in the country the doctor
traveled incognito in order to the more
easily become familiar with the ways of
the American people as well as be con
vinced of their feeling toward the Boers.
The preponderance of public sentiment in
favor of his people was so evident that
Dr. Muller soon had no hesitation In de
claring himself. He visited President
Roosevelt and had several conferences
with him. and also conferred with Sec
retary Hay. # Dr. Muller said to-night:
I am here solely in the interest of the Boers.
I am from the Oranse Free State and it is
my first visit to your country. I came here
net to denounce the British, not to ask the
aid or mediation of the United States, or to
discourse harrowing tales of the oppression of
our unfortunate people, but simply to give
to the people of this country conservative in
formation in regard to the status of affairs at
the o*>at of war and enlighten them as to the
niciits cf our cause.

that on discovering she had so mu^ii

"His resignation took effect on April 1.
I presume that the letter to which he re
fers is the one I wrote to the clergyman
of. that diocese who sought my advice.
The Bishop was attempting to get him
out of the church and I advised him to
call upon the civil law to sustain his
rights. A clergyman may always claim
legal protection from a tyrannical Bishop.
â¢We have sent Bishop Nichols of Califor
nia to act in Hawaii until the next meet
ing of the House of Bishops, when we
shall elect a Bishop of Hawaii."
"The worthy Bishop of Honolulu," he
!Â« quoted, as saying, "must be out of hl3
jiind. This is the kindest interpretation
to put upon his conduct. When Hawaii
â¢was annexed it became at once apparent
to every one but him that the Episcopal
church there must pass from British to
American control. It was of course ex
pected that he would resign. We learned
to our surprise that the Bishop intended
to remain. The church was theoretically
under the care of the Archbishop of Can
terbury, but the Archbishop actually did
not have power to remove the Bishop.
The Bishop's salary was paid by the So
ciety for the Promotion of the Gospel in
Foreign Lands, which served notice x>n
him that his salary would be stopped in
six months. . ' Â¦
Bishop Potter was quoted by an after
noon paper to-day as giving an explana
tion of the situation in Honolulu.
"Should this fail of realization," writes
Bishop Willis, "the cause of the failure
will be the unholy, uncanonical interfer
ence of the Bishop of New York, whose
letter to the clergyman in this diocese has
been published, urging him to take legal
proceedings against the Bishop (Willis)
for no other purpose than to prevent the
allegiance we have already promised to
your branch of the church going inta
eftect."
. The Honolulu correspondent of an aft
ernoon newspaper has sent an open let
ter, in which Bishop Willis, writing lo
Bishop Dudley of Kentucky, says that he
has been in his position for thirty years
and that when there were disturbances
on account of the transfer of the Islands
to the United States he did all he could
to promote unity.
NEW YORK, April 2.â Bishop Willis,
who looked after the interests of the
Anglican church in Hawaii, has at last

are tied up and over 3000 .men rendered
idle, with the prospects that as soon as
the supply of ore has been exhausted, the
smelters will be closed down and thou
sands of men will be thrown out of

ANACONDA, April 2.â The Anaconda
and Washoe concentrators were closed
down at 11 o'clock to-night, throwing
about 1500 men out of employment. This
action was made necessary by the strike
of the hoisting engineers of the Amalga

a limited supply of ore; enough, it is
thought, to last two or three days, when
they, too, will be forced to suspend, throw

advance of 10 per cent, accompanied by
a notice that if not granted its operatives
would refuse to. work arter Saturday,

- 1% Is . probable that Washington " leaders,
though not Informed of all the. details of Cal
ifornia politics, have observed | several facts,
viz: First, the three leading Republican papers
of California â The Call and Chronicle of San
Francisco and the Times of, Los Angeles â are
bitterly opposed to the renomination of Gage;
secondly, a majority. of the, Republican papers
which stand In the second class, such as the
San Jose Mercury and Fresno-- Republican, to
mention but two out of half ~ a dozen, are
equally opposed to the Governor's renomina
tion; thirdly, the contest has taken on the
aspect of a machine and anti-machine fight.
This antagonism between an organization and
public opinion is nothing new, the situation be
ing repeated from time to time In many States
but wherever It may be found It Is ' a bad
condition for a political party to get Into and
It Is not strange If the national leaders In
Washington, who care nothing about either
faction In our State politics, but who desire
party success, should be somewhat alarmed.
The supporters of Governor Gage admit that
theÂ» antagonism exists, and when they, are
candid they confess that the Governor cannot
hope to : poll the entire . Republican vote but
Ft 1 11 they insist that he will be elected, if re
nomlnated. because they believe he will get
a lot of Â¦ Democratic 'Â¦ votes. This is a claim
which Is uncertain at best, and s even : If It
should be allowed It . would not ; Improve I the
situation for the rest of the ticket. When: a
party becomes demoralized * through Internal
dissensions the common result Is the abstention
from . voting of many party members, and it
is easy to see what this means. Supposing
that Governor Gage should: repel a large frac
tion of the Republican voters, who would stay
away . from ; the polls on election day, < and
should . attract enough Democratic- voters:, to
give him a plurality, and elect him; the Dem
ocrats who . would vote for Gage for Governor
would be. very unlikely to vote for the rest
of the Republican State ticket or to go for
Republican members of the Legislature. .They
would' follow. their party in these matters, and
the consequences would be the possible election
of: a : Democratic State' ticket andv a": Demo
cratic I^jlslature."i r^^cSirafeÂ»flHSBSi*iJWSfN3^fl3fl' t fi

One of the most shameful acts of Governor

affairs is the appointment, a few days ago.
of "Johnny" Mackenzie of San Jose an a Har
bor Oommifeloner at San Francisco. The term
ts for four years and the salary is $3000 a year.
The position Is one requiring honesty; energy
nnd business and executive ability of a high
order. To his credit be it said Mr. Mackenzie
cever has made any pretense of assuming any
of these attributes. He has been content to be
merely a local ward heeler, then a city political
toss in San Jose, contenting himself and his
followers with such pluckings from the tax
payers as might be had from time to time
through the City Council and the Board of
Education. Lately he has aspired to control
Santa Clara County, which has long vied with
San Francisco as a hotbed of political chi
canery. But Governor Gage, grasping des
perately at every apparent chance to strengthen
his machine, throws all sentiments &l honor,
decency and propriety to the winds. He is
determined to secure a renomination to the
high office which he has so steadily disgraced,
and his appointment of Mackenzie la an Indica
tion that he will scruple at nothing In the fur
therance of hlÂ» schemes to fasten himself and
his political pr-rasltes upon the people of Cali
fornia for another four years. If by any In
excusable mischance the pledge-breaking Gage
should be returned to the executive office | at
Sacramento the unspeakable Dan Burns . would
again be found reaching out and clutching with
his unclean hands at the Senatorial toga. Do
the voters of California want a repetition of
that sickening drama? .
San Diego Tribune:
, In view- of such a prospect it .was positively
cruel for the H. H. . I* push to Induce thÂ«s
Governor to turn: down the labor unions' can
didate for Superior Judge. Ever, since Mr
Gage gave. the push such a bad Jolt in the mat
ter of the - appointment of Â¦ managers of the
Stockton State. Hospital, the local machine has
been waiting for-a chance to hit back If tlie
appointment of Mr. - Buck as Superior Judre
causes the , introduction of. some squeaky notes
into the melodious rhapsody which the GovÂ»r
nor's; chief musicians are -preparing â¢ to -ren(IÂ»r
under the- title, '.'Who Ended: the Strike?'!
many local Republicans will be delighted with
the discord," and If that Â¦ appointment should
result In the. retirement of the chief executive
to the quietof his' Los Angeles home the II
H.Mi. push will be almost as happy as It would
be If the editor of the Independent 'should hep
pen not "to get , the i Stockton , postof flee. Â¦ Â¦'Â¦:
â¢." Now, If there is one thing more than another
which Governor Gage desires to have: pro
claimed from the housetops -it is that he is
a friend of the labor unions. Didn't he settle
the great strike in San Francisco? â¢ Just how
much . he did for i the ;. laboring t men In s that
affair . will \ probably hot be j known .-until his
partisans begin- to reveal great' mysteries of
state upon the stump after the Governor has
been renomlnated. Then the other men who
have Â¦ been fancying that they - had - something
to do with bringing that great contest to an
end will find out that ; they were mere puppet3
In the hands of Henry T. Gage, .who mesmer
ized . the Employers' Association into - giving
tlie , strikers their positions again. When it
comes to telling how much the laboring men
got out of the settlement, beyond the privilege
of going' to -work again, as a; result of"the
Governor's intervention, we. - may expect â¢ some
modest ; statements on the part of the Gage
orators, Â¦ but there , is no doubt that ' the Gov
ernor's part In the settlement of the San Fran
cisco Btrike will be one of .the principal themes
to inspire those who are. getting, their bugles
ready to sound his praises in the coming cam
paign.- Â¦. !.. N Â¦. â¢ â¢ v /Â¦.' 'Â¦ .- â¢ : ' ..... ..;-
- While no one can say a word against the
Intellectual and - professional qualifications of
Judge Buck for the distinguished office to
which he has been appointed, lit is well known
that the labor unions had a decided preference
for Mr. Fairall and a I decided antipathy for
Mr. Buck. ";â¢Â¦ . Â¦ . â ,
' Governor Gage was probably very much sur
prised when he learned Â¦ the â¢ facts brought out
by the Mall yesterday in regard to the way In
which the H. H. L.. push tricked him In the
matter of the appointment of a Superior Judge
for this county. It has been a long time since
the push carried a scheme to a successful ter
mination, and the Mail takes pleasure In con
gratulating the organization upon the fact that
its right hand has not forgotten its cunning
nor has its tongue cleaved Uo the roof, of Its
mouth. Life in Stockton without the push
would be Improved in some respects, but it
would Â¦ lose much of its excitement.
Stockton Mail:
B.y . the appointment 'â¢ of Mackenzie of â¢ ' San
Jose for Harbor Commissioner Governor Gage
has incurred the displeasure of a very large
number of the leading Republican papers , of

pointment that ihe Governor has betrayed him
self and the Republican party into the hands
of the boss element. The San Francisco Call
and the 'Los. Angeles Times - are among" the

The great body of Republicans say no. Their
party is representative of the county, and they
do not propose to permit a handful of manipu
lators to make it appear that a mob represents
the party, or that It is under the dictatorship
of corrupt men. The Republican party is not
corrupt, in spite of the appearance of corrup
tion given It Saturday; Its leaders are not cor
rupt. In spite of the assumed leadership of
corrupt men. The great body of Republicans
are not corrupt, they despise corruption; they
stand for good citizenship and for the best in
terests of their city, their State and their coun
try, and fcr this reason will not follow the lead
of hoodlums, placed in undeserved power by
hoodlum methods. These hoodlums have
brought confusion upon the Republican party
of this valley, a condition which local Repub
licans can and will correct. .â¢- -a.
The majority of Saturday's meeting was not
representative of the Republican party of Santa
Clara County, no more than the inmates of the
County Jail are representative or its citizen
ship. They can yell, however, and carefully
coached and under the leadership of designing
knaves their yells can silence In a small room
the voices of better men, but is the voice of
the Republican party of Santa Clara Valley
to be lost In the yells of hoodlums?
Thanks to the activities of John D. Macken
zie and the lieutenants who do his bidding the
Republican party of Santa Clara' County is in
a condition bordering upon chaotic. Saturday's
meeting of the Santa Clara County Republican
League but increased the disorder, and unless
the course of the disturbers be stayed and Its
cause removed the handsome majority of over
2U0U that the party had in this county is des
tined to be wiped cut. The question before the
Republicans of this valley is: Are you to suf
fer party defeat at the hands of spoilsmen who
have made the party machinery of this com
munity a by- word?
San Jose Herald:
Ontario Record Observer:
One of the best Informed men in Central
California writes that . "there is going to be
a fight over the Republican Â¦ nomination for
Governor which may beat the Republican party
next fall; it will surely be beaten If Gage Is
nominated." And the Pomona Times adds:
."Every Republican . on . principle wants his
party to win in the coming election, but there
are thousands of Republicans on principle who
would welcome defeat with Gage the nominee
for Governor." ; "
And It must be said that this Is not simply
the sentiment of one or two men, or any little
clique of men who may have become dis
gruntled at eome fancied wrong. It is the
prevailing sentiment,, all through this end of
the State. Gage at the ' head of the ticket
this fall will swamp the party. The rank anil
file will have none^of him â they have had too
much already and simply will not stand it any
longer. ' Â¦ , Â¦
Locally there seems to be no strong sentiment
in favor of any particular man, but you can
not go out on the street and find one man in
ten who will say he wants another term of
Gageism. The Republican party Is patient and
long-suffering in many respects, but it will
not ptand another four years like the past in
this State.,
Give x\b a "man" for a leader or there will
be no . followers. . . ,
It is coldly a question of good Republican
politics, 'about which there should ! not be any
honest differences of opinion â this question of
California's choice for Governor. A vast ma
jority of the better element of the Republican
party is not with the Burns-Gaze push. We
want no more machine-made Governors; no
more autocratic demagogues and bitter par
tisans. - And this kind of a Governor we will
not have If- Burns and his henchmen can be
prevented from subverting and demoralizing the
Republican State organization.
Lodi Herald:
The mere mention of the name Bernard D.
Murphy as a probable candidate for Governor
on the -Democratic ticket has caused a flutter
among the Gage supporters. The fact of near
ly one-half the Republican papers in the State
condemning Gace has maSe no impression, so
there must be something in the name of VBar
ney" Murphy. Mr. Murphy was before, the
convention that nominated James .Budd : for
Governor and made quite a lively race for the
place. ':â¢Â¦'-. . â¢ . . *_â¢ '

Judging from present indications there will
be many strange alliances this year. There is
no disguising the fact that the Examiner will
be behind Gage In the next fight â or, at least,
as long as Gage has a possible show of win
ning* At the last election in San Francisco
the Examiner at the inception of the cam
paign came out for Tobln, the Democratic can
diate. for Mayor. Then its support got luke
warm,^ drifted to the frigid mark, then ceased
altogether. The so-called "monarch of all the
dallies" twigged the move that the Labor
Union candidate Schmitz flood the best chance
of winning and directed Its policy accordingly.
The Examiner started Tobin and
concluded by taking the biggest slice of praise
for electing Schmitz.
Auburn Republican:
â¢. The Examiner says Prepton Is the Spreckels
candidate for ' the Republican nomination for
Governor. If this be true, it means aspllt in
the- opposition to Gage in the south. The op
position to Gage Is likely to have trouble In the
San Joaquln Valley, too. Short's friends seem
determined to send a delegation favorable to
him from this county and there will undoubt
edly . be Short men In the delegations . from
other valley counties. Short is very friendly
with Gaste â he has ' stated, in fact, that he
would not be a "candidate against him â so it is
not -likely that his followers will go over, to
Flint If they see there is no chance for. Short.
The opinion is growing here that neither Gage
nor Flint will ba nominated.
Fresno Mirror:
Governor Gage has been diligently digging
his own political grave for three years, and
when he appointed John D. Mackenzie for Har
bor Commissioner he fell into it. Next fall the
people will gently cover him over and- write
for his epitaph: "Peace be to his ashes. May
we never see hie like again."

as Buck is on the blacklist of the Federated
Trades In that city. It is further claimed that
Gage's blunder Is all' the more serious for the
reason that he is said to have promised the
appointment to C. H. Falrali, attorney for the
Federated Trades, and also to ex-Judge Ansel
Smith. The Governor's plans have been to cur
ry favor with labor organizations - wherever
possible, but this blunder, it is claimed will
not help his cause with the laboring classes."
r A dispatch. from Sacramento says: "It ap
pear* that Governor Gage has been handed a
delicately gilded briquette by his political ene
mies in Stockton by appointing George F. Buck
to fill the unexplred term of the late Superior
Judge Budd of San Joaquln County. ! The ap
pointment was made last night upon the recom
mendation, it is said, of Alexander Brown,
chairman of the State Board of Equalization,
â¢who went to Stockton to feel the public pulse
there regarding the preference for the sev
eral aspirants for the position. The story
comes from Stockton that the appointment was
made to placate Dr. Harkness, chairman of the
County Central Committee;. Orrln Henderson,
chairman of the Board of Supervisors and ex-
Congressman J. A. Louttlt, who have been
particularly active and bitter in their opposi
tion to the Governor. . . ' â¢
Martinez Daily Press:
Senator W. M. Cutter, secretary of the Re
publican State Central Committee, has gone
back to- his . stenographic . work in Marysville,
saying he would enter the fight for re-election
aa.Sta-te Senator. . Seemingly his visit, to San
Francisco convinced â¢ him that the anti-Gage
element would overlook him in his guberna

Before he went, however, Cutter declared him
self in warm words against- the. renomination
of Gage, and he is going to fight In the State
Central Committee against, the appointment. of

Marysville Democrat:

there was two years ago, when the same boeees

If honest Republicans are prepared to' make
the shameful admission that a corrupt ring of
tricky political bosses can dictate this nomina
tion against the opposition of the decent ele
ment of the party, then let the latter give up
the fight, hold its nose and permit the ringsters
to do their work, which will give California a
Democratic Govrmcr. But if the rank and file
of the Republican party are not willing to con
cede any such disgraceful weakness, it is time
they were up and doing. The Gage gang has
not yet "fixed" things for him. but it is show
ing a pernicious activity in strengthening the
machine all over the State. It Is not too late
for the party to b*at the bosses and avert dis
aster; it will be too late when the ring has
fastened Us tentacles on Â£very county and
bound the party hand and foot.
it is quite unnecessary to give in detail the
reasons why the renomination of Governor
Gage, even if it were possible to re-elect him,
would be a mistake. Every intelligent Repub
lican is familiar with them. No Governor ever
chosen in California has so shamelessly be*
trayed the confidence of those who supported
him as has Henry T. Gage. When he was
tlected there were men of his party who, while
confident that his administration would be a
clean one, uere inclined to doubt whether it
v.ould be particularly strong. They were not
<3Uite certai4ttbat a practitioner at the criminal
Las, however successful in his long career in
that not veVy enviable calling, would necessari
ly have tlie qualifications requisite for the ex
ecutive of a great State. But whatever mis
givings there may have been on that score, no
body ior an instant imagined that, once in
otSce. Mr.- Gore would turn his back on his
pledges, throw" himself into the arms of the
most notoriously corrupt political ringsters and
obsequiously obey the behests of the hired men
of the great corporations that do politics In
California. All this Mr. (Jage has done, and
more. And noir. utterly indifferent to the sen
timents of the decent members of his party â
and they are in overwhelming majority â he
purposes to force upon them his renomination,
and he seeks to commit this outrage through
the same ur.clean instruments with which he
has coEEOited ever sinct- he took office. It re
mains to be seen whether Henry T. Gage and
his malodorous machine are stronger than the
llepublican party of California.
Henry T. Gage cannot again be elected Gov
ernor of California. The question that \ now
confronts honest Republicans Is: Will the po
litical machine, of which he is an Important
part, prove strong enough to force his renomi
nation and bring disaster to the party? And
this is an issue that cannot be faced too- soon.
San Diego Union:
It is not a matter for marvel that news
paper gentlemen comfortably ensconced In'
postoffices should not find much to criticize In
existing political methods. There never was.
a reform of any sort inaugurated by sleek,
well fed and prosperous gentlemen who are
sleek, well fed and prosperous by virtue of the
good office of some political patron. Never
theleEs. and despite the semi-conscious condi
tion of a portion of the political press, the
politics of. California. Republican as well as
Democratic, Is founded on confoundadly low
ideals of civic virtues and are susceptible of
being improved. Personally, Henry T. Gage
is a cleaner and a better man than James H.
Budd of questionable notoriety, but his poli
tical methods are little If any higher. He Is
a push politician and has filled public offices
with much the same breeds of political cattle
that mussed the stalls under the regime of
his predecessor. It ' Is true enough that Re
publicans have no occasion to apologize to
Democrats because of such appointments be
cause we have been treated to years of Demo
cratic precedent of the same quality, but the
Republican conscience of California is strenu
ously opposed to the push political
which Governor Gage has been pleased to em
ploy, and desires to give California an admin
istration upon a higher political plane. Now
that we have a Republican National admin
istration of an unwonted elevation of political
ideals, it would be an opportune time to af
ford California just such another if the . right
man to lead It can be found. Henry T.' Gage
is not the man the better element of the party
is looking for.

The Ga?e organs are Â¦worried over the Gov
ernor's indifference, not to say hostility, to
the agricultural interests of the State, espe
cially with reference to his refusal to approve
a fertilizer bill passed by a large majority of
the Legislature, and favored by the brightest
and most successful fruit growers In the

five are better fitted to be Governor than
Gage.

would welcome defeat with Gage the nominee
for Governor.
Pomona Times:
One of the best informed men In Central
California writes that "there Is going to be a
fight over the Republican nomination for Gov
ernor which may beat the Republican party
next fall; it wiU eurcly be beaten If Gage la
nominated."
Gage took weeks to make up his mind In tha
matter and obviously In the appointment has
done what he considers the best for Gage But
it requires no political sage to figure out that
the Governor has materially injured himself.
So far as San Joaquln Is concerned, it matters
litttle, for the Governor stood no chance of se
curing any help from this section of the State,
but the appointment has been made note of
elsewhere, and the enemies of Gage will use it
against him . effectively. It will serve as an
illustration to show Just how far -petty poli
tics dictate the Governor's actions. It will be
an object lesson that will Impress itself upon
the people. . . â¢ â¢.
The Governor's attitude in the matter would
ba reprehensible under any circumstanced, and
in connection with any appointment, but it is
all the more so in the matter of a judicial
position, which should be as far removed from
political influence as possible. . .
The degree to which the scheming politician
overshadows the statesman in - the- Governor's
makeup is well exemplified in this particular
Instance. The Governor listened eagerly to all
sorts of overtures which might redound to his
political benefit. In fact, he was frank to a
dogrco In his talks with those who went to see
him in connection with the appointment. He
bluntly wanted to know what they could do
for Gage.
In the ' character or judicial qualifications of
the man appointed the people have . no just
grounds for. complaint. But they have cause
for indignation and shame in the' Influences
which controlled the Governor In making an
appointment. Legal attainments, judicial qual
ifications, personal character, integrity, were
all weighed in the balance as against political
influence and found wanting in the Governor's
scales. â¢ ....... .. . .- . . :
After weeks of delay, with his ear close to
the ground to catch the faintest tick of wire
less political influence, - Governor Gage has
made the appointment of Superior Judge in
San Joaquln County to succeed the late Judge
Budd.

Alameda Argus:
A virile writer In the Stockton Mall thinks
that Tirey L. Ford Is the coming leader of

Is one that is not so very unreasonable. Ford
is of the better class of politicians. He has
been favored with a high and responsible of
fice, and has made good. There is something
to him. The great syndicate which purchased
the Market-street railway system found In him
the man they wanted to look out for their
Important Interests. If Ford should desire to
take a leading part in the campaign he would
not be likely to find much difficulty In break-

lead to his present elimination from local af
fairs. ' . ' ' . - v :
THE leading Republican newspapers of California are decidedly opposed to the renomination of Governor Gage.
In truth Gage has very. few supporters outside of the office-holding brigade of the State. Most of the talk in
his favor comes from Democratic programmers, who sincerely hope that his nomination will be forced on the Re
publican party by the railroad push and the boss machine. Nearly all of the leading Republican speakers who were
foremost in the State campaign of 1898, when Gage was at the head of the ticket, are against his nomination
for another term. Gage has " contemptuously treated many prominent Republicans who gave their best efforts to
win the victory for the party in 1898. He regarded the party's victory in that campaign as his . own personal tri
umph. He sought the first opportunity to offend U. S. Grant Jr., and went out of his way to insult Senator
Perkins at the San Pedro celebration, where the Senator was a guest of the county in which- the Governor re
sides. It is true that the Senator is not the biggest or broadest-minded statesman that the State has ever produced,
but in contrast with the Governor he looms' up. Gage was so chagrined over the defeat of Burns that he could
not show the scant courtesy of attending Senator Bard's reception at the Golden Eagle Hotel, Sacramento. There
surely is a widespread, all around impression that Gage is too small a man for the high office of Governor of
California. The talk of his supporters about his independence and firmness of character is nothing but cheap
laudation. He did not have the firmness to resist pressure or the independence to assert his own judgment when
Burns insisted that Mackenzie should be appointed to the post of Harbor Commissioner
Here is what some of the leading newspapers say of Gage:
Napa Eegister:
Assemblyman Melick of Pasadena gave sev
eral columns of space in his News the other
day to a review of the administration of Gov
ernor Gage. He aims at an Impartial presen
tation of facts and does not omit giving credit
v.-hure he thinks credit Is due. but he says:
â¢â¢Juet so sure as Governor Gape's renomination
is forced by the aid of boss rule, so sure will
the Republican party be defeated at the polls."

In discussing the work before the committee and
the State Board of Trade 1 President Chipman said at
the meeting on Tuesday :, "There are fifty organized
counties, north of the . Teliadjapi Mountains/Every
one of these counties shpuUT be shown the impor
tance to it of affiliating with the Cali
fornia' State Board of Trade.. : There is not. a
county in the entire group that. diJes not offer some
inducement to the homeseeker, or'does not desire tb ;
reinforce its population and capital, or that has not
one or more industries that may attract the immi
grant or the capitalist.. And yet it must be admitted
that the naturar resources and attractions of many of
these counties are as yet but little known outside of
their, borders."
The enthusiasm with which the movement has
been started, the rapidity with which it lias grown
from comparatively small beginnings to its present
magnitude, and the character of .the men who have
consented to advance it, not only by, contributions of
money but by serving it actively, ought to be enough
to assure even the most skeptical that a golden op
portunity is now afforded the /people of Northern
California to begin a new .era in the history- of the
development of the rich resources of their counties,
and to promote all their industrial enterprises Every
county where the people are desirous of achieving
"big things" within the immediate future should be
represented in the movement. Not one can afford to
stand aside and leave it for some neighboring county
to do the work. It-is a time when the principle of
one for all and. all for one should be applied as a
matter of business as well as of sentiment.
â¢During the discussion of the financial prospects of
the organization it was stated that what is desired is
not a large contribution at first, but an assurance of
regular monthly contributions, so tljat the directors
may know what revenues they will have to count on
in carrying the work forward. Trie monthly income
need not be large, but it ought to be certain.
WITH the election ' of Andrea Sbarboro,
president, and T. C. Friedlander, secretary,
and the appointment of the necessary com
mittees, the organization of the body which, in con
nection with the State Board of Trade, is to take
charge of the work of promoting the interests of
Northern California has been' completed. The next
step is to provide the revenues required for the suc
cess of the undertaking, and that should not be diffi
cult of accomplishment.
PROMOTION AND PROGRESS.
in American cities the nuisance is the more danger
ous by reason of the highly, inflammable .materials of
which the fences.are constructed and. ; the) liability of
the ordinary American building ;Â¦ to catch fire. Every
high wooden fence is a distinct menace to the com-;
munity, as well as being unsightly in itself and a place
upon whiclKto, display- posters 'that are more un
sightly-still. .San Francisco suffers from the nuisance
as "'much as iif- not more than the average ;Ameri
can city, and it is. therefore highly important to abate
it at ; once. There should be no grant of two years',
freedom to. commit what is recognized as anevil by
the very ordinance itself. There may be differences
of opinion asto the. best means of suppressing nui
sances,-hut there should be none as to the time "when
the suppression^ should take ; place.
The issue involved in the restriction of high. fences
is one of the most serious that now confronts Amer
ican municipalities. In well, nigh every city in the
Union an agitation for the suppression of the nui
sance has been going- on for some! time. V In many
cities fairly satisfactory ordinances â¢ have been
adopted, and some of the worst evils, abated. Still
even in the communities that are best regulated in
this regard there remains much to be done. A' similar
condition prevails in some parts of Em ope, so that
the fight against high ' fences, 'dangerous â¢ signs,
hideous bill-posting and other forms of this nuisance
is almost as wide as Civilization. ; The one country
that seems to have found a ; completely satisfactory
method ; of dealing with it is France, where a graded
tax is imposed upon all poster advertising. '.That
method, brings^ the whole subject under supervision
and. provides for. its proper regulation.'; . ;.
ONCE more the Supervisors are engaged m an
effort to provide a means of abating the high
fence nuisance. Two ordinances ' designed
for that purpose have been passed to print. One of
them, however, m-ight be more correctly termed an
ordinance to continue the nuisance, for under pre
tense of conserving the, interests of- bill posters it
postpones the operation of the provisions against the
nuisance for two -years/ By that sort of compromise
the men who profit by the eyil would get liberty to
continue it until some time in 1904, and then of
course they could, come in and make a fight, or a
plea 'for a further continuance.

In a recent lecture on "Russian Expansion" Profes
sor Grosvenor of Amherst said: "Nations, like in
dividuals, have instinct, and the instinct of a nation
never errs; as a plant turns to the sun, so does a
nation stretch out toward the sea." Then, reviewing
the progress made by Russia toward the sea, he said:
"No other country has been so conspicuously an
evolutionary country. She has waged many wars,
wars of conquest and wars ending in defeat, but
whatever the results of these collisions with the rest
of the world, she has gone on steadily expanding and
as steadily absorbing. She, has grown great not by
wars, but by quietly yielding in an emergency; and
later, when the crisis was passed, doing the thing
which a preceding generation found it impossible to
do. In i860 she obtained full claim to the' western
bank of the Amur without firing a shot."
When due consideration is given to the course of
Russian history and the practice of Russian states
men, in contrast to the merely verbal opposition of
the advocates of the open door, it will appear that in
agreeing that China may have a free hand in Man
churia "after evacuation," the Russian Minister has
given .the Chinese Foreign Office a very large and
very slightly gilded gold brick.
Russian diplomacy is not likely to be disturbed by
a mere academic opposition to her advance in China.
Moreover, her statesmen are not likely to commit
the blunder of committing an act which would pro
voke war. They know how to wait. The past ex
perience of their onward march across Asia has
shown them that by exercising patience and trusting
to time opportunities will come to them to attain
quite peaceably many advantages that were once de
nied them under a threat of war. It is that fact that
gives so much significance to the Czar's desire for
peace. His empire is growing more rapidly than that
oT any other European sovereign. Peaceful aggran
dizement is more advantageous to him than any pos
sible war could be. All that Russia netds is peace
and time. Given these and it is an easy prediction
that in the course of another generation the mighty
empire, secure within its vast territory, can defy the
world about as safely as the United States herself.
Germany will not antagonize Russia. Austria and
Italy, the other parties to the Dreibund, will doubt
less follow German lead. France is the ally of Rus
sia. Great Britain and Japan, while allied in defense
of their mutual interests in China, are not likely to
interfere so far as to attempt to force Russia put of
the positions she already occupies. The United
States will be equally conservative. Such being the
situation, how long will it be before the Russian
evacuation takes place?
It was announced from Washington not long ago
.that just before the visit of Prince Henry to this
country the State Department sounded Germany as
to how far she would go in maintaining the "open
doof" in China. The inquiry was not made as a mere
.formal interchange of views, but was intended to
Â¦elicit a clear presentation of what might be expected
of Germany in case ~ny nation should assert exclu
sive possession or control over any "part of Chinese
territory. It is reported to have resulted "in obtain
ing from the very head of the German empire the im
pression that Germany, while willing to take an iden
tical attitude with the other powers for the open
door, would not in final instance oppose anything
that- -Russia really desires. This is the first principle
of Germany's exterior policy, and it applies fully to
the East Asian question."
A DISPATCH from Peking announces that the
Manchurian convention recently agreed upon
by the Russian Minister to Qiina and the Chi
nese Foreign Office piovides that China may miin
tain whatever force she deems necessary in' Man
churia "after the Russian evacuation of that prov
ince." As the dispatch is dated April i, this would
.be regarded as something of an April fool joke were
it not that diplomacy is always serious. It is now
for the nations to guess at the time when Russia
will evacuate and China be permitted to resume con
trol of the disputed territory.

The people are sober-minded. iThey bear much

;But' all- this is /disagreeable to the militant Fun
ston. He has an opinion, and all Americans, no mat
ter of what 'eminence, who do not .agree with him
should be hanged. What./- could/ better illustrate
Taft's regret that we had anything at all to do with
the Philippines? If, in. addition to the delicate and
difficult issue's in the islands, which in their solution
call for all patience and : all wisdom, and,' above all,
for.a united sentiment at home, we encourage officers
of the army like Funston to insult the very class of
our citizens whose assistance is most desirable, ( we
have not only the vexations that are upon the islands,
but have taken into our : body politic at home. an
issue of the most serious nature. do not need
to indorse nor repudiate the petition itself. "That is
not in issue. The question raised by Funston is the
right of Americans to petition their Government
without the consent of the army. â¢
1 That is the. reasonable ...larigluage. of a patriotic
American, who. soberly/, contemplates a grave duty. 1
It is a declaration that, brings us 1 - all. together, united

Philippine affair given , under 'oath | to the Senate
committee by Governor Taft, -President McKinley's

form to entrap Aguinaldo he violated the articles of
war. ?We are perfectly aware that a civilian must
tread softly 'about the . articles of war, and the East
ern press of all parties! which has criticized Funston
omitted to do if stocking-footed. But, recurring to
his remarks, the General says that everything is fair
in war except the use' of .poison and the misuse of
the -flag ,of truce, and he adds "that, anyway, "only
four.;of Â¦my. -men wore^ the enemy's uniform, and the
rest : were dressed as Filipino peasants." - '

â¢It is against that machine and the schemes that the
machine supports" that the. press <jf both parties is
now protesting. While the issue concerns the whole
people of the State, it is especially ;a matter of con
cern to the Republican ' party, 'since the plan of the
allied bosses is to use the Republican convention to
renominate their candidate.* The rank and file of the
party are called upon to combat and defeat that in
famy. Gage cannot be re-elected, and the Republican
party should not be exposed to the disaster his xe
nomination will render inevitable.. *
Never before has the spoils system of. politics been
carried so far in California. Gage has hardly left a
single State institution or department of the admin
istration free from the control of the railroad hench
men. Even the Normal Schools and the charitable
institutions of the commonwealth have been made
subject to the greed of corrupt politicians. # By these
unscrupulous tactics Gage has enabled Herrin to
build up a formidable machine in both parties, and
men pretending to be Republicans are working in
combination with men pretending to be Democrats
to bring about the re-election of the man who has
made the Governorship of California an office for the
distribution of patronage to the .railroad bosses and
thus enable Billy Herrin to pay his hirelings out of
the State treasury instead of out of the railroad treas
ury. â¢ . Â¦Â¦''.,
No man ever entered upon the office of Governor
of California with better opportunities for: rendering
high service to the State than. Gage, and no other
man in that office ever so abused his opportunities
or mocked at the expectations of the people. The
settlement of the claims of the Government against
the railroad closed the long controversy, over 'the
railroad debt and left the road no further reason for
active participation in California politics. There was
then a chance for the ; elimination of railroad inr
fluences from political affairs. Had the .Governor
been fair and honest in his pledges to the people
he could have put the railroad and its Democratic
boss out of politics altogether, for there was not a
single issue before the Legislaturesthat gave the rail
road any excuse whatever for sending a lobby to
Sacramento, or in any way interfering with legislat
tion. Gage, however, made an opening for the' rail
road. He joined with it in striving to force the'elec
tion of Burns to the Senate, and since that time4iad
done his best to build up the railroad political ma
chine by giving Billy Herrin virtual control of all
State patronage. .. . '.'.-.
It is gratifying to note that against this shameless
campaign for plunder nearly the whole press of the
State has risen in protest.' Notwithstanding the fact
that Billy Herrin is a Democrat, the majority of the
Democratic press of the State refuses to accept. his
man Gage as an aspirant for the Governorship, arid
notwithstanding Gage pretends to be a Republican,
the strength of the Republican press repudiates his
pretensions and denounces him as a political tool of
the bosses of both parties, but the representative of '
neither. -.
WI^EN Governor Gage was a candidate.be
fore the people he was loud in declaring he
had no alliance with the railroads nor with
the bosses who do politics for the spoils. The people
believed him and he was elected. Â¦ Scarcely had hel
taken his seat than he showed himself an ally of
Herrin in an effort to bully the Republicans of/ the
Legislature into the election of Dan Burns to ..the
United States Senate. Since that time he has never
tried to conceal the falseness of the pretensions and
pledges upon which he made his first campaign, and
now he is a candidate for re-election as the open and
avowed tool of the bosses, the advocate of the spoils
system, ready to ally himself with Democrats of the
stripe of Billy Herrin, or Republicans of the type of
Martin Kelly, so long as he may share with them the
spoils of corruption.

Annual Session.
command of Captain Joseph Kennedy,
will give a fancy drill, which Is said to ex
cel anything of the kind ever shown in
this city.
A most Interesting feature will be the
building of a military bridge by Company
M, under command of Captain J. A. Rid
dell. The bridge is supposed to span a
river, the position of which will be indi
cated, and is to be built from both banks
at the same time. The company Is enthu
siastic in its drilling and the members
expect to equal the record time for this
work. -During the building of the bridge
a skirmish attack , and charge will be
made by Company \D, commanded by
Captain Frank McCarthy. ; The - brjdge
will be defended by Company H, Captain
Thomas Eccles, and a thrilling sham bat
tle will result in the repulse of the at
tacking force. The entire regiment will
then march across the bridge, after which
it will be removed by its builders. Major
John P. Duffy is directing this part of the
programme, and is untiring in his efforts
to make it a feature of the evening.
Another interesting, part of the enter
tainment will be the representation of a
"Night in Camp' by a picked squad from
all the companies. The proceedings will
be enlivened by singing, music, joking,
guard running and other Incidents copied
from actual experience of life in the tent
ed field. , \
The regiment will then be reviewed by
a. prominent United States army officer,
and his Grace Archbishop Riordan will
present the trophy to the winning com
pany. ...
The regiment during its maneuvers will
be commanded by Colonel Daniel C.
Deasy. â¢ The following committee f has
charge of the arrangements: Lieutenant
Colonel I. D. ; Dwyer, chairman; Captain
Frank McCarthy, secretary; Walter E.
Dorn, treasurer; Rev. Philip O'Ryan
Colonel Daniel C. Deasy, Major John P
Duffy, Captain Frank Grimley, Lieuten
ant Frank Colligan and James Coffey. '
Consider Site for Encampment.
The board of officers of the League of
the Cross Cadets last night considered
propositions from the citizens of :San Ra
fael, Santa Cruz and Stockton regarding
the annual encampment of the regiment.
Each place presented many Inducements,
and the matter was referred to a commit
tee. The^date for -the encampment has
not yet been decided upon, but it 1 will
probably be held during the month of
June. .
REVIEWS WORK
OF PAST YEAR
. .-. . . : â¢
-~>^r N Friday night thÂ» various- com- |
ft \l panies of the League of the'Cross
Vl It w111 have a competitive .try out
drill in order, to determine which
. * three of them will take part in
the, annual competitive drill of the regi
ment, to be held Friday, April 18, in the
Mechanics' - Pavilion. Prominent United
States army officers will Judge the merits
of the competing companies.
. The board of officers, has presented to
the regiment a splendid new diamond tro
phy, which has been named the "Colonel
Edward J. Power trophy" in honor of the
late colonel of the regiment. The com
petition among the companies for its pos
session is very keen, and every company
Is expected to enter the tryout.
* Several new and interesting features
have been added to the programme this
Â¦year. Company N of Oakland, under
The second Heinrlch. recital will- :] be
given this evening at Sherman ;& Clay
Hall, when an excellent programme' will
be given. Max Heinrich.in his particular
line. Is inimitable. He sings delightfully
with his whole heart and soul, and has
his audience completely under sway from
his first mellow note and holds' them* to
his last. * Miss Heinrich :' has the sweet
contralto â¢ voice that her earlier
promised and sings with. much' taste and
ease. The Heinrichs should by all means
be heard by the lovers of song. ; - .
The Orpheum's good bill is ; attracting
the usual crowds. Mr. and Mrs. Sidney
Drew, in a clever farce, "A Model Young
Man," and Homer Lind and his company,
in the delightful, sketch, -: "Gringoire "
head the interest. Papinta also pleases;
Stuber, the banjoist, 1 does a wonderful
stunt; Frank Lincoln's character sketches
amuse, and the Melani trio are among the
favorites. â¢
The sale of seats' for "Fiddle Dee Dee,"
the new burlesque at Fischer's Theater,
in which the new members of the com
pany, who have just arrived from .the
East, will first make their, appearance,
begins this evening. "Fiddle - Dee ; Dee"
is the first of a series of Weber and Field
burlesques that are to be given, and is
said to be of the funniest.""*" Maude .Am
bes, C. W. Kolb, Max M. DIM and Barney
Bernard are the new burlesquers and are
all Weber and Field favorites.
\ The Central audience 13 enjoying . "The
Sleeping City" this week. Next comes
"In the Land of the Living," a favorite
melodrama by Frank Harvey, with the
usual full measure/of startling situations
and exciting climaxes. - ,
The dainty Japanese playlet, "Madame
Butterfly," that created a sensation on
its first appearance here last year, will be
produced on Monday night next at the
Alcazar, with Juliet Crosby in her origi
nal role of Madame Butterfly and almost
the same cast as on its first giving. "The
Great Unknown" will take up the re
mainder of the evening. "Brother John"
goes well this week. .
The excellent productions that are
being given at the Grand Opera-house
are attracting the large houses they de
serve, and this week's bill, "The Empress
Theodora," is no exception. Melbourne
MacDowell is very well suited in his role
of Andreas, that he plays with force and
intelligence, and is cleverly supported by
Miss Florence Stone in the " name role.
Herschel Mayall also does good work as
Marcellus, and Gardner Crane and Mar
garet Terry lend strength to the cast.
The staging is very handsome, and the
lions, Nero and Juno, add considerably
to the picturesqueness of the production..
"Gismonda" is announced for next week
i - Â¦ â¢ . Â» â¢ .
"The Serenade" will be heard for the
lajt time on Sunday evening next; when
it iwill end a triumphant run ci Â¦ five
weeks, having been one of the distinct
successes that the Tivoli has put on. An
other Alice Nlelson triumph, "The For
tune Teller,',' will follow.
On Sunday night comes that hilarious
combination of colored loveliness, "Wil
liams and Walker,- probably the funniest
colored team on the boards. Mr. Williams
is the author of "Goo-goo Eyes," "You
Ain't So Warm" and many other ragtime
classics, and with his partner, Walker,
and a big company will probably break
records at the California. Their enter
tainment is called "The Sons of Ham "
and is full of catchy music and songs.
It Is Elks' night v at the California
Theater this evening. The local lodge
will pay tribute to Al G. ' Field, grand
esteemed leading Knight of the Order of
Elks. The minstrels are furnishing good
fun this week. .
"The Christian" is in its last days at
the Columbia Theater, its flrtal perform
ance to be given on Sunday evening next.
On Monday evening comes E. S. Willard,
the famous English actor, who makes
his reappearance here, after several
years, in a new play by Louis N. Parker,
entitled "The Cardinal." Mr. Willard's
visit will be for three' weeks, during
which time he will present "The Profes
sor's Love Story," "Tom Pinch" ..s and
"David Garrick." ./The actor will be well
supported, his leading lady being the tal
ented Ellen O'Malley. Seats range down
from J2 for this engagement.

HERE ONCE MORE
Residents, Through Mayor Schmitz,
Prevail on. Board of Education
to Take Action.
A delegation of sixty residents of the
Sunnyside -district waited on Mayor
Schmitz yesterday for the purpose of so
liciting his aid in inducing the Board' of
Education to purchase a school site on
Flood avenue, between Edna and Forest
streets. The delegation, through its
spokesman, Gustav Schnee, represented
that the lot was the most centrally locat
ed of several that had been offered for
the purpose. It could be purchased for
$5200. while another lot in a less favored
locality would cost much more.
The members of the Board of Education
were present, and after hearing the dele
gation en the subject agreed to select the
site recommended, on which a school
house will be built if an appropriation
therefor can be secured in the next
budget. The purchase of the lot was left
to Director Woodward. "Woodward him
self favored a lot in the Fairmount dis
trict.
Yotmg Greorge Sclmoor's Demise Will
Be Investigated by Coroner
Leland.
Coroner Leland will hold an Inquest
over the body of young George Schnoor,
who died at the City and County Hospi
tal yesterday. Deceased was a teamster
by occupation. During the recent strike
he was doing "picket" duty at the corner
of Folsoin and Fourth streets and "was
struck on the head by an unknown po
liceman. The blow had a fatal effect-
Schnoor suffered loss of memory and vio
lent headaches. Up to three weeks ago
lie was nursed by his parents at 914 Har
rison street. He then became Violent and
was sent to "the City and County Hospi
tal for observation. Schnoor's * condition
gradually grew worse until death ended
his sufferings.
Chief Wiitman has taken the matter In
Jiand. but it is doubtful whether he will
be able to find the officer who wielded the
club, as many heads were tapped during
the strike.

At a special meeting of the California
coursing committee last night at Pythian
Castle an added incentive was offered the
owners of greyhounds to enter their dogs
in the forthcoming show of the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club. Â»
It was decided to offer two stakes, to
be decided at Union Coursing Park, open
only to greyhounds exhibited at the bench
show. This will afford an opportunity of
seeing the dogs in the ring and on the
coursing fleld_ No entrance fee will be
exacted.. The owners of greyhounds were
urged to make liberal entries by President
J. H. Rosseter of the Interstate Coursing
Club. L. A. Klein, manager of the bench
show also addressed the meeting. It Is
hoped to secure an entry of one hundred
greyhounds.
The draw for this week's coursing at
Union Park was held last night. There
are three stakes up for decision on Satur
day and Sunday. The draw resulted as
follows:
The marriage of Loretta Newhall to
Fred S. Newhall was annulled by JudgQ
Hebbard yesterday. Mrs. Newhall, I who
was a Miss Loretta Hall, said 'that when
she married Newhall In thi3 city In 1899
she was but 15 years of age and consented
to become his wife without first having:
secured the consent of her parents.
Anne T. Herve was divorced from "W. A,
Herve yesterday on the ground of extreme
cruelty.
"W. B. Handy3ide, who was married to
Alice Eva Handyside at Sevenoaks, Kent,
England, In 1SS7, brought suit for divorca
yesterday on the ground of desertion. He
alleges that his wife left him at London.
England, In 1S32.
Mary L. Angel", is suing George Angelo
for divorce for i*!lure to provide. They
were married at Antioch in 1893 and have
four children. Mrs. Angelo. alleges- that
in July, 1300, her husband deserted her
and that since that time she has had to
depend upon her own exertions for the
support of herself and children.
Suits for divorce were also filed yester
day by John J. Reilly against Marie Reil
ly for desertion: Louise Palmer against
Arthur B. Palmer for inndeiity and Ida
Bruskey against John Bruskey for failure
to provide. Jette G. Johnson Is suing for
the annulment of her marriage to Martin
J. Johnson, a saloon-keeper at 113 Jack
son street. She alleges that her husband
is also her uncle and that he has beaten
her severely. They were married in 1SD0
and have one child.
Wife Left Him in London.
Rodgers, according to his wife's com
plaint, was not very choice In his selec
tion of expletives. He called her, she al
leges, "a fool," "a miser," "a she devil"
and v a tight." He also told her on nu
merous occasions, she alleges, that she
"was an old good-for-nothing."
Mary Sullivan is suing Jeremiah Sulli
van, to whom she was married in May.
1900, at i Alameda, for divorce on the
ground of cruelty. Mrs. Sullivan charges
her husband with telling her "to pack her
trunks and go" and with saying to her,
"You will go out of this house a dead
woman if you don't do as I say." Mrs.
Sullivan further charges her husband
with refusing to chop wood for her when
she was 111.
Mrs. Rodgers further alleges that on
that occasion Rodgers attacKed the- ser
vant girl for interfering in her behalf,
struck her and threw her to the floor. On
another occasion, she alleges, that while
they were dining at their home he humili
ated her by calling her names in the
presence of a guest and by throwing meat
and other victuals around the room.
i Mrs. Sarah A. Rodgers, relict of
"Ducksy" Rosenbaum, yesterday com
menced her threatened action for divorce
against Harry A. Rodgers, an advertising
agent. The marriage was celebrated last
November and was a great surprise to the
friends of the contracting parties, for the
couple had met but a few days before the
wedding. Rumors have been rife concern
ing family difficulties since the first of
this year and the suit for divorce has
been expected for many days.
Mrs. Rodgers' compalnt is a recital of
alleged conversations In which Rodgers
evidently got the better of the talk, for
she alleges that his language caused her
great mental anguish. Mrs. Rodgers al
leges that while at the St. Nicholas Hotel
her husband, in the presence of her sister,
Mrs. Teresa Parks, humiliated her by
yelling at the top of his voice. This hap
pened on the night of January 2, and on
the night of January 12. ailege3 Mrs.
Kcdgers, he repeated his offense at their
home at 2lo7 Vallejo street.

Against Fit zsimmons on

The crack boxers of the lightweight di
vision are buzzing about Jimmie Britt
like bees on a honeysuckle vine. Young
Corbett, Frank Erne,, Kid Lavigne, Kid
Parker, Willie Fitzgerald and apparently
every boxer with any pretensions to
"class" seems after the Californian.
With all this talent available it is im
possible to get down to the vital point of
signing the bonds that bind. Kid Parker
seems willing to agree to any condition to
get on a match. Billy Lavigne of the
Acme Club, Oakland, has promised to pro
vide a date on which to hold it.
Manager Morris Levy of the Hayes Val
ley Club would bring Britt and Kid La
vlgne together.
The Californian is after the big men of
the East and it seems difficult to get them
At Woodward's Pavilion to-night the
Ariel Rowing Club will present its first
amateur boxing exhibition at popular
prices. The card is an inviting one, there
being two excellent matches and five
promising ones. W. J. Leonard, the
Olympic Club's crack, will meet Paul
Martin in a special match. Ted Wolfe
and Charles Peterson are both clever box
ers and should provide an exciting bout.
The other bouts are between Mike Ma
tier and Barney Driscoll; Lew Powell and
J. McDonald; J. Curley and Fred Land
ers; Al Young and J. Richards; Joe An
geli and Joe Carter.
NEW YORK, April 2.â Differences of
opinion regarding the battle ground may
result in the proposed heavy-weight
championship battle between Jeffries and
Fitssimmons being declared off. Jeffries
insists upon the bout being decided in Los
Angeles, while Fltisimmons favors
Charleston, S. C.
Fitzsimmons asserts bis belief that the
champion has some ulterior motive in
holding out for his (Jeffries'), home city.
He argues that Charleston is neutral
ground and should be given the prefer
ence.
The new offer of tne Charleston club Is
& liberal one. It allows each of the prin
cipals $1000 for training expenses and
gives a purse of $31,000.
The Charleston club's original offer was
75 per cent ot the gross receipts, with a
guarantee of $26,000. Since then the Los
Angeles club has offered a purse of $30,
000. The Charleston club has gone the
Californians $1000 better.
J. C. Jaudon, Eastern representative of
the Southern organization, says his club's
offer will remain open until Saturday. If
by that time Jeffries fails to come to time,
the club will endeavor to match "Kid"
McCoy against the former heavy-weight
champion. McCoy, who has Just returned
from Europe, says he will gladly take Jef
fries' place. McCoy weighs 190 pounds,
twelve pounds more than he ever did be
fore. He will begin taking light exercise
â¢at Muldoon's farm next week.

per issued to-day gives correspondence
respecting the. comparative merits .of
the American, -British and Belgian Ioco
' motives now in ' use In Egypt. In a dis
patch to the] foreign Secretary, Lord
Lansdowne, December 3, covering a num
ber of reports > received from railroad 'offi
cials, the British Diplomatic Agent | and
.Consul' General in 'Egypt, Lord Cromer,
draws the general -conclusion that- the
main reason why so many orders for rail
way plants have been recently given to
the Imited; States is that the American
'firms are able ito execute them with ex
#aprdinary. rapidity, due largely to the
system ; of standardization,
'win respect to; price, Lord Cromer finds
the ; British firms can hold their own
where "special designs have to be execut
ed. With respect to the quality of Brit
ish work, It is; at least equal and often
superior to American and Belgian work,
while in consumption of coal the British
engines have a decided superiority over
the /American, though not over the Bel

dence of Mrs. Hearst's opposition was
found in every city that she visited on the
coast. When asked what motive could
prompt Mrs. Hearst to take this attitude
toward her Mme. Davenport explained
that when she was in San Francisco some
time ago she took occasion to severely
criticize Mrs. Kincaid, the well-known in
structor, and a warm friend of Mrs.
Hearst. The latter did not take kindly
to these strictures and requested Mrs.
Davenport to desist. This she refused to
do, taking every possible occasion to
"haul Mrs. Kincaid over the coals" In
her public lectures and in the homes to
which she had been invited. Mrs. Hearst's
influence was felt at once, says Mrs. Dav
enport, for she left San Francisco with
out making a dollar.
Mrs. Davenport declares that friends of
Mrs. Hearst prevailed upon Rev. Mr.
Forbes to do his utmost against her while
in this city, making representations to
him which were not true. In view of this
she does not feel as bitterly toward Mr.
Forbes as she otherwise would, for shÂ«
feels that he has been imposed upon.
However, she is outspoken In the opinion
that Mr. Forbes would have been much
better off had he attended strictly to his
own important affairs.

nature i3 told by Mrs. Davenport in ex

It was the purpose of Mrs. Phebe Hearst

she could produce documentary evidence
to prove it. She claimed that Mrs. Hearst
recently signified her willingness to ex
pend several thousands of dollars In order
to make good her threat and that evi-
SANTA BARBARA, April 2.â It now
remains for the District Attorney to say
whether Mrs. Davenport shall be brought
to trial next Tuesday on the charge of

ago. Mrs. Dunshee has expressed the
wish that the case be dropped. She does
not wish to prosecute Mrs. Davenport.
The flag of truce was set to the breeia
this morning when Mrs. Dunshee called
upon Mrs. Davenport at her lodgings on
upper Anacapa street. Concerning the.
interview which took place at that' time
the latter said that Mrs. Dunshee ex
pressed the deepest regret that the diffi
culty had ever arisen; that while she At
first felt that she had paid more for tne
instruction in physical culture than she
could afford, sne would never have al
lowed the affair to get into court had she
not been urged to do so by Rev. F. S.
Forbes. She said that she had called
upon District Attorney Squier and re
quested him to dismiss the action, and
finally she had asked Mrs. Davenport's
forgiveness, which was freely and
promptly given.
Mrs. Dunshee was seen at her residence
on Bath street this afternoon. She ad

case and that the decision now rested en

ST. PAUL, April 2.â Passengers arriv
ing to-day on a Great Northern train due
last Friday tell of being snowbound for
four days and five nights on the prairies
of North Dakota in the worst blizzard the
Northwest has known in many years,
with only food enough for two frugal
meals a day, and with such a small
amount of fuel that the women had to
wrap themselves in blankets and the men
to wear their overcoats day and night to
keep from freezing.
Late Thursuay afternoon the train
picked its precarious way out of .Wil
liston in the hope of being able to reach
Minot, fourteen miles to tne east, before
night. Almost midway, at a little stop
ping place called Ray, where there is'oniy
a siding, a water tank and a coal shed,
the train was stalled. The engineer
thought he could run the engine back to
Williston and get aid, and, taking the
conductor with him, started on the trip.
The lone engine was stuck in a drift in
a cut a short distance out of the town
and had to be abandoned. This left the
train of eight coaches and about 250 pas
sengers alone on the siding and with all
communicatioircut off. Then started the
long siege, during which the cold had to
be borne and hunger stifled.
One of the most magnificent presents
received by the bride was a solid gold
salver sent by J. Pierpont Morgan. The
groom's present to the bride was a hand
some necklace of beaded gold, set at in
tervals with rubies and emeralds and with
a large emerald pendant from the circlet.
This gift and a rope of pearls were the
only jewels worn by the bride.
Following a custom established at the
time of the weeding of Miss Hill's elder
sister, the father allowed the bride to
eeiect any picture she preferred from his
splendid gallery of paintings. The bride,
among other presents, received $230,000 in
bends from her father.
The out-of-town guests included Mrs.
E. M. Beard, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Tay
lor, Will Beard and Mark Roves of New
York, Mr. and Mrs. Eric B. Dahlgren of
New York, F. H. Rawson of Chicago and
Count Matsukata, the Japanese states
man, and his suite.
-t of wedlock. Following the ceremony
-~i elaborate wedding breakfast was
â¢erved.
Miss Rachel Hill wore a simple but very
pretty gown of pink chiffon and carried
flowers, intermingled with a bit of green.
The ceremony by the Archbishop was
very impressive. Before the service he
spoke briefly upon the spiritual signlti-
CÂ£ ce of marriage rites, of its separate
-" s and distinction from the civil con
The bride's gown was of plain white
6atin, very heavy and very rich, but plain
almost to severity. It was fashioned with
the conventional high bodice and long
Bleeves and court train. The only garni
ture was the point lace, which was draped
about the yoke and was appliqued upon
the skirt. The tulle veil completed the
costume. She carried no flowers.
Archbishop Ireland, accompanied, by the
aged Monsignor Oster, who officiated at
the marriage of the bride's parents, and
the Rev. Thomas J. Gibbons, the bride's
pastor, entered first. Following the group
of ecclesiastics were the groom and his
best man, Eric Dahlgren. Then came
Miss Rachel Hill, walking alone, and fol
lowing her the bride with her father.
8T. PAUL, Minn., April 2.â At. noon to
day, in the family residence oh Summit
avenue, occurred the wedding of Miss
Ruth Hill, daughter of President James
J. Hill of the Great Northern Railway
and Northern Securities Company, and
Anson McCook Beard, an attorney of New
York City, t One hundred and thirty
fc-uests were* invited. The bridal proces
sion was extremely simple. As the guests
stood about in conversational attitude
the music of the bridal chorus from "Lo
hengrin" was heard from the music room
tcross the hall. There was no music ex
cept that of the pipe organ, George H.
Fairclough, organist at the Church of St.
John the Evangelist, being the performer.

A TEARFUL BABY
Wanted to Write a Letter.
A man came upon his little girl in - a
grievous and tearful condition because
ehe had been restricted in her allowance
of Grape-Nuts. The father says, "I am
little at home and I hardly understood
vhy the absence of one particular food
should excite her grief, but upon inquiry
ditcovered that she had taken such a de-
cie'ed fancy to It that she was refusing
meat and almost every other kind of
food. . :
"Since she has bc-en using Grape-Nuts
a serious condition of constipation of tli'e
towe!s has been changed to a i .'roughly
normal condition and her fiesh is an
fcolid as a rock.
"I quieted her grief by agreeing to let
her write a letter, or I would write If she
would tell, n-.e what to say, so here It If*:
'My Dear Mr. Grape-Nuts: Mamma will
no:, cive me all the Grape-Nuts I want.
Â£be says I must eat some beef, and I
don't like it; I juft like Grape-Nuts
better than anything else, with cream on
them. Mamma used to soak them In
water, but now I just eat them dry with
cream on them. If I had ten dollars to
buy Grape-Nuts with I would fill the
big pantry fchelf, then mamma would
give me more. I am six years eld.
With love, and thanking you for making
Grape-Nuts. D. L. F.' "
Her father adds: "Right here I may
gratefully give credit to Grape-Nuts
(which has Jargely taken the place, of
rich, indigestible food in my own, case)

THE United States army transport
Crook arrived yesterday after a
fast passage from Manila with
part of the Seventeenth Infantry
on board. She brought thirty-two
cabin passengers and had in the steerage
642 men. The majority of the latter be
long to the Seventeenth. The remainder
are casuals, discharged men and Invalids.
The Crook left Manila March 6. arrived
.at Nagasaki March 11 and sailed from th-;
Japanese port for San Francisco March
14. She took quite a southerly course
home and encountered summer weather
throughout the voyage.
This is the first visit of the Crook to
this port. She is a large vessel and has
on board the happiest and - most con
tented company that ever manned a
troopship. Her commander. Captain
Morgan Walcott, is a young man, but only
Captain Lafflin of the Burnside and Cap
tain Willson of the Meade have beeu
longer than he In the transport service.
Walcott has a reputation for courtesy,
that has made the Crook a favorite ship
both with passengers and subordinate
officers.
The Crook was built In 1S83 by âDenny
of Dumbarton, and at her launching was
christened Primrose Hill. She was the

beginning of last month, when she start
ed for this port.
Her average speed from Nagasaki was
about twelve knots. Captain Walcott
pays a high tribute to Chief Engineer
Williams." The Crook has compound.en
gines of an old-fashioned type. Under the
careful nursing of Williams they have
been stopped just once, and then for
but five minutes, in a voyage of 20.0D0
miles.
"I always want to say something nice
about Williams." said Captain Walcott,
"he's a marvel."
The cabin passengers who came home
on the Crook were:
The Crook carried her share of fighting
men to Cuba and brought from there the
bodies of the American soldiers killed
during the war. She also brought to
America the Cuban schoolteachers who
spent three months at Harvard Univer

first of the twin type and did not
suit the parties for whom she was built.
A syndicate styling Itself the Primrose
Hill Company ran her for awhile between
Glasgow and the Cape. Then the Allan
line bought her, rechristened her Rouma
nian and put her on the run between Liv
erpool and New York. She was engaged
in this trade when Uncle Sam purchased
her, fitted her with new boilers and trans
formed her into a trooper. She has been
in active service ever since.

Developments on the Comstock lode are
expected to receive a new impetus as soon
as the new pumping apparatus is in
stalled. The lode, which has led the world
in its adaptation of new processes in min
ing, will be the first in which pumping
,by electricity at such a depth. or on so
huge . a scale has been 'attempted.' The
order for the >. new machinery was | given
some weeks ago. The apparatus will be
delivered "at" the mine about the middle of
June, and by August the big pumps will
be at work. ,
To empty the main shaft to the 2150-foot
level a pipe of that length, discharging by
a jet into a pipe 500 reet long with one
outlet - into the Sutro tunnel, has been
successfully used. The normal flow of
water in the mine, 3000 gallons a minute,
has been easily controlled. It is now the
purpose to extend the pipe from the sur
face down to the 2500-foot level, and to
Install at the 2150-foot level three .duplex
double-acting Reidler pumps, each with a
capacity of 1500 gallons a minute, and all
three discharging through a fourteen-inch
pipe 4500 gallons each minute into the
Sutro tunnel. The twelve-inch jet pipe
will gradually be extended until the base,
of the shaft is reached. The water at

ON RENTAL
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are especially valu-
able for catarrhal colds in children because they
are pleasant to the taste and may bÂ« used
freely to break up severe colds and croup at
the very beginning.
Dr. Wair-wrlgkt says: "I never hetitate to
prescribe Stuaifs Catarrh Tablets for catarrhal
headaches and catarrhal deafness because I
know them to be perfectly rafe for cbild or
adult and have s*en many remarkable) curts
resulting from their regular daily use; because
they are advertised aqd sold' in drug stores- it
no reason why any eood phyrician should "not
use them because we should wize uj on the
means of cure wherever found."
Dr. Eamsdell. in commenting on catarrh
cures, says: "I can heartily recommend
Smart's Catarrh Tabiets. because they contain
no cocaine nor other dangerous drug found in
eo many advertised catarrh cures. 1 have
known of many cases of Ions standing catarrh
of the head ar.d throat completely cured
by the daily use of there tablets for several
weeks. One case in particular, which I could
not reach with an inhaJsr or spray and where
the catarrh caubed daily headaches and a
noticeable loss of hearing, was entirely cured
by this harmless but effective remedy."
Stuart's Catarrh Tabiets is the best remedy
to remove catarrha! secretion, whether In the
ncse. throat or stomach, because they are com-
â¢ posed of wholesome antiseptics. Blood Root,
Red Gum from Eucalyptus tree, etc. When you
ut-e thete tablets you kffbw what you are put-
tir.g Into your system and are not taking chances
with cocaine, opiates cr similar poisons found
In so many catarrh cures and cough medic! ik-m.
Nearly all cheap cough mixtures and throat
lozenges contain opiates; these cheap medlcinefc
give a temporary relief, especially with little
children, by destroying: nerve sensation; the
irritation in throat, which causes coughing, is
temporarily removed, not by removing the
cause, but by deadening the nerves of feeling
the irritation !b not felt although It is still
there and will promptly return.
Catarrh Tablets, which they sell at 50 cents for
full sized treatment, is thÂ« safest, most ef-
fective and popular of all catarrh remedies.
A Simpl3 Internal Remedy
Makes Remarkable Cures
of Catarrh.
People who have used sprays. Inhalers, salves
end Tvashes for catarrh and have found how
useless and inconvenient they are, will be
agreeably surprised at results following the
use of a pleasant, internal rsmedy in tablet
form; druggists everywhere adroit that Stuart'*
Surprising Results
PAINE'S CEIiERY COMPOUND.
The Dregs and After- Results
i of Terrible Gripps
Lead to Consnmptlon and
Other Fatal Troubles.
Paine's Celery
Compound
Saves a Former Member of the
Indiana Legislature.
This is the Season to Use
the Great Medicine if You -
Would Banish the Seeds
of Disease Prom the
System.
On every hand we see men and women
who at .this season should be active, hale
and strong:, losing: flesh and weight, look-
Ing pale and languid. We hear them
complain of weakness, pain in the chest,
I backache and sideache. Their friends
note with alarm the pale cheeks and
sunken eyes; the color of the skin gives
evidence of blood impurities.
Ah! reader, these are all indications
that the deadly dregs of grippe have per-
meated the whole system, distributing
poisons and impurities In blood and tis-
sues. ' Â¦ . /
Act at once with wisdom and decision;
you cannot afford - to lose precious time
experimenting with medicines that have
no reputation, that have no positive vic-
tories to their credit. .
Heaven help you to use the life saver
that rescued and saved Mr. Stephenson.
While in a perilous condition of health
providence truly directed Mr. Stephen-
son to make use of Paine's Celery Com-
pound. The first bottle produced a -mar-
velous and happy effect; his life blood
was being freshened and enriched; his ap-
petite was improved; strength was taking
the place of weakness, and the. ruddy
tinge of health was apparent in the once
pale face. Mr. D. T. Stephenson of Pilot
Knob, Ind., writes as follows:
"Some years ago while serving as a
member of the Indiana Legislature I con-
tracted a severe case of grippe, and was
run down and completely out of sorts and
found but little relief from any remedy
until I tried Paine's- Celery . Compound.
The first Â¦ bottle did me wonderful and
marked good, and its continued use,for a
short time restored me to my usual vigor
and freshness. Tour Paine's Celery Com-
pound has been used by my family since
then for general prostration of the sys-
tem with the most gratifying results.
Paine's Celery Compound Is a great quiet-
er and restorer of the nerves to their
normal condition: indeed, its action on
the " nerves and nerve centers has been
most gratifying In my case."

"It seemed that nothing short
of a miracle could save my little
daughter from an untimely:
death," says City : Marshall A.
H. Malcolm, of Cherokcc.Kan.
" When two years' old she was
taken with stomach and bowel
trouble and despite the efforts
of the best physicians we could
procure, she grew gradually
worse and was pronounced in â¢
curable. A friend advised
iutek* Nervine
â¢ and after giving it a few days
she began to improve and final-
ly fully recovered. .She is now"
past five ; years of age and the
very /picture of health."

The Situation in Wall Street.
CONDITION OF THE MOXET AND SHARE
MARKETS. WITH FUTURE PROSPECTS.
The New York circular Â©f Henry Clews says:
"Easter holidays have restricted operations
on the etock exchange and deprived the mar
ket of any support that might come from ad
ditional activity. Increased - firmness of the
money market and a further contraction of
loans were also unfavorable to stock specula
tion, although the market continues to show
an undertone of strength resulting 1 from strong
support. The banks have been losing funds
through both the interior and Sub-Treasury
movements, much of the first named drain be
ing due to the usual preparations for April
tettlcniente. The latter demands, however,
will soon be over and by the middle of April
currency should be again moving in this direc
tion. â¢ The money market is in a comfortable
enough condition, so long as no undue pres
sure appears; but in the present low condition
of the bank reserves any urgency in demand
Â¦would materially stiffen lending rates In this
market. Until the reserves have been replen
ished, cither through a contraction of loans
or through an Increase in the reserve items,
the money market is likely to remain in a
sensitive condition; and it may be Borne weeks
before any expansion in the loan account, such
aa would be necessary In a rising market, will
be permissible. No help seems likely from
national bank circulation, which is showing a
steady diminution; the high price for Govern
ment bonds, induced by Treasury purchases,
tempting: their sale and the calling In of cir
culation.
"'The railroad situation continues satisfac
tory, earnings Ehowing no signs of diminution
and the outlook being for good traffic for some
time to come. With average crops this year
the railroads ought to continue to do well.
The market, however, v.ill be chiefly influenced
by ihe delay or progress In the merger plans
of th* big leaders, the outcome of which is a
mystery. The big leaders, of course, believe
In their ultimate success. What they will do
if the Northern Securities Company Is declared
illegal remains to be seen. While this import
ant uncertainty hangs over the market a pro
longed vigorous bull movement is out of the
question. Good railroad shares are, however,
sj firmly held that frequent upward spurts of
a manipulative character may be readily ex
pected. The industrial shares are in a position of
ir.uch less strength than the railroads. The com
munliy-of-intere*t idea, which in the industrial
world took the form of trusts, is much less
â¢successful than in railroads. New competition
bteaÂ«3i!y prows, and as profits are cut down
by lower prices or decreased sales the burdens
of nveix-aiiitalization â the price paid for sur
render <jf individualism â are distinctly felt. A
number of unsatisfactory annual reports on
the t-rfcat industrials have been filed during
the last six months, and more are likely to
follow. Not a few of the industrials are sell
ing at considerably lower prices than existed
a year ago. The principal exceptions are the
*teÂ«>J fecurjUes. -which have been sustained bx
the extraordinary activity ia the Iron and steel
trades Â¦Those from the new uses for steel and
the ;Â»â¢Â¦Â£* amount of new construction going
en and promising . to continue during the re
mainder of. the year. When this demand
afc&tes and trade comes uown to normal pro-
Portions it will be interesting to observe how
ihe*Â» concerns carry their load of inflation
"OutfUJo of the features alluded to the gen
eral situation is satisfactory. Labor troubles
are Jlkely to exert a temporary depression but
hel L f th t Se ,^ are iÂ£?f lt J s quUe Possible 'that
tHe big .holders will endeavor to infuse fresh
life and activity Into the market as soon as
monetary conditions permit. This mav affoid
better trading opportunities than for "several
months; Etill. as we have said before, caution
and discrimination will be necessary on the
long Eide. â¢â¢-. -

ALEXANDER G. McADIE,
Â¦ tX.'-- Forecast Official.
self an illuminating commentary on the char
acter of the market. United States Leather led
the list, followed at a considerable interval by
Amalgamated Copper. The dealings In Colo
rado Fuel fell to insignificant proportions In
comparison with the recent trading. . Sugar
was well up In the ll^t of active stocks. Of
the prominent railroads only St. Paul and
Louisville and Nashville showed a notable de
gree of activity and the fluctuations did riot
reach as much as a point in either of " them.
The extreme range in the United States Steel
stocks was % for the common and % for the
preferred, and both closed at a shade under
last night, in spite of the extraordinary earn
ings reported tor the year or the company's
business and the official assurance given of
the success of the plan lor providing $j0,ouu,000
additional capital. Many of the usually promi
nent stocks did not open at all before the
middle of the day's session and not a few \vill
be found with no sales recorded. The price
movements or any consequence are almost in
variably among the less known stocks and the
reasons advanced were very % obscure. St. Paul
and Omaha rose 6 points on a few. transactions
and the preferred 6, but Pere Marquette
dropped 6 on only one sale. The Hocking Val
ley stocks were active and strong, the common
rising 4 and the preferred 2. Rumors were
revived of a plan to retire the preferred stock
at par. The Wisconsin Central stocks and the
Toledo, St. Louis and Western stocks were
bought, apparently on the strength of their .
strategic position in the competitive field. The
New xork Dock stocks rose In an erratic man
ner on the supposed sudden realization of the :
valuable equities In. the property. The move
ment In the Leather stocks was on the assump
ttoD that the preferred stock and Its claims to
differential dividends to be closed up In some
way by a bond issue. The losses, which were
liberally sprinkled through the list of stocks
of a similar character," had no other foundation
than they had previously advanced on rumors
which have not been confirmed. The weakness
of Rock Island was associated with the an
nouncement of its additional stock issue. The
decline in the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburg I
stocks was doubtless due to the coal miner*'
strike in its territory. The movement in the
general list was insignificant. It is true that
prices were at one time advanced a fraction,
but no other cause was apparent than that they ,
declined yesterday; The crop report by the
Government weather bureau had some influ
ence upon sentiment, but the present grain
markets are regarded as under the artificial
influence of large speculative operations and
are, therefore, distrusted as an Index of actual
conditions. The statistics of the copper trade
and rumors of an approaching agreement as
to the output and prices -were I given some cre
dence. Future money market shipments are
still awaited, the easing tendency of money
here being counterbalanced by the expectations
of early gold exports. The market closed dull
and heavy on the taking of profits by, room
tradere. â¢ " ; " - -j

PERSONAL.
There was a legal tournament yester
day in the United States Circuit Court, in
which Judge Morrow broke the record for
the volume of business done in a single
day's session. There ,were three jury
trials, resulting in three verdicts for the
Government; a fourth suit in which judg
ment'- was entered by j compromise, judg
ments rendered by default in the fifth
arid sixth and the seventh/ a patent'ease,
that of Holmes vs.. the Harbor Commis
sioners, placed on trial before a jury and
still in progress. â¢
In the two cases of the Atlantic, Gulf
and Pacific. Company vs. the Central Irri
gation District of Colusa and Glenn coun
ties, judgment by default was entered for
the lull amounts sued for, respectively
$75,770 and $38,202. The suit was brought
December 31, 1900, to recover the value of
certain irrigation bonds and coupons pur
chased from the defendant by the plain
tiff. v
Â¦ By agreement of the attorneys on both
sides of the case of Thomas A. Keogh vs.
the Southern Pacific Company, a judg
ment for $2500 was entered in favor, of the
plaintiff. Suit had been brought to re
cover damages for personal injuries sus
tained in a railroad accident. .
Â¦Three civil actions,. brought on behalf of
the United States Government to recover
the value of timber cut and removed from
Government land in Siskiyou County,
were tried by jury, the Government win
ning .in each case. - Assistant United
States District Attorney E. J. Banning
fought the cases for the Government and
was successful in each instance. The first
was . that of the â¢ United States against
Joseph B/. Le Due to recover $5688, the
alleged value of timber taken: off Town
ships 46 and 47 north, range 9 west, and
worked up into lumber in the Le Due saw
mills between the years 1873 and 1898, the
market price at the mill during that per
iod being $20 per thousand feet. The jury
split the difference and returned a verdict
in favor of the Government for $2500. The
next case was that of the United States
against George W: Magoffey, who bought
the Lie Due mill afterward and followed
in the sawdust tracks of his predecessor.
Judgment .was rendered in favor of the
Government for $4230. The next was that
of; the United States against Eugene F.
Maltby, .a partner of Magoffey." "X.* ver
dict', was . rendered against Maltby. for
$1098. ., .

JUDGE MORROW
BREAKS RECORD
. W. H. Â¦ Mills suggested that trees such
as are in Golden Gate Park should be
planted on the grounds of the St. Louis
Exposition. He believed that permission
could be obtained from the St. Louis
management, and as it is probable that
the exposition will be postponed there
will be time for the trees to grow. The
plantation, he said, would indicate the
semi-tropical climate of this section and
prove an excellent advertisement.
The matter of installing an exhibic at
Ogden was referred to the committee on
exhibits, with power to act.

The committee that will be recommend
ed to get together the money for the im
migration work is as follows:
Two decisions ' of importance were
reached by the executive committee of
th> Promotion Committee, which has un
dertaken to bring desirable immigrants
into the counties north of Tehachapi. The
first was to recommend to the Promo
tion Committee, which will meet this aft
ernoon, that a large committee, represen
tative of the material interests of San
Francisco, be appointed to solicit sub
scriptions for the work. It was also de
termined that the size of the fund to be
raised shall be $2000 per month for a pe
riod of one year. A resolution was adopt
ed that the money so raised shall be re
garded as a special fund to be expended
under the direction of the Promotion
Committee. President Sbarboro appoint
ed the subcommittees of the Promotion
Committee.
Mrs. Bell also has something to say
about the payment of $5000 to her attor
ney, and the payment of rent for the of
fiC3 now used by the estate. The various
items regarding which an explanation is
demanded are explicitly set forth, the
reasons for the particular action in each
case being given.
Attorney Leicester filed a contest
against some -very small item3 incurred
by Mrs. Bell In the attempted sale of cer
tain portions of the estate. These Items
ranged from $2 50 up to $23.
The various legal propositions involved
will be threshed out on Tuesday next at
11 o'clock, when a preliminary move will
be made to discontinue the family allow
ance of $100 per month now granted Mrs.
Bell. This will be followed by the main
contest over the settlement of her ac
count as special administratrix.
. In her account and answer filed yester
day Mrs. Bell alleges that the opposing
attorneys. Drown, Leicester & Drown,
have gone out into the highways and by
ways and solicited the prosecution of
claims against the estate upon a com
mission basis. She alleges that contracts
have been made agreeing to accept from
15 per cent to 50 per cent of the amount
recovered for claimants against the es
tate.
Among the claims mentioned as. being:
In this category are those of wakelee &
Co.; $220 50; Davis, Schonwasser & Co.,
$2000; Parrott & Co., $345; Goldberg,
Bo wen & Co., $553; Kast & Co., $724;
Laurel Hill Cemetery Association, $1000;
Daniel Sheerin, $12,000.
Mrs. Teresa Bell filed her answer in
Judge Coffey's court yesterday to the
contest of her final account in the estate
of Thomas Bell, deceased. She was rep
resented by Attorney T. Z. Blakeman,
while J. M. Leicester of Drown, Leicester
& Drown represented -the opposition.
There was an. exchange of a lot of docu
ments, reiterating many of the issues
heretofore raised, but presented in new
iorm.

TH E ANCIENT ORDER OF WORKMEN
Business of ?tne^S||^d:^D|i^sf Session of
the Grand Lpdge-- 1 Flrop6sitioh^tO: Create
/ Office, of "'Commissioner of Extension Work-
Attorney Reuben H. Lloyd represented
the business men who made the offer of
$300,000. and Attorney W. H. Chapman
represented the San Francisco Construc
tion Company. Lloyd opened the proceed
ings by renewing his offer of $300,000.
Chapman raised him $300. which was fol
lowed by a bid from Lloyd of $332,500. the
appraised value of the land. Chapman
then offered $335,000 for the tract, which
figure was raised to $336,000 by Lloyd.
Chapman then bid $340,000, to which
a mount Lloyd added $1000, "Just to get a
rm'le from the court." he said.
The smile was forthc r.ing, and so was
a raise of $1000 from Chapman,- followed
by another from Lloyd. The bidding at
this time was exciting, the bidders in
creasing their offers $1000 at a time. L'oyd
Several weeks ago the property was of
fered for sale by the executors of the Su
tro estate. Louis LJpmann, Sig Stern and
Isaac Liebes. representing several busi
ness men, bid $300,000 for the land, and
their offer was accepted, by the executors.
When the question of confirming the sale
came up in court Attorney McEnerney
objected, claiming that if the sale was
postponed for a few days a much higher
price could be obtained. A week's delay
was granted, and when the matter came
up yesterday the courtroom was crowded
with persons anxious to get the land, and
the bidding which followed showed that
the attorney's contention that the land
was worth more than $300,000 was true.
Attorney Garret TV. McEnerney'e objec
tion to the sale of twelve blocks of land
near the Affiliated Colleges belonging to
the Sutro estate for $300,000 has resulted In
a gain of $61,000 to the Sutro heirs. The
property was old for 5361,000 yesterday in
I>epartment 9 of the Superior Court to the
San Francisco Construction Company,

Mooser assigns as his reason for giving
up the position the fact that his private
business was suffering because "of the in
roads which the duties of public office
made on his time. Back of his re=,. o 'na
tlon, however, lies another story that
Mooser did not like the unfavorable crit
icism to which he has been subjected re
cently.
When the last budget was adopted pro
vision was made to pay Mooser $250 per
month as City Architect," with the under
standing that he was to devote his entire
time to the duties) of that office. This
Mooser agreed ,to do, but he did not keep
his promise. His dereliction In this re
gard was made the subject. of an inves
tigation by Mayor Schmitz, and it Is said
that Mooser took the alternative of relin
quishing his position voluntarily rather
.than explain why his office hours were
from 9 to 11 a. m., notwithstanding that
the charter requires a public official to
be ' in constant attendance between S:30
a. m. and 5 p. m. Again, it has been al
leged against Mooser that he was using
his public position to advance his private
Interests, .but no proof was ever devel
oped-on that point.
â¢ The Board of Public Works will accept
Mooser's resignation and will appoint an
architect in his place who will be required
\o ..comply with the provisions of tha
"charter. Mooser is Interesting himself In
the candidacy of Matthew O'Brien, who
may. get the place. O'Brien has done
much work for the city which it is
claimed should have been done by
Mooser, but O'Brien drew the money for
the work. T. J. Welch is another candi
date for the place.
City Architect William Mooser will pre
sent his resignation to the Board of Pub
lic Works this morning. Mooser has held
the position during the past fiscal year
at a salary of $250 per month Previous
to las't July he received a salary of $100
per- month, but was not supposed during
that period to devote his entire time to
the duties of the office.

advised her to run after her. > She did so
and saw the woman throw a purse into

nized it as hers,' but' it was empty. She
continued her pursuit of the woman, who
crossed the street and ran down to Grant
avenue. She turned Into the Baltimore
House, but was caught , by . two soldiers
and held till Miss Byrne appeared.. Miss
Byrne accused the woman of stealing her

-For several weeks worshipers at the
French- Catholic church Notre Dame des
yietoires, on Bush street, between Grant
-avenue and Stockton, have had their
purses and other articles stolen and one
of the priests missed his gold watch. It
was suspected that the thief was. a
woman,' but she committed the thefts. so
deftly that no clew could -be found as to
her identity until yesterday afternoon,
when she was not quick enough and her
arrest- followed.
Miss E.'.H. Byrne, a young lady living
at 1088 Union street, went into the church
and took a seat in one of the pews. She
had two books and her purse and um
brella with her. She placed the books and
purse on top of the pew and her umbrella'
on the seat and knelt In. prayer. She
heard the rustling of a dress and instinct
ively felt that some woman in the pew
behind her had hurriedly takenher de
parture. When she raised her head she
discovered that her purse, which ! con

finally made an offer of $360,000, and gave
every evidence that this amount was as
high as he would go. Chapman evidently
thought so also, for he promptly said:
"I bid $361,000 for the land." ,
Lloyd pondered for a moment and then
consulted with his clients.' After a brief
conversation he turned to Chapman and
said:
"The property Is yours, Mr. < Chapman.
Take it and our best wishes."

less number of votes than Walsh and
Coghlan. Judge Murasky also declared
Fred Bent and Horace Wilson elected
members of the board. Bent and Wilson
were shown to be elected by the official
returns, but as they were among the
number of -Supervisors whose seats were
contested they were compelled to go
through with the recount.
The motion of James M. Wllkins to be
declared elected Supervisor as an inter
venor in the contest was denied by Mu
rasky. Wilkins, who did v not enter into
the contest, claimed his seat on the
ground that as he had more votes accord

than either of the eight contestants he
was entitled to the office.

member was the beneficiary, in this, that
she was his wife at. the time- of the is
suance of the certificate; that no. change
had been made, and that his second wife
was not entitled to the money. To ob
viate this the supreme representatives
were requested to bring about legislation
to prevent the payment of a certificate to
one not a blood relative or one not wholly
dependent on the member. V ..-Â¦ .â¢
Another resolution was that the su

supreme body enact a law authorizing the
Issuance of $500 certificates. . ? -
