Hazel depends upon pins for the hold
ins together of her work. So do many
of the artistic milliners. She evidently
grasps the principle that trimmings must
be as loose as possible In order to be ef
fective.
Pins are convenient for her. too. with
her restless spirit. Uor her creations are
/ ephemeral things that last no longer than
/ the lilies of the field.
; But she is a whole lot happier making

Thin girls should play ball for a term or
two and then they need never fear an
evening, frock or a bathing suit. The
muscles in the legs are used in running,
and the calves become rounded. â¢When
the ball is flung from goal to goal the
arms become plump and well curved. Na
ture responds eagerly to every opportu
nity that is' given her and she acts with
quickness and ability. The jumping and
tumbling stirs up the circulation so that
the blood is sent to every tissue in great
quantities.
Instead of sitting at home and doing all
kinds of fancy work, join a basket ball
team and get down to hard work. Play

better all around. The soft flesh, which
Is more of a hindrance than anything else,
will harden, and when muscle develops,
as it will, you will not only be symmetri

Ball playing cultivates flexibility at the
waist. In the bending and twisting of the
trunk and limbs the vital organs receive
such exercise as will make them strong.

One evening as har mother was tucking

This amusing story was told ot tha lit
tle nleca of Phillip* Brooks, the famous
divine, relates tha Philadelphia Times:
There is a tradition that wherever this
stone shall be a Prince of the Scythian
race shall rule. This was fulfilled when
James VI of Scotland became Jame3 I
of England. With the exception of Queen
Mary all our British sovereigns have been
crowned in it. It waa the subject of a
special treaty at Northampton, when it
was promised that it should be returned
to Scotland. Needless to say, that prom
ise was not kept. This Identical stone is
said to be the-ona which Jacob used for
a pillow. But the Turk3 also claim to
have Jacob's stone at Jerusalem.
The Koh-i-Noor diamond 13 similarly
said to endow it3 possessor with the sov
ereignty of India. It is the private prop
erty of his Majesty; it was presented to
the late Queen by the East India Com
pany. A French traveler mentions seeing
it In 1663, when it was in the possession
of Aurungzebe, Emperor of the Moguls.
Her late Majesty had it set in a brooch.
It has been valued at Â£140,000.
Napoleon caused himself to be crowned
King of Italy with the iron crown of Lom
bardy. The same kind of virtue is as
cribed to this crown as i3 credited to the
Koh-i-Ncor. But whether the virtue had
gone out of it. or, as was alleged, the
crown was not the original one, but a re
production, one thing is certain, Napoleon
did not wear It long. Though It is known
as the Iron Crown of Lombardy the only
piece of iron which it contains Is an al
leged "nail from the true cross." St.
Peter's chair at Rome, the pontifical
throne, so the tradition runs, was pre
sented to the Apostle Peter by a Roman
Senator, one of the earliest converts to '
Christianity.
Cvery one will remember what a dis
turbance there was when the British rest
dent In Ashantl carried off tha golden
stool. The golden stool Is tha throne of
the monarch of Ashantl. Tha regalia also
Includes a golden ax and a golden ho*.
The golden ax is carried before tha Aah
antt Embaasador when affairs at mon
than ordinary Importance ara In hand.
The golden hoe symbolizes tha Indention
of the King to hoa bis way through all
obstacles. Supernatural power* are at
tached to all three of them.
BUT few people at tha coronation
will be near enough to test the
truth of the tradition that the coro
nation chair In "Westminster Abbey.
King Edward's chair, gives out a sound
when a legitimate heir to the throne sits
In it. In the case of a pretender It Is
said to be dumb. The sound comes, It Is
alleged, not from the wooden framework
of the chair, but from the stone of destiny
beneath the seat. It la as well to know
thla. Otherwise one might have said that
there was nothing unusuil In a chair
creaking, especially if it were "seldom sat

'Come out; thar's no good skulkin'.'

folks on the plains is allers hungry.
"While Bill is camped down on a stool

"As they can see his mare. Black Nell

gues jestly that the McCandlas outfit
knows he's thar; an' from the speec
they're makin' in their approach, he like
wise dedooces that they're heap eager fot
his company.
"Bill don't have to study none to tel:
that thar's somebody groin' to get action
It's likely to be mighty onequal, but
thar's no he'p; an' so Bill pulls his gun
belt tighter, an' organizes to go as far as
he can. He has with him only one six
shooter; that's a-, severe oversight. Now
if he was packin' two, the approachin'

"As Bill rolls the cylinder of his pistol
to see that she's wcrkin' free, an' loosens

falls on a eight-spar' Hawkins rifle hang

WHEN to force and when not to
force partner, is a most per
plexing question and must be
left in a great measure to the
good judgment of the player.
Bo much depends upon the character of
your hand, the situation, the score, the
inference drawn from the fall of the cards
that no set rules will meet all cases. The
general rules given are as good as may
be devised, and the student should Â¦, ad
here to them. The advanced player will
follow them in the absence of any infor
mation afforded by the play to warrant
him from breaking them.
Here are some eeneral rules which apply
to forcing your partner:
Firstâ Do not force your partner when
Â¦weak in trumDs.
Secondâ You may force your' partner
when you are strong in trumps.
Thirdâ Force partner though weak in
trumps when he has shown a desire to be
forced.
Fourthâ When a cross-ruff Is evident.
TELL you-all a tale of blood!"
The Old Cattleman's tones rang
with a note of peevishness, "it
s-hore irritates me a heap, son.

camped on the sunrise Â«<f the Alleghenies.
I regyards the East as a mighty onsafe
region an' fo I tells you."
Having thus defended the West from
Eastern aversion and properly estab'
lished its status as a theattir of peace
and lamb's wool gentleness, my talkative
friend appeared relieved. The red flush ,
left his furrowed forehead and he was
composed apain with his usual genial air.
"Nacheraliy, I admits." he "went on,
"thar has been a moOicum of blood shed
west of the Mississippi an' some s;light
share tharof can be charged to Arizona.
No, I can't say I deplores these Tallin's

outlook. If a angel was to appear in our

now, livin" forever like that Wanderin'

Thar's straight; I'd drop dead in my
moccasins.
"It don't make much difference, wheii
you gives yourse'f to a ea'm considera
tion of the question as to when you dies

Is. to die as becomes a gent of sperit who

or late comes to his trail's end. Life is
like a faro game. One sport has ten dol
lars, another a hundred, another a thou
sand, and still others has rolls that would
pack a mule. But whether a gent is
weak or strong, pore or rich, it's writ
ten in advance that he's doomed to go
broke final. He's doomed to die. Thar
fore, when that's settled, of what mo
ment is it whether he goes broke in a
hour, or pikes along for a weekâ dies to
day or postpones his funeral for years
an' xnebby decades? None at all. The
matter of when you die is of Â¦some con
cern as a fear, mebby, but you can put
down a bet it's of no importance as a
fact; and one hundred years from now
if somebody asks you the question you'll
reply as I do now.

he has been able to place that you have
the command, and discards a low card,
such as the 2, 3. or 4, he Invites a force.
In most all of these cases he. has indi
cated to you his willingness to be forced.
But if he should be forced to trump a
winning card it does not imply that he
desires to be forced again.
Â¦ When strength - of trumps Is declared
against you, this mere fact alone is not
sufficient ground for you to force your
partner, \ particularly if ; you are very
wea"k In trumps; the fact of your being
very weak might indicate that your part
ner had fair strength. |
Usually, however, . it Is best to offer
partner the opportunity, , as ' he can ex
ercise his . own judgment \ In â¢ taking the
force. If the opponent calls and the other
echoes strength, you can unhesitatingly
force him. Also if the opponent's tr^imp
lead shows very, great strength you can
force himV;^^ ,.'
When ypu are forced by your, adversary,
or unintentionally forced by your partner,
here is an. opportunity for you to,exerÂ»
else your own good Judgment.
-â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦.-Â¦ â¢. . \ . Â» â¢ â¢rr,i
If you are forced intentionally or other
wise by your opponent, second hand, your
position is worthy of due deliberation.
| If you ' refuse to take the force your
partner will understand that you have
four, good trumps arid a fair suit. and will
lead you a trump at the first opportunity,
as , there j can be no more Imperative call
for trump than this. |
It. is just as important to. know. when
to " force your ' adversary as it is when
not to force your partner.
If it is good play to foreÂ© your partner
when he Is weak in trumps it is certainly
any advantage ' to force v the adversaries
when they are strong. ' If you are forcing
the adversary -and he refuses to take the
force,- force him again.
Great care should be taken that you
are forcing the strong hand, and not the
weak one. Of all the exasperating situa
tions at the whist table is to have your
partner give the strong hand a discaru
and the weak hand a force. Â¦
Early in the game, if you are weak in
trumps, do not hesitate to force' the op
ponent if. early In- the play if he shows
he is void of your suit, as It nearly al
ways turns out that you are forcing' the
strong hand.

In regard to the first rule of hot forc
ing your- partner when weak in trumps
it applies of course to the early part of the
hand, before there has been any declara
tion of strength or weakness. The ob
ject of not torcing \ your partner when
weak in trunms is clear; you weaken
him and strengthen the opponents. For
instance, if you force your partner when
holding but two trumps and your partner
takes the force holding four, this, leaves
the adversary with the long trump; for
the sake of a trick made by the force, you
may render comparatively worthless a
good hand and place yourself and partner
at the mercy of your adversaries. My ad

in thm dynamo room, the hottest spot in
thÂ« ship, where the temperature often
reaches 120 degrees. In the ammunition
passages men are shining the brass plates
which connect with the sliding doors in
thÂ« angina room* below, and which by
manipulation can b* closed to prevent
possibility of the engines being flooded.
Perhaps the two "moat unpopular spots
on a naval vessel are the sick bay or hos
pital, with its clean white cots, and the
"brig." or prison, with its cells of heavy
painted iron, in which are men confined
for .various periods, on a diet of bread and
water. Before the loophole of the door
paces a marine," relieved every two hours
times called the "sailor's piano."
. Bailors are versed In 'many trades, and
ft has been said that should a battleship:
be wrecked' on" an uninhabited island a
small town could be completely built by
tha vessel's - creV, as some man could be
found for almost any ' kind of work to be
performed. .
A not uncommon sight on a naval ves
sel Is bronzed ; and stalwart seamen using
bend-power sewing machines. These men
'make uniforms from regulation cloth pur
chased from the paymaster, and maka
not only their . : own ' clothing, .- many oi
them, but receive orders from their ship
mates. Several barbers are useful on Â»'
battleship, and they are . generally kept
pretty busy; after the general \muster,
which takes place on the quarterdeck on
the . first Sunday of each month. 3 Each
man's name is called, he answers his rat
ing, and as the sailors say, "walks around \
a stick." If long hair is one of his visible
discrepancies he Is sent to the barber.
The crew of the Wisconsin have two
baseball teams and have only lost one
game, out of ; twenty T ln a v year.-'' Their

the Wisconsin yell;V.

Are we, in it? Yes, we are.
Wisconsin! Wisconsin 1 Rah! rah! rah!
In the quarters of .the^wardroom offt-
cera all Is serene and qtitat at this hoar
of the day. â The white-gloved orderly sits
on the alert before the door of the ad
miral's cabin. .Though Rear Admiral
Casey, as commander in chief of the Pa
cific squadron, make* his official home on
the Wisconsin, he has no direct command
over this particular ship, and all orders
come through Captain George A. Relter,
In command. To an onlooker, the . main
business of the day for the officers of a
battleship when not,, ln^ action 'iÂ« to bÂ©
present and direct the many, drills. . .
At ten minutes before noon the omni
present bugle sounds mesa gear and be
low there la a great rattle of tables being
let down, -They are all hung by wires to
tT the callers In double quick time. An
other most realistic drill is what is known
a* "abandon ship." This is practiced reg
ularly, so that in caae It becomes a real
ity that the ship is In collision or has
been rammed in action, every one knows
what to do. The boats are manned, the
men respond to the captain's call of "step
lively there.'* and everything needful la
passed to the bo?ta. The whistles sound
a signal that the ship is sinking and all
water-tight doors are to be dosed. There
Is a call or two from the division officers:
"All ready, sir," and In a few moments
more the drill Is over, and the decks re
sound with tramping feet to the sound of
the bufle calling retreat from drill. Ev
ery three months target practice goes on.
when the decks are cleared as in action
and great guns as well as revolvers are.
brought into use.
Sometimes this practice will be when
tne ship Is under way at sea, at other
times record practice takes place In the
harbor. In the past year the Wisconsin
has broken the record for a Ions cruiie,
having: made 19,000 miles in twelve months.
After daily drills are over, the division
officers and others all report to the exec
utive officer. The officer of the deck on
a battleship is also an important person
age, even though a new officer relieves
him every four hours. He has everything (
In charge, and must be notified of any
thin? done. Happenings In his depart
ment find a place In the ship's log.
At 7 bells or 3:30 p. m. the bosun's mata
pipes which means every
thing is to be swept down fore and aft.
And as the sailors say, "all the splt-kito
are emptied out." Then again Jacky Is
at leisure for a time, and the "smoking
lamp" Is supposed to be lit. Boxing, bag
punching, cards, are some of the amuse
ments, and the string band which the
men have among: themselves may gather
}n the barber shop for practice. The two
goats, the "possum and a cat. which are
tbÂ« snip's mascots, come In for their
share of attention. Perhaps there Is some
talk of going ashore and hitting the
"dog," as whisky Is known to the sailors.
On Wednesday and Saturday much time
Is given to mending clothes^ seeing visi
tors, etc Swimming exercise and instruc
tion Is had dally when circumstances will
permit. After dark searchlights are exer
cised and night signals go on. There are
many other drills during a week too nu
merous to mention here. The Sunday
routine is much the same with the addi
tion of the captain's inspection and morn
ing service by the "sky pilot." There i3
plenty of yarn spinning in the afternoon.
At five minutes to 5 p. m. sounds the
officers* call for evening quarters at 5.
Once more comes the familiar call of mess
gear, and pipe to supper at three bells.
At four bells "turn to" sounds again, but
not much work goes on. Soon the band
ceases to play on the quarterdeck. On
Wednesday and Saturday nights the sail
or* usually have a ball on the fo'cas'le.
The executive officer^ goes around at
six bells and inspects the lower decks
again. "Hammocks" Is sounded at 7:30
and "Jimmylegs" goes around to chase
up the men again. ' Then the bosun's
mate pipes down, the hammocks are
slung and at eight balls the anchor watch
lay aft to muster. Tattoo sounds at 9
and five minutes later booms out the
evening gun.- Then comes the slow notes
of "Taps" or all lights out and all hands
turn t in save the quartermaster. tha an
chor watch and the signal boy.
But not so peaceful is a night when the
ship Is In action. Then the picket boats
are out. There are watches on starboard
and port, and men at different points on
deck to report anything floating In sight.
The guns are manned and all lights are
out except In the fire room. There may
be a long last sleep for some before tha

v. hen "Turn to" piped on the whistle
by thÂ»: boVun's mate puts every man

busy lot. some of them cleaning ship,
ethers scrubbing and washing clothes.
This v.ork is ktpt up until twenty min
ute* past seven when the bugler's call

Mess gear means in the language of a
landsman to "prepare .for breakfast."
whieli on shipboard is called for 7:80 oi

Eight b*lls rings out to the sound of
the "Star Spangled Banner" played by
the ships Land. The flag is being raised
and every man on the ship faces aft and
ealutes, as Old Glcry reaches the truck.
The quarterdeck is the official hall of the
ship, eo to speak. All the dignitariesNd'ho
visit the shop are received on the star
board side of the quarterdeck, known as
the official side of the ship. Here is thÂ«
scene of any important naval ceremony,
and here the ship's band plays every
morning and afternoon. There is no more
Inspiring music than that of a ship's band
as It comes in bursts over the water on a
still afternoon. The band of a warship
usually plays well, for It spends from ten

regard the port side of the ship as more
especially their own field.
Deck bright work and gun bright work

ere ehlniner brass for the half hour until
one bell rings again. If one on land should
go by. bells the four-hour system of a
ship would probably mix him at first
worse than It does on board, but like
many other things. It is simple after one
knows it. If nothing else had to be done
on a warship it is a task to keep the
men-kiliers bright and shining, and one
can always see men oiling and polishing
the runs to keep them from rusting. On
the Wisconsin there are forty-eight of
them. After the brass work is all like
Tnlrrors, the next thing on the programme
Is for all hands to get into uniform and
clear up all decks for Inspection.
At two bells the executive officer in
spects the lower decks. He has one or
two straight military figures In his wake,
as does every officer when he moves In
the navy. At this same hour the gun
captain begins the inspection, training
and testing of the monster guns in the
turrets. They revolve by electricity, the
motive power that brings up on a hoist
from below right to the breech of the
gun a semi-circular car of ammunition.

the one Inactive while the other emits

"Speaking only from what I have read
of the recent eruption in Martinique, and
from what we know geologically and his
torically of the region, I am of the opin
ion that inasmuch as there was , more
than. one eruption, it appearing that there
was also one on St. Vincent, there will
be no Immediate successive eruption.- The
tendency . will be to subside, now that
some n relief has been afforded the vol

X Yale University. "They are not
well understood by any one, for the

"The modern scientific theory of the
emission of lava Is simply that the tre
mendous pressure upon the rocks, down a
few miles, Is so great that despite the in
tense heat they are kept not quite mol
ten, almost solid, perhaps. â¢
"When the explosion takes place, reliev
ing the 'pressure, It happens oftentimes
that the rocks turn from : their solidified
state to a melttn condition. Man spoke of
"Out In our own Yellowstone] Park the
geysers are instances of this steam gen
eration. The volcanoes there have not
been active for thousands of years, but
the earth has not cooled very far down
yet, and the steaming water that spouts
out and up is in the nature of its action
volcanic. In Mexico not very long ago
there was one volcano, long inactive,
upon which the rocks were still so hot
that one could light a cigar by touching
the end of it to the. stone.
"A volcanic eruption is, on a grand
scale, an explosion caused by the gener
ation of steam in the great boiler under
the surface. I am of the opinion that
there were some great crevices in the
vicinity of the island of Martinique,
through which water either percolated
for many years or by the subsiding of
the sea a great inrush of water took
place. The fact that the sea is said - to
have sunk a number of feet there would
seem to indicate that there Is a . very
great crack or crevice somewhere, and
that the water that rushed in was great
in volume. That produced a generation
of steam* which found vent through the
craters of the two volcanoes.
VULCANOLOGISTS" of to-day are
as much at a loss to define the
volcano as were the geologists and
astronomers of the days of Dar
win.
"Vulcanlty" Js as much a stupendous
mystery to the Christian students and
observers now hurrying to the scene of
tho unparalleled disaster at Martinique as
was the new coined word of heathen ori
gin to the Latin survivors who gazed in
awe upon the ruins of Pompeii. Similar
were the conditions; similar the ignor
ance of the spectator.
Among the first and best equipped of
epecial students to leave for St. Pierre
was Dr. E. O. Hovey, curator of the de
partment of geology In the American
Museum of Natural History. I found
him rushing to make ready for his de
parture the next day on the Government
relief ship Dixie.
There was only time for him to speak
in a general way of the previous Investi
gations of leading geologists. He was
mindful mostly of the large opportunity
opening to him for personal observation,
but be outlined certain salient results of
the studies of such men as Professors
Dana, Russell, Judd, Bonney and â¢ Hill,
the last named having prepared a mono
graph on volcanic conditions In the West
Indies. From Dr. Hovey's suggestions
and other sources this sketch of the
known facts about volcanoes has been
carefully compiled.
The number of great habitual volcanic
vents upon the globe Is estimated at be
tween three hundred and three hundred
and fifty. There is but one on the whole
continent of Europe, Vesuvius, though
elsewhere in the Mediterranean there are
Bixâ Stromboli and Vulcano, in the Li
parl Islands; Etna, in Sicily; Grahams
Island, a submarine volcano off the
Sicilian coast, and Santorlus and Nisyros,
In the Aegean Sea. The African conti
nent Is known to contain ten active vol
canoes, four on the west and six on the
east coast, and there are about ten
others on neighboring Islands. In Asia,
there are twenty-four active volcanoes,
but no less than twelve of these are situ
ated on the peninsula of Kamchatka.
There are no volcanoes in Australia.
The American continent contains Â¦ m'orÂ«
than the countries of the Old World
twenty In North America, twenty-five In
Central America and thirty-seven In
South America. Thus, taken altogether,
there are about 117 volcanoes on the great
continents and nearly twice as many on
the Islands scattered over the several
oceans.
THE MYSTERY OF "VULCANITY."
These volcanoes usually assume in their
distribution, a linear arrangement, and
nearly all of them have been thrown up
along three well-marked bands ' and the
branches ; proceeding from them. ,
The whole eastern coast ) of both the
Americas was thought to: be entirely free
from volcanoes of anything like recent
date, and, just as Professor Judd a few
years ago complacently asserted, "as a
matter of fact, the actual amount ''of
damage to life and property which is af
fected by volcanic eruptions is small,"
so Professor Benney declared that the
whole western border of the I Atlantic is
destitute of volcanic activity, "were 'Jit
not for the long island chain of the Les-;
ser Antilles which' separates that' ocean
from the Caribbean Sea."
R. T. Hill made a special study of
conditions in Â¦ the Windward Islands. It
had been well known that many of the
West 'Indian Islands are of limestone,
chiefly coraline; that some contain crys
talline rocks, while jj others are volcanic.
Quite recently it was noted that seven
craters still gave signs of life by emit
ting steam and that tho curving line of
volcanic vents occurred on a. submarine
plateau between . the 'deep basin of the
Central Atlantic and -that of : the Carib
bean Sea. The activity of the Souf riere
o~ Bt Vincent was remarked' years ago.
the red hot mud that poured down tha
mountain. When that matter comes to
the cooler air at the surface, especially
if there is water with it, it is broken up
into fine particles by atmospheric influ
ences, and falls for great distances in
the form of what people descilbe as ashes.
They are not ashes, however, but par
ticles of lava.
"As to whether there will be sympa
thetic action of volcanoes in other parts of
the world, I rather doubt that. I think
the easement is local, as was the disturb
ance, and that there will be no effect at
any great distances. The thunder and
lightning which accompanied, or followed,
the eruption in Martinique were due to the
fact that tho tension of the electric forces
in the air was disturbed. The disturb
ances in the center of the earth being very
great and having an upward tendency in
relieving, there follow great changes in
the configuration of the territories. Great
masses of rocks slide and the earth opens.
That is an earthquake effect. It is pos
sible that those effects are felt at great
distances.
"Volcanoes are peculiar 1 in their action.
We really know but very little about
them. Scientists collect all the data pos- ,
sible and study them carefully, but un
fortunately it is not possible to study ;
them in action with safety. You know,
down at the bottom of the rich Comstock
lode, thf^atmosphere is still so hot that it ,
costs more to cool the air than the gold i
is worth when mined, and volcanoes have
not been active in our country for a loss
time."
UNCERTAINTY OF VOLCANOES.
Martinique last week and the still greater
eruption of Krakatoa, in the Straits of
Sunda, southeast of Asia, in 1883. So great
was the eruption of Krakatoa that vt
filled the atmosphere of the whole world
with minute volcanic dust, which for
months produced the crimson glow of
sunrise and sunset, so noticeable even In
this country. At that time a wave was
produced in the sea which overwhelmed
many cities on the neighboring coast and
was recognizable around all the conti
nents. '
While the volcanic activity of the Wind
ward Islands appears to be dying out.
still all these mentioned as having cones
are liable to reawakening activity, . but
less- so than those at the extreme north
ern end of the chain. The tension on the
earth's crust having been somewhat re-
lleved by the eruptions at Martinique and
St. Vincent, early activity would not bÂ«
expected.
Wherever there are chains of cones,
with one occasionally active, there is al
ways danger of other cones bursting Into
eruption, and most dangerous of all are
those peaks which have been quiescent so
long that their dangerous character has
been forgotten. ;â¢-*Â¦'
Some of the earthquakes of these isl-.
ands arise directly from the volcanic
activity of the inner chain. They come
from the slipping of the earth's crust,
such as that at Charleston, far removed
from volcanoes. There is no reason : to
suppose, however, that our Atlantic bor
der should be permanently free from
earthquakes any more than the coast of
Carolina.
It must not be supposed that the
whole of the Windward chain was born
oÂ» volcanoes such as we see, in the ele
vated peaks of to-day. In fact, the
foundations of all are of very great age,
although they were carved out by trie
atmosphere and the rains from older vol
canic materials, but so ancient as not to
be the ancestors of the modern cones.
Indeed, the southern part of Martinique,
greater volcanoes* Many of these are, fre
quently in a state of activity. Thus we
find Orizaba, a cone rising to a height of
about 10,000 feet above the ancient Mexi
can plateau, which itself is 8000 feet above
the level of the sea. Colima, only a short
distance south of Mexico City, is fre
quently in eruption. Â¦ Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦'
In Guatemala, Santa Maria, which gave
rise to the terrible destruction on April
18, began to be active last November, and
is now said to be more active than any
volcano known in America since Spanish
â¢occupation. While that is near the Mexi
can frontier, Chingo, on the Salvador bor
der, is also in a state of general activity.
Never So Many Eruptions as Now.
Again in Alaska another, volcano is in
eruption. . f
â¢ So many widespread Eruptions in__the
northern continent have never been
known in the historic period. Â¦'Â¦
Some twenty-five miles south of Guate
mala City is the old site of the city itself,
one of the most magnificent spots in the
world and having a most delightful cli
mate. Nestled in a beautiful valley among
the mountains lies the city of Antigua.
From one side rises the regular solitary
volcanic cone of Agua, while a little fur
ther away, on the other side, Is the vol
cano of Fuegoand its companion.
Â¦ Fuego ia said to be always Â¦ hot. Â¦â, The
crater of Agua' was filled with water
when in the middle of the sixteenth cen
tury it burst 'and overwhelmed the orig
inal site by a flood and buried It in vol
canic , ashes. The- city was moved three
miles farther away. and grew to be one of
great magnificence. In 1781 an earthquake
leveled it, leaving the ruins: of seventy
six churches alone, some of great mag
nificence. Then the city ' was moved to
its present site, twenty-five miles away
over the mountains. â¢
' - Iceland and the Hawaiian Islands are
examples of isolated cones rising out of
the* deep oceanic abysses. At' recurring
places along the whole Andes there is a
successions of great volcanoes, oft general
ly greater magnitude than in the north
ern hemisphere. Â¦ "'.;Â¦' Â¦ â¢ '
While there have .been -many great
earthquakes recorded, still - there nave
been only two eruptions . vividly before us
equal to that of- ancient Vesuvius, and
both of these within our memoryâ that of
tween the two continents, such, for in
stance, as the small elephant found in
Guadeloupe; other animals in Anguilla as
large as Virginia deer and the "remains of
extinct animals reached even the region
of Philadelphia from South America by
way of this bridge in the early pleisto
cene period.
During this period of high elevation the
deep canyons were formed upon the sur
face, which cut up the continent now
forming the Windward Island region into
a number of hills and valleys, which,
upon the subsequent subsidence, left only
the isolated chain of islands which we
calif the Windward group; but the sub
sidence reduced even these islands to a
smaller area than we now find, owins
to the subsequent rise in the land, which
enlarged their area, but the drowning of
the Island land just mentioned, and which
occurred in the middle of the pleistocene
period, after the early glacial epoch, ex
terminated the animals of the islands,
which have not since been repopulated,
as such could not migrate thither frpm
either continent owing to the broad in
tervening straits.
Represent the Sunken Continent.
In a general way, the Windward Isl
ands represent the sunken continent.
Central America and Mexico illustrate the
earth's movements accompanied by vol
canic activity of the western region
which has been raised into high plateaus
while the eastern region had been sink
ing. Thus in that region we can see a
repetition of the features discovered by
the soundings about the Windward Isl
ands.
These two great lines of volcanic activ
ity, situated thousands of miles apart,
have no connection with each other what
ever, and the coincidence of stupendous
activity occurring in the two localities
only goes to show that terrestrial move
ments are now In progress along both
margins of the continents. These move
ments are along lines of weakness. In
the first place, great heat is developed
by the great friction. In the second
place, these weak lines facilitate the es
cape of the molten matter which may
arise, either through a friction of the
earth's crust of from the cisterns of
lava beneath.

Dr. Spencer, accompanied by Mrs. Spencer, has just reached Washington, aft

The investigations which called Dr. Spencer to Central America included a
study of the stupendous changes of level of land and sea in recent geological
times and the object in visiting Central America was for the .study of the physical
features of that region in comparison with the submarine features of the Wind
ward Island::, eo vividly presented to the public at the present moment.

/\ /I tions of the origin of our great
I Y I lakes ix - vras fo un d tnat lne con "
V * I tinent stood at "least 3000 feet
JL higher than at the present time
during the ages when the great> lakes'
valleys were being carved out by the
rains, rills and rivers. These investiga
tions revealed the occurrence of deep,
i iverlike valleys extending seaward across
the submerged margin of the continent.
Carrying the investigations further south
to the coast of Florida and the Bahama
Islands and Cuba, it was found that these
submerged valleys form the continental
rivers, barrancas and canyons, such as
are seen at the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado, in Arizona, in Mexico and Cen
tial America. Such valleys originate In
high plateaus of 6000 to 10,000 feet alti
tude and extend down to low level plains
and the sea.
As these valleys extend down to the
floor of the Gulf of Mexico and the Carib
bean Sea they become evidence that the
West Indian Islands once stood as high
as these riverlike valleys are now sub
merged beneath the sea. Thus the Inves
tigation showed that the Windward Isl
ands and the Bahamas and, indeed, the
whole eastern part of the American con
tinent stood once at more than two miles
above the present altitude. Herein, as
we shall see, lie the causes of the volcanic
disturbances resulting In such great dis
aster.
Gulf of Mexico Brained Into Pacific.
At the time North and South America
were bridged together by way of the
Windward Islands Mexico and Central
America were low and the valley of what
Is now the Gulf of Mexico was drained
into the Pacific Ocean across Mexico by
way of the Tehuantepec isthmus, and the
valley of the Caribbean Sea discharged
Its waters into the Pacific Ocean. Then
the Windward Islands formed the back
bone of the now submerged continent.
While this continent existed long before
the historical period, yet from the stand
point of the geologist it was very recent,
so that In the early glacial period North
and South America were connected and
stood at an altitude of two miles or more.
During the changes of level of laud and
sea, which occupied a long period, there
were many migrations of animals be-

again begins in the Bahamas, the re
mains of great coastal plains like those
along our Atlantic, which escaped the
destruction of the West Indian region
when it stood at the elevation formerly
mentioned. This outward chain is no

quake action, and throughout these isl
ands great damage is periodically pro
duced.

South America, a vast number of small
islands rising above a submarine plateau
now less than 200 feet below the sea. .
or less restricted in the area of action
and to the distance occupied by the
chains of cones, the earth movements are
very much more widely felt in the form

bisected by the valley of the mountain
torrent, which made an excellent path
way for. the lava and the volcanic mud
â¢which overwhelmed the city. In thesa
volcanic eruptions the great danger is
not so much from the streams of lava as
fiom the streams of mud formed by the
condensing steam and hot ashes blown ott
the top of the mountain by the explo
sions of vapor produced by the infiltration
of waters into the molten lava itself.
The greater West Indian islands have
scarcely any traces of volcanic eruptions
except in ancient times. .
Whole sheets of igneous matter occur
along the eastern sicies of our North and
South American mountains, still there are
no remains of volcanic cones in Eastern
America except a few in the vicinity of

Who is Tonnmy Atkins?
The most noiableMnstar.ee of thfs fact
that I have ever had to deal with was
Parnell. Ah, he was a game lion, but
after he became a murderer his courage
Bcemed to desert him. There was a sluft"
in his sand after he killed Thienann at
the California Fair and another fall-off !n
his grit when he assassinated the hired
man at my California farm by jerking
l:m through the bars when he wasn't
'.ookir.R and tearing him to pieces.
As I said before, forest-bred lions are
the easiest to deal with. Parneil was tho
only exception I have known. I caught
him myself in Algeria when I was trav
eling with the European United Shows.
He had been a particularly dangerous
jungle beast for years when I first heard
of him. and such wondrous stories were
toid of his size and prowess that I de
termined to have him. With my assist
ants to help mo I set a trap for himâ a
beil-shjiped snare, large at the bottom
Â«ud small at the topâ covered It over with
J;rush and put a kid on it. This trap
The reason for this is plain even to one
v.ho has had only a passing acquaintance
with animals. The spectacular beast is
frankly and openly and consistently hos
tile. He makes no secret of his overmas
tering desire to devour the trainer at a
siugie meal. He has never known Â«=ub
rjission 19 anything or anybody. He docs
not want to be tamed and he is not going
to be if he can possibly avoid it. He is
always bristling for a tight, and will kill
v< the first opportunity.
This i:. as it should b*>. "Forewarned is
forearm t.l." Trie trailer therefore is
ric-vt-r oli his guard, but meets brute force
with brute force.
On the other hand, the animal that has
been "tarried" is in reality the tartar. His
very docility is the badge of his treachery.
He has only concealed his blunt savagery
under a low cunning the better to striko
with greater certainty of killing when the
trainer has been beguiled into careiess-
Ets-s by an unwonted show of amiability.
This is particulariy true of the lion, all
stories of his nobleness to the contrary
notwithstanding.
Take the lionâ Wallace at the Chutes,
for Instance (though he is the only ex
ception to this hard and fast rule that I
have ever brought to submission), the
"good shower" is the safest. By "good
shower" I mean the animal that goes
bounding about the cage, snarling aha
roaring in a perfect frenzy when the
trainer enters, which, though it looks
awe-inspiring and terrifying, is really less
dangerous than the beast that fav/ns at
tiie feet of the trainer or rubs against him
affectionately.
THE first and most important thing
to learn about training wild ani
mals .for the zoo is that they are
never what they seem. Those that
appear to be the most docile are in
reality the most dangerous. This is es
pecially true of the beast born in captiv
ity, as contrasted with the forest-bred
animal.

everything was all right.

â¢was well laid in the usual path
of the beasts to a lagoon, and when Par
nell came along he leaped at the kid and
down he went. A cage had been put at
tbe bottom of the pit, and as soon as
Parnell entered it he was drawn up. And
there he was In captivity.
1 never saw a lion who hated the degra
dation more, but this very spirit made
him an excellent "show" animal. In thres
days I was performing with him, much to
hit> surprise.
Contrary to the usual "methods followed
by animal trainers, I always ' begin the
task cf subjugation at the very rtrst meet
ing. I learned the value of this at my
debut as a lion tamer.
Jt v.-as in f C6, at the Norvell House,
where I was laying over after the war.
There was a show in town and one n'ght
a fellow came along, a huge, villainous
lookinK chap, who turned out to be the
lion tamer of the show, famous for his
dash and dare-devil courage. Well, we
â¢were talking there and drinking:, and I
asked the fellow who and what he was.
He told me he was a lion tamer, and
asked me who I was.
"Why, I manage wild beasts myself,"
said I. J
'â¢Wr.at's your 'show?" said he.
"Davis" show," said I.
The fellow didn't catch on. and I went
on.
"Bob Lee's been managing the show."
Ami still he did not comprehend, but he
looked at me hard, as if he doubted that
I could tame beasts. I'd been', in com
mand of the Louisiana Tigers after Bob
Wheat's death during the Civil War, and
that was what I was referring to when I
spoke of handling wild beasts.
Then jurt for the devilment of the
thing I offered to bet the fellow a couple
of baskets cf champagne that I'd enter
the cage where his wild beasts were kept
and do anything that he'd do. To my ut
ter- consternation he took the bet and
there I started out as a lion tamer. . \
I remember the next morning when I
started out to the shows. I looked up
or the hill and saw the tents standing
still and white, reminding me for all the
world of tombs.
However, I watched the fellow close
and when he came out I went in with
a pistol in one hand, a whip In the other
and a lump in my throat big and hard
as a hickory nut. I never whipped lions
and tigers with so much vigor in my life.
There I was with my teeth set, a ter
rific scowl on my face', Jumping round
like mad, shooting the beasts in the face-.
with a pepper box pistol loaded with
heavy wads of paper and laying about
me with my whip for all I was worth.
Wonderful to relate everybody thought
I had the most complete control over the
beasts because I even made them jump,
and the fun of It all was that every
movement I was expecting to be gobbled
up whole. The result; in a fortnight I
got a flattering offer to be lion tamer for
a big show and I took It.
With my right hand free I fired a vol
ley- full into his eyes. The powder burn
ed and blinded him and he let go, but
only for an instant, when he sprang at
me again, his jaws closing with a snap
ever my elbow a second time. Again I
fired a volley of blank cartridges into hi3
.his eyes and again he let go, only to
spring at me a third time with greater
ferocity. This time his heavy jaws near
ly severed my left arm at the elbow, but
though the pain was something awful the
sense of my -langer and the certain
knowledge that a lion only attacks three
times and if it fails then will abandon
the fight for good kept me from fainting.
Once again I fired a volley at him and
my assistants arriving opportunely we
beat him back Into a corner and I slipped
Jout from the eagre soaked in blood amidst
terrific excitement. Then to allay the
nars of the audience and prevent a panic
ferocity made a tremendous hit. He was
a "good shower" in every sense of the
terra and I feared his savagery far less
than the servile cunning of the animals
born and trained In captivity.
-'But by the close of the first week he
had got accustomed to the whip and even
the Dlstol and in the midst of the per
formance he suddenly turned. I knew
what was coming the moment I saw him
drop from thft top of the cage where be
had been clinging to the. bars in a very
fierzy of rage, and crouch for a spring.
There was absolutely no chance of es
cape and instinctively I threw up my left
arir. to ward him off. His Jaws closed
ov&i: my elbow with such crunching force
f'nat \he bone was shattered into slivers.
Luckily I was standing with my back to
the bars and though the impact of his
body against mine was terrific I was pre
vented from falling by the wall of the
ct.-re.
In contrast to the cannibalistic animals,
the bear i3 much more docile, though far
less intelligent than the Hon. I've always
maintained that the grizzly Is the king of
beasts. I've hunted animals In all parts
of the world, but I've never seen anything
that can equal a grizzly for pugnacity
and courage. There isn't any more flinch
In an American grizzly than there is In a
steel rip saw. But he is not a fighter by
nature, as the lion and tiger are, though
he can easily whip either of them. All
that the bear requires Is to be well fed,
and then with patience he can be taught
anythingâ the small black and brown
bears especially.
First teach him to know you by leading
him at the end of a chain, then to climb
upon a pedestal, stand on his hind legs,
roll a barrel and so on until his education
Is complete. It must all be in the nature
of pure fun. however.
The jaguar, the leopard and the hyena,
though the latter is always considered, so
dangerous, are all really as tractable as
the domestic cat. Feed them well and pet
them, and as soon as they realize that
you are friendly they can be led about
like pet dogs. " r
Much surprise is often expressed that
a kangaroo can be taught anything at
ail, particularly boxing. This In reality
is very simple. The attitude of the fighter
is absolutely natural to the animal, and

In this way he can be made- to stand up

COLONEL DANIEL E. BO0NT3, soldier of fortune j lion tamer and
circus manager, fresh from his Mexican experiences -with Parnell,
the famed murderous lion that was gored to death by a Toltec
bull after fighting a sanguinary draw with' the Wombwell grizzly,
and still more recently from an adventure in New York with a newly
captured jungle lion, is come to take charge of the animals in the zoo at
the new Chutes. That means that he must get personally acquainted
with all of them, and teach them collectively and individually ho\7 and
why he is master of the whole jungle colony. He has accomplished
that task in less than two weeks, and the manner of his conquest, as he
tells it in the following article, is absolutely unique.
Colonel Boone has been training animals for thirtyrsix years.
There is not a beast of any sort known to modern zoology which he has
not trained in one way or another, and with the exception of Australia,
he has performed in every country of the globe. This contribution there
fore is one of the most valuable and interesting animal stories ever
published in a newspaper. %
Now the forest-bred lion Is bold and
audacious, the most daring of the whole
animal kingdom, but It will never kill
unless It Is hungry, as the tiger does
for pure love of killing, nor â stealthily
in the sneaking manner peculiar to the
tiger and all otter members of the cat
family.
The lion cannot be controlled by mere
persuasive power. He must be conquered
boldly, fearlessly, quickly, and so it was

Bartell'a lion his dash and spirit and
sisted that I would have to have my arm
amputated. I protested.
"I'll have to cut oft thÂ© 'funny bone'
anyway," he said.
"There's nothing funny about that," I
replied, "though I won't bÂ© ticklish here
after."
In the evening, with my arm bound In
splints, I performed with him as usual.
Though he seemed more savage than ever,
he had learned that I was master.
Wallace at the Chutes learned the same
lesson In Just three days, too. Now I

pistol pocket, when he is up on his feat

This method of subjugating the man-eat

test ever since my startling debut, though
it nearly cost me my life about a month
ago in Xevv York. As it is I shall never
again have the use of my left *>ia, which
was so badly maxisled that I feared; for
a time that it would have to be ampu

It was at Bartell's, the' big Importer of
animals, that I first saw this oneâ a for

It fascinated me at iirst glance. .
"Kartell," I said," "I'd like to borrow
that lion." / .
"What for?" he asked.

8no_textof such eyes a pretty story Is told. A
man who was devoted to astronomy, and,
from a timid nature, seemed doomed to
bachelorhood was asked one day by a
friend:
"Have you' over observed Miss 's
eyes? They have the property of double
refraction." "Dear nw, that is very odd,"
he exclaimed.' "I should like to see that
Do you think I might venture to call?"
And call he did and begged permission ta
examine the young woman's eyes.
The novelty of the situation fascinated
him. He begged the privilege of a sec
ond look at the eyes In a clear light. Tha
problem grew so Interesting that he at
length came to the conclusion to make It
a life study. The boldness born of scien
tific curicsity cnaolcd him ultfÂ»-oÂ»Â»ly to
propose.* He was accepted, and the
strange courtship ended in a'happy mar
riage. Â¦ , " *
Hygiene of the Eyes.
There are very few. women 'nowadays
who resort to the injurious . practice of
dropping' belladonna into ' the' eyes to
brighten them. It is absolutely â¢ ruinous
to the sight, and gives the eyes an arti
ficial look, as unbecoming as that pro
duced by a hard, dark line under the
lower lashes.
The paint used . to darken the under
eyelids Is -often made up of injurious sub
stances, which In time make' the flesh
around the* eyes old and wrinkled.
Good digestion Is the best aid to beau
tiful eyes, for a disordered stomach shows
Â«?-*!# in the vellowish vhitesof.the eyÂ«s.
Bathe the eyes the last thing before re
tiring and the first thing in the morning.
Use warm water. If the eyes are? tired.
bathing "them in mild, cold tea or weak
Ealt ; water or. warm . milk rests them.
Simply bathe the outer skin," with eyes
closed. A soft 'linen "cloth; which" Is used
for no other purpose, is. the best for bath
ing the eyesv '
There is a prevalent belief that a dally
cold water bath of the eyesâ opening and
shutting the eyes under waterâ Is benefi
cial and tends to strengthen the eyes. It
may render the eye somewhat more re
slstant to external Influences, such as
cold, but it can in no way affect the sight
itself. v
Close the eyes, once in every two or
three hours, for five or ten minutes at a
time. Always close the eyes when you
have nothing. to do. So long as they are
open they are to a certain extent at work.
If the eyes are not rested now and then
sharp. It is a great mistake to shape
the nail into the very long sharp point,
for It breaks easily and is dangerous.
There, is a point called the Langtry nail.
The nail grows high at each. side of the
finger so as to keep it In shapes then
come to the point, which ns almost a
blunt one. A very high polish finishes the
nail.
The Pink Rim.
The question of cleansing the nail Is
probably the first one that occurs to a
woman who has to do . her own mani
curing. If the nail be scraped under
neath, either with the cleaner or with the
orange wood stick, it soon grows white
and a great unsightly rim disfigures the
tip. '..-.-Â¦
Now, a pretty nail should be pink almost
to the finger end; and there should be
scarcely any whitish rim.
To obtain this pinkish appearance dean
the nail as little as possible. ' When wash-
Eyes having the property of double re
fraction are not .common; about a pair
Only second to the eyes in importance
are the eyebrows. A follower of Buddha
dares heaven to show him anything finer
in its way than the dusky crescents over
his lady's eyes, curved and soft as a but
terfly's pinicr.s. He more often writes
sonnets to his inistress' eyebrows than to
her eyes. Finely arched eyebrows in a
v/orr.an indicate a character fond of mu
sic, artistic pursuits, dress, pleasure and
appreciative of loveliness wherever it ap
pears. â¢
The blue eye wins by kindness: the
black by power; the gray by intellect, and
the brown by love. ,
: Dtep-eol^red eyes, with well arched
lids, Â¦ lint h upper and lower, show a truth
ful an'd affectionate r.ature. There is one
thing, hov/ever, to be remembered about
b?aek eyesâ don't arouse them. They are
capable of taking vengeance, seldom for
get an injury and will bide their time.
Both black and brown eyes indicate
frankness, warm affection and a great de
gree of character. Blue eyes, full of tac
tics, keep their secrets well; but thsy
make warm friends, being- amiable, truth
fu! and affectionate. .The Greeks, who
admired blue eyes, fondly called Minerva
"the blue-eyed maid," and Neptune "the
god of the azure eyes." Venus, too, had
blue eves.
In the Orient no .woman can be beauti
ful who has not laige, dreamy eyes. In
Italy and Spain a pair of bijr eyes, even
if expressionless, are enough to entitle a
woman to be called a beauty, but in
America a woman with very large eyes
and no other charms is never rated as a
Wauty. Usually more' indicative 'of power
than of beauty are large eyes. Too full,
they denote a timid and -stupid, even
treÂ£;cherous;nature. Juno had "large, ma
jestic eyes'': Homer describes her as "ox
eyed." Fairly large and bright eyes, show
qrick perception and an intense nature.
Small eyes are indicative, of . an alert
mir.d,. of wit, cleverness, spontaneity.
Long eyes, belong to a poetic tempera
ment;- .they . proclaim . a dreamy . nature,
contented and nÂ«t aspiring. Hound eyes
are. ambitious. Deep-set eyes show
'thong htfulness and logic. Proiru<T.ng eyes
show love of action and are indicative of
fine conversational powers.
Heavy lids, which in a manner unroll
over the eyes, have always been thought
beautiful, perhaps because they imply
large. eyes. A Persian stakes his all on a
woman with heavy lided eyes and mas
sive eyebrows curving heavily down on the.
temples. Such eyebrows denote a jealous
nature, and jealousy is flattering to the
masculine mind in Persia.
ery one will declare is charmingâfascinat
ing. Soft and melting eyes, flashing eyes,
brilliant eyes, soulful eyes are not. in it
with the eyes of the direct gaze, particu
larly if they are shaded by lids which are
rather large and heavy.
To point the nail cut it with the straight
scissors but do not have the point too
The-- nails when, too long will break, so
It Is necessary to observe some caution In
the care of them, and it Is really a task
to keep them just the right length, of the
right shape arid of the right color.
There are three or four ways of cutting
the nails. The rounded nail of the busi
ness woman is the most practical; and
the scuare nail of the working woman
is necessary in certain cases; but neither
aye as pretty) as the pointed nail of the
society .woman. But. she who weaVs the
pointed nail must taka tho time to keep
it exact.
The nails should be worn as long as pos-
Blble. They really cannot be too long.
They sh.ould>j>roject beyond the finger
tips, just so as to give them a tapering
appearance, -and the .cuticle should be
pulled low at the base to give them a
"moon." - ,
There was once a time when the woman
who went to be manicured was accused
of extravagance, and when the man who
patronized the manicure's chair was voted
a fop. But that time has gone by. Now
the woman who never manicures is hope
less, and the man who does not Indulge
In occasional visits to a manicuring es
tablishment runs the risk of being badly
groomed.
The beauty of the hand depends largely
upon the prettiness of the nails. Two
features Influence the nails. First, their
length; second, their shape. Coloring en
ters into it a little, but not much.
Pretty Nails.
Among the men the possession of good
hands is unusual, yet when found it is
delightful. King Leopold of the Belgians
has long, handsome hands and his con
quests have been attributed to them.
King Edward VII has fat. stubby fingers,
which are, however, always highly mani
cured; and Prime Minister Salisbury
boasts the finest hands in England.' But
such cases are rare among the masculine
sex, and it is to the women that the high
care of the hands is left.
Blavatski was noted for her conquests.
She had an impossible face and a heavy
figure, yet her hands were lovely to be
hold. The Frincess Chimay has remark
ably fine hands and Qleo de Merode num
bers her fingers as her charms.
And in some ways the hand takes prece
dence of the face.' An ugly hand has often
driven tack admiration; and a hand that
was not well kept has stifled the word of
praise and the sight of appreciation.
What more effective weapon has a
woman than her hand? If shapely, soft,
well turned and well cared for, It Is un
doubtedly the most powerful of all aids
to beauty, aside from the face itself. , #
With *a wave of her hand Josephine
Beauharnals brought Napoleon to her
side. She had lost her pet pug and he
rescued i{for her. He afterward said
It was the extreme fairness of that mem
ber, that supple little hand, that first
subjugated him and made him captive to
Josephine's charms. â¢
they will look colorless, listless and ex
pressionless. One ought never to let the
eyes get tired; when they do bathe them
with warm water and go to bed.
ing the hands rub the nails very lightly
over the cake of soap and. In washing,
wash out the soap from underneath. Thi3
is worth an hour of scraping and doe*
not Injure the Inner surface.
With a little care exercised In the mat
ter of cleaning the nail, the whole will
soon begin to grow pinkish toward the
tip; and that white edge will disappear.
As for the "moon" at the base of the
nail It can only be brought out by coax
ing. Usually the first attempt to force
the moon forth will result in great un
sightly white spots along the base of tha
nail, which must grow out before they
can be removed.
White spots are sears and are always
produced by an Injury to the base of the
. nail. Very often the injury is done with
the orange wood stick, again it is the
work of the cuticle knife. The nail at its
base Is very soft and, if pressed upon,
will be Injured and a white spot will re
sult. This is the secret of so many dis
figured finger nails, such as are often
found upon the fingers of the most fasti
dious women.
How to Manicure.
Manicuring Is a simple operation and
one that can be performed at home, if
preferred, or if economy Is any motive.
It should not be done oftener than
twice a week at most, as nothing Injures
the nail as much as frequent clipping and
cutting. The work of the manicure dur
ing the week Is very simple and consists
merely In loosening the flesh at the base
of the nail and in polishing the nail into
brilliancy.
When manicuring begin by soaking the
fingers in lukewarm water. It Is surpris
ing- how large a part this plays in tho
process yet how often it 13 neglected. A
certain woman who is noted for her pretty
pink tips cultivated the habit of soaking
one hand in water fifteen minutes, read-
Ing the while. She then lays aside her
book and finishes the manicuring of the
hand.
The other hand Is then treated In thÂ«
same way with the preliminary fifteen
minutes' soaking and the result Is some
thing that is worth while.
Few people realize that, in dealing withN
the nail, they are really dealing with aj
substance that Is pliable; tho nail can beJ
softened by soaking and It can then be
almost molded into the right shape, while
the color is easily changed when the Bur
face is thus softened.
After the finger tips have been soaked
fifteen minutes it Is time to clip away
the ragged bits of cuticle. Do not cut off
the cuticle in strips, as is the custom with
so many. Let It remain on. It will hard
en when the hands get dry and will really
protect the pretty mcon.
The Cuticle Knife.
Keep pushing back the skin and dip off
only such portions as appear to be ragged.
Sometimes the cuticle scissors are not
necessary and. if so. It is an Indication
that the hands are in very excellent con
dition indeed.'
Then comes the shaping of the nail. Use
your judgment as to the shape, but do
not make the mistake of clipping it close
ly at the sides. Leave the sides as high
as you can, for this high nail supports the
finger ends and keeps them from getting
thick. Yon will find: that, where the cor
ners of the nails are cut away, the finger
invariably sags, lacking the necessary
support. The taper finger tip is the ona
whose nail is not cut away at the cor

It Is a good thing if the nail can be a
third longer than it Is wide. There are
those who admire a nail twice as long as
it is wide. If the cuticle can be trained to
grow dawn and expose the moon this pro
portion is a good one. The moon should
be plainly visible, and should be of that
soft delicate color always found In a
healthy nail..
Now when the nails are shaped, comes
the time for coloring them. If you like
pink nails you can use a little nail rouge.

Those who do not want a polish can

But those who want the polish can have

and go to work, rubbing the nails briskly
with the implement. It Is a mistaken
idea to put on much powder, for it only

cuticle while It does not polish them with
any more brilliancy. Use as little as pos

the polisher seems dry.
Powder is said to make the nail3 brittle
and to heat them by friction until they
are liable to snap under the rubbing. But
with care one can Impart quite a high
polish without running these risk3.
It Is necessary, finally, to wash the
hands with soap to get off the powder.
And then comes a* chance for a very
little cold cream which should be rubbed
into the hands to keep them from chap

nail to keep it from growing fast and
making hang-nails. -^
The hang-nail, as It Is commonly called,
is the cause of a great deal of trouble to
many persons, but it can be cured by
soaking the finger tips well and by uslnf
a little vaseline at the base of the nail
after each manicuring.
Once learn the trick of a steady gaze,
and no matter how plain a girl may be
there is a sfmetbir*: about Ler which ov-
Gain this power of not moving or speak
ing and at the same time looking Inter
ested, and you will be voted a charming
girl, even by the man whose talk Is so
stupid that you never think of such a
thing as really listening to it.
If you keep your eyes up to their share
of talking you will' be spared a thousand
verbal insincerities when Mr. Bore dashes
up saying he is so glad to sea you, and
that he hopes you are glad to see him.
He will feel satisfied If you look pleased
end sympathetic, and your conscience will
be clearer than If you bad gotten off some
polite fib.
It is the advice of one who has had
much experience in such matters that if
you get into the habit of always letting
your eyes attend quietly io a
thing . fcrsst, you will avoid lots
of embarrassing situations. Suppose
you have been discussing Miss
Brown's hair, and have committed the in
discretion of calling it r"ed, when a voice
sounds close at your side, which to your
horror you think you recognize as Miss
Brown's. Why give a convulsive start,
a compromising gurgle or half-formed ex
planation or deprecation? You will be
wiser and safer, and more graceful, too,
if you just turn your eyes to see if it is
Miss Brown. If it is, your complete re
pose and control of your eyes may make
her think she didn't hear aright, in case
ehe did hear, and will not arouse her sus
picions in case she didn't hear.
You can convey thus just what you
want to say, and in a charming fashion
winch is bound to captivate him.
r "l have been hunting through the en
lire ballroom for you." Then he adds,
"And now you are not glad to see me."
It is enough .just to lift your head and
give him a look through level eyelids.
There. may be a time, however, to lower
the eyelids and droop the head; it is
when Jack says:
This is a big secret, or a trick if you
vill â never try to do too much. The girl
who makes a sort of plunge at a man.
saying, "Oh! Oh! Mr. Knickerbocker,
how glad I am to see you! Do sit down!
Oh. how are you?" with acempanying
laughs and fluttering of her eyes, does
nut make half the impression accom
plished by the girl whose eyes light uptill
ber ;ips catch the smite of welcome, and
whose hand goes out before she says just
â¢'Mr. Knickerbocker" in a voice that
means something, accompanied by a clear,
f.tiaightforward gaze which may "mean
something more.
Let your eyes follow the story your es
cort is tellingâ it may be awfully stupidâ
iind it will be easier to 1st your eyes and
Jtace reflect his various expressions of in
terest than to pretend further, and follow
bit, with exclamations which are bound
to seem insincere or overdone.
"Well, of course, it requires some prac
tice: the directions, however, 'are quite
simpleâ -let^hine eyes look right on, and
thine eyelids look straight before thee;'
you can easily understand that a clear,
sieady gaze has a power to charm which
a shining, circling glance never can
pessers."
"And by practicing this new way of
making one's self irresistible, I suppose one
Ioarsis to say the ten thousand things
wblcfc Adcison tells us it only occurs to
a man to say after he is in love?"
"Of course, provided you give your head
just the right poiseâ this, too. is impor
tant. There is nothing more graceful than
the bend of a woman's head on a well
poised neck. Try that bendâ this is an
other secretâ no need to move the rest .of
ycu."
It is an important lesson that the two
have- learned, that if one would success
fully tread the path of beauty, she must
remember that eyes are not given merely
to see with, but to speak with, to charm
v.-ith. that they may be trained, ard that
nothing is more fetching than the
straightforward gaze, which indicates thai
a person is in complete possession of her
eelf, confident of her own powers and
strength, and does not feei the need of
looking hither and thither for a way of
escape.
"It is this. I am told that 1 must regu
late my eyelids, or rather train them;
that if I succeed in doing so. and gaze
out upon the world through level eyelids,
that then at last I am in possession of
the very secret of secrets for making a
dazzling beauty of myself."
"How charming this all sounds." ex r
claimed the sympathetic listener, who
was now really interested. "Do tell me
ebout this new art of fascinating, that I
may get my visual organs in training at
once."

Here Angelique paused for breath, and
pillowing her flushed cheek upon her
dimpled hand, gazed reflectively and in
quiringly at her friend, who simply look
ed sympathetic and said nothing.

In 1737. The Interior, In 1816, was de

In harmony with the original plan.
Outside, under the arches of San Carlo,
sit the public writers at their desks ready '
at a moment's notice to write a love son
net or a flowery expostulation warranted
to melt the heart of a too-persistent cred
itor. â¢:'
The Royal Theater was originally
lighted by candles; later gas was Intro
duced and now it Is lighted by electricity.
The candelabra and gas jets are still there,
marking the three eras of lighting, and
mutely calling attention to the antiquity
of the house.
This picture was taken on the occasion
of the gala night given to the Emperor of
Germany on his return rrom Jerusalem.
The royal box, which Is directly opposite
fromUhc stage, contains, beginning at tho
right: The deceaased King Humbert L of
Italy, the Queen of Italy, the Empress of
Germany,' the Emperor of Germany and
King .Victor Emmanuel III, present ruler
of Italy. In the boxes at the right .and
left of the stage. are the cabinet and
princes of Italy.
The Theater San Carlo la connected
with the royal palaceV and royalty walks
into its box from the palace.
The other boxes are owned by. the no
bility. "They have been handed down from
generation to generation. In the ; flrst
place these noble families came forward
and helped to furnish money to build thjs
temple dedicated to the art of . music and
the boxes will be a heritage to them and
their heirs forever.
' This is all right for the nobility, but
makes^lt a little hard on the manager,
lie gets no rent for the boxes except the
entrance fee, which varies from 2 t;o 5
francs, or from 40 cents to $1 in our money.
Ten francs or $2 is the; price in the top '
gallery, where the students usually sit,
and 30 francs or $6 in the pit, or paltrona;
as they call it. ! . ['Â¦ Â¦ \, .
But the manager,., or impresario, is a
man who has barrels of money to pay out.
He is manager for art's sake and not for
commercial reasons. ' He Has no rent to
pay, for the theaters there are a munici
pal institution. But there is the ballet of
600 to iooo. -v ;,..-â¢ .
, In one opera . I attended at . lÂ»a . Scala
(Milano) there were ten changes of cos
tumes, making 10,000 costumes, and all
beauties, too, for there is nothing cheap
or tawdry at. the Royal Theater. It keeps
open only' during the winter season, and
the manager is "satisfied if he does not
lose more than $50,000. Ho is a patron of
art, and art- is a shrine at which the
Italians worship, just as we worship at
the shrine of dollars and cents. .
And, after all, it must be an investment
on which he looks back with pleasure.
Think of feeding 3600 hungry souls with
music!
The staging is realistic. The stage is
350 feet deep and 200 feet wide, and a vil
lage scene, for instance, instead of being
painted on the back drop, as would "be
done in ah ordinary theater, is built up
of ' set houses, smoke ascends from the
chimneys, neighbors gossip on the door
steps, or an Alpine boy drives a* herd of
real sheep along the village street in the
rear of the stage while, the singing is go
ing on before the footlights. No expense
is spared.
The rehearsals are something thorough,
as I had occasion to notice when on the
anniversary of -Verdi's death they pro
duced "II Trovatore." Although the cast
had sung the j opera over three hundred
times" Musical Director Toscaninl re
hearsed It thirty-two times for this occa
sion. . - t ;
Italy is the land, of opera. Here they
make a specialty of the ballet. There is
nothing like it in the world. It makes
other performances . look like amateurs'. Â»
Manzotti, the great ballet wrlter,#goes up
to the Royal Theater and rehearses them,
and here many of the celebrated composi
tions of Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti
were performed for the first time.
The atmosphere of music hallows the
place and forces itself on the attention
of even the most casual globe-trotter.
And right here I want to make a plea
for San Francisco. It Is beyond doubt
the most musical city in America. Here
people love music, and they go to the
opera for the love of music. In the East
ern cities they go to meet their friends
and to gossip. But the atmosphere of
San Francisco, musically, is similar to
that of Italy, and that is saying a good
deal for a commercial city, for Italy has
the advantageâ even the llttlo towns of
Italy have their band conceits every aft
ernoon in the public squares, and that
familiarizes the people with c.assical mu
sic. They are as familiar with the groat
musters there as San Franciscans are
with "Goo-goo Eyes." But then they
have the heritage of generations of music
lovers, accentuated by two or three hours
per day of the best cosmopolitan musicâ
for the Wagnerian and French ure. aa
much a part of their repertoire as Ital
ian.
I come back from Italy with the ideu of
starting San Franciscans to think of a
municipal band .of fifty or sixty pieces.

sion when Secretary of State John Hay
rose to deliver his memorial address to
the memory of William McKinley. At the
Capitol, the officers of the Government,
both houses of Congress and the nation's
guest. Prince Henry of Prussia, had as
sembled to pay the national tribute of re

hour demanded a fitting message, and the
orator of the day proved equal to the de
mand. In an. earnest, dignified address,
full of lofty eloquence, Mr. Hay paid a
tribute that will live as long as the name
of McKinleyâ and even lend to that hon

when personal memory is passed away.

"At Sunwich Port" Is a long series of
sketches tied together with a slight
thread of love 6tory. The primary motif
of the book is the feud between
two ceafaring men. Captain Nugent
loses his ship to his second officer
through an unfortunate accident in the
fog. when the captain, at the Court of
Inquiry, Is blamed and the first officer.
Hardy, is made captain. Nugent gets
another ship a little later, but he never
forgives Captain Hardy for having sup
planted him in his old position.
At the beginning of the story Kate Nu
gent and Jack Nugent are mere children,
but they take up the feud of the captain
against the Hardy boy and there aro
Kome very lively times at Sunwich Port.
The Hardy boy invariably comes out vic
torious, both as a strategist and as a
fighter of pitched battles, and succeeds
in making- matters most active for aft the
Nugent lamiiy â even including the cap
tain and his faithful steward, Wilks,
who left the ship with his master.
Finally young Hardy is sent by his
father to London to study and Jack Nu
gent, after making a failure in his efforts
to draw a salary without work in the
local bank, is shipped away as an. ap
prentice, but tinaliy deserts ship ana noth
ing more is heard of him until he shows
up in Sunwich Port years after with
I>lenty of experience but no* money.
In the meantime Kate has grown up to
be a line young woman and when young
Hardy returns to Sunwich Port to go into
partnership -with Mr. Adolphus Swann in
the ebist broking business, the youth im
mediately falls in love with the fair one,
who, as a little girl, used to pull his hair.
HarJy paw is still on the high seas as
captain of The Conqueror, but Captain
Kutrent has abandoned his active life to
settle down 'to one of domestic tranquil
lity on a small inheritance â to the dismay
of his sister and his daughter. The two
old ciUJtains are still as bitter as of old
and Miss Nugent also scorns the efforts
of Jem Hardy toward changing the
hatred of the past to a friendship for the
future.
Young Nugent received such a frosty
greeting from, his parent upon his arrival
in the town that he has made no further
rffort io re-establish himself in his old
home, but has taken up his abode with
Kybird. tho sailer of second-hand clothes
for Sunwich Port, and goes to work as a
comnton laborer on the quay. All of
which in no way adds to the irate cap
tain's good humor.
Kybird knows of some property that
Jack Nugent is to Inherit, hence* his gen-.
eroslty in taking an interest in the young
man's welfare. The family of Kybird
Jinjilly agree that Jack would be a fine
catch for the fair Amelia Kybird; in
spit'? of the fact that she is already en
gaged to sir. Edward Silk, clerk, in the
firm of Swann & Hardy. With this idea
in mind thoy bide their time for an
auspicious moment when Amelia may be
able to hook the unsuspecting Nugent.
The opportunity comes one night when
Jack, returning from a convivial evening
with Jem Hardy, rushes headlong into
trouble with a speed only possible to a
yoiTiig man so carefree as himself:
He turned the handle of the door and. walk
leg in, discovered Miss Kybird entertaining
company in the person of Sir. Edward Silk.
"Kalloa," he said airily, as he took a seat.
"Don't mind me, young people. Go on Just
as you would if I were not here."
Mr. Edward Filk grumbled something under
his breath; Miss Kybird, turning to the in
truder with a smile of welcome, remarked
that she had Just thought of going to sleep.
"Going to sleep?" repeated Mr. Silk, thun
derstruck.
"Ye'a." Baid MisÂ« Kybird. yawning-.
â¢ Mr. Ellk gazed at her, open-mouthed. "What,
with me 'ere?" he inquired. In trembling tones.
"Vou're not very lively company," said Miss
KybSrd. bending over her sewing-. "I don't
think you've epoken a word for the last quar
ter of an hour, and before that you were talk-
Ing of death warnings. Mad'e my flesh creep,
you did."
"Shame!" said Mr. Nugent.
"You didn't say anything to me about your
fleeh creeping," muttered Mr. Eilk.
"You ought to have seen it creep," interposed
Mr. Nugent, severely.
"I'm not talking to you," said Mr. Silk, turn-
Ing on him: "when I want the favor of remarks
from you I'll let you know." v
"Don't talk to ,my gentlemen friends like
that, Teddy." few Miss Kybird. sharply, "be
cause I won't have It. Why don't you try and
be bright and cheerful like Mr. Nugent ?'
Mr. .Silk turned and regarded that gentleman
steadfastly; Mr. Nugent meeting his gaze with
a pleasant Emlle and a low-voiced offer to give
him lessons at half a crown an hour.
"I wouldn't be like 'Im for worlds," Bald
Mr. Bilk, with a scornful laugh. "I'd sooner
be like anybody."
"What have you bÂ»en easing to him?" in
quired Nugent.
"Nothing." replied Miss Kybird; "he's often
like that. He's got a nasty, miserable, jealous
disposition.. Not that I mind what he thinks."
Mr. Silk breathed hard and looked from one
to the otaer.
"Perhaps he'll grow out of It," said Nugent,
hopefully. "Cheer up, Teddy. You're young
yet."
"Might I arEfc," said "the solemnly enraged
Mr. Silk, "might I arsk you not to be so free
with my Christian name?"
"He doesn't like his name now," said
Nugent, drawing his chair closer to Miss Ky
bird' e. "and I con't wonder at It What shall
we call him? Job? What's that work you're
doing? Why don't you get on with that fancy
waistcoat you are doing for me?"
Before Miss Kybird could deny all knowledge
of the article in question her sorely tried ewaln
creeled a diversion by arising. To that simple
eot he imparted an emphasis which command
o<i the attention of both beholders, and draw
ing over to Miss Kybird he stood over her in
sn attitude at once terrifying and reproachful.
"Take your choice, Amelia," he said in a
thrilling voice "Me or 'imâ which is it to
be?"
"Here, steady, eld man," cried the startled
Nup^nt. "Oo easy.",
"Me or Mm?" repeated Mr. Silk, In stern but
broken accents.
Miss Kybird p'.pjrled, and avoiding- his gaze,
lr>r.VÂ«vi nrnrively at the f,-><5<*l hearthrug.
"You're making her blush." said Mr. Nugent
Fternly. "S!t down, Teddy. .I'm achamed of
you. We're both ashamed of you. You're con
fuFinc us dreadfully proposing to us both in
thf* wpy."
Mr. Silk regarded him with a scornful eye,

I Jacobs' latest book, "At Sunwich
| Port," just published/ by Charles
| Scribner's Sons, New York. Those
JL who have read "Many Cargoes" or
some others of Mr. Jacobs' humorous
bits will understand the treat that they
have before them. "At Sunwich Port" is
a man's book, but still it is so good In
its way that it cannot fail to please some
members of the fair sex as well.
Mr. Jacobs now stands well near tha
top as one of the humorists of the day.
He makes his point by suggestion rather
than description; a method both effective
and fascinating. For example, witness
thÂ§ following paragraph telling of the
sensations of young Jack Nugent when
his sea-captain father, after observing
his son's failure as a bank clerk, places
the youth as apprentice on the bark
According to the original plan the cap
tain writes his son to meet him at the
house of Wilks. Jack goes, under the im
pression that here is an opportunity for
a reconciliation. According to the orig
inal plan the son is to drink some drug
ged wine and in the morning is to find
himself aboard the whaler and well out
at sea. According- to actual occurrence
and the reserve fund of Nathan Smith,
both father and son are drugked, and in
the morning Jack awakes in the bedroom
of the old steward with a splitting head
ache, while Captain Nugent comes to
himself in the forecastle of . Captain
Hardy's ship, which happened to be just
ready to san at that time.
The scene that ensues when Captain
Nugent, stowaway, meets Captain Hardy,
master, on the bridge o*"The Con
queror" may well be imagined. ,,-._
It is at this stage of the story that
young Hardy and Mr. Swann come to the
rescue with a scheme all of their own.
Nathan Smith also has a hand in this,
but clever as he is he finds more than a
match in the dapper senior partner of
the firm of Swann and Hardy. The firm
saves Jack from, becoming- a mem
ber of the Kybird family, and
incidentally wins the toleration of
the old captain, who has finally
succeeded io getting out of the fore
castle of 'T'he Conqueror" and back
again to his home; but it is only after
some very anxious moments and clever
plotting.
The blustering old captain really has
the right sort of a heart back of his bluff
ways, and it is easy to see that the story
will end happily for all, but that fact
by no means lessens the interest of the
book. Mr. Jacobs shows himself a mas
ter in the art of character drawing. You
feel, by the time you have finished Sun
wich Port, that if the place really ex
isted you might go to the town, knowing
its inhabitants as intimately as if you
had lived among them for years. If you
wish good, wholesome entertainment
with a laugh for every minute, as the
comedy sign-bills read, you cannot af
ford to miss meeting these people that
Mr. Jacobs has created for our amuse
ment.
Nathan Smith, the boarding-house
keeper, is just the man to carry the af
fair oft with flying colors except for one
small point which Captain Nugent had
overlooked; he is old Kybird's best friend
and Amelia's godfather. His nature is
such, however, that he by no means re
fuses to help the captain in his distress,
but simply goes into the plan with an
other littie idea held up his own sleeve
as a reserve fund. He proposes to get
lhe captain's money for himself and do
the Kybird family a good turn at the
same time.
When Captain Nugent learns that his
son is to marry into the odious Kybird
family he is beside himself with wrath
and in order to save the family honor
from absolute perdition invents a won
drous plan. He cÂ«dls to his assistance
his trusty steward, Wilks, who lives in a
modest way in a home of his own in
Fullalove Alley at Sunwich. The schem
ers arrange with a sailor boarding-house
keeper to find a berth for Jack on an out
going whaler; the idea being that a trip
in the Arctic for a year will probably
take all thoughts of the fair Amelia out
of young Nugent's head besides beating
a little common sense therein at the
same time. â¢ â* 'V
"This," 6aid' Mr. Nugent, as he sat on his
bed that night to take his boots off; "this is
what comes of trying to make everybody happy
and comfortable with a little fun. I wonder
Â¦what the governor"!! eay?"
Mrs. Kybird, after a moment's reflection, ad
mitted that he was right, and, the chain of
memory being touched, waxed discursive about
her own wedding and the somewhat exciting
details which had accompanied it. AXter which
she produced a bottle labeled "Port wine"
from the cupboard, filling- four glasses,
celebrated the occasion in a befitting but sober
fashion.
"He did," e&id Mr. Kybird, grimly; "and
I pretty near broke 'is 'ead for it. 'Arry Smith
is the one you're thinking of."
The stout lady in the chair gazed at the
couple fondly. "It reminds me of our wed
ding," she said, softly. "What was' it Tom
Fletcher said, father? Can you remember?"
" 'Arry Smith, you mean," corrected Mr.
Kybird.
"Tom Fletcher said something, . I'm sure,"
persisted his wife.
"Bar none," said Mr. Kybird, emphatically.
"I wasn't," said Mr. Nugent, truthfully. The
situation had developed so rapidly that it had
caught him at a disadvantage. He had a dim
feeling that, having been the cause of Miss
Kyblrd's losing one young man, the most ele
mentary notions of chivalry demanded that he
should .furnish her with another. And this
idea was clearly uppermost in the minds of her
parents. He looked over at Amelia, and with
characteristic philosophy accepted the posi
tion. /
"We shall be the Handsomest couple in Sun
wich." he said, simply.
"It's a bit rough on Teddy, isn't it?" in
quired Mr. Nugent, anxiously; "besides "
"Don't you worry about "im," said Mr. Ky
bird, affectionately. "He ain't worth it."
"So 'ave I," said Mr. Kybird. He shook
hands warmly with Mr. Nugent, and, patting
that perturbed man on the back, surveyed him
with eyes glistening with approval.
"Never mind 'im." said his wife, who was
Bitting- in the easy chair distributing affection
ate smiles between her daughter and the
startled Mr. Nugent. "Make 'er happy. Jack;
that's all I arsk. She's been a good gal, and
she'll make a good wife. â¢ I've seen how it
was between you for some time." ',

Vegetarian Cook Book.
"A Comprehensive Guide Brfok to Nat
ural. Hygienic and Humane Diet." by Sid
ney H. Beard, is a vegetarian cook book,
published at an opportune time. The ad
vancing prices of meat, together with the
natural desire for cooling and easily pre
pared foods during the summer time, will
probably result in Its widespread popu
larity. It is^not so much an argument
for that food system as a practical plan
for its observance, devoting most of its
space to recipes and suggestions. Slmplo
directions for salads, luncheon dishes,
desserts and other toothsome dishes make
the book of value to every housekeeper,
Irrespective of her "food creed."
But the subject itself of food reform is
beginning to be seriously considered by
thoughtful and enlightened persons in all
parts of the world, and the extent of this
Interest is increasing day by day. Th*
fact that- the nature, quality and quantity
of our dally food largely detcrmln* our

Deep Sea Plunderings.
Frank T. Bullen, author of "The Cruise
of the Cachalot" and other successful sea
stories, has just brought out another vol
ume of salt water yarns, called "Deep I
Sea Plunderings." In this he emphasizes
not only the freshness and vieor of the
sea, but also its. grandeur and gloom, its
I uncertainty and remorselessness. )
Mr. Bullen Is a past master of deep-,
water literature. He introduces the pic
turesque and dramatic side of a sailor's
life as well as depicting the hardships of
fo"c'stle existence. "Deep Sea Plunder
ings" is ;a series of bewildering sea
stories. ;The thrilling experiences that the
unknown sailor faces as -a mere incident
of his . daily life, and the hardships, hi
encounters, are pictured with the vivid
ness and insight that the author of "The
Cruise of j the Cachalot" always realizes
so forcibly and inevitably in his brilliant
pages. (Published by D. Appleton it Co.,

Tolstoi, always a world-force. Is here
seen again. in one of his most character
istic attitudesâ stern adherence to what
he thinks is right, fearless denunciation
of wrong, and able exposition of the^en-
liof s,' which question many of the funda
mental truths of the Bible, one does not
see how his church could avoid . refusing
him the sacrament, for he follows Vol
taire at more than one point, while yet
adhering to the "true - religion, that is.
a true relation to the source of allâ God."
Of scarcely less import; though a much
shorter article is the succeeding paper
"On Religious . Tolerance." Here he
sounds the note -of the prophet â and the
iconoclast. Then cornea score of essays
and -letters, not one of -which is without
It3 interest. Nearly all of them are of
theological trend. We- cannot give the
bent of his mind better'than by quoting
once more from the author, where he
takes issue with Coleridge and says: "I
began by loving my orthodox faith more
than my peace; then I loved Christianity
more than my church; and now I love
the truth more than anything in . the
world. And until now the truth coincides
for me with Christianity as I understand
it; and I profess this Christianity, and
in that measure in^ which I do profess
it I peacefully arid joyously 'live and
peacefully and joyously am approaching
death." â¢ '

A literary friend one* told Julia Mar
lowe that if she could write with th^
same spirit and descriptive power that
characterize her conversation she would
be able to make a book that would prove
Intensely readable. Whether Miss Mar
lowe \took the compliment to her conver
sational powers very seriously or not, she
at least treasured up the remark a3 to
how one might make a spirited book, and
is putting it in practice in preparing her
forthcoming volume, "Six Girls From
Shakespeare. " It will be her first book,
and naturally she is eager that it will do
her tome credit. She has been studying
the subject, which relates to the historic,
literary and artistic traditions which lin
rer around the six Shakespearean hero
ines that she has playedâ namely, Juliet.
Viola, Imogen, Beatrice. Rosalind and
Mariaâ for a long time and has the mate
rial at her fingers' ends. It is in the
shaping up of it that she is now engaged,
.and the book, far from being written. Is
being dictated. On three mornings of the
week a stenographer comes to her apart
ment and takes her dictation while she
speak3 from rough notes for two or three
hours. "When he leaves he has from two
to three thousand words in his note book,
which he brings back the following morn

previous day's dictation and corrects, in

though they had been walked over by a

stenographer departs with tho amended

the action of the drop.
Still another test of this nature is to
-pass the stone over .a piece of aluminum.
Both the metal and the stone should ba
absolutely free from any trace of grease.
The metal will give off some of Its color
to an imitation stone; while a genuine
diamond will remain perfectly clear and
unaffected. Among jewelers the final test
is to apply a drop of fluorhydric acid totha
stone under suspicion. The acid will eat
info any false diamond and frost It, whila
the genuine stone will not be damaged In
the slightest degree.
Perhaps the simplest method ot all,
however, is to examine an ink spot on a
sheet of white paper through a diamond,
by holding the upper surface against tha
eye. If the stone be counterfeit, the black
spot will appear greatly multiplied, or at
least doubled. The outline will, moreover,
appear blurred and Indistinct. By using a
magnifying glass the test can readily bÂ«
made absolute.
The optical test*is the best in examin
ing rubies and emeralds. It Is commonly
supposed that such stones can be best
tested by rubbing them with a file, that
the genuine stones resist the steel, whila
the imitation only will suffer; but tha
test is not exhaustive. The best plan la
to examine them closely with a mlcro-
Bcope of about 100 diameters. The gen
uine stones have a number of mlnuto
flaws, whereas the imitations are likely
to be much more nearly perfect In tex
ture.
The imitation ruby Is filled with mlnuta
air bubbles, which are not to bo found in
the genuine stones. The color of tho imi
tation is sometimes even purer and more
even than the real stones. As a rule, any
yellowish tinge is considered suspicious.

57vP NY one. can tell a genuine diamond
// \\ or precious stone even from a very
Ii x> clever imitation. There are a few
household tests which are practi
cally infallible. The diamond expert,
after long years of experience with gems,
can detect an imitation, as a rule, at a
glance. The layman in Â«ucn matters, with
a few. simple .' tests, tanes more time to
solve such,probjems. but his judgment in
the end is scarcely less accurate.
An imitation djamond is never so bril
liant as a genufne stone. If your eye is
not experienced enough to detect the dif
ference, a very simple test is to place the
stone under water. The imitation stone is
practically extinguished, while -a genuine
diamond sparkles even under water and
is distinctly visible. When possible, place
a genuine stone beside the possible Imita
tion under water and the contrast will
be apparent to the least experienced eye.
The glass cutting test is, of course,
more or less familiar. It Is probably the
most common.
False diamonds are usually cut "more
regularly than the genuine stones. In
cutting a diamond the material is saved
as far as possible. In an imitation the
material is itself worthless and no at
tempt is made to suit the size or angle
of the facets to the form of the stone. It
can be put down as a safe rule that when
a stone is cut with great evenness and
regularity it is, to say the least, a very
suspicious sign.
Another very simple and effective test
is to place a drop of water on the stone
and carefully 'observe the result. The
stone should first be very carefully clean
ed. On an imitation diamond the drop,
however small, will deliquesce. The drop
will, however, retain its original shape on
a true stone. To make the test quite sure,

In describing how the Marquis of

cannot do better than quote the record
niade of the event by Queen Victoria in

"This w-as ati eventful day. Our dear
Louise became engaged to Lord Lome.
The event took place during a walk from
the Glassalt Shiel to Loch Dhu. We got
home by 7. Louise, who returned some
time after, told me that Lome had spoken
of his devotion to her and proposed to
her, that she had accepted him, knowing
that I should approve."
It was in the same palace, i. e., Rosen
berg, the seat of the Danish royal family,
where Britain's King proposed to the
"Daughter of the Sea Kings," that the
present Czar asked Princess Alix
of Hesse in 1S94 to be . his wife.
He had made up his mind long
before that if he married it would be
to whom he pleased rather than one cora
n:onded to him by his counselors for state
reasons. His choice fell upon Princess
Alix, and a party was arranged at.Rosen
berg to allow Nicholas to meet this royal
lady. Accounts differ regarding the actual
spot where the proposal took place. Some
say the Czar proposed during an evening
party; others that he did so in the gar
dens round the palace while out for a
walk with the Princess. The latter ac

SOME big prices lately paid for dogs
havÂ» again raised ths quaation as j
to the highest figures ever realized
In tha various breeds. This refers
to bona-flde prices and not to the fables
often circulated for th* amazement of tha
'snorant.
Last week 11000 In cash was offered
and refused at the Illinois field trials
for the pointer king, Cyrano. A few
weeks before Charles Tway, the ownsr of
the young setter,"' Count Oakley, refused
$350 for that fine Bon of Oakley Hill. John
Consldine of Washington State, the well
knewn sporting man, gave Dr. Yancey of
SedaTIa $700 for the setter Doc Hick. A
few years ago the setter Howdy Rod sold
for $2500. About twenty years ago Pierre
Lorillard Jr. gave $1500 for Dashing
Monarch and $1000 for Salvalette, the dam
of Paul Gladstone.
More dogs bring high prices now than
ten-or fifteen years ago, but the highest
marks of the older period have not been
duplicated lately. Probably the largest
actual price ever paid for any dog in
this country . was the $4000 which W.
C. Reick of the New Yorlr Herald gave
for Sir Bedevere, the St. Bernard. That
transaction was often Stated at $6000 and
$7000, but the real cash amount was
$4000. Pierpont Mc/gan . has paid some
good sum for crliles, but noooay cmxx^I
himself, his keunel manager and the ven
dors know just what money changed
hands. It Is doubtful, however, whether
he ever gave much over $1000 for any
specimen. The California greyhound. For
Freedom, probably could have been sold
for 54000 or $5000, but he never changed
hands after coming to this country. In
England he was not greatly distinguished
and cost only a moderate sum when Im
ported.
To bring a high price nowadays a dog
must usually have an ultra fashionable

It seems to you, being a boy, that the
girl always knows Just what to do and .s
entirely at ease when you are struggling
sc miserably with the forms and usages
of the nollte world. But as a matter of
fact she has her troubles, too. She has
to be taught to slip her hand gracefully
through your erm. It Is no* easy for her
to do this at first. The dancing teacher
has to give her all sorts of private tips
on the matter. She ha* a tendency to
clutch your sleeve at first, as If it were
gcir.g to *et away. She Is told that her
hand must Ho perfectly at rest, that you
are not going to break away and run.

don't know what on earth to do with it,

they expected to lose It, or perhaps they
held it out at long range as if it was. a
thing that you mustn't touch.

when the youngsters are in their Satur
oay best than it would be if they had on
checked ginghams ard percale shirt
vaistE. The psychological value of
clothes- is too deep for you and me. but
just the same we both know that good
clothes make good children. So when
the little folks are dressed up, as they
always are for the dancing class, they
are well started along the right road.
At any rate, whether ballroom graces
b<- natural or not. they are all the more
charming for being cultivated. So our
Saturday afternoon dancing classes are
full to overflowing, and the airs and
graces of some of the belles of five might
give pointers to many a damsel of four
times as? many years. And the boys, too
âthey forget, as soon as they find them
selves in their dancing pumps, shiny and
tlippery and smart â they forget that girls
v.-<re ever made to be teased, to have
their braids pulled, to be frightened with
rubber spiders. The pumps lend a new
dignity. The small boy of America turns
chivalrous on the spot. He has left his
toy spider -behind in his other coat pocket
end he doesn't even miss it. These Satur
day afternoon little girls are so different
from the ones that he goes to school
with on week days. They don't have
braids to pull on Saturday. The braids are
all let out loose, in little flutes and
Tvrinkles. The flutes and wrinkles are tied
with tremendous silken bows. The little
girls' clothes stand out, fluffy and volum
inous on Saturday afternoon and the lit
tle girls have a reverential way of treat
ing their clothes, a way which says as
plainly as words, "We don't stand for
sny mussing." There is something so
very different about themâ they do not
seem to be the same old schoolmates at
allâ that the small boy in the shiny
pumps approaches with something like
timidity and asks humbly for the honor
of a dance.
And the dances! They are the very
same that the big sisters know and con
sider quite good enough for their twenty
yea r-old dignity.
But the actual dancing is not half as
important, so all the parents agree, as
are the manners of the ballroom. So

It is far easier to teach these things
THE smart set of ten years from
now is already in training. Bellas
and gallants of the next' decade are
to-day learning the wiles and gal
lantries that will keep Cupid's
archery in practice ten or fifteen years
hence. The ball room of the future is be
ing prepared now, for the youngsters are
hard at it, learning its etiquette. They
take to it like ducks to water, by the
way. Perhaps there is not so much in the
training, after all.

toe are gtrma physical training exercises
to develop grace. Bome of these look
very ridiculous In the beginning, but they
are helping you all th* time to be more
graceful, more at peace with your arms
'and legs. In a row of boys you are taught
how to bend the knees, to bend the feet,
to make the whole body supple. The lit
tle girls 'are put In a row and given bend-
Ing exercises all for the same purpose.
Some day yon will all realize how much
this has to do with your ease of manner,
your stylish carriage, your self-poise.
Little, fancy dances are taught, all for
the, development of grace. More than
this, they are performed In solo, and that
helps the performers to bear public gaze
easily.
There Is not a dance of to-day's ball
room which Is too difficult to be given to
the little folks, with their quick Imita
tion. The Saturday afternoon classes
show waltzes, all kinds or waltzes, two
steps, minuets, square dances.
They look such Impossibilities to you
when you begin. You can't realize what
a few weeks will accomplish. You won't
believe to-day that a little while will find
you a polished gallant, fit for any ball
room.

As Lord Kitchener's star has ascended,
so has Lord Roberts' declined. The gen
ial optimism of the old fighter who is
now commander-in-chlef grates so bitter
ly upon a people severely overtaxed for
the war which Lord Roberts so long ago
declared finished, that the spontaneous
popularity which made him the hero of
the jubilee procession could never be re
peated at the coronation. Indeed, it Is
more likely to be transformed into a hos
tile demonstration, in which General Bul
ler's name may be greeted with cheers.
One of the most curious features of the
v.ar is the remarkable way in which Lord
Kitchener has deepened the awesome re
spect, akin to fear, with which the Erit
jsn cation regards him and his. laconic re
ports, and his utterly independent prose
cution of the campaign in South Africa
has heightened his military reputation to
such an extent that he has actually be
come a god to the average man-in-the
street. Yet he is universally admitted to
have next to nothing in common with his
countrymen or their government.
Already the wiseacres are saying that
l^ord Kitchener will be made an Earl and
receive the thanks of Parliament, accom
pajiied by a substantial grant of money.

DIES AT PRAYER.
Peering through a little archway in the
shrine, and facing the wayfarer on the
roadway stood the small marble image of
the Holy Mother and child. Pelee's blast
had left of the heavy timber forming the
stemof the cross only a blackened stump.
Its top. . no trace of . which . remained, load
probably been< hurled far away into the
sea below. .'But the little shrine "stood
unscathed. The white image of the Vir
gin bore not a trace of f\re, though both
it and the -little sanctuary in which -it
stood . are . heavily coated with the \ thick
gray, dust that; paints all things here the
same somber hue.
From the side. of a .roadway a 'circling
flight of stone steps Iead3 upward on the
mountain slope to a little plateau about'
twenty feet above. There had been erect
ed one of those little shrines to the Virgin
which are -so common in countries peo
pled by the Latin^ races. The miniature
chapel was crudely built of stone and
brlck'To a height. of not more, than ten
feet above its base and directly behind it
two massive timbers, towering away
above,: had been wrought into the form
of a^crosa.'
WRECK OF A SHRINE.
No better evidence is found of the tor
nado-like force of ih^j blast than is seen
along this roadway. It is littered at every
step with remnants of the tin roofs torn
from the houses of St. Pierre, a mile or
more away, and all rent and twisted into
fantastic shapes. As the 'road is built
along the slope of the mountain and is
retained by a stone parapet there is a
sheer piecu".ous fall on Us one side while
the mountain rises abruptly above.lt on
the other. -The same blast that wrecked
the city denuded the mountain side of
.every traJce" of shrubbery, uprooted the
most magnificent- of its great tropical
trees and sent /them hurlins down the
slope. Many of the stumps and remnants
of these trees were checked in their fall
by the roadway, and in -places, mingled
as- they arc with debris blown from . the
houses, they form a serious impediment.'.
TORNADO-LIKE FORCE.
. Professor Jagger of Harvard has Â¦de
scribed the Mont Pelee eruption as "being
a blast of fire driven upon and across
St. Pierre by a hurricane of wind, as
though it were a\ gigantic blowpipe, such
as chemists and lapidaries use in directing
'a powerful heat flame upon object* which
they are examining, analyzing or fusing.
.; SO forbidding was the aspect of the vol
cano' that- a score'of negro 'laborers, who
had been towed ddw'n\ frwn" 'Fort V de
France by iÂ£ steam dredge and had Hojled
during^the' early, hours of .tlie^ jinornlhg.,at^

above '<them and [ beat'f a ; hafety ; retreat to
their boats,. had started. back to Fort de
France.- This'time a landing was effectr
'ed at the extreme northern end of the ru
ined city.' At that point a;s^one causeway
spans a 'small stream, and' supported, by
terraced masonry, runs upward along the
flank of the hill on which stands the mon
ument erected to the memory of the sail
ors who died .in f the great hurricane Â¦'.. of
1892. This : oad not only s affords easy ac
cess to the the city, but at one
point i s lof ... elevation, rising as it does
to a height . of about, 200 feet above the
sea, gives an unequaled birdseye view of
the area of destruction.'
BEAT HASTY RETREAT.
; : . . -Pierre to-day*' Mont Pelee was
more violently active than on the occasion
of the vessel's previous visit' of the Sun
day before. In the. interim had occurred
the second terrific blast from the cone,
which the' scientists now here describe
as more violent than the first. That it
had not caused equal, or greater, destruc
tion, was due solely. to the fact that
nothing remained alive within the sphere
of Its-violence. â¢ From the new crater
smoke was boiling upward to-day in
fleecy masses to a height as great as that
of the cone Itself. From six to eight other
points \ along the slope, two of them al
most at the water's edge, similar masses
of smoke and steam indicated where new
! vents or crevasses were giving outlet to
the seething subterranean mass. One of
the most menacing of these appeared to
be located directly on the site of the well
known sulphur springs of Mont Pelee,
which for. years has been one of the
sights of the place and one of the picnic
resorts of the gay residents of the city.

WAVE FROM GREAT BLOW-PIPE
' CHICAGO. May 31â James A. Patten,
Mayor of Evanston. and a \ prominent
Board of Trade operator, to-day brought
to "'a' successful close the corner- la May
oats which has dominated tho oats mar
ket since early last fall. The profits cred
ited to Patten on the- deal are estimated
at $1,000,000.
About the time prices in corn began to
mount, skyward last year on account of
the crop shortage it was learned that
some one was taxing in all the May oats,
offered on the Chicago market ana else
where. Prices began to advance steadily,
and arourtd 37 cents it was knqwn that
i Patten was trying: to work a corner. . .
On the big flurry on the Chicago board
last December May oats were pushed to
47% cents. Since that time reactions oc
curred, and when delivery day came this
month many speculators thought the bot
tom had fallen out of the corner. It was
said Patten had 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 bush
els of the May options. Everything that
was offered to him in deliveries he took
and in turn sold practically, all the con
tract stocks to shippers at good induce
ments. This left nothing for the shorts to
acquire with which to settle, and prices
accordingly were pushed up by Patten
personally in the pit .to-day.
May oats closed yesterday at 43Ts cents.
To-day prices were Jumped about 6 cents
and closed at 49^ cents. There was a little
flurry of excitement at the close, but the
corner did not affect the other options.
Spooner occupied nearly five hours of
to-day's .session in concluding his speech
begun Thursday. His oloquente and ear
nestness attracted the attention of all
Senators and of hundreds of occupants, of
the crowded galleries. He maintained
that the United States could not leave the
Philippines "like a coward" and abandon
people who had come under our protec
tion, thus surrendering them to tyrrany
and chaos. He. did not believe in the ad

came involved in a spirited colloquy with
Hoar of Massachusetts, during which
Hoar read a statute of the State of Mas

age of J2 years. Hoar declared that it
was a cruel and barbarous law and
Spooner himself did not attempt to justi
fy it. simply citing it as an instance of
cruelty in the- righting of savage natives.
Pettus of Alabama discussed some of
the legal phases of the Philippines ques
tion and McLaurin- of Mississippi insisted
that the Democrats in the Senate had not

was fatally burned in .Blsbee to-day by the
accidental overturning of a slag car at the
Copper Queen converter.
I confidently believe that George E. Chamber
lain will be elected Governor by Hot less than
5000 majority, and from the indications it may
be more. It looks like a landslide. The re
maider of the State ticket will run well, the
majorities for which, owing to the fact that
so much interest is taken in the head of the
ticket, are hard to estimate with accuracy. W.
F. Butcher will be elected to Congress from
the Second District beyond question. Returns
on hand from the First Congressional District
are not such that I can form anything like a
correct estimate.
I am absolutely sure of the election of W.
J. Furnish for Governor. The majority on the
State ticket will be in the neighborhood of 12.
000. though that for Governor will be consid
erably less. Congressman Thomas H. Tongue,
in the First District, will be elected by an in
creased majority over two years ago, and J.
N. Williamson, in the Second District, will have
a very large majority. The Legislature will
be Republican by a safe working majority.
Chairman Samuel "White of the Demo
cratic State Committee, said:
The Democrats have -confined their
campaign -almost exclusively to- State is
sues, while the Republicans have made
national expansion and the retention of
the island possessions a basis for their
campaigning. The Republicans claim
that the State ticket, with the exception
of Governor, will have a majority of 12.
000, while the Democrats do not make any
claims.on the State aside from the head
of the ticket. The Republicans claim, the
election of both Congressmen by large
majorities and a working majority in the
Legislature. The Democrats have given
out no estimates on the Legislature.
Chairman W. F. Matthews of the Re
publican State Committee to-night said:
Furnish, the Republican nominee for
Governor, who is a resident of Umatllla
County, was a Democrat until 1896, when
he left the party and supported McKinley
for President. In 1900 ho was chosen
Presidential elector on the Republican
ticket.
George Chamberlain, the Democratic
candidate for Governor, is a resident of
this city and the present District Attor
ney. He is personally popular in this
county, as well as in a large part of
"Western Oregon, where he is widely
known, and the chairman of the Demo
cratic State Committee claims his elec
tion by 5000 majority.
\ PORTLAND. May 31.â On Monday the
electors of Oregon will vote for a full
State ticket, two Congressmen and mem
bers of the Legislature, which will elect
a United States Senator to succeed Joseph
Simon. The majority for President Me-
Kinley in 1900 was 13,000, which Is close to
the normal Republican majority In the
State for several years past. On account
of a factional fight in the Republican
party in Multnomah County (the city of
Portland) a Republican stronghold; it is
conceded by the Republicans that the ma
jority in the State of W. J. Furnish for
Governor will be considerably below the
normal.
New Legislature Will Elect
a Republican to Succeed
Senator Simon.
Both Parties Are Confi
dently Claiming the
Governorship.

The business has the largest flouring

head of the company for many years was
the late Senator Ogilvie, who died in
Montreal last year. He was succeeded as
general' manager by F. W. Thompson,
formerly general Western manager in

REDDING, May 31.â Elijah M. Hobbs,
Augustus Hobbs and Mrs. Peffer, who
live on Sand Flats, east of Redding, have
fallen heir to an- estate valued at about
$75,000. They are poor people, hauling
wood and eggs to Redding for a living.
Moses Hobbs died in Santa Barbara three
months ago and left an estate consisting
of $60,000 in cash and 400 acres of land in
Santa Barbara County. He was a bache
lor, 80 vears of age and accumulated his
wealth "in ttie stock and farming business.
He was frugal and economical to such an
extreme that he was called miserly by
many, but withal he lived comfortably
and did not go without good clothing or
food.
Hobbs left no near relatives in Santa
Barbara. E. M. Hobbs, who lives on Sand
Flats, near the scene of the Keswlck
Crude Oil Company's well, read a story
in a San Francisco paper of the death of
Moses Hobbs. He at once left for Santa
Barbara to see if the dead man was not
the uncle after whom he had been named.
He has written that the .relationship has
been established and that his uncle left
no will, The only heirs at law are E. M.
Hobbs, Augustus Hobbs and Mrs. Peffer,
a sfcster of the Hobbs, and the estate will
be divided between these three.

and has damaged fruit and grain crops
materially. Ripe cherries suffered greatly
and much grain is down. Hay was dam
aged to a great extent.
WILLOWS, May 31.â Three-quarters of
an inch of rain fell to-day, which will
materially damage cut hay and standing
grain. The latter in many fields is now
lying flat on the ground.
CHICO, May 31.â Rain began falling
here at 1:30 o'clock this morning. Further
showers would do much damage to hay
and cherries.'
SAN JOSE, May 3^.â Rain set in early
this morning and continued at intervals
during the day. About .25 of an Inch fell.
The fruit crop, with the exception- of
cherries, will be benefited. Cherries that
are ripening, mostly the black variety,
will suffer some, but it is not believed the
crop is far enough. advanced for the dam
age to be great. Hay that is cut will be
injured *o some extent.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 31.â Rain fell
here early this morning. Small fruit was
considerably damaged.
DIXON, May . 31. â An unwelcome rain
began falling this morning at 9 o'clock.

as farmers are in the midst of haying.
MARYSVILLE, May 31.â Eighty-eight
hundredths of an inch of rain fell here to
day, accompanied by lightning and thun
derâsomething unusual in this locality.
Some damage to small fruits resulted, al
though crops in general were much bene
fited.
WOODLAND, May 31.â The unexpected
change in the weather has caused appre
hension among farmers and fruit grow
ers. Light snowers have prevailed all
day and there are no indications of a
clearing up. Unless clear weather comes
soon tnere is grave danger that crops,
considered the most promising for several
years, will be materially damaged. . If
showers continue another day toe Ios3 in

not blown down, will be threatened witii
rust. â¢ No serious damage has yet re

snow fell near the town on some of the

of snow is reported on a ranch near this
city. Snow ac this time of the year has
been almost unheard of here. The only
damage will result to cut hay. Fear is
expressed that a frost may set in while
the trees are wet, killing the fruit crop.

called to guard the Fair.
Jacob Kessner, manager of the estab

sters this morning. Their business agent,
however, told Kessner that he would have
to talk to the men's acent and that he
could not talk to the men.
"I do not recognize you," said Kessnsr.

fully twentv-five per cent better. The next difference is in the style of the garmentsâ ours are fashionably cut.
Another difference is in the assortment â we show a $9 ready-to-wear suit in solid blue serges and mixed tweeds
and cheviots in a great variety of patterns. Then ours are union /made and so labeled; they are manufactured in
clean, sanitary workshops. If you knew the importance of this you would value it.
Making the clothes ourselves and selling direct to you enables 'us to give better values than anv other
firm who must buy through middlemen.
Here you get a money-backed, union-made, guaranteed suit for $9. â¢ â¢

WASHINGTON. May 31.â By the direc
tion of the President Secretary Koot has
issued a general order decreasing the
etrength of our permanent military estab
lishment and changing the ratio of its
make-up as provided in the general order
issued last May, to carry out the army
reorganization law. Under the general
order of last May the total strength of
the army was fixed at 77.2S7 men. The
order issued to-day reduces this figure to
66,437â a reduction of 10,790.
In the cavalry branch of the service the
old order specified twelve troops of eighty
five men each to a regiment; the new orr
der establishes twelve troops of seventy
five men each. This will decrease the
total strength of the fifteen cavalry regi
ments from 15.S43 to 14,040.
In the artillery branch the coast con
tingent will be kept at its former strength
of 126 companies of 109 enlisted men each,
or a total of 13,734, but the field artillery
will be reduced from thirty batteries of
160 men each to twenty-eight batterie3
(twenty-five light and three mountain) of
120 men each. Provision is made in the
new order for two siege batteries, each
with a strength of 1G0 men, which in ad
dition to the light and mountain batteries
will give the artillery corps a total en
listed strength of 17,742, as against the
18,862 men provided in the former order.
The new order reduces the number of
men to an infantry company from 104
to SO, and our thirty regiments of twelve
companies each will now give a total in
fantry force of 29,850, instead of 33,520.
The strength of the engineer branch re
mains as formerly, as does also tne
strength of the 6taff departments.
It will be the plan of the War- Depart
ment hereafter to divide the army as pro
vided in the order issued to-day, into
thirds, having one-third of the entire es
tablishment In the Philippines at all
times and the remaining two-thirds in
the United States and elsewhere. By thi3
plan an enlisted man taking six years as
a basis would serve four years in the
United States proper, or in Hawaii or in
Alaska to every two years served in the
Philippines.

The Police Commissioners submitted to
the Board of Supervisors yesterday the

rate of liquor license to be paid by drug
stores at $5 -per quarter. The ordinance
provides that the liquors mentioned shall
not be consumed upon the premises and

The impression is gaining ground in the
north that the season just opening will be
a great one for scows and barges on the
lakes and the. river. The water is ver/
low, and it is slow In rising. The Sybil
was comDelled to return to Dawson on
Wednesday on account of the low water
at Hells Gate. She is said to have found
only six inches there. The sawmill men
and those with barges are looking for
ward to a good season.
Dawsonites arriving to-Say say that the
clean-up is turning out wonderfully well.
Three claims on Eureka Creek yielded
$50,000 each in five days' work at the com
mencement of the gpriris run, and many
other properties are exceeding expecta
tions. Two claims on El Dorado pur
chased last year by Seattle parties are
turning out gold at the rate of $9000 a
day In the preliminary clean-up.
Dawson trade is reported by the arrivals
to be sluggish and there Is no shortage of
goods. Hay was selling a w%ek ago at
$110 a ton and oats at $160 a ton. Eggs
taken over the ice brought $27 a crate.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 31.â The first
Klondike miners who came from Dawson
on the river boats which left there a
week ago to-day arrived this aftarnoon at
Vancouver on the steamer City of Se
attle. Twenty men came out on the first
steamer, the Bailey, but the vessel was
delayed in making the bar at Lower le
Barge, with the result that the few who
finally got through had to mush in over
slush and snow to White Horse and
thence to Skagway by train. R. L. Vin
ins and A. E. Barton, two Dawson mer
chants, were the first to reach Skagway.
They had a terrible trip over marshes
and through bogs and â¢ were nearly
drowned on two occasions by falling:
into hidden sloughs.
The Clifford Slfton and the Sybil,
which left Dawson in the middle of the
week," are bringing out the. first consign
ment of gold. They have about $600,000
between them, the bulk of this. being for
the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the
British North American, while about
$100,000 is being brought in individual
shipments for mining men.

SLAYERS OF RICE
ARE SENTENCED
FATAL SHOOTING
ENDS A QUARREL
The Judge observed that a different rea
soning would apply to Buckley and Mo
ran, who, the evidence showed,' acted in
concert at the time of Â¦ the killing, and
that they were guilty either of murder
of the first degree or not guilty of mur
der at all. The Judge intimated his own
belief that all of the persons involved in
the conspiracy had not been brought to
justice. .. . ; .
such criminal enterprise only went to the
extent of a felonious assault upon Rice,
the evidence showing that they had not
actually participated in the killing and
were, not immediately present at the scene
thereof, murder of the second' .degree
would be appropriate. Â¦ . - Â¦
The Judge' also pointed out that the evi
dence Â¦ in neither of these cases'. was so
convincing on the point as to whether
or not, the connection, of : Donnolly,- and
Duncan with the criminal enterprise "con
templated the murder of Rice as, the defi
nite, object 'thereof, as to -justify -him in
assuming that the defendants were guilty
of murder of , the. first decree. in the- face
of the finding by the jury that they were
guilty of- murder- of the 1 second degree.
In other words, 1 if their connection with
REFERS TO EVIDENCE.
The Judge in passing on the merits of
the Hice murder charge against Donnolly
expressed himself as being in sympathy
with the recommendation of mercy made
by the Jury. He pointed put that the evi
dence was convincing that the defendant
had been in a state of intoxication for
some time prior to and leading up to the
assault upon Rice, and that, in all proba
bility, if it had not been for this debauch
he might not have been - involved In the
crime. In the. case of Duncan the Judge
took a stronger view of his culpability,
and stated that the evidence justified the
belief- that Duncan was an active.; force
in the hatching of the conspiracy .which
culminated in the murder of Rice.> And
that, notwithstanding the fact that Don
nolly had a prior conviction and that
Duncan was a person of previous good
character, that on the merits of the situa
tion as they were presented to his under
standing. Duncan's case called j for the
heavier penalty. â¢
It will be recalled that in this case Ber
nard Sherry sat as a substitute for his
son. John H. Sherry, who had been sum
moned as a Juror. The Judge denied the
motion to set aside the verdict on this
ground, finding that the counsel for Dun
can were informed of the substitution
prior to the submission of the case to the
Jury, and thereby speculated on the ac
tion of the jury. . ~. . Â¦

Parkhurst, for example, rising up 'after five months of Mayor Low's reform administration in New '
York City snd declaring, "The demoralization of the police is woise than. it was under Tammany/' /
The discussion of the subject at San Jose is riot yet made public, ;. but doubtless will be.
The executive committee of the monetary conference and the Banking and Currency Committee
have regarded the "measure as a necessary reform in our national banking system, and a means of
more evenly distributing the loan'fund of the country, which now has a tendency to congest in
the financial centers, making money cheap there, while it is dear in other parts of the country. J
This condition has been artfully used to sustain arguments on the volume of currency, when
the difficulty has been in distribution and not in volume. Of couise such flexibility must not be
secured at the expense of safety, and the Fowler bill is intended to make the issue oil other assets
as safe as that based on United States bonds. If this cannot be done/ no such bill should pass.
The Call will gladly assist to a right understanding, of the measure and holds an impartial position
for that purpose. - ; V^.;/'- iftSiB
fHE California Bankers' Association; in session at San Jose, has passed a resolution oppos
ing the Fowler bill for giving a more flexible currency by authorizing an emergency issue
of national bank notes based upon authorized assets other than United States bonds As
this is the bill favored by the executive committee of the monetary conference and is
favorably reported by the House Committee on Banking and .Curr^nc^, it becomes of great im
portance to know the objections to it which induced its disfavor by our bankers, and whether
that disfavor is shared generally by the bankers of the country. . ., \
THE BANKERS AND FOWLER'S BILL
When Congress first rolled up appropriations to the sum of a billion dollars Tom Reed,
who was then Speaker of the House, met the clamor of the time by the simple statement, "We
have a billion dollar country." Since that time the country has grown. We have money enough
to throw hundreds of millions of dollars at the Filipinos, who not only are birds, but birds in the
bush. It would seem, therefore, that we might have some to burn at"home in the way of adorning
our cities 2nd improving our rivers and harbors. If the expenditure of. so much on distant islands
be not counted extravagance/ surely what we make use of at home might be looked upon
It may be conceded that much of the money to be expended fo.r rivers and harbors and
for public buildings has been unwisely distributed, though it would be difficult to get any wide
agreement upon the specific points in which the unwisdom is displayed. New York, Boston, Phila
delphia and Chicago complain that so much money is expended in small cities, but the small
cities, with equal fervor, complain that large sums are expended at the great cities. If it were
possible for the critics of Congress to make a thorough investigation of the various appropriations
they might find that on the whole Congress had made the distribution about as well as' it
can be made. .
The clamor is the more notable because 'there was nothing of that sort heard when Con
gress made appropriations for the army> the navy and the administration in the Philippines. Those
appropriations for war were far in excess of those designed for the construction of buildings and
the betterment of rivers and harbors. Senator Hoar estimates that in the last three years we have
expended about $600,600,000 for the purpose of establishing empire in the Philippines. No one
denounces that expenditure as a job, nor in discussing it makes taunting allusions to pork. .It is
only when we are going to improve our own country that we become so interested in economy ' as
to grumble if .-tHe Government devote a few thousand' dollars to provide a postoffice building for
Podunk or appropriate a sum of money to improve the waterways of Buncombe County.
BECAUSE the public buildings bill an|d the river and harbor bill taken together provide
for the expenditure of about $100,000,000 there has arisen through the length and
breadth of the country a clamor against what is called the extravagance of Congress. In
the clamor are many voices/ and they range in ! their utterances from fierce denun
ciations of boodle and jobbery to sarcastic references to "pork." Their one point in common is
that the appropriations made for internal improvements are' wasteful of public money and are ap
plied in many cases where they are not needed.; .',:";Â¦
EXTRAVAGANCE OR ECONOMY
STEPHEN PHILLIPS of "Paola
and Francesca" and "King Herod"
fame has again added to his dis
tinguished account with possibly
the most important dramatic clas
tic of recent days, "Ulysses," a poetic
drama in a prologue and three acts. Pro
duced in London now four months ago
by Beerbohm Tree at Her Majesty's The
ater, "Ulysses" created there a profound
sensation. Critics of the drama in Eng
land very generally regard the play as
the promise and portent of the lons
looked-for renaissance of the dramatic
art, neither forgetting the significance of [
the extraordinary interest in .the produc- j
tion taken by the public. Mr. Tree's en- i
terpripe in producing a drama of the |
kind in the magnificent manner in which |
"Ulysses" has been given under his direc- !
tion has also been accorded no mean 1
ehare of praise, and has doubtless aided j
materially in its success. The play has
row held the stage for * something like
four months with unvarying success,
emply proving that its mode is not merely
of the "sucees de curiosite" kindâ that.
Indeed, one may know by reading Mr.
Phillips' stately measures.
Possibly less' purely poetic than "Paola
and Francesca." "Ulysses" is incompara
bly stronger from the dramatic stand
point. With a local color that ranges
from Olympus to Hades, from Calypsos'
enchanted isle to the palace of the ltha
can Kin?. Mr. Phillips has dared a setting
of the Homeric story that has been at
tempted by none of his predecessors in
the adaptation of the "Odyssey." Unlike
M. Ponsard. tyhose "Ulysses," written to
Gounod's music, was a light of th"e Com
edy Franeaise once upon a time, and Rob
ert Bridges in his "Return of Ulysses,"
Mr. Phillips has seen fit to picture two of
Ulysses' celebrated adventures, that, as
the author pays in a note to the play,
"seemed to me to afford matter for telling
dramatic presentment and dramatic con
trast." The two chosen are the hero's
eojourn on Calypso's isle and the trial in
Hades, that have been woven with deft
mastery into the web of the lthacan
scenes, and. as affording background for
the portrait of Ulysses, are peculiarly
valuable. Mr. Phillips nas taken many
unavoidable liberties with his text, de
parting widely in some instances from
the story. The Hades, as the author sayÂ».
is "conceived on lines that are rather
VIrgilian than Homeric," and more Phil-
Upian than either. Calypso's enchantment
1b made to precede the hero's wanderings
in Hades, and the Cgygian sea nymph
Jierself is painted In Circean color. The
later scenes in the palace at Ithaca are
necessarily much compressed, new inci
dent imagined and the action proper re
arranged. But Mr. Phillips has succeeded
in building a play at once highly pictur
esque and poetic, strongly dramatic and
excellently actable. Its scope is of the
noblest and it Is kept wonderfully well in
key throughout. The situations occur in
finely natural fashion and the interest of
the play is very cleverly cumulative",
from the serio-comic prologue among the
peds on Olympus, through the suitors'
revels at Ithaca, the hero's willing

Miss Flood has made another heart glad
with her generosity. She has a quiet, sen
sible way of going about her charitable
work, trying to keep it a secret, but things
will leak out once in a while. , This time
it is a generous cash wedding present to
the daughter of a man who was for years
in. the service of the family. Miss Flood
feels very kindly toward this employe
and also his wife, who willingly waited
upon Miss Flood in a long Illness, al
though not under the slightest . ob
ligation to do so. Consequently, to
express her . gratitude, Miss Flood
bought a lot on Jones street and
thereon erected two flats at a cost of
$20,000. furnisfrjd a home for the couple
and handed over a deed for everything
so that Mr. and Mrs. have a home aÂ«
long as they live and rent the other flat
for $40 a month. I understand that the
new home was completely equipped, hav
ing linen enough for a. score of years.
Some handsome pieces of furnltur* were
brought from Miss Flood's Menlo Park
residence, which she sold because of its
painful memories. Everything else was
brand new when the counle were invited
to take possession. Now that their daugh
ter is going to be married Miss Flood re
members her handsomely. I believe Mrs
Jim Flood made a similar present so the
bride-elect will be made twice glad and
more to be envied than a girl born with
a gold spoon in her mouth but with no
luck.
One of the most striking gowns in the
charming girl's trousseau was one she
wore at the dinner given for the bridal
party on Friday evening. It was of pale
blue crepe de chine appliqued in large
liowers cut out of creton and embroidered
in red tones. The flowers and. leaves were
placed on the front of the bodice and at
interval on the skirt. A twist of leaf
green, pink and blue velvet outlined the
top of the collar.
The bride is especially charming in her
new lavender silk poplin over yellow taf
feta and appliqued ;wlth pale yellow.
There is a vest of rich renaissance lace
and a jabot of black velvet ribbon at the
neck to give it character.
The "going away" gown was a sen
sible affair of brown etamine tjver taffeta.
The entire gown was of horizontal folds.
The flounce at the bottom of the skirt
was trimmed with stitched straps. The
collar was finished with a bit\ of light
blue Piping, embroidered with beads. Over
this gown was worn a long coat of black
moire silk, with broad reveres and col
lar trimmed with ecruMace. The hat was
of -white straw, faced with black. The
broad brim was bent up on the left side
with a large black, quill. The -hat was
draped with a black chiffon scarf, the
edges of which were embroidered with
white. ' ;
IF we are to judge a bride's popularity
by the numben of presents she re
ceives then that of the last will seem
greater than was enjoyed by thoss
who went to the altar, before her.
Every time a roomful of wedding gifts
is displayed we wonder where they a.l
came from and if there are any left.
Then we marvel at how dear the Bin Is ,
to be so generously remembered. At tne
time of the Huntington-Perkins wedding
a Wells-Fargo man alone called seven
times a day to deliver parcels, to say
nothing of the drivers from the stores.
Then to make matters more complicated
the man behind the counter at the leading
store of its kind . in this city makes a
practice of telling us 'that that particular
bride is receiving a larger array of pres
ents than any in the history of the house.
This, too, makes every bride seem dearer
than the last. . â¢
Miss Alice Gardner certainly has much
to be happy about, as she received sucn
loads ot pretty things. There are many
handsome pieces of cut glass, china, sil
ver and bric-a-brac. Ex-senator Preston,
the groom's father, gave the bride a check
for a new sealskin, which she will doubt
less lose no time in ordering as soon as
she returns from the wedding trip. Her
own parents have given a handsome set
of furniture. The groom's gift was a dia
mond sunburst. All this for a girl who
is still in her teens and has only recently
finished at school. Miss Gardner was to
have made her formal debut in society
last winter, but by the time her gowns
were finished she had become engaged to
Dr. Preston and decided society could not
be as interesting as her young Borneo.
Hence the wedding last evening.
Ulyeses, with Hermes as guide, de
scends into Hades, meeting Agamemnon
and other noble shades, all with words of
woe for him. Souls of suicides, of little
children, of lovers unsatisfied throng
about him and lastly his mother. whÂ«Vas
sures him of Penelope's truth. Thus
guerdoned, he fights back to the earth.
The last scenes take place In Ith&ca. at
the swineherd's hut, and in Ulysses* pal
ace, and splendidly dramatic they are.
Ulysses, stranded at last on lthacan
shores, in rags and asleep, is contended
for for the last time by Athene and
Poseidon. Ulysses knows hardly that he
has at last reached home and welcomes
it In some lovely stanzas. He makes him
self known to Eumaeus, the swineherd
and to his son Telemaelius, plotting wlfh
his famous craft to master the army of
suitors. Here Antinous. Ctesippus and
.Eurymaelius, chief among the suitors
have threÂ» admirably characteristic
ppeeches. answered in noble wise by Pe
nelope. The action throughout in -pictur
esque and dramatic in the extreme and
the act closes with the stage empty but
for Penelope and Ulysses in each other's
arms, where one may, with Mr. Phillips,
very properly leave them.
Doth not the region even now
Strike to thy heart? These warning: cypress
trees, . .Â¦
This conscious umbrage cowering on the ground
The creeping- up of the slow, fearful foam; '
Rocks rooted in the terror of some cry
That, rang In the beginning of the world;
All nature frlghte'd . into barrenness.
Lo. mortal, here the very gate of death
And this no other than the gate of hell!
Not on quit? so high level, but of re
joarkable beauty are the lines of Athene
in the next act. that takes plane In H*3des.
Ulyeses has arrived at the gate, of hell
and knows not that he has to sound it,s
horrors. He asks Athene where he is.
She replies:
The first act shows the revels of
the suitors of Penelope, in Ulysses'
palace at Ithaca, with the des
perate efforts of Penelope to put
off the decision to marry one of them.
It ends with a beautiful invocation of the
faithful -wife to her absent lord. Scene
the second shows Ulysses in the sea cave
of Calypso, his ship beached, his' com
rades scattered and himself a willing
slave to Calypso's lude. To them comes
Hermes, and touching the hero with his
caduceus frees him from the sea-nymph's
witcheries, afterward ordering Calypso to
"waft him on the deep, if in his heart he
hungers for his home." Ulysses, treed
from the spell, remembers Ithaca. Penel
ope, his kingdom, and turns suddenly cold
lo the enchantress' wiles. Calypso pleads
eloquently to know why he should be
content again to seek dangers unheard
cf to win back only a mortal woman, to
know what Ithaca can hold for him after
Ogygla. At last Ulysses replies In these
splendid lines:
Th*n have the truth: I speak es a man speaks;
Tour out my heart like treasure at your feet.
This odorous, amorous isle of violets.
That leans all leaves unto the glassy deep.
With brooding music over noontide moes.
And low dirge of the lily-swinging bee â
Then stars like opening eyes on closing flowers,
Pall* oji my heart. Ah, God! that I might see
Gaunt Ithaca Ftand up out of the surge,
Yon lashed and streaming rocks and sobbing:
crags.
The screaming gull and the wild-flying clouds â
To see far off the smoke of my own hearth.
To smell far out the glebe of my own farms.
To spring alive upon her precipices.
And hurl the singing spear Into the air;
To scoop the mountain torrent In my hand.
And plunge into the .midnight of her pines;
To look into the eyes of hÂ«r who bore me.
And clasp his knees who gat me in his joy, j
Prove if my son be like my dream of him.
We two hand-played and tossed each other
Â¦words;
Goddess and mortal we have met and kissed.
Now am I mad for silence and for tears.
For the earthly voice that breaks at earthly
Ills
The mortal hands that make and smooth the
bed.
I am a-hungered for that human breast.
That bosom a sweet hive of memories â
There, there to lay my head before I die,
There, there to.be. there only, there at last!
The first scene of "Ulysses" opens on
Mount Olympus, where Pallas Athene is
pleadirig witn Tyeus to release Ulysses
from the spell of Calypso Poseidon, who
has a kick coiningâ as Mr. Phillips al
most but not quite says in colloquial
Olympian protests, and there is a tooth
and-nail scene between the two. Zeus,
a good-natured sort of a god, commands
them to stop quarreling, and after being
leminded by Hermes and Aphrodite that
even the immortals have genially strayed:
'Tis true that earthly women had their share
In this large bosom's universal care, . . ; :.
That Danae. Leda. Leto all had place
In my most broad, beneficent embrace.. Â¦-
True that we gods who on Olympus dwell.
With mortal passion sympathize too well. â¢ ,
And decides that Ulysses shall be freed,
ending the session with:
The cup. bright Gannymede! ah, from the first,
The guiding oi this globe engendered thirst.
But some of Phillips' noblest lines are
also to be found in the drama. The char
acters, too, are drawn in in clear and
deep line from Ulysses himself to his
faithful swineherdi Eumaeus, and alto
gether, possibly the renaissance is at
hand. Let us pray. . .
prisonment in Calypso's arms, thence to
the dark mysteries of Hades, to the final
triumps of the wanderer in his hardly
tioii lthacan halls. The lyrics, from the
literary side, are the weakest spot in the
piay, and at times there is a little forcing
of the poetic machinery, as when Telem
achus. angered at the suitors' waste of
his father's wealth, says: .
I'll flit no more a phantom at your feasts, ;
Discouraged and dtetarded and disdained.
FAMOUS ENGLISH ACTOR WHO
PRODUCED STEPHEN PHILLIPS'
NEW POETIC DRAMA.
Our task is to prove the negative oi these propositions in the Philippines. It is a great
task and worthy of a great people. But heretofore none has succeeded in it, no matter how
small and weak the objects of the experiment. . ; .*-'*'â¢ ";.
Careful readers of the President's speech will find in it the same form of statement that was
in his message. He defers the final decision of what" is to be done; with the Philippines to an in
definite'future. After their lesson is? learned, when we decide that their knowledge of self-gov
ernment is sufficient, after we do in their case what we never permitted any power to do in ours,
then we are "to decide whether they are to exist independently of- us." Meantime we are to
govern them and teach them. ; .
; The late Thomas F. Bayard while Embassador to Great Britain gave as a reason for our
capacity for self-government that we "are a people so strong and self-willed as to be ungovern
able by any power but ourselves.'* Heretofgrean all history it has been proved that only such a
people can be self-governing, and it has been believed that submission to government by others
is evidence that there : is no germ of self-goVernment in those who-submit. -
But that is just what we, who are now self-governing, underwent for a thousand years.
Church and state: combined against self-government and slew the world's wisest and best, as mar
tyrs to liberty. It was only when man learned that such should be heard, and. not murdered, that
he entered into the alphabet of self-government. The task which the President believes we have
undertaken is that of forcing a hostile people; to sit in a class and be taught self-government.
Those among them who desire this to be done are so few in number that withdrawal of our protec
tion means their immediate slaughter. Truly, human wisdom cannot foretell the end of such a
task. The Greeks taught themselves self-government, but they never imparted it to others. The
Romans enjoyed it for a time, but lost it .by Undertaking dominion of conquered people to whom
they could not impart it. England has never succeeded in teaching it to other races in any part
of her extensive empire. We have; not taught it to other races in contact with us. Can we teach
it to such a mixture of races so far awav?
Continuing, the President said: ''When that day will come it is not in human wisdom now
to foretell. All that we can say with certainty is that it would be put back im immeasurable dis
tance if we should yield to the councils of -.rnmanly weakness and turn loose the islands to see
our victorious foes butcher with revolting cruelty our betrayed friends, and shed the blood of the
most humane, the most enlightened, the most peaceful, the wisest and best cf their own number."
That franchise which we learned by fighting for it was hot taught us by others. No out
side force decided when we were fit to receive it. No power instructed us, or held us in check until
it was decided that we were fit to be free. \ Â¦;â¢ .
As. the President well says, we taught .ourselves self-government by a thousand years of
labor. Can it be taught by others? Up to these days it has" never been taught to one people by
another.. We have; not taught our way of self-government to the Indians or the negroes. To pre
serve self-government to our' own race in thirteen States of this Union their people have re
garded it tc be. necessary to take from the' negro his ballot,* which is the sole expression and in
strument of self-government as we have taught, it tb: ourselves by a thousand years of toil.
I v N his Decoration day address at Arlington the President suggested a policy that'will attract
universal. attention and the study of scholars in civics far into the future. He said: .''The
slowly learned and difficult art of self-government, an art which our people have taught
themselves; by the labor of a thousand years, cannot be grasped in a day by a people only
just emerging from conditions of life which our ancestors left behind them in the dim years before
history dawned. We believe that we can rapidly teach the people of the Philippine Islands not
only how to enjoy but how to make good use of their' freedom; and with their growing knowl
edge their growth in self-government shall keep steady pace: When they -have thus shown their
capacity for real freedom by their power of self-government, then, and not till then, will it be pos
sible to decide whether they are to exist independently of us, or be kait to us by ties of common
friendship and interest." :'Â¦.''Â¦Â¦'<Â¦

CAUGHT IN ACT
Tha Rev. Jacob Voorsanger preached a
memorial sermon yesterday morning, tak
ing as his- subject the "Education of the
Future Generations."
Dr. Vcor3anger said that history was the
A B^C of the nations. A nation without
history was either in its Infancy or dead.
Forty years after the tremendous struggle
of the Civil War we are asking what it all
meant. The men who fought cannot tell
us as well as those who belong to the
later generation and look at the facts of
history with greater impartiality.
The speaker- showed the effect of slav
ery on the people's idea of liberty before
the constitution was adopted, and the in
fluence of slavery and of the doctrine of
State sovereignty on the young nation,
ending in the conflict that could not be
averted.. The Civil, War settled those
problems, not at once, for there had to be
thÂ© education that came after the war
But they are: settled now. California is
not our sovereign nation, but our State,
and the bear, flag is not in any sense co
ordinate with the stars and stripes. And
while there. may be slavery of whites in
Europe there Is no. slavery ot. blacks in
the United States, Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦rr.v 'Â¦'

It was finally decided, so as to prevent
the possibility of a recurrence of the ir
regularity in the case of the order for the
withdrawal of the bail in the Jessie Hol
land matter, that the plan suggested by
the Treasurer to send the receipt for the
bail money along with the order on the
Treasurer be adopted, at least till it could
be seen if It .worked satisfactorily. In the
case of another man presenting the order
and receiat other than the one named in
the receipt the Treasurer will, before pay
ing the money, satisfy himself as to the
reason why the holder of the documents
has them in his custody. Judge Fritz has
been following out the Treasurer's sug
gestion since it was made. â¢ .
. Judge Mogan said he would devote half
an hour each morning to making the ap
plicants for ball money testify under oath
as to their Qualification to receive the
order on the Treasurer. , \
The question of the best mode to be
adopted in regard to the withdrawal of
bail money was . discussed*, for over an
hour in Judge Mogan's chambers yester
day. Those present were Judges Mogan
and Cabaniss; C. B. Perkins and Louis

The fact that they are to close out
their Market-street store in order to give
their entire time and attention to this
new enterprise will mark the passing of
a landmark en Market street of many
years' standing. â¢ >.
Kohlberg, Strauss & Frohman have
made wonderful strides during the past
few years and with the full weight "of
the general management thrown upon the
one greater establishment, their Post
street store should show a remarkably
rapid development.
The closing out of the Market-street
stock will be the occasion of a special sale
to which the attention of the San Fran

is announced in the advertising columns.
The announcement made to-day by
Kohlberg, Strauss & Frohman to the ef

They are Frank Willard, living at 12 Kis
llng street, and Albert Patterson; who re
sides wltH his Darents at 580 O'Farrell
street. Both of them give their age as 16
years. ;
Several times during the last six weeks
the offices of William A. Weil, an a/1
vertising circular distributor at 106 Pine
street, has been entered, desks forced
open and small sums of money and
stamps taken. Detective Riordan was or
dered to investigate, and last night con
cealed himself in the front office in hopes
the intruders might come again. About
10 o'clock he heard the street door open
and the steps of two persons enter the
wholesale cigar establishment of Posoner
& Levin, on the opposite side of the hall
way. After a short time they came out
and entered Weil's offices by opening one
of the doors with a key. As the intruder
entered the room where Riordan was he
caught sight of the officer and slammed
the door shut. It became locked and sev
eral minutes elapsed before the officer
could open it and give pursuit. When he
reached the hallway he could see no one,
but he fired a shot into the floor and by
the light of the flash he caught a glimpse
of Patterson, crouching in a corner. He
hauled him out. and started down the
stairway, at the foot of which he found
Willard. Both boys confessed that they
were responsible for the series of bur
glaries at this place, but say they were
not guilty of any others. They had three
boxes of cigars taken from Posener &
Levin and a bunch of skeleton keys.

Superintendent "Webster sent a commu

just completed shows 83,000 children of
school age in this city., and there would
be a deficit of $45,750 in the State appor

sum of $60,000 be clipped from the gross
appropriation of $1,250,000 for schools,
which motion was carried.
The fund for lighting the streets was in

Braunhart's motion that the item of

against the item of $2100 for Office Deputy

Brandenstein declared there is no occa-Â»
sion for the maintenance of three emer
gency hospitals and suggested that one
main emergency hospital be more central
ly located and a system of automobile am
bulances be installed. He moved that the
sum of $9000 be cut out of the appropria
tion of $33,600 for emergency hospitals,
thus doing away with the harbor hospital,
tut the TOOtion was lost by a vote of 7
in favor and 8 against. D'Ancona urged
that the sum of$l'0,000 be allowed the
City and County Hospital, but $38,000 was
set aside for salaries and $67,000 for main
tenance. The allowance of $700,000 for
maintenance ana $115,000 for expenses of
the Fire Department was adopted. The
department of elections was allowed
$140,000. The item of $2000 for payments of
claims for services of O. B. Martin, A. J.
Raisch, S. H. Kent and H. C. Robinson
as appraisers for the extension of the
Park Panhandle was stricken out.
"It is estimated that there is an unused
surplus of $133,000 in the School Depart
-nent," said Brandenstein. "Against this
amount the sum of $60,000 covers contracts
already entered into by the Board of
Education."

the understanding that 52000 will be set

the Chief Sanitary Inspector be raised
from $1500 to $1800 per year, he to act as

staggering around near the hotel early
yesterday morning with his nose bleed

saulted and robbed of $65, but he did not
know where or by whom. He was sent
to the Central Emergency Hospital,
where it was discovered that his nose was
fractured. He was locked up on a charge
of being drunk. At the hotel it was stat
ed that Lang had on deposit there an or

The builders 1 association will decide
upon a plan of settlement, which it is
hoped will be satisfactory to both fac
tions. This will probably be agreed upon
before to-morrow night and finally sub
mitted to the councils engaged In the
struggle.
The Building Trades Council is anx
ious to settle the war by. allowing the
carpenters to vote on the " rescission of
the objectionable clause in the"' constitu
tion which prohibits affiliated unions from
belonging to any other central body. The
brotherhood men say they are willing to
do this, provided only brotherhood meri
are allowed to vote. As Union 22, which
has remained loyal to the . council
throughout the fight and has been sus
pended by the brotherhood, -would thus
be debarred from voting, the council ob
jects to the plan.
A well attended meeting of the Build
ers' Protective Association was held last
night, at which the carpenters" contro
versy and its settlement were discussed at
length. Several committees from the dis
trict council of the brotherhood and the
Building Trades Council were in attend
ance and gave their views concerning the
proposition advanced by the latter body
to refer the matter to a majority vote of
the carpenters themselves.

Blaisdell Is expected to defend his right
to retain possession of about $7500 worth
of property Â¦ he bought for his wife. ' â¢
Immediately upon his rise to wealth
"Dicky" ceased to know some of his old
associates, and since then he has culti
vated new acquaintances, especially in
the California Club. The financial and
other differences between these young
persons have stirred up a civil war be
tween their respective families.
Mrs. Margaret Gertrude Blaisdell "inher
ited more than a half-million dollars
from her father. Charles Gossage. -who at
the time of his death, about fifteen or
twenty years ago, was a dry goods mer
chant prince of Chicagoâ a business rival
of Marshall Field. Mrs. Blaisdell tells her
intimates that "Dicky" has "blown in"
at least half of her fortune and has added
nothing to It.
The young Mr. Blaisdell has not pre
tended to do any business since he mar
ried the wealthy heiress in San Francisco
some years ago. By that stroke of good
luck he rose from a clerk in an insurance
office to the ostensible possessor of a
half-million. Anyway he got a wife who
had that much.
LOS ANGELES, May 31.â Society circles
are shocked by disclosures of domestic
infelicity in the home of a couple distin
guished in the local "400." The suit of
Mrs. Margaret Gertrude Blaisdell to re
strain Ricnard P. Blaisdell from transfer
ring certain property that was bought
with part of the wife's patrimony was sim
ply tne iirst formal action in tne exploit
ing of the family differences. In fact, it
is said by persons who are In a position
to know that the young couple parted
company a year ago, the wife taking her
baby. The time that has since elapsed
has been passed by her in Chicago and
San Francisco, while "Dicky" has lin
ger<-d here. And, what is more, say the
gossips, Mrs. Blaisdell and the baby had
been away two month;; before the hus
band and father could .ascertain their
whereabouts.

payers of St. Louis have been mercilessly and
pitilessly outraged for years, that the money
they have paid in taxes has been squandered
instead of being used for public welfare it has
bttn feloniously dissipated and benefited' chiefly
corrupt officials, who have grown opulent on
small salaries.
While there may have been corruption in
other cities as great as we have had here, yet
in no r> lace in the world and at no time known
to history has so much official corruption been
uncovered and the evidence shown so that all
could see and understand. These revelations
have been so appalling as to be almost beyond
belief, and It will be years before the extent
of the discoveries is fully realized.
If the affairs of St. Louis had been properly
administered for the past fifteen years, and If
all officials -had been honest, there would to
day be enough money In the treasury to put
public buildings in repair, pave the streets that
are now unpaved, malre sewers that are now
unmade and build new buildings eo much need
ed. The high tax rate, the deplorable condition
of public institutions, the depleted state of the
city treasury are a heritage left by officials
who have proved traitors to the interests of the
people and have trafficked In their votes, in
fluence and official actions, to the city's detri
ment.

THE CHALLENGER WINS HANDILY
Challenger, which up to this point had
sailed the same course as the Harpoon,
tack for tack, split tacks off Alcatraz
Island ; many yachtsmen thought â¢ W. G.
Morrow was committing a fatal . error.
Cook pursued the usual plan of making
a number of short tacks inshore, while
Morrow stood higher :and made a long
leg toward the windward mark. The wis
dom of the course pursued by Morrow
soon became apparent, for the Challenger
rounded the windward mark for the ser
ond time at 3:43:40, while the Harpoon did
not round it till 3:51:28. The Challenger
was then 7 minutes 4S seconds to the good,
with a time allowance of 3 minutes 43
seconds due her in addition. The Chal
lenger crossed the finishing line at 3:55:38
and the Harpoon at 4:02:49.
The racing length, of the Harpoon was
32.87 feet and that of the Challenger was
taken at 30 feet, the length named in the
letter of challenge. Frank Bartlett rep
resented the Corintniah Yacht Club on
board the Challenger. Robert Haley was
the San Francisco representative on board
the Harpoon. The crew of the Challenger
consisted of W. G. Morrow (captain), C.
F. Austin, J. C. Cockerill, A. C. Lee. R.
S. Bridgman arfi- J. R. Savory. The Har
poon s crew was made up of Fred Russ

ment of the regatta committees of the
two clubs, the Corinthian representatives
be.ng E. B. Learning, T. J. Kavanaugli
and P. J. Martenstein. The San Francisco
members were Dr. T. U Hill, A. R.
Haskins and F. Spencer. The referee was
Sydney. S. Marshall, commodore of the
California Yacht Club. The officials and
m&ny yachtsmen with their friends
viewed the race from the steamer Sunol,

You receive Grape-Nuts from the gro-
cer ready to serve, as it has been thor-
oughly cooked at the factory by food ex-
perts, and this saves heat from cooking
and time and exertion necessary in pre-
paring ordinary food.
One pound cf Grape-Nuts has more
nourishmentâ that the system, will ab-
Fert>â than ten pounds of meat, without
any of the internal heat of meat that a
person wishes to avoid during the warm
soason; its rich, nutty flavor added to the

a dish pleasing to the most critical taste.
A most appetizing and healthful break-
fast can be made on Grape-Xuts and
cream, some fruit and perhaps two soft
boiled eggsâ this meal will furnish full

Other Pianos at Frices Less
liian Asked Elsewhere for
Ordinary Instruments of Lit-
tie or No Reputation,
Also Bargains in Slightly Used
Pianos That Would Readily
Pass ior New.
From the foundation of this house, its
policy has been to sell reliable, trust-
worthy piancs at honest prices. Pianos
that could be conscientiously guaranteed
to stand the test of time and to give un-
questioned satisfaction to the purchaser.
The public has been extremely generous
in their patronageâ so generous that we-
have grown steadily day by day until to-
day we are acknowledged to be the lead-
ing as well as the largest music houso
west of Chicago and the recognized head-
quarters for pianos and organs.
SOME STAR 1 LING FRIGES.
Think of a brand new, fancy mahogany
or mottled walnut cased, largest sized
. cabinet grand, strictly high-grade upright
piano' that has never been sold for less
than $450 before now going at $318, and
others equally as fine for $2$6. The J328
styles for S218, $212 and $185, and still oth-
era for $163, $158, $137 and $118, all of them
brand new instruments and sold on easy
payments if desired.
SLATHERS OF THEM,
In second-hand pianos we have simply
slathers of them, uprights and squares,
good ones, fine ones and bum ones, all of
them at prices just about half what they
are really worth. Ever hear of an uprignt
piano for $18? Here is one; pay $1 a month
if you like. Other pianos for $45, $85, $87:
and $93; also on very easy payments.
Excellent and really very valuable
pianos, such as Crown, $237; A. B. Chase
$225; Kimball, $210; Hinze. $169; Steck, $150 :
Singer (nearly new), $166; Lester and nu-
merous other makes. All of them have
been put in best possible order, and any
instrument secured at this sale will be
accepted at any time at price paid to-
ward the payment of any new Decker
Hazelton, Kimball, Lester or Crown
piano.
SQUARES A BLOCK LONG.
Then come the square pianosâ look at
them: Chickerings,. Webers, Kranich &
Bach, Raven & Bacon, Haines and numer-
ous others. A row nearly a bJock long
Prices, $28, $127, $35 and $96. Name the
price you wish to invest and we will
furnish you a square piano for it; but ev-
erything is less than the above mentioned
highest price. Payments: We will take
$3 a month for these; that is, 10 cents a
day, the price of two papers or two bags
of peanuts. Why not have a piano In
tho house and give the little daughter a
chance to take up the study of the most
refining accomplishment that a young
lady can possibly possess.
ORGANS! ORGANS!
Then look at these organs. Every manu-
facturer- of ancient and modern, times iÂ«
represented here. Saturday . we sold a
Â¦beautiful antique melodeon for $18. We
have organs, pretty good ones, for as lit-
tle a3 $10. and we have others for $26,
$18, . $31. $3S, $41, $43, $20, $22 and $36. Any
old price. Payments a mere . monthly
song. We must have all organs out of the
way this week. Prices on new organs
are very seriously "butchered," too. It
takes very little money and much less
of an effort to own'a fine Kimball. Mason
& Hamlin or any other good make of
organ now: Come in and see." We sold
seven organs Saturday.

On the night of the trouble McGlynn,
who gave the name of Sullivan, told a
moving story of unprovoked assault and
brutal clubbing at the hands of the offi
cer. This incensed the proprietor of the
restaurant, and he took up the prosecu
tion of the case. When he ascertained the
real identity of McGlynn he had John
Buhrmann, the cashier, swear out a war
rant for his arrest. The defendant was
released en $30 cash bail by order of
Police Judge Fritz.
C. J. McGlynn, assistant paying teller I
of the Hibernia Bank, was taken Into !
custody last evening on a warrant charg
ing him with assault with a deadly
weapon and malicious mischief. The al
leged crime was committed two- weeks !
ago last night at Moraghan's restaurant in
the California Market. McGlynn had a
dispute with the cashier, and during it
attempted to break the cash register and
hit the cashier on the head with a bottle
Special Officer Porter clubbed McGlynn
into a peaceful mood and sent him to the

were handled by Clifford Middlemass. The
results of the judging in detail follow:
Station wagon â Won by George Aimer New
hall's entry.
In the automobile competition R. P.
Schwerin proved a dashing operator. He
defeated Laurance I. Scott and E. B. Mur
phy. With Mr. Schwerin was Miss Lucie
King. Mr. Murphy had Mrs. Laurance
Scott as a guest, while Miss Emily Wil
son appeared on Mr. Scott's "auto."
Walter Hobart and George Aimer New
hall displayed skill in tooling their four
in-hands. The former won. He also won
the high jumping* with Royalty and the
class for the best polo pony with Terry
McGovern, a pony as clever as a cat. In
the high jump Spectator came down with
Jerry Keating, neither rider nor horse be
ing injured.
There were several interesting competi
tions, especially one in which ladies drove.
Mrs. Laurance I. Scott proved the clever
est'"whip," with Miss Florence Whittell
second and Miss- Bourn third. Princess
Poniatowski, Mrs. Gus Taylor and Mrs.
H. T. Scott also competed. .The ladies
drove in and out among obstacles, dis
playing . great cleverness. There was a
heavy shower while they were in the
ring, which they faced fearlessly.
The lowering skies reduced the number
of spectators. As those who did attend
were garbed appropriately to meet the
weather conditions, the light and color of
the opening day were lacking.
Somber was the setting of the horse
show and fete yesterday at the Burlin
grame Country Club. Rain fell intermit
tently during the morning, making it
necessary to postpone the various events
scheduled for that time. A number of
these failed to fill, making it possible to
complete the programme at a seasonable
hour. ' ' ,
Beck of Yale, in the shot put, increased
the distance from 44 feet 3 inches, held
by himself since 1900, to 44 feet 8% inches.
New intercollegiate records were estab
lished in four of the eventsâ the hammer
throw, shot put, pole vault, quarter-mile
run and 100-yard dash. Dewitt of Prince
ton did not improve on his fine throw of
164 feet 10 inches made yesterday. Plaw
cf California was in better shape to-day
and threw the hammer 163 feet 8 inches,
an improvement of nineteen feet on his
best trial throw yesterday.
In the pole vault. Horton of Princeton
won first place with the bar at 11 feet 3
Inches. He then went after the inter
collegiate record of U feet 5 Inches and
cleared 11 feet 7 inches.
Arthur F. Duffey created a new world's
record in the 100-yard dash by winning in
9 3-5 seconds; Duffey will sail for Eng
land two weeks hence and will take pait
in several athletic meetings during his
stay abroad, where he hopes to repeat
the performance. The former record of
9 4-5 was established in 1890 by J. Owen
Jr. of "Washington, D. C. His time has
since been equaled by a number of sprint
ers.
NEW YORK, May Sl.^Harvard defeat
ed Yale in the contest for championship,
honors at the intercollegiate athletic mest Â¦
which began yesterday and â¢was concluded
to-day at Berkeley Oval. The total score
was 34 points to 30. Princeton finished
surprisingly close to the leaders, her rep
resentatives scoring 1 27 points.* . The ex
ecutive committee of the I. C. A. A. held
a brief meeting at the oval to-day to con
sider the protest made by Yale against
Schick of Harvard. If was decided to
allow the Harvard sprinter to compete in
the finals of the 100 and 220-yard dashes.
The committee adjourned the further
hearing of evidence in the case until June
14 or 21, when it will convene in this city
for the special purpose. Should the de
cision of the committee be adverse to
Schick,- Harvard will lose 6 points and
Yale will gain 2. Yale would thus win
the championship honors by a total of Â£J
to Harvard's 28.

There was never <any doubt in the
hearts of the faithful few who blew over
in the direction of Recreation Park yes
terday' as to who would possess ths
lumpy end of the finish of the baseball
game, but they went anyhow. It was the
oft-repeated tale of many errors for both
teams and many runs for one team.
Everybody knows who made the many
runsâ Oakland and Sacramento" played.
Steffanl twirled for the Senators and was
bumped hard at the proper moment. The
score: .
The. arrangements for the match were
â¢ admirable, and there was one of the
largest gatherings of English poloists
seen at Hurlingham for years. The ground
was rather sort after rain of- last night,
and. the bill did not travel freely at any
period. What, perhaps, was more aston
ishing than anything else was the Ameri
can ponies were at no time outpaced by
the English, although some famous ponies
were playing for England. It would have
been difficult to collect a better lot of
ponies. The American animals held their
o*n for speed and beat the English po
nils for handiness.
'Ihe hitting play of the -Americans was
magnificent. The English players were
sometimes close to the posts, and, in
deed, repeatedly shot at the goal. They
nearly always missed, or the ball was re
turned to them. Only three times in the
whole play did Buckmaster (English) have
a hit out from behind his own back line.
Nine times in one period the Americans
hit out of bounds to save their goali The
reason for this was that Waterbury's de
fense was nearly perfect.
An attack in so severe a game of polo
as was to-day's contest is bound to give
way at last if it fails to break the de
fenses, and so, when the welcome chance
came for the Americans to turn their po
nies and play with the ball instead of
against it, their forwards started fresh,
with a half-beaten, scattered team, op
posing them.
Then the long 1 practice of team play
told, and the Americans raced . through
their opponents as though the latter were
only novices, Agassiz (American) riding
off Miller (English), and Cowdin, Keene
and Waterbury (Americans) galloping ana
passing the ball from back to forward
with a series of splendid near side for
ward strokes. Thus Waterbury's defense
must be known as the main factor in the
victory. Then the American combination
play was much better than that of -the
Hurlingham four.
The Americans were always quicker on
the ball than their opponents.
LONDON, May 31.â The result of the
test polo match at Hurllngham to-day for
the American cup was a complete surprise
to all the experts, and was all the more
welcome to the huge gathering of Ameri
cans. According to previous form, the
Englishmen should have won. The Ameri
'can' team rose splendidly to the occasion
and played a nearly faultless game, much
better, in fact, than they ever played
heretofore. Waterbury and Keene were
the particular stars of the American team
and again and again saved the game.

Scientific Treatment
Many Men Treated for a Weakness Which Never Existed.
In the largest proportion of cases Lost Vitality. Prematureness and the train of
eyrnptoms known as "weakness," certain morbid conditions of the urethra and pros-
tate Eland, damaged by contracted disorder, or too-often-repeated and too-long-con-
tinued excitement, so react on the organs that a condition of diminished vitality
and function is induced. Our knowledge of the morbid changes in the organs them-
selves is quite clear and full, but how these changes operate on the nerves and
spinal cord center are mysteries to the medical profession. Whatever the morbid
change may be, however, the effects are apparent to the embarrassed sufferer; these
trout les being symptomatic of the above-mentioned and well-defined morbid condi-
tions, it seems that even the unprofessional patient must understand that stomach
drugging will not cure, but efforts directed toward repairing - the damaged tract
will resjore. In practice such is the case, as the treatment on these lines never
fails to. accomplish the desired result.
A specialist is one who makes a specialty of a given thing. "We are special-
ists for men's diseases and disorders, and after an experience of many years' suc-
ceesful practice on this coast, in which time we have built up the largest practice
ever enjoyed by any firm in our special line, we can honestly state to the public
that in our practice we have yet to have a single patient who can say that he has
not been given the careful and successful attention of our Dr. Talcott Our cures
have been marked with that success due to the result of years of patient study
and the adoption of original methods in the treatment of the many cases that
have come before us for our attention. Many have adopted our methods, but no one
has been able to accomplish for the patient the positive and permanent cure which
has resulted in our treatment of cur thousands of patients. We have honestly
made each case placed in our hands an individual case, giving to It our thought
our experience and attention that lias won for us golden opinions from others in our
jirofessicn and the earnest regard of those who have come to us afflicted with thÂ»
many disorders that man is heir to.

SOLEMN INVOCATION.
Tlie cantons were then formed in double
rank, halted, faced and each rank stepped
back three paces, crossed fiwords=. form
ing an arch under which the candidates
were, conducted under the escort of Gen
ral E. If. Black, who led them, to a stand
where there wus a bowl of; pure water
and informed them that they could not

pure hearts, with clean, hands, and bid
them lave, which they did. They were
then presented to the brigadier general,
who bid them knpel on the right knee and
rair-<Â» the risrht hand, and in that position
they made solemn obligation to continue
in the work of friendship, love and truth
in which they had labored so continuously
and meritoriously as to win the proud
distinction about to be conferred upon
them. While the obligaxion was adminis

close formed a circle and raising: their

still kneeling the first lady of honor, Mrs.

and the fourth lady of honor. Mrs. LeJa

each presentation there was delivered a

presented and how each should be used.
FORM IN DOUBLE RANK.
In the early part of the evening there
was concert musjc by the orchestra for
half an hour, after which the cantons
of the patriarchs from this city, Oak
land and Vallejo entered the hall and
were formed In three, sides of a hollow
square, the fourth being formed at the
head of the hall by Brigadier General
Brower, commanding the patriarchs of
the State, and the members of his staff,
all In. fuli dress uniform. The drill corps
of Canton No. 5 was then admitted and
took its position In the center of the
square, after which the chevaliers selected
to receive the honors entered, but were
halted at the inner portal by the senti
nel, who. being informed of the purpose
of the visit and the examination of cre
dentials, made the announcement of the
advent of the five applicants for honors
and was told to conduct them through
the proper avenues that they might re

IS PRONOUNCED FORGERY.
This bill, certified to as being correct
by Commissary Foley and Warden
Aguirre, is a forgery of the most pro
nounced "type. It was written by the
same prison hand that filled out the
forged bills of Levi Strauss & Co.
whereby a bill of goods for $11213, in
cluding nightshirts, was procured by
fraud and the State was made to pay
for the same Toy- a bogus Item of a bale
of cassimere for prison ctothing.
The forged bill of Lebenbaum & Co..
dated "May 17, 19â," was written by
the same prisoner who filled In the Levi
Strauss & Co.'s bills and was done un
der direction of officials of San Quen
tin prison.
The corrupt methods of procedure
employed by Warden Aguirre and his
skillful staff of prisoners at San Quentin
were still further revealed yesterday
by an investigation of the transactions
with C. Grosjean & Co. and Burtchaell
& Co., two of the principal grocery
houses of San Rafael. It was at these
two stores that Commissary Francis
Foley purchased some of the supplies
for Aguirre and his dependants and the
inquiry yesterday developed that it was
on the bills of these firms that the pris
oners at the penitentiary were called in
to use their skill. Photographic repro
ductions of these forged bills are given
in to-day's Call.
When photographs of bills purporting
to be of his firm were shown to E. S.
Rake, president of C. Grosjean & Co.,
he straightway declared that they were
not made out by him or any one in his
employ. ; He said that Commis
sary Foley had applied to him for a
number of blank billheads. Foley gave
as a reason for his request that he
needed the billheads to make out tripli
cate copies of each bill in order that
one might be kept at the prison and
two sent to Sacramento.
FORGED GROCERY BILLS.
Rake instructed his bookkeeper to
furnish the commissary department
with billheads, which was accordingly
done. From the .evidence which has
been obtained.^these bills were secured
not for the purpose of making copies as
was claimed by Foley but so that the
prisoners could more-easily make forged
bills to cover up the purchase of other
supplies used by Aguirre and his de
pendants. Rake said^he was informed
that triplicate copies of each bill had to
be made so that one could be retained
at the prison and two sent to Sacra
mento. As a matter of fact only
one bill is sent ' to Sacramen
to. Why Commissary Foley should
demand three copies when only two
were necessary is a mystery that could
not be explained by Rake.
Rake was greatly surprised when he
was show : n photographs of the forged
bills. One' of these bills was dated Sep
tember 1, 1901, and made out for the
following items: One ham at 52 48, two
rolls of butter at 80 cents, six dozen
eggs at 20 cents a dozen, 4 dozen eggs
at 20 cents a dozen, one box of pears at
$1, one box of apples at $1 25 and one
box of peaches at $1. After carefully
examining this bill Rake said that with
the exception of the date line all the
rest of the bill was written by some one
who was not in his employ. The writ
ing on the forged bills of this firm was
done by prisoners.
The writing on this bill, however. Is
not the only portion of it to excite sus
picion. The upper part of the bill, or
the head on which Rake said the date
line was in the handwriting of his
bookkeeper, has been torn from another
bill and affixed and pasted on a piece
of paper on which were written the
items above given.
The second photograph of a bill which
was presented to Mr. Rake for his in
spection was for reventy dozen eggs
at IS cents a dozen and two dozen
Plymouth Rock roosters at $7 75 per
dozen. As in the case of the first bill,
Rake also declared this bill was writ
ten by some one outside of the firm,
Â¦with the exception of the date line,
"March 25. 1902." He was certain In his
assertion that it had never been draft
ed by any one" in his employ and-posi
tive that he had not drafted it himself.
GAVE FOLEY BLANK BILLS.
When asked if he ever allowed any
of his billheads which were not filled
out to be. given to the San Quentin
prison commissary' department, ha
said: "Yes. In order to save my book
keeper's time I instructed him to give
them a number of empty billheads.
You see they wanted triplicate copies
and I thought they could make them
out as well as my bookkeeper."
In the case of the bill from Burtchaell
& Co. the crooked work is even more
perceptible than in the case of Gro3
jean's bills. Burtchaell & Co.'s bill m
the first instance as made out by
Burtchaell, proprietor of the store, was
fcr the purchase of thirty dozen eggs at
40 certs a dozen, a total of $12. After
the bill passed into the hands
of prison officials it was changed.
Three . more "items were adilod
to \ it, ' making the total $15 30.
When T. Finlayson, who is Burtchaell
& Co.'s chief clerk, saw the photograph
of the bill yesterday he immediately
declared that the last three items had
been added to it after the bill had been
made out by Mr. Burtchaell. The date
line and the item for. the thirty dozen
of eggs, which were in Burtchaell's
hand, were written in rather larg-j
firm characters, while the three items
which- were subsequently inserted were
pasting together of sheets of paper was
done in San Quentin prison. The photo
graph "of the bill shows where the lower
portion was pasted together.
â¢written very lightly and rather closely
together and in a hand that is very sel
dom employed by a business roan. Tho
forged bill was also the work of prison
ers at San Quentin.
Finlayson stated that Commissary
Foley had also requested Burtchaell <<&
Co. to give a number of blank billheads,
but that the request had been refused*
both by himself and Mr. Burtchaeil.
Notwithstanding the refusal and the
fact that no blank billheads were ever
given to the prison commissary depart
ment, Finlayson said that on one oc
casion one of the men employed In that
department showed up at the stora
with one of the firm's billheads all
filled out. Finlayson said that he was
unable to say where the billhead In
question had been obtained. As in tha
case- of Grosjean & Co. Commissary
Foley had always demanded that tha
bills be made out in three copies al
though but two were necessary.
CAN AGUIRRE EXPLAIN? .
It will be difficult for "Warden Aguirra
and other officials of San Quentin
prison to explain why bills purporting
to be from the well Jxnown firm, H. S.
Crocker Company, have been forged by
unfortunate prisoners acting on direc
tions, certified to by Aguirre and Foley
and foisted on the Board of Prison Di
rectors and the Board of Examiners
and duly paid.
.Inquiry made at the offices of the II.
S. Crocker Company elicited the infor
mation that in no instance were any
of their bill3 to customers written In
ink but were always typewritten.
The Call to-day reproduces photo
graphs of. two bills which are on file
at Sacramento, the contents of which
were filled in by prisoners at San Quen
tin on blank bills of H. S. Crocker Com
pany. \ .
The information waa given at the of
fices of the firm that Commissary Foley
had often asked for corrected bills, and
when told that it would take some
time to make them out, the San Quen
tin official would say that he had but
a few minutes to catch a boat at the
ferry and requested that he be given
blank bills and statements, In order
.that he might .flJI_ them out himself.
Thi3 shows another instance of how
bills have been forged at San Quentin
on billheads of prominent firms of this
city. ;
The deliberate juggling of the books
and records of San Quentin prison will
make it a very difficult task to unravel
the fraud, forgery and theft that have
been carried on by members of the cor
rupt ring that. controls that institution.
It is the duty of an impartial investi
gating body to spare no expense In
cleansing the Augean stables of ths
foul mass of corruption and criminality
that has grown* up as the result of Gov
ernor Henry T. Gage placing his bosom
friend, Martin G. Aguirre, in control of
the affairs of San Quentin prison. The
people demand a thorough investigation
of affairs and the swift punishment of
the guilty parties, no matter what posi
tion they may occupy.
Blank Bill=Forms Are First
Secured by Trickery From
Mercantile Organizations
DEMAND FAIR INQUIRY.
President It. M. Fitzgerald of the
Board of Prison Directors has stateG
that no investigation can be held by ihe
board until every member is able to be
present. The board consists of Gov
ernor Gage, ex-officio a. member, R. M.
Fitzgerald, president- J. H. Wiikins, li..
T. Devlin, Don Ray and Warren Portor.
If the Board of Prison Directors holds
the investigation, it must do so in a
thorough!> - impartial manner. If any
member of the b<>ard, during his term
of office, has received as a present or
purchased any article made in San
Quentin prison by prisoner labor other
than jute bags authorized by law, he is
disqualified from sitting on the investi
gating board and the investigation
must therefore be held by other State
officials. President Fltzgexald says an
investigation can only be held in the
presence of all the members of the
board.
The State Board of Examiners may
be also disqualified from holding an in
vestigation of the affairs of San Quen
tin prison. This official body and the
Board of Prison Directors have had
iarge numbers of forged bills presented
to them and they have been duly pass
ed for payment. The Board of Exam
iners consists of Governor Gage, the
Attorney General and the Secretary of
State.
When the Governor is absent, the
â¢ecretary of the board, Dan Kevane,
votes for the Governor. . - . . . â¢
Gross carelessness could alone permit
the foisting of forged bills upon tluj
Prison Directors and the Board of Ex
aminers. The people of the State, of
California are ' entitled to a
impartial body of investigators in .the
matter of the San Qiientia prison
frauds.
Justice demands that when the ver*
diet is rendered it should say whether
the prison Board of Directors and th2
Board of Examiners are to blame for
allowing forged bills to be foisted upon
them. Th? Board of Directors arid the
Beard of Examiners cannot sit in judg
ment upon themselves.
CANNOT JUDGE THEMSELVES.
Justice demands that the investigat
ing body should possess judicial power
and be absolutely impartial. The in
vestigating body should be able J.o
â¢ubpena witnesses? administer oaths
and compel the production of the books
of firms that have sold supplies to San
Quentin prisorL
Jr. the course of its Investigations Tho
Call has discovered a mass of evidence
of fraud, fcrgory and theft at San
QueniSn prison that would require
many v. ceks to publish in detail.
To-day this paper presents further
positive proof of its charges that thrÂ»
corrupt rills' In control of iian Quenihi
prison has Corced prisoners to forge billi
and accounts: books and public rccortls
have been falsified and altered; luxur
ies have been obtained by members of
â¢ the ring, and payir.er.t has been made
with pubiic funds secured by felony.
Â¦ Bills at:d aecouius prepnrrd by prison
ers have bc-en passerby the Board of
Prison Director*, the J3oard. of Exam
iners and the State Controller. These
bills have beer, duly certified to by
Commissary Francis Fo'ey and War
den Mfertin G. Aguirre.
The cunning hands of r>riEoners were
utilized to do the crooked work for th^
members of the corrupt ring that con
trols San Qucntin prison. Bill-head.s
have beÂ«n cut from genuine bills of
business houses and pasted by prisoners
to blank paper in order to prepare
forged substitute bills and thus Fecurc
psyment by the State for unauthorized
'supplies. These supplies of every vari
ety, from tabip deJicacira a:id snowy'
narcry to silk underwear and ladies'
rightgowiiP, have been obtained by
fraud arid forgery, not for the usr of
prisocers but for the: benefit of Warden
M. C Aguirre and his band o* cronies
and bosom friends.
MANY CRIMES COMMITTED.
The people of the State of California
have tx-en ciiitated in order that thv!
members of thf San Â«^uÂ«ntin prison
ring and their friends might \<;)l in lux
ury and drf'ss in stolen finery. To cover
up crimes, other crimes have been com
mitted. The supplies huvc been charged
'Â¦-Â¦'Â¦Â¦ J - ':-. '
Quentin prison has revealed;
a gigantic mass of fraud, forgery and
tXeft by State officials.
The Call has demonstrated that pris
oners sentenced to punishment at San
Quentin prison, have been forced by
Iheir official guardians to falsify public
records and substitute rorged bills, in
order that Warden Martin G, Aguirr.:-,
the favorite and bosom friend of Gover
nor Henry T. Gage, and others of
Aguirre's malodorous band, might se
cure public funds by felony in order
to pay for unauthorized supplies for
themselves and their mtimate friends.
To-day The Call presents more proof
of tne criminal acts of the, ring that
controls San Quentin prison. The evi
dence secured by this paper discloses
the fact that systematic fraud, forgery
and theft of public supplies have been
carried on by the men in control of San
Quentin prison.
The vast amount of incriminating
data secured by The Call is but an iota
compared to what can be uncovered by
an official investigation by duiy author
ized State officials. When this official
investigation is held, as it should be,
the revelations will astound the people
of the State of California.
Â¦ .. ,. URTHER invcrtigation by
tig The Call of the criminal
jjj J acts of the corrupt ring that
S , controls the financial affairs
-Â«. and administration of San
FOLEY WAS HURRIED.
Meyerfeld could not explain how
blank bills of his firm had come into
the possession of officials and prisoners
at San Quentin prison, but the cashier
of the firm was able to give the infor
mation. He told how Commissary
Folcy had often visited the offices of
the firm arid .asked" for monthly
statement k. When he would say h3
only had a few minute^ to catch
his boat at the ferry depot', and the
clerks would reply that they did not
have time to inake out the bills, Foley
would akli. for the blank bills and say
he would fill them out liimself.
Mr. Meycrfeld stated yesterday that
his clerks were fully conversant with
the â¢contract" and "non-contract"
goods fiold to San Quentin prison and
the articles were always separately
billed. -'Â¦"'.
A bill of Lebenbaum & Co. dated
February 28. 1902, for $S1 91 shows that
it was filled, In by the prisoner who
prepared the forged Lev! Strauss it
Co.'s bills, that are reproduced to-day
by The Call. . This bill :s certified' to
as being corrert by Commissary Foley
ur.d Warden Aguirre.
Another bi'l purporting to be from
Lebenbaum t'z Co." is dated March SI,
1001. It is for the. sum of $18 G5. The
bill-head was out off a. genuine bill of
the firm and was pasted by a prisoner
to a, sheet of ruled paper. An inspec
tion of the r photograph Knows the
right hand corner, of fhe lower part of
the bill-head to be loose, clearly dis
closing the work, of the prisoner who
pasted the bill together. The' bottom
, part of this bill chows that still further
"We always send the original bill and
a duplicate of it." ,
The 'dui'!icate bill is kept at San
Quentjn prison while the original is
sent to Sacramento, after being certi
fied to.
Whep Mr. Meyerfeld was asked if his
firm ever gave any of its blank bills
to customeYs. he answered:
"We would on no account ever give
our- blank bills to any one. It would
open the door to fraud.:'
When Mr. Meyerfeld/saw the photo
graphs of the forged bills he at once
declared that they were not written by
any of the clerks in the employ of his
firm. In one case where a bill-head had
been cut from a genuine bill of the firm
and pasted to a blank sheet of paper
by a prisoner who then prepared the
forged document, Meyerfeld at once
recognized the handwriting of one of
his clerks in the date line and the
words "Cala. Â¦ State Prison, San Quen
tin."
OBTAINED BLANK BILLS.
Inquiries made of L. Lebenbaum &
Co.. II. S. Crocker Company and
Urosjean & Co. show that Com
missary Fbley: had secured blank
bills by stating to clerks that the firms
had made an error in charging "con
tract" and "non-contract" supplies on
one bill, or that he desired a monthly
statement. Foley was always pressed
for time and would state that he had
only a few minutes to catch his boat
at the ferry depot. When the clerks
would inform Folcy that they did not
"have the tihfc to make out the cor
rected Kill or statement the San Quen
tin official would ask for th 3 blank bills
and sav 4hat. he would. have prepared
the desired bills. ' . . . :
Bills of L. Lebenbaum & Co. and
other^firms are reproduced in The. Call
to-day as samples of the forgeries on
filer, at Sacramento. They have been
.shown to members of the firms men
tioned and have been declared to be
forged. To take all the bills on file at
Sacrame"hto, purporting to be for prison
supplies furnished by Lebenbaum &
Go. and other firms and compare them
with the books of the business houses,
would take a vast amount of time.
Jesse Meycrfeld of the firm of Leben
baum & Co. was shown photographs of
some of the forged bills of hte firm that
were certified to as being correct by
Commissary Feley and "Warden Aguirra
and foisted on State officials for pay
ment.; â¢ ;
Mr. Meyerfeld was asked what was
the custom of his firm in making out
bills for goods supplied to San Quentin
prison and replied:
to various prison accounts and. by di
rection of their guardians, the unfortu
nate prisoners have been forced to fur
ther jeopardize their souls.
A fw days ago The Call presented
in close detail the evidence showing
how goods had been obtained by tl:a
ring at San Quentin trom L-evi Strauss
& Co.- and forced bills substituted
and foisted on the Prison Directors
and Board of Examiners for payment.
The forged bills of I,evi Strauss &
Co. are reproduced to-e:ay In The Call
in order that the public may judge and
compare the-Avriting of the prisoner Who
filled them out with a number of bills
purporting to be troni well-known
business houses, that are also printei
herewith.
The hand of the prisoner
who Avas directed by his official
guardians to forge the bills on Le^'i
Strauss & Co's bill-heads, cut from gen
uine bills, has been used by his jailors
to forge other documents purporting to
be from L. Lebenbaum & Co., H. S.
decker Company, C; Grosjean & Co.
of San Rafael, and Burtchaell & Co.
of the same city.
In some cases bill-heads have been
cut from genuine bills and used for the
purpose of preparing the forged docu

So it easily happens that the com

for four quires of manila paper, two
dozen eggs and. two rolls of butter a3
they did oh the 31st of last March,
while awaiting instructions as to what
account they shall place the excess
that ought to* be charged against the
two sets of sheets, ostensibly recording
the same sets of transactions, might
easily be supposed to correspond. So
they would if they were honest records.
But on what are known as the "first
segregation sheets," the actual amounts
of money that the commissary finds it
necessary to charge up to some account
are Included. Toward the bottom of
the first sheets, if any yet remain un
destroyed, the Items of expenditure will
be found to be very large. At the bot
tom of the sheets they can easily be
erased and the apportionment of the
items in the monthly accounts can be
then readily made in such way as to
shield the Warden and make it appear
that his expenditures are within the
legal limit. The subterfuge Is to
charge up the many articles drawn for
the Warden's subsistence to other ac
counts, the prisoners' mess being a con
venient place to enter them. .
On one occasion the refusal to per
mit an inspection of the - books waa
made by Acting Warden J.' A. Aguirre
and on the other by the Warden him
self. On the first occasion, the Warden
being in Los Angeles, Acting Warden
j. A. Aguirre sent a telegram to his
brother, but he did- not obtain any au
thorization to make the exhibition. On'
the second^^eccasion' the ; refusal was
made by Warden Aguirre personally.
On two separate occasions the repre
sentatives of The Call were refused an
opportunity to see the wharf shipping
book which may have told where the
furniture went to. Some of it came to
San Francisco and was rebilled in this
city so that the convicts could not
know any too much about its des
tination.

dled the furniture in any of the stages
between' the time that the materials
first entered the prison until the furni
ture was turned out and ready to ship
out of the prison *but knew that here
was a persistent violation of law. The
convicts who knew of the shipping of
the furniture from the wharf at San
Quentdi saw a step farther than those
on the inside of the prison and they
must have been surprised when they
saw and learned who were the bene
ficiaries of the illegal manufacturing.
Apart from the consideration of the
illegality of the whole performance con
nected with the furniture, was the con
sideration of the fact that the criminals
who were sent to San Quentin to be
reformed, as well as punished, were re
ceiving lessons in crime at that partic
ular place. Not one of those who han-
Immediately after th.e first visit of
the representatives of The Callthe hid
ing of furniture at San Quentin began.
Out of the' way places were filled with
It and convicts looked on with aston
ishment at the evident dismay that in
fluenced the counsels of those whom
the act of Governor Gage has placed
over them as custodian of themselves
and of the property and interests -at
San Quentin of the State.
There were, however, in the prison
that day in process of manufac
ture covers for inlaid tables, one
rosewood carved bedstead, one carved
sideboard, ten large arm chairs, twelve
fancy carved chairs, two dressing cases,
one desk, one bookcase, six chairs not
previously enumerated, one dressing
case and one table. Some of these ar
ticles were for the use of Acting War
den J. A. Aguirre. Some of them .were
for Mr. McClure of Los Angeles, who
is a friend of Warden Aguirre. ThÂ«j
facts concerning these, articles have
previously been mentioned in detail.
Acting Warden J. A. Aguirre told
the representatives of The Call who
were inquiring Intb the management of
the San Quentin prison that there
might be a few chairs that infirm pris
oners were working, on, but that was
all at that tlmejn the prison.
To carry on the business of manu
facturing at the State prison at San
Quentin it has been necessary, for the
shielding of those engaged in the en
terprise, to falsify the records, for the
labor' of convicts In that direction is
prohibited by the law of the State.
None are in better position to know
that the entire proceedings in this mat
ter are illegal than are the well known
citizens of the State who have -been
beneficiaries of the acts of Warden
Aguirre. Furniture has been shipped
from San Quentin to Los Angeles and
San Francisco, San Diego and other
points.
San Quentin, referred to the furniture.
Mr. Aguirre refused to permit the fur
niture to be seen. Subsequently a de
mand to see the wharf shipping book,
which might have told something about
where the furniture that has been
shipped from San Quentin has gone
to, was denied. It Is not difficult to
trace the furniture by other methods
than inspection of the books at the
wharf at San Quentin.
In other words, to simplify the mat
ter, the statement can be made In this
way. The actual expenditures for the
supplies sent to the Warden's house on
the 27th, 28th and 31st days of March,
1902, as shown by the first and reliable
segregation sheet, amounted to $182 S3.
But the only items that were charged
up against the Warden for the three
On the 27th of March last they
charged up against the Warden on the
dally requisition book only ten pounds
of beef, five dozen eggs, two rolls of
butter, six bottles of Worcestershire
sauce, six bottles of tomato sauce, five
pounds pudding sugar, two rolls
table butter, while on the first
segregation sheet is the item,
awaiting the transfer to some other ac
count, but undoubtedly representing
the amount that ought to havel been
charged agralnst the Warden's subsist-,
ence, of $51 61.
it appear In one place that the Warden
had on that day only five dozen eggs,
one sack of flour, 'twelve cakes of
Sapolio, one roll of butter, three bottles
of mushrooms, one bottle of sweet
pickles and four dozen eggs; in another
place made the charge against tho
Warden's house, in the first segregation
sheet, $65 87 for the day. '*.Â¥, '*â¢ V
VIOLATION OF THE LAW.
For months the employment of pris
oners in the manufacture of furniture
in the sash and blind building of the
prison has been unceasing. Many ar
ticles of furniture have been turned
out and shipped away from San Quen
tin, all in .violation of the law. Th<i
material for making of the furniture
has been charged up to the other ac
counts on the San Quentin books so
cleverly that it will be difficult to find
the items, although that may be done.
The first request that was made of
Acting Warden J. A. Aguirre for infor
mation by the representatives of The
Call, on the first day of their visit to
and distribution of convict
made furniture from San Quentin
prison. One costly article of furniture
that was given by Warden Aguirre to
a friend in San Francisco has already
been pictured in The Call from a photo
graph. For the wood that was used In
the construction of the article, a hand
somely carved mahogany bedstead.
Warden Aguirre received $45, which
may or may not have been credited to
the prison.

It should be explained, as a guide to
the .bookkeeping of, the prison, that
there are .two sets of "segregation
sheets," so called, that are used by the
commissary's clerks before the' figures
are finally placed in the ledger to sum
marize the transactions of a month. The
therein contained are com
pared with other writings that
form a part of the absurd system of
bookkeeping pursued by the commis
sary department at San Quentin under
the authority of Warden Aguirre. For
instance, taking.the month 'of MarcH,
,1902, as an example, the day requisition
book contains no entries for supplies
charged up against the house of the
Warden for subsistence on the thirty
first day except four quires of manila
paper, two dozen eggs and two rolls of
butter. That is all that was^ntered
for that day, when the figures were
carefully copied from the book by two
representatives of The Call. Neverthe
less, the amount charged up by the
commissary on the "first segregation
sheet" for that day, under the item of
"subsistence for the "Warden's house,"
is $65.40.

tor of the Phebe Hearst archaeological ex
pedition in Egypt for the benefit of the
University of California, of the discovery
of a great quantity of valuable material
in the tombs of Glrga, on the river Nile.
This will be immediately forwarded to
swell the specimens in the museum of
anthropology at Berkeley, which is an im
portant adjunct to the new department of
archaeology and anthropology recently es
tablished by an endowment of, Mrs.
Hearst. . \ : Â¦"Â¦ Â¦ \ "
When the new department was institut
ed, two years ago, experts in archaeology
from me Smithsonian Institution and va
rious Eastern universities were sent to
Mexico, Peru and Egypt at Mrs. Hearst's
expense to collect material for 'the muse-'
urn, which was to be instituted as a
branch of the new course of study. The
Egyptian scientists, under the direction
of Dr. Relsner, have been working for
two years, in the Nile Valley with remark
able results. : - â¢ \ Â¦Â¦
According to Dr. Reisner's recent report,
his most important find was a collection
of statuettes, grouped about the coffin of
a mummy, which represented the house
hold of the deceased. Surrounding a
wooden efligy of the master were the fig
ures of servants, represented as making
bricks, carrying water, cooking and keep
ing flies off the food. AIL of the images
were excellently modeled and brightly
colored by pigments, though their age an
tedated the time of Moges,
Another Interesting discovery was that
that made in the tomb of a lady. On top
of her sarcophagus was found a toilet
case, containing alabaster paint boxes,

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. May 31.
Seldom has Ebell witnessed a more
pleasing sight* than that presented by
Miss Mabel T. Gray and Miss Mary Cul
bertson, as the dark-haired young presi
dent introduced the visitor, who, twenty
flve years ago, was the first occupant
of the presidential chair of the society.
Miss Culbertson's appearance was the
signal for hearty applause, to which she
Â¦responded with a witty and gracious
speech. )
The' reception to-day was the regular
Saturday, monthly affair, but was unusu
ally interesting and enjoyable from the
fact that not .only was Miss Culbertson
a loved and honored guest on this occa
sion, but among the other distinguished
guests were Mrs. Frederick Nathan, of
the National Consumers' League, Mrs.
Robert Burdette, flrst vice president of
the General Federation, and Mrs. Granger
of Georgia, president of her home State
federation. After a short and pleasing
musicaLjH-ogramme these ladies each gave
a shortaddress, and it is seiaom that the
women of Ebell have the privilege of lis
tening to three such brilliant talkers In
one afternoon.
Mrs. Burdette was the first to speak,
and in a short, earnest address explained
why all clubs should enter the federation.
Woman's clubs, she said, had long passed
the hour when they might be called
"fads"â that organized womanhood stands
for the care of the future citizenâ that it
should be the aim of every clubwoman
to help her organization to "become a
blessing to the women, the children, the
home and the state." '
Mrs. Nathan was next introduced. She
is a handsome woman, with a strong re
semblance to Maxine Elliott, and Is a
fluent talker. In the course of her re
marks concerning the Consumers' League
she made several statements of particu
lar interest to Californians, one being
that "Western women are the largest pur
chasers of sweatshop manufacturers, and
that it would be almost impossible to
abolish sweatshops without the co-opera
tion of the women of the West.-
Mrs. Granger spoke at some length of
the educational work accomplished by the
State Federation of Georgia, and how
they are trying to do away with child
labor in the cotton mills there, where it
is a common sight to see tots only 6 years
of age working not only in the daytime,
but on the "night shifts."
Mrs. Giles H. Gray was hostess for the
1 day. and was assisted in receiving by the
president, Mis3 Mabel T. Gray, the char
ter members and the ex-presidents. A
piano duet was played by the Misses Ha
gar. Miss Edith Hibberd sang "April'
and I," by "Walphen, and in response to
ah encore sang "Sunrise." -by Metcalf.
"How Rubinstein Played" was, amusingly
read by Miss Faith Sturtevant. An "Im
promptu." by Schubert, was rendered by
Miss Kendall.
A pretty feature of the afternoon was
the presentation to the guest of -honor.

street, for the next ten days.
ALAMEDA, May 31.â Faithful even
after death were the dog companions of
Mrs. Dorothea" Paupitz-Olson, an aged
and odd character of the West End, who
was discovered dead in her lonely home
yesterday. One canine had to be killed
before Undertaker James Fowler and hi3
assistants could enter the house of the
deceased. Another was found on the bed
with the cold body of its mistress. The
brute resented the intrusion of the stran
gers with snarls and savage snapping, it
required three men to drive the canine
guard out of the death chamber.
Mrs. Paupitz, or Olson, as ahe was gen
erally known, was 75 years of age, and
for many years had lived in strange se
clusion in the place that she owned on,
Santa Clara avenue, near Fifth street.
Dogs were her closest friends, and she
kept many of them constantly with her.
She expended more in providing for the
animals than she did in purchasing food
and clothing for herself. The canines
were allowed the freedom of her domicile
and were not permitted to leave the
premises. When one of the dogrs was sick.
Mrs. Olson nursed the animal as if it
were a human being. She often remarked
that she cared more for a kind dog than
she did for her second husband, Thomas
Olson, a sailor of 25, whom she married
when she was 70. She obtained a divorce
from Olson, was married to him a second
time and again had the marital ties sev
ered. According to neighbors, Olson called
on the aged woman a few days before
her demise and tried to persuade her to
once more become his wife.- She refused
him, and Olson has not been seen here
since. It }s said that it was the property
of the old woman and not herself that
moved the sailor to propose to her that
she become his spouse for the third time.-
Public Administrator E. C. Hawes has
taken charge of the decedent's estate.
Her body lies at the local branch Morgue.
No incuest will be held in the case, as
the woman had been treated by a physi
cian for a severe cold, which developed
into pneumonia and caused her death
Nine months ago Mrs. Olson's degs for
ten days prevented Constable George E.
Clarke from gaining admittance to their
owner's house and serving a warrzrnt upon
her for disturbing the peace of the neigh
borhood. The Constable finally served the
paper with the aid of the poundman

of The Call were permitted to se?.
Probably no more cf such sheets will

OAKLAND. May SLâ There has been
much activity in the Fifth Regiment of
the National Guard, the major portion of
which is located in Alameda County, in
tne last few weeks. Three of the companies
of thr Fifth Regiment ln this county
have held elections and two of the three
companies have new commanders, while
the remaining one has a new set of lieu
tenants.
Company A, which is the oldest company
ol the regiment, has re-elected Captain
Edward Hunt as captain. First Lieuten
ant John Ellis resigned and Second Lieu
tenant Fred VT. Petersen was elected m
Ws place. Corporal C. Poulter being made
second 1 eutenam. Lieutenant Petersen
is verv popular and has been one ot tne
most active members of the company
Corporal Poulter is a son of Â£f a JÂ° r
Poulter of the Fifth Regiment. Major
Poulter was for mauy years commander
l cSS?G of Alameda has recently re
organized. Edward R. McDonald deleat
ed George II. Wetheren fÂ° r , the w r^ri"n
captain by one vote. Captain Wetheren
having held the position for one term.
Both of the contestants are well known
in National Guard circles. Captain
Wetheren is a resident of East OaK and
and has been at the head of Oakland
companies and has been on the statt or
the Fifth Regiment. It was the fact of
his not being a resident of Alameda that
largely contributed to his defeat. Cap
tain McDonald belongs to a pioneer fam
ilv of Bay Farm Island and was born in
Alameda thirty years ago. V% hen Com
pany G was organized in Alameda he en
listed as a private. On June 8, 189d. he
was made corporal, and was promoted to
sergeant on April 30, 1S9& When Com
panv G was mustered into the Eighth
Regiment of California Volunteers dur
ing the Spani.-h war he became second
lieutenant of the company and saw serv
ice at Vancouver Barracks, to which
place his company was ordered.
Company I of Liverniore has also re
organized during the last week. Reor
ganization in this company was made
necessary by Captain C. M- be
ing appointed chaplain of the Fifth Regi
ment with his old rank of captain. The
election was held in Livermore under the
8u=pic<*s of Captain Wetheren, and Sec
ond Lieutenant J. O. McKown was
elected captain and Sergeant M. Schoen
fold was elected second lieutenant. First
Lieutenant Hunter retains his rank.
Company I of Livermore has been
unique in that it has had at its head a
minister of the Gospel. The company
was organized some years ago ana at
tached to the Fifth Regiment. Rev. C.
M Warner, then a recent graduate and
the pastor of a Livermore church, was
elected the first captain, and he has
held that position until he resigned to
become chaplain of the Fifth Regiment
with the game rank. The old captain
was most successful in his management
of the company, and it is expected that
the new captain will do as well. Cap
tain McKown is one of the leading busi
ness men of Livermore, and has served
many terms in the Town Council and as
Postmaster. He was but recently elected
second lieutenant of the company and
now becomes captain.
MONTHLY EXPENDITURES
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 3L
Auditor A. II. Breed to-day refused to
sign another batch of bills of the Contra
Costa Water Company and returned thera
to the Board of Public Works with the
statement that he believed them to bo
illegal and that it was in the power of
the board to declare them so. The Au
ditor gave seven reasons why he con
sidered the bills to be illegal and then
passed them back up to the Board 1 of
Public Works lor further action. . The
bills included in this batch consist of the
water bills for street sprinkling and for
pr.rk and sewer flushing since January 1
of the present year.
With the b|lls returned to-day there are
now some $80,000 worth of water bills that
are held by the Auditor and which cannot
be paid until there is some decision from
the Supreme Court upon the stand that
he has taken.
Mr. Breed takes the general stand that
the payment of any water bills by the
city of Oakland during the pending litiga
tion would be prejudicial to the interests
of the city. He then gives seven reasons
for his refusal to allow the claims.
The first reason is one that he has ad
vanced before in his rejection dt other
claimsâ that the Contra Costa Water Com
pany collected water rates last year when
there was no water rate ordinance in
force and that this act worked a forfeit
ure of the franchise and works of the
company to the city. ' â¢
CEAKGES DISCRIMINATION.
The second reason is that the Contra
Costa Water Company has discriminated
in the collection of water rates and in
this connection the Auditor makes this
statement:
It is notorious, however, that the water com
pany since last July has not charged the rates
fixed by the Council, but has been guilty of
discrimination between consumers. From many
consumers the water company has collected the
full rate, but has discounted the established
rate in various degrees to the favored consum
ers. Thus the equality and uniformity of the
rates contemplated by the constitution have
been destroyed. The Contra Costa Water Com
pany has thus violated the mandate of the con
stitution prohibiting it from collecting rates
other than those established by the Council and
has thereby forfeited Us franchises and water
works to the city of Oakland.
The' third reason is that the water rate
ordinance recently adopted fixes max
imum, but not minimum rates, and is
therefore void. The fourth is that there
is no contract in writing between the com
pany and the city. The fifth is that the
Contra Costa Water Company has not
paid its license to the city. The sixth is
that the company has not filed a quarterly
statement of its receipts, as required by
law. ' â¢â¢
OWES CITY LICENSE MONEY.
The seventh is that the companv owes
the city several thousand dollars license
money. The Auditor says in regard to
this: . ' '
The Contra Costa Water Company from Hay
20, 18S7, the date of thp approval of the said
licensing ordinance, until September. 1806,
never paid a cent as license money. The records
show it should have paid $100 for each and
every quarter of that period. From September.
1S05. to July 1. 1901. the water company has
paid but ?60 for each quarter of that period.
The records also show that it should have paid
$1CO for each quarter. Since March 31. 1902,
the water company has not paid a cent for
license. The company Is now indebted to the
<-ity for back licenses in the principal sum of
$4220. which, with interest, aggregates $6830.
If these demands were otherwise legal,, the
amount of this indebtedness should be deducted
therefrom before allowing them. â¢ â¢ â¢ it
is competent for your honorable body to deduct
thic indebtedness to the city for back licenses
and thereby protect the city's rights. You
Fhould consider the claims reduced by the
amount of said indebtedness.
pared â¢with the original entry on the
commissary's books for March, 1902.
The sums in each "instance are the
same. Since the method of bookkeep
ing was discovered by the represent
atives of The Call the entries on the
books have been changed to make the
defense of the Warden better in a pos
sible investigation.
.All sorts of supplies for the Warden's
table have been sent to the Warden's
house from the commissary department
and are charged up to cement side
walks, prisoners' mess or to any other
item that seemed likely to form an im
penetrable shield against investigation.
ALTERATIONS IN BOOKS.
The alterations in the books are not
made for innocent purposes. They
cover transactions that are in violation
of law. In the case of the Warden's
subsistence account they serve to con
ceal the fact that the supplies sent
monthly to the Warden's house exceed
by hundreds of dollars in value the
amount which the law permits to be
expended monthly for the Warden's
subsistence.

Customs Inspector John Peppin yesterday un
earthed on the America Maru a rich horde of
contraband eoods. the property of L. E. Be-
BiiES, the white purser on the Japanese liner.
Some of the goods were discovered In the mall
room, the balance in Bemiss' trunk. The pur
eer confessed to the ownership and Inspector
Peppin took charre of the goods, which iu
variety and quality pay mute tribute to the
rhrewdnets of the purser's trading instinct.
The seizure is considered important' for the
reason that it is unusual for the purser of a
bic passenper liner to be implicated in any
thinr savoring- of sniUBSlinp. Peppin is proud
of the seizure, which he has listed as follows:
One silk handkerchief case, one cloisonne vase,
twelve silk doylies, one silk center piece, one
Ivory p^r^r cutter, one silk pin cushion, 525
cigars and two bolts of cilk. The fllk was
found In Bem!?s' trunk. A tabourette was
a!*o seized, but of this the purser disclaims
cwnershln.
Purser's Goods Seized.

$173,000 from stockholders of the White
Swan mine and that of this sum he had
expended $17,000 on advertising and $15,000
on postage; aiso that the total output ht
all mines operated by him was but $b31,
all of which was secured from the Gold
Kidge mine and not from the White Swan,
and that he had expended 15700 on it.
A letter was introduced in evidence
written by Balliet /from Des Moines to
W. B. Barstow of 'Manila, Iowa, appris
ing him that he was conducting a sub
scription contest for the Mining News
and requesting him to copy a list of
names that Balliet inclosed with his let
ter, so as to obtain the prize, after which
j the prize could be returned to Balliet.
, This subscription list was to be submitted
to the Government, obtaining accesi-5 to
the mails as second class matter for the

The official statement of May 24 showed
about $2,000,000 less cash than that estimated

largely reflecting syndicate operations. Ther*

â¢The termination ot James A. Patten's sue
cessiul corner in May oats brought a pictur
esque close to the business of the week and
the month. For several months the May detij
has dominated the oats pit to the exclusion
of any very active business In other futures.
Exceptionally clever manipulation by Mr- Pat
ten secured for him a line of lonsr stuff at !
about 37c, amounting to between 10,000.000 and |
12.000,000 bushels. Prices were pushed method- j
ically from 'week to week on the corn scarcity i
and held at a high price until May 1. when!
Mr." Patten began buying the cash stuff and!
selling it out at a good advantage, but at a J
tempting figure. Local stocks were piactically ]
depleted â deliveries were taken by the shorts
who wanted to deliver, but" the price hardly]
wavered from its strong position. May shorts
settled personally with the big bull without
going into-.the pit. To-day Patten himself bid '
prices up. nobody dared sell what they would H
\ have to. buy from him and. the result was an j
advance to-day of 5%c over yesterday and a |
tightly cornered close at the top price on j
record tor May â iDU,c. Profits to the leader,
are estimated at a little short of $1,000,000.
The trade in other oats was dull and un- j
eventful. Crop prospects were good and with;
corn weakening oats sold off, July closing |

the strike of the packing-house teamsters at

OATS are the only firm grain in the market
at present, and tftey are' closely held in few
bands. Tho local demand is very fair and the
market continued in excellent shape for sellers.
The Chicago letter of Bolton, De Ruyter &.
Co. says :
"The liquidation of the remaining May con
tracts was the feature of interest. There was
evidently enough interest to make it an object
for holders to advance the price. The rest
Â«.f the market was duli and easier. Now that
the May is out of tha way the whsle market
will probably come back to a condition more
healthy. Crop advices continue favorable. The
failure of the premium for May to drag out
any considerable receipts is a pretty fair in
dication that stocks of old Oats are practically
exhausted."

CORN â Chicago declined again. Country
acceptances were light, but the market weak
ened on large receipts, liquidation and lack
of support. The Chicago letter of Bolton, De
Ruyter & Co. nald: "Market here was rather
heavy. Country offerings were again small,
but there was enough scattered liquidation to
ease the price. The Gates party were evidently
good buyers of- SeDtember Corn on the break.
We see no indications yet of any effort to
liquidate by the large holders."
Tills market continued dull and weak, with
holders inclined to give buyers concessions to
effect sales.

BARLEY â The spot market broke sharply,
owing to the heavy May deliveries already
mentioned.- All of the May contracts were
taken by the leading buyer, which throws a
lot of spot Barley on the market, and as the
new crop is on the eve of coming in pronounc
ed weakness is the result. Everybody is liq
uidating. Cash Feed sold at 92&@97%c, the
latter figure being paid for an exceptionally
fine lot and June was offered down to 90c.
The rain, too, helped the market down. .
There was not much doing in futures, as the
May deal is over; but the bears offered near
deliveries Â¦ low down .and with . great vigor.
There were no. bulls in sight.

was nothing in ttie weather, to strengthen . the
market, and with . spine weakness in coarse
grains, there was enough liquidation to carry
prices fractionally lower. Broomhall Â¦, says
Liverpool is affected somewhat by drouth in
Australia and that the market is unsettled by
uncertainty regarding the import duty on
wheat. Cash demand is slow. Speculative op
erations are at minimum and the wheat ouv
look seems dull. Some Increase in primary
movement is probable. On present conditions
we are Inclined to think wheat should be sold
on strong days." - ' .

WANTEDâ Board and room for lady's new hi
cycl. nit; divided. Box 511. Call ofnee! 'Every week brings news of the exten
sion of the facilities for working : the
mines of California by electric power.
Huge (Systems arc completed or in con
struction which will so far reduce the- cost
of mining as to materially improve the
chances for making low grade ores prof
itable. The latest electric power plant
applied directly to mining to bo complet
ed is that of the Manposa Mining and
Commercial Company, tho wires of which
extend from BayDy on the Merced River
to the company's mines at Mount Bullion
and Mariposa. A test with full voltage has
just been made and proved the line to be
satisfactory. -The Merced Star tells of
the changes that will follow the opera
tion of the power line as follows:
The capacity of the mills and the output of
the mines will be largt-iy increased, in conse
quence of the introduction cf electric power.
Heretofore power has been an expensive Kern.
The cost of cutting wood on the company's
own land and hauling it to the mills has
been $3 50 per cord. Hence, a great *avin?
will bo- made in cost of operating. .The 30
btamp mill at thÂ£ Princeton mine '(.Mount Bul
lion) will be increased to 50 stamps, and 10
stamps will be added t& the 20-stamp mill at
Mariposa. At the Princeton mine there are
now 300 men on the pay roil, and at the Mari
posa about 00. Jn- addition to these a. lar?e
number of other laborers are employed on thy
company's property. - The teams which have
been employed in hauling wood will be needed
for hauling out lumber, as the output of the
sawmills in the vicinity this season will W ap
proximately 300.1X10 feet. Th; Colorado-Mexico
Company has begun work on a big power piant
which will be installed on -tin? river at Brbad
iiecd. about five miles abov-j Bagby. A mas
sive stone and cement dam will be erected and
an immense power will be developed, evfen at
low stages of the water. We understand that
it is the intention of this company to sell
power. Their plans are on a large scale aiÂ»i
two years may be required to carry them out.
AMADOR IS ACTIVE.
The activity of the mining men of Araa
dor County is manifested strikingly. Ad
ditions are being- made to plants of large
size and properties are opening up lor
development that have been disused for
a time. Twenty additional stamps have
been started in the Central Eureka. A
ti-ew hoist will be put In at the Kennedy
mine at Jackson, and a largo mill will be
erected near the east shaft. After a while
the work of the mine will be done
through one shaft. The Kretcher
mine has been bonded to the Rhetta
consolidatd Mining Company for $10,000.
A twenty-stamp mill is being constructed
at the Mitchell mine near Pine Grove.
Foundations are being laid for a. new air
compressor at the Gover mine. The new
plant at Electra is supplying power to
Amador and Calaveras counties. Power
drills have been put in at tho Del Monte
mine near Railroad Flat.
A tract of eighty acres has been leased
to R. S. Grant to operate oh the Brasel- '
ton ranch, near Oroville. Th6 Cherokee
mine in Butto County is operating under
a lease.
The plans of the Stanislaus Water and
Power Company include the construction
of a water and power system to divert the
water of the middle fork of the Stanislaus
River, about twenty-five miles from So- {
nora, by flume and ditch, having a cap
acity of 15.000 inches and the generation of
21.000 horse power; also the carrying of
tOOO inches of water to the San Domingo
mine and other properties along the Cen
tral Hill and Cataract channels in Cal
averas County In the vicinity of Mur
phys, Douglas Flat, Vallecito and Angels.
' Hydraulicking at the Lancell mine at
Buckeye, Calaveras County, will begin as
soon as the ditches, flumes and pipes are
ready for operating. |The Calaveras group
of eleven claims between Murphys' and
Sheep Ranch has been, bought by J. D.
Olsen of San .Francisco. The Gwin mine
people have received assurances from the I
Southern Pacific Company that a branch
line will be run to their property. Dredg
ing for gold is going on in the Calaveras
River, near Jenny Lind. Ten stamps are
dropping: at the Giuffra mine near Mokel- Â¦
umne Hill, he Reliance mine near West
Point has started to operate with a-4
stamp mill. The Stanislaus Water and
Power Company has bought the water ;
rights formerly owned by G. Batten of j
Murphys for $25,000.
High grade ore is reported to have been
discovered in the bottom of the main
shaft of the Reward .mine near Bishop,
Inyo County. >v

WILL TURN OUT
Shriners Are â¢ Coming
From Every Part of
the Union.
An Official Badge Is Adopted
â¢ by Islam Tem
ple.
All the members of Islam Temple of the
Ancient Arabic Order of the Mystic
Shrine are .actively preparing for the
Siiiriners' week in this city, which will
open Monday, June 9, and close with the
midnight hour on the following Saturday.
It is expected from letters received at
the headquarters of Islam Temple that
not less than twenty-five out of. the
eighty-three temples in the United States
v ill be in this city. Among those that
have signified their Intention to make the
|iilÂ£-rimage to the far West are the follow
ine named temples:
Al Malaikah of Lob Angeles; Mecca of Xew
York; Damascus of Rochester. X. X.I Lu Lu of
Philadelphia: Al Koran of Cleveland, O. ;
Moolah of St. Louis, Mo.; Syria of Pittsburg,
I'a. : 7.* Ga Ztg of Des Moines. la.; Al Kader
cf Portland. Or.; El Jebel of Denver; El Zagal
of Kargo. N. D. ; Aleppo of Boston, Mass.; Mos
lem of Detroit, Mich.; Syrian of Cincinnati. O.,
and Medianah of Chicago. In addition to these
the following temples lrom the Northwest will
be represented: Algeria. Helena. Mont.; Afifi.
Tacoma. Wash.; El Katif, Spokane. Wash.: El
Korah. Boise City. Idaho; Kl Riad, Sioux City,
S. D.; Korein. Rawlings. Wyo.. and Naga,
Dead wood. S. D. These temples will have from
70 to 400 nobles each in this city.
STRENGTH OF SKRINEBS.
The strength of the Shriners in the
tnited States may be judged from the
membership of some of the largest tem
ples, such as Mecca of New York, which
has a membership of 4002: Aleppo of Bos
ton, 321G; Medianah of Chicago, 32S0; Lu
Lu of Philadelphia. 28S7; Syria of Pitts
burg, 194S; Moslem of Detroit, Ih44; Svrian
ot Cincinnati, 1137, and Islam of San Fran
cisco, V2S.
SPLEITDID DECORATIONS.
From Denver. Toledo. Pittsburgh De
troit, New York and Buffalo will come
Arab patrols to join with Islam's patrol
lxi the great day parade during the week.
Each patrol will be attired in full Ara
bian costume, similar to that worn by
zouaves, and these will make a pretty
and picturesque part of the procession,
that will be headed by the mounted pa
irol. Noble George K. Neal, who Is -to
command the mounted Arabs, wanted all
of them to be on camels, but after much
correspondence he ascertained that it was
impossible to obtain the number requisite,
and therefore, as one of his brother no
bles said, "he has decided to secure
horses and imagine that they are cam
els." It is estimated that in addition to
the patrol there will be enough nobles in
full dress suits and red fezes to have be
tween WOO and 6000 persons in the parade.
The decoration committee will have
Golden Gate asylum, in which the Impe
rial Council will hold its short business
cessions daily, decorated in Oriental
splendor, ami the Pavilion, where the
principal events are to take place, will be
made gay with flags, bunting and ail that
goes to make up an attractive feature.
The banquet that is to be given in the
Pavilion will be one of the largest ever
given in this city, being surpassed in
numbers only, so it is said, by the banquet
that was given in this city in 1S55 to cele
brate the capture of the Tour Malakoff
during the' Crimean War. At that time,
in a tent nt South Park, covers were laid
for 2500.
Another feature of decoration will be
the lighting of Market, part of Montgom
ery and part of Kcarny streets with
6trings of electric lights and the display
Cf Shriner flag^ and emblems.
The official bad?e issued by Islam Tem
ple is of aluminum bronze and has the
crescent and sclmetar and Egyptian head*
Pendant from the latter is a Shriner
astride of a grizzly bear with a noose
around its neck, and the Shriner is "hold
ing on to the rope." A new style of but
ton is one similar to the small gold one
vorn. but is also of aluminum bronze
and has added to it a small piece of metal
in the shape of a rope.
