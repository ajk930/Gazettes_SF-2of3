What I eaid made a distinction between two
classes of people â the first, the demagogues,
who did not believe what they were ' saying ;
the other, the class of people to which the se
nior Senu tor from Massachusetts belongs, who
did believe 'what they were saying; were per
fectly sincere, but were suffering from over
heated consciences â that la, they were too sin
cere. Instead of criticizing Senator Hoar, I in
tended to pay him a compliment on. being so
slftce're. j In regard to my leave of absence,
I made the application one evening, but "de
partment matters came up the next morning
that made It Impossible for me to leave here.
Therefore I telegraphed withdrawing my ap
plication made the night before, and before f.he
W*r Department had time to act upon It. Th*
banquet of the Middlesex Club In Boston is to
be glvpn April 20. I received within one week
ten telegramsâ three in one day â urging me to
attend. Senator Lodge was very anxious for
me^to come. As you understand I cannot dis
cuss any order I Jiave received or may receive.
So far I have received the order only through
the newspapers, not. officially. I had decided
to talk no further of the Philippine question.
I have nothing to retract, but I. can't refer to
these things without my blood boiling, and I
have, therefore, concluded that the safest pol
icy 16 to avoid the subject. I have had my say
and the people know my sentiments. I have no
desire to harp upon them.

EXPLAINED BY FUNSTON.
The President is determined to stop the
discussion of ' public questions by/ army
and navy officers, and' the reprimand ad
ministered to General Funston' was made
public both for the additional punishment
which publicity involves and to show of
ficers of the two services that they. must
keep within the bounds of propriety if
they desire to escape official rebuke.
A" copy of the letter was sent to eSn
ator Hoar, who. it Is understood, ex
pressed satisfaction with the action
taken and announced that he. was willing
to let the matter drop.

CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
TV.. WASHINGTON. April 23.-General
Chaffee is to have a free hand in dealing
Â¦with the warlike Moros in the island of
Mindanao. Though expected to exhaust
every resource of peaceful negotiation he
is to be allowed to carry on a war against
them If necessary to bring them to terms.
This in brief is the policy of the ad
ministration, as revealed by official cor-
respondence between the War Department
and Major General Chaffee, made public
to-day.
The correspondence begins with the
cablegram given out last week, dated Ma
nila, April 13, in which General Chaffee
recites the killing of the first American
soldier near Malabang and the forming
of an expedition under Baldwin to arrest
the murderers. In answer to this the
following dispatch was sent:
WASHINGTON. D. C. April 20, 1902.âChaf
feÂ», Manila: Expedition ordered under Bald
win will not leave coast until you hear from
bere. This will not. however, Interfere with
complete preparation. CORBIN.
ASKED TO AVOID WAS.
<3lf-AprIl"i2 the following "tcferam was
sent: . . 'Â¦'.'.
Chaffee. Manila: The Presfdent Is anxious
that no expedition against Moros until all ef
forts by negotiations have been exhausted. To
this end he desires that you confer freely with
Ihs acting civil governor. In event the force
has to be sent he directs it go under the im
mediate command of General Davle. The Pres
ident will give you all support, but desires ex
ercise of. great care and prudence. If possi
ble avoid by all honorable means general war.
CORBIN.
Chaffee, Manila: With reference to previous
cables on subject I have suggested to Presi
dent that possibly airrender of Moros mur
denrs might be effected by Instrumentality
fr'cr.tjly dattos. President desires "this consid
ered in conference -with Wright and to have
afsuram.e every honorable peaceful remedy
l^as been exhausted. CORBIN.
General Chaffee responded to the last
cablegram by the dispatch given out at
the White House last night stating that
to withdraw all the American forces
would ruin our prestige; to withdraw part
of the forces would be dangerous. To
this statement the following response was
iKade to-day:
"WASHINGTON, April 23. â Chaffee. Manila:
Tour cabl* of yestfrday has been submitted by
Acting Secretary of War to the President, -who
Clrtcts that you 3:Â»cp in rainJ the resident's
orders, but of course do nothing that will im
jjair our prestige or m any tray imperil the
enr.y. If after the expiration of the time
named in your proclamation and after all po?
e!blÂ» diplomatic an<3 frienflly methods have
been exhausted, your demanfl for the Moros
ir.urdcirrs has not been met, you will act upon
the lines that In your Judgment vc\]\ best serve
to bring peace and order In the island of
Mindanao.
PEACEFUL REMEDIES FIRST.
The "President's orders" referred to in
this dispatch are dated April 20 and April
22. The first directed the expedition under
Colonel Baldwin not to leave the coast
until further orders. The second message
said: "The President Is anxious that no
expedition be made against the Moros un
til all efforts by negotiations have oeen
exhausted."
Brigadier General Davis was directed
to assume command of the expedition in
care it proved necessary to send it, and
the dispatch added: "If possible avoid by
all honorable means a general war."
A third message suggested that the sur
render of the Moros guilty of the murder
of Americans might be effected through
the instrumentality of friendly chiefs.
General Chaffee was instructed to confer
with Acting Governor Wright and in
formed again of the President's wish that
before engaging in war every "honorable,
peaceful remedy be exhausted."
These dispatches show the deep con
cern of the administration in the Moro
situation. While professing to believe that
hostilities will bÂ£ confined to the Moros
of the Lake L*anao region. It sees apos-
Bibllity that other natives In Mindanao'
may join their brethren In fighting the
Christian Invader. It Is especially ~de
tircd by the President that no religious
aspect be given to the war. for If this
should be done there is danger that the
Moros in all parts of the Southern Philip
pines, who are all Mohammedans, will
rice against the Americans.
understands that the President is ready
to order reinforcements to Manila should
they be required.
No additional troopi have been ordered
to the Philippines, but General Chaffee

SAGINAW, Mich., April 23.â Physicians
of the. college hospital have performed a
remarkable operation, that of grafting 1 a
piece of dog's skull upon a human head.
The patient is John Olberg of Kenton,
Houghton County. He is now recovering
from an old affliction: Olberg' s skull was
fractured four years ago. Over the hole,
which was an inch and a half in diameter,'
there formed a foreign growth. This
pressed on the brain and caused convul
sions. When It was decided to operate on
Olberg the doctors chloroformed a dog
and removed a piece of its skull. The
piece taken out was then Implanted in the
opening in Olberg's head.

The Embassador is now 74 years of age,

cally his condition is not good. He has

W., WASHINGTON, April 23.â Lord
Pauncefote, British Embassador, is re
covering from a serious attack of rheu
matic gout. The recurrence of this dis
ease has caused some of .the Embassa
dor's friends to urge him to relinquish
his post here and return to England. In
view of the recent disclosures regarding
the attitude of Great Britain during the
war with Spain, the Embassador feels
.that If he was to leave at this time" his
withdrawal would be attributed to dis
satisfaction on the part of his Govern
ment with his conduct in 1S98. He has,
therefore, decided to remain in Wash
ington for the present, but it is not ex
pected that he will stay in this country
for many months.

Rawlins discussed the campaign made
by Major Waller in the island of Samar
under command of General Smith. He
said that Waller's men performed the

He declared that the troops were ordered
to make the island a "howling .wilder
ness" and kill everybody over the age of
10 years. -

opposing the Philippines temporary gov

the testimony presented to the Committee
on^^hilipp.fries^and.'ihe reports made by
the^ officials, of the War, Department. He
presented many cases of torture. of Fil
ipiuos, ofÂ»the burning of towns, of the
incarceration of Filipinos. All this, he
eaid, was done to carry to the Filipinos
the benign administration of the Ameri
can Government. War, he said, was to
be waged relentlessly, and the articles of
war were to be cast to the winds. The war
to be waged was not to be a war of hu
manity," but a war without mercy.' It was
uncivilized warfare, and without ex

The Oratorio Society ; will, mount the

large, and efficient. The staging will be
.under the direction of Charles Williams,
one _pf the best amateur actors in the
Sta-t^y. who has had much experience in
such. affairs. In' staging and business the
cpera wjirbe the same as in the original
production' at the Savoy Theater, London,
wbereitj-was given under the direction of
the, authors.
berime*' will be related by- a chorus ' of
nearly 100 voices and a cast of characters
well able to sustain the important roles.
rehearsals' of the opera, which is
under the direction of Wilbur McColl of
the Conservatory of the University of
the Pacific, are proof that its production
will rank with that of most professional
companies. The cast will include Mrs.
Mary Weaver-McCauly as Yum Yum,,
Miss Alice Genevieve McMillan as Pitti

Elmer Chase as the Mikado, ' J. M. Rey
nolds as Pooh Bah, Wallace ' Avery as

Lessler of New York supplemented
Craemer's statement by serving notice
that when the omnibus bill was brought
before the House a fight would be made
for the incorporation in it of the New
York postoffice bill. '
Several other amendments -Offered by
the minority- were defeated. ".The ! Senate
amendments- were successfully adopted
as the reading of the bill proceeded. Â¦> .
1 At the opening of the session of the
House Craemer of New York rose to. a
question of privilege and had read at the
clerk's desk an. article in a . New York
paper charging the New York -.members
with "being dummies and derelict in their
duty" in connection with the bill for a
new postoffice building in New York City.
The Speaker ruled that the article read
did not constitute a question of personal
privilege, but Craemer was given five
minutes in which to explain himself. He
recounted what the New York delegation
had done in the matter. When Cummings
(now stricken with illness) was at their
head the delegation had gone to the Com
mittee on Public Grounds and Buildings
and had received assurances that a. sep
arate bill would be reported for the New
York postoffice. Now It seemed, said he,
that another commission was to be. pro
vided by the terms of the omnibus bill
agreed on yesterday to examine into the
question of a suitable site. '
Wadsworth of New York, chairman of
the Agricultural Committee, finally suc
ceeded in offering an amendment chang
ing the section providing that oleomar
garine free from .artificial .coloration,
which is taxable at one-fourth of a cent
per pound, so. as to provide that ."colored 1
butter shall not be construed as colora
tion." The amendment was lostâ 51 to Jss.'
The major portion of the 'debate bore
on the general merits of the bill and not
on the Senate amendments. . When the
consideration of . the , amendments began
the chair ruled that the text of the bill
agreed to by both the House' and Senate
was not open to amendment. â¢Â¦-
This ruling, made by Olmstead of Penn
sylvania, who was in the chair, prevented
tne offering of many amendments which
the minority members of the Agricultural
committee decided to offer. Â¦ ' . â¢ Â¦ â¢
WASHINGTON, April 23.â The House
to-day began consideration of 'the Senate
amendments to the oleomargarine bill. A
special rule for this purpose was adopted
by a vote of 152 to 79. By the ruling of
the chair the question of further amend
ment of the Senate propositions was con
fined within very narrow HmUs. Slow
progress was made. The oppoii3nts of
the measure, who sought to modify the
Senate amendments in various particu
lars, were outvoted on every proposition
submitted.

way out of the crowd. A striker engaged

The disorder began early in the day and
was unexpected. â¢ A meeting of strikers
was held at 8 o'clock at.'Rueger's^ River
side Hall, and 2000 men gathered at the
place. The hall would not accommodate
them all, and the proceedings were slow
because of the many nationalities repre
sented. To -simplify matters it was nnal
ly decided to have the men of each. shop
on strike appoint a ( committee, of five to
represent them. The meeting was. orderly
and declared for peace, and the men were
urged to keep away from the shops. The
meeting of the committees formulated .the
demands of the strikers for the following
scale of wages: '; â¢â¢ â¢ v " ' f- Â¦ -,
Helpers, "Zff cents per hour; machine
men, 22 cents; finishers, 22 cents; appren
tices, not less than 20 cents, and also that
fifty-five hours shall constitute a week's
work; that time and a half be allowed for
overtime; that five minutes be allowed
for washing-up before quitting time, and
that the scale be accepted for five years.
The old prices per hour were: Helpers,
16^8 cents; machine men, 18^4 ' cents; fin
ishers, 22 cents; learners. 14% cents.
While the meeting was in progress hun
dreds of strikers stood outside the hall
angrily discussing their grievances. The
radicals urged a raid upon the works still
in operation, and when their suggestion
was approved headed a rush for the plant
of Johnson, Cowdin &- Co. The men at
work there were- called out, and the strik
ers moved on to -the establishment of
James Simpson & -Go. That firm, fearing
trouble, dismissed the men and closed its
doors. Robert Â¦ Gaede's works were vis
ited next, and. after that the Bamford

believed -'for". a time' that it would be

restore Â¦ order, ; but the police expressed
confidence in their ability to handle the
situation, and no request for outside aid
was made. Judge Dixon called the Grand
Jury and charged them to indict the per
sons guilty of rioting. .
The conservative- element among, tne
strikers had in -the meantime disavowed
the violence of their fellows, and urged
a return to peacetul means. to gain tne
end that is sought. Large numbers of
the strikers were in sullen . spirit,' and it
was predicted to-night that any attempt

A Victory Oyer an Insidioas Disease
After the Failures of Physicians.
The liver is the great housekeeper of
our health. On its right and proper ac-
tion depends our enjoyment of life.
One of the commonest indications of a
disordered and diseased. liver Is a nasty
tongueâ furred and coated. Such a con-
dition. Is Dositjve proof that the liver is
not working well. Other symptoms are a*
follows: Nauseous taste .in. -the mouth:
pains under the shoulder blades and in
tho region of the kidneys. Frequently the
1 mental -symptoms of liver . trouble are
more dangerous than- the bodily ills. Suf-
ferers experience mental anguish, gloomy
forebodlngs, melancholy and a general
feeling of disgust with life.. \
.When, these bodily and mental troubles
are experienced your liver tells you.it
needs Immediate help.' If the proper med-
icine i Is not used ,at once* sickness and
death follow. . . ...
Paine's Celery Compound fs the one
great specific for the eure of liver trou-,
bles. It always acts gently and effective-
ly on the root of the evils, driving from
the system accumulations of morbid poi-
sons that give rise to your suffering. Soon
every organ Is infused with new life, the
skin Is fxesh'.and clear and you enjoy
perfect' health. - . -
Mr. Clyde F. 'Tucker, Savannah, Ohio,
with a desire of benefiting men and wom-
en who are suffering from any bf the va-
ried forms of liver complaints, writes as
follows:
"I had been taking medicine under the
direction of' three doctors, but they did
not give me relief. The doctors said my
liver was in a very bad condition. A
friend recommended Paine's Celery Com-
pound to me, and I began to feel better be-
fore I had taken half a bottle. As I con-
tinued to use the compound I grew better,
until I became a well man. I weighed
only 100 pounds when I was sick; now I-
weigh 143 pounds." j

FEAR HASTENS
THE EVACUATION
The outburst of applause that met the
name of Hanna was fully as generous as
any that had been given during the day.
The convention adjourned until 9 o'clock
Thursday morning.
There was a great outburst of cheers
as the speaker concluded, and then came
loud calls of "Fairbanks." Senator Bev
erldge called for the senior Senator, and
as Fairbanks appeared on the platform
he was I greeted | with- loud and long-con
tinued cheers, i Fairbanks began 3 his
speech by declaring that. the Republican
party had been as conspicuous in its abil
ity to rule as the Democratic party had
been in its inability to govern this coun
try. The strongest orators in proclaim
ing the virtues of Republican rule, he
said, were | . speaking' to-day upon the
farms throughout the republic, from the
mines, from the Â¦Â¦â¢ factories and from all
the great avenues of human endeavor. .
â¢ Frederick Landls of. Wabash brought
forth loud cheers â¢ by his Â¦ assertion that
he believed "in the party of Mark Hanna,
who had never lost a fight and never
would lose one."
: It Is tha twentieth century In which wÂ« live
â the greatest period . since time began. We
cannot cling to the methods of the past. The
republic has marched â¢ ever forward, only be
cause our fathers cut behind them plans 'and
policies which civilization had outgrown and
adopted new ones as their new day demanded
them. We, their children, must do the same.
Their war cry was "Onward!". Our war cry
must be "Onward," too. The Republican
party is the organized spirit of American prog
ress. We dare not stoop- to demagogues' de
vices; that Is the role of. the opposition to the
Government. We dare not trick up fictitious
issues to catch temporary applause. We dare
not be Insincere to capture this . or that co
terie of voters. We dare not counsel with fear
or compromise with reaction. Our success, our
very life, is In harmony with the progress of
the American people to the mastery of 'the
world. ' ' i
I . Ho . declined to say j that he was the
mouthpiece ~of the . administration "--.* of
President' Koosevelt, but would not deny
that â¢ ; what he had to â¢ say regarding | na
tional Issues had been in a large measure
approved: at "Washington. '.:Â¦ Â¦ ':;Â¦
The Senator was - greeted with cheers
when he appeared oa the platform, and
when, he' commenced the delivery of his
address. There wer^ frequent outbursts
of applause , throughout tha delivery of
the speech. CÂ» 'Â¦'Â¦''Â¦' â¢-.'...Â¦' â¢ Â¦
' â¢ Trio Senator reviewed extensively r: the
growth of large combinations of capital
and the effect they exercise on the coun
try's prosperity. He, maintained . that
trusts are not a menace â¢ to the welfare
of the people, and that while evils may
exist in them, the remedy is within easy
'reach. He spoke Interestingly of Cuba
and the Philippines, and in concluding he
said: .,,,.. .
: INDIANAPOLIS, April 23.â Much.', ora
tory and enthusiasm marked the opening
of- the Republican State Convention- In
Tbmlinson' Hall this afternoon. g Senator
Albert J. Beverldge delivered an eloquent'

ples 'Â¦ upon which | the Republicans Â¦ of Â¦ In

Health will come with all its blessings to those who know the way, and it is mainly a ques-
tion of right-living, with all the term implies, but the efforts which strengthen the system,
the games which refresh and the foods which nourish are important, each in a way, while it is
also advantageous to have knowledge of the best u>ethods of promoting freedom from unsani-
tary conditions. To assist nature, when nature Â»eeds assistance, it is all important that the
medicinal agents used should be of the best quality and of known value, and the one remedy
which acts most beneficially and pleasantly, as a laxative, isâ Syrup of Figsâ manufactured by
the California Fig Syrup Co. .
With a proper understanding of the fact that many physical ills are of a transient char-
acter and yield promptly to the gentle action of Syrup of Figs, gladness and comfort come to
the heart, and if one would remove the torpor and strain and congestion attendant upon a con-
stipated condition of the system, take Syrup of Figs and enjoy freedom from the aches and '
pains, the colds and headaches and the depression due to inactivity of the bowels. In case of \
any organic trouble it is well to consult a competent physician, but when a laxative is required
remember that the most permanently gratifying results, will follow personal cooperation with
the beneficial effects of Syrup of Figs. It is for sale by all reliable druggists. Price fifty
cents per bottle.
The excellence of Syrup of Figs comes from the beneficial effects of the plants used in the
combination and also from the method of manufacture which ensures that perfect purity and .
uniformity of product essential in a perfect family laxative. All the members of the family
from the youngest to the most advanced in years may usjb it whenever a laxative is needed and --
share alike in its beneficial effects. We do not claim that Syrup of Figs is the only remedy of . .
known value, but it possesses this great advantage over all other laxatives that it acts gently
and pleasantly without disturbing natural functions, in anyway, as it is free from every ob-
jectionable quality or substance. To get its beneficial effects it is always necessary, to buy the
genuine and the full name of the Co.â California Fig Syrup Co.â is printed on the front of every
package. . ,

company was not justified in "its latest
demand. The men, he sÂ«i;a, had as much
right t, to dictate terms as. the company's
representatives and | he declared j that "the
city of San Francisco "would be tied up

The demands submitted by the carmen
to the company are generally regarded by
the Strikers as eminently just, and they
are hopeful that the company, will enter
tain the Fame view and thus bring the
strike to an end. While the men are as
determined as ever to hold out until their
demands are granted by" the; corporation,
the more conservative of -the strikers are
anxious that a speedy settlement should
be reached. - -- -. . ---. :'i ,
A committee from' the. Bakers' Union
called at headquarters during the atter
ncon and reported.^ amid applause, that
their union had donated â¢ $400 lovthe Amal
gamated Association' of Street Railway*
Employes. The strikers were -told that
the money was available when demand
ed, and that if it was. necessary to do so
the union would furnish free bread to the
striking carmen until their fight 'was won.
A vote of thanks was tendered to the
bakers for their generosity. â¢
Samuel Pinkerton. the man who was ar
rested at the Mission-street carhouse
Monday for carrying a concealed, weapon,,
created a sensation at headquarters l>7,
filing his application to become a member
of the association. The application was
taken under advisement and Pinkerton
placed on probation.
Eighty applications for membership . in
the union were received during <the day,
about half of these beinp from men who
recently arrived - from the interior and
mho are seeking positions as conductors
and motormen. It is claimed that less
than a dozen employes of the railway
system still refuse to join the union. The
membership of the union now reaches
nearly 3000, .an increase of some 2^X) since
the inauguration-of-tb'e.etrlke. ...-.- â¢
A number of union carmen^who some;
time ago filed applications witft the raii

â¢Jereonal letters' from Manager Vining
within' the week inviting them to call and
talk the, matter over. Several have sent
replies informing Vining that they will
consult with him after the strike has been
declared off.
The proposition submitted by the com
pany to meet the strikers in the offices of
the corporation was discussed pro and
con. "Many men insisted tha t-'the confer
ence be held in the officte . of Mayor-
Schmitz, while others said. that the com
pany, being willing? to yield, the right to
select the place of 'conference should be
left with. it. Thte'View was generally ac
cepted as the more prudential one, and
the. executive committee, after feeling the
popular pulse, as it were, decided to carry
cut the suggestion.

At the close of the meeting President

Our prospects are very favorable. The com

courtesy. - They had a most . pleasant confer

be favorable to our cause. . In the jneaawhllo

keenly felt the discomfort tVie people of tho

Our only wish was that we could have takm

'Assurances 'of support are." being, re

resolutions were adopted:^

Â¦Whereas, The demands of the streetcar men
are Just and reasonable; and < . ...

'^President Holland and Attorney Ford
confirmed' the statement made by Knox.
Both said the 'Â¦ matter j was discussed in

as soon as the demands could be digested
by the futt board of directors the' carmen
would be again called to meet with the
directors, and all differences would then
probably- be settled. â¢-' .-.:..,
Considerable good feeling was mani
fested last night at the headquarters of
the car employes at the Turk-street Tem
ple. Soon, after the .committee returned
from the conference the members went
into the room of the executive committee
and remained in . conference for several
hours. The hall gradually filled â¢â¢ with
men, and about 8 o'clock Knox. an
nounced to those -present the . result ' of
the day's work.- He said: .,*7* * :.
We met the directors of the United Railroads
in conference this afternoon and discussed - the
matter in all its phases. We are not prepared
to makel public what occurred, at the meeting
but one thing I can tell you. is that we were
most pleasantly received and â¢ want over every
phase of our demands. - There will be nothing
doing to-night. So go to your homes and rest
for you may need to use your muscles as "of
old before many hours. â¢ ...Â¦â¢,--Â¦
The directors told us they wanted us ta
present our demands to â¢ a . full board, tent as
several of them cannot be on hand to-night
their, decision must bs deferred until to-mor
row. They win notify Mayor Schmitz and he
will notify us. . Hope for the best.
The e,xecutive and arbitration commit
tees of the. car employes were In session
until a late hour last night considering
possible objections to the various sections
of the demand and the best arguments
to advance. to. overcome such objections

refused to confess, a,- companion^ having
confessed, was put in^ close confinement.
The committee finds that an' outrage was
committed in punishing -the -unfortunate
man for refusing to. confess >to ; a crime
of which he had not been convicted, and
adds that Reynolds and Oliver "are men
in charge responsible to the territorial
government ahd to humanity for such

are forced to the conclusion that not

also, that he has neglected hla work in
other respects. He has shirked grave
professional duties, delegating them to a
leper who has no professional training.
He has kept- no data worth mentioning.

LYNN, Mass., April 23.â Two: Lynn men,;
William Labell and Albert W. Bertrand,
formerly privates in Company D, Twenty
sixth Regiment, U. S. V., have- Bent to
Senator Lodge a statement of Instances
of the application of the "water cure" in
the Philippines that came under their
observation. Bertrand was clerk of Com
pany D and regimental clerk at headquar
ters while the regiment was stationed at
Panay. Latell says that while at Anllao
three natives were taken by Company D
men into a Catholic church and given the
"water cure." One of the natives refused
to tell where Insurgent guns were secret
ed and. after he had been given the "wa
ter cure" he was blindfolded and one of
the soldiers fired his gun near the man's
head. The instant the gun was fired an
other member of the squad hit the native
with a stone and he was told he had been
shot. The native then told the United
States soldiers where they could find the
guns. Labell gives the names of the of
llcers and privates who participated in
administering the punishment.
Labell further says that in the sum
mer of 1900, while the United States forces
were about three miles from Estancla,
Company D captured three natives and
gave them the "water otire." After the
men had been filled with water, blood
came from their eyes and ears. â¢
Bertrand has furnished Senator Lodge
with particulars of the alleged disap
pearance and killing of Father Augustine,
a Catholic priest. He says it was report
ed that Father Augustine knew where in
surgent gold ,was burled. Men from Com
pany D captured him in 1900 and dressed
him in a uniform of the United States
artillery. He was then taken to Banato
and kept in a well. He refused to tell
where the gold was buried, and on the
night of December 9 he was taken to a
house formerly occupied by the Presi
dente of the village. Upon his arrival
there, Bertrand says, the water cure was
given. him by the "water cure squad."
The men proceeded to get nearly all the
water out of him, but lie did not revive
The men became frightened, and a sur
geon was sent for. His services proved
unsuccessful, and, Bertrand says, the
priest died. Â¦ :â¢'Â¦
Some of the men were sworn to Becrecy,
and the body was burled in a plat of land
used by the troops as a baseball ground
Bertrand says that a non-commlssloned
officer was seen with the priest's watch
and chain, and when the commanding of
ficer learned this they were turned over
to him. Bertrand gives the names of the
men taking part, and also refers to sev
eral officers.
. According to Labell, when Company D
was out on a "hike" while stationed at
Dungas In July, 1900, the. men were or
dered to burn everything, and see that no
grown person escaped.. - . . -
This, Labell says, the men proceeded to
do. Labell and Bertrand say that while
at Dungas the soldiers: came to a hut
where a native woman had Just given
birth to a child. The husband was made
a prisoner, and the woman and' child were
dragged from the house and. left on the
ground. The native- shack was then
burned, but Labell and. Bertrand do not
know what became of the woman and
child. Â¦â¢ : Â¦ ,

TACOMA, April 23.â Although the ques
tion of obtaining funds for the payment of
the expenses of the State of Washington
in prosecuting its action against the
Northern Securities Company Is admitted
to be very serious, Governor McBrlde as
serted emphatically to-day that he would
not follow the course of Governor Van

sinews for fighting the merger.
*'I .would pay the expenses out of my
own pocket first," he said.
When asked how much money there
was now available to pay traveling and
incidental expenses of the Attorney Gen
eral in <he railroad case, he said there
was none. The small fund appropriated
for the incidental expenses of the Attor
ney General haa been exhausted, but the
Governor has a fund of $1000, appropriated
to defray the costs of Investigations into
alleged infractions of the law. Possibly
thie money can be used.

WASHINGTON, April 23.-The House
Committee on Naval Affairs to-day
amended the provision of the naval ap
propriation bill bÂ» that one of the new
battleships or armored cruisers must be
built in a Government navy-yard.
At the 'meeting yesterday a provision
was adopted giving the Secretary of the
Navy discretionary authority to build
any or ail of the new ships In Government
yards. But the friends of the navy-yard
proposition were not,. satisfied with this,
maintaining that, as the Navy Depart
ment officially was opposed to building in
Government yards, the discretionary au
thority would not be exercised.
As a result, the provision, was amended
to-day so that the Secretary's authority
remains as to build all the ships in Gov
ernment yards, but the additional pro
vision is made that one battleship or one
armored cruiser shall be built in such
navy-yard as the Secretary may desig
nate. An appropriation of $175,000 Is made
to fit up the yard for ship-building pur
poees, and arrangement is made for a
test of the merits of Government con
struction by keeping detailed accounts of
labor and material, leaves of absence,
etc., so that the. items of cost may be
compared with those of construction in
private shipyards. The vote directing the
building of the ship in a Government yard

How to buy furniture
and carpets
without ready
money
o â â '. â '. â â -
We will loan you the money for a regular banking
rate of interestâ six per cent. And you can pay . us
back little by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the first-class furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big and fresh and where satisfaction is certain,* and
. when you have made your selection you can pay your
bill in full with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
and being compelled' to select your goods from smaller
and inferior stocks?
The installment stores charge you ; ten per cent
above their cash prices when you ask for long credit.
.; - All you pay us is six per cent. 'â¢ , .
For example: If your purchases amount' to $100.00
we wilf charge you $106.00â which is a six percent
advance; then you pay us $20.00 cash and the balance
in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month.
* If your purchases amount to $75.00 we will charge you
$79-50; you make us a cash payment on this of $15.00
and pay the balance at the easy rate of $6.45 per
month.
You save four per cent You have the great privi-
lege of buying in a first-class store, and yet you get
all the advantages of the easy payment plan as offered
by the installment houses!
No amount of money is too small for us to. loan.; .
Worth looking into, don't you think?"

It behooves the people of California to "give, heed

be taken to choose men who will give attention to

diminished, and the menace of a -'deforested ' country
So near is the exhaustion of the timber in those
States that the Department of Agriculture is en
gaged in trying to find a means of profitably cultivat
ing the land after it has been stripped of its trees.' It
is of course quite probable that suitable crops will
be found, but the best of them will I not take the
place of trees nor fulfill all the functions of a forest.
They will not so ' effectively conserve moisture, nor
have such beneficial influences upon climate.! Streams
that through the forests have been running with
steady flow of waters from time, immemorial will
rush away in swollen torrents during the winter. and
after heavy summer 1 rains, leaving the channel- dry in
time of drought Such evils have befallen everyland
where there has been a complete destruction of for
ests, and American experience in that respect is not
going to be different from that of the Old World. : : ;
The Secretary, who has just returned from a trip
through the South, says: "The destruction, of the
forests in the South, and especially in Georgia and
Florida, is proceeding with great rapidity. The land
is being rapidly cleared, and before it is top late a
new agricultural industry must take the place of the
old. The cutting of timber for the market and for
turpentine and like products yields an immense, in
come to the South. But the end is in sight."
SECRETARY WILSON has just given the
country another warning of the approaching
destruction of some of the largest and richest
of our forests. The regions of which he speaks are
the pine lands of the Southern States. It is but a few
years ago that sanguine Americans believed these
woods to.' be 'practically inexhaustible. People
used to say that the forests of New I England, the
Middle States and the Lake States had been swept
away because the country was comparatively well
settled, but the South, being so sparsely settled,
would retain its forests indefinitely. That optimistic
view is now refuted. The pine woods of Georgia
and Florida,' like those of Minnesota and Michigan,
are about to vanish.

"The Slaves of the Orient," in' which"
MANY days have passed since the first reports
came that Briton and Boer had agreed to
, negotiate terms of peace. It is true that at
first such reports were "officially" denied, but of late
the officials have ceased to make denial, and so,
while nothing authoritative has been given out, it, is
admitted that for weeks the negotiations have been
going on, but apparently very little has been accom
plished. . . '
It is not easy to understand why so much time
should be required in arranging the preliminaries
unless it be that every proposition of the Boers has
to be reported to London and is there discussed at
leisure by the Ministry instead of by . authorized
agents of the Government at some point in South
Africa. Since it seems assured the Boers are willing
to waive their demand for independence, the British
ought certainly to be willing to concede them . a
large measure of self-government, and with those
two propositions agreed upon at the start the rest
ought to be easy. Â¦ Â»
Each side has good reason to desire peace. The
winter season oi the Southern Hemisphere is ap
proaching, and the Boer leaders naturally shrink
from requiring their commandos to undergo another
dreary winter campaign hunted up and down across
the' plains and through the mountains by ten times
their numbers. Moreover, large as were their sup
plies at the start and considerable as have been the
quantities of ammunition and stores they have been
able to smuggle into their country since the war be
gan, they can hardly be well equipped for a con
tinuance of the conflict. It is certainly better for
them to make terms, while they' can than to run the
risk of '- complete subjection during the coming
winter.
On the other hand, there are reasons of urgency
to impel the British to grant fair terms. The official
.statement of British expenditures for the fiscal year
which ended March 31 is as follows:
Expenditure .';' $977,616,075
Revenue Â» 714,989,995

'. Net deficiency ;;;. : $111,995,135 ,.'
In the. budget for the coming year the Ministry
has proposed not only an increase in, the income tax
and the imposition of a. bread tax. but it has also
been forced to offer another loan. Thus this war
has already increased the debt 6f # Great Britain by a
sum in excess. of the entire reduction made "during
the reign of Victoria.
â¢ The' chief reason, however, why theSBritish should
be eager to make peace is.that-they intend to rincor
porate the country, into their empire and include the'
Boers -among theif fellow-countrymen..; That being
so, it is clear they should be above all things de
sirous of granting ; terms that will go far toward re
lieving the animosities, born: of the war. : It is there
fore surprising that so long a time has been required
to arrange terms. : It \ must be that the contending
parties are the stubbornest on theface of the earth.

times in London: Miss Elliott is to-day
the most gentle, sympathetic and radiant
ly beautiful actress before the public and
her role in this poetic idyl is said to have
placed her at the very top of her chosen
vocation. Mr. Goodwin, who ranks wl^h
his most accomplished contemporaries,
has in this his most congenial role. Mr.
Goodwin and Miss Elliott bring with them
the name fine production that was used

The play has Just closed a ten weeks'

will be the first and only one outside of

Los Angeles, preparatory to the presenta
tion here,, and from the first performance

CONSIDERABLE interest has been

" duction of Opie Read's new play,
:"The' Star-bucks." by the Nelll
Encouraged by that statement of the law, a move
ment is now under way to have the Legislature deal
promptly with the issue. The fight against the ad
vertising nuisance has been carried on in Massachu
setts for a sufficient length of time to have fully edu
cated public sentiment with respect for it. Of course
the interests on .the side of the maintenance of the
nuisance are strong and resourceful, so the victory
for the public will not be won without a hard strug
gle. Still the chances are good that Massachusetts
will in this respect set an example that will be fol
lowed throughout the country. It is not everywhere
necessary to appeal to State legislation, for in most
States municipalities have ample authority to sup
press the nuisance, but a legislative act will attract
more attention than a mere municipal ordinance, and
accordingly the efforts in that direction now being
made in Massachusetts are worth studying by all
who share the desire that our streets may be soon
relieved from these gross disfigurements.
Passing to a consideration of the particular evil
complained of on the part of the public as committed
by the billboard and fence advertising nuisance, the
Attorney General went on to say: "Noises and odors
have always been treated as nuisances, even without
legislative adjudication that they are unwholesome.
There is no legal reason why an offense to the eye
should have a different standing from an offense to
the other organs. To strike the unwilling eye is in
principle the same as to catch the unwilling eye.
Obnoxious signs have rarely been held to be action
able nuisances because only lately the attention of
the courts has been called to this aggressive mode
of disfiguring the landscape. An advertisement upon
private land anywhere may be a nuisance. In every
case it would be a question of what is reasonable un
der the circumstances. The right to put glaring
signs jwhere people may not- escape them is meas
ured by the degree of annoyance to which the public
may be reasonably required to submit for the benefit
of private interests."
MASSACHUSETTS has engaged in earnest
in the work of ridding her cities from .the
abominations of the . signboard and fence
advertising nuisance. It appears that under the con
stitution of that State no municipality is clothed
with sufficient authority to deal effectively with the
evil, and accordingly the State itself is about to take
it up.
In a recently delivered opinion on the subject the
Attorney General of the State is reported as
saying: "The local authorities in the various
cities and towns of the commonwealth have
power under existing laws to regulate and
restrict the display of advertisements only
within the limits . of public parks, boulevards and
highways." He went on to add, however: "The
Legislature may within the lawful exercise of police
power impose restrictions upon the use of private
property and no right to recover damages is thereby
created."
THE SIGNBOARD NUISANCE.
A recent arrival in. this city was accused and
acquitted the other day on a charge of vagrancy. He
wastrying to teach a girl how to smoke opium. The
fellow probably knew, if 'the authorities did not, that
his crime was too pc-fniciously^ctive to be styled
vagrancy. .. - '"-4* â¢Â¦ : *'
Since the matter has 'been so long before the
courts, the Justices of the supreme tribunal might
well deem themselves justified by considerations of
public welfare in advancing the case upon the calen
dar and giving it an early hearing. . The ordinance
involves an issue of the highest importance to a very
large proportion of the people of San Franciscc. It
is not like a case in- which no public interests are in
volve.l. It isone that concern's tKeVgrowth and the
health of, a' large city, and; i/ therefore entitled to
prompt attention from the court.
At the time when the cemeteries within the limits
of San Francisco were established. they were remote
frorr thf thickly settled parts of the city, and few
persons thought that with the life of^a'single genera-,
tion â in fact, before the pioneers had passed awayâ
the population would have extended^westward until,
it had surrounded with homes- the. grounds ; upon
which the cemeteries were established. Such, how
ever, is what Â¦ has happened. . It now^depends upon,
this generation to get rid ofwhat "is already arievil!
and which would become more and, more pernicious^
with each succeeding year of its continuance. -It is:
to be hoped the Supreme Court will "find the present
ordinance valid. If, howeverj the opposite view be
taken by^the court, it will then behoovethe Super
visors tc enact a new ordinance.
The problem with which the ordinance deals is by
no means peculiar to San Francisco. Every. impdr- 1
tant city in the Old World had at one time a "cemex:
tery within its limits, and almost all 'of the older
American cities were in the same condition. ;.. The:
advance of sanitary science has taught" men the evil j
effects of burying the dead in the; neighborhood of
the residences of the living, and consequently in all'
well regulated cities the practice has been forbidden.
. The case has been in litigation a long time, and
the public - has had ample opportunity to note ; the
effect of the ordinance. While there: was at first a
good deal of opposition to it upon sentimental
grounds, it is safe to say that public . is
now well nigh, unanimous in favor, of it. . .. , . .
JUDGES Cook, Lawlor and Dunne, sitting in
bane, have sustained the decision of , the lower
court in the case brought to test the ordinance
prohibiting burials within the ,limits .'of. the.': city.'
Their decision sustains the validity of the Ordinance.
An appeal, however, has been taken arid : the matter
now goes up to the Supreme. Court for final decision...
THE CEMETERY ORDINANCE.
The Sunday closing of saloons in New York under
the reform regime has occasioned such ' a rush to the
hotels for drinks that a reporter of the Tribune, in
describing the situation, says the city was "saloon
dry, but hotel wet."' The hotels refused to sell liquors
unless at least a sandwich was ordered, and the re- 1
porter says: "The panhandlers and strikers were
overfed yesterday with left-over sandwiches. * * *
No thirsty soul went unsatisfiedâ that is, none went
far." It is admitted on all sides that the law was
strictly observed; and so reform is justified and the
bread and ham market has- a boom.
It has already become evident that Billy Herrin is
making this fight in a manner even more un
scrupulous than usual. He is fighting for big stakes
this time. Should the corporation amendment to
the constitution^be .carried Gage will be able to put
into power a subservient "to the railroads
that will enable the corporations to defy : public
opinion with impunity .for years to come. To ac
complish that end he will have no hesitation
in packing the convention with railroad henchmen
if he can. If Republicans cannot defeat his scheme
they will be themselves defeated. ,
The matter is all the more important because it is
now known that except for the Herrin alliance with
Kelly, Burns, Crimmins, Burke, Lynch and the rest
of the predatory bosses there is no sign of any fac
tional fight in the Republican camp. Those men,
with their following of henchmen, constitute the only
disturbing element in the party. Outside of the
reach of their influence everything tends to Jiarmony
and victory. Reports to that effect 'come from every
part of the State. The leading Republican papers
everywhere bear emphatic evidence to it, and the
proceedings, of the convention of the State League
of Republican Clubs confirmed; it. Gage, then, is
the one menace to the party, and no scheme of his is
more menacing than that of packing the State con
vention with appointed delegates. .
Jhe executive committee of the Republican Stale
Committee* which has been called to meet on Mon
day, has the responsibility of dealing with the issue
at once. It should make no mistake. It should re
sort to no half- way measures. It should at once put
itself on record in favor of holding primaries in
every county in the State, so that every Republican
n ry have an equal voice in the election of delegates
to the nominating convention. A plan for general
primaries should be drafted for submission to the
State Committee, so that the dissatisfaction felt over
the discovery of the Gage scheme may be allayed at
once.
BY the bosses who are managing Gage's strug
gle for renominatipn there has been devised
.a desperate scheme to pack \he Republican
convention " by appointing- delegates from all coun
ties where they have control- of the party machin
ery and where the law does not require the holding
of primaries. The scheme is a. desperate one,, be
cause, if carried out it would rouse against the
bosses, an indignation even keener than that which
now exists. In fact, if through any such tactics Gage
were renominated it would mean such an overwhelm
ing revolt against the head of the ticket as would
seriously endanger the whole.
' The Republican party has a bright prospect of
sweeping victory in the coming election, but it can
not afford to take any such risks as the bosses pur
pose to compel it to take. It will not do for the
party to enter the canvass under the domination of
Herrin and his' gang, nor will it be safe for it to
tolerate even a suspicion of such domination. It
must be made clear from the start and kept so to the
finish that the affairs V>f the party are administered
by genuine Republicans, that its conventions speak
for true Republicanism and that its candidates stand
for Republican principles and for State and national
welfare. If there be any well founded doubts upon
those points every candidate on the ticket will be
handicapped even in the strongest Repub
lican districts,, for the protest against Gage comes
from Republicans and not merely from independents
and mugwumps. /
Nothing would more surely strengthen popular
sentiment against the State ticket than the nomina
tion of Gage by a- convention largely composed of
members who had been appointed by machine politi
cians instead of being elected by the rank and file
.of the party. No true Republican can watch with
out indignation the efforts of a Democrat like Billy
Herrin to pull the wires of a Republican conven
tion and name Republican candidates, and conse-.
quently if he be permitted to pack the State conven
tion of the party in the shameless way proposed the
results will be disastrous.

At 4:15 o'clock the court adjourned un
til 10 o'clock this morning, at which hour
Collins will resume his argument Ex-
Judge S. C. Denson will close for the Gov
ernment. . . y
- Thfe speaker drew the attention of the
jury to the fact that Dimmick, if guilty,
was no ordinary criminal, but a man of
Intelligence and great cunning, with the
ability to Cover up his tracks and make
plausible excuses lor whatever might
seem suspicious or Improper. But, it hap
pened, said the speaker, that Dimmick
had left enough traces to convince the
jury beyond a 'reasonable doubt of his
guilt. Attention was called particularly
to the fact that Dimmick spent three
days changing the combination on the
vault for Cole, when, according to the tes
timony of the locksmiths, it could have
been done in fifteen minutes. The testi
mony showed that Dimmick- practically
dictated to Cole what the combination
should be and was thus enabled himself
to open the vault should he choose to do
so. Woodworth pointed out as a signifi
cant feature of the *case the fact that
Dimmick denied that he ever owned or
ever had a dress stilt case in his posses
sion, on which point Dimmick is contra
dicted by no less than eleven reputable
and disinterested witnesses. The two
streetcar conductors, who saw Dimmick
going toft and coming from the Mint,
Watchman Ellis, who saw Dimmick leav
ing the Mint" at midnight with the dress
suit case in his hand; Brown, who sold
the suit case; the boy Sllverstein, who re
ceived a tip from Dimmick for carrying
the case to a Woman on McAllister street,
and Metcalf, who saw Dimmick at night
in the Mint with the dress suit on, and
the dress ' suit Â¦ case lying on the table,
had testified most positively in the mat
ter. All that Dimmick could oppose to
this evidence was. the testimony of Mrs.
Dimmick and the servant girl, who swore
that they never saw him with a dress
suit case. .
The defense, argued Woodworth, had
not introduced a particle of evidence to
discredit the Government's witnesses or
to break dowh the force of their testi
mony.
George D. Collins, counsel for the de
fendant, began his argument for the de
fense at 3 o'clock.' He hammered Woodr
worth's argument by remarking that that
gentleman had built his entire argument
on matters outside the evidence. The
speaker then . proceeded to attempt to
show that Cole, Day, Washington, Leach
and Fitzpatrlck had access to the safe
equally with the defendant and that Dim
mick should not be held responsible for
the i shortage because Superintendent
Leach had seen fit to employ a blunder
ing and Incompetent cashier, such as Cole
was, who came from Martinez; who had
had no experience in handling money and
"who didn't know anything about any
thing."
Secret Service Agent Burns came in for
a little sarcasm, being referred to as a
confidence man in the line of his official
business. Tne counsel also took pleasure
in twitting Messrs. Burns and Hazen for
having â¢ failed to find the . stolen money.
"It was notorious that police officers and
detectives will color their testimony by.
their zeal to convict," said Collins, "and
therefore their testimony should be re
ceived with great caution."
In the Dimmlck . trial yesterday United
States Attorney Marshall B. Woodworth
consumed two hours and- a half in his
argument to the jury on behalf of the
prosecution. He began at 11 a. m., spoke
until 12:30 p. m., the time for recess, and
from 2 to 3 p. m. It was Woodworth's
best effort and he was warmly compli
mented by his friends upon his masterly
collocation of facts and his logic.

the Superior Court yesterday. Miss La

was no trouble over the O'Hare estate
until Miss Tillle Rogers,' \ a niece of
O'Hare, fell in love with H. C. Judklns,
the attorney, and allowed herself to be
controlled by him.
Mrs. Gowdey was questioned closely
concerning several items in her account,
but she vouchsafed but little informa

search into the cause of the family Quar

was an extensive loss of beardt, .With In-

Track Notes.
But for a pair of knees that look the
worse for wear and tear, Maraschino
would be a very shifty performer. The
three-year-old closed favorite for the last
race, a mile and 100 yards run, and was
beaten in a drive by Merops, an 8 to 1
shot, backed to 6. Rasp finished third.
Caesar Young's, good mare Eonic en
joyed a Cakewalk in the mile and a six
teenth selling run. A 3 to 5 favorite, she
made all the pace, disposing of Obia wlth
?^. t J effort - Limelight ran a moderate
third.
A staggerer for the crowd waa the de
feat of Alsono, the 4 to 5 choice for the
two-year-old scramble over four and a
half furlongs. . Bozeman could not seem to
keep him going in the first eighth, with
the result that he .finished . third. Honi
ton, ridden by Coniey, and 6 and 7 to 1,
led from the first jump, romping past the
judges five lengths in advance of Ner
vatcr. a 150 to 1 shot.
The Shasta Springs handicap, at six fur
longs, went to Sister Jeanie, a 6 to 1 shot,
carrying 105 pounds' 'and ridden "by L.
Daly. The filly moved away from fourth
position in the stretch, and ridden out,
downed Divina a length In 1:14. Constel
l?.tor ran third, just nosed out for the
place. Donnelly on the favorite, Mee
hanus, handled that horse about as well
as a Chinese section hand does a knife
and fork. He took the worst of a strag
gling start and never had a chance for
a . in." Frank Bell . died away In
front In a fruitless endeavor to carry 113
pounds and win.
For the opening seven-furlong run,
Frank Duffy, a 15 to 1 chance, earned a
nose decision over Elmer L, a 100 . to 1
ehot, piloted by Burlingame. The latter
must have been in pickle, for there was
quite a play on him. HI-Nock-Er ran
third, with the favorite, Anthracite, two
notches farther back. â¢
February enjoyed an easy thing of It
in the slx-furlong selling affair following.
Sixteen to 5 could be had .about the mare
and she galloped home, four lengths in
front of Straggler and Jerid.
AS if Â» bettors had p not already
â¢ enough to contend , with, rain be
gan falling early during the game
, at Oakland yesterday, adding still
further to the discomfiture of
players. â¢ â¢
Lack of transportation facilities on this
side of the bay kept many peopje away, so
thÂ« attendance was only fair. Out of six
favorites sent Into the starter's hands,
only twoâ February and Eonic-rwere re
turned winners. .

SMOOTH-COATED FOX TERRIERS.
THE 'sixth annual show of Â¦ San
Francisco Kennel Club opened
yesterday at Mechanics' Pavilion
under depressing weather condi
' tions. The strike also cast its
baleful influence upon -the exhibition:
Although this" " combination had, a de
pressing effect uoon the attendance, it
could not go beyond that â¢ point, ' as the
show is a success In every other particu
lar. The entries are unusually large in
many classes of the best kennels in the
country. The exhibition is - the most
sightly ever held here, the decorator's art
having been effectively made use of, es
pecially by the California Coursing Com
mittee, which has charge of the splendid
greyhound exhibit, and by the California
Cocker Club. -
The. greyhounds proved the most or
derly of any of the dogs exhibited, not
raising their voices once to Join ! in the
somewhat unmusical chorus of .the other
dogs. The greyhounds were all neatly
blanketed and their section made an in
teresting exhibit of its own. They were
shown in an arcade on the south side of
the Pavilion. This was decorated in red,
while easy chairs r were scattered about in
profusion.
Judging commenced in the morning and
by dusk Judge C. M. Carnochan had en
tirely disposed of the fox terrier awards.
He was^ quick and businesslike in his
work and lived up to his reputation of
being the best judge of that breed in
America.
He awarded the special prize for the
best fox terrier in the show to G. S.
Thomas' wire-haired dog Endcllffe Bris
tles. Â¦ Later in the day he purchased the
dog from Mr. Thomas.
He placed Charles K. Harley's Wandee
Revelry, recently imported, first in the
puppy class for smooth-coated terriers.
Charles Newman's 'Lester C, entered in
the name of Mrs. Newman, was easily
the best of the St. Bernards. : He won the
cup for the best St. Bernard, the.Bush
nell cup for the best St. Bernard bred on
this coast and a special award for the
best St. Bernard owned by' a member of
the Ladles' Kennel Association.- ; '
The programme for to-day follows: -
At 10 a. m.â Dr. George W. Clayton and
John Davidson will continue judging their
respective classes.
2. p. m. â Judging of greyhounds by
George A. Cranfleld.
8 p. m.â Judging of Oriental dogs by
Ho Yow, Imperial Chinese Consul Gen
eral; Major J. L. Rathbone will Judge
packs of hounds, and all the judges, act
ing a3 a jury, will decide upon the best
four from one kennel for the valuable
Cresceus cup. They will also judge. the
best brace of dogs.

last evening was exceptionally good, Tho
programme was as follows:
The Russian Government and church as-
Eume that any one who obstinately per
sists in leaving the orthodox church is
insane or possessed of devils and some
times exercise the right of treating such
persons precisely as madman. Their
property may be placed under a curator
ship and their children under guardian
ship, while they themselves may be im
mured in a monastery until there is evi
dence of restored sanity, that is, until
they declare their willingness to return
to orthodoxy.

RESULTS OF WEDNESDAY'S RACING AT OAKLAND TRACK
VIENNA, April 23.â The comment here
Is generally adverse to the Morgan
steamship combine. The Neuese Weii*er
Journal characterizes it as the first world
trust and says:
The interests of Jhe entire world are opposed
to America monopolizing: the shipping traffic
of the world, or using international navigation
to develop its own export trade and serve its
own political ends. The present organization
contains the root of a still closer combine, of
which America will be the strongest member.
Notwithstanding the fact that Germany is able
to bring into the pool a hundred times the
traffic of America, yet the superior organized
financial power of the Morgan syndicate will
eventually give the United States supreme con
trol From the standpoint of national inter
ests the trust \s the most dangerous conceivable
and it is only natural that the States affected
should watch the development most closely and
take every precaution possible. It may be_ found
necessary to extend the system of State owner
ship to the sphere hitherto left exclusively for
private initiative. -Yet State ownership of the
commercial marine would greatly reduce Its
mobility and give" fresh advantage to America,
which has other means of defending and con
centrating its own interests.

Money for Permanent Improvements.
I have allowed the Police Department, ap
proximately, 100 additional patrolmen, thereby
giving the now overworked men eight-hour
shifts. By this addition to the force the city
can be better patrolled and the lives and prop
erty of citizens afforded more protection. I
have carefully reviewed all the needs of the
department and do not considr that the extra
sergeants and corporals and the $10,000 for a
patrol boat asked for are available or necessary
at this time. The Fire Department has been
similarly treated. I have allowed them â¢suffi
cient appropriation to fill up all the existing
companies with a full complement of men;
The janitors of the City Mall and Hall of
Justice ehould be paid a stipulated salary of
*75 per month, and I have so made provision*.
I would recommend to your honorable hoard
that the police relief and pension fund be bet
ter provided for, in order that the overdraft at
the end of each fiscal year be avoided as much

To the Honorable Board of -Supervisors, City
and County of Saa Francisco â Gentlemen:
Conforming with the charter, I herewith sub

of the municipal government - for the fiscal
year 1902-1903. My estimates are based oh an
assessed valuation of ?*05,000.000 â which I
have every reason to. believe is conservative.
Certain departments are assuming authority tn
their disbursements which should be regulated

Auditor Baehr submitted his estimate of
tlip. probable expenditures of the munici
1>.. '-.government lot the ensuing fiscal year
v-i'-h the Board ot Supervisors yesterday.
'> :.u estimate is based on the requests
; ed with niru by the heads of the various
.jtrartments. As they had asktd for an
amount aggregating more than $9,OO0,0SO
u conduct their ofnees, Baehr was com
pelled to cut down the estimates in order
to bring the total to $5,257,000, and to al
low in addition 5405,000 for permanent im
rrovements, and keep within the dollar
limit of taxation. Baehr also recommends
tuat $300,000 be allowed for the parks ana
Jio.000 for interest and. sinking fund for
the park bonds of 1S74, making a grand
total of $5,9S7.OUO. of which $4,358,500 ts pit>
poi*;d to be raised by a tax of ?LO76i on
every $100 on an assessed valuation of
$405,000,000. The balance of $1,628,500 will
come from other sources. Accompanying
the estimate Auditor Baehr sent the fol
lowing communication to the Board of
Supervisors:

'VICTORIA," B. C, April' 23.â News was
received :by -the steamship Yangtse to
day of an intrigue of the British for the
seizure of the Malay state of Patanf,
Which,' has resulted in the kidnaping of
the Rajah of that State. by the Siamese.
The kidnaping followed his refusal to
Bign a treaty. which gave Slam control of
the State." -' - -. â¢Â¦ Â¦ Â¦' ;â¢Â¦ . :
r j The Â£ British agent in the Malay state
is H. Annadale, who is ostensibly exploit
ing la,. Patani. He had won the^good
graces; of the Rajah, and it seemed as
tlHough his plot would De successful, and
another patch of red added to the Brit
ish map, when Phya Sri Sahadi, Vice
Minister of the Interior, for Siam, took
I a. hand. By dint of the. coup which cul
minated in the kidnaping of the Rajah,

I Patani ; is. still under the i suzerainty of
I Siam. / The Siamese have spies watching
; every -move of Annadale, and two ut
1 tempts-were made to poison him.
i "jTheiRajah was lured to a house in Pa
i tani by the Siamese Minister, and there
! was asked to sign a treaty whereby he
! was "practically to. abjure the right of
1 g'overning'of his own state. It was late at
'night, and there were few of the Rajah's
1 bodyguard' present. These were driven
back by. Siamese soldiers, while others
laid hands on the Rajah and carried him
off to a Siamese gunboat, which was-wait
ing in readiness at a landing near by.
Three attendants were carried-" off with
him, but he was. not allowed to send for
his wife or his cash. The telegraph op
erators, who were in the employ of Slam,
were warned beforehand not to telegraph
news of the kidnaping, and, although the
incident took place on February 20, it was
not until a month later that the news
was received- in Singapore, whither ..it
was carried by messengers.

IT'S FUNNY, how so many' men act.
They toil, and labor, and struggle, Â¦
AND NEVER for a moment 'think of
v rest, or recreation, or pleasure.
AND HOW FOOLISH for those resid-
ing in this vicinity, when right at their
door lies the playground, quickly and
cheaply reached.
IF YOU WILL NOT occasionally give
up the daily grind, - â¢ â¢
DO ' NOT make your wife and children
, continually walk . the treadmill, â¢
AT LEAST give them a chance for a
little change of air that will bring some
color to their cheeks.
PERHAPS then you will find time to
visit them over Sunday,
AND FORGET yourself as your chil-
dren poke grass down your neck,
and in your nose, and eyes, and ears.
GET OUT once in a while and romp,
BREAK AWAY and give your family a
chance to get acquainted with you,
AND CALL or write for

NEW YORK. April 23. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: '
. Stocks were still brisk, and confident to-day,
especially investment - issues.- Consols, which
sold at 94%, gave a good tone to the trading.
Settlements for months past have showed hard
ly any bull account, but this time a small spec
ulative commitment was diclosed, particularly
in Home Rail?.
American stocks repeated the movement, al
though business was much less. They opened
above parities, expecting a scarcity of offerings,
but there was a setback on a general contango
of 4%. with Louisville and Nashville even, St.
Paul even and Canadian Pacific 2. ''
New York sold Atchison, weakening the mar
ket, but in the street New "_ork again support
ed the Coalers, particularly Erie and Reading,
and the close was strong.
Â¦ Copper was % down to Â£52% the ton, and
Rio Tintos were % down to 43%. Gold to the
amount of Â£138,000 bars has been received, as
well as Â£30,000 from Holland. The market was
compelled to borrow Â£1,000,000 from >the bank.

NEW YORK. April 23. â To-day's transfer
of stocks again reached an aggregate of over
1.000,000 shares, but the animation of the
speculation is entirely deteriorated from the
nearly 2,000,000 shares business of Monday.
There was great variety in the dealings . to
day, but the undertone of the market was de
cidedly heavy all day and the advances in
some portions of the list were Insufficient to
clear up the tone. The weather news from
the 'Western grain regions was the central topic
ot discussion.' Prices were successfully turned
upward during the dealings, the grain carriers
sharing fully in the advance. In the tase of
Atchison the opening rise was 1%, but half
.an hour later, when trading began in the grain
markets with prices strongly advancing, these,
stocks gave way. The Government weather
map was sufficient evidence that yesterday's
hopeful estimates of sufficient- rain to undo
any damage already done were not well
founded. The strong rise in the corn market
also helped to depress stocks, notwithstanding
the unlikelihood' of any accurate knowledge at
this time of the chances of the corn crop. But
the evidence at hand from day to day of the
far-reaching effect of last year's corn shortage
is so impressive that the speculative mind will
evidently be very- sensitive' to' the prospect of
the coming crop of that staple. There was a
renewal of the recent active demand for the I
coalers, the Readings again taking the lead
on the supposition that the settlement of the
wage dispute is Imminent. . When, however, it
was perceived that the strength in this section
of the market had little effect in checking the
â¢dribbling liquidation of Western railroad stocks
the movement of the coalers ceased and prices
reacted. Efforts were . made on behalf of the
j large speculative leaders to convey the lmpres-
I sicn that the sharp reaction in prices has been
connived at and furthered by manipulation
with th* purpose of shaking off weak specula
tive followers In preparation for a renewed and
stronger upward movement. The market, In
fact, showed the stronger -technical position
resulting from the liquidation of the weaker
class of the lightly margined account:-. The
pressure to. sell was much less urgent and the
fall in prices not so violent, bat the selling Was
no less persistent and the downward tendency
no less constant. The strength of the sterling
exchange market called renewed attention to
the possibility of po!d exports and revived dis- .
cussion of the present heavily expanded credits.
The provision made for the great steamship
. merger, the coming stock conversion by the
1'nited States Steel Corporation, the provision
for the purchase of the Louisville and Xash
v!lle road and the subscription to the Penn
sylvania bond Jfsu* for $50,000,000; indicate
.nonwvof Â¦the~heavy-re<t*rtrÂ«nepts upon- ..the pres
ent narrow*)} rÂ«ource<= of the money market.
An Incident of the day was a- sharp rally in
Surar of 4>4'on the expressions of confidence
frcm Washington that an agreement would be
reached on the Cuban reciprocity bill. The
stock dofed with a net gain of SVi- Amalga
mated Copper, Tennessee Coal, the Cotton, Oil
end Virginia-Carolina Chemical stocks. Inter
national Silver preferred and a number of
minor specialties were strong. Thera was
strength also among a number of minor rail
road Ftocks on the ground of : their strong
strategic . position. The Wisconsin Central
stocks, the Toledo. St. Lou's and Western '
stocks and the Detroit Southern stocks "were
In this class. The market closed heavy. Con-
Folidated Tobacco 4s were strong and active.
Otherwise the b^nd market was irregular.
Total sales. $4,790,000.
l.'nited States bonds were all unchanged en
the last call.

Repeal of th9 Tea Tax.
Some time ago when the announcement
was made that Congress had repealed tho
Â¦war tax of 10 cents per pound on Import
ed tea, the repeal to go Into effect on and
after January 1. 1903, Customs Collector
Stratton Inquired of the Treasury De
partment whether tea In bonded ware
houses could be withdrawn free of duty
after January 1. 1903, for consumption.
The reply was received yesterday from
the Secretary, of the Treasury to the ef
fect that teas which have been in ware
house not more than three years may be
I withdrawn for consumption free of duty
t after January, 1903.
E More Discharging Inspectors Needed.
-United States Customs - Surveyor Spear
' has asked through Collector Stratton for
an increase of ten discharging Inspectors
In'tfce present force.- Spear urges that thÂ©
enormously, increased business at this
port during ; the past three years renders
the additional heli> a necessity. Â¦

STOCK AND BOND EXCHAJIGE,
The Situation in Wall Street.
CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND
FUTURE PROSPECTS.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"There has been a decided increase in specu
lative activity during the past two weeks. This
could not be entirely attributed to the Louisville
and Nashville incident, though that may have
been a stimulating factor. The principal cause
has been the prospective improvement in mon
etary conditions. Local bank reserves may be
low just now, but the turning point has been
reached; currency will soon return from the In
terior with increasing freedom, relieving the
loan situation from fear of natural stringency
for several months to come. Very likely the
money market will now work along fairly com
fortably until the crop movement begins; as
suming of course that no seriously untoward
events occur during the next three months. The
effect of the recent Russian and Biritlsh loans
upon the international financial markets can be
fairly measured. The former Is not a factor
of importance: the latter will be issued so
gradually as not to produce any material dis
turbance. Possibly at a later date we may ex
port fair amounts of gold to Europe on account
of American investments in consols, but In view
of our large supply of gold and the increasing
production of the same this need cause no un
easinees. The approach of peace, moreover, in
South Africa will stimulate the production of
gold In that quarter, and so tend to divert de
mand from this section; the world's money
markets thus being In an easier condition than
for some time past.
"A -very Important event from the American
point of view was the repeal of the war tax
bill imposed at the outbreak of the war wlih
Spain. This repeal of superfluous taxes will of
course check congestion of funds in the Treas
ury, which had been a serious financial menace
ever since the war closed. The only effectual
means hitherto of releasing funds withdrawn
unnecessarily by taxation was by the purchase
of bonds; a taoet objectionable method, because
it constantly diminished the basis of national
bank circulation, and so forced a further ulti
mate contraction of the currency: to say noth
ing of the folly of the Government paying un
necessarily hiph prices for its own bonds. The
repeal of the war taxes, therefore, removes a
serious element of disturbance, which had It
been allowed to continue would sooner or later
have involved the country in fresh financial
spasms. The avoidance of such a contingency
1e a distinct aid to confidence.
"â¢These two factors, then â the improved
monetary conditions and the passinjr of Louis
ville and Nashville under Morgan control â seem
to have been the signals for a revival of specu
lative, activity, which promises to continue for
some time to come. Many of the big leaders
have returned from their Southern trips; the
large holders ,are known to be favoring an up
ward irovenreat ;. there is an excellent demand
for desira lie Investments, which are scarce and
firmly held: trade conditions are good: railroad
prosperity apjjears unchecked, and so far crop
conditions, ore. iiUilac^u â \Vh*n - the_ Bwer
war iÂ« ever, and the w&Fte of about fJUG.tKXK
OOO yearly stopp*Hi.' thi? country will be the 'bet- 1
ter off; so frill the army of about 15<i.000 men.
a large portion of whom will be released for
productive employment, possibly l:i South
Africa. Tnder such conditions it Is not sur
prising that some of the restless spirits who.
have acquired large wealth may (Ml to dis
tinguish themselves in the stock market. Con
servative operators may not approve of all their
actions, but they are not likely to do otherwise
than quietly eacourafe an upward movement
in the market in spite of the high level of
prices.
â¢'For such reasons I anticipate a much raore
active market. Sharp irrerularitles are likely
to occur because U p situation is not as satis
factory ac a year and realiztions must fol
low; yet there are present a!l the elements nec
essary to active speculation, in vrhlch the rail
roads are entitled to a decided preference. The
Incut-trial* ehould be left severely alone. A keen
outlook must be kept upon the crop situation.
A cood harveFt would insure another year of
general prosperity. A partial failure would
jproduce unwelcome results."

CHICAGO, April 23.â Wheat went booming
from the very start. There were numerous
bullish Incentives and the 'crowd turned bullish
to a. man. Cables started out strong and ad
vanced. This was unexpected and . started the
upturn. Then came the crop damage scare that
set every one buying. The rains in the winter
wheat belt yesterday, though enough to allay
tho heat, were reported far from' sufficient to
savo crops. Added to this came the weather
report that freezing temperatures would- prob
ably be reached in some sections of the South
we-t to-night. Receipts also were exceedingly
llg. I and argued rapidly decreasing stocks.
Higher outside markets augmented the upturn.
Reports, both Government and private, - per
sisted in the advice that . the . crops were being
badly- damaged. The -millers' association of
Kansas- reported the crop . of . that State at a
condition of ">tj. Indiana wafe said to be suffer
ing and advices stated that from. 20 to 25 per
cent of. the sown fields would be plowed up.
There was a lot of liquidation for profits on
the early advance, but commission house buying
started renewed spurts. .The wheat traders
were seriously aroused over the critical condi
tion of the crop and bought with the convic
tion that there "was money in it." Trade was
enormous, possibly as large as on the big bull
campaign last December. . There was practical
ly no time when the market was not advanc
ingâand at big jumps. May opened ] 4@%'c
up at 74%Sf"5c and soared to uc, closing very
streng and excited, 2 VÂ»c up, at 70%c. Â¦ '
j Corn had the influence of . the wheat boom
to start it advancing, but the real bull incen
tive in j this pit - mi the renewed heavy buy
ing by the big commission houses, which. It
was reported several weeks ago. were trying
to corner July options. Wall street is said to
be behind this crowd and as the big lines were
accumulated "tailers" followed and bought
feverishly. The market . was strongest at the
close. May closed strong, 2%c up at 64%c. -
Oats were strong, throughout the session on
the influence of the strength in the other grains
May closed l%c up at 41%c. - ..
Hog products had a strong and advancing
market, influenced by a steady hog market and
the grain bulge. May i>ork dosed 30c higher-
May lard 17%c up, and May ribs I5Â®i ( yÂ»c
Wghor. â¢ '
Â¦/The leading futures ranged as follows:
Barley and Corn doing belter in sympathy' with Wheat. ; ; â¢
Oats firm, in sympathy with the other grains. Rye still dull.
Hay soft, owing to the showers. Bran and Middlings unchanged.

The weather was decidedly unfavorable over
the. wheat area yesterday: and Chicago reflected
it by advancing from 74% c to 76%c. The mar
ket' was 'very (stiff, with light "offerings. South
west damage (reports were more numerous and
emphatic. Buying was excellent, the Southwest
purchasing ': heavily, .. St. â¢ Louis leading. The
Southwestern \ exporters"' were also liberal buy
ers. Minneapolis reported. stocks there decreas
ing at the rate of 100,000 bushels per day.
The weather was cool and cloudy at Chicago
and clear : in the . West, with frosts predicted
over a -large 1 area. It Â¦ was : this that gave the
ginger to the market. showers
turned out light, one-third of an inch being the
.heaviest fall anywhere. There was a foot of
snow in the Red River Valley and the Western
and Southwestern showers were followed by
frost and cold high winds. > .'

Fight for Chairmanship.
While the. Republicans/ of the State who
are battling for good principles and party
success have not united on. a candidate
to oppose the Gage machine, they have,
by common consent, decided to support
Hon. Jacob H. Neff of Placer for chair
man of the convention. The friends of
Preston, Flint. Pardee, Ed son. Short and
Outter are willing to trust Governor Neff,
knowing that he will not take orders
from Burns and Herrin. George Knight is
recognized as Gage's candidate for chair
man of the convention. No doubt manv
delegates will be instructed to vote for
Governor >*eff and some may gret Instruc
tions to support Knight. The Gage
manipulators will not be able to pro
gramme the ticket from top to bottom If
the convention organizes by electing Xeff
chairman.
The manner of electing delegates to
represent the cities of San Francisco. Los
Ansetes, Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley,
Pasadena, Vallejo, San Diego, San Jose,
Sacramento. Fresno and Stockton is set
forth in the primary election law and can
not be changed by the committee. Poli
ticians of the Gage machine expected
early in the campaign that the Supreme
Court would overthrow the law but the
force of public sentiment in favor of the
act impelled the bosses to change their
tactics. It is quit* well understood that
the workers attached to the Gage ma
chine will do whatever they can under
cover to encourage the appointment of
delegates by county committees. There
is, however, in the executive committee
a strong sentiment In favor of the prin
ciple of requiring all - delegates to be
chosen â¢ by primary elections, j The Gage
men talk of a compromise plan, by which,
each county may decide the question for
itself. The decision would" "be" rendered,
of course, by the county committee. It
is in the power of the State Central Com
mittee to recognize the people or refuse
to them recognition. The reference
of the issue to the counties would have
no other result than a big crop of con
testing delegations. There is more at
stake than the office of Governor, Repre
sentatives in Congress and Justices of the
Supreme Court are to be nominated. What
is wanted Is a fair deal and a chance for
all Republican voters to participate in the
election of delegates to the convention-
Voters will resent county committee ap
pointments by holding primaries and elect
ing ether lelegrates. The issue vill thus
be passed up to the convention's commit
tee on credentials. .
Oppose Appointment of Delegates.
Questions touching the methods of se
lecting delegates to the convention will
eurely be considered. There is an earnest
desire upon the part of Republican vot
ers of the State for opportunity to par
ticipate In the election of delegates. De
nial of this opportunity will subject the
committee to deserved censure and pro
voke discord in the party. i
The executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee will meet
at the Palace Hotel next Monday even
ing. General George Stone, chairman of
the party organization, yesterday gave
directions for calling the members of the
committee together. Important business
will be considered at the session. The
members of the committee who do not
live in San Francisco are: Charles N. Fel
ton, San Mateo; William Barr, San Ra
fael; Douglass "S. Cone. . Red Bluff;
E. C. vHart. Sacramento; Allen
B. Lemmon, Santa Rosa; W. M. Cut
ler, Marysville; J. W. McKinley, Wal
ter F. Parker and J. S. Slaussen, Los An
geles, and C. S. Hardy, San Diego.
A time will be fixed for a general meet
ing of the entire State committee, at
which meeting the time and place of hold-'
Ing the State nominating convention will
be designated.
The recommendations agreed upon by
the executive committee at the meeting
Monday evening next may be ratified by
the State committee.
Gage Manipulators Hope That the
County Governing Bodies May Be
Authorized to Appoint Dele
gates to State Convention.
Several Important Matters
Will Be Taken Up for
Consideration.
In the sack which contained the tools
Detective Reynolds found a memorandum
book In which there was some data, from
which he expects to gain a clew to the
bold operators. What he Â¦ learned from
the book he would not divulge. Â¦_/Â¦'
The police believe that a gang of Chi
cago safe-crackers have' recently arrived
in the city and that this is their first at
tempt at doing a job. The locality chosen
is an especially dangerous Â¦ one, ae it is
well guarded at night time by watchmen,
as. .large sums of. money are always .on
hand in the offices of business men in that
section. The' acquaintance with the prem
ises shown by the burglars evidences ex
treme care in their preparations and
marks them as particulanly dangerous in
this line of work. /Everr effort will be
made to apprehend themj and it is be
lieved that they- will either be caught or
else compelled to leave the dtv before
they can secure another kit of tools and
resume operations.- ' Â¦
Â¦ No locks "were .broken on the doors to
either of the ; offices and it is supposed
that.-the . burglars; gained- entrance- to the
room -by* climbing through the windows
from -;the .adjoining building. I The win
dows were raised, which ' is an unusual
occurrence in the office, and none of the
clerks or proprietors can recall that they
were left open at the close of business
the evening before.
The detectives found that the safe
crackers had gone about their work with
the utmost deliberation. They had at
tached a peculiar kind of. lamp to the
electric light wires- in the room and by
the rays of this they bored four holes
Into the safe door. There is a high de=k
in the, room alongside the, safe which
kept the light from showlng^at the tran
som or at the windows. % *

William Henderson, the janitor of the
building, discovered the attempted crime
at 4:30 in the morning. He had come to
his work slightly earlier than usual and
opened the outer door of Johnson & Hig
gins'. office with his passkey. He passed
into the inner office and was startled to
find the door of the safe swung open and
a quantity of drills, braces, bits, feeders
and other burglar tools scattered" around
on the floor. A glance convinced him that
the inner door to the safe was still intact.
He went ; downstairs at once and found
Special Policeman Wigmore, who is em
ployed as watchman on the block. Word
was telephoned to police headquarters and
a patrol wagon with Detectives Reynolds
and Armstrong went immediately to the
place.
Janitor Hakes the Discovery.
The outfit of safe-cracking tools re
covered by the police at the scene of the
attempted job is worth, commercially, at
least >500. and is the finest and most com
plete ever captured in : this city. Every
tool that criminal ingenuity could devise
to expedite and lighten the work of open
ing vaults, and all of them of the finest
workmanship, comprised the collection.
In addition to these there was a strong
electric battery, capable of generating a
current that would instantly melt steel
bars. The tools completely filled a large
gunnysack and were the object of mucji
interest from detectives at police head
quarters.
Beyond the inner door of the safe lay
over $8000 In gold coin and negotiable se
curities valued at more than $16,000. With
the outfit possessed by the safe 'crackers
another half-hour would have put them
within reach of this treasure and they
would have escaped with the plunder. The
tools are the only evidence through which
their identity may become known.
Seme accidental and unexplained inter
ference early yesterday morning prevent
ed one of the most daring and sensational
safe-cracking exploits that has occurred
in this city within recent years. An at
tempt was made to gain entrance to the
safe of Johnson &- Higgins, insurance
brokers, on the second floor of the build-
Ing at 315 California street, some time
after midnight. The outer door of the
safe was bored through and . the bars to
the lock melted in twain by a powerful
electric battery. One hole was started in
the inner door, but for some unaccount
able reason the burglars did not complete
their work/

a Divorce on Ground

SAYS HIS WIFE
HUMILIATED HIM
Braun admitted that he had been steal
ing at every opportunity for several
months past, and gave the detectives in
formation which led to the recovery of a
large amount of the loot. A violin valued
at $300, which was -stolen from Dr.
Kadesky of Alameda on March 28, was re
covered and also about $1000 worth of
surgical instruments and dental supplies.
In Braun's rooms at the Golden West
was a large amount of clothing and other
plunder which he had taken from restau
rants and theaters. Nearly everything
that was movable . looked good, to him.
and he admits plying his trade at every
opportunity. Altogether there are about
f^?'^ eparate thefts, the responsibility for
which he has acknowledged. It is thought
by^the police that he has a criminal rec
ord elsewhere. Nearly all of the stolen
articles will eventually be recovered.
â¢ Braun . dressed well, lived the easy life
of a man about town and roomed in com
lortabie. apartments at the Golden West
.Hotel. Since tne iirst-of the year com
piaints have ' been coming in to police
Headquarters ot articles missing from
dentists' and doctors' offices, and always
accompanying tnese was a description of
a wen-tirussed stranger of affabie man
ner, who â¢ when askea his business would
inquire where he could secure the serv
ices or a trained, nurse, j It wasn't a nurse
he needed, but a policeman. - Â¦ -' â¢ -
On April 7 a suit case containing dental
supplies, to the value of Iol3ua was stolen
from an office in San Jose. The supplies
belonged, to J. W. Rooch, 916 Market
street, and he made a report to the San
Francisco police. Detectives Kyan a*id
O'Day succeeded in locating some of this
stuff in a pawnshop, and -the description
given of the seller tallied with that of the
man in search of a nurse. He told the
pawnbroker he had some more stuff to
sell, and the detectives shadowed the
place - for three days_ waiting for the
thief's return. He did not come back,
but he went to Oakland yesterday and
called on a doctor, who became suspicious
and "telephoned Chief Hodgkins, what
placed the suspect under arrest. Word
was telephoned to the detective depart
ment of this city and Detectives Kyan.
and O'Day. brought the prisoner across
the bay. .
Swell bets on the ponies and a love for
fast life are the inducing: causes given by
Martin Braun for becoming a thief. For
three months or more he has been looting
the private offices of dentists and doctors,
and has secured in that space of time
plunder to the amount of $300<).
