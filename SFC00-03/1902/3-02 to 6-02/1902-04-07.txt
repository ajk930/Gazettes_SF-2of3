/ *W * Sunday to-day. Though there
*' were degrees of'dryness, so
to speak, in different sections
ef the metropolis, the day has had no
equal in the suspension of the liquor
traffic since five years ago, when Superin
tendent Thomas F. Byrnes closed the sa
loons, one memorable Sunday. On that
occasion those seeking spirituous refresh
ment were compelled to resort to places
outside of Chief Byrnes' sphere of influ
ence. â¢..-.Â¦;â¢ . '
His task, however. Is said to have been
easier than that which confronted: the po
lice to-day, for he had no Raines law ho
tels, -with their sandwiches, to contend
"with. These hotels must be taken Into
consideration, therefore, when the word
"dry" is used In . connection with .the
events of to-day, for. the man: who had
money to buy a sandwich and a drink had
6mall difficulty, in slaking his thirst. Few
liquor dealers had the temerity to keep
open and serve drink alone, and of. those
who did a .majority were invited to. the
nearest police station, there to remain "un
til bondsmen appeared.

Only one alleged violator of the excise
laws was found to-day by. the lynx-eyed
officers; only two or three Raines law ho

eaw that the law was Closely observed.

Special Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON, April 6,â Whitelaw Reid
and the members of his special embassy
to . the coronation of King Edward "VII
have decided to pay their expenses out
of their own pockets. When Reid went
to London as special embassador of the
United States to the diamond jubilee of
Queen Victoria- he was provided with an
expense fund of 510,000, appropriated by
Congress. Four thousand dollars of this
amount was turned back into the treasury
by Reid, who according to reliable infor
mation spent $20,000 out . of his private
purse to keep up the dignity of an Ameri
can representative. â¢ \ -
- When the- diplomatic - and consular ap
propriation bill was under consideration
the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions contemplated attaching to the .bill
an amendment appropriating money for
the expenses of a special embassy to the
coronation, but on Inquiry at -the State
Department was , informed ' by Secretary
Hay, that it was not necessary, in view
of the decision of Reid and his attaches
to personally pay all bills contracted on
their mission abroad.
The expenses -of Brigadier General
James H. Wilson, the army Â¦ representa
tive, and Captain Chkfles E. Clark, the
naval representative, and their aids will
be paid out of the offlcEal contingent fund.
RARE CANVASBACKS NOT
TO PRINCE HENRY'S LIKING
'BERLIN, April 6.â General vori Trotha,
Emperor "William's, adjutant, who was
asked at "a dinner party what he really
thought of Prince Henrj''e visit to the
United States said: -
"I; have ; been to .entertainments at the
principal courts ;of Europe and I - have
never seen such luxury and good taste as
shown at the Â¦, series of, banquets and re
ceptions in America, Nowhere Is there
such an exquisite cuisine."' â¢ -
Referring to'American- dishes, the gen
eral said none of the party liked canvas
back duck â¢ because it- was served almost
red, but Prince Henry, ordered It at the
farewell luncheon on. board the Deutsch- ;
land. to please his American guests. The
German cooks,, however, produced â¢ the
canvasbacks well done, wnlch the Ameri
cans did not. like, but which the Prince's
party 'on this occasion didlike. All the
royal party liked terrapin.
Professor Muentersberg, who enter-'
tained the Prince's, party at , Harvard
writes to Die Woche his impressions of
the'trip, under. the title of>VA MoraJ Con
quest." concluding thafthough the 'United
States -was delighted, with the Prince he
was also deeply fascinated by the United

There have been several meetings of the
growers lately, and at each one of them
there have not been enough members of
the association to form a quorum. Upon
to-morrow's meeting hinges the future of
the association. It Â¦will then be decided who
are to be the association's officers for the
next yea_r. The nominations for the board
of directors have all been made, and
Kearney is not one of the nominees. And
this t too. has given rise to a great deal
of feeling.. But the bitterest feeling of all
has been created by the altitude taken
by Kearney toward the meeting to-mor
row. He holds office at a salary of $6000
a year under the old contract, which still
has one year to run. unless it shall in
the meantime be suspended by the general
signing of the new contract. In case the
new directors are not elected, which can
be prevented only by the failure to secure
a quoruw to-morrow, he will continue in
his presen* capacity, in which, however
he has consented to eerve without salary.
Petitions signed by business men and
by the Fresno Chamber of Commerce
Â£ave been sent^tp every grower in, the
district, urging him to be present at the
meeting. The business men are solid

50 per cent of the growers to the new
lease, but this was not sufficient, and the'
association had to handle the greater part
of the crop under Â«the contract - of the
previous year. The discussion has at last
come "down to one of Kearney or the as
sociation. A targe number â¢ of the grow
ers now assert that if Kearney continues
as the president of the association, , there
â¢will be no association. Kearney's friends
say that no one else in rlie country is
capable of conducting the work, and that
without Kearney there can be no asso
ciation. - - - - -
Association Is in Peril.
The season of 1900-1901 was one In which
harmony prevailed and. prosperity seemed
to be settling upon the raisin grower. A
new contract had been formed, and 92 per
cent of the growers had -been Induced to
Eign. Good prices had been obtained for
all the raisins. But friends of this con
tract were displeased . when a. . new con
tract operating- under the corporation
laws of the State of New Jersey was
drawn up. This contract was a lease by
each grower of his vineyard to the direc
tors of the association. The directors had
complete control of the vineyard, it being
within their power to say just how it
ehould be plqwed, pruned, cultivated. and
cared for generally. It also provided that
one-half a cent a pound of all money re
ceived for raisins should go into the treas
ury of the association, the object being,
as President Kearney explained, to get
a fund for the erection of growers' pack
ing-houses, distilleries, etc., not to be
built unless it became necessary to do so
iaorder to control the packers^
U"he new lease met with very little fa
vor. There was still a. quarter of a. mil
lion dollars due growers from the pre
vious season's crop, and a large quantity
cf raisins still unsold. President Kearney
was in Europe. Cablegrams and letters
arrived from him often, urging the grow
ers to sign the Dew lease. When he re
turned to New York he kept the wires
busy with long dispatches to the grow
ers here, and said that he would smash
the Eastern market and sell raisins at 2
cents. The statement had no effect in
inducing signatures, and so. the associa
tion president preceded to carry it into
effect to the extent of cutting prices to
about 2^4 cents.- He asserts it was done
in order to preserve the association and
to prevent the growers outside of the as
sociation from getting: better prices for
their raisins than the association mem
bers. His opponents took a * different
view, asserting it was merely a method
of attempting to coerce the growers.
Cause of the Dispute.
Then -came discord. Outside -growers
dealt with outside packers and managed
to secure even better rates than the as
sociation was able to obtain. The asso
ciation grower deplored the fact that he
belongedtto an association that gave him
but 5 cents for his raisins when his neigh
bor was getting 5% cents. At a meeting
two years ago President Kearney, ten
dered ,his resignation. He was, . however,
induced to accept the position again.
Peace and hafmony have never existed'
among the members of the Raisin Grow
ers' Association. When it was first or
ganized four years ago. 75 per cent of the
growers were members, j and out of the
demoralized conditions of the 'previous
years, when growers were haying hard
-work to secure 1 cent per pound for rai
sins in the sweat box, it rose to sufficient
power to demand from the packers 5 cents
per pound, and got it. All the plans were
carried out by the board of directors of
the association with M.- Theodore Kearney
at the head.
the association, one working strenuously
to secure a quorum, and the other work
ing just as strenuously to prevent it. At
the head cf this second faction is Presi
dent Kearney. The leaders of the other
faction are C. Gaincs, D. D. Allison, Rob
ert Boot, and other well-known growers,
besides many outside parties.

It is argued that it is. not altogether im
probable that this lieutenant or any other
leader of an expedition starting from the ;
head of the Gulf of California should have
"stumbled onto a new river flowing in a
direction which was against his ideas of
the lay of the land and that he should
have determined; to follow it up. Later,
when Ms command reached the desert and'
saw the river sink into the^feands or dis
appear beneath the hot sun, it is believed
plausible that he should have returned to
the spot where the ruins are. found and
there built the fort.
That the fort was built hundreds of
years ago is made practically certain by
the size of the mesquite trees growing
in the moat which had evidently been dug 1
about the fort when it was built. * ' "
There are traditions among the Indians
xtt the -desert; which date-back' to the com
ing of the mission fathers,' and many of
them indicate the . possibility, if not the
probability, of the story j as conjectured
by the searchers. Indeed, one of the tra
ditions \is of the departure of an expedi
tion from the head of the Gulf of Cali
fornia going in a northwesterly direction.
Tbe tradition says that the entire expedi
tion was overpowered by the savages. and
perished, save a priest, who was- trans
lated to heaven without suffering death.
Everything about the ruins, including
the charred and almost buried death
stake, would indicate that it was some
centuries since that fort was dismantled
and destroyed by whatever adversaries
the Mexican-Spanish people found there.
History tells of one of the lieutenants o'f
Alacon, an early Spanish explorer, who
'.wandered from the main expedition, then
exploring In the region which has since
become New Mexico and Arizona; and
who was never heard from.
The discovery of the ' stake was j made
by S. DV Yokem and the researches since
have, been carried on by Dr. J. W. Oak
ley. The charred pest pf mesquite wood
was only a short distance' below. the sur
face of the desert sand ana near by were
the charred bones and teeth of a supposed
victim. Among the bones were found a
number of glass beads,. colored blue and
'-white, and . a crucifix of white glass, all
of which had been melted. The argument
is made that those who destroyed the. fort
and killed Its' defenders found, there a
priest, who, being a non-combatant, had
escaped death in the defense; but found
it later at the stake only a' short distance
away. . . Â¦ -'Â¦- - . Â¦Â¦" ' Â¦â¢ Â¦ â¢
SAN DIEGO;; April - 6.â A discovery, in
the eastern part of the county; which is
receiving mych attcndon of late. Is that
of ah old fort about eight or nine milÂ«s
west of Imperial, the new desert town,
which is the head of the Imperial colony.
Interest his been heightened by the more
recent finding of what, was probably the
stake at which one or more' of the people,
who built the fort and fought it, may
have- been sacrificed; .;, .... ; :

The men secured Carter, took him a
half-mile north of the village, hanged
him to a tree and fired thirty-five bullets

the Republicans, both in cau
cus and in the Committee on Ways and
Means, will be fought on the floor of the
House this week. The ultimate passage
of the Payne bill, providing for a 20 per
cent reduction on the products of Cuba
after the negotiation of a reciprocity
treaty and the enactment of our immigra
tion laws by the republlcof Cuba,' is re
garded as a foregone conclusion, but the
situation is a complicated one, owing to
the divisions among the j Democrats as
well as the Republicans. How far the
Republican opponents of the proposed leg
islation will carry their objection is not
determined. The strength of this opposi
tion has dwindled until it probably num
bers less than thirty. On the other hand,
up to the present time a large majority
of the Democrats favor the greatest pos
sible freedom of trade with Cuba and
would vote for a deeper cut than the
Ways and Means bill proposes. Others,
like Newlands of Nevada', are In favor of
the immediate annexation of the island,,
and, under the leadership of the Louisi
ana members, will oppose strenuously any
tariff concessions whatever. It is hinted
that the attitude of the Democrats in the
Senate who have fixed on a programme of â¢
opposition there may result, before s,the

While some'of these amendments might
command some Â¦ Republican votes if, they
should actually come to a /vote,, they will
be ruled- out of: order in* the House as
they were in committee, and the only
method by which they can be reached
would be by overruling the decision of the

The real fight will come'probably.whcn
the bill Is read for amendment under the:

Democrats will seek to offer amendments

of the whole tariff question.
Some of the Republican opponents of the
bill will speak against ft, Â»but the leaders
of the Republican opposition show a
strong disinclination to participate in Ihe
debate, on the ground that there is no
hope of defeating the bill and that their
speeches would become Democratic cam
paign material in the coming Congres
sional campaign. Thebill will be brought
up on Tuesday as a revenue bill, which is
priveleged under the rules, but no spe
cial order will be brought in for its con
sideration. In this way the possibility
of a defeat of a rule through a combina

The Daily Telegraph to-day announces
that Emperor William and President
Roosevelt both received an intimation
from the trustees of Mr. Rhodes' estate
as to what the will proposed before that
document was made public. The Presi
dent and the Emperor intimated to the
trustees, according to the Telegraph their
pleasure at and approval of the legacies
in a friendly cablegram.
The Times, in an editorial on the recep
tion of Rhodes' plan abroad, says: "it
Is unnecessary to discuss the political as
pects of the scheme as Is indicated by
Mr. Rhodes' aspirations for a better un
derstanding between England, Germany
and the United States; but it cannot be
doubted that the effect on Oxford will be
far-reaching. The influx of Americans
and Germans will tend to quicken the in
tellectual life."
Dr. Stevenson of Exeter College said he
thought the plan would bring Oxford good
athletes and enable the university to
achieve -the much desired object of van
quishing Cambridge in athletics.
The dean of New 1 College said he con
sidered Â£300 ample, even: if the student
had to maintain himself the year round,
but he said that Cecil Rhodes had fallen
Into the same error- as most educational
benefactors in " forgetting that the uni
versity needed an endowment quite as
much as the scholars.
Dr. Esson of Merton, Professor Smith,
history tutor of Balll6l, and others wel
comed the idea heartily.'
"It will giveithe scholars," . said .'. Dr.
McGrath, "time to assimiliate with the
mass, and it will' prevent- undue herding
with their own kin.'.' - ... >... V~;
Dr Moberly, canon of Christ Church
College, spoke in eloquent terms of the
plan. It "would, he said, bring picked men
of the best type of Americans, rather
than the wealthy Americans who had
heretofore come to Oxford mainly for
social advantages. , .
Mr. Skane, bursur of Christ Church
College, said that if the yearly allow
ance of Â£3tÂ» were merely for the yearly
semester, it would enable the scholar to
live comfortably, but if it were intended
to include also vacation expenses, the
balance left for the university would ren
der It inadvisable that the beneficiary of
the scholarship come to Christ Church.
Dr. McGrath, the popular provost of
Queen's College, was emphatic in his pre
dictions of future good arising for Oxford

which there was a landlord's lien, besides
a lot of mortgages upon real estate, the
receiver declares there are many . out
standing notes which he could not get
hold of. It appears, saya the receiver,
that the company loaned $2300 to A. W.
Kratzar, a stockholder and director of
the company, which was secured by a real
estate mortgage. The receiver say3 on
this point:
"The receiver Is informed that these
notes, by order of George Copland, one
of the directors and stockholders and at
that time secretary of the company, were
sent and surrendered to said Kratzar
without any consideration therefor and
the only claim against said Kratzar in
lieu of said notes, as the receiver Is In
formed, 13 simply a charge against him on
the books Â¦ of the company for said
amount. - â¢
"It further appears.'.' says the receiver,
"that there has been Issued to different
directors and officers of the company
large amounts of certificates and coupons
of said Investment "company and for the
payment of dues upon which said officers
have simply executed their notes and
never paid any cash into the ' company.
The transactions in this regard with the
company would exceed $100,000." â¢

Fourteen investments companies, which
have been running -here for -from three
to eight years and gathered in from Ken

J3.000.000. are j on the verge of collapse.
The money came from poor people, who

The companies, in many Instances, prom

Several horses were killed in the battle.
To-night it is rumored that the Sheriff
and his brother cannot live. So deadly
was the negro's aim that it was- possibly
sun hour before the body. of Prout could
be recovered.- Xot a shot fired by Rey
nolds failed to count when those he was
firing upon could be plainly seen by him.
The excitement to-day was intense, but
there is no fear of an uprising among
the negroes. Fully 3000 people from Flor
ence and Sheffield were here and every
surgeon in the two towns was pressed
Into service.
Relic seekers cut off the negro's fingers
and such parts of the body as could be
procured.
Three houses were burned in the effort
to reach the negro.
Wallace, who was killed, was closing In
on the negro, who shot him through the
body. His body fell In the burning debris,
but was recovered. Davis, Wallace and
Falkner were the men who fired the build
ing.
Coal oil was then procured and after
four hours of hard work the houses ad
joining that In which the negro was lo
cated were fired. About 8 o'clock the
house In which the negro was located
was fired by the "Wheeler Rifles, who had
arrived on the scene. The negro took ref
uge in a shed and opened fire, killing Wal
lace and wounding Davis, but the people
and some militiamen riddled the negro.
The crowd, numbering 1000 people, grab
bed the body and threw it into the burn
ing building. . .
As soon us possible every man In town
who could procure a gun was In the
neighborhood, but owing to the location
none dared to venture within the open
space. Dynamite was procured and the
house in which the negro was barricaded
was fired uyon, but to no effect. At 1
o'clock Captain Simpson of the Wheeler
Rifles arrived with twelve grins and 1000
cartridges, which were distributed among
twelve picked men. This company was
stationed around the house and riddled
It, but the negro had taken refuge In the
cellar and returned the fire, killing Jones
and wounding Flnney.
This morning at 11 o'clock Sheriff
Cassaway went to a negro settlement,
"Knardstown," to arrest Will Reynolds

The inclusion of Germany in Rhodes'
alms, as set forth In his will, has brought
out some considerate expressions con
cerning his imperial purposes from even
the Anglophobe journals, although most
of the commentators on his purpose hold
him responsible for the Boer war.
"Why, I have not such a Minister!"
Emperor William is said to have ex
claimed after an Interview with Cecil
Rhodes in 1889. This remark is widely
reproduced and enables the opposition
paragraphists to revile the present Min
istry. ' V* -
It was then pointed out to the Emperor
that while Rhodes had left precise .direc
tions as to the selection of the beneficiaries
of the Rhodes scholarships In other coun
tries, the selection of the beneficiaries of
the lifteen scholarships set aside for Ger
many had been left to the discretion of
Emperor William. '--Â¦".-
The bequests of Rhodes are regarded at
court as constituting an enduring Impulse
to good fueling between Germany, Ureat
Britain and the United States and the
colonies of these countries, and as giving
more substance to the grouping of the
Teutonic powers.
â¢The earth belongs to the vital, living
peoples, and these snould act as one when
inefficient powers check advancement,"' is
another utterance attributed to the Ger
man Emperor when his Majesty was
speaking of Prince Henry's trip and the
need of a better understanding with the
United States.
BERLIN, April 6. â "This bequest shows
the wide range of Cecil Rhodes' mind and
his vision of the future," said Emperor
William to Dr. von Lucanus, the chief of
his Majesty's Civil Cabinet, who alluded
to the will of Mr. Rhodes during an audi
ence with the Emperor yesterday morn

WASHINGTON. Aorll 6.â The Catholic
University was the scene to-day of a bril
liant ceremony In honor of the jubilee of
the Poue. The fact that Pope Leo is the
founder of the university, made the occa
sion one In which the professors, students
and friends took great delight. .The Right
Rev. Rector Bishop Conaty officiated In a
pontifical mass.
; The" sermon was preached by the "Very
Rev.- Edmund T. Shanahan, dean of the
faculty of theology. The sermon was an
analysis of the contributions of Leo XIII
to the solution of the great intellectual,
moral, social, democratic; . Industrial \ and
religious problems of the past century. *
The students of Georgetown College
adopted resolutions of joy on the event
celebrated by Catholics to-day and sent a
congratulatory message to the Pope.
The Cardinal then related a number of
incidents which had Â¦ come under his per
sonal observation during his association
with the Pope, tending to show his strik
ing personality, his courtly manner and
marked ability as a younger man and
the wonderful clearness of his Intellect
and excellence of hi3 memory at the pres
ent time, in spite of his 9.0 years. .
A conflict between labor and capital . Is as
unreasonable as would be a contention between
the head and the hands. The Interests cf cap
ital and labor are correlative." Capital without
labor will be unproductive; labor without capi
tal would be unprofitable. What would it avail
a capitalist to say: "Behold, . this mountain of
coal is mine" if there, were no hardy sons of
toll to extract the coal from its recesses and
send it to the market? â¢ What would it profit
the laborer to exhibit- his brawny arm and his*
skill if there were no capitalists to give him
employment? Â¦ -Â¦ â¢ ~ -
The third encyclical, to which I shall allude,
appeared In 1885 and treats of the "Constitu
tionality of the Christian States." In this
document the Holy Father clearly demonstrates
that the Catholic church can adapt itself to all
forms of civil government.
The encyclical on' "The Condition of Work
men" was promulgated in- 1801 and is an ex
haustive document on the rights and duties of
the laboring classes. Never did the Redeemer
of mankind confer a greater temporal blessing
on humanity than by ennobling and sanctify
ing. manual labor and by rescuing it from the
degeneration which has been attached to It.
Christ comes Into the world not surrounded by
the pomp and splendor, of an Imperial majesty,
but he appears as the reputed son of an arti
san. "Is not this the carpenter, the son of
Mary?" the people said to him.- He hai shed
a halo around the workshop and has lightened
the workman's tools by assuming the trade of
an artisan. If the professions of a soldier, of
a Jurist, or of a prelate can be dignified by the
examples -of a "Washington, a Carroll and a
Taney. how much more is the calling of a
mechanic ennobled by the example of Christ?
The -first encyclical to which I shall alludo
is on Christian marriage, which was published
in 18S0. The Holy Father vindicated in strong
and earnest language, the unity, the sanctity
and the lndissolubility of the marriage bond.
He tells us that Â¦ the married couple are the
source of the family, the family is the source
of society. Social life cannot be maintained in
Its. purity and Integrity unless it la sanctified
at the fountain head of the' home.

PERSONAL MENTION.
,The British cruiser Hermes Is* a notable sample_of "defec
tive design or. workmanship of engines. . in that navy. She
was commissioned October 5, 1899, and served one year and two
months on the â¢ North Atlantic station, during which time it
required $20,000 for j repairs . to her machinery. " Returning to
England,. she is now beirig overhauled at an estimated cost of
5182,000, of which- $100,000 la for machinery. The first cost of
the Hermes was $1,184,240, exclusive of armament, and the re
pairs, therefore, equal 17 per cent In one year of the original cost.'
It is frequently charged' ithat United States naval vessels are
copies of British designs,' and it is true that the Charleston, Bal
tlmorei Philadelphia and Yorktown were built from English
plans, yet the average repairs of those ships was about 3.3 per
cent I for, three years "after their first commission, and the
larger part went toward repairs of hulls, hence these vessels

The naval review at Spithead on the occasion of King Ed

of the British navy and 20 vessels of -other nationalities will
be present. At the review in 1856. after the close of the Cri
mean war, there .were about 250 vessels, but of these 140 were
gunboats and 60 . mortar-boats. In 1887 the fleet numbered 109
vessels, and in 1897 there were. 165. present, including 13 non

carrying Â£ crew of thirty, of .which ten were crossbow men.
The second Queen was the first three-decker launched in Queen
Victoria's reign. The ship was .one of many designed by Rear
Admiral Sir William Symonds, surveyor \>t the navy from 1832
to 1847, and was launched at Portsmouth May 15, 1839. She waa
of 3240 tons, old measurement, and 4800 tons displacement. Her
length on gun 'deck was 2*7 feet 6 Inches,' length on water line
204 feet 7 Inches, extreme breadth 59 feet 2% inches and ex
treme draught 26 feet % Inch. The height above water of bow
was 35 feet, at stern 38 feet, the lower port side 6% feet and
the main truck was 190 feet above "the water line. She car
ried an armament of one hundred 32-pounders and ten 68
pounders, weighing, with ammunition, 311 tons, and the weight
of her all-around fire was 3680 pounds. Her total cost was
$572,460. Soon. 'after " her return from the Crimean war the
Queen, with a number of other sailing ships of the line, was
fitted with auxiliary screw engines of about 2000 horsepower.
The experiment was a failure and. good ships were spoiled.
Like the rest of England's "wooden walls," the old Queen has
gone into the wood pile and disappeared. The new Queen is
of 15,000 tons displacement, 400 feet length, 75 feet beam and 27
feet draught, carrying four 12-inch, j eight 7%-inch, eight 6-inch,
eighteen 12- pounders, six 3-pounders and eight Maxim guns.
The weight of shells filed from the four 12-lnch guns Is 3400
pound3,*against, the- combined all-around fire of the old Queen's
one hundred and ten guns of 3680 pounds. The estimated total
cost of the battleship just launched is about $5,500,000.

The cruiser Minneapolis, in ordinary at League Tsland, Is
to be fitted up as a receiving ship to take the place of the old
Richmond; which latter will be towed to the Norfolk navy
yard. The Minneapolis is a sister ship to the Columbia, re
cently converted into a receiving ship at the Brooklyn yard,
and was launched August 3, 1S93. Her first cost was J3.840,
996 44 and the repairs foot up to $127,653 78 to July 1, 1901.
Neither of the two "pirates" have come up to the expectations
of the Navy Department; too much was claimed, for them
before they had materialized. The trial speed (23.073 knots
of the Minneapolis) was misleading and never since approxi
mated under service conditions. Their coal consumption waa
far greater than calculated and the coal to be carried -fell
from 2000 tons to 1670 tons, reducing their radius of action â¢
from 25.520 knots to about 7500 knots. During the recent war
with Spain the service rendered by these two cruisers was
not such as to encourage additional vessels of that type, and

great lumber interests, too, are reporting an active
; znd continuous demand for building material, and
the vast rural population of the United States is re
ported to be oh an unusually good financial founda
tion, farmers especially. Still, there is that slow
falling of the commercial barometer, represented by
the bank clearings, on which the country must keep
eye.
Here in California there is no halt As frequently
noted of late the city of San Francisco and the north
ern and central parts of the State seem to be having
a boom. Not for years have there been so many
Eastern people flocking in here looking for country
homes and city vocations as now. They are not all
tourists, either, but people who are coming to'stay.
It gives the city a lively aspect which is very cheer
ful. It has been discovered that San Francisco, as
(he gateway to the vast Orient, is to be one of the
three great cities of the United States, and energetic
men from abroad are getting in here Â¦ to seize the
cream of-the young opportunities. '
occasion for worry over the immediate future. The
is dull. On the contrary, it is active, though not as
much so as for some time back. Jobbers and retail
ers all over the country report a good inquiry for all
kinds of goods, and collections are generally reported
satisfactory except in the South, where they have
been chronically slow for a long time. The hesitation
seems to be confined to the higher and larger levels
of commerce, such as exports and imports, Chicago
and Wall-street speculation^ establishment of new en
terprises, etc., rather than the lower and smaller lev
els represented by the backs and stomachs of the
people. The crop outjoolc has distinctly improved
daring the past thirty days, and now promises an
ample production of farm jjroduce, from wheat
down, while prices for beef aim hogs are higher than
at this time of the year for ten years. The farmer
is doing very well all along his varied line, and as
long as he continues to do so the country has ' no
cent. x
It must not be hastily inferred, however, that trade
the course of prices in March was downward, Dun's
index number giving the aggregate of quotations
proportionate to consumption being $99,222 on April
1, against $101,543 on March 1, a 'decline of 2.3 per
same condition prevails in many other lines. Again,
1901, and the aggregate clearings amounted to only
$1,964,161,000. Not for many months have these
clearings fallen below the $2,000,000,000 point, and
have for L.veral years averaged over it A further
sign in this direction is the number of cities and
large towns showing losses, over half of . the
great cities coming under this head last week. < Ac
cording to these statistics the country is not doing
as much business as it has been. â¢
The decline in the volume of trade, however, has
not yet attracted much attention, hence it is reasona
ble to infer that not much significance is attached to
it. It may be due to several natural causes and prove
merely temporary. It may be that the spring de
mand has been satisfied and the summer demand
has not yet fully set in. Or, possibly, speculation
Â¦nay have largely subsided throughout the -country. It
is certain that Wall street is a quiet spot just now,
and the Chicago grain market shows a lack of spec
ulation and outside support which is rendering that
great market a comparatively tame affair at present.
However this may be, the trade of the country is
perceptibly lighter than it has been for several years,
and those lines which have been overcrowded with
orders, even to the point of refusing new business,
now find little or no difficulty in promptly executing
all orders that come their way. Last year it was almost
impossible to secure prompt deliveries in any branch
of the iron and steel trade, whereas very little is now
heard about .difficulty in obtaining goods, and - the
THE hesitation in general business noted a week
ago was even more pronounced last week. The
country's bank clearings showed a loss of 23.1
per cent compared with the corresponding week in
THE BUSINESS BAROMETER.
It is gentle spring, and the etherial mildness is
marred by the crack of pistols bringing down young
women who have refused the advances of scoundrels
who murder when they. cannot marry/ Now is the
time to start, girl insurance, and make money out of
it. Let it be remembered, too, that such a system does'
not interfere with the removal of < wretches who
threaten women under such circumstances. The hunt
for them can go on. This is the open season for. thÂ»t
kind of game, and should be improved by' all fathers
and brothers, and .even big cousins; who % can shoot
and who desire to protect their female relatives from
the vilest and most worthless. men that walk.
We see no preventive of these erotic murders, and
as American girls are not going to be less attractive
and their beauty is a fatal 1 dower, we propose that
it be made insurable. Instead of the usual physical
examination into the condition of health,' let tfie lady
be subjected to one that shall determine the measure
of her danger by her degree of attractiveness, and let
the amount of the premium be determined thereby.
This will guard her against a plea of the insurance
company in court that she' was guilty of contributory
negligence by the lure of her charms, and her family
will get insurance, if she be-murdered, wherewith to
prosecute her slayer if he do not kill himself, or to
buy. guns and ammunition 1 to arm the rest of the
daughters of the house for defensive purposes.
In such cases it is useless to resort to the protec
tion of the law. The threatener can appeal to a jury,
and his attorney makea it appear that he is really the
abused party, that he ias been "encouraged," and is
simply a harmless* and forlorn creature. So he goes
free, or if bound over to keep the peace pays no at
tention to his bond, for he intends murder first and
then the blowing out of his own addled brains, and
in nearly every case does both. So, as men look
with levity upon erotic threats, and the law gives in
adequate protection, the American girl is more . ex
posed to danger from this source than if she were in
the track of the lightning or cyclone, or were travel
ing by rail on a train whose engineer desires to pass
an opposite train on the same track with both at full
speed. \
Inasmuch as violence is always preceded by threats
in these cases, we have not scrupled to advise all,
girls to make such threats known to the best shot
in her family that he may go forth licensed as
fool killer in ordinary and perforate the cowardly
wretch who does the threatening.
But there ia a line that has been -ungallantly
neglected.- .We have often seriously called attention
to the erotic lunatics who murder women with whom
they think they are. in love, i Just now the papers
nearly every day record a crime of that sort. Spring
is its accepted season. Tennyson has told us of the
effect of the vernal equinox on the garniture of the
lapwing and some other sorts of fowls, and also of
its work on a young man's fancy. He might have
extended his remarks to show the necessity for girls
to face the equinox with side arms, armored jackets
and police protection, for it is at this season that
the erotic fool goes forth to kill the girl that will
not marry him. -As he also frequently kills himself,
the law is cheated of a victim and the girl's parents
of vengeance.
INSURANCE experts have been keen scented in
searching for things on which insurance may be
placed at a premium. Life, fire and marine insur
ance are old and familiar lines in that business. Then,
in the highly electrical States of the Middle West
they have lightning, and in the same section cyclone,
insurance. In the accident line we have a sumptuous
list covered, from stepping on soapy feet upon the
bottom, of : a bathtub to participation in the festivities
of a railroad collision. *
In concluding the study of cultivation of alkili
soils, the report says: , "People should not be de
ceived by a rank growth of plants in arid regions un
less !the characteristics of such, plants be definitely
known; for the very fact of the existence of alkali 'is
evidence of intrinsic fertility of the soils, and crops are
well known to have luxuriant growth on such lands
provided only that the saline matter is not present
to such an extent as to approach the> limit of^toler
ance of the crop grown. Notwithstanding the.pres
ent success with the alkali-resistant crops named, res
idents are urged to adopt the methods laid down in
this publication, as those which alone may reasona
bly be expected to give immunity from alkali damage
for any considerable length of time."
While the report deals' with all the physical fea^
tures of the region under review, public interest in
it will be mainly "directed to. those" portions which
refer to the possibility j of i producing profitable crops
from lands so heavjly charged "with alkali.-: '"To that
phase ofthe subject considerable space is given. A
list of "possible crops for alkali soils" shows that a
wide choice is offered for those willing to make ex
periments in such cultivation, while a table showing
the highest amount of alkali in soils in which various
kinds of trees, shrubs, vegetables and grains have
been found unaffected furnishes* a guide in making
the experiments, which will be useful to all who un
dertake them.

sity of California there has just been issued an

The issue will surely be presented when the convention meets, and it â¢ is to be
hoped its importance will be fully understood. The Republican party has been the spe
cial champion of labor and the rights of workingmen. It has insisted upon a fair day's
pay for a fair day's work". It is, but right, therefore, since it is in control at Washington,
that Congress. should see to it that the Government practices what j:he party preaches-
There should be nothing perfunctory in the manner in which the resolutions are
adopted, or treated after adoption. It will not do to embody them and lose them in the
general mass of resolutions likely to be submitted to the convention. The question
should be treated as a measure of emergency relating to the particular bill now. before Con
gress, and whose passage is desired before adjournment.
When the convention of the League 6f Republican Clubs meets at San Jose this
issue of the time should not be overlooked. Strong "resolutions in favor of the bill should
be adopted unanimously and at once dispatched to every member of the California dele
gation at Washington. . â¢ â¢
While every citizen is thus in a measure bound to promote the.'passage of the bill
as far as he can do so by urging it upon the member of Congress from* his - district," the
duty is in a special sense incumbent upon Republicans. The Federal. Government in all
its branches is in Republican hands. That party will be justly held responsible; if the bill
be ignored or defeated; and, on the other hand, it will be entitled to the credit of having
done justice if the bill be enacted. Such being the case, all Republican organizations
should be insistent in urging favorable action at this session of Congress.;,
The claims of letter-carriers for fair pay are binding upon every class of people/* for
there is no class that does riot benefit by their service. . At all seasons of the year, no mat
ter what be the condition of the weather, they have to. go their long and arduous rbunds,
distributing letters to the offices, shops, stores and homes of the people. For the right
performance of that duty there are required not only physical health and strength,^ but
fideliity, capacity, courtesy and an nntiring energy. Promotion is slow and is dependent
upon merit shown and proven in the service itself. The public would be prompt to feel and
to complain of any lack of efficiency in the service, and it should therefore be willing to
pay for efficiency. C . . i . ', '. ; ">
The bill under consideration is in no respect/ an extravagant one. It goes., no
further than to create in the carrier service an additional grade or class of carriers who
are to receive a salary of $1200 per annum; and to attain that grade a carrier will have
to go through a long period of service and reach a high degree of efficiency.
The measure is one of simple justice; At the present time. the Government does
not give adequate pay to the men who perform the carriers' duties in : the postal service.
There is no excuse for continuing this injustice.. The republic is wealthy, the revenues of
the Government are ample. As a matter of fact, the surplus in the treasury is so large- that
it has led Congress to act not only, with liberality but with prodigality in some directions,
and it is therefore the more unfair that a hard-worked body of public servants should be
made the victims of a niggardly policy in the way of salaries. .'*'.. . ..-:,'
FOR s6me reason the progress in Congress of the letter-carriers' bill has not been
so rapid as was expected early in the session. At that time there came; from
Washington cHeering- reports of the prospects of the bill, and those in favor of it
i were quoted as declaring themselves quite sanguine of its prompt passaged Of
late other measures have come to the front and this bill has been overlooked "so that
there is danger it may not be acted upon at this session.- . . â¢

for the Mayor and his appointees. The
papers filed were in the form of a gen
eral demurrer to the complaint of the
ousted board; a notice to strike out parts
of their complaint and a -motion to dis
miss the sweeping Injunction issued by
Judge Carroll Cook on the part of the
champions of "bubonic plague,"
The principal questions to be decided be
fore Judge Sloss are the power of the
Mayor to remove the medical men who
Insist that Oriental plague has existed in
San Francisco for some time and the
right of Judge Cook to Issue the omnibus
injunction restraining the Mayor, his
agents, attorneys, counsellors, appointees,
ets., from Interfering, in any way with
the duties, offices, archives, records, fur
niture and "bubonic plague cultures" of
the doctors who are so anxious to let
the world know that San Francisco is in
their opinion, a place to be avoided.
Tne courtroom of Judge Sloss is sure to
be crowded when the arguments of the
rival Health Boards are presented, and
it is confidently hoped in all quarters that
the members of the "plague board" will
be permanently retired from civic admin

Mrs. James Otis was a picture in her re
ception gown last Saturday. Mrs. Otis
only Just missed being a typical debu
tante, so youthful and girlish was her
filmy creation of white net over silk; arid
so well did it suit blue eyes and fair com

a few handsome diamond brooches graced
the corsage. Best of all, Mrs. Otis never

a San Francisco girl, Miss Ottille Scheuck
ing. Mrs. Sutro â¢ has family connections
in this city, but it has been several sea
sons since she came to the coast. She Is
very much in evidence In exclusive Goth
am society, however, and her magnificent
residence at Riverside drive is the; scene
of many brilliant social functions. On this
particular occasion- the entertainment of
fered was art afternoon of music, a dinner
and an evening musicale. Mrs. Sutro,
herself a skillful plants te, presided at the
piano during the afternoon, and Silas G;
Platt directed the programme. A dozen
clever artists were in attendance. Mrs.
Lewis Williams, the oratorio singer, gave
several songs and was repeatedly encored.
In addition there were selections by Miss
Edith Belle Roberts, AIlss Grace Belle
Van Riper, Mrs. Etta : O. Clinton, E. J.
Calthrop, Master Ernest L. Thebault,
Master Maxwell Kennedy, Dr. Smith N.
Penfleld, Miss Ophelia Dreismann, Miss

permits, the tennla court will be can

IX. Society is working with a zeal unpre
cedented this year for the dog show
of the San Francisco. Kennel Club, which
begins on the 23d inst. The fact that the
proceeds are for charity accounts for the
activity and -support of the smart set.
Disposition of the funds will be left to the
discretion of the patronesses, but orphan
ages will probably be the recipients of
box office receipts on this occasion. There
are all" sorts of "strict rules "governing the
dogs.. Entries positively close April 12
and your silent friend hasn't the ghost of
a show after that time. Then, " sadder
still, if the dear dog should fail to arrive
on the eventful morning of the 23d exactly
on time and promptly between the hours
of 8 and 10. he will find himself entirely
without social entree, no. .. matter., what
other technicalities have been duly over- '
come. -Or, granting that the- applicant for
glory gets it, if â¢ he is erroneously di
rected up the wrong aisle and to the
wrong crowd by mistake, he is no longer
eligible and cannot compete. I suppose
rules are important and must be enforced,
yet it may be a little hard on the dogs.
Mrs. W. H. Crocker and Princess Ponl
atowski will exhibit the only Pomeranians
In this part of the country. This breed of
dogs is the prevailing fad In New York
and England, especially London. Mrs.
Crocker and the Princess purchased these
dogs at fabulous prices during a recent
exhibition of canines in New York.
Mrs. Carolan will bring up from among
prize Â¦' winners* of Burlingame some rare
specimens which she purchased last Sep
tember at the Madison Square Ladles'
Association of America. Mrs. Hooper and
Mrs. Bruce will show some fine dogs I
am told. Two or three Chinese sleeve
dogs have been smuggled over recently,
although it is a capital offense to bring
them out of China, where it is the thing to
have one* up your sleeve.

If your hair Is brittle and thinning, you
have dandruff. The mere scouring ol
the scaJp of the loose scales won't cure
dandruff; . because dandruff Is nothing but
scales of scalp being thrown up by a pes-
tiferous little germ in burrowing Its way
to the root of the hair, where it saps the
vitality causing falling hair and in time
baldness. Now, you can't stop dandruff,
nor falling hair, nor prevent baldness un-
less you destroy that germ; and the only
preparation that can do it is the new sci-
entific discovery, Newbro's Herpiclde. In
fact, no other hair preparation claims to
kill thft dandruff germâ all of them- will
clean the scalp; soap and water: will do
that, but only Newbro's Herpiclde gets at
the root of the trouble and kills the dan-
druff germ.

was captured " this morning in the base

Circus Animal Takes a Stroll in Santa
Â¦A- R. Curtis'- black greyhound Leola
Â¦was killed yesterday in a course at Union
Park in a manner almost without prece
dent. She met Roy Hughie . in the first
round of the special stake and, In running
up the field, stumbled and fell.. As she
went down her long muzzle eiruck the
ground and shot her over on her back.
The collision with the ground broke her
neck and she lay absolutely motionless on
the field. Within the memory of old cours
ing men this is the first accident of this
kind ever seen here and no one could re
member a similar case in the annals of
coursing.
Mr. Curtis had better luck with his fast
flog Rector in the same stake, as he went
through it with colors flying. â¢ lie beat
Sacramento Boy easily in the first course
' of the day, showing two lengths greater
speed than the up-country dog. He then
disposed of Freeze Out, Dewdrop .and
Vandal and in the deciding course met
Tame Tralee. The latter was unsighted
from- "slips," but when he joined in. ;he
was defeated handily.
Two hot favorites were bowled over in
this stake. Narcissus, a 1 to 6 shot, was
beaten by Rocker; Tame Tralee, at 1-to 4,
was retired by Tralee Boy. ! '
In the open stake George Shannan's Sir
Pasha won, defeating Hickory Dick in the
deciding course. The winner had a "bye"
course in the semi-final round, as Santonin
was' withdrawn. The latter had a two
minute course, the longest of the day,
Â¦with Full Moon. The detailed results,

Fifteen -California Craft
: Cruise From Creek
to City Front.
Amateur Tars of Oakland
Buffeted by -Stiff South
wester.
The opening cruise . of the "California
Yacht Club took .place yesterday In
stormy weather. At about 10:30 in the
morning the fleet, on signal irom Com
modore S.- S. Marshall's flagship Thelma.
started down Oakland Creek in a heavy
rain and with a stiff southwesterly breeze.
On leaving _tbe mouth of the creek a
course was set to Meiggs wharf, where a
strong breeze and considerable sea were
encountered. Most "of the fleet turned
back at this point, but the yawl Spray,
the sloops Pactolus, Jessie E and Surf
and the flagship Thelma ran before the
wind to Sausaiito, where a salute was
fired In honor of the San Francisco Yacht
Club, the compliment being returned. ThÂ«
sloop Jessie li started on the homeward
trip from Sausaiito, but the sloops Occi
dent, Pactolus, Surf and the Corinthian
yawl Spray sailed over to Tiburon. Op
posite the Corinthian clubhouse a salute
was fired from the flagship Thelma.
Off Lone Tree Cove, Angel Island, the
sloops Thelma and Pactolus put in a
double reef, as a stray southwester was
howling down from the gulches. Soon af
terward the Pactolus carried away the
goose neck of her main boom and tore a
rent In her mainsail. George E. Miller's
sloop Occident ran ashore near the Tfo
uron ferry slip. No one was injured. On
the return trip the wind blew fiercely and
a heavy sea made the trip to the mouth
of Oakland Creek a rough and a wet one.
The fleet reached moorings at various
times from 1 to 6 p. m.
The yachts on the cruise were the fol
lowing: Commodore S. 9. Marshall's
sloop Thelma, C. E. Clark's yawl Gypsle,
Allen III. Clay's sloop Pactolus, J. T. Car
rier's sloop Jessie B, L. and S. Gate's
sloop Secret, K. L. Eames' sloop Surf, K.
C. Davis' sloop Iris, G. Bouquet's sloop
Hope, I>. J. Keane's sloop Amy, the sloop
Spray, G. E. Miller's sloop Occident. Jules
Hartmann's sloop Mascotte, the schooner
Challenge, the sloop Catherine and Frank
A. Bartlett's yawl Spray. The San Fran
cisco Yacht Club's new sloop, The Chal
lenger, was expected to Join the cruise,
but she remained at her moorings at Sau
salito all day.
Nearly all the yachts carried large par
ties on board, which somewhat increased
the difficulties of handling the craft. On
board the .Pactolus and several other
yachts were ladies, who certainly got a
taste of rough sailing.

Despite the high "wind and the threaten

shooters of the California Wing Club par
ticipated in the live- bird shoot yesterday
at Inglesido . and v succeeded in making a
few/ straight scores. .The (wind at times
blew "almost a* hurricane,^causing ' the
birds tb' make all manner of sudden and
unexpected turns.' -This .difficulty,, how
ever,, only served to add zest to the sport.
In .the club shoot : the contestants -were
handicapped. Each "man was allowed
twelve birds- W. J. Golcher, C. A: Halght

while ' Nauman -Donohoe; A. M. Barker,

' f erlng aches and -pains in -their*
bones to-day,' but the recollection of the
splendid welcome and treatment accorded
them by the Burlingame clubmen will
assiiage whatever pain they, are suffering.-
ThÂ« members of the local 'athletic, insti
tvtlon will never tire singing the praises
oÂ£ Joseph D. Grant, as he was the gentle-;
man who planned the expedition and was
chief host. Mr. Grant had invited 100
members of the club down to partake of
his hospitality, but when trie other mem
bers of the exclusive country club -heard
of. his generosity, they appealed to Mr.
Grant to make it a club affair so they
might join in receiving the guests.' He
was agreeable and when the tired travel'-'
ers crossed the threshold of the I Bur
lingame Club they were given a royal wel
come. The members ransacked, their
closets In order to fit out . their guests,
with dry wearing , apparel. Â¦Â¦'. Every bath- 1
tub 'and shower in the oluohouse was
turned over to' ' the trampera . and after
they had refreshed - themselves , they . par- .
took of a spread that was little less than"
game and showed remarkable quickness
in throwing men out who got too far oft
first. Householder went: out twice in this
way and Raymer once. - Atherton covered
first in fine style. r McPartlin . worked his
curves and slow balls' on Lohman's' men
with great success. Buck Franck played
short In sensational style for the visitors.

at yesterday's game, more than 8000 pass

Bryant's whiskers suffered during the
gale- and he had to tie them up in a hand
kerchief for protection. "Johnny" Cun
ningham drowned his sorrow at Phil New
man's absence and cheered for every one
in the house. Tom Powers, the "Irish
champion," tried" to talk to the Bur
llnRaine clubmen, but his affectation of
the English accent gave him away. Ed
Ru?s intended riding to Burllngame on his
b'ejele, but changed his mind, as he
feared he would not be entitled to a

solt with a change of clothes, so the only
change he could make was to reverse

BAN FRANCISCOS.
. Although, the field, was unfit for play,
some fast infield work was done. In the
fourth Birmingham sent a hot ' one
toward Bone, who slipped, Â¦ fell and then
recovered himself in timo to Â¦ retire "Big
Mike" at first. He repeated the trick on
Frary, the next man up. The morning
grime, .at Oakland, was declared off. on.
account of rain. The scoro: ';-Â¦?Â¦";
Â¦ Fisher's babies accumulated one more
before the game ended. In â¢ the eighth
"Truck" Eagan, In a moment of absent
mindedness, sent the spheriod -through
the kitchen window of a dwelling which
looms up back of center field. Eagan was
allowed to circle the bases, but he will
bo prosecuted 1 by . the housewife for ma
licious mischief.
The local end of the score "was fat
tened by four more.in, the seventh and
eighth. Dowling seemed to forget who
he was "up against," and consequently
was .hammered for a few. During Â¦ the
agony Bone, Lawlor, Shugart and "Chim
mle der Whale" arrived. ..Manager Har
ris thought this was enough, and I sig
naled for the flood of 'runs to cease.
While all this . was . going on Ur.cle
said several things to his braves, and
promptly In the sixth" spasm Lawlor
had a "wise" eye and took four .bad
ones. Nordyke and Holly beat out a
couple of little taps, and the bags were
all occupied. . Lawlor was caught at the
plate on Shugart's" drive" to short,' but
Lahey drew a pass and forced .."Dyke"
home. Then young Delmes took a huge
"Jolt" of Spring Valley,* closed his eyes
and brought In Holly and Shugart with
-a cracking two- bagger .to the. center
plat. He received a great hand -for his
trouble. The "fans" . are unanimous . in
their opinion that the "kid made
good" with a vengeance. He scored soon
after on Whalen's infield out.
Each nine secured a < point during , the
opening round. The Senators behaved
themselves until the fifth, when Dowling
caused the bell to clang. - He "walloped"
the ball for half the trip, made one more
o.i Sheeban's scratch hit and "spiked the
pan" on a throw in from center. " '
The diamond looked like Golden Gate
avenue .after "the sprinkling cart, has
passed over it, while the players', resem-
Dled a lot of men who had stayed out
late and were trying to walk home with
a steady' tread. For all that, the home
talent clear.ly demonstrated they were
the better "mud horses." Mike Fisher
felt worried, for he heard It rumored the
Sacramento public has sworn out a war
rant for his arrest because he "kidnaped"
such an unhandy. lot of club wielders. â¢.
"Pete" Dowling, "Waddell the second,"
toed the rubber for * Sacramento, while
"Chirnmie" Whalen, ' the same little
"whale." who .chews a . "wad", of â¢ gum
as well as ever,' passed out a few for
San Francisco. Whalen has lost nona of
his old-time cleverness, and all the vis
itors had holes in their sticks when they
tried to "soak" one of his- serpentine of
ferings. The local men thought Dowling
was throwing balloons at Â¦ them, and
went to it accordingly, while the big
"southpaw" tried to think of a' few new
ones.' Â¦" "' - i .". ?jÂ£l .â¢..;â¢Â¦â¢
hied themselves to the Eighth-street lotl
Nor were they disappointed in their
choice,' -for they experienced the joy of
seeing nine, of Uncle Hank's' "ghosts"
promenade over the -cushions, while
three of the Statesmen sneaked in when
they thought the Sacramento cranks
were not looking. .

Think of .the actual . growth in membership
during .these < thlrty-slx glorious years of
church extension, 2,071,000 added to our own
half of American Methodism In actual mem
bership and 8,284,400 to our constituency, bring.
Ing It up to 12,000,000. .
The raising of values is none the less start
ling during the period of this activity. Ninety
nine years ot effort had given us less than
?27,000,000 worth of church property. | But dur
ing the years of- this society the augmentation
has reached $120,600,000. while our 2948 par
fconaged,-worth. |3i, 000,000; have increased to 11 .
474, with a valuation of $10,600,000. And tak
ing account of all our educational, institutional
property *and publishing interests, the addition
of church -and parsonage .valuations, .in 18CS,.
reached a sum total of $35,000,000. which has
grown to $187,000,000 In the last thlrty-slx
years. ,. . Â¦ â¢
It took - ninety-nine years to make an itiner
ancy of 7175 ministers; to these have been
added in the last thirty-six years 149 per cent,
an average yearly accretion of . 249, against
76 per annum in the former â¢ period. In our
first ninety-nine years we aggregated a mem
bership - of 029,000. But we turn into 1902
3,000>00p;strpng. ; ,- \
After ninety-nine- years we held 10,041
churches, but the church extension era â¢ has
added 17,525. of which 12,018 were actually
aided into existence by the extension board."
Would you know the influence of the Board
of Church Extension upon the aggressive life
of the Methodist Episcopal Church? Then go
back to its inception In 1865 and estimate our
progress from the introduction of Â¦ Methodism
into America in 176G to 1805, a period of nine
ty-nine years, and. from 1865, the birth year of
church extension,' to 1902, a period of thirty
seven years. Remembering that the only sta
tistics available are those of 1901. And : re
member that- our own represents but half the
Methodist body In the United States.

the statement of the law made In an opin

that It Is evident it will create more gen

any opinion that has emanated from tha ;
office for months. In nearly every count;,
the attention of the prosecuting attorney,
has been called to the fact that certain,
persons are administering to the ailments."
of mankind without following the direc
tions laid down In the statute mentioned.
The prosecuting attorneys in turn have
presented the question to the Attorney
General, while. the doctors of the regular
schools have awaited the outcome impa
tiently.
Assistant Attorney General Ross holds.
In brief, that under the law only those
persons are required to take examination
and secure a license who actually adver
tise themselves as doctors, using the title
"M. D.," or publicly assume to practice
surgery or medicine. Healers and Chris
tian Scientists can thus escape by evading
these prohibited acts.

Now all this is changed. No special
agent will visit Montana and the wool
growers will make the best terms they
can with the nearest railroad agent. Ther*
Is as yet no disposition to hurry cars for
the wool business. The wool men express
the belief that the railroads are waiting
for business to come to them, knowing
that it can not go elsewhere.

In previous years special agents of these
railroads and the Burlington have gone
through Montana making vigorous efforts
to secure the largest possible share of the
wool traffic for their respective roada.
Cars were furnished promptly and every
possible facility was given for hurrying
the crop to market. When necessary, spe
cial concessions wefe granted. The North
ern Pacific always got the largest part of
the business, the balance, being divided
between the Great Northern and the Bur

When The Call was preparing -to test

Another very attractive offering of the
week will be the double bill at tfe Alca
zar, "Madame Butterily" and. "Tho Great
Unknown." "Madame Butterfly" i s one
of the prettiest plays ever seen here, and
the Alcazar has spread itself on the pro
duction. Miss Crosby, who essayed the
name role last year bo successfully, will
again Interpret the tragedy of the Japa
nese butterfly, and the cast will be .essen
tinily the same as last year. "The Great
Unknown" is an adaptation from the Ger
man by Augnstin Daly, one of .the Joint
authors of "The White Horse Tavern.',',
A house of amusement that is forging
rapidly to the front of things theatrical
Is the Grand Opera-house, under the man
agement of Mr. Ackerman. Plays are put
on there wiih a lavishness and attention
to detail that are not seen in many metro
politan productions. The stage manage
ment is notably good, the class of attrac
tions is getting steadily better and it is
not to be doubted that there is a distin
guished future ahead of the Mission-street
house. This, the fourth week of the Mac-
Dowell engagement, will be .given over to.
"Gismonda," with Miss Florence Stone in.
the title role. The play offers an excel
lent opportunity to Mr. MacDowell, who
is more than keeping up his reputation
as a sound and accomplished actor this
season, and Miss Stone's good work In his
support is easy to prophesy. The rest of
the cast will be well taken care of by the
house company, who are playing up to the
principals in very effective fashion.
To-night the Tivoli presents a new bill
that in all likelihood will rival its last in
popularity, the pretty light opera "The
Fortune Teller," that was such a success
here on its performance about a year ago
by Alice Nielsen- and her company. It is
one of the Smith and Herbert operas, and
one of the best of them, and the Tivoli
promises a production Of It equal to "The
Serenade," than which no more need be
eaid. Alice Nielsen's part will be taken
by Miss Lichter, who as the pretty for
tune teller should be heard to much ad
vantage. The piece calls for three come
dians, Boris, who will be done by Ferris
Hartman; the dancing master, who will
afford Edward Webb good opportunity,
and the music-bitten Count, whom Harry
Cashman will care for. .Harold Gordon Is
the tenor hero, Ladislaus, and Cunning
ham has the-CowIes part, Sandor. Annie
Myers will lend her sprightly wit to the
part of the prima donna, and Frances
Graham is down for the gypsy, Vaninka's
part. Carl Formes Jr. is to play the part
of Matosln.
After an absence of ten years E. S. 'Wil
lard, the noted English actor, will make
his reappearance in San Francisco at the
Columbia Theater- to-night- in Louis N.
Parker's new play "The Cardinal." This
play will be offered for six nights and
Saturday matinee only. Ths ecene of the
drama is Rome, in' the year 1510. The plot
revolves about the confession of murder
made by Andrea Strozzi to the Cardinal
de Medici. The latter is rendered power
less â through the â¢ secrecy which â¢ the
church imposes upon those who hear the
confessions of penitents â to aid his own
brother, Gulliano de Medici, when he is
accused, tried and convicted of the crime.
When every attempt to clear his brother
fails the Cardinal assumes madness, and
by craft the prince of the church forces
a confession from the lips of the guilty
man while- a witness is near at hand to
hear the same. Mr. Willard will be ably
supported by a splendid company of play
ers, headed by Ellen O'Malley as leading
lady. Next Monday night the star will
produce for the first time In this city J.
M. Barrie's comedy drama, "The Pro
fessor's Love Story."
Miss Wainwright.
Gorman and Keppler, as the comedian
and the dancer, bring forth applause.
Fred Stuber, the banjo 'Virtuoso, is a
wonder on that instrument. The way he
fingers it and extracts its tone brings re
peated encores. Â¦
James H. Cullen sings a few comical,
home-made songs, and Paplnta, the won
derful dancer, closes the programme.
The show at. the Orpheum this week is
a good one. It is exceedingly rich in
farces, there being four on- the pro
gramme. The first. "Uncle Epn s
Dream." given by the Clipper Quartet, is
a neat little niece with a "darky" set
ting. The main purpose of the sketch is
to give the ; quartet â¢ a chance to sing,
which it does in a pleasing manner. -
Homer Lind and company, presenting
"Gringolre, the Street Singer," do exceed
ingly well. The scene is laid during the
reign of Louis XI. King of France. Grin
goire, a beggar singer, becomes infatuated
â¢with the King's ward -and wins her love,
though under a -threat of death by the
King. The scene gives ample opportunity
for the audience to hear Mr. Lind's rich
bf-rytone voice. . Â¦ :
"The Yellow Dragon" is the title of the
act done by Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew.
This farce perhaps -won as much favor as
any or. the bill: The scene is laid in
China during the intense feeling by the
Chinese against the whites. Mr. Drew's
; acting as Jim Douglas, United States
; Secret Service, is well done. Mrs. Drew
I plays a close second to her husband and
Messrs. L. Fenwich, Louis Belmour and

Williams and Walker, gilt-edged come
dians, head the company, that numbers
fifty people, and Steven 13. Cassin and J.
A. Shipp are responsible for the piece, a
two-act musical comedy. The plot is in
visible to the naked eye, but amply suf
fices to hold together a lot of good songs
and specialties and to employ all the re
sources of the Jolly company. ..
The comedy is put on well, very well,
and goes with snap from beginning to
end. Particularly pretty are the songs
."My Little Zulu Babe," that is sung inâ
or rather mostly out ofâ costume, by Wil
liams and Walker, and with .. handsome
stage settings, and the "Castle on the
Nile," though there are many others.
Williams, whose "Goo-goo Eyes" is one
of the classics of ragtime literature, Isja
born-to-the-manner comedian. He is richr
ly comical, has a walk all his own, and a
way of singing coon songs that is simply
irresistible. Walker is another skilled in
the art of good fooling and his . efforts
lend much joy to the piece. Miss Over
ton-Walker is a clever ' soubrette, who
sings a good song and dances gracefully.
Then there, are very- clever Chinese im
personations by Mr. Catlin, acrobatic
stunts that tell by the Reese brothers and
Douglass, a good song by Mr. Gibbs and a
full money's worth of fun and music all
round. A crowded house greeted the per
formance.
You don't need to go any farther than
t"he California ' Theater for a laugh' of
laughs this week, with .Williams and
Walker in the "Sons of Ham" for the bill.
If a constant bubble of. laughter, dotted
all over with irrepressible howls, is any
thing to go by, the "Sons of Ham" is a
howling success. Just of the kind it sets
out to be. It is something of a unique
production. Written, and composed by
colored authors and performed by a col
ored company, it a3 easily funny as the
average ragtime comedy, is hot. ' One<
laughs 'and doesn't know why, and the
best of It is doesn't want to know why.
You Just laugh and that's all there is of it.

General Funston.
General and Mrs. Funston and their

night for Denver, Colo., where the general
on his arrival will take charge of the de
partment of Colorado. The drawing- :
room section set apart for the general and
his wife was radiant with flowers friends
had sent to cheer them on their trip, and
remind Mrs. Funston of the beauties of
the Oakland gardens which surround her
residence. -
Master Funston behaved splendidly,
notwithstanding the caresses showered
upon him. and did not seem to mind in

he stood the ordeal like a Hobson." Many

Dt. P. W. Cleaves' Eesidence Burns
to Ground and Family Narrow-
ly Escapes Death. .
ALAMEDA. April 7.â Th5\ residence of
Dr. F. W. Cleaves, 2265 j Clinton avenue, ;
was totally destroyed by fire this morning
and the- wife and daughter of Dr. Cleaves
had a narrow escape from being burned to
death. ' â â¢
Shortly after 1 o'clock the . doctor wa3
awakened by a crackling sound and, de
scending from his bedroom to * the first
floor, found the Interior all ablaze. He
awakened hi3 wife and daughter, who
were asleep upstairs, and then ran out to
turn in an alarm. The*wires were 'down
as a result of the storm and he could not
turn In an alarm. \ .' v -â¢
Returning to his house, l he found' his
way blocked by the flames, but- he got
a long ladder, placed it -against" the-win
dow of' his wife's bedroom, and carried
her to safety. This was no easy. task, as
she is an invalid. He then returned and
rescued his daughter. ' . f ,,
Hardly had he accomplished this than
the flames attacked the second etor,y, and
soon the entire building was- consumed.
Nothing was -saved. <.'-â¢â¢' ' ; . .

Caught Stealing Papers.
small i boys, > Earl Hamilton and
George Hamilton, were arrested vesterday
mornlngr on Sutter street by Policeman J
Flynn and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of, petty larceny. They were
caught stealing newspapers and when dis
covered they had sixteen in ; their posses
sion, all stolen. : , ..> ; ..
passengers at 9 o'clock. It was in charge
of Engineer William Billiard, Fireman J.
H. Marshall and Conductor H.C. Forner.
When the 'steam train neared the corner
of California street and Sixth avenue,
Â¦where the two tracks cross. Engineer Bu.
lard was on the lookout, he tays, but did
not see the electric car approaching.
According to the rules of the electric
line, and in fact all other lines, the steam
cars must be given the right of way. Con
ductor Black shouffi have stopped his car
before attempting to cross the steam car
track and ran ahead of his car in order to
'discover If the way is dear. This, ac
cording to Engineer Bullard, he neglected
to do.
At the time of the accident the steam
cars were w^ll filled with passengers who
had been out to the beach, but aside from
a severe shaking up none of them were
injured.
The railroad men who viewed the
wrecked car all agreed that there had
been a narrow escape from, a dreadful
catastrophe, for there Is not the least
doubt that had the accident occurred ear
lier in the day, when the cars on the elec
tric line were filled with passengers, there
would have been a number killed and
many injured.
William H. Black, the dead coctuctor.
â¢was an unmarried man. about 28 years of
age. He had been in the service of the
company about seven or eight months.
That death did not reap a greater harvest
is due to the fact that the electric car car
ried no passengers af the time it was
struct. Conductor Black fell beneath the
side'of the ponderous car and his head
was* crushed. The motofman on the elec
tric car, who managed to escape without
serious injury, together with_ the assist
ance of the engineer and fireman of the
steam cars, immediately ran to Black's
aid. The poor fellow was still alive and
suffering excruciating pain and the train
men experienced considerable difficulty in
getting hinÂ» from beneath the car.
He was removed at once to the French
Hospital. He was still breathing when he
reached that institution, but the lingering
spark of life fled almost as soon as he
was placed on the operating table. Dr. J.
P. Hickey, who attended Black, stated
that death was evidently due to a frac-.
tured skull,' but that the unfortunate con
ductor might have received other Injuries.
The accident, as shown fjy the facts
thus far ascertained, was apparently in
excusable. The si earn train people blame
the dead conductor -and the motorman of
the "wrecked car, J. Elliot. The steam
car left the Cliff House with a load of
Â¦William JL Black, a conductor on the
Sacramento and' Sixth avenue electric
line, met death last night in a terrible
manner. He -was literally crushed to
death beneath the weight of the car on
which he was conductor. The accident
occurred about 3 o'clock at the corner of
California street and Sixth avenue. It
resulted from a collision between a train
of steam cars, inbound from the. Cliff
House, and the electric car. The electric
vehicle was struck fairly in the middle
and turned completely over.

crowd which attended the picnic of - tfte
Knights of Tara in- the Santa Cruz Mourt
-tains -reached the ..narrow-gauge pier,
about 8 o'clock last night; the passengers
found considerable difficulty in attempting
to 'get aboard the awaiting steamer. A
rush was made for the boat; a swell lifted
it: high; and: the? apron creaked with the
weight . of . the ;, crowd of people upon it.
The rush was ; stopped-. in short order by
,the energy, of ' the deck- hands and police,
and only Â¦ a . limited ; number Â¦ werei I allowed
to pass the gates at a time. An hour and
a quarter was consumed in getting a por
tion of the passengers aboard, and a large
number were left behind on the first trip.
These were sent, around to the j Oakland
pier arid It was nearly, midnight before the
last ' of ;them Â¦ got- across the bay, as the
rising sea made it r impossible to get the
passengers .-, on" .the '.boat â¢ at >Â¦ the narrow

to come in or go out. Several vessels made
the^attempt to go to sea,' but were com

mooring lines were; thrftwn out and many
ships dragged their anchors, but the,dam

more lively on, the bay. The rainfall was
light, only .15 of. an inch being reported.-:
