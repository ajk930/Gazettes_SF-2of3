Rev. Mr. Guthrie, who was next in
troduced, said that to him the term Y.
M. C. A. always was a most happy one.
It represented the two greatest things
Young Men and Christianity*.
In closing Rev. Mr. Adams referred to
the debt of the association and the ef
forts being made to remove the burden.
He hoped that all who are Interested in
the moral progress of our ! young men
would put their shoulder to the wheel,
as it were, and assist in the grand work.
When Christ organized the apostolic church
of which each denomination claims to be the
direct representative, he called for men with,
the true spirit of God In their hearts. Every,
business man in San Francisco who employs
labor is looking for Just such men.' It is the
happy orovince of the Young Men's Christian
Association to turn out .that kind of young
men. The association ls> training men to. hon
orable citizenship. It ia doing a magnificent
work in training: men for the intelllKent per
formance of the ordinary duties of life. It
is a grand ghurch, one that should receive, the
support of. every self-respecting man- and
woman. '
to order, said that the Young Men's
Christian Association was in no sense a
social club, but a place where homeless
young men might receive Christian com
panionship. To these young men it was
in many ways a real home. There was a
huge debt on the structure, and the in
terests of the members demanded that it
be cleared .a way. . The. meeting was called
for the purpose of creating an interest
in the work of - the association among
church workers of every denomination.
A dispatch was received from Â¦ Mayor
Schmitz, who was to have addressed .the
meeting, announcing that he was unable
to leave Mount Hamilton in time to be
present. Rev. Mr. Adams delivered a
stirring address. He took issue with
President Watt, . who said the Young
Men's Christian Association was not a
church. The speaker said it. was in a
large sense a church, inasmuch as it'rep
resented the united efforts of all *the
churches of every form of belief. Resum
ing, he said:

a drink had little or no trouble in pur
chasing it. About the only difference in
getting one was that the thirsty man
was not allowed to stand at the bar and
in -many instances' he. was forced'to sit
down' to the "property sandwich" left
over from, the earlier days of tho Raines
law reign.'
But for all this it might easily be
termed a quiet Sunday. A tip was given
to the crowds that usually hang about
the saloons that their presence was not
desirable. In consequence the usual
hangers-on kept out of the way. Cap
tain Sheehan was active in the tender
loin district and before the day was well
along his men had arrested several bar
keepers. â¢ .
In the upper west side portion of the
city the orders for a dry Sunday were
observed to a certain extent. On 1 - the
lower east side of the city it Is doubtful
if one saloon out of 500 was closed. In
most instances a man could walk into the
side, door without, any trouble. Along
Seventh avenue and on the Bowery bar
rooms that probably have not been closed

all. In many instances the proprietors of
these places had impromptu bars rigged
up in the back rooms'' and served drinka

Secretary McCoy briefly addressed the
iheeting. He spoke of his; twenty years'
connection with the local association, and
referred to the great work being done in
the education of the young men of San
Francisco. The assets of a city were not
Its buildings, its banks or;rallways, but
its young men. He closed with a stirring
plea for financial 1 aid in order that the
building may be dedicated next year and
the mortgage publicly burned. Â¦
A collection was then taken up, but the
amount was not -reported. This closed
the programme." During the I meeting
solos were sung by H. H. ; Barnhart and
a male chorus rendered "The Heavens
Are Telling." Benediction was pro
nounced by the Rev. Mr. Guthrle.
' Greece and Rome . had their mighty armies
and- navies, but what- are they now? They
failed in those days to realize that prosperity
comes only with sound citizenship and sound
leadership. The Young- Men's Christian Asso
ciation makes Rood citizens, noble Christians.
The term Y. M. C. A. means to me simply "You
Must Consecrate Ability." It is by conse
cratine ability that, real success in life is at
tained. If I know that the engineer 'or a
train by which I am to travel is a man of
moral rectitude, I enter upon my Journey with
out fear. The influence of the Young Men's
Christian Association is the one great power
whose influence Is always felt in a great city.
What is doing more for the purification and
elevation of our young -men than this great in
stitution? There is a tremendous power for
evil in San Francisco with its 3200 saloons, its
theatrical enterprise, by which posters are
posted upon the walls, which if viewed by a
young man in the presence of his pure sister
will bring the blush of shame to his cheek.
Let us make the association stronger. let us
build it up, for it consecrates our young men
and to them we look for the material advance.
ment of. our prosperity.
Rev. Mr. Clampett delivered a brief ad
dress. He said that in the war now
waging between the British and Boers the
constant cry was "Men, men." Esgland
knows that if she expects to win she
must have men and the Boers also real
ize that they require more men to render
success certain. What is true in Africa
is true in every large city of America.
The question which confronts the future
greatness of San Francisco lies in the
character of its young men. Continuing,
he- said:
Robert Balfour, one' of the, warmest
supporters of the association,- and who
has given about $100,000 to the institution
in the past, was called upon for some
remarks. Balfour modestly concealed his
part in the work done by the association,
but paid a warm tribute to the manage

"This policy was by no means a new oc
currence in the traditional relations of
amity which exists between Russia and
the United States, and the events of the
Spanish war proved the sincerity of Rus
sia's purpose to maintain undisturbed the
friendship which, has prevailed for more
than a century, and which above all was
displayed during the war of secession."
"Adhesion to such a note would have
been contrary to- the attitude which Rus
rrta. faithful to the principles of scrupu
lous neutrality, did not cease to observe
during the entire Spanish-American con
flict.
"The. Russian Government did not give
approval to this proposition., because thi.,
second collective note had not as its ob
ject, as had the first, an amicable appeal,
but tended to express. disapprobation of a
policy of the United States.
"The message of the President was
subsequently presented to Congress, and
visibly aggravated the state of things.
It was at this moment that the British j
Embapsador suggested the idea of a new ]
step by the powers. At a meeting held !
at the home of Lord Pauncefote, on April
14, 189$. he proposed to fiis colleagues to
address to their Governments a tele- i
gram which he had prepared in advance, !
ihe text being in English. This telegram, I
translated at the British embassy into
French, was sent in accordance witn the
proposal of the British Embassador to
ihe respective Governments.
T*OTÂ£ CamTEYED A THREAT.
"It stated that, in view of the attitude
<^f Congress; the chances of conserving
the peace had diminished, and that the j
eeneral opinion prevailed in the United
States that war would be approved by
the great powers. The moment had ar- i
rived to dissipate this erroneous notion j
and to direct the attention of the Federal !
Government to the latest Spanish propo- i
eitions. The telegram . also expressed the i
view that armed intervention by the '
United States would not appear justifi- j
able, and that it would be advisable to i
give the greatest publicity to the com- I
munication to absolve the civilized world '
cf moral responsibility.
"The Russian Government did not give
to its Charge d' Affaires in Washington
authorization to join in this collective
note until fully assured of the eminently
pacific and humanitarian character of
'his representation, and only then when
the adhesion of all th- other powers had
been obtained.
"On April 6 the representatives of
Germany, Austro-Hungary, France, Great
Britain, Italy and Russia were received

presented a collective note, in which a
pressing appeal was made to the senti

the President and -tho American people
in the hope that an amicable . settlement
of the questions in dispute could- be

HEARING THAT THE FERRY DRXTO
11 Co. of No. 8 Market street, one of the
local agents of tha Fulton Compounds, had
a remarkable cas* to report, we last Friday lrt
terviewed the proprietor. His statement. wh!^k
he will verify to all inquirers, is as followa*-^^
"About two months ago a man came tnto
my store in an extreme condition due to
Bright's Disease. Ha was so swollen with the
dropsy that hia shoes were silt, his hantfr
were puffed and he was so ill that I did not
cee how he could live a week. I advised that
he go to bed and send for a physician, and
suggested the Fulton Compound. Be did as ad-
vised, calling in one of this city's best phy-
sicians. He went into convulsions that same
night, and the Judgment of the physician was
that he could not iurvive twenty-four hour*.
He rallied, but the physician told htm noth-
ing could be done and r declined to take his
money- for further treatment. At this junctura
he was put on the Fulton Renal Compound,
the physician acquiescing. He la now up and
around, the dropay has disappeared, his
strength Is returning and he was la my store
last nfeht (Thursday, Feb. 27), looking normal
In all respects. He was very grateful for the
suggestion that saved his life. It was a most
remarkable recovery, further details of which
will be willingly related."

It is hardly possible to overestimate
the value of this free consultation by

been the means of restoring perfect

THE PRIVILEGE OP SICK WOMEX.
No woman should delay the use of

womanly disease is neglected the greater
its effect on the general health, and the
slower the cur^. There is no object
in experimenting with other medicines

women proves that "Favorite Prescrip-
tion " is the surest and safest of put-up
medicines for the cure of disease pecuÂ»

or pay expensive fees in order to be
cured of womanly diseases. Hundreds
of thousands of weak and sick women
have been made well and strong by the
use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.
It establishes regularity, dries the drains
which weaken women, heals inflamma-
tion and ulceration and cures female j
weakness. It makes weak women strong
and sick* women well. : ., .....
"A few years ago I suffered' severely
with female weakness and had at times
dreadful, pains,',' writes Mrs. V. Brown,
of Creswell, Harford Co., Maryland. "I
went to my doctor, and he gave me
medicine which did me good'for a while,
but I would get. worse again. I had a
sick headache nearly all the time; was
so weak ] around my waist could hardly

cause of such a physical change, which
is not to be explained by the stress and
strain of (5aily labor, because there are
not a few who, in spite of years of steady
work, retain the girlish attractiveness of
face and figure. Perhaps the most im-
portant cause of this change is to be
found in the prevalence of ailments
peculiarly femine, which drain the vi-
tality and sap the strength. If the truth
were known it would be found that these
worn-out women had been working
under physical conditions, which, if a
man suffered them would be enough to

The United States will be divided Into clear
ing house districts to facilitate the current re
demption of the bank notss, so that the amount
of notes outstanding at any time always will
be co-ordinated with the amount of trading to
be done, precisely as checks and draft3 reflect
the amount of commercial work being carried
on.
This 5 per cent guarantee fund and the tax
upon the bank notes will be used to protect tha
bank notes and the excess of such taxes, with
the Interest on Government deposits, will be
used to pay oft the United States notes which
the banks assume to currently redeem.' It la
asserted that the whole $130,000,000 of United
States notes which the banks have assumed to
currently redeem will be paid off in thirty years
out of the taxes collected upon circulation and
interest paid by the banks upon Government
deposits. .
As the notes are taken out for circulation thÂ«
banks will deposit with the Government a guar
antee fund of 5 per cent of the amount of the
notes so issued. The national banks hereafter
will be required to pay interest upon the Gov
ernment deposits at the rate of 1 per cent per
annum.
The purposes of the bill are: To transfer
from the Government to the banks tne respon
sibility of protecting the necessary gold re
serve and tne burtUn of futiusii.iik; *oi<1 tor
exportation, thereby savins our ciimiiie.es from
the destructive apprehensions growing out oi

tal the privileges and option of engaging in
international banking unuer nauonai law and
so lay a foundation upon which to build an
American merchant marine; to remove the last
vestige of the doubt with regard to our stand
ard of value.
The measure provides for international bank
ing and a division of banking and currency is
established under a board ot" control, instead
of a single individual in the person or the
Comptroller of the Currency, as heretofore.
If the measure now introduced should be
come a law it Is confidently b^icved that the
national banks will assume tne current re
demption in gold coin of $i:J0, 000,000 of United
States notes. In consideration of the obligation
assumed by the national banks they will have
the right, during the succeeding five years, to
issue gradually as business may require an
amount of bank notes equal to CO per cent of
their paid up and unimpaired capital; pro
vision being made also for an emergency cir
culation.

When seen to-night, Payne declined to
say what the committee plans were or to
make any claims, but said he 'was en

of the leaders of the opposition element
said that the main effort on Tuesday
night would be to defer all action, at

-The tactical plans of the Ways and

to Representative Long of Kansas, who
was busy prosecuting his canvass. Long
was in consultation during the day with
Speaker Henderson, who is taking an ac

Means Committee supported, on the
ground that the opposition is > one . which
to some extent affects the regular organi

tations, however, did not lead to any new
developments in the situation. Those
who oppose the Ways and Means Com

a. list showing 108 Republican members,
with : some twenty-five others doubtful.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The body found to-day was that of a
man about 45 years of age and it had
lain in the water for perhaps thirty days.
Every pocket In the clothing worn by the
corpse had been rifled and the skull and
jaw had been crushed . in by a blow.
There was not a paper on the body by
which it might be Identified. The wounds
in the head made it certain that the man
had met death at the hands of a gang of
murderers and robbers, since his death
had been brought about exactly as in the
case of the four victims previously taken
from the river. The skull of each had
been crushed and valuables which two of
them were known to have had were miss
ing. The pockets bore evidences of hav
ing been rifled in each case. '.'/;/

was recovered in the early part of Janu

At the finding of the fifth body every

at the bottom of the series of robberies

After dining with the Vanderbilts the
Prince attended an informal reception at
the New York Yacht Club. When the
Prince and his suite entered Commodore
Lewis Cass Ledyard conducted the vis
itors to the "model room" of the club,
where the Prince examined the models of
the different cup defenders, the trophies
of the club and the America's cup. To
the latter Prince Henry devoted some
time, admiring it greatly. Later he was
shown through the clubhouse and a light
lunch waÂ« served. The Prince returned
to the Waldorf-Astoria at 11:50 p. m., ac
companied by Admiral Evans and Count
fachmidt von Schwlnd. He immediately
retired to his apartments.

promised to procure one for him.

NORFOLK, Va., March 9.â From pres

over. It is very probable that the strik
ers will not accept the terms of settle
ment named by the arbitration committee
of the Chamoer of Commerce last night.
Neither company nor strikers have de

objection of tne strikers is that they are
required to work with non-union men;
only Â£5 per cent will be employed and

E. J. Banning has served as assistant
United States District Attorney since
November, 1898, when he was appointed
by Judge Foote, who was then head of
the office. Marphall B. Woodworth was
appointed an assistant at the same time,
and his careful' attention to duty was
finally recognized, when he was made the
successor of Frank D. Coombs as District
Attorney. In February of last year Ban
ning was reappointed to his present post,
but it is problematical if he will bo al
lowed to serve out his term.
Duncan McKinlay hails from Santa
Rosa and was a painter for many years
before he essayed the study of. Black
stone and Kent. He has stumped the
State many times for political candidates,
and In 1896 he was placed on the electoral
ticket - by the Republican State Central
Committee to fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of Colonel Crocker. Mc-
Kinlay is 46 years of age and is a force
ful speaker, and it is generally admitted
that if he devoted as much time to hid
duties as. an assistant District Attorney
as he does preparing speeches there
would be a bright prospect of his legal
ability being substantially recognized.
.There is a. well defined feeling in the
Federal building and in legal circles that
unless Banning and , McKinlay pay more
attention /to their duties there will be a

The leaders of the strike assert that
the men will not sail to-morrow and that
the ships will be powerless. In the mean
time the owners are arranging to secure
other supplies of men and crews for the
hhips should this be necessary.
The sealers held * a big meeting last
night to discuss the matter but no de
cision was reached. The men suffer from
â¢ack of organization.
ST. JOHNS, N. F.', March 9.-In the
matter of the strike of the crews of tfie
sealing fleet, numbering about 3000 men,
who yesterday demanded $4 per hundred
weight for the catch Instead of $3 20. the
irevious scale, the sealing merchants
:ast nijht determined not to accede to
any of the terms submitted by the men.
The merchants intimated iftat the price
for seals would be at least $3 20 per hun
dredweight, the same as last year, but
declined to indicate whether an advance
was likely. The authorities say that the
condition of the foreign markets renders
an advance improbable. â¢
Regarding the other claims presented
by the men for better accommodations
and other minor concessions, it is under
stood that the merchants are willing to
make reforms next year but declined to
alier existing conditions under threat' of
strike. The matter is now at a deadlock
and both sides are working hard to score
a victory. The owners and captains
claim that the strike has virtually col
lapsed and that all the men are ready
to sail to-morrow, being satisfied that cer
tain modifications will follow.

The luncheon at the University Club was
given by the committee named by Presi
dent Roosevelt to arrange for the visit
of the Prince and escort him on his tour,
and the hosts were General Corbin
Assistant Secretary of State Hill, Admiral
Evans, Colonel Blngrham and Commander
Cowles. The party left the hotel at 12:45
o'clock with mounted police as a special
guard for the carriage of the Prince. A
The Arton Society presented to the
Prince an illuminated address, and an
nounced that during the day a cable mes
sage suitable to the occasion would be
drafted and sent to the Kaiser.
Message to the Kaiser.
"I never heard sweeter or softer music
from a male choir. I have heard other
music in this country which has given
me great pleasure, and It has brought me
to the conclusion that music is born in the
human heart without regard to race or
color. You should cultivate music not
only as a boon to yourselves, but for the
benefit of others."
The concert took place in the Astoria
gallery and began at 11:30 o'clock. The
Prince sat in the center of the hall, sur
rounded by the members of his suite, the
American escort, Embassador von Holle
ben. Consul General Buenz and Consul
Geissler. The choir sang the "Preis Lied,"
and after that, by request, an extended
programme, wnich Included "Old Ken
tucky Home" and "Dixie." The conclud
ing number was "The Lord's Own Day,"'
and it was rendered very effectively. The
Prince was delighted with the serenade.
and after shaking hands with the officers
*t the society addressed the members
triefiy in German. He thanked them for
what they had done for him and congrat
ulated them on their excellent musical
ability. He said In part:
It was the Ariou Society of Brooklyn,
winner of the Kaisers prize at the sing
ing festival in Brooklyn in 1900, which sup
plied the morning concert at the hotel, it
iiad been originally arranged that the
singers should serenade the Prince aboard
the Hohenzollern yesterday, but in the
change of plans the serenade was aban
doned. The Prince met Dr. W. J. Scildee,
chairman of the music committee of the
society, at dinner last night and ex
pressed regret that he was not to have
a. chance to hear the club play. The doc
tor said it might etill take place in the
hotel, and the Prince approved the idea.
It was midnight, but a few. hours to ar
range the affair remaining. Telegrams
and telephone messages were hurried out
to the members, and by 11 o'clock 150 of
them had reported at the hotel.
Sweet Singing: Pleases Prince.
When the Prince bade farewell to the
company at tha Vanderbilt home he went
to the New York Yacht Club for an in
formal reception, and the hour was late
when he returned to the Waiaorf- Astoria
for the night. He tound time between me

the day to receive a delegation represent

several callers, and to finally complete
the arrangements ior the iasi two aays'
stay in this country and his departure lor
home. He had Intended to be present at
the religious cervices on the Imperial
yacht Hohenzollerii in the morning, but
the case of scarlet fever which developed
a. few days ago changed that plan. In
stead he remained at the hotel, arising
late and breakfasting at his leisure.
2CEW YORK. March 9.â Prince Henry
was the central figure to-day in another
round of entertainment arranged In his
honor. He first listened to a concert In
the Waldorf-Astoria, largely made up of
his favorite American songs, the concert
having been arranged at his request.
When that was over he drove to the Uni
versity Club to a luncheon, which was not
concluded until the middle of the after
noon. In the evening he was a guests at
a. dinner of Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius Van

of yorsoris of social prominence.

Superintendent Russell when inter

tie-up was indeiinite and that not a train
was moving with the exception of the

Trouble has been brewing for some
time, but not until to-day was any de
cisive action taken by the trainmen. A
committee from the Brotherhood waited
upon Superintendent Russell and de
manded that the discharged crew be re

was declared, which went into effect at i

der of precedence so that. they shall not be humili
ated hereafter.
By some strange perverse way of fate the irritations
of Embassadors and the discontents of Americaiv
dignitaries over their' relative rank break out more
violently on funereal occasions than at any other
time. The first controversy among them that was
big enough and loud enough to attract public atten
tion broke out at the time of- the dedication of the
tomb of General Grant. Around the last resting
place of the illustrious dead there was a scramble, for
precedence among the living. When a few days "ago
all official Washington assembled in the halls of Con
gress to hear Secretary Hay pronounce his eulogium
upon McKinley the old irritatiort reappeared. This
time the matter is said to have reached a climax, and
it is announced, that something has to be done to
settle once for all the degree of precedence that is to
be conceded to representatives of royalty whenever
we have state occasions of republican pomp at the
national capital.
EVER since the United States was honored by
foreign nations by the substitution of Embas
sadors for Ministers at Washington there has
been more or less disturbance at ..the, capital
concerning the grave and serious consequences of
the change. Ministers represented nothing but Gov
ernments and states, but Embassadors represent sov
eignty, royalty itself, and from that fact flow forth
endless troubles.
POMP AND PRECEDENCE.
The recent report that the Rothschilds have bought
the London Times can hardly be true. They have
no need of a paper, and if any- noted newspaper
should pass into their hands it would soon lose its
influence as surely as the old New York World lost
when it passed into the hands of Jay Gould.
The Pacific Coast was not exempt from the busi
ness restrictions imposed by the weather. It is sel
dom that * stormy weather prevails over the whole
country, and, in fact, the condition is not witnessed
once in a decade, but such was the case last week.
A great quantity of farm produce which should have
found its way to San Francisco is still in the coun
try awaiting shipment. The submergence of the Sac
ramento River lowlands has upset the market for
beans, potatoes and other vegetables, and swollen
streams and breaking bars, up north have seriously
hindered the shipment of dairy products to this mar
ket The outward movement of goods from this city
has also been 'materially diminished. In fact, the
whole list of market quotations might be specified
as "upset by the weather." The interruption to trade,
however, causes no complaint, and is indeed regarded
with a complacent eye by farmer and merchant, who
are rather disposed tc take the jocular view of the
ranch hand, who, kept from his work by the storm,
looks out of the window through the curling smoke
of his pipe and remarks cheerfully: "More rain,'
more grass, master." The country is drenched and
what is not water is mud, but when the harvest comes
later on the State will see a sight that will fill it v/ith
satisfaction. A wet winter makes a full purse, and
it is the condition of the purse, not that of the sky,
that affects the prosperity of the State. Judging
from the current weather California will need a
bigger purse this year, for the one she: is carrying
row, capacious as it is, will probably be too small.
The wild and woolly West, with its pistol-wield
ing, wild-tearing inhabitants of both "j sexes and
memory sacred to romance, is about to lose some of
its laurels. The Legislature of Virginia is, about to
consider the propriety of permitting women to carry
the persuasive revolver. HfÂ§B
Still, in spite of these serious drawbacks, the coun
try did a good business. Eastern markets reported a
quickening demand for textiles, cotton and cotton
goods in particular, the strength shown by this class
of goods being the feature of the week. The West
and Northwest, as usual, sent in the best reports,
specifically in regard to clothing of all sorts, from
millinery and dry goods down to the coarser de
scriptions for farm and camp wear. Dairy products,
lumber, coal, iron and wooden building materials all
sent in reports of active markets, and all current
feigns favor the indication that, taken as a whole, the
general business' of the country is better than at this
time last year. The spring demand has been first
rate all along, and with better weather largely in
creased activity is confidently expected. The weather
is but an incident after all, and even if it docs cut
down trade, it is only for the moment, and in no
wise retards the commercial progress of the' coun
try, the expansion or contraction of which is due to
much deeper causes than the condition of the
weather.
THE week just closed, like its two or three pre
decessors, was characterized by storms ex
tending over the major part of the United
States and interfering with business in all sorts of
ways. They hampered railroad transportation, and
thereby cut down the railroad earnings, checked the
movement of produce from the farms to the distrib
uting points, prevented wholesalers and jobbers
from replenishing their stocks, and in the iron re
gions dosed down many plants and injured a good
deal of costly machinery. Under these circum
stances it is no wonder that the country's bank
clearings should show a decrease of 7.9 per cent for
the week, as compared with the corresponding week
in 1901. The telegraphic facilities were particularly
demoralized by the elements, and throughout the
whole week the service between Chicago, New York
and the intervening markets was feeble, slow and ir
regular, and messages were only taken subject to
dela}\ Those portions of the country not visited by
lhe?e severe rain or snow storms complained of dry
weather, and Kansas reported high winds with a
great dust storm, while Texas and Oklahoma re
ported that unless rain came quickly the winter wheat
crop would be a small proposition during the com
irg season.
THE WEATHER AND BUSINESS.
Our letter carriers deserve well of the Government
and of the public. It is but just that they be fitly
remunerated. The increase of. pay provided by the
bill before Congress will be small. No valid argu
ment can be raised against it. Its enactment should
be assured by an overwhelming majority in both
houses.
It is not too much to say that the people of the
country are overwhelmingly in favor of this bill. We
have not noted in our exchanges a single expression
of opposition to it. The issue, however, should not
be passed over with a mere tacit approval. The com
mercial and industrial organizations whose members
know so well the value of the free delivery, system
and the work of the carriers should actively assert
themselves in support of the measure. There is no
reason why each and all of such bodies should not
adopt resolutions in favor of the bill and forward
them to Congress. It is a matter well within the
scope of the work of such bodies, for commerce and
industry are in a large measure dependent upon the
efficiency of the postal service.
It is to be borne in mind that the carrier has to
provide his own uniform, and that it must be neat
and attractive. He is not permitted to wear old,
faded and threadbare clothing for the sake of prac
ticing economy. Neither, can he live cheaply and re
tain the vigor required to take day after day the long
tramps up and down the streets in the performance
of his duties. He must be well clothed, well fed and
well housed, for his work exposes him to every va
riety of inclemency of the weather in summer and in
winter.
The letter, carriers bill now before Congress can
not be /charged with erring on the side of extrava
gance. It is, indeed, a very modest measure. It
proposes no more than the creation of an additional
grade of the service for which the payment shall be
$1200 a year. That sum is certainly none too much
to pay for the labor of men who have passed through
so long a preliminary service, who have acquired so
much experience of value to the Government and to
the public, and whose tasks are so arduous and so im
portant.
These figures hardly need comment. They carry
their meaning on their face. Here are a set. of Gov
ernment employe's required to work, rain or shine,
in the open air, exposed to every sort of weather, at
a task requiring a high degree of fidelity, intelli
gence and physical endurance, who have at no period
of their service any adequate reward for the labor
performed.
Of all classes of persons in the employment of the
United States, letter carriers are the most inade
quately paid. Under the present system the letter
carrier enters the service as a substitute at $100 per t
annum. He serves anywhere from three to five years
on the extra or substitute list, delivering special de
livery letters and working in the place of regular
carriers, and during that period he does not earn on
an everage more than $25 per month. When, after
such a long apprenticeship he is appointed a regular
carrier he receives for the first year $5oo, for the sec
ond year $800 and for the third year $1000. It takes
the average carrier about eight years of service to
reach tl\e $1000 grade, and after that he can go no
higher.
Arguments in favor of increasing the salaries of
Justices of the Supreme Court, Congressmen and
other high officials are based, after all, only upon a
claim for an increased affluence and dignity of social
position. It merely means adding a little more of
luxury to their lives, for their salaries are already
ample to enable them to live in high degree of com
fort, to save money and to provide by insurance for
their families. The argument for an increase in the
pay of letter carriers on the other hand is based upon
a claim for plain justice. It is no more than asking
remuneration for the work performed and an income
equal to the needs of a comfortable livelihood.
WHILE Congressmen are meditating the ad
visability of increasing the salaries of Jus
tices of the Supreme Court and their own
salaries as well, the people should not, permit them
to overlook the claims of the letter carriers to a
juster and more adequate reward for their services.
There is a billnow before Congress for that purpose
and the country should see to it that it be neither
defeated nor neglected. , ; ; '

A writer In Lipplncoo's tells the follow
ing lesend of the ring- which the Arch
bishop places on one of the fingers of the
Britl3h ruler, as part of the coronation
ceremonies:
" 'The wedding ring of England' Is of
plain gold, set with a large table ruby
on which the cross of St. George la en
graved. Legend says that this ring be
longed to Edwaj/I the Cdnfessor, and that
he bestowed 1/ on an old beggar who
asked an alma of him, he having nothing
else at hand at the moment. Soon after
ward two English pilgrims lost their way
in the Holy Land, and were succored by
a 'fayre olde man,' who on parting said
to them: *I am Johan, the evangelyst;
and saye >< vnto Edward yovr King,
that I grese him well by the token that
he gaff to. me,, thys rynge. with hys one
handes.* Certain it is that James II, when*
detained by the fishermen of Sheerness on
his first attempt to flee the country, in
16SS, contrived to hide a ring, called 'the
coronation ring,' in his clothing. This
was a favorite ring of Mary Queen of
Scots, and was sent by her at her death
to James I, finally coming into ttte pos
session of George IV through the chan
nels by which he obtained all the remain
ing papers of the house of Stuart.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The proposal to loan surplus money in the treas
ury to f national banks for T per cent is almost cer
tain -to excite antagonism. There is no apparent
reason why the Government should lend its money
at so low a rate of interest. It cannot borrow for
that, and should not lend for less than it has to pay.
It will be seen that the banks which agree to re
deem United States notes are authorized to Issue
asset currency up to 20 per cent of their capital sub
ject to a tax rate of one-fourth of 1 per cent, whereas
those that do not enter into that agreement are to
pay 1j4.per.cent. There is- therefore an advantage
of 1 per cent in favor of the banks of the former; class.
How far that will be an inducement remains to be
seen. . ' "â¢;
For the purpose of supplying an asset currency
it is provided that national banks may at the end of
two years issue circulation equal to 10 per cent of
their capital, and thereafter may increase the amount
by degrees until at the end of five years the total
issue is equal to 60 per cent of the capital. The tax
on each of the issues after the first 10 per cent is
to be at the rate of 1% per cent. The notes are to
be guaranteed by a fund consisting of. United States
bonds or gold coin equal to 5 per cent of all notes
outstanding, and the fund is to be used only for the
payment of notes of failed banks.
-Banks that agree to redeem United States notes
equal to 20 per cent of their capital are required to
surrender to the treasury an amount of United
States notes equal to 10 per cent of their capital,
which notes are to be canceled and destroyed. It
is explained that 20 per cent of the present national
bank capital is $130,000,000, the exact amount of
United States notes for whose redemption the banks
would be responsible if every national bank assume
its share of redemption. One-half of that amount,
$65,600,000, would at the same time be presented to
the treasury for cancellation, thus in the aggregate
relieving the treasury of the burden of redeeming
$195,000,000 of notes and so put an end to any fear
of a drain of gold.
In the summary of the measure given by our
special correspondent at Washington it is .stated:
"Any national bank that shall assume the current
redemption in gold of an amount of United States
notes equal to 20 per cent of its capital, may, with
out depositing United States bonds, : immediately
issue an amount of bank notes equal to ioper cent
of its capital; and at the end of one year it may issue
an additional 10. per cent. On each of the issues it
shall pay a tax at the rate of one-quarter of 1 per
cent per annum, but should it^cease to redeem United
States notes it will have to pay a tax of 1% per cent."
The features of the bill most likely to meet with
antagonism are those relating to the assumption on
the part of the banks to redeem United States notes,
the issue of asset currency, and the loan of public
money to national banks upon a payment of 1 per
cent interest. The provisions of the bill upon those
points therefore deserve careful attention.
The bill purposes to effect the desired reorganiza
tion by creating a Board of Control, to consist of
three members, who shall have supervision of all
national banks and perform the duties now vested in
the Comptroller of the Currency; by national banks
assuming to redeem currently $130,000,000 of United
States notes: by. permitting "national banks under
suitable restrictions to issue asset currency propor
tioned to their capital; by limiting issues of silver
certificates to five dollars or less; by increasing sub
sidiary coinage; by providing for' the exchange of
gold for silver: by permitting national banks to have
places of business in^any part of the United States,
colonies and foreign countries; and by requiring na
tional banks to pay interest at the rate of 1 per cent
on all deposits of public money.
BY the Repubjican members of the House Com
mittee on Banking and Currency an agree
. ment has been reached upon -a general bank
ing bill designed to reorganize our monetary sys
tem. The issue is one of the most important to come
before Congress . at this session, and the time is
propitious for dealing with it. Banking and- currency
reform must be undertaken sooner or later, and it
is evident it will be better to enter upon the work
now while business is flourishing and our financial in
stitutions are subject to no strain, rather than to wait
until, some disaster comes and then be forced to
enter upon it under the pressure of public excite
ment and financial disturbance.
BANKING AND CURRENCY.
When two Senators got into a heated altercation
the other day Tillman rose and said to them: "If
you gentlemen are not careful you will get your
selves into the same fix I was a few days ago." The
Senate smiled, order was restored, and the debate
ceased to be exciting. The incident is a striking' il
lustration of how' the scandal of one day becomes
the merry jest of another.
A. great amount of money is being expended in reconstruct
ing obsolete types of armored ships in the French navy. The
Caiman, of 7239 tons, built in 1885, has received new .boilers
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Six armored cruisers of 10,200 tons displacement are to be
laid down during the present year for the British navy. They
are of an entirely new type. 1800 smaller than the Aboukir
class, and exceed the Monmouth, or county type! by 400 tons.
Their length is 450 feet, breadth 67 feet and draught 24 feet
6 inches. The engines are designed to develop 22,000 horse
power, giving a speed of twenty-three knots, and the normal
coal supply is 800 tons. The armament will consist of two
7.5 inch, ten 6 inch and thirteen smallerâ probably twelve*
pounder, quick-firing guns. One of these ships, the Devon
shire, 5s to be built at Chatham dockyard, and five, named
Hampshire, Argyle, Roxburgh, Antrim and Carnarvon, are to
be built at private yards. :
The long-delayed gunnery experiments on the old battleship
Belleisle were carried out February 19 off the Isle of Wight.
The forepart of the vessel had been reconstructed to represent
sections of the latest armored cruisers, with bunkers, water
tight compartments, protective deck, etc. On -one side "the
armor, six Inches thick, represented the Drake class; the other
side, four inches thick, is Identical with the 9800-ton cruisers
known as the "county" class. These sections or targets were
painted In black and white and were twenty feet square. The
ship, drawing fifteen feet, was anchored In sixteen feet of
water, so that in case of filling she could not sink very far,
and two gunboats opened fire at a distance of 1250 yards
against the Krupp armor targets. The gunboat Pincher at
tacked the six-inch plate with a 9.2 inch gun, and the Comet
directed her six-Inch pruns against the four-inch section.
Armor-piercing projectiles with cordite - charges were used.
Photographs were taken of the damage done between each
two rounds, and while the details of the trial have not yet
been made public, it is generally understood that the six-inch
plate resisted the 9.2 inch gun, while the thinner target was
demolished by the six-inch gun. After a dozen rounds the
object of the experiment had been attained and the ship was
towed back to Portsmouth.
THE salary of, Philip Watts, successor to Sir William
White as Director cf Naval Construction in the Britisn
navy, has been fixed at $15,000 a year, in addition to
which he receives $225 as chief examiner at Greenwlcn
Naval College. The office force of the constructive and
designing staff has increased from thirty-five in 1882 to ninety
eight at the present time, and the total salary list from $79.
665 to $181,%0. Twenty years ago there were only ten naval
constructors and fourteen draughtsmen; now there are thirty
nine constructors and forty-two draughtsmen. The salary of
the Director, which was $7500 while Sir Edward Reed and Na
thaniel Barnaby held that office, was raised to $12,600 In order
to induce William White to accept the position, and now the
Admiralty has been forced to increase it to $15,000. The Chief
Constructor in the United States navy receives only $5500 a
year and his assistants number only four naval constructor*
and about forty draughtsmen.
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Captain J. B. Coghlan, at present captain of the Brooklyn
navy yard, is a strong advocate for building ships In the navy
yards. He admits that such work will probably cost more
than if built by contract, but that the results would be more
satisfactory. He Is quoted as saying: "The Government can
build a far better ship for itself than a private concern can
build for it. The navy must have the best, and, therefore, I
am of the opinion that the Government should be willing to
pay the extra price and get the extra quality." Captain Cogh
lan was for several years attached to the Mara Island yard,
and had charge by turns of the ordnance, equipment and
yards and docks departments. He is as popular ashore with
the workmen as he is with the sailors on board ship and ha
has all the business qualities in which naval ofHcers as a class
are usually deficient. His arguments in behalf of an efficient
navy are, therefore, of more value than the opinions of most
other officers.
M. de Lanessan. French Minister of Marine, has at last
succeeded in curtailing the power of the head of the
naval general staff to reasonable proportions. This of
fice waa created originally in order to insure tha con
tinuance and development of a progressive- naval Â¦ pol
icy independently of the frequent changes of, ministry.
Every department of the Admiralty was put under his
control and the Minister became little more than a figure
head. The chief of staff having to attend to so great a mass
of details found no time to consider the question of national
defense, which was the chief object for creating that office,
and M. de Lanessan quickly discovered the absurdity of tha
situation and also resented the diminution of his own author
ity. He has therefore returned to the old order of things by
depriving the head of staffâ who is an admiralâ of all author
ity over personnel and material of the fleet, and making the
various naval bureaus directly responsible to the Minister.
It Is a sad setback for the clique of officers that wanted to
run the navy- A similar proposition to that which has been
tried and found wanting in -France Is being agitated by prom
inent ofllcers in our navy. Crowninshield, Sampson, Chad
wick, Taylor, Evans, Bradford and Higginson favor a general
staff,' with the admiral of the navy at its head, which would
practically run the whole business and leave nothing for the
Secretary to do except to sign his name. Such a board is now
in existence, but has not yet developed into anything very
serious or obnoxious. It is, as yet. only advisory to the Secre
tary and affords an excuse for shore duty for officers of tho
line. $*V
and two 10.8 inch guns of thirty-five tons In revolving turrets
substituted for the original 16% inch guns of seventy-five tons
In stationary barbettes. The reduction of weight by this
change in armament and gun protection is 432 tons, which will
raise the. 19% inch armor belt ten inches. The 10.8 inch gun
although lighter by forty tons than the discarded l$y 2 inch
has greater penetrative power and will demolish an Iron'target
33.? inches in thickness, whereas the capacity of the old mm
was only 29.4 inches under like conditions.

Three Thousand Klon
dikers Send Petition
to Ottawa.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DAWSON, Y. T., March 9 (via Vancou
ver).âThe miners of the Klondike, indig
nant at the treatment they havo received
from the Dominion Government's Depart
ment of the Interior, have appealed to
the Earl of Minto, Governor General, for
the cancellation of the agreement of the
Treadgold concession. A petition slgnecl
by 3000 business men of Dawson and gold
mining operators from the creeks was
sent out yesterday by special messenger
to White Horse, and from there will be
mailed to Ottawa.
The attention of the Governor General
himself and Sir Wilfred Laurier will also
be brought to it, and by this means the
miners hope to obtain redress from the
encroachments of the English company
that would monopolize their water sup
ply. Four well-known business men are
on their way- from here to "White Horse,
thence to Ottawa to present the whole
question to the Government.
Treadgold himself is expected to arrive
hero within a month ' and may come
through with Governor Ross. If an ab
solute reversal of the order cannot be
eftected the Dawson delegation will seek
a reprisal by tying the company down to
the narrowest limits.
One of the most Important mining
finds of the winter season was made last
week on French Hill, near Hunker
Creek. In bench claims large deposits of
cassiterite, or what is practically pure
tin, have been found. The discovery con
sists of nuggets of metal, Â¦which also car
ry gold values. The discovery was nrst
made ten days ago, and last week other
tlnda were made on a half-dozen different
properties, so that valuable deposits may
be opened up.
J. VV. Kerry of Seattle owns one claim
and will put in a machinery plant. Other
pold ilmls have been made on bench
claims. The newest quartz deposit to be
operated thia season will bÂ« the Lone
Star, owned by Americans, who have a
large stamp .mill- erected. Miners who

there will be u large development In

Sugar Refinery to Be Built.
Â¦ LOS ANGELES, March 9.â The Los An
geles Sugar company has about com
pleted the preliminaries necessary to the
construction of a large beet sugar re
finery before the close of the present
year. Affairs have reached the point

a company, of English capitalists at New
York. The company is expecting to re
ceive thia report any day, and, if favor
able, work on the construction of the re
ttnery will probably be started at once
The factory will be located in Antelope
Valley, probably in tho vicinity of Palm
dale, though tho site haa- not been defin
itely decided upon,\ The plant will cost
about' $000,000 and will employ about 200
workmen. ...

The Chilean Hteamehlp Palena of the
Pacific Steam Navigation Company ar
rived yesterday from Valparaiso. She
brought a number of puHgengeru, mostly
tourlHtK, and about 900 ton* of freight.
Her cargo included rubber, hides, wines,
roffc* wnd gold dust, valued at $100,000.
The PhlludHphla was at Panama when
the I'iiliim left them, and the Wisconsin,
bound for San Francisco, wna at Acopulco
In company with the Chilean vessel.

When the steamship City of Pucbia
dropped her anchor In the harbor late on
Saturday night the passengers sighed
with relief and officers and crew rolled
Into thoir bunks for their first sleep since
rounding Cape Flattery. The Puebla was
seventy-two hours coming from Puget
Sound, nearly twenty-four hours
than the time usually occupied in mak
ing the passage. She encountered the
heaviest weather of an exceptionally
stormy season. All the damage sustained
was the smashing in of two ports, but
that she arrived at all is to the passen
gers a marvel which will furnish them
with topic nf conversation for many days.
The wind blew with tert-iflc violence, and
during the worst of the storm, when not
hove to, the steamship was staggering
along: at not more than a three-knot gait
Some enormous seas were shipped, and
time and again staterooms and even din
ing saloon were flooded. All hands were
kept constantly on duty, the services of
the sailors being repeatedly required to
bale out the water that time and again
forced its way Into the passengers' quar
ters. The Puebla anchored In quarantine
about 11:30 Saturday night. She passed
the doctors and was allowed to proceed
to her dock early yesterday morning.

WAS ever a woman more the talk
of the hour than Mrs. Edward
Moore Robinsonl There . i3
scarcely a well-known drawing
room where she Is not discussed
and admired. Mrs. Robinson has come
out from Philadelphia with her little boh
to. visit her Bister, Mrs. W. G. Irwin,
bringing with her a retinue of maids and
no end of lovely gowns. Notwithstanding
the fact that this Is tho Lenten' season,
this popular matron is being feted con
stantly. There is scarcely a luncheon or
dinner she will eat privately for some
time to come. And it is not at all sur
prising, for those who know her most in
timately say that her splendid gowns arÂ«
not to be compared with her goodness
of heart and sweetness of mannerâ that
Bho has a most lovable nature.
But 1 must say a word about the Paris
creation in which Mrs. Robinson appeared
at Mrs. Kleanor Martin's tea laat week.
I The material was the rlcheat of silken j
j gray velvet cut bo simply but with grace
ful lines that suited the wearer's figure
I to perlectlon, and trimmed with satin
folds edged with cord. The skirt was
that artistic poster style that our best
dressed women are raving aboutâ that
clinging and flaring effect, very close ttt
ting from the hips to the knees, then flur
Â¦ ing out in swirling flounces. .
Gray is especially enhancing to Mrs.
Robinson's blondo beauty, and she does
not lose eight of this fact In choosing her
wardrobe. At Mrs. Irwln's informal tea
a day or two aj?o she uppeared In a hand
some gray gown with garniture of pink.
Still another pretty gown is of gray
crepo de chine, the bodice and skirt of
which are elaborately trimmed with white
lace embroidered in steel spangles, gradu
ated in size. There Is a deep yoke in the
skirt of this trimming and wide flaring
flounce of it about the feet.
Perhaps tho most artistic and strikingly
original gown is of nhlmmering panne
satin of a pale blue-gray tint. The bodice,
yoke of skirt and trailing flounce have
rare white lace Inserted In a rone pattern
and each petal nnd flower outlined in
"ppalllPteH, the French would call thorn,
but lu tho nverngu American thuy would
in- ln:Â«t â¢ rlt-Ms gray Requina. Thoro iÂ» a
richness about tho shaded grny npannlrm,
an elegance about lha lace und a Parisian
itir about the ensemble that makeÂ» us
wish Mrs. Robinson would wear ihla
K"wn at every function until we aro sa
tiated with its beauty.
That Worth creation which Mn. Robin-

FOR PROTECTION
Who would think, to seo Miss Edith
Preston nauntorlng gracefully along the
street in her simple tailor gown and hat,
that she is making preparations for that
important ovont, her wedding, , to tako
pined Kafitor Monday? MIsh Proston has
net forgotten this momentous event; that
im just her way of doing things; and
thosifl who know her beat and enjoy her
confidence assert that she really accom
plishes a grout deal of work in that trun
iiuil und caru-freo way of horn. If Miss
Preston looks as beautiful us she did at
lu<r sister's wedding recently sho will be
tho all admired.
SA^LY SHARPS.
Isn't it strange how quickly Cupid for
sakes those he has settled for life and
t-ecms to forget his past triumphs aa ho
speeds away for new hearts to conquer?
l'eople are Haying in the Islands that Cu
pid has left ' Harry Macfarlane and hi*
Lride of last summer, Polly Dunne, to
their own devices. Rumor has it that the
beautiful bride grew tired of .playing
blind man's buff and took occasion to ex
plain the fact to tho groom in words he
could not fall to understand. At any
rate, Mrs. Macfarlane has left Honolulu
fnd gone to her ranch for the preserit,
tired of play. Do not stay too long, mi
lady, for eyes in the tropics are very
brown and deep and dark and velvety,
vvhile the rare moonlight nights bring out
the poetry, especially when a man is a
native of that wonderful clime.
Now that we are on the subject of tho
ball of last week, have any of those dis
cussions be*?n settled yet as to who looked
the best? Mrs. Walter Magee Jr. was cer
tainly a beautiful picture in her costume
as "Night." with a clinging princess gown
t<Â£ silver spangled net over Dlack chiffon.
On the trailing flounces here and there
were silver owls, moons and stars, heav
ily embroidered. Tiny silver stars dotted
the gauze drapery that fell from one arm.
In one hand she carried a large sliver
crook. The . hair was powdered and
tiprinkled with diamond dust and the hair
ornaments were magnificent diamond
Â«tars. Perhaps the most "fetching" orna
ment Mrs. Mageo wore was a miniature
incandescent lamp, hidden in the lace on
her bodice. At the desired moment Mrs.
Magee could press a switch In her left
hand, and anon the light would shine out
to the n.ew comer. These light palpita
tions caused no end of merriment to the
inquiring friends and their fair necro
mancer.

CITY OF PUEBLA
ORTHODOX JEWS
PLAN A TEMPLE
United Congregation of
Keneseth Israel Cele
brates.
Addresses of Encouragement
by Many Noted Jewish
Divines.
Congregation Keneseth Israel held a
ceiebratlon yesterday afternoon commem
orating tho consolidation of the two
former congregations, Nevah Zedek and
Beth Menachlm Streisand, and some of
the most noted Jewish divines In Califor
nia were present to voice their wishes of
prosperity to the new organization.
The charter of the new congregation
was received last week, and the members
of the two component organizations were
merged into Keneseth Israel, with head
quarters at the synagogue at 353 Minna
street. It Is the intention of the new con
gregation to construct a handsome new
synagogue, and a lot for that purpose
has been purchased on Rausch street, but
It has been determined that a larger area
will be necessary to accommodate the
proposed building, bo an effort will be
made to secure a parcel of ground adjoin
ing. The new synagogue will bo the chief
worshiping place in this city for the or
thodox Jews.
Dr. J. Voorsanger, pastor of Templo
Kmanu-EI, was the first speaker. His ad
dress was scholarly in the extreme. Ho
congratulated the congregation on its In
tention to erect a house of worship, and
reminded those present that the basts for
such an undertaking must not be for the
Surpose of accommodating a larger mem
ershlp or of securing a more extended
ability to pay its debts, but should be for
the greater devotion to God. Kvery man
tn Israel, he wild, should bo a man of
knowledge, und In the extent of knowl
edge the strength of the new congregation
would lie. Tho lesson to bo learned from
tiil.Â«< union, he said, was not to acquire a
larger attendance nor to pander to human
grandeur, but to bring tho hearts of men
und women together Tn a fitting placo to
worship God earnestly, honently and
humbly.
Dr. Nlnto. rabbi of Sherlth Israel, had
Â¦onto plain statement!* to make to the
new congregation, and he made them in
IiIh usual pointed manner. H*> told them
they would havo to bear the tlrst burden
of the cost of their now temple If they
expected to secure outsldo aid for Its
completion. The small giver, if he gave
with a free heart, was as much to bo ex
tolled iih the one who contributed largely.
It mado no difference, he said, to society
at large whether the congregation wor
shiped In a structure built of marblo and
granite, or poured forth Us devotions In
a place where the cublo air ordinance
was violated. What was demanded was
a consistent following of tho ancient
teachings of Judaism and the inculcation
of thesu principles Into the rising genera
tion. When the spirit of this endeavor
became manifest in tho new congregation
It might look to outsiders with confidence
for assistance In providing such accesso
ries as were necessary for carrying out j
these ends.
Dr. Levy, rabbi of Beth Israel, had
words of encouragement for the most or
thodox congregation in the city. He said
he was willing to help secure funds for
the new temple by giving his time and
influence to the cause whenever it should
hecome apparent that the members were
in earnest in their professions. He scored
those who talked of reforming Judaism,
saying that the religion of the Jews was
God-given, and there was nothing in it
that permitted of reform. Â¦ The wealthier
Jews, he said, made a. profession of het
erodoxy because such a course was fash
ionable, but for himself, he said, the best
measure of his energies would 'be devoted
gladly to the furtherance of a plan for
securing a fitting place of worship for
those who retained uncorrupted the an
cient doctrines of Judaism.
Dr. Isidore Myers and M. Friedlander
also delivered addresses of congratulation
and encouragement and a generous sum
was pledged by those in attendance for
the furtherance of the building proposi
tion.

reception room. The members discussed
the question of securing: additional privi
leges for the chauffeurs of this city. Pres
ident F. A. Hyde stated that the reck 7
lessness or misconduct of one or two auto
mobilists would prejudice the minds of tha
public and of the Commissioners of Golden

riage and would indefinitely postpone the
granting of further privileges. â¢ .
A design consisting. of a winged bear
surrounded by the words "Automobile

Several Craft Driven on the Mud by
Recent Storms Are "Hedged"
Off Into Deep Water.
As the day for raising the bridge at Tlb
uron approaches the yacht owners of Co
rinthian Tact Club are beginning to work
upon their boats. The recent storms
caused several of the yachts to drag their
moorings and drove them hard upon the
mud flats bordering the lagoon. At high
tide yesterday the yawls Spray and Frolic
and the sloops Aeolus and Merope were
kedged off'" into water deep enough .to
float them comfortably. The big sloop
Rover is still hard' and fast on the mud
and .will remain there until a higher tide
affords an opportunity to try and pull her
off. Â»
As the owners are late In beginning the
work of fitting up their craft for the rap
idly approaching season, they will have to
work hard for the next few weeks to get
ready for the opening day. It is probable
the drawbridge into the lagoon will be
raised on the evening of Saturday, March
22, to get the arks which have been in the
lagoon during the winter out into the
cove. If this is done some of the yachts
will take the opportunity of coming out
of the lagoon at the same time.
The challenger launched on Saturday
at Folsom-street wharf No. 2 is now lying
off the San Francisco Yacht Club house
at Sausalito. The , work of rigging her
hull will at once begin, the contract hav
ing been taken by Lang, the boatkeeper
of the club.
TIBURON YACHTSMEN
SPEND A BUSY DAY
Park and Beach. Thronged â San
O ? Callaghan GivesThrilling Horse
manship Exhibition at Cliff.
The air was keen and bracing at the
| park and cliff yesterday, but not cold
1 enoug-hto mar the warmth of the sun
shine. Probably the largest crowd seen
at the ocean side this year was In evi
dence, swarming over the beach and flll
ir.g the Cliff House and Sutro's Pavilion.
At the park the crowd was large and
the weather perfection. The drive was
cne of the largest seen there in many
mcnths. The street railways were taxed
tÂ» their utmost, every car being packed
to the steps. The tennis courts a tforded
amusement to many.
An exhibition of horse-handling by Dan
O'Callaghan was the principal event of
interest at the cliff. Several hundred
people expressed their approval of the
show by encoring Mr. O'Callaghan. He
was assisted by several policemen, an ex
cited equestrian, who thought he knew
tiK much about horses as Dan did, and as
many onlookers as could break into the
ring. The trouble occurred just off the
back piazza of the Cliff House. The horse
won.
Dan drove up behind his 2:20 pacer and
found a friend struggling with a balking
trotter. The animal was of swell ap
pearance, but it didn't care to j move, ex
cept with a backward and forward see
saw motion very dangerous on the slope.
Dan qulckry turned his own horse over to
a groom and came to the rescue. Horses
will do anything for himâ except go. He
made his friend get out of the pneumatic
tired buggy and he himself got up behind
the plunging brute.
Ladles screamed and the policemen
side-stepped. The man behind the heels
ret his teeth and grasped the whip. Only
the horse looked happy.
"Gimme a gin liz," said Dan, as the
buggy went clattering backwards Into the
main hallway of the Cliff House, with the
frolicking horse close up, and the waiter
came running out, while the crowd that
had melted to make a lane began to close
in again. Before the tamer could get his
order filled the horse was trying to climb
the bluff, in front of the heights like a
coat. Then he did a waltz, sat down for
a moment and, rising, set his fore feet
and walttd.
â¢ The show lasted half an hour, with' an
imminent prospect each minute of the
horse or Dan receiving a broken neck.
A hostler led the animal to the sheds.
It looked back and flapped one ear at a
tall man in a gray ulster, who was lead-
Ing a large crowd Into the depths of the
Cliff House. ,; .-â¢ '
"Bay, Dan. that horse of yours Is a
pretty bad one, Isn't he? Why don't you
invest in something that will take you
home after it bring* you out here?"
The late arrival got no reply to his re
mark. He was no? even asked to take a
drink, and he went out in front to hear
the sea lions bark.
PERFECT WEATHER DRAWS
GB.EAT CIIOWD OCEANWABD
AS usual on the second Sundays of
the month there was a large at
tendance of marksmen yesterday
at Shell Mound rifle ranges. The
weather was clear and the air
perfectly calm, affording the shooters
every opportunity to show what they
could do. The scores in general were
Kood, In some cases much better than
the average.
L. J. Reubold of Battery D, First Ar
tillery, Xational Guard of California, hit
the bullseye five times In succession with
the rifle at 200 yards. G. C. Xutting of
the same organization was a cloBe second
with 21. A. H. Irving of Battery A
scored 24, 2i) and 22, respectively, on the
200. 300 ar.d oOO yard targets.
The other clubs present were the Ger
mania Sehuetzen Club, San Francisco
Schuetzen Yerein, ?Jorddeutscher Schuet
zen Club, Independent Rifles and the
Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol Club.
The days scores were as follows:

$307,800. Among owners whose horses
have contested for stakes and purses at
the track across the bay the stable of
Green B. Morris heads the list, with
$25,430 to its credit. To this sum must be
added the $150Â© won by Artvis, when that
colt captured the Bell stake on Saturday.
Thus it will be seen that notwithstand
ing an occasional "kick," the veteran
trainer should have no regrets for com
ln*T out to California during the winter
season. Compare the winnings at Oakland
with those at New Orleans, and It is like
purchasing a ticket for the concert at
.the conclusion of the show In the big
tent. From the inception of the racing
season In November no purse offered has
been less than $400. If owners are not in
good condition financially, they have no
body to blame but themselves. Following

Unlawful Contests Are
Held in San Quen
tin Barn. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, March 9.â Even though
cock-flghting is supposed to be an obso
lete pastime here and although there is a
stringent State law forbidding such sport,
thirteen different contests were pulled oft
in this county to-day.* These events were
witnessed by fully 300 spectators and not
only did the several birds fight to gain
valuable prizes for their owners, but a
great deal of money changed hands at
the betting 1 ring.
There was no police Interference. Many
prominent San Francisco sporting peopla
were present, as well as several Marin
County officials and Sacramento citizens.
Birds from Oakland, San Francisco and
Sacramenta were pitted against each
other. The combats took place in a barn
within about one hundred yards of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad and less
than a quarter of a mile from San Quen
tln Prison.
The matter was kept quiet until yester
day, although for many months the own
era of two of the best rated birds in the
State have been trying to pull oft a main
Various places were suggested, but finally
the neighborhood of San Quentin was de
cided upon. All arrangements Â» were per
fected for a regular cock-fighting car
nival.
This morning a large crowd went over 1
from San Francisco. Stages met the i
visitors at Greenbrae, conveyed thenv*
through the State Prison grounds to the
amphitheater a short distance beyond and
at 1 p. m. the first main was started
From that time until after 5 o'clock thorl
oughbred cocks were matched, money was
bet and birds were slaughtered to the de
light of the spectators.
The chief event of the carnival was the
main between Kenilworth of Sacramento
and Lucky Shot of Oakland for a
purse. After a vicious contest Kenil
worth drove his long steel gaff clear
through his opponent's head, thus ending
the match.
Sheriff Taylor to-night asserted that he
was In absolute Ignorance of the affair or
most certainly would not have permitted
It. He further stated that there will be no

yesterday at Ingleslde grounds. The
shooting for one of the Olympic cups,
confined to members of the old Olympic
Gun Cub, was. a feature of the day at
the traps. In addition to the interest In
the event a sullen argument as to a cor
rect decision was indulged In by Fred
Fcudner, who claimed 43 kills against 42
for Forster. The referee decided Feudm'r
had but 42 kills, which decision made it
a tie between the two men. Street, who
kept the score, had Fcudner officially
credited with 43, and Feiidner and many
others were positive that he, Feudner,
had that many to his credit.
Members of the club tried" to induce
Feudner to agree to the score aÂ» correct
ed. So positive' was he that the score and
hlH own count agreed that it waÂ« Home
time before he could be induced to con
sent, under persuasion, to shoot It off
with Forster at the next monthly meet
ing, on the second , Sunday in April.
Street, who kept the score, made strong
proteat agalnut the want of system on
the grounds. It applied to the habit of
thundering ciuefttioiis at the score keeper,
ami otherwise interfering with him at
tlm<Â» when lie should be left entirely to
lila olllriiil duties. Whatever interference
or interruption there might Â»be at these
matches it Is quite evident Feudner's
count and the figure* of the Bcore keeper ,
agreed. Feudner was at first marked
with a score of 43. The incident left an
unsatisfactory impression.

J. Healey's Sisquoc In a sensational
match yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
Not since the Connemara-False Flatterer
match of some years since has. any event
so stlr/ed the coursing enthusiasts.
It would be almost impossibly to bring
together a brace of greyhounds more
equally matched. The hare bending
[ slightly to the right or to the left meant
much to either dog. In the first course
thjB hare eurned on to the right and Sis
quoc, being slightly favored, won by a
score of 3 to 1.
In the second trial Sacramento Boy was
the favored one. He showed the speed
and won by a score of 12 to 2.
The third course was a spectacular one.
The hare went straight across the field
with the fleet dogs in hot pursuit. They
ran like a double team until the hare,
bearing slightly to the left, favored Sac
ramento Boy for the llrÂ«t turn. The dos
from the capital city scored 9 points to
his opponent's 1 in the subsequent work
on the hare. The fourth and deciding
course was won by Sacramento Boy by a
score of & to 2.
These scores hardly give an Idea of how
closely matched were the dogtf. They were
usually lupped on one another. The win
ner is so clever that he hardly guve his
opponent a chance to score a point once
they were within striking distance of the
hare.
"Jim" Sweeney sent Sacramento Boy
onto the Held in superb condition. The
admirers of Sisquoc had reasonable ex
cuses to offer for his defeat. Two weeks
ago he won the California plate stake
atter a hard day's running. Some months
since he was run to a standstill at 1'eta
luma, and has hardly recovered from the
effects of his exertion.
The match attracted an unusually large
attendance. A number of coursing en
thusiasts came down from Sacramento
to. see their representative perform. Peta
luma, the home of Sisquoc, was also well
represented.
The special stake" was won -by T. J.
Cronin's Vandal. He defeated .Merrimac
in the deciding course by a score of 6 to 5.
Merrimac had run 189 seconds to his op
ponent's 78 before they started for the
final. He had a severe run In the semi
final round. During the course Merri
mac fell heavily or he would undoubtedly
have won. / â¢ '
Forest Queen won the open stake from
Regal Attire. The latter also had 'a se
vere run in the semi-final round, scoring
twenty-six points to two for Crockett
Hill.
Emin Pasha youngsters, maintained
their reputation for extreme speed while
young. Two of this breeding finished first
and second in the puppy stake. Julius
Morn's McHenry beat !Â«'. Rodgers' Glau
cus for the big end of the purse.
The favorites were generally successful
throughout the day.

MANILA, March 9.â Colonel James For
ney of the marine corps, will preside at
tho court-martial to try Major Littleton
W. Waller and Lieutenant John A, Day
of the marine corps, March 17 next, on
the charge of executing natives of the
Island of Samar without trial. The court
matrial will be composed of army ofneerti
and officers of the marine corps. The
charges specify that -Major Waller â and
Lieutenant Day killed three native steve
dores en the streets Of Baeay, island of
Samar, without V trial. The stevedores
were among those who accompanied the
disastrous expedition of Major Waller
and a detachment of the marines to the
Interior of Samar last DecemSer.
It is claimed that these stevedores
mutinied and. proceeded to the foothills,
whero they dug camoles (a variety of
sweet potato), and that they later con
cealed and refused to turn them over to
the Americans, saying that when the
marines died of hunger they should halve
a good supply of. arms 'and ammunition.
Sympathy is expressed for Major Wal
ler, who at that time was suffering from
mental and physical strain. Lieutenant
Day apparently obeyed Major Waller's
orders.

bulary are closely pursuing them. There
is but a; small force of insyrgents In tho

Rizal province had no idea how quickly
the troops and constabulary could concen
trate and break their power. Complete
harmony exists between the American
soldiers and the native constabulary in
this district, and both have done excellent
work during a short campaign.
The troops consisted of six officers and

At an enthusiastic meeting of the St.
Patrick's day convention yesterday after
noon a suggestion was made that a per
manent parliament, consisting of repre
sentatives of the local Hibernian socie
ties, be formed for the consideration of
questions of interest to the Irish Catholic
people. The revival of the Celtic lan
guage and of Celtic customs among the
sons of Erin has created a necessity for
such a central body. The delegates to the
convention were instructed to obtain from
the societies which they represent power
necessary for permanent organization.
The suggestion was received with con
siderable favor, and there is little doubt
that the parliament will be speedily
formed.
At the meeting the entire programme
for the St. Patrick's day celebration was
announced. It will consist of Gaelic songs
and dances and orations, both in the af
ternoon and evening. J. S. McCormick i
will act as president of the day and will
deliver the opening address. Besides the
songs and dances there will be a recita
tion by Thomas Hickey. Rev. Father Nu
gent extended an invitation to the con
vention to attend St. Brendan's Church
in a body on the morning of the celebra
tion. The invitation was accepted. On
that occasion Rev. Father Concannon of
Stockton will deliver a sermon in Gaelic.
It was proposed that the members of
the various Irish societies be given the
preference in the purchase of tickets of
admission to the Alhambra Theater, where
I the exercises are to be held. It is feared
I that the theater -will' not be capable of
containing the crowd. The proposal was
referred to a committee. Remarks were
made by Fathers Dollard. McMahon and
Nugent, and Jeremiah Deasey delighted
the delegates with several Gaelic songs.

beyond the daily runs of the vessel, which
ranged from 60 to 100 knots.
Upon examination it was found that the
ship's propeller had broken off outside
the tube and that the rudder had been
carried away by the propeller. The Etru

by the British steamer William Cliff. The
latter bore' down and was alongside in

received here, and a new play by the
same author will doubtless receive a
hearty â¢welcome. The scene of the plav
is Xew York, the time to-day, and the
story has a strong love interest. The play
will be produced with the adequacy that
is a feature of Alcazar productions, an<3
has been carefully cast.
Th<^ Orpheum bill for this week Is un
usually attractive. Every number on the
programme received the heartiest kind of
bjtptause from tne audience last night.
Paul Cinquevalll. the juggler, is a won
der. His performance surpayes anything
of the kind seen in San Francisco for a
long time. With billiard cue-?, balls and
pool pockets which :irc fastened on va
rious, parts of his body he accomplishes
feats which are truly amazing. His work
with a heavy steel ball make? the onlook
er fcoicj his breath in astonishment.
. Lps Troubadours Toulousians. four in
number and <lrtsÂ£od in the costume of
the rur?l districts of Southern France,
sing in a mr.nner to evoke long continued
applause. The six blackbirds are a sextet
DC colored entertainers, who present many
novel and Birmslng features in "coon"
work. The three dancing Dawsons do a
great tleal of clever footwork which is
highly pleasing to the audience. The Nin i
Nelsons are as great favorites as ever
- and begin the rew week with several new
acts. Billy "Single" Clifford has no
trouble in keeping his hearers convulsed
with laughter. The Auers. with the.r
ragr pictures, and Eva Mudge. in her
lightning changes, are also great enter
tainers.
1 he California Theater has an interest
ing offerir.p this week in "The White
Slave." a classic among Southern dramas
that has been en the road continuously
lor untold years, and that numbers In iti
cast at least one member of the original
production. That it has still power to
dra-T was shown by the fairly large
house last night. t,hat seemed to enjoy
heartily the thrilling; story of the "White
Slave" and the ne^ro eccentricities and
scrips with which tne play is plentifully
besprinkled. There are two colored quar
tets that add much to the performance
and that sing quite musically a number uf
quaint "coon" songs.
Ruth Macaulcy essay r. the namo and
;.T.rt of Lisa, the white stave, and is suffi
ciently â¢â¢weepy" and sweet in the role.
Kate Campbell, as Daphne, tho octoroon
luietress ox I^aey. the villain, acts clever
ly, and Loduski young has a â¢â¢coon" ac
cent that tells. .Other rckmJ "colored"
vrork is done by Jennie Christie as Mar
tha.
The villain of the piece. Lacy, who buys
the white slave at a kind of bargain sa!e.
h> takingly pictured by J. Hay Cossar,
who makes tr.e most out of a pood part.
David Hartford has the hero role, and
does fairly well, arid Mr. Stich. the fam
i.y lawjcr, is played. to-day by Frank N.
L>rew. a? !t w;is played twenty years ago.
His wcrk was much enjoyed. The rest
nf the company plays woil up to the prin
cipals and the piece is nicely staged. It

HEADY TO BEGIN
COURT-MARTIAL
The Chicago trouble could have been settled
very early in the fight but 'for the politicians
and when It was finally settled It was neces
sary to insert a clause in the constitution of
the Building Trades Council and the District
Council of Carpenters eliminating politicians
and officeholders as delegates to the councils.
(Signed) The Executive Committee of Car
penters' Union No. 483.
. L. D. CORDON. President.
J. MAHCUS BURKE, Secretary.
We will cite the instance of the West Const
Furniture Company, where It was necessary
before a settlement could be made to have
McCarthy entirely eliminated from the ar
rangements owing to his brutal insults to. the
members of that firm. . .
The abuse of power by these officeholders
led up to the destruction of the Building Trades
Council of Chicago. The same abuse of power
Is being manifested In the Building Trades
Council of San Francisco to-day.
The conditions In the Building Trades Coun
cil to-day are exactly the same as they were
in Chicago before the great building trades
strike, which resulted so disastrously for both
the employer and the employed. The offices
of the Building Trades Council and also of the
District Council of Carpenters were filled by
municipal officeholders and politicians, who
held their positions through Ed. Carroll, who,
like McCarthy, was a Civil Service Commis
sioner and president of the Building Trades
Council.
Politicians Dangerous Element.
AVe will state that .at no time has No. -18:J,
In the eleven years we have been affiliated
with the San Francisco Labor Council, referred
any matter whatever to that' body pertaining
to the building industry. On the contrary, we
have always worked faithfully with the Build
ing. Trades Council and .Carpenters' District
Council, and until this objectionable clause In
the constitution of the Building Trades Coun
cil was inserted held . important positions on
the committees of both councils. The utter
falsity of McCarthy's statement that "our af
filiation with the Labor Council could in any
way Involve the building trades In any utrlkc
or other difficulty of the Labor Council; or
any of Us affiliated unions Is shown by the
fact that the Labor Council, under its consti
tution, has no authority to order a strike In
any trade or calling, and no one knows that
better than McCarthy, who . has been a dele
gate to the Labor 'Council until he discovered
that he could not dominate that counclL
Declare McCarthy jLs Ambitious.
McCarthy Is now reaching out for the car
penters', and in order to accomplish this under
taking had h clause inserted in the constitu
tion uf the UuiiiiiriK Trades Council in July.
1901 making the conatltutlon of the Building
Trades Council supreme over tho . constitution*
of all international union?. . This â¢ belns in
direct conflict with the laws : of the- United
B-oiherhctxl of Canxrnters and Joiners o{
America, Union No. 1*>, with its Â«00 mcrn
beie reiexred the whole matter to its general
executive board in .Philadelphia.
This board decided that under the laws it
our brotherhood no union of the brotherhood
could subscribe to section/ 3. article 2, of the
Building; Trades Council constitution.
The carpenters" district council, composed ae
heretofore stated, passed a reoolutlon .dis
regarding the decision of our general execu
tive board and requested the Building Trades
Council to enforce the objectionable constitu
tion on our members to the extent of prohibit
ing them If possible from obtaining employ
ment. This fact -was made known at our head
officts and J. F. Grime*, a member of the exec
utive board, has be^n detailed to visit San
Francisco and try to adjust the matter in an
amicable manner. Mr. Grimes will be in. San
Francisco on Wednesday.'
In the meantime we will state that but few
of our members are losing employment through
the action of the Uuildlng Trades Council.
To the Editor: An article appoared in the
Sunday edition of Th^Call purporting to have,

peaip.d almost word for word the entire ar

"before there could have been any opportunity
for the dWirlct council to have met in regard
tÂ© the matter. \Ne do not deny that the diu
trict council sent out this 'statement; but we
do sav that the district council is largely
made up of men who are under the thumb and
at the beck and call' of McCarthy at all times.
We 70 lurthc-r in this matter; we say,' and
we can prove, tnat trie Building Trades Coun
cil has degenerated into a. boay of the same
.character, Oeins largely. . composed .. at men
who are noliiins political jobs under the influ
ence vt McCartny. A large proportion of the
deic?ates to tho latter -boay, lnetuumg mani

Carthy yiliodi endeavor it is to contract the
unions in tiic bu.idicg trades l"or, his o?.ti
political ambitions, ruliy one-third of th<*
unions of the building trades at the present
time are controlled by McCarthy, on account
of their having no national head. They are
at th* mercy of McCarthy and his political
etsoe.ates and are virtually owned Â¦ by them.
Many pt these timers have no national bodies

of their national bodies. . -

The worst punishment of all was meted
out to Tsai-I Prince ; Tuan and Tsai Lan
Duke Tu-kuo, who were , sentenced to be
brought before the -Autumnal Court of
Assize for execution.'- .It was agreed that
if the Emperor saw fit ' to grant ; them
their lives they should 1 be expelled to
Turkestan land there. imprisoned for life,
without the .possibility of a commutation
of punishment. Life < imprisonment in
that country Is so much worse than death
that convicts Invariably choose the latter
when Â¦ permitted Â» to - make a- choice.'' Â¦
"When we get hold of a bold, bad man,
such, for instance, as "Little Bobbie" Van
Wyck, all we- can say is "Go way back
an' sit down." In China the imperial edict
is, "Go and commit suicide." 'It may be
that occasions : arise when: the I "Little
Bobbles' don't'obey; but in. China -when
a mandarin is told to commit suclde he
puts his house In order and executes the
sentence of the court. Because of the
troubles in Peking two' years ago, which
led up to a concert â¢ of -the pow
ers with . coersive sentiments, Messrs.
Tsai Hsun, prince :. Chuang, *"Â¥ing-
Nien, President^ of j'the ' Court of
Censors, and . Chao>s.,Shu r Chlao,, Pres
ident -of the ' 'B.o.ardÂ£of>: 'Punishments,
were condemned Â¦ to > commit ; suicide. The
edict ! was issued onUhe ; 21st of February.
Prince Chuang killed-himselfion that day,
while Ying-Nien and Chao Shu-Chlao took
their lives on the ,24th.Â«There â¢ is a â¢ grim

phone record of the Spanish song, "La Pa

flavored with tnAt touch of the romantic

As to the antecedents of Suanullo little
ctuld bo learned, his condition forbidding

terances It, is 'supposed the wounded
young man had fled from his native land
because. of the revolution. It was sur
mised that he might have been an active
participant In some of the disturbances
and had exiled himself in order to save
his life. But there was no doubt that he
was burdened with troubles, for, in his
broken way, Suanullo told the surgeons
that he was penniless." hungry and worn

Supervisor Booth said Uht nljrht that hÂ«
was a Democrat nod that cxplnlned tbÂ«
tiltuatlon so fur Â»Â» he was concerned. no-Â«
pumtne. h<* said:
"Inasmuch as the Superior Court has
declared the sertlon of the charter rela
tive to the appointment or Juj-tlpes' Clerk
void and has paid that the power to an

that they are good mm and merely, be

cause. I urn a Democrat Ih no valid reason
for rejertlnn their nominee, t am con
vinced they will not appoint a Democratic
clerk an<1 I am disposed to mike no
trouble. For these reasons I will vote for
McComb."
Supervisor Comte favor? the conflrma
t'on of McComb's appointment and states
positively 'that he will vote for him lie
paid last night:
"1 have- not a? yet inquired Jnto Mc
<7nmb'e qualifications and cannot there
fore say how I will vntÂ«? on confirmation
I dr. not do this on party grounds; but
Mrrinly n<-cau?<? I wish to survey i..c
ground before committing mypr-lf on the
question. If It is shown that the business
of the Justices" Court will be facilitated
by the appointment of McComb, I will in
all probability vote for him. Until I con
sider th<> matter further I cannot say Just
how I wil! vote." .
Supervisors Braunhart was non-com
mittal. He said:
Braunhart Non-Committal.
"I am opposed to the confirmation of
McComb on party grounds. I have no
. partlaular objections to him., but I be
lieve it to be the duty of the Democratic
Supervisors to insist unon tho appoint
ment of people of their own political faith
or. refuse to vote for any other. That Is
the only cours? for a consistent Demo
crat and for that reason I will refuse to
cast my votp to confirm ae nominee of
tbet Justices."
Supervisor Connor said
. Supervisor H. U. Brandenstein declared
that h*Â» was not prepared to state wheth
er he would vote for or against McComb.
He said that the selection of McComb
was a surprise, to him and that he would
have to take time for consideration be
fore deciding which way he would cast
his ballot. \
Supervisor A. A. d'Ancona stated last
night that if the matter of \ McComb's
election is brought up at the meeting of
the Supervisors . this afternoon he will
votj? against him. He said that he would
favor referring the election of McComb
to the Judiciary Committee, and that he
desired time to, investigate the* qualifica
tions of the man whom the Justices had
selected. D'Ancona further said that' he
is unacquainted with McComb, and' that
the action of the Justices was a surprise
to him. -
The question that will be asked In po
litical circles to-day is: Who are the
Democratic Supervisors likely to vote
for a candidate for office put forward by
Boss Crimmins and his gang? -
Interviews were eotight last night with
the Democratic members of tho Board
of Supervisors . as -to the prospects pi"
McComb being confirmed. Some of the
Supervisors were non-committal, and only
one. Comte, stated he would vote for
McComb. '
The Democratic Supervisors are Booth,
Brandenstein. Braunhart. Comte. Con
nor. Curtis and D'Ancona. rvhl e the
Labor members are Loughery, ; Lynch,
MiCUilan and Wynn.
In plating the name of George S. Mc-
Comb before the Supervisors for oon
riiniatY-. t;ie Buss Crimmins organization
are rÂ» .i?*; upon the Republican members
of thr hoard and hope to secure somn
Demcirnts to help them -out. The boss
and his henchmen do not look for "any
35-sistancc fToirrthe Labor Union Super
visors.
Supervisors Alpers, Bent. Eggers. Pay
ot. Sanderson. Wilson and lioxton. are
claimed by the Crimmins "push" as be
ing ready to vote for McComb. thus mak
ing it r.fcrEPary to secure the votes of
three Democratic members of the board
to *lrct him.
Rely on Republicans.
When Williams was" removed from office
by Mayor Schmitz and Powel Fredrick
was appointed in his place, McComb stood
stancbiy by Williams m his fight to re
tain omce. He was with Williams when
the latter was ejected by the police from
the office of the Justices* clerk on the
order of the Mayor, who had already
placed Fredrick in charge of the office.
That McComb's selection by Justices
Daniels, Dunn and Long was ordered by
Boss Crimmins is not unlikely. Although
the negligence of Williams was palpable
to every one who visited Ijis office, the
Justices of the Peace took no steps - to
remove their clerk until the matter wa3
brought to an issue by Mayor Schmitz.
Even then the Justices arrayed them
seleves against the Mayor, and in a mid
night meeting elected Joseph Windrow as
their clerk and refused to recoRiiize Powel
Fredrick, the Mayor's appointee. The
many documents tiled-with Windrow "by
attorneys were rendered null and void
when Superior Judge Carroll Cook held
that Windrow's appointement was illegal.
In the selection of McComb as clerk to
the Justices' courts the hand of Boss
Crimmins can be seen? McComb Is a
Crimmins man and the three Justices who
selected him are affiliated with the Crim
mins organisation.
As the three Justices formed a majority
the consent of Justices Joachimsen and
Groczinger was not required and they
were not present at the meeting .
George S. McComb, formerly employed
as a deputy in the office of the Justices'
Clerk, and who was removed from office
when E. W. Williams; was ousted by
Mkyor Schmltz was selected yesterday by
Justices of the Peace paniels, Dunn and
Long to be the cjerk of their courts and
his name will be presented by. the Justices
to the Supervisors for confirmation! â¢

Content With Life's Work.
In 1882. in grateful remembrance of his un
cle, he dedicated this superb college and later
on made many valuable additions to It. His
last -Rift- was made six years ago in the en
dowment of a fund to secure the presence here
of distinguished men for an annual series of
lectures. The enduring gratitude of the. pro
fession must be given to . Dr. , LanÂ« for this
alone. It is given to few men to be great as
Dr. Lane was, and all humanity Is bettered
by his life. He realized a few weeks ago that
hi* .work was finished and he told me that he
had gratified every wish and that he was con
tent, . â¢ .
His ambition In life' was to found a great
school of medical learning. He laid the foun
dations of thts building in a quiet and unher
alded manner and there was considerable spec
ulation as to. his' Intention. He met* with op
position from the residents in the neighborhood
and was . compelled to resort to the courts.
Even personal threats were made against Dr.
'Lane, but he finally subdued his enemies and
intelligence succeeded Ignorance.
The speaker told of the time spent by
Dr. Lane in the navy and how in his
search for knowledge he had studied in
European hospitals and colleger, winning
the highest rewards. Of the career of
Dr. Lane in San Francisco, the speaker
dwelt at length, arid in conclusion said:
Dr. Cllinwood spoke of Dr. Lane as he
knew him In his life, and then gave a
brief account of his career. He told of
the sturdy Quaker stock' that, he came
from and how he had laid the foundations
of his work by constant application to
study. The speaker dwelt upon. the great
friendship that had existed between
Lev! Cooper Lane and his uncle, Jacob
Cooper, during their ureumes. He told
how Levi Cooper Lane had paid his way
through college and lived on 25 cents a
â¢week and of the honors he had won in
competition. Â¦ â¢â¢ â¢
The anthem of Mendelssohn, "Be Thou
Faithful Unto Death," was then ren
dered and was followed by an address on
behalf of the faculty, delivered by Dr.
Charles N. Ellinwood.
Dr. Chester Rowell of Fresno, was' un
able to be present to deliver the address
on behalf of the alumni, owing to pro
fessional duties.
Speaks on Behalf of Faculty, f,
W. D. Blake of the class of 1902 de ;
llvered a short address on behalf of. the
students of the Cooper Medical College,
and offered a deep tribute of gratitude
for the munificent- gifts' of the late Dr.
Lane in the foundation of the college and
Its endowment. for the benefit of the seek
er after medical and surgical knowledge.
I was associated with him in the affairs of
this college and it Is fitting that we should
gather in this building and render tribute to
his many characteristics and sterling qualities.
His knowledge covered almost every field of
learning and he possessed a wide range of in
formation. He spoke many languages and was
well-versed in Latin and Greek and It Is a mat
ter of tradition that he wrote hts 'thesis in
Latin when he took his examination as a sur
geon in the navy.-- He once said that he nevtr
needed recreation to escape from .his work,
for his work was always a pleasure to him.
He was never a well man, but like a stole he
nfcver spoke of his ailment. For twenty years
he contemplated the foundation of this col
lege and he bent' all his energies In that direc
tion. He was free from ostentation and dis
play, and despite his great practice, he was
always calm and impressive. He was a man
of vigorous Intellect and sturdy character, no
ble in his aspirations and prompt in judgment;
he was firm in "action, yet modest In all, and
with Hamlet, I say: "He was. a man. Take
him for all in all, I shall not, look upon his
like again."
Dr. Gibbons dwelt on the career of Dr.
Levl Cooper Lane, and told of the intense
devotion he had shpjfred to his work dur
ing the last forty year. In part he said:
.Tribte by Dr. Gibbons.
The exercises opened with the rendi
tion of Mozart's "Lacrymosa" by an octet
of voices under the direction of Organist
Wallace Sabin, and the introductory was
delivered by Dr. Henry Gibbons Jr., the
dean of the college.
Dr. Henry Gibbons Jr., dearf of the col
lege, presided, and the faculty was repre
sented by Dr. Charles N. Ellinwood, Dr.
AaoiphBarkan, Dr. Clinton Gushing, Dr.
J. O. Hirschf elder, Dr. W. A. Gardner,
Dr. Stanley Stiilman, Dr. W. F. Cheney,
Dr. Emmet Klxford, Dr. W. Ophuls, Dr.
W. E. Garray,- Dr. W. N. Hanson and
Dr. A. H;- Taylor.* Dr. Edward K. Taylor,
president of the. college board of direc
tors, was also on the platform, as were
Dr. John M. Stiilman, professor of chem
istry,-and Dr. Lyman H. Wilbur, assist
ant professor of physiology at Stanford
University, and Thomas Price. - Â¦ â¢
. The entrance to the hall was draped in
black and the interior of the building was
lavishly decorated with palms, ever
greens, flowers and laurel. The bust of
the lamented founder of the college was
almost hidden in a bower of laurel, while
the chair that he used for many years at
lectures occupied the center of the plat
form and was surrounded by a wealth of
lilies and other blossoms. .
The gathering in Lane Hall of the
Cooper â Medical College was .a notable
one and Included the majority of the med
ical men in San Francisco. The students
of the college were present in large num
bers and the general , public was' well rep
resented. '.Â¦'<*â¢'.;.'!
Glowing eulogies and tributes of affec
tion were the' features of the memorial
exercises _ held yesterday afternoon in
honor of the late Dr. Lev! Cooper Lane
in" the auditorium of the 'college that he
founded and which bears his name. Dr.
Lane died on February 18 last.
