no_textTHE adobe bourne, the relic of early
California days, is fast crumbling
away. And the pity of it is that
little or nothing is being done to
preserve such houses, so that in time to
come they may be pointed out with pride
as the oldest landmarks of the State.
Sonoma has a collection of which she Is
really proud and well she may be, for
much history Â¦was made in them, al
though one would never dream It to look
at them now.
Naturally, one Inquires about General
Vailejo's home. It is a quaint old two
Â¦tory affair with the tinv windows, the
overhanging roof and the spacious ve
randa. The same beams are there that
ornamented It in early times, and that
serve so well these days to hold the
adobe in place. The doors show a marked
difference In architecture. They are
broad and are much the style of our
French window, open in the center and
swing back on hinges, and. another thing
âthey are perfectly immense.
This house is well preserved and one
would easily imagine that It was the
scene of many a splendid and glorious
celebration.
No kind of an occasion was considered
complete without music, singing and
dancing, and no social gathering was
ever finished without a fandango. Val-
Iejo's daughters were noted for their wit
in answering couplets, which was a cus
tom much in vogue at that time. For in
stance, a gentleman commenced a strophe
In a doleful strain, to the effect that "If
Yankees come the country's lost; there's
no one to defend her." Instantly a
charming damsel, with a twinkle in her
eye, "answered: "If Frenchmen come, the
women folks will willingly surrender."
The old mission building Is in a hopeless
6tate of decay. The adobe walls have
crumbled and fallen; the tiles have been
broken and have slipped here and there,
staying just where they happened to
lodge. The windows are loosely boarded
up; the light covering used as a shelter
for horses has been the plaything of the
elements for such a length of time that
the shingles and posts have long since
given up trying to battle with them.
But the pride t of the town Is what is
commonly known as the "Old Fitch
building." That is truly a landmark, and
one heard any' day and every day,
"I'll meet you at the Fitch house." Early
in 1S51 this house was the military head
quarters for the Pacific division of the
United States army and all commands
were issued from it. Such men as Sher
man, Kearney, Smith, Hooker and Fre
mont were stationed there one after tha
other, and each general had his own part

the least, a peculiar attraction for vis

SONOMA'S OLD ADOBE HOUSESIf it is intendfcd to ship the celery h*
the rough, it is tied up in bunches of
a dozen plants and loaded on the car3.
Over the first tier is built another "deck,"
and on this a third. Or th<* celery la
packed in .crates, each, of which holds
from six dozen -to'.: eight -dozen bunches.
A railroad car carries about 150 crates or
r early '1200 dozen bunches If the celery
iÂ» "decked" a greater . quantity can be
packed into a car than if it is crated, and
the cost of the crates is saved by tha -
shipper. Crates coat thirty cents each.
After the "banker" has done its work the
grower feels safe, for the frost is rarely
bo sharp as to hurt "banked" celery.
There remains but one process to be
described, but this is the most interest
ing and important. All over : the celery
raising region : the harvest time is one
of ' bustle. . Every available man, woman
and child in the district is engaged j In
gathering in the crop. The roots of the
celery are so tenacious that to pull them
,up would bruise the stalks. ; They are,
therefore, cut off by. a contrivance
mounted -on wheels and pulled down tha
rows by a pair of horses wearing big
wooden . shoes, .. eight inches .â¢ wide,' ten
long and one and a half thick, to keep
them from getting bogged in the soft
peatlands. The "cutter" has a knife
fitted to a bar which may be raised '.or
ard are sent from Arizona or Northern
California, being' pat together at the
packing-houses. Some shippers_ send the
celery away in refrigerator cars, as, un
less this Is done, ' the celery 13 apt to
reach its destination in a damaged condi
tion. The ice for a car costs from, forty
to' eighty dollars according to the dis
tance of the market.- The celery that ia
shipped uncrated" is loaded in "decked"
cars, and, on arriving at Kansas City tha
lumber used in "decking" is cut up to
make crates in which the celery is for
warded from that city.- In 1900 the num
ber of carloads sent to the East was 736.
and In 1901 about a . thousand cars were
needed to carry the crop. In 1901 about
2400 acres were planted to celery, but ow
ing to loss from foul seed and damage
from an overflow only about 1600 or 1700
acres, were: harvested. .
At first the celery crop was chiefly dis
posed of by a commission men, but in tha
last two or three years buyers have con
tracted for the crop at ; the beginning of
the season, a plan which enables tho
grower to ' know his position more satis
factorily. The cost of raising a crop from
the beginning to the completion of the
harvesting varies considerably according
to circumstances, estimates varying from
$25 to $70 per acre. Including the rent
of the ground $50 per acre Is considered
a fair average cost, and, -with celery at
fifteen cents per. "doz&nr bunches the â¢crop>
realizes about $IC0 per acre. There have
been instances of a profit of $250 per acre
being obtained and several growers esti
mate their average net profits at $123
to $150 per acre.
sary to the nutrition of the body, having
In themselves the types of food which arÂ»
represented by the fats, the nitrogenous
or protein bodies and the carbo-hydrates.
In addition to these, they contain, those
mineral elements of which the bony struc
ture of the body la composed, viz.: lime
and phosphoric acid.
If, therefore, man were confined to a
single article of diet, there is nothing
which would be so suitable for his use as
the cereals.: Starch and sugar are pri
marily the foods which furnish animal
heat and energy and hence should be used
in great -abundance by those who are en
gaged in manual labor.
The workingmen of our country, espe
cially, should consider this point and ac
custom themselves more and more to the
use of cereals In their foods. When prop
erly prepared and properly served, they
are palatable as well as nutritious, and
their judicious use in this way would tend
to diminish . the , craving for flesh, which,
however, it Is not advisable to excluda
entirely. from the diet.
By persons whose habits of life are
sedentary, requiring but little physical
exertion, starch and sugar should be eat
en more sparingly, since if used for sup
plying energy for muscular exertion, they
are largely converted into fat. thus pro
ducing a condition of stoutness which
Js looked forward to with fear by all who
hope to retain undiminished their bodily
powers.
In other words, the well-to-do person
as a rule, whese habits are sedentary, can
eat meat with less danger of acquiring
that excess of adipose to which reference
has just been made.
tain only about 10 per cent of waste and
this is an exceedingly email proportion. as
compared with the percentage in meats.
If meats should' be used as suggested
above, more ; for â¢ condimental purposes,
as In the making of soups, stews, etc.,
and not more than once a day as one of
the staple articles of the table, it would
be better, in ; my opinion, for . the health
and strength of the consumer, and espe
cially would -it be a saving in the matter
of household expenses. Â¦ . ~.
. It is well known that men who are
nourished very extensively on cereals are
capable of the hardest and most enduring
manual labor.' Meats, are quickly digest
ed, furnish an abundance of energy soon
after*, consumption, but are not retained
in the digestive organism long enough to
sustain permanent muscular exertion.
On the other hand, cereal foods are
more slowly digested, furnish the energy
necessary to digestlon'and the vital func
tions in a more uniform manner and thu3
are better suited to sustain hard manual
labor for a long period of time. .
Cereals contain as their most abundant
constituent an element of food which is
practically absent In meats, viz. ; carbo
hydrates, of which starch and sugar are
types. . Starch and sugar alone are not
sufficient to give permanent nourishment
to the body, since they fail to contain the
elements ; necessary to the nourishment,
especially to the muscular tissues of. the
body.
In cereals, however, the starch Is com
bined with an abundant supply of nitro
genous materials, of which the gluten of
wheat flour is a type. It so happens that
the cereals contain all the elements neces-
lowered. The knife is set at right angles
to .the rows of celeryand cuts the. plants
at. a desired, point below the surface of
the soil. After the cutter has got a
start of .a dozen rows or so the "trim
mers"- follow,- and with butchers' -knives
trim off the butts of the bunches and
remove all superfluous or damaged stalks
and leaves.
in La Crosse, Wis., the best liked varieties
being named "White Plume" and "Golden
Heart." The seed beds after careful prep
aration are sown thickly in rows or
broadcast about the end of March or early
in April. The young plants are weeded
and thinned out until they reach a suit
able size, when they are taken up by
hand, and, after being trimmed at top and
root, are packed "In boxes and carried to
the fields that have been prepared for set
ting. There men or boys transplant them
one by one in holes made with a tapering
stick and settle the earth round the, roots
with their hands. -The young plants are
ready for transplantation to the field rows
about July 1, but the operation may be
performed successfully at any time during
July or August. The ground in which
they are set 'out must be moist enough to
nourish the young plants until they re
cover from the somewhat rough process
of transplantation.
The plants are set out In drills four feet
apart from center to center and about
12,000 to the acre. If any of them fail to
grow others are set in their places, though
the loss on this account is only small.
But the rich soil which nurtures the
celery produces also an abundant crop of
weeds, which must be kept down, either
by hand work or by the use of imple
ments specially devised for the purpose.
In many cases the task of weeding must
be performed repeatedly. It is also nec
essary to keep the soil away from the
stalks of growing celery. This is done by
a machine named "a crowder," which, be
ing driven down the field, draws the earth
away from the celery stalks to form a
ridge between the rows. This process
sometimes has to be repeated once or even
twice before, the celery is ready to be
"banked." As the celery grows the earth
is shifted back from the ridge toward the
stalks, but is not pressed against them,
the object being simply to afford shelter
and shade to the growing plant. About
the middle of November the ridge of soil
is divided down the middle by a sort of
double-winged piow and Is moved In equal
parts near to the rows of celery, where it
remains until the time for "banking" ar
rives. This is just the opposite process to
"crowding." The "banking" ; machine
places the earth firmly against the stalks
on both sides, packing it solidly as a pro
tection against frosts or parching winds.
It also; bleaches the stalks and renders
them crisp.
The time required by crops to reach ma
turity varies somewhat, but celery set
out on July i "should be ready, if all goes
well, for the Thanksgiving day market.
It keeps coming on from that date until
the end of March. During the season of
1900 and 1901 the demand for celery was so
great that much of it was sold without
having been "banked" at all. But as the
season advances it becomes necessary 'to
"bank" it, for the frost, while it- does not
often visit the peatlands, is severe enough
to render the celery unfit for market un
less it is protected -by a shield of soil.
some of the ways in which a cheaper
substance than meat may be made to
serve the double purpose of nutrition and
palatability.
I think the statement may be accepted
without question that, as a rule, we eat
too much, not only of meat, but of all
forms of food. The question of limiting
the diet, however, is one that deserves
more than a passing notice, and is based
primarily not on the principles of econ
omy, but on the requirements of hy
giene.
Both undernutrition and overnutrition
act unfavorably on the animal economy,
causing, on the one hand, a deposit of un
necessary fat, and on the other interfer
ence with the vital processes, by reason
of diminished or insufficient materials for
renewing the waste of the body.
Comparative anatomy has shown that
man is an omnivorous animal and, there
fore, there can be no question of the right
and propriety of flesh eating. In addition
to this, the taste of well-prepared meats*
is most delightful, and man in his normal
state has a craving for a meat diet, or at
least one in which meat figures to a con
siderable extent. This craving may be
satisfied In some degree without indulg
ing too freely in the expensive luxury of
meat eating at the present prices.
Very few people realize what they buy
when ordinary meals are purchased.- In
the first place, almost every piece of meat
purchased In the market has a large quan
tity of refuse, viz.: the bones, gristle, ten
dons and other parts unsuitable for the
table. ..â¢.â¢.-â¢,-: Â¦V/.;: Â¦Â¦*â¢ Â¦' .
WHAT TO EAT IF MEAT IS DEAR.

These, of course, are put In at standard
rates, and the result is that the actual
meat which is fit for consumption, for
which say 20 cents a pound is paid in the
market, is worth 25 or 30 cents a pound be
fore it is ready for cooking. A glance at
the table expressing :the percentage , of
refuse in animal foods is most interesting.
In the case of the trimmings of the loin,
as high as 57 per cent has been -found to
be refuse, and the percentage in any kind
of meats rarely falls below 10. If we
should place the average percentage of
the refuse in beef of all kinds, as pur
chased in the market, at 25, it would prob
ably be below rather than above the true
figure. . . .
Then, after the refuse is cut away, the
purchaser buys an immense quantity, of
water. In some parts of beef, and beef
may be taken as a type of all meats in
general, the percentage of water rises
above 70. -
In a sample of meat which was prepared
for canning, purposes, under the super
vision of an agent of the Bureau of Chem
istry, in the Department of Agriculture,
it was. found that after removing the
bones and other refuse portions and pass
in'g 306 pounds of, the meat thus prepared
through- a sausage cutter a sample of the
average meat secured contained ;71.17 per
cent of water. Â¦ Â¦ , ' Â¦ - V . ,:
The average percentage of .water in
meats, of course, Is" not so high; but after
losing 25 per cent of the meat in refuse,
the purchaser can safely. count upon hav
ing 50 per, cent of the rest of the meat
consist of water. So, after all, I in pur
chasing ; meats . in general:, in' the open
market, only about 25" per .cent of the
total i weight received can be regarded as
of nutritive value. - v Â¦ : Â¦ -
At the early breakfasts which Ameri
cans'are wont to indulge in. that is a
hearty , before going to -their dally
work, the omission of meat is. to be
earnestly advised. Many of the ordinary
breakfast foods are to be preferred,
especially oatmeal, with sugar and cream,
and this, together with a couple of eggs,
a, few slices of toast and a cup of cotiee,
makes a breakfast which is entirely suf
ficient for the man' of sedentary employ-
ment, and with a little addition of mate
rials of the same kind quite enough for
a laboring man. 'Â¦
In so far. as actual nourishment is con
cerned, the very cheapest and best that
can be secured is presented by the cereals,
viz. : Indian corn, .wheat, oats, rye, rice,
etc. These bodies contain all the nourish
ment necessary to supply the waste of
the body and the energy and heat neces
sary 'to all animal Â¦ functions and ' hard
labor, in a- form well suited to digestion
and capable not only of maintaining the
body in a perfect condition, but also of
furnishing the energy necessary to the
hardest kind of manual labor.
' The waste material in cereals is very
small, and as; compared with that in
meats, there is practically none at all. In
fact, the ordinary wastes, such as the
bran and germ, are among the most
nutritive components of . the cereals, and
both- health and. economy would. be con
served; as a rule, ; by their consumption
instead oi' rejecting them as in the ordi
nary processes of milling. ;
The ordinary cereals of commerce con-
marketed in time to prepare for next
season's crop of celery.
Though even a careless cultivation of
celery will bring some returns,, the indus
try demands great care and attention if it
is to yield the highest profits. The seed

TEN years or so ago the land around
Westminster, in Orange County,
was a mere swamp, overgrown
with willows and tules, and haunt
ed by nocks of wild fowl. The
drier parts served as feeding grounds for
hundreds of wild hogs, which grew fat
upon the rich and abundant vegetation.
The hunting of these hogs afforded the
young men of the neighborhood plenty
of good sport. By and by it was obsorv
eU that the hogs were able to keep in
good condition at all seasons because of
the great quantity of wild celery grow
ing in the peat-lands. The idea occurred
to some reflective farmers that land so
well suited to the growth of wild celery
and incidentally to the fattening of wild
hogs ougrht to be convertible Into some
thing more profitable than a mere hunt
ing ground; in fact, it ought to produce
cultivated celery. .
Hitherto celery had been raised chiefly
in New York, Illinois, Michigan and Flor
ida, but the consumption was increasing
so rapidly throughout the United States
that the Eastern growers were not able
to supply as much of the commodity as
was wanted. One cf the largest shippers
of celery at this time was JD. E. Smt-lt
zer. of the firm of D. E. Smeltzer & Co.,
of Kansas City, who got their supply
from a firm in Tecumseh. Mich. The de
mand for celery at last became so great
that the firm found the Michigan supply,
which ceased entirely about the middle
of November, quite inadequate. Accord
ingly Mr. Smeltzer came out to Califor
nia to look for land adapted to the cul
ture of celery, and. in conjunction with
Mr. E. A. Curtis, now general manager
of the vegetable department of the Earl
Fruit Company, experimented on a tract
of land to the south of Westminster, but
unsuccessfully. Mr. Curtis, however,
clung to the idea and persuaded the Earl
Fruit Company to take up the project.
At this time celery was raised for the
Los Angeles market by a few Chinese
gardeners, who produced in small quan
tities a vegetable of only moderate qual
ity. Some of these Chinese gardeners
were hired and work began on a tract of
eighty acres, the Earl Fruit Company
paying the rent of the land, digging
wells and supplying the seed and nec
essary implements. But the white la
borers in the district were ill disposed
toward the Chinese, whom they annoyed
and intimidated so that it was hard to
keep them, at work. The white men car
ried their bad feeling to the length of
setting fire to the buildings of the Earl
Fruit Company and carrying off the im;
plements of cultivation. Yet, in spite of
all these hindrances, a crop was raised
and about fifty carloads of celery were
shipped to New York and Kansas City.
Though the damage to the crop from lack
of proper cultivation had been serious,
and though considerable expense had
been incurred in affording police protec
tion to the Chinese laborers, the venture
showed a small gain, demonstrating that
under favorable conditions the industry
would be highly profitable.
Taking advantage of this experiment,
Mr. Smeltzer, after diligent search, de
cided that the peat-lands of Orange
County were most suitable for celery
growing. He bought twenty acres and
found the returns from them so satis
factory that he now controls, either .as
owner or lessee. 500 acres, and is the
largest grower and shipper in California;
while the Kansas City firm of which he
is managing partner is the greatest ship
per of celery in the world. The Smelt
zer celery ranch is about ten miles to tho
west of Santa Ana and is one of the
largest enterprises of its kind in the
United States. A branch line of the
Southern Pacific Railway runs to the
ranch, which has a depot of its own
named Smeltzer's Station. The crop ia
generally sent to market from November
15 to March 15; and, as soon as it is dis
posed of, cabbages are planted, which are
THt. present high prices of meat have
led to many inquiries concerning tha
possibility of securing cheaper food
products which may be regarded as
substitutes for the high-priced
meats. Vegetarianism is likely to become
the fad if the present prices continue, not
bo much by reason of any superior merit
of its principles as because economical
considerations compel its adoption.
There is 1 no doubt of the fact that meat
eating is not essential to human life, and
that man can be nourished, and well nour
ithed, without resorting to a flesh diet.
The principal argument for the use of
meat is based upon taEte, since it is ad
mitted by all that the function of foods,
bo far as the human animal is concerned
at least, extends considerably beyond tho
necessities of nutrition.
Food is a factor in social economy and
an Important one in domestic economy.
Not only do we demand that our food be
nutritious, but also that it be palatable.
Just at the present time, however, the
necessities of nutrition are pre-eminent,
and questions are presented which de
mand careful scientific and technical
study.
Without going into the question of the
cause of the high prices, it will b.e th-3

but the grand cake, the huge confection
with Its lofty ornaments and orange

the one that It borrowed.

or three strong ones. If you refuse to be
forced by partner, or pass a sure winning
card, it is an imperative call for trumps.
One of the best trumps signals is mads
by a single discard. Tha discard of an
eight or abova of a suit not yet led
would be a command for trumps. *
The effectiveness of this trump signal
lies In tha fact that it is made by the
play of a single card, and if partner, is in
at the time, the call is answered at once,
without giving the opponents an oppor
tunity to take advantage of the Informa
tion in any way. This single-card call by
discard Is particularly forcible If made
early In the play of the hand. If made
late In the. hand, It Is subject to certain
modifications made evident by the former
play..
There are certain conditions under
which you may refuse'to answer the call,
especially if N made late in' the hand, if
your â¢ right-hand opponent also completes/

CT\ HROUGH a raging storm, with a
I maniac engineer at the throttle of
' I the locomotive, sped the Grand
1 Trunk international limited express
J^ train one night last week with hun
dreds of passengers aboard.
No stops were made. The train whirled
by Btations bo fast that to the terrorized
passengers they seemed but blurs of light.
On, en flashed the long line of swaying
coaches, dragged by the demoniac loco
motive that left a cloud of black smoke
and twinkling sparks In its wake. For 68
miles, from Goodells to Flint, the wild
train eped without a stop.
The throttle "vras wide open, the rate of
epeed was sometimes fully 70 miles an
hour, and the stalwart man who stood
ever It was ghastly pale, wild-eyed and
oete'rroined. The fireman tried to circum
vent him by planning for the steam to
pet low, but with the cunning. of the In
sane, the engineer divined his purpose,
end forced him to feed the coal into the
Astounded Etation agents, almost swept
from their feet as they stood on their
platforms and caw the train sweep by in
:ts mad flight, wired the train dispatcher
that something was wrong with the lim
ited: that she was making no stops and
was going at a terrific speed, and that
her engineer was either dead or crazy.
Hastily the track ahead was cleared.
Fr&ight and passenger trains were
ehunted on sidings. and the flying
Etreak of coaches was given right of way.
There was no possibility of stopping the
train. All that could be done was to
keep the track clear and trust to fortune
that something would bring the runaway
to a stop.
The fireman lived a lifetime every mo
ment. It seemed, as he waited for the end.
Of course it would be madness to Jump,
but he fancied that would be his only
chance for life. ; _
He crouched, shaking as If with the
chill of death, whiter than the crazed en
gineer, who now and then glared at him
threateningly. -
At intervals, in obedience to a com
manding gesture of the maniac, the fire
man threw open the door of the coalbox
and tossed shovelfuls of coal Into the
roaring furnace.
At one time the fireman conceived the
desperate scheme of pushing the engin
eer from the cab if he should for a mo
ment leave his post at the throttle.
The chance never came. The engineer
stood like a figure of steel at his post.
He trpoke not a word, and the only time
he moved was when he gestured for more
CO 2-1
Everything on board was all right when
the train drew away from Port Huron.
"Billy" Brown of Battle Creek, one of
the old stand-by engineers of the road,
was at the throttle. It was just after the
train passed through the tunnel under the
Et Clair River, only a few miles out of
Port Huron, that the crew and passengers
began to notice the peculiar conduct- of
the engineer, as shown by the eccentric
movements of the train.
First came a burst of epeed. Then the
brakes were applied with a suddenness
that sent passengers tumbling over seat
backs. Those who left their seats in ex
citement were hurled headlong to the
floor. As the miles were passed the speed
increased, the rain beat upon the car win
dows and great flashes of lightning made
the sky lurid with their recurrent glow.
Helpless and pale, the passengers sat
clinging to their seats, believing that they
must soon meet with some terrible acci
dent. It seemed impossible for the train
to remain on the rails, and the passengers
were tossed from Bide to side as the
curves were rounded. A sullen roar could
be heard as a freight train on a siding
was passed; a flash would tell that a sta
tion had been left in the wake of the fly
ing train.
From Capac, where the first stop was
scheduled, but past which the train
whirled, without so much as a warning
whistle, messages were sent on ahead to
Imlay City, Lapeer, Davidson and Flint
tc clear the track. Freights were side
tracked and passenger trains were held
up.
Imlay City was passed at hurricane
speed. Members of the crew tried to climb
over the tender to the engine cab, but the
train rocked 60 fast that they were forced
to give up the attempt.
The city of Lapeer flashed by, a long
stream of twinkling lights. Davidson ap
peared and vanished.
The word had gone out that No. 5 was
being driven by a crazy engineer, and
though the hourâ 11:07 p. m. â was late,
the depot platform was crowded with
spectators to see the wildcat train, and
the limited went by at seventy miles an
hour.
Without the sound of a bell the old en
gine came around the curve and into the
Flint yards, nearly a mile away from' the
station. Slowly, oh so slowly, to the anx
ious watchers, the headlight drew nearer
as the train crept in under brakes. Men
belonging to other engines stood ready to
board the locomotive if she did not stop at
the station; but slower and slower, as the
airbrakes were set and the throttle was
closed, the heavy train, with its load of
frightened passengers, came to a dead
stop.
On board the train It had at first been
supposed that the locomotive had suffered
an accident. The . truth was disclosed
when the conductor and brakeman went
forward. :-f..-v -
There they . saw Brown at his post,
erect and looking ahead. The fireman was
throwing In coal. No one could under
stand what was the matter. The con
ductor cried out at Brown, but he paid no
heed.
The fireman looked up to explain mat
ters. Brown grasped him by the neck
and threw him back violently. .
Then those who watched gained the first
hint that Brown -had gone insane.
The distance between the baggage car
and the tender was several feet. One of
the men attempted to reach the tender.
He would have fallen and been ground
Into bits had his companions not caught
him. Other attempts were equally fruit
less. . '
It finally became evident that no one
would be able to cross, and the men slm-
RIDING ON AN EXPRESS TRAIN AT SEVENTY
MILES AN HOUR WITH A CRAZY
ENGINEER AT THE THROTTLE
ply stood there, watching engineer and
fireman as the glare from the open fire
box lighted up the interior of the cab,
waiting for the end.
No one knows what wild plans were
formed in Brown's crazy mind. Perhaps
he thought that some great heroic en
deavor was demanded by him, and knew
he was facing death just as well as '.his
fireman knew it.
Equally mysterious is the motive which
finally induced him to bring the train to
a standstill.
His condition when relieved indicated
plainly that he had been under a heart
breaking strain, one that in Itself might
have wrecked a healthy mind.
The passengers, crying aloud in their
excitement, poured out of the coaches as
though afraid the mad engineer would
open the throttle and whirl them away
again.
"Our engineer is crazy!" was the cry
from dozens of throats, while others were
so overcome by excitement that they
could-hot speak. Some were found, how
ever, who could give the story of their
thrilling ride at seventy miles an hour.
Engineer Brown was ill when taken
from the cab by the railroad men and
carried into the station. His face was
ghastly, his eyes staring into vacancy.
Hjs fireman, William Hodgson, weak and
trembling, sat on the opposite side of the
cab, so unstrung that it was some min
utes before he could tell his story.
Â» "We were just out of Goodells," j he
finally said, "when Brown began to act
queer. I never saw anything like it and
it frightened me, for I had heard of en
gineers going insane and driving their
engine like mad, with open throttle and
a full head of steam.
"When I began to let thÂ© steam go
down in the hope that the train would
slow down enough for some One to board
us. Brown insisted upon my firing up;
As he is so much larger and more power
ful than I, the matter of tackling him
and trying to overpower him did not ap
peal to me.
"Brown kept me at the firebox throw
ing in the coal for all I was worth and
sending the train at a rate of speed I
never traveled at before and do cot wish
to travel at again.
"If ever I lifted my voice In prayer It
was when I saw the train slacken speed
as it came into the Flint yard, almost
hoping against hope that a stop would be
made, and when the brakes were put on
I almost shouted with joy."
The hundreds of excited passengers
. stood around the train, and It required
some coaxing . to â¢ get them into the
coaches again. Engineer George Cassady
of this city, driver of the yard engine,
was placed on the passenger locomotive
and took the train throueh to Battle
Creek, the end of the division.
Brown was carried on the train and
taken to his home in .Battle Creek. A
commission of physicians has decided
that the engineer was made temporarily

of course. One of the Boers surrendered Â»
ttiat day and told the English officers of
our meeting. Then it was that my trou
bles began.
"Next morning, October 12, 1901, I was
busy with seven patients, in my office
when one Wilson, the commandant there,
came to arrest me. Before this, fortu
nately, in some way I had sent my wife
with most of my money to America. I
was in absolute ignorance as to what they
wanted. I thought perhaps they came
to buy some horses or commandeer them.
'Something more Important than your'
business is on hand,' was the reply when
I said that I was very busy. This Wil
son was one of the many grocery men or
merchants whom the Britsh made ths
grave mistake of advancing to the rank
or office of commandants. Their local
prejudices worked havoc in many ways
and cases, especially when martial law
made a great change in caste and author
ity. Many troubles were largely due to
these petty "" officers. My case was only
saved by ..going to hlgher^quarters. They
took my keys from me when I was .ar-
through a capitalist of Pretoria, and of
fered him my services.
"We saw him In the drawing-room of
his Dutch style house, that compared
then with the best. He sat in a big arm
chair looking out of the window and at
m" escort's greeting of 'Morgen, Presi
dent,' he looked up at us with those in
flamed eyes set in his rather heavy face.
Th> trouble was with his eyelids and it
Increased so that almost all of his read
ing had to be done for him. To show the
spirit of the man and his cause, his first
remark after he had been told that I
wanted to do ambulance work was very
significant. He said: 'Did you bring a
gun with you? We have no use for am
bulance men, we only want men with
guns.' And In a v,-ay that seemed true,
for on their side I never saw, taken all
in all, so few casualties. In the four
months that I was at the front with them
after that doing ambulance work I my
self only saw seven dead men and my
ambulance wagons, which I called the
American train only sheltered 212 men
from seven distinct fights. It was not
long before this that I had married and
these seven engagements that I was in
were a source of great anxiety to my
wife. Most of my time was spent on a
horse right in the firing line, a red cross
on my hat and sleeve and on my back a
little package of bandages.
"During this time I met M. J. Steyn,
President of the Orange Free State.
whose wife, by the way, was a Scotch
woman, a Miss "Fraser. He was educated
in Edinburgh. When I met him his 'mov
ing capital,' as they called it, was at
Kronstadt, where the Volksraad was hav- J
ing sessions In the dining-room of the '
Palmer Hotel. Like many of the Boers
his religion was always in evidence, but
when he said grace at dinner you were
leminded that it was largely a matter of
form, for it was said so rapidly that
after the first three words it was just
a -Frist!'
"Between Bloemfontein and Brandfort I
got my first taste of a real hot engage
ment. My general was Delarey, one of
the best of the Boer generals. On one oc
casion 1 found myself right between the
Boer and English lines, with the shells
coming like hailstones. One of these* hiss
ing whls'tles seemed to single Itself nut
and come right for me. I bowed over my
horse's neck and felt the pressure of the
shell as it grazed my back. It exploded
twenty-five feet in front of my horse and
fairly blew him up in the air, but without
doing him serious injury; One rock In
those it scattered struck me.
"The horse seemed a part of the Boers,
for all of them were mounted in fighting.
A shell burst in the midst of a group Ot-
Boers not a hundred yards fronv me with
a marvelous result. The only damage was
one man with a broken collarbone and
one horse injured out of the. group of six
ty or seventy mounted men.
"A false impression that some people
have regarding the Boers is that they are
an ignorant class of men> In all my trav
els I never met, a Boer who could not
read and write. The strict regard m
which they hold their religion is one of
the causes of this condition. They are all
church members, and each churchman
must read in order to be able to pass the
confirmation examination. ,
"After the J. all of Bloemfontein I went
down to Cape Town and asked for work
in the camp hospitals. The British need
ed surgeons then, and I accepted a posi- \
tlon as medical officer on one of the large
transports bound for England. After dis
charging my cargo all right and having a j
few days to spare before my steamer
sailed to South Africa, I concluded to
take a run over to the Paris Exposition.
By a mere coincidence the next room to

which all came out and was used against
me at my 'trial after my arrest. But I
could not have furnished them any in
formation had I wished, for 1 had been
away from the Transvaal for months.
"When I got back to South Africa I set
tled down to practice at Craddock. I had
an immense practice and the Boers re
garded me as friendly. I was not molest
ed for over a year. One day I was called
out in the country. to see a sick Boer.
There I .met a commando, and M. H.
Wessels, my wife's brother, was with
them- I hadn't seen him since he went
to England to college and did not know
he was on commando. I talked with him.

guiltless as any in existence of the crime

planks that served as a bed, raised a lit

continually the ghastly flight of the bul
lets that had ended the lives of two spies
the day before. From the corners jeered
the face of the rebel Coetze. who had gone
from the same cell to be hanged not many
months before. Words cannot . tell nor
colors paint the scenes and longings that

his Â¦wife and family here in San Francis
co, surprising them when they were still
In doubt as to his liberation from prison.
For more than, six months he had had no
communication with or letters from
them.
Dr. Anthony's arrest and trial by the
English as a supposed spy in the interest
of the Boers created quite a sensation In
this country and it has scenes and inci
dent in its course that make the story
read like a novel. Hard as it all was for
him, it was harder for his wife, who. al
most driven crazy at the thought of her
husband's imminent peril, went to Wash
ington to urge through interviews with
Secretary Hay and a number of Senators
that justice be secured for an American
citizen. This secured the intervention of
the State Department in his behalf, and
Dr. Anthony says that his wife was pri
marily the chief factor "in bringing about
his release. Mrs. Anthony was a mem
ber of the Wessels family, one of the old
est and most prominent in Soutb Africa,
before she met her husband during his
second trip to Cape Town. She is an own
cousin of President Steyn of the Orange
Free State, and niece of C. H. Wessels,
one of the envoys from the South African
republic.
It was through one of these envoys' that
the wife first heard of the arrest and sub
sequent peril of her husband. After his
final release, Dr. Anthony, in March last,

and Liverpool to New York. He did not
escape British espionage till he reached
New York, however, for he was shadowed
by an English detective. He tells his story
In an interesting way, that takes one into
exciting happenings.
"I was twice arrested and practically
sentenced to death and I spent altogether
102 days in South African prisons, an ex

they have not, for all African jails are

British Medical Association and had
many good friends among the English. I
went first to South Africa In 1886 and re
mained several years before returning to
America. Then in 1SS5 1 started again
fcr Cape Town, where I expected to set

took up tverk in the sanitarium and hos

I gave up half of it to the use of wound

Â¦was given the title of major. When the
â¢war broke out I applied for a position to
accompany the imperial ambulance corps,
but most of the places were appropriated
by young Englishmen and I did not know
military tactics as did the other surgeons.
Being disqualified from this I crossed the
border end it was then I met Oom Paul,
working up my case, but employed two
advocates from Cape Town, the best tal
ent In ' the colony. I was acquitted fair
and square and at once cabled the fact to
my wife, though it was. two months be

"I then returned to Craddock, later a
hotbed of Boer rebels, and Intended to

applied to Wilson, my old friend, the
commandant who first arrested me. for a
pass to Cape Town and it was refused
me. He was indignant at my acquittal,
and as it turned out was putting In his
spare time working up other evidence
against me.
"In about three weeks I had a com
munication ordering me to return to
Graaf Reinert to be tried on a charge of
perjury. It was said that I had given
false evidence in my first trial. I went
of my own free will this time to Graaf
Reinert.
"I was thrown in prison again, among
the common prisoners of .war, but in a
jail more filthy, if possible, than the first.
A big tub stood in the little yard, where
not a blade of grass grew, and this tub
served for the bathing of all the pris
oners, if they cared to risk It. I was in
formed that death would probably be the
finish of me this time, for my case was
very grave. Commandants Scheepers
and Kritzinger occupied cells on either
side of mine. Scheepers' trial was in
progress. He was convicted, and Kritz

his execution.
"In fourteen days my trial came off

urging my American citizenship. for all I

I had a chance to see what the other
prisoners were fed on. At 6 a. m. each
man received a rusty tin bowl contain

you can't blame them, much for
arresting me, for there were some
circumstances that must have seem

Lay said to me when I saw him in Wash-
"But all this time my wife had been
working for me, and the very next day
came a dispatch from "W. R. Bigham, the
American Consul at Cape Town, saying
that he had received a cable from the
Government" at Washington to see that
justice was shown me and wanting me to
send him full particulars of my case. This
Information I sent him in a sealed en
velope under the consular service. The
seal I used was the end of my tooth brush
indented by the prongs of a fork.
"The jailer, who had known me well,
was kind and gave me some favors in re
turn for an operation which I performed
on him for a growth in the nose. Through
the kindness of the magistrate I was al
lowed to get my Instruments and removed
twenty-eight polypi from the man's nose.
In all the time I never made any move to
appeal to the American Government,
awaiting my trial, which was delayed
from time to time. On the night of the
sixty-third day the commandant came to
me In the darkness and told me that he
'supposed I realized the gravity of the
charge against me, and if I had any mes
sages I wanted to send to my wife or
family I had better prepare them and
make my will.' That was the night that
sleep and I were total strangers.
"For sixty-five days I was kept In this
living' tomb, with a practical sentence of
death hanging over me. I found that bail
was refused me. though Mrs. "Wessels. my
wife's grandmother, wired from Cape
Town that she would furnish $50,000, or
Â£10,000, if I were released. I was allowad
hotel fare in my captivity, for which I
had to pay $5 per day.
"The Captain of Police read from a long
blue paper something which broke Into
the suspense In which I had been kept

i not establish a new

especially attractive, with the pretty soft
flesh tints seeming all the; fairer and
lovelier, for the contrasting tone of tha
large hat . which surmounts her queenly
head, why shouldn't she be permitted to
follow this, very becoming style?
Artists, even the thoroughly, up-to-date
ones; approve of bare shoulders and hats,
or. they- wouldn't insist upon posing their
subjects in this particular dress.
â¢Thus it happens that dainty femininity
has conceived a bold scheme of setting a
new fashion, and already attempts are
being made to make decollete frocks and
picture hats the vogue for certain func

WHY is it that Ijvc-.y wLw+u s

Gainsborough chose to portray
his beautiful subjects in this picturesque
fashion, it has been copied extensively

The effect is undeniably picturesque and
lovely, so my lady sits for her portrait In
this fantastic costume, which certainly
would appear altogether stagy if it were
not that smart society has approved of
the combinationâ pictorially, co far.
According to good style e'venlng gowns
accompanied by large hats have not been
considered appropriate, except for fancy
dress affairs and picture weddings, and

The Whitened Locks.
While gray hair Is honorable it is not al
ways pretty or becoming. Seldom does
the possessor enjoy it. To prevent gray
hair there Is nothing like taking care of
the hair while the roots are young and
vigorous. A shampoo once a month, a
little light brushing twice a week for tlve
minutes with a soft brush, letting down
the hair at night, dressing it in different
ways so that the plna do not come al
ways on the same spots, nourishing Ihe
roots with a good tonicâ all these things
tend to keep the hair from growing gray.
Roots that have grown feeble can be
stimulated by a light massage. , Lift the
hair lightly with the fingers. Just so that
the scalp Is massaged by the .flc&er tips.
This is the treatment advised for^fchose
who find the hair gray or out of condi
tion. >
Golden hair is frequently produced by
shampooing the hair with hot water, la
which a little kitchen soda is dissolved.
The soap should be kitchen soap, and aft
er it is rinsed off then the washing soda
is used; finally the hair la well rinsed and
dried In the sun. This will generally
brighten hair that la inclined to be of a
drabbish hue, instead of the ruddy gold
that la so much admired. But the pro
cess is apt to be harmful and is not rec
ommended.
A correspondent who signs herself Mrs.
J. R. writes that her hair ia getting thin
and that she dreads baldness. "I wash
my hair often," says she, "and brush It
for fifteen minutes every night before re
tiring. Yet it continues to come out."
The latest theory in hair preservation
is that hair can be best preserved by let
ting it alone. A limited amount of
neglect improves the hair.
This Is particularly demonstrated in thÂ«
case of men who become bald, universal
ly, at an early age. Poor men, who work
hard and have no time to spend upon
shampoos- and fancy brushes, do not com
plain of baldness. It Is the man of
wealth, the one who washes his head at
least once a day, and may be three times.
who brushes it vigorously a dozen times
a day with a stiff hairbrush, who puts on
perfumes and who otherwise Ill-treats his
scalpâ this is the man who becomes bald.
The man, with, less time and opportunity;
preserves his head of hair all hla life.
The woman who finds herself getting
bald should not use a hairbrush any
oftener than Is absolutely necessary: sha
should not wash her head more frequent
ly than once in six weeks; she should use
no alcohol on her head; she should not
wear a switch if she can help it; and sha
should give her hair a chance.
Don't worry the roots. Hs$lr is the hard
est thing in the world to kill. Let it alone
and you will never be bald; or your
chances will be greatly lessened.

feet of Sngtish in) omen.
Much has been said both in Jest and
seriously about the size of English wo
men's feet. The fact is that when all
things are considered they are not ab*
normally large. The English girl of toÂ«
day Is tallâ tall In a sense and to a de
gree that the Gibson cartoons of the
stately American girl do not even adum
brate.
In the aristocratic set more often than
not she towers over the heads of for
eign gentlemen. Long generations of
descent from tall fathers and mothers of
vigorous years of outdoor exercise have
made her what she isâ very occasionally
a six-footer and with hands and feet In
proportion.
The note of alarm has at last been
sounded. It is held that "the daughters
of Anak" are exercising too freely if
they would wear the dainty shoes that
are women's traditional ornament.
While the answer is made that the ap-"
parent size of the English girl's foot is
due to her sensible preference for loose,
easy shoes, it is admittedly an incom
plete explanation.
One reason for the growing popularity
\f tho American shoe in London is that

water one egg and add a few drops of
ammonia.
A Brisk Shampoo.
In dealing with mixtures in which there
Is ammonia or melted soap a great deal of
care must be taken that the eyes are not
Injured. It is best to have an assistant
who will operate the soapy mixture while
the patient rests her head against the
edge of the wash basin, a towel held to
her eyes.
This mixture should lather easily and is
Intended for the massage of the scalp and
hair. Never rub soap directly upon the
hair, for it sticks and cannot be removed
with ever so many washings, but the mix
ture, on the other hand, is easily man
aged.
In washing clothes it is the custom to
allow them to remain a while In the suds.
60, in washing the hair, the head should
remain saturated for a few minutes that
the soapy water may do Its cleansing
work. " Let ths operator manipulate the
suds for, say, five minutes.
The rinsing should be done with a
spray. The little sprayer with which
flowers are sprinkled is better than noth
ing-, but It really costs so little to own a
pipe of rubber with a sprinkler attached
to it that most women are willing to af
ford the little luxury.
The water should be hot at first, then
cold. With home-made contrivances it to
difficult to regulate the heat, but It can 1
be done, and the result Is a clean, smooth,
sweet-smelling scalp.
The matter of drying Is managed in va
fious ways, one of which Is by continual
fanning. Stretching the hair out in the
sun is good, while hanging It before a
grate fire, if the weather will permit, Is
best of all. However It is done, the hair
should be well dried and there should be
no thick, clinging feeling to it.
A dainty custom of scenting the locks
comes from Paris. . A little . cap of fine
muslin, filled with sachet powder. Is
slipped on over the head and the hair la
bundled up into It A permanent scent is
thus imparted.
Scenting the Hair.
An excellent scent for the hair Is made
from oil of rose geranium. Take a few
drops of the oil and add, a third of the
quantity of glycerine. Pour upon absorb
ent cotton and roll the cotton round and
round until quite a piece Is moistened.
Now spread out the cotton until It makes
a flat piece like a pancake and sew it
into thin silk. This can be placed in the
crown of the .little scented cap to Im
part extra fragrance to the hair. Be care
ful, and remember that you are dealing
with an oil. If left on more than fifteen
minutes it will oil the hair too much.
All sorts' of devices for perfuming the
hair are employed, one. of. these being the
tying of a ribbon around the head at
night to which are attached little soft
cachet bags, all hanging from ribbons of
different lengths.
No hair scent is ever permanent. It
must be often renewed. Just as your din
ner must be eaten daily, so also must your
Bcent sachet' give forth Its daily supply.
When you come to think of It, perfum
ery should not "last"â should not be ex
pected to do so. But it should be re
newed every day.
Hair which shows dandruff In an un
pleasant manner needs shampooing. That
Is the first step in its cure. Often that
which is mistaken for dandruff Is merely
dust and wrtl disappear if the hair be
treated frequently to a shampoo. But in
no case should the hair be washed more
frequently than once in two weeks.
Nothing cures^ dandruff as quickly as
oiling the head. This seems to heal the
scalp and remove all tendency to a scaly
condition.
But oil. on the other hand, is unpleas
ant,'and the scalp must : be cured without
causing the hair to become greasy o'r to
suffer in any way.

There may have been some time a

head.' But if bo her name is not on rec

had heads of hair, or at least they have
had hair that could be prettily arranged,
and the records have yet to tell of a
woman who could be pretty in spite of
poor hair.
The low-growing hair, giving the fore
head that wide, calm look which is de
manded by certain types of beauty, does
not belong to all. Nor are the curling

WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE BUT A FOLD OF PAPER STAND BETWEEN YOU AND DEATH
German about thirty years ago met a
Mexican who had worked the mine in the
eld days when Arizona was a part of
Sonora. His operations were interrupted
by attacks made on his employes by In
dians and he abandoned the enterprise,
taking home with him rich gold ore. This
Mexican was a man of means, and not
caring to undergo the risk of a second
attempt gave the mine to his German
friend. '
Having obtained from his Mexican ac-
qualntance a map of the country and a
fully detailed description of the property,
the German went to Tucson and enlisted
the aid of a fellow countryman of his in
searching for the lost mine. Following
their written directions % they proceeded to
tbe south side of the Superstitipn Moun
tain,, and entering the first long draw
east of the west end of the mountain they
succeeded in finding the trail designated
on the map. This led them across the
mountain and down a long ridge past

efforts on the part of Walker to resusci

fore his death, however, he gave Walker
instructions as to how to reach the mine
and turned over to. him the ore he had
brought away from the scene of the trag-
Weavers Needle, into a deep canyon,

was situated. The undergrowth was so

showed them that they had acted too,
fcostily and had killed workmen of their
Mexican friend, who were still endeavor
ing to work the mine. Being considerably
frightened and fearing the consequences
of their rash deed they hastily gathered
up the ore that was already taken out
and proceeded to beat a precipitate re
treat. Retribution was at hand, however,
and the Apaches, whom they had feared,
having been attracted to the spot by the
firing, made a furious attack upon them.

were not better than even. Prospecting
was dangerous and most of the frontier
characters hovered under military pro
tection at Fort McDowell: - Several de
tachments of troops were: In the Four
Peaks region, some at guard at points of
vantage and others scouring the country â¢
for Indian siens.
The prospectors reached a point about
twenty-eight miles from Fort McDowell.
Here; skirting the foothills of the Four
Peaks, they discovered placer ground and
began operations. The second day the
gravel banks revealed a myriad of colors
and the prospectors were elated over the
promise of enough gold to make nabobs
of them . all. That afternoon, with their
single pan, they took but several hundred
dollars of gold dust to add to the value
of three large nuggets discovered.
At sundown they were appalled by a
phenomenon which the gold diggers re
garded as an evil omen. The Four Peaks
seemed to be drawing' toward them.
Whether It was a mirage or eccentricity
of nature they could not determine to*
their own satisfaction. The sound - ; of
cannon suddenly played on their appre
hensive ears and they fled from the^ plac
ers. It was a series Of signal shots from
some of the troops in the mountains above
them, and shortly afterward the rever
- berating peal of the big cannon at Fort
McDowell was a warning that Indians ap
proached and whites who valued their
. lives should move.
At that time Victoria was the fighting
chief of the Apaches. He had sent an
army of 1600 braves up the Salt River
and a band of 400 was planning to join it
to move on the regulars while the forces
were weak. .
The three gold-diggers lost no time in
making their way to Tucson, where they I
sold their gold dust. The party went to
Tombstone, where they bound themselves
that no one of them should return to the
placers without the companionship of the
remaining two. They planned to return
Â¦when the Indians should "become less dan
gerous.
Martinelli eventually was hanged by
horsethieves because he had furnished
"vigilantes" with information against
Rodig's experiences date back to 1876,
when he and his comrade were on the
frontier facing pioneer privations and
dodging behind big rocks to keep from be
ing killed by the Indians. With Jack
Reed and Pete Martinelli ' he set out for
edy. The map and written descriptions
of the location of the property had been
carried off by the other German, who had
come to the settlement on the north side Â¦
of the Salt River. Being too busy at that
time to investigate the story, Walker al
lowed the matter to rest for several
years, and it was not until 1SS1 that he
took occasion to make the matter public.
He has never had time to investigate the
supposed location, of -the mine, as he was
since then fully occupied in looking after
the affairs of the Vekol mine.
In 1S05 it came to light that the second
fugitive had been living in Mesa, Ariz.,
with a Mexican woman and that he made
occasional excursions into the Supersti
tion Mountains, bringing back with him
large gold- nuggets. Two years later,
when he was at the point of death, ha
made an attempt to reveal his secret, but
died before he could tell the story. He
gasped the name of "Weaver," by which
he probably intended to convey that old
John Weaver, the hermit of the Supersti
tion Mountains, knew the secret of the
Lost Dutchman. If Weaver knew he died
with the scret in his breast Few ven
tured to visit the old recluse who, in the
heart of the Apache country, retired in a
cave, the opening of which was festooned .
by the scalps of g Mesevelero's braves.
Weaver, disappointed in love in St. Louis,
spent thirty years in a lonely canyon in
the mountains caring little for worldly
matters and less for gold. He picked off
many an Apache who endeavored to in
vade the sanctity of his cave until the
Indians avoided him in the terror of their
superstitions. Importunities of his
friends to induce him to mingle with the
world were as unavailing as their at- â¢
tempts to learn from him the locations of
gold ledges with which he was undoubt
edly familiar. "Bear" Weaver he was
sometimes called, because his- only recre
ation was in hunting bears, and because
he' made a vow ten years before his
death that he should never again comb
his hair or beard as penitence for having
missed a fine shot at a bear. His matted
locks and beard testified how well he ad
hered to the vow.
A shoemaker living in Phoenix has been
encouraged by the rediscovery of the Lost
Dutchman to make one more search for a
' rich ledge somewhere near that property.
His name is Charles Rodig. He, discov
ered the ledge many years ago, but after
'Â¦ his first visit he has been unable to find
s it again. At Intervals he still persists in
r the search, having made five trips in all,
1 . and shortly he will go -again.
)
them. In. several years Reed disappeared,
leaving Rodig in sole possession of th*
knowledge of the remarkable placers.
A strange series of misfortunes has
followed Rodig in his efforts to relocate
the placers. Three years ago ho and a
companion were almost drowned while
attempting to cross the Salt River In
their search. At another time he was
pitched from a horse and returned to
Phoenix with fractured bones, and there
is still another instance in which he
was ambushed by Indians on his journey
and forced Â£o flee for hi3 life.
He says tjie character of the country
has changed wonderfully since the early
days and many of t the' landmarks have
disappeared. Where there, was once a
swampy . flat to-day ' the gTound is dry
and barren. At other places where he
remembers traveling over an open coun
try there is now a heavy growth of trees
and shrubbery.
A man named Burke Tcokey came to
Phoenix recently with papers aiding in
the solution of a lost mine mystery aa re
markable as any related. He was a mem
ber of; a party which prospected in the
early days in the- Sierra Anchos, a
neighboring range 'of the Superstitions.
The prospectors were driven from rich
placer diggings^ by \ the Indians. Four
were killed andfthe single survivor, after
having received \na4'y injuries, Including
the loss of a hand and two broken ribs,
was scalped and Left '^pr dead by the sav
ages. He came 'to life, however, and
succeeded . in escaping on a burro, car
lying with him enough' gold to defray the
expenses 'of a fifteen years* treatment in
a New Mexico hospital. He- brought let
ters from the hospital vouching for a part
cf his tale at least, and interested sev
eral local capitalists, "who equipped a
party to follow" his guidance back Into
the mountains. This visitor claims to be
Burke Tookey. His condition is now pre
carious, and it is doubtful if he will live
to see the fulfilment of his dream.
LLOYD DAMRON'.
Among the many stories dealing with
loft mines and claims that have been lo
cated a second time after many trials,
tales of the "Lost Dutchman" are most
interesting because of the romantic cir
cumstances attending its discovery and
the many futile efforts that have been
trade from time to time to find it again.
This mine was located on the south side
of Salt River, near Weavers Needle. A
as it naturally happens that the miner who
is forced to abandon his claim paints the
riches of the lost vein in glittering colors
and is sooner or later able to enlist the
efforts of capitalists, dazzled with the
great posslbilites offered in finding a mine
so rich as the "Lost Dutchman" is be
lieved to be.
Many efforts have been made to locate
this and other lost ledges in that region,
Gold is one of the noblest works of the
Great Spirit in the eyes of the ignorant
Apiches and he who would rob the earth
of the glittering metal brings down the
vengeance of that tribe. Indians who
have sought to gain trinkets from the
whites by delivering gold from deposits
whose locations were secret to the red
men were held up to the scorn of their
race and cruelly tortured In consequence
of their crime against the Great Father.
"White men have shared the same fate in
attempting to secure gold in the Apache
bad lands and there is no more striking:
instance than is afforded by the "Lost
Dutchman."
The mine just found shows evidence of
having been worked years ago by white
men. There is an eighty-foot shaft and
around the mouth are scattered rusty
picks and skulls of several human beings,
which phrenologists declare are the re
mains, of white men. All these evidences
add color to the theory that the "Lost
Dutchman" was no myth, but a mine in
reality and one which will now send vast
treasures to the Government mint. Mese
velero, chief of the Apaches, guarded their
secret well, for many prospectors who
sought to enrich themselves by the treas
ures in Apache land were raided and
kil^d at the very scene of their opera
tions.
"J^ost Dutchman" mine has beer
rediscovered. A prospector found the
riches concealed under a surface which is
said to be fairly glittering: -with nuggets
and the matter taken from tbe rich vein
which teems with colors. At last, say
those who are familiar with mining in
this region, the remarkable riches of the
"Lost Dutchman" will be brought to the
attention of the world and the men who
have spent thousands of dollars in at
tempting to locate this property will have
ample time to nurse their disappointment
for not having looked further for those
riches which the superstitious Apaches
have successfully guarded from the white
men for a score of years. The cost of the
noted ledge is figured not only in dollars
but in human lives.

"The Government; "What It Is; What
It Does," by Salter Storrs Clark, is a vol-.
ume which is entirely . different from the
average cut-and-dried text book in civics.
It is more like an able teacher's. verbal
presentation of the . subject to his class
than like anything else. The style is
clear-cut, forceful and full of life. The
matter is presented -suggestively and the
pupil is led to draw inferences for him
self. Comparisons of our Government
with those of other countries are fre
quent; the Illustrations of the actual
workings of the system are detailed and
vivid, and government is shown to be a
science, a complete system, which has a
practical part in our every-day life. Sup
plementary work, giving questions which
will force the pupil to think over what
he has studied, are appended to each
chapter and a complete index is Included.

"the more frivolous Abbe de Bernis," from
whom we shall see the serious man insen

"He was born at Salnt-Marcer d'Ar

French Memoirs.
As it Is, however, this work well de
serves a place in the library of every
situdent or reader of history.
there days when indexes are so gener
ally found it is a matter for surprise that
so excellent and carefully executed a
work as this by Mr. Josselyn should not
have been provided with one.
Of a somewhat later period is Cardinal
de Bernis, who resided in Rome as Em
bassador of France from 1769, and where
he died in 1794. His was one of the most
graceful and polished minds of the last
Rene-Louis, Marquis d'Argenson, was
the eldest son of Marc-Rene, the celebrat
ed lieutenant general of police during the
last eighteen years of Louis XIV and
keeper of the seals under the regency. He
was born in October, 1694. and died in
1757. His brother, the favorite son, was
leng Minister of War' under Louis XV
and a* very .popular man. The Marquis
did not share to any 'great extent the pop
ularity of his brother at that time, but he
has come to be highly esteemed as a fair
minded man and one who had the inter
ests of his country at heart. He held Im
portant positions during his life and was
peculiarly well situated to truthfully
chronicle the happenings from the minis
try of the Due de Bourbon throughout
the whole duration of that of Cardinal de
Fleury and beyond it.
These notes and reflections will give the
reader a capital portrayal of the first
forty years. in the reign of Louis XV and
well illustrate the political and social cor
ruption that ultimately brought about the
horrors of revolution and the downfall of
royalty in France.
Naturally, in the original there was
much repetition and uninteresting mate
rial; this has been eliminated, and the
translation as it now stands in its
abridged form presents all that readers
would care for. â¢ Â¦
a iSan in his study on the men and topics
that filled his mind."
It Is to be heped that a future edition
will be provided with an index; which
would be far more handy than obtaining
the desired Information by the above pro
cess. That Is the only point lacking to
make the present book one most desir
able for handy reference. A cyclopedia
of a general character, or a diptionary,
is its own index by reason of Its alpha
betical arrangement; tut a search through
marginal readings is slow at best and In
By using the general heads and dates
as above given, which .divide the cyclo
pedia into its four parts or periods, any
student looking for some particular point
upon which he seeks enlightenment can
sift his search down to a perusal of the
marginal reference for the precise matter
desired.
Mr. Josselyn cannot be blamed in this
respect, however, for his title of cyclo
pedia shows that he has intended his
work more for reference than for general
reading. The book shows the greatest
care and hard work on the part of the
author to make as smooth reading as
possible, but the style is bound to seem
abrupt where you are constantly chang
ing from one anecdote by one author to
another on the same or a different
theme and by a different author. You no
sooner become interested along one line
than you are switched off to some other
phase or incident, as the case may be.
Unavoidably, there is considerable repe
tition; quite necessary for the good of
the book as a reference work where the
point is to get the same incident as
viewed by dlfferen. historians, but tire
some in a way to one who reads for
the incident alone and not for its vari
ation.
The book is a sort of multum in parvo
for those who would acquire a passing
acquaintance with the life of one of the
greatest generals the world has ever
known. Reading it through you should
ga: in your mind's eye "The True Napo
leon," for the parts of the volume are
made up of the writings of so many dif
ferent authors and authorities that the
effect is a composite mental picture
closely approximating the man as he ac
tually was. Further the book is of use
for practical reference to those who
would inform themselves upon some for
gotten or hazy point in their mind con
cerning Napoleon. In this matter of use
as a kind of cyclopedia lies the greatest
practical value of the volume; for in a
book made up of clippings, as it were,
there is a lack of continuity rather dic
couraging to one reading from cover to
cover.*
The other four parts of the volume
cover^ the different periods in the life of
Napoleon as follows: "Napoleon: Boy
and Man. 1767-1S21"; "The Soldier. 1790
1S15": "Emperor and- Statesman, 1799
1815"; "Exile and Philosopher, 1815-1821."
The author has picked his matter from
the writings of all the standard authori
ties who have devoted their pens to Na
poleon. He has taken a bit here and a
bit there and finally having at his com
mand all necessary to illustrate his sub
ject he has rearranged and classified it,
giving a marginal credit to the author
from whom he quotes. He divides his
book into six parts. In one he gives a
chronology of Napoleon's life and in an
other he uses under the general head of
"Napoleon: The Man of the World." an
extract from Emerson's "Representative
Men."
In his preface, Mr. Josselyn states the
purpose of his book: "It is not my pur
pose to write a life of Napoleon; this
volume is simply a compilation of anec
aotes and opinion incident to himself and
his times, and. like J. T. Headley, the
author cf 'Napoleon and His Marshals,'
I pretend to no originality except that,
like him, I have grouped what I believe
to be Interesting facts already given to
the world and have used without any
hesitation any reliable author that could
help me. It may save many who are in
terested in the life of Napoleon the
trouble of wading through many volumes
to find that which they would like to
read. The book is, as its title represents,
a dictionary of events."
Before commenting upon the text due
credit must be given to the typographical
work of the volume and the illustrations.
Some of the portraits are shown on this
page. It would be impossible to repro
duce clearly in a newspaper the details
in the battle scenes of Napoleon's career
that have been favorite themes with ar
tists, but these have been excellently well
done by half-tone process in the book
itself. The volume is also provided with
an outside cover of heavy cloth and paper
handsomely decorated that proves both
ornamental and usefuL
â¢Â¦Â» W R. CHARLES JOSSELYN, a
/\ /I Calif ornian and a prominent
I I member of the Bohemian Club
V. "* I of San Francisco, now appears
JL in the new role of author. Mr.
Josselyn has spent years of his
life in the study of Napoleon and has also
traveled extensively that he might see

"Finally Louis XV gave him a pension
of 1500 francs a year, and a lodging under
the eaves of the Tuileries; up to this time
Bernis had lived in the house of one of
his relatives, the Baron de Montmorency.
* * * Impatience came to him at last,
and, seeing that he had so much trouble
in making a small fortune, he resolved on
attempting to make a large one; it proved
much easier to do. He began by being
"Bernis, man of society,, of agreeable
conversation and of safe arid brilliant in
tercourse, to which his ambition seemed
limited, was early known to Mme. de
Pompadour: he was in favor with her as
well as with the King, but he had never
as yet obtained anything toward making
his fortune. It was the French Academy
that opened his way to it. /He was elect
ed a member at the close of 1744, that is
to say, when he was 29 years of age. He
succeeded the Abbe Gedoyn and was re
ceived on the same day as the Abbe Gir
ard, the grammarian. * * * In the year3
that followed his reception Bernis figures
more than once at the head of the acad
emy on the solemn occasions when it was
required to appear at Versailles. * * â¢
"He began by making verses to his
'Dieux Penates' (173G), as Gresset did upon
his 'Chartreuse.' These verses of Bernis,
done at 21 years of age, have all Gresset' s
defects; they have also his facility and
his flow, of language..* Â¦*. "This pro
nounced "literary taste, which was, as it
were, -the advertisement of a careless and
worldly life, did Bernis much harm in his
career. Cardinal de Fleury, a friend of
his family, , sent for him and told him that
if he .continued in that course he must
expect nothing so long as he (Cardinal de
Fleury) lived. On which Bernis bowed
humbly an'd made his well-known speech:
'Monsignor, I will wait.'
ence this cramped condition, this contrast
between his tastes and his situation, be
tween all that he saw and did not have.
That rotund and ample figure, that hand
seme rounded face and triple chin which
strike us in the portraits of Bernis as an
old man, came to him rather early in life;
but at first something childlike and deli
cate mingled with them, and always, even
to the last, his people kept its distinction
and elegance; the forehead and eyes were
very fine. . ' ' . : .: ,

the first was to grow more and more into
a burden. upon him; and it was thus that
ennui ended, little by little, by inoculating
him with ambition. â¢ * * Bernis never
became a great directing Minister. Fate
did not give him time to repair his mis
takes or correct his hazardous undertak
ings; but Bernis was always an excellent
Enibassador ; he had insinuation, concili
ation, courtesy; he represented his posi
tion taste and magnificence; he will
always be the model of a French Embas
sador, in Rome, such as he was for twenty
years." . â¢ â¢
His intimate friendship with Mme. de

nal de Bernis one of the most interesting
writings on this period of history.

The ' dinner. . gowns of the summer are
not so very low In the neck.; The tenden
cy Is more toward the higher neck and
the trimmed neck. .The bertha of laco
and flowers, the flounce of embroidered
silk and the rose garland are used : for
bordering the neck. Chiffon' ruffles are
spangled with glass dewdrops and caught
around the rounded neck and one sees

Dinner sleeves ars most Interesting.
They vary' from tho sleeve which Is no
sleeve at all, but only a strapping:, to tho
sleeve which ' Is long and shirred from
top to bottom, with a chiffon outaida and
a taffeta lining.- But such sleeve's are
waning,, a â¢ little In their popularity and
the sleeve that Is liked Is tho elbow
sleeve. . Â¦ .
It is strange how tho elbow sleeve Is
catching, on. "Women looked at It at first
askance, then grew .to admire it ana to
try It. At first -one, feels, awkward in an
elbow sleeve. It is neither one thing
nor the other. Then one becomes accus

over a little silk ruffle, which Is a llttla
deeper than the lace. This Is used to
border the entire neck of a gown, which
Is cut low enough to show the shouldora
of the wearer.
The most becoming of all fancies nsw
holds sway, which Is for thÂ« Insetting oÂ£
lace In a gown. The laca diamond set
Into tho yoke, and repeated at frequent
Intervals, Is as fine and tasteful a thins
as could be devised. The laco yoke, th â¢

There are so many ways of; using the

a favorite one there Is no doubt, but that

Sometimes they come in a V shape,
often square, but more frequently circu
lar. A V-shaped piece of lace is dressed
up ever so much by a pleating of chiffon,
â¢which, though perishable, is not expens
ive and Is always dainty. Mulls, linen
and lawn have been pressed into . service,
and their chief attraction is their wash
abilfty. They are pretty as well. With
plenty of tucks, yards of insertion and
miles of Valenciennes lace they make as
smart a collar as' ever the most fastidious
could; wish for. Let me tell you a Uttla
Â¦secret right here. No 'matter how care
ful one may be, the collar Is bound to be
more or less crushed and rumpled. A

ance is not demanded nor desired.
And they are such handy things, too.
Take, for instance, a plain tailor suit and
dress It up with an ecru Battenberg and
note what a difference it makes. An
ordinary silk waist will spruce: up and
consider itself fit to shine at the theater
if tha,t all-concealing and convenient
piece of neckwear is forthcoming.
And besides these ruffs there are other
accessories that are swell and which look
quite as fit, and, more to the point, do
net cost as much. The laco collar is an
other petted child of Dame Fashion Just
at present. ' ' .
are made in white, with a dash of black,
for this Is essentially a white summer
and the same style will be carried out
more fully next winter. However, there
are people who think a little about dura
bility, and whatever else white chiffon is,
it is not serviceable. Once In a while one
tees them in a pale pink or a delicate
blue, but aB they open the purse strings
generously, one hesitates before getting
a furbelow that cannot be worn with
everything. That Is the beauty of black
and whiteâ no matter what color the
frock is, it never looks amiss. Â¦
One inexperienced in this line of goods
would naturally think that ribbon an
inch and a half wide would not only be
too heavy for the frail material', but that
it would look so as well. But it really
does not The touch of black is- the mak
ing of the ruff, for unless some liberties
are taken all of them would look exactly
alike, barring color.
A swagger one for evening wear la
made of the softest kind of white chiffon.
It is made in four layers and each one
is decidedly separate and distinct. The
lower Is of the chiffon, but heavily edged
with black chiffon ribbon. The next is
a ruffle of the white absolutely plain and'
not very full. Then comes the crowning;
glory. The third ruffle is appliqued witfi
black lace in the most delicate intricate
pattern possible. Here one finds a rose
and there a leaf, while between the two
may be a tiny bud that has strayed away
from home. The strain of black Is in
evidence about the edge again, but It
looks a fit ' topping for the lace design.
Next to the face is a perfect mass of
the plain cl.iffon, and its soft daintiness
helps Dame Nature along In her good
work not a little. The ends are of the'
plaited material and two shirrlnss take
away that fragile look that always ac
companies mousseline. Over the $ last
pleating a plain band of material, heavily
appliqued. Is laid on to further carry out
the lace effect.
Sometimes in the more expensive' ones
âthough heaven knows that none of
them are what one could call cheapâ a
flower fashion is to be found, and right
swagger it is/ too.
Instead of colored frills the material Is
Ehirred time and time again for .the
lower end upper row. The center pieces
must necessarily be ruffles, and Just in
the center of the back is a single flower,
such as a rose, in black lace.
Ey the way, the great majority of ruffs
are straight pieces of veiling -with round
ed ends. By way of variety a plain ruffic
finishes each one. Just where the 'ruche
and tab meet is a, six-end bow of heavy
double-faced * velvet ribbon, and about
half way down the tab, or at about the
wai6t line, another bow breaks the mo
notony.
WOMAN'S delight and man's
abomination haB arrived in full
force. Woman's delight because
it enhances her beauty and af
fords her plenty of sport;
man's abomination because it causes him
embarrassment and annoyance.
What is it. you ask? Why. nothing
more nor less than the pretty, fluffy, de
lurive ruche.
Stand on a corner -where the matinee
girl passes and watch events. Tripping
daintily down the street, clad in all her
finery, she will come. Just as she is in
a bee-line -with you a breath of wind
â¢will catch the filmy thing- and It will suc
cessfully blind you for the moment. A
hurried apology, a snatching back of the
tabs, a fleeting smile, and, the matinee
girl has departed to do exactly the same
thing with exactly the same result, but
with another, quite another, fellow.
But there Is another- kind that affords
more fun by literally catching and holding
a etray chap.
"I've caught him, I've caught him," one
â¢will hear some gushing girl say, and the
remark will bring a 6mile to the face of
even' one. but the real seeing would pro
voke a merry laugh.
Instead of merely blowing in his face
one of the myriads of loops and ends will
twine about a button, or his watch charm,
his handâ anything. In fact, and there it
will stay as though possessed of an evil
spirit. It takes two hands, much fumbling
ani many smiles to loosen, by this time,
the willing victim, and not infrequently
this will-*o-the-wisp thing is responsible
for a quiet flirtation on the side.
One of the most demure appearing is
made of black taffeta with Just a suspi
cion of white. The part that encircles
the ruche is cut like so many ears, and
is fully pleated so that they stand on
ends and spread like a peacock's tail.
All a-bout the edge runs a double frill of
soft black ribbon stitched with white silk.
But the ends are what play the mischief.
"Come a seven, come a 'leven," and you
have it. Seven strands of the ribbon are
run up and down for length, and eleven
pieces are crossed in the opposite, direc
tion, giving the latticed effect- About the
last frill is a full pleating of soft chiffon,
which in turn is finished with the black
and white ribbon.
It Is quiet yet thoroughly smart look-
Ing, but oh, my, the amount of damage
all that lattice work con do. Even the '
fourth man away on the Etreet car Is
not exempt, for it reaches out and out in
quest of game.
One more billowy Is made of white
veiling. A heavy piece, well covered with
dots, for they give stability to the ma
terial. The collar is made of yards and
yards of double ruchlr.gr, packed In as
tightly as they possibly can be. The
ruches are edged with another double
ruche of white ribbon stitched with black
and thÂ« two are put together on whet
one would call the bias. The conse
quence Is an individuality of each row and
the thread of black winds here and there
with remarkable distinctness. The tabs

The musical ritual of the coronation
service announced -to-day shows that'
former settings have been closely" *f ul-
Ibwed with a few notable additions. Chief
of these are the anthems especially com
posed by Sir Frederick Bridge, organist
of "Westminster Abbey; Sir Walter Par
ratt, organist of St. â¢ George's Chapel
RoyaL Windsor, and master of the King's
music and Charles H. Parry, director of
the Royal College of Music. The last
named, **I Was Glad," signalizes the en
trance of the royal party into West
minster Abbey. Midway in the anthem a
break Is made so that the boys of West
minster School may exercise their ancient
privilege of greeting their Majesties' by
shouting "Vivat . Rf glna Alexandra,"
"Vivat Rex Edward!?.
.Among the many ancient customs which
the King has revived is one which makes
these who shook their heads over his es
cape from serious injury on board Sir
Thomas Lipton's Shamrock II May 22,
1S0L almost equaly nervous. His Majesty
has now ordered that an old royal barge,
built for George II, be made seaworthy.
This magnificent relic,, with its elaborate
canopy and high stern, will once more be
floated on Virginia. water, and the King's
"jolly watermen" have heen ordered ', on
duty at Windsor, where the castle lake,
after many years, will soon be the scene
of a water pageant. ~^,y.

uncovered. The correct method, accord
ing to the authority of old prints of pre
vious coronations," is to hold up the cor
onet between the finger and thumb.
Another serious point is how the peer
esses are to carry their costly coronets
when the service commands that they be
One of the greatest present anxieties of
the peeresses is how to keep the coronet
on the head. It cannot bs too firmly fixed
for it has to be quickly taken off and
then replaced in accordance . with the
ritual of the service. â¢
Despite the strict orders issued regard-
Ing the uniformity of the dresses to be
worn by peeresses at the coronation serv
ices, there will be seen the countless va
riations that art and money can devise
without actual disobedience of. the royal
commands. All the dresses must be white,
but many ladies, determined to make their
dresses distinctive ot the occasion and to
preserve them as heirlooms, are having
gowns embroidered with coats of arms,
rational flowers and other devices. These
are being executed in gold and silver, here
and there touched with the forbidden col
ored Bilk in order to bring out the badge
of a. clan or of an ancient heraldic quar
tering. Gold ' embroidery down the sides
cf dresses and on shoulder straps are also
much employed. The Countess of Shrews
bun*, mother of the Earl of polo fame,",
w ill appear, with the exception of hoops,
1n a dress exactly similar to that worn by
the Countess of Eglintoun when George
III was crowned.'
LONDON, June 7.â As the date for the
coronation approaches London is assum
ing a beflagged aspect, the early extent
cf which is to no little 'degree due to the
peace rejoicings. The Indian -and other
foreign Princes, with Oriental costumes,
in the royal carriages, are eights to
Â¦which London is becoming dally accus
tomed.
The feeding of these notabilities almost
drives the court functionaries to despair.
That most orthodox of Hindu poten
tates, the Maharajah of'Jeypoor, who is
Jiving in stately confinement at Lorain
Lodge, has commanded a complete reno
vation of a neighboring slaughter-house,
which is now exclusively devoted to kill
ing animals reculred by the Maharajah
and his enormous suite. All the slaughter-
Ing operations are, naturally, conducted
Hindu butchers, who enshroud the
slaughter-house with amusing secrecy.

ladies constituting this organization are the
wives, daughters, sisters and mothers of
Shriners. who have been initiated in the tem

the case may be. belong. The ceremonials of
the Daughters of Isis are exceptionally ele

void of elements corresponding somewhat to
the humorous features of the Shrine cere
monies.
Each Daughter of Isis is entitled to wear a
white or red fez ornament<Â»d with the regular
Shrine emblem embroidered thereon, and the
name of the temple in which the was Inducted
into ' the mysteries of the order, and to the
credit of these l.-niich ;t may be said that for
loyrlty and devotion to the cause with which
they are identified they set the nobility ot

stely organized into societies kindred to those
Â«>f other fraternal organizations, such as thc-
Kebekahs of the Odd Fellows, but remain un
organized, but not in a condition illustrative
of "a rope of Band." They have means or
ways of making themselves known to eacl>
other -which defy detection. One of the chief
objects cf these feminine Shriners is that or
promoting sociability among themselves and
co-operating with their fathers and husbands
in giving tone and character to the social func

Shriners are distinguished. The "Daughters"
in question having residence in this city, and
consequent affiliation with Islam Temple, have
rendered fcplendid service to the committees or.

There's many a cause for headache.
Men are not often troubled by headaches.
When they are it is generally due to bil-
iousness, or indigestion. But women
have headaches which seem peculiar to
their sex, frequent nervous throbbing â¢
headaches. Does it not seem as if such
headaches peculiar to women must be at
once related to womanly, disease? Wom-
en who suffer with diseases peculiar to
the sex do not realize the drain of vital'
strength and nerve force j they undergo
as a consequence, of disease. It is this
which ; causes the familiar headaches iof

The report plainly hints that officers
can hardly be expected to work so long as
the present system of advancement,
through social influence, is in vogue, or so
long as efficiency has nothing whatever
to do with the selection of officers for de
sirable appointments.
The committee, therefore, recommends
"an honest system of promotion by merit,
following on tes|s, honorably conducted
and honestly reported on."
"So long as mediocrity is permitted to
pass muster," says the committee, "and
signal ability meets with no -substantial
recognition, it is useless to hope for any
valuable results favorable to the regula
tions. Nothing but inducements, in the
shape of reward for good work* either in
peace or war. ran raise the standard of
knowledge through the command ranks."
With the view of diminishing the ex
penses of officers belonging to â¢ cavalry
regiments, the report recommends that
polo tournaments, regimental coaches and
the keeping of hounds be forbidden.
The report condemns the systems of
both Woolwich and Sandhurst, where
education is "far from satisfactory, the
Instructors having no inducement to teach
the cadets; still less to work."
The committee finds that the young of
ficers will not work unless compelled to
do so, that keenness is "out of fashion"
and that "it is not correct form." The
committee finds that many officers do not
possess an elementary education and that
officers ought "at least be able to express
themselves clearly and concisely in their
own language."
LONDON, June 7.â The report of the
Committee on Military Education and
Training, issued to-day, furnishes the
strongest corroboration of the inefficiency

criticism of the existing system. The

HOW TO FIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with your
water and let it stand twenty-four hours;
a sediment or settling indicates an un-
healthy condition of the kidneys; if it
stains the linen it is evidence .of kidney
trouble; too frequent desire to pass it, or
pain in the back is also convincing proof,
that the kidneys and bladder are out of
order. . 5 ',Â« Â¦:
WHAT TO DO.
There Is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, pains in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hoUl
water and scalding pain in passing it, or
bad effects following use of liquor, wine
or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swarrip-Root i3 sooa
realized. It stands the highest 'for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have" the best. Sold by druggists In fifty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottlo of
Swamp-Root and a book that tells more
about it, both sent absolutely free, by
mall. Address Dr. Kilmer & Co., Blng-
hamton, N. Y. When writing mention
that you read this generous offer In the
San Francisco Sunday Call. Don't make
any mistake, but remember the name,
Swamp-Root, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,

"It Is apparent, even to th6 casual ob
server, that art In all its phases is rap
idly developing in this cotirrrry." Beauty; of
surroundings, formerly eon&iderd a-lux
ury, has now become a necessity, and, in
a certain sense a measure of civic pride,
â¢intelligence and refinement. HÂ«nce the
growing importance and manifold ad*
vantages of ornamental horticulture as an
auxiliary to private, public or civic Im
provements Is being dally more recognized.
By stimulating the public taste for flori
culture we do much to magnify the glory
of our State, which Is already accorded
the title of "Land of sunshine, fruit and
flower*." owing to Its unrivaled horti
cultural endowments.
After interesting speeches by President
H. Plath and other members the meeting
listened to instructive remarks by State
Vice President H. H. Lillenthal of the
Society of American Florists and Orna
mental Horticulturists.x He congratulated
the society on the progress indicated by

This unusual honor to an Embassador
causes much comment and Is interpreted
by the Daily Chronicle as paying a
"graceful attention" to the Americans

sure to be much appreciated by them as

yUEENSTOWN. June 7.â The Cunard
line steamer Umbria, from New York
Hay 31, having on board Whitelaw Reid,
the special embassador of the United
Slates to King Edward's coronation, ar
rived here to-day. Mr. Reid, when in
formed of the situation in South Africa,
expressed his pleasure at the fact that
peace had been concluded prior to the
coronation.
While the arrangements have not yet
been completed it is probable that White
law Reid, the special envoy of the United
States to the coronation, and the mem
bers of his etaff and the members of the
United States embassy will constitute a
large proportion of the guests. Doubtless
It will be a brilliant gathering, as Choate' <s

inently fitted for entertainment on a lav

LONDON. June 7.â The dinner which
Joseph' II. Choate, the United States Em
bassador ar.d Mrs. Choate will 'give to
King Edward and Queen Alexandra will
take place Wednesday. June 11. .
The decision of the Navy Department to
refrain from carrying the case further is
based entirely upon a cabled and conse
quently brief report of the action of the
c-'iirt of inquiry and of Admiral Crowiiin
f"nield's disapproval of the recommenda
tions. â¢
There will be no further proceedings in
this case, according to the present Inten
tion of the officials. The grounds on
which Admiral Crowninshield disapproved
the finding, namely, the insufficiency of
evidence, would not. It is believed, give
any cause for offense to the Italian Gov
ernment. The admiral does not find that
the Italian court erred, but he does find
that, situated as the Chicago Is, it is not
I'Ofesible to secure the evidence -which
would justify the assembling of a court
martial.
"Admiral CroWninshield has disap
proved the opinion and recommendation of
the court of inquiry, where it is adverse
to the officers, on the 'ground that it is
not sufficient evidence."- Â¦â¢- :
"The court of inquiry recommends trial
by court-martial of Lieutenant John
Doddridge. U. S. N.; Captain Robert F.
Wynne, U. S. M- C, and -Assistant Sur

day. Inasmuch a8 the proceeds are to be
devoted to the erection of a new church

has been aroused and the indications
point to its proving a huge success.
For some time past the growth of the
parish has been such as to render the
building of a new church imperative in.
order to accommodate the parish wor
shipers. Father McDonald has Â» worked
zealously to raise funds for the purpose
and his efforts have been crowned with
success. He has been aided materially in
his benevolent work by the executive and
building committees of the parish, and It
was decided to devote the proceeds of the
annual picnic to the church building fund.
At a meeting of the committee last night
the various committees reported that tha
arrangements were all but completed and
that through the~ efforts of Father Mc-
Donald the services of Professor McMa

so that all who are fond of jig and reel
dancing may be satisfied.
The picnic boat will leavs the narrow-r
gauge wharf at 9:15 o'clock on Wedtiesday
morning, arriving at the grove at 11:45
o'clock. The cost of tickets for adults is

To deep beneath a tent, to pass the day
In the open air and have nothing else to
dc Is to camp with luxury. "Camp Va
cation" makes this easy- for a^ It is a
hotel under canvas. Regular hotel serv
ice is furnished, but the guests live In
tents. The tents are provided with wooden
floors, are well furnished and are taken
care of by those in charge. The camp is
situated on a bank of the Russian River,
In a redwood grove favored with a de
lightful mingling of sunshine and shade.
A fcplendid table is provided, and the gen
eral cemfort of the guests well looked to.
The camping ground includes 150 acres
while the Russian River affords four
miles for boating and excellent places for
bathing. There is a large stretch of sandy
beach right at the camp. The well known
Leauty of the country about the Russian
River, and the novel but complete plan
for accommodation, make this a most
desirable place for the summer outing.
The rates are $10 per week, and special
rates are made, for families. The camp
Is but a few hours' ride from San Fran
cisco, near Guerneville, on the California
Northwestern Railway, and there are two
trains each way daily. Address "Camp
Vacation," Guerneville, Sonoma County

blunt instrument, knocking: him down.

reason for the assault.
Assaulted bj Three Men.
DENVER, June 7.â Andy Moore, alias
Brassington, who is under arrest in San
Francisco, will be brought to Denver as
soon as a Denver detective can be sent
for him. Moore is charged with having
swindled a number of merchants In both
Denver and Boulder. Moore was at one
time agent for an Eastern safe company.
He sold safes to a number of merchants
in Denver and Boulder and afterward,
losing his position, is charged with hav
ing visited the merchants and obtained
money from them as payment for thÂ»
safes. The firm for whom he was work
ing endeavored to have him arrested, buc
he fled. This was about six weeks ago.
The San Francisco Chief of Police wired
Chief Armstrong this morning asking
that he send a man at once to brinjr
Moore to Denver. An officer will leave to
morrow for San Francisco.
Brassington was insistent in his denial
that he was tne famous : forger bnear,
and yesterday morning it was decided to
examine him by the Bertillon system.
Chief Wlttman, W. H. Levings of tne Bu
reau of Identiiication and George Keiiy.
police photographer, conducted the exami
nation and there was indisputable proof
that Brassington was not Shear. There
was a difference of an inch in height and
other measurements, and certain distinc
tive marks on Shear, according to His de
scription, were lacking on Brassington.
Brassington admits that he is wanted in
Denver for embezzling money belonging
to safe manufacturers in that city, and
will be taken back there to stand his
trial. When he was shown the photo
graph of Shear he was startled by the
wonderful resemblance to himself, and
said he was not surprised that the de
tectives had taken him for the forger.
Chief Wittman, who is a member of the
National Bureau of Identification, ; said
after the examination of Brassington that
the Bertillon system. would in future be
adopted here on all felons, and he pointed
to this case as a striking demonstration
of its efficiency. He had his doubts about
Brassington being Shear from the fact
that from information he had received
from the Pinkerton agency here Shear
should be serving a four-year sentence in
Sing Sing penitentiary, N. Y.
The Bertillon system briefly is to take
two photographs of a criminal, one a
front view and the other a side view, and
to take measurements showing his height,
length of reach, length of trunk, length
and width of head, and length of right
ear, left foot, left middle finger, and left
forearm. All marks on the face and
body are taken, color of the eyes and
hair, formation and length of nose and
other features.
.The resemblance between Brassington
and a photograph of Shear sent by Super
intendent Pierce of Boston is most smit
ing in every particular, even to the wear
ing of glasses and a photograph wruch
Btassington had in his possession would
without hesitation be accepted as that or
Shear.
The Bertillon system of Â¦ identifying
criminals, which was introduced here by
Chsef Wittman lor the first time yeste -
day in the case of H. Brassington, who
was arrested Friday night by Detectives
McMahon, Wren and Dlnan, demonstrate
ed its etticacy. Brassington, who was ar
rested at the reauest of -the Denver
authorities on a charge of embezzlement,
was also suspected of being Leroy G.
Shear, a noted criminal with many
aliases, who. is wanted in Boston on a
charge of forgery. ...
Brassington Wanted in Den
ver to Answer Em
bfzzlement Charge.
Bertillon Rule Proves a
a Mistake Was
Made.

WHO WILL APPEAR AT THE
ALCAZAR MONDAY NIGHT.
FLORENCE ROBERTS is an ex
tremely buEy woman these days.
What with* rehearsals, dressmakers
and planning new productions fcr
her forthcoming season at the Al
cazar every minute of her time is taken
up.
Miss Roberts is in Jove with her profes-
Elon. She is a deep student and an Inde
fatigable worker. The thoroughness of
fcer productions is evidence of the care
and judgment she uses. Despite the fact
that she has all the trying duties that fall
to the lot of a successful artist, Miss
Roberts Is In splendid health. She looks
forward with pleasure to to-morrow
eight, when she will greet the audience
that attends the opening of her fifth sea
eon In San Francisco.
Miss Roberts has surrounded herself
with all the evidence of refinement. Her
apartments a^e filled with ornaments she
has gathered In her travels, and volumes
cf old plays and books of the present day
fill the bookcases. It is here ehe spends
her hours in studying the roles that have
won. her fame In her profession.
Five years ago Miss Roberts opened at
the Alcazar with her husband, Louis Mor
rison, but for four seasons she has starred
alone, with White Whlttlesey as leading
man.
On Monday night Miss Roberts opens
fa "Zaza," a play that David Belasco
wrote for Mrs. Leslie Carter. Compari
sons are odlons, but, nevertheless, those
who attend the performance given by
Miss Roberts and her company will surely
judge her acting by the artistic work of
the creator of the role.
" 'Zaza,' " said Miss Roberts enthusi
astically, "is a wonderful play. The lead
ing role gives one the opportunity to ex
press even" human emotion. It is a play
A recent report shows that 2599 Chris
tians were murdered In 1S01 by the Turks
In only sixty-one cases were the murder-'
ers punished, and .-then- with ; not more
than four years' imprisonment.' ;C-
that is very broad, and if Interpreted too
closely is apt to shock the refined sensi
bilities of your audience. I have found
that theater-goers of San Francisco are
not in favor of plays that areâ what shall
we sayâ too broad. Had I played
as it was produced in New York it could
never have gone nine weeks in this city.
If I remember rightly, a play called "The
Turtle" was produced at a local play
house just one night and was cried down,
and yet the very same production- enjoyed
a two years* run in New York.
"My interpretation of 'Zaza' is some
what different from that of Mrs. Carter.
Of course we are of different tempera
ments. My presentation of the role is not
as broad. Those who have seen our pro
duction are very much pleased, and I
trust theater-goers of this city will take
the same view.
" 'Zaza' Is a most difficult role to play.
The wear and tear on my gowns, voice
and physique have been very great. I am
now having the third set of gowns made
for the part. I have regained my voice
and my general health is improved."
Miss Roberts is very much in love with
San Francisco. She thinks it a wonder
ful city and its people pleasure loving.
She is surprised that a city of its size
can support so many theaters and even
more surprised that they patronize the
opera throughout the year. She says no
other city in the Union compares with
San Francisco in the matter of taste for
the higher class of productions.
"What city would patronize Shakes
pearean plays?" she said. "In all the East
the old comedies do not draw at all. Dur
ing my last season 'The Taming of the
Shrew,' 'Romeo and Juliet* and 'The
School for Scandal' were my greatest
successes. This year I intend producing
'As You Like It.' Heretofore I have re
frained from playing Rosalind because of
my size, but I intend to throw height to
the winds and essay the role. Mr. Whlt
tlesey and I are familiar with the play
and take to the legitimate with ease be
cause of the experience we gained In
plays of that kind while with Mr. Morri
son, v' Â¦â¢ ;
"Among the new plays I Intend appear
ing In this season is one by Franklin
Fyles, critic on the New 1 York Sun and
collaborator with David Belasco in 'The
Girl I Left Behind Me.' It is called
'Druse Wayne' and is a problem play.
Another play I will appear In. is from
the pen of Steele Mackaye. It has not
been named as yet. I also intend produc
ing 'Miss Pendragon," one of the best
things that Miss Charlotte Thompson has
done. It was to have been a sequel to
â¢Silver Mounted Harness,' but we decided
against the plan."
Miss Roberts expresses regret that Mr.
Morrison would not be here. She said
this will be the first time he has been
absent from the city during her season. '
In White Whlttlesey Miss Roberts has a
leading man of ability. He not only can
act, but he has magnetism. Coupled with
these requisites Mr. Whlttlesey has a
stage presence. He Is tall and eymmetri
cally built. His voice is well modulated
and he delivers his Jines with grace and
perfect enunciation. Mr. Whittlesey has
acted as leading man for Miss Roberts for
many years. He has played roles of every
character and has won the approval of
the severest critics. He is very popular
with the theater-goers of this city and
curely will be accorded a warm welcome
to-night when he makes his ' appearance
on the Alcazar stage. He plays the- part
cf Bernard Dufrene.
Can it be true that the practice of the law in San Francisco is v so spectacular that it is
merely a preparation for a theatrical career?. .
If it be true that Edward VII is responsible for the liberal terms given the Boers, and for
the refusal to visit upon them the least humiliation, then .his reign begins with evidence' of states
manship that. promises well for his empire, and the:Boer cheers for their new King are justified "
The opposition to; Mr. Morgan's Atlantic steamship trust seems to fear that he may be able
to fence in that ocean, treat it as a mare clausum, and punish all intruders for trespass.
Miss Helen Gould is a _ credit to her country. She never appears in public except to do
something worthy, or receive credit that she has well earned. The University of New York has
just made her a Master of Letters, while the students approved by singing "For She's a Tolly
It will be well for English newspapers to omit talk about the '"surrender of Boer com
mandoes." The Boers do not surrender. They have made a treaty and are keeping it. To lay
down their arms is nornore a surrender to the British than like action by Kitchener's forces is a
surrender to De' Wet.
., Central America must be unstable territory. With Senator Hanna proving that Nicaragua
and Costa Rica are red hot with lava and ashes, and Senator Morgan countering with evidence
that Colombia is subject to earthquakes that make the land look like breakers on the Columbia
River bar, and to riots that equal those in the. Austrian Parliament, it looks as if the world's com
merce will have to cross the isthmus in flying machines.
A MAN in Berkeley killed a friend and neighbor who entered his house to protect a daugh
ter against his abuse. On his trial the plea of^nsanity, due to alcoholism, was entered,
and the jury found him insane and therefore " irresponsible at the moment of the homicide!
We believe the plea of temporary insanity at the moment of a homicide was first
made successfully on the trial of Daniel E. Sickles for the killing of Key. Since then that plea
has become common, but its validity has consisted in the cause of the temporary aberration being
beyond the control of the person affected. In this view it will be seen that the plea of the Berke
ley man differed from any. that had preceded it. His temporary insanity was ascribed to the use
of alcohol, but that use was voluntary. It had no origin exterior to himself and over which he
had no control. During his confinement in jail he was not permitted to use liquor, and this forced
abstention has continued during his confinement in the asylum for the insane. He now declares
himself of sound mind and proposes to ask the courts to sethim free' Is not his case one of vol
untary insanity? If, on being freed from the asylum, he again take to drink, being sane at the
time he does so/ and as a result 1 he again become insane and kill some one else, will it not
be clearly a case of voluntary insanity? : ; _ . '-'I \ .
If so, if he deliberately, while sane, indulge, in that which will make him insane, and if
while insane he commit a crime, is it just to society to acquit him on the plea of insanity?' At the
timeMie begins the indulgence that leads to insanity and crime, being sahe/he is morally respon
sible. Then why is he not morally and legally, responsible. for all that follows?
Surely the question raised is one of great importance and should .engage the attention of
courts and of lawyers skilled in medical jurisprudence, as well as of the expert alienists.

CHARMING YOUNG , BRIDE

GAGEMENT IS ANNOUNCED.
NO GIRL ever, received more good
wishes than has Miss Pearl Land
ers sir.ee her engagement to Harry
Scott was announced a few days
ago. Loads of dainty presents and
many devoted girl friends await her re
turn to the city. Meanwhile, many . love
thoughts" travel down to the new bride
elect at Burlingame, where she is the
guest of Mrs. Henry T. Scott, mother of
her nance. Miss Lander3 would have re
turned ere this but for a sprained liga
ment which rendered it advisable to re
main In the country until she could get
about comfortably.
No debutante of last winter was more
beloved than Pearl Landers. So constant
ly was she entertained that her popular
ity became a topic for dawlng-rooms and
the best conclusion reached was that her
gentle, loving personality and sympathet
ic thoughtf r .lness for others won her best
friends.
Nearly every debutante finds the ardor
of her coming-out season dampened by
cold blankets of criticism, and, with all
eyes upon her, becomes too" nervous to
have a genuinely â¢ good time and looks
back longingly to the season past when
she went informally, to parties and danced
like mad. having "the tln.e of her life."
But Miss Landers has had nothing to re
gret from the first. Then to make things
more interesting Prince Charming appears
and life takes on a roseate hue.
As Miss Landers is still in her teens and
the groom effect but 22, It will be some
time before wedding bells are sounded.

ing lady with John Drew. If Miss Angltn
is to be as eagerly sought after as usual
by those of the Burllngame set who en-
Joy clever people, she will have little timÂ«i
to spare. I believe the Casserlys arc
among her warmest friends. Miss Anglin
has arranged to tuck herself- away in &
flat while here. This is the way she lives
when in New York. Edith Huntlngton
called upon her while Bast and returned
with a glowing description of her apart
ments, in fact pronouncing them among
the most artistic sbÂ« ever saw.
This reminds us that Miss Huntlngton
is very artistic herself. She adds a bow.
collar or belt to her toilette 'with a
Frenchy air more effective than a gowr.
raaker's. Miss Huntington's "den," too,
is strikingly artistic. There is a quiet
elegance about everything in the room
and many original touches. While In New
York City Miss Huntington picked up a
number of the oddest flat-looking lan
terns, which shed soft red and green
lights In the "den."

' .X X J HENthe revelations concerning the management of San Quentin were made, it was
\ l\ I at' once obvious that a duty was imposed upon the Prison Directors.
\f x\f .While there was some appearance of flinching on the part of that body, its
" conclusion apparently was reached and armounced by the president, Mr. Fitzgerald,
to the effect that an absent member would : etiirn ' on the 6th instant, and then the board would
proceed with -an investigation. We noted then the, use that accused, officers might make of this
delay, but accepted it as inevitable, and the people waited for the action of the Directors. We are
not informed whether the absent Director returned or not , but there is 'no sign of any preparation
for action. Meantime the Governor of the State has entered upon a private inquiry, behind closed
doors at the prison. / :
The public records which belong in the State offices at Sacramento, and' from which they
are not to be removed except by the order of a court, have been removed'aid taken to the prison
for the use of the Governor in his private inquiry, and citizens of the State, who have the right of
access to those records in the place of their legal custody, find that right" suspended and therefore
denied. If the Governor have the right to remove one record from one office, he has the right to
remove all recqrds from all offices; and if he can take, one record to any place that suits him, he
can take them all â to Los Angeles/ for; instance. If he can so remove one record and hold it during
his pleasure, he can remove and keep; all records, which implies his power to remove the capital
for executive purposes to any place that he- mayv choose. So much for the method chosen -by the
Governor te facilitate his private inquiry into these irregularities.
That inquiry is purely, ex parte. The people, and their representatives are denied access to
it, and have-no part in it. The Prison Directors are the representatives of the people in prison
management, and are responsible to the people.- The Directors are not present at the Governor's
' secret inquiry, and have no information concerning it.
What will be their position if the^Gcvernbr report that the management is virgin and un
stained? He has announced that the revelations, which he is investigating privately, affect him
: in his official and personal character sb seriously that he proposes to resort to the civil and crim
inal law to punish those who' are responsible for" them. Under these circumstances is he the
proper_person to make such an ex' parte inquiry, and report upon a case which he makes his own?
'The Governor is human, and he is also Governor. 'Would it not occur to any other^man in his
place that a vindicatory report upon himself, rendered by himself, after an ex parte investigation
of himself by himself,' will not vindicate him? The people see this distinctly. They see also the
peculiar position in which this proceeding places the Prison Directors, and they see also that the
Governor's strange action^ whether so intended by him or not, has the direct effect of preventing
a public investigation, or of so limiting it as to make it worthless.
The Governor's organs charge with great freedom, vituperation and recklessness that The
Call has an entirely personal mqtive in making these revelations. This charge has no foundation.
â¢ We have no more personal motive than we had in exposing the acts of the ring which was manip
ulating the jute bag business of the prison a few years ago. That manipulation was an abuse of
which the farmers of the State were the victims. We proved our case, and it is not forgotten that a
manipulator in the interest of that ring, who did the work inside the prison, finally took flight and
his place of refuge has not been disclosed to' this day. The matter had been proven already, and
his flight was simply a confession. Our motive* then was not personal, nor is it now. If the reve
lations affect the Governor so seriously as he declares they do in his signed statement in the Ex
aminer, thai is his misfortune, but not our fault. * . â¢
The people want the prison management kept straight, and a newspaper neglects its duty if
it conceal;, crookedness of which it has knowledge. We believe the evidence-which we have secured
and published, and other evidence ;in/bur /possession which awaits publication. The matters which
the Governor is investigating 1 behind the door have been submitted by us to public judgment. His
very investigation is an admission of. the importance which he concedes to them. It would be a far
more becoming act- on Ulis part to/let others investigate publicly, so that the people may know
what is done. We are. not afraid of the people. /Why. should he be?
It is interesting to observe~that while his organs charge us with a personal motive, he and
they make no other reply in an entirely public matter than apersonal attack upon those who have
made it public. : ..
If there are any men in the State whom the Governor can trust and who will have the con
fidence of the people, we venture to" advise that he leave to them an investigation and report, after
an inquiry that is neither secret, nor ex parte, and that does not require a removal of public rec
ords from the place of their legal deposit and custody. The Governor has publicly announced
that he is the accused party, therefore in an investigation his pleading puts himself on trial, and in
such trial he has constituted himself judge, jury, prosecutor, attorney for the defense, and witness.
If any think that such a trial will settle anything, then who so thinks, thinks vainly.

will be examined to-day as to her sanity.
On Friday night shÂ© was received at tho
Harbor Hospital and It was supposed
that she had taken poison. Further in

Special Policeman Joseph Glllen became
involved in a quarrel on Pacific street
early yesterday morning with a character
known as "Spot." They came to blows
and "Spot" gave the officer a thrashing.
After the affray Sergeant Christensen and
Policeman Holmes came upon the scene
of the encounter, whereupon oillen re
quested them to arrest "Spot." They re
fused, however, to do so, and told Gillen
to make the arrest himself, but he re
fused on the ground that he was afraid
to tackle the man again, and consequently
he lot him go. Christensen has madÂ© a
report of the affair to Captain Birdsall,
charging Gfllen with drunkenness while

the chapter and twice therr number could
have been disposed of to advantage. The
exercises took place at the Bella Vista,
which was decorated in honor of th.e oc
casion, and booklets were freely distrib

laws of the chapter, demonstrating tho
memorial and charitable work being ac
complished. A reception committee of tiie
chapter received the guests in old South

pleasure and enjoyment pervaded a mind
of a guest. Rev. R. C. Foute. chaplain
of the chapter, used a gavel madÂ« from

of Ei Dorado County, State Mineralogist
Anbury calls attention to several Interest
ing facts, lie first mentions that here "it
was that gold was first discovered in Cali

(be course of the review the statement is
made that when the channels of this
county are opened upon a scale . commen-.
feurcte to their size and value they wilt
sti-r.d second to none in the production of
gold. The slate quarries of El Dorado
County are the only ones within reach of
railroad transportation in the State.
There are splendid possibilities for the de
velopment of cheap and efficient motive
powf r. The county has numerous de
posits of high grade copper ore. The de
posits of limestone are extensive and
valuable and marble is also found. As- i
bestos is found in several places. A part
of the review made by the State Mineralo
gist is as follows:
through Grizzly Flat, has many mines that
have been and are now producers. The "West
Belt" also contains . many mines that have
been successfully worked, and others are now
being auspiciously developed.
The ancient channel gravel systems "of El
Dorado County are very extensive, consisting
of at least three burled lava-capped channels
extending practically across the county In a
northerly and southerly direction. El Dorado
County is not a place where wealth and treas
ure can be obtained without effort, but It does
offer as fine opportunities as any mountain sec
tion in California for - unremitting industry,
backed by capital, to earn a fitting reward. â¢ In
brief, the. rich and varied resources of- this
county offer unusual inducements to enterprise
and capital, and in addition to the regular re
turns upon the investment, there should be an
increase of -value consequent upon development.
In connection, with the register. of El

deposit in the limits of the county, also

SEAB^CHHSTG TOE PLACERS. =
Not since the early days of placer min
ing 1 In California, so says the Los Angeles
Times, has there been such an active
search for placer mining: ground as there
Is now. The Times says:
"tte commonly accepted belief has been ftjat
it -would be only a waste of time to try and
get sold out of the gravel and earth by the
dry washing process, so that where water for
sluicing was not obtainable the average mining
man has been content to admit the existence
of gold in dry placer regions, but has utterly
refused, to make any effort to work the gravel
or earth by the dry process. 'But, 'as in the case
of quartz mining and hydraulic mining,- so also
in placer mining, have improved methods been
found, and difficulties hitherto looked upon as
Insurmountable are being overcome, with the
result, as stated, that placer ground Is now in
good demand all over the Pacific Coast. At the
placers discovered some, three months ago near
Dos Cabezas, in Cochise County; Ariz., a dry
washing plant, known as the Feltner (New
York) process Is going to be- erected. The ma
chine Is In the nature of an experiment, but
It will be tried at Dos Cabezas on a large ecale,
and should its mechanism bo capable of demon
strating Its ability to extract the fine gold from
the earth. It will be the means of- converting
a very large area of placer ground Into valu
able property, and what it may be able to do

Jury in O'Hare Will
Case Decides in'
Their Favor.
The sisters of the late Joseph O'Hare,
whose last will and testament was con
tested in Judge Coffey's court, will come
into their own. ,A Jury last night ren
dered a verdict sustaining decedent's .will
of 1901, in which they were the sole lega
tees. Deceased left two wills.- One was
made . on May 28, 1894, and the other ok
October 24, 1901. In the former will he
left his property, valued at $45,000, as fol
lows: ;
To-W. F. Burbank of Oakland, $2000; to
his sisters, Mrs. Margaret Gowdey and
Mrs. C. M. Lally, $500 each; and the resi
due of the estate to Mrs. Mary Jane Rog
ers, another Â¦ sister. In the will of last
year he leaves his property to his three
sisters, share and share alike.
The beneficiaries under the first will at
tempted to have the last will set aside.
The case has been on trial before Judge
Coffey for the last two weeks. . Yesterday
afternoon the Jury was charged and re
tired to. deliberate on a verdict. i
â¢ Joseph O'Hare came here from New
York and resided for a time with the fam
ily of Thomas Jacques. Several years ago
Mrs. Lavenia Lally, his niece, came here
from New York and commenced legal pro
ceedings against the Jacques family to re
cover O'Hare's property, which she
claimed had been obtained â¢ by Â¦ the Jac
ques family from her uncle while he was
of unsound mind and under their influ
ence. She also had the Jacques family
"prosecuted on * a charge of | kidnaping
O'Hare. The fight for the property lasted
several months, and ended in Thomas
Jacques paying to Mrs. Margaret Gowdey,
who ln the meantime had been appointed
O'Hare's guardian, the sum of $12,500 in
settlement of the .litigation. .,
O'Hare was declared , an Incompetent
and Mrs. Gowdey assumed control of his
estate and person,* finally taking, him to
New York for medical Â¦ treatment. He
died two days after, reaching Â¦ New. York.
The will of 1901 was offered for probate
in New York, ' but it was contested i by

ground that when It was executed, O'Hare

HITCHCOCK MILITARY ACADEMY,
A trial of the above selection of food
for ten days will prove to any one that
health and vigror, an active mind and a
keen enjoyment of the pleasures of sum-
mer will take the place of poor digestion,
â¢ dull brain and that heavy, draggy feel-
lr.g- caui.td by Improper food during the
hot weather.
A booklet of excellent recipes is found
in each package of Grape-Nuts from
which many easy and delicious warm
weather dishes can be made for luncheon
and supper that are not only nutritious,
but pleasing to the palate.
Grape-Nuts come to you from the gro-
cer ready to serve, having been fully
cooked at the factory by food experts,
&r.d this saving in time and exertion is
appreciated by the housewife as well as
the economy, for being a concentrated
food, four teaspoonfuls Is sufficient for
the cereal part of a meal for one person
and costs only one cent.
.'Particularly is this true at the present
eeaeon of the year, when meat and other
f/atty foods increase the internal heat of
the body and make the summer day still
more disagreeable.
The best mornlnc foundation is Grape-
ICuts and cream, a little fruit, a cup of
Postum Ft>od Coffee and possibly a cou-
lile of eggs prepared to suit the tasteâ
this breakfast is sufficient to satisfy the
hardest worker, either of brain or muscle,
until the noonday meal.
.Never eal heavy carbonaceous foods for
the morning meal, for these foods should
follow and not precede hard work.

. Dear Sir â Since purchasing an Oxygenor
King, nearly one year and a half ago, we havo
had no occasion- to Â¦ resort to medicines. We
have used the Oxygenor for - la grippe, gore
tlroat, colds, debilitated blood, . fevers, croup,
inflammation of the bladder, diarrhoea and
constipation. In all of these cases the effect
was prompt and gratifying. : ' .
Last spring I used it. on one of my members
whom , the doctors declared to be beyond re-
covery from pneumonia. .'The effect was Im-
mediate. His was reduced -four
degrees in. twelve hours, and he started on the
toad to .- recovery. One' lady who purchased
one i declared, af ter . the : first course of treat-
ment, that ; ehe . was benefited far more than
by a previous expenditure of $125.00, includ-"
jng a surgical operation. ; This was months ago
and she Is still enthusiastic. Â¦ . . â¢; .
-A mart whose- wife has. been, ap Invalid for
years said- After tliree courses of. treatment:
"She- is stronger to-day - than I have ever
known : her. to be." Another lady, subject i to
nervous headaches, has repeatedly cured them
in a. few â¢ moments with'; tha .Oxygenor. The
names- of these ; people can be secured by ad-
dressing nus at any time.- .Truly, yours.

LOS ANGELES, June 7.â Los Angeles
broke the hoodoo to-day in a most decis

constituted a handicap that Lohman's

water on the track, while the field was a
miniature lake. Under such conditions
fast work was out of the question. The

T.. I. Fitzpatrick, bond and. warrant
clerk; Louis H. Ward/ assistant bond and
warrant clerk; Police Officer W. H. Lev
ings, who took Lyons' statement after his
arrest, and'A. B. Mahony, County Clerk,
were examined, but their testimony con
tained nothing that has not already been
made public.
Charles B. Perkins, deputy in the Treas
urer's office, told about Lyons presenting
the order. - He said that it was perfectly
regular for a party other than the one
who had deposited the bail to draw the
anoney down. He said that in cashing the
order Lyons acted in his usual manner,
and Hid not have the. least appearance of
doing anything wrong.
Although the hearing of the case con
sumed the entire day in Judge Cabaniss'
court -and all the witnesses who could
possibly throw any light on the commis
sion of the fraud were examined, nothing
new was developed. Barrett devoted his
efforts while cross-examining the wit
nesses to show that no conspiracy to de
fraud existed between Lyons and Con
way, that everything criminal in the
withdrawal of the money rested on Con
way's shoulders and that the criminal act
consisted in his tricking Judge Mogan
into signing the spurious order.
J. M. Evans, who put up Jessie Hol
land's bail money, testified as to the man
ner in which he discovered that the
money had been drawn from the treasury
without his knowledge or consent. - He
also told of his having subsequently re
ceived $250 from Conway in place of the
money which had been withdrawn.
Judge E. P. Mogan gave a detailed ac
count of the mode of procedure in with
drawing exonerated bail money from the
treasury. He said that he did not know
of any connection that Lyons had with
the withdrawal of the Jessie Holland bail
money, and that Lyons had most certain
ly done nothing to induce the court to
affix its signature to the fraudulent order.
Assistant District Attorney Hanley ar
gued against the motion, and the court
took it under advisement until 10 o'clock
Monday morning.
The preliminary hearing will be finished
when â¢ the Judge announces his decision
regarding the motion of dismissal, as At
torney Barrett stated that he would make
no defense.
Barrett said that the presentation of
the order for the withdrawal of the bajj'
money by Lyons for the accommodation
of Conway was merely done as an act of
friendship and might have been done un
der similar circumstances by any one, not
excepting the court or the District Attor
ney. â¢ .
The preliminary hearing of Fred Con
way and Robert E. Lyons on the charge
oÂ£ having fraudulently drawn down $250,
the bail money deposited for the appear
ance of Jessie Holland, was commenced
yesterday morning before Judge Cabaniss.
But one of the defendants was present,
as Conway has not yet been located by
the police. The prosecution made' rapid
headway. In presenting . the case against
Lyons, and before adjournment was taken
iu the afternoon all the ' evidence had
been ' submitted. When -the prosecution
had completed its case Attorney John
Barrett moved for a dismissal of the case
against Lyons on the ground that not a
single particle of evidence had been pro
duced to show that he had done anything
criminal. ..

SAN FRANCISCO.
Doyle carried off all the honors in sight
and would probably have had some more
had there been a chance. He cut off a
triple from Nordyke's bat and took two
more hard chances in left. He was there
â¢with two doubles and a single at precisely
the correct moment San Francisco drops
into third place again by virtue of Los
Angeles' victory over Oakland In the
south. The score:
The Ponies were buffaloed by Thomas
at all stages of the strife. In the seventh
a single by Nordyke and Hulen's error
put a Ponv to the good. Holly's two
cushion swipe and another misplay by
Hulea finished up the run-getting for the
day.
The struggle was a pitchers' battle be
tween Meredith and Thomas up to the
seventh spasm. Then the Senators took
a brace and began to swat the leather to
the four corners of the lot. Four hits,
including a double by Graham and errois
by Delmas and Shugart, were instrumen
tal In putting a quartet of the unfortun
ates on the last side of the welcome rub
ber amid great ado from the stands and
bleachers. Two more singles and a sacri
fice earned another in the final round.
The players were probably, the most
surprised individuals In the lot. After
Delmas flew out to Sheehan in the ninth
with two on the bags and two gone to the
pities the members of the Senatorial con
tingent stretched to their full length on
the diamond and remained out for about
two minutes. It was a clever stunt,
amusing the fans immensely.
Many startling and unlooked-for events
often come to pass In this city. Mike
Fisher's nine of ball tossers won the
money and gave the fans a severe shak
ing up yesterday by actually copping out
the game from the Ponies. The score was
5 to 2.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON,: June 7â William S. Champ,
secretary' of the Baldwin-Ziegler expedi
tion, is awaiting the arrival of several
members of his party before starting on
his journey to search for Evelyn B. Bald
Â¦w in, who is now* in the polar regions.
"While personally I feel the greatest
confidence that Baldwin succeeded in his
last " attempt to discover the pole," said
Champ to-day, "I realize, however, that
there is a great possibility of the con
trary. Consequently, I do not feel like
saying much until we can show that
something has actually been accom
plished.
"1 expect to leave Liondon. next Frlday
for Tromso. The Fritjof, auxiliary whale
vessel, which accompanied the steamer
America, which is now in the polar re
gions, t6 Franz Josef Land, is just out
of drydock. -
"We shall leave Tromso in July. I shall
first endeavor to find the America, which
I think has been wintering in latitude 82
degrees. Then we shall try to pick up
Baldwin and the rest of his party. It is
by no means certain that Baldwin will be
ready to return, but if all goes as I think
it will I shall be back in London between
October 1 and 15. There will be twenty
three in my party, most of them Ameri
cans. We shall take surgeons and medi
cines as well as supplies, as it is likely
the winter in the Arctic regions may have
left its effects on the members of Bald
win's party."

never intended that poisons of an irritating or acid
character should be eliminated through the skin, the Liver and Kidneys being their natural

poisons are absorbed into the blood and find their way to the surface of the body through the
pores and glands of the skin, producing intense itching and burning, inflammation and
swelling, and eruptions of every conceivable size, shape and character.
Skin Diseases differ greatly in their general characteristics and degrees of intensity.
Red and angry looking spots break out upon some part of the .body with a mass of small
pustules or blisters, from which is discharged a clear or straw colored fluid, which- dries and
flakes off in bran-like particles and scales, or forms into hard and painful sores and scabs.

"THere are two reasons why we are selling more high-

reason is that our patterns are mostly exclusive and very

Thomas E. Curran acted as secretary.
Chairman Sims opened the meeting with
the announcement that Its purpose was to
issue the call for holding tnc next Demo
cratic convention n.1 a time and place to
be selected by the committee.
R. M. Fitzgerald, chairman of the sub
committee having in charge the prepara

read bv Secrctarv Curran. This was the
call published in this paper yesterday
morning. It provides for G>6 delegates in
stead of C2l', the latter being the number
heretofore.
Seth Wellington of Colusa said that
taany of the counties had already chosen
ihoir delegates to the convention, but un-
Oer the call their status was in doubt.
This Opened a long discussion, in which
Fitzgtrald expressed the conviction that
all eewjities having chosen their delegates
must uo the work ovor again in order that
the law might be fully complied with. It
was agreed that the laiv requiring the

The allowance of ons delegate at large
for each county gave rise to considerable
cUscussion. Senator Sims and ft. M. Fitz

relating to the operation of the provision.
This Question was a stunner: "What
would happen, for example. If a cicy

tory should elect a delegate at large, and
xlie county convention, composed of dele
gates outside of the city, should choose
another delegate at large?" No one was

riU AND THEIR
Scientific Treatment
' O â âO
O. C. JOSLEN, M.D.
The Leading Specialist
o â o
All my methods of UeaUiig men's dis-
eases are ba_ed upon absolutely scierUt-
nc principles. They are methods orls-
inal with myself. Like methods ara
employed by no other physician, nor
does any other physician or specialist
duplicate the results I obtain by their
use. Perfect results are conclusive
proof of ecientilic accuracy. I have
treated men only for fifteen years, and
my ability to effect thorough and ab-
solutely permanent cures has won me
the largest practice of Its kind ln tho
entire West.
I am always will-
ing to wait for my
fee until cure is
effected.
"Weakness"
That condition commonly known as
"weakness" ft in reality oue of the
most 'simple of men's ailments, and oni
that yields promptly and completely to
correct treatment. Fur generations
paet physicians have been handing
down a moss-grown theory to the ef-
fect that prematureness. loss of power,
etc. ere due to nervous derangement,
brought on through . excesses, and to
this day the treatment commonly em-
ployed by moet physicians and special-
ists is & nerve stimulating one that ex-
cites the organs to temporary activity,
but which in "the er'l cannot fall to
aggravate the real disorder. "Weak-
ness" is nothing more than a symptom
resulting from a tender, swollen anÂ«l
inflamed condition of the prostate
Eland. This proetatic disorder is most
frequently due, to early dissipation or
to injury caused by some ; contracted
disease. My treatment la a local one
entirely, no stimulants or tonics bein?
employed, and is in every instance
promptly effective in restoring the pros-
tate gland to its normal state. As this
is accomplished full and complete
strength and vigor return. Such a cure
is absolute and permanent, and by no
other method can a Uke cure bt ef-
fected.
Contracted Disorders
- Every case of contracted disorders I
treat Is thoroughly cured. My patients
have no relapses. When I pronounce a
case cured there is not a particle of in-
foctlon or inflammation remaining, and
there is not the slightest danger Uiat
the disease will return in its original
form or work it6 way into the general
system. No contracted disorder is so
trivial as to warrant uncertain methods '
of treatment, and I especially solicit
those cases that other doctors have
been unable to cure.
Varicocclc
This tr.cst prevalent of all diseases of
men is also the most neglected, either
through dread of the harsh methods of
treatment commonly employed, or'
through ignorance of the grave dangers
that accompany the disease. Aa vari-
cocele interferes direcUy with, the cir-
culation â¢ ami process of waste and reÂ»'
pair throughout the organs, the ne-
cossity of. a prompt anU thorough cure
cannot be" too forcibly emphasized. I
cure varicocele in one week by an ab-
solutely pa!n!css process. My cures
are thorough and ibsolutely perma-
nent and are accomplished without th*
usa of knife, ligature or caustic

The twQ men directly concerned wera
great friends. Lapique claimed
to have Maysounave's note for $1000. The
last named denied this, and finally swore
to a warrant for Lapique's arrest for for
gery. â¢Â¦ When 'the matter, was brought to
trial the principal , evidence against the
accused was the testimony of , a hand
writing expert, who stated that the sig
nature to the alleged note was a tracing
ofthat of another document, which was
an exhibit in the "case. . Evidence vfas in
troduced by the defense to prove- that the
exhibit was not In existence . until the
note had been: presented for"payment. The
testimony was very conflicting, in -many
important particulars, but the -jury re
turned a verdict of guilty. - . .
After . the trial Charles Smyth" stated
that^Maysounave had informed him that
he had made out the note at the request
of Louise Lagarde, but that as he bad
never received any payment from her ha
did not intend to lose the $1000. The Judge
refused to 'grant a new trial on this show
ing and the casev was appealed. - . Â¦ - .'- i
.: ;The:- Supreme Court holds that the case
against Lapique was a very weak one to
start . with and the court's Â¦ rulings .vwere
very. prejudicial to the defense throughout
the trial. It is-also held -that a new. trial
should have been allowed when 'Smyth's
knowledge of the affair became known.
. John Lapique, . who. was convicted of the
forgery of the name of Philip Maysou
nave ; to a promissory, note several years
ago, was granted' a new trial by the Su
preme Court yesterday. The ground- for
reversal- of .the lower court's judgment
is insufficiency, of evidence and erroneous
rulings. -The. former trial .was attended
with, a great deal of interest, as all of th3
principals were prominent members of the
local French colony, and many persons of
high standing were drawn into the case
as witnesses.

THIS Is the story of the parole of Mali \oon. Mah Noon is a highbinder,
a gnn and hatcbet man and was also a cnlly aMd pander of , the alleys
In. Chinatown. He shot another Chinese murderously and fought, five
police officers, who fell upon him while the smoking pistol was in his
hand. Mali Noon holds the highbinder record. He Is the; only one
that ever fought the poMcc. In resisting arrest he shot Officer. Tracy,
and his indictment for that crime still hangs over him and. he maybe.
convicted under It when he serves the sentence imposed upon him for
shooting â¢ the Chinese, who lingered many months and died of his wounds.
a *Â» Aoonwas tried for that crime, was convicted r.nd ' sentenced "to- fourteen
years In San Quentin. When he was safe behind the bars the police breathed
easier, for in the long list of highbinders who have made' Chinatown bloody "in"
*he wars of the Tongs Mah Noon was the most vicious r.nd desperate.
But Mah Soon is a cook. His soups and salads, broils, roasts and pud
dings, entree* and lollipops and loblollies are works o! art. They are to the
palate what perfume is to^ the nose and color and form to the eye. The- Gov
ernor of California is not an anchorite. Visiting the prison he tasted the crea-
tlons of MuhlVoon, and without inquiring what multitude ,of- sins his .cooking
covered, paroled him and took him home, to cook" for. hls\ private table." It Is
about the only case known where a parole 'has been issued .without the prisoner
or any peace officer or any one unofficially interested in the bencileiary asking:
for it. -The case orislnates in a letter from the Governor himself to the Â¦Prison-
Directors, stating: that Mah' 1 Koon was' probably innocent of any crime and re
questing hts parole. The Governor's request wai' granted. Â¦ Mah Noon got his
freedom and the, Governor got a. cook that won*t strike. '' ;'
There Is no evidence that the act wus for any other purpose except to serve
the Governor's personal convenience.. .".The flve : policemen, who rgrnve' battle ' to
this bloody highbinder and one of whom was shot. and. nearly killed. . in the
tight, bad' no information of the parole. Had. they been, asked they would have
opposed it. Mah Noon's merits- as n- cook do not impreMS them.';' They- know
him p.s one of the "most vicious and .desperate ; crlminnls '- that * ever. -lurked in
Chinatown. But he is the only cook ln ; the State that suits the Governor. There
are white and black cooks, male and female, who would be proud, of ' Â¦' employ
ment In the kitchen of the Governor. He says he Is a friend of the union laborer
and a strike settler extraordinary. There la a Cooks' Union, but no member of
It is fit to cook In hit kitchen. He Is also opposed to Chinese immigration and
commissioned an embassy to represent him In Washington and urge ConsreÂ»s to
evclndt- the Chinese, because they come here and compete Tvith v^hite union
labor. He found Mah Noon already excluded and non-comprltnc, and using his
poiver as Governor, admitted him to competition and landed him In his own
kitchen. One of his organs, the, weakest harmonica of the lot. says that the
Governor did this for r. poor und. friendless Chinese, an' Innocent, and suffering
human being with no one to love him. The fnet Is that If Mali Soon had not been
a tine rook he would still be doinR the poor and friendless human being stunt
Jn San Qarntln, takius opium on the sly and looking: forwnrrt to the end of his
sentence to transact some 'more bloody business in the alleys of Chinatown. There
arc good harness makers, carpenters, cabinet makers and other mechanics In
San Quentin and more than one white cook there in stripes, who can boss a range
nnd' bnlld gravy with the best Chinaman who ever wolloped a pot. Why does
not thÂ«.Â« Governor take a humaneâ andâ probablyâ Innocent spell in their behalf f
And here" Is the story of Mali Noon.

BATTLED WITH OFFICERS.
. At 20 -minutes after 11 on that
.night the Chinatown police squad was
ten. minutes late/in making its rounds,
owing to the presence; of the Grand
Jury, in the. Celestial quarter. Mah ,N,OQn
and his accomplice, Yung Ah Yee. were
thoroughly^ acquainted with the move-'

knew' that th'esqiiad would, pass the in

HISTORY OF CRIME.
timity to do so later, for Gage will be
retired to private life" very soon.
) Mali Noon was convicted of the' as
sault to murder Lim: Sier 'and 'was' sen
tenced to fourteen years'- imprisonmenti
He was hot tried for the assault ;to mur
der Police" Officer Tracy, and -the in-
TherPolice Department of San Fran
cisco was disappointed; when Mah Noon
was sentenced, to .fourteen years" in. San
Quentin prison. The officers had hoped
that the . murderous .'. highbinder ."would
be incarcerated for the" rest of his life.
Mali Noon twas. held for trial by the late
Police Judge Campbell on two, charges
of assault to murder. ' He '-'was tried* by
the late Superior Judge. Borden. - J. j.
Dunne, who! prosecuted for the "people,
is now located in Honolulu.
The fact of. being caught red-handed
in shooting Lim Sier stamped him as a
desperado, ready â¢ to murder for - his
price. The unusual crime of a Chinese
shooting a police officer caused the
peace guardians to look upon Mali
Noon as a' double-dyed \ criminal;
When' Mali 'Noon was sent to San
Quentin. prison the police officers felt
relieved. Now, by the grace of Gov
ernor; Gage,* Mali Noon, the criminal,
highbinder, ;would-be : murderer. ,'. . con
vict and probable murderer, is erij oying
the balmy air : of the ranch of the Gov
ernor in Los Angeles .County, pleasing

SHOOTS BRAVE OFFICER.
The history of the crime of Mah
Noon, for which he was sent to Sail
Quentin prison for fourteen' yearsr im
pressed itself vividly on the minds of
the local Police Department. There
is not an" officer of the police force of
this city who does not look* upon Mali
Noon as the most desperate highbinder
that "ever prowled in the alleys and by
ways of Chinatown. N
edly said that he regretted not having
killed ; the officer whom he had
wounded.
GAGE CON'SULTS HIMSELF.
It would be interesting to know from
the lips of Governor Gage by what
process he came to the conclusion that
Mah Noon was "probably innocent." '
Can Governor Gage say that he com
municated with the heads of the Police
Department to find out if Mah Noon
was a victim of a miscarriage of iustice
and deserving of a parole?
Did the Governor ask the opinion of
Lim Sier, the victim of Mah Noon
and his accomplice, Yung Ah Yee. -died
some weeks after he was shot. The
highbinders were not prosecuted for
murder for the reason that Lim Sier had
been attended by a Chinese doctor and
no evidence could be produced to show
that he had died from his wounds. . .
The only reason given . by Governor
Gage to the Board of Prison Directors,
in asking the parole, of the Chinese
highbinder, was that he (the Governor)
had reached the conclusion that Mah
Noon, was probably an innocent man
and that he would take the convict into
his employ.
TT\N order that Henry T.; Gage,
fa Governor of the State of Cali-
M fornia, might enjoy the dainty
\ JM dishes prepared by the .skillful
hands of a clever Celestial chef,
the chief executive has abused his pow
ers and secured the parole from/ San
Quentin prison of Mah Noon, one of
the most desperate and bloodthirsty
highbinders ever caught red-handed in
crime.
Governor Gage, who poses as the
friend of the workingman. has thought
lit to take to his own honiÂ£ in Los An
geles County and there install as a
cook Mah Noon, who in cold blood at
tempted to murder Lim Sier. one of his
race, and also shot" Police Officer P. J.
Tracy in resisting arrest for his murder
ous crime.
Mah Noon was not only caught red
handed in an attempt to murder Lim
Sierâ he also battled desperately;, with'
five officers and sought to evade arrest
by shooting one of the brave guardians
of the peace.
Mah Noon was also suspected of
having killed other Chinese in the high
binder wars of Chinatown, and when in
his cell at police headquarters he repeat-
If Governor Gage or the Board of
Prison Directors had consulted with the
Police Department "of this city as to
Mah- Noon's record' the information
.would have been forthcoming that the
criminal, highbinder and would-be mur
derer was the king of the hired assas
sins of the Chinese tongs. â¢"'Â¦-';Â¦ > â,'Â¦';â¢
IS KING OF HIGHBINDERS.
Did Governor Gage come to the con
clusion that Mah Noon was probably
innocent of assault to murder a fellow
countryman and a police, officer on the.
basis that. so. clever a chef v could- not
possibly be a monster thirsting for hu
man gore? Â¦Â¦''.'Â¦'-:' :
Mah Noon is an adept at the cooking
range. He can turn out the most palat
able of soups, entrees, roasts, broils and
confections and is deemed worthy Y bv
Governor Gage to tickle the srubernar
toFial. palate and prepare feasts fit for
Lucullus. .
Why did Governor Gage and the
Board of Prison Directors not follow
the usual custom and seek information
from the San Francisco Police Depart -
ment as to the record and career of Mah
Noon and the advisability of giving that
criminal a parole?
In what manner did Governor Gage
come to the conclusion that Mah Noon
should be shown executive clemency
and be paroled from San Quentin?
any of the Judges or officials of the de
partment of justice as to the wisdom of

retreat from the officers. Their desper
ate criminality -jmowed itself when they
ran toward the officers and gave battle.
Yung Ah Yee threw his big revolver
at the head of Officer Galloway ,and
dashed past .the police officers. Special
Officers Downey and Finn, who were
close behind the regular officers, gave
chase to the fleeing highbinder and
caught him a .block away on Dupont
street.
Meanwhile Mah Noon engaged Of
ficers Tracy, Galloway and Burke in
battle. The three brave officers and the
two special officers, who had returned,
threw themselves upon the murderous
highbinder, who struggled desperately.
Mah Noon had his smoking Colt's re
volver in his hand, partly hidden by the
wide sleeve of his blouse.
With yells of rage and defiance Mai:
Noon managed to get his revolver into
play. He pressed the weapon upward
until its muzzle rested against the stom
ach of Officer Tracy. Fortunately he
was unable at that instant to pull the
trigger, otherwise Tracy would have
been shot through the body. Mah
Noon, struggling desperately, -was able,
however, to- fire his big revolver, and
the bullet went * through the arm "of
Tracy, and the brave officer was dis
abled.
Tracy's comrades, Burke and Gallo-.
way, beat Mah Noon into submission
and handcuffed him. He was taken to
the police station, where he showed de

arrested him.

the Harbor Hospital and later on his
friends removed him to Chinatown.

Much praise was bestowed upon the
pretty vehicles, ponies and floats. The
bicycle division was one of the most at
tractive features of the parade.
The carnival closed with a ball to
night 5n tho pavilion at Grace Brothers'
Park. The hall had been gayly decorated
by the ladies. The grand march was led
toy Kins Marshall and Queen Helen, and
was participated in by all of the court
attendants.
Thousands of persons crowded the park
during the afternoon and evening, and the
ladies of the improvement club will have
a neat sum with which to prosecute the
work of beautifying the City of Roses
as a result of the juvenile rose carnival.
Grand Marshal Weston Anderson,
mounted on a ilower-decked pony, led the
parade. He was followed by the drum
corps, headed by. Master George Proctor
and the trumpeters. These were costumed
in white duck, with yellow tripes. Then
came nineteen little maids of honor, clad
in pfnk. .accompanying the float which
contained three tiny cupids in pink tights
and eauze skirts.
It was after the Greek fashion. Vith
flowing Greek sleeves and a long court
train. King Marshall was similarly cos
tumed, wearing white satin and silver.
His bearing was commanding and digni
fied and a fitting contrast to the flower
like beauty of his queen consort.
As a preliminary to the events at the
park the platoon of juveniles, costumed as
police, the drum corps and trumpeters,
banner.bearers and about 300 flower giris
marched down to the lower end of Fourth
street. Then the line of march was taken
to the park, wHere the coronation of the
youthful monarchs. Queen Heleu and
KJng Marshall, took place.
Immediately thereafter the floral par
ade was formed and passed in review
three times. On the royal float, which
'conveyed the fairy monarchs, was a pic
turesque throne. Queen -Helen wore a
pretty costume of white liberty silk over
a foundation of furah.

/tt^HE shooting of Lim Sier was a criott brutal affair, and Mah Noon, who

There is absolutely no doubt as to the guilt "of Mah Noon. I saw the
thooting myself and I know that Mah Noon committed the crime with a brutal
malice seldom seen in a Chinaman. Myself and Offlcers Tracy and Galloway were
going into Sullivan alley to report off when the shooting occurred. I heard the
first shot and ran toward the scene of the shooting just as Yung. Ah .Yee, who
fsred the shot that knocked Lim Sier down',- made his escape. â¢- S
There was a bright electric light -burning right over the scene of the brutal
s-hocting, and we could air see plainly what was going on. The wounded China
man was lying on the ground absolutely defenseless and without a weapon of.
any kind when Mah Noon '- rushed up . to him and fired a shot into his prostrate
Lodr. â¢ - * Â¦
We were not ten .feet from him 'at the time. We closed in on the highbinder
and he showed fight. He pointed his. smoking revolver at us, but we kept draw
ing in closer to him. ..When Policeman .Tracy grabbed hold of him his true des
perate character asserted itself. . Man Noon made, a desperate effort to kill
Tracy. He struggled with the zeal of a madtrmn, ; 'and pointing his revolver to
ward Tracy he pulled the trigger, the bullet passing through Tracy's arm.

WITH HIGHBINDER IN WHICH HE PLAYED A PART
r HE parole of Mati Noon is a great- surprise to me. . The fact that this
highbinder shot' Police Officer' Tracy in resisting arrest stamps him as a
desperado of the worst class.
- 'â. Â¦ I do not remember another 'instance -of a. Chinese highbinder shooting
I : .a police officer. Â¦ The highbinders will kill each, other,. but always have a fear of

" character of the manl .
i .--. It is a mo6t'dangerous';thing to parole a convict without consulting the police
* officials of the 1' city, ; where the man was convicted. The records of the State
.prison only show the offense for, which the man was convicted. In the case of
Mah, Noon -the Police; Department of this city possessed considerable information
.'as to his 'career/; : . Â¦ ' '
' ; ~ The â¢ Board - of Prison Directors shoutd have communicated with us and asked
for all information concerning. Mah Noon when the request for his parole was
received. â¢ ~ - '
' I certainly would not be in favor of pardoning a Chinese- highbinder or even
.of paroling him. Mah Noon's crime proves conclusively that he did not hesitate
to. Attempt ...to murder a police officer after shooting one of his fellow countrymen.
From what ; I know of his xase, there was not a single thing to warrant his
parole^, and not only should he be kept in prison for the term he was. sen
tenced, but he should also be tried on .the . charge of assault to murder. Officer

. J was never notified of the intention of the Governor or the Prison Directors
to rarole Mali Noon. The law was not complied with. In addition to the law
that they must get my opinion as to whether or not there are other charges, the
notice of the parole must ,be published in the papers. The latter step" may-.be
declared unnecessary only by the order of the Governor of the State, but I
riiust receive notice. I was never notified of Mali Noon's, parole, and If Â¦ I so

\/k/ ncse is of the most dangerous class.
r Y In all my experience as a member of the police force of this city I
always found that the highbinders had a fear of the police. Some of
the " hatchetmen who took part in bloody fights with their own race gave up
without a struggle when overtaken by the police.
Mah Noon shot one of his countrymen and also an officer who sought to ar
rest him. and the double crime speaks for itself, showing the malignity of the

shou'd have Bald at once that on no account should he be allowed outside of the

The police officers know the full extent of crime to which the highbinders
will go, and the shooting of Ofiicer Tracy v,as a most unusuaroccurrence. I un
derstand that Hah Noon was not tried for the ussault to .murder Tracy. He
certainly should be punished to the extent of the law. I think the power of
parole should be very carefully used, and a convict should riot be allowed outside
of tlie prison walls until there has been the most complete investigation. -
A man who has been tried arid convicted should not be paroled without the
circumstances being looked into in the same manner as is done previous to a

LOS ANGELES. June 7.â Public Admin
istrator Kellogg to-day said there was
nothing new or definite to give out con
cerning the $142,000 left by Charles Hill,
the mysterious old man who died several
days ago at the Good Samaritan Hos
pital, nor had any traces or communica
tions been found that throw light upon
the nativity of the decedent.
"It was not the intention of this office
to give out anything In regard to the
matter for at least a week," said Kellogg.
"We wanted to investigate Independently
and uninterrupted by the thousands of
fraudulent claims that 'will now pour in
upon us. Every effort will be made to
locate the dead man's legitimate heirs.
These will be brought to light, I believe.
In a short time."
Attorney Leon Moss, legal adviser to
the Public Administrator, said:
"Positively the only evidence we have
now as to the old man's life or nativity
lies in the cryptogram I found in his
trunk. This consists of what appears fÂ»
be a meaningless lot of figures arranged
in long rows, with several of them crossed
out here and there. On the opposite page
are the names of several cities, and it
may be that when the whole puzzle is
spelled out It will reveal something. Any
body Is at liberty to come and take a try
at itâ any one who thinks he is good at
solving puzzles.

These channels when found, it Is be
lieved, will produce great mines In ex
actly the, same state as the Sweepstake
bonanza in the old channel near Weav
erville. "When the ancient channels are
encountered they are easily identified by
the rourd pebbles of the old wash of a
geological formation entirely different
from any pebbles of the surrounding
country. The theory Is that the fine gold
now dredged along the river at Oroville
left the channels as nuggets, which wero
broken and ground up in transmission.
The famous Cherokee mine, from which
$lo.000,000 has been taken by "-washing
down a bank with streams from pipes,
comprised 4000 feet of an old channel. The
Magalia mine .which has yielded $2,000,000.
was in a lateral channel running into that
of the Cherokee. Here the peculiar peb
bles were followed into the bank and a
shaft was then sunk through the lava.
Dakin says that the old river channels
ran In a different direction from the pres
ent streams. >Â¦-.â¢,â¢*Â¦:Â¦Â¦Â¦,
The company of Eastern men has made
a careful study of the geography of the
Butte County foothills. It is satisfied that
the ancient water channels were affected
by the last eruption and flow of lava from
Mount Lassen, which the crater itself in
dicates to have occurred within 200 years.
The capitalists believe that the geological
phenomena in the mine shafts will show
the general directions of the river beds,
presumed to be from northeast to south
west, and will aid them in locating por

ered thinly, if at all. with lava. Their

gold, easy of access when located, than
has ever been taken from all the gold
mines of California combined.

The situation in the oil fields of the
State has hot changed materially in the
last month. Thirty new wells were com
pleted and drilling was started on about
the same number. The new rigs up on
the last day of the month numbered
slightly more than those that were in
view at the end of April. Most of the
wells brought in were In the smaller fleld3
and the new production consequently
shows a decline. The oil industry, so far
as 'the. field, work is concerned, Is in the
waiting stage.
By the beginning of the year the refineries of
California alone will be consuming more oil
than .was produced in the State In 1901.
To-day the locomotives and steamers are
consuming- more oil than was produced In the

The Pacific Oil Reporter, reviewing the
growth in the demand for oil for fuel
says:
_The business of oil refining in Southern
California is proving to be profitable, ac

New Franklin Oil Company, which -began
operations last January, being backed by
several producing oil companies, has de
clared a dividend for the run of five
months of 1 cent a share. The company
grew out of the co-operative action of oil
companies which pooled their oil and took
a share of stock for every barrel of oil

the railroad to Coo.? Bay until August 1.

WASHINGTON, Juno 7.â Truman G.
Palmer of Chicago continued, his state
ment on the subject' of American holdings
of'sugar lands In Cuba before the Senate
Cuban Committee. - ;; V
Summarizing the entire presentation, he
placed the number of Cuban estate^ held
by Americans, individual and corporate,
at 172, with a total acreage of ownership
amounting to 1,482,801, of which 330,816
acres are cane producing. The annual
cane capacity of thlg land he placed at
830,445 tons, but he said that the lands
were not producing to their full capac
ity and some of them not at all. These
American ownerships have waf claims
against the United States amounting In
the aggregate to $41,335,803. .Â¦ .'.'.
"Some of the American factories for
which claims for damages have been pre
sented," he said, "undoubtedly have not
been rebuilt, but neither the Spanlard3
nor the insurgents 'could have destroyed
the land which was in cane. The cane un
doubtedly was destroyed, but the land
must be in better condition to grow cane
after years of idleness than it was sev
eral years ago, when Cuba produced over
a million tons of sugar per season.
"Whatever additional scaling down may
be done on the statements submitted on
the basis of inaccuracies or misstatements
on the part of the claimants for damages,
the fact must be patent that the holdings
by American citizens of land In Cuba
which is or has been in cultivation are of
sufficient area to produce as great a crop
as tne entire Island turned out this year,
and this is less than one-fourth of the
total area owned by American citizens
and corporations."
ln this connection Palmer said there
were other large acreages of Cuban lands
owned by outsiders which he had not in
cluded In -his list. In this excluded list
he referred to the 150,000 acres of la'nd
which Sir William Van Home had In
formed the committee he had come into
the possession of.
The Conciliation Committee, represent
ing the beet sugar Senators, held its sec
ond meeting with the Republican mem
bers of the Senate Committee on Cuban
Relations to-day. The effort to reach an
understanding on the Cuban reciprocity,
bill was continued, but no agreement was
arrived at. The positive announcement
was made after the conference that the
differences are now no nearer adjustment
than before the first conference was held.

years has embodied the underlying principles of
civic stability and conservatism to so eminent
a degree that its name may well be associated
with the beginnings oÂ£ those material edifices
and monuments. of masonry which. In their
character, typify durability and strength.
It is especially fitting that this great broth
erhood of man, with its adherents in every
ccuntry and in every clime, possessing as it
does such vast antiquity, and devoted as lt Is
in its purposes to the Uplifting of the racÂ« and
the promotion of principles of humanity and
liberty, should be invited to celebrate with its
impressive ceremonies the laying of the corner
stone of a building belonging to this vast Fed
eral Governmnt. the world's great republic, the
bulwark of liberty and the one organization
of society among men upon which rests the
hopes of aspiring humanity throughout the
thÂ« shifting sands Of the desert the
pyramids of Egypt, that country of mystery
and age, stand as monuments to the patient
hours of labor of multitudes of unpaid laborers.
But buried under those' sands are the corner
stones which made thÂ«m possible. The wonder
ful cathedrals of Europe that have come to
us as legacies from the middle ages, stand, a
wonder to our eyes, filling our measure of the
beautiful. But to every one there Is the cor
nerstone, hidden from 1 view, and these won
derful and beautiful spires, towers and-min
arets exist only Because the cornerstones are
broad, adequate and true.
/As in the material edifice, so ln character.
The foundation must be sure. Only those who
build upon truth and sincerity have the chancÂ«
to arise from obscurity. The first lesson of
Masonry Is truth. Truth is the foundation of
all religion, and when these have parted com
pany, truth has taken the higher path. In the
human character. If truth is present, greatness
is possible; without it failure is Inevitable. -.

j County, conducted the ceremonies
I surrounding the laying of the cornerstone
I of the ijew Oakland Postoffice this after
1 noon. Special arrangements were made
j by the Masonic order for this event, and
I with beautiful climatic conditions, music
j and song, oration and solemn ritual, the
'Â¦ great gray block of granite was set in its ,
1 place and the walls of Oakland's first
Federal building will now grow rapidly
above it.
! When the Grand Lodge of Masons
agreed to conduct the services the local
arrangements were placed in the hands
of a committee composed of representa
tives from all of the Masonic bodies of
the county. These provided a parade, the
music of bands,- vocal selections and the
general arrangements. Grand Orator E.

i agreed to deliver the oratiorr;' and the cer

The members of the order -gathered at
the Masonic Temple in the afternoon.

marching music, but the boys 1 band from

few earnest words spoke of this event I
as inaugurating a new era for Oakland.
He expressed the hope that prosperity
and greatness would come to this citly
and that, no failure would come to either
the community or the building that waa
about to be dedicated to the public use.
Then followed the ceremonies of prov
ing the Btone with the square, level and
plumb, and the administration of the corn
of plenty, the wine of refreshment and
the oil of happiness. Grand Master Wells
then read the contents of the copper box
that was placed in the cornerstone, as
follows:
The fire is still burning, but it is prob
able that the Nevada House will be saved.
The total loss will not be less than $50,000.
Walstab is the heaviest loser, to the ex
tent of probably $10,000.
There. was little insurance, as the places
have been generally cancelled by the com

* Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, June 7.
There was a deluge of statements to
day in the charges and counter-charges
that are 'floating about County Assessor
Henry P. Dalton, G. B.. Daniels of the
Oakland Eno.uirer, Emil Nusbaumer, wtio
sprung the affidavits that caused" all ihe
trouble, and i'rank J. Moffitt. These
fctatements were consequent upon the sec
ond affidavit of George A. Oakes, and all
of them are what is sometimes called
"ealty." -*Â» -- :;_
Through these statements run such
words as "blackmailer" and "felon." re
marks at)out "hatcnetmen" and the use â¢>*
"threats' and "bulldozing." Defiance is
hurled by each side witn challenges to
sue lor libel.
On ihe whole, it is a merry war that
bids fair to get away from the question of
wnether lo5 books were ever delivered to
the county of Alameda in return for $1575
paid by the county. There are indications
that it will involve other issues, the own
ership of water companies and newspa
pers, and it may run up agaivits a candi
dacy for Governor. As for minor county
politics there is not a candidate for office
nor a "politician who has not taken refuge
in his storm cellar, for when such charges
as these are floating about and when
great forces are battling the safest piace
lor the small try is out of the way.
Frank J. Motnit. having been brought;
into the controversy, makes the declara
tion that G. B. Daniels "ought to be
wearing stripes in the penitentiary."
This, Moffitt announces, is libelous and he
dares Daniels to sue him for libel, civilly
or criminally, and offers to prove his as
sertion if such a suit is brought.
* DINGEE IS INTEEVIEWED.
William J. Dingee. president of tho
Contra Costa Water Company, has been
interviewed as to his connection with the
matter. Mr. Dingee resurrects the o'.d
charge that was made a year ago that G.
B. Daniels had tried to secure fw.OOO from
the water magnate, with which to pay
the note then standing at the Central
Bank lor the stock that Daniels nominally
heJd, and he says that the attitude of
Daniels and the Enquirer is due to the
fact that he refused to be "blackmailed"
out of that amount- "Blackmail" is a
hard word to use. but Mr. Dingee uses It
in apparent abandon.
. Emil Nusbaumer has a few words to
sÂ£y that are mild as compared with the&e.
lie coos softly, but there is danger in the
coo. for hÂ»* suggests that the people of
Alameda County have already paid the
piper and it is about time that they
Itarn v here their music is. "Nusy" is no
lcngcr full af fire and brimstone; he
merely wants to know where those books
are.
On the other hand, there appears a
blast in the Oakland Enquirer, set in
three-column measure, in which it is de
clared that the Contra Costa Water Com
pany is behind these attacks, and Nus
baumer and Moffitt are called "Dingee's
hatchetmen."
So it is that while the assembling of the
Grand Jury is being awaited the various
parties to these charges are not ceasing
their attacks, and each new assault adds
to wonder as to where it is all going to
end.
OAKES' SECOND AFFIDAVIT.,
Following is the positive statement
made by Frank Ji Mofiitt to-da,y:
The Becoqfl affidavit- of Oecrge Gates Is sim
ply an t-xcuse for making the first. - In effect
it is an admifrion that ail ihe material allega
tions of th? first affidavit are true. He does
not deny reeeMJOE the orders for the books,
that he hypothecated the orders with Lank
tree and "that he indbrsed the checks over to
G. B. Daniels. Kc does not assert that he
ever delivered the books nor does he claim
that the books v.-ere ever delivered. He does
r.ot allege that he received any of the money.
' Daniels excuses himself Tor plundering the
county by saying I am connected with the
Â¦water company. My connection with the water
company is admitted. It is well known that I
tm a stockholder in the company and there
lore interested in its welfare. Daniels has for
years been abusing me in his paper, and I owe
Mm nothing but ill-will. 1 believe he ought
to be w earing strides Jn the penitentiary. This
statement is llbelous. but I am personally and
financially responsible for it. and I will take
pleasure in proving in the courts that he is
a felon if he will only prosecute me. If he
will sue me civilly I will answer immediately
and deposit a certifW check for $5000 to
cover any damages he may recover. . I will
resort to no technicalities, but will etand upon
the charges made ln the Stedman and Cakes
affidavits. If he will prosesute me criminally
1 will gc into court at once and establish his
guilt.
DANIELS MUST" EXPLAIN.
As for Da! ten, I ha\~e no grievance against
him and bear him no Ill-will. Therefore I have
nothing to eay about his connection with the
affair. But Jjsnie'.s will have to show whether
he robbed the county or the stockholders of the
Enquirer Publishing Company.
William J. Dingee told this to a local
newspaper:
I would like to know how I can have any
thing: but antagonistic feelinjrs toward men or
a newspaper that have been slandering me day
in end day out for over a year, simply because
I refused to be blackmailed out of $55,000.
Emil Kusbauraer writes as follows:
Up to the present writing the situation is
this: DaJton and Daniels are charged with in
fiucir^ and elding and abetting the presenta
tion of two false claims to the county, one for
thirty notebooks and one for seventy-five
working rolls. This charge was made Monday
'8ft. As yet no books have been brought for
v.ard corresponding to the tills. As yet no
*ntries have bten shown from or upon the En
quirer books to show that such books were
made or delivered or that the money received
by Daniels as shown by the checks wai cred
ited to the Enquirer.
TAXPAYEES WANT LIGHT.
The defense thus fÂ»r ha* been that I am
connected with the water company and that
Mr. Moffit is my client. I apprehend that
while thesf matters may be of interest to the
taxpayers they want light upon the question of
whether or not this money waa stolen from,
â¢-the countyl Upon this question thus far .no
evidence has been furnished by the accused
that this money was not stolen; nor ha* much
theft even been denied. -
In reference lo Mr. Oakes. his written state
ment to me etill etznds uncontradicted and If
true shows him guiltless.
The Enquirer to-night publishes the fol
lowing:
George A. Oakes, ln an affidavit which in
printed below, throws a caldum-llght plow
upon some of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's methods in obtaining ammunltJoa to
fcuri at its opponents. He shows quite plainly
that Emil ICusbaumer. the political attorney
el Dir.gce, and Frank J. Moffitt. whose wak
ing and sleeping hours for j-ears have been
devoted to upbuild the Dlngee Interests, werÂ«
the manipulators of the liitest attack upon
Courty A*!Â«essor Henry P. Dalton and the En
quirer by its manager. G. B. Daniels.

purifying, and beautifying: the skin, for cleansing- the scalp
of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stopping- of falling- hair,
for softening-, whitening-, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands,
fcr baby rashes, itching?, and chafings, in the form of baths
for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free or offen-
sive perspiration, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses,
and many sanative, antiseptic purposes which readily suggest
themselves to women, especially mothers, and for all the purposes
of the toilet, bath, and nursery. No other medicated soap is to be

skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other foreign or domestic toilet
soap, however expensive, is to be compared with it for, all the
purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it; combines in

City Attorney Johnson Rejects Claim
OAKLAND, . June 7.â City Attorner
Johnson; has informed Mayor . Barstow,
who mad* a special request for enlighten
ment, that i William J. EmrtckVbiU for
$275 against the city for. repairing; lire en
gine No. 7 is an invalid claim, even though
the City Council did pass it twice in an
effort to get it through. The. City Attor
ney's opinion is based upon his discovery
that the City. Council acted independently
and without authority from the.poar'i of
Police and- Fire .Commissioners. The
E roper procedure, he says, would havÂ«
een for the City Council to make requi
sition upon the Board of Public Works,
but in ignoring that "body the City Coun
cil usurped the functions Â¦ of both the
Board of Public Works and the Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners. The claim
is void; too, on the ground that the re
pairs to the engine were not needed and
not requested o?> the Board of Police and
Fire Commissioners. Again, there is no
proof that Emrick did the work or that it
was inspected and reported to the proper
authorities. The City Attorney says that
previous to the ordering of the work by
the City Council Emrick had agreed. with
the Police and Fire Commissioners to do
the work for-$200. The dispute over this
claim is the outgrowth of the City Coun
cil's declination to pay^ $1300 to have a
new boiler put in engine No. 7. The City
Council undertook to prove that the work
could be done for $275, and so ordered Em
rick to do the work.

Mr. Savage- declared that Dr. Anthony
was treating his wife with the greatest
consideration, and denied that he had
ever heard her mental condition discussed
or questioned in any way.
T. J. Savage of the firm of Dorn & Dorrt
& Savage, is the attorney for Anthony.
When asked for Anthony's address Mr.
Savage begged to be excused from giving
it. Having -his case in court, he said that
he would certainly advise his client not to
talk about the matter.
Andrew Thorne. attorney, whose offices
are in the Mills building, said that he hal
never met Mrs. Anthony, but was acting
in her behalf at the instigation of* her
friends. Mr. , Thorne said that she was
not legally committed to the sanitarium.
He alleges that she was under restraint
at the branch. Mr. Thorne said further
that it had been his intention to take
habeas corpus proceedings, but had de
cided, upon learning that Mrs. Anthony
bad been'removed from the branch to St.
Helena, to bring the facts within the
knowledge of her friends and to the at
tention of the court, so that when the
divorce case was called lor trial her in
terests might be fully protected. .
When seen at his offices Dr. Lux said
that the letter he received from Mrs. An
thony was perfectly sensible, and the
handwriting did not even denote that tha
writer was suffering even from nervous
ness. , He admitted that he was refused
admittance to the branch of the St.
Helena Santitarium. and as .a physician
requested Dr. Brickhouse to be allowed
to see Mrs. Anthony. Ultimately he whs
given the privilege of seeing her. During
the interview, Â¦ the purport of which is
stated In the affidavit. Dr. Anthony came
into the room. He, too, said his wife was
of unsound mind. Mrs. Anthony then
asked him (Dr. Lux) whether he would
sign a certificate to that effect, and Dr.
Lux emphatically declared that he would
not. He advised that she be given a milk'
diet, and turning to her husband suggest
ed that probably he. Dr. Anthony, had
ordered a diet and treatment for his wife.
Anthony said that he had not done any
thing of the sort. Dr. Lux was greatly
surprised to see Mrs. Anthony in such a
position and is satisfied that she is not
mentally deranged.
LETTER IS SENSIBLE.
She said that her husband had taken her
there last Monday night and that she did
not know where she was until she woke
up the next morning. She informed Dr.
Lux that her husband told her that she
would be insane for six months r.nd that
he was. going to take her to the sanita
rium, and during that time she was not
to see the children. She also informed
the. doctor that Dr. Anthony had cast se
rious aspersions upon her character ana
had accused her. of conduct unbecoming a
lady during her voyage from South Af
rica to England.
Dr. Lux in his affidavit furthermore
says that Dr. Anthony and one Dr. Brick,
house, a lady physician in attendance at
the branch office of the sanitarium, said
that Mrs. Anthony was insane.
Dr. Lux declares that at that time Miss.
Anthony was not insane. He avers also
that Mrs. Anthony told him that her hus
band had brought his attorney to the
branch office of the sanitarium and that
she had agreed to and did^sign every
thing that was requested of her.
AT THE VARIOUS SUMMER RESORTS
In compliance with the request Dr. Lux
called on Mrs. Anthony. She was crying
and was mentally disturbed, and pros
trated and apparently in bad physical
condition. She looked emaciated and pale.
Dr. Frederick W. Lux, whose offices are
in the Mills building, has also made an
amdavit, in which he gives it as his opin
ion that Mrs. Anthony was of sound mind
prior to June 1, and was apparently In
sound mind and good health wiien he last
saw her. Last Tuesday he recefved the
following letter from Mrs. Anthony, sent
by special delivery: â¢ _
Tuesday Morning. Â¦
Dear Dr. Lux: Kindly call at St. Helena
Sanitarium branch office as soon as possible
on receipt of this. Doctor, I thought my trials
would all com* to an end once my husband
came back, but I can truly and safely eay
that they have just begun, and since my hus
band's return my" life has been hell. I will
explain to you when you come. . Excuse pencil.
I am all in bed. Yours truly, â¢
MRS. ANTHONT.
DECLARES SHE IS SAH"E.
Daniel J. S. Michau, in an affidavit, cor
roborates his wife and declares that Mrs.
Anthony never deserted her husband and
that on her departure from South Africa
Anthony bade her good-by and paid her
passage to San^ Francisco. "
On arriving here Mrs. Anthony was to
reside with her husband's sister. Michau
goes ' on. .to state that on visiting the
branch office of the St. Helena Sanita
rium last Friday' both he and his wife
were refused -admittance when a request
was made to see Mre. Anthony.'
Charles Buttlar's affidavit seta forth
that Anthony told him last Sunday that
he was not going to remain in California;
but intended returning to Johannesburg,
South Africa. Buttlar also states that he
believes that Ahthony' is endeavoring to
remove Mrs. Anthony from the influence
of her friends that he may obtain the di
vorce from her.
: Two days later Anthony told Mrs. Mi
chau that he had learned "all the evil
things about his wife through a Mrs.
White, a prophetess of Battle Creek."
Mrs. Michau charges that Anthony com
pelled his wife to write letters to her own
sister in South Africa in which she ac
cuses herself of misbehavior and, at the
same time, excuses Anthony of any fault.
Mrs. Michau further swears that Mrs.
Anthony had been made to sign papers,
the purport of which she did not under
stand.
FRIENDS of Mrs. Christina' J. An- i
thony appeared, -before Judge
Hebbard yesterday and made affi
davits in relation to her sanity,
and also wjth regard to her posi
tion in the * divorce proceedings com
menced by her husband. Dr. Kichard 13.
Anthony. â¢Â¦ Â» " Â¦'.- , -
it is claimed that Mrs. Anthony has
been taken to the St. Helena Sanitarium
under the pretext that she isJnsane:
Her friends deny.'that her mind is af
fected, and aver that there are reasons on
the part of the husband for \ his having
her confined in the sanitarium, he hav
ing only last Wednesday commenced di
vorce proceedings. . â¢
Dr. Anthony came into prominence
when he was arrested in South Africa by
â¢British soldiers, and was tried and con
victed on a charge of treason, and sen
tenced to be shot. His wife had already
come to San Francisco in company wiui,
Mr. and Mrs. D. J. S. Michau. and on,
hearing of her husband's trouble She "i
tereeaed with the State Department at
Washington with a view of gaining ms
relea^5e on the ground that he was a nat
uralized citizen of the United States. An
thony, through th.is intercession and the
facts laid berore the English authorities,
was released. Mrs. Anthony: wortted
day and night in his behalf, and even
went to Washington to aid in the inqui
ries incident to the case. '
Anthony, on gaining his liberty, came at
once to San Francisco, but now that tne
war is ended it is stated in one of the
affidavits that he intends returning to
South Africa. It is alleged, also, that he
informed his wife that during her stay at
the sanitarium she would not be able to
see their two children. In his complaint
for divorce, filed the day of her removal,
Anthony asks for the custody of the
children.'
"i FILES -DIVORCE PAPERS.
The fact of Mrs. Anthony's being taken
to the sanitarium on the Gay that Dr. An
thony filed the divorce papers, and his
application for the custody of the chil
dren, together with an assuring remark
of his to his wife before she went to the
institution that when she came out they
would live comfortably with their chil
dren, are matters that aroused the sus
picion of Mrs. Anthony's friends.
In his complaint for divorce Anthony
sets forth that Mrs. Anthony deserted
him on June 2, 1901. In her amdavit Mrs.
.Michau says that she has known Mrs.
Anthony for several years and that she
had accompanied her and Mr. Michau
on their voyage to San Francisco from
South Africa in 1901. Her conduct had
always been exemplary. Last Monday
Mrs. Anthony told her, according to the
affidavit, that Anthony had kicked her,
had kneeled on her back while she was
prostrate and had accused her of infi
delity. Mrs. Anthony called upon de
ponent on Wednesday and she then told
her that Anthony had said that he would
take her to a sanitarium for one month,
and after that period they would live
happily together with their chil
dren. That same afternoon she was to
leave on the train for the St. Helena
Sanitarium.

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
It has been a dull week in \ the stock '-, mar
ket, the volume of dealings for Tuesday run
ning down to the lowest total for any one
day in nearly two years! The general char-'
acter of the market was one of waiting but
there was evidence of liquidation by some'tired
holders and the professional element on the
Exchange were attentive to rumors of a for
mation of a formidable bear party with a cam
paign against prices in view. The great bear
leaders of past campaigns have been commit
ted to the protection of various Important
stocks for some time, and this has been an im
portant element In the sense of security in the
stability of tha market that has been felt
The anthracite coal strike has been a more or
less depressing influence and has served to dis
courage any attempt to advance prices in
other parts of the list. There were efforts
apparent by poo's in one- or. two cases to ad
vance prices after th e first of the week but
the lack of a market to realize on after prices
had been lifted discouraged these efforts and
the market fell into a state of profound neg
lect. There can be no question of the heavy
loss In earnings involved in the total shut
ting down of the anthracite mines and tho
withdrawal of the principal items of traffic
from tho coal roads. The calling out of the
engineers and pumpmen and the struggle on
the part of the mine-owners to keep their
pumps running and eave the mines from dam
age by flooding have added to the depressing
Influence of the strike on^yalues. The in
creased bitterness and hostility resulting from
the continuance of the struggle have addeJ
to the anxiety which it cau*03. The stocks of
the coaler* themselves have been well sup
ported and have not suffered acutely, but tha
effect is potent on the rnarkn at large. What
ever expectation was. indulged that the declar
ation of peace in South Africa would result in
stimulating the securities market was prompt
ly dissipated on Monday, when it was seen
that thÂ« order of the day in London was the
taking of profits by American holders of Brit
ish consols. This operation would naturally
tend to replenish the supply of sterling ex
change Jn New Tork. The higher rate for
money *-hich resulted from last week's large
loan expansion by the banks was at the
seme time an influence deterrent to making
remittances to foreign markets. Despite this
the course of foreign exchange haÂ« been up
ward, due to demand from bunkers to cover
maturities on bills sold heretofore in the
course of borrowing in foreign markets. ~ The
foreign borrowings by Am'.r.can .capitalists
were known to be very heavy at this time,
and the effect of the maturing of-thee* loans
from time to time during the remainder of t!ie
year is the subject of much conjecture. Much
depends, of course, upon the volume of ex
ports of our maturing crops. The promise of
a plentiful corn crop and especially the flatter
ing report of the cotton crop prospect by the
Government Weather Bureau are received with
gratification on this account. Great Impor
tance Is attached to. the ultimate effect of the
Boer peace in awakening activity in business
and industry abroad. Aside from the labor
troubles and the future needs to be met by
the money market, financial conditions are now
almost without exception favorable to values
The undertone of firmness and confidence in
the stock market is In accordance.
There has been some liquidation of specula
tive bond Issues and an irregular tone In that
department of the market.

NE^V YORK. June 7.â There was no cha.ng3
in the several repressive influences upon spec
ulation in stocks to-day "an.l r.he market was
practically idle in consequence. The policy
of the large interests in stocks seemed to be
defined as one of holding until the underlying
strength of the situation "merges from thÂ«
present obscuring Influences. Mean-while the
rrcfcssional manipulators are unable to ven
ture on a campaign against values. To-day
some influence on sentiment was . exerted by
the strike of the -?oft coal miners in "West
Virginia, by the increasing difficulty of protect
ing the anthracite mines from flooding by
keeping the pumps going, by reports of abund
ant rains in the corn belt and by the failure
of the bank statement to show any recupera
tion in the percentage of reserve against de
posits. While these facts had the effect of ab
solutely killing any demand for the
seillng induced was of quite insignificant pro
portions and the light play between profes
sional room traders whose "attendance at the
board was reduced to a minimum was all that
made to-day's market. Hardly a leading stoct.
on the list varied more than a small frac
tion.
The decrease in loans by banks was insuffi
cient to offset the decline of over $1,000 000 in
cash reserves, leaving- . tho surplus slightly
lower than last week . . - Â¦ : .-

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
The Financier says: The official statement
of the New York associated banks lor last
week showed a decrease of in cash,
instead of an increase of $36B,000. aa was
Estimated on the basis of the traceable move
ment of money during the week. The loans
were decreased $1,&&,000. This change waa
expected as the result of the light business
on the exchange, during the week and bo
cause 'of the subeence of important syndicate
operations - and the dlntributlon ofx Givldends
early In the week, these payments causing the
liquidation of loans in which the dividend
money had been temporarily employed. The
deposits showed a decrease of 52,4Â«'9,UOO which
amount .very closely agreed with the total
with the decrease of loans and of ca*h Th
required reserve was reduced $CO7,470 which

last week was $207,000,000. against S203 OOo
000 in the Previous week, indicating but a
slight increase in the volume Of business at
this center. If thli^usiness ' shall - continue
small, as seems llkely^to be the case in the
near future.' the surplus of the banks though
comparatively low. will doubtless be amnle
for all requirements. Comparisons of change
of loans by the principal downtown banks of
the week show a net loss of $3,800,000 and
the only notable losses* were by two institu
tions, one ' of which : indicated a decrease of
?1, 700,000 and the other 'of $l,S00, 000. \ The

MRS. K. OHLSEN
HOLDS HER OWN
Refuses to GivÂ« Hsr Hus
band Her Dowry of
$1400.
"Ehe told me she had $1400 when I mar
ried her, but I have never seen, handled
or received a single dollar from her." '
â¢ Such is part of the tale of woe told by
Liudwig Ohlsen in a suit for divorce filed
by him against Katlierine Ohlsen yester
day. Mrs. Ohlsen has been very success
ful In holding her own in other matters
than monetary ones ever since their mar
riage in 1889, if Ohlsen's complaint- is to
be believed, and she is 70 years of age,
while Ohlsen is but 45.
The Ohlsens reside at 3460 Twenty-fifth
street. The husband /conducts a- syrup
manufactory in the rear of the residence,
while Mrs. Ohlsen spends her time, de
spite her years, in hurling abuse and de
cayed vegetables at him from the rear of
their home.' She varies the monotony of
life, alleges Ohlsen, by threatening to
"eic" her two children, one of .whom is
41 years, of age and the other 45, on to
him.
Another cause of Ohlsen's unhapplness,
he alleges, is his wife's fondness for go
ing through his clothes while he sleeps
and abstracting therefrom his loose
change. %flHBpiaaBH
"She has taken $200 from my trousers
in this manner since our marriage," al
leges Ohlsen. -*
According to Ohlsen, his aged wife is
full of schemes for causing him annoy
ance, trouble and humiliation. - .
"Five months ago,'.' he alleges, ' "she
threw a whole gallon of water on me
when I was in bed. and during the last
eix months she has on many â¢ occasions
hurled dishes . at my head. She accuses
me of stealing marmalade and syrup
from my partner and of selling the stuff
and pocketing the proceeds."
Ohfsen asks - that he be granted a dl
vcrcc, and that his wife be compelled to
bear the costs of *he suit.
