THE historic Custom-house at Mon
terey is to be restored, thanks to
the efforts of the Native Sons of
the Golden West in arousing Cali
fornians from the apathy with
which, as. a rule, they regard the Epecta
cle of gradual decay that is attacking the
buildings which stand for so much in the
State's history: Work will actually begin
in a few days. Several attempts have
been made In recent years to raise a fund
for caring for the Custom-house, but all
were failures until the Native Sons took
up the matter about three years ago at
the annual session of their Grand Parlor
in Salinas.
Since then the State Legislature has
tr.ade an appropriation of J4200, and Gov
ernor Gage has appointed a commission
consisting of Mayor R. F. Johnson of
Monterey, Walter C. Little of Pacific
Grove, J. A. Trescony of San Lucas, Hon.
Frank Mattison of Santa Cruz and E.
Myron Wolfe of San Francisco to super
vise the expenditure of this appropriation.
The appropriation became available on
January 1 of this year, and. as soon as
the formal transfer of the lease to (he
Custom-house, which the Native Sons
secured from the United States Govern
ment in'lPOl. can l>e effected the State
commission will take charge of the "prop
erly and begin work.
The Commissionersâ all native' sons,
whose fathers or grandfathers were
prominent figures in early .daysâ feel a
personal interest In the work they have
In hand and are determined not to make
the mistake that so often robs historic
buildings of all interest, the mistake of
"restoring" away most of the. original
(structure. In restoring the building to
its former condition much boarding that
has been put up in recent years by the
caretaker to keep It from ruin will, of
course, be torn down, but no part of the
house itself will be removed to give place
t9 stronger material. The weak spots
will be artificially strengthened without
marring tho architectural character and
integrity, and the Monterey Custom
house will, declare the Commissioners
iemain the same in appearance and reall
ity as it was when Monterey was ' the
port of entry and principal city of Call
lornia.
Most of the old timbers are still stanch
which the Monterey Custom-house figured

and replace it with the stars' and stripes,
thus taking formal possession of the ter
. ritory in Â«the ! name of the United ' States
of America, A curious incident connected
with â¢ this I important .;' event and one not
generally known is that July 4. 1846,- would
have been the' date ; of ' American . occupa
tion .but for" the cunning of the 'Mexican
officials. They, knowing that I the , proper
formalities of thie - occasion could not be
complied with unless the Mexican flag
was hauled down before that ,of America'
was hoisted. { confiscated \ the j { Mexican
standard and kept it. securely hid for two'
days. ? The "Americans, ' however < "finally -
persuaded them that j the Mexican "flag
must be produced and on the, .morning of

house for the v fast time. The same, old

years occupied as a studio by. the talente'd
San -Francisco artist, ' Miss Evelyn Mc-

headquarters for California when General
Fremont' was In command and it was here
that Frempnt found* his 'wife when he ar

The most important historical event in
Strangely enough, the great old hall, in
which the officers of Commodore Sloat's
flagship gave this ball,' is now used as a
depot for the stones for the pedestal of
the Sloat monument which, the Mexican
War Veterans are slowly building at the
old fort on the neighboring 'hill.. A nuiri

Unofficially this old house has seen
many interesting and some thrilling
events, and many brilliant social gather
ings, the old chroniclers say, took place
within its walls. One of the most mag
nificent of t\ese was the ball given by the
officers of the United States frigate Sa
vannah shortly after the American occu
pation. This ball, was held In the im
mense central hall of the Custom-housa
and was worthy of note for many reasons,
chiefly, however, for the fact that at
tended as It was by all 1 the prominent
Mexican and Spanish families, as. well as
the few Americans who came to Monterey
prior to 1846, it marked the breaking down
of the natural hostility, of conquered for
conquerors and the beginning of the kind

has existed In California ever since. :'Â¦â¢

Monterey was merged into the San

had no official status and has fallen grad

The Custom-house Is, with the excep
tion of some of the older missions, the
oldest public building in the State, its
foundations having been laid by ' the
Spanish Government about . 1S16. The

Mexico revolted against Spain and the

occupation in 1S46. The two towers were
thus completed and the central portion

took possession and finished, the building'

house and for other purposes connected
Â¦with the administration of public affairs

"pleted the building will be converted into
a museum of California history, each
room being devoted to some man of great
prominence or to a particular period of
the State's history. The work of collect

and a number of very interesting relics
have been promised. Among these are
the dtsk and pen used in drafting and
signing the first State 'constitution and a
certified copy of the signatures (the orig
inal document being in the State
archives), two* chairs used by General
Fremont while in Monterey, a chair be
longing to Governor Micheltorena and
several relics of Rev. Walter Colton, the
builder of Colton Hall. The plans of the
commissioners also include beautifying
the' grounds surrounding the building- and
converting them into a public park: There
are between two and three acres of land
in the Custom-house reservation, extend
ing along the shores of the bay, and no
prettier site for a park could be found.
and the thick adobe walls have crumbled
very little, although the house has stood
for nearly a century, and the. plans of
the Commissioners will not be difficult to
carry out if the work Is done with care
and judgment. The only portion of the
restored structure not originally there
will be the tiled roof, and as all except a
very few of its own tiles have been car
ried off by relic hunters, or broken in va

obliged to find tiles from other less nota

Easy Lessons in Whist.
Â«-jpiiis is the first of a series of easy
lessons in whist for both experts
* and beginners. Even if you are
a clever player you will find this se
lies full of useful hints and new
plays. If you know nothing whatever
about this fascinating game you can
learn it here, after the most sdentiflo
methods. . .
The lessons are being -written, ex
pressly for the Sunday Call by Mrs.
E. P. Schell, who is a prominent
member of the San Francisco Whlflt
Club, where she gives scientific in-*
etructions to the lady members, and
chairman of the whist section of the
California Club. The success of the
whist and euchre games at the Palace
Hotel recently, with 80O players, was
due to her efforts, therefore she is
best qualified to present the rules of
the game so that everybody can un
derstand them.
gO much has .been written by our
local writers on the original open
ing of a whist hand that I shall
take up second hand plays, covers,
fourchettes and imperfect four
chettes, and shall endeavor to make clear
the Importance of covering certain 1 cards
led. The rule most generally laid down
is, If. you hold high cards, from which
you would lead a high card, you 'play a
high card. For the same reason when a low
card Is led with a low-card combination
second band you should play a low card,
as a high card will only assist in estab
lishing your opponents' suit more expedl
tlously.
For example, If you hold king, queen
and two small and you play low on a low
card led you are taking the same risk as
If you were leading low from same com
bination. '
Also when your holdings second hand
consists of ace. queen and one or more
small, and jack is led, you should cover
. with ace; it is seldom right to play other
wise. You should usually cover a card led
late in hand to prevent underplay.
Another most important play Is with
king and two small on ten being led. You
should hold off. as more than likely if
originally led It is from ten, jaek, queen
and others. Even if it is from an irregu
lar opening It would be wise to hold off in
any case. If you put up the king and ace
' . . 1
cards immediately above and *â¢*>**?
one led. such as king jac* on a queen
led, or a queen ten on a jack led.
An imperfect fourchette Is the combina
tion of the card Immediately above th%
one led and the next but one below it,*
such as ace jack on king led. or king
ten on queen led. Suppose that the queÂ«n
la led. and second hand hold* king, ten
and others. By covering the
not only prevents tho third hand from
finessing If he hold the ace, but he may
make the jack good In fourth hand.
If the jack is in third hand with the
ace. second hand still gains an advantage
by covering, because the lead Is then on
his left and his guarded ten must be led
up to. whereas If he passes the queen
his kin*, ten will be led through a Â»Â«cond
time, and ace, queen, jack will all take
tricks against him.
If tho original leader holds the Jack and
the queen la passed, the second hand I*
in the same disadvantageous position, for
he will be led through again with .the
jack. By putting on the king, even if be
loses It. he remains with second beat
guarded in the. suit. . _
A very instructive deal criticism by C
E. Coffln: - . â¢-
(a) Avoid changing suit*, â¢
(b) Lead through the strong a? to the
weak hand.

lead them; you are weak enough to fore*
opponents. ' . ' â¢

Tricks 1 and 2 â North and west open
their respective long suits in the conven
tional" way.
Trick 3â South leads through probable
strength., in west's hand I up to declared
weakness In east.
Trick 4â North avoids changing suits,
there being no apparent reason for chang
ing, and continues- his -clubs.- which forces
the ace- . .
..Trick 5r-West properly continues to lead
his* diamonds, which north trumps and
south discards.
Trick 6 â North now leads the command
of his suit, which. forces a trump from
west and thereby unguards his queen.
Tricks 7 and 8â West does not want to
continue his diamonds, as both opponents
are void of that suit and "the weak
hand would, trump and the strong hand
discard a losing card." He therefore prop
erly opens his heart suit, which south
wins on the second round.
Trick 8 â South winds up the game by
leading trumps and winning all tricks ex
cept the. last, which fall to the best heart
in west's hand. The score can be changed
at the third trick and a. loss of three
points by south's failure to perceive tho
advantage of "leading through the
strong," but unwisely opens trumps with
no good suit and none indicated in his
partner's hand. This resulted In two tricks,
but left the queen in command with west.
Scruth then opens his long suit of hearts,
which is> won cheaply by west, who prom?
erly continues his -diamond suit, which %
won by. north, who, knowing that the aco
of clubs Is against him, returns his part
ner's stilt of hearts, which faTls to the
major ten-ace in the west. West now
leads, his commanding trump which take3
them all out except the one in south/a
hand, which he forces with his queen of
diamonds. This leaves him in command
of the suits and he brings in his diamonds

THE SUNDAY CAIjt
fy-f LITTLE girl of 12 led a young
f I scrrel colt out before a bright.
frâ 1 treshly painted cart, on which the
V. I deep vermillion pigment was not
JL yet dry. Because the, duties of a
weh-ored equine were still a mystery to
the colt it did not like the color, of the
cart any better than the first Â»3t of tiny.
polished, metal shoes with which it had'
just been fitted. It was still all a-qulvei
over the ordeal at the smithy, and when
the red cart flared forth before its wildly
rolling eyes, lilte a glaring danger signal.
it prepared at once to establish a "sphere
of influence" ail its. own.
Its first impulse, however, was to quick
ly and quietly withdraw from the stable ,
yard and leave the rod cart in undisputed
possession, but the little Â£lrl of 12, with
the aid cf a brand-new whip, checked this
impulse on the instant. Then they both
proceeded to argue the question, the colt
meanwhile maneuvering for a position as
lar from the red cart as the narrow con
fines of the stable yard would permit.
The little girl of 12 was a strong and
sturdy and mettlesome miss, with' large
Hashing eyes and . masses of brown hair
tossing in becoming abandon about her
htay. She had a mind of her own that
would brook no opposition â not even at
the ecst of spoUing a new white dress.
The young sorrel colt 'was also sturdy
and strong and mettlesome and unaccus
tomed to beir.g ordered about. It felt that
it was too young to be trifled with. More
over, it took less account of the new white
drtss than even the little girl of 12 herself.
But the young sorrel colt and the freshly
painted red cart were gifts just received
from her father, and having a mind to
display her new possessions in conjunc
tion in a drive through the park the little
girl of 12 was in no mood to be thwarted.
Nor was she â at first. Much to the sur
prise of the young sorrel colt, and. If the J
truth be known, to the little girl of 12 as
well â it was soon harnessed securely be
tween the shafts of the freshly painted
red cart, and high-stepping dizzily
through the first stretches of the Pan
handle driveway, with the little girl of 12
sitting proudly erect on the seat
But when that dazed feeling began to
wear away the young sorrel colt suddenly
realized how degrading is servile bondage.
If it would be free it must strike, or
rather kick, for independence, now or
never. It kicked, and in a few minutes
nothing of the freshly painted red cart
was left attached to the young sorrel colt '
but the shafts.
Then the co!t bolted. It knew not
whither, but wherever it went the little
girl of 12 was never farther behind than
the lencth of the reins that twisted a
cruel bit in its mouth, and thus, despite
its most frantic efforts to escape, it was
taken back, humbled and conquered, to
the stable yard, where the freshly painted
cart was piled up In sections, while the
little girl of 12 calmly walked home
to reassure her distracted parents that
the big red spots on her new white dress
were not blood stains, but only inartistic
daubs of i>aint.
That was how Miss Bertha Gardner and
"Sweetheart" became acquainted five
years ago, and the lesson in obedience
which "Sweetheart" learned that day has
never been forgotten. Since then the
sturdy little girl has grown to a robust
and fascinating maidenhood and the
young sorrel colt has become a big, proud
steed, as wiry as a mustang and as fleet
of foot as a racer. Since then, too,
"Sweetheart" has learned many other
things besides obedience and, incidentally,
in the teaching of these accomplishments,
Miss Gardner has become known as the
most daring horsewoman in the park.
On formal occasions she -wears the con
ventional black riding habit and looks
staid and prim on a side saddle, but for
her own comfort she prefers her natty
suit of brown corduroy, with its jaunty
little jacket and the divided skirt, reach
ing but a few inches below the knee to
nitet high patent leather boots, the tots
of vliic.ii are thrust daintly Into ihc
heavy leather bound stirrups of a Mexican
cross saddle. With a red vest to give a
touch ot color to the costume and a
suaw "sailor" or soft Alpine hat, worn
more for security than style, she is a
ljerfect picture of the healthy, sport lov
ing, girl of the West.
Tims mounted she rides like the wind
with the careless ease and grace and se
curity of a trained cowboy. Aftd in all
the accomplishments that have made the
American vaquero the most brilliant
horseman in the world, the simile is not
inapt, for Miss Gardner can twirl a lariat
an skillfully as she rides.
This fact she recently demonstrated in
a sensational runaway in the park, when
she dashed to the rescue of two women
in a buggy and brought the frightened
animals to a standstill before either of
the women fully realized their periL To
them the runaway was almost a tragedy
and their pretty savior a heroine of won
drous bravery. To Miss Gardner it was
simply an incidentâ a little excitement to
relieve the monotony of a daily canter
nothing more.
But she loves the thrill of danger that
comes with the risk and - uncertainty of Â¦
mastering a spirited animal. It is no
unusual sight to see her hurdling over ail
sorts of obstructions In the wild stretches
of the park or racing madly through the
breakers in a Dervish-like ride down the
beach that sends the foam flying and
drenches both horse and rider in briny
epray.
Thus "Sweetheart" has been trained to
ell sorts of sensational deeds. She has
been taught bjt her young mistress to
stop suddenly in full. flight, rear straight
up on her hind legs, turn completely
round vrith a swift motion and go plung
ing back over the course she has come
alert ' whenever ;she~ was out with me.
After that she . learned the difference be
tween trotting and ; pacing, ' single- footing
and galloping, so that she will do any of
these things now t whenever I, tell her to
.without the . necessity of | touching the
reins, gripping the saddle, with my knees,
shifting : my position' or any of the cus
tomary methods of training a horse. f
"Whenever I say 'trot' she trots. When
I say 'gallop' she gallops, and so on. It's
much easier that - way. I could ride her
without either saddle or bridle. She un
derstands me so perfectly that when I
command her to turn to the right or to
the left she turns. â¢ : - -
"After I found that I could control her
so well I taught her to hurdle. This -was
easy. "All that. I had to do was to ride up
In front of an obstruction and tell her to
jump. She jumped. In this way, when 1
command it) she will jump over even an
imaginary - hurdle. Then came stair
climbing and bucking like a bronco." She
doesn't like to do this, for It jars her as
much as it does - me when she goes
straight up in the air and comes straight
down again, with all four legs as stiff as
ramrods. It's funny to see her do that.
Didn't you ever see her â really? Oh, you'll
laugh. Just watch." ,
Miss Gardner rode out .into the middle
of the driveway, laughing .softly to her
self at the spectacle she was about to
create. "Sweetheart" looked docila. even
drowsy, in the warm sun until the com
mand 'came, sharp and clear. "Buck,
Sweetheart, buck!"
Instantly "Sweetheart's" whole' de
meanor underwent a complete change.
She became the very picture of untram
meled vicipusness. She kicked and snort
ed and careened madly about, turning,
twisting and plunging forward with the
peculiar side-winder motion- that has
made the "Western mustang the worst
animal in the world to ride. "With every
moment she developed a new frenzy,
until it seemed that both horse and riaer
would go crashing down Into a shapeless
heap.
"That will do. Babe."
"Sweetheart" stopped as suddenly aa
she began, and in a moment was stand-
Ing still, with the old, docile, drowsy air
strong upon her again. The contrast was
absolutely ludierous.
"Oh. isn't that fun!" laughed Miss
Gardner, brushing her disarranged tresses
back into place under her hat. "I think
it's perfectly jolly. After I got her to do
that I 'taught her to prance and dance
to music, to shake hands and follow me
about like a dog, and all sorts of things
like "that. ,
'"then one day we were challenged to
an impromptu race to the beach. We won,
and I was so glad that I exclaimed, *Oh,
you ought to stand on your hind legs.
Babe, and make your bow for an honor
like this. Come,-, stand up.' Much to my
surprise, she did',- j <i"d almost unseated
me. Now she likes.', ta plunge for me. Can
she hold the pole for; a-ptcture? "Well, Just
say when you are ready, and see."
The'photographer made a small circle in
the sand of the driveway. "Sweetheart"
was' driven in it, the photographer took
the focus and at the word "ready" the
horse rose straight into the air and stood
poised there for several seconds while tho
picture was being taken. The scene was
remarkable for its . tensity. If the horse
should' lose its footing- and go toppling
over â¢ backward 'the* daring young rider
would be killed instantly. But Miss Gard
ner has more confidence In "Sweetheart's"
skill and self-control than even "Sweet
heart" herself. .
"Now watch her do that same plungÂ«
without me," said Miss Gardner, slipping
out of the saddle. "Are you ready?"
"Ready," answered the photographer.
"Up, Sweetheart, up!" commanded Miss
Gardner, and without moving a foot from
the circle the horse stood on its hind legs
while the second picture was taken.
The whole performance before the cam
era was truly remarkable, as the pictures
themselves amply demonstrate. There is
not another horsewoman in the "West who
can ride as this young -woman does; but
she thinks it is nothing to boast of.
"I'll soon be too old to ride in divided
skirts," she says with a sigh. And that
is her only worry just now. Â¦*Â»
"Is that her. real name? Oh, no; not ex
actly. You, see, I call her anything that
comes into my mind first. Sometimes It's
â¢Babe,' then it's 'Pet', or 'Darling,' or any
thing nice like that. It's not the name
itself that she listens for; it's the way it
is said.
'.'Oh, you maybe sure she knows when
I am angry. Then she gets nervous and
skittish and restless. But.I;have to get
that way sometimes, so that she can see
the difference when I am kind to her. Of
course, 1 don't spoil her; that "would nev
er do; but I have to treat her that way
to keep her fiery and active. If you be
gin that way with horses and keep it up
from the very first it is easy to teach
them anything you want.
" 'Babe's' .first lessons were how, to be
have properly. Sometimes she would

HERE is Die s?cond, and last, in
stallment in a memory test for
-a prize. It is not only unique;
it is exceptionally important and in
teresting to parents and children
alike.
On "Wednesday afternoon, March
12, a representative of The Sunday
Gall arranged, through Superintend
ent of Schools Webster, to have forty
pupilsâ eight each from the Lincoln,
Clement, Hamilton, Horace Mann and
Mission Grammar Schools respective
ly-r-assembled in one of the class
rooms of the Lincoln School to listen
to a short talk by Chief of Police
Wittman, and to reproduce the same
as a memory test, together with a
minute description of the speaker as
en observation test.
The children â the brightest and
cleverest in their classes â were equal
ly divided as to sex, four boys and
four girls from each school, but the
object of the meeting was kept a pro
found secret from them. Not one of
them knew what they were to do,
whom they were to meet, or wKatthey
would say. It was to be a memory
test pure and simple, with absolutely
nothing to put them on their guard
before it began. They did not even
know that there -was to be a reward of
merit. They were told to report at
the Lincoln School and await devel
opmentsânothing more.
The Chief was unavoidably de
tained by the Grand Jury and arrive-l
half an hour late. He was ushered
in with the brief introduction, "This
gentleman will say a few words to
you." Without any prelude he made
the brief speech which was taken
down verbatim arid which will be
found below. Then he left immedi
ately. v
After he was gone the children
were given the fifteen questions^ also
reproduced on this page, and asked
to answer them. The result- is sur
prising.
Children are said to be even closer
observers of personal peculiarities
than grown-up people, and as Chief
Wittman is a man of most notable
appearance, he was a good subject to
test their â¢ receptive faculties. Tho
impression he made on some of ?.he
pupils is astounding.
The test is truly interesting as
siiowing the value of school training.
As a reward the five children who
gave the best answers will be taken
to the Lick Observatory on Mount
Hamilton by The Sunday Call, be
cause such a trip presents exception
rlly fine educational advantages, be
s.'des affording a pleasant outing. As
a supplementary reward a prize of
$ 15 will be given to the boy or girl
who writes the best description of the
trip.

peculiaritiesâ their habits, and in fact Everything that comes within my ob
servation. I have to pay close attention to details and store them up in my
rr.Srid and be able ,to recall them at any moment.
This faculty is necessary to every one In whatever line of work he .may
oe. The perceptive' faculty is a good one for boys and girls to cultivate, and
like ethers it can be mastered only by application.
Success in life in every line depends on application to the matter in hand,
and this faculty is a very essential one in all lines. These young men 'here
may be the Pierpont Morgans of the future and these young ladies the wives
of millionaires. Large duties will de volve on them. You may have to enter
lain large companies and you must remember the names and faces of your
guests. This brings in the faculty of observation and memory. In fact, in
ail walks of life the leaders are those that have risen through strict atten
tion to details, which is a great" factor of success.
When you get home at night try to remember, what transpired during the
dayâ Â«ach little eventâ and the people you have ctfme in contact with. Culti
vate the- habit of remembering dates and faces.
I hcpe to see you a pain some time and talk to you individually on differ
ent subjects. You are looking at me and I am looking at you, and I hope
we win know each other next time we meet. When you see me on the street
coine up to me and see if I can remember you. Come up and say: "How
do you do? Don't you remember me?" See if I say, "Yes, I met you at the
Lincoln School Wednesday. March 12." That will pu^ me to the test. See if
I r ractice what I preach. If I don't remember you, then you'll have the laugh
on me. Good-day. . .

The scarf is wound and knotted at the

The Coronation comes in different colors.
The smartest combination is a rich bronze
straw and a dead white satin scarf. The
scarf is twisted loosely about the crown,
finishing in a great wide bow across the'
front. Two wings on each side are slipped
thi< ugh this bow, pointing as if the own

of vieir colors is perfect.' They are pure

The mt.in thing to remember about the
tailcr hat is that it must be low and
fiat. Otherwise it has not the mark of
liÂ»J2 stamped upon it. Having seen to it
that your hat is low and flat, you can
risk almost any shape that you desire,
the mc:e rakish the better.
Swaggerest ci ah is the coronation, lis
name proves its Jiove:tj. It has a low,
round crown like a child's hat; it rolls
high at each side iilike and u^s shaij,.y
over the nose. Like all the rest of the
season's shapes it is worn far forwaroâ
far enough to hide the forehead and shade
the eyes. This fashion is certainly com
fortable en a blindir.gly sunny day, but
it is provoking in the way it hides a
pretty face.
The novelty of the season is the fabric
with which they are trimmed. It is Kuzu
cloth, a sort of coarse grass linen, very
close In color to the tint of the cocoa
straw which is the foundation of the
hats and which sometimes forms part ol
the trimming. This cocoa straw is made
in Japan, by the^ wayâ did you know
that? Many of our straws are. Of course
the Japanese know nothing about what
we want in the way of new shapes, so
they export the braided straw to our
Country and it is made up into hats.
Wouldn't it frighten the poor little Japs
if they should see the fantastic forms
that their work is woven into? Their main
idea of a head-covering is a picturesque
paper parasol, certainly far more artistic
than the chapeaus which we conceive.
The plain band which was being for
saken last year has almost disappeared
now. The tailor hats are trimmed. Sim
ply, to be sure, but trimmed in some surt
of way. A scarf, a quill, a wing â any
of these give softness and break hard
lines.
To the g^rl who possesses that elusive
thing calied styleâ a thing that starts in
the sure placing of the fcot and does not
stop until it includes the correct stab of
the hatpinâ these hats are a satisfaction.
They are in harmony with her. She
shows them off to their best advantage.
But to the woman without style â and
there are many of her, and pretty, too â
they are utterly impossible. They become
merely dowdy. It takes an air of great
crispness, sjiap, ginger, to carry one of
these hats off.
They are tremendcusly smart this year,
the tailor hats. That's not saying that
they j?re pretty. The wildest flight of
imagination could not find beauty iu a
straw coal-scuttle wrapped with a scrap
of what looks like a gunny sack. But
swagger they are â dashing, daring things
such as never were conceived before.
They cock up rakishly at ail sorts of sur
prising angles; they flare ovyr the nos=e

Proper Way to Care for Plants.
THE ranks of the amateur flower
growers swell annually, and that
the number is riot larger is probably
due to the lack of knowledge on the
subject. "Luck" as a factor in suc
c. â iul floriculture is becoming more and
more discredited, and common sense, com
bined with ' a little labor and a growing
experience, are making veritable bowers
of beauty of what would otherwise be
cheerless rooms. ,
The immense pleasure derived from thÂ©
wealth of bloom of some choice plant or
plants, perhaps received as a gift during
the holiday season, generally gives rise to
a desire to keep it or them j in- a healthy
condition for future blooming periods.
The first and most important considera
tion is - the temperature Â¦ of t the rooms
where plants are ( kept. The extremely
Tiry heat of the average living room dur
ing the daytime, and the : chilly drafts
entering / around Â¦ the windows on cold
nights, are more often responsible for the
quick .death of our floral pets than the
florists from -whom they are secured. .'â -' ;
heat causes two serious difficulties,
namely," a. forced and consequent weak
and , spindling growth . and the rapid in
crease of plant insects and parasites. This
can ;be- overcome ; in "a great- measure by
occasionally spraying the plants on bright
days,- and. by constantly keeping a pan
or other -flat vessel filled wlfn water, on
the register or heater. The moisture re
sulting from the evaporation will make
the air of the room more agreeable for
human beings as well as for the plants.
The best .V plan,"' however,, is to keep the
plants in a room where the warmth comes
in from - some V other . part of the house
through a connecting doorway. Â¦
- Cold - drafts : earning directly in contact
.with' the plants, particularly at night,
generally, result in a bad attack of mildew,
if not, in the prompt loss . of plants. If
for any: reason it is Impossible to remove
â¢ the plants from . the window every night
during. extremely cold weather,' they- may
pe ; protected by placing : several : thick-

THE week beginning Sunday, April
13, will be under the dominance of
Mars, Saturn and Neptune, with
Mercury in a negative portion.
These conditions will yield a propi

new movements in commercial interests
instituted.
There should be events of great politi
cal importance occurring during the days
of this week.
Speculation should be on a large scale,
but a reaction is likely to take place be
fore the week Is over, with a decided
drop In some lines.
Health sigr.s are generally good. The Â¦

toward the back. Therefore the effect of
the brim is wide in front. The scarf that
The Upton is a charming affair when
looked upon from one side; from the oth
er it is a plain sailor -without any partic
ular beauty. That is one of the curses
of most of this year's hats, anyway. They
demand that a woman go about turning
her left cheek to all the world, whether or
nit she be smitten upon the other. They
Insist that she seek the right side of the
church and the theater, so that the. rest
of the audience may gaze upon her left
side. And we can't all sit on the right
side of the houseâ what are we going to
do about it? â¢
The Upton is a moderately broad
brimmed sailor, like the Ascot and j the
Tork. Its brim is turned directly up at
the left side and fastened there, or ap
parently so, by a big cfne-looped bow
which the scarf forms. The bow is tied
as the amateur can never tie it. These lit
tle touches are what mark a hat as smart
âand they are what we pay for in buying.
The materials are an infinitesimal propor
tion of the price. We pay for skill which
we cannot copy at. home.
The scarf of. the Upton is stitched in
ornamental bands at the ends. Strong
blue is the color of the thread used. It Is
a coarse thread. It gives the only touch
of color to the neutral tints of the hat.
The prices of these tailor hats run from
55 to $8 50. The latter is the price of tha
Coronation. It seems a fabulous sum to
pay for a straw frame, a bit of silk and
four wings; but if you raise objections
the makers will ask you what you can
copy It for yourself.
And you kno^r very well that you muat
throw up your hands.
The York sailor comes trimmed with a
gay foulard scarf. This foulard is striped
broadly in- white and figured bands. The
figured ones rje designed tn overlapping
disks of varying sizesâ bright Yale blue
or gÂ«lden brown are the most -prevalent
colors of the design. The knot is tied
very much aa that of the Ascot, but you
hardly realize this fact, for the foulard
takes upon itself a soft, drooping effect,
while the grass linen, is crisp and starchy.
The ends of the foulard scarf are unfin
ished, being left to fray at their own
sweet will.
The scarf is tied in a double knot in
front, the wide ends being pulled through
and allowed to flare in big fans that open
toward each side. The lavender bands
show like stripes running across these fans.
The result is charmingly youthful, and
the hat. is altogether prettier and less er
ratic than any of the "others.
The Ascot has a pronounced roll upward
In front. Its scarf is of Kuzu cloth,
trimmed in two-inch bands of panne
satin. A delicate bluish lavender is the
most popular tint for these satin bands.
The sailors have taken it upon them
selves to tip slightly up in the front and
down in the back, just as the hats do
that you see aboard a man-o'-war. They
are usually trimmed In the front with an
immense Alsatian bow, that 13 wider even

manner of the Alexandra. The chief dif
ference, and an important one. Is the way

THE SUNDAY CALL.
NOW T'IS THE TAILOR
HAT
6on sentry duty, or starting off for towro
It seems to him that this is the most of be
ing a soldierâ this and wearing a uniform, J
and living quite decently in barracks.' and
drawing rations and $13 a month. And he
enlists. . " Â¦:
First of all comes a suit of Uncle Sam's
livery. For artilleryman there is the
dash of red with- the blue. The recruit has
but a cord of red about his hat, and red
facing to his cape, but there, is always
the possibility of a corporal's or ser
geant's chevron with a narrow stripe for
the trousers. These non-commissioned
officers come from the ranks. And if war
comes on and makes opportunity, a non
commissioned officer may earn shoulder
straps and a commission. A sergeant has
already added a saber to his pistol, which
is the recruit's only weapon.
For a little while the novelty of the
thing and the conscious pride a uniform
gives, alike to private and major general,
keep his interest alive. But before the
creases are well out of his clothes the re
cruit is wishing himself anything but a
military man. He has wakened from his
oream.
It takes more cool nerve to be a light
artilleryman than to be any other sort of
soldier. In time of acMon a battery is
ordered to a position and there it must
stand its ground, no matter how hot the
fire of the enemy, no matter how eitipty
Â»he ammunition box; must st*nd. helpless
and exposed may be, until the command
ing general orders it away. There- is
nothing of the eye-for-an-eye feeling that
the infantryman has as he loads ami re
loads his gun down in the thick of the
fight; or the backbone renewing enthusi
rism of a cavalry charge.
An officer in the lght artillery has no
f.se for a man who hasn't nerve in every
square inch of him, and if a man has any
white feather about him it does not take
long to discover it.
But first he will probably have hfs turn
at the "bull ring drllj," as they call the
men's first lessons in horsemanship. ; . v
It is all as new to the horses as it js
to the men. for they, too,- have come from
the peaceful pursuits of ranch and town
life to learn the arts, of war: and there is -
many a day* when, the Presidio "bull
ring" would make -Buffalo BUI tear his
hair in a frenzy of envy. f} â¢
There are many surprises for the horse
before he learns to haul a gun as. meekly
as he wou!d a plow, and stand stock still
when the guns are fired. : '. ;
A young, unbroken horse- has to be put Â¦
â¢^Â¦f SHOUT, a saber signal, a trum
f I pet callâ .
Aâ | "Forward, march!"
I In answer, the clatter of gallop-
JL ing horses, the rattle* and clang of
harness and chain and dangling scab
bards, the heavy rumble of wheels, and
a battery of light artyiery dashes into .ac
tion on the Presidio plain.
The guidon flutters, flamelike, high In
air; the sun dances on saber edges, glis
tens on cap peak and spur, and glosses
the flanks of horses whose white hoofs
seem barely to touch the ground as it
slips past.
Blue-coated men In the saddles urge the
horses on, and other blue-coated men,
the cannoneers, sit with folded arms on
limber and caisson, so stiff and straight
they seem a part of the carriages.
Biankets ana chevrons and trouser
stripes of reii give splashes of color to
the picture.
It is a splendid pageant of war, this
mad forward dash of a battery.
"Halt!"
The order echoes from captain to lieu
tenants, from lieutenants to sergeants.
The horses fail back with a plunge half
made, the wheels jerk to a standstill.
"in batter} 1 !"
At this order the caissons stand fast,
and the pieces dash to the front, the six
horses swinging with a wide curve that
reverses the piece. Even before the -wheels
stop turning the cannoneers pivot and
diop from their seats, those on the cais
sons running forward to a position at
each side of the .piece. In the bat of an
eye there is a man at each wheel and two
between to unhook the limber, and the
limbers trot back to a. position covered
by the caissons.
There they stand, grim and pitiless, the
six death-dea'.ers of the battery, ready
for the touch of the gunner.
One can close his eyes and see the Inno
cent-looking puff of whitish smoke, .and
hear the dull roar â yes, and the groans
from over yonder where men are falling.
But ' there is no smoke, no roar,- no
groans. It is not wholly real, this daily
practice in the art of killing men. --
There is no firing of field guns at the
Presidio. Now and then a battery marches
off to Monterey, or other points not too
far away, for a season of gun practice.
The jrunner must know his business when
a. battery of lipht artillery takes a posi
tion covering the enemy. This is one of
the many parts of being a soldier.
A light artilleryman is made, not born.
And the making of him Is a long and
tedious task. From a raw recruit thrilled
by his appearance in the uniform of blue
and thankful for so easy a $13 a monthâ
from this embryonic soldier, thrilled and
thankful, to the tense-nerved, clear-head
ed man behind the gun giving out death
from the narrow black muzzle of a field
piece, is a weary way of monotonous
routine. Most of the men wish the get
ting out were as easy as the getting in.
Discipline is irksome to the man who is
too lazy to be anything but a soldier, and
the ranks of the army are not recruited

gun. . A gun detachment consists of two
corporals | and five privates, with thr6*
supernumerary cannoneers at the caisson.
Each man has a place to stand, a certain
duty, to perform for every maneuver. He
must know this place and this duty.
The moving of, the piece by hand, the
unlimbering of it, the taking and replac

these -are preliminary to the main com
mand, â¢ "Commence firing!"
At this every man is alert. The gunner,

command: ."Load, ready, fire!" He opens
the breech, inspects : the bore, broech
mechanism < and gas check, 1 while two of
the cannoneers step .between the piece
and.' the- wheels , and apply the- brakes on
each side. Two more men run to the Um

caisson, corporal a round of ammunition,
alternately supplying the gunner with
projectiles. The , ' gunner : shoves the
projectile Into the bore, pushing It in by
hand until it is beyond the 'seat of the
gas check. Then one of the men at the
a second primer is inserted.
As soon. as the piece is fired, it is run
forward to its former place, the gunner
opens the breech to allow the piece to

duty of sponging and unloading. .. â¢
- As in the school of the Â¦ cannoneer the
recruit learns the manual of the piece, so
in the school of the driver he learns the
care of the horse and harness.
There is method in every movement.
In the stable every- Inch of leather has Its
place. Each piece must be picked up in .a
prescribed manner, the blanket must be
folded by rule, and every strap of the
harness must be buckled precisely like
every other strap.

TUNNING DOWNS ARISIAN(Copyright, 1902, by S. S. McClure Co.)
THE woman who takes a daily bath
is actually born again into a
fresher and fairer womanhood.
No prescription that a physician .
can giye will relax wearied mus
cles, soothe quivering nerves, patch a
worn temper, or as quickly rejuvenate
and beautify as the morning "tub." Be
sides being atonic and a stimulant, baths
are like exerciseâ they set thin people on
the way to accumulating flesh and reduce
the surplus of avoirdupois for stout folk.
Soft water, Â¦ pure soap, two towels, â¢ a
. soft and rough' one, and ten minutes of
time are.the only requisites.
The moment of rising from the bed is
the best time for bathing. The body Is
warm, and therefore can withstand mod
erately cold or cool "water better than at,
any other time. It is relaxed,- and requires
The ordinary plunge or tub bath is not
complete without the shower bath, ac-
Let no woman deceive herself, however.
The muddy-brown look which the neg
lected skin cannot be removed
by washing the face and neck alone. An
ablution of the whole surface of the body
is ; necessary. , This clears the complexion
and makes the skin elastic and smooth
as satin. The skin also loses the tendency
to shrivel and contract on the application
of temporary cold.
An" important step, to be sure, to the
attainment of beauty is the night bath,
and if _ possible one never should retire
without removing from face, neck and
hands at least the accumulated dust of
the day; the wornout cuticle, which peels
off the face when not promptly removed,
spoils the complexion.
bracing, and the nerves, deadened by the
night's repose, require a gentle stimulus.
If a warm bath Is preferred, f let It be fol
lowed by a dash of cold water. A warm
bath at night is restful to many people,
but if one is very tined the exertion of
bathing -Is too fatiguing, and sJ footbath
or a handbath will be more restful. â¢ To
Immerse the feet or hands in hot water, Is
always soothing.
To-day there is a different bath as a
ranacea for almost every ill. If a woman
is overwrought and tired, she. has a bath
.prepared in such a way that it soothes the
nerves. : Another bath acts as an invigor-
If a shower bath is not possible a good
substitute is a cold sponge bath. .To be
come accustomed to cold bathing, begin
with a towel dipped in cold. water, wring-
Ing it thoroughly and rubbing the body
vigorously. Gradually increase the
amount of cold water In the towel, and
presently you will find yourself bathing in
the coldest of -water.' .. You can massage
yourself by vigorously rubbing, kneading
and manipulating ; with open or clenched
hands. All this is done after the body is
thoroughly dry. ,
cording to some sanitarians, who claim
that It .has an invigorating effect on the
system unknown to the tub bath alone;
that the shock of falling water given by
the shower stimulates the surface circu
lation and produces a healthy glow that
is not only very refreshing, but counter
acts the enervating . effect produced by
the hot' tub bath, affording a splendid

and closing the pores of the skin, giving
the bather a delicious sense of renewed
vitality. 'Â»
In cases of insomnia the hot bath has
been known to produce sleep when noth
ing else would. It should be taken quiet-
To reduce flesh, there is the lemon or;
lime juice bath, and nothing is more re
freshing on a hot day. Indeed, the lemon
bath originated, in the tropics. Remove -
the pips from three or -four lemons and
the' outer yellow skin, leaving the rest,
cut in slices, and put into a jug of boiling
water.:. Cover, iip' over night. In the
morning strain aftd pour" the lemon water
Into the bath.
Rose water and milk Is the bath for the
woman who would take on a little ' extra
flesh. Queen Isabella of Bavaria bathed
dailyin milk, containing rose water. The
famous bath of the .beautiful Russian,
Marie Czewertinoska, was a cask of
malaga wine, placed in a silver tub; in
this she plunged herself every morning,
after which the tub was emptied and a
fresh cask provided the following day.
- When the Parisian takes an aromatlo
bath, the tub is lined with a linen sheet,
gored so as to> fit the tub. The bath bag,
containing many aromatic ingredients,
herbs, spices and perfumes," Is thrown in,'
and the tub being almost filled to- the edge,
the bather gets in and stays there until
she Is perfumed through and through. A
cologne bath acts as an invigorating tonic,
so does a lavender bath, only In a lesser
degree.' The lavender is crushed and left
for three days In white wine vinegar, then
strained and bottled and used as needed.
Verbena leaves, plucked and thrown Into
an earthenware jug of distilled water, left
for days and then strained and added to
a little alcohol in which rose leaves have
been steeped, is also a refreshing prepa
ration.
This is the recipe: Take a pound of
thyme, sweet marjoram, hyssop, .mint,
sage, rosemary, borage, crushed rice,
crushed barley, boll in two quarts of wa
ter, adding a handful of salt. Strain and
add the liquid to the bath. Lait virginal
Is a preparation for the bath, which Is
also restorative and. buoying. It requires
rose ' water, four ounces; tincture of
myrrh, two ounces; tincture of. benzoin,
two ounces; essence of citron, two
drachms. This being the proportion for
two quarts of water. Â¦ â¢'.

thin, to make her fat, and the one whose
sole purpose is to beautify.
It is said that nervousness is kept out
of the celestial empire by the use of soft
soled shoes. The hard soles worn by the
Anglo-Saxon race are the cause, in <a
measure, of the extreme nervous temper
ament. Would we not be more amiable
and therefore more beautiful if we wore
soft soles, at least, when at home?
One . relief from fatigue is to plunge
the feet in ice cold water and keep
them immersed until there Is a sensa
tion of warmth. ' A bandage, wet with
alum water, and put on when retiring, is
excellent for strengthening tender feet.
A warm, bath, with a handful of sea
salt in it Is about as restful as a nap.
Paddle In it until It cools, dry with a
rough towel, put on fresh stockings, have
a change of shoes. If one could take the
time in the middle of the day to change
the stockings for a fresh pair we should
not hear so much about cold feet or
rheumatism.
For the .pedicuring process cold cream*
nail polish, nail powder, chamSla pad. a
box of pumice, dippers, chisel and round
chisel are required- "With the clippers thÂ«
nails are cut, the square cat being the
proper shape; this obviates the danger of
ingrowing nails. After being cut the nails
have a little polish rubbed on with the
chamois pad and then a dust of powder.
The chisel and round chisel are for the
treatment of corns, and should only be
used by one who has had iomÂ» Instruc
tion from a chiropodist. They axe a*
eharp as a razor and used to par* away
corns. Any callous places or rough skin
are rubbed down with the powdered pum
ice or emery paper and the cold cream is
rubbed over any tender parts of the feet,
or the feet may be massaged with thÂ».
wnolllent. Immediately after being taken
from the bath, and before the pedicuring
process begins, or Instead, they may be
rubbed with arnica or alcohoL The toes
must be kept as straight as possible;
when there la a tendency to crook or
overlap each other, It is well to place a
thin splint under them at night, tied
closely against which they can be held in
place.
An alcohol foot bath is a method of
securing, by absorption, a very exhil
arating effect.' A gallon of 90-proof alco
hol will suffice for several baths, and as
the only accessories are a hot brick and
a little cologne, this latest idea is not an
expensive one. The method of procedure
consists of dropping the hot brick into
the alcohol (previously perfumed) about
fifteen or twenty minutes before using:
then,' after ascertaining that the liquid
is just hot enough not to burn, the feet
are immersed in the foot bath, and, after
covering the tub with a cloth, to prevent
any escape of the vapor, you sit and re
flect upon the _bliss of existence.
Aside from the dally bath, the feet
should have their own particular bath.
three times a week at least. Her fresh
complexion and sparkling eyes, onÂ© wo

due in a great measure to her very care
fully kept feet. The foot tub should b*
three-quarters filled with. soapy water, as
hot as can be borne; while the feet are
soaking, the toes are gently rubbed and
manipulated all the time. This prevents
lame joints and sometimes corns. The
feet are rinsed first In tepid and finally tn

<J7vP STORY has just been told about
//\ pure gold found in this instance in
lf~^\ river sands, that reads. like superb
iiction. No one would give it the
slightest, credence if it were not told by a
scientific man of unquestionable authority,
for it is one of the strangest narratives
that %ver adorned a very dry and thor
oughly scientific piece of writing.
It comes from the pen of Mr. L. Gentil
Tippenhauer, who has been making a
geological investigation for the govern
ment of the Island of Haiti. The results
of his work, witfc maps, have been pub
lished in a seriea of papers In Peter
mann's Mitteilungen, one of the most
scientific of German publications. Tha
following is a translation of the story as.
it appears . at the end : of Mr. Tlppen
hauer's papers:
"I will: make mention, In conclusion, of
a very peculiar phenomenon. As I was en
gaged in a miscroscopic Investigation of
the gold-bearing river sands I observed
that the 13-year-old daughter of my com
panion, L. Aboilard, had only to lay tha
- flat of her hand on the sands and parti
cles-of gqld dust would adhere to it.
Every tim% she repeated the action her
palm. was almost covered with "old dust
that continued to cling to It. Whenever
she grasped a . handful of sand she would
shake her hand, the sand would fall to
the ground, but the > flakes of gold would
. remain clinging to It. i&SMMHBMI

of the gold reduction works at Para
maribo, and . others â¢ have borne witness
to the fact that ; the young girl possesses
this remarkable peculiarity. The ,num
beriess particles of iron mixed in tha
sand did not cling to the girl's hand.
. .."I must, therefore, come to the conclu
sion that < there is in Â¦ nature a power
Â¦whose influence in attracting gold is sim

It was her first experience in an Ameri

Some American gentlemen in the stupid

"Isn't the Alcazar management clever
to bring a Jap into the audience now to

Mrs. Seashore Small-Pond pit-patted to

remarked, casually.
It had the awe-inspiring: sound of au

The maid wore a face of non-assent.
Mrs. Koike explained In English.
The welcoming face of a manager greet

the room where Mrs. Belasco, alias Miss
Crosby, was changing her nationality by
means of a touch of grease-paint and a
black wig. The Japanese woman who I*

Cho-Cho-San sat rearranging ornaments
in the wig while Mrs. Belasco was arch

"She make them too high," whispered
Mrs. Koike to me when the awe of the
dressing-room mystery began to wear off.
"She says you make your eyebrows too
high," I told Madame Butterfly.
"Like Chinese, no like Japanese," ex
plained Mrs. Koike, standing by her col*

"Why, to be sure," assented Mrs. Pred,
comparing the real Japanese eyebrows

I suggested a hat.

had been harnessed, American-wise, with
tailored jacket, starched collar and heeled

And thereupon 'all our technical and

paid by one little Japanese womanâ the
play made her "homesick."
"She must be ver' like Jap'nese woman
âthe play must be ver' like Jap'nese â
cause I feel so homesick," concluded Mrs.
Koike, with a sniffle into the paper hand

She was very quiet all the way home.
I tried to drag criticisms from her, and I
gathered her opinions that Miss Crosby
walked and stood with approved Japan

was more to be pitied than blamed for

She approved of Mr. Belasco' s makeup.
His screen-panel poses were realistic

The entrance ' of the marriage broker
called forth another gurgle of recognition.

and the rich man. j There is much hard
truth in these readable essays of Mr. Jor
dan, and those who take up the book at
first merely for its breezy and entertain
ing style may pause to consider and learn.
Here is a bit that he has to say concern
ing the New York tenements, which wia
serve to show the author's clean cut and
forceful method of expression: .
"The most sumptuous dish for camp is
baked, stunted trout This can be accom
plished better near a farm or store where
materials can be secured. Only a large
fish Is worthy of being cooked in this
manner. Begin by slitting the lower part,
take out the gills and inside; wash thor
oughly; cut incisions two Inches apart
along the sides, and skewer pieces of fat
bacon in the cuts. To prepare the stuffing
chop separately a piece of suet or fat
pork, some Bprigs of green parsley, four
small onions, the yolK of a -hard-boiled
egg, and a little dried sage. Take three
cups of -rolled bread crumbs, add a few
cloves, mix thoroughly together and
moisten with a cup of white wine. Put
the stuffing in lightly and ekewer the fish
securely. Place it carefully in the bake
kettle, pour in half a pint of white wine
or hot water to prevent the fish from ad
hering, lay on the fish some pieces of but
ter and place the kettle in the hottest
part of the fire. Baste at Intervals. It
should be cooked in fifty minutes."
Another article In the book is devoted
to "Some Notes on Cooking Brook Trout,"
by Mr. Rhead himself. He gives recipes
for the best results in the camp when
the fish can be taken from the stream to
the fire; they certainly have the right ring
and are appetizing enough, to make one
long for an opportunity to try them In the
hunger-creating air of the mountains.
Here Is the one selected for the camp
rest-day, when there is plenty , of time
to delight the palate as well as to satisfy
the inner man:
In his article on "Winged Enemies of
Brcok Trout," J. Annin Jr. gives us an
excellent idea of the serious loss of fish
eggs and young fish when they are left
to their own devices to hatch and make
their way Id the streams. There is prob
ably not one person in a hundred that
realizes what an important part is played
by the birds of the air and aquatic fowls
in the destruction of the embryo fish. The
only remedy against such odds is the
process of artificial propagation, now in
vogue under State Fish Commissions. A,
Nelson Cheney writes a paper covering
this matter of artificial fish hatching as
well as can be done in the limited space
of a short article.
It is estimated that not more than 5 per
cent of the young trout hatched in na
tive waters escape from their' enemies
and attain maturity; by fish-culture
methods, to which we are indebted for
the perpetuation of the trout, a percent
age of. SO to 90 per cent is ordinarily,
reached. â¢ â¢ Â» The sense of hear
ing in all species of fish is a matter of

sing 'I Won't Go Home Till Morning,'

high limit of your voices, and the trout

bottom of the boat, and presto! the pool

bank with a careless tread, and. when

J. Berg Esenweln, A. M.', Lit. D., pro
fessor of the English language and lit
erature ? in the Pennsylvania Military
Academy, has written a small volume en
titled "How to Attract and Hold an
Audience," that should prove particularly
useful to those desirous of preparing
themselves for the stage, for the law. the
ministry, or as public speakers. Professor
Esenwein handles his subject in a highly
scientific manner and yet writes in a
popular vein that is not above the heads
of his possible readers. His work Jia
neither technical nor theoretical, nor does
he treat his subject on the plan of the old
elocutionary manual. His expositions and
explanations are straightforward and
How to Attract and Hold an Audience
Contrary to the expectation aroused by
the title, "Lepidus the Centurion," by
Edwin Lester Arnold, is not a tale of old
Roman days, but instead is concerned
with English life of the present time. Be
yond a touch of unreality lent by an un
usual plot, the situations are vivid, well
connected and plausible, glowing under
the author's splendid imaginative power3.
The study of modern social life, with its
tinge of the ancient, becomes all the more,
interesting through the blending. The
author is afforded a fine opportunity for
mild sarcasm, rich uumor and striking
dramatic effect, all of which he is the
first to perceive. For the rest, this is. a
story without a villainâ whose absence^
is not even missed, so rapid is the action"
âand with, a heroine well worth the
struggle which culminates here after two
thousand years.
For those who admire a story with a
touch of the supernatural, when that ele
ment adapts itself to vivid delineationâ
as in Bulwer Lytton's "Coming Race"
and Bellamy's "Looking Backward"â this
plot will have special value. (Published

"Much discussion arose some years ago
as to the trout flopping Its tail at o

drown it, and thus render its prey more
easy to capture. In rapid or turbulent

age of a trout from its size, weigh*,

The first paper is by Charles Hallock
and gives a "General Description of the
Trout Family," written in a half scien

of even the most casual dabbler in mat

about the general distribution of the fish,
gives us a summary of American trouts
with their common and scientific names,
and shows In a new light how the trout
has really been a potential factor in the
advancement of civilization.
The volume is made up of eleven arti
cles, by various experts with rod and reel,
selected and edited bv Louis Rhead. In
the preface the editor says that it was his
original intention to issue a series of vol
umes under the title of "A Library of
Rod and Gun." He hints that if the pres
ent book meets with a kindly reception
he still may carry out his original
plan. Judging from the worth of this
book to all who love and appreciate na

healthful of all sports of the field he de
serves a demand to more than equal his
expectation. The articles selected vary
to cover the subject from the poetical and
beautiful side and the technical as well.

dull heart indeed that will not warm to

of these enthusiasts of the stream; your
hand will itch for the feel of the rod, the
jerk of the line, the splash, the glorious
fight and the splendid victory that comes

those feet are pretty .well under his con

sengers.
At the billiard table all the men gain
quickness of motion and eye, accuracy of
touch, steadiness of nerve. They need
plenty of these. On the forty-four miles
of the round trip a good many things may
happen.
There are wagons, horses, bicycles and
automobiles for the gripman to look out
for. There are people who rush dowrfside
streets, waving for the car to stop. There
are bell signals to give and* bell signals
to respond to, and they must be given
and responded to quickly. One bell means
"stop," two bells mean "start," three
mean "back." These are the words that

"We never employ absent-minded men,"
says Harris. "Sometimes there have been
fellows seeking work who were alFright
in every other way. They were faithful
and strong, but their absent-mindedness
made them useless to us.
"We can tell how they are In this re
spect after the trial that we give them.
This trial lasts two or three weeks, ac
cording to whether the business is abso
lutely new to a man or whether he has
had some experience on another f road.
During the first three days of the trial
the prospective gripman Is not allowed
to touch the : levers Â¦ once. He merely

The room set aside for the gymnasium
is far too small for the purpose.. It was
a sort of left-over room on the California
street side of the building. When it was
fitted up nobody realized how popular a
place It was , to become. Of course, the
company cannot require their men to
practice there; they have to depend upon
keeping alive an interest in the exercise.
This interest grew ! and waxed so great
that it overflowed the apartment. Now at
the "off -hours" there axe men waiting for
their turns at the apparatus.
So here Is, a big benefit that the grip
men get from the gym work. The con
ductors do,' too, and it is of use in their
business, for they are called upon to give
hurried signals and to manage the brake
at the rear end of the car In many a
time of emergency.
Just here, on this point of presence of
mind, the gymnasium work comes in. - It
is a benefit claimed^ for physical trainine
everywhere that it develops this faculty.

frowsy heads or hair stiffened with gum

beauties of the first class, bought in Cir

the Sultan's pleasure. The handsomest
girl of the lot cost no less than $50,000,
which is an Immense price, even for a .
beautiful Circassian girl, warranted to be
the genuine article. But, then, she is de

As the Sultan journeyed he received gifts
of great value from communities and

his .royal master. He started a popular
subscription to raise a fund for purchas

the rule rtands that the older line sha.l
be given the top rope. Now, the Hyde
street line is, unfortunately, young, and
must let its elders take precedence. It
has the underneath rope every time. This
means that the gripman must let go in
order to cross the line having the top
rope, and then there isUhe big yank of'
taking it up again. This is no work for
soft muscle.
So in the gymnasium the muscles are
toned up. There the men work like prize
fighters in training, cutting their lunch
time in order to "stiffen up."
J. W. Harris, the superintendent of the
road, started the gymnasium a good while
ago, and the men took such an Interest in
it that a club sprang up and grew about
It. Now a billiard-room adjoins th"Â»
"gym," and there are card tables and
newspaper tables to help the 1 men to find
amusements in place of those that are
forbidden.
Cummings and Jacksonâ "Big Jack" he
is to those who know himâ are the giants
of the road, and they intend to keep up.

they leave their cars at 1 o'clock in the

easy that nobody knows It is missing, and
It is sufficient to keep all the news of the
day delivered at the room.
The gymnasium apparatus is simple, as it must be in so small a
space, but it serves its purpose nevertheless. Our men keep their mus
cles in good training even with a few minutes' exercise every day. Most
of them, spend a much longer time. They are to be seen hard at it every
noon when they are off duty.
The right arm of the gripman must be as good as a prizefighter's,
and we intend to have it so.
"When I established it for them I thought of it chiefly as a place of
recreation. Our men are not allowed to visit saloons while on duty, and
it occurred to me that the best way to enforce that rule was to give them'
something else to visit. So the room was fitted up and they took a grent
interest in it. Soon they formed a club of their own with the gymnasium
as a nucleus, and now they have a billiard table, card tables and the
daily papers all in the power-house in their little clubrooms. A fee of 10
cents a month provides for the expenses of the club, so nobody feels
the dues heavy. . " Â¦
IT takes big muscle to guard the grip.
That is why we employ big men to do the work- After we have
tested them and found them stiong enough, we go to work to make
them stronger. We have a "gym" for their especial benefit, and nobody
knows how many accidents may have been avoided by its use.

diameter 12 feet and displacement 120
tons. Too great length has been found an
obstacle to good work, probably because
they require space for generating power
to furnish a speed which can be obtained
only at the expense of handiness. A sec
tion of the skeleton of a submarine boat
in its early stages of construction much
resembles a series of hoops waiting to
encircle a cask. The same section in a
later stage, when the metal plates have
been riveted outside the hoops, resem
bles, looking through the interior, a view
through an underground railway tunnel.
The submarine boat is built entirely of
metal; the hull is circular, in cross sec-
exhaustion of stores and movements of
weights; modeling her to -meet the phy
sical requirements of crushing strains and
the tactical requirements of handiness;
ballasting and trimming her so that she
will have sufficient stability and at the
eame time move readily in obedience to
both horizontal and vertical rudder ef
forts."
According to William W. KImball the
v principal difficulties met with to-day in
designing a submarine torpedo-boat are
as follows: "Providing for sufficient
stored power of a kind that can be eco
nomically expended in driving her when
submerged; devising a good method of
directing her toward an object constantly
changing its position; installing an effi
cient armament; retaining a fixed center
of gravity and fixed weight in spite of
few seconds the man in the turret would
take an observation, a torpedo would bÂ«
fired and the boat would dive, again imme
diately, oblivious of the guns that would
probably be trained upon the -spot where
she disappeared, and not come to the sur
face again until well out of the way in
some entirely unlooked for spot. The ves
sel can come to the surface from a depth
of ten feet, make an observation and diva
again'' completely out of sight within ten
seconds, in which space of time It would
be. practically impossible for a warship
even with her rapid-fire guns and a
knowledge of the submarine's position, to
land an effective shot. ;
4 With -no idea of where the submarine
will next appear, combined with a feeling
of uneasiness which is sure to prevail
when such a boat Is in the neighborhood,
it will be seen that the submarine is des
tined to be a most potent factor In coast
and harbor defense. The best submarine
that can be built at present will not be a
fast boat, must be more uninhabitable
â¢than surface craft and of limited time
endurance while moving in fighting trim.
With the provision that can be made on
a battleship for carrying one of these
submarines, it is not Â¦ at all improbable
that they will become equally efficient for
offensive work many thousands of miles
from ; their home station. As their cost
ig comparatively insignificantâ about
thirty could be built for the cost of a
battleship and . the crew of one battleship
could man nearly one hundred submarine
boat3â they will form an inexpensive and
most efficient means of defense for about
thirty important cities on or near our At
lantic and Pacific seaboards. Among the
western cities near which they would bÂ«
useful are : San Francisco , Los Angelas.
Astoria, Seattle and others. And there
are numerous ports in Cuba and the Phil
ippines which at some future date are
sure to require protection. Though the
submarine boats have !yet to meet oppo
sition of various kinds, and from various
sources, there is a probability that at no
very distant day they may play an Im
portant part in the coast defense* of tho
States. .
, In . making : an attack on ; a battleship
: the^BUbmarine will approach on the sur
face to within about one and a' half .miles
Â¦ and then suddenly plunge and leave noth
ing but a few ripples to indicate where
it had ; gone down. After , running . for " a
mile -beneath 1 the .water, all the .time ap
proaching I the - hull â¢ of } the ' â¢ floating â¢ war

few seconds remain above water. In these
Submarines have yet to be tried in ac
tion, : but it will ; be found that with re
lief crews they .can occupy indefinitely a
position required by an enemy for block
ade or bombardment and ' by moving be
neath, the surface up to the very teeth of
a battleship and dealing ; her a death
blow In the shapeof a torpedo or forcing
her to move^ away, ; thus demonstrate
that the submarine is a craft that neither
gun fire ' nor torpedo | practice | would stop."
Blockades ; and ; bombardments would be
almost impossible with properly manned
submarines in .the- defensive. ' In attack

mining the protecting mines and In enter
ing unseen to destroy ships." drydocks'and
buildings. It may be that such craft will
cross. the ocean some day, for the shape
and ; accouterment of the boats are such
as to make them entirely seaworthy.

in Hteering ; the boat when submerged or
else some method may. be made use of in
obtaining, by means of a-camera-lucida.
a reflected image of the object steered for.
All attempts at lighting- the water ahead
by strong electric arc lights have proved
futile and without taking observations
from the surface for a few seconds when
moving at speed there Is no known way
of steering for an object whose speed and
direction cannot be predicted, as for ln

the discharge of torpedoes. Three tor
pedoes are the equipment of projectiles;'
they . may be eleven feet " eight inches in
length and contain 'hundreds of pounds
of explosive matter. These are the dead
ly things which shooting up from their
hidden quarters beneath the surface and
going true to the mark would often make
the enemy's fleet the less by at least one
fighting ship. *
In the submarine boat there is practi
cally no side to, make her roll in a 'sea
way, and the~ Pike and the Grampus when
in diving trim : in a seaway will not roll
at all, although they are both almost as
round as bottles. It is probable, how
ever, that the crews of . both' vessels will
experience a feeling most unusual, not to
say curiojus, as they slide down the comb
of a sea. The hulls of the boats are built
of steel of great "strength, so tha't the
boat can dive if necessary to a depth of
four hundred feet. ' , It would be possible
to have the craft remain under the water
a week, provided the compressed air -held
out. *It . is not necessary, however," that
the boat should often descend to such a
depth as above mentioned, it being only
necessary to comfortably clear a deep
draught battleship's keel. The . new : ves
sels are . also . provided with > a device for
keeping the boat constantly Â¦' In .diving
The turret or conning/ tower, which
often for a few seconds in a fight makes
a .dark speck on the face of the waves,
is just large , enough to enable a single
man to pass in and out and take observa
tions. ' Here â¢ the captain stands when
above or bejow the surface and steers
the boat, and- not far. away from him is
stationed the man who manages the bal
last tanks and a pair of horizontal diving
rudders at the stern, by^-means of .which
the submersion of the vessel is achieved.
Provision is also made for automatic con
trol of the rudders, for the purpose of
preventing the vessel- from .taking^.ex
cessive angles when diving or coming to
the surface, and also for keeping the boat
submerged at the desired depth. In order
to dive a submarine of practical design
takes in water ballast' until the remain-
Ing buoyancy can be overcome by. the ac
tion of the horizontal rudders; then, the
boat is steered under as she moves ahead.
Above the storage batteries are the se
ries of . air flasks, in which air at . 20C0
pounds to the square inch pressure is
stored for the purpose of keeping pure the
living spaces of the' crew. A supply of
air has not been by any means the hard
est problem -which the inventors of the
submarine boat have had to solve.- It is
a comparatively simple matter to keep in
storage a sufficient quantity of com
pressed air to enable a . number of men
to live aboard a boat without incon
venience for an indefinite period of time.
Safety valves are^ provided to prevent the
pressure in the vessl from exceeding that
of the atmosphere.
therefore be constantly sealed up. She
must be able, moreover, to move ' on the
surface hundreds of miles to a'neicl of ac
tion and be ready for work on arrival.
â¢--â¢'
Consequently all this power, and more,
may be needed when In action, since
while within range of hostile gun fire she
must bo always ready to dive,' and must
The radius will, of course, increase
slightly with decrease of speed, and vice
versa; in other .words, a boat can be kept
in fighting trim at full speed for about
six hours, and at the varying speeds of a
coast defense fight from sunrise ' to sun
set. A boat must draw from her. stored
power from the beginning to the end of an
action. '
The radius of action at the surface Is
about 1000 knots, and the storage bat
teries, which are located above the double
bottom and below the axis of the vessel,
have sufficient capacity for a speed of
eight knots on a five hours' submerged
run. This speed is given by a - 70
horsepower electric motor, which also re
news for the vessel her store of power for
submerged work and makes her radius of
action â i. e., the distance she can move
from a base of supply â an unusually wide
one.
In time of action, in leaving a safe har
bor, the boat would probably- "run light,"
with several feet of the top showing
above the surface of the water until it
should reach the location of the enemy.
Then, with the opening of the valves, the
water would rush into the ballast ccm
partments, and the boat would sink until
simply its small turret would be visible.
The boat Is then in fighting trim. The
masts which the boat carries are for pur
poses of observation only, and are taken
off, along with all- their : exterior ap
paratus, when the boat is in war trim,
and in this condition, in a moderate sea,
It is impossible to observe the vessel at
a distance of even a half-mile. Though
the man of war should finally sight the
boat in one of her few seconds of remain
ing above the water for purposes of ob
servation, and train its guns upon the
spot where the little ocean terror had
been last seen, there would be nothing to
shoot at. The boat has plunged, and at
the very moment is stealing beneath the
water, still closer to her enemy. A score
or more feet of water is more efficient
than any armor plate ever devised. An
unbroken moving stretch , of water pre
sents to the battleship no target.
When the boat is running- on the sur
face the motive power employed consists
of a ICO-horsepower, single-screw, four
cylinder gasoline engine, which is capa
ble of giving the destruction-dealing little
craft a speed of eleven knots. The lines
of the Pike and the Grampus have been
designed so that there shall be a mini
mum of resistance when they are run
ning at the surface. In coming to the
surface to make an observation, the only
part which is visible Is a circular con
ning tower, two feet in diameter, of
heavy armor steel, practically impossible
of penetration. ' '.-"'.'
tion. and is divided by two water-tight
bulkheads into three separate compart
ments. There is also a thorough subdi
vision of the bottom, and every precau
tion is taken to localize any injury to the
hull which might threaten the buoyancy.
The submarine boat has been evolved
after three hundred years of experiment.
During the Revolution, to come to more
modern days, one Bushnell of Connecticut
built and operated a submarine boat that
was a mechanical success, but which
made no impression at the timeâ it was
ahead of the world by a good deal more
than a hundred years. Now the prominent
nations of the world are taking: the sub
marines seriously as Implements of war
fare. France has provided for thirty

sia are at work on them aiW Great Brit
ain, after much conservatism and prej
udice against them, has five in course of
Two of these submarine vesselsâ the
Pike and the Grampus â will soon be
launched from the Union Iron "Works,
Â¦where they are fast nearing completion.
Just at present the boats, looking like
two huge reddish cigars, buried in a mass
of scaffolding, do not suggest their hid
den destructive properties. But even
Â¦when diving in fighting trim the boat
makes one think of nothing" more harm
ful than a porpoise, though In reality it
belongs among the naval sharks. And
like the shark. Its work is quick and
vicious. And like the shark again, it can
remain below the surface long enough to
get far beyond the reach of its pursuers.
THE submarine boat has arrived.
Since the Holland, a submarine
boat built by private parties, was
purchased by the Government after
fulfilling all the requirements that
the Xavy Department laid down, that de
partment has given contracts for six or
seven of these craft, -which will soon be
active and destructive members of our
naval forces.

Such lovely softness as there is in H.his

.Mrs. Belmont's favorite . color is green
and this spring she is wearing' a marvel
ous leaf-green cloth, : trimmed with gold
and black braid. There is a long cloak of
black, trimmed with braid, down each
side of the â- front, and there are [ bell
sleeves, - bordered ! with the brilliant braid.
i Her daughter, j the j Duchess of Marlbor
ough, wears the most' magnificent gowns
ever designed for a woman. This spring,
while she 1s * at the -fashionable French
watering place* with her father, she la
wearing a gown of light gray panne cloth,
so treated that it looks like velvet. . v.
For: the Duchess' of Marlborough.
It Is one of the : gowns she had made
In Paris to take with her to Russia and is
the gown "in which she -made a visit to
the ! Palace and spent three hours
talking, in the most genial social converse,
to the -Czarina, who forgot that she was
the wife of the Czar and. was, for one
afternoon, - Alice of - England; , Alice of the
Highlands, her mother's daughter.
This gown is trimmed with ; panne silk
In the . same color â¢ and with 1 chiffon . in :
light gray, a gown all of llgnt gray. -"Only
a very young, beauty should try >to wear
this pale tone; for: it is trying to age and
brings out the ashiness of the complexion.
â¢ And, by the way, have you heard that
Lady Randolph Churchill, or, as she now
â¢ is, Mrs.' ' Cornwallis ; West, ' made > the first
diplomatic mistake \ of her>social< career.
It was in dress, the very thing. In which
Mrs.' West is most : proficient. By some
bad luck Bhe chose a spring gown of. that
Â¦ new cloth Â¦ which looks exactly like vel
vet; ;but> is as.thinas veiling, and by
, worse \ luck she selected . a shade of rose.
that look like brocaded velvet, but on be
ing squeezed In the hand show the soft
ness of a rose leaf and the toughness of
wood fiber.
Ruffles are so very much worn! You can
ruffle and tuck everything and be sure of
being in style. Wide ruffles, or perhaps it.
would be better to call them accordion
plaitings, are set around the foot of the
summer gowns, . but after one washing
the plaiting is gone and the trimming be
comes an lroned-out ruffle, not the less
becoming and pretty, but less delicate and
dressy.
And it Is an age of delicacy and dressi
ness. The two go so wonderfully hand In
hand. Perhaps there is less of applique
this year than lace, and less of patchy
trimmings, but there is certainly more
pin tucking, and as for plaitings and box
plaitings, ruchings, rufflings and pointed
and graduated flounces, these Quite make
up for the little labor saved In ttia doing
away of applique.
Novel Trimmings.
And applique is not all done away wtth.
If you think so. Just take a walk throtxsrh
the principal stores and notice the ready
made gowns upon which lace flowers are
freely appliqued. Note the passementeries,
partly chenille, partly pearl and partly
silk, all blended in one soft trimming for
dinner gowns. . s .
Notice the squares of wash silk, out
lined by lace, that trim the shirt waists.
Notice the marvelous dlamond-llke appli
cations that seem to trim everything 1 . Yet
the appliqued bit of silk Is not so much
in evidence and lace Is taking Its place.
Waist3 are immense. Women who
boasted a 21-inch waist are wearing a
23, and the few who proudly mentioned
19 as a waist measure now add two to it.
The impossibility of a small waist la
brought about by the straight-fronted cor
set and also by the style of dress. It is
not necessary to compress the waist, and
no woman is doing so. Once released, the
waist swells and the old-fashioned Idea of
trimness is lost, i
The very - light shade* are the ones
sought in the summer gowns. The pastel
pinks are here and the faint blues. Tha
deep blues and pinks and greens and
yellows known as old blue, old pink, ap
ple green and lemon . yellow have been
succeeded by pastel blue, shell pink, aca
cia green and moonstone yellowâ wMcii la
the palest of all blues.
There Is champagne yellow, too, and
garden pink, which is a wry faint tone.
Get' your goods as light as you can. just
so they do not look faded, and you will
come very near to being fashionable.
The New Laces.
The prettiest trimming for all light-hued
goods is lace, and lace this year Is so
beautifully wrought out. It comes so
cheap and so delicate in Imitation Valen
ciennes, imitation Brussels, imitation
point and in the Arabian, Irish and Rus
sian imitations, all so different and all
so cheap and good, that you can surely
be suited.
The very new gowns show a tendency
for the yoke of heavy lace, looking: as
though it were crocheted. Renaissance
lace of the better imitation sort is used
for little bolero jackets and for yoke,
stock and cuffs. And it is also used for
petticoats. One can scarcely get too much
Renaissance lace to look well.
A new fancy has come into play for
braiding the chiffons and ,thln stuffs.
Take a strip of chiffon and cut it In three
lengths. Braid as in a three strand braid.
When done It should make a rope a lit
tle larger than your thumb. *This is used
for the border of a yoke and for the
edge of the neck of a decollete gown.
Lace falls over it for evening and is
caught here and there In the three strand
braid.
If preferred, you can border the yoke
of your street dress with it and use it
again upon your cuffs and at the lower
edge of your, stock. It is an expensive
trimming, but very effective. . - A little
crinoline can. be rolled inside the chiffon
before it Is braided to make a border for
the hat brim. This entire motif can bo
carried nut in shrimp pink for hat. yoke,
belt, cuffs and stock, a very refined finish
to . alL
If you are going to look well this year
you must study your rtre^s, for only in
this way , will you succeed.
. Eternal .vigilance in taste and money
spending Is the price of good dressing ani
you must be . up and must shop late or
the early worm of opportunity In the
shape of pretty bargains will be gone be
fore you have caught it.

LIS WEST'S. DBESS MIS
TAKE.
It is very t^shionable this color, a little
off the pink, and looking more Ilka a faded
rose leaf. They, call it French pink, but
it has. a sad, faded tone.
In this unhappy gown, which was made
entirely of the faded rose color. Mrs.
West attended a reception given by the
I\lrs. Arthur Paget set, and those who
saw her fell back and marveled.
Instead of the fragile brunette loveli
ness which has always been her charac
teristic, they beheld an old woman, with
the pathetic hue of the faded rose in her
cheeks and the wilted look of the very
old rose in her lips. The tints of the rose
gown brought all the pathos of past years
into the comDlevion.
Buying for Summer.
It is time to be out and buying for the
summer gown. You can do so for a very
little. The lovely printed muslins are
very cheap, and' there are figured chif
fons, chiffonettes they are called, that
make lovely trimmings. ! The French
prints are excellent and the Art Nouveau
muslins .quite throw- into the shade the
mercerized goods which held the center of
the stage as an attraction last year and
the year before. , ' - i
" Why no'trget a simple little printed mus
lin and make it up in the way it should
go? You will want a sheath skirt, as
close 'as possible- around the hips, and
as full as an orchid around the foot. Tne
orchid skirt is one of . the new skirts. So
Is the morning glory skirt,- which is ex
tremely full. .
The flounce can be one that is pointed at
the top. It can be cut in great point3 so
that only ten of -them arevneeded to en
compass â¢ the skirt. The bottom hangs
straight and even and is finished by a
hem. . ,
Around the top of the flounce there are
narrow black velvet ribbons run and these
are threaded in and out of a band of in
sertion which â¢ finishes the top of the
flounce. At the top of each point there
comes a little black velvet bow.
The belt need be only a band of inser
tion with narrow black velvet nip.
through it. Two-inch wide Insertion makes
a good belt.
This season so many pretty belts are
made of insertion. The kind that will ac
commodate a ribbon is used and the vel
vet ribbon is run at top and bottom. Any
color may be chosen and the belt is so in
expensive that one can have half a dozen,
one for each suitâ run with ribbon to
match.
A charming way to finish the wrists of
your summer dress is with a ruffle of the
printed muslin. Between ruffle and sleeve
use a strip of Insertion for a cuff and run
two narrow ribbons through it.
A great many summer waists are cut
very low in the neck to set over a yoke
of white lace. This pretty fashion, permits
the leaving off the yoke for evening and
dinner occasions. The only neck finish re
quired for the waist is the little black
velvet . ribbon run through insertion. .
The stock is a simple matter of needle
work with velvet run through. At ona
side of the bust there may be a big chou
of black velvet ribbon. And for the hair
you will need another chou of black vel->
vet to match the one at the bust.
Crisp WhitÂ© Gowns.
' ' Society girls'who dress a great deal and
have a great many gowns are selecting
the crisp materials which are fashionable
this year. These materials give an ap
pearance of youth that qannot be ob
tained from any other kind of stuff.
â¢ They "are crisp and fresh, .young, and
natural looking, quite different from the
clinging, esthetic type, so called, and for
a change very refreshing. Just how they
will stand the wind. and weather y the sea
breezes and the mountain fastnesses, it
will be for summer to disclose. When flr3t
made they are charming..
: Flounces are varied by trimmings of
white satin ribbon. To make a flounce
trimming get a whole pledte of white satin
ribbon, baby width. Take it and tic- it
Into a rosette, or sew it into one if you
be not expert enough to tie it. ~ Let there
be several long loops and no ends. Take
this rosette, which must be as big and as
firm as a white love apple, and fasten it
at the upper edge of the flounce. If de
sired you can place such a rosette at in
tervals all | the way around the skirt, or
you can use three rosettes to trim Â¦ the
front of the skirt, one above the other,
with-six inches between. â¢
The short sleeved girl of summer is cer
tainly here and she will remain and mul
iiply. The sleeve that is chopped off at
the elbow is the sleeve that will be worn
in August. There is nothing difficult
about its making.*: It, is cut oft and fin
ished with a ruffle of the dress material,
that is allâ and very simple it is.
There are fancy ways of making these
short sleeves. ' They can be cut off above
the elbow and completed with a wide
sharp cuff which turns back and stands
out a Louis Quinze cuff. Or the sleeve
can be cut off below the elbow and fin
ished in the same way.
The Summer Sleeve.
A lovely cuff. places the elbow In a bag
.with a cuff below the elbow and the cuff
is finished with hanging lace.
There is one sleeve that is most beauti
ful of all. It is the great klmona sleeve
and it is made out of muslin, lawn, cloth
or â¢ velvet. ; It is large and constantly
grows larger.. From being tight at the
shoulder, if. gradually, widens until It is
perfectly â¢ immense around the hand,
while it shows a beautifully gorgeous lin
ing.. : . Â¦-.
- < The ' outside - of the sleeve is trimmed,
not always with a band of velvet, but
sometimes with straps of insertion, if it
be * a light weight sleave, the straps ex
tending up the arm.f
. A" sleeve is worn beneath this and the
more delicate the under sleeve is the pret
tier. It should be of a soft Loulsine silk,
of beav^tiful hue, and Â« so fine ;. in its tex
ture that it will crumple like a web. yet
shake 'out again without a wrinkle.

To Invade Turkey.
VIENNA. April .12.â The Neue FreJe
Presse to-day publishes a dispatch from
Sofia. Bulgaria, announcing that a procla
mation has been issued by M. Sarafoit,
the 1 Macedonian leader, calling on the
Macedonians in Bulgaria to join In a gen
eral rising April 27. Bands collecting on
the Turkish frontier are to co-operat*
and 'Invade'. Turkey at different colnu.
Such a field was, however, too circumscribed for a man of his ability, and in
1S59 he accepted a call to Syracuse,'. N. Y.,\ where he "remained another three
years. His church was almost always crowded, and; his fame as a. pulpit orator
began to grow widely. In 1862 he became pastor of the Second Reformed Dutch
Church atÂ«PhlIadelphla.. where he reVrialned until -1869, when he had three ' calls,
one from Chicago, one from: San Francisco and one from Brooklyn, i The : latter," '-â¢
from the Central Presbyterian Church of that city, J he/ accepted, at a salary of '.'
$7000 per annum. The church at the time had but'nlneteen members, with "a total
congregation of thirty-five. Talmage, preached his first sermon there In March.V
1869, and then the congregation began 'to. grow. At the end of fifteen' months/' he
induced the trustees to sell the old church and erect a, new. edjflce,; to be known
as the Brooklyn Tabernacle, offering to' give up his salary until the new plan: :
ONE CALL COMES 5 FBOM â¢Â¦- SAN FRANCISCO.
He entered the theological seminary of that church at New Brunswick, N. J.,
and was ordained In 1856. Prior to his ordination -} he .:, had already , received two
calls, one of. which, from a church at Bellville,' N. J.',. he accepted, and remained
Irf the 'charge three years. . ' : Â¦ 1
Young Talmage's preliminary education was obtained at the public schools of
New Brunswick, N. J., and at the age of .13, he -entered the University of New
York. He withdrew, however, before graduating, but received the degree of A. M.
'In 1862. W^hile at the university he,_did not exhibit -any great " brilliancy in his
, studies, but displayed a talent for oratory and a 'dramatic abllitythat made him
a notable figure on exhibition days., -On one occasion, at NIblo's Garden In 1853,
- when he spoke on the "Moral Effects of Sculpture and Architecture," his speech
aroused his audience to a high pitch of enthusiasm,; and was given In 'full Intone
of the New York dally papers, being. the first .of- his productions to be published. ;
On his withdrawal from the university he began the . study of law, but after
three years' work in a law office he/decided that he had made; a mistake in the
choice of a profession, and determined to prepare for ,the ministry! Two /of ; his.
, uncles and three of his brothers were' already preachers of the Gospel, and he "
himself had joined the Reformed Dutch church, 1 to which his family belonged,
when he was 18- years of age. â¢ , . :
. Thomas DeWitt Talmage was born at Bound Brook,- Somerset County, N. J.,
January 7, 1832. â¢ He was the youngest of ,a family of twelve children, seven of
whom were boys. His father, David T. Talmage, was a well to do farmer, whose
marked traits of character were geniality, firmness and decision, all of which the
youngest son In a large measure inherited, with amiability, gentleness and' keen
wit from his mother, combining these with' acute powers of observation, a very
retentive memory and great, bodily vigor. v ," ,
CABEEB OF â¢ THOMAS; DE :, WITT TALMAGK
Dr. Talmage was in poor health when he started away from Washington for
Mexico for a vacation and rest six weeks ago. He was then suffering from influ
enza and serious catarrhal conditions. Since his return to Washington some time
ago he has been quite ill. - Until Thursday, however, fears' for his death were not
entertained. The last rational words uttered by Dr. Talmage were on the day
precedlngthe marriage of his daughter, when he said, ."Of course, I know you,
Maud." 'Since then he had been unconscious.'. At Dr. Talmage's bedside, besides
his wife, were these members of his family: Rev. Frank DeWitt Talmage, Chi- -
cago; Mrs. Warren G. Smith, Brooklyn: Mrs., Daniel Mangum, Brooklyn; Mrs. v
Allen E.-Donriau, Richmond, and'^Mrs. Clara Wlckoff and Miss Talmage, Wash-,
ington. While arrangements for*' the 'funeral' have not been finally complete, the
family have about decided to have the remains .taken to the Church of the Cove
nant here on Tuesday,-. where services will be held. The body will then be conveyed
to Brooklyn, where Interment will be made in the farrilly plat in Greenwood'Ceme

LONDON. April 12.â The so-called meat
famine which has been exploited through
out the British . press ha3 become a mat
ter, of kÂ«en Interest to Londoners, who
hitherto . have not been affected by the
prevailing scarcity. A careful canvass of
London shows that the retailers at the
present time are the sole sufferers by the
advance In the wholesale price, which
amounts .to a penny" per pound on nil
grades of meat. Since January the major
ity of the retailers have been running
their business without profit, because lack
of organization prevented a uniform in
crease of -prices. A meeting, however,
has been called, whjch will undoubtedly
result in a uniform Increase In the price
of 'meat on the part of retailers through
out London. y^SSBEDH
BRITISH MEAT FAMINE.
It was said to-day that just as certain
as it can be proved that there has been
an agreement between Armour, Morris
and other packers as to prices all over
the country and as to an apportionment
of territory, Just so certain will the Gov- ;
ernment proceed to break up the combi
nation. This Is supposed to be the case
the Attorney General Is seeking to estab
lish.
In addition to these elaborate argu
ments others were made to show the bigr
Republican politicians that the price of
beef was raised not simuly for the pur
pose - of making big profits, but because
of the scarcity of beef cattle. in the West
and the high price of corn. This did not
deter the . administration from having
proper steps taken for the establishment
of the facts whether the anti-trust law
was being violated, whether the public
was suffering in consequence and whether
competition had been crushed.
But agents of the trust, it i3 said, went
even â¢ further than that and called atten
tion to the fact that they had been the
best friends of the Republican party In
the West, and whenever hundreds of
national .or congressional committee*
needed replenishment they always came
forward with generous- contributions.
Therefore they were entitled to protec
tion and they should not be singled out
for attack when dozens of other tru3tÂ»
and combinations were engaged in doing
the same thing.
AGENTS ABE ACTIVE.
"Let it sleep," was the argument. "It
is an awkward question, and what differ
ence does it make even if the people are
paying a higher price for their meats so
long as they are making higher wages
than they ever made before?"
.'. But just here the same influences that
always make themselves heard when the
question of trusts comes up in the Re
publican party appeared on the scene.
Representatives of the big butchers and
packers themselves came to Washington
soon after agitation began against the
beef trust. Representatives of the beef
trust came to. Washington two weeks
ago. These thrifty and practical gentle
men - wanted ' the administration to hold
Its hands, and took the ground that there
had been no violation of the law on their
part. This brought up the question as to
what. they had to fear if there had been
no violation of the law. This was a puz
zler, but the matter took a different turn,
it is reported, and an effort was made by
the beef men as soon as they recovered
from . their ; embarrassment to show that
if the beef matter was forced by proceed
ings it would open up the whole question
of ' combinations.
The President has had his* attention
called to the ma'tter repeatedly and ha
has never had the slightest hesitation as
to what should be done. He has felt that
if the people were being oppressed by ex
tortion and that a monopoly was being
created by this gigantic combination f cr
the purpose of restraining trade and rais
ing prices, then the legal machinery - of
the United States should be put in opera
tion to stop these practices, and if neces
sary to close the packing houses.

can make the positive statment that the
Department of Justice has been moving
against the beef trust. It is useless to

One of the curious features of the pres

representatives secured a legal training

The repeated rumors of Joseph Cham
berlain's resignation of the office of Colo
nial Secretary, which were received after
the publication of hfÂ« slgne<J denial, may
be utterly disregarded. They rise out of
serious differences existing between him
self and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
ever the West Indies and other colonial
matters requiring treasury co-operation,
which have frequently been mentioned in
these dispatches and which appear to be
more acute than they have been for '
months.
It was ascertained Jate to-night that

ranged for to-morrow afternoon.

sums up the present crop of rumors, con

the eye in glaring posters of newspapers
and the question is re-ecnoed throughout

at midnight by Balfour. the Government
leader in the House of Commons, the re
ports of the definite end of a conflict of
such length, involving so many lasting
and intricate issues, being reached prac
tically without any time oeing devoted to
negotiations are palpably premature.
It is announced that the Ministers at
to-day's meeting, which lasted an hour,
discussed a communication from Lord
Kitchener. This is quite within reason.
and Government circles pxpect several
similar messages from Lord Kitchener be
fore anything definite can be announced.
While Lord Kitchener's message* may
have been of vital importance the Asso
ciated Press has good reasons to believe
that the sudden summons of the Cabinet
Ministers was due to a ceslre to decide
whether or not the presentation of the
budget could be postponed until the
Klerlrsdorp negotiations are settled one
â¢way or the other.
REVIEWED BY CABINET.
Whatever the proposals of the Chancel
lor of the Exchequer. Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach, may be, they are bound to be
greeted by storms of criticism from vari
ous quarters. Peace will not modify the
crying need. of additional revenue, -but it
would take off the sting from the ad
ditional taxation, which is bound to raise
a protest from every class of industry af
fected, la the national Jubilation over
the end of the war these industrial pro
tests will be lost to sight.
It "will be no surprise if it is announced
; on Monday that the budget presentation
cnee more has been postponed, and "if this
. does not take place Parliamentary circles
will regard it as one of the best amens
that the Government practically is as
sured of a successful termination of the
Klerksdorp conference.
The Cabinet council to-day, while it
probably did riot fulfill the sensationally
attributed function of deciding between
peace or war. undoubtedly reviewed the
entire situation, both as regards some
finance and the situation in South Africa,
How complicated and impossible of off
hand solution is tne latter question can be
judged by an apparently authentic state
ment published in the Edinburgh News
this afternoon.
The News, whose editor is in daily
touch with Mr. Kruger, says:
The Boers will not make absolute independ

MINNEAPOLIS, April 12.â About 60 per
cent of the flour mill capacity of this city
will be idle next week and for an indefin
ite time thereafter until conditions Im
prove. This means loss of their time to
about 1000 mill employes.
The shutdown is due partly to the pre
mium millers have^o pay on May wheat,
but principally because of the discrimina
tory rates on wheat and flour in favor of
wheat. This discrimination is even now
the -subject of .'.negotiation- between the
millers and the railroads, and although
the Western roads are willing to equalize
the rates the Eastern roads have so far
declined to do, so. The consequence is
that the export demand for flour has fall
en, it being more profitable to ship the
wheat and grind it abroad. The roads
maintain that flour is more expensive to
handle than wheat and that the rate must
therefore be higher. â¢ ThÂ«S millers claim to
be able to explode this theory entirely

Article on Christ Completed.
WASHINGTON,. April 12.-The Presby

one article on the life and work of Christ,
after a long discussion which developed
at times much difference" of opinion. The
article was- finally framed so as to meet
the unanimous consent of the committee.
Mrs. Miller, his wife, who has been an
Invalid for several years, is prostrated at
her home and is in a dangerous condition.
In sentencing Miller, Judge Murphy
called him a demon and said that he con- Â¦'
sidered that the sentence tie was about to
impose on him was inadequate for his hor
rible crime.' Miller was taken back to
jail, where he remained until he left for
the station. Accompanied by two officers
he went to Jackson, at 8:20 o'clock,: over
the Michigan Central Railroad.
Evidence was then introduced to prove
the death of Miss Jennett. At its conclu
sion Miller's attorney, E. C. Chamberlain,
addressed the court. He congratulated the
Police Department on their efficient work
in running down the murderer and secur
ing his confession, and I said that he had
no sympathy with Miller, who deserved
the extreme penalty of the law. .

On his return home in 1890 the new tabernacle not being completed, Dr. Tal
.mage-diyided bis .time on; Sundays between New York and Brooklyn,- preach
ing, at the Academy of Music in each city. The* new structure was ready' for.
the Easter service, in 1891, and it is said that the grandest sermon of hi3 life
was preached by Dr. Talmage on that occasion. .
In 1894 Dr. Talmage left Â¦ Brooklyn and took up his residence in Washing
ton, where he lived until his death. No preacher of his time has been more
widely heard and read than Dr. Talmage. Besides the vast congregations
that flocked to hear him wherever he preached or lectured at home or abroad,
his "sermons "were published every wedk," without a single* exception; for twenty
nine years, in a number of the leading papers of the United States, and later,
through syndicates, were published In 3600 different papers, reaching on an esti
mate thirty millions of readers in this and. other lands every week, j These ser
mons were translated into most European and many Asiatic languages. .
Dr. Talmage made his first appearance on the lecture platform during his
stay in Philadelphia, and thereafter was always in demand, lecturing in nearly
every city, of any size in the United States during his vacations, and earning
thereby quite, a, fortune. Many of his lectures and addresses were published in
the ' magazines. He .was the author of a number of works, mostly of a re
ligious character, the most important of which were "Crumbs Swept Up" (1870);
"Abominations of Modern Society" (1872); "Old Wells Dug Out" (1874) ; "Sports
That Kill" - (1875) ; "Night Sides of City Life" (1878); "The Marriage Ring"
(1836); "Woman, Her Powers and Privileges"; "From Manger to Throne"; "The
Earth Girdled"; "Every Day Religion"; "Fishing Too Near the Shore," etc.
More than fifty, books, were published under his name, and the majority were
pirated and unauthorized by him.
Â» Dr. Talmage published also two sets of sermons, one of four volumes 0872
75) and another of 104 sermons, 'entitled "The Brooklyn Tabernacle." He also
edited the Christian at .Work (1873-76), Advance (1877-78) and Frank Leslie's Sunday
Magazine, and after goings to Washington, '- The Christian Herald. - â¢ ...
Â¦ In 1884 the degree of Doctor of Divinity was ! conferred upon Talmage bv the
University of - Tennessee, ; an honor which : strange to say had been withheld by
institutions, nearer to the scene of his work and triumphs, , though they were not
as a rule so discriminating' in- the bestowal of such honors.
Dr. Talmage was twice married. His first wife, by \ whom he had two chil
dren, a boy and a girl, was a Miss Avery of Brooklyn, who was drowned by ac
cident in , the Schuylkill Riverr Two years later he married Miss Susan C. Witte
more, also of Brooklyn, by whom he had several children.
MOST WIDELY BEAD PREACHER OP HIS TIME.
In 18S9, just as Dr.. Talmage was about to start on a trip .to Palestine and
the East, the second tabernacle was destroyed by fire. On the insistence of the
trustees and assurance that the -disaster would be. speedily repaired he went on.
his Journey. After, an enthusiastic reception In London he went on to Athens
and the Holy Land, becoming enthused as , he traversed the memorable places,
and sending home brilliant descriptions of what he saw and the thoughts in
spired thereby. These letters were copied, all over the country.
A debt of $72,500 rested on the church, and calling to his assistance . ah indi
vidual known as the "great church debt raiser" Talmage undertook to lift the
debt. Putting down his own name for" $5000, ' he obtained the first day $42,000, and
the rest soon after bv, private subscription. In October, 1878, bis salary was raised
from $7000 to $12,000. .â¢; - - '\
proved a success. The Tabernacle was begun In 1870, and while It was in course
of. erection Talmage made his first visit to Europe. The Tabernacle was Jn the
form of a horseshoe inclosing a half-acre of ground, and was generally crowded.
When, on Sunday. December 22, 1872, it was destroyed by fire Talmage preached
,to i audiences at the Academy of Music: His great popularity soon secured the
guarantees for another and a better structure than the old one.
- In June, 1874, the new Tabernacle, on Schermerhorn street, was formally opened
with. 4650, people in the regular seats and as many more In the aisles and stand
ing. In his new Tabernacle Talmage's individuality qf. manner and. phrase more
prominently manifested itself, his dramatic style and peculiar methoas of driving
home the forcible words Of his sermon giving rather a theatrical character to his
preaching. It took with the people, however, and late comers to his services
rarely found even standing room. He succeeded, however, in holding a large and
earnest congregation together and interesting them in practical religious work.
Talmage in the first Tabernacle, , in the face of much opposition and predictions or
disaster, had made the innovation of abolishing the choir and estaDlishlng con
gregational singing under the leadership of a precentor, and it was a grand suc
cess.' ;..,''. . ' â¢ Â¦ Â¦ ' ' â¢ '. -"Â¦Â¦ .'â¢'â¢ Â¦"' " - "Â¦ ' -.

Radio Pass Water Very Often Day and Night,
Cured by the Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp-Rooty
DR. KILMER & CO.. Binghamton, N. T. -; .
About two years ago I had a very severe case of kidney and ' bladder : trouble.
The pain in the small of my back was so severe that I could not stand, it .to stay
ia one position more than a moment or two. and was obliged to pass water very
often day and night. I tried medicines and doctors without getting; relief . Noticing
an advertisement in the Topeka State Journal of Swamp-Root, r determined to"-
give it a trial, and bought a bottle. By the time I had finished the first bottle tha ;
pain had entirely disappeared from my back. The pain and frequent desire to
pass water ceased. However, I continued to take the medicine, using about six
bottles in all. That was over a year ago, and I have had no return of the trouble
since. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦.Â¦-:Â¦Â¦ . -Â¦. ; " â¢

SACRAMENTO, April 12.â One of the
most Â¦ charming of the maids of honor
sent by sister cities to attend the May
queen of the Sacramento Street Fair last
year was Miss Lottie Lee Lytle of Santa
Rosa.' 1 She was bright of face and petite
of ' flgure,' and attired j in her fluffy skirts
and dainty furbelows she. quite captivated
Edward Alexander, a young law student,
iwho.had come to the festival as escort of
his sister, Miss Gertrude, the- pretty maid
of honor, from Colusa. . -. .
One evening during 'a social function at
which the ''maids of honor* were present
young Alexander remarked in the hearing
of several of . the maids . that Miss Lytle
was the prettiest girl . of the entire seven
teen constituting v the! court of .] Queen
Edith. -Mrs. William Beckman," wife of
the former : Railroad Commissioner from;
this district and a -society leader of this
city, consented to arrange; a meeting be
tween the " young coupie; One evening
during the carnival, in the parlors of the
Golden Eagle Hotel* ' the winsome maid
of honor from Santa Rosa and her ardent
admirer were formally introduced. In thÂ«s
latter 'part ."of the, same week. Miss- Lytle
promised . to ! become . the I wife of young
Alexander," and -their- marriage occurred
in San, Francisco on May 29. '
The lights of the ' carnival ; burned out,
and as the memories of the brilliant week
became yellow and sere the love of the
young couple must ..have faded. " At any
rate, a year had not elapsed before Santa
Kosa's fair maid of honor was a plaintiff
in a a divorce -> suit brought before ? Judge
Peter J. Shields â¢ of this county, in which
she charged her j young lawyer-husband
with extreme cruelty. Alexander did not
make his appearance In court, although
he filed a general denial of the charges. -â¢
Judge Shields i heard the evidence and
granted a decreÂ« which separated the young
woman from the young lawyer who less
than- a year ago^had considered her the
prettiest Â¦ girl in -seventeen cities. The
plaintiff was allowed to'resume'her.maid
en name.; ;She is now : employed in a de
partment store, in this city. ..-

case reported "from" BladfcsT in Yolo Coun

prospects of a fortune for the 'man of her
choice, with . the full knowledge that she
is renouncing all for him. : .: >
Miss Martha Hershey, who has passed
her twentieth birthday, is the daughter
of David N. Hershey, "capitalist. Her
father owns . several j farms in Yolo â¢ and
much property In .Woodland, where he di
rects a, bank.'.* His wealth is estimated at
upward of $1,000,000. He has two sprightly
daughters, Martha being the youngest.
The girls are highly educated and accom
plished."'
No cloud appeared to darken the old
capitalist's home until Herman "Walker,
a man of 45 years, ; who owns a. small
neighboring farm.became a frequent vis
itor and finally asked for the hand" of
Miss Martha. David Hershey voiced his
wrath, and his'daughter proudly declared
her love for Walker. The latter was or
dered from. the, place.
Two days ago, during the father's tem
porary absence, Miss Martha Hershey de
cided the question- finally for . herself.
Upon his return Hershey a, tear
stained note from his daughter, saying
that she had eloped with Walker and was
proua to give up everything for his sake.
It is learned that Â« the couple | procured
a marriage license in Sacramento. They
have' not returned, and those who know
the young lady say that any overtures
must come.from-the father- himself. .- ' Â¦

To tnmk about
Are you in the market for floor coverings ? Here's some-
thing to think about.
The Breuner Carpet Store is THE big, emphatic triumph
of a business that has been notable for quick success ? s. Opened
4 March, 1901, it is now only a little over twelve months old.
Yet the representatives of the big Eastern mills tell us that we
are selling more carpet to-day than any other store on the
coast.
We have but one price to everybody. It is based on the
closest possible margin of profit upon which a safe business
can be conducted. Lower prices than ours are sometimes
quoted â in the newspapers. But investigation â comparison
of values â is all we ask in such cases. The lowest price is
sometimes the highest â if substantial quality is not back of it.
We are building this business for a long, rosy future.
We want your trade not alone for to-morrow, but for next
Â¦week, next month and for the years to come. We cannot
afford to mislead, to misrepresent or to take advantage of you.

bits the yard. Axminsters, one dollar. Velvets, one dollar.

In opposition to some points of the bill,
Gallinger of New Hampshire said the au
thor of the pending measure would not
know the creature of his brain after It
had passed through the ordeal which was
awaiting it in the Senate.
"What on earth," he Inquired, "are the
supporters of the bill making this hulla
baloo about, any way?"
Teller of Colorado said It was the wish
of the advocates of the measure to ex
clude absolutely Chinese laborers, and he
believed it could not be done except by
some drastic measure such aa that under
consideration. He criticized the Chinese
Minister for "Interfering" with pending
legislation. "It never had been done ln
this country," he said, "and ' nothing in
the treaty can be tortured into an excuse
for such an act. No self-respecting na
tion, ever has permitted such an Inter
ference ln its affairs.". .He challenged any
Senator to point to a precedent for such
an act. Â¦
, Spooner of Wisconsin, interrupting, with
a emlle said, "I accept the challenge."
"I have no desire," replied Teller, "to
fight a duel with the Senator."
my memory, does not betray me,"
continued Senator Spooner, "during the
considaration of the Dingley tariff bill
some of the representatives of foreign
governments protested against the enact
ment of certain of Its provisions."
Dryden of New Jersey explained briefly
that as a member of the Immigration
Committee he was opposed to several pro
visions of the bill, particularly that pro
viding that American vessels could not
employ. Chinese seamen.
Patterson of Colorado presented resolu
tions adopted bv seafaring men ln New
York, Philadelphia and San Francisco m
support of the pending bill, and urirlnir
that they could do the work on Oriental
trading shipa despite the heat.
The Senate at 4:05 p. m. went into ex
ecutive session, and at 4:15 p. m. atl-
In conclusion Lodge made a' general
argument against the admission of the
Chinese and against unrestricted immi
gration generally. In the presence . of
Mongolian labor our own labor would per
ish, and he hoped the Senate would get
out of the pending bill the best legisla
tion possible to meet this great question.
Frye of Maine explained that as presi
dent pro tern, tie frequently received dis
patches and letters bearing upon legis
lation proposed. He had received some
concerning the pending bill and he read
several dispatches from business men of
San Francisco expressing the hope that
the pending bill would not pass because It
was too drastic In its provisions; because
it would interfere with our trade with.
China, and insisting upon the re-enact
ment of the Geary act, which, they said,
would protect amply American interests
and American labor.
Speaking of the provision in the bill re
lating to the employment of Chinese on
American chips, Frye referred to what he
called "a spectacular performance" the
other day between the Senator from In
diana (Fairbanks) and the Senator from
California (Perkins). Senator Fairbanks
took exception to Frye' a reference and
eaid somewhat warmly: "It seemed a
'spectacular performance' to only the
Senator from Maine."
"I doubt it," insisted Frye. "It seemed
so to many Senators." ' .
The very legislation now on the statute
books was in a measure a violation of
our treaty with China, as It was enacted
before ,the treaty of 1894 was negotiated.
The pending measure, he maintained, was
not ln contravention of the treaty of 1894,
which provided that Chinese laborers
should be excluded. Â«
Hanna of Ohio Interrupted to read a
telegram from the president of the Mer
chant's. Exchange and the president of
the Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
cisco and several other prominent San
Francisco business men urging the re
enactment of the Geary act because It
would protect fully American labor and
doubtless would add to the tradÂ© of the
United States.
He urged that there were not enough
American seamen pn the Pacific Coast to
meet the requirements of the bill and he
pointed out that the provision ln the
measure would operate to the disadvan
tage of the country. He maintained that
the operation of the pending bill would
not disturb our trade relations with
China. He was firmly devoted to the
sanctity of the treaties of this country
and knowingly would not vote to violate
any treaty, certainly not any treaty with
China. . - -â¢ v
Lodge of Massachusetts delivered a
speech in support of the pending bill, al
though he antagonized that provision
which prevented American ships from
employing Chinese seamen. He vigorous
ly urged the enactment of the measure
with the modifications . he suggested,
maintaining that Congress should place
permanent and not merely tentative legis
lation on the statute books.
Foraker of Ohio and Hoar of Massachu
setts insisted "that the Chinese Minister
had done no more than his duty and that
he would have been derelict of his duty
Iiad he done less.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â A feature of
the Chinese exclusion debate in the Sen
ate to-day was the sharp criticism, | of
Minister .Wu of China because of his pro
test made to the Secretary of State
against the enactment of the pending bill.
Mitchell of Oregon and Teller of Colorado
sharply attacked him, declaring that he
deserved to have been given his passports,
and that no self-respecting nation would
have permitted such interference in its
legislative affairs.

Celebrated Hypnotist How.- -Distrib-
uting Fifty Thousand Copies ol^
a Wonderful Free Book.
SECRETS AND MYSTERIES EX-
POSED.
The Professor Tells How All May
Learn His Strange and
Magic Art.
I am at present giving away an eleganf
illustrated book on the subject of Hypno-
tism. It Is absolutely free to anybody and
everybody who may read this article. It
is the most beautiful. Interesting and val-
uable book ever published. Those who
glance at a single page of It ara spell-
bound by the subject and would gladly;
read It to the end. If possible, at one sit-
ting-. From long. years, of study and ex-
periment I know this realm of Hypnotism
In all Its branches ar>d extent. I am aa
adept and acknowledged authority on its
methods, mysteries . and uses. From : my
vast experience as demonstrator and
teacher I can also Impart this knowledge
to others In a pleasing way. Aa you react
nay charming book, so do you 'master my
subject. Every wonderful feature of tho
science Is exposed with, crystal clearness.
I begin by showing you what Hypnotism)
really Is â the nature of the trance-like
? condition Into which ono mind can cast
others, and by the control of their wllla
and faculties attain the most varied and
surprising results. It is hereby you are
enabled to exercise, ln such ways aa I
fully direct you, all the strange and,
MAGIC POWERS OF HYPUTOTISBE.
Here you get the true secrets of Personal
Magnetism, which makes a Napoleon the
Idol of armies and a Beecher or Wendell
Phillips the charm of listening multitudes.
Here, also, you find the solution not only
of bygone sorcery and necromancy, but
of those modern mental phenomena ln
Clairvoyance Mind Reading. Telepathy
and other exhibits that bewilder the most
Intelligent observers. But the veil of mys-
tery drops away from them all to those
who study my free book. They become to
you practical arts instead of themes for
mere speculation and surprise. Thus do I
likewise unfold to you the wonderful
power of suggestion, hypnotic and post-
hypnotic, which is proving itself the con-
queror and healer of all forms of disease,
of pains and aches, of evil hablt3 and
moral perversities. The use you can make
of Hypnotism for the relief of suffering
humanity is one that must commend itself
to every sympathetic heart. The parent
who has a wayward child, the wife who
has a dissipated husband, the teacher who
has to deal with a slothful or refractory
pupil, the nurse or relative who has to
manage a fretful invalid, all these and
many more are furnished with a helper
In Hypnotism, that will immediately take
up the burden of their anxieties. Above
all. do these powers Invoke our gratitude

SPECIAL BOON" TO THE SICKT
They who grasp the secret of Hypnotism
can heal themselves as well as others. No
longer need the sick man worry himself
Into despair. No longer may It be said of
the invalid that nothing seems to help
him. All these downcast and suffering
ones become their own doctors, self -treat-
ing, self-sufficing and self-curing, by
methods which are more potent and cer-
tain than any medical system ever yet
known. Nor is this any more than ono
department of its powers.
FOR YOUR PERSONAL GAIN".
My book will show you in the most ex-
plicit way how a scholar may advance In
his studies, how a cleric or salesman can
win favor or promotion, how a business
man may gain custom and extend his
trade, how anybody of either sex can win
the love or esteem they prize above>all
the world or whatever standing ln society;
may be the object of their secret ambi-
tion. I even teach you how Hypnotism
can solve the rude problem of domeatla
infelicity, thus insuring harmony and *X-Â»
fectlon ln the home, and giving the lasft
finishing touch to a life of
HEALTH, PRO SPERITY AND CGNW
TENT. j
Nor do I neglect the more playful ajuK
recreative needs of life. I show you tnv
this wonderful book how you can make 1
hypnotism a source of side-splitting ran
ana amusement either hi the home circlet
or for a public audience. In this sense Ii
has never been equaled by any other en-Â»
tertainment known to the comic stage.
And here I open up to you the. way to>
make Hypnotism a calling or profession
that will bring you Income, reputation
and social eminenceâ even far- ex tending
celebrityâ if you choose to aspire to It. In-
deed. If I were to give you a fortune in
money or an estate of broad lands, t
would not be giving you grander oppor-
tunities for happiness than you may gafc*
by the Btudy of
MY BEAUTLfa'Uli FREE BOOS.
And truly beautiful It Is, I can assure^
you. I have spared neither time, toil no?
expense to make It ln every way worthy?
of this noble science, worthy of my own
professional renown, and worthy of the
new century on which Hypnotism smllea
with such glorious promise. I have dis-
cussed my subject In easy and familiar
Btyle, so that the simplest intelligence can
grasp every statement. I have had my
book illustrated, with pictures on every
page, showing to the very life what could
not be adequately told in words, and
above all ' depicting vividly the sensa-
tional and funny performances that* are
m-oduced by Hypnotism on the stage.
These pictures are by the best American
artist3. and If you only approached this
subject from mere curiosity, still they
.would gratify you in a high degree. The
cover design of my book Is also an ex-
tremely elegant symbolic design, the work
of an able artist, whose sympathies make
him also a devotee of this science. Even
the printing of my book has been attend-
ed to as a vital feature, a new and clear
type having been expressly cast for it so
as to make it the pleasanter and easier
reading. In fact .

Â¦Where&s, All the departments of the mu
nicipality are asking (no doubt Justly) for an
increased appropriation of funds to carry on
the business of their several offices during
the fiscal year of 1902 and 1903; and whereas,
the need of a new County Hospital and many
new Echoolhouses is an immediate one: and
whereas, two of the political' parties having
representatives in power have by their party
platforms pledged themselves to the dollar
limit and to net aside 10 cents of each dollar
raised by taxation for a permanent improve
ment fund; and whereas, it is apparent that
it would hamper the affairs of the munlclpaiity
by their living up to this pledge. Therefore

at the home of 'Mrs. C. Elwood Brown,
3201 Pacific avenue, having been invited to I
meet the officers, managers and organiz
ers of the National Society of Colonial
Dames of America, resident m California.
All these firms, which control practical
ly the harness making industry of the
coast, have united in a resistance to the
demands of the striking workers. The
demand of the leather workers Is for a
nine-hour work day -at the same rate of
wages as at present obtains. Practically
this amounts to an increase of 10 per
cent in wages. The proprietors of the va
rious places are united in opposition to
this move. They claim that in view of
Eastern competition and convict-made
goods they cannot compete with the pres
ent low rates obtaining In this city.
The men claim that the piece work sys
tem, now in vogue, prevents them from
earning a livelihood. The demands of the
leather-workers have been rejected by the
members of the Wholesale Saddlers' Asso
ciation of the Pacinc Coast, which is prac
tically comprised of the firms named and
others located In Portland and Seattle.
About 150 men employed in the harness
making shops of this city went out on
strike yesterday afternoon when they
ended the work for the day. The shops
affected are those of J. C. Johnson & Co.,
Main & Winchester, L. D. Stone, W. Da
vis & Sen and A. A. Van Voorhies of Sac
ramento.

Z.dkin. office Â£32 K, Rochester. N T
N'ot long ago John Adams of Blakes-
bury. la,, who had been lame for twenty
ypzrs, was permanently cured by Profes-
sor Adkin without an operation of any
Kind. About the same time the city of
Rochester. N". T.. was startled by the cure
of one of its oldest residents. Mr. P A.
"U'ripht. who hart beer, partly blind for
a long period. John B. Neff of Millers-
nurph, Pa., who had suffered for years
from a cataract over his left eye. was
BpeedQjr restored to perfect sight without
on operation. From Logransport. Tnd.,
r Â°nes the news of the recovery of Mrs
Mary Eicher, who had been practically
nr&t for a year, while In Warren. Pa,. Mr.
O. W. Savage, a noted photographer and
artist who was not only partially blind
and deaf, but at death's door from a com-
plication of diseftses. was restored to per-
fect health and strength by Professor
-A<5kin. Â¦â¢ .- . . Â¦Â¦;,
So gTeat Is the sensation wro-ught In the
medical world by the wonderful cures per-
formed by Prof. Adkin that several pro-
fessional gentlemen were asked to inves-
tigate the cures. Among these gentlemen
were Dr. L. B. Hawley and Dr. L. G.
Doane, both famous physicians . and sur-
ceons. After a thorough and painstak-
ing investigation these eminent physicians
were so astounded at the far-reaching
power* Prof. Adkin and the wonderful
efficacy of Vitaopathy- that they volun-
teered to forsake all other ties In life and
all other kinds of treatment and devote
themselves to assisting Prof. Adkin In
his great work for humanity. With the
discovery of the Adkin Vitaopathic treat-
ment eminent physicians are generally
agreed that the treatment of disease has
Â«.t last been reduced to an exact science.
In all Eome 8000 men and women have
been cured by the powers of Prof. Adkin.'
Eome were blind, some were lame, some
Â¦were deaf, some were paralytics, scarcely
able to move, so gTeat was their Infirmity.
Others were afflicted with Bright's, dis-
ease, heart disease, consumption and
other po-called incurable diseases. Some
â¢were sufferers from kidney trouble, dys-
pepsia, nervous debility, insomnia, neu-
ralgia, constipation, rheumatism, female
troubles and other similar ills. Some
were men and women addicted to drunk-
f nnÂ«s<=. morphine and other evil habits. In
ell cases Prof. Adkin treats he guaran-
tors a cure. Even those on the brink of
the grave, with all hope of recovery gone
and despaired of by doctors and friends
alike, have been restored to perfect
health by the force of Vitaopathy and
Prof. Adkin's marvelous skill. And, re-
markable as it may seem, distance has
made no difference. Those living far away
have been cured in the privacy of their
own homes, as wejl as those who have
been treated in person. Prof. Adkin as-
sorts that he can cure anv one at any dis-
tance as -well as though he stood be-
fore them.
â¢ In all parts of the country men and
women, doctors and surgeons, clergymen
tad educators, are wondering at the re-
markable cures made by Prol. Thomas F.
A-dkln, discoverer of the Adkin Vitao-
patiiic treatment.
ProC Adkin heals not by drugs, nor by
Christian Science, nor by Osteopathy, nor
by Hypnotism, nor by Divine healing:, but
by a subtle psvchlc form of nature in
combination with certain vital magnetic
remedies which contain the very elements
of life and health.
A reporter recently talked with Prof.
Adkin and was asked to invite all readers
of this paper who are sick or who are
worried by the ills of those dear to them
to write to him for assistance. "Some
people have declared," said Prof. Adkin,
r 'that my powers are of God; they call
Be a Divine healer, a man of mysterious
powers. This is not so. I cure because I
understand nature, because I use the sub-
tle force of nature to build up the system
tnd restore health. But at the same time
1 believe that the Creator -would not have
given me the opportunity to make the dis-
coveries I have made or the ability to de-
velop them if He had not Intended that I
should use them for the good of human-
ity. I therefore feel that It is my duty to
give the benefit of the science I practice
to all who are suffering. I want you to
tell your readers that they can write to
me in the strictest confidence If they are
troubled with* any kind of disease, and I
will thoroughly diagnose their cases and
prescribe a simple home treatment -which
l positively guarantee to effect a complete
cure, absolutely free of charge. I caxe
not how serious their cases, nor how
hopeless they may seem, I want them to
write to me and let me make them well.
I feel that this is my life's work."

sophomores solely, and their opinion was
shared by the seniors. Accordingly a

The scene of the robbery was what !s
known as Piccardoville," on the Jackson
Gate road. It is believed that this same
robber Â¦ planned to rob VWells-Fargo's of
fice the evening before. "Agent Wilfred
Knnis was aroused . late at night by ja
pounding on the rear door of the office.
Buspecting that it was a ruse to get him
to thp door, he took the precaution to
telephone for, help,- but when assistance
arrived there was no one around. There
v as about $20,000 in the office that even
ing, the coin having . been shipped there
for . the purpose of paying off the em
ployes of the Oneida mine.
STOCKTON, April 12.â Near Jackson,
Amador County, early last evening, a
masked man, with a revolver in each
hand, entered the wholesale liquor store of
A. Ficcardo and demanded the 'money in
the safe. Piccardo, his son Louis and six
other men were ' in the place. The man
with the revolvers took them so com
pletely by surprise that they were unable
to recover their wits. Six men made haste
to get into the cellar, Louis Piccardo hid
in tne office and the elder Piccardo faced
the robber alone. The invader demanded
that he open the safe. Piccardo declared
that the keys were at home. The high
wayman then ordered him to turn his
pockets out and to deliver up the money
in the till. About $30 waa handed to him.
The man then backed out of the place.
Just as the robber reached the door
Louis Piccardo recovered . his nerve suf
ficiently to grasp a double-barreled shot
gun and fire both charges at the retreat
ing man. The shot did not take effect,
evidently,' but the robber stumbled and
fell to the ground. The six other men got
out of the cellar and started after the
fellow, but in the darkness he managed to
elude them.- He left his 'hat and one pis
tol near where - he fell. It was so dark
that pursuit was unavailing.

Varicocele.
J.. fr ?P an:y wwcr. and even Iif4
1 i^ lf by allowir -S ths disorder to re-
9 " acure J 1 - Varicocele results from
a partial iiaraSysla of the delicate nerve
I nbers that have a part In controllins
i local circulation of the blood, Thi
S muscular coatlnsr of the veins, beinx
J cej.nved of nervous communication and
â¢ control, become Inactive, weaken anJ
g reUx. The blood vessels expand from
Ithe pressure within, the circulation Â¦ ia
the parts becomes slus^lsh, and fre-
quently stagnant pools form in little
nooks and pockets that constantly en-
large as the relaxation continues. The
possibility exist* that clots may form
in these stagnant pools and then pass
o"t ,J n to the general circulation.
Should one find lodgment in a valve
of the heart the result might be in-
stant death, or should it be carried to
the brain, general paralysis would fol-
low.
I ruarantee to cure varicocele in one
week by a method that involves no
cutting-, no ligature, no caustic. Xo
H other physician employs a like method,
[1 ana so thorough is my work that there
I need .not be the sliehtest fear of a ;
j relapse into the old condition. ThcsÂ»
3 who nave been Ions afflicted wit 1 *
3 varicocele will never realize the in-
i Jury -It has caused until they feel the
vim, eneriry and buoyancy cf spirits
that a complete cure will bring.
"Weakness"
lty treatment for functional weak-
ness is original with me, and is the
only scientific and certain method be-
ing: employed. It is based upon abso-'
3 lute knowledge as to underlying con-
ditions, and conforms to every require-
ment essential to a thorough and last-
ing cure. Contrary to the popular be-
lief, weakness is not a nervous ail-
ment, but is a result of disorders pure-
ly local. Its successful treatment calls
; for utmost skill and the most delicate
prescribing. I employ no electrical or
mechanical contrivances, nor do I ex-
cite functional activity by the use of
etimulants or tonics. I treat by a
1 local process, such es no other physi-
cian employs, and one that cannot fail
to restore tie full degres of strength
and visor.
Contracted Disorders.
In these instances no language is too
strong to emphasize the importance of
i prompt and careful treatment. Cas?s
i that have been neglected or only par-
tialiy cured are almost certain to s?t
up inflammation in the prostate gland, S
v.hich in time becomes chronic and in-
terferes with the natural functions.
Through my Ion* experience treating \
these dteeases I have devised methods s
1 that not only cure soundly and per- 1
I manently, but cure in less time man 1
|i the best of other treatments require. j
CT Taku no chances. Do not risk your |
B health and manhood by relying on pat-
Hi cnt nostrums or uncertain method*:, it;

The principal matter decided in to-day's
opinion is that the provision of the stat
~me which declares that forest reserve lieu
selections can only be made on vacant
lands refers to the physical condition of
the iand. and prevents the selection of
lands which are occupied for mining or
any other purpose, even though no entry
of them has been made at the local land
office. . - , .- ... â¢
The very great attention which has been
given to the examination of authorities
relating to these cases, and the elaborate
and painstaking manner in which the
final decision has been prepared, indicates
that the policy and opinion of the Interior
Department may be now considered as
finally hetUed. . .
The decision announced to-day adheres
upon every point to the one heretofore
named. It elaborates the discussion of
tome questions, cites additional authori
ties upon others and discusses and refutes
such new arguments as were presented in
support of the motions for review.
Similar action will be taken in the Gray
Eagle oil case as soon as the decision can
be copied, which will be Monday or Tues
day of next week.
On account of the value of the land in
controversy and of the general Importance
of the Questions presented Assistant At
torney General Van Devanter permitted
oral arguments upon the motions for re
view and granted to the opposing parties
time within which to file further briefs.
Because of the pendency of a somewhat
similar case in the United States Court
of Appeals at San Francisco further
briefs before the Interior Department
were net filed until two or three months
ego. Since then the whole Question has
been gone over carefully by the Assistant
Attorney General, with the result that a
decision upon the motion for review in
the Kern oil case has been prepared ami
was to-day approved by the Secretary of
the Interior, fully adhering to the former
decision.
After the principal decisions almost a
year ago the lieu land selectors filed a
motion for review in each 'case, accom
panied by extended printed briefs.
The case of the Kern Oil Company
against Clarke and the Gray Eagle Oil
Company against the same party, Involv
ing lands in the Visalia land district in
California, were decided by the Secretary
against the lieu land selectors almost a
year ago. Upon the one hand the lands
in controversy were claimed by Clarke
under a forest reserve lieu land selection,
and on the other they were claimed by
the two companies named under placer
mining locations made to secure mineral
cils in the lands.

A STRIKING illustration of the force' of public sentiment in affecting the course of great
nations is afforded by the, contrast between the mortality figures of the British con
centration camps before the recent agitation and' exposure of the evil, and those of the
months which have succeeded: The latter have just been made public by the British
authorities and can be studied with satisfaction .by all who take ; any interest whatever . in the
cause of humanity. . r
Last October the death rate per thousand in the concentration camps was 338 for the
whole number of prisoners and 572 per thousand for childrenf under 12 years of age. It was the
publication of those and similar figures for the preceding months that aroused the whole civilized
world to indignant protest against the maintenance of camps or prisons where such mortality could
occur. The British authorities affected to be indifferent, but it was soon given out that changes
were to be made in the camps. The results are now attested by reports which show that the
death rate per thousand in February was for the whole number of prisoners only 72, while that
for children was 100. Â« â¢
The rates are still very high, but they show a marked improvement over those of last sum
mer and fall that strengthened the agitation against the concentration system. They also attest
the justice of the charges made against the' British military authorities for responsibility; for the
high death rate. The February^ returns attest that had proper care been exercised. in the first place
there need not have been that appalling mortality among children that shocked humanity. Miss
Hobhouse, who made the .exposure of the camps and who bore the brunt of official hostility, has
won a noble fight for humanity at large. . She has done as good a work in South Africa as Flor-.
ence- Nightingale did T at the Crimea and merits as high honors.;
IZI It now seems evident > that, the end of the war is at hand, and that "ere- long peace will once

strife. The most difficult thing to be accomplished in the task of reconciliation will . be that of
.eradicating from the minds of the sufferers of the concentration camps â¢ the horror of that fearful
death rate among ;,the .children;.: and it is therefore fortunate for the British that as something of
! an offset to ; the harshness of the military authorities who established the- camps, .they can set "the

The following storyâ that may possibly
have made Its debut before timeâ has tha
disadvantage of being true, but is never
theless ..interesting. A certain distin
guished member of the violin craft here,
whose name may or may not be J s.
was recently engaged with some other
musicians by a society woman to play
for an afternoon at her house. When tha
question of terms came up the fiddler and.
his confreres demanded the very modest
sum of. $3 a head for their services.
"What! Five dollars for three hours*
playing!" said the lady. "What exor
bitance!"
"What do you pay your waiters?" asked
the chief of the pirates of the tow.
"Only three dollars," promptly returned
the lady. .
â¢ TWell, . madame, it takes us Just eight
een months longer to> learn our trade
than it does your waiters," said J a
gravely.
Madame saw the. point, and to thÂ« credit
pf her . good heart and sense apologized,
handsomely. But there are still many
gaps in the ranks of the apologists. . -; : ;
Leon Moreau, the clever young French
composer who accompanied Mme. Nevada
on her recent visit here, has just received
the coveted French decoration of. the
Palmes Vertes. -Mr. Moreau received
pleasant word of the award in a letter
from his mother last week and later the
formal announcement of his new distinc
tion. The decoration has been conferred
for distinguished service to music In
France, including Important contributions
to musical literature and triumphant ef
fort In the Wagnerian cause in Paris,
where M. Moreau was long associated in
the battle of the music drama, Â¦with \I
Charles Lamouieux.
Which reminds me. Pablo Casals, whoso
brilliant "cello playing was the feature of
the Nevada concerts. Is still here, hav
ing met with an accident while climbin<*
Tamalpats. Mr. Casals was making the.
ascent of the mountain in company with
friends, when a shower of loosened stones
fell about them, a large one badly crush
ing the 'cellist's right hand. It i3 almost
certain that no permanent injury will re
sult and Mr. Casals expects to wield that
wizard bow of his again In about two

f M HE most remarkable dramatic per-
I formance of the week, perhaps of
I the season, was the production (in
ft Oakland!) by Howard Kyle of the
* long-promised "El Gran Galeoto,"
no?t famous play of the foremost con
temporary Spanish dramatist. Jose Eche
garay. Mr. Kyle promised the play dur
ing his recent engagement at the Califor
nia Theater, but Holy Week interfered,
and Oakland got the benefit. Our sister
city rose handsomely to the occasion,
fully fifty people greeting Mr. Kyle and
his company in the pretty Macdonough
Theater to do honor to the genius of the
distinguished playwright and the worthy
enterprise of the players. It Is unlikely
that any of the fifty will soon forget their
entertainmentâ if such it could be called
âof Friday evening last. For myself, I
recall but one play within my experience
with the vivid, breathless spell of "El
Gran Galeoto," "Hedda Gabler," as it
was given last year here by Blanche
Bates and her company. The Spanish
play reminds strongly of the Ibsen drama
In subject and method of treatment.
There is the same Intellectual, rather
than sensuous, appeal; the same fond
ne-s for dealing with the obscurer trage
dies of life, without, however, reaching
the profound depths of the subjective
ciud puddles that Ibsen has sounded;
With the fame pessimistic outlook. The
ethical viewpoint is possibly more normal
âas one Is apt to term the usualâ and in
"El Gran Galeoto" Echegaray certainly
answers the . questions he propounds. \
The drama, in fact, fairly reeks of
morals.. ,
Thackeray once asked. "If. one Is not
to speak of the lady who has just left
the room, what is to become of conver
sation?" Echegaray attempts to show hi
"El Gran Galeoto" what becomes of the
ladyâ and the man.
"El Gran Galeoto" is in three acts, with
a prologue that was not given by Mr.
Kyle and his confreres. The play is dedi
cated to "Everybody"â "El Gran Galeoto"
(the great go-between), whose thought
less words and lightly malicious glances
weave tragedy around their helpless vic
tims. The plot is of the simplest. A
joung man. Ernest, who has been edu
cated by a wealthy friend of his dead
father, to whom the said friend (Don
Julian) owes large gratitude, becomes
dissatisfied with his dependent position,
that has been gossiped about unpleasant
ly by his benefactor's relatives. Don
Julian, .who loves him as a son, has a
young- wife who also has a strong regard
Â¦ . _.Â«.Â¦
for her husband's protege, and the two
conspire to save Ernest's self-respect and
yet continue to befriend him by offering
him a secretary's position. Ernest joy
fully accepts the work, and Don Julian
leaves him delightedly discussing his
plans with Christina. Enter the gossips.
It is dusk and Ernest and Christina
have wandered to the balcony, still talk
ing. Don Severo, brother of Don Julian,
end Mercedes, . his wife, look in at the
door, note the darkness and hear the
voices. They are already excited over
some gossip they have heard, perhaps in
stigated; and perhaps, also, a little jeal
cus of this recipient of their -brother's
bounty, and immediately put the worst
construction on. the situation... .. Signora
Mercedes then proceeds to inform Chris
tina what she and "they" think of her
friendship for Ernest, and Don Severo
follows Don Julian to perform a like
friendly office for him. Christina and
truest, absolutely innocent, are bewild
ered and horrified- by the accusation. Don
Julian, utterly incredulous and furiously
angry at the gossip, returns with Don
Severo, and, good fellow that he is, puts
Christina's hand on Ernest's arm ami re
quests them to go in to dinner together.
They do so. talking softly. But Don
Julian Is profoundly moved In spite of
himself, and as the curtain falls, looking
at the disappearing figures of Ernest and
Christina, he says. "But why, why do
they speak so low?"
From then on the drama Is the story
of growing jealousy on Don Julian's part,*
with a magnificent but futile struggle to
regain his lost trust in his wife and his
adopted son. The progress of the poison
is painted with bitter strength, . and the
tremendous climax of. the last act, when,
dying from a wound received in defense
of his wife's good name, Don Julian drags
himself to the room where Ernest has
come to beg news of him," he screams.
"Let me see you look into each other's
eyes. I shall know then." is almost too
painfuL to be borne. He dies cursing
them, and Don Severo turns Christina out
of the house. .Then Ernest cries: "So you
fling us together Into the abyss. Yes, at
last you are right. I will confess. This
woman belongs to me. Do you want pas
sion? Then passion and delirium is here.
Do you want love? Then here is bound
less love. Nothing daunts me. Invent
what you will, I will exceed it. : So you
may tell the tale truly at last, until it
echoes through this heroic town. But
should any ask who is the Infamous pan
der to this villainy, you will reply, 'Our
selves,' lgnorantly, . but ourselves, and
with us the stupid chatter of the idle.'
Come, Christina, my mother kisses your
pure brow. Adieu, all, and let heaven
choose its day to judge between you and
me." . \

_ Aside from the first act, which has the
unusual fault of compression, the play ia
admirably constructed. The situations
are striking and plauslble-almost ine'vi
table^-and the dialogue natural and char
acteristic. The characters are drawn with
sure, broad almost brutal stroke, and de
veloped with, masterly consistency. The
piece lacks in detail, relief, somewhat
the author having disdained to use the
elegant padding. with which a Frenchman
would have relieved the gloom and stresd
of the situations or the neavier filling in
of the English school, for which amale
opportunity is offered by the story but
it remains nevertheless a great play, 'with
grip and thrill and irresistible, spell, and
one Is immensely grateful for the oppor
tunity of seeing it. : Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦*
As to its interpretation, Mr." Kyle and r
his company displayed a largely unex
pected strength in their handling of the
Play. Mr. Kyle, in the difficult part of
Ernest, .not by any means a becoming
role, did excellent work on the whole
Sh y e Â£? es nothln S very .badly, and
he had nothing to do in the first act. but
later, In the storm a,nd stress of the
Play, his work rose to the high level that
one might reasonably expect from an
actor who chooses to present "ElGrau
Galeoto . for his amusement.
Not easily the dreamy, romantic, sensi
tive youth of the first act, he was com
pletely identified with the later ErS
snowing a power that could not be readily
excelled. . Mr. Kyle's diction is wanting in
beauty and his gestures In erace hut
that he Is rapidly nearing a vefy worthv
position in his art last FrJday^peTforra^
auce puts beyond question. v Â¦
THE long' musical season comes to
a brilliant close this week with
the four piano recitals of Fannie
Bloomfield Zeisler, to be given. on
.Tuesday and Thursday nights and
"Wednesday and â¢ Saturday afternoons at
Metropolitan Hall. It is fiveâ mayhap
six-ryears . since . Mrs. Zelsler was here,
and from what I can gather she has been
growing every, minute of the time. She
is an unforgettable sort of person; a thin,
brown, "fiery little creature, with immense
power,^-immense chic, immense tempera
ment, amass of superlatives; hers is play
ing'that must'be listened to whether one
agrees or . not " with Its . message. I well
remember on Mrs; . Zeisier's ' last visit,
and it was at the Metropolitan Hall, too,
an occasion when the pianist had Slg
mund Beel-to assist her.. .Mrs. Zelsler
played a Grieg sonata with Mr. Beel and
It .was the most furiously funny perform
ance I ever heard. Mrs^'Zelsler's Grieg
was not "Mr. Beel's. either in rhythmic,
dynamic or, . any . other values, and Mrs.
Zeislcr had not the slightest hesitation in
so -say ingâ with those â¢ brilliant fingers of.
hers. Mr. Â¦ Beel.- being a gentleman, nat
urally permitted the la.dy to gang her aln
gait, fetching- up meekly somewhere In
the rear of things, but, having played
some little with thÂ«s violinist ; myself, I
can imagine all the things he left unsaid.

IN some quarters the will of the late'Gecil Rhodes has' been commented* on by the American
press as the most marvelous testament made since Caesar devised his estate to Rome. This
sentimental effusion is caused by its provision for students ; from every one of the United
States, in the English universities. The, avowed purpose of the. testator was to practically
make England and the United States, one./ No one can detracts ifrom the fame of Cecil
Rhodes. He had the diplomacy of Warren Hastings and the initiative dash of Robert, Lord
Give. His countrymen foiidly call him the Greatest Englishman, and their f expressions of ap
preciation of his character and service to the empire are, from their standpoint, more than
praiseworthy. â¢ -.;"'â¢ i. : . ' ; '' : ' ' '.,;/; â¢ :.
But the American ecstacy over his phenomenal liberality is without fair excuse under the cir
cumstances. His idea of making one of thi? country and England is grand in its conception, but
its accomplishment is not desirable for either country. Such dreams are not new. They dwelt
in the mind of Sardanapalus, and their web arid woof was an Assyria that blanketed the vyorld from
the Mediterranean to the Ganges." Genghiz Khan arid Timour had' such visions, and so ' before
them had Alexander and Caesar, arid, after them, 'Bonaparte. But these are dreams against nature.
Another Englishman, whose fame is eclipsed by that of this political imperialist, has vindicated the
designs of nature which stand against the device's of men who ignore her. Men are differentiated
by their environment,- and -in that law nature. has set an impassable limit to universal empire. In
their environment men take on an individuality 'which goes from them into their political institu
tions, and until nature changes her plan arid for variety substitutes monotony of environment,
common. institutions are impossible.
Nor in the aspect of its generosity, to; education can /"Americans justify laudation of; this im
perial testament. It devises an estate of twenty-five millions. But, in the lifetime of both;, Sen T ,
ator and Mrs. Stanford gave more than that to education. George Peabody gave a large fraction
of it, and the American citizen Andrew ; Carnegie has '-already far exceeded It, arid all that he has
given isto soriie.foWofleducation. Nor lias he been exclusive. Great Britain has been en
dowed by his liberality, and wherever these American gifts have been bestowed they have carried no
political nor imperial purpose. They have gone for the enlightenment of men and women in trie
wisdom of the world and the. uplifting teachings of science, carrying no obligation of im
perial federation. . ' ! ,: â¢'-â¢Â¦.. ':'â¢ Â¦ ' Â¦/Â¦.'Â¦Â¦; . Â¦Â¦ â¢
It may well be contended that Americans do not desire to become English nor English
men to become American. Starting from a common origin/ environment has differentiated vhem
for the good of each. The wisest Englishman desires to be what he is, and does not lack reasons
for being proud' of it. The same is true of the wisest American. One may doubt whether, educat
ing American youth in an English university will give them a better understanding of Great
Britain. It will perhaps incorporate them by sympathy and instinctinto the British community,
but that is far from implying a better understanding of that community. â¢
In our view, Cecil Rhodes stopped far short of an idea that might have earned for him
a more abundant ascription than' he now receives. If he had provided that an equal number of
English youth should be educated in American universities, the scope of his plan would have been
widened/and, above all, would carry the stamp of impartiality. As he left it, there is only
his assumption that only England is worth understanding, that in her institutions of learning only
can the highest absorption of the human mind be promoted and only his country is worth study.
That all deserves that the great Englishman be praised by his countrymen, but it reaily presents
no justification for ecstatic action here. ; .,' Â¦ i .-â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦'
The best study for Americans is their own civil polity, their conquest of things material
and of things ineffable, and that study is not best promoted bv the provisions of this re
markable will. " Â¦ - -' - , -
In contemplating.it we should' riot forget that if the liberality of which it is the expression
is rare among the rich .of Great Britain, it is far from being so here. American wealth has been
the - most li beral wealth the .world 5has ' ever , knp wn^ 1 1 has beenf^besto wed upon charity ' and edu
cation with a wisely lavish hand; and in no case has carried witli'its benefits the obligation to any-re

'Why" he said, "provisions in regard
to the Dalham estate carry no weight at
a!i. As a pious expression of opinion
their sentimental value is great, but It Is
ihe only value they do possess. The first
tenant entail in possession can upset
everything by the simple process of en
rolling a deed in chancery, or barring en
tail, to use a detail more familiar to the
lay mind, the Jaw does not recognize the
right of a testator to impose conditions
in perpetuity. It is a melancholy fact
that you and I may live to see a loafer
Joaiing on Cecil Rhodes' money."
LONDON, April 12.â Ever since the pub
lication of Cecil Rhodes' will the legal
fraternity has been scrutinizing its pro
visions and hunting up authorities to
demonstrate that certain of its features
ure invalid. One prominent King's coun
bcI summed up the will In this epigTam
matic phrase, "It is magnificent, but it Is
X'Ot law."

"IT'S MAGNIFICENT^
BUT IT ISNT LAW"
Patterson insisted upon: an explicit, re
ply, to his question, but General VMacAr
thur declared that he could not answer
more directly. He added that he had
epoken without reservation.
Before "the. * committee adjourned Pat
terson was permitted to propound an In
quiry which he said he did at the instance
cf a representative of the Boer cause, as
to whether General j MacArthur had any
knowledge of the enlistment of Ameri
cans in the Philippines for service in the
British army in South Africa. General
MacArthur replied that he had not
"My desire Is to speak here the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the
truth." .
"Do you in your testimony distinguish
between official information and informa
tion that may have come to you through
other sources?" " /'
"Yes, I have a good deal of question on
that point," replied' the witness. "I have
never seen^ anything to Justify such an
opinion outside of what I have seen in
print. I can only say that I understood
the order to be fdi"*a fight, and all that
has come to me to the contrary haa been
ex parte in character." â¢ .
"Have. 3 T ou any question now, as a sol
dier and an officer of the army, that there
was an understanding that the resistance
of the Spaniards was to be purely nom
inal?" asked Senator Patterson.
General MacArthur then related that
on the evening previous to the attack on
Manila, after General Merritt had issued
bis order of battle, he (MacArthur) was
in consultation .with General : Anderson
when the- latter received a communica
tion from General Merritt/ directing him
to lnfcrm Agninaldo that-.- the battle
which was to take place, next day was
between, the Americans' and Spaniards
and that he must not participate under
any circumstances. . Aguinaldo was at
that . time. General MacArthur said, five
miles away, and' the message was sent to
Liin by wire. He knew, however, that
the Filipino' leader had received it, be
cause he had declined to accept the sug
gestion, and he and his native forces had
participated in the engagement the next
cay. What had become of that communi
cation General MacArthur said he did
not know.
"Assuming the facts to be as stated,"
the witness replied, "if that were all there
is 'n the premises, it might be admitted
that inference was "to be drawn as indi
cated. But there are other facts which
form a part of the case and which show
the co-operation in the attack on Manila
was not a voluntary one on our part."
General MacArthur was again to-day
the only witness before the committee,
and his examination was begun by Sena
tor <;ulberson. 'His questions related to
the relationship between the native forces
and the American troops, when the latter
first landed at Manila. : Senator Culber
son called attention to the fact that "there
is testimony on Hie to the effect that
General Anderson had writen to Agui
naido inviting his co-operation at Manila,
and that the latter haa accepted, and that
it also Is stated that General Merritt had
himself sent an aid to General Greene,
suggesting that arrangements be > made
with the Filipinos ;*or a common under
standing in the occupation of the
trenches. He -then askeo if. in view of
these facts, the- inference was not author
ized that iriendly co-operation ' was de
sired by the American officials with the
Filipinos Â¦ in - the attack upon \ the Span
iards. .
WASHINGTON. April 12.â The Senate
Committee on the Philippines began its
proceedings to-day by adopting a resolu
tion offered by Senator Carmack, calling
upon the Secretary of AVar for all the
orders, circulars and official N reports re
ceived from commanders . and their.,sub
ordlnates in the provinces of Tayabas,
Batangas, Samar and Laguna.
Cotifiitions teemed rir>e . for en attempt to
gam control of Louisville and Nashville, and
siouthern Railway interests, as represented by.
Morgan & Co.. authorized the Moore brothers
to acquire as much or the stock as possible in
the open market, with the understanding- that
this stock would be taken over by the South
ern Railway. Hanking interests In which thn
Moores are esoeciaily. prominent have been
heavy buyers of Louisville and Nashville, and
one bank in particular is said to have called
a number of leans this week so as to accumu
late the money lor Us purchases of Louisville
ttock. . Â¦
ATLANTA, Ga., April 12.â If the Louis
ville and Nashville system has passed
into the hands of the Southern Railway
it will leave but two lines of road in the
Southern Statesâ the Southern and the
Seaboard Air Line. Although it has not
been officially, announced, it is believed
here that the Atlantic Coast line and
Plant system will soon come â¢ under- the
control of the Southern Railway.
The roads controlled by the Louisville
and Nashville are the Nashville. Chatta
nooga and St. Louis, the Western and At
lantic, the Atlanta, Knoxville and North
ern, the Georgia Railrcad and several
smaller lines and the recently acquired
roads. The number cf miles included in
the merger under control of the Southern
aggregates 21,349.
An interesting feature of the situation
is the part the State of Georgia may play
in the rumored combination. The State
owns the Western and Atlantic, which
runs from Atlanta to Chattanooga and is
leased by the Nashville. Chattanooga and
St. Louis. The Southern is already oper
ating a line between these cities, and the
Central of Georgia, which is under the
control of the Southern, has a road from
Chattanooga to Griffin, Ga. The effect of
the purchase of the Louisville and Nash
ville by the Southern is said by eome to
mean that at the expiration of the pres
ent lease the State road will be complete
ly bottled up, rendering it merely a local
line betwen Atlanta and Chattanooga,
When asked his opinion on the matter
Governor Candle r said:
"I don't think there is any danger of
the roads bottling up the State road.
While railroad combinations are very
powerful they cannot cope with the State
of Georgia, for if euch attempts were
made- the result would be euch drastic
legislation in Georgia that the railroads
would have to pay more money than they
could make on the transaction."
Some time aKo Southern Railway interests,
alaniied at the increasing etrengiu and pros-
Iierity ut Louisville and Nashviue, made an
oiter lor a majority intense The otter was
declined, so report has it, by foreign holders
ol LouiiVille and Nashville. Who held the bal
unce 01 jHjwer. Recently when. Louisville and
.Nashville increased its capital etock by ?5,(XKJ,
(AXi Gates and his associates .saw an oppor
tunity to "Â¦squeeze" the insiders by buying
Louieviile in the market and creating a scarc
ity in the stock. To what extent the' Gates
laction t-ucceeded ii still a* matter of conjec
ture, but it is nut doubted that they were in a
:x>sition to swing a large block ot stock either
way. -
NEW YORK, April 12.â As a result of
several conferences here to-day there la
a very general conviction that control of
ihe Louisville and Nashville road has
passed or will pass to the Southern Rail
way. Representatives of both these roads
and a member of the Gates faction were
in consultation early in the day, and later
John W. Gates was closeted for almost an
hour vith George W. Perkins at the of
fice of J. P. Morgan & Co. Neither Per
kins nor Gates would gay what had
pasaed between them, but it was admit
t<.a that the Louisville and Nashville sit
uation was discussed in its several phases.'
The most authoritative report dealing
with the recent course of Louisville ana
Nashville is substantially as follows: ,

The Government has advertised the sale of
the transport Rosecrans and sealed bids will be
received by the general superintendent of the
transport service until noon or April 24. The
Egbert Is also to be sold, but will have to be
surveyed by a valuation board before bids are
asked. The Rosecrans. although a foreign
built ship, will be given American register.
The Egbert loses her right to fly Old Glory
when she passes out of the Government's hands.
She was a British ship when Uncle Sam bought
her and a British ship she will be again, just
as soon as he sells her. It will require an act
of Congress to give the Egbert American reg
istry.
Cannery Boats Clear.
Quite a fleet of vessels cleared yesterday for
Bristol. Bay with supplies and cannery labor

morning. Those that cleared yesterday were

the others were army wives and children

Two brides-to-be were assigned trans

Another remarkable case Is that of E. W.
Drummond. of ' Garland, Kansas. Mr. Drum-
mend wns totally blind. Four leading physi-
cians had told him there was absolutely no
hope for recovery.' He writes: "As I was
totally blind in both eyes, a renowned special-
ist told me there was no hope. I was almost
crazed on account of this terrible affliction. I
heard of Prof. - Weltmer, the great Nevada
healer, and : placed myself under his care. He
treated me three days in his office and told me
to go home and he would continue treating me
at my home. In two weeks I^pould distinguish
light from darkness, and in less than one
month I could see perfectly. I shall ever re-
gard Prof. Weltmer as my savior, and may
heaven's richest blesslag ever be his in his ef-
fortr to bring health and happiness to the af-
flicted thousands all over this land."
Prof. S. A. Weltmer, the noted scientist of
Nevada, Mo., and the originator of ths 'Welt-
mer method of healing diseases without the
knife and without medicines, has demonstrated
in thousands of Instances that his method of
treatment was of such an efficacious nature
that there were very few of the chronic dis-
eases heretofore termed hopeless and incurable,
that would not succumb to hU method. Thou-
sands of people â men, women and children in
overy walk of life â have "testified; many of
them on their oath, that Weltmerism had cured
them after their family physicians and others
had termed their cases incurable. He has
alro had under his care men and women of
national reputation, such as United States Sen-
ators, Congressmen and Governors of States,
people to whom any method of treatment is
available, and as they have attested to this
grand -treatment it certainly must have in it
elements of unusual strength., To hear -of a
man 7 in this century being able to make .the
deaf - hear, the blind see and the lame walk,
reverts our minds back-to ths miracles of olden
times. Tet. these sensational cures have been
perfected from time to- time by Prof/ S.'
A. WeUmer. Take,' for instance, the case of
Mrs! Indiana Godwin, wife of Thomas W. God-
win, who is the head of -the "great Virginia
Iron Works Co., Norfolk. Va. Mrs. Godwin
suffered for many years with deafness and head
noises. She waa pronounced absolutely incur-
able by the best ear specialists In the United
States. She was permanently cured by Prof.
Weltmer's famous absent - treatment method.
Eho writes* under date of February 28: "My
husband took me to the Clifton Springs Sani-
tarium of New York, where la supposed to be
the best rklU and talent in the United States.
I was Informed that my case was hopeless and
a cure Impossible. We came home, my mind
made up to bear my affliction, when I saw
Prof. Weltmer's advertisement. I determined
to try It. with little hope, but Imagine my
surprise when In four days after taking the
absent treatment, I could hear the clock tick
on the mantel while lying in my bed. and I con-
tinued to grow better and better, until to-day I
can hear better than ever before. May the Great
and Blessed God. who is all mercy and com-
passion, abundantly bless, guide and direct
Prof. Weltmer in the great work of healing tha
Intiimlties of suffering humanity." â¢
PROF. S. A.
WELTMER.
Possibly one of the most remarkable ease*
that Is known to science la - that of L. D.
Trlplett. a highly esteemed citizen of 1310 Main
street. Akron. O.. who suffered from a terrible
electric shock, fvhlch caused his body, from,
hl3 waist to his feet, to become paralyzed. Be
became an Invalid and was unable to use his
lower limbs. Hla stomach refused to do It*
natural duties and gradually he became almost
a living skeleton. A few months ago he placed
himself under Prof. Weltmer's care, but be-
fore doing this he called on his family physi-
cian and asked him to carefully examine him.
The physician did so. and said that he could
do nothing for him. His improvement under
Prof. WeUmer waa almost immediate, and in
three weeks* time he was able to sit up. With-
in . five weeks his stomach waa acting in its
natural way. the first time in six years. He
is now a happy and healthy man, in full pos-
session of his faculties and body, and a hen rt
full of appreciation of the marvelous care made
through Prof. Weltmer"3 method. Nojmatter
what your disease nor how many have termed
it incurable, there is hope for you in this won-
derful treatment, which does away with knife
and drugs as well as all torturous methods.
It -re not necessary for you to leave your bom*
to receive this treatment, for you can be cured

To-morrow morning we Inaugurate a
Great exhibition and sale of the very
chcicest and the most costly American
pianofortes ever seen in San Francisco.
G rends and uprights, in cases of the very
fanciest and rarest mottled mahogany,
Er^lish oak and figured or burl walnut.
- eniion was made last week of thÂ» ar-
rival of a carload of the time-tried and
tir-.e-honored Hazelton pianos, aid we
beg to call attention of musicians, and
music lovers to the beautiful creations of
tho Messrs. Hazelton now to be seen at
cur salesrooms.
I\o matter what claims may be made for
otr.er makes of pianos, there is not a
l)li.no manufacturer in America who has ;
Ei uniformly maintained the very highest
artistic standard of his pianos for nearly
ha f a century as have the Hazeltons.
Ycu will find here now the very choicest
Ei. lections from this renowned factory in
cabinet grand uprights and parlor and
LÂ«_3y grands.
Attention has also been called to the
r :Â¦ pected arrival of a large shipment of
iho famous many toned "Crown" pianos.
*j Ley arrived late last week, and more
Uautiful pianos in every respect were
never seen than these fancy Crown up-
il^ht pianos.
jThere was a time when all that could
to had in a jiano was the regular piano
tc ae.
Tis different now.
By means of the many toned Crown
p. ano a player is enabled to imitate and
j <. produce perfectly the tones of a dozen
or more different musical instruments,-
Ei:ch as the harp, mandolin, zither, banjo,
e;c. A practice clavier, valuable to all
l'iano students, is also supplied in this
T ano.
L'nlike the so-called "attachments," the
instrumental features of Crown pianos
tasrm the instrument from wear. .They are
therefore warranted by the makers, a3
\. ell a s by ourselves, for double the usual
length of lime.
In the now famous Kimball pianos we
r.re able to show but two different styles
just at this time. The great Kimball fac-
lories â greatest on earthâ are very much
l>ehind orders. They will not permit their
jiianos to be unduly hurried; everything
must be carefully tried and tested before
a piano leaves the factory, and we there-
fore have to await our turn along with
other large dealers in this country and
abroad.
A carload of New Scale Klmballs is ex-
pected to arrive here Tuesday, however,
and still another will come in toward the
end of the week, eo that in a few days we
shall be able to show a- most comprehen-
sive assortment of these renowned and
popular pianos also.
But the two styles of the Kimball now
here are beauties in case design, finish
and tone quality.
The famous World's Fair exhibition
styles, in fancy quarter-sawed English
cak cases, deserve special mention. â¢
Also the dainty new small Colonial
styles, in mottled walnut and fancy se-
lected mahogany cases.
SOMETHING ABOUT PRICES.
Such instruments as above described
have heretofore been sold at $500, $60J,
yes, even 1700 and $T50. But our principle
of "quick sales and email profits" will be
as rigidly applied to these pianos as to
every other make handled by us.
You can safely count on being able to
eecure one of these pianos here now at a
caving cf $100, $150 and in some cases even
a clean $200. Every instrument is marked
Â«nd will be sold at absolutely one price.
No more will ever be asked, no less will
ever be accepted, except the 3 per cent
<Uscount for all cash with order.
SEVERAL 0FTHES300 PIANOS
FOR $186 LEFT.
A number of the beautiful regular $Â£00
uprights advertised during the past ten
days at the astonishingly low price of $1S6
and $1S3 can still be obtained here. Nor Is
this the cheapest piano that we handle.
Instruments usually sold for $250 are here
$137â the $200 kinds ara 4138â ami everythng
we Bell is fully warranted. Please bear,
this In mind. "Money back if not as rep-
resented or satisfactory" applies to every-
thing we selL r '.^
IN SECOND-HAND PIANOS.
Square pianos and old uprights are
never allowed Â¦ to accumulate on our
hands. During the past week we /have
received a great many of these old timers
In part payment for new pianos, end all
of these old ones must be sold during the
coming week. Take your choice for $3 a

.The maintenance of way department -of

â¢.'Rehearing denied." With this brief ex
pression the Supreme Court yesterday
forever settled the executors' fight- for the
control of the millions left by the late
James G. Fair. The last resource : has
been exhausted and now the Falr^ heirs
can divide and spend the enormous for
tune involved in the litigation as suits
their own desires.
The court annulled Fair's will part and
parcel a little less than a month, ago. By
the term" of the will William S. Good
fellow, James Angus, Thomas Crothera
and their successors were empowered to
control the estate after the death ot
Fair's three children, J3y the decision ot
the -Supreme. Court, the property, bottÂ»
real, and' personal, passes Immediately
into the hands of Charles Fair, Virgin!*
Vanderbllt and Theresa Oelrichs.
The attorneys for the executors, a few
days after the opinion was rendered, filed
a petition for a rehearing. This was their
last resort. - On Friday Garret. McEner
ney, acting In behalf of the executors;
filed a second" petition for a rehearing.
Yesterday morning he filed a third petition.
Yesterday afternoon the court placed on
record its final decision, In. the words
"Rehearing denied." That is the answer
to the three petitions in which were em
bodied the results of so much leffal re
search and so much refined and pointed
sarcasm. ._
It means that the contest over the Fair
estate* valued- at approximately $1S,OOQ,000.
is finally disposed of. Mrs. Craven Is still
trying to institute further litigation, but
Is meeting with the most discouraging re
sults. William S. Goodfellow has within
a few days taken steps to withdraw from
his position as executor. The various atr
torneys who. have handled the lengthy
litigation have collectively secured about
$2,000,000 from the estate as fees for their
services. No other contests are threat
ened or thought of, so far as is known. .
Dr. Bennett would have sent the '. $3000
to Mains had he not been warned in time
by his banker.' He . will appear at the
trial as a witness against Mains.
The Federal Grand Jury yesterday re
ported a - true bill of indictment against
Charles R. Mains,' the representative ' of
a fake four-blllJon-dollar syndicate. ' The
indictment contains three counts, each
one of which charges Mains with having
devised a scheme to defraud Dr. Charles
E. Bennett Â¦ of Wauseon, Ohio, out of
money, which scheme was to be effected
by communication with Bennett through
the postoffice. The indictment charges
further that Mains attempted to secure
from Bennett $3000 in consideration of his
making Bennett president of the four
billion-dollar syndicate. Each count
quotes a 1 long. letter from Mains- to. hi3
intended victim, and the allegation is
made that he posted or caused to be post
ed these letters . in the United States
mails. Â¦* - Â¦ Â¦Â¦.-Â¦'.Â¦

a law authorizing" the payment of trav
eling expenses to a deputy at large while
engaged in the work of extending the
order.
The question of having biennial ses
sions, instead of annual sessions, will
again be brought up on the ground of
economy. It is claimed that there is lit
tle occasion for new la.ws for the order
and the money that could be saved by
having a session but once in two years
could be used for extension purposes. Â¦- '

Sniffen and Welch on No. 1 Little Skookum,
at the foot of Cheechaco Hill, have struck a
solid quartz lead over six feet in width, car
rying free gold and concentrates of gold bear
ing pyrites of galena. A shaft eighteen feet
deep has been sunk. The ore in this shaft Is
the same, as found in some of the veins on the
Lone Star group at the head of Victoria Gulch.
The lead seems to have about the same trend
of the Lone Star lead's,' running northwesterly
and southeasterly, being, it is said, a continua
tion of one pf the Lone Star leads, about five
miles northwest of the Victoria discovery. Mr.
Sniffen lives on a. fraction of No.' 1 A, above
discovery on^Bonanza' CreelCTfind.ia'at present

Brenton is having a mining boom. Twenty
one deeds have just been recorded with County
Recorder Delury. conveying the mining proper
ties In Montgomery mining district, located and
controlled- . bj* S. P. Lines and J. B. Cowan.
The properties were purchased by the White
Mountal'n Mining Company,' a corporation or
ganized-under the laws of the State of Dela
ware. The deeds cover about forty claims, to
gether with water rights and mill site loca
tions, and it is the intention of the corpora
tion to begin work on an extensive scale.
.Thorough teEts have â¢ been made and good
values obtained from the ores in this group of

i A letter from a Dawson correspondent
brings the following information:
The Bridgeport Chronicle-Union says:
Dredger mining Is. now. one. of the most Im
portant forms of mining in the county, re
quiring large .and giving, employment to
many men. This kind of mining Is too Impor
tant to be- touched upon In a general way and
will be' made "the subject of' the last of these
articles upon the^ resources of .Butte County.
Borne of the points most "deserving-, of notice in
connection : with - mining in ; . Butte Is at â¢ Bangor,
where . the Blue- Lead Â¦ is "- the j principal source
of wealth. "' At. Cherokee is. the moat extensive
hydraulic - mine â¢ in the , county. .; Two thousand
inches ! of . water, â¢ are 'Â¦ used and ; the banks that
are washed down" are over .400 feet In" height.
On Morris Ravine are several very j profitable
mines. All of these, are worked by drifts and
"contain-coarse 6v nugget gold. I On. the Magalla
ridge are very extensive gravel mines and -along
! Butte-' Creek is one of -the 'Â¦> richest Â¦ sections -of
the county.- Many millions ot dollars have been
taken from the mines of Butte and they have
built-up and made noted a number of towns
and mining camps. .We, believe. it a fair es
timate to .say "that more than one-fifteenth of
the people are directly or Indirectly dependent
upon mining for a living. - This Is exclusive of
the men employed- m. ; dredger mining near Oro
ville. Â¦
The Oroville Register.'.is. deyo ting much
space to ' recapitulating the advantages "6C
Butte. County for . mining ; and makes an
excellent showing. . In a summary are the
following" observations: ' ,: .. , .',.
Butte â¢ County's Outlook.
Â¦ Every^mining 'section is active; Pros
pectdrs were never. more. numerous In re
cent years than, now, nor; were; there" at
any time more companies planning to test
the mineral resources of the Pacific Coast
to : their fullest " extent. This State is
fully holding Its share of attention, as
new. enterprises indicaterefy clearly. | In
the movement', now, under way ;to boom
the resources pf California the mining in
dustry' bids fair to *;be Â¦" assisted very
largely '-by'', the efforts of, the State Min
eralogist/ who ; is sending out a flood of
exact 1 information in bulletins, maps and
registers. In no section Is there any com
plaint of lack of water. ; The copper in

Nearly all the omcers were present, and
after Miss Eaves read her report its fea
tures were discussed by "William Denman,
who urged the establishment of a free
clinic for giving legal advice to the poor
under the protection of the settlement.
An address along the same lines was
made by Dr. Babcock. The meetingf was
followed by a reception and light lunch
eon. .
Another important branch of settlement work
which should receive more attention In the
future Is that of legal aid to the people o(
the neighborhood. We have had several cases
where most timely and substantial assistance
has been rendered. Under present conditions
the poor and ignorant have little chance of
securing a redress of wrongs in our courts.
It is hoped that we may have established some
definite period for free consultation at the set
tlement house and that we can secure the co
operation of several lawyers in the handling
of such worthy cases as we may find in our
neighborhood.
The Christmas holidays were days of
joy to the children in- the vicinity of the
settlement, hundreds of whom .were'fur
nished with good cheer. *A feature of the
weekly meetings is the stereopticon lec
tures, which attract large gatherings to'
the settlement. The report includes many
valuable suggestions, one of which is as
follows: . ' â¢
During the year 28 settlement- clubs
were organized, with a total weekly' at
tendance of over, 400. Each , of -the clubs
has its own officers and 'all business- 1 ' is
transacted with a due regard. to parlia
mentary practice. Of the- clubs' organ
ized 8 are for women, 8; for girls,.' 2 for
young men, 7 for boys and 2 are made

.The council will meet at a date in the
near future and elect omcers. The pres
ent officers probably will be re-elected. ,
Miss Lucille Eaves, resident in charge
of the settlement, tiled an encouraging
annual report. The settlement moved into
its new quarters in South^Park in March,
1901, and since that time shdps, club arid
reading rooms and quarters, tor the resi
dent force have been (established.- Tho
Shaw Gymnasium in the rear has a seat
ing capacity of .400 and may be readily
converted into a . theater, lecture, concert
or dance hall. â¢ ' -^ .: . ;
Tne permanent .resident force consists
of three men and six women, and of the
latter three give their entire, .time
to settlement work. - During the
year two singing . classes were, main
tained, as were also two or three classes
in manual training. The younger chil
dren "were given simple gymnasium
drills and frequent shower baths.". A 1
course of six lectures on, California his
tory was given,, and an excursion on the
bay, as well as several outings given the
Mothers' Clubs, served ;to .render .the
memories of the "year very pleasant. : :
The annual meeting of the - South -Park
Settlement was held yesterday at the
Resident House, 86 South Park, and new
officers for the ensuing year were elected
as- follows: . . ' â¢
There is likely to be a. white-tented city
âone at the northwest end of the city
near the Presidio Reservation: one in
Richmond District, one in South San
Francisco and one in the Mission
district, each patrolled by Knights
of the Uniform Rank day and
night. The streets . of these tent^
ed cities will be lined with orange trees
brought from the citrus belt and from the
semi-tropic regions of Southern Califor
nia- The most prominent florists of San
Francisco and vicinity are members of
the Pythian' order, and they have deter
mined that they will produce the most
magnificent floral jdisplay . during the
Pythian gathering that has ever been
seen here, and will, thus give visitors an
object lesson of California's floral wealth
in August. â¢: .-..'>
A White Tented City.
Congress by special act has authorized
the Secretary of War to loan 1000 tents
for the occasion, and it is understood that
as many more tents can be had from the
army as may be required to accommodate
the 10,000 Knights of the Uniform Rank
who will parade and drill on our streets.
The number of tents may be increased
from 1000 to 2000, and perhaps even more.
Van Ness avenue is to be transformed
into a grand street fair. . The exhibits will
line both : .sides of ihe - avenuÂ£, from its
intersection with Market street "down to
the beach. Some, of; the. counties win re
quire the length of an entire block to show
their wonderful products. Agriculture,
horticulture, viticulture, mining,' oil pro
ducing and every -industry, of the State
will be given ample ' space." to . show, the
strangers the wealth of California.. A"car
load of fruit a. day will be sent from some
sections of the State for free distribution.
Bearing fruit trees will be brought here
and planted along the "curbs to show the
visitors that all they see is real. The
.giants of California's famed forests will
be planted in the middle of the roadway
for strangers to gaze upon. There will be
practical demonstrations of quartz ' and
hydraulic mining in some -section of the
city. Wells will -be bored for ocular dem
onstration, and many interesting object
lessons will be given. A complete '49 over
land train camping in the city will form
one of the attractions. The train will be
brought here by the people of San Diego
County. .
Grand Street Fair.
The most encouraging reports , daily
from different parts of the country show
that i the gathering ' will be the largest
ever held in this city. The Sacramento
Chamber of Commerce has appropriated
$1000 to aid the. exhibit of products from
the Sacramento district. That, sum is in
addition, to what other industrial and
commercial organizations of; Sacramento
County will subscribe. Every city and
county in California is fully alive to the
great importance of making the very best
showing of its resources. As it is impos
sible to induce all the visitors to travel
and , inspect, every section of California,
the people of the interior have concluded
to. bring their exhibits to San Franicsoc,
where every visitor will be able to see
what California is capable of producing.
The finance committee, composed of
members of the executive committee
which is to make arrangements for the
general gathering of Pythians "in San
Francisco in August, has commenced its
canvass among the business men, and has
met with the most generous responfae
Â¦from, all' those --who "have been thus far
called upon to subscribe. In order to dee
orate and illuminate the city for the. oc
casion and fittingly entertain the. visit
ors a great sum' of money will be re
quired. The Palace Hotel has subscribed
JlCOO, the Union Trust Company has given
?2S0 and Foster, & Fay of the Grand Ho
tel added $200 as their share. These
amounts are the best indications that the
business men of San Francisco fully ap
preciate, the importance of the coining
of so many visitors to the city.

"Protection as an Elimination -of Waste.
Mr! Young ably handled the question and
pointed -out the manifold advantages .-of
"protection." its value to the *. worjclng

.develop sometimes from very trifling causes, .and when and where you would least expect
them. A boil, .or abscess, burn, blister, wart, . tumor, mole, or the, simplest little pimple
may be the beginning point of a malignant, frightful ' looking Cancerous Ulcer.-
Apparently there is no difference between a Cancerous and Common Ulcer. when
i they first make their. appearance, and for this reason every ulcer, no matter how insignificant:
or harmless it may seem, and all slow healing sores should excite' suspicion and cause
alarm, particularly if any of your ancestors ever had Cancer, or you have good reason to
think your blood is impure; for the sore, after, all, is; only the outgrowth, the external
evidence of polluted blood, and nothing can check its progress until the cancer tainted,
vitiated, blood has been purified.- All efforts to heal the ulcer". by. means of salves or other
external remedies will result in failure, for such treatment can have no possible effect upon
the deadly germs and morbid matter that form in the blood and are carried through the
circulation to the sore, vi^' - â¢ . .,

The Next Five Months Will
Decide This Question
FOR THOUSANDS.
â¢;. Â¦
Hundreds of men and women afflicted
with coughs, catarrh, bronchitis and con-
sumption are just now congratulating
themselves that winter is over and the
warm months coming, which bring relief
to their weakened lungs and the hope of
recovery to their hearts.
One thing, however, is certain, warm
v. eather will not kill the germs . which
cause these diseases, and unless - thev
are destroved before the next winter,
thousands -wiil never seen" another sum-
mer's sun.
Of all seasons In the year the months
of June. July. August and September af-
ford the sufferer from respiratory dis-
eases the best opportunity to stamp out
these terrible scourges, and if consump-
tives and people afflicted with catarrh
and bronchitis can only -be taught " that
this season is the one during which na-
ture exerts all her influences to cast off
these diseases, they would do their, ut-
most to assist her.
It is perhaps unnecessary to again re-
mind you that according to Government
Statistics, no remedy ever given for these
diseases reduced the death rate from, them
in the least until Hyomei, the new dry-
air germicide, was found, and that since
then the deaths from consumption alone,
have fallen off over thirty per cent an-
nually. Such are the facts, however." and
if persons suffering from consumption, or
any other germ disease of the air pas-
sages will use the new remedy faithfully
during the next five months, they can
completely destroy the germs 'causing the
disease and In "this "way onljF free them-
selves from these terrible maladies.
No teaspoonf ul doses are required. You
einaply carry the Hyomei Inhaler in your
mouth for ten or fifteen minutes ' four
times daily, and breathe "naturally. No
expense Is incurred until you are positive
that it will benefit you, for a five "days'
treatment is sent free to all who' apply. to

Mrs. Churchill alleges that on the night
of April 4 Churchill took their little child
and in the presence of the guests of the
Hotel Beresford, where they reside, un
mercifully beat her. The screams of the
little girl, Mrs. Churchill alleges, could
be heard at a distance and expressed such
great agony that all the guests of the
hotel thronged to the spot. Churchill,
Mrs. Churchill further alleges, left the
crowd and with the little one under his
arms proceeded to his rooms, where, it 1s
alleged, he continued the beating. Mrs.
Churchill alleges that he locked the door
and refused to admit her to the room,
though she begged and pleaded with him
to let her in and care for the child,
whose screams could still be heard
throughout the hotel. He finally opened
the door, alleges Mrs. Churchill, and al
lowed her and a lady friend to enter the
room. They found the little girl, alleges
the plaintiff, sobbing in a heart-breaking
ir.anner and bearing every evidence of the
brutal beating. The bruises of the infant
were carefully tended by her friend, al
leges Mrs. Churchill, while her husband
Â¦went out and purchased a supply of
liquor. He returned to the rooms, al
leges his wife, and because she spoke of
his treatment of the child he struck her
three brutal blows on the face, cutting
her lips and bruising her face.'
"I ran into the hall," alleges Mrs.
Churchill, "and he pursued me. 1 grabbed
the bannisters to save myself and he
grabbed me by the throat and choked me
In an endeavor to make me loosen my
hold. He struck me again and left me. to
crawl, bleeding and suffering, to the door
of the elevator, where I was found by the
boy in charge of the lift. The guests of
the hotel took care of me and my child
for the rest of the night. I can never live
Â¦with Mr. Churchill ajraln. as neither my
life or that of my child will be safe."
The Churchills were married in 1S9S.

A bold daylight burglary was commit
ted at the residence of W. J. Moore, 1412
Powell street, last Friday. Mrs. Alocre
left the house about 11 o'clock in. the
morning, after carefully locking the
doors and windows. She was gone -only
about an hour and when she returned'she
found that the house had been ransacked.
The bureau drawers had been overhauled,
the bedding had been thrown on the floor
in- a search for money and valuables and
truaks and valises rifled. Mrs. Moore had
$70 hidden in -a bag in which she kept her
comb and brush, and the burglars had
taken it from its fastening, but, fortu
nately, had overlooked the purse con
taining the money.
Mrs. Moore's eealskin coat, two valu
able silk dresses, silk waists and all her
jewelry were stolen, and her husband's
diamond pin. studs, sleeve links and other
articles were carried away. The burglars
had used a large valise to aid them In
taking the stolen property from the
house. Entrance had been effected by
means of a stolen key. Strange to say, no
one in the immediate locality saw the
burglars enter or leave the house.
The police were notified by Mr. Moore
soon alter the burglary, and Captain Sey
mour detailed Detective Armstrong qn
the case, but as yet no trace of the bur
glars has been found.

J. B. Sanford, Assemblyman from Men
docino County, delivered a brief address.
He told a humorous story and then dis
cussed the theme. "Democracy and Fu
ture Legislation." He thought the-sub
ject a broad one and he treated It from
that standpoint. It meant equal and ex
act justice to all and special privileges
to none. Democracy Intended to do away
with all "Isms." It Intended to say to
those who demanded special privileges to
"go 'way back and sit down. The Dem
ocracy did not propose to- rob any one and
it did not propose to be robbed by any
one. Three-fourths of California was
owned by one-tenth of -the people and it
was necessary to see to It that the other
nine-tenths had their rights respected.
The speaker believed that If the Democ
racy of California came out on the right
platform a Democratic Governor would
sit in the chair next year. The Demo
cratic party was the party of the people,
and if the people were properly Instructed
there would be no question as to the re
sult. "We will win this time," continued
the speaker, "If we stop our darned non
sense of hurling brickbats at every Popu
list who takes an interest in the Issues
of the day. (Laughter.) Let us not lose
heart. The government Is by the people
and it will prevail. Let us exalt .the
hearthstone; build, up the home and ele
vate individualism, if we hope to win."
J.-C. Hughes sang a song in good. style,
and Hon. R. M. Fitzgerald of Oakland re
sponded to the -toast of "Our Country."
In auick succession - Judge Maurice T.
Dooling of San Benlto County spoke on
"The Workshop and the School,". R. P.'
Troy, of San Francisco responded to the
toast,*."Democracy and the Trust Evil."
Arthur H.Barendt delivered a humorous
response to the toast. "The Press." and
J. P. Coonan won favor by his remarks
on "Democracy and the Farmer." Other
speakers .were J. C. Sims, Curtis HUlyer,
Nicholas Bowden of Santa Clara County,

Commandant W. D. Suydam, B. V. Sar
gent, J. D. Sproul of Butte County and

like ourselves. What are you going: to do with
them? Some my they are so constituted as
to be unfitted to take charge of their own
affairs. Others say they are not. I differ with
both opinions. The people of the Philippines
ore not savages. They have not reached a
high' degree of civilization, but there are
among them cultivated and able men who will
compare favorably with the cultivated and
civilized of other nations. The endeavor to
repress and suppress the honorable ambitions
of the 'Filipinos, who are trying to work out
their own salvation, is not right. Let It not
be forgotten that independence always means
liberty. Many of us do not enjoy liberty. Tha
middle of the road is the fair course. Now.
since what has been done has been done, the
question is. Shall we turn these people loose
at the gates of China, now or nve years hence,
to be the prey, of the harpies of Kurope now
encamped in the Orient, or shall we turn them
loose as the children of liberty, such as we were
125 years ago? - Â¦ Would this ba for the benefit
and- happiness of the people for whom wo
stand responsible before the entire world? ThÂ«
idea - of nationality is an honorable feeling,
but to grant to the Filipinos the right to keep
house for themselves Is another affair. There
should be no promises made to these people
which we are not in a position to carry out.
I love these people for their many and noblÂ«
qualities and I hope we will g.iva and retain
their affection and their love. - Â¦

Three cheers were given for Jefferson

concluded to speak of myself, but after somÂ«
consideration I made up my mind that that
would be Interesting only to myself. (Laugh

have abandoned this because my friends have
told me to go "way back and take a chair.
Still. I have my Ideas of the Philippines, an4
I have made up ray mind that we would have
been much better off as a nation if we ha-1
never seen the Islands. This is a national sub
ject -which involves not only the r>restiE* but
the honor of the nation. It Is no longer a
theory which confronts us; we have Â»ipon th*>
shoulders of the American people the welfare
and the happiness of 8.C00.00O human beingsOF all the bon-bons that have been
popped during the latter days, of
the season at Oakland, none was
attended with more surprising re
sults than the capture of the Geb
hard handicap for two-year-olds by Gold
Van yesterday.
Where the Mcrris youngster acquired
his t- peed to accomplish the trick will un
doubtedly remain a mystery. The fact re
mains that he was hammered down In the
betting from 20 to 7 to 1, picked up 108
pounds and brought along frcm last posi

In the actual running,, though, he scooled
up perceptibly. Foucon never getting him'
The warm, balmy weather' and" an ex
ceedingly well 'balanced lot of events
drew a big crowd. to the track across the
bay. Naturally enough the stake number
had first call on the affections of specu
lators and betting over the result was
heavy. High Chancellor, carrying top
weight, 119, and ridden by Conley, coupled
with his stable mate, Georgle West, ha,d
a decided call in the betting. Honiton and
Orfeo, the Macdonough pair, came in for
second call. A' tip circulated on Gold Van
caused his odds, to speedily drop "from 20
to 8. To an extent Conley wasi re
sponsible for the defeat of High Chancel
lor. Away none too well at the start, he
succeeded in slipping through on the rail,
taking third position. Â¦â¢ He " then trailed
Honiton and - Sylvia -Talbot into the
stretch, and instead Â«of> coming: on the
outside, tried to split the leaders, or else
get through between Honiton and the
rail. Two or three times he Vwas com
pelled to take his mount back; and while
thus dilly-dallying,- Jackson on? Gold Van
and Daly astride Arabo went thundering
by in the center of .the track.. Jackson

head. Finally getting through with no
more obstacles to encounter, HlgTi Chan

five favorites we>e -toppled over, It would
naturally be supposed , the ring reaped a
rich benefit. Such:' however,: was not the

hit to third, advancing Williams to sec
ond. , Overall batted a high fly out to
right field and Knight dropped it, allow
ing Williams to cross the home plate. It
looked blue for Stanford, but the next
man up sent Cowden a r>op fly. Hatch
was caught at the home plate on trying
to steal in when Cowden threw to first to
coax him to the attempt. Kennedy sent
Copp a pop fly and the side was retired.
The, score remained. 1 to 1 until Cali
fornia won out in the eleventh Inning. In
the sixth Lowenthal lined out a two-bag
ger, but ,two men were already out and
when Kellogg, who had taken Knight's
place, got a hit Lowenthal tried to reach
home and was caught at the plate.

1 jf^ ALIFORNIA won the ' second
ff game of the series and the inter
(1 . collegiate ' championship, defeat
! ing Stanford by a score. of 2 to .1
in an eleven inning contest yes
terday on the Berkeley diamond. The
! game was one of the best exhibitions ever
i seen en a California college baseball field
and excitement was intense throughout
the long struggle for supremacy.
Honors were remarkably even between
the two teams. Each made eleven errors.
California secured eight hits off Parker,
while Stanford could connect with Over
all's curves for but five hits. Overall
; showed his usual skill. Parker pitched
a great game for Stanford. Prior to the
eleventh inning but six hits had . been
:' made, off his delivery. He was cool and
! effective at all stages of the game.
j Few brilliant plays gave trie college
enthusiasts opportunity to go into.trans
ports. The low, close score and the com
i paratively steady play of both teams at,
! all. times held the breathless Interest of
i the spectators.
I A ciean hit to center over shortstop by
Braly in the last half of the eleventh
ended' the agony. Adams had reached
iirst on an error by Blake'and had gone
to second on McGilvray's , passed oall.

I to bat and lined out a drive that clinched
! the championship. A great yell went up
from, the bleachers, crowded with Cali
fornia students, and the demonstrations
of joy of the blue and gold partisans
lu&ted some minutes.
\Evenly Matched Teams. . \
The â¢ score was the best yet made in a

Record Entry of Greyhounds.
The California Coursing Committee,
which has charge of the greynound sec
tion at the forthcoming show, has broken
two records. The members have secured
more than a hundred entries of grey
hounds. This is a greater number than
were ever shown at one time in England
or elsewhere. It Is also the greatest num
ber of entries of one breed ever received
for a show In this city.
SALINAS. April 12.â Floyd, the 10-year-old
son of C. O. Brown, a rancher of Buena Vista,
was terribly lacerated this afternoon by the
explosion of a shotgun. His wounds may prova

PANAMA, Colombia, April 12.â The
Government fleet, which sailed from here
Thursday, returned last night. The gun
boat Chuchuto patrolled the coast to the
Bayamo River, whither 200 men had beea
.vent to bring cattle for the troops. The
Boyaca. went as far as San Carlos with
out meeting any revolutionary vessels.
It is rumored that the revolutionary
General Herrera desired to send to the
Government gome ' communications
through Captain \V. W. Reisinger of tne
United States cruiser Philadelynia. Cap
tain Reismger refused to receive the com
munication, saying he could not accept
thorn because as u representative of tiia
"Liuled States he couid recognize no aii-
Uionty in the district but that of Gover
nor balazar. The captain's conduct is
commended in conservative circles.
The collection of the war tax imposed
by a recent decree was begun to-day. The
houses of all Liberals who have nbt paid
the tax levied upon them are surrounded
by soldiers. Most cf the assessments have
fJready beer, paid, but some or the persons
taxed have joined the revolutionists in
the Held.
A meeting cf the foreign Consuls here
was held this morning to consider whether
anything could be dons to prevent the
Government from collecting the war tax
levied against Consul Boyd of Salvador
BSQ Consul Jesurem of Holland. After
discussion it was decided that the con
sular body could accomplish nothing in
favcr of Boyd and Jesurem.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Artril 12. â The steam
ship Amur arrived this evening from Skagway

RESULTS OF SATURDAY'S EVENTS AT OAKLAND TRACK
ST. PETERSBURG. April 12.â Captain F. L.
H. Stouir. the United States military attache,
is recovering from an attack of inflammation
cf the lungs.
Good baseball Is sometimes like certain
diseasesâ contagious. On Friday thirteen
acts of the high grade article were ren
dered in a becoming manner. Yesterday
the crowd beheld a battle royal, fast and
exciting enough to satisfy the taste of the
most exacting crank who ever said harsh
things about an umpire Â¦ or v drew a rain
check at the box office. -The home team
wonâ a source of much gratification to
the rooters. The score was close, 6 to 5,
and it was either side's game for the ask
ing until the last man was put out.
' H. Kane, who is tall and possessed of a
kangaroo shape, passed them to the Sen
ators for inspection, while Peter Dowlmg,
he of the erratic nature, endeavored to
puzzle the ponies. Kane buffa.oed the
crowd. Every one thought he was lixe
unto the proverbial March hare for w,iid
ness and as easy to rattle as a fat man
looking for his scat in a' theater. The
spectators were mistaken. Kane, while
a little unsteady at times, kept his think
ing box clear and mystified the Senators
in every inning but one. Dqwling also
handled himself with much grace, but a
few coetiy errors at critical points were
his undoing. The score:

ERKELEY, April 12.â The Unl

acrobats and tumblers performed and

peanuts and scattered the shells over

The day was ideal for an outdoor circus
and the venders of lemonade â "nice,

of nickels as the result of the warmth.

ASSAULTS HER CUSTODIAN
In his first decision Judge Ocden al
lowed the County Assessor .ilOO /or the
preparation of these rolls, upon.^. show
ing by Mr. Dalton that work represent
ing this amount of money had been' done
by his deputies outside of the regular of
nce time. Judge Ogden held definitely
that the County Assessor was not en
titled to any fees -whatever, and that he
could only retain from the amount paid
by the city of Oakland for the work ex
actly the value of the work that was done
outside of the office hours of the deputies.
After he looked into the case a little
more he decided that the Assessor was
not entitled to as much as he had allowed
him. and so reopened the case to-day. He
then reduced the allowance from $2100 to
S1335 33. Mr. Dalton made a plea that he
had already paid his deputies $325 out of
what he supposed would be his commis
sion, but Judge Ogden held that this could
not be considered, because, the work was
done in regular office hours, for which the
deputies were paid in full by the county,
and any fees earned by them In this time
belonged to the county.
Acting under Judge Ogden 1 s decision
Mr. Dalton paid into the county treasury
J5G00, and he will now have to add $SO0
mere to this amount. That portion of this
amount which represents the commis
sions on poll taxes was paid under pro
test. Mr. Dalton will contest Judge Og
den's decision upon the poll tax commis
sions and will take it to the Supreme
Court, but will abide by his decision in the
matter of fees from the city of Oakland.
He holds that the portion of the county
government act which relates to Alameda
County is worded differently from that
relating to other counties, and that while
Assessor Dodge of San Francisco is not
entitled to these fees, he is.
This position of Mr. Dalton Is based
upon the fact that the section of the
county government act relating to Ala
meda County was originally drawn so as
to allow him these fees. It was afterward
decided to change the act. allow him more
deputies and remove the fees. To this
end" the word ."not" was inserted in all
the sections referring to the fees, but in
the last section this was omitted through
oversight, and Mr. Dalton claims that
this section being read last was adopted
last and therefore nullifies the rest of the
act in vrhich "not" appears.
Judge Ogden reopened the case to-day^
of the county of Al&xneda against County
Assessor Henry P. Dalton. took a litUe
more testimony upon the cost of getting
up the duplicate assessment rolls for the
city of Oakland, and then ordered Mr.
Dalton to pay about JoOO more into the
county treasury.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Thanks chiefly to the arrival of a num
ber of Americans the price of seats for
the coronation rose by leaps and bounds
this week until to-day a" lively gamble Is
going on. The extent of this can be gath
ered from the fact that early in the week
two Americans paid Â£200 for three small
windows on the Strand and resold' them
for Â£600. In Piccadilly thre bay windows
have gone to an American * purchaser for
3* guineas each. For a corner bay win

These prices are so excessive that there

person. . - â¢ ' â¢ ' *
This alarmingly small allowance has
caused several Dowagers to say that they
will not attend the coronation, for with
the long wait and the heated weather, to
say noihing of the weight of the thick
velvet robes and the coronets, the Abbey
service would be altogether too trying for
middle-aged women, most of whom are
not accustomed to such strains.
The latest device for celebrating the
coronation is an energetic agitation for
lights and bonfires from John O' Groat s to
Land's End. These beacons of rejoicing
will probably be established on a scale
never before attempted in England.
King Edward has expressed very clearly
his wish that money expended in cele
brating his coronation should be devoted
to charitable and philanthropic objects
rather than to mere ostentatious display.
Being informed that Greenwich purposed
commemorating the coronation by raising
funds for a permanent enlargement of the
local hospital, the King informed the bor
ough, through Sir Francis Knollys, the
private secretary of his Majesty, that he
was greatly pleased with the spirit dis
played and that the local charities were
much the best objects for celebration ex
pendltures throughout the kingdom. The
royal wish is likely to have a widespread
result and benefit numberless institutions.

not answer, and then his attorneys will
get him out on habeas corpus and take
the question right up to the Supreme
Court. Next Friday was set as the day
when Donohue will be asked the question
which he refuses to answer.
The question was left in abeyance until
to-day so that Judge Hall could stuay it
up. Attorneys Webb. Chapman and Creed
argued that his are only ministerial pow
ers and Attorney Bosley argued against
them. At the end of an etxended exposi
tion of authorities Judge Hall decided
that a Judge in his individual capacity as
well as the court has power to punish
.refusals to obey his mandates.
Donohue refused to x>bey the summons
to have his deposition taken before Su
perior Judge Hall two weeks ago on the
ground that the court loses its judicial
powers when it sits to take a -deposition,
and his attorneys succeeded in raising a
doubt in the court's mind as to its
powers.
The Supreme Court has already decided
that a notary public has merely minis
terial and not judicial powers, which is
equivalent to denying him the power to
enforce questions or punish for contempt.
This decision was successfully invoked in
the Collins-Enquirer suit, when Editor
G. B. Daniels refused to answer the ques
tions of the Court Commissioner.
Mr. Donohue Is going to make a martyr
of himself in order to help the lawyers
make a test of the laws of the State in
regard to depositions. The powers of
Judges and Justices, Court Commission
ers and notaries are very indefinite touch
ing this subject and the question is about
to undergo the scrutiny of the Supreme
Court, so that some sound definition may
be had.
Hts refusal to answer the questions that
are put to him at a deposition taking may
land Peter B. Donohue, who is suing M.
J. Laymance and others for an account-
Ing of the stock of the California Stand
ard and Giant oil companies, in the
County Jail for a period on account of
contempt. ' -_

The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Fred Begerow. the Alviao constable
who killed Joseph Cech and August Ber
ger at the brewers* picnic in San Jose in
July, 19C0, must again stand trial for mur
der.
Begerow has been on trial five times for
the deed, and each time the jury has dis
agreed. After the last trial, which oc
curred in April, of last year, the defend
ant wa3 kept in jail without steps being
taken by the prosecution, longer than the
time allowed by law. The Supreme Court
ordered, his release. The moment that
he was treed the authorities rearrested
him. and since that time he has been in
confinement at San Jose.
He petitioned the , Supreme Court for
another writ of habeas corpus on the
ground that his release was a bar to all
future. prosecution. The court holds that
his rearreat was legal and that he may
be tried again.

Then a return to the cars and a depar
ture for home, sweet home. An incident
before the starting was the action of
Chief of Police Wittman, who announced
to each of the members of the chapter
who did not appear at the appointed hour
that they were "fined chewing gum for
the crowd." Within ten minutes there
was enough gum at the starting point to
keep the company chewing for a month.
The Chief, who imposed the fines as ' a
jesh, had the tables nicely turned on him
by the host, who arrived five minutes
after the appointed time. As he appeared
the Chief told him that he was fined as
others were and he quietly drew from his
coat pocket two boxes of gum, remark
ing, "I thought' something of the kind
would happen, 'so I came prepared."

/~~"*v N the evening of the 7th of
/\\V\ April Mrs. Baker, grand presi
fl \\ \\ dent of the Native Daughters
IV \\ y of the Golden West, paid an
\^-^y official visit to Minerva Parlor
No. 2. Thero were present a
large number of the members
of Buena Vista Parlor and members of
other parlors, also Mijs Keith, grand vice
president; Miss Frakes, grand secretary,
and Dr. Mariana Bertola, P. G. P. Sev
eral of the officers of the parlor were on
the sick list and their places had to be
fille'd by others. Despite this drawback,
those who filled the chairs performed the
work of initiation in a very creditable
manner, so creditable that the grand offi
cers complimented them for it. Under
good of tlie order Mrs. Baker, who had
given them a lecture on the duties of offi
cers in carrying out their special func
tions, delivered an Interesting talk on
what she called the ideal member of a
subordinate parlor. She was followed by
the grand vice president. Miss Keith,
â¢who, after a few words of compliment
to the officers, said that Minerva Parlor
Is one of the historic parlors of the or
der, being the first one organized in San
Francisco, one in which the membership
had always worked in peace and in har
mony, and in which the members were i
not afraid to stand up for truth, right and
justice as they understood it. She con
gratulated the parlor on having in its
membership "one of the noblest women
of the order, Past Grand President Mary
E. Tillman, who had always stood for the
right, who was absolutely incorruptible,
â¢who would 'swear to her own heart and
change it not,' whose word once given was
Â»evÂ«r recalled." The speaker then paid
a tribute to Mrs. Tillman' s steadfastness
of purpose in her determination to win
recognition for Lily O. Reichling as the
founder of the order of Native Daughters
Â©f the Golden West, that neither lure of
office nor hope of personal gain could
tempt her to desert a cause she felt was
right or true, that she had twice/gone
down in defeat in the Grand Parlor, be
cause she had allied herself to f what
eeefned to be the weaker side â the cause
of Lily O. Reichlingâ against those who
sought to take that honor from her. She
then congratulated the order that through
the efforts of Mrs. Tillman tardy justice
had been accorded to that lady by the
Grand Parlor giving her a life seat in that
body. Miss Frakes on being called spoke
a few pleasant words and thfen Dr. Ber
tola spoke at length upon conversational
Â¦usage among the Native Daughters, and
placed the seal of her approval upon "our
Vigorous English, pure and undefined."
On the night of the 8th inst. there was
a high jinks in the hall of La Vespero
Parlor and there were present a large
number of visitors, among the number
being Grand Vice President Keith, Past
Grand President Mrs. Conrad, who re
cently returned from her former home.
District Deputy Miss Annie Worth, Ag
nes Lunstedt, the organizer of the par
lor, President Shay of Minerva Parlor,
Miss Ryan and Miss McVery of the
beauty parlor. Miss Kerwan and others.
Before the entertainment there was work
and the officers were congratulated by the
grand vice president on their efficiency
and also congratulated the parlor on the
acquisition of a handsome American flag,
on its obedience; of the law in all things.
This, she declared, is the duty .of every
Native Daughter from the highest to the
lowest, none being exempt from its pro
visions. In speaking of the approaching
Grand Parlor session. Miss Keith made a
plea for free and open-handed hospitality
so characteristic of early Californians,
and was vigorous in opposition to what
she desigmated as "any form of entertain
ment that savors of the close corporation
order, but that if entertainment there be,
It should not be for a favored few, but
for all." Mrs. Conrad spoke enthusias
tically of the work of La Vespero, and
told of her visit to Sonora. where her par
lor, Dardanelle, accorded her a rousing
reception. She said that that parlor in
dorses the circular calling for historical
landmarks and the establishing of a
library of California works, and declared
that she will be the one to donate the
first book of it, a work on Tuolumne
County. The others named also addressed
the parlor, after which there was a
sumptuous collation and an impromptu
programme of entertainment.
The visit of Grand President Mrs. Ba
ker to Golden State Parlor No. 50 on the
2d of April was a most pleasant one. The
meeting place was most tastefully deco
rated; in fact, more beautifully than on
any official visit previously made this
term. The principal decoration was the
flower of the State, the golden poppy.
After the work of the evening Mrs. Ba
ker, in one of her eloquent addresses,
congratulated the parlor on the harmony
that prevails in it and congratulated the
officers for the manner in â¢which thev
conducted the parlor and ritualistic work.
President Miss L. Wedel. on behalf of
the parlor, presented to Mrs. Baker as a
reminder of the visit a handsome statu
ette of Spring and a bunch of beautiful
roses, after which Past President Miss
Tillie Ducker presented a large basket
filled with fragrant roses to Mrs. Ella
"Wehe, the district deputy grand presi
dent. There were addresses appropriate
to the occasion by Brother Mariana Ber
tola and Miss Mae B. Wllkins, past grand
presidents.
The visitors at the office of the grand
secretary last week were: Grand Presi

caused by the clashing of the aims of
the two societies, which were entirely
different. She said: "Our society exists
purely because its members Â¦ love flowers,
while the horticulturists desire only to
make money. Although they were our.
Invited giiests, they would --not abide by
our rules. We will not be assisted by the
Horticultural Society In the coming show,
but nevertheless It will be the most suc
ceesful ever given by the Floral Society."
The two committees worked for a time
in harmony, and it was only after the
premium list had been arranged that the
trouble arose. The horticulturists with
cj-cw and determined to hold an exhibi
tion of their own either In June or in
August, when the Knights of Pythias
visit this city. The Floral Society will
hold its regular annual exhibition, but
tbe dates have been changed to May 22,
23 and 2i.

year they decided to invite the horticul

show. The invitation was accepted. The

A serious disagreement has arisen be

The ladies of the State Floral Society
claim that the men of the Horticultural
Society axe imbued with a commercial

THE SA^ FRAXCISCO, CALL, SUNDAY , APRIL 13, 1902:

The. woman who cannot stand it unless her clothes are so loose she
barely feels them, may make up her mind that her feminine organs need
immediate attention. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will put
her in a normal condition, and as a result the figure will resume its natural
proportions. If every woman would # take Mrs. Pmkham's medicine when
her side or back aches, or when she has an uncomfortable, bloated feeling,
we would have fewer slouchy, middle-aged women, who, as they say, cannot
stand moderately tight clothing.- Instead of wearing clothes that are looser
and more slovenly in appearance every day, they might, by the use
of Mrs. Pinkham's medicine, get iheir shapely bodies again. Lydia 12.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will cure the female troubles, will take
away the pain, will relieve the inflammation. I do hope that all women who
are .suffering any of the effects of tight clothing, or who are ill with any
distinctly feminine trouble, will understand how exactly this medicine is
adapted to their needs.
Women suffering from feminine troubles always have a desire to wear
unnecessarily loose clothing. They think it will relieve the pain. They do
not stop to consider that removing the pressure will not cure. The female
troubles get no better, and day after day a little of that trim look, so es-
sential to a woman's best appearance, is lost.
When a woman finds she is beginning to have* pains in her side, when
she gets dizzy from causes she does not understand, when the I bearing-
down pains are so frequent she hardly seems able to walk, let her take
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. It is the only thing that will
help her. There Is no use in her going to the doctor. He has no sympathy
with a woman who. through not understanding, has brought these
troubles upon herself. Half the time he doesn't believe in them, and' puts
a woman off with something that may give her temporary relief, but will
be of no lasting help. But Mrs. Pinkham has made a study of this matter
for years, and her medicine is just the thing that is needed to restore thÂ»
nerves to a healthy condition, relieving and healing the inflammation.
Of course, every young woman who laces too tight realizes sooner or
later that her pains are the result of the tight clothing, and she loosens it,
and then wonders why her pain doesn't cease. She doesn't understand that
the displacement of the female organism is not a trouble that will cure
itself. By and by she says she cannot see that wearing her clothes loosely
helps her any, and she tries to wear them tight once more, but cannot do
so. Often inflammation has set in and enlarged the organs, and the slim
figure that was once her pride is no more. The whole trouble is that the
woman does not know that the mere loosening of the clothing will not cure
the trouble caused by wearing clothes too tight.
But, like the shoe and the glove, in its use the . corset has been much
abused. What should be used merely to give the waistline a trim appear-
ance, often is drawn so tight that displacement of the female organs re-
eults, and causes the woman untold agony. Every one has in her list of ac-
quaintances some one whose wasp-like waist was the pride of her young
womanhood. I know such a person who, when she was going to the theater,
or reception, would draw her corset even a little tighter. By and'by she
began to have pains in the side, which seemed almost unbearable. They
came at first at these evening affairs, when she should have been enjoying
herself; but by and by the pains were always thereâ even when she did
not don the corset at all. She had brought on female trouble by her reck-
lessness, an illness that kept her in misery much of the time. She finally
went to the hospital, and there the nurse told me it was an actual fact that
the various feminine organs had taken an unnatural and deformed shape as
the result of tight lacing.
Bearing-down pains and dizziness, from which so many women suffer,
are often the result of wearing clothing that is too tight.
Tbe shoe and glove, however, when worn too tight/do not make half
the trouble caused by the tight corset In Epite of all that is said to the
contrail', I believe in'the corset, although the slim woman looks much bet-
ter without It. But for the person inclined to be, stout I know the corset
to be a friend indeed. Such a woman is apt to lay on more fat over the
stomach, and if the corset is worn constantly, it keeps the too solid flesh
from accumulating too rapidly.
It is a well-known fact, and a perfectly reasonable one, that the glove
and shoe, if worn too tight, interfere with the proper circulation of the
blood. ... ' '^i^- Â¦ -. â¢. ;' ; ;*

The selection of a pastor to succeed
Donaldson was left to Rev. Dr. Coyle,
who departed > for Colusa Â¦ County imme
diately after the* adjournment. , . ; Â¦>"
The charges against Miss Lorena Evans
and Miss Lottie Bush were then presented
by the elders. ' Thomas Jefferson ' Mize,
one of the trustees, objected, quoting, the
church law to the effect that action could
be taken upon the accusation of but one
person at a single session, but his breth
ren overruled him and the story of the
disgraceful affair of several days ago was
retold. Considerable discussion ensued as
to the proper course to pursue in^view.of
the fact that Miss Bush was not present
to defend herself, but it was finally-or
dered that the secretary write to Miss
Bush, demanding her resignation from
membership in the church, and informing
her that expulsion was the only, alterna
tive. The same action was .taken in the
case of Miss Evans. , ...
Resolved, That whereas- the pastor of the
Methodist Episcopal Church of Vacaville, Rev.
M. V. Donaldson, is . charged with improper
conduct; and whereas, the said charges are
fully proved by reliable witnesses. It Is there
fore ordered that the name or. M. V. Donald
son be stricken from the membership roll, of
this church and that he be dishonorably.ex
pelled as a pastor ol the Methodist Episcopal
church forever. - Â¦Â¦â¢ ..
After listening to the testimony of sev
eral young women, the following resolu
tion was adopted:
When the official board, "composed' of
John Bailey, George Stevens, W, L. Rose,'
W. W. White, T. J. Mize, Mrs. R. J.

Mrs. James Collins . and â¢ Mrs. George
Reams, with Rev. Dr. John Coy le, the
presiding elder, acting as chairman, was
called to order, the cnairman announced
that the purpose of the r meeting was : to
take action on the case of Rev Mr. Don
aldson, who was- charged with conduct
unbecoming a minister of the gospel.
VACAVILLE, April 12.â M. V.; Donald
son was to-night expelled as pastor j of
the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the
resignations of two young women of the
local congregation were demanded. This
action was taken at a meeting of the of
ficial board to-night, and has evoked some
criticism, for the reason that. the accused
young women were given no chance to
reply to the charges. "

Concluding Mr. Dpckweiler proposed a
toast to the memory of the late Stephen
M. White, which was drunk in silence.
The people south of the Tehachapi Pass
have or.e dear wish, and this Is what they
hope: That the leaier of the Democracy will
be selected from their midst to head the Dem
ccrati<- ticket in the next campaign. Mayor
Merf-cith P. Snj-der of Los Angeles is our
ohoict" but no matter who may be selected,
the Democracy of Southern California will
unite with solid ranks and lead him on to vic
tory.
Isidore B. Dockweiler of Los An&eles
responded to the toast "Democracy South
of Tehachapi Pass." The hour teas late
and his remarks were therefore brief. He
launched the boom of Mayor Snyder of
Los Angeles as a candidate for Governor
in the following words:

DEMOCRATS MEETAT FESTAL BOARD
Asks for Resignation.
' WASHINGTON, April 12.â The Secre
tary of "the Treasury has sent a letter to
Assistant Commissioner of Immigration
McSweeney, in New York, calling for his
resignation. The secretary inclosed, the
letter of Cortelyou received by him yes
terday.
CHURCH EXILES
ERRING WOMEN
The men of the two divisions at this
port have asked permission to form a so
cial organization for the purpose of hav
ing entertainments on board ship on other
than drill nights.
The steam launch of the naval militia
has been put in first-class condition pre
paratory to cruising on the bay on Deco
ration day and firing salutes in memory
of the soldier and sailor dead. .
In a short time the men of the division
iocated at this point will be sent out in
the steam launch and be required to-prac
tice firing from a one-pounder in the bow
of the vessel at a target on Red Rock.
The corps has a membership of eighty
at this time, with prospects of increase to
104 before three months. Surveying in
struments have been secured and* will : be
used in the instruction of the men. For
the present the uniform will be the kahkl.
Target Practice for Naval Militia.
The commanding officers of batteries, in
the" First Battalion of Artillery have been
directed to instruct their men in tnat part
of the gun drill that can be taught in the
armory. In a short time the men will be
taken to some point where they can drill
with siege guns. Arrangements to that
end are now under consideration.
The engineer corps that was organized
some time since in this city*with the idea
of attaching the same to the First Infan
try Hegiment so as to form a three bat
talion organization, but which was not
recognized by the superior officer at Sac
ramento on the ground that there was no
provision of law for such an organization,
and, further, that there was no vacancy
to which the board of location could as
sign it, has determined to remain in ex
istence nevertheless. It organized perma
nently a few evenings since by electing
the following officers and "non-coms' :
Major "W". A. Disbrough. captain; Barton
Cruikshank, first lieutenant; J. B. Thom
as, secend lieutenant; L. McKinley, first
sergeant; John Wait, second sergeant,
and Waid Dwight Jr., first duty sergeant.
The corps has decided to continue as an
organization at the expense of the mem
bers in the hope that-the next Legislature
will recognize it. In the meantime the
owner of Columbia Hall, at Page and
Stanyan streets, has tendered the organi
zation the free use of a room 25x62 feet
as a meeting place and drill room' free of
charge for a number of months.
Gun Drill Instruction.
"At the election Jn Company C of the
First Infantry, N. G. C..' last' week Fran*
K. Moore was re-elected captain by unan
imous vote. This company is well known
to the public through its numerous exhi
bitions and is credited with being one of
the best drilled in this city. In the old
organization it was known as Company I,
and as such was in service in the Philip
pines with the First California Volun
teers. Captain Moore,. who is a very pop
ular member of the guard, served '- in
Light Battery A, Second Artillery, also
in Battery C of the same organization.
He was elected second lieutenant of Com
pany I, First Infantry, in April, 1S9S. The
following month he was commissioned in
the same grade in the First California. In
August following he was promoted to
tirst lieutenant in the Philippines, and in
September, 1899, was mustered out of the
United States service at the Presidio. In
June, 1901, he was commissioned captain
of Company C, and he will now have his
commission renewed. \ .
WASHINGTON, April ;12.-The House
to-day passed the bill granting a pension
to the widow of President McKinley of
$5000 a year.' .It had previously passed the
Senate and now goes to the President for
signatured ' . Â¦
Although' favorable action' on the meas
ure was unanimous, an inqulrx, by Bell
of Colorado as to the precedents for such
action. led to an animated discussion. Bell
contended that many- widows., of poor sol
diers were without pensions and that Mrs.
McKinley Â¦ had independent means, mak
ing a pension unnecessary. . â¢:Â«.-.'
Grosvenor of Ohio severely criticized
Bell's position. Richardson of -Tennessee
and several other : Democratic .members
spoke for the bill as in the line of .prece
dent, ' Kleberg of Texas, an ex-Confeder
ate soldier, supporting it on the ground
that President McKinley had wiped out
the last vestige of sectionalism.
The day was devoted to private pension
bills, 177 being passed.

NEW YORK, April 12. â The Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
"There was more talk than actual business
In the market to-day. The Cabinet met on
urgent summons. This gave rise to divergent
rumors, some reporting' a Cabinet .crisis, and
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach wanted to raise the
income tax and Joseph Chamberlain insisted en
a fresh war lean, threatening his resignation
unless his plan was adopted. The latest ru
mor is that the Bank of England representa
tives have been in conference with the Chan
cellor of the Exchequer. This, if true, sug
gests a new loan, but all are awaiting the of
ficial confirmation of such a step. Americans
were generally above parity, but Louisville and
Nashville was under, with apparently free
dealings. Rto Tlntos were % up, on the rise

The Financier eays: The official statement
cf the New York associated banks for last
week showed a net gain in cash of $108,000,
specie having decreased $1,258,400 and legal
tenders increased $1,306,400. This net gain
very nearly corresponds with that which was
estimated on the basis of the traceable move
ments of money during the week this estimate
being a gain of $292,400 by the banks. The
comparatively slight difference of $184,400 be
tween the estimated and the official gain may
be accounted for by the system of averages
which affected the interior bank movement
and the export , gold movements to Europe.
The loans showed a decrease of $6,841,600, in
dicating that there must have been consider- !
able calling in of loans by the banks, caused
by efforts to rectify their position as regards
reserves. It is noteworthy that the surplus
of the banks as shown by the statement of
April 5 was the lowest ! since November 18
1899, when the banks indicated a deficiency
of $312,025. Doubtless it was owing to this
fact that the banks generally sought, through
a reduction of loans, to restore reserves/ for
had there been an expansion in this item the '
loss of gold, which was foreshadowed early
last week and which was reflected in the re
duction of $l,2E8,4C0 specie shown by the state
ment would most likely have carried the banks
very close to the limit of 25 per cent of re
serve to deposits. There was a decrease of
$7,256,900 in deposits last week. Though the
loss of loans, less the net gain in cash, calls
for a change of $6,733,000 In this item the
difference of $523,300 may be regarded as un
important. The Â¦ required reserve was reduced
to Â¦ $1,714,225, consequently the net eain of
$108,000 in cash caused an increase in reserve
of $1,922,223. This item now stands at 54,
.751,750, against $7,036,200 at the corresponding
period a year ago. The deposits of public
funds in banks of this city, which will be made
during the current week, will increase the
cash reserves- and at the same time they will
diminish the drain of money into the sub
treasury, these deposits being made through
the diversion from the sub-treasury 1 into the
banks of current collections of Internal revenue.

the parties in interest as to the actual condi
tions existing in the stock added to the un
certainty. The plausible theory advanced was
that advantage had been taken of the strength
of the stock to market the newly authorized in
crease cf $5,000,000 of stock. The formality
of application and listing of a new stock issue
on the Stock Exchange requires about a
month's time. Meantime the new stock is not
a good delivery against pales made on the
Stock Exchange. It was supposed that the
bpeculative pool in the stock had discovered
this technical short interest In the market, and.
by forcing up the price, was compelling the
delivery of stock held for control, thus threat
ening the absorption of the control. The an
nounced purpose to apply a portion of the
new Etock issue to the purchase of the Atlanta,
Knoxville and Northern revealed an incursion
into the territory of the Southern Railway
Company. There were conjectures that control,
of a road into Chicago running north of the
Ohio River also was sought. Coupled with the
enormous dealings in the stock, these facts and
surmises gave color to the supposition of a
contest for control, and the activity and
strength in Southern Railway, as though in
sympathy, seemed a corroboration. The an
nouncement of the purchase of the Choctaw,
Oklahoma and Gulf and the supposition that
It was in the Interest of the Rock Island was
additional incentive to credulity In the pro
gress of plans for extension of community of
interest' and strengthening of position by exist
ing railroad systems, by control of outlets and
extension. The activity and strength of the
Gould stocks were supposed to be due to the
progress of plans .for completing the system's
outlet to the Atlantic coast. It is a matter
of observation that practically all of the rail
road construction of the present era of indus
trial activity is devoted to extension and
strengthening of existing systems rather than
to the formation of new systems. It is argued
that this tends to insure against rivalry and
destructive competition. The postponement of
the British budget statement defers the clear
ing up of the foreign money situation. The
announcement on good authority that Russia
will seek no further loan in Europe this year
removes an apprehension that the recent loan
placed in Germany, Belgium and Holland was
merely preliminary to a large Russian loan to
be floated.
The speculation In stocks has been supple
mented by an active buying of come of the
low grade- speculative bonds, on which Interest
payments are contingent at sharp advance in
price.

CHICAGO, April 12.â Interest in corn easily
outran ' all else of a ' speculative nature. * The
gradual advance of . the. past .week, seemed to
have been : preparing : the ; country [ for decisive
action in this market.- The depleted stocks in
tho Southwestern ; marts '; had given St.: Louis
and Kansas City good* argument for advancing
markets and to-day when the cable list showed
strong and the Southwest was still stronger
and was bidding eagerly . at the relatively
cheaper article in this market, prices respond
ed with vigor. Receipts were s light and . the
belief was common-' among traders that stocks
at St. Louis and Kansas City had â¢ been re
duced to such an extent that those places must
supply their actual demands in Chicago. . May
closed very strong, l%c higher at 61%c. ' -
Â¦ Wheat was inclined to: lag early because of
precipitation in the winter belt. Cables were
strong and receipts - light, but May opened \i
<Â§>%c to.%@Uc lower at 72% Â©72% c. Reports
received from the Southwest, however, . stated
that wheat was not improving with the rains,
the subsoil being so dry 'that such moisture as
had been supplied since spring had disappeared
-without affording the necessary relief to.veg
etation. Acceptances abroad over night were
moderately good. An estimate that the winter
crop would be only three-fourths of that of a
year ago, which was made by a trustworthy
authority, was given credence by many and was
a rotcnt factor in the upturn. May wheat ad
vanced to 73&c, closing firm %@%c up at
73&C. . - ' - ;
Oats dimly reflected the strength in corn.
May closed firm, %c higher at 42c. .-.
, A growing bullish situation in the hog mar
ket started provisions higher again. May
pork closed 12%c higher, lard 7%@10c up and
ribs 10c higher. - Â¦Â¦ . .'
By a ballot of 642 to 140 members of the
Board of Trade to-day made the new grade of

STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 12. â The situation cen
tering about Louisville and Nashville was the
eubject of keen interest In Wall street to-day*>
and kept the market feverish and unsettled.
The Jumps of over 10 points In Chicago and
Eastern Illinois and the rise In Evansvllle and
Terre Haute revived rumors of projects for a
Chicago outlet for Louisville and the confer
ences in progress and known to the street
strengthened the impression of an Impending
parting control of Louisville and Nashville it
self. There was a renewal of the activity
and strength In Colorado and Southern, which
was attributed to the working out of plans fcr
the extension of the Rock Island connections,
Indicated by the purchase of the Choctaw,
Oklahoma and Gulf. Otherwise the principal
etrenerth was in specialties. The buoyant rise
of Canadian Pacific to 120, with a relapse of
a. point, was not explained. The strength of
the various rubber stocks was due* to reports
of proposed mergers, as were the movements
In Virginia-Carolina Chemical and Cotton OH.
The rise of over 4 points In International
Power was due to the expectation of stock
eubscription rights. The strength of the mar
ket was not general acd the advance after the
bank statement was met by realizing, so that
the closing was irregular. The cash changes In
the bank statement conformed closely to the
estimates. The loan decrease was larger even
than hoped Tor. but the knowledge that large
loans were transferred to the trust companies
and to foreign lenders, left the. outlook for
money by no means clear. â¢
There was a re*narkably feverish and erratic
stock market this week, which is attributed In
Wall street to the speculative operations of a
group cf wealthy men who have realized great
fortunes in the. iron and eteel trade and who
were controlling factors in the constituent
companies of tho United States Steel Corpora
tion before the formation of that concern. The
upward course of prices which was estab
lished last week was Interrupted on Monday
by the fsars of money stringency. The large
exports of gold for Tuesday'* steamer threat
ened a total wiping out of the surplus reserve
of the bank*, which was cut down two-thirds
as a result of the transactions of last week.
The rise in the money rates ehut off further
gold exports and made.it profitable for foreign
bankers to negotiate heavy loans in foreign
money markets to place here. The trust com
panies aleo were large lenders at the higher
level, aÂ« they are not subject to the came
legal restriction as to the maintenance of the
cash reserve and are thus able to leave their
cjtih en deposit with the banks to figure in
their cash reserves, while taking up the bank*'
loan. Thiis feature cf the local credit eitua- i
tion has been the cause of tome comment and
criticlt-m in connection with the active specu
lation which is fostered by the resources thus
made available. i
The money market haÂ«. nevertheless, been
unfcettled e.U week and subject to occasional
flurries. The leaders of the speculation seem
Â»to be unaffected by these flurriea and it is
believed- they are protected by heavy loans ou
time. It was suspected that the early unsettie
ment ot money was due partly to the taking
<-ut cf large time leans In this interest
The center cf the speculation shifted
this we<>k from St. Paul and the Western group
to the Southern Railway field. The movement
in Louisville and Nashville became eo sensa
tional that the fear arose that the circum
stances of the Northern Pacific corner la*t
May might be repeated. The reticence of all

COAL AND IRON.
The production of coal and iron measures
the growth of modern civilization everywhere.
It is easy to predict the future of a country
rich in the two minerals, which stand for
energy and strength. The great Northwest has
leaped into prominence as the home of the
precious metals, so-called. - The crowds have
passed unnoticed the timbered areas, the vast
coal measures and iron deposits of Washington
and British Columbia for the glittering but
elusive srizes locked In the ice and snow oX
-faraway Nome and the Klondike. :*>â¢Â«*;
AIMS OF THE COMPANT.
I The wants of this growing country are- the
opportunity of the Tacoma Company. Its plans
look to nothing less than meeting the Western
demand for Iron and steel.
The total consumption of iron on the Paclflo
Coast already amounts to over 3000 tons daily.
Let as ask what the demand will be five years
hence, with the population more than doubled
and the commerce of the Pacific ours. At the
present time. the freight charges .on Iron from
the East, the source of all of our supplies, is
$10 to $18 per ton. This single Item means s>
clear, additional gain on every ton that tha
company., will manufacture.
COAL AND COKE. IRON AND STEEL.
The work planned for the Tacoma Company
may be stated in a line: It will bring to-
gether.- at a point on Puget Sound already
selected, the coal and Iron found abundantly
on its properties. It will mine coal; but
marketing coal ls not the end of , the com-
pany's business. Its abundant coal supplies
will be turned into coke; but neither ls ths
manufacture and sale o* coke the end sought
Â¦The coke ls one step, and only one. in the
process of manufacturing finished Iron pro-
ducts. On the one hand we control *>*\* a
dozen great coal fields, carrying limitless quan-
tities of the best coking coal and located with-
in thirty-five miles of tidewater. And we are
In close touch with the railroad companies,
which insures the lowest transportation rates.
Our iron mines are so fortunately situated that
their products will be carried In chutes to ths
barges which convey It to the company's works.
Railroads can never bleed us with excessive
charges. Our ores and the reduction worta
are both located on tidewater and we shall
own . the ships which convey the ore to the
place of treatment. Our coal properties again
are so near the company's works that a short
and Inexpensive electric line will furnish our
own transportation from mine to tidewater
should the necessity for it arise.
FINISHED PRODUCTS THE AIM.
WÂ«. have already ore In practically limitless
quantities. The ore, besides being of the high-
est grade. Is self-contained, so far .as the
operations of the furnaces are concerned. It
contains only ' traces of sulphur and is free
from titanium. By the addition of small
quantity of hematic, found abundantly upon
the holdings of the company this ore ls self-
fluxing, and the quality of the iron thus pro-
duced is pronounced by expert authorities equal
to the best Swedish. We shall doubtless sell
pig iron, but this, no more than the sale of
coal and coke, is the goal of the great en-
terprise we are Inaugurating. The pig Iron
will go to the markets of the world in the
shape of rails and bars and trusses and all
the multifarious forms In which iron is de-
manded in modern life.
BUSINESS REALITIES. i>
The Idea ls planted in business realities.
More than ten years ago the far-slgHtea men
now at the head of the Tacoma Company be-
gan putting together the great coal and iron
areas- which "are now the property of the com-
pany. -It already has â¢ secured coal " and iron
sufficient for its Â¦ needs for years to come. It
has at Its command great capital and more
important than alt its management represents
the highest business talent and private wealth.
Seen thus the Tacoma is something more than
a company. It is. in fact a movement anal-
agous to the great United States Steel Cor-
poration or the Standard Oil Company.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.
The development of this great enterprise
means the buildins of a great industrial com-
munity. The company realizes all this and Its
far-reaching plans extend to matters incidental
to the general scheme outlined above. Ths
growth of, this community means greatly en-
hanced land values at the seat of the com-
pany's operations and corresponding profit.
We are not prepared now to go at length Into
this branch of our subject It is sufficient
here to say that the company will absolutely
control the site of this community of its own,
creation. ' The Inevitable rise In values thÂ«
unearned Increment, will inure to the stock-
holders of the company. The profits of ths>
factories, stores, shops and bank so necessary
,to community life will all go to swell the
dividends of the parent company.
* MANAGEMENT.
In the prospectus will be found condensed
sketches of the lives and business relations
of the officers of the Tacoma Company. In an
especial degree the success of a mining enter-
prise depends on the character. Integrity and
business ability of the men in charge. The
position and standing of these gentlemen in
business life are a sufficient guarantee of hon-
est and efficient administration. Soine eight
great dividend-paying enterprises, including
mines, banks, collieries and lumber companies,
stand to the credit of these gentlemen. ThÂ«
Tacoma Company will be their ninth.
SUCCESSFUL MEN.
These men have all been successful. Thar
have the fullest knowledge and experience of
mining and the broader walks of business life.
Their reliability has been attested in a thou-
sand relations. Their talents and energies
have been placed unreservedly at thÂ» disposal
of the company.
Take the advice of one whose great fortune
came to him largely through Investments: "I
never invest except with successful men. Show
me an investment in which successful men
are Interested and pushing and I go it blind."
SOURCES ( OK PROFIT.
This company had at its lnceotion and be-
fore a single share of stock had been placed
on the market a great aggregation of Tery
valuable properties. These In many cases are
now productive. Properties like the Marble
Bay holdlnga insure dividends at once. This
mine Is a dividend-payer now and has been
ever since It was first opened. Our great coal
and Iron Interests also only await the installa-
tion of machinery, as fully planned, to main
large profits and corresponding dividends cer-
tain. These dividend-makers may be concisely
pointed out as follows;
I.â The Immense deposit of high-grade Iron
at Redonda and Texada mines.

Â»â¢ â Coal . and coke from the various Hay-
ward properties â 4000 acres.

A RUPTURE truss with steel springs has
been used for 100 years without change: few
cures have been made with such trusses; is
it cot time for a change? Hunter's Ltver
Rupture Holder has revolutionized the anti-
quated truss and has .made It possible to
make a cure In 90 days. The holder is worn
night and day without torturing; a continu-
ous pressure is maintained during the granu-
lation and growth of the tissue covering the
breach; would a wound, on the bedy
heal if a hard pad was bound on it? Never.
Has it not . the same effect -on a rupture?

' Garrett claims to know no motive for
the assault and says he cannot explain
the remark of the assailant when the
first blow was delivered.
Garrett for a reason not explained re
quested that the man who saved him
lrcm further fnjury should be detained
t:ntil he could swear to a comp.aint
agrainst him. and Seymour agreed to do
this.
Hansted helped the battered man into a
neighboring barber shop and summoned
a. -physician. Dr. O'Brien gave temporary
relief to the sufferer, and later he was
removed to his hotel and put to bed- He
had received a cut on the mouth which
Fpat both lips and severe contusions and
bruises on the face and head. His In
juries are not at all serious, and he will
be able to resume business in a day or
two.
He continued to rain blows on Garrett's
face until the latter sank to the sidewalk,
and then attempted to kick the prostrate
man. Fred Hansted. who was standing at
a cigar stand near by, interfered and
threatened to take part in the affray
himself if further violence was attempted.
Another man. evidently a friend of the
assailant, stood by, and when Hansted in
terposed the assailant and his friend ran
throug-h the Turkish bath establishment.
From there it is not known what course
they took.
Garrett was on his way from the Hotel
Savoy, where he resides, to his office, and
had reached a point on Post street In
front of the Turkish baths when a well
dressed man stepped up to him and dealt
him a heavy blow in the face, saying at
the same time:
"I'll teach you to Insult my sister, you
<!irty dog."
â¢Thomas Garrett of the Evening Post of
this . city was assaulted about 9 o'clock
yesterday morning on Post street, near

ing; of. pastofQcers of various; groves to
look into matter, but the committee
became ' powerless because of the â¢ failure
and refusal ; of the , members of - Olympia
Grove: to meet the .committee.
The trouble commenced at a meeting of
Olympia Grove held' in January, 'when J.
H. : Heath . arose and asked permission to
examine > the boote \ of ' the grove ' for the
purpose of ascertaining . what had become
of .the ; funds.' J Ho . was , refused and .was
promptly ; fined Â¦. for persisting. The ' fine
was ' subsequently' remitted, ; but V Heath
was not satisfied. He appealed to Go
deau 1 in. a letter 1 signed by. himself, E*
Dasse and'H. D. Nienhaus, and an inves
tigation was ordered. . Heath claimed that
his name and that of J. H. Nickels, which
appeared; ins the semi-annual -report -of
Olympia Grove's finances, were forgeries,
and stated that * on this account he : de
sired'to inspect the 'books. Â¦
. Now that the battle has begun : inter
esting-developments .are 1 expected, , as in
the -complaint filed ; yesterday forgery,
disrespect to \ superior" officers : and many
other . unf raternal ; charges are "made. ;

The ceremony yesterday at the foundry
was simple but impressive. Principal
Biedenbach was in charge of the < BerKe
ley teachers and children, and the visitors
assembled at the foundry shortly after 2
p. m.' While the workmen were busily en
gaged in preparing for the casting Mayor
Schmitz arrived and was given a hearty
welcome by the children. The clay model
of the bust of President. McKinley, was
displayed, and all who viewed ;it, com
mented on the life-like expression brought
out by the sculptor. /%g$a?&
Sculptor Robert I. Aitken . was commis
sioned to design the bust . of i the Presi
dent, and the ' contract for the casting
was given to the Globe Brass and Bell
Foundry, at 126-128 Main street,/ San
Francisco. Â» 'Â¦3gifln&8*'<?*SEg*ek -.: ' f Â¦ - '
Shortly after the death of the late Pres
ident the citizens of Berkeley . were asked
by, Principal Charles Lr Biedenbach of the
McKinley School to subscribe to a fund
for the purpose of erecting a tribute, to
the dead President. The "children of the
school lent valuable assistance to their
teachers, and with but little delay enough'
money -was. forthcoming .to insure the
purchase of a monument. .
A life-sized bronze bust of â¢ the lato
President William McKinley was ; cast
yesterday afternoon in. this, city in the
presence of the teachers and 100 school
children of the" McKinley School,^Berke

the crucible over a* small opening. The
white-hot metal ran into the mold, while
fantastic colors played around the J hot
stream and jets of gases spouted upward
like a miniature volcano. Although the
mold will not be opened until to-morrow
morning, the visitors were informed that
the casting had been successful in every
way. The bust- will be placed on a shaft

Uiough they were, constrained him to remain in this city? He straSe? alS! eÂ¥n
comparative obscurity in a position of some responsibility in the street car fer"
vice until the attention of the Baltimore syndicate was attracted to him Two
weeks ago he knew no more of the good fortune that awaited him than any othe?
