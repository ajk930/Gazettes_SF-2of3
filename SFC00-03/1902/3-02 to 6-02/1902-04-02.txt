WASHINGTON, April 1â Senator Hari
na's plan for clemency for Estes G. Ratn
bone, convicted In connection with the
Cuban postal frauds, has met with a firm
refusal from President Roosevelt. It Is
said the President told Hanna if he had
the power he would double the punish
ment of both Neely and Rathbone.
Roosevelt's position has chagrined the
Ohio Senator, and a split between them
is predicted. Hanna believes Rathbone- is
the victim of r. conspiracy.
The reported ; pardon of Edward P.
Thompson, former Postmaster at Havana,
according to information given out at the
White House, has no bearing on the
Neely or Rathbone case. In fact, noth
ing is known either at the White 'House
or the War Department concerning
Thompson's pardon, although it is ad
mitted Governor Wood has full power in
the matter.

to carry on the work of extension. This,
in his opinion, would require the employ
ment of twenty-five deputies at a month
ly salary of $(5 each, with- railroad fare
added, which would entail a cost of about
$30,000 a year. In his report the; grand
master paid a compliment to Grand Re

Eloise, ; who was in "another' room, hear

matter, and as she entered Lane shot her
in the abdomen. She fell and he thought
he had killed her.
-Without ever attracting . the attention
of the other servant, who was ironing In
the kitchen, Lane went to the front door
and called in Madeline, who was skating
on roller skates , on the sidewalk. He
told her that her mother wanted her on
the third floor, and without the slightest
suspicion of the .tragedy that was being
enacted she climbed the stairs without
removing her skates. She went into a
room adjoining that in which her mother
lay dead. Lane followed her, and as she
cheerily called her mother the negro shot
her through the heart. . l . .^
Lane made. a full confession. He is the

Indies to the United States conferred with
him and brought to his attention the
Christmas report. Chairman Dalzell asked

Senator -Bacon closed the. Incident by
saying that he would not press the" reso

The investigation of the charges made
in connection with the purchase was be
gun before the special committee ap
pointed by Speaker Henderson. Besides
the members of the committee there was
present Niels Gron. who brought the
charges to the attention of Representa
tive Richardson, and quite a number of
interested spectators.
Investigation in Committee.
Senator Bcccn was interrupted fre
quenuy by Republican Senators, and wh.en
he took nis eeat there were several" of
them on the floor ready to respond to his
suggestion. They agreed to. a man that
the Senate was not called on to take any
action under the '^circumstances, saying
that the charges had not been made pub
lic and were not known when the treaty
was ratified; that the President could be"
depended upon to perform his duties with
out ary hint from the Senate, and that
tne House investigation probably very
soon would dex-elop that the charges were
based upon nothing. They expressed re
gret that any charges had been made, but
said they saw no reason why the eale ct
the islands should not proceed.
Senator Cullom, as chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, said that
the treaty had received careful considera
tion and that there was general . agree
ment to the effect that the United States
from both a strategic and economic stand
point had done well in acquiring them.
Senator Ix>dge. also of the Committee on
Foreign Relations, and other Republican
members took the same position.
Senator Nelson spoke with more feeling
than most other Senators, saying that he
did not consider that the charge, originat
ing, as it did originate, with persons who
were unknown to the Senate, were worthy
of that body's serious consideration. In
his opinion to take any such step as. was
contemplated by the resolution under the
circumstances would be an insult to the
Government of Denmark. ; ..--Â¦ .â¢â¢

-WASHINGTON, 'April Lâ The , Philip
pine civil government bill, as framed by
the 'Republican ' members of the House
Insular Committee, was presented to the
full committee 'at a meeting to-day. The
bill differs in many respects from tha. bill
just completed- by the- Senate Philippine
Committee chiefly in the-fotlowing point?:
A complete plan of civil government,
with a Legislative Assembly, including a
lower house elected by the people, ts pro
vided by the House bill, to go into effect
when permanent peace \s certified by tS->
Governor to the President to have been
established.:.and "after the completion of
a census.' ." ,
'/The ; House measure also adopts the
coinage plan recommended by the Philip
pine Committee and by Conant, who in
vestigated the subject for the War De
partment, making the gold dollar the unit
of, value. In 'addition -the bill providw
elaborate mining, timber and franchise
sections, and also sets forth a declara
tion of rights as a basis of citizenship.
The. committee will, meet again to-mor
row, and Chairman . Cooper expects to
hold continuous /sessions, so as to report
the bill by the end of this week.
The Democratic, members of the In
sular Committee have about agreed upon
the main features of a substitute bill.
This differs considerably from the substi
tute proposed by ,the. Democratic Senp
ators. It contemplates ultimate independ
ence of the islands, this Government re
serving such coaling stations or naval
bases as may be necessary. The with
drawal of the United States troops is con
templated as soon as a native police es
tablishment is in operation. It Is not ex
pected that the House Democratic substi
tute will provide for a repayment to tha
United States of the J20.000.000 paid Spain,
as provided in the Senate Democratic bill.

WASHINGTON, April 1.â An agreement
was reached by the Senate to-day to vote
on' the pending oleomargarine bill betora
adjournment next Thursday. Debate on
the measure was continued throughout
to-day's . session. Heitfeld of Idaho op
pesed. the bill because he believed that It
proposed to drive the . oleomargarine ' in
dustry to. the wall. Gallinger of New
Hampshire advocated the bill because, ho
said, if was a protest against fraud and
against an industry "which {depended for
its success unon duplicity and dishon
esty."- . i â¢
Spooner of Wisconsin made an extended
legal" and constitutional argument in sup
port of the measure. He maintained that.
Congress had the constitutional . right to
tax oleomargarine and Â¦ he . supported the
measure because he believed .such a .tax
was in the Interest of the people. Dis
cussing the coloring of oleomargarine,- he
said: *fS*&Cx*j&t3B&$~Wr- -s . - Â¦Â¦.--.<.
Â¦Â¦ "The most impudent proposition I ever
heard is that of the hog and. steer butter
makers that they discovered the butter
color. You may color butter as. you please
and- it is still butter, and you may color
oleomargarine as you please, and It is
still not butter."
-Bailey of :Texas began a speech 4n op
position, to the pending measure, consid
ering the bill especially In its legal aspect
and in its relation to questions of fact.
.The. House to-day made rapid- progress
with the sundry civil appropriation . bill,
completing ninety-three of the one hun
dred and twenty-nine - pages of the bill.
Efforts to amend the bill were success
fully defeated as a rule by Cannon, chair
man of the Appropriations . Committee,
who was personally in charge of the
measure. ' ...Â¦'.'
. Sulzer of^New York offered an amend
ment to appropriate 550,000 for lighting
the torch of Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty
in New York harbor. . Sulzer said this
light was put. out March 1. Since the
statue was erected in lSSfy'imtil now, he
said, the sundry civil bill Vad always car
ried an appropriation for^his light. When
Sulzer . concluded Cannon ; congratulated
him on the speech and then asked him' if
he withdrew. his amendment. Sulzer re
plied In the negative, whereupon Cannon
said that the pending bill carried Jl.900,000
for lights, the. expenditure of which, he
said, was entirely within the discretion
of the lighthouse board. Cannon said tho
Appropriation Committee had made some
investigation and had ascertained that
the light on the - Bartholdi statue was
valueless for commercial purposes. On a
rising, vote the; amendment was carriedâ
43 to 33. Some New - York schoolteachers
in the gallery applauded, vociferously.
Cannon â¢â¢ immediately, demanded tellers.
"You will have to carry- this by tellers
and an aye and- no vote before it is finally
adopted," he declared emphatically. Great
interest was taken in the vote by tellers.
The page? scurried out to the restaurant
and committee rooms to bring in. ab
sentees.. When the vote was finally com
pleted the first vote was reversed and tho
amendment was defeatedâ 61 to 67.

Â¦ The strike was ordered not for an ad
vance in wages, but because General Man

burg Coal and Iron Company has refused
to sign the agreement of the miners and
operators at Altoona last week.
ALTOONA, April 1.â After a mass meet
ing of the Rochester and Pittsburg. Coal
and Iron Company's miners was held at
Punxsutawney and Sykesville to-day,, the
threatened strike was formally declared.
It involves .10,000 miners and will have
the effect of curtailing the employment
of nearly as many more railroad men em
ployed by thÂ« Buffalo, Rochester and
Pittsburg' Railroad Company, - whose
freight traffic will be nearly paralyzed in
consequence of the strike. Pumpers and
track layers will be permitted to continue
at work to protect the mines. It was de
cided by vote, however, that If General
Manager Robinson should attempt to evict
the strikers from their homes, many of
which are owned by the company, the
pumpers and track layers will also be
called out and the mines allowed to flood.
Any attempt to import other miners will
be resisted. The strikers have assurance

Dr. Manuel A. Sanclemente was* elected
President of Colombia in November, 1898,
and Dr. J. M. Marroquin was elected Vice
President. In August, 1900, it was official
ly announced from Bogota that Sancle
mente, being physically and mentally un
able to exercise the duties of President,
and his indefinite absence from the capi
tal on account of his poor health having
made impossible the regular progress of
affairs, which encouraged and prolonged
the civil war, the~people of Bogota pub
licly demanded that Marroquin, the Vice
President, should assume the reins of gov
ernment, which the latter eventually did
in the same month.* From that t.me on
various reports in 4>nnection with the
President and the Vice President of Co
lombia have been in circulation, the gen
eral belief being that Sanclemente was
practically a prisoner at Villeta.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 1â The lifeless body of
Benjamin Jones, a prosperous mechanic of
Portland, Or., is In the morgue. Coroner
Hoye believes that when the circum
stances of the man's death are revealed it
will be found that he was murdered with
poison. . ' .
Jones was apparently in perfect health
last evening-, but within the brief period
of eighteen hours an unknown woman, for
the time supposed to be his wife, met him
in his room, remained a few hours and de
serted the man in the throes of death. She
disappeared in a manner which lends
color to the only theory which Coroner
Hoye will entertainâ that of murder for
the purpose of robbery.
The details of the case are exceedingly
meager, owing to the fact that Jones reg
istered under the name of. J. H. Sacio. had
been in the city only since Friday and dis
armed the management of the Hotel York,
where the tragedy r occurred, by an
nouncing as his wife the woman now sup
posed to have been connected with his
sudden death.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the woman
came from room 33, occupied by Jones, an
nounced that he was seriously ill and left
the corridor, after impressing the land
lady with the idea that she had gone for a
physician. She was not seen again. A
few moments afterward the hotel at
taches found Jones staggering about the
room and summoned Dr. Clark. He ar
rived promptly, diagnosed the case as one
cf poisoning and ordered Jones removed
to Providence Hospital, where he died at
7 o'clock to-night. *

ALBANY, N. Y., April 1.â The question
cf whether or not members of a labor

mined in the affirmative by the Court of
Appeals to-day In a decision handed^down
in the case of .the National Protective

James Cummin: and Patrick J/ Du*. as
treasurer of the Enterprise Association,

Ihe court is divided in its decision, the
privilege opinion being written by Chief
Justice Parker and concurred In by
Judges Gray, O'Brien and Caight. It Is
dissented from by Judges Bartiett, Mar
tin and Vann. In his opinion, Judge
Parker holds:
It is not the .duty ef one man to work for
another unless he has agreed to, and if he has
so agreed. to, but for no tlxed period, either
may end a contract whenever he chooses. The
one may work -or refuse to work at will and
the other may hire or .discharge at will. . "World
insrmen have the right to organize ror the pur
pose of securing higher wages, shorter hours
of labor or improving their relations with
their employers. They have the right to strike,
provided the object is not to gratify malice or
inflict Injury upon others, Â¦ but to secure bet
ter terms of employment for - themselves. A
peaceiul and orderly strike is not In violation
of the law. A body of men who have or
ganized for purposes deemed beneficial to them

If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root is what you need, you can

Dr. Kilmer's, Swamp-Root, and the address. Binghamton. N. Y.. on every bottle.
EDITORIAL NOTEâ If you have the slightest symptoms of kidney or bladder
trouble, or if there is a trace of it in your family history, send at once to Dr Kil-

Miss Alice Brown, the well-known trained nurse. Is In a position to speak with
knowledge. She was formerly with the St. Louis Baptist Hospital and has had
many trying experiences in her arduous vocation. She adds her valuable testi-
mony to the thousands already received by Swamp-Root. She said in a signed
Interview with a Reporter of the St. Louis Star:
"Although a woman in my position can receive plenty of prescriptions ' from
physicians without cost,'4t wa3 upon the advice of a well-known West End Doc-
tor that I began to take Swamp- Root. No, I will not tell you his name, for hÂ«
might not like it. But all the same. I took it when I was run down from night
work in the sick room. I was thin and yellow and tired even when I rose from my
sleep. Swamp-Root gave me a relish for my food and cleared my blood from its
Â¦stagnant impurities. Of course I do not prcise Swamp-Root as a cure for all
troubles, but it Is splendid* for the kidneys, stomach and bowels and relieves fe-
male disorders when all other remedies have failed to give relief.' I- know of
many cases in the hospital cured by this wonderful remedy.

Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for more sickness and suffering

Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Is soon realized. It stands the highest for Its wonder-
ful cures of the most tlstres3lng cases. Hospitals use it with wonderful success!
in both slight and severe cases. DoctQrs recommend it to their patients an/ usÂ»

My knowledge as to the nature of those

ries upon which other physicians base their
treatment. This knowledge I have pained
through fifteen years of careful study In
actual nractlce. Weakness Is not a result
of lar iin; nervous energy, but is due to the
existence of some abnormal condition at a
vital center of the organic system. To lo-
cate the ailment and properly treat It calls

THE CALLS RACING FORM CHART
Quadra, a ninety-one pounder, piloted
by "Bill" Knapp, had first call in the
betting on the last race. The. filly chased
out in front with Free Lance until when
within a furlong of the stand both were
all out. Ransch then dropped along with
Ei Mido, downing Quadra less than j a
length without any great effort. Free
Lance was third. i . Â¦
There were six starters in the Shattuck
Handicap at seven furlongs, with Hager
don, the top weight, going to the post
favorite.. Walter Jennings did not think
his filly Sister Jeanie would take to the
juicy going, and this fact, kept many
from backing her. She fooled them, by
going out, with Winslette on her back,
and, after racing the favorite off his lkgs,
beat Constellator a length. The last
named starter was- 15 to 1 in the- ling.
Neither Sweet Tooth nor rVarro showed
to any advantage, though both received
support. â¢ - - .â¢ â¢ .... v - , . .
Lee. Jackson scored his only win of the
afternoon on Larry Wilt in the mile sell
ing event. The brown colt closed equal
favorite with Black Dick, and, after lac
ing Satan into submission, went on. and
won by a couple of lengths at the wire.
Both Black Dick and Silver Fizz were
away from the barrier poorly and had
a world of lost ground to make up. â¢ In
a hard drive the former horse got the
place by a neck. Â¦Â¦ .-. -\
Sir Tom Tiddler, a 30 to 1 shot, piloted
by Larry Daly, captured I the five and
a half furlong run from- a bunch of nine
cheap platers. He was practically â¢ un
backed, and -won all the way. Flick, on
Axminster, the favorite, lodged a claim
of foul against the winner, which was
not allowed by the judges. Sir Claus
ran third ' behind Axminster.
Because of the sloppy footing,, the
price against W. O'B. Macdonough's Or
monde tilly Honiton went back from i to
5 to 11 to 10. Ransch had the leg up, and
s^he led from the start, (scoring in hollow
fashion from Horatius, a_6 to 1 shot.
The Forum made a good run from the
rear division, taking Â¦ the , show trom Es
sarola. ' ;
-.Â¦'-.,(Â¦Â» ites .that were tpppled over.
Axmlnster was badly messed about by
his rider. Flick; Hagerdon had to cry
quits through being raced to a' standstill
by ' Sister : Jeanie, and "Quadra- met | the
same fate in the closing race. The star
long-shot performer turned up in Mike
Daly's colt Sir Tom Tiddler, which regis
tered first at odds of 30 to 1, after having
been played on : numerous occasior.3 in
the past.
With a number of. horses scratched
from the opening seven-furlong- selling
event. School for Scandal closed a 2 to b
favorite. The- mare outclassed her com
pany - -and won : off . . by ..' herself. Away
poorly, Marineuse got up in ample time
to beat Onyx but for the place.

VICTORIA. B. C, April 1.â Tonkin ex
changes received here to-day contain par
ticulars of a disaster to a Chinese-owned
launch in the river near Hanoi, in
volving serious loss of life. The launch
Kwang Pat left Namdlnh for Hanoi, hav
ing on board Madame Arlhao, the wife of
an inspector of the native guards, who
was lying sick In the Luessen Hospital in,
Hanoi, their infant child and more than
200-* Chinese passengers.' -*>-'" ,Â¦
The launch was .obviously overloaded
with passengers and merchandise, and at
the village' of Ninghsu began to fill with/?
water and eventually foundered, *. It was*
a dark night and the scene must have'
been terrible, for in spite of the. efforts of
some junk people to rescue the unfortu
nate passengers more than 250 .persons,
including Madame Arlhao and her baby
and a number of Chinese women and chil
dren, were drowned.

LOS ANGELES, April 1.â The San Ja
cinto forest reserve land in Riverside
County was opened to entry at 9 o'clock
this morning. But seven claimants ap
peared at the land office in this. city, and
these had been waiting for two weeks.
At midnight, or nine hours previous to
the' hour named in the proclamation, a
crowd of men in wagon's-," on horseback
and on foot made a. wild rush on the
land from the reservation borders. Those
who registered , at the. loeal land office*
also had "rushers" at the reservation. -
It is expected that when the land office
opens to-morrow morning the "sooners"
will arrive, prepared to file upon lands
where they squatted early to-day. This
procedure will bring on the real contest
for the kind. Â¦ â¢ .

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 1.â
A field day has been arranged by Captain
McCaugherri of the varsity track team to
take place between the Occidental College
athletes and a team picked from the two
Stanford underclass .teams. The meet
will be held at Santa Monica April 12.
Preparations are being made for the
varsity track team to take a trip through
Oregon and Washington. It is probable
Stanford will meet Washington at Seattle
on May 2. A field day will also be ar
ranged with -Pacific University and with
the University of Oregon. The varsity
nine will meet the San Francisco League
ball tossers for the second time on Thurs
day. The last, game was a walkover for
the leaguers. As the varsity men have had
little practice since then the professionals
should score an easy victory.

RACE FOR LAND
Each angler returned with a full basket,
and the comment In every direction was
to the effect that it is many years since
a" season opened so brilliantly..
Rain fell in torrents throughout the
morning, but it neither dampened the ar
dor of the anglers. nor impaired the sport.
The majority of , the men were on the
stream before the rain Set In and braved
out the storm, returning to luncheon
dripping wet, but with well filled creels.
The afternoon cleared up and the an
glers sallied forth under the bluest of blue
skies, flecked here and there with a dash
of white. The stream remained clear and
the sport was not injured in the slightest.
I It was the consensus of opinion among
the men familiar with the stream that
there were more trout there than in many
years. Three steelheads, weighing nearly
ten pounds each, wera taken from the
White House pool, one by H. Battu, an
other by a friend of his and the third by
M. J. Geary.
The majority of the anglers used, a
small 'spoon, Wilson or Lafarge spinner
or- worms, the familiar "barnyard
hackle. Some flies, the brown hackle
and midgets were used successfully near
Point, Reyes by C. R. Kenniff and others.
Leon Jessu had the star basket of the
day. , 172 trout, i One weighed six pounds,
while- a twenty-four Â¦ Inch fish weighed
four pounds. Jessu fished the Paper Mill
from Tocaloma to . the schoolhouse and
back. - ' -..Â¦â¢"> â¢â¢â-', v Â¦- Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦'- â¢*Â¦Â¦;- -: â¢
T. C. Kierulft .took eighty-five from the
creek near Camp -Taylor. He Was fishing
toward a pool r where he knew .from indi
cations he would get good returns, when
It commenced to rain heavily. ., He sought
shelter under a tree and, much to his cha
grin, another angler . came along . and
pulled trout out of the pool he- had in
view until he grew tired of the pastime.
Mr. Kierulff could not "cut in again
without violating angling ethics.
T. Rothschild caught 65, W. Stevens 65
and R. Haas 35, all good sized fish.
PAPER MILD CREEK, from Point
i Reyes to Lagunitas, afforded sen
sational sport, to a large number
of anglers yesterday, the opening
day of. the trout fishing- season.
One hundred and fifty men each caught
from thirty to 172 trout, weighing from
a quarter of a pountl to ten pounds for
steelhead3. Many -half-pound fish were
taken.
A T Dobson secured 50, F. Kaiser 38,
S F Murphy 20, including a big one.
L. S. Peterson had 75, while M. C. Post
picked out a choice lot. â¢ _
C F Breidensteln, Charles Precht and
Bert Spring each had full creels.
Up at Point Reyes H. C. Wyman and
! wife, John Butler, Frank Marcus, Jeff
"Wells, H. Battu, J. B. Kenniff, C. Â». Ken
nlff. Ralph Brjggs. M. J Geary, W. J
Savage of Ohio and Louis Boutelller each
secured from forty, to fifty nsh during the
heavy rain of the morning. They were alt
out again In the afternoon and were, If
anything:, more successful.. They were so
enamored of the sport that the majority
of them remained over to try again to
day.
"Shorty" Briggs, who is nearly six and
a half feet tall, was out In all the rain
and was wet through. When he returned
to the hotel John Gallagher and others
furnished him a complete outfit. Any
Howard-street tailor would lose all his
customers If he sent Briggs out with such
tight-fitting garments as those in which
he appeared. When it came to shoes the
resources of the house were exhausted
and Briggs had to wait until his own
dried out. The afternoon found him down
at the sand spit, near the bridge, as en
thusiastic as ever. For a time he posed
as the champion "hard mouth" or
"sucker" catcher. He landed six of these
useless fish In almost as many minutes,
when his luck changed and the trout came
his way.
It was just like shooting them the way
Jeff Wells took them out of the riffle9 be
tween the bridge and the White House
pool. At the latter place seven ten-pound
steelheads were hooked, but only three
were landed. The others made off with a
variety of tackle, Battu alone losing three
fish.
Frank Maskey passed Point Reyes yes
terday en route to Salmon Creek. On the
previous day Achille Roos, Sam Heller
and Dave Sachs went on to the Gualala,
where they will try for steelheads for sev
eral days.
When the anglers who were so fortunate!
as to be out on the opening day commence
to circulate among their friends and tell
them what they accomplished and what
they saw there will be many acute cases
of angling fever developed throughout ths
city. There is only one treatment will
allay the diseaseâ a day on some nearby
trout stream. It is expectedSaturday will
witness an exodus of anglers, who will
scatter over Marin, Alameda and Santa
Cruz counties.

If you have any of the varied symptoms
of rheumatism, neuralgia, dyspepsia, liver
complaint, kidney disease, eczema or salt
rheum, a few bottles of Paine's Celery
Compound used at this time will rapidly
dispel all trouble and danger. We urge
every weak, ailing and sick person to fair-
ly test the medicine that is doing more for
suffering humanity than all other oom-
bined remedies.
Paine's Celery Compound is pre-emi-
nently the best spring medicine known to
medical practitioners for thoroughly
cleansing and purifying the blood and
banishing the varied Ills that result from
a poisoned and impure condition of the
life stream.
To thousands of people, out-of-sorts,
Â¦weary, despondent, morose, irritable, with
Â¦weak, faltering step, pale faces and dull
and sunken eyes, not sick enough to be
confined to bed, this is a critical and dan-
gerous seasonâ a. time that urgently calls
for prompt action, if recuperation and
cure are the prime objects.
The past experience of .hundreds of
thousands, including able medical men,
clergymen, judges, lawyers, literary men
and women, the rich and those in high so-
cial position, points unhesitatingly to
Paine's Celery Compound, the great medi-
cal prescription of modern times, that
Kives to the ailing, sick and diseased the
true condition of health that insures hap-
piness and true pleasure from day to day.
Tho virtues peculiar to Paine's Celery
Compound Quickly manifest their power
In the correction of unhealthy nerve ac-
tion, and supplying the veins with pure,
more abundant, more vigorous and life
giving blood.

It is reported "from Chicago that it is believed the
six railroads named in" the restraining order agreed
not to contest the petition ( for injunction- at this' time
in order that other roads may eventually beibrought
into court and compelled to live up to the require
ments of the law.
WHILE" urging Congress to clothe it. with
a â¢ largely increased power, the' Interstate
Commerce* Commission has engaged, in a
vigorous fight ; to compel the railways centering at
Chicago to obey the law.' . As a means to that end,
the commission some time ago applied to the Federal
court, asking that, a temporary restraining order .be
issued against six entering that city. The
railroads did not contest the petition, and it was duly
granted by Judge Grosscup with the statement: "But
for the compliance of -the defendant . I should have
required the fullest possible hearing. The matter is
one of extreme, importance and not to be decided
without the most mature deliberation." V

who^is contesting the validity of the or
dinance in question, the court
at^some length. He denied; that the con

is "Â¦ unreasonable ; and therefore void. .
The speaker contended; further that "the
police power of the; Supervisors was not
limited to the regulation of nuisances, but
that 'it i extended to the limits of abate
ment and suppression. The rights, of own-f
ers of plats in cemeteries were subject to

, Attorney McEnerney, who represented
the Board of Supervisors, summed up his
argument 'briefly. He .discussed the va
rious points made by the other side and
declared ;that*the term regulation under
the' constitution -meant :ln- fact an ordi
nance^ so that^the contention that the
Board of Supervisors might regulate but
not prohibit, was hot proved. %'J;-',
The arguments in the constitutionality
of | the ordinance -prohibiting burials ; in
the' city '. and county of San Francisco
were completed before Superior Judges
Â¦Cock, Dunne and Lawlor,' sitting in. bank,
ye%terday. The rnatter at issue was sub
mitted to the court and the promise made
that an early decision would be rendered.
law; It could not with the mere stroke of
a pen confiscate the property of 30,000 citi
zens without providing for their compen
sation.
Attorney W. S. Wood followed with a
brief r argument, in which he said the
burial ordinance was in conflict with the
.general laws of California and therefore
veld. Decisions in support of this conten
tion were read to | the court, g The sub
stance of .these was that When a man
bought a cemetery plat the ownership
thereof was vasted In him- and his heirs
at-law forever, and that no municipal
legislative body could deprive these of the
rights of ownership. BBjBW
In support of the claim that it was a
custom as old aa the fabled hills to re
spect cemeteries as sacred, and that the
rights of owners thereof were perpetual,
the speaker read a portion of Genesis
xxiii, in which is recorded the negotiations
of Abraham with the sons of Heth for the
purchase of . a burial place .i for. Sarah.
This deed vested in Abraham. and his de
scendants absolute ownership"'forever
more. Â¦ The claim of ."the other side that
? there was no available land in this city
and : county was declared to be erroneous,
and the argument was advanced that the
need of burials' in .adjacent counties did
not' exist. Â¦-
This practically closed the argument.
Attorney McEnerney asked leave to make
a reply, to Woods on the ground that he
had raise/I issues which' were not pre
sented by counsel for the appellant in the
opening argument. This being granted in
opposition to the objection of Woods, who
si.nl; McEnerney was bound to have the
last word, he proceeded to say that the
sections of ' the" Penal Code relating to
; cemeteries conferred police powers upon
the Supervisors for, their regulation ar.d
suppression. The ( other side; contended
that a cemetery could onlybe.dosaJ by
repealing the law under which they 'y\ne
established and not by a municipal -oorty,
Â£:i:c:n as the Board 6t Supervisors. Tbo
case was then submitted, Judge Cook sui
â¢liouncnipthat a decision might b*e reach

The committee asserts in its report: "It can work
no injury to our industry if we make this small re
duction in Cuban sugars. The enactment f of this
bill will not affect the protection of the sugar pro
ducers of the United States." ; Utterances similar to
that have been heard for years from free traders and
their Democratic allies. It was by such assertions
the people were led tc elect a Congress pledged to
reduce tariff duties. Experience with the Wilson
tariff soon showed what a reduction of protective du
ties meant. to the industries .of the country; and at
the. ensuing elections the people voted overwhelm
ingly for consistent rnd comprehensive protection.
It is strange,, therefore, that some of the very men
who were chosen to enact a protective tariff are now
advocating a scheme which will destroyits symmetry
luid revive the tariff agitation; and moreover arc
trying their scheme by argument's identical with
tliose the free traders and tariff -tinkers have- been
ttsing for years.
monize with that declaration, unless it can be shown
that we do not produce sugar?
Protectionists of liberal minds will admire the
nerve of the men who have submitted to Congress
an official report asserting that the reduction of du
ties on Cuban sugar is in accord with .the declarations
of the Republican platform on the subject of pro
tection and reciprocity. The platform adopted at
Philadelphia, after declaring "We renew our faith in,
the policy of protection to American labor," goes on
to 1 say, "We favor the associated policy of reciprocity
so directed "as to open - our - markets on favorable
terms for what we do not ourselves produce in re
turn for free foreign markets." How can the report
of the Ways and Means Committee be made to har- (
There are \'ery few genuine protectionists in the
United States who will assent to any single state
ment in that conclusion.. Democrats and free traders,
however, will 'hail it with gladness. If the assertion
were true that the American sugar industry will not
be injured by the competition of the cheap labor on
sugar â¢ plantations of the rich island of Cuba, then
it would be equally true that other American indus
tries might be subjected to extensive foreign compe
tition without injury. If it be true that this treaty is
in accord with the reciprocity doctrine of the Re
publicart platform and the declarations of President
McKinley, then other reciprocity treaties of a similar
kind would also be in accord with the platform.
Finally, if . the surrender; of the. sugar .industry to
foreign competition be in entire harmony ' with the
protective system, then the. surrender of other indus
tries' to competition would also be "protective." Such
doctrines in short will be hailed with joy by the op
ponents of protection, for if they be valid, "protec
tion" ceases to be reasonable and becomes a self
-evident absurdity.
"It is a happy circumstance that, without any injury
to our own industries, and without the Joss of any
thing except seven or eight million dollars of revenue,
which we do not need, we are able to extend this
rtlief to Cuba. and. at the same time get reciprocal
trade relations with her.- Aside from the exceptional
case that Cuba presents, the action of the committee
is in entire accord with the reciprocity doctrine of the
Republican platform and the declarations of Presi
dent McKinley and Piesident Roosevelt. It involves
no proposed revision of the tariff jor anything not
entirely in harmony with the maintenance of the
protective system."
The argument for the bill in the report of the com
mittee is made up miiinly of assertions that cannot
be sustained in debate, and it concludes by saying:
FROM the Ways and Means Committee of the
House the Cub:.n reciprocity treaty has been
presented along with an extended piece of spe
cial pleading in its behalf. It remains to be seen
"whether the stalwart protectionists of the House can
defeat the scheme, but the outlook is doubtful, for
the vote in committee shows that a good many
Democrats will vote for the bill. 'Still it will be worth
while for the protectionists to make as strong a
fight as they can in the House ; for the sake of
strengthening ; protection sentiment and increasing
the chances of defeating the bill in- the Senate. ,
THE .CUBAN SCHEME.
Taken altogether, the composition of the Demo
cratic Congressional { campaign committee is, decid
edly variegated. It; was accomplished by a unani-.
mous vote and - the thing looks . harmonious, ; butâ
wait till you hear from Bryan.. I
Another feature of the situation is worth noting.
Mr. Cable is. not only a very rich man, but is a large
stockholder in the, Chicago, Rock Island and. Pacific
Railroad, a corporation that is supposed to exert a
strong influenceon the politics of several of the Mis
sissippi Valley States. It is believed he will.be; able
to swing the railroad influence to the. Democratic
side, and that fact gives him a. good deal of prestige
in the Democratic . camp despite the " loudness with
which the party denounces plutocrat*.
The fact that Cable is to be the chairman of the
executive committee and Nixon is to have charge of
the finance "committee seems to imply, that 'Griggs;
will be only a figurehead. If that be-so the Bryan
ites have the husk and the reorganizers thekernel.
The. selection of Cable to take i active charge of the
campaign is especially notable. During the time of
the wrangle over the chairmanship and shortly after
the defeat of Griggs at the first meeting Cable's name
was frequently mentioned by, the reorganizers as' the
proper man to take charge 'of the : campaignf He
managed the Western canvass for, . Cleveland in . 1892
with marked success, and wh^e he did not publicly
bolt Bryan's nomination he was. not a worker for
him.- Consequently he -is looked upon as anything,
rather than a Bryan man, and the fact that he is now
to be chief of the executive committee implies that
the 'reorganizers have been able to force a compro-:
mise oh the Bryanites and virtually capture the com-'
mittee. . - ''-*Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦: ::'.'' 7 .' . â¢-:*â¢>;
: \ All those' reports have proven ill founded. .By some
riieans the wrangling factions have been brought into
harmony, and the, man, who could not .command; a
bare majority at the first meeting has the satisfaction
of obtaining his election by a unanimous vote. : Some
thing has been doing, in the. Democratic ranks,
though it is not yet quite; clear what mind has direct
ed the doing. ..
The unanimous election of" Griggs gives evidence
of the active pulling of Â«i good many .hidden wires
during the last two orthree. weeks. At the first meet
ing of Â¦ . the Democratic . Congressional campaign
committee an attempt was made to elect Griggs, but
it was defeated. It was stated at that time that. the
nomination of Griggs ..was the first open movement
of v the Bryan faction of the party to head off the work
of the reorganizers and his defeat ; was hailed by the
conservatives as a victory. The opponents of Bryan
were so much encouraged by the vote" that they un
dertook to bring forward a candidate Who would rep
resent the demand for a new leader and a new "de
parture. Then came reports of the probability of the
election of. Senator Martin ,.or-. of Senator Gorman or
tven of'some-Democrat still more; pronouncey in his
antagonism to the Chicago platform. Â¦;Â¦ Â¦
gether. ' They terminated the long dispute over the
chairmanship of the campaign committee by the elec
tion of Representative. Griggs of Georgia by a unan
imous vote: _ It is. announced, that the executive com
mittee to 'be appointed later will have for its
chairman Ben. T. Cable "of Illinois, and the finance
committee \yill be headed by Lewis Nixon of New
York. As neither Cable .nor Nixon are members of
Congress- it' appears the 'of Congress do ]
not feel able to take care of themselves and are reach
ing out for help to the country at'ferge.
AFTER much pulling and hauling- the Demo
crats of Congress, have.. managed. to get their
, Apolitical machine out of the mud and patch it
up for work in the' approaching Congressional cam
paign. Moreover, they managed, by one means or
another, to accomplish' the feat of pulling all to-
THE DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN.
The recent report that King Edward has taken to

to an investigation of the snuff 'trade in Great Britain
and the discovery that the 'usetof the article has been
steadily declining for many years, consequently if the
King takes the matter up. he will be helping not an
infant industry, but a decadent one. .

Through such institutions the State is concerned,
indeed, with men, women* and. children, with human
ity in its powerless and pitiful aspects. The care
given them should not be formal, â¢ touch-and-go, be
cause it is what differentiates the modern Christian
state from the ancient commonwealth, that took.no
note of its people disinherited in faculties or fortune.
The State does not discharge its duty by^ regarding
only the corhmercial'tideof such a responsibility, nor
by putting such institutions among jthe assets of par
ties and treating !them as the spoils of victory. If
politics must loot, : let it victimize the strong, but
leave the weak and defective to benefit by the inspira
tion of that voice which cried, "As ye have done it
unto one of the least of 'these, ye have done it unto
me.". â¢ '-. -- Â¦-- " -\! â¢. - '.Â»;Â¦'â¢ : < Â¦- '"Â¦
"This is riot simply a. commercial question. These
institutions deal with men, women and children, and
are the embodiment of the loftiest philanthropic sen
timent, of the State."' Their work -should not be car
ried on in a mechanical way. Philanthropic services
and business ability combined in the management of
these institutions should produce the best results.
Competent boards' of managers can always be obr
tained, and their powers, be properly regulated by the
Legislature." ' t
*; The State of New York has had a general board
"for thirty-five years in charge of its eleemosynary
institutions. .This 'Siate Board of Chanties, in its
last report, expresses '.the- need. of individual manage
ment. That report declares 'that 'The management*
and control of State charitable arid' reformatory in
stitutions should -be intrusted to, individual boards. of
managers, composed of -ghilaAthropic citizens of the,-
State. Â¦ Men arid women at'eharacter and^ intelligence,.
who have time and ability .to give to the-'service.pf
the State, should be encouraged, as they are.inrother;-
States and countries where charitable and reform
work has reached- a. .high: state of development, to
devote themselves to the service of the State by act
ing as members of the boards of managers of its in-;"
stilutions. This course not. only greatly benefits- the.
institutions through* the enthusiasm, the > special
knowledge and the disinterested and gratuitous ser
vice which such numbers bring to the work, but also
keeps theif management largely free from the semi- '
mechanical administration which a central board, of
control, having many ! institutions and diverse,inter
ests to care for, is -able to give to each. Besides
helping to keep the institutions out of -the undesir
able routine liable '- to follow the administration of a
central board of paid officials, it keeps their manage
ment in closer touch with the people. -
To mass all these institutions under a common
directory would impair: their usefulness and defeat
their purpose.: Their business administration would
be economized and improved by abolishing oar pres
ent Board of Examiners, composed of State officers,
who act cx-olTicio.'janti substituting therefor a board
of account-and audit, to do. well what. the Board of^
Examiners now does '.defectively and inefficiently.
Such a beard, should enforce a common system of
accounting for all State institutions, putting our
policy in that respect in' line with the movement that,
is going on to compel, in public accounting, the same
exactness and system that are the rule in private and
corporate business, -The board should also have vis
itorial powers, and 'pay, that it may inspect ever>'
institution and be prepared to affirm or icject the de
mands that each make f- upon the Legislature for ap
propriations, either, foi special purposes or support.
The university; regency requires men who will not
only manage well the business of the institution, but
who are: also Â¦ scholars, au courant with university
work everywhere/ ..Our . penal institutions will not
be well-managey unless in their directory there be
some men who.have mdre than dipped into penology.
On- that directory business capacity and knowledge
of the latest known in the management of criminals
should be combined. The same is true of the man
agement of the incorrigible: As for the insane, the
feeble-minded and blind and- deaf and dumb, the same
policy is most requisite. Management of the defec
tive classes is of a' peculiar nature. The requirements
of the juvenile blind are entirely different from those
of the adult blind. They should not be under the
same management nt all. ;-- Â¦
The scheme; is alluring to the practical politician.
It would give control of rieariy four thousand places;
and of an expenditure which runs into the millions.
A rake-off artist; would thrive in such a. situation.
But-asidc-from.-tht.dangerlof putting all that power
and patronage in the hands of 6ne board, under
the most -honest management the institutions, would
suffer.' It is impossible to find .three men or. five

With that declaration -to go. upon, it would seem
the commission has now a chance to accomplish good
results:. The railroads have often invoked' injunction
to stop the enforcement of law, and now. we shall
see if injunction can prevent them from violating it.
The possibility that the process of enjoining rail-'"
ways from violating the law may. prove "'the.vitaliz
ing principle" of the interstate commerce act and
the Sherman law. renders the case ont of supreme
interest. It may go- far toward solving the whole
problem that is so perplexing in its complications
and avoid the necessity for new legislation. â¢. - : . i~
In issuing the injunction,, the court said: . "If any
departure from the established rates is made by any .
of these, railroads during the pendency of these or

rates as every other shipper. The kind of traffic oh
which these-bills are based is much more complicated
than mailible matter, and; the rates, therefore, should
be -subjected ; to that v ir.uch stricter regulation. * But'
the question here is what 1 power ' the ; Government
has to enforce the provisions of this interstate com
merce act. - If this for an injunction, can : .
be maintained, . it will make the courts y>l equity;the;

This American landscape artist who has
achieved so much distinction abroad was
a pupil of Samuel Parsons, superintend
ent of the New York parks. He Is a son
of the late Joseph D. Strong, the well
known artist and portrait painter, and
was born in San Francisco. His .mother,
Mrs. Isabel Strong; and his grandmother,
Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson, are in this
city.
The trustees heartily concur In the broad
views which have been your gullding principle
In deciding how the park should be dealt with,
while the leaving of the natural beauties of
the . scenery undisturbed appeals to them as
the crowning feature of the work. â¢ â¢ : â¢
The trustees wish you a prosperous professional
career and hope that some day in the future
you may â¢ again visit Auckland and drive
through .the. Grand avenue In the Cornwall
Park, of your designing, to the summit of his
torical One Tree Hill.
The letter ' commending the -design is
signed by . Arthur M. Myers, chairman,
and all the , other trustees ! of the park
board. Dr. Logan Campbell, who pre
sented s Alickland with the land for the
park, joined in testifying to the excellence
of the design. On the written recom
mendation of the Auckland Scenery Con
servation Society the Council of: the city
sought to engage Strong to supervise the
improvement of all the city parks, but
professional engagements in the United
States would not allow him to. remain in
New Zealand.- '-i J Â£l. V.-*! > Â¦ ' Â¦'.'"
Among the ; passengers:: of the Oceanic

Cornwall Park, Auckland, N. Z. The park
embraces a mountainous area of 400 acres,

While the committee on promotion has
not finally been made up, the greater
number of members are selected. - Messrs.
McCormick and W. A. Bissell of the San
ta Fe Railroad Company were present to
represent the respective lines in the tem
porary organization of the promotion
committee, but desired to' bp released
from regularly serving. .The reason they
assigned for this action was that they
could do more outside, of the committee
than within it; also they were out of town
frequently. The other members of ' the
committee made many complimentary re
marks . concerning the railroad men, and
expressed themselves so strongly in favor
of. having Messrs. McCormick and Bis
sell serve that they finally agreed to re
main on the -committee: Both said that
they were earnest in. their desire to as

best of their ability. Mr. Bissell said that
he had been instructed by the president
of the Santa Fe Company to be present
and aid all that he could.

NEW YORK. April I.â The stagnant condi
tion of the London market this morning on the
resumption of trading after the four days' in
terval still further deferred the , hopes of the
speculative contingent, which has been count
ing upon an awakening in the stock market. The
continued absence fiom the street of large
capitalists and the coming departure for, Eu
rope of the central figure of the" financial dis
trict had a further discouraging effect upon
the smaller traders, who have been professing
confidence that the powers In the money world
were going to "put' stocks up." The" conse
quence was considerable selling by tired hold
ers and a drooping market. The sagging tend
ency gradually- permeated the whole.list,.over
coming the strength of those specialties which
rose strongly early In -the day. The leaders in
activity werÂ»- Colorado Fuel. United States
Leather. Amalgamated Copper . and Sugar
Colorado Fuel lost all of Its gain, which
amounted at one time to 2%, and closed -with
a fractional net loss. Sugar was; under pres-'
sure and United States Leather stocks did, not
fully maintain their ' advance." Amalgamated
Copper, however, was persistently Â»' firm - and
closed at the top with a net Rain of 2 points."

occurred In many places." Light rain has fallen
in all sections except the Kacramento -Valley,
and hailstorms have occurred in portions of

Grain continues in excellent condition, and
in now making rapid growth. Prospects are.

and ,'rom present indications the quality will
be unusually good. More than average crops

There are but Jew reports of Injury to early

thus far. and no reports of serlouo ' damage.
Xearly all varieties were somewhat late In

crops, and unless heavy frotts should occur
within ih<i next two v.ecks thes^ fruits may be

CitruK fruits are in good condition.

GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
director of the' climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is .as follows:
The Weather and Crops.
â¢â¢Eastern buyers are constantly streaming
Into this city on' their way to secure as large
timber holdings as they can avail themselves
of, and timber acreage is going up week by
week, until there will come a time when al
most prohibitive prices will be asked for both
sugar pine and redwood lands. The Eastern
interests' need the lands badly, but they are too
shrewd to be gouged of their Eastern profits.
If a California or Western timber land holder
wants to get rid of his land, they are willing
to pay a reasonable price per acre for it, but
not a cent more, and the sooner the holders come
to recognize this factor, the better will be the
feeling- on both sides and the more rapid their
sales."
"Redwood and cugar pine hold the attention
of the buyers to a great extent, while the pina
and fir ; of .the Northwest is going well at the
recent advances. The building all o\'er this city
and throughout the coast has stimulated the
trade and the mille have more than they can
do. to handle the orders which are daily coming
into the local offices. Contractors are finding
it extremely difficult to obtain the orders . they
nf-ed. but the mills are doing all they possibly
can to fill tbPlr demands.
"The lurnber business hag eeen an Improve
ment all through the month of March and the
indications point toward its continuance for
some months to come. Prices have advanced In
even' grade, but It certainly looks as though
the end of this advance in reached, for it
would be folly to increase the quotations fur
ther owing to competition and other natural
conditions. The retailers have been foolish
enough to boost their prices too high and the
reaction is going to hurt some one. Why It is
that efrtain interests cannot b^ content with
well enough is difficult to say, but this case
illustrates tte matter in question to an excel
lent decree.

solicitor of Indianapolis, attempted to
commit suicide yesterday morning at his
lodgings, 333 O'Farrell- street, by firing a
bullet into his head. Â¦' His . aim was bad
and the bullet, instead of finding a fatal
spot, ranged downward and passed out
through his nose. He was taken to the
Central -Emergency Hospital and subse
quently, to the City and County Hospital.
He will recover, but the sight of his right
eye , is destroyed. 7 I
Richard I says he believed he would
please God by taking his life. - He had
been . drinking heavily lately, 1 and his re
morse was occasioned by thoughts' of Â«his
family, which he deserted in St. Charles,
Mo., and also by the memory of a murder
which he claims he committed in Missis
sippi. -He says that he . was moved to
commit suicide by a voice from heaven,
which demanded that he. make reparation
for the murder and for his cruelty in de
serting his familyj
in the Head, but .Will

his action in assessing duty on eight cases
Of cigars and one case of bamboo cigar
cases imported by William Lichtenberg
from Manila on the America Maru, whicli
arrived here March . 10. Lichtenberg
claimed that inasmuch as the importing
vessel arrived at Honolulu March 3 the
merchandisa had been brought within the
jurisdiction of the United States previous
to the taking effect of the Philippine tariff
act of March 8. The Secretary of the
Treasury holds that as the goods were
consigned to San Francisco and were not
brought to Honolulu with any intention
of being unladen there, they were not im
ported into the United . States until the
steamer arrived in this port, and were
therefore liable to duty.

A large, though not crowded, house was
attracted last night to Sherman & Clay
Hall to the first performance here of the
"Enoch Arden" melodrama of Richard
Strauss by Max and Julia Heinrich. The
poem, declaimed by Mr. Heinrich, and
with intermezzi for the pianoforte and
occasional accompaniment *to the poem
interpreted by Miss Heinrich, proved to
be a brilliantly interesting number. Miss
Helnrlch's accompaniment was not al
ways distinguished by complete sym
pathy, though she is technically
delightfully adequate, and neither is Mr.
Heinrich'-s diction of the clearest, but the
reciter's admirable dramatic sense, fine
poetic grasp and rich vocal charm com
bined to give a vivid picture of the Ten-,
nyson poem, to which the Strauss music
lent a rare and eminent grace. The com
poser speaks as one having authority, in
compelling note and new voice. There are
strange, and lovely as strange, harmonies
Jn this "melodrama," of which, musically,
there is Just sufficient to make one wish
for more. It was received with consid
erable enthusiasm last night and will
most likely be repeated at the Saturday
recital. Â¦â¢ Â¦ : â¢

Harry Byers, a ycung man who lives
with his grandmother at 783 Mission
street, has filed a suit for the annulment
of his recent marriage 'to Miss Emma
Gertrude Cureton on the ground that the
two brothers of the young woman co
erced him Into the matrimonial stati by
threatening to blow his head off with
their revolvers if he failed to marry their
sister. According to his sworn statement,
Byers was accosted on the street by
Crosby and Omer Cureton on January 17
an 1 both of them told . him they were
armed and intended to kill. him if he did
not consent to the marriage. Byers says
that the two brothers took him to the
County Clerk's office, where he procured
a marriage license and then later to the
chambers of Judge Joachimson, where
the ceremony was performed.
Byers visited police headquarters yes
terday and told his troubles. He w?Â» In-
Jormed that a civil action was necessary
to procure relief and went immediately
to the office of his attorneys, Sweeney &
Adams, who took the matter in hand
Byers met his wife at her home, at
Point Arena, and they kept company for
some time. He moved to this city and
claims that the brothers of the young
woman followed him here and forced
him into the marriage." .

The statement of net earnings showed
that the record by months was as follows:
The directors voted the usual dividends

NE^V YORK, April 1>-The directors of
the United States Steel Corporation, in
quarterly meeting here to-day, gave for
mal approval to the conversion plan un
der which it Is proposed to retire pre
fered stock to the amount of $200,000,000,
upon which dividends are paid at the rate

There is considerable agitation in the
camps of the Army and Navy Republican
League touching the election of a com
mander in chief. Major Andrew G. Myers
of Fort Jones, Siskiyou County, vice com
mander, succeeded to actual command of
the forces when General W. H. Seamans
passed away. Myers immediately blocked
the game of converting the league into a
Gage reinforcement. Some of the veter
ans fancied that he would issue an order
calling for an early election of a com
ir.ar.der in chief, but reposing faith in his
own judgment and skill he has decided to
defer the election until late in the cam
paign. He left the city for Fort Jones
yesterday and headquarters will be in Sis
kiyou County until the autumn leaves falL
The Gage programme for the judicial
ticket has been recently revised. In the
revision Judge Sweeny of Shasta was cut
out. The new deal provides that one can
didate for Associate Justice shall come
from San Francisco and the other from
Southern California. Van Fleet Is said to
be slated for this end.
Judicial Ticket Revised.
The intelligence that Tirey L.. Ford will
not be a canaidate for another term in the
cilice of Attorney General engages the at
tention of Republican leaders. Senator
John F. Davis of Amador is being urged
by his friends to .get in the race for the
nomination. The argument is advanced
that the name of Davis for Attorney Gen
eral would add strength to the ticket.
Judge John F. Ellison of Tehama, Alden
Anoerson of Solano and Colonel E. A.
Forbes of Yuba were in the city yester
day. Governor Gage. John Mackenzie and
Daniel Kevane were at the Palace Jast
evening. r * .
There is some trouble in the Gage camp,
caused by the definite knowledge that
Harbor Commissioner Kilpatrick will not
combine with Mackenzie to appropriate
Paris Kilburn's share of water-front
spoils to the Burns-Herrin push.
Grief in the Gage Camp.
From Yuba County comes the political
gossip that Banker Hideout of Marysville
is surveying the Senatorial field to ascer
xain if there are many weak places in the
Ferkins fences. It is said that he would
like to represent California In the United
States -Senate. He has been sounding
some of the party leaders in his region
to find the depth of feeling for Perkins.
Mr. Rideout Is a man of ample means and
many of the politicians would hail witft
special delight an authentic announce
ment that he proposes to enliven the Sen
atorial campaign. The prospect, of a walk
over for Perkins is not such a picture as
the average legislator enjoys.

Eon. Director. Goodwin will probably have
all the exhibits so far received in position
by the end of the week.
In the line of imports, which furnish a
guide to the business community concern
ing the goods that are marketable in the
countries contributing to. the museum ex
hibit,-the most conspicuous feature is the
general cheapness of nearly all the im
ports that have a large vogue,- especially.
In South and Central America. The mar
gin of profit is evidently very small on
any shipment, but the consumption of the
goods used as exhibits is so large that the
business is well, worth striving for. Eng-
land. and Germany have been exerting
their best energies for years- to get con
trol of .the trade of the South and Cen

is especially strong on fibers, gum copal,

John Stevens, Who Fled
From This City, Is
Now in Chicago.
Kitty Mclntyre Does Not
Show Any Remorse
for Her Conduct.
Mrs. Lydia jV Prescott, who has for
several years figured prominently before
the public in the work of various charita
ble organizations in San Francisco and
Oakland, is accused by Mrs. F. M. Smith
of Oakland, wife of, the "Borax King."
with having secured $100 from her under
false pretenses. The matter has been
brought to the attention of the Grand
Jury of Alameda County and action by
that body is now pending.
It is alleged that Mrs. Prescott repre
sented to Mrs. Smith that she was selling
to her a lite membership in the California,
bociety for tne .frevenuon of Cruelty to
Children of this city. In looking over the
annual report of the Children s Society
inrs. Smitn discovered that ner name dia
not appear in the list of life members.
She wrote to Secretary White, asking an
explanation. He informed her that she
was not credited in the society's bootts
with the lite membership fee. It then de
veloped that Airs. Prescott had collected
SlÂ«0 and had never turned the money over
to the society om'clais.
Mrs. Prescott was formerly employed in
the office of the California bociety tor the
Prevention -of Cruelty to Children. It is
stated that she was discharged from her
position. On {September 7, isa9, a short
time after her relations with the society
had been severed, she wrote to the board
of directors requesting that she be al
lowed to act as the society's agent in
Alameda County.
Not Authorized. SUS-
Several letters on file at the society's
office show that she was finally author
ized to act as an agent in Alameda Coun
ty, but she was especially directed not to
iuvolve the organization financially or
otherwise. She was also authorized to
secure new members, but was directed
not to collect fees from them. She wrote
a letter in which she agreed to the terms
as set forth on the records. On May 3,
lÂ»00, the society officials became convinced
that Mrs. Prescott was making collec
tions in defiance of the terms of the.
agreement and she was notified by the
secretary that her services as agent were
at an end.
On January 27, 1902, Mrs. F. M. Smith
wrote her letter of inquiry to Secretary
White. It then developed that Mrs. Pres
cott had secured $100 as a life membership
lee on February 7, 1900, and while she was
Etill acting as agent of the society. By
the terms of the agreement, however, she
was particularly enjoined never at any
time to make collections for the society.
Mrs. Smith has a receipt for the pay
ment, made out on a society letter head
which is said to be five years old and not
officially In use for nearly that period of
time.
Mrs. Smith -made the supposed member
ship payment in the form of a check
made out to the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The
check when presented at the bank was
made out to the "agt." of the society and
was indorsed by Mrs. Prescott as agent.
Grand Jury Investigates.
Mrs. .Smith and her private secretary
are said to have testified before the Grand
Jury of Alameda County that when the
check left their possession it was not
made out to the agent, but to the society.
It is also stated that the abbreviation
"agt." is written in another hand than
that in which the rest of the check Is
made out. Colonel Parnell. Secretary-
White and Colonel Charles Sonntag ap
peared before the Grand Jury and pre
sented the society records in the case.
Mrs. Prescott was also present with the
defense that she acted in good faith as
tne agent of the society.
Mrs. Prescott is now secretary of "The
Children's Protective Association," with
offices in the Academy of Sciences build
ing. She could not be found at the office
yesterday afternoon. In the annual re
port of the society for which Mrs. Pres
cott 5s secretary Sirs. Smith is mentioned
as a life member, but she says that she
never joined the organization.
The detective department of this city
believes that John Stevens, the athlete
who is accused of robbing Mrs. Elizabeth
Darling of jewelry and diamonds valued
at $10,000 last January, will soon be under
arrest. Monday afternoon Mrs. Darling
called upon Captain Seymour at the Hall
of Justice and imparted to him informa
tion concerning Stevens' whereabouts in
Chicago and a trap has since been set,
which, it is expected, will result in his
capture.
The police are not only confident of
catching Stevens, but they have a clew
as to where a large portion of the stolen
valuables have been disposed of, and they
will have little difficulty in recovering the
jewels.
Raymond Sanchez, who, it is claimed,
assisted Stevens in the bold crime, was
made a prisoner in the "windy city" and
is now awaiting trial in . the Superior
Court of this city.

MILITARY FUNERAL FOR
BOTH COL. AND MRS. POPE
Touching Tribute Is- Paid to Virtues
of Dead Member by Former
The Merchants' Exchange has adopted
a memorial reported by a committee con
sisting of F. Wheelan, M. Berg and Max
Brooks relative to the death of Albert
Gerberding. It is as follows:
"In all the duties of life he earned the
commendation and admiration of his fel
low men. In all the relationships of life
he proved himself worthy. No son could
have been more dutiful; no husband more
loving; no father more gentle; no official
more faithful; no merchant more up
right. His . virtues lack not for witness.
The memory of Albert Gerberding will
ever be eloquent in. the heartbeats of
these who knew him. Our commercial
body cannot but thank the great God of
all that while it deplores its loss it can
feel that it has been its privilege to num
ber among its members one who was at
once an inspiration and an example."

Joseph Millian and Charles Buchanan
appeared in Judge Mogan's court yester
day morning- and were arraigned on
charges j of burglary and assault to mur
der for ' entering the residence of James
Mclntyre at 961 Bryant street last Thurs
day morning and murderously beating
Mclntyre with the butt end of a revolver.
The hearing of the cases was continued
till next Monday.
Captain Seymour has not yet decided
whether he will prefer a charge against
Kitty Mclntyre, the daughter of the vic
tim of the assault, 'as an accessory before
the fact. She is being detained at the
City Prison as a witness. Yesterday she
identified the revolver found in the room
occupied by Millian at the Brunswick
House as the one Millian had told her he
had got from Buchanan the night before
the attack was made upon her father.
The police are satisfied that it was the
weapon used by Buchanan. *
William Mclntyre, a brother of the girl,
was taken to the prison yesterday to sets
her, in the hope that she might give fur
ther details of the assault, I but she said
she had nothing to add. to the statement
she made Monday night. Her utter heart
lessness in conniving at and instigating
the robhery of her aged father is almost
beyond belief. She attended' him at, St.
Mary's Hospital, where he was taken for
treatment, and the poor old man, beiiev
ing that he might die, drew a will, leav
ing her share and share alike of his
wealth with her five brothers.' She is an
only daughter. She declare^ that if Mil
lian is sentenced she will kill herself..
Mclntyre is rapidly recovering, but he
will not be asked to identify Buchanan
till he is convalescent.
Two of the other suspects. Reynolds and
Collins, were released from custody by
Captain Seymour yesterday morning, but
a charge of vagrancy was booked against
Samuel Rayons, the first suspect arrested:
He is a "hobo" from Seattle. *
Frankie Goodman, who resides in the
Brunswick House at the corner of Sixth
and Howard streets, made a statement to
the police last night, in which she cor
roborates the story told by, Kate Mclntyre
involving Joseph Milllan and Charles
Buchanan in the attack which was made
on Mclntyre. She said that after the
crime had been committed Mclntyre's
daughter came to her and told her every
l a 8 xÂ«â¢ S^ e k! ? ew "yarding Buchanan
>?Vi lians ? 1 V\* and the manner.- in
which they carried It Into execution. Sh*
said that Kate told her .Â¦" that Mlllian
struck her father down and that Bu
chanan thrust the pistol into his mouth
In felling Mclntyre Milllan;' she said used
a sandbag which he made himself.
e^,?u aman woman also said that she
saw Millian. making a sandbag. Her
statement will be one of the prosecution's
strongest points against ; Milllan. It is
fl ar ?. d , th ,at Mclntyre may not be able to
identify Milllan, but it is believed by the
police that Frankie Goodman's testimony
will prove his connection with the crime

AN Important real estate transac

Â¦which Mrs. Ernestine Kreling"
becomes the owner of the prop-
Mahony, since he became County Clerk,
has become = known as the man of many
promises, very few of which he kept.
There have been more disappointed office
seekers thronging- the corridors of the
City Hall since - he took charge of the
County Clerk's office .than ever -known
before. This is due to his "promising."
His frjends to whom- he said he would
give positions come to the hall every day
and anxiously await the fulfillment of the
promises he is so lavish with. The same
old stereotyped "Call around again in a
day or so" and a hearty shako of the hand
are all they get. They arc now begin
ning , to > realize ' that Mahony's . , promises
are but made to be broken and are grad
ually [ dropping Â¦ out of sight and . seeking
other employment. Interesting details
concerning . Mahony's political deals are
promised by these disgruntled ones, who
through The Call's exposure, have come
to a . realization of the nicely ., gilded
bricks Mahony has been handing out since
the. election. .. ' . ,
"Billy" Deane Makes Threats.
1 Both Mahony and French met in the
County Clerk's office later in the day, but
gave no sign that they were other than
close friends. TTiey both asserted posi
tively that no : trouble had occurred and
denounced The Call's story as a'false
hood. That . the battle really occurred,
however, is testified to by Bailiff Hillman
and J. Plowden, a janitor employed at the
hall.
; A half-hour after, the battle occurred a
sensation i was caused by an open boast
madelby "Billy" Deane in a saloon in the
neighborhood of the City Hall.; In the
presence of several witnesses Deane an
nounced that unless he got that "fifty"
he- would do more than French did to Ma
hony. Rumors of Deane's ' boast soon
reached , the hall- and in a 'very few min
utes every deputy County Clerk was dis
cussing the affair. . \
Mahony. Deane and French deny the
truth of The Call's story, but the fact re
mains that its publication was the cause
of the hostile actions of French. He met
Mahony .yesterday, morning, Â§hortly after
the latter -had reached the hall to begin
the duties of the day, and when Mahony
asked him' if he had read The Call, he im
mediately flew into a rage and struck him.
All this passing â¢ of bouquets and fists
was- due -to an article published in The
Call of yesterday. French does the work
of the cnief deputy in the County Clerk's
office, but says he does not receive the
pay the office entitles him to. According
to a tale of woe he poured into the ears
of ex-Assemblyman \V. Guilfoyle . and J.
B." Bonner Monday Mahony takes from
his salary $50 per month for the use of
"Billy" â¢ Deane, Mahony's predecessor,
who is rated as. cashier in the County
Clerk's office. I Deane is evidently a good
cashier, according to French's plaint.
French evidently gave up willingly at
the end of his first month's service under
Mahony, for no complaint was made un
til yesterday, when his second month's
salary was" due. Then, according to Guil
foyle and Bonner he refused, to" accede to
Mahony's request for Deane's "divvy,."
and made such objection that the refusal
got noised about.
The County Clerk and his chief deputy
then : walked to one side of the City Hail
corridor, where the trouble occurred/ and
held an earnest conversation for- several
minutes. .. All that could, be heard, was:
"You are a good fellow, Frank," and "I
know that, Bert, butâ." They finally sep
arated,. Mahoney going to the office of the
County Clerk and French leaving the hall
for the Hall of Justice.
Have Confidential Talk.
French was : very angry and took an
other step toward- Mahony. A second
punch '..was only averted through thetime
ly arrival of Deputy Sheriff G. G. Hill
man, bailiff of Judge Hebbard's court.
The bailiff is a little lellow and could not
have saved Mahoney had he not shown
his star. Even the sight of the badge of
the deputy Sheriff, failed to subdue French
and -it was only after Mahony had .been
pulled to one side that he allowed his an
ger to cool. . . Â¦ s : Â¦
"You're a good tellow, Â¦ Frank!" he
gasped, lor Alanony is stout and the quicK
siaeaiep he 'made to get away, irom
French's big- nst well, nigh rendered him
breathless. Â¦ ~ :
.."That's' all right, Bert, but it's all off,"
said French, "I'llâ "
".Let me talk with you, Frank," said
Mahony. .
But "Frank" was obdurate and refused
to hold' a- conversation with "Bert." Â¦ He
was evidently thinking of several little
talks he: had had witn. Mahony and de
sired no more. â¢ - ..... ....â¢_ "... .
