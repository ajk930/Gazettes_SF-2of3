LONDON. March 18.â Coincident with
the news of alarming rebellions in three
provinces of China, the Foreign Office
here to-day issue 1 a voluminous blue book
dealing with the protracted negotiations
between China and the powers from
March 28. 1S01, to September 7. 190L when
the final protocol was signed.- In its 173
pages of diplomatic dispatches, edicts and
digests of China's financial capabilities
there is ample evidence that the nego
tiations formed one of the most intricate
webs of international differences In the
history of the world. One striking^quo
tation peculiarly apt to. the press**. Far
Eastern situation can be" extracted from
a dispatch of the British Embacsador at
St. Petersburg. Sir Charles S. Scott, lo
Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Sec
rttary. in v/hich Count Lamsdorff, the
Russian ; Foreign Minister, is quoted as
Baying he was pleased at the fact that
the British Government was desirous ' of
hastening a return to normal' conditions
la China, but he dreaded the possibility of

Mrs. Hamilton. states that she met Gar
ratt only bnce~and that he did not impress
her' favorably^ She was aware that he
was a. warm friend of Smith/ She re
garded Smith. as a very superior man, but
he had ' always impressed . her as having
at one time in his career experienced some
gTtrat, sorrow. Morally, -as far a3 Â»ho
at the place mentioned, nor was a man
answering his description employed there
In the early' part of the current month.
What his purpose could' have been in de
ceiving "his friends as to his places of
employment cannot be fathomed, except
on' the theory that "he had something to
conceal.
Smith was of studious habits. He was*
asinzle-taxer and an ardent admirer of
socialism. About a year ago he met Mrs.
Jennie Hamilton, a widow of considerable
means, living at 3430 Sixteenth street, and
visited! her periodically. That he. advised
her as to certain investments was evl
.denced. by , the contents of. a certain let
ter, from . Mrs. Hamilton found among his
papers. There was some dispute between
them, which led to an estrangement. Mrs.
Hamilton ' said last night that Smith had
called -upon " her ; several , times and that
they talked about money matters. That
he was paying 1 .her serious attentions was
vigorously denied. She stated that she
saw Smith on'the. Monday previous to h!9
disappearance and that : he had promised
to-' call, on her. on, the following Sunday
evening.' When '.he failed to do so she in
stituted Inquiries Tand made the discovery
that : he had disappeared.

Throughout the extended negotiations
on the subject of the amount, division and
method of payment of the Chinese indent"
nlty Great Britain and the United : States
appear from the blue > book to have
worked hand in hand, though opposed by
all the other powers. After learning, of
the adverse, attitude of the continental
powers toward the American proposition
to reduce the indemnity to Â£4Q,CO3,O?O,
Lord ' Lansdowne instructed Sir Ernest

that the figures erred on the side of lib

that ' Smith was - his warmest 'friend. *; He
said he last saw Smith* on. the evening of.

by 'means of. a money "order addressed' to
Garratt , at i his old ' address, ;474,<Hay"es

Everything in- Smith's room : was.*so
arranged as to inspire one with the belief
that he left'it on Â» a temporary -mission.
He never went any. distance without tak
ing his glasses with him,' nor did he .ever
venture 'on a -long, walk,* such as a jour
ney to the park, .without taking his over

PECULIAR FACTS.
The story/of Smith's disappearance Is a
strange one. On February 6 .he received
his salary of $45 for the . month of Janu
ary, and one of his .first acts after draw- i
ing his pay was to issue a money, order
in favor of F. A. Hardy & Co. of Chicago
for "$15. ; He did not mail this order to the
payee, but placed it in a small memoran
dum book, in which it Â¦ was subsequently
found. On the -following day, which was"
Friday, he left the Palace. Hotel about 2
p. m.". and. went to his room at 837. Bush
street; a.' house kept by Mrs. Kate
Mackey. ' He emerged a moment ' later
witha bunch\of violets, which, he pre
sented to Mrs. Mackey with the remark
thata storm was threatening; He dis
cussed | the . probabilities : of rain . with her,
and then, remarked that he had two seats
for the Columbia for the following Tues
day evening and that if a certain young,
woman acquaintance desired to have
them he would gladly give] them up, as he
intended going to" Fischer's on the even
ing in question. '. He then went into his
room, and in a few minutes thereafter
Mrs. Mackey; heard^his door slam. This
was about 2:30 p. : m. When Mrs. Mackey.
went Into the room :' ten minutes later she,
found i that .Smith laid his overcoat
upon the bed, together with his kid
gloves and 'that his spectacles lay on the 1
table. ; That'-wajs the, last seen or heard;
of the missing man by, his friends here.

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G ' STREET.
N. XV. . WASHINGTON. March 18.-Offl
clal disapproval has been expressed by
the United States cf the refusal of Ger
many to evacuate Tientsin. China.
China has appealed to the powers to
name the date when it can resume con
jrol of the city, and renewed efforts will
be made by Secretary Hay to bring this
about as early as possible. The'-questlon
is an important one. because. it. is gener
ally understood that continued oppo
sition will have a decidedly unfavoraDle
effect upon the Chinese. They have kept
their part cf the bargain as stated in the
protocol signed by tne powers last SeÂ»
lember. a'nd the authorities believe *it
only just that the allies should carry out
the pledges which they made. .
. Germany is the single power opposed
to the abandonment of the allied govern
ment of .Tientsin and the return of the
â¢city to the Chinese authorities. . Great
Britain is anxious to withdraw her
troops. France had announced that she
will order the force she has at that poliit
.back to her Tonquln possessions, and
.Japan has instructed her troops to re
turn \ home. Neither Russia noV the
Lnitcd States is represented" by military
U Tientsin. In official circles here the
Impression Is strong that Germany . pro
poses to maintain a force at Tientsin un
til China grants her" additional conces
ilons in Shantung. This was her policy
before the Boxer uprising, when. Jn the
Fpring of 1SS9, she declined to withdraw
her legation Guard from Peking untii the
Tsung Li Yamen had authorized the rail
read concession.

remitted by executive clemency. It is
to the last degree improbable now, thir

Chairman Pierce * said : that much good
had resulted from the recent. convention
of grain growers at the State capital, but
that it was noticed that in some localities
there was a lack of proper; interest. He
urged the delegates not to be . discour

against the growers, and the latter being
but newly organized must not expect too
much at the outset.
P. R. Garnett of Willows moved: to
amend that section ot the. articles of. the
association declaring one of the purposes
of the association to be , the buying and
selling of grain. A long argument ensued,

has again "been obtained in.
Judge Kerrigan's 1 court.' Twice
within ' the last six . weeks have
distressed beauties received verdicts from
Juries summoned in that court Alma de
Bretteville was awarded a verdict for $1250
damages to her heart and affections, and
yesterday Mrs. Bertha Coulter was given
a verdict for $250 for damages to her
feelings.
In the case of Miss de Bretteville a
Klondike millionaire was the defendant.
In the case of Mrs. Coulter. the Chicago
and Alton Railroad Company must pay
the score.
Mrs. Coulter is the widow of Clinton R.
Coulter, a well-known bicyclist, who was
killed in a railroad accident in Nevada
in February of last year. She is one of
the noted Hadenfeldt sisters, whose
beauty has been long the boast of San
Franciscans. Her sister Joan, as queen
of the Mardi Gras ball of last year, elec
trified the local . world of society by her
beauty.
The fair plaintiff in yesterday's action.
Bertha, is also a beauty. She is a tall,
regal looking brunette, with a carriage
and demeanor indicating that a knowledge
of her charms is not the possession of
the society world alone. Becomingly at
tired in black and heavily . veiled she
made a charming picture as she sat in
the witness chair.
Mrs. Coulter brought suit against the
Chicago and Alton Railroad Company for
$1500 damages because she was put*off
a train a little this side of St. Louis, Mo.,
and compelled to travel to this city via
El Paso instead of San Antonio, Tex.;..
She testified that she bought her ticket
from Agent Kelly in Chicago and said
that when she paid $62 50 for the paste-

NEW YORK. March 18.â Poultney Blge
low. the prominent writer on political and
allied topics, was the first ' passenger
ashore from the Minneapolis, which ar r
rived from" London to-day. : â¢
'This country has plenty of trouble
ahead of it. and," Bigelow added signili
cantly, "the recent visit here of Prince
Henry means nothing whatever. It will
in no ways affect our relations with Ger
many, and it will have no influence what
ever on any possibility of war with that
nation. One thing more. No regard for
the Monroe doctrine is going to tnnuence
<Jermany when that country is ready to
act."
"You believe, then, that there will be
war with Germany?"
. "Germany is industriously colonizing in
South America,'" was. the reply. "Ger
many has also done her best to alienate
â n gland from America, but despite her
efforts, there will be no war between Eng
land and America. The interests of the
two great English-speaking nations are
too closely interlocked for that. No, there
will be no war between this country and
England, despite the efforts of Germany."
bigelow has long been known as a close
friend of Emperor William, the friend
ship dating from their school days at
Pojsdam. He was asked about the re
ported rupture with his old schoolmate.
"That is all nonsense," he said decisive
ly. "We are just as good friends now as
ever. I consider the German Emperor
the greatest man on earth except Presi
dent Roosevelt."
Bigelow said he had made a study of
conditions in Germany and would soon
write a book on the subject. He is en
gaged in writing a book on our colonies.
Regarding these he thinks America should
keep ail she has. For several years Bige
low has made his home in England. H<*
says he is coining to America to-stay
that America is the only place. vfor 'an
American to live.
"Too much living abroad," he 6ald, "has
a tendency to make one imbibe the senti
ments of the country In which he resides.
I am going to live here. A man should
live in his own country."

To Provs What the Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp-
Root, Will Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Call
t May Hayi a Sample Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
- - > ' TACOMA. Wash., Nov. 29. 1901.
DR. KILMER & CO.. Blnghamton. N. Y.:;:
Gentlemen:. It gives me great pleasure to add my testimonial to that of hun-
dreds of . others regarding the .wonderful curative properties of Swamp-Root. I
had a lame back | three years ago before, leaving North Dakota for the coast.
Soon aftjer.my arrival in the Puget Sound country.it became very much worse.
I felt certain that the coast climate had given me acute rheumatism and came
to the conclusion that I "could not live in this climate. Later I became con-
... vlnced that what I really had was kidney trouble, and that the rheumatism was
due to my\ kidney. trouble. The lameness in mv back increased rapidly and I
had other symptoms which Indicated that I would soon be prostrated unless I ob-
- tained relief . quickly. Noticing your offer of a sample bottle of Swamp-Root,
free, I; had a friend write for one and began taking it immediately. Within
â¢ three weeks the lameness in my back began to disappear. During that fall and
winter, I took three one-dollar bottles cf Swamp-Root, with the result that I be-
came completely cured. I. no longer have pains in my back and can exercise vio-
lently without feeling any bad effects. "I have recommended Swamp-Root to sev-
eral of .my acquaintances who were similarly affected and without exception they
have been greatly, benefited by its use. Yours very truly. -. r y . ,

' Lame back is only one symptom of kidney troubleâ one of manyâ and Is na-
ture's timely warning to show you that the track of health is not clear.
â¢ i-"-*. Â¦ If . these danger signals are, unheeded, more serious results are sure to follow;
. Bright's Disease, which is the worst form of -kidney. trouble, may steal upon you.
. The great kidney remedy. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, is used in the leading
I hospitals, recommended by physicians in their private practice, and is taken by
aoctors themselves who have kidney ailments, because they recognize In it foe
greatest and most successful remedy for kidney, liver and bladder troubles.
. EDITORIAL NOTEâ Swamp-Root has been tested in so many ways and has
proven so successful in. every case that a special arrangement has been made
I -.by, which all readers of The Call who have not already tried it may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely, free by mall. Also a book telling all about Swamp-
Root and containing many of the thousands upen thousands of testimonial let-
ters received from men and women who owe their good health, in fact their very
..lives, to the wonderful curative properties of Swamp-Root. In writing, beaure
and mention reading this : generous offer in the San Francisco Dallv Call when
sending your; address to Dr.. Kilmer & Co., BinKhamton.' N. Y.
If you are already convihced-that'Swamp-Rqot is wh&t you need, you can pur-
chase, the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar size bottles at the drug stores evtrv-

In all, twenty-three officers were sum

City Hall was momentarily turned Into
a police 'assembly room. % Officers were
taken from Important beats, some were
called out of bed, and others lost their
day , off, jor at least a large portion
thereof. The officers summoned were

out of the Grand Jury room at. the aver-*
age rate of one every two minutes,
"Never heard of - the fund until I read
of it In the paper" was the invariable
answer given by the patrolmen.
The reporter who was supposed to hava
written the article said he did not know
anything of the merits of the case. ThÂ«
matter may be taken up from, time to)
time until all the members of 'the Pollca
Department "have been examined. :
Con Donahue of First and Brannarl
streets, who claims he was beaten by,
Harry Rosslter, a special police officer,
on September 17, during the troublous
times of the late strike, asked the Grand

ing to .Donahue's statement- the casa
was dismissed by Judpre Fritz after many
continuances. Donahue wants Rosslter
indicted on a charge of assault with 4
deadly weapon. Donahue brought a num
ber of relatives and witnesses with him.
and after hearing one or two the mattes
was continned until Tuesday.
. A . special meeting of the . Grand JurT

to embody all .these in a report which
will also contain recommendations for
their abatement.

There were many rumors in circulation
to the effect that the flght was "fixed,"
but this proved early in the game to have
no foundation. lf\was because of these
rumors the judges were appointed. There
are many who are of the opinion that
â¢Hegarty was entitled to the decision, and
had a referee been given the right to
name the winner he would probably havo
taken the long end of the purse,* as ha
did most of the leading. In the last sev
en rounds, however, Herrera made up a
bunch of lost ground, and during that
time the flght was the fastest witnessed,
in this city for years past.
Hegarty in the majority of the rounds
set the pace, but his blows did not seem
to have much sting in them. Herrera.
with the exception of a slightly damaged
nose, came out of the mill without a
scratch. There is talk of matching tna
men again.
BAKERSFIEL.D, March IS.â Tim Heg
arty of Australia and Aurelio Herrera,
the local boxer, fought a twenty-round
draw to-night at the Scribner Opera
house, which was packed to suffocation.
The flght demonstrated that Hegarty
cannot deliver a knockout punch and that
Herrera, despite the statement to the con
trary/is devoid of any yellow streak.
The flght was refereed by Billy Lavigne.
The decision was given by Tom O'Boyle
for Herrera and Michael Shaughnessy for

LOS ANGELES, March 15.â At the eo

telegraphed Fitzsimmons to-night urging
him to accept the Century Club's terms,
for the reason that its bid contained an
absolute guarantee. He warned Fitzsim
mons not to be misled by the percentage
proposition of the San Francisco fight
promoters.
OAKLAND, March IS.â Billy Delaney.
manager for Jeffries, this morning said:
"I do not understand Fitrsimmons. One
moment he will talk to you sensibly and
like a gentleman, and then all of a sud
den he flies off the handle and acts for all
the world like a craxy man. I offered him
the selection of two reputable men to
referee, George Slier and Charles White,
both of whom have refereed all the big
fights. I could get no satisfaction outof
him and failing to get a reply on that
subject I offered to allow him to name
two mea of his own selection, and again
he had nothing to say. I tried to explain
J/iings to him, but he does not seem to
JiKe it. If he does not come to time we
will open negotiations with Sharkey." '

Why take sickening salts or repulsive
;jT castor oil? "Goes through you like 'a
dose of 'salts'*/ means violence, grips, gripes, gases,
soreness, irritation, and leaves your stomach andbowels
weak and burnt out. Might just as well^ take concen-Â»

; irig .truek that ; your stomach refuses unless you disguise
the^taste. Fool your own stomach, eh?- Don't ever
believe that anything offensive to your taste or smell is
to do-you real good: Nature makes certain

Lieutenant U. 8. N.; In charge.
Time Ball;
Mosckos Is said to be a good carpenter,
but -has been in trouble before and .is said
to have left the steamship Newport un
der the cloud of a similar exhibition, the
responsibility for which, however/ was
never quite brought home to him. Prior
to Joining the Ventura he worked for the
Risdon Iron Works. He Is a Greek, about
39 years old.
Considering the brevity of Mosckos'
visits the amount of damage he wrought
was marvelous. Furniture was hacked to
pieces, crockery, smashed and everything
breakable In the boatswain's room was
broken. The boatswain's entire ward
robe was thrown into the bay and a con
certina belonging to a member of the
crew was smashed to smithereens.
Mosckos refused to discuss ! the matter
yesterday morning. He â¢' knew nothing
about breaking anything, had never
heard of a flre and couldn't Imagine how
anybody could think he would harm the
boatswain-.
force It open. Don't report me. I'll wait
for my clothes until to-morrow. I don't
want to waken the men."
Ilogtrs escorted Mosckos oft the ship.
As he was saying good-night two mem
bers of the crew, partly dressed, rushed
on deck, yelling:
"Arrest that man. Don't let him go.
He's wrecked the forecastle." . :
Morckos took this as his cue and mado
a rapid exit. Ho returned to the dock
yesterday morning and was arrested by
Police Sergeant Tom Mahoney. He. was
locked up on a charge of malicious mis
chief.
STRICT compliance on the part of
the Oceanic Steamship Company
with the marlnu Insurance re
quirements saved the biff mall
steamship Ventura Monday night
from serious damage, it not total de
struction, by flre.
Because he blamed the Ventura's boat
swain for causing his discharge from the
i hip, George Mosckos, a ship carpenter,
entered the forecastle of the Ventun
Monday night, smashed everything
breakable In the boatswain's room, threw
all that petty officer's clothes overboard,
poured, mineral sperm oil over the wood
work in the porter's store room, and then,
after adjusting the ventilators so as to
a draught, applied a match to the
wood.
The mineral cperm oil, on account of its
Ron-combustible qualities. Is the only
kind of illuminating oil the insurance
companies vrill allow to be used on ship
board. Had It been kerosene, as Mosckos
might have Imagined from the can in
which he found It, nothing could have
averted a hot flre and a terrific explosion,
as many gallons of fuel were stored In
the vicinity of the fire. As It was, how
â¢ ever, the names died out after blackening
*. the walls and blistering the paint. The
fact that arson was attempted was not
discovered until yesterday morning.
Mosckos was carpenter on the Ventura
on her last voyage. He was dismissed
for brawling with a sailor while the ves
sel was awaiting discharge from quaran
tine. He blamed George Glair, the "boat
swain, for his dismissal.
Mosckos* clothes are still aboard the
Ventura and about 9:15 o'clock Monday
night he went to the forecastle for the
purpose, he told Quartermaster Randall
.riogerE, of getting his belongings. He
stayed in the forecastle but a few min
utes. As he went ashore he said he would
return later, whea the boatswain was on
board.
About midnight he went back. Soon
after he entered the forecastle Rogers
heard a crash of breaking glass. Going
forward to Investigate he met Mosckos
coming up the companion way.
"It's all right," said the carpenter,
Tthat door was jammed and I had to

Rarely indeed does the commission make any at
tempt t6 protect the^ public, and as a rule the Com
' missioncrs / 4jraw theiV salaries in peace : undisturbed
by suits of plaintiffs asking for redress. The present
commission tried to earn its salary.-' It undertook in
good faith to put a stop to the extortion in oil rates.
So far as the results show, however, -it might just as
well have done nothing. It has given a decision, but
it cannot enforce it. From the start the new rates
were stopped by an injunction called "temporary."
That injunction stands till further orders. What has
the commission accomplished of. any "value to the oil
men or to the public? '.Â¦.:.''
Between now and the meeting of the Legislature
next winter there is ample time for business .'men
and lawyers of the State to confer on this subject and
devise a plan for clothing the commission with -power
to act. If that cannot be done the commission
should be abolished. There is no use; maintaining' a
scarecrow at so high a price.
they defy it.
State commerce, but in interstate commerce. In fact,
; they are everywhere apparent throughout the whole
field of trade and industry, and there is no question
. but some remedy must be devised to prevent them.
In California, as in other States, we have -sought
to provide the public with protection against railway
extortion by the creation of a Railway, Commission
clothed with power to investigate all complaints and
'.to do justice. This clothing of power which -the
Legislature bestowed upon the commission has been
torn to tatters and rags by the courts. At present
the commission shows an appearance not superior to
that of a scarecrow, and the railroads have lost re
spect for it. Either they control the commission or
smallest shipping stations. - They appear not only in
JUDGE HEBBARD'S decision sustaining the
temporary injunction against the enforcement
of the oil ra|es fixed by the' State- Railroad
Commission goes far to confirm the belief that the
commission is. not only useless but worse "than use
less. It not only wastes the money of the taxpayers
in paying salaries and expenses to a commission that
renders no service, but it leads litigants to waste their
money as well by holding out to them a promise that
they can obtain redress from extortionate railway
rates through the action of the commission. The
temporary injunction has been already running quite
a long while, and from present prospects it might be
just as well termed sn indefinite injunction.
It is time for the people of California to grapple
in earnest with the problem of railway regulation.
Under the present system the railways may impose
almost any kind of extortion that the traffic will bear
upon certajn kinds of goods and grant very low rates
to others. They- may discriminate in favor of .com
munities, or of private parties. They have it* in their
power to help or to hinder almost every industry in
the State. They, can cause some to flourish. They
can virtually destroy ethers. In this very cas^ of oil
rates the railroads have it in their power to' determine
whether or no the industries of California are to have
the benefit of cheap fuel; they can determine whether
the oil industry in the hands of its present owners, is
to be profitable or unprofitable.'
The evils of unrestricted railway domination in
matters of freight rates are well known. They are
manifest in every part of the Union from New Eng
land to the Pacific Ccast. Complaints against them
are heard in great cities like Chicago and from the
A USELESS COMMISSION.
PERSONAL MENTION.
PECULIAR INDUSTRY.
"I'll take two pounds of snake, please."
That is what one may hear at certain
stcres in Klamath Falls, Or., where there
Is ouite an extensive industry in snakes.
Children gather their aprons full of
snakes as they would of wild flowers and
little boys gather them* in their pockets
for pets. '>>
_ Thei; snake . industry o? Klamath Falls
came abotifin this fashion:
Postmaster Castli some time- ago re
ceived a letter from a concern- In Minne
sota asking- the" price of reptiles and in-
Quiring if they could be shipped to Minne
sota. Thinking it a Joke tho Postmaster
replied -that he would., furnish all tho
snakes desired at 23 cents a pound. Im
agine his surprise -when, by. return mail,
an order was received for 400 pounds of
snake. The Minnesota firm then informed
Lim that next season they would place aa
order for 800 pounds.
That set the people of Klamath Falls
to thinking, and the present snake indus
try of- the, town is the result of their
cogitations.
Tho species of water snake so plentiful
at Klamath Falls Is of a darrk color and
when fall' grown . about three feet long.
So great is the supply that tons of the
reptile? could be shipped annually If
there were orders for them. The snakes
are used for medicinal purposes, as a
superior quality of oil can be manufac
tured from the variety found at Klamafh
Falls.â Denver Times.
The French have coined the word alu

Treasurer's Clerk O. E. Darnell;
Miss Lulu Downtain, librarian in the
State Historical Society's museum and li
brary, who married a former Secretary of
State, W. A. Ohley; Miss Elizabeth Tay
lor, private secretary to the State Super
intendent of Free Schools, and two of the
assistant Janitors of the State House.
â¢ Since the present, administration went
into office, on March 4 last, the following
persons. connected with the State govern
ment have, been married: Auditor Ar
nold C. Scheer, who married Mi3s Minnie
Grose, for four years private secretary to
Sacrefary of State Dawson; Colonel C. B.
Kefauver, former Insurance Commission
er and- now brigade adjutant of the Na
tional Guard;. M. P. Shawkey, chief clerk
in the office of the State Superintendent
of Schools; J. B. Garvin of the State
Board of Agriculture; Miss Pearl Martin,
librarian -of the State, Historical Society,
and Miss Coral Long, stenographer to the,
adjutant general. â¢Â¦
This is a record which few if any State
Capitols can equal, and the cause has not
yet been determined. Perhaps an expta-
nation may be found in the fact that the
State pays liberal salaries and the -woTk
in the offices is light. Men who have
struggled along through poverty, hoping
the day might some time come when they
could afford, to marry and keep a wife
comfortably, when suddenly given a com
fortable salary very naturally think of
the realization of their hopes, while those
who have never had the opportunity to
give the married state a. thought find am
ple time when In the State's employ to
thtnk of matrimony.
If the present record Is maintained the
demand for State offices will no doubt in
crease until the list of applicants will be
appalling. Already there are several ap
plicants' for office at the election to fca
held three years from next fall, and tha
State has tesn advised to go into the busi
ness of conducting a matrimonial bureau
by fixing the term of office of the clerks
in the various departments at .three
months to one year.
If they 1 cannot succeed In marrying
within that length of time It will be con
sidered tnat they are Hopeless.
.that are left are rather self-conscious." '
Under the last administration Governor
Atkinson himself j started the j ball rolling
by marrying Mrs. MyraHornor Camdcn
of : Clarksburg: He : was the first' West
Virginia .Governor to wed. in. office, and
the reception, at the executive mansion
which fojlowed his return from the honey
moon was on as elaborate and lavish a
scale as any ever given In the State.. One
after another followed during: his
term of office, until it was suggested that
another, State official should be provided
for. by 'lawâ State /chaplain, who, it was
argued, could be paid by the fee system,
and would in that way have a very lucra-'
tlve office.

to the N rich resources of the -hitherto comparatively
neglected portions of the State is already half accom
plished/- Certainly it: has .been well begun. Repre
sentatives of all sections, of Northern California have
been brought to confer together, ..they have agreed
upon a plan of action ? in co-operation with represen
tatives of the : cpmrne'rcial r - organizations of the city,
a strong central board has been chosen to carry out

and enthusiasm has, been engendered to assure. hearty

been engaged . forbears in the, performance ,of just
such work as. is now required of it..- The new. move
ment is, in. fact, hardly _ any thing more than a strong
reinforcement of the board along lines in which it has

The Â¦ isthmian canal route - problem has ; been sim

It is held by lawyers and judicial officers. that this
decision applies also to 'all -anti-trust; laws which ex
empt labor unions that deny, transportation or free
dom'of the market to anti-trust products. Justice
HarlanY opinion voids Jhc anti-trust laws of Illinois,
Georgia,. Indiana, Louisiana. Michigan, Mississippi,
Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South 6akota,
Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. In each of those
States the law contains some form of exemption that
works its invalidation.. _ 1 ''"*C 1
their object the destruction of competition and the
control of prices, and that others of the general class,
also engaged in such tiade or commerce, shallnot be
bound to regard those regulations, but mayicombine
their capital, skill or acts to destroy competition and
to control prices for their benefit exclusively, is so
manifestly . a denial of the equal protection ' of the
laws' that extended argument to establish that posi
tion Â¦ would seem ; unnecessary."
"To declare that some of the general class engaged
in domestic trade or commerce shall be deemed
criminals if they violate certain regulations pre
scribed by the State for the purpose of protecting the
public against illegal combinations, which have for
; "This, section: is repugnant to the fourteenth
amendment of the constitution of the -United States,
and, further, it is so connected and interwoven with;
other sections of the act as to invalidate the entire
act. .If combinations of capital, skill, or acts, in re
spect of the. sale and purchase of goods, merchandise,
or commodities/ whereby the persons, firms, corpora
tions, or associations forming such combinations"
may control'or establish, in their the
prices of such goods, merchandise, or commodities,
are hurtful to the public interests', and should be sup
presscd.it is impossible to perceive why like combi
nations in respect of agricultural products and live
stock are not equally hurtful. Two or more engaged
in selling dry goods : or groceries,- or S meats; '.of\* fuel.r
or clothing, or' medicines, arc, . under tlie statute,
criminals, and subject to a fine, if they combine ' their :
capital, skill, or acts for the purpose of establishing,
controlling, increasing or reducing prices, or of pre
\enting free and unrestrained competition among
themselves, or others, in the sale of their goods or
rnerchandise; buttheir qeijjjibors, who happen to be .
agriculturists and'livestock raisers, may make com
binations of that character, in reference to their grain'
or livestock, without incurring *the prescribed pen
alty. Under what rule of permissible classification
can 1 such legislation be. sustained as consistent with
the equal protection of the laws?
The decision, written by Justice Harlan,-. "was. ! ad
verse to Connelly and voided the law. The Justice
admitted that if the statute were valid Connelly's plea
of non-liability was good, but, quoting the ninth sec
tion of the law, that "the provisions of this act shall
not apply to agricultural products or .livestock," I he
This law provided that if a man secured the"manu- :
factured product of a trust on crjedit he heed not
pay for- it.- The benefit of the collection laws was
therefore denied to a trust. This was adopted from
some of the earlier prohibition laws, which outlawed
all debts incurred in the purchase of -liquor, and
were upheld by the courts on the legai theory, that"
they were . necessary to A a proper exercise of Â¦'Â¦ the'
police powers of the State. The Illinois statute; has
recently come to judgment in the United States Su-,
preme Court and has been held void and Unconstitu
tional on account of its exemption clause* The case
arose in an action by the Union . Sewer Pipe Com
pany brought against Thomas Connelly and others.
Connelly secured a large amount of sewer pipe, and,
after getting possession, refused to pay for it under
the outlawing clause of the Illinois law. !
Illinois passed a much 'admired anti-trust law, but
put into ita clause, exempting from its -provisions
and penalties the, products of agriculture and live
stock. ' : r)\ ! . ' >l â¢' â¢â¢,'Â¦â¢
IT has been the custom in State Legislatures and
in Congress to exempt .certain classes from the:
operation of anti-trust laws. The r most Â¦ ordinary
exemption- is the labor .unions. 'The similarity of
some of the operations of these unions and the, trust
is shown in the strike in Boston/ in which hours and
wages were not an issue at all. The question; there
was a denial to transportation companies of 'the right
to handle and carry ncn-uhion freight. - The analogy-
between this and denial' of the right of merchantsftO'
handle non-trust products will be seen, at once. Â¦
InNjther cases anti-trust laws 4 exempt- certain'
classe.s of producers and of products. 'We omit; com-; !
iment upon the fact that in case of every exemption
the class favored controls many votes, and the effect
of the exemption is to give to a number privileges
which are denied to a few, and; it will worlc,
out in tW. denial of rights to a minority which the
majority is permitted to freely enjoy. It was apparf
ent from the beginning' to 'lawyers, -and -to^laymen
who have a proper comprehension s of our system r of
government, that these exemptions are to
our fundamental law, but such. considerations could
not restrain the legislative politicians who will cater
for votes/ no matter what: may be the law. or the" ef-"'
feet of statutory inequalities.

terday, in the ; United States Circuit Court
in hearing arguments on , motions' and de

a regular official ballot containing the
names of all the candidates.
The "independents" had requested the
printing of a ballot on the Australian
form." but the executive committee had
declined .to take notice of the request.
While the club had furnished the "regu
lar ballot," the "independents" Â¦ footed
the bill for their printed tickets and ap
pended a footnote to their ballots which
read as follows: â¢ a
This ticket is presented to the members of
the California Club as a choice of names for
directors of the California Club (incorporated)
for 1902-1IKK.
â¢ Judge A. R. Cotton, the club corporation at
torney, states that there can be no question
regarding the absolute legality of this ballot.
When the president read the regular
ticket at the -opening of the. election
there was a demand made that the inde
pendent ticket be also read, and -Mrs:
White did so. This was construed as a
victory by the "radicals." x
Each faction worked hard to secure
the election of its ticket. At the doors
to the building electioneering was carried
on and. arrivals of members -were eagerly
watched. r .
"Here is the regular ticket* the only
ticket to vote for," was the cry of some
of the ladies. â¢ . .
"Why; the idea," responded the opposi
tion. "Here isthe ticket that represents
the active members oftheclub."
When a member was "risked what In
ducements were held out to vote one of
the tickets, a fair, member said;
. "If we win, we will-.: supply tea and
cakes at every meeting." . â¢Â¦
. "We : will do better than that," replied
a Â¦ representative of the opposing faction,
"we will have tea, cakes and ice cream at
every meeting.".
.The badinage 'was, taken 'in; good' snirit
by the contestants; and though ' ; therrÂ»
were many -arguments \ as' to' the merits
of the two tickets, the ladies set an ex

The ballot boxes were open from 2.3a
P. m. until 6:30 p. m., and. during that
time considerable electioneering: was done
by the rival factions. â¢
The regular ticket, presented by the
nominating committee of the club, was
the one indorsed by the retiring presi
dent, Mrs. Lovell White, while the inde
pendent ticket was put forward by ten
ladies of the ciub who represented the
faction opposed to Mrs. White. .
For the first time in the history of. the
club there was a contested election, due
mainly tq the alleged arbitrary rulings of
Mrs. Lovell White and the interjection
of the "color line" into the_ select circles
of the organization.
The independent ticket practically fa
vored the recognition of the I much' de
bated question of allowing representation
of the colored race in the organization,
while the regular ticket was supposed to
represent the sentiments of the retiring
president and her followers, who had
made decided objection to receiving col

rooms were closed to any but members
during the election,- a vote being taken
on the matter previous to opening the

HEATED DEBATE
OVER SOUVENIR
Floral Societies NearJy
Fall. Out Over An
nual Publication. â¢
California Organization Ulti
mately Takes Charge v
\ of the Matter. â¢
The ladles of the California State Flora!
Society and /the members of the Pacific
Coast 'Horticultural Society held a Joint
meeting in the rooms of the Harbor Com
missioners yesterday . and - incidentally
quarreled over a souvenir that is to
be got out for the May floral show. Mrs.
J.R. Martin led the forces of the floral
society and lost her temper a dozen times
trying to explain the dlfllculties of getting
out a souvenir.,: J.W. Bagge, H. Plath
and William Eldred- were present In the
Interests of the .horticultural society.
It "appeared from the proceedings that
Mrs. Martin had sent a letter to the hor
ticultural society stating that she would
attend to getting out the annual souvenir
which is to" be distributed at the coming
show. In the letter she stated that she
had gone ahead with the work. The hor
ticulturists felt hurt /that Â¦â¢Mrs.. Martin
had not consulted them in the matter, and
sent their' representatives to the meeting
to express disapproval. They wanted the
matter, turned over to a printer who
would secure ; advertisements, lasue the
pamphlet and give the organization 20 per
cent of the profit. One of the members
made a statement to that effect, and Mrs.
Martin- took a firm stand in -the matter.
During the discussion Plath suggested
that the horticultural society's delegates
ought tp withdraw from the meeting, and
they. were pn the point. of doing so when
Miss Eastwood smoothed affairs.
One delegate said to Mrs. Martin: "You
might manage the whole; show, but you
can't manage the Pacific Coast Horticul
tural Society," while another delegate re
marked, "That there was lots of money
to be made out of a -souvenir," but sub
sided when Mrs. Martin testily said, "You
don't know anything of the kind. Thero
was never a dollar made out of it."
-Upon motion of M1&3 Eastwood the Cal
ifornia State Floral Society is to under
take the work of getting out the book.
The society Is to bear the expense, if
there is any. and the horticultural so
ciety is to be : relieved of any responsi
bility.
& Co. Early In last year lÂ£ waa decided to
signalize the occasion by presenting to em
ployes r. silver medal as a token of the com
- pany's appreciation of their zeal and fidelity

It is now a settled fact that dandruff
is caused by a germ.' Falling hair and
baldness are the' result of dandruff.' â¢ Dr.
E. J. Baardsley of Champaign, 111., got
ho'd of the new hair preparation, New-
bro's Herpicideâ the only one that kills
the- dandruff germ. He says: "I used
Hcrpieide for my dandruff and ' falling
hair, and I am well satisfied with the re-
sult." Dr. J. T. Fugate of Urbana, 111.,
says: "I have used Herpicide for dan-
druff witlv-^xcellent results. I shall pre-

Cures After Failures of

Has Wrought Thousands of
To-day kidney disease is as common as
rheumatism. Thousands of men and
women living in fancied security have
kidney trouble in some form that must de-
velop from day to day Â¦ and end in death
unless wise and proper treatment is at
once taken advantage ot.' , .-,
. Have you any of the following symp-
toms: Backache, frequent urinating, flut-
tering of the heart, nausea. . vomiting, a
dry. harsh skin, fever, coated tongue, ex-
treme thirst, fickle appetite, acid bitter
taste, deposit of mucus after .urination.
sour stomach, dropsical swelling, loss of
memory, scalding: sensations and consti-
pation? If you experience â¢ any of these
symptoms begin at onca with Paine's Cel-
ery Compound, which will quickly put to
flight all symptoms of disordered kidneys.
It is nature's true remedyâthe only one
you can rely upon with certainty of cure.
Mr. Albert Bowers, S4 North Thirteenth
street, Newark. N. J., writes: "Some two
years ago I Buffered from kidney disease,
during; which time I had two doctors,
neither of whom could do me any good. It
was not until I used Palne's Celery Com-
pound that I found relief. I had no
strength, energy or ambition, and was
nervous and Irritable. I waa all run down
and lost about forty pounds. I felt that
the. end was near, when a 'friend suggest-
ed Paine's Celery Compound, and I have
this great medicine to thank for my res-
toration to health." . .

NEW YORK, March 18.â The recent charac
ter of the stock market was; not materially
changed to-day. Speculative Incursions into
the field of the usually important stocks were
few and desultory in character, j Now and
then a seemingly active buying movement
would develop In tome stocks that have been
occasionally a market leader In the past, but
the activity would as suddenly subside and the
dealings revert to some rarely active stock.
The high priced specialties continued in favor
to-day and a number o? low, priced Industrials
also were brought up to a considerably higher
level of prices. â¢ The minor railroads were less
conspicuous, although a few of these continued
to show. wide movements. There were declines
on profit taking in these classes as well us. the
new strong points. The most conspicuous
movement of this kind was in North American
which Jumped about In an erratic manner In
the course of a sensational advance of 14%
points on unusually heavy "dealings. The move
ment was without explanation beyond the long
time gossip of the availability of the company's
comprehensive charter â¢ rights â¢ for the pur
poses of some great ' consolidation â¢ scheme.
Other stocks not usually prominent which show
striking advances were American and .Conti
nental Tobacco â¢ preferred, . General Electric,
Colorado Fuel and American Cotton Oil. Among
the more prominent stocks Amalgamated Cop
per continued active and found support after
the recent heavy decline. ' Much of the buying
was attributed to the. demand from shorts to
cover.' Sugar, on the oth/ir hand, was reac
tionary on account of the dispute over the re
duction of the tariff < on Cuban sugars. . An
Instance of the disposition to take Â¦ profits on
good news wan the selling of Pacific Mail, on
the passage .of the ship. subsidy bill by -the
Senate. . The New. York public ;utilitles also
suffered from profit taking after some : early
advance. Lackawanna made a charact#ristic
advance of 7 points and the gains In the other
coalers ran between 1 and 2 points. The mod
erating of the weather In the West had some
influence in causing higher prices, although the
late riee in the wheat market somewhat modi
fled this influence.- -.Aside from . these Â° cases
the movements of the day were almost entirely
due to the individual causes. , " Â¦ ..

holders ask 2%c. Spot Oregon prunes are in
demand, with 3p-40s reported scarce and firmly
held. Coast advices note a continued strength
in the situation, but that market is above the
rarity of spot cost to lay down here. and. wo
hear of no purchases for shipment to the trade
here. In currants the feeling is easy, and
while tve hear of no business under 5%c for
fine Amelias uncleaned in barrels the lack of
important buying Interest on that basis has
a tendency to depress conditions. Spot holdings
are scattered, and despite the strong situation

show a fair interest for Valencia layers, with
the market firm at 7%c California loose Is

In apricots the market is strong, with an up

Ftcady and a fair jobbing demand is reported.
, Figs are active and firmer for both bags and
layers. In nuts a fair buySjig Interest is noted
In Brazils on the lower basis. Naples walnuts
are very firmly held at 12c. with a tendency

reported in French and Marbot walnuts. Fil

Leaving the missions, Mr. - iKnowland
spoke of the buildings and scenes that are
memorable as being connected with the
transfer of California from Mexico to
American rule. The foremost of. these
buildings, he said, was the old Custom
house at Monterey,- where Â¦ Commodore
Sloat raised the first , United States
flag that ever ' floated In this
State. He told how the historic
building had been placed under the care
of the Native Sons and how they were
having it repaired and the surrounding
grounds beautified, with a garden. He
showed a picture of the ruins of Sutler's
Fort and told of the : hospitality, which
was always dealt out to the early settlers
by old-Sutter. He. described the hazard
ous attempt that was made by the Don
ner. party to reach California and,dis
played an illustration of Donner Lake/

bleak winter when so many heroic ' men
and women perished on Its margin.; â¢Â¦

that one could journey -from San- Diego

This adjustment whereby the less rate "ia
allowed on reshipment originating at points
west of St. Louis certainly conforms to tha
real purposes of the interstate commerce law,
which are publicity and equality. There has
been neither secrecy nor unjust discrimination
in its application. I apprehend that we .will
have no difficulty In showing that there Has
been full compliance with the law. . .
The indictment alleges that this company
has violated the law by charging a rate of 21
cents per 100 pounds on grain from Loulsvilla
to Atlanta, when tariff rate was 24 cents.
The fact Is that a proportionate rate of thres
cents per 10O pounds less than the local tariff
rates, has for a great many yeara been applied
by all railroads operating from Louisville and
Cincinnati to southeastern territory upon grain
originating at points west of St. Louis and re
shlpped from Louisville to Cincinnati and
the shipments referred to in the indictment
were of this character. This less rate on such
reshipments Is an open and public rate, ap
plicable and applied alike to all.
. Concerning the accusation on which tha
indictment is based. Vice President Hinaa
of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad
said:
There are two counts In the bill, which
sets forth that in two. Instances the road
granted a rebate of 3 cents. The wit

It is estimated that the loss to . the
transcontinental roads will amount to
very nearly half a million dollars. This
estimate takes into consideration only the
actual loss to the roads by reason of dam
age to perishable freight and the cost of
clearing, the, roads. . The roads will,, of
course, suffer from the loss of passenger
traffic, but â¢ just how heavily it Is Impos
sible to say. The movement of new set
tlers was begun at least a month earlier
this 'year than last and the blockade of
snow has put a sudden check to this
traffic. - The entire damage may run into
the millions. Â¦ Â¦/:;; ."â¢.-;_:Â¦Â¦â-..: â¢: =.
The loss of life and property I caused by
the storm is still largely a matter of con
jecture. But five authenticated cases of
loss of human life have so far been re-,
ported. There are rumors that there have
been lives lost among the new^ettlers,
but these lack confirmation. The percent
age of loss to livestock upon the ranges
is far from being accurately known. Ks
timates range from 2 to 60 per cent and It
will be . some days before anything like
accurate figures can be obtained.
The Soo- Pacific road, which is a s.ufferer
from the effects of the storm, is making
a great effort to reopen traffic, but has
only partially succeeded. No reports have
been received as to situation upon the
Canadian Pacific line, which was blocked
for several hundred miles. Â¦ .
The officials have met with so many
mishaps in their efforts to get a clear
track" that they will not make any state
ment as to the resumption of traffic until
trains are actually moving. It was thought
last night that the road would be clear
by this morning, but the accidents to
and ' derailment of the gigantic rotary
plows delayed the work. .The Great
Northern officials also say that they hope
to have their trains running before morn
ing, but -they make no positive promise
to that effect. .- â¢
Advices received at the Northern Pa
cific office In this city at 10 o'clock to
night were : to " the effect that the snow
plows working east and west from Bis
marck and" Jamestown were in sight of
each other and that it now | seemed pos
sible that trains would be again running
to-night.

with the Building Trades Council, as most
of Its members are engaged in bridge
building work. Some of the members ob
ject to the discrimination made against
them by the Building Trades Council,
which only recognizes the Derrickmen's.
Engineers' and Structural Iron Workers'
Union. An " effort Is now being made to
adjust the matter, as the number of new
buildings going up in the city/has made
a great demand for men conversant with
this class of work.
. An open meeting of the Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners will be held on
Thursday night at Metropolitan Temple,
to consider the present situation. J. P.
Grimes, the national president, will de
liver an address, v. -,v 5, ,-V.
Resolved, That the Builders* Protective'As
sociation at. a special ' meeting assembled de
plore the action of the. Building Trades Coun
cil in interfering with and obstructing -the
building Industries of this city by demanding
the discharge of other union men. and if said
action is continued this association will loo'k
upon said Building Trades Council as an
enemy to the building trades and Industries
of this city and will call upon the members of
the Builders' Protective Association to take
such action as will effectually protect the pub
lic and members of this association against Its
interference. . i
Deplore Action of Trades Council.
At a meeting of the Builders' Protective
Association, held on Monday at 318 Bush
street, the following resolution was
adopted: ,
W. H. Goff, president of the San Fran
cisco Labor Council, and also of Carpen
ters' Union 4S3, . said he did not Â¦ know
anything about the details of the suit.
He t-aid the matter was entirely in the
hands -of Attorney Hutton and Business
Agent Cole.
If Carpenters' Union No. 483 wants to bring
the troubles of Its members Into court it has
a perfect right to do bo. But there is nothing
in the suit at all. If the members of the Build
ing Trades Council .. decline to work on . the
same Job with a member of Carpenters' Union
No. 4S3 that is their privilege. The only card
that will be recognized in the building trades
is that of the Building Trades Council, In
junction or no injunction. As to the damages,
well, I think they will have a hard time col
lecting them, if they are ever allowed.
Â« P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build
ing Trades Council, was not disposed to
give the matter any serious consideration
last night, and said he did not know any
thing about the suit, as he had not as
yet been served with a summons or the
writ of injunction. He' said: â¢
The suit filed yesterday was com
menced by W. A. Coles, business agent of
Carpenters' Union No. 483. ] The com
plaint alleges that there are over 600
members belonging to the union, and that
they have been seriously injured by the
boycott instituted against them by the
Building Trades Council. An injunction
was asked and later granted, directed
against P. H. McCarthy and other mem
bers of the Building Trades Council and
the District Council of Carpenters. Dam
ages through enforced loss ' of work are
demanded. â¢ The monetary value of the
loss of wages is fixed at $300,000.
Says There Is Nothing in the Suit.
After an exchange of a series of reso
lutions and, retorts the situation became
more and more strained. Men carrying
the card of the Building Trades Council
refused to work with those of Carpenters'
Union No. 4S3, the -members of which
carry the card of the San Francisco La
bor Council, with which it is affiliated.
borne time ago the Building Trades
Council decided that no man carrying a
card of one of the unions affiliated with
that council should work' on' the same
job with men not bearing the Building
Trades card. Carpenters' Union No. 4b3
and one or two minor unions were out
side the pale of the Building Trades
Council and the members of these unions
found they could not get work.
The complications existing between
Carpenters' Union No. 4S3 and the Build-
Ing Trades Council were added' to yester
dayyby the filing of a suit for $300,000 dam
ages. An injunction was also asked for
against the Building Trades Council. and
its executive officers. As soon as the' suit
was filed. by H. W. Hutton; attorney for
Carpenters' Union No. 4S3, j the papers
were rushed to Presiding Judge Dunne,
and by him assigned to Judge Seawell. A
temporary restraining order was then Is
sued. None of the members of the execu
tive committee of the Building Trades
Council had been served with the re
straining order up to a late hour last
night. - â¢Â¦Â»-. â¢
Amorsen announced afterward that his
â¢nd of the purse was $51 50. The loser got
nothing but the laundry.
After a lot of preliminary sparring and
sidestepping, in which neither of the con
testants landed an effective punch, the
German laundryman succeeded in get
ting in one in the region of Lieutenant
Crockett's pocket.
At all events Lieutenant Crockett's
laundry, which was carried to the wash
house by several army mules, was a wel
come Bight to Amorsen. The laundry
was finally washed and done up In those
nice packages with the beautiful flourish
to the name. Everything was there. The
proverbial figures on the bundle which
usually drive many to drink after dress
ing up on Saturday night were not for
gotten by the suave laundry magnate.
Then Lieutenant Crockett was sent lor.
He came, and the fun began, ' Th'e man
of arms took one searching- look at the
amount scribbled .on the first bundle and
it nearly took his breath away. He didn't
stop to look at the remaining figures. He
eimply flew out of the German washhouse
Â£0 fast that he nearly carried a section
of the door away with him. When he
came back the laundrymen say that
Lieutenant Crockett looked a* if he waa
lugging one of the forward guns of the
Meade around with him. At any rate he
made the laundry look like a Filipino
blockhouse after a three months' siege.
\Vhen the trouble was all over the laun
drymen counted fours and then took
stock. Lieutenant Crockett failed to
answer roll call and the laundry was not
in evidence to bo checked up. Then the
laundry man and the military man' went
before Colonel Ray with their troubles.
Lieutenant Crockett was Amorsen's star
customer. "Hoff gourde," explains Amor
sen, "ve hadt troubles 'e little bit ven
ce Meade vent avay virst, put ve fix
that all hup pefore de Meade got out py
ue heads."
Amorsen, the laundryman, opened up
"Jf^l Â°1. a J* 1 *Â® scale on ine islan^
vhen the Meade went into quarantine,
lie knew; that a white shirt seemed un
clean after two minutes' wear, espe
cially when there was smallpox around,
and asÂ»for the underclothesâ well, Amor
sen put all his ready coin into a washing
plant ana when he erected it on the
iMana all the Meade's passengers put
their ready xinen and underwear sfAd some
that wasn't ready into the laundlf,. Busi
ness was brisk and Amorsen. wta.-is a
thrifty German, kept Bogle O'DMnell's
eteam launches busy carting flat irons
a^d fat laundry girls across the bay to
the laundrv.
The closing hours of the days of quar
antine to which the luckless passengers
of the transport Meade " were subjected
were studded with a rare spasm of com
edy brought about by a wrangle over an
unpaid laundry bill. George Amorsen, a
laundry agent with a keen eye to busi
ness, and Lieutenant Crockett of the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, who has a large
laundry list and the same opinion of
laundrymen in general that a flat owner
enjoys of plumbers in particular, were
the principal actors in the thrilling and
at the same time amusing bit of realism
that was enacted en Angel Island yes
terday morning.

"The next day I began to use Postum
â¢regularly, and before the first package
had been entirely used I discovered the
most encouraging symptoms. The dys-
peppia and headaches which I had ' been
subject to daily entirely disappeared, also
tbe distressing vomiting spells.; The
bowels improved steadily and regularly.
"I ate cautiously, but was sustained by
the Postum Coffee. After the first pack-
ege I tried it with milk, then with cream,
without experiencing the least inconve-
nience. Of course, I was delighted and
the future looked bright. From that first
experience up to date my health has been
eplendid. I have increased in weight from
139 to 1S7 pounds, and can digest, any thing
I desire. I can say. honestly and. cheer-'
fully that I would recommend "Postum to
any one Buffering the tortures of dyspep-
"My first taste of Postum was about 10
o'clock one morning. I did not dare to
take cream with It, for I knew what the
result would be with my stomach. That
is, I thought I did. I have since learned
that cream can be taken In Postum even
by bad dyspeptics, but I had my first
taste with only hot water in It and a lit-
tle sugar. The second cup followed the
first and a third followed the second. I
took my departure munching some of. the
dry grains of Postum, as I was deter-
mined to investigate Its effects thorough-
ly. That day I had no dinner and expe-
rienced no distressing* sensations; on < the
contrary, felt as though my appetite had
been appeased.
. "I had been afflicted for years with
chronic dyspepsia, and all the medicines
I had tried "were in vain. One by one I
had to leave them off, and was In despair
as to what I should. do for- relief.
"About five years ago, when I . was a
miserable dyspeptic, I first heard of Pos-
tum Cereal Coffee and put It to a careful
test.
. A Chicago man, Peter G. Hoist, at 315
Enjjlewood avenue, writes: "Reading" ia
the paper the other day something about
Postum Cereal, it awoke in me a reminis-
cent vein.
Coffee is a "killer" for many people,
and, of course, when left off the user will
probably regain a degree of health with-
out any outside help, but when Postum
Food Coffee is used the return to health
is much more rapid, for Postum is a. dis-
tinct and well defined health builder, with
a deliciou3 coffee flavor and a beautiful
deep brown color, that changes to golden
brown when cream Is added.
"V%Tien a person has been shown that a
change In food or drink can make and
keep oiie well it Is a thing not likely to be
forgotten.

to-day from Rev. J. W. Â¦ Horsley. who, as
former: chaplain of Clerkenwell â¢ Prison,
has bsen.in contact with 100.000 criminals
Rev. Mr. Horsley had traced many of the
crimes he. had investigated to betting,
which, â¢ . he declared, -was due to the ex
ample of the aristocracy. .. Â¦
"If," he said. "the. Kin* would say to

The City Council at a recent meeting
authorized the Tax Collector to m?e that
the license money was paid. Superintend
ent Jaynes of the telegraph companywd*
advised of this action and has written: a
letter to the' city officials flatly refusing
to pay and announcing that If the com
pany- is given-further trouble its 8an Ka
fael ofllrf wilt be abolished and the wlr*-H
removed from the city. Superintendent
Jayne*s claims that 'his company pays' no
city license anywhere in the United States.
SAN RAFAEL, March 13.â There is a
fight oh "between the city of San, Rafael
and -the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany.: The corporation has announced
that if it Is compelled to pay a city licTRae
it will abolish its ofHce here and remove
its wires from the city.
The trouble grows out of the determina
tion of the Cily Trustees to collect a li
cense from the Western Union Company.
For some time there has been in exist
ence an ordinance empowering the City
Tax ' Collector to collect from each tele
phone or telegraph company doing busi
ness here. the sum of WO a quarter. -The
Tax Collector has frequently presented^
his bill to the Western Union Company,
but in each instance has met a rebuff. ,

Max Heinrich, the famous basso, who'
first visited this city with the Thomas
Orchtstra some fifteen years ago, was an
actor on the German stage before coming
to America. After his arrival in this
country he took up music as a profes
sion. -having previously studied it thor
oughly as an- amateur. Now that Eu
rope has gone Richard Strauss mad. h!s
works creating even more discussion than
did even Wagner's, Heinrich has
taken, up' the wonderful melodramatic
music composed by Strauss to accompany
Tennyson's "Enoch Arden," and has been
making it a feature of his concerts. Hein
rich reads, or rather acts, the poem
while his daughter. Miss Julia Heinrich,
does the difficult melodramatic accompa
niment at the piano. It is said to be a
most artistic performance and will no
doubt draw large audiences to Sherman
&,Clay Hall, where they will give this
work the night of Tuesday. April 1 and

White finally spied Officer McNamara
on the crossing, and the two went over to
the Fidewalk in front of the entrance to
the Emporium. They caught the .fellows
right in the act of holding up a man
and demanding money. The police officer
nabbed one and White the other. Both
were big. strong men and showed a dispo
sition to resist arrest, but finally con
cluded to go along quietly.
. They insisted that they were merely
begging and claimed that they had never
been under arrest before. OfQcer Farley
Â¦was summoned to assist in order that the
safe-keeping of the prisoners might be in
sured until the arrival of the patrol
wagon.
They were taken to the City Hall sta
tion and charged with begging, although
it is expected that a more serious charge
will be placed against them later. They
grave their names as J. J. Nolan and John
Collins.
White says that he first noticed them
in front of the Cafe Royal. His attention
was drawn to them by seeing them crowd
a pedestrian against the building and de
mand money. One of them had a grip on
the victim's coat and the other placed his
body in a position to preclude the possibil
ity of retreat. The man wrenched himself
away by the exertion of considerable
force, and the two criminals proceeded up
the Etreet.
â¢ Between the Cafe Royal and the Empo
rium the rascals held up five other men
in the same way. Taken by surprise and
frightened at the aspect of their assail
ants some of them were forced to make
contributions.
Two exceptionally bold offenders were
landed in the City Prison yesterday morn-
Ing through the agency of Secretary
White of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. The men were
operating on Market street in broad day
light. They were ostensibly begging, but
in realty they were holding up passers
by. -

"Nothing;" he answered, "except that

A communication' 'was received 1 by the

Henry Ach, attorney for the Cafe Royal,
pleaded hard for his clients. He accepted
the flat of the commission as -gracefully
as he could, but he- tried hard to get the
commission to go on record as to what
kind of card games would be allowed in
saloons. Commissioner Hutton told him
that it was the sentiment of the commis
sion that games of cards for money . in
saloons were against" the best. Interests of
the city, and it was in pursuance of that
policy that the Cafe Royal application
had been denied. The Week of grace
given in order to allow ". the Cafe Royal
people to- decide was considered time
enough and the promise was made that
no prosecutions would' be undertaken
during the interval. 'Â¦â¢ , ;;â¢ ;
* The proprietor of the Baldwin .Annex
was willing to promise - that the card
games in his . resort would ; be . entirely
separated from the saloon business if his
application for a license was granted.'but
the commission made the same ruling. in
his. case as in the Cafe Royal and the ap
plication in its present form, was denied.
Commissioner Howell said his under
standing of the caucus determination was
that the applicants would be given an op
portunity to conduct legitimate- saloon
business, disassociated from card games
entirely, and if this condition. was violated
no liquor licenses were to *be granted for
the- premises.- Commissioner . Mahoney
thought that in its present form "the ap
plication of the Cafe Royal could; not be
granted. He suggested that it.be denied,
but that one week be given for the filing
of a new application that would stipulate
that no card games for money would be
allowed on the premises. - "
"Well, I don't agree with that," said
President Newhall. "The^e people have
had two years in which to rectify the ob
jectionable features of their piaces and
they have not done eo. I know, because
1 have visited the resorts." ,

"Oh, no; that isn't- my understanding of
it at all. I think that -we agreed tnat the
Cate Koyal proprietors were to. have one
week. in which to decide whether or not
they would conduct a retail liquor busi
ness witnout the adjunct or poker games.
If they agree . to'rcontine tnelr business
noleiy to Belling liquor then we are to
grant them licenses ror these premises."
President Ncwhall was inclined to deny
the applications peremptorily and to grant
no respite. He took tins position in an-,
nouncing the decision of tne commission,
which was reached in caucus r/ionday
night. Evidently Â¦ the determination I of
the Commissioners was â¢ not thoroughly
understood among themselves, us at the

By a ruling of "the Police Commission
rendered last night the Cafe* Royal and
the Baldwin Annex :will have to conduct
their .liquor business without the - poker
games, which . have ': made both places no
torious, if they desire to "secure renewals
of their licenses. The applications in
their present forms were denied and one

This version will "be . rejected in Oakland,

culed in the. classic precincts of Berkeley.
The .other version, that the. Collector
neglected golf to engage In politics, -will
be accepted. The flatter version can be
very.: well sustained without Impugning
the veracity. of the Collector/ The simple
declaration can.be made that he changed
his mind after surveying. the golf-links
and the political, situation. Examples'of

troversy with bewildering swiftness, and
why should not the privilege of a: change
be accorded to the Collector? The theory
that the Collector saw Bulla. Tom Hughes

The man whose arrest is sought called
at Schwartz's store Saturday evening and
presented a certificate of deposit for $1/5
upon the Crocker- Woolworth Bank made
out for John Brooks. He said â¢ he was
Brooks, and as. he wanted a suit of
clothes ana some money he would 'leave
the certificate with Schwartz till Mon
day morning, when he would go with him
to the bank and cash the certificate, nc
got cash and clothes to the valuw of $53 75
and indorsed the certificate, leaving it
with Schwartz. Â¦ â¢
The man called at thevstore Monday
morning and went with Schwartz to the
bank. The certificate was produced and
the money demanded. The cashier said
that John Brooks, the depositor, was a
colored man, but the man had the cool
ness to insist that he was the depositor.
He was asked to sign his name, and he
did so several times. Â£ The cashier said .the
signature was not that of John Brooks,
but as the man was insistent he was told
to : return at 12 o'clock. He promised to
meet Schwartz at 12 o'clock," but failed to
make his appearance. ' .. . ', Â¦ -
Schwartz reported the matter to' the po
lice, and it was discovered that the cer
tificate belonged to John Brooks, colored,
a former soldier, who roomed at the In
ternational Hotel and who was. sent to the
