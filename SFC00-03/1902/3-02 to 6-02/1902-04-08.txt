The burning ship kept afloat until about

caused by an explosion. We could see
the flying sparks, and the illumination. â¢
which was visible all night, was of that

to the water's edge. That is the whole
story of the loss of the Frankistan, ona

have, made big headway in the cargo,

other explosion and the flames and smoke
were issuing from the ventilator holes In
every direction. Captain Atkinson saw
that the ship was doomed and consulted
with the crew as to the next course to be
taken. The schooner H. C. Wright hove

to desert the Frankistan and take refuge

plain that she would be destroyed within

was decided to stick to the ship so long
as she would carry us. We hoped to
keep the fire under subjection until we
reached Saii Francisco, but this was im
possible* as it turned out. The fire was

W.. WASHINGTON, April 7.-Every pre
caution will be taken to guard the Presi
dent, who started this afternoon Â¦ at 3:30
o'clock to South Carolina to' visit : the
Charleston Exposition. The assassination
of President McKlnley at the Buffalo Ex
position is too fresh in 'the minds of of
ficials to permit of atiy negligence. Be
sides, Roosevelt Is not so averse to police
protection as was his predecessor. A
number of Washington detectives are al
ready at the exposition clearing the path
of the chief executive. Co-operating with
the Charleston police, they are rounding
up all suspicious characters. The train
upon which the President is traveling has
aboard half a dozen of Chief Wilkle's
most trusted secret service men. They
will keep close to the President during the
entire tour and will scrutinize every per
son'who approaches him. . '
Attired In plain clothes, these detectives
.will surround the President at. all times
and especially when he is In the midst of
throngs or in any public place. Any one
who falls, under suspicion will be examin
ed' closely and put away for safe keep-
Ing. ,
For three weeks the police arangements
have been in preparation. At that time
Officers Helan and McNamee of the
Washington detective force went to
Charleston and consulted Â¦ with - officials
there regarding the necessity for avoiding
a repetition of the Buffalo tragedy. 7
REPORT OF A PLOT.
Chief Wilkie 'said that since the visit of
the Washington men, the Charleston
police have been keeping close track of all
suspicious characters who appeared in.' the
city.- The Federal secret service has been
augmenting this work by keeping a close

It was reported this morning that. Chief
Wilkie had received information- that
anarchistic circles in Patcrson had.se
lected a member to go to Charleston and
kill the President if possible. Wilkie, how
ever, denied this report. He said extra
precautions were being taken merely on'
general principles. , At the exposition
grounds no person will be permitted to
approach the President who carries
bundles of any kind. \The police will also
insist that persons moving near Roosevelt
cannot walk, with their hands in their
pockets. Both hands must be in full view.
The personnel of the party bound for
Charleston is as follows : President and
Mrs. Roosevelt. Attorney General and
Mrs. Knox, Secretary "Wilson, Commander
W. S. Cowles of the navy and Mrs. Cowles
and Dr. John F. Urle.
CHEERED AIT DEPARTURE.
The party, is traveling in a special train
over the Southern Railroad. There was a
large crowd at the station. The President
was driven to tire Sixth-street entrance
Instead of B street, where most people" ex

laughing with Mrs. Roosevelt and Com
mander Cowles, his brother-in-law. Sec
retary Hitchock and a number of other
Government officials were'there to bid the
President good-by. A lar*e number of
secret service men and detectives were
scattered about the station. The crowd
cheered the President heartily. As the

DANVILLE, Va., April 7.â President
Roosevelt's journey through Virginia has
been marked by extreme cordiality and
enthusiasm and he has shown the keen
est interest In the historic â¢ country
through which the train is passing. His
first remarks were addressed to a. small
crowd at Rappahannock, where the train
made a short stop for water. He appeared
on the rear platform and after bowing
his acknowledgments . said to ; the little
gathering: "I am. now upon historic,
ground." ...'.-. . . ':
At Charlottesville . the people were out
in force, the driving rain not seeming to
dampen. their spirits In. the least. In the
crowd were a number of Spanish, war

convicted Australian officers belonging to
that corps, since disbanded, murdered
from thirty-five to forty persons. As an
instance of their . cold-bloodedness, the
trooper relates how three Dutch children,
2 and 12 years of age, respectively, and
their little sister, arrived. at the carbi

given food. The girl and one of the boys
were wounded: The injured ' boy took
his little brother on his back and. was

APPEAL FOR GIFTS.
LONDON, April 7.-A dispatch from
Lord Kitchener, dated Pretoria, says
Commandant Kritslnger, who was,cap
tured by General* French at Hanover
Road, Cape Colony. December 17 last,
and who has been tried by court-martial
on the charge of having committed four
murders, in addition to the train- wrecking
and cruelty to prisoners, has been ac
quitted and is being well treated as an
ordinary prisoner of war.
Lord Kitchener reports that the Boer
casualties during the engagement of
March 31 and April 1 were, at the lowest
estimate, thirty men killed and eighty
wounded.
Commandant Erasmus was killed near
Boshoff, Orange River Colony, April 3.
KRITSINGER IS ACQUITTED.
"All sides," he says, "now agree that
intervention would provoke a war too
dreadful to contemplate. The Boers can
continue their present form of resistance
for years."

EUROPE KEPT AT BAY.
"When the trouble over Cuba came I
cannot believe America would have faced
the war that ensued if she had not been
assured the navies of Europe would be
kept at bay while she proceeded to riddle
the decrepit fleets of Spain. Chamberlain's
family ties may have, taken him to the
United States at a time when both nations
contemplated war, but perhaps they were
not so urgent as to prevent the transac
tion of official business at *he same time.
"I do not mean to say that Chamberlain
gave or received assurances on that oc
casion, but the question as to whether he
did or "did not is both grave and suggest
ive in the light of recent history." .
BERLIN, April 7.â Before leaving here
for home to-day Dr. Kuyper, Premier of
The Netherlands, made the suggestion
that the assurances of British support
during the Spanish war were the price
of America's non-intervention In South
Africa. The Dutch Minister associates
the \-isit paid to the United States by
Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secre
tary, before the outbreak of hostilities
with Spain with the official attitude of
the Washington Government toward . the
Boer cause.
â¢'America's position is anomalous," said
Kuyper. "The hearts of the American
people unquestionably beat in full sym
pathy with the Boers, and yet the Gov
ernment at Washington is immovable.
Notwithstanding the ministerial assur
ances that England foresaw war In South
Africa long before Kruger issued his ulti
matum, she would never have provoked
that ultimatum unless fairly certain of in

amendment was adopted adding to the
bill's definition of .Chinese those of mixed

the main features of the minority bill had
been placed in the majority bill, and in

not entitled to admission to the United
States or into the portion of the territory
of the United States to which the vessel
plies, and any violation of this provision
shall be punishable by a fine not exceed
ing, $2000."
Clark made a 6trong plea for the amend
ment, declaring that the purpose of the
exclusion bill was to protect American
labor. His amendment, he said, was to
protect American Bailors. The amend
ment wu subsequently broadened to pro
vide for the temporary employment of
Chinese sailors where a vessel in distress
has lost part of her crew.
Against the modified amendment Per
kins of New York raised the point of or
der that It was not germane, and Moody
of Massachusetts sustained the point, but
in the course of his ruling indicated how
the amendment might be made germane.
Thereupon Kahn of California modified
the amendment to make It conform to the
ruling of the chair, his modified amend

Hltt vigorously opposed the amendment.
He declared that such a. provision would
drive the American ships on the Pacific
tirder the British flag. .
Clark gave notice that if the provision
was defeated he would offer it as an
amendment to the ship subsidy bill.
Cannon agreed witn Hitt that the adop

not do so until the provision prohibiting

Hitt shared to a certain extent the
views of Kleburg. but thought the pro

that the question raised might be passed
upon in the court*.
Nappen's motion was lost.
Two amendments were adopted without
division, one by Clark of Missouri to
amend the definition of "teacher" under
the privileged classes so as to require
that for two years before admission the
teacher should have been engaged in
"teaching the higher branches," and an
other by Coombs of California to provide
that Chinese students shall leave the
country Immediately upon the completion
. of their course of study.

". tire valley is white with blooms
and the orchards never looked prettier.
The Santa Clara County Improvement

a success and to-night its officials are
confident, that -from' 10,000 to 20,000 visitors
will attend. : Â¦ \ " .
The sight of thousands of acres of
peach, anricot, cherry and prune trees Is
a novelty that is worth going miles to

which there are no end, these flowering
groves line both sides and give off a per
fume that scents the entire valley. ! Np

seeing everything, for there will be ,vari
ous committees to conduct them around.
A programme of sightseeing has been ar
ranged under the auspices of the improve
ment club, of which V. A. Scheiler is
president and D. M. Burnett secretary.
Besides all the members taking a deep
interest in the festival, a special commit
tee is in charge of ; affairs, composed pÂ£
the following: V. A. Scheiler. (chairman),
J. D. Radford, Paul Shcup, H. D. Ma

southwest of San Jose, in the foothills. A
fine programme of literary and musical
exercises, with luncheon and all kinds of
sports, will be presented by the Saratoga
Improvement Club. Hon. M. II. Myrick
of San Francisco will deliver an address
and there will be speaking by others. Rev.

Then there will be drives about the or
chards and to Congress Springs.

ranged it so that persons who, come here

A letter from Minister Brun stated
that "Captain Christmas had no author
ization whatever to enter into I negotia
tions In the name of the Danish Gov
ernment, nor to' make any promises in
the name of the Government in connec
tion therewith."
Brun also says he gave Captain Christ

refused his requests in this connection.

thought Hay should come before , the
committee and should produce any â¢ let

his presence was. desired.' The chairman
rather/ emphatically dissented from
Richardson's suggestion that a3 the Sec
retary "had used this man," there
should be a more . detailed explanation
of any communications sent to him. No
arrangements were made for Hay ap
pearing, but it was understood he would
be heard later. ' Â¦Â¦ , Â¦
Seligman, of the firm of 'Seligman &

the firm to take charge" of money trans
ferred in case of a cession of the islands.
The firm wrote a private banker at
Copenhagen, mentioned : by ' Christmas,
and the answer from the. institution 1 was
unsatisfactory, giving no confirmation of

I hare received your letter of iho 31st of

In the early part of December, 1839, Captain
Christmas called upon me at this department
and Informed me that through private and
1 ersonal sources in Copenhagen he had become
aware that there was ' a disposition antfor.g
some of the leading members of the Danish
Government to regard favorably an" overture
frcm the Government of the United States look
ing to the acquisition of the Danish -islands.
He said that he had been a naval officer and
spoke at some length in regard to the desirabil
ity of the island of St. John as a naval station
for the United States. â¢ At my ' suggestion he
conveyed what further technical information
he. had on this subject to Admiral Bradford ct
the Navy Department. Although he presented
no credentials whatever and expressly declared
that he had no official character, I thought his
story was of sufficient Interest to be worth
investigation. I tcld him I would send a con
fidential and trusted agent of this Government
to Copenhagen to ascertain unofficially the true
EtatÂ« of affairs and mentioned to him the name
of Henry White, first secretary of the em
bassy at London. Captain Christmas said he
would like to be in Copenhagen when Mr.
White arrived and bring him into communica
tion with the members Â¦ of the Government
whom he mentioned. I gave him a note of in
troduction to 3Ir. White and they met In Co
penhagen, where Captain Christmas had ar
ranged for an interview between Mr." "White
and a member of the . Danish Government.
Captain Christmas was not present at this in
terview and his connection with the matter
ceased entirely at that time. Â¦ He afterward
returned to Washington and I saw him once
or twice but told him that there was no need
for services cf any private person In any nego
tiation which might be taken up between the
two Governments in regard to the acquisition
of the islands. I inclose a copy of a letter
which I gave to the Danish Minister in Wash
ington at the time of the signing of the recent
treaty and also a copy of a letter which I
have received from the " Danish Minister, Mr.

Danish islajid question his never had a

C. W. Knox of Gleneld, Md., whose
name was mentioned In the Christmas
report, told of meeting Christmas, whom
he considered a cultivated man ' who had
become entangled with sharpers. The
witness said he consented .to assist
Christmas, and a contract was submitted
t6 the committee by the terms of which
Knox was to aseist in a proper manner
to bring about the transfer. Knox

jiad been referred to, Knox said he gave
Christmas his check for $5, which \va3

the <;heck. This was the only financial
transaction in the entire affair. The
witness said he never bribed any one and
nothing of the kind was ever contem
plated; he never received any meney

In response to questions from members
of the committee Knox specifically de
nied that he had introduced Christmas
to W. J. Bryan, or that he had claimed
to Christmas that he was an .intimate
friend of Senator Hanna.

casual conversations with Christmas. As

brought by the State of Minnesota, says:
Minnesota Case Is Quoted.
The bill asks for a general order of re
straint and injunction and is a general
recital of the acts of merger which It is
claimed are in contravention of the laws
of the State of Washington prohibiting:
the consolidation of competing lines â¢ of
railroads. It is charged specifically that
the Northern Securities Company was
organized solely for the purpose of carry
ing out and accepting the designs, agree
ment and plans of James J. Hill and
J P. Morgan and their associate stock
holders to effect a consolidation of the
property, railway lines, corporate powera
and franchises of the Northern Pacific
and the Great Northern companies re
spectively through the Northern Securi
ties Company.
This combination is characterized as a
"conspiracy" and it Is asserted that the
interests of the individual stockholders In
the property, aid franchise of the two
railway companies was to terminate and
to be converted into an interes t In- the

Northern Securities Company, is not only
exercising the right of ownership of such
stock, but al3O dictating the management
of said railway companies.
The interest of the State in maintain
ing Independent lines of road Is fully set
forth, and in the accompanying brief the
legal reasons in support of the action
are set out in detail. Among these is the
plea that unless the Supreme Court as

to file his bill of complaint, Stratton sub

which the court refused to enter the bill

PAINE'S
Celery Compound
Reaches the Root of Every Fe-
male Trouble and Makes
Ouf .Women Strong
and Vigorous.
It is almost regrettable fact, and a
calamity, too, that our women, young
and old. are numbered amongst the most
unhealthy of females In the civilized
world. For delicacy of beauty, Intel-
lectual capacity, and for all graces that
adorn the sex they stand peerless; but
it is doubtful if one in ten can be found
who is functionally and organically well.
This absence of feminine .health an.I
vigorous vitality is due to a neglect of
nature's unerring laws. Immedlato
reformation is necessary if our nation
would have women who will become
true wives and mothers with an off-
spring that will prove a strength to the
country- . , .
For the special weaknesses to which
women are now victims, Paine's Celery
Compound is the surest and safest rem-
edy. The wonderful strengthening an-1
building-up properties of this marvelous
prescription devised by that eminent
medical expert. Prof. Edward E. Phelps.
M D LL. D-, and its specific action ia
correcting disorders of the female organ-
ism, are well known to the medical pro-
fession and to the tens of thousands of
women who have been raised from weak-
ness and disease to health and physical
h^aine e 's 3 Celery Compound quickly gives
the true health tint to sallow and blood-
less faces; it gives life and light to the
eyes; it gives pure, clean blood to course
through the body; it gives natttral appe-
tite, sweet- sleep, and that blessed cheer-
fulness that is the delight of men. Try
a bottle or two of Paine's Celery Com-
pound, dear suffering and run down sis-
ter Your condition, your family inter-
ests, and the welfare of society demand
this effort on your part.

being non-residents of the State of New Tork)

tion 1730 of the New Tork Code of Civil Pro-
cedure.
Two briefs were filed in opposition to
the prayer of the complainant, one ot
these being by George B. Young. M. T>.
Grover and C. W. Bunn, and the other
by former Attorney General John VV.
Griggs. Griggs takes' the position that
the bill of complaint does not present a
case of a controversy of a civil nature,
which, under the constitution and laws
of the United States, is justifiable in this
court, that it is a suit to enforce the
local law and policy of a State, whoso
right to make laws and enforce them ex-
ists only .within itself and by means of
its own agencies and is limited to Its own
territory, and that whatever the law of
the State of Washington is upon the
subject of the consolidation pf railroad
corporations, it is a municipal . or police
law, and not one conferring rights of, a
prcprietory or contractual nature. ,
HÂ« contends that. neither the courts of
the United , States nor or. Â»ajâ wther -jurist
diction outside the State j of Washington
will lend. their aid- to the enforcement of
the police laws of "Washington.
Denies the Suggestion, of . Injury.
He further points out that none of the
acts complained of is alleged to have
been done within the jurisdiction of the
State of Washington and says:
Every specific thins charged in the bill of
complaint as having been .done by the Northern,
Securities Company and its stockholders, and
by the stockholders of the two railway com-
panies, was in the exercise of a usual, univer-
sally conceded right In and over personal prop-
erty â the rizht to buy, sell, hold and vote
stock and to pay and receive dividends thereon.
The suggested injury that is feared is admitted
to spring from the fact that one person, or a
number of persons who are of one purpose, hold
a majority or controlling interest In the stock
of two competing lines of rail-way â a thine not
forbidden by the law of Washington or any
other State. It 13 certainly an astonishing
proposition that Washington has a right to
complain that a foreign corporation has ac-
quired a majority of the capital stock of two)
railway companies, one a Wisconsin corpora* -
tion and the other a Minnesoata company,
merely because the railroad companies operator
roads in Washington.
Griggs also makes the assertion that,
as a matter of fact, none of defendants
has combined or made any contract for
any of the purposes charged. * - ,
Quoting the laws of Washington bearing
on this point, he says: y
Nothing In any of these sections forbids one
person, whether an individual or a corporation,
from acquiring a majority of the stock in two
competing railroad companies. The prohibi-
tion is placed upon the companies themselves.
It is their acts, done for the purpose of con-
solidation and combination which are regulated,
not the acts of the- Individual stockholders In
selling their stock, or transferring It to ona
person or a syndicate of persons for the pur-
pose of control. - â¢ .

the expedition. He expects $75,000 to be
voted by the Dominion Government. The
steamer, which will be built here, to start
in December at the latest, will cost $60,000.
A system of wireless telegraphy is one
of the principal features of the* plan to
reach the pole, where Bernier expects to
be in 1906 at the latest. A wireless ap
paratus will be taken on the steamer.
After a voyage of two years, it is ex
pected, the vessel will be within 500 miles
of tbe pole. One party of adventurers
will then start over the ice further north,
planting posta, from which wireless mes
sages may be transmitted. Another party
will proceed further and finally it is ex
pected that a chain of wireless telegraphs
will be continued from the ship to the lo
cation of the pole. '

AMSTERDAM, April 7.â The Boer Bu

was sent last January by General De
larey> to Kruger, and which is counter
signed by Ignatius Ferraria, the acting

Th's report contains numerous stories
of alleged British ! atrocities and is sup
ported by affidavits. Besides the general
accusations of placing women as screens
around the British camps, as a result of
which practice many women are said to
have been 1 killed. General Delarey gives
speciV instances, with names and dates,
of the killing of wounded prisoners and
women. He complains that, owing to
Lord Methuen's persecution, his own
wife, with six children, has been wan
dering on the veldt for the past year.
General Delarey complains also that his
mother, aged 83 years, was driven into
Klerksdorp, after her cattle had been
stolen and her house burned.

The contest was actively waged and the
count was watched with the utmost in
terest. After the votes had been counted
Luther Brown, who was watching the in
terests of the Gage adherents, mounted a
chair and made an address, asking for
harmony in the party no matter which
candidate won.
The contest was a clean-cut struggle
between the forces of Governor Gage and
Senator Flint. For a long time the men in
control of the Union League have been
strong In their opposition to the renom
lnation of Governor Gage, and : Senator
Flint while on hi3 trips to Los Angeles
has been the recipient of many courtesies
from the dominant element. So strong
have the Flint forces felt themselves in
the club that the assertion was recently
made by one of the leaders 1 that "90 per
cent of the Union League is for. Flint.**
Realizing the far-reaching effect a defeat
in the leading Republican club of his
home city would have, the supporters of
Gage made extraordinary efforts to carry
the election, but without avail. Flint's
majority was in the ratio of about four
to three.

railways, either the Gould system, the
Union Pacific or the Santa Fe.
LOS ANGELES, April 7.â Dispatches
from Denver report that the Colorado
Southern has been purchased jointly by

President Rlpley nor President Harriman
has thus far evinced a disposition to ac
quire the new Huntington-Crocker-Haw

Several Changes Are Hade in the
OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE r
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
The general had not concluded his
statement when the committee ad
journed until 10:30 to-morrow morning.
Major General Arthur MacArthur be
gan his statement, which he said would
be a review of his observations in the
islands and of opinions he had formed.
He said that after a complete study of
the situation he had concluded that per
manent American occupation of the
islands was advisable.
In the course of the brief debate Sena
tor Culberson charged Governor Taft
with deliberately withholding the report
damaging to the army while testifying
before the committee, -and he . then said
tnat l!ic vfTtnnoldingr of this report on the
part of the Secretary of War was done
as a purpose of controlling a committee
of the Senate. '
The incident finally closed when, the
committee adopted a resolution calling
for the report and General Chaffee's com
ment thereon.
This, however, did not satisfy Senator
Culberson, and he moved that the Sec
retary of War be directed to furnish the
committee with a copy of the report In
question.
The Secretary further said that this re
port had been Eent to General Chaffee
to investigate, and that he had been or
dered to make a full report thereon.
In answer to Senator Culberson Sen
ator Lodge, chairman of the committee,
explained that this report had been de
tained by the War Department because
it contained criticisms upon the army,
ar.d on the army in that province In par
ticular. The object of thus keeping back
the report was to first have . comment
upon It by General Chaffee.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
"W., WASHINGTON, April 7.â As an In
dication that the Democrats in Congress
Intend to take up the case of General
Miles against the administration. Sena
tor Culberson to-day In the Senate Com
mittee on the Philippines called atten
tion to the fact that Governor Taft and
the Secretary of War Had withheld an
Important report from the province of
Layabas. The Senator further charged
that they had done so for a purpose.
The report in question was that upon
which General Miles, in the correspond
ence laid by the President before the
House, charged that "warfare In the
Philippine Islands had been conducted
With marked severity."
General Miles continued In his letter:
"It is proper to say that I had in mind
such information as is conveyed in a let
ter of Governor William Taft. addressed
to the honorable Secretary, dated Wash
ington, February 7. 1902. as well as other
communications that have been referred
to headquarters or received by me."
In reply to this Secretary Root replied
to General Miles as follows: "Reference
in the memorandum to the letter of Gov
ernor Taft to the Secretary of War, dated
February 7. 1902, is to a letter transmit
ting, for the purpose of an investigation
by the military authorities, a report by
the civil Governor of the province of Lay
abas containing in general terms and
without specifications of names, serious
charges against the military administra
tion in that province and against the
army generally in Its relation to civil
government."

a Report.
Much time was consumed by tlffe Sen
ate to-day in the discussion of ! the con
ference report on the bill to reduce war
revenue taxes. As passed by the Senate
the tax on transactions In so-called
bucket shops was retained. The con
ferees struck out that provision, it be
ins explained that the house would not
consent to its enaction. Berry of Ar
kansas, Bacon of Georgia and Pettus of
Alabama insisted that ibe Senate should
demand the retention of the tax. Aid
rich of lthode Island, Allison of Iowa
and Spooner of Wisconsin, while they,
were in favor of the tax, explained that
it couid not be retained without en-,
dangering the entire measure. The con
ference report finally was adopted, at!
to 20.
The conference report on the war rev
enue tax repeal bill was adopted by the
House and the bill sent to the White
House.
Payne, â¢ the majority leader, called up
the conference report.
Richardson, the Democratic member
of the House conferees, explained . why
he declined to sign . the report. He said
the Democrats did not believe that all
the war revenue taxes should be re
pealed and taxes on the necessaries of
life remain. For instance, 4ie said, he
favored the Senate amendment which
would have allowed the tax on bucket
shops to remain, but which the confer
ence dlsasreed to. '
Payne in reply said he had opposed the
Senate amendment because he did not
believe in taxing the small gamblers and
allowing the big ones to go Scot free.
â¢â¢Besides," raid he, "we promised the
people that we would Â¦ remove every
vestige of the war taxes, and we want
to keep our promise."
The report, was adopted without di
vision. . â¢- v-V, . ' .
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The con
ferees on the vat" revenue repeal bill to
day reported an agreement, the Senate
receding from its amendment which <e
tains the tax on "bucket shops." It was
stated that taken in consideration with
repealed sections of the law, it was doubt
ful whether the Senate provision would
stand and also that it was quite likely
that the provisions would permit mem
bers of stock exchanges engaging in the
business which the amendment would
prevent among . so-called bucket n shop

FOR the peculiar and distlnguishiiig
grace of E. S. Willard, Louis N.
Parker's â¢ new - play, "The Car
dinal," presented for the first
time la*t night at the Columbia
Theater, offers grateful opportunity.
There is no more graceful actor on the
contemporary stage than Mr. '.Willard, ]
none to whom conies more easily the
portrayal of the "grand manner," the air
of courts, and in Mr. Parker'B Cardinal
Medici, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent,
the actor has a role that fits him Hke a,
glove. The character is very pleasantly
sketched fn the first act. One of the lit
erati of the splendid Medicean period, sl
lover of art and high prince of the
church, Giovanni Medici appears first in
his Roman palace *as the connoisseur, tilt-
Ing good-naturedly with another .devotee
of the beautifuL,and as the kind son and
good brother of the younger Medici. In
the next act, compelled' to hear a confes
sion of murder by . an outlawed Floren
tine, a tool of Pope Julius, he is all the
priest, dignified and reverend. Later, his
brother accused of the murder of which
the Cardinal's confespional knowledge has
made him cognizant, he is thÂ« magnificent
Medici, full of the pride of place, minded
Â¦vrith grief at the sorrow that has befallen
his house.
recount his victories to the Cardinal. He
has not heard of the . younger Â¦ Medici's
arre&t for his crime, which happens to
be the murder of the father of the girl
with whom both Strozzi and the younger
Medici are in love. Strozzi boasts
of the good luck the Cardinal's
absolution has brought to him, then
the Cardinal tells him of Giuliano
Medici's arrest. Strozzi, a kind of Italian
highbinder, is sorry for the affair, and,
in response to the Cardinal's representa
tion that a confession now, in the height
of his favor in Rome, will only add to
Strozzi's fame, the murderer promises to
confess. He is on the point of leaving
when Giuliano's betrothed enters the
room, and thenâ it is a question that if
the girl will marry him he will save her
lover. In a splendid speech the Cardinal
forbids the girl's offered sacrifice, and
in the next act feigns madness and .wrings
a confession. from the murderer. It will
be seen that the play is novel, and the
plot, though with a somewhat- machine
made manner, is yet well enough con
structed. ' It is not always convincing-,
and frequently "talky," but is well worth
seeing. . . >
With a very little more warmth . and
abandon Mr. Willard could make a much
more impressive figure of the Cardinal.
The portrait Is somewhat wanting in red
blood, in bones under the flesh, the very
finish of Mr. Willard's manner perceptibly
detracting in the high lights from its
strength. But it is very little, and
what is given is so much, an elegance of
diction, case and grace of gesture and
wide and, sweet intelligence of conception
that are most grateful, together with a
personality than which none on the stage
is more engaging.

A like meed of praise must be bestowed
upon the presentation of the leading roles
. in the drama. Miss Stone is â¢ up to her
reputation- in Gismonda, and emphasizes
: with- true art the telling ; points, that only
such as Sardou can furnish. In the
strong passagesâ her indignant denuncia
tion of the suggestion that Almerio should
be got rid 'â¢ of . by stealthy assassination,
and her oath at the cross, when her little
son is in. danger of being torn to pieces
by the tiger â she shows the mettle of the
true actress. Melbourne . MacDowell,
manly, handsome and the finished artist
' that! he is, fills the role of Almerio with
his wonted fire and. finish. The audience

At the first public display of the regi

there congratulated by. his Grace upon
the showing made. The exertions of com

then suffered, soon laid him low, and he
â¢finally answered the "last call."
The staff and line officers determined
to . perpetuate his | name in the regiment,

: President.
Overwork and Worry Over
Financial Affairs Prompt
"the Deed. '.
KANSAS CITT, April 7.â James "Whit
field, president of the "Western Baseball
League and for many years sporting ed
itor of the Kansas City Star, committed
suicide at his home here early to-day. He
arose and dressed himself and then, with
out making any remark, stepped to the
next room and fired a bullet into his right
temple. He was dead, when members of
his family reached him.
Whitfleld's suicide i3 laid to overwork
and worry over financial affairs. He had
lost heavily on several enterprises in
which he was Interested. "Whitfield was
born In England forty-seven years ago.
He had lived in St. Louis, Peorta and Pe
king 111., and was married in Peking. He
came to Kansas City in I8S4, and with the
exception of one year, when he was pro
prietor of the Referee, a- small weekly, he
had been with the Star. He was actively
engaged in baseball as early as the 80 s.
He was one of the organizers of' the orig
inal Western League and was 1.3 first
president. In 18S6 his presence at the Na
tional League meetings In New York and
Chicago and his pleas for Kansas City on
those occasions won for Kansas City its
first and only franchise in the big league.
Whitfleld was made secretary of the club.
The tornado In May of that year spoiled
the team's chances of making money oy
destroying the grand stand and flooding
the diamond. In 1888 Whittteld again act
ed as the association's representative,
and he was again successful in securing a
franchise for Kansas Ctty. That was hi3
last active appearance in baseball mat
ters until he was elected president of the
"Western League at St. Joseph last win-
Since he decided to head the league that
Is fighting the American Association
Whitfleld has Wiled night and day. Re
cently the tax upon him began to tell,
and for the last two week3 he has been
under a physician's care. On March 28 he
returned from his last trip in behalf of
the league from Peorla and was -com
pelled to take to his bed.
Last week at the great American handi
cap shoot- Whitfield by sheer force of will
attended the six days' contest. Saturday
last found him on the verge of nervous
prostration, and on Sunday he was out of
his head part of the time. [ Nothing se
rious was thought. of hi3 case, however.
It is not known here what effect,' if any,
Whitfleld's death will have upon the
Western League. Manning and Nichols,
owners of the Kansas City club, are out
of the city, Manning being in the East
and Nichols in St. Louis. -
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., April. 7.â Owner W.
T. Van Brunt of the "Western League
baseball team here to-day said that there
had been no trouble bet-ween members of
the league and President "Whltfleld. At
the last league meeting, when the schedule
was made up, "Whitfield was not- expected
to be present, as he was very bnsy. Van
Brunt said Vice President Thomas Burns
of. Colorado Springs will succeed to the
presidency of the league for the- present,
and later the place will be offered to M.
H. Saxton, president of the three leagues.

In rendering his decision this afternoon.
Judge Anpellot ti said that the case was a
peculiar one. The Legislature had never
seen fit to vest in a Superior Judge the
jxnwr the complainant seeked to invoke;
neither had such a point ever before been
brought up In the Supreme Court for
final action. He believed, however, * that
the County Clerk must receive all regis
trations if made out in proper form and
that it devolved upon the Election Board
to x>ennit or prevent the voting of those
registered.

"If he doesn't come down to-night,"
said Cane, "we'll give him the slip for
good. In two weeks he will haye copied
down. Then we'll go back and ask his
blessing."
Papa -King, no letter from his
daughter in Alturas became suspicious
and for two weeks he has been sending
inquiries everywhere. The. lovers were
safe until the delegates from'. Lakeview to
the Republican convention in Portland
last week stumbled across them. Then
the word was wired to King. A friend
warned Cane and he and his ' bride fled
to Redding. Cane's friend telegraphed to
this city that the old gentleman was
traveling at high speed to Portland. To
night the lovers started for San Fran
cisco. Â¦ " â¢ , '
But love found a way. A month ago
Cane mounted his horse and went north
to Portland. A .week later Miss King's
father . let her go to Alturas to visit
friends, hoping the change: would cause
her to forget Cane. Of course tie young
lady doubled on her tracks, and after a
roundabout journey on horseback and
stages she reached Portland, was met by
her lover and on last Friday they were
married. Cane says his wife is 23 and
old enougrh to know her own business, i
Walter Cane and his. beautiful wife, who
was Miss Maud King : until she changed
her name in Portland on April 4, arrived
from the north. When accused of an
elopement Cane at- flrsc denied it, but
nnally told the whole truth. He is a
pleasant young man and he has a ranch
and cattle range 700 miles north of Lake
view, in the Oregon woods, near Prin
ville. Last Christmas he went to Lake
view to buy sheep and there he met win
some Maud King, whose lather, William
King, has a large ranch forty miles from
Lakeview. They fell in love at sight and
exchanged promises to marry. Then
Father King heard about it and there was
a storm. His wife is dead and his daugh
ter was his Idol. He vowed that she
should never marry Walter Cane.

mains were taken yesterday from the

-Â¦vorshipful master of the local lodge and
a member of the undertaking firm of
Barton & Catick, and laid to rest In the
city cemetery. The Masons attended the
services in a body.
Blair, being a Mason, returned to this

Phoenix Lodge. The lodge appropriated
$45 to have the bones brought to this city
and Blair again made the trip to the des
ert. The bones were gathered together
find brought here, where they were placed
in a casket.
It was more than seven years ago that
"Jack" Blair, one of the best-known
:nining men and prospectors in Southern
California, started on a journey across
Mojave desert. When a short distance
east of Cottonwood Springs he saw the
bones of a human being lying near the
ride of the road. He paid no attention
to the skeleton at the time, but on his
return trip his attention was attracted by
something bright lying near the remains
of the unfortunate wanderer. Blair
picked up the object- and It proved to be
a Masonic pin. Papers found near showed
the body to be that of George Strauben
miller.
SAX BERNARDINO. April 7.â Seven

From the summary that has been published, it ap
pears the Tours . Congress demands the abolition of
all tariff duties and' the adoption of -lull freedom of
trade, calls for a graduated income tax, the enforce-,

tion of labor to eight hours a'day, a State insurance
"system, full freedom of education of all grades, the
prohibition of private schools, the enactment oU laws
forbidding % the employment of. women for night work,
at any trade, the abolition of the Presidency and the
Senate so as to give the Deputies complete control of
the Government, the .election of Judges by direct vote
of the people, universal suffrage for both sexes, the
abolition of compulsory military service, the con
struction by the Government of proper homes for the
poor, and the nationalization of mines.
Some of these demands are not beyond the pro

The issue is one of considerable importance just*
now, for it signifies the complete eclipse of Bryam'sm,
and perhaps the permanent elimination of that 'phase
of partisanship from 1 our politics. The Call recently
directed attention to the vote' in ; the Mississippi Leg
islature declaring for an alliance of Southern Democ
racy with New \York and utterly repudiating the
Chicago platform and the Populistic Democracy of
the West That in itself was a significant .demon-'
stration of the change in Southern sentiment, but an
even more notable manifestation of change is found
in the recent statement that among 'all â¢ the Senators
from the JSouth at Washington only! two are out and
put Bryan men. Those two are Tillman and Jones
of Arkansas. .Tillman is discredited in his own State
and Jones is soon to lose his Senatorship, for the
recent' vote in the Democratic primaries in Arkansas
shows that *his party is opposed to his â¢re-election;,'.
Such" being the drift- of opinion ; in the South,' it is *
clear the time has .come for Bryan to decide whether
he will retire from politics or ' be: ; retired Tby the
Southern and Eastern combination! If he wishes to
avoid both; evils it is Â¦ high ; time he took the stump. "'
Something' is doing in the South, arid if he do not
head it ,off it will have a "get there" movement on it

The truth of Clay's statement of fact is indis
putable. The South does furnish the strength of the
Democratic .party. Without the 'delegations from
that section of the Union there would hardly be
enough Democrats in Congress to form a commit
tee. Nor docs it appear that any valid objection. can
be made to the conclusion the Senator drew from
the fact. ' Since the . South does the main part of the
Democratic voting, why should she not draw , up the
platforms and nominate the candidates she expects
to vote for? . Â¦ .
SENATOR CLAY of Georgia recently closed a
discussion of. the conflict between the â¢Bryanite
Democrats of. the West and the Gold Demo
crats of the East, by saying that as. the South fur
nishes the strength of the Democratic party it should
have the right to decide upon party policies. That
viewis shared by a good many other Southern men,
and it is probable that the fight between Nebraska
and New York will be settled urthe next national
convention by the arbitrariness if riot the arbitration
of the solid South. -. -

self-government is at stake in everything that re
lates to the regulation of public utilities. The elec
tion of Gage is not absolutely necessary to the
schemers provided they can carry the amendment,
for he can appoint their Commissioners before he
goes out of office ; but his defeat ( and that of the
amendment also are necessary to the welfare of the
State. ";;Â¦ ' . Â¦ : '-l^i- Â¦ Â¦ Â¦. Â¦
Such is the issue and such are the foes that con
front the rank and file of the Republican party. The
combination is formidable. Back of Gage is Herrin
and the bosses of both parties, and back ofTthe
bosses, are the allied corporations working for the
adoption of amendment No. 28. It is a big scheme
and the menace to California is enormous. It will
not do for the people to underrate the danger. Local
It is the duty of the press to point out to the peo
ple this phase of the situation. The fight now going
on to capture the Republican State convention is not
being waged in the interest of such a petty politi
cian as Gage, nor is it mainly for the bosses and the
henchmen who are most conspicuous in making it.
It is a fight made by powerful corporations for a
scheme that will open the way for imposing rates
equal to all the traffic will bear upon every sort of
public utility in .California. In this fight Democratic
as well as Republican bosses are enlisted. Billy
Herrin is'not doing politics solely in the Republican
camp, and the tone of the yellow organ of Democ
racy shows that he is getting help in the Democratic
camp as well as from Kelly, Cnmmins, Burns,
Burke and Lynch, who pose as Republicans.
It is to be borne in mind that the commission in
the first instance is to be appointed by the Gov
ernor, and there will be no election to the office by
the people except as the terms of those appointed by
the Governor expire. There are to be five Commis
sioners; one is to hold for two years, another for
four years, a third for six years, a fourth for eight
years and the fifth for ten years. Thus the men to
be appointed by Gage should the amendment be
adopted would control the commission for six years
to come. Is it any wonder the railway and other
corporation bosses arc backing* him?
It will be apparent to every intelligent man. that if
the amendment be adopted the corporations will
have only to get control of the commission to have
the people at their mercy. .With that commission
on their side they can afford to defy any and every
effort to obtain reasonable rates. Even such strictly
local questions as those affecting the water supply
of communities will be decided by the commission
and not by the local authorities. What more, then,
could the most grasping corporation wish than the
establishment of such a commission during the Gov
ernorship of a man who will appoint such Commis
sioners as the corporations desire? -
Assembly constitutional amendment No. 28 is the
boldest effort to establish boss corporation rule in
California -Ihat. has. ever ..been .attemptetL /The
amendment annuls sections 22 and 23 of article XII
of the constitution, relating to corporation's, and
creates a commission to be composed of five mem
bers, clothed with extraordinary powers. It is to
have supervision over railway, telegraph, telephone,
water,, light, power, sleeping-car, express and "other
corporations." AH authority now vested in State
commissions,' Boards of Supervisors, Common
Councils or other bodies to supervise # and regulate
rates of public utilities is taken away. The proposed
new commission is to have control of the whole.
AS the State campaign progresses it becomes
more and more evident that the real scheme
of the corporation bosses is not so much the
re-election of Gage as that of procuring the adop
tion of Assembly constitutional amendment No. 28.
Gage is necessary to the. scheme, of course, for
should -the amendment be adopted he .would have
the appointment of the commission for which it pro
vides. Whether he be defeated or elected is a minor
matter. He is in office now and the appointments
would be in his hands. The corporations must
t>tand by him. For once the tool is in a position to
boss the bosses.

PERSONAL.
It remains to be seen: how far Hanna will permit
his zeal on behalf of Rathbone to carry him! into an
tagonism to the President. In the fight as it stands'
public ; sentiment will be against him. ;- Rathbone has
been tried- and duly convicted by a court of compe
tent jurisdiction and apparently on fair evidence of
having robbed the Cuban postoffice.' The firmness
of the President, in refusing to interfere with the
course of the law is commendable, and it would seem
that Hanna could hardly", afford to make a fight
against the President: on such 1 , ground as he has
taken. Stjll 'there is^. unquestionably â¢ a. 'strong, ele
ment in the" East that is trying to^ force Hinnavinto
opposition to-the admiriistratiori7 andiihto a contest
with Roosevelt for the 'nomination in 1904, and it is
by no means impossible that the; feeling growing out
of the Rathbone case may precipitate an open con
flict between the two. Should it prove so, 4he poli
tics of this country is going to be much livelier than
it has been since Me Kinley's first Presidency. .
U Hanna's argument is that; Rathbone did not have
a fair trial in Havana ? and should be brought to .the
United States arid given a trial in an' American court
under American law. ; He. ha? been urging'tKe Presi
dent to procure a new trial for Rathbone or to par
don him, but the President has refused. ' In fact, ; it
appears the..request niade ; by the- Senator 1 is decidedly
irregular. . A Washington dispatch!*says:" "It is -re-'
garded \ here a's doubtful Â¦ whether the President, has
the. right to setVaside'^the- judgment of "the 'Cuban
court,- for Cuba is. a foreign country,' although "under
the nominal protection' of the United , States. The
same reasoning makes it extremely improbable i that
Congress would enact' a law transferring the accused
ex-officials to this country." Â¦
Such doubts as may haunt the minds of other
people in Washington evidently do not trouble the
mind of the Senator from Ohio, for he has been in
sistent on the part v bf his friend ever since his con
viction. He has helped Rathbone to give the bail
of $100,000 required by the Cuban court, and is now
arranging to obtain for him a new trial in that coun
try if he cannot obtain A it in the United States.- - '
MAJOR .RATHBONE'Scase is becoming ir^
teresting from' a political' '.Â¦; point -.^ of, -view.
. :The earnestness with! which -Senator Hanna is
reported to.. be j defending him, and the reported firm
ness of the President to take no part in assisting the
Senator in the work, give anew occasion for specu-.
lation concerning a possible rivalry and antagonism
beween.the two. Rathbone himself is (no very' great
figure/, but if he should be' the cause of a political
fight j between two such champions as Roosevelt and
Hanna, he would have a marked influence on the his
tory of the Republican party' for th*e coming ; three
years' and might be a factor in determining the next 'Â¦

What, we ask, what indeed, can more rapidly,
economically and satisfactiyely placate those people
and convince them of our superiority over Spain
than honoring the memory of- Rizal and keeping
Private Davis busy?
Another reflection, which burnishes our pride till
it shines like new brass, is that we have so much
improved on the methods of Spain. Dr. Rizal or
ganized the revolution of 1896 for independence. We
looked on at a distance and immediately observed
that the natives who joined him were good, and -de
sired independence with a great longing which
caused them to fight and die for it. But medieval
and mistaken Spain immediately began to shoot
prisoners who were good. They induced Rizal to
surrender under promise of safe conduct and peiv
mission to expatriate himself. As soon as he was in
their power they took their prisoner out in the plaza
at. Cavite and shot him! Remember, now, that he
had not even refused as a prisoner to' divide his
roots and herbs with his captors. He had shown
none of the stigmata of : degenerate badness which
Davis detects so easily. We have a school superin
tendent in Manila who on Rizal's birthday caused
Jus memory to be formally honored in all the
schools we have established in the islands.
Now Private Davis-seems to be the man for whom
we have been looking. Among the eighty, tribes, in*
the archipelago are all sorts and conditions. Some
wear clothes and some don't. Their variety is in
finite and we are after the bad ones, but with a lim
ited and finite capacity to distinguish them from the^
good. Under .these painful circumstances it no
doubt happens that we are retarding the placation of
the islands and indisposing the people toward our
spelling-book and institutions by mistakenly shoot
ing prisoners who belong to . the good class. They
are naturally regarded as -martyrs, and their fate im
pairs the spread of our gentle and humanizing in
fluence. In this situation Private Davis ceases to be
a private. He is a boon. He is more valuable/than
a commission, greater than an army with banners.
He can tell bad natives at a glance and unerringly
select them for execution. He should be kept in
action, being careful rot to fatigue him, since such a
gift, fagged by overwork, may depart and return us
to our first estate. He is lifting the clouds as fast as
he can, and should not be crowded. His methods
institute a much needed economy. All that is needed
is Davis and a firing squad. The ' good natives,
highly appreciative of this discrimination, can be
trusted to bury the dead bad ones, and hold a fiesta
over their timely removal, for^they were. stumbling- .
blocks in the path, of progress, up ' which we are tri
umphantly treading " arid taking the good natives
along-.. : ..-;,.;- â¢â¢.Â¦;Â¦.; .....*' ...;-.- . -.'.,Â¦.: *â¢â¢Â¦-';
On Major Waller's trial there is much -testimpny
to the general treachery of the natives, and a
Macabebe scout has sworn that he has no doubt
these prisoners would have escaped by killing their j
captors if they could. In the face of this conclusive '
vindication of Major Waller our vote is ior his ac
quittal and promotion. But there is one revelation .
incident to his trial upon which we desire 4 to hang a
comment or two. It appears that in his force there .
is a private named Davis who has the power of life ]
and death. The major's witness testified that Davis
had this absolute power and picked out everywhere.,
the bad natives from' the good, and they were shot
in accordance with his selection. j
Major Waller pleads guilty of ordering the prison
ers shot, but submits evidence to establish his,right
to do so. Some of this is general in its nature, to
the effect that many Filipinos are bad people any-
way, useful principally for targets. It is also in evi-^
dence that the prisoners deserved death because in
the trying march from their homes to their graves
their captors ( had nothing to feed' them, and they
were guilty of saving themselves from death by star
vation by eating roots and leaves, which they did
pot divide with Major Waller and. his soldiers. It;
being a. well "settled article of war that a military
prisoner must share his roots and herbs with his
captors, .under penalty of death, there' will be no
question of the propriety of shooting, these prisoners.
THE developments in', the trial of Major Wal
ler for shooting eleven Filipino prisoners may
well be studied by those who are students of
the various methods of placating that hostile people.
The prisoners who were shot were captured and car
ried a waj' from their village and families by' Major
Waller and his men,^and on arrival at his destination
were by him ordered shot. There are some'imma
terial details in the affair. It is said that the prison
ers were tied up and shot first in the arms and legs
before any, vital part was aimed at to complete the
execution. But war is a killing trade, and those who,
follow it must have practice, so we pass over this.

BENICIA. April 7.â During the storm
last night the steamer Zealandia, which
was used as a Government transport, but
for several months past has been an
chored In the strait between this city and
Martinez, dragged her anchor and drifted
against the wharf at the Agricultural
Works, where she ran aground. 'Ehe crew
got up steam, and, with .the aid of the
high tide this morning, succeeded In get
ting loose and made safely out Into the
channel again. - -
Gale Carries Zealandia Ashore.
The sloop' Fleetwlng, which only a few
hours previously had passed from the pos
session of its old-time owner, George Per
rls, into that of William E. Lingard,
broke away, owing to a defective oak
anchor stock. She drifted against "W. Ol
sen's sloop Maggie L, smashing her own
bowsprit and the Maggie I/s main boom
and bowsprit. . Both boats sustained other
damage. The big sloop Freda' went adrift
and smashed the bowsprit of . the sloop
Discovery, besides severely straining her
own by coming right on top of the Dis
covery's cabin. John v Norby was kept
rowing to and fro In the dark night and
driving storm, putting anchors out to hold
the boats. In this work he was ably â¢as
sisted by George Perrls.
i Alex J. 'Young's big sloop Clara dragged
her moorings, but luckily fetched up -Just
before colliding with the Corinthian boat
house. W.-C Corbett's sloop Mist broke
away and was carried by the waves high
up. on the Tlburon beach. Her ballast
was luckily out of her and -she did her
self lit tie or no damage. The ark Cas
pian got adrift, but fortunately was
brought up before she had done any harm
to herself or any of the yachts. The
storm did more damage to the Corinthian
fleet than any that has occurred for some
years. Some Idea of the force of the
wind may be gathered from the fact that
an old salt like George Perris was not
successful in rowing around the point on
which the boathouse Is built until his
third attempt. * "Â¦"-.. Â¦ v
Over at Sausallto the cutter Folly broke
away and drifted in a northerly direction,
but luckily clearing the ferry, slip, went
into Richardson Bay. The sloop Occident
of the California Yacht Club, which car
ried away her Jibstay on Sunday after
noon,-was yesterday towed to her moor
ings in Oakland Creek by the launch C. A.
McNeil. The little sloop Amy of the same
club did not get back to her anchorage
near the clubhouse till about 7:30 yester
day morning. The California sloop Hope
had not returned to her moorings yester
day morning, having run for shelter on
Sunday afternoon, and spent the night In
a sheltered spot.
Boatkeeper John Norby says he spent
the most strenuous period of his career as
steward of the Corinthian Yacht Club oh
Sunday night and during the early hours
of yesterday morning. The southwesterly
storm', which lulled somewhat during the
early, part of .Sunday, evening, broke out
with .renewed violence .between 9 and 10
o'clock and for several hours there was
something; doing In TlDuron Cove. The
sloop Genesta broke away from her moor
ings and ran almost on the beach near
McDonough's saloon. The schooner
Bonita, which had got loose and been
made fast early in the day, broke away
again, and ' drifting against the Japanese
laundry j . near the drawbridge. ' carried
away the steps and created a great com
motion among: the Oriental . washermen.

tlve Hay of Virginia, chairman o/ the
Democratic House caucus, to-day. Issued
a call for a conference of Democratic
members on the subject of Cuban re
ciprocity at 8 o'clock to-morrow night.
The call followed a petition, sigrned by
more than twenty-five Democratic mem
bers requesting the conference. The
move caused some agitation on both
sides of the chamber, in connection with
the opening of the debate on the Cuban
bill to-morrow, as it was thought to in
troduce a new element of doubt as to
the final vote on that measure. The~
movement for a conference was under
stood to have been initiated by those on
posed to the bill, with a view to con
centrating the minority in opposition. It
was conceded by the supporters of the
Payne bill that a combination between
the minority and the Republicans who
oppose reciprocity would make the final
issue doubtful.

TWO BRITISH VESSELS THAT

THE storm that raged Sunday night
and continued with considerable
violence until an" early hour yes
terday morning left comparative
ly little damage In its wake. The
British ship Drummuir lost her bowsprit
as the result of being fouled by the tramp
steamship Kirkdale, and the lighter used
to carry the big guns being installed on
the .fortifications at Point Bonita is still
ashore at Lime Point. The schooner San
Buena Ventura, which was lying at an
chor without a soul aboard, went adrift
during the night, fouled and carried away
both buoys marking the wreck of the May
Flint. Schooner and bouys brought up
near, the Alameda shore. The' gasoline
schooner Newark fouled the whistling

and was cleared with difficulty. . <

When the balloting had been completed
it was announced that Allison, Boot,
Sayre, White an^ Taylor had been elect
ed. Boot is a member of the present
board of directors. Sayre and White have
belonged to a former board. Of the re
maining two gentlemen, Allison, it may
be said, will undoubtedly succeed Kear
ney in the presidency.
When the meeting assembled in the
afternoon, it was announced that a num
ber of candidates for the directorship
had > withdrawn. Balloting then com
menced, and for a time the house was in
an uproar. The fight had by this time
virtually concentrated ,upon C. Gaines.

no part in the.. meeting,, and numbered
just sixty-two men.
Kearney Is Snowed Under.
A. storm arose as to whether or not
any more names should be added to the
list. Judge Fairweather of Reedley took
the stand and was greeted with cries of
\'sit down." But the Judge stayed with
it and put in a strong appeal for har
mony. It was anally decided to allow as
many names to be voted on as the grow
ers cared to nominate, and again the
name of M. Theodore Kearney was put
In nomination. This time Kearney
permitted his name to stay.
ML Theodore Kearney, P. G. Goode,
Hector Burness and George P. Bev
eriage were pjit up by the Kearney
ticket. As soon as tellers were elected
the growers started in a ' rush for the
balloting table. The chairman finally
succeeded In obtaining order and at last
put a motion that an adjournment be
taken until 1:30 o'clock this afternoon, to
auow the clerks to register the growers
present and the proxies.
"I desire to say that I cannot accept
a nomination on the platform of. the
committee of fifteen. If another plat
form be chosen embodying the plan of a
growers' packing association I am will
ing to work with you and fight it out on
those lines."
M. J. Lay mance of Oakland j presented
A Jist of twenty names of association
members nominated for the board of di
rectors. Immediately afterward a mo
tion was made . that . nominations- be
closed, but several nominations were
made before the motion could be put.
Among the names was that of President
Kearney, who immediately arose and
shouted above the babel:
Nominations for Directors.
At 10:45 o'clock this morning Armory
Hall "was filled when President Kearney
rapped for order. The president at first
expressed doubt as to there being a quo
rum, but | at last consented to raise no
question as to 'a" sufficient number being
present. The spirit of . the meeting
seemed decidedly anti-Kearney, and sev
eral â¢ times derisive cries , greeted the
president when he made a suggestion.
The most marked- demonstration 1 came
when Kearney arose to read his annual
address. He had barely started ..> when
some one arose and moved . that the ad
ores* be laid upon the table. Kearney
declared the motion out of order, but the
decision - was appealed from and the
president "was iinally forced to abandon
his address, with a majority, of- fully
four-ntths of the growers against him.
FRESNO, April 7.â The California Rai
sin Growers' Association met in this
city to-day, with an attendance of more
than 800 members, and elected directors
for the ensuing year. . The meeting was
a decided victory for the enemies of
President Kearney, . who ~ was "turned
down" on almost, every question- he
brought before the convention. .. ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The conference therefore adjourned and
the strike of. 10,000 miners goes on, with
no immediate prospect of settlement. The
district officers say that General Manager

- The Board of Works submitted a reso
lution recommending the .conditional'ac
ceptance of Mission street, from Silver
avenue to Onondaga avenue, and also the
paving of Mission street from Silver avo
nue to Ocean avenue, from funds avail
able therefor together with the further
sum of. $7500 donated by property owners.
Commissioner Casey filed a counter reso
lution that Mission street r be accepted
from Crescent avenue to the- county line.
The resolution recites that the street- is
in a deplorable condition and recommends
that the Board 'of Supervisors appropriate
sufficient money in the "next- budget to
pave the roadway for its entire - length.
An ordinance, however, was passed to
print ordering the acceptance of Mission
street from Silver avenue to Onondaga
avenue. . â¢/-'..;Â¦ : . '. -Â¦
D'Ancona admitted that the price asked
by the Bay View L>and Company was in

The ordinance authorizing the Mayor to
offer $8000 to the Bay View Land Com
pany for an eight-acre tract to be J - used
as a pesthouse site was also referred to
the same committee. Payot w and Wilson
opposed its passage on ' the ground that
the site was> not a proper one. Wilson
said it was inaccessible and it would cost
$5600 to build a . roadway, and. as there
was no water on the site, the cost would
be materially increased. Braunhart re
ferred to the fact that the Health Board
favored the Partridge site, but a number
of protestants had opposed the selection
of the site. Â¦
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
ceived another offer of a site for. a pest
house from -Mrs.' A. B. Deusslng, who
agrees to sell* to" the city ;twetve 'lots in
block 32 and block 29 in the tract of the

CONSIDERS SITE
FOR PESTHOUSE
Too many deaths and accidents are happen
ing in this city and the iÂ»'w should step in and
protect the people. An accurate count made on
March 17 shows that 535 teams Dassed Mont
gomery street going west on Market, street be
tween 5 and 0 p. ra. The lives of pedestrians
are endangered by the many vehicles which
could just as conveniently take Mission or
Howard street, where there Is less travel," and
thus remove the congestion . on the principal
street of the city. f, -
The Grand Jury sent a communication
advising that an ordinance be passed pro
viding that trucks and teams going west
be urohibited from using Market street;
between Front and Sixth, between: the
hours of 5 and 6:30 p. m., -and those
loaded or loading be permitted to use only
one block on the street during that time
and then be required to take a cross
street. The communication says: ,
As the roads are changing' bands, we" think
the present an opportune time to- remedy the
evils that have so long existed and. to. obtain
for the public adequate, safe and J economical
transportation. -
We call attention "to the practice 1 of leaving

ets issued to school children at 2% cents . be
good for passage at any time during school days
between S a. m. and 5 p._m. We recommend
that an 'ordinance be passed requiring street
railroads to carry the working classes for 3
cents for each fare between 6 and 8 a. m. and
Irom 5 to 6:30 n. m. - ' .
â¢ We insist that air.unused tracks be at once
taken up and the street put in proper condition
and that all obstructions be removed. . .-â¢"-
We insist upon a uniform system of transfers.
The present system is confusing and annoying.
We recommend the abolition of -the "short

City Attorney Advises
as to Geary-Street
Privilege.
Holds It Does Not Expire
Until November of Next
Year.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion with
the Board of Supervisors yesterday to the
effect that the franchise granted to the
Geary Street Railway Company does not
-expire until November 6. 1903, instead
of on April 13, 1902, as was commonly sup
posed. The opinion bears out an article
published in a recent issue of The Call, in
which it was pointed out that the Super
visors were laboring under an erroneous
impression that the franchise expired this
5 Lane directs attention to the two fran
i chises granted to the company, one on
April 13 1S77, and the other on November
6 1S7S. each to run for twenty-hve years.
Lane holds that the later franchise was
In effect a revocation of the earlier privi
lege. After quoting the law and decisions
on the matter, Lane says:
The law as announced in these cases appeals
to me as that which should apply to the pres
ent case. The franchise of 1S77 not having
been complied with in any particular, no ac
ceptance of it* privileges having been filed with
the Board of Supervisors, the work required
â¢within the time limited not having been done.
Â«nd no work whatever having been begun upon
the road â in short, no recognition having been
taken by the grantees of the privilege granted
to themâ it Is my belief that when the fran
chise of 1878 was granted it was in effect a
revocation j>f the franchise of 1877, if, indeed,
any revocation were necessary and was a valid
exercise of the power granted to the Board of
Supervisors by the State.
upon the tacts as herein presented it is ray
opinion that the franchise under which the
Geary-street. Park and | Ocean Railroad Com
pany now operates its road upon Geary street
and Point Lobos avenue is that granted to
Charles Main et al. on November 6, 1878, with
supplementary franchises, and in this belief the
city has moved for more than twenty-three
years. The franchise of 1S78 will, by virtue of
Its own conditions, expire on November 6. 1903.
My views of the law applicable herein are
based upon the premise heretofore stated,
namely, that there never had "been an accept
ance of the franchise of 1S77. and that the work
required had never been done thereunder. All
of the facts you have submitted to me, or which
I have been able to obtain from official sources
â and I am necessarily confined to such sources
â plainly indicate to me that such premise is
correct. Your board, however, has the power
at Independent investigation, and if you should
find by such investigation that aÂ« a matter ot
fact my premise Is erroneous, that is to say, if
you should find that the franchise of 1877 was
accepted and work done thereunder, then the
conclusions herein reached by me do not apply.
HEALTH AND STBJENGTH
FOB, CHILDB,EN OF P00B
Beautiful Charity of Episcopalian
Ladies Is Established at Camp
Meeker.
One of the mo^t considerate of the
many practical charities of the Episco
pal church has been established at
Camp Meeker on the North Pacific
Coast Railroad, seventy miles distant
from San Francisco. One of the most
difficult problems met with in the care
of the sick poor is the proper care of the
convalescent, especially of children. The
homes from which they are taken are in
so many cases squalid and illy situated
and the means for providing proper at
tendar.ee and stimulating food so meager
that it was impressed upon the minds of
the charitable that some place with en
vironments of quiet, fresh air and com
fort in the care of some one profession
ally competent to minister to ailing chil
dren should be provided.
The appeal made to the wealthy and
generous church women of this city met
with Instant response and friends were
quickly provided. Mrs. J. O. Lincoln of
San Mateo, wife of the principal of the
Church Divinity School, was the leader
in the enterprise, and largely through
her â¢ enthusiastic instrumentality the
Saint Dorothy's nest for convalescent
children has been founded and is now
ready for active work.
The Institution will . accommodate
twenty children. A house has been
erected of ample capacity and furnished
with every comfort. Mrs. Will Crocker
has been a liberal contributor to the
building fund, . besides assuming the
larger part of thÂ« expenses for the first
year. The ground occupied by the struc
ture, of considerable extent, was donated
by M. C. . Meeker. Located on an emi
nence commanding a wide view of the
beautiful valley of the Russian - River,
shaded by lofty redwoods and provided
â¢with every appurtenance for rural enjoy
ment, St. Dorothy's will soon open its
doors and welcome to its hospitable roof
the - helpless children for whose Â¦ benefit
It has been erected. No one, whatever
his creed, will be denied.
The. property "has been deeded to thÂ«
Bishop of California and is now one of
the regular diocesan institutions. Upon
the return of Bishop Nichols from Hono
lulu the rest will be dedicated.
Deninan Is Not Incompetent.
The writ of prohibition issued about
two weeks ago restraining School Direc
tor James Denman from participating in
the . trial of Miss Mary. C. McKlnney,
against whom a charge of incompetence
had been : preferred by Albert i Lyser,
principal of the John Swett -Grammar
School, was dismissed by Judge Hunt
yesterday. The' court held that Denman
in saying that "trie School Department
did not want any crazy teachers." did
not incapacitate him from partici
pating in the trial of Miss McKinney.
The writ dismissed two weeks ago was
issued on complaint of Attorney Stephen
V. Costello, who charged Denman with
prejudice.
MclntyTe's Brutal Assailants.
Joseph Mllllan and Charles Buchanan,
charged with assault to murder and bur
glary for breaking into the residence of
James Mclntyre. on Bryant street, on
Thursday morning, March 27, and beating
him on the head with the butt end of a
revolver, appeared before . Judge Mogan
yesterday. A certificate was read from
Dr.- Hopper to the effect that it would be
ten days yet before the old man could ap
pear in court to testify,' and the case was
continued till April 15. Klttie Mclntyre
the old man's daughter, who is In love
with MUllan. Is still being detained as a
â¢witness.

I further believe that our city's growth and
needs require that changes be made in its
charter; but will only, mention on* section
thereof, and that relates to the Board of Pub
lic Works and the Board of Police and FlrÂ«
Commissioners, composed as they are of the
Mayor,' City Attorney and City Engineer. The
tendency of the United States Government ard
of all large corporations and firms Is to cen
tralize power in one head; so â¢ modern ctty
charters centraliie powsr in the Mayor and then
hold him responsible for" commissioners appoint
ed by htm and the condition of affairs gener
ally. Appointees may all be good men when
selected, by the Mayor, but sometimes men
change their minds when temporarily clothed
with authority; so if the Mayor Is to be held
responsible for his appointees, he should havÂ»
power to remove the same: for cause.
In conclusion, gentlemen, I would also rec
ommend that there be more unity and harmony
between all departments of the city govern
ment, especially between the legislative and
executive branches. It is common rumor that
the taxpayers are heartily tired of to much
dissension for personalt gains and know full
well that the city's interest is overlooked "and
greatly suffers thereby.'
/Changes Should Be Made.
Realizing the Importance and necessity of
early action in this matter, I shall soon appoint
a committee of five or seven prominent citizens,
whose reputation and ability will be unques
tioned, to .carefully Investigate and report with
recommendations the . most ! practical | and.
feasible method for' municipal ownership : of
water, and possibly other utilities. y
Our city ha3 reached a stage of development
where we cannot much longer put off -Without
danger of losins; prestige and restricting further
progress certain other improvements. We will
soon have to consider the question of beautify
ing our present and securing other large, public
parkÂ« the Improvement of three main thor
oughfares, remodeling our sewer system and
providing more sturm water facilities, mad
necessary by annexed territory and Increased
population. , .
I -would like particularly- to call attention
to the- unsightly and dangerous .condition of
Telegraph avenue. . The property-owners on
thfs avenue have twice been taxed for perma
nent Improvements, but owing., to the poor
quality of the work done and accepted by the
city the Improvements did -not have any per
manency ' The life of the bitumen has been
spent, and the expensive repairs or patches on
it each year is equivalent to throwing -away
that much money. I recommend that proper
steps be promptly taken to make this Wide and
prominent main avenue an , attractive feature
of our city. . â¢ .l. t ;. v
' I. would recommend submitting. to the peoepla
the question of municipal ownership of water.
This matter has become & crying necessity, for.
with the present condition of private ownership,
it cannot help being a bone of contention in
our body politic, which has and always will de
stroy ' .confidence in our- municipal affairs and
retard the growth and prosperity of our city.
Ownership of Water.
~ I would ' again call attention of your hon
orable body to the fact that one of the first
and most Important Improvements, which I
think should be submitted to the people, is
the erection of a new City Hall. All agree
that the old City Hall Is too small for present
needs and requirements of our city. For one.
reason still more Important would- 1 press the
need of a new City Hall upon the attention
of your honorable body, as well as of the pub-
He, and that is the imperative need of are
proof vaults to preserve our records, the de
struction of which would entail endless trou
ble and possibly great loss- to the city. No
prudent business man would think of keeping
such valuable documents in a wooden build-
Ing.
Another great and important need. I think, is
more good school buildings to accommodate
the- steadily increasing enrollment of schojl
children. Our educational department should
keep pace with the rapid growth of the city,
or, better still, keep ahead of it.
In view of the . fact that we have over 20C0
crosswalks in a worn-out and dangerous con
dition, especially in the older and more thickly
settled portions of the city, and it is unlikely
that any means can be obtained from tha tax
levy- to- repair same,. I would recommend sub
mitting, to the people the question of bonds for
repairing with bitumen all crosswalks and cul
verts throughont the city; \ Â¦ .* : "-*.\^r

the passage of an ordinance taxing vari
ous businesses to increase the income of

follows: â¢ ..; - o-- Â¦ - â¢". .
The Mayor then took up each depart
ment of the Â¦ city government and â¢ an
alyzed each â¢ separately. He - paid the
highest compliments to- the Fire, Police,
Street, Fire Alarm and Police Telegraph,

Our income iÂ» based upon a rery low assessed
valuation of city property, and restricted by
the city charter to 1 per cent_of our popu
lation aqd class, so that when unusual items
Of cost or expense . occur, like the defense of
the water rate -suit, and Increased water rates
for flre hydrants, we cannot expect any per
manent improvements, but have to practice tha
closest economy to provide proper maintenance.
The average taxpayer who understands this
situation Â¦ can reasonably expect but little per
manent-improvements In any one year or term,
and must realize that only a bonded indebted-*
ness will afford the improvements necessary to
promote our city's best Interests. .
Following this general statement of pol
icy, the Mayor announced that he favored
improvement clubs as bringing the peo
ple into closer touch with municipal af
fairs. Speaking of the inability of the ad
ministration to make permanent Improve
ments, he said:
It Is said of a man who is seeking a city
or town for -the purpose of locating a business
or Investing capital, that some of the Brat ques
tions he asks are: "What is the financial con
dition of -the elty? What Is the tax levy.*
Is the valuation of property for. tax purposes
high or low, as compared with its real. value?
These inquiries are at least among the first.
and ofttime the. answers to them decide the
question of Investment. Tnt levy. Indebted
ness and public improvements are the things
to â¢ be considered In determining the character
and management of a city government.

"What the world wants to-day Is prac
tical men. not theorists. After a common
school education the time spent in learn
ing some trade or business will tend more
to a young man's success in life than the
years spent in securing a high school edu
cation. The high school boy Is usually
not inclined to begin at the bottom of the
ladder in the common walks of life then
open to him."
. The other speakers were S. D. Water
man, the Berkeley School Superintendent;
Superintendent of the California Cotton
Mills Myron T. Holcomb; A. A. Denison,"

"Bob" Smith's ! Marshal Nell won the
selling event over a mile and a hundred
yards. Eight to five was quoted in profu
sion, and he led Decoy over the finishing
line eight lengths. Constable, ridden by
Bill Knapp gave Decoy a hard rub for
the place. losing out by a neck only.
After his flagrant exhibition of care
lessness on Bernota, favorite for- the
closing seven furlong run, Ransch should
give up trying to draw fine finishes. Get
ting away well, Bernota was shortly after
cut off. Ranpcli then waded through the
bunch with his mount without any more
effort than breaking glass balls with a
cut-off shotgun. Galloping into the
stretch "Jerry" began taking the favorite
up. when he was passed near the. pad
dock and beaten more- than half a length
by Kickumbob. a 6 and 7 to 1 shot, pilot
ed by Jackson.*
Only four lined up in the Altamax hand
icap at a mile, with Constellitor closing
a 6 to 5 favorite. Ransch also had the
mount ox* this choice, and after racing
Beau Ormonde to a standstill breezed
home an easy first in 1:43%. Colonel Bal
lantyne took the place, four lengths in
front of Ormonde. Waterscratch, which
opened favorite, went back in the betting
to 13 to 5 and apparently could not keep
within hailing distance of the leader the
first three-quarters. While moving up
some in the stretch the big three-year-old
slipped, going to his knees. Scrambling
to his feet he swerved toward the inner
rail and was pulled up In a very lame
condition. Quite likely he will not be
able to race again this season.
Practically unbacked, Skip Me, a 15 to 1
shot, took the Introductory sprint in a
hard drive from Victoria S. another out
elder. Marlneuse, the favorite, backed up
by gradual stages after the start, losing
the show to Blackthorn. Canderos also
failed to do, what was expected of him.
Alsono, the chestnut son of Altamax,
from the Burns & Waterhouse stable,
made auick work of the other starters in
the two-year-old scramble. A 4 to 5
favorite, Ransch soon . had him in front
and he disposed of Barney Schreiber's
Deutschland without effort. Arabo
finished a good third.
The track was in a somewhat slushy
condition and the time recorded was slow
in most instances. /Favorites captured
four of the races run, keeping the book
makers shortening sail almost from the
start. - '
seemed to have completely re
covered from her attack of locomotor
ataxia, for with 98 pounds up she made
P. Ryan's useful mare Obia look like 30
cents in the seven furlong event, third to
be decided. At one stage of the betting
7 to 5 could be had about Eonic, although
she closed at 7 to 10. and with Lee Jack-
Eon in the saddle beat Obia by a length
and possessing considerable in reserve.
Sir Hampton and the others were out
classed and outfooted. The winner was
entered to be sold for $400, and in easy
stages "Packey" Ryan bumped the price
up to 11500; then he rested. Caesar Young
responded with the customary $5 bid and
the mare was led back to her old stable

"Golden Gate avenue
Is now a lagoon,"
Sang the good people
On Sunday at noon.
And "Swim Out for Glory"
They sans at their kirks
And offered a. prayer
For our fine Board of Works.
downpour on Sunday brought
1 1 upon the wise heads of the Board
I of Works new and original ana-
JJL themas, for Golden Gate avenue,
now much depressed; was a veri
table swamp. Strangers who traversed
the locality imagined that the water-filled
holes were so many natural springs or
overflowing wells, and in consequence of
several narrow escapes from drowning it
was deemed advisable for the proper safe
ty of the public to call for the assistance
of the men of the various life-savins sta
tions.
They came with boats and cork life
preservers, and launched their craft \ in
the vicinity of Leavenworth street. Their
timely presence was fortunate, for within
an hour the occupants of three vehicles
had jolted out into the Golden Gate-ave
nue lakes, and, had it not been for the
rescuers, might have been carried away
by the tide which flowed from hole lo
hole in torrents that resembled the over
flow at Niagara Falls.
Several economical parents, to save car
fare to the beach, stripped their dear off
spring of ' their shoes and stockings and
sent, them to wade and paddle in the
puddles. Cattle, having heard of the
Golden Gate-avenue ditches, came friskily
to town from San Mateo to cool their
hoofs and quench their thirst, and milk
men brought their pails from adjacent
dairies. .. . Â¦ . .
Then arose a heated argument between
officials of the Spring Valley 'Water Com
pany and those who favor the city's own-
Ing its own water works. The former
contended that it had the copyright on
water supply, and therefore threatened to
obtain a writ of injunction against any
other corporation that might desire pub
licly or surreptitiously to take by mouth,
pipe or other means one drop of that pre
cious water. The members pf the Board
of Works were called up "by telephone;
and while the wrangling was at flood-tide,
came upon the scene and defiantly argued
and persuaded and pleaded that to no
one else did the water holes of the ave
nue belong .but to them. . .;,
The monopolistic argument advanced by
the board drowned alL opposition, and so
the Spring Valley Company officials went
'way back to Lake Merced, while those
who . favor the city's ownership of the
water supply retired to discuss the ad
visability of calling a mass meeting to
consider, whether the Board of Works ia
justified in maintaining and encouraging
an unlimited set of reservoirs on the once
favored drive.
' Owners of fishing smacks have taken
issue with those who oppose the original
device of the Board of Works, and, in a
petition to the board, they give as a rea
son why the water holes should not be
disturbed the plausible contention that
while the lives of the fishermen are im
periled by the variable gales on the bay
fishing could be indulged in on Golden
Gate avenue with comparative safety to
life and craft.
-Yesterday several well-known oystsr
merchants visited the avenue and unani
mously declared that the water holes
would make admirable oyster beds. ." They
have already drafted- a concise and lucid
petition to be presented to' the 'Board * of
Works at an early date, in which they
pray' for the sole right to the holes for
the cultivation of the bivalves.
The Board of Works, however will
hardly care to part with' its very own
pet scheme. It maintains the avenue in
its present condition wit** a sublime
tenacity. â¢

Jack O'Brien will box "Kid" Williams
Â£t Stockton on April 15. The preliminary
battle will be between Snailham and Gil
feather.
On Friday evening next Eddie Hanlon
and Frankie Xeal will box ten rounds be
fore the Acme Club, Oakland. They aie
training hard for the contest. Dave Barry
and Harry Foley, two clever welter
weights, will box ten rounds the same
night. Manager Lavigne is making an
effort to match Tim Heggerty and Rufe
Turner for April 23.
On the evening of April 15 the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club will give its regular
monthly boxing exhibition. For the main
event Tody Everett and Joe Angeli will
box four rounds for the amateur light
weight championship of the coast. A spe
cial match has been arranged between
George Peterson of the Olympic Club and
George Saul&bury. Manager Levy tried
to match Peterson against Teddy Wolff,
but the last named does not want any of
Peterson's game for some time to come.
The other contests will be between Wil
liam Cardelll and Fred Carter, Joe Hall
'and Joe McDonald, "Monte" Attel and
John Crow, Lou Powell and Eddie Galla
tin and Phil O'Mera and Otto Knoch.
These bouts will be four rounds each, and
will be refereed by Jimmy McDevitt.
This evening "Kid" McFadden and
"Spider" Welch will battle at the Reli
ance Club. Both men have trained faith
fully for the contest. A large delegation
of sports will cross the bay to see the
contest.
On the evening of April 23 the Olympic
Club wiil hold its regular "ladies' night."
Leader Hammersmith is arranging an ex
cellent programme. Twenty-tour wres
tlers will appear on the mat at the same
lime and exhibit their skill.
The Olympic Athletic Club will show
Its appreciation for the kindly treat
ment accorded its members by the Bur
lingame Country Club by giving a boxing
Eight in its special honor the latter part
of next month. The affair is being ar
ranged by the club's leader, John Ham
mersmith. Special invitations will be sent
to every member of the Burlingame Club
and they will be treated to some of the
best boxing bouts ever presented at the
local athletic institution. Ko outsiders
â¢will be able to enter the clubhouse on the
night of the exhibition. The affair vlll
be exclusively for members of the two
clubs. The friendly reeling that exists
between the two organizations is being
developed, as both are promoters of am
ateur sport. A baseball game between
teams irom each club is in prospect-
Manager Muma of the Olympic Club has
issued a challenge in behalf of his team.
Hayes Valley Association Has
Fine Card for This,
Month.
Amid the hustle and bustle which ac
companied the opening of the baseball
season poor Charley Sweeney passed into
the great unknown, friendless and penni
less, at the City and County Hospital.
Sweeney was one of the greatest pitchers
the, world has ever known. .: In his prime
he played with the old Providence club,
and was heralded as a wonder wherever
he went. He died alone, however, forgot
ten by the thousands who once cheered
him. â¢
It is a noteworthy fact that the people
of Los Angeles have not begun to kick at
the umpires yet. It is to be hoped that
they will continue to be good, for if they
once begin it will. be necessary to have a
couple of umpires built to order for their
especial benefit. .
Captain Shugart handles i the willow
equally well from! either side, something
very unusual for a batsman. Consequent
ly all pitchers are alike to him, whether
they be southpaws or right-handers. ..
Unglaub, the Senators' second baseman,
is as trim a ball player as any who ever
acted on the local field. If he plays as
good a game as Flood did last year the
Sacramento public will be well satisfied.
Rube Waddell showed the Los Angeles
cranks' that he could field and hit a little.
For some unknown reason .Waddell was
hit hard in the opening game, but on Sun
day he did some very clever chasing in
right field, and won the game 'with a long
drive to center.
Hodson of Oakland predicted'that Law
lor, the local center fielder, could navigate
to first as fast as Dougherty,' who played
with Los Angeles last year. Hodson is
not wrong" in his prediction, for Lawldr
gets down to the first bag as fast as any
player ever seen at Recreation Park, with
the possible exception of Barrett and
Mercer of the All-Americas. â¢
George Decker was replaced by Ather
ton in the Oakland-Los Angeles game on
Sunday. Decker signed with Money for
the season, and assured the southern
magnate that he would soon regain his
old-time form. He fell down at a critical
period . during the opening contest, how
ever, and Morley was afraid to trust him
further. Decker wa.s the best first base
man in the National League a few years
ago. If he fails to make good he will
soon be forgotten, like Amos Rusie, John
Clarkson and numerous others who shone
in the past.
Nordyke hits the ball just as hard as
ever. In the first game I he Â¦ rapped out a
four-cushion swipe, and on Sunday got
two singles. Dyke will no doubt be among,
the top-notchers In the average column
when the season Is well advanced. r
Captain Shugart has made quite an im
pression on the crowd, though they; have
seen him play but Vwice. tvery time he
comes to the, bat cries of*"Hlt it out, Cap"
greet him fr.om all sides. _ .. -
, San Francisco and Sacramento will com
mence a new series of six games, begin
ning to-morrow at Oakland. The AVednes.
day game across the bay is' a new addi
tion. It -will afford the fans > in the
suburban towns a chance to witness" two
games a week instead of one, and as thÂ«;
race for the flag becomes more interest
ing undoubtedly many of this city's en
thusiasts will make the run over the pond.

Claim the Oleomargarine Bill Za a
Host Vicious Measure in
Principle.
DENVER, April 7.â President John W.
Springer of the National Livestock As
sociation, when interviewed with refer
ence to the passage of the oleomargarine
bill in the Senate,, said:
The livestock interests of the United 8tatea
are not discouraged by the small vote by
which they were beaten in the Senate on the
oleomargarine bill. | We had hoped to beat tha
bill In the Senate and expect to defeat it be
fore - we are done with - It. ' It ia the moat
vicious measure ' In principle ever voted on by
an American - Congress and we shall content
the matter in the House, where the bill now
goes, in conference, and before the- President,
and if forced to do so. through the Supremo
Court of the United States.
If the Senate of the United States can by a
narrow margin of eight votes enact a law
which strikes down one industry which has
teen . built up under Federal enactment to
directly benefit the creamery trust of the
United Statea then any other one industry can
be singled out for destruction, and it would
only be necessary to spend enough money and
threaten enough Congressmen and Senators
with the "farmer" vote to completely encom
pass the 'Â¦Â¦ annihilation of any American in
dustry. The livestock people of the United
States firmly believe that the Supreme Court
will never uphold such a principle.

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YOPJC. April 7. â The upward move
iKect of stocks, which had attained some head
way during the latter part or last week, did
not prot-per to-<lay in face of the rapidly con
tracting supplies In the money market. The
stocks which were made the leaders of last
veek's movement were the chief sufferers from
the selling. The total volume of dealings fell
considerably below the 1,000,000-share mark
touched on Friday, but considerably more than
one-third of the total v.-as made up of St. Paul,
Louisville and Nashville and Union Pacific.
The selling cost St. Paul 2%. Louisville and
Nashville 1% and Union Pacific 1%.. This
course of events naturally detracted somewhat
from the interest in the conjectures of the
source of the heavy demand for these stocks
and the community of interest and merger pro
ject which mlgnt be aimed at. Wall streefs
suspicion of last week that the movement was
a speculative maneuver to invite a following
in the general market was strengthened. The
ebrupt reaction in these stocks as a result of
the developments In the money market was
chiefly remarkable from the fact that those
developments were generally admitted to be
Impending last -week. The answer made to
this was that abundance of capital In the West
Â¦would relieve the situation and would give
free scope to the buying of stocks. But when
the call money rate ehot up to 7 per cent this
afternoon, the higtiest point of the season, this
assurance did not avail to prevent throwing
over of large amounts of etock. All portions
cf the list were affected and to-day's losses run
quite generally from 1 to 2 and over that in
exceptional cases. Amalgamated Copper ig
nored the general tendency of the market, as
It fiid when the market was going up. and rose
at the last of the day to 1% over last week.
Other firm spots were In the local tractions,
come of the express companies, Weetinghoune
Electric, Chicago and Alton, the Wisconsin
Central stocks and the Duluth. South Shore
and Atlantic stocks. The action of the day's
grain markets gave some intimation that last
/Week's stock market assumptions of the safety
Tt.' the winter* wheat crop were -somewhat pre
mature. But the flurry In the money market
was the overshadowing Influence and the mar
ket closed active and easy and generally at the
lowest.
A few of the newer bond issues were ad
vanced, but the general tendency was ellghtly
easier In sympathy with stocks. Total sales,
par value. $4.C4O,OO0.
United Btates bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.
New York Stock Market.
EASTERN MARKETS.
Chicago broke sharply on ! stop orders, long
selling and heavy sales by brokers, presumably
for packers, but there was a partial recovery
toward the Â¦ close. Pork dropped from $16 55
to $10 25, closing at $16 42%. Lard declined
from $9 02% to $9 35, closing at $9 47%, and
Ribs declined from $8 87% to $8 72%, closing
at $8 75. It was -thought that the closing,
buying which caused the .recovery,' was by
those parties who had sold early. .Â¦
-The San Francisco market opened dull and
unsatisfactory, and even those few dealers who
have hitherto reported an active 'market now
say that trade Is- very elow. . : - â¢Â¦ Â¦â¢ i

CHICAGO, April 7. â At the outset there were
numerous bullish Influences at work in the
wheat pit.' Cables were steady and the market
was helped by a big drop in temperature.
The Kansas State report was the early bull
lactor. This estimate,' which Saturday was'
reported at 74, was corrected to-day to a con
dition of only 70, as compared with 105 a year
ago. Uhe report aluo showed a loss of 400, OtW
in the acreage irom last year ana a possible
deeitase in me yield of 30.0w.000 butheis.

A Chicago paper primed an exhaustive report
tst crop conditions," wnlch. In spite or the dam
ages in tne Southwest. . pruruieed about tfte
came crop as. last year. This lactor, together
with large weekly shipments and a smaller de
crease in the vuible supply of 1.000.UUU bushels
less . than had been \ expected, wore away the
t-age of the bullish entnuslasm and wheat be-
Ka.11 to weaken. Corn, which had some fair
early support, also turned weak and helped
push wheat backward. May' wheat declined
to 70%@70%c, but the bulls turned in again
to the support of the market. Shorts covered
again and there was a good rally. May closing
lirm, %c higher, at 71%@71%c.
Corn ruled weak again. At the opening the
pit crowd loaded up pretty well with long
stuff and when wheat eased they tried to sell,
but found that nobody wanted it at the high
pYices. May closed weak, %c down, at 57%
Â©58c.
There was little Interest in oats. May closed
easy, %c down, at 42%c
Provisions fluctuated widely again on manip
ulation. The opening prices were higher on
the better hog market and the grain strength.
Liquidation soon set in, however, and carried
all prices downward. May pork closed 5c
lower; rani 12%c down and ribs 12%c lower. '

' WHEATâ The foreign markets showed* no
change. The world's shipments for the week
were as follows, in quarters: Russian, 230,000;
Danublan, 79,000; Argentine, 145,000; Indian,
28,000; Australian, 35.000. The American vis
ible supply decreased 1,151,000 bushels. ..- Â¦
Chicago opened firm on unfavorable weather,
the Kansas State report and' free commission
buying, but afterward weakened on liberal sell
ing, -lack of outside support and the weakness
in corn. The largely increased acreage was a
card for the bears. Cudahy, Armour and the
Southwest sold freely and the crowd was
against any advance. Thus far the State re
ports: as Issued show the following status of
the crop as compared with the same time last
year: Kansas,- 70, against- 105; Missouri,-. 90,

StateB - Supreme Court Â¦ an opinion was
delivered to-day by. Justice Brewer In the
case; of "Pine and others against the * city
of -New York " and . Controller ' Bird S
Coler, â¢ Involving ,th<j right of the city to
appropriate all, water of a stream along
which the complainants resided. The
case was decided against the "city by the
Court of Appeals. ,but to-day's opinion
reversed the finding and remanded the
case ' for. .further . hearing with instruc
tions'to consider the question of damage.
New York Water Case Is Reversed
"Without subjecting ' the" bill to minute criti
cism, we . think its averments sufficient to
present the. question as to -the. power of one
State of the Union to wholly deprive another
of the benefit of . water: from a river in the
former, and,- by nature,-. Bowing Into and
through the latter, and that," therefore, this
court, speafclng broadly, has jurisdiction.
! Coming to the question of the demurrer;
,he Bald: â¢ r
The general rule is that the truth of ma
terial and relevant matters set forth with
requisite precision are admitted by demurrer,
but in .a,case;of. this magnitude, ' Involving
questions of so grave and far-reaching: impor
tance,'It does not seem to us wise to apply that
rule and we must decline to do so. ' '. . ...
. He then stated the averments ' of the
contention of the States of Kansas and
Colorado, .concluding as follows:
Sitting, as It were, as an International as
well as a domestic tribunal.. we apply Federal
law. State law and international law as the
exigencies of the particular case may demand
and We are unwilling in this case to proceed
on the 'mere technical admissions made by de
murrer. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ . â¢
"Xcr do we regard It necessary, whatever Im
perfections a close analysis of the pending bill
may disclose, to compel its amendment at this
stage of the litigation. \V g think - the record
.should, show on proofs whether Colorado Is
herself actually threatening to wholly exhaust
the flow, of. the Arkansas.. River.' In Kansas;
whether, .what Is described | In the bill 'as the
"underflow" : is a subterranean stream flowing
in 'a known and defined channel, and not mere
ly "water percolating through the strata be
low; whether certain persons, firms' or corpora
tions In ' Colorado must be made parties there
to; what lands in Kansas are actually situated
on the banks of the Arkansas River and what
either .'in Colorado or Kansas, are absolutely
dependent on Â¦ water therefrom; Â¦ the Â« extent Â¦ of
the watershed â¢ or the drainage area of the
Arkansas River; the possibilities of the main
tenance of a sustained, flow through the control
ol flood waters; In short.' the circumstances
a (variation in which might induce a court" to
either grant,- modify or deny. the relief sought
or any part . thereof .. In view. of the intricate
questions ' arising on . the record we are con
strained to forbear proceedings until all the
facts are before us on. the evidence. Â¦"â¢"â¢Â¦
There was no dissenting opinion.
WASHINGTON, April <f.â The United
States Supreme Court in an opinion de
livered , by Chief Justice Fuller to-day
overruled" the demurrer of the State of
Colorado in the case of the State of Kan
sas vs.' the State of Colorado. The case in
volves, the right of Colorado to appro
prlate for purposes: of Irrigation the
waters of the Arkansas River, which
Kansas sought, by an original action to
restrain," on the ground that the stream
flows through 'Kansas and the people of
the latter State are. Injured by. such ap
propriation of the water. Colorado ; con
tested the jurisdiction of the court in the
case and filed a demurrer^. The Chief
Justice said that the case is one in which
the court can properly assume jurisdic
tion. He said also that the action of the
court in overruling the demurrer was in
tended to "be" without prejudice, but was
taken because , the importance of the case
was such that It should not be decided
without full proof on the questions set up
in the allegations of damage made by the
State of Kansas. â¢-

Justice said: â¢

A suit for divorce on the ground of fail
ure to provide was filed by Matilda Leven
berg against Samuel Levenberg yester
day. Â¦ They were married in 1862. Mrs.
Levenberg also asks the court to restrain
the Hibernia Bank from paying to her
husband any sum he has pn deposit, with
the Institution and to prevent the firm of
Magee & Sons from selling certain land,
which she claims to be community prop
erty, to Warren Olney. .
The plaintiff alleges that Levenberg has
$500 on deposit in the Hibernia Bank and
that there is also in the hands of Magee
& Sons the sum of $500, received from Ol
ney as a deposit binding the sale ef a
ranch in San Mateo and a lot at the cor
ner of Church and Market streets in this
city. She alleges that her husband has
agreed, to sell both pieces of land to Ol
ney and that unless he. is restrained by
the court he will convert the proceeds of
the sale to his own use. ,i
y George Gray, a member of -the firm or
Gray Bros., contractors, who was di
vorced from Madge F. Gray in December,
18U8, has been cited to appear before
Judge Troutt Friday, April 11. to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court for falling to comply
with the order of court directing him to
pay his wife *200 per month alimony for
the support of herself and two children.
Mrs. Gray alleges that there is now ow
ing to her, the sum of $600 back alimony.
.The Grays have been in court many times
since Mrs. Gray secured a divorce on the
ground of cruelty and the question of ali
mony has been v the bone of legal conten
tion. Gray, was ordered to pay his wife
$250 per month for one year after the de
cree of dviorce was granted, at the end of
which he^was to pay her $200 per month.
During the first year he gave his wife
several large sums in addition to the
monthly alimony. He failed to pay the
alimony for several months and Mrs.
Gray brought suit to recover the amount
due under the orders of the court. Gray
opposed the suit 'on the ground that the
.money he had advanced Mrs. Gray was
alimony and that he did not owe her any
thing. Mrs. Gray claimed that the money
was expended for the care of the two chil
dren in sickness and therefore was not to
be considered a part of the alimony. The
case was bitterly fought and resulted In
a partial victory for Mrs. Gray.
Suits for divorce were filed yesterday
by A. B. Howell against Nellie Howell for
desertion. Marguerite Brammertz against
R. I. Brammertz for failure to provide,
Henry N. James against Alice M. James
for desertion, Ena M. Acock against Wil
liam M. Acock for failure to provide. Lulu
Parsons against W. H. Parsons for
cruelty and Mary Bowen against John M.
Bo wen for failure to provide.

The paintings are from the brush of a
young artist who gives promise of lead

events. His brush has depicted events
that are familiar to the mind of every
American. The picture called "A Salute

great interest by Californians. "Jim"

Two remarkable pictures from the

to the maple room of the Palace
Hotel yesterday and last , night. The
canvases were seen to great advan
tage by reason of the electric lights,
that cast their rays from all sides. These
valuable paintings are historical in their
character and highly artistic in their de

It is evident the orders are that none but
Case men are to remain on guard. So far as
this county is concerned, however, the scheme
of Gage and Krvane will not work Major
Cunningham is an old and respected cltlren of
ITkiah and his attempted removal has aroused
great indignation irrespective of party lines.
Mr. Cunningham is a Democrat, but during
his r!x year*" incumbency as secretary has
laken no part in political intrigue. He will re
flet removal through the courts, as he was
Cit.misFfi without cause. It is hinted that the
head of Medical Superintendent King is a!moÂ«t
rÂ»ady to drop under the Gage guillotine, as fa
has l>cen so indiscreet as to speak favorably of
Flint,
Saturday's attempt to remo\ - e Secretary Dur
can failed for the time beins. 'It is quietly
â¢Rhirpered around that the rearon for t'hÂ» fail
ure in this part of Gage's programme is to be
found in certain business relations which exist
fcttween Duncan and Manager Templeton The
orders of Kevane apainst Cunningham went
through, however, though only by a , vote of
three to two. It is understood that the ma
j-rity. who obeyed orders, were Fehnemann
Truman and Tompleton. while Hockheimer and
MartlncIH etood by their faithful and efficient
secretary.
Dunsan is a brother of Supervisor A M.
Duncan of this city, who Is connected with a
transfer company In San Francisco and ha* an
office there. The Duncans ar* understood to
fce for Flint for Governor. Some months ago
in order to placate A. M. Duncan, and if pos
sible secure his Influence In thiR county Gov

But apparently the plan dirt not work for

LKIAH, April 7.â At a meeting held here
Saturday afternoon the board of managers of
the Mendocino State Hospital dismissed their
eecretary. Major \V. XV. Cunningham, who
had h*ld the position acceptably for six years
and appointed In his stead George L.. Smith,
v.as ence a deputy clerk in Trinity Coun
ty, and who, it Is understood here, has lately
been employed on a street car line in San
Francisco. Insid* information Is to the effect
that Dan Kevane gave direct orders that Sec
retary Cunningham and also John J. Duncan,
the secretary to the medical superintendent,
trust be removed.
Mendocino Asylum.
The Kcvaning- of another State Institu
tion has begun. This time It is the,Men
docino Asylum for the Insane. A corre
spondent at Ukiah gives the following
history of the deal:
There are no Indications that Gage has
made any personal sacrifices for the ben
efit of the State. In fact, the Los Angeles
law office has fared pretty well at the
public trough. Since Gage was inaugu
rated he has drawn from the tM^sury
519.500 on salary account, to say nothing
of his account with the contingent or ss
cret service fund. Foley of the Los An
geles law office has drawn $13,000. and the
Hon. Daniel Kevane of the same office
- lias received $9750. The sum of $42,250 to
date on salary account Is not bad for the
law office. It is understood that Orator
George A. Knight has been engaged by
the Governor to depict the charms of the
low tax rate. The orator is amply quali
fied to define the relation between the
. taxpayer and the taxeater. True, the
common people must be treated to high
â¢ flights of oratory, but the price is occa
- sionally higher than the flight. Since 1882
Orator Knight has drawn from the State
treasury a sum slightly in excess of $32,030.
As- Insurance Commissioner from 18S2 to
JSS6 he drew $12,000. As attorney for the
State Board of Health under Markham's
administration he drew down $12,S65 65. As
attorney for the same board under this
administration he has drawn to date $7750.
His son is on the Federal pay roll as Na
tional Bank Inspector.
The Los Angeles Law Office.
assessment roll expands. The assessable
Â¦wealth of San Francisco now exceeds
$490,000,000. This year Los Angeles County
will reach the JIOO.000,000 mark on the as
sessment roll. The State entered upon
the present era of industrial prosperity
shortly after the election of William Mc-
Kinley to the Presidency in 1896. Owing
to the great expansion of the assessment
roll, due to the increased wealth of the
State, the Gage administration has had
money to throw at the birds. The money
has been collected and paid into the treas
ury, as the figures of the Treasurer and
Controller will show.
Gage's Fight and the Kailroad.
The indiscreet supporters of the "Colo
nel" apply the vilest epithets to Gage's
chief Democratic adviser. Herrin is said
to be sick of the whole business. The
Insolence of Eddie Conroy was more
than he bargained for in the beginning
of his checkered political career. When
Harriman arrives a railway council may
be called to consider the advisability of
pulling all the departments of the com
j.any out of the present gubernatorial
contest. Deprived of the aid of the
Southern Pacific, Gage could not Â¦ win a
friendly delegation in any county of the
State â not even in Santa Clara, where
the push is so strongly Intrenched. The
Governor; knowing the weakness of his
own position, refuses to .give the order
to banish Crimmins from the reserva
tion. Perhaps Burns will take another
dose of the bitter medicine and strive to
look cheerful in the presence of his fol
lowers.
The machine gang goes into rhapsodies
over the State tax levy, and gives to the
Governor all the credit for economical ad
ministration of State affairs. There has
been no reduction whatever in the ex
pense of governing California. The usual
allowances were made by the last Legis
lature for the maintenance of State insti
tutions and the various commissions. The
Legislature appropriated the customary
amount of money and the Governor gave
his approval to the legislation. The low
tax rate is due entirely to the increase of
taxable property. A tax of 40 cents on tile
$100 produces a vast sum of money when
it is applied to an assessment roll em
bracing $1,200,000,000 of real and personal
property. The tax rate diminishes as the
Democratic camp. Hearst begins to ap
prehend that the Democratic organiza
tion cannot be lined up to nominate a
nobody to oppose Gage in the event of
the iatter's nomination. The rumor that
the organization is sending out for prox
ies Is absurd, as delegates have not been
chosen. Moreover delegates elected
under the provisions of the primary elec
tion law cannot be represented by proxy.
Hearst is standing hi with Gage. The
dullest observer pan see that far. Lead
ing Democrats connected with the
local organization fancy that either
Washington Dodge. Barney Murphy
or Franklin 1C. I>ane can beat Gage.
Hearst suspects that they have
correctly sized up the situation, hence he
is ready to break In and smash the or
ganization's slate. There are rumors of
discontent and discord in the Republican
wing of Gage's forces. Herrin. one of
Gage's Democratic advisers, refuses to
respect the Burns decree that Crimmina
must be banished. Gage stands by Her
rin. much to the chagrin of Burns.
Stories come from the camp to the effect
that the "Colonel" is putting on his war
paint and sharpening his tomahawk. He
â¢will stand for tne retention of Dryden as
assistant chief wharfinger, rather than
break the pÂ«ace of the council, but he
swears that he will not do politics with
any man, high or low, who recognizes
Crimmins.
The Hint in Hearst's morning paper
that A. G. Fisk Is aspiring to the Speak
ership is a blind. Fisk is Hearst's Re
publican candidate for Attorney General.
All signs point to a big rumpus in the
"In view of my official capacity it would
not be right for me to say anything. The
State Department can say whatever it
likes, but I must be excused under the
circumstances from saying anything on
the matter."
One feature of Mr. Reid's visit to Mill
brae has been the absolute lack of enter
tainment at the Mills mansion, since it
has been the desire of the distinguished
visitor to enjoy immunity from social
calls. He has rarely gone beyond the
grounds since his stay at Millbrae, and
with the exception of a two days' visit on
the part of John Sloane of New York
there have been no visitors to the house.
Whitelaw Reid, who is at present at the
D. O. Mills home at Millbrae, refuses to
either affirm or deny the report received
Sunday from Washington to the effect
that he and the members of his special
embassy would pay their own expenses
during their visit to England as the spe
cial representatives of the United States
Government at the coronation of King
Edward. In regard to the report Sir. Reid
said:
