Warden Aguirre and his cronies have
secured quantities of horsehair and silk
for chairs and lounges and the articles
have been charged to "general repairs"
for the prison. The Call is prepared to
prove that in a certain month lumber
amounting to $975 was purchased for
the prison at San Quentin and in the
falsified books was charged to the jute-
The records of the San Quentin
prison show that considerable furniture,
made in the prison, has been shipped to
the city of Los Angeles. At the proper
time The Call will present the proof,
showing to whom the furniture was
shipped.
In charging that Governor Gage is
the beneficiary of the felonies com
mitted by Warden Asruirre and his
convict aides The Call will later on
present further proof.
Warden Aguirre has in the past few
months utilized the services .of .convicts
to make elaborate household and of
fice furniture. The material for the
same has been obtained by fraud. The
lumber has been charged up. to the
prison jutemill and other accounts:
convicts supported by the State have
been employed for months in making
the furniture, and the articles have been
presented by Warden Aguirre to his
friends or converted to his own use.
The making of furniture for the pub
lic in the State prisons by the labor of
convicts is absolutely prohibited by act
cf Legislature.

he was lying and he had good reason for
denying that any furniture was. being
made in the prison or that any furniture
was to be seen there as the product of
convict labor. .

has been discussed.
"Well, I should think so. Personally X
was always in favor of paying the War
den a stated salary* and then let them
pay for all maintenance out of that sura.
This $100 is only for food. All servants
in the house are convicts, the house rent
costs nothing, and even water and gscs
are furnished him free. There is one b!g
meter that acts for the whole prison. The
fpod is procured cheaper than any out
rider could even get it. Meat, for in
stance. The best of it only costs about 6
cents a pound. His coal is furnished at
about ?S per ton, whereas I pay $13 or $14
for the same kind. There are lots of
vegetables grown on the prison grounds
that are used and don't cost anything.
So you see the Warden ought to do a
great amount of entertaining on $130 a
month. He has done lota of it since ha
has been there. -Whether or. not this
entertaining > is right and proper ' in the
eyes of the taxpayers of the State or
whether it should be criticized is a i ques
tion.. The Warden necessarily has to en
tertain. Sheriffs, Judges* and even Su
perior Judges are frequent visitors to the
prison. At those times he is supposed to
treat them nicely.' It seems to me that it
ought to be done on $100. I know I have
often asked him if the amount allowed
was sufficient * and Martin - VrouW \say it
was plenty. In. regard to k these ; night
shirts I have no doubt, but what I have
slept in them. There are five rooms In

aware that any furniture had been man
ufactured within the last three or four
years, although I suppose if any was
wanted or required the Warden could
have it made. If he wished any repairs
he could have them dtine."
"Do you know that furniture has been
made and sold within the last few
weeks?" was askedV
"No. I am not a-^gre of it.".
"Do you know that there is now a large
amount under construction?"
"No, I was not aware of that, either.
You see when it was decided years ago
to abandon the manufacture of furniture
there was a very large supply of hard
wood and other fine material on hand."
said Mr. Wilkins. "Until this material
was consumed furniture was made, but
this was supposed to have been the caae
four or five years ago."
"Well, you know, years ago the manu
facture of furniture -was the chief indus
try at the penitentiary.' There was a com
plete furniture and sash and door factory
there from which* large quantities were
turned out. Later this manufacture was
only for consumption at State institutions,
such as the deaf and dumb 'asylum, etc..

The Call to San Quentin prison for the
purpose of investigating the records
consternation has reigned in the institu
tion. A cousin of Warden Aguirre has
for two 'days past been busily engaged
with a number of convicts in hiding
away the furniture that has been made
by convicts for ' .> the Warden, his
brother and his friend McClure of Los
Angeles. Some of the guards have a
quantity of. old furniture stored away in
the big abandoned furniture factory,
and in some of the dismal; rooms the
Warden's cousin and convicts have hid
den â¢ away the" "hew " furniture, piling
up around it the old articles belonging
to the guards.
The corrupt ring of swindlers and for
gers, in control of San Quentin prison
are trembling-in their.shoes now that an
investigation of affairs is to be held by
the Prison Directors.
Consultations have been" held by
members of the ring and the question of

GAGE FIGHTS SHY OF THE FORGED BILLS
TST ,,\ OS ANGELES. May 26.â The following interview
H with Governor- Gage appears in the Record this
H afternoon: ; . !Â¦
ft H|M^ .."You will notice," said the Governor, "that'no
where in these articles Is it said that 1 had any
knowledge of ; wrongdoing or participated knowingly in
anything wrong. As I don't know anything at all about
this matter I am not Â¦ undertaking to say anything for
Warden Aguirre. But I do know that some of the state
ments made there are absolutely false. . ,
"What does the paper say about me anyway? Oh, it
says that I slept between sheets paid for with State money
and ate frutt that was charged to the prison. Well, how
could I tell 'by the looks of the sheets. I am accustomed
to sleeping in sheets and I sometimes eat fruit. But real
ly, you. should know that , the Warden of the prison is re
quired tokeep up a house where he can entertain visitors.
The Governor Is properly: a guest of/ the Warden. The
Prison Directors frequently . stop there and distinguished
Visitors, from other States also accept the, hospitality of the
Warden. Is it not proper that he should have sheets,
towels, table cloths" and even night shirts? He is sup
posed. to, heep up a well appointed houSe" where he can
entertain" visitors, though some people seem to think he
should -live in a cell like the criminals. ~ I. pass. a good deal
of time at the house of the Warden at San Quentin and
now I am told that I have unconsciously been sleeping on
sheets that were' charged to the ; State. ; As 'a. matter >bf
fact, I believe that every item enumerated in ; that bill
for_$11213 was proparly charged -to-'the State; -Some, of
the items I don't "recognize, : but -those I , do seem quite
proper for the house of the Warden. .".'..:Â¦'â¢â¢ Â¦-.:'â¢"
"Here" I see that the paper harps on the
of convicts as clerks. in the departments. â¢ Don't you know
that it ; Is a common practice In all penal ' Institutions thus
to utilize the, services of 'trusties' who are qualified ?
"What- object :. would those convicts have in falsifying
or forging a bill? They may have made- mistakes. Such
things happen, in institutions having high salaried book
keepers;-why should they not in this case? ,
, "Aguirre has ! gone Â»to San Quentin and"'sent" ahead ot
him a telegraphed permission for a full investigation of
the records in h|s .offlc^,". when _â¢ he shall be present. It is
sail here that members of my family received the benefit
of these purchases.. I. suppose that anybody visiting in
the house of the .Warden Â¦ received proportionate benefit
depending on how long he slept or how much he ate. But
you will notice that the paper avoids saying that I know
ingly, derived- any benefit. Bear in mind that I am too
far away from. the scene, to be able to speak understarid
ingly on this subject, tor I don't" know, anything about it.
Yes, I slept at, the Warden's house and ate there,, so to
that extent I probably participated in these benefits. ;
Â¦ "I see that -paper says that my son asked Commissioner
Foley if the goods had arrived. Â¦ That refers to my little
lame boy. who "sometimes visits the Warden's house. -I
suppose if that HtUe boy were to accept an orange while
therelt would be' technically"' true that a member of my
family participated In' the benefits of the fruit stolen from
the public; stores. No, you will -see that Warden Aguirre
will be able | to - show that ! everything Is quite straight at
theprison and that. he nowise exceeded'his rights as War
den. That' man took hold of that prison when it was in
most deplorable condition and has put It in a shape that
makes it a* credit to the State." . - v

have been nothing said against ' the
charge, but if it had been altered then it
is entirely a different matter. I know
Warden Aguirre has often asked me
about dubious charges, whether or not
certain articles could be- charged to the
State. For instance, he asked ine if he
could not put a bottle of perfume in each
room and charge it to the State. I told
him it was ridiculous, to which he re
plied that he knew one of the Directors
liked cologne and he thought it would be
nice to have a bottle in each apartment.
A dozen other such questions were asked
me at different times. --.

A meeting of the boiler-makers -was held
at the union's headauarters to-day. The
members pledged themselves to refuse to
give any information and Ho refrain from
any disturbances. Other departments of
the machine shops are said to be In
sympathy with, the boiler-makers and the
men are said to have announced that, it
necessary, they would strike.
The grievance of the boiler-makers,
which caused tho strike, is over the dis
charge of a workman named Wilson, on*
of the oldest men, in point of service, in
that department of the Santa Fe. Wilson
was not actually discharged, but .was told,
he would be unless he agreed to go to
Selisman, Ariz., to work in accordance
with the company's wishes. On Saturday
"Wilson was transferred to Seligman. but
He refused to go. The company then toto
him he would be* discharged unless he
chose to go to Arizona. Wilson placed
the "matter' before â¢ the Boiler-makers'
Union and it was agreed that the union
would back up Wilson in his refusal.
About forty boiler-makers, with ap
prentices and the helpers, walked' out. In
former strikes the helpers and apprentices
remained at work.

tools and said he would not go back until

was no preliminary agitation, and, in fact,
only a few of the workmen, teally knew

NEW YORK, May 26.â The Presbyte
rian General Assembly at to-day's ses
sion chose Los Angeles, Cal., as the place
of next meeting.
The General Assembly acted adversely
on an overture from the presbytery of
Los Angeles # requesting that ministers
ccming from the South Presbyterian
Church be honorably retired with the
same privileges as if they had served al
ways with the church under the General
Assembly. The matter came before the
assembly in a report from the committee
en ministerial alliance. The Rev. William
6. Young, D.D., pastor of the Emanuel
Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, ad
vised-that the assembly act favorably on
the overture. In the West, he said, there
were many ministers, who had come
from the southern branch, and favorable
action by the assembly would help to
bring the two churches together.
The -Rev, Dt. Thomas Parry of WH
kineburg. Pa'., chairman of the committee,
took the opposite view. He said it would
cpen the door- fer ministers of other de
nominations to come to the Presbyterian
church and claim the same privileges as
the ministers who had served in the Gen
eral Assembly all'their lives. .
The Rev. Dr. ' Benjamin L. Agnew cf
Philadelphia*- corresponding secretary of
the board of ministerial relief, spoke in
the same -vein. He said the result of
granting the demand of toe presbytery of
Los Angeles would be that many of the
retired ministers who had always -been
with the Northern Presbyterian Church
wculd have their already scant allow
ances cut down.
"When the Civil War was closed," he
said, "we would have been willing to vote
for the union of .the two churches. But
1 am utterly opposed to holding out any
money consideration to bring them over.
They will hmve the same privileges as our
members tf they ccme over to the prin
ciples."
The Rev. Dr. James D. Mcllvain of Bal
timore said it would be unfortunate If the
overture did not receive favorable action.
"There is no difference with us between
the church North or South," he 6aid.
W"hen the question of selecting a meet
ing place was taken up the Rev. Dr.
Henry C. Minton, former moderator,
ir.ade- a ten-minute address in favor of
Los Angeles. He said Los Angeles had
worked two years to get the assembly
and should have it next year.
The Rev. Dr. Richard S. Holmes point
ed out that there was a great difference
between the mileage for Cleveland and
Los An seles. . Â¦Â¦ Â¦ :
"If you want to burden the member
ehlp for suph a big- Â£um as this difference
would be, let the money go to home mis
sions, or to' pay off the debt on Presby
terian buildings. We have no right to do
anything to favor a big corporation or
railroad."
At the moment when the moderator
called for a vote on the question a mem
ber of the assembly who refused to give
his name, but who was said to be an
elder from Cleveland, made the state
ment that a railroad had conducted a
lobby in favor of Los Angeles among the
commissioners. The moderator declared
the Cleveland elder out of order. Elder
Ernest E. Baker from Oakland, Cal., said
that the man referred to as a lobbyist
was a member of the assembly, who had
a perfect right to be on the floor of the
assembly. The vote was 2S7 for Los An
Â£e.'Â«s and 149 for Cleveland.
Soon after the assembly adjourned sine

The establishment of new lines or the
extension of existing service, if so large
as to double the present number of sail
ings, must, before being- carried out, be
submitted to a committee of the Joint
contracting parties.
The combine will not have the right to
prevent such extension, however, except
In the event of such party desiring to ef
fect such extension or establishment of
new lines. It is bound to give the other
the option of participating to the extent
of one-third. This provision does not af
fect coastal . or similar minor, services.
The North Atlantic cabin passenger
traffic of both parties is to be regulated

vides further for the arrangements of dif
ferences and it becomes inoperative in the
event of war between the United States

or the United States and Great Britain.
The combination agrees to leave to the
Hamburg-American line its services from
New York to East Asia and New York to
the West Indies.
BERLIN, May 26.â The directors of the
Hamburg-American line have issued a cir
cular divulging the terms of the agree
ment arrived at between the Morgan ship
ping combine and the Hamburg-American
and the North German Lloyd lines. The
two German companies undertake to pay
the combine an annual sum equal to a
dividend on shares amounting to at least
20,000,000 marks. This provision was
agreed upon when the capital of the Ger
man lines was 80,000,000 marks each and
in the event of an increase in the capital,
a contingency which . meanwhile has
arisen, the combine reserves the right of
increasing the annual sum accruing to it
to an amount equaling dividends of 2o per
cent of -the capital stock. The syndicate.,
in return, pledges Itself to pay the-Ger
mans 6 per cent on a corresponding
amount of capital, and not to send any
ships to a German portr without the con
sent of the German companies. The lat
ter are bound to limit 'their traffic from
British ports. â¢ They can,..however,..con
tinue the existing service. The Germans
are not precluded from including in their
ports of call hereafter British ports from
Which the combine does not run services,
nor from running their South American,
Mexican and West Indian services from
British ports, even though the -combine
utilizes the same ports. The combine,
on the "other hand, undertakes to allow
two ships weekly In each direction to
touch at French ports. The Germans
are debarred from touching at Belgian
ports with ships running to and from
North America and agree not to touch at
English ports exceeding seventy-five times
for each company, each way,-, making an
aggregate of 300 calls. The Germans are
free to increase their sailings from
French ports, in which case the combine
is entitled to an increase, proportionately.
The warrant has not been served, the
doctor having, departed for San Fran

WILKESBARRB, May 26.â It is still
a matter of conjecture whether the mines
in the anthracite region will be complete-,
ly shut down next. Monday, when - the
order issued by the executive boards of
the United Mine Workers, governing the
hours of labor and wages to be paid en
gineers, firemen and pump runners will
go into effect. The operators declare they
will have all the help necessary to keep
the pumps and engines in running order.
The United Mine Workers and the offi
cers of the Stationary Firemen's Associa
tion, on the other hand, assert that un
less the. coal companies grant the de
mands made upon them the great bulk
of the engineers, firemen and pumpmen
will quit work. â¢
Many of the engineers do not like the
predicament they are in. If they quit
work they may never be reinstated, while
if they remain at their posts and . the
miners should win their strike they would
probably s find that things would not be
so pleasant for them at the collieries in
the future. â¢
At a largely attended meeting in this
city to-night a committee of United Mine
Workers reported that they had called
upon many engineers during the day and
that nearly all had given their, word that
they would join the other strikers next
Monday unjess the demand for a shorter
workday was granted. . i, '

Adjutant General Corb!n has received
the following cablegram from Captain J.
Gallagher, commissary department, dated
St. Vincent, May 24:
"The area of devastation on St. Vincent
Is about twelve square miles in the north
ern extremity. The population of this
area was about 8000, of which 1600 lost
their lives, the remainder escaping by
flight to Kingstown and other places. It
was no such overwhelming catastrophe as"
at St. Pierre, yet. more people are to be
sustained by the public because many es
caped. Outside of the area devastated no
great damage waa <lone, but the people
are very apprehensive. This condition will
not abate until the volcano, which is still
active, subsides. A second eruption oc
curred May IS, but no additional damage
was done. Supplies of all kinds from the
Dixie were most gratefully received, and
will, with what was on hand, provide for
the present population for three months.
Lumber for rebuilding is asked. Nothinar
is known of any disturbance outside of
St. Vincent and Martinique. Now that
the emergency has been met I would ad
vise sending supplies gradually, and only
after inquiry as to actual .. needs, as a
great quantity sent at once might prove
more embarrassing than beneficial. ThÂ©
stores on the Dixie were well selected."
Secretary Moody also received the fol
lowing cablegram from Captain Berry of
the Dixie, dated St. Lucia. May 26:
"The Dixie is discharging the remainder
of her stores at Kingstown, where they are
most needed. The provisions now on hand
will last several months. Lumber for
houses is needed. The volcano is_actlve.
but no additional damage. Care of the res
cued and injured, approximately SO0O, well
in hand by the local authorities."
A telegram was received anounclng the

overwhelmed the city of which it was a
suburb. Coasting along the west side of
the Island, from its head toward Fort de

that Pelee had wrought, and it had sunk
so deep into .their memory that so long

1 words seemed so inadequate to describe it
âthat it was- more by look than speech
that the men gathered on the deck -of
the Luckenbach sought to convey to one
another their impressions of the scene as
it passed before their eyes. But when
the whitened, crumbling ruins of St.
Pierre had been passed, Carbet, still sur

of it. In a flash it came to them all
how near the beautiful city had been to
safety, how short a distance its inhabi

beyond the limits of the mountain's

It Is not known, and perhaps never will

had nothing, to do -with the destruction
that -was caused. : The, theory is, and one
that is everywhere borne out by evidence,
that a 'crevice was opened In the side of
the volcano nearest the city, and that
: through 'this 'vent Issued* a gas that was
borne by a breeze straight over St. Pierre.
The lines of demarkation of this gaseous
river, plain- as though ."they .had- been
drawn -by a ruler, lay down the slope,
narrowing at the mountain's top to open
fan-shaped as ' it neared the ocean, and
including every section of the doomed city
within its. deadly radius. Some idea of
the intense heat engendered may be had
from the fact that the wroughtiron pipes

400 feet . distant from any building have
been found fused and twisted out of all

BURIED DEEP BY LAVA.
With little difficulty a landing was ef
fected on the Marina, directly In front of
the ruin of the large rum. warehouse of
Lassar Frocs. The wharves In front were
littered with an Inextricable tangle of
rum casks, barrel hoops a^nd staves, heavy
Iron anchor chains, piles of conch shells
and other maritime debris. The heavy
masonry walls of the building, falling out
ward, but up to the second story above
the ground, the thick stone walls of the
front had stood, though seamed and tot
tering. Here. In the main doorway, at the
very threshold of the place where he had
toiled. wa6 seen the first mute relic of
human tragedyâ a negro. Broadshouldered
and strong, he had been a stevedore or
warehouse porter probably. The stone
arch of the doorway had saved him from
being crushed under the falling walls and
the masonry had shielded the body
partly from the fire.
Soon living beings were seen scrambling
(down to the shore from amid the ruins.
They were a party of negro looters. The
approach of the Call-Herald steamer had
Interrupted them at their work and they
scurried down to the beach and tumbled
into a long dory which had lain hidden
behind a half-burned bulkhead. Closer
Inspection of their craft during a brief
parley while the Call-Herald's boat wan
alongside, showed that the other craft
was well filled with silver tableware,
blackened and much of It fused with.sil

candelabra, pieces of broken pottery and
mantel ornaments and detached pieces of
iron and copper machinery. All were
coated with the gray dust that cave to

the deathlike stillness was broken by the
crackling of a coal yard fire. No word

In the shadow of such a. horror all were

In other parts of the city not even a

Something of scandal has been attach

chalice of the cathedral was rescued. In
THE CATHBDBAL CHALICE.
From this point the party, with difficul
ties Increasing at every step, pushed far
ther up the steep toward the heart of the
town, into Victor Hugo street. Progress
here was made rather by climbing than
by walking. Through Victor Hugo street
we penetrated to what had been the Cath
edral de Moulloce. Had it been hammered
for a fortnight under the guns of a fleet
of battleships its ruin could hardly have
.been more complete. When Pickett on
the last day of Gettysburg hurled his le
gions in the final assault upon Hancock's
second corps It Was said that over the
ground traversed by that great charge
from Seminary Ridge to the point held
by Webb's Philadelphia brigade a man
might have walked literally upon the bod
ies of the slain. In the Place de Moulloce

ing the cathedral one could hardly see to
pick his way to escape walking upon the
bodies of the dead. It was no exaggera
tion when Consul. Ayrne of Guadeloupe
Bald that the streets of St. Pierre were
paved with the corpses of her citizens.
Seme crude effort there had been made to
destroy by fire the grewsome relics spared
by the original cataclysm, but. the work
had been done all too ineffectiveyl. Fagots
of driftwood piled around and above
heaps of the slain had been fired by ne
groes employed for that purpose, but the
work of cremating was only partly ac
complished. From a sanitary point > of
view it is fortunate for Martinique that
the vast majority of those who died when
her chief city was annihilated are burled
so deep as to need no better sepulcher.

pipe, the nozzle . of which projected
through the shattered wall of a private
dwelling. From it the water, in pure crys

the masses of ashes and cementllke pow
der beneath into a sticky paste. St.
Pierre's streets, with their trickling rivu
lets of mountain water, had been the
pride of hej- citizens. Through all the
blast of fire the remnant . of her water
system', at least, had survived. One of
the party had approached the trickling
water to lave from his hands and face
the choking accumulation of dust. As he
did so he stepped back and paused. Di

huddled the grizzled remnants of a dead

had engaged in looting. In Fort de

a possible military court of inquiry to In
vestigate Captain Dubury's action at the
request of French authorities of the
colony. .
Though many ghouls have already
prowled through the catacomba of tho
ruined city, St. Pierre presents a profit
able field for the would-be looter. It
would have been easy for any member
of the Herald-Call party during the hours
while they were tramping over the en
tombed town to have tilled baskets with
sliver spoons, coins, ear-rings, finger

that possible. - They were busily at work

After remarks by Hoar upon the con
stitutional feature the matter went over.
Culberson of Texas presented and had
read an account of a lynching in Kansas,
saying that he wanted it shown that the
crime of lynching was confined to no
State or section. He hoped that the New
Hampshire Senator would not single out
his State when he wanted to bring such
matters before the Senate.
"There can be objection," said Bailey,
"to a report from the Judiciary Commit
tee on the subject, because I am sure
there can be but one conclusion reached
by that committee. But if in the course
of its investigations it should undertake
to . parade before the country all the
lynchings and burnings that have oc
curred in any section over a nameless of
fense, and all the murders of women and
children and all the abductions -which
have occurred in other sections of the
country, the only result. It seems to me,
would be to make us think less of our
selves as a people and as a nation, and I
have little disposition to Indulge in that
pastime myself."
WASHINGTON, May 26.â In the Senate
to-day Gallinger of New Hampshire of
fered a resolution providing that the
Judiciary Commttee of the Senate should
make an Investigation Into the subject of
lynchings In the United States with the
view of ascertaining If there Is any rem
edy for them.
Gallinger said he Introduced the resolu
tion in full view of the fact that he might
be charged with precipitating a sectional
controversy, but nothing was further
from his thoughts. He said lynchings
were not confined to the South. Horrible
cases had occurred In the North, and
white men as well as blacks had been the
victims. During the past ten years 26^5
lynchings had occurred in the Lmtted
States. If the strong arm of the law could
prevent such occurrences he deemed it
wise to do so. He read the account or
the negro burning in Texas a few days
ago. He said history did not furnish a
more fiendish Instance of mob wrath, and
Fox's "Book of Martyrs" was tame in
comparison. The whole wretched busi
ness, he said, was a disgrace to American
manhood, in the light of which the al
leged atrocities in the Philippines paled
into Insignificance. The Spanish inquisi
tion did not furnish a case exceeding that
one In inhumanity. He apprehended that
it would be said that the Federal Govern
ment was powerless and that the States
had exclusive jurisdiction. If so the
American people desired to know it. '
Bailey of Texas said he had no Idea of
being drawn Into any sectional controver
sy by the Senator from New Hampshire,
and he would be willing to have the peo
ple judge the men who perpetrated such
outrages. ! He desired, however, to dis
cuss the question whether the Govern
ment had the right to go Into the several
States and take charge of the peace* and
good order. He asked therefore that the
resolution go over.

If this convention should be adopted not only
would delay attend the progress of the canal,
but the United States would assume obligations
to the world that it would be impossible to
keep and relations with Colombia that will de
prive the canal of all valuo to the United
States and will make It a cause of Irritation
that must Involve the most serious conse
quence:.
Colombia Is anxious to get rid of the Pan
ama Canal Company without giving offense to
France, so that she can seize and possess all
the plant of the canal company, all the lands
and houses It owns In Panama, including tha
great hospital, the machine shops and wharvoj
at Colon, all the vast machinery in use by tha
Panama Canal Company, the hospitals and
other houses, the palace built for De Lssseps
and his sons and become the owner of It all.
along with the Panama Railroad Company.
TJie report adds:
It is charged that Colombia does not
by her protocol propose fro sell us tha
Panama canal and railroad property free
of all existing claims, concessions ar.d
incumbrances, but leaves us to work out
a title with the Panama Company.
The report discusses at length the pro
tocols with Colombia and Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, and It states incidentally that
former Colombian Minister Silva was in
vited to appear before tbe committee, but
declined to do so. Of the agreements with
Costa Rica and Nicaragua it is said that
"they are definite and complete as to ths
character and scope of the rights they
have agreed to concede to the United
States." and it is argued that if they are
ratified nothing will be left to do but to
carry the agreement into effect.
Colombia, on the other hand, is charged
with playing for delay, and it is stated
that "to hold Colombia to her present
offer It Is necessary, under article $7, that
ratifications shall be exchanged within
eight months of its date, and the practi
cal impossibility of concluding all tha
necessary arrangements provided for \n
her proposition within eight moatha
that her most earnest purpose is to
cause delay."
WASHINGTON, May 26.â Senator Mor
gan from the Committee on Isthmian
Canals to-day submitted to the Senate the
adverse report of that committee on Sen
ator Hoar's bill placing: the selection of a
route for an isthmian canal In the hands
of the President. The committee opposed
the bill on the ground that it makes no
provision for further exploration of routes
i and leaves the President to make a selec
tion on the statement of facts already
ascertained. It la contended that "how
ever safely the country may rely on tha
wisdom and just discretion of the execu
â¢tlve, the policy Is not wise nor safe as a
rule of government."

NEW YORK, May 26.â The French bat
tleship Gaulois, which brought the French
mission to attend the unveiling of the
Rochambeau monument at Washington,
arrived here to-day from Annapolis. The
United States battleships Kearsarge. and
Alabama and the cruiser Olympla, which
were accompanying the Gaulois, arrived
thirty minutes later. ,
The Gaulois exchanged salutes with the
fort on Governors Island as she steamed
up North River to an anchorage off
Thirty-fourth street. Shortly after reach-
Ing there at 1 o'clock a party of French
visitors from the battleship boarded the
United States dispatch boat Dolphin and
went to West Point.
Mayor Lowe issued the following proc
lamation to-day:
The party spent two hours driving
through the park on the American side
and across the bridge - to the Canadian
side. â¢ At Table Rock they left their car
riages and walked about for a half-hour.
They then returned directly to the special
train and took luncheon in the dining
car. Â¦ At 1:15 two special cars of the
Niagara Gorge Railroad were brought up
to the . station, and nearly every member
of the party occupied them for a Journey
through the picturesque gorge.
> ,The first atop was made at the whirl
pool: rapids. A quick run was made to
Lewlston and across the new bridge into
British territory again. The military men
were interested in the details of the bat
tlo of Queenston Heights, which was re
lated to them during a stop at the monu
ment which marks the spot where the
British general. Brock, fell.
The cars then proceeded slowly along
the Canadian side of the gorge on the
Canadian Scenic Railroad 1 to the. upper
steel bridge, crossed the bridge and ar
rived at this station at 3:45.
- Just before the departure of the train
for the East a bevy of girls dressed in
white presented to Countess de Rocham
beau a large bouquet of flowers sent by
the sisters and pupils of the Sisters of
Mercy Convent. â¢
, The Count and Countess de Rocham
beau came to the rear platform of the
last car as the train departed and re
mained there until the train disappeared.
NIAGARA FALLS/ N. Y. f May 26.â The
members. of the French .mission who par
ticipated j-in the -ceremonies incident to
the unveiling of the statue of Count de
Rochambeau at arrived at
Niagara Falls this morning. Besides the
members of the" mission and the families
of Lafayette and Rochambeau there were
In: the" party . â¢ Embassador Cambon,
Madame Cambon, members of the staff
of the French embassy and the Presi
dent's commission.
Fitzsimmons began light training at
Skaggs yesterday. He took a Jog over the
hills in the morning, and In the afternoon
he worked in the gymnasium that has
been fitted up for his benefit.
George Gardner, the middle-weight box
er, is very sore on Jack Root. Gardner
says that Root is too timid to meet him
in a finish fight. George claims that he
can fight better when the bout is for an
unlimited number of rounds. Since Root
declines to meet him in Nevada on July 4
Gardner is willing to take on "Kid" Mc-
Coy. Negotiations are now pending for
the match.
Jeffries intended leaving yesterday for
Harbin Springs, but missed his train. He
will make another try this morning. Joe
Kennedy will very likely join him at the
â¢prings in a few days. Bob Armstrong Is
in demand. Fitz wants him and Jeff
thinks he has first call on his services.
Neither man has succeeded in reaching
the dusky pugilist.
Jeffries said yesterday that If he defeats
Fitzsimmons he will take on Jim Corbett
in September. Harry Corbett broached the
eubject to Jeffries last Sunday night. Jeff
expressed his willingness to meet Corbett
and Harry immediately notified his
brother.
The two men are in eplendid shape.
They have been in training for the last
three weeks and are anxiously waiting
for the sound of the gong that will send
them together. Eddie Smith of Oakland
is to referee the contest.
Seats for the Britt-Lavigne contest,
which will be brought off In Woodward's
Pavilion next Thursday night under the
auspices of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, will open at Corbett's this morning.
Manager Alec Greggalns has received nu
merous orders from the country from
sporting men, and local ring-goers have
left requests for choice locations. As
usual, tbe Olympic Club will send a big
delegation to the ringside. Brltt always
fights under the colors of the local club.
The organization is strictly an amateur
one, but Brltt has proven himself Buch a
fair boxer that he was elected a member
â¢without a dissenting vote.
The betting on the coming contest is 10
to 9. with Britt on the long end. As yet
the wagering is light, but will grow heav
ier as the hour of the contest draws near.
Lavlgne has many friends in this city.
They believe that with his ability to with
stand punishment and deliver hard blows
he will make Jimmy stop before half the
journey Is traveled.

A. H. Baldwin and A. B. Glidden of
Aberdeen were returning last week from
a timber cruise in the Hoh River coun
try. Losing their trail they wandered
about to regain it. They reached a small
open spot among tall timber where the
odor of oil was so strong that they knew
an oil flow must exist somewhere. Their
Eearch revealed an immense oil well in
which a sticky mass rose at times far
above the surface and spread out over
the top of the ground. It would then
elowly sink back into the aperture like a
geyser that had Just ceased to spout. The
well was surrounded by large rocks.
Securing a pole they poked it Into the
mass of oil for twelve feet without strik
ing anything. Suddenly . the pole was
wrenched from their grasp and forced
Into the air by an enormous stream of oil
which rose to a height of twenty feet
and then fell back to the hole with a
loud sound-
TACOMA, May 26.â Though wells -have

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 26.â
Five hundred spectators sat through two
long hours of most ragged baseball play
ing this morning under the blistering rays
of the sun to watch the Stanford faculty
nine defeat the senior class aggregation
by the score of 25 to 13. Never has the
college witnessed such a listless, unexcit
ing game between the professors and the
graduating students. The usual clamor
and sideline Joshing were not In evidence,
and the seniors appeared in simple base
ball array instead of fancy costumes, as
has been the custom of preceding classes.
The students had planned to don Greek
costumes similar to those worn bv the
chorus In the Greek play "Antigone," but
through some mistake the flowing robes
failed to arrive, hence a shabby lot of
wornout baseball suits were substituted.
Early in the game the seniors led by a
Bcore of 3 to 1, and their classmates on
the sidelines foresaw the possibility of a
breaking of the series of faculty victories
curing the past few years. They were
doomed to disappointment, however, for
Hit professors "took a brace" and began
to tap the ball at will all over the field, I
ecoring everything from singles to a home
run by Allin. Professor Burt Estes How
ard, the faculty twirler, pitched a game
that would have done credit to his record
as a varsity ball player in his undergrad
uate days. He was good at the bat as
well, as were most of the faculty nine.
Professors Searles and Starbuck headed
the list with four hits each.
For the seniors stars were not notice
able, but Hinman, Hamilton and Ross
chowed up most favorably.
Camera fiends, as usual, thronged the
diamond, interest centering around Presi
dent Jordan as the object of their snap
shots. The doctor's picture was taken
from rear, front and side views, on first
base and at the bat. President Hinman
of the senior class, who held down the
second bag, also came in- for attention
from the photographers. I

ORGANIZING A BANKâ Reader. Ver
ona, Cal. The organization of a bank un
der'a general law. State or national, Is a
simple matter. Articles of association ara
drawn up In accordance with the statute
of the State or the act of Congress. In
either, the form Is nearly always pre
scribed. These articles recite: ; The title
of the proposed, bank; the amount of It3
capital stock, the number of shares into
which it is divided and the amount of
each. Usually these articles . contain the
names of the first directors and are
signed by them, the act of sub
scription including their election. Each
subscriber to the capital stock places op
posite his name the number of shares ha
desires. When the capital stock Is all
taken up a certificate of organization
must be filed with the Secretary of State,
and a certified copy thereof with the
Clerk or Recorder of the county in which
the bank is located. Generally a publica
tion of the articles of association is made
necessary by State law.
PICKETT AT GETTYSBURGâ J. W.
L., Tuttletown, Cal. In an article en
titled "Battles and Leaders of the Civil
War" contributed by E. Porter Alexander,
brigadier general, C. S. A., who on the
last day of the battle of Gettysburg was
of Longstreet's reserve artillery in com
mand of a battalion of twenty-six guns,
says among other things: "And that Gen
eral Longstreet might know my intention
I wrote him only this: 'General: When
our artillery fire is at its best. I shall or
der Pickett to charge." " Further In hia
narrative he has: "Then I wrote to Pick
ett: 'If you are coming at all, you must
come at once, or I cannot give you proper
support.'" In another (part he says of
Lcngstreet and Pickett: "Pickett saluted
and said, 'I am going to move forward,
sir,' galloped off to his division and Im
mediately put It in motion." Longstreet
corroborates this. So it appears that
Pickett was with his division in its mem
orable charge.

The United States courts have decided that people

There a good many reasons of course why the'
Kaiser should wish to give us a statue of Frederick

advised his brother to give us one just to show us

At the recent "Oregon day" at the Charlest6n ex
position, the orator of the occasion had hardly 100
persons in his audience, and it is recalled that at
the Omaha exposition "Massachusetts day" was
about as slimly attended, though the Governor of
Massachusetts was there. From those facts the
Springfield Republican draws the conclusion
that the people are tired of expositions. It would
teem, however, more logical to conclude that
the people are tired of State days and State orators.
An exposition will pay if there be more exhibits and
less talking than Charleston .and Omaha put up.

The offenses have become so frequent and have
occurred in such widely scattered localities as to ren
der it certain that State law is comparatively power
less to deal with the offenders and bring them to jus
tice. We have just had an example of the* failure of
justice in Modoc County, in this State, so we need
not taunt other States with the inefficiency" of their,
laws. The crime has, in fact, been perpetrated North
and South arid East and WeitL and in nearly sv Â«Â»
The issue should not be converted into a question
of partisanship' nor of sections. There will be of
course some difficulty experienced in trying to avoid
the latter by reason of the greater frequency of lynch
ing in the South than elsewhere. The Southern peo
ple are extremely sensitive on the subject. That much
was shown at the' time Senator Gallinger submitted his
resolution, for after- he had read an account of the
latest lynching outrage in Texas Senator Culberson
of that State rose and read an account of a similar
outrage in Kansas as an' evidence that the crime' is
not confined to the South. Of course that phase of
the issue should not come into the discussion at all.
It is not a question where lynchings are most fre
quent, but what can be done to punish those who com
mit them and put an end to those hideous torturings
and burnings of. human beings by mobs which are
becoming so appallingly common.
While it is not apparent what the Federal Govern
ment can do toward the suppression of what has now
become one of the most portentous evils of the coun
try, Senator Gallinger's resolution will none the less
be worthy of adoption. The whole subject should be
investigated thoroughly, and if it be possible to find
a remedy it should be promptly provided. More than
that. If no certain remedy can be found by the Ju
diciary Committee it should do the best it can in
the premises and report some. remedial act that has a
chance at least of standing 'the test of the Supreme
Court.
Â£> ENATOR GALLINGER has submitted a reso-
lution instructing the Judiciary Committee of
the Senate to make an. investigation into the
subject of lynching in the United States, with a view
to ascertaining if there be any remedy for the of
fense. . Â¦
LAW AND THE LYNCHERS.
The duty of registration is imperative. It is im
posed upon every citizen. An especial responsibil-.
ity rests upon good citizens. Unless that class of
voters register the bosses will have their way at the
polls.. The duty should be attended to at once. Do
not wait until after the holidays. Register, now.
There is to be a complete new registration this
year. Every citizen. must register or forfeit his right
to vote. r If the registration be attended to now it
can be done readily and quickly. .If it be postponed
until the rush of belated ones throng the registration
office it will be more or less annoying and will en
tail a loss of time in waiting at the office.
The campaign is not only to be an Important one',
as all campaigns are in this country,, but it is also to
be a close one. The Democratic party, divided as it
is on well nigh every, issue before the country, is
united in the desire to carry the election and get pos
session of the offices. It is what is' known- as an'
off year, and. in such years opposition parties have"
always been dangerous. Should any considerable*,
number of Republicans fail to register we, may lose'
one or perhaps more Congressmen. Moreover State
politics in California has always been uncertain. Re
publican Governors have alternated in office/with
Democratic Governors for a long time past. The Re
publican party can afford to take no chances this',
year. :. ; ;. ' ; Â¦ ' , . ';'; ,. ':'Â¦.. ' }:;'(
AT the meeting of the Republican % State
Central Committee on Saturday resolutions
were adopted calling attention to the delay of

urge registration at once.. The resolutions are timely
and- pertinent. It is to be hoped they will be acted
upon. - r

a resident of Oakland and a director ' of
this' Berkeley Bank of. Savings and Cen
tral Bank of Oakland. . ,
The* bride was charming In an elegant
gown of white tulle over silk. The bridal
veil of white tulle was caught in the hair
with orange blossoms. The bouquet was
of white orchids. The maid of honor was
handsomely attired in -pink mousaellne
de soie over silk and carried white roses.
The little flower girls were daintily
gowned in pink silk and carried baskets
of baby roses of the same color.
AT a pretty home wedding yester
day "at high noon Miss Gertrude
Goewey became the "bride of MrP
John "Weston Havens. The bride's
home, 306 Page street, was .hand
somely decorated. The color scheme was
pink and white. Pink carnations pre
dominated in the drawing rooms and the
dining-room was fragrant with orange
blossoms. Foliage was. effectively inter
spersed with the flowers. The bow win
dow, where the bridal party stood, was
converted into a bower of roses. The
bride was attended by Miss Kate Dillon,
maid of honor, and Miss Florence "Wool
sey and Miss Elizabeth Brice, flower
girls. Mr. Frank B. Goewey, the bride's
brother, was best man. j Rev. Bradford
Leavitt performed the ceremony.
In fact, we are just discovering California. These
merchant tours are voyages of discovery. Every tour
ist js a Columbus. Every locality they visit is a
Land of Promise, full of corn and wine and flowing
with milk and honey, with a potential wealth un
equaled by any other part of the earth. Tulare is
simply one part of the charming color that makes the
whole sumptuous kaleidoscope.
The almonds and walnuts marketed from London
are shipped from France and Spain. Here we pro
duce them of better quality in counties that are in
sight from Telegraph Hill. London's olive oil and
pickled oiives come from the edges of the Mediter
ranean. The oil she exports is largely adulterated.
Some of it cushioned the ribs of Iowa hogs, some
grew in our Southern cotton fields, and some is sup
plied by the peanut crop of North Carolina.; Here
the pure oil grows in vast orchards from San Diego
to Shasta. The English mint turns into sovereigns
gold that is imported from South Africa, Australia
and Alaska. The San Francisco Mint works the
largest coinage in the world, and the Pactolean
stream has its source in our own mountains.
Every article of necessity and luxury that is given
value by human desire is produced right here, and
under intensive methods its production can'be in
creased tci meet the world's demand.
The wine handled on the London docks comes
from Spain, Portugal, France and Germany. Its
equal in quality and its superior in purity is
produced within a few hours' ride of our ware
houses. In volume its production can be easily
made to equal the aggregate of the wine
countries of Europe. The prunes, raisins, citrus
fruits and fruit products distributed from "London
are harvested all the way from the Levant to Valen
cia. A San Francisco merchant can leave his store at
the close of the day's business, spend the evening and
the morning in the orchards and vineyards and be
back at his desk at the opening of business next day.
As The Call has often pointed out, in the produc
tive capacity of California San Francisco has a per
manent and increasing resource which alone is suffi
cient to make this one. of the most important cities
in the world. The volume of trade which this State
can supply in articles of commerce that are univer
sally desirable can make San Francisco the equal of
London as a distributing point for those articles.
THE second party of business men from this city
to visit Tulare County received and confirmed
the impression made upon the tourists of three
weeks ago. Not only are these tours delightful social
experiences, but they are of the highest practical im
portance to the production of the State a.nd the busi
ness of San Francisco.

SOCIETY BELLE OF THIS CITY
AND THE MAN WHO CLAIMED
HER AS HIS BRIDE.
Municipal evolution in the United States is, in fact,
going forward with juch rapidity, and is accompanied
by such a universal demand for more beautiful as well
as more prosperous cities, that railway officials must
sooner or later conform to. public desire and make
railway stations attractive, commodious and noble.
The time when the larger cities of the country were
content with ramshackle structures for passenger sta
tions has passed away. San Francisco in all serious
ness should enter herself as a rival of Buffalo, Cleve
land and Kansas City, not as to which has the worse
station, but as to which can mosf speedily obtain a
better one. \"<
The three cities named are now working diligently
for better depot accommodations. The insufficiency
of. the Buffalo station was made conspicuous during
the exposition last year, and ever since there has been
a strong movement in the direction of a better one.
At Kansas City it is reported there is a "secret com
mittee" at work trying to bring the various railroads
that center in the city to an agreement to construct
a, grand union depot equal to the needs of, the pub
lic. Cleveland has larger plans than either, of the
others. It is stated that her citizens are seeking to
have a new station constructed as one of a group of
stately buildings, which are to line a broad, open park
extending from the lake front to the Jieart of the city.
A short time ago a dispatch from New York an
nounced that as a result of President Harriman's in
vestigations the Southern Pacific Company would ex
pend upward of $75,006,000 in improvements. Otft of
that expenditure something "should De- provided for a
proper station in this city. ' It might even be. possible
for the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific to combine
for a union depot, since it seems certain that such,
a depot will be required by the development of the
city and the roads themselves before- many years are
over.
The discussion in' the East has arisen out of a wide
spread demand in that section for better accommo
dations for passengers and the general public" at rail
way stations. Our railway system is far superior to
any other in the world, but it lags behind many coun
tries in the arrangements made for the comfort of
passengers at the stations where they depart or ar
rive. In fact, the American railway carries a passen
ger across deserts or wildernesses it may be in a
palace car, but lands him in a shanty when he reaches
a city of metropolitan pretensions.
If the St. Louis exposition will'offer as a premium
a grand passenger depot to the large city in the
United States" which has the greatest need of it our
people would at once get up: a. series of exhibits
showing the Southern Pacific' station in this city,
with a sanguine' expectation, of not only winning the
prize but distancing competitors., . \
FROM our Eastern exchanges we learn that a
discussion is how going on as to .whether Buf
falo, Cleveland o- Kansa's City has the worst ;
railway passenger depot among the, larger cities of
the Union and is in most need of a new one. The.
controversy is interesting, and San Francisco would
like to enter as a contestant. . . Â¦â¢ Â¦ . r
QUESTION OF STATIONS. \
The unspeakable wretch who is in jail at Castroville
on a charge of matricide seems to . be one of those
horrid forms which 1 eap into civilization to tell man
of his fearful ancestry and? of ages long dead. The
beast should belput out of the world as soon"as pos
sible. '".'.. ' .
From this and other evidences it is plain that the
civil government is between two fires. On one side
are the angered and revolutionary natives in armed
revolt, and on the other the civilian Americans * in
moral revolt. If there be any wisdom to spare any
where, it may be used beneficially in the Philippines.
The situation is made worse and more threatening
of permanent trouble by the fact that civilian Ameri
cans in the islands join the native victims of oppres
sion in denouncing the civil government which is ad
ministered on the lines of martial law. In the edi
torial for which the editor of Freedom is under arrest
it was said: "The long and short of it is that Amer
icans will not stand for arbitrary government, espe
cially when evidences of carpet : bagging and rumors
of graft are too thick to be pleasant. If civil govern
ment is to be a success in the Philippines there must
be a radical departure and a listening to reason and
the desires of the people. It would seem in the mat
ter of industrial taxation,- the currency and many
others the commission has done exactly the opposite
of what was desired by the majority of the interests
in the islands."
From the proofs offered by Senor Valdez and the
editor of Freedom it seems perfectly plain that the
Filipinos who have been put in authority by the com
mission use these cruel and extreme statutes for the
purpose of oppressing, blackmailing and robbing their
own countrymen. The same system prevailed under
Spanish rule and was the cause of much of the hatred
of Spain. We do not think that the commission has
intended any such result, but that is the effect of the
severe laws it has put in operation. For this reason
American rule seems to be only a change of men and
not of methods.
For N reprinting Mr. Adamson's letter and making
very temperate comment upon it the American editor
of Freedom was arrested by the commission and
charged with "scurrilous libel and sedition," to be
tried under Spanish? law! Senator. Hoar has declared
the commission's statute of treason and sedition to be
the crudest and most unjust law ever enacted by
man. It seems to be carrying into civil government
all of the severities of martial law.
The sedition law, under Which he was arrested, is
an American statute, promulgated by the Philippine
Commission, but Valdez and the other editors were
tried in courts of first instance under the forms of
Spanish law. Valdez offered to prove his charges,
and no doubt was able to do so, but under Spanish
law the^ rule is that the greater the truth the greater
the libel. This is the opposite of the law of libel in
this country. Americans in the islands object to
being tried by Spanish criminal law for alleged vio
lation of an American statute. They object to the
sedition section of the commission's code because
it is an anomaly 'in civil government.
Senor Valdez published proofs of . equally grave
charges against one of the^ native members of the
commission, Senor Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera, and
was arrested, imprisoned and fined 800 pesos.
Mr. Sidney Adamson, 'in a communication to Les
lie's Weekly, said that "the civil commission,
through its ex-insurgent office-holders and by its
continual disregard for the records of natives ob
tained during the military rule of the islands, has, in
its distribution ' of offices, constituted a protectorate
over a set of men who should be in jail or deported."
This statement was reprinted in Freedom, an
American newspaper published in Manila, and-de
tails and specifications in proof were printed in that
journal and in a Filipino paper at Miau, of which
Senor Valdez is the editor. These proofs were
specific. They showed among other things that Tec
sop, presidente of San Pablo, arrested a large number
of rich Fnipinos, charging them with complicity
with the insurrectos. After they had been imprisoned
and their lives put in peril under the statute of trea
son provided by the Philippine Commission, he pro
cured their release, one at a time. After all were free
it was proved that he made them pay him a large sum
of money for releasing them. Of course it was for
the purpose of blackmailing them that they were ar
rested.
SOME editors of newspapersJn the Philippines
have been fined and imprisoned under the se
, dition laws promulgated by authority of the
United States, through the Philippine Commission.
MANILA GOVERNMENT.
A few days ago we directed attention to a bill now
before providing that where a State does
not give adequate protection to a citizen the' Federal
Government might > interfere under the: fourteenth
amendment and punish, any and all persons convicted
of taking part in the mob that killed a citizen. The
constitutionality of the bill is doubtful, but it at least
offers a suggestion of a way to put an end to the
wrong. Perhaps the Judiciary Committee of 'the
Senate can devise a better way. One thing is certain
âsomething." will have to be done. Lynch law has
become a horrible barbarism. It threatens a relapse
to savagery and.it must be suppressed by some form
of law or the law itself 'will lose the respect of the,
people.
instance has gone unpunished. It appears, then, that
the States cannot effectively grapple with the wrong.

J. Courtenay Bennett, the British Con
sul General, through F. W. Everton of
the Sailors' Institute, has Instituted
criminal . proceedings against Thomas
Murray and Harry Hansen, two sailors'
boarding-house keepers, for violating sec
tion 644 of the Penal Code by enticing
bailors from the British ship Stronsa,
which is a misdemeanor. The complaint
was sworn to by Everton before Judge
Cubaniss yesterday. He was accompanied
by the Consul General.
The ship arrived from Glasgow, Scot
land, Sunday and it is alleged that Mur
ray and Hansen and other boarding
house keepers rowed out to the vessel,
boarded her and treated the men in the
forecastle to whi3key and rum. The men
were promised good positions on coast
ing vessels if they would desert the ship.
Eight of them left with Murray and
Kansen and they were distributed among
the different boarding-houses on' the
front.
- Yesterday E. U. Simonsen, one of the
deserters, called at the office of the Brit
ish Consul General to be reshipped. Cap^
tain Jones of the Stronsa happened to be
in the . office at the time and recognized
Simonsen as one of his men. He asked
for an explanation and Simonsen told
about what had happened on board the
vessel on Sunday. It was at once de
cided to prosecute Murray and Hansen
as the term of service of the deserters
had not expired.
The section of the Penal Code under
which the complaint was drawn reads:
"Every person who entices seamen to de
sert from any vessel lying in the waters
of this State and on board of which they
have shipped for a term or voyage un
explred at the time of such enticement
is guilty of a misdemeanor."
Murray and Hansen were arrested and
released on $300 bonds each.

THE steamship George "W. Elder,
which arrived yesterday from
Astoria, had a terrific experience
at the outset of her outward voy
age frbm* this port. . She left
here on May 18 and all went well
until an attempt was made to
round Point Reyes. There was a big
sea runnine. but the Elder has faced big
seas before and Captain Clem Randall has
weathered' too many gales In tugboats to
feel fear on the. bridge of a stanch. Bteami
ship. As the Elder poked her nose around
the shelter of the point she received the
full force of the hurricane, in recording
which the weather man at the Point
Reyes station made a record that may
win him promotion. While the instru
ments in charge of, Weather Observer W.
W. Thomas were telling of wind velocity
that made the Galveston hurricane seem
like a trade wind. Captain Randall was
finding out that there were forces In
nature greater than could be generated In
the boilers of the Elder. The wind ef
fectually barred the steamship's progress
and every time her head appeared beyond
the lee of the/land, round it was whirled
by the awful force of the wind. After an
hour of fighting, in which the Elder made
not "one foot of headway, she turned tail
and ran for the friendly shelter of Drakes
Bay. There the Elder anchored about S
p. m. and there she remained until 5 a. m.
of May 19. There were eighteen coasting
schooners sheltering in Drakes Bay when
the iSlder reached the friendly anchorage
and before she resumed her voyage the
fleet was augmented by the German
steamship Serapis, the big freighter
Hyades and a few more sailing craft/
When the Elder sailed the following
morning she went out in the teeth of a
stiff gale, but was able to hold her own
and make fair time to her northern des
tination. Before leaving the steamship
the passengers took occasion to express
to Caotain Randall their appreciation of
his watchful care in the time of danger.
Captain Randall says that he never be
fore felt tho wind blow with such vio
lence.

DO NOT NEGLECT
THE LITTLE JLIS OF TO-DAY
The Use of
PAINE'S
Celery Compound
Will Eradicate From the Blood
v *" and System the Seeds â¢
of Disease.
As grains of sand make our lofty moun-
tains, drops of water trie mighty ocean
and as our massive buildings are made of
one brick piled upon another, so do the
little ilia of life contribute to the building
up of deadly diseases In the body.
Experienced medical men claim that
fully three-fourths of our men and wom-
en enter the summer season with little ills
and symptoms of disease, which must de-
velop into serious and fatal troubles If
not banished at once.
We hear our friends complaining daily
of rheumatic tendencies, sharp and dart-
ing neuralgic pains, dyspepsia, pains in
the side and back, nervousness and sleep-
lessness; and we see with our own eyes
the effects of impure blood In facial
blotches, eruptions and sores. The llttl*
ills and pains of to-day build up the
alarming and fatal diseases that follow
days and weeks of neglect.
Wise and Intelligent people who have
looked into the claims of Palne's Celery
Compound and followed its remarkable
cures of relatives, friends and neighbors,
use It themselves with faith and confi-
dence to banish their symptoms of com-
ing troubles, to cleanse the blood, to re-
establish nerve force, energy and bodily
strength, so that they will be in condition
to withstand the enervating effects of the
coming hot weather.
In every community where Palne's Cel-
ery Compound has been used at this sea-
son to banish disease it is regarded as a
gedsend. Workers in offices, shops, fac-
tories and weary and rundown wives and
mothers in their homes have thanked
heaven for Dr. Phelps' marvelous pre-
scription, because it made them well. Try
a bottle or two, ye .who are ailing and
sick; It will give you what you most
stand in need ofâ health and new life.

A PESTIFEROUS GERM
Burrows Up the Scalp Into DandruS
and Saps the Hair's Vitality.
People who complain of falling hair as
a rule do not know that It is the result
of dandruff, which is caused by a pestif-
erous parasite burrowing up the scalp as
it digs down to the sheath in which the
hair is fed in the scalp. Before longr the
-fcair root is shriveled up and the hair
drops--out. If the work of the germ is not
destroyed hsJr keeps tldnnlng {tt\ bald-
ness comes. The only way to cure dan-
druff Is to kill the germ, and until now
there has been no hair preparation that
would do It; but to-day dandruff is easily
eradicated by Newbro's Herplcide, which
makes hair glossy and soft as silk.

Thursday evening at 8 o'clock at Century

League. Mayor Schmitz will preside and
Mrs. Frederick Nathan will address the
meeting on the work of the Consumers'

Among the honorary vice presidents of the

of the Mayor of New York and the wife of the
Embassador to England and other persons of

Shoppers must form leagues â¢ and give pref
erence as far as practicable to those stores
where "- employes are treated fairly; where
clerks receive a fair- living wage and where
reasonably short working days are in effect;
where seats are provided behind the counters
and where the surroundings are sanitary and
cheerful. â¢
It /is not the purpose Â¦ of ' the Consumers"
league ta arouse the antagonism of the mer
chants.' The league realizes, the difficulties of
the storekeeper in endeavoring to maintain
high business principles under the oressure of
cutthroat competition. -- ,
We. pay. nil our bills -promptly so that em
ployes may, also be. paid regularly. This is
always a duty, and. It ls of vital Importance
j. in the case of dressmakers, milliners, tailors,
grocers and all small" employers. "We avoid
rush orders , to tailors,, dressmakers - and â¢ so
forth,, so that . the employer may be under no
temptation to oblige a : customer by breaking
the law restricting, the. hours of labor.
Â¦ A woman . who Joins our league agrees to
shop early in the day. She does not Insist that
her goods shall be delivered on the same day,
declining to receive anything after 6 p. m.
This enables the delivery men. and errand boys
to nnlsh their labors early. A member of our
league does her Christmas -shopping early. She
avoids shopping in the evening and on Satur
day afternoons. She does not even ring up the
grocer or the butcher by telephone on Saturday
afternoons and orders goods. Â¦ ' Â¦ /

less .'to maintain a high standard as to hours,
wages and working conditions under, the stress

In an interview Mrs. Nathan said:
Among yesterday's arrivals at the Pal

of the Consumers' League of j New York.
She is a well-known, society woman : of

"A Bachelor's Romance" pleasantly en
tertained a large audience at the Califor
nia last night. The Nelll company- as a
whole appears to unusual advantage in
this -play. Nelll himself, however, is per
haps better Â¦ adapted for a more serious
part than that of the fossilized editor,
and Edythe Chapman, unfortunately, has*
a role of minor importance. The placeof
leading lady: is filled very, acceptably nev
ertheless by Mary Elizabeth Forbes, who
In voice, action and expression seems al
most a counterpart of Miss Chapman.
Lillian Andrews as Miss Clementina is
exceedingly amusing. John Â¦ W., Burton,
Donald Bowles and Clifford Dempsey add
materially to the fun of the comedy. One
of the most pleasing features of the play
is the final scene, â¢ where , the literary and
social lights have forgotten their usual
vocations and amusements and are huge

Chutes.
An excellent vaudeville programme was
enjoyed at both performances at the
Chutes yesterday by large audiences. Da
vis and De Hearde, a clever colored cou
ple, scored a distinct hit and were en
cored for their sin gins: of "The Phre
r.olopist Coon" and "I Want to Be a
leading Lady." The talented Sorensen
children, Maude and Gladys, presented
new specialties, even better than those
of last week; Jack Symonds. the merry
minstrel, told new stories and sang new
pongs: Byrne and West changed their act
and Bacon and Vane continued their ope
ratic success. "Pygmalion and Galatea."
The animatoscope showed many new and
amusing moving pictures. Thursday night
the success of last week, the Florodora
sextet by amateurs, will be repeated.
engagement at the Grand Opera-house
last night in "The Little Minister." The
house was packed and she met with a
very flattering reception, being called be
fore the curtain after the close of each
act. She gave a charming portrayal of
the part of Lady Babbie. There is a natu
ralness about her acting that is capti
vating, and it was no wonder that the
Little Minister was fairly bewitched by
her. In the scene. where Gavin avows his
love for her before her father and Cap
tain Halliwell she was particularly ef
fective. Herschel Mayall was very suc
cessful as Gavin Dlshart His represen
tation of the character was manly, dig
nified and modest. Gardner Crane as
Thomas Whammond. the chief elder, had
a poor conception of the part. He made
it too melodramatic and missed the fine
points of a character that should stand
cut prominently. Fred J. Butler was ef
fective as Rob Dow and William Bernard
was convincing as Lord Rintoul. Donah
Benrlmo presented a fine piece of char
acter work as Felice, the French maid.
The rest of the support was not up to
the mark. It would be an advantage if
the attempt to speak the Scotch dialect
was abandoned. The scenery was ex
cellent.
Grand Opera-House.
Miss Maude Fealey, the youngest lead
ing lady In the country, commenced an
Orpheum.
Orpheum patrons have everything: that
is coming to them in the way of amuse
ment this week. There is not a number
on the programme that ls not first-class.
That the show is appreciated is evidenced
by the hearty applause that greets the
least effort of the performers. Peter F.-
Dailey. of course, is the headllner. With
the aid of an able company the Irrepressi
ble Peter gets a whole lot of fun out of a
skit entitled the "Dress Rehearsal."
Sager Midgley and Gertie Carlisle present
"After School" with great cleverness, and
Lotta Gladstone, as the "Quaint Country
Girl,". makes a hit as soon as she appears
Her laughing song is as clever a piece of
work as has been seen here In some time.
Stuart Barnes' monologue and songs,
given in his own Inimitable manner, and
the two little Pucks make the audience
merry for a quarter of an hour. The rest
of the show is equal to the Orpheum
standard.
Central.
"Hands Across the Sea," the Central
Theater attraction for the current week,
scored an immense hit last night on its
production by a cast which was strong,
both In an artistic and a numerical sense.
The play is full of life and action, and
the.re are thrilling scenes in . ev/ery act.
The drama ls magnificently . staged, and
the scenic artists of, the Central merit

Few pieces have been put on locally : of

of scenery, and the crowded house last
night gave enthusiastic evidence of their
Immortals may knowâ introduces
Kathryn Kidder to San Francisco for the
season of 1902 most felicitously. The char
acter of the title, as well as the comedy
Itself, are froth of the very lightest sort.
The women are addle-headed fools â the
women of the play, mind you, the make
believe onesâ the men are ninnies and
roues, or a combination of both: there Â¦
is not a noble line in the piece, not a
holy emotion, not a touch of natural
humor of the kind that is appreciated in
the twentieth century, and the wicked
ness is so. open and unabashed that it
loses its spice. But the audience laughs
through it all*and gets Its money's worth,
not from the lines, but from the merit of
the actors. Miss Kidder faced her first
San Francisco audience of the year, she
informed her manager, with nc little
trepidation and uncertainty, she whose
fame has become certain beyond all cavil,
but the warm greeting of generous and
grateful San Francisco when she bounded
upon the stage in her unhandsome make
up dispelled all her misgivings, and, reas
sured, she played the part of Peggy for
all that was in it. There was only one
little shortcoming and that was in her
make-up. She is spoken of by her in
tended husband as ugly, but the make-up
revealed so much of Kathryn amid so lit
tle of Peggy that the audience didn't
think it at all strange that Mr. Bellville
should fall in love with her. The support
ls first class, especially the women.
Marion Ashworth is a stately beauty, with
ey"es that " do very many heart-breaking
tricks in the role of Alithea. Miss Olga
Flinck, the Lucy of the cast, is a sou
brette of the first water. None of the au
dience would suspect that she Is almost a
novice and that Lucy ls the first role of
any- prominence that she has ever -been
favored with. The fun-maker is Sparkish.
He is a most excellent fool and his drun
ken scene in the last act kept the house
in a titter. His other name is Robert
Ferguson, and if he plays other char-*
acters as well as that he is cheap for
his salary. T. C. Hamilton as Mqody does
the heavy work and does it well. Nor
man Hackett, an excellent actor in
Shakespearian tragedy, Â¦ with a staccato
laugh four fathoms deep, acts well when
he forgets - Macbeth, which Is seldom.
His song in the garden scene, however,
more than made up for the misfit. Mon
roe Salisbury was well fitted to the role
of Bellville. There was a good house
and the applause was liberal.

it should be Immortal only the
M. L. AIsop as Septimus, the man
whose attempt to hide the truth of a
"quiet little time" from his wife and who
thereby gets everybody, including him
self, in a peck of serious trouble with the
police, is the limit. He infuses a vein of
original wit into the part and dresses it
up considerably. George Osbourne, his
stage father-in-law, gives the ,various sit
uations In the piece a tinge of quaint
humor that Is particularly pleasing. Juliet
Crosby makes an excellent Petunia, and
Marlon Convere, the easily deceived wife,
comes in for her share of favorable criti

and Harry Scott carry their parts well, as

cast embraces Miss Fanny Mclntyre,
Earle Brown, Georgie Cooper, Edwin Em
ery, William Bray. James Corrlgan,
Julius McVlcker, Stanley Ross, George
Webster, Frank Thompson, Agnes Rank
en, George Nicholls and Herbert Farjeon,
and consists of thirty people in all. Stan
ley Ross and George. Webster have French
character roles, and fill the bills excel
lently. Edwin Emery and Georgie Cooper
furnish some very pleasing comedy, while
James Corrigan shows his versatility in
making as much out of the serious part
of Melville, the reckless financier,, as he
usually does out of comic parts. Julius
McVicker essays the heavy villain with
credit. Earle Brown, as John Dudley, the
fugitive from French injustice, gave an
Impersonation that was worthy and sat
isfying, and Fanny Mclntyre was the
heroine to perfection: In one short week
she has won her way to favor, at the
Central, and her talent and ability give
assurance of continued treats during her
engagement. The revolving "prison scene
in "Hands Across the Sea is a splendid
bit of stage mechanism, while, the ship
scene, where the British merchantman is
overhauled by a French gunboat, is real
istic and exciting in the extreme. On
Friday, May 80, Decoration Day, the Cen
tral will give a special matinee perform
ance of "Hands Across tne Sea." Â¦
Tivoli.
"The Singing Girl" continues at the
Tlvoli Opera-house. The music of this
light opera is very popular and is being
hummed all over town. The Tivoli com
pany does justice to the opera, Annie
Meyers makes a charming singing girl
and Messrs. Hartman, Webb and Cash
man keep the audience In good humor
with their droll sayings and topical, songs.
The chorus renders Its numbers In unison
and In harmony. ' The play will be suc
ceeded next week by "The Toy Maker,"
the big success of last season.
Fischer's.
"Fiddle Dee Dee," the burlesque that
has scored such a hit .with the theater
goers of this city, began its tenth week
at Fischer's last night. The attendance
was as large as on the opening night.
New songs were introduced and were ap
preciated by the audience, j The work of
Kolb and Dill, Barney Bernard, Maud
Amber, Harry Hermsen and other clever
members of the company was well re
ceived. The burlesQue bids fair to have
an almost endless run at the theater.

At the conclusion of Miss Perry's tes
timony the hearing went over until this
morning.
When pressed by Mark to tell who the
Director was Miss Perry refused to an
ewer. The witness said Blanchard had
at all times treated her unjustly and on
several occasions had "sneaked" into her
room through the back way.
.Miss Perry told him she had made en
tries of the matter in the school register
at the dictation of the principal. This
ir eluded the statement that the boy was
guilty of disobedience, absence from
school, lying, insolence and forgery. Miss
Perry said that when Blanchard ordered
her to write a statement on the black
board that other boys would be whipped
as John Raggio had been if their con
duct did not improve, she directed one
of her pupils to do the writing. Miss
Perry also testified that she had been
dismissed from her position one evening
by Blanchard, who said that it was for
his own interest that he did so. Miss
Ferry said that she was under the im
pression that she was to retain her posi
tion permanently. Asked where she had
got that impression she replied that one
of the Directors had intimated that she
was safe because no one else wanted the
class, as it was very unruly.
Miss Perry, who was an extra substi
tute in the Hancock school, testified that
Bianchard came into her room with the
rote of excuse and said:
"This is a forgery. John is a liar.
This is a *dbck-and-bull* story."
Mrs. Raggio, the mother of the boy,
gave her testimony through an interpre
ter. She testified that she knew her boy
ha.<l been a truant but he had promised
to reform. . She also testified that she
fcaw her boy write the note but nothing
important was developed by Mrs. Rag
gio's testimony.
John itaggio was the lirst witness
piaced on tne stand. He testified as to
111s truancy and the writing of an ex
cuse. The note was introduced in evi
dence and purported to have been signed
by the mother of the boy. Young Kag
eio stated that in giving the note to his
principal he Informed nim that a lady
r.iid written it. He afterward admitted
that he wrote the note himself, but with
the full consent of his mother. Raggio
suid that Dr. Blanchard had shaken mm
alter the talk about the note.
At the outset of the trial it was decided
by the votÂ»s of three Directors that evi
dence that Blanc hard had been brutal to
the boy would not be accepted because
the charge had already been disposed of
when Blanchard had been reprimanded
by the Board. Director Roncovieri voted
against dropping the charge of inflicting
unusual punishment on tne ground thai
Blanchara haa never been tried on mat
charge. Blanchard had for his attorney
Â¦\V. \\. Sanderson, and tne prosecution
was conductea by F . J2. Latimer.
Milton E. Blanchard, principal of the
Hancock Grammar School, was on trial
before the Board of Education yesterday
on charges of unprofessional conduct and
a violation of the rules in having severe
ly flogged a pupil, John Raggio.

REDDING, May 26.â All doubt that Mrs.
Eli F. Dack of this city, wife of an ex
policeman, is actually to inherit $1,800,000
from the estate of her grandfather in
Germany seems cleared away. | Mrs. Dack
has received the first payment, which in
dicates that the Berlin court accepts her
proofs of identity. Â¦ â¢.
Mrs. Dack was shown to be the grand
daughter of Frederick Emrlck, a wealthy
furrier, said to have been the partner of
John Jacob Astor, who died In Berlin
twelve years ago. Of his estate $9,000 000
was left to the family of each of his two
sons in the United States, William Em
rick of Michigan and George Emrick of
Portland, Or. William Emrick and - his
children received part of their share some
time ago. George Emrick had four chil
dren. All are dead except Mrs. Eli Dack
of Redding and Mrs. Sarah Sheppard of
Portland, but the deceased i heirs leave
children, who will receive their shares
so $9v000,000 is to be divided into five por
tions, the father sharing equally with the
children. â¢
Mrs. Dack returned a week ago from
Portland, where she and her father and
sister were met by William Emrick and
their attorneys from Michigan. A I con
sultation was held. Then Mrs. Dack re
turned to Redding and received 11000 the
first installment of her fortune. The at
torneys say the entire amount will be
paid to her within five months.

Dow and his present wife had some dif
ficulty in Los Angeles several months
ago and she had him arrested for threat
ening her life. . -
Charles F. Dow, a Pullman â¢ car con
ductor running between Oakland and El
Paso on the Southern Pacific, was taken
into custody at the ferry yesterday by
Detective George McMahon, acting un
der instructions from District Attorney
Byington, on suspicion of being a-bjga
mist. The Information against him was
given by a woman whom he married at
Victoria, B. tj., about a year and a half
ago. Â¦ She says that they went to Los
Angeles to live, and that there she be
came acquainted with the fact that he
had been married three times previously
to other women, and she believed he had
not been legally separated from all of
them at the time he married her.
The latest acquisition to Dow's matri
monial collection arrived from Los An
geles several days' ago and stopped at the
Occidental Hotel for a time, but left there
and, has kept her- present address a se
cret. She. gave only her telephone num
ber to the District Attorney. She goes
under the name of Sadie Moore.
Dow admits that he has been -married
quite extensively, but claims that divorce
courts purged him of these entangle
ments. He says he secured one divorce
at Sedalia, Mo., and another at Pueblo,
Colo. The wife from whom he was part
ed at Pueblo Is at present In San Fran
cisco and was located by Detective Mc-
Mahon. She said she had been di
vorced from him. A telegram was sent
to Sedalia late last night, and at a late
hour a reply was received confirming
Dow 3 claim that he secured a divorce in
that city. Dow was at once released from
custody. Â¦ Â¦

BOARD CANNOT
REGULATE FARES
Supervisors Have No
Power to Reduce
Rates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 26.
Supervisors have no power to regulate
street car fares. This was decided to
day by District Attorney Allen, and the
Supervisors adopted his decision.
For some months the people of Elm
hurst have been trying to force the Oak
land Transit Company to give them a
live- cent fare to Oakland, the rate now
being ten cents. They appealed to the
Board of Supervisors and asked the
county legislators to regulate the price
of the ride. The matter was referred to
District Attorney Allen for his opinion
which was rendered to-day, and declares
that this is outside of the power of the
Supervisors. -The decision reads:
- Section 501 of the Civil Code under the title
of "Street Railroad Corporations" 'provides
"The* rates of fare on the cars must not ex
ceed 10 cents for. one fare for any distance
under three miles." I can find no powers spe
cifics lly granted to. the Board of Supervisors
affecting tho subject of street railway fares

lOKMES SUCCESS.
This 'move is the result of the success
of the organization of cooks and waiters,
formed about a year ago. The flr3t fight
the union made was to secure a reduc
tion of working hours from seven days to
six days a week without a cut in the
wages. To this arrangement the restau
rant and hotel men agreed with one ex
ception, which was old Barnum's. But
after a fight that restaurant was added
to the list, of union houses, and the six
day week was made unanimous.
In submitting the new schedule the
union has covered all matters connected
with the conditions of employment. It
claims that the adjustment is fair and
equitable to all concerned. The restaurant
proprietors have not made up their minds
about the agreement. In some cases the
best cooks are receiving more than the
union schedule. Others say they cannot
afford to make the increases the union
demands.
The six-day week is maintained and
provision is made for reference to a board
of arbitration of disputes which might
arise over interpretation of the agree
ments and provisions. k
The agreement as submitted to the em
ployers is signed by George Waller, presi
dent, and Perry Conwell, secretary of tho
union.
Further the union demands that the
"off day" man who shall work the sev
enth day shall receive time and a half
for that day. The schedule now In force
provides for a six-day week of employ
ment.
The agreement also presents a new set
of general rules, some of which are as
follows: . . '
It is agreed that no Japanese or Chinese wiU
be employed In union houses.
It is agreed by the employer that no em
ploye shall suffer a reduction In wages or
an increase in hours on account of the adop
tion of this agreement.
It is optional with the employer as to tha
display at the union house card.
Extra waiters are scheduled to receive
$2 50 for the first day and $2 for eaca
additional day.
Where a man fills a position of cook and
waiter (.this man to be known aa the swln*
man) he shall receive $11 per week.
Another new clause is as follows:
SWING BLA2TS WAGES.
Chief cooks, |3 60 for the first day and $3
for each additional day; second cooks, $3 for
the first day and $2 SO lor each additional day,
night cooks, $3 tor the nrst day and $~ 60 for
each additional day; kitchen substitute. 91 oo
for the first day and $1 25 tor each additional
day.
The principal change over the present
rate is an Increase of $2 a week In nig tit
cocks' pay.
Under tne head of "extra cooks" a new
rate is established as follows: !/â¢â¢
The employers have been given until
June 3 to make answer to the demand*
of the union. The ultimatum on the part
of the cooks and waiters is a strike un
less the schedule or the main features of
It shall be accepted. The employers,
through their president, R. W. Merrlck,
have called a meeting of their associa
tion for. to-morrow afternoon at whlca
the union's schedule will be discussed
and a decision will probably be reached
whether the demands will be accepted.
The union has, In the first place, fixed
a new schedule of wages, as follows:
Cooksâ Chief cooks, per week, $14; second
cooks, per week, $12; night cooks, per weed.
$12; kitchen subs, seven days. $S; kitchen subs.
six days, $7; overtime, 25 cents an hour.

There is a battle Impending between thÂ«
Cooks' and Waiters' Alliance No. 31 and

has submitted to the employers a demand
carrying an agreement for a new sched
ule of wages, hours and conditions of em

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SEATTLE, May 26.â Trouble on board
the Lnlted States revenue cutter Thetis
has culminated In a court martial. Cap
tain Healy, after coaling &t Comox, B. C,
sailed for Port Townsend instead of pro
ceeding north, and there preferred charges
of insubordination against the third of
ncer Lieutenant F. W. Smith. An ln
Â£ Â£ a ,H on was had *"Â»Â« lh e reports of

? Â», Â£ ory is that the captain went on
the bridge when Lieutenant Smith was
there as navigating officer and attempted
to look at the chart, whe'n he was grossly
ln Â£u lte ? by "eutenant Smith.
The junior watch officer of the Thetis
has the reputation of being somewhat er
ratic, but his conduct In times of emer
gency has outweighed his shortcomings,
fc'ome years a*ro. when cruising on the
cutter Algonquin, he was found guilty of
absenting himself temporarily when in
charge of the watch at night, and was
retraced seven numbers. Soon after this,
when the hurricane and tidal wave swept
oalveston, Tex. f he was serving on the
cutter Galveston at that port and dis
tinguished himself by taking a boat from
the cutter Into the town and saving many
Jives at the risk of his own.
The Thetis has sailed from Port Town

had a narrow escape this afternoon from
being burned to death while asleep in her
residence at the corner of Tamalpais

Mrs. Stevens, who is 73 years of age,
had gone up stairs to lie down. Sne

smoke issuing through her bedroom door,
which she had left open.
The old lady was the only one in the
dwelling at the time of the fire. As soon
as she was awakened by the smoke shÂ«5
gave the alarm. The fire department,
after a hard fight, got the flames under
control, but the house was badly dam
aged.
The fire originated from an oil stove in
the kitchen. Mrs. Stevens had lighted the
fctove to make tea. She went away and
left it and during her absence the wick
of the burner worked up, the flame Ignit
ing some tapestries, and, finally, the
woodwork. The loss is estimated at
iibout $2000.

A SYSTEMATIC BOYCOTT
CHICAGO. May 26.â And now it is the
plumbers' trust that may be investigated
by the Federal authorities. The National
Association of Master Plumbers of the
United States is the name of an organiz
ation which has its headquarters in Kan
sas City. The charges against the plumb
ers' trust are as follows:
It applies the boycott, and weekly advises
its members of the existence of such boycott
tsii the names of the firms or men boycotted,
publiEhes each month a list of the manufac
turers and Jobbers to whom goods can be sold
and applies the boycott if the members deviate
from the list.
In Chicago It pools contracts and awards
contracts to suit its pleasure. It is said that
although in Chicago only about one-half of
the plumbers belong to the combine, fully 95
per cent of the trade in other sections of the
country is in the trust. Every week, for year*,
the general officers in Kansas City have sent
out circulars calling attention to the boycott
maintained against two Chicago concerns.

taxpayers from that district favored the
Fpecial levy-
The board will further consider the
question this afternoon.
"I have looked carefully into the ques
tion of hospital and schools," said Mavor
Schraitz. "a.nd I lind that there is a cry-
Ing need for both. It i S supposed that
the proposed special levy is for this year
only, as the emergency will then have
disappeared, and other needs mav be
taken care of by bond issue. I suggest
that the members e>t the board visit the
F(lioo!s and judge for themselves of what
i.i needed."
MAYOE FAVORS LEVY.
Director Woodward said that with the
limited appropriation for the School De
partment it would be absolutely impossi
ble to erect any new buildings. The
necessity for levying a special tax is ap
parent, and this method is preferable to
a bond issue, as the interest on the bonds
would necessitate an increased taxation
over tho dollar limit, said Woodward.
When Woodward said that it was the in
tention of the Board of Education to ask
for a special tax of 7Vi cents for the next
ten years Supervisor Sanderson Interposed
Jhat the proposed suspension of the dollar
limit was not temporary, as. the charter
required. Supervisors Braunhart and
Brandenstein stated that the board would
jiot pledge itself 10 a second special levy,
as it Is only concerned with present con
ditions.
Director Roncovieri r>j2d a statement in
â¢which he aserted that this municipality
has been criminally negligent in permit
ting children to he herded in overcrowded
class-rooms, by far too small and whose
sanitary conditions are of the worst.
SAYS CITY IS NEGLIGENT.
Sanderson produced a statement from
the Board of Public Works to the effect
that ttiere are thirty-one rented rooms
liscu by the department, forty vacant
rooms in all school buildings and a total
excess -of 1177 seats above the number of
pupils in attendance. Mark denied the
ii<-curacy of the statement, and Branden
etcin suggested that the )3oa.d of Educa
tion furnish its own figures on the sub
ject.
"If you would calculate the interest
and sinking fund for a bond issue for this
year," said Denman, "it would equal the
1\k cents proposed to be levied, and the
urgency of the proposition is apparent."
Director Mark appealed to the board to
pass Supervisor Wilson's measure, as he
said the time had come when the Board
of Education could not wait any longer
for proper schoolhouses. In answer to
Connor's query Mark said that it will
take $1,500,000 or $1,600,000 to maintain the
School Department . properly. With the
State allowance estimated at $70,000, and
the levy of 7'i cents, Mark thought the
board could build five or six new school
houses..
When the special levy for schools was
taken up Director Denman said that the
appropriation for schools would be insuf
ficient to build new schoolhouses. Den
man appealed for suitable accommoda
tions for pupils of fifty classes located in
outside rooms, which he said are unfitted
for the purpose.
PLEA FOB, NEW SCHOOLS.
Chris Stader. representing the Glen
Park Improvement Club, stated that the
people 01 the district named are all in
favor of the special levy for a hospital.
Cuitis explained that Supervisor
Comto was unavoidably absent and there
fore no action could be taken on the
measure, as it required a unanimous vote
01" the board. Curtis then introduced an
ordinance covering the special levy of 7%
oentfl for this year, which was referred to
ihâ¢ Judiciary Committee to determine its
legality. The board decided to meet to
day at 2 p. m.. when a vote will be
taken en the bill.
"It is hardly necessary to say to the
members of this board that there is an.
urgent need lor a new hospital," said
D'Ancona. "From a modern standpoint
San Francisco has no hospital. It has
no means to house its sick or to give
them the proper medicine or treatment
they require. Every physician will say
that the present institution is a blot on
the civilization of this city. The build
ing was erected as a temporary structure
wuh no modem appliances. Tbe sick are
not provided with reasonable means of
recovery in the ramshackle structure
called a hospital, and it is the duty of
this board to safeguard the health of the
fIck poor."
NEED FOB, NEW HOSPITAL.
Supervisor Curtis stated that some 150
letters of approval of the plan from va
rious organizations, besides a petition
feigned by lu.ouo people, had been filed.
Curtis said that the total tax this year
(including T 3 .^ cents each for schools and
hospital) would only aggregate $1,225.
Kev. Dr. Doane declared that there is
urgent necessity for a new hospital, and
M. Kenny said that nine-tenths of the
people of the city were crying "shame"
on the board for not building a new hos
pital. Edward Ewald favored th'e levy
ing of a tax of 25 cents each year for five
years for schools and hospitals instead
of raising the money by a bond issue
which might be declared Invalid. B.
Lichtenstein, a member of the Grand
Jury, said that he had investigated the
matter and had concluded that the new
hospital should be built.
"I appeal to you in the name of the
unfortunate sick," said Father Casey,
'â¢that you adopt Supervisor Curtis' meas
ure. The old nospital is unfit for human
habitation. Conditions have been dls
praceful for the past twenty-five years
and the remedy has been avoided by suc
cessive Boards of Supervisors."
Rev. Father Peter S. Casey made an
earnest pica that a new hospital be built.
CITIZENS ADDBESS BOABJX
- Sanderson, who is said to be opposed to
any special levy, held that under . the
charter the levying of a second tax out
side of the dollar limit is illegal, as the
law provides that the limitations of tax
ation may be temporarily suspended so
as to enable the Supervisors to provide
for a great necessity or emergency. 'San
derson argued that to levy a. second tax
was not a temporary suspension of the
charter provision relating to the dollar
limit.
"1 trust that no legal technicality will
be interposed against the proposition to
do something for the comfort of the sick
poor." said Curtis. "I now ask that a
number of citizens who are present be
heard in support of the plan to erect a
new hospital."- '
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
sonsidered the proposed ordinances pro
rtding for the levying of a special tax
outside of the dollar limit of 7% cents
sach for the erection of a new City and
County Hospital and new schoolhouses as
submitted respectively by Supervisors
Curtis and "Wilson. While no action was
taken by reason of a full board not being
present, several of the Supervisors strong
ly favored both propositions and a num
oer of citizens urged the board to adopt
the ordinances in order to remedy exist
ing conditions.
"If we are to build a new hospital,"
said Curtis, "it is understood that the
money for the purpose must come outside
3f the dollar limit. It is proposed to levy
i special tax of 7VÂ£ cents on each $100 this
year and another 7% cents next year for
che purpose."

NSW YORK. May 20. â There was rather
more activity In the market to-day than dur
iaz the latter part of laet week, but it was at
/-Â« expense cf veluts cf standard stocks.
~"^::cre were tome Ej>eciaHies which stock ad
\V 3c< -6 would have served as a sustaining in
fluence under ordinary circumstances. Neither
Â¦was there any ba-J news to account for the
celling. The day's immediate developmente
were rather fefcLle, but the failure of tha
favorable developments and of the persistent
tardiness ef the market to attract any specu
lative demand for fctucks served to discourage
rant considerable holders who had tired of the
ljatsivity of the market, with the result -thai
ir.t-; unloaded considerable lints to-day. There
eetmed 10 lie a large speculation in J5t. Paul,
IJr.ion I'aclnc and less amounts of various
other stocks, which were urgently pressed for
ta.I<!. The only immediate news of a depress
ing character was the spread of the coal min
ing !a.t>or trouble* into some Â»ortions of 1 the
Â«_oal tielCs in Yireinia and West Virginia. The
coalers themselves, however, were little af
fected. Tiie rate for call money simmered
dowa to a ciulet 3-point basis, without any
notable demand in the foreign exchange market
for return of borrowed money abroad. â¢ Bu'
oespiie the relief accorded by the larte sumb
borrowed on the Euroi<ean Continent and from
our own domestic centers, there is tome solici
tude apparent in financial circles over the
future meeting of the large obligations which
bavt been incurred. Bankers are inclined to
nur>e their reserve to ume extent in order to
strengthen their position acainst the future
need. The apparent approach of peace in South
Africa was sn inspiring influence In foreign
stock markets, but seemed to be disregarded
here. Canadian Pacific continued its rernark
febie advance, whioh save rise to rumors of
*omethlns like a struggle for control between
the present dominant interest and the North
ern Securities group. There were a few minor
point* of etrenpth among the railroads. Rut
land preferred scored a 9-point recovery on
light transactions. Among the industrials
which were as resrular as the railroads Pressed
Steel Car was conspicuous for a rise of nearly
5 points without explanation. Favorable news
from the crop*, continued increases in railroad
earnings reported for the third week of May
and generally encouraging news from air
branches of industry except the coal trade
r^med to b* Ignored in the trading. The mar
ket closed quite active and irregular, but with
many prominent Btocks at about the lowest.
The bond market was rather dull nnd ir
regular. Total eales, f 2.041.000. United States
bonds were a!t unchanged on the last call.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO. May 26. â Wheat showed- a good
amount of strength all day, although early. in
the session there was a short-lived dip on a
dull market. Cables were weak, there was a
promise of better receipts from the Southwest,
and opinions differed about the weather condf
tlons. July opened a shade to HQYtC lower
at 73%@73%cito 73%@73Â«4c. A fair commis
sion house demand helped prices along for a
time, but prices early fluctuated very narrowly
because of good crop prospects. When the visi
ble supply showed a decrease of 2,048,000 bush
els and liberal decreases In local stocks wens
taken â Into . consideration, bulls began to lift
prices. Stocks here during the week had de
creased 410,000 bushels, and the Northwest had
lost 2,000,000 bushels. Traders who had been
in the country .Sunday talked of exces'sive"rains'
in many districts. . There was ' some fair late
activity and July sold up to 73%@74c mate
rially aided ' by the strength In com. The
close was firm, %@%c up at 73%@73%c. Â¦:
Â¦ Nearly every argument favored an upturn In
corn. ' Cables were firm, cash business was
good, and the- crowd, rather than sell short,
â¢ was Inclined to take all the scanty offerings
at better prices. â¢ July closed' strong, -*16xic
up. at tÂ»Â©63&c. "Â¦-- - . r
Â¦ Oats were quiet and relied on- corn for sup
port. July closed unchanged at' 37%c. Â¦-.-,â¢ Â¦ â¢
Provisions had to contend against -the weak
.enlng influence of a weak hog market at the
yards. Offerings- were liberal and prices de
clined easily. Late in the day. when- the pit
was dull, there was a light rally on the corn
strength, but the close was 10c lower for July
pork, lard and ribs 7%@10c lower.

will prevent any native of those islands who
may so desire, who is not under arrest and

The resolution went over until to-mor

WASHINGTON, May 26.â Captain Mc-
Donald, formerly of the . Ttirenty-slxth
Volunteer Infantry, one of the officers ac
cused in Corporal O'Brien's testimony,
was before the Philippine Committee of
the Senate to-day. He denied all of the
allegations made by O'Brien, and said
that O'Brien was elsewhere at the time
he claimed to have been present. McDon
ald denied the statement by O'Brien that
hoi (McDonald) and a number of other of
ficers misbehaved themselves at a native
dance. He showed that at the time al
leged Major Cook, one of the officers
named, and himself were on duty else
where. Captain 1 McDonald also . denied
that he ever had struck a prisoner on the
head with, a revolver, as O'Brien . had
charged.
"If," he said, "a prisoner had not done
as ordered, I should have had htm shot
instead of striking him." .
Speaking ot the treatment of peaceable
natives by the Americans in the Philip
pines, Captain McDonald said it was like
the treatment of a child by his father.
The witness also testified concerning
the capture of the barrio of Lanog, in
connection with which O'Brien had said
that an unarmed boy had been fired upon
by the entire command; that three old
men, two of them bearing a flag of truce,
had been shot down, and that a woman
and two children had been burned to
death. ,, He denied all the statements de
tailing these supposed circumstances, but
said it was true that the barrio had been
captured and burned. â¢ It was a stockaded
stronghold of ladrones, set on a hill and"
considered Inaccessible while the Span
iards controlled the country. When his
troops approached it the natives fired
first, but the place was taken. The Amer
icans occupied the town for hours, and
then, after giving ample notice of their
intentions, had set fire to the place. If
any person was burned to death he never
had heard of the fact: Nor had he ever
given any orders .while approaching the
place to take ho prisoners. â¢
Patterson of Colorado, one of the minor
ity members of the Philippine Committee,
occupied the floor of the Senate most of
the day in a discussion of the Philippine
question. Patterson quoted from. the ut
terances of his newspaner. the Denver
News, to show that it -Consistently had
advocated the independence of the Philip
pines since December, 1898. He said the
editorials quoted by Foraker 'some days
ago had been written prior to that time.
He discussed the whole Philippine ques
tion, a.nd several lively colloquies oc
curred during the speech. Foraker and
Hoar had a brief debate over President
McKinley's proclamation to the Filipinos.
â¢ Senator Hoar to-day introduced the far
lowing resolution: . .
Declares Allegations of Cor
poral O'Brien Are Not
Â¦ True.

McWilliams Case Continued.
The case of F. W. McWilliams, alias
Crothers, charged with grand larceny,
through, which" the alleged extoruon by
Policeman L. L. Levings was brought to
light, was called in Judge Mogan's court
yesterday. The Judge denied the motion
of ex-Judge Low to dismiss the case on
the ground that the charge should have
been obtaining goods by false pretenses,
holding that it was grand larceny, as the
tJtle to the goods had not been parted
with. Ivow then asked for a continuance
till to-day, as he wanted to call Marc
Augenblick as a witness, and It was
granted.
- Lichtenstadter Gets Dillard's Place.
The whereabouts of William H. Dillard,
the colored clerk and messenger In the
office of United States Internal Revenue
Collector John C. Lynch. Is still unknown
and the Collector yesterday appointed
temporarily Martin Lichtenstadter, a
white mm,- to the vaca.nt position. Dil
lard's wife, a handsome octoroon, is very
much concerned regarding his absence.
She informed the Collector that â¢Dillard
gave her the whole of his month's salary
when he was leaving to go on his vaca
tion excepting ?8. He did not take a
change of clothing with him and she is
fearful that he may have been the victim
of foul play.

The case against Policeman L. L. Lev
ings, who is charged with having at
tempted to extort tlje sum of $150 from
Mrs. Darling to square, a case in the
Police Court against J. E. Crothers, alias
McWilliams, was vigorously prosecuted
before the Police Commissioners yester
day afternoon. Chief Wittman had all the
witnesses against Levings on hand to tell
their stories, save Mrs. Darling. â¢ who is
seriously 111 at her home, 913 Dddy street.
Levings was not represented by an attor
ney, preferring to act as his own coun
sel.
Grover Klemmer, who alleges that
with Attorney Douglass he stood
behind a glass door In Mrs. Dar
ling's house and heard Levings
make , the proposition to * square the
case, orrather have the charge reduced
from grand larceny to petty larceny pro
viding Crotherfe would plead guilty, was
called to testify." He testified that on
Levings' first visit to Mrs. Darling's flat
he 'Klemmer) answered the policeman s
ring at the doorbell and showed him into
Mrs. Darling's presence. Klemmer testi
fied that after he let Levings into the
house he (the witness) left it by the back
door and going down into the basement
went upstairs to a do6r leading into the
hallway wherÂ© Levings and Mrs. Darling
were sitting and through the door he
heard Levings make an offer to square
the case for the sum of $150.
TELLS OF SECOND VISIT.
On the occasion of Levings' second visit
to the house Klemmer testified, that he
again heard the policeman make an offer
to square the case for $150. According to
the witness Mrs. Darling tried to get him
to take $100, saying that it was all that
she could afford, but LevingB was firm
and stated that he would not dirty his
hands with the case for less than $150.
Rigid cross-examination, conducted by
the accused policeman, failed : to : shake
Klemmer's testimony.
Attorney Douglass was then called and
corroborated the story of the affair as
told by Klemmer. Chief of Police.Witt
man read the testimony that Douglass
gave in the Police Court to ascertain if the
witness was willing to testify to the same
state of facts again. Levings objected
strenuously to this proceeding, on the
ground that even if the witness told an
untruth under oath in the Police Court
he would not be likely to admit it during
the Inquiry before the Commissioners. The
board overruled the objection and ordered
Chief Wittman to proceed with- the read
ing of the testimony.
<Marc Augenblick, a retail and wholesale
liquor dealer for whom young Crothers
worked, ' testified that Levings told him
that Mrs. Darling offered to pay. him $150
to reduce the case from grand larceny to
petty -larceny. On cross-examination,
however, Levings secured . the | admission
from the witness that he (Levings) had
told the witness that he did not intend to
have anything to do with Mrs. Darling's
proposition.
SOLOMON TESTIFIES.
Attorney .Solomon was called upon to
testify to a. conversation of little import
ance on the case which he had with Lev
ings while the ca6e against Crothers was
pending In the Police Court. Judge Mbgan
testified that at the time Levings is al
leged to have demanded the $150,- a por
tion of which it is alleged he said was for
the Judge, the defendant Crothers was on
the detinue book and the case was not as
signed to any court, a state of facts which
was readily admitted by. Levings and
Chief Wittman for the prosecution.
Mr. Esberg, a partner of M. A. Gunst,
from whom the goods , were stolen by
Crothers. told how Mrs. Darling sought
him, with tears .in her eyes, and tried to
get him to drop the prosecution of the
case. . Â¦ .
The matter went over until this even
ing, when the time of the further hear
ing of the case will be set. Mrs. Darling
is said to be too ill to attend the investi
gation, even if it were put over a month.
When the investigation Is taken up again
Livings will introduce the witnesses ror
the defense
The directors of the Builders'. Protective
Association met last night and considered
the proposition advanced by the Brother
hood of Carpen^rs relative to the res
toration of peace between the warring
factions of carpenters. The matter was
referred to a special committee, which
will xneet with a like committee from the
new district council of the brotherhood
to-day, when it. is believed some definite
plan wlll.be agreed upon.
Thus far the fight between the brother
hood and the:- Building Trades Council
has resulted only- in loss of time and ex
pense for the members of the unions af- {
.filiated with the. Building Trades Council,'
who have been called off jobs because
men of the brotherhood were at work
thereon. As the brotherhood carpenters
are all at work they have paid little at
tention to the discomfiture shown by the
members of other unions, . such as the
lathers, plumbers, painters, galvanized
Iron workers and others. The result has
been great dissatisfaction among the rank
end file of the unions, and it is predicted
that a general breaking away , from ' the
Building Trades Council will r*esult s at an
early date.
At a meeting of union No. 4S3 of the
Brotherhood of Carpenters last night it
â¢was reported that 1609 loyal brotherhood
men were at work in the city, and that
more could find work If they were here.
2t -was also shown that union No. 22, of
Â¦which P. H. McCarthy Is president > and
Â¦which was suspended by the brotherhood,
was accepting apprentices In order . to
snake a showing of strength. The state
ment was made that McCarthy, who
realized that he was losing ground, was
resorting to every means at his command
to make a showing of strength. TIm
brotherhood unions now regard their fight
as already won, and great enthusiasm is
manifested in consequence. * â¢
The boxmakers last night i**nt'Â©ut their

The journeymen barbers considered re
ports last night concerning their schedule
of wages, which Is to go Into effect on

The report that D. M. Burns as manager
of the boss . campaign in San Francisco
has been supplanted by John D. Macken
zie of Santa Clara seems to have founda
tion^ in fact. It is said that- Burns' in
difference to the fate of Gage waa ona
thing that suggested a change In boss
leadership. There is still another report
that Burns and Kelly have been figuring
together of late, and in their calculations
have not consulted Herrin. The active
politicians connected with the Primary
League appreciate the fact that Macken
zie will endeavor to rally the Gage strag
glers in the several Assembly districts <Ft
San Francisco. Probably the organiza-1
tion known as the Republican Count-/
Committee, of which very little has been
heard since the defeat of Wells and Fis 1 .;
at the late municipal . election in thU
city, will be used as the nucleus for tho
befcses. T. T>. Riordan is chairman of the
committee and Jesse Marks is a member
The story is credited that Burns. Johii
Lynch and Jere Burke declined to handle
the Gage campaign in San Francisco and
that Mackenzie was compelled by the
force of circumstances to take hold of the
machine. The politicians who are gener
ally classed as belonging to the Burns
push use the most significant epithets oÂ£
the boss vocabulary to express their con
tempt for Herrin. Outsiders cannot fully
account for the bitterness. It is known
that Herrin still recognizes Crimmins, al
though the little toss has no following to
speak of. Burns makes no 1 concealment
of his contempt for Crimmins and has
given out the word that he will not do
politics with any man. higfl or low, that
affiliates in any sense with Crimmins. The
politicians in Gage's camp who are in
sympathy with Herrin tell the Governor
that fellowship with Burns i3 the chief
reason of his great unpopularity. Gage is
constantly advised to break with Burn3
and inform the public of the break.
The members of the push committee
may be called together early in June to
consider the advisability of effecting dis
trict organization. As matters now stand
the Primary League and the independent
Rcpublcian clubs are In possession of the
fort, and the indications are that they
will sweep the field on the day of tbe pri
mary election.
McKENZIE REPRESENTS PXTSIT.
There is no gainsaying the fact that
Johnny Mackenzie is an active represen
tative of the pu^h element in politics, amV
with some of the patronage of the watfe.â¢
front to bestow and much to promise hÂ«
may succeed under cover In effecting or
gr~izatlon In several of the districts. He
will not be so foolhardy as to put
straight-out Gage delegate tickets before
the people, but will seek to trade on the
known loyalty of voters to the party to
elect delegations that can be lined up for
the bosses at Sacramento.
1 It Is In the power Â¦ of Republican citl
zeps to ascertain in advance the stand
ing on the gubernatorial question of every
man seeking to represent the voters of
his district in the State convention. De
lay In making delegate nominations and
submitting the names to the people will
excite suspicion. Voters may resolve to
repudiate all tickets made up on the evd
of the primary election. The Primary
League will probably have the several
district tickets published at least tw6 or
three days prior to the day of election.
"All signs in the boss camp strengthen
the report that Gage wiir l>Â« pulled down
before the ' convention assembles, but the>
machine will nevertheless make a des
perate fight to control thÂ© nominations.
Citizens who are ready to engago in tha
battle for good government and honest
administration of State affairs should re
solve at once- to- register and then lose no
time in seeking alliance with some district
organziatlon : known to be free from, boss
dictation.
The gossip that James A. Louttlt of San
Jcaquin is in the. field as an aspirant for
the Attorney Generalship Is not borne out
by the facts. The ex-Congrressir.an may
be brought forward as a candidate for
Governor In the event of a tie-up at Sac
ramento next August, but he is not now
a candidate. San Joaquin has a candidate
for Railroad Commissioner in the person
of Orrin S. Henderson, and his candidacy
is formidable enough to make- the
friends of N. Blackstock quite uneasy
Followers of Burns Express
the -Utmost Contempt
for Herrin.
He Is Appointed to L9ad

CATHOLICS WZLL HOLD
> ANNUAL GRAND OUTING
Until After Speculative Period
'" Has Passed. ' '
Merchants Vote for Change of Policy
The. members of the' Dairy- Exchange
held , a . meeting:, yesterday afternoon and
decided after, a thorough discussion to
eliminate the' exchange's quotations until
the 1st of next September. J By that time
it is expected that, the speculative period
will have been passed and that the mar
ket will have become firm enough to es
tablish a standard. .
' By suspending the quotations for the
time being the exchange has succeeded in
perpetuating its own existence, for it is
certain that had a change of policy not
been adopted several of ' the most im
portant firms' connected -.with, the ex
change would have broken 'a^v-ay.
The quotations are .the only portion of
the exchange's system that - has been
changed. The statements and receipts
will be 'Issued as usual. When the meet
ing was. called to order yesterday after
noon the eight firms which led the fight
rfcalnst the continuation of the quota
tions while speculation is in progress were
requested to withdraw and arrange their
demands In such a. form as might best be
presentedto the meeting.' Theeight firms
did so, and they also decided to inform
the other members of the exchange that
they reserved the right to break away at
any time that the policy of the exchange
became obnoxious to. them. â¢ . 'Â¦ -
The .suspension of the quotations will
leave all the wholesale dealers in butter,
eggs and cheese free to set their own
prices on those commodities. It will also
â¢result in the shippers or producers receiv
ing better'.prices for their produce.

v^^ son of C. A. Smith of the draying

ried in 1S95 to the woman he left to .wed
his new wife. He. and his former wife
lived very happily for several years, two
children being born" to them.; Then Smith
met Miss Florence Smith, the charming
daughter of Ferdinand Smith, the' broker,
and fell in love with her, and the young
woman 'returned his affections. ' Finally
the, former Mrs. Smith filed a suit for, di
vorce, charging her husband with deser
tion.. The* suit never came up for trial,
as a dismissal was filed, both Smith and
his wife agreeing to try and forget their
little differences and. the presence of the
broker's daughter. ' ' '
But It was not to be, for two, months'
after the dismissal of Mrs. Smith's suit

â¢Eighty Italian fishermen, headed by
Farce , Domenico, put on sackcloth 'and
ashes yesterday when they were inform
ed'Uhat 'Judge Nde Haven's judgment
awarding them $4000 had been reversed
by the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals. * _ ._
The fishermen brought suit In the Unit
ed States District Court last year to\re
cover $100 each on a labor contract. The
evidence was that they contracted with
the Alaska Packers' Association to go on
one of the association's steamers to Alas
ka ana work as sailors and tlshennen,
they to receive certain sums in propor
tion to the number of pounds of salmon
caught and other sums for working on
the vessel. , The men became dissatisfied
with the result of the season's catch and
ac Pyramid Harbor, Alaska, they struck
for $100 each over and above the contract,
and threatened to leave the vessel in a
bedy if their demand was not acceded to.
The superintendent explained to- them
that he had no authority. to rescind or
alter the contract made with the com
pany, but was obliged to make a con
tract for the additional JSOOO. It was im
possible for him to have obtained at that
place laborers to take the place of the
strikers to navigate the. vessel home.
OPINION OF INTEREST.
The opinion of the.' Circuit Court of Ap
peals was written by Judge Ross. It will
prove, of great interest and importance
to labor unions and employers of labor.
The opinion goes on to say:
From 5 the foregolne statement of the case
it will have been seen that the litigants agreed
in writing for a certain stated " compensation
to render their services to appellant in re
mote waters, where the season for conducting
fishing operations is exceedingly, short, and in
which enterprise appellant had a large- amount
of money invested; and after having entered
upon the discharge of their contract, and . at
a time when it was impossible for the com
pany to secure other men in their places, libel
ants, without any valid cause, absolutely re
fused to continue the services they were under
contract to perform unless the company would
consent to pay them more . money. Consent
to such ' a demand under such circumstances,
if given, was, in our opinion, entirely without
consideration, for the reason it was based
solely upon the Ilbelants" agreement to render
the exact services and none other that they
were already under contract to render.
BROKE OBLIGATION.
* ThÂ» case shows that they willfully and arbi
trarily, broke that obligation. As a matter of
course they -Jwere liable to the company in
damages, and it is . quite probable, as sug
gested by the â¢ court below,, that they might
have been unable to respond ih damages. But
we are unable to agree with the conclusion the
superintendent gave the men that he had no
power to alter the original 'Â¦ or to make a new
contract, and it would, of course, follow that
If he had no power to change the original he
would have no authority to waive any rights
thereunder.
â¢Judge Ross then quotes from King vs.
Duluth MV&-R. Co. 61 Minn., as follows:
No astute reasoning can change the plain
fact that the party who refuses to perform
and thereby coerces a promise from the other
party to the contract 'to pay him an increased
compensation for doing that which he' is le
gally bound to do j takes an unjustifiable ad
vantage of the Interests of the other party.- 1
Judgment' reversed and- cause remanded,
with Instructions to enter Judgment for the
respondent, with costs.
The marriage of Barbara Angelo^ch to
Frank Angelovich was annulled by Judge
Troutt yesterday because the consent of
Mrs. Angelovich to -the ceremony had
been obtained by intimidation. The wed
ding took place at the City Prison last
November, where Mrs. Angelovich and
Angelovich were confined on a charge of
vagrancy; both having been arrested at
the Olympic Theater by Police â¢ Officer
Coleman. Angelovich. was convicted and
sentenced to six months' imprisonment in
the CouriTy~ Jail, but Miss. Partman was
acquitted; Before the trial, however, An
gelovich, by means of threats to kill her
family, "even unto the fourth genera
tion," prevailed upon her to become his
wife. Mrs. Angelovich, fearing that the
release of her husband, which will occur
within a few days, will be the means of
bringing her. once more in touch with the
police, prefers single blessedness, hence
the suit for the annulment of her mar
riage. ââ¢ . . " '
