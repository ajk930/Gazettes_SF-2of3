thought that half of the people in the

seemed girls and young men, "well

' LONDON, June 2.â A Parliamentary pa
per issued to-night gives the correspond
ence preceding the peace agreement. From
this it appears that General Schalk-Bur
ger (acting President of the Transvaal) in
formed Lord Kitchener March 12 that he
was prepared to make peace proposals. A
month later the Boer delegates submitted
propositions. On April 13 War Secretary
Brodrick refused to entertain any proposi
tion based. on tHe independence of the're
publics. Subsequently President Steyn of
the Orange Free State and Generals
Schalk-Burger and Botha declared that
the Surrender of independence must be
submitted to the burghers in the field.
The British Government expressed sur
prise at this attitude, but announced, its
willingness to accept the. Boers' surrender
on the same terms that Lord Kitchener
had previously offered General Botha, and
to give facilities for a consultation of the
Boer commandoes. On May 17 General
Schalk-Burger and Steyn informed Lord
Kitchener that the burghers assembled at
Vereeniging had empowered a commission
to negotiate peace terms, subject to ratifi
cation af Vereeniging. -Lord Milner, Lord
Kitchener and the Boer commission met
May 19. The latter offered to surrender
the independence of the republics as re
gards foreign relations; to surrender part
of, their territory and retain self-govern
ment under British supervision. These
proposals were forthwith rejected* Â¦ The
same day Lord Milner, General Smuts and
Judge Hertzog drew up a form of agree
ment to be submitted to the conference at
Vereeniging _f or a yea or nay vote. Thia
was very similar to the final agreement,
and with few alterations was approved by
Chamberlain, who, in giving notice of his
approval, told Lord Milner he must inform
the Boers that unless it was accepted
within a fixed limit of- time the conference
would be considered -ended and his Maj
esty's Government would not be bound in
any way by the present declarations. The
Boers asked to be allowed until Saturday
night to give an answer, and- the result
was seen in the termination of- the war.

WASHINGTON, June 2.â Secretary
Moody has been informed of the findings
â¢of the court of inquiry which investigated
the conduct of the officers of the Chicago,
who were involved in the trouble at Ven
ice some weeks ago. This came in the
.shape of a cablegram from Admiral
Crowninshield at Castellamare. where lh"
European squadron is now lying. The de
partment deemed it well not to makÂ»
public at this time the conclusion reached
br the court. The present belief is that
tÂ£e officials have not seen fit to recom
mend a court-martial, but in view of the
clemency generously extended by the
King of Italy to the imprisoned officers it
is regarded as politic not to publish any
crTiclusions by the court that perhaps
might reflect on the Italian Judges and
the police officers cf Venice.

Patrol wagons from the Central, Har
rison-street, Twenty-second street. Cot
tage Grove Avenue and Thirty-fifth Street
stations were sent to the scene. The po
licemen surrounded the wagons and
foutjht back the crowds. Slowly the at
tacking- party gave way, and in the scrim
mage "the police- arrested six men, among
them Allen. Five patrol wagons were
detailed to accompany the meat wagons.
First the meat owners rescued the meat
from the muddy street, and then, under
heavy guard, drove to their places of
business.
A crowd awaited the wagons at the
packing plants and the drivers were hoot
ed and jeered, but there was no violence
until the wagons reached the Twelfth
street viaduct. There the crowds became
so large and so threatening that it was
deemed advisable to return the wagons to
the packing house plants. From a i few
hundred, the crowd had grown to thou
sands, and after the wagons had been
turned back they could not be driven
through the masses. The three policemen
accompanying them tried to frighten the
crowd by a display of weapons, but while
the policemen were attempting to guard
two wagons each the strikers and their
sympathizers removed the nuts on the
axles and cut the traces. The strikers
clambered into the wagons and threw
the meat into the street. The three po
licemen and the eight drivers, aided by
the owners of the shops, fought the mob,
but they were being rapidly overpowered.
Police Sergeant Mooney came to their
assistance. As he did so he was seen by
Edward Allen, colored. The negro, wield
ing a razor, threw himself at the police
sergeant. The two grappled and fought
in the Â«mud until the colored man, it Is
said, had cut the sergeant twice on the
head. Allen was then pulled away by
another policeman. Mooney was taken
to a hospital. .His. Injuries are not fatal.
SERIOUS NIGHT FIGHT.
To-night another serious fight took
place at Twelfth and State streets. Meat
was being removed from the packing
house plants by two retail firms, Frohlin
& Hcppe and Kettinger & Hoffher. There
were six wagons belonging to the first
Itrm and two to the second firm. In' thÂ«
atterncon the wagons had been loaded
and a police escort was secured to ac
company the loads. The owners of the
butcher shops were with the loads to en
courage their men and offer such assist
ance as they could in the event of trou
l)le.
Hundreds of factory hands were being
dismissed from the neighboring -shops.
Scores of heavily: loaded wagons drove up
and- in five minutes Haisted street was
packed and jammed with teams - and
wagons for four blocks. The crowd shout
ed and jeered at the police when they at
tempted to induce the teamsters to move
on. The police attempted a display of
force, only to arouse the crowd again.
Then stones were thrown at the police
and the rioters were clubbed and dragged
into patrol wagons.
Finally, after pushing and fighting for
a long time the police managed to get the
meat wagons to the barns and the doors
were closed. .* â¢ . â¢
By the time the barns were reached the
anger of jhe crowd had grown to lever
heat. An attempt was made to cross Hai
sted street, but in less than a minute a
block had been formed which it took' two
hours to release. The trouble at this
point began when a Halsted-street car
stopped airectly on the crossing. The car
was filled with passengers on their way
ftom work.' It was a peculiar coincidence
that. just as the pacKing house wagons
approached the crossing the current went
off. It was said that the trolley wire had
been cut. Â¦ 'â¢ : " - â¢
the police started away the mob formed
again and although at a respectful dis
tance they kept after the wagons until
they reacned the barns at Haisted and
Division streets. In this fight about a doz
en of the policemen were badly bruised
and nearly all of them had torn clothinir.
Many more of the mob were badly used

friends it is impossible to guess , at the
number. \ â¢. Â¦..â¢Â¦- - - Â¦ . ! -.

The news of peace in South Africa was
communicated to the Boer prisoners in
the inclosures on Hawkins Island last
night. The prisoners were delighted and
received the news with great enthusiasm,
shouting, singing and hurrahing. Some
of them rushed wildly about, embracing
every English soldier they met, and said,
"Yesterday we were foes, but to-day we
are friends."
Drinks were served out to the Boers on
Hawkins Island and the rejoicing there
continued until a late hour.

ceived the news with great joy. When
the .fact of peace was communicated to

ANNOUNCES THE TERMS.
TENSION IS OVER.
The tension was over, and when Bal
fcur's statement was concluded every one
seemed glad of the opportunity for a
hearty laugh, caused by the Government
leaders humorous quashing of the sug
gestion that the Commons adjourn in
honor of peace. Then the House. In
which even members could not find seats,
was emptied, and diplomats, Indian ra
jahs in gorgeous robes, peers and peer
esses and commoners and their guests
trooped into the lobbies, where general
congratulations followed.
Various objections to the peace terms
vere expressed, but they did not appear to
be very serious. "The Irish viewpoint was
that the Government had given up prac
tically everything, and that the regula
tions affecting the Cape rebels will be
done away with in consequence of the
King's amnesty proclamation. .
Embassador Choate did a lot of hand
shaking and took part in the general con
gratulations.
Chamberlain and Balfour 'both received
creat^vations as they walked to their
feats The lobbies arid waiting-rooms
were crowded with disappointed seekers
for seats, among whom were many. Amer
1C The period of waiting finally came to an
end Amid breathless silence, broken a
few seconds later by applause such as the
House of Commons seldom hears, Balfour
"tood Sn and announced the terms on
whÂ°ch the war in South Africa had been
Ti ded The reference to the Boers ac
knowledging King Edward as their sov
ereign made the hit of the day.
As the liberality ! of the terms grew
r.l&iner the cheers on the Government
side of the House diminished, while the
opposition's satisfaction was proportion
a $&SSU!?thi. the Irish members sat
impassive; though earlier in the afternoon
S had startled the House by a demon
stration which at first was thought to be
in honor of peace, but which, it was dis
covered was caused by the reappearance
in theHouse of William Redmond wno
has just returned from the United fatates.

Long before- the customary prayer the
galleries of the House were packed. Jo

The Prince of Wales and the Duke of
Cambridge went to the House of Lords
to hear the peace statement of the Pre
mier, Lord Salisbury. There was a large
attendance of peers and peeresses. Lord
Salisbury, before mentioning South Af
rica, referred to the great loss which the
empire had sustained in Lord Pauncefote,
who had done more than any other man
to cement the union of the two great
Anglo-Saxon races, which is one of the
healthiest and most promising- indica
tions of the times.
Lord Tweedmouth (Liberal) and Lord
Rosebery associated themselves with the
Premier's tribute.
Lord Salisbury then remarked that he
hoped the agreement on terms of sur
render would bring the lamentable state
of things in South Africa to an end, and
proceeded to read the terms of the agree
ment arrived at with the Boers. .
Lord Rosebery expressed his hearty, un
stinted and unreserved congratulations.

Every member offered congratulations to

Balfour having announced the Govern

moving a vote of thanks to Lord

the members of the House of Commons

Tha.t London's hilarity was not entirely

with his wife and party of friends entered
the box, he was cheered by the people
present. Several members of the House
of Commons who were in the stalls and
a number of society people cheered for
the popular secretary and joined lustily
in singing patriotic choruses. At the Ai
hambra the display of a union jack rid
dled with bullets and. other such incidents
guve occasion for repeated bursts of
cheering, and Lord Lansdowne and his
party thoroughly entered into the conta

WASHINGTON, June 2.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day declared the
right of a State of the Union to pass
laws excluding the body of a person go:ag
into a city or community which is quar
antined. The case In v.-hlch this decision
Â¦was given is one which was brought
against the Louisiana Board of Health
by the owners of the Britannia, a Fren'.-n
steamer, which sought to land Italian im
migrants in New Orleans in 1S9S. The city
then was Infested with yellow fever and
a quarantine was in force against it. The
Be aid of Health enforced the State law
authorizing exclusion from a quarantined
municipality, refusing to allow the im
migrants to land. The owners of the
steamer took the case to the State courts,
where the decisions were against them,
.there was an appeal to the V nited States
fcuprcme Court, and it was prosecuted on
liie ground that the law is a violation of
the interstate commerce law and also in
contravention of the treaty of 1503 with
t ranee. The opinion of the Supreme
court was handed down by Justice White
end sustained the State law, on the
ground that until Congress takes the
quarantine power from the States each
Mule is entitled to make and enforce its

Pcstofflce Inspector James O'Connell of
San. Francisco, B. T. Potter, ex-Postmas
ter of Baker City, Or.; M. H. Rowland,
of. Marengo, Iowa, and others were re
called and. testified this, morning. J. M.
Tignor, of Des Moines, 'one of the mem
bers of the company that owned the
White Swan mine, was called by the Gov
ernment in. an effort to impeach the tes
timony of Rosendale, but most of the tes
timony of Tignor was ruled out on the
ground that it had not been sufficiently
proven that he was a mining expert, and
capable of judging of the condition of the
"White Swan.
A number of witnesses were recalled by
the Government this morning, including
Miss Young, Balliet's clerk in the San
Francisco office, who testified early in the
case. She among other things
to-day that Balliet told her he paid $150
for a sealskin cloak for^Gertie Henderson,
a variety actress, and also bought her
rings and a sunburst of diamonds. This
is testimony the "Government has sought
all along to introduce to show that Balliet
squandered hundreds of dollars of money
paid over ' to him by the White Swan
stockholders.
DES MOINES, Iowa, June 2.â The Gov
ernment rested its case against Letson
Balliet at 1 o'clock to-day and this after
noon the defense began its introduction
of evidence. Counsel for the defense
stated that the mining experts would be
placed on the stand first to testify as to
the condition of the White Swan mine.
Their evidence will be much. the same as
that given by O. M. Rosendale last Friday
to the effect that the White Swan couM
easily be made a paying property.

The ailments and diseases that have held
people in bondage and suffering up to the
present can be permanently banished by
the use of a few bottles of nature's lifcj

Goukler, No. 668 Thirty-ninth street. West
Philadelphia. Pa., who sufTered for
months from severe nervous afflictions,
writes as follows:
"I beg leave to add my testimony to tna
wonderful good Paine's Celery Compound
has done me. Some months ago I was
troubled with a general breaking clown
oi the system. 1 I consulted a physician
without avail, and upon the auggestion of
Mr. â¢ John A, Coin, who I believe is a liv-
ing example of your wonderful curinar
medicine, I purchased two bottles of your
Compound, and I must say that I im-
proved wonderfully since the first dose.
My nervousness has left me entirely anÂ«l

The killing of the surplus female seals will
be an act of mercy, since it Â¦will put an end
at once to the extreme brutality of the pel
agic hunter's work. It will prevent the slow
torture to death by starving: of tens of thou
sands of helpless young which Is officially ob
served and counted every season by our agents,
under existing laws, and regulations. If we
do it, it Is but one killing, and then the work
is ended. If not done by us, then this infa
mous and cruel butchery of the female seals
and the starvation - of the young: by the pel
acic hunter will continue year after year in
the future, as it lias prevailed from year to
year since 1893, and will end only with the ex
termination of this seal life in the very near
iuture. .â¢
The report says that the young male
seals will be destroyed by 1906 and the
birth rate will cease on the breeding
grounds almost immediately thereafter.
The accompanying papers represent that
the seal herd has been reduced from
4.700,000 in 1S74 to. 224,000 at present, and
that the United States has spent $1,441,331

Stewart of Nevada deplored such, acts
of cruelty as had occurred in the Philip-
"The most shameful thing in this whole
transaction is the summoning of the au
thority of General Grant to justify the
order of General Smith." Â¦
He adverted to the references which
had been made to the acts of General
Grant during the Civil War and declared:
"This miserable doctrine of buying sov
ereignty with gold has cost us all this."
He referred to the cost of the war as
enough to establish universities like Har
vard throughout the country, and said:
"I do not charge these things upon the
army. I charge them upon Imperialism."
Hoar, after reviewing the situation in
the Philippines and -referring to the out
rages which had been committed, said: Â¦
HOAR AGAIN HEARD.
Mason of Illinois spoke, as he-said, for
the Filipinos. He referred to the case of
the Cubans, who had patiently waited the
pleasure of the United States for their. In
dependence.' If we gave- the Filipinos an
opportunity to try the art of self-govern
ment, said he, we still would retain tne
islands. He said he would not have voted
for the peace treaty but for the open and
notorious understanding among Senators
that there was to be a vote on a resolu
tion to. give to the Filipinos self-govern
ment as soon as In the opinion of the peo
ple of the United States they were equal
to the task. )
"Why not try it?" he asked. "It would
cost nothing. No harm can come from
an effort in that direction. Some of us
are tender and jealous as to what other
nations will say if we compromise with
this poor struggling people, but our re
public is strong enough to be independent
of the opinion of the nations of the world.
Our republic is righteous enough to do
right, regardless of what the other na
tions of the world may think or say."
Another amendment provided that here
after no corporation should be authorized

When evening: fell bright flames could
be sem flashing up. lighting the sky in
that direction. The ship's course out of
the inlet left the volcano directly to the
Vfslward. at which point. Losey says,
thpre seemed a continuous sheet of fire
r'ring. In the distance the column of
flame appeared to ascend but a few hun
dred feet into the air, but it probably was
runes high.
Psssc-nprers from Cooks Inlet, who ar
rivod to-day, confirm previous reports of
the eruption of Ri^doubt Volcano, which Is
situated on th<Â» west side, about forty
iv.i'es northwest of lliamna. Among thorn
was A. C. Lopcv of Tacoma. who has
been in the employ of the Trans-Alaska
Company, and who saw the eruption. He
railed from lliamna on the morning of the
Sin of May. From that point only heavy
smoke was to b<Â» seen in the direction of
Kedoubt. but this they knew meant that
the volcano was in eruption. Precipitous
mountains shut off the view until the
Cbtca ha<i traveled twenty miles or morn
on her trip up the inlet, when the scene
1'te::me thrilling. Dense black clouds
covered the entire region, spreading over
Ccoks Inlet, which at that spot is more
lban forty miles across. At times the
Eznoke directly over the volcano was
lighted to a dark gray, but no flames were
Eton during the day, and no ashes
re.Th^d the shin.
EKUPTION OF KEDOUBT.
"It was three days, after many peril
ors attempts, before I succeeded in
rt aching the base of the mountain. Then
1 discovered Â»hat the country for miles
around had been affected. The small un
dergrowth of trees had been entirely cov
ered by tho mass of matter from the vol
ccno. The streams that poured from the
top of the mountain were not even warm,
but seemed to consist entirely of dust,
recks and earthy substances. I stayed
<: r>. the spot only a couple of hours and
then left for the roast. As near as I can
learn, this mountain had never been con
sidered of a volcanic nature."
Suddenly the earth beneath my feet
shook; a low rumbling sound accom
panied the quaking. I glanced up at
luouiit Blackburn. It eeemed as if the
i<eak had opened and the points burst out.
A cloud of ashes and smoke shot into the
air several hundred feet, and there seemed
to How from the opening in the top a
stream of earthy matter, mixed with large
r.nd small bowlders. This continued for
about ten minutes, and then' ceased as
suddenly as it had begun. The air cleared
iiv.d then nature seemed again to wear
her cheery smile. â¢
PEAK'S TOP BTJKSTS OPEN.
SEATTLE, June 2.â Travelers arriving
from Alaska to-day report that two vol
canoes are belching flame, smoke and cin
ders in the northern Territory. One is
Redoubt Volcano, whose eruption was re
pcrted in dispatches to The Call some
tiiiys ago. ine other* is Mount Black
burn, which heretofore has been re
garded as an extinct volcano. The erup
tion of Mount Blackburn was sudden and
unexpected, and was witnessed, it is be
lieved., by but a single human being. His
story of the disturbance explains the
feories of earthquakes that jarred Alaska
6>iven weeks ago.
J. C. McFariand. a geologist, who was
ou an exploring trip, was within a few
miles of Mount Blackburn on April 11,
â¢when tho pent-up fury of the hidden
crater was let loose. In an interview on
fcis return to Skagway he gave the fol
lowing details of tne eruption:
"At 9:30 o'clock in the morning I was
just packing up my cooking utensils when
tho air about me suddenly became op
pressed by a distinct and uncommon s-i
leiice. In my wanderings through differ
ent woods 1 had become usea to any
fctrai:ge freaks of nature, but this one ap
palled me. 1 was in a rough, mountain

firemen will fall into line unless an eight
hour day is rranted.
F. J. Mullahey. State secretary and
treasurer of the Stationary Firemen's
L nion, to-night issued a statement, in
which he says:
The several bortherhoods of railroad
employes in this locality held a meeting
to-day, at which the general strike situ
ation was discussed. No action of any
kind was taken. The railroaders are in
hearty sympathy with the striking
miners.
Committees of the local unions were
busy to-night canvassing the men who
remained at work to-day. Hundreds of
them, however, cannot be reached, as
they are quartered within the- confines of
the collieries. There was quite a flurry
here to-day when it was learned that a
party of negroes had arrived over the
Jersey Central Railroad. It was learned
later that the negroes were only engaged
to cook for the non-union men "temporar
ily living in the collieries.
REMAIN IN THE MINES.
The small army* of coal and iron police
men which is in the field is not much in
evidence. The companies have instructed
the men to avoid trouble and that they
must not make themselves conspicuous.
Notwithstanding the large number of
men who were idle the coal fields were
very quiet all day.
Notwithstanding the big dÂ«>ertion of men
every colliery In the district which made the
effort was able to get up steam and maintain it.
President Mitchell's estimate is too high.
We have received estimates from all our col
lieries and the seneral superintendents ot all
the other coal companies, but they arc not to
be given out. as it would not be policy to
reveal our weak spots or to betray our strong
holds as far as they relate to the collieries
individually. 1 can say, however, that about
05 per cent of the Lehigh Valley's men, who
are scattered from near Scranton down to Sha
mokin, went out. The Delaware, Lackawanna
nnd Western, the Delaware and Hudson and
the Erie companies, whose operations are
mostly north of here, fared a little better.
The Susquehanna Coal Company's collieries,
which are controlled by the Pennsylvania Rail
road and which are lecated at Nanticoke, south
of here, were crippled less than any company
in the region. The Reading Company, with
forty collieries in the lower region, was the
worst sufferer, more than 70 per cent of itl
men refusing to go to work. The Individual
companies lost more than 50 per cent of their
men.
ESTIMATES ARE TOO HIGH.
On the other hand a mining official of
one of the largest coal companies made
this statement:
Reports received from every important min
ing community Indicate that where tne elgnt
hour day has not been conceded fully SO per
cent ot the firemen, pumpmen and . engineers
have ceased work. Tne number will be- ma
terially increased to-morrow. In some sections
mine foremen have positively retused to per
form the work of engineers, nremen and pump
men. In some places nremen have manned tne
pumps and clerks have also been required to
perform this labor. A penect army oi irre
sponsible men have been employed by the coal
companies to act as coal and Iron policemen.
The- services of these men are unnecessary and
their presence unwarranted. There have been
no violations to-day by the mine workers ,and
I am sanxuine there will be no overt acts on
the I>art ot the strikers.
WILKESBARRE. Pa., June 2.â The or
der of the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica calling out on strike all engineers,
firemen and pumpmen employed at col
lieries where the eight-hour work day
with present wages was not granted went
into effect to-day, and a majority of the
men obeyed the order. Neither side can
claim a victory at this time, because the
struggle on this phase of the anthracite
coal miners' strike has just opened. There
was only a partial showing of strength
to-day. The real test of whether or not
the mine pumps shall be manned will
begin to-morrow. Although a majority
of the men quit work, the companies,
generally speaking, succeeded in keeping
their pumps in operation. The operators
feel tnat they have the advantage, but
they are not so sanguine as to the fu
ture. The exact numDer wno quit worK
to-day coula not be ascertained. ,n;ach side

TUCSON, Ariz., June 2.â A courier ar
riving at Hermosilio and coming by way
of . Ures confirms the report that the
Yaquis have withdrawn from the coun
try contiguous- to Camou Mill and El
Tanque, and that they are assembling in
Mazatan Mountains in large numbers for
a second battle. A dispatch via Ures says
that the Yaquis have been reinforced by
400 Indian warriors, with Mausers, and
supplied with a large quantity of ammu
nition and provisions. The Yaquis have
recovered from the fight of May 23 since
being reinforced, and wish to again en
gage the Mexican soldiers.
The Mazatan Mountains are very
rough and the Indians will have a great
advantage, owing to their mode of war
fare. The battalion under command of
General Luis Torres has been reinforced
by a large contingent headed by Lorenzo
Torres, and the Mexicans will have the
advantage in numbers over the Indians.
The Yaquis are gathering in small
bands throughout the district, and it is
now repor^eu that they have 600 rnjen In
trenched in the foothills of Mazatan
Mountains. Many of the towns which
could spare men sent volunteers to the
aid of General Torres.
On Saturday a special train from Pes
quira arrived at Hermosillo, bringing
many families from towns and ranches;
in that neighborhood, who sought refuge
until the danger was. past. Numerous
bands of refugees continue to seek pro
tection in Hermosillo and the town is
crowded. On Friday night a volunteer
patrol service was organized under the
direction of Felipe Salido. a Government
engineer. Many of the militiamen organ
ized under the command of Simon Bley
have joined the regular forces and a sec
ond company was needed to guard the
surrounding ranches. The engineer had
no trouble in recruiting patrols, as the
citizens were eager to -join.
The excitement in Hermosillo has quiet
ed since the battle at El Tanque. owing
to the distance of the Yaqui forces. The
only immediate danger is from roving
bands. Mazatun 'Mountains are twenty
five miles from Hermosillo.

claims came up for hearing before Supe
rior Judge Hughes this afternoon. The
Legislature appropriated $270,000 for the
payment of claims against the State by
holders of coyote scalps. A bill appro
priating $5000 ior traveling expenses of
the Attorney General's office in defending
the suits against the State was vetoed by
Governor Gage, but when the suits were
about to come up in the Superior Court
of this county the Governor employed
Senator R. T. Devlin of this city to de

fice, represented by Deputy George A.
Sturtevant. resented the entrance of
counsel for Gage under the circum

called this afternoon Sturtevant said:
"I have the highest regard for Senator

The man who is caged in or cooped up

liver is the first organ which becomes
disordered, and constipation, biliousness,

one way to deal with liver "trouble" and
that is to go to the root of the disease,
and cure it once for all. Such cures of
the disordered or diseased liver almost
always follow the use of Dr. Pierce's

helps. It almost always cures. It reg-
ulates the liver, strengthens the stomach,

NEW YORK, June 2.â A Journal special
from Port of Spain, Trinidad, says: Alarm
has been caused here by the mud volcano
at'Piparo Hill, about forty miles from
this city, showing unusual ' activity. A
visit to the scene, made with considerable
difficulty, verifies to some extent the re
port of an eruption, and at the same time
satisfying the people that there is not
much immediate cause for alarm.
Loud reports and the opening of about
eight new vents, all at a season of the
year when it has never been known to
show activity, have caused even hitherto
unconcerned residents to feel the neces
sity of watching its behavior during the
approaching rainy season' with more than
ordinary anxiety.
PARIS, June 2.â An official dispatch

tions and is emitting cinders.
SALT LAKE, Utah. June 2.â Mose La
Fontise of Montana and Buddy King, the
Denver colored lightweight, fough't
twenty rather tiresome rounds to a draw
at the Salt Lake Athletic Club to-night.
La Fcntise rushed the fighting continu
ally after the ninth round, but could not
land effectively. King's superior reach
stood him in good stead. He Jabbed La
Fontise in the face almost at will, but his
blows lacked steam and did no . harm.
King had a badly puffed eye. Otherwise
neither man was marked at the end of
the contest.

PHILADELPHIA, June 2.â Charley Mc-

seconds before the gong sounded O'Brien
landed a right hook on the point of Mc-
Keever's jaw and the latter was carried
to his corner. He still had five seconds
In which to recover, but when time was
called for the second round McKeever

clared it A knockout.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 2.â The June
Grand Jury was sworn in to-day and in
structed by Judge O'Neill Ryan. The
Judge said: (
The Ariel Athletic Club will hold its reg
ular monthly boxing exhibition at
Mechanics' Pavilion Annex next Friday
evening.
The condition of Britt's hands makes
it practically impossible for him to keep
his intended engagement with George Mc-
Fadden. There was some talk about
Briit boxing McFadden before the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club the latter part of
this month, but the match will have to
be declared off. Britt is in need of a
rest and on the advice of his trainers
will po to Harbin Springs next Saturday
to recuperate. He may take a trip next
month to Portland and box Perry

Al Smith, the well known sportsman,
who is looking after Jack Roofs interests,
stated yesterday that he would bring Root
out here within five days and match him
apainst George Gardner and that he
would also bet $1000 on the side that Root
could again beat the Lowell boxer. Gard
rer and Root were to box in Carson on
July 4, but the match fell through. The
Century Club of Los Angeles is striving
to have the two men fight there on July 4.
Jimmy Britt is nursing a pair of hands
as a result of his tistic encounter with
"Kid" L-avigne last Friday night. Britt
landed time and again on Lavigne's hard
head and while he broke no bones his
"mitts" are swollen to twice their natural
eizt. Jimmy now uses a valet to dress
him. He cannot part his hair or lace
his shoes. His chief object in life at the
present time is "to stop friends from con
gratulating him with hearty shakes of
-the hand. As soon as Britt spies a friend
ccming with the avowed intention of
wringing his "mighty duke," Jimmy side
steps, places the injured member out of
danger and greets him. Many of his
friends thought Jimmy had become in
flated over his victory and felt hurt, but
es soon as it dawned on them that the
clever lightweight was suffering from
swollen hands, they changed their minO.
WASHINGTON, June 2.â Secretary Root
sent to-day. to the House a supplemental
report by Major O." F. \ Liong, the army
quartermaster, formerly in charge of the
transport service at San Francisco, an
swering the criticisms made by Colonel
Chamberlain, inspector general of the
army. Major Long declares that the
transports were purchased, chartered and
maintained in service as economically as
the conditions of war and emergency war
ranted: that millions were saved to the
Government by the methods pursued; that
while in a few isolated cases high prices
may have been paid, yet this was due to
urgent necessity and is offset by enormous
savings in other cases; that army regula
tions and business methods were followed ;
that the San Francisco business com
munity gave effective and patriotic sup
port to the Government and that reflec
tions on the community were unwarrant
ed by the facts; that as a whole all the
transactions of the transport service dur
ing the urgency period of the Spanish
war show infinitely more gain than loss.
I wish to inform you that I have abandoned
Christianity in all its forma and after care
ful and thoughtful study have embraced the
religion of Islam (Mohammedanism). lou
may be like some other Christians and thinK
that such will justify you in completely ostra
cising me and hating me -with a most beautiful
un-Chrlstian hatred. Do as you please. I have
got sense enough to know that I will get no
material benefits from my religion, but. In
stead, may be killed or allowed to starve to
death. All I want you to do if such a thing
happens anywhere near Santa Cruz Is
First not to allow any Christian rite to be
performed over my body, nor any Christian
minister to come even near my remains. In
the absence of one competent to conduct the
Mohammedan service, a Jewish Rabbi, or a
Unitarian minister. If they are quite handy,
otherwise nobody.
Second â No woman to touch me after I am
dead nor to have anything to do with my
burial. , .

ANNUAL COMMENCEMENT
S. H. Kent made a plea, supplemented
by Supervisor Comte, for the payment of
$2000 to the Park Panhandle Commission
ers, but the item was stricken out. The
sum of $5000 was ordered to be paid to
Martens and Coffey out of such fund as
the board may hereafter designate.
Braunhart's motion that $12,000 be set
aside out of the school fund for a chil
dren's playground north of Market street
was withdrawn after Wilson opposed it.
The board recommended that the Park
Commission expend $1500 to improve Co
lumbia square.
Assessor Dodge informed the board that
the assessment roll will slightly exceed
that of last year, when it was $413,000,00),
in spite of the fact that there would be
a loss of $6,000,000 on national bank stock
and several millions less on reduced as
sessments on old improvements. - Dodge
thought the actual tax collections would
be made on $405,000,000. . â¢*.
Wilson made a plea for the opening of
PETITION IS DENIED.
WOULD ABOLISH POSITION.
Commissioner Casey, would not say
whether or not he could perform the
duties of the Chief of the Bureau of
Streets in addition to his own. Casey
said that if the money was not provided
the Commissioners would certainly do the
work. Supervisor Wilson thought that if
Casey could fill the position another Com
missioner could do the work of the Super
intendent of Buildings and a large saving
could be effected. Casey said if more
work were imposed upon him he should
certainly insist that his colleagues do
more work. Casey also objected to item
izing the expenditures of the Board " of
Works and denied that the board is top
heavy as regards heads of bureaus and
employes. Manson said if he were given
charge of the streets he' could do as he
pleased without fear of being discharged.
The board then took up the budget,
item by item, and no objection was made
until the appropriation for $275,000 for pub
lic, lighting was reached, when Wilson
moved that $257,000 be set aside, but with
out success. Brandenstein objected to
$"8,Â«C0 being allowed for Recorder's copy
ists, and his motion that $26,000 be appro
priated was carried. â¢ ' i i ;
Supervisor Loughrey urged that $26,000
additional be allowed for firemen, so they
could get one day off in ten, but the item
was not allowed.
Supervisor Wilson's motion that the
item for the Bureau of Streets be restored
from $15,600 to $20,100, which would make
possible the retention of Street Superin
tendent Heath and Office Deputy Dono
van, was lost. McClellan's motion that
the amount be fixed at $17,700, which al
lows the retention of Donovan but en
compasses the dismissal of Heath, was
carried.
On Bent's motion the Health Board was
allowed $300 additional, with a recom
mendation that the salary of two dairy
inspectors be increased from $75 to $90 per
month.
Alpers' motion that $6000 allowed the
Bureau of Engineering for making private
lot surveys be eliminated was lost.
The Board of Supervisors 1 , after an all
day session, passed to print last night the
ordinance fixing the budget of expendi
tures for the municipal government^ for
the next fiscal year. The tax rate 'was
fixed at ?1 0762 on every $100 assessed valu
ation, including the appropriation for the
parks, which is outside the dollar limit.
Including the special levy of 15 cents for
new schools and a new hospital, the total
tax rate for city purposes will ' be $1 2262
per $100. The State tax will be ; in the
neighborhood of Â£>0 cents, so the grand
total rate will be in round numbers $1 75
per $100 valuation. The budget provides
for increased salaries - for a number of
positions and as a consequence but little
was left for permanent improvement-5.,
In fact an increased assessment roll is re
lied on to provide for urgent work on
streets and sewers.
At the afternoon session School Director
Roncovieri urged that the board appro
priate $45,000 in addition to the $1,220,000
decided upon, as there would be a $45,000
shortage in the school fund next year.
Brandenstein said the Supervisors desired
the Noe Valley school to be built out. of
the special levy for schools. Roncovieri
replied that, the Board of Education in
tended to build the school out of this
year's surplus. .
Chief of Police Wlttman pleaded for an
appropriation to pay one additional cap
tain, four additional lieutenants, seven
additional sergeants, ten additional cor
porals, and 600 patrolmen, or sixty-nine
in addition to the number recommended
by the Finance Committee.
J. Leo Park7 secretary of the Board of
Public Works, made an eloquent plea that
the salaries of several e'mployes be raistd,
which would necessitate the allowing of
$1140 in addition to $24,180 allowed for the
maintenance of the main office. Commis
sioner Manson declared that the abolition
of the position of Chief Heath of the
Bureau of Streets and Deputy A. J. Dono
van would seriously cnppie that depart
ment. Manson said the duties of the two
places could not be performed by the
Commissioners without neglecting consid
erable executive work.
Two petitions signed by property own
ers in the northern- section of the city
and by 000 employes of the Fulton Engi
neering and Iron Works at Harbor View
were hied with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday to grant the franchises for the
construction of electric roads in various
parts of the city as petitioned by the
United Railways.

An ordinance was passed to print order
ing the construction of a. sewer in Sixth
street, from Harrison to Bryant, at a cost
of 510,200, and the extension of Potrero
avenue sewer from Twenty-fifth street to
Army at an estimated cost of J5200.
The roadway of Potrero avenue, be
tvveen Twenty-first and Twenty-third

An ordinance was passed to print allow

Beard of Supervisors yesterday ordering
the repaving wtih bitumen of Hayes

"solvent credits (agents' accounts) $3,012,036,"
to be reassessed by me together with the real
estate. (Under numerous decisions tha high
est courts solvent credits in the hands of agents
who are empowered by their principal to col
lect and reinvest same have declared such
solvent credits to be taxable at the agent's
residence.) The sum on which the payment
of back taxes for 1S9G can be enforced amounts
to $843,996. This will bring Into the city
treasury over $13,000, which sum should have
been paid years ago, as there was no dispute
as .to the legality of the assessment on these
particular Items of. property.
Your honorable board is respectfully request
ed to direct the Tax Collector and Recorder to
cancel tax sale number seven hundred and
thirty (730), made July 3, 1897, as provided
in section 3S05, being assessment of 1896, vol
ume 2a, page 74, subdivision 10 of block 501,
Western Addition, assessed to Wells, Fargo &
Co., personal property franchise $10,000, fix
tures $5000. money $475,585, bonds $171,1VÂ»4,
solvent credits .$182,217, solvent credits (agents'
accounts) $3,012,030. All of the above named
personal property except the last named item.
It appears that the assessment made in 1890
by a previous Assessor of this county against
Wells, Fa-rKo & Co. was secured by a small
piece of reajty, not equal in value to the
amount of taxes due on said assessment. As
a result of this fact the taxes have never been
paid. After a thorough investigation of thlÂ«
matter I am satisfied that there Is a provision
In the general law by which these back taxes
can be collected. This Is possible through a
reassessment by this office for the current year
under the provision as laid down in the general
law.
In a communication Dodge explains how
Wells, Fargo & Co. has attempted to
avoid paying a large amount in taxes by
the petty subterfuge of selling to the
State a small piece of real estate. The
communication says:
Assessor Dodge submitted a resolution
yesterday to the Board of Supervisors di
recting the Tax Collector and Recorder
to cancel the tax sale whereby a lot at
Pine and Broderick streets, owned by
Wells, Fargo & Co., valued at $3000, was
sc--i ;t> the State in 1S97 for delinquent
taxes amounting to $13,000 The resolution
states that the property has f>een irregu
larly assessed for the year 1896 and directs
the Assessor to reassess and enter the un
collected taxes upon the assessment book
of 1902 to be collected as other taxes en
ttred thereon.
"I would favor a tax on every barrel
of whisky or barrel of beer," said Ruef
"which would be a graduated tax on
the amount of business done; but this
is not possible under tne charter. If you
want to raise 5120,000 for 100 more- police
men put a tax of ?500 per year on the
breweries, of which there are forty, and
a tax of $500 on wholesale liquor dealers
and you will have your $120,000. The brew
eries will willingly pay this license."
"This discussion has drifted , from the
business to the moral side." said Super
visor Boxton. "We need the money, and
some one told us that the saloon-keen
ers were the easiest to get it out of."
Ruef said that the raising of the license
would drive out 1000 saloons, so that the
necessity for an increased police force
would disappear, if it is true that this
necessity is caused by saloons. Ruef said
that he could produce $1,000,000 front in
terested parties if the saloons would be
restricted to 2000, with a- license tax of
$200 per year, as, the business would be
more concentrated with the lesser num
ber of saloons.
Police Commissioner Hutton said that
the. wholesale liquor dealers and fruit
stores selling liquors in excess of a. quart
were not under i the jurisdiction of the
Police Commission. J. T. Hurley said
that there are 2300 liquor stores paying
internal revenue licenses, but which pay
no city license. Hurley said if these paid
a license there would be plenty of money
for the Police Department.
Attorney Nagle said that the churches
should not be heard on the subject, as
they do not pay taxes. Dr. Larkin up
held that members of his congregation
paid more taxes than all saloons com
bined.
"I have always felt that the liquor deal
ers are not paying their just propor.
tion of taxes," said Rev. F. M. Larkin,
pastor of Grace "M. E. Â¦ Church, "for 75
per cent of the. crimes and the cost of
the Police Department is due to sa
loons. I rise to suggest that the ques
tion be put to a popular vote. I would
be willing to agitate the subject, Â«nd be
lieve that public education would mean
a restriction of the saloon trade." ' .
Alpers thought that the wholesalers
should be taxed in order to increase the
revenue, and deprecated the recommenda
tion of the Police Commission that drug
stores selling liquors pay a license of
$5 per quarter. Alpers said $15 per quar
ter would not be too much.
"A sudden raise in the license 'is cer
tainly a radical change in policy," said
D'Ancona, "and before so doing we
should be suro that we have the moral
support of the majority of the people.
If we are In need of more money to run
the city government we should certainly
ascertain the will of the people as to
the manner in which it should be raised."
WANTS WHOLESALERS TAXED.
D'Ancona said that the board has the
right to raise tho liquor license If it
deems it advisable.
Braur.hart stated that a Supreme Court
decision held that the' submission of an
ordinance to the people is unconstitutional
and that if the ordinance were so- adopted
the liquor interests would attack its le
gality. In reply, Ruef said that the prop
osition made by Connor to submit the
ordinance to the people had come with
surprising suddenness, but he did not
think that such a proceeding would be
illegal under the charter. Braunhart said
that after the terms of the ordinance had
been decided upon and had been adopted
by the people he desired to know if the
law would be accepted in good faith by
the liquor dealers. Ruef replied that he
thought it would be.
"If something is not done by this
board," said Connor, "the people will take
the initiative and vote for an ordinance
to raise the license. I am here to protect
the small liquor dealers, and we do not
want the liquor men to submit the ordi
nance. Eastern cities have license taxes
largely in excess of the rate in effect here.
The improvement -cIuTds are interesting
themselves in this matter and one of them
has even submitted an ordinance on the
subject." , i
Supervisor Eggers explained that the
$800 license in New York City was paid
not by the. small dealer, who was finan
cially unable to pay it, but by the big
breweries and wholesale liquor dealers.
LEGALITY OF ORDINANCE.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
dodged the proposal to increase the retail
liquor license to $200 per year and de
cided to take no action, but to leave the
point to be settled by a popular vote,
{supervisor Connor, who has constituted
himself the champion of the increase,
weakened at the supreme moment of in
troducing an ordinance on the subject.
Many retail liquor dealers were present to
protest against raising the license, and
arguments were presented by seveal at
toneys.
Yvhen the debate began Connor ex
pressed himself as willing to witnaraw ail
proceedings 1Â£ me issue wouia De suo

Protective Association, said his clients
were ptrtectly wining to submit the ques
tion to a popular vote. Ruef said that
liquor dealers paid more than their just
proportion of taxes and would- pay the
special tax for schools and hospital with
good grace.
"Why should this one particular trade
be tax"ed to the verge of suppression,
asked Kuef, "in the guise ot raising a
sanall revenue? You are willing to sacri
llce a thousand small liquor dealers be
cause some of the larger dealers are sat
isfied to pay the increased license. If it
is a question of determining whether we
shall have saloons, 1 am willing that the
people should pass upon it. Consider the
wholesale liquor dealers or the large
breweries in imposing an increased license
and do not put all the burden o_n the
small dealer. You would not get much
additional revenue by raising the license,
considering the suppression of the many
small saloons."
The report in the San Francisco- papers
that the supposed murderer Hadley had
taken a steamer for the antipodes and
lnight have stopped here is not credited
by the local police. High Sheriff Brown
received a circular giving notice that
iiadley was wanted some time ago and
has been keeping a lookout for him.
The Rev. Alfred Willis, for more than
thirty years Bishop of Honolulu, leaves
this week for Tonga Islands, where he
will establish the Anglican church and
will probably remain in charge thereof.
By a vote of the Hawaiian Synod the
prayer books and hymnals that have long
beer, used in St. Andrew's Cathedral
r.ere have been turned over to the Bishop,
who will take them to Tonga. American
prayer books and hymnals are to be used
here in future.
It is said that Circuit Jutige Humphreys
of the First Circuit Court may be a can
didate for Delegate to Congress in the
election next November. Some of the
liome rulers favor nominating him, and
i:e has the support of one element among
ihe Republicans. James H. Boyd, Super
intendent of Public Works, is also being
lilscussed as a candidate. The present
Delegate. R. W. Wilcox, is expected back
here by the end of next mouth, and he
will probably make a fight for another
nomination.
HONOLULU. H. T.. May 27.â The

island trade, was searched by United
States Marshal Hendry last Saturday
xiight under a search warrant secured by
Collector of Internal Revenue Chamber

Lydia Â£V Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
It will entirely cure the worst forms of Female Complaints, all Ova-
rian troubles, Inflammation and Ulceration, Falling and Displacement
of the "Womb, and consequent Spinal Weakness, and is peculiarly
adapted to the Change of Ldfe.
It has cured more cases of Backache and Leucorrhcea than any
other remedy the world has ever, known. It is almost infallible in such
cases. It dissolves and expels tumors from the Uterus in an early stage
of development, and checks any tendency to cancerous humors.
Irregular, Suppressed or Painful Menstruation, Weakness of the
Stomach, Indigestion, Bloating, Flooding, Xervous Prostration, Head-
ache, General Debility quickly yields to it.
Womb troubles, causing pain, weight, and backache, instantly re-
lieved and permanently cured by its use. Under all circumstances it
acts in harmony with the laws that govern the female system, and is as
harmless as water.
It quickly removes that Bearing-down Feeling, extreme lassi-
tude, "don't care" and " want-to-be-lef t-alone " feeling, excitability,
irritability, nervousness, Dizziness, Faintness, sleeplessness, flatulency,
melancholy or the " blues," and backache. These are sure indications
of Female Weakness, or some derangement of the Uterus, which this

TAMALPAISâ T., City. Tamal-pals
means country of the tamals. In the early
days of California there was a tribe of
Indians that were called Tamals by some
and Tomales by others. They inhabited
what is now Marln County and Tamalpais
was a designating term for the country
they occupied. A good many years ago
an individual of poetic fancy evolved out
of his own mind "an Indian legend" in re
gard to Mount Tamal-pals based upon an
idea that viewed from a certain point the
crest of the mountain of which the mount
named is the extreme eastern end rep
resents the form of a woman at rest and
he wrote a poem for one of the news
papers in which he told a tale of love and
that the heroine died and formed part of
the mountain chain. That is about all
there is to the legend of the "sleeping
beauty" in connection with Tamalpais.

PERSONAL MENTIOiN.
If the error is the faufc: of a careless reporter, or a
trick of cable transmission, then we withdraw our
remarks; otherwise we stand for loyalty to the
King's English and in defense of that good old verb
of such respectable Anglo-Saxon pedigree that it to
this day expresses the Anglo-Saxon genius for fall
ing upon and seizing everything in sight.
Bacon and Shakespeare, and certainly Tennyson,
would have said, "Then I would better leave my seat
vacant at the banquet," and the King would have
gladly answered, "Yes, you would better leave it
vacant."
The verb transitive "to have" means possession;
in its primary sense to fall on, to rush upon and
seize. "Had" is its past participial form, meaning
"fallen on, rushed upon and seized." Now did his
Lordship mean to say, "I rushed upon, fell upon and
seized better leave vacant my seat at the banquet?"
Have, cr had, carmot be used as an auxiliary verb in
such a sentence, because they imply possession.
Perhaps the King, though angry with his Prime
Minister, desired to be royally polite by not calling
attention to this misuse of his own tongue, and
therefore replied in the same defective English.
Another respectable company of the children of
men are interested in the tiff because of their re
spect for the mother tongue. The King had spread
a banquet, not a tiffin, but a full meal, to which
Lord Salisbury was invited with an R. S. V. P. card.
When the tiff occurred between the Minister and
the monarch the Minister said, "Then I had better
leave my seat at the banquet vacant," and the mon
arch answered, "Yes, you had better leave it vacant."
Shakespeare said of an ancestor of the Prime Min
ister, "Now lift up thy brow, Â«renowned Salisbury!"
The current generation of readers of Shakespeare
may well cry out, "'Now lift up thy grammar," to his
descendant. The English verb has rights which
Ministers and monarchs must respect.
the promotion of favorites. It is a revelation of the
difference between the British sj r stem and* ours.
The Eresident of the United States has the nominat
iilg power, but cannot appoint without the consent of
the Senate. The Prime Minister, who is chairman
of a parliamentary committee called the Ministry,
has the nominating power, without which the King
cannot appoint. Positions are reversed. Our Presi
dent is in the shoes of the Prime Minister, and the
King lines up with our Senate. We respect him
highly. He is the head of a great and friendly
power, and it is not our fault if he is the analogue
of our peculiar and sometimes tempestuous Senate,
where members cufi each other's ears and fling de
fiance, like noise from a buzzsaw. All that change
comes of the revolution of 1688 and the progress in
parliamentary government since the days of Wal
pole.
PART of the world was interested in the report
that Edward VII and his Prime Minister,
Lord Salisbury, have had a tiff. The tiffing
between them was caused by the refusal of Salisbury
to present for the peerage a friend of the King
whom he desired to favor by that promotion. This
is information to many who have supposed that the
King was as independent as his predecessors, the
Stuarts, Tudors and Plantagenets, in the matter of

While each side will of course assert a sanguine ex
pectation of a sweeping victory, it is clear the con
test is going to be a closeone. It is to be a battle
over new issues, and no' one can foresee how the
people will divide upon them. Republicans can af
ford to take no risks, and here in California every
thing should be done to return a solid Republican
delegation. , â¢ ' *
The gerrymandering of districts is not expected to
cut much figure in the contest. One of the most
careful calculators of the outlook says: "It is a no
table fact that not since the war had, so many North
ern Legislatures been in Democratic hands as^vvhen
the apportionments were made under the census of
1890, and yet in no decade since the war have the Re
publicans carried such a series of Congresses as in
the present one. This looks as if gerrymanders re
acted on their makers, and, while this is not exactly
true, it may be recalled that issues often come on so
t;nexpectedly as to upset all calculations and to ren
der of no effect platw^of this sort. The Republicans
are now in, control of nearly every Northern Legis
lature and have in most instances cut up the States
to suit themselves. It remains to be seen w*hat the
Democrats can do in these new lines of battle." .
To offset those gains, however, the Republicans
expect to win seats now occupied by Democrats in
Illinois, Ohio and New^York.. Their chances of
makinf, such gains are fully as good, to say the least
of the:n, as are the Democratic chances of winning
in Pennsylvania or Indiana. . .
Hardly any gain can be expected in New England.
New York promises little. In fact, some of the seats
now held by Democrats in that State may be lost to
Democracy. On r the other hand, Pennsylvania poli
tics is in such a shape that there is a showing for one
or two Democratic gains in that State, and it is be
lieved that one or more may be gained in Indiana.
At the present time .Republicans^ have two mem
bers from Missouri, two from North Carolina, two
from Tennessee, three from Kentucky a"nd six from
Marylandr It is not believed they can hold all of
those seats ..in the. next Hc^ise,.,, Probably .qftih^fif I

majority.. At the' present time .the Democrats have
168 members, of whom 118 are from the Southern
States and 50 from the North and West. To get
control of the next House they must gain 26 mem
bers. The question, as to where the needed seats are
to be gained is that which is .now occupying the at
tention of campaign committees of both parties.
Setting aside these assertions of the different par
ties as equally unreliable, some experts have begun
close figuring on the prospects of "the -campaign.
There will be. 386 Representatives, elected, and of
course 194 members will be required to have a bare
While admitting that the Democrats have a good
fighting chance by reason of the usual ebb and flow
in the strength of parties, Republican leaders main
tain that the party will "continue its control of the
House, Their argument is that there is nothing in
the present situation to render the supporters of the
party in 1900 discontented either with the Govern
ment or with Congress, and consequently there will
be no such gain to the Democratic ranks as , san
guine Democrats expect; ..
WASHINGTON politicians have begun giv
ing out estimates of the probable results of
the Congressional elections. It is conceded
by all that the Democrats will have a good chance to
win by reason of the tendency of the administration
party to break away at elections in off years. Since
Grant's second inauguration the House elected at
the middle of a Presidential term has been opposed
to the administration in every case except in the
first terms of Cleveland and McKinley. Basing their
hopes upon an expectation of a repetition of the
course of politics In the past, the Democratic lead
ers assert that as their party is now free from the
blight of Byyanism it will gain accessions from all
who are discontented with the administration and
control the next House by a good majority.

The refusal of the House to retire Gen
eral Sternberg with an advancement to

bill to lie over until it comes up under

that time General Sternberg will have his
retirement, as his time under the age
limit expires June 8.

Grosvcnor of Ohio, who was in charge of

Only forty-six Democrats voted against
the resolution.
I say that the man selected to deliver the

country entertained for him, and proudly enter
tained, would not have dared to undertake to
deliver a political address when he was speak

President. (Applause.) .
I had the honor to be appointed on the

resolutions in honor of our deceased President,
Mr. McKinley, and to select an appropriate
speaker to deliver the eulogy on that occasion.
I accepted the position and united In the se

deliver the eulogy. I listened with great care
and attention to the address delivered by Mr.
Hay. I think I am as keenly alive to every
thing that affects the interests and the honor
and the welfare of the Democratic party as my
friend from Missouri, but from whom I en
tirely dissent on this occasion. I listened to
that address with great care, with great cau
tion and even with a disposition to criticize if
anything wrong had been said. Put I failed
to detect in the whole of that address anything
that I thought was improper to be said or any
thing said in a party spirit. And I feel sure
that If the man selected for the great duty of
speaking on that occasion the sentiments of
the American people had dared to inject into
his address anything that was an appeal to
party spirit and party sentiment, the shade of
our great President, breaking the cerements
of the tomb, would have appeared before him
and at once challenged his utterances. Any
man who would have made here on such an
occasion a speech political In its character
would in doing so have dishonored the memory
of McKinley' s great absence of partisan feel

ing the tax rate, must be passed by a
unanimous vote of the Supervisors and
approved by the Mayor. I repeat that it
has been the almost universal opinion and
understanding of taxpayers that the
Supervisors could not and would not ex
ceed tbe dollar limit rate of taxation ex
cept in a case of emergency.
HOT AN EMERGENCY CASE.
Emergency, according to Webster, is "a
condition of things appearing suddenly or
unexpectedly; an unforeseen occurrence;
a sudden occasion." Are the Supervisors
meeting any such emergency with this
proposed increase in taxes? I fail to sea
it. On the contrary, they are only creat
ing one for the coming year. The amount
they contemplate raising thl3 year will
create an unfinished hospital and a num
ber of uncompleted school buildings. And
then we will have a genuine emergency
to meet and more taxes to pay.
There v l3 one consoling thought which
will -probably bring some relief to prop
erty owners, which is that the taxes paid
under the 15-cent additional levy will be
returned to them through the courts. I
air convinced of this fact because I am
not a lawyer, and hence it is difficult to
persuade me that the freeholders who
framed the charter meant to build school
houses and other public buildings by di
rect taxation in excess of the dollar
limit or Â«se why did they say (article
XVI, section 29): "When the Supervisors
shall detefminÂ©, that the public interest
requires the construction or acquisition
of any' permanent municipal buuaing or
improvement the cost of which In addi
tion â¢ to the other expenses of the city
and county "will exceed the income and
revenue for any one year they must by
ordinance passed by the affirmative vote
of not less than fourteen members of the
board submit a proposition to incur a
bonded indebtedness for such purpose to
the electors of the city and county at a
special election to be held for that pur
pose only," etc.
SHOTJIiD BE A BOND ISSUE.
If this is not a direct requirement to
construct schools and a hospital only by
issuing bonds unless they can be built
within the dollar limit I would like to
know what it means.
The papers have been full of "public
sentiment" articles lately, and "universal
demand" editorials for school buildings
and a new hospital, and I think the Su
pervisors are being misled by them.
There are thousands of taxpayers in this
city who would voice their protests
against this increase of taxes . if they
thought it would avail them anything by
doing so. They don't, because it is trou
blesome and to many it is embarrassing
to make complaints in public. The pres
ent administration has the confidence of
the people, and I have no desire or in
tention of harshly criticizing the Super
visors. I think they are trying to earn
and merit the approval of their constitu
ents and to deal justly with taxpayers.
But I am satisfied they will regret this
"emergency tax" if they pass the or
dinance. There might be some justifica
tion for placing an elastic construction
upon the tax provisions in the charter
if the revenue of San Francisco could not
be increased sufficiently to provide means
for conducting the city government and
also construct the hospitals and schools.
But, ss it can, there is no excuse for levy
ing any additional tax above the $1 rate.
The method is simple, and is the same
employed by other cities, namely, to sup
port their public departments from the
receipts of saloon â¢ licenses instead of
throwing the whole burden on the tax
payers, which is practically what is done
here. The city of Buffalo collects *600,
000 more every year from this source than
we do. The license there is $500 per an
num. Here, in a city of about the same
population, it is only JS4.
CITY'S LOW LIQUOR LICENSE.
San Francisco-haa the lowest liquor^ li
cense of any city in the Lnlted States.
As a result, there are twice as many sa
loons as there would be with a WÂ» li
cense. Considering the fact that nearly
55 per cent of the arrests during the year
are for drunks, the saloons should con
tribute toward the support of the Police
Department the same proportion which
other orojrressive cities demand and col
fect l/?S "ere done fully SOO.000 could
be spared for schools and other improve
ments, and within a few years the "emer
eencv" which the Supervisors are now
trvin- to meet would cease to exist, while
the rate of taxation would be left whera
m now is and should remainâ Â» on the

Editor The Call: From present appear
ances tho Board of Supervisors will on
Monday unanimously vote an additional
levy of IVt cents to provide, a fund with
which to commence. the construction of a
new City "and County Hospital and a lika
amount to commence the building of new
schoolhouses. :.". V;;-- Â¦* ..
There are not many who. Question tna
desirability of better schoolhouses and
mere of them, and the majority of citi
zens accept as correct the oft-repeated
statement that the City and. County Hos
pital Is a disgrace to the city. Like most
of those who know nothing about the hos
pital I am In favor of building a new one
and I am quite sure that the present
schools are inadequate and doubtless
some of them are unsafe. And so I ad
mit there is at least some ground upon
â¢which the Supervisors have based the
proposed ordinance and under which tney
intend to Increase taxes 15 per cent.
Is the ground sufficient and are they
complying with the charter? I don't
think so. Article 3, chapter 1. section 11,
requires the Supervisors to fix the tas
levy on or before the last Monday in
June, the rate exclusive of sinking fund
ar.d interest and the cost of maintaining
parks and squares "shall not exceed the
rate of one dollar on each one hundred
dollars valuation of the property as
sessed." Here is a direct prohibition
against any rate of taxation In excess of
the dollar limit. It was the safeguard
which the charter surrounded taxpayers
with, and the protection offered them tra
der the new organic law. Only upon ex
traordinary or unusual occasions was this
limitation to be disregarded. Section 13
of the same chapter quoted above says:
"The limitation in section 11 of thla
chapter upon the rate of taxation shall
not apply in case of any great necessity
or emergency. In such cases the limita
tion may be temporarily suspended so as
to enable the Supervisors to provide for
(The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column., but pre
sents them for whatever value they may nave
as communications of general Interest.)
. The Prison Directors have an opportunity to
prove that they are free from other responsibility
than careless discharge of their duty, and the State
will not deal with them harshly for frank admission
of that fact. But what are they going to do, and
when and how?
We are not to be accused of insisting that the
Warden shall be niggardly in entertaining the Gov
ernor of the State, or the Prison Directors. The
people do not want that. But the people do not
expect that the means of such entertainment shall
be falsified by forged bills and be charged off as
prison clothing or jutemill supplies. The people
would not wince at open and true bills for luxuries
used in such entertainment, in the line of victuals
and drink, for the people are hearty and do not de
mand asceticism in their officers. But they want
honesty and frankness. The people, again, do not
criticize their officers for refinement of surroundings.
They are entirely willing that the Governor should
sleep on a bedstead de luxe and that Prison Direct
ors shall feed from a fine table, Uut they don't want
them to be illegally manufactured by prison labor,
of material charged and paid for by the State, as jute
mill supplies or cement sidewalk.
The Call has done its duty. It has secured the
testimony and has put its most important parts out
of the reach of concealment or destruction. It is
not our fault if this evidence hit the Warden, the
Governor or the Prison Directors. It is their fault
if they have taken the risk and incurred the liability.
That evidence shows that when the administration of
Warden Aguirre was in the green stick it began to
violate the law concerning prison industries, and in
the dry it has become responsible for false vouchers
and sophisticated bills.
times. That refusal is an "act-" of insubordination
which should have been promptly dealt with. \ It
should have been reported to the Governor, and he,
the executive of the State, -charged with the faith
ful enforcement of the law, should have at once com
pelled obedience to that order and have rebuked or
punished its refusal. The best guaranty of fidelity
in the discharge of official duty is publicity and unre
stricted access to the public records. In its parti
san aspect there is a division of responsibility. That
is one of the dangers in all bi-partisan control of
public affairs. It was the favorite method of Tweed,
when he led Tammany, and succeeded always in get
ting Republican partnership in his schemes of
spoliation. Experience has proved that bi-partisan
partnership always needs watching. The people of
California are doing the watching. What are the
watched doing? â¢
The president of the directory has not resented the
refusal of the prison authorities to respect his offi
cial order for an exhibition of the prison books,
which are public records, open to inspection at all
As far as the offenses at San Quentin are concerned
they are in such variety, so complex, and involve so
many, and yet are so interwoven, that they constitute
a whole and complete structure of violation of law.
The people are as well able to judge of the force of
the testimony, as are the Directors. Therefore the
difficulties which beset those officers are many.
What are they going to do about it? They cannot
remain idle and indifferent. That will be official sui
cide, and suicide is confession. Their delay creates
a widespread suspicion that time is being given to en
able the guilty to sophisticate a case. , . .
These occurrences have passed under the noses of
the Prison Directors. What are they going to do
about it? They may plead limitation of their in
quisitorial powers. They may take shelter under
their lack of judicial function to issue writs and com
pel attendance of witnesses. They may appreciate
how closely these acts graze their official personal
ity and flinch from the scars that they would bear
if the truth were demonstrated. They may be among
the beneficiaries of these unlawful proceedings and
therefore be not only legally disqualified from acting
as investigators of themselves, but they may feel
that, no matter how liberal their use of whitewash,
the effect on public opinion will not be exculpatory.
At San Quentin the indisputable evidence is dis
closed that convicts run the business of the prison,
and that, being under the absolute personal control of
the Warden, other convicts have by him been ordered
to engage in pursuits, which are unlawful, using raw
material therein which. is the property of the State,
and that the Warden and his friends and relatives,
official and otherwise, are the beneficiaries of this
unlawful manufacture. This would be illegal even
if the State were reimbursed for the material used.
Whatever opinion one may have of the economics
involved in the statute which forbids all industries in
that prison except the manufacture of jute web and
sacks, it is the law of California, which all- con
cerned must obey. Therefore the surreptitious
manufacture of furniture and harness by 'prison laboÂ£Â»
is unlawful, and, being done by the order and with
the knowledge of the Warden, is in violation of his
official oath and obligation. If the State is not
compensated for the use of its property, the act con
stitutes embezzlement of the property of the State.
If that property is billed as something else than what
it really is, and is paid for by the State, the crim
inality is increased by. the presentation of a false
and forged voucher, which is also a criminal offense
denounced as a felony. . Â¦ . .

intention' to make the prison administration non

cations go. The Warden of San Quentin is a Repub
lican, and the Warden of Folsom is a Democrat.
Both are under fire,. The Folsom officer is accused
of subordinating the guards and the public employes
and officers of the prison to the domination of fa

SCIENCE SCORES AGAIN.
A Preparation That Will Destroy the
Dandruff Germ Discovered.
Finally the scientific student has dis-
covered a certain remedy for dandruff.
When it first became known that dan-
druff is the result of a germ or parasite
that digs into the \calp and saps the vi-
tality of hair at the root, causing' falling
hair and baldness, biologists set to work
to discover some preparation that will
kill the germ. After a year's labor in
one laboratory the dandruff germ de-
stroyer was discovered, and It Is now-
embodied in Newbro's Herpicide, whicb,
besides curing baldness and thinning hair,
speedily and permanently eradicates dan-
druff. "Destroy the cause, you remove
the effect."

One of Judge Pierce's legs was disabled,
and he was unable to walk. He man
aged, however, to crawl to a. convenient
place, where he made a fire, by which he
remained until found next day. He was
removed to Jolon, where he has since
been confined. It is thought that he
sustained a fracture of the thigh bone
or a broken hin joint.

The decree of the Circuit Court of the
district of Oregon was affirmed in the
Cfise of the X. K. Fairhank Company vs.
Luckel Ring and Cake Soap Company.
Under all the circumstances of the case we
are of the opinion that the carrier is not re
lieved from liability as to the delivery of
freight and baegage by reason of tha language
in the contracts that the landing should not
be deemed a nart of the voyage. The cus
tom and usage of landing passengers on a
bleak shore without delivery of their baggage
and effects until after the ship goes to other
places tf> deliver other freight and remains
away for a week or more, if such custom ex
isted, is one that should be more honored in
the breach than in the observance, and should
not be sanctioned or encouraKed by the
courts.
The decree of the District Court of
Washington, northern division, was af
lirmcd, with costs, in the case of John
T. Urismore and others vs. the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company. Grismore and
ins fellow complainants were awarded
*2700 damages in the lower court and the
defendant appealed. The suit was a libel
against the steamship Valencia for breach
ot contract for the transportation of
pi::intifl"s and baggage from San Fran
cisco to Nome. They alleged that they
Lad paid $75 each for second class pas
sage in the season of 1900, but instead of
receiving second class food and accom
modations they were treated and fed as
steerage passengers and their baggage
was detained ten days after they were
landed at Nome. In rendering its opinion
the court says:
It is contrary to fundamental principles to
permit Jurois to receive evidence without the
liresecce of the defendant. They must and
can only iTouerly ueeide the question of his
t:uilt or innocence ujjon evidence, introduced at
the trial. Whether or not the can admitted
in c\ iaenee contained opium prepared tor
smoking- purposes was a question of fact upon
which both tides were entitled to be heard â
the defense as well as the Government. Judg
ment reversed and cause remanded for new
trial.
Jn commenting upon this instruction of
the District Judge the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals says:
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
reals handed down an opinion yesterday
to the effect that it is not proper for a
jury to receive evidence in the absence of
the defendant. The case was that of the
United States vs. William Wilson and T.
P. Hodgson. The defendants were con
victed In the District Court for the north
ern district of Washington of having re
ceived and concealed smuggled opium
that had been prepared for smoking. On
the trial of the case the District Judge
instructed the jury that they could take
a tin of opium, punch a hole in it and
ascertain whether it contained opium
prepared for smoking. This tin had been
admitted in evidence, but it had not been
opened to allow of an examination of its
contents.
An appeal in a case under quo warranto
proceedings does not act as a stay of
judgment. Anticipating that Judge Sloss
will decide against him, Fredrick is pre
paring to turn over the clerk's office and
all the records and documents appertain
ing thereto.
Attorney A. Ruef, acting for Fred
rick, the Mayor's appointee to the of
fice, is of the opinion that, as Judge
Sloss has already decided that his cli
ent is not entitled to the clerkship, it
would be useless to fight the present case
before him. For this reason Ruef agreed
to ask for judgment without making any
argument. Judge Sloss will, in all prob
ability, sustain their former ruling and
decide that Fredrick is a usurper. An
appeal will immediately be taken from
this decision.
"When the case involving the title to
the office of Chief Clerk of the Justice
of t"he Peace courts came up under quo
warranto proceedings yesterday morning
before Judge Sloss, McComb and Fred
rick, the claimants of the office, both
requested that it be laid over until this
morning. The contestants have agreed
to submit the case without argument.
The delay was sought in order to afford
the attorneys - time to prepare a state
ment of the facts commencing at the
beginning, when Williams was ejected,
and recounting all the subsequent de
velopments, legal and otherwise. This
statement will be submitted. to the court.
Mr. Eamiine saM. that he would go be
fore the Grand Jury to-day and procure
the reinclictment of the defendants on
charges of having procured false oaths
from other persons than those named in
the defective indictment.
Mrs. Elizabeth Little, a chambermaid
cf Loyalton. Sierra County, was the next
â¢witness, and it vras while she was on the
Staiid that the denouement came. She
testified that on Iilay 11 of 1001 she filed an
application for a tract ansl took the oath
before II. M. Mallech. Receiver of the
Land Department at Marysville. Ths in
dictment charged that she had taken the
oath before Frank \Y. Johnson, the Reg
ister. Therf wore similar fatal variances
aHl througn the indictments.
WRONG PERSONS NAMED.
Agent Cullom, who is a brother of
tniied Slates Senator Cuhom, was de
tailed by the Liuiu JJepartmenl to prepare
the eviuence in the case. The original ap
plications, which were to be prouueed by
the prosecution during the trial, were
cent on to Washington and were not re
turned to the United States Attorney's
office in this city until yesterday morning
wn.iie the trial was In progress. Mr. Cul
lom supplied the facts on which the case
%vas presented before the Granll Jury and
en which the indictments were drawn.
When the applications were opened in
court yesterday it was ftjund that the
fciieged false oaths had been taken before
persons other than those named in the
indictment. Karly in the day Bert Schles
inger of counsel tor the defense demurred
tc the indictment on the ground that it
6id not allege certain knowledge en Che
part of the defendants and the persons
vhem it was charged were associated
vith them, but Judge de Haven ruled that
there was no merit in the point raised
and the case went on. William E. Lang
don, a country butcher, testified that he
liad taken up 100 acres and afterward sold
the tract to Cantain Roberts of Sacra
mento. He made $1<W and expenses on
the deal and did not consider that he had
dene anything unlawful. Having pur
chased the land from Government, he
thought that he had a right to sell it to
whomsoever he pleased.
HOW BLUNDER OCCURRED.
The case was that of the United States
vs. J. M. Kngle, a real estate agent; Wil
liam S. Lewis, a. lumber merchant; S. VY.
Keddie, a surveyor; A. S. Parsons, an ex
minister of the gospel, and Julian E. Par
dee.
They were indicted for subornation of
perjury in having induced a large number
of persons to rue upon timber lands in
pjumas, Lasseu ana Sierra counties, by
â¢which means the defendants are alleged
to have secured about ten thousand acres
of valuable timber. The prosecution had
obtained testimony to the effect that the
persons who were induced to make ihe il
legal application were paid their expenses
Â£ud one hundred dollars each.
The prosecution of the Sierra and Plumas
timber land grabbing cases came to an
inglorious end yesterday afternoon in the
United States District Court by the dis
covery that H. C. Cullom, special agent
for the United States Land Office, had
procured the indictment to be drawn so
that one thing was alleged while another
tiling was proved. As soon as this dis
covery was made First Assistant United
Elates Attorney Banning announced that
the prosecution had no case. Judge de
Haven instructed the jury to render a
verdict of acquittal, which was done be
fore the jury left the box.
Prosecution's Witnesses F^il
to Substantiate the
Allegations.

Madeleine Lucette Ryley evidently had
Maude Fealy in mind when she wrote
"My Lady Dainty." The star at the
Grand Opera-house is certainly a dainty
little person, and a clever actress, and the
authoress in this particular play has af
forded Miss Fealy ample opportunity to
display Her versatility.- Last night at the
end of the second act the audience was
so pleased that the curtain had to be
raised to give It a second glimpse of tbe
Grand Opera-House.
The ninth week of "Fiddle Dee Dee" at
Fischer's Theater was opened last evening
with a crowded house. The" fun-makers

formance. The singing and dancing were
good. All the work was abreast of. that
of previous evenings. The signs lead to
the conclusion that Fiddle Dee Dee" la
good to run just as long as the manage
ment sees fit to keep it on.

"The Sidewalks of New York," a cyclo
nnna of city life, illuminated by charac
ters found on the streets of the metropo
lis, was presented at the Central Theater
last evening. The play is full of sensa
tional and spectacular features. Comedy
in the slums and .tragedy in the mansions
of the rich are depicted. High dives are
made into the East River and rescues are
made in the latest approved style. The
members of the company are right at
home in this melodrama. Specialties are
numerous and add to the interest in the
play. Reyna Belasco, aged six, aston
ished the audience by her wonderful buck
and wing and clog dancing; the Paloma
quartet, composed of young ladies ren
dered catchy airs, and "Billy" Bray ren
dered some "ragtime" melodies. The
whole strength of the Central company
is enlisted in the production, and the
character parts are all in good hands
Earle Brown, as the banker's secretary'
is the hero, and. Fanny Mclntyre, wife of
the bankers wayward . son, the heroine
James Corrigan is especially effective &k

A well, arranged programme entertained
large audiences at the Chutes at both
performances yesterday. Jeanette Lau
relle presented a serpentine revolving
pedestal dance, a novelty never before
staged and one that is bound to make a
big Eastern ancr European hit. The light
and picture effects in the act are beautiful
and ingenious. Dooley and Fowley are
capital black face comedians and sing and
dance in a way that, compels encores.
Luella Montague's educated cats display
wonderful intelligence, and the Lamonts
give a neat parlor acrobatic act. Bacon
and Vane, operatic sigers; Davis and De
Hearde, colored comedians, and the ani
matoscope, with a new assortment of
moving pictures, complete the bill. Col
onel Edward Beaupre. the tallest man on
earth, continues to be a great attraction.
A big surprise is in store for Thursday,

Prince of Monaco Secures Separation
PARIS, June 2.â A dispatch received
this afternoon from Monaco confirms the
report published by the Petit Journal this
morning that at the instance . of the
Prince of Monaco the courts of, the prin

tion of the Prince and Princess of Monaco,
who formerly was Alice, Dowager Duch

in strong lines for Miss Kidder and she
makes the most of them. Had Mr. Syle
and the great French novelist collaborated
with the idea of writing a one-role play
for Miss Kidder they could not have suc
ceeded better. Her speeches are long, and
she delivers them with dramatic fire.
Alcazar.
The last week of the clever stock com
pany at the Alcazar was commenced last
night, when the well-known comedy
"His Wife's Father" was presented. The
selection was a happy one, as each of the
characters was admirably suited to the
member portraying it. The play is a
satire upon the father-in-law, who can
not understand why his daughter should
care more for her husband than for him
and meddles in the young couple's affairs
till a serious estrangement ensues be
tween them and he is brought to his
senses. George Osbourne, as Buchanan
Billings, the father, was all that could
be desired. He was honored with several
deserved curtain calls. M. L. Alsotr, as
his son-in-law, was most effective, and
played the part with rare Judgment and
discretion. Howard Scott, as Billings'
sensitive brother-in-law. and Henry.
Shumer, as his son, were excellent. Frank
Bacon did a clever -piece of character
work as Matt, the faithful servant.
Marion Convere was sprightly and charm
ing as Nellie, the daughter, and Oza
Waldrop played Kitty Canary with her
usual brightness and vivacity. Lillian El
liott gave an admirable and convincing
representation of the part of Mrs. Can
ary. The other parts were well sus
tained. Next week Florence Roberts, the
clever star, will commence her engage
ment.
Orpheum.
Murphy and Slater, colored singers and
dancers, seemed to have quite the best
of it in the way of applause at the Or
pheum last night. Their dances in par
ticular are new and clever. The audience
had them nearly worn out before it would
allow them to retire. Lotta Gladstone In
her characterization of the "Quaint Coun
try Girl," also was highly successful in
pleasing her hearers. Her infectious
laughter and amusing Imitations would
make any one forget his troubles. Peter
V. Dailey and his company in "A Dress
Rehearsal" are just as great favorites as
when they first came to town. Something
else that is very funny la "Hogan of the
Hansom," presented by Walter Le Roy

STARS OF THE THEATRICAL
WORLD NOW APPEARING IN
THIS CITY.
"The Toymaker," with its innumerable
funny situations, its ludicrous characters,
its really splendid scenic effects and its
catchy songs, was revived last night at
the Tivoli. The revival was greeted by a
crowded house, which was kept in an al
most continual uproar of laughter during
the entire performance. ; Ferris Hartman
is inimitable in his interpretation of the
character of Johanus Guggenheimer, the
old toy manufacturer, and managed to in
troduce a world of Quaint fun into the
play. He also sings two songs that are
very amusing. One of the. features of the
play that is specially worthy of note be
cause of its picturesque costuming and
the splendid singing which accompanies
it is the scene in the monastery, both in
the first and last acts. The excellent chorus
of male voices', led by Arthur Cunning
ham, in which the monks sing their
songs, are truly delightful to hear. Fran
ces Graham as Frau Guggenheimer re
ceived a hearty round of well-merited ap
plause for her clever singing. Annie
Myers makes a very charming doll and
sustains her part, which is a very difficult
one, in the most commendable manner
Ali the remaining parts are well careci
for, and "The Toymaker" promises *o
have a flattering run. >â¢Â¦Â¦ "'

is exquisite. Their work is in reality quite
out of the ordinary. Stuart Barnes, singer
and monologist, experiences no difficulty
in making the members of the audience
hold their sides in laughter. Irene Frank
lin sings several songs to the evident sat
isfaction of her hearers. The two Little
Pucks do a singing and dancing turn,
which is pleasing to those who enjoy
juvenile performances. For next week,
among other features, the motogirl is an
nounced as something novel and mys
terious.
FRAXCILLOK" is a play that gives
Kathryn Kidder the opportunity
of her life. She is, to use a col
loquial expression, "the whole
show." When she is off the stage
the words uttered by her support seem
commonplace and their actions uninterest
ing. The role of Francine Comtesse de
Reverolles allows her to display the tal-
Itnts she undoubtedly possesses. The rest
cf the company are mere feeders to her
.-Â¦uccess.
; The play is an adaptation of Alexander
Dumas' powerful novel, "Francillon."
Like all French plays, it borders on the
immoral. The lines are unfit to be heard
by young people.
The plot is quickly told. A jealous wife
warns her husband, who has tired of her,
that if he returns to his mistress she will
s-eeure a lover. She carries out her threat
and informs him of it. He thereupon be
comes enraged and cries at the injustice
of it. The delicate subject is discussed
with an abandon that is shocking. Tbe
actors da net mince words and the au
dience waits expectantly for epigrams that
are two-edged in their meaning.
After seeing Miss Kidder play the in
jured wife, who seeks a novel revenge,
the audience might be almost ready to be
lieve, as she declares: "Men are all alike
â liars and cowards"; that "men are liars
and women are fools, an^l fools and liars
make up this world." The play abounds
petite star. Miss Fealy is well supported,
the work of Gardner Crane and Herschell
Mayall in the leading male parts being
particularly good. Little JacK. Robinson
is just as pleasing as any of the grown
people in the cast, and H. D. Byer makes
the best of the few opportunities offered
him to shine. Lillian Albertson and Mar
garet Terry both help to make "My Lady
Dainty" a success. â¢ Â¦ '

The journeymen barbers met last night
and considered reports regarding their
new wage schedule, which is to go into
effect next Monday. The indications are
that the schedule will be accepted by a
majority of the roaster barbers, although
a few of the smaller men will continue to
hold out on the ground that they cannot
afford to meet the raise. During the week
these men will be Interviewed by a com
mittee of the barbers and informed that
the schedule must be accepted.
The boxmakers and sawyers met last
night and considered their new wage
schedule, which is to go into effect im
mediately if it can be accomplished.
President Goff of the Labor Council ad
drttsed the union upon the subject and
advised the men to remain firm In their
tight tor better pay. He assured them of
the support of the Labor Council to th*
last extremity- The election of officer*
resulted in the "following selections: Pres
ident, W. Mindhan; vice president, J a.
Wilson; recording secretary, M. F
O'Brien; financial secretary, F. Slater*
trea&uier, C. Amrhein; trustee, A. King;
delegates to the Labor Councilâ C. Amr
fcein and J. A. Wilson.
Carpi-nters" Union No. 483, which is a
brotherhood organization, met last night,
but no action with reference to the reso
lution adopted by the Builders' Protective
Association Saturday evening was taken.
It was through the mediumship of tht>
association that an armistice was de
clared, and that body is hopeful of ulti
mately securing peace. The District
Council of the brotherhood will meet to
night, when the matter will be formally
taken up. Just what action the brother
hood men will take in the premises re
mains to be seen. The signs for a perma
nent settlement of the controversy, which
involves the right of unions affiliated with
the Building Trades Council to belong to
the Labor Council or any other central
body, are excellent.
The warring factions of the carpenters*
will rest on their oars until July 1, when
the proposition of referring the rescisioa
of clause 3 of the constitution of the
Building Trades Council will be finally
acted upon. In the interim the union men
of the building trades will work with the
brotherhood carpenters, the result being
renewed operations all along the line.
The opinion prevailed at the conference
that any movement in the direction of the
changes in the tariff schedules would dis
turb business conditions and complicate
the coming campaign.
Suggestions as to the tariff revision have
been made to the President by Republi
can opponents to reciprocity with Cuba,
these Congressmen representing that to
change the tariff on one product like
sugar, affecting the beet sugar interests
only, without making changes in other
schedules, would have a disastrous effect
in their States. Some members represent
ing sugar States, and who have seen the
President recently, told him that they
were willing to have a general tariff re
vision, but were opposed to a change on
one article only, as would be the practical
effect of the proposed Cuban reciprocity
legislation:
The members of the campaign commit
tee concurred in the view that no tariff
legislation was necessary and, moreover,
any change would be harmful. They said
they were confident of success on the is
sues as made up and to be made up on
pending legislation.
The Representatives left the conference
some time before the Senators and then
with the latter the President discussed in
detail the outlook for Cuban reciprocity
and especially the stand taken by the con
ference of Senators which met in Senator
Elkins' room to-day. The Senators ex
pressed the opinion that the plan which
the Elkins conference offers as a com
promise will not meet the requirements of
the situation. Continued efforts will be
made to unite the Republicans of the
Senate upon the Spooner plan for a 20
per cent reduction for five years, with
power given the President to annul the
concession if it be found that it goes to
any persons other than the Cuban sugar
growers and planters. It was stated at.
the White House to-night that all the men
who attended the conference at the Cap
itol to-day will not stand out against this
plan, especially if a Republican caucus
indorses it.
All of those present were decidedly op
posed to tariff revision, ei.ther.now or at
ihc short session, the view being ex
pressed that revision was unnecessary,
and that, furthermore, there was no time
for it.
Those present included members of the
Finance Committee of the Senate, thÂ«
"Ways and Means Committee of the House
and of the Republican ' Congressional
campaign committee. The suuject un
der discussion was penciing legislation
and iis relation. to the coming campaign.
M lie chief reason for the assemblage, now
evtr, was the tariff, the discussion turn
ing upon the advisability of attempting
any revision now or of talcing them up in
committee during the recess of Congress
with- a 'view of presenting a measure in
tne short session.
WASHINGTON, June 2.â A conference
was held at the White House to-night

FOOD AND GIRLS.
Study Doesn't Hurt if They Are Fed
Some time ago one of the ladies' papers
published a long list of extracts from
litters from mothers speaking of broken-
down schoolgirls. True, overwork and too
much confinement is largely responsible,
but. on the other hand, if the girl is fed
on the right kind of food to rebuild the
daily waste she can stand more work.
and the matter of food is the real foun-
dation of the subject.
A 17-year-old girl writes from Caro,
Mich., about how a change in food helped
her: "I am only a schoolgirl 17 years old.
but I am old enough to appreciate what
the wonderful brain food Grape-Nuts has
dene for me. About two years ago my
health became very poor and I was. un-
able to study, and finally obliged to leave
echool.
"I was put on Grape-Nuts Breakfast
Food. In about three months I recovered
my strength, my mind became much more
clear and acute and I was able to resume
echool work.
"1 continued to use Grape-Nuts until I
discovered that I was getting too fat. I
gained so much in weight that I had to
discontinue it. It is the best food I ever
heard of for building up a broken-down
system.
"I have an aunt who went to India as a
missionary, and while there she was ill
four times with Indian fever and became
a mere skeleton. When she returned here
her muscles were as flabby as could be.
ghe was put .on Grape-Xuts Breakfast
Food and quickly recovered. Her mus-
cles grew hard and firm and she entirely
regained her health, has greatly increased
In weight and never knows a sick day
now. She is still eating Grape-Nuts, and
eays she would not do without the food
for anything.

your wonderful food." Name given by

1 SALT LAKE. Utah, June 2.â If Presi
dent Brigham Young had lived he would
have been 101 years old to-day. The cele
bration of his birthday was conducted to
day with the usual ceremonies. A salute
of '01 guns was fired from the top of Ar
senal Hill, overlooking the temple, this
morning, while the bronze monument of
the Mormon leader at Main and South
Temple streets was decorated with flags
snd bunting. The annual reunion of the
Young family was held during the after
noon at the Saltair Pavilion, at Great Salt
Lake. Here several hundred descendants
and relatives of President Young listened
to speeches and a musical and literary
programme. Flags and artillery salutes
marked the celebration of the day in oth
! er cities of the State.

Several Hundred Decendants and Rel
atives of Deceased Hold Annual
Family Reunion.
On examination it was found that the
! wound was not serious, the bullet having
I irflicted a merely superficial wound in the
i left side. :
j There Is no clew to the identity of the
man who shot Lewis and the police are
I at a loss to account for the mysterious
! attack, as Lewis is not known to have
i had any enemies. It is believed that there
is a close connection between the tragedy
of last October, in which A. P. Wilcox,
his wife and their three-yÂ«-ar-old son were
i ki'led by an unknown murderer, and last
night's attemnt on the life of the sole
burvivor of the family.
Lewis, who is a special officer employed
at the Burbank Theater, was on his way
borne at 2030 St. Elmo avenue, having left
the East Ninth street car at Santa Fe
avenue at about midnight. He had nearly
reached the house and was passing a
vacant lot when he heard the click of a
revolver and a moment later felt the sting
of a bullet in his left side. Whirling
around, he drew his own revolver and
fired three times in -the direction of the
flash. Lewis called for help and his father
ccrac to his assistance with a shotgun,
but no trace of the would-be assassin
could be found.
LOS ANGELES, June 2.â The mystery
of the wholesale murder of the Wilcox
family near Downey in the latter part
of last October was added to shortly after
last midnight by an attempt on the Ufa
of Bert C. Lewis, a son of Mrs. Wilcox,
one of the victims of the tragedy.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
Mrs. McKinnÂ«Â»y 'said this afternoon:
"No. I was never married to Mr. Smith,
but for thirty years he has been the best
friend I ever had. He has spent nearly
all hi? time that he could spare from his
bi'siness here in my house. See, I wear
his ring and have his other pledges which
will entitle me to most of his estate. His
relatives, who prevented our marriage,
will oppose my. claim, hut if I am not
fully provided for by the will, if there is
one. I shall fight in court for my rights to
the bitter end."
Smith's death was rather sudden and
v.as du? to heart failure. It is believed
he left a will, but the disposition of his
property is unknown. The relatives pro
pese to claim the full estate.
Smith's body was taken to San Fran
cisco la ft night for cremation. Mrs. Mag
gie McKinney went to the private funeral
at the Boggs home yesterday afternoon
and was refused admittance. Through a
friend's intervention she was finally per
mitted to view the remains.
William L. Smith was a native of Vir
ginia, BSfed 1- years. He came here many
years ago and accumulated a fortune. He
became treasurer and quarter-owner in
the McCormiek-Saeltzer t.'ompany, a large
general merchandise corporation of Red
ding. His shares there are valued at $1<*>.-
O'.'O. In addition he was a director of the
Bank of Northern California of this city
and owned real estate and mining inter
ests. Ho spent part of his time with his
niece, Mrs. A. G. Boggs of this city, wife
cf a mining man. fc>he was h!s favorite
relative. Mrs. J. Â«.". Spencer and M. Wi-1
lendorff of San Francisco were his nieoe
and nephew, respectively, and A. J. and
W. A. Bacon of Redding are nephews.
These constitute the heirs.
REDDING, June 2.â Litigation is to tic
up the estate of William 12 Smith, the
Kedding merchant and pioneer, who died
on Saturday night. Mrs. Magrgie McKin
ncy lays claim to the major portion of the
$125,000 left by Smith, and a contest that
will be productive of sensations seem3
certain. Mrs. McKinney asserts that
while she and Smith were never married
their troth had been plighted, and only
by certain circumstances and the bitter
opposition of his relatives were they kept
from a formal marriage ceremony.

vertiser's London 'financial cablegram sayr:
The streets were filled by crowds waving flags,
but enthusiasm wag absent. On the exchange
after the initial singing of tho national an
them the market was fairly active, but there
was no rush. Dealings in Kaffirs was begun
at 9 o'clock, but^as soon as prices were hoisted
there was -free profit-taking by Insiders and
speculators who bought weeks ago. The public
bought moderately, but the buying . did not
balance the realizations. The close was dull,
but there was a good undertone. A general
broadening of the market is anticipated. Con
j eols touched 08 with the dividend. There was
j a bis business, then the price dwindled to
"96 15-1C ex-dividend, equivalent to 97%, with
the dividend or 3-16 up for the day. Invest
ment shares were generally good. American
Ftocks were hardly mentioned. They were
sympathetically strong early, but reacted later
with the rest of the market. Canadian Pacific
was strong on Montreal buying. Peace had
no money market effect, as money is light.
Discount houses raised the deposit rates halt'
to 2 per cent. Copper fortnightly statistics
show a decrease in stocks of 72S tons and in
supplies of 1278 tons.

Dried Fruits in Nczv York.
The New Tork Journal of Commerce says:
"Private ei&U advices from the coast say:
'The ISX'1 crops of fruits arc now nearly a thing
cf the past. Witfc the exception of a few care
of prunes, 12 to 15 carloads of peaches and
eorae raisins the .stock, is entirely exhausted.
The few remaining peaches and prunes of laat 1
year's crop will all be gor.e before new fruits
e.re on the market, and the raisins, which are
here h-Ad principally by the Pacific Coafct
Seeded Raisin Company, will al;;o go out in the |
seeded et&te before new crop raisins are ready
for market. There is still a considerable quan
tity of 1900 crop prunes remaining here, all
of which, excepting the sizes over 100s, are
jointly owned by two firms. These old prunes
Â¦My well be classed as veterans when they en
ter upon theij^ third campaign this fall.
" 'We are now about to enter upon a season
. v hich, :rom present indications, promises an I
Fibundant yield for all varieties of fruits, with
â¢Uie single exception of pears. Weather condi
tions have been most favorable, and the re
sult is if nothing unforeseen occurs between
now and the curing season that we ehall have
one or the heaviest crops ever harvested in the
Stats. The scarcity of labor during the har- j
restlDS season promises to be a serious ques
tion, and the output of cried fruit will doubt- )
1-ss be curtailed to a considerable extent on j
that account. New apricots will be ready lor
delivery in about forty to fifty days, depend- !
ins ui-on weather conditions: new peaches j
early in August; pears late in August; prunes
early in September, and raisins early in Octo
ber.' "
Washington Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section di
rector of the United States Weather Bureau,
for the V.'ashineton Crop Bulletin, week ended j
May 27, is as .follows:
"The striking characteristic cf the week just
past was the spell of four days of heavy, soak- j
ing rain that occurred tfcrouchout the eaet- 1
em and southern counties from the l&th. <o the Â¦
22d. inclusive. From one to two inches of water j
fâ¬ll in that time. The following three dayb I
were pleasant, growing Quite warm on Sunday .
and Monday.
"Previous to the warm days the growth of j
vegetation was very Blew, but the v.arm spell |
has doubtless given all crope a great impetus, t
It is considered conjectural what effect the very 1
heavy rains will have upon the crop of wheat j
and "other train. If run does not set in, as j
tamf are Inclined to fear, wheat will receive |
preat benefit from the plentiful moisture tee
eoll has been stored with.
â¢'The fore part of the week was too wetter
farm work. Planting is practically finished. I
however, and plowing for summer fallow will j
new be continued. Wheat is all stooled out ;
well and covers the ground completely. Fall j
wheat is now IS Inches to 2 feet high, and ,
the earliest is beginning to head. In Columbia |
County, where wheat raising has given place
to barley raising in a measure, the barley looks
very well. Oats are up and growing well In
the Skasit country. Potatoes on the dry lands
Vjok well, but in the bottoms it has been too
i wet and cold for them. Hops have qfcit grown i
Â»Â¦Â»-:! during the past week. It is now quite
y'rtain that plums, prunes and cherries were
t>*aly injured by the cold rains ten days ago.
Grass and clover are luxuriant, making the
meadows very fine. Early strawberries are
Just ripening; the crop is ten days late.'"

Harrison's circular says: "During the weelc
there have been three arrivals of ccal from,
British Columbia. i;j,S30 tons; two from Ore
gon, 5CJ0 tons; one from Washington, 3500 tons: 1
two from Australia, 00C6 tons; total. 23.63<J
tons. The quantity delivered here this week Is
fully equal to any demand 1 that may spring up
In the next few weeks. The complaint troiu:
domestic and foreign importers is very general;
that is, that it is difficult to find buyers at
covering prices. Services of steamers and sail- .
ers for coal carrying are being very freely of
fered by owners at very generous rates, lower
than heretofore known for years, still at thÂ»
reduced rates very few engagements are being
made. Freights from Australia in this direc
tion are exceedingly low, In consequence of
ths comparative failure of the grain cropa
throughout the colonies, and on arrival here
owners will .find very little remuneration for
their property in the present schedule of out
ward grain freights. The coal strike in tho
East only affects this market as far as hard
coals are concerned, of which but very little
Is now being used here. Fuel oil continues to
be the favorite fuel with steam producers.- It is
both effective and economical. The unpleasant
weather so far this spring ha3 helped to ' in
crease the sale of coal for household purposes."

NEW YOK'.C. June 2.â None of the develop
ments sine? the Stock Exchange closed on
Thursdav aft- moon availed to induce any ac
tivity in th< trading. Neither the declaration
of peace in South Africa nor the acute stage
reached in the anthracite strike awakened any
interest in the stock market. There vras some
early demand for frr-iin carrying railroads, ow
ing to the larse advance in ihe clearings re
ported for April over those of last JW-^ The
very light movement of sr.iin. especially ol
ccrn. owing to last year's crop failure, and the
l.romising outlook Jor a full crop this year,
gave added force to this showing. Lnion 1 a
cific Burlington Canadian P-eiiic. among the
Siain-carriers and Reading. Lebigh Valley and
Norfolk and Western, amor.? the Eastern
lines show increases in April clearings of from
S100.000 to nearly $300,000. The languid re
sponse to the peace news waÂ« i:i accord with
the tone of the London market Itself, cut tnero
was undoubtedly realizing on a lame scale on
the part of speculators who have oougnt for
several days past in anticipation of peace.
This speculatiVe profit-taking, however, floes
not alter the importance to the whole financial
world of the ending of the war. the stoppage
cf expenditures unproductive from the econ
omic standpoint. an-I the promise of renewal
of the abundance of money metal from tne
South African pold mines. The reports from
the anthracite region received in \\ all street
were not reassuring. The conviction is gen
eral that the money market must be kept free
from extraordinary strains until the outlook
is dearer fur the meeting of oblations in tne |
fall The heavy borrowings from abroad, j
which must be met. ?.nd the probability of an
active trade demand for money into the inter
ior of the country incite to caution until the
attitude of the foreign borrowers at the period
of renewals becomes evident. In eontrast to
the feeling in New York that demands may be
made upon us by foreign creditors is the feel
ing in London financial circles that New York
may make further heavy demands abroad for
the relief of her money market. The London
Statist points out that "for several years past
*nierica has accepted payment in securities
for its produce and manufactures, but with
money less plentiful In New York it may this
year "elect to take payment in cash. The
Statist sets the possibility that America may
renew the loans obtained on that side in ad
dition to taking gold in payment for exports.
The whole problem, of course, turns largely on
the size of the coming corn crop.
Bonds were dull and irregular. Total sales,

OATSâ The market is In exceptionally strong
shape all over the coast.
The British Government, havlns cleaned up
all the stock in the Domfnion. has been obliged
to draw en the Puget Sound region for supplied
for South Africa, and /it is said that the Puget
Sound holders have pooled and sold practically
their whole ttock. In. addition to this British
demand it is reported that the American Gov
ernment ie in the northern market for 1600
tons. This is expected to be drawn largely
from the San Francisco market, hence it will"
be seen that the situation is one of great
strength. Our local market feels this, and.
large sales have lately been made here at firm
but unchanged prices. The stock on hand in
warehouse and on wharf June 1 was 3451 tons,

continued inactive . .
Receipts of Onions were light, but price*

of carrled-over stock offering. .
String and Wax Beans continued very weak

from Los Angeles selling at $1 per sack.' Choice
offerings of Asparagus meet with a steady de

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The situation in these products remains as
before stated. Receipts of Butter are alto
gether too large, and dealers are still packing
and storing from 50 to 75 per cent. In spite
oi" this there are large stocks on the floors, and
the commission houses are trying to work off
their surplus en each other at concessions. The
feeling is naturally weak under these condi
tions, and the market is decidedly top-heavy.
Cheese continues weak, with large stocks.
Eggs are steady. Receipts are somewhat
lighter, but there are still a good many on the
marketl Fine ranch continue to rule firm.
Quotations show no change.
Receipts were 61,300 pounds, 11 kegs and
450 cubes of Butter, 1010 cases of Eggs. 400

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Owing to the recent rain receipts of Cherries
and Berries were lighter than usual and prices
were higher in consequence. A large portion
of the Cherries showed the effects of the rain,
but the market cleaned up nevertheless.
Early Alexander Peaches, the first of the sea
son, appeared from Vacaville, one box and one
crate being received. The former sold for $1.
but the other was unsold owing to the green
ness of the fruit. Green Apples from the same
place sold at 40@60c per box and Cherry Plums
brought 50c per drawer.

Wheat was helped materially by the strength
in corn. As in the corn pit, conditions in the
wheat pit were very bearish early in the day.
The general sentiment favored selling In spite
of the fact that there had been good declines
for threo days. Yet cables were weak, the
Southwest sold on its good weather and gen
eral reports of favorable weather after heavy
rains, commission houses were sellers and the
crcwd naturally followed suit. September soon
began to pick up on buying by spreaders who
sold July. A fairly steady trade kept prices
up after the early dip, but it was free covering
by shorts later in the day in the corn situa
tion and liberal foretgn clearances that turned
the price up.- July opened %c to %c down at
71%@71%c, rallied to 72'ic and closed firm, a
shade up at f !2%c.
CHICAGO, June 2.â Everything at the start'
worked against better corn prices. Wheat was
weak, the short session at Liverpool resulted in
lower cable?, the country sent in.^623 cars of
corn and promised 520 for to-morrow and the
crowd was bearish. A ,dull market preventeG
much early business r.r.d. July started %c to
'j(,c down, at Clc to <>O ! Jic, and hovered around
the low prices for a lime. Bears,, who had the
market all their own way for three successive
days, plucked up courage and began selling
etill further short, wlien suddenly the big bull
house that is supposed to have control of the
July stuff, started in to the support. Prices
steadied from the decline and soon the short3
began to cover. The support was increased,
offered up, everybody wanted to buy and the
pit became a scene of a semi-panic. July corn
jumped to (i2%c and s-liorts were badly pinch
ed Toward the close there was an easier feel
ing and at the close July was l@l%c at 62%Â®

The regular quarterly meeting of the
Young Men's Hebrew Association was
held last evening at its rooms in the old
Supreme Court building on Larkin street
Among those who took a prominent part
in the deliberations were the Rev Dr
Nieto and the Rev. Dr. I. Myers.
Reports of the various officers and com
mittees showed the association to be In a
strong financial condition and the mem
bership rapidly increasing. So success
ful has been the association that out of
the ten who organized it last November
has grown a membership of 410. of which
240 are males and 170 are ladies of the
auxiliary.
The gymnasium is one of the features
of the association.
Dr. Nieto and Dr. Myers said last night
that the membership had grown to such
proportions that it had become necessary
to look toward obtaining a more com

been formed to find a place that would
meet the requirements.
This evening the association will hold a
boxing tournament in its gymnasium.

Mme. Payer is â¢ determined that she
will find out the identity of the drivÂ»r
of the engine and will make a demand
on Chief Sullivan for a pecuniary settle
ment for the damage done the wagon.
Lcuis Payer, who with his wife conducts
a French laundry at 511 Hyde street, was,
in the course of his duties, out.with his de
livery wagon yesterday. Payer prides him
self on being a most careful driver for, as
he says, "The lives of the citizens are
indeed valuable and my life.' too. is valu
able, therefore I drive with care and I
keep, in my carefulness, my eyes about
me." /
But with all his watchfulness Payer
came to grief yesterday. When turning
from O'Farrell street into Market street
a monster fire engine came in collision
with the wagon of Payer and the spick
and span and highly glazed and starched
lingerie that Mme. Payer had intrusted
to her husband's keeping was badly
soiled. - '* Â¦ ' '
The force of the . collision completely
overturned the laundry wagon, smashing
the top and dislocating the sides, but
Payer, having heard that to jump is a
good thing at the moment of impending
collision, jumped with a dexterity that
surprised even himself. Payer, therefore,
got off his wagon with a scare and noth
ing worse, though Madame said last night
that "Monster would be a long while be
fore he would forget."

To keep Fred from observing when he
emptied the contents of the tomato cans
into his pockets, Henry built a shed over
his location. Fred did likewise. Henry
painted his shed a bright red. Fred
dressed his in a coat of white.
COMMENCED OPERATIONS.
"All right." said Fred. "Go ahead and
hunt. I'll do a little hunting myself, and
if I get it I guess Fred knows how to
spend it." . ' -
They each paid secret visits to the me
dium. Each was given the exact location
of the treasure as revealed In a dream
ordered up from spirit land at the~ ex
pense of an aged mechanic. The locations
were both near a tree, but about twenty
yards apart. Both old men went to work.
Henry explained. Fred: raised the ton
nage of his yacht and 'stood firm. The
friendly discussion became a wrangle, i
"I'll find that gold by myself. I'll keep
it and spend it as I darn please," said
Henry. â.......-. Â»._ .. ,. â
Long and late the old men discussed the
hidden gold. Each had his own ideas as
to how he would spend it. They, ex
changed ideas. They found the ideas in
the aggregate greater than the $60,000.
Then there arose a discussion as to what
part of "the castles I in '-Spain they could
get along without. Fred, was. willing to
cut down the tonnage of his steam yacht,
but he did not see what .Henry, wanted
with two automobiles. â
THE OLD MEN QUARREL.
The directions given by the medium
were somewhat vague. . The treasure, she
paid, was in gold. It -was packed- in to
mato cans' and hidden, hear a tree-on a
slope overlooking Hunters Point. All
they had to do was to, find the tree, dig
until they; came across the -tomato cans
and finish the journey of life' surrounded
by luxury.
Prof essional Â¦ treasure "revealers" don't
work on the contingent -.fee >6y stem.; That
matter, however, was easily arranged, as
both Siemers have been thrifty.
"What you want is treasure. The earth
holds a-plenty, and in. my visions I see
heaps galore of the precious yellow metal
resting where it was -placed, by those
whose spirits disturb my dreams. It can
do them, no good. You need-it. It will be
yours for the digging."
This was the lady's introduction of the
treasure subject made at the close of a
seance attended by the two venerable
mechanics. ; ' _ â¢ .. ;â¢ Â¦
THEY VISIT THE MEDIUM.
Together and\in brotherly amity they
visited the medium. The medium in this
case is a woman who hated to- see. old
nven compelled to toil hard for their daily
bread. . â¢
The Siemers are hard-working mechan
ics. Each has seen more than three-score
summers. They were good -friends until
a week ago. They are both spiritualists,
and to the revelation of hidden treasure
made by a professional medium who "re

Xext Saturday the Democratic State
Central Committee will meet In this city
to select a time and place for holding the
State nominating convention of the party.
Sacramento is making a strong bid for
the convention. It is believed now that
the delegates will be called on to as
semble at the capital city on Monday.
September 1. The Democrats are not
saying much about the gubernatorial can
didates of their own patty. When the
Republicans a few months ago were con
fronted with the danger of Gage's re
nomination the Democrats were exceed
ingly joyful, and a dozen statesmen of
the Jeffersonian stamp came to the front
with aspirations for the first place on
the Democratic State ticket, but now. in
view of the selection of some candidate
other than Gage to lead the Republican
forces, the anxiety to head the Demo
cratic column is not apparent.
The duty of holding in line the push
of San Francisco and vicinty has been as
signed to Johnny Mackenzie.' Walter
Moore, has been appointed to the com
mand of the push forces in Southern Cal
ifornia, with headquarters at Los An
geles. It was at first supposed that W.
F. X. Parker, formerly expert of the
State Board of Examiners, would lead the
gang in the south, but the Gage managers
selected Moore for the work in hand.
Moore is fairly conversant with Los An
geles politics, having served as Chief of
the Fire Department. Corney Pendleton
has political affairs of his own that re
quire attention. Walter Moore is so fixed
that he can give his whole time and all
of his energies to the Gage fight in the
south. . â¢â¢â¢ â¢
DEMOCBATIC COMMITTEE.
Lieutenant Governor Neff seems to have
a, clear Held for the chairmanship of the
convention. The bosses did have a can
didate secretly slated, but the defeat of
the Gage push at San Jose impelled a
change of tactics. It is common talk in
political circles that Gage's name will be
withdrawn from the list of candidates be
fore the delegates assemble in the Agri
cultural Pavilion at Sacramento. Pres
ton, Flint, Schmitz, Pardee and Edson are
not concerned over the transfer of Gage
strength to any particular candidate. The
number of delegates that Gage can abso
lutely control Is not likely to be sufficient
to make or unmake any other' candidate.
The delegates themselves on the floor of
the convention will probably make their
own combinations.
Thomas Flint is the winner of the first
skirmish for delegates to the convention.
"Word comes that the delegates from
Stanislaus and Madera counties have
been instructed fcr - Flint. Next week
Tehama. Glenn and Colusa counties will
select delegates..
A prominent candidate for nomination
for Surveyor General is Victor N. Wood,
Surveyor of San Luis Obispo County. He
is popular and capable and will go to the
convention with the support of many del
egates from the central and southern
regions of California.
NEFF HAS A CI/EAB FIELD.
It is noted that candidates for 'the favor
of the Republican State convention are
not soliciting the support of the GaÂ»;e
pubh. All Indications point to a free and
untrammeled assembly of delegates. Can
didates for position on the ticket will be
judged by their merit. There is likely to
be an animated contest for the nomina
tion for Attorney General. George H.
Bahrs, formerly Superior Judge of this
city, is the latest addition to the list of
candidates for the convention's endorse
ment. Judge Bahrs' well known record as
a vote getter places him in the ranks of
the formidable aspirants.' The German-
American Republicans, who have always
stood by the party, will ask for recogni
tion and urge the nomination of Judge
Bahrs for Attorney General. .
Another misfortune has . overtaken the
Gage forces. The leading.Gage.newspa
per in the State has suspended daily pub
lication and retreated to the >weekly field
of journalism. The Napa Reflector, prior
to April 10, 1902, was a weekly Democratic
newspaper. On All Fools' day; it entered
the field as a Gage 1 Republican dally and
duly announced its change of politics. On
May 19. the day of the San Jose election,
the publication of the Reflector as a daily
was discontinued. There are rumors of
more trouble in the Gage press syndicate,
but the fate of the Reflector may prevent
other Democratic papers from openly
espousing the cause .of the coming ex-
Governor.
The newspapers favorable to Gage's rer
nomination for Governor, are so busily
engaged In defending' bis administration
and explaining: the San Jose election that
they have had no time to claim anything.
The foregoing- statement was taken
down by Stenographer Heynemann, and
will be used at the trial of Officer Lev
ings, which will be held to-night.
I arked him not to charge the prisoner until
the next day. and to call at my house that
evening. He came to my house Monday night.
Before he came I told the whole matter to Mr.
Augenbu>.k. .the boy's former employer. Mr.
Ausrwnfcllck told me not to give Levings any
money, as it was a crime, but to go up to the
house and fin<l out how much the officer want
ed. He said he and another gentleman would
I;e there to witness it. Levings came up that
night and told me he could not "fix thÂ« case"
for less than fl5rt. He also said. "You must
not have those shyster lawyers around, as I
must have the 'dough.' " I asked him why
lie charged Crothers with grand larceny, and he
faid he had to do so as Chief WKtman would
V.eccme suspicious. He also told me he would
3:ave to give the Judge $so, but would not tell
me the name of the Judge.
The first time I saw Officer livings was on a
Sunday afternoon between 3 and 4 o'clock. He
called at my residence and asked for Mrs. Dar
ling. Â¦ He said he was sent by Captain Sey
mour. I imagined he came to Bee me about
The loss of my diamonds, but was mistaken.
Mr. Levings said he came in the interest of
Mr. Me Williams. I told him 1 did not know
llr. JlcWilliams. Livings then said. "I do not
mean McWilliarns, but Crothere." I said,
'Tea. I know Mr. Crothers." He then told
me Mr. Crothers was arrested and was In jail
end scid that he wanted to go to ]iis room and
examine it. Levings had the keys to my house.
He Faitl Captain Seymour had sent him to find
out all he could in the matter. He then search
ed Crothers' room, but found nothing. I made
tn appointment to Â»nect Levings the 'following
<iay at 11' o'clock at the Hall of Justice. . We
both kept the appointment and I paw Crothers
Elone. Crothers told me that Leviiifrs told him
the charge of grand larceny could be changer!
to petty larceny and he would only have to
Berve six months instead of twelve years. As
we were walking down stairs, I asked Officer
livings if this was so and hÂ» told me he '"could
fix the case." lyevings said to me. 'This boy
will get ten or twelve years sure, as I can put
three charges against him. If he pleads guilty
to petty larceny I can get him to the county
.nail by to-morrow at 12 o'clock and he will be-
Kin FTvinjr his sentence." I asked how much
money it would take and be asked me how
much I could raise. I paid, "I don't know;
111 have to telegraph and write to his peo-
I>le. and will let you know to-night." Levings
thÂ«n said. -There will be no time to lose, as
I will have to chai-;re the prisoner or Chiet
"W'ittroan will get suspicious."
Commissioner Hutton conducted the ex
amination. In answer to his questions
she stated she knew Levings. She was'
then asked to state as concisely as pos
sible all she could of the conversation
she had had with the policeman. She
said:
Mrs. Elizabeth S. \ Darling, an Impor
tant witness in the. case of Lerpy L. Lev
ings, the policeman who is charged with
trying to extort a bribe, was officially
questioned yesterday by the Police Com
missioners at the private hospital where
she is confined. Commissioners Newhall,
Howeil, Hinton and Mahoney, accom
panied by Lieutenant Birdsail and Police
OJlicer Levings and Otto Heyntmann, the
official stenographer, went to Hhe hos
pital.
Mrs. Darling is in a precarious condi
tion, and it was with some trepidation
that the Commissioners entered the room.
The lady spoke in a tone just above a
whisper, and the members of the board
and others had to keep close to the bed
tide in order to hear her statement

go to camp will be able to leave there at
5:30 o'clock in tfie mornins and rearti the
city an hour later. A feature of the camp
will be the entertaining of visitors, as the
members of the company will be permit

furnish them meals at a very low rate.

"He told me," said Mrs. Wagner, "that

debt to the extent of $900. He said he
would give- me promissory notes for the
money and would assign over to me thu

with the Woodmen of the World. I gave
bim the money and got the promissory
notes, but have not got his endowment

MASKS CASES DISMISSED.
Edward Swift, arrested on a charge of
being drunk, forfeited five dollars bail
money and in the same manner Conway
appropriated the money to his own use.
Swift, however, called on Conway a day
or two after his case came up and made
a request for the return of his money and
Conway informed him. that it had been
declared forfeited, by Judge Mogan. i
Conway's judgment docket shows that
the case against Swift was dismissed,
while Judge Mogan's record shows that
his bail had been declared forfeited. The
order Conway used to pilfer Swift'3 bail
meney from the treasury was made pay
able to F. Swift or order and indorsed by
him personally with Conway's initials, F.
B. C. C
He failed to appear in court- and his
bail was declared forfeited. Judge Mogan
entered this judgment in his private rec
ord book which he is compelled to keep
under the law, but his clerk, Conway,
marked the case dismissed in the record
he keeps as Deputy County. Clerk. Then
instead of making out an order payable
to County Clerk Mahony, who becomes
the custodian of forfeited bail money,
Conway drew up an order for the return
of the money, making it payable to N
Walker, who is, in all probability, a
myth. Conway handed this order to a
keeper who does quite a business with the
treasury cashing bail orders for his.cus
tomers and it was cashed along with sev
eral other honest orders for the return of
bail money.
BAIL IS FORFEITED.
On May la the case of L. T. Walkman;
ariested on charges of carrying concealed
weapons and disturbing the peace, was
celled in Judge Mogan'a court. The de
fendant had deposited for his appearance
in court the sum of $15.
Judge Mogan states in mitigation of his
careless practices which permitted the
frauds that he trusted hia clerk, Conway
and therefore did not carefully inspect
the orders for the refunding of bail
money.
The investigation into the" records of
Judge Mogan's court developed a nest of
scandal that may lead to more sensa-<
tional disclosures. . In four cases where
prisoners had failed to show up for trial
Judge Mogan declared their bail forfeited,
and right under the very nose of Judge
Mogan Co'nway wrote out orders for the
return of the bail money and handed them
up to Judge Mogan, who affixed his sig
nature to the orders, even though he had
declared the bail forfeited.
The records are silent but potent evi
dences of Conway's guilt, ana probably
before nightfall the Police Court cierk,
who is now out on bail on another charge
of attempting to steal bail money from
the treasury, will be taken Into custody
upon a more serious charge, conviction
on which will mean a long term in the
penitentiary. Â¦ . Â¦
EVIDENCES OF GT7II/T.
Additional corruption and fraud in con
nection with the recently uncovered Po
lice Court bail scandal were brought to
light yesterday when the police secured
from Treasurer McDougald three fraudu
lent orders for ball money, by means of
which Frederick B. Conway, clerk in
Judge Mogan's court, filched $00 from the
city. Just how many more of these fraud
ulent orders there are in existence or just
how much money the corrupt Police Court
officials have stolen is not known, but It
is certain if all the bail frauds that have
been committed during the last year are
brought to light it will be found that
thousands upon thousands of dollars have
been putered by Conway and his associ
ates. - - .

Heart Cure:
1 suffered agonizing pain in the left
breast and between my shoulders from
hc^rt trouble. My heart would palpi-
tate, flutter, tben skip beats, until I
could no longer lie in bed. Night after
night I walked the floor, for to lie down
would have meant sudden death. My
condition seemed almost hopeless when
I be^an taking Dr. MiJes' Heart Core,
: but it helped me from the first. Later
I took Dr. Miles' Nervine with the
Heart Cure and the effect was aston-
ishing. I earnestly implore similar suf-
ferers to five these remedies a trial."
