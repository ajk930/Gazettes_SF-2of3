GAGE'S SNEERING FLING AT
RIVAL CANDIDATES.
There Is a feeling to-night among active
members of the party .who are opposed to;
machine politics that they may be called
upon to-morrow to \ line . up against the
bosses. Apprehension was aroused by tne!
incident that Dibble and Johnson':. were^
placed on the sub-committee and that'
the resolutions may. represent; their Ideas
of Republicanism. : "Fight; or no fight".,
will depend on the report-"-It is the judg-i
ment of many who keep well '. posted in'
politics that a thousand j indorsements ' of
Gage would not offset, the harm he .has
done to his candidacy by his unfortunate
letter to ! the convention.
The plank indorsing .the Republican
State administration, ' it' is . said, â¢â¢will be
so worded as to win the support of ; the
entire committee.^ In,- fact, members of
the sub-committee avow to-night . that no
report will be sent to the convention until
it is unanimously adopted by the full
committee. " â¢ ; : ' , '
It transpires .to-night . that â¢ Senator
Lukens, in the committee on resolutions,
sought to 'get an expression- condemning
constitutional amendment No. 28, but Grove
Johnson and Dibble - declared that they
were in favor of the amendment and that
only the "goody goodies" were opposed
to it., Thus lightly was passed- over a
proposition to enslave the people of Cali
fornia. The delegates to the State League
of Republican Clubs may not '.have the
.courage to-morrow to demand their- rlghj,
to pass . judgment on this j monstrous
scheme. Far-sighted Â¦ politicians would
not be surprised if the failure, of ." this
convention to act would be the signal for
the assembly of a great convention of the
people to agitate the question. ; ,
INDORSEMENT WILL BE MILD.
The result of that campaign points with un
erring finger to our duty in this convention in
view of the Â¦ Impending election. That duty U
to again present rb the people of California a
unified Republican party. There are generous
and honorable - rivalries in all bodies of free
men. There are 'Â¦ contending ambitions and
clashing interests in every form of popular gov
ernment; there are differences of policy and
opinion^ wherever political contests- are '.to be
waged and political prizes attained. These are
proper and healthful to a party where they are
exercised' within legitimate lines, and where
they yield to the ultimate - fiat of parts con
ventions." May we not indulge in the hope
that "this, the largest convocation of represen
tative Republicans ever- assembled in the State
â¢of California, will recognize the practical wis
dom of a unified Republican party, and will
devote its undivided and collective effort, both
here and ' hereafter, to the realization of this
result; and that the leaders, the candidates,
the press, the contending ambitions and clash
ing factions of our party shall be ' compelled
- That' united effort erased the word "doubt
ful," . from . the dictionary of California politics.
and with Its tidal wave of the largest Re
publican Â¦ majority in its history,- swept Cali
fornia far within the boundaries of the safe
Republican- States.
APPEALS FOB HABMONY.
I party should receive such a -welcome. -. Wher
ever culture Â¦ exists, wherever prosperity
;'abound3. wherever .an active, intelligent and
liberal spirit ' of progress prevails, there will
be discovered . a stronghold of the Republican
party; there will be found a people proud and
happy in . the . opportunity afforded them, to
tender their tribute to the grand old party for
its achievements in the past; to manifest to
Its ' assembled manhood their unswerving loy
alty to its principles and leadership in the pres
ent, and - to render assurance of future devo
tion so long as Old ' Glory waves in the breezes
of every zone; so long as humanity finds writ
ten in its increasing stars and seamless folds
the glorious history and undimlnished energy
of the Republican party.
'. But while we thus, rejoice in ' mutual good
feeling It is to be remembered; that this' occa
sion is not to be 'altogether - devoted Â¦ to the
pleasures of . hospitality. This convention has
important labors to perform and serious work
to do. This is a political year. Within a few
months the people of California will be in the
throes of. a general election. The eyes of the
nation will be upon us, watching to see wheth
er the_ glorious record of 1900 shall be rewritten
in 1DC2; 'whether the proud boast that* Cali
fornia was thenceforth to be numbered among
the . safe Republican . States shall be repeated
and. Justified by "the election 'of "the" present
year.' When the convention of . Republican
"League Clubs met in Los Angeles two yeara
ago. it was to make and keep the high resolve
. that so far as its membership could achieve It.
the Republican party of California should pre
sent a harmonious and unified " phalanx '" to Its
"ancient foe. . How amply that resolution^ was
fulfilled you know full well, and every one of
you recaHs with pride how nobly the Repubii
. can League Clubs of California fought shoulder
to shoulder In this splendid, untiring, accord
ant and successful effort. to again exalt to the
Presidential chair their gallant standard bearer
then, but now their sainted and glorified-mar
tyr. | William McKlnley.
. WELCOMED BY PATTON.
"Joseph R. Patton.. chairman .'. of th*e 're
ception committee, delivered " the address
of welcome. He. was warmly received,
and when the applause subslded_lhe. said:
'Â¦Â¦' Gentlemen of the State . League of Republi

Chairman 'Anderson of" the Republican
League, Abe Ruef, the Republican party
of ' Calif ornla and others. The , crowd
yelled/itself hoarse. long before the con
vention, was Called to order, and .when the
address of welcome was delivered the big
gathering was. in a . thoroughly receptive
mood and eager for the performance of
the work it had assembled to perform.
PRAYER > OPENS THE SESSION.
It was* 11:20 o'clock when President Al
deri' Anderson called the convention to
order. Rev. J./VV. Dinsmore of San Jose
offered a brief prayer j in which he asked
that the best purposes of the great gath
ering nflght be subserved. At the conclu
sion of the invocation the president ap
! pointed James A. Kidward, Chief 'Po
lice of San Jose, as sergeat at arms, wfth
power to appoint as -many. assistants as
his judgment might . dictate.
The San Jose Quartet. sang "The Star-
Spangled Banner" .-and the convention
joined -in the chorus with hearty good;
will. As' the band -repeated the. inspiring!
strains of the immortal melody . the dele-j
"gates, most of whom carried small flags,
rose to their feet and waved them fran
tically and joined lustily in the chorus. .- *
Mayor J. C. Martin of San Jose was the
first notable "to be introduced to ;the con-"
vehtion. - He was greeted with great ap-'
plause. Mayor Martin expressed his pleas
ure .at being "able . to be" present at so dls-^

The desire for general harmony is the
theme of the talk. Speakers Indicate that
the party can march to another splendid
triumph if fraternal strife can be allayed.
The convention to-morrow may be
called upon to show its hand on constitu
tional amendment No. 28. the scheme to
surrender everything to a commission
which the Governor will be authorized to',
appoint. Some, fine wortt has: been 3 one
in committee to exclude this subject from
the order of business. There is not much
hope that the committee on resolutions,
of which Grove L. Johnson and* "Judge
Dibble are leading spirits, will be anxious
to bring the glaring danger of the amend
ment to the notice of the convention.
Taken all together, the impromptu ora
tory this afternoon was fairly good. It is
common talk that Judson C. Brusie made
the best speech. A. J. Buckles and Henry
C. DJbble, Grand Army veterans, who are
strong enough combined to* muster a pair
of legs, gave utterance to impressive sen
timents .and won great applause.
HARMONY IS THE THEME.
There was some cheering for the, exec
utH'e when his unfortunate letter was
read, but this mainly signified the delight
of the assembly that the reading of the
dual document was finished.
A feeble effort to create a demonstra
tion in favor of Gage's candidacy for an
other term was made in the convention
this afternoon. Gage rooters and boost
ers from the State office-holding brigade
were scattered throughout the hall to
start the applause when Grove Johnson,
after mentioning Edson, Preston, Pardee,
Flint and Cutter, should wind up with an
allusion- It was amusing to see Jesse
Marks standing up. waving a flag. Alec
Truman and Ben Fehrman were conspic
uous eh&uters. . The great mass of the
convention, however, sat tranquil and se
rene until the boosters had exhausted
themselves with the .shouting. The dele
gates of the Republican Primary t League
were in another part of the city serenad
ing Preston and Edson when the unsuc
cessful attempt to stampede . the conven
tion was sprung. -
At first there was a jsurpicion. that some
one had played a trick on the convention
by sending in a bogus communication,
but inquiry establishes the fact that the
document was handed to President An
derson by a confidential adviser of the
executive. Gage has some friends in the
convention, but the wisest among them
regard his letter as a political blunder.

sion, the Republican Alliance marched
into the theater to the tune of "There'll

through- the streets to the Auditorium
was enlivened by the burning of countless
red, white and blue flre- torches and the
singing of popular songs. There was ; a

Frank Short of Fresno was next Intro
duced.- His subject was "Our Untimely

thoughtful manner. Short opened his ad
dress with the statement that the great"
attribute -of the human race that has
most distinguished it in all times and In
all ages was respect for its ancestors and
hope for its posterity. Without this In
fluence prevailing In a controlling degree
nothing , good could long survive. The
But the most Important work of the Repub
lican League was accomplished: in 1896, wben,
despite the frantic efforts of the fusion of De
mocracy and every schism under the sun; de
spite the false lights kindled along the political
shore; -despite the ravings and howllngs of
demagogy and false prophecy, the Republi
can party swept like a mighty flood over the
North and .West and placed in the Presidential
chair one of the purest men, one of the sound
est statesmen, one of the most exalted patriots
that ever gave his labor and his life to lift up
and dignify his country.
In every campaign since 1888 club organiza
tion and intelligent educational club work have
been potent, agencies contributing to the suc
cess of the Republican party, and . the power
and glory of the American nation at home and
abroad. v.r -;â¢;, r '* Â¦-^'Â¦â¢y.i Â¦Â¦>:â¢ Â¦"--Â¦Â¦*'Â¦- ".-. v -- -,
In 1892 the Democrats were better educators
thari we. They taught the doctrine of cheap
ness and opposition to American enterprise
very effectually, but their very,, success and
their election of Cleveland, a Democratic House
of Representatives and a Democratic Senate
was. after all, the - best education on the issue
of protection versus low tariff the American
people ever had. As soon as the false doctrines
of Democracy on the issue were exploded by
actual experience, the reaction in favor of Re
publican principles set In, and aided by the
educational work of the Republican League, in
1894, the flow tide of right thinking on this
great issue carried into the House of . Repre
sentatives and the Senate of the United States
an overwhelming Republican- majority.
In order to insure success to the Republican
party in that momentous campaign the Ameri
can people had to be educated to a thorough
understanding of the issues involved. -Then be

retding or de-ate.
Sylvester Shabin of San Francisco pro
tested against this course. He said there
were many delegates . present who de
sired to have resolutions read, and . he
hoped they would not be shut off in a
summary manner. He asked the conven
tion to defeat the amendment. â¢'Â¦ Â¦
A viva voce vote being taken, the chair
declared the amendment carried. Shouts
of division were raised, and when the:
standing vote was taken" the" affirmative
was overwhelmingly in the majority.
In quick succession motions prevailed
for the appointment of a committee of
tvrenty-five on order of business, one. of
three to select a place for holding "the
next convention, and another of eight,
one from each Congressional District, to
draft resolutions of respect to the mem
ory of the late President McKinley.
The chairman asked for_Â±ime in which
to make his selections, and this being
granted it was decided to pass the interim
in listening to brief addresses.
A member of the Army and Navy League
called for Colonel George A. Stone of
San Francisco, who responded briefly.
He referred to the aims and purposes of
the league, and said it was the duty of
Republicans to do all in their power for
the uplifting and maintenance of the
principles of the party.
Henry C. Dibble next addressed the con
vention. He said the gathering was an
expression by the Republicans of Cali
fornia of their approval of the national
administration. His ambition was to
fix upon the minds of his hearers the
great truth that the destinies of the na
tion were in the hands of the Republicans
of the nation.
Dibble spoke at length upon the admin
istrations of McKinley and Roosevelt,
every allusion to the latter being the sig
nal for cneers. In conclusion, he said:
The Republican party was the instrument of
God in bringing about the great achievements
of the past few years. It is the duty of the
people to assist In the perpetuation of the prin
ciples upon which the party is founded. â¢

Carey Van Fleet of tne University Club
was introduced as a representative of the
younger branch of the Repuoiican party
of California. He expressed satisfaction
at being allowed to gather with the old
guard, dwelt eloquently upon the pur
poses of the party ana voiced the predic
tion that they would survive the eros
ions of time and the bitterness of oppos
ing partisanship. He quoted the famous
expression of Louis XV, "After us, the
deluge." After the victories of the Re
publican party whclh the future assured,
he said, the deluge may come; but its
coming would long be -delayed, -and, the
speaker said, the Republican party would
see to it th&t Its effects would not seri
ously be felt.
William A. Knlghten. of Los Angeles
was ' introduced as the Vpreacher-politi
cian." He said he did not know who
dubbed him a preacher politician, but he
consoled himself with the reflection that
he was an American citizen. He praised
California as being the greatest Stateâ

might be so considered. He spoke of the

Raise Money for a New
Building.
One of the most representative gather-
Ings of the young men of the Methodist
denomination ever called together in this
city was held last night in. Simpson Me
morial Church.. The purpose of the meet-
Ing was to devise ways and means by
which the Methodist church might be ex
tended in this city. At the suggestion oC
Bishop Hamilton it was determined, amid
considerable . enthusiasm, that the | young
men should form themselves into a so
ciety, to be known as the Men's Metho
dist League. Through this league, Bishop
Hamilton stated, he hoped to induce
the young Methodist men to take more
interest in the advancement of their re
ligion, and also to produce a more broth
erly spirit among the men themselves.
The objects of the league were set forth
in detail in a set of resolutions read by
the Rev. A. C. Bane., In these resolutions
It was declared that the church should
enter upon a . new period of growth and
that money should be raised with .which
to purchase suitable church sites in parts
of the city best adapted to the introduc
tion of the. Methodist doctrines. - It was
decided to raise this money by increasing
the assessment of the various churches,
and the decision .as to the amount that
each church .. should '. be asked : to con
tribute was left in the hands of the City
Church Extension Society. The, new
league will not, however, be devoted
Â¦wholly to the construction of new houses
of worship, but it will also have a socia.

ises of the future were of the brightest

Senator Charles 'M. Shortridge next took
the floor and said it was time to "play

"fellow statesmen," and was glad to ex
tend to the visitors a hearty welcome to
San Jose.
At the close of the Senator's address
there were yells for Ruef. He was re
ceived with cheers on taking the platform.
He said, in part:
! We did not come here to talk, but to listen
We came here because we are Republicans and
because -we believe in the principles of our
great party. This gathering shows that we are
united, and the interest that Is displayed

ORATORS HOLD
FORTH AT EVE
When the display of . enthusiasm died
away Judson Brusie delivered a brief.ad
dress, in which he referred to the con
vention as a "love feast" Republican
ism, he said, meant the salvation of the
country and the ennobling of the people.
He had a few good things to say, but he
did not desire to waste them on the pres
ent gathering. .
"I'll wait until I get a bunch of Demo
crats before me," he f concluded, â¢ amid
laughter. "To Republicans as true as you
are, I have little to say. Your minds may
be made up, but when you leave here go
away with the resolve to work- and win
and you will be successful.": :
A number of letters and telegrams .were
read by the secretary. These included
encouraging sentiments from Senator Per
kins, the California Representatives in
Congress and Governor Gage. The latter
expressed his . regret at being unable to
attend the convention, and his allusion
therein to his own candidacy for renomi
nation was made the pretext for another
abortive attempt at enthusiasm. Scarcely
had the sound died away when some one
started the inevitable refrain.
Hale, Hale, the nominee.
What the Hale do we care? . '
We'll Hafle the nominee. ' . â¢
Johnson alluded to the "gauge of battle"
and the Gage partisans in the convention
sought to stampede the body by a display
of enthusiasm which was painfully forced.
The southern delegates yelled lustily, but
the main body remained quiet, with eyes
lifted to the ceiling. When the attempt
to press the Governor upon the convention
failed, several of the Alliance men began
to sing a lively refrain in the interest of
O. A. Hale. This was repeated several
times during the oratory of the afternoon.
Judge Buckles of Solano addressed the
convention. He spoke of the intrepidity
of the Union cause, which broke the back
bona of the rebellion, and said that the
cheering heard in the convention was an
indication that the Republican I party
would break the backbone of Democracy,
the coming, fall. Unlike the -previous
speaker. Buckles did care a great deal as
to the personnel of the candidates to be
chosen. He was desirous that the very
best men of the party should be selected.
If the present purity of the party were
maintained, he said, there was no doubt
of the result at the coming election. .-Â¦.-, .<
When I saw these Â¦ factions gathering .to-day
I realized that the party was unified, and that
victory was ours In November. Speaking, for
myself; I don't care who the nominees of the
party may be, because I know that they are
sure to be elected. (Cheers.) I feel that this
meeting presages a united party and that We
are sure -to win. We will again Inscribe the
word victory upon our party . banner, and the
news will reverberate throughout . the Union
that California stands for Republicanism and
progress.
early history of California and said it
was the Repbulican party that saved the
State for the Union. The doctrine of Re
publicanism stood for the uplifting of
mankind, the integrity of the people and
the welfare of the nation. So long' as
the Republican party was in power, so
long were the destinies of the Union safe.
Grove L. Johnson of 'Sacramento was
next introduced. He was warmly re
ceived, and spoke in part as follows:
President Anderson Appeals for Unity in Responding to the Welcome
on Behalf of the^i^
by our insistence and induced by our example
to subordinate every discordant purpose to the

Entertaining these thoughts and these senti
ments, I again tender to this assemblage of
delegates and representative Republicans th^
hospitality and greeting of good cheer on behalf
of Santa Clara County and San Jose, its Gar
den City.
RESPONSE OF ANDERSON.
When Patton had concluded his address
three cheers were given for San Jose.
President Anderson delivered the re
sponse in behalf of the league. He said:
On behalf of the officers and delegates of the
State League of Republican Clubs 1 thank you
for the cordial welcome which you extend On
behalf of the Mayor and the people of San
Jose. The reputation for hospitality of the
people of the 'Garden City," 1 have no doubt,
has much to do with the splendid attendance
at this convention.
I listened with attention to your remarks in
regard to Ban Jose and its environments, and.
while approving them in detail, 1 believe the
delegates wili exclaim, as did the Queen of
t?hÂ«-ba of old, "The half has not been told."
I indorse all that you have said of the league
and its objects, and in this connection it is not
out of place at this time for me to say a few
words In regard to the league and the character
of thÂ« gathering here assembled.
The National League of Republican Clubs of
the United States was organized in New York
City in 18S7. with Senator William M. Evarts
as president.
The national league was first represented in
this State in the campaign of 18S8 by the Re
publican State Club of San Francisco, with
headquarters in San Francisco, with that stal
wart leader. General \V. H. L.. Barnes, as
president. (Cheers.) In the campaign of 1892
the State club did effective work, with Hon. W.
H. Chamberlin as president. Since that time
the work of the league, with the names of the
officers, is more generally familiar to those
now interested in club work and political mat
ters.
The League of Republican Clubs was organ
ized to work for the success of the Republican
party at the polls. Its constitution forbids,
end rightly so, the indorsing of any candidate
lor office prior to their r.ominataion in a reg
ular way by the representatives of their party.
(Cheers.)
It concerns principles rather than people, and
one of its highest aims is to obliterate faction
alism from within our party ranks. This is as
it ehould be and just as long as. the league is
run upon that principle will ft prosper and be
a valuable adjunct to the general success of
the whole party. - â¢â¢"-:â¢Â¦-,
STRENGTH IN ORGANIZATION.
These delegates assembled here, by their
presence and by their characters, tell to you
and to the people of San Joee, in stronger
terms than I can express by words, the fact
that they are intelligent, thoughtful, repre
sentative men who value highly the blessings
and the opportunities of our country and our
lorm of government. (Cheers.)
They stand more essentially than any other
political organization for disinterested citizen
ship as distinguished from the active politician,
and their best wishes and most earnest desires
are all for good laws and for good government
honestly and ably administered.
They are Republicans because they believe
that this country can best and most truly
thrive and prosper in the future, as it has
progressed in the past, under the principles
and through the policies of the Republican
party; and that those policies and principles
should be administered and executed by Re
publican representatives. (Applause.) .
The ability of Republican clubs to do good
work for the Republican party is powerful
through its potent agencies of organization and
education. Organization is always the prime
factor of continued success in any line of en
deavor, and the organization into clubs of those
professing Republican doctrines will always be
a tower of strength to the party. (Applause.)
In the impending future there will be much
work for it to do, for new issues and new
problems confront us which will need the
thoughtful and earnest consideration of our na
tion's best and most enlightened men.
Thus you can Bee that we come to you with
good intentions as citizens. We come with
high ideals as partisans, and withal we come
upon a peaceful and laudable mission and we
leel, or know rather, that we are among
friends.
Again. I thank you on behalf of the league
for your cordial welcome, and in conclusion
only beg leave to express the hope that our
coming will not be without some Email portion
of reciprocated pleasure to the people of San
Joee. (Cheers.) ,\
ROLLCALL OF DELEGATES.
Secretary Albert Lindley read the offi
cial call for the convention and the busi
ness session was thus formally opened.
The roll call of delegations was proceeded
with, the chairman of each county and
district delegation answering to the call.
This consumed considerable time, but its
passing was without interest. Many of
the delegations answered in mighty cho
ruses. The number of clubs was 158, witt
a membership of 3162 delegates and a to
tal League membership of 66,975. A recesfc
was then taken for five minutes to enable
the president to select a committee on
credentials, and after the expiration of
that period the following committee was

But the party will not fall to arise to the
full measure of its opportunities. It will falter
here and there on its onward course; its confi
dence will be betrayed sometimes by selfish
men; in Its efforts to promote our own wet
fare It may seem to lack sympathy with the
struggling sons of liberty In other lands; but
it will recant Its errors in time and continue
to build securely upon the old foundations that
have challenged the admiration of the best
men of the age. The party will continue to
recognize its obligations, by wise legislation
and through the Instrumentality of honest and
competent officials, to advance more and more
the highest Interests not only of our own peo
ple but Of the whole civilized world. May the
young men "Just fresh frorn the Creator's
hands and with the unspent energies of . the
coming eternity, wrapped in their bosom" con
template the mighty gifts with which they have
been endowed and resolve that they will de
vote themselves as far as possible to the wel
fare of the State and of the nation, and may
they remember, as Robert C. Winthrop said,
"that self-government politically can only bÂ«
successful if It be accompanied by self-govern
ment personally; that there must be govern
ment somewhere, and that if the people are
Indeed to be sovereigns they must exercise
their sovereignty over themselves individually
as well as over themselves in the aggregate,
regulating their own lives, resisting their own
temptations, subduing their own passions and
voluntarily imposing .upon themselves soma
measure of that restraint and discipline which.
under other systems is supplied from the ar
mories of arbitrary power; the discipline of
virtue in the place of the discipline of slavery."
At the close of the address Chairman
Anderson announced that Samuel M.
Shortridge, who was to have addressed
the meeting:, had been unexpectedly called
from the theater, but that he would de
liver a speech at the opening of the con
vention to-morrow morning. The meet-
Ing then adjourned until 10 o'clock; to
morrow morning.
The time Is coming when conventions will be
controlled, platforms will be formulated, tho
offices will be filled and the functions Â¦ of gov
ernment win be executed by men seeking not
their own. but the glory of the republic. To
the practiced politician who- is In politics for
the loaves and fishes this may seem a Utopian
dream, but the world Is- movtns on v> fc>sh*r
and better things.
Disclaiming any desire to provoke lnviduous
compaiisons. I may say that the last half
century of the world's . progress has failed to
produce, more noble examples of sterling Inde
pendence, of dauntless courage, of lofty pa
triotism, and Intelligent and constant devotion
to the well-being of society than those fur
nished by the virile, and ambitious young men
who have made our party what it isâ the ad
miration of the world and a potent agency of
civilization and the stronghold of justice and
law. Ths young men of our party have not
quatled In the presence of danger; they have
accepted reverses with complacency; they have
shown moderation In the hour of success. In
every emergency they have obeyed the call of
duty and have stamped upon the enduring;
monuments of the age their own heroic, in
trepid and patriotic characters.
Albert G. Burnett of Santa Rosa fol
lowed with a stirring: speech on the sub
ject "Young Men in Politics." He called
attention to the necessity' of young men
engaging in politics as a sacred duty. ! It
was because of the apathy of the young
men that corruption too often prevailed
in .the city, State and national politics.
Referring to Republican young men the
speaker resumed:
This understood and considered, we are no*
upen trial for the Republican party; not for this
nation or the union of States; not for a genera
tion or even a race; but we are upon trial for
human liberty, equality, self-government for
mankind and for all time. Let us hope that It
shall be God's will and way that those wa
mourn to-day as our untimely dead, with others
whose worth and. service have adorned the his
tory of our party to such a degree that they
have passed beyond and above us and belonz
to our country and to mankind, shall from ths
battlements above long continue to look down
upon the nation and the people that they served
and loved so well, and may they ever see their
countrymen free, equal and untrammeled. and
this nation moving on its destined and de
signed course â that, seeing, they may know
that they lived not, labored not, neither died,
in vain.
Never again In this history of the world can
there be spread out before any people such an
imperial dominion as has been subjugated by
our race. No. other racÂ« can ever excel in
worth or virtue those ancestors of ourÂ». wno

There are numerous Indications o\ a. revival
of popular confidence in Democratic policies.
State and national. A change of measure* and
of men seems to be Imperatively demanded by
the best Interests of our state and country. .",
Our opponents have only succeeded in re
cent years by unfortunate divisions among our
selves. Let our faces now be toward the com
mon enemy.
It is a time for unity, for organization, for
wise counsels and for aggressive action.
Hill's speech was interrupted by fre
quent bursts of applause. At its conclu
sion Congressman James M. Griges of

KEAV YORK. April 14.â The members of
Â¦the Democratic Club to-night commemo
rated the birthday of Thomas Jefferson
with a reception at the clubhouse. It was
locked upon among the Democrats of the
city and State as a harmony meeting.
David B. Hill, who had not visited the
club for a number of years, was the chief
orator of the evening aSS in his speech
he called upon Democrats to unite In har
mony. Perry Belmcnt, whose differences
with Bryan end Croker have kept him
away from the dub for three years, was
also there.
Lewis Nixon, the new leader of Tam
many Hall, introduced Hill, who said in
part: *
It ie not for the true interest of any com
munity that & few men should be employers
and that the treat body should be employes
or servants. In a. free republic like ours an
equality of fortunes among our citizens is be
lieved to be desirable, and industrial liberty
te.ids toward that result and hence is ecsen
tial.
It is perhaps difficult to predict how Jeffer
son if tie were alive to-day would meet the
difficulties which we encounter. We venture
to suggest that he would insist upon some
reasonable limitation upon the amount of cor
porate capital which might be Invested In a
Oingle corj>oration.
Jefferson's teachings might suggest a limi
tation upon the amount of dividends which
could be lawfully declared or upon the profits
which could b* legally accumulated by these
tremendous business organizations. Â¦ Or he
might demand that the Government in Justice
to it* overburdened taxpayers should withdraw
Us tariff favors from the "infant Industries"
represented by these institutions whose pro
jectors are already rolling in wealth and are
â¢lEtorishlng the world by the v munificence of
their private benefactions.
We may well believe that Jefferson, who was
equal to every emergency In the early history
of our country, would, if he were in power,
find come appropriate and adequate remedy to
curb tiie rapacity and restrict the dangerous
power of these gigantic combinations.
On Colonial Extension.
On the subject of colonial extension
Hill said: . j 0
It iÂ» safe to believe that Jeffeson would
never have favored an expansion of our Juris
diction which did not carry with it the pro
vlEions of our constitution, to which he was
so devotedly attached and which he defended
so vigorously with his voice and pen. He
would unquestionably have viewed with abhor
rence the establishment of a permanent Ameri
can colonial system, whether continued under
military rule or under civil authority ap
pointed by the central eovernment at Wash
ington. His theory was unquestionably the
I>emocratlc doctrine of to-Â«iay â that .tills Gov
ernment hts no more authority to create a per
manent colonial system than it has the right
to create a Kins.
Jefferson, as the friend of popular rights,
favored a provision In the Federal constitution
for the election of United States Senators by
the people of the respective States, but tem
porarily yielded his views rather than imperil
the adoption of that Instrument.
Why rtiould we divide over the questionable
utterances of modem party Dlatft>rms, largely
designed to meet temporary emergencies which
Â«oon paÂ£R away, when we are all united upon
the rockbottom and fundamental doctrine of
our faith â 1::tznde6 to last as long as our
Government itself shall endure?
Why should there be factional quarrels over
details when we are all united upon essentials?
It is the part of wisdom for the Democracy
to push to the front the irsues upon which
there is substantial unanimity and ignore
those in regard to which there are such serious
anfi lionest difference* of opinion aa must be
fatal to r>racticaJ euccess.
The administration of President Roosevelt
if all at sea. It has no fixed policies or fixed
conventions. It "wobbles" upon every public
question which It assumes to deal. The meÂ»>-
Fages and public addresses of the President
are merely elaborate treatises upon elementary
questions of groveniment. containing nothing:
new and deflnitP. He has no policy In oppo
sition to that of Congress and is prepared to
approve whatever ConareES does.
Distrusts the Republicans.
We have learned to distrust the utterances
of Republican Presidents upon tariff questions,
because they are evidently not their own mas
ters. Â»but are larcely controlled by the great
tariff interests which usually dictate the Re
publican tariff legislation of this country.
If any relief whatever to Cuba shall be se
cured from the present administration it will
be due to the decided stand taken by " the
Democrats in Congress insisting that justice
should be done.
The policy of the administration in the Phll
irpine Islands iÂ» a disgrace to civilization.
The attempt with regard to these possessions to
imitate the foreign policy of - England has
proved a dismal failure.
The administration will send its rpecial np
ref=entatl\'e* to witness the coronation of a
KiriK. but It has no words of sympathy to ex

who are heroically Etrurgllng to maintain their
republics.

W. F. Taylor of 1601% Geary street and
Frank J. Silvey of 913 Hyde street called
at the Morgue last night and informed
the -Goroner. that -Louise Vetter, aged' 5
years, who died on Sunday, night at her
father's residence, 1544 Page street, had
been poisoned. The death certificate,
signed by Dr. Wilson, shows the child
succumbed to catarrh of the stomach, a
disease from which she suffered from in
fancy. Mr. Vetter said last night that
Taylor and Silvey, relatives of his dead
wife, were prompted to make the accus
ing statements by jealousy, as ill feeling
has existed between tlrem. for many years.
No attention was paid: to the charges by
the Morgue officials, as the statement of

be without foundation. ,
Make Charges of Foul Play.
According to the San Jose report. Gage
has lost hope of getting the renomination
from his .party and is now bending his
efforts toward securing the toga that will
be cast'off by Senator Perkins: that the
Governor and his astute advisers have
concluded that the better course would be
to keep up the pretense of . making a
strong fight for the nomination and then
gracefully retire at the eleventh hour in
favor of Flint.
There seems ; to be some foundation for
the rumor, despite the fact that Senator
Flint pooh-poohs it. There is no mistaking
the fact that Governor Gage is at the Pal
ace, and there Is no mistaking the further
fact that Senator Flint journeyed all the
way to the Palace to hold converse with
the chief executive of the State.
THERE Is a well-defined rumor
here and in San Jose that Gov
ernor Gage has giveir* up all
hope of obtaining a renomina
tion at the hands of his party,
and is now setting [his cap for
Senatorial honors. Rumor fur
ther has it that Gage will retire In favor
of Senator Thomas Flint of San Juan.

Â¦ Senator Flint was questioned about this
report last evening and dismissed the ..en
tire affair by saying there was nothing
in the rumor. Â¦ Governor Gage would see
no representative of the press last even

SAN JOSE, April 14.â Former Governor
H. H. Markham makes positive denial
that any arrangement exists between
Flint and Gage in (reference to the candi
dacy of either for the Governorship or for
United States Senator. The rumor, that
has circulated freely here is that one or
the other would withdraw from the race
for Governor, and, in return, would be
supported for the Senatorship. Markham
says if any one withdraws it will not be
( "Flint went to San Francisco to-day to
attend a convention of the Masons -and I
expect him back in the morning," said he.
"This talk about withdrawing, from the
gubernatorial fight is all bosh. The mat
ter was broached to me to-day, and, al
though I have had many conferences with
-Flint, I know that he intends to stay in
the fight to the finish. Â¦ I think the story
was first circulated in Los Angeles by the
friends of Gage with a view of injuring
Flint's candidacy. I can only give my per
sonal assurance that the story is without,
foundation." ; . .'
Rumor That Gage Will Withdraw in Favor
of Flint Is Current in Political Circles.

Colonel Preston made a speech, which
was bright and felicitous. He was
cheered to the echo when fie said that he
would "stand by the party, no matter
who may be chosen." He was Introduced
by A. Ruef, who said that the small but
earnest band of workers of the Republi

At 2 o'clock the Primary League dele
gates formed in front of the Courthouse
and made a tour of the stopping places
of those who have political ambitions.
Each one was treated to a selection by
the band, felicitous speeches and hand
shakings were indulged in and a period
of good-fellowship followed.
The first place visited was the Hotel
Vendome. Abe Ruef, who led the pro
cession, announced that the Republican
Primary League was going to find the
"next five Governors of California," but
he succeeded in rounding up only two of
the prospective candidates. These were
Colonel E. F. Preston and Railroad Com
missioner E. B. Edson.

Woodward of the Republican Primary
League, tW march to the St. James Ho
tel was begun. The Republican Mutual
Alliance was headed by Sylvester Sha
ben Â£s marshal, resplendent in a gold
sash. He v.as followed by Martin Kelly,
the organizer of the Alliance, and sixty
five delegates. " ,
A committee of citizens of San Jose,
consisting of E. A. and J. O. Hayes, J.
R. Johns and Mitchell Phillips, was on
hand to welcome the guests and see that
none of them went astray. It performed
its duty well. As soon as the hotel was
leached the delegates proceeded to the
convention hall, again" headed by their
band, and caused considerable stir as
they entered.
SAN JOSE, April 14.-A special
train containing the delegates
of the Republican Primary
Eeague, the Republican Mu

American Club and a num
ber of other organizations
pullefl out of the Third and Townsend
street depot at 8:30 o'clock this morning.
The train was chartered by the Republi
can Primary League, and flaming posters,
on each side of a number of Uhe cars,
advertised the Republican Primary
League through the villages and towns
of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
A brass band accompanied the excursion
and rendered selections on the way.
About 500 passengers were on the train,
and all talk was directed toward politi
cal subjects.
Efforts were made to find Thomas B.
Flint of Ventura at tho Hotel St. James,

welcome, the ladies on the hotel piazza
from which he spoke waving their hand
kerchiefs at the "young Napoleon" of
Republicanism, as one df them happily
styled him.
I am pleased to meet you centlemen of the

f ay AUSALITO, April 14.-J5espite
jT the strenuous exertions on the
part of the hill tribes of Sau
"""'W salito, the poolroom contingent
AL jf scored a sweeping victory in
L to-day's election. Both of the
candidatesâ Jacques Thomas
and Edwin H. Shoemakerâ who were sup
ported by the poolroom men for the office
of City Trustee were elected. Because of
the intense rivalry between the two fac
tions "It was feared that trouble would
break out during the day. Sheriff Taylor
was on hand with a competent force to
care for any one who might attempt to
interfere with the voting, but his services
were not required in a single instance. It
was whispered about that the poolroom
men would import "thugs" to terrify the
timid hill residents, but the rumors proved
It became apparent early in the day that
the poolroom men would triumph. The
heavier portion of the votes was cast ear
ly in the morning. The anti-poolroom
faction claims that its opponents won by
"colonizing" the tpwn. This faction had
representatives at the polls and every
voter who did not bear the appearance of a
bona fide resident was challenged. About
fifty votes were held up in tnis manner,
but the election judges allowed forty to
swear in their votes. # â¢ /
W. G. Morrow, who was one of the
candidates of the Municipal Improvement
Club, made a very energetic fight during
the morning, but as the contest advanced
and his chance of election waned he de
serted his place at the polls and gave up
â¢the fight in despair. . Thomas Frost, one
of the leaders of the poolroom men, had
lieutenants stationed at the- polls taking
down the" names of all the voters. By
this means he was enabled to know just
how the battle was progressing.
One of the significant results of tfte
election was the defeat of Adolph Sylva.
who for years has held the position of
political dictator of Sausalito.
The result of the - election was about
3 to 1 in favor of the poolroom candidates.
Four hundred and ninety votes were cast.
Forty-one ballots . were thrown out \ on
final count, owing to technical errors. Out
of the 441 votes counted Jacques Thomas
received 28ff"and E. H. Shoemaker 288. The
totals of the other candidates were as

Ed Findley was re-elected Clerk and

in this city to-day was a spirited one. It

Colombian Soldiers Win
Two Battles From
Uribe-Uribe.
LONDON, April 14.â Not for many years
has Great Britain's fiscal programme
been awaited with such interest as that
which attached to this year's announce
ment and there is no doubt that all the
proposals contained in the â¢ budget given
out to-day by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
the Chancellor of the Exc&equer, will be
adopted. It is equally certain, however,
that none of the proposals will meet with
the unanimous approval of either side of
the House.
More important perhaps than the curi
ous forms of the new taxation is the
statement made by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer that the Government had ac
ceded to the Boer demand concerning the
restocking of farms. At a late hour to
night it was stated upon excellent au
thority that the principal provision of the
budget, namely, the treasury loan of Â£32,
oou.iwu, upon which Sir Michael HicKS-
Beach was remarkably reticent, has a
serious bearing upon the peace â¢ question.
There appears to be a very strong be
lief in the Cabinet that, owing to the ex
pected early termination of me war the
Â£32,000,000 will never be needed. When
that section of the budget gets to the
committee state the peace negotiations
will probably have reached such a shape
that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach will be able
to announce a diminution of to-day's esti
mate. In any cage this loan will prob
ably be called up In small installments
only.
The fear to explain the important point
is taken in the riouse of Commons to in
dicate that the Government has strong
hopes of a speedy issue of the iiegotia
tions now pending at Pretoria between the
Boer leaders, annough it wishes to im
press the world in general and the Boers
fin particular with us ability and determ
ination to push the war to a finish should
the British terms of peace be refused.
Faces a Big Deficit.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach rose in the
House of Commons this afternoon and
made the budget statement. He declared
the past year had not been exceptionally
prosperous, but there was nothing to de
press the country. Despite the fact that
thousands of workmen had been removed
from productive labor by the war, the
revenue figures showed -no diminution of
business at home, while there, was a sat
isfactory increase of foreign trade, and
there was no reason . for thinking that
there had been any falling off in the con
suming power of the people. The Chan
cellor estimated the expenditure for the
coming year at Â£174,609,000. The revenue

by Lord Kitchener* who reports that
about 200 Boers were killed, wounded or
captured. There were about a hundred

the Boers killed. â¢ .

Government Accedes to De
mand to Restock the
WASHINGTON, April 14.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day heard argu
ments in the case of the State of Wash
ington vs. the Northern Securities Com
pany and the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern railroads, involving the merger
of the two railroads. Attorney General
Stratton appeared for the State and made
the opening argument, contending that
this court is the only one that can prop
erly hear the case and that If It refuses
to hear It there is no tribunal to which
the State can apply for the redress of a
wrong. He was frequently interrogated
by members of the court.
Justice White asked why the State could
not pass a law of its own to cover the
case, and Stratton replied that he thought
the State had that right, but that It also
is entitled to an independent proceeding
for injunction. In reply to Justice Har
lan he said that the j State might, of
course, proceed against either of the rail
road companies for damages, but chat the
Northern Securities Company could not
be thus reached in a State court.
The Chief Justice wanted to know if
the State could not institute a suit and
give the Securities Company a chance to
come in.
"Yes," was the reply, "but it won't
come in, as has been made manifest in
Minnesota." â¢
Stratton agreed with a suggestion made
by Justice Brewer that the railroads in
volved are interstate roads and that on
this account it was competent to appeal
to the national authorities. .
"What do you think of State owner
ship? Could not the State take possession
of the roads and run them?" asked the
Chief Justice.
Stratton replied that such a remedy had
not occurred to him. "What the State of
Washington wanted was that the court
should enjoin a combination of the two
roads in a third corporation under the
guise of .an Individual, and he believed
that this would not be permitted. He
closed with the charge that the combina
tion is a violation of the contract obliga
tion of the railroads implied In their ac
ceptance of. charters from the State.

HEAVY STORM
VISITS BERLIN
The several conferences of last Satur
day, including that between. John W.
Gates and George W. Perkins, at the of
fice of J. P. Morgan & Co., are regarded
with more than a little significance by
students of the situation. Gates had an
other talk with Perkins to-day, and soon
after President Spencer of the Southern
Hallway visited the Morgan Banking
House. j
John W. Gates and his associates are
reported to own or control more than
Suv.tXiO shares of Louisville and Nashville,
of which the total share capital is 600.0UO
shares. Some of this is on contracts for
delivery within the next three weeks. If
is not doubted that the Louisville and
Nashville-Southern Railway situation was
thoroughly discussed at the meeting be
tween Messrs. Perkins and Gates, but
with what result may not be known for
some dars."
Conservative opinion Inclines to the be
lief, however, .' that the Southern inter
ests will soon be found dominant in Louis
ville.
The strength of Illinois Central during
to-day's early session of the stock mar
ket gave rise to the belief in some quar
ters that the road would be found in con
trol of Louisville. The best information
fails to bear this out.
One of the afternoon reports had it that
Morgan & Co. had been asked to take
the Louisville matter in hand and effect
a settlement if the .terms of the Gates
faction Â¦- were not too onerous. On this
and all other matters all hands main
tained reserve. Perkins said that under
no circumstances woald he talk about the
matter, and Gates declared that Louis
ville was the one thing he must decline
to discuss. . Â¦ Â¦ .
"It. has been said, Mr. Gates, that you
and your friends control more than 300,000
shares of Louisville."
"I cannot prevent people from talking,"
was Gates' reply, "but I again tell you
that I am,not talking on this subject."
NEW YORK, April 14.â Countless j ru
mors dealing, with the reported change
of control 8f the Louisville and Nashville
road* were- current to-day, but nothing
in the way of an official, or semi-official
statement was obtainable.* .
The actions that will be brought will
probably be also two-fold in their object.
First, an effort will be made by Injunc
tion to restrain these great packing
houses from . combining to violate the
anti-trust law and interstate commerce
laws. Second, to prosecute criminally
persons who so combine for the purpose
of crushing competition and creating a
monopoly and raising the price of the
most important necessity of life.
Representative Newlands of Nevada to
day introduced a bill to remove all du
ties on beef imported from foreign coun
tries.
The evidence that is required in these
instructions is understood to be two-fold.
First,, it is desirable, to establish legal
proof of the existence of a combination
between the six great packing houses for
the purpose of controlling the beef and
provision trade of the country and for the
fixing of prices. Second, it is important
to have evidence that will hold In a court
as to whether this combination has di
vided the territory of the country and
designated sections in which one or more
shall exclusively operate, and, further,
whether in the matter of bidding there
has existed an understanding that there
shall be no competition, but that certain
designated firms shall have certain desig
nated contracts.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.,
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W WASHINGTON, April 14.â There will
be a fight to a finish in the prosecution
of the beef trust, and Attorney General
Knpx himself has said so. The Attorney
General to-day dropped all concealment
as to his Intentions. He sent to the
Committee on Judiciary a letter in which
he announced for the information of tha
committee that he had already taken
steps for the prosecution of this illegal
combination, thus confirming in every de
tail the news published In The Call or
Sunday morning. The Attorney General a
letter will not be made public until to
morrow, but It is understood to' be very
direct in detailing the purpose of the De
partment of Justice.
The news from Kansas City that ac
tion had been ordered and that a Fed
eral Grana Jury had been called is neither
confirmed nor denied. The belief here la
that proceedings have not reached a3
radical a step as that, but that the Dis
trict Attorneys at -Chicago, Omaha and
Kansas City have all been Instructed to
use the utmost diligence in procuring evi
dence which will enable the Government
to proceed without any risks of a mis
carriage of Justice for the smashing of
the trust.

BERLIN, April 14.â A violent thunder
storm, accompanied by heavy rain, broke
over Berlin and its vicinity early to-day,
causing much damage. - Many buildings
were struck by lightning. The fire brigade
.was summoned to upward of 300 places
to extinguish fires' and. cope with the

some of the waiting-rooms had to be
closed, as the walls threatened to fall.
A portion of the embankment' of the
Potsdam railroad near Schoeneburg was
swept away, and similar damage to the
circular railroad necessitated a suspen
sion of traffic.
The streets were so flooded' that the
cars in several districts' were abandoned
The streets were almost impassable for
pedestrians, and consequently the schools
were closed. The museum was consider

PITTSBURG, April 14.â William J. By
ers, a young man of prepossessing ap
pearance and manner, was, arrested to- -
day at his home in Kast Pittsburg for the
murderof August , Lay ton near Turk
Creek last spring. Byers was trapped -
through the agency of a" letter written to
a young woman - telling of his crime.
Byers confessed to having shot Layton
five times, and after a talk with the pris
oner Superintendent of Police McAleese
concluded that the killing was the result
of a conspiracy, and to-night ordered tho
arrest of Layton's widow, who la now
the wife of Frank -Williams of East Pitts
burg. Byers at one time boarded at the
Layton house in Turk Creek, and Is said
to have been Infatuated with Mrs. Lay
ton. His story, as told to the police au
thorities to-night, clearly Implicates the
woman in the murder. The murder of
Layton - last May was one of unsolvable
mystery to the-pollce.
Byers to-night broke down and con-,
fessed. "I killed Layton." said Byers to'
Detective McGovern, as he threw himself
on his breast. "For God's sake, save me.
I was in love with her and she loved me.
She hated her husband and said we must
kill him.. It was arranged on the night of
June 10 that I must kill him. I was to
accompany him to McKeesport and kill
him on the way.. When we were on the
farm of. Edward Taylor I stepped back of
him and . shot him in the head. Layton
fell to the ground. Then I put four shot3
in his head. I dragged the body to a
clump of bushes and threw brush over It.
I went to the home of Mrs. Layton and
spent the day and night with her. We
went to a dance that night and had a
good time together."

At the great socialist meeting which was

Brutality of the Police.
Except from Huy no reports of ' grave

the striking quarrymen had an encoun
ter with the gendarmes, in which several
men on both sides were injured. One
gendarme was fatally wounded and an
other escaped by swimming the river.
The Civic Guard formed in cordons
around the Maison du Peuple, and their
sensible attitude kept the crowd in good

to the strike. This has even extended to
the textile workers at Ghent.

DES MOINES, Iowa, April 14.â While
returning home from Highland Park
Methodist Church on the- northern out
skirts of the city last evening Mary Peter
son, 15 years of age, and Thomas Peter
son, aged 11 years, the children of Peter
J. Peterson, a well-to-do dairyman, were
murdered by some unknown person.' The
boy, when found at midnight, was alive
but died within fifteen minutes, not being
able to give a description of his assailant.
The bodies were discovered by a farmer
who overheard the moans of the lad. An
examination revealed that both children
had their heads crushed in.
The police so far are without a clew.
The body of the girl was found at the foot
of a telephone pole in a ditch two feet
deep. She had been criminally assaulted
by her assailant. At the base of the head
she had been hit with .some hard-Instru
ment, resulting in a fracture of the skull.
On the crown of the head there were four
or five indentations. . Not a brick or an
instrument can be found within the re
gion where the murders occurred. The
boy, who was found in the ditch on the
opposite side of the. road, was most cru
elly treated. A full half-dozen indentations
were made in the skull and his face also
showed evidence of being pounded.
The Peterson family consisted of seven
children, four girls and three boys. Two
of the girls now living declare that a
week ago they were chased at the same
spot by a man on their return during the
evening from Highland Park. They are
unable to give a description of the man.
Not far from the scene of the murder are
the Marauisville coal mines, in which
some 200 colored coal miners are employed.
It is the impression of the police that the
murderer was a resident of. Marquisville.
The tracks of two men have been found
leading from the scene and were followed
by the police, but they soon led into a
path where all trace was lost.

"I Owe My Life to the Wonderfn! and
Speedy Curative Powers of Paine's

Thousands of families to-day mourn tha
?css cf near and dear ones, -who, when
sickness first came upon them, were
forced to use other medicines instead of
the great disease banisher. Paine's Celery

The one remedy known to medicine that
can bring vigor, strength and permanent
health to the weak, run down, rheumatic,
neuralgic, dyspeptic and those burdened
with kidney and liver troubles, blood dis-
eases and derangements of the digestive
organism is Dr. Phelps' great medical
prescription, Paine's Celery Compound-.
"Weak, run down, sleepless and de-
spondent men and women will find in-
spiration and comfort in the following
letter written by Mr. K. J. Patterson of
Sheridan ville, Pa., who was fully restored,
to the blessings of life after use of the
great medicine that truly "makes sick
people well." Mr. Patterson say3:
"I was greatly troubled with insomnia
and felt as tired in the morning as whea
I went to bed. I finally lost my appetit*.

It would appear from these reportsthat about' the
only legislation on the subject to be expected at this
The difficulty in the way of action seems to have
arisen from the conflict between the supporters of the
Nicaragua route, and that of Panama. The struggle
between I the: two parties' may -make a orolonged: de
bate, and it is to avoid such a contingency that a
considerable number of Senators who are interested
in other measures are willing to postpone the canal
question to the next session, or, possibly, to the, next
ConVress. : â
Against that view, is the statement that Senator
Morgan and other uncompromising supporters of
the Hepburn bill will make a strong fight to raise the
question at once. So, too, Senator Allison is reported
to have stated recently that he has no doubt'that the
Senate will adopt some definite legislation concern
ing the canal at this session. - \.
REPORTS from Washington concerning the
outlook, for the passage of the isthmian canal
bill at this session of Congress are contra
dictory, and by no. means reassuring to the hopes of
those who expected to see the great work under
taken in earnest. According to one statement the
Republican steering committee- of the Senate has :
virtually decided to postpone all consideration of the
measure until the next session, but according to an
other, some' of the most influential Republicans in
the Senate have declared that the issue will by no
means be postponed: Â¦ ..
One of the reasons given for the belief that the
bill will be postponed is the known desire of at least,
six members of the steering committee to give the'
Philippine civil government bill, the Cuban reciproc
ity bill, the river, and harbor bill and the various sup--
I'ly bi!ls precedence overall other'measures, and it is
said that course will compel a postponement of the'
canal bil;, unless the session should be greatly pro
longed.

ments in. regard to certain water rights
you would have the advantages of a first
appropriator, but if .you used " water for
thirty years without having complied with
such requirements that would ' not give
you any standing. . If you believe that
you are right and some one else is seek
ing to prevent you from using water as
you : have been doing in the. past your
remedy is an action in court,' when your
rights will be determined upon the evi

MARRIAGEâ P. S., Martinez, Cal. Par
ties divorced in California may go at" any
time within a year after the decree to the
State of Washington 1 and there remarry,
but it is not yet certain if such a mar
riage would be legal. There has been one
decision which upholds such marriages on
the ground that a marriage that is valid
in another State or country is valid in this
State, while the other decision is against
it, on the ground that 'going to another
State to marry is an evasion' of the law of
California,' which inhibits a divorcee from
marrying within a year after the decree.

The influence of a harmonious convention will
stimulate and inspire all loyal Republicans. It will
revive the spirits of the old stalwarts and veterans of
the party and quicken the ardor of young Republicans
so that they will open the campaign with vim and
vigor and carry it on with a- rush from the primaries
to election day. That fact appears to be well under
stood by the great gathering at San Jose. The efforts
of the bosses to win a factional success at the risk of
giving rise to dissensions willfindno encouragement
from any considerable number of the delegates. It is
to be a convention whose watchword will be: "Every
thing for Republicanism and nothing for faction,"
and in the same spirit the great host of loyal Repub
licans throughout California will hail its proceedings
with satisfaction, and enter upon the task of making
the campaign a walkover and the election a clean
sweep. . . >_,\y
Fortunately,* as we have said, the outlook for the
San Jose convention is bright with promise of har
mony. That there -will be differences of opinion on
minor questions is of course to be expected, but upon
the vital issues of the time the? thousands of dele
gates at the convention should be as one. They have
met to represent the Republican clubs of the State,
and the ciubs have no other object than to promote
Republican success. They were not organized to help
nor to hinder the aspirations or ambitions of any par-',
ticular candidate or set of candidates. Their one po
litical devotion is to Republicanism, and their one de
sire is to promote the harmony and the unity of pur
pose that will carry the whole party united ipto the
field when the campaign opens, and every voter to!
the polls on election day.
With Gage and his gang eliminated from the field
there is every assurance of a sweeping and easy Re
publican victory in this State â a victory that will
carry the Congressional and the county tickets as well
as the State ticket It is a Republican year, for Re
publican prosperity prevails throughout the country,
and the opponents of protection and sound money
are demoralized and divided. Nothing, therefore, can
defeat the Republican party in California except the
capture of the party conventions by those notorious
bosses arid railroad tools, whom the people know well
and whose candidates they will not support.
The only danger that menaces Republicanism in
California at this juncture is the avowed determina
tion of the bosses to procure the renomination of
Gage, and the secret and underhand tactics employed
by the corporations to bring about the adoption of
Assembly constitutional amendment No. 28. It was
at one time the intention of Billy Herrin and his
gang to make an effort to obtain from the league con
vention an indorsement" of Gage's candidacy. The
outburst of protest from the Republican 'press of the
State and from the rank and file of stalwart Republi
cans has served to warn the more intelligent bosses
of the folly of 'such an attempt. The indorsement of
Gage would have no other effect than that of disclos
ing the power of the bosses, and so far from helping
Gage's candidacy it would rouse genuine Republicans
to more earnest efforts to defeat him in the State
HARMONY amorg the representative Republi
cans now in convention at San Jose will have
a potent effect in developing a like spirit
among the rank and file of the party throughout the
State. On the other hand any discord or -dissension
there-will have 1 a -tendency to rouse a factional spirit
everywhere. To the convention,- therefore, the party
looks with expectation, and it is gratifying that the
proceedings of yesterday give every assurance that
from the convention there will flow a thousand in
fluences to unite and encourage the party, and not
one to divide or, dismay it

All of those facts are going to be brought out dur
ing the debate. , .The Republican party is going to
have an object lesson on the folly of tariff tinkering,
and it is to be hoped the leaders of the House /will
profit by it. ' .
-Equally futile will be the plea that the adoption of
the bill will not be. injurious to the sugar and the to
bacco growers of the United States. That sort of
argument has been, he^rd too often.from themouths
of free traders and the advocates of tariff for revenue\
only, and has been tco completely refuted not only
by Republican arguments, but by. the experience of
the Wilson' tariff, for it to have any convincing power
with the mass of genuine protectionists. During the
hearings on the bill in committee that argument was
used, b.ut the representatives of the Grange
and of other associations of. farmers frankly refused
to admit' its validity. -They claimed for farming in
terests as full protection as is given to other interests,
and.the claim is not to be' disputed.
Even as it is, with* a divided party, the Democrats
of the Hou$e will be able to put the Republicans in
an equivocal position on the" tariff question, should
the Cuban bill be adopted.' 'It will not be .easy to
explain to farmers why agricultural interests should
be exposed to foreign competition, while manufactur
ing industries are carefully guarded. The plea>that
the bill must be'passed because\of our moral obliga
tions to Cuba will not deceive the common sense of
the people The United States, by establishing the
independence of Cuba, providing for a stable govern
ment and securing the blessing of peace to the island,
has given the Cubans all. the opportunities for pros
perity they have any, right to expect. The mainte
nance of their industries should be left to their own
energies, and not be. made dependent upon our
charity. <Â¦
In this juncture it is fortunate for the Republican
party that the Democrats are demoralized and divided
even on the tariff question. Were they united the
opening that has been given by the introduction of
this bill and its support by a majority of the Repub
licans of the House would enable them to make an
attack with such success as would lead up to a pro
longed agitation for a revision of the tariff as a
whole. Having seen one reciprocity scheme adopted,,
to the injury of thefarmers, they- could go before the
country this fall and make a strong and possibly a
winning fight for further reductions'.
/"^ HOULD the expectations of Washington be
realized, the debate' on the Cuban reciprocity
bill in the House this week will give the coun
try a striking illustration' of the danger of making
any opening whatever in the solid wall of protection
which now guards Ariierican industries. The debate)
it is said, is "to proceed withput rule," arid conse
quently the Democrats intend to offer a large number
of amendments, with a view to preparing the way for
further reductions of. protective duties. The amend
ments will doubtlessbe defeated, but none the less
the logic of the argument will be with the men who
ask why duties should be reduced on great agricul
tural staples like sugar and tobacco, and not on other
articles as well. ' "

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
HERR 'ANSCHUTZ-KAMPFE of Vienna has praptically
completed his plans for the most remarkable of Arctic
explorations, in .which he will actually attempt to reach
the north pole by means of a submarine boat, says the
New. York .World. â¢ â¢ :
It was: Herr Anschutz-Kampfe who invented the boat and
he is very hopeful of success. \ ,
..When the Austrian scientist first brought his project be
fore, the Geographical Society assembled at Vienna, a year
ago, it was looked upon as visionary. One objection after an
other was raised, and there were many who regarded the idea
as simply preposterous. -
Herr Anschutz-Kampfe, however, like Columbus, . was con
vinced of the feasibility of his idea and he did nor give up be
cause scientific men thought unfavorably Of it.
/.. By applying first to one capitalist and then to another, by
the hardest kind of work, backed by the greatest amount of
determination, he. has at last succeeded in raising the neces
sary capital to build his submarine vessel.
&j He first brought his scheme to the attention of the Impe
rial Geographical Society, through which he was brought in
contact with men of great wealth. Among those who helped
him were the Archduke Ranier, Leopold Salvator, Baron Ator,
aide-de-camp to the Emperor; Field Marshal Grober and Gen
eral'Prince Windisch-Graetz. -
The explorer also obtained Government aid for his venture.
The boat is now awaiting the finishing touches at Wil
helmshaven, Germany,' and the crew of daring navigators, five
in number, who will risk their lives for the sake, of glory are
ready to go aboard whenever, the summons comes.
While 'the Idea of reaching the pole by a submarine route
Is not original with Herr Anschutz-Kampfeji he is the first to
seriously undertake the. building of a boat designed for the
purp6se. , , r _
Jules Verne, in. "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the
Sea," long ago outlined the submarine north pole scheme, and
other men since, notably Albert Riedel of Baltimore, have dis
cussed the project seriously.- Riedel was a, friend of Nansen,
Stanley, Wissman and other explorers. .' Â¦Â¦' Â¦ .
Anschutz-Kampfe's boat is seventy feet long and twenty
feet in diameter and looks not unlike an egg.
; The outer hull and the framework of the craft are of steel.
The boat Is made especially for supporting a great compressive
weight of water. -'Â¦Â¦. "i

PERSONAL MENTION,
"I do not consider Anschutz-Kampfe's scheme at all feasi
ble. The' submarine boat proposition is not even worked out
sufficiently well at homeâ under the best conditionsâ to think
of trying to reach the pole by its means. When a submarine
boat can go j more than 1000 miles in our own waters I shall
look for some such achievementâ not before. It is,' for one
thing, a matter of fuel. That problem has first to be . solved.
Moreover, the conditions of the ice below the surface are not
known. Off Spitzbergen is. a very dangerous place to experi
ment." Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ ' . * . . Â¦Â¦ * .
Almert Brldgeman of the Arctic Club said, "I do not think
very much of the submarine scheme." . .'... . . .
'In order to obviate this difficulty it was necessary for'ths
submarine explorer to. select a place in the Arctic seas free
from the large Icebergs. This point lies off Spitsbergen and. is.
about 600 miles from the pole. Here the ice, according, to Nan
sen, is about thirty feet in average thickness, seldom .more
than that. -
From Spitzbergen to the pole the iqe is not one solid sheet,
but is broken up every four or five miles by crevices. . './Â¦
Herr Kampfe's boat will contain sufficient compressed air
to remain under water fifteen hours. At its speed of threa
miles an hour.it will make in that â¢ time, barring accidents,
forty-five miles. . Â¦ â¢ . ..
Arctic experts in this country have been asked" for ex
pressions of opinion on the submarine plans. . ' . M- â."
Albert White Vorse, who was a member of the Peary re
lief expedition of 1892, said: f . *. . - 1 :.
"Anschutz-Kampfe' a plan is just not preposterous. The
depth of the lea north of Spitzbergen is not very great,
never more than eighty-five or ninety feet, and as his boat
can go to a depth of 160 feet and can remain down fifteen houra,
there is a ghost of a chance of his reaching" the pole. Every
thing in polar navigation has been triedâ balloons and ships â
why not the submarine?" ! ; = . Â¦ .â¢:
Frederick A.' Cook, M.D., author of "Through thÂ© First
Antarctic Night," who has organized' -several Arctic and
Antarctic expeditions, said: <?

required to navigate at this depth for any greats length; or
tline. Â¦-, 4Â» â¢" -Â¦â¢ " -'Â¦':
When the submarine project was first mooted It was point
ed out that Anschutz-Kampfe would be required, to.
under a large iceberg, to go to a depth of several hundred feet.
An iceberg which projects 100 feet above the surface of the
water '.'draws" 600 feet of water.

When its dreams come true and it is in power, as
it may easily be, it will be our first experience with
the representation of one interest, one class, if you
please, in the government. Students of civics will
contemplate the scene with interest,' and history will
get ready a new page to be over-written with the
story of a novelty in government.
It must not be forgotten that the labor leaders have
been training in administration. The management of
some of the vast federations requires as much genius
of leadership as has been shown in any matter by
anybody in the history of the republic. The elements
they must control are crude and stiff-necked. They
are gathered from the ends of the earth, and a ma
jority of them are not trained under our institutions,
or indeed under any institutions that teach men self
discipline. This vast mass of men is consolidated, and
it has never- yet happened that such a consolidation
has abstained from attempting to gain political power.
There be those who shudder at the prospect of such
attempt here. But shuddering will not avert, nor
temper its use of what it gains. So it may easily come
to pass that the country will look with gratitude and
confidence to the leaders of this consolidation to pre
vent its intoxication from its first taste of power.
Henry George was too early. Had he survived tie
would have to-day moved through the States' as a
king making progress through his provinces.
i J Present conditions.: are evidence that forces once in
action, .and affecting" the material condition of men,
cannot be arrested. , Be they. harmful or helpful, like
a ferment they must work until they are spent or the
material oh which they feed is exhausted.
In a popular Government all differences must be
finally thrashed out, and to the thrashing floor all
must come who- have the power to get there. Dennis
Kearney was merely premature with his movement.
He fired the first gun and its effects seemed to die
with its echoes. . But it is now apparent that he
pioneered in a path ii; which many are destined to
walk toward the goal that he saw in the seventies.
It has among its possibilities the control of a ma
jority of the Northern State governments, and of
Congress. So it is not likely that this power will be
long farmed out. It will be used for the benefit of
its creators. ;As this is human, it need not be quar
reled with. There be many who are not in labor
unions who think that it is better that these appear
in government as principals and not by proxy, and
all who feel that way will impose few difficulties in
the way of the new master to his place of power.
Both patties will strive to meet this emergency,
whose elements have radiated from San Francisco, by
giving nominations to labor leaders.' But this policy
will not long endure. It implies an alliance irksome
to all who are party to it. The tests made. of their
strength so far have convinced the labor leaders that
they stand a better chance when they stand alone."- As
far as organization goes, theirs is perfect. Their sys
tem of national federation and local affiliation has
never been attained by the best political organizers.
Nor has it ever occurred that a membership of as
many millions in a political party has ever been as
unanimous in principle and purpose. Why should
those who control such an organization lend it to
either of the old parties? â¢
There is an irresistible charm in power. Men who
exercise it through agents are seldom long content
with.a proxy, and the cabinet of labor leaders which
controls events in Washington is beginning to re
flect upon .the -greater ease with which it could con
trol its -own destiny and dictate that of others, by
holding the offices whose incumbents it now directs.
Then, these strong men, like all strong me'n, grow
tired of subserviency. They get weary of compelling
men to give up all their own ideas and convictions
and take as errands the carrying out of the ideas of
others in which they do not believe, because they
fear the power that dictates. These observations have
made their impression, and ambition, always coupled
with a consciousness of power, is asserting its' pres
ence. At the same time there is a tendency toward
independent action, heretofore unknown. . ,
The. two, political parties of the country are watch
ing the spread of: this movement with keen interest.
Even in Congress they are bidding against each other
for the favor of organized labor, which "has only to
ask for' what it wants, if it doesn't see it.bn the Con
gressional' bargain counter. It may be said with
confidence that legislation is now subject to the dic
tation of labor unions. But the office holders who
obey that, powerful influence need not be' reassured
that their calling and re-election are made, certain
thereby, f Warwick may want to be king.
THE pace in politics seems to have been set by
San Francisco in electing Mr.Schmitz Mayor.
Three of the larger 'towns of Connecticut have
elected to that-omce labor leaders, to the surprise of
both parties, and it is, now confidently expected that
the next Governor of Connecticut will be a labor
leader. - - .

one that is to follow.
That method" would leave the issue in a somewhat
indefinite condition, but in the hands of a President
sol energetic as Roosevelt it would not remain /.in
definite for any great length of time. It is safe to {say
the determination of the route would be made by, him
much more quickly than .it would be made bj r the
Senate; and accordingly, the; public would be well
pleased to . see the. Spooner . resolution adopted.
The Call has already pointed out that v the delay of
the Senate \ in dealing with . the bill has enabled
the antagonists of the canal to array a new opposition
to it, and-the victory which a year ago seemed cer
tain is now becoming doubtful. It is* time ', for the
commercial and industrial interests of the country to
renew their petitions to â¢ Congress for immediate ac
tion. A postponement of the bill at this session
would mean a postponement to the next Congress,
for if the measure' cannot be carried during the long
session there will be little chance for it in the short
session"., is -the! passage of the Spooner resolution,"
which directs the President to determine through the,
Department of Justice whether or not the Colombian
Government, in co-operation with the French com
pany, can make a clear title to the Panama: canal
property, and if so: the President as to purchase that "
property in accordance 'with the revised; recornmen
dation;of the United States Isthmian Canal Co'mmis- |
sion and proceed with the work of completing the
waterway. If, on the contrary, itas discovered that
a clear title to the property cannot be given, the
Spooner resolution empowers the President to pro
ce'ed with the construction of a canal, along;the Nica

HONOLULU. April 8.â After * about
eighteen . years of schism â¢ the Episcopal
church here appears to be one congrega
tion again. On April 1 Bishop Alfred Wil
lis, who has held the bishopric for thirty
yeans? laid down the reins of government,
which he has held as a British appointee
under the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
Bishop Nichols of California accepted the
church in the name of the Protestant
Episcopal Church of the United States.
In spite of the church had
remained British up to this time.
The ceremonies of the withdrawal of
one Bishop and assumption of power by
the other were attended by a large con
gregation. On last Sunday the first serv
ices under the new authority were held,
Bishop Nichols preaching. Members of
both the congregations, which have for
years past held different services at dif
ferent hours every Sunday morning and
evening, were present, and the two choirs
were mingled. Bishop Nichols announced
his assignments of clergy.
, The Rev. Alexander Mackintosh, whom
Bishop Willis recently deposed, waa re
stored as a canon and took part In the
service. The Rev. V. H. Kitcat, who has
been a Willis man, participated with him.
Bishop Nichols is himself dean, though
Willis had made Kitcat dean under the
old regime. It is thought that the con
gregations will unite hereafter, under, the
new American Bishop, whose election has
probably already taken place on the
mainland. Bishop." Nichols will return to
California when the new Bishop comes.
Ho still has to deal with the Rev. J. Us

without the pale by Bishop Willis. The
action to be taken with regard to them
bas not been authoritatively announced,
but it has been said that the Bishop will
restore them to good church standing.

We. are making every exertion to induce
every foreign government of importance to par

Two of the foreign governments that have
formerly declined the invitation of the Presi
dent to participate in our exposition have been
asked to reconsider, and our Information is to
the effect that they conclude to do so.
Neither the beard of director! nor the execu
tive committee has taken any formal action
concerning a postponement of the exposition.
It seems impossible to prevent agitation on the
subject. Personally I should prefer the ex
position to be held in 1004.
We are making excellent progress in the
physical work, and although we have met with
some slight disappointment in promotion and
exploitation we have every reason to be en
couraged by the pi-esent status. As stated by
me Saturday our contracts and expenses up to
this time are in excess of our available funds.
We cannot expect an additional payment from
the etockholders before September 2. We have
collected 50 per cent of the $5,000,000 sub
scriptions, and' that amounts to only $2,500,000,
which Is much less than the aggregate of ex
penditures and outstanding contracts. We are
therefore depÂ«lding on the proceeds of the sale

troller have Informed me will be advertised in

victim, the tissues may grow together
properly, but It Is doubtful, as the bones
were cut In two below the knees. The
father was mowing barley and did not
know his child was playing in tha tall
grain until she screamed.

It Is not altogether certain that Miss

the matter must be referred to the Sis

they would not object to further aid,
though their wishes will be considered by
the board. President Sloggett stated that
tho board had no objection, but that tha
Sisters and Bishop XJulstan should first
be consulted as to whether they desired
any further assistance. If a favorable
reply Is received the Board of Health will
return such an answer to the request.

SELECTIONS FOB. TO-DAY.
Endowed with speed to burn. Lass of
Langdon, a 9 to 5 favorite, came home
by herself in the concluding sprint. In
a drive Our Lizzie led â¢ out Prestano a
neck for the place.
Almost all of the dangerous quantities,
among them Eonic, Redwald, Captain
Gaines and Marshal Neil, were scratched
from the mile selling affair. This left
Obia to go out a 3 to 5 choice, and she won
at leisure from Antolee. Rio Shannon
ran a disappointing race.
Golden Light, favorite for the seven fur
long number, had some early speed, but
failed to stay the .route. Johnny Hoar
on Ada N, a 6 to 1 shot, moved up by
degrees from seventh position, crossing
the line half a length before the pace
maker Varro. Billy Moore dropped In
third. ; . Â¦-Â¦" Y
It looked like asking a good deal of
Plan with his rickety underpinning to
carry 122 pounds, still the field was very
commonplace and the gelding went to the
post a 6 to 5 chance for the mile and a
furlong run. The pace set was slow, and
Vlckery astride El Fonse led from start
to finish. Brutal closed well under Con
ley's hard urging, losing by a neck only.
Plan gave it up completely in' the stretch,
Lena downing him for third place.
Oro Viva, the Golden Garter colt, ap
peared to better advantage with Troxler
up. Played from 4 down to 13 to 5 In the
betting on the . 2-year-old ' dash, he col
lared and beat Lizzie Rice, the favorite,
a nose. The show went to Amoruna.
Yrsula, the entry of James Nealon,
with Conley up, showed to be much the
best of the eleven entries In the intro
ductory sprint. She went to the post a.n
11 to 10 favorite, and after getting away
cone too well, won handily from Azarine,
a 40 to 1 shot. Knocklngs ran third again.
THE departure for other parts of
most of the-high-priced Jockey,
talent apparently made no mate
rial difference, with the sport at
Oakland yesterday. Troxler, Con
ley and Hoar are now the stars, and the
services of all three are in great demand.
Vickery on El Fonse' furnished' the sen
sation by landing the cast-off first in the
third event at odds of 15 to L' Yrsula,
Obia and Lass of Langdon held up the
reputation of " the favorites by getting
home first at fair quotations.

"Beauty is but skin-
deep 7> was probably meant
to disparage beauty. In-
stead it tells how easy
that .beauty is to attain.
"There is no beauty
'like the beauty of health"
was also meant to dis-
parage. Instead it encour-
ages beauty.
Pears' Soap is the means
of health to the skin, and
so to both these sorts of
beauty.

HONOLULU, April 8.-At the last mo
ment both the Republican and Home Rule
Republican parties nominated candidates
for tho special election to be held to.
morrow in the Fourth Representative Dis
trict to elect a successor to the late A. F.
Gllflllan. The Republicans named W. W.
Harris, a young member of fhe firm of
Lewers & Cooke. August Dreier Is the
nominee of the Home Rulers and has been
Indorsed by the Democrats. Dreier is a
German by birth and was naturalized
about' a year ago. i
After Dreier's nomination had been filed
with Secretary Cooper it was found that
his name was not on the registration list
for the Fourth District, and the claim
was made that he was therefore not qual
ified to sit as Representative. A protest
was made against his name being placed
on the official ballot, but Cooper took the
position that it was not his duty to con
sider the qualifications of candidates, but
only to place on ..the .ballots the names
of all who were properly nominated. The
matter was appealed" 7 to 'â¢" "the- Supreme
Court and Cooper was sustained. (
In spite of the general belief that the
man elected will never take his seat, as
the present Legislature probably will not
meet again, there is quite a lively can
vass for vdtes. The Democrats made ob
jections to a plank in the Home Rule Re
publican platform which indorsed the Re
publican administration, whereupon the
Home Rulers stated that they had refer
ence to the administration of Hawaiian
affairs only. The platform was amended
to more clearly express this idea, and
the Democrats who were rebelling against
the charts. The plane of reference Is the mean
ot the lower low waters. Â¦ â¢â¢ -.

SAX BERNARDINO, April 14.â Four
burglaries in this city and one in Colton,
a near-by town, were reported to the po
lice to-day. AH the houses entered are
occupied by the wealthy class. The
largest haul was made at the Colton
home of E. D. Roberts, ex-president of
the San Bernardino National Bank.
Mrs. Roberts was awakened early this
morning by a noise in her room and
awakened her husband. Upon investiga
tion it was discovered that a burglar waa
retreating from the bedroom. Roberts
commanded the burglar to throw up his
hands, which he did, but kept backing 1
away until he reached the door, when he
turned and ran. He took with him jew
elry to the value of $230.
Four houses were entered In this city,
including those of J, T. Oakey. J. , B.
Frith, James Fleming and John Barton,
all among the finest residences in the
city. A small amount of jewelry and
money was obtained at each place and $35
in cash was taken from Carton's pocket.

STOCKTON, April 14.-Mrs. M. K. Man
ley of this city, mother of Clinton Man
ley, who shot -Bert Patton at Carters,
says that. Lulu Curtis, second cousin ot
Patton, was doubtless the cause of the
tragedy. Patton is in love with her, but
she cared nothing for him. while she and
Manley were quite friendly. Manley, who
Is well known here, has a reputation for
not permitting any one to slander a
woman In his presence. It te believed the
shooting â¢ was caused by some slighting
remarks made by Patton about the girl.
Manley, is about 27 years old and Patton
23. Both are six-footers. Manley was
never known to carry a revolver.'.
loung Manley said this afternoon, thai
Patton had made threats against his life
previous to the encounter. Anticipating
trouble, , Manley armed himself with a
revolver.' The young. man admits having
tired the first shot, but Claims that it was
done In his own defense. The whole quar
rel, so Manley claims, arose over Patton
slandering a young, lady with whom hÂ«
was' keeping company. Manley is now
out on bail. -
The trouble between the two is said to
have arisen over the; attentions paid by
Manlty to. a , young, lady residing here.
Maniey comes trom StocKton, wnere his
mother,- Mrs. to. K.v Maniey, resides in
the Cortiand rooming -house. The. young
man has Leen here some time in the em

TACOMA, Wash., April- 14.â Henry
Bratnobcr. the noted but close-mouthed
mibing expert of San Francisco, is again
visiting^ Puget Sound. He has represented
the London Exploration Company in this
country for years and has made numer
ous' trips for that London concern, in
which the English branch of the Roths
childs family are large stockholders. The
object of Uratnober's present visit to th<;
Northwest was unknown until to-day s
mail from Skagway brought the news
tlfat Jack Dalton has bonded his copper
claims in the upptr itainy Hollow district,
\id\ ond Porcupine, to the .London Ex
ploration Company for $125,000. John Vick
trs has also given a working bond on his
property in Uainy Hollow, presumably to
SVatnoDer's company. In July, 1S97, Brat
nober was jumped by cable orders from
Western Australia to facoma ana ordeitd
by the London Exploration Company to
investigate the Kionaike. Keturniug trom
Dawson he walked out over the 'Oaiton
trail, picking up Mail Carrier Carr, who
had become lost- Bratnober then noticeJ
some rich copper prospects adjacent to
wjjat subsequently became the Rainy
Hollow discoveries. He has since main
tained an active interest in that section,
and at one time contemplated building a
railway inland from Pyramid Harbor. Â¦
Later he experted the Treadwell gold
mines and arranged for their purchase by
the corporation which now controls them.
Close Puget Sound acquatntam.es ot
Eratnober have learned that he made a
large fortune on one of his recent trips to
Western Australia. lie and another min
ing man are reported to have exparteu a
large mine, the stock of which had great
ly declined by unfavorable reports in the
London market. They cabled orders for
large stock purchases and then took hold
of the mine and opened up new ore
bodies. The stock again went soaring and
tbeir clean-up resulted.

Major Charles Jensen, formerly In com
mand of a battalion of thÂ© First Califor
nia Regiment, was there to support a
charge of insanity against his aged father.
The father denounced the son, saying that
he was trying to rob him of his fortune
by sending him to an Insane asylum on a
trumped-up charge.'
Major Jensen denied the accusations of
the old man. He said he brought him
here from New York ten years ago and
has been supporting him ever since. Not
withstanding the old man had everything
he wanted, he went begging among the
people, bringing disgrace upon his family.
Daniel Woolley and Major Jensen's two
married daughters related how the old
man growled like a dog and threatened
to exterminate them ail. Woolley had a
struggle with him- when he tried to sup
press him, and came near getting cut
with a big knife In Jensen's hands.

the proposition of the Santa Fe .Railroad

the building of a proper depot. At the
meeting Trustee Ryder moved that the

board that a $50,000 bond be exacted for
the performance of this work in con

adopted.
Trustee Staats moved as a substitute
that the ' report be received and filed and !
Trustee Rickard moved that it then be
indefinitely postponed. These two latter
motions were carried, and this means that
the Berkeley Trustees will not grant the

n.. m. and 4:30 p. rn., and 6:30 p. m and
9:30 p. m., and was referred to the Street
Committee. \
Ordinances were finally passed as fol
lows:
In order to test this matter. I would advise
that you select some district not now covered
by water mains and where there is no suffi
cient fire protection â nor any. if such a dis
trict can be Sound â and erect therein one or
more hydrants. Following the placing of thesa
hydrants you should make demand upon the.
Spring Valley Water Works that it make con
nection between Each hydrants and its nearest
main. The district selected should be fairly
populous and the hydrants should be in posi
tion at the time when demand is made, which
demand chould be made in the name of the
city and county by formal action of the Board
of Supervisors. Care should be taken in the
selection of the district, so as to avoid as many
defences as possible. The district, for in
stance, should not be at an exceptional eleva
tion which would require an unusual water
pressure to supply, nor should it be removed at
a great distance from already existing mains,
and it should be one where eewers run through
the streets and manholes or cesspools are built,
throuch which the sewers may be flushed. The
demand should not only read that water is re
quired for purposes of fire protection, but also
for sewer cleaning, street sprinkling and other
purposes. "'
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion
with the Beard of Supervisors yesterday
advising 1 what steps are to be taken to,

NEW YORK. April 14.â There was a feverish
Â«nd excited close in to-day's stock market after
a day of varying sentiment. The early strength
was not maintained, in spite of wide advances
in a few stocks, and the course was gradually
downward under the late dealings, when there
was a general break all around. Prices had
risen atain after the sagging tendency under
the stimulus of the extraordinary advances In
some of the grangers and northwesterns. But
the perception of realizing under cover of this
strength and the sensational advance to 133
In Louisville and Xaabvllle unsetUed senti
ment again and led to the general unloading
lr. the nnal dealings. There were some fever
ish and spasmodic rallies, but the market
closed feverish and irregular with a weak un
dertone. Much attention and surmise were
given to the Louisville and Nashville situa
tion end the dlspoEition to be made of its con
trol, which is now wi^out dissent understood
to have escaped its long-time holders. Some
oope is entertained that a community of in
terest among the Southern trunk lines will be
worked out as a result of the new control,
m-hlch eeems to have been acquired without
*ny large railroad policy In view, but -simply
for speculative profit*. It is patent that great
financial and railroad interests arÂ« now striving
to readjust the situation from the standpoint
ef railroad policy, which necessitates a settle
ment to the satisfaction of the interest which
b&s 6*cured the control almost by chance. The
Action of the etock to-day did not indicate any
very definite prospect of settlement, the fever
l*h flight of the etock Indicating rather pro
found unsettlement and uncertainty of the
speculative mind. The remarkable rise In
Northwestern granger* was without explana
tion, unless it was the result of pure manipu
lation to further profit-taking at other points.
The " Chicago and Northwestern stocks, St.
Paul and Omaha, and the St. Paul stocks 'were
marked up in a short period of trading from
2>i to 13 points. St. Paul relapsed as sud
denly to below Saturday and fluctuated at the
ljirt almost as -wildly as Louisville Itself. The
tnoaey market was appreciably lower, as a
result of the stronger condition of the banks
as revealed by Saturday's statement. But the
extent to which outstanding credits are in
volved In the great speculative operations go-
Ing on in the stock market is not entirely satis
factory to the conservative minds and was thÂ«
â¢ubject of much comment and eome criticism
to-<5ay. Report* of rain Jn the winter wheat
belt were predictive of eome buying of stocks
and report* were received of a heavy mer
chandise movement on western railroads In
vpite of the eh-unken proportions of the grain
movement. The February statement of Mis
Â¦ouri Pacific did not erne to corroborate this
view. The peace rumors from London helped
the early Â«trength In the market, although the
buying from that source seemed to be In the
nature of reinvestment of the proceeds of
Louisville and Nashville etock sold. The bud
get statement came too late for direction and

EASTERN MARKETS. *
CHICAGO. April 14.â Shorts in the corn pit
were the cause of the panicky actions in
grains. At the start there was an Inclination
to sell stuff because of the easy feeling in
wheat. It took only a few spurts of the St.
Louis market, however, to create a strong de
mand by the unfortunate early sellers. The
naturally bullish situation in the corn trade,
with continued reports of depletions of stocks
at all prominent centers and an improving de
mand, scared the shorts badly. The : rumor
that was started in March of a possible corner
was renewed again and a hot start resulted.
Great buying force was under the cereal and
prices rushed up 2c almost before the market
was well under way. May opened %c higher
to %c lower at 61%c to 61%c and Jumped to
6JV2C. This was an advance of about 6c over
the low price on the decline of a week or ten
days ago and of almost 4c since Saturday
morning. St. Louis was buying here sup
posedly to finish the covering of the big short
line begun Saturday. Offerings were not
enough to supply the demand. Everybody in
the pit was nervous. Trade was guesswork all
around. After the early excitement there was
considerable selling by people who thought
corn had all the twist needed for the present Â¦
Business quieted down and as wheat reacted
from its- sympathetic higher prices corn eased
Liquidation at top prices brought good profits.
There was a good demand for the cash article
which, together with strong cables, helped in
putting a bullish interpretation : on every bit
of news. Traders in all pits were talking of
the remarkable outlook for speculation and
manipulation in corn. News continues to ar
rive of farmers feeding corn to stock because
the advanced prices in cattle and hogs make
good profits. May corn at Southwestern mar
kets is lc to l%c over Chicago prices The
country traders say, must have Chicago corn
âand there is 1 little of that. After high prices
May corn Bold off to 61% c . but rallied again
and closed strong, %c up, at 62>4c. *,"
Wheat started out with a- sickly aspect on
unresponsive cables and rains in the South
western wheat country. May opened %c to
J*c lower. at 72%c to 73c, but at once felt the
influence of the soaring corn market. In a
very short time - covering and an Investment
demand Bent May to 73%c. As corn began its
decline after the opening bulge wheat eased
oftV Then a big line was sold for a leading
bull professional and as the "tallers" filed In
to sell the market slumped oft below Satur
day's close. The Southwest sold here and
those markets were lower. Commission houses
were on both sides of the mamet, but princi
pally sold. Liquidation for profits was very
popular. The visible decrease of 1.800,000
bushels was a little more than expected but
had no effect., Trade was active. May closed
weak at Its lowest price, %c pff, at 7294c Â¦
Â¦ Trade in oats was fair and on the corn ln-
J, ue , nce P rlce s advanced. May closed %c up at
4x%C.
Provisions had a fair general trade. â¢ May
pork closed 5c up. May lard a shade lower
and ribs 5chlgher. Â¦ .'/'.-- ' â¢Â¦â¢-Â¦Â¦

Professor's Love Story," delight
fully given by E. S. Willard and his col
leagues at the Columbia Theater last
night. The scenes are laid In Arcadyâ
mistakenly spelt "London" and "Tulloch
mains" on the programme â and the time
is when you will. -
The story is all about a dear, dreamy,
old-young professor falling in love with
a butterfly maid who has fluttered to his
desk one fine morning as his secretary.
There is a wicked young widow with cap
tlvatlngly unscrious schemes against the
professor's peace; and a whimsical step
son and daughter-in-law who are anxious
to settle her !n life.
There are two sons of the same Utopian
soil who addjargely to the joys of living,
and a fair maid whose wooing by them is
a rare and gracious piece of fooling. Two
merry doctors complete the cast.
Around these fanciful folk Barrle has
woven a delicately fantastic comedy, with
the quaint air of realism that some fairy
stories have. The play is kept admirably
in key, the work of the actors through
out being remarkable for its consistency.
Mr. Willard as the professor is an ex
quisite thing. Absent-minded, learned,
lovable, a fine gentleman and uncon
sciously in love, the professor, as Mr.
Willard paints him. Is an irresistible fig
ure. His unconsciousness of his love for
the pretty secretary is sublime, his quaint
humility when he does discover it truly
patheticâ In an Arcadian wayâ and the
whole picture conspicuous for rich and
genial humor, brilliant lightness of hand
ling and masterly finish.
VERT far from the madding crowd,
the pomps and vanities of this
wicked world, is the delightful

Between 7 and 8 o'clock on the same
evening the witness went with Dimmick
to Cole's house. Cole being sick in bed,
and Dimmick remarked to the witness
that it was too bad. because all the em
ployes would be suspected of having taken
the money, but he himself had no fear
because he and Mr. Leach could swear
that the money was there on the preced-,
ing evening when they had counted it. He
thought it strange that Cole should be
taken sick when the shortage was discov
ered and he hoped that Cole would be
able to explain everything so that he
could telephone to Mr. Leach that it was
all light. After Dimmick came out from
his" interview with Cole he told the wit
ness that he (Dimmick) did not tell Cole
the amount of the shortage, because it
was not necessary. It was all right, he
said, and the matter was only a mix-up
between the eagles and the double eagles.
Abraham Norton, who was in the assay
department, told the jury how he had
seen Dimmick experimenting with the
Jock of the vault during the time that
Dimmick was acting as cashier. On June
29, 1901, Dimmick announced a shortage of
$30,000. Mr. Leach said to him: "You
counted the money in the vault every
night and found it all right." Dimmick
replied: "I know I did, but there is $30,000
ehort to-day." Dimmick then said: "Gen
tlemen, I want you to remember that 1
when I went into the vault with Mr.
Leach last night I counted the money and
It was all there.
Dimmick Talks of Higher Tribunal.
"Gentlemen, this is a serious matter and
vre will have to answer to a higher tribu
nal than this. I suppose I'm up against
it harder than anybody else."
Charles S. Ames and F. B. Washington
gave similar testimony as to Dimmick
fumbling with the lock of the vault-
Adrian Ryan, a lock expert, swore that
It -would be possible to open a lock If a
man had a mark on the back wheel and
knew the position of the numbers on the
dial.
John F. Young, another expert, swore
that on July 13, last, he found that one of
the prongs used to keep the lock from
opening for forty-eight hours, when it
was set for over Sunday, was bent and
that the safe could be unlocked on Sun
day as well as on any other day.
Charles Waltz, another expert, testified
that the lock was a four-tumbler one, to
Â¦work with four numbers, but it could be
opened by using three of the numbers.
With one mark on the back wheel and
watching the tumblers set, a man could
easily open the vault. The bolt of the
time lock had been filed so that it could
be opened, irrespective of the time. :
Â¦ The trial will be resumed this morning.
Dimmick Said "It's Too Bad."
Dimmick Cried "Whoa!"
Dimmick Bald that he would see what
the trouble was and requested the witness
to turn the combination again very slow
ly until he got to the first number, but
before Cole reached the first "number Dim
mick called "Whoa! whoa!" and said that
the number wanted stopped at the tum
bler and he would better put that number
down where he stopped, as Cole's number
would not work. Dimmick called "Whoa!"
similarly at the other numbers, stopping
at the number 15. On the next day Cole
made a copy of the combination and
sealed it in an enveloDe and gave it to
Dimmick. He did not tell Dimmick what
the numbers were. The envelope was
broken on June 28, 1900, by Frank A.
Leach, the Mint Superintendent, while
Cole was sick in bed.
P. G. Donnelly, clerk in the cashier's
office, in the latter part of 1898 saw Dim
mick manipulating the lock. He had
taken off the plate and had a screwdriver
In. his hand. He was alone at the time.
Sometime in 1S99 the witness saw Dim-,
xnick manipulating the lock again for sev
eral days. This was during business
hours and there were eight men in the
room at the time. After the discovery of
the $30,000 shortage, Donnelly, on June 29,
1901, went with Dimmick to lunch and
Dimmick said that the money had been
stolen between the cashier's vault and the
basement; that it was in the vault on the
preceding nisrht and that Mr. Leach and
he would swear to that.
The greater part of yesterday's session
of the United States District Court, In the
trial of Walter N. Dimmick for the lar
ceny of 530,000 from the United States
Mint, was occupied in showing that Dim
mick tampered with the locks of the time
vault In which the gold was kept, and
fro aa which were taken the six sacks,
each containing 55000 In double eagles. The
first witness on this line of Investigation
was W. K. Cole, the cashier. He told
how, when he assumed the duties of his
office under Dimmick, he changed the
combination of the lock oh the safe. He
had the numbers written down on a slip
of paper, and these were not communi
cated to Dimmick. The defendant stood
behind the door of the vault and the wit
ness stood In front. IMmmlck took off the
back plate of the safe with a screw driver
end laid it on the end of the counter.
Then Cole, in accordance with the mem
orandum on the slip of paper, turned the
knob five times to the left and stopped at
the first number, then four times to the
right to another number, then three times
to the left and twice to the right and
stopped at the number 15, where Uimmick
tola him he had to stop, because the num
ber 15 was a fixture and had to be used in
that combination. The witness then tried
the combination, but found that it
wouldn't work.
