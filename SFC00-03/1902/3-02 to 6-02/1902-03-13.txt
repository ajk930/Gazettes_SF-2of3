BRILLIANT XEW YORK SENATOR WHO MADE A MOST INTEREST
ING ADDRESS TESTERDAY TN SUPPORT OF BUILDING UP THE
AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE BY SHIP SUBSIDIES.
Senator Depew then addressed the Senate In favor of the bill. Senators had
criticized the bill, he said, but none of them had submitted any plan by which
we could have a mail service' which would be equal to that of Great Britain,
Germany or France. We are, he maintained. 'Â¦ contributing millions of dollars
annually to increase still further the mail facilities and enlarge the merchant
marine of these competing countries, thus placing farther off the 'distance which
A resolution by Spooner was adopted, directing the Secretary of the Treasury
to report to the Senate the extent to which payments for carrying ocean malls
are now authorized by law, and also whether the payments are more or less in
effect than the subsidy rates provided by the subsidy bill of 1893.
At the conclusion of routine business the Senate resumed consideration of
the ship subsidy bill. McCuir.ber of North Dakota speaking In support of the
measure. He said he represented an agricultural State, interested only indirectly
In the chipping Industry, but lie favored the passage of the bill because he be
lieved the results of its operation would be beneficial not only to his constitu
ents, but to the people of the entire country. He maintained that it would be
Just as proper to remove the protective tariff duties from products produced In
this country as it would be to refuse to offer to the shipping industry the pro
tection afforded by this bill. With the subsidy provided by the bill, he thought,
In the course of fifteen years the United States would be able to compete with
the world in the ship-building industry. What the agriculturists of the West
and Northwest most desired to-day was an opening to the Pacificâ the Oriental
trade. In conclusion McCumber characterized the bill as a right step toward
reinstating our lost prestige on the seas.
IN SUPPORT OF THE SUBSIDY BILL.
Â¦ -w- x-y- -^ASHINGTON". March 12.â Again to-day the ship subsidy bill oc
\\ /h / cu P ie<1 practically the entire time of the Senate. McCumber of
Vl XII / North Dakota presented a carefully prepared argument, in
Hr Br which as a representative of an agricultural State he favored
* w the bill on the gTound of its protective features. Depew of New
Tcrk, one of the members of the Committee on Commerce, de
livered an elaborate Fpeech, in which he analyzed the arguments both for and
against the position to pay subsidies to the shipping industry. His peroration,
In which he pictured in glowing language the results of the operation of the bill,
elicited hearty appÂ»ause from the galleries.
Soon after the Senate convened Rawlins. of Utah â¢ Introduced a resolution,
Â¦which was passed, directing the Secretary of War to send to the Senate tha
reports of Inspectors Carpenter and Ma us and any other information he may
have In relation to the transports between the United States and the Philip
pines, especially regarding free transportation for Individuals.
Cullorn, chairmaji of the Committee or. Foreign Relations, reported favor-,
ebly a bill authorizing the President to extend to the Government of France an
Invitation to Join the Government and the people of the United States in the
dedication of the monument of Count de Rochambeau, to be unveiled in this city
on May 24 next?
Hoar of Massachusetts offered an amendment including in the invitation the
family of the Marquis de Lafayette. He paid a tribute to Lafayette and urged
that his amendment was peculiarly pertinent. The amendment was agreed to
and, as amended, the bill was passed.

It is further asserted that the Embassador was in close touch with Repre
sentative John J.' Lentz of Ohio. . Lentz Is a German-American. He was one of
the most picturesque Bryan figures In Congress, and his verbal attacks on Presi
dent McKlnley were such that Chairman Hanna in 1900 determined at all hazard
to retire Lentz to private life, and Lentz was defeated by the narrow margin of
about a dozen votes. It is represented to have been the dream of Lentz and the
Embassador that they might' be able to throw the German-American vote against
the J administration and put B/yan In the White House.
It is said that the Embassador was In frequent communication with promi
nent Democrats friendly to the' Bryan campaign. It is further alleged that these
conferences and consultations were held for the purpose of Influencing the Ger
man vote in : behalf of Bryan.
ALLEGED COMMUNICATION WITH DEMOCRATS.
The complaints that have been made against Dr. von Holleben deal with the
second Bryan campaign of 1900. It Is uderstood in a general way from these
charges that the Embassador, having failed to make any headway with the Me-
Klnley administration In accomplishing the desires of hl3 Government regard
ing coaling stations In the Caribbean. Sea, decided finally that these coaling sta
tions could best be obtained under Bryan. This is the understanding of tha
officials as to the ascribed motives which prompted the alleged subsequent ac
tion of the Embassador. ,

Incident to his tour with Prince Henry. There was some mystery about his
whereabouts to-day, arising from charges, but his whereabouts was learned at
the embassy to-night.
The German Embassador declared to the authorities at the State Depart
ment, when the charges were shown to him. that an attempt was being made
to blackmail him,, that he had done nothing Improper and that he was prepared
to meet any accusation that might be made against him by a reliable person.
Charges have been filed with the State Department against tha German Em
bassador and have been Investigated by the secret service. The person filing
the charge is Emll Witte, a discharged employe of the German Embassy.
. he had not been recalled his retirement from his post was only a
matter of timeâ a few concrete facts were finally evolved to-day. The Embas3a
dor has not been recalled; but stories connected with his conduct soon after ha
took his post as Embassador have come to the, attention of the administration
and became public to-day that are likely to cast a cloud over the brilliant re
ception that Prince Henry had in the -United States.

THE DE LA WARR CASE
The protest lodged by the Chinese Gov
ernment with Minister Conger at Peking
against further restrictive legislation
upon Chinese emigration to the United
States and especially the Philippine
Islands and Hawiii, is in continuation of
the efforts initiated by Minister Wu here.
The Minister, soon : after he assumed
office, -began to file protests with the
State Department, and he has since con
ducted so vigorous, an, agitation against
Chinese exclusion that, although it was
recognised that he .was simply carrying
out the directions of his government, the
Minister was made the object of vigorous
attacks by the newspapers here, some
even demanding his ejectment. It is sup
posed that Wu has acquainted his gov
ernment with the situation here and the
danger to himself of further activity In
this matter, and that the Chinese Foreign
Office accordingly has taken up the work
Itself.
MINISTER WU'S WORK.
Aiding in the escape of Chinese held in
detention is made a felony punishable by
both fine and imprisonment. A* new pro
vision applies the exclusion provision of
the bill to Chinese who enter as mer
chants, students and the like and be
come laborers.
Every person bound under this sÂ»Â«tion
to return a Chinese person who shall re
fuse or willfully neglect promptly to per
form such duty is subject to fine and Im
prisonment, and subordinate - officers,
agents and employes also are subject to
penalties.
"The duty of returning said Chinese
person is hereby imposed on the master,
owner, consignee or agent of the ver.sel,
and on the railway corporation, its gen
eral officers and agents and on the own
ers or general j officers and agentn of
other transportation lines or modes of
conveyance, collectively and severally,
bringing him to the port at which entry
is denied him or aiding him thitherto."
The paragraph concerning the return
of Chinese is changed so as to read as
follows:
"Every person bound under this section
to detain a Chinese person who shall re
fuse or willfully neglect promptly to per
form such duty shall : be deemed guilty of
a felony, and on conviction shall be pun
ished by a fine of not less than $1000 nor
more than $5000 or by Imprisonment for a
term net less than one year or by both
such fine and imprisonment."
There are, also verbal changes in the
provision concerning the detention of
Chinese who seek entry at American
ports, and the following penalty is pro
vided for failure to observe this pro
vision :
SEVERE PENALTIES.
The committee agreed to retain the pro
vision of absolute exclusion, taking the
ground that the United States wanteJ to
retain the Philippines, for the Filipinos,
and that the . latter were as mucn op
posed to the admission of Chinese as
were the Americans. Another section of
the bill about which the committee do
bated at length was that excluding
Chinese sailors from ships o" American
register. This provision was Â¦ also re
tained in the bill, but with a. proviso ro
tho effect that in case of accident, stress
of weather or serious illness the, captain
of a vessel may. ship a Chinese crcw i for
tlwj-voyagre-upon which he may liave en
tered: 'The provisions regarding, the
privilege of transit of Chinese across the
United States are changed in phraseology,
but remain practically the same in effect.
WASHINGTON, March 12.â The Senate
Committee on Immigration to-day agreed
to report the Chinese exclusion bill,
known as the Mitchell-Kahn measure.
It is substantially the same as the modi
fied bill submitted by the Pacific Coast
committee, only a few verbal corrections
having been made. A point which oc
casioned much consideration by the com
mittee was whether or not the Ch'nese
should be excluded from the Philippines,
or whether the whole proposition should
be left to the Philippine Commission.
The Hepburn bill authorizes the Presi
dent to acquire"' territory for right of
way for a canal for Costa Rica and Nica
ragua; directs the construction of a canal
of sufficient capacity to accommodate tna
largest ships from Greytown on the, At
lantic via Lake Nicaragua to Brito on
the Pacific, under the supervision of the
Secretary of War; authorizes surveys of
the harbors at the two ends of the route;
guarantees the use of the canal to vessels
of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and ap
propriates $10,000,000 for beginning the
work.
Senator Morgan, after the adjournment
of the committee, said that he probably
would report the bill to the Senate to'
morrow. "While he s would use all due d 11
gence in securing consideration of th.9
measure he had' had no conference with
the Republican members of the Senate as
to when the measure should be taken up
for consideration. He had not been
authorized to present a written report and
would not present any beyond submitting
the testimony taken during the committee
hearings. â¢' )

" "WHAT THE BILL MEANS.
Some of the members of the committee
were absent, but as their positions werrs
understood their votes were counted. The
vote for the Hepburn bill stood:
Senator Kittridge mcjved to amend by
postponing action until next Monday, but
his motion was voted down, 4 to 7.
Senator Mitchell's motion was carried
by the same vote, reversed.
When the recitation of the report had
been completed Senator Hanna suggested
that probably the Colombian Minister had
been detained by untoward circumstances
and proposed that action by the commit
tee should be delayed until an opportunity
could be haO to ascertain Colombia's posi
tion. This suggestion met with strong
protests from the friends of the Nica
ragua route, and Senator Mitchell moved
to report the Hepburn bill as it passed
the House.
Â¦ Morgan .further said that the: Govern
ments of thoee two .Voiiri'thcs had -mani
fested a disposition To ; make^all the "con-"
cessions the United States could ask to
aid. In- the construction of a. canal, an<l

MAKING ALL CONCESSIONS,
The action of the committee was taken
at a called meeting held during the after
noon and came after a brief report by
Senator Morgan, chairman of the commit
tee, detailing the. results of a conference
with- Secretary Hay' as to the status of
'diplomatic negotiations with the Central
American republics concerning the canal.
He stated that the Secretary had told him
that there are no negotiations in progress
between the United States and Colombia
concerning the. Panama route, and' the
new Minister from Colombia had not even
presented his credentials; but that, on the
other hand, the representatives of* thi3
country and t'.iose of Nicaragua ' and
Costa Rica had been in- consultation unu
had agreed upon praetlially all the points
to be covered in concession treaties, noth
ing really being loft in that connection
but to put. the agreement in writing.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 12.â The

March 12.â It is reported that General De

BOER OFFICERS KILLED.
Cabling from Brussels the correspondent
of the Standard says he has heard that
General Botha last year concluded a
treaty with the Queen of Swaziland, un
der the terms pf which the Boer forces
were enabled to enter the Queen's-ter
ritory if hard pressed by the British.
While the British anticipate further
burgher aggressiveness in the immediate
future Boers In London incline to the
contrary view. They say Methuens over
throw has put Kitchener and all his offi
cers, on their mettle and therefore the
burghers will be hard pressed for a few
weelfs, possibly meeting with some seri
ous 'reverses However, they admit if
the British commander in chief concen
trates his troops against Delarey and De
wet to the neglect of British interests in
Botha's district that general may improve
the opportunity with vigor.
Secretary of S War Brodrick is said to
have- -sharply... reminded Kitchener that
severe ' measures. Vrmist' be taken, to keep
the British commanders awake and pre
vent f them : from- swallowing stories
shrewdly circulated by the Boers to the
effect- that the burgher military organiza
tion is in a state of collapse.
Renewed rumors to the effect that
Botha's burghers are dissatisfied and
anxious to surrender were dismissed bj
the War Office as unworthy "of notice.
Apparently the fact, is beginning to dawn
on Pall Mall that . the Boers view the
spread of such reports with satisfaction,
bince they act as a sedative on the Brit
ish, both at home and in South Africa.
KITCHENER IS : -ADMONISHED.
There Is apprehension that Botha, De
larey and Dewet are all more or less like
ly to strike unforeseen blows at any mo
ment. The opinion is growing that large
reinforcements alone will enable Kitch
ener to operate effectively against the
Boers while maintaining the present enor
mous force on guard duty. It is feared
that when enough men have been moved
to the Western Transvaal 'to deal with
Delarey, Botha will renew hostilities in
the Eastern Transvaal and Dewet will
lfiuneh an unexpected attack northeast of
Blcemfentein or attempt another raid in
Cape Colon:'.

Recently 'appearing as prominent ad

"Hawaiian Japanese Ballasting Com
pany," prepared to suppiy large drays,
with two horses and two men, for. $6 a
day. -Hitherto ' this work, done by tho
contractors of the Builders' Exchange,
who employ white latapr, has been
charged tor. at $12 a day. At $6 a day,
and the cost of feed for horses and living
forfthe men, there could be very little
left for the wages of white labor. But
if the cut of one-half in prices is not
enough, the Japanese contractors '.have
announced that they will do the work for
$3 50 per day.-
Representations have been made pri
vately to members of Congress on the
subject, but no relief is expected \ from
Washington, because Japanese are at
liberty to come here, work as they please'
and for what they please, provided they
respecjt the laws of . the. country. These
ballasting contractors have sixty double
team drays at work and eighty dump,
carts.. So they are well equipped. They
are also doing much of the street curbing
work in Honolulu.
Japanese Well in Business.
Japanese laborers have not come to
Honolulu solely for the benefit of their
mental and physical conditions. Many of
them have -made money and gone into
business for themselves. Some have
stores. Others are more venturesome
and have become contractors, employing
numbers of their less fortunate country

ago. When the work upon which he was engaged was completed there was no
further need for his services and he was discharged. But Witte believed that per

3 Count Quadt, first secretary of the embassy, like his chief, is absent from the
city and will not return until to-morrow. It is, consequently, impossible to obtain
here an authorized statement in answer to the charges. But one of Herr von
Helleben's friends said that the explanation made to the State Department was
the explanation the Embassador. would make to the American people
William A. Ellerich, president of the United German-American Societies said
to-day that he was certain the Embassador had not committed any impropriety
"He has always been careful to impress upon the German-Americans his reel
ognition of the fact- that they are American citizens," said Ellerich. "I have never
heard him Intimate how he desired German-Americans to vote on public ques
tions. He knows his position too well to interfere in the slightest way in Ameri
can affairs and I do not believe there is the slightest ground for the charges made
against him." . ..'. . . -. . &.;-, . - #
"When Witte left, it is said, he communicated his views of the Embassador's
action to' the chief of the embassy. He also claims tq have letters which establish
the truth of his charges, but these letters have not yet been submitted to The
State Department. If they were at hand. then the administration could pass Upon
the propriety of Dr. von Holleben' s conduct.
The attitude of the administration is friendly to Dr. von Holleben. It is not
the intention of officials at Washington to assume for one moment that the Ger
man Embassador would so far forget hirr.seJf as to become involved, even re
motely, with Internal politics of the United* States. So far as the" administration
is concerned, therefore, the German Embassador, until full, and overwhelming
proof. shall have been forthcoming, is absolutely above suspicion. Even should it
be shown that the Embassador was actively at work promoting the campaign of
Bryan, it is doubtful if the slightest attention would be paid to it. Only on the
development of documentary proof in such a sensational way as came about when
the Dupuy de Lome letter found its way into print would the administration be
Inclined to suggest to the German Emperor the advisability of recalling his Em
bassador.
Witte, who, it is declared at the embassy, has violated the confidence of the
Embassador and who is the author of the charges against his former chief, was
generally known in Washington as the press agent of Germany. He frequently
appeared at various newspaper offices with statements friendly to Germany. His
work -was considered of importance; because through it it was hoped to allay
the enmity which existed in this country toward Germany as a result of develop
ments during the Spanish-American war. Just what the trouble was between the
Embassador and Witte, which caused the departure of the latter from the em
bassy, cannot be ascertained, but it is insisted that Dr. von Holleben was not at
fault, j. " . â¢

layed by the fact that Consul General Bucnz at New York was openly in favor of
the election of McKinley and Roosevelt. But there were 'widely spread reports
of active efforts making to manipulate the German vote.
At one stage of the campaign these reports became so disquieting that Pro
fessor Hugo Munsterberg, an eminent Ge:man professor at Harvard, wrote to
one of the candidates on the national ticket a letter in which he declared that
there was nothing; in> the:report that he or the German Embassador-had any
thing, to do with joining ;tha. Bryan movement. ' This letter is understood to have
been prompted by the reports that Professor Munsterberg was acting i-n sympa

It was a speech typical of the old Gov
ernor, who had risen from the towpath

was at hand, but his voice had all the old
fire and all the old sympathy which had
vron him the hearts of many people. It
was Governor Altgeld who pardoned the
three Chicago anarchists, and whoso
views were called anarchistic, yet his sin

; "Give us the means," said Depew, "by which American ships may be run
under the American flag and then we will build the ships in' competition with
r foreign ship yards." ..Â¦*Â¦â¢
; The New York Senator said he did not know whether Pierpont Morgan had
purchased the Leyland line of ships or. not,, but if he had it was because the lino
could be operated at a profit. He did not know anything concerning the state
. ment that Morgan had expressed no intention of bringing the vessels under the
American flag and giving them an American register. Morgan and those whom
he represented, said Depew, were acute business men. If they could afford to
fly the American flag over their vessels they would do so, but they could not bo
'â¢ expected to fly the American flag when by so doing they -would be forced to run
their ships at a loss. .,
During the past decade, Depew said, $3,SO0,O00;0O0 had been invested by Ameri
can .capitalists in manufacturing industries. Vast sums had been invested in
railroads and mines. Similar immense- sums. had not gone Into American ship
ping because figures could not be produced which would show the investor that
he could get hia money back, not to mention a fair < return upon his investment.
Depew referred to the subsidies paid by Great Britain, Germany and France,
as having contributed largely to the extension of the merchant marine of those
j nations. Â¦ ' â¢. â¢ - .
"One of -the most enlightened and progressive rulers of the Old World," he i
said, "is the present Emperor of Germany. Within the last ten years he has
brought Germany to practically a unanimous support of subsidies, by which the
German merchant marine has rapidly overtaken that of Great Britain."
Â¦No dissenting voice no?/ was ever heard among the German leaders against the
\ value of these subsidies. Germany was commercially .independent, for now
I wherever the German merchant went he was followed by the German subsidized
mails and merchant vessels. -, .
That enlightened policy Depew hoped to see this country adopt.
"If we havfe on the ocean," said he, "an adequate merchant marine it Is diffi
cult to picture the benefit to American labor which would accrue from the em
ployment of our $500,000,000 of trade balance in our own Industries and among our
own people." Â¦
A bill relating to redemption of Hawaiian silver, coins and silver certificates
and the substitution therefor of American silver coins was passed, after the sec
tion giving the territorial government of Ha-wail the benefit of the seigniorage
had been stricken out.
A bill was passed amending the revised statutes so as to allow each major
general of the army to have three aids and each brigadier general two aids, who
may be selected by them from captains or lieutenants. . t .
A joint resolution was agreed to. authorizing army and /navy officers who
served in the Chinese campaign in 1900 to wear the distinctive badges of the
organizations to which they belong on all occasions of ceremony. â¢
At 4:20 o'clock the Senate, on motion of Cockrell, went into exceutive session,
and at 4:23 adjourned. : . -
WILL COMPETE WITH FOREIGN SHIP YAEDS.
Â¦ Depew presented figures to. show that the arguments of the opponents of the
bill as. to the prosperity of American ship yards were not well founded. He de
clared that vessels aggregating: 83,000 tons had been constructed in American ship
yards for the foreign trade during the past ten years, while in Great Britain dur
ingone yearâ the last year available in statisticsâ 1,500,000 tons of ships had been
constructed. He suggested that the difference between these figures was so ex
traordinary .that., the ..opposition. Senators, ought, to post them up in their com
mittee rooms as a constant reminder of the decline of the American merchant
marine. . , . . i .-.. ..: -
Bacon of Georgia suggested that, In order to be fair and accurate, the figures
of the American construction ought to include the vessels built for the United
States for ' coastwise" trade. These figures -,Depew did not give, but he ' said \they
would not add very materially to the total. â¢ â¢
Referring incidentally to the present situation in New York, Depew said one
of the greatest handicaps to the national Democracy had. been Tammany. He
said "great hope had been builded upon the fact that a brilliant and cultivated
gentleman . recently had < been placed at tlie head of the Tammany organization.
This was Lewis Nixon, an American shipbuilder. Depew then quoted from a
paper read by. Nixon before a recent annual meeting of an association of naval
architects, In. the course of which he had said that when the United States was
in a position to build several, hundred merchant ships every .. year this country
would.be able. to compete with foreign ship yards. Until such a demand was pre
sented - to .- the United States It wouid be unable .to compete successfully with*
thip construction in foreign yards.'
"We are looking forward to that position, which we are entitled to as a world
power," said Depew, "but as a matter of fact we are crippled because we cannot
open the communications which are necessary to accomplish that commercial re
sult without the active assistance of -the subsidized ships oi our rivals in busi
ness. â¢ Â¦ . . Â¦Â¦ -- . : Â¦
"It-is a curious fact," said he, "that while our friends, the enemy, referring
to the Democratic Senators, "are so sensitive about the . expenditure of $2,000,00t>
a year to perfect our mail service to places where we hope to have commerce;
they vote for the carrying of mail on profitable mail lines in the domestic serv
ice." , . Â¦ Â¦ "S?S i :.T, ':Â¦ ' ''Â¦'Â¦.

leouf cXtarrh cures"
The Reason Why Intalers and Local
Applications Are Useless.
' For many years catarrh was considered to
be a local disease and was treated entirely by
local remedies, salves, ointments, powders,
sprays and inhalers, and nearly all of these
gave a temporary relief, but a genuine perma-
nent cure was very rare. â¢ s
It is true the most annoying symptoms, like
stoppage of the nose and throat trouble, are
purely local, but they are simply symptoms and
the real seat of disease Is far removed.
Catarrh Is a constitutional disease, a blood
disorder, complicated usually with disease of
the liver, and to suppose that local applications
_of sprays, powders, inhalers, could ever reach
"the real cause of the trouble is ridiculous.
The sensible and successful treatment Is to
remove the catarrhal poison from the system
by regulating the liver and purifying the blood
and this can only be done by an internal rem-
edy, which should consist of antiseptics and
remedies to act vigorously on the blood and
liver.
The be3t preparation of this kind which fills
all tha requirements of a safe . constitutional
treatment is Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, com-
posed of Blood Root, Red Gum and similar
wholesome antiseptics, which - are absolutely
safe to take into the stomach and which act
upon the liver, stomach and mucous mem-
brane. . j Â¦
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are large, pleasant
tasting lozenges, to be slowly dissolved ln the
mouth, thus reaching the mucous membrane
and wind-pipe and finally reaching the stom-
ach.
Dr. Edmondson, in speaking of the new
treatment for catarrh, says: "I have accom-
plished the most satisfactory results ' in all
forms of catarrh of the head, throat, bronchial
tubes, as well as catarrh of the stomach and
liver, by using nothing else but Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets. I long since threw aside sprays
and Inhaiers as being inconvenient and at the
best mere temporary make-shifts.
"Stuart's' Catarrh Tablets act immediately
upon the liver and blood and clear the wholo
system of catarrhal poison. They are pleasant
and very convenient to use. and they are not
only the latest, but I believe them to be the
best and certainly the safest treatment for any
form of catarrh."
All druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
at 50 cts. for full sized package.

larceny of $57,000. I
Thompson, when arrested, was taken to

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 12.âOver
tures have been made for compromise of
the conflict -over tariff concession to
Cuba, and there are evidences that the
two elements will come together, probably
on a proposition to have the 20 per cent
reciprocal reduction apply for one year
from next December, and covering the
sugar crop. . Â¦ - -
. It is understood that Chairman Payne
and Representative Dalzell made the
overtures toward an agreement. One of
the leading members of tne opposition
said that Payne and Dalzeil hau made
the suggestion to' him and had asked for
an answer. _ This was followed by. a hasty
canvass of oppqsition members, which
developed wide difference of views.
Representative William Smith said no
compromise would.be accepted until at a
meeting where it couid be considered de
liberately. Representative Tawney said
the limitation of time was immaterial and
that no compromise could be effected
which affected manufactured products
without similarly affecting unmanufac
tured products. . Â¦ . : .
Soon after the overtures of compromise
were made the leaders of the element op
posed to the Ways and Means Committee
plan called a conference in the rooms of
William Smith. Thirty members were
present and the discussion lasted about
two hours. The sentiment was rather
unfavorable to accepting the plan/ of 20
per cent reduction for the year from next
December, and some of those present fav
ored rejecting the plan. But it was urged
against this course that so long as over
tures for adjustment had been made in
good faith, it was only proper to meet
the committee representing the Ways and
Means, and Payne" and his associates
therefore were advised that they would
be met by -a committee from the other
side. ' . .
During the meeting the statement was
made that one of the beet' sugar advo
cates had been assured by representatives
of the Ways and Means Committee that
the plan of compromise I would not cover'
this year's sugar crop, and would anpiy
only to the crop of next year, harvested
prior to December, 1903. Some doubt ex
isted, however, as to these assurances,
and it was considered quite vital to learn
with definiteness whether the 20 per cent
reduction would apply to two crops or to
one.
It was stated afterward by Ways and
Means Committee members that the com
promise plan ,would affect two cropsâ that
of this year and nextâ allowing 20 per
cent off on each. There was no purpose,
it was stated, to limit the reduction to a
single crop. This matter probably will be
left to the arbitrating committee, with the
indications that the beet sugar conferees
will insist on limiting the reduction to
one crop, that of next year, and with that
limitation will be inclined to accept' the
plan of compromise. â¢
A full conference of the opposition to
Cuban concessions will be held to-morrow
prior to meeting representatives of the
Ways and Means Committee.
TRAINS WILL HAVE
QUICK TELEPHONE SERVICE
Railroad Companies Arrange to Pro-
vide a NoveJ Convenience for
Their Patrons. -
CHICAGO, March 12.â In connection
with the overland limited trains, the man
agements of the Chicago and Northwest
ern, Union Pacific and Southern -Pacific
railroads have decided to provide a quick
service telephone system for the use of
patrons of trains arriving at stations in
Chicago, Omaha and San Francisco. This
innovation, the first of its kind in the
world, will be started about April 1, when
the equipment will be ready for service.
Many patrons of the overland limited are
business men, to whom such telephone
service. will prove valuable.
There will be a special wire connection
between trains and stations and rapid
connection will permit the use of a tele
phone to within thirty seconds of the
leaving time for the train. It has been
decided to make up the overland limited
trains at least forty-five minutes before
the scheduled leaving time at both 'ends
of the transcontinental ' route. The tele
phone will be in the rear of the observa
tion car, which will be nearest to the sta
tion entrance, and the receiver will rest
on a mahogany desk. There will be â¢ a
telephone boy fir charge.
The meetings of the Central Labor
Union and the Building Trades Council
to-morrow night are awaited with great
interest. It is well known that the -Cen
tral Labor Union is not pleased with the
manner in which the strike has been con
ducted, especially with the fact that it
was rot consulted before the strike was
ordered. There is aÂ» very strong feeling
against ordering a sympathetic strike on
this account, but it is the general belief
that, although such action will be bit
terly fought, the meeting will indorse the
strike to the extent of ordering, out' the
ninety bodies affiliated in Its membership.
It is also believed that the Building
Trades Council will take similar action
as a matter of principle,
The effect of the strike is being left
severely in near-by manufacturing towns.
At Lynn shoe factories employing in the
segregate 3000 hands have been forced to
shut down because of the failure, to re
ceive consignments of leather, and some
other establishments are running on half
time. At Somerville a pork packing con
cern which ordinarily employs 1200 hands
has laid off about half of the men and
may be obliged to suspend operations en
tirely.
The strike of coal teamsters was one of
the most aggravating features of the day
and its effect was quickly felt at hotels,
restaurants and places having accommo
dation for only a limited supply of coal.
The brewery employes will, it is said, be
locked out by Priday if the strike con
tinues, as the supply of coal on hand at
the various breweries will give out by
that time and work will have to be sus
rÂ»ended.
Freight business at the various ; rail
roads, wharves and docks has been al
most at a etandstill to-day, and the mov
ing of accumulated merchandise is be
coming a serious matter to merchants.
The railroad company against which tho
strike is chiefly directed, the New York,
New Haven and Hartford, shows no in
clination to ask for interference by the
National Civic Federation and reiterate3
what it has said from the firstâ that its
duties as 'a common carrier are defined,
by the law and that it is compelled to
handle all freight delivered to It, whether
by union or non-union teams, and that it
has no option in the matter. This posi
tion, if adhered to by the company, may
result in the refusal of the federation to
interfere in the quarrel, as it desires â¢ a
request from both sides before taking up
the matter. . . :
The answer from Senator Hanna does
not leave a further opening for working
for an immediate settlement.
"Until the railroad officials consent to
having the differences considered, by the
arbitration board there ' is nothing more
that we can do. They are obdurate,
therefore our hands are tied. The Gov
ernor and myself have done all in our
power to render assistance."
During the day Governor Crane had a
long talk with the committee of the Al
liea Transportation Council, having the
strike in charge, but at its conclusion
he announced that he could see no way at
present of solving: the problem.- Later he
sent for Mayor Collins and the two ex
ecutives were in conference for some
time. A little later the Mayor made a
statement that he had no power to act.
He said further:
This conference, which is due in a large
measure to the influence of Governor
Crane, was arranged late this evening, at
a meeting of representatives of the Bos
ton Chamber of Commerce, the Boston
Associated Board of Trade and the Bos
ton Merchants' Association with the
State Board of Arbitration. Everybody
present realized the seriousness of the
situation, and after an interchange of
opinions it was decided that the best way
of getting at public opinion would be to
call a conference of the business men of
the city.
BOSTON, M^rch 12.â With twenty thou
sand men idle, their ranks likely to be
greatly swelled by sympathetic votes of
the Building Trades Council and the Bos
ton Central Labor Union, which will meet
to-morrow night, and the entire city be
ginning to suffer from the effects of con
gested traffic, the only ray of light visi
ble to-night in the strike situation is tho
hope that a. conference of business Inter
ests which has been arranged for to-mor
row may lead to a settlement. |

PAINE'S
Celery Compound
Earnest and Candid Statements
Made by a California Lady.
The absolute need of an honest and gen-
uine invigorator and health giver In thÂ«
spring season Is deeply Impressed on thÂ»
mind of every thinking : and : intelligent
man and woman. .
. The happy cure of Mrs.. J. E. WUcox of
"Winters, Cal., through the use of Palne's
Celery Compound, created. widespread as-
. tonlshment and joy. amongst- her friends
and neighbors, who were exceedingly anx-
ious regarding her condition. ;
The best medical treatment failed even
to give Mrs.. Wilcox a few days of relief
from her sufferings of mind and body. At
last, Palne's Celery Compound saved her
from a terrible end and planted her feet
firmly on the rock of health.
Head Mrs. -Wllcox's letter of testimony,
dear reader, and if you remain obdurats
and unbelieving after such ah earnest and
convincing confession of cure, nothing but
a direct act of Providence can snatch you
from the dangers and perils of your posi-
tion. Mrs. Wilcox says:
"I feel it my duty to tell you Â¦ what
Paine's cfelery Compound did for me.
Some years ago my head troubled me so
that it seemed I should be crazy. *t was
caused by overstudy. I asked thw advice
of two doctors who gave me medicine to
no effect, and I did not know what I
would do. I did not want to see any one,
everything seemed so strange. I had a
tired, lagging feeling, my bowels were out
of order, my kidneys troubled me, and I
felt badly, but before I had taken half of
one bottle of Paine's Celery Compound I
felt like a new person. Four bottles cured
me and I would recommend it \o all who
feel the way I did. I can't praise it half
enough, for I know it saved my life and
kept me from imprisonment in an insana
asylum, which Is as bad as death."

The great four-mile Thornton stake will
be decided on Saturday. This event usu
ally evokes more real -interest and enthu
siasm than any other stake run during
the season. Unless a dark horse looms up,
the issue looks to lie between Ldzzella
and Siddons. The former mare shines at
her best on a lightning fast track, while
if the going should be heavy, Siddons ap
pears to have the prize at his mercy.

THE d-AXiI-i'S K.-A.OI3STC3- FORM CHART
Seemingly out of it at one stage, El
Mido, piloted by Ransch and a 12 to 5
choice, turned up a clever winner of the
mile and fifty yard selling affair. Loyal
S and Grand Sachem cut out the running,
but both backed up badly the last eighth.
El Mido passed between the pair, scor
ing almost easily from the former. Lode
star cut no figure in the race.
Quiz II, a 7 to 10 favorite, could finish
no closer up than third In the closing six
furlong spin, decided under selling condi
tions. Killdoe led almost to the wire,
when Evea.G, with Ransch in the sad
de. closed strong on the outside, down
ing the Schreiber entry a neck.
Trainer Fred Patterson of the' Burns &
Waterhouse stable had high hopes of see
ing Bangor display his old form in the
mile and a quarter run. This fact was
enough to cause theÂ«books to Install the
notorious sulker an even money chance.
Later on, when a plunge was made on
Picador, sending that horse to the post a
mild 2 to 1 favorite, 11 to 5 could be had
about Bangor. Picador was In front most
of. the way and Bangor ran or sulked just
as the notion hit him. When Ransch
struck him with the whip he ran out the
last furlong, almost finishing in the
Judges' stand, yand then Picador under
Troxler's clever riding, only won by a
neck. With better Yacing luck Morinel,
which ran third, could have been first.
Only four started in the. two-year-old
scramble at half a mile, with Walter Jen
nings' strapping colt, Arabo, ruling a
alight favorite over George West. "Lon^
fihot" Conley had the mount on the lat
ter filly and, breaking from the outside,
cut across, seizing the rail position.
Georgle then.went on and, though pressed
some near Hhe wire, won comfortably
ffom the favorite by a couple of lengths.
Hudson led out Escarola for third place.
Roscoe Troxler. astride Phil Archibald,
earned a nose decision over RanBch on
Golden Light at the close of the seven
furlong event following. Nllgar, the fa
vorite, piloted by J. Woods, cut out the
pace until well into the stretch, where he
flattened out. Golden LJght looked a win
ner, but overconfldence on the part of
Ransch cost him the race. Archibald
cloned at odds of 18 to C. i
?-i|^a HtJ lnflde or rail poxltluu was ihe
I path that led to wealth again at

circumstances many "done brown" Rood

the talent unloaded lavishly failed to
make very Hose connection* at the wire,
due In every Instance to the fact that
they did not have early speed or were un
fortunate nt the stftrt. Tho track la rap
idly drying out, and these conditions will
be materially changed this nfternoon.
While the fluids \yerÂ«Â« not ubove medi
ocrity, the attendance wuÂ» larger than
usual.
Ned Dennis ngaln held the place of
honor In the betting, KolnK to the post a
<6 to 5 choice for the opening; nlx-furlong
siTlnt. Ransch could not Bet the rail po-
Hltion and did not get closer up than fifth
at any stage of the game. Blrkenrulh on

THE management of the Woodward
Amusement Company, whicn
opened a winter circus in Wood
ward's Pavilion u few weeks
ago, changed hands yesterday
liternoon with u suddenness that was al
ogcthf-r startling- When the performers
md a small army of supernumeraries
went to the pavilion to collect their sal
urles they were confronted with an
empty . treusury. "All day long the acro
bats, contortionists. . bareback j riders,
clowns and supes -waited aiid watched,
but their vigil was In vain, for the ghost
refused to walk.
Ah night approached the news waK
Perry . until he became hypnotized by
the glare of the ring -light* wus never
known to part with a dollar unless it was
absolutely necessary. | His friends consid
ered him close, but after the attack of.
circus mania he parted with $4000. Even
the advice and stern admonition of his at
torney failed Â¦" to restrain him. No ex
penditure was too great to secure attrac
tions for the circus. When he was finally
led to see that the venture was not suc
ceeding he shed tears at the very thought
that the show. With its bright lights and
score of bespangled acrobats, would have
to close Its doors. In order that the show
might not want a. numerous audience
passes were issued without end. AH the
managers, stockholders anfl performers
were given passes, which they distributed
Iri blocks of. 100. On Saturday night, when
there were about 1000 people in the house
only $40 was taken in at the box office '
Even Perry's patience and bank i ac
count could not stand the expenditure
Which was necessary for the maintenance
of a clrcusunder such conditions, so yes
terday he withdrew. â¢â¢ The circus is well
worth attending. It contains, numerous
attractive featur.es and under a different
management may be made to pay.
The expense bill for the first week
amounted to $1500, while but $400 was
taken in at the door. I Perry was told that
as soon as .good. .weather came people by
the thousands .would flock to the ehow,
and that It would be but a matter of a
few weeks, until he would become a
Croesus. I ;
Perry Tires of Circus Life.
The new amusement company began
with a flourish. None but the very best
lit the, ringed arena wore good enough
to take part in Its performances. The
Dunbar family wits engaged at a salary
of $.500 a week; Bernard with his trick
horpes was down on the hooka for $250,
while Professor Rawson and his trained
ponies drew $200* On the programme each
night there were twenty-two numbers,
and it is safe to Bay that no performer
received less than $50 a week for his
services. Almost the entire expense was
shouldered by Perry without a murmur.
Although thu Woodward Amusement
Company nun had but a short cureer, It
hue succeeded in pulntlng a lurid Htivak.
The compuny was organized with a
cupltftllzatlon of $75,000. J. E. Sllnkey
was tho prime mover and W. A. Peel wan
the president. The other members of the
company were W. A. Kendall, a iÂ«hoe
niakor; G. Ueahrut, proprietor of the True
Ulue saloon, and J. B. Ferry, a wealthy
contractor. .

On Friday night the board of governors
of the Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union will take action, on the
cases of several boxers who are charged
with having accepted money Instead of
the prizes which amateurs are allowed to
accept. If the matter Is pressed It is ex
pected to place some of the clubs in an
.â¢iwkward predicament. They may be
forced to take out a license and promote
enly professional bouts.
The officers of the Academic Athletic
League are preparing for the fourth an
nual swimming tournament, open to
members of the league. Secretary Her
bert Hauser has already sent out the en

of four events. These will be at 100
yards, 220, 440 and half-mile. Teams are
limited to tlve men each. No more than
two men from one school can enter each
event. The tournament, will probably be
held on April 11. The directors of the
Olympic Club have placed the swimming
tank at the disposal of the league officers.

Improvement party was held In Geneva
Hall for the purpose of nominating candi
dates for Town Trustee*. The committee
of fifteen appointed at c previous meetine
reported unanimously in favor oÂ£ W. Q.
Morrow and J. F. Jones.
Morrow spoke briefly, saying that he
was opposed to the poolrooms and would
do everything possible to keep them out;
that he conscientiously believed them to
be a menace to the town, as much to thÂ»
merchants as to the roside^ts. He point
ed out that Sausalito was the only com
munity In the State which countenanced
poolrooms, and asserted tnat .if they
could be driven away, real estate values
would bo made more stable, and more
men would be employed In tho building

of desirable residents.. UÂ» the end th Â»Â« ">*
revenue of the town may be enhanced without
an increase of taxation and without a. resort^ to
questionable sources of revenue, and that tnÂ»
Increase of permanent population may promote

The liability to disease is greatly i

Introduced to tho public by Nat Goodwin,
who vras In the way of wanting some
thing serious just about the time Mr.
Fitch completed "Nathan Hale," and he
played it for some time with as much suc
cess as could be expected from Mr. Good
win In that kind of role. But his interest
in the serious drama soon lapsed, and the
whole production passed into the hands
of Howard Kyle, who brings it to the
California thisweek. Mr. Kyle's company
is Eaid to be unusually capable, and Mr.
Kyle's- assumption of the leading role
Feems to be more' than adequate by tnÂ»
favorable report that precedes him. Cer
tainly in the story of the gallant young
patriot the playwright had a splendid
'subject, and he is said to have made much
of it. History has been adhered to in th<?
larger lines of the play, while some
plausibly introduced comedyâ the fir^t two
acts consisting: largely of comedy â serves
to relieve the gloom of the story. Among
the talented members of Mr. Kyle's com
pany is Kathryn de Barry, who plays the
role of Mistress Knowlton.

KEPUBLICAIJS' GAINING
ON LABOR CANDIDATES
Whether this section is mandatory upon
the Supervisors to contirm any appoint
ment the Justices might make is a ques
tion on which attorneys are inclined to
wage dispute. The assumption of some
Is that tne term "shall" means' "must,"
in which case the issue is plain. Others
affirm that the Supervisors form a legis
lative as well as ministerial body, aivl
that they have a legal right to exercisa
cMscretion in the matter of confirmation.
If this contention be admitted as true,
ilio possibility of securing a unanimous
vote on confirmation of . appointments
would be practically an impossibility. The
ceneral opinion is that the section quoted
is in no sense mandatory upon the Super
\Uors- to concur in the selection, to ' be
made by, the Justices.
Section 86 â Tho Supervisors of such city and
county shall appoint a Justices' Clerk on, the
written nomination and recommendation of
said Justices or a majority of them, who shall
hold oincc for two years and until Ids suc
cessor is In like manner appointed and qual
ified. â¢ * * -
Supervisor Wynn has called a. meeting
of the special committee of the Board of
Supervisors appointed, to confer with the
Justices of the Peace -relative to the ap
pointment of a ' clerk to the Justices'
Court. 'The meeting will be held this aft
ernoon at 5 o'clock In the office of Mayor
Schmltz, end tho Justice*, are expected
to be present.
Every attempt thus far made to un
ravel the present tangle has only led to
the making of more knots. About fifty
cundldatci are seeking tho position, but
the fight has really simmered down to
five, theuo being in the order of prefer
ence us follows; Frank Grimes, formerly
clerk of Department 1 of the Buperioi*
Court; George McComb, .formerly a dep
uty undor Cierks Williams and Windrow;
Kivhard Welsh, State Henator and dep
uty county clerk; Frank Haynes, an at
torney, und Andrew Woods, an attache- of
ti local lav/ paper. Windrow", Wiliiama
and Fredrick, tne Mayor's appointee, arÂ«
nlao hopeful that the lightning may utrlka
f:i their direction;
None of the Justices will admit that
they have any choice. They expect to get
together and deciue upon a candidate ami
liebent his name to the Supervisors' com
mittee. But some of them do not like to
meet In the othce of the Mayor because
tlic-y .feel that he usurped some of their
authority. When they get t\ together a
rian of action will be tormulated, but
there will ue many moves on the political
checker- board before . this result is ac
complished. As the case stands at pres
ent Grimes has two Justices in his favor,
and the third, in the person of Justice
Joachimson, is being sought. Neither
Daniels, Dunn nor L.ong will admit for
publication that he favors Grimes.
Section 8t> of tne Code of Civil Procedure,
which it has been held governs the case,
is in part as follows:
If an Agreement Is Reached
Appointment Will Soon
Be Made.
Supervisors Will Talk
Over Matt er Wi bh
the Justices.

ttresgth to eezual organ*. Depot, 223 Market,ONE of the encouraging features of. Southern
life just now is the fight. that is being made
against the unrestricted employment of chil
dren in the factories that are springing up so rap
idly in the cotton States. A very large number of
the factories are owned by Northern capital and are
under the control of Northern managers, so that. an
appeal has been made by Southern reformers to
Northern sentiment for assistance in putting an end
to the evil. It is rightly urged that since the owneW
of many of the mills are out of reach of public
opinion in the South they ought to be made to feel it
in their Northern homes. .. j , Â¦Â¦ . .
) Public sentiment, however, whether North or
South, is not going to have much effect unless.it be
directed to the enactment of legislation forbidding
child labor. That much has been proven by the ex
perience of every country in dealing with the fac
tory, system of labor. It was so in old England and
in New England; in the East and in the West. The
South must profit by the example of the older man
ufacturing communities and enact laws to put a stop
to a practice whose pernicious effects can hardly be
overrated. ... (
Among the forces leading the contest for the
emancipation of children from the .curse of prema
ture toil the labor organizations of the country v have
naturally taken an important 'part. A report re
cently published by an agent of the Federation of
Labor upon conditions in the Southern mills says:
"Little ones ofvsix or even younger begin their
twelve hours' work a day in the mill, and thereT.is
scarcely a factory' out of the 663 at the beginning of
1901 without a batch of little ones under twelve.
When the mills are run at night,- brilliantly lit with
electricity, the little ones are still at work. The
illiterate negro sends his child to school,, the illiter
ate white man sends his into the mill. In Augusta,
Ga., there, are 567 children under, twelve working in
eight mills. Of 'these only 120 can read or write,
and they entered after their tenth birthdays and had
learned what they knew before that. In Alabama^
where the industry is -comparatively new, .there are
from 1000 to 1200 children under twelve in the mills,
SOUTHERN CHILD LABOR.
It is stated that a magazine has offered Miss Stone
$35*000 for a series of six articles, and if so the profits
of the affair will be $100,000 for the bandits, $35,000
and lecture bureau' fees for the abducted missionary,
with probably $50,000 for the fellows who helped to
look for, her. It is a business that pays everybody
concerned, and the general public gets the benefit

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
The State Board of Railroad Commis
sioners filed in the United States Circuit
Court yesterday their answer to the three
complaints filed by the railroad companies
in the oil rate cases. One suit is by the
Southern California Railroad Company,
another by the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad
Company, and the third by thÂ© Atchlson.
Topeka and Santa Fe Company. There
are three answers,, one to each, suit, buc
as the suits are similar the answers are
likewise.
The Commissioners deny that the rail
roads of the complainants connect at
Barstow, and allege that the said Hne3 of
railroad have been and axe owned, oper
ated and controlled by the Atchlson, To
peka and Santa Fe, and that the same
have been operated in connection with the
entire system of railroads referred to In
the complaints as the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe system of roads, and no
one of them was, during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1901, operated as a separ
ate Brie, nor -were the earnings or oper
ating expenses in any manner separately
kept or ascertained, but that thÂ© sama.
were maintained and operated by thcM
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe as a part
of its system. They allege further that
the figures given as the net and gross
earnings and- the operating expenses of
the separate roads are simply estimates
and arbitrary statements, and that there
are no means of estimating exactly or ap
proximately the earnings or expenses of.
said lines of railroad. | It Is averred also
that the roads paid a very large profit,
both as an entire system and upon that
part which Is operated wholly vithln the
State of California. N
Reduced Bates Are Reasonable! .
The Commissioners further deny tiiat
they gave th/eir consent or approval or
ratification to the rates fixed by the com
panies for the transporation of petroleum
over the lines of the complainants in
Southern California or elsewhere. They
also deny that thÂ© rates so fixed are rea
sonable, and deny that the company or
its roads will suffer any injury whatever
by the enforcement of the reduced rates
proposed by the Commissioners.
. The Commissioners allege that their
schedule of rates was adopted after a
careful and thorough investigation of all
the circumstances pertaining ' to or sur
rounding the said rates. Denial Is made
of the allegation of the company that jL
per cent must be paid for the uss Â¦%*
money for railroad purposes and it is
alleged that money for that purpose may
be obtained for 4 per cent. Then, usinff
plainer language, the Commissioners aver
that the claim of ownership separately of
Uie different lines is a sham, and that
the said lines are owned and operated
exclusively by the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe.
Business "Will Continue to Increase.
The allegation is further made that
the bonded Indebtedness of the complain
ant Is in excess of the assessed valuation
of the property. With reference* to the
statement that | nine-tenths of the busi
ness between San Francisco and Bakers
field is done by the Southern Pacific
Company the Commissioners say that tho
Atchlson, Topeka and Santa Fe is young
yet. and that its business will continue to
increase. The answer alleges further that
the earnings of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the Atchlson. Topeka and Santa
Fe between Bakersfleld and San Fran
cisco for the carriage of oil alone exceed
: $1,500,000 per annum, not Including ship
ments south of Tehachapl, and that theso
earnings will steadily increase. In con
clusion the Commissioners ask that all
the actions be consolidated into one and
tried together. . . ,
Because-)of neglect. It is said, the tree*
, of Boston Common are in a woeful state
of degeneracy." There are ninety-four

Supervisor Connor submitted an amend
ed minority report, based on City,.Engi
neer Grunsky's report of March 10. This
amended report adds $177,166 to the pres
ent valuation of $23,914,454, making a total
of $24,091,620, and $SS58 30 to the interest
allowed, making $1,204,581 03. The report
explains that this increased amount does
not in any way change the ordinance pre
sented by the minority of the Water Com
mittee, as the company will receive suffi
cient revenue to meet it from increased
meter rates for public buildings.
As a result of much questioning Engi
neer Schussler made certain definite prop
ositions as to expenditures for improving
the distributing system which the com
pany would make . if the Supervisors
would fix rates as provided either in the
majority report or in the Mayor's recom
mendations. This, he contended, was done
on his own authority and against the
judgment of the directors, who stood out
for a $5 fire hydrant rate.
Dependent on . Bates.
! If the fire hydrant rate were fixed at $5
and other rates left unchanged Schussler
agreed that within two years the com
pany-would expend the $465,000 necessary
to put in larger mains and increase the
fire pressure in accordance with the rec
ommendations of Fire Chief Sullivan. If
the hydrant rate of the majority report,
$2>E0, be adopted Schussler said he would
pledge the company to expend $127,003
during the year for the Improvements
which Chief Sullivan had indicated a*3
most urgent. After repeated questions by
Supervisors Braunhart. and Brandenstein
Schussler agreed to such improvements
even should a $2 fire hydrant rate be es
tablished. When the $1 75 hydrant'rate of
the minority report was suggested
Schussler objected and said if it were
adopted, the company would expend only
the items ( of $10,000 for mains in the Sun
set District and $16,000 for increasing the
pressure in the Market-street mains*
From figures presented by. Schussjer it
appears that the company proposes to ex
pend between 5700,000 and $800,000 during
the next flscaJ year on the present reser
voir sites and dams. "Expenditure for im
proving the distributing system would de
pend, both Engineer Schussler and Attor
ney Kellogg explained, on the board's
adopting a fair ordinance,. one that would
raise, the market value of th,eir stock to
par so that sufflcierit.of itimight be sold
without sacrifice to give the better service
desired."
_ Hates and the Stock Market.
"The trouble is,*';Kellogg said, "you de
cide that. 5; per cent is a fair income on
our/ investment and then you. pass an or
dinance that gives us but 3?4' or/4 and a
fraction per cent.
"If you'll squeeze the water out of your
stock," Supervisor - Connor said, with
some heat, ."you'll get 5 per. cent on your
investment^ under the ordinances T pro
posed." ...Â¦Â¦' . _j,'
Kellogg tried tp, show how the, Super
visors'; lack of fairness, as he termed itl
hurt the market' for their stock and so
prevented- needed ' improvements , because
the company could not afford to dispose
of more stock so much below par. '

Supervisor Braunhart and Engineer
Schussler 'of the Spring Valley Water
Company occupied the center of the stage
during the afternoon's inquiry, with At
torney M. B. Kellogg occasionally coming
to the support of the engineer and Super
visors BrandensÂ£ein and D'Ancona ask
ing pertinent questions of the corpora
tion's representatives.
The Supervisors continued the water
rates investigation yesterday in commit
tee of the whole and ended with closing
the inquiry and reporting back to the
board all the reports and evidence ad
duced. The board will meet next Mon
day at 1 o'clock to consider the reports
and fix rates for the next fiscal 'year.
It is difficult to understand how even such a fussy
man as Senator Hoar could have been so worked up
by a mere call for a resolution to make such a state
ment. The proposed amendment is not going to
affect any principle of the constitution at all. It is
not going to deprive the States, great or small, of
their equality of representation in the Senate. It is
not going to violate any pledge of the nation. . It
has no other intent and will have no other effect than
that of changing the method by which United States
Senators are elected. Each State will retain the
equal representati6n it now has, and every pledge
of the constitution to the States will be maintained
inviolate. It, is, jn feet, a question of- methods
merely, and not an issue of principle in any respect
whatever.
Even the plea that the present method of election
renders the Senate, like the Supreme Court, free
from the influence of popular movements and popu
lar excitements is not valid. Popular excitements,
if they .ire to be dreaded, must be guarded against
by some other means than that of requiring Sena
tors to be elected by legislators instead of the people,
for legislators are just as much subject to excite
ments as the people themselves. Legislative election
lias not prevented cranks of various kinds from en
tering the United States Senate, and the propor
tion of men of tkat sort in the Senate has not been
less than the proportion in the House.
The "popular excitement" argument, however, is
hardly better than a scarecrow. Senators hold for
six years: only one-third of their number are
elected in any one year. They come from widely
separated States. Such a body of legislators is not
likely to become too susceptible to popular in
fluences. The danger lies in the opposite direction.
Experience has shown that the election of Senators
by the present method leads to bribery, corruption,
.the subordination of State interests to Senatorial
contests, and to the election to the Senate of men
utterly unfit for the position! The demand for a
change arises from that experience, and sooner or
later is bound to be heeded.
Senator Hoar, speaking for the opposition, de
clared at once that he would not permit the call for
the resolution to pass without objection. He went
on to say: "This is z proposition to change a prin
ciple upon which the constitution is founded, and it
is a matter of historical fact that without the incor
poration of this principle the constitution never
would have been agreed to. The solemn pledge was
given to the States, small and great, that the equal
ity of the States never would be destroyed without
the consent of every one of them. The adoption of
the resolution could not be accomplished without a
breach of the national pledge." He then declared
the Supreme Court and the United States Senate to
be the two great bodies of the Government which
are free from the influence of popular movements
and popular excitements, and added: "I will do my
duty here as a member of the Committee on Elec
tions, but will not be hurried, and the Senate shall
not be hurried if I can help it."
PRESSURE of public sentiment has at last
forced the Senators to take notice of the reso
lution adopted by the House in favor of a con
stitutional amendment providing for the election of
United States Senators by direct vote of the people.
The Committee on Privileges and Elections has
been asked when it would report the resolution, and
the chairman of the committee, Senator Burrows,
has declared it will be submitted to the Senate in
time for action to be taken at this session. It is not
likely that it will be adopted when submitted, but
the very fact that it will be brought up for full dis
cussion is something. The resolution is not to be put
aside as of no moment. It is to have a hearing, and
those who oppose it must give their reasons for it.
: SENATORS AND THE PEOPLE.
Such men are not likely to control the vote in the
House unless they get all the Democrats to vote
with them. Should that happen it will be the duty
of the people in the coming election to take note of
those .who voted with the free-traders and retire!
them from Congress. In the present emergency
American industry cannot afford to trust to half-way
Republicans.- We must put none but stanch pro
tectionists on guard.
.Â«. Our invasion of Europe is becoming a matter for
the deepest concern, and if- some of our ambitious
capitalists are not more careful we will have new
trouble on our, hands. J. Pierpont Morgan wants
to send the yacht Columbia across the pond with the
boast that it can" beat the best our Continental friends
can supply. ES
Â¦ . Â¦ * '
If the British boast that nothing but guerrilla, war
fare is now in, progress in South Africa' be' true we
can most heartily congratulate the British that they
are not compelled, to face anything more serious
They ;might have* cause. to ask the nations to try the
Boers for wanton murder.
.Another fast train has been; wrecked," this; time in'
Iowa, ; because of, a, misunderstanding of signals. If
State, Legislature^ were to; make -..such v misunder
standings punishable by. death, newspapers would
lose the recital of; railroad horrors. *
That is the; situation, but now conies a strong
lobby urging the sacrifice of American sugar inter
ests for the sake, it is said, of "helping Cuba." Un
der the fair-sounding name of "reciprocity" the
scheme is being put forward as a part of the general
policies of the Republican party. Its supporters,
however, come mainly from the ranks of free-traders,
or from Republicans who are willing to sacrifice the
interests of some Americans for the advantage of
others, or from those who, are dominated by senti
ment, and. believe we really owe Cuba, a debt that
can, be paid only by assuring her a continual pros
perity.
. In a recent report upon the subject the Committee
on National Affairs of "the Republican Club of New
York said: "In view of the fact that we are pay
ing $100,000,000 annually for foreign sugar, and en
couraged by the repeated pledges of \ie Republi
can party in its national platforms of fidelity to the
principle of protection, in addition to the vast sugar
interest of Louisiana, American citizens have in
vested $27,000,000 in the beet sugar industry in the
United States, and so rapid has been its development
since its establishment about a dozen years ago that
facts sustain the prediction that within ten yÂ§ars of
continued protection this domestic product will en
tirely; meet the. home consumption, the sum of an
otlier $100,000,000 be spent in our market for
the enrichment of our own people, and another great
industry, in; addition to that of tm plate, steel rails
and many others, be credited to the Republican prin
ciple of protection."
The resolutions submitted ,to the conference ex
press true Republicanism. They declare: "First,
that we reaffirm our adherence to ' the Republican
national platform of. 1896, insuring adequate protec
tion to the cane and -beet sugar industries of the
United States r 'and .to the policy of reciprocity as
declared in our platform of 1900. Second, that, we
have maintained and will continue to faithfully dis
charge the obligation , to Cuba assured by virtue of
the treaty of Paris and. the Platt amendment, and
that we favor such commercial 1 agreements with her
as her. government,, when established, may be/ willing
to make and which will be in harmony with our na
tional policy of protection, and reciprocity. Third,
that no further action be taken respecting the propo
sition to reduce the tariff on Cuban products com
ing into this country."
7* It is difficult to see how any stanch and genuine
Republican can consistently oppose such resolutions.
In fact, the leading speaker in favor of reciprocity at
the conference was^compelled fo base his argument
upon the assertion, "as reported) that "Cuba is now
and has been ever since the treaty of Paris under
the sovereignty of the United States; that her terri
tory is a part of the territory of the United States,
and that her people have been permitted to erect a
government, but not a sovereignty, and consequently
they have a right to special trade privileges with this
country." An argument based upon such assump
tions hardly needs - refutation. It is worth noting,
however, 'as an evidence of the drift of the Cuban
sugar schemers to bring about annexation of the
island.
DISPATCHES from Washington concerning
the conference of Republicans of the House
on the Cuban reciprocity question show that
while no decisive vote on the issue was taken there is
every reason to believe the opponents of reciprocity
are assured of ultimate .victory. It is stated they
were eager for a i vote Ion. the 'question, while the ad
vocates of the scheme sought delay. At the request
of the Speaker delay was granted, but it is stated
that many who voted for postponement did so
solely out of deference to the Speaker's appeal.

According to a calculation made by. the Naval Bu
reau of Ordnance, Dewey's fleet burned seventy-five
tons of powder and hurled sixty-seven tons of pro
jectiles at a total cost of $50,000" during the" battle of
Manila, while in the Santiago" fight the consumption
of powder by our fleet was fifty tons and the weight
of projectiles 114 tons,, while .the cost was $85,000.
It will be seen that the 'cost was big in each case, but
considering what we got for'it'there is no occasion
for kicking. ' Â¦â¢
It is a case of "hands all round." The time has
come for San Francisco to demonstrate her leader
ship in the Statef for her merchants, bankers and
manufacturers to show their willingness to help in
the upbuilding of the interior. The movement has
been started. Let every man of progressive ideas
and energies aid in promoting it.
Taking all things into consideration the prospect
for starting a swift development of the northern
counties of the State is brighter than it has been for
years. The counties themselves^are moving with a
new activity, with resolution and in harmony with
one another. San Francisco adds her forces to a
movement already under way. The approaching ex
position at St. Louis gives a stimulus to immediate
exertion by promising immediate benefits. No time
is to be wasted in looking about to see what shall be
done. Enthusiasm perceives its work directly "before
it. We must make at St. Louis an exposition that
will show how much we have advanced since the
days of the grand exhibit at Chicago. It must be a
State exhibit and every section of the State must be
represented. Those sections that need help must
have help, and those counties which are doing most
for themselves should have the cordial co-operation
of the metrooolis.
The speeches at the meeting of the Chamber of
Commerce were equally pointed and harmonious.
A cordial approval was given to the plan of co
operating with the interior counties, and President
Newhall was authorized to act as a representative of
the chamber and to call a meeting of the presidents
of other commercial bodies in the city for the pur
pose of effecting a joint organization through which
all of them can work together in the enterprise.
While no official action on the matter Has as yet been
taken by the other commercial and industrial organi
zations, it is not to be doubted that all will join in.
The movement, in fact, is too important and the cir
cumstances of the timeÂ«are too propitious for a suc
cess which will be of benefit to the city and to the
State for any body of progressive citizens to hold
aloof from it. ,_^
"It was Josh Billings, I think, who advised that the
best time to set a hen is the time when the hen
wishes to set, and that is good' philosophy along all
other lines of life. The" country is wide awake now
and wishes to promote its own interests. There is
no better excuse than that furnishes for us to' jump
right in and, help." '
That is the issue in a nutshell. The only thing to
be added to it is the statement that the time to give
help to Northern California is right now. Mr.
Mills brought out that point very clearly in saying:
It is just as well to repeat over and over again, in
order that it may not be misrepresented nor misun
derstood, that the movement implies no "antagonism
to the southern section of the State. President
Chipman of the State Board of Trade put the issue
rightly in his statement: "I think it is the duty of
this board. to address its energies especially to the
development of. Northern California, and to that end
we offer co-operation in every possible way with the
effort now being made for organized work to peo
ple this vast and rich country. In justification of my
recommendation I desire to say that although we
constitute a State organization, and have Â¦ avoided
discriminating in our work in \ favor of individual
localities, I regard it to be our duty to help those
parts of the State that need help, and in doing so I
believe we are performing our highest duty to the
State. I believe, also, that the most enlightened
sentiment of Southern California would applaud our
efforts in building up neglected portions of the
State."
BYVT: the speeches made and the action taken at
the meeting of the State Board of, Trade and
of the Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday as
surance is given that those bodies will cordially co
operate with the counties of Northern. California' in
making known their resources and promoting their
industrial and commercial development. Plans have
been devised for a general co-operation in the work
of the various commercial organizations of the city,
and that means something like bringing all San
Francisco into line. It is a movement full of prom
ise and merits cordial support from all quarters.
HANDS ALL AROUND
NATIONAL LAWS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
OF TRUSTS AND PROTECTION OF STATES
most of whom are illiterate. In South Carolina in
1890 there- were 30,000; more negro than white chil
dren in. school, while - t the factories swarmed with
white children. The of one mill, giving
evidence before the Legislature, stated that 60 per
cent of his operatives were under twelve."
\ Such a condition of affairs is not to be tolerated,
and it is gratifying to note a strong. element of the
Southern people earnestly seeking to put an end to
it. " The struggle,- however, is likely to be a long one.
The South has just begun to develop manufacturing
industries, and will be averse to- enacting legisla
tion which, the factory owners regard as hostile." Ef
forts have been repeatedly made in several of the
cotton States to procure, the enactment of child la
bor laws similar to those in Northern States,. but
they have hitherto proven futile. The factory owners
array against the reform movement first the poor
whites who -wish their children, to work in factories,
and, second, Southern sensitiveness to Northern in
terference with Southern problems. â¢ It may take a
long time to overcome such opposition, but in the
erid it must give way. Child labor is too alien to all
American traditions and to all the aims of American
workingmen for its practice to be continued in-,
definitely in even the most backward States.
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL.; THURSDAY, MARCH 13 ,' 1902.
6
AT Harvard' University on . the afternoon of March 10
James B. Dill, the well known corporation lawyer, of
New York, discussed ' the necessity of having "national
laws to â¢Â¦Â¦ govern trusts or . great Industrial combina
'i_ -'-Â¦â¢; ---"Â¦ - tlons." Besides the members of the Harvard Economic
Society, the. address attracted a large assemblage of visitors
interested in the questions growing out of the anti-trust liti
gation before the United States Supreme Court.
Mr. Dill, in opening, made the points (first) that the best
intelligence of the country favored the adoption of national
principles with respect to corporate measures; (second) "that
history showed that In instances where interstate warfare had
affected trade and "commerce unfavorably Federal assumption
of the matters in dispute had frequently resulted, and (third)
.that whenever a force affecting the welfare of the country at
large has been found "to have outgrown , the swaddling
clothes' of the express powers of the constitution and to be en
titled to the protection cf a national law the American people
had always overridden mere technicalities and taken unto them
selve.sthe requisite authority under the implied powers of the
constitution.
Saying that he accepted the term "trust" to signify a "cor
porate aggregation engaged in other than merely local busi
ness, and not confined, in its operations to the State of it3
creation, 'he insisted that the "trust", was national in extent
and an integral part of the best growth and financial develop
ment of the country. * *
-Â¦I. Present State legislation tended to lack of uniformity to
diversity and to direct antagonism. "Charter-granting States
are so shaping their corporate legislation," added Mr Dill,
that their charters will be a product to other than
thehv own citizens. More than this, they are permitting those
or other States who will come to them for charters to do
things which they deny their own citizens. The State of New
York to-day forbids the oiganizatlon of transportation, rail
road and what is commonly known as quasi public corpora
tions to be organized under any other than the particular law
providing such corporations with its restrictions and safe
guards. Nevertheless, that State has before it to-day a bill
making it lawful to forma corporation for the business of
constructing, maintaining and operating a railroad, telephone
or telegraph lines under the business corporations law, pro
vided all operations of these companies shall be carried on
wholly beyond its borders. In other words, New York Is as
suming to grant powers to corporations to carry into effect
outside the State that it will not permit to" be exercised wihin
its own territory."- Â¦
Further, Mr. Dill contended that "State legislation for
revenue" was .most pernicious in tendency, since if the Staje
as a whole was for sale the moral example of the State tended
to make legislators individually for sale.
Mr. Dill contended that the power. for good legislation af
fecting trusts was crippled by the lack of national jurisdic
tion. Each State legislated for itself in disregard of the na
tion's good. The result was confusion and frequent conflict
between Federal and State statutes.
"Americans have not as yet begun to realize," declared Mr.
Dill, "the force and power of these aggregations of capital.
Viewed on the one hand from the standpoint of undoubted
advantage to the country, certain intelligent people are in
clined to do away with all legal restrictions upon the growth
and progress of great organizations. Others, realizing the
dangers which of necessity accompany power of any kind, and
which, when united in combinations, present, if uncontrolled,
more than a menace to our country, are inclined to repress
the trust movement in every possible way." The safe method,
Mr. Dill thought, was not in abolishing trusts, but in properly
applying the principles they represented. The basis of discus
sion respecting the legal control of combinations was not first
utility and then control, but utilization and control par! passu.
Citing several interesting instances of Interstate warfare,
Mr. Dill contended that trusts had outgrown the confines of
mere State legislation and had now become a national force.
He said: "This contest between States has reached the point
where Minnesota has in vain appealed to the Supreme Court
of the United StateB for relief, openly charging New Jersey
with' permitting a great corporation to organize under its laws
for the express purpose of doing what was forbidden in Minne
sota, and what directly affects and was intended to affect
property located in Minnesota. It needs no argument for the
student of corporate legislation to rebch the conclusion that
it is not toward uniformity that State legislation is drifting, but
toward interstate warfare."
Mr. Dill then urged the passage of a Federal law along the
lines of the national banking act, not abridging the powers of
the State to create corporations," but giving the option to
corporations whose business' Is national in extent relating to
trade with foreign countries or between States to organize
under national laws guaranteeing protection against conflict-
Ing State legislation and political enactments. Such an act
should be based upon a public demand for cleaner legislation
and purer politics, and providing:
Firstâ It should be optional, as in the case of the national
banking act, leaving corporations free to organize under State
acts If they choose.
Secondâ It should deny the name "national" to any but
national corporations, compelling other corporations who as
sume that title to change it.
Thirdâ National corporations should have freedom from
State supervision and should be subject' t'o taxation by the
State only to the amount of property actually In the State,
and then upon the same basis 'as an individual.
Fourthâ The national corporation should be subject to na
tional supervision and examination and should require at least
private publicity, would probably also require a degree of pub
lic publicity.
Fifthâ It should be protected from State attack to the same
extent that the national banks are, viz., it should not be sub
ject to attachment or other provisional limitations which pre
vail in any State against non-residents; that is to say. being a
United States corporation,^ should be a citizen of the United
States and a citizen of each State to the extent that It has all
rights of citizens as to attacks in the courts. *
Discussing the practical advantages of such a measure,
Mr. Dill said In conclusion: ' s
"Would corporations avail themselves of the opportunity
to organize under a national law? Yes, for their tendency to
day is to assume a national character. This is shown by the
designations 'United States,' 'American/ 'Federal/ 'National'
and even 'International/ There is a tendency to publicity, at
least to 'private publicity/ on the part of the better class oi
corporations, such as the United States Steel Corporation, the
National Biscuit and others, as a matter of self-preservation.
The tendency In each case Is to publish more and more the
details in order that the good corporations and the sound or
ganizations may show themselves to be in a position where
the others dare not follow them. In making public statement*.
They proceed 'upon the theory that the man six feet tall can
wade through a stream of such depth that a man fiva feet
high would be drowned in the crossing, and the great cor
porations are quite willing to drown In the stream of pub
licity the other corporations who are following In their waku
and attempting to imitate their standing and position.
"No great corporation can be put upon the market without
a financial syndicate. No matter how great or how strong la
that syndicate, it must go to the banks for money. The banks
will not perpetually advance funds upon underwritings or
other securities. So the syndicate ultimately gets to tho pub
lic. The bankers, knowing this, would insist that thÂ© financiers
organize their company under that law which would inspire
the greatest public confidence in order that the publlo would
ultimately Invest.
"Then, too, the law nbould have a requirement that pres
ent combinations might become national combinations upon ' a
theory similar to that by which State banks are entitled to
become national banks. This would be availed of by the sound
corporations for their own good, not only for protection against
imitators and those not able to follow them, but also as a
protection against the diverse and inconsistent laws of the
various States. The tendency of the States is to attract more
and more foreign corporations, and therefore the great cor
porations would avail themselves of the privilege of becoming
a United States corporation, and thereby being: a corporation
foreign to no State, thereby securing to themselves the priv
ileges and immunities of citizens of every State.
"The point of the whole matter is that they would secure
to themselves uniformity of legislation throughout the length
and breadth of the United States. Texas and other States
may drive insurance companies out of their territories, but
they cannot drive national banks out because the national
batik derives its existence from a power higher than that of a
State-created organization. Xo corporation engaged in Inter
state commerce, no corporation desiring to do business
throughout the length and breadth of the country could afford
to be other than a national organization.
"It would not be long before the investing public would
draw the lines sharply between State-created organization:
assuming to do a business national in extent and truly national
corporations. In a word, the successful combination must be
in its nature a national organization in order to even pretenc
to carry out the economic theories upon which it is based
Given a law which creates real national corporations and aT
others would become imitators and be so known to the public.
The public would refuse to take the stock of such an organ
ization on the same principle that it would refuse to take t
counterfeit bill."

Pretty nearly all the hair preparations

Itching of the scalp and in being: a fairly
good dressing: for the hair; but there is
only one that recognizes what causes
dandruff, falling hair and baldness, and
that destroys the cause, a little germâ
and that is Newbro's Herpicide. This
{ germ eats Its way into the scalp, down to
I the hair root, where it saps that vitality
causing dandruff as it digs up the scalp
Into little white scales. Unless It Is de-
stroyed there's no permament stopping of
falling hair and cure of dandruff and

Business in Butter is still of a hand-to-mouth
character, as buyers, expecting heavy supplies
shortly, are purchasing in a small way only,
to nil dally needs. Stocks, while not excessive,
are ample for all current requirements.
Â¦ Cheese is weak in all . positions. Â¦ The Ex
change reduced its quotations to 10c for new
and 9@10c for old. Arrivals are in excess of
the demand. Â¦
. Eggs are again developing strength. They
are being bought up In large lots in the country
for cold storage speculation, .and this demand
has hardened the market. In addition, the re
cent decline has greatly stimulated the con
sumptive demand by placing the goods within
the reach of everybody, as already mentioned.
The storing has cut down the supply In commis
sion merchants' hands to a manageable quanti
ty, and there is no longer extreme pressure to
sell. The Exchange yesterday advanced its
quotations lc, quoting ranch at 13@lio and
gathered at 13c. Â¦

"OthT unfavorable eymptoms are more fre
<jufnt decreases in railroad earnings, losses and
de)i\F caused by storms and symptoms of
frcth labor troubles; all of which will tend to
delay any possible big upward movement in
Â«nis. The crop Eltuation will also soon begin
to enter into calculations. Back of all tlrese
co:ssiileraticns general trade continues fairly
active and satisfactory- Confidence in the fu
tutft remains unshaken, though a more cautious
ftfling pervades all classes of business men,
ard operations which could be conducted with
sufety a year ago would not be attempted now.
This spirit of caution is Just now really the
strongest clement in the situation.
"It would cause no surprise if the market
we-Â» to display a tagging tendency for a
per c^. Very likely the big holders would pro
tect prices frcra any sharp breaks. Just as they
h*vÂ» done fcr the last nine months: but a slow,
moderate reduction of values would probably
meet with little opposition. On the reasonable
4ar lines roo*-Btocks will do to buy for quick
turr.s. opportunities for trading seeming to be
fairly good."
purchases for control of various roads last
rpring not only were the banking resources of
this country utilized, but immense sums were
borrowed in Europe to carry through these
Ueals. Besides this large blocks of American
securities held on the other side were bought
v.-.th ihe same object in view. Now the time
has come when foreign loans must be repaid.
aj= Euroi>e needs the money to invest in home
enterprises and facilitate a recovery from pro
longed depression thete. The vastness of last
year's operations may be gauged by the fact
of the demands for the necessary funds having
be^n so great as to wipe out the enormous
commercial credit balance which had accumu
lated in our favor for several years previous."
It is natural that European investors should
now prefer buying their own properties at de
prt-ssexi prices rather than American securities
ut inflated prices. It is not therefore likely
thst Europe will give us much help in our
security market until the equalization process
bae exhausted itself. No A - ery material relief
can be expected in the money market until
cfter April 1. or until funds locked up in
these lÂ£.rge syndicate and underwriting opera
tions are released. Some big lump sums have
been Ofd up it', the latter, whose release might
at any time cause a sudden and beneficial con
traction in loans. The money, market is thus
the second, if not the first, factor in the situa
tion that requires watching.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says :
"General conditions are unfavorable to free
buying of stocks just now. Bank reserves are
unusually low for this period, while loans are
et hifh-record mark. The money market
therefore is in no condition to stand any im
portant expansion in loans. Very soon the
stringency, Ubual about the let of April, will
be at hand. Gold exports continue and Europe
is likely to make further demands upon our
resources. During the tremendous contest in

NEW YORK. March 12.â There was some
show of animation in to-day's stock market
on an upward range of prices. The strength
did not permeate the whole market, but there
were the usual number of prominent stocks con
cerned in the movement. The most conspicu
ous of these was Amalgamated Copper, in
which there was evidence of liquidation, with
only occasional intermissions, I during which
the fall received a momentary check. The ex
treme decline reached 4Â»g points. The selling
of the stock was accompanied by rumors that
the next dividend will be reduced or passed.
No authoritative information was to be had on
the subject, nor on the many reports that the
marketing of the company's surplus stock had
involved heavy losses. The weakness . of this
stock gave an occasional check to the advance
at other points, but did not materially affect
the stronger tendency of the market. Covering
by alarmed shorts seemed to play a part in the
advance, especially in the coalers, which have
been freely sold on rumors that the anthracite
miners were determined to push demands that
would not be granted.. To-day equally assured
predictions were heard that there would be no
labor troubles in the coal trade and that there
was no room Â¦ for dissatisfaction. There was
no authoritative information on this subject
either. Another case where speculative senti
ment was reversed from that of yesterday was
on the outlook for the winter wheat crop, on
reports of copious rains in Texas and tMe
Southwest.' Buying to cover short contracts
was particularly effective in Missouri Pacific,
which also had the advantage of a decrease In
gross earnings fox* the first week of March. ThÂ«
calmness of the money market was the final
factor of a general character on the strength
in the stock market. .The rate for money is
firm and nobody is found to predict an early
relaxation of rates, but feeling was - reassured
to-day that there was no immediate danger of 4
forcing a condition of stringency. It is sup
posed that the trust companies are putting out
loans at the higher rates and thus relieving
some of the pressure upon the banks. Special
strength was shown to-day by General Electric,
Westinghouse Electric, North American and
the Readings. There were gains of a point or
over for a large number of etocks, which were
modified by a late realizing movement. --
The bond market continues rather. Irregular
and moderately active. Total sales, par value,
f 2.340.CO0.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

Receipts of Bay Vegetables were 77 bxs As
paragus, 26S bxs Rhubarb and 60 sks of Peas.
Asparagus continues to bring good prices,
and fancy stock was scarce and slightly high
er Rhubarb took quite a drop and there was
much poor stock offering. Peas from the Bay
sold well owing to the light receipts of Los
Angeles. Only 9 of the latter were received.
Los Angeles Tomatoes came to hand in poor
condition and were offering freely at low
prices Mexican Tomatoes sold well, but were
weak owing to the large supplies on hand.
There were no Mushrooms received.

Onions were fairly active, but the top quo
tation was difficult to obtain for mo3t offer
ings. Fancy stock was scarce. The Austra
lian steamer brought 1135 crates from, the Col
onies.
The Potato market was strong and active for
choice Burb'anks, and some lots of strictly fan
cy Burbanks.from Oregon sold over the quota
tions. There 1b not much movement in Seed
Potatoes at present, as the soil is too wet for
planting and goods of this description are dull.
One car of Sweet Potatoes came in from Mer
ced, making the fourth car received since Mon
day, and the stock sold readily.

< Magnus states that "the remarks which

Mons. Alphonsa Bousquet haÂ» dis
charged a pompom In the French Hos

the gentle , nurses will have to
lay aside their dainty caps and snow

bedside of the patients.
Alphonse took care to submit his reso
lution, drawn to bring about such a
change, in cold, bold writing and at such
a time when 3200 miles were between him
self and the directors of the French Ben
evolent Socity, for it is said that Alphonse
is at present in Paris.
Mons. Alexander Mlqueu, the superin
tendent of the hospital, was seen last

nurses, lie failed to pee. ho said, why
there should be any change., since the
nurses were attentive to their duties.
There never was such harmony in the in
stitution as at present. Each and every
nurse, he declared, was as demure as any
one of "three little maids from school"
of Gllbertian origin. Ho expressed his be
lief that the resolution submitted by his
friend, Alphonse Bousquet, will be smoth
ered by an avalanche of negative votes.
J. M. Dupais, the president of tho French.
Benevolent Society, was seen at a meet
ing of his confreres and proclaimed him

EL. PASO, Texas, March 12.â A man giv
ing his name as John M. Bernhardt and
his residence San Francisco was arrested
late last night by the police on the suspi
cion that he was the murderer of Nora
Fuller. After remaining in a cell until
9 o'clock this morning the prisoner was
released, for his papers showed that he
had been in San Francisco but a short
time, while Bennett was a resident of
many years.
Bernhardt had a through ticket to Chi
cago. He acted suspiciously here and
afterwards became intoxicated. The police
shadowed him for hours and finally took
him into custody. He is about 35 years of
age, 1 rather handsome, with light hair and
mustache and comparatively well
dressed. He was terribly frightened this
morning when taken before the Chief for
examination. __ _^ \

QUICK APOLOGY
Mrs. Bradstreet informed Officer Owen
that Mrs. ChaATee, a lodger in her house
heard a noise on the porch and was afraid
to stay in her room because she feared
burglars. Mrs. Bradstreet armed herself
with a poker and went out to Investigate.
She heard footsteps in tho alleyway and
In the darkness saw the shadow of a man.
Mrs. Chaffee rushed In and told Mrs.
Bradstreet that there- was a burglar in
the alleyway, and Cecil, her son, picked
up his revolver and hurried out to the
porch. ' He saw the man going over the
fence and knowing he would escape by
the Fell-street entrance to the alley.way
he rushed down his front stairs and hur
ried around to Fell street.
Cecil saw a man hurrying up Fell
street, however, and imagining this w r as
the burglar, he called upon him to halt.
Instead of obeying the command, the
pedestrian took to his heels. Bradstreet
gave chase and fired two shots into the
air to Intimidate the runner. This had
its effect. Bradstreet caught up with him
and at the point of a pistol loaded with
blank cartridges, he forced the man to
return with him to the house. The al
leged burglar proved to be a student in
chemistry, who had just left the drug
store owned by City Chemist Green,
which is located at the corner of Fell and
Devisadero streets. His explanation be
ing satisfactory, Bradstreet allowed him
to depart. <
Bradstreet is of the opinion that the
burglar made his escape by jumping over
another fence. Mrs. Bradstreet des
cribes the man as being 5 feet 8 inches in
height and wearing an overcoat and
slouch hat.
Residents in the vicinity of Fell and
Devisadero ctrcets were startled by the
wound of two pistol shots at 10 o'clo'ck
last evening. Cecil Bradstreet, who lives
at 448 Divisadero etnet tired the shots at
a supposed burglar. lie brought, the man
to a standstill and took him back to his
home. The man he captured proved to
be a student In chemistry who happened
to be going homo.
Charles Brooks, who attempted to se
cure $1000 from the estate of Rachael
Jeans by reason of an alleged aifte-mor

away empty-handed.
Joseph Bcrnardl failed to prove his part
ettship In the Maximilian mine In the
gutter Creek district, Ainador County. He
e'eimed that there was a.n oral agreement
as to partnership in the mine between
himself and a former owner, who has
since died. Bernardi's unsupported Etate
ipent was held to be of no legal import
in the matter and Judgment was entered
in favor of Annie E. Allen, who is now
in control of the property.

Places Assigned on Moiit.
I have not considered the office of Mayor
merely as a storehouse of patronage, for the
distribution of â¢ small political positions, but
have looked upon it in a much broader light,
ee an office to be administered upon sound and
conservative business principles, for the ad
vantage and equal benefit of all elements of
the community, and for the progress and pros
perity of our entire population. â¢
Much to my pleasure I have found myself
pustained and upheld by the great mabse* of
the labor element end wage-earners of the
city, by all good citizen* and by the respectable
press, and 1 am proud of the confidence which
they manifest in me. But. and I fay it with
resr*t, 1 have been hampered and annoyed al
most beyond endurance by a umall coterie of
place-hunting, professional labor politician?,
who think that there U nothing In the cause
of labor except a few petty places for them
selves, and who have pestered and Importuned
me from day to day. and from week to week.
to give them positions and. sa la lie*, no matter
Â¦ t what coat to the people and to ourselvee,
and have insisted, so as to make room for
themselves, on my removing, with or without
cause and without reierrnrp to the charter or
ltw or civil service DrovUioni". rommlMlon
cr* and every other official who etandir In the
way of the political Job wliloh they have re
spectively eelscteU for themselvc*.
Not a Patronage Storehouse.
I have tried not to involve the cause of labor
in polities: and political Intrigues, but have
consistently advocated the duty of all coo>l
citizens, including the great masses of the
wtge workers, to perform their civic obliga
tions, and to strive by intelligent end honoi
atle use of the. ballot for a better government
and a better social condition. 1 have urged
them to join with the hest people for the best
government. 1 have advised them to oppose
the corrupt and demoralizing: boss elements,
wherever found, because their influence is per
nicious and always Injurious to the masses.
To this* extent and to this extent alone did I
conceive it their duty and their inclination to
take part In political affairs. I have en
deavored in niy own administration to live up
to these principles. ,
My object has ever been, ag it will still con
tinue to be, 10 better the condition of the
laboring: man, soeiallv, industrially and finan
cially.
However, in order that t!ie nubiic may
clearly comprehend the situation I am willing
to mike a brief statement. Since takine ot
flce as Mayor 1 have endeavored to Justify the
confidence or those who supported iiw and of
the community generally by following a clean,
honest and conservative" courae, hoping that
the wage-earner way. in some manner through
me. acquire and hold the full esteem and re
spect of all of his fellow citizens, and that
the fallacious ideas which have to gsjjie ex
tent heretofore prevailed that â¢the wage
worker is not able, intelligent or conservative
enough to be entrusted with equal participa
tion and representation In the affairs of gov
ernment might be dispelled.
Administration Is Honest.
It lia<l been my Intention to pas-n over Ih
tOler.cf th* etatements contained In this even
ing's Bulletin concerning th<s purported action
taken by a portion of th* Union Labor party
oxecutlva committee with reference to my
policy in maklnu appointments to otflio.
The Bulletin^ references to ray admiuistva
tlon or to myself have without cause always
been eo venomous, mulirioun and lulse that

bring on some disorder of the bowclm,
and i% frequently the cause of append!-
citl>=.
The etarches sre not digested in tha
Upper etomach, but are treated In the du-
odonum and from there on- down through
thft whole length of the bowels. Conse-
quently, if. too much starchy food is
uÂ«d, particularly white bread, trouble is
likely to set up. White bread docs not
contain the dJastatic principles which na-
ture placed in the wrioat berry to help
digest Etarch, but tbe white flour miller
leaves that part out.
Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food was per-
fected purposely to supply the starch of
the. cereals and the other parts Intended
by r.ature for use, and presents them to
the body in a form that will easily be
digested. In fact, they are predigested
by a natural means during the process of
manufacture, so that one can get all the
energy and value from that sort of food
without overloading the organs.
A man from Brantford, Ont., says: "For
the first twenty years of my life I lived
out of doors, then I took up my present
employment, which is Indoors, and re-
â¢julrcs the exercise of thÂ« brain rather
than the body.
"Gradually a languid feeling took pos-
tsesfion of me, which developed into dys-
PfcrMa and later into constipation. These
conditions continued for several years in
epite of pills and laxatives without num-
ber. Aft^r a time I began to. Buffer from
great lack of vitality and from time to
time with cramps in the bowels which
usually laid me up for three or four
days. Finally the physician discovered
that I was on the point of appendicitis.
After one cf these severe attacks* about
eIx months ago, a neighbor brought in
part of a packago of Grape-Nuts to try,
and I noticed trm good results from tha
first, and have continued to use the food
Jji placp of whitÂ« bread and cereals I
formerly used.
"I have gained considerably in weight,
feel" much better than 1 have in rears.
my complexion hap cleared up, digestion
it? sood. and I hav*> not had a cramp
since starting; but more important than
all e)s*\ I notified a distinct clearness of i
mind puf.talnfd by an energy and nerve
force that I have not known before.
"I have learned nu exceedingly valu-
able lesson in living end will not, here-
after, load myself down with food .re-
quiring too much bulk to supply: a suffl.
cif-nt amount of nourishment as I used to.
This lsason In moderation in diet, and
knowing how to eelect proper food \%
north everything to me." Name fur-

am enjoying excellent health for a sun
of my age, due entirely to the Teja^a-

It brings sleep and rest when nothing
else will, and gives strength *mi vital-

Schlesinger attacked the Indictment,
which had been drawn by Assistant

charge the defendant with any crime;
that it failed to avey that the articles al
leged to have been smuggled had been
clandestinely brought into the United
States; that it had failed to charge also
that there was an Intention on the part
of the defendant to defraud the revenue
of the United States, and that It had failed
to allege thatUhe articles had not been
invoiced. The motion for a new trial was
made on the additional ground that no
evidence had been introduced to show
that the duties on the goods had not been
P \)nlted' States District Attorney Wood
worth, who assisted in the prosecution of
the case, contended that Schlesinger's ob
jections should have been made on de
murrer and before the trial and that the
indictment had been drawn in conformity
with the provisions of the statute.
Judge de Haven made a few remarks
to the/effect that it was no crime to im
port goods into the United States without
paying the duties, forfeiture of the goods
being the penalty. To make such an act
a crime it would be necessary to charge
and prove that the goods were imported
with the intent to defraud the revenue of
the Government. The matter was taken
under advisement. .-"..Â¦'Â¦

WITH a pistol-shot F. A. Dodge
adjourned a stock-Adders'
meeting of the Perry Com
bined Hammer and Nail Ex
tractor Company at. 36. Geary
street yesterday afternoon, and Joseph R.
Young, secretary of the company, claims
that Dodge's end and aim was to' make
him the target of the bullet. Dodge says
he merely drew the revolver to repel an
attack by Young and that it was dis
charged accidentally. â¢' â¢ â¢ - â¢
There has been considerable friction be
tween two factions of the stockholders for
some time past, which culminated in a
meeting where a series of resolutions
were presented reflecting on some of the
directors. The resolutions were read, by
Young as secretary and when he had fin
ished readlnsr he commenced to comment
on the statements contained in them.
Dodge was sitting on a sofa at the oppo
site side of the room and he called Young
a liar. Young rushed over to him and
struck him and then Dodge drew his
pistol and it was discharged. According
to Young and his friends. Dodge made
an attempt to shoot a second time at James
Haworth, an aged gentleman, who is con
ductor in the United States Mint, but was
caught by C. E. Perry, one of the direc
tors, who forced him to return the re
volver to his pocket. One of the men
present called in a policeman, who placed
Dodge under arrest. He was taken to the
City Prison and charged with assault with
intent to kill. He -was unable to secure
bail last night, but said he would obtain
his release to-day.
Joseph S. Young, who resides at 1462
Eddy street, insists that Dodge made an
attempt to murder him and says he will
prosecute him relentlessly.
"He called me a liar," he said last,
night, "and I hit him. I am 62 years old,
but nobody can call me a liar and not get
hit. Dodge then drew his gun and pointed
it at- me. -'Shoot, you ,' said I, and
he shot. Then he tried to shot again at
my friend. Mr. Haworth, but Mr. Perry
caught him and forced him to nut his
gun into his pocket. Mr. Robinson, one
of the directors, called a -policeman and
Dodge was taken away to jail."
James Haworth, whose 72 years have
not cooled his fighting blood and who took
a determined part in .the entire proceed
ing, corroborated Young's account of the
affair, as did A. W. Robinson, another
of the directors. â¢â¢ <
Dodge was seen at the prison and main
tained that the discharge of the revolver
was accidental. He is a real estate specu
lator and lives at 225 Guerrero street.. He
said:
"I went to the meeting armed because
I had quarreled with Young before and I
understood tbat he had made threats
against my life. When he rushed over to
. attack me I pulled my pistol and he
stopped. In some way, which I cannot
explain, the hammer of the revolver be
came cocked and while 1 was trying to
let it down the weapon was discharged.
That I did not shot at Young is shown
by the fact that the bullet lodged in the

the pistol, 1 so T certainly did not try to

The case was continued till this morn
ing, when it will probably be dismissed
for lack'of a motive to defraud, but J.
Morgan Smith may hear something drop.
Crowther detailed how he had gone to
Oakland with ! a son of Attorney Good
fellow and when he saw the articles in
the afternoon papers he told Mr. Good
fellow the whole story and was advised
to go to the city next morning and tele
phone to Robinson and explain matters
to him. He did so, but Robinson would
not meet him. He honestly believed the
check to be genuine, otherwise he would
not have used it. He reiterated the state
ment that Smith was to receive $10 from
him.
The Judge asked Smith if he remember
ed asking Crowther for the $10 and Smith
denied it.
Crowther Sticks to His Tale.
story in a straightforward, modest way.
He seemed extremely nervous, as he al
ways wet his lips with his tongue after
each sentence. He said he was 22 years
old and was born in Philadelphia. Since
he was 15 years of age he had lived in
Kobe. Japan, where his father was an ex
porter and importer. He detailed his
meeting with Smith and his getting thÂ»
check, which he believed to be genuine.
He said Smith had walked with him to
the O'Farrell-street car and had asked
him for $10 out of the money he was to
receive from Robinson after paying his
bill. He was to meet Smith in .Green
Bros.' saloon. He met him there and tokl
him that Robinson had only given him $5
and a check for $17 45. Smith asked for
the check for $17 45, saying he would get
it cashed at the bar, but Crowther sa>d
he did not do business that way and would
go to the Palace Hotel and get It cashed.
There Is a large field of aspirants for
Congressional honors in the newly carved
Eighth District. The counties of San
Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura,
Ktrn. Tulare. Inyo, San Bernardino
Orange, Riverside and San Diego comprise
the district, San Diego presents three
candidates for the Republican- nomina
tion. Postmaster Luce having recently en
tered the list. Collier and Nutt were
lighting for delegates when the Postmas
ter declared himself in the fray. . Captain
Daniels of Riverside will have supporters
lu the convention. State Senator Smith
of Kern is an active candidate. His
friends claim that he will go to the con
vention with the support of five counties
New Eighth. District.
James McLachlan, according to all ac
counts. Is likely to be renominated anJ
it-elected to Congress in the new Sev
enth District. I^os Angeles County alone
comprises the district. McLachlan's suc
cess in securing the San Pedro harbor al
lowance and his general inclination -to
serve his constituents commend him to
the Republicans. Los Angeles County
will be the scene of a redhcu engagement
in the gubernatorial campaign.
The politicians who are telling the Gov
ernor that he is sure to get a solid dele
gation from Los Angeles are filling his
Gageship with hot air. The anti-Gage
sentiment in the south Is widespread an<J
vigorously expressed. Los Angeles Coun
ty gave McKlnley 48<X) majority. Repub
licans who are pretty well posted assert
that Gage, if nominated, would lose the
county, provided the Democrats put a
fairly good man In the field. The indica
tions are that San Diego, San Bernardino.
Riverside, Orange and Los Angeles coun
ties will send to the State convention del
vgations opposed to the nomination of
Cage. It is understood that McLachlan
ts keeping clear of the gubernatorial
Krlfe.
Los Angeles District.
The Democrats regard the Sixth District
as fighting ground. They talk of nomin
ating: Judge Conley of Madera. It is con
ceded that J. C. Needham, now represent
<!:i' the old Seventh, will be the Republi
can nominee in the new Sixth District.
The counties of Santa Cruz. Monterty,
S^n Benito. Fresno, Kings. Madera,
Merced, Stanislaus and San Joaquin com
prise the district in which Needham and
conley reside.
Eugene F. Loud has so amply demon
strated his worth and ability as a Repre
sentative in Congress and has attained so
much influence in affairs at Washington
tl.at the Republicans of the Fifth Dis
trict will renominate and re-elect him.
The district embraces several Assembly
ojstricts of San Francisco and the coun
ties of San Mateo and Santa Clara.
The Republican column in the Fourth
Congressional District has been rein
forced by the addition of two strong Re
publican Assembly districts â the Fortieth
and Forty-first, but this reinforcement
dues not signify that Julius Kahn will
::ave a walkover for either the nomina
tion or election.
Congressman Loud Will Be Returned.
Metcalf is regarded as a public man
of excellent poise and superior attain
ments. It Is common political gossip that
he is training to succeed Perkins in the
Senate six years bj?nce, but in the mean
time he may be brought forward to suc
ceed Gage.
The Republicans of the Third Congres-
Fional District are not counting on the
advent of any candidate other than
Victor H. Metcalf. The district embraces
the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa
end Solano. There is talk that Metcalf
may be called on to head the State ticket.
Gage has so completely surrendered the
administration of State affairs to po
litical bosses, professional agitators and
the blatant promoters of class prejudice
'hat the orderly and industrious people
cf the commonwealth are beginning to
believe that ae -is no better than the
bosses behind him.
Frank L. Coombs of Napa, now serving
in Congress as the representative of the
old First District, is likely to receive the
Republican nomination to represent the
new Second District. The counties com
prising the second are Mendoclno, Glenn,
Colusa, Butte, Sutter, Yuba, Sacramento,
"Volo, Lake, Napa, Sonoma and Maria.
Recent happenings in Humboldt County
icad the politicians to believe â¢ that ex-
Senator Gillette will go to the convention
supported by a solid delegation from his
own county. One year ago it was com
mon gossip in the political circles of
Northern California that Giilette had In
curred the hostility of J. C. Bull, and
therefore could not obtain the influence
cf a solid Humboldt delegation. Word
now comes from the north that Bull and
Gillette have adjusted their differences
and are working together with perfect
harmony. Gillette has also secured as
surance of 6upport from many of the
mining counties of the district. Poli
ticians would not be surprised if he were
nominated by acclamation.
Coombs Likely to Be Benominated.
There are no indications that the Demo
crats will be able to break the solid Cali
fornia Republican delegation in Congress.
Several interesting contests for Congres
sional nominations are foreshadowed.
The leading aspirants in the First Dis
trict hail from Humboldt County. Sen
ator Thomas Selvage and ex-Senator J.
N. Gillette, well-known residents of that
county, are making special efforts to en
list the support of the delegations.' The
district is extensive from a territorial
point cf view. It embraces the counties
of Del Norte, Humboldt, Sisklyou, Trin
ity, Tehama, Shasta, Modoc. Lassen. Plu
mas. Sierra, Nevada, Placer. El Dorado,
Amador, Calaveras. Alpine, Mono, Mari
posa and Tuolumne.
Lowrie arose from his scat and said in
a loud voice: "Don't call upon me as a
mutual acquaintance. I won't claim that
distinction."
The Judge then read to Smith the sec
tion of the Penal Code defining forgery
and Smith said there was no intention to
defraud on hJs part. If Crowther had not
asked in such an asinine manner, he said,
and had come to Green Bros.', where he
had arranged to meet him, he would have
then told him that it was all a joke.
Crowther> was then called and told his
Lowrie Seems Insulted.
This clcsed the case f6r the prosecution
and J. Morgan Smith was 7 called for the
defense. He detailed in 1 a nonchalant
n anner how he had met Crowther at the
Yellowstone Bar. He was talking to a
mutual acquaintance and was not for
mally introduced. Crowther told him he
had no funds and was waiting for money
from Scotland, and Smith either offered
or Crowther asked for $100, the witness
said he did^not remember which. .
"It struck me as ridiculous," continued
Smith, "that on a first acquaintance he
should expect a loan of $100 from me, as
I had only 25 cents in ray pocket at the
time, and as a joke I wrote out the check
for $100, signing it W. B. Vincent, and not
thinking he would be fool enough to cash
it. I thought he would take It to the
bank in the morning and get the laugh.
It was- no forgery, as I don't know any
man of the name of W. B. Vincent. 1 It
was just- the first name that came into
my head." ,
"How long have you studied law, Mr.
Smith?" asked the Judge. "I think you
have quite an erroneous opinion of the
lrw on forgery." j
Smith disclaimed any knowledge of tha
law and said he expected Crowther to
return and played shuffleboard for some
time, but. he did not turn up. Crowther
said he was going to the Palace Hotel to
get the check cashed and Smith began to
realize what a silly thing he had done. He
did noftell Crowther the check was given
as a joke and thought Crowther would
see the ridiculous side of it. Smith said
the mutual acquaintance he had alluded
to was named Lowrie.
Smith Explains the Joke.
Mrs. Florence Robinson, wife of the pre
ceding witness, testified to having taken
the check to her own bank and was in
structed to get it certified at the Wells-
Fargo Bank. She went there and v/as in
formed that W.-B. Vincent did not have
an account at the bank. She returned to
her own bank and was advised to place
the matter in the hands of the police. H.
L. Miller, assistant cashier In the Wells-
Fargo Bank, testified that no such person
as "\V. B. Vincent had an account there.
Robinson was the first witness called
and testified to receiving the check for
$100 from Crowther on March 5. Crowther
had paid him $109 on February 16 for his
first month's board and lodging and other
bills, but he became suspicious of him, or
as he â¢ expressed it, he- was "not- good
pay," and March 2 told him that. he must
leave. Crowther then owed $45 35 and $32 20
for laundry bills, livery and other things,
amounting altogether to $77 55. On tne
night of March 5 Crowther called with the
check for $100 on the Wells-Fargo Bank,
signed "W. 'B. Vincent," and he ana
Crowther indorsed it. Crowther wanted
the balance In cash, but he gave him his
own check for $17 45 and $5 cash. Next
day he learned that the check was worth
less and notified the police. In cross
examination he admitted that he had been
paid' in full by Crowther and had handed
over his effects. He did not wish to prose
cute the case. Crowther had made com
plaint to him of things having been
stolen from his room. Crowther had tele
phoned to him on the morning of March
7 to meet him, but he did not do so.
Robinson Tells His Story.
J. Morgan Smith completely over
shadowed J. Pollard Crowther, the young
society man from Kobe, Japan, at Crow
ther's preliminary examination before
Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge of
passing a fictitious check and it Is within
the range of probability that Smith may
have to answer to a charge of forgery in
connection with the check for $100 which
he gave Crowthex as a huge joke. Crow
ther positively swore that Smith was to
get $10 from him out of the money he was
to receive in change from J. A- Robinson
of the Knickerbocker Hotel after paying
his board bill with the check, but Smith,
who had by* this time realized that his
joke might develop into something seri
ous, contradicted Crowther flatly in that
respect.
â The courtroom was crowded and a great
'deal of Interest seemed to be taken In the
case. The sympathies of those who heard
the testimony were apparently with
Crowther, who had been made the inno
cent victim of Smith's jocular disposition.
Crowther was represented by Attorneys
"Van fleet and Craig, who .introduced a
receipt in full by Landlord 'Robinson for
the money due him by " Crowther and
Robinson admitted that Crowther had
paid him the money yesterday morning
and he did not want to prosecute him. -
