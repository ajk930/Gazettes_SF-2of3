PROMINENT RAILWAY OFFICIALS WHO: TREATED WITH STRIKERS.
Continued on Page Four.
THE expectation that the strike
of the streetcar men would'- be
adjusted yesterday was not real
ized. The prospects of an^ ad
justment of the controversy
some time to-day, however,
were excellent at midnight, and
if both parties to the struggle are willing
to make certain concessions "which will be
demanded, there is little doubt that ,the
strike will be declared off before night
fall.
While the deliberations of the executive
committee of the United Railroads yes
terday morning were executive, It'- is
known that many of the demands of the
strikers were favorably ' considered. The
members of the committee,' without'ex
ception, admitted that the chances of an
early settlement of the trouble were good,'
but they declined to state what demands
they favored or which of them they were
In favor of refusing. The Inference was
plan that as far the committee was con
cerned, the only question was the advis
ability of consenting to the raise of wages,
by which the payroll of the company
would be swelled annually to the extent
of $300,000. None of the directors was
willing to commit himself upon this point
until the sentiments of the Eastern own
ers was ascertained. It Is understood that
on all other demands, as submitted, the
committee, with minor modifications, re
ported in favor of granting them. The
members of the executive committee, who
considered the propositions were. Messrs.
Holland., Hellman. Tobln, Holbrook and
Ford. â¢
DIRECTORS IN SESSION.
The individual reports of the executive
committee were considered during the'
afternoon by the board of directors. The
discussion was a quiet one and it was
evident that the gentlemen were willing
to do all In their power to end the strike.:
The only question was as to their powers.;
The directors decided ' before talking final;

was the history of the strike from the
railroad officials' side yesterday. At both
meetings the agreement presented by the
union _carÂ» men was carefully discussed
and it is known that many clauses in this
covenant have already been consented to
by. the' men .who represent the capitalist
side' of the fight.
- The executive council is composed of
President Holland, Tirey L. Ford, Joseph

and â¢ cross-questioned them In . reference
to the working hours of the motormen
and the gripmen'. and the length of the
runs. This information was obtained so
that the executive committee might more
clearly understand whether it would be
able to concede to the striking car men's
demands.'

BALMORAL, Transvaal, April 24.âSec
retary of State Reitz of the Transvaal,
Lucas Meyer, commander in chief of the
Orange Free State forces, and other mem
bers of their party, who arrived here last
night, have concluded their conferences
with the burghers composing General
Lucas Meyer's command. Nothing has
leaked out regarding the result. Secre
tary Reltz returned here yesterday, and
proceeded to Pietersburg to meet Com
mandant Beyers.
The Government leader, Balfour, an
nounced that an autumn session of the
House would be necessary to deal with
arrears of legislation.
CONIERENCES WITH BUBGHEBS.
Ealfour, the Government leader, .came
to the support of the sorely tried War
Secretary, and contended that the Gov
ernment was justified in detaining even a
Eritish subject if it thought his wander
ings were calculated to injure the inter
ests of South Africa. Those voting for the
adjournment would be condemning Lord
Kitchener and Lord Milner, in whose
keeping at this moment rested the hopes
lor peace.
MINISTERS AEE TWITTED.
James Bryce (Liberal) and Sir Robert
Reid (Liberal) twitted the Ministers for
again Interposing Lord Kitchener as a
buffer between' the Government and the
House. They both denounced the present
action of the Government as a gross abuse
Â¦of power.
The spirit of revolt spread to the Gov
ernment benches. Ian Malcolm (Con
servative), who Is said to have been here
tofore an unswerving supporter of the
Government, warmly repudiated Balfour's
argument that those voting for the ad
journment would be showing themselves
careless of British honor. After such an
Incident he no longer felt sure that the
members of the Government could gay
they had clean hands in this regard. War
er peace would not be facilitated by such
violations of the liberty of a subject.
Other suporters of the Government fol
lowed in the same strain. The House
then divided* and the motion for adjourn
ment was defeated by 258 to 182.
Winston Spencer Churchill, Conserva
tive, also delivered a few caustic sen
tences, saying he hoped the House would
fcrce the Go\-ernment to withdraw within
the limits of the law and observe the cou
ctitution.
This brought forth a protest from Sir
"William Vernon Harcourt. Liberal, who
declared that such a proposition was
scandalous and contrary to the ele
mentary principles of freedom.

BE.0DRICK RAISES ' STORM.
Jchn Morley, Liberal, moved the ad
journment of the House, the success of
which proposition would practically
emount to a vote of censure on the Gov
ernment in general and on Lord Kitchen
er and Lord Milner in particular. Morley
pointed out that Cartwright, who liad
served a year's imprisonment for libel,
now desired to come to England, and that
Iiis detention was illegal, unconstitu
tional and tyrannical. He added that the
explanation of Lord Stanley, the Finan
cial Secretary of the War Office, who
Bcrved in the South African war as chief
-press censor, that the Government did
not think It desirable to Increase the
ramber of anti-British propagandists in
this country, was the most outrageous
thing heard in the House since Simon de
Ucntfort invented Parliament.

WASHINGTON, April 24,â William H.
'Cfhadwick, chairman of the transporta
tion committee of the Board of Trade of
Chicago, has written a letter to Repre
sentative Newlanda of Nevada, the au
thor of ; the pending-irrigation bill, sug_
gestlng new reasons why t the measure
should be 'passed. He says:
Senator Money .swore to a warrant for
the arrest of James E. Hooper, a member
of the local fire department, who waa thfl
passenger that aided the conductor. Later
Senator Money preferred verbal charges
against Hooper before the Board of Com
missioners of the District of Columbia.
The Senator also wrote the president of
the traction company, demanding the im
mediate discharge of Conductor Shaner. .
The Senator was- not badly hurt, but
his trip to Baltimore was prevented. He,
however, proceeded with his customary
duties about the Capitol during the day
as if nothing unusual had occurred.
Later in the day the conductor, . who
proved to be O. H. Shaner, was arrested
on a' warrant sworn out by Senator
Money. Shaner says he did not strike the
Senator until the latter drew his knife
and that he did not make any effort to put
him off the car while it was in motion.
' After this proceeding 1 other persons
stepped between the two, but, \ notwith
standing their presence, the conductor,
who. was a very tall. man,. struck 3 him an
other* blow -over -the sfhoulder of a man
standing between them. This /blow was
struck with the conductor's bloody hand,
and it hit the Senator squarely on the
jaw. He was as a conseauence of this
blow covered with blood from the wounds
of the conductor, and this circumstance
was responsible for a rumor that the Sen-t
ator himself had been severely injured.
The Senator adds that there were three or
four policemen present, but that none of
them took any steps to prevent the alter
cation. He says also that both the con
ductor and the passenger who assisted
in his ejectment refused to give their
names. Â¦
Policemen Do Not Fight.
The Senator says that when they first
undertook to eject him the car was in full
motion and he feels that if they had suc
ceeded at that time he would inevitably
have been badly hurt. The conductor and
his assistant did not, however, succeed in
their design until the car stopped at the
next corner to let off other passengers.
He says that both the conductor and the
passenger were very gruff and abusive in
their language and that after he had
reached the street the conductor hit him
a severe blow over the heart with his
clenched fist. -The blow, the Senator says,
was very painful, and in order to protect
himself he took a small pocket-knife from
his pocket and. opened it. This weapon
the conductor' grasped*' and in doing so
cut his hand so that it bled very freely.
The conductor replied that -the Senator
would have to produce a. ticket or pay his
fare, whereupon the Senator jtold him that
he had paid one fare and being entitled to
a transfer, which he had asked for, but
had not. received, he would not pay an
other. Thereupon the conductor told him
that if he would not pay his fare he would
put him off the car and immediately pro
ceeded to carry his threat into execution.
This the .Senator resisted by grasping an
upright post and engaged in a struggle
with the conductor, who was not mak
ing much headway, when a passenger,
who had been sitting next to Senator
Money, volunteered to assist the conduc
tor. ,By their combined strength they con
trived to break the Senator's hold upon
the post and force him from the car.
Conductor Strikes First Blow.
WASHINGTON, April/ 24.-Senator H.
D. Money of Mississippi had "an alterca
tion with a conductor on a streetcar this
morning, which resulted in the Senator's
.receiving two severe blows from the con
ductor and the, conductor being cut quite
severely on the -right hand with a knife.'
As Senator; Money relates the circum
stances, he was riding .from his home. to
the Baltimore and Ohio depot to take the
9 o'clock train on that road for Baltimore,
where he goes frequently for medical
treatment for his eyes. â¢ He had taken a
car on the Fourteenth-street branch of
the Capital Traction line and had
chanced, to board a car which 'stopped at
the Peace Monument, half a dozen blocks
short of his destination. "He had failed
to notice . this circumstance until the car
began to turn around the monument. The
car bound for the depot was immediately
behind the car on which he was seated.
The Senator says that he had only three
or four minutes .in .which, to make his
train, but that after he discovered " he
was on : the .wrong ,car he called to the
conductor and asked him for a transfer
ticket to the car bound for the depot. He
does not recall â¢ what the conductor re
plied, but failing to receive the ticket and
recognizing: that he had no time. to lose,
he Jumped ' from the car he was on and
boardea the other. He had no! sooner
taken his seat, he says, than the con
ductor of that car approached him and
asked him* for his ticKet. He then told
the conductor, that he had not had time to
secure a transfer and reminded him that
he, the conductor, had been a witness to
circumstances of his change from one car
to the other. "

ARGHBISHOP CORRIGAN SUFFERS
FROM AN ATTACK OF PNEUMONIA
China will undoubtedly accept the
terms, unless she is able to obtain suf
ficient support from the foreign Â«Govern
ments to enable her to resist the pressure
of those nations which approve the agree
ment. Singly, the objection of the United
States would be unavailing, especially In
view of the fact that it has had no par
ticipation whatever in the negotiations of
which the agreement is the result.
The Chinese are authorized to have but
one man of war at Taku and. are pro
hibited from placing mines or torpedoes in
Pel ho River.
As drafted by the military officers, the
agreement makes provision for the perm
anent occupation of- points in North
China.. Two' places are Â¦ named for the
use of foreign troops in the summer sea
son. The Chinese are not allowed to
maintain a garrison In Tientsin nor to
send troops into that city to suppress riots
or other disorders. ' The foreign soldiers
are allowed to freely pass through the
city and their arrest by. Chinese is for
bidden. ,
All of the powers with the exception of
Germany were willing to evacuate the
native city. In reply to recent interna
tional Inquiries. Germany indicated her
purpose to retain a garrison at Tientsin.
Her military agent at that point, how
ever, is a party to the agreement drafted
by the foreign commanders and it Is not
considered likely that he signed the docu
ment without' instructions from Berlin.
As the agreement must be approved by
the diplomatic representatives of the pow
ers in Peking and as the German Minister
is absent, it is not certain that it will be
finally adopted.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W. t - WASHINGTON," April 24.-Promlse
of the evacuation of Tientsin, China, has
at last been, made by the foreign powers
having troops stationed in that city. The
commanders of the military forces at that
point have, according to advices received
fn Washington, signed an agreement set
ting forth the terms upon which they will
withdraw. These terms are so onerous
in character that, the United States may
deem It advisable to enter a strong pro
test against their acceptance. The pow
ers represented in Tientsin are Great
Britain. Germany, France, Austria, Italy
and Japan.

LONDON, April 24.-In the House of
Commons to-day the Secretary of the Ad
miralty, Hugh O.-A. Reynold-Forester,
replying to a question, said the Admiralty
was considering the whole matter of ship
subsidies with the view of defining the
rights of the Admiralty in the event of
contingenices arising, such as the sug
gested shipping combine. When the pres.
ent form of agreement was settled upon
no trade combinations under. foreign con
trol were contemplated, but the Admiralty
had ' appointed a "committee to consider
and report on the purpose and form of fu
ture subsidy agreements. The Admiralty,
meanwhile, had- made arrangements with
the White Star Line, which preclude the
possibility of any of their armed cruis
ers or merchant steamers being trans
ferred to a foreign nag without the con
sent of the Admiralty during the unex
pired portion of the Admiralty agree
ments. Important legal points were in
volved, including the question whether, in
the event of war, there was anything to
prevent the companies from substituting
a foreign for the British flasr at short
notice and whether the Admiralty has the
means of enforcing its right of pre-emp
tion or hire In such case; or if by aban
doning Â¦â¢ the subvention the. companies
could claim that the right of pre-emption
ceased. All such points would be care
fully considered and the 'Admiralty's
rights would be ascertained.
It was said this afternoon that the
present uncertain position of the Cunard
and other steamship companies In stand
ing out from the Atlantic combination was
to some extent due ; to the action of the
Admiralty, as outlined by Amold-For
ester in theiHouse of Commons to-day
Tho Daily 'Mail affirms, that the agree
ment of the Atlantic shipping, combina
tion' contains secret clauses to. the effect
that the American promoters of the con
cern-intend to asik Â¦ Congress to pass a
new. shipping bill permitting foreign-built
vessels to be brought under the American
flag. Â¦ The adhesion of ; the Cunard line is
practically certain, continues the- Dally
Mail, and the - corporation will be : formed
mainly with American capital. It will
take over entire the British shipping com
panies. Those companies refusing to ioin
the combination will be compelled to fight
for their existence. For the three or four
years .that the present admiralty con
tracts have to run. the paper, adds, the
vessels will remain ;' under the Â¦ British
flag. At the expiration of this time all
will pass under the American flag and be
owned and run by Â¦ the. above-mentioned
corporation, which . will eventually en
deavor, to carry its competition to every
portion >of .the globe. - ... . Â¦Â¦*Â¦â¢

a press representative:
I cannot discuss the reports of disturbances
In Russia and the changes of the Ministry.
Jjcwever, you can eay this, that the reports
reachinic Borland are generally much exagger
ated. This criticism does not apply to all the
â¢ilspatches from St. , Petersburg. â¢ which, I be
lieve, have done much to explain to America
the true conditions in Russia. One reads here
of s&vaire charges of Cossacks upon unprotected
mob*, on whom they Inflict knocking:* and other
hardships. How mistaken Is that Impression I
know from experience. A short time ago I got
In a crowd on whom the Cossacks charged.
They cam* riding down not very fast, with
ewords not drawn, with only email riding whips
In their hands and shouting: "Please pass on!"
I saw not a elngle trace of brutality. No one
was hurt. In our country I have seen police
who had not the same consideration for more

have handled a mob more gently.

In the course of an eloquent and Impas
sioned peroration, Rawlins declared that
if the United States Government should
continue in the enforcement of its pres
ent policy in the Philippines it wouid
reap a whirlwind of misfortunes and dis
asters. . . .
Rawlins sharply criticized General Chaf
fer, and - denounced him as a "dastardly
villain, who had brought dishonor upon
the American name and the American
people." He attacked the administration
for referring to the army in the Philip
pines for investigation the charges
against the military authorities in the
islands made by Provincial Governor
Gardner. He declared that no proper in
vestigation could or â¢would be conducted
by the army, which was the object of the
criticism.
The purpose was. said Rawlins, "that
the soldiers were left to practice with im
punity and without disapproval inhuman
conduct. This is the only Intelligent and
reasonable Interpretation that'ean be put
upon it. That was the meaning ascribed
to It by the subordinate commanders, who
practiced the most inhuman conduct thaj
the mind of man can conceive."
"It strikes me." suggested Carmack.
"that General Chaffee should have said.
'I forbid inhuman conduct.' "
The explanation of General MacArthur
was not satisfactory, in the opinion of
Rawlins. The Senator's explanation was.
"Our troops are directed not to encum
ber themselves with prisoners and not to
burden themselves wan the wounded.
The Filipinos were swept from the face
of the earth. This was in explanation of
the programme to make of the Island a
howling: wilderness and to exterminate
all people over the agre of 10 years."
Rawlins quoted at length the orders is
sued by general officers inf the Philip
pines. He was interrupted by Carmack
of Tennessee, who directed particular at
tention to this phrase In one of General
Chaff ce"s orders: "I do not urge Inhu
man conduct."
Rawlins began by quoting: from the tes
timony of General Mac Arthur before the
Committee on Philippines in accounting
for the disproportion in killed and wound
ed among Filipinos. General MacArthurs
expjanation was. "It arises from the fact
that our soldiers are tranied in target
practice how to shoot. The Philippine
soldiers dÂ« not know how to shoot."
tion to the Philippine Govern
ment bill. As on previous days he de
voted much of his time to-day to a con
sideration of the testimony taken before
the Philippine committee. He analyzed
the testimony in connection with the or
ders issued by the War Department and
by general officers in the Philippines. He
vras particularly severe In his denuncia
tion of General Chaffee for the orders he
had issued in carrying: out the policy of
the Government. He Cec:ared, in conclu
sion, that the United States would reap a
whirlwind of misfortune and disaster as
a result of Its policy In the Philippine Isl
ands.

nection it may. be said that the Geary-

the Lnited Railroads, but, on the con
trary, is an independent concern.
The railway people made no attempt to
move any cars yesterday other than the
lew. which are run for the purpose of
protecting franchise rights. Two "cars
were run for the greater part of the day
en the Ellis-street line, but no business
was done. ,The cars were manned, as the
strikers claim, by some Rinkerton de
tectives. Both cars were Â«boarded by
members of the strikers' peace commit
tee and the men guarded against possible
Â«ttacks. Crowds gathered continually at
Ellis and Market streets and the motor
mer. were roundly berated by strike svm
pathizers at times. The peace committee
prevented any outbursts, however, and
the coinings and goings of the â¢cars at
length passed unnoticed. .
STRIKERS BANQUETED.
The strikers were jubilant at headquar
ters last night over the victory gained in
the Geary-street railway settlement. The
men claim that the officials of the United
Railroads will be greatly influenced by
the action of the Gerry-street company
and that the settlement of the strike will
be facilitated thereby. The employes of
the line, who are to a man members of
the Carmen's Union, were given a ban

trict last night in honor of the opening
of the line this morning. The occasion

REACH AST AGREEMENT.
The demands of the car employes were
presented by Knox and President Platt
expressed the views of his company.
"I think it was a mistake to include the
Geary-street road in your strike order,"
said Mr. Platt. Then he explained the
conditions â¢ concerning the road. and said'
that he ..was willing to , make such ar
rangements as might be mutually agreed
upon. . . . ..:Â¦:
A general discussion followed. --In a few
moments the. agreement was reached and
signed. It was agreed that the men
should return to work in the morning un
der the old conditions, pending a settle
ment of the controversy Â¦ between the
United Railroads of San Francisco and
the striking carmen. It was further stip
ulated that whatever agreement might be
later reached- between the two main con
tending parties should govern the agree
ment then made. This includes all articles
embraced in the demand presented to the
United Railroads' directors, Whatever
results may be reached at the final con 7
ference will form the basis of the agree-'
ment between the employes ot the Geary
street-road and its directors." In the event
of the increase of pay. being- granted, the
men will receive backpay from the time
they go to .work until the new orfler goes
into effect. ~ ' . â¢" Â¦ .
After the conference Chairman 1 Knox
said: .-.-...
Â¦All the employes of the road.' including
the extra men, were initiated last night
a P d immediately left for their homes in
the Richmond district, where" they were
guests of honor at a banquet tendered
them by the residents west of the ceme
teries. .
AMERICAN-BRITISH RIFLES
ENTERTAIN" AT A "SMOKER."
Â¦ The, committee of car employes at once
returned to headquarters at the Turk
street Temple and explained the details
of the arrangements made with the
Geary-street road. Knox said the basis of
the arrangement was the same as that at
present prevailing on the California and
union street lines and was eminently sat
isfactory.- He notified the men- formerly
employed on the: road to meet this even
ing to receive the obligation of the union
and then prepare to go to work in the
morning: His remarks were greeted with
great applause.
It was a mistake to include the Geary-street
road in the strike order, as we are not a part
at the United Railroads, but stand upon- the
same footing as an independent ! line, as does
the California and the Union street. . I re
ceived a telephone message this morning ask
ing If I would meet the men. ; I answered
"yes," and a delegate came down and arranged
for the meeting Just held.' We are glad the
matter has been satisfactorily arranged. Had
it rot been for this misunderstanding our road
would probably have not been tied up. Mr.
Knox Is authorized to make such statement as
he deems fit as to. the result.- . .
and are assured of better treatment. We are
to stand .upon the basin of the agreement yet
to be consummated with the United Railroads.
Mr. Platt treated us cordially and I can only
express my thankfulness for this early end
ing: of our controversy. It means- much to
the car employes -of San Francisco..
President Platt confirmed the statement
made by Mr. Knox and said:

President Cornelius stated he had heard
that certain of the strikers were going
outside of their territory, boarding cars
and using abusive language. He said :
"We do not want any abusive language,
and I want the men who are detailed Â¦ to
a certain barn, and those only, to serve
there. "We have the sympathy of the pub
lic, and we 'want to keep it, and we .can
not do it if such tactics are used. I don't
think that abuse ever won any fight, and
we are not going to use it in this one."
While no resolutions were adopted, it is
generally understood that if the Geary
street Company does not live up to its
agreement the men will be called out
again.

president Cornelius -was rather indis

rheumatism. . -. - -
A rousing meeting wa3 held. at the un

ing more than 500 present. The meeting
was opened with an address from Attor
ney J. A. Nicholson, a. brother-in-law of
Secretary James. Mr. ' Nicholson said he
was willing to offer hla services to any oC
the union men who might require them.
Following this address. President Cornel
ius Â¦ administered the obligation to more
than 200 members. These, with 200 Ini
tiated in the afternoon, bring the total
up to 1600 now initiated. It was said by
one of the officers that if the men stood
by the obligation to the union they would
be men that are men.
An Oakland delegation .was to have
come over last night, but was unable to
be present, having been notified by the
company that if they attended the San
Francisco strikers' meeting they would be
discharged. An executive committee,
however, came over to consult the strik
ers' committee. The strikers were very
much incensed at the Oakland Railway
Company's action.
Attorney Gallagher spoke to the men,
praising Mayor Schmltz'a stand on the
strike question, and the fairness with
which he was treating the laboring
classes.

MM W. the far-famed Calgary
mare, started things rolling
merrily for the talent at Oak
land yesterday, but thereafter
the going was uncertain.
Then, too, the track was in a sloppy
condition, r,-hich fact may have increased
the hazard. At any rate, the defeats of
Princess Titania and Tower of Candles
made a rent in the talent's bank roll
large enough to admit Â«>C -the passage of
a furniture moving van. Bad rides on the
part of imaginary good riders did the
rest.
The presence of May "W among' the
starters for the opening six furlong purse
run caused many owners to resort to the
scratching blank. The mare was an odds
on favorite, and though led for two-thirds
of the route by E. M. Brattain beat that
gelding with ease at the finish. .Dandy ran

Trdck Notes.
Larry Wilt has but one eye. He would
be a hard horse to beat with two good
optics.
Johnny Hoar earned decorations for
himself by placing three winners over the
plate.
â¢ "Dell" Fountain bet 'on Jingler to' show,
so that ought to silence the epitaph writ
ers on that score.
Larry Daly played in luck again. He
finished outside of the money in all four
races in which he had a mount.
"Monk" Sheehan is no longer a maiden.
He handled Varro with the ease of a
veteran. .â¢
A water spaniel belonging to a pas
senger on the 12:30 boat jumped over
board. At 2:30 a passing tugboat picked
up the almost exhausted canine.
The funeral of J. W. Langford will take
place from his late residence, 1212 Castro
street, Oakland, at 10 o'clock this morn
ing.
Green B. Morris has fully recovered
from his recent attack of illness and
viewed the racing yesterday.
Princess Titanla ran a nice race as far
as she traveled. She does not loom ud
as L a Thornton stake candidate for 1903
The Judges might have looked into the
Sea Queen race. It does appear strange
that a penciler making an extensive book
after holding out Sea Queen could lose
to the race. Still, place and show bets on
SS? 1 hÂ°m^!, l ? U8 ,?. nd Â« I!how bets on Tiburon
put him out of business.

TIME IN A SCHEDULED TWENTY-ROUND FIGHT. ' :
it looked as if her rider simply let the
mare fall asleep. Sheehan here made his
move with Varro, winning' easily by a'
length. Antolee took third place from
Flush of Gold, the only other starter.
Donnelly next paraded on the back of
Tower of Candles, the 3 to 5 favorite for
a six furlong selling affair. He exercised
the Judgment of a third rate exercise boy.
Getting all the worst of a straggling
start, he took no chance of being stood
up, but went around his field. Collared
in' the stretch by Sea Queen, he nearly
â¢fell 'off and his mount was ' unplaced. 'Sea
Queen led Saul of Tarsus out four lengths,
with Tiburon a close third.
Larry Wilt, the one carrying the smart
money, captured the last event. Frank
Woods ran second and Lena third.
Looking best of those starting in the
five and a half furlong sprint, for fillies.
Lass of Langdon won "on the bit,"""Sha
went to the -post- favorites andâ¢ couldn't
help but get home first.. Halmetta ran
second and Ishtar third." Troxler gave
St. Phmipina an apathetic ride, finishing
fifth, behind Malaspina. Â¦
Only a few days ago Varro couldn't run
in muddy going, ' yet he "won the San
Lorenzo handicap, excellently ridden by
"Monk" Sheehan. Monk does not get
many mounts, but he can outride, " shoes
to plates, many of the lads considered his
superior. Princess Titanla. with E>pnnelly
in the saddle, led for six furlongs, when
Compass, a 12 to 1 chance, with Johnny
Hoar in the saddle, downed a big bunch
cf platers in. the mile and fifty yards sell-
Ing- affair. Legal Maxim led for about
half the trip, when Compass took the lead
and in a jdrive earned the verdict by a
neck from Mamie Hildreth. Nilgar,
which closed equal choice with Mamie,
showed no speed. . . ,
PTT*^ HE second day of San Francisco
;. 1 1 Kennel Club's exhibition at Me-,
I chanics' Pavilion -was marked by a
â¢ H large attendance durfcig both the
- â¢ afternoon.' and Â¦evening'. Last
nlght,'s crowd was one of thei largest ever
seen at a dog show in this city, notwlth-
I standing the lack of' transportation facili
ties. All the dogs Judged made a splendid
showing. ,
j Consul General Ho Yow acted as judge
Â¦' of , the Pekinese dog3 and -his appearance
In the ring was the signal for a rush of
all the spectators for points; of vantage.
! The peculiar little dogs of. the Orient did
not take Â¦ kindly to the judge, resenting
for a time any attempt on his part to
- handle. them. The Cdnsul' General acquit-
I ted himself creditably in the novel role oi
! judge. ' ; ' . . . '
r Â¦ sound Of a huntsman's horn her
alded the approach of the' San Muteo
Hunt Club hounds, which have provided
such " excellent sport throughout the past
season uniler the mastership of Francis
J. Carolan. . The. hounUs carried off tne
prize for" the DÂ«st '.pack, easily defeating
â¢ tne Country Club hounds. Jerry Keating,
the - huiusi.iu.ii, clad lii the conventional
scarlet coat and hunting cap of the men
who follow the hounds, was *n charge ana
showed off the pactc to advantage. Major
J. L. Katnbone was tne judge in this com

Champion Banjo carried off the honors
In the open ciass and alao in the winners'
class. , Â¦ ; 4 '
Miss Ethel Hager's bull terrier "White
Hun won. the coveted blue ribbon In the
puppy class. Â¦
The closing event of the evening was
the trial for the best brace of dogs In
the show. The first prize was awarded
to John H. Rosseter's greyhounds, Rub
ber Ankles and May Hempstead.' This
award provoked great applause from the
large crowd and Â¦ the cheering rang
through the pavilion as the name of the
winner was announced. Mr. Rosseter has
been a consistent patron of greyhounds
for years and his victories In the show
have been popular. It was chiefly through
his efforts the greyhound section at the
exhibition is so representative.
L. A. Klein's pair of bulldogs were
placed second and Irving C. Ackerman's
fox terriers third.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the judging
for the best dog owned and exhibited in
the ring by a lady will take place.
At 5 o'clock the judging for the best dog
In the show will be held.

LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES. April 24.â The San
Francisco team to-day appeared on the
local grounds for the first time this sea
son and were. taken in by Morley's men
to the tune of 5 to 2. It really was easy
for the Seraphs, owing to the many errors
of the visitors and the . effective work of
McPartlln. Whalen pitched good ball, but
his support was ragged. Reilly had his
batting stick to-day and lined out a two
bagger and two singles. There was an
unusually big crowd for Thursday, fully
2500 enthusiasts cheering the home team
to victory. Score:

Francisco was stopped by the police in
the nineteenth roUnd, v the officers, of the
law figuring that Attel ' was on the point
of being knocked out.. ','..".'
Referee George. Siler" gave the decision
to Yanger, although Attel was still full of
fight. The affair was scheduled to go
fifteen' rounds, with the privilege to the
referee' of extending it five more rounds
in case he was not satisfied that either,
man had a distinct advantage at- the
close of the fifteenth r6und. When the
battle had progressed to the full limit the
men were on even terms, and Referee.
Siler called upon them to go the addi
tional five rounds.
Yanger's aggressiveness and terrific hit
ting power ; won him the decision, the
California boy succumbing to a storm
of blows" in the last four rounds. Attel.

Walcott opened . favorite in what little
betting was done at odds of 8 to 10. This
changed to 9 to 10 yesterday. "VÂ£ry little;
money will cause a change in odds. It.
is expected it will be even money and
take your pick before the men enter the!
ring to-night.
'/When the boxers met before . Gardner
had an injured thumb, a reminder of an.
engagement with Kid Carter, and failed
to live up to the expectations of hls>
friends. He will have no excuse to offer'
this time. He found it difficult to settle
down to the j humdrum of I training, but;
once he did so he quickly rounded Into;
condition. If appearances count for any-,
thing he is again at his best. .. ,
Walcott is fresh , from the East after
defeating Fred Russell, ..who outweighed;
him 100 pounds.- He' also met .Jack :
O'Brien, who has made a great showing,
in England. Walcott has been fighting
twelve years and : has- -never Â¦ been :
knocked out.- \ Â¦ . ">'Â¦Â¦'
Both men were particular about the'
referee, a sure indication that each:
thinks he has a chance for the long;
end of the purse. E. T. Smith. of Oak-!

proved agreeable to both lighters..- â¢â¢ " â¢â¢;

PETE DOWLINQ has Joined a
temperance club and 1b going to
be good.' To celebrate this change
of heart he met- and conquered
the Oakland sluggers yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park. Pete
had a variety of curves and speed enough
to place him In a class with the cannon
brigade. Ewing's whirlwinds could not,
touch him with telegraph poles, so Mike
Fisher was made glad with the cheerful
side of a one to nothing ending.
Dowllng and Fisher talked in whispers
to each other before leaving Sacramento
for the local battleground. Pete promised
to ride on the water wagon and go over
the bumps of the rocky road with straps
on the seat. He said he would haughtily
pass the gilded palaces where the knights

Schmidt did the brainy stunt for the
men who cross the pond, and his work
was just as fine as Dowling's, only he
was unfortunate enough to let the Sena
tors vote for three hits in the .fifth, which
gave them the lone point and the money.
The score really should have been two to
one in favor of Sacramento, but thanks
to the haughtiness of Wagner, and Gor

pillows without going through the for

mained as already quoted.
The run was scored in the fifth on
singles by Frary and Sheehan. a sacrifice
by Wagner and an infield out by Graham.
The Oaklands nearly reached the limit
on one occasion, but Schmidt was barely
caught at the pan when Mohler doubled
to left field in the sixth. The Senators
played without a spot on the error col

pretty one throughout and marked by
fast fielding and scientific work by both
teams. The score:

An interesting story comes from South Africa to

are of Irish birth, and thereupon it was discovered
that "all the commandants within a radius of sixty

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The recommendation for a water patrol has been
frequently made by the Police Department, but the
.recommendation has been always set aside as un
necessary. It seems to be the opinion that as we
have done without such a patrol in the past we can
continue to do without it. That opinion, however, is
based upon nothing except a stagnant conservatism^
The property along our miles of water front is in
creasing in value and . is entitled to , adequate pro
tection- The need for it is urgent and it should be
granted -without further delay.
In several instances of late the thieves have rowed
their boats under the wharves and from that point
of safe concealment have cut holes through the
flooring oT warehouses or stores and plundered them
while running hardly any risk at all of detection by
the patrolmen walking along the streets.
San Francisco is perhaps the only civilized seaport
of any size in the wcrld that is lacking in a com
plete outfit for, water patrol, and yet there is hardly
any city where one is more needed. The water front
of San Francisco is extensive and a large amount of
property is established along it Of late there have
been repeated evidences that thieves approaching
the wharves from the water can ply their trade with
an almost absolute impunity by reason of the fact
* that they cannot be seen by a patrol on the street
no nutter how vigilant may be his watch.
the front on water as well as on land.
While the Auditor may be right in estimating
that an increase of 100 men will be sufficient, there
can be no question that he is in error in deciding
that a patrol-boat is not necessary at this time.
There is no need of the department more urgent than
that of pioviding for an effective patrol of the water
front, and that patrol can be made effective only by
providing the police with the means of patrolling
Whether the additional 100 men allowed for will
be sufficient to bring the force up to what the needs
of the city require is for experts to decide. At the
present time the men are overworked and some of
the beats are excessively long. An increase of the
force is imperative, and in providing for it every
need of the department should be given full consid
eration. Of late crime in .San Francisco has been
altogether too frequent, and the blame for* it can
not be justly laid upon the police, for the men have
been faithful and energetic despite the long hours
and the long patrols imposed upon them.
Upon these points, and particularly the last, -Chief
of Police Wittman, a competent authority, disagrees
from the Auditor.'
AUDITOR BAEHR in his estimates for the
ensuing fiscal year just submitted to the
Board of Supervisors says: "I have allowed
the Police Department, approximately, 100 additional
patrolmen, thereby giving the now overworked men
eight-hour shifts. By this addition to the force the
city can be better patrolled and the lives and prop
erty of citizens afforded more protection. 1 have
carefully .reviewed all the needs of the department
and do not consider that the extra sergeants and
corporals and the $10,000 for a patrol-boat asked for
are available or necessary at this time."
NEEDS OF THE POLICE.
Furthermore Mr. Austin says: "In the great
currents of air and water traversing the Pacific the
conditions are especially favorable to the United
States. The fact that a great current of water and;
air flows westerly across the Pacific Ocean from'
about the mouth of the proposed isthmian canal by
way of the Hawaiian Islands to the Philippines,'
thence turning northward past the great commercial,
centers of Asiaâ^Shanghai and Yokohamaâswing
ing across the Pacific in the vicinity of the_ 'Great
Circle,',, the shortest ; route across : the* ocean, thence
down the western coast of the United States' and past
our chief Pacific Coast cities to the- very point of.be
ginning, seems to give special advantages to the com
merce between the two sections! The distance from
Brito, at the western end of the proposed Nicaraguan
canal, to Manila, following the equatorial currents of
air and water,. via the Sandwich Islands, is in round
numbers 10,000 miles; and from Manila back to
Brito, via Shanghai, Yokohama and San Francisco,
10,500 miles, thus giving to the vessels engaged Â»in
that commerce the advantages of favorable air and
water currents during the entire voyage, and prac
tically at all periods of the year."
Commercial relations between the United States
and the countries of , the Orient are bound to be
mutually profitable because we produce what ' they
need, and their products -are, mainly of a kind which
do not compete with our own. Thus it is pointed out
that in the year 1901 the importation into this country
of tropical and subtropical products amounted to
nearly $400,000,000, or almost one-half the total im
ports 1 of the United States. They consisted mainly
of such articles as raw silk, indiarubber, fibers, cab
inet and dye woods, tea, coffee, cocoa, etc. On the
other hand, those countries are importing goods
which we produce and for which we are now looking
for markets. â¢ \
. Of late years. the progress .of American trade with
China arid the Orient .genefally has been remark-,
able. Mr. Austin says: "We have made much more
rapid gains in the commerce with the Orient than
any other nation, our exports to the Orient having
grown from $40,000,000. in 1891 to $115,000,000 in
1901, an increase of 180 per cent, while the total ex
ports were increasing but 50 per .cent. Our imports
from the oriental countries increased during the same
time from $165,000,000 to $162,000,000, an increase of
over 50 per cent, while the total imports of the coun
try were increasing but, 10 per cent."
Mr. Austin began by pointing out that it is only in
the last few years the American people have turned
their attention Â¦ seriously to a consideration of for
eign commerce. The attention of our capitalists has
been' mainly occupied in the past by the construc
tion of rai^ays through the interior of the country
and .the development of the rich regions opened up
by them. Of late, however, our. production has out
run the local demand and there is now-a desire for
new markets. With the awakening of -that- desire
there has naturally come an increased attention to the
Orient.

tics, recently delivered before the Na
. â¢ tional Geographic Society at Washing
ton a lecture on the. commerce of rhe Pacific, which,
while containing nothing hew on that much .dis

COMMERCE' OF THE PACIFIC.
Maxim has just submitted to the inspection of the
British War Office a new war machine described as
"a sort of land battleship." It is a heavily armored;
car mounted .with four: guns, and;, while designed
mainly for coast defense, it is adaptable for service
in the field, and it is said "it can go anywhere." The
War Office ought to giveit a trial chasing Boers.
Such reasoning may not be very sound, but there
is enough in the situation to warn Republicans that
they cannot. afford to make blunders nor to count
upon Democratic blundering. The split in the party
on the Cuban reciprocity question, involving, as
that measure does, something of surrender of pro
tection principles, is ominous of disaster. The effort
to force the renomination of Gage is perilous so far
as this State is concerned. In short, it is time for
Republicans to take heed of what {hey are doing.
The Democrats are really uniting, and Republicans
must not divide.
In addition to the gains hoped for through Re
publican mistakes the Democrats are counting
largely upon the inevitable desire of a considerable
number of the people for a change. It is pointed out
that in the fourteen Congressional elections that
have taken place in the last twenty-eight years the
Democrats have been successful eight times and the
Republicans-six times; .that in no case has either
party carried the House in three successive elec
tions except in those that have followed since 1894.
Bryanism.pufc the .Democratic party virtually out of
the field in the East, and so' long, as '.'Bryan was the
recognized leader of the party it had no chance; but
now that he is set aside it is believed by sanguine
Democrats that the law of mutability in the public
mind will reassert itself and Democracy will win.
As a result of this movement there is an increased
activity in Democratic circles, and it is certain
Democracy is not going into' the campaign either as
a demoralized or a hopeless party. Some of their
political experts are already figuring out* the election
of a Democratic House of Representatives. It is
known that a considerable number of Republicans in
the present House were elected, by very narrow ma
jorities, and a small amount of discontent â¢ growing
out of the Cuban reciprocity treaty or some other
blunder ofthe kind on the part of Republican leaders
may bring about the defeat of several of them.
One of the significant features of the movement is
the application that has been made by Representa
tive Griggs of Georgia, chairman of the Congres
sional campaign committee, to leading Democrats. in
the East for counsel and assistance instead of turning
to Bryan and his Western Populists. Hill,- Whitney,
Olney, Lamont and men of that type have been sum
moned to the party councils, and the Bryan follow
ing has been ignored.
Having thus obtained the support^ of the South,
the Eastern. Democratic leaders and organs are rap
idly formulating a campaign on a platform of two
planks â anti-protection and anti-imperialism. The
party has no affirmative programme to offer. It
will enter the contest strictly as a party of opposi
tion. That fact, however, does not weaken its
chances. In fact, it is perhaps more dangerous . by
confining itself to opposition than it could be by at
tempting to defend an affirmative platfqrm.-
the central States."
The Washington . correspondent of, the New York
Time's says: ''The harmony movement originated in
the Seriate, which is the hotbed of the reaction
against Bryan. It is not too much to say that jhere
is not a single thick-and-thin Bryan man left in the
Senate. The harmony movement is not - the off
spring of any 'gold bugs' or 'traitors.' It proceeds
from; men who have hitherto been counted as
Bryan's strongest supporters, and they are advising
followers to ; disregard his counsels. While these
men are engineering this movement, they have no
.intention of putting the South unduly forward or
grabbing at the honors. What they want fs national
victory, first in 1902 and then in 1904. They have be
come convinced that all hopes of making important
inroads in the West are rainbows, and that to win
they must have the East' and what they can get of
REPORTS from Washington, New York and
Boston, show that the Eastern and Southern
Democrats are rapidly getting together- and
will make a formidable fight in the Congressional
elections this year,, and may possibly achieve suc
cesses that will render them even more formidable
in the Presidential contest of 1904. The movement is
in the direction of free trade, and it is quite probable
the country may have to undergo the disturbing agi
tations of another fight on the protective system un
der which our industries have been built up.

OF LETTERS
Opinions, of publishers, like Â«Â«Â»J^Â£
doctors, differ sometimes. I to â¢ *gl a< 2
mentioned 'how timorous a P uW!s JÂ« "
about launching forth to any erenttxttM
until after the coronation cÂ« erQ Â°";. e r 3 '
but Grant Richards expi esses his 'enure
disbelief in the theory that the coronation
will prejudicially affect the book trade.
He believes the only reason tnere . can Â°Â®
for a smaller output of books this year
than in previous .years is that authors are
not writing books. Publishers feel justi
fied in risking their money In publishing
but naturally no books will be issued just
at coronation time. Afterward, however,
there Is tho probability of an early be
ginning of the holiday season, which w
always a good time for the sale of books.
The chief Interest has. I think, centered
among, the reading public during the last
few days in the announcement of Messrs.
Methuen, of their being about to publish
another romance by Marie Corelll. At
any rate, they say the manuscript will
be In their hands some time in May. and
the book will be out some time during the
summer. It will be remembered tHat the
"Master Christian." Miss Corelli'a last
book of importance, was published al
most two years ago, but what is now
puzzling people very much is the an
nouncement by the publishers that the
new book "deals with a subject which
has never been treated In fiction, and
ultimately touches certain points which
for some time have been uppermost !n
the minds of many people." *Â£"'*'*
What can this be? is the question. It
is certainly a hard one to answer.
The war in South Africa, the increased
income tax. the Japanese alliance, plng
pong. are all topics which have been up
permost in most minds, but they have all
bten more or leas dealt with in. fiction,
the last named especially. There is no
end to fiction about it. Now. as Misa
CorelU is so good in keeping a secret, the
public will probably have to possess their
souls in patience till the date of publica

There Is quite a thrill at the mere pos
sibility of a hitherto unknown work by
John Milton coming t<aflftlght. This possi
bility certainly applies .to a book which
Murray Is to publish In the autumn. It
is an anonymous romance In prose and
verse, written in the time of Charles I.
It is therefore contemporary with Milton,
and the internal s evidence of Its being
written by him la Bald to be remarkable.
It is to the credit of a London non
conformist minister, the Rev. Walter
Begley, to make this literary find. He
came upon it in an ancient tome where It
appears to have lain undiscovered for so
long. After a full study of the work and
all the circumstances bearing upon it he
feels entitled to attribute it. "until fur
ther evidence, to the illustrious John Mil
ton." The romance has the long title,
"Nova Solyma, the Ideal City of Zlon; or,
Jerusalem Regained."
H. B. Irving, who In the . intervals of
acting, has written a book on Judge Jeff

Fire Commissioner Hecht appeared be
fore the Supervisors' Fire Committee yes
terday and submitted a report of his ob
servations of salt water auxiliary systems
successfully used in the East for fire pro
tection. After hearing Commissioner
Hecht's explanation the committee re
quested that the Fire Commissioners des
ignate a district in which mains shall be
laid for the purpose and thereupon the
city engineer will be directed to prepare
plans and estimates for the auxiliary sys

be incorporated in the bond issue. Â¦
' Commissioner Hecht . took occasion to
tell - of the . difficulties under which his
commission had been laboring owing to
the refusal of the Spring. Valley Company
to supply water necessary for nre-flghting
purposes. Hecht said . that at nearly
every meeting, of the commission held
during the last two years some request
had been made of the water company, but
all had been either refused or ignored.
Assistant Chief Engineer Forbes of the
company denied that any promises had
been made or violated.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 24.â While
Balascheff, the man who assassinated the
Minister of the Interior, M. SIpiaguine,
April 14, was recalcitrant throughout the
preliminary examination, his testimony
developed the significant fact that the as
sassin had in his pocket a sealed envelope
addressed to M. Pobiedonostaef, the chief
procurator of the holy synod. It is in
ferred from the finding of this envelope
that had M. Pobiedonostaef carried out
his purpose of going to the ministerial
offices April 14, the day that SIpiaguine
was assassinated, he would have been
killed instead of the Minister of the In
terior. The discovery of this envelope is
considered confirmation I of the theory
that a conspiracy against several Rus
sian officials existed.

and whether the Government would~ap
point a committee to inquire into the sub
ject, said the Government did not â¢ think
that the subject at present was ripe
for the kind of inquiry suggested.
Growth of Trusts in England.
After considerable discussion a vote was
taken and the license, which has hereto
fore been $300 per quarter, was increased
to $500 per quarter. The desire of some
of the taxpayers of Sausallto to raise tho
license to $1500 per quarter, -which wish
was granted by the old board of Trustees,
but reconsidered at the last council meet
ing by the Incoming board, did not meet
with the approval of the members to
day. In the matter of who should be
licensed to run the games Harvey and
Daroux were the only ones receiving per
mits.
SAUSALITO, April 24.â The City Trus

The steamer cruised past Port Costa and
Benicia and back-.out of the straits and
up to Mare Island, and an hour was spent
seeing the sights at the navy yard. Gar

charge of the excursion arrangements.
The members of the *local association
busied themselves in seeing that their
guests, the visiting delegates to the State

The steamer left the Mission-street pier
at shortly after half past 9 o'clock. Three
hundred and sixteen passengers were on
the boat, not counting the musicians,
who played national airs and ragtime till
they were permanently red in the face.
The vessel steered southward along the
water front, out past the Union Iron
Works and the Blsdon Iron Works and
then back and along the front, giving the
visitors a complete view of the shipping
in the harbor. The course was then laid
past Alcatraz and Angel Island. Mare
Island navy-yard was the objective point.
The Master Plumbers ended their con

In the campaign of 189S Gage and the
Republican State Central Committee for
good and sufficient reasons did not per
ml . t , , Gos P er to take an active part in
political affairs. Major Frank McLaugh
lln and Frank P. Flint, survivors w of that
campaign, might be able to explain why
Gosper was not sent to the front.
The smooth and saintly Gosper of Lo<=
Angeles Is doing missionary work for
Gage in Southern California. He does it
In apologetic style. Gosper, In addressing
the wanderer from the Gage fold says-
It is not right to charge Gage with the
offense of associating with Dan Burns
It is true that the Governor at one tim~
recognized that he was under political
obligations to Burns, but the political
debt has been fully paid and the Gover
nor is now perfectly independent of
Burns."

All the factions are keeping out of the

At this time there is a deal of trouble
In the Gage camp. There is lack of har

gramme to swing all the existing State
officeholders into line for renomination
has been revised. All of the State officers
of the existing regime, excepting Lieu

to help C. F. Curry in the latter's fight

â¢ The Sheriff and Detective Fisher of Sac
ramento confronted Wardrlp with the
other prisoner and with Carl Dalbert, who
gave the first information to the authori
ties. Wardrip finally weakened and ad
mitted the truth of the., stories. He de
clared he was ready to go back to Sac
ramento and take his punishment. Sheriff
Naylor, Detective Fisherand Dalbert left
shortly before midnight with .Wardrip for
Sacramento. : , â¢ ,:
Wardrip asked his fellow-prisoner to
come to California as soon as released to
help prove an alibi. The confidant of the
murderer promptly told Sheriff Naylor.
Ho then told how he had committed the
crime. He and a boy. hestated, had bro
ken into a house In Sacramento to com
mit burglary. The boy remained on the
outside to watch while Wardrlp went
through the house. Duffey, a neighbor,
came up, according: to Wardrip, and seized
the boy on the outside. Wardrip says he
found a revolver lying on a table in - the
house. Hearing the struggle outside, he
picked up the weapon, went to the win
dow and lired, killing Duffey. The two
criminals then escaped.
SALT LAKE, April 24-Just 'before

night to . face the charge of murdering
Hugh Duffey In Sacramento, Frank War

that he was. guilty. The confession was
first obtained through a ruse. Sheriff Nay

a "stool pigeon," who gained Wardrip's
confidence during the day. Wardrlp, who
was arrested under. the name of Wade,
confided that he was guilty of the crime
laid against him, and begged his fellow
prisoner to help him. He stated his real
name was Wardrlp, and that his father,
David Wardrlp, and his sister, Miss Nellie

"What with â¢ the Sykes Indebtedness and
the $5000 damage talk of Attorney Prosek
the ladies declare that they have been al
most beside themselves. !$$8Â£$2S
Then Attorney . Prosek goes on to ad
vise Mrs. Swales that should she not get
judgment, which he declares is "utterly
impossible," it would put them in a "very
ugly position." Attorney-at-Law Prosek
tells Mrs. Swales, in concluding his letter
In behalf of his client, that before taking
the step she should consider the matter
thoroughly, -as- it could only result in a
loss to hereof thousands of dollars. , Mr.
Prosek concludes his advice as follows:
"I have advised Mr. S. (Sykes) that if
"you should go to the board to-morrow it
will be three years before you get-an
other cent, taking for granted that -you
Â§et a judgment, which is utterly, impossl
le.". .Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦.- u< ....'.....Â¦'.Â¦; .-.; {.
On March 4, 1902, a letter signed John
Prosek, attorney-at-Iaw, San Francisco,
was received by Mrs. Swales, in which
the, attorney, on behalf of Sykes, warns
Mrs. Swales that here going before the
Board, of Education would be construed
as an attempt to injure Mr. Sykes'. char
acter, by slander. Mr. Prosek also de
mands from "Mrs. Swales the sum of
$5000 for slander committed against said
Sykes in this city and county"; also the
sum of $290 for legal services performed
by Mr. Sykes, who practices as an attor
ney Independently of his position in the
School Department; i
Attorney-at-Law Prosek also asks In
his letter if Mrs. Swales has any idea as
to what the suit she threatened would
cost, and attempted to dissuade her from
carrying out her determination by telling
her that he and his client would, of
course, insist on a jury trial, which
would cost her $35 a day in advance,
which expenditure would go on for many
many days. Â¦ .'
Attorney Prosek continues and warns
Mrs. Swales that. he will take the case to
the Supreme Court, should he not secure
justice for Mr. Sykes elsewhere,, and re
minds the lady that, such an act on his
part would put the matter off ; for three
years. "You will have to pay many times
$200 for attorney's fees alone," he adds. .
Both Mrs. and Miss Swales declare they
haves been living in dread and misery
through letters which have been written
and threats made by Sykes. "
"He replied:' 'I won't ' pay a damned
cent.' Whereupon I Â¦ warned him that I
would go to the Board of Education and
complain. â¢ Sykes said : ; Â¦ 'I'll make it - so
hot I'll run you out of town.' I replied:
â¢All right, Jim. I'll fight to the bitter
end.'. However, he consented to pay back
the money at $20 a month and for sev
eral months he did so, in small amounts,
aggregating In all $203, leaving a balance
of $261, with interest amounting to about
$43. His payment* ( stopped, . and as
Christmas was near at hand my mother
made a request for | the continuance of
the Installments and received an eccentric
and altogether unsatisfactory reply."
"I received that letter on the date it
was written," said Miss Swales, "and,
fearing from the wording of the epistle,
that he meant to commit suicide I loaned
him $100 more. In January, 1901, I wrote
him, telling; him his note for $125 was
about to mature and I extended. the time
for one year and eight months. The
same night he received a note for $400.
On February 26, 1901, I met him with a
lady. .He Introduced her as his wife, and
I asked him. later why he came to my
mother's house posing as a single man.
Ke had been paying â¢ honorable attention
to me. I told him I wanted nothing more
to say to him and requested him. to pay
me the money he had borrowed from me.
This is the Rubicon, and ,if I can pass It
there'll be no more trouble as business will
keep me occupied, arid' that's my salvation.

you can help me do no, as something awful

Miss Swales says she acceded to the re
quest and readily handed Sykes the $125.
Then another application for money
came in the following letter:
July 21. 1900.
The rather remarkable letters ( were sub
mitted, to the Board of Education as a
corroboration of the charges, and Mrs.
Swales further adds that she laid before

Swales: ' .'Â¦ i
SAN FRANCISCO, June 28, 1900.
Dear Lilyâ As you suggested, I spoke to my
mother about that money and there was a ter

It would be impossible to raise the money.

Miss Swales declares that in reply -.to
Sykes' requests she handed to him on sev

$465, the result of three years', savings
when acting as bookkeeper in the city.
Both Mrs. Swales and . her daughter
â¢were greatly disturbed yesterday over the
allegation: that they were attempting to
blackmail Sykes, and to refute so -grave
an accusation they produced the original
letters sent them by Sykes In which' he
asks for loans of money, which were ac

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Eroadway, April, 24.
Borne down by grief over the death a
short time ago of her husband, and hope
less because of the knowledge that she
could not stay the ravages of dread con
sumption, Mrs. Rosalie Taylor died to
day at 1903 Telegraph avenue, having for
months refused to place-herself under the
care of a physician. .
"It will be useless," said the unhappy
woman, "and I can only wait patiently
for the inevitable, which must soon
call me." . .
Because of Mrs. Taylor's unyielding op
position to a physician's care, there was
none who could lawfully sign the death
certificate, which the statutes demand.
Therefore Coroner Mehrmann was called
upon to take charge of the case. There
will be a formal inquiry, in order that the
requirements of the law shall be met.
Pathetic indeed is the story of this
wojnan. . Only a year and a half ago she
was married to John Taylor, a young
Santa Cruzan, who settled in Oakland
and engaged in mercantile work on the
other side of the bay. His last engage
ment was with the Emporium in San
Francisco. Shortly after that consump
tion attacked him. For months the young
bride nursed her husband, but the prog
ress of the disease could not be stayed,
and before long he was borne to the
grave.
Worn by constant watching and worry,
Mrs. Taylor was an easy victim for the
germs. Soon after her husband had
been laid away the wife knew that she
was In the grip of the fatal malady. She
tried to support herself by dressmaking,
but was compelled to desist,. her strength
being, insufficient. ' Then Â¦ the young
woman went to the home of Mr. and Mrs.
C K: Marshall, where she breathed, her
last to-day; -'*--.â¢Â¦:-â¢â--...'.- T
From the . very beginning ilra. , Taylor
persisted in. the stand that the doctors
might only prolongher suffering.- There
fore she resigned herself to the situation
and was ready for the end when It came.
Mrs. Taylor was 28 years old and a na
tive of San Francisco.

City Attorney Maihews made a power
ful argument on the theory that the
franchises offered for sale were not piich
as the law gives to the city authority
to cell, for the reason that they con
tained unusual privilege^
T. E. Gibbon, .attorney if orÂ« the -Tra>>
non company, read many cases in sup
pori of tbÂ« proposition that the bid of
the Pacific Electric Company could not
feu accepted by the Council: that the
lime for open bids had passed and the
Council acted arbitrarily.
The argument will be concluded to
rrorrow. when the complainants' attor
neys will take up their s!d<? of the case.
McEnerney sounded the keynote of the
opposition to the proceedings and raised
a point of gTeat importance to Lo3- An
geles, viz.. that the Broughton law is not
in force in this city. It was his conten
tion that the people cf Los Angeles,
ihrcugh the freeholders' charter, had
gained the right to sole self-government
in strictly municipal affairs and that the
Legislature cannot takf away this right
or assume control of the city's internal
business by the enactment of a general
?aw such as the Broughton act. As the
cuy charter provides for the rontrol of
ihe public streets by the Council an'l its
power to sell and otherwise dispose of
Mreet railway franchises, McEnerr.ey
held to the position that this righ- of
home rule was fixed when the Legisla
ture approved of the freenolders' charter
and that the constitution insured a- con
tinuance of this right, free from any act
of the State iawmaking body. -
This attack on the Broughton act was
in answer to the contention of the Pa
cific Electric Company that the ordinance
r.v which tlie Council granted the fran
chises was valid and binding on the city
rnder that act without the signature of
the Mayor, while three-fourths of the
Council is necessary under the charter
provisions.

Company are Judge J. S> Chapman, Blck-

'i ho mas & Halslead, byrcn L. Oliver and
P. R. Wilson. Garret McEnerney made
the opening argument for the Clark-Hook
side.
The purchase yrice was tendered back
to the Pacific Electric Company, and was
setused. As the Council notified the com
pany that an attempt to buiM under the
irar.chises would be met with all the
lorces at the city's command, the com
];&ny comirericed the present action to
procure an Injunction against tne city,

tion. .

The Bowens have .been married since
1S75. They have nine children, the. eldest
of whom is 28 years of age and the young
est 9. .
Until three, years ago Mr. Bowen re
sided with his family in Alameda, but
after the acts complained of by the wife
h& began to live in San Francisco. He
remitted $323 a month for the support of
his family, but recently cut off thi3 al
lowance. Mrs. Bowen says he is well able
to continue the payments and she wants
the court to compel him to pay her a
regular stipend. His business is worth
$150,000. she thinks, and his income $1000
a month.
Margaret A. Magors was granted a
alvorce to-day by Judge Greene from J.
W. Magors on the ground of desertion.
She says she married him in 1S93 on the
advice of a friend, but that when she
went to live on her husband's ranch ! in
Oregon she found it so unlike , anything
she had been accustomed to that she ran
away from her husband. He did not con
test the suit. Â¦ ...
At various other times the wine mer
chaint is alleged to have cursed his wife
without provocatlqn and in the presence
of the children and guests. of the family.
All these overt acts took place at . tha
home of the Bowens in Alameda. Â¦
The wife, whose name is Margaret B.
Bowen, filed her suit to-day. She names
cruelty and desertion as the basis for h-or
action. She complains that lately her
husband's conduct toward her has be
come intolerable. On February 13, 1SS9.
she charges, he struck her in the face
with his clenched fist. Her children, who
witnessed the assault, were called upon
to rescue her from their father's frenzy.
The alleged disposition of Charles E.
Bowen, senior member of the firm of
Wetmore, Bowen & Co*, wlner merchants
of San Francisco, to use his. fists upon
his wife- whenever things did not go tha
way to suit him has induced that .wife
to seek relief from further trouble wlin
him by applying for a divorce.

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND.
THE GREAT DELIVERER FROM
DISEASE AND SUFFERING.
Paine's Celery Compound
Full of Life-Griving Power
and Virtue Is the Pre-
scription of a Great
Physician.
It Has No Equal as a
Spring Medicine.
It should be "well understood by the ail-
ing, physically broken down and diseased
that ihe ordinary advertised nervines,
I sarsaparillas, tonics and pills have never
J accomplished . the glorious life-saving
! -work in springtime that has marked the
I history of that health-giver, Palne'a Cel-
ery Compound, which has cured such des-
perate cases of kidney disease, liver com-
plaint, rheumatism, neuralgia, dyspepsia
and blood diseases.
Paine's Celery Compound Is the discov-
ery of one of the ablest physicians that
ever lived, and one of the strongest
proofs of Its worth and value Is the fact
I that able practitioners prescribe and rec-
| ommend it dally.
t If Is this Paine's Celery Compound, dear
I sufferer. t.hÂ« cTÂ«at nÂ«rve fÂ«e<1Â«r. the mar-
j velous system cleanser and digestive reg-
ulator, that we now strongly urge you to
make use of at this season If you lack
the strength of true manhood or woman-
hood. The young and old. the rich and
poor extol Its wondrous effects. Try Its
â¢ curative virtues without delay If you
would be free from your ailments and en-
; joy life. A bottle or two used Just now
; will cause you to bless heaven that such
i a life-giver was placed before suffering
: humanity.

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, AprTlT-The important in
fluence of the craln crop prospects upon the
etock market was again demonstrated to-day
After a strong opening prices wavered and
commenced to eo back when the weather man
was published showing almost no rain east of
the Rocky Mountains, but when the wheat
markets opened and revealed an active liquida
tion at declining prices stocks promptly began
to pick up again. The persistent sagging of
the price of wheat was accompanied by grow
ing and broadening strength in stocks, with
the notable demand centered on the 'grain
carrying railroads. Report* from the *ra1n
market attributed the weakness there entirely
to realizing of profits on over-extended Ion*
accounts as no news was forthcoming to In
dicate a better condition In the crop. Naturally
the covering demand from the gnort Interest
.in gtocka which has accumulated on the week's
â¢ decline also played a considerable part In the
vneculative movement. But the day's events
rÂ»re a etrlKing evidence of the intimate asnocU
f tlon at present between the erain jnarkeu and
the securities market. The quick response be
j tween the two is emphasised by the general
[ conviction that the present strong leadership

Indiana, Minnesota, Nineteenth, Twen

Property-owners complained that the

been improperly done, but the board found
that the sewer was properly constructed

Wants California Goods Purchased.
The Manufacturers' and Prodr rs' As
sociation has directed the attent' n of the
Board of Supervisors to section SJ47 of the
Political Code, requiring perference to be
given to California products in the pur
chasing of supplies by State, county, city
and town boards, commissions and of
ficers, price, quality and fitness permit
ting. The asociation asks the board's co
operation toward seeing that the law Is
complied with, including the giving qf dua
notice in advertisements that such prefer
ence will be given. .
Third Street Obstructions.
Theodore and Warren Payne filed a pro
test yesterday with the Board of Super
visors . against granting the petition of
the Harbor Commission to rescind that
portion of the resolution ordering the re
moval of obstructions at the foot of Third
street.- so far as it applies to Bender Bros.
The protestants represent that while the
firm named is Tenting property under the
jurisdiction of the Harbor Commission,
its buildings also encroach on the public
street and should be removed so as to af
ford access to private property.

bull news In wheat â cables were strong re
ceipts Bmall, clearances large and cooler
weather paragraphs came in abundance. Profit
selling started early, which eased the market
somewhat, but when the rain reports from
Kansas arrived selling was general. The out

Sentiment in corn was changed somewhat on
general news. Offerings were larger, the South

WHEAT â The foreicn markets showed little
change.
The weather continued the sole feature In
the Chicago market,, which .was active and un
settled at a decline of l%c, owing to scattered
but continuous, rains over the Southewest, with
possible showers predicted for to-day. These
rains, while light, are sufficiently numerous
and contluuous to break the market, though
they were partially offset yesterday by general
frosts in the Central West and killing frosts
in Ohio. There was a big trade at the decline,
and though strong parties bought at the open
ing the market could not immediately absorb
the enormous selling. Southwest, led by
St. Louis, were heavy sellers, then - turned
equally heavy buyers. Kansas City bought
back all the wheat sold early. Minneapolis.
raported that stocks there would decrease 000,
000 bushels for the week.
. This market sympathized with Chicago and
declined on call, but shipping grades remained
unchanged. Freights were firmer, a ship being

annual report of the Lake Shore Railroad was
a palpable influence on all of the Vanderbilts
and Indirectly on the whole railroad list on
account of the enormous earning power re
vealed and the prosperous traffic conditions.
The disclosure of the purchase by the Lake
Shore of a large block of Lehigh Valley stock
and admissions on the part of the principal
banklnc houses interested In the coalers that
purchases of Readinc were being made by
New York Central, Pennsylvania and the
Goulds were taken as corroboration of the ex
tensive community of interest being established
in the whole coal transportation Industry- New
York Central recovered strongly, 2*i from its
recent depression. Lake Shore itÂ«elf and Mich
igan Central, owing to the. small floating sup
ply outside the New York Central treasury,
rose 13 and 19"> respectively on a very slight
demand. United States Steel stock* shared
in the strength of the market for the first time
!n many wÂ«>ks. rising IVi on eecount of the
very active transactions In the trade. Atten
tion was called to-<Jay to the enormous ex
pansion of plant in progress, which, accord
lnK to one authority, will add at least 5000
tor.s daily to the pis iron product. Front one
point of view this is cited as evidence of the
confidence of continued prosperity in the trade,
as the?e enlarcemcnts will not come into full
production for a year or a year and a half.
The money market continued easy, with evi
dence of continued recuperation from the bank

CROOKS CAPTURED ( BY iPO
LJCEMAN H. P. BRAIG. - i
All the prisoners were placed In the
tanks and their names recorded â¢ on the
detinue book. They were given no op
portunity to converse with one another,
and yesterday morning their records
â¢were revealed. Â¦ .
'-"Braig- immediately identified -Hamilton
as the man with whom Judge Fritz had
the experience last month, - despite the
fact that the. crook had shorn himself of
his mustache. Hamilton, when- arrested,
was equipped with a unique disguise. In
his pockets wero found a soft, white hat
and a false jersey front, which, when
slipped over a white shirt and collar, al
ters the man's appearance entirely.
"When brought before Judge Fritz yester
day Hamilton displayed his discomfiture
and did - not recover -his composure for
.some time. Hamilton denies. that he is
guilty of this crime, but Judge Fritz is
sure he is. .
Chief of Police Wittman praises Bralg's
good work.
"It was one of the most ' remarkable
pieces of detective work accomplished in
some time," he said. "I cannot say too
much in favor of this officer's cool Judg
ment and penetration displayed during
the entire proceeding. I shall. take steps
very soon to make manifest to Patrolman
Braig my appreciation."
Braig' himself Is modest in accepting
the praise due him. He only rejoices that
he was able to capture the bevy of crim
inals. Braig has always been regarded
as one- of the most efficient policemen in
the department. A short time ago he was
assigned to duty on Powell street, which
is one of the most important beats in the
city.
Prisoners in the Tanks.
Again Braig showed his sagacity. In
stead of leaving the premises Im
mediately he caused a guard to
be stationed in . the neighborhood
and' four officers under. Sergeant Duke
performed this service. This wise pre
caution resulted in . the capture of
Thomas Barker shortly afterward. Bar
ker, attired in his nlghtrobe, had con
cealed himself in an adjoining room be
hind a gas meter. He was arrested, and
followed his companions to jail. Â¦*
Braig ble-w his -whistle, placing his
brother officers on the alert. Suddenly a
man leaped from a window and ran into
Bralg's arms. This was Hamilton. He
was handcuffed, and then Joe King was
taken. The arrest of the two women
was an easy matter. The room was then
searched and the loot of many crlme3
discovered. .
George Caldarella was tried before a
jury In Judge Dunne's court yesterday on
the charge of - assault to murder for
shooting- his uncle. Philip Caldarella. at
Third and Tehama streets on November
14. The jury, brought in a verdict of sim
ple assault. .

Mr. Collins argued also that the prose
cution had been built up on circumstan
tial evidence solely and that no conviction
should or could be had on such evidence
unless the theory deduced from it should
be totally inconsistent" with the theory
of the defendant's innocence. The fact
that witnesses had testified that the ac
cused had a good reputation should b*
taken as an offset against any theory of
guilt. The Supreme Court of the State. In
the case of the People vs. Hurley (Six
tieth .California), had decided that the evi
dence of the good reputation of thÂ« de
fendant should have been accepted as
strong evidence in favor of the innocenc*
of Hurley, who was charged with being
in possession of stolen property, "al
though,", added Mr. Collins, with a sly
glance at Secret Service Agent Burns,
"this case has not got to that point yet."
Mr.' Collins concluded his argument at
4:30 o'clock in the afternoon and Judge de
Haven adjourned the court until 10 o'clock
this morning, at which hour S. C. Den
son of the- firm of Denson & Schlesinger.
special counsel for . the Government, will
make the closing argument for the prose
cution. -j: Â¦
Mr. Collins pointed out^that it had been
testified that when Cole was sick at home
Superintendent Leach and Dimmick tried
to open the vault. on Cole's combination,
but they were unable . to do so, because
Mr. " Cole," in Â» the sealed ' memorandum of
the combination, had omitted one turn of
the knob. So that, instead of there being
proof Â¦ that Â¦ Dimmick knew Cole's . combi
nation on the coin .vault, there was proof
that he did\not know it, and therefore
could not have stolen the money. -
â¢ Leach and Cole controlled the two posi
tions that gave them free access to the
vault.' Mr. Washington had access also,
and Mr. Kitzpatrick was employed to
watch the vault, "and you know how well
he watched it." added Mr. Collins ironi
cally. "The wonder is that millions did
not disappear instead of >30,000." .
Then Mr. Collins praised Dimmick as
an industrious man, who was not satis
fied- to work six or eight hour per day,
but burned the midnight gas and
electric lights in the Mint in doing
extra work for the Government and Mr.
Leach and for which he was to receive no
extra pay. The counsel followed this up
by asking the business men on the jury to
believe that Dimmick had been selected
by a gang of conspiring thieves as the
victim, because he was so industrious as
to work over hours without pay.
. The counsel followed this up by insin
uating that Superintendent Leach- and
Cashier Cole were members of a con
spiracy for the purpose of convicting Dim
mick of the larceny of $30,000. The asser
tion was madÂ© also that- Cyrus P. Ellis
and other witnesses for the Government
had .testified to falsehoods and in pursu
ance of the conspiracy spoken of.'
evidence Circumstantial. , >
Fail to ; Open Vault.
| W\th reference to the contention of the
Government that because Dlmmick's com
bination arid that. of Cole, who succeeded
him as cashier, were alike as to one or
two numbers, Dimmick was able to open
the vault and steal the money.
-George D." Collins, i in resuming his argu
ment in the' United States District Court
yesterday morning in the case of the
Unitsd States vs. Walter N. Dimmick,
proceeded to quote from Sergeant Ballen
tyne and other famous British Jurists to
show that" policemen,- detectives and
secret service agents always proceeded on
the assumption of the guilt of the sus
pected person, and, that because of this
bias brought about by professional pride
and a desire to prove the truth of his
theory, the detective often unconsciously
colored his statements to the detriment of
the accused. : He.' added , that he would
not say that United States Secret Ser
vice Agent Burns had committed per
jury, , but he would say that Burns had
misstated the facts when he gave his tes
timony with regard^ to the confidential
conversation between. himself, and Dim
mick, and fortunately the truth of . the
matter was brought out by Mr. Chicker-
Ing. a gentleman of unblemished integ
rity, who .testified that Dimmick . had
made no admission at all of guilt.

The quartet started onward at a brisk
pace and Braig trailed them Â¦ to Tehama

entered the . rear of - a ( building . which
fronts on 835 : Howard . street. The officer
made a hasty examination of the i prem

not attempting an arrest at that time.

assistance and stationed them "at all doors

Brings Suit Against Milo
Gillett to Recover
Property. .
Startling Similarity of Initials
Increases the Suspicion
Against Him.
Salmon died intestate in October, 1898,
and his widow, who was named adminis
tratrix, announced that his estate was
worth only $2000 and consisted solely of an
interest in a ranch in Napa County. She
married Gillett in November, 1899, and in
April. 1901. when she died, she left him
ail her property.
It now transpires that Mrs. Gillett never
closed up the affairs of the estate of her
first husband and an Investigation was
commenced by Will S. and Beatty Salmon,
sons of Joseph Salmon by a previous mar
riage. They petitioned the Superior Court
lor the appointment of Charles C. God
dard as administrator of their father's
estate and Goddard continued the inves
tigation, with the result that he yester
day filed a suit to recover from Gillett
$56.556 66. which he alleges was fraudu
lently concealed by Salmon's widow.
According to Goddard's complaint. Sal
mon left personal property worth. $24,656
and a Jot on Ellis and Mason street, which
his widow in her capacity as administra
trix did not account for and . which she
Â¦willfully and with intent to defraud the
natural heirs concealed and converted to
her own use. Under the law Salmon's
two eons are entitled to one-half of their
fathers' estate.
Charles H. Goddard, who was recently
appointed administrator of the estate of
Joseph Salmon, filed a sensational suit
yesterday against MIlo J. Gillett, execu
tor of the estate of his late wife, Lucella
R. Gillett. who, before she became Mrs.

TO BE MUCH REDUCED
I Chief of Detectives John Seymour is re
doubling his efforts to get some trace of
Charles B. Hadley, the missing Examiner
accountant, who is wanted in connection
with the mysterious murder of Nora Ful
ler. While neither Chief Wittman nor
Captain Seymour will say positively that
Charles B. Hadley is the man who com
mitted the murder, it is quite evident
from the pressing inquiry they are mak
ing into the habits and affairs of the
missing man that they believe that when
they locate him the police will have ac
complished a stroke which may result in
much light being shed on the mystery.
Chief Wittman has communicated with
the police of nearly all the large cities
admonishing them to be on the lookout
for Hadley. If he is located he will be
brought back to explain away many pecu
liar links of circumstantial evidence and
perhaps some strong positive evidence
which cloud his name with suspicion. In
addition to the Btatement of Salesman
B. Vi Schell. who says that the picture of
Hadley with the false mustache is identi
cal with his recollection of his mysterious
customer, there is the positive statement
of Handwriting Expert Kytka to the ef
fect that Chanes B. Hadiey is the man
who wrote the advertisements printed in
the Examiner and Chronicle and who
signed also the rental contract for the
house on Sutter street in which the mur
der was committed.
Kytka Is preparing other exemplars of
Haaley's handwriting, which he says
make It more apparent to . the layman
that his belief is correct. The initials
C B H which the nlurderer wrote on the
mattress when he pVirchased it and the
initials C B H which Hadley often wrote,
samples of which have been compared,
are exactly similar. It does not take a
handwriting expert to see the similarity.
Any bank cashier or other person used
to paying out money on written signa
tures would not hesitate to honor either
of the two initials and acknowledge them
to have been written by the same man.
,r instance, if Hadley had signed an
or -sr for money or goods, using simply
his initials C B H, and It were presented
to somebody who was in the habit of
doing business with him. they would un
questionably have honored either signa
ture, the one known to have been written
by Hadley or the one hastily scribbled on
the mattress by the man who murdered
Nora Fuller.
On the subject of the handwriting
neither Chief Wittman nor Captain Sey
mour will say anything more definite than
that- they have the most implicit confi
dence in Kytka's ability and honesty.
This is practically an admission that they
believe that Charles B. Hadley, the miss
ing Examiner accountant, is the man who
wrote the Initials on the. mattress and the
man who rented the house where the
young girl was subsequently strangled.
The police hope that the publicity given
the case will soon result in the discovery
?f somebody who has seen Hadley since
he. left the city on the day after Nora
Fuller's body was found. In this way
they hope to get a clew to his present
whereabouts.
Another Picture of Hadley.
VICTORIA, B. C. April 24.â Five years
asro C. B. Hadley, accountant of the Ex
aminer, who is wanted on suspicion of the
Nora Fuller murder, was in Victoria and
he sat for some photos in Savannah's gal
lery in this city. The San Francisco po
lice were informed of this fact and to
day Savannah received a telegram from
Chief Wiy:man asking him to forward
copies of the photograph which Hadley
had taken here. Savannah has the neg
ative and will dispatch copies of the pic
tures to San Francisco without delay.

The manner in which Braig landed the
gang is told in a report that reads like
a romance. Braig is detailed on Powell
street, and shortly Â¦ before 8 o'clock
Wednesday night was called to 208 Powell
street by Mrs. A. Murphy, > who claimed
that her room had been robbed of cloth
ing â¢ during her absence earlier . in the
evening. Braig discussed the ; robbery
with the woman, and while doing, so ob
served a man enter from the street and
pass upstairs. The officer followed the
man, inquiring 1 his business/ The stranger
replied that he wished furnished rooms,

Thomas Barker, another prisoner, -was
sentenced from San Bernardino County to
San Quentin for elx years. He was com
mitted on January 18, 1896, and was dis
charged March 18, 19W. In the.party.ar
rested were also Mrs. Annie Barker, the
wife of Thomas Barker, and Kittle
Nehill, alias Carrie Perry, Mrs. Barker's
sister. Neither of the women is known
to have been charged with any crime.
The gang was tanen by Officer Braig in
a builalng at 835 Howard street. In ef
fecting the capture Braig was assisted by
Policemen Tnomas Murphy, -William
Eskew and Charles Staples, whom he
called to his assistance after he had
tracked the robbers to their headquarters.
Nearly a carload of stolen property was
recovered. Musical instruments, weapons,
trunks, clothing and household goods of
all descriptions were included in the
plunder. Officer Braig is at present at
tempting to locate the owners of the
stolen property, but it, is expected that
confessions of the thieves will reveal the
ownership. â¢.,

A CLEVER piece of detective
work was accomplished Wednes
day night by Policeman Harry
P. Braig. By shrewd work the
officer landed as notorious a gang
of criminals as has been placed be
hind the bars in some time. Â¦ One
of the men taken in the raid was Harry
Hamilton, identified by Judge Fritz as
the pickpocket who, after robbing Mrs.
H. A. Freeman of her purse on a. Halght
street car on the night of March 29, used
his revolver in effecting his escape when
brought to bay by .the jurist named.
Hamllton, under . the name of Harry
Day, was sentenced from this city to San
Quentln for burglary in the first degree
on October 31, 1887. He was released July.
31. 1892. On April 1, 1900, under the alias of
Frank Blair, Hamilton was returned to
the prison on the same charge from Lios
Angeles County and remained in confine
ment until November 18, 1901.
Another of the gang captured was Jo
seph King, well known as the "preacher
convict." King was sent from this city
to Folsom Prison to serve a four-year
sentence on January 28, 1898, for burglary,
and he -was released on February 4, 1893.
On May 7 of the latter. year he was sent
to San Quentln to serve a five-year sen
tence on the same charge and was re
leased December 29 of last year. King
was one of the "red shirt" gang that con
spired to escape in 1899. but. whose efforts
were frustrated by. Convict "Sir" Harry
Westwood Cooper, one of the gang, who
turned informer. After .King's last re
lease he immediately professed repent
ance for his wild career and traveled
about the State under the guise of a re
formed . criminal, preaching Christianity.
His severe criticisms on the discipline at
San Quentin brought him- into notoriety
and his renunciations were believed to be
sincere. Charles Montgomery, the prison
philanthropist, took an interest in King's
case and urged other Christian people to
join him in keeping the criminal in the
straight and' narrows, path.

in spite of the. rapid growth of, the city,
and the time (has arrived -when 7 the de-,
partment should be, thoroughly equipped
with men and ; officers so . as to properly
patrol the city and ; bring it up to date.
To accomplish that desirable end we re
quire. 200 men Instead of 100, with the
proper number of officers." -
Chief "Wlttman, was considerably.disap
pointed yesterday when 'ho was notified
of Auditor . Baehr's action , in - incorpora
ting into the police estimates an appro
priation if or '; an additional 100 men only.
The Chief announced his intention of ac
companying .the" Police Commissioners ,to
the-.Board of Supervisors to-morrow to
urge upon the board absolute neces-
Bity, of increasing the' force to the capa
city allowed by ; the charter.
"It would be' Impossible with 100 addi
tional men to .divide the men into eight
hour; watches,", said the. Chief yesterday.
"TO do that: we .'require 700 .men alto
gether to properly patrol the city. 1 With
the men at present at my command it is
not possible for .- the city to be - properly
patrolled, but even though we should get
the 100 men suggested by the Auditor we
must have officers to control them.
"The charter says. there must be- one
captain- for each 100 men. If the force
is increased to 700 men -that would make
seven captains, but I am only asking for
six altogether. -At present there are only
three,' the vacancies caused by. the re
tirement of Captain Gillin and my pro
motion not having been filled yet. I would
be also, entitled to fourteen lieutenants,
but I: am only asking for twelve. At
present. there are only six. Then, in re
gard to -sergeants, I am only asking for
fifteen additional,- although, according to
the charter, -which <Â¦ says that there shall
be as many as. the Police Commissioners
may deem . necessary, but not. to exceed
â¢one to each ten patrolmen,! am entitled
to many more than I ask for. :

A Clever Counterfeit
Imitation of a Famons Toilet

Trade Mark, Box and the
Label Forged.
Lucky Discovery of the
Spurious Article.
"While It may bo true that "Imitation Is
the sincerest form of flattery." It does not
fellow that the originator and owner of a
valuable copyrighted article will quietly
submit to the knave who steals the honest
man's money by deliberate forgery. A
well-known Boston business man. who
has. by patient industry, keen inslglirW
and honest effort, built up a large and
constantly Increasing business, discov-
ered a few months ago that some one.
who ought to be repenting in prison, had
made and was selling in . San Francisco
an inferior article, which bore but a faint
resemblance to the original, and by th-j
use of the photo-electrotype process had
forged the box label, the circular and
trade mark of Ben Levy's Lablacha
Face Powder, which is known all over
the world, and is in general use by the
best and most distinguished women, not
only in America, but .also in â¢Â¦ London.
Paris, Dresden. Hongkong, Shanghai,
Mexico and Manila, and, in fact, every-
where. Its virtues have been sounded by
Sarah Bernhardt, Mme. Emma Eames..
Miss Maude Adams. Mile. Rhea. Mile, da
Lussan, Mme. Emma Calve, Mme. Su-
zanne Adams. Miss Marguerita Sylva, -
Miss Lettice Fairfax and- by. scores of.
other famous women of the stage and in:
private life.
Of. course, it goes without the saying
that if Lablache Face Powder were but
a mere Â¦ combination of common chalk
and perfume no one would have forged
Ben Levy's name and attempted to steal
his business. It is only valuable signa-
tures and articles of fame that are
forged. When Mr. Levy's attention was
called to this matter he immediately con-
sulted his attorneys, Messrs. Brandeis. .
Dunbar & Nutter of Boston, and Messrs.
Rothschild & Ach of San Francisco, who
brought a bill of complaint in the United
States Circuit Court of Northern Califor-
nia against J. M. "Wright & Co. of San
Francisco, the sellers of this spurious
powder, and obtained an injunction pro-
hibiting further sales. Suit Is also
brought to recover damages.
The forger did his work so cleverly;
that careful scrutiny is necesary to de-
tect the difference between the genuine
and the spurious. The box label of the
genuine Is clear and bright, while the
printing of the counterfeit label is dark
and muddy. Mr. Levy feels that his rep-
utation is at stake, and he la sparing no
trouble or expense to right this wrong.
The Lablache Powder Is a positive ben-
efit to the complexion, and la the most
delightful preparation of the kind known,
while the spurious article la deleterious
and liable to cause Injury. Mr. Levy
asks that every lady using the LablachÂ»
will examine the label carefully, and If
in doubt as to the genuineness of the ar-
ticle to send to Ben Levy & Co., 123 King-
ston street. Boston, the circular or the
cover of the box, together with the name
of -the dealer from whom it Â¦was pur-
chased, and if it is counterfeit she will
bo advised by return mall, so that she
can demand that her money be refunded,
and whoever sold It will be prosecuted
bjr Ben Levy & Co. to the full extent of
the law.
