ARGUMENTS as to whether or not Police Judge Frits,

Gage, had jurisdiction under the code to proceed with the.prelim
inary hearing of the case, were made yesterday before Judge
Frits by A. A. Moore, representing Governor Gage, and Colonel
E. F. Preston, representing Messrs. Spreckels and Leake. Moore
contended that no magistrate had the right to try the case or hold
the preliminary hearing .but .the Justice of the Peace who issued
the warrants. Judge Frits took the matter under advisement.
He will render his decision next Tuesday.
; If the' arguments did not develop any
thing else they settled beyond a shadow of
a doubt that Governor Gage thinks San
Pedro has "any old place ' on th6 map
beaten to a pulp" when it comes down to
trying editors for libel. It also gave the
attorneys for Messrs. Spreckels and
Leake a chance to make a flat-footed an
nouncement that if the court did not see
fit to bring out.the facts here in this city,
under a preliminary examination upon

first, last and all the time a Nicaragua

an agreement could not be reached
through the acceptance by the Senate
conferees of the Nicaragua canal bill, he
would yield to the Spooner amendment.
Hepburn replied, "I am for a canal."

Some significance is attached to the ap
pointment of Representative Fletcher of
Minnesota as one of the conferees,
as Fletcher was one of only . two
members of the House who voted
against the Nicaragua canal bill in Jan

publican on the committee, becomes one
of the conferees by legislative procedure.
He alone could not stop legislation in the
conference committee should he decide to
hold out. His friends think he will con
fine his efforts solely to voting to retain
the House bill.
Hepburn reiterated his statement to
day that he should hold out as long as
possible for the Nicaragua bill to be
passed by the House.
The contest, however, will not be pro
longed and with Senator Morgan, father
of all legislation, urging the Senate bill,
the House conferees will yield and without
any delay the measure will finally pass

In accordance with this request Hepburn
asked unanimous consent this afternoon
to take the bill from the Speakers table
and proceed to the Senate for conference.

fires are raging a few miles south of this
city and are reported as having already
destroyed one logging camp and to be
threatening others. They are being driv
en by a stiff breeze from the north.
The employes from Page's Camp. Eagle
Gorge, arrived here at 9 o'clock and tell
a thrilling story of escape. Fire struck
the camp at noon to-day, descending
upon it in a roaring sheet of flame. A
narrow path to safety remained, and
men, women and children to the number
of sixty hurried through It. Three men
feared to try the pass and made their
escape by wading through the river and
up the line.
It Is reported that seven men from
Smith's camp on Cedar River, which was
burned, are missing, but the report can
not be verified.
Hot Springs, which has been twice de
stroyed in previous years, sent an urgent
call for help. At 4 o'clock a special
Northern . Pacific train carried another
contingent of the Tacoma fire department
to that town.
At Enumclaw and Buckley the people
have piled their household goods on wag
ons and hitched up their horses, ready to
leave on short notice. Some were leav
ing to-night on Northern Pacific trains.
Early this afternoon the fire destroyed
a row of buildings on the east side of
Buckley. -A strong wind was blowing
from the east and everything in
dicated that the town was doomed. The
flume which supplies Buckley with water
had been burned earlier in the day, cut
ting off the entire water supply. Shortly
before 3 o'clock firemen, engines and hose
arrived from Tacoma. The firemen went
to work with a will and soon had a half
mile of hose pouring water upon the
flames. They prevented the fire spreading
further and have saved Buckley.
For two weeks the weather has been dry,
rendering the timber and underbrush easy
prey to" flames. At noon to-day the large
mill of the White River Lumber Com
pany, near Enumclaw, was burned, to
gether with the company's houses, twen
ty in all. Fine buildings on a score of
farms adjacent to Enumclaw were swept
away.
Early this afternoon the mill of the
Mountain Mill Company, together with
the dry kilns and a large stock of lum
ber, were destroyed. Small mills in the
vicinity of Buckley were burned.
In the logging camps of the White River
Lumber Company are several dozen wo
men and children, entirely surrounded by
flames and in the greatest danger. Their
husbands and fathers left early this
morning to fight fires some distance
away. Before they could return the
flames had encircled their homes.
The nres are worst in White Valley,
which is given up chiefly to lumbering.
The entire . country between Buckley,
Enumclaw and Hot Springs is a blazing
furnace, which no man can approach and
live. It is certain that there has been
loss of life in the country districts
burned oVer, but no authentic reports can
be received until the fire burns itself out.
TACOMA, June 20.â Forest fires are
blazing so fiercely In the foothills of the
Cascade Mountains that the prosperous
towns of Buckley. Enumclaw and Hot
Springs are in danger of total destruction.
Tacoma has sent fire department aid to
Buckley and Hot Springs. The firemen are
working heroically to save those towns,

he would live' some years longer, and un

health and spirits than for some time
previously.
It now transpires that he renounced his
faith in the doctrine of spiritualism on
his deathbed. A well-known citizen of
this place is authority for the statement
that White in hie last remaining mo

After having lain all day In trenches
full of water, fighting hard and suffering
tortures from the heat, the two battalions
of the Ninth brought in. their wounded lo
the city. It was then found that their
casualties were ninety-one men and five
officers. Colonel Liscum was buried at
Tongku.
The Ninth was through the whole of
the Chinese campaign and remained as
the American garrison through the win
ter.' In June, 1301, the regiment returned
to the Philippines, and eight days after
landing the second battalion, under Lieu
tenant Colonel Morris C. Foote, was sent
to Samar, the rest of the regiment foi
lowing two months later.
The massacre of the members of Com

The Ninth Infantry is perhaps the most
famous infantry regiment in the United
States army. It haa had a long and glori

different campaigns covered with honor
and glory.
STORY OF THE NINTH.
"I went back with Captain Bookmiller's
command the next day, to identify the
bodies of the slain and was horror-strick
en. The heads and shoulders of the offi
cers were .almost burned from their bodies,
and in the gaping wounds made by the
bolos blackberry jam had been poured.
The bodies of three of the men had been
thrown into a well and covered with cod
fi&U. We were pretty well avenged by
Major Waller's command, however, and
when the Eleventh Infantry arrived at
Samar, they did not folget the dastardly
manner in which we haa been treated."
Sergeant Pickett was unable to describe
the fignt to any extent, having been one

"The massacre was fearful," said Ser
geant jClifford. "Only thirty-six of us es
caped the first assault, but we piled Into
five boats and started for Basey, twenty
five miles away. Seven of the survivors
were lost en route and two died of their
wounds. Of the twenty-six men who
reached Basey. ten were severely wound
ed, twelve slightly wounded, only four
of the entire command getting away with
out wounds. Our three officers. Captain
Cormell, Lieutenant Edward Bumpers
and Major-Surgeftn Richard Griswold,
were killed.

four times by bolos and stilettos in the
fierce onslaught of the natives of Samar,
and Sergeant Pickett was severely cut in
the abdomen with a bolo.
Colonel Charles F. Robe of the Ninth
Infantry, hero of battles in China, came
acme with his regiment on the Hancock.
He shows little trace of the arduous life
he has had since he took command of the
Ninth in China after the death of the
brave Colonel Liscum, killed in the des
perate attack upon Tien Tsln.
"1 have only 400 of my men with me,
ar.-1 they are mostly long timers," said
Crenel Robe. "Companies A, C and T>
art going to Fort Niagara, the other eight
companies and myself being under orders
for Madison Barracks. Of course we are
glad to get back. No, I do not know a
thing about the Smith court martial."

When Major Irvine left Samar the ter

were open; trade was picking up and the

order to slay all over 10 years of age, that
conditions In Samar seemed to justify it,

GENERAL SMITH'S ORDER.
Major R. J. C. Irvine, adjutant of the
regiment and one of the witnesses for
General Smith at his "howling wilderness"
court martial, returned on the Hancock.
He served under General Smith In Sainar
and speaks of his late commander in
terms of the highest admiration.
Of the Ninth Infantry as it fought in
Cuba there were only about thirty-five
men aboard the Hancock, and of the orig
inal organization not more than 400 men

After passing quarantine the Hancock
steamed to an anchorage off Angel Island.
The cabin passengers and fifty discharged
soldiers will be landed this morning at the

panies, aggregating 344 men, will be sent
to the casual camp at Angel Island and
the Ninth Infantry will be landed at the
Presidio, from where they will be sent

that has cost the organization virtually
its whole original strength.
The army transport Hancock, with the
headquarters, band and ten companies of
the famous Ninth United States Infantry,
Colonel C. F. Robe, commanding, arrived
last night from Manila. The trooper
reached port just before sundown, in time
to pass quarantine inspection, but Just
late enough to necessitate all hands, of
ficers, privates and civilians, remaining on
board until this morning.
"This thing has not hurt the bank,"
said Million to-night. "The stockholders
will, of course, suffer, but nearly every
one of them is worth the full amount of
the loss. It is a nasty thing and I sup
pose we will be 'joshed' for being taken
in on that forged paper; still, everything
looked regular, and what lulled our sus
picions was the fact that Lyon personally
was not benefiting by the cashing of the
notes. The proceeds were turned over to
Clary. All he got was the bank stock.
Besides," added Judge Mi'lion ruefully,
"we. certainly did get a fine report from
Dun on the reliability of the men who
were supposed to have signed the notes."
Sheriff Wells of Skagit County arrived
in this city to-day and took Lyon back to
Mount Vernon. 0
LADEN" WITH BOGUS PAPER.
"When Lyon was searched at the police
station more than $310,000 worth of bogus
paper was found on him. It consisted of
drafts on the national correspondents of
banks throughout the country, duly
signed by the cashiers of the banks and
made out In blank.
â¢ When the Mount Vernon people found
how Lyon had "protected" his check on
them it occurred to them to inquire Into
the genuineness of the notes which they
had cashed. A few telegrams disclosed
that all the names were forgeries and
that the indorsements were likewise
bogus. , ...
The bank officials asked Dun's Com
mercial Agency for a report on the relia
bility of the makers of the notes and re
ceived a report that they were good for
almost any amount. Thereupon $10,000
.was advanced to Lyon, says Million.
After purchasing Clary's stock Lyon
lived at Mount Vernon for a month and
then went East. The bank heard nothing
until it received a telegram from Kansas
City that Lyon had drawn his personal
check on the Mount Vernon Bank for
$12,000.
The bank officials wired that it would
protest the check, as Lyon was without
authority to draw on them for any such
amount. In reply came a telegram from
Lyon himself, saying that he had placed
$12,000 to the bank's credit in Chicago to
protect his check; and requested them to
honor the latter. The bank wired to Chi
cago to know if such a sum had been
placed to its credit and received an af
firmative reply. Then it paid the check.
A few days later, however, it^was ac
certained that Lyon, to protect his check,
had drawn through a bank in Oklahoma
on the Mount Vernon' Bank's New York
correspondent for $6000 and on its Seattle
correspondent for $9500. The New York
bank had paid the draft, but payment on
the Seattle dnfft was stopped by the Mount
Vernon jfeople. They discovered the fraud
in time. Lyon had used the bank's own
funds to protect his check on them.
GOOD REPORT FROM DUN.
The story Is that when Lyon went to
Mount Vernon to buy the interest in the
bank, he brought letters of recommenda
tion from a Boston trust company. He
negotiated for the purchase of Clary's
stock and a price was agreed upon. Cla
ry's stock was hypothecated with the
Seattle National Bank. Lyon agTeed to
assume the amount that the Seattle Na
tional had advanced on Clary's stock and
to pay the difference in cash.
E. C. Million, president of the bank,
admits that the bank cashed forged notes
for Lyon in order that Lyon might pay
Clary for his stock. Million says that
the bank advanced $10,000 on the notes,
although their face value was much more.
This, with the $6000 unauthorized draft
which Lyon made on the bank's New
York correspondent makes the bank's
admitted loss $16,000.

chasing. The signatures to the notes, it
Is claimed, were forged, as were the in

â¢ Jones devoted considerable time to the
discussion of the question of .the ability
of the Filipino people for self-government.
He quoted Professor Schurman, president
of the first Philippine Commission, to the
effect that the Filipino people desired In
dependence, were entitled to.it, were-ca
pable ,jot governing themselves and were
entitled to self-government. -
Jones argued that under the provisions
of the bill the friar lands which the Gov
ernment was to purchase would find their
way into the hands of corporations. He
declared that in his opinion it would be
better for the Filipino people to live un
der the present hybrid rule than to have
imposed upon them the -civil- government
proposed by the pending measure, which
would enable that civil government to dis
pose of all the valuable franchises In
these islands, to strip the forests of their
timber and to sell the agricultural lands
to corporations and syndicates.

Filipinos are an alien people. He charged
President Roosevelt with acting In the
Filipino matter without the authority of
Congress such as was conferred on him
by a meager resolution.
"At no stage of the game," said he,
has he done Congress the honor to ask
advice or counsel." The chief question
to his mind, he said, was not so much one
of good government as it is one of self
government. "There is only one man,"
he declared, with emphasis, "in all the
world who can stop the war and that
man is Theodore Roosevelt.
"I eay to you, Theodore Roosevelt," he
exclaimed with vehemence, "that if you
are earnest in your loud declarations and
want these people to have their liberty
and their independence then say it to the
world, and Congress and the people will
back you up and hostilities will cease."
Adams (R.) called attention to the fact
that only yesterday orders had gone for

evidence of the pacific Intentions of the

Physician Who Seeks to Demonstrate
a Tuberculosis Theory Makes
a Statement.
PARIS, June 20.â Dr. Garnault, the phy
sician who has inoculated himself with
matter taken from a consumptive cow in
order to disprove Professor Koch's theory
that it is impossible for human beings to*
catch tuberculosis from cattle, to-day In
formed a correspondent that he has been
misquoted. He does not propose that Dr.
Theobald Smith, professor of comparative
pathology at the medical school of Har

the present experiment if tuberculosis de
clares itself. Should the experiment fail,
however, then Dr. Garnault shall place
himself in communication with Professor
Smith and Professor Baumgarten of
Tuebingen.who, he says,. 'if they do not
icllow Koch completely,, yet express
dcubts, which impose on them grave ob
ligation." .
"I do not ask Dr. Smith or Professor
Baumgarten to imitate me," continues
Dr. Garnault, "but if the experiment fails
I ask them to assure, in concert with me
a new,-^decisive experiment, to be prac

Dr. Garnault also says that he chooses

ROME, June 20.â The Papal Secre
tary of State, Cardinal Ram
polla, to-day assured the Right
Rev. Thomas O'Gorman, Bishop of
Sioux Falls, S. D., that the Vat
ican accepts the proposition of Judge
Taft, Governor of the Philippines, re
garding the disposition of the friars' lands,
on all the main points, but dissents on
minor points.
The official documents are being pre
pared at the Vatican and will soon be de
livered to Judge Taft. The American
party waited patiently at the Hotel
Qulrlnal for the reply, but as this dis
patch is forwarded it was still not received.
There is little doubt that the answer will
be a substantial acceptance of the main
points of Judge Taft's proposals, which
include the payment of about $1,000,000 for
the friars' lands and a smaller sum for
the rental of the friars' lands used by the
army and the deportation of the friars to
Spain. The actual sums will be fixed by
arbitration. :
Judge Taft has prepared a tentative
fcrm of agreement to use If agreeable to
the Vatican. \
If the answer comes to-night Judge Taft
will to-morrow apply to Mgr. Gasspari,
Secretary of the Congregation Extraor
dinary in Ecclesiastical Affairs, for in
"Id"rmatlon on the subject.

Patterson opposed the Philippine bill

of colonization and empire." Â¦â¢--
Kahn of California concluded the debate
of the afternoon in a speech . which was
listened to with close attention by mem
bers, on both .sides of the House. It was
largely a personal narrative of his trip to
the . Philippines last year.- He told of -a
personal interview with Aguinaldo at
which the latter admitted that no prom
ises of independence had been made to
him by Dewey and Wildman. He con
cluded as* follows: .
â¢ .There is'one Instance in our national history
when the policy I of I scuttle, after being over
whelmingly repudiated at the polls, was nev
ertheless adopted by the: then Democratic ad
ministration. I refer to the "fifty-four forty
or fight" campaign of 1S44. It ia true that
when the question of our Oregon boundary
came up in the Senate in 1846 a large major
ity, of the Senators, voted to ratify the treaty
by which we relinquished all of that territory
which is now known as British Columbia If
we had -held our ground at that period, Eng
land to-day would not have a single portion
the Pacific Ocean side of the American con
tinent. The commerce of the Orient coming
across 'the Pacific -would . have had. to pass
through an American port. * There would have
been no Alaskan, boundary dispute to plague
us, and, sir, Â¦ I for one, do not propose, with
my vote at -least, to sanction another mistake
of . a similar character.
, At 5 o'clock Kahn yielded the floor and
a recess was taken; until 8 o'clock.
, Â¦. At , the evening session Kahn resumed
Now that he is dead, I venture the pre
diction that it will, not be long before gentle
men on the other side will â¢ have appropriated
his memory to their own uses, and will have
his' picture among their own stage proper
ties iand will be quoting his utterances as
"apples of gold arid pictures of silver " even
as they are quoting the utterances 'of Ab
raham Lincoln. Verily, the successors and
assigns of those who stoned the prophets now
burn incense to their memory, and garnish
the sepulchero of the righteous. We seldom

then we make up for the mean lies we tell
of them while they are living by the good
lies we tell of them after they are dead. At
the end of the campaign of 1000 .the. old Pop
ulistic banner marked "Imperialism and 16

ried by a procession of discontent, with out
riders of necromancers, soothsayers, sword
swallowers, serpentine dancers and experts in

other side of the chamber, "that you'crit

"It is the indiscriminate criticism of the
army that we protest against," interjected
Steel of Indiana.-.
"There has been no such indiscriminate
criticism," answered Williams of Illinois.
"It has been a recital of specific cases."
"It is not the soldiers who should be

commonwealth.
Mr. Mooreâ May It please your Honor, I now
find it my duty as well as my pleasure to eay
that this argument which, your Honor has now
heard Is entirely ornamental; It has no real
relevance to the subject-matter. Counsel com
mtneed his statement by saying that these de
fendants had beÂ»n brought before your Honor
They never were brought before your Honor.
There gentlemen wÂ«-re never brought before
year Honor at all. There is nothing here be
fore your Honor now at all. i have no fault to
find with any of the decisions that have been
read from. by my learned brother notably, so
far as 1 understood them, the English cases
about a magistrate holding a man in one
county and committing him for trial In an
other county. * t -
HO BIGGER THAU ANY MAW.
But in this case he If not brought before the
Justice to be tried. Consequently all these
portions of the code relating to examinations
have an application to this case which they
could not have in the case of any other misde
meanor.
The eystem of Jurisprudence upon which our
code Is founded, if you know what all the
learning of the English bar on this subject was
at the time this code was made, may perhaps
assist in a construction. There Is no sanctity
about the Jurisdiction of a committing magis
trate, as I have repeated time and time again.
A man is addressed as a magistrate, which is a
different capacity from his Judicial capacity.
He is not bound by the same hard and fast
lines, and -he is simply an officer of the law,
to inquire whether it Is probable that an of
fense has been committed, and if a man is ap
prehended in another county there is no reason
v.-hy, in sense, in Justice, or in anything of
'.hat sort, a committing magistrate in that
county where he Is apprehended might not take
him under examination, and if necessary com
mit him for trial.
CAPACITY OF MAGISTRATE.
numerous cases in which, by the special pro
visions-Df particular statutes, the Justice has
Jurisdiction respecting the offenses therein
Er*clfied, though committed out of his coun
ty. Thus It has lone been settled that if a
man commit a felony in one county and go into
another county, a Justice of the latter county
may, upon Information given, issue a warrant
to apprehend him and take his examination
and the information against him; and may
commit him to the Jail of such latter county
and bind over the witnesses to give evidence
at the trial.
A committing- magistrate may perform func
tions; it is rot necessary that he should have
Jurisdiction over the offense, nor is It necessary
that he should be in the county, to commit.
Although it be generally true that a Justice
has no Jurisdiction over offenses committed
out of his county, yet there are cases where
the presence of an offender, within his county,
Elves him authority at common law to pro
ceed against such offender; and there are also
If you read the first section on preliminary
examinations literally it disposes of the case,
bt cause the language is identical: "When ta
ken before the magistrate." You will noticj
that :n Â£26 it savs "is brought before a mag
istrate." In section S22 there Is the eame lan
fruage exactly â "take him. before a magis
trate."
I say, if you take all those provisions of the
code together, and do not limit yourself to
826. nor to S09. nor to S5S. but read the whole
end construe them together, you will find that
the code provides for informations being file.1
without the county where the examination Is
held. That you may commit is beyond ques
tion. Section 80S in trrms rro\*ides_that when
the defendant is brought before the magistrate
upon ac arrest the magistrate must proceed
â¢with the examination. Section 826 furnishes
the machinery by which you may do it.
MUST GO ON WITH CASK
Now, after the arrest haa_ been made and
the defendant has been taken before a magis
trate â you take section S5S; it provides that
when you are taken before tha magistrate upon
an arrest he must immediately inform you.
There you find the words "immediately upon
arrest." When you are taken before a mag
istrate upon .arrest you commence these pro
ceedings in ic-gard to examination.
Mr. Preston â Then he Is not limited to his
own county. He can file that information in
any county in which the ofTense is triable.
I am glad for the admission.
Mr. Moore â It means what it says.
Section 826 provides that "If a defendant Is
brought before a magistrate other than the
one who issued the warrant the depositions on
which the warrant was granted must be sent
to that magistrate, or, if they "cannot be pro
cured, thfÂ» prosecutor and his witnesses must
be summoned to give their testimony anew."
If your Honor will go back to section 809
of the code, you will find that It was evi
dently in contemplation that a defendant might
etand committed in one county for trial in
finothrfi as I will show you was the universal
court? of the English criminal law, on which
this code is founded, and from which some
of its provisions are taken bodily.
Section 803 provides that if a defendant has
been examined and committed "It shall be the
duty of the District Attorney, within thirty
days thereafter, to file in the Superior Court
of the county in which the offense is triable.''
What does that mean?
So that the ordinary Jurisdiction of a Jus
tices' court of an outside township in a county
Â¦n-here it is not controlled by some special
legislation which has clothed it with the power
for all misdemeanors. Is not to try a case cf
criminal libeL Hence, the Justice who Issued
this warrant cpuld not try this case. This
is not an application to have your Honor try
this cs.t-0.
COULD NOT TRY CASE.
6tat* present a rather peculiar proposition.
Criminal libel was one cf the offenses which,
by the constitution, was not otherwise pro
vided for, and it was therefore left to a prose
cution by complaint and indictment or infor-,
rrc&tion.
I think we all agree that, so far as libel is
concerned, its present status Is that it Is
triable, in this city and county, for instance.
In a. Police Court. It is, po6sibly and probably,
triable In a Police Court in the city of Los
Angeles, though I do not assert that as an
absolute provision.
The code provides that a Justice of the
Peace has Jurisdiction of 'â¢petty larceny, as
eault or battery not charged to have been
Â¦committed upon a public officer in the dis
charge of hU duties, or to have been com
mitted Â¦with such intent as to render the of
fense a felony; breaches of the peace, riots,
routs, affrays, committing a willful Injury to
property and all misdemeanors, punishable by
fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not
exceeding elx months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment."
As yet the Embassador has not seen
Secretary Hay. It is said he may ' ask
that this government apologize for Ad
miral Crowinshleld's comment. "Whether
such an apology will be made Is not
known. Rear Admiral Crowninshield has
been asked to explain how his report
became public when the authorities in
tended to suppress the matter In the
Interest of good feeling. It is supposed
that his disapproval was published in
squadron orders and a copy of these fell
into the hands of newspaper correspond
ents after the Illinois-arrived in English
waters. As he was not directed to with
hold his comment, he can hardly be
blamed for its publication.
"There are no developments. To-mor

Then there may be something for me to
say."

The Court â I will be prepared to announce a
decision in this matter on Tuesday morning
As it is at present, there is no case before the*
court, but I will determine at that time whether
or not in my opinion I have a right to proceed
and hear the preliminary examination. (
Section 823 of the code, upon which counsel
lays such stress, cannot apply to a Justice's
court. What I say Is that if you take the in
formation â I want to say one word there
Chapter 3 treats of the information, and it says
that the complaint Is the allegation in writing
to a magistrate that a person has been guilty of
some designated offense. Then, "a magistrate
is an officer having power to issue a warrant "
etc Then, "the following persons are magis
trates." Then comes section 809. The District
Attorney, if the defendant is committed is to
file an information. Showing that this- thing

submit the case.
WILL DECIDE TUESDAY.
You talk about haling rich men. You go into
the mountains of San Diego or up into the lava
beds of Modoc and swear to a complaint or
you can go to Wilmington or any remote In
accessible portion of the earth, hundreds of
miles away from witnesses, hundreds of
miles away from records, hundreds of miles
away from everything that will elucidate and
prove and throw light upon the charge and
then when we ask for what we think is our
right under the law, to be examined here be
fore a magistrate, at a place and at a time
and to go on immediately, we are to be
charged that this is for the purpose of delay
We say that the language here, read as an
ordinary man would read it. gives us right to
be examined where we are arrestedâ in -this
where we are entitled to a preliminary exami
nation. And what is it. your Honor? What is
this great Important question about which we
have been brought through from Runnymede
down to the theep country? A magistrateâ all
standing equal before the lawâ to pass upon the
simple question as to whether there li prob
able cause to hold these men to be tried What
particular divinity or sanctity hedges about
that act? We have seen that by the English
law It was the custom, it was the law that
they could commit. '
SHEEP MENTIONED AGAIN.
It is our right to be examined before a mag
istrate to find out whether it is probable that
a crime has been committed or not before you
can, be haled, as the gentleman says, five hun
dred miles to the little dirty village of San
Pedro for that Important purpose. He says
that this is for delay. How soon could these
facts have been brought forth had the fountain
head of all the sources of Information been
approached by this complaining witness? That
Is all buncombe and claptrap. These defend
ants do not desire delay, but they do not de
sire to be taken down to a Justice of the Peace
at San Pedro, where they have been haled by
the Governor of the State, for a preliminary
examination. We say that is not the law
We say it is against the reason of the law'
and that it is against right. The gentleman
took exceptions this morning â why, there have
been cases of which I have readâ I don't vouch
for their authenticityâ where Justices of the
Peace have ordered men hanged for horse
stealing; and hanged they were, by the body
of the county, before aid could reach them I
don't know what a Justice of the Peace 'out
on the deserts might do if a case came before
him. I am not speaking of this gentleman be
cause he 1b a stranger. I am showing' the
absurdity of this thing. Courts and their
Jurisdiction have nothing whatever to do with
this motion.
WANT SPEEDY HEARING.
Mr. Moore (interrupting) â Pardon me a mo-.
noent; you commenced that this morning by
saying that this was a case where the Gov
ernor of the State was interested. "
Mr. Prestcn â I will cite the gfntleman to
section 1875 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
which requires courts to take Judicial notice
of the head of the Government, and I say that
this court will take Judicial notice of the fact
that Henry T. Gage is the Governor of the
State of California, and it will take judicial
notice, too, that by the terms of the Political
Code, his official residence Is In Sacramento
and not at Wilmington.
Mr, Mooreâ And that he is the only Henry
T. Gage, the only one in the world.
Mr. Preston â I did not interrupt you. I will
wait until you are through.
Mr. Moore â I won't Interrupt you again.
Mr. Preston â I thank you very much. "We
have gone to the sheep country and the shep
herd. J don't know why the gentleman speaks
of liheep or shepherds. There has been noth
ing of that kind charged here. There has been
nothing of that kind in this case. He then
seems to iterate this question of . Jurisdiction
and trial, and that a man may take Jurisdic
tion up in Modoc of a libel in Los Angeles
and that he may have him working in the
grounds at Modoc. I have never said anything
of that kind. He talks about the fact that this
code is an Improvement upon the system of
English Jurisprudence.
Mr. Preston â I will only say a few words.
Tour Honor will notice that I presented this
case without mentioning any names; that I
discussed nothing but the principles of law
involved, relying upon the codes and the au
thorities which had construed them, and the
procedure upon which tliey were founded. I
have listened to a disquisition running down
from the armored barons of Runnymede and
my old friend King John "
TALKED OF SHEEP.
That your Honor can, with nothing: before
you, try the case or examine it, seems to me
utterly absurd.
I don't say these gentlemen did anything. I
don't say they are guilty of anything. I have
no right to say so. There has been no exam
ination; there has been no trial. I simply say
they have been ch'arged. I don't care what
Archbold says. I will not take the time to
scrutinize the text of Archbold to see what
in olden times those Justices of the Peace
might do in England. I won't scrutinize
Comyns to see what they might do. I won't
scrutinize this case In 55 Massachusetts, I de

trying him here, he could not resist your de
mand to try him here, away from his fellows,
away from men who might know of the sub
ject matter. He might be charged by some
large landed proprietor, â¢who as Â¦well might try
the case here as elsewhere, but the poor shep
herd, finding himself here charged with a
crime committed in Los Angeles County, if
your Honor insisted on trying him, as you
would be obliged to Insist on trying him If

EL. PASO, Tex.. June 20.â Frank
Vaughaa. a cattleman of Sonora, Mexico,
Â¦who is returning home after a trip
through New Mexico, brings news of a
â¢wholesale killing in the mountains east of
Tueumari. . â¢ . . >: V*
Bud Lee. a young cattleman, has been
in the habit of driving his cattle to some
springs about thirty-five miles from, Tu
cumari for water. They are the only
source of water for miles around and
other cattlemen claimed that he allowed
his cattle to tramp around in them, bog
ging , them up. This led to trouble and
. threats.
Several days ago Lee, in company with
a man seventy years old, an old Indian
fighter, drove his htrd as customary to
the springs. Both were heavily armed.
Word reached Lee that eight punchers
were on the lookDUt for him and he was
prepared for trouble. Lee says it was
their intention â¢ to waylay him and catch
him unawares.
When he got a glimpse of some of them
half a mile away, he and the old man
opened fire with long range guns. A
pitched battle followed. Lee and his part
ner were protected by the shrubbery
around the springs and the running about
of the frightened cattle. The others were
in the open. When the smoke cleared
away Lee saw three men running for life
across the country. Five were dead on
the prairie. He and the old man were
not touched. Lee gave himself up to the
Sheriff.

Richardson, the minority leader, who
also was a member of the committee to
confer with the Senate, explained further
that the Senate had ignored the House's
request for conference with instructions
to its conferees and had sent the bill back
with a simple request for a conference.
The effect of the adoption of the resolu
tion would be that the House in turn
ignored the Senate and sent the bill back
with a stronger insistence on its objec
tion to the objectionable items, it was
not a surrender, he said. Had It been ao
he never would have agreed to it. The
resolution was adopted.
Hull of Iowa called up the army appro
priation bill. He offered a resolution to
disagree to all the Senate amendments,
except 13, 14 and 15 (relating to army
posts). As to 13 and 14, the resolution pro
vided that the House adhere to its dis
agreement, and as to 15, it recede and
agree to the amendment. It was the ac
tion of the House on this bill (in Instruct
ing its conferees) which caused the con
troversy with the Senate ' regarding the
right to take such action.
Dalz^ll of Pennsylvania, one of the
committee appointed to confer with the
Senate on the subject, explained that the
parliamentary effect of the resolution in
declaring the House's purpose to adhere
to its disagreement as to the two amend
ments was to carry Its insistence one
stage further than the adoption of. the
former instructions to the conferees.

LIVES OF FIVE
SENATORS TALK
OF RECIPROCITY
The Cuban Question Dis
cussed in Republican
Conference.
Dozen Speeches Are Made
on the Subject of
Tariff Laws.
WASHINGTON, June 20.â The Republi
can Senators held another conference on
the question of Cuban reciprocity, and
after three hours' discussion adjourned,
subject to the call of Chairman Allison,
without action. Almost all the Republican
Senators who are In the city were pres
ent. Ten speeches were made In support
of reciprocity and two in opposition to
that policy. This was in accord with a
previous understanding that as the beet
sugar Senators had monopolized the at
tention of the conference on Wednesday
night their opponents to-day should hava
the greater share of the time.
The speeches in support of the reci
procity bill were made by Senators For
aker, Beveiidge, Lodge, Hale, Warren,
Aldrich, McComas and Hanna, Senator
Platt of Connecticut adding a few words
to what he had said at the Wednesday
evening meeting. The two speeches in
opposition *to the proposed legislation
were made by Senators Burton and. Bur
rows. The speeches for reciprocity were
along the same general line, and without
exception were pleas for legislation and
for party harmony.
Senator Hanna spoke of the< question
of extending the proper aid to Cuba as
a moral question, saying that our obliga
tions to the Cuban people were 'such that
we would not be true to ourselves as a
nation If we should fall to give them an
encouraging hand at .the beginning of
their national career. He referred to
President McKinley's attitude on this
subject, and quoted the President's Buf
falo speech as making it imperative on
this Government to enter into proper re
ciprocal relations with Cuba.
Senator Burton of Kansas made an
eloquent speech in support and defense
of the attitude of the beet sugar Repub
licans. He took as his text certain re
marks which had been made by Senator
Platt at the Wednesday evening meeting
and by Senator Foraker at to-day's meet
ing. He spoke especially with reference
to an intimation that the beet sugar Sen
ators were not loyal to the party. Ho
said that the press of the country had
presented only one side of the question.
His side, he said, stood for the support of
one of the most promising, as It was ona
of the most deserving, of infant indus
tries.
The beet sugar Interest, he said, was
coming to the front with a rapidity and
a promise to the future such as had
marked the history of few Interests in
this country, and he urged that this in
terest should have the same protecting
care that the Republican party had given
to other struggling industries. He said
that it was not true that the beet sugar
men were not willing to extend a helping
hand to the people of Cuba if they need
ed help, but he contended that there was
no need for assistance to the people of
that island at this time. Nor did he be
lieve that if the contemplated legislation
should be enacted the Cubans would se
cure the benefit.
Senator Burrows spoke very briefly and
his remarks were entirely In replv to Sen
ator Hanna's reference to President Mc-
Klnley's Buffalo speech. Burrows pro
duced a copy of that speech and read ex
tracts from it for the purpose of show
ing that the beet sugar Senators are in
accord with McKinley's position as out
lined in that speech. He laid special em
phasis on the portion of the Buffa!>
speech" in which the President said that
he would not advocate any step that
would remove the proper protection from
American labor and American Industries.
He also quoted the last annual message
of President Roosevelt, saying that th*
beet sugar men were in accord with the
President's position as there outlined.
They claimed, he said, that they were
acting in accord with strict Republican
policy in advocating the protection of the
beet sugar interests.
The conference adjourned to meet at
the call of the chairman, and It is cen
erally believed that another meeting will
occur some time next week.

FATHER'S DEATH
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 21, 1902.
Kern (D.) of Illinois denied the right o:
the United States to frame laws for the
his remarks and described .in detail some
of the cruelties inflicted by Filipinos on
American troops. He made a vigorous
defense of the army and said its good
rame should not be besmirched because
oÂ£ the conduct of the pitiful few. It was
a mistake to assert that the insurrection
would end should the Filipinos, be given
their independence.
"It would only â¢ give the irreconcil
ables." he said, "an incentive for renewed
activity." He added that should inde
pendence be given the '. Filipinos their
cruelties would be so revolting that all
the' fears of the angels could never blot
the record out.

MEMBERS' day will be celebrated
to-morrow at the Sausalito Club
house of the San Francisco Yacht
Club. In pursuance of the policy
of Â£iving as many events as possible of
a kind likely to interest both the owners
s.nd non-yachting members a programme
cf aquatic sports has been prepared by a
cemmittee consisting of Commodore R.
S. Bridgman, Vice Commodore A. C. Lee,
Secretary "W. M. Edgell. A. R. Hasklns
and W. \Y. Halev.
The first event will be called a little
before 11 in the morning, so as to get
through the programme while the weath
er is warm and the water calm. It will
be a swimming race, and will be followed
by high diving from the upper veranda
01 the clubhouse. The third event will
be a barge race in the club boats, two
nien and a cockswain in each crew, the
yachts (jueen, Halcyon, Surprise, Phyllis
ana others supplying crews. The course
will be from toe torpedo destroyer Farra
gut to and round tne yacht Hover and
lack to the club wharf. Tne fourth event
will be a duck hunt, the human duck in
ti tkiff being pursued by two oarsmen in
one of the ciub boats; the duck must be
touched by the hand within a limited
number or minutes. Fifth on^the pro
gramme is walking the greasy pole, to
win in which the contestant must go out
to the end, get a Hag and bring it back.
The sixth event will be a yawl race, one
man blindfolded at each oar, and the
yuwl steered by a girl who has no rud-
Oci , but gives directions to the oarsman.
'ire course will be around a mooring and
LiiCk.
'J he seventh event is a single scull race
in yacnts' yawls, and the eighth a scull
ing race with one scull. For the canoe
sailing race there are three or four en
tries, the course being around the torpedo
destroyer * arragut, tnence to and around
the United States army transport Egbert
and back to the club wharf.
There will be tugs-of-war, i^ one of
Â¦which there will be half a dozen skiffs at
each end of the rope, the boats being
either placed broadside on to the tide or
the team which has the tide against it
Ltiiig ahowed an extra boat on the rope.
After the sports it is proposed to have
a parade of ine yachts, which will cruise
o\tr to the water iront and around Angel
Island or in whatever direction tne
v. either conditions lavor most. Such
r.:embers and guests its desire to take a
hail will be accommodated on the various
yachts of. the fleet.
Last Saturday the sloops Genesta,
lieda, Neptune and Speedwell of the
Corinthian Yacht Club started on the an
nual cruise up the Sacramento River. In
the absence of Commodore E. F. Sager's
tloop Edna Vice Commodore T. Jennings'
sloop Speedwell acted as flagship. The
Jleet was an unusually small one, but the
cruise is much earlier than in former
jears and many of the yachtsmen were
unable to take it. The fleet made' Mar
tinez its first rendezvous, being accom
panied to that point by many Corinthian
yachts, which returned to their Tiburon
raoorings on Sunday. The plan was to
eo through Montezuma slough and then
up the Sacramento River, the leading boat
to tie up as soon after 5 o'clock each aft
ernoon as it arrived at a convenient spot
Jhis plan was adopted last year and
v.crked well, as it insures all the fleet
keeping together. The usual custom has
tees for the rest of the fleet to sail up to
v allejo on Saturday and meet the return
ins boats at that point, but this year the
fleet v.-ill go to McNears Landing. The
tio.e does not serve well to make Vallejo

SAN BAFAEL GOLFERS
TO PLAY A HANDICAP
This afternoon on the links of the San
Rafael Golf Club there will be a handicap
stroke competition for men and women
over eighteen holes, in .-place of the mixed
foursomes sÂ«t down In the schedule.
During the past week H.> M. Sears of
Los Angeles Country Club, amateur
champion of Southern . California, has
been playing on the San . Rafael links.
He drives a remarkably long ball, one of
his drives being 240 ! yards , in the carry.
Though the course was entirely new to
him and is a difficult one to a stranger
he covered each eighten holes in 90 to 94
strokes. Three rounds, or twenty-seven
holes, showed an average of 45 strokes
for each round. ,}"Â¦.:
The club trophy, which takes the place
of the former Council's cup and carries
with it the match play championship of
the San Rafael Golf Club for men, was
won last Saturday by D. E. Skinner, who
defeated J. J. Crooks 3 up 1 to play in
the final round over 36 holes. On the
first two rounds J. J. Crooks was 4 up
against his opponent, but in the last two
rounds^ D. E. Skinner played a strong
game, being dormie 2 at the thirty-fourth
hole. Taking the thirty-fifth, he won the
match 3 up 1 to play. For the Women's

The Marin County representatives will
be C. P. Coles. R. M. Mason, C. Bull, A

To-morrow the Alameda team, accord
ing to the schedule of the California
Cricket Association, was to have jour
neyed to Sacramento to play its first
match of the season against the Sacra
mento Cricket Club. But, much to the
regret of the city cricketers, the game
has been declared off. The Sacramento
Cricket Club, having been deprived of the
services of H. R. and H. F. Elliott, the
two strongest players in the team, and
also having lost Mack of Fair Oaks, feels
compelled to withdraw. The cricketers
of San Francisco and vicinity hope the
Sacramento Club has not retired perma
nently.from the contests for the pennant
of 1902, but that later in- the season it will
find itself able to play the matches set
down on the schedule, especially those
ag-alnst Santa Cruz in August. If a Sac
ramento team is made up later In the
year to-morrow's match against the Ala
meda eleven might be played on one of
the open dates convenient to both clubs
The defeat of the Alameda team by the
Pacific eleven Jast Sunday places the
wearers of the scarlet and black-ln-a fa
vorable position for the^pennant of 1902.
Their percentage reads as follows: Games
played, 4; won, 4; lost, none; percentage
100. If the Sacramento team . does not
play any. of its matches two will be for
feited to the Pacifies, whose standing
will read as follows: Games, 6; won,' 6
lost, none. The Pacifies will then â¢ have
one match to >~ play against Santa Cruz
and three more against the Alameda
team. Of these they may reasonably be
expected to win - at least 60 ;per cent,
which would give them a percentage for
the'season of. 80. As the Alameda eleven
has already lost three matches it cannot
get a higher percentage than 70.' even if it
should win, by default or defeat' of its
opponents, all its remaining matches.
PREPARATIONS for the annual
championship rowing regatta on
. Lake Merritt, July 4, are being
made, and the prospect for a highly
sucessful event is good. The Portland
Rowing Club will send a four-oared crew
and a single-sculler. President W. B.
Hinchman of. the . Pacific Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union has received
the entry of a junior barge crew and eln
gle-sculler from the Stockton Athletic As
sociation. The entries close at S p. m. on.
Monday, the 30th Inst;, at the Olympic
Club.
It appears the South End Rowing Club
will have no. senior barge" crew, "but it
will be represented In the intermediate
and junior barge races. The intermediate
barge crew of the club is going out near
ly every night for practice, and should
give a good account of itself. It consists
of Dr. C. C. Dennis, bow; Ed Wolf, No.
2; J. P. Foley, . No. 3, and Frank Baker,
stroke.
The intermediate and junior barge crews
of the Ariel Rowing Club are going out
every night from the South Ends' house.
1 The Ariel Rowing Club lias been in ex
istence for thirty years and will celebrate
the event next month by a banquet. Al
though several members have left the
club since the boathouse on Long Wharf
had. to be abandoned, the rest have held
together, and after a hard struggle to
maintain the club's existence are very
hopeful. The finances are in good condi
tion and the construction of the proposed
new boathouse will soon be begun. The
membership roll is growing, seventeen
members having been initiated at the
last meeting. These were Dr. J. J. Crow

meeting and that the club roll will be
filled to its limit of one hundred members.

COURSING men with fleet greyhounds
are preparing their charges for the
seventh renewal of the ladies' day
champion stake. This valuable event
Â¦vrtll be decided at Union Coursing Park
July 6, and will be the feature of a. three
days' meeting.
It is limited to sixteen hounds and al
ways attracts the best in the State. The
entrance fee is $25 for each dog. The
Union Park management will add $620,
making a total purse of $1020. The purse
is apportioned by a. committee of the nom
inators on the night of the draw. It is
expected last year's division will be ad
ht-red to. Under this the winner receives
$300, runner-up $200. next two $100 each,
and to next four $50 each. The dog beat
en in the first round by the ultimate win
ner will receive $40, that beaten by the
runner-up $30 and by third and fourth $25
esch.
A sapling stake and a reserve stake will
be run to a conclusion to-day at Union
Park. A class reserve stake will be run
down once. The remaining rounds, with
a special stake and a consolation event,
will form to-morrow's card. The likely
winners look to be:
Sapling stake â Real Pasha, Tricksy and May
Flush.
Reserve stake â Melrose, Game Bird, Dragon
Fly. Crockett Hill, Partial Eclipse, Rustic Ar
bor. Lily Wriznt and Eastlake.
Class reserve â Jennie Noys, Sugarcane, Black
Coon, Aeneae, Gold Hill, Kaal Aristocrat, Va

Cloudburst. Glaucus, Fly by Night, Sernaronius,
Miss Brummel, May Hempstead, White Hat,

Special stakeâ Silver Cioud, Cascade, Roy
Hughle. Homer Boy, Vandal, Tyrone Prince,
Game Boy. Tame Tralee, Palo Alto, Dewdrop.
Liberator. Tralee Boy, Ireland, Fair Oaks, Full
Moon and Rural Artist.
The careful manner in which A. R. Cur
tis handles the best dogs in his kennel
fabould be an object lesson to other own
ers. Beacon, Rector, Flying Fox, Luxor
and other cracks are handled like stake
horses, being sent for only the most im
portant events. They show the effects of
this care, coming out fresh each time
and invariably getting their share of the
prizes. Many great young greyhounds
have been ruined by being run too fre
quently and in not getting sufficient time
to recover from the effects of hard
coursing.
P. J. Horgan has bred Maid of the Mill,
by Skyrocket, to T. J. Cronin's Wild Tra
lee. This is expected to prove a great
cross. . .
J. Tierney has bought Partial Eclipse
from Mr; Horgan.
The Concord Driving Club" has pur
chased sixty acres of land near Concord
for the site of a racetrack. Ten thousand
dollars will be spent on it immediately.
The Infield, which Is pronounced admira
bly adapted for the purpose, will be used
for coursing. Many men near Concord
are interested in greyhounds, and a
meeting will undoubtedly be held there
this winter.
George Shannon thinks so well of his
new greyhound Happy Butte that he will
course it here. He knows the class he
will meet, but has great hopes of the Los
Angeles greyhound distinguishing itself.
The management of Union Park an
nounces a' puppy stake will be run on
July 12 and a sapling stake on the 19th.
The second payment of $2 50 on the Cal
ifornia Futurity stake will be due July 1.
The remaining payment of $5 will be due
on the night of the draw. The stake will
be run in September.

OAKLAND Canoe Club was founded
on January 23, 1886, with fourteen
charter members, among whom
were W. W. Blow of the canoe3
Mystic and Zephyr, A. Dalton Harrison
of the canoe Flirt, Hervey Darneal of
the canoes White Cap and Zoe Mon and
W. Q. Morrow of the canoe Volant. -
The boathouse of the old Mystic Boat
club, which stood on Oakland Creek at
the foot of Alice street, was bought and
remodeled to suit the purposes of the
canoe club. The quarters of the club are
situated on Sessions Basin, near Clinton
station, and contain a large boatroom,
a clubroom, dressing-room, ladies' room
and pantry. The sailing course stretches
for two miles up the creek and for three
miles down the bay.
The officers of the Oakland Canoe Club
are as follows:- Commodore, Philip Ca
duc, owner of the big sloop Annie and the
half-rater Zephyr; vice commodore, How
ard S3. Byxbee, owner of the slocp N14
nette and the canoe Whim; secretary,
Charles Stewart, part owner of the sloop
Beatrice. . â¢ . .-
Or. Decoration day. Independence day,
snd Admission day, the Holiday cup is
raced for, and four times during the year
the Mayrisch- badge Is sailed for by the
canoeists. On these days the members
receive their friends, providing them with
luncheon and dinner, taking them out for
cruises on the creek and amusing them
with sailing and swimming races. At
night a dance is given in the boathouse.
The weather on the creek on May 30 of
this year was so stormy and rough that
it was found impossible to carry out the
canoe races, which will probably be held
on the 29th inst. On an early Sunday,
when the tide is suitable, the canoeists
will cruise to the boathouse of the Enci

.Violate the Liquor Law.
Ludwlg H. Hansen, proprietor of a re
sort at 771 Market street, and James Rob
inson, his bartender, were arrested yes
terday by Policemen Hellman and Gaugh
ran on a charge of selling liquor without
a license. The â¢officers visited tfae plac^
Thursday afternoon In plain. clotnes and
played poker. They were served with
liquor and cigars during the games.
FROM advices received by*the officers
of the California State Flsh Commis
sion, the law prohibiting: the sale of
trout weighing less than half a
pound Is already showing beneflcient re
sults.
It has had the effect of reducing the
number of market fishermen, as It does
not pay them to flsh when there is such a
strongly defined line drawn between what
they may and may not sell. Large flsh.
those greater than a pound in weight, are
being taken In numbers from the Sacra
mento and from the Truckee.
Five and six pound trout are being
taken near Truckee. Deputy Fish Com
missioner Welch saw one man near
Truckee on Saturday with eight fish
which averaged three pounds each. The
anglers are using the brown hackle, gray
hackle with yellow body and the Reuben
Wood.
Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Cooper and George
Walker have returned from a two weeks'
outing on the Upper Sacramento. The
sport was getting better every day up
to the time their vacation ended.
. There are said to be more large fisn
between Le Moyne and the headwaters
of the Sacramento, some forty miles
above, than ever before. This is especial
ly noticeable above Dunsmuir. The
angling is good in front of Shasta Springs,
the trout ranging from one to two and a
half pounds in weight. All the small
streams emptying into the Sacramento
are said to be full of fish. These are not
as large as those taken from the main
stream. .
The trout have just commenced to rise
at Webber Lake and are taking the fly.
C. J. Stovel has been one of the moat
successful of the anglers there. He land
ed a 4H-Pound Loch Leven after a great
battle and lost one which, from-hls ap
pearance and strength, he thought mu3t
have Weighed seven pounds.
C. C. Kinsey sent down a fine box of
fish from Independence Lake on Wednes
day. There are many anglers there, all
getting good returns. A market fisher
man took eighty fish in two hours. With
a companion he caught 115 pounds in a
day. These men fished from rafts, each
man using three rods. These are light
bamboo affairs, such as are used by tha
boys along the wharves. The fish are all
taken on bait, a method which the fly
fishermen scorn.
Reports from Tahoe are not as encour*
aging as from tho other mountain lakes,
few flsh being taken:
Al Cummingr, W. C. Leavitt and Wife,
Dr. Murphy and wife. "W. Elliott and
Prank Lacoste left for Webber Lake dur
ing the week. They took canvas boats
and will fish- in Bass Lake and all the
small lakes in the vicinity of Webber.
"Walter D. Mansfield, president of the
San Francisco Fly-casting- Club, haa
gone to Yosemtte Â¦ Valley on a vacation
trip. He will test his skill. as an angler
in the well stocked streams of the valley.
James "Watt is on the Upper Sacramento
and is reported to be- enjoying himself
hugely.
Charles Precht left yesterday for Floris
ton, on ; the Truckee, famous for the
grand fishing it affords in- that vicinity.
Among the arrivals at Verdi during the
week were: Thomas Rickard and wife,
Berkeley; John C. Hill and son, Oakland:
L. P. Fitzgerald, 'Mill Valley; D. J. Daly

Though Owner Baldwin and Trainer
Spiers both announced positively that
Cruzadcs would not start, owing: to the
slight injury received in the Derby trial
race at Harlem, they appeared to-day to
change their minds. They now announce
there is a strong possibility that the son
of the Emperor of Norfolk will go to the
post-
There has been Quite a rumor also that
the famous Santa Anita stable is counting
on Escalar.te to carry its colors and that
Cruzados is not really as good a colt as
Escalante.
CHICAGO, June 20.â Thirteen horses
are entered to start In to-morrow's
American Derby. It Is possible one
or two others will be added to the
list to-morrow morning, making one of
the largest fields ever seen in the race.
The practical assurance of a heavy
track may be responsible for the starting
of several horses whose owners think
they will have a chance In this kind of go-
Ing, which they would not have under
other conditions. Owners do not have to
make their final declarations until 10
f o'clock to-morrow morning, and it Is pos
sible that some surprises may be sprung
at the last moment The list as announc
ed to-night, together with the latest bet

The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that a posthumous child has no legal
status in an action for damages. Annie
Daubert brought suit for and recovered
$5000 damages for the death of her hus
band through the alleged negligence or
the Western Meat Company. A child was
born subsequently, and action for further
damages was brought in its name. The
court holds that the suit is wholly -with
out merit.
Loses Suit for Damages.
A similar injunction, pending the pro
ceedings In the suit of the Pacific States
Telephone and Telegraph Company
against Tax Collector Smith, was issued
by Judge Morrow. The company alleges
that the assessment of $1,500,000 on its
franchise is $1,200,000 in excess of the
actual cash value of the same and asks
to have . the assessment set aside.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow is

manding him. to cease further proceedings
in the matter of the contemplated sale of

ing June 30, 1902. The company alleges
that it was assessed arbitrarily in the sum
of $750,000 for Its franchise, which assess
ment is alleged to be Inordinately in ex

asks that the assessment be set aside.

in the same condition shortly.
The Gutte cup was finally disposed of
last Tuesday on the courts of the Ala
meda Tennis Club, when it became the
property of Miss Emma Hunter. The
winner took the cup three times in suc
cession and thereby proved she is easily
the best lady player in Alameda County.
Miss Hunter's opponent on Tuesday was
Mrs. Klncald, who played an excellent
game, despite the v fact that she was suf
fering with a sprained hand. The match
was pronounced one of the best played
by women in many months. The score
in Miss Hunter's favor was 6 â i, 2â â¬, 6â L
The loser played a strong net game, but
her opponent's swift . chop strokes were
usually out of her reach. By virtue of
this victory Miss Hunter becomes cham
pion of Alameda County for the present
year.
The San Mateo tournament is the first
of the kind ever held in that county, and
will undoubtedly be an interesting event.
Only those will be eligible to enter who
have been residents of San Mateo County
at least two months prior to July 4. The
tournament will commence on the 3d and
fce finished on the following day, when the
final match will be played. A handsome
silver cup has been offered, and must be
v. r on twice successively before becoming
the permanent property of any player.
The Park Tennis Club is planning a
series of doubles tournaments. Two sil
ver cups have been donated and will -be
played for until won three times by one,
team. Only members of the club will be
eligible to play. ;
Iwo important events are scheduled for
the Fourth of July. One will be played
on the Hotel Rafael courts, San Rafael,
and the other on the Hotel Mateo courts,
San Mateo. The former will be a scratch
singles tournament for the State cham
pionship. The State tournament was in
augurated last year and was won by
George F. Whitney. JPlay will begin on
the morning of the 2d and the final match
will be played at 2:30 on the afternoon of
the 4th. There will also be a consolation
doubles for those beaten in their first
match. Valuable prizes have been offered
for both events. George Whitney has .de
cided to enter the singles tournament and
is a strong favorite for championship
honors again this year. Besides the best
players of the California Tennis Club
many of the crack players from the park
and from Alameda County are expected to
enter.
. In\ the first class the cup was won by
Will Allen, the first time and by Charles
Dunlap the [ second time. It is expected
the 'trophy will go to - one of the- two
eventually.- In the second class Kenneth
Marr won the" first tournament and M. C.
Campbell the second. The former did not
play in the last ' tournament, and it ia
doubtful which of the two will win. Grif
fin is improving rapidly and stands a good
chance in this class. - -

LONDON, June 20.â The return of the
rainy weather to-day dampened the spir
its of the occupants of 'the country houses
at Windsor and around Ascot. The at
tendance at the races was in no way com
parable with that of the earlier days of
the meeting.
The Ascot hlghweight stakes was won
by Victor Don, ridden by J. Relff.
Â¦The Duke of Portland's William The
Third (Cannon) won the Alexandra plate;
Osboch (Maher) was second and Amer
Picon (Rigby) third. Six horses started.
The principal race of the day, the Wok
ingham Stakes (handicap for three-year
olds and up, six furlongs), was won by
an outsider, His Lordship. Papdale was
second and Pinnar third. Twenty-five
horses started.
The starting gate refused to act in the
contest for the Wokingham stakes and
only' about half the starters were away
properly and completed the course. There
was some discussion as to whether Â¦ the
race ought to be run again, but the stew
ards decided this was not necessary.
Leopold D. Rothschild, the owner of the
favorite, Vatel, subsequently lodged a
protest against the event* being declared
a race.,. The protest was ' overruled.
Arthur James* colt by St. Serf-EIsted
ford, on which Maher had the mount, won
the Windsor Castle stakes.

Special Referee E. H. Heacock submit
ted his report yesterday, to United States
District Judge de Haven in the case of M.
R. Morgan and others against the Cali
fornia National Bank of San Francisco.
The action was brought for the purpose
of obtaining a distribution of the money
to the stockholders of the bank and of
the funds belonging to the bank in the
hands of T. K. Stateler. : .
The referee decided that Thompson and
Wilson had waived their right to share
in the fund now in the possession of the
agent; that R. P. Thomas was not bound
by the agreement of dismissal in the
stockholders' suit brought by Chetwood;
that R. P. Thomas was at the time of
the failure of. the bank the real owner of
1020 shares of the capital stock, and that
as such real owner he was liable Jointly
with the record owner for the assessment
levied by the Comptroller on the. said 1020
shares.- The referee finds the total In
debtedness to be $24,379 88, which repre
sents the amount to be paid by the.re
maining shareholdersâ that is, 2000 sharea
less the 625 shares owned by Thompson
and Wilson. Each shareholder who has
paid more than $17 73 per share is entitled
to receive back the amount be has paid

team, arrived home this afternoon from
the East, where he went to sign > new
baseball players for his club. Although
a telegram from Ogden last evening said
he passed through that place with four
players, no one left the train in his com
pany this afternoon. When asked for the
names of his new men. Fisher would only
give the name of Stricklett, who, he said,
would be here next week. . He declined
to give the names of the other players,
saying they had to jump Eastern con

were until they had "Jumped."

Corhett-Sullivan Fight Is Off.
DENVER, June 20.â The proposed fight
between Young Corbett and Dave Sulli

Fire and Police Board in forbidding box
ing exhibitions, Manager Gallagher of the
Coliseum Athletic Club paying the $500
forfeit. Later It was . announced that
Corbett and Sullivan have agreed to fight
before the West End Club at St. L,ouis,
July 3. Charles Haughton, president of
the club, is in the city and is said to have
secured the necessary agreement with the
fighters. They are to weigh 127 pounds at
3 o'clock and will fight for 50 per cent of
the receipts, $5000 being guaranteed.

The varsity race for to-morrow is re
garded with great perplexity. If popular
judgment, with but a small proportion of
out-of-town people present, is taken, Cor
nell is the favorite. Up to late this after
noon Pennsylvania and Columbia were
the favorites for second place, but after
to-day's performances Wisconsin has
come rapidly to the front and is looked
upon as a formidable bidder for that po
sition. Some assert that Wisconsin and
Cornell will fight it out for first place in
the varsity race to-morrow. It is under

the picturesque hills and vales, in
plain view of Mount Tamalpals
and a panoramic vista of passing, yachts
upon the bay. The boys of the company
are to be complimented on their gentle
manly behavior. The leading citizens of
Larkspur and vicinity have extended un
bounded hospitality. Last Saturday even
ing the Guards gave an informal enter
tainment in their camp, which more than
200 ladies and gentlemen attended. On
Sunday Colonel O'Neill and staff, in uni
form, visited the camp for inspection,
found it strictly military and commended
the officers and privates for their efficien
cy. Afterward a dinner was partaken of
which would have been a credit to the
best rotisserie in San Francisco.
The company is to give a ball to-morrow
evening in Messner's Hall. Lieutenant W.
W. Kelly is the commanding officer of
the company and is assisted by Lieuten

He was perfectly trained for field shoot

On Sunday, while in a field near his
owner's home at Belmont, he was bitten
by a rattlesnake. There was a slight
swelling, to which Mr. Bourdette paid but
little attention at the time, thinking it was
the sting of an insect On Monday the
dog was worse and was removed to this
city for treatment by a veterinary sur

lie died. He will be burled on his owner's
place to-day with due honors.

SACRAMENTO, June 20.â Crlstall was
in the box for Oakland to-day. He was
bo deliberate that he drove the spectators
to desperation and nine innings of listless,
insipid ball playing ensued, that sent
half the fans who were present to their
homes before the game was half over.
Umpire McDonald was as slow as the
pitcher and made no apparent endeavor
to hurry the game along. The leaders
won by a score of 4 to 2. Thomas should
not have been allowed to pitch, as lie
has not recovered from his recent illness
and was lacking in control. The game
was featureless. The score:

The stellar attraction of the day was
the ejection of Captain E. Householder
from the lot. It came to pass in the sev
enth round, when the newly elected leader
of the Angels strenuously objected to a
close decision at the first cushion. He
made some vulgar remarks and O'Connell
fined him one five-spot. He persisted in
being eloquent and this time the umpire
ordered him off the grounds. After much
delay and more sulking the premier slug
ger got wise and left the grounds.
The fatal second inning clearly tells the
story of why Morley did not run first. A
base on balls, a sacrifice by Holly, a bats
man hit and four clean singles put six of
the Harris stable over the uncertain hur
dles. Another was added In the sixth on
two costly misplays by Hanlon and An
derson, who both dropped thrown balls
at critical periods.
Hartwell was substituted in the third
and gave a grand exhibition of slab work.
He allowed but a pair of lonely safe
cracks and no one was fortunate in get
ting four of bad quality from him. Per
haps if Hartle began the game a different
story would have to be written about the
result, but many peculiar incidents go to
make ball games and yesterday's struggle
Â¦was no exception.
Elmer Meredith was appointed by Har
ris to puzzle Morley'a all-star bunch and
he had them in the clouds all the time.
He was punched safely only three times
and these were scattered along the line
like milestones in the old country. Hts
control was the best, for he walked but
one man and, strangely enough, this was
the first man up.
to the land of Connie Mack's Phil
lies, ungraciously accepted their third
consecutive drubbing yesterday at the
hands of the Pony stable. The game was
slow and the weather cold. The Ponies
had a cinch on the finish from the second
explosion, when the graceful Oscar. Jones
was good enough to ascend In the direc
tion of the heavens long enough to allow
the locals to ride over the lot for six runs
and four safe binjsrles.

been â which was perpetrated at 3an Francisco

as to put his critics to all the expense and

Tilden or even Jackson himself as to have recalled
Cleveland to the front. For good or for evil Democ
racy has gone forward. Bryanism may be crude and
absurd, but it represents what is vital in the masses
of the party. The reorganizers may be excellent gen
tlemen, but their talk is" a platitude. That much is
made evident by the Tilden' Club speeches. Cleve
land'has been recalled to the front in vain.
In the absence of Bryan, Cleveland and Hill had
everything their own way. x We are told they met
one another cordially and shook hands like .old
friends who are glad to meet again. Their speeches
were harmonious. . Cleveland, as usual, was solemn
and ponderous. Hill was lively and aggressive. The
former President renewed, his.', declarations "against
the tariff and advised another fight for that free trade
which proved so disastrous under his last term. Hill
was equally insistent upon that issue, but added to it
an attack upon the Republican administration '" in
Cuba. Cleveland, amid cries of "No, no," declared
himself permanently'out of politics. Hill gave no
tice that he was still in the ring. That was the net
result of the great banquet.
Bryan was invited tc the T(lden Club banquet, but
he did. not attend, neither did he deign to make a re
ply. His conduct was not unnatural; for the club in
inviting him had not included him among'the speak
ers. A man who has twice been the leader of his
party in a Presidential contest and who has polled a
larger popular vote than any other. Democrat can
hardly have failed to perceive an intentional slur in an
invitation to attend a notable gathering of. his' party
at which he was to b t given a back seat and denied
the right of Speaking upon the party policies.
It is useless to speculate as to which of the two fac
tions represents the dominant element in the Demo
cratic party. We shall not know that until they meet
for the decisive struggle in the national convention
in 1904. There- can be no question, however, that
present appearances tend to the conclusion that
Bryan is discredited in his own camp while Cleveland
has regained much of his ; former prestige. The
Democratic State conventions of the year have been
silent on the points of issue between the factions, but
that silence is seemingly a victory for Cleveland. The
Chicago and Kansas City platforms have not been re
pudiated, but at the same time they have not been re
affirmed. Virtually they have been abandoned, and
with them appears to have gone the leadership of the
man personally identified with them.
SOME days ago Bryan was reported to have
written to a Populist that he intends to do all
.in his power to "aid 'those who are determined
to prevent the Clevelandizing of the Democratic
party." There, can be no question that in coining the
word "Clevelandizing"; Mr. Bryan thought he was
inventing a term that would rouse antagonism to the
reorganized by exciting against them all the popu
lar prejudices supposed to exist, against Cleveland:
It is therefore a curious fact that just at this juncture
the reorganizers shbuld hpe invited Qeveland to be
the chief guest and speaker at a"grand banquet ar
ranged for the purpose of promoting the reorganiza
tion movement. It appears, then, that there is the
widest possible difference of opinion between the
Bryanites and the reorganizers concerning the per
sonal influence^ofthe ex-President and the effect of
his name. What Bryan, uses as a term of denuncia
tion the other faction uses as a spell with which to'
restore courage to the Democratic camp.
Should there be no agreement at this session the
people will insist that^the measure be made the chief
subject of legislation next winter. Having now
come within sight of an isthmian canal bill, public in
terest in the measure will be keenly excited until the
route is definitely decided and the great enterprise is
begun. Under such circumstances delay further than
next winter is hardly to be accounted among the
possibilities of legislation. The country, therefore,
will be fairly content with the Spooner bill. It is a
step toward an end which cannot now be very far
off. We shall have the canal, and a Republican Con
gress will have the honor of inaugurating the great
work. .
Because the House passed the Nicaragua bill
by a virtually unanimous vote, it has been taken for
granted that it will never agree to the Spooner
amendment, which provides for a canal by that route
only upon condition that the President cannot make
satisfactory arrangements for the Panama route. It
is to be borne in mind, however, that the House bill
was passed before, the latest offer was made by the
Panama, company, and that the situation was then
quite. different from 1 what it is to-day. Had the
same terms been before the House as have been be
fore the Senate! . it is quite likely there would have
been a strong support to Panama in that body. Con
sequently the prospects for an agreement between
the two houses are by no means so dark as they, ap
pear at first glance.
Had the Nicaragua men in the Senate succeeded
in procuring the passage of the House bill the meas
ure would now..h4ve gone to the President and the
beginning of the work would be in sight. The* adop
tion'of the" Spooner amendment forfeits that "advan
tage. The Senate bill must now go. back to the
House, and possibly it may be held up there for the
rest of the session. That would mean perhaps a
year or more of delay, and would carry disappoint
ment to the public- Still even under those terms the
result is not so bad as it. might have been. Some
thing at least has been achieved. The promise of the
Republican platform to provide for an isthmian
canal has been partially fulfilled, and it is not likely
that a Republican House and a Republican Senate
Will fail to reach some, basis upon which they can
come together in agreement and fulfill the pledge
completely.
WITH the exception of the comparatively
small class who upon the isthmian canal
question have . bewi for "Nicaragua or
nothing" the American people will be well content
with the passage of the Spooner bill by the Senate.
If it be not all that was hoped for in the early days of
the session, it is much better than has been feared to
some extent in the later days. . . There have been
times when it seemed quite probable that the division
of the, supporters of the canal 'between the two
routes would enable the opponents of the enterprise
; lo virtually; defeat" it by bringing about a prolonged
deadlock. That danger is no longer threatening.

prejudice among the people of the State and
frightening them into the belief that a greut

wealth â the danger of a newspaper despotism;
the danger of government by newspapers In

against; it comes from Governor Gags, hia

"Dan" Kevane stripe, joined in and repeated,
parrot-like, by that small portion of the
thoughtless and irresponsible press which does
not even stop long enough to consider that in
repeating such a cry it is degrading its own
profession and lowering the standard of dignity,
honor and integrity which should characterize
a free, brave and honest press.
This talk about a "newspaper triumvirate"
is the baldest sort of bald nonsensa.
VISAT.TA TIMES:
The Call made a political mistake when it
accused Governor Gage of dishonesty and the
Governor will find that he gained no sympathy
when he brought hi3 suit for libel In an ob
scure township in Los Angeles County. The
public wants this casa tried promptly, and It
should have been brought In some court whera
the records of the State Controller and of San
Quentin could have, been easily and quickly
obtained.
SAK" BERNARDINO SUN":
If John D. Spreckels had secretly fled to
Honolulu, as some of the newspapers reported.
It would have been the biggest feather in Gov
ernor Gage's cap in the tail of hia opponent's
rooster. But Spreckels has not fled, and what's
more he is not .going to flee. . 1* his paper.
The Call, he reiterates" all his charge* against
Gage, says he "has him in a hole," and cries
"Lay on. lay on, Macduff, and damned bÂ« hÂ»
who first cries Hold, enough!" Oh, U'Â« going
to be a beaut of a scrimmage.
UKTATT DISPATCH-DEMOCRAT:
It turns out that Governor Gage's threat of
arrest and criminal prosecution of John D.
Spreckels and Sam Leake of The Call, which
so tickled the Gage press last week, has not
frightened these gentlemen in the least. Tues
day's Call reiterates the charges already made,
and adds the very s' icus charge that for tha
preceding week Gage had been at San Quentin
holding a "star chamber" investigation behind
locked doors and forcing employes and inmates
of the prison to sign and swear to depositions
and affidavits to flx up a whitewash. Governor
Gage never In his life made so great a mistake
as he did in going to San Quentin to make his
secret investigation. It proves that he either
had a guilty knowledge of crookedness or a
strong suspicion that The Call's charges were
true and that he wished to cover something up.
IilVEBMOBE HERALD:
i.ne t,au s expose or the mismanagement and
corruption at San Quentin prison will put an
end to Governor Gage's hopes for a renomin
ation. The Governor was weak before -with
the rank and file of his party and now evea
the leaders who were attempting to force his
nomination will probably decline the added re
sponsibility of apologizing for the sins of
Gage's political household.
POMONA' PROGRESS:
The people are not so much concerned about
the damage suits â the courts will take carÂ®
of them â as they are about getting at tha
truth regarding The Call'3 charges. The latter
has invited prompt investigation and haa al
leged that it is ready to prove all the charges
that it has made, and to produce a good deal
more evidence than It has told the people
about. The duty surely rests upon the Prison
Board to investigate, at once and thoroughly,
the administration of San Quentin and inform
the people regarding it.

It has come rather as a surprise to the
literary world that Gabriel Setoun. who

This issue is raised in the Melrose incident. The
mechanics freely entered into a contract which
extralega^ compulsion may compel them to. .break.
If the firm which employs them, when it came to
begin building the tanks, "had found that' it could
employ men for a half-dollar a day less' than it had
contracted to pay them, and had turned them adrift
and employed labor at lower wages, the courts
would have protected the wage-workers by enforcing
the contract. But when the shoe is on the other foot,
and the men repudiate a contract voluntarily made,
if the courts attempt to compel them to fulfill their
contract it is regarded by their organization as judi
cial compulsion upon their labor, and then it is said
that a man cannot be compelled to work, the morality
of the matter being lost sight of. The employe^
however, can be compelled to pay the men the wages
agreed upon for the full time of the contract, whether
they work or not If he hire cheaper labor to do the
work and pay it, he must still pay under his contract
the wages agreed upon to the men with whom he
contracted. A contractor must be responsible. The
I^rice he is to receive for his job is open-to the judg
ment of the court on his contract, i ' .
It will be seen that contracts cannot long, be so
one-sided. The employer will not long consent to be
considered the only responsible party to contracts
and the organizations of employes which insist. upon
enforcement of contract against the employer, "and
with equal force insist that the employe shall be as
free to violate his contract as he is to make it, are
teaching a lesson and establishing a principle of
vÂ»fcich they will finally be the victim* 1
To none is this freedom of contract more neces
sary than to the wage-earner. He enforces the pay
ment of his wages by resort to the courts, which im
ply a contract between him and his employer, into
which both freely entered. As the appearance of
compulsion in making a contract would destroy per
sonal liberty and imperil political freedom, what is to
be said of compulsory violation of contract?
The right of contract is the most necessary right
enjoyed by man. In its very nature it is free. Our
laws protect freedom of contract, an<jl the idea . of
compulsory contract h so repugnant that no judicial
or legislative body has ever dared promote it. Com
pulsion upon parties to enter into contract implies a
condition of slavery and not of freedom. If men in
considerable numbers surrendered their personal lib
erty so far as to submit to the compulsion of others
in entering into the contractual relation, it might well
be doubted if political freedom could long endure.
That freedom is composed of all the elements that
constitute personal liberty, and these are all included
in freedom of contract. The most important rela
tions of life depend upon this. The state cannot ex
ist without the family. The family depends upon
marriage, and marriage is a contract that must be
freely entered into by the contracting parties. Every
business transaction rests upon actual or implied con
tract. The relation of buyer and seller is contractual,
witnessed by the delivery and receipt of the thing
bought, the receipt of which obligates the receiver to
pay its price. It is freedom of contract in making
the bargain, and when the implied contract is entered
into the courts enforce the contract .-
THE question of validity of contract with skilled
labor is on at Melrose, a suburb of Oakland,
where an Eastern firm that makes a specialty
of such work is building a number of enormous oil
tanks to hold fuel oil. They brought their boiler
makers from the East with them, the men voluntarily
making a contract to work for a certain wage per
day. Upon that basis their employers took the job
of building the great tanks, which will require an oil
train twenty'-three miles long to fill. When the work
got under way the boiler-makers found that they could
get a half-dollar more wages here than in the East,
and as they had entered into a contract to do this
work at the Eastern rate they were ordered to quit
by the union to which they belong, and the work on
the tanks is stopped. The contractor " is appealing
not to the courts to enforce his contract with his
boiler-makers, but to the national headquarters of the
union to order the men to keep their agreement or
not compel him to pay more than they agreed to
work for. 'Â¦" * .
LABOR CONTRACTS.
SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE:
If Governor Gage, in lodging his complaint
against the proprietor and the manager of The
Call in the seaport of Wilmington, sought to
inconvenience the defendants and the witnesses
they will be obliged to summon, he over
reached himself, for it appears that in spite
of the care taken to remove the hearing to a
plac* remote from the State Prison and this
city, whence < most of the evidence in the
case will be derived, his attorneys have so
managed matters that the preliminary exam
ination will take place in San Francisco.
Wo infer this from the fact that the de
fendants, after having warrants served upon
them and giving bonds which Judge Frits ac
cepted, promptly invoked that section of the
Penal Code which reads as follows:
â¢ "S26. - If the defendant is brought before a
magistrate other than the one who issued the
warrant, . the depositions on which the warrant
â¢was granted must bo sent to that magistrate,
or, if they cannot be procure-!, the prosecutor
and his witnesses must be summoned to giv*
their testimony anew." \ .
The attorney of Messrs. Spreckels. and Leake
has already asked that a time bo set for the
preliminary examination of the' defendants for
the' misdemeanor of which they are Accused,
and the Judge has declared his readiness to
hear arguments in the matter. The people Â¦will
note with interest whether Governor Gage is
equally anxious for a epeedy. examination in a
place where evidence is easily obtainable, or
whether he will try to impede progress and
hamper the cause of justice by dragging the
defendants and a multitude of witnesses to
Wilmington, "a proceeding which will result in
expense to the citizens of Los A.ngeles and em
barrassment to the State- Prison Commission,
which will be called upon to submit to on in
vestigation conducted under other auspices and
along ."different lines than those wlHch have' In
the past 'resulted 1 In covering up'a great variety
of irregularities and much downright corrup
tion. Â¦ ' r " , 1 ' -
GOVERNOR GAGE has overreached himself. After three weeks of swaggering delay he caused the arrest of
the proprietor and the manager of The Call on a charge of criminal libel. He is now resorting to every device
of the law to stave of? preliminary examination. The defendants are demanding an immediate trial in a court
within easy reach of State records and witnesses, but Gage is shuffling for an extension of time. The influen
tial independent newspapers of the State know that he is not meeting the true issue in manly style, and they do not
hesitate to express their opinions, as the following comments indicate:
this matter, for Governor Gage has frequently
shown that- he is not amenable to them.
Another point in this connection. Why does
Governor Gage bring that suit hundreds of
miles away from tfce evidence?
The Controller's office and the records at
San Quentin will furnish the evidence for both
sides.
The Governor has not helped his case by
getting away from the evidence.
marysvzl:le democrat:
When Governor Gage announced a determina
tion to commence an action in the courts
against John D. Spreckels and Sam Leake, in
an effor! to convict them of criminal libel, we
had expected to see on earnest move on the
part of the plaintiff along the usual lines of
procedure. But we feel disapplnted in the
action of the Governor and HCicnowledge that
faith In the man has been materially weaken
ed. If Governor Gago is Innocent of complicity
in fraudulent practices at San Quentin prison,
why not meet the issue squarely and at once?
There is an appearance of farce comedy at
tached to the complaint issued out of the office
of a Justice of the Peace in Wilmington Town
ship. Los Angeles County. The records are in
Sacramento or at San Quentin, and so are the
principal witnesses. Does the Governor intend
to compel all witnesses to travel to Wilmington
and back at the expense of the people to vindi
cate his honor?
NAP A REGISTER:
. The San Francisco Call editorially speaks of
the warrants issued at the instance of Governor
Gage for the arrest. of its proprietor upon a
charge of criminal libel. It sees no good reason
for selecting an "obscure township, remote
from the scene of the offense" as the place for
trial. That there will be some contest over this
is intimated la the following . paragraph S
"Whatever be the meaning of the Wilmington
Township move, it matters little. If the courts
decide that Wilmington Township is the place
for the hearing The Call will be ready to meet
the issue. The Call stands by its record. It
will prove the truth of all of its charges and
statements. It meets the prosecution with a
demand for a speedy trial and a full investi
gation."

LO S ANGELES TIMES:
Governor Gage In his ridiculous ante-election
pronunciamento talks as though he would dic
tate to courts and Jurors, and coolly assumes
in advance of a trial that he will "punish" and
"chastise" De Young, Otis, Spreckels and
Leake in the courts. He does not even say
that the punishment shall be with the consent
of the courts, but implies that it shall be by
the will of Governor Gage solely. The Governor
is not the court nor the jury, as he will find
out. Two years ago Governor Gage in his des
peration invented the idea that the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Call and the
Los Angeles Times, with malice prepense and
with the purpose of doing him great political
harm, had constituted themselves a dangerous
newspaper "triumvirate." The idea was purely
an invention of his Excellency's heated imagi
nation. But he exploited the absurd and ground
less charge, and his henchmen and quick
newspaper servants throughout the State re
peated the cry, shouting it from their totter
ing: tripods throughout the commonwealth.
Once for all let the truth be known and the
foolish charge be exploded for good. There la
no newspaper triumvirate, no Journalistic alli
ance, no political partnership between the
newspaper editors and publishers named so far
as the Los Angeles Times has any knowledge
on the subject. Speaking for itself. It can as

GAGE IS SHUFFLING
FOR FURTHER DELAY
Concerning matters of sentiment there can be no dispute. We all love the land of
our birth, the localities where youth was spent and manhoofl begun. Gage, however, is
perhaps the only man that ever lived who would permit sentiment, to dictate to him in a
question of this kind, and who would, refuse to fight even for his ; good name in any place
except one to which he is bound by sentimental ties. It appears indeed to be his resolve
that the place that saw his beginning shall see his finish. His California career began at
San Pedro and there he wishes it to end.
It is just as well that this explanation of Gage's curious course has, been made
public. To all outward appearance " it seemed that the prosecutor in making his com
plaint had sought that far-off point for the purpose of providing a :< rneanl3 of delaying the
trial and preventing a speedy submission of the evidence to the court and to the public.
It is known that the defendants -have been urgent in calling; for an investigation of the
case; that they sought to get the Prison Directors to take it up at, pnee; that they are
eager now to have the examination go forward in the first court in, which it comes up for
a hearing. Consequently the action of the prosecutor in flying from, the scene of the
offenseâ from the place where the 'trial could have been conveniently and speeedily
pressed forward â naturally appears to the public as an evasion. It will therefore come as
a surprise to many to learn from Gage's organ .that he is evading, nothing. -He flies to
the distance solely because in the distance he sees the place where in early years he was
once ; happy. Sentiment rules his gentle breast, and, laying aside, all .'eagerness for a
prompt meeting with those who he says have assailed his good name, he summons
them to meet him there in the sweet by and by. *:<*-:
The issue raised by the sentimental prosecutor is one that merits consideration of
the 'press and indeed of the people generally. If the proprietor and the manager of. The
Call can be compelled to go upward 0/500 miles to stand trial for the purpose of pleas
ing the 'sentiment of the prosecutor, any other citizen of California is liable to the 'same
mishap. â¢ A critic of the Governor may be taken from Siskiyou to San Diego," or from the
mquntainsto the sea, to answer for the criticism, on a complaint of criminal libel, anil
the only reason given for the summons to attend. the far-off' call to 1 , court will be that the
Governor has a sentimental liking for the place because of its : associations -with his early
and innocent years. .' . ;
Under the circumstances the defendants have perhaps good reason to ; feel thankful
that Gage did not begin his California career in Modoc, Inyo or^ome- remote point op
the borders .of Lower California. Since sentiment is to rule in matters of this kind, they
might have had to go farther and find less conveniences than .are afforded at San Pedro.
The excuse is ingenious, and is commended to the attention of the public.
A heavy expense is to be imposed upon the taxpayers of Los Angeles /County because
the .Governor is sentimental. Witnesses and public documents are to be carried hundreds
of miles at great cost and inconveniences solely to gratify the fond feeling of Gage for the
town in which he began his career. It is a case where a tender passion is projected into
an affair of law- and politics, and throws over a prosaic event something of- the glow of
B--Y- the official organ of Henry T. - Gage in this, city the... public ;\vas .informed
yesterday that in making bis complaint against the proprietor and the manager
of The Call at a point far removed from the residence of the defendants and the
homes of the witnesses, Gage was moved by sentimental considerations solely.
The yellow organ asserts:' "The Governor says he siied out the warrants in San Pedro
because of sentiment: It was in that town he began his career in California." , .
FOR SENTIMENT ONLY.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 21, 1902.
6
When the war broke out In South
Africa, it may be remembered, there was
considerable discussion as to Its probable
effect upon the publishers' trade. It
seemed to be generally agreed that it
would be deleterious, if not disastrous,
even when a continuance of war for six
months was not considered likely. Yet it
has lasted more than five times that
period, but nothing haa been heard of any
publisher who has had to file his petition.
As a rule, publishers do not like to say
how much they have suffered, but, how
ever much or little that may have been
the case, all seem to have weathered the
storm remarkably well and are now look-
Ing forward to a boom in the book trade,
which all prophesy.
Publishers are likewise hopeful that be
fore very Ions there will be a considerable
aemand from South Africa for new books
for this reason: "While the war has been
in progress the book trade In South Africa
has necessarily suffered to a very great
extent, and. indeed, its effects have ex
tended to all the British colonies, even to
tar off Australia.
Apart from this, the means of circulat
ing books in South Africa came to a
standstill. For instance, there was no
better, medium for the circulation of
British books than the Rand Club, which
possessed one of the finest and most ex
tensive libraries in South Africa, It will
now have to make up the leeway for near
ly three years' publications. The same re
mark applies to all libraries in South

"I "cannot' do that," said Judge Murasky.
"The members of - the .board have com
plied with the State law by meeting twice
â¢within a year. I fail to .see what power
I have to make the order you suggest."
If the court please, if a continuance is grant
ed it will work a great hardship upon my
clients. The board piay adjourn, and having
complied with the law requiring it to meet
twice a year may not convene' again for several
months. In the meantime these Â¦ young men
will be deprived of their means of making a
livelihood. Suppose you issue an order direct
ing the board to adjourn from day to day until
this matter is decided. 'rr ;: .
Attorney E. Myron Wolfe, who repre

at an early hour yesterday morning: at
his residence, 1505% Market street. The
old man got up from his bed and while
searching for a portion of his clothing
fell through an open window to the
ground, a distance of thirty feet. He was
found - by - persons on their way to work
and sent to the Emergency Hospital,
â¢where Dr. James D. Murphy found both
his legs broken below the knees. His in
juries are of so grave a nature that his
chance for recovery is very small. .

County Assessor Daltpn and Frank J.
Moffitt have had a meeting and . it \ was
brought about because Dal ton wanted it.
Â¦William. E. Dargie, editor of the Tribune
and Moffltt's friend, helped to bring about
the conference and he told how he did
it to-day before the Grand Jury. The
Grand Jury heard about it somewhere
and wanted to get at the bottom of It,
so the editor was called in to furnish
The editor was in his office when the
startling news came over the wire that
Dalton wanted to see him. He went to
the telephone and Dalton asked him how
he could see Moffltt. Moffitt was there,
too, and upon being asked if he had any
objection to seeing Dalton he replied that
he had not. Thereupon he agreed to be
at the corner of Eighth street and Broad
way within three minutes. . .
What came of the meeting is not re
vealed. Dargie saw them talking together,
but didn't hear them talk. It is supposed
that Dalton asked Moffitt to help him out
of his peck of trouble in consideration of
Dalton calling oft the dogs of invective
that have been yelping from the column*
of the Enquirer, not to Moffltt s liking.
At any rate the whole story will come
out when Dalton and Moffltt are Â¦ called
upon to tell what occurred. Dalton was
before the Inquisitors all day and Moffltt
has been summoned to appear next Mon-
The only other new development of the
day was the summoning of Emil Nus
baumer. He did, not go on the stand but
will be there Monday when the Jury meets
again. Russell Stedman, J. B. Lanktree
and Dalton were all recalled, but their
testimony was only wanted to straighten
out some things concerning those missing:

Brandenstein of the Finance
Committee informed the Mayor that the
committee's recommendation of $260,000 for
public lighting, which was accepted by
the Mayor, was- based on a false calcula
tion. The Mayor's cut of $15,000. he said,
would do away with the lighting of street
lamps on three of the five so-called moon
light nights. ' Brandenstein'B explanation
prompted, the Mayor to suggest thÂ© rais
ing of the appropriation to $275 000
.There appears i-to be some doubt as to
the disposition that may. be made of the
$134,000 saved by the. Mayor for public im
provement. Expert Williams thinks the
money may be immediately reapportioned
for streets and sewers. Others hold that
under the charter the money -wlllbe car
ried over uiitil- the end of the fiscal year
and then realpportloned for municipal bet
terments. suggestion â made is
that as the money ; was cut out of the
budget it cannot be ; raised at all Thi3
would result in - a , reduction of about 3
cents in the tax rate or 97 cents on
every $100 assessed ; valuation for~ muni
cipal expenditures. This added to the
park. tax rate would make a total lew of
but $1.0462 for all purposes. y
After holding a conference with the Fi
nance Committee of the Board of Super
visors yesterday Mayor Schmitz decided
to request the .board to Ignore his recom
mendation ' that the sum of $260:000 in
stead of $275,000. be set aside in' the
budget for lighting streets and public
buildings for the next fiscal year. This :s
the item which, the Mayor feels may be
properly restored to the original sum al
lowed by the board. r

SAN JOSE, June 20.â The Elks are
making elaborate preparations for
their circus, whiqh is to be given
* on July 4. Already members are
practicing their "stunts," and
horses, dogs and other domesticated "ani
mals are being trained for the show. The
circus promises to be the greatest ever
held here. Elks never do things by
halves, and the 300 business and profes
sional men who comprise the order in San
Jose declare every one shall enjoy him

bareback riders, trapeze actors, peanut

Judge Seawell made an order directing
that notice of the petition be served on
the grand president and upon the officers
of Genevieve Parlor and set the hearing
for June 27. .
Under the provisions of section 315 of
the Civil Code, Minerva Parlor filed a
petition In the Superior Court yesterday
for a decree annulling the action of the
Grand Parlor in admitting Genevieve
Parlor to membership in the order.
The plaintiffs asked the Grand Parlor
to reject all of the applicants of the so
called Genevieve Parlor and the Grand
Parlcr thought that the violation of the
constitution should be condoned in that
instance and the grand president upheld
upon the ground that it was a question
of fraternity against the law of the or
ganization and that fraterniy ought to
control. It therefore refused to permit
Minerva Parlor to be heard through an
attorney or otherwise. ; â¢
Attorney Stevens contended in his ar
gument yesterday that Minerva Parlor
had no right to bring In an attorney to
plead its case, it being a secret organiza
tion. Attorney Collins, on the other
hand, argued that the authorities showed
that Minerva Parlor had the right to be
represented by counsel. The matter was
submitted on briefs.
As the result of this squabble Mary E.
Tillman and other members of Minerva
Parlor No. 2 filed a petition for a writ
of mandamus to compel the Grand Par
lor to allow an attorney engaged by them
to appear before the Grand Parlor and
argue the question at issue. Attorney
Martin Stevens, in behalf of the Grand
Parlor, filed a demurrer, and It was on
this demurrer that Judge Seawell listened
to arguments yesterday.
The courtroom was crowded with mem
bers of the various parlors interested In
the controversy. Minerva Parlor, through
its attorney, George D. Collins, applied for
a writ of mandamus to compel the Grand
Parlor to hear the application of Gene
vieve Parlor for the annulment of the
charter alleged to have been Illegally Is
sued by the grand president to Genevieve
Parlor.
During the session the doors were
locked, so that the members of Genevieve
Parlor could not be ordered from the hall.
Both factions rested on their arms until
the meeting of the Grand Parlor, which
was held last week. The matter of recog
nizing or rejecting the delegates of Gene
vieve Parlor then came up for action.
The final session of the parent body was
decidedly interesting. The fair delegates
forgot fraternal feelings and charged
each other with nearly every crime in the
decalogue. At one stage it was suggssted
that the police be called in to quell the
disturbance. A telephone message was
sent to a prominent attorney and his ad
vice was asked. He informed the ladies
that it would be unwise to call in police
men.
Despite the action of Minerva Parlor,
Mrs. Baker gathered the rejected members
together in a basement on Clay street and
installed the members in the order.^ Be
ing very modest, Mrs. Baker suggested
that her name be omitted and the par
lor be known as "Genevieve."
Over at South San Francisco, La Ves
pira Parlor holds forth. It is composed of
residents of that section of the city and
up to a year ago Its sessions were re
markable for their calmness. Certain of
the fair ones became dissatisfied with the
policy pursued by their sisters, however,
and there was a small sized revolt. Some
of the members objected to the conduct
of other of ladies and a committee
was appointed to investigate the actions
of those WHo were under the ban. Be
fore this committee could report the mem
bers who were in disfavor withdrew and
proceeded to form a rival parlor. They
applied to the grand president for a
charter but this was denied them, where
upon the dissatisfied faction called upon
Mrs. Genevieve Baker. The leader in
formed Mrs. Baker that as she was a can
didate for the office of grand president,
they would throw many votes her way if
she would promise to grant them a char
ter. The lady made the necessary prom
ise and iri course of time she was elect
ed. She granted the charter and the re
volters honored her by naming their par
lor after her. It is a rule of the Grand
Parlor that a subordinate parlor wishing
to gain admittance must 'be voted upon
by the various other parlors, and in the
event twenty blackballs are cast against
the applicant, siich application will be re
ject 2d. Minerva Parlor, one of the oldest
of its kind in the order, was opposed to
the Genevieve Baker Parlor and every
member of the new society was rejected.
Superior Judge Seawell yesterday lis
tened to arguments in the controversy
of the Native Daughters of the Golden
"West. The question at issue was a purely
legal one and did not involve the interne
cine war that has raged among the mem
bers of the organization. The last session
of the Grand Parlor proved the most ex
citing In the history of thp society. The
sessions being executive, the members
were in duty bound not to divulge what
had taken place, but the debates were
so heated and. the feeling ran so high that
it was Impossible for the ladles to keep
absolutely quiet. As a result members of
the Native Sons and many wlio are not
members of the organization are smiling
at the efforts of the fair sex to govern
themselves.

Parasites Cause All Hair Troubles.
Nine- tenths of the diseases of the/ scalp
and hair are caused by parasite germs.
The importance of this discovery by Pro-
fessor Unna of the Charity Hospital,
Hamburg, Germany, cannot be overesti-
mated. . It explains why ordinary hair
preparations, even of the most expensive
character, fail to cure dandruff; because
they do not and they cannot Kill the dan-
druff germ. The only hair preparation in
tho world that positively destroys the
dandruff parasites that burrow up the
scalp into scales called scurf or dandruff
is Newbro's Herpicide. In addition to its
destroying the dandruff germ Herpicide
is also a delightful hair dressing, making
the hair glossy and soft as silk.

Letter from Miss Georgie Bryan, Sec-
retary of the Social Economic Wo-
man's Club of Memphis, Tenn.
> How nv.riy beautiful young girls develop into worn, listless and hopeless
women simply because sufficient attention has not been paid to their physical
development,. No woman is exempt from physical weakness and periodic
pain, and young- girls Just' budding into womanhood should be carefully
guided physically as well as morally.
V If you know of any young lady who is sick and needs motherly
advice ask her to write to Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass., who will
give her advice free from a source of knowledge which is un-
equalled | in the country. Do not hesitate about stating details
which one may not like to talk about, and which are essential
for a full understanding of the case. ; W V *
MISS GEORGIE BRYAN, 193 Vance St, Memphis, Tenn,
u I can heartily recommend Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound to all young girls, for I have used it myself with the best of
results.
" Last spring I was very much run down and was advised to try it,
which I did; and I was most pleased with its results. The monthly -
aches and pains so common to women, especially distressing in my case,
were all cured by Liydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and I
now always keep it oji hand to help me over sick days."
How Mrs. Pinkham Helped Fannie Kumpe. \/
First Letter. .
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I write for advice in regard to my case.
Menstruation has been coming twice in each month and I have such
pains in my back and limbs and womb, and such hot flushes-^hat ifc
seems as though I would burn up. I have had doctors treat me but
they have done me no good. Can you help me ? " â Miss Fannie Kumpe,
1922 Chester St., Little Rock, Ark. (Sept 10, 1900.)
Second Letter. .
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I feel it is my duty to "write and tellyotf
of the benefit I have derived from your advice and the use of Lydia E,
Pinkham's Vegetable .Compound. The pains in my back and womb
have all left me and my menstrual trouble is corrected. I am very
thankful for the good advice you gave me, and I shall recommend your
medicine to all who suffer from female weakness." â Miss Fanxib
Kumpe, 1922 Chester St., Little Rock, Ark. (Dec. 16, 1900.)
O, my sisters, I do pray you to profit by the experiences of these
women; just as surely as they were cured of troubles, just so
surely will Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound cure every j
woman in the land who suffers from womb troubles, inflammation
of the ovaries, kidney troubles, nervous excitability, nervous pros*
t ration, and all forms of woman's special ills. - rÂ»

The officers have strong evidence that
the assailant of Mrs. Moore Is a promi
nent young man of this city. He wore a
barley sack over his head, with eyeholes
in the sack. He wore no coat. The Sheriff
is positive he has the right man in sight,
and as soon as Mrs. Moore, who is in a
highly excited and nervous state, regains
composure sufficiently to identify the man
he will be placed under arrest. In the
meantime he is being watched closely.
NEVADA, June 20.â Additional facts re
garding the attack upon Mrs. Elihu
Moore several nights ago are being
brought to light. Instead of having been
attacked but once, as was at first report
ed, Mrs. Moore was set upon twice the
same day â once early In - the afternoon and
again late at night. The daylight attack
was made at a lonely spot on a road far
from observation. Mrs. Moore at that
time succeeded in eluding her . assailant,
but when attacked at night he managed
to catch her, and only after a desperate
struggle did she escape.

OF MRS. MOORE
The City Council of Eureka and others
of Hurnboldt County have been served
with an injunction and restraining order
b>-^nlted States Circuit Judge Morrow on
the petition of the Sunset Telephone and
Telegraph Company during the pendency
of the suit of the company against the
City Council,
The complaint, which, was filed in the
United States Circuit Court, alleges that
A. C. Dauphiny, H. A. Poland and Frank
Zeigler, a majority of the City Council,
conspired- for the purpose of extortion
and gain and made certain extortionate
demands for money to -.be paid by the
company for and on behalf of themselves
and their associates; that the amount so
demanded was $4000; that the company
was then advised that if it refused to
pay the same it would not obtain per
mission from the City Council to erect
any more poles in Eureka; that its taxes
would be increased and that its rates for
telephone service would be reduced about
one-half. It is alleged further that . the
telephone company refused to pay this
sum of money, and that In consequence
of said refusal the application of the com
pany was continued and "delayed without
action by Dauphiny, Poland and Zeigler
until March 18, 1902, when it was denied
by their votes, no reason being given for
eucn denial. It is iurther alleged that
pending the disposition of said applica
tion the company was informed by the
respondents that no further permission
would be granted to erect poles in the
city of Eureka until the aforesaid money
arrangement was made with them, and the
company was referred to an intermediary
by said respondents, by and through
whom such arrangements might be ef
fected. " â¢ .
It is further alleged that in pursuance
of said scheme to extort from, the com
pany Dauphiny, Poland and Zeigler pro
cured to be passed by tne Council on
January 27, 1902, two ordinances, numbered
Â£85 and 286, to take the place of ordin
ances 250 and 260, on the pretext that the
latter ordinances were void. The com
plainants allege that the new ordinances
are In violation of the . interstate com
merce act, and that the City Council 1b
planning to remove the poles as a nuis
ance, and that they procured the arrest
of A. E. McLaren, superintendent of the
company, on a charge of misdemeanor
for maintaining the poles on the streets,
which case Is now pending in the Police
Court. .
Complainant alleges also that Dau-
Ehiny, Poland and Zeigler will direct the
uperlntendent of Streets, J. F. Thomas,
to tear down and remove the poles, which
would result in great damage to the' tele
phone company. It Is further f averred
that the rates to be charged by the com
pany and fixed by the ordinances are too
low and would result, if enforced, in the
destruction of the property of the com
pany.

One More Toy Pistol Victim.
To the already extensive list of toy pis
tol victims there was one more recorded
yesterday in the person of Charles Bar
rett, aged 11 years, who lives at 9 Rausch
street. Barrett, in order to be on time
for the coming Fourth, bought a toy pis
toi and tried it. He is now satisfied that
the pistol will work if properly handled.
A small-sized bullet was cut 'out of thd
palm of his left hand by Dr. Bunnell.
A bottle was found on the Cliff House
beach yesterday containing a scrap of pa
per, on which was written in pencil a note
signed Charles Cohen, stating that the
writer intended to commit suicide and
that his body would be found in the brush
near the "Wheelman's Rest. Police
searched the spot, but were unable to find
any body. They arrived at the conclusion
that the note was a hoax.
Probably a Hoax.

THIRTT-THIBD DISTRICT.
The Republican Primary League urges its
members and citizens in general to register
immediately. ,
The first object of this organization Is to
interest citizens In political affairs, and urge
them to a full -performance of their duties.
The Governorship, the highest and most im
portant office In the State, is involved in the
coming primary election.
' No man discharges his duties s as a citizen
and elector who fails to vote at a primary
honestly conducted. Under the present primary
law the votes are honestly counted and here
the citizen has an opportunity to express his
preference as to the men who shall name the
ticket for which he votes. If he votes for
liberal and fair men at the primary they will
name representative candidates; if he votes
at the primary for corrupt men, corruption
will result. â¢ ,
The Republican Primary League only desires
a full and fair expression of the people's will,
which in the coming primary may be effectively
shown for the best interests of the State and
party; we therefore request all citizens to
register and take part in the coming primary
election.
E. B. Edson of Gazelle, Slskiyou Coun
ty, is allowing his cattle on a thousand
hills to graze for themselves while he
journeys about the State looking after his
political fences. Edson is not disturbed
by the doings of other candidates. He
possesses a good sense of humor which
helps him cut In the campaign. The other
day at the Union League Club he was ac
costed in this style.
"How's your campaign, Edson?
"Going along all right," was the. reply.
"How do you and Gage get along? Is
the Governor fighting you?"
"He is not making a bitter fight, said
Edson. "It's only the old antagonism be
tween cattlemen and sheepmen."
The Board of Directors of the Republi
can Primary League met last evening and
considered the subject of registration.
The following resolution was adopted by
the Board:
The great demonstration accorded to
Eugene E. Schmitz at gtockton has en
raged the Gage push of San Franciscp
and Los Angeles. The Gage organs in the
south throw discretion to the winds and
in their mad frenzy speak of Schmitz
as the "fiddling Mayor of San Francisco,"
The Gage organette in San Francisco does
not attack the Mayor personally for ad
dressing fellow Californians at Stockton,
but it Hies into a rage when the Primary
League is mentioned.

Surgeon Bunnell Asks Chief
of Police to Disarm Young
San Francisco.
The coming Fourth of July is casting a
shadow so sharp and black over the rec
ords of the city receiving hospitals that
Chief Surgeon Bunnell has been con
strained to invoke the aid of Chief of Po
lice Wittman in the task of disarming the
email boy.
The approaching celebration of Indepen
dence day has aroused Young San Fran
cisco's lust for warlike noise. Enterpris
ing dealers in Fourth of July equipment
have placed within the reach of the poor
est simple means for satisfying to the
limit this desire for martial disturbance.
Nothing appeals to Young America
with as much eloquence as does the pos
session of a. pistol. The pistol of com
merce is a luxury beyond the means of
the average youngster. Since war times
have familiarized the small boy with real
pistols nothing but a real pistol or a good
working imitation will satisfy him when
it comes to celebratng the glorious
Fourth. He has been provided with both.
The real pistol he has obtained, surrep
titiously perhaps, but he has it and
has used It. The imitation or toy pistol
he can obtain in exchange for a few cents
and it is a poor specimen of a boy that
cannot rustle money in a cause of such
vital interest.
So far as the small boy is concerned
both pistols are equally deadly, and it is
against this weapon in any form that
Chief Surgeon Bunnell has decided to go
to war.
"It's the boy that packs a gun that
makes us work," says Bunnelh "and I
have asked Chief of Police Wittman to
save these juvenile but sanguinary cele
brants from themselves."
DEADLY EXECUTION.
The records of the Central Emergency
Hospital > and of the Harbor Receiving
Hospital give some idea as to the deadly
execution already wrought by the toy pis
tol, and there is hardly a drugstore ;in
the city or a physician with family
practice that has not been called upon
within the last few weeks to repair the
havoc wrought by a misplaced explosion
of gunpowder.
At the Central Emergency Hospital dur
ing this month up to noon of yesterday
twenty-five small boys have been treated
for gunshot wounds and powder burns,
and similar cases at the Harbor Hospital
number a round dozen.
"Gunshot wound of the left hand" is the
way the record reads in most cases and
all the wounds have been more or less se
rious. In some cases Inquisitive fingers
have been torn away and in others good,
useful ej"es have been placed permanent
ly on the retired list.
The principal danger, according to Dr.
Bunnell and his assistant surgeons, Is
from blood poisoning. Both the real and
the toy pistols shoot blank cartridges.
The powder in these is held in place by' a
wad. When this wad strikes at close
range a soft surface, such as the disen
gaged hand of a smaTl boj r , it makes an
entrance and carries into the wound all
its own impurities, together with every
thing in the way of real estate that may
have previously accumulated on the
youngster's hand. As no self-respecting
boy engaged in the serious work of cele
brating the Fourth of July ever has clean
hands, this latter accumulation is gener
ally considerable and sometimes of a dan
gerous nature when introduced under the
skin.
The real danger, say the hospital sur
geons, is from blood poisoning and lock
jaw. Some apparently simple wounds
have developed serious complications.
THIBT^-SEVEN mJTTBED.
The toy pistol is responsible for nearly
every case treated at the city hospitals.
The Fourth of July Is two weeks away,
bet during this month alone thirty-seven
small boys have sustained injury from
these warlike playthings.
Included in these thirty-seven cases is
one repeater, and each visit to the hospi
tal cost the victim a finger. Prior to the
first visit the youngster took a shot with
a blank cartridge at the index finger of
his left hand. He shattered the digit and
ran bleeding and howling to his mother,
who confiscated and destroyed the pistol
before taking the young warrior to the
Harbor Hospital. Two days later he was
back at the hospital with another finger
in ribbons. Mother had relented her con
fiscation judgment and to console Willie
for his suffering had bought him a new
pistol.
Chief Surgeon Bunnell has asked the
Chief of Police to regulate the placing of
these deadly weapons in immature hands.
He also issues a Â¦warning to parents.
Every one of the thirty-seven cases
treated this month represents, the doctor
Bays, weeks cf careful dressing and nurs
ing. Borne of the cases may have fatal
ending. In many of them the mutilation
Is considerable and in nearly all' of them
the scars will be permanent.
If you value your youngster, say all the
doctors, don't place him In danger of
blood poisoning, lockjaw and death by
giving him as a plaything a deadly toy
pistol.
TO DECIDE UPON
POLICY BY VOTE
Merchants^ Association
Debates the License
Question.
Rates Are Very Much Lower
in. This City Than
Elsewhere.
The board of directors of tne Mer
chants* Association is seriously corisin
erlng the advisability of advocating,
among other municipal improvements a
decided increase in the cost of retail
liquor licenses. The number of saloons
in San Francisco in v proportion to tne
population is shown to be greater than
in any other important city in the Â£nÂ»ed
States. In most Eastern cities it is i con
sJdered that the revenue from the sale or
liquors should wholly, or almost wholly
pay for police protection. In =Â»Â»".* r Â£}_
Sisco the amount of money annually ae
rived by the city from saloons is *^Â£-;
The cost of maintenance of tno Foiu-
Departmennis $884,461. It has been deter
mined to find out the opinion of a.ma
jority of the members of the association,
and voting cards have been distributed
on which are the following questions.
(1) Do you favor increasing the retail liquor
license^ rf n
num here? (The average rate for other large
cities In California Is nearly $400 per annum).
(3) If not, what do jou favor?
(4) Do you favor a graded license instead or
a flat rate? .
A table of the rates of licenses In Pa
cific Coast cities shows that the cost per
annum of retailing liquors is $1000 'in
Seattle, $600 in Los Angeles, $400 in Port
land, dr., and Oakland and $300 or more
in Fresno, San Jose and -Sacramento, in
certain Massachusetts cities the rate
ranges from $2000 to $2500. With the not
ing cards and tables the following reso
lutions, adopted by the directors of the
association at the monthly meeting on
May 28, have been sent to each member.
Whereas If the city of San Francisco is to
maintain its place among its sister cities i, it
must be quick to adopt the methods these
other cities have found to be wise and efnca
ck-us. In a word. It must be conducted upon
the Iine3 of the progressive cities of the
Union. The Merchants' Association would be
derelict in its duty and false to its Purpose
did it not advocate for San Francisco all that
the great cities of the Union have found to be
efficacious for the upbuilding of their munici
palities and for the benefit of their citizens;
and
Wherea3 One of the most important points
of difference that now exists between San
Francisco and these other Ieaittng cities is the
exceedingly low rate of retail liquor license
that 13 now in force in this municipality. Sta
tistics show that this license rate is start
lingly less than that of almost any other city
in the United States; and
Whereas, Considering that al! the other great
cities of the nation have found it to their best
interest to establish and maintain a rate of
license far in excess of that prevailing in the
city of San Francisco; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the board of directors of the
Merchants' Association is hereby requested to
ascertain the views of the whole association
by a postal vote of all its members on this
most important question, and thereupon act
in harmony with the views expressed by the
majority vote.
Recovers Penalty.
The suit of John A. Marshall for $360
against F. A. Williams and the Regents
of the University of California was de
cided in favor of the plaintiff yesterday.
Marshall while working on State con
tracts worked nine laborers more than
eight hours a day for four days, and Con
tractor Williams and the Regents with
held $360 as a penalty from the amount
due him. Many other suits have resulted
in similar verdicts.
1" HE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 21, 1902
The committee then elected Dr.- Ira Dal
ziel to \ succeed Major Filmer- as grand
marshal.'
Another meeting, will be held next Tues
day afternoon. It was decided not to hold
a night parade and the plan to- have a
night illumination of the city was also
abandoned, r --â¢â¢.â --
Walter .H. Gallagher Immediately mov
ed that the resignation be accepted. A
vote -was then taken and Mr. Filmer's
name was withdrawn. Rabbi Levy then
arose and made a fitting and well worded
speech, carefully touching both' sides of
the Question, and this did much to ease
the feelings of the rival factions, j Dr:
Levy- dwelt on the honorable traits and
high standard of Major miner's charac
ter and paid him a. worthy tribute. He
added that he regretted the fact that any
ill-feeling existed and hoped that both
sides would be satisfied with the arrange
ments for the celebration.
- The committee In charge of the Fourth
of July celebration in this city is having
trouble 'trying to arrange, the patriotic
exercises to suit all classes of people who
are anxious to see the national holiday
fittingly observed. The cause of the pres
ent dispute is the appointing of a grand
marshal, and the representatives of two
prominent labor unions figure conspicu
ously in the difficulty.
The Fourth of July committee met at
the California Hotel yesterday afternoon,
Chairman Bruce Cornwall presiding. Wil
liam J. White of the Typographical Union
was on hand to object to Major Filmer,
who had been chosen grand marshal at
a previous meeting, on the ground that he
was a member of Filmer Bros., electro
typers, a non-union firm. White was back
ed by Michael Coffey of the Hackmen's
Union and a member of the Fourth of
July committee. '
White was first to voice his objections.
He said if Filmer was permitted to act as
marshal all labor organizations would
withhold their support from the celebra
tion. Coffey said that if Filmer's name
was not withdrawn no- cabs or hacks
would be allowed in the Fourth of July
parade.
Chairman Cornwall and other members
of the committee questioned White and
Coffey as to their objections. Â¦
Chairman Cornwall explained that Mr.
Filmer was elected grand marshal be
cause he was a man of sterling 1 character,'
a prominent member of the National
Guard, formerly a major in the First Cal
ifornia volunteers, having gone with them
to the Philippines, a prominent Native
Son and better suited to perform the du
ties of grand marshal than any one else
whose name had been presented. Mr.
Cornwall added that Mr. Filmer's busir
ness affairs were not thought of when he
was .chosen, simply his ability to do the
city and her citizens justice.
Chairman Cornwall then offered Mr. Fil
mer's * resignation/ acting for the latter,
as he is a personal friend, and the major
being out of town Prevented j his appear
ing. A

CAPTURE A SUPPOSED
ASSAILANT OF WOMEN
Los Angeles Police Believe They
Have Brutal Thug Wanted for
Many Crimes.
LOS ANGELES, June 20.â John alias
"Bull" White, a notorious character, was
arrested this morning on suspicion of be
ir.g the perpetrator of a series of fiendish
crimes. Within a few weeks three women
have been brutally attacked on the

years, residing Â¦with her son at 18 South

HARMONY EXISTS IN ELKDOM
Oakland and San Francisco Lodges
Will Jointly Celebrate To-Night
The story of ill-feeling existing between
the members of Oakland Lodge and San
Francisco Lodge No. 3 is entirely myth
ical. Never in the history of Elkdom
have two herds browsed together in such
harmony, and to-night there will, be such
a display of good fellowship that even
those who got jammed ti&d squeezed a
little bit last Monday night will forget
their so-called kick . and "lock horns'*
with ' their brothers from across the bay
in a manner that will forever set at rest
all rumors of discontent.
Past Exalted Ruler Harry Melvln and
Frank Leavitt of Oakland Lodge visited
the local lodge last night and received a
welcome that put to shame even the far
famed "glad hand" usually extended vis
iting brothers. They completed arrange
ments for the love' feast to-night, and
were promised hearty support by the local
Elks.
A special boat has been chartered to
carry every Elk in this city and the friend
of every Elk to Oakland, where they will
be met by a special train and conveyed
to Broadway station. A brass band and
a special committee of Oakland Elks will
meet them at Broadway and escort them
to the carnival grounds. Transportation
and admission to the grounds will be pre
sented to every one affiliated with the
Elks of this city by the Oakland Lodge.
The special boat will leave this side of
tbe bay at 7:45 p. m.
The eagerness displayed last night by
the local Elks to join with their Oakland
brothers proved a great source of satis
faction to Melvln and Leavltt, and proves
conclusively that the rumors of ill-feel
ing toward the Oakland Lodge are entire
ly without foundation.

Utah Youth Injured and Almost

son Jr., the youth who was kidnaped Sun
day night, returned to his home at 1:20
this morning In an almost fainting con

time.' Young Anderson claims that when
on his way to the farm early Monday
morning he was. held up, just outside the
city limits by three masked men, who
commanded him to throw up his hands,
at the same time placing revolvers at his
face. Anderson says he was so excited
he failed to put up his hands, whereupon
one of the. men struck him on the head
with some blunt Instrument and he knew
no more until just before dusk last even
ing, when he found himself lying in a cave
up on the mountains east of Brigham.
Hearing voices outside he kept very quiet
and heard the men discussing the chances
of getting the $500& they had. demanded
In the note left at the Anderson home.
A short time, afterward the men left the
mouth of the cave and Anderson escaped.

John Shaw Is Accused of Stealing a
Purse From Woman Whose Life
He Had Threatened.

she was married. She says he then re
minded her of his former threat and be
fore she could prevent it he cut the straps

LONDON, June 20.â The British ship
ping combination which intends to com

North Atlantic and Pacific freight and
passenger business is now practically con
summated. Many reports of the forma

curate, have appeared in the last week.
To-day the following, details were
learned: Sir Christopher Furness Is to be
the head of the new combination. It Is
to be capitalized at Â£20,000,000. The Cun
ard Company is included In the deal. The
British Government has agreed largely to
increase the present subsfrtles, while Can
ada 'promises at * least~Â£l,000,000 yearly.
Six large passenger boats, capable of
twenty-five knots an hour, are to be built,
also a dozen sixteen-knot freighters, at
an aggregate cost of Â£8,500,000. The entire
capital has been underwritten. One well
known capitalist, who offered to take up
a big block of the stock, was told that
the whole amount had been subscribed.
In the mlndsNif those who support the
scheme, the Atlantic aspect is not greater
than the Pacific. The main Idea is the
utilization of the Canadian Pacific rail
road as the chief link in the chain bring
ing Australia. 'India, .China and Japan

England and providing an all-British

DECLARES ADMIRALTY
SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE
Bear Admiral Beresford . Protests
Against Methods in Vogue in
- the British Navy. Â» .
LONDON, June 20.â During the discus
sion of the navy estimates. in the, House
of Commons, to-day, Rear Admiral
Charles Beresford, Conservative, : scath
ingly criticized the deficiencies" of the
navy. He declared the. whole Admiralty
system was rotten and led to great ex
travagance, and that there was a general
want of efficiency in the navy, on which
depended the existence of the empire.
This was the judgment of all the commis
sion's of inquiry and had been proven a
fact. Every increase in the number of
ships and every improvement in them had
been the result of outside agitation. As
a result of such agitation the British
Mediterranean fleet was now a fourth
stronger than a year ago. It is remark
able Lord Beresford added, that both
army and navy officers were compelled to
threaten to resign in order to get things
righted. Great Britain had only 20,000
naval reserves Instead of the requisite
80,000, and the engine-room departments
were thousands of men short. As to arm
ament, both the United States and France
possessed superior guns. Blunders' would
continue until a separate board was ap
pointed at the Admiralty and was made
responsible for the efficiency of the fleet.
Treasury control was fatal to efficiency.
As an instance, the speaker pointed out
the case of Sir William Vernon Harcourt,
Â¦who,' when Chancellor of the Excheauer.
put his-pen through the ammunition sup
plies after the guns had been ordered.
In the afternoon the conference voted to
take a drive to-morrow morning through
the vineyards, as arranged by the local
committee.
The principal sermon of the morning
was by Dr. John Robbin of Georgia, who
preached on "The Golden Rule."
As an illustration of what mission work
had accomplished, the next number on the
programme came in very nicely, being- a
song by Mrs. Lee Mow, a Chinese lady
who has attended the mission in this city.
Following her was a chorus by students
of the Chinese missions. Dr. Kem, also
of the mission, sang a solo and responded
to an encore. The chorus again sang,
one selection being in English and another

"I was like paper in that man's hands,"
said Striker to-day, when describing his
experience. "He had the strength of a
lion and I the strength of- a cat. It's a
wonder he didn't kill me."
At Port Costa State policemen were
called in to help Striken They tied him
down with a bell rope and then sat on
him. Still the man struggled and by the
time Stockton was reached his wrists were
worn to the bone from the handcuffs.
The passengers, fearful of the result ol
the fight, hurriedly deserted the car and
Striker was left alone to conquer if he
could. He fought to keep the maniac
stretched between two seats, but he was
unequal to the battle against superhuman
strength. At last Striker succeeded in
putting handcuffs on the man's wrists and
holding him down in the seat. This was
accomplished only after the madman had
slashed his throat with a piece of glass.
The car was covered with spattered blood.
Striker tried to quiet the man, but just
after leaving Sixteenth street station he
butted his head through the window.
When Striker jumped on him he kicked
a hole through another window. In the

kicked two seats out of their sockets.

Richardson was the man who walked
into the police station two days ago and
informed Officer Curtis that he was likely
to kill himself or somebody else. At

Brown's body was not found until this
morning, when It was picked up by trav
elers. A short distance below were six
of the horses, together with the wagon.
The leaders could not be found. As the
grades in that country are quite steep,
it is supposed that the animals in their
mad flight down the mountain road
slipped and dashed over the precipice.
Brown left a young wife, whom he had
married but a few months ago. He was
a native of Forest City and 23 years of
age.
NEVADA, June 20.â Hiram Brown, one
of the^ best known teamsters in Sierra
and Nevada counties, met an awiul
death yesterday afternoon. He was
thrown from a heavily laden elgtit-horse
ore wagon and crushed under the mas
sive wheels. Brown left Forest City with
a load of sulphureta early yesterday
morning. When four miles out on the
road to Nevada City the lead chain hold
ing: the two front horses snapped in two,
the ends striking the animals' heels and
scaring them. The horses made a fran
tic effort to break away, but the brave
driver clung to the lines until he was
pulled from his seat with the reins
wrapped around his body. He fell di
rectly in front of the ponderous wheels,
which passed over his body.

POSTUM CEREAL. '
COFFEE SENSE.
To Drink, or Not to Drink, the Ques-
tion.
A prominent St. Paul woman comments
on coffee as follows:
"While I was drinking coffee I was
troubled with sleeplessness and palpitation
of the heart. I began to feel suspicious
of coffee poison and having no desire to
drug myself, realizing how inconsistent
it was for me to continue the use of any-
thing that helped to break .me down, so
I <jult coffee and began using Postum
Coffee.
"Now I sleep well and consequently feel
rtfreshfed, and am much strengthened.
Palpitation of the heart has ceased and
altogether life seems worth living.
"Some of our family like a little coffee
jaixed in with the Postum; that, of
oourse. Is much healthier than the old
fashioned coffee alone.".
It is true that very strong coffee of the
best flavor has a little more fascinating
taste to some palates chan pure Postum.
On the other hand, there are thousands
of people that prefer the flavor of Postum
pure and simple. If coffee agrees per-
fectly, and people are not 111 in any way,
there eeems no good reason why coffee
Ehould be discontinued unless there Is
a fear of disease finally setting up from
the continued use of a drug. On the
other hand, if any member of a family
is ailing in stomach, bowels, kidneys,
eyes, or the nervous system, such a one
Ehould immediately quit ordinary coffee
and take Postum Food Coffee. A sure
result can be depended upon and a grad-
ual feeling of health and strength will
come from the change. Health, of course,
is worth almost everything on earth. *
Some people are go constituted that it
Is hard for them to give up a habit even
if cood health is the reward, but it Is
perfectly easy to â¢ leave off coffee when
one can have a well boiled cup of PoÂ»-
tum In its place.Movements of Steamers.

THAT the British ship Monkbarns, |
-which arrived yesterday, 149 days
from Wverpool, ever reached her
destination is due to the gallant
'fight against i fire made for four
clays and nights by Captain McNeeley and
his crew.
The Monkbarns left Liverpool January
22. All went well until February 21, when
at 4:30 a. m. smoke was discovered com
ing out of the ventilators leading to the
forehold. An investigation revealed the
fact that the cargo was on fire, that the
blaze was a hot one and that only prompt
action could save the Bhip from destruc
tion. Four holes were cut in the deck
B.n& water was pumped on the blazing
merchandise until the flames were sub
dued sufficiently to allow sailors to de
scend Into the hold, fix tackle to the
smoldering bales and hoist them to the
deck, from where they were promptly
thrown overboard. Nearly all the cargo
In the forward hold was jettisoned before
the fire was extinguished. Little harm
was done to the hull of the ship.
The cargo Jettisoned and in wnlcn tne~
fire started, by spontaneous .combustion
it is thought, consisted of oakum, felt
'"rhe fire was extinguished February 25,
and from then until port was reached the
voyage was uneventful. .
W Bucknor, the ship's cook, was' on

Therefore, it seems to me aÂ« a worktngman
that the business Interests of this city, that
the Interests of the working classes of this
city, demand that the transport work or any
other work shall not be taken away from San
Francisco la the interests of Vallejo or any
other place. We should center all our forces
for tire protection of the business Interests of
this city and for the advancement and pros
perity of San Francisco and the working
classes. Respectfully yours,
THOMAS McCONNELU
It is a positive fact that large numbers of
first-class mechanics in San Francisco of every
trade will not work at the navy yard for the
reason that they can get better wages and bet
ter treatment in this city, clear'of spotters and
Â¦pies, where they can call their souls their
own, where they can stand for their rights
like men and where the only qualifications re
quired In seeking employment are faithful
service and mechanical ability. .
Owing to a system of grading. Mare Island
has become the dumping ground for inferior
mechanics of every class.
There is no provision for overtime.
He is deprived of every privilege It Is poe
Â¦jible to take away from him. Privileges cheer
fully granted -by the most exacting of private
firms are hierh crimes at Mare Island.
Wages paid at Mare. Island are lower than
those paid by private firms In this city.
May I ask If the business Interest In cur
Government work in this city Is to be thrown
conn for the benefit of the railroad and the
ealoon-keepers of Vallejo? It is said that the
â¢workingmen would benefit by having the work
done la "the navy yard. I fail to Bee where
the workincraen cf this city would benefit by
any such thine Let us take the system of
handling outside labor at present In vogue at
Jiare Island.
In the first Dlace labor unions have no voice
In the conduct of affairs In any department of
the Mare Island Navy Yard. The worklngman
has to leave his unionism in Vallejo, and the
moment he strikes the yard he has to work
against every principle of unionism, manhood,
honor and fair r>lay.
SYSTEM HERB- IS BETTER.
WORKED DAT AND NIGHT.
Sixth â That the mechanics and laborers of
all classes worked both day and night. Sun
days and holidays included, until they became
completely worn out. They gave faithful and
honest service to the Government.
Seventh â That I never saw men better treat
ed both by their employers and the Govern
ment officials on the dock, than were we. the
eimy of men engaged in discharging, loading,
repairing and getting away from San Fran
cisco as quickly as possible the transports en
gaged la carrying soldiers, horses, mules and
supplies to the Philippine islands.
Eighth â That It was my duty as president of
the Shipwrights' Association at the time this
Â¦work was going on to look out for the Inter
ests of ray orsanization and its members and
I now most positively state that every rule
of the Shipwrights' Association was strictly
complied with; that every favor and privilege
that was asked that was reasonable and right
Â¦was cheerfully granted, and it is a well-known
fact to the union men engaged on that work
that the efflcials oa the transport Cock were
always ready to meet them more than half
way.
Ninth â That the work cost a very large
amount of money there Is no doubt. Who got
this money? The lion's share of It was dis
tributed among the army of worktnismen en
pag-ed in the work; their wives and families
b-cnented thereby and almost every man, wo
man and child in San Francisco directly or in
directly got a share of that money.
This" is the work the Examiner is seeking to
firlvt out of San Francisco. Our business men
are attacked In a most shameful manner. The
<lry dock company is the latest local industry
to come under , the Examiner's lash. This
company is one of the best employers In the
6tate. It is now engaged and has been for the
past year in building drydocks and Improving
the clant for the better accommodation of
shipping to the extent of more than a million
dollars. It always employs union men. It pays
-the highest wages and trouble between It and
its employes has been unknown.
The following communication has been
received from Thomas McConnell. late
president of the Shipwrights' Association:
SAX FRANCISCO. June 1Â». 1302.
Editor Call-Dear Sir: Will you kindly allow
ne to present through the medium of your
raluable pajer the views of * â¢*Wngman
is well as to state some facts with reference
:o the building and repairing of government
Ihlps at Mare island Navy Yard and by Pnvata
:ontractors in San Francisco. Also to ask
r hlch is to the best Interests of San Fran
:isco and the tvorkin&men of this city and
Â»hy ehould thÂ« Examiner seek to hound out
sf this city the government -work in favor of
Vallejo or 'anywhere else. 1TT _ iri
CALLED PACK OF THIEVES.
It has been published In the Examiner and
scattered broadcast to the world that the busi
ness men of this city engaged in furnishlnj,
supplies and repairing the transports are a.
peck of thieves; that it cost ten times more
to repair transports than ordinary passenger
ships &nd that as a general rule bad work was
Â°Xo'w sir I desire to state that I -worked as a
shipwright oa almost every transport that was
fitted out in this city with the exception of
those (lone by the Union Iron Works and 1
new most positively state: Z''Ci%
First â That the repair work done by all
cltsMss of mechanics in all branches was gen
erally first class.
Secondâ That the same care and attention
was given to the work by employers and men
that is given to the work of the most particu
lar of private firms.
Thirdâ That Mr. Humphries, who actually
superintended all the repair work. Is one of
the most exacting of men and insisted on hav
ing all work done in first class shape. He
gave the matter his personal attention day
and night. He was among the men at ail
hours. He is a thorough mechanic and laid
out a large amount of the work himself. He
â¢worked harder than any other man I ever saw
holding a similar position.
Fourthâ That I never saw any unnecessary
â¢work done or men kept longer on the ships
than the time necessary to do the work. ,
Fifth â That most of the work was done un
der the most difficult and trying circumstances
Â¦while the ships were discharging and loading.
Men risked their iives at all times both day
and night :n trying to get the work done and
get the ships away with as little delay as pos
sible Mechanics were working all over the
clips with slings of freight swinging over their
heads with crowds of stevedores, wheelbar
rÂ«ira shovels coal shovelers and numerous
other things in full action in their way and all
SLTOund them.

SUTRO ESTATE
OWES LARGE SUM
Mrs.; Dr. : Merritt Says
She Has No Money to
Pay Legacies.
Has $20,000 to Meet Indebt
edness of Almost Half
v^ { a Million.
Dr. Emma Sutro Merritt, executrix of
the will of. the late Adolph Sutro, was
kept busy in Judge Coff ey's court yester
day answering .questions propounded by
Garret McEnerney relative to the'condi
tion of * the estate of the deceased philan
thropist., The Inquiry is duo to the ob
jections made by McEnerney to the
'granting of a decree of distribution of a
legacy of $3000 left by Sutro to J. M.
Kerr. '
McEnerney objected to the decree on
the ground that his four clients, ' Mrs.
Morbio, Mrs. English, Mrs.. Neusbaum
and Edgar Sutro, had not yet received a
special bequest of $5000 each left them by
their father. He claims that further dis
tribution should be stopped until they are
paid, and intimated that Mrs. Merritt
has been unjust In 'her treatment of his
clients, for the reason that since the
death of Sutro they have opposed her in
many ways. "Is not that so?" he asked
Mrs. Merritt at the conclusion of his
statement.
"Well," the witness replied, "I do not
think my brothers and sisters should be-,
paid at this time. I have only a little
more than $20,000 on hand to pay bequests
amounting to $62,868 75, with $13,302 44 In
terest thereon. I have thus far paid to
legatees $229,298 17, with $70,000 interest.
The estate Is indebted to the Hibernia
Bank in the sum of $408,500, there are
bills amounting to $2500 unpaid and also
a judgment against us for $7700."
The matter was put over on request of
McEnerney to enable him to consult with
his associate, C. S. Wheeler, who is out
of town. ;

NEW YORK. June 20.â The speculative
liquidation which broke prices yesterday wm
no longer in evidence to-day, but the market
clipped back into a rather apathetic condi
tion, the dealings dropping well below half a
million ehares acaln. Of this total a large
proportion was concentrated in a few leading
rtoclcs, notably United Ftat.es Steel, Missouri
Pacific Et. Paul and the Wabash stocks. ThÂ«
evidence support for United States Steel
was an effective influence in steadying thÂ«
market, aa yesterday's Bharp break in thai
etock had an unsettling sentimental effect on
the whole market. There was evidence of re
buying of stocks by the large interests which
liquidated yesterday and the day before. Thu
served to relieve a latent feeling that the re
cent bull campaign had been a preliminary to
a prolonged bear camoairn. To-day's strength
was restricted to a few points and was 'not

mand and prices were advancing for spot ce
reals and flour. At home rains fell continu
ously and more were predicted generally. Ad
vices trom Nebraska stated that the wheat
was ripe and waited cutting, but the ground
was in such a soaked condition that f arnn-rs
could not attempt the work. Further than

situation. 1b becoming somewhat of a factor,

France has had a cold, wet and backward

doubtful. There Is some talk at Chicago of a
possible French demand, and Paris has been
buying some on that market.

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
There seems to be a disposition this year to
speculate in futures, which is to be regretted,
as the selling of dried fruits short Is a detri
ment to the trade, and Inflicts great loss on
the fruit growers, as the sellers often hava
to break the market when the crops come In to
; fill their contracts. Some priced have been
made by these short sellers, but except in
Apricots and Peaches they are a matter of
guesswork, as previously mentioned. Some of
these future prices are reported from the East,
as follows: Santa Clara prunes, f. o. b. the
coast, in bags: 40s-50s, 4%Ci 50s-60s, 4%c;
Â»iCa-70s, 3%c; 70s-S0s, 3%c; S0s-90s. 2%c, and
OCs-lOOs, 2%c for October shipment. A price
of 2%c, four-size bag basis, has been made
by one holder on Santa Claras.

the market is very weak at the decline, with
excessive stocks. Receipts, however, are again
decreasing, those yesterday being the lightest

commission merchants are scouring the field
for purchasers. But if many Eggs are put into

the market may work around into better shape
again in tfte course of a few days.

Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Trade at. the East is more quiet, owing to
the advancing season- and the bad effect of
prolonged labor controversies is being felt in
certain lines, i Reports from- the interior and
the Far West .are more.' encouraging, bounti
ful harvests being - expected, while the light
stocks carried over from * the previous season
assure profitable prices. - ' . \
The best indication- of continued prosperity
Is the fact that quotations -do not recede, even
in the lines where at present there is only a
moderate degree of activity. Railway earnings
thus far reported for June increased 3.0 per
cent over 1900. : " â¢;' " v

Lack of rain in the Southwest is the only
seriously unfavorable crop indication of the
week, '.while- exceptionally encouraging reports
are received from most points. Domestic grain

England irained nearly $3,000,000 in gold yes

the whole financial world, in view of the heavy

ment's surplus revenue is still under $4,000,000
for this month, compared with nearly $11,000,
000 for the same period in June last year, and
reports from Washington Indicate that the
Treasury authorities hardly expect the year's
surplus to reach the estimated figure of $90,
000,000. With ten days remaining of the fiscal
yeartthe eurplus is still below $80,000,000. The
rains in the West, which are delaying the har

demand on New York for money to move the
crops.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables
NEW YORK, June 20.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will nay:
Conditions governing present and future do '
not show very sharp contrasts. While the.im
mediate present situation is clouded by Â¦ the
rather less favorable industrial outlook and the
prospect of . an extension of the coal strike
into the bituminous fields, the continued favor
able progress made by. all the, leading crops
lends assurance. that, once the. present strained
condition of industrial - affairs is relieved , a
large and prosperous fall and winter business
-is assured. That In spite of disturbances, past
and present, a heavy business is going forward
is proved by the continued fine reports of rail
road earnings fbr. this season of the year, very
Â¦heavy bank clearings and the comparatively
Ismail number of business embarrassments re
ported. It of course must be borne in mind
that the , coal trade troubles, though making
their" Influence felt in a wider area than before,
are still comparatively localized, and outside
of sections immediately affected In such places
as the central West, the Southwest and the
Northwest, business Â¦Â¦ both present and for fu
ture delivery is of good volume, in most'in
stances in excess of a year ago. With the ex
ception of too much moisture in' the South
west, it followed with the harvesting and con
dition of wheat and continued drynesa In Texas,
spoiling corn and Impairing cotton conditions,
the agricultural outlook is practically -without
flaws. The supply of anthracite coal is slowly
ebbing and the use of soft coal is growing,
despite city ordinances. The strike is causing
some additional furnaces to shut down 'and
thus accentuating the scarcity in the Eastern
part of the country. Prices of farm products
show the influence of improving crop condi
tions. Wheat is one exception to the general
weakness, but this is much due to bad weather
reports from Europe. Corn closes . lower on a
flattering outlook for the growing crop, i Hog
products have also weakened on larger receipts,
but beef prices show notable strength. Refined
sugar is lower, after the heavy buying of the
past month.
The scarcity. of pig iron is causing a notice
able stiffening jn prices.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week,
aggregate 3,S0O,434 bushels, against 3,004,314
bushels last week and 5.520.S31 bushels in this

PAUL DESTINE, the great reader of hu-
man destiny, may be consulted daily on all
affairs of life: his information and advice
on marriage, divorce, separation, love and
family affairs, business transactions, law-
suits, mining, etc., are accurate and truth-
ful; he reunites the saparated, settles lovers'
quarrels, causes speedy marriages, makes
you successful and prosperous; locates hid-
den treasures and mines; settles old estates
and accounts that time and circumstances
have placed beyond the lawyer's shrewdness:
long-standing and chronic diseases that have
baffled the physician's skill cured without
the use of medicine; there is no home so
sad and dreary, no heart so forsaken and
lonely, no life so hard and blighted that can-
not be set right and kept right after a visit
to this inspired man of modern times; no
matter what trouble you may have, call and
he will help you or charge nothing for his
tervicef"; "palmistry taught, mediumistio
persons developed;" learn a profession that
will bring you from $10 to $25 per day; 10
a. m. to 8 p. m. : fee, reasonable.

one from Austral a (Newcastle), 1290 tons; one
from British Cuiumb'a. 2350 tons; total. 11.000

tha writer remembers to have come to hand
in any' s.ngle week. The coal market Â¦ is pro
nouncedly showing the inroads that are being
made into Its consumption by oil. Of course
it Is a very marked advantage to all con

chase their power at a great reduction on the
prices of former years. -The-p.lcea now ruling
for coal are also very materially reduced. The
best Australian coals were sell.ng two years
ago at fully $2 per ton more than is being
offered to-day. This Is a large shrinkage and
is caused principally by the Influx of oil. Low
priced oil enables the gas companies to pro
duce cheap gas for stoves and grates: this
precludes thÂ° Wellington Company from chang

Emperor William concluded with call
ing for three cheers for Aix-la-Chapelle.
This Justifies me In saying that our two great
creeds must, while living side by side, keep In
view their one great aim â to uphold and
strengthen the fear ot God and reverence for
religion. Whether we are moderns or whether
we labor in this or that field does not matter
at all. He who does not found his life on re
ligion is a lost man. I rejoice that I have
placed my, whole empire, my people and my
army, as well as myself and my house, be
neath the. cross and under the protection of him
who said: "Heaven nnd earth shall pass away,
but my word shall not pass away."
What, however, his poweuul personality was
able to effect, namely, combining the oiHce of
a Homan Emperor with that oi a Germanic
King, was denied his successors, who, striving
to hold the world-wide lmpenum, lorgot the
cause of Germania so that little by little the
German land and people decayed and the Ro
man Empire of . German nationality fell to
pieces.
Now, however, another empire has come to
life, and its tasks are different from those of
ancient days. Confined in their outward limits
to the borders of their country, the Germans
have settled down to the work which has lallen
upon them. In these days the young empire Is
strengthening itselt and confidence In It is ever
Increasing. The mighty German army consti
tutes the support or the peace of Europe. In
contormity with the character of their race, the
Germans have kept themselves within bounds.
Our tongue is passing beyond the seas. Every
thought of science Is first turned to account by
us, to be afterward adejj^ted by other nations.
This Is the world-wide imperium after which
Germanic genius strives.
But It must not be lorgotten that the empire
was rooted in simplicity and fear of God. I
look to all to help me spread religion among the
people in order that the German name may
preserve its health and strength. This applies
equally to the, two creeds. Catholic and
Protestant. It is with pride and joy that I am
able to tell that the Pope said to my. special
embassador who went to Rome on the occasion
of the Holy Father's jubilee, that he had al
ways- kept a high opinion of the piety of the
Germans and their Emperor and of that of the
German' army. The Pope asked my embassa
dor to tell his sovereign that the country In
Europe where control, order and discipline still
prevailed with' respect for authority and regard
for the church, and where the church could live,
was the German Empire, and for that the Pa
pal See was Indebted to the German Emperor.
AIX-LA-CHAPEL.LE, Prussia, June
20.â A striking, speech on religion was de
livered by Emperor William at' the City
Hall here yesterday after his arrival
from Berlin, accompanied by the Empress
and the Crown Pnnce Frederick William.
After observing that the city was typi
cal of the German empire, Charlemagne,
on whom Rome conferred the dignity of a
Roman Caesar, having fixed the seat of
government there, the Emperor said:
The number of children under 17 years of age
Is 103.911, an increase of 399 for the year.
The census marshals discovered a loss of near
ly 700 children In the Potrero district, caused
by the leaving of families. While the number
of hotels and flats have increased in the cen
tral and western sections of the city and are
well occupied, indicating an Increase In our
population, but few children were found In
them. -Prom the facts conveyed by this school
census, the population of the city can be safe
ly estimated at 3Â«$.neo.
It Is gratifying to note that the enrollment
Of pupils In the public schools Increased 1792,
and that the number of children not attending
school, public or private, decreased 1200. The
number of such children is returned as 19,434.
The minimum legal age for school attendance
is 6 years. There are about 3000 children be
tween the ages of 5 and 6, hence we can as
sume that in this city and county about 16,000
children of school age attended no school dur
ing the last year. Conclusions must not be
drawn that this number of children are being
reared as illiterate. It is safe to claim that
the large majority either have attended or will
attend school before attaining the age of 17.
Statistics compiled In large cities demon
strate the fact that the average school life of
a child is six years, and that about 60 per cent
of children of school age are in daily, attend
ance at school. San Francisco makes a good
exhibit in this particular, 64 per cent of chil
dren of school age having been In daily attend
ance at schools, public or private. Neverthe
less there is a large number of schlldren who
are being reared with meager or no schooling,
a fact that emphasizes the need of an effective
compulsory educational law, parental or truant
schools and enlarged school accommodations.
Greater exertions must be made and greater
means secured to prevent any child from fall
ing to secure that discipline, education and
knowledge which our schools afford.
The school census for fiscal year terminating
June 30, 1902, shows a slight increase in ' im
portant figures over that of 1901. The appor
tionment of the State school fund to counties
is based on the number 'of children between
the ages of 5 and 17 years. The number of
such children is found to be 82,391, an increase
of 218.

; IS HELD TJP AND ROBBED
When night fell yesterday the ship
wrecked party was dtill camped on the
desolate spot near Mussel Rock. . Captain
Schou and his men manfully stuck to
their post, thinking only of their duty.
Charles Nelson, president of the Charles
Nelson Company, stated last night Â«that
The members of the Eureka' s crew were
indignant that no relief had been sent to
them. "We are worn , out," said one of
the party, "and we cannot leave here
without word from the owners. It would
have been an easy matter for the owners
to send a wagon out and take us and our
belongings into the city to a boarding
house. Our ship is wrecked,- and I bup
pose our lives don't count for much."
SAILORS ARE INDIGNANT.
Captain Smith telephoned* to the 'offices
of the owners of the wrecked vessel and
notified them that Captain Schou desired
instructions. . The hours slipped along and
no word was sent to Â¦. the shipwrecked
party. Yesterday afternoon ' a represent
ative of The Call drove out to the scene
of the wreck. Captain Schou said that he
could not understand why the owners did
not send him wprd. . Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦ Â¦ .-. ,
Captain Smith and his crew of life-sav
ers/returned to their station, after again
offering to take Captain Schou and- his
party with them, which* offer was declin
ed, pending word from the owners of the
wrecked schooner. â- * : Â¦ â¢â¢ . > ? i
When daylight broke yesterday morning,
Captain Schou. and his companions pre
sented a forlorn appearance. The all
night vigil, together with the exposure to
the wind and fog, had told on them. The
life-savers had remained .with the ship
wrecked persons and were tired out also.
The life-savers and some of the crew of
the Eureka returned to the *vessel and
brought the personal belongings of Cap
tain Schou and his wife ashore. The sai
lors brought their clothing with them and
some provisions and sought the warmth
of a log fire that was built on the
beach. â¢ /
SPEND A .WEARY NIGHT.
When the life-savers arrived at the spot
where Captain Schou. with his wife and
his crew, were huddled, they offered to
take them to the life-saving station. Cap
tain Schou said that he would not aban
don the wreck until he heard from- the
owners, and his wife decided to remain
beside her husband. The crew also said
they would stay with the captain and
await the instructions of their employers.
- As soon as the vessel struck, ' Captain.
Schou gave ordersfor the ship's boat to be
lowered. The captain, . his; wife, and the
seven members of the crew entered the
small boat and made for the shore,
through the breakers. The water dashed
over the men and the woman and the par
ty waded breast, deep through the water
to dry land, when the boat grounded.
The dense fog hung like a blanket over
the sea and land and the shipwrecked
people almost perished from the cold.
One of the crew volunteered to seek relief
and started northward along the beach.
After a weary tramp of four miles he
reached the South Side Life-saving Sta
tion and notified the men stationed there.
Captain Smith and his men at once ,went
to the scene of the wreck, taking their
surf boat on the wagon drawn by a double
team. '...,â¢â¢
The currents carried the Eureka south
of her course, however, and at 8:30 o'clock!
on Thursday night, she was thrown on
the beach, ten miles south of the â¢ Cliff
House and half, a mile north of Mussel
Rock. Her bottom was torn off Â¦ by a
rocky ledge and the schooner was doomed
to destruction. Â¦Â¦Â¦ .â¢"Â¦".-.- â¢; -
FIND SHELTER ON SHORES.
UNMINDFUL of the cold wind and
the penetrating fog, the crew of
the lumber schooner Eureka,
which was wrecked near Mussel
Rock on Thursday night, have
since camped on the bleak beach, await
ing relief from the owners of the vessel.
The wife of. Captain J. P. Schou has
refused to leave her husband's side and
with her faithful dogr, Rover, and her
pet black cat. has, since the shipwreck,
waited for relief from the Charles Nel
son Company, which owns the ill-fated
schooner.
From the time of landing on Thursday
night until this morning, the crew of the
Eureka and the captain's wife have
camped at the base or a towering cliff,
exposed to the elements and the danger
of death In the event of a gale blowing
up from the northeast.
The schooner Eureka left the port of
San Francisco on Thursday shortly after
noon bound for Humboldt Bay in ballast.
At 5 p. m. she was off Duxbury reef and
ran Into a heavy fog. The wind died. out
and the vessel .drifted with the currents.
Captain Schou said Â¦Â¦ yesterday that at. the
hour mentioned he thought he-was four
miles off shore and eight miles south of
Duxbury reef. * ' â¢
In addition to Captain Schou and his
wife, the following were on the vessel
when she ran ashore: First Mate F. W.
Randerlin, Second Mate Tom Nicholson,
Steward High Thompson, Sailors A. Wolf,
Ed Russell, Will Jackson and Frank Van
cora.
Late last night Captain Smith of the
South Side life-saving station was asked
over the telephone If the Eureka' s crew
was being cared for. The answer of the
life-saving captain was that the ship
wrecked party was still camped on the
beach and had been instructed by the
owners to strip the wreck this morning.
In the dense fog and subjected to the
ocean wind, sheltered only by the protec
tion of a small cove, Captain Schou, with
his brave wife and his crew, for two
nights and a day have remained on the
desolate spot near Mussel Rock where
the Eureka has found her grave. â
The Eureka was a three-masted wooden
schooner of 232 tons. She was built in
Eureka nearly forty years ago, and was
valued at $5000.
STILL CAMP ON THE BEACH.

wreck." .
James Tyson, the manager or the
Charles Nelson Company, was seen last
night at his home in Alameda. When
asked what steps had been taken for the
relief of the shipwrecked crew of the
Eureka and Captain Schou's wife he said:
â¢'I went out this afternoon and arranged
for the crew to be taken to the life-sav
ing station. We will begin to strip the
ship in the morning and save all we can
from her."

thus do away with a grade of 15 pÂ«r cent

Doran did as requested and Prendergast
retired. After the court adjourned Ma
hony called upon Judge Conlan in his
chambers and asked him to take Pren
dergast, who he said had been "broken
in," but the Judge positively refused.
Aiahony thought it was hard upon him,
as he could not get a position for Pren
dergast In any of the courts. Judge Con
lan then asked him why he had removed
Rice, and he replied that he did not want
Rice as clerk of the court. Conlan insist
ed upon Rice being returned or some
other clerk appointed who would meet
his approval. There the matter rests.
Prendergast, who is one of Crimmins'
lieutenants, was deputy in the Justices
of the Peace office under E. W. Wil
liams, who was removed, along with his
deputies, by Mayor Schmitz. Since then
County Clerk Mahony has been vainiv
trying to get Prendergast a clerkship in
one of the courts.
I decline to accept Mr. Prendergast as clerk
of this court. I have not been consulted as to
who the clerk should be and I decline to take
Prendergrast under any circumstances. Per
sonally I have nothing against him, but I do
not want him to handle any papers in my court.
I should have been notified of Rice's removal
and consulted as to his successor. I shall ask
you, Mr. Doran, to take charge of the books
and papers.
When Judge Conlan took his seat on
the bench yesterday morning he found
Prendergast installed as clerk. The Judge
at once sent for T. L. Doran, Mihony's
deputy at the Hall of Justice, and ad
dressing him said: â¢
Clerk John P. Rice of Judge Conlan's
court notified the Judge on Thursday
that he had at his own request been
transferred to the County Clerk's office
and that Prendergast would succeed him.
Judge Conlan demurred and telephoned
to County Clerk Mahony to call at his
chambers yesterday morning and explain
the change. Conlan objected to Rice be
ing transferred without the court being
consulted. He said that he would not al
low Prendergast to occupy the position
of clerk in his court.
Pat Prendergast, a deputy county
clerk, unattached, is having a hard row
to hoe in his attempt to become a clerk
of one of the Police Courts. When Fred
B. Conway, clerk of Judge Mogan"s court,
disappeared Prendergast was assigned to
fill the vacancy. Judge Mogan objected
strongly to the assignment, and insisted
upon obtaining the services of George
Lee. Prendergast consequently was not
installed into the office, and Lee is now
clerk of the court.
That Black has a criminal record in
the East is evidenced by the fact that he
is wanted at Springfield, Mass., for pass
ing bogus checks. Chief of Police Witt
man expected to hear further from the
police officials of that city yesterday, but
the wires were silent. Black declines to
discuss his case with the reporters, giv
ing as his reason that his attorneys have
counseled him to maintain a strict si
lence during the pendency of his case
In court.
Detective TVhittaker went to San Jose
yesterday by order of Captain Martin to
eecure data concerning the "Earl Fruit
and Produce Company" used by Black in
the furtherance af his frauds. No such
corporation exists, but nevertheless Black
managed to do a thriving business in
uttering checks upon that concern. Whit
taker has secured some valuable data
concerning Black's operations in San Jose
which will be used against him in the
trial.
Attorney Harris of the prosecution
asked the court for a continuance of the
case till Monday on the ground that he
had to secure out-of-town witnesses and
that it was impossible to do so before
that time. The attorneys for Black pro
tested against this course, they affirming
their readiness to proceed with" the exam
ination immediately. The court thought
the request a reasonable one and it was
granted. The matter was set for hearing
at 11 o'clock Monday morning.
It was announced in court that District
Attorney Byington would personally con
duct the prosecution. Byington is gath
ering evidence of fraud against Black, all
of which was published in detail by The
Call yesterday. He will answer to two
charges, one preferred by Colonel A. An
drews and another by E. S. Scott, cashier
of the Western National Bank, both of
whom were victimized by means of worth
less checks. The evidence in these cases
is conclusive, and the prosecution is cer
tain that the hotel sharp and utterer of
fictitious checks will be convicted without
difficulty.
The defendant sat with his hands
screening his face from the gaze of the
curious. Since his arrest Black has
evinced a great terror for a camera and
whenever he appears in public he takes
the precaution to keep his face covered
in order that no chance snapshot may
catch his lineaments. He watched the pro
ceedings in court with a moody express-
Ion on his face, and he affected a dis
interestedness which his nervous manner
belied.
Blacks case was called in Police Judge
Conlan's court yesterday. He was repre
sented by Attorneys Schooler, Campbell
and Mack, while the prosecution was in
the hands of Assistant District Attorney
Harris and Attorneys R. M. Fitzgerald
and Colin Campbell, who appeared for
the National Bankers' Association.
Evidence is accumulating against J. B.
"Black, alias Jones, alias Stone, who is
held on two charges of felony for forgery
a.nd defrauding numerous hotel keepers
by means of fictitious checks. That
Black is a sharper of prominence in the
East, where he is wanted for swindling,
is already clearly established. That he
will serve time in the penitentiary here
Is the belief of the detectives who are
working on the case.
