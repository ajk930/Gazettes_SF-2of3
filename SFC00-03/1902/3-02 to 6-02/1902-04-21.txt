TERSOF THE STRIKERS AND SCENES WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY AS "A RESULT OF '. THE TROUBLE.
Amid the streams of water on
all sides, the flames from the
lower deck and dense clouds of
smoke, the passengers rushed
from their staterooms and a
frightful panic ensued. The ap
peals of the officers and crew
could not stay the terror-stricken
Most of the passengers were
still in bed when Second Clerk
Phillips gave the alarm. The en
gineers started the pumping en
gines and the crew brought all
the hose into play.
The fire was discovered in the
forward hatch larboard at 4:05
o'clock and burned fiercely.
shortly after 4 o'clock this morn
ing close to Ogdens Landing,
near this city- While almost all
on board were asleep, the steamer
City of Pittsburg was discovered
to be on fire and in a few mo
ments was burned to the waters
edge. The loss of more than
$80,000 on the steamer does not
include the cargo, both being a
total loss. The latest estimates
are that there were 150 persons
on board and that not more than
v Â¦
half of them were saved, many of
the latter being burned or in
jured. As the register of the
steamer was burned, no list can
be given either of the victims or
the survivors and in the confusion
it has been impossible to com
plete lists. Captain Phillips ad
mits that the death list may reach
sixty.

Ing made several trips over, the line'.dur
ing the morning and collected fares'; with
the dignity of an old-time conductor/ He
was Jeered good : naturedly ;. by the crowds,
but paid little attention to the cries of

afternoon, he visited .the Mission-street
carbbuse and raade an address to several.
VINING AS CONDUCTOR.
rHE. strike of - the conductors
and motormen of I the Market
street railway system Â¦ was on
in real earnest yesterday. The
tie-up was complete in every
respect, and barring one car
on each line, which was sent over, the
system, in order that the franchise rights
of the company might not be impaired,
and the running of the mail â cars, not a
wheel on the entire "system moved
throughout the day.
The completeness of the tie-up was a
matter of surprise not only to the offi
cers of the railway '. company, but to the
public as well. The unanimity of action
on the part of the employes in walking
out almost to a man is an indication of
the deep-seated feeling that existed
among the men against the company for
the stringent regulations 'Â¦ Manager.-Vin
ing has seen fit to enforce. ;One of those
which has been most obnoxious to Â¦ the
men was the espionage to which they
were subjected on -their days off. A rule
which has worked a ! hardship on the
conductors is .one forbidding \ them to
lean against the rear railing of the car
while on duty. The most obnoxious, reg-.
illation of all was, that which ..practical
ly forbade the men, from joining the union
under whose auspices the strike Was in
augurated.
A feeble attempt was made toturnout
some of the cara of the Mission and; Va
lencia street branches at the usual hour
yesterday morning. As fast -as trie 'men
appeared at the carhouses they, were met
by the pickets of the strikers, and a mo
ment later they walked^ away: in com
pany. One car -was turned : out without
opposition, and, manned by two men, it
proceeded to the ferry." The strikers' were
orderly, and although a number "of police-"
men were on the scene their services
were not called into reauisltlon.

GUATEMALA CITY, Guate
mala, April 20. â Three earth
quakes Friday night reduced to
ruins Quesaltenango, the second
city of importance in Guatemala
and having 25,000 inhabitants,
and completely destroyed the
town of Amatitlan. Both of these
towns were capitals of depart
ments of the same name that each
It is reported that 500 persons
were killed in Quesaltenango, but
the rumor lacks confirmation.
No direct telegraphic communi
cation has been obtained and the
exact loss of life cannot now be
ascertained,
.The disaster is greater than
first reports led the ."public to be
lieve. News of the destruction,
which extends . 100 miles along
the western part of the republic,
is coming in slowly, because all of
the telegraph wires are down. It
is known that Amatitlan exists
no more as a town, the seismic
disturbance having been so great.
The inhabitants â that is, those
of 10,000 residents who escaped
death in the cataclysm â are
camping in the, open air for
safety, not daring to return to the
ruined confines of the town.
Some of the inhabitants are build
ing temporary mud huts.
More news has been obtained
about the condition of affairs at
Amatitlan than at Quesaltenan
go, as the former town is only fif
teen miles south of this city, while
the latter is more than 100 miles
to the northwest. â¢:.-â¢Â¦"â¢
, Couriers say earthquake shocks
are still being felt at short inter
vals in the neighborhood of Ques
ailenango.
There have been serious seis
mic disturbances along the Cor
dillera, affecting towns and vil
lages between Amatitlan and
Quesaltenango. No reliable in
formation regarding the loss of
life or the extent of property de
struction in these intermediate ,
places'has reached here.

CHIEF ISSUES
SWIKE ORDERS
TO POLICEMEN
. MAYOR SCHMITZ ACTS.
- Mayor Schmitz' has taken steps to bring
about a conference between the strikers
and employers with a. view toward effect
ing a settlement of. tha strike. Early m
the proceedings the Mayor made the dis
covery that there, was not apparently any
one â¢ to Â¦ speak Â¦ authoritatively for the
United Railroads of San - FranclscoS At
torney. General Tirey L.- Ford, who Is the
legal adviser, of the corporation, was said
to have a power of attorney, to act for the
couraging. They learned that the entire
system was tied up tightly and that the
prospects of a settlement with the strik
ers on any other basis than the granting
of their. demands were meager. The sit
uation was one which prompted the own
ers of all kinds of vehicles to transform
them ipto public conveyances, and until
the settlement of the strike these vehicles
will be in active demand.,
. The- strikers held^a very enthusiastic
meeting .at the; Turk-street Temple yes
terday, afternoon, 'and several hundred
w . ere *t? ded }Â° the u nion membership. Of
the 2S0O employes of the system the union
Claims to have secured 2500. with excel
lent, prospects for securing. the remainder
to-day or to-morrow. The strikers are
very hopeful that their.; demands will be
granted soon, and all express regret that
they should have ' been the source of so
much Inconvenience to the traveling pub-
. The entire day; force of street car -em
ployes j reported as usual yesterday- morn
ing at the different car barns and aboitt
threetfourths~of the number had no" de

work. The delegates; of the, Street Rail

..Mayor Schmlta was a very; busy man
yesterday. He arrived in this city from
Sacramento "at 9 o'clock, and although ho
had had little sleep during, the night he
began an immediate consideration of the
strike and the best methods to be adoptetl
to secure an early ; settlement of the con
troversy. 1 '" ; Â¦-Â¦ 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦' Â¦; ; i
The Mayor notified Chief of Police Witt
man that hewould be in his office/at thje
Clty;Hall at 2 o'clock, and from that' time
untili" midnight f his - time -was taken up
with* interviews Â¦ relative to .'.-" the strike.
Among "the. first callers Â¦ were several
members of the executive committee of
Division No. '. 205, . Amalgamated
tion of Street Railway Employes of Amer
ica? headed/ by Richard Cornelius,, presi
dent of the local branch, Harry Knox and
others.' Cornelius addressed the Mayor,
and' said the were orderly and
that they desired to have the' Mayor ad
dress them at their meeting: in the Turk
street Temple. ' ' ." . Â¦ ' '
"Â¦: The Mayor: replied that it- was -his pur
pose to remain -perfectly neutral in the
matter in order that no question could be
raised in. the event his services as me
diator between the railway \ company and
the strikers were requested:- Her assured
the 'members of the committee that' his

Cornelius stated that the entire Market

would be impossible for the .railway oeo

COAST STEAMSHIP
HAS , A NARROW ESCAPE
Since the breakdown of party power in
the House on Friday there has been al
most a panic. This has been intensified
by the duplication of this situation in the
Senate. Administration Senators are all
asking," "What can be done? /Will the
Cuban situation be duplicated on the
canal bill? Will not this session of Con
gress end in a colossal failure, which will
make defeat inevitable in the fall?"
- Men who have much to do with .mak
ing the policy of ' the Republican . party
declared that for, the time being Congress
had- got, into a position of antagonism to
the administration, and it was for the ad
ministration to step in and. assert itself.
They point out that the Republicans have
ceased. to have leaders in either branch
of Congress, and that the Democrats, who
have had no leadership for years and nO
fixity of purpose in a decade, are really
molding legislation. . .
One View of Situation.
In some quarters there is a disposition
to criticize the President and to throw
much of the blame upon him for the con
dition prevailing. Republican representa
tives said to-day that Mr. Roosevelt had
not been as firm as he should have been
in insisting- on giving a remedy for the
CubUn situation from the first. Instead
of that,. they said, he hadâ not once or
twice; but several times â declared ' that
the Cuban difficulty was not of his liking,
but was something he had Inherited from
the late President McKinley.
The color given to this was that the
President was : indifferent to the Cuban
cause and was seeking to get relief for
Cuba in ' a perfunctory way, simply be
cause the late President was committed
to it, and not because it was something
that was right and to which the national
honor was pledged. - %> Â¦
No disguise is made of the reeling
among Republicans that the party, is In a
critical state. The Congressional commit
tee/it is said on good authority, is feeling
very nervous â¢ and is looking to ! the na
tional committee to take hold of the com
ing Congressional campaign and help out.
It is doubtful if it can get any help from
the national. committee. The House has
from the outset of the present session
ignored the national committee^ Its ad
vice, whether given by Senator Hanria,
the chairman, or Postmaster General
Payne, the vice chairman, has -been Con
temptuously rejected. . Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ ,

Seem to have no leader. The Republicans

The case of Mrs. Fannie McCallum'of
Leavenworth, Ind., is most pitiful. With
her three children she was 'going to
Caruthersville, Mo., v to join her husband.
She jumped overboard a'nd landed in the
boat, but her three children struck; tne
water and she saw them sink from. sight.
She is frantic with grief. The body of
the youngest of , the little ones was re
covered opposite Mound City.
-Another, sad incident was the loss "of
one of the children\of Pilot . Pritchard.
The little one was tossed from the burn-
Ing steamer into the arms waiting to
catch it in the. yawl, but its head. struck
against the side of the boat and it fell
into the river, and was lost. -
K Captain Doss, : who was drowned, was
an old river ; pilot. He , was making the
trip for pleasure with his son. Pilot Harry
Doss, and when his body was found a mile
or so below the wreck he had on all* his
clothing and a life preserver.- It-Is be
lieved . that he died from the : shock; Â»..-Â¦ .
Many passengers clung by finger tips to
the burning boat, with bodies submerged,'
until, overcome by fire or water; they
sank to death.
SEES HER CHILDREN PERISH.
At Caledonia, three miles below the
scene of the disaster, the flames could be
plainly seen, and the shouts of the pas
sengers heard, and, people put out in
skiffs to- the wreck. They assisted in
saving . some of the passengers. ; .
"After we had managed to get to the
shore fires were lighted and the poor men
and women and children," many of them
in their night dresses, suffering with the
cold and from their wet clothing, huddled
about the fires. Some were burned, but
more were badly bruised and cut by com
ing in contact with the wreckage. People
clung to shutters and anything they
could find to float on to shore, and only
a few succeeded."
"I hung suspended by my arms for a
while and was caught by a man who was
seated in the boat. By this time others
crowded Into the boat and filled it to'
overflowing, but providentially the flames
reached the ropes that held the lifeboat
and we dropped into the river before the
others could push their way into the boat.
The lifeboat commenced to drift back
toward the burning steamer. We had no
oars with which to steer the beat and the
men used their hands for oars. There,
were struggling men and women In the
river all about us on every side.
"I got on the boat at Metropolis to take
passage to Cairo. All of the passengers*
were asleep when I went aboard and I. at
once went to my stateroom and lay down
with my clothes on. \t must have been
an hour or more before I noticed a bright
light shinging into my stateroom. I im
mediately got up and opotaed the door and
saw that the front cabin was on fire. At
that moment the electric light went out.
I put on a life preserver and managed to
grope my way by the flickering light of
the flames to a door opposite. It was the
barber shop. Then I went further down
to another door, which opened out into
the guards. Few passengers were aroused
at this time and I. with others, climbed
out over the guards and down the rail
ing hand over hand over the lifeboats,
which were right below me.

WASHINGTON. April 20.â Several hun
dred military prisoners confined at Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, are awaiting with
impatience. the decision of the Supreme
Court In the case of Peter C. Deming, for
merly, captain in the subsistence depart
ment of the volunteer army.
Deming was courtmartialed and found
guilty of embezzlement, forgery and con
duct unbecoming an officer and- gentle
man, and is now serving a term at Fort
Leavenworth. The Circuit Court of Ap
peals for the district of Kansas ordered
that a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of
Deming issue and that he be discharged
from custody. This action waa based upon
Deming's claim that he was tried by of
ficers of the regular army Instead of vol
unteers. Â¦ Because of the bad precedent es
tablished by the decision and Its effect
upon several hundred prisoners, the .War
Department determined to appeal the case
to the Supreme Court.
Lieutenant-Colonel E. H. Crowder, who
has been given charge of the case, has
Just filed with the Supreme Court his
brief, in. which he asks that the judgment
of the Court of Appeals be reversed. Lieu
tenant Colonel Crowder asserts- that the
history of early legislation in respect to
the army establishes that its object was
to prevent officers of the Federal army
sitting in the trial of officers or soldiers
belonging to troops raised under the sov
ereignty . of the States. The second vol
unteer army raised for the Philippine In
surrection was authorized by an act of
May 2, 1899, and was the army to which
Deming belonged at the time of his trial,
conviction and sentence. Lieutenant Col
onel Crowder contends that the' effect of
the act was to invest the volunteer army
raised under Its provisions with Â» charac
ter essentially different from that of the
volunteer armies of previous wars and to
assimilate . it to the regular army, to the
extent of taking it out of the designation
of "other forces," which appears, in the
following article of war, the basis of Dem
ing's apllcatlon for a writ of habeas cor
pus: â¢ ...

THE HAGUE, April 20.â The condition
of Queen Wllhelmina is pracUcally un
changed. She does not lose conscious
ness, and has taken a yttle more nour
ishment.
The Prince Consort and the Queen's
physician left Castle Loo for a. short
time to-day. This is regarded as a fa
vorable sign.
LONDON, April 21.â The Dutch Cabinet,
cables the Brussels correspondent of
the Standard, will meet next Monday to
discuss the regency, which will be en
trusted to the Queen's mother.
From Castle Loo the correspondent of
the Daily Mail wires that Queen Wll
helmina's temperature remains at 103 de
grees, and that no complications are
teared before next Wednesday. Her Maj
esty's physicians, continues the corre
spondent, profess to be a shade more
hopeful.
To illustrate her Majesty's conscious
ness Saturday, it is related that, remem
bering that that day was the Prince Con
sort's birthday she ordered the baking of
certain cakes for distribution among the
children of the royal household and the
school children of Apeldoorn. The Queen,
r sa.ys the correspondent, is incapable of
taking any nourishment except beef tea
and other fluids, and these only in small
quantities. The Dutch doctors are puz
zled at the failure of the court physicians
to discover typhoid fever earlier. For
some time previous to her breakdown last
Monday the Queen lost her rosy color and
complained of headaches. Once, recenUy,
while sketching in Loo Park she fainted.
The correspondent goes on to say that
the present deplorable situation has by
no means added to Prince Henry's popu
larity. The sluggish Dutch press, ab
sorbed in Boer affairs, devotes amazingly
small space to the subject which en
grossed the nation's attention. No news
paper has yet devoted an editorial to the
Queen's health.
"I have just learned," adds the Daily
Mail correspondent, "that her Majesty is
enjoying a refreshing sleep.
"Prayers are being offered in all
churches to-day for Prince von Wied, the
son of the late King of Holland's sister.
He is mentioned as a possible successor
to the throne in the event of her Majes
ty's death.
"Looking at the palace amid the beau
tiful spring scenery it is difficult to be
lieve sinister rumors which are ailoat. At
an adjoining table in the hotel sit General
Roessinger, the Queen's _ secretary, and
other household officials, chatting mer
rily, as if in contradiction of the disquiet
ing rumors."

Ian was one of the most unattrac
tive irttbe republic. Both towns
were nestled in the main Cordil
lera and were about fifty miles
from the Pacific seaboard.
Quesaltenango was handsome
ly built and well paved. The
town had a richly decorated
cathedral and a magnificent City
Hall. The residents devoted most
of their attention to the manufac
turing of cotton and woolen fab
rics. Their town was 115 miles
northwest cf Guatemala City.
Amatitlaivs unattractiveness
was due to the mud huts which
housed io.coo inhabitants. The
latter consisted principally of in
dustrious mulattoes and Zamboes.
Amatitlan had pretty surround
ings. The town was built by
the lake of the same name, one of
the principal bodies of water in
the republic.
Guatemala has not been as
much a sufferer from earthquakes
as from volcanic eruptions. The
latter comprise several sad chap
ters in the history of the republic
and twice destroyed leading cities
of the country. There are about
six actiye volcanoes in Guatemala,
the most noted being the Volcan
de Agua, or Water Volcano
which destroyed the city of old
Guatemala by a deluge of .water in 1ML

Antigue, was destroyed by the same vol
cano in 1774, and the town built on the
ruins Is now a comparatively unlmportani

General Meyer and Party

Delegates at Pretoria \ Have
Full Power to Complete
Negotiations.
BALMORAL, Saturday, April 19.âGen

the Orange Free State forces,' State Secre
tary Reitz of the Transvaal and the other
members of their party arrived here last
night and this morning proceeded to the
north. They were accompanied by a Brit
ish escort, and it is their intention to con
sult with the J3oers in the field.
PRETORIA, April 20.â General Dewet
has gone to Heilbron, Orange River Col
ony; Genera.1 Botha, the Transvaal com
mander in chief, has gone to Vryheid,
Transvaal; and General Delarey, together
with Steyn. ex-President of the Orange
Free State, has gone to Klerksdorp,
Transvaal. They have arranged to meet
the Burghers at different rendezvous
and submit the British terms. It is be
lieved the^. Transvaalers will everywhere
accept the terms,, as they are in no way
anxious for a winter campaign. The only
difficulty likely to occur will be, it is
thought, with the Orange Free Staters,
many of whom are expected to prove re
calcitrant.
In the meantime there will be no cessa
tion of hostilities. The delegates are ex
pected back to Pretoria the. middle of
May, and in anticipation of their return
they have given orders here for new
clothes, provisions, etc.
LONDON April 21.â The Pretoria corre
spondent or the Standard cables that
there is good reason to believe a tentative
agreement has been arrived at which will
prove mutually cordial and lead to an
early cessation of hostilities.
The Utrecht correspondent of the Dally
Mail says it is recognized there that the
Boer delegates at Pretoria have full
powers to negotiate without reference to
the Boer leaders in Europe, who have no
real influence on the peace negotiations.

If that theory of the disturbance be correct, the
situation is much, more dangerous than it would be
were the rebels nothing more than the survivors of
the Boxer insurrection. The Boxers represented the
reactionary sentiment in China, the superstitions and
the ignorance* of the lowest classes of the popula
tion, but Sun Yat Sen. represents the progressive sen-
The leader of the rebels is. said to be Dr. Sun Yat
Sen, who is known as a progressive Chinaman. He
is the son of a rich merchant in"Honolulu and was
educated there and at Hongkong as a physician. He
has spent much time in the United States, Great
Britain and in Continental Europe and is in sympathy
with western progress. Some years ago, while living
in China, he was suspected of conspiring against the
Dowager Empress and fled for his life. It is believed
that while in this country and in England he managed
to raise a large sum of money, for revolutionary pur
poses; and the belief receives confirmation from the
report that he is the agitator and the leader of the re
bellion which has now become so formidable over a
large part of the huge empire.
Only the most meager information has been given
out concerning the situation. Up to this time the
troubles have been confined to Southern China, and
it has been suggested that' they are but spasmodic
outbreaks of the Boxers, whose members in the re
mote provinces have not learned of the lesson admin
istered in North China and around the capital. Were
that the case it is not likely the movement would be
of much significance to the world, but of late a new
theory has been advanced to account for the troubles.
It is said by some close students of Chinese affairs
that the leaders of the rebellion are in no wise asso
ciated with the Boxers, are not opposed to foreigners,
but are fighting for the purpose of overthrowing the
Government and establishing a genuine-Chinese ad
ministration in place of the "Tartar dynasty that now
holds the throne. ,
DISPATCHES from Canton to the effect that
the rebels are reported to have captured Nan
Ning, an important city in the province of
Kwang-si; that the telegraph wires between Canton
and cities in the disturbed provinces beyond Wu
Chow have been cut and all communication inter
rupted, confirm former reports that the rebellion is
much more serious than the Chinese Government has
been willing to admit. % Of course, where definite in
formation is denied, there always arise exaggerated
rumors, but after making every allowance for exag
geration, it is evident the disturbance could not have
been so long* continued nor coujd have involved so
wide a territory had it not been caused by something
much more like a formidable rebellion than a mere
insurrection. ;
Possibly it may strike the average American that a
mere fancy dress ball was not worth the expenditure
of so much talent and labor as this display evidently
required. It must be remembered, however, that any
thing worth doing at all is worth doing well. Â¦ /The
significance of the festival is that it shows how France
achieves and maintains . her artistic supremacy. She
plans for it and she works for it. She is never willing
to let anything having an 'artist'ic suggestion fall into
botch work., She. does not leave. to< 'amateur patrons
of art the conduct of art. matters. Doubtless her art
costs her deaf, but she, gets her reward from the na-:
tions that are not so wise as herself in that respect;
and so even from a pecuniary standpoint the Garvarni
festival will probably prove to have been" immensely
successful, not only' for the monument fund but for
all Paris.',,;.-; \','-;\'; ' %'{, . : \ ;./r 1 ' ' - .. .'
The object of the festival was that of raising money
for the erection of a monument-to Garvarni.s.When a
masquerade was decided upon the arrangement of it
was not ieft to the hazard of individual fancy in the
selection of costumes. The artist Gerome was chosen
to direct the costuming, and he had the assistance of
a committee" of fifty of the foremost painters and
sculptors, in France. Under their direction 4890 per
sons were dressed in appropriate costumes, each rep
resenting one, of. Garvarni's caricatures. Among the
conspicuous figures were 200 actors and actresses of
the French stage, who represented kings, queens and
courtiers. A distinguished group of.artists and liter
ary men presented the characters of Balzac, Berlioz,
De Musset, George Sand, Victor Hugo, Rachel, L,a
martine and, in short, all the notables of Garvarni's
time who were pictured in his works. Finally the
entire corps de ballet, of the Opera and the Opera
Comique, dressed as white pierrots^ formed a special
ballet to enhance the glory of the general display.
PARIS has just been giving the world an object
lesson in the art of arranging a masquerade,
and has done it in a way that has excited the
admiration of all beholders and enabled space writers
to make a huge sum of money by sending accounts
of it to the outer regions of civilization. As an illus
tration ol how to do artistic things artistically instead
of amateurishly, the festiyar seems to have been bril
liantly successful, and to that extent is= interesting
even to persons who are utterly indifferent to ordinary
functions of the kind.
THE CHINESE REBELS.
A PARISIAN FESTIVAL.
Germany's infant colonies are rather costly, for,
according to a recent statement, the total annual reve
nue of the eight "protectorates" under the rule of the
Kaiser is only $2,000,000, and the Reichstag has had
to vote $7,500,000 to support .them. Even at those
figures, however, the Germans have no right to com
plain. The Philippines alone cost us a good deal
more than that. . Â¦ ',
The Republican clubs at San Jose commend
ed the economical administration of Governor
Gage and in the same paragraph passed up a
bouquet to the last Legislature, commending
also Us economy. Now, Gage vetoed all the
measures passed by the Legislature as far as
he could, and he was at open war with that
body. If the one Is commended the other
must needs be condemned, and the reverse.
But the San Jose convention was equal to the
emergency, and j throwing the record out of
doors, it calmly commended both the execu â¢
tive and the Legislature for one and the
same thing, wherein they were acting on lines
directly opposite. .

convention was packed full of Gage delegates,
who.mlKht or might not stand^an .Investiga;

professors stirred up a lot of loud enthusiasm.
Then the harmony flute was played and the

would be rank treason to the G. O. P. for any
one to say one unlovely word about any one
else. Ontfe under the spell, the suggestion
that there should J)e no disagreeable scrutiny
of credentials found ready acceptance. Then

selves in a heavy minority, with the result
that they became cbwed.- Then came the let

vote of 12 to 7. If the vote in the committee

will make the nomination, Mr. â¢ Gage's doom
is sealed.
The resolution of commendation is an inter
esting study. It praises Gage for fearlessness
and economy and lauds the Reoublican mem
bera of the last Legislature for economy and
conservatism. Now, the Governor's alleged
economy consisted of vetoing a great many
appropriation bills passed by the Legislature.
If he was economical the Legislature was ex.
travagant. If the Legislature was conserva
tive and' economical the Governor was a po
litical trickster, vetoine needed appropriations
in order to secure a low tax rate and thua
making a demagogic play to the people for a
re-election.
The Fresno Republican declares that nobody
who helped write and nobody who voted for
the resolution expected It to be. taken by any
body as .meaning what it says. This is a
frank confession, but what else could an hon
est man say?
Merced Sun- (Dem.):
The fight Is on In the Republican camp, with
Gage against the field. About three-fourths of
the Republican papers In the State are against
Gage, and they are saying he is unfit to be
Governor, and ought not to be nominated. But
Gage has the push behind him. and it's dollars
to doughnuts he will get the nomination. The
bosses are for Gage, and the bosses always con
trol Republican conventions. Ordinarily the
bosses .would be afraid to nominate Gage,
with sentiment so firmly against him in his
own party, but they are depending upon. 'party
loyalty after the nomination Is made. Â¦Â¦
Colusa Sun (Dem.):
Perhaps there has never' been a' man Gov
ernor of any State in the Union so universally
condemned by the people of all parties as
Henry T. > Gage. Nearly every newspaper ol
his own party la opposed to his nomination, and
yet every one expresses a fear that he may
get It. The Fresno Republican closes a column
of scathing invective with the following sen
tence: "But they cannot afford to indorse, nor
to do anything less than positively to disclaim
responsibility for the administration of Henry
T. Gage, by the grace of Democratic blunder
ing and Republican misunderstanding- Governor
of California.
Fresno Democrat (Dem.):
i i The Herald of Los Angeles, which U one of
the very few Republican papers in the Stata
supporting the candidacy of Gage as Governor,
had black-letter headlines over the report of
the league convention, 'reading, ' "Administra- â¢
tlon of Gage Is Heartily Commended." Tne
language of the .resolutions, relating 'to Gage
was as brief as it could be made short of ignor
ing him, and the words were these: "Third â
We commend the able, economical and fearless
administration of the Republican Governor of
California. Henry T. Gage." In point of fact,
the proposed qualification of the commendation
with the word "warmly" was eliminated by a
committee vote ot 12 to 7, with 6 absent. Bat
of this there is no intimation in the Herald.
â¢And so his Excellency, after the adoption of
the resolution?; simply found "himself damned
with faint praise. '^ . . . , . ..
San Benito Advance (Ind.):
The coming municipal election at San Jose
will have a great effect on the gubernatorial
campaign. In the appointment of Mackenzie aa
Harbor Commissioner Gage made a direct bid
for the delegates from Santa Clara County to
the State convention. The appointment aroused
all the slumbering . hostility to Mackenzie and
his political methods. Greeninger is Macken
zie's candidate for Mayor, and every effort la
being put forth by the Good Government
League . to encompass his defeat. The league
has the assistance of the two newspapers, the
Herald and Mercury, : which pour hot shot dally
into the Mackenzie camp. It also has the as
sistance J of that faction which has remained
loyal to Jim Rea, who was dethroned by Mac
kenzle. All signs at the present time point
to the downfall of Mackenzie, and If this be
accomplished a delegation hostile to Gage's
nomination will be 'sent to the State convention.
The appointment of Mackenzie -was a political
mistake that will probably result in Gage' i
withdrawal from the canvass, or defeat of. nil
ambition. Â¦ .

and independent newspapers: - - â¢ ,-.; â¢ ',.'.'Â» ,,!,..'â

Oakland Enquirer (Ind. Rep.):
THERE was not much feature to trade last week.
The important staples showed little change,
there was no particular activity in speculative
arcles, and aside from the Cuban legislation in Con
jress and the proposed formation of the hardware
rust, with a capitalization of $120,000,000, there was
rery little to attract attention. The country's bank
Jearings showed a loss of 16.7 per cent from the cor
-esponding week last year, with New York, Boston,
Philadelphia, Pittsburg and Baltimore in the column
>f losses. At the same time, however, tbre aggregate
:learings amounted to $2,541,841,000, the largest for.
nonths, which would apparently show a gain instead
if a loss in the country's business for the week. The
ailures were 261, against 203 last year.
The staples showed more or less irregularity. Sugar
;nd coffee were weak, the latter declining to within a
lixteenth of the lowest record. Footwear shipments
bra the New England factories fell off, but most of
â¢hem were running on fair orders, principally for fall
ielivery. There was a good demand for woolen
foods, and continued activity in iron and steel was
â¢eported. Provisions, notably hog products, butter
md eggs, advanced, while beef and hogs were distin
fuished by the highest prices and smallest receipts for
rears. Wheat went up and down, being purely a
veather market, but the general tone was firm. The
*inter wheat is undoubtedly suffering from continued
Iry weather, and in the Southwest, according to all
â¢eports, not over half a crop can be raised, even with
iavorable conditions from now on. The crop in the
Korthwcst is reported all right, and there has been
jo serious damage in the Central West The exports
jf wheat and flour for the week were 4,118,000 bush
;ls, against 5,306.000 for the same week last year. The
.mposition of an import duty, of about 3 cents per
bushel by the British Government produced little,
tffect in this country, as it was generally agreed that
â¢jreat Britain, and not the United States, would have
:o pay the duty, and that it was the Britons' funeral,
aot ours. The railroad earnings continued to make a
jood showing, having thus far in April increased 6.9
per cent over 1901 and 16.3 per cent over 1900. Build
ing operations all over the country are reported more
tctive than for a decade, and lumber, steel structural
:naterial and builders' hardware are in urgent demand
!n consequence. The jobbers and retailers all over
:he country reported an active demand and continue
:o send in better reports than the importers and heavy
wholesalers.
The condition of * the crops is now the leading
; eature in California. It is about this time of the year
:hat the business community wants to. know how the
:rops are likely to turn out The prospects continue
jxcellent, but though the rains have come along all
right thus far, some sections are reporting a deficiency
of moisture and a crust on the surface of the ground.
"Tiis is especially true of the hay sections, and, while
>-.e crop in any event will be ample for all ordinary
/-;eds, it will probably not be as enormous as was
anticipated a month ago. One or two varieties of
iruits, too, are not looking quite as well, owing to the
jnusually cool spring, though the season has thus far
oeen singularly free from frost and no complaints of
my kind are heard from the fruit-growers. It is too
tarly yet to make any predictions regarding the grape
md wine output Taken as a whole, the crop,pros
pects are as good as they ever were at this season and
much better than the average, and no scarcity in any
thing is yet apparent. .
New York has been so much gratified over the
eistt of Prince Henry of Prussia that there is. now
i movement on foot to ask the Prince of Wales' to
tome over. It seems that every time royalty strikes
ihe city there is ~ such a rush of visitors that there's
millions in it. ' r

How far the Southern men who favor protection
cah.be induced \o support the new movement, re
mains to be seen.^ It will be remembered that dur-.
ing the Cleveland free trade agitation 'tKe. Sputhern
ers aided him vigorously during the- campaign, but
after] his election some of the ablest of the Southern
Senators refused to support the Wilson tariff. The
Southern people, in fact, are suffering from the
effects of unnatural politics. They. have allied them
selves with Democracy when their industrial inter
ests are bound up with Republicanism. It is high
time for them to put an end to such a condition of
affairs, and should the reorganizers carry out the
free trade movement there will be a good opportun
ity for them to redeem their States from the Bour
bon alliance.
Almost simultaneous with the announcement of
the executive committee there appeared in conserva
tive Democratic papers of the East a strong clamor
for an anti-tariff .campaign. It seems almost as if
they, were acting in concert, so promptly did one
after another take up the chorus. Repeated efforts
were made in Washington- to get the party to make
a free trade demonstration, and while they were by
no means successful, the spirit of the movers has not
been dampened.
Referring to those abortive attempts the Washing
ton correspondent of the Boston Herald says:
"There are a sufficient number of conservative Dem
prats who desire to, advance the tariff > issue to the
front and to couple it with' an anti-imperialist plank
to make the nucleus of a new Democratic organiza
tion. They' feel that it is absolutely essential that
those members and leaders of the party who want
to face toward the future . shall definitely separate
from those who are determined to face to the rear.
They would be gladif the Louisiana and other mem
bers who insist upon supporting Republican prin
ciples 'should frankly declare themselves to be mem
bers ot the Republican party. At present their only
use in politics is as assassins of Democratic policies.
Their natural leader is Mr. Gorman."
â¢ The chairman of the Congressional committee,
Mr. Griggs of Georgia, is reputed to be a Bryanite,
but even if that be so the victory is virtually in the
hands of the. opposition, for with such an executive
committee in charge of th*e ; work of the campaign
and handling the sack tHe Bryanite chairman can be
hardry more than a figurehead.
The completeness of the victory- for the reorgan
izers in Â¦ the recent struggle in .the Democratic Con
gressional;caucus; is made, evident by the P men se
lected for the' executive -committee to manage the
approachingi Congressional' campaign. The commit
tee is to consist of Benjamin T. /Cable of Illinois,
Lewis Nixon and Daniel S. Larhont of New York,
Richard Olney of .Massachusetts, David Overmeyer
of Kansas and Thomas -Tagfgart' of Indiana.
DESPITE the development of a strong protec
tion sentiment among the Democrats of the
Southern States, the dominant element of
Democracy seems determined to ally the organization
with theNorthern free-traders and make a fight this
fall and in 1904 upon the tariff. ,';
A TARIFF^ CAMPAIGN.
The Board of Public Works .has created another

agency of the City Attorney the board has been in

Santa Barbara Independent:
Friends of Senator Thomas Flint who are
most interested in his fight for the Republican
nomination for Governor . claim ' that if tha
State convention Â¦ were to be held to-morrow
Mr. 'â¢â¢ Gage could not muster sufficient strength
for a Â¦ renomination. ." They offer the following
figures to prove this assertion : /
Tirey L. Ford having announced his with
drawal from the race for Attorney General,
the candidate of the State machine will be
Arthur G. : Fisk of San Francisco.
Auburn Republican:
- Lieutenant Governor Jacob H. Neft is being
favorably mentioned as the probable Â¦ presiding
officer of the Republican- State convention. To
Republicans who favor a truly representative
leader of the party no man in the State will
be more acceptable than Neft. His record is a
spotless one, marked by long devotion to Re
publican principles, unflagging zeal and inter
est to advance the party, free and untram
meled in his actions, true to his convictions,'
firm . as adamantine, and commanding esteem :
and confidence throughout the State.
Pomona Times: Â¦
Â¦ Dr. Hilgard's letter lays him open to the
severest criticism in several particulars, but
we'll -point to only a few. He knows that a
fertilizer control- law is for the protection of
the tillers of the soil and makers of honest
fertilizers, and . not for Governors nor State
educators, however upright and Honorable they
may be.
In face of the fact that ' several . thousand
fruit growers and soil tillers, who have learned
by actual experience what they need and what
will benefit them, and who urged the Governor
to approve a bill that In some measure, at
least, would meet their wants, it ill becomes
Dr. Hilgard to say they don't know what they
want and that/ what they asked for Is worse
than no law at all. : A great many of the fruit
growers and tillers of the soil are highly edu
cated men, with chemical and other knowl
edge obtained by experience, and Dr. Hilgard
knows this to be^ true; yet he seems to glory
in having induced a Governor to withhold (not
veto) his approval of a bill, though not per
fect, which they Implored him to approve.
' Dr. Hilgard said he would warn Professor
Cook to do or not to do what? To avoid doing
the very thing he (Dr. H.)' did in the Pomona
Institute meeting, viz.: inject partisan, politics
into it. .Whatever Dr. Hilgard may have
meant in this manifestly partisan letter to a
partisan of Governor Gage, it betrays a dis
position to domineer over Professor A. J. Cook,
a subordinate to him in the university em
ploy, 1 but one of the ablest of educators, fair
est of men, best of citizens, and a man whom
it is an honor and pleasure to know, also a
man who ' used silent diplomacy to avoid dis
cussion of Dr. Hilgard's manifestly partisan
paper â a paper, which, according to his letter
given herewith, "exonerates Gage fully so far
as the last session Is concerned'.'; a paper that,
taking- Dr. Hilgard at his word, should have
been excluded from the institute, because of
its defense of a candidate for Governor.
Perhaps the university is forced to do poli
tics; if it is It ought to be fair enough to let
others do, without its criticism, what they will
do anyhow â try to defeat Gage's renomination,
and falling In that try to defeat him at the
polls, a tribunal where citizens may freely ex
press their wishes. . â¢
. As to Senator Currier, he Is a fruit grower,
a general farmer, and a man whose public and
private character cannot be smirched by sucn
undefined allusions as Dr. HilrÂ»rd makes, nor
by any of the Gage-Burns partisans.
Fortuna Advance:
The Call states that George A. Knight is
Elated by the friends of Governor Gage for
chairman of. the Republican State convention.
The Call Is making a heavy fight against Gage
and will, of course, oppose Knight. Lieutenant
Governor Neff will be Knight's opponent for
chairman of the convention.
Ontario Record-Observer:
There are a few papers in the State with
temerity enough to openly espouse the cause
of Henry T. Gage for Governor to succeed
himself.- The editors of some of these very
few papers are already beginning to rear up on
their hind legs and rend the air with violence
because the other papers, having ooinions ot
their own. do not coincide with the few.
Those paDers that choose to trail with the
Burns-Gage crowd are welcome to do so; no
one Is going to try to stop them. The papers
that are maklne Gage's fight should be en
couraged to whoop It up as loudly as. they
canâ they'll need all the bluster they can
scare up. But bluster will not make votes,
and the voters are tired of the in
cumbent, and if the party must put up this
man'] name again the quiet thinking citi
zen will see to it that some other man gets
the vote that will land lÂ»:m In the Governor's
chair. Give us almost any one â but not Gage.
Bed Bluff Sentinel:
Honest primaries are a death blow to boss
rule, and if delegates to the Republican State
Convention are so chosen Governor Gage will
find how much he is despised by the people
for betraying his office into the hands of the
bosses. The Gage papers, which are very few and
I far bttween, are making a desperate effort to
belittle the opposition to him, which is grow
ing like a swelling tide, and it is a question
whether his name will ever go before the Re
publican State Convention.
Santa Ana Herald: â¢
A few weeks ago there was a /beautiful and
simultaneous editorial smattering among sev
eral papers of the State in favor of the renom
ination of Governor Gage. Of late the chorus
has been strangely subdued. What's the mat
ter? Waiting for grease? It seemed like a
well-developed case of mind reading or wire
less hypnotism before. All the papers unbur
dened themselves at practically the same time.
Funny, wasn't it? Â¦ ;. .

Selena Star:
The Napa Register takes a position against
the renomination of the Governor which la
logical and conservative. That paper deems it
Inadvisable and poor politics to nominate a
man upon whom the party is divided. The
Register will support Gage, however, should he
be nominated. That the party is divided on
this important- political problem there can be
no question. Can and will the factions unite

The plan is a good one and is in excellent hands.
It deserves well of the public and should have uni
versal support.
The benefits to be gained by a general acceptance
of the plan and co-operation with the committee are
that the number of charity solicitors, will be dimin
ished and merchants will be . less . frequently ap
proached by them; that those who are worthy will
carry with them a guarantee which will entitle them
to a hearing, while the unworthy will have no such
indorsement; that the various charities of the city will
be led to the adoption of business methods; and,
finally, as the Review says, "there will be established
in the. community a group of person? whose interest
'is not confined to any one benevolent.' institution and
whose effort it will be to bring into an organized
system the hitherto unorganized charities of the city."
It is to be borne in mind that the indorsement of
the committee is not designed to be a recommenda
tion that money be contributed nor a request for
support, but solely as a certificate that the purposes
and methods of the society asking contributions are
worth}' of support from all who- choose to give it.
That much having been effected, the protection of
the community from unworthy charity solicitors will
be ample provided the liberal and charitable people
of the city act in harmony with the plan and refuse
contributions to any charity solicitor who does not
bear credentials from the indorsement committee.
The plan having been submitted to the members
of the association, it was approved by 489 out of the
500 members who took enough interest in the sub
ject to vote upon it. Thereupon there were ap
pointed to represent on the "indorsement commit
tee" â the Merchants' Association â Andrew M. Davis,
Horace Davis and John F. Merrill. From the. Asso
ciated Charities 'there were appointed Osgood Put
nam and Miss Jessica Peixotto. These members met
and completed the committee by the selection of Her
bert W. Lewis and Rev. D. O. Crowley as repre
sentatives of the charities at large.
As a means of working toward the desired end it
was proposed by the committee that there be estab
lished a charities indorsement committee made up of
three representatives from the Merchants' Association,
two from the Associated Charities and two persons
identified with charities at large, the latter two chosen,
in the first instance, by the other five members; of
the committee; and that the members individually be,
asked to give only to those organizations which
should be indorsed by this central committee.
The statement, which was written for the Review
by Katherine C. Felton, gives a brief â¢account of the
efforts made to devise some plan which would insure
adequate support to the legitimate charities of the
city, while making impossible the continuance of the
illegitimate and the inefficient. The methods which
have proven successful in other cities were carefully
considered by a committee appointed by the Mer
chants' Association, and the conclusion reached that,
"while the establishment of a central fund is the end
to be worked for, the time is not yet ripe for it."
SOME time ago The, Call had occasion to ex
pose the operations in this city of a professional
"charity promoter" and to point 'out the -evil
effects of tolerating that class of professionals. , In
cidentally, in the course of that exposure, it was de
veloped that a considerable number of persons make
a large private profit for themselves by "preying"
as it were upon the charitable instincts of the people.
At that time The Call urged the merchants of the
city to take some steps to protect themselves and the
community from the activities of such persons, and
it is gratifying to note in the April number of the
Merchants' Association -Review an announcement of
what has been done to that end.

There are two kinds of happiness â one tempo
rary and the other permanent. All vice Is due
to attempts to get temporary, pleasure, which
is but a short cut to happiness. The better
kind is that which leaves room for more and
is found only in the pure heart and a clean
nervous system. The basis of that happiness
it to do something.- Indolence, gambling,'licen
tiousness and vulgarity are the open doors
through which all vice comes. Man should be
not only true to himself, but true to the man
who is coming after him. He should form such
cleanly habits in his youth that they will leave
no ill effects in his after life. Then only will
he know what constitutes true happiness, for
which he must ever strive to attain. ,

Dr. David Starr Jordan, LL.D., presi

interesting lecture last night at Bethel A.
M. E. Church on the subject, "The
Strength of Being Clean." Dr. Jordan
prefaced his remarks ( by an allusion to
the men of the colored race who had
achieved distinction their having
led pure lives: He argued that true suc

after lies in a man being clean of heart

For two hours the important question
was* RvritqtPti Â»-Â»stil > niÂ«- in th* unanimous
verdict that the question ,bc held and no
action taken until the r headquarters of
the Chorus Girls' Union in New York ran
be heard from. In the meantime, the
girls, thoroughly indignant, will continue
to smile while the lights are on, but will
grind their tefth in the dark and breathe
vengeance against managers.
"Who Is that little, weazened creature
who failed to respond? Bouncer. ; show
her the. door. We want only interested
members to vote on this."
"All the same I don't, hang my stun
ning shape in the dressing-room after
the show and go down O'Farrell street
like an animated lamp-post."
"Hussey, you â "
"Girls, are we to stand this insult?"
interrupted a pretty girl just from New
York.- "Must we furnish, our life his
tory in order to carry an old tin spear?
Most serious of all, will We submit to
this tyranny which would compel us to
give public evidence, without doubt a
sure sidetrack to any moneyed chap upon
matrimony bent? I say. let us strike
first. All those in favor of strike say
'aye.' " Â¦*
"Say, Maudle, were you there when the
Egyptians built the pyramid?" :
"No; and I didn't come over in the
ark, either. Ilk > a certain peroxide bute
not more than a mile away."
"What's that? " You're going to give
In? Goody; 1 see your finishâ they'll send
you to the Old Ladies' Home."
"You needn't talk; you'd go to the
museum, and i that's no Joke, either."
"Such tyranny!" "Nasty old things!"
"Find out my right age? Well, I guess
nit!"
. "For reference, huh! Not while I'm in
my right mind." -
"Well, I'll resign before they get me
toâ"
After due consideration a special meet-
Ing was called Friday night by the chair
man of the Chorus Girls' Union, which
was organized here a few weeks ago,
and during the rally the age question was
handled in a spirited manner, the sub
ject being . argued both pro and con,
weighing the good of this, the evil of
that, resulting at last in a unanimous
and decided "Never!''
To the female chorus: 'Objections have been
made by a number of the chorus girls to give
their correct age's. As this rule is Imperative,
that the age of every girl must be Inserted In
her contract, you are requested to Immediately
give your age to the management before tu
morrow night, otherwise your contract will be
canceled.
A new rule at Fischer's Theater has
caused consternation. Merry maidens
must tell their age! A general strike is
in : contemplation among me frout-iow
fairies in consequence. The cause of the
trouble is this: Some of the New York
managers have a clause In their contracts
by which all actors and actresses en
gaged by them agree to insert their cor
rect : age, for reference only. Being in
affiliation with one of the New Jfork
managers, the management of Fischer's
Theater has been making a futile effort
to enforce this clause, the first intimation
of it being a bulletin posted a few days
ago.
The awful proclamation, which threat
ens to cause an epidemic of retrousse
noses in the chorus, is as follows:

to Strike if the Order Is-
Not Withdrawn.

An unusually severe hailstorm struck the
water front about 10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, and for a few minutes hailstones were
piled up in large masses on docks and vessels.
The storm belt did not extend far into the
city, but seemed to expend its energy in narrow
limits. As soon as the Bun came out largo
pools of water were formed 13 numerous places
by the melting of the ice.

Among the passengers was Right Rev. Bishop
Chatron, who has been thirty years in Japan,
with headquarters at Tokio. He is on his way
to Paris and will stop with the Brothers of
Mary at 1417 Howard street. Commander B.
Christian, R. N., and Commander Perry Garet,

list being as follows:
Favored by exceptionally fine weather, the
Occidental and Oriental liner Doric came In
yesterday afternoon two days ahead of schedule
time. One day was gained between Yoko
hama and Honolulu and another between the
latter port and San Francisco. From Hong
kong to San Francisco the trip was made in
twenty-six days seventeen hours; from Yoko
hama to Honolulu the time was nine days
ee\'en hours and twenty-five minutes, and from
Honolulu to San Francisco five days seventeen
hours and twenty-eight minutes.

All those who were out on Saturday on
the trial trip of the big freighter Alaskan,
constructed by the Union Iron Works for
the American-Hawaiian Steamship Com
pany, were loud in their praises of the
vessel. The Alaskan is the largest vessel
of her class constructed on the Pacific
Coast. Her tonnage is more than 14,000,
with a carrying capacity of 12,000 tons
dead weight.
For six hours the Alaskan steamed
about the bay at full speed. The contract
called for ten and a half knots* speed,
but twelve was the point reached. Her
contract horsepower was S00O, but 10 per
cent more was developed. George C.
Dearborn, president of the company; Cap
tain Metcalf, suveyor for Lloyds'; Mr.
Stewart, the engineer surveyor for
Lloyds', and a number of invited guests
were aboard, and complete satisfaction
was expressed with the working of the
ship. The vessel minded her helm like a
yacht.
The Alaskan has a small cargo aboard
and will sail this morning for Honolulu,
thence to New York, and will be put in
the trade between New York and this
coast. Captain Banfield, her commander,
expects to leave the wharf this morning
at 5 o'clock, adjust his compasses and let
the vessel have her first taste of the briny
deep.

The Whitelaw "Reids . cannot say when
they go back East that Californians do
not know how to entertain. 1 They have
certainly been feted handsfcmely, and if
they had attended all the luncheons and
dinners they have been asked to the "rest
cure" would be their only hope. Now that
Mr. Reid dresses so immaculately in a
conventional frock coat he will no longer
be dubbed "the man milliner of Journal
ism." People who have known him a
long time In the East say that, he used to
go about the streets in a black velvet
coat and permitted his necktie to float
out upon the zephyr breeze witlT the
abandon of a genius. In fact, such care
lessness was most un-understandable to
the cotillon chap, who never commits
those social crimes.
Jack Casserly, however, is earning the
title Mr. Reid has given up. He appeared
at Mr. Bowie's garden party at San Ma
teo Saturday dressed exactly as he
wishedâ in a business suit, leaving his
frock coat at home with the independence
of the Vanderbilt who spoke so impoli
ticly of the public. Mrs. Casserly wore
an exquisite summer gown, with showers
of* lace, and the wearer looked wondei*
tully well in it.

how that genuine pleasure goes with the
Robinson hospitality. When those old
Southern families open their doors they
are euro to entertain with that kindly

them thoroughly enjoyable. . The tea-yes
terday was very simple and informal,
while everything was arranged in excel

prised the decorations. Army officers

completed by a 3ainty string of pearls. Â¦
Catherine Herrin wore a clinging gown
Just suited to her splendid figure. The
material was a â¢ soft gray crepe, closely
lucked, with the yoke on the skirt and

The gown was collarless. A pearl neck

A. H. Pape did some sensational snooty
Ing with a rifle yesterday at the Harbor
View range of Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club. He entered for the 100-shot com
petition and broke all previous records on
any range or target.
His 100 shots counted 450 or averaged
on the 4%-lncb. ring. The last fifty shots
counted 223, averaging on a 4.46-lnch bulls
eye. The 100 shots were In the 12- inch
bullseye, while 93 were In the 8-inch ring,
or regulation Creedmoor hullseye. If
counted on a German point target the
100 shots total 226, or 26 points more than
a 2-point average. The shooting was off
hand on Columbia target.' Kach shot in
Pape's appended score gives size of ring

The contest at Oakland was called at
the end of the second inning on account
of rain. Oakland was leading by / a score,
of 5 to 2, and. the Ponies were probably
saved from another , drubbing. Schmidt
was doing slab duty, and Kane opposed
him. Bobby McHale missed the boat,
so . Chimmie .Whalen , took his place at
bat,' and, to the. wonderment of the
crowd, led off with a' clean hit past third.
Clay H. Howbacker, in - behalf of the
rooters, presented the Oakland team
with a box of r bats, accompanying his
feat with . an enthusiastic speech. . The
men took the sticKs' and began to pound
in a few runs, which delighted the-popu
lace immensely. Pete Lohman was given
a* baby bat decorated- with red, white and
blue ribbons. '.A fan .remarked . that in
case Pete did not land the pennant the
cranks would use it in beating a tattoo
on .his head. ' Â¦ ,- .

SAN FRANCISCO.
San Franciscos' erratic infield work lost
them, the game. Meredith pitched splen
did ball, and was in the game from the
first to the last. Oakland fielded in bril
liant style, and batted the ball at pre
cisely, the proper Chrisiall
passed too many men to first, but the
Ponies could not hit him when men were
waiting" to score. -
The local field was thoroughly, punc
tured at the outset. Walters got a
scratch hit to first, .and little Mohler
sacrificed. Walters easily , completed â¢ his
journey on Bone's fumble of Streib's
grounder, Streib taking second. 'Streib
was there when Shugart let Devereaux's
grounder pass him. Mohler's inneld sln
ble, Leahy's .wild \ throw and Streib's
scratch hit were the cause of â¢ another
Oakland tally in the third. .
The Ponies â¢ broke out 'of a walk in the
second. /Holly led. off with. a long double
to the right Held fence, and Delmas
scored him with a hot drive to right.
In the third Meredith was passed. Law
ler sent him up a turn with a single over
second. Holly preyed on ChrlstalTs gen
erosity, while a passed ball by Gorton
let Meredith in. ...
It kept on in a sort of see-saw way,
Oakland scoring during the third, fifth,
sixth, seventh and eighth rounds partly
by timely hitting and partly by the er
rors their -opponents were good enough to
make. The Ponies added three more to
their list in the fourth, seventh and
ninth. Sometimes it looked interesting,
and" the bunch in .both bleachers woufd
give vent to their pent-up feelings by
letting a few war-cries . escape, but it
was never*: really dangerous for the sub
urban -nine. â¢ . â¢
Dunleavy reeled off a pretty, drive for
three cushions in the sixth. It went
straight out between McHale Â¦ and Law
ler. and brought . in . auburn Bill Dever
eaux. Holly's drive looked 4 as good, as
Dunleavy's, but the local lad made only
two bases on it. Delmas performed . in
clever style with tne walloper, hitting
out a double and a clean single. Bone also
had his peepers working to a nicety, get
ting two hits. - j , .â¢ . ,
Â¦ Lawler made a' splendid running catch
of McCreedie's sharp fly In the fifth and
neatly doubled up Streib at the first sack
McCreedie's catch of McHale's drive iii
the ninth was also a great feat, and pos
sibly shut off a couple of runs. : Delmas
executed a clever Â¦ play when he, caught
Buck Francks stealing third after a sac
rifice during the third trial. The score* --
Fully 7500 humans were on the spot to
see the locals lose their fourth game.
Pome arrived in wagons, a few^lnwheel
barrowsAbut the majority developed their
leg muscles by doing a hot foot.' The sky
at times looked as though it would toss
cut a few juicy barrelfuls on those
who worked the bleachers overtime,: but
the multitude did not care. It was' there
to witness ay ball game, and had -the
pleasure of beholding one which, though
ragged in spots,' contained, a certain
amount of the ginger the "public says.it
would go miles to see.
Ponies ended their, second
I series of games yesterday at

HOMING PIGEONS RACE
THROUGH A RAINSTORM
There was a good breeze yesterday aft
ernoon in the channel and as the tide was
running out there was a considerable sea.
The Challenger, in charge of W. G. Mor
row, cruised from Sausalito, and her crew
had some practice in setting the spinna
ker and balloon Jib. Besides W. G. Mor
row there were on board Commodore R.
S. Bridginan, G. T. S. White, A. R. Has
klns, J. Follansbee, C. F. Austin and H.
H. Jenness. Though a good deal of water
came aboard, the sloop behaved beauti
fully in the choppy water
In addition to the Challenger the yawl
Royal and the sloop Halcyon of the San
Francisco Yacht Club were under way.
The yawls Arcturus and Spray and the
sloops Sappho and Harpoon of the Corin
thians, with the sloop Dixie of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club, were also out for a
cruise. Commodore R. S. Eridgman's
sloop Thetis is in commission. The crews
were hard at work yesterday on the
sloops Cygnus, Rover and Dewey. The
sloop Cygnus will be put on the beach at
Old Sausalito during the week, and will
be ready for the opening cruise next Sun
day. Â«
Charles _L. Fair has sold his gasoline
launch Lucero, which is said to have cost
him nearly $40,000, to the Alaska Commer
cial Company. She is most elaborately
and elegantly fitted up, having powerful
engines, an electric lighting and cooking
plant and handsome littings. It is said
the price for which she was sold is less
than her engines cost and considerably
less than she would have brought if
broken up and sold piecemeal. Her own
er made scarcely any use of her except
as a tender to his ark in Cordelia Slough
during the duck-shooting season.

NEWARK. N. J.. April 20.â The esti
mated number of persons at the Vails
fturg cycle track to-day was 6000. The
feature of the day was the quarter-mile
race, flying start, for professionals. It
was won by the national champion,
Frank Kramer, in 28 2-5 seconds. This
creates a new world's record. Floyd Mc-
Farland of San Jose, CaL, was second.
The old record was made by Dr. A. I.
Brown of Pecatur, 111., October 13, 1894.
In the five-mile handicap for profes
sionals both the national and the five
mile champions were beaten. Kramer
took the lead in the last lap, but in the
homestretch Fenn, the five-mile cham
pion, overhauled him. McFarland then
came fast from behind and managed to
beat them both out by a few inches.

The card presented to the patrons of
Union Coursing Park yesterday resulted
in as fine coursing as has been seen at
th.d grounds in many" months. The four
stakes offered , proved a strong attraction,
and, despite the hurtful influence of the
streetcar tie-up, were well patronized.
A. R. Curtis' Beacon took first honors
in the Champion stake, beating Horned-
Boy pointless in the' deciding course. The
fast blue courser proved easily the class
dog of the ctake, and his clever and rapid
work in the company of worthy op
ponents came In for favorable comment
Efeacon, to reach the final, had to dis
pose of such good ones as A. J. Martin,
Dewdrop and Merrimac, and in- each
trial took the decision quite handily.
Homer Boy, the runner-up, was a
strong factor- in the going, arfd until he
met defeat in the course with the Curtis
champion was an easy winner in his
trials. In the first round Homer Boy was
drawn with America, and ended the
course without allowing his opponent to
score. Following this he earned the flag
from fast Rector, a high-priced " candi
date for stake honors and a 2 to 1 fa
vorite for the course. The semi-final
found Â¦ Homer Boy on the card against
Palo Alto. Geary's dog ruled, choice at
1 to 2. In the run-up he showed much
speed over the Boy, and it looked .an
easy victory for him. With . honors
within easy reach, however, the great
sprinter evidenced a desire to ease up
in his work, and from that point he ran
a disappointing course. Homer Boy was
quick ; in taking advantage, and at the
finish was on the long end of an 8 tc 6
scare.
Harlean Gladys - won the open stake,
with Roman Athlete runner-up. The win
ner was favorite in all her trials, and
her victories were on merit. Roman Ath
lete proved a good investment for his
backers, beating Sofala and Cascade at
6 .to 3 and Sir Pasha at 3 to 1. Short
lenders made a good showing in the stake,'
thirteen taking honors from the favor
ites.
In the Reserve stake. Argyle beat Rich.
Argosy in the final by a score of 5 to 3.
The winner was backed off the board
Saturday.
Menlo Prince annexed Â¦ the puppy stake,
and proved a surprise to the wise ones.
He led and beat High Stepper â¢ at 4 to
1, outworked Sllevenamon at 5 to 3, and
af 5 to 2 won the stake from Otto.

During the morning there was a heavy
downpour of rain, which rendered the
course unfit for racing. Chairman Rambo
held the race until 1 o'clock, when, the
condition of the course remaining the
same, it was postponed until next Sun
day morning. The members of the
Garden City Wheelmen and of the Bay
' City Wheeimen were anxious to ride un
der the conditions as they found them.
Owing to the possibility of accidents, it
was deemed advisable to order the
postponement.
The riders provided themselves with
burlap covers for the journey home, and
presented an odd appearance on the
road.
The day was to have marked the rirst
tunning of the Eldridge cup race, for
which five clubs had entered teams of
ten men each. M. C. Rambo, the ener
getic <Jiairman of the California Asso
ciated JjCyclists* racing committee had,
with his associates, made all the neces
sary preparations for the event.
The rain yesterday morning Interfered
Â¦with what gave promise of being one of
the mcst sensational bicycle races held
in years on the San Leandro triangle.
The report from California is to the
effect that the Baldwin stable has been
backing the colt in the future books with
a vengeance. James O'Leary confirms
the report, and says he has laid $22,500
against $1500 on the chances of Cruzados
during the past week.
Cruzados is quoted at odds of 12 to 1 in
O'Leary's winter book, being on even
terms with McChesney and Runnells. Abe
Frank is still at 7 to 1, and it is reported
$1000 has been wagered on his chances at
these odds during the past week. The
"bunch" of money is supposed to have
come from Memphis, but George C. Ben
nett, owner of the colt, (has not been men
tioned in connection with the wagering.
Since Abe Frank's race in the Tennessee
Derby there has been less enthusiasm
about him. It is conceded that Bennett's
colt does not necessarily hold a mortgage
on the blue ribbon event.
CHICAGO. April 20.â There is evidently
something doing in California.' Cruzados,
according, to reports, has been backed for
the American Derby as if "Lucky" Bald
win's horse had already swept under the
wire a winner.

.The Liberal Democratic party will hold
a State convention in Cooper Union on
June 7, at which a. full State ticket will
be nominated. This announcement means
that there will be two Democratic candi
dates for Governor In the field next No
vember and that the Bryanites' fight
against Hill is to be carried to the Dolls.
Norman E. Mack, New York member
of the Democratic National Committee,
has been In the West conferring with tha
Nebraska leader. .
Mr. Bryan recently, suggested the nom
ination of Mr. Mack for Governor. The
announcement that the Bryanites would
run an independent campaign in this
State is the first step toward carrying out
Mr. Bryan's ideas about the New York
situation.
This movement is believed by politicians
to be a part of Mr. Bryan's general plan
to eliminate Hill as a candidate for the
Presidential nomination in 1904. Now that
the various Democratic factions have
agreed on Hill 'for leader in the coming
campaign, his prominence in the event
of success at the polls is giving the Bry
anites great concern.
They calculate that Hill can be headed
off aa a Presidential possibility by tha
nomination of a third ticket this fall and
the consequent defeat of the regular Dem
ocratic candidate for Governor.

It is a remarkable sight, a spot where
the. most blase- globe trotter stands in
mute wonder. : With the exception of: a
single cottonwood ttrunk,.the trees are of
an extinct coniferous species and lie upon
the ground. The section or ends of the
logs show brilliant reds and yellows ;and
dull blues. Thebark is not brilliant, but
dull, and wonderfully 1 "preserved. Some
trees show even the knots to perfection."
Some of the petrified^ logs are fiur feet
in diameter and from ten to twelve feet
long. -
Here and there are heaps of chips from
the petrified trees and the beauty of color
is bewildering. There are thousands or
bushels of chips that are red moss agate
and may be beautifully^ polished. There
are many times more chips of amethyst,
gray topaz and varl-hued agates, show-
Ing the grain of the. trees as they grow
millions of years ago. One may obtain
cross sections of logs, showing in com
plete detail the annual ring marks and
separation of . the bark' from the trees.
The action of heat and .cold has broken
most of the fossils into sections from two
to twenty feet long, and; some, of . them
must have been immense trees. .

We have existing only four small vessels that
might benefit by the passage of this bill, ana
they are on the Pacific. While in the coast
wise trade, in which they are now engaged, the
provisions of the bill would not apply to them.
The consolidation will result in better trans
atlantic' service, more uniform rates, a Just
distribution of traffic over all American and
Canadian seaports, increased lines on the Pa
cific and services to South America as tnffle
may Justify. Having lines between Great
Britain and Australia and New Zealand and in
timate connection with the far East, American
manufacturers will be able to distribute their
products on through bills of lading and avoid
the expense of transshipments which thev now
incur. The products of the farm will be shlppj<j
from the seaport most coni-enient to the point
of production. To what extent these new serv
ices will be conducted by steamships built in
this country and sailed under the American
flag depends upon Congress.
The negotiations have covered a period of
many years, and I was Interested In the sub
ject as far back as 1SS4. The passage of the
chip subsidy bill would have one effect so far
as the new enterprise Is concerned. It would
cnatk- us to sail ships now building and here
after built under the American flag on an
equal footing with the ships of other coun
tries. The published statements that the ship
subsidy bill would enable us to sail our for
eign vessels under the Stars and Stripes are
lnccrrect, as the bill specifies that only Amer
ican built ships can benefit by Its provisions,
and furthermore, such a course if possible, is
contrary to the whole scheme.
The object of the company is to try to give
better transatlantic service at a decreased
cost. Heretofore the trade has been extrava
gantly conducted and we propose to operate
more intelligently in the future. We expect in
time to inaugurate a system of dally depart
ures from New York, an innovation that Is a.
real necessity.
The capitalization of the consolidated com
panies will be in the neighborhood of $200,
uOO.OOO. Workinr capital, of course, will be
provided, and the profits and reserve fond
should enable us to build the necessary addi
tions to our fleets. While control of the com
pany will be held in this country It will be a
strictly international organization, preserving
the various companies Included in the consoli
dation, respecting their national and local sur
roundlrcf. - , .
PHILADELPHIA, April 2O.-Clement A.
Griscom, president of the International
Navigation Company, one of the five
transatlantic steamship companies which
have been merged under the direction of
J. P. Morgan, to-day said he was unable
to speak definitely regarding the financial
plan, as that was a matter for the con
sideration of Morgan and his partners,
which will perhaps be decided upon
shortly. â¢
In any event, President Griscom said,
the consolidated companies would prob
ably be in operation under the new con
ditions within a few months. So far as
the negotiations regarding the merger are
concerned, they have been completed.
Agreements for a controlling Interest in
each of the various lines have been se
cured and all that now remains to be
accomplished is the organization of the
parent company. It is possible that the
International Navigation Company will
be made the parent company. The ques
tion now under consideration is the de
sirability of this plan as against the or
ganization of a new company to control
the operations of the combined lines.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua, April 20. â The
severe explosion that occurred here on
the night of April 16 blew to fragments a
large two-story barrack near the lake
front and in the center of the city. "Be
tween 100 and 200 officers and soldiers. are
reported. to have been killed and many
soldiers and other persons are reported
injured. A large number of houses near
the barrack, Including the National Ho
tel, the Central Â¦ telegraph station and
the National Palace, were damaged or
wrecked. ... ,â¢ '
President Zelaya was absent at Mayasa
at the time of the explosion, but he hur
riedly returned to Managua on horseback.
He has published a statement in which
he attributes the disaster to the work of
conspirators. He says that tons of dyna
mite and a large quantity of powder were
stored in the barracks. The actual causes
which led to the explosion have not yet
been determined.- \ .' ',
After the first explosion the police noti
fied the terrified people to temporarily
leave the city, as it was believed the
burning building still contained dynamite.
Large .numbers fled to the suburbs. The
first explosion was followed by several
minor detonations, supposed to have been
caused "by â¢ the explosion of packages of
gunpowder. . . .
The people | who fled the city at the
time of the explosions were returning to
day.. The fragments of those of the dead
who , were not blown . to atoms j were
buried.
SUNDAY LAWS
NOT ENFORCED
To-day the dead are lying in the M&ison
aes Proletaires. which has been converted
Â¦Into a mortuary chapel by drapings, can
yi'es and crucifixes.
| Crowds of workmen filed through the
building during the day.
In the meantime the other band of riot
ers had a similar but less tragic experi
ence. In collision between the rioters and
the guards, a drummer of the latter broke
from the ranks and joined the mob, shout-
Ing to them to have no fear, as the guards
were only supplied with blank cartridges.
Yelling, the mob rushed on. It was met
by a valley from the guards. Two of the
rioters were killed and many were
wounded.
The papers here contain vivid descrip
tions of the riots which occurred at Lou
vuinc, near here, last Friday.
The mob, which was returning from the
v^vrtion alter meeting the Socialist Depu
tes from Brussels, divided into two
L>~n<3s, one making tor the residence of
the president of the Chamber, M. Schol
laeit, and the other for that of the Min
ister of the Interior, M. de Troose. The
ttret mentioned mob was led by a man of
Kieantic stature, nourishing a butcher
Unite. Alter breaking through the ranks
of one squad of civic guard the mob
found its way blocked in a. narrow lane
Djr another squad of the same organiza
tion. An officer of the guard ran forward
und called upon the mob to halt, shout
ing that otherwise he would order his men
to fire a volley on them. The rioters dis
regarded this order. The officer was about
to give the command to fire when the
gigantic leader of the rioters leaped for
ward and seized the officer's throat with
his big hands. He pinned him against a
wall and leveled a pistol at his head.
Another officer yelled the order to fire and
plunged a bayonet into the giant's breast.
I he foremost of the rioters grasped the
bayonets of the guards' leveled rifles in
their bare hands. The volley rang out
and in the narrow lane the mob was rid
dled with bullets. Several were killed.
The remainder of the rioters broke and
fled.
The anticipated announcement by the
crowd oÂ£ the dissolution has not yet been
made.

deavor to .stick to coffee.
A lady says in part of a long letter:
'The only way I Â«ould get any sleep at

Jn the yard until I got so tired I wouid
fall asleep aa coon as I touched the bed,
but after a little 1 would commence roll-

one place for any length or time.
"1 became despondent and unhappy.
My stomach was all out of order and my
nerves, absolutely broken down. One
day a lady friend when calling said,' 'My
de&r, I believe It is coffee that makes you
bo sick and nervous.' I replied, 'I don't
believe coffee hurts anyone. My phy-
sician knows that I use coffee and be has
never eald anything about its being hurt-
ful/ She replied, 'I can't help that;
they did not tell me either, but I "found
cut myself when I quit coffee end began
to use Portura that I got well.'
"I will never forget that October even-
Ing, three years ago, when I had my first

\ Weather. Report.
The early part of the coming, week in
the House will be devoted to routine busi
ness, with a prospect that some important
general legislation may be taken up dur
ing the latter part of the week, i To-mor
row will be devoted to District of Colum
bia business, Tuesday to war claims and
Wednesday to the oleomargarine bill,
which -\v(ks amended by the Senate. Dur
ing the remaining days of the week it is
practically settled that the anti-anarchist
bill of Chairman Ray of the Judiciary
Committee will be considered. -The meas
ure Is much more stringent than the anar
chist bill passed by the Senate. Plans are
ron foot for considering the omnibus pub
lic building bill also during the latter days
of the week. The measure has not yet
been reported from the House Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds, but it
probably, will be completed early next
week, so that It may be taken up later in
the week. Beyond this no exact pro
gramme has been arranged. Two appro
priation bills, the agricultural and naval
bills, are about ready and may be brought
in at any time, and' the Military Academy
appropriation bill is on the calendar.
It is now understood that Senator Raw
lins. senior Democratic member of the
Senate Committee on the Philippines, will
lead off in the speechmakingr in opposition
to the Philippine bill, to be followed by
other members of the- committee and
other Democratic Senators. The opinion
is expressed chat the bill will be before
the Senate for at least three weeks.
WASHINGTON, April 20.â The Senate
will begin the week by taking up the river
and harbor appropriation bill to-morrow,
and when that' matter is disposed of will
resume of the Philippine
Government bill. It is riot expected that
much time will be required to set the
river and. harbor bill through the Senate,
as it is generally approved by' Senators.
Chairman 'Frye, chairman of the Commit
tee ort Commerce, who has charge of the
bill, f. to-day expessed the opinion .''that
there would be no debate on the bill and
that it would pass as soon as it could be
read.

The opening of the Neill season to-night
at the California Theater will be quite an
important event in theatrical circles. The
popular company returns without a break
in Its personnel, and has taken unto itself
a few new 'members" since Its last year's
season. Their/ performances have won
for them an enviable reputation here, and
they stand for clean and conscientious
work, with now and again v Â«.omething very
much- above the average dramatic enter
tainment. â¢ X "
The opening bill will be "Captain Lettar

interest : to insure large. housesMor its
revival. Mr. Neill has the title rolevaud
is quite fascinating as the gallant Irish
man. Edythe Chapman, still the leading

Friday, and at the Saturday matinee;
"Tom Pinch" dramatized for Mr. Wil
lard from "Martin Chuzzlewit," on Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday evenings;
and on Saturday night "The Professor's
Love Story." The famous English actor
is said to be particularly well suited in
the role of David Garrick, and as Dick
ens' quaint hero should be even more hap
pily cast. The Tom Pinch ' character,
with its gentle humility, sweetness and
true* manliness, is said to be among the
best work that Mr. Willard has done, and
the play will- doubtless be a very attract
ive bill. Next week come Maxine Elliott
and Nat, Goodwin in "When We Were
Twenty-one."
. The j bill at , the * Orpheum for this week
is one of the best that has been offered
at the . popular vaudeville house yfor
months. Every feature from the opening
of the programme to the conclusion is ex
ceptionally entertaining. The Pony Bal
let, a decided Eastern novelty composed
of -eight pretty damsels, who are airy in
manner and light of foot, is one of the
pleasing features of the show. " The Three
iVortons, father, mother and daughter, are
perhaps the best ail around dancing, mus
ical and off-hand fun makers that have
appeared at the Orpheum in some time.
At the opening of their sketch the elder
Nortons shine as a quaint old Irish cou

present a tinale that is particularly pleas
ing. .
Milton and Dolly Nobles, who have been
popular in this city for the last ten years,
are on the bill with a brand new one-act
comedy entitled ."Why Walker Reform

ability of the versatile couple full swing.
Knight Brothers, singing and talking
comedians, amuse with their original

ORPHEUM'S BILL
GOOD AS USUAL
TO CELEBRATE
THE "PASSOVER"
Solemn Jewish Festival
. to Commence This
Evening.
Special Services Are to Be
Held in All the'Syna
gogues.
This evening the solemn festival of the
Passover will be celebrated | by the He
brew citizens of the city. Special services
will be held in all the synagogues.
"Passach," or "The Feast of Unleavened
Bread," commemorates the exodus of the
Jews from Egypt under the leadership of
Moses, who. according to tradition, deliv
ered the Jews from the bondage under
which they had served under theÂ»Pha
roahs.
The festival lasts for seven days and Is
rigidly kept by orthodox Hebrews. Those
of the faith who cling to the traditions of
the race, abstain from all food for twen
ty-four hours preceding the commence
ment of the festival. The "sedar," or
"passover supper," is partaken of this
evening in the homes of all Jews, and the
ceremony includes the drinking of four
cups of wine, the eating of bitter herbs,
dipped in a sweet sauce, 1 called "haroseth"
and the singing of songs of praise known
as the "hallel."
"Matzos," or "unleavened bread, is
used during the Passover festival, and is
commemorative of the tradition that when
the Jews departed f rom < Egypt they had
no time to leaven the dough already In
the troughs.
The delivers' from Egyptian bondage is
supposed to have taken place 1200 years
before the birth of Christ, the present
year of the Jewish calendar being 5662.
The services in the synagogues this
evening will be devotional and to-morrow
morning sermons will be delivered to the
congregations by all the rabbis.
Among the strictly orthodox Jews, spe
cial household utensils are used during the
Passover week, rt being against the tenets
to make use of any articles that may have
touched leavened bread during the rest
of the year. .
The presentation of the harvest sheaf is
a feature of the festival and denotes the
thankful recognition of God's goodness in
the harvest season, while the sacrifice of
the "paschal lamb" commemorates the of
fering of the first of the flocks In similar
thankfulness.
Rabbi Isidor Meyers will preach to
morrow morning at the Bush-street syn
agogue, his subject being "The Survival
of the Fittest." " '
Rabbi Voorsanger will deliver a sermon
to-morrow morning at Temple Emanu-El,
his text being "From Generation to Gen
eration." Â¦ 'â¢- â¢:â¢Â¦ '

IN AWFUL FORM
Aged Italian Woman Is
Burned to a Cinder
at Her Home.

Cut off from escape by a roaring fur
nace raging between two frame buildings
In the rear of a Broadway restaurant,
Mrs. Dana Obin, an aged Italian woman,
Â¦was burned to a cinder last night. One
brave lad, George Barham by name, stag
gered through the blinding smoke, and
managed to reach the sizzling body on
the porch, where it lay. while life was
still left In it. He grasped the woman by
tne arms, but the baked flesh tore away
in his hanus. He was blistered and half
suffocated with the blinding smoke, and
was reluctantly forced back down the
narrow stairway without rescuing the
doomed woman. Others tried to pass the
wall of flame and reach the writhing mass
which could be seen occasionally through
the blaze, but their efforts were in vain.
Policeman George Brown, who, with rare
good judgment, had turned in a second
alarm when the fire first broke out. made
a. determined effort to pass the flames and
reach the woman, but retired with burn
ed hands and smoke-tilled lungs. For
nearly an hour the body lay on the nar
row porch, almost under the feet of the
firemen, but long before it was removed
all signs of life had ceased.
Finally a blanket was secured and the
charred mass was taken to a little room
in the adjoining building, where it lay
until removed by the Morgue officials. It
was burned to an unrecognizable state.
The dead woman was 60 years of age and
the wife of a tamale peddler at the cor
ner of Sixth and Market streets. She
lived in a room in the rear of the Buono
Gusto restaurant, the only exits from
which were the stairways through the
restaurant building, both of which were
cut off by flames. Her husband did not
know of her death for several hours
after, end the grief of the old fellow as
he gazed at the blackened corpse at the
Morgue was pitiful.
The fire started in the kitchen of the
Buono Gusto restaurant, at 524 Broadway,
from a pan of burning grease, and speed
ily climbed up in the space between the
restaurant and the frame shack in the
rear, wnere Mrs. Obin lived. In the same
building was Mrs. Margaret Lane, but
her room was near the head of the stair
way and she managed to escape with the
assistance of some of the waiters in the
restaurant.
George Barham. the fifteen-rear-old
hero, who made such a. gallant effort to
rescue Mrs. Obin. was one of the first' to
reach the fire. He dashed up the stair
way and onto the blazing porch and man
aged to reach the body.
"When I first saw her." he said, "one of
her arms was rising and falling, and she
â¢was evidently making an effort to gain
her feet. Her clothing had all been
burned off and her flesh blackened by the
flames. 1 caught her by one arm, but the
hot flesh burned my hands and tore away
when I pulled. Then her hair caught fire,
and I was forced to go back down stairs
Â¦without her."
The brave little fellow once before dis
tinguished himself, about two years ago,
by stopping a runaway horse and saving
a. woman and child from probable injury.
He lives at Broadway and Vallejo street.
The damage by fire amounts to $3030,
partially covered by insurance. The
Buono Gusto restaurant suffered damage
to the extent of 51000. and tne Toscano Ho
tel, next door, was injured by fire and
Â¦wrater to an equal extent. The shacks in
the rear were gutted by the flames and
the loss on them will amount, to 51000. â '-j
