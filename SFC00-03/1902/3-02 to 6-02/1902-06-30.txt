For about a month he has been in San

April 3, 1901, McAllister, was mustered lout
of. the service and he produced his dis
charge papers" to show he is a Philippine
veteran.
The case is a peculiar one. McAllister,
who. is 30 years of age, comes from
Wheatland, 111. He enlisted in the army
during the Spanish- American war and
was sent to . the . Philippines in Company
K, Thirtieth United States Infantry. The
man claims to have seen much hard serv
ice and finally became hardened and pos
sessed of an insane desire to kill a Fili
pino single-handed. This preyed upon his
mind and he watched every -. chance to
satiate his wish for murder.
SAN JOSE, . June 29.â With a desire to

Minister Squlers' report on the arrest of
'Amadeo Raves and Isabelle Lacavallrie,
the alleged elopers, on board a Ward line
eteamship in Havana harbor, probably
will arrive in a day or two, and the State
Department will then decide what action
to take, if, indeed, any . action by this
Government is necessary. While the
charge preferred against Raves by the
father of Senorita Lacavallrie was one of
embezzlement, the young lovers declare
the disgrace of arrest was brought upon
them simply because they ran away from
home to marry. The fair senorita's
father, a wealthy citizen of the City of
Mexico, where for some time Raves has
resided, cabled to the Mexican Consul in
Havana to cause the arrest of the elopers.
They were taken from the Ward liner de
epite the" protest of the captain, who ap
pealed to Minister Squiers to interfere.
The American representative declined to
assume any responsibility and Senor Zal

Judge Â¦ McMillan went to New Mexico
more than three years ago for the benefit
of his health. Prior to that time he had
served in the New York Senate and had
been an attorney for the New York Cen
tral Railroad. He had been in New Mex
co about a year when he became a candi
date for appointment to the Supreme
bench.' There was considerable opposition
to him on the ground that he was a "car
petbagger,", but he was appointed by
President McKinley. He is a man of pro
nounced legal ability, and has conducted
his court in a manner satisfactory to
most of the people in New. Mexico.
JURIST OF ABILITY.
Judge McMillan heard several weeks
ago .that : charges were to be preferred
against him , by certain persons in New
Mexico, and he at once started for Wash
ington. Since arriving here he has ascer
tained the nature of the charges. He has
as yet made no formal answer, but prob
ably will do so this week. It is under
stood that Judge 'McMillan explains one
of tho points at issue by stating that the
way the charges . arose concerning his
traveling in company*with a woman over
his circuit was that a certain woman vis
ited him when he was holding court at
Lincoln, N.M., for the purpose of learn
ing whether or not he could assist her in
getting transportation for her children to
come to New Mexico. This, Judge Mc-
Millan said, was the only time he saw
thu woman while on his â¢ circuit. The
persons who have filed the charges, he
says, are relatives of men whom he, dis
charged from a jury for incompetence
and unreliability. .
WOMAN IN THE CASE.
The charges are of a serious nature and
directed at Judge McMillan's morality.
They have been filed*, together with nu
merous affidavits, within the : ; last few
weeks by persons whom Judge McMillan

Wrapped In flames from blazing kero
sene and with . her arms outstretched,
Mrs.' Ignacio Gerardi, an aged woman,
mother of twelve children, appeared be
fore members of her family and friends
late yesterday afternoon. She emerged
from a small closet and paused on the
threshold of a door leading into the din
ing-room, where husband, sons, daughters 1
and friends were assembled. , Her expla
nation of her tragic plight was simple
and given before the startled spectators
could make a move to her relief. " .
"The flames! The flames !** she shrieked.
"Now they have me. I have given my
self to them. They have been, calling mm
for three months."
' The fire, writhing upward, then stifled
her. She stumbled forward and sank to
the floor. Rescuers came quickly. First
among them was Officer James O'Connor.
He smothered the blaze, then tore thb
smoldering clothing from the unfortunate
woman's body and sent her to the hos
pital. Respite from horrible agony cams
soon in death, and the blackened corpse
was removed to the Morgue.
HER SONS SAIL NORTH.
The shocking story' of Mrs. . Gerardi 1 â¢
suicide was soon told throughout the"
Italian colony. She had become demented
from worry over the . absence Â¦ of ; three
sons," who are: in Alaska.-^Recently lier
dementia brought strange hallucinations.
She . imagined a reunlon ; ,wifh her son3
could be accomplished â¢' throush ' lite asczt
cy of fire. She told her fancies to her
neighbors, and her threats to burn her
self to death have been frequent. But
those to whom she confided them, never
dreamed of their awful consummation.
Yesterday she quietly left a table at
which her family had assembled and en
tered a closet. She drenched her gar
ments with kerosene and applied a
match. Then she appeared to them for
the last time in life, wrapped in flames,
her arms outstretched, a living cross of
fire.
Mrs. Gerardi was 50 years of ago and
resided with her husband, a crab fisher
man, at 104 Vandewater street, where the
tragedy occurred. Her eldest daughter.
Mrs. Maria Glllotti, Is about 21 years of
age. There are eleven other children,
ranging in age from 2 to 19 years. Early
In the spring three of her eldest sons
went to Alaska in company with- their
brother-in-law, Gillottl. Since no word
has been received from them. Neighbors
told the mother of the perils of the frozen
north and caused what had only been
suspense to grow to an all-consuming
fear. Day after day she waited for word,
but none came. Then she began to act
strangely, and no one could pacify her.
As time passed she talked of her boys,
and then of fire. She said she bad seen
flames and that they beckoned her on
ward. Visions of flames became more
frequent. Finally she said they haunted
her and that she must go.
MAKES MANY THREATS.
On occasions when she became morose
and said she would burn herself to death
her auditors tried to soothe her fears,
but never guessed the Import of her
words. Even her daughter and her hus
band failed to heed her threats.
Yesterday afternoon the dinner table
bad been cleared of a simple repast and
her husband and seven of her children.
Including Mrs. Gillottl, assembled for a
game of cards. Some other occupants of
the house came in and before long the
party numbered nearly thirty. There
were present little children, mothers with
babes in their arms, men and youths. The
merriment began* and no one saw the de
mented mother slip from the room. Intent
on her awful purpose. Soon she emerged
in flames.
Efforts to extinguish the flames were
futile until the arrival of Policeman
O'Connor. Mrs. Gillottl fought desperate
ly to save her mother, and her hands
were so badly burned that she also went
to the hospital. O'Connor after smother.
Ing the fire carried the woman to the
sidewalk. There he tore her garments
from her and covered her body, which
was frightfully burned from head to foot,
with oil, and wrapping her In a blanket
sent her to the Harbor Hospital. Dr.
Armistead treated her, but she died in a
short time. " .

The naval officials generally have
shown a good deal of discretion and for
bearance in keeping these facts quiet.
Here was a plan of Congress to show
how much better outsiders could do than
the naval constructors' had done. The
builders paid the best men in. the profes
sion to draw designs. Some of the de
elgns were bought in- Europe. Yet" in
nearly every case the boats have proved
disappointing. In time Â¦ these boats will
be replaced with better ones and the old
ones will be sent to the junk heap. They
cost from $160,000 , to $250,000 apiece and
they will be worn out probably feefpre the
next naval war comes along.
It is not the fault of the department that
the boats have shown up so badly, but the
department is the only one to blame for
their acceptance. Secretary Long was
told by Congress to give the contractors
a chance to draw their own plans, for
there was an idea in Congress at that time
that the outsiders could do better than
the regular naval designers and construc
tors; so the bidders put in their own plan3
and did all the work. The department had
nothing to do but carry out the wishes of
Congress.
As for the builders, most of them have
lost money on their- contracts, because,
after building the boats, they have had
to put out thousands of dollars on alter
ations, repairs, new designs for machin
ery, etc. i '
Before Secretary Long left the depart
ment many of the builders went to him.
and admitted the fact that they could not
meet -their speed contracts and that they
had gone into this business ignorantly.
Thoy wanted the Secretary to get Con
gress to make up their losses. Secretary
Long had the claims investigated, so that
they were reduced to the bare statement
of the money actually paid out, not
counting the cost of plants or anything
like that, and the facts will be put before
Congress next winter. But Secretary"
Long did not and Secretary Moody will
not promise any action by the depart
ment, except as Congress itself shall di
rect. . â¢ .
More startling, however, is the an
nouncement that out of the twenty-eight
torpedo-boats and torpedo-boat destroy
ers launched during the past two yeara
only threeâ and those three built in Bath,
Me.â have met the Government, require
ments for speed, varying in .the several
cases from twenty-eight to thirty knots
an hour. The greater part of these boats
successfully passed the builders' test, but
were unable to meet the requirements of
the department. They have been, with the
exception of the -Boston-built boats, ac
cepted by the department, Â¦ and nothing
has been said of their failure to show the
speed contracted for.
The fact that the four Boston-built tor
pedo-boats and torpedo-boat destroyers
have not been accepted by the Govern
ment has not beea made public, although
rumors to that effect have been circulated
in naval circles. Inquiry by The Call cor
respondent confirms these rumors.
BOSTON, June 29.â Through Congres
sional interference with the affairs of
the Navy Department the department
itself now faces a grave condition, ani
the Government is practically a loser of
from $4,&00,000 to $7,000,000. These sums
represent the amounts paid for torpedo-'
boats and torpedo-boat destroyers.

Captain Little ia the owner of the boat.
Captain Little devoted most of his ef

He did not see the crew after leaving the

took to a raft they must have perished,
because no small craft could live in the

In order to find a precedent for the ses
sion to-day the House managers went
back to 1811. when the House held a ses
sion on March 2 because of the pressure
of public business two days before the
flnal adjournment, March 4.
Cannon, in his eulogy of Mr. Cummings
to-day, concluded his remarks as follows:
Frequently in times past the House has
met on Sunday and especially at the close
of a short session, but such sessions al
ways have been continuations of the leg
islative day of Saturday and the journal
on Monday showed no session on Sunday.
In this case, however, the Journal of to
day will be that of a regular legislative
day.
Although services have been held in the
House on Sunday on previous occasions,
notably the death of Henry Winter Da
vis, this was the first time in ninety-one
>ears when Sunday was made a legisla
tive day and the House met with a
Speaker, clerks and all the paraphernalia
that accompany the actual transaction of
legislative business.
REGULAB LEGISLATIVE DAY.
The widows and families of the de
ceased occupied the Speaker's pew in the
gallery and delegations from Typograph
ical Linion No. 6 of New York, the Letter
Carriers' Association and' the New York
Illots' associations came here to honor
Mr. Cummings' memory. The public gal
leries were filled. The eulogies were ex
ceedingly impressive,* especially that de
iivered by Cannon of Illinois, the veteran
chairman of the Appropriations Commit

the manly, honest character of Mr. Cum
mings.
WASHINGTON, June 29.â The House of
Representatives had a session to-day to
p&y tribute to the memory of the late
Representative Amos Cummings of New
York and the late Representative J. Otey
of Virginia. By special direction of Sec
retary Moody the marine band was in
attendance in the lobby in the rear of
the hall and rendered an appropriate mu

Owing to some friction between the In
dian and the Colonial offices, there will be
two separate reviews of the Horse Guards

Secretary of State: Mrs. Chamberlain and
some cf the colonial premiers now in
London, were guests of the Honorable So
ciety of Grays Inn at luncheon to-day and
emended a service of Intercession for the
recovery of the King at the quaint little
chapel of the society.
Several postponed functions are being
arranged. Lord and Lady Lansdowne an

Buckingham Palace has worn a gayer
appearance to-day than for a week past,
and the constant coming . and going of
royalty and streams, of carriages bore
testimony to the increased confidence
that the King would recover. In the aft
ernoon the Prince and Princess of Wales
paid a long visit to Buckingham Palace.
This evening the Queen and the royal
ladies dined in sight of the public through
the windows in front of the palace, many
thousands of persons being gathered in
the space before the building.
The King was again successfully trans
ferred from his bed to a movable couch.
GAYETY AT BUCKINGHAM.
Sir Francis Knollys, the King's private
secretary; Sir Dighton. McNaghten-Pro

tra equerry to the King, and almost the
entire royal household attended the eer
Â»-ices in Marlborough House chapel. The
Queen, who had not previously left the
precincts cf Buckingham Palace since the
King was stricken, received a sympa
thetic greeting. The public was delighted
with evidence of the King's continued
improvement.
Throughout the United Kingdom all re
ligious denominations made a similar in
tercession for the sovereign's recovery.
Monseigneur Merry del Val, the Papal
Envoy to the coronation of King Edward,

Bishop of Stepney and Right Rev. Cosmo
Gordon Lang, and at its conclusion the
whole audience sang "God Save the

PBAYEES FOE THE KING.'
This bulletin was not expected until 10
o'clock, consequently the few persons
who were passing in the neighborhood of
the palace were the only ones attracted
to the announcement. When the footmen
h&d posted the notice, however, the
crowds soon increased, early churchgoers
â¢topping to read the latest news and pass
ing on with expressions of thankfulness.
A bulletin posted at the palace at 4
o'clock this alternoon said the King's
progress was in every way satisfactory
and that the local discomfort had de
creased. The physicians announced at
twenty minutes to 10 o'clock to-night that
the royal patient's condition was entirely

"That San Pedro criminal libel case i3
being talked of all over the State, and
the only sentiment I have heard express
ed is that Gage, in taking the case to San
Pedro, sought to vent personal spitÂ© in
stead of to secure justice. The people
cannot understand why he took the case
to a point remote from San Francisco.*
where it might have been speedily^ tr!tu
and decided. By those with whom n con
versed his action in taking the case to
San Pedro ia regarded as an effort to play
politics and not to secure aÂ» vindication.
He has not helped himself by this action.
"In Sacramento Flint will divide the
delegation with Gage. In spite of. the fact
that Gage ia claiming the entire Sacra
mento delegation I know that he will get
only about half of It. Four-fifths of the
delegates thus far elected have been in
structed fcr Flint and others will receive
similar instructions. We will go to the

ty with at .least 40 per cent of the dele

LOS ANGELES. June 29.â Former Stata
Senator Robert N. Bulla returned to-day
from Yosemite Valley, where he ha3 been
with Senator Thomas Flint Jr. and Sen
ator Belshaw.. He has been in the cen
tral portion of the State for several
weeks, making a study of the political
situation with reference to the guberna
torial contest. He has been prominently
identified with the candidacy of Senator
Flint for Governor ever since it was an
nounced. Aaked what hi3 views of tho
situation were he said to-night:
"I am surprised at the unanimity or
sentiment in the central portion of tha
State, the San Joaquin Valley and north
of it, against the renomination and re
election of Gage. The Gage forces had
been claiming that part of the State, and
I went into it to ascertain what basis
existed for their claims. I was agree&bly
surprised at the result. ?
"I did not go only to anti-Gage men
but among men in politics whom I have
known for years, and asked them confi
dentially as to the situation. Almost in
variably I received replies that indicated
an almost universal sentiment against
Gage, or not so much against Gage per
sonally as against the boss rule and ma
chine domination which has so marke-i
his administration.
"At Fresno I learned of two Govern
ment employes, one of them a deputy un
der Revenue Collector Lynch and another
a Deputy United States Marshal, who
made a tour through several counties on
business and incidentally asked those
about them what they thought of Gage.
They reported that out of twenty-six in
fluential citizens to whom the inquiry was
put twenty-five stated that they hoped
Gage would not be renominated and fur
ther asserted that if ne is renominated
they would not vote for him. _ .

Former State Senator Balla
Percy F. Miel Had many warm friends
here. His former wife and two children
reside with Mrs. Miel's father, ex -Judge
Sullivan of Alameda. A recent decision
of the court here In some mining litigation
gave the deceased $6000. Only a* part of
this had been received by him, and just
how much remains for the widow and
children is not known.
In response to a telegram sent to the
brother this morning, the Rev. Mr. Miel
telegraphed to have the body embalmed
and sent at once to the north. It will be
shipped to-morrow at noon.
Miel had lived in Los Angeles about four
years,- coming here from San ' Francisco.
His father, a very old man, is a retired
clergyman of the Episcopal church and
lives In Philadelphia. An elder brother,
also connected with the same organiza
tion, has for several years been rector of a
leading church in San Francisco. Some
years ago, while in spiritual charge o,f a
Sausallto flock, he was elected and served
through one session as chaplain of the
State Senate.
Â¦ Now it is discovered that the man's real
name was Percy F. Miel, and the reason
for his false registration is' more or less
of a mystery to his friends here.
â¢In the afternoon he had chartered a
.boat for a row. They had been paddling
about the bay for some time, when sud
denly he fell backward into the water
and there floated, face down and some
little distance beneath the surface, until
brought up a few minutes later by th*j
boatmen who came at once to the rescue
on hearing the woman's cries. All ef
forts at resuscitation proved unavailing
and the death was apparently not caused
by drowning. The. woman who passed as
his wife stated that he was subject to
epileptic fits, and that one of these was
probably what caused his death.

We have been known in the . past to
consider the~color scheme! in selecting our
summer wardrobe, but somebody seems
to have gone mad this season. The milli
ner sent forth the flat for the bluest and
greenest of veils, and we obey her dic
tates blindly, although our better -sense
tells us the combination Is unpardonable
and the artists rail at the glaring anrt
inharmonious effects. Still we call ours a
free country. - . - .
Our milliners may know why we have
both blue and green chiffon loaded upon
our summer hats. I do not. :
The church was beautifully decorated.
Their Imperial Highnesses Comte and
Ccraptesse d'Eu and their suite, including
the Baron and Baronne de Muritiba, were
among the first to arrive.
A pretty wedding took place far across
the sea in Paris at high noon on June 11
last. Prominent people from many coun
tries were present when Dr. Charles J.
Koenig, an American physician, and
Mile. Luiza de Araujo were united ' in
marriage. The bride's family is very well
known in Brazil, where both her grand
fathers successively occupied the post of
Regent during the minority of Dom Pe
dro. Mile, de Araujo is a charming young
lady and moves in the best French soci
ety. Dr. Koenig, who has resided for
some years past in Paris, is the son of
Anton Koenig, so well known in the
United States.
Little Lord Faunticroy is with us again.
This time we have no paper imitation,
but the one living originaiâ the genuine
articleâ in the personage of Vivian Bur
nett, who has come to this city for a
brief stay. If Mrs. Frances Hodgson
Burnett were to write a sequel to that
charming story, with her son as the hero,
would. she still go into raptures over his
curls or come down to plain facts and
say that he is even getting bald? How
would we accept the change? In private
life we may fall in love with
men whose lack of hair seems their one
limitation; in fact, we almost go out of
our way to appreciate their good points,
but in book loreâ where ideals scarcely
vary a hair's breadth from perfectionâ
never! However, Mr. Burnett is doubly
interesting out of the book, even though
he bears not tha faintest resemblance to
the erstwhile Little Lord Fauntieroy.
This lord of to-day is exceptionally
clever, having inherited the literary
tastes of his gifted mother. Mr. Burnett
is being much entertained in San Fran
cisco's littie world of letters, where he is
adding many strong friends and admirers
to his coterie in the East. Mr. Burnett is
associate editor of McClure's Magazine.
ADMIRING attention is attracted
to Mrs. Josephine Morris tie
Greayer, so faithfully has she
worked since her brother's
death to establish a reading
room for j the . adult blind at the
Free Public Library. Mrs. de Grea
yer is one of the few society
women who find time for constant active
philanthropic work. She is not satisfied
with simply subscribing. This room,
which Mrs. De Greayer has been working
these three years to establish, could have
been opened ere this with private sub
scriptions, but she had the future of the
room at heart and wanted it to be in the
library and under the control of the trus
tees for all time to come. Within ten
days it will be decided whether the base
ment room of the branch library at
Fourth and Clara streets, offered by ex-
Mayor Phelan, shall be accepted..
Mrs. de Greayer' s well-directed energy
stems to be bearing fruit. Her co-work
ers are: Mrs. W. B. Harrington, Mrs.
Ralph C. Harrison, Mrs. John F. Merrill.

KILL THE DAITDSUTP GERM.
Ct Your Hair Will Tall Out Till You
Become Bald.
Modern science has discovered that
dandruff is caused by a germ that digs
up the scalp in scales as it burrows down
to the roots of the hair, where it de-
stroys the hair's vitality, causing: falling:
hair, and, ultimately, baldness. After Pro-
fessor Unna of Hamburg, Germany, dis-
covered the dandruff germ, all efforts to
lind a remedy failed until the great lab-
oratory discovery was made which re-
sulted In N'ewbro's Herpicide. It alone
of all other hair preparations kills the
dandruff germ. Wifnout dandruff, hair
grows luxuriantly. "Destroy the cause
you remove the effect"

Conferees on Philippine Government
BUI Hold Sabbath. Session.
WASHINGTON. June 30.â The conferees
on the Philippine Government bill were
In session a large part of the Sabbath.
They met in the forenoon at Senator
Lodge's house, breaking up about i
o'clock and reassembling at 9 o'clock.
After the conference took a recess at 4
o'clock It was stated that no agreement
had been reached on the coinage and Phil
ippine legislation branches of the bill, but
that indications were favorable to an
agreement.
The night session of the conference last
ed until 1:30 this (Monday) morning. It
was not conclusive, an arrangement being
made to meet again at 10 o'clock this
morning. It was stated by the conferees
that there was little doubt that an agree
ment could be reached at the session to
day' in time to be reported to Congress
during the day, thus assuring a speed/
adjournment of Congress. The questions
still at issue relate to coinage, a Philippine
Legislature and land matters.
The session on the Philippine bill to-day
was one of the Republican conferees, the
Democrats not being united pending an
agreement by the majority.
BERLIN, June 29.â The Boerse had an
extremely, dull look last week, and many
prominent securities were misquoted for
some days because of the lack of trans
actions. All departments scored declines,
especially coal shares and Irons, and ma
chinery shares were unusually heavy.
The present tendency of speculators is
to : close | out*'engagements for the sum
mer vacation,, believing that no improve
ment Is probable In the immediate fu
ture, and that the forthcoming yearly re
ports will prove, disappointing. Another
disquieting factor is found in the latest
â¢reports of the; coal and iron industries.
The recent improvement in the coal situa
tion- seems to have been reversed. The
coal mines not belonging, to the syndicate
are increasing their competition, with tha
syndicate, h^nce the stocks of coal- of * the
latter are beginning, to accumulate at "the
mines. .The coke syndicate intends to.in
crease the restriction of the coke output
for the. month of July to 35 per cent; Re

everything, prices falling in anticipation

however, and the decline on the week
proved generally small. The demand for
money was strong, the holiday settlement
and the turn of , the half-year all falling
together. The market was forced to go
about Â£10,000,000 in debt to the bank, but
there is an expectation of easier rates dur

with Cornelius Dailey, a peddler, was

Of the appropriation bills only the gen
eral deficiency and the naval bill remain
to receive the finishing touches. There
are still some points of difference on each
of these measures between Iho two
houses, but none that cannot be har
monized whenever tho Philippine bill
shall be out of the way. Neither house
will attempt much other business. The
Senate calendar contains a number of
measures which can be discussed, and
there Is an understanding in the House
that the militia bill shall be used as a
baBe of discussion to fill in the time when
conference reports are not at hand for
consideration. There is also an under
standing that the London dock charges
bill shall be taken up under a suspension
of the rules after the adoption of the res
olution fixing the hour for adjournment.
Both houses will close the session with
exceptionally clean calendars and with
the feeling on all sides that it has been
a session of important achievements.
WASHINGTON. June j 29-Tbe exact
time when the political sression of Con
gress shall come to a close cannot ba
foretold. There is no definite information
as to when an agreement will be reached
upon the Philippine civil government bill.
However, the consensus of opinion places
the adjournment on Tuesday, or at the
latest Wednesday. This prediction in
volves the opinion [ that the Philippine
conferees will be able to conclude their
work to-morrow. That they can do this
is quite evident, in view of what has al
ready been accomplished in the way of
harmonizing the differences on that bill
and on account of the probability that
parts of the measure will be dropped in
case it should appear that no agreement
can be reached except through a pro
longed exchange of views. Neither house
is disposed to extend the.sesslon for more
than a day or two for the purpose of ob
taining an agreement on all the features
of the bill, when it is felt on all hands
that the preservation of no one feature
of the bill is necessary to its success as
a whole. It is not believed in any quarter
that either house will consume a great
deal of time in debating the conference
report when reported, but lest the debate
should run longer than -is expected the
resolution fixing the time for adjourn
ment will not be brought in until the
Philippine conference report shall have
been made to and accepted by both
houses.
Congress Will Adjourn . on Wedncs-
day at the Latest.
ITS WORK NEARLY DONE.
There have been several Investigations
during the session which have attracted
much attention. An investigation of con
ditions in the Philippines, conducted by
the Philippines Committee of the Senate,
has led to the examination of many wit
nesses high In the conduct of civil and
military affairs on the Islands. Another
Senate Inquiry has related the condition of
affairs in Cuba, especially as to sugar.
In the. House sensational charges made
in connection with the purchase of the
Danish West Indies led to an investiga
tion, which disclosed the groundless na
ture of the. charees.
Cannon also omitted contract- for fu
ture expenditure included in the omnibus
public building bill, the omnibus claims
and various other bills, aggregating a
large amount. This will carry the total
for the session, figuring in these future
amounts, almost, if not quite up to the
billion dollar mark. The appropriation
bills have contained little extra legisla
tion, being confined generally to the regu
lar needs of the various branches of the
Government. The naval bill provided for
an addition of two battleships, two ar
mored cruisers and two gunboats to the
navy, and a provision is still in contro
versy as to whether one of each class of
these ships shall be built in Government
yards.

and seven ladrones were .killed.
The board which Inquired into the
charges of cruelty, etc., brought by MÂ»-
Jor (JorneliU3 Gardener, Qdvernor of tho
province of Tnyabas. against American
officers and soldiers, being desirous of
completing its sittings, held a session to
day. The recorder objected to the admis
sion as evidence of addresses from Fili
pinos on the ground that these wero
merely buncombe and not worthy of con
sideration. He said that every regiment
was deluged with such addresses, tho
worst regiments getting the most praiae.
He said that Major Gardener should
have called the affiants when he was at
Lucena. in Tayabas Province, and tha;
the court would personally undertake to
obtain 600 affidavits regarding conditions
in Tayabas. The Filipinos, said the re
corder, are designing and past masters
in the act of affidavits and addresses and
the board had allowed the affidavits pre
sented by Major Gardener, but refused to
receive more.
Major Gardener, continuing his testi
mony, said he had considered his original
report to be strictly confidential and for
Secretary of War Root, and that since
he wrote this report and during the pres
ent investigation he had heard testimony
Â¦which he presumed to be true, which, had
he heard before, might have caused him
materially to have altered his report. Ho
said that insurgent troops might have
been temporarily disbanded and hidden
and no one except themselves cognizant
of their existence. Regarding the al
leged, cases of outrages committed by five
scidiers. Major Gardener said he did not
desire to bring these cases before the
board and that they probably were not
true, although he had made his report in
good faith, as the original affidavits
proved. I
Regarding the charge that American
soldiers in the summer and fall of 1901
had administered the water cure to na
tives. Major Gardener said that he re
ceived information to that effect from,
deputations of citizens from towns near
which the cure was said to have been
jdven.

The wreck occurred at an abandoned
station known as Culburs siding, one
mile above Cascade, in Ute Pass, and
twelve miles from Colorado Springs, a
passenger rate war .that had been In ef
fect for seven months between the rail
roads running from this city to Cripple
Creek had been called off, the rates to
go up July 1, and as a result the train
was crowded by excursionists who want
ed to take advantage of the cheap rate.
The cars that left the tracks and went
over the embankment contained 371 pas
sengers, and it is almost miraculous that
the death list was not enormous.
The second 'car on the train," a day
coach, was crushed to kindling wood, be
ing turned completely over on its end, so
that the rear end of the coach was for
ward. The third coach- plunged clear
through the second and it was in the for
ward end of this car that Knglish waa
killed. His neck was caught between
two seats and he strangled to death be
fore help could reach him. He was com
ing to Colorado Springs from Cascade to
play the organ at St. Stephen's Episco
pal Church, where he had been organist
for several years.
â¢ A relief train went to the scene from
this city and returned at 1:30, bringing
the dead and injured here. The injured
were taken to ' St. Francis Hospital,
where all are doing as well as could be
expected. The little O'Rourke girl is ex
pected to die at any time and Miss Ea
telle Lewis, a dentist of Cripple Creek, Is
in a very critical condition.
Dr. H. P. Packard of Gillett, Colo., who
was en route to this city, was the only
physician on the train. He did most he
roic and efficient service before the physi
cians and relief supplies could be sent
from this city.
The location' of the wreck was such
that there is. no delay to traffic. The
track is torn up for fully 100 yards, but
it is an old siding and the sidetrack was
not blocked. This fact facilitated the
work of clearing the wreck.'
'. Engineer J. B. Stephen and Conductor
Ben Beynon were in charge of the train.

cf general legislation not heretofore

to provide for the retirement of Its
officers; to refund the duties paid In Porto

the purpose of propogration; providing for
the, protection of game In Alaska, such
as caribou, moose, etc.; refunding: the
zzatHznt of legacy tax paid by charity,
benevolent and eleemosynary Institutions.
Another financial measure was the Hill
bill, providing for the coinage of subsid
iary coins and the retirement of the pres
ent standard silver dollar, which passed
the House but has not been acted on by
the Senate.
The Fowler bill probably was the most
Important financial measure which has

FINANCIAL MEASURES.
The bill defining the meaning of con-
Fplracy in injunction cases passed tho
House of Representatives, but has not
made much progress in the Senate. On
the other hand, the Senate passed an Im
portant measure, creating a department
of commerce, to be presided over by &

The ship subsidy bill obtained early at
tention in the Senate, but the end of the
session has come without the measure
being reported to the House. As it passed
the Senate the bill grants graded sub
sidies to steam and sailing vessels of
American build. In the House it has been
deemed desirable to let the subject go
over until the short session, when it is
expected that a subsidy bill will be
reached and urged to passage.
A bill passed by the Senate and likely
to become a law changes the marine hos

SHIPPING BILL GOES OVER.
A bill giving statehood to Arizona, New
Mexico and Oklahoma, known as the om
nibus statehood bill, passed the House
r.nd the Senate has determined to take it
up early in the next .session.
Aside from these important laws there
are a number of measures of general im
portance which have passed one or both
houses, but have not progressed to the
final stage. These Include the anti-an
archy legislation, which grew out of the
assassination of President McKinley.
Bills restricting anarchy and throwing
safe guards about the President have
passed both houses, but it has been iro
pobsible to reach an agreement in confer
ence, so that the subject goes over until
rext December.
The irrigation act is of special Impor
tance to the development of the West. It
creates an irrigation fund in the Treas
ury Department, Into which is to be paid
the proceeds of the Bales of public lands
:n the arid States. This fund in turn is
to be used in storing water and establish
ing irrigation systems,* the irrigation sec
tions to be open to homesteaders, who are
to be charged a proportionate share of
the cost of the improvement.
The Chinese exclusion law continues ex
clusion "until otherwise provided by law,"
mid also applies the exclusion "to the isl
er.d territory under the jurisdiction of
the United States."
The Philippine tariff act imposes 75 per
cent of the Dingley tariff rates on arti
cles coming from the Philippines to the
United States, and also imposes on arti
cles -entering the Philippines from the
United States the rates of duties estab
lished by the Philippine Commission.
The oleomargarine act results from sev
eral years' agitation. It places a tax of
10 cents a pound on substances colored to
imitate butter.
â¢ The repeal of the war revenue taxes re
cuced taxation $73,o50,000, and is said to
be the largest single reduction of taxa
tion ever made in this country. By this
etep the last of the taxes imposed at the
beginning of our war with Spain are
v.-iped out.
REPEAL OF WAR TAXES.
Among the other important general
laws are those repealing the war revenue
taxes; extending and making more ef
fective the Chinese exclusion laws; es
tablishing a tariff for goods to and from
the Philippines; extending the charter of
national banks for twenty years; estab
lishing a permanent census office; re
stricting tne sale of oleomargarine by
placing a high tax on imitation butter;
providing a consular and diplomatic ser
vice for Cuba; establishing an extensive
system by which the Government will aid
in the Irrigation of the arid sections of
the West.
Notable among these larger measures
is the isthmian canal bill, which consum
mates the efforts of a half-century to
link together the waters of the Atlantic
and tht Pacific. Aside from its national
and international importance, This bill
probably involves a larger sum of money
than that covering any other single un
dertaking other than war expenditures.
The Pnilippine civil government bilL is
another measure of far-reaching import
ance, extending to our remote Pacific
possessions a system of internal govern
ment, together with coinage, currency,
banking, corporation, timber and home
etead laws.
WASHINGTON, June 29.â The work of
Congress is now practically closed, so
that it is possible to sum up the record
vt what has been accomplished during
the past seven months, which constitute
the first session of the Fifty-seventh Con
gress. The session has been marked by
exceptional business activity, with many
quctions of far-reaching general interest
engaging attention. With the exception
at the Cuban reciprocity bill most of the
larger subjects of general legislation have
bc-en enacted as laws or will become such
before the session closes.

These sentences Jn which he described Bryan and

The tone committee of the party waited for the

to bite and sup together. Many came and listened
to a speech by Mr. Cleveland that will be forever
remarkable amongst the political utterances of Amer
ican statesmen. In it were no personalities, and he
made no attempt to do small or. smart politics. His
admonitions were addressed to the party which he
recreated and led. His characterizations" of that
party were quite ideal and there be many who wish
it were worthy of his ascriptions, . for then it would
be worthy of public confidence and American politics
would recover their wholesome balance.
It was interesting, that in that same connection
he accused Major Henry Watterson of being a re
organizer, a come-onter and a political cutthroat,
who would bear watching. i
THE Manhattan Club dinner in February was,
cooked and eaten in the interest of Democratic

on appetite when Mr. Bryan attacked that dinner
from soup to coffee. Tapping his abundant vocabu

upon Hill, harmony and the dove of Democratic
peace, until he made the scene look more like a fair

prodigals.
MORE HARMONY.
.The attempt^of Governor Gage to bring his
critics hundreds of -miles away ; ,from their
place of business and from tho evidence, to be.
sat upon by his own chosen Dogberry, can be
looked upon only in the light of a retreat â and
not a "masterly retreat" either.

SAN DIEGO TRIBUNE t
Governor Gage's .action In bringing suit
against the San Francisco Call at an out of the
way place like San Pedro, a little town on the
coast five hundred miles from San Francisco,
is not likely to impress unprejudiced people
with the belief that the Governor's most sin
cere motive is : to ; have the case tried on its
merits. Such persons will not escape the con
viction that "something" .â¢' is back of such a
move. If.. Gage had desired a . complete and
public trial of those against- whom*- he has
brought suit, at the place where an action, at
law could be had with as little expense to the
State as possible and with consideration for
facility of access to the evidence In the case,
there appears no reason why he should not
have sued The Call In the city where it is pub
lished. Surely the courts of San Francisco or
of. Sacramento, his home, are not less capable
of restoring pristine beauty to a damaged repu
tation than those of Wilmington Township, on
the borders of San Pedro Slough. Governor
Gage will not be held unaccountable to the pub
lic in his -new method of spending its money.
The witnesses and the evidence in this suit, if
it shall be brought to trial in Wilmington
Township, must be brought and returned hun
dreds of miles. The records and the controll
er's office at San Quentin will furnish the evi
dence for both sides. San Quentin is about live
hundred miles from Wilmington . Township.
But the "little seaside resort chosen by Gaze
for the revelation of his aforesaid pristing
purity is in the county of Los Angeles, where
reside his particular, fronds and cronies.
It remains to be seen whether the State must
pay the expenses of this vagary. of Its unde
sirable adornment in the gubernatorial chair
FRESNO DEMOCRAT!
XMOt nearly, enough has been said relative to
the attempt Governor Gage is making to vin
dicate his character by resort to the ' courts.
It appears to have escaped the attention of the
newspaper writers that the Governor, In re
sorting to the Justice court â¢ of Wilmington
Township, Lbs Angeles County, is defeating
the object he-claims to have in -view the vin

paper men at San Pedro, a village way down
in the southern part of the State â that it is
purely one of - sentiment, - as it was Â¦ there that
he. began his career . in California â appears to
the public to be a very poor reason. It means
a heavy expense to. the taxpayers in having to
take witnesses, records, etc., to such an obscure
place, when the suits could Just as well have
been brought at Sacramento or near the San
Quentin prison anywhere. The people are in
terested in knowing- Â¦ about the case. We do
not believe the Governor is guilty of. the petty
criminal i acts with which he is charged, for
pilfering from the. State, but he should not put
the State to any more expense to prove his in
nocence than Is necessary.
HANFORD JOURNAL:
With what seems peculiar unanimity, the an
nouncement that "Gage's nomination is con
ceded by shrewd San Francisco politicians"
has appeared in a whole lot of papers. And
still more peculiar and singular it Is that a
majority of these papers are either Democratic
or of strong Democratic leanings. Guess s the
shrewd Democratic politicians are doing ' all
they can to get Gage nominated. What for?
You guess.
REDLANDS CITROGRAPH:
The esteemed morning contemporary seems
quite alone in the defense of Governor Gage in
his. effort to. create a large bill of expense in
compellng principals and witnesses to go to San
Pedro to attend in a court of Justice In case of
criminal libel. The taking of testimony in a
preliminary examination could be had in Marin
County, where the prison is located, or at Sac
ramento, where the law says the Governor
must reside, as well as in the town of San
Pedro, five hundred miles away. It will not
be denied that the action of the Governor In
the preliminary Work shows a' weakness at
least. It is a fact that Gage vetoed several
claims at the last session of the Legislature, a
matter of economy, eo claimed, but he forgets
this question of economy in the interest of the
people when vindicating his personality.
MARYSYIIXK DEMOCRATS
Because Governor Gage cannot be re-elected
â if there were no other, reason â his nomina
tion would be the acme, and the ultimate of
political folly. Unless a political party can
go 'into a campaign with a fair assurance of
victory, It cannot hope to maintain ! in any
practicable way the principles which it pro
fesses. The Republican party, if It would elect
the next Governor, of California, must not
weight itself down with a candidate who . al
ready stands in the shadow of certain and In
evitable defeat. ".'
FRESNO REPUBLICAN :
It will not be much trouble for anybody to, exer
cise that much of care, and the property at stake is
worth the care it entails. In San Francisco we have
never had such disastrous fires as have- swept large
cities in the East, nor are we likely to have, for our
summer climate and our. building material are not
so conducive to fires as are those of Eastern, cities.
Nevertheless we -will surely suffer heavy losses
sooner or later if we are careless. The suggestions
of the underwriters' bureau should be followed. ' Let
us try to have a. Fourth of July whose celebration
will not be marred by any accident to \ person or
property.
A word of warning to property holders has been
issued from the Fire Underwriters' Inspection Bu
reau, and should be given due heed by the people
generally. Among the precautions suggested are
these: "If you have private fire apparatus, see that
the hose, fire pails and extinguishers are in service
able condition. If you have asmall hose attach it
in the most available place. Many kinds of business
require the use of pails, tanks and barrels. These
should be filled with water and distributed advanta
geously during the dangerous period. All rubbish
should be removed from basements into which grat
ings open, and all outside doors to basements should
be securely closed. Wooden sidewalks and planked
areas should be kept wet. Remove all packing boxes,
goods in cases and rubbish from sidewalks, areas and
roofs. Boxes that are necessarily, left outside should
be 1 piled snugly and no packing material left ex
posed."
WITH the approach of the Fourth it be
hooves the people ' to take precautions
against 'the probable outbreak of disastrous
fires.' The liberty and even license which American
custom and patriotism permit in the use of fireworks
for the celebration of the day invariably result in
danger to life and property. , In former, years Amer
ican cities have suffered heavily from Fourth of July
fires, and while of late there has been, a more care
ful regulation, of the use of fireworks, the day is still
one of more than usual peril to property, and vigil
ance is needed to guard against the danger.
BEWARE OF FIRE.
After all Whitelaw Reid is to come home without
having a chance to wear his â¢ coronation breeches^
but he has the satisfaction of knowing he can l^ave
them to his family as an heirloom.
On the Pacific Coast everything is serene. We are
still enjoying a profusion of almost everything,
money included, though this, latter '"statement will
hardly be indorsed by the average man.
The Eastern money markets are expecting a fine
windfall on the first of July in the form of over $120,
000,000 in interest and dividends, of which the rail
roads will pay in dividends some $22,000,000 and in
dustrial concerns over $26,000,000, the aggregate div
idend list reaching $55,000,000. Interest on the va
rious bonds, private and governmental, will amount
to about $69,000,000. All of this money coming into tha
market will probably give further ease to the finan
cial situation. A noteworthy feature of the dividend
showing is the decrease in industrial dividends, as
compared with July, 1901, the loss being ascribed
to the changing of the dividend dates of several cop
per companies, and in fact to the reduction in the
copper dividends themselves. â
The important cereals, such as wheat, corn

hides arc still active and steady. Wool is firmly
held, but at quotations which tend to restrict the de
mand. Provisions are also so high that buyers are
purchasing only from hand to mouth, and hogs are
higher* than at any time this year, with continued
light receipts at the Western packing centers.
The first half of the year, just closed, to employ
the phraseology of cne commercial authority, has
had few equals and no superiors. While profits have
not been as large as for the past year or two, taking
all lines and the whole country into consideration,
the volume cf business has been larger. There has
been less speculation, but more legitimate
in goods. These conditions bid fair to continue.
The crop prospects of the country are fine, and all
agricultural sections report good times. The iron
and steel trades, while no longer feverish and boom
ing, have all the business they can carry, and the
consumption of steel is so large that manufacturers
find themselves obliged to import it from Europe,
owing to the congestion in the order books of the
American mills. There has lately been a quieting
down of the retail lumber trade along the Atlantic
Coast, however, and several of the minor metals,
such as copper and tin, are lower.
The coal strike, however, is still a serious derange
ment and check along the Atlantic seaboard. Pro
duction and consumption alike are materially reduced
by it, and those railroads which are more or less de
pendent upon the coal mining industry are suffering.
Aside from this particular strike, however, the in
dustrial situation is reported rather better, as a num
ber* of strikes in other lines and regions have been
settled. The railway earnings thus far in June show
ca increase of 4.6 per cent over the same period last
year. The movement of general merchandise is re
ported large all over the country, while orders for
fall delivery in the great grain-growing regions of
the West are unusually heavy for .this time of the
TRADE apparently improved somewhat last
week, and for midsummer was rather above
the average. The loss in the country's bank
clearings was only 8 per cent, compared with the
corresponding week in iooi, whereas the decrease
has lately been much more than this, and the aggre
gate clearings exceeded $2;ooo,ooo,ooo, which is also
a larger showing than has been the rule of latc. f The
failures also made a better exhibit, being 200, against
for the same week last year. Thus, as far as
these statistics go, business made a better showing.
SAN DIEGO UNION:
Was It injury to the gubernatorial reputation
or to the gubernatorial "mug" that caused
Governor Gage to flee to the watery wastes ot
Wilmington slough, to have his grief ground
through the Judicial mill at that newly-found
asylum for the bruised In spirit?
This query Is one that will suggest itself to
most people who have perused the ponderous
complaint to which the Governor made oath
as a preliminary to haling a San Francisco
newspaper proprietor and his manager before
the rather remote tribunal by the surgi'ig
slough. In that remarkable document, guber
natorial grief is set forth in most lugubrious
terms. .But it Is when the complaint reaches
the artist's portrayal of the gubernatorial
countenance that the business grows really
serious. This alleged wrong, is depicted in thÂ»
darkest colors, and the gubernatorial complain
ant seems to be^repeating: .-; i
' "Black as It was. I'd blacken it still more.
And make It blacker than it was before." .
One might suppose that the Governor is
really more troubled over his face than over
his reputation. Possibly, however, this exces
sive sensitiveness about the former is not un
natural. - It has been the custom of news
papers that support tie machine of which the
Governor Â¦ is the head, always to picture hia
face as/a delightful blending of beauty and
brains-^the commingled countenance of an
Adonis and a Webster. The executive "mug"
has been so often presented in this delightful
way that ita possessor may have been shocked
to see It portrayed differently. ' Â¦ In any event,
he has come to the- conclusion that Its por
trayal in an unflattering manner la "against
the peace and dignity of the people of the
State of California," and although those same
people have not, so far as known, made any
very loud protests against their "peace and
dignity'' being thus outraged in the guberna
torial countenance, the legal assistance of the
temple of Justice at Wilmington slough has
been Invoked, and the result will be watched
with bated breath.
In the meantime It may be suggested that
while the people have not made any violent
demonstrations over the alleged pictorial as
saults on their "peace and dignity,"- the tax
payers may say some unkind things to the
Governor should he succeed In his Old Ballsy
tactics and put them, to tha expense of a pre
liminary trial at a place remote from every
person and paper that will be needed at saca
hearing.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Although the Gage shouters have been de
claring that the farmers are in favor of him,
the returns, so far as received, flatly contradict
the claim. Six of the great grain-growing coun
ties â Tehama, Colusa. Tulare, Madera. Stanis
laus and Glenivâ have already chosen delega
tions to the State convention, and not a stngls
one of them has been Instructed to support
the Governor lor renomination. Four of the
counties pledged their delegates against mâ¢.
and two did not instruct for any one.
And yet it was confidently claimed by thÂ«
machine that the alleged reduction of taxes by
the Governor had made him so solid with UtÂ«
horny-handed sons of the soil that they would
support him to the end. What can have mads
the change? Can it be that there Is a "con
spiracy" among farmers, as well as among
newspapers, to down the Governor? This is
certainly a plausible explanation, from the
gubernatorial standpoint. Because several pa
pers which represent the political sentiment oC
their respective communities have ventured to
say that Gase's renomination would be a
calamity, the Governor promptly discovered
that they were in a conspiracy against him.
And now that the farmer counties have turned
him down.' why is it not equally reasonable to
suppose that they, top. have conspired to pre
vent him from again getting the office upon
which he seems to fancy he has amortgags?
- -It really looks as If the entire Republican
party of the State were getting implicated la
the "conspiracy" which the Governor so bit
terly denounces.
SACRAMENTO BEE I
This attempt on the part of Gags to bring
men hundred's of miles away from their horns
to ajiswer to a libel â If any libel there has
been â which was perpetrated in San Francisco,
does not seem very much like seeking a vln
dlcatlon.\ It looks more as though Gage was
determined not . so much to vindicate himself
as to put his critics to all the expense and
trouble possible. If Gage shall be permittel
to sue J. D. Spreckels and W. S. Leaks out
side of San Francisco, the suit should be com
menced in the city or Sacramento, which, ac
cording to the statutes. Is the official residence
of the Governor. .
' But then the statutes can hardly count la
this matter, for Governor Gage has frequently
shown that he is not amenable to them. An
other pointjn this connection: Why doea Gov
ernor Gage bring that suit hundreds of miles
away from the evidence? The Controller's
office and the records at San Quentin win fur
nish the evidence for both sides. TheâGov
ernor has not helped his case by getting away
from the evidence.

TRADE GAINING AGAIN.
The San Francisco Call of Thursday makes
extracts from State records to show how these
shining lights of the Los Angeles machine have
been cared for in the distribution of funds:
Ben Febneman, of local notoriety, also - has
profited handsomely in his allegiance to Gage,
who appointed him, and there are many other
members of- the "push" who have gained com
fortable allowances through the laxity with
which the purse strings of the State have been
pulled. '
One of these appointees was a man named
Bryant of San Jose, who received an appoint
ment as "inspector" from the State Board of
Health; and who came to Los Angeles without
credentials to "investigate" the conduct of the
local Health Department. Bryant received f 200
per month and expenses for doing practically
nothing, and his appointment is charged to an
effort on the part of the machine to obtain the
support of several organizations of old soldiers,
of which Bryant was a member. Bryant left
Los Angeles hurriedly after .the "Job" was
shown - up in the Times. 'â¢ Â¦
- But the "graft" strikes closer home.
Walter Moore, the disgraced fire chief
of this city, has bt en named- as the chief
beneficiary of the "bubonic plague" fund, and
during his sojourn in San Francisco he has held
various positions under the present adminis
tration, as "water expert" and in other capaci
ties, for all of which, he is said to have re
ceived goodly portions of the State's money.
Ever since the appropriation of the $100,000
"bubonic plague" fund over a year ago, the
taxpayers of the State have wondered who
got it. Reports have been received from time
to time that the money was spent by the ad
ministration in one_ manner and another for the
good of the "push," and examples were cited
of numerous appointees of the machine who
were drawing down good salaries for alleged
services.
LOS ANGELES TIMES:
It would seem that If Governor Gage has
been so grossly libeled he would have de
manded an Investigation and not run 'way
down to a Justice of the Peace in a far-off
county to file his complaint against J. D.
Spreckels and W. S. Leake. The city of San
Francisco is where the crime, if any, was
committed and there would have been tha
proper place to file his papers. The actions of
the Governor are not in keeping with his pro
testations of honesty.

Times is published in Los Angeles. It might
be logical to prosecute The Times In San

vindication "from San Francisco slander in the

we understand it, the Governor's object _ in

suppose he would seek to do this in the largest

OAKLAND ENQUIRER:
Governor Gage has commenced his libel suits
against Spreckels and Leake of The San Fran
cisco Call and General Otis of tha Los Angeles
Times. If this doesn't kill Gage for renomina

some show before, but he certainly has con

SANTA ASA HERALD:
The courts will be left to decide whether
Governor : Gage has been libeled . by the San
Francisco Call and whether the Los Angeles
Times injured the Governor's reputation 5100,
000 worth in republlshing The Call's charges
as a matter of news. . The Republicans of Cali
fornia, however, are confronted with the far
more Important matter of nominating a man
for Governor, who can unite the party and be
elected. A man who is always looking for
trouble as a rule has little difficulty in finding
it, and Henry .T. Gage- is just that sort of a
man. The Republican party of California usu
ally has troubles enough of its own on gub
ernatorial years without shouldering a lot of
Henry's. As an Individual Mr. Gage has the
inalienable and undisputed right to antago
nize everybody he chooses, but as the repre
sentative of a party he- has not. He was look
Â¦ Ing for trouble when he came to Los Angeles
as a guest of the Republican clubs and rudely
assailed his own personal enemies there; he
was looking for trouble when he addressed th-j
letter announcing his candidacy for renomina
tion .to the ..State League at San Jose, and
again. used the â¢ opportunity to attack his own
personal enemies. The Republican party of
California Is. too big and of too much Im
portance to be dragged Into the personal fights
of . nnv man no matter what his attainments
may be. Bigger men than Henry T. Gage nav e
been left on the outside to cool off on account
of their bullheadedness and pugnacity. Henry
has been looking for trouble ever since he was

it. He really ought to have all of his time

.The articles which appeared' in the San
Francisco Call relative to lax method* at' San
Quentin Prison . in . purchase of supplies and:
allowance of j claims therefor 1 have; had an
effect aside ' from- causing ' Governor Gase to
commence libel suits 'against the proprietor
and manager of* The Call. ; The Call charged
that bills had been; substituted for claims,
filed so - as to show lists of . goods differing
from those purchased, and. that these substi-.
tuted claims were not, written by employes of
the firm,- delivering ..the goods, but were the_
work of skillful convicts. Fac similes of sev
eral claims were printed by .The-Call, and such
houses- as Â¦ Levi Strauss & Co. and H. S.:
Crocker & Co. denounce them as base forgeries
and not in keeping with the claims they had
filed, i Evidently the Prison Directors agree,
with these irate wholesale merchants, as on
Saturday last they passed the following reso
lution:. â¢'..-â¢Â¦-.â¢ - -
"Resolved, That hereafter no claims be al
lowed by this board that are not made out in
the handwriting . of the . claimants and â¢ upon
original billheads of the creditors of the prison..
No original bill shall be made out in the hand
writing of any convict, and all necessary cor-,
reetions shall be made on bills in red ink in
such manner" as not to obliterate the original
words or figures." - .
That' resolution will be construed by the
average' citizen as being an indorsement of
The Call's inyestiKations. The Call charged
that bills were being made out at San Quen
tin-by convicts in place of claims which had
been made out Â« regularly by prison creditors.
If The Call's charge as to such a condition
was untrue, the resolution quoted above was
unnecessary, i The resolution is a good one; It
should have been in force long ago â but better
late than never. The -Call brought the mat
ter to the attention of the Prison Directors
and did the State a* good service in doing so.
It is now in order for the Prison Directors to
fully, carefully and moet publicly investigate
the charges made against the management of
our State prisons, and let the blame (if any
mismanagement is found) fall where it will
without regard for. politics or pull. If the
prison management Jn all branches has been
and is honest and straightforward and In ac
cord with the law,* Governor Gage will have
the best wishes for success of all people In his
suits against the editors. In justice to Gov
ernor Gaee and to all persons connected wich
our prison management ! the Investigation
should be made soon and exhaustive.
f Â¦ nHE leading Republican newspapers of California are
nearly unanimous in the proposition, that the nom
ination of Gage for Governor would result in the
; ~ defeat of the Republican party, in November. Los
Angeles is. the only" county in which the Gage sup
. Â¦ Â»- / . porters .are making an open fight for delegates. In
and Aguirre. In Northern California nothing has happened
to bring a ray of comfort to the" push.
The Governor's retreat to San Pedro for the purpose of
bringing action against The Call is generally accepted by the
press of the State as a confession of weakness upon the part
of the accused executive. If he had desired an immediate
judicial investigation of affairs at San Quentin prison _he
would have instituted proceedings at Sacramento or San
Francisco. It is now becoming clear to the public mind that
the Governor is skulking to avoid the real issue. The Gov
ernor's reputation as a "fearless fighter and astute criminal
lawyer," which was very dear to the^push, has not been en
hanced by his flight to San Pedro. The comment, of the press
on his retreat is quite interesting:
Comments of Leading Republican and Other Newspapers of the
State on the Governor's Method of Procedure in His Libel ,
Suits and on His Efforts to Retain Party Leadership. ; \
As we have said before, no people has ever yet
been led to and taught self-government. Governor
Taft, then, has a task never before undertaken by
mortal man.\ We wish him' well, and so do all his
countrymen, tut there is not a vivid condition of
interest in his work or in any of our operations in
the Philippines. The people sometimes think of the
Philippine trilemma â are the islands to be States
of this Union; are. they to be made independent and
take their place amongst the nations of the earth;
or are they to remain subordinate, to be our per
manent colonies, their people unequal with us, and
held as our subjects? One of these three policies
must be the outcome. Which will it be? Let us
hope that in the next of his noteworthy public ad
dresses the President will give the country a lucid
statement of his view.
In discussing the very worthy service of Governor
Taft the President strongly pictures him "leading
the Filipinos up the stony path toward self-govern
ment." In that task he has all the sympathy and
support of the nation. These go to him in all the
generous measure set by the- President. In all the
Harvard address it is the only reference to matters
of policy or principle, and it is vague and uncertain.
Does the President mean that Governor Taft is lead
ing the islands forward into the union as States, arid
their people as citizens of the United States? If so
the American people should know it, as there is well
nigh universal aversion and opposition to such an
outcome of this afflicting business. If the President
mean that when the end of the stony path is reached
the islands are to be made an independent, self-gov
erning nation, their ten millions of people to be cit
izens of the Philippine commonwealth, then the Fil
ipinos should know it, for it will help them over the
stony path in shorter time and with fewer bruises.
It is all right for the President to stand by the
general administrative acts of Wood and Root, but
nothing he may say will at all advance them toward
the list of public benefactors. He says that they are
attacked. That is true, but to be attacked is no sign
of merit or demerit in this country. Nobody had
to tell the people that Grant and Sherman, were great
and had rendered transcendent service. The people
knew it as they beheld it. No one had to tell them.
But Grant and Sherman were abused, and since their
day every small man who has unworthily attempted
a large thing, or, while exercising an august func
tion, has belittled it, has smugly patted his own head
and answered all criticism by placing. himself in the
class of Grant and Sherman because he is criticized.
As far as General Wood and Secretary Root are
concerned there is abroad a feeling that' is some
thing, more than negative. It is not merely lack of
recognition of trie merit of something which they
have done, but it is a recognition of things done by
them which the people do not like and do not in
dorse. The payment to Gomez and the use of many
thousands of dollars by General Wood, approved by
Secretary Root, to influence, legislation by our Con
gress, are not approved by the people and are re
garded as anything but creditable to American mo
rality.
While the President had no intention to disparage
our countrym.en, it, is quite- in order to say that they
are not 'indifferent to high merit or great achieve
ment. But these must be apparent and not depend
upon repeated statement and ascription. If Wood,
Taft and Root complain of indifference, it is because
their service, doubtless well intended and conscienti
ously rendered, has not been of the arduous or useful
character which , impresses the people. It is not recog
nized as a service needed and necessary, or as .'in
volving the personal risk which gives even unneces
sary and useless service the glamour of courage; and
sacrifice. We say it is not recognized, but that does
not mean that it is i:ot worthy, high and necessary,
useful and extremely honorable service, but only that
it is not so regarded now, and that it is not is proved
by the President's persistent effort, in nearly all of
his. public addresses, to secure the recognition that
is at present lacking^
THE addresses of the President continue to be
upon partisan yor military subjects, and are
read and studied with interest. His frankness
puts the country under obligation to him, though it
runs mainly to a discussion of persons and personal
ities, rather than of principles. His most recent ad
dress .was an elaborate and flattering -indorsement, of
General Wood, Secretary Root and Governor Taft,
only one of whom is a Harvard man. The President
gave it as his "opinion that these three have done
things which place them alongside General Kitch
ener and Lord Cromer, and compared the great re
wards bestowed by the British empire upon the lat
ter with the indifference of the American people to
the former.
GAGES WANING CAUSE AND HIS
QUEER FLIGHT TO SAN PEDRO
Why, then, should Major Watterson hark back to
this death-bed gritting of .Mr. Tilden's teeth at Cleve
land?*- The only interest felt by the country in the
matter is in the fact, now apparent, that Mr. Bryan
can be trusted to discipline Major Watterson when
ever he gets too harmonious, and ithat both can be
trusted to fall foul of Mr. Cleveland and his friends
whenever they walk abroad with the. olive branch.
Unless the law provide a pilose season for the dove
of Democratic peace she will be shot, stewed and
eaten before 1904.
He recalled with tearful bitterness of feeling that
Mr. Tilden died with expressions of aversion and dis
trust of â¢ Cleveland upon" his lips. This is news.in
deed. Mr. Tilden might have been in better business
in the solemn hour of dissolution than cussing. Mr.
Cleveland. If Watterson tell the truth Democratic
inharmony is older than Bryanism. - It is no Ken
tucky fairy tale, told to'' tickle the ijink ear of .the
star-eyed goddess of reform/' that Horatio -Seymour
had certain unfavorable opinions of Mr. Tilden, but
was too well bred to mix them in with his dying. San
ford E. Church had heartburnings against both Til
den and Seymour, but carefully excluded them- from
his judicial decisions. Great men .have bitten their
thumbs at each other before, and in Kentucky, where
they take pot shots at Governors, "the incendiary
parts' of speech, the very nitrates and picrates of the
language are overworked to satisfy the desire of such
to express their mutual aversion and distrust.
The first knight-errant of distraction to lower his
visor and put his quiU'in tilt, and let go at , -.-it v was.
Major Watterson. With the riotous exuberance .of
the leader of a lynching party, the deep, dark. spiriV of
moonshiner and the -unreasoning .desire to shoot
something that" 1 overcomes a feudist, he jumped' on
Mr. Cleveland and all his works and words, and made
the dark and bloody ground -howl again, while -he
chopped harmony with a club, and warned the; whole
country that if it doesn't lock the door and keep its
hands on its pocketbook Mr. Cleveland will Â¦ again
break into the Presidency and proceed to do the un
utterable. He gave free rein'to his alarm, and also

This, is probably Mr. Cleveland's last speech on'po
litical and party issues. No doubt it was intended to
present some common ground upon which the dis
tracted organization could meet , and take its place
as one of the* great parties in a free society/wherein
parties are necessary to the social health. But the
spirit in which it was* ..received by those for whom it
was intended shuts out any. hope, of its effectiveness.
did power. .. Another party may\ : thrive on. the ever
shifting treatment of the ever-shifting moods of pop
ular restlessness, or by an insincere play upon un
reasoning prejudice and selfish anticipation." Then,
sketching his own conception of the creed of the
party, he continued: "What but infatuation with the
visage .of -defeat Han explain the subordination of
these things by Democrats when they .prepare for
battle? Our people are too much on the alert .to ac
cept political deliverances they do not understand,'
and the enthusiasm of the rank and file does not thrive
on mystery." No 7 description of his issues and his
methods could be more galling to Mr. Bryan, and yet
who knows but he was more hurt by omission of his
UNCERTAIN POLICY.

bay excursion yesterday on the steamer
Monticello. â¢ The excursionists, a most
congenial aggregation of people, were
taken "along the city front to Hunters
Point and then to the south shore of
Marln County, through Racoon Straits,
and thence to El Campo, where they
were allowed . to disembark and remain
ashore for an hour to partake of , lunch.
The trip was then resumed and the boat
passed close to the western coast of Con
tra Costa County to give the excursion
ists an opportunity to obtain a full: and
satisfactory view, of all points of inter
est within the range of observation. Aft
er passing Selby's smelting works the
steamer continued, passing Crockett,
Port Costa and on the turn slcirting close
to Benicia.>-She then proceeded past- the
navy yard at Mare Island and the va
rious war /vessels at anchor, after which
the Tun was continued to V allejo, where
the vessel remained 1 for an hour to give
all who wished an opportunity -.o, go.
ashore . and see . the city. A . brass band
played popular airs during the trip. -

Chief* Wittman received a dispatch yes
terday morning that the officer from
Springfield, Mass., with the papers for
the extradition of J. B. Black, ' of many
aliases, would arrive here this morning.
Black is wanted there for swindling a
bank out of $385 by means of a worthless
draft. The two cases pending against him
In Judge Conlan's court will be called
this morning and will probably be contin
ued to give the officer from Springfield
time to get his papers signed by the

The Nevadan's time from New York to
this port was sixty-one days, fiom St
Lucia fifty-three days Â¦ and from Coronel
twenty-two days. She will .remain in
dock for three weeks, and In the mean
time she will be changed from coal to an
oil burner. In the future she will run
between this port and the Hawaiian Isl
ands, and will have a sugar carrying ca
pacity of 5000 tons. Sir*:
Captain Weeden, who is now in com
mand of the Nevadan, was formerly In
charge of the Eureka, running between
the Sound and the islands.
The Nevadan is 2857 tons and built on
the latest freight pattern. She has short,
thickset, turreted masts and a steel boom
capable of lifting forty tons. . She' makes
her own ice and has 600 tons of refriger
ator space.' and special fittings and ap
pliances for livestock, and can carry from
eighty to one hundred head on her upper
deck.
The captain brought a sample of the
ashes with him. They have the appear
ance of a very fine pumice stone.
Some of the crew stated that on the 7th,
toward midnight, they heard two reports
that sounded like the firing of heavy
guns. The deck was strewn with ashes
and the lookout, when he came down,
looked like a. plaster cast.
Two days out from St. Lucia, on \ May
8, the/ captain of the Nevadan reports
the vessel ran into a storm of ashes. He
said that at 3:30 a. m. on that day the
ashes grew so thick that the fog 'whistles
had to be sounded, and at 4:30 a.' m. they
got so heavy that It was impossible to
look to windward. At 8 a. m. Lhe water
became very thick and much discolored,
and remained so during the forenoon. The
only forerunner of this ash avalanche
was a few thunder claps and flashes of
lightning. .
The captain went on to state that on
May 5 they were thirty miles from Marti
nique, and reached 'the island of St. ' Lu
cia on the following day. Here they re
ceived news from a" small French steam
er of the first eruption of Mont Pelee.
The Frenchman had recently returned
from Martinique, bringing in some of the
injured. The captain reported a sad in
cident that had occurred during the lava
overflow at Martinique. A father and
son had been out walking and were soou
made to realize the danger they were in.
They tried to escape from, the lava that
was racing toward them, but the- aged
father was unable to get away quickly
enough and was swallowed up in the fiery
stream. The son, more fortunate, made
good his escape.
later steamed slowly up the bay
to" her moorings at the Steuart-str.eet
dock. Captain H. F. Weeden, who had
charge of her from Coronel, where Cap
tain Delano left her to return to New
York to bring out the sister ship Nebras
kan, which is now nearly ready for ser
vice, stated that he had encountered
head winds part of the voyage, but he
was well content with the time, which
was sixty-one days from New York.'

One of these started In each group, and
made one complete circle of the triangle,
eight and one-third miles-.
The San Francisco Wheelmen were un
fortunate, four of their riders sustain
ing falls. No one was badly Injured. The
official table shows the time made, by each
rider. E. Hearther of the Oakland Wheel
men is credited with having made the
fastest time. He covered the course In
22 minutes and 15 seconds. The official
table:
D. Williamson made the last relay for
Oakland. Owing to the good time made
by his clubmates he received the packet
he was to carry nearly two minutes ahead
of his nearest competitor. Although each
of these covered the course In faster
time than he rode it they were unable
to cut down all his lead. He finished 1
minute 25 2-5 seconds ahead of E. A.
Mitchell of the California Cycling Club.
He, In turn, beat A. L. Knox by one-fifth
of a second, hardly more than a wheel's
lene^h.
The race Is an Interclub affair, which
will be run annually hereafter.. It is lim
ited to the Oakland Wheelmen, San Fran
cisco Wheelmen and California Cycling
Club. This bars the powerful teams of
the Garden City Wheelmen and Bay City
Wheelmen, and will have the effect of
building up the weaker organizations. Tho
clubs will subscribe each year for a sil
ver trophy, which will be won outright.
The contest yesterday was well handled
under the racing and record committee of
California Associated Cyclists. This Is
made up of C. I* McEnerney. (chairman),
A. E. Berg, A. W. Morganstern, K S.

Reilly's clean-shaven front Is keeping
up its reputation as a good luck steeret.
It made the Angels run according to the
wise dope on Saturday, and yesterday it
cfiused the Oakland whirlwinds to do the
honors as rear guard to the southerners
in both little arguments. Tbe score In the
morning game at Oakland was 10 iO 2,
and at Recreation Park i to 0.
Reilly thinks all the credit is due to the
crop of hair he has concealed in a bottle
somewhere, but the fans say it is all up
10 the swell way of playing the game
which the Angels have lately become
jerry to. They simply played the leaders
to a standstill, and always won out when
Oakland was standing still. If the
champs once got a heavy start Morley's
punchers wouid not have a chance.
Oscar Jones and the noble Byron Hart
well have rightfully landed all the glory,
honor and credit, and should be handed
& raise in salary. Both of these unas
suming youths of the south pasted out
the elusive horsehide in a manner which
made the leaders' batting averages look
like Chinese money in tiie Unitetl States
mint. Oakland was always guessing, and
the longer they guessed the more they
had coming.
Recreation Park resounded with the
hearty cheer and noisy kick of nearly
10,000 wild and rabid luns, who taid un
kind things to the umpire because they
liad no one else at whom to kick. The
game seemed to hold their interest to a
certain degree, but whenever it became
at ail elow the sun gods and their more
exclusive brethren who held down the
Â« hair6 in the stand would begin to say a
lew things to the ruler of the field.
It was a brilliant game of ball, but the
result was never in doubt. If belonged
to Los Angeles from the fourth on, and
although they did not have a big lead the
Oaklandcrs could not connect wxth Jones'
curves in enough bunches to bring in
runs. Cristall for the first time since his
appearance was hit hard and often, and
but for the magnificent support he re
ceived the Angels would have bummered
in about a dozen tallies.
Ail the runs were the result of timely
hitting until the ninth inning was
reached. Then the sunbeamers resorted
to strategy, und it worked in admirable
style. Bill Hanlon was the main strate
gist. In the ninth, when he was on third
and two gone, he made one wild dash for
the plate. It unnerved Cristall to such
an extent that he threw wide. Hanlon
scored amid the frantic cheering of the
delighted populace.
Oakland tried time and again to get a
man over the jumps, but all Its efforts
met with the same result. Xo one could
hit Jones safely to any damaging extent j
and the Angel players refused to make
ajiy errors. As a. result the suburban
Â¦wonders were blanked for the second
time this week.
OAKLAND,
The real exciting bit of play came to
Phfs in the Angel portion of the fifth.
iianlon v,as running from second on a
single by Lawler, and Lohman received
Gorton's throw just before Hanlon ar
rived. It was a trifle wide, but Lohman
reached over and apparently touched the
runner. McDonald called Hanlon safe. A
great uproar prevailed for a few minutes,
the crowd all yelling for Oakland. Pro
tests were in vain and the run was al
lowed. Lohman had his hand badly cut
by Hanlon's spikes and was forced to re
tire In favor of Gorton, Schmidt going to
center field. Roach was also injured in
the eighth and Anderson took his place.

Peachmark, the Famous Setter, Dies.
Sportsmen will learn with deep regret
of the death" of Peachmark. the pride of
W. "W. Van Arsdale's splendid kennel of
English setters and the greatest of tho
breed on -this coast. "Peachy," as she
was known to her familiars, won the all
age stake in the Pacific Coast field trials
three times. Her progeny are also dis
tinguishing themselves on the field. Ot
these Lady was first in the derby in 1301
and second in the all-age stake the same
year. Peach Blossom was second in the
derby to Lady and won the all-age from
the latter. Peachmark was of most aris
tocratic bearing and was a picture, when
in the field, to delight either artist or
layman.

This was her third attempt at suicide.
With her husband she went to a cheap
lodging- house on Main street on April 15.
and after writing a joint note, in which
they stated that they had determined to
<Lie together, both took chloral and mor
phine in quantities sufficient to kill sev
eral persons. Baker was dead when
lound, but his wife's life was saved.
She then declared that she would join
her husband, and three weeks later she
t\ent to another lodging-house and after
i losing all the cracks around the doors
Â£nd windows turned on the gas. Again
siie was discovered before life was ex

1-efore her husband'e death he had made
her swear that she would follow him, and
she repeatedly asserted that she would
keep her oath.

Beach bathhouse at Santa Monica. In

The Cicily meantime had lost five min
utes more in Jibbing.' All the yachts -with
t.'.eir spinnakers boomed out on starboard
then started for the second mark, seven
miles away. The Meteor rounded the sec
end mark a long way ahead of the other
yachts, and when she started on the
homeward leg of eleven miles it was al
most completely calm. All the excursion
steamers left the racers at this point. The
yuchts were drifting hopelessry.
The sailing committee has decided that
If the Meteor beats the Cicily the latter
yacht shall be given a special prize, in
view of the complications which arose
from the change of orders.
The Friday race has been awarded to
the Cicily. In this contest the Meteor
Unished 7 minutes 22 seconds ahead of
the Cicily, but under her time allowance
tnc English boat won by 1 minute and 11
seconds.
Acting under these instructions* the
Cicily rounded the mark and started for
home; but Emperor William objected to
this change of the course because the
Meteor was coming on the reach, which
would show her best points. The sailing
committee countermanded its previous in
structions.
As the wind had dropped a good deal,
the sailing committee decided to shorten
tho course by one side of the triangle
and to instruct the yachts to come home
direct from the first mark. The com
mittee consequently borrowed all the
available steam launches in the neigh
borhood and, with a member of the com
mittee on board each, the launches start
ed to intercept the yachts and inform
them of the decision before they rounded
the first mark.
The wind was dead ahead for the . en
tire distance to the first mark, twelve
miles from the starting point. At the end
of an hour the Meteor worked out ahead
of the Cicily, which had already distanc
ed the other contestants. Tne Cicily
challenged the Meteor for the weather
berth, slowly passed her and lengthened
her lead. The time at the first mark was
as follows:
Cicily, 3 hours 24 minutes 40 seconds; Me
teor, a hour* 2Â» minutes SO seconds.
The yachts, carrying full light-weather
canvas, crossed the starting line at 11:35
yesterday in the following order: The
Lacsa, the Clara, the Cicily, the Iduna,
the Nordwest and the Meteor.
KIEL, June 30â9 a. m.â Emperor Wil
liam's American-built schooner yacht, the
Meteor, the Cicily, owned by Cecil Quen

which started in the schooner race to
day are drifting toward home. The Me

This is not Dr. Soldan's -first visit to
the coast. He has attended meetings of
the National Educational Association,
which have been held In San Francisco
and Los Angeles. -
BERKELEY, June 29.â F. Louis Soldan,
LL.D., Superintendent of Instruction of
\hp Public Schools of St. Louis and
acknowledged as one of the foremost edu
cators of. ice' Middle West, Is in Berkeley.
He has come to conduct courses in peda
gogy In the university . summer school,
which opens" to-morrow. . ..,
The presence of Dr. Soldan in the de
partment of education of the vacation
school at Berkeley lends a large amount
of importance to that branch of learning,
for his theoretical Knowledge of the sub
ject is backed by a record of thirty-nine
years' active experience in every branch
of the School Department of St. Louis.
Dr. Soldan first made a nsyne for him
self as director of the St. Louis Normal
School, one of the largest institutions of
its kind in the country. After holding this
position for twenty-four years he was ele
vated in 1S96 to the office of Superintend
ent of Public Instruction, which position
he now holds* Besides this he is a lec
turer at Washington University and at
the University of Missouri.
The St. Louis educator's wide experience
in school affairs will make his lectures at
the summer session of the State Univer
sity authoritative. His two courses of lec
tures here on "Practical Education" and
"School Administration" will embrace
questions concerning the administration of
public and - normal schools, functions of
school boards and the curriculum of com
mon schools and high schools.
Dr. Soldan has much to say in praise
of the school system of St. Louis.
"We feel that we hold a unique posi
tion among the ' school systems of the
country," said he, "because It was at St.
Louia - that the system of public kinder
gartens was first established-, "twenty
seven years ago, and there they have
reached the highest degree of efficiency.
Out of eighty-eight public schools, seventy
have a kindergarten department attached.
Every new schoolhouse erected includes a
special room for kindergarten work.
"Our system of school administration is
unique and during the six years of its
operation ha3 . been eminently successful.
All executive work is in the hands of the
heads of departments. The Superintend
ent of Instruction nominates all teachers
and school employes and their names are
accepted or rejected by the Board of Edu
cation. The same holds for all textbooks
used in the schools." ;
It seemed as if every person in Santa
Cruz was at the closing service held at
the armory this evening. It commenced
at 6:30 o'clock with a vesper service, con
ducted by the Rev. Francis Reed of Paso
Robles. The devotions were led by Dr.
Sara- Wise of San Francisco. The ad
dresses of the- evening were on "Soul
fcktving," by W. A. Kling, secretary-of the
Oakland Y. M. C\ A., and the convention
sermon, "Not I, but Christ," by the Rev.
W. H. Scudder of Berkeley, The closing
consecration service was led by Giles Kel
logg of San Diego.
While the junior rally was in progress
a mass meeting was held in the armory.
A temperance address on "The Law vs.
the Saloon" was given by \V. P. Neth
erton.- An address on "The Â¦Â« Power of
a Noble Life" was- given' by the Rev.
Harry Hilllard of San Luis. Obispo, who
was followed by the Rev. H. F. Briggs.
P'ollowing the mass meeting was a big

other meeting in Chinatown. ...Â¦-"- *

This afternoon the juniors in large num

ers were Giles Kellogg of Ban Diego and
Lionel Rodgers, who is in' charge of a
junior, society of 156 members at*Berke
ley, â¢ Â¦'.â¢Â¦Â¦. . *
This feature of the meeting was' more
impressive than all that had; preceded it.
In the brilliant midst of "a fire of flowers
arid glowing gr^ss" the singers stood and
rendered " most , v melodiously ' the : sacred
songs. Then on the stretch of sand be
low, at the very edge of tho "image of
eternity," they knelt and prayed. An
earnest address on "The Inducement for
Power", was delivered by the Rev. Harry
Hllliard of San LUis Obispo.

Garbed in the robes of his office, with

then administered the sacrament of con

DELIVEKS ELOQUENT ADDRESS.
Following the confirmation Archbishop
Riordan advanced to the altar rail and
addressed the children and their friends.
He said, in part:
The Archbishop and the clergy entered
the church after the children's procession .
arrived, the voices of the little ones blend
ing In a hymn with the strains of the or
gan. .
After the rendition of Lombardi's "VenI
Creator," sung by Miss Wadsworth, Sig
nor Cortesi and J. A. Fogarty. the chil
dren were addressed in French by Rev.
Father Hamet. The priest eloquently
dwelt upon the sacred obligations that
the communicants were about to take and
exhorted them to lead pure lives and be
faithful to their vows.
The children formed in procession in the
Sunday-school In the basement of the
church, and, led by the parish clergy,
marched in procession to the street " and
entered the church by the main doors. .
The altar of the church was a glowing'
mass of flowers and lighted candles, and
the attending clergy wore their full vest
ments.
Archbishop Riordan was attended by
Bishop Julius Chartron of Osaka. Japan;
Rev. Father Ramm of St. Mary's Cathe
dral, Rev. Father Caraher of St. Francis,
Rev. Father A. Hamet, pastor of -Notre
Dame des Victoires, and the assistant
clergy. Rev. Fathers J. Gulbert and J.
Dreyer. ' . . . -
The boys were dressed in â¢ black suits
and wore white gloves and ties, while
the girls presented a very pretty picture,
being gowned in complete white, with long
veils and gloves and wreaths of blossoms.
The interior of the sacred edifice was
crowded to the doors by the relatives and
friends of the children, and the service
of confirmation was very impressive.
ONE hutidred and fifty boys and
girls were confirmed yesterday
afternoon by Archbishop RIordan
at the Church of Notre Dame des
Victoires on Bush street, near
Stockton. .':?"Â£
E. J. Morgan will have something of a
chance this week at the Grand Opera
house with the part of Mephisto - i n
This Is the heydey of the dramatic sea
son In San Francisco. A company like
that now foregathering at the Columbia
Theater would make heydey anywhere.
Henry Miller promised us a good com
pany, and he has magnificently fulfilled
hifc promise. Each new performance I ex
hibits the band of players in new. de
lights, and no one Interested. in dramatic
art' at its best can afford to miss the
Miller people in anything they do, once
at Iea6t in each play presented. Take
"The Gay Lord Quex," the week's bill,
for example. There is Miss Anglin as the
manicurist, Sophy Fullgarney, a quite
new figure on the stage and one striking
ly foreign to any character that the gift
ed young artist has before assumed. Miss
Anglin has drawn a portrait of the cock-
ney girl that is incarnate humor, touch-
Ing it in with an intuition that is simply
extraordinary. Not a gesture or glance
destroys the illusion; the Identity be
tween actress and part is absolute. In no
net Is this so evident as in the big scene
with Lord Quex. when the contrast be
tween the shallow, pert, pretty but genu
inely sweet and heroic Sophv and the
suave, polished man of the world is splen
didly effective.' Mr. Miller's Quex seems
to Improve with every performance, gath
ering conviction and strength nightly
That it is eminently polished and elegant
goes without saying. Then there Is D'Or
say, whose malarial dandy from the West
Coast of Africa, with his "very alluring "
is a delicious bit of characterization And
Grace Elllston, the "creamy English
beauty," and Ethel Hornick. the hand
some and "mannered" Lady Eden and
Mrs. Whiffen's charming old lady all add
fine pages to the story. The play has
been enthusiastically received, and Its
second week's success is already Â¦ assured
The Russell brothers and an aggrega
tion of clever people appeared. at the Or
pheum last evening after an absence of
four years. They produced "A Romance
of New Jersey," a playlet that is ex
tremely funny. The Russels are clever
comedians and their work was highly ap
preciated. They make the most of every
line, and during their presence on the
stage the audience was convulsed with
laughter. James Thornton, "the man who
set the world a-singing," according to
the theater's press agent, lived up to his
title. He has a sweet voice and his songs
went with a swing. His stories and jokes
are new and will be repeated. Linton
and Mclntyre do a clever turn and re
ceive their meed of applause. Avery and
Hart are two colored comedians who rank
with the best. They sing and dance to
perfection. The holdovers are Mr. and
Mrs. Waterous, society comedians; Dave
Lewis, the inimitable German comedian;
Sisson and Stewart, successors to the
right, title and interest of Barnes and
Slsson, and Hallen and Fuller, who pre
sent a skit entitled "A Desperate Pair."
The biograph ends the excellent bill.
In Judith Berolde Mr. Warde has a very
strong addition to his company. Rather
over-queenly, too mature for the fragile
Francesca, in all else Miss Berolde was
found to be' not wanting. She is a beau
tiful woman and a highly intelligent and
fluent actress. Her reading is distin
guished and strongly sympathetc, and,
holding in check & full gamut of wider
emotion, her Francesca is admirably del
icate and restrained. Miss Berolde will
doubtless, however, be better seen in
stronger roles. Miss May Warde plays
the maid, Ritta. with a quaint touch, and
the rest of the cast fills in well. The
piece Is conspicuously well mounted, the
church picture, with its flaming altar and
fine quartet and picturesque setting, be
ing of the very good things In church
scenes that have been done here. ".;-"
The Pepe of Barry Johnstone, who had
not quite the hang of the house, and
therefore was not always easily audible,
was a lithe, and clever effort. Its malice
Is not quite sufficiently accentuated, but
Mr. Johnstone has a firm grip - on the
humor of the part. His scene in the gar
den, where the licensed giber discovers
Paolo and Francesca's love, is admira
bly handled and affords a -welcome relief
to the gloom, of the story. As Paolo Law
rence Hanley was at first a disappoint
ment, and, indeed, did not show his met
tle until the fifth act. But the Paolo who
stood like a wooden Indian at his lady
love's wedding, end to t his own
crippled brother, roused ' in the
garden scene to Â«a properly ardent
lover, indeed with a very pretty
poetic sense. Quite as delicately man
aged was Mr. Hanley's final scene, and
possibly there was reason good for his
earlier flatness. Charles D. Herman and
Francis McGinn were a very weak and
mild couple as the warring lords of Ri
mini and Ravenna.
From the Lanciotto of Frederick Warde
to the Francesca of Judith Berolde, in
Boker's "Francesca da Rimini," given
last night at the California Theater, there
seems to be every reason- for reviving .{he
old play. The audience,' a large one, en
joyed it thoroughly, cheerfully hissing
the unlucky commuter who made an un
timely exit during the hush of the 'last
act, and giving rapt attention and hearty
applause to the whole performance. Mr.
"Warde was hailed in the customary
noisy fashion and made his usual speech
in his usual apt manner. Other members
of the company also achieved rapid favor,
and, take it all In all, the Boker play is
possibly the most comfortable thing In
the Warde repertoire. The edition is the
Lawrence Barrett one, still further, and
to ita vast advantage, blue-penciled into
bounds. There is yet another bit of blue
pencil needed. Almost all of that which
follows the jester's death in-the Jifth act
is superfluous and weakening. Ten words
would tell the story and> immensely
strengthen the situation. But the play
as It stands is highly picturesque and ef
fective, and it goes.
Mr. Warde's Lanciotto lacks some
what the bitterness, the stern ttber, the
gloom that one has been apt to associate
with the character. It is a sweeter, more
lovable Lanciotto he paints, the victim of
high Providence, but little warped in na
ture. Sympathy is immediately created
and perfectly held for the character by
the actor in its. sad and simple nobility.
The conception Is further marked by a
thorough consistency and balance, and Is
notably free from the staginess â¢" that
sometimes mars Mr. Warde's work. As
always with this actor, the part is richly
read, the sonorous and well-modulated
voice being a continual pleasure to the
ear. Perhaps the church scene leaned
slightly to rant, but the scenes with the
malicious jester on the eve of the crip
ple's marriage with Paolo in the first act
where he cries to heaven in his sorrow,
and more than all the last scene with his
helplessly sinning wife and brother, tlie
actor's efforts were luminous with reserva
and measure. . j
Work on buildings on which brotherhood men
â¢ire employed will come to a standstill. Con
tractors who are under bonds to complete con
tracts within certain periods will find them
selves seriously handicapped.- Scarcely a con
tractor but has brotherhood men in his employ
â¢uid the enforcement of the resolution means
tnnoyance, if not positive loss to him. A
meeting of the contractors probably wlil be
fceld to-morrow, at which time some definite
action will be taken. In my opinion the reso
lution will be repealed and the carpenters in-
Jonned that the contractors will recognize and
employ all bona flde union men, be they affil
iated with the Euilding Trades Council or not.
There was considerable activity at the
headquarters of the district council of the
brotherhood last night. The officers of
that organization said they were prepar
Â«d for Uie fight to-morrow, . but they did
not expect there would be much trouble.
The opinion was expressed that the con
tractors would go back on their resolu
tion because any other course must end
In disaster to them. It was said that sev
eral contractors had officially Informed
the council that they would refuse to car
ry out the resolution and that If such ac
tion was demanded of them they would
resipn from the association.
mr^VB^w^' a ? a rule, inclined to assist
that "organization in its battle against
the brotherhood men, they are not dis
posed to do so at their own expense. That
tlie proposed lockout will prove a costly
experience many of the builders are
agreed. A leading contractor, in discuss
in? the situation yesterday, said: - '.- '
The resolution to ignore carpenters who are
not supplied with the working: card of the
Building Trades Council was adopted under a
misapprehension. Many of the builders did
sot fully understand its Import or they would
Siave voted it down. The builders are not In
clined to discriminate against any union men.
be they affiliated with the Building Trade*
Council or the United Brotherhood of Carpen-
Ttrs and Joiners of America. When they were
eeked to use their best offices to bring the dis
pute between the rival factions to an end It
was believed by some that radical measures
were necessary. The resolution to ignore the
brotherhood men was therefore submitted and
adopted.
Nearly all who voted in favor of the proposi
tion now realize that its enforcement means the
tying up indefinitely of thousands of dollars'
â¢worth of work. Since the trouble began dozens
Â«f jobs which were to have been begun were
held in abeyance pending a settlement of the
dispute. Sow that it Is proposed to carry out
a. policy of discrimination against brotherhood
carpenters the investment of capital In build-
Ings necessarily must be diminished.
Ksatistied members of the
rsierday over the adoption
h of policy as regards the
des Council. While the con-
=!?
The Builders' Protective Association is
es a house divided against itself. The reso
lution recently adopted by that body pro
tiding that after to-day no carpenters
Â¦who cannot display the working card of
the Building Trades Council will be re
fused employment is responsible for the
trouble. If this resolution is carried out j
the brotherhood carpenters to the num- I
ber of 1S00 in this city will be locked out,
Â¦with results to the building Industry
Â¦which it would be hard to foretell.
In -anticipation of trouble the City Front
Federation has appointed a committee of
five to act with like committees of the
Labor Council and Building Trades Coun
cil. A joiiit meeting of these committees
Is scheduled for this evening, at which
time the situation will be canvassed. The

The brotherhood men are curious to
know what action the Labor Council will
Take in the event of a lockout of the car
penters. The loyal unions of the brother
hood are affiliated with the Labor Coun
cil and not with the Building Trades
Council. A member of the Labor Council
