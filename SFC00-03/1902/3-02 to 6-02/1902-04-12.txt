SCENES AT . BRUSSELS, . WHERE, Dl'RING THE PAST FEW DAYS.
THERE HAVE \ BEEN- MANY SERIOUS ENCOUNTERS IN THE
STREETS BETWEEN. THE POLICE AND MOBS OF SOCIALISTS.
Senator Hanna hurried to Senator De
pew's Bide as if to encourage him to re
ply.
j As soon as Senator Blackburn took his
'aeat Senator Depew was recognized to
reply. Without the least show of excite
ment the New York Senator briefly de
fended his motives for bringing forward
the resolution, and then formally an
nounced that he would not be a candidate
for re-election to the Senate from New
York. jl.WlMlLyi
There was a buzz of excitement
throughout the chamber and several Sen
ators changed their seats uneasily as If
something more exciting might follow.
WILL NOT RUN AGAIN.
Then with all the contempt and indig
nation that he was capable of showing
and cpeaklng within the rules the Sen
ator from Kentucky fairly hissed: "Must
the Supreme Court of the State, the Su
preme Court of the United States reverse
Its judgment, change Its opinion and
ccxne here to learn law from a distin
guished, conspicuous corporation railroad
attorney?"
Blackburn then went on to review thÂ«
-recent, elections in Kentucky which re
sulted in his return to the Senate ana
ehowed that Senator Depew had been
mistaken in some of his statements, al
though the Kentucklan characterized
them as being either without the shadow
cf truth or a display of total ignorance
on the part of the Senator from New
Tcrk. In defending the Goebel law Sen
ator Blackburn ridiculed Senator Depew
for attempting to override decisions of
the courts on that subject with only
newspaper reports to Justify the false
conclusion.
As he delivered these words Senator
Blackburn stood in the middle aisle and
ehook his finger threateningly at the Sen
ator from New York.
JOE BLACKETTKN'S RETORT.
SenatOT Blackburn entered the chamber
and procured a copy of the official re
porter's notes showing what Senator De
pew had stated in connection with the
Goebel elections law in Kentucky. There
was fire in the Kentucklan's eye and re
sentment In his voice as he arose to re
ply. He arraigned Senator Depew sav
agely for going out of his way to arouse
et this particular time a sectional issue.
He charged him further with being the
"first man to shake the withered reed of
reconstruction and the first to excavate
and revitalize the bloody shirt."
Pointing his finger scornfully at the
Democrats Senator Depew declared that
if manhood suffrage was enforced in the
States of Kentucky, Virginia and North
Carolina Republican Senators . would
now be representing those States instead
of Democrats.

in the matter, as he would not be a can

W.. WASHINGTON, April 1Lâ There
was a lively interchange of personalities
In the Senate chamber to-day between
Senators Depew and Blackburn, and for
a few minutes a repetition of the Till

trouble arose over Senator Depew's pro
posed amendment to the resolution to
provide for the election of Senators by

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KLERKSDORP, Thursday, April 10.â
The representatives of the Orange Free
State and- the Transvaal Governments
held conferences yesterday afternoon and
to-day. The deliberations were, confined
to the delegates. .
KLERKSDORP, April 9.â The approach
of President Steyn and Generals Dewet
and Delarey, with their staffs, who ar
rived here at noon to-day, was signalized
at.ll a. m. by the arrival of a flag "of
truce at an outpost. An officer, with an
escort, was sent out and the President
and the two generals rode in to Klerks
dorp in Cape carts. The Orange Free
State envoys were accompanied by Judge
Hertzogg, Commandant jj Olivier and six
other persons. , With General Delarey
were his secretary and a dozen Boers.
The Free . State representatives were
quartered in the old town. General De
larey; Joined the Transvaal party In the
new town. A conference tent was pitched
midway between the two towns" and free
communication was permitted the Boer
delegates, t 'but they were suitably
guarded. ' . Â¦-
AT PEACE CONFERENCE,
General Methuen's dispatch on the sub
ject of the Tweebosch disaster was pub
lished in the Gazette this evening. It
adds nothing to the details already made
public." Methuen pays tribute' to the Boer
commander, saying General Delarey
"treated the prisoners and myself, with
the greatest kindness and left General
Cellier to look after 'our wounded on the
ground." *
In the House of \ Commons A. J. Bal
four, the Government leader, replying to
a question asked by Sir. Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, the Liberal leader, declared
that the Government had no Information
concerning peace rumors and that there
was no foundation for them. |
Inquiries . last night at the War Office
elicited the statement that the office knew
nothing about the rumors of peace or the
alleged telegram from Lord Roberts J to
Dover, in which he is reported to have
said the war was over.
PEACE RUMORS DENIED.
"We have no information at all, nor in
the nature of -things could there be any."
The sudden AcaJIIng, ota] Cabinet": zneei-f
ing and thef act that King Edward rather
unexpectedly terminated his cruise yes
terday in order, to return to London con
vinced people that something important
is pending and has led to the most ex
traordinary rumors. Among other things
It is rumored that Chamberlain; the Colo
nial Secretary, has resigned; This Is quite
untrue. Chamberlain was suffering from
a chill yesterday, but he expects to at
tend the Cabinet meeting to-day.
"Mr. Balfour's denial last night of the
peace rumors was very emphatic. He
said: '. ' ......
CABINET MEETING CALLED.
"I am not in a position to make any
statement, nor am I able to add anything
to my statement of yesterday regarding
the conference with the- Boers." .
Brodrick was asked if Lord Kitchener
had been Â¦ authorized to offer any terms
of peace besides unconditional surrender.
He replied:
. War Secretary Brodrick informed the
House of Commons that the Government
had received no communication from the
Boer leaders, regarding the terms of peace
and said that no armistice, would be
granted during the .absence of the Boer
leaders from their commands.
Preparations here continue for the dis
patch of 20,000 additional troops for the
winter campaign. Lord Roberts yester
day, inspected the first draft of the
Guards, which will sail for South Africa
next week. . , '
LONDON, April 12.â That the fighting
continues in South Africa is shown by a
casualty list given out yesterday, which
contains the names of a few of the killed
and wounded in engagements which oc
curred at three separate points as late as
the 8th and 9th of April.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â Secretary
Root is not now in a position to take
any action with regard to the allegations
of extreme military measures on the part
of General Smith, who commanded the
American troops in the island of Samar,
which had been made public in the Wal
ler court-martial at Manila. The Secretary
said to-day that if General Smith had
committed a breach of the, rules of war
In the Samar campaign, the War Depart
ment will take steps to discipline that
officer. Up to this time, it is said, the
statements concerning General Smith's
administration have been made only in
the taking of evidence at the court-mar
tial, and have not been presented In an
official manner to the Secretary of War.
AS TO GENERAL SMITH.
The judge advocate. Major Kingsbury,
of the Third Cavalry, will reply to-mor
row.
At the conclusion of the arguments for
the defense, the general- feeling was that
the result of the trial would be the ac
quittal of the major.
Captain Arthur T. Marix, Marine Corps,
representing Major Waller, in a forceful
argument, maintained that Waller's ac
tions were justified by martial law, quot
ing numerous authorities on the subject.
Captain Marix also said he regretted that
the prosecution had seen fit to call Gen
eral Smith. He claimed that all the tes
timony went to show that the major was
justified. x
ARGUES FOR WALLER.
. "It is impossible ,to conceive -such
treachery as that of 'the natives of Sa
mar," said the major. "They revel in
blood and have aji appetite, for. wanton
sacrilege of the human body. These
fiends stole Captain Cornell's class ring,
filled the soldiers' bodies with jam and
jelly and attempted to murder my com
mand. I shot them. I honestly thought
then that I was right, and I ' believe so
now. Neither my people nor the world
will believe me to be a murderer."
No protest was made and he had every
right to believe that his acts were ap
proved,; so far.. as . :.lbe ;- American Iforces
were concerned. He knew they were ap
proved by those of other nations. .
Continuing; the major said that In 1882
he was with the British ' forces in Egypt,
where Arabs captured pickets of Bengal
cavalrj'f decapitated the prisoners and
placed their heads on poles. Major "Wal
ler said all the Arabs were caught and
shot without trial. During the campaign
in China the Chinese mutilated ' the dead
and tortured the wounded to death. Con
sequently, when a Boxer or a fanatic
was captured, he was executed immedi
ately, without reference. This was true
in the case of the troops of every nation
In China. It was true during the three
weeks he commanded troops there, but
the same thing occurred there when he.
was no longer in command.
RECITES PRECEDENTS.
MANILA. April 1Lâ Major Littleton W.
T. Waller of the Marine Corps, who is
being tried by court-martial on the charge
of executing. Samar natives without trial,
addressed the court to-day. The major
said he was either right or wrong in his
actions, and added that he desired . to
cite five precedents which came under
the head of his own case. He alluded to
the naval battle of Santiago and the hu
manity he had shown the Spaniards who
were captured, and said he had many
letters from Spaniards thanking him for
the kindness he had shown them.

When yet a young man he was elected
to the Legislature, where he made a
speech against the reopening of the Afri

very unpopular with his neighbors,
though it was heartily commended h\ the
North and was pronounced by the New
York Tribune "a masterpiece of logic, di

Objected to Slave Trade.
Wade Hampton was born during a visit
of his parents to Charleston, November 3,
1818. He had private tutors at home until
he -was twelve years of age, when he en
tered the academy at Columbia. Finish-
Ing his preparation there he entered the
University of South Carolina, whence he
graduated in his twentieth year. He then
Â¦tudied law. but never engaged in . its
practice, as his father's health demanded
the son's supervision of the business of
his estates. The life suited him. As a
rider and hunter he was not excelled any
where.
Wade Hampton sprang from an ances
try that had made the name great in the
history of South Carolina from colonial
and revolutionary times; His father and
grandfather, -who bore the same name as
Himself, were men- of large wealth, and
the borne plantation near Columbia, the
capital of the State, was famed to." its
fertility and productions, as well ss for
Its magnificent mansion and the princely
hospitality always to be found within Its
walls. â¢â¢ 'â¢

Attorney Bert Schlesinger. for th-e

superintendent of the Mint, who testified
that he had occupied his present position
sincp August 1, 132)7. He told how the
racks were sealed and how they were
sented the defendant, made a
motion to have all witnesses excluded
from the courtroom until called to testify.
Judge de Haven denied the motion, and
Collins took an exceptlbn.
WHEN the trial of Walter N.
Dimmick was resumed yes

George D. Collins, who repre-
On redirect examination,. Cole, said he
was instructed by Dimmick not 'to use
any of the money out of the - racks, as
the weight of the sacks on top would

Collins then introduced in evidence pho
tographs furnished by the prosecution,
which showed the appearance of the
vault when filled, with sacks of gold.
The pictures were shown to the jury. Re
suming the examination. Collins asked:
What was your business before you suc
ceeded Dimmick aÂ» cashier?
- I was In the drug- business at ' Martinez,
California.
How many pigeonhole* were obscured by the
trucks? '
William K. Cole, of the Mint,
was next called. He is the man on whom
it is alleged Dimmick tried to fasten the
crime of stealing the $30,000 from the
Mint. Cole testified that there was a
dally inspection of the vault and that
Dimmick took part in the inspection. He
further testified that Dimmick counted
the cash, In order to report the contents
of the vault to the superintendent, j Cole
said Dlmmick's count always agreed with
his figures and that Dimmick never dis
covered any discrepancies up to June,
1901.
On cross-examination, 4 Cole described
how the cash was counted. .He said Dim
mick would count the money in the
pigeon-holes, -on the trucks and in other
portions of the vault. All the â¢ pigeon
holes, 400 in number, the witness said,
were .filled on July 25, 1900. The witness
stated that about the month of Septem
ber, 1500, sacks containing double eagles
were placed on trucks and on the floor
of the vault. He said the trucks partly
obscured some of the bags in the pigeon
holes. >Â¦' '"'Vi'*'..'
-â¢ "Did Dirnmick count the bags obscured by
the trucks?" a3ked Collins. ,
Dimmick did not move the trucks, but pro
ceeded on the assumption that the pigeonholes
were filled with sacks of cold. . .
. What tltM of the day was the eount Â»ade?
At the close of th<* dayâ at 3 o'clock.'
Was FltzDatrick. the watchman, present
derirr the count? >.
Â¦ Sometime* he would be present in the vault
or outside, close by.
Did you take a book into the vault?
Ye*,' sir. I took this book.
The witness passed his account book to
Attorney Collins, who. after examining
the entries, resumed the examination.
How was the money on trucks counted?
He would count the sacks one at a. time. '
-What iÂ« the normal capacity of that vault?
About $6,000,000. At one time it contained
$25,000,000. ,'

placed in the vault. The witness told of
the settlements at the end of each fiscal
year, and was turned over to the defen
dant's attorney for cross-examination.
"No questions," said Collins, and, much
to the surprise of counsel for the . Gov
ernment, Leach left the stand without
telling what he knows of the crime. At
torney Schlesinger thereupon informed
the court he would recall the superin
tendent later on in the trial. Judge Â£<z
Haven did not take kindly to this mole
of procedure and suggested to Schlesin
ger that he finish with his witness be
fore allowing him to retire. Schlesinger
replied that he had made careful prepara
tion of the case, and it was necessary to
recall a witness now and then In order
not to confuse the court and Jury.
I think $6,000,000â 1200 bags.
-DW you â¢: hear any conversation' between
IMmmick and Cole about withdrawing money
from the racks? " Â¦ ..Â» ,"
Â¦ Yes. I heard Dlmmiek say to: Cole, "You
should not move the sacks out of'the-pigeon

On the reconvening of court after re
cess. Judge de Haven announced that he
had reconsidered the motion made at the
morning session to exclude all witnesses
during the taking of testimonyA He said
it was a matter entirely in the discretion
of the court and that no exception could
be taken to the court's ruling. He there'
fore thought it proper after consideration
to have the witnesses Â¦ excluded.
The courtroom was nearly emptied
when the numerous witnesses left, in
obedience to the court's order.
Captain Fitzpatrick, "vault man" at the
Mint, testified that he had occupied that
position for six years. He told the num
ber of bags taken out of the vault on the
28th and 29th days of June, 1901, and
placed in the vault in the basement. He
said he was there during the transfer to
see. that the bags containing certain de
nominations were kept together, and that
each truck, was loaded with sixty -sacks.
He. said four men were in the vault at
one time loading the trucks. A man
named Donaldson was outside the vault
keeping tab for Cashier. Cole. Fitzpat
rick explained that each bag on the ea3t
side of the rack contained $5000 in double
eagles. He said It was his duty to watch
the vault, and he performed his duty as
best he could. When he was at lunch
he was relieved by Cashier Cole. Prose
cutor Schlesinger then proceeded to ques
tion the witness. .
. Was- there anything to prevent the' moving
of the trucks in the vault so that the bags In
the rack might be â¢ counted ?â¢

minv.tes.

eagles in that rack what did you discover?

said he followed the instructions, which
were given In the early part of January,
1901. He added that Captain Fitzpatrick
and Porter Butler were present when
these instructions were given. A recess
was taken until 2 o'clock.
THREE EMPLOYES OF THE UNITED STATES MINT AND THE DEFENDANT WHO IS BEING TRIED BEFORE
JUDGE DE HAVEN AND JURY FOR THE ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT OF SIX SACKS OF GOLD VALUED
AT $30,000.-,
~ Captain - Mossman knows where Haw
kins is and ; the ' other members of the
gang . are known to be in ' the mountains
bordering New \ Mexico and . Arizona. The
rangers are scattered over the country
wherever, the outlaws are expected to ap
pear and their arrest is expected at any
Wme. >It is believed that the -gang has
teen broken up completely and ( will never
again be heard of i in ; the Southwest iJ69wc
In an interview Captain Mossman said
that the rangers ' had , experienced great
difficulty in capturing outlaws, owing to
the disposition on the part of the settlers
in the Black River country to shield the
desperadoes,; which, they sav, they have
to do for. their own protection. The coun
try is rough and, ; there: are but few
ranches. .'Whenever, a strain is'-helrS up
by. bandits or a store Is robbed they head
forfthe Black River' country. It was
there that the fight with the, "Bill" Smith
gang of . cattle - rustlers took place a few
months ago,' in which' Maxwell and Tofla,
two Arizona rangers, were killed. .'.;
The* Black River country in Northeast
ern" Arizona, one of the wildest regions
in the territory, has been the hiding place
of this gang, and -"Bill" Hawkins and the
rest of bis men are now there. The Haw
kins gang- Is perhaps better known in
Arizona as the George Musgrave band of
Outlaws. Musgrave, alias "Bill" Haw-
Kins, has. made his headquarters here for
many years and was formerly a mem
ber of the notorio'us Black Jack crowd
that held up. the International bank at
Nogales in August, 1S96. Musgrave, then
no more than 20 years old, was one of
the most desperate men Black Jack had
with him, and in the fight v that took place
in Skeleton Canyon a few days after the
holdup, between the bandits and a posse,
Musgrave killed Frank Robson, a line
rider, Â¦ who was with the posse. To-day
Musgrave is regarded as one of. the hard
est bandits in the territory Â»to capture,
owing to the friends he has in the moun
tains of the Black and Blue -River, re
gions. Â¦ . >V
. But the gang is almost completely
broken up and the people of New Mex
ico and Arizona are rejoicing with Cap
tain Mossman and his rangers over what
is regarded as the cleverest trailing ever
done in the Southwest. The gang came
into Arizona a short time ago from. New
Mexico, where it held up a store and
killed a boy- at Fort Sumner. The mem
bers separated after dividing the bGoty
.and came, on different trails' into the
Black River country. Captain Mossman
and his rangers started in pursuit of the
outlaws and by clever trailing have thus
far captured Sam Bass, Wit Neil, George
Cook and Joe Roberts, each man having
been taken without a shot .being fired.
Bass was arrested a few days ago at the
O. L. D. ranch on Blue River by Pollard
Pearson, a ranger. The members of the
gang who are still at large are i"BJU"
Hawkins, Patrick - Murphy, "Kid" Isabel
and another man. ; -â¢ Â¦ - .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONROVIA. April ll.-The one-year
old son of James McAlonan of Lower
Duarte had a remarkable escape from
death this afternoon. The child was play
ing In the yard, in which Is an Irrigation
stand pipe. In some way it fell In and
was carried by the water through 400 feet
of. cement pipe underground.
The mother missed her baby and ran to
the exit, where the water flowed Into an
open ditch. Not seeing the little one. the
half-crazed woman returned to the stand
pipe. : Just then a Mexican . working on
the ditch saw the child forced out of the
pipe. With. _ rare presence, of mind he
caught the babe and commenced rolling
it on the ground to expel the water.
Breathing had practically ceased, but per

tion to resume. A doctor was summoned
from Monrovia and made the restoration
to life complete.
The accident occurred on what is known

When Detectives McNeill and Harrington

"The answer to Mr. Folk's telegram to
the Governor came to Four Courts at 2:30
in the morning in the form of a dispatch
from the Western Union office ct Jeffer

ing it might rontain a reprieve. Instead
it said that fne Governor had come to a
window and when told the nature of the
message had directed*it to be placed un-'
der the door and had shut the window
without sending an answer. I supposed
that ended i the matter and left no liopc.
Mr. ~ Folk, whom one of ' the newspaper
men called over the 'phone, thought the
same and so. did the prisoner. I den't
hold myself to blame. The Governor is
the one who had the authority, and he ia
responsible for the whole incident."
Deputy Sheriff Charles Bilhartz, who
received and opened the telegram con
taining the reprieve from the Governor,
says that the message was received twen
ty minutes after it had been filed in Jef

Union office on Eighth street and was de
livered by a messenger who had run thai
entire distance to the Four Courts. Cir

was turned over to the family.
"Without the desire to reflect on thÂ«
men who sent me to this fate, the worst
that can befall a mortal man, I want to
say that not only have I been prosecuted
but relentlessly persecuted as well. This

marks the final triumph of money over
justice. The time is past when anything
can be done. Death is very near to me.

would have been no fight, no shooting

The boy walked to the gallows with a
steady step, and when asked by the Sher
iff if he wished to say anything, began a
speech that occupied three minutes. Hs
declared that be tired the fatal shot, but
disavowed any intention of murder. His
object, he said, was merely to disarm his

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
Few people can understand tie feel-
ings of the pugilist as he is being- counted
oat. He hears the seconds ticked off.
He struggles to rise, but struggles in
vain. He has lost the fight.
There ere some who are making a
losing fight for life that can appreciate
this; those whose lungs are diseased.
With every tick of the watch, they know
that they are being counted out.
The great question is how can a quick
rally be made to continue tie fight
against disease? Many who have asked
that question have found a satisfactory
answer in the use of Dr. Piexce's Golden
Medical Discovery. It cures bronchitis,
obstinate,^ deep-seated - coughs, hemor-
rhage, night -sweats, emaciation, and
other conditions which if neglected or
unskilfully treated may find a fatal
termination in consumption.
"When I commenced taking:, Dr. Pierce**
Goldea Medical Discovery," write* Mr. John T.
Heed, of Jefferson, Jefferson Co.. Aric, Â«I was
very low with a cough, end would at times spit

bottle I took did me so much good that I had
:aith in it and continued nntil I had taken
twelve bottles. Now I do not look like nor feel
like the same man as* was a year ago. People
astonished and said they did not think I
could lire. I can thankmlly say that I am
entirely cared of a disease from which had it
cot been for your wonderful ' Discovery â¢ I would
have died." '
There are cures behind every claim

CEICKETEBS ARE t READ Y
FOR SEASON'S OPENING
It had been Intended to hold the first'
cricket practice of : the season on the
ground at Webster street, Alameda, last
Sunday, but the Inclemeat weather pre
vented it. There Will be a practice to
day, beginning at 10:30 o'clock in the
morning.
At the annual election at officers of the
Pacific Cricket Club the following were
chosen for the coming year: President
Captain John Metcalf e: vice presidents
W. Balnaves and J. H.'.Haruour; captain'
H. C. Casidy. At a special meeting held
since the annual meeting A. W: Wilding
302 tffUIfornla' street, was chosen secre
tary. -The members of the executive com
mittee are: Captain John Metcalf e W.
Bal naves, J. H. Harbour, -H. C. Caaidy
A. W. Wilding, George Theobald, J, - J.
Theobald and F. Bonnion. The selection
committee consists of H. C. Casidy. John
Myers and W. Petherick, and the ground
committee is composed of T. J. A. Tiedf>
mann and A. W. Wildine.
Death, change of residence and matri
mony have made Kerious Inroads into the
ranks of the local cricketers. William
Hendemon of the Pacific Cricket Club was
recently taken away by" death and J. J
Moriarlty of the Alameda Club, one of
the best batsmen on the coast, has re
moved to Los Angeles Tor his health.
Robert B. Hogue,. captain of the Alameda
Club for several years, lately returned to
New South Wales, while matrimony has
claimed John - Myers and H. C. Casidy.
The last named, however, will continue to
play the old English game.
Both the city teams will, be somewhat
weaker this season than last 5'ear as they
have not replaced .the good players they
have lost. As both Harold Richardson
and E. G. Sloman are booked to play fcr
the Santa Cruz eleven this season the sca
eidft club should go near winning premier
position, whicli it lost by only a small
margin in 1901. Secretaries of clubs who
have not already sent lists' of their mem
bers to the secretary of the California
Cricket Association are requested to do
so at once, to-morrow being the last day
allowed by the by-laws for sending in
the rolls.

that- it .is 'hardly to be expected the San

the yachts are being made ready
for the coming, season. . the " San

lected the 26th inst., and. the Co
rinthians-May 3, as their opening day?.
The California Yacht Club took, its first
cruise of the year last Sunday, but the
.weather was' Â§6 severe that, several of
the amateur tars were 'inclined to think
too early a date had been . chosen for
opening the season. ' George E. Miller's
sloop Occident, which was driven by ' the
storm against the-, Tiburon ferry, slip, . was
chafed considerably, though her crew
iised mattresses, coats, blankets and
everything available as fenders. It will
be necessary to 'replace two planks. ' E.
Bouquet's sloop Hope was driven on the
Berkeley mud flats. She suffered no seri
ous.damage. Dr. T. L. .Hill brought his
sloop Cygnus . down from Corte Madera
Creek, where she lay during the winter,
to Sausalito last Sunday afternoon, right
In the teeth of the southwester. :
Boatkeeper Lang .of the San Francisco
Yacht Club' had a hard chase after the

she at last got free- and was blown on the
mud In Kicnardson iBay.

of the club were chosen directors of the

necessary affidavits have - been made an
application will be filed for a certificate of
incorporation. , The California Yacht
Club wishes â¢ to -acquire an anchorage at
the mouth of San Antonio Estuary, near
the southerly v pier head of the narrow
gauge mole, to save the tedious, beat. out
of the creek and the long run home with
a light breeze at the end of a cruise.
In the heavy weather of last Sunday the
sloop Pactolus . had a large piece carried
away from her mainsail and her jib torn
so that a new suit of sails will be neces
sary. The flagship Thelraa lost a hatch
way overboard; â¢ and, after making sev
eral unsuccessful attempts to pick It up
in the rough water between Angel Isl
and . and the mouth of the creek, aban
doned it.
A SINGLE sculling race has been ar
ranged between A. TV. Pape and
Henry Peterson, and the former
has already begun training for
the event. Pape will be coached
by the old oarsman, Leander Stevenson.
There have been rumors for the past two
or three years that Pape would . became
a professional oarsman, as he has al
ready defeated all the local sklffmen and
shellmen, most of" them on several occa
sions. He has also beaten the Portland
single scullers on their own waters..
Members of*.the Ariel Rowing Club held
their regular monthly meeting: on Monday
night, at which it was decided to hold
another : boxing tournament next month
for the benefit of the building; fund. The
first tournament given under the man
agement of the club brought out some
spirited fighting, and was successful
financially.
It is proposed to make an effort to add
the names of fifty new members to the
roll, and with the view of encouraging
young men to apply for membership, the
initiation fee has been reduced from $5
to ?1 for the next sixty days.
K. J. Lynch has been appointed a com
mittee to confer with the directors of thfÂ»
South End Rowing Club and hopes to be
able to make arrangements whereby the
Ariel oarsmen may be permitted to use
the South End boathouse as training
quarters. II these arrangements are
made, the .barge crews of the Ariela will
at once begin practice for the Fourth of
July regatta.
The Olympic Boat Club members held
a meeting on Monday night, at which
Captain S. J. Pembroke was instructed
to prepare designs for a club uniform to
be considered . at a special meeting set
for the 21st inst. Captain Pembroke pro
poses to give points for places In a series
of regattas to be held during the present
year for five trophies that have been
presented to the club, the five members
making the highest number of points to
capture the prizes.. The first regatta will
be held early next month. . The officers
of the boat club will appear before the
directors of the Olympic Club at their
next meeting .and will Â¦ endeavor to get
them to permit an butrigged skiff to be
set up In the swimming tank so that
oarsmen may ' practice/ \ ; The board has
already decided adversely on this mat
ter, but it is hoped to induce the direc
tors to emulate. the Justices of the Su
preme Court by reversing their former
decision.
The Alameda Boat Club held its regu
lar meeting -on Tuesday night, at whicn
it was decided to issue Interest-paying
bonds to the members, the funds to be
expended in buying three pleasure yawls
and a new four-oared barge for the use
of the crews in the annual regatta.
The south wester last Sunday almost en
tirely put a stop to rowing from - the
South End boathouse. George" Wright
and D. Methmann pulled around the bat
tleship "Wisconsin, but shipped a great
deal of water in ââ¢ returning. Dr. C. C.
Dennis started out in a skiff, but after
proceeding a little way put back, Charles
Jenkins, : financial secretary and a most
active member of the South End Rowing
Club, will leave next month for a trip
to England, his old home. He will try to
arrange to meet the amateur ; - welter
weight wrestling champion of England.
If he does so, he will enter as a member
of the Olympic Club. F. L. Fenton and

11.â Alter the hard-fought baseball
game last Saturday, in which Cali

of the Stanford nine to hit Overall's
curves, the cardinal team has been work-
Ing faithfully with the h'ope of winning
the second game to-morrow. There ,has
been but. one game played during . t the
week, that with Santa Clara College on
Thursday, but the players have been put
ting in two hours daily in fast, snappy
practice, which promises to show .favor
ably In the game to-morrow.
Coach Swindells has had his colts de
vote most of their time to "stick" work.
He feels certain if they Improve In bat
ting that the second intercollegiate game
will be a cardinal victory. The tielding of
the Stanford players in last Saturdays
game was considered by most of the spec
tators to be of a higher order than Cali
fornia's.
There will be no change in the varsity
line-up to-morrow unless it be in the box.
Both Parker and McFarland have done
good, consistent work at this position
during the week. It is possible the for
mer may be given a ! chance to pitch
agairst the blue and gold nine, although
the work of McFarland last .Saturday was
satisfactory both to the coach and to the
rccters. The plucky game put up by the
varsity against California has raised the
hopes of the students here. It is. ex
pected a large contingent will go to
Berkeley ' to-morrow.
While there is practically no chance for
Stanford to win the intercollegiate field
meet. Trainer "Dad" Moulton is pleased
with the improvement shown by his men
during- the week. Dunn "04 and Smith '03
have both run the quarter in ' :51 2-3,
which will probably insure, eight points
for Stanford in that event.. Henley's.In

Both boys entered the ring at 112
pounds. Twice before they have mat
within the ropes and on both occasions
Hanlon came out victorious. Last night's'
battle was for glory 'and gore and tha
little fellows covered themselves with
both in their gritty struggle.
Hanlon was the. aggressor in nearly all
of the fifteen rounds, but Neil waa worth
Kim- from beginning to end, and, as the
gong sounded each three-minute limit, ho
was usually putting up a phenomenal
fight. -The recuperative power displayed
by* both boxers was marvelous.
Hanlon went right after his opponent :n
the flrst round and put Nell down with
rib-roasters,, but the latter exhibited littte
signs of .weakness as a result. He gave
as hard, as Jhe received. Neil planted two
terrific left swings on Hanlon' 3 jaw in the
second round,: which roused tne recipi
ent's ire. and he played a tattoo on Neil's
stomach. :
Hanlon took a great amount of punish
ment In-- the -third, but waa ready for
more. '. Neil . stopped many of Hanlon's
vicious uppercuts with his Jaw and head
in the fourth. Hanlon got a powerful
right on the Jaw In the fourth round,* but
before the bell he seemed to have Neil
going.
- The fifth was a hammer-and-tongs af
fair. Hanlon started the blood from
Neil's nose in the sixth. Both boys fought
each other to a standstill in the seventh
and eighth rounds. Hanlon fell outside
the ropes in the ninth. Both boxers were
tired In this round. Neil fought fiercely
in the tenth. Hanlon tried to put him
out, but could not. The eleventh and,
twelfth *were whirlwind affairs. Hanlon.
tried time and again to plant a- finishing
punch, but lacked the steam. The last
three rounds were hard ones, and when
the referee declared the mill a draw hl3
ruling was received favorably.
Dave Barry fought a great eight-round
draw with Harry Foley and "Cyclone"
Kelly won a four-round bout from Jack
Williams.
Manager Lavigne was congratulated
upon the success of the fights.

WASHINGTON, April 11.â The House
Committee on Agriculture, in order to
expedite the bills passed, decided to-day
to recommend the acceptance of the Sen
ate-amendments to- the oleomargarine
bill. The. opponents of the bill believe
there are parliamentary difficulties still
in the way of the final disposition of the
measure, notwithstanding to-day's action.
It is claimed that as the Senate amend
ments make changes in the revenues they
cannot be concurred In until the House
has considered them in committee of the
whole. This, it is claimed, will require a
special rule, and the opponents of the
bill claim to have ground for belief that
this special rule "will not be given.

The Davis cups doubles tournament, set
for last Sunday, will be played to-mor
row. The tournament committee will have
a hard question to solve when it comes to
arranging the handicaps. '. Whether the
Smith brothers will play Collier and
Crowell on even terms; and, if so.whether
they will be called .upon- to allow the
tame handicaps afe the latter, "are ques
tions that will materially affect the final
dispositions of. the trophies. -They -will
undoubtedly go to one of these teams,
with the odds slightly in favor of the
Smith brothers, | who have to win them
but once more, while Collier and Croweil
must win them twice.

Harry Vitatoe, the jockey, is In a peck
of trouble. Despairing of hearing from
Europe he signed to ride for Billy Randall
In Montana. Yesterday Vitatoe received
notice from one of the ' San Francisco
banks that a sum of money was â¢ on de
posit at his disposal. It is, to defray ex
penses to Russia, where a position at $8000
for the season awaits him. Now, Billy
Randall declines to release him. â¢ .

Track Notes.
W. O'B. Macdonough's brown filly Or
gandie, piloted by Lee Jacksdn, made a
runaway race of the two-year-old scram
ble. The Fog, first choice in the betting,
with Conley in the saddle, ran a true and
game race, losing by less . than-' two
lengths. The Forum and. Katanga fought
it out for the show, the former getting a
nose verdict. Â¦â¢ .
Practically neglected, not alone by the
betting public, but by her; stable as well,
The Hoodoo, with Ransch up, registered
a winner of the -third number a sprint
over the Futurity course. The. mare
passed Lief Prince at the three-sixteenths
pole and; stalling off the challenge of
Fridolin, a 30 to 1 shot, won by a head.
King Dellis, the favorite, finished third
once more, his old notch.
Marshal Neil, starting a 2 to 1 favorite,
did succeed in taking the closing mile and
a sixteenth selling affair. -When his case
seemed hopeless in the stretch, Jackson,
who had the mount, tried a flying wedge
through on the rail, which turned out suc
cessfully, for he disposed p of Lena with a
length or more to spare. Rcdwald lost
third place to Windward.
Mamie Hildretlr, ridden by See, Â¦ and 9
to 1 in the betting, beat Katie Walcott
handily. for the first race," a seven-furlong
selling event. McNamara, which closed
equal favorite with Katie Walcott, led to
the stretch, where he was all aut. Mamie
Hildreth then gradually worked her way
to the-front, scoring by a length. El Rey
was third. Â¦. .' . .
Among the many exciting finishes .of the
season that at the conclusion. of the six
furlong sprint,. fifth to be run,' when Di
vlna, Rubus, John Peters and Saul, of Tar
sus finished almost noses on the wire, will
be remembered as. one of the Â¦ prettiest.
The judges picked Divina, but they might
just as well have chosen Rubus ; or- John
Peters, so far as arguing' the point was
concerned. Divina was backed from. 7
down to 5, while Rubus was a 10 to 1 shot.
Jake Holtraan shot Â«Jie barrier up^ with
Tower of Candles, the 6 to 5- favorite, back
In the rear.. Her. chances/ of winning
would have been Just as rosy had she been
nibbling grass on the Infield. - At that,
Divina met with much bad racing luck,
and the mare, not Jockey See, earned the
victory.
Away back in the past Aloha II had the
reputation of being a '.'forty horse," but
none of his previous Â¦ California raced
would bear this statement out. Inasmuch
as he was ridden In the second seven-fur
long event by C. Bell, a maiden jockey, the
books took all sorts of liberties with the
gelding, some few laying CO to 1. Bell
made few mistakes, and when Wyoming,
grew tired In the stretch, took- the lead,
beating Our Lizzie, another despised one,
nearly a length.- The favorite, Wyoming,
ran third. . ' - / / â¢ . -.
ANOTHER bargain sale : of long
shots was largely attended yes
â¢ terday at Oakland track. ..-, Among
the cheap ones overlooked' by in-
J r >.*> tending purchasers were Mamie
Hildreth, 10 to 1: Organdie, -8 to .1; ' f he
Hoodoo, 12 to 1; Aloha II, GO to. -1, : and DI
vina, 7. to 1. Visitors . from afar did not
invest largely, the good things .'falling
chiefly into the hands of inside buyers.
Marshal NeiL closed the day's doings by
scoring at oÂ£ds of 2 to 1, affording tem
porary relief to the afflicted talent. The
fields .were large, the opportunities . to
make: money great and -the chances of
failure immeasurably . greater. .For the
past lew ; days .the bookmakers have been
reaping the reward of patience. ' . .', /â¢
RESULTS OF rFRIDAY'S^ RACING AT- OAKLAND^TRACK;
Boxers Go Six Fast Bounds Before
a Philadelphia Club.
PHILADELPHIA, April 11.âPhiladel
phia'Jack O'Brien and Joe Walcott fought
six fast rounds at the Industrial Athletic
Club to-night before a . crowded house.
So evenly matched were the men that the
spectators were divided as to which of
the lighters had the better of "the go. A
majority of- them seerrieo to think that
the honors belonged to O'Brien. Through
out the light the English champion fought
on the defensive, although at times he
went viciously after the negro, but never
forced him to break ground. O'Brien used
his left on Walcotfs face and his right
on the stomach, but did not appear to dis
tress the colored man. In the second
round Walcott sent in two hot -right hand
punches on O'Brien's, wind, which
knocked the steam out of the . Philadel
phlan. He was tired at the end of the
round, but after that he came back and
fought well. Neither man was much dis
tressed at the end of the sixth . round,
but O'Brien showed. more evidence that
he had been in a warm battle than did
his colored opponent. Walcott leaves,to
morrow for San Francisco to fight George
Gardner. .. Â¦/....

The unlucky thirteenth opened with the
Senitors leady to compromise. Reb
samen drew a pass and went up one on
Mike Birmingham's single. Frary flew
out to Whalen and Wagner forced Big
Mike at second, while Rebsamen scooted
toward third. Charley Graham was noti
fied if he did. not make a hit -he would be
shy a job. Charley likes work, so when
Chimmie passed him one which looked
good he fell on It for two sacks. Reb
farren and Wagner arrived and the
trouble was over.
It was give and take from the eighth
until the thirteenth. Both pitchers were
effective and steady, the umpire was
pleasant and the crowd sent In its orders
for supper. Fisher's face was a dream
for a student in human nature. It was as
changeable as the odds in a betting ring
and reflected his feelings like a mirror.
The fireworks began to shoot upward In
the eighth.* Doyle pulled down Nordyke's
hard arive with one hand and heard sev
eral girls say "Isn't he a dear." Holly
took four bad ones, but Shugart forced
him at the second pillow. Lahey followed
HolJy's lead and with two gone and as
many on the sacks Delmas hit a pop fly
bacK. of short. Unglaub was under it,
but Wasner butted in. The ball was
dropped in the mix-up, allowing Shugart
to tear around to the plate. Little Chim
mie tcok oft' his coat, swung viciously at
something, hit the ball bafely to right and
Lahey and Delmas crossed the rubber,
tying the score.
The Senators owned the game until
Unglaub dropped a lly in short left lieid,
which made wisher groan. They openea
hostilities by sending Tommy Sheehan
over the route on two clean hits In the
third. In the fifth they shone again. Gra
ham walked, but Sheehan forced him at
second. Tommy immediately landed on
Lnglaub's two sack biff to the center gar
den. It was Sacramento again when the
seventh rolled around. Graham again
drew a walking card, was sacrificed to the
middle station by Hickey and took his
seat on the bench when Kebsamen singled
over Bone's head.
Harris felt sore. He could not under
stand why his team, should lose when
c'himmie Whalen actually got two hits.
Chimmie was the whole snow on the local
bench. He chewed gum and took his coat
off twice when he faced the pitcher. His
first wallop brought two men home and
the eecona one startled Mike Fisher to
such a degree that he fell off the bench.
The rest of the local stickers could not
distinguish what Hickey was handing
them. Some times it tooK the form of a
goid brick and again it resembled a bal
loon. All locked alike to the locals.
It was a great game. The rival man
agers sat opposite each other j on the
benches, smoned ropes and sent wireless
messages flitting across the diamond.
Fishers glares were the more deadly.
They frightened the local men so badly
they could not see the ball when the last
round came along.
The game extended itself until It
reached the thlrteen-innlng mark, and
then. when Umpire Jack O'Connell
ordered lights to be placed at all the bases
and on top of the flagpole, victory got
tired of waiting and landed with a bump
in the midst of the Fisher headquarters.

In addition to the demand of the Nationalists for
home rule, the perennial fight of the Irish radicals,
there has arisen another issue which brings the
Unionists of Ireland into harmony with the radicals
and makes a virtually united Ireland. The new issue
is new in form only. Practically it is the old land
question, the issue between landlord and tenant, in a
new phase and with a more radical demand.
Whether the Irish will ever be united in a demand for
home rule may be questioned, but it is certain they
are virtually united now in a demand for peasant
proprietorship.
T. W. Russell, who has always opposed home rule,,
but is an active leader in the fight for a compulsory
sale of land to small occupiers, recently, pointed out
how beneficial the* land purchase act has proven
when put into operation, and how the .success at
tained in one locality has given rise to a demand
for its universal application. As an illustration he
cites the purchase of the Lord Dillon estate and says:
"The estate is occupied by some 4000 tenants. These
are in the main small holdings of mere bits of bog
reclaimed by. the tenants. .For this property. Lord
Dillon received Â£294,090, and, after his Lordship's
exit, the Congested Districts Board resold ' to. the
occupiers. What was the result of this operation?
This: That the tenants who paid Â£1 as annual rent to
Lord Dillon now. pay 13s 4'd to. the state as a termin
able annuity. Arrears to the amount of Â£20,000 were
wiped out. Landlord, agent, bailiff, rent office, all
disappeared. For these poor people it was a new
heaven and a new earth. But it is at this point that
the real pinch comes. Did the members of the board
consider what they were doing? - This was not, a case
of Lord Dillon selling to his tenants under the pur
chase acts. If his' Lordship had. chosen to make a
present of his estate to' the people living upon it
nothing could have been- said. . Lord Dillon sold to
the Government, a wholly different thing; The.Gov
ernment resold to the, tenants. It thus became a
great act of state policy. Did the Government ever
stop to think what the effect would be on the tenants
of the neighboring properties, who were denied these
great privileges? The result.- at all eVents. has been
a strike on these estates for the same terms, for what"
is called 'the Dillon rent'. Even the Attorney Gen
eral for Ireland admitted the othernight that the ac
tion of these unlettered peasants was .'natural' " >
While the contest for peasant proprietorship is-
DESPITE the clamor of applause with which
the hopeful Liberals of Great Britain *wel
comed Lord Rosebery back to the field of
political activity, it appears that for all practical pur
poses he might as well have stayed in- retirement.
His proposal to wipe the Irish question off the slate
roused something of enthusiasm at first, but events
have proven that the policy cannot be carried out.
Jrish questions were never more pressing upon the
kingdom than at this time, and no statesman can dis
miss them nor compromise them. â¢ >
IRISH LAND PURCHASE.
On the top 'of- all those futilities^the recent failure
to agree, upon the .; Cuban question comes as some
thing of a climax.' The issue affords a most excellent
opportunity for the Democratic Iparty. to make' an
effective attack upon the party, in power. . Cuban re
ciprocity opens up the tariff question, weakens the
protective, system and offers aVchance for involving
Republicans in a dangerous dilemma: So plain, is the
opening madefor such. an attack that even Republi
cans^ themselves admit it, and over and over again
attention- has been directed to it /by, some of the
foremost Republican papers in all sections of the
Union. In spite of all that, ' however/Democracy,
has-been unable to land a'bldw.- Not even when the
foe is so exposed can the \ demoralized opposition '
unite for.- attack.* . .
â¢ The utter collapse' of every attempt to define a"
party policy is the more notable because, when the
session began .it was announced "with a great flourish
of trumpets that the Democratic leaders in Congress
intended : to "do big politics" -during the !winter Â¦ for
the purpose of. giving their :partya;programme and
an issue _upon..which; to appeal; to*the country in the
Congressional elections -this -fall. '; -Conferences 'â¢ of
leading Â¦Democrats; were held, in Boston, ''Â¦Â¦New York
arid Â¦.Chicago j to help j put the plan.' The result is be
fore, thecountry.'., Up'on not , a^single important issue 1
of the. time is the Â¦Democratic party in- : Congress
united, except 'upon a resolution to fight any attempt
to investigate; the extent to which the suffrage laws
of s'everaUof the Southern States violate the constitu-.
tion. Here is the , real /Bourbonism- manifest and'
conspicuous". ; iJet it V be : a - question- of doing some :
wrong to'- the negro and Democracy' is harmonious
but; let. it 'be any other question and, Democracy, is
. If that were: the only occasion of the kind it would
merit no special attention, but it happens that-it fol
lows a long series;-of Democratic caucuses called for
the. purpose of defining; a policy "for the party and
ending in nothing.; Immediately 'after Congress as-r
sembled a Democratic caucus was summoned to ar
range of action for the session, but after
prolonged wrangling it adjourned- until after the
holidays. . When it met again the results were no
better. All effort 'to formulate V general policy was
then; abandoned, ; but from "time ,to time attempts
have, been made to bring about agreement on par
ticular.'issues. Only upon the issue of opposing in
vestigation of the.- suppression ; of the negro vote in
the South could agreement be reached. It required
months, in fact, to elect a chairman of the Congres
sional campaign corhrhitteej and in the end one fac
tion was given the chairmanship, j while another fac
tion, took the "executive committee. '{ " Â¦
DISPATCHES from Washington announce
that the Democratic members of the '- House
of Representatives held a caucus to decide
upon a party/policy with respect to the Cuban' re
ciprocity bill, but after discussing it for three hours
theyilaid on. the table every resolution offered and
adjourned without taking action, leaving every mem
ber to vote as he pleased.
ANOTHER FIASCO.
South Dakota is not the only State that is being
enriched by the new migration.. The whole of the
Northwest is sharing in it. Railroads running into
Montana report a heavy immigration traffic, and it
is estimated that. more than 100,000 people will make
homes for themselves in that section of the Union
during the present year.
. While that immense migration of home-seekers is
going to the cold, blizzard-swept plains and moun
tains of the Dakotas and Montana, our- sister coun
ties south of the Tehachapi have been overrun and
almost overwhelmed by the throngs of tourists that
crowded there for the enjoyment of winter sunshine.
Northern California, then, is between two great lines
of travel. She has as fine inducements for pleasure
seekers as can be fotind any where, in Southern Cali
fornia, and far better advantages to offer Home
seekers than any of the States of the Northwest.
Here. then, is the opportunity for profitably advertis
ing the resources of. this section of the State. The
coin should be promptly forthcoming.
In commenting upon the migration to South Da
kota the Springfield Republican says: "Not since
the early '80s, it is said, has there been such an im
migration movement into the State, and the singu
lar fact about the present immigration is that it is
composed largely of substantial farmers from Il
linois, Iowa and adjoining States in the Mississippi
Valley. Reports from various parts of the State tell
of the arrival of long immigrant trains carrying whole
families, with farm utensils and machinery and
household effects. Transfers of real estate are so
numerous as to attract general attention, and at very
substantial advances in price over figures ruling even
a year ago. Lands that sold at $10 to $25 an acre two
years ago are now commanding $25 to $50 and more.
At one place, it is stated, twenty-one cars of immi
grants have been unloaded since the beginning of the
year; at another three cars were unloaded in one
<lay; and so on down through a long list of towns,
with the land transfer offices all busy and prices rising
as in a new city during the height of a boom."
Outside the State conditions are as favorable as
those within. Our Eastern exchanges note that the
people of that section are stirring with a renewed
migratory movement. An impulse as widespread and
as potent as that which in former years moved thou
sands of thrifty and energetic men and women to
leave the older States and seek homes in Nebraska
and Kansas is once more felt in New England, the
Middle States and the States of the Mississippi Val
ley. At the present time the migration is mainly
toward the Dakota?, but it can be brought westward
to California if we try, and the promotion commit
tee intends to try.
All the circumstances of the time are propitious to
the work that has been undertaken. Nothing of en
ergy or of money will have to be expended in con
ducting a campaign of education at home. The peo
ple of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Valley
and of the coast and the mountain counties are al
ready aroused to the importance of the movement.
They are ready to co-operate and assist In each
county there are many progressive men already in
the field eager to urge on the work and to contribute
to it time, tin and talent. The directors of the move
ment have only to appeal to a sentiment 'already
formed. They have, in short, about everything that
h needed for success except the money. When that
is guaranteed the enterprise will move along the
whole line and begin to show results. #
A CANVASS of the city is now under way to
obtain revenues needed by the promotion com
mittee to carry out the enterprise of develop
ing the resources and advancing the industries of
Northern California. It is not necessary to remind
a community of business men that without ample
revenues there can be no reasonable expectation of
good returns from the work. Upon the response
made to the appeal for contributions therefore de
pends the success of all that has thus far been ac
complished in the enterprise. It is to be hoped the
subscriptions will be liberal and prompt.

At the time" the call for the convention was being
circulated it Avas x announced that the main purpose
of the gathering Avas to bring pressure to bear ' to
procure a greater reduction of; the tariff; on ; Cuban
sugar and 'tobacco.jhan that proposed by Congress,
and to'urge the Senate to^adopt. the other reciprocity
treaties now before that body. . Such aims will not
be' attained. 'It is as certain as anything in-politics
can be that the reciprocity treaties- are [ dead.' The
league, however, can do j a . great deal of ; mischief, for
it can increase; the activity of ' League
and.precjpitate- another figHt upon.the^protectiye.sys
tenv and thus disturb industry; and check enterprise
again asjin.the past. In short; the* manufacturers who
have organized the league are playing with fire, and
unless they are careful they will .themselves be badly
burned before they get through with it.
. These manufacturers are doubtless quite- sincere in
the desire that the. .Government; should make treaties
in the interest of their trade, but . they have not
stopped to think of. what will 'come should the Gov
ernm|nt undertake^anyjsuch thing. .The free traders
haA'e by no means given up the fight against, protec
tion, and the Democratic, party, eager for an issue,
is even now ready to assist them in their demands for
a sweeping, tariff reduction. -Should the Reciprocity
League once get the protective system so broken that
it; will no longer cpmmand or deserve the support
of the majority'of the: American people, they Avould
find some day that - their interests were /sacrificed
along with the rest. ' "
The report of the proceedings of the conA-ention at
which the league .^as) organized quotes the leaders
as saying, they are; manufacturing in excess of the
home/market, and goes oh to say: "They Avant the
United .States Government .to 'trade rela
tions with other countries that will throw open the
markets of the world for the,disposal of their goods
The United States Senate will, be' asked to, ratify at
least nine treaties that vpro vide J f or reciprocal arrarige
ments in the relationship of the United States
and various countries of the" Eastern Hemisphere." '
The cause for wnich -the league is to work is that
of substituting reciprocity, treaties instead of protec
tion as the fiscal policy' of the, United States/'; In
other Avprds, the league 1 proposes. that our tariff du-.
ties shall be fixed , by >arrangement with foreign
powers", instead of by bur own Congress. 'Protection
as a comprehensive" system embracing all American
industries is to be set aside and in place of it some
industries are to be sacrificed in order that others
may' be benefited. 1 . ;. y ; - > ' .
REPRESENTATIVES of: .sixty manufacturing
6rganizatior|s" liave met at Xhicago and or
ganized a Reciprocity League/',
with ; W. F. Stanley-, of . Kansas â¢ as president. : It is
claimed that the organization is to ' be non-partisan,
but as it aims at breaking down the protective sys
tem it is. hot easy to see how the:; claim can' be made
good. ; , Certainly no man 1 who stands upon' the Re
publican platform can afford to co-operate with the
league or .give support to its campaign. â¢ \.

The Call-Have you noticed that
Golden Gate Park Is bounded on all sides
by a street, excepting tor two blocks Â« n
the south side between Stanyan street and
First avenue? H street shoulcl*be-Â«on
tinued along the south line or 'the park
through blocks Noa. 713 and 714 to Stan
yan street, where It would run Into Fred
erick street. If you will -refer, t<> the
map Issued by "Crocker-Langley Direct
ory" for 1S98 and 1900 (arid perhaps other
dates),' you will find H street is. Jafd out
as I suggest .above. However, the^'Olock
book" recently published does ;Â¦' not show
any street there. If this street was 'ijperted
through those two blocks ,thei>. Frederick
street-would be a continuous street, sim
ilar to Fulton, Geary and California
streets. Â»
As the fourteen blocks' recently*' sold by
the Sutro estate are to be graded now
would be a good time to open H street
as above and close Frederick street ba
tween blocks 713 and 741. also- between
blocks 714 . and 740, and get rid of tbÂ«
"jogs" at First avenue. - - y
If you interview the owners of r^ii

Many Delegations Are Coming From Southern California.
Additional List of Representatives.
The needs of the Police Department are, in fact,
imperative. Crime :s altogether too frequent in the
city, and tends to increase rather than to diminish.
Nothing in the way of improvement can be expected
by adding to the work of the present members;; of the
force, for the force is already overworked by long
beats and long hours. The one remedy is an increase
of the force. How large the increase should be is
a matter for the consideration of experts. Careful es
timates on that point should be obtained from the
officers whose experience has made them familiar
with the problem, and to the estimates the Super
visors should give due heed.' The issue is one of- the
most important to-be considered in making up the
tax levy. The people desire economy in all things, but
intelligent men know there is no economy in over
working a small police force and leaving the public
exposed to depredations of all kinds from burglary to
highway robbery, frequently attended by assault and
sometimes by murder.
In addition to the general increase of the 'force
there is needed an efficient water patrol. ' A large
amount of property in this city fronts on the water
and is assailable from that side. Such property can
not be protected by a patrol that Watches only from
the streets. Of late there have been several cases of
robbery committed by. thieves who approached from
the bay and by rowing under the wharves were able
to operate with impunity, being completely out of
sight of any one on the streets. The need of a water
patrol indeed so urgent it is a matter of surprise
that it has not been supplied long ago." If appears,
however, that while recommendations for such a
patrol have been repeatedly made, no appropriation
has ever been given for the purchase of the necessary
boats. It is time to put a stop. to such false eco
nomy. The losses of San " Francisco every year J by
water thieves are too large to be any longer borne
without making a well directed effort to put a stop
to them, and such effort* can be made only by the es
tablishment of a fully equipped water patrol.
The increase in the population of the city, and the
increase in the number of criminals who make their
headquarters here, or who come here from other
cities to ply their trade, has not been accompanied by
a proportionate increase in the number of policemen.
The result has been that in many cases the men are
overworked, the beats are too long, and the service
generally is unequal to the task required of.it. This
fact is welUoiown to the criminals of the country, and
as a consequence many of them come to San Fran
cisco because they believe they will be less closely
watched here than they would be in other cities.
The inadequacy of the force is. due to no lack of
efficiency on the part of the officers nor of the rank
and file. On the contrary, the.personnel of the force
is one of which the community may be justly" proud.
The men are working long hours of duty and some
of them p.re covering very long patrols- Again and
again they have proven their fidelity and their court

from crime. There is therefore nothing, to justify co

In case : of contemplated shipment of muni
tions of war for the revolutionary party in
Colombia, as you mention, communicate with
the. United States Attorney and take all proper
measures to prevent or punish violations of
the neutrality laws I or the navigation laws of
the United States. The Consul making the
complaint should furnish special information,
and the department will communicate with the
Department of State and Attorney General con
cerning the matter.
Chief Clerk Cress Unger said vyesterday
that he had not been able tot discover
any United States law prohibiting 'the ex
portation of munitions of war, but he had
found a statute which required a bond of
double | the value of. the vessel and her
cargo to be given where a vessel equipped
for war purposes and considerable of her
cargo being. war material was about to
leave a port of the United States. The
statute refers only to a vessel fitted for
war purposes. Unger is of the opinion
that the subject comes under interna
tional law. . -

"Amberes, Belglca," on the steamship
Livland to New Orleans and thence to

to"' the address of the revolutionary party

THE United States army transport j
Hancock, which is reported ashore
In the mud on the beach, about 100
miles north of Manila, left here
March 15 for Manila. A dispatch
setting forth the facts given was pub
lished In The Call's dispatches yesterday
from Manila. It was stated in the dis
patch that Â¦> tugs had been 6ent to the
transport's assistance and that It was
thought likely she would be floated with
out much difficulty.
The Hancock carried a very heavy car
go from this port and when she left was
drawing nearly twenty-seven feet, of
water. She had on board the" headquar
ters band and two battalions of the Tenth
Infantry, 150 marines, 21 members of the
Red Cross corps and 375 recruits and
casuals. Colonel L. H. Lincoln was
the ranking army officer aboard and Cap
tain Wlllson was In command of the
transport. Among the cabin passengers
were many wives and children of army
men and about BlXty army and marine
officers. The Hancock, formerly the
Arizona, was the first of the ocean grey
hounds on the transatlantic run and is
considered the handsomest and most use
ful of all Uncle Sam's troopers.
Major Deval, the general superinten
dent of the transport service at this port,
says that the Government advices report
the Hancock ashore on a reef off Point
Patiaug, ninety miles north of Manila.
The Navy Department, he says, is ren
dering assistance. The greatest danger
would be from monsoons, but as the reef
upon which the trooper is spitted is with
in two miles of the shore and protected
by high coast mountains. Major Deval
thinks the Hancock safe enough In that
respect.

SCIENCE SCOBES AGAIN. V
A Preparation That Will Destroy the
Dandruff Germ Discovert
Finally the scientific student has dis-
covered a certain remedy for dandruff.
When it first became < known that dan-
druff is. the result of a germ, or parasite
that digs Into the scalp and saps the, vi-
tality of hair at the root, causing falling
hair arid baldness, biologists set to work
to discover some preparation that will
kill the /germ. 1 After a year's labor.- In
one laboratory, the germ, de-
stroyer was discovered, and it is now! em-
bodied in I Newbro's ; Herpiclde, which be-
sides curing baldness and thinning; hair,"
speedily and permanently, eradicates dan-
druff. "Destroy tne cause, you remove

Webster says that It now becomes neces
sary to return the, written charges made
by Miss McKinney against Lyser to the
Board of Education, to whom they were
addressed. Under a recent decision of
Judge Seawell the board may try accused
teachers without the intervention of the
Superintendent of Schools, even should
he .report that he Is .unable to discover
corroborative evidence. . Webster thinks
that it is the duty of the board to give
Miss McKinney an opportunity to prove
her charges and a chance to Lyser to dis
prove them. In fact the latter some time
ago requested that the trial be held with
out waiting. for Superintendent Webster's
findings In the case.
It is not a. settled matter that Principal
Albert Lyser of the John Swett . School
will escape, triaf by. the Board of Educa
tion on . charges preferred by Miss Mary
McKinney, a teacher 'in the same -school.
Superintendent of Schools Webster stated
yesterday that he had been misquoted In
a statement that he had recommended to
the board that the charges against Lyser
be dropped. -..
What . Webster did tell the board was
that two witnesses who had voluntarily
agreed to corroborate Miss McKlnney's
charge that Lyser had said that she was
a nrevarlcatbr and' insane had wilted
when the supreme moment of swearing
came and declined to make affidavits.

An objection was filed yesterday to the
confirmation of the sale of the estate of
Joseph - P.' Hale when the matter came
up ; in Judge "Â¦ Coff ey's court. 'The objec
tion was '_ made by Attorney Theodore
Roche, who in the absence of Attorney
Matt : I. , Sullivan represented Ann Feeney
Wright, -. one of the heirs. Roche asked
for a continuance on the ground. that Sul
livan, Mrs. Wright's attorney, was un
avoidably absent and that therefore the
sale should not be confirmed. â¢
Koche claims that the prices ' the prop
erty brought at a sale ordered by the
court seven years ago are not commen
surate with the "vaiue of the property
and intimated that collusion existed be
tween Mrs. Anals Ha.e, administratrix of
the . estate, Â¦ and' the purcnasers. His mo
tion was supported Dy W. W. Cameron,
who announced that He was prepared to
bid $1200 for'a piece of property wnicir
would bring only $200 If tne original safe
was'confirmed. Several other oids were
made, which, If accepted, would cause a
decided Increase In tne assets of the es
tate. Â¦ . ,
ltoche; filed an affidavit In which he
averreu tnat certain tide lands in this
city owned by the estate were sold to
Adam and Joseph Grant for a ridiculously
low sum, and averred turther that a sec
tion of the Hale ranch in Santa Clara
County was sold to J. T. Burke for $1100,,
while it is worth $2284. Roche also claims
that the Grants at â¢ the disputed sale
bought several sections of the wale ranch
for $11,449 79, which should not be sold for
less than $32,740.
The matter will be heard again to-day
at 2 p. m. . â¢.

the matter by the committee was. post
poned for one week, v
Sheriff Lackmann informed the com
mittee that the site of the present jail
was far too small on which to erect a

Of T le Woman's Catholic. Order of
Forresters, Chicago,
St. Frar.cis Xavier Court No, 174, Endorses Lydia E.
Pinkliani's Vegetable Compound.
Some women are tireless in their home work, others in their work in the
church or their favorite society or club ; they laugh and sing and are happy.
But think of the poor one who is left at home, utterly unable to make any
effort whatever, broken hearted and despondent. ,
The horror of female Complaints is upon her ; she is oppressed by that
distressing bearing-down feeling, backache, her nerves are all gone, don't care
to move and wants only to be left alone.

why the doctor had been so assiduous to
secure the statement, but the medical
man fully cleared himself from any
undue interest. He had realized the con
dition of O'Connor, and in the knowledge
that if a crime had been committed the
statement would be valuable, the doctor
prepared it. ., . Â¦.
George Walsh repeated his testimony
as given before the Coroner touching the
circumstances of the shooting. The wit
ness was followed by Guard James P
Walsh.
"I saw Devine and the other witness
Walsh, talking opposite Glblin's saloon'"
testified the guard. "Devine had a pistol
in' his hand and an overcoat over his
arm. He looked like a wild man so I
went up to him, saying: ,. ', . .
. Devine Betrays "No-Coneertir"~;~
The prisoner sat "calmly and Impassive
during the hearing. His strong, clearly
cut features betrayed no concern. He
spoke seldom and only when questioned
by his attorneys. His appearance was
quite in contrast with that of the day he
did O'Connor to death, as described by
James F. Walsh, the racetrack guard
who arrested him.
OAKLAND, April 11.â Thomas Do
vine, the slayer of John J. O'Con
nor, at Shell Mound, on March
31, was to-day held for trial be
fore the Superior - Court on a
charge of murder, the preliminary exam
ination being held before Justice James
G. Quinn.
Devine was attended during the hear
ing by his attorneys, M. C Chapman, F.
C. Clift and W. H. Jordan of San Fran
cisco. None of the . accused murderer's
family was present. In an ante-chamber
of the courtroom sat Mrs. -O'Connor, the
widow, surrounded by several of her
children, all garbed in deepest black.
District Attorney John J. Allen con
ducted the prosecution and with him was
associated' Attorney \V. J. Donovan. '
Dr. John W. Robertson of Llvermore,
an alienist who has been called by the de
fense as an expert /on mental diseases,
was a close observer .. of Devine during
the proceedings. Another insanity expert,
Dr. A. JS1. Gardner, for many years
superintendent at the Napa State Hos
pital, and Dr. J. P. Dunn were also at-'
tentive visitors in court in the interests
of the prosecution. The- question of De
vine's sanity is the keynote of the case.
Arnold was a fine looking man of about
35 years. He had the appearance of a
well-to-do business man. He was 5 feet
8 Inches tall, weighed about 160 pounds
and was of light Â¦ complexion, with blond
hair and mustache.
In the suicide's pocket was a letter ad
dressed to the Coroner. It asked that his
body be decently burled and not muti
lated. It said that the writer had de
posited $250 in the St. James Hotel to pay
funeral expenses.

SA*N BERNARDINO, April 11.â While
nearly a dozen officers were standing idly
by, John Bruce, the Indian held for the
murder of a young Indian girl, walked
calmly out of the courtroom In Hesperia,
a small town' on the desert north of this
place, to which he had been taken for a
preliminary hearing. He escaped with
out a single hand being raised to stop
him. A large posse is now in pursuit.
Three or four days ago Bruce strangled
a young Indian girl, against whose fam
ily he fancied he had a grievance, mak
ing his escape to the desert mountains
before the officers were notified of tho
murder. He wa3 heavily armed and pre
pared to make a fight for hl3 life. Near
ly a score of officers were sent after him
and yesterday morning they succeeded in
capturing him. He was at once taken
to Hesperia and. his preliminary trial
held there this morning, the Justice of
the Peace holding him for trial without
bonds.
While the Constable went tow the rail
way station to make necessary arrange
ments for bringing, the prisoner to the
County Jail in this city, others of the
posse remained with the prisoner In the
courtroom, discussing the case. So ab
sorbed were they that they did not notice
the Indian walk quietly to the door,
mount a -horse there and gallop
off. â¢ As he rode> out of town he was seen,

As the matter now stands the railroad
has been granted a franchise only over
part of the right of way through the
town of Emeryville. In Oakland, the
road's application has been "hung up"
because of error in publishing the notice
of the application.
This 'situation seriously . complicates the
efforts which" have been made toward se
curing ah entrance through Berkeley and
Emeryville and into Oakland of a aew
transcontinental railroad. The condition
arises from the demand of the Berkeley
Trustees that the coneee town shall be
assured of a regular service by the new
road.- , : Wh n thl3 â¢ matter was first
broached two phases were put on It. One
was- that the rallroa^ company should
give a bond of $50,000 to establish the de
pot and to stop trains at Berkeley, the
other was that the requirements should
be made a part of the franchise. The
matter was referred to a committee, com
posed of Trustees Thomas Rickard, E. Q.
Turner and W. H. Marston and Town At
1 orney B. A; . Hayne. That committee re
ported -to-night to the Board- of Trustees
in committee of the whole. The report
declared that while the committee fav
ored a clause in the, franchise, it was of
th 3 opinion that it was unwise to Insist
upon.it, and therefore recommended that
a bond be exacted . in lieu foe the per
formance of the Trustees' requirement.
Trustee Hoff led the opposition to the
-bond plan, insisting that the franchise
should cover the demand.* After much
debate, .President W. H. Marston put
the question whether it should be fran
chise or bond. The vote to Insert In the
franchise was unanimous, except for Trus
te- Ryder, who was excuseJ from voting.
At tfie last meeting of the board Captain
A. H. Payson, representing the Santa Fe
Railroad, objected to the franchise re
quirement, but declared -the . railroad
would willingly give a sufficient bond to
carry out the board'3 desires concerning
the depot. â¢
The officials of the Santa Fe Railroad have
informed me that unless they can . secure this
franchise clean and free from requirements
they will bide their time about putting through
the road. It is quite probable that they will
not accept the franchise. I will say nothing
further, at this time but that In all probabil
ity we will withdraw our application.
; BERKELEY, April lL-In all probabil
ity the Oakland and East Side railroad
will withdraw its application for a fran
chise . over the Calif ornia and Nevada
railroad's right of way, because the Town
Trustees to-night refused to grant the
franchise clear - of conditions. - Such was
the statement before the board by Attor
ney A. E. Bolton, representing the com
pany. It followed the vote of the Trus
tees to insert in the franchise a clause
requiring tho railroad to establish and
maintain a depot at Berkeley and to give
a direct passenge â¢ and Â¦ freight service.
The lawyer said: , ,-
Mr. Samuels asked if George E. da
Golla. representing the plaintiff, could bo
considered as an associate of the District
Attorney in the case, but Attorney Fitz
gerald replied that there was plenty of
time for that later.
Mr. Samuels Informed â¢ Judge Melvln
and the attorneys that as the ca3e cams
as a surprise his office had had no time
to consider the questions involved and ha
wanted a continuance in order to confer
with his chief. To this Judge Melvln re
plied that he had decided to invite the
other four Judges to sit with him, as th j
case was one of great importance. After
a conference with the attorneys he then
fixed April 19 as the day for hearing tho
evidence.
The attorneys for both sides then trans
ferred themselves and books to Judge
Melvin's court, where Deputy District
Attorney Samuels was called in to repre
sent the District Attorney's office, having
been notified that the Dalton case had
been turned over to the criminal depart
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, April 1L
Five Judges of the Superior Court, sit
ting in bank, with the District Attorney
to prosecute, will try Henry P. Dalton
on the charge of malfeasance that has
been brought against him by James E.
Crane to oust him from the oOlce of
County Assessor. That much was decid
ed to-day after the smoke from the first
legal skirmish in the impending battld
had cleared away.
The case came up for trial in Judgo
Hall's court this morning. It had been
assigned to his department while he was
away last week, but after looking hur
riedly over the papers to-day he declared
that it was purely a case for the criminal
department to hear. He therefore trans
ferred the case to Judge Melvin's court,
where all criminal trials are held.
There is considerable excitement in the
British sugar trade to know whether thÂ»
United States will regard the bestowal of
a lump sum on tfie West Indies as being
In the light of a subsidy and will retaliate
bj .imposing a countervailing, duty on
West Indian sugars. If such be the case
tt is pointed out, pecuniary relief by the
Imperial Government will accomplish
nothing:.
Nevertheless countless rumors regard
ing the budget provisions continue to cir
culate. A tax probably will be imposed
on flour, while it is possible that some
sort of tax will be placed on wheat. The
oil tijide anticipates a duty on petroleum,
but this is an intelligent surmise,
as the budget proposals are guarded with
zealous secrecy in order to avoid the Ios3
of revenue which' occurred owing to busi
ness interests taking advantage of the
premature leakage of the ' last budget's
proposals. Â¦ . Â¦
After much consultation the Cabinet ap
pears to favor giving the West Indies a
lump sum to be divided among the plan
tations in order to tide . over the period
between now and -when the Brussels con
ference* agreement comes into force. The
Colonial Secretary advocated a prefer
ential treatment of West Indian sugar
but the Chancellor of the Exchequer ap
pears to have carried the Cabinet in his
opposition to such a step. .
It is openly said that the indisposition
of the Chancellor is more diplomatic than
organic. Those who waited on Colonial
Secretary Chamberlain yesterday to dis
cuss the position of the trade of the -West
Indies went away with a strong impres â¢
sion that the Government, even at this
late date, had not definitely decided how
to raise the sum represented by the enor
mous deficit.
LONDON, April 11.â In spite of to-day's
announcement that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, is
progressing bo well that it is certain he
will be able to introduce the budget on
Monday next, there are many who believe
that another postponement Is likely to
occur.
Monday night. Miller said, he arranged
with MiiS Jennett to meet her at the cor
rer of Warren avenue and Fourteenth
street about 11 o'clock Wednesday night,
'iney were. to discuss what was best to
be <ione to avoid disgrace. He said he
lixed the hour at 11 because he had to
attend a meeting of the Wolverine Circle,
while she said she was going to a com
mittee meeting at Garland Rebekah
Lodge.
"\\ hen did you make up your mind to
kill the girl?" Miller was asked.
"Last Wednesday afternoon." he an
swered. - ' "I was ' thinking of what could
be done and of my being married and
with a family when my eye fell on a
hatchet up at the house. It seemed to tell
the way out of the trouble and the idea
of killing the girl swept over me with
irresistible force then. I felt that I had
to do something. I felt that I had to get
rid of her. She was infatuated with me
end continually chasing me. If I gave a
concert anywhere she was sure to be ia
the neighborhood."
Wednesday night when he started from
home for the lodge meeting he had an
engagement with ihe girl and intended
to KM her. He took witn him the hatchet
that was found by the 'officers yesterday
in his kitchen. He secreted this on Sev
cntii on his way to Â¦Â¦ the meeting.
When he left the lodgerooms he secured
ine natcnet again ana proceeded to the
corner or Fouiteentn stteet and Warren
avenue, where lie met Miss Jennett. They
valkeo. over to 'ihirteentn street and out
to wnere the Killing was done.
Miller says they sat down on the side
walk ana talked ior a while, the girl urg
ing him to aoandou nis family and leave
me city witn ner. He tnen whipped out
ine hatchet and struck her on-tne head.
Wiien asked why he mutilated her so.
Miller Kaid he had no recollection of any
ihing arter the tirst blow until he found
himself wiping the blood on: his hatchet
un tne grass in the vacant lot.
Miller said that he had had Illicit rela
tions with the girl and was responsible

tend Miss Jennett to a hospital, but she
icfused to go, insisting that he leave his

Complaint was made to the Coroner's
office yesterday by Albert Pohlmeier 'that
undue haste had been made in burying the
body of his mother, who died on April 8.
and he said he strongly suspected that
her death had not been due to natural
causes. Deputy Coroner McCormick made
an investigation and ascertained that the
woman, who was 63 years old. had died of
cerebral apoplexy at the home of J. K.
Scike, qn the San Bruno road. The son
and a daughter of the woman had re
fused to aid in the expenses of the funeral
and Seike had asked that the body be In
terred the day following the death, so
that" he might not lose further time from
his work. The old woman has been de
serted by her children for the last eight
years and was taken care of by Seike and
his wife, in return for which she deeded
them her residence on the San Bruno

It is hinted that the court openly ex
pressed its satisfaction in the former de
cision that the Fair children would not
lose their father's property, and that the

the settlement of the dispute in regard

that the matter should be decided on
points of law only. â¢
Garret W. McEnerney. in behalf of the
executors of the Fair will, filed a second
petition for a rehearing in the matter of
the disposal of the personal property, at
the Supreme Court yesterday. The new
petition is written in a very respectful
tone, but like the one fil^d a few days
ago is somewhat sarcastic.
It is argued that the trust clause as to
the personalty should hold, even though
so far as the realty is concerned it Is in
valid. Attorney McEnerney at one point
in his argument says: "If this last de
cision of the court be allowed to stand,

Rev. M. V..- Donaldson, the Methodist

town of Vacaville on account of alleged
escapades with female members of his
flock, is in San Francisco, but is keep-
Ing his movements secret. He 1 is- living
with his wife in furnished rooms at 567
Geary street, but has been asked by his
landlady to find other quarters as soon
as possible. Mrs. Donaldson, < who \ is a
saleslady, has accepted her husband's ex

doing and declared last ., night that he
was the victim of malice. Donaldson de
clined to be seen when a request was
made for a statement that- he clear the
reputation of' the* women whose names
had been mentioned in connection with
the Vacaville scandal. , . \
The Donaldsons ; were married- fourteen
years ago and have a daughter twelve

Just before leaving, Donaldson was
forced to sign a note for the payment of
a board bill to the amount of $96, and
another of $50 for money borrowed of one
of the y6ung men of .his flock.
At a 'meeting to be held to-morrow
evening by the church elders, the ques
tion of expelling the young, women whom
Donaldson, disgraced will come up for
discussion, vand the selection of a new
pastor will be decided upon.
While some of his church members
were threatening him on Tuesday and
Wednesday, Donaldson threatened several
young women who were present with ex
posure of their alleged questionable con
duct unless they remained silent. Of one
young woman he told of having some of
her wearing apparel in his room, and
after his departure the articles were
found there. ' i--v*v.
That Donaldson's field of. operations
was not limited to Vacaville is proved
by the fact that a few months ago . he
was ordered from a hotel in Dixon, in
company with a woman, and that he rare
ly missed a week during his residence
here without one or two trips out of
town, which he made either under cover
of darkness or through rural districts -in
the daytime to the station at Elmlra.
Donaldson was a good customer of the
telephone and telegraph companies, and
many messages were sent to women of
San Francisco that answer not to the
name of Mrs. Donaldson.

Late yesterday afternoon Donaldson
suddenly departed from Vacaville. To
several he said that he was going to the

Strand was taken to .the office of the

veloped that Strand had been acquainted
with Gavin for several years and knew
that Gavin was not working recently and
always seemed to have plenty of monev.
He suspected that Gavin must be en

did not know anything about him except
through common report.
As there was no evidence connecting
Strand with the gang Mr. Banning or

Rich Strike in Lightner Mine.
STOCKTON, April 11.â News . reached
Stockton to-day that a rich strike has
been made in the Lightner mine at An
gels. / A ledge was encountered â¢ a A few
days -ago which is enormously, rich, the
ore assaying from $25,000 to $30,000 a ton.
The ledge is â¢ sixteen feet wide - in one
place and three feet in another. Its ex
tent is r.ot-known. .
WHILE flames raged and crack
led from the basement to the
roof of Notre Dame Academy.
on Chestnut street and San
Antonio avenue, Alameda,
early yesterday morning tne tweive nuns
connected with the convent aroused twen
ty-flve little girls sleeping in a dormitory
on the third floor and led or carried all
of the children down winding stairways
to places of safety outside of the burning
building.- Not one of the sisters faltered
in the dangerous task of rcsculng.the tots
from peril. To the coolnes^and heroic
actions of the brave women is due the
fact that all escaped the flames. . â¢ ..
Many of the children wore only their
night robes. Others were partially dressed
thoroughly subdue the flames. John F.
Hanson of Thompson Hose Company and
Andrew Nissen of Chemical Engine No. 1
were overcome by escaping gas and smoke
while working on the second floor. They
were dragged to places of safety by com
rades. : Â¦ â¢â¢ Â¦ â¢ .. â¢ .
Fall Through Ceiling.
George T. Morris of Thompson Hose
Company and Charles Beuck of Citizen
Truck Company fell through burned cell
ings, but . escaped . with minor injuries.
Lack of water pressure in the mains hand
icapped the fire department considerably
and Chief Krauth found it necessary at
one time to depend mostly upon the chem
ical engines.
From the main entrance to the top of
the building and toward the center the
flames played the greatest havoc. This
portion of the convent will have to be re
built practically. . The damage done will
reach $5000, covered by insurance. The
work of repairing the academy will be
undertaken at once.' In the meantime the
Sisters' of Notre Dame will occupy La
fayette Hall.- The lower part will^be
utilized as living quarters and the upper
portion for classrooms.
It is. believed that the fire originated
from a defective gas pipe, near the meter
under the front stairway. It is thought
that an inspector who 'examined the meter
and connection a few days ago lighted a
match to test the pipe and ignited a small
leak which he did not then discern. This
flame, it is. supposed,, continued Â¦; to burn
and yesterday,- morning "set the-, building
on fire. . â¢,..*Â¦â¬ ..-/",i -. Â¦'.Â¦:.Â¦ Â¦

Although Chief Krauth and his firemen
quickly arrived- at the scene of the -fire
there was no life-saving for them -to do.
The sisters had . completed . this heroic
task. They were also instrumental - In
preventing the destruction of quantities
of clothes belonging to the children â¢ and
themselves, bedding, furniture and hbuse
hold goods, which they carried beyond, the
reach of fire arid water. . . : ;; '- '/ >
It required three hours of hard labor,
on the part of the fire department^ to
It was at 5:30 o'clock, when the sisters
were leaving 1 , the chapel on the 'second
floor after devotions, that: fire', was-; seen
darting from beneath the stairway, to "the
main entrance of the academy arid' from
the front porch to .the cross on the" top
of the building. Several â¢ paper carriers
observed the flames at the same time and
turned in an alarm. Without waiting for
assistance and before the fire department
arrived Sister Superior Mary St. George
organized the nuns Into a rescue brigade

SEATTLE, April 1L â Detectives Wren
and Taylor of the San Francisco Police
Department arrived in this city this af
ternoon and left again for San Francisco
with LouIa Kauffmann, one of the alleged
murderers of Policeman Robinson. The
prisoner has been very ugly and trouble
some.
Kauffmann arrived from the East to
day and was taken to Seattle this after
noon. Throughout the long trip he was
guarded day and night. One of the de
tectives always sat with a revolver in
easy reach and the murderer had not
the slightest chance of escape.
It was while departing from Fort Wil
liams last Monday that the first trouble
occurred. The victim of Kauffmann's
gang in Ban Francisco had been known
to one or two residents there, and they
took up his case very feelingly. Several
times residents of the town suggested to
Wren that if he gave them a chance they
Â¦would put Itauffmann where he couid
commit no more murders, and oh the
night of their departure a crowd assem
bled between the jail and the station.
The plan was to relieve the San Fran
cisco detectives of their charge and to
string Kauffmann to the nearest post.
An hour before the train left the two
detectives quietly drove Kauffmann away
to the border of the town and made ar
rangements with the station agent to
have the train stop there. This scheme
was carried out to the letter, and when
the train drew away from the railroad
station the crowd knew it had been foiled.
When the travelers were a day out
from Winnipeg a similar attempt was
made by two cattlemen. One of them
called Wren out of the car on some pre
text and the other calmly proceeded to
"run a bluff"- to compel Detective Tay
lor to give up his prisoner. The cattlemen,
had no particular interest in the case,
except that they knew Kauffmann was a
murderer and they were not averse to
seeing the quick justice of the prairies
dealt out to him. The detectives succeed
ed In dissuading them from any attempt
to interfere with the process of the law.
VANCOUVER. B. C, April 11.âKauff
jnann. thÂ« murderer of Policeman Robin
son in San Francisco, has had two ex
ceedingly narrow escapes from having his
miserable life cut off at short notice since
his arrest in Fort Williams several weeks
ago. The attempts on his life occurred
during the last ten days, and, but for the
Â¦watchfulness of two San Francisco de
tectives. Wren and Taylor, he certainly
Â¦would have been given short shrift on
at least one of the occasions.

While cross currents in trade and industry

NEW YORK. April 11.â The fears of a cor
ner in Louisville and Nashville were some
what abated to-day, which seemed to be the
principal factor in the tendency toward re
covery in the market. Speculative sentiment
ehowed itself sensitive, however, to the move
ments in Louisville and Nashville. Thus when
very large buying appeared In other parts of
the market and when Louisville and Nashville
ran off to 1% under last night there was a
prompt rally elsewhere in the market. This
see-saw waÂ« more or less conspicuous all day,
especially at periods when Louisville and Nash
ville was particularly active. The market for
that stock continued very feverish on an enor
mous volume of dealings, but the fluctuations
were by no means so wild as yesterday. There
â¢were, indications that the money powers back
of the movement were disposed to handle it
more tenderly out of consideration for the
effect upon the rest of the market. The stock
touched 122 Vi at the top and closed with a
net gain of 1%. Ae for Southern Railway. It
fell back to a position uniform with a num
ber of other active Ftocks in the market and
moved narrowly. The strength which the
market showed as a whole was by no means
universal or evenly distributed. The Govern
ment crop report caused some depression here
end there among the grangers, which was
overcome. Amalgamated Copper was consist
ently Etrong and rose nearly 3 points at the
lBMt. The return to the city of one of the
principal stockholders and directors was im
puted as the cause of the market. The gen
erally credited report that the purchase of the
Choctaw Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad was in
the interest' of the Rock Island was followed
by a 2V4-Polnt gain In that stock, but the
dealings were merely nominal and the gain
Â¦was wiped out. Some of the buying of the
day waa based on the prospect that the bank
statement to-morrow will show an improved
condition by the clearing-house institutions.
The loss to the pub-treasury is $1,450,000,
which is over a million dollars less than the
payments to that institution for the cold ex
ported The receipts on balance from the
Interior have exceeded the loss to the public
treasury by a small margin. The expectation
is seriÂ«ral that the banks will show a con
traction of loans, as loans in the stock market
have been called during the week. These ha\Â«
been shifted partly to the trust companies and
foreign leans have also gone to supply the
week's demands.' Some recuperation in the
surplus of the banks, therefore, seem* prob
able. It is supposed that the enactment of
the New York law extending the list of bonds
available . for eavinss bank investment will
result in some release of funds which have
been employed in holding these bonds pending
the enactment of the law. The action of the
Treasury Department In increasing deposits
with national banks upward of $5,000,000, With
the assurance of further monthly increases in
proportion had a favorable effect .upon senti
ment, although there was no immediate result
apparent. The peace rumors from London were
practically ignored. The British budaret state
ment of next week is awaited for clearer light
on the situation In the London market.
The bond market was somewhat irregular.

Provisions.
CHICAGO, April 11. â Prices in wheat, hadla
good upturn early as a result, of ..the crop "re
port and strong cables, the latter probably." re-,
fleeting foreign interpretation -on .the 4 , crop 'Â¦. re
port. Traders had t-xpected a bearish report;
yesterday, but -the curb action ] had* prepared'
them for an early bulge.- May started %c to
%c higher at 72%c to 72V4c, bat 'Â¦as- is custom^
ary on report days the crowd sold and May
dipped, to 71 %c. Speculation was rife as '-to
just what way to. take the report.' The' de
partment set the April condition at' 78. 7, as :
compared' to 91'.7 J a ye'ar ago â the lowest con
dition with three exceptions in fifteen' years.
The' best yield suggested by the crop .'was 415.
000,000..bushels. . .The .department idid: not re>
vise Its figures on the acreage from the pro
visional estimate in December of 32,000,000
acres.' t The Â¦ department,- howeven\ promised to
revise the acreage May 1. and with the knowl
edge that Kansas has plowed up 1.080,000 acres
and the. probability of at least '.half as. much
more In -Texas- and Oklahoma: traders .-figured
that probably the acreage harvested thia year
would exceed by only a. small, margin that of
a year ago. If the acreage Is brought down to
last year's level the yield suggested by the re
port will be only about 365,000.000 bushels.
After the'early selling by the trade a real bull
market started: ' Corn developed ' independent
strength and helped in the upturn. The profes
sionals took the bull side and May spurted to
73c. . Profit taking caused a reaction, but the
close was firm. May ?4@%c higher at 72%<3
72%c. ' . . Â¦ ' â¢
Early trade In -corn was of much -the. same
character as that in wheat.' Later, whftn
wheat advanced,., corn a lot of bull
ish news of Its own.,- St. Louis and Kansas
City were bullish and very strong. May closed
firm. *<i@%c higher at 59%c. .. Â¦ ; ,
Oats differed from the other- pits and were
sort of a prize puzzle to traders. May was
offered in liberal quantities, but the firmness
of the other grains held it steamy. Â¦Â¦ May closed
unchanged' and steady at 41%c. '. '
Provisions were strong all day until just be
fore the close, when profit taking took off some
cf the gain. May pork closed 5c higher, lard
and- ribs a shade up. â¢ Â¦ '' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦"-'Â¦

Northern ; B iisiness.
Butter is stacking up and quotations are de
clining in consequence. The Portland market
}s now under this, hence the Sound and British
Columbia have transferred their orders to that
market, : though yesterday's steamer took out
7886 pounds.' The loss of this northern business
will make considerable difference ' here. The
Exchange yesterday, after .considerable discus
sion* and a -leristhy consideration of the- situa
tion, reduced its prices all around; making the
new quotations as follows: Creameries, 17@I8c;
dairies,' 15@17c; store, 15c.' The- commission
houses also sold lower, and still were far from
cleaning up. " Â¦Â¦Â¦'â¢ : Â¦ ; ,: â¢ V Â¦Â¦ Â¦ V '

Receipts of Eggs are running so large that
they excite considerable comment. The mar
ket is too heavily supplied, and the feeling is
weak, with a general disposition to sell. The
Exchange reduced its quotations to 13@14c for
ranch and 12%@l.'ic for gathered.
Receipts were 94,400 pounds, 77 tubs and 1

At the regular monthly meeting of the
board of directors of the Merchants' As
sociation held yesterday it was decided to
send to the Board of Supervisors a com
munication expressing disapproval of the
erection of electric light signs -upon the
tops of buildings if the structures are
such 'as to be either disfiguring or dan
gerous.
The. association advocates the liberal
use of electrical devices in advertising,
on the ground that the city is thus made
attractive at night, but it is considered
that there should be reasonable restric
tions. The Board of Supervisors is re
quested to pass an ordinance limiting the
size and .height of such signs and pre
scribing the manner of their construction.

CHIEF WITTMAN FEARS . ,; â¢
HE CANNOT BE PRESENT
Detectives Bailey and Riordan, with O.
H, Schaef er and Miss Mabel Miller, spent
nearly all day yesterday searching In the
neighborhood of Trocadero and Ingleslde
for clew3 that might lead to the discovery
of Schaefer's wife and . mother-in-law,
whose disappearance Tuesday afternoon
led the family to fear that a tragedy
had occurred. At 5 o'clock they returned
to Schaefer's home at 1126 Mission street,
weary and discouraged, and much to their
surprise they found' the objects of their
search in the house, .comfortably, en
sconced in easy chairs. v
The surprise was mutual, lor Mrs.
Schaef er and her mother, Mrs. Eva Mil
ler, had not read the newspapers, and did
not luxow that, an appeal had been made
to the police department to find them or
to discover their fate.-
To the astonished detectives and rela
tives the women said that they left Ingle
slde about half past 6 o'clock.. They, got
off>the car at Sixth street to go to the
Schaef eir home, as Mrs. Miller was feeling
ill and the daughter was afraid that her
sister, Miss Mabel Miller, would be fright
ened into illness If she took the. mother
to her home. at 845 Mission street. Mrs.
Miller- became very much worse, they re
late, and the two went to a - Sixth-street
lodging-house and took a room, where
they passed the~ day from Tuesday until
yesterday . afternoon.
Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Schaeffer decline
to : tell \ the name of the lodging-house
where they stayed, and Schaef er Is not
inclined to discuss the episode. ~ He is
satisfied with their - explanation and the
detectives are breathing easily again,
happy to have ' escaped the difficulties of
another murder mystery.

But Barney is not the only, gem in the
Monticello cluster. Hastening hither from
the south is Isadore Dockweller, prepared
to exalt Jefferson dead and Snyder living.
The hint comes that the fluent Dockweiler
will launch the boom of Snyder for Gov
ernor. Barney Murphy, however,* holds
the post of honor as president of the club.
As presiding officer he cannot launch: his
own. candidacy,* but he can- reluctantly
allow some other disciple of Jefferson. to
blaze the Murphy trail through Northern
and Central California. Dockweiler, how
ever, comes fully prepared to respond to
the toast, "Democracy South of Tehach
apl." Of course this is a broad sentiment,
but geographically considered it does not
embrace Democracy south of Market
street. Here is the full list of speakers
and the toasts to which they .will re
spond:
There will be a time at the Poodle Dog

fersonian Democracy begin to ' neigh.
Leading chargers ' of the party from all
the way along the coast, from the red
wood forests of Humboldt to the. orange
groves of Los Angeles, will gather at the
banquet board of -the Monticello.Club.
Thomas Jefferson, of course, cannot leave
the shades of Monticello to loiter at the
feast, but his spirit will animate the
orators and enjoin them to . forsake -the
yellow idols and reavow allegiance to Jef
fersonian principles. Of course ; Jefferson
was the greatest expansionist the world

Enquist Is Mentioned.
Herrin's position is somewhat peculiar.
He knows that he Is on the eve of retire
ment as political manager . of the South
ern Pacific and would therefore like to
win a victory before President Harriman
abolishes the political bureau. While Her
rin Is not a sagacious politician he knows
enough to perceive that Gape, who wpn
out in 1898 as the people's candidate, can
not win this year as the railroad's can
didate. In 1898 the forces of the party
were united to promote the election â¢ of
Gage. Money Â¦ was contributed by the
merchants, the banks, the corporations,
labor organizations and industrial insti
tutions. The war, was on and. young and
old rallied around the * flag. General
Barnes, E. P. Preston, ex-Governor
Markham, Frank H. Short, Samuel M.
Shortrldge and many other able public
speakers inspired the Republican hosts
to great enthusiasm. . The flag .was sent
to'the fronfwhlle Herrin and Burns were
discreetly concealed In the rear,- but. ready'
to 3j>ring forward when the battle was
done to grasp the fruits of victory. Her
rln Is in close touch - with leading ' repre
sentatives of the Republican State Com
mittee and knows full well that the task
of raising money In the party for a sec
ond campaign with: Gage as leader, would
be hopeless. Â¦' The railroad ' company | and
the candidates ' for office ' .would be com
pelled to bear the whole burden â¢' of .- the"
struggle. Herrln would, not- grieve' if
Gage should get Into the Senatorial fight.
Perkins, - however, would Immediately be
gin a revision , of . Lynch' s proposed list of
candidates 'for- the- Legislature from
Southern California. The - Senator trust
ed Lynch- once but now speaks with .re
gret of misplaced confidence and a bogus
telegram... -.- 'Â¦ \ - â¢
Herrin's Peculiar Position.
There Is not the slightest doubt that in
ternal dissensions exist In the Gage camp.
The Burns men are sore and surly - be
cause they know that ' Herrln - has sup
planted the colonel in the confidence of
the Executive. They know. that Burns Is
on record as declaring that he would not
do- politics with any man, high pr low,
that recognized Crimmins. They -know,
further, that Gage and Herrln, alter con
sidering-the colonel's declaration, re
solved that recognition of Crimmins
should continue and that the friends and
relatives of the little boss on the State
pay roll should remain there, even ir
Burns demanded their dismissal.
Three prominent State office-holders
who are known to be close advisers of the
Governor tell Gage that the cause of the
popular feeling against his candidacy- is
due wholly to his association with Dan
Burns. They tell him that he cannot ex
pect to re-establish himself in the public
confidence as long as Burns is recognized
as the right arm of the State administra
tion. Meanwhile Burns is sawing wood.
He has a clear notion that the hammers
are going and is awaiting results. George
A. Knlgnt, a State officer who Is .drawing
down a handsome salary as attorney to
the State Board of Health, although a
personal friend of the Governor,, is so
much chagrined over the political aspect
that he announces his determination Ho
keep away from the Ban Jose convention
and devote his energy -to ! the trial of . a
law case In the up country. If he went
to San Jose he might in the fervor of his
eloquence and the frankness of his speech
describe the true situation in the Gov
ernor's camp. â¢. -
Dissension in Gage Camp.
Gage's repeated - assertions In. the cam
paign of 1898 that one term as Governor of
California would fill the measure of his
political ambition are recalled. Signifi
cance is attached to Gage's recent an
nouncement of his candidacy for another
term. He intimated that he would be
governed by the wishes of the people. It
is certainly clear to the Governor and to
all of his intelligent counselors that the
Republican voters are not clamoring for
his candidacy. It Is clear, also, to the
minds of the ablest politicians that party
harmony, under Gage leadership is unat
tainable. . . . ' .
' There is more than a little agitation in
the camp of the allied bosses, and Gage
is listening to the suggestion that it
would be good politics- on his part to step
out of the contest for renomination to the
office he now holds and enter the race for
the United States Senatorship. Some of
the warmest supporters of Senator .Per
kins apprehend that such a general read
justment of plans is in contemplation by
Gage's managers. Politicians who are
supposed to have inside sources of infor
mation would not be surprised If the an
nouncement of Gage's retirement from
the gubernatorial race should be made In
clear and convincing style to the San Jose
convention. Political gossip goes to the
point of reporting that Gage's" transfer
able strength would then be given to
Prank P. Flint of Los Angeles.

Mrs. Seeliger is of â¢ a religious turn of
mind and attends church regularly, but
her. piety, she alleges, is objected to by
*ier husband. He says, she alleges, that
all "church-goers' are cheats," and that
they go "just-for a blind." .
"I was so frightened that during his ab
sence I took the children and ran to the
home of "my mother at 3383 Mission
street," says Mrs. Seeliger.
"On one occasion,'.' alleges Mrs. Seeli- !
ger, "he sharpened two razors in my pres- j
ence and threatened to kill the whol&i
family. He left the house, after uttering^
the threat to procure a pistol, saying, as I
he did so, that when he came back there j
would be lots of bloodshed. :
She alleges further that on another oc
casion he ordered her out of â¢ the house,
and would have : hastened her departure
by throwing her down stairs had he not
been prevented by Charles Rice and John
Horning. She alleges also that he pointed
a pistol at her one night and would have

Lind' explains that -he was not present

hence did not know that there was danger

toyed* with the weapon and that it went
off accidentally and killed her.
Mikkelson says that he has not been in
the habit of keeping the pistol loaded. He
usually has' the- cartridges in a : small bag,
but wishing yesterday to use this bag
for another purpose" he placed the shells
in the revolver and laid it on a table. I '
Mrs. Smith-then noticed Mikkelson's re

it was -loaded. â¢ Lind- replied "no," and
