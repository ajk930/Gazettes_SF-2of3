Pays a Visit to Albany and West Point.
Prince Henry's last day on the special train which carried him to the South.
West and East rivaled in interest any of the others spent by the Prince on the
tour, for it began with a visit to Albany, included a run in bright sunlight
down the west shore of the Hudson River and closed with a reception at the
United States Military Academy at West Point. It was 2 o'clock wiien the
special train departed from Boston and daylight when it was climbing through
The United States. He is fully aware of the fact that he has had only a super
ficial glimpse of a very email portion of the United States and that he might
-ierhaps have used his time to greater advantage had he remained In one of
the larger of the Eastern cities. But he is convinced, nevertheless, that, con
sidering the character of his missloi. the trip was the right thing for him to
do. In making it he has obtained a very fair idea of the vastness of the coun
try and its resources, which the capital of the United States and the great
commercial centers of the East alone could not have given him. But more than
this impression he values the hearty welcome which he met in all the places he
vent through, a welcome that showed him how the people of the United States
everywhere understood and appreciated the intention of the German Emperor
in sending him here.
"The Prince made a speech in St. Louis in which he said he regretted not
to have been able always to express his thanks to those who greeted him at
the railway stations or who otherwise decired to show him their respects. He
v.ishes to have the Intent of that speech conveyed to all those who in the
course of the trip gave him such a cordial reception, and especially he wishes
to express his thanks to those who early in the morning, when he was not pre
pared and etill in bed, welcomed him with musJc and cheers.
"The receptions by the great cities of the South and the Middle West were
more than he ever had expected, and 60 were the receptions in the East. 1 But
his Royal Highness is equally thankful for what the smaller places did In
showing him their good will, though the train iÂ« : Â» = h places stopped only a few
minutes and frequently not at all."
NEW YORK. March ".-Prince Henry of Prussia to-day completed his tour

Wreckage Marks the
Work of Waves.
According to Conductor Stockwell's report the wreck was at a point
where the grade terminates in a reverse curve. The train left the track on
the other side of the curve, which destroys the theory that the accident was
caused by the train running at a high rate of speed, in which case it would
have been deposited on the other side. The remaining solution of the cause
was there \vas*a broken flange.
, The cause of the wreck is not known, and in all probability will remain a
mystery. Railroad men in this city have many suggestions as to how it could
have occurred, and assert it may have been the work of wreckers.
When at last communication was made with Sanderson. San Antonio
and El Paso, wrecking trains left for the scene from this place and San An
tonio, surgeons for the company being called up all along the line. A relief
train was also dispatched from Sanderson, which took to the survivors of the
wreck clothes and covering.
Wreckers May Have Caused Disaster.
Â¦ Conductor Stockwell, who was only slightly injured, upon finding his
crew were killed and disabled, started out for Tabor to warn the eastbound
train. For two hours he dragged himself through darkness, arriving in time
to stop the approaching train.
\V. G. Van Vleck, general manager of the Galveston, Harrisburjr and San
Antonio Railroad, was at San Antonio, and left at once on a special train
for th- scene of the wreck.
As soon as it was possible to get in communication with the division
headquarters relief trains with surgeons and physicians were started from El
Paso, Del Rio and Sanderson, picking up all along the line ail the surgeons
that could be found.
All of the injured who were in a condition to be moved were sent to El
Paso, where they received careful attention.
The wrecked train was the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio west
bound passenger No.- 9, and consisted of an engine, mail car, baggage car,
one coach, one chair car. three tourist sleepers, one Pullman sleeper and one
private car. The mail car, the baggage car and coaches were piled together
against the engine and were ablaze in a few seconds. It was impossible to
move any of the coaches or the tourist cars, as they were all off the raiU and
were soon consumed by the flames.
All the injured in the coaches just behind the express and baggage cars
were cremated. The people in the sleepers were saved with the assistance
of the uninjured passengers.
A private car owned by Thomas Ryan ot New York City, with his fam
ily aboard, was attached to the rear of the train, but it was pulled away before
the lire reached it. and no one in it was injured.
and twenty-eight were more or less injured. The ill-fated train left
Antonio at noon Thursday, two and a half hours late, and at the time the
accident occurred was runninfj at a high rate of speed to make up time. The
road at the point where the wreck occurred is in a rough country, the curves
being sÂ»harp and the grades heavy. It was when rounding a curve that the
train left the track, it i* said, on account of a broken rail. The hour^ wa*
,1 a. m., fifteen hours after the train had left San Antonio, showing tl\at it
was still behind time. All the passenger? were asleep, and the shock that
fpllowcd was the first intimation they had of the danger. The train was
going at such a rate of speed that the tender and engine landed seventy-five
feet from wlrerc they left the rails. The ears behind piled up against the en
gine, caught fire, and nit 'wen: consumed, except the sleepers.

Senator Morgan, the ranking Democratic member of the Committee on For

nation In the Caribbean Sea to Germany, France or any other nation, pro
vidod it was not fortilied."
Senator Dubois said: "We are glad to have Prince Henry visit us and we
will lavish American hospitality upon him. but we cannot and will not stretch the
Monroe doctrine to a breaking point to allow Germany to have a coaling sta
tion over here."
Monroe Doctrine Cannot Be Stretched.
Senator Heitfeld. iaaho. said: "I am of German descent, but I would not
consent to the proposition of allowing Germany a coaling station on this side
of the water in violation of the principles laid down in the Monroe doctrine.
If such is the motive for Prince Henry's visit to this country he is going "about
it in a very diplomatic way, but it will not succeed."
Senator Burrows of Michigan said: "We are very glad to have Prince Henry
come over to visit us and we have given him a royal welcome, but if he expects
to Fneak in under the Monroe tent we will see him when he attempts to crawl
under the canvas. I have no Idea lhat Germany has any ulterior motives in
feuding Prince Henry over here other than to cultivate frtenjlyjrelatjqns and
?rtiprare Tzr-T&RmnnxF. IT she hopes to secure our permission to Tocat^.a coal
inx station in South American waters as a result of the Prince's visit, his trip
to the United States will certainly prove a failure."
"I have heard considerable gossip and speculation about the real object of
Trince Henry's visit to this country. I have also heard that Germany is plan
ning; to pet leave for the Government to establish a repair and coaling station
in South American waters. The American people will not sanction anything of
that kind. We are always willing to receive foreign visitors cordially and give
'..hem hospitable greeting, but we are staid when It comes to giving up our rights

a brother-in-law of J. O. - Derr, manager of the retail department of the Stock
ton Woolen Mills. This was his fourth accident and after his third he. declared
that the next accident would surely be his death. The first narrow escape he
had was caused by a conductor havinp given him wrong orders. He met an
other train and It was by the utmost good fortune that he managed to avoid a
head-on collision that would have resulted in the death of many passengers.
The next narrow escape /was 'when Mexicans pulled up a rail to ditch the train
that they might rob the passengers. The job was carelessly- done, however, and
the section hands found the loose rail in time to make repairs. The next train
due was Mast's. The third occasion %vas the narrowest escape of all. Wh'le

children in their arms and mothers with children lying dead in the front coach
were taken to the hotels or the hospitals.' Husbands and wives clung to each

"We could do nothing else but bring in
a verdict oÂ» given. There was so little
evidence Introducedâ in-fact, there la such
a mystery surrounding the horrible affair
â that, considering the condition of the
body, it was almost impossible 'â¢ to defi
nitely determine anything. Therefore wo
had to rely more upon Mrs. Walsh's
habits during 1 her lifetime than upon evi
dence found after death. The verdict
does not clear up the mystery, in my
mind." . - .' Â¦ .
SAX RAFAEL, March 7.â The Coroner's
inquest over the body of Mrs. Mary
Walsh, who was burned to death in her
home on Wednesday night, took place to
day. Coroner Edeu impaneled nine men
to act as jurors, and alter deliberating a
short time they returned a verdict that
deceased met deaih by fire, indirectly re
sulting from a stroke of apoplexy.
From the auiop^y surgeons testimony
and l'rom other witnesses the theory that
the old lady was murdered appeared to
be weil grounded. Dr. Wicicman, who
performea the autopsy, was the chief
witness at the inquest. He testuied that
the body was so badly charred that, it
was almost impossible to determine the
exact cause of death, but from what he
knew ot the health of Mrs. Walsh and
the condition in which he found her brain
after death he believed she had had an
attack of apoplexy; that she had fallen,
overturning a liirny and causing the con
flagration that resulted in her death.
When asked if he had discovered any
fracture of the skull the physician replioU
that he had found a hole in the sKull, and
that this might have been caused by a
biow oil the dead, but he believed it was
# caused simply by the lire burning through
. the ekuli. He also stated that there was.
a clot of blood upon -the brain that might
have been the result of a blow or of apo
plexy. In conclusion the doctor gave the
jury as his private opinion that he be u
lieved Mrs. Walsh'8 death was due to
apoplexy. The Jury acted on this state
ment. . .':Â¦Â¦''Â¦Â¦

Until Coffee Hits You Hani.
It is about as well to advise, people to
ttick to coffrc iintil they get hit hard
enough, so that they will never forget
their experience, althcugh it Is rather un-
pleasant to have to look back to half a
dozen years of invalidism, money and op-
portunity thrown away, which Is really
the terrible price paid for the weakest
kind of a "rcess of pottage."
A woman writes and her letter is con-
densed to give the facts in a short space.
"1 was a coffee slave and stuck to it like
a toper in his 'cups,' notwithstanding I
had heaoaches every day,. and frequently
severe attacks of sick headaches, then I
used more coffee to relieve the head-
aches,' and this was well enough until tha
coffee stixÂ»ulant wore off, then I would
have sick spells. Finally my dig-eetion .
was ruined, severe attacks of rheumatism
began to appear, and ultimately the
whole nervous system began to break
down and 1 was fast becoming a wreck.
:'At this time I was induced to quit
coflfce and take tip Postum Food Coffee.
This was half a year ago.; The . result
hus been most satisfactory. The rheu-
matism is gone entirely, blood is pure,
nerves practically well and steady, di-
gestion almost perfect, never Â¦ have any-
more sick headaches and , am gaining

LONDON, March 7. â There was an In
teresting scene in the City Temple yes
terday when, during the course of his ser
mon, Rev. Joseph Parker, D. Â£)., the min
ister, administered a rebuke to King Ed
ward, which was loudly applaued by the
congregation.
Having alluded to public houses as "trap
doors of hell," Dr. Parker referred to the
King's recent brewing of beer while vis
iting Lord Burton.
"Pray for me," said the divine,, "that
I may speak delicately, loyally. If the
King brews beer, what can be wrong in
the subject drinking it? What the Kins
does is likely to bevtmitated by others.
His Majesty is more than a man, and
must regard all questions from a kingly
point of view. If the King goes to a Sun
day concert, as he did recently, he deals
a deadly blow to the Englishman's Sun
day. The King cannot attend a non
conformist place of worship, but he can
go to a Sunday concert."
This remark called forth cries of
"Shame," and Dr. Parker continued:

NEW YORK, March 7.â The New York
agents of the Cunard line said to-day
they had received no further information
of the Etruria, but the steamer Elbe will
take off the Etruria's passengers and
transfer them to Liverpool.
LONDON, March 7.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mail from Horta, Azores, Islands,^
says the Cunard steamer Etruria Is hour
ly expected at that port. About 7 o'clock
on the evening of February 27, continues
the correspondent of the Daily Mail, a
rumbling sound in the engine rooms of
the Etruria, followed by. a crash, an
nounced that the propeller had gone, and
it 'was soon discovered it had carried
away the rudder with it.
The Etruria. was then in latitude 40.03
north, longitude 40.36 west. She was ex
periencing tine weather, although not long
before the weather had been blustering.
There was no* excitement among the pas
sengers when, they heard of the accident.
An hour previous to losing her propel
ler the Etruria. had exchanged good-night
signals with the Cunard steamer Umbria
at a distance of about forty miles, and
had dispatched various wireless tele
graphic messages from her passengers

Shortly after the accident the Etruria
tried again, but unsuccessfully, to call
up the Umbria. The same night the Brit

NEW YORK, March 7.â Leading inter
ests in the United States Steel Corpora
tion say that reports of a proposed con
version of the preferred stock into bonds
are premature. It is said that the propo
sition had been discussed by the financial
committee and has been taken up in a
casual way by the directors, but beyond
this nothing has-been determined.
According to report,' it is< not unlikely
that it may be deemed advisable to issue
bonds to the extent of $250,000,000 without
any disturbance of the present preferred
stock issue. This can be done, it "is
pointed out, by charging the bonds to ac
count of one of the subsidiary companies
of the steel corporation. Reports from
the West telling of the probable resigna
tion of Elbert H. Gary from the chair
manship of the steel corporation's execu
tive committee are discredited.

7QliEÂ¥lEADACHE~
One Very Common Canse, Generally
Overlooked.
Headache is a sjTuptom, an indication of de-
rcrretnent or disease in some organ, and the
cause of tbe headache is difficult to locate be-
cause so many diseases have headache as a
Iirominent symptom; derangement of the
5tomach anfl liver, heart trouble, kidney dis-
ease, lung trouble, eye strain or ill-fitting
glasses all produce headaches, and if ws could
Elways locate the orga-a which Is at' fault the
cure of obstinate headaches would be a' much
matter.
*Howwer, for that form of headache called
frontaJ headache, pain back of the eyes and in
forehead, the cause is now known to be catarrh
f.f the head and throat; when the headache is
located in back of head and neck It is -often
caused from cstarrh of the stomach or liver.
At any rate catarrh is the most . common
cause of such* headaches and the cure of the
catarrh causes a prompt disappearance of the
headaches.
There Is at present no treatment for catarrh
si convenient and effective as Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, a new internal remedy in tablet form,
composed of antiseptics like eucalyptol, guai-
8 col and blood root, which act upon the blood
end cause the elimination of the catarrhal pol-
fon frcm the system through the natural chan-
nels.
Miss Cora Alnsley, a prominent school
teacher in one of our normal schools, speaks of
her experience with catarrhal headaches and
eulogiwe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets as a cur*
lor them. She saye: "I suffered dally from
severe frontal headache and pain tn and * back
<-Â»f the eyes, at timer so intensely as to Inca-
pacitate me in my daily duties. I bad suffered
from catarrh, more or lesg, for years, but never
thought it was the causÂ» of my headaches, but
lir.ally became convinced that such was thÂ»
cat.e, because the headaches were always worse
whenever I had a cold or fresh attack of ca-
tarrh.
"Stuart's Catarrh Tablets were highly rec-
ommended to me as a safe and pleasant catarrh
cure, and after using a few flfty-cent boxes
which I rroeured from my druggist, I was sur-
prised and delighted to find that both the ca-
tarrh and headaches had gone for good."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by drug-
gists at fifty cents per package, under the
guarantee of the proprietors that they contain
absolutely no cocaine (found in so many catarrh
*'li" L '->, no opium (so common in cheap cough
"â¢fx!- r t), nor any harmful drug. They contain
simply the wholesome antiseptics necessary t<>
destroy and drive from the system the germi
*l catarrhal disease.

HOBSES IN DISPUTE
New Feature in the Suit of Aber-

a son of the late Judge Heydenfeldt. and
shortly after receiving his share of hÂ»3
father's estate he decided to become a
race horse owner. He secured the as
sistance of Gus Abercromble, and invest
ed several thousand dollars in buying rac

charge of the stable. Heydenfeldt finally
came to the conclusion that Abercromble
was not a success In his new venture and
swooped down on the stable and took
possession of the horses, Abercrombla
set up a claim of copartnership and
brought suit for an accounting.

Test Cases From the Counties of
Plumas and Sierra Are to Be
Appealed.
Two test suits brought by the counties
of Plumas and Sierra against sheep own
ers to collect a tax of 10 cents per head
on all sheep pastured in those counties
were decided yesterday In favor of the
counties by United States Circuit Judge
Morrow. The titles of the cases are Coun

and the County of Sierra against P. L.
Flanlgan. to recover $2250 and $2550 re
spectively as 10 cent head tax on sheep
belonging to tha defendants and
pastured In those counties. The
defendants defaulted so that they
might appeal the case to the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
Several months ago they Interposed de
murrers to the suits, contending that the
Bheep tax Is unconstitutional, and void
Judge Morrow overruled the demurrers
and decided that the tax was all wool and

owners, propose to carry the fight into

ALTHOUGH a "Davis cups" tennis
tournament is due the games com
mittee of California Club has de-
elded not to hold one to-morrow.
Many of the members do not take
part in tournament play and are
complaining of the difficulty in getting
the use of the courts on Sundays. The
cups will probably be played for one week
from to-morrow.
Fred Brown proved last Sunday he is
one of the best men in the first class.
Although Brown says little and looks fa
tigued throughout all his matches he
showed he is not lacking in staying pow
ers. His match with Collier was one of
the most stubbornly contested of the sea
son. Brown was not fresh when he went
into it, but he managed to win by a
small margin.
Many of the cracks are able to get out
after business hours now and the courts
present a lively appearance in the late
afternoons. ,
The tournament' for juveniles in Golden
Gate Park was a success. It was won
by Saunders, who beat Cassell in the
final. The" former received odds of "fif
teen" and won 6-3. Another tournament
similar to this one has been started. The
following boys have entered: A. McFar
land, B. Saunders, Hallerin, Page, Dodge,
Martin, O'Brien, Boericke, Riordan, Grif
fin, Largarde, B. McFarland, Marr, Cas
sell, Ayers and Ross. Marr and Griffin
are the scratch men, while the others all
receive handicaps ranging from "owe fif
teen" to "fifteen."
The students of Polytechnic High
School were much dissatisfied over the
outcome of their try-out held last week.
William Geary was conceded to. be the
best player in the school, but Horace
Mann caught him out of form and beat
him in the try-out. It was decided to let
Geary, Mann and Lilienthal, the best
three players in the school, play a round
robin tournament to determine which
would represent the school in the aca
demic championship tournament. Geary
beat Lilienthal 7-5, 6-2 and had Mann 7-5.
4-0 when the game was called on account
of rain. Geary will surely win and in all
probability his partner in doubles will
be Mann. These two men will make a
strong team.
With the Intercollegiate tournaments
only a little over a month away the col
lege men are bestirring themselves to get
into as good form as possible. Stanford's
chances are poor, but she will endeavor
to make as good a showing as possible
against the blue and gold. Harry Wiehe
stands a good chance of winning 1 onÂ£ point
for his college, but the other two will
probably go to Berkeley. Wlehe's part
ner in doubles will probably be Duval
Moore. There will be a struggle among
the Berkeley cracks to get a place on
the team. Brown, Hunt and MacGavIn
are evenly matched. The former will
probably play in one of the singles
matches and MacGavin should be given a
place on the doubles team whether he
wins in the try-out or not. He is un
questionably the best man In doubles in
college: Braly and Hendrlck would stand
a good chance of making the team, but
are giving their attention to baseball.

in the assembly hall, and on the following
day the three clubs will cruise in com

yachtsmen will take the last cruise to
Paradise Cove, returning on Sunday, Oc
tober 12. October 25 will be closing day,
and on October 26 the last club cruise of
1902 will be taken.
In the foregoing programme, which has
been prepared by Commodore R. S.
Bridgman, It will be observed there are
no dances at the clubhouse. For many
years past the San Francisco Yacht Club
has made dances a special feature, but
the directors gradually came to the con
clusion that they are expensive and do
the club little good in the estimation of
yachtsmen. Last year some of the dances
which were on the schedule were aban
doned, and it was decided this year to
substitute clambakes and sports.
The San Francisco Yacht Club is con
fronted with a serious and alarming con
dition at this time. Owing to the care
lessness of the railroad employes in hand
ling the crude oil which is used for fuel
on the locomotives the surface of the wa
ter from the << ferry slip to Hurricane
Gulch is covered with floating oil. This
renders it almost- impossible to keep a
yacht moored near the San Francisco
clubhouse, as, wherever the oil touches
the sides of a vessel, a dirty, greasy mark
is left, which, as the boat bobs up and
down and from side to side in the water,
becomes a broad band. Any halyard,
sheet or other rope that drops overboard
is covered with the same black slime,
dirtying decks, sails and clothing. If the
nuisance Is not abated it will be practi
cally Impossible to use the mooring
ground in front of the clubhouse.
The little Corinthian yacht Spider, the
speediest boat of her size in the bay, was
smashed to pieceB during the recent
storm. In the first blow ehe dragged nor
moorings and was driven against the row
of cottages on the spit near Belvedere.
Her mitHt was cut down and she was car
ried under the piles supporting the cot
tages. The next storm smashed her to
kindling wood against the piles, nothing
being left hut her lead keel, which Is iin
iÂ»< ad. (i in the sand. Several of the Co*
rinthlitn yachts In the , lagoon dragged
their moorings and were carried far up
â¢ â¢ii ttif mud flats, but can be pulled off
without Hcrtous damage*, though a good
d< al of lubur iimy bo nocemiary.
CONTRARY to expectations trap
shooting has already assumed
large proportions on this coast.
and an unusally interesting season
is expected. There Is a smaller number
of clubs in tne field and they have all
adopted the handicap system. This
equalizes the chances of the men, giving
the poorer shots a chance with the ex
perts. Â»
The officers of the Empire Gun Club
have announced this programme of
events for the which opens to
day at their Alameda Point grounds and
continues until July 13. The shoots will
be held on the second Sunday of each
month.
There are two special events, open to
all comers, one for a %'aluable repeating
shotgun, the other for the Sweeney rec
ord medal. The conditions In the former
are: Twenty birds, to be shot in ten sin
gles and five doubles, distance handicap.
The gun must be shot for five times and
becomes the property of the shooter hav
ing the highest average in this event dur
ing the season. Twenty per cent of en
trance money will go in side pool.
In addition to the Sweeney medal there
will also be a diamond medal, emblematic
of the club championship. Of the four
events scheduled three are distance hand
icaps. This system proved so satisfactory
last year that it was decided to follow it
again. Practice shooting will begin at
8:30 a. m. .
Out at Ingleside grounds the members
of Golden Gate Club will hold a shoot to
morrow, at bluerocks.
There will be a special handicap shoot
at fifty bluerocks at 1 o'clock, for one of
the Olympic Club trophies. This la open
only to former members of that organiza
tion.
Otto Feudner will leave here â¢ shortly
to take part in the Grand American
Handicap at Kansas City the latter part
of this month. There will be a six days'
shoot at live birds. Clarence Nauman is
also expected to be a competitor.
DURING the coming season there will
be only six Instead of seven clubs
in the California Cricket Assocla-
tion, the California; Club having
gone out of existence. Last year the
California Club paid its dues and was rep
resented by a delegate at the .meetings
of the association, but did not put an
eleven into the field. There will, there
fore, . be only two city clubs this year,
the Alameda and Pacific. The two Lake
County clubs, Burns Vallev and Lake
port, remain in the association, as aLÂ«o
do the Sacramento and Santa Cruz clubs.
As no matches were arranged for the
Californias last year, the schedule of the
ccming season will be made up on the
same plan" as that of last season. There
will probably be sixteen matches for the
Brown pennant, the Alameda and Pacific
teams taking part in ten each, ana the
Sacramento and Santa Cruz elevens in
six: each. The Burns Valley and Lake
port cricket clubs will arrange a schedule
between themselves, and during the year
will play a match apiece against a team
of visiting cricketers from San Fran
cisco.' â¢ The city cricketers have areaay
received an invitation from Charles M.
Hammond, captain of the Lakeport Club,
who attended the annual meeting of the
association on Monday night in San
Francisco. '
Though R. B. Hogue, for several years
captain of the Alameda Cricket Club and
first vice president of the association, has
returned to Australia, he still retains his
position as vice president; but W. S. Mc-
Gavin has retired, as the California Club
is no longer in existence. T. W. Beak
bane of the- Burns Valley Cricket Club,
which has been a consistent supporter of
the association, was chosen a vice presi
dent, as also was L. W. Robitaille of the
Sacramento- -Club. Â¦
The Santa Cruz' Country Club expects
its ground to be in better condition than
last year and to be not altogether de
nuded of grass. The club hopes to retain
Its full batting strength. The Santa Cruz
men wish to make only one trip to San
Francisco this year, and would like to
make that during the Independence day
holdings, playing against the Alameda
team one day and against the Pacific
eleven on the next day. They suggest
the return matches be played at Santa
Cruz in August.
The Burns Valley Cricket Club of Lake
County held its annual meeting on Wash
ington's birthday and elected the follow
ing officers: H. P. H. Haggett, president;
W. S. Bayton, captain; T. W. Beakban*.

COURSING at Union Park to-day and
to-morrow will be in the nature of a
continuous performance. There are
four different events on the card,
calling for 110 courses.
The public always enjoys a match race
of any kir.d where two animals of equal
ability are to meet and struggle for su
premacy. For the first time in many
months the followers of coursing are to
see such a competition. The contending
greyhounds will be Sisquoc, winner of the
California Plate two weeks since, and
Sacramento Boy. The latter was believed
to have the rich stake at his mercy, but
through an oversight his name was
omitted from the list of entries.
These two greyhounds are conceded to
be the best now in training, each having
defeated Beacon under almost identical
conditions. Opinion is almost equally di
vided as to which will lead to the hare.
The same condition obtains as to the
working ability of the dogs. This differ
ence ot opinion is expected to result in
some heavy wagering on the outcome of
tne match.
Sisqucc will be "on the white" in the
first course, which is considered by some a
slight advantage. It is believed tne hares
usually bear to the right slightly, thus fa
voring the dog which starts from the
"slips ' on that side.
Fred Darling has imported two grey
hounds, which are expected to cut quite
a figure here some day. One is a black
dog called Gambit, whelped in April, 1900,
and weighing fifty-eight pounds. He is
by Gallant-Jennie Milburn and is a full
brother to Red Angus, but of a later lit
ter. He arrived in splendid condition and
will be ready to go to the slips in three
weeks.
The other is black and white- and was
whelped in May, 1900. She is by Under the
Globe-Gadder. It will be some time be
fore she can be coursed, as she arrived in
poor condition. Both are well bred. They
will be handled by Joe Trade.
The sale of D. J. Healey's kennel of
greyhounds to Ralph Orthwein of St.
Louis has been completed. Eight young
dogs have been shipped in crates to their
new owner, while those in training will
be forwarded next week. The latter in
clude SisQUOC, Elista. Tiburon, Tapioca,
Fine Form and Lady Clare. In the opin
ion of coursing men the five puppies by
Fortuna Favente-Wave are worth the
price obtained for the entire kennel.
Wave is the dam of some of the greatest
performers in California. She is eight
years old. Among her progeny are Luxor,
Young America, Candelaria, Forest
King, Forest Queen. O'Hara, Sisquoc,
Olita, Ripple, Lady Granard and others.
Mr. Healey bred Sisquoc to For Glory
before parting with him.
Fury was mated with the English dog
Overture some weeks since.
Rocker and Little Wonder have been
mated. Little Wonder produced White
head and Ruby R. by "Waratah; Hickory
Dick and Red Rock, by Rochester; Daisy
D and Pocotala, by Emln Pasha. Rocker
is one of the best representatives of .Sky
Rocket.
A. R. Curtis has two puppies by Vulcan-
Maud S. They were closely inbred, so the
remainder of the litter was destroyed.
T. J. Cronin's Thornhill, once a well
known performer on the local fields,
picked up poison in the country recently
and died.

not very far from San Francisco.
In what direction Seymour went Chief

BERKELEY, March 7.â An unusually
short track season has fallen to the lot
of the University of. California athletes
this term. Rain has kept the men from
much necessary work, and although but
about thirty days remain before the inter
collegiate meet the men have not been
able to have regular practice. They have
worked faithfully when they could and
this has kept them up physically. Fortu
nately tho athletes are', as a whole, in
unusually good condition considering the
amount of practice they have had, and
this brightens what, under other circum
stances, would be rather a dark outlook
for the eeason.
The Eugenes have won the team con
test in the tournament of the San Fran
cisco Bowling Association, which has
been in progress since January. The
members of the team won seventeen
games and lost one. The San Pranciscos
won ten and lost five. The Lincolns won
twelve and lost six. Tho games last night
resulted as follows:
The articles of Incorporation were filed
yesterday In the County Clerk's office in
tho name of the Coliseum Building Com

articles were tiled by Herbert ChoynsUl,
attorney for the company, and one of the
incorporators and stockholders,

The building will have a wide scope of
use, being available for conventions, the
circus, boxing matches and fairs. The
seats will be portable and can be changed
according to the character of the enter

It will be in the form of an am
phitheater and will seat 12,000 people, al
lowing each one an unobstructed view of
whatever may be taking place on the
platform in the center of the building.
The alte has already been selected in a
desirable location, easy of access by sev

A MONSTER coliseum has been

Tho belief In God means the acceptance of
the divine principle. God is the law of the
universe from whom all things sprung and to
whom all things will return. To believe in
God Is one thing, but to believe In the Bible
Is quite another. ThÂ» Bible is sacred. It u
the political and moral constitution of the
world, It Is eternal because It comes from
Ood. The Bible represents the Moaalo law,
the poetry of Israel. Its destiny is not that
Intended by its authors. It was never Intended
tlpt It fhould become a firebrand in the Â«ehuo)a
of the theologians, U was never Intended to
bring discord Jpio the world as jt did through.
OUt Ilia Hfc.H. The IliLle (a |p Israel a civc

thÂ» Bible means tha concreta attitude toward

No question la so interesting as the general
interrogation, what does belief In the Bible
really mean? Belief is a broad word. It is
like an ample garment In the folds of which
one may hide himself. What do people mean
when they Bay, I believe? One cannot solve
the mysteries of creation, one cannot define
life. God is a quantity in human faith aa
well as a quality. Everything about us is
life â the dewdrop and glacier, the atom and
the sun. We know all this la life and without
being able to define It we may believe. With
out being able to define the term God, there
fore, one is justified In believing that Gotl
exists.
Rev. Jacob Voorsanger delivered an In
teresting lecture at the Temple Emanu
Â£1 last night, his theme being the various
attitudes toward the Bible as an Inspired
work. He defined the different positions
assumed by theologians and laymen con
cerning the Bible, saying in part:

PERSONAL MENTION.
My clients In the past have always made
individual i oath to the statements filed with
you. and have in many j instances been per
sonally examined^ thereto, but the words In
your letter, "principals oaiy," would imply
that 'it is your Intention to debar, a taxpayer
from : : having the '. benefit of 'the advice of. his.
accountant or attorney when requested to at
tend a "star chamber inquiry" at your office.
It Is open to question whether the law confers
on you ; any such .. power, and I am perfectly
.willing -to make a test case of your own se-'
lection, providing my. client will submit to tht
notoriety and annoyance. As 'Â¦. well might the
Colle'ctorof this port, who attends to the Fed-_
eral revenues,! object to a custom-house agent'
making an, entry, of goods on behalf -of hto"
client. .
â¢ >An eminent writer in a recent magazine
says: "There Is , no need to state In words
that harm may result : If a*, public officer is
permitted to make his own laws and rules'
for the transaction of public business under
his charge." ;â¢ â¢
Now a word or two as to the methods adopt-
\The concluding sentence of your brief and In
solent letter states you have "established a rule
thfs year to 'have intercourse yrlth, principals
only." So far as. this, applies to making a
-sworn statement of "property, it conforms to ar
ticle VI of ths" rules, and 'regulations of the
State Board of Equalization, which reads: "As
sessors must not accept returns or statements
from . asents â¢ for Â¦ ', persons, - when the persons
themselves can be found in the county."
Replying to the, first. paragraph of your very
discourteous note, 1 will dismiss It by saying
It is 'practically untrue. Invariably my serv
ices are required, through personal acquaint
ance client's recommendation, or bankers' ref
erence; and even If It werd true, do you know
of any law prohibiting' the professional. employ,
ment of an accountant's services In correctly
listing assessable property?
Thanking you for your unrequlred, unsolicited

Asseasor vWashington Dodges and Alfred
G. Platt have locked horns In a quarrel
which is of timely and Intense Interest
to tho financial and business communities
and to- taxpayers generally. Each of tha
disputants possesses tho faculty of sar
castic retort, ns the following contribution
to tho controversy by Mr. Platt will at
test:
BAN FltANClSCO, March T, 1002.
If you are (as you claim) exceedingly desir
ous of relieving the small taxpayer of a pro
portion of his taxes and increasing the assess
ments of tho wealthier class, let me ask you
why you did not place on the assessment roll
personal property to the extent of several mil
lion dollars belonging to the estates of deced-
, I grant you that a large amount of personal
property escapes assessment, which rightfully
should be assessed, and in* this connection I
quote from article XXIX. wherein the State
Board"of Equalization instruct Assessors to
personally attend to supervising and fixing the
different valuations, but I beg to suggest this
cannot, be done by giving only, a few hounÂ»* at
tendance of each day during the months from
March to June of each year.
It may be taken for granted that most'mer
chants are altogether too much occupied with
their dally business affairs to make a study of
the revenue laws affecting their Interests, but
the law does not contemplate that they shall
suffer thereby, consequently It Is optional with
them to engage competent professional advice
If they choose so to do, especially as the requi
site information as to their legal rights and
offsets is not vouchsafed to them through your
office. â¢ \
While I contend that you, InVour official ca
pacity, have no authority to dictate what my
business shall be, or how I shall employ my
time as a private clUzen. It is altogether a dif
ferent matter with yoiwgelf. ajnee you have
been elected to a public ptflce/ .' ;
And while on the subject of solvent credit*,
allow me to call your attention to article XI
supra, which nays: "In the case of unsecured
credits the same should be assessed at thei(
reul value, which may, In many Instance*,
he less than their par .value." Ignoring this
Instruction the method adopted by you, as
Assessor, Is to have stated the gross amount
of credits, deducting therefrom the l*>na fide
debts, : owing to residents of this State, and
assess, the balance; whereas, you are told'asseus
the solvent credits at their real (not book)
value, and deduct therefrom the debts as afore
said. . Th<fs makes a vital difference in favor
of the taxpayer, a fact of which you are doubt
less well aware. â¢ ".>,

ed by you In making assessments of personal
property. I am aware you have often stated
to several merchants that by complying with
your subpoena and attending alone, in proprla
persona, they will receive from you fair and
Impartial/ treatment, but results, I regret to
say, . do not bear out your statement. .Your
duties In assessing property are ministerial
only, and I would ask If you, or your depu
ties, have ever informed a merchant Importer
of his legal rights In regard to merchandise

One other matter In conclusion: When I
was engaged in an advisory capacity to the
Committee on Personal Property Assessments
during the year I.sski. I showed you an advance
copy of my report, which I subsequently filed
with the Board of Supervisors. This cour
tesy I extended to* you for your personal Infor

covered that you maile use of it (without per

should be done.
Contribution to a Controversy Which Is of Timely Interest to the Financial and the Busi

Concerning the effect of the climate the review
says:. "The average elevation of the central plateau
is about. 6000 feet above the level' of the sea, Mexico
itself being at a height of 7444 feet. At that eleva
tion the barometric pressure is very much reduced,
the air is quite rarefied and the amount of oxygen
contained in a giveri:;measure of v air: is. considerably r
reduced." The effect of this reduced breathing in of
oxygen in the case of both men' and lower animals' is
to be observed in a lessened activity and a reduction
of ability to perform work of any sort. . * * * With
out discussing the exact extent to which the corporal
powers are lessened by the reduced amount,of.oxy
gen in the air, it suffices to state that the effect of this
condition in producing indolence is very great and '
is felt by foreigners who go to Mexico to live as well
as by those to the manner borri.".* : .
The greatest drawback to the .value pf labor in
Mexico, however, is its unreliability, and^that pro-
ceeds not so much from a natural indolence result
ing from the climate as from the mental traits of im
providence, carelessness and ,a.' lack- of ambition. In
fact, despite the lack of oxygen in the air of .the
central plateau, the Mexican is capable of a large
amount of work when roused to it. Thus Humboldt
has given many examples of the endurance of Mexi
cans working in the mines, and in everything tfiat
Viewing the people from the standpoint of labor it
i<Â« noted that. their most salk-nt characteristic is
apathy. This constitutional indolence isjattributcd
to a variety of causes, among which are the high
elevation at which most of the people'^ live, the lack
of -severe .winters, bad social and economic condi
tions, malnutrition, the large consumption of alcohol
and tobacco, contentment with a low level of life,
improvidence, and an excessive number of holidays,
which encourage the people to neglect their work
for idleness and gambling.
The total population .according to the census of
1900 was 13,545,462. There is reason to believe, how
ever, that the count was not accurate among the In
dians and that the real number of the inhabitants of
the country canriot.be less than 15,000,060. Fully 75
per cent of .the whole live in the high plateau in the
central portion of the Country, and that fact has a
good deal to do with the labor problem. Since 1875
no attempt has been made to classify the people ac
cording to races, and consequently, no exact figures
are available as to the proportions of Spanish, In
dian and mixed races, but in that year the whites
constituted 20 per, cent, the Indians 37 per cent and
the mixed races 43 per cent. There has been a
steady increase in the prpportioti of mixed races
evcr ( since 1810, and it is fair to assume that at pres
ent those races constitute a majority of the popula
tion. . /
LABOR conditions in Mexicb are carefully re
viewed in the January bulletin of the Depart
ment 'of : Labor at Washington by Professor
Wcyl of the University of Pennsylvania. The study
is the more interesting because of the peculiar char
acteristics of the Mexican population, which is now
developing into a thoroughly mixed race of Spanish
and Indian. - j

Â¦ Legislative work is going on very well in the
East. New. York has prohibited pigeon-shooting
matches, Massachusetts is going to require a citizen
to take out a license before he can Jtcep a cat, and
New Jersey has passed a bill for the extermination of
mosquitoes; and it looks as if earnest efforts were
under way all along the line to make the East a

In view of the promise of Marconi there has nat
tirally been a good deal of discussion concerning the
probable effect of the rrew system as a competitor
of telegraphy by wire. Until": great improvements
have been" made in transmitting and receiving by the
Marconi method the old system will continue to have
advantage by reason of the greatly superior, rapidity
of its work.' Some erthorities hold that for a long
time to come the main usefulness of wireless *eleg
raphj' will be in communicating with ships at sea,
and that the land business and the bulk of commer
cial business across the ocean will' go by wire.- It
appears, therefore, that, swift as has been the advance
of wireless telegraphy since the day when The Call
;firsf applied it to the practical use of transmitting
the news of the arrival of the transport bringing
home the California Volunteers from Manila, it is
not going to work a sudden revolution in business.
Whatever change it is to bring about -will come
slowly. . . . ,
It will be seen from these facts that Marconi's
promise to have wireless telegraphy ready for com
mercial business within three < months is by no means
an idle boan. He ha* proven the ability of his sys
tem to fccr.d message* readable at a distance of more
'than '1500 miles, ani to increase the distance it is
merely ncccsiary to increase the power at the trans
mitting station. Modern methods of generating
electricity will enable him to obtain the increased
power with comparatively little difficulty. It is only
a question of coin, and in the present state of the per
fection of his system he will have no trouble in get
ting all the financial backing he needs. Indeed, the
fclockholdcrs and directors of his company appear to
be even more enthusiastic than himself. One of
them who crossed the ocean with him said: "We are
prepared to meet any one who may dispute our
claims on this trip and are prepared to confront him
with incontrovertible proof of what has been done."
The New York Press publishes a fac-simile of the
tape containing the tost signals received. It is
j-ipned by A. R. Mills, captain of the Philadelphia.
It is made up of a series of dashes, of which the first
three are perfect, and give clearly the "S" of the
Morrc code. The others practically mean nothing
beyond the fact that they are unreadable, indefinite
tignals made by electricity. It is to be noted that
the distance from the Poldhu station in Cornwall to
the station in Newfoundland is but 2080 miles, so
that the Philadelphia signals covered a greater dis
tance than those first sent across the ocean.
The statement was given with positiveness on the
itrcnKth of successful tests made during the voyage
of the Philadelphia across the sea. These tests were far
more thorough than that by-which the first signal was
received across the ocean Jast December, and the re
bults were far better. In fact, they leave apparently
no r6om for further doubt or skepticism on the part
.of the least credulous. The statements concerning
i hem rest not upon Marconi's observations only, but
are corroborated by the recording tape on the ship
End by the officers in command. These bear witness
to the fact that at a distance of 1551^ miles from the
sending station in Cornwall there were received on
â¢the Philadelphia the clearly distinguishable .words,
"All in order here." Beyond that distance the mes
.'sages became unintelligible, but signals continued to
be received until the ship reached a distance from the
station of 2009 miles.
MARCONI on his recent arrival in New York
told the members of the press who inter
viewed him: "In about three months we
s>hall be transacting commercial business between
England and America â that is, transmitting messages
of any kind between Cornwall and Cape Breton. Of
â¢course we will be competing with the cable compa
i.ics and they will not like it. There is no longer
any possible doubt about the practicability of the in
vention for trans-Atlantic business."

A. G. PLATT MAKES CERTAIN CAUSTIC CRITICISMS
OF ASSESSOR DODGE'S POLICY AND PUBLIC DUTY
WHEN the grandfather of
Thomas 0. Gentry, supervising
principal of the U. S.. Grant
School of PhtlO-dclnhln, was n
young benedict, living near
llolmpsburg, people determined the tlmo
of duy largely from the sun's position.
A notch on the door Jumb, across which
would fall a shadow on clear days, Indi
cated the hour of high noon. Clocks were
luxuries, and luxuries were known to but
few homes.
Ono day a Yankee peddler, with an
amazing array of clocks In his wagon,
Induced Grandfather Gentry to tako ono
on trial.
This clock, with Us machinery of wood,
now occupies an honored place In the,
homo of Professor Gentry. Its correct
ness in Indicating,.- timo equals many of
tho best of modern make.
But Gentry has not allowed that old
grandfather's clock to suffice ' him. No
doubt with the trite saying, "Time Is
money," In mind, he has continued buy
ing, until now he has 225 clocks In his
home. They are of u.ll sorts and sizes,
ycung clocks and very old ones, native
and foreign.
Professor Gentry is not a "crank" ex
cept on clocks. As an author of several
books, chiefly on bird life, and as a col
lector of minerals, ho is well known
among specialists. 'One of his . â¢ works*.
"Nests and Eggs of Birds of the United
States," has sixty-two colored plates.

To Califorrtians it may ecem strange that .issues of
this kind have to be argued over time after time. It
is, however, not easy to educate publip opinion on a
subject to which it is comparatively indifferent. Cam
paigns of popular education arc always long and
sometimes tiresome. This one, however,, is going
forward at' last with' gratifying 1 speed. Indeed it is
not improbable that the irrigation bill may be passed
by the/present; Congress's./, '['<.,>Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦''> ; â¢. ,
Noting the Eastern objection to voting money out
of the national treasury for the enterprise, Mr. New
lands says the bill now pending before Congress pro
vides for establishing an arid-land reclamation fund
out of the receipts from sales of lands in the arid re
gion, . and adds: "In this way a revolving fund
is created out of the sale of the .lands reclaimed,
which is applied to new"work,and thus, in the end,
the West will reclaim itself. The Secretary of the In
terior can make no contract for irrigation works un
less the moneys therefor are in thd fund. Thus the
arid region will be reclaimed without taxation of the
general public." /
One of the points upon- which the Eastern people
most need enlightenment is" that relating to the effect,
the opening up of the ncWarea .'for home-seekers will
have upon Eastern â¢farrfteVs.:*Over : and over again it
has been said that the irrigation of arid lands will
serve no other purpose than that , of ; encouraging
competition to the East and injuring Eastern landed
interests. Upon that issue Mr. Newlands says: "It
might as well be contended that the people of the
original thirteen States suffered from Western de
velopment as that_,the eighty, millions of people now
occupying this country wilf suffer from the develop
ment of the arid region.' The arid 'region will simply
furnish a market for Eastern. manufactures' and East
ern products. It will not^c'orripcte with' the' Eastern
or Middle Western farms, .because, in the northern
part of the arid region cultivation will be confined
almost entirely to alfalfa, wfyich is very useful in the
fattening of cattle, and in the southern region culti
vation will be confined largely to the citrus fruits and
other products of a ; semi-tropical character.' It has
only to be. borne in mind that the' entire, area capable
of reclamation does not exceed 60,000,000 acres, and
that this area will only equal the' area of the two
States of Idwa and Illinois. If a nation of a few
millions of people did not suffer from the develop
ment of Iowa and Illinois, how can it be contended
for a moment that a country with 80,000,000 of peo
ple can suffer from the development of the arid re
gion?" 'i-s^S '':.Â¦ ' Â¦ "''Â¦' '-'\-
REPRESENTATIVE NEWLANDS of Nev
ada has contributed- to the New York^Timcs .,
an instructive article on "Irrigation in the â¢
West," which will doubtless have a good effect in
educating Eastern public opinion on the subject. Mr.
Newlands, from his leng service in Washington, is
familiar with objections made- by Eastern Represen
tatives to the policy of irrigation, and he is therefore
able to direct hit argument especially to this points
on which the JSnst needs enlightenment. In that re

these small holdings in statements signed by their

other of 40 acres' $4000; another of Go acres, which
its owner started with only $400 is valued
now at $13,000, and though not all in action nets
$3500 per year. Hundreds of such cases arc cited and
of course represent thousands of others that are not
given. Similar opportunities await the industrious
immigrant to the Sacramento and San Joaquin val
leys all over this northern region, and if made known
will soon bring it up to the results achieved by en

*ccn in passing through Placer from Rocklin to. Col
fax, where the small holdings lie on both sides oi the
railroad, cultivated in the most beautiful and fruitful
orchards nnd vineyards in the world, each supporting
a family under the finest of climatic and productive

farm intensively, and its returns are abundant.
An examination of the daily record of temperature

â¢'â¢ 'As far as the Sacramento Valley is concerned there

Valencia' street since February 27, was "lo
cated yesterday' by a Call reporter at the
home of her friend, Miss Jennie Torrey,
657 Linden street, Oakland. The girl was
surprised. into admitting her identity, and
subsequently explained that she had left
home because sne had some trouble with
her mother.' She said her home Â¦was not
pleasant and she preferred to live in Oak
land, where she expects to obtain employ
ment Monday.
When Miss Bennett left home she told
her mother she was going to the United
States laundry in search of work. Later
in xhe day her- mother received a letter
signed with her daughter's name, stating
that she' hact gone to Oakland and was
working for .the Hickmott Can Company.
The fact â¢ that the letter was not in her
daughter's handwriting aroused Mrs. Ben
nett'd suspicions and she sent a friend of
the tanilly to Oakland to bring the girl
home.. He -was told at the Hickmott Can
Companyts establishment that there was
no such person employed there and at the
Torrey residence he was told that Miss
Bennett 'haa" not been there. This latter
statement has now been disproved.
Thoroughly ''alarmed and fearful that
her daughter might have met a fate sim
ilar to that, of Nora Fuller, Mrs. Bennett
notified the police, who have. been search
ing for the- girl for several days past.
Miss Bennett said she would pay her

children, told the court that Shayer- had
only paid her $5 since she secured her di
vorce in June last. Â¦ Shayer, who has
taken unto himself a second wife, was

court that a speedy amending of his ways
would save him from considerable bother

Other Wives Make Complaint.
Artemesia Beban, who was married to
Lewis Beban in 1892 filed a suit for. di
vorce yesterday. She alleges that her
husband deserted her March 17, 1900, and
that since that time he has failed to pro
vide for her. Beban, his wife alleges,
earns a salary of $130 per month, and can
easily spare her $30 of that sum for the
support of herself and minor child.
White wanted a young wife, and perused
the columns of a matrimonial paper to
find one that would suit him. There he
saw the advertisement of Louise Bogan, a
pretty stenographer, residing on Tehama
street. He told the spirits he had at last
found his divinity. The "spirits" con
ferred and informed him that they were
satisfied with his choice. White, though
an old man, is not a laggard in love' af
fairs, and after receiving the consent of
the spirits he hastened to Miss Bogan' s
address and the marriage followed. The
wedding took place in February, 1898, and
after a honeymoon trip to Mexico, White
seemed to forget all about his friends of
the other world, and Mrs. White, for a
time, was happy.
Last year his yearning for "communion"
with the spirits returned and he. sought
them, or their earthly representatives.
His wife objected strenuously, but he
persisted and finally left her in Decem
ber of last year. Mrs. White then deter
mined to sue for divorce. .
"Wanted a Young Wife.
The plaintiff, who is about half the age
of her nuaband, says tnat the show of
"amatory anu affectionate regard" dis
played by White and the medium at their
intercommunions was disgusting, and eo
preyed lipon her feelings that she suf
iered "great mental anguish."'
Mrs. White estimates tnat her, husband
is worth $50,000, and says that he is well
able to make a liberal allowance for her
support Â¦ . , ,
'rhis is White's second matrimonial
venture, and like the first it is a failure.
The first wife procured a divorce after
a sensational suit several years ago, and
one-half -of White's property went with
the decree. He still nas enough wealth,
however, to hold a place. among the eli
gibles. The spirits had a great deal .to do
with the union which Mrs. White says
they are now breaking up. ' - â¢. Â¦
WJiite, after being divorced, spent a
great deal of his time with a Stockton
street medium. The spirits advised- him
to marry again. The description of the
bride-to-be tallied with that of the me
dium. White was perfectly willing to
marry, but the description of his prospect
ive better-half did not suit. him.
Says Medium Is Affectionate.
If George D. White, the cattle lefng,
would only .keep away from a certain
spiritualistic medium his wife, Louisa,
would be a contented woman, but unfor
tunately he seems to have a penchant for
things unearthly. For relief from her
troubles Mrs. White has sought the aid
of the divorce courts. She filed a com
plaint yesterday containing a long tirade
against "White and a certain woman,
Mrs. White terms a spiritualist. She al
leges that her husband will not live in
a houfse without -a spirituaiist, and,
strange to relate, the representative of

for letters of administration upon the es
tate, Richard O' Neil, who, with Bliss,
was' named as executor, having waived
his right tOi serve. The deceased left an
estate, worth upward of $1,000,000, almost

provision:
If my Bald daughter, Mrs. Hermann, shall
cease to be the wife of said George Hermann,
before her death, then and in that event the
property embraced In said trust shall vest In
fee simple absolute to my said daugther.
To his sons, George D. Bliss Jr., . and
Richard O. Bliss, he leaves the Merced

CLEVER VIOLINIST GIVES
A. STJCCESSFTJL CONCEET
Miss Leonora Jackson Is Heard
Again After an Absence of More
Than a Year.
Leonora Jackson, the violinist, was
heard again last night at Metropolitan
Temple, after a year's absence. Only a
small house greeted Miss Jackson and
her associates, though the violinist is
much better worth hearing than she was
a year ago. She played charmingly last
night. She has gained largely in
breadth and sympathy and gave a ren
dering of the Vieuxtemps D minor Con
certo that had a veritable dramatic ac
cent. Her tone, always large, is warmer,
and she has a delightful violin that shows
to prettiest advantage Miss Jackson's
lirm and graceful technique.
Miss Jackson is assisted this time by
Mr. Bauer, pianist, and Harry J. Fellows,
tenor. Mr. Bauer accompanies with
credit to himself and pleasure to the au
dience, but as a soloist is not remarkable.
Mr. Fellows would sing well if he had a
better voice, his little Irish song, encore
to the Gomez "Boat Song," being pleas
rntly and competently sung. The pro
gramme Included the following numbers:
Polonaise from "Le Bal"; Boat Sons from
Opera "Sal vat or Rosa." Mr. Fellows; Concert
No. 4, D minor (by request) (Vleuxtemps), (a)
Introduction and Cadenza. (b)Adagio Heligloso,

A WOMAN TO BE PRETTY
Must Have Luxuriant and Glossy
Hair, No Matter What Color.
The fln^t contour of a female face, the
sweetest smile of a female mouth, loses
something if the head is crowned with
scant hair. Scant and falling hair, it is
now known, is caused by a parasite that
burrows into the scalp to the root of the
hair, where it saps the vitality. The. little
white scales the germ throws up in bur-
rowing are called dandruff. To cure dan-
druff permanently, then, and to stop fall-
ing hair, that germ must be killed. New-
bro's HerpicWe. an entirely new result of
the chemical laboratory, destroys the dan-
druff germ, and. of course, stops the fall-
ing hair and cures baldness.

I have been over these two sections
very carefully with the Attorney General
and their construction seems to be per
fectly clear. You will please inform the
Director of the Census that his office
will continue to be administered as it
has been administered until the 1st of
July. On that day he will, with your
permission, appoint such members of the
present force under him as will consti
tute the permanent census force, appoint
ing only so many as are to be perma
nently employed. After that date all ap
pointments will be madeUinder the regu
lations of the civil service act. Very
truly yours,
THEODORE ROOSEVELT,
E. A. HITCHCOCK,
Secretary of the Interior.
In the first place, from the present em
ployes of the Census Office; and, in the
second place, all new appointments to be
made in accordance with the civil service
law. After any of the present employes
of the Census Office have been appointed
upon the permanent force they become
part of the classified service.
WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON. D.
C, March G, 1902.â Sir: I have signed the
act providing for a permanent Census
Bureau. Section 2 of this act provides
that the work pertaining to the twelfth
census shall be carried on by the Census
Office under the existing organization un
til the first day of July, when the perma
nent Census Office herein provided for
shall be organized by the Director of the
Census. Section 5 provides that with your
approval the Director of the Census may
appoint the permanent census force in
two ways:
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The Presi
dent has signed the bill creating a per
manent Census Bureau, and he has sent
the following letter to the Secretary of
the Interior:
On motion of Hale of Maine the Senate
then began the consideration of the dip
lomatic and consular appropriation bill
The bill was read. It carries in round
figures $2,000,003 in appropriations. Bacon
of Georgia offered an amendment provid
in? that tjie student Interpreters employed
in the legations and consulates in China
should be selected in a non-partisjin man-
Mr and that they should agree to remain

A joint resolution asking the President
to invite the Government of Canada to
join in the formation of an international
commission to examine and report on the
diversion of the ! waters that are tha
boundaries of the two countries was re
ported favorably from the Committee on
Commerce. Hoar of Massachusetts urged
that the matter ought to be considered
by the Foreign Relations Committee as
it opened "a very important and very del.
icaie question." fnvolving diplomatic pro.
cedure. On his motion it was referred to
the Committee on Foreign Relations
A resolution offered by Harris of Kan-
Bas directing the Committee on Indian
Affairs to investigate the matter of the
removal of certain Creek Indians from
the lands assigned to them and to renort
by bill or otherwise was adopted *""**â¢
The Senate agreed to a conference with
the House upon the bill providing for the
redemption of certain internal revenue
ftamps and Aldrich of Rhode Island
Platt of Connecticut and Teller of ColoÂ»
rado were named as conferees on the Dart
cf the Senate.
Bacon denied the constitutionality of
any law which shall invade our institu
tions, which Ehall upturn the recognized
procedures of a hundred years and which
shall put It in the power .of partisans
either on the bench or elsewhere, Â¦ to op
pose men on account of political opin
ions. The blil if enacted, he said, would
muzzle the press and make every editor
afraid to express an opinion as to the
President or any other official for fear
that, thereafter, If any of these officials
should be killed, he might be tried for
murder. He would not. ne said, vote for
the bill even if he were the only man in
the Benate and in the House of Repre
sentatives opposed to It.
At 2 o'clock the unfinished business of
the ship subsidy bill was laid before the
benate. Inquiry by Frye developed th<>
tact that Vest and Maliory who had ex.
pected to speak on the bill to-day wert
retained by illness. The measure was
laid aside informally and consideration
of the bill for the protection of the j-res
ident was resumed.
he indicated his belief that such a pro
vision was unconstitutional, maintaining
that treason had been denned in the con
stitution only after long and careful de
bate, during which every possible con
tingency was considered. He argued that
the constitution intended that each man
Khali be equal before the law, and said
the remedy for an attack on the Presi
dent or the killing of the President
snould be the same as If the crime were
committed against an individual.
WASHINGTON, March 7.â The Senate
to-day resumed consideration of the bill
providing for the protection of the Presi
dent of the United States. Continuing
his speech begun yesterday Bacon con
tended that the enactment of the bill in
its present form would be an extension
of treason as denned by the authorities.
He yuoted various writers on the consti
tution in support of his argument. Mere
ly because the crime named in the pend
ing bill waa not designated as treason
did not change its character. It prac
tically was made treason by the penalty
provided and the means resorted to 10
apply the penalty to the> criminal.

SHORTAGE OF WATER
SOUTH OF TEHACHAPI
Overseer Pressell Predicts That There
Will Not Be Sufficient for
Irrigation.
LOS ANGELES, March 7.â "There is
likely to be a great shortage of water
for irrigation during the coming season,"
says George D. Pressell, the water over
seer. "The rainfall this season has been
even less than the average during the
recent dry seasons and the measures in
course of formulation for increasing the
capacity of the municipal works have not
been undertaken any too soon.
"There has been little snow this win
ter. Ordinarily, when we see a heavy
downfall of snow In the Tejunga Basin:
we feel that there is to be plenty of
water. When that is missing there is
danger of a shortage. The continued dry
years have drained the mountains, and,
while the recent heavy rains must have
benefited the situation, not nearly enough
has come to afford .much hope of the
needed supply during the â¢ summer
months." . Â¦

REDWOOD CITY, March 7.â William
Scheper, a young man 19 years old, met
death some time last night between San
Mateo and Burlingame by being run over
by a train. The body was discovered this
morning by the foreman of a. section
gang. It had been cut in two by the
wheels of a passing train. Coroner Crow
was notified and brought the body to the
morgue at this place. The young man's
name and address were found upon a
card on his person and in response to a
telegram Fred Scheper, a brother, came
from San Francisco and identilled the
body. '
According to the story of the brother
William Scheper was at home in San
Francisco last night at 210% Clipper
street, between 7:30 and 8 o'clock. This
morning at 7 o'clock a young man came
to the house and told the mother that
William had fallen off a train, but was
not killed. He afterward admitted that
the boy was killed. How he knew this
fact,Â»Â»unless he was with Scheper at the
time, is unexplained.
William Scheper, who was only 19 years
of age, was a teamster, and for some
time worked for Farnsworth & Ruggles,
draymen, in San Francisco. He quit the
firm's* employ about three months ago,
eince which time he has been doing odd
jobs. He had two chums, both young
men of about his own age. named Kreig
and Walsh, and was almost continually in
their company. It was one of these who
gave the family the information this
morning.
Just what connection they had with the
affair wid just how much they know
about it, will not be known until the in
quest is held next Monday. One of them
took to the Clipper street house a piece
of baling rope which, he said, Scheper
had been tied to a car with and which
broke. How they came to have the piece
of rope is another mystery.
As soon as Coroner Crow heard the
brother's story he sent for Sheriff Mans
field, as he believed there were facts that
should be investigated by the Sheriff's
office. Subpenas have been Issued for
Kreig and Walsh and sent to San Fran
cisco for service, requiring their presence
at the inauest.

Business as well as social life of today is one of strain and effort, and tho
struggle for existence in competition makes life a fight day in day'out, in which
care 'of body, nerves, blood is mgre or less neglected. Men wonder what's
wrong with them.' No man can stand such unnatural conditions unless ho
counteracts them by using Cascarets Candy Cathartic, causing regularity of

"Scherzo" was also handled gracefully
and with a noticeable technical ease. The
beautiful "March" went well, perhaps too
Iclaurely, loose, in its tempo, and the first
movement, . in places delightfully played,
as a whole lacked a little in grip and
eplrit.
As a complete contrast, the Wagner
overture to the "Flying Dutchman" fol
lowed the pymphony, and with startling
effect. Thfi picturesque number was
splendidly played and brought vivid
memories of the wonderful Vandcrdecken
of Blspham and Gadski's noble Senta,
with its haunting themes and stormy
color. Of the daintlent of dainty things
were the two small numbers for string or
chestra that followed the first, a Norwe
gian "Volksmelodle," by Johann Svend
fscn, Just the merest summer murmur,
with a Bong crooning lazily through it;
the second a captivating "Serenade, " by

clever, queer, rather grotesque affair,
closed tho programme and the season.
"Finale" went beautifully, with ease,
close accord, spirit and precision, its
varying character treated with grateful
plasticity and full sympathy. The

VANCOUVER, B. C, March 7.â Two
terrible accidents by burning, one result

injuries, occurred to-day in the vicinity
of Vancouver. A little girl named Fran

parents live at Granite Creek. She was
playing in the kitchen, when her mother
happened to go out for a moment. The
child had apparently been climbinft over
chairs and slipping from one of these she
fell into a huge kettle of boiling water.
The little one slowly boiled to death. In
a few minutes her screams attracted her
mother, who snatched the child out of the
water. The little girl was dead within a
few minutes. Â¦ â¢

that irrigation long ago passed the ex

In conclusion, we desire to express our
thanks to you personally, aa Mayor of this city,
to the Hon. R. H. "Webster, Superintendent
of Schools, and the Honorable Board of Edu
cation, for recognizing our school, by giving it
prominence as an independent commercial
school.
To us, as pupils of the commercial school,
it haa always seemed an injustice to attach
us to a grammar Echool, especially every one
who enters that school must be a graduate
from a grammar echool or high school before
he can do so. To receive a diploma after we
have spent from one and a haif to two years
in that school, stating that we graduated
irom a department of a grammar school, it is
to say the least misleading and an injustice.
"When the good news was received that tho
commercial' school had been made an inde
pendent commercial school, both teachers and
pupils . were delighted. This happiness . was,
however, marred to some extent, when on
reading an evening paper, certain strictures
were made upon Principal Murphy by a mem
ber of the Board of Education. This appears
to us an injustice, in view of the fact that
this school has never been honored with a
visit from that official. Those of us who daily
come in touch with our principal entertain al
together a different opinion and have the full
est confidence in his ability to make this
school equal to any of the kind in the United
States.
To the Hon. E. E. Schmltz, Mayor; Hon. R.
H. Webster, Superintendent of Schools, and
to the Hon. Board of Education â Gentlemen:
On behalf of the pupils of the ' commercial
school just established, we, a committee of the
pupils of the school, appear before you to ex
press our sincere thanks and deep gratitude
to you in helping ub in obtaining an independ
ent school. During the present year there has
been enrolled G50 pupils ! in the commercial
f.chool, all of whom aro graduates of a gram
mar or high school. Of this number more
tl;an 150 have received lucrative positions in
the large business houses of this city through
the assistance and Influence of Principal Mur
phy.
The pupils attending the commercial
department of the Lincoln Evening
School, which was recently put on an
independent baBis by the Board of Edu
cation, visited Mayor Schmltz yesterday
to thank him for his assistance in the
establishment of a business school. The
pupils had prepared an address, which
was read by Miss Lila Evans, and is as
follows: .
Klump was interviewed at the -jail to
night. He is about 35 years of age. He
declared he was entirely innocent of the
charge on which he was arrested. He said
he had no knowledge of what the alleged
sample headache powders contained, or
whence they came. He got the envelope
containing the powder addressed to hia
wife at the Lowell postoftlce with some
other mail and brought it to the house,
supposing it was an ordinary advertising
sample. He denied the truth of the re
ports that he had been attentive to an
other woman, or that there was any rea
son for his wanting hl3 wife out of the
way. â¢*%>Â¦Â¦Â»
The Sheriff and his deputies are trying
to locate Hattie Whitfleld. .She at one
time lived in this city and it is said that
Klump visited her home. Officers went
to the house of her parents. In Vergennes
to-day, but did not find her there, nor
could they learn where she had gone.
After a diligent inquiry into the circum
stances of. the case Sheriff Chapman took
William Klump into custody and lodged
him in jail here. The officers express the
belief that the deadly powders sent
through the mails were substituted for
the harmless headache powders which the
envelopes had originally contained and
that they were sent to several physicians
in the village for the purpose of throw
ing the blame upon the manufacturers of
the headache remedy and thus diverting
suspicion from the sender of the poison.
The officers who have investigated the
case state that Klump was infatuated
with another woman, a widow, whom, it
is alleged, he had agreed to marry before
he met and won the love of the pretty
16-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wat
son of Lowell. Klump had been married
twice. His first wife lives in Lowell and
it is alleged that the other woman In the
case was the cause for his separation
from her also. ....;â¢ . .
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.. March 7.âDe
velopments in the investigation into the
death of Mrs. Ada Klump, the young wife
of William Klump of Lowell, point to one
of the most cold-blooded murders Michi
gan has ever known.
Frost said to-night that notwithstand
ing that he is in jail he will prosecute the
appeal he has taken. - He said he had
nothing to say in criticism of his oppo
nents and would simply fight the verdict
against him on technical grounds.
Of Frost's colleagues in the Nome scan
dal, Noyes has been deprived of his Dis
trict Judgeship and subjected to a fine of
$1000; Knight has lost the office of United
States District Attorney for Alaska and
is now serving a term of six months in
the San Francisco County Jail; Frost, in
addition to having to serve a sentence of
one year, has lost the position of Assist
ant United States District Attorney that
he held.
Frost asked if he would be arrested in
Washington or San Francisco, and, upon
being assured that if he would agree to
go to San Francisco he need not surren
der himself until he arrived there, he
started on the journey. He notified Unit
ed States District Attorney Woodford to
day of his arrival, stating that he was
prepared to suffer his sentence. The Dis
trict Attorney then directed him to this
side of the bay.
After his conviction Frost secured a
stay of* execution of sixty days, during
which he proposed to prepare an appeal
from the decision against him. Instead
of devoting- his attention to this task,
however, he Is said to have spent his
time lobbying among hia friends in Wash
ington, hoping through- them to get an
absolute pardon. When Judge Morrow
heard of tnis imposition on the court, he
arbitrarily vacated the stay of execution
and notified Frost that he must prepare
to go to jail.
OAKLAND, March 7.â C. A. S. Frost,
who, with ex-Judge Noyes and former
United States District Attorney Knight,
was implicated in the Nome mine-jump
ing scandals and recently convicted of
contempt of court before Judge Morrow,
surrendered himself at the Alameda Coun
ty Jail to-night, where he announced his
readiness to serve his sentence of one
year."
Allen says the paper was written by
Dr. Jessup while he was on bis deathbed.
It consists of the leaves of an Insurance
memorandum book upon which are writ
ten in pencil a description of the way in
which the tragedy of which Dr. Jessup
was a victim occurred and finishing with
a wish that all his effects be given to
Allen. It was neither signed nor wit
nessed.
Judge Ellsworth said the paper was too
indefinite to be considered a will. In
answer to his questions Allen said that
Dr. Jessup left a lot of papers In the base
ment of his home, but that they had never
been examined. The court finally denied
Allen's petition for the probate of the
supposed will and ordered him to search
the papers in the basement for a will.
Dr. Jessup's estate is worth about $500,
consisting of dental tools and Jewelry.
The deceased had a divorced wife and
child, but nobody knows where they are
now.
Thomas Allen of Berkeley was in Judge
Ellsworth's court this morning to support

It is said that some of the Chinese in
the shed have sent petitions to their rela
tives in Hongkong asking that they be
allowed to return home, as they see no
chance of escaping or being landed.
Collector Spear is satisfied with the
result of the search and feels that if the
Chinese had had these weapons at the time
of the last outbreak his men would have
fared much worse than they did. In or
der that no large number of deadly
weapons may be accumulated searches
will be made from time to time.
Bunks were turned upside down, trunks
and carpet bags and other belongings
were ransacked and as thorough an in
spection as possible was made. The re
sult was the finding of a large number of
razors, nearly every Chinese .possessing
one, several heavy and very sharp cleav
ers, a long bread knife with a razor-Iika
edge and a pair of shears used for cut
ting wire.
About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon he
detailed Inspectors Sackett, Moore, Lin
quest, McDonald, Gallagher, Carlen and
Head to make a thorough search of the
quarters occupied by the Chinese. As
soon as the inspectors arrived they hud
dled the Chinese from room to room and
made a thorough pearch of all their be
longings. â¢
Word was received yesterday by Col
lector of the Port Joseph S. Spear Jr.
that the detained Chinese were again pre
paring for an outbreak and were acquir
ing all sorts of arms in order to make a
more determined resistance than before.
The reports received by the Collector were
of such a nature that he determined to
act at once.
Ever since the outbreak of the. Chinese
a few days ago in the detention shed at
the Pacific Mail dock prior to their de
portation to China a wary eye has been
kept upon those confined there. Consid
erable dissatisfaction exists among the
Chinese, ntany of whom have been cooped
up there for months. Besides there are
a number of turbulent spirits among
them, ready to incite an outbreak at any
time.
Burke was dazed when Anderson
reached him. He was taken by the lat
ter to the Harbor Hospital, where .his
condition became serious and the surgeon
feared that the man's skull was frac
tured. It was said at the hospital that
Burke may die.
When the ruffians had rendered their
victim unconscious they began rifling his
pockets. John M. Anderson, a cripple
living at 210 Steuart street, came along
and the assailants decamped, taking with
them $40 of the sailor's money.
The latest victim of the desperadoes is
Charles Burke, a sailor on the steamer
Pasadena. ' He was walking along East
street and when between Howard and
Mission was approached by two men, one
striking him first on the mouth and then
on the head, presumably with an iron
pipe or bar.
That the footpads of the city are de
termined to carry on their murderous at
tacks on citizens was again demonstrated
last night in a most brutal and daring
manner.
It was finally decided to take Miss
Schneider to the Receiving Hospital In
Oakland and have her examined as to
her sanity. This was done to-day: The
lunacy, commissioners recommended that
she be committed to an asylum. Superior
Judge Ogden deferred final action in the
case at the request of Miss Schneider's
sister^ who desires to communicate with
a brother in Chicago about caring for
their demented relative. In the mean-,
time Miss Schneider is detained at the
Receiving Hospital.
Two weeks ago Miss Schneider's^rela
tives observed that she was acting
strangely and talking incoherently. They
had her conveyed to the Alameda Sani
tarium and placed under the care of a
physician and nurses, with the hope that
her mania might be cured. Within the
past few days the condition of the un
fortunate young woman became aggra
vated and she evinced a tendency to de
stroy whatever she could lay hands on.

Hotion for New Trial for Captain
HAINS' PETITION FOE
HABEAS CORPUS DENIED
O. H. Woodworth was fined $100 yester
day by United States District Judge de
Haven, the extreme penalty provided in
the statute, for being in possession of a
counterfeit money device for advertising
purposes. Woodworth paid the fine and
was released.
Secret Service Agents Hazen, Crontn.
Moffltt and Foster expressed themselves
yesterday as being- very much dissatisfied
with the outcome of the trial. They said
that they had more than sufficient evi
dence to convict on all the counts in the
indictment, but they were unable to get
their evidence before the Jury. They had
sent to VerBennls, Vt., they said, for a
counterfeiting press which "Woodworth
had left in care of a woman there. The
press was here, but on account of the
manner in which the case was handled
they were not allowed to submit it to the
jury together with the steel blanks and
files found In Woodworth' a trunk.
With reference to the $29,000 real estate
transaction In which Woodworth figured
at Long Beach last summer, the secret
service men say that Woodworth had
$400 in one-hundred-dollar bills ancr a wad
of one-dollar notes, and that when Wood
worth paid Kempfer for the ranch ha
made four piles of the notes with a one
hundred-dollar bill on the . top of each
pile. Mrs. Wunder, the old man's daugh
ter, who had been "hypnotized" by Wood
worth, counted the money for the old
folks and announced the total as $29,000.
Before Woodworth left Los Angele*
County he sent the deeds to Kansa3,
where the ranch was situated, and they
would have been recorded had It not been
for Woodworth's carelessness in neglect
ing to affix the required war tax stamps
to the papers.
The deeds were subsequently canceled
by order of court, and honors were even,
old man Kempfer retaining the ranch
and Woodworth his bills. Woodworth
was tried for stealing the deeda, but was
acquitted, the court holding that a deed
had no money value whatever beyond the
Intrinsic value of the paper or parchment
upon which It was written.

GRAIN BROKER McDONAXD
FOUND DEAD IN HIS BOOM
Death Is Supposed to Have Been ,
Caused by Sudden Attack H
of Heart Disease.
Alexander McDonald, the well-known
jrraln broker of the firm of Schwabacher
Brothers, 112 California street, died sud
denly last Thursday night or early yester
day morning at his room in the Lick
House. IIÂ© had been complaining of patria
in the heart and stomach and attributed
them to Indigestion. Early last Thursday
evening the pains grew worse, but at 11
o'clock he said that they had disappeared
and that he was feeling well again.
At 9:30 o'clock yesterday morning Mc-
Donald having failed to appear at th*

Complains of Telephone Service
Matthew McCurrle of 715 Capp street pe
titioned the Board of Supervisors yester
day to pass an ordinance Umltlnsr tho
number of subscribers on a telephone lln*
In order to protect tho public. McCurrta
alleges that on the now twenty-party
lines now belnc installed Kirls on tho line
represent themselves as "central." ask for
the number and then the nickel which 13
glvon and no Bervice Is rendered. With
a smaller number on tho llnÂ»> It would not
be so hard to detect tho offenders. Tho.
company's* excuse for Rlvinu wh PÂ°i ir
aervlco is that they want to introduce tho
telephone In every house, and MUKSent It
better service Is desired to pay for a teic-
Dhone with less subscribers on tho line.

iv now trial in thn eniio of Chnrles Don
nelly, convicted of murder In the second
rit'pree, will bo nrgued this afternoon.
Atumn nnd Donnelly are Jointly uccu*Â«U
with Buckley.
Another affidavit was presented from
An tone Stephanl, who lives at 3392 Twen
tieth street, between Howard and Shot
well. He says that between 5;30 and 6
o'clock on the evening of October 11 he was
rating supper and heard three or four
shots In the direction of Howard street.
He ran out to his front gate and saw a
young man dressed in a laded gray suit
und light hat run past on the north side
oi Twentieth street in the direction of
Shotwell. He had since the conviction of
Buckley seen him in the County Jail and
identified him as that man. He saw an
other man dressed In dark clothes turn
round and look at Rice's prostrate form,
put something like ' a revolver In his
pocket and run down Twentieth street,
llu had not seen that man since. He
hnd not mentioned these facts before, as
ho whm not anxious to be a witness In
the case.
George Smith, a brushmaker, living at
620 Bryant street, makes affidavit that he
knew "China" Copland, who was a- ma
chinist and lived at Sixth and Shipley
streets. About 7 o'clock on the night of
October 11 he saw Copland In front .of a
s-alocn on the ground floor of the build
ing where Copland lived, inquiring for a
men named Miller, a member of the Ma
chinists' Union. Half an hour later Mil
ler made his appearance and Smith tol'l
him that Copland was looking for him.
Miller went upstairs to Copland's room
and Smith followed him. Copland was
charging his clothes when they entered
and said, "I got the ; get
me enough money to take me over the
border." Mijler and Copland whispered
together ana Smith could not hear what
they said. Miller then left and Smith
went with him. Smith has not seen. Cop
land since. He disclosed these facts for
the first time to Attorney D. J. Murphy
March 6.
In one of the affidavits Buckley alleges
that he did not murder George W. Rice,
a non-union machinist, at the crossing: of
Twentieth and Howard streets October 11.
He now claims that John Grandfleld
clubbed Rice, and another man, known as
"China" Copland, fired the shots into
Rice's prostrate form.
"When the case of "William Buckley, con
victed-of murder in the first degree, was
called in Judge Lawlor's court yesterday
for argument on the motion for a new
trial -Attorneys Ferral and D. J. Murphy,
on behalf of the prisoner, asked for a
continuance for two weeks and presented
affidavits in support of the request. Judge
Lawlor continued the matter till this att
crnoon, when he will give his decision on
the request for a coltlnuance.

The Santa Fe Company is at present
running but few boats daily between
this side and Point Richmond, and up to
the present the new restrictions have not
been enforced. With the publication of
the new charts, however, the forbidden
anchorage rules will go into effect and
the shipping community is worried.
While there is no expressed objection
to the Commissioners establishing a fair
way to the Santa Fe boats there is a de
cided objection to the fairway as grant
ed. The Oakland ferry and freight boats
have a right of way which covers quite
a space of harbor surface, and the cau
salito and Tiburon ferries monopolfze a
g-oodly stretch . at right angles. Within
the angle made by these two fairways
lies the safest and most convenient an
chorage the bay affords. Now comes
the Santa Fe fairway, which cuts the
angle about evenly and completely wipes
out this anchorage ground. Ships are
not only forbidden to anchor within the
lines indicated on the chart reproduced
herewith, but must not anchor near these
lines, lest the changing tide should swing
the vessel within the forbidden limits.
Shipping folk say the Santa Fe boats
could with safety use the Sausalito and
Tiburon fairway as far as Angel Island
or else adopt a course far enough to the
eastward to avoid the anchorage grounds.
The new fairway has been established,
however, and anchorage spacious enough
to accommodate a whole fleet of ships has
been taken awi\y from the commercial
community. Whnt action tho shipping
people will take remains to bo seen, but
it is more than likely that the Harbor
Commissioners will be asked to modify
their Uheral grant to the Santa Fe Com
pany and to rearrange the fairway bo ntÂ»
not to Interffro with Ions established an
chorage privileges.
Tho Bhlpplnu community will 1>Â« rcpre*
Kiitfd: the n^xt tlrno the Harbor Commlfi*
planer* voto on tho question of cstubllMh
ing new fnlrwnyH.
The Commissioners have virtually made
to the Santa Fe Company a present of
tho safest and most convenient anchor
age space that the harbor affords. The
shipping community complains with al
most one voice that It was never con
sulted In the matter, and that, although
the fairway was established December 11,
the knowledge of the existence of this
new restriction comes as news.
The railroad company applied for a
fairway to Point Richmond in the latter
part o-f last year. The Harbor Commis
sioners referred the matter to Chief
Wharfinger Henderson, who on Decem
ber 11 recommended that the privilege be
granted and that a fairway be estab
lished in accordance with the chart sub
mitted by the railroad company with its
application. Acting upon this recommen
dation the board adopted a resolution fa
vorable to the railroad company's request
and the Santa Fe fairway was estab
lished. The board then notified the
Coast and Geodetic survey officials of
their action and asked that cognizance
be taken of the newly established fair
way in the next edition of the Govern
ment charts of the harbor.
WHEN tho State Board of
Harbor Commissioners in
December last granted to the
Santa Fe Railroad Company
a ferry fairway from Mis
sion-street wharf to Point Richmond few
interested In the shipping of the port re
alized that this action virtually wiped
out what remains of anchorage space
within convenient distance of tho city's
wharves. ThÂ© Issuance yesterday of an
amended chart showing the forbidden an
chorages of the harbor came as a big and
not altogether pleasant surprise.

.. Dr. E. H. Shelmardlne of Philadelphia,
who. with his wife, was a passenger on
board the Waesland, attributes the acÂ«

breaking his own neck and causing tho
death of Klslo Emmett. Dr. Sholmardlne
lost his valuable instruments and Jewelry.

had on board his thirty-flvo years' savings
in specie, but. he did not attempt to leave
tho bridge to fetch the money away. All

Mrs. -Hanson of Chicago, a widow, was a
considerable loser by tho sinking of the
Waesland. Tho two sons of Dangerflelrt

and was a prominent business man and

P. R. Ferguson, a saloon passenger,
who, curiously enough, was on board the
Wuesland when she collided with a
schooner, not far from Philadelphia, says
tho principal excitement took tho form of
rushing for lifeboats. He saw a man who
hnd seven life belts attached to various
parts of his body.
As the last boat, in -which Ferguson
was seated, was leaving the ship's side,
cries for help wero heard on board of
her and the boat returned and found that
two of the Wacsland'B crew had been left
behind. One of these men . had slept
throughout from the first Impact to the
last, boat leaving the sinking steamer and
only discovered hlB pcriloua position when
tho sea water Hooded his bunk through

Bush for the Lifeboats.
Tho collision was terrific: alike in the sud
denness of the shock and In the completeness
of the steamer's destruction, and we think
wo were most fortunate in escaping as we did.
A rush of excited people from all parts of
the ship Immediately ensued. The passengers
tumbled uo Just as they h/id retired for the
night. The men, women and children were in
their nlshtdregies. In a few momenta the pas
sengers had thrown u shawl or a blanket over
their shoulder*. Terror and bewilderment
reigned for a fow moment", but the panaengera

or three hours, finally getting; In touch with

bottom with the Wncsland.
I saw the whole affair. I was late in turn
ing in as the night was foggy and we naturally
were apprehensive. Practically all the pas
sengers toad retired. I was taking a last look
at the weather, and in so doing peered over
the ship's side, when, without the slightest
warning, there came a fearful crash, which
made the Waesland stagger from stem to
stern. "My God, we are struck," I shouted.
Then there loomed right over our ship's bow
the steamer which had run into us. It was
terrifying, of course. We instantly recognized
the peril. The darkness at that time was im
penetrable, but there was no mistaking tho
terrible consequences of such an Impact. The
nose of the Harmonldea appeared to have eaten
right into our side. We were going very slowly
with no more speed than was necessary to
keep headway. We were struck at right angles,
a tremendous hole was made, and for a mo
ment the stem of the Harmonides was literally
Inside our ship. -
An officer of the Waesland, In an Inter-
View, gave a graphic description of the
loss of the steamer. He said:
As Told by an Officer.
As the last boats were leaving the fast
sinking' ship, whose decks were already
awash, an explosion announced that her
boilers had burst and forty mlnutea after
the iirst impact the Waesland gave a
mighty lurch and disappeared beneath the
waves, sinking about midway between
Holyhead ana Tuskar light. Nothing
was saved except what the passengers
and crew wore. The boats containing the
passengers were for a time separated, ow
ing to the fog, but eventually they all
reached the sides of the Harmonides, and
the survivors were taken on board that
vessel, where they received every atten
tion. A. pilot boat met the Harmonides
off the Isle of Anglesey and communi
cated the news of the disaster to persons
ashore, with the result that tugs were
dispatched to search for the Harmonides
anu accompanied the steamer to this port.
Here the passengers were landed and
comfortably housed. They will proceed
to Philadelphia Wednesday on board the
Red Star line steamer rsordland.
The surviving passengers, as /a rule,
escaped with only a few slight bruises.
The Harmonides' stem and bow plates
were so torn and twisted that it appeared
marvelous that she escaped sinking. She
also has a deep dent in her port side.
Bursting of the Boilers.
I When tho disaster occurred Wednesday
night tho two vessels were steaming slow
ly off tho coast of tho Isle of Anglesey.
Tho Harmonides crashed head on into
the Waesland and backed away, but once
again struck tho then sinking ship, mak
ing a great gap in her side. Though the
seu was pcriectly smooth, the densenesa
of the fog added to the terrors of the pas
sengers of the Waesland. The women
rushed on deck screaming, but were soon
teassured by tho ofllcers. The boats were
quickly lowered, but the operation re
sulted in two fatalities. Tho end of one
of the lifeboats slipped from its davit
and precipitated the occupants of the boat
into tho sea. A passenger, Edward Dan
gerfleld of Kansas, struck his head
against the boat's ilttings and was in
stuntly killed, and Elsie femmett, 12 years
old, the daughter of the Kev. A. M., Em
mett, was drowned. The other persons
who were in the boat were picked up.
The bravery of the passengers; many of
â¢vvlicm 'were Scandinavian emigrants, was
exemplary. Precedence was given to the
women and children. '. ? - ; ,-. Â¦Â¦;-'Â¦-
Crashes Into the Waeslnnd.
. LIVERPOOL, March . 7.â The British
steamer Harmonides, from Brazilian
ports,^ which was in collision with and
sank J the Red Line, steamer Waesland
Wednesday night about forty miles south
west of Holyhead,- and which was towed
to this port early this morning by the
tugs that went in search of her, has a
great hole in her bows. A rescued pas
senger of the Waesland, who was on
board the Harmonides, said the Waesland
was . run into amldship in a fog at mid
night and sank half an hour afterward,
her boilers bursting as she went down.
The report that only two of the passen-
Eers of the Waesland,. a man and a child,
lost their lives is confirmed. In addition
one woman was injured. Some of the
Wnesland's boats were in the water a
couple of hours, owing to the fog, before
they could get alongside the Harmonides.
When the Harmonides arrived here her
â¢decks were crowded with half-clad'pas
sengers of the Waesland, whose pale and
haggard faces told the story of their try
ing experiences. 8o hurried was the de
purture of the passengers from the sink
ing ship that In some cases they were
only covered with blunkots and hundker
chiefs were their only headgear.
Connor said he was anxious to find out
why the water company on the last day
Irut one of the investigation should bring
in a list of property worth $3,000,000, of
which no one had any previous knowl
edge. He insisted that it was his desire
to treat the company fairly, but he
wanted to be thoroughly informed on all
points before finally casting his vote.
Braunhart moved that the company be
requested to renew its offer to expend
$450,000 next year for the enlarging and
laying of new water mains in districts to
be designated by the Chief Engineer of
the Fire Department. The board then
adjourned to meet on Monday, when the
takinp of ncr testimony will begin.
Brandestein protested against the pub
lished intimation that "he was a crea
ture of Spring Valley." He Bald he tried
to do his duty honestly during* the long
Inquiry and he favored the proposed
water ordinance because he believed it to
be a fair and just one.
Braunhart insisted upon a vote upon
his resolution, but Brandensteln urged
that it would be unnecessary if the con
tent of the company to the reopening of
the inquiry could be obtained. Schussler
telephoned to the company's attorney and
reported later that the company would
*groe to the proposition on condition It
Â¦was allowed to put In testimony in re
buttal of any offered before the board.
This was agreed to and Braunhart with
drew his resolution.
A communication from the water com
pany was read protesting ugainst the re
uuction in the amount proposed to be al
lowed for hydrants and giving statistics
In (support of the company's claim that
the rates ought to be Increased.
This provoked a long diecussion, which
was opened by Comte, who 6ald that
there was a legal phase of the matter
which the board could not afford to ig
nore. That was that the action suggest
ed might invalidate the water ordinance
if fixed by the board without giving the
water company due notice of the reopen
ing of the matter. :..y ;
Jitaunhurt was willing to give the com
pany notice. He at once prepared a reso
lution declaring It the sense of the board
to reopen the water rale inquiry in order
to hear further testimony as to the value
of the Suburban Company'* property. The
suggestion of Comic that the water com
pany be directed to Know cause why the
inquiry should not bo reopened was fav
orably considered.
liraunhart remarked that it was his
desire to ascertain the value of such
iiropcrty of the Suburban Company Â«ia is
being used for supplying Bun Francisco
with water, Ho was ulxo anxious to
know how much of the property was es
sential to the supplying of water fur this
city.
i-nslncer Kchui-slcr of the water com
pany said that the value greatly exceeded
the cost and that testimony had already
been advanced by the company in proof ,
cf tho contention that it was all in use
.for water purposes only.
After the call to order by Mayor
Schmitz, Supervisor Brauhhart made a
statement in which he asked that the in
quiry be reopened in order that the valu
ation of the property of the Suburban
Water Company, which was bought out
liy Spring Valley, might be ascertained.
The Board of Supervisors at a special
meeting held yesterday for the purpose
of fixing v.-ater rates for the coming fis
cal year decided to reopen the Inquiry
Into the valuation of the property of the
Spring Valley Water Company.

Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Unsettled weather was the most unsatisfac
tory feature of the week. A sudden thaw fol
lowing an exceptionally- heavy snowfall pro
duced freshets nnd floods." Manufacturing inter
ests suffered and consumers were urgent for
shipment of delnyed goods, while great quanti
ties'of merchandise became stalled In transit.
Preparations for an enormous spring trade con
tinue undimlnlshed. There Is still some tui
?iisinp?s regarding the labor situation at the
coal mines and at Fall River there is disagree
ment as to the length of a cut of cloth, al
though Increased wages were assured. Â«
Not enly Is there no Improvement to bo
recorded in the Iron and steel outlook, .but
floods in the Pittsburg region . added to the
pressure by completely closing many plants
and damaging much costly machinery.
AU staples steadied and some roue sharply,
the net changes for the week amounting to a
considerable advance. It was natural for grain
to hold firm when wheat receipts at the West
werÂ« 2.0Si),:U4 bushels, compared with .'1,747,057
bushels last year. Exports of wheat, flour
Included, were 4,l74,S0t bushels, against 3.S15,
032 bushels In the, previous week and a.715,930
bushels a year ago. \ .
. Speculation wan aulet, with many guesses
as to the coming report of farm reserves.
Failures Tor the week numbered 170 In the
United States. Hgalnst 208 last year and 17
In , Canada, against 20 last year.

The first of a series of lectures aimed
at the conversion of Jews* to Christianity
given under the auspices of the Presby
terian Mission, at 1127 Mission street, was
delivered last night by Rev. M. Berco
vitz. The small hall was filled, and
among the audience were many Jews who
had adopted Christianity. The title of the
lecture was "Jesus, Greatest Friend of
the Jews and Promoter of Judaism," and
It was a scholarly effort to demonstrate
that Christianity was only an amplifica
tion of Judaism and that by embracing it
the Jews lost none of the essential fea
tures of their old religion and gained
many new and desirable additions.

Slauson agreed to allow the company
build its tracks across his land and prom
ised to relinquish his title on the condi
tion that a depot should be placed on the
property and that all passenger trains
should stop at it. The company built the
track, but failed to construct the depot
or stop Its trains at the point agreed
upon.
After the lapse of several years Slauson
decided that he wanted his land back.
The railroad company claimed that It
owned the property because its rights in
the matter had not been questioned for
r.-ore than five years after the track had
been built. The court holds that the cona
rany did not live up to Us agreement and
consequently never came into - possession
of tht land.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that J. S. Slauson of Los Angeles owns
a trifle more than a quarter of a mile of
land on which the Southern California
Railway Company runs its trains. The
case has been in the courts for years, and
en Its settlement depends a number of

He has stayed to face -the music, but has
not yet deemed it necessary to report to

the case is still looking-for him.
Young Crowther told his troubles* to
everybody but the policeman yesterday.
He claims that all the trouble | was due
to a false friend, a bunko man, who
worked on him an old, old game. This
young social lion, this bank' clerk of
Kobe, who was so wise that he, came to
San Francisco without references and
carried the citadels of the exclusive set
by storm, admits that he fell a victim to
a game that ought not to have caught
a clerk of the most bucolic bank fin the
world.
Crowther says he has been grossly
wronged by Landlord Robinson of the
Knickerbocker, and others, and that he
has done no intentional wrong. He says

Oscar G. Murray, Percy C. Kernan and
Robert J. Vance, the bell boys'who were
arrested last Monday night by -Detectives
Ryan and O'Dea for stealing jewelry and
other articles from rooms in private
hotels where they were employed, were
booked at the City Prison yesterday on
two charges of burglary each. They did
the same sort of work in Los Angeles be
fore coming here.
August Blanqui and Henry Dumas were
booked at the City Prison yesterday by
Detective O'Dea and Policemen Ennis
and O'Connell on a charge of burglary
and another of petty larceny. They are
accused cf robbing lodging-houses where
they loomed.
The particular places they are charged
with robbing are the lodging-houses kept
by Frederick Barbera at 327 Montgomery
avenue, and Eugene Baldit â¢ at 815 Jack
son street, the first on February 28 and
the other on March 1. From both houses
were stolen wearing apparel, bed clothes
and jewelry.
The cflicers learned that the defendants
were living at 16-12 Eleventh avenue. South
San Francisco, with two women, and
when they reached there Thursday night
Blanqui and Dumas showed fight. Dumas
attacked O'Dea and Ennis with a razor
and had to be clubbed Into submission,
while O'Connell had a hard struggle with
Blanqui before overpowering him. When
searched at the City Prison each had a
revolver in his pocket and a bunch of
skeleton keys. They came here from the
East during the strike.
George A. Newhall denies that he was
either social or financial sponsor ior
young Crowther. He says he did give
him a ticket to the charity ball, the re
sult of a "touch." Crowther rushed into
Newhall's office and asKed where he
could buy a ticket. Newhall had a bunch
lying on his desk which â¢ he had j pur
chased and he gave the bank dent one.
Crowther did the rest.
Crowther claims that he has ; an uncle
In Glasgpw who sends him Â¦Â¦ remittances,
but says' he. has not money enough- to
cable him. He says his father. Is. not yet
In New York, and he uoes not know
where to reach him by wire en route.
This is: the story t Crowther told:-yester

had not trusted him; and to asvmany re
cently found friends- as would listen:. tÂ»Â»
him. He had spent : Thursday, night' in
OaÂ«v.and, and: by the advice -of friends
there- he had. come over in â¢â¢ the morning
to square things. But he didn't go near
police headquarters nor the Knicker
bocker. He called at Hammersmith &
Field's and at 'Shreve's, at both of which
places he had left stones to be set. He
had a short but unsatisfactory interview
with George A. Newhall', who does not
relish being given as a reference without
his permission being 1 asked.' The Police
Commissioner told him- flatly that he had
either been a knave or a fool; Crowther
also telephoned to numerous friends, and
said he would straighten everything out.

- At a Powell-street bar, near the Co
lumbia Theater, the solicitor waited for
"Jimmy," but when the latter showed
him the check - his philanthropy was
changed to deep disgust. He wanted the
check cashed at the bar, but Crowther
refused to . permit - any such irregular
linancial transaction. â¢'Â»â¢ â¢ v >Â¦Â¦ . .
"Why, certainly," Crowther replied,
and hurried away- to the Van Ness ave
nue hostelry for his stormy interview
with Landlord Robinson, in which he
proudly flashed the check, and got In ex
change a receipted bill, $3 in cash and a
check- for $17 50. Crowther wanted more
cash, but didn't get It. Â¦â¢. .,
"By the way," said the Good'Samari
tan, "I'm a little short myself to-day. Let
me have $10 out of what is left, over."
A life insurance solicitor with reddish
hair, whose name Is in the hands of an
attorney whom Crowther consulted yes
terday, but not in the hands of the po
lice, is the wicked man whose' little
game punctured the bank clerk's : social
balloon. According to Crowther's story
this solicitor came to his rescue with, ef
fusive expressions of sympathy, and said
he would have the money for him in a
jiffy. That was when an unfeeling land
lord was wanting money for room rent
and board and extras, including the love-'
ly dinner at which the Kobe' bank clerk
had entertained a bevy of Â¦- San-Fran
cisco's fairest. And sure enough in not
more than two Jlfffes the red-headeu, vil

Several incidents leading up to the i

of a clash between Barns and Herrin. j
On Thursday last Burns hniied a well-!

because he lies and if thoroughly unre- 1

that has anything to do with him. I want

The committeeman inquired: "Do you
want me to say this to John Lyncn and
Jere Burke?"
"You need not speak to Burke on this
topic, because he is a Democrat." replied
the colonel, "but you can repeat to
Lynch what 1 have said."'

business in order was the selection of a
temporary chairman. Charles Sonntag,
committeeman at large, nominated Rior
dan. Nominations were then closed and
Martin Keliy moved that Riordan be de- j
flared temporary chairman by acclama
tion. The motion, put by Sonntag, pre
vailed.
A. B. Truman did not wait for a decla
ration from the chair that the next order
of business would be the election of a
temporary secretary, but saved time by
putting 1 in nomination for that position
Clifford McClelian. Maurice L. Asher
nominated Pat Prendergast. After brief
and pointed discussion the committee de
cided that the roll should be called.
Asher and Truman were appointed tel
lers. The roll was called. McClelian re
ceived 40 votes and Prendergast 31. Both
candidates and the chairman declined to
vote. Sixteen committeemen of the
ninety were absent.
Sub-Committees to Be Appointed.
A. B. Truman moved that the chair
appoint a committee of five on permanent
organization and order or business.
Jesse Marks moved that the chair ap
point a committee of five on constitution,
by laws and rules of order.
Eoth motions prevailed. The chairman
was given time to make the appoint
ments.
Norman W. Hall attempted to introduce
the following resolution, but it was ruled
out of order on the ground that perma
nent organization had not been effected:
Resolved. That we recommend the parsagc
of a resolution by Congress calling for the
reports of the inspectors of the War Depart
ment and a full investigation of the transport
service between San Francisco and the Philip
pine i.
Hall sought to explain that the resolu
tion was introduced in justice to certain
members ol the California Congressional
delegation. His remarks were interrupt
ed by demands for adjournment. The
committee adjourned to meet at the call
of the chairman.
After adjournment the Burns and Kelly
men celebrated their victory. They as
serted that the fight against Crimmins
was on and that Colonel Burns would
oppose any man in the Republican party
who was found, to be doing politics with
Crimmins.
From all accounts it Is made clear that
Kerrin and Crimmins In distributing the
spoils of local conquest hogged everything
for themselves and gave the Burns "crowd
only gilded bricks. The bricks, however,
were handsomely gilded. In fact they
were as beautiful as those that Gage and
the "Colonel" passed out in the Sena
torial contest.

On Thursday the soldiers on the Meade
were landed and thoroughly fumigated.
They were then placed in barracks, but
the three deserters managed to slip out
ar }d escape from the island. The Meade
will be moved alongside the hulk Omaha
to-day and will be thoroughly fumigated,
it will, take two or three days to fumi
gate the vessel. The delay to"Hhe Meade
has cost the Federal Government more
than $40,000.
The men who escaped were casuals on
their way to Manila. They left on tho
transport Meade last Saturday for the
Philippines, and when the vessel was &K)
miles out a case of smallpox was discov
ered. The physician .in charge ordered
the captain to turn back, and the trans
port reached here Monday flying the yel
low flag. The quarantine officers went on
board and -after ascertaining the gravity
of the case ordered the vessel into quar
antine. She is now lying at Angel Island.
Dr. Cummings, head quarantine officer,
had the smallpox patient taken off the
Meade yesterday. The victim was low
ered into a lifeboat, which was towed to
the_ landing by the launch Bacillus. The
patient is now among the other, unfortu
nates suffering from contagious dis
eases.
Three soldiers escaped from: the quar
antine station at Angel Island Thursday
night in a rather sensational" manner.
They secured an' "old scow that was
moored 100 . feet from the landing at
Angel Island, cut the rope that held a
30-pound anchor and allowed the unwieldy
craft to drift with the tide. The captain
of the steam launch Bacillus went in
search of the scow yesterday and found
it near Strawberry Point, Sausalito. The
'tide was running too swiftly to tow the
boat back to the island, so it was an
chored in the stream. '.
