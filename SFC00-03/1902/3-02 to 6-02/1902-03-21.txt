As already stated, Mr. Leiahm ann soma

and Bulgarian Governments saving tha
right of the United States Government to
prefer a demand for reparation and re
imbursement In the Stone case when It is
able to fix the responsibility for the ab
duction. .TJp to this time the official re
ports from Minister Leishmann, supple
mented by verbal reports from "Spencer
Eddy, have not put the State Department
in possession of sufficient facts to deter
mine this question of responsibility.
WASHINGTON. March 20.â The persist;
ent circulation of reports that the Stato
Department . had . made a demand upon
Turkey for reimbursement of the money
expended in the ransom of Miss ' Stone Is
causing a good deal of annoyance to tha
officials of that : department. It. can be
stated as a fact that. the State Depart
ment has made no such demand on Tur
key, and consequently the Turkish Gov
ernment has not flatly refused to pay.

General Miles was questioned as to the
reasons of locating - the American -. army
of occupation at Tampa â¢ and holding' it
so long. with the resulting congestion. /Re-
Plying to the. first question, : he: said, it
was because of the order to occupy Ha
vana. The', delay was due to the fact
that .the American' army Â¦ was supplied
with only sixty-four rounds of . ammuni
tion, which would' nof have' been;*suffi
clent for .more than half an hour; of
fighting. Considering : that Â¦ Havana 1 was
one of the best fortified cities': In * the
world he said that to"; have attacked " It
would, have been ' foolhardy In -the "ex
treme. He declined,' however, to" criticize
the then Secretary of .War/ General Al
ger, for the condition of affairs, .-saying
that probably, any one else in the position
would have. done about what 'he did. '^ He
laid the blame for .this condition of un
preparedness at the door ' of Â¦ Congress.*- -â¢â¢
. In the course of his remarks General
.Uiles told the committee -that wjthithe
\\Hl a law he could' now name'' the t J meb'..
Then he added. that In all*- probability,
the senior general of the army would not
under the provision he had quoted. have
been in position to do anything, and he
called attention to the clause relieving,
him (the senior general) of command and
making It possible for any other officer
to "be appointed. He declared that, under
section 7 it would be 'competent to -. -one
day to promote a captain to the position
of a brigadier and the next day make
him- chief of staff,' thus practically-plac
ing a captain at the head of the* army.'
Warming up somewhat he asserted that
the bill was calculated to ' accomplish no
purpose except to allow the. Secretary -of.
War and the Adjutant General to Â¦- pro
mote the Interests of their personal'favor
ites. Â£gH .-Â¦'.. - v Â¦

the- result that the army was soon on its

message which he had sent to General
Shafter, "I had been ' compelled : to . get
around to a dozen or ' more ma jors, ; as
many colonels and any number. of' gener
als constituting a general staff?" â¢"
at Santiago/ and I hastened to .the home
of Secretary Long, where the news '. was
confirmed. Shafter was then at\:Tampa
and I sat down there, in the Secretary's
house/ and wrote a' dispatch directing him
w -m* y ASHIXGTON. March 20.
jg Jm / âGeneral -Miles -to-day
OT /S / told the Senat** Commit
nf 1^ lev on Military Affairs
y V that If the bill introduced
by " Senator HawlÂ«Â»y at
the ir.pt.irrf r>f the War Department for
the organization of a general staff of 'the
rrrny ehould bpcome a law he would de
cline to longer hold his commission. The
reason he gave for the statement isthat
the bill Is uttor]:- subversive of the inter
ests of the military establishmentrand he
said he would not he a party, to such a
proceeding to the extent of even', .contin
uing to hold his place.
Tlic statement was made in the course
of a prolonged hearing: by the 'committee,
Â¦which was conducted behind closed doors
and In which General Miles touched upon
a variety of subjects connected with the
â¢xmy. .
OBJECTS TO THIS SECTION.
The portion of the bill to which he di
rected his especial criticism Is that con
tained in' Section 7, reading as follows: .
"That from and after the passage of
this act the senior general officer of the
army shall be. assigned to command such
portion of the army as the President. may
direct, or b* detailed to. duty , In '.the .'gen
eral staff corps. All duties prescribed by
' law for the commanding general of the
ermy shall be performed by, the chief of
the general staff Â©r other general officer
designated by the Secretary of War, pro
vided, that so . long as the ' present lleu-
tenant-grneral of, the antoy continues on
thÂ« active list he shall be thÂ© chief of the
peneral staff and upon the Eeparation
from active service of the said^leutenant
prneraJ of the army 'said offlce, except as
herein provided, shall cease."
Â¦WOULD DESTROY TJNTTY.
General Miles said that if this provision
should become a law It would* have the
Â«Â£Tect of destroying the unity of the army
and he read numerous authorities, includ
â¢ lnÂ« Napoleon. Wellington, Washington,
Cue and Grant, to show the necessity of
having onÂ© head to the army and of .'con
trolling authority. His .own. experience
and observation had, he said,. had the ef-'
i Â»ct of confirming - these views, Â¦ and . he

had been going. from blunder to. blunder,
claimed^ Immunity from criticism, and If
this continued It would follow "the pre

war." The. speaker proceeded to glve-a

ment's. treatment of the Boers and Its mis
calculations, declaring thatfthe honor and
Interests of the country were just as dear

Mr. .Lowther has', been identified for
years with the Kansas State Holiness As
sociation as. its president.. He 'believes
that In religion as well as in world-build
ing God Is proceeding from lower to high
er forms, and that this process must con
tinue in the future as it has in the past.
He contends that creeds are valuable only
as landmarks, says that lack of freedom
for the soul is like 'compressing: a lady's
waiBt in corsets to compel It to grow ac
cording to a certain fashionable Ideal, and
declares that religion can never reach the
fullness of naturalness until .It is free'
from . fear of : persecution . for* Its highest
and holiest concepts.
That Adam and Eve as first created had no
moral perception of their obligations of obedi
ence; that In eating of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge 'of good and evil they had done
nothing except what the others about them
were doing, and that they themselves had
done, that is, like beasts. - but - they - had ' a.
hlpher vision of spiritual things than formerly
and consequently they felt guilty.
That Christ died for man to show man how
to die for man; that this- willingness to die
for. man should be multiplied by exactly the
number of disciples of Christ, and that the
atonement can never be- completed- until this
Idea prevails. â¢ Â¦ .
That the serpent who talked Â¦ to Eve wua
a man, one ot the race to which she and
Adam belonged, that he had not come into
a consciousness of God, therefore was classed
-with the beasts, . and that there were other
inhabitants or. members of the race... If not;
how did Cain find his wife in the land of
Nod, where none of Adam's children except
Cain had sane?' If not, whence came the
daughters of men -whom the sons of God took
for their wives? The reasonable interpreta
tion Is that descendants of Adam were called
sens of God because having entered into a
conscious knowledge of God. they would claim
him as their creator and worship him. .' The
others, not knowing God, were called eons and
daughters of men. . â¢

bill, and Rawlins of Utah, McCumber of

mack of Tennessee and- Money and llc-
Laurin of Mississippi In opposition to it.
The speeches In the main, were a rein
forcement cf arguments that have been
advanced heretofore, no new points being
raised.
The principal point made by the oppo
nents of the measure was- that Federal
officials ought to be treated. In the courts
precisely as are other citizens. Three sub
stitutes for the bill are pending and will
be presented when the voting begins to
morrow.

there late in the day. There was a very
general inquiry as to whether, by passiny
the criticisms- upon various officials as
reported in the press, General Miles* had
not exposed himself to disciplinary treat
ment/ The answer to this must be based
on the exact amount of privilege which
attaches â to testimony given ' before a
committee" of Congress. This
arose last week in the course of General'
Hughe's' testimony before the -Senate'
Philippine â¢ Committee, when the Â¦ general '
sought to escape answering questions
,which/would involve criticism -by him; of
his superior officer, 'General Otis.' 'It-'ap
peared that there was a variance of opin
ion in the committee Itself as,t(>.how. far
General Hughes was at liberty to" violate
nnny rules and proprieties even-- in '.'an-j
swering, to committee questions, and the
question itself was left unsettled. ':.
While " General Miles did -i not- expect ,
when: he gave his testimony'that it would
be made ''public in any' form; J he. Is now
willing that it shall be published. by -the
committee, making himself Â« the Â¦ broad
statement that the statements which were
given to the i press as those made | by: him- 4
self before the committee, were misrepre-'
sentatlons, totally, unwarranted. â¢ "Â«,'
Secretary , Root exhlblted : little feeling
when his attention .was called .to. the pro^
cecdlngs- before the committee. ' He- re
marked that he was very soi"ry that 'Lieu
tenant General Miles opposed - this h bill.
He pointed out that ;under Section .7, of
which General MJles complained, the lieu- 1
tenant ; general would have : greatly - en
larged powers In army management' in
stead of being restricted in his functions,'
as â¢! he supposed. As ~ to the -question
whether General Miles had said anything
which: would require action at the ; hands
of the department or the President;, the

ing to await an official copy of the com
mittee hearing , before reaching' any ide

Would It be to her interest to put ! forward

The Attitude of Russia. *
the imperial Government received withahe
most perfect calm the announcement of the
Anglo-Japanese agreement. | The principles
which have guided Russian policy since the
beginning of the disturbances in China remain
and will remain invariable. Russia insists on
the maintenance of the independence - and hv

Only ten days ago Count Cassini called
at the State Department and assured Sec
retary Hay that Russia would respect the
principles of freedom of commerce and
integrity of China. While gratified s with
the Embassador's verbal assurances, nhls.
gratification was intensified when the
Secretary received them In form of ?mem
! orandum. In their treaty of alliance
Great Britain and Japan declared their
purpose to be the preservation of the open
door, in China and Korea .and the main
tenance of the Independence and territo
rial integrity of those, countries. The
declarations. of Russia and France state
emphatically these are . principles upon
which their policies are based ana
.which they propose to continue to respect.
. Diplomats and officials concur in . the
statement that to Secretary Hay should
be given credit for the satisfactory char
acter of the International condition of the
Chinese question. When he began his
work, in 1&S9, the open door was an elusive
dream. He crystallized it into form and
added to it the integrity of China, the
preservation of which is now solemnly
guaranteed by the- five great powers..
Takahirl, Japanese Minister, .was indis-.;
posed to-day; and could, not be seen re
garding the effect of the. treaty on Japan:
' Word Due From Japan.'
It is expected that the : Japanese : Gov-"
ernment will make a statement regarding
the Russo-Franco declaration, but it -will
undoubtedly be an expression of'justifica
tion that these countries should havejin
nounced adherence to principles 'which
Japan earnestly^ supports. ,; One diplomat

powers assures the peace of the world in

Russia this is the flrst time since the

j These declarations are significant for an

PARIS, March 20.â On application of the
Panama Canal Company the Civil Tribu
nal to-day approved the eventual cession
of the canal property to the United States,
subject to a reserve regarding modifica
tions to be obtained from the Colombian
Government concerning articles 20 and 21
of the agreement.
The Conservatives In our. country are badly,
in need of money. They realize that the Lib
erals are becoming a greater - menace every
day. With the exception Â¦ of Panama and
Colon we are already In possession of the whole
isthmus. The Government troops want silver
for pay Instead of worthless paper money,
with which they are being paid. Gold is needed
for the purchase of aims and ammunition and
ships oflwar. In order to get this gold the
Government has hit upon the plan of giving
away something worth $40.000, 000. for $l,CO0.
000. That Is what President . Sanclemente got
for -signing the extension ef- franchise which
Congress has refused to ratify.
The Liberals of Colombia notified the French
Canal Company that this extension, granted
upon the sole authority, of one man, was not
valid and the State Department at Washing
ton received a note of similar import. In spito
of this fact the French company gave $1,000;
000 for the signature of Sanclemente.
Senor Silva was replaced probably because
he would not ~ give assurances at Washington
that this 1910 extension would be legal. .. The
preseiff Colombian Government la friendly to
i-'rance and la now negotiating for & loan in
Paris, eo it sent Senor Concha to .Washington
to smooth over- obstacles in the way of a
sale to the United States of French conces
sions. â¢ . â¢ . -'Â¦Â¦ â¢- .
Senor Silva was rather suddenly suc
ceeded' by Minister Concha, who favors
a consummation of the sale. The friends
of the deposed diplomat state that his
successor was sent here because Senor
Silva would not- give assurances at Wash
ington that the title was clear. Dr. Res
trepo,. one. of the leading Liberals of Co
lombia, said: : '":â¢,Â¦â¢:.â¢"-
Members of the Liberal party intimate
that the French promoters/believing the
revolution will triumph and realizing that
tho necessary extension of ten years' time
granted by President Manuel A. Sancle
mente of Colombia is, illegal, are trying
to sell its concessions before 1904, when
its certain rights expire. . At least this Is
the view, of the Liberal party of Colom
bia upon the proposed sale of rights
to the United States for f40.000.000.
NEW YORK, March 20.â That the Pan
ama ,Canal Company has no clear title to
sell to the United States is. the conten
tion of Martinez Silva, until a few weeks
ago Colombian Minister to this country.
"There is no I clear title i which the
French company has to sell," he said.
"Their title is far from available. I have
urged the formation of a treaty between
the United States and Colombia which 1
believe would solve the question." .

Bad to Pass Water Very Often Day and Night.
Cured by the Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp-Root.
DR. KILMER &.CO.. Bingharnton, N. ?. ' '
About two year^ ago I had a very severe case^of kidney and bladder, trouble. '
The pain in the small of my back was Â§."> severe that I could not stand it to" stay"-
in one position more than a moment or two. and was obliged to pass water- very
often day and night. I tried medicines and doctors without getting relief. Noticing f
an advertisement in the Topeka State Journal of Swamp-Root, I determined to.
give it a trial, and bought a bottle. By the time I had finished the first bottle the
pain had entirely disappeared from my biick. The pain and ; frequent desire to
pass water ceased. However, I continue! to take the medicine, using about six '.
bottles in all. That was over a year ago. and I have had no return of the trouble â¢ \

LONDON, March 20/â A dispatch to the Times from Klerksdorp,' Transvaal Colony,
says that the Boers in the Westerly Transvaal \are v.'cll supplied with guns and ammunition
and have unlimited; support and a large b mount of stock; that their numbers give tliem confi
dence, while the blockhouse system has not yet been extended enough to alarm them. -What
is possible has been done, continues the correspondent, but owing to the insufficiency of
troops the British columns have been too small to cope with the Boer forces,"
which are all composed of fighting men \yithout any intention of surrendering.
WASHINGTON,' Marclr2O^RepresentativeVRyan of New York to-day handed to
President Roosevelt a. copy of "the resolutions adopted at. a -meeting held in Buffalo, March.
3, expressing sympathy with the Boers, and- calling on the Government of the United States
to put an end to the shipment of mules from New -Orleans, to South Africa. The President,
said he would give. them consideration.
"We desire to record our admiration of the magnificent stand the brave South Afri
can republics have made against- the colossal might of the British empire,- and to congratu
late the humane Boer leader Delarey on his recent; great victory;,, which not only covers
England '.with disgrace and ridicule, a result eminently gratifying to the rest of the civilized
world, but which must have a chastening effect on the jingoes of the greatest helot empire
the world has ever seen." * ..."..

LONDON. March 20.â Ogden- S (Limited)
as the local representative of the Ameri
can Tobacco Company to-day gave notice
of their Intention to give their entire net
prcfit ar.d Â£::0.\CO0 jeaily for the next fcur
ytuns as a bonus to their customers.
The American Tobacco Company'3 bo
nus scheme is the sensation of the day In
the tobacco world of Great Britain. "Un
paralleled"," "stupendous," "air.a:lng" are
a few of the adjectives cpplied to this
bombshell. The anti-monopoly role es
eumed by the American side has brought
them the adherence of a number of in
fluential retaUere, who were opposed to
the Imperial Tobacco Company's boycott,
and already ona firm owning many stores
in the metropolis has posted notices of its
refusal to exclude American goods.
As cabled from London March 18, the
Imperial Tobacco Company (the British
tobacco combine) had issued a eircu'.ur
offering large bonuses to its customers
who would undertake not to sell Ameri
can poods for a term of years. This Is
the American reply to tRe Imperial To
bacco. ' Company's attempt to boycott
American goods.
In a circular Ogdcn's (Limited) point
cut that the Imperial Tobacco Company's
offer to distribute a bonus amounting tj
LiA ,000 cannot be compared with the bonu-3
the retailers v/ill rective if they continue
to trade with the American amalgama
tion.
Ojrden's (Limited) to-day sent out 10,003
i telegrams from their Liverpool headquar
ters carrying the announcement of their
offer to every tobacco tradesman in Eng
land. The fact that Ogdc-n's business In
1900 amounted to nearly Â£9GS,000 indicates
the enormity cf the sum that Is expected
to be expended in bonuses. The London
tobacconists immediately called a meet
ing, for to-morrow to consider their future
action.
RESULTS OF THURSDAY'S RSCIIG IT OAKLAND TRACK
SAN JOSE, March 20.â Riding a bicycle
| upside down on a loop Xhirty feet in clr
j cumference Is what "Bunt" Smith, Hardy
I Downing and E. . A: Russell, well-known
cyclists of thi3 city, are. attempting to
master. It Is a sort of 'looping the loop"
en a bicycle, and a $2900 salary for a two
weeks' engagement with a show in San
Francisco Is the incentive that prompts
the cyclers to risk their.- lives. Hardy
13owning:, who Is the more daring of the
'men, is to do the riding. A good-sized
j model of the arrangement has been con-
I structed in the Hose Carnival Pavilion
and it works perfectly.
The struciuie is aoout 300 feet long.
From a heijjnt of, forty-eeven feet the
J rider starts down an incline of about
i forty-live degrees uniil he reaches the
loop. The velocity wiUi which the rider
1 is iroing carries him around Inside the
Â¦ ioop, \rhlch is thirty teet in circumfer
i ence. In the journey the rider makes- a
complete circle in the air. From the loop
j the rldtr is carried off on a gradual rise
j until the velocity of the wheel has spent
itself and the rider alights. The wneel
v.'orks in- a groove about one foot wide.
In vhe bottom cf the groove is a slot in
; which works a shaft with Inside
' the slot attached to the wheel to keep it
j In an upright position. The whole con
. trivance Is very strongly constructed and
I holds the wheel perfectly in position,
! In the experiments a .weighted bicycle
j has been used, but as the ordinary bicycle
I has not proved strong enough, a machine
! that is capable of carrying- half a ton is
| beins constructed. A dummy will at first
j ride the v/heel and, if the wheel makes
i the trip successfully. Downing will try if
1 The great speed of the machine, the .in
' venters figure, will keep the rider in the
saddle of the wheel when the machine Is
upside down, on -the principle that a
bucketful of water can be swung around
in tho air v.-lthout any of it being spilled.

Beatty alleged he was the owner of the
pavilion until the night of March 16. when
he was forcibly dispossessed by Peel and
an armed following, , who had since re
tained possession. The Interior of the pa
.vilion was fitted up for a circus, and to
change it for a prizefight would, it was
alleged, cause Irreparable injury to the
building. -- Â¦ â¢
The Judge ordered the petitioner to
show cause why tho injunction should ba
issued, and the. attorneys. were heard dur
ing the afternoon.
After Francoeur had been heard for the
petitioner Colonel Choynski, on behalf of
the club, made a general denial of the al
legations in the complaint. He pointed
out, that the interior had already been
transformed for the prizefight, and the
club could not be enjoined from doing a
thing which was already done. It had al
ready been decided that the proper way
to stop a prizefight was by warrant from
'the Police Courts, and not by injunction.
The pavilion had been utilized for years
for prizefights, and he ridiculed the idea
of irreparable injury being done to the
building.

lowed on the same lines. Judge Cook de
nied the writ.
The preliminary will be between "Cy

These resolutions practically send the
carpenters who attended the monster
meeting back to the unions to which they
belong pledged to obey the decision of tho
general body, to the effect that local un
ion No. 4S3 has a right to still retain Its
membership in the Labor Council. The
matter as it was adopted in the mass
meeting is not absolutely binding, but it r
shows the spirit of the carpenter* *
throughout the city in the dispute whicli
has embroiled their unions for some timo
past. In all probability at the meeting of
the unions, which will be held this week,
the resolution adopted last night will be
ratified.
When. the meeting opened C. A. Tem
pleton stepped to the platform and asked
for nominations for chairman. E. L.
Malsbury was elected by acclamation. J.
M. Burke was elected to act as secre
tary-
J. F. Grimes, representing the national
body, was called to the platform and he
addressed the mechanics in a straightfor
ward manner. He called upon them to>
obey the mandates of the United Brother
hood, and pointed out that if they did
not do so they only aroused turmoil, out
of which nothing but evil would ensue.
The committee on resolutions was then
appointed and it left the room to delib
erate. While it was outside discussing:
the situation P. H. McCarthy, represent
ing the Building Trades Council, took the
platform and presented the council's side
of the case. He offered a set of resolu
tions but they were not adopted. There
was a little excitement durins? McCarthy"* .

dignity of the meeting.

A monster mass-meetins of carpenters
and Joiners affiliated with the various un
ions of this city and Yicinity was held
last njght at Metropolitan Temple to dls- â¢
cUss the labor troubles which have arisen
out of the attitude of the Building Trades
Council and the Carpenters' District
Council toward Carpenters' Union 453.
The meeting was a spirited affair. Ail
the phases of the controversy, which was
brought about by the action of the Unite 21
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of '
America In sustaining the position taken
by union No. 4S3 in refusing to give up its
membership in the Labor Cquncil when
called upon to do so by resolutions adopt
ed "by the Building Trades Council some
time last July, were discussed. After the
matter had been fully threshed out the
carpenters assembled voted almost unan
imously to adopt resolutions agreeing to
sustain the United Brotherhood of Car
penters and Joiners of America in all Its
acts and decrees. The resolutions are as
follows:
Resolved. By the carpenters of San Fran
cisco and vicinity, members of the UnlteO
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners ot
America, that they pledge themselves to stand
loyally by and retain their msmbershlp in the
brotherhood and strictly obey the decisions of
the executive board, notwithstanding any ef
forts to force them out of the brotherhood; and
be it further
Resolved. That we hereafter refuse to strike
against members ' in good a tandlne of this

NEW YORK, March 20.â The telegram
of the manager of the Century Club to
Fitzsimmons stated the fighter would
have to accept definitely one of the bids
submitted, failing to do which the club
would cancel its â¢ offers. Fitzsimmons
shortly afterward replied to the telegram,
adhering to the stand he had originally
taken and sayfns the club could either
acquiesce or call its bids off.
The first sign of agitation against the
proposition to hold a championship fight
| in Los Angeles cropped out to-day, when
! several j ministers declared they would
I combat the plan. On this point the Cen
tury Club officials feel confident.
"There Is no danger of interference,"
said Mr. Morley. "The State law permlti
â¢ boxing contests, and we have a permit
from .the city of Los Angeles. We pro
pose to pull the fight off, that Is, If Fitz
simmons comes to time' in an orderly
manner, and no one need fear any trou
ble." â¢.-.'â¢- -
Thus the matter rests for the day wlth
.out any material progress In the negotia
tions. There will probably be a meeting
of the directors of the Century Club to
morrow.
Fitzsimmons word to-tfay that he
would accept the Los Angeles offer on
tho basis of 75 per cent of the gross re
ceipts, with a guarantee of $25,000. In re
ply to this the club stated its original
three propositions without comment.
Another telegram was received to-night
from .the ex-champion, which reads as
follows: "I stand by my proposition of
$25,000, with the privilege of 7a per cent.
Prices <K tickets and number- of compli
njentaries to be mutiially, agreed upon. If
you wish to call it off do so."
Jeffries again telegraphed Fitzsimmons,
saying there was danger of the club with
drawing its offer, ar.d that ho preferred
the 75 per cent proposition, as he though;
the fighters' share would amount to more
than $25,000. ' .
LOS ANGELES, March Â£0.â The Jeffrlea-

to their best: j Every turn went through
without a hitch and the clever work of
the wonderful animal aggregation called
for repeated applause. J

The issue involved in the increasing demand " for
an enlarged water supply becomes more urgent^ with
each succeeding year. It is important that consider- ;
ation* be. given to it at once. Far more imperative
than the question of what rates may be charged for
water is that of obtaining an ample supply, so that
there will be no. danger of a water famine even in dry
years. The matter merits the attention of capitalists
who are seeking investments. Since we are charged
to be careful of water even in a year of abundant
:a1ns like this, what will' happen when with a larger,
population than at present the city is called upon to
face a prolbaged drought' aria a winter of deficient
Under such circumstances the company has acted
wisely in trying to pffcvent waste, but that amount of
wisdom is not sufficient to; the . emergency. San
Francisco nefcds notia restricted use of;water, but a
more abundant" supply, so that the use may continue
without restriction. - â¢*
The appearance of such a request immediately after
the heavy rains of last month and in the face of good
prospects of abundant spring rains is full of signifi
cance to the people of San Francisco.. It reveals the
fact that despite all their .assertions' to the contrary
the officials of the Spring -Valley Water Company are
fearful of a deficient water supply. r . They are pot
assured- that even with the -good rains of the year
they have water enough : to meet the demands of the
city through the dry season that is to come.
The Call has no antagonism to the Spring. Valley
Water Company, but in the interests of 1 the city it
feels called upon to <5irect attention to r the seeming
inability of the- company to deal with 'the water' sup
ply problem in a proper manner. Again and again'
of late there have been evidences of the,- deficiency of â¢
the Spring Valley. supply.- Only a' short- time ago it
was shown that the company had been using water
from Point Lcbos Creek to supply a portion of the
city, notwithstanding the fact that the watershed of
the creek was contaminated, and the municipal au-;
thoritie3 were compelled to interfere before the com
pany ceased to make use of it. It is known, too, the
the Lake Merced supply is becoming deficient and
unfit for household purposes. Thus the supply of
the company is gradually diminishing/while the de
mand is steadily increasing.
BY the Spring Valley Water Company there has
been distributed through the city a card urg
ing consumers to be careful in the use of
water. The card, which is signed by . George E.
Booker, chief clerk, runs thus: "To the consumers
of Spring Valley water: You are respectfully re
quested not to use the hose to wash the sidewalk
and pavement in front of your premises, not to keep
'standing irrigators' running on your garden Â¦ and
lawn, and to have all waste stopped at once."

. FROM MAMLETâ A. A. E., 1 City. "Lay
not that flattering unction to. your soul"
Is from Shakespeare's "Hamlet," act III,
scene 4. . . .
In the inventory of the estate" it is said these loans
will, have to be putjupon "what is known to financial
people as the cat and dog list." : Just why that. name
should be given to .the loans is not clear. To the
public it would seem more appropriate .to refer to it
as'the.."aviary" 1 list,; since it is to represent money
that Huntington threw at the birds. That, however,
is-a minor matter. - fhe main point is that Talleyrand
was right in saying we should "call no man wise'un
til we have read his .letters," though in this case we
should substitute "notes" for letters. -We*; none of us
know one another. '.Mr. Huntington seems to have
been a good fellow and a -soft thing to a great many,
people after, all., :\ . .
Â¦ Such being- the well nigh universal opinion con
cerning Mr. Huntington the report that his papers
show that he loaned rpward of $2,000,000 to all kinds
of persons for all sorts of schemes without security
will have a tendency to weaken faith in popular
judgment. So far from holding his coin with a firm
grip Mr. Huntington seems to! have hardly held it
at all. In describing the various "small loans, which
in the aggregate make up "the millions of vanished
capital, the report says: "These were personal loans,
some to his friends, some to mere acquaintances and
sbme to strangers.,., Many of these claims are against
women. In fact, it-appearj that the millionaire was
peculiarly susceptible to applications to loans from
his female friends."*
x tt t HEN the late lamented Collis P.'Hunting
\/\ / ton sa'rd that no one^would ever be able to
'* Â» .track him through life by the quarters he
had dropped the world believed him, and thos.e who
thought they knew him best believed him most firmly.
No one doubted' that Collis kept a strong grip on his
coin and never let it dripple' through his fingers.
Mr. Huntington, in fact, was looked upon as a man
who practiced what he preached, a philosopher who
illustrated his teaching by his action, and not only
lured men to thrift but led the way.
; For a long, time past it has 'been foreseen that the
treaties would not be sustained by the people. There
was, however, a â¢ possibility;; that : some of them might
be- ratified by the Senate, and accordingly the coun
try wili be gratified by the announcement that they
are virtually defeated already, since it' has been deter
mined to amend them so as to require the ratification
of , both houses' of Congress. All is well that ends
well.- : V ''M ' i-; "' 'â¢
DISPATCHES from Washington report that
by way of settling the' controversy over the
right of the House to a voice in ratifying or
rejecting reciprocity . treaties the Senate/committee
will recommend the amendment of each treaty by a
provision that "this lrcatyshall not become effective
until the same shall, have been approved- by Con
gress." Such amendment, if adopted,- will put an
end to the present controversy, but will not settle the
claims of the .-House to a right to a share in the con
sideration of treaties affecting monetary questions.
The Senators, in. fact, propose to concede as^a privi
lege in this case what the House claims as a right in
all such cases. It enables the two houses to avoid an
ugly, wrangle, and, while it does not surrender any
principle contended for by the Senate," will doubtless
serve as a precedent in .similar cases arising iii the
future. â¢ .
.In another respect the proposed- amendment will
prove, a matter of high importance, for it will effec
tually put an end to the treaties. The .House will
never, ratify them, even should -the Senate be willing
to do:so. The country will be glad to have this
quietus put upon the schemes!' -The 'treaties "'"' were
not â¢-'reciprocity" treaties in accordance ; with the
definition of the term by the Republican party. .In
stead .'of providing'-, for new markets' for American
goods by ,'opening our own markets for goods not
produced, at- home, they - sacrificed some American
interests for- the sake of advancing others. In some
of the .treaties the sacrifices were very great. Thus
Senator, Aldrich,. '.in' speaking of the French treaty,
called it "a pernicious agreement" arid said that in
making . the concessions provided by its terms the
United States would obtain- from France â¢ no niore
than the ; low tariff* fates of that country which' are
unconditionally granted to other countries and
should be ours of right.
THE. END OP THE v! TREATIES;
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
NOT a large, but an interested au
dience; greeted Blanche Walsh and
her supporting company in "Janice
Meredith" yesterday afternoon at
the Columbia Theater.
The chief interest of the performance
naturally centered in \ Miss Walsh's as
sumption of the role made' so attractive
by ' Mary Mannerinjj., on her recent visit
here; -It is a part rather out of key with
Miss Walsh's repertoire, with I its strong
comedy" interest, and the opportunity, of
comparison of Miss Walsh with' herself
and with Mary Mannerlng was one to be
valued.- Her work surprised. Though In
the beginning of the play the actress
seemed out of sympathy with the part,
wanting, spontaneity and the lightness of
touch essential, she later warmed to her
work, and in the third act gave a strong
and humorously sketched-in scene that
was amply .convincing. The emotional
element, curiously enough, rather lacked
conviction, noticeably in the scene where
the rebel lover of Janice returns to her to
find himself in the very jaws of the loyal
ists, Miss Walsh quite falling to give the
atmosphere of terror. The climax of the
third act Is also rather under than over
acted, but on the whole It Is a pleasing
performance, and, though without any
imperative claim, could yet be advantage
ously Included in Miss Walsh's repertoire.
Tabitha, a pretty part, was prettily taken 1
by Miss Rose Braham, a graceful and
prepossessing young woman, who is lost

COLLIS AND^ HIS COIN.
The alert Republican press of the State perceives the danger and has given warn
ing to the public. It : is a significant fact, too, whose meaning should not be overlooked,
that certain organs that pose as representatives; of Democracy have given no warning on
the sub'ject, but tacitly support Gage and the commission scheme. Trie fight against
Gage and the corporation bosses. 'is then distinctly a /Republican fight for the honor of
the party: and the welfare of California. To the rank and file of trie party that appeal
comes. It -is for genuine .Republicans to decide whether' a Democratic railroad boss shall
be ..permitted by the aid of discredited and corrupt" schemers, posing as Republicans, to
get control,pf the party convention and dictate the. nomination of a man who if elected
will deliver the State into the hands of corporations. "That is the issue. Republicans
must attend to it. * . >ii\ .-'h Â¦ - \- ': . > :^ ' rt '
It is true 'that after the first appointment the vacancies arising from the. retire
ment of commissioners, one of whom goes out every two years, are. to be filled by elec
tion of the people, but the appointees of Gage would be in a majority, of the commission
for six years to; cbmef;- They would be clothed with authority tb fix rates for every kind
of public utility. : Local self-government so far as those things are concerned would be
utterly abolished. No city nor county nor town in the' State, would any longer have
power to regulate its service of even such local utilities as water and gas. The people
would be>absolutely subject in such matters to 1 the commission,and it is an easy prediction
that the commission would be subject to the corporations.
With such a scheme under way it is easy to understand, why the bosses who live
by the spoils of politics and the henchmen of the corporations .are working tooth and
nail' for Gage. It is easy to perceive why Herrin, though a Democrat, should be busily
engaged in co-operating with Kelly, Burns, Burke,' "Lynch and Crimmins, to procure the
renomination of the Governor by getting control of the Republican State convention.
To Herrin it is not a question of party politics, nor' indeed is it to -the others, for none
of them cares any more about Republicanism than Herrin does. With all of them it-.is a
fight for the chestnuts of political spoil, and Gage is the catspaw by which they hope to
Â¦ A peculiar feature of the amendment is triat it provides that no one shall be
eligible for membership of the' {commission who as [either directly or indirectly interested
in any of the corporations under the supervision of the commission!. That means that no
one who holds stock in any bank, express, railroad, water,. light, power^ telephone, tele
graph, insurance or other corporations of the-kind, or who is an attorney for such cor
porations, or who is even indir/ectly interested iri any of those corporations, can become
a member of- the commission. ..'. Nearly ey'ery man of business 'enterprise is debarred. The
officejis to be for politiciahs, or for men. who are willing to: commit. perjury with respect
to' their property interests,, for the purpose of holding the office. . Can: any : intelligent
man have a doubt as to what kind of tax-eaters would be appointed to the commission;
under that restricting clause, by, such a man as Gage? . ".: 'Â¦'/.:.' 'Â¦'"'
The Call and other independent -papers of the State have repeatedly directed at
tention to the. menace, contained in the proposal !to create .this autocratic commission,
but it is worth while to go /over it again/. The scheme is embodied in Avhat is known as
Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 28." Iti provides for the creation of a commisT
sion to be - appointed by the Governor, and to be composed of .five members, one;- of
whom is to hold^ office for two years, another for four, a third for six, a fourth for'eight,
and; the fifth for ten years. This commission is to have supervision and virtual control of
railrpad, sleeping-car, ex'press,,telegraph,*telephone, water, light, power, -banking and insur
ance -companies. It is to supervise and. regulatfe all their dealings with the public.
With that commission under their, control the corporations could do as they, please. The
Â¦ public would' be at the mercy of the bosses. ; : ' s J .
'X f ""Â¥.-.. T HI LE the effort of the allied fosses ;to force the renomination of Governor
Â» \ /Y / Qage": constitutes the most salient feature of ;4:heir : policy, "the public must not
I \f i \f overlook^ the fact-/ that' tiack;> of the. fight f "-for the 'Governorship there is
* another and i a bigger scheriie-^that of bringing about the creation of a State
commission clothed with' such powers as will give the bosses and the corporations who
employ them virtual control '.of all the public .utilities 'in; the ['Â¦ State; Tjie bosses desire' the
creation of this commission. wKile Gage is in office in order that ..He; may appoint their
henchmen to the places, and they are working for his renomination and re-election hr or
der to bind him to them for that and for other services.' â¢ .

ON iBTTRGLARY CHARGE
Two men were booked at the City Prison
last night on â¢ charges of burglary. One
of. them gave his name as Edward Top
ping. \ He was brought in by Detectives
Ryan and O'Dea. He was last employed
as a bellboy at the Florence Hotel on
Powell and Ellis streets, and a quantity
of jewelry and clothing belonging to the
lodgers disappeared comcidently with his
departure. Some of the plunder was re
covered at his rooms when he was ar
rested. His plan was to obtain employ
ment at a hotel and after securing knowl
edge of the premises quit work. Subse
quently he would return and rob the
rooms. Several downtown lodging-houses
where he obtained situations suffered
from his depredations. A bunch of about
fifty keys was found in ! his possession
when he was arrested. He had an accom
plice, whom the police expect to capture
in a short time. ' ; .".â¢Â¦-
James Flannerywas the second burglar
and he was arrested by the same detec
tives. He is accused of stealing laundry
bundles from the Electric Laundry on
Folsom street, near fourth. The propri
etor claims that he has lost laundry for
several years past, the amount which
he had to refund to his customers reach-
Ing the sum of $7000. When Flannery was
captured he had in his possession a bun
dle of laundry valued at $10, which had
been taken from the Electric Laundry.
Entrance was gained by unlocking the
door to the room where the bundles were
left for the drivers to deliver.
"Statements are accredited bv this
company to the field assistants and pur
porting to come from bureau reports that
are grossly incorrect," said Mr. Aubury.
The attention of the United States pos
tal authorities will be called by. the State
Mineralogist to advertising matter pass-
Ing from this State through the mails, in
which false and misleading statements
are made for the purpose of persuading
parties dwelling abroad to buy mining
stocks.
In his search for information concern
ing the representations made by minlnjj
companies in their literature Mineralogist
Aubury said ttiat he also took exception
to misleading statements that have been
made in a prospectus issued by the Min
aret Mining, Milling and Smelting Com
pany, with ofHces in the Flood building in
this city. . â¢
Mineralogist Aubury says that the use
of the name of the State Mining Bureau
on the literature is misleading. Fred C.
Mathyas is quoted under date of Decem
ber 8, 1890, as assistant of the State Min
ing Bureau, as making statements con
cerning the Sunset Mining Company prop
erty. Mr. Mathyas was not in the bureau
at that time and had not been for two
years previously. '
In the literature of the 'Sunset Mining-'
Company several enterprises are adver-'
Used in very glowing terms. Among these
is the Sunset mine, which, it is promised
will pay 24 per cent per annum; the Amer- I
lean Mining, Milling and Melting-Com-
pany, which promises 180 per cent per
annum; the Lomaii- Gold Mining Com
pany, which offers 75 per cent per an
num profit, and the American Land, Cat
tle and Mining Company, which is adver
tised to have paid dividends of from 50
to 175 per cent per annum since the second
year of its formation.
Of the numerous claims which the Sunset
Mining Company reports to be working only
one was found to be In operation, this being
the Old Glory, which is abdut four miles from
Oroville. *A deed has passed to the Sunset
Mining Company for this property, but the
owner of the claim holds a mortgage to secure
payment of the purchase price, which price Is
reported to be $6000. Some locations have
been made there, but no development work has
been performed upon them. While a number
of men are employed on the Old Glory mine
no evidence can be found that the property is
fabulously rich.
Only One Property Working.
IJ Is reported to me by my representative
that . the Amo, which Is represented In the
literature of the Sunset Mining Company as
being an active hydraulic mine, has not been,
in â¢ operation for a year and before that it
was operated only to a limited extent. .The
literature represents that thin property was
operating under a special United States Gov
ernment license and was most successfully
working. The values found In this claim are
reported to me to be insufficient to pay operat
ing expenses, much less enormous dividends.
It is also represented in the company's liter
ature that the company has a 'dredger iu opera,
tlon near Orovllle. It Is reported by my rep
resentative that no dredger can be found on
the iiver belonging to the company, but the
company has some land there. It was inti
mated to my representative by responsible
parties residing near Oroville that G. \V. Rum
ble, the manager of the Sunset Mining Com
pany, had photographs taken of the Conti
nental dredger and of another dredger belong
ing to other Dartles and that the same had
been represented to be the property of the
Sunset Mining Company.
Not Operating Amo Mine.
State Mineralogist Aubury said yester
day that he had found out, through a re
sponsible man whom he sent to Orovllle
to Â¦ investigate, that there are several un
true representations made In the litera
ture sent out by the Sunset Mining Com
pany. This . company has been brought
into some local | prominence in the last
few days by the attempt of W. H. Jordan
to get a peep at the corporation books.
State Mineralogist :Auoury. received . in
quiries some time ago from Europe con
cerning the Sunset Mining Company. He
sent to the Chronile building to get some
of the literature of the company.. In this
he failed, although he dispatched several
messengers. There were two girls in the
ofBce, but they denied that the company
had any literature to give out. The State
Mineralogist then wrote to Paris and se
cured what he wanted, and then he sent
a representative to Oroville to investigate
into the truth of the assertions published
by the company for the purpose of selling
stock. Mr. Aubury said to a Call reporter
yesterday:

The burglar, after a moment's hesita
tion, put up his , hands; passed by Vas
quez and ran into the street. .'Investiga
tion showed that the door had been forced
with a "Jimmy" and that the crook was
about to enter the house when its owner
surprised him. The police believe the
man to have been one of the gang whose
numerous operations within the past four
weeks have terrorized North Beach.
..Raymond Vasquez. proprietor of, the El
Dorado saloon at 1321 Dupont street, en
countered - a burglar early yesterday
morning, who was forcing an entrance to
his home at 808 Union street. When. the
thief found that he had been Interrupted
he was about to make an attack upon t\ie
saloonkeeper, but the latter, being armed,'
drove off the intruder at the point of a'
revolver. , - , - .
Vasquez closed his place of business
shortly after midnight and walked to liia
home. As he turned Â¦ into a small alley
which runs alongside the house he . ob
served the form of a man prying open a
door that leads into the basement. i~ '
Clutching a revolver which he carried In
his overcoat pocket Vasquez advanced,
and his footsteps soon alarmed the bur

SACRAMENTO, March 20.â Governor Gage
has granted the application of Major Frank
MeLaughlin, the well-known Republican poli
tician, lor retirement from the Governor's
Btaff with rank as lieutenant colonel. Mc-
Laughlin made , application through Adjutant
General . Stone for retirement under the terms
<Sf subdivision 3 of section 1973 of the Political
Code., which provides - that â¢ an ofneer In the
State who haa served continuously eight yeara,
cr non-contlnuously ten years, . may retire on
application and retain the title which' he had
at the time the application was filed. Accord
ingly, thoupth no longer a member of i the 1 Gov
ernor's staff, Mclaughlin retains the title of
lieutenant colonel. Â¦ -
Frank McLaughlin, who was chairman
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee during the campaign of 1898, which
culminated in the election of Gage, has in
effect resigned from the Governor's staff.
Other applications for retirement would
cause no surprise in political circles. The
following message was received last
night: â¢ . - '?.v----y:
Betires From Governor's Staff.
A trio of fluent oratora will leave San
Francisco this evening for Los Angeles.
Ihe trio ' consists of Duncan McKinlay,
Assistant United States District Attor
ney; Samuel M. Shortridge and George
A. Knight. They will address the Young
Men's Republican League of Los An
geles to-morrow night. Mr. McKinlay
goes south to speak with .the Â¦ knowledge
that the Department of Justice, "Washing
ton, D. C, is willing that he shall fulfill
his engagements to address the people of
Los Angeles and San Jose. The subject
of Mr. McKinlay's address for to-mor
row night is "Industrial America." Sam
uel M. Shortridge will speak of "Western
Diplomacy." The subject was handed
out to him and he had no hesitancy in
taking hold of the theme. An orator of
Mr. Shortridge's well-known versatility
cares little what the subject may be so
long -as- he is assured that the occasion
is auspicious and .the audience eager for
eloquence. When George Knight arrives
at the scene of the speaking to-morrow
evening the committee will give him a
suitable topic for his style of oratory.
Judge F. M. Angellotti of Mar in County
Is commended as a worthy candidate for
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
His long term of service on the Superior
bench qualifies him for higher judicial
honors. Judge John F. Ellison of Teha
ma County, another lawyer of superior
attainments, will be sustained by friendly
delegations in the convention.. -
It was subsequently ascertained that he
decided the question in Los Angeles be
fore the arguments were submitted in
San Francisco. It Is just possible that
the Supreme Court may need a member
possessing his decisive qualities, but it is
the general public notion that a question
ought not to be decided before it is sub
mitted for .decision.
How 3>ecision Was Reached.
Many leading Republicans favor the
plan of placing first in the order of busi
ness nominations for , Chief Justice and
Associate Justices of the Supreme Court.
The suggestion Is made with the view of
separating the judicial nominations from
trades and combines of the State ticket.
It is quite well known throughout the
State that there .will be an animated con
test for the nomination of Chief- Justice
between Beatty and Garoutte. It is main
tained that this contest should be settled
on its merits without any regard what
ever to the gubernatorial contest. Word
comes from Shasta County . that Judge
Edward M. Sweeny, who was formerly
mentioned as a. slated candidate for Asso
ciate Justice, will not figure conspicuous
ly in the race. :Messages come from Los
Angeles to the effect that Judge McKin
ley Is displaying considerable activity a3
a candidate for Associate Justice. Judge
Lucien Shaw is a lawyer of the south
who seems to possess the confidence of
the public, but he will not consent to
make a fight for the favor of the nomi
nating convention. Judge McKlnley is a
programmer of the raw sort/ He acted as
Gage's agent In obtaining, from the Re
publican State Central Committee a vote
indorsing Crimmlns' County Committee.
The readiness in ' which he produced a
voluminous tj;pe-written report within
two minutes after the controversy was
submitted to a sub-committee over which
he presided excited the wonder of thÂ«j
general body..
Senator Cutter figures that the conven
tion will consist of 700 delegates. 1 He es
timates that the machine strength will be
less than 300. Â¦
Figures" on Convention.
Cutter frankly avows his opposition to
the renomlnation , of Governor Gage and
expresses a purpose to fight to a finish on
this line. He entertains the opinion' that
'the members of the State committee
should be called together in May and that
they should adopt a resolution requiring
that all delegates to the convention shall
be chosen by the people at primary elec
tions. In. other words, ..he 1 is opposed to
the plan of allowing ccrtmty committees to
appoint delegates, to the State convention.
He proposes . to introduce . at the next
meeting of the State committee^or tho
executive body thereof, a resolution pro
viding that appointed delegates shall not
be entitled to seats in the convention.
Cutter's idea is that the nominating con
vention should emanate from the people
and voice the will of the people. '
Senator Cutter, who Is- known as one of
the cleverest politicians in the Republican
party, is confident that the machine ele
ment behind Gage will not be able to mus
ter a sufficient number of delegates to or
ganize the convention.
Under the law the primary election for
delegates to the party conventions must
be held on Tuesday, August 12. Senator.
W..M. Cutter of Yuba, secretary of the
Republican State Central Committee, fan
cies that the Republican convention
should assemble on Monday, August 25.
Present indications point to Sacramento as
the place for holding the convention. The
State Fair, however, will open on Septem
ber 8, and a few days' time in advance
of the opening will be required to put the
pavilion in order for the industrial . expo
sition. Â¦;

Most hair preparations are merely scalp j
irritants, miscalled hair tonics. When hair
is brittle, lusterless and begins to fall out
the dandruff germ is getting in its deadly
work at the root, sapping the vitality.
Since science discovered that dandruff is
a germ disease there has been only one
preparation put on the market that will
actually destroy the dandruff germ, and
that Is Ne-wbro's Herpicide. It allays

The, work of the Zionist Congress In
Basle, Switzerland, and the Dreyfus affair

and he also referred to the < fact that
England had wiped out the Boer, republic
.where the Jews had not received civil
rights at the hands of those who claimed
ito be lighting for liberty and justice.

The persecution of, the Jews in many
portions of Europe formed the basis of
the plea of Atorney Wise for 3upport to
the Zion Society. He vividly described the
awful conditions under which millions of
Jews were forced to live in Europe and
that the hope of their, salvation was to
return them to Palestine. 'The speaker
claimed that there was indifference shown
by the Jews in America nnd England to
the needs of'thetr brothers and sisters in
the ghettos of Europe. The sum of $5,000,
000 is now in a London bank, subscribed
for the purchase of land In Palestine.
He described the success of thirty-four
colonies of Jews founded in Palestine in
the past twenty years and pointed out
that at the present time 23,000 Jews were
living in contentment and happiness in
the Palestine colonies.

The organization of the new body which
Is to promote immigration to the Califor

gun. Upon the part of the State Board of
7rade the following five members of the
committee on promotion have been ap
pointed: N. P." Chipman, representing the
Sacramento Valley; Arthur S. Briggs,
representing the San Joaquin Valley; C.
M. Wooeter, for the south coast counties;
E. D. Sweetzcr. for the north coast coun
ties, and W. H. Mills, for San' Francisco.
The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
has appointed Rufus P. Jennings as its
member of the committee. Charies Bund
echu has been selected by the Merchants'
Association.
j There is a gTeat deal of stir about the
rooms of the State Board of Trade rela
tive to the large work that. Is about to be
undertaken. All sorts of propositions
have already been made t to Manager
Filcher. ranging from offers to give lec
tures in the East and elsewhere for the
purpose of advertisng the resources of
the northern and central counties to a
scheme for bringing In negro colonists
from the Southern States. As there is no
Â©rganlzation for the new work perfected
as yet all offers are of no utility for the
present, except as showing the live pub
lic Interest and belief In the success of
the plans in view.
â¢ Two conventions have already been pro
posed. One of these is suggested by C. M.
Woostcr of Santa. Clara County, who will
cend out Invitations to the real estate
men of all the leading tovrns and cities
In the interior and coast counties to ex
press their wish concerning a meeting to
discuss the situation, that there may be
concerted action. M. J. Dillman. chair
man of the Sacramento County Board of
Supervisors, has moved to have a conven
tion called of the Supervisors of all the
counties of the Sacramento Valley and
tht tributary counties to that territory
for the purpose of seeing what pledges
they are willing to make of the funds at
their 'disposal for the encouragement of
Immigration. Including the making of an

effort on the part of the boys. The little
vocalists are determined to surpass their

TACOMA, March 20.â Papers' have been
prepared in Whatcom for what promises
to be one of the most novel suits ever
before an American court. The plain
tiff will be a prominent business man of
Whatcom and the suit will be instituted
by him to recover from a telephone com
pany for time lost in trying to at
tract the central office's attention in the
use of the telephone system. Recovery
is sought on that portion of his contract
with the company which ajrrees to give
him prompt and effective service. His
complaint sets forth tkat "his business
calls for free use of the. telephone sys
tem, and that by reason of the antiquated
system in use and the inattention or over
working of employes he is often com
pelled to try for long periods of time,
ranging from three to fifteen minutes, tq
secure the desired connections."
Plaintiff then . goes on to make some
calculations as to the time lost, and
finds it to be so much that hl3 working
hours are seriously broken into. The aid
of the courts therefore is invoked to com-
I>el the company to make a proper settle

to ascertaining just what railroads would

proposed proceeding. One purpose of the
visit was to try to Induce the Government
to include all railroads centering in Kan

was urged that by bo doing the situation
would be placed within the grasp of the
Government, whereas this would not be
accomplished by proceeding against a
pert of the roads.
Although absolutely nothing has been
eaid by any representative of the Gov

generally that if a bitter fight is made
egainst the injunctlonal proceedings the
Government will Institute criminal pro

including packing-house representatives.

THEJDAY'S DEAD,
NEW YORK, March 20.â Hardman.
Peck & Co.. piano manufacturers, suffer
ed a loss of 5300,000 or possibly more, by
the destruction to-night by fire of their
plant located at West Forty-eighth street
and the North River. The rire started
from some unknown cause in the packing
room, which is in the three-story part of
the big factory. Thence it quickly spread
throughout the entire building. The roof
of the building fell in soon afterward and
gave rise to the report that there had been
an explosion. Just west of the three
story building, which was about 100 feet
in length and right on the river front,
stood a frame stable. On the roof of this
were a number of the firemen. When
the walls fell a lot of debris fell on the
roof of the stable, injuring 1 one fireman
and one spectator.
From the first-mentioned building the
fire spread to the firm's five-story struc
ture and worked to the upper portion of
it. The loss was mainly because of the
valuable machinery and woods burned.

Medical Examiner Draper reported the
death as due to an accident. Mrs. French,
who was 70 years of age and lived alone,
apparently fell from the third floor in
the well to the elevator canopy. Mrs.
French is said to have had more lawsuits
brought against her and had appeared as
plaintiff more times than any other per
son appeared in public. The litigation
territory extended from the Atlantic Coast
to the Rocky Mountains. She had such
a tendency toward going to law that In
November, 1900, Dr. B)bomer, superinten
dent of the' Butler Insane Asylum at Prov
idence R. I., testified as an expert that
Mrs. French wa& afflicted with "litigious
paranoia."
Her most important lawsuit related to
the will of her second husband,
French, and involved not only her right
to the estate, but the question of her san
ity. The case was full of sensational fea
tures, but was decided in her favor.
Among other famous lawsuits in which
Mrs. French was involved was one which
caused . her to leave Colorado for the East.
She sued a Denver firm over a disputed
Bill and a counter action of $20,000 on the
ground of malicious prosecution was
brought. The firm obtained a verdict of
$4600, and then swore out a warrant
charging Mrs. French with perjury.
Mrs. French eluded the Sheriff ' and
started East. She reached Omaha, was
arrested, but. secured her relca.se on a
Â¦writ of habeas corpus. When she reached
Mendota, 111., an officer boarded the train
and tried to force her to leave the car at
Aurora. She declared that no official in
the State of Illinois had authority over
her. Mrs. French sprained her ankle but
won the struggle and continued on her
way to Boston.
BOSTON, March 20.â Mrs. Julia B.
French, wealthy, eccentric and famous
throughout the country because of her
many and varied lawsuits," was found
dead in her Back Bay residence thh>
afternoon. Her body, badly disfigured,
lay on top of the elevator, which was on
the basement floor, and had evidently
been there three or four days.
Clough said he never knew of any ar
rangement between Harriman, Morgan,
Hill and others subsequent to May 1, 19-31,
by which Morgan was to- be given the
proxy of Harriman in the Union Pacific
in exchange for Harriman being placed
on the boards of the Northern Pacific and
the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy.
The next witness was A. P. Clough.
vice president and a director of the
Northern Securities Company. He said
the transfer of about 500,000 shares of
Great Northern stock to the Northern Se
curities Company had been completed.
and that negotiations were pending for
cbout SOO.OOO or 400,000 shares more. There
were 1,250,000 shares of Great Northern in
existence, he said. Of Northern Pacific
Etock $150,000,000 par value had been
turned over to the Northern Securities
Company.
The witness said he had no knowledge
of any such transactions. Lancaster also
asked for a list of all the members of
the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. The list
was handed him. A conference ensued,
during which it was suggested that sub
penas might be issued for some of the
members or for all.
"Do you know the firm of J. P. Morgan
& Co. acquired eixteen to eighteen mil
lion dollars 1 worth of Northern Pacific
etock between May 1 and 9. 1901?" Mr.
Perkins was asked by Judge Lancaster.
The object of the suit is to prevent the
oi.eration of the Northern Pacific by the
Northern Securities Company. His firm,
he said, was a purchaser of Northern Pa
cific between May l and May 9 last year,
but how much v.-as bought he did not
know. Neither did he know how much
of the 6tock J. P. Morgan & Co. held on
May 1, 190L Perkins saidJ. P. Morgan &
Co. bought about $77,000,000 of Northern
Pacific stock from Union Pacific interests
efter the Northern Securities Company
was formed in November. About $10,000,
000 was paid in cash and the rest was to
be paid for In stock of the Northern Se
curities Company.
After taking the stock from* the Union
Pacific J. P. Morgan & Co sold it to the
Northern Securities Company, receiving
loi the same $10,000,000 in cash and more
in stock. The cash, received from the
Northern Securities Company was equal
to the sum paid the Union Pacific inter
ests. Perkins said that at the time of the
purchase of the stock by his firm there
was no agreement in existence with the
Northern Securities Company in reference
to the disposal of the Northern Pacific
stock. He said his firm simply acted as
brokers in the transaction. In case the
stock was not disposed of to the Northern
Securities Company it would have been
turned back to the Union Pacific inter
ests. Perkins said he did not know
whether or not J. P. Morgan & Co. owned
any of the stock of the Great Northern
Railway during the summer and autumn
of 1S39, and he did not know how much
Great Northern stock the firm owned
now. Â¦

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, March 20.
Captain A. H. Payson. assistant to Pres
ident Ripley of the ISanta Fe system, in
response to the Invitation of President
Schaffer, appeared before the City Coun
cil to-night and told the members of that
body and a large number of citizens the
intentions of the Santa Fe Kanroad Com
pany. In the most torceful language pos
sible he informed the - city tnat the raii
ruad he represents is coming into Oakland
just as soon as ail legal complications are
cleared away and the necessary materials
can be had to build the gap between Point
Richmond and Oakland.
Accompanied by W. A. Bissell, trade
manager of the Santa Fe, Edward Stearns
and one or two other olticiala of the com
peting road, Captain Payson came into
the council chamber at s o'clock. Tno
Council was ready to meet him and Predi
aent Scharter called the members to or
der, announcing the purpose of the meet
ing. Captain Payaon was then invited to
teii about the Santa Fe's projects.
"It has been the Intention of the Santa
Fe," he said, "to come into Oakland ever
since it acquired the Valley Railroad. It
has simply been a question of means â
how to accomplish the desired end. We
found that the best way to reach the city
limits was by acquiring the. California
and Nevada Railroad, and we have ac
quired it. The papers by means of which
that road will be turned over to the Santa
Fe are being prepared now. So soon as
they are ready it will be ours.
Want Right of Way.
""We are , working In conjunction with
Oakland capitalists to acquire a right of
way/ through the city. This Is why the
Oakland and East Side Railway was or
ganized. It was found to be a good deal
easier to make headway by asking for a
franchise and rights of way with the aid
of local men of influence, and we have
proceeded along those lines. It has done
away with many complications and much
possible opposition.
"This is altogether a business proposi
tion with us. Oakland is a big city and
we, want a share of tha freight that it
imports and exports. We are competi
tors of the Southern Pacific in a good
many places in California and we might
as weli be here.
Council Approves Address.
"We don't promise to give any particu
lar kind of a service, but I think that the
Santa Fe has the name of always giving
the best. We could not afford to give
any oL^l-. But we ask you, If you give
us this franchise, not to hamper us and
burden us with a lot of arduous condi
tions. That will do neither of us. any
good. We had a hard enough time get
ting the lease of China Basin from tho
Harbor Commissioners. They wanted us
to do a great many things that were
really unnecessary, and the result 13 that
it has hampered us not a little. I say to
you, let the tree grow and cultivate it."
Captain Payson's address met with tha
approval of the Councilmen and the
crowded lobby, which cheered him lustily*
Mayor Sarstow was called upon to say
something.
"I say, give us railroads!" was all he
would say.
The Council took a recess of thirty min
utes, ancKn the meantime the Ordinance
and^Jtiaiciary Committee considered the
application of the Oakland and East Sid*
Railroad for a franchise. The committee
unanimously passed the following recom
mendation: Â«flB|HIHM
"That a resolution fixing April 7 to hear
the petition and application of the Oak
land â and . East .Side Railroad Company
and petitions and applications of prop
erty-owners to grant said company a
franchise be adopted."
The resolution was also introduced and
adopted unanimously by the Council. Tha
franchise is now certain to be granted the
new company, as the Council is a unit in
favor of It and no opposition is expected
from property-owners whose property
will be touched by the railroad.

land, Says Bipley.
There will not be a Santa Fe ferry be
tween Oakland and San Francisco.
President E. P. Rlpley of the Atchison.
Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad arrived in
the city last evening from. Santa Barbara
and is stopping for a few days at the
Palace Hotel.
"If, through the Oakland and East Side
Railroad, we can get the right kind of
a franchise," he said, "the Santa Fe will
certainly come into Oakland. Oakland is
a city of 100,000 inhabitants. It is growing
and I think a terminal there will be mu
tually advantageous."
One point upon which President Rlpley
expressed himself freely and emphatically
was the talked of Santa Fe ferry between
Oakland and San Francisco. Said he:
"We are not going: Into the ferry busi
ness from Oakland. You may take that
as official and final. Our Point Richmond
ferry we will continue to operate, but our
operations In that line will be confined to
the Point Richmond-San Francisco
route."
President Rlpley has been spending sev
eral weeks at Santa Barbara. . He will
remain here a few days and may go south
again before returning to Chicago.

Charles Keeler, was next introduced and
delivered an interesting and instructive
address on "The Art Spirit in Our Schools
â Art Tendencies in California," He said
all the arts are elevating, refining and
spiritualizing: that art is not, merely
painting, sculpture, architecture, music
and poetry. He added that the first thing
to create in the school room was an art
atmosphere. He continued:

p=-rj-Â«^HE second day's session ' of the
I teachers' annual institute, which Is
I 1 being held in the Mission High
iX School, proved as interesting yes
terday as on the opening day. The
attendance was just as large, it being
compulsory', for the teachers to attend
these sessions. '" .
At the opening of the second day a large
class of boys and girls from the Agassiz
School, under the leadership of Miss Ada
M. Jcsselyn, rendered ."Whip-poor- Will,"
by French; "Bye-bye-bye," Clayton-
Jon^s; "Annie Laurie," Lady: JanÂ©. Scott.
The singing was very beautiful and was
greatly appreciated by the assembly. The
children possessed well trained voices, ajid
their work redounded to the credit' of
their leader. Miss Josselyn. As an encore
they rendered a selection from Donizetti's
"Lucia." When the children marcned off
the stage the teachers, tendered them an
ovation. The applause lasted fully five
minutes and Chairman Webster had to
recall the class to render another selec
tion." -

"Faust"- Is the greatest book and has taught
us more Â¦ that is worth ; knowlnsr in the nine
teenth : century than any other work.
Professor | Gayley read selections from
"Faust" and analyzed ; them. In con
cluding the lecture, the speaker said:
Evolution Â¦ proves what 'Goethe long ago de
clared,: that nature dees not. follow byways,
nor go In fits and starts. God was, according
to Goethe,. In "nature from the beginning. He
was there alive/ alone, active and sufficient. -
Our poet must be the ' poet .of evolution
it 'Â¦ he Is to be the - poet of this' century.
Goethe was the greatest poet of the nineteenth
century and "Faust" is the greatest poem.
The first -part of "Faust" was published in
1808, and it was written continuously for
sixty years.' Goethe gave up his life writing
this . zreat poem.,;. - Â¦ Â¦
Professor Charles Mills Gayley. M. A..
LL. D.,- of. the University of California,
delivered air interesting address. on "The
Greatest Book of the "Nineteenth Cen
tury." He discussed the works of poets
and prose writers. Ruskin's writing, he
said,- was flabby and declared that he bor
rowed his Ideas from Germany. He said
Emerson got his ideas from Carlylo and
the latter borrowed them from Germany.
He &ald Cardinal Newman was the great
est religious thinker of the nineteenth
century. In dwelling on Tennyson he said
"In Memoriam" was not the greatest
poem of the nineteenth century. He said
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" was written for a
purpose and had the largest sale of any
novel written in the last century. The
speaker discussed, the works of Balzac,
Tolstoi and Hugo and .commented on
them. : He said further:

'It Is a gratifying evidence of the progressive

: "The .True and the False in- Education"
was the' subject of an address -by J.. P.
Blanton, LL. D., late Dean of the De

preciated. When he concluded he was re
called and bowed his pleasure. : The ad
dress! was followed by singing. A trio
composed of Miss Katheryn Black,
Messrs. 8. J. Sandy and David Manlloyd
rendered a number of selections.
He told of an Ideal school In Berkeley.
He described the way it was decorated
and how the principal had arranged moth

these I meetings had on the teachers and
how. the children were benefited. He sub

M*-s. gunford attempted to make a dis
position of her fortune similar to that
contemplated by Fair. She appointed

heirs. When two cf the legatees named
ehould have reached the age of 25 years
the property was ordered conveyed.
The lower court declared the will valid

Charles Sanford. an heir at law, appealed
from the decree, advancing- practicaily
the same arguments as those employed

Members of the Native Sons of the
Golden West are making active prepara
tions for the Grand Parlor to be held in
tlanta. Crui on April 28. 1902.
Delegates are being elected by the vari
e>us parlcrs and candidates for the various
offices to be elected are declaring them
eclves daily. The office about which there
appears to be no doubt is that of Grand
President, to which Lewis F. Byington
Â¦will succeed by the unwritten law on pro
motion in the order. H. R. McNoble of
Stockton will undoubtedly be elected to
be Grand Vice-Presldent and Judge
Charles M. McLaughlin of Plumas will
fill the Grand Second Vice-Presidency
during the next term. No one doubts that
Henry Martin will succeed himself as
Grand Treasurer and Henry Lundstedt
will continue to serve as Grand Secretary.
Two candidates for the office of Grand
Third Vice-President have already ap
peared la James L. Gallagher and William

Gallagher's election. He has attended

The committee referred the matter to
the City Attorney to determine whether
the charter or the act of March 11, 1901.
governs in the granting of such a fran
chise.
Cohen explained that the city would get
fifty free telephones, one duct, one cross
arm on overhead line and 2 per cent of
the gross receipts. It wg.s intended to in
stall direct lines only, and no party lines.
King said he could not divulge the
names of the promoters, but said the
company is fighting the Bell Company.
"I am willing to put up a bond of $50,
009," said King. "I have sufficient capital,
and will put in the latest system. Our
rates are based on 15,000 telephones. "When
we get 23,000 our rates will be 512 per
month on all direct lines. We are build
ing systems in every large city. We agree
to spend $25,000 in. eight months. $50,000 . in
twelve months and $150,000 in twenty-four
months. I represent Eastern capital, and
we have made 4000 contracts in Los An
geles."
M. Adrian King appeared before the
committee with his attorney, Alfred
Cohen, to urge the granting of his petition
for a franchise to operate and maintain
a telephone and telegraph system in this
city.

John Aubrey Jones offered to sell to the
city a lot on Van Ness avenue, between
Fulton and Grove streets, 275x214 feet, as
a site for the library. . Formal action on
the matter was postponed by the com
mittee until the nzxi meeting.
. EL B. Pond, representing the Merchants'
Association, favored the Lincoln School
property, as did S. C. Irving, president of
the Mechanics' Institute.
Chairman Braunhart explained that the
gift had already been accepted by resolu
tion of the Board of Supervisors, and the
acceptance could not be recalled. Super
visors Wynn and Loughery expressed
themselves as beins- opposed to taking
money from Carnegie, but the committee
decided to make no recommendation on
the matter to the board.
Walter Macarthur addressed the com
mittee in support of the resolutions, and
said that the acceptance of the gift would
be a disgrace in view of the persistent ef
forts of Carnegie to degrade the laboring
man.
Opposes Acceptance of Gift.
The committee teamed for the first
time that the laboring Interests are op
posed to the acceptance of the gift of
fered by Carnegie. .Secretary Ed Rosen
berg of the Labor Council presented a
set of resolutions condemning: the action
of ex-Mayor Phelan in soliciting financial
aid from Carnegie and urging that the
offer to build the library be not ac
cepted. ;.
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee met yesterday for the purpose of
selecting a site for the 5750,000 library of
fered to this city by Andrew Carnegie.
Immediate action Is necessary, as the Me
chanics* Institute has withdrawn its offer
to sell the Mechanics' Pavilion property to
the city for $650,000. A new and available
site which seems to strike the committee
favorably is the Lincoln School property,
at the corner of Fifth and Market streets.
This'site will undoubtedly be selected by
the committee, as it will do away with the
necessity of issuing bonds for the'acqui
sition of the land.

Percy Hutchison Has Nettie Eyley
Arrested and Booked for
Kobb3ry.
Nettle Ryley, a middle-aged woman,
who was known around the i tenderloin
several years ago, was arrested yesterday
afternoon by Detective Riordan and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
robbery. She Is accused by Percy Hutch
inson of being the stout, blonde woman
decoy for two footpads who robbftd him
on Post street, near Leavenworth, last
Friday night. . â¢
Hutchinson identified her by her general
appearance, but more particularly by a
wedding ring she wears on the third fin
ger of her. left hand. She ia a stout
woman of fair complexion and fair hair,
turning gray. The bartender at the saloon
on Post and Taylor streets, where Hutch
inson said he had several drinks with the
woman prior to the robbery, failed to
identify Nettie at the City Prison. She
denied positively that she was the woman
footpad, and says she can prove a com
plete alibi by friends at whose house she
was stopping that night. She was released
on $1000 cash bail. " '
The police do not place much credence
in Hutchlnson's identification, as he has
suspected a number of ladies who are
eminently respectable. During the strike
Hutchinson drove a truck and had one of
his arms broken by a blow from a piece
of pipe.

of air and. water would benefit me; five
months ago the bleeding piles came back
on me, and bled so much that I thought
I .would die. I have had, four of the
finest doctors in this section of Texai:
all they did was to finally nearly let me
go to my grave; all they wanted was a
big sum of money from me and to op-
erate on me. I said no; no surgeon's
knife would enter me; if it was my tlma
to die God knew it, and when I died I
would die all together. I began* hear-
ing about your ' medicine/ I had no
faith in you, but I sent and got a box
of your Pyramid Pile- Cure; In two days
the blood flow/ hid slackened to one-half
the 'amount, and in one week I felt so
much better 'I walked four blocks and
did a little housework. I was not bleed-
ing, then; in three weeks I was well.
God bless you for putting such a won-
derful medicine within the reach of suf-
fering men and women. I shall never
cease to recommend your medicine or
be without it; also I used your Pyramid
Pills. Sallie A. Hearndon." Testimony

CHICAGO. March 2O.-There was a general
landslide In grains before noon' led by wheat
Rains in the West and Southwest smashed
prices. Corn was weaker on the warm weather
and Southwest selling and oats felt panicky for
a time. Wheat opened easy on cables and the
weather, but was met with fair support for a
time. A fair number of buying orders were
executed but. soon came the slump In the
Southwest. Kansas City and St. Louis were
earnestly bearish and prices, in those markets
were rapidly slipping off. - .At one time St.
Louis was 2%c. under yesterday's May closing
price. The local crowd here -who had been
taking in some stuff, turned about - - to sell
Longs liquidated ; stop-loss orders were met'
causing still further weakness, and before May
had stopped on Its downward course almost le
was lost. Speculators overlooked bull news
Liverpool continued steady at a small decline'
seaboard- clearances, were large and fecelDts
were small. Statisticians reported the croD in
a less favorable position. . There was a better
continental demand reported early and millers
were reported largo buyers of May. Notwith
standing these conditions the weather seemed
all powerful. May, which Â¦ opened uÂ«Â«i P
lower at 74@73%c. sold off to 73%c
came some covering and the break was'etODDed
The big Influence, however, .came ' later in tho
shape of reports that wheat was on an export
basis. May wheat shot up to a steady clos*
a ehade higher, at 74%@74%c. ! "* ?Â¦
Corn, like wheat, had a firm support the
first hour, theiv a sharp break. This market
was Influenced largely by the bearish feelina
in the Southwest. May closed easy. V.c down
at 60%@61c. * /A 0Wn>
Speculation in May oats was extremely ner
vous, and was hammered down l%c. At this
time large quantities were unloaded , Again
the market was comparatively strong * Mav
closed easy, %c lower at 43%c. / Â¦ - .
In spite of a large run of hogs, a lower ho*
market and the -depression. In grains nro
vlslons held up strongly. May pork closed 10c
higher, ribs 6c up and lard 5c higher. -

NEW YORK, March 20. â The so-called spec
ialties etlll occupied the largest share of at
tention in the rtock market to-day. Their
movements were not quite so wide nor so
feverishly active as yesterday, but there was
et!!l an eccentric irregularity in this, portion
of the market. As for the standard stocks
that usually make up the bulk of the trading
by reason of their large capitalization and rep
resentative character they were- neglected -and
sluggish tts for some time past. There was
some heaviness among the anthracite carriers,
but the declines in that group were limited
to fractions and -good recoveries were made.
There was rood support In St. Paul without
any explanation for- the buyins:, which gave
rise to the supposition that, the support was
part of the plan to facilitate the operations
of speculative pools elsewhere in the market.
Colorado Fuel was again a conspicuous figure
and touched yesterday's hleh level again at
1C7,' closing with a net caln of 4% after a
"â¢â¢ery erratic course during the day. Tbl*
movement seemed to have a sympathetic effect
on Tennessee Coal and Hocking Coal, but the
United States Steel stocks continued neglected
and heavy as they have been ever eince the
proposed bond Issue which was announced.
Sugar was sold early on professed disappoint
ment over the terms of the bill for reducing
the Cuban sugar tariff, but later it rose strong
ly and closed with & net gain of a point.
Amalgamated Copper continued quite active
and was bought by the shorts to cover, re
sulting In a net gain of about a point. At
tempts to market some* stocks recently bought
at high prices made broad inroads on those
prices on. very email sales. There was a con
cpicuous demand for Chicago Union Traction
and International Power and the newly listed
corn product stocks were advanced more than
a point over their first sale price. The local
tractions advanced In response to the announce,
ment of the favorable action of stockholders
In the Brooklyn Transit Company and the
Metropolitan Street Railway Company upon
the proposed capital readjustments. The rise
of 3% in Long Island seemed to be In sym
pathy- with this group. The market closed
quite active, but irregular. Growing consid
eration Is given to the question of money sup
plies between now and the time of â¢ the April
quarterly settlements. The continued firmness
of the London money market and the large
Government loan operations ' looming ' In the
near future there and on the Continent are
alro subjects for consideration.
The active speculative issues In the bond
market were inclined to be - heavy, but the
general list was Irregular. Total eales, par
value, $2,450,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call. r. : -

The awful discovery was made;.by.;tbe

Has-tily arising,^ she sought the source of
the : trouble, ' and,*; coming downstairs,'
found ' the little"" back bedroom,.' usually
occupied by the boy, full 'of ; the deadly
fluid. Gus was lying:in.bed as if "asleep.

covery of the tragedy, was made.
John Gorman was equally uncommuni

Inquest until the attendance of Charles

marked that "while all the witnesses had
testified clearly as to the fight in the sa

dumb and blind when they reached' the
sidewalk. Â¦
Charles Libby, the first witness, swore
that Eugene McCarthy and John Cahill
got into a fight In Nolan's saloon, and
when the crowd adjourned to the side
walk Libby walked . across the street. and
watched the crowd. Although he knew
every man but one, he was unable to give
the name or establish 'the identity 'of -a

â¢was watching from the other side of the
street a' car came alongr -and' he ' heard
something said about somebody being run
over. . v ' . -
The Inquest on the body of Eugene -Mc-
Carthy was resumed yesterday by Cor
oner Leland, two of the missing wit
nesses, Charles Libby and John Gorman,
having presented themselves, the third,
Charles Gilroy, being still absent. Cor
oner Leland asked Detective Crockett
whether he had made any attempt to find
Gilroy, and Crockett replied that he had
not been able to find any one who knew
of Gilroy's whereabouts. Whereupon the
Coroner called Daniel McCarthy, brother
of the deceased, and asked him if he
knew where Gilroy could be found. Mc-
Carthy answered that the name of. the
absent witness was Charles Gllroy and
that he was employed at the glass works,
corner of Fifteenth and Harrison streets.
Crockett explained that Daniel McCarthy
had told him last Sunday night that he
did not know Gilroy's address. ' ,
Eugene McCarthy was knocked down by
one of a crowd of men at the intersection
of Ninth and Folsom streets at half
past 8 o'clock last Sunday night, and fell
in front of a streetcar, which passed over
his body, killing him instantly. Every one
of the crowd except Gilroy was examined
at the inquest and not one of them would
swear that he saw the blow that sent Eu
gene McCarthy to his death.
United States Secret Service Agent
Hazen arrived from Los Angeles yester
day morning after having n'pped in the
bud a bold conspiracy to flood the repub
lic of Mexico with counterfeit five-peso
notes. The chief spirit In the conspiracy
was "Walter T. Canterbury, a journeyman
printer, and the plot was exposed
through the honesty of the lithographing
Jirm of Louis Roesch on Saneome street,
in this city.
,Â« On November 2S of last year the firm
* received a letter- from Canterbury, at
Chat tlsie in Jerome, Ariz., inclosing a
f*5 Mexican bill an.i asking for an esti
, iiiate on the price of engraving and print
.. ing copies of the same in iots of 1000
each. The writer suggested that paper
of the same kind and quality as th3t on
Â¦uhich the note was printed could b.: ob
tained from Crane Co., at Dalton. Mass,
llr. Roesch reported the matter to Mr.
-Hazeii, who. after consultation -with
United States District ~ Attorney Valen
tine of Los Angreles and Assistant United
States Attorney B. L. McKinley, dictated
a reply to be forwarded to Canterbury
in which he was asked as to whether he
vanted an exact copy of the biil. A re
ply was received from Canterbury that
he wanted the note copied- exactly to the
hair line. After he had obtained all the
information necessary as to . the inten
tions of Canterbury Mr. Hazen went to
Los Acgeles and found his man at Tvork
in a printing-office there. Canterbury
fajd at first that he wanted the notes to
use as advertising labels, and that he
nad no partners, but that if the notes
were printed he could get all the money
he needed to pay for the engraving and
printing of them. All that Hazen could
lmd on his person was 25 cents. As noth
ing had been effected and no cha r ge
fpuld be made to hold Canterbury he was
released after his photograph and de
*criptlon had been taken. The notes, if
well counterfeited, would pass for two
dollars and a half in gold coin.
