make the ground tremble. It seemed
to the weary travelers as if the moun

add to the horror , of the situation the
travelers encountered every now and
then a fer-de-lance, the deadliest of all
snakes. Scattered specimens of these
serpents, of which thousands have been
killed by the eruptions, were seen amid
the glare from the volcano, and the
flashes of lightning gliding over the
rocks and hurrying away/ as if they,
too, , had learned that their mountain

sentiment for him was demonstrated in
an unprecedented degree. His â¢ friends

will choose the successor to Hanna in the

been "reconciled." The drift of senti

more enthusiastic for the Senator, and

gave no warning, of the devastation that
it was preparing to work. The volcano
was all but somnolent and the internal

continued, until half-past 8'0'cloctc last
night, when an explosion of terrible
force occurred. Â¦ Immediately hot jnud
began pouring into the sea from every
side of the mountain. Flamesshot sky

After the full committee on resolutions
had been In session until after 11 p. m. a
sub-committee consisting of Dick, Hard
ing and Tayler was appointed to revise
the draft of a platform that General Dick
had J . submitted and that had been con
sidered by sections. Â¦ Tbe principal change
was in the plank of reciprocity. A reso
lution offered by; Albert A. Douglas, after
minor changes, was substituted for the
plank that General Dick had drafted on
that matter. The only contest in the com
mittee was on this plank, which is an en
dorsement of the policy of President
Roosevelt and bf the" Ohio Republican
Congressmen with the exception of. Dick.
In this; contest Senator' Hanna has not
co-operated . with Congressman Dick.
The platform of the latter, was" adopted
with this single exception by the commit
tee and as modified it probably will be
adopted by the convention.
The committee on resolutions organized
with Congressman Dick as chairman.
After the usual exchange of opinions the
committee took a recess for dinner till 8
o'clock. It was announced tHat Chairman
Dick had drafted a platform and that It
had been decided that it would be consid
ered first section by section in the full
committee and that if it was adopted
without material changes there would be
no occasion for a sub-committee.
After the completion pi other routine
business there were calls' for Senator
Hanna until he was compelled to respond,
but he refused to discuss public questions
ln^ advance of the address of the perma
nent chairman. This declination in cour
tesy to General Grosvenor was accepted,
and after a demonstration in honor of
Senator Hanna the convention adjourned,
after being in session only an hour, until
10 a. m. to-morrow. The committees went
into session at once.
CALLS FOR HANNA.
The twenty-one Congressional districts
were called at the conclusion of Governor
Nash's speech and the selections made at
the district meetings were announced for
members of the new State Committee,
vice presidents and assistant secretaries
and also the members of the committees
on credentials, permanent organization

The armory which has 8000 chairs, was
well filled when 'Hon. P. W. Durr, y of
Cincinnati, chairman; of the State Central
Committee,, called the convention to or
der this afternoon. The leaders, notably
Hanna, Governor Nash, General Grosve
nor and many prominent politicians, were
cheered as they entered.
Chjalrman Durr reviewed the history, of
the last State campaign and congratulat
ed the;party on' the outlook for'thlsyear.
Governor George K. Nash was then an
nounced as temporary chairman. ,'He
was tendered an ovation on being.'in
troduced. He spoke at ' length j of the ac
tion of the State Legislature in regard to
taxation and corporations, saying: .
! "The corporations should not be looked
. One. of the most important conferences
was held Â¦ between Senator Hanna and
George B. Cox, of Cincinnati, and con
tinued so long this morning that quite
a crowd was kept in waiting outside '.of
Senator Hanna's office.
OPENS CONVENTION.
With the platform completed to-nlgat
and only three nominations for minor
places to be made, it -Is thought that the
convention will conclude early to-morrow,
although General Grosvenor will speak at
length, and the time of Senator Hanna's
speech. is something of which he .himself
is unable to give any information.
At the meeting of the committee on res
olutions to-night It was reported that
most of the opposition to Chairman
Dick's draft of. a platform came from
Harding, Daugherty, Douglass and Tay
ler. They wanted the plank on Cuban
reciprocity to . Indorse President Roose
velt's policy specifically rather than . in
terms of a general indorsement of the na
tional administration.
At. the .meeting, of the delegates from
the Eighteenth District R. W. Tayler de
clined the nomination for re-election - as
Congressman on account of recent en
gagements as an attorney, but his friends
were prompt in stating that this did not
put him out. of the race for the Gov
ernorship.
â¢ IN BACE FOB, GOVERNOR.
While, the interests of Senator Hanna
v.-ere paramount i In the selection of all
the committees, all the others, were recog
nized in the selection of the committee on
resolutions. Seven Congressmenâ Dick,
Gill, Hildebrandt," Nevin. Skiles, Tayler
and . Kyleâ were â¢ selected on this commit
tee, and three members of the Legisla
ture, . Harding, Patterson - and Cole. The
dress parade at this convention of candi
dates for 'the Republican gubernatorial
nomination continued into the district
meetings, which favored their respective
favorites by placing Dick, Daugherty,
Douglas, Harding and Tayler on the com
mittee on resolutions.
A statement, issued . by a news agency
this morning says that Lord Kitchener
will 'become adjutant general of the
forces Instead of. taking command of the
Indian army, as previously reported.
A. J. Balfour, the Government lender,
made no statement In the House of Com
mons to-day : regarding the peace agree
ment, but he announced a postponement
of the budget discussion, fixed for. this
week, remarking that. It would be very
inconvenient to ! debate the budget while
there were other things in the. balance.
He explained that it w*ould be impossible
in' discussing the budget to prevent refer
ences to the peace negotiations.

discussed, but these are expected to be
fully disposed of within a day or two.
Meanwhile the .basis v f or. this almost

Pattersons speech it was developed that
four speeches jet remain to be delivered
In the general debateâ by Spooner, Bacon
Clay and Carmack. Dubois suggested
that the minority, so far as he knew
would gladly vote next Tuesday This
statement led to a discussion as to hold:
jngr a session of the Senate on Memorial
During the discussion a proposition was
made- that a time be fixed on alternate
Tuesdays, beginning next week, for a
vote On the Philippine bill, the Nicaragua
canal bill and the Cuban reciprocity bill
and that a final adjournment be agreed
on for the fourth Tuesday, but it was too
startling to be taken seriously, although
some Senators regarded it favorably
For several hours to-day Patterson of
Colorado discussed the Philippine ques
tion, concluding the speech which he be
gan yesterday. After reviewing and com
menting on the general Philippines ques
tion, he attacked the pending bill, par
ticularly its provisions regarding the
holding of lands. He declared that it was
monstrous and never should be enacted
into law. He urged that the Filipinos be
granted their independence and drew an
eloquent word picture pf the turning over

Senator Culberson here entered on the
line of questions to bring out the details
or the witness* information concerning
the administration of the water cure
McDonald said that except on one oc
casion he never had been a witness to the
process and that this occasion was th*
one in which the presidente of Igbaras
was subjected to this treatment. .He said
that at the time Captain, now Major
Olenn, judge advocate of General Hughes'*
department, was in command and that he
S?â¢* 004 the P r X soner had been given
the water cure on Captain Glenn's order.
Rawlins sharply resented 'this -remark
and said If he could not be 'protected: in
the committee he would remain away.
Chairman Lodge stated that Senator Diet
rich's remark was not in order and- the
latter responded that he did not Intend to
call highminded Senators designing pol
iticians. : '.
Captain McDonald was questioned con?
cerntnff the taking of prisoners and. also
the buraint of some towns. He said he
gave orders to burn several towns whicli
were in hostile country and sheltered
ladrones.. and insurgents. Captain Mc-
Donald stated that he intended 'to 'ask
that O'Brien be prosecuted by the Federal
authorities for perjury. Senator Lodge,
chairman of the committee, said there
was no doubt that steps would be taken
looking to the man's 'prosecution. "="
Captain McDonald's testimony- in' the
main consisted of the presentation of of
ficial documents procured from the War
Department for the purpose of refuting
statements made by O'Brien derogatory to
the. character of McDonald. The first "of
these was a record showing that O'Brien
had been on duty at San Joaquin from
July 12, 1900, to February 26, 1901, whereas
he had testified that he was present- at
Igbaras, thirty miles away, when that
town was burned, November 2, liKKJ. . This
was the occasion upon which, according
to O'Brien's testimony a Spanish woman
was maltreated by American officers and
enlisted men. The witness also presented
a. complete set of accounts of Company
M to show that he was not a "thief ''as'
O'Brien had charged he was.
The witness related the details of the
execution at the town of Guimbal of the
Filipino bandit, Pedro Gardenefo, who
O'Brien had said, was mistreated by Cap
tain McDonald to the extent that he had
been subjected to a court-martial The
witness said that Gardenero had been
guilty of many heinous offenses against
the natives and, having been captured by
them, was about to be executed in the
public square when he was rescued by
American soldiers and turned over to him.
Subsequently he had placed Gardenero in
the hands of Captain Boardman who
turned him over to the civil authorities,
f^ 1^ Â¥ them he was executed. Captain
McDonald said he and Boardman had been
tried by court-martial for placing the man
In the hands of the civil authorities and
had been found guilty -of the act. Gen
eral Hughes, he said, however, disap
proved the findings as Inadequate savin*
that no punishment was preferable to that
prescribed.
WASHINGTON. May 27.â Captain Mc-
Donald continued his statement before the
Philippine Committee of the Senate and
presented official statements to refute the
testimony of Corporal O'Brien. Senator
Rawlins of Utah said the statements were
unnecessary to refute O'Brien. Senator
Dietrich retorted that if O'Brien's state
ment had been suppressed at the point
where the minority- wanted Uf enough
would, have leaked out^to^glve designing
politicians an opportunity* to' inake'use
of it.

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G' STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, May 27.â Secretary
of War Root, to-day met the attack that
Is how being made on the War Depart
ment by \ Democratic representatives ' for
extravagance in the expenditure of Cuban
funds under Brigadier-General -Wood and
Major-Qeneral Brooke, by frankly assum
ing the responsibility, therefore declaring
that' the expenditures were made legally
and with full authority.
"I thought we threshed all this out a
year and a half ago," said Hoot. "When
these charges were lirst made, we showed
that, every dollar expended in Cuba had
been accounted for."
It was said at the War Department
tc-day that it is true that General Wood,
as Military Governor of the Island of
Cuba, had received an allowance for the
purpose : of. entertainment, and other, ex
penses that were necessary because of
Ms position in the island. The position
required large expenditures for the pur
poses' of entertainment. - It was stated
that General Wood was quitting Cuba
poorer than when he went to the island,
and . that in consequence of the expenses
he had to meet he had encroached upon
o*her sources of Income. â¢
With reference to .payments made to
Gcmez, the Secretary of War thinks it
very doubtful whether the Democratic
Congressional Committee will go so far
as to attack the wisdom and propriety of
these payments. General Gomez, at the
eric of the war, which < he had led with
&>uch success pn behalf of the . Cubans,
was penniless, and without any means of
support, with many followers and re
tainers looking to him for help. He was
a man of great influence, whose advice
was:- valuable and one of the greatest
powers for tranquillity in the Island under
American rule. Such -money as was paid
to him, it is said, met with the approval
of the Cubans, and General Gomez, In
return, rendered valuable service in the
direction of preparing Cuba to take her
place among the nations.
Washington; . May 27.-Tne Housa
to-day passed the Shattuc Immigration
bill. The feature of the day was a lively
debate on the question of prohibiting the
sale of intoxicating liquors at immigrant
stations. It was precipitated by an
amendment offered by Bowersock, of
Kansas, to prohibit such sale, which wa3
carriedâ 83 to 13. . . .-.
Landls, of Indiana, followed this vic
tory with an amendment to prohibit tha
sale of intoxicants in the Capitol and It
prevailed by a still larger majorityâ 10S
to 19.
The bill brings together into one act all
the scattered legislation heretofore en
acted in regard to the immigration of
aliens into the United States, arranges
it in sequence, etc., eliminates what has>
become obsolete by. reason of subsequent
legislation; amends some of the adminis
trative features, and also adds some pro
visions to the general laws and others
made necessary by the extension of the
territorial limits of the United States- .
Among the more important changes are
these increasing the head-tax on aliens
coming Into the United States by land
transportation from $1 to $150; adding to
the excluded.' classes epileptics. < persons
who have been Insane within five years,
anarchists or persons who advocate the
overthrow of government by force; pros
titutes and procurers, (whose- importa-'
t!on is now a felony, but whose entry Ja
not prohibited); broadening the word
"contract" in the contract labor law to
include "offer, solicitation or promise:"
providing for the fine of steamship com
panies which receive at the port of de
parture aliens afflicted with loathsome
or contagious disease, instead of provld-*
Ing. as now, for their deportation on ar
rival here; extending the time within
which an alien who becomes- a public
charge may be deported from, one to two
years, and providing that immigrants
over fifteen years old should be able to>
read in some language.
Just before the session closed a special
rule was presented to make the bill, for
coinage of subsidiary silver a continuing
order until disposed of. A vote will bo
taken on the rule to-morrow.

fying charges against the National Elec
trical Supply Dealers' Association, and
requesting that he direct the Attorney-
General of the United States to seek evi
dence in Chicago to prosecute the officers

illegal trust.
:The men who signed the statement sent
the President an offer to furnish evidence
in support of their charges and, if court
proceedings are authorized, to appear as
witnesses for the Government. The com
munication charges that officers of the
Association have conspired with the Na

ciation and among themselves to drive
out of business, exterminate and crush
all independent electrical supply manufac
turers and dealers. - Such a conspiracy, it
is declared, has been in. existence for the
last two years and its purpose has been
to create an electrical supply trust con
trary to the statutes of the United States.
The officers and members of -the supply
trust, it is charged have blacklisted, boy
cotted and illegally attacked independent
supply- dealers; they have Imposed fines
on - members for selling â¢ to independent
dealers;. they have employed spotters and
spies to destroy trade- rivals; they have
increased the cost of electrical supplies to
the public 65 to 100 percent and far be
yond what the actual value of such sup
plies justify; have employed arbitrators
and supervisors .and' have raised and low

Tragedy.
Suicide of a Would-BÂ©
Robinson was about seven years older
than his half sister. He grieved' a great
deal over her downfall. Some months ago
Guy Schrader committed suicide in a
lecal lodging-house because. It is said,
of his infatuation for the girl.
Four months ago the young woman left
here, and the tragedy which some had
thought might be enacted here occurred
in Los Angeles. â¢
SAN DIEGO, May 27.â Madeline Grind

her half brother, William Robinson, who
committed suicide after fatally wound
ing her, were well-known here. Robin
son had for years tried to turn his
sister from the life she insisted on fol
lowing, and while she was~here he was
heard to assert an Intention to kill her
and himself if she did not change her
course. The mother of .the two was
married a third time to a Mr. Solomon
sen, and together they tried to correct
â¢Madeline's waywardness. When the
mother died the girl was about to be
sent to the reform school, when she was
adopted by a San "Diego woman, with
the consent of her stepfather. Within
a week after she became eighteen 'years
old ehe left her new home. Â«
When taken Into the station, Miss
Grinder, although drenched with blood
from her wounds, did not lose conscious
ness. She talked rationally with the
officers, describing the scene accurately
and giving Information regarding herself.
She is still alive. /
Robinson and Miss Grinder came to
Los Angeles from San. Diego.
Robinson then turned the revolver on
himself, sending a bullet into his right
temple. The police were .summoned and
the victims of the shooting were hurried
to the station.
LOS ANGELES, May 27.â William Rob
inson shot and fatally wounded Madeline
Grinder, alias Ray Page, his half-sister,
and then fired a bullet into his own brain,
dying shortly afterward. The' crime was
committed late this afternoon on North
Alameda street, in front of the premises
at No.' 434, where the young woman was
staying. ' She was absent from the house
when Robinson called to see her. He had
made previous demands upon his half
sister to live with him, but she had per
sistently refused. The landlady went out
to look for Miss Grinder, to inform, her
that her brother was searching for her.
She found the young woman 'and had
started back with her when they heard
Robinson approaching from behind. Both
women ran. Robinson pursued, and, as
he neared his half-sister, he drew a- re
volver and flred two shots at the fleeing
girl. Miss Grinder grasped a- post to
support herself and Robinson, rushing up,
seized her by the hair and flred another
shot at close range. The young woman
threw up her hand, the bullet passing
through a finger and entering the skull
just back of the right ear.

Granelli had planned the placing: of the
bar in the culvert to wreck the first train
which came along.
The two were quietly incarcerated in
Jail. Their trials were hurried, both were
found gnilty and now the full facts are
out. Arnold was given a light punish

SAX JOSE. May 27.â James Robinson,
the young negro who made a brutal as
sault on Mary Gabel on May 4, pleaded
guilty to-day when arraigned before Judge
Lorigan. Robinson beat Miss Gabel into
insensibility with a club and carried her
into a yard on North First street, near
the railroad track. Then he became
frightened, and when she regained "con
sciousness he assisted her to her feet and
helped convey her to the receiving hos
pital. At that time he claimed he had
b^en passing by and was attracted by the
girl's groans. Later he confessed when
the girl identified him as her assailant.
For a number of days Miss Gabel's life
was despaired of.
Robinson will be sentenced on Friday;
when he probably will receive a life term
or its equivalent. The negro is an ex
convict, having served a term m prison
for a burglary committed in San Diegtj.
The extreme penalty for the crime of
which he has pleaded guilty is death.
YOUNG CUXPBJT CONFESSES.
Calame removed the bar, tapped the
telegraph wire and notified the main office
at Portland. As a result every station
along the line to Portland was quickly
warned of the presence of wreckers and
trainmen preceded the special over each
division. The train got through without
accident and the occupants knew little or
nothing of the danger which, had threat
ened them. But for the trackwalker's
discovery many of them must have been
killed. â¢ -
At a point of the curve, which could
not be seen until one is within a few
yards of it, the trackwalker saw a steel
bar rising from a culvert and crossing the
rail. A hurried examination showed the
bar to be cleverly held in place, so that
no engine wheels couki keep to the rails
after striking' it- It was cleajr a.t a glance
that an awful wreck had been planned.
He found nothing unusual until he
reached a curve around RicÂ© Hill, known
as Grecian Bend.
President Harriman's train crossed the
Oregon line early on Sunday morning.

REDDING, May 27.â According to in
formation received from apparently re
liable sources in Redding to-day, the spe
cial train bearing President E. H. Harri
xnan of the Southern Pacific Company
and his family. Julius Kruttschnitt and
other railroad officials, . which went
through to Portland ten days ago, came
within an ace of being wrecked some
miles south of Roseburg, in Southern
Oregon. In fact, the disaster was averted
only by a timely_discovery by a track
walker two hours before the special was
due. An angle bar had been eo placed at
& culvert as to wreck the train as It
rounded a curve. The particulars of the
affair were hushed up and gained pub
licity only with the sentencing- of Harry
Granelli, a youth not quite of age, to the
Oregon Penitentiary for three years for
obstructing: the railroad track and the
sending ot his 17-year-old accomplice,
Thomas Arnold, to the County Jail for
malicious mischief.

I There was apparently no reason for the
/crime and the. one theory advanced- is
that of insanity. Neighbors of Prior say
that his mind has been weak for some
time, but he never appeared violent. He
made no attempt to harm the . childron
who were in the room when he shot -his
wife. The wounded woman has not been
able to make a statement.
I Prior was 45 years of age. Up to a short
.time" ago he was manager of the Lemoore
Creamery. Coroner Thomas has left
this city for the scene of the crime to
hold an inquest. . â¢
The reports ol the rifle and . screams of
-the children aroused the neighbors .and
they rushed into the house. Prior lay
<iead in the center of the room and near
by-lay hjs wife, still alive. Physicians
were hurriedly summoned, and, after an
examination, pronounced her wounds
fatal, -v ' :
r HANFORD, May 27.â Lemoore was the
scene of an awful double tragedy at 5
o'clock- this afternoon, when A. E.
Prior, an old resident of that city,, fatal
ly wounded his wife and< then killed him
self. The affair took place In the Prior
home. In the room at the time were the
two small bhildren of the couple.
/ Prior entered the house with a 22-call

a quarrel with his wife. Suddenly ho
raised his rifle and fired at her. The bul
let'struck her in the small of the back
and passed through her body. Seeing that
he had not killed he J-, Prior fired again,
the second- bullet striking the woman in
the hand. * Apparently being satisfied
that he had killed his wife, Prior placed
the muzzle of ; the rifle against 1m own

Kuwana was sent to Japan two years
ago from Stanford University to make a
study of the coccidae of Japan, with spe-
"My work," he says, "will be scientific
and economic study ! and the teaching of
the fauna of that country. I shall en
deavor to keep in communication with all
parts of the world, to publish from time
to time the results of my investigations
and to export specimens. The coccidae or
scale insects, which are of great scientific
and economic importance, will receive
special attention. The well-known cot
tony cushion scale, which almost ruined
the orange culture of Southern California
some twenty years ago, and the San Jose
scale, which is also a well-known pest to
the fruit growers of this country, are in
this group."
To gather material for his thesis Ku
wana is going to the, island of Klushlu,
Japan, where at Hikosau he proposes to
establish an entomological laboratory, the
first of Its kind In Kiushiu.
In order to make good his claim to -the
distinction of a Ph. D. he must demon
strate his worthiness in an original thesis
worked out along the lines of the study
he claims to have made his own. Kuwa
na's specialty is entomology, and the par
ticular branch to which he has most_
earnestly devoted himself is the coccidae,"
or scale insects.
The completeness of Kuwana's Ameri
canization can be estimated by the plans
he has laid for capturing his Ph. D. By
dint of hard work he has managed to ac
quire in a strange land from books writ
ten in and teachers talking a foreign
tongue recognition of hia,^scholarship,
suÂ£k. as satisfies the average ambitious
American student.
Kuwana's ambition goes further, how
ever. . â

upon which he depends to earn for hini
the degree of doctor of philisophy. Ku
wana is a Japanese. "He is a graduate of
Cornell and Stanford universities, is a

ers by the force of the explosion.- It is
known that some of the bodies are burled
beneath from fifty to seventy torfs of
debris, and while some of these 'may be.
recovered it is very probable that many
will never be seen again.
( The company claims that it is not in
possession of a full list of all the men
who met death. It is said that the names
of the contract men are unknown. No
record appears , to have been kept, and
therefore the * exact number of lives lost
may never be known. - ; - . . .
The committee on disbursements . is
making excellent use of the relief, fund,
which now amounts to $15,000. So far It
has been found that fifty widows and ap
proximately 10Q children stand . in need of
assistance. In many Instances whole fam
ilies have been rendered destitute by the
death of the breadwinners.

work which is done by the pupils at the
academy.' Specimens of the pupils? work
in oil painting, decorating chinaware, em
broidery and pyrography were on exhibi
tion in the parlor of the hall. The work
displayed how well the young ladies have
been trained and' also Â¦ reflected great
credit on their teachers.' Especially
noticeable In the display .was : the, . china
ware which ! had been decorated :by May

whose work was exhibited were Genevieve

friends of the students were given an op-
In presenting the medals, certificates
and diplomas Very Rev. Father Pius Mur
phy took occasion to pay a high tribute
to the efficient work of the Dominican
Sisters, than whom, he declared, there
were no more capable instructors in the
State. He explained the position of .the
Catholic ' Church In regard to the educa
tion of the child. He said that God had
intrusted the parent with the care of his
children and that the parent's duty was so
sacred that there Was no power on earth
that gave a, right to usurp it. He said
that parents are answerable to God for
their trust and that they cannot' when
called to account for their conduct toward
their offspring answer as did Cain, "I
am not my brother's keeper."
He said that which belongs to Caesar
should be given to Caesar, but that as
the soul of the child belonged to God, who
had Impressed it with his Image, it should
be given to God.
In conclusion. Father Murphy addressed
a few words to the young ladies, who were
about to embark on their life Journey. > He
also thanked "the people, in behalf of i the
Dominican Sisters, , for the splendid at
tendance at the exercises. . , . r â¢ â¢
CHILD BELONGS TO GOD.
The programme was > begun' in a very
pleasant manner by the singing of Mor
ltz â¢â¢ Peuschel'a "Rose Wa^ltz" by thirty
eight young ladies, all dressed in whiter
They had been carefully trained by the
Bisters and sang the difficult music with
out a single false note and with fine,
clear voices. The Juvenile chorus, con
sisting of little girls, none of whom is
more than 10 years of age. sang "Mighty
Lak a Rose" In 'the most commendable
manner. The singing of the sweet voiced
little ones proved very delightful to the
audience and they were heartily ap
plauded. l
* The feature of the exercises and the
most picturesque event on the programme
was the story of the "Crosses" as told
In song by a. large chorus of girls. , This
etory was intended to illustrate that each
man Is best fitted. to bear the cares and
troubles, or metaphorically, the cross
which God has ordained he. should carry.
.The costumes of the young ladies who
appeared in this i spectacular scene were
most: elaborate. >
SINGING IS APPRECIATED.
There were but two graduates. Miss
Julia Murphy and Miss Charlotte Jepsen.
Miss Murphy, who had the honor of be
in 3 the valedictorian, can. also boaat of
the honor of" having received her entire
education fromÂ«the Dominican Sisters, as
she has been a pupil, in j St. .Rose Acad
emy since her sixth year. Miss Charlotte
Jepsen delivered an address on "Califor
nia," in -which she described the pictur
esque scenery and bountiful resources
with which nature has blessed the Golden
State. Both of the graduates had prov
ed themselves excellent â¢ scholars. Miss
Murphy won a gold medal for proficiency
â¢in higher English, while Miss Jepsen was
presented with a gold medal for excel
lence in classic literature. ,
THE commencement exercises . of
St. Rose Academy were held yes
terday in Golden Gate Hall before
a large gathering of the friends
of the fair young students and of
their teachers, the Dominican Sisters.
The programme, which consisted of an
able address from one of the graduates
and of songs sweetly rendered by cho
ruses of the younger pupils, was admir
ably calculated to show how successful
have been the Sisters in training the
girls who attend their school to be grace
ful, modest and cultured young women.

Id now only a matter of form.. She left the
Union Iron Works at 10 o'clock and returned
shortly after 1 P. m., having been kept at full
speed during the whole time. She came up to

a much more satisfactory boat than the Perry,
which was recently accepted. When the Perry

escort to President Loubet, arrived here
to-day. M. Loubet landed at noon. He
was welcomed by the Mayor and received
an ovation from the populace. . The Presi
dent proceeded ,to the Chamber of Com
merce, and at a luncheon subsequently
he expressed his delight at the extreme
cordiality of the welcome extended to him
by both the Imperial famiiy and the peo
ple of Russia.
The strengthening of. the bonds uniting
Russia and France would, he believed,
have the beneficial effect of causing
Frenchmen to forget their own differ
ences, which were more apparent than
real, and to turn their united attention to
financial, economic and social problems
urgently requiring settlement.
President Loubet concluded with drink
ing a toast "To the Reunion of All
Frenchmen." Â¦ '

proceeded to Paris. Â¦>

benefit received from the use of
Dr. Miles' Nervine prompted
her to make this statement:
"It affords me great pleasure to add
mjr testimony to the very excellent
merits of Dr. Miles' Nervine. Although
I am past So years of age I find it
soothes the tired brain, quiets the irri- -
lated nerves and insures restful sleep.
I never feel contented without a bottle j
of it in the house." Gratefully yours,

An educational test sets a standard by which'' we
can exclude the horde of immigrants coming from
regions where the people are so illiterate they are un
fit to become American citizens, while it leaves the
way free for people from the great enlightened races
where schools are common: and the mass of people
Setting aside all the extravagances of statement,
the argument remains weak; and futile. It is well,
known that many, educated men are rascals, but that
fact does not prevent an educational test from being
one of the best possible protections against undesir
able' immigration. Other tests 0/ course should be
united withjt,- but it fills a place in the exclusion
programme that no other restriction can do so well.'
That any one of the anarchist assassins or that
most anarchists could take chairs in "our universities
is of course too absurd a statement to.be worth re
futing. General Grosvenor- is a man .of light and
leading in the nation and has a reputation to' lose,
which he will surely do if/he make many more such
assertions as that. It is to be noted only as an evidence
that when an orator gets excited on the floor of the
House he will say anything.
One of the leading opponents of 1 the test was Gen
eral Grosvenor, who argued that it .would not ex
clude anarchists. He is quoted in the dispatches as
having said that Luccheni, who 'assassinated the Em
press of Austria, spoke three languages; that Bressi,
who killed King Humbert, was educated;, that the
assassin of President McKinley was an American
and the product of. American schools; that Guiteau
and Booth were men of education. "They, could all
have coine in under the educational test," said Gen
eral , Grosvenor. . "Most of them could have taken
chairs as professors in our universities. You would
keep out the honest but ignorant man, ; but you would
let in the educated criminals xvhp ', come to plot
against the institutions of our country." '.' .
DURING the debate in the House on the pro
posal to insert an educational test in the im
migration restriction bill a good deal of
opposition to the plan was developed: The argu
ments -of the opposition were to the effect that a
great many good people cannot write nor read,
while a great many bad people can do both, and con
sequently it would be an act of injustice and of folly
en the part of the- United States to demand that all
intending immigrants shall be able to read their own
language. . .

Notwithstanding the improbability, of any notice
being taken of the point raised by the diplomatic ex
perts, it is said the act of the President is unques
tionably one of. great significance. It demonstrates
beyond a doubt the supremacy of the United States
in this hemisphere and the interest taken .by our Gov
ernment and our people in air that, concerns the peo
ple of any part of' the hemisphere; One diplomat is
quoted as saying that if we can of our, own motion
without the consent of a foreign" Government send
relief to an island controlled by that Government
when the people are afflicted by a calamity of nature,
we could also' send relief should the 'people be op
pressed'by the Government itself, 'as we did in Cuba.'
That seems like a far-fetched argument, but there
may be reason in it. At any rate it sounds a good
deal like the Monroe doctrine of the future.
REPORTS from - Washington are .to the
effect .that, "some of the diplomatists at'
the capital are engaged in' discussing tlie'
international aspects - of the relief supplies for
warded by. the United , States Government to
Martinique and St. Vincent. It is ' stated that
immediately upon getting authentic information con
cerning the calamity, the President ordered relief to
be dispatched to the two islands without waiting to
communicate his intentions to either the British or
the French Government. In short, the President is
said to have acted as if.it were an American issue
strictly, giving- no attention whatever to the fdreign
elements in the case. .
The discussion of course is purely academic. It. is
not at all likely that either Great Britain or France
will make any protest against the action of the Pres
ident. On the contrary, each of .them will most cor
dially thank him 'for it. An invasion that' carries
prompt help to a stricken people is not subject to' the
ordinary rules of diplomacy. It is greeted with grati
tude by those to whom it brings relief and with ad
miration by the humane in every part of the world.

When it is recalled that the three men constituting
a majority of the commission are to have not. only
this high power over the public and the corpora
tions but are also to have unlimited power to make
appointments of clerks and employes in every county
and every municipality of the State, it will be seen
that if such a commission is to be established at all
it should be composed of the worthiest men of the
State. And yet the scheme of Gage and the bosses is
to put all that power into the hands of men who will
almost certainly be chosen' from the ranks of the job
hunters and tax shirkers who make up the following
and the support of the political machine of the
Southern Pacific Raihoad. -
A significant sentence of the amendment declares-.
"The commission shall, from and after said appoint
ment of members, have exclusive jurisdiction and
power." That means that, three men will have a
power over the great corporations and their rela
tions to the public which can be curtailed neither by
the courts nor by the Legislature.
It will be perceived that the amendment makes the
commission a sort of mountebank board having
authority to wander up and down the State holding
a session wherever it chooses. No citizen fortunate
enough to have money invested in the stock of any
corporation over which the commission has jurisdic
tion is eligible to become a member of it. On the
other hand, there is nothing to prevent some giant
corporation procuring the appointment of three of its
henchmen to the commission for the long terms of
six, eight and ten years, thus obtaining unlimited
power to discriminate against all rivals and even
tually get control of all -public" utilities.
It is to be borne in mind that the commission is to
supervise and regulate railroads,- transportation com
panies, common carriers, banks, insurance compa
nies, water, gas, electric light and power companies,
telephone, telegraph, sleeping car and express com
panies. The exclusion clause therefore debars from
the office any person who is in any way either di
rectly or indirectly interested in any one of those cor
porations. From what class of men would Gage be
likely to draw his appointees to the commission un
der that clause, should the amendment be carried?
commission provided by the scheme. The restric
tions constitute something approaching the virtual
exclusion .of almost every property-owner in the
State from a seat on the commission. They reveal
an evident intention on the part of the schemers to
make the office attainable only to political job
hunters or to men who are willing to perjure them
selves for the sake of holding it.
The clause in question says: "The commission
shall be deemed in continuous session, but may. sit
at any place or places in the State and at any time
as it may determine necessary in the conduct of its
business. The Commissioners shall be qualified
electors of the State and of the district from which
they are elected or appointed, and shall not be inter
ested directly or indirectly as stockholder, or cred
itor, agent, attorney, or employe, or otherwise in
any of the corporations, companies, or business over
which they have chaige, as herein provided; and
the act of the majority of the Commissioners shall
be deemed to be and shall be the act of the commis
sion."
ONE of the salient features of the scheme of
the corporation bosses embodied in Assem
bly amendment No. 28 is the restriction put
upon the eligibility of citizens to hold office in the
A MOUNTEBANK COMMISSION.
The matter will be discussed in Congress, and it
will be the first time in the world's history that
great parliament has debated such a question. We
may expect that the literature of volcanoes and the
great convulsions of nature will' be much enriched.
It will be an interesting result if all the. horror at
St. Pierre shall after all .save from destruction one of
the greatest works of man for the benefit of all the
world by inducing such location of the canal as shall
protect it. . " *
As to, the possibility of the Nicaraguan volcanoes
resuming, activity no prediction can be made.
Science stands silent in. the, presence of that awful
force which bursts through the crust of' the earth and
destroys all on its surface. Only when the eruption
begins can anything be known about it, except that
what. has happened once will happen again. But the
period is uncertain. Science knows about the stars,
but not about volcanic recurrence. The ephemeris of
a planet and the orbit and return of a comet are cal
culable, but not the outburst of a volcano. .
- The Nicaragua route is within reach' of volcanoes
that have shown pernicious activity in -historic times,
and a close study of the country, , the direction of
lava flow and the likely course of a shower of ashes
and stones will be required- before that route can be
decided to be absolutely safe or unsafe. .-This sort of
examination was not heretofore' regarded as neces
sary, because the attention of 'men had not been
called to this phase of the matter. If it shall appear
that the route is unsafe, and x that no such danger
lurks on the Panama ' route,' that alternative" will
greatly facilitate the completion of the work/ '
THE. wisdom of President McKinley in securing
an alternative proposition to the - Nicaragua
canal by tentative "negotiation of the Panama
route is being vindicated. The Martinique volcano
has exhibited the risk of putting this great and costly
work within reach, of. possible volcanic action.

To put an end to lynching and to bring that dis
graceful record to a close an appeal must be made to
the moral sense of the people. It is a fact of evil
portent that as our country grows this evil grows
with it. It is wonderfully increased by the presence
here of two unequal races, as no doubt the horrors
of war in the Philippines have been augmented by
two unequal races coming in contact there. But
whatever its cause the cure of lynching lies in a
higher moral sense and a more profound respect for
life and for law. . Â«
It is extremely doubtful if a Federal statute would
do any good, even if constitutional, which we ven
ture to doubt Lynching seems to be related to the
morbid . sequences of war. War is not Christian.
The clergy may preach that it is until doomsday
without changing the fact that every precept of
Christianity is violated in war. Settling great ques
tions by killing people becomes necessary because
Christianity is not made the general rule of indi
vidual and national life. A distinguished clergyman
of this State in a recent sermon vindicated the Chris
tianity of war by declaring that if it is right for a
policeman to arrest a man it is right for an army to
apply the larger force needed to overrun a whole
country. This is a strange perversion. The police
man is necessary only because the spirit of Chris
tianity has not become the rule of community life
and the law of social action. If all men were Chris
tian there would be no policemen, and if the nations
of Christendom were Christian nations there would
be no war and no armies. War being in the world
because the world is not Christian, it is perfectly nat
ural that morbid effects appear among the sequences
of war. The disregard of danger to self and the dis
regard of life, which are necessary in war, finally
work a ferment in the masses of a warlike state, and
there follow a disregard of law and a disrespect for
Kfe. |
Statutes. State or Federal, will not remedy the
matter. The cure must be moral. Instead of preach
ing war and glorifying bloodshed, let us preach peace
on earth and good will toward men. Let members of
Congress cease vindicating the infliction of human
misery, the murder of prisoners and children, in the
Philippines, by pointing to the burning of human
beings at home by mobs. Let there be less vaunting
of military prowess and averment of our own ability
to whip thÂ« world in war and more determination to
lead. the world in the arts of peace, in respect for law
and regard for human life. There are worthy things
in this world worth talking about besides armies and
navies, and vocations that require as much courage
as soldiering. We by no means detract from the sol-
'dieiybut we insist that he is necessary in the world
not because of Christianity but because- of", the lack
of it. - ' ,Â£3& â¢â¢:'- Â¦â¢-'-"^ ; .'.;. r ;;;t'-:-;.:
During the debate on the Philippine bill the official
record of military cruelty in the islands was met by a
statement of lynch enormities at home. There does
not seem to be wit enough .in Congress to make the
obvious answer. Those who defend the Herod order
of General Smith in Samar by citing the, burning of
negroes in the South seem to be unaware that they
are putting the array on a par with a mob. That
style of treatment will neither prove nor disprove
anything. Statistics show that about three hundred
lynchings a year, occur in this country.. Thousands
of men actively participate in them, and thousands
more sympathize with those guilty of them. Our

Many of -the sugar planters are anxious for
white laborers to come, to the Islands,; and
promise'' them a profit-sharing contract if they
will . remain a' certain space of time. The
proposition, to speak more fully, is that these
planters will give white laborers a house, gar
den and so many acres of land to cultivate
and they are to mutually share in the profits.
In reference to the claims of those who lost
their property by the burning of certain parts
of Honolulu at the time of the plague, the
matter is in the hands of a court of claims.
The total of claims will amount to about
?2. 000, 000. It is the wish of our people that
Congress- should lend us the money to pay
these claims. The United States was greatly
interested In seeing that the plague was
stamped out, and we think that they should
help us in the matter. All the people who
had their property burned need the money
badly and- the sooner the claims are settled the
better for 'all concerned.' We cannot pay the
claims, as all the (money we collect ' from tax
ation we* need for certain appropriations.
The labor situation In the Hawaiian Islands
Is very satisfactory. At. the time of annexa

thia account many of the laborers left the
plantations they were working on and roamed
around the islands hoping to better their con
ditions. This has all- been remedied and there
is now no lack of laborers.

"When the ordinance imposing a special
tax of IV* cents on each $100 assessed val
uation for schoolhouses was taken up
Brandenstein said that at least one cent
of the tax should be set aside for the re
pairs of schoolhouses. Wilson thought
such action would be detrimental to the
purpose of the ordinance, and It would not
be proper to designate repairs as an ex
treme emergency.
Roncovleri said that. It was the inten
tion of the board not' to' erect "costly
school buildings in the outlying districts
He thought tbat frame buildings would
suffice there. In the thickly settled por
tions permanent structures of brick would
be erected. D'Ancona suggested that be
fore final passage of the ordinance the
Board of Education , should submit a list
of the exact localities and the schools de
signed to be built..- No such designation
was made In the ordlnace, and Branden
steln said it should be amended so aa to
give the Board of Supervisors control
over the expenditure of the funds. -
Alpers thought the people<-sheuld be
heard on the subjefct. rConnor said that If
the special levy was raised for schools It
would endanger the proposed bond issue
for the same purpose.
"I move that this matter go over," said'
Connor, "and that in executive session wo
provide some means to give the School
Department, say, JlOO.OOO-to tide over the
emergency, and also to give more money
to the Police Department. Then we can
go ahead on the proposed bond Issue.
"The issue of high license is now before
this board, and If something Is not done*

should flx the license at $200 per year' Â« I
do not believe In raising the taxes, arid'I
voted with reluctance to levy the special
tax for a hospital. It is a bad precedent
to go above the dollar limit." . , ,?

LEV^T FOR NEW SCHOOLS.
"When the resolution declaring t"hat a
necessity exists for the levying of a. spe
cial tax of 7& cents for a hospital and
pledging the board to levy another tax of
IVi cents next year for the same purpose
was about to be voted upon Braunhart
objected on the ground that the second
tax might be an illegal proceeding in
not being. a temporary suspension of the
dollar limit as the charter requires. .
Comte said that taking a broadband lib
eral view of the matter he could see no
harm in. pledging- the board to . levy a
second tax . next year in order tliat the
hospital could be completed. *
"The charter framers never Intended
that this community should be deprived
of proper, accommodations for the sick
poor," said Comte. "This measure con
templates the expenditure of money for
a hospital and not for unnecessary teach
ers and janitors or extravagant salaries,
and should be adopted."
Braunhart quoted from a Supreme
Court decision that the board has author
ity to legislate for the building of a new
hospital and schoolhouses. Braunhart
said it would require a unanimous vote
of the eighteen members of the buard.
Sanderson took exception to this state
ment and held that if one Supervisor was
away on absence leave â¢ the measures
could be passed by seventeen votes, or
even by ten votes.
When Braunhart said that he would
surrender, his private convictions that the
ordinances for a special levy are inad
visable and vote for them because the
people demanded their passage, Branden
stein retorted that Braunhart's. position
was a false one.
"I say that Mr. Braunhart should not
vote with us if he thinks we are wrong,"
said Brandenstein. "We should all stand
or fall on these propositions and we want
no half-hearted allegiance from any
member of this board."
Supervisor Sanderson held that the bill
for a special levy was out of order under
the section of the charter ptovldlng that
when the public interest requires the
construction of a municipal building, the
cost of which will exceed the income of
the city for any one year, the Supervisors
must by ordinance passed by fourteen
members submit the proposition to in-'
cur a bonded indebtedness for the pur
pose. â¢ .
D'Ancona said that the hospital had
been declared unsanitary by the Board of
Health and the city was In the position
of having no proper hospital building.
Braunhart, In explaining his reluctance
to vote for the resolution, said that his
views were shared by several other mem
bers. Mayor Schmitz said that each Su
pervisor could speak -for himself.. /
"Mr. Braunhart's remark is an Impu
tation on this board," said Brandenstein
"and I call on any Supervisor to say now
if he intends to vote for a new hospital
against his convictions,"
. No Supervisor responded to the invi
tation. , .
Boxton objected to pledging 'himself to
vote for another special levy next year.
Curtis then, withdrew his resolution and
submitted instead his ordinance covering
the levy of 7^ cents for a new. hospital
for this year only. There was no objec
tion raised, even Sanderson, who all
along had spoken in opposition to the
special 1 levy, remaining silent. . The'or
dinance was passed to print. . - -^-'
OBJECTS TO SECONT> TAX.
Van Duzer reasoned that only when a
schoolhouse burned down -could the Board'
levy a special tax to build a new struc
ture and he did not think that any emer
gency existed at the present time for the
levying of a special tax.
W. A. Pease argued that a necessity
for new schools did exist. Chris Stader
said that he did not oppose the extra
levy but he -was afraid that the money
would not be expended wisely. Stader
said that it would not be advisable to
build a twelve-room school house in the
Suunyside district as the Board of Edu
cation intended, as a four-room school
nouse would be sufficient to accommodate
the 121 children In the locality.
"The city needs $3,000,000 for new
schools," said D'Ancona, "and we are not
cenfferned with the amount that each dis
trict is to receive. That Is an "after con
sideration. Let us first provide the funds
for the purpose and the segregation can
be made later." ' Â¦
iiraunharf asked Van Duzer if he did
not think that the Board of - Supervisors
was the sole judge of the urgent neces
sity of a' hospital and schooinouses and
Van Duzer replied that he did not think
so. - .
\ "Well I have here a Supreme Court de
cision'showing that the Board has such
power," said Braunhart.
â¢' TheBoard^ of Supervisors â¢ yesterday
passed to print two ordinances providing
for a special levy of-v7& cents on each
$100 of assessed valuation outside of the
dollar limit" for a*new hospital and an
other. 7% cents v for new. schoolhouses. The
meeting was called for 2 o'clock, but was
delayed exactly, one hour and a half . ow
ing to the absence of Supervisor Bran
den stein, who has a bad habit of coming
late. J Brandenstein's absence .was con
spicuous because It required a unanimous
vote to pass the two ordinances. Pre
vious, to the consideration of the meas
ures several citizens were heard on the
proposed . tax budget. .
M. Cushing of the /Point Lobos _ Im
provement Club said that his district had
four"' schoolhouses, two; of which are very
small. Cushing made an appeal for more
grammar, school f acuities, j for the erec
tion of a new nrehoBse, for. more lights
and better public protection in the dis
trict." - - : -. -Â¦Â¦â¢ -
A. P. Van Duzer referred to the char
ter, which provides that all necessary
municipal expenditures must be satisfied
out of the dollar limit of taxation and
that in case of necessity any extraordin
ary improvements must be made by I a
bond issue. Van Duzer asked the Board
not to be carried away by enthusiasm
and pass the measures for a special tax
which would undoubtedly be declared il
legal by the Supreme Court.
Lyons surrendered'hlmself to the police
shortly before midnight. In an Interview
he readily gave his side of the story. He
said Conway, who is a friend of his, carro
to him on March 22 and asked him to
oblige him by having an order on the
treasury cashed. - He said^ he looked at
the order and saw it was made out in his
name, and expressed ' surprise.' - To ac
commodate-his friend, however, he says
he cashed the order and turned the suni
over to: Conway. He thought* nothing
more of the matter until he. was Informed
ot the mistake yesterday . afternoon. He
stated that he would have come down
sooner, but was taken sick and confined
to his bed. -Lyons' name was. entered on
the "detinue book and he was placed in a
cell. He asked, to see the Chief, but the
latter declined to take a hand in the mat
ter, as the man was jailed at the request
of Judge Mogan. . , , ..
Conway vlilted the hall, shortly, after
ward and- informed the reporters that he
had receipts' for every dollar he had re
ceived. He had been drinking, and ' was
wroth at. the accusations made against
him. He declined, to give himself up, stat
ing that he would be\at his desk this
morning. . He then left for his home, at' 30
Lynch street. ! ' #
"If the clerk violated that rule it is for
him to explain. Every morning the clerk
presents to me about twenty-five treasury
orders. I sign them, presuming the clerk
has attended to his business." . >
JUDGE . MOGAN" EXPLAINS.
/""After the Dan Sullivan forgeries," said
/Judge Mogan, "I made a rule in my court
that the clerk should not' make out a
treasury order In favor of any person un
less the frame of that person was on the
bail receipt, and th&t the person so .pre
senting the bail receipt { should sign his
name and address in' the. receipt bqok be
fore the treasury order was turned over
to him. I ordered, however, that In case
of the inability of tbe person in whoso
name the bail receipt was- made to pre
sent It he could write on the back <5f the
receipt the following words: 'To the clerk
of the Police Court: Deliver my treasury
order to bearer, John Jones, signed John
Smith.' Then Jones .would present ,the
ball receipt to the clerk and would be re
quired to sign his name and' address In
the. receipt book. In that way the whole
history of the transaction Is had.
Conway was asked about the matter at
1 o'clock yesterday. He paled and threw
up his hands and hurried from -the Hall
of Justice excitedly remarking that there
was some i mistake and he would have to
examine his books. He and Lyons were
closeted together for many hours in a
neighboring saloon trying to fix the mat
ter 'up. Detective Seymour detailed all
his available men to locate the two men
and bring them In, but up to a late hoar
they could not be found. . -,
There was no signature opposite the last
entry, whereas in every other case on the
page, and there were more than a dozen,
the signature was there. Conway, . by
accident or design, made out the order, to
his friend R.~ E. Lyons and passed it up
among a half dozen others to Judge
Mogan on March 22 and the latter, relying
on his clerk, signed the paper.
In - all probability had Evans followed
the usual custom and come to Clerk Con
way, the latter would have given him the
money that was due hini and thus avoided
an exposure. Instead. Evans secured an
order from Judge Dunne and the crime
was revealed. It may be a coincidence,
but it is a fact that -Evans was the man
who exposed Dan Sullivan, the Police
Court clerk, who Is now serving a term
pt years in State Prison. . . /

and have him explain' the matter, but he
could not be . located. ' Judge Mo
gan and newspaper . representatives
returned to *he .Hall of Justice,
and after waiting until 6 o'clock
for Conway to appear, Captain Seymour
pried open his desk with a "jimmy" and
an Inspection of the court records dis
closed the following entry:

It appears that Evans on March 19 de
posited the sum of $250 cash bail for the
release- of Jessie Holland, a. woman who
was held^ by,' Judge Mogan on that' day
for grandtlarceny for stealing $20 from C.
H. Layman In a room on Turk-street on
March 15. She was tried last Monday be
fore Judge Dunne and a Jury and
was convicted. She was ordered
into/ custody. and Evans applied
for._and secured , an- order from
Judge Dunne for his money. Yesterday
morning he visited the City and County
.Treasurer's) office and was astounded
when told that the money had been paid v
to R, E. Lyons, a clerk under Bert Ma- V
hony, the County Clerk, two days after it
had been deposited. * . v Â¦Â¦
Evans went to Lyons and asked him if
he hadtlrawn the money and Lyons ad
mitted having done so for another party.
He declined to inform Evans who the
other party was and the latter "reported
the matter to the Chief . of Police. The
matter was turned over to Captain of De
tectives Seymour for investigation. Cap
tain Seymour immediately detailed Detec
tive Ross Whlttaker to Bring Lyons to
the Hall of Justice. Whittaker went to
the County Clerk's office and learned that
Lyons had received leave to absent him
self until. 3:30: p. m. Whlttaker waited
until the office closed, but Lyons failed
to materialize.
In the meantime a representative of the
Call informed Judge Mogan of the occur
rence. The latter was astounded. Visions
of another Sullivan forgery case. entered
his mind. Accompanied by ThÂ© Call's
representative, he visited the office of the
Treasurer and after an Inspection of the
following order, admitted that the signa
ture attached to it was his: .

Ninety* per cent of women suffer more or less

Dear Friends: Let me tell you something. I
have been a long time finding the way to health,
and now that 1 have found it, I would like to
tell you eo that you may find it also. For a
long time I was a sufferer from female trou-
bles In all their dreadful forms: had shooting
pains all over my body; headache, dizzy spells
and my back hurt most of the time. At time
of menstruation I suffered Intense pain. I tried
doctor after doctor and spent a great deal of
money. They told me I would never be a well
woman until I had an operation performed.
Some one induced me to try Kemp's Supposi-
tories and after using them for two months I
feel like a new woman. My friends all want
to know what makes me look so well. I hope
every one who suffers as I have done will give
Kemp's Suppositories a trial. They have help-
ed me, and several friends to whom I recom-
mended them have derived great benefit from
their use, 60 I know they will help. you.

II WONDERFUL
ESTABLISHMENT
Pattosien's Big Furniture
Store.
Common Honesty, Solid Sense
and Big Bargains. â¢
Manufacturing In large quantlies and
buying by the carload enable Pattosien's
to cut the prices so much lower than those
who must buy In limited quantities. The
confidence of the masses in Pattosien's
is the key that cpens the way to dispose
of these large quantities, and so the live
principle of trade, "the more you sell
ihe more you buy. and the more you buy
the cheaper you can sell." is exempli-
fied and maintained. The application of
this principle Is the power that has
placed Pattosien's in the front rank In
the Carpet and Furniture trade on the
Pacific Coast.
It is a pleasure to see the crowds of
sensible housekeepers hastening to se-
cure the honest bargains spread out be-
fore their eyes.
Some of the customers yesterday had
never visited the second floor of the big
Furniture Exposition Building, corner
Sixteenth and Mission streets, and they
looked in spellboun'd wonder at the scene
of beauty there displayed. Column upon
column could be written about the array
and assortment of Parlor Furniture on
the second floorâ all made in their owtf
workroomsâ the rich effects in upholstery,
the exclusive unique designs, the artistic
models and superior workmanship â goods
Â«hat can be found only in this up-to-date
establishment.
Pattosien's big Carpet department is
well worth a long visit to see (If nothing
else). During the great "MONEY RAIS-
ING SALE" you can buy finest Axmin-
eters at $110 ner yard, sewed and laid:
Tapestries, Brussels as low as 50c, and
elegant patterns at 75c, and all the new-
est and prettiest designs and patterns In
>latting from 10c per yard up toC 35c and

When the regiment first went into camp
it was believed that Company C of this
city would take the prize for efficiency.
The men were excellently drilled, and the
officers were considered among the most
painstaking in the regiment.- However,
when the day for awarding prizes came
it was announced that Company G of
Bakersfield had won on points. Fresno
was consoled by Colonel Johnson with
the information that "Company C was as
good as the best in the regiment and one
of the best in California. . .
The story goon leaked out that the prize
c oâ¢niittee claimed "that Lieutenant Scott
of Company C had taken his company out
on . a tour of the town on Sunday night
after church, and that all had behaved in
a. decidedly unsoldierly way. Immediate
ly there was a furor in camp. Accord-
Ing to Scott and his friends, the only
foundation for the story was that on the
Sunday night in question he had accom
panied Captain Bambauer of Merced and
a crowd of boys to church. Scott was to
return to Fresno, arid having a little time
to spare the crowd lined up in the street
and marched to three saloons, a drink be
ing taken at each. . - :
The boys deny that Scott was the leader
any more than other officers who accom
panied them. ' They also deny that It was
a Company C affair, there being members
of several other companies In the crowd
-Lieutenant Scott, feeling deeply ag
grieved that the failure of his company
should be placed upon him, went to the
committee about it, learned that it had
heard some idle report concerning him
J^t had not investigated it. Scott has
threatened. a suit for slander and it Is not
at all unlikely that^such a suit wiU be in
stituted. General Muller has. advised him
to ask for a court of inquiry, but he does
not favor the idea. *.-Â¦-.,
FRESNO, May 27.â The recent encamp
ment of the Sixth Regiment, National
Guard, of California, at Merced, was pro
ductive of a regimental quarrel, and a suit
for slander has been threatened by Lieu
tenant .TV. S. Scott of Company C of
Fresno against Lieutenant Colonel Grant
and Majors Whitmore and Stewart, the
committee in charge of the awarding of
prizes. â¢

HORSES RACE
NEAR DAWSON
Manager Price had been with the old
California Jockey Club and was retain
ed as manager when the new organiza
tion was effected. About two -months be
fore the death of the late R. B. . Milroy,
who was assistant secretary of the club,
Mr. Price was elected secretary, in ad
dition to his position as manager. Before
he came to California, Mr. Price was con
nected for many years -with the Louis-.
y*O HARL.ES F. PRICE, secretary and
fl manager .of the New California
IV^^ Jockey Club, has resigned. When
the racing season closed Presi
â¢ dent Thomas H. Williams Jr.
was informed by Mr. Price that he would
probably sever his connection with the
club within a short time.
President Â¦Williams received the for
mal letter of resignation yesterday from
Louisville, Ky. With it was inclosed a
personal note to President Williams
bearing upon the friendly relations which
existed between the club directors and
himself. In confirming the announcement
of Mr. Price's resignation, President Wil
liams said: â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦Â¦ Â¦
"Just before Mr. Price left for his
home in Louisville, after the close of the
season, he told me "he intended to re
sign, his position with the New . Califor
nia Jockey Club. Â¦ There was no signifi
cance to the matter. Mr. Price simply
desired to retire from the employment' of â¢
the club. Our relations are, as they al
ways have been, of the friendliest char
acter. As soon as I received his formal
letter of resignation, I sent him a reply
in line with the pleasant sentiments he
had expressed in his note to me. The
resignation was not unexpected, in view
of what Mr. Price had said to me when
the meeting closed. He went East about
a week after racing ceased at Emery
ville for the season."

'Shall notified Manager Alec Greggaius
yesterday that he would give him until
Saturday next to carry out his verbal
agreement. If he fails to turn over a
certified check or its equivalent in cash
Thall threatens to notify the contestants.
Thall has found that Jeffries' check is
not certified. He therefore must send it
to Harbin Springs in order that "Jim"
can attach his signature to make it -worth
more than the paper on which it is writ
ten. Jeffries did the same thing: in his
contest with Ruhlln. As in the present
instance It was evidently done for a pur
pose. He delayed indorsing the check
until he saw there was no danger of the
fight not taking: place.
Jeffries' trip to Harbin Springs yester
day was made without accident. He was
warmly greeted all along the line. He
has made many friends in the vicinity of
Harbin Springs and they were out In
force to give him a proper greeting. Jim
will begin conditioning himself to-day.
ritzsinrmons has already begun training:
at Skasgs Springs.
Lavigne and Britt have finished training
for their coming contest and from now
en will devote their time to light ex
ercises In order to keep their muscles *in
trim. Lavigne weighed 129 pounds at the
close of his day's training yesterday. He
expects to enter the ring weighing 131
pounds. Britt is In splendid shape and
will enter the ring in condition to put
up a fast fight The sale of seats opened
at Corbett's yesterday. The men will
wei?h in at Corbetfs at 6 o'clock to
morrow night. In what betting was done
yesterday Britt ruled a 10 to 8 choice.
Sam Thall, the -well-known theatrical
manager, who 'was chosen stakeholder of
the Jeffries-Fltzsimmons championship
contest, is worried. His position in the
matter is not as easy as It appears. He
is to be the custodian of checks aggregat

ANNUAL REUNION
OF THE ALUMNI
Graduates of Stanford
Meet at the Festal

Recall College Scenes and
Incidents and Welcome
Class of '02.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 27.â
Roble. Hall was the scene to-day of the
seventh' annual luncheon of the Stanford
University . Alumni Association. The
luncheon was the culmination of the senior
week events, in which" the alumni par
ticipated actively. The early hours of
morning were taken up by the old Stan
ford graduates In the two annual alumni
meetings. To-day was essentially Alumni
day; even in the promenade concert to
night were graduate Influences noted, the
Alumni booth being a center of attrac
tion. - ,
The annual business meeting was called
to order at 10 o'clock- in the law building
by the president of the association, Pro
fessor H. D. Stearns, '93. After listening
to the reports of the secretary-treasurer.
Professor Charles R. Lewers. '96, and of
the chairman of the executive committee.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, '96, the members
of the association chose their officers for
the coming- year, as follows: president,
Leslie J. Hinsdale, '95, an attorney of
Sacramento and president of the student
body In hisundergraduate course at Stan
ford;Arst vice-president, W. J. Neidig, '96.
at present instructor in the department of
English; second vice-president, W. "W.

Lyman Wilbur, '96, professor in the de
partment of physiology, re-elected chair
man; Miss Pearl Greene, '98, assistant in
University Library, and James Taylor
Burcham, instructor in law, re-elected. >
The power of oversight of the "Alum
nus," the official alumni publication, was
delegated to the executive committee/ The
editor for this magazine was not clfosen,
but it Is understood that C. F. "Wright, '96,
will be the next business manager.
TOASTS AND RESPONSES.
The annual alumni luncheon was served
in the spacious dining-room of Roble Hall,
which was - decorated with cardinal car
nations and evergreens. Four hours, from
12:30 until 4:30, were spent at the board.
Professor H. D. Stearns, '93, toastmaster
in hin opening remarks, "To 1902," spoke
of the Stanford graduates out in active
life, urged that they act so as to reflect
credit on the university and welcomed
the graduating class into the ranks of
the alumni. He introduced Frank Hin
man, president of 1902, who responded to
the toast. President Hlnman said in part.
_'WÂ« feel proud to be members of that loyal
Cody of men and women, the Stanford alumni.
We do not care to boast of our future, but
we hope for the sake of the university that It
will be successful. Stanford men and "women
have won honors tn the past and It Is to be
hoped that we may emulate their example.
The next speaker was Professor John
M. Stillman of the chemistry department
who was assigned the subject, "The Old
and the New." Said he:
To the child of 10 years, ten years is a long
time; but to men with hair tinged gray by the
first early frost of autumn, ten years seem
but yesterday. The old "pioneer" graduates
say that there Is something missing nowadays,
that the old home is not what it used to be.
They are-.rlghtâ the old home haa changed;
It is greater, stronger and better to-day.
The speaker referred to the intimate re
lations between faculty and students that
existed .most strongly in the "pioneer"
days; of the broadened sphere of the
university work and the permanent in
fluences to be most highly: valued. In a
closing comparison of "the old- and J the
new" he remarked:
Now, as then. Stanford stands for effective
ness as the test of knowledge â the ability to
know something well and to <\o something well.
Now, as then, we recognize the responsibility
of keeping the tone of the student body high,
of keeping the college atmosphere pure Â¦ and
clear. In the maintenance of these Ideas, let
us say for the university In the words of Jo
seph Jefferson, "May she live long and pros
per."
ENERGY OP WESTERN MEN.
Dr. Harry B. Reynolds. '96, spoke of
"Stanford in the East," referring to the
great number of Stanford men in the East,
their college loyalty and the esteem in
which < they were held by their business,
professional or college . associates. He
"said:
No college represented by alumni in the
Kfcst can show better work done by
her alumni. In all positions where quality
of work and personal consideration enter Into
account. Stanford is well represented. West
ern men have more energy and Initiative,
which make them win where the less coura
geous Easterners fall; but I would criticise the
Western college men for lacking that natural
culture and greater dignity which is displayed
by the Easterners.
Following Dr. Reynolds. H. H. Brown,
*96, very wittily responded to. the toast,
"The Ladies," S. M. Charles, '98, related
the varied experiences of the graduates
of the Stanford law school, speaking on
J The Stanford Lawyer" and Cecil M.
Marrack, '01. cheerfully responded to "A
Year Later."
President Jordan closed the toasts with
some strong and pertinent thoughts on
"The University." President Jordan spoke
in part as follows:
The last time I spoke at an alumni luncheon
I spoke on the "Stone Age.". I shall continue
to talk of the "Stone Age," for we are tn it
still: More buildings are to be erected â a- gym.
nasium. the finest the world over saw, will be
erected next year, and other buildings will
follow. -'.
The university is really comfortably fixed
the long struggle In financial matters, has com*
to an end. We can look through and beyond
our difficulties.
One of the main objects of the university
is tc provide the student with a general educa
tion by maans of thorough work in the under
graduate courses. Many cdlieges tend to de
spise this object and put Inferior Instructors In
the undergraduate departments. This Is the
first year In which we could guarantee to
every undergraduate the fullest education In
everything desired. This year there are men
enough; next year there will be room enough.
This is not going to > an Institution of
great number of students. It Is now and la
going to be small enough so that students may
know the professors and the professors know
the students. We are not going to turn out a
large number of graduates, but we are going
to turn out successful graduatesâ Stanford men
and Stanford women. We are going to be what
we want to be; we stand for working out our
own problems.
The final event of the commencement
week celebration took place to-night
when the promenade concert was ren
dered on the quadrangle. The walks were
beautifully adorned with palms and flow
ers, and, Chinese lanterns contributed to
a scene of remarkable beauty.

and went to a doctor, who said she had
heart trouble. This" worried her a great
deal and she became despondent, but she
never, spoke of taking her own life. Mrs.
Gerdls continued: -
"Last night May's mother came over to
my house and asked where May was and
if she was in the house. When I told
her no she went back home. That* was
about 8 o'clock, and at about 9 o'clock
I saw May coming down the other side of
the street and I ,went downstairs and
called to her to 'come into the house,
saying- her mother had been here and was
looking for her, but she said. 'I am
crazy,", and ran upstairs ahead of . me.
The next thing I heard was a pistol shot
and 'on reaching the top of the stain I
found May lying on the floor with a smok
ing pistol . beside her. I ran down Â¦ and
told a boy to go for a doctor. He soon
returned with Dr. J. H. Soper of 347 Noe
street, who said May was dead. May
was a good girl and never drank, nor had
she anv bad habits." . . \ ,-
May Peters shot herself while standing
in front of a large mirror, with a thirty

through her right temple. . i Death must

. Although Miss Peterg probably intended
taking her own life, as she brouehtthe
pistol with her to the house, she left no
word for any one. In her purse was 11 40
and a note asking her to . come and do
some sewing-.

Veteran Artillery Corps of 1812. An im
mense throng had gathered in the park

the Waldorf-Astoria by members of the
Order of the Cincinnati in commemora
tion Of the victories of the American and
French forces In the War of Independ
ence and of the Institution of the. order.

de Chalendar was j seized with f aintness
and was escorted from the hall. Some
.alarm was felt, but the general soon re
vived and declared that he was merely
overcome by the fatigue of \ the day.
Arriving at the City Hall, the French
men were formally welcomed to the city
by Mayor Low and President Fornes of

Dr. Fralick may conduct experiments In
Los Angeles. He came here at the urgent
solicitation of persons of prominence who
desire him to labor in this city for a time.
If agreeable to the regular medical pro
fession, the doctor may comply with these
requests. ' * â¢ .
Euthuslastlc citizens of 'Phoenix have
offered to build and equip for Dr. Fralick
a sanitarium that is to be. the most com
plete institution of its kind in the world.
Mr. Goebel declares the Fralick discov
ery to be the greatest of the age, ranking
in, importance with Harvey's discovery
or the circulation of the blbod. When cer
tain details are known, Dr. Frallck will
give his formula to the world. Six to
eight treatments are accorded each case,
although patients have been discharged
as cured after three treatments, results
obtained in the severe winter climate of
New York. " . Â¦
Mr. Goebel says Dr. Frallck introduces
a fluid directly into the blood channels
by opening a vein. From four to twenty
ounces of the fluid is introduced in every
infuslon, the injections being given from
three to eight weeks apart, depending
upon the case that is being treated. There
is no discomfort in taking the treatment
It is claimed that the first contact will
destroy the germs and the second will
remove them completely. \A
Dr. Fralick's method was tried in Phoe

New York City, is said to have been suc

The accident occurred just as the head
of the parade had passed the corner. The
French visitors had gone past, and knew
nothing of the accident until some time
later. Troop C had just ridden by and
the Twenty-second Regiment was passing
when the crash came. The officers in
command at once gave the order to break
ranks and fifty militiamen were detailed
to the work of rescue.
NEW YORK, May 27.â Elvln L. Cool-
s idge, 'circulation, manager of the .New
York Commercial, was almost Instantly
killed and about 100 other persons wera
injured this evening by the breaking of a
temporary sidewalk at Fifth avenue and
Eighteenth street. Some of those injured
may. die. Those who fell were part of the
crowd gathered to watch' the parade in
honor of the visit of the French Rocham
beau Commission to this city.
Two thousand persons were on the side
walk when it gave way. They were pre
cipitated twenty feet into an excavation
for a new building and fell on piles of
building material. Considering the nature
of the accident and the number of per
sons in it the hospital surgeons express
surprise at the fact that so few received
injury. Many were able to go, directly
home after having their injuries treated
by the ambulance surgeons.
Those taken to the hospitals and who
sustained the severest injuries are: George
Essing, patrolman, scalp -wound and
shock; James J. Kelley, detective ser
geant attached to Inspector Thompson's
staff, scalp wound and shock, and pos
sible internal injuries; M. J. McManus,
patrolman, three ribs broken and con
tusions; Charles Werner, contusions of
body and internal injuries.
Coolidge, who was killed, received a
fracture of the skull. Coolidge had served
on the staff of the Boston Journal and
the Boston Globe, and had been con
nected with several city papers during his
stay in this city.
Early in the afternoon the police became
suspicious of the strength of the side
walk and a detail for hours kept tha
crowd from collecting on it." But as the
time for the parade to pass came near tho
crowd became unmanageable and in spite
of force on the part of the police crowded
bn to the forbidden sidewalks and there
stayed until the breaking of the support
landed. them in the excavation. The Cor
oner ordered the arrest of Contractor
Cowan, and of J. G. Miller, the sub
contractor. . '

who room at the Bay View lodging-house,
at Alameda Point', slept blissfully and
snored loudly/ last night a bold ..burglar
ransacked the building from, top to bot
tom and made off with $70 In coin, several
watches and bed sheets and an assort
ed collection of collar buttons. The thief
met with no difficulty in entering the
rooms of the lodgeys, who 'are nearly all
addicted to the honest and healthful
habit of sleeping with their room doors
open. He found most of them in and
resting peacefully. The busy burglar did
not disturb their slumbers. He selected
whatever was handy and good- to steal.
In trying to make his way out of the
room of Thomas Thompson, after holding
up and going through the pantaloons
owned by that gentleman, the thief fell
over a chair and awakened t.he sleeper.
Thompson declares that the burglar
thereupon ordered him at the point of a
pistol to duck his head 'under the blank
ets, where it was cosy and comfortable
and not so dangerous. avers
that -he Instantly obeyed orders, ducked
and forgot to ask any questions.
When Thompson heard the thief depart
by the front door route he arose, aroused
some of the other lodgers and organized
a posse to pursue the man with the loot.
The burglar was followed to the railroad
yards at Alameda Point and there all
trace of him was lost. , The sheets were
found to-day hidden in a box car. - City
Marshal John Conrad is inclined to be
lieve that the thief got out of town on an
early freight train this morning.

Town Trustees have established new wat
er rates In that town which can, be so.
Juggled by the Contra Costa Water Com
pany that an Increase of 80 per cent
over present figures can be collected.
The company secures : a meter rate of
27 cents a hundred cubic feet, or 36 cents
a thousand gallons, which is IS cents a
thousand more than the present
rate. The, minimum charge for water by
meter will be $150 instead of $125 as at

The ordinance falls to impose any pen
alty for collection of rates greater than
the law. provides. It is also left optional
with the company to enforce a meter rate
or a fiat rate against the consumer. The
ordinance was passed because* the water
company had threatened suit against the

COLLEGE COMPLEXIONS
Nothing so surely mars a woman's com-
plexion a* coffee drinking. A young col-
lege girl- Cf Hyattsvllle, Md., says: "I
never drank coffee up to the time I went
to college, and as long as you are not go-
Ing to publish my name will admit that I
was proud of my pink and white com-
plexion, but for some reason I began
drinking coffee at "school and when vaca-
tion came I looked like a wreck. Was ex-
tremely nervous and my face hollow and
callow.
"All my friends said college live had
been too much for me. After question-
ing me about tny diet, mother gave me a
cup of strong, rich coffee at breakfast, al-
though formerly she had objected to the
habit, but the secret came out In a few
weeks when everybody began to comment
on my improved looks and- spirits. She
Eaid ehe had been steadily giving me

"My color. came back, much to- my de-
light, and I was fully restored to health.
I will return to college without the slight-
est fear of losing ground, for I know ex-
actly where the trouble lies. * '. i"
"Mother says the first time ehe .had
Postum made no one would drink It, for
It was pale and watery, but the next day
ebe did not trust to the cook, but examin-
ed the directions and made, it herself.
Ebe* found the copk had just let it come
to the boiling point and then served it,
and it was tasteless, but the beverage
made according to directions, by proper
boiling. Is delicious and has a remarkable

"I have a young lady friend who suf-

"As a Director of this board I resent
that, sir, and I deny you the privilege of
using such language in these ropms."
"I will speak as I please to you," said
Latimer. "It is plain to see now where
you stand and that you have been on the
,6ide of Blanchard all the time."
At this point hostilities ceased with the
eld of Director Mark, who Induced Wood
ward to walk away.
"What is a reprimand to a man like
Blanchard?" said Latimer. "Why, any
man who will beat a little boy as young
Raggio was beaten is a brute."
Blanchard, -who entered the room at
these words, smiled, but Director Wood
ward walked toward Latimer with his
finger pointed at him. saving:
When Latimer reached the anteroom, he
met Director Woodward and said that If
anybody had whipped Woodward's boy as
Blanchard had beaten John Raggio,' the
castigator would never have had the op
portunity to appear as a defendant in a
trial. Woodward replied that the charge
of excessive punishment had been dis
posed of by the reprimand which'had been
administered to Blanchard. â¢ '
When the trial was resumed yes
terday Itlss Perry was put ' on the
stand to correct some unimportant tes
timony she gave on the pre
vious day. After she had concluded,
Latimer, to the astonishment of every one
present, unceremoniously left the room,
followed by Miss Perry. Latimer, before
leavW, filed a statement in which he up
braided the School Directors for their
course in having excluded evidence to
ehow that Blanchard had been cruel to
John Raggio, a pupiL The board by a
vote of 3 to 1 on Monday ruled that the
principal had been sufficiently punished by
receiving a reprimand, much to l>atimer's
disgust.
"When Latimer -had retired from, the
meeting-room President Denman wanted
to go on with the trial, but Woodward
thought it should be postponed until an
other attorney had been secured for the
prosecution. It was thought that Superin
tendent Webster might be prevailed upon
to act and in that event the hearing will
be resumed this morning.
Latimer injected himself into the case

said that he was the attorney of Miss

The objectionable clause Is that -which
prohibits brotherhood unions from belong
ing to any central body other than the"
Building Trades Council. It was the re
fusal of Carpenters' Union 4S3 to abide by
the constitution. in this regard that pro
voked the present trouble.
The district council of the brotherhood
met last night and received encouraging
reports from all quarters. The men were
standing firm, and the prospects of early
victory were said to be excellent. Never
theless, the men are willing to consider
any plan to bring- about a settlement, but
owing to the strength developed by them
recently they refuse to make what they
term to be unreasonable concessions to
the McCarthy faction.
A committee of the Builders Protective
Association met a number of the brother
hood carpenters * yesterday and discussed
propositions of .bringing about peace be

proposed plan of re-afflliation with the
Building Trades Council unless the con
stitution of the council is amended to the
satisfaction of the brotherhood unions.

THE marriage of Miss Marie
Juliette Williams of San Rafael to
Alexander ; Ulley of Columbus,
Ohio, was solemnized at the home
of the bride's grandmother, Mrs.
J." R. Nell, on Sixth street, San Rafael,
yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock. Rev.
Wyllys Hall of St. Paul's Episcopal
Church of that city performed the cere
mony. The couple stood under a bower
of La France roses, smilax and ferns in
the main parlor. Mrs. Walter Hobart,
sister of the bride, was matron of honor,
while A. J. Dibblee of Ross Valley acted
as best man. Little Miss Hanna and Miss
Ruth Hobart, aged 4 and 6 years respec
tively, were bridesmaids. The wedding
was a quiet affair, only the relatives and
immediate friends having been invited.
After the ceremony the' newly married
couple and guests, there being about
seventy-five of the latter, partook of a
bountiful repast.
It was generally understood by all
guests present that Mr. and Mrs. Lilley
would leave on the 5:10 p. m. train from
the San Rafael station for San Francisco,
but to the contracting parties this was by
no means the plan-. In order to avoid the
customary rice and old shoe, a horse and
bug-gy were procured and left standing
just ahead of the coach which was sup
posed to convey the wedding party to the
train. Mr. And Mrs. Lilley on leaving the
house rushed tÂ» the buggy and speedily
outdistanced the rest of the party. In
stead of driving to the San Rafael station,
Mr. and Mrs. Lilley drove to Greenbrae,
about five miles away, and there boarded
the train. The couple will consume about
six weeks on their wedding trip, touring
the East, after which they will return to
San Rafael to remain the rest of the sum
mer.
Th: matter will be heard by Presiding
Judge Cook, who; on reading the com
plaint, assigned the case to his own de
partment. An early hearing is promised.
That plaintiffs bo awarded the costs of suit
herein, and such olher and further relief as
may be meet and 3uÂ»t In the premises.
That It be decreed that said T. A. Rottanzl,
J. C. Stinson. M. E. Van Meter and A. S. Ad
ler are the duly appointed and qualified mem
bers Of said Board of Health and that they be
awarded the possession and enjoyment of said
offices. . - -
That it bo decreed that said defendants have
no right, title or interest whatsover, and that
neither or any of them has any right, title or
interest whatsoever in or to said offices of
members of said Board of Health, but that de
fendants and each and every of them wrong

and exercise . said offices; and that It be ad-
Judged that said defendants and each of . them
are guilty of usurping. Intruding into and un

An action was- filed In the Superior
Court yesterday for the ejectment from
office of the Board of Health recently
removed by Mayor Schmltz and the In
duction Into power of the gehtiemen. ap
pointed by -the j city's executive as their
successors. .The action was one in quo
warranto : and .'Jaeing brought on tho re
lation of F. T. Finch, a tax-payer, with
the consent of : Attorney General Ford,
tho decision of the court, however it may
be, will stay all proceedings pending ap
peal Vo the Supreme Â¦ Court. 4 '
The^ suit , was filed un with,
the tenor of Judge Sloss' decision ren
dered some days Â¦ ago In the Board of
Health -case. The court refused to pass
upon the; power of the Mayor to remove
the Board of Health in that proceeding,
and held that a decision could . only be
reached In an action in quo warranto.
'Attorney^ A. Ruef , . representing Mayor
Sohmite, applied to the Attorney Gen
eral for leave to file such a suit and, on
securing permission, Ruef 's clerk became
the relator. Â¦ It is now certain that the
merits of the case will be determined by
the court. .
The complaint' alleges that Mayor
Schmitz, while acting in a legal capac
ity, investigated the conduct of the mem
bers of the Board, of Health and found
from such investigation that the official
conduct of the defendants "was detri
mental to the interests of the city and
county of * San Francisco and that they
were guilty of official misconduct, had
not executed their duties properly, and
had not fulfilled their official obligations
In their said offices as members of the
Board of Health, and that It was neces
sary for and to the "best interests. of said
city and county of San Francisco that
said defendants should be removed from
their said offices as members of said
Uoard of Health, so held by them .as
aforesaid." N
Acting on legal advice, the Mayor on
March 25 removed the defendants from
office and each was notified in wrltltg
of such removal, the communication re
lating the cause for removal, which was
the injury done this city by reason of the
false declaration by the board that bu
bonic plague existed here. 'At the same
time the Mayor appointed as successors
Drs. T. A.'Rottanzi, J. C. Stinson, MY E.
Van Meter and A. S. Adler. The com
plaint goes on to Say that notwithstand
ing ' the gentlemen named are legally
members of the Board of Health, the de
posed officials refuse to vacate their of
fice and, "each of the said defendants
usurps," intrudes into and unlawfully
holds and exercises said public office
without right, assumes to, and does ex
ercise the said office and the functions
thereof." Â¦ â¢ v -

69 75. with considerable selling. The current

scaling of the monthly, dividend from 75c per

of the latter amount having Ju*t been declared.
This decrease in the dividend is due to the

2CEW YORK... May 27,â Tj8.-day's stock mar
ttt'-irai- an" irreeular drop' over a fractional
range" for the" most part below yesterday's
closing" .level. " There were a few exceptions
among minor stocks. The recent demand for
Wisconsin Central stocks continued, accom
panied by rumors of buying for; control. There
was an upward movement in Sugar when the
report reached Wall street of a conference of
Senators to attempt an agreement upon reci
procity, but the stock dropped back when the
conference adjourned without action. A rise
of nearly 2 iiolnts in American Locomotive
seemed a supplement to that of yesterday In
the car stocks. Pressed Steel Car reacted
-sharply over 3 points on the emphatic denial
of yesterday's rumors of a merger with the
American Car Company. Canadian Pacific
continued by far the most active stock in the
list. It dropped sharply 2Vi in the first few
minutes- of trading, but was rallied by arbi
trage buying from Canadian centers, where the
etock continued at figures above the New York
level. The reason was considered a result of
the speculation which has followed the rise,
but conviction remains in Wall street that im
portant developments are pending In the prop
erty. The .absence of developments, in the
coal strike situation did not prevent the re
pressive influence exercised by the strike,
which is emphasized by the increasing scarcity
of coal and the growing effect on other indus
tries. The Government's weekly crop bulletin
may have some unfavorable effect because of
the delay to seeding of the corn crop reported.
A batch of favorable railroad earnings in
cluding the net showing for April of a num
ber of important systems and good increases in
gross earnings for the third week in May of
others was without apparent effect In the mar
ket. The money market has grown so easy,
at cr below 3 per cent for call loans, as to
have lost importance as a factor. Opinion is
by no means acreed in Wall street as to the
effect upon this market of a declaration of
peace in South Africa. The small effect pro
duced here in contrast with the speculative ac
tivity abroad by the current rumors of peace
awakened conjecture here. Of course,- there
is the possibility of a miscarriage of the nego
tiations, but there is also a possibility, that
the activity In speculation and - Investment
aroused by the end of the South African war
will be diverted into foreign securities shaken
down as they have been by a long period of
liquidation following industrial depression. An
awakening of speculative and industrial ac
tivity abroad would be likely to lead to the
withdrawal of large amounts of foreign -capi
tal placed in New York in bankers' loans. The
effect could hardly be salutary in American
financial affairs. - Â¦>

Weather Report.
Sacramento Valley â Weather conditions dur
ing the Â» week have been nearly normal and
favorable for growing crops. . Very little dam
age was done by the high winds of last week,
but much of the moisture in the soil was ab
sorbed and showers would be beneficial. Grain
is filling well and there is a good growth of
straw; heavy crops are probable in nearly all
places. Haying Is progressing rapidly and
there is a heavy yield of excellent hay. The
first crop of alfalfa has been secured in Sacra
mento County. Apricots are reported of large
i:ze at Fair Oaks; they are ripening rapidly
and the first shipment to the East was made
trom Winters on the 21st. eleven days later
than last season. There will be a large crop
of almondE. All deciduous fruits are in excel
lent condition and heavy crops are expected.
Blackberries are ripening. Vineyards are
thrifty. Orange trees are heavily laden with
blossoms.
Coast and Bay Sections â The weather dur
ing the week has been cool and partly cloudy
or foggy, retarding somewhat the growth of
grain and ripening- of deciduous fruits. The
high winds of last week caused but little dam
age to fruit, but dried the soil and injured pas
turage. Light cbowers would be very benefi
cial. Grain is in very good condition except in
the southern counties, where it Is reported
much of the wheat and barley will be cut for
hay. Haying is progressing in nearly all sec
tions and good crops are the rule in the central
tnd northern districts; all hay is excellent in
quality. Prune trees in the vicinity of Santa
Rosa are being considerably damaged by can
ker worm; the prune crop will probably be
light in most sections. Apricots are of large
size and will yield a good crop. Cherries are
ripening rapidly; the yield will be less than
average in many places. A good crop of Bart
lett pears is expected. Vineyards, and citrus
fruits are doing well.
Ban Joaquin Valley â Cool, clear weather has
prevailed during the week, with slightly higher
temperature at the close. Strong northerly
Â¦winds have Ellghtly damaged the fruit crop in
tome places and injured grain considerably in
the southern districts by absorbing the mois
ture in the soil. In the central and northern
districts wheat. Is maturing rapidly and there
will be a heavy crop. Early barley Is ripe in
Madera County. Grain harvest will commence
In a few days; some barley In Fresno County
has been harvested. A large crop of hay is
being gathered. Alfalfa la unusually heavy,
but mixed with foxtail In Kern County. Pas
turage is good. Irrigation water is plentiful.
Deciduous fruits are in excellent condition and
food crops are probable. Wlneyards and citrus
fruits are thrifty.
Southern California â Clear, cool weather has
continued during the week, with fogs along the
coast. Drying- winds have been injurious to
grain and hay. but have caused very little
damage' to fruit. Late grain 'and hay are in
bad condition, ftnd the yield will be very light.
Much 1& being cut for hay. â¢ The hay
crop is reported of better quality than average.
Beans are up and looking well, though needing
warmer weather. Sugar beets are growing
rapidly. Deciduous fruits are in good condition
In most places; apricots will be light in Orange
County. Vineyards are reported in excellent
condition. Walnuts and citrus fruits are doing
well.
Lob Angeles Summary â Cold week, with con
siderable cloudiness and fog; ehowers at the
close were too light to do good. Haying con
tinues; late crop about failure. No -damage
reported from wind storm, except the drying
out of moisture.
Eureka Summary â Crops are all planted in
most sections; In some localities early, sown
rrain Is heading short. Trees are loaded with
fruit. Green feed ie plentiful.
Cool, generally clear weather has continued
durlr.g the week, with fogs along the coast.
Light sprinkles of rain have fallen in some sec
tions. Brisk northerly winds have prevailed
"In the valleys.
Early barley Is ripe and ready for harvest in
portions of the San Joaquin Valley and wheat
is maturing rapidly. Harvest will probably
commence early in June. Grain continues in
excellent condition in the central and northern
cistricts and heavy crope are expected. In the
southern districts wheat and barley are re
ported in very bad condition and the crop is
being cut for nay. Hay is yielding a heavy
crop in most places north of Tehachapl and is
of excellent quality. Alfalfa is unusually
heavy. Beans, bops, sugar beets and garden
. vegetables are in good condition and growing
rapidly. Pasturage ie plentiful in most places-.
The damage to deciduous fruits by the wind
end rain of last week was less than anticipated
and there will not be much shortage in the
yield on that account. Apricots are reported of
large size and are now ripening rapidly, . Cher
ries are of excellent quality and the yield will
not be far below average. The prune crop will
be light In many places, owing to blight, and
canker worm. Other deciduous fruits and vine
yards are In excellent condition. Orange trees
are heavily laden with blossoms. Walnuts are
doing well, but a light crop is probable.' . Â¦

- - Â¦- Butter. p Cheese -and Eggs.
!â Things are beginning; to look interesting
again In the Butter trade. ; The exchange will
issue no more quotations while the present â¢
competition- lasts, and -this leaves every dealer;
to himself. . There . Is a fight ' on - hand, and It ,
promises to be lively. "Â¦ There, is a short ele- '
rnent with contracts made some time ago, and
opposed to it ia another Interest, and between
the two the market is being forced up. The :
shorts are not averse to -a rise, on the theory
that' the higher the market goes the lower it
will drop later on and the quicker It will get
there. Any pronounced' advance- would shut off
the packing, in which case stocks would accu
mulate and the- market would decline. At pres
ent the market is- kept up by the packing and
good orders for- Alaska, and other outlets, and
as high as 22c is being quoted by some dealers,
though the majority ' do not quote over 21c.
Dairy is bringing almost as much as creamery, ,
as will be seen. ..-.-'Â¦Â¦ i
Cheese continues plentiful and weak at un- j
changed prices.
Â¦ . Eggs are firm and' 20c is now being obtained,
but it takes a fine large ranch Egg to bring this
figure, and then only Â¦ In a limited way. Re
ceipts are* ample,- but spot stocks are not large,
and the demand is very fair. Imoorters of
Eastern Eggs are disposed to help the market
up as fast as possible, in order to favor the,
. Eastern importations. " . â¢ . Â¦
Receipts were 59,300 pounds, 2 kegs and 724

The usual quantity of Strawberries was re- !

Fancy Oranges are scarce and the top quo
tation is easily obtained for desirable sizes.
Supplies of poor grades are plentiful and sell .
slowly at the appearing quotations. One or
two cars will be auctioned to-day. Five cars of.
Bananas were received from New Orleans and
the Honolulu steamer arrived with fresh sup- ,
Plies.

New Apricots, July delivery, are quoted at;
6%c. - The output Is expected to be large, esti
mates running as high as 1300 to 1400 cars, i
against 400 last year. Peaches promise a large
crop, while Pears are admitted by everybody ;
to, be short, except- On the river. The Prune
output will probably exceed that of last year,
but will not be heavy, and will have po left
over stock to contend with this year. Apples
rule firm at the good- prices, but there is not
much doing in any fruit, owing to the practical
exhaustion of stocks.
Walnuts are firm and In few hands. Raisins \
are nominal. Honey is quiet, with expectations
of a much lighter crop than thought some

CHICAGO, May'. 27.â After .making good
gains corn easily took the., lead again to-day by
a point . In activity and gains. The trading
throughout the session was very strong and the
buying that put. up prices was of the best char
acter. ' Everything favored | the bulls. Â¦ â¢ Cold
weather started .the upturn, but decreased
stocks, smaller receipts Â¦ with smaller. to come,
higher cables and a good cash demand were the
added influences that frightened. the shorts into
thinking their day of reckoning had come. July
corn opened %@%c to %c up at 63%c to 63%@
63 %c, Jumping to 64 %c and closing strong; %@
%c ud at 64%c. , J
Wheat made further : moderate' advances to
day. The corn strength as much as anything
was the factor. General sentiment was bullish
but there were some bullish influences at work.
In the main the commission houses are getting
a little more. business from the country and the
pit consequently showed a more fairly active
condition. Cables were slightly higher, and In
fluenced only a steady, opening. Crop prospects
were still very good, and cash demand and the
premium for cash over the manipulations. were
the principal factors.- . Traders were paying
some, attention to reports of officials of the
Great Northern Railway, that - the Northwest
has practically no wheat offered, and up to date
this road has carried 55,000 bushels of wheat.
Bradstreet'a visible supply showed a decrease
of 2,779,000 bushels and Influenced' some ad
vances. July opened a shade lower to a shade
higher at 73%@73%c, sold to 74%c and closed
firm, %@%c up.at 74%c. - t
Oats followed corn -and wheat. July closed
ftrm %@%c higher at 37%@37%c.
Provisions-' were very strong eariy on the
higher, prices for hogs and on the very small
offerings. The sentiment was very bullish for
a time and. there was a good packers' support.
Commission houses' did some fair buying.
Toward the close the profit-taking caused a loss
of some advance but the tone was still strong.
July pork closed 10c up, lard 5@7%c higher and
ribs 7%Â®10c up. --'' " v . Â¦

y - Before a vote was taken Supervisor Box
ton asked. where the money for the elec
tions was to come from. Braunhart re
plied that he knew of several depart
ments that could stand a "shave" in
their appropriations and the money saved
would pay for the elections.
Braunhart, as chairman of the Commit
tee on Public Utilities, reviewed the his
tory of the proceedings of that commit
tee in preparing for the proposed bond
issues for public improvements. He stat
ed that it was the desire of. the com
mittee to proceed slowly In the matter
on account of the probability of having
the issue declared Invalid owing to some
unforeseen technicality. For that reason
not a single step was taken without eoa
sultlng-the legal, adviser of the board.
Braunhart further said that one of the
most important elections would be that
of submitting ) proposed Â¦. charter amend
ments to a vote. The charter is ambig
uous on the question of whether separ
ate elections shall be held f pr each pub
lic improvement. City Attorney Lane has
advised that . this is the safest course
However, one amendment making it pos
sible to submit: all propositions -to a vote
at the same election will be submitted in
order to take no .chances in proceeding
illegally in the premises. **-

Mission^ Federation Points Out Where '
Saving May Be^ Effected.
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs held a special meeting yesterday for
the purpose of : analyzing f the various
items in the i pro'posed tax . budget as
recommended by the Finance Comnfittee
of the Board of Supervisors with a view
to pointing out where certain expenditures
cculd be lopped off/ As a result of the
investigation- the Federation decided to
submit., the -following- requests to the
Board of Supervisors:
The engineering bureau is allowed $00,000
whereas irom the small allowance made for
improvements there will be ,very ' little en
gineering to be done. The sum alleged for
l"o \m> nS sl > ould be reduced by at leas.1
; In vie* of the fact that there is very little
money allowed the Board . of Public Works to
expand for repairs and permanent Improve
ments the salary allowance is excessive and
should be reduced at least one-half i The

!â¢ Â»^ s nd ,* 6 Â°.0Â«0 'or engineering to expend
$25.). 625 for repairs .and improvements on
streets, sewers buildings, etc. The balance of
the appropriation is for work done by contract
th ej inspection > of which is taken out of â¢ the
various appropriations.
JThe first election will be held for the
purpose of submitting" to a vote of the
people the proposition of acquiring the
Geary. Street Railroad. The second elec
tion is for the purpose of submitting
charter amendments including one to pro
vide for the submission of all proposed
public improvements at one election. At
the third election electors will vote on
the bond issue for. public utilities and
improvements. . . - Â¦
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution providing j that a
sufficient sum of money be appropriated
for the holding of three special elections
during the next fiscal year.
Dr.- Lyon went on' to 'explain that' those
who were treated this ' way were always
natives who had i committed " some capital
crime. . He said that he. had never seen
a : Filipino thrown , down and gagged and
water forced down his mouth. . v . . Â¦'.; ,
eenth Infantry and often had to, act as
chaplain as ..well- as doctor. I. and other
officers found that the ' 'water â¢â¢ cure* was
the best way \ to frighten a Filipino, be
cause they are all superstitious and when
they get filled with water they are afraid
they are going to drown. Now they don't
want to "die without making their-confes
sion to a priest and . receiving extreme
unction, so when they have taken a few
drinks -of water they give up and tell all
they know.- . .- Â¦ : - . .-. - â¢
"I have tried 'the .'water cure* for ex
periment and so .have the other officers
who were with me. ( I found that I j could
take Just'three pints." ' â¢ -â¢Â¦Â¦; â¢:
Dr. LÂ»yon- weighs -fully 22o Â¦ pounds and
whether he expected a diminutive Fili
pino to contain as much water as himself
will 'probably be lost to history, as he did
not express his. belief on the .subject.
"There is no real physical pain in forc
ing a man to drink a limited amount of
water," the doctor continued. â¢ "There is,
certainly, I must- confess, a- personal in
convenience â you become^ very sick ' at the
stomach, but you soon get over this. ,.
"I have. heard it stated- 1 . that American
soldiers have made Filipinos â¢ drink . can

On May 8, 1889, W. M. Brackett, super
intendent: of. police of Minneapolis, caused
to be issued .circulars offering $100 reward
for i* the - apprehension of Charles Start,
wanted fOr embezzlement^ and 'a copy of
this circular : was received by. the San
Francisco department, and placed on file.
It will .be remembered that during the lu*
vestigation. of-Hadley's. connection with
the Fuller. case it was discovered that hi3
mother resided in Chicago - and her name
was' Start;/ The description; given 'in the
circular would fit -Hadley . â¢, to a nicety, al
lowing for the: years â¢ that have -elapsed
since he fled from. Minneapolis. His ar
rival in i San Francisco tallies '.with the
date of the. circular. The police have no
doubt that the embeszler is Hadley, more
especially- as -they- have information that
confirms : the' circular.,; .â¢ : â¢ â¢ . :
In making a search of the records of

The remains were removed to the family
residence, 1010 .Fiilmore street. Harris
was a â¢ prominent member of the Society
of California Pioneers and that organiza

It was Harris who arrested Howeli; the
famous counterfeiter, who' ( operated a
: bogus Â¦Â¦Â¦ money plant ! near ! Stockton and
circulated Â¦ the spurious coin all over the
country... Harris worked hard to convict
Howeli, but after three trials Howeli was
acquitted on a technicality.
Harris ;was always a strong Democrat
in politics and when the- Republican ad
ministration came into power he was
forced to resgin as Secret Service Agent.
For the last six years he lead a retired
life,' attending only. to. private business af
fairs. . " . 'â¢ ' . . " ; . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
In ,1880 Harris removed Ho Contra Costa

estate. In 1882 he was appointed by Presi
dent Cleveland as United . States Secret
Service Agent and in that office .he fur
ther ; distinguished himself by making
many notable arrests. .: -
Harris 'was one 'â¢; of the trio Â« of :" Sheriffs
whose hunting down. of Mexican outlaws
made . them famous all over,, the country-
His two associates were Tom Cunningham
of, San Joaquln and Harry Morse , of Ala
meda. Cunningham died some time* ago
and Morse "is now the. sole s*urvivbr. of the
famous 1 trio who did'so much 'to rid the
State of the criminal/element.:; : Â¦
'; Harris-. was' born; in Boston sixty-six
years ago arid came to California: in the
days of the Â¦; gold excitement. He crossed
the plains in 1852 and engaged in mining
in the northern part- of -the State. After
a varied experience in .the mining .camps
he settled in San- Jose in the early '70' s.
Sjj He was. elected Sheriff of Santa Clara
County a few years later, and served in
that capacity for twelve years. While in
.the Sheriff's office he. earned a great repu
tation for himself by capture of many
notorious ..criminals who infested the
State in. those days. He was known as a
courageous and honest official. - -Â¦-Â¦'
