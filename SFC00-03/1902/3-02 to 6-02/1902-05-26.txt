VOLUME XCIâ NO. 177.
FURTHER proof is presented to-day by The Call to shew that Warden Martin G. Aguirre of San
Quentin prison certified to forged bills of accounts, prepared by. convicts and foisted by the Warden
and his associates upon the the Board of. Examiners and the State
Comptroller, thereby obtaining goods by fraud and other felonious acts.
The records at San Quentin prison have, been falsified by convicts in order to cover up stealing of,
State supplies of foodstuffs, by Warden Aguirre, which have been enjoyed by Governor Henry T. Gage
and' other bosom friends of the Warden.
. ' As a sample of the vast amount of foodstuffs drawn by Aguirre from the commissary department of,
San, Quentin prison, The. Cull publishes to-day a list of supplies drawn by Aguirre in March last and the
cash values of the same: The items and figures were copied last week from the prison records. The docu
ments at San Quentin show on their face notations to charge the bulk of the supplies to other accounts.

California. There is a general demand
from citizen* of a!! classes 'that an im

made by the Board of Prison Directors
and that the fair name of the common

Aguirre has frequently entertained
Governor Gage and his family, in addi

executive â¢ of ' the State/, retired to rest,
while, a guest of 'Aguirre, clad in a
charming robe de - riuit. , trimmed , with
lacc'arid'other Ceaainine knick-knacks.;
In the list of goods ordered was an
item of one dozen ladies' night gowns.
Warden .Aguirre is a single man and
garments of feminine wear do not figure
in prison supplies sent to . a Warden's
house.- 'Aguirre certainly did not wear
the .robes de nuit, and the question
naturally arises as to the identity of the
person? for. whom the dainty articles
were destined.

In' April of last year a verbal order, for

This bill was certified to as being cor

hidden up in the commissary stock book
by the work of the convict bookkeepers.
An item of $2 for binding tape was
added to the amount of the bill and en
tered up as a total of $36 20.
The articles billed by Levi Strauss &
Co. on Aprili3, 1901, were entered on
the commissary books and charged to
the Warden's house under the heading
of "F. and F.," which means "furnish

STATE RECORDS PRESENTS
While fully conceding the grave responsibil
ity assumed by a subordinate officer in will
fully disobeying an order of his commanding
officer, etlll .the' weighty reasons related, with
which Lieutenant Day was acquainted, so
tainted Major Waller's order that Lieutenant
I Day should have been prompted to positive dis
obedience. An officer must be conscientiously
regardful of the unquestioned legality of his
agency In taking the lives ofhia fellowmen.
Above . and beyond all personal consideration,
officers must guard the name and honor of the
country. Had Lieutenant Day been actuated
by such considerations he would probably have
prevented one of the most regrettable incidents
in the annals of the military service of the
United States. â¢ ' ;
The accused knew . that for three weeki
Waller had undergone a test of his mental and
physical endurance such as few men are called
upon to suffer. .
Giving heed ; to the mental attitude of Major
Waller, as much of the findings of the court
as are to the effect that Major Waller Is not
guilty of murder are approved. But the re
viewing- authority is . at a loss to understand
why the court did not find against Major
Waller In the minor offense. With the excep
tion noted, the acquittal, aa it appears in the
record of the proceedings, is disapproved.
Referring to the case ot Lieutenant Day,
the reviewing authority says:
The marines in Samar underwent (Treat suf
fering before their rescue and their officers on
their sick beds voiced the revengeful anger of
the men who telephoned to Major Waller, ad
vising that the stevedores be killed. Major
Waller received this message while he was
sick from a fever, suffering: acute pain of body
due to exposure and his exertions in behalf of
his men, and mental anguish concerning their
fate, which had long been in doubt. Major
Waller was at the time In teleshonic com
munication with General Smith, who com
manded the American forces in. Samar, but he
deliberately chose not to consult General Smith
regarding his contemplated action, and, rather
than forego the execution of his unrestrained
will, he assumed the jfower the . laws of war
and the' customs of the service confer upon
commanding officers only In time of war.
The sending of tlie natives In Question to
their deaths partdofe more ot unlawful retalia
tion than a "justifiable act of war.' In justica
to the American military service the findings
ot acquittal demand that they shall not meet
with unqualified approval.

Several of the party, including the
Count and Countess de Rochambeau and
the Count de Lafayette, visited Arling?

escorted through the grounds by Captain
Lewis of the Second Cavalry.
An unexpected feature of the afternoon
aid . one that pleased the vlsotors very
much was the invitation from President
Roosevelt to accompany him and sev
eral others on a horseback ride. The en
tire party assembled in front of the
White House at 4 o'clock, the visitors in
their uniforms making a very pretty pic

While in the . park . a storm began to
â gather, and the party came home at a
lively canter. The rain overtook- them,
. however, and before â¢ reaching their stop

Roosevelt, his son Theodore and daugh

As confirming the probability that peace
is not distant, the Right Hon. R. J. Sed
don, the Premier of New Zealand, who
is now visiting here, has sent a cablegram
home in which he salfl:
Commandant Beyers, a few months ago
an active combatant, is now president of
another miniature commonwealth in the
extreme northern portion of the Trans

the present negotiations.
PRETORIA, May 25.â The Boer deputa

Vereening continue. Nothing definite
as to the result is known, but it is
believed the negotiations are proceeding
favorably. At the. celebration of Victoria
day yesterday, a large crowd gathered
in the square here, expecting to hear a
proclamation of peace. There were no
disturbances.
A new feature of the South African sit
uation has been added by the establish
ing of separate republics remote from
Pretoria. Piet de Villiars has been elect
ed president of the republic, of Sange

more probable tEat a week or ten days-j

are made. It is learned front a trust- j
worthy source that there was a division !
of opinion in the- Cabinet respecting the J
answer . as to what was required when j
General Kitchener and Lord Milner tele- j
graphed the suggestions offered by .the :
Boer leaders. It was not a serious con- j
flict, but a natural difference of views' be- |
twten the more eaÂ£y going members of |
the Cabinet and Chamberlain himself, j
who is more suspicious, and a more prac- j
cal man of business than his colleagues j
Some political gossips persist ki assert
ing that Chamberlain Inreatened- to re- j
Bign his office if certain precautions were i
neglected. This is hardly Credible, ta |
Chamberlain would hardly risk this un- 1
popularity by bringing on a political crisis i
a few weeks before the coronation: and,
moreover, his personal ascendency in the
Cabinet -is too marked to warrant the be
lief that serious resistance was offered I
to his will, it is probable the proposals !
of the Boer leaders related to the imme- i
diate release of prisoners and complete j
end unreserved amnesty for the Cape reb- j
els and that Chamberiain was less flexi- !

expected to occur early next week.
Sj>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
Meetings of railroad men to discuss the
advisability of refusing to handle non
union and- bituminous coal I during the
progress of the miners' strike were held
in Wllkesbarre, Kingston and Ashley this
afternoon. .
The WilkeEbarre meeting: was more
largely attended than the one [ Friday
evening. It was stated that no action had
been taken. The meeting at Kingston
agreed to take the matter up next week.
The Ashley meeting indorsed the -miners'
strike and will render financial aid. The
railroad brotherhoods with headquarters
In this city, will alpo give financial as
sistance, but It is .said will not resort to
a sympathetic strike.
The strikers here are inclined to look
with favor on the action of the mine
workers' conference at Huntington "W
Va.. In ordering a strike of the miners
in Virginia and West Virginia. They
think. It will hasten the crisis in the an
thracite region. . .
Secretary Mullah of the Stationary Fire
men's Union reported to-day that the poll
oÂ£ the men employed at the various col
lieries has just been completed, and that
over 90 per cent of the men will quit work
on June 2 unless an eight-hour day is
granted them. Another officer of the
union, says the percentage of engineers
who will quit work will not be nearly as
large. The percentage of the pumpmen
who will come out is not known If the
local operators are to be believed it will
be small.
FIREMEN READY TO QUIT.
.iA^L 1 ls bein S made Dv each side, and
that of the operators will be completed
TueBday. By that time they will know
how many men they may rely upon to
work at the fires, engines and pumps after
a week from Tuesday. â¢Â¦ Â» :
_This was the quietest Sunday in the

one was: on. duty. -.- _ _.
circular sent v out yesterday by
President Mitchell warning the Polish,
Slavish and Llthuian miners to remain
away from the bituminous region of Vir
ginia and West Virginia, where strikes
are now in progress, was read in many
of the churches. Some of the clergy
urged the strikers to be lawabiding and
be guided by their, leaders so long as
the leaders were -faithful to the trust
reposed in them.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., May 25â The
losses during tlie.nrst two weeks of the
strike in the anthracite coal region are
as follows:.
Miners in wages 82,591,000
Operators in price of coal 5 Â»oÂ» 000
To unemployed, exclusive of strikers.. Wfo'oOO
Estimated depreciation in business in
the anthracite region 1,500,000
Loss in number of tons of coal un
w'ned 4i ... 250.000

thraeite coal strikers. They must Induce
the engineers and pumpmen to strike with
the firemen on June 2. They must also
induce the railroads to give them what
morefl aid they may, and they must stop
the mine at Bernice. where the only an
thracite coal in the region is now beinsr
produced. .
MILLIONS LOST BY STKIKE.
NEW YORK. May' 25.â Anthracite " coal
may be mined! with bayonets. This will
surely follow. any, interference, with the
plans of , the operators who propose' to
conduct, their- affairs in their, own way.
At the' first indication' of serious violence.
In the ianthracite coal' fields, the o'perators
will demand the protection of the. militia
and reopen the mines. This announce
ment has" /UeeiT ifiaSe" By" a fiftaHCIar dOti
â¢cera_clpseiy affiliated with the operators
and fully conversant with the 'situation
from the operators', point of view. None
of the operators who could be reached to
day would admit that this plan had been
agreed upon, but all declare â¢ that the
strike would be of short duration.' They
couple this prediction with a reiteration
of the assertion that the operators w6uld
make no concessions. It has become
"known that tlie operators never believed
that there was to be a strike until after
it had been actually declared. Their con
fidence that trouble would be avoided was
based upon the belief that John Mitchell
would protect Iheir interests. There will
be no Violence at the mines until the order
calling out the engineers and pump men
who are now preventing the mines from
Being flooded goes into effect on June 2
It is anticipated that the strikers will
then do their utmost to prevent the places
of these men from being tilled with non
union men and that trouble will follow.
Presidents of the coal carrying railroads
are telling their friends that there is no
cause for alarm and that the strike was
inevitable since the settlement in 1900.
The operators feel that if they had not
been coerced by the exigencies of politics
they would have administered a defeat to
the strikers that would have settled the
difficulty at least for years -

The items of charges do. not tally with
those of the lists of supplies driwri daily*
In some cases the cash charges are vast
ly in ekcess of the items df Supplies
drawn and vice versa. The iumble of
figures in the books of Commissary
Foley disclose a lack of system and
show that the accounts . have been de
liberately muddled in" order to hide up
certain transactions. Entries of. goods
and foodstuffs drawn for certain months
appear, under the headings of other
months. : Some 6f the entries for.requi
sitions end in the middle of a month and
no explanation could be secured from
Commissary Foley or Acting Warden
Aguirreasto the incomplete condition
of the^ records.
Taking* entries for the month of
March last as a sample, the question
arises as td what Warden Aguirre did
with enough foodstuffs to stock a large
grocery store. What has Aguirre done
with '50 rolls of butter averaging two
pounds to' a roll, and 81 dozen eggs in
one month? San Rafael is not far
from San Quentin Prison, and it may
not be surprising to the people of Cali
fornia to learn that perhaps an "annex"

, An old-school physician who has ad-
ministered the Fulton Compounds In three
cases of chronic Bright's Disease and Dia-
betes, with success In each case, met a
later case that he thought was too far
gone to reach. We now have a letter from
the doctor about this same case, from
-which we extract the following:
"You recollect when you were here last
I told you of a* lady, a Mrs. H , who
was suffering from chronic 'Bright's.' She
also had an ovarian tumor of long stand-
ing; also painful catarrh of the bladder.
I told her, as I told you, that I thought
it useless to try the Fulton Compound in
her case as she was certain to die in a few
months. : "Well. I finally put her on it. as
I knew of nothing else that would bo
likely to benefit her. v - I think this was
I about four months ago. Last Saturday I
called on her and found her greatly im-
proved, entirely free from pain in tlie
bladder." and on testing the urine found
only about 2 per cent of albumen and
specific gravity 1018. The first test showed
albumen 40 per cent and speciiS: gravity
1009. Were It not for the tumor she would
soon be a well woman."
We will show the original of the abova
letter to any reputable physician.
'Medical works agree that Bright's Dis-
ease and Diabetes are incurable, but 87
per - cent are positively recovering under
the Fulton : Compounds. (Dropsy. 'Bladder

The Compagne Generate Transatlantique
line steamship Versailles has arrived here
with 279 refugees; principally mechanics,
seamstresses and servants, who fled from
Martinique partly In fear of Mont Pelee
and partly because of the rabble, which
is pillaging that stricken island. The'ref
ugees say that the plunderers are tak
ing everything of value upon which they
can lay their hands and are setting fire
to buildings on farms and plantations.
In conversation with some of the ref
ugees I was toid that tho second erup

than was supposed. Boiling mud and red
.hot stones rained over the Basse Pomte
district, which was completely destroy

SYNDICATE PURCHASES
KANSAS WHEAT ELEVATORS
New Plan Is Started In Hope of
Eliminating Middlemen and
Speculators.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. May 25. â Walter
Vrooman of the "Western Co-operative
movement has closed contracts for the
purchase of six of the largest wheat ele
vators in the Kansas wheat belt and two
of the largest flouring mills. The prico
paid Is said to have been 1730,000. Vroo
man, who has left for New York to
complete the financial end of the plan,
say3 the present purchase Is but the be
ginning of a movement to center farmer3
of Kansas in a branch of the Vrooiaan
Co-operative Company. The farmers are
to be- taken, into the scheme upon the
payment of $100 each r for which they
are to receive the market value of their
wheat sold to v the company, and. In ad
dition, will receive one-half of the prof
it derived, the other half going to Co
operative stores, through which tha
wheat and flour will be handled. .
"The plan," said Vrooman. "Is to elim
inate wheat speculators and the middle
men. The farmers are in earnest sym
pathy with the movement. It Is the
only way to head off the talked-of flour
trust that is forming in New York."
It Js intended to ship to Great
Britain to be sold among- tie co-operative
members there, the surplus product be
ing disposed of In Kansas and Missouri.
J -Regarding relief work, some of the
refugees declared that the distress' was
much exaggerated, and that more provi
sions were being landed than the resi
dents knew what to do with. It was as
certained that laborers refused to work,
1 because | so much money and food had
come to the island that they did not
need to work any longer.

DISPATCHES from London report that an
unnamed member of the Ministry stated on
Saturday that the negotiations in South
Africa are practically settled and that the war is at an
end. It is explained that the delay ia closing the
negotiations is due to the difficulty of the Boer dele
gates in communicating with their followers, and the
desire of the British officials to give them ample time
to obtain^a ratification of their actions, so that when
the end comes there will be no reason for further dis
pute. It is therefore probable that some weeks may
elapse before the actual ratification of the peace
treaty, but none the- less the war is over arid King
Edward will have the satisfaction of knowing that his
empire is at peace on his coronation day.
PERSONAL MENTION.
PEACE IN SIGHT.
"Under the referendum clause in the
v charter the people can vote at the next
election on a proposition to make the li
cense tax any way from $200 to $600, and
I think the saloon men would be acting
in their own interests by agreeing to pay
$200 under an ordinance of the Board of
Supervisors."
"That proves," said the Chief yester
day, "that the $84 charged here is ab
surdly low, and no better argument could
be adduced for an Increase to $200, which
is less than in any other city In tha
State. I' can see no reason why the
Board of Supervisors should object to
pass an ordinance giving effect to my
suggestion, thereby enabling me to give
proper [ police protection to all parts j of
the city. It appears to me the only fea
sible way out of the difficulty.

The suggestion made by Chief Wittmart
and backed up by tie Police Commission
ers that the liquor license tax bo in
creased from $84 to $200 per annum so
as to secure sufficient revenue to prop
erly equip the police force has caused
much discussion among saloon-keepers
and the tax-payers generally.
The Chief has been in communica

WHY WITTMAN
URGES A HIGHER
TAX ON SALOONS
It is declared, however, that the prac
tically unanimous vote could be secured
for a rebate measure.
There is still a considerable element in
the .Senate opposed to tariff reduction,
a;id it is asserted by the beet sugar men
that the forty-five Republicans, neces
sary to pass the bill have not yet been
secured.
They count confidently on the early
adjournment of Congress after the ap
propriation bills are out of the way, and
they hope that If, after that time, there
Is an effort to pass the Cuban bill it will
be incumbent on the friends of the bills
to maintain a quorum in the Senate.
"It would be hardly fair." said a beet
sugar Republican Senator to-day, In dis
cussing the contingency mentioned, "to
expect the opponents of the proposed re
duction to assist In prolonging a session
in midsummer for the purpose of passing
a measure which they do not want to
see enacted into law."
Both these elements are now claiming a

The crops, upon which the business of San Fran
â¢ ; <co largely depend, continue to look well, and no
failures in any product of the soil are expected. Some
kinds of fruit will be shorter than anticipated, and
the same may be said of hay and grain; but taken as
a whole the harvest of the State will be large.
Conditions on this coast, subject as they are to
those in the Eastern and Western portions of the
country, show no particular changes. Like Wall
street, which has been tame enough of late, the San
Francisco market fo*- stocks, bonds and other se
curities has been inactive for several weeks, and, like
Chicago, this market for provisions and cereals is
without feature and quiet as a rule. Values for every
thing, however, comparatively high as they are, s<em
to be maintained without difficulty, and the domestic
and export trade of this port continues first rate.
There are no complaints from any quarter.though the
real estate men say that the demand for building sites
is not excited as for the past few months. Against
this report, however, the records show a number of
heavy transfers during the past few days, with the
usual announcements of large buildings going up all
over town. It must be remembered that real estate
Ii2s been abnormally active in this city for months,
*nd many handsome turns have been made, while
the tendency of values continues upward. As far as
that is concerned, whtn a town gets as large as San
Francisco it is a pretty safe proposition to buy real
"-tale almost anywhere ' within its limits, as most
-~>perty owners have learned to their profit and grat
'" -"lion during the past year.
Collections are reported good all over the country,
and the failures continue small and generally unim
portant, those last week numbering 192, against 180
for the corresponding week last year. The bank
clearings showed a loss front 1901 of 15.5 per cent,
the great cities of the country being about bal
anced in the matter of increases and decreases. For
the next two or three months, unless something un
toreseen happens, business will be more or less unin
teresting, as thjs summtr season is at hand, and there
never is much going on at that time of the year.
The other staples, however, are visibly quieter than
of late. The more favorable weather over the wheat
and corn belt and the promise of abundant crops of
both grains have taken the snap out of the markets,
and speculation in both has fallen to a low ebb. At
Chicago there is hardly anything doing, and while
the export movement from the United States is very
good, it is going along tamely and in a legitimate
way. Provisions, too, have subsided, and while
prices are abnormally high and the raw product in
more or less light supply, transactions at the princi
pal centers have materially diminished during the
past fortnight. Footwear is much quieter and sell
ers are making concessions here and there, in spite
of the fact that hides and leather have ruled firm,
with recent advances in the former. San Francisco
tanners, however, report -this market for leather
weak. The cotton and woolen trades are quiet and
featureless. .
LAST week was quiet in trade everywhere, and
there were few features worthy of especial
mention. One, however, deserves notice. This
is the strike of the coal miners, which a week ago
threatened to inflict serious injury upon business,
but which has happily been greatly modified by ad
justments here and there, so that at present it is not
such a serious menace and may turn out a trivial
matter after all. The railroads and iron trade, which
were especially threatened by the. strike, are doing
their usual business, and both interests report affairs
flourishing. The railroad earnings thus far in May
are ahead of those it the' corresponding time last
year, while the structural mills report liberal orders,
ivhich are running them to their full capacity, most
of them still being unable to promise prompt deliv
eries, and many being engaged for months ahead.
This protracted activity in iron and steel is remark
able. It has continued for several years and shows
no signs of slackening. As an indication of the con
dition of business throughout the country it is highly
gratifying. Â¦';â¢Â¦â¢
CONDITION OF. TRADE.
Three vacancies practically exist In the construction corps of
the United States navy. R. P. Hobson Is unfit for duty because
of impaired eyesight; J. T. McDonald is to be retired on ac
count of 111 health, and Lawrence Spear has resigned to enter
the employ of the Holland Submarine Boat Company. No
doubt the monotony of inspection duty at private" shipyards,
and routine duty at navy is not calculated to keep up the
interest of these comparatively young men; nor is the country
receiving an adequate return for the money expended upon the
education of these naval constructors. There is no naval power
having such an array of untried construction talent and there
is but slight prospect that any of our naval constructors will
have an opportunity to prove their proficiency. Under these
circumstances they can hardly be blamed for becoming tired
of a service that offers no encouragement to Individual efforts
and that they should retire or enter into the employ of private
yards.
Congressman E. G. Foss, chairman of the House Naval
Committee, made a curious statement the other day while
presenting the report on the naval appropriation. He alluded
to the fact that the Texas was designed by an Englishman
whom he met two years ago in Europe while visiting and
inspecting foreign shipyards. It Is true that the Texas plan.*
were designed _by an Englishman whose name was "William
John, but Mr. Foss failed to explain that the present chief
constructor, Francis Tiffany Bowles, then an assistant naval'
constructor, examined and endorsed the plans prior to their ac
ceptance by the United States Government, and that when hi9
attention was directed to certain defects in the design, which
subsequently proved to be serious, Mr. Bowles reiterated his
previous endorsement of the design and built a ship which
proved to be a failure. Mr. Foss' neglect to locate the re
sponsibility where it belonged was probably due to a reluctance
to expose the stubbornness and incompetency of the chief con
structor, but his alleged meeting with William John two year3
ago Is a highly Improbable event, for Mr. John died In Madrid,
December 19, 1890. *
That Germany is rapidly coming to the front as a naval
power is forcibly Indicated by the presence of a fleet in Irish
waters. The squadron, under the command of Prince Henry,
consists of eight battleships and three cruisers, and is larger
than the British Channel squadron or the French Northern,
equadron. There is a homogenity about the vessels com
prising this fleet which Is only equaled in the British navy.
The four battleships of first division are of the Kaiser
class, identical in all respects, size, maneuvring capacity, radius
of action, speed and gun power, and all of them are protected
by the same weight and distribution of armor. The fleet i3
practically new,- the oldest of the first division being only five
years old and the oldest of the others only ten years. In tha
second division there are some other slight differences, thÂ«
slowest ship being unable to make more than sixteen knots
against eighteen knots of the Kaiser. Taken as a whole the
German navy building is far more rational and systematic
than that of any other naval powfer, the squadrons of which
being as a rule composed of vessels with varying- speeds and
other qualities and therefore not as effective as a whole as
a squadron of ships identical in all particulars.

A first-class boy on the British training: ship Agincourt was
recently reported to the executive officer for having used ob
scene language and was ordered to receive twelve strokes with
the birch. Enraged at this the boy ran at the officer and
struck the latter a severe blow on the ear, after which a court
martial sentenced him to twenty-four strokes wijth the birch
and three months imprisonment. The corporal punishment
was carried out on the quarterdeck of Nelson's old flagship,
the Victory, where, according to old navy custom, the culprit
is stripped to the waist, lashed to a grating and receives his
castigation from a ship's corporal superintended by the mas
ter-at arms. The naval birch is similar to the ordinary besom
but is somewhat, smaller.. _ . _
'Five of Great Britain's armored ships have been transferred
from the effective service list to the D division, which includes
vessels fitted only for harbor service except in cases of great
emergency. The retired ships are the Glatton, built in 1S72; Iron
Duke, 1871; Neptune, 1878; Inflexible, 1881, and Swiftsure, 1872,
which latter is being converted Into a workshop. The total
first cost of these ships was $8,213,680 and $3,438,175 has been
expended upon them in repairs and . maintenance. * The Iron
Duke, which has been In active service on' foreign stations for
a longer period than any other armored shtp in the British
navy, was built at a cost of $1,043,815 and has consumed Jl 098 -
490 In repairs. The Inflexible, only twenty years old, cost $2*
659,230 and $689,060 in repairs, while the Neptune, with no ser
vice record whatever, cost $2,056,540 to build and $386105 In re
pairs. It is due to the persistent efforts of the British Navy
League to purge the navy list of obsolete vessels that the Ad
miralty has at last stricken ofE about a score. of ships from
'2ifi nrnhnhi * an l the savlnff m repairs on worthless craft
will probably cover the cost of a modern battleship every two
years. The Navy League has rendered a greater ser^icf to the
. The British battleship Russell has completed her series of
steam trials without a hitch and with highly satisfactory re
sults. The final test of eight hours under full power developed,
18,229 horsepower, 19.3 knots speed and a coal consumption of
2.09 pounds per unit of horsepower. The thirty hours' continu
ous run under four-fifths power, which is the severest test,
gave 13,695 horsepower, 17.95 knots speed and a coal consump
tion of 2.14 pounds. On April 18 a thirty hours' trial gave thÂ©
following results, with one-fifth power: 3768 horsepower, 12.1
knots speed, coal consumption 2.4 pounds. The ship was -2%
inches deeper in the water than her intended draught, dis
placing about 14,150 tons or an excess of 150 tons over her nor
mal displacement. The Russell is one of seven battleships iden
tical in all particulars and is 405 feet in length, 75 feet 6 inches
beam and carries a main battery of four 12-inch and twelve 6
inch guns. The hull and machinery were built under contract
by Palmer at Jarrow.
THE armored cruiser Francisco Ferruccio, recently
launched from the dockyard at Venice, is a sister ship
i to the Guiseppe Garibaldi built by Ansaldo at, Sentri Po
nente near Naples, and both are improvements on prior
types of which seven have been built during the past ten
years. The Francisco is of 7393 tons, 13,500 horsepower and
twenty knots speed and carries a battery of .one 10-inch, two
8-inch, fourteen 6-inch and eighteen smaller guns.
We' hope that Bishop Thoburn will so far reveal
his intimate knowledge of the supernatural purpose
as to kt us know how long we must keep it up, and
what it will cost and what the result will be. ;; ; -\
There is nothing irreverent in this spirit of in
quiry. Men want to know if -the. plan of creation is
so imperfect that all "this bloodshed and this killing
of the weak; by the strong are part of the divine
purpose to correct mistakes that omnipotence ought
not to make?
Bishop Thoburn avows his belief in the divine
fatherhood, and that is far beyond human fatherhood,
because it is omnipotent. By the unhappy accident
of prenatal influence, a human father may be
afflicted by a child that is vicious or idiotic. But
the races of men, according to theology, are created
and endowed with qualities, both moral and physical,
that were fitted to them before breath was put into
their ribs, or their ribs were made. A human being en
dowed with such power would choose to create man
in such form that it would be unnecessary to torture
and kill him to secure his belief in "any special form
of Teligion or his submission to any special kind of
civil government. That is what Bishop Thoburn
would do himself in the premises. Had he made
the tribes that dwell in the Philippines he would not
have so formed their minds and habits as to make it
necessary to create others to go there and kill them,
to burn their humble houses, lay waste their fields
and bring woe and havoc upon them. He is no
doubt too good a man to be responsible for such vast
and inconceivable human suffering. We do not be
lieve he would be that cruel to any of the lower
orders of life. Why then does he say that all these
things are being done by divine compulsion?
It is true that we read in Exodus that the heart of
Pharaoh was divinely hardened, but why may not
the hearts of men be softened in these higher and
better days? What great purpose is accomplished
by hardening the hearts of the Filipinos to their own
undoing? The Bishop admits that under the divine
compulsion we must go' on killing them, and Gen
eral MacArthur, a soldier, says that they are so in
capable of defense that it is like "killing children; and
he winced every time he had to do it. Complaint
goes up that the churches are quite empty on Sun-;
day. Is it because the view of the divine person and
purpose taken by Bishop Thoburn revolts human
ity and-the people refuse to believe in such a divin- ;
ity, and being told there is none other refuse to be
lieve in any? . V
If a human father find in his family one defective
child, who is mentally and morally weak, stubborn
and disobedient, he does not arm his perfect and
obedient children to smite that one .and wound and
torture and kill him, to force him to become as they
are. Such i thing woufd revolt the human ' heart.
The laws ma#e by man forbid.jt and their'swift'pun
ishment woufd follow such an exhibition of cruelty
and inhumanity. Now what is' the difference?
The views of the Bishop are very interesting, and
would be more so if any member of the committee
had examined him along the lines of his intimate
knowledge of the divine purpose. The unregenerate
mind is still found, unfortunately, and it will be
moved to inquire why an all-wise Creator brings into
existence whole races of people so imperfectly
equipped, morally , and mentally, that other and
stronger races have to be created to set upon them
with fire and sword to kill and wound and starve and
torture them into submission to the will of a Creator
who could have made them originally; so enlightened
that none of this cruel and inhuman punishment
would have been necessary.
He admitted that any Filipino who -favors Ameri
can rule is in danger of having his. throat cut^ which
reveals the fact that a majority of the people object
to our presence and hate our domination.
BISHOP THOBURN, whojias J>een on a mis
sionary station for many years in the Straits
Settlements, has been called -as. an expert wit
ness before the Philippine committee of the Senate'
His opinions seem to be derived entirely from a theo
logical view of our presence and responsibility in
those distant islands. He told the committee that we
are there be'eause of divine compulsion, and although
much bloodshed and .human suffering have been
caused by our going there, it is all a part of the
providential purpose.

According to Mr. Quincy and other promoters of
this public enterprise the conditions in Boston were
exceptionally favorable to its success. That it has
failed should induce great care in' entering upon like
ventures elsewhere.
The accountant's conclusion is: "Here is an.ex
periment in municipal ownership, a municipal in
dustry endowed with every advantage. Ample capi
tal, generous appropriations, plant in excellent physi
cal condition, regular work of the same general char
acter throughout the year, everything favorable for
a successful enterprise, which should do the city's
printing better than by contract, and which should
be able to pay as good or better wages, while giving
shorter hours to employes." The failure is declared
to be humiliating, and it is shown that the tax payers
will save money by abolishing the plant.
In addition to the waste, loss and high charges in
the printing department, the charge for ruling and
binding was found to be twenty per cent higher than
individuals pay, and there was extravagance in the
purchase of all stock used.
The expert printer concludes his report to the
Mayor by saying: . "The city is entitled to the same
returns from its expenditures that the individual ob
tains, arid this must be insisted on if the results shall
justify the expectations you expressed to me."
"The present hours of labor at the plant are eight
per day, with a Saturday half holiday, or forty-four
hours per week, against fifty-four hours per week by
the nine-hour day in outside printing establishments.
No one would object to this shortening of hours, on
the contrary all will applaud it, provided only that
the city's work be properly done in the forty-four
hours remaining. In fact, it is reasonable to expect
that more work should be done per hour per man
on a seven and one-third-hour day than on a nine
hour day, but this has not been the fact at the print
ing plant. The figures prove conclusively that, con
trary to reasonable expectation, less work per hour
per man has been accomplished at the printing plant.
These results have many causes, some of which are
designated in last year's report â but all of which
simmer down finally to two fundamental causes.
First, incompetent and sometimes useless employes,
who have been forced upon, or at least accepted by,
the superintendent; and secondly, that the necessary
vim and snap has not been imparted to the supervis
ion of the work. An unnecessary number of em
ployes has been carried in all divisions of the print
ing department. There isa lamentable lack of inter
est manifested in the work. In many cases the dis
position seemed to be to kill time, without reference
to the needs of the establishment. Hands were idle
for hours at a time.. This idleness is attributable to
the fact that the force is far in excess of the needs,
and were it a private corporation much of the help
would be temporarily laid off, or told to look else
where for employment."
The reason why this is a direct loss which increases
every year in spite of a higher charge, which would
itself be a satisfactory profit in a private establish
ment, is partly explained by the experts. They say:
The loss in five ' years' operation of the plant
amounts to $40,12883. This is the direct loss and
is increasing annually. For the first four years it was
$712944 per annum. The fifth year it was $061084,
This was the direct loss, the difference between outgo
and income. Added to this there is an indirect loss to
the taxpayers in the higher prices paid for the work
done. The experts found that on tabulation work
the price is twenty-five per cent and on plain work
ten per cent higher than in private establishments,
and in excess of the charge paid by the city when
its printing was done by contract. The amount of
this indirect loss is estimable only when the total
amount of city printing is known, and this informa
tion is not furnished by the report.
In discussing this subject we have heretofore re
ferred at length to the extensive socialistic experi
ments inaugurated in Boston by Mr. Josiah Quincy
during his service as Mayor* The chief of these was
a municipal printing office, in which he took great
interest and to which he pointed with pride. His
successor, Hon. Patrick Collins, has the same social
istic zeal, and with a view of promoting the policy
of public ownership ordered a comprehensive report
upon the operations of the printing office. The ma
terial for this report was gathered by two men, one
an expert printer and the other an accountant. Their
report is a sad disappointment to Mayor Collins and
the advocates of public ownership.
There are two schools amongst the advocates of
public ownership and operations of business enter
prises. One school 13 distinctly socialistic, the other
consults its prejudices rather than its philosophy. It
shares the feeling that is abroad against corporations,
and when shown that, as far as facts are revealed,
municipal waste is equal to or greater than corpor
ate profit, no impression is made because this school
of men seek revenge upon corporations and they are
willing to accomplish it though the method may im
pose upon the public greater burdens than those for
which corporations are responsible. The socialistic
school is calmly philosophical, and while it may be
as impervious to reason as the other because it re
fuses to consider both sides of the subject, its
optimism is more tolerable than the prejudice and
pessimism which are the motives of its associate cult.
THE revelations. of loss- and sometimes cor
ruption in the administration of light and water
supply by cities, under public ownership, have
i had a tendency to increase the demand for reform in
public accounting. Citizens who do not favor public
ownership and administration of public utilities are
found in the ranks of those who insist upon a better
system of public audit and accounts. As errors and
enormous -losses are discovered in the public opera
tion of light and water plants, the presumption is
not strained that equal losses occur in administering
ftie essential functions of government, such as fire,
police, school and street departments.
N EW FIGHTIN G CRAFT OF ITALY
IS AN IMPROVED ARMORED CRUISER
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
American interest in the situation is now centered
in the report that King Edward is willing to grant
liberal and generous terms to the conquered heroes.
It is said he has urged the Ministers to consent to
almost any- terms for the. sake of peace. It is to be
hoped these reports are true and that the new King
will show himself magnanimous as well as powerful.
Peace with magnanimity will adorn his coronation
better than all the splendor he can throw around it
though he ransack his empire for imperial adorn
ments. Even the coldest and least sentimental states^
man must see there can be no lasting peace in South
Africa unless it come with honor both to Briton arid
to Boer.
South Africa strongly intimated an assurance on the
part of 'the British Government that peace is at, hand.
A still more striking proof was; furnished in the re
port .of. the incidents connected with the recent
capture of 400 Boers.; It, appears that when attacked
the Boers niade no attempt to fight, but sought only
to escape. Thus there were no casualties on the side
of the British. That fact throws a strong light upon
the situation. It is evident the patriots of the Trans
vaal recognize that their cause is hopeless, and hav
ing made one of the most glorious struggles for
liberty in the history of the world they are now
facing defeat bravely and are averse to shed more,
blood merely for the sake of vengeance.

and caught the horse by the bridle and
succeeded in quieting him. His cries for
assistance were answered by L. Bianchi,
who undertook to drive the horse. As
soon as Bianchi was mounted in the seat
of the sulky the horse moved forward
with such suddenness as to dismount his
driver and precipitate him under the
teeth of the rake. Bianchi was dragged
for quite a distance, and an intervening
ditch in the road is all that saved him
from horrible' mutilation.

gree at the University of Michigan in 18g4.

SANTA ROSA. May 25.â While driving
along the Sebastopol road near this city
yesterday afternoon Mariano Lafranchi
sustained a broken leg. from the kick of
At Fresno where a stop was made at
the request of the Chamber of Commerce,
the party was received by the following
committee: John A. Neu, president of the
Chamber of Commerce; George M. Boles
Henry Avila, Taylor Albin, C. H. Rlege,
C. T. Cearley. A drive through the raisin
belt of East Fresno was enjoyed and a
visit was paid to the St. George vineyard.
The excursionists will start for San
Francisco to-night by the Santa Fe,
reaching the city, to-morrow morning.
Luncheon was served at the hotel,
where a wealth of flowers had been used
in decoration. At the close of luncheon
E. Barris, president of the Board of
Trade, delivered a short address, and A.
G. Towne and A. H. Vail made short
responses."
In the afternoon the visitors were taken
in carriages again and driven eastward,
the high Sierras towering always in front
of them, through the groves and vine
yards between Dinuba and Sultana and
on to Orosi, a distance of six miles. All
of this country is Included In the 130,000
acres of the Alta Irrigation District, one
of the few Wright law district that have
plenty of water, no litigation and pros
perity. The diversity of resources and
beauty of the orchards and vineyards
greatly impressed the excursionists.
The hosts drove back to Sultana. reach-
Ing It at 4 o'clock. A special Santa Fe
train was waiting to carry the party to
Fresno. Everybody said /good-by, the
man from Boston broke in with "Let me
ask you one more question," adieus werÂ«*
waved and Tulare County's whole-souled
entertainment of the excursionists was
at an end.
The Dinuba people turned out en masse
to welcome the visitors, and the local
band played its. most enlivening strains.
Carriages were waiting and a drive to
the newer country of vineyards and al
falfa fields to the west was taken before
noon. This drive extended four miles
west, two south and thence back to the
town. The old '76 ditch, now owned by
the Alta Irrigation District, was inspect
ed. Among those who drove the visit
ors about were W. B. Nichols, E. Barris,
H. Nordheim, Emil Seligman, W. P.
Boone/E. C. Dickey, H. D. Hagen, Harry
Hurst, editor of the Alta Advocate: F.
H. Wilson. Edward Miller, W. P. Fulton
and G. W. Osterhout.
The excursion left Porterville at 9
o'clock. The special car had been taste
fully decorated by the women of Porter
ville and boxes of oranges and grape
fruit stowed in it for the refreshment of
the departing guests. At Lindsay and at
Exeter the hosts of the day previous
were in waiting with other boxes of their
choicest citrus fruits.
The run to Dinuba was made In an
hour with but one disturbing incident. An
excited section foreman held up the
train, mistaking the special car for tha
pay car.
W. B. Nichols of Dinuba, who had been
with the party from the time of its ar
rival at Visalla, and at all points most
attentive to the comfort of the excur
sionists, became host In chief as his own
town was approached. Charles J. Carle
of Lindsay boarded the train at that
town and remained with the party until
the departure from Sultana in the after
noon.
FRESNO, May 25.â The deciduous fruit
region around Dinuba occupied the major
portion of the attention of the San Fran
cisco business men's excursion to Tulare
County to-day. The visitors were royally
entertained by the Dinuba people and
were given a drive of twenty miles
through orchards, vineyards and alfalfa
field, the wonderful productiveness of
which was evident to the most skeptically
inclined.

TULARE GIVES
GOODLY GREETING
Professor Walter Miller had been In the
faculty since the opening years of- the
President Jordan was equally reticent
In regard to the matter, saying that he
had nothing whatever to say that has
not been published.
PRESIDENT IS SILENT.
"Enough has been said for the present,"
he remarked, "and unless further state
ments are made by the other side I shall
decline to make public anything further,
as such publicity tends to Injure the uni
versity."
It is understood that the vacant places
will be filled by promotion and by secur
ing new men. Probably Professor Fair
clough, who was prominent in the pro
duction of the Greek play, "Antigone,"
will be given the chair of Latin to succeed
Professor Pease. Professor Pease when
interviewed this afternoon declined to
make any further statement in regard to
the resignation than was published in The
Call yesterday.
CAUSE OF RESIGNATION.
â¢ This action caused bitter feeling be
tween Professor Miller, who greatly op
posed and resented the action, and some
of the others, including Professor Pease.
So great was the enmity engendered that
Professor Pease and Professor Miller have
not spoken to each other for some time.
This dissension in the department was un
doubtedly the cause for the voluntary
resignation of Professor Miller and
apparently for the enforced resigna
tion of Professor Pease. Professor
Pease held the chair of the Latin depart
ment and Professor Murray, that of Greek,
Professor Miller having the title of pro
fessor of classical philology but not being,
of late, the head of a department.
"This resignation," said Dr. Jordan,
"while doubtless the outgrowth of friction
within the department was wholly volun
tary and at ms own instance." '~;
The personal relations existing between
President Jordan and Professor Miller, it
is believed, are and have been very ami
cable. The main cause of the resignation
seems to have originated at a meeting of
the professors of the three classical de
partments, Greek. Latin and classical
philology, held two years ago, at which
a majority of the professors decided on
the abolition of the department of classi
cal philology, of whicn Prpfessor Miller
was the head. , .
Professor Miller is at- present in Europe,
where he has spent the college year just
closing. His resignation has been In Dr.
Jordan's hands for over a year, but had
not been accepted previously. President
Jordan when seen to-day said that Pro
fessor Miller had presented his resigna
tion some time ago as an act, in his judg
ment, "desirable in the interests of the
university." .
the university, and his resigna
tion has been accepted by President
Jordan.

FLYCASTEBS SUCCEED â¢
IN MAKING LONG CASTS
The clambake and sports of the San
Francisco Yacht Club at Paradise Cove
yesterday were eminently successful.
Several of the yachtsmen cruised up on
Saturday night from Sausalito and made
a big bonnre, around which they sat,
telling etories and singing songs until 3
o'clock yesterday morning. More beats
went up to the cove yesterday, and prep
arations were made for a big clambake.
After the alfresco luncheon there were
eports of various kinds, aquatic and terra
iinna. The swimming race was won by
W. H. Young, and the tub race by W.
W. Haley, ln addition to these events
there were boxing contests, partnership
races and tugs of war under the direc
tion of Professor George Miehling of
t he Olympic . Club. A blindfold boxing
bout created much amusement, as did a
fat men's race, which was won by A. G.
A. Mueller.
It had been intended to line up the
crews of the various yachts on the beach
and that at a | given signal they should
pull oft to their yachts, hoist sail, weigh
anchor and race down to their moorings
at Sausalito.
This part of the programme was not
carried out, as before the time for start
ing arrived, a gale had sprung up so
that some of the yachts dragged their
anchors, and the yachtsmen had . their
hands fuIL The yawl Tramontana, which
Â¦was anchored off chore, dragged for a
considerable distance. On' getting her
anchor up she sailed, away under bare
poles. Then a stay sail was set, and.
later, a jigger and jib. On the return
trip she ran aground in "a cove opposite
the quarantine station on Angel Island
on a falling tide, and remained there till
the flood tide floated her off. Nearly all
the yachts went out under double-reefed
mainsails.
Among the vessels at anchor. in Para
dise Cove yesterday were the flagship
Thetis, the sloops Surprise, Challenger,
Cygnus, Rover; Halcyon, Amigo, Sappho;
the yawls Tramontana and Phyllis; the
schooner Chispa; the sloops Anita, Violet.
"Witch, and the launches Edwina and
Rob Roy of the San . Francisco ; Tacht
Club: the flagship Edna, the sloops
Speedwell, Freda, Aeolus, Truant, Mig
non, Presto and the yawl Seven Bells of
the Corinthian Yacht Club, and the sloop
Occident of the California Yacht Club.

Lynched. ' -"4.
FLORENCE. Colo.. May 25.â A riot oc
curred after a baseball game here this
afternoon which nearly resulted in the
lynching of a negro named Jason "Wilson.
After the game between the Colorado
Kuel and Iron team and the Florence
Eagies. "Wilson, who was driving in a
buggy, tried to pass every one on the
crowded road. He ran into the buggy
occupied by Onnie Carroll, a local gam
bler, and the wheels of the two vehicles
became locked. Angry words followed,
and the two men got out of their buggies
and began to fight. The crowd closed
around them and began beating and kick
ing the negro. A half-dozen olBcers res
cued Wilson, but they had to draw their
revolvers to stand off the crowd.

"William Garms. He is a veteran in the
use- of the rifle and the proud, owner of
many prize medals. The younger marks
men are fond of telling him he is a "has
been," but his 160-point bullseye yesterday
gave him the opportunity to say some
thing-, and * he 'did' not neglect' the chance.

Each club has played one tie game.
CAL EWING and his Oakland re
cruits spent the Sabbath Mn their
usual manner yesterday by wiri
ning both baseball games. They
closed the series by copping four
games from the carpetbaggers, losing one
and tying that famous nineteen-inning
affair. . . : . - .
- Nearly S000 lovers of the national pas
time visited the Eighth street : lot and
divided themselves into two rooting fac
tions. They kept kidding old Pete Loh-.
man and Pete actually took it all good
naturedly/ Brick Devereaux paraded on
the side lines and kept the crowd feeling
good by his quaint and original aritlca
throughout the game. Scoresâ Morning
9 to 6: afternoon, 3 to L Â¦ ' '
The afternoon contest was a great
pitchers' battle between ' Thomas and :
Cristall. Both pitched masterly ball.
Cristall came out on top, notwithstanding
he gave six bases on balls. The Spnators
never could hit him and he was .backed
up by that brilliant infleld, which gob
bled up everything that happened to roll
around. : : Â¦ .

Morning Game.
LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES, May . 25.â Los Angeles
took both games to-day, the morning
game requiring an extra inning, besides
creating a great deal â¢: of excitement
among the- players as well as ; the spec
tators. The tenth inning began with the
score 2 'to; 2. Hanlon lined out. a safe
hit over second, base and Jones followed
with a short grounder to Nordyke who
threw to McNichols.' He failed to hold
it and both Â¦. Hanlon and Jones were safe.
Toman struck out. . Hannivan sent" a
grounder to Holly, who fumbled; ; allow
ing Hanlon to. reach third. Jones started
for second base but changed his mind or
I became rattled and returned to first. The
ball was thrown to second and O'Connell
called, both Jones and Hannivan, the lat
ter having reached first, out. In the
meantime, ; Hanlon scored. O'Cpnnell's
decision, if allowed to stand, 1 would have
made three out and no runs. Immediately
the Los. Angeles players and ? Manager
Morley rushed on the field, followed by
the crowd from the bleachers. For a
time matters looked squally for O'Con
nell. Three policemen protected him un
til the crowd had : cooled down and left
the field. The game was declared won by
Los Angeles. 'It appears to have been a
case of rattles or mistaken judgment on
the part of 'O'Connell.. v~
'â¢ The afternoon game was " all fWaddell's
He made a home run - and two two-bag
gerg besides doing some startling fielding
in left field. Slagle kept the \ hits scat

Owing to* the strong wind and the wave
of cold -weather which swept . over. Ingle
slde yesterday: the attendance at the reg
ular monthly shoot of the Golden Gate
Gun Club was exceptionally light. " There
were but eight entries in the club, event.
Accurate shooting was rendered practical
ly Impossible by the wind, which blew, the
birds in the most unexpected directions.
Nauman, who. won* first money in the club
shoot, was the- '.only '...one to make a
straight score in that event. In shooting
up a back score Otto Feudner also made
fifteen without a miss. In the club con
test Feudner, "Slade". and Murdock all
made fourteeii and divided second, third
and fourth money. Murdock and Feudner
did not miss, but their birds, unfortunate
ly, fell dead out of ; bounds. After tbÂ«
club contest three : six-bird pools were
shot. The scores made in the club shoot,
which was a flf teen-bird, race, ..were as

"Let us waste no time in needless intro
duction or preface. Within these sacred
walls Starr King spoke these words while
he served his God during four years of the
Civil war." In this manner the Hon. D.
K. McKinlay opened his address to the
congregation. "Let me do likewise," he
continued, "and get to the matter in
hand." He then reminded them of the
reason for these memorial services; he
spoke of the brave men who had fought
and died for a great principle and what
a priceless blessing the American republic
had received by these sacrifices. It was
good to think that the church set aside
one day in the year for memorial ser
vices, so that the people might pay their
devotions at the shrine of the heroes who
had died. He told them how the Puritans
themselves but lately free from the op
pressor had been the first to plant the
seÂ«Â»ds of slavery.

The buoyant tone in nearly all the de

Perhaps the most eloquent form praise of

LONDON, May 26.â The deep impor

expressions, ' published in the London
press, of regret at the death of Lord
Pauncefote, the British Embassador at

of his career In the United States. The
papers .this morning 1 vie with one an

value of Lord .Pauncefote's work to -the
empire in the difficult position which,
the Daily Chronicle reminds its readers,
Is now the most exacting In the diplo

the time when Lord Stratford de Red
cliffe described the Washington legation
as "very pleasant socially, but not re

The Chronicle says:
'Lady Pauncefote to-day signified her
approval of the arrangements tentatively
made yesterday by which services are to

With the work of building the Pacific cable
under way with a -private company of un
doubted integrity and responsibility back of it,
it seems U> me that the proposition for the
Go\ernment to expend $10,000,000 or. $20,000,000
In this enterprise is unworthy of consideration.
I do not belie've the Government should em
bark in any enterprise which can legitimately
be carried on by private individuals. John w.
Mackay, the head of this company, is held in
the hizhest esteem in California, both as a.
business man and as a citizen. I have abso
lute confidence In his word and that he will
do whatever he agrees to do. -
Representative Woods of California
said:
Â¦ I have been for years anxious for a cable
acrofs the Pacific. ' I â¢ introduced the Corliss
bill, confident of its passage through both
bouses. I had an impression that the only
way to set a Pacific cable was to have the
Government build it. The fact has developed
that a perfectly capable private company has
decided to build, a cable without any Govern
ment aid and has begun the work. This com
pany, the Commercial Pacific Cable, has of
fered to build th^ cable upon its own respon
sibility with its own money, and at its own
risk, and as a fact is . now proceeding very
rapidly with the work. The Senate Naval Af
fairs Committee, to whom this bill was re
ferred, took uÂ» the question and found that
this was the situation. I then asked that my
bill be indefinitely laid aside and the committee
assented to this by a unanimous vote. If the
Government should either now or hereafter de
sire to own a cable across the Pacific the only
reasonable thine for the Government ' to do ia
to let this company build the cable and then
bay it. /

Faulkner was a fireman on the South
ern Pacific up to a couple of years ago,
when he lost his position through gam
bling and the consequent garnishment of
his pay check. Since that time there
had been an estrangement between
Faulkner and his wife. Recently she be
gan arrangements to sue for a divorce.
Faulkner heard of her intended action,
and made the remark that if his wife
did not come back to live with him sne
would never live with any other man,'
but-no attention was paid to the threat.
To-day as Mrs. Faulicner was crossing
the track to call on a neighbor, wheeling
their ten-month-old baby in a carriage,
che was met by Faulkner. They had a
short conversation, but of what import
is not known. The first intimation of
trouble was when Faulkner struck his
wife. She grabbed the baby out of the
carriage, and as she did so Faulkner
pulled a revolver and commenced shoot
ing. The first shot went wild, but the
second struck Mrs. Faulkner in the up
p^r part of her right arm and shattered
the bone. The third shot entered her
hip and ranged downward, while a fourth
bullet entered near the small of the beck,
and, ranging upward, passed through her.
heart. He then turned the revolver upon
himself and fired a bullet into his right
temple, dying almost instantly. The face
of the baby was powder burned, but oth
erwise the -child was not injured.
OGDEJf, Utah, May 23.â Ren Faulkner.

To-morrow night Enclna Hall will bÂ«
the scene of the senior ball. Owing to
the fact that Manager Lathrop refuses to
allow the hall to be used for dancing
after 12 o'clock the committee has been
obliged to have the dance begin at 6
o'clock in the afternoon.
The annual anniversary meeting of the
University Christian Association was held
in the chapel to-night.' The meeting was
particularly well attended. The Rev. C.
R. Brown of Oakland spoke on "The
Message of Religion to the Men of To
day."
"Finally, let us dwell upon the structure
of that fourth pillar, which completes the
'star' of Emerson, in the essential ele
ment of Reverence. The age is not a rev
erent one; it cannot be until reverence Is
nursed In the conservatory of the home.
Parental restraint Is scoffed at by chil
dren barely in their' teens. Where the first
lessons of reverence are not home lessons
the spirit of reverence will likely pass
from home to school, to college and to
church."
"Taking the third pillar that supports
the temple of true Christian character, it
will be found in the doctrine of Annihila
tionâself-annihilation in service. The suc
cess which has attended you in your uni
versity career has been in. proportion as
j'ou have lost yourself in your subject.
Now as you go forth into the fulfillment
of your life purpose, just as you experi
erce this process of self-annihilation,
even so will your life work prosper.
FIRST LESSONS OF REVERENCE.
"Passing from the first letter of 'star'
ia the ideals of sanctification, we shall
consider the second pillar in the qualities
included in the spirit of Thoroughness.
Search where you will, there is not a
page in history that pictures such a thor
ough life as that which the gospels de
pict in the life of the son of God. No
where is the lesson of duty taught with
euch sublime force. This is an age of in
tenseness, -of unremitting struggle, in
which we almost idolize that quality
known as 'the strenuous life.' And who
knows It better than those who between
the ages of 20 and 30 are learning that the
only*genius Is the genius of hard work;
who toil on with ambitious flame to make
a mark for themselves in the world? I
ara confident that I stand this day before
hundreds of such lives who would hail
the encomiums of the professor, 'There
goes a thorough student,' with that just
pride that takes possession of the British
soldier's heart as he clasps the Victoria
cross. To you who go out from these
walls to make your record the burning
words of the great, strong thinker, Rob
ertson, when dying, 'It is finished,' must
come home with special force. To dig
deep down to the bedrock of your better
life, to build a strong foundation of a
Christlike faith, to erect a temple of life's
tasks in your profession as a citizen, as
a Christian gentleman and gentlewoman,
to do It well, to do it thoroughly.
LESSON OF DUTY.
"This method of viewing the foundation
of true character is a libel against Chris
tianity. A holy man is a wholesome man.
Sanctiflcation is good health. It enters
the very holy of holies of a man's being.
It involves a self-controlâ that royal
thing without which there can be no real
strength; the capacity to say 'I will' by
the grace of God when there is need of
a strong negation.
"When that great mind of New Eng
land, Emerson, urged the cultivation of
lofty aims his well-known counsel clinched
his conception of the true ideal in the
words, 'Hitch your wagon to a star.' I
take that word 'star,' and with the hope
of aiding the memory, what each letter
of the word stands forâ sanctiflcation.
There is not perhaps a word In the whole
range of theology more misunderstood
and misquoted than the word 'sanctify.'
It would appear that the responsibility
for its misuse rests quite as much upon
the Christian as upon the non-Christian
world. I will venture to say that if I were
to point to a student crossing the campus
and say to an average companion, 'Yon
der is a saint,* that average companion
would intuitively picture a man separated
from his fellows, dressed in the uniform
of holiness and the possessor of a certain
spirit that would characterize the man in
the temple of old. 'God, I thank thee that
I am not as other men are.'
THE TRUE IDEAL.
"The reputation of this great university
is not made by the strength of her fac
ulty. Each and every one of you who
goes forth from her walls to take up life's
task, t<* do the duty that lies next to you,
to do it honorably and faithfully, to take
your place in the national life and to en
ter upon the rights of your citizenship â
upon you will rest the great responsibllity
of maintaining the name of your alma
mater. Nor can this be done by mere
cleverness, for behind mental ability
there must shine the light of a strong,
true, pure character. A clever man may
not be a good man, even as a good man
may not be a clever man; but goodness is
ever first in order. Therefore it is that
to complete an education a man must
know where he stands relatively as be
tween the life that now is and the more
abundant life beyond; or, if you prefer to
make it so, between the*natural life now
and that higher spiritual life which is
yours by the truth of birth and by the
birth of truth.

Polly was at least 25 years old. How
much older than that she may have been
is purely a matter of conjecture, as she
talked of everything but : her own age.
Ever since Mrs. Oelrichs was a child she
had Polly for a pet. The parrot was one
oi the members of the Fair household in
San Francisco. She traveled on the spe
cial car Cupid in which Mr. and Mrs.
Oelrichs made their bridal tour across
the continent. ' â¢
. Sorrow served the' household to-day
when it was known that Polly had drawn
her last difficult breath and had winked
her eye in vain at the grim fowler. The
bird had preed her feathers and had tried
in vain to rise to her feet. Her plumage
had lost its luster and her eyes were
devoid of that familiar sparkle, yet she
made a brave effort. -
, Arrangements for the funeral of Polly
are now almost complete, although it is
too early at present to give the full de
tails. . With plumage composed, with the
eyelids closed and tlie^ beak,- firmly com
pressed, Polly now lies in state. A box
carefully prepared will receive the form
and to-morrow morning it Is expected
that ornithological retainer of the houses
of Pair and Oelrichs will be conveyed' to
the Rhode Island watering place. The
interment will be on Mrs. . Oelrichs' es
tate. "'

UNION, S. C, May 25.â Six persons
were killed and several were injured by
a tornado that swept this section of the
State this afternoon.
Dead:
Miss Sallie'Hart of Union.
Miss Annie Lawson of Union.
Mrs. Maxey Sims of Union.
Vera Sims'.' :, Â¦
Miss JLawson, killed at Jonesville.
One person, unknown, at Pacdlet.
Injured: Maxey Sims, broken fingers;
Lee Sims, internally injured; William
Mabrey, fractured shoulder and bruised;
Mrs. Mabrey, bruised; two children of
Mrs. Mabrey, slightly injured.
Two storms, one from the north and an
other from the southwest, met near here
with terrific force. The storm was pre
ceded by a heavy, rain. One wing of the
tornado passed along Main street and
blew in several store fronts, doing much
damage to stocks. . : â¢ â¢
Knitting Mill Hill,~ south of the town,
felt the full force of the tornado, which
blew down the school house and two resi
dences, converting them, literally into
kindling wood. The occupants ran from,
one of the houses just before it went to
pieces and took refuge in another near
.by, but this house was also crushed to
splinters. In this house Sallie Hart and
Annie Lawson were instantly killed, Mrs. N
Maxey Sims died in an hour and her little
daughter, Vera, died soon afterward.
Maxey Sims escaped with broken fingers.
Lee Sims received several cuts on the
head from falling timbers and was in
ternally injured. Mr. Mabrey sustained
a fractured shoulder and his legs were
badly burned by a stove falling on him.
Mrs. Lee Siiris received a bad but. not
fatal cut on the head. Mrs. Mabrey's two
children escaped with slight injuries. It
took some time to .get the- victims from
the debris. Every physician in town was
called Â«and they were assisted by the cit
izens in relieving the sufferers as much
as possible.
Jonesville reports that : the storm
wrought much damage there and that a
Miss Lawson was killed.

At the bridge Witherup's feet were tied
by the brother of the murdered man and
the senior Grow adjusted the rope about
his neck and pushed him oft the structure.
Witherup's neck was broken by the fall.
Its wcrk done, the mob left the body
hanging and dispersed quickly and quiet
ly. Coroner Johnson cut down the body
this morning.
Wltherup, at the bridge, made a full
confession. He said the killing, which
took place about four weeks ago, was the
result of a quarrel over a piece of land
that the two men were farming together.
Witherup attacked Grow one night as he
lay in bed, splitting his head open with a
hatchet. He then hauled, the body to the
Salt River and dumped 'it in. Witherup
vfes 55 years old and Grow. only 21.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 25.â Jesse
Johnson, a negro, who murdered M. D.
McCray, postmaster at Rensaller, Rails
County, Mo., on April 28. and who was
taken to the Paris jail on May 2 to pre
vent his being lynched, was brought here
to-night for safety. Johnson was placed
in the jail at New London, Mo., after
the murder. A mob stormed the jail on
the same*night, intent on lynching him,
but the officers had anticipated the act
and removed him to Paris. During the
excitement at Paris last night he was
placed on the train for Kansas City.
Whitecotton was swept aside and in a
few minutes Wltherup was secured. The
murderer made no resistance and in reply
to questions confessed his guilt. The
father and brother of the victim, were in
the mob and assisted In escorting the
murderer to the bridge a quarter of a
mile away.
The mob then quickly reappeared, sur
rounded the jail again and with sledge
hammers battered" down the big iron
doors. This was the work of but a few
minutes. James H. "Whitecotton, State
Representative, rushed into the jail as
soon as the doors gave way and made a
stirring appeal to the avengers to desist
and allow the law to take its course. The
leaders wavered for a minute and became
quiet and probably wo'uld have spared the
prisoner's life but for the frenzied cries
for vengeance set up by those in the rear.
The mob remained in front of the jail
for nearly two hours, parleying with the
officers, and finally marching away. The
officers remained on guard, but believed
that the mob had disbanded. About 2
o'clock several men approached and en
gaged the Sheriff and his deputies in con
versation. -Then, suddenly, before the
officers could defend themselves, they
were seized, disarmed and carried away.
The mob went at once to the jail, but
was held back for more than an hour by
Sheriff James W. Clark and Deputies
Martin Clark and Polk Masterson, who
stood before the entrance to the jail stock
ade with drawn revolvers and threatened
to shoot the first man who attempted to
force an entrance.
PARIS, Mo., May 23.â Abe Wltherup, a
white man, theÂ» murderer of William
Grow, was taken from the . Paris jail at
2 o'clock this morning, marched to the
bridge on the north edge of the town
and hanged by a mob of more than 100
men, who rode quietly into 'Â¦ town at mid
night. '
The Nelll company presented "A Bach

Martha Morton, at the California Theater
last night.
This play is a favorite one with the San
Francisco public and the story of David
Holmes, the young man grown prema
turely old and brought out of his retire

by Silvia, his young ward; the fear that
he has learned life's lesson too late and
iiis struggle within himself to do right
and give up his new-found treasure into
the hands of the man he thinks she loves,
is beautifully and faithfully portrayed by
James Xeill.
The performance throughout was a good
one end too much praise cannot be given
to Mary Elizabeth Forbes, whose Sylvia
was a very true and dainty piece of act
ing. Miss Edythe Chapman was good in
I 1 :.* somewhat unsatisfactory part of Hel-
Le Grand. Jchn TV. Burton, as Mar
tin Beggs. the confidential man of David
Holmes, was excellent, and the rest of the
parts were in good hands.
There was a large house, which encored
unstintingly.
Dooley and Fowley have a clever black
race sketch and earn the applause which
they get. Little Klsie Imitates Cissy Lof
tus to perfection and acts the tough in a
\.ay which keeps the house in convul
sions. The two little Pucks do their turn
in a charming manner, and Sager llldg
ley and Gertie Carlisle have something
entirely new for this week.
lx,tta Gladstone scores her usual suc
cess in her quaint interpretation of the
country girl, and her popularity seems to
be on the increase. Stuart Barnes at once
jumps into favor with his original songs
and funny stories. He has some sayings
that are entirely new and original. The
i^icchiar.i troupe is a good holdover and
never fails to interest the audience with
its high grade acrobatic performances.
The cleverest bill the Orpheum manage
ment has given to the public in many
months was presented last night to that
contingent of enthusiasts who are always
ttmpted by a choice vaudeville bill. It Is
a laugh-creating show this week, and
those who enjoy jokes get their money's
worth.
The star attraction is Peter F. Dalley
and his company In "A Dress Rehearsal."
It is a most clever farce, and Dalley is
better than ever, which Is saying a great
deal for the popular comedian. 'me xarce

BODY TAKEN TO CHAPEL.
Dr. Leavitt followed with a short
prayer, and then the flowers that covered
the head of the casket were removed so
that the friends might have a last look
on the face cf the man they honored
by their presence. A long line was
formed, and for t?n minutes people pass
ed, viewing the calm face of the dead.
Dr. Leavitt read the funeral service
cf the Unitarian church, and then intro
duced Edward J. Livernash, who delivered
the eulogy. The speaker was greatly af
fected by the death of his friend, and
lie spoke from the heart. His words were
words of sorrow, and the language that
flowed from his trembling lips denoted
th-j grief under which he was laboring.
Mr. Livernash's tribute to the memory
of William De Mott Dressier was a sin
cere one. He tcld of the qualities pos
sessed by the deceased, of his kindness
of heart and sincertiy of purpose. He
dwelt on the good he had done in the
community by his forceful writings and
of his modesty. He expressed the great
sorrow all felt at his untimely taking
off and of the loss sustained bj,- the com
munity. In closing his eulogy Mr. Liv
ernash's eyes were dimmed with tears,
and as he uttered the words "Good by â
good by, 'Jake,' old man,"' there was
hardly a dry eye in the gathering.
The funeral of William De Mott Dress
ier, the well-known journalist, who died
last Friday morning, took place yester
day. Friends of the deceased gathered
round the steps of the chapel at Odd
Fellows' Cemetery, where the ser
vices were held, and with uncovered heads
listened to the reading of the Scriptures
by Rev. Bradford Leavitt, pastor of the
First Unitarian Church.
The ceremonies were simple but im
pressive. In the gathering that sur
rounded the caske: were men in all
walks of life. Judges, city officials, phy
sicians, lawyers, newspaper men and
friends of the deceased were present to
pay a last tribute of respect to the dead,
tiorrow was depicted on the faces of
those who stood by the bier, for they
all loved the man who was taken from
tfceir midst.
Tne stairs of the chapel were covered
with magnificent floral tributes from his
fellow workers and friends. A vacant
chair, with the words "City Editor,"
Â¦was a tribute from friends. Other
handsome floral pieces attested to the
esteem in which "he was held by those
who knew him intimately.
DELIVERS ELOQUENT EULOGY.
Preceding Mills' lecture Mr?. Emllv
Conklin Lucey sang several songs appro
priate to the occasion.
In its social aspect*, the Chrijstlan gospel. If
practically applied, could scarcely be Improved.
It teaches men not only to love their neighbors,
but to love them even better than .themselves.
It says that if all men are children of God
they are true brothers, one of another. "Chris
tianity is the religion of love made easy." It
gives also a great conception of the world and
the position of humanity, in it. It doeÂ» not
really teach, as has sometimes been proclaim
ed In its name, that the chief object of man
is to escape from a ruined and sinking: wreck,
nor even to save the wreck, as tome have
taught, but rather that it is our duty to help
the world on to a practical justice. The pas
sion that was manifested In the great crusades
and afterwards by the building of the magnif
icent cathedrals of Europe, needs to-day to be
intelligently applied to the organization Of hu
man society. If this cannot be done in the
name of Christianity, then Christianity . will
perish from the earth and a new â¢ and better
form of religious expression will take its place.
To ray that greater men are yet to Come Is
"not to detract from the majestic character of
Christ, but to affirm the omnipotence of God."
The religion of brotherly love will outlast any
name that now we know, and be perfected In
a new hÂ«aven and a new earth wherein will
dwell justice. ...
Christianity srives to the world to-day a grreat
conception of man and his relation to God and
to his fellow men. It regards him as God's
child, but loving unworthily like the prodigal,
and says to him. "Return unto God and he will
return unto you." It says that God is spirit,
that the true man also must be Epirlt, and that
theenre of all his defects will be manifested
if he joins himself in the closest communion
to God. . Â¦ .
Jesus had this personal conception of a
righteous God in whom righteousness was iden
tical with love. He carried the old prophetic
conception to its limit, until God became to him
a father and nothing: else. For him the way
to know God was through love. It was a nat
ural thins that Paul, meditating on the life
and death of Jesus, should have seen him as a
perfect illustration "i this and announced him
as the incarnation of love, and the complete
revelation of God and should have satisfied his
legal mind by attemtping to show how God
could be righteous and yet forgive the wicked.
So he said. God himself bears the punishment
for man's sin. Poetically this was true, and
the Idea of love pouring out its life at. the de
mand of Justice for the service of humanity
can never fail in some form to exist In a world
that believes in a loving God. Much 6o~called
infidelity is simply the demand that God shall
be recognized as love and nothing- but love.
1 Benjamin Fay Mills delivered a lecture
last night in Golden Gate -Hall on "The
Transient and Permanent in Christian
ity." His subject was divided into the
origin of Christianity, its history, its doc
trines and what remains of value for the
present and the future. He said that lit
tle reliable history concerning the origin
of Christianity existed, but that there
was a great mass of tradition enveloping
it, and that one of the most significant
facts about its growth was that it never
gained any victories in the land where it
had its birth.
Regarding the teachings of Jesus and
Paul and the true aims of Christianity
Mills said:

When we are offering the smartest shoes of our 1902 styles for
the lowest of sale prices, does this fact not merit your attention to-
day? â¢
If you have read our advertising of the last few days you are
aware that we are about to move into the Sorosis Shoe Parlors on
Post street.
Though our shoes are the most popular in the city for wear and
fashion; though they are the keenest styles of this summerâ yet we

Therefore we are conducting a sale that has never beenparal- i
leled in Americaâ the circumstances that force us to sell like this are i
so unusual.
If you want shoes for this summer's vacation â for any time this
year â you will never have an opportunity such as exists here to-day.. /
\ We can fit you with the best shoes on the market at the lowest
prices in the world. Do you need shoes?
