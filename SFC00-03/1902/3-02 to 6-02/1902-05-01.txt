Indications that the beef trust < is at
tempting to conciliate the Government is
found . In tlie statement made public to
day by Commissary General "Weston of
the army, who says that, beef Is being
offered at rates lower than those of last
Republicans of the "Ways and Means
Committee have practically agreed to
take no steps in the agitation against the
beef trust. Bills placing meats and poul
try on the free list have been introduced
and referred to the committee, but these
bills will never reach the House.*
The Richardson resolution providing
for an investigation of the present rise in
prices will pfobably be tabled.
Chairman Payne of the "Ways and
Means Committee is of the opinion that
nothing should be done by the House
Â¦while -the investigation begun under thÂ©
direction of the Attorney General is under
way. In this he Is .said to have unani

EATING MOSE FISH.
CHICAGO, April 30.â While the butcher
is complaining he is up against hard times
and forced to cringe under the lash of
the beef trust, which wants all- the profits
of the meat trade, the fish man is selling
more fish than^ever before In the history
of the trade. â¢ This is the condition of af
fairs in that section of the northern coun
try between Portland, Me., and Salt Lake
City. The prices '. of . fish were" never so
low. The great demand is attributed . to
the advance In the price . of meat. Said
a prominent dealer to-day:
"I have just returned from the East,
and ' never Â¦ was fish so cheap" as to-day.
AU '.the dealers and every branch hpusÂ»
we have report 'the sales surpass all rec
ords In" the -history, of the trade. '. Every
where in the northern country there . i3
an immense demand for fish, and we can
only, attribute it to the fact that the pub
he has' switched from meat to fish.Thero
are no Indications that, there will be any
increase in- the prices of fish, so It may
be ' thaÂ£__butchers will have to turn fish

were prevented from : Jumping from the
building, notwithstanding that there was
not assign of fire. The panic-was Â«w in
When the firemen and policemen arrived
every effort was made to guard the girls.
The firemen rushed up the stairway and
begged the girls to be calm, telling them
there was no danger, but the sight of the
firemen seemed only to add to their terror.
While the policemen and firemen were en
deavoring to quiet the Â«irla ladders were
being run up on the outside of the build-
Ing, and the employes who had climbed
out on the fire escapes and window ledges
were enabled to check the crush on the
stairway; and then began the work of
rescuing those who had been trampled
upon between the second and third floors.
The alarm for ambulances had been
turned in and as quick as . the dead and
injured could be carried from the building
they were hurried to the hospitals. The
number. of ambulances was entirely In
adequate and patrol wagons were brought
into U3eto carry the -victims away for
treatment. hMMAbh

ST. LOUIS, April 30.â M. A. Low, gen
eral attorney of the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific Railroad, stated td-day that
his road had purchased the St. Louis,
Kansas City and Colorado Railroad, oper
ating between St. Louis and Union, Mo.,
and had authorized the Mercantile Trust
Company to negotiate for the purchase of
the Wiggins ferry stock at $300 a share. :-
With the purchase of the St. Louis;
Kansas City and Colorado Railroad the
Rock Island secures the right of -way into
St. Louis and with the acquisition of the
property of the Wiggins Ferry Company
ample terminal facilities will be had. Â»
Low declined to state the price paid for
the Colorado road. He said the Mercan
tile Trust Company had secured ' an op
tion on a majority of the stock of the
Wiggins . Ferry Company, the purchase
prloe of which would be more than $5.
000,000. Â¦Â¦Â¦';Â¦> : Â¦' -
Low advanced the opinion that the Rock
Island would probably expend millions of
dollars for improvements. The heaviest
holders of Colorado Railroad stock were
David R. Franci3 and John Scullin, presi
dent of the Wiggins Company. The road
has only built to Union, Mo;,' but is be
ing- extended to Kansas Ctty. where. v It
will meet the Rock Island. There were
no changes to-day in the contest between
the Mississippi and Mercantile trust com
panies over the Wiggins ferrv stock.
Both sides still hold firmly that the con
trolling interest has not passed. "Â¦Â¦
TOPEKA, Kans., April 30.â A. A. Robin

expressed himself to-night as follows re
fardmg the Rock Island purchase of the
t. Louis, Kansas City and Southern:
"1- will give the Rock Island a very
good line and will make It of Increased
importance as a connection of the Mex

El Paso is proving to be a great benefit
for the Mexican Central. With the St.

A. A. Macurda, president of the San
Francisco Sunday-school Association,
opened the exercises of the second session
of the California State Sunday-school
Association convention yesterday morning
in the lecture room of the First Congre
gational Church with a song and praise
service. The delegates had a busy day,
over thirteen hours being spent In dis
posing of the programme.
Rev. J. H. Goodell of Oakland gave an
interesting exposition of ' Bible study,
which was closely listened to by .the dele
gates. ' He was followed by Charles D.
Meigs of Indianapolis in an address on
"How to Teach With Chalk and by Ob
ject Lessons." A blackboard was used,
to Illustrate the lecture and the speaker
drew pictures illustrating, his text, en
livening his discourse with a number of
well-rounded and taking stories.
The remainder of the morning session
was consumed in listening to the reports
of the officers. The report of the execu
tive committee dealing with matters cf
detail was presented by the chairman,
Rev. L. 11. Walters, of Fresno.
Earl S.Blngham, the. general secretary,
followed. He said in part:
We have as an association settled down to- a
steady work that augurs Â¦ Â¦'. well I for sUccests.
County and district of fleers ' realize that Â¦ suc
cess does not result from one or two conven

tell. I believe that the State association has
also come to the same conclusion. We; do
more and better work to keep the county and
district associations â¢ constantly moving- on

us to have all of our forty-nine counties or
ganized, it Is better for us in present financial
and new conditions r to have - our thirty-two
county associations and â¢ their forty-seven dis
trict associations as strong as they are than -to
have this . same amount of i strength Â¦ scattered
through forty-nine counties. The time is not

all our counties', but that we . have not been
able to do so ' up to . this ' time is no cause
for us to think we are not doing a great work
as an association Â¦ or that .we have acted un
wisely la not extending our organization over

President, Oakland--Dear Sirs: ' I -accept with

to my. party and myself to visit Oakland as
guests of. the Board of-Trade. - -,=â¢Â¦ v - - v :
,.I .shall,, ,'howe.ver,. have, 'to ask your indulg
ence. as to.n.amins the date.'.. This I will. give
you a little later on when my plans' are more
fully matured. -Tours truly. . - .' Â¦ â¢-. .
' ' s . ': -â¢ :->' " e. h; harriman.
and we all know that you have developed here
the most perfect man-of-war that ever was put
afloat. (Applause.) I Bay that it is your work
%i-hich has made it necessary for us to go hand
in hand with you in order to conduct the traffic
Â¦vrhich you are producing. I am making a very
much longer speech than I ever thought I
would. (Applause.) There are some matters
which I would like to touch upon that perhaps
Â¦will not occur to you in these times of pros
perity. But you know that â I do, anyhow,
whether you do or not â there do come waves
of depression (laughter), and. then. is the time
when we get caught. Then we have the kicker
and the fellow that has got something to carry.
Then is when the adverse legislation comes.
Then is when they think that the railroad ought
to stand it all. Now Â« are willing to stand
our chare, and I hope that what we are stat
ing now will help to bring about some euch
reeling that we can go on hand in hand when
those times come. (Applause.) .
Now, when we are speaking of legislation,
you know that there is some effort being ex
erted for new legislation at Washington. I
do not think that any person should absorb
all the knowledge on that subject, but I will
say this for the railroads which I happen to be
charged with the responsibility of operating,
or directing the operation of, that we do not
Â¦want pooling. We believe that it acts adversely
to the point pooled and to all other points in >
the country where similar conditions exist. But
Â¦what we do want is more right to agree among
ourselves. We want the right to combine on
something in order that we may Berve your In
terests the better. I mean by that to say that
we can eliminate from the situation much of
the unnecessary service that is being performed,
so that when the improvements are made which
I have been telling you about the traffic, or the
most of it, can be allowed to go upon natural
channels and to be directed In such way by the
various railroads through their connections (to
use an expression which you have often beard)
upon the lines of least resistance, that is the
most economical. We cannot prevent the high
grade, crooked lines taking some of the cars.,
but we could do it for less money if we were
allowed to direct that traffic on the most eno
nomical lines and do something to protect what ;
we call the improvident lines, and It is to your
Interest, and I believe you will see it before
this next generation goes by; and I believe
finally the legislation will be ln favor of per
mitting railroads to move on some such line
as that they can conduct the traffic in the most
intelligent manner. We have gotten, I believe,
in the present methods to the limit of the
course of conducting the traffic, and we must
be helped by you and other business Interests
through the country to Improve on that.
TERMINAL FACILITIES.
There is another question which Mr. McNear
drew to my mind â I don't remember exactly
whether it was he or not â somebody, any way â
and that is the matter of facilities â local facili
ties. I might say terminal facilities. When
these improvements of the lines are finished,
and they will be finished only with the work
which I have explained to you which has been
begun this yean but will have to be continued
for several years, and will extend much further
than the matters which I have been talking
about, es we have got to eet a hole through
the Sierra Nevadas. and I don't know Just
where we will go through. But that will be
Improvement of the eastern end of the line to
dispose of some of the Eastern traffic which
we hope to bring this way. , We will have to
have additional terminal faculties. We will
have to have them here. We are now about
to apply for some rights in San Francisco to
take care of the lines we are improving south
of here and the coast line, and you know some
thing about the bay shore, and we do not want
to be delayed. Every day that delays us from
getting some other terminal improvements
pending that is lost. We do not want to resort
to questionable methods in order to obtain those
facilities. We want to be open and "above board
and have the public help us to help themselves.
(Applause.) There are some other things I
would like to talk about. (Cries of "Go
ahead.")
Anybody can run a railroad or everybody
thinks anybody can run a railroad. I have no
doubt there are Beveral young men here that
could do it. But you will gain by having us
placed, because otherwise we might be mis
mar.a.t-ir.pr something else.
In closing- I would like to say that we are
Â¦working sincerely and from no theory or motive
other than to improve the properties and to
make them more effective and keep them so
that they will be able to transact all the busi
ness given them. I speak now for the whole
Southern Pacific organization, and grasp the
hand of welcome that you have extended to
us to-night.
MAYOR EXTENDS WELCOME.
After the. demonstration of approval of
Mr. Harriman* s speech had subsided, the
toastmaster introduced Mayor Schmitz,
who spoke as follows:
I do not speak as the representative of any
particular class, but representing the entire
people, I desire to extend to the guest of the
evening a- cordial welcome to" San Francisco.
I wish to say that we hope that the visit of
Mr. Harriman and the gentlemen who are
with him will result in great benefit to the
corporation he represents and to the city and
to the State of California. Little more than
half a century ago instead of the city where
we are now banqueting there was to be seen
Â¦here only a desert, a stretch of sand dunes.
Now it is a city second to none in the world in
its possibilities. The commerce of the East and
the Indies flows; through our gates. We want
capital here and we want to do nothing to drive
it away. But capital cannot do everything.
V> must depend upon the individual, and I
ho^e the day is not for distant when capital
nr.o labor will walk hand in hand. I do not
think there Is a city on earth where the citi
zens, compelled to go through such an indus
trial disturbance as the last strike, would en
dure Its annoyances and show such a manly
admirable spirit.

of sand may generate -friction and seriously; in
terfere-with the smooth and successful opera

disagreements generate social friction even
more injurious to a railroad's prosperity and

the Judicious use of social lubricants should
engage quite as much ' or even more of the

elimination of the other kind. -To accomplish

The new spirit In California'.'- life, may well
be illustrated by ' the character of this ban
quet,-and by-theâ variety-^- and extent of this
assemblage, 'gathered to welcome the head of
our greatest corporation. ..'. ...
California- hospitality*' in pioneer times has
passed. into :a ; proverb." r , It has been said that
whereas other peoples^had .the latch string out
for the stranger, Â¦< the pioneers built their houses
with open doorways so- that strangers might
enter without knocking. More than olden time:
hospitality beams about these tables, and . Is
represented in .this welcome.. to-night. I There
Is a destruction of ancient prejudices. The era
of good ; feeling abroad ln the land- includes
the great railroad and offers to it .the . oppor
tunity to make of public opinion Its most valu
able corporate asset. ' In this room there are
now met to. extend the hand of good fellow
ship-yto the new president of the, railroad, that
Is California's chief artery- of commerce, those
who have been the railroad's- friends and its
foes, and for once you cannot tell them apart.
"â¢Â¦ When we speak of the new industrial move
ment and New California, far \ be I it from us
to Intend reflection on olden days.- No- other
State has such fascinating and romantics his
tory. The traditions of our early life were
unique and should be forever treasured ln the
memories of- men. California passed through
three distinct periods/ of romance.
â¢ First, the coming-of .the. padres, whose foot
prints in their .spiritual journeyings sanctified
the soil. Next the settlement of the Spanish
dons, who . measured â¢ land Â¦ by the league and
not by the acre,- whosec cattle roamed on a
thousand hills and whose life" was patriarchal.
Then the period of gold, 'when the discoveries
of almost fabulous' wealth- dazzled the world,
and gathered here . the best of every race to
contest for the prizes of the earth, : Â¦ Â¦ <
After those times came an epoch npt'so sat
isfactory or so -pleasant. A time not rich in
poetry, adventure or achievement. Remote
ness from the large activities of the world pro
duced some of the faults of an Insular people.
Things small to a large world were large to
our- small world, and a lack of union and-con
centrated . effort prevailed among men. .
>I have sometimes- thought: that this period
found its characterization in the figure and
motto on the great seal of California. A
woman seated by the Golden Gate. The motto,
"Eureka! I have found it!" California was
seated by the Golden Gate looking, for a com
merce that did not come. The face of^the
woman growing sad with weariness, like.the
faces of the wives of Kingsley's three fishers,
who waited and watched for what never-came.
THE NEW CALIFORNIA.''"
But we have escaped from â¢ those conditions.
We are in and with the New California to
night. A California through whose veins In
dustrial energy { is. coursing - and throbbing.
Where a united people, led by wise and patri
otic commercial bodies of this city and State,
are reaching for a foremost position in popula
tion, commerce and wealth, and wherrÂ» Jabor
and capital are cementing ln friendship; whÂ«re
a thrifty and happy Immigration is attaching
itself to a fertile, soil; where a people never
before so blended is wooing fortune, not by
words or prayers, . but by aggressive efforts.
Nature created here great beauty. Moun
tain, valley and sea and vegetation combine to
make a spectacle not elsewhere seen. When
God made here a second Eden he intended it
should be the home of a greater and nobler
Adam. Beautiful as is" the picture of California
rising from the ooean to the Sierra's crown,
the picture is not complete. Against this ma
jestic background must stand a figure of a
great and powerful American, a Californlan
representing industry, success and moral
grandeur. It is this figure, replete with great
ness, that our commercial bodies and our two
great universities in friendly rivalry are en
gaged in placing there. .
The spirit that is here to-night Is not typi
fied by the figure of the seated woman by the
Golden Gate. ' Nor is it expressed in â¢ the
motto, "I have found it;" But rather in the
motto, "I will do- it; I will make- it." The
figure to be emblematic of the new life "should
be of heroic size, erect and in action',' with
one arm extended for the commerce of the sea
and the other, extended for the commerce of
the land. â¢ For under the new impulse', Â¦ with
energy acd intelligence applied to opportunity
the unbounded resources or this State, com
bined witn her more than 700 miles of 3 sea
board,-must shortly insure this commonwealth
the domination of. the commerce of the' land
westward from the Mississippi and. the com
merce of the Pacific Ocean to its uttermost
shore. Â¦ â¢ . -. ...
INTERESTS. ARE MUTUAL.
The chairman called upon A. Sbarboro,
who spoke as follows: - - ' â¢ Â¦'â¢:-. 4.
Â¦ On behalf of the members of the- Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association of California
I tender -Mr. Harriman a hearty welcome -to
.San Francisco. ' 'â¢ .
Our association, Mr." Harriman, has had. the
good fortune of entertaining at the festal board
your predecessors, C. P.; Huntington and
Charles H. Hays, together with the efficient
officers of the Southern Pacific Company : ' i
These social gatherings have had -the effect,
I am pleased to say, to smooth over several lit
tle misunderstandings, and have brought forth
that harmony and good feeling between the
business people and the , railroad company
which is so essential for the prosperity 6t our
city and State. We have no doubt, that this
auspicious occasion will also conduce to' the
continued . good : feeling now existing between
the railroad companies and their patrons'. This
is a consummation devoutly to be ' wishe'd be
cause, as you. well know, Mr. Harriman, the
manufacturer," the producer and the merchant
are silent but very, efficient partners of, the
railroad companies, and therefore our interests
are mutual. :â¢'.Â¦â¢
Much has been said of late years about rail-
The locomotive of a few years ago* was a
pygmy compared with the giant machine of
the present day. The latest additions to freight
motive power have been christened "battle
ehips." One of 'these modern machines with
tender carrying; 6000 gallons of water, or ae
much as a tank car; and ten or twelve tons
of coal, or -half a carload, weighs complete,
ready for the- road, 'about'" 160 tons, carries

Julius Kruttschnitt was introduced by
President Newhall and in sp*- ing of- the
evolution in the workings o* -ne railways
of the United States and the still more
vast accomplishments . to be attained by
the industry, said: ;
CAPACITY OF ENGINES.
This State needs the railway- and the
way needs the State. - There Is nothing gained
by fighting. The great waste comes from fail
ure to co-operate. Let us not for a moment
conceive that we gain when there Is a fight
going on between the people ana the railroads.
The people are ready now to co-qperate, are
ready to putt with those who pull, hot to kick
with those who k.lck. The . motto ' for us is, to
Join with those who are trying to do something,
the lesson of the helping hand.
Because the railroads have not been for
mally adopted and administered by the State
it does not follow .that they have no public,
responsibilities. The public highways have
been adopted by the State, but It does not fol
low that the railroads should be so adopted and
administered. Railway science is in its in
fancy. It. requires the highest ingenuity. The
railway is not yet ripe for the steady, routine
that of necessity goes with State administra
tion. But it possesses a quasi-public character
that demands responsibility and is worthy of
public guarantees. It is fitting to-night to say
these things, because the deeds of our guest
have shown that he subscribes to this doctrine.
We know that 'on all the roads which he has
administered the heaviest steel rails have been
laid, curves have been cut out, trains run on |
schedule time. He has been ready to answer ;
to public demand, aye. to spur public demand
on.
SCIENCE OF RAILWAYS.
With the opportunities that come to the head
of a great railway corporation come the re
sponsibilities Of Its relations to the people. A
rallrcad creates society by rearranging human
beings. It creates wealth by rearranging the
objects of nature.
I am always glad to come over whenever
there is a banquet to a new president of the
Southern Pacific .- 1 feel kindly toward Dr. Jor
dan because he is always pleased to come over
to Berkeley when we inaugurate a new presi
dent. We presidents have a fellow feeling and
I am ready to admit that after the university
of California the Southern' Pacific is the most
important corporation in California. Â¦ â¢
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California followed, s ' He
said in part: - : . '
Mr. Carnegie told me a while ago that the
foundation of his fortune lay in this: That
while other men were -employing men who
worked by rule of thumb he employed chemists
who knew most about the processes of the
manufacture of steel, and by this means he
was able to effect savings that led to his great
success. Such men as Mr. Carnegie recognize
that instead of hiring chemists they must make
them. In other words, they must furnish facil
ities for scientific investigation. It is this that
accounts for the absurd fad, as it may seem to
seme, of patronizing scientific research, of
founding universities. It is this that explains
the crowning act of the career of Cecil Rhodes,
in some respects a gigantic success and in
others a gigantic failure. ; .
President David- Starr Jordan of Stan
ford spoke of Mr. Harriman' s interest in
scientific research. Continuing, -e said:
PRESIDENT JORDAN SPEAKS.
'. From the thoroughness with which you seem
to be inspecting your 'properties and ' acquaint
ing yourself with i the existing : conditions on
this coast we feel sure -bt good results and mu
tual benefits, and 'I am certain that the mer
chants and the citizens in general will be" with
you in your efforts to develop our resources.
With the passing of the original builders the
roads, too, have passed. to new. owners not new
Californians. Mr. Harriman, we - congratulate
you upon having succeeded to and acquired so
valuable a property. The merchants of San
Francisco now desire a close and intimate re
lationship with you and hope you will be. at
least, half Calif ornian and be good to ua. Â¦
Since it has been our good fortune to discover
that California has an abundance of cheap me
chanical power stored in. -her oil fields and
mountain streams we believe that the products
of our Pacific islands and of the Orient should
enter the United States through the Golden
Gate, be here prepared for the consumers and
by your system of railroads distributed to them
throughout the centers of great population in
stead of going to the Atlantic seaboard and
there manufactured for distribution. Give us
a ' rate of transportation I to the Middle West

The Oakland grounds are a little faster
than they were, but still there is room
for improvement. It is nearly Impossible
to get a scratch hit or beat a bunt on
them. - Â¦ - â¢ â¢ .
Lawler was the only player to steal a
base in yesterday's fracas. He accom
plished this after a throw from a long
fly to left field. .." * ; .
Pete Lohman watched the players from
the grand stand and took care to observe
the fine points of the players. Pete sporc
ed a Panama hat and looked his best.
Holly made a beautiful stop of Ray
mer's drive in the second, but the modest
Angel beat the throw to "first.
Rube Waddell ignores the regulation
mitt at first and uses instead a plain
fielder's glove.
Waddell will pitch for Los Angeles this
afternoon and Glendon may oppose him.

The weather .was cold and chilly and
the game lacked the vim which makes
the fans arise from their seats to orate
on the respective merits of the favorites.
The only time any cheering was turned
loose occurred when the mighty Rube
Waddell fanned the air on two different
occasions. Rube did several funny stunts,
but they \ were offset when he biffed
the air. Rube, however, took his medicine
as a matter of course and passed out the
high sign to the crowd, a sort of mys
terious message which 'conveyed the idea
that the big southpaw, had something to
spring in the future. .
The Angels made : their only ' impression
on the score board In the second inning.
Raymer hit. passed short stop and Reilly
sacrificed him tq the second landing.
Great things were expected of. "Waddell.
but he fanned the atmosphere three times.
Anderson hit to left territory and Ray
mer was there with Los Angeles' only
point! Â¦ . â¢' Â¦ .
The Ponies did a fast turn In -inning
four when Lawler tripped the cushions on
a walk, a sacrifice, a stolen base and. a
hit by Shugart. ' The final run-earning
was done in the eighth round. Meredith
accepted a. free ride to first and Roach
missed McHale's high bunt. Bone forced
Meredith at third, but McHale got home
on Lawler's drive to center. Bone soon
followed on Nordyke's well-placed single
in the vicinity of the score board.
Both Meredith and Jones twirled In ad
mirable style, but- the local southpaw had
the better of the argument. The score:
The score tells a different tale. Three
Ponies finished in the money, while a
lonely Angel managed to drag himself as
far as the home station. * t
The northern debut of Jim Morley's nine
ball tossers was not what the Los An
geles public prophesied. The inhabitants
of the southern ,city said mean things
about the Ponies and insinuated the
Angels would make Harris* tribe look as
though they came from A second-hand

Ever since, the development of northern
trade Vancouver has been at a disadvan
tage as compared with Seattle during the
winter season by reason of the fact that
Canadian vessels could not afford to make
closely connected runs, as, through freight
traffic to the Canadian Yukon amounted
to practically nothing ' and ' passengers
were few. On the other hand the Amer
ican vessels running north from the
Sound had the freight and passenger
trade of the | Alaskan coast portfe to . fall
back upon during the off season arid that
. traffic has been sufficiently great to . pay
for the operation of the various vessels.

the Canadian Pacific Railway. Company
has operated the line^at an annual loss
approximating $100,000, exclusive \ of the

occasioned by the lack of continuity of

pears that the. groom sought a little re

after another and imbibing generously at
each. The bride resented this early dis
position to disregard the restraints of the
marriage state by starting out after the
wayward husband. She overtook him and
tugged at his arm, imploring him to re
turn home, but, it is charged, he struck
her. Quite a crowd collected to watch
the outcome of the meeting, but proceed
ings were cut short by the arrival of a
policeman, who arrested them both

the total to be 32.623, as against 29.2S2. the
return for the Federal census of 1900, a
gain of 334L There has always been a
feeling that the Federal census was not
complete, as many families declared that
no census taker called on them, and the
present census would seem to confirm that
belief.
STOCKTON. April 30.â The second an
nual census of San Joaquin County, taken
by the Chamber of Commerce, was com
pleted to-day. So far as the returns have
come in from the country districts re
markable gains are shown, but the outside
districts will not be complete for several
days. In the city of Stockton, from which
returns are complete, superficial inspec
tion of the summaries shows a gain of
803 over the census of 1900 in the city
proper. Still larger gains are shown in
the suburbs and the population of the
city and its three chief suburbs will
amount to over 21,000. The enumeration
completed to-day gives 18,309 population

TACOMA, April 30.â Leaving Nome on
January 10, Judge Wickersham and Guide
Louis Lane made an important and in
teresting trip of scientific research to Es
kimo tribes living at Cape Prince of
Wales. For twenty years Judge Wicker
sham has been an authority regarding the
customs and habits of Pacific coast abor
igines. Previous research had convinced
him that the North American Indians
are descendants of Mongolians who were
wafted across the Pacific Ocean in junks
or other small craft by ocean currents.
His trip to Cape Prince of Wales en
abled him to obtain additional facts tend
ing to prove the reliability of this theory.
For nearly a month he lived among the
Eskimos, a close observer of their cus
toms, while he investigated their legends.
Appreciating the importance of his of
ficial position, the Eskimos devoted them
selves to his entertainment. They loaded
him down with curios, some of which are
rare and will be sent to the Smithsonian
Institution. At Cape Prince of Wales he
could look across Bering Straits and see
land in Asia. He ventured out to the
edge of the solid ice, three miles from
shore. Judge Wickersham suggests that
a biograph picture showing the ice floes
moved northward by ocean currents
would make a most interesting eight,
though lacking the awe-inspiring sound
of the ice pack grinding against the solid
ice.

Deputy District A ttor=
ney Favors the In=
novation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA. April 30.â The trial of a
liquor case by a jury of women is llke.y
to be the novelty witnessed here in two
weeks. Deputy District Attorney Fred
ericks favors the plan and has found no
obstacle in the way. He says he certainly
shall call for a jury of women unless some
good legal objection can be raised.
This move is not one of choice so much
as one of actual necessity, as a case just
concluded by Fredericks shows. For the
last four days, until yesterday, he was
in Monrovia looking after the prosecution
of Mra. Dora Thomas, charged with sell
ing liquor without a license. It was Mrs.
Thomas* second hearing, she having been
arraigned I in Azusa recently, when the
prosecuting witness failed to appear.
Three days out of the four consumed by
the second case were spent in trying to
get a jury- The prosecution challenged
all of the known club and saloon advo
cates or sympathizers in the panels and
the defense challenged all of the known
temperance people. It. only required two
hours to hear the case after the jury was
once sworn. The jury, having been out
more than twenty-four hours, reported
that it had disagreed and was dismissed.
In two weeks the case of Mrs.
Thomas' husband, also charged with sell
ing liquor without a license, will come up
here. Fredericks has been "racking his
brain to determine where he shall find
enough men to compose a jury. The
names of nearly all the men in the town
ship have already appeared in the venires
exhausted. . -
"What's the matter with the women?"
was the happy thought that struck the
Deputy District Attorney, as he pondered
over the question. And he mentally an
swered: "They're all right."
Then he looked up the law on the sub- Â¦
Ject. Section 198 of article 2 of the Code
of Civil Procedure states that jurors shall
be citizens of the United States, twenty
one years of age, residents of the State
for one year and of the county for ninety
days, in possession of their natural facul
ties, of ordinary intelligence and not de
crepit, possessed of sufficient knowledge
of the English language and assessed on
the last assessment roll on property be
longing to them or as a member of a
partnership whose property is so assessed.
As there are any number of women who
hold property in their own right and
others who have their husbands' property
in their names, there will be no difficulty
in gathering: a feminine jury, unless the
defense can prove that women generally
would not give a saloon-keeper half the
chance that the law allows.

. WAR CLOUD LOOMS UP.
In view of the. fact that there are sev
leral presidential candidates in the field,
the suggestion that certain members of

barred for having been chosen illegally Is
creating discussion among the .women.
â¢>â¢ The thought; that a question of legality
might come up in this regard had not oc
curred to most of those who are here to
represent the various States, and the lo
cal club women have given the subject
little attention. Arrangements had been

BONES ON UNION ISLAND
THOSE OF A SEA ANIMAL
Scientist Says Skeleton Unearthed by
. , : ; - Japaaesa May Be That--of ......
a Whale.
STOCKTON, April 30.â The party, in
cluding Professor Osmont vt the Univer
sity of California, returned this evening
from the place where the immense bone3
were lately uncovered on Union Island.
Professor Osmont says the bones are not
those of a mammoth or mastodon. . but
that the skeleton is that ; of a whale or
some other large sea animal. A thorough
examination of the removed bones . and
the place where they were found was
made and as soon as the water can be
pumped out of the excavation the re
mainder of the bones will be dug up and
removed to the university.
RICH GOLD FIND STARTS
STAMPEDE FROM TONOPAH
Indian Leads White Prospectors to
Beds of Ore at Lone
Mountain.
VIRGINIA. Nev., April -30.â A special
dispatch received to-day fully confirms
reports that a great gold find has been
made at Lone Mountain, thirty miles
west of Tonopah. The ore body is forty
feet wide and is said to average $100 to the
ton. The discovery was made by an In
dian, who took white prospectors to the
scene. There is a big rush from Tonopah
and Sodaville.
The recent strike in the Fraction shaft
at Tonopah increases in richness. Vast
ore beds are exposed.- The new discov
eries make the district a world beater.
FIESTA IS UNDER WAY.
Streets of Los Angeles brilliantly
Illuminated at Night.
Official decorations are completed and
to-night the fiesta flags, already furled in
place, were cut loose.
LOS ANGELES. April 30.â With the ap
proach of darkness this evening 1 the elec
tric illuminations were turned on and the
Fie3ta may be said to have opened. The
principal . downtown streetsâ Main, Spring
and ' Broadwayâ were to-night lighted by
thousands of vari-colored electric bulbs,
fashioned into fanciful designs, while
flags and bunting decorated every window
and doorway. The city was crowded with
visitors and the spirit of the Fiesta per
vaded the atmosphere. The only thing
worrying the Los Angeles people is the
likelihood of rain before morning, which
would spoil the decorations and make it
generally disagreeable for the visitors.
The sky is heavily overcast and a brisk
wind blows from the east, foreboding
showers, as already predicted by the lo
cal forecast official.
The main three streets of the city are
strung with lights on both sides as far as
Seventh street. Wires strung from pole
to pole bear red, white and blue incan
descent lights, while each pole is . sur
mounted by a cluster of colored lights

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
STRENGTH
Is an attribute of manhood universally
desired. Few people understand that the
only source of physical strength is food,
and that every one who has sufficient
nourishing food should be strong But
there are thousands of puny people who
have plenty of good food.; Howis that
>^**jK ' explained? The
i^S*Â»Â£?NÂ»!i^ explanation is
yS|35gjg^'\. simple. Food

Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
cures diseases of the stomach and its al-
lied organs. It causes the perfect diges-
tion and assimilation of food and thus it
makes men and women strong.
"I had been suffering from indigestion so
badly that I could not work more than half the
. time, but now can work every day and eat any-
thing I want." writes Mr. Victor t>. Hayden.'of
Blaekstone. Nottoway Co.. Va. Â« Why ? Because
I took Dr. R. V. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov-
ery. It has put new life and energy in me, re-
stored my health and made a man of me once
more. I used to 'weigh 170 but had gotten down
to 144, now am back to 160 and will soon be back
*t my_ old weight if nothing happens. Your
medicine has done it all"

The residents of the Ocean Beach dis
trict filed a petition with the board ask
ing that school quarters . be rented be
tween the Cliff House and the Ocean
House to accommodate some fifty-two
pupils, many of whom live three miles
from the nearest schoolhouse.
The trial of Miss Mary McKinney on
charges of alleged incompetency was laid,
over for one week. The application of
Truant Officer Floyd that he be allowed
an assistant was taken under advisement.
Leaves of absence were granted to Mrs.
M. Nellis, Miss R. C. Gallagher, Miss S.
M. "Wilson and Miss J. Leszynsky.
.The board instructed principals by cir
cular to post a notice that any pupil who
cuts or defaces a schoolhouse is liabla to
suspension or expulsion, and that tho
parents are liable for the damages. Prin
cipals will also advise teachers to occa
sionally lecture their classes on moral
education and manners, and to read to
them the school regulations.
The Merchants' Association urged the.
board in a communication not to con
struct a twelve-class schoolhouse at the
corner of Flood avenue and Edna street,
for the reason that the location is at the
extreme end of the district and the ma
jority of residents live at the other ex
tremity. The association suggests that a
six or eight- class schoolhouse be built
east of the power house, and another six
class school somewhere In the neighbor
hood, of the proposed site. J .. m "'.
Dr. Robertson notified tho board that
James B. Sykes, a teacher In the depart
ment, had settled his bill which threat
ened to cause the latter some trouble for
violating a rule.
Superintendent Webster protested
against the board imposing a fine of $Â»
upon one of his deputies, L. A. Jordan;
for neglecting to file a monthly report
submitted by Principal Bush of the Poly
technic School. - On Webster's showing:
the board decided that it had no power
to fine school deputies and Jordan's de
mand was ordered to be made out for the
full amount.
The Board of Education met yesterday
aod adopted a resolution remitting tha
fines imposed on teachers for tardiness
during the late street, car strike.
âMiss Mary Denis, a teacher in tha
Spring Valley School, tendered her resig
nation, which was accepted. She will be
married shortly.
Superintendent Webster was instructed
to ask that different arrangements bÂ©
made for the unloading of prisoners at
the new police station on Fourth and
Clara streets. Webster stated that under
the plan now proposed an objectionable
sight will be presented to ' the pupils of
the Whittier, School, which adjoins the
station. Â¦ C_ Â¦â¢â¢

decorations consisted entirely of Easter

EXCURSION
A Day Among the
Redwoods.
Santa Cruz Mountains.
A pleasant day's outing in the Santa
Cruz Mountains has been arranged for
Saturday, May 3. A personally conducted
excursion will leave the ferry (narrow
gauge) at 7:45 a. m., the train stopping at
the principal camping resorts on the
mountain sides, including Glenwood. Fel
ton, Ben Lomond and Boulder Creek,
calling for them on their return In the
evening. This will enable all who make
the trip to determine where to spend their
summer vacation. The low rate, $1 25
round trip, injures a large party, but ar
rangements have teen made for well
equipped cars to take care of all who go,
and there will be no crowding. Tickets
are on sale at the Southern Pacific ticket
offices in San Francisco, Oakland and Ala
meda.
"Will Give Blossom Fete.
The "blossom fete." which was post
poned from last Thursday on account of
the streetcar strike, will be given this
afternoon and evening at the residence of
Mr. and Mrs. Wesley A. Jacobs, 1713 Pa
cific avenue. The bouse will be entirely
decorated with blossoms and a musical
programme will be rendered, including
numbers by Miss Tooley, Mrs. Cramer,
Mrs. Thayer, Miss Macomber, Mr. Robson
and a number of others. The fete is for
the benefit of the training school of the
"Woman's Home Missionary, Society. ' , .
Harry Knox, a member of the executive
committee of the Carmen's "Union, sent a
letter to President Holland of the United
Railroads yesterday thanking him and
the directors in behalf of the union for
their kindness and courtesy shown to the
committee during, the strike. He Inti
mated that the employes were heartily
pleased with the new order of things and
that they would do all in their power to
preserve the entente cordiale existing be
tween the rnmimnv and its employes.
The yellow signs which adorned Vin
ing's office have been removed. These in
formed applicants for positions .that the
rate for becoming employes of the road
was $50. This has been reduced one-half.
This is rot the only benefit the strike has
conferred upon would-be employes. Not
only has the rate been cut in half, but
the conditions under, which employment
may now be secured are infinitely better
than in the past.
Vining was disappointed throughout
the strike when the directors failed to
consult him with reference to the affairs
of the road, and his management prac
tically ceased on the day the strike be
gan. Its success completed his discom
fiture and the result was his resignation
some days earlier than was expected.
Vining is one of the ablest railroad men
in the country. His technical knowledge
of the business is wonderful, but, to use
the expression of one of the directors of
the company, "He does not know how
to handle men. If he did. the strike
would never have taken place."
Resuming the director said: "When
Vining was brought to this coast by H.
E. Huntington to take charge of the
Market street system he transformed the
system of management completely. Â¦" He
believed in making men bow to his will,
and every command issued by him was
studiously obeyed. His policy was an ar
bitrary one and met with little sympathy
amor.g the rank and file of the employes.
His espionage of the men on their days
off and his inveterate hatred of labor
unions and union principles, which
prompted him. to discharge any employe
heard to express himself in favor of
either, won for him the hatred of all the
carmen. The result was that when the
strike was declared the entire force to
a man deserted their posts and eagerly
embraced the very principles which Vin
ing sought to stamp out. Up to the very
eve of the strike Vining believed that the
men would not dare to walk out and he
imperiously declined to meet them en their
own ground. He believed them to be weak
and powerless, but his error in this re
ppect at a time when he enjoyed the con
fidence of his superiors knocked all the
props from under him and in the wreck
that was inevitable he was the chief
victim."
DIRECTORS ARE RELIEVED.
The directors of the company_appear to
be relieved now that Vining has resigned.
During the strike several of them de
clared that they would not oppose him
in taking this step and they intimated
that he could not resign too soon. The
question of his successor is now the all
absorbing topic in railway circles. Until
a successor is secured the affairs of the
system will be managed by senior Divis
ion Superintendent M. D. Stein, who Is
regarded as a very capable official. The
appointment of a manager to succeed
Vir.ing rests with President Holland, but
it is intimated that he will appoint only
such a man as is favorably considered by
the owners. The man who is nearest to
the throne at present is Slaughter Huff,
one of the best all-round railroad men in
the country. He is at present in Balti
more, but is expected to return home any
day. "*
VrNING DISAPPOINTED.
Some months ago when the project of
the sale of the Market street railway
system to the Baltimore syndicate was
first published by the Call, the announce
ment was made that Vining's manage
ment of the affairs of the new company
would be exceedingly brief. He was
among the first slated to go, as his pol
icy was distasteful to the directors, but
It was decided to take no steps to hasten
his removal until the new company as
sumed control of its property about May
1. The strike came, greatly to the sur
prise of the directors, who had been as
sured by Vining that there was absolute
ly no danger of such an event. His lack
of foresight in this respect, coupled with
the objectionable features of his policy,
caused the directors to look upon him
Â¦with marked disfavor, and when he an
nounced a few days ago that he was
willing to step out whenever the directors
.desired there was no protesting voice
raised.
The expected happened yesterday when
E. P. Vining, general manager of the
United Railroads Company, tendered his
resignation to President Holland, the
same to take effect Immediately. The
expected also happened when Resident
Holland signified his willingness to ac
cept the resignation and said that he
Â¦would inform the board of directors at
his convenience of Vining's severance of
connection with the corporation. Vining
emiled cheerfully, bowed, and his con
nection with the great street railway
corporation was permanently ended.

reads here of the savage charges of 'Cossacks upon

â¢and other hardships. How mistaken is that impres
sion I know from personal experience. A short time
ago I accidentally- got in a crowd. on" whom Cossacks
charged. They came riding down, riot very fast, with
swords not drawn, with only small riding whips in
their hands, and shouting' 'Please' pass on.' I saw
not a single trace of brutality, .No one was hurt; In
our country I have seen police who had not 'the same
consideration for an excited crowd as had these Cos
sacks, who are always portrayed as so fierce.' No

and gave ocular proof of its unequaled
efficiency in fires in tall buildings.'- ;
Public tidiness, says Professor Hamlin, "costs
more at first; than the untidiness of public negligence,
and this makes.it unpopulaj, but it brings good re
turns in the end. It pays, as all thrift pays." Of
that truth there can be no question. It would pay
San Francisco to improve her street's. It would pay
the Southern Pacific Company to improve its sta-.
tions. :
For this untidiness San Francisco is of course not
wholly responsible. The duty of , constructing a
proper railway station rests upon the railway com
pany, and that duty is rapidly becoming imperative.
American railways, so far as the East. is concerned,
have been progressive and magnificent in the con
struction of depots. Some of the stations in the
larger cities are equal to any the most magnifi
cent capitals in Europe can show. San Francisco is
deserving of as good treatment from the railroads in
this respect as other cities of similar importance, and
should President Harriman. provide us with a suitable
station it is reasonabl> certain the city would take
steps to make the avenues of approach worthy of the
new structure.
Anything uglier, shabbier and more incommodious
than the Southern Pacific railway station on Third
street can hardly be found in any' large city in the
world, and it would be difficult to. find a much dir
tier thoroughfare than that which leads from it to the
center of the city. Visitors who arrive in San Fran
cisco at that depot can perceive no reason why 'the
city should be looked upon as a metropolis. The
structure itself is so flimsy and so cheap that the im
pression produced is that it was designed as but a
temporary affair, erected because the business of the
locality did not promise to last long enough to jus
tify the erection of a durable building, and the
street upon which it opens furnishes little to remove
the impression.
The charges made in that statement could be justly
applied to other cities than New York, but so far as
the water approach is concerned San Francisco is
not among them. Our water front lacks a great deal
of being ornamental, but since the construction of
the ferry depot and the laying out of the esplanade
there is evidence at least of a movement to make the
harbor approach attractive and commodious. The
ferry depot itself is a spacious and stately structure,
and the great thoroughfare that leads from it to the
city is fairly well paved and well kept. Upon that
score, then, we are not subject to such severe criti
cism as the professor applies to New York, but when
we turn from the ferry entrance to the railway en
trance we are completely at his mercy.
Among other facts cited to sustain his indictment
Professor Hamlin says: "On his first visit to Europe
an intelligent American often opens his eyes to the
inferiority of our prevailing standards of public
housekeeping; but if he fails to apprehend this while
abroad it is painfully impressed upon him when he
disembarks at New York on his return. Arriving at
the richest port in the New World, he lands at a
decrepit wooden dock covered by a cheap shed of
timber and sheet iron. For this shabby landing the
city receives a rental of many thousands of dollars
from the steamship company. Emerging from this
unworthy structure he finds himself upon a street for
which for dirt, dilapidation and general squalor of
appearance it would be hard to find a match out
side of our own country. Constantinople can rival
it, but Constantinople is at least picturesque."
PROFESSOR HAMLIN of Columbia Univer
sity contributes to the Forum for May an ar
ticle on "Our Public Untidiness," which
serves as a timely reminder that while we are the
richest and most progressive people in the world we
are not using our wealth altogether to the best advan
tage nor making such progress as we should toward
the attainment of certain much needed improvements
in the conditions amid which we live. The profes
sor saj r s we "are the most untidy among all the*

;It is to be borne: in 'mind that the' calculation! as
sumes that -the banks will . keep its notes always in
circulation at interest. .Should^ it fail to do so the
profits would be reduced. It appears; therefore, that
the question of taking out circulating notes is ; one
that requires a good deal of close figuring on the part
of national banks to decide rightly at any given
The relation;: of ; the -national banks to the circula
tion of riotesvand the conditions under which it is
profitable for/them to' doVso have recently been made
the 1 subjects of an interesting report from the Treas
ury Department forthe : use of the House Committee
on Banking, and Currency? 4 From a summary which'
has ;-beeh. given Â¦out; through'. the press it appears the
net profits^ are by, no means so large as is generally
suppose'd.^Th^New York|Times jn^eyiewing the
treasury tables""explains them in'^thisfevly: "If a
bank should loan $100,000 at the rate' of 6 per cent
its revenue from the loans would be $6000. . Now, if
it should put that $100,000 in 2 per cent" bonds at
IO9J4 it could take out circulation up to . the par
value of -.the .bonds purchased, which .would-be
$91,324. Its receipts would then be, from interest on
the notes loaned $5749 44, and from the interest on
the bonds $1826 48, or a "total income of $7305 92.
The deductions from this income would be, for tax
$456,62, for expenses $62 50, forsinking fund $120 72,
or total deductions of $639 84. Taking this amount
from the gross receipts of $7305 92 there is a net
income of $6666 08, and a' net profit over. the loan
of the amount invested in loans of only. $666 08, or
0.666 per cent, or 1 two-thirds of one per cent. Con
trary to the usual impression, this/profit is smaller as
the current rate of interest advances.: ItJs 6.79^ per
cent when interest is at 4 per cent, 0.66 per cent at 6
per cent, 0.52 per cent at 8 per cent^'and only 0.38
per cent when interest is "at 10 per cent." K
T ( he complete ;figyresfbr March 31, 1902, as com
pared with those^ of March 14; 1900, show that the
aggregate capital of national ibariks ;has increased
from $616,308,09546 $672,759,195; or $56,451,100, and
circulation secured, by from $216,374,795 to
$317,460,382, a net increase pf $101,085,597. .In: addi
tion Â«to the foregoing amount of bond-secured circu
lation on March 3i'last*there was also in circulation

It- 'has been; decided by about all the soldiers; who
administered; the water, cure to Filipinos "that the
treatment is painful, but perhaps they were not
in a P.Q|itibn to decide' upon Â¦that -point V -The Fili-
p *"?.; ' ls l^ e man who- can give expert testimony on
the subject: ;. "\ ..: ;
To issue them required in the President_just the
quality that the people demand in that high office.
The jingo spirit which would create a solitude and
call it peace, which would order the murder of all
people over ten years old and reduce a populous isl
and to a desert on which a bird could not live, will
chatter its disapproval. But the real manhood and
courage of the country will applaud the President
and support his position. .. : '
These orders of the President bring in sight
pacification on the islands and a right spirit in Â¦> our
domestic politics,; and cannot be too highly ap
proved.
The halt has been called none too soon. The trial
of * General Smith, the order to desist in Mindanao
and the vocal embargo on Funston are all concur
rent and tell unmistakably of a reform in policy and
methods. They prove that the conservative /advice
of. Governor Taft is accepted as the philosophy of the
situation and that the noisy Funston and the military
hydropathists in the islands will understand that what
they say and do must no longer compromise the ad
ministration nor affront the people. ; ; .
The Funston spirit has protested that this order
will injure our "prestige." To the sober mind there
can be no greater injury to our prestige than by fol
lowing the policy of Spain, which we denounced, and
adding to it all the evil features which go with our
greater power and resources. Americans are not so
inconsistent as to approve the use by their army of
ficers or their representatives of methods, which were
made our excuse for interfering in Cuba and finally
taking from Spain her insular empire. More than
that, when informed they will not permit, such mis
use of their national strength to tarnish their national
character.
It is remarkable that these acts could .- go on so
long, and it is greatly to the credit of 'the^President
that he has interfered so promptly and powerfully
upon the revelation being made and has also re
buked the spirit behind these outrages by rebuking
the leading promoter of that spirit in this country.
He has gone still further. in the same direction by in
terfering to prevent a repetition of these scenes in
Mindanao and among the Moros.
Given a helpless but defiant people treated in the
Funston spirit, and there is created a condition for
ample exercise of . wantonness and inhumanity. The
story of the murder of a Filipino priest and the
taking of the watch and chain off his dead body by
a commissioned officer, and his burial secretly on a
baseball ground used by the troops, so that the grave
would be tramped down, is an abhorrent incident of
conquest which revolts the people of. this country.
It is now incontestably established that two or
ders were issued by high officers, "one to kill l aU
grown people and one, to kill all over ten years old,
and the trial of General Smith by court-martial for
the latter offense is evidence that the administration
believes the testimony of Major Waller. There is an
uneasy feeling in the country that these facts, secured
by so much trouble and against an obvious attempt
to prevent the revelation, implies that they are only
a small part of what might be told.
the War Department in economic legislation and the
revelations of war methods in the Philippines," the
impression is distinctly bad. The country] is rapidly
reaching the conclusion that there has been too much
Funston in military conduct in th*e islands. ' â¢
This disposes of Funston as an episode,; but his
stream of talk that ran before it T was officially
dammed has left a turbid impression that will long
remain. Taken in connection with the dictation, of
NOT long ago General Funston stated that he
was requested by the President to go to Bos
ton and repeat the various speeches he had
made in favor of hanging the college professors and
clergymen who petitioned Congress in the Philippine
matter. This amazing statement was not credited by
any thinking man in the country. But General Fun
ston acted upon the assumed approval of his extra
ordinary discussions, of the Philippine question, and
in a speech at Denver made an attack on Senator
Hoar. Then he applied for a leave of absence to go
to Boston and unsheathe his tongue. This leave was
not only promptly refused by the War Department,
but he was curtly ordered to cease his remarks upon'
the Philippines by the President himself. . ;,-.'
suppress wholly. " : There .are 'a thousand channels
by which Russians can obtain news and circulate it
outside the country. without the police knowing any
thing about' it.T: Exaggerated it may be, but it is not
absolutely false, .Despite Mr.' Tower's experience with
the mob and the Cossacks, it is safe to say there has
-been-a goodrdeal of bloodshed- between- them during
the last three months, and there is likely to be. more
before the ? year closes. ..'"Â¦ j /

when the officials abandoned their quest
for the murderers the crime passed from
the public mind. It was revived, however,
when prospectors brought the head to
town two days ago. The prospectors say
they were about to tunnel under a large
rock and were clearing away some debris
when they made the discovery.
DAYTON, Nev., April 30.â A-grewsome
find was made by a party of prospectors
in the Como Hills two days ago. The
head of Walter. Crowninshield, an. aged
and wealthy hermit, was discovered where
it had been concealed by I his murderers
two., years ago. The ; decapitated body,
which . had been burned on a pyre of
brush, was found" In June, 1900. The head,
brought to this . city " by officers, reveals
the tragic manner of death. . The skull
had been badly hacked and crushed, with
some weapon, probably the ax with which
it was severed from the body. The au
thorities have reopened an investigation
and hope to obtain some clew that will
lead to the discovery of the murderers. ;
Â¦ '"Walter Crowninshield resided in a cabin
two miles northwest of the old town of
Como. He was a recluse and his life was
a mystery to the miners and Inhabitants
of this section. He lived ; alone and . no
one, until after his murder, ever saw the
interior of the solitary cabin that housed
him. At times he locked the doors and re
mained in confinement for months at a
time. Lack of food alone drove him from
his shelter and then he would hasten to
the neighboring towns and . replenish his
supply without communicating with any
one. - Years ago he had prospected In the
hills and held several . mining claims.
From some of these he took considerable
gold and he was reputed to have much
treasure stored within the dingy confines
of his habitation, or buried where prying
thieves could not reach it.
During the early part of 1900. Crownin
shield disappeared, but little attention was
given . his absence at the time, it being
thought that the man had again entered
seclusion. In June of last year, however,
he was accounted for. What remained of
his decapitated body was found in a heap
of ashes about half a mile from, his cabin.
The officials, beyond establishing the fact
that he was murdered by robbers, could
make no headway in the case. Notwith
standing that a rigid search was made,
the victim's head could not be found; The
cabin had been ransacked by the murder
ers and there were evidences of a further
search for gold in the vicinity of the rude
hut. Â¦'Â¦".Â¦!Â¦' : Â¦'

. "The Slaves^ of the Orient" is the
bill, a spectacular melodrama : with the
scenes laid In Constantinople, and every
thing from Armenian, massacres to the
Florodora sextet is included in the enter
tainment. Moon-faced houris abound,
wending their bejeweled way 'round rose
scented fountains, or dancing sensuous
measures for the tyrant pleasure of the
Grand Turk. The Sultan's favorite wife
Fatima (Agnes Ranken) in pale blue satin
trews and other handsome heathen garb,
plots lusciously for three stirring ac*s.
The Sultan himself (Stanley Ross), fierce
ly bewhlskered, outvies the bravest Turk
that" ever adorned a cigar box. There are
milk-white Arabian steeds also in the pic
ture, Armenians in endless numbers, and
bold, bad Turks by the bunch. There is
a group of Americans, also, who show up
rather unplcturesquely against the bar
baric splendors of the Orientals, but who
make things hum nevertheless. The set
tings are as handsome as have been seen
here for some time, In any theater, and
the whole production, from the spec
tacular standpoint, is a great credit to
the enterprising management. The scene
in the Sultan's- garden, the street scene
and the harem are thoroughly character
istic and picturesque;
The drama has the same lavishness In
plot and incident. - Briefly its story ' is
this: The Sull&n of Turkey falls In love
with an American girl, j niece of ' the
United States Embassador,^ =and does her
the honor to desire to add! her to his col
lection of Lights of the Harem. The lady
Is unambitious and prefers an American

tan's favorite In office, Fatima, has got
her weather eye on. The Sultan, amazed
at the lady's want of taste, determines
to reform It by massacreing a number of

tion this week in VThe Starbucks," Opie
Read's "\ new ;. pastoral â¢, drama, splendidly
given by ' the Â¦ Neill ? company. â¢ The " Nellls
have seldom had a play in, which so many
members of i the clever company, have had
opportunity to shine.â -Nelll himself,* as the
old :. â¢ moonshiner, Jasper 'Â¦; Starbuck, is v a
very: foreign Neill, -but yet" a particularly
effective one." Miss Chapman, seen as the
"The Fortune Teller" is bowling : mer
riljÂ» along at the Tlvoll, but gives way on
Monday evening next- to "The - Singing
Girl,", the joint production of -â¢. Smith
Strange and . Victor Herbert. â¢ The v pretty
opera was one of. the favorite productions
of "'Alice' Nielsen and -her company and
shouid Â¦ meet with as , much success t as its
predecessors . of the present : Ti voll Â¦' season
have met . with. Annie Myers, who ; has
not Â¦ had * quite ?. all â¢ the ' chance that I was.

attractions. . .The rest of the company
have all good parts. ,
"TheÂ«Lash of the Whip," a'farcecom
edy of the; merriest, is convulsing Alca
zar audiences." Its ingenious complica
tions and ; the | good acting are serving to
draw, crowds to the popular playhouse.
Next week one of the chief events of the
Alcazar season will take place in the pro
duction of "When the Heart Was Young "
a . new rural drama, by the local play
wrights," Charles Francis Bryant and Lotta
Day Coleman. - Much care has been ex
pended upon the play, that has also had
every advantage of rehearsal and- fitness
of mountings. Â¦ >;-r ': â¢â¢-*Â¦
N.. C. Goodwin and Maxine Elliott have
repeated their former triumph in "When
, We Were Twenty-one" at the Columbia
Theater and the first week of their en
gagement has- seen a series of: capacity
testing audiences. For the second and
last week of their engagement the stars
will appear in a repertoire of two of the
greatest successes. On Monday,' Tuesday
and Wednesday nights and at the matinee
on J Saturday Madeleine Lucette Ryley's
original comety in four acts, "An Amer
ican Citizen," will be staged. On-Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday nights "When
We Were Twenty-one" will be the bill
for the last times. Another great attrac
tion follows, John Drew and his splendid
company appearing in Robert Marshall's
play, "The Second in Command," opening
on Monday, evening, May 12, and continu
ing for two weeks. â¢
There is a capital collection of enter
tainers at the Orpheum this week, includ
ing the five : Nosses, the Florenz troupe,
Jack Norworth, Louise Dresser, and Mil
ton and Dollie Nobles, who present "At
Bilgeville Junction," a screaming farce.
The Pony. ballet, Wilton brothers, and the
Knight brothers, all of whom are good,
are. in their last performances. Next
week comes Julia Heinrich, the renowned
concert, and oratorio contralto, who has

Armenians. She wilts, and to save them,
consent* to enter the ; harem, and so on
and so on. Old Glory is largely used In
draping 1 the play, and with the "Star-
Spangled Banner" triumphantly ends it.
... Annette ' Marshall shines as the Ameri
can girl, and Georgie Cooper as a French
damsel who seems to have wandered In
from "The Geisha" is piquancy itself.
Agnes Ranken is Fatlma, and deals a
knock-out rose to the hero with all the
grace of the Orient. Stanley Ross is a
Sultan of the deepest dye, and is hand
somely foiled by Earle Brown, who
makes a very fetching hero. The rest
of the cast lives well up to things, and
there is a good olio of specialists, an

SANTA CLARA, April 30.â Santa Clara
SANTA CLARA, April 29.â The cere
mony of raising the old mission
cross, blown down inthe storin, of
March 1, will take place in front
of St. v" Claire's? church on Satur
day. The cross was originally planted in
1777. Just 125 years will have elapsed from
the time when It was first set- to the date
of its placement in the present year. It
has stood. in. three centuries.
There will be exercises -appropriate to
the occasion. Rev. Robert JS.Kenna will
deliver the address. Â¦; > . Â¦ ' - .
Weather-worn and decayed on the out
side, the timber of the cross is yet sound
and firm. It has been dressed and re
covered with tongue and grooved planks
three inches thick. These planks are so
carefully joined'that the wood of the cross
is practically sealed hermetically and
will endure : for another hundred years or
more.
From the outside edges of the cross the
wood removed has been carefully pre
served and is being made into miniature
crosses. These are eagerly sought by the
faithful and are worthy, of the diligence
shown in securing them. They represent
about all that is le % ft of the early mission
belongings that is not sacred to the keep
ing of the church. '

Flaherty rushed into the saloon and said
that he wanted his dog. Umland replied
that the dog was not there and Flaherty
retorted, "If I don't get that dog I will
kill every one in the place." Roller,
Frank P. Howard, Julius Levy and John
J. Sullivan were playing cards at a table

Flaherty and said "Bill, I am done for "
He staggered toward the end- of the bar
and fell. Umland said to Flaherty, "What
do you mean by raising a disturbance in
my place; you must be crazy." Flaherty
then backed out of the saloon, after fir
ing another shot. .

Charles Swain Opposes
Probate of Late
. Brother's Will.
Charles W. Swain of Xew York, brother
of the late Edward R. Swain, the archi
tect, tiled an objection to the probating of
his brother's will yesterday. He' claims
that the document was not entirely writ
ten or dated by the deceased; that it was
net signed by him in the presence of the
subscribing witnesses and that when the
document was executed his brother was
under the influence of Olive Catherine
Longabough, his nurse, who was named
by the testator as residuary legatee.
Swain died April 10, 1902, leaving an estate
estimated to be worth $10,000. His death
occurred at the Lane Hospital. Previous
to his removal to the hospital he had re
sided at 791 Hayes street, the home of
Miss Longabough's sister. Miss Longa
bough cared for him while he remained at
her sister's home and when he was re
moved to the hospital she went with him
arid nursed him until he died.
In the disputed will Swain bequeathed
fl to each of his two brothers, one of
whom. F. W. Swain, resides in this city;
his office furnishings to intimate friends
and the rest of his estate to Miss Longa
bough. who, it was said, was the promised
wife of the deceased. The will is holo
graphic, having been written by Swain
on paper bearing a printed date line and
the location of his office. The contest of
the will is based principally upon the fact
of the printed matter being- upon the
paper, as in many instances wills of a like
character have been upset.
NEW CHUTES WILL OPEN
IN I BLAZE OF GLORY
That the new Chutes is a decided im
provement over the old will be easily seen
by pleasure-seekers. The famous resort
reopens to-day. It is located on Fultcn
. street, on the north side of Golden Gate
Â£Park, and can be conveniently reached
by taking the McAllister and Geary street
cars. The new Chutes covers 260x600 feet.
The corporation controlling the resort ex
penJed $75,000 for the grounds and $325,000
for improvements. The theater that has
been erected will seat 4000 people and is
said to be the largest in the United States.
The stage is 38 feet wide, 46 feet deep and
26 feet high, with rising scenes and the
best of appointments. The proscenium
arch has a fourteen-foot sounding board.
A pleasing feature about the grounds is
. the use of concrete, which makes the' re
sort free from dust. The buildings have
been painted white and trimmed with car
nival colors. The menagerie Is a large
{building ' and excellently ventilated.
â¢The "happy family," which is composed
of monkeys, dogs, parrots and other do
mestic animals, has a fine building to it
eelf. The scenic railroad Is more than a

AN ASTONISfflNG; -PROOF OF BLOQD
CLEANSING AND RESTORATION TO .
. i 'COMPLETE HEALTH...
True health can only be maintained by
keeping: the body free of acid and slug-
gish blood and morbid waste matters. The
blood that Is pumped through the heart
to all parts of the body carries â¢ nourish-
ment and health, or poison_ and the seeds
of death. . ;
Close confinement In badly, ventilated
offices, stores ; and workshops during the
winter months . has lowered the vitality
of tens of thousands, j Poisons and Impur-
ities have been implanted in the blood ;
these agents of death must be expelled
if health. would be maintained during the
coming summer.
The month of May should be renovating
and bulldlng-up time with the. vast army
of weak, debilitated, and broken down
men, women and young people. ; . ,- ,
If the work of purifying and vitalizing
the blood be longer deferred, eruptions,
blotches, sores, eczema, scrofula, erysip-
elas, and other dangers are sure to be
your, portion.
Paine's Celery- Compound meets suc-
cessfully at this season all unhealthy
conditions of the blood. It is the only
medicine that can guarantee perfect pur-
ification of the vital fluid; that can give
true nutriment to the nerves and tissues;
that can bestow new life, vigor, and
strength for the enjoyment of summer
and the prosecution of life's duties.
Mr. George Schmidt, 20 West Third St.,
Cincinnati, Ohio, briefly and forcibly
writes regarding his rescue from a slow
but sure death. He says:
"Since infancy. I have been bothered
with impure blood and nervousness. I
tried almost all known remedies and went
to many physicians, but nothing seemed
to do me any good until a druggist rec-
ommended Paine's Celery Compound. I
used this great medicine, and before I
had finished two I found relief.
I am now using ray - sixth bottle and
never felt better. in my. life. My nervous-
ness is all gone and my skin clearer than
ever 'it was."

PITTSBURG, April 30.â The May day
strike fever is on in this city, and in the
morning nearly 12,000 workmen will | fail
to report for duty because their employers
have refused, to comply wlthÂ» their de

PROVIDENCE, R. I., April 30.â An un
looked-for development in the affairs of
the American ' Woolen Company, in con
nection with . the strike of weavers, in
thirteen of Its mills, came to-day when
an ' order was issued to gradually close
the yarn-making departments in the Ol
neyville mills. : Over 1200 hands will be
paid off. .The closing of . a number of
mills of j other, cities, has stopped the de
mand for yarns. It is estimated that this
strike at present affects 20,000 persons.

NEW YORK, April 30.-After spending
two days in endeavoring to arrive at a
settlement of their differences, the oper

the matter up had not up to a late hour
to-night been definitely settled, but the
probability, Is â¢ that | the meeting will take
place either Friday or Saturday of the

Every opportunity to obtain information
from : those who have taken part in the
conference proved futile. Â¦ The operators,"
however, seemed in a happy frame of

opinion among outsiders was that some

The decision of the executive body of
the Republican State Committee in favor
of giving to the rank and file of the party
tha fullest and fairest opportunity to be
represented in the nominating convention
meets with general commendation. The
machine had already made arrangements
for the appointment of Gage delegations
In Humboldt, Tuolumne, Calaveras" and
other counties. Hender was counted on
to deliver Tuolumne County to Herrin,
Burns and Gage. The boast was openly
made, that -Bull', would bring down the
Humboldt delegation to be used as the
bosses should desire. The bosses in their
desperation may attempt to set aside the
recommendations of the executive com
mittee and force the general committee to
a recognition of the machine method of
appointment.
The Governor is enlarging his gold-brick
yard to embrace the reward industry. Not
satisfied with the offer of glided packages
to the army of job chasers, he. is going
still further and promising rewards which
the law does not authorize . him to offer
and which he cannot legally pay from tho
State funds.
Section 1547 of the Penal Code gives the
Governor this authority:
The Governor may offer a reward, not ex
ceeding $1000, payable out of the general fund,
for the apprehension:
First â Of any convict who has escaped from
the State Prison; or ; .
Secondâ Of any person who has committed
or Is charged with the commission of an offense
punishable with death.
Another section of the code extends in
this wise the reward offering power: \
Section 1. The Governor shall offer a stand
ing reward of three hundred dollars ($300) for
the arrest of each person engaged In the rob
bery of or in an attempt to rob any person
or persons upon, or having; in charge, in whole
or In part, any stage coach, wagon, railroad
train or other conveyance engaged at the time
In carrying passengers, or any private convey
ance within this State, the reward to be paid
to the person or persons making the arrest Im
mediately upon the conviction of the person or
persons- so arrested ; but no reward shall be
paid except after such conviction.
On his own personal account the Gov
ernor may offer a reward of one million
dollars for the arrest and conviction of
thugs, but he cannot authorize to pay., a
dollar of the 'public money -for such pur
pose. His latest reward of $500 is offered,
not by virtue of authority vested in him
by the' constitution and laws, but by his
irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to
pass out a gold brick on every occasion.
If. Gage desires to shine as a captain of
reward industry," let him increase the
amount offered for the apprehension of
the "man who struck Billy Patterson."
Other mysteries might be solved by the
prudent Investment of money in rewards.
The world has long - desired to know
"where Moses was when the lights went
out." Here is a field for Gage to fill. Let
him offer a reward of $500 to ascertain the
whereabouts of Moses. While on the sub
ject of rewards Gage might offer a bonus
of one thousand dollars for the arrest and
conviction of the person or persons who
put' the gubernatorial . bee in Eugene
Schmitz's bonnet.
The Harbor Commissioners yesterday
overlooked the . request made by ship
owners representing more than 500 vessels
to reappofnt George H. S. Dry den to the
office of assistant chief wharfinger. Dry
den's term expired a few weeks ago. Â¦ The
board yesterday, . on the motion of Com
missioner Mackenzie, appointed J. G. Tyr
rell as Dryden's successor. As wharfinger
and assistant chief, Dryden has rendered
the State eight years of faithful service.
He thoroughly understood the require
ments of his office and is held ' In high
esteem by .the shipping community, the

SACRAMENTO, April 30.â At present
there is great activity in labor circles in"
Sacramento, and several organizations
have taken steps to obtain increased
wages. To-day a committee from the
employes of the streetcar lines of the
Sacramento Gas, .Electric and Railway
Company held a conference with Man
ager Albert Gallatln, looking to a read
justment of the wage schedule. The best
of feeling .prevailed, and the men express
the belief that they will obtain all ' they
desire without resort to an ultimatum.
The committee received with favor a
proposal from the company and will re
fer, it to the carmen for their action. ." It
provides that all men In the company's
service less than two years shall be paid
21 cents an hour; those employed from
two to five years, 22 cents; five to eight
years 23 cents; eight years and over, 24
cents, i. As near, as possible, the â¢ figuring
contemplates a ten-hour day. The com
pany has always supplied passes over its
lines to the families of its employes and
the men are paid .every night.
All of the members of the Journeymen
Carpenters' Union < will demand $3 50 for
an eight-hour day to-morrow. Members
of the Builders' Association do not take
kindly to the demand, saying they have
many men working for $2 a day, who are
not sufficiently skilled to receive $3 50 a
day. The union insiste on the flat rate
however, and trouble is looked for.
To-morrow -the. local Horseshoers'
Union will Insist on compliance with its
demand, notice , of which was served
three weeks ago, for $3 a day for floor
men and $3 50 for firemen, instead of $2 50

the employers will pay the increased
rate. Â¦
A disagreement is declared to" have
arisen between the Sub-Contractors'- As

grainers, growing out of the latter doing
work for sub-contractors not members of

ficulty will be settled by arbitration.

Auditor Baehr Charges
School Board With
Duplicity.
The Auditor further says that the only
way to erect schoolhouses Is by bond is
sue, because it cannot be done under the
dollar limit. In 1901-1902 the sum of
$1,368,707 57 was allowed the department
For 1302-1903 the Auditor recommends
$1,200,000. besides an additional $80,000 for
permanent improvements. In the July set
tlement with the State the School De
partment will receive $90,000, or a grand
total of $1,370,000â an excess over last year
of $1292 43. - -â¢ - -Â¦
Had the School Directors and their staff of
-assistants furnished me with correct data and
scrutinized my -estimate all: these bickerings
could be avoided. The fact of the matter is
that they would have me accept their stuffed
and false figures so that the department would
realize an amount In excess of the charter pro
visions. I will not accuse them of willfully
falsifying- their records, but I will say that It
is a matte? of "rank incompetency on the part
of the members of the Board of Education In
allowing such data to leave their office. It
has been no desire of mine to antagonize the
members of the School Department, but on the
contrary it has been my aim to encourage every
movement whereby they may be benefited.
Under these latter figures the depart
ment would be entitled to $1,200,000, as
recommended by the Auditor. Baehr says
the records were mutilated in a number
of instances. Baehr's statement continues:
Auditor Baehr Issued a statement yes
terday In reply to the criticism made by
the Board of Education regarding his
estimate of the requirements of the de
partment for the next fiscal year. Baehr
denies the charge that he has been in
strumental in crippling the School Depart
ment, and says he has allowed the maxi
mum limit permitted by law. Baehr
charges that the figures on enrollment
and daily average attendance of pupils
have been falsified by the attaches of the
Board of Education. The statement fur
nished by the board originally showed the
attendance in schools in 1900-1901 to be
86,162 and enrollment 49,978. The figures re
turned by â¢ the secretary of the board,
taken from the records, was only 34,158
for attendance and 42,000 for enrollment.
Baehr being doubtful of the correctness of
these figures had them experted, with the
result that he found 35,998 for attendance
and 42,788 for enrollment. ....:.â¢ . .:_.

' TELEGRAPHIC.
SAILED.
The Attorney General made a long ad
dress, in which he cautioned the jury
against being mystified by telegrams from
hair-brained individuals like William T.
Stead and others, and alleged incrimina
ting documents, which were merely the
"ordinary armament of a blackmailer."
Continuing, he said:
"Nothing could be more gross and
treacherous than, the prisoner's behavior
throughout." He appealed to the jury t.o
arrive at a verdict on the evidence which
would rid society, v temporarily, at least,
"of a cruel and dangerous woman." -.
During the address by the Attorney
General Princess Radziwill drummed an
grily on the desk with her fingers and
was continually engaged in writing notes
and tearing them up.
Counsel for the defense, in addressing
the jury, denied fraudulent intention on
the part of his client, and dwelt upon the
unrevealed mysteries behind the case.
He appealed to the jury on the ground
that nobody had suffered by the frauds
and said that a verdict of guilty would
be equivalent to hanging the Princess to
the nearest tree, for then every door In
Europe would in the future be closed on
her.
The Chief Justice, In summing up,
cautioned the jury to disregard the pris
oner's noble birth and antecedents and to
decide the case according to strict Justice.
The jury brought in a verdict of guilty
on all the counts against her.'
The Chief Justice then addressed the
prisoner impressively. He referred to her
birth, her education and her position In
society. Owing to her delicate health,
the Chief Justice said she would not have
to perform hard labor, but that-she would
be confined for two years In the House of
Correction or any other place the Gov
ernor was pleased to appoint.
The prisoner bowed her head and re
ceived her sentence calmly.

Bead About This Case,
" I am 70 years old. have been in good health
until six years asro. when I caught cold and it
settled in my eyes. They became inflamed.
Itchy and stuck together some in the mornings,
but thinking they would soon get well them-
selves, and month after month passed and
they 'were sometimes better and sometimes
worse, but each attack was worse. I went to
zny family physician and he helped them
tone, but about two years ago,a white scum or
opacityâ what they call a cataractâ com-
menced to grow over my eyes, and inflam-
mation got worse: made me almost totally
blind. The doctor wanted to operate on my
eyes, but I would not allow him. and I drifted
along when a neighbor saw the name of Dr.
W. O. Coffee of Des Moines. Iowa, and that be
bad a new way of curing blind people. I
irrote him and got his book and placed myself
under his treatment immediately. My eyes
commenced to improve ths very first day and
Improved steadily until my sight was restored
so perfectly that I could read a newspaper
Â¦without glasses. His treatment is mild, heal-
ing and soothing, and I want to say to every-
one who has eye trouble, write Dr. Coffee: his
fees for curing you will be less than any other
doctor and bis new Absorption treatment is
ail that Is claimed for it." .

CHICAGO, April 30.â Considering the fact
that this was the last day of the month and
preceded one of the four big delivery days of
the -year there was a fair bull market in wheat.
True, trade was dull in the main, but prices
held well the greater part of the session. Bull
ish news was present in good force. Receipts
were fair. Kansas reports were still complain
ing of insufficient rains and forty-flve counties
in Minnesota and South Dakota reported a de
crease in the spring wheat area amounting to
20 per cent. Some fair early, buying by the
leading corn bulls started prices up well There
was the usual changing, however, July belne
taken up for May at l%c spread. The' quiet
ness of the market .helped bears in their cour
age to sell the further options and the ad
vances were not held. July, which sold early
at 76%c;- closed a trifle better than yesterdnv
%Â®%c up, at <6%c. . /esieraaj,
Corn trade was quiet and "uneventful. Most
of the business wYis that of changing from May
to July. July closed weak, %c lower, at 63%(B!
Oats were very dull. July clo'sed %c lower
at â¢>o%c. < . Â¦ .
Provisions were weak, influenced by liberal
receipts at the yards, lower prices and fair
selling. July pork closed 20c down, lard 12% fa
15c down and ribS;10e lower. ,' -"M 1 *

WHEATâ Paris and Liverpool futures were
both, higher. Bradstreet's gave the status of

rope and -afloat, a ' decrease of 900, 000 ; ; total
decrease, C, 878, 000 : bushels. ,
Chicago was firm, with light offerings, and
diminishing receipts in the Northwest and
Southwest. The; Northwest markets Â¦".' were
strong and the Southwest markets weak. There
were seaboard rumors'' of a big export business.
Crop reports from Kansas continued bad, seven
of the largest wheat counties, which produced
over 20,000,000 bushels last year, reporting a
condition- of 40. Â¦ A' large â¢ Minneapolis miller
wired that 35 counties in Minnesota and South
Dakota indicated a 20 per cent Â¦ reduction in
acreage. Omaha wired that wheat and oats
were badly damaged in Nebraska, the wheat
staple being almost ready to joint and only
three or four Inches high. There was heavy
liquidation in May.-which caused a break from
76%c to 75%c. â¢--.,' J- â¢ . - - ....... v

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
Spirited buying of Chicago Great Western, a
rise of 4 points in Illinois Central and over 2
points each in St. Paul and Rock Island had
a sustaining influence in the railroad list for
a time, but prices gave way there in the un
settled state that developed. The effect of at
tempts to market stocks which were previously
manipulated was seen in the 6-point drop, in
Northwestern, 13 in Chicago, . St. Paul,- Min
neapolis and Omaha preferred and 5% In Keo
kuk and Des Molnes. There was some calling
of loans following the flurry in certain Btdcks.
The resulting rise in the money rate and the
recovery in sterling exchange at Paris ap
parently had the effect of further deferring
gold exports.
The bond market was active and prices were
lower in symoathy with stocks. Total sales,
par value. $3,800,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

THE COAST RECORD.
STOCKS AND BONDS.
NEW YORK, April 30.â A nervous and
feverish tone developed in to-day's stock mar
ket, principally as the result of the extra
ordinary mo\-ement in International Power,
u-ith several contributory causes, including a
stiffening in the money rate, the uncertainty
incident to operations for May disbursement*,
the outcome of the anthracite labor conference
and renewed reports of rain in the Southwest.
International Power opened at 1Â«7. a decline
of a point from yesterday's close. It recov
ered and then clumped by micceiealve stages of
from 1 to 3 ooints to lul. It then rallied 20
points, jumping as much as 5 points between
eales and fell back again to 162. Apparently
no bids could then be secured for the stock
and it was neglected for* an hour until Just
before the close, when a sale was effected at j
320. V The day's net decline was 78 points. I
Yesterday the stock sold, at 199. which was
the record price. For many days previous
successive records had been established. In I
February the stock sold at 80 and in March I
the present move started below 00. It has |
been accompanied of late by many outgivings j
cf large acquirements m ot new properties by
the company and by The payment- of a 2% I
j^t cent dividend, which was called quarterly, i
after providing for the preferred stock require
ments. The chaacter of the movement has
been viewed with skepticism for some time
And has attracted v/ry little outside I follow
ing. Within a. day or two profits of many
points have been taken on a few light bold
ings. The officers of the company could give
no Intelligible explanation of to-day's - hap
penings beyond the obvious fact that support
ing orders had been withdrawn. The closing
quotation for the stock was 75 bid and 150
asked- This movement necessarily had some
sentimental influence on the rest of the market,
which, naturally was most pronounced in in
dustrials, especially Jn those regarding which
little definite information Is ' known. The de
clines running from 2 to 5% noints In the .
American Locomotive stocks..- Railway Steel
Fprlng, American Grass Twine and Colorado
Fuel â¢ may be cited as examples." The higher
grade Industrials were not so much affected,
although the United States Steel stocks con
tinued heavy. Amalgamated - anO. Sugar were
v ither. the latter rising 2 points at one time.

DE2CAND FOB GARDENER.
A resolution offered in the Senate to-day
by -Patterson-' of .Colorado, directing- the
Secretary of -War to order by cable Major
Gardener, now in the Philippines, to come
immediately ; to Washington to. appear as
a witness before the Philippine Commis
sion, precipitated a.warm disdussion. The
debate continued : tor about Iwo hours,
much feeling being manifested on both
sides of the -chamber.- The charge was
made by the minority that the majority, of
the committee was endeavoring â¢ to sup
press facts and information. This was de
nied by the chairman of the committee.
Lodge," who said .that any such action
would be inconceivably stupid. All
parties, he insisted, were anxious for the
fullest Information, but he and others
contended that it would not be advisable
to cable to the â¢ Philippines for , Major
Gardener," as he was about.' to come home
and would be here In time to appear be
fore the committee. Patterson and Car
mack of Tennessee urged that Gardener's
testimony was particularly important and
that it ought to be had before action was
taken on the pending bill. The resolution
finally went over until to-morrow.
MANILA, April 30.â Lieutenant George
P.' Shields, aid de camp to General Jacob
H: Smith, testified at to-day's session of the
court-martial which is trying the general.
The lieutenant said he knew well the sig
nature of Lukban, the . insurgent leader,
who Â¦ was captured February. 22 by Lieu
tenant Stedler*s Philippine scouts in the
island of Samar. The Â¦ order . issued ' to
poison the natives' spears was undoubted
ly signed by - Lukban. The witness also
said Lukban confessed to him that he was
the" author of the proclamation setting
forth , that German warships were bom
barding Vipan and that the.Filipino navy
was blockading 1 Manila, which was issued
to encourage the Filipinos. Â¦- . -
" The defense then rested its case and the
court adjourned until Saturday. Â¦ Â¦ '
"You can believe that. Believe what
you wish and I will believe what I wish."
.General MacArthur referred to his many
Â¦efforts to bring about a cessation of hos
tilities and stop the bloodshed. These
efforts, he said, were directed to Aguin
aldo through some of his friends, because
in his opinion Agulnr.ldo was the "incar
nation of the revolution." MacArthur
Said the disparity between the killed and
Â¦wounded of the Filipino and American
forces was due to the fact that the Fili
pinos knew notmng of the double sights
on the rifles.
Senator Patterson wanted to know if, as
a matter of fact, the contacts between
our troops and the Filipinos were simply
assaults and pursuits. General Mac-
Arthur denied that this was so, saying
that since the affair has reached the guer
rilla stage, the United States troops have
had the greatest difficulty, in finding the
Filipinos, so that whenever the Filipinos
attacked it was in the nature- of a sur
prise, the Filipino -posting, himself in
mountain gorges and firing first. Under
these circumstances our officers and men
would go in after them, and then the na
tural supremacy of the American showed
itself : and every ' man that could be
reached would be killed. -â¢ \
'Responding to a question by Senator
Carmack, General MacArthur said that
when he assumed responsibility for the
methods adopted in capturing *Aguinaldo
he did so without conferring with the au
thorities at Washington. The plan was
General Funston's. he said, and he (Mac-
Arthur) assumed the responsibility of ap
proving it. At no time, said General Mac-
Arthur, replying to an inquiry from Sena
tor Patterson,, did he violate the rules of
civilized warfare. .-Â¦Â¦.-.â¢ .'.".,...
:. General MacArthur.' was excused : until
to-morrow Â¦ and the committee went into
executive session. By a strict party vote
the committee refused to subpena Major
Cornelius Gardener, Aguinaldo, " Slxto
Lopez and Mabini. The question of send
ing a sub-committee to the Philippines to
continue the Investigation was passed
over. â¢
"We have as much right to believe that
from an American officer .who is the civil
Governor and who is there in the province
as we have to believe you," replied Sen
ator Patterson, which brought the retort
from General MacArthur:
Replying to this statement, General
MacArthur informed Senator Patterson
that . if he preferred to believe that he
(MacArthur) could not help it.
"Thirty-three and a third per cent In
one province," remarked Senator Patter
son.
'"WASHINGTON, April SO.â Major Gen
eral MaoB-rthur to-day gave further tes
timony before the Senate Committee on
the Philippines. "Â¦ He j explained his state
ment made yesterday that absolute chaos
would result ' should independence be
given the Filipinos and the United StatÂ£3
forces be withdrawn, by saying that the
people of the Philippines, being less pre
pared for self-government and adminis
tration than any of the Latin- American
republics at the time of their emancipa
tion from Spain, their own unaided efforts
to accomplish self-regeneration would in
all probability prove abortive.
The people of the Philippines, he said,
have rudimentary ideas and aspirations
and are therefore in an essentially plastic
condition, which under the tuitionary con
trol of ,the United States would, in his
opinion," admit of rapid molding of the
body politic into a consistent, self-sup
porting, commonwealth.
Even the best thinkers; he said, among
the Filipinos have no conception whatever
of the practical mechanical efforts where
by the results they are all anxious to at
tain can be successfully accomplished.
American withdrawal from the islands
would, in his opinion, result in the perma
nent failure of republican institutions in
the East and a fratricidal war which
would continue until suppressed by some
exterior force. The broad generalization,
he said, is reached that the United States
must retain the archipelago as a tuition
ary annex; that we must plant our insti
tutions there; that we must contend for
commercial supremacy and perhaps com
bat for political supremacy to . overcome
the inherent difficulties of the situation
which will require the most profound ef
forts of constructive statesmanship. He
gave it as his conscientious belief that the
presence of the United States in the Phil
ippines is an unmitigated benefaction to
the Filipino people.
/'Do you mean the Filipino people that
are left alive after they have been sub
jugated?" inquired Senator Patterson.
MACAETHTTB'S WASH WOBDS.
General MacArthur declared that he did
not mean that there would be any. un
usual destruction of life in the Philip
pines.
"The destruction," said he, "is simply
incident to war and, of /course, embraces
a very small percentage! of the total pop
ulation, which is densc'f

The treaties with Nicaragua and Ecua
dor have expired, but. the committee act
ed on the theory that favorable action by
the committee has the effect of renew
ing them, so far as t)iis country Is con
cerned.
The effect of this amendment is to re
quire the House of Representatives, as
well as the Senate, to act on the treaties
before they can become effective; The
defeat of the treaty with the Argentine
Republic was due largely to the fact that
large quantities of wool are produced i in
that country, while the opposition to. the
Jamaica treaty was largely on account of
citrus fruits and sugar.
"This treaty shall not take effect until
the same shall have been approved by
the Congress." Â¦ -
The treaties on which favorable action
was recommended were those between
the United States- and" Spain, Nicaragua,
Ecuador and the,' Dominican republic and
four with Great Britain, catering Ber
muda, Barbadoes, British Guiana. Coicos
and Turns islands. All the treaties upon
which favorable reports are to be made
are to be amended in accordance with- a
previous agreement by adding the fol
lowing provision:
i WASHINGTON, April 30.â The Senate
Commitee on Foreign Relations to-day

Company, to determine the division of owner
ship in the Michael Davitt lode, was post
poned until May 20.
Dickey is referred to in uncompliment
ary language and the report states that
a request has been made for his expulsion
from the Grand Army. Dickey served in
the Union army, and after the war settled
In Louisiana. He was appointed Consul
at Baracoa, Cuba, under President Har
rison, and President MeKlnley. in 1S97.
named him Consul at Callao. This latter
consulate pays SJOOO per annum. 'Dickty
has just arrived in New York from his
post. â¢
In his controversy with Dickey McBride
has had the support of Abraham Lincoln
Post. G. A. R., of Lima, Ohio. A report
from_this post describes McBride as an
honest young man of pure moral life.. ._
"The 14th of May last." he wrote, "I
plainly told United States Consul William
1$. Dickey that he was systematically de
frauding the Government that had in
trusted to him the high position he held.
I gave him to clearly understand that as
Consul's clerk and Vice Consul 1 could
not consent to remain with him longer
under the circumstances surrounding his
office, and which surely in the end would
confound me as an accomplice with him;
a state of affairs I was unwilline on my
part should continue longer. In answer
to this declaration he flew into a violent
rage, answering me that it was none of
my business; he was responsible for what
was being done and that he intended to
continue on as he thought best."
The charges against Dickey were made
by William S. McBride. formerly Vice
Consul at Callao.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
If your feet could laugh what merriment
they would indulge in at your expenseâ paying j
Jji Five and Six Dollars for shoes less comfort-
W able than the Walk-Over Shoe at $3 5Oâ
JfeJ with not nearly as much modern style
either. You'll never know real Shoe
Goodness until you've bought a controlling f*
interest in a pair of Walk-Overs. After '0k
your first pair you'll safely trust your feet
to another â and they'll reciprocate that f=|l^\
trust. Your foot-worries will be at-an end. c^Lg
California oak soles go into every
pair of Walk-Oversâ the best "bottom stock"
money can buy. Then these soles go through a
patent process controlled by the Walk-Over
Factory that renders them tough as copper, and
as flexible and yielding as a sandal. V
The process of building a Walk-Over Shoe
will be shown you at our store upon d>
application â the shoe all dissected j^Jr ( vJU
in all its stages; from the hides Never
to the elegantly finished product. Less.
What $5.00 shoe will stand such dissection?
