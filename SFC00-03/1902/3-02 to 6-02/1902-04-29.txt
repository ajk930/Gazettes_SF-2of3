very much pleased to know what had
been accomplished. .
When Attorney General Davies left the
White' House he said; "I have received
a letter conveying . the proposition ; that ' 1
should meet representatives . of the big
packing-houses. Why I should meet them
or what. would happen as the result of
my. meeting them has not been disclosed.
But you can say that I have declined
emphatically to have anything to do with
any such conferences. I have no busi
ness conferring with these men. They are
charged, with violation of the law, with
oppressing the public. If they are guilty
it is my. business to prosecute them."
Attorney General Davies, accompanied
by Controller Miller of -New York,- ap

then . went on to say that through the
influence of a committee of a Republican
club of New York a conference would be
held In Washington on Thursday between
Attorney General Da vies on one side* and
the representatives of the trust on the
other. This conference was apparently
to be held for the purpose of permitting

the understanding that the United States

"tickling the ears of groundlings with a
speech full of menace to America's only
friend among the powers of Europe."
After quoting the speech the Globe con
tinues:
We are notETcaly concerned either for the
threat or the crude vulgarity which cause*
Sliaw to apply it to a particular power, but
what impresses us with a sense of American
decadence Is the manner In which the absurd
spt*ch was received. Were an English minis

WASHINGTON, April 28.â The con
ferees on the Chinese exclusion bill have
reached a complete agreernent.
It strikes out that portion of the Senate
bill limiting the extension of all exlstia!?
laws to the life of the present treaty and
re-enacts them bo far as 1b not Inconsis
tent with the treaty obligations -until
otherwise provided by law and extends
the laws to our island territory so far
as applicable.
It allows Chinese to enter for exposition
purposes and retains the provision re
garding certification in the Philippines. â¢
In the House the conference report on
the Chinese exclusion bill was adopted
without comment.
In the Senate Platt of Connecticut pre
sented the conference report on the Chi
nese exclusion bill. He briefly explained
that after a "somewhat strenuous discus
sion" the conferees had agreed that no
definite limitation should be placed upon
The operation of the Geary law as re
enacted, but that it should remain in
force until otherwise provided by law.
In response to inquiries by Teller, Platt
explained that the operation of the law in
the Philippines, including a registration of
the Chinese in the islands, had been
placed in the hands of the Philippine
Commission, but the commission would
have no authority to admit Chinese to the
islands.
Without further comment the confer
ence report â¢sras ajxeed to.

"WASHINGTON, April 28.â When thÂ»
Senate convened to-day Harris of Kansas
presented the following telegram he had
received from the Kansas Millers' Asso
ciation: - .
Kansas millers, on account of foreign dis
criminations, with the best wheat in the world
at their door, are not producing over one
third of their full capacity. Unless your Com
mittee on Foreign Relations can give us re
lief through reciprocal concessions, placing our
mills on an equal basis with foreign mills,
many of our mills -will shut down indefinitely
and some of them will be forced to the wall.
In our distress we look to our Senators for
relief. r.;:.
The telegram was referred to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.
Plea of Kansas Millers.
Miller is the ex-student of the Normal
School who has had so much trouble over
his diploma, and was thÂ« author of the
article in the Los Angeles Times styling
San Jose "The Sodom of the Pacific." Of
late he has been conducting a semi-week-/
ly paper called The Crucible.
The Council refused to accept the
charges, because they were not sworn to,
and Miller would not swear to them in the
Council chamber. The Councilmen de
nounced the charges as a political move
and declared that Miller was being used
as a catspaw. The Council, after a re
cess, adopted resolutions declaring that
Miller was an erratic and irresponsible
persons and had been made a tool of by
a certain newspaper so that the charges
could be published without fear of prose
cution for libel. It condemned such a
course. The resolutions further stated
that the Council believed the charges were
malicious and without foundation, but
that if they were sworn to and presented
by a responsible person the Council would
investigate them.
As a fourth charge, Andrew Mackenzie
was accused of causing all the repair
work of the Police and Fire Department
to be done at the San Jose Foundry, of
which he is part owner.

Charge three involved the levying of
blackmail upon gambling houses. Twen
ty-five dollars per month was collected
from each house under promise of im
munity, It was alleged, and in some
months the collection amounted to $400.
Frank Cheek, the proprietor of a saloon,
was named as the person who collected
the money and carried It to the California
Club, where it afterward went to John
D. Mackenzie.
The second charge was that Mackenzie*
and his \ colleagues on the commission
have levied blackmail upon Charles P.
Hall, manager of the Victory Theater, In
the shape of theater tickets. Miller al
leges that Mackenzie and W. J. Oster
man, president of the commission, afler
causing many petty annoyances, suggest
ed to Hall that the theater would not be
molested if the commission were fur
nished with free tickets. Each Commis
sioner received two tickets, but this was
Increased to thirty tickets a performance,
worth from $15 to Â£K>. John D. Mackenzie
also was accused of receiving free tickets.
FREE THEATER TICKETS.
Miller charged that Andrew J. Macken
zie, together with other members of the
Police and Fire Commission, during the
past two years, and particularly during
March, April and May, 1900, collected from
the salaries of certain members of the
Police and Fire Department sums rang
ing from $12 to $70. This money, It was
alleged, subsequently, passed to the- chief
of the Fire Department, who took it tb
the California. Club and paid it over to
John D. Mackenzie, a brother of Andrew
Mackenzie.

"Our course in regard to the ruling, of

evening. "I do not expect we will comply
with the ruling, but we will let the courts
decide whether we are right or If the fruit
shippers are right. I ao not think- the
ruling of the commission is equitable.
The railroads are the responsible parties;
when we guarantee to take the fruit to
Its destination and do so, our manner of
doing bo Is not the business of any <me.
If we want; we have the right to deliver
the fruit on wheelbarrows. 'l*he railroads
make a rate of $1 25 a hundred on citrus
fruit to Chicago and the same rate to
New York. "In order to make this rate
we must have satisfactory arrangements
with our connections East. '
"We cannot comply with this ruling and
continue to handle the fruit business. 'Be
fore the railroads adopted the system of
routing shipments the business was in a
constant state of demoralization. Shippers
were in the habit of sending their fruit
over any road whose overzealous agents
would give them a few dollars rebate on
each car. and we must either cut rates to
meet that sort of competition or give up
handling the business, if~we do not take
therouting into. our own hands." ;

HUMOROUS SIDELIGHTS ON THE SANTA CRUZ CONVENTION OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE SONS.
At the same time and possibly having
some connection with this tragedy oc
curred the accident that resulted in the
death of Lineman Fipp. He was engaged
in painting the crossarm of a pole near
Palocedro with a companion. This man
whose name is BIngham, says that there
was a blinding flash and he was thrown
to the ground- When he was able to get
up he found Fipps hanging among the
wires, dead.
REDDING, April 28.â There were two
accidental deaths on the lines of the
Northern California Power Company In
this county to-day. They occurred at dif
ferent points. Patrick Klley. an aged
ehe'epshearer, and his horse were killed
near Cottonwood. The man was unaware
of being anywhere in the neighborhood
of an electric wire. E. J. Fipps, a young
man employed as a lineman, was killed
while at work on a pole near Palocedro
and was left hanging in the wires.
The sheepehearer was en route from
Red Bluff ffbrtb in search of work. At
the Taylor farm, a few miles south of
Cottonwood, he alighted, tied his horse
to the gate and went in to call on the
farmer. An electric wire, carrying 20,000
volts, had fallen across the barbwira
fence and when Riley returned to untie
his horse his hand came In contact wiih
the charged wire. His other hand was
on the animal's neck. Both man and
beast were instantly killed.

TACOSIA, April 28.â The towns of Skag
way. Atlln and White Horse have de
cided that Asiatics shall not become resT
dents. The question was brought to an
issue by the attempt last month of Eng
lish mine-owners to import several dozen
Japanese to work in the Atlin mines.
Through prompt action by Atlin miners
they were returned N to Ekagway and
shipped back to Vancouver.
Believing that further efforts would be
made to introduce Asiatics Into that part
of Alaska, citizens of Skagway held a
mass-meeting last week, with three hun
dred men present. A committee was ap
pointed to see that no more Asiatics are
allowed to land at Skagway. The com
mittee visited Proprietor Broemser of the
Astor Hotel and was Informed that his
Chinese cooks would be employed only
until he was able to get competent white
help. These are the only Orientals em
ployed permanently at Skagway. The
Anti-Chinese Association has organized
branches. at Atlin and White Horse.
Former Governor Swlneford. Judge De
laney. District Attorney Crews and other
prominent cn<?n of Juneau are not in sym
pathy with the Territorial Club recently
formed there and at Skagway to agitate
an extension of Territorial government
to Alaska. They addressed a mass
meeting in Juneau last week, declaring
their belief that Alaska already has a
better government than any other tern,
tory or possession of the United States.
Resolutions opposing the request that
Congress permit the erection of Alaska
into a- territory were tabled after a vig

nard was adjudged guilty of, contempt of
court by Superior Judge Dougherty to
day and sentenced to serve twenty-four
hours in the County Jail. Bonnard had
disregarded the court's order by falling
to pay alimony to- his divorced wife,
Marie Bonnard. " The latter received a le-'
gal separation frpm Bonnard a year ago
last December after many domestic quar
rels, and the ex-husband was directed by
the court to pay $30 a month for the
maintenance of his minor children and
$50 for attorney's fees, together with Â¦ a
like sum for court expenses during the
divorce proceedings. . . " * .
Bonnard testified to-day that he had
paid $437, to his former wife, and that
he could not at present further comply
with the order of court. He had spent a
portion of the funds he had at the .time
the divorce was- granted In attempting to
find- a location- in which he could en
gage in business to earn, sufficient money
to pay the alimony. He had spent- more
money for court expenses In a recent en
deavor, to obtain possession of his chil
dren in the Superior Court of this county.
A letter written in . San Francisco ; on
January 8 from Bonnard to his former
wife was read. In it Bonnard .declared
that Mrs. Bonnard' s attorneys had tried
to obtain money from him, but he had
been '. 'too crafty'.' and "too smart.". .

Vining reconsidered his a'ctlon, and in

Building TradQS Council
Has Demand Under
Consideration.
Carpenters and Teamsters Ad
just a Number of Their
Grievances.
A request for an Increase of pay of $1
per day has been made by the members
of the Journeymen Plumbers' Gas and
Steam Fitters' Union upon the Master
Plumbers' Association. The journeymen
are connected with the Building Trades
Council, and the'r request for an In
crease must first receive the sanction of
that body, and then three months must
intervene before the new schedule can .
be put into effect.
The recent spurt in the building indus
try in this city has made the laboring
man appreciative of his ability to earn
larger wages than he has received before.
The Journeymen plumbers, who now re
ceive $4 per day, are demanding J3 here
after, with a graduated scale for help
ers. The Master Plumbers" Association
will consider the matter at a meeting to
be held on Friday night. If the increase
demanded is rejected the matter I will
be referred to the Building Trades Coun
cil, at present has the demand un
der consideration.
A demand recently made by the Team
sters' Union for an adjustment of the
schedule of wages adopted last October,
at the close of the strike, has been
granted by the employing teamsters em
braced in the Draymen's Association. A
number of discrepancies crept into the
submitted schedule when it was made
up. The members of the Teamsters'
TJnidri went to their employers- and osked
that -these differences be adjusted. With
out any outside interference, where the
demands of the men were just, the rates
were agreeably arranged.
Owing to the large dr-mand for car
penters, many men are coming here
from- the East. Carpenters' Union No.
Â¦183 initiated fifteen new members last
night, and has a number of applications
pending. Other unions report a propor

MAKES A PLEA
FOB EX-CONVICT
Montgomery Does Not
Yet Believe King Is
a Hypocrite.
Says Insincerity Is Found in
Every Condition of
Life. .
Charles Montgomery, president of the
California Prison Commission and Prison
and Hospital Religious Association, dis
cussing the rearrest of Joseph King, the
ex-convict, yesterday expressed himself as
not yet 'being ready to believe that the
man is a hypocrite.
ln referring to King and the many ex
convicts witn whom ne comes daily in
contact Montgomery said:
The arrest of Jo% King, the ex-convict, is
most umoztunate â whether just or unjust â
end may do much toward poisoning the minds
of the public against all discharged prisoners,
who at best have ~a hard struggle tor ex
istence and success in lire. It must be re
membered that ex-convicts have very few
lriends and many enemies â very few en-
couragements and many discouragements â very
lew kind works, but many harsh words and
tutpicious looks. A\ hen one of those poor men
no astray what a howl is raised, and you hear
jn every hand the most unkind things said
about them, and all are classed toKetner us
incorrisfibles and unworthy of an opportunity
to make a livinc or to be allowed to live in
ireedom.
The worthy suffer for the misdeeds of the
unworthy. The public always hears of the
man who tots astray, ana does wrong, but it
never hears of the many men who keep straight
and do well and prove worthy of the helping
hand that they receive. Now I propose tell
ing you something of the men you never hear
of. During the last fifteen months more than
125 discharged prisoners have passed through
our hands and only three of the number have
gone back to crime. Is it not worth while
to keep on in this good work and take courage
with such results? We are willing to be de
ceived three times out of 125 in this work of
saving: and helpins fallen men. We remem
ber the love of him who said: "I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
It would be a libel on the gospel of Christ to
say that these men are beyond the reach or
salvation. It is distinctly said that "Christ
died for the uncodly." God Is going to fill
heaven with redeemed einners â washed in the
blood of the lamb.
In reference to Joe Kin* I am not yet pre
pared to believe that he is a hypocrite. It
may prove upon investigation that he has done
no wrong. I have known him on many oc
casions to divide his money wÂ«th ex-convicts
that were more needy than himself. On three
occasions he bought clothes for men with the
money that he ought to have used to clothe
himself with. But the rule is that when a
man is down. Jump on him and oalnt him
black. I have no sympathy with such work,
nor ressect for those- who do it. If there are
hypocrites among ex-convicts we must remem
ber that there are other hypocrites. There are
hypocrites in business, hypocrites in secret so
cieties and in all other societies, hypocrites
in every church, hypocrites in the select so
ciety circles, hypocrites among professional
men and bankers, and hypocrites even among
beggars. But we are not going to condemn
all because of the few hypocrites found in their
ranks, so do not condemn all the discharged
prisoners and make them suffer for the few
who have done wrons. Give them work, not
money. Si>eak a kind word to them and It
will do you good to see how much they will ap
preciate it. Help the -man that is down. This
U ChrUtlike. Â¦___

BRUTALLY BEAT HIM
George Lawrence Accuses Police Offi
cer of Unprovoked Assault,
Which. Is Denied.
George Lawrence, an old-time gambler,
over 60 years of age claims he was the
victim Sunday morning of a brutal and
unprovoked assault at the hands of Cap
tain John Spillane of the Southern Police
Station. Lawrence'was arrested recently
on the charge of grand larceny and liber
ated on baiL He says he was coming out
of Zinkand's when he was accosted by
Splllare, who asked him what he was do
ing out of Jail. He replied that he was
out on bail, and then claims that Spillane
without the least provocation on his part
knocked him down with a blow from his
net- He arose and was again attacked,
and begged the police officer to spare him.
He says he was bleeding freely from
the nose and mouth when he succeeded In
slinking away through the crowd that
had gathered. He went to a friend's
house and changed his linen, which ha
Bays was soaked with blood. Yesterday
he exhibited several contusions on the
lower part of his face, which he said were
caused by Spillane's blows. He says at
least fifty people witnessed the assault.
Captain Spillane denied absolutely that
he struck Lawrence or that any trouble
ensued between them. He says he met
Lawrence coming .out of Zinkand's and
questioned him, but in no way attempted
physical violence.

Some Mystery Attaches to Manner in
.Which He Met His
End.
Passers-by found the . dead body of an
unknown man yesterday forenoon lying
in the hallway of the hoUse at 829 Howard
Street! There was a wound at the base of "j
the skull, which looked as though it ;
might have been Inflicted with a slung- ;
shot. The body was taken to the Morgue,
and an autoj>sy showed a fracture -of the
skull, which evidently caused death.
Detectives Wren and Bell were de
tailed to make an investigation, and in a
partial report to Captain Seymour last
night stated that they believed the old
man was killed by a fall. It was learned
that he was intoxicated during the morn
ing: and was In company with a young
man at the David House. 715 Howard
street. They left there together, and the
old man was not seen- again until, his
body was found. It is known that he had I
no money shortly before his death; and no 1
m- tlve can be ascribed for an assault. â¢
He may have fallen backward in the"
hallway where' he was found and thus
received his death wound. The detectives
are looking for the young fellow who.ac
companied the old man, but up to- a late
hour last night had not succeeded in lo
cating him. ;
The proprietor of the David House says
that the dead man was not a resident of
Ban Francisco, but came from somewhere
in the country and generally stopped at
the David House during his visits to this
city.

DEAD IN HALLWAY
dy of the Frenchy species, was presented
.t the Alcazar Theater last night and it
proved about the funniest and most en
joyable piece ever seen at this popular
place of entertainment. The audience was
kept laughing all the time and it left the
theater still laughing. There is the usual
suspicious mother-in-law, the gay and de
ceitful young husband, ..the 'jealous wife,
the sympathizing friends on each side and
incidental characters. M. L. Alsop, as
the husband, was really excellent and en
tered into the 1 spirit of the thing with
great" zest. Henry Shumer, as his friend,
who is henpecked, was equally as good
and helped materially in keeping up - the
fun. George Osbournewas inimitable as

Grand Opera -House.
Edward Harrigan received a hearty
welcome, at the Grand Opera-house last
evening In "Old Lavender" that he will
surely remember long. . At his first ap
pearance for the evening he received an
ovation before he had a chance to speak
the first of his lines. Handclapplng lasted
several minutes, and when Harrigan tried
to go on with the play his voice was
drowned by applause. . Perforce he wag
compelled to make a brief speech. Ke
said only a few words, which were to the
effect that he thanked the audience for
its kindness. The audience applauded
Harrican whenever he sang or took part
in a good scene, and especially when he
uttered the noble sentiments that the
play gives rise to in the last act. Harri
gan has lost none of his power to please;
his acting of the Old Lavender role was
consistent. If â¢ his voice lacks much, he
retains all the charm of style in the ren
dering of ballads that he ever had. There
was other singing, notably that of a very
Fischer's.
Manager Sam Frledlander of Fischer's
Theater wore a capacious smile on his
countenance last night as he watched a
long line of theater-goers waiting to buy
tickets for "Fiddle Dee Dee." "The fourth
week.,*' he Bald, jubilantly, "and we're
turning them away." The burlesque has
certainly caught the town. Every per
formance the theater Is crowded and the
standing room only sign is exposed night
ly. The "Florodora. Sextette" is extremely
funny. Bernard, Dill and Kolb divide the
honors for fun-making. Prepossessing
Maud Amber as Mrs. Waldorf Meadow
brook does some clever work and the rest
of the cast is made up of a number of the
cleverest fun-makers that It has even
been the good fortune of San Franciscans
to see.
The police are now bo firmly convinced
that Charles B. Hadley, the missing Ex
aminer accountant and bookkeeper, has
much to explain In connection with the
mysterious death of Nora Fuller that they
have decided to spread broadcast over, the
land photographs of the suspect in the
hope that he may be apprehended in some
ol the large Eastern cities or in Mexico.
Botn Chiei Witunan and Chief of Detec- ,
lives Seymour are working like beavers I
on the clews that lead them on the trail
of Charles B. Hadley as the possible mur
derer of Nora Fuller. . Detective Tom
Gibson has been detailed on the case. He
is running down every scrap of circum
stantial evidence that has any bearing on
Hadley' s disappearance. Carrie Dixon,
tne young woman who was known to
Hadiey's associates as his wife, visited
police headquarters last night and had a
long conference with Captain Seymour.
Just what the nature of the discussion
was Captain Seymour refused to state.
The police were startled yesterday by,
a report that Charles E. Paddock, a pan
tryman employed by the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company, had seen Hadley on
ihe water front last Friday night. Pad
oock was at one time employed o/i the
Examiner as a solicitor, and he knew
Hadley very well. When the startling
clew was nnally run down it was found
that Paddock had met a man in a water
tront saloon who resembled Hadley so
much that he accosted him and Invited
him to take a drink. Paddock stated to
Captain Seymour last night that the re
semblance was so marked that it was ful
ly half an hour before he. Paddock, could
be convinced that his companion was not
Hadley.
Detective Tom Gibson rounded up a
man named Terry Fagan last night, but
after questioning him closely it was found
that he was not W. L. Fagan, who, while
contined in the City and County Hospital,
stated to the physicians there that Char
lie Hadley had given him a check for $300
for some unknown reason. The entire
detective force have been given instruc
tions to locate Fagan. They want to
know the exact nature of his relations
with Hadley and why Hadley gave him
a check for $390.
The exclusive publication of the story
in yesterday's Call to the effect that,
three days after Hadley disappeared,
"Mrs. Hadley" spoke of his strange con
duct and stated that his hair had turned
white and that he had to take sleeping
powders, and that he was laboring under
a great mental strain, has caused many
of Hadiey's friends to shake their heads
and admit that he has much to explain.

A PERFORMANCE without a blem
ish was that given last night at
the Columbia Theater by Nat
Goodwin ' and Miss Maxine El
liott and their company In "When
We Were Twenty-One." ,
Esmond's play improves on acquaint
ance, and there has in fact been an actual
alteration In the third act, a tonlng-down
of the much-discussed scene in the "Fire
fly's" apartments, , that makes consider
ably for its betterment. The neatness of
construction. \ swift, spontaneous action
and clever massing, of the admirable ma
terial, mark Mr. Esmond as a little mas
ter of dramatic craftsmanship, and the
play as one that . should ( be counted in
heavily when the scarce good things of
latter-day theatrical loot are remembered.
How much Mr. Esmond owes to his In
terpreters it. would be difficult to say.
The playwright has not only the foremost
American comedian In his service, but
alsoâ peace, ladiesâ the moat beautiful
woman on the American stage. Neither
is there a weak spot In the whole support
ing company, that looks after the various
more or less onerous parts, with ample
efficiency. A remarkable point in the per
formance is that the years (two) since its
first production, while adding noticeably
to its finish and ease, have not robbed it
of one Jot- of freshness. It went with the
same vim and spontanelcy but without
the jolts of a first night performance, and
with all the smoothness and delightful
speed that time has given.
Goodwin has a part that fits him like
a new glove in the role of "Twenty-one's"
guardian. His quiet, distinguished meth
ods, pervading humor, a fine stripe of pa
thos, effective man-of-the-worldliness,
make the figure of Richard Carewe a bril
liantly conspicuous one In comedy por
traiture. Mr. Goodwin bears the London
honors that lie so .thick upon him* with be
coming modesty, and responded with his
familiar unassuming air to the hearty
plaudits that greeted him on his entrance.
So, too. Miss Elliott, whom . London has
robbed of no whit of her American beau
ty, while giving, perhaps, added grace to
her talent. Handsomer than ever, Miss
Elliott now claims serious consideration
as an actress. Her work has gained in
speed, lightness of touch, humor, one
might almost say temperament, and it
would not be easy to imagine a more
competent, and certainly not a sweeter or
handsomer Phyllis Erlcsoit. Her voice,
too. Is smoother and rounder, though It
still lacks some measure of beauty in its
quality.
A very clever bit of work was Frederick
Tiden's. assumption of the part of the
"Imp." the young man that four anxious
guardians have raised by hand. Mr.
TIden has a highly humorous apprecia
tion of the role of the young man who Is
Just old enough to know everything,
crude, raw, inexperienced, yet of noble in
stinct, and his acting showed the nicest
balance and sympathy. The "trinity"
was filled to its utmost requirement by
Neil O'Brien as Waddles; J. R. Craw
ford, as Colonel Miles Graham, and F. H.
Tyler as Terence McGrath, an excellent
trio. One of the best contrasts of the
play is afforded by the scene where the
"Imp," savagely desirous of impressing
his manhood upon his four guardians, op
poses his raw wisdom to their mature
charitable experience. Miss Florence
Haverlelgh has the role of the Firefly,
and plays it with extraordinary emphasis.
It is difficult to believe that she is not
exactly what she seems to be, the heart
less, worthless, fascinating vampire of the
half-world that the poor "Imp" has set
his young affections on. The rest of the
cast fits all needs, and a large house that
looked as if two strikes were ended heard
and applauded the play.'

While the movement may appear, to outsiders as a
sort of forlorn hope, it is by no means so. The pro
irioters of . the league: are encouraged by what has
been. done by the Welsh and the Belgians to preserve
their ancient language. It is said by the writer:
"The league disclaims any intention of depriving the
Irish people of the use of the' English tongue,, but
asserts its aim to be to make them" bilingual. * * * fit'
points to the industrial / success of the ' Belgians,
â¢Welsh' and other bilingual nations; as evidence. of the
acuteness of, intellect which bilinguation gives'." * He
; For the purpose of extending the use of the lan
guage and giving it an expression in literature more
than 300 tranches of the league have been started in
Ireland. There are others in 'every part of the world
where Irish are congregated,* and it is noted that
"from far-off Buenos Ayres. there comes an unusual
amount of monetary help to the organization:"
According to the recent, British census the number.
of persons in Ireland who "could speak Irish only was
38,121, those who spoke both Irish and .English "were
642,053, making. a tctal Irish speaking, population of
680,174. The accuracy;of the figures is, disputed Â«by
the Westminster Reviewer, who claims that the Irish
speaking part of the population of Ireland'is not less
than 1,000,000. - â¢ . i
The main", field of action on the part of the Gaelic
League is in the' districts that lie around the Irish
coast north, west-and south, from Donegal to Water
ford. It is said the inhabitants of those districts are
as pure Gaels as. can anywhere be found, some of
them being of a wholly unmixed race. The language
they use to-day has undergone very little change for
centuries.- An'authority onthe^subject is quoted as
saying: "1 never take up a new translation from the
older Irish literature but I am at once delighted and
amazed to note the trace of resemblance between the
Gaels of a thousand years ago and the Gaelic speak
ing peasant of to-day." -
ACCORDING to a writer in the Westminster
Review. the Irish language movement, which
has been in operation hardly ten years, has
already reached proportions that assure eventual suc
cess in the double object of extending Irish as a
spoken language and cultivating; a modern literature
in the Irish tongue.

The oiAbreak of the, peasants can hardly be said. to
have come as a surprise, . for some weeks ago the
chateau of the Duke of Mecklenburg in Southeastern
Russia was pillaged: and burned by ambb made tip
mainly: of peasants living on , the estate. Among the
rioters, however,! were ".a 'good many "who .were not
peasants, but men of. a high order of intellect and of
marked resolution. , It may. be . remembered .tttat
shortly after the riot it '.was reported that a numbW
of the prisoners taken by. the police had. refused to eat
in an effort to. kill, themselves by starvation, but were
being artificially fed^y'the police. 'One of the group,
in whom a special interest .was taken because of his 1
connection with . the â¢ Orloff ; family; .managed to hang
himself while in .: prison; and the tragic occurrence led '
to something. like ah exploitation of the whole story?
Among the reports given out to confirm the story of
conspiracy, is, one to the effect that the police have
discovered a large number of manifestos calling upon
the workingnien in the manufacturing districts ' to
prepare for a general strike' on Mayday. "^ Some of
the manifestos, it is said, hint at the killing of Sipia
guine, who was looked upon by the radicals as the
leader of the reactionary 'party. Thus it appears that
while the. police have been busy in. crushing, the" stu
dent revolt a more dangerous one has bqen growing'
up among ; the workingmen, and 'now, to still further
disturb^th e country'/ the peasants ;l have risen \ and have
begun looting the; estates of the nobles and commit-
DESPITE the care with which the Russian Gov
ernment supervises all reports of current
events in any part of the empire and the dras
tic'methods By which "it undertakes to suppress ail
that is unfavorable to the administration, enough
has been made .known' tq .shpV. that ,the discontents
of the students at the university are as 1 threatening as
ever, while the situation has . been ' rendered, even
more hazardous by an- uprising of peasants in many
provinces. The Government-is thus called upon to
confront at once the ; intellect and -the brawn of the
country. 'Between thV students' and the
ithere is probably hot muclr sympathy 'except that
which arises from antagonism to the common; foe, but
that will be sufficient tc en'abie them' to assist one an-'
other in opposing the police and : the soldiers even if
they cannot combine for carrying out ulterior reforms.
The recent assassination of M. Sipiaguine, which
was at first attributed to an act of. personal revenge
on the part of the student who killed him, has since,
been declared to be the outcome ; of a widespread
conspiracy. -It may be. the story of conspiracy is: not
true, but the Government has taken advantage of.it
as an excuse for enforcing more stringent regulations
upon the.students and those who are supposed to
sympathize with them."
LORD KELVIN in his reply to the address of
welcome on the occasion of the reception given
him at Columbia University paid to American
scientific and inventive genius a high tribute by de
claring it had been to him an inspiration at every visit
- he has made to this country. "I came to America for
the first time," he said, "in 1866, and then I got a
wonderful inspiration from Cyrus Â¦ Field. Ten years
later I came o^er to your Centennial Exposition and
America had given to the world then a triumph - of
science in the telephone. I got inspiration on that
visit from meeting and talking with Alexander Gra
ham BelL The next time I came was in 188.}, and
then I found the great, achievement of Edison per
fected and New York as bright by night as by day j
through his invention." ,. ...
t That each of the three visits of the great scientist
should have been marked by the coincidence of ' a
new and notable advance in man's mastery of the
forces of nature Is in itself a striking illustration of
the scientific attainments and mechanical ingenuity of
our people. It is rendered the more interesting, how
ever, by the fact that his present visit coincides with
the announcement from Washington that an Ameri
can inventor, Professor Fessenden, had perfected a
sj-stem of wireless telegraphy which in many impor
' tant respects is superior to that of Marconi.
We have here then in the lifetime of a single mart
fdur great strides forward in the path of civilization â
the ocean cable, the telephone, electric lighting and
wireless telegraphy. America cannot" claim exclu
sive credit for either of those achievements, but it is
certain the names of the men from whom Lord Kel
vin received inspiration attest that she holds a fore
most place in the ranks of the nations to whom* the
world is most indebted for its* advancing welfare.
It was a gracious act on the part of the distin
guished visitor to recall to the minds of his audience
the great men among their own countrymen, and the
audience was fully capable of appreciating it. Among
those who were there to welcome him were the fac
ulty of the university, representatives of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers,!the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement "of 'Science, the Ameri
can Physical Society, the American Astronomical
Society and the New York Academy of Sciences. "To
such men the statements of the speaker must have
been thoroughly grateful, for the compliment was
not only to . their country but : to themselves as co
workers in the cause of American science.
The commendation is the more gratjfying because
of the high character of the man from whom it came.
The old saying that "praise from Sir Hubert Stanley
is praise indeed" hardly fits the case in this instance,
for Kelvin's praise is worth much more than that of
the famous Sir Hubert. He is one. of the men of our
time who are so supreme in their special line of work
that their commendation is a distinction to any upon
whom it may be conferred. *
There is no slightest ground for believing that the
words were intended merely a?" compliments to hia
hosts or were in any Way insincere. Lord Kelvin's
intellect is of a nature that fits him to value the char
acteristic excellences of American "genius. He is
thoroughly practical, and looks upon the conquest of
the physical world as the best way of benefiting man.
Referring in the course of his speech to what has been
done in the way of developing electrical energy at
Niagara he said: "Beautiful as is that wonderful
work of nature, it would be more beautiful still if
every particle of those waters fell upon turbine
"wheels, every one of which was turning the wheels of
industry."
That statement may shock some sentimentalists and
self-styled "lovers of nature," but it is in line with
the prevailing American sentiment. American.inspi
ration is toward the improvement of the material
conditions of men, and the. results thus far. have
shown that such improvement is attended by the most
universal intellectual and moral advancement. W&m

to predict that she will be a second Ninon de l'Enclos, and will, like her, torture
the hearts of men till she. reaches the green age of seventy. It was out of con

The people are just getting a trifle 1 fatigued with
Cuba. The Republican party shows signs of surfeit
therewith. We have had Cuba for three meals. a
day since 1898. We were thrown into spasms of sym
pathy and rage by an artfully overdrawn appeal to our
sympathies and have been involved in difficulties and
expenses of which the next three generations will not
see the end. It is time to talk about something else,
time to take account of stock at home and see what
is doing.
-The winners of the victory in the " House ; are
taunted with being in revolt against party discipline,
when the fact is that the military sponsors of a new
departure in economics were in revolt against the de
cencies of the party. Added to their offensive pres
ence in the affair was that of the Cuban junta, dictat
ing to the people of this country what they shall do in
a policy profoundly affecting every American interest.
Added to their appearance in the affair was its inva
sion by the resident of New York who recently went
to Cuba for the first time in a quarter of a century to
be inaugurated President. He has been an excellent
professor of languages.'.no doubt, and would have
been equally successful in music and dancing if he had
Â¦added* those accomplishments to his repertoire. But
he is not known among the masters of economic
science, nor even among its students, nor yet among
its tyros. He may make a good President of Cuba,
for all that, but one thing is sure â he cannot appear
in the dual character of President of that republic and
economic manager of this.
The Call has from the beginning deprecated the.
issue that has developed this admonitory situation.
Th'e reasons given foi' demanding free trade with
Cuba have been utterly without force and have been
urged by means sure to cause just such a revolt as has
happened. The transfer of the control of s a purely
economic policy to the War Department and the en
listing of generals of, the army to force Congress into
compliance with orders from the new source of au
thority was offensive. It had no excuse. It violated
the traditions of Congress and affronted the sensi
bilities of the people. It is not for Governor General
Wood to teach Americans their duty, in a purely civil
matter of policy, nor for the War Department Â¦- to
make bargains involving the revenue policy of the
Government, nor the protection policy of the Repub
lican party. .
The positions taken by them were stated in the
strongest terms, were in line with the history and
policy of the party, and were not answered during the
debate. They adopted the expedient of removing the
differential on refined sugar simply: as tactics to de
feat the bill and committed themselves to nothing out
of line with the principles of .their party, and nothing
inconsistent with their whole allegiance. This makes
their position one of peculiar strength, and it is not
.weakened by the many evidences of popular approval
that are abroad since they defeated, the deserters ;of
protection. - ! , r
After they had,' by the solid Democratic vote com
ing to. their side, put into the Cuban bill the amend
ment that kills it, they stood firmly against any propo
sition for tariff, revision or removal of protection.
The allegiance of the Republicans who followed
Hepburn and Littlefield cannot be questioned.;- They
stood by therseasoned principles of their party. â¢ They
stood by the declarations of Dingley when chairman .-.
of the. Ways and, Means Committee,' and they.
stood by the declarations of Payne, who was;
promoted to that place by Dingley's death.
They had not changed, but V, Payne had.
They had taken, his. expressions of principle and
Dingley's upon the stump pf 1900 and Had won the
greatest party victory in our history. They refused to
make a sequence of that victory the repudiation of the
principles and pledges upon which it was wotu %
- . . Â¦ Â¦ v Â¦ 7 ?
THE proceedings in the House upon the Cuban
tariff are admonitory. When men like William
Aldcn Smith, Littlefield, Cushman, Hepburn
and other prominent Republicans who stood with
them, including a majority of the Iowa delegation and
all of. California, find it necessary to stand out and
fight for American rights against the official leader
ship of the partyin the House, it is time to get out the
chart and look at the compass, take an observation of
the sun and find where the ship is upon the wide
waters of the political sea. '>-

Another of tho overdue fleet has been re
ported and on the reinsured list there is now
only eight vessels. The British ship Corunna,
which was quoted at 15 per cent, was sighted
by the steamship Enterprise on April 24 In lati
tude 32 18 north, longitude 125 15 west, and
asked to be reported all well. The Corunna
Is out eighty-six days from Newcastle. Aus
tralia. She Is laden with coal. Under ordinary
chcumstances no anxiety would have been oc
casioned by her failure to arrive, but the na
ture of her cargo and the recent disastrous ex
perlence of the Franklstan made the under-
Overdue Corunna Safe.
The United States revenue cutter Thetis Is
etill at W. A. Boole's shipyard, undergoing the
repairs made necessary by her recent colli
sion with Howard-street wharf. The repairs
are almost completed and the Thetis will short
ly be turned over to Captain Healy to get
ready for a northern cruise. Captain Hamlet,
chief of construction of this station, fs re
ceiving the condolences of hlÂ« friends on his
Inability to shake himself clear of the Thetis.
She has been under repairs since last Octo
ber and the morning she hit Howard-street
wharf Captain Hamlet was going Â¦ to turn . her
ovt-r to her new commander. He was going
to turn her over in first-class repair and fully
coaled. She came to grief before the transfer
was made, and Instead of steaming proudly
to her anchorage limped across the bay with
her bow In splints and still very much in need
of the good offices oPthe chief of construction.
Thetis Almost Beady.
THE steamship Enterprise, the
pioneer of oil burning ocean
liners, arrived yesterday from
Hllo. The Enterprise Is the first
vessel to attempt a long voyage
dependent entirely upon oil as a fuel,
and upon this, her first voyage as an 011
burner, she has proved its reliability be
yond a doubt. The Enterprise, which is
not a speedy craft under any circum
stances, made the trip from HITo in nine
days, and both going and returning Cap
tain Miller found the liquid fuel every
thing that had been expected.
People Interested In steam vessels nave
been watching the Enterprise experiment
with great attention. Its successful re
sult will be far reaching in Its effects and
many vessels will in consequence be con
verted into oil burners. The Oceanic
steamship Mariposa has been changed
and it will be as an oil burner that she
will replace the Australia on the Tahiti
The Enterprise brought up 57.319 bags of
sugar. After passing quarantine she
went to Oakland long wharf.

will designate a few additional deposi
tories. It is understood that further in
crease in deposits will be made after May
1, as the repeal of the war revenue act is
expected to result in a sharp increase in
the Government receipts from the begin
ning of the fiscal year, when the law will
go into operation.

The sailors who were given judgment
for $240 each against, the schooner Howe
on account of poor food supply - on the
voyage here from New York 'via Mau
ritius have now brought suits asking for
$10,000 damages. . Three more sailors have
sued for extra compensation. As a re
sult of the many libels the vessel is
likely to be abandoned to the sailors, as
the captain and owner will probably re
fuse to fight the cases any further. -
A plan Is on foot to erect memorials in
Kawaihao Church, the oldest church
here, In honor of those who took part
in laying the foundations of civilization
and Christianity In Hawaii. The me
morials are to be tablet windows. Ka
waiahao Church stands on tho site where
the Rev. Hiram Bingham preached the
first Christian sermon ever preached In
Hawaii. There is a long list of names
of the early missionary fathers and in
fluential native converts whose memories
â¢will be honored when the project is car
ried out. *

The Board of Health has made a stir
by its resolution asking Bishop Gulstan
to remove the Rev. Father "Webdelin from
the leper settlement. His associates de
mand that charges be brought against
him' and a hearing given before he is

tion is said to be that the father has
not worked in harmony with the repre
sentatives of the board.
' HONOLULU, April 17.-Judgo Hum
phreys to-day rendered a written decision
disapproving investments amounting to
$42,000 by A. W. Carter, trustee of An
nie T. K. Parker, in bonds of the Mc-
Bryde plantation, the Oahu Railway Ccm
pany and the Walalua Agricultural Com
pany, a plantation. The court holds that
the bonds are not a proper Investment
for a trustee, being too uncertain. The
trust deed provides that only a majority
of the bondholders can force foreclosure
proceedings, and the Judge stated that
this made the trustee powerless to con
trol the Investment. .The trustee Is or
dered to surcharge himself with the $42,000
invested in the bonds.

Hair, No Matter What Color.
The finest contour of a female face, the

something if the head Is crowned with
scant hair. Scant and falling hair, it : is
now. known. Is caused. by a parasite that
burrows into the scalp to" the root of the
hair, s where it saps the vitality. The little
white scales .the . germ . throws . up In bur-
rowing are called dandruff.- To cure dan-

PMNE'S CELERY
COMPOUND
Is the Only. Medicine That
Can Promptly and Per-
manently Banish All
Wasting and Dan-
gerous Dis-
vdOCut
It Restores Lost Health When
Physicians Pronounce Your
Case Incurable.
If in springtime sick peopleâ youngf and
oldâ act with promptness, wisdom and
decision suffering, agony and- misery
would never be carried into the summer
months.
To delay the work of banishing disease,
regulating the nerves, purifying the blood
and restoring perfect digestion is a se-
rious mistake.
When the blood Is sluggish, impure and
poisoned, when the nervous system is un-
balanced, when digestion is deranged and
the appetite poor and variable, be as-
sured your condition is critical and calls
for instant attention before the summer
months bring additional dangers.
At this time the use of Palne's Celery
Compound will do a marvelous work for
every run-down, sick and diseased man
and woman.
Its llf e-giving " work first commences
with the blood, which Is made clean and
pure; then the nerves are quickly set :n
order, digestive vigor Is fully restored,
the appetite Is made natural, sleep is re-
freshing and . the despondent heart 13
made light and joyous. ..;.Â¦
It is well to bear in mind that Palne's
Celery . Compound owes its origin to tha
most distinguished physician ' that this
American continent ever produced, and
his marvelous prescription is publicly in-
dorsed by our best and ablest physicians.
If all sufferers who have been disap-
pointed in ,the past win promptly start
with Paine's Celery Compound they will
be astonished and delighted with tha
speed with which this wonderful remedy
is able to call a halt to wasting and dan-
gerous diseases. It is now making tens
of thousands well and strong and fitting:
them to enjoy the summer months, wbictx
to the well and strong are pleasurabla
and happy.

Beard" of Supervisors yesterday. The
Mayor, announced that" under the charter
the thirty . days within which the resolu
tion was to be finally acted upon hati ex
pired -and it was incumbent on theboaicl
to ', take immediate action. ' Brandenstein
took the view that the Mayor was ' ex
ceeding his authority., in vetoing the
resolution.| / ; ' "'
"While". I : have upheld your course
throughout the Justices' -clerk scandal,"
said Brandenstein, addressing the Mayor,
"I take it that you have no right to ex
ercise the veto power in this matter. We
derive our authority from, the Code of
Civil Procedure and not from the charter.
Your power In the premises is not derived
from the charter, and I hold that we can
not, consider your veto. Our functions are
imposed by the State law and I make the
point of order that your veto is not prop
erly,.'before.the board because, you have
no power to veto this resolution." i. '
"While I believe, Mr. Brandenstein.
that your action will be of no effect," said
the Mayor, "in view of the fact that the
matter is now in the hands of Judge Sloss
for a decision, I am of the opinion that I
have the power of veto, and therefore I
must rule that your point of order is not
well taken." '. . ;
Brandenstein appealed from the' de
cision, but withdrew his appeal out ! of
courtesy to the Mayor, who then put the
question on whether the resolutiorV should
stand notwithstanding his veto, with the
following result:

The' social club of which O'Brien is
president and Al Neill treasurer has been
giving weekly soirees In the Temple at

revenue tax for the privilege of the bar.
When Internal Revenue Agent Burt M.

O'Brien refused to pay. and said that the
club ' was composed of young working
men and they could not afford to pay the
tax. He therefore flatly refused to pay
and was placed under arrest Much to

that his political pull could not "square"

Among the ladies who assisted in mak
ing the County Meath booth entertain
ment a success were: Mrs. A. S. Mulvey
and daughter. Miss M. Mulvey, Miss Nel
lie Mulvey, Miss Maud Pettee, Miss Alice
Hoyt, Miss M. Flynn, Miss B. Callahan
Mrs. Mary McGuire, Mrs. A. Crawford
and Mrs. Mary McCue.
A delightful entertainment in aid of the
Meath booth was given last night at the
residence of Mrs. A. S. Mulvey, 1112 Lar
kin street. The ladies who have charge
of this booth arje working incessantly to
make their part of the Irish Fair worthy
of the famed hospitality of County Meath.
If they sustain their part in the fair as
pleasantly as they did last night they
will certainly succeed. The programme
consisted of vocal and instrumental mu
sic, after which refreshments were
served.
Both sides of the Pavilion are to be
lined with representations of castles,
towers and churches. Not a bit of the in
side of the Pavilion will be visible. In the
castles and towers, which will be used us
booths, will be displayed all manner of
pretty and interesting articles. Each
county of Ireland will De allowed a booth
for the display of its resources. The peo
ple of the various counties are making
great arrangements for tbe festival, and
for months past have been raising money
with which to provide their exhibit. Prob
ably not in many years have the Irish
people taken such interest in a fiesta as
they are displaying in the approaching
Irish Fair.
From the work already accomplished,
the fair promises to eclipse anything of
its kind ever gfven in this State. The St%
Lawrence Gate, through which the people
will enter. Is already in place. It stands
directly in front of the main doors of the
Pavilion, and by itself presents a very
suggestive picture. At night, when the
lights are burning, one can almost be de
ceived into believing that the gate with
huge towers on either side is as real as
was its famous original in the days of
chivalry.
The interior of Mechanics' Pavilion,
where preparations for the Irish Fair are
being rushed to completion, presents a
very animated seene. The great festival
is to be opened on Mayday, and before
that time a great amount of work must
be done. It is not the work of a day to
construct miniature castles and towers in
the likeness of the historical ruins of Ire
land. But the work is rapidly progress
ing, and when the hour comes to open the
great fair all the decorations and all the
exhibits will be in place and Mechanics'
Pavilion will present a scene that will not
soon be forgotten.

Mrs. D. Arnold, President German
Woman's Club, Grand Pacific Hotel, Los
Angeles, Gal., Relieved of a Tumor by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
Â« Dear Mrs. Pinkham : âI suffered four years ago with a tumor
in'my womb, and the doctors declared I must go to the hospital and un-
dergo an operation, which I dreaded very much and hesitated to submit.
"My husband consulted an old friend who had studied medicine,
although he was not a practising physician, and he said he believed
that Lydia E. Pinkiam's Vegetable Compound would cure
me.' That same day I took my first dose, and I kept it up faithfully
until twelve bottles had been used, and not only did the tumor dis-
appear, but my general health was very much improved and I had
not felt so well since I was a young woman.
"As I have suffered no relapse since, and as I took no. other med-
icine, I am sure that your Compound restored my health and I believe
saved my life." â Mrs. D. Arnold.
$5000 FORFEIT IF THE ABOVE IiETTEK IS NOT GENUINE.
"When women are troubled with irregular, suppressed or painful
menstruation, weakness, leucorrhcea, displacement or ulceration of the
womb, that bearing-down feeling, inflammation of the ovanes, backache,
bloating (or flatulence), general debility, indigestion, and nervous pros-
tration, or are beset with such symptoms as dizziness, f aintness, lassitude,
excitability, irritability, nervousness, sleeplessness, melancholy, "all-
gone," and "want-to-be-left-alone" feelings, blues, and hopelessness,
they should remember there is one tried and true remedy. Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles.
Refuse to buy any other medicine, for you np*^ t^ n best. A r .l .*'

former husband brought against" her pres
ent husband In San Francisco until she
arrived here to-day. She appeared to be
amused and said: "I married Â¦ Lyons
when'I was only 16 years of age. I lived
with him, twelve years and practically" had
to make a living for us both all the time.
I was forced to leave him and . he has
sought in every possible way to make my
life miserable since. He has written me
repeatedly asking me for sums of money.
He has also written Mr. Crellin. Once he
wanted- $500 and another -time $600, and
sometimes he failed to state the amount,
but just wanted money. He also wrote
Mr. Crellln ; that unless he gave him a sum
of money he would publish the history of
his life and disgrace every one with whom
his name was connected.* His implication
waa that he would disgrace Mr. Crellin
and myself. : I have only been married to
Mr. Crellin eighteen months. When I
left Lyons I did not know that Mr. Crel
lin existed. How Mr. Crellin could have
alienated my affections during the time
I lived with Lyons is a mystery.. Lyons
did , not place much of a price on my
affections while we were living -. together.
Mr, Crellin can afford to give Lyons what
he desires if he . cares to, and I suppose
Lyons needs the money."

was quiet. The doctor thinks the pa
tient was seized with a fit of epilepsy and
fell upon the lighted oil stove. When Miss
Jones broke through the wall of smoke
the fire was under such headway that the
second-story floor was ablaze. Bray's
body could hardly be seen through the
black, suffocating smoke. But the heroic
woman rushed through, got the helpless,
unconscious form in her arms and
dragged her burden to a place of safety.
Meanwhile the whole force of attend
ants had been alarmed. Miss Lena Smith,
an assistant in the dining-room, seized
the fire alarm box key and rushed to the
box at Twelfth and Madison streets.- i
The disaster threatened the , lives of
twcv-score helpless Inmates of the institu
tion, who were Baved only by the heroic,
cool-headed efforts of Miss Jones and the
women nurses and helpers of the home.
To them, as well as to the efficient ser
vices of the Fire Department, under Chief
Engineer N. A. Ball, is due the salvation
of many lives and the main building.

The firemen worked to keep the fire

decision was rendered only covers last

President Ban Johnson of the American
League and other witnesses were called
to prove that neither Bernhard nor Fra

but the court decided that the decision of
the Supreme Court applied to them and
accordingly issued the . permanent re
straining order.
The court decided In the case of Lajoie
that there were no new points to be ar
gued and that as the Supreme Court had
expressly declared Lajoie's contract to be
valid, a permanent injunction must be
issued. Counsel for the American League
Club argued that the constitution of the
National League was in violation of the
Sherman anti-trust law, as it retained the
players' sen-ices for all - time, but the
court did not agree with that view.

STOCKTON, April 2S.â William Odum, a
young man well connected in Illinois, died
In the County Hospital at French Camp
last week. He lost his health in the Phil
ippines, and on being informed that he
could not live requested a fellow patient
known as Kelley to send a letter to his
bister, living near Peoria, 111. The letter
â¢was not written until a day or two before
Odum's death, and when Mrs. Holladay,
the sister, received it she started at once
for this place. Arriving here, she found
that the brother had been dead two days.
The letter she received had been signed
"Edw. J. Oneal," and she was surprised
to find that no such person had- been in
the hospital. â¢' - - ...
An Investigation showed that several
inmates of the ward had heard Odum re
quest Kelley to write for him. They saw
him give Kelley a package of
some appearing to be in legal form. Kel
ley did not write until those who had
heard the request insisted that he do so.
Evidently he wrote under the name of
Oneal. Kelley disappeared the day before
Odum died. J
As Odum had been doing business with
the commissary department of the army
In the islands it is -believed that he left

The Lawtons were perfectly happy In
a pretty home on High street In Alameda
until the mistress of it contracted the
stage fever. She is comely and can touch
high G with her sweet soprano voice that
has been heard at many Alameda society
affairs, and she could see nothing but
success. For awhile she concealed her
intentions from, her husband and visited
the Tivoli secretly. Then at last she
made the leap.
One night the husband came home to
find a note telling him his wife would stay
In the city with friends. But she stayed
several days, and in the end, of course,
there came the denouement. She told him
frankly that she was tired of washing
dishes and that she was going on the
tit-ge for sood.
Lawton has sold all the furniture and
gone to boarding.
Mrs. Julia Lawton, late of Alameda, but
later of the Tivoll chorus, is free to dance

The wild desire she entertains to become
a comic opera star has nothing to stifle
it now, for to-day her husband, Lewis
Lawton, was granted a divorce from her
on the ground of cruelty.

The Court Commissionership Is deemed
one of the most lucrative appointive . of
fices in the gift of the county. It Is a fee
office that yields about $150 a month to
the bolder.
Colonel Babcock formerly held a posi
tion in the San Francisco Mint, which he
lost through the change of administra
tion. He will be restored to that place.
Colonel Babcock's resignation is to take
effect on April 30. Judges Greene, Ells
worth, Ogden, Hall and.Melvlri are to
meet to-morrow and appoint his succes
sor, who will be Clarence Crowell, chair
man of the Republican County Central
Committee. Babcock's resignation has
been rumored for some time and it has
been generally understood that Crowell
would get the position.
The present Commissioner's term began
in May, 18S3. During his seven years In
the office he has heard more than 700 di
vorce cases that were referred to him.
Colonel George C. Babcock wound up a
seven years' administration of the Court
Commissioner's office to-day by present
ing his resignation to the Superior Judges
of this county, with whom rests the
power of giving away that political sine

Track Notes.
SALT LAKE, Utah, April 26.â The
scheduled twenty-round contest between
Phil' Green of Salt Lake and young. Dono
van of Los Angeles at the Salt Lake Ath
letic Club to-night ended in a row in the
fifteenth round that almost developed into
a free fight. Green, handicapped Â¦ in
height and reach and eight pounds lighter
than the California boy, forced the fight
ing for the first twelve rounds. In the
thirteenth Donovan made - Green groggy
with a succession of hard lefts to the jaw
and forced the fighting In the fourteenth.
Green went down for seven seconds! from
a right to the jaw,- and an' instant later
got the same dose. He went 'down, ap
parently out, but got up just at the count
of ten. His seconds, however, had thrown
the. sponge into the ring and Chief of Po
lice Hilton i motioned* Referee .Tom Ben
nett to stop the fight. Bennett, not seeing
the sponge, declared the fight' a draw on
its merits: and on; account of stopping of
it by the police. In - an instant the ring
was full of howling, maddened men, sev
eral of whom threatened the referee.
Bennett taking umbrage at some remark,"
let fly. his right at the offender, and the
two had a merry, set-to before the police
stopped , this fight also. â¢ -.,Â¦-Â¦Â¦

BAKERSFIELD, April 28.â The Union
Gun Club of this city has decided to give
a two days* shooting tournament dur
ing carnival week, open to all comers.
Cash and merchandise -prizes will be
awarded for rifle, shotgun, pistol and re
volver. May 7 will be for live birds and
May 8 for Wuerocks. Fifteen hundred
pigeons and 10,000 bluerocks have been
procured.
Gawaine, a 10 to 1 shot, piloted by John
ny Hoar, slipped away from his field' at
the start of the final mile and fifty-yard
run, and was never headed. First Shot
ran second, a length before the favorite,
Frank Woods.
"Peach" Honig's mare Antolee repeated
her excellent performance of Saturday
last, defeating Rio Shannon a neck for
the mile and a sixteenth selling number.
The last named horse, with Jimmy Boze
man in the saddle, made most of the run
ning and seems out of luck. Princess Ti
tania. the post favorite, ran a good third,
although the route is undoubtedly not to
her liking. Probably old Wfolhurst found
the track too hard, for Troxler could not
land him among the first three.
There was nothing capable of giving the
favorite, Lizzie Rice, an argument in the
two-year-old scramble. Guida made a
very fair, showing, finishing second, beat

forte. TbÂ« daughter of Royal Flush car
ried 107 pounds in the Fieldwick handi
cap, at seven furlongs, and waited behind
Hagerdon until the wire was in Bight,
edged her way past the Cameron entry
and won by a length in 1:26%. Dlvina,
the heavily played 2 to 1 choice, appeared
outfooted the first three-quarters, finish
ing third all out. It was a rattling good
betting affair, Meehanus, Escalante and
Solinus all being accorded support. The
winner went to the post at odds of 7 to L
Favorites met with more or less ill rac
ing luck almost from the start, only two,
Algareta and Lizzie Rice, falling heir to
brackets.
Algareta. owned by the Montana turf
rcan, J. A- Murphy, took the opening
sprint, starting a pronounced favorite.
Spargur waited with the old mare until
the stretch was reached, when he went to
the front, scoring easily from Bogus Bill
and Catherine. Amasa gave it up* after
cutting out the pace for a time. . - â¢ -Â¦%-"-*
Those who threw out the previous bad
race of Nonie reaped the benefit of the
filly's clever win of the five-furlong dash.
She was well handled by See, who gradu

WILD PITCHING CAUSES
DEFEAT OF BOSTON TEAMS
WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS
IN QUARTERLY SESSION
Joe Walcott and George Gardiner may
battle to a finish in Nevada early in July.
S. Livingston, a well known sporting man
of Carson, has expressed a Â¦willingness to
match the men and guarantee them $5000
if they will sign articles. Livingston sent
the following telegram to Harry Corbett
yesterday:
"Will guarantee Walcott-Gardner JjOOO
for a finish nght in Nevada early in
July."
George Gardner and his manager. Alec
Greggatns, were shown the dispatch and
both men said they would accept the -of
fer. Greggains stated he would put up
a forfeit with Harry Corbett as an evi
dence of his good intentions. Gardner
announced that he would like nothing
better than to meet his erstwhile op
ponent to a finish. He said the longer he
fought the better he showed and he had
every faith in his ability to beat the
colored boxer. Oardner said he would
rather fight Jack Root under the same
conditions and if Walcott will not accept
he hopes Manager Livingston will be able
to arrange such a match.
Such a contest would be of greater in
terest than one with Walcott. Root was
given a decision over Gardner on a foul
and the latter is anxious to retrieve this
unfortunate contest. He says a contest
between himself and Root would be a
championship event and would settle for
all time who is entitled to be the light
heavvweight champion of the world.
\Va*!cott left for the East last Sunday
night.
Jimmy Britt will start training at
Croll's "Gardens, Alameda, to-day for his
contest with "Kid" Lavigne. They are
to box twenty rounds on May 29 under
the ausDices of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club. Britt will have "Spider" Kel
ly to look after him. Lavigne and Britt
will battle for the lS3-pound champion
ship cf the world. When Lavigne lost
to Frank Erne the last named weighed
136% pounds. The "Kid" had to give
weight to Erne, and despite this fact
Krne only won the chompionship on
points. Lavigne claims he is better now
than he ever was. He has taken excel
lent care of himself for more than a year
and a half. Lavigne is working at
Blanken's. He has "Kid" Parker for a
training mate.
To-morrow evening: the San Francisco
Athletic Club will hold its regular month
ly exhibition. Joe Angeli and William
Brodie will appear in the main event.
They will box fcur rounds at 128 pounds.
The balance of the card follows:
John Crow, S. F. A. C. vs. Ernest Parker,
S. F. A. C. 105 pounds, four rounds; William
Tardelli. unattached, vs. Mike ilaher. Key
- Ftone A. C. 105 pounds, four rounds; George
Haniey, S. F. A. C. vs. Joe Carroll, S. F. A.

S. V. A. C. vs. Harry Klllen. B. C. A. C, 118

vs. James Adams. S. F. A. C, 120 pounds,
â¢four rounds; Ed Devine. unattached, vs. Fred
Landers, S. F. A. C. 125 pounds, four rounds.
Manager Money made a great mistake
tn. letting the Buffalo team take Atherton
from him. The big fellow was probably
the best man on the team. He could play
almost any position and was hitting hard
er than any player in the league.
"A left-handed pitcher, with good con
trol can keep the Los Angeles team guess
ing as long as he keeps cool," remarked
Meredith yesterday. He probably speaks
from experience, as he shut out the Ser
aphs last Saturday, and they never had
a chance to hit him safely.
Pete Dowliig should take a lesson from
Sunday's game. Rough tactics might
possibly do in Milwaukee, but not in San
Francisco, especially when Jack O Connell
is looking. ' ' â¢ Â¦ Â¦'Â¦
Los Angeles pitchers hold the records
so far. McPartlin shut Oakland out with
out a safe hit, and Rube Waddell struck
out nine of the local batsmen. Both are
good marks for the other pitchers to
overcome. . ,- , . - '
Glendon will be seen in the box 'or the
Ponies this week. He arrived from Cin
cinnati a few days ago. He is a big,
husky fellow, and a first-class box artist.
Fielding his position is his long suit.
Mike Fisher is going to have a bulletin
board on the Sacramento grounds and will
announce the games in San Francisco and
Los Angeles by innings. This is a good
idea, and the other managers should fol
low suit.- ' _
Jim McDonald will umpire at Recrea
tion Park this week, while Jack O'Connell
does a few stunts at Sacramento. Mc-
Donald failed to satisfy the Los Angeles
public. - His umpiring was undoubtedly
good, but still the knockers were after.
him. 1 Â¦ Â¦' â¢
Last week's, series of games failed to
alter the standing: of any of the four clubs
of the league. The coming- series should
give San Francisco and Sacramento a
chance to regain some lost ground. Both
will play on their home grounds and this
is a big advantage for any ball nine. Los
Angeles always, does much better when
in the south, so the Ponies should cap
ture the series if they put up any kind of
a game. ,Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦
billy Hulen will have entire charge of
the benators while in the Held, iluien is
well known in the baseball world, having
played in different cities of the State ana
Middle We3t. His ilrst prof essional . ex
perience was gained with the . Los An
geles team in 1S&2. â¢ ' v
The Ponies, accompanied by Manager
Harris, arrived yesterday, morning from
Los Angeles. Though they lost the series,
they are not disheartened and all agree
that the Angels got a good run for tneir
money.
Catcher Gorton was fined $5 by Manager
Pete Lohman for not running to first on
an easy grounder in last Sunday morn
ing's game at Oakland. Gorton hit the
ball easy to Eagan, who threw badly to
first, and the runner could have made
second on it had he tried. v

IT'S FUNNY how so many men act.
; They toll, and labor, and struggle,
AND NEVER for a moment think of
rest, or recreation, or pleasure.
AND HOW FOOLISH for those resid-
ing In this vicinity, when right at their
door lies the playground, quickly and
' cheaply reached.
IP YOTJ WHiTj NOT occasionally give
up the daily grind,
DO NOT make your wife and children
continually walk the treadmill,
AT LEAST give them a chance for a
â¢ little change of air that will bring some
color to their cheeks.
PERHAPS then you" will, find time to
visit them over Sunday,
AND FORGET, yourself as your chil-
dren poke grass down your ; neck,

V DB JOBDO'ACO.. 1051 Market St.. S. P. VThe week opened on a weak Butter market,
and while -there was j no pronounced decline
close buyers could fill their .wants at . small
concessions from the quotations ruling- last
week. For the finest creameries 20o is now a
price more or less difficult to obtain, though
it is .still being realized in a email way. As
previously' mentioned the commission merchants
have begun to pack, though against their will,
being forced to this course by. the steadily ac
cumulating stocks. . Receipts are | still heavy,
as will be seen. - Â¦
Cheese remains as before, there being plenty
here for all current needs. . " . , â¢
The situation in Eggs remains the same.
There are large -lines of common and inferior
ranch on the market, and they are slow of sale,,
but real large- fine ranch are not overplentlfui
and are quoted very, steady and even firm at
the recent advance. - The exchange advanced
quotations to 14@16c for ranch, leaving Â¦ store
unchanged at 13@14c per dozen.
'Receipts were 75,100 pounds, 4 bbls "and 215
tubs of Butter, 1652 cases of Eggs, 400 cases
of Eastern Eggs, 21,700 pounds of California
Cheese and pounds of Eastern Cheese.
BUTTER â Creamery, 19c and occasionally
20c per pound for fancy, 18@18%c for firsts
and 17 %c for. seconds; dairy, 16@18c; store But
ter, 14@15c per- pound.
' CHEESK â New, 9@>10c; - old, 9@llc;' Young
America. 8@10c; Eastern, 13@15c per pound. -
EGGS â Raneh, 16%@17c for fancy and 14Â®
15c for. fair to good; store, 12%@14c per dozen.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Mallnda Strawberries were very green and
muddy and sold slowly in consequence. Long
worths Â¦ from Palo Alto, were In fair condition,
but' those from the river were jpoor and sold
at the. bottom quotation. Receipts were 73
chests Longworths, 55 chests and 63 crates of
Mailndas. .
. Small sizes of fancy Oranges continued to
sell well, both on the street and at the auc
tion, but large sizes were dull, and In the
open market some dealers were obliged to
shade -prices In order' to effect sales. At the
auction 7 cars were sold as follows : Fancy
Navels, $1 70@3; choice do, $1 25@2 55; stand
ards, (irÂ»c(-j($ 1.90; standard Seedlings. 70c@$l.
Lemons show no improvement and supplies are
continually stacking up. .Mexican .Limes were
quoted higher, as stocks were lessened consider
ably by the filling of back orders.

The are for good sound
NEW YORK, Aprif 28.â Speculative interest
In etocks shared a considerable falling off to
day and the full day's transactions - reached a
million shares for the first time in two weeks.
The feverish activity which has characterized
the recent leadership of the market was decid
edly lacking. If the rather large dealings in
Reading be excepted. The tone of the market
was halting and uncertain and the movement
of prices was not uniform. The predominant
movement, while it failed to embrace the whole
list, itself changed a number of times during
the day. The failure of the conference of the
anthracite miners and operators to agree upon
terms on Saturday was a disappointment, and
the tcne of the comment of the parties to the
conference created a disagreeable impression.
The result was free selling of Reading in the
opening dealings, which affected the whole
market. This weakness was overcome by
strong advances In eome of the high-priced
coalers. The part played In the market by the
high-priced etocks. of which the floating supply
Is very email, was notable and their wide
movements resulted from a light volume of
trading. As the upward flight of Delaware and
Hudson and of New Jersey Central rallied the
Eeadtngs, so did the spurt In the Chicago and
Northwestern stocks give eome strength to the
grangers and Pacifies. St. Paul was lifted 2
points over last night and there were gains of
one to two points amongst the Southwesterns.
The gains were not well held, however, and
there were constant relapses when the market
Â«Â«t allowed to become quiet. New York, New
Haven and Hartford was another of the high
stocks to more, but it saved only a point of
Its seven-point advance. Among the Indus
trials there were wide advances in Pullman.
International Power, American Express and
Pressed Steel Car preferred. Reports of rail
road earnings received during the day were
generally favorable and Included net earnings
Tor March of a number 'of systems. Colorado
Fuel and Tennessee Coal were bid ' up late In
the day as the local tractions bad been earlier,
but relapsed again without much effect en the
general market. The varying movement In the
grain market was reflected' from time to time
in the stock market, but not In a decisive way.
The-usually active industrials were 'quite gen
erally heavy. The reduction in the Calumet
and Hecla dividend depressed Amalgamated
Copper; Bugar was affected by lower, prices
for the refined product; Unlfed States Steel
seemed to reflect disapproval of the bond Issue
and United States ' Leather was affected by
realizing. The firmness of foreign exchange
reawakened discussion of probable gold exports,
but the money market was unaffected. ', ( The
market closed dull and easy. . ','Â¦'Â¦
The bond market was moderately active and
strong. Total sales, $4,045,000 ..
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. '.

CHICAGO, April 28. â Trade in wheat to-day
was only fairly active, 'though the frequent
chailge of the speculators made the tension
somewhat marked. . At the opening news of
general rains in all the principal wheat States
except Kansas started wheat; At .a. liberal de
cline from ; (Saturday's closing , '.prices.'..; The
Southwest' sold liberally and; helped hold prices
back. The situation for eome time seemed to
favor the bulls. Cables were higher, "primary
receipts were Â¦ still light, showing rapidly, de
creasing stocks, and the Northwest "bought well
of cash stuff and started an advance, July ris
ing to 76%c. after opening %@%c lower- at
76%@75?ic. When reports of more -liberal
offerings m the Northwest and of rains In Kan
sas arrived, selling became general and Â¦ July
BteadHy declined to 75c. The close was weak,
l@l%c lower,- at 75 %c. ' Â¦Â¦â¢-â¢.
Trade in corn hinged on the action of the
leading bull crowd. Influential buying pre
vented this cereal from following the course
of wheat, when that market broke. July
closed fairly firm, %c down, at 63%c.
Interest in May oats relieved the monotony
of a quiet market and helped uphold the other
options. There was a disposition to keep out
of the market until the possibility of a corner
in May was- past. Closed firm, %c up, at
42%c for May. July (new) closed %&%c lower
at 87c - â¢ \
The provisions : market was manipulated
again by packers to-day for higher prices. But
I on the whole most of the early gain was lost.
i July pork closed 2%c lower; lard 2%e up and
July ribs a shade higher.

WHEATâ The English and French markets
were steady to firm, cargoes on passage being
quiet. The world's, shipments for the 'week
were as follows, in quarters: Russian, 220.
000; Danublan, 102,000; Argentine, 170,000; In
dian, 23.000. - --. . . .;
The American visible supply â¢ decreased
3,833,000 bushels.' The Chicago market opened
tame and easier and declined lc. The weather
was cloudy with showers In the Southwest and
good rains in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys.
The rains have completely changed the aspect
of the crop during the past week and it Is now
said that all danger to the crop is past. Kan
sas, however, has suffered, irreparably, and the
president of the Kansas Grain Dealers' Asso
ciation says that the â¢ State cannot raise over
30,000,000 bu3hels. and- that ' the ' growth is
small. There is also a large decrease in acre
age In the Northwest, and a heavy miller wires
that the Red River Valley will decrease one
third. The Chicaso decline. was due to local
stop-order selling and a bear raid at St. Louis.

BARLEYâ The market showed very little
change. : The railroad rate of 50c per ctl from
California terminals to : Eastern points, expir
ing May 1, was extended to run through , the
whole month of May, and this" affords an op
portunity for additional shipments to the East.
There is a fair demand in the interior for this
account, but the local market continues quiet.

The United States Naval ; Academy is
given $500,000 to carry on the plan of-im
provement. ; The committee calls atten
tion, to the lack of officers sufficient to
officer the new ships and to fill this de
mand additional cadets at the academy
are provided for, 125 each year during the
next four, years. ;
Each' Senator, member and delegate of
the House of Reprsentatlves is to have
the appointment of one and the President
twenty-four, these being allotted during
the period of four , years. An additional
sum of $229,905 is provided for the civil
administration of : the Naval Academy.
Under the steam engineering and v con
struction bureau's extensive improvements
are to be made in their respective plants
at Boston, New York, Norfolk, League
Island, Puset Sound and other points.
The bill carries $2,938,465 for the Marine
Corps. . . Â¦ â¢
Other Interesting features of the bill are
provisions for a board of naval officials
to recommend a site for a naval station
at some point on the- Great Lakes;: an
Increase of the. enlisted force of the navy
byÂ«3000 men; provisions for a new navy
ration as reported. by a naval board; an
increase in the number of cadets at the
academy by 500. ; - ' Â¦'Â¦ , Â¦â¢ Â¦ . }<
The detailed statement shows that the

The naval training station- at California
receives $30,000; -at Rhode Island. $55,000;
naval home, Philadelphia, $76,000; naval
war college, $14,246. For armor and arma
ment the bill provides $4,000,000. This 13
considerably above the estimates, owing
to the rapidity .with which the armor ma
kers are turning out their product. Im
portant items under the . Bureau of Ord
nance are: 'Â¦...'

tion at San ~ Juan, Porto Rico, to cost

RECOMMENDS &EW SHIPS.
Concerning new ships for our navy, the
report says:
The committee recommends that for the pur
pose of further increasing the naval establish
ment of the United States the President shall
have constructed two first-class battleships,
carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful
ordnance for vessels of their class upon a trial
displacement of about 16,000 tons, and to have
the highest practicable speed and* greatest
radius of action, and to cost, exclusive - of
armor and armament, not exceeding $4,212,000
each: two tirst-class armored cruisers of about
14,500 ton* trial displacement, to cost, exclu
sive of armor and armament, not exceeding
$4,659,000 each, and two gunboats of about
1000 tons trial displacement. In view of ' the
fact that there Is some public sentiment favor
able to the building in our Government navy
yards. It has been deemed' advisable by this
committee to Insert a provision in the appro
priation bill this year leaving it to the discre
tion of the Secretary of the Navy to build any
or all shirs in Government yards, but mak
ing it mandatory on him to construct at least
one battleship or one armored cruiser in such
navy-yard as he may designate . as an experi
ment, and it is further provided that he shall
keep an account of all expenditures for labor
and material in the inspection and construc
tion of such ships, and report to Coneress at
each session, and on the completion of said
ships he shall make a detailed report showing
the relative cost of one built by the Govern
ment and one built by contract. It i3 believed
by your committee that nothing short of an
experiment of this kind will show whether pri
vate contractors have been reasonable In their
bids and serve for the future guidance in the
construction of our navy. An appropriation of
$175,000 Is recommended for each yard in
which a ship Is built. \
The complete cost of the two first-^lass bat
tleships, two first-class armored cruisers and
two gunboats, with a total tonnage of 63,000
tona, will approximate $29,500,000. These bat
tleships and cruisers will be larger than any
heretofore â¢ authorised by- Congress, and the
plans recommended by the board of construc
tion already have excited the favorable com
ment of the naval" authorities abroad. ' The
committee â¢ is - of -the opinion that -in-recom
mending the above naval programme it Is mak
ing a nubstantlal and healthy Increase In our
navy and one which will meet everywhere with
popular favor. ; . .. â â¢ ' /.-
WASHINGTON, April 28.â The naval
programme of 1903, as presented In the na
val appropriation bill arid the report filed
to-day by Chairman Foss of the House
Naval Committee, is one of unusual inter
est.. The report does not take as optimistic
a 'view- of our naval progress aa is gen
erally held, and Foss points out that com-:
paratively few of our ship's have, any real
fighting value. He accompanies this with
a statement N of the enormous naval ar
mament and progress of other countries,
particularly Germany. It Is shpwn by
the report that the total number of vessels
of our navy, built and building, is 138, and
the total cost will be ?235,082,Â»)9. The re
port adds:.
i While we have i built and are bulldine all
told 138 ships, yet comparatively few of them
have any real fighting value. Our naval
rrowesj lies almost entirely in our eighteen
battleships, eight armored cruisers and twenty
cne Drotected cruisers. The rest of our' ships
would cut but little figure in actual war. Ships
of the battle line practically alone contain the
naval strength of the nation. -_":;
Referring 1 to the naval programmes, the'
report says:
Of all the countries German has been build
ing during the last few years faster than any
of the others. Her ship-bulldlng programme
started in 1898 and will be completed In 1908,
possibly In 1907. Instead of I'jio. as at first
planned. This programme will give her in all
thirty-eight battleships, fourteen large cruis
ers, thirty-eight smaller cruisers and- ninety
six torpedo boats. After the completion of this
programme the plan contemplates new con
structions to replace ships which, though still
serviceable, may have reached the prescribed
age limit, j

, The meeting of the Pacific Amateur
Athletic Association last evening wa3 a
torrid one. ' All the delegates from the
various amateur organizations expecteu
an exciting session and came prepared.
At the very outset the Bay City Athletic
Club made a strenuous effort to be re
stored to full amateur standing in order
to bring off Its regular monthly boxing
contests, but the committee declined the
peaceful and contrite overtures of the
management of the club. The matter was
voted upon and lost. Further action wa3
then deferred until next meeting. In^the
meantime the Bay City Athletic Club
must sit by and watch rival organizations
bring off contests. . \.
A heated discussion was had over a fine
Imposed on the Ariel Rowing Club by the
registration committee. It appears that
the boat club gave a boxing exhibition
last month for the benefit of its boat
house fund. Among the men who ap
peared In the ring was a husky lighter
named Green. The latter was not an
amateur and should not have been al
lowed to go on. but the club risked a fine
by allowing him to fill an aching void.
Chairman George James of the registra
tion committee imposed a fine of $25 on
the Ariels and last night T. J. Lynch, a
member of the organization who repre
sents the boat club in the association,
came, primed with a long speech full or
apologies, explanations and statements.
James and Huber Hauser took umbrage
at some of his remarks. Upon motion of
Delegate Cadogan of the Reliance Ath
letic Club, seconded by Charles Eickert.
representing Stanford University, the
registration committee's action was up
held. Chairman James was satisfied. In
one of his speeches he intimated that he
would ask to have the committee dis
banded if its action was not upheld.
Rather than have such a valuable com
mittee turned down the delegates voted
almost unanimously in favor of the Ariel
Club paying the fine. . Mr. Lynch gave
notice of an appeal to the Amateur Ath
letic Union.
Upon motion made by Mr. James $25
was voted to the University of California
track team, which leaves for the East
next Thursday. Two new athletic clubs â
the Observatory and the California, ap
plied for recognition by the association.
The matter was referred to the commit
tee on membership.

The marriage of Huff and Miss Gold
stein was performed by Justice of the
Peace Daniels on December 23 of last
year. It was the windup of a holiday de
bauch, and it certainly was a warm fin
ish. - A half-hour after Huff and Miss
Goldstein had been made one at the City
Hall they were confronted by an- irate
woman looking for a lost husband. A few
words from her and Huff slunk away,
and the truth came out. The irate woman
was. Mrs. Huff No. 1, and she very quick
ly informed Mrs. Huff, No. 2 that Huff
had never been divorced from 'her and
consequently -had-no right to take unto*
himself a second bride.
The fact that he was drunk was the
only excuse offered by Huff, and as Miss
Goldstein could give no reason \why she
gav& her consent to the ceremony other
than that Huff represented he was a di
vorced man, Judge Kerrigan annulled the
marriage.
So. said Walter R. Huff yesterday when
Judge Kerrigan asked him why he mar
ried May Blanche Goldstein when he had
a wife living.
"I was drunlr, your Honor, and I did
not know, what I was doing."

Lieutenant Colonel John W. Bubb' fol

occurred on November. 11, 1S99, at 4 Bam-,

with the hope of making it" impregnable;
but which the American '. troops : under
Colonels J. H. Smith, -Seventeenth In

regiment entered Tarlac November 13,
1S99. The insurgent army was now. rout
ed, demoralized and widely scattered and
never again was able to take the field as
an organized army. For a time the war
seemed at an end, but the long and la
borious campaign against the guerrilla
bands of the Insurgent Generals Alejan
drino, Macabolus, Aklno, Tecson and oth
ers was yet to follow. It is impracticable
to enumerate here the expeditions : and
minor engagements in which various de
tachments of the regiment hunted" down
fought, dispersed and captured these
guerrilla bands in Tarlac province. The
history of the pacification, the military

troops marched all day through the rice
paddies and caneflelds. The men much of
the time were up to their knees in mud
and water, but they steadily pushed
ahead, without a murmur, fighting the re
treating insurgents, who made brief
stands behind the various defensive posi
tions which, with infinite' labor and care,
they had prepared for. the undoing of the
American army. At the battle of An
geles, August 16, 1839, the regiment ' ac
complished, a brilliant victory, farreach
ing in its results. General Wheaton on
that day sent ten companies of â¢ the regi
ment and Lieutenant Kenly with two field
guns, all under command of Lieutenant
Colonel J. H. Smith, Twelfth Infantry, to
make a reconnoissance. in the direction of
the important railroad town of Angeles.
Colonel- Smith found the. insurgents
strongly Intrenched in the bamboo thick
ets surrounding the town, I their large
force completely covering the railroad
embankment, the country roads and the
open paddy fields, which formed the ap
proaches to the place; but, nothing daunt
ed, he made a direct assault and-com
pletely routed the insurgents. The latter
largely outnumbered the Twelfth Infantry
and had the advantage of a strong "nat
ural position^ protected by a. long line â¢ of
trenches. On account of impracticable
roads and meager transportation the regi
ment was compelled to maintain alone for
some weeks the advanced position at An
geles. The insurgents, with increased
numbers, returned, constantly- threatened
and on several occasions attacked' the
place, but on Â¦ every- occasion - they were
driven off with heavy loss.' . Aguinaldo's

Shortly after this campaign the entire
regiment was sent to San Fernando,
Pampanga, and assigned to General Fun-
ston's brigade of General MacArthur's di
vision, then facing Aguinaldo's main army
on the northern line. Fatiguing outpost
duty, almost dally outpost firing, with fre
quent night' attacks by the insurgents,
the withdrawal of the State Volunteers,
high water (it rained heavily without a
break for four days and nights at one
time), fevers and other sickness were fea
tures of this period of the campaign.
The army resumed the advance August
9, 1899, a day memorable In the annals of
the campaign. Under a burning sun the
SENT TO SAN FERNANDO.
Under the command of Lieutenant Col
onel (now Brigadier General) Jacob H.
Smith, Twelfth Infantry, the regiment
and a part of the Seventeenth Infantry
sailed from New York, February 19 1S93,
in the transport Sheridan for Manila.
Â« h:le en rout* the transport touched at
Malta. Through the -courtesy of the Gov
ernor General, Sir Henry Grenfel, the
troops were landed for exercise and re
viewed by the Governor General and the
commanding general of the garrison. The
Britsh officers and the sailors and soldiers
vied with each other in enowing social at
tentions to the visiting troops, making the
occasion one of great interest and pleas
ure to all concerned and an international
episode of marked freindly significance.
On arrival in Manila part of the regi
ment was assigned for a time to provost
guard duty, but the First and Second bat
talions were soon facing the insurgent
trenches on the south line, and from that
time until the insurrection was completely
suppressed in Northern Luzon the regi
ment participated in the active operations
against the insurgent forces. Major Has
kell, with Companies E, G, H and I. took
a. prominent part in the fight at Cainta
and Taytay, June 3 and 4, 1899, and the
subsequent campaign under General Hall
In the province of Morong. On June 10 six
companies of the regiment were in the
command with which General Lawton
forced the enemy's south line through
Paranaque and Las Pinas to the Zapote
River. At the bridge over this river on
June 13, 1809, he engaged the insurgents
at close range in one of the fiercest fights
of the war. Companies L and M, Twelfth
Infantry, under command of Captains C.
H. Barth and Robert L. Hirst, took a con
epicuous and gallant part in this fight.
After the engagement the bodies of more
than 100 insurgents were found in the
trenches, from which, less than seventy
five yards away, they had withstood for
a time the onslaught of the Americans.
Lieutenant J. P. Harbeson was here
Â¦wounded, and quite recently he has been
nominated for the brevet commission of
captain for distinguished gallantry in the
engagement.
Xo single regiment played a more gal
lant and successful part in the Santiago
campaign than the Twelfth Infantry.
Lieutenant Colonel Comba, promoted to
the. rank of colonel during the campaign,
was soon afterward appointed brigadier
general of volunteers for distinguished
services at Santiago. Captains H. L.
Haskell, Robert K. Evans, Millard F.
Waltz, Palmer G. Wood and Wallis O.
Clark were nominated by the President
for the brevet rank of major, and Lieu
tenants W. E. Dove. Willis Uline and
Frank L. Winn for that of captain for
gallantry at El Caney.
Along with the other troops, the regi
ment suffered terribly from Cuban fever,
and on its return to the United States
was sent to Montauk Point. Later it was
stationed at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri,
where it was recruited to Its full strength
and fitted out for service in the Philip
pine Islands.
The landing at Daiquiri was effected on
June 22. from which day to August 15,
the date of embarkation for Montauk
Point, the regiment took a conspicuous
part in all the operations about Santiago.
In the great battle of July 1 it was in the
thick of the fight at El Caney, pre-emi
nently distinguishing itself by assaulting
and capturing the stone fort, the key to
the enemy's intrenchments, -which, skill
fully defended by General Rey del Rey,
had stayed for the time Lawton's division
in its advance toward Santiago.
Leaving the dead unburied and the
wounded on the field, to be cared for as
best might be by the medical department,
Â¦with the assistance of the regimental
band, the day's fighting scarcely over, the
regiment at dark moved again toward the
tnemy. It had marched the greater part
of the night of June 30, had fought all
<Jay July 1 and now started on the all
night march to join the left wing of the
army. In the early hours of the morning
Jt took position with the rest of the bri
gade near San Juan and did its part in
the severe fighting of July 2 and 3.

General Shafter's army corps, the Fifth,
In which, under the command of Lieuten
ant Colonel Richard Comba (Colonel An
drews having been appointed a brigadier
general of volunteers), it was destined to
perform a memorable part in the San
tiago campaign.
At the outbreak of the Spanish war the
Twelfth Infantry was stationed at Fort
JCiobrara, Nebraska. Under the command
of its then colonel, John N. Andrews, the
regiment joined the other regular troops
at Chickamauga Park and later was
The soldiers of the Twelfth that arrived
on Sunday were landed at the Presidio
yesterday and will in a few days start
across the continent to Forts Douglas,
Duquesne, Apache and Bliss, between
which posts the regiment will be divided.
The Twelfth United States Infantry,
part of which returned from the Philip
pines on the transport Grant, which ar
rived Sunday, has as fine a fighting
record as any organization in the Gov
ernment service. The Twelfth has dealt
its share of effective blows for the Stars
and Stripes, and its contribution of pre
cious lives to the maw of the war god
has reached heartrending proportions.
