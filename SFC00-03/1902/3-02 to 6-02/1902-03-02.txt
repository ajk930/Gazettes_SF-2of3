son. and who wants to wear a waist that
everybody remembers from one year to'
another?
One of the prettiest, and one that would
make every woman feel well satisfied
with herself, is of Bheer white lawn.
There ;s absolutely no fullness from the
shoulders. The band which holds the
buttons has three tiny tucks on either side
of it. The only ornamentation is a zig
zag of black and white floss. The whole
effect looks like 80 many baby roses, and
while the effect is not at all like a wreath,
the idea bobs into one's headend it stays
there, too.
The most popular waist of all ia what Is
called the Gibson. It is very mannish and
on a perfect figure is most attractive. The'
hnen ones are buttoned up the front and
have three board tucks on either side of
the band'. Extending over the shoulder
like a broad tuck Is the Gibson part of^iLi

And. then Horace G. Platt went on Â¦ to
speak of General Barnes aa he looks to
him.
"You don't want a history of the Gen
eral, dd you? ( ForJ wouldn't like to tell
the true and entire history of any man
I know. Oh, Just a personal description
of him; well, I guess 1 can give Von
that."
HORACE G. PLATT, ATTORNEYâ
""When he speaks he wears a Prince Al
bert," he went on. "For business he weara
a dark sack coat. He usually weara a
derby hat. * Hla jewelry consists of a atick
pinâ a pear-shaped pearl surrounded by
diamonds, and a large ring. This ring Is
of diamonds cut In the old-fashioned way,
by hand; and It Is ornamented with fine
lines of black enamel in the old-fashioned
way. It has a very interesting histoy.
which la another story.
"Hla name ia William Henry Longfel
low Barnes and I think he was born In
New Yorkâ either New York or New Eng
land.
"Ho Is 5 feet VA Inches tall and he
weighs about 210. He is 65 years old, I
should say at a guess.
Â¦ "He has a fair, healthy akin and hia
teeth are regular and goodâ white aa can
be. .
"He carries a cane when he goes off for
a long walk. What kind of a cane? Now,
let me think. I guess he has different
canes. Seems to me he has one with an
ivory top, but I can't be sure. Seems to
me â no, I declare, I can't tell. And I
know him so well. too.
"Is there anything striking about him?
Just one thingâ he is strikingly hand
some."
"Call him 59 years old, and I think. you
will strike it about right," says Mr.
Crocker. "To be exact in figures the Gen
eral must be about 6 feet 9%. inches tall,
and I will make a rough guess that his
weight is 204. pounds. He has eyes of
bluish gray, and a fairly good head
of hair of brownish gray. He has
a mustache and he has no ncars or blem
ishes Â¦ that I ever saw, and I hope ho
hasn't any, anyway. I should call hid
face a medium . full one. He is alwaya
quietly but well dressed, and I think ho
wears a derby hat. He always. wears a
heavy gold ring.
"A medium sized hand and a quiet,
stately walk are two -other things that
belong to him. He always lets you know
that he. is a good American, so I think
there can be no doubt of his nationality."
S. WESTINGTONâ
Clerk of the California Hotel, f
Mr. Westington thought that he didn't
know anything about tho General at first,
in spite of the- fact that he. lives at his
hotel. On second consideration' he came
to several conclusions.
One of them was that, he is as much
as 6 feet tall. "He's a big mnn. Â¦
"He is Imposing in appearance, too. He
carries his nead up like a general, sure
enough. 1 guess he weighs as much as
200 pounds, but he carries hla weight -as
light as if it wasn't half that much.
"He has keen eyes, I know, but I can't
tell what color they are. Â¦ I- never -got
close enough to him for that. .
"His face is oval in shape and the chin
Is round.. \His hair and mustache are
gray* I think he is u little baldâ only a
little. ' 'Â¦:
"It seems to me that his hands -and
feet are kind of large, and', of a good
shape. . v â¢ " . Â¦ -
"It's a pretty hard thing to tell the age
of a man like that. He must be under 50
judging from the way he walks and
talks. . But maybe he'll be as easy on
his feet when he Is 75. He's one of' that
kind. , â¢ :
"He usually -wears a black frock - coat
and a derby hat, with no jewelry,- so far
as I know. .>
"American? .Sure, -he's an American.. I
don't know his full name, but, his initials
are W. H. L. And he's an American

and he is slightly bald. His I face is
neither long nor round in contour, but be
tween them both. He wears a mustache
and haa a high forehead. He has- no
scars that I know of. Tho General is al
wnys very well and neatly dressed, andl
havo sometimes met him In the park with
a sweater on. His handa are of- good
size for a man of his physique. On one
of them I havo seen him wear. a ring. He
is a rapid walker, and stands very erect.
His voice is full and of medium d*pth
of tone. By birth he is a New, Yorker. I
regard him as one, of the. best. orators of
the country." , .â¢

"The moat marked thing about General
Barnes Is his walk." It would . be conven

but I , Imagine that kings . don't reallÂ»
amount to 'much. It would be truer to
say .that he walks like an American. Do
you- know what that means? As if he
were sure, of: himself. He puts his feet
down. solidly; His walk' used to be very
quick, he ran upstairs like a flash; but
nowadays' it, is growing more deliberate.

or mark him. aa far as 1 know.
"He must be a six-footer, and 210 pounds
will about catch him for weight. Hia face
la a fine intelligent one, rather long I
should call it, and decorated with a mus
tache. He has gray hair.
POLICE OFFICER J. J. McSHANEâ
"Yes, Elr; I will give you any informa
tion that I can. A description of General
Barnes? Well, of courae I know the
general and have heard him do some of
his best epeaking many a time. But I
only know him as General Barnes, and
that is all the full name I can give you.
Oh. he's not so old. I should say C2 or
C5 ycara." So runs Officer McShanc's
opinion.
"His hands are well formed, and his
walk for a heavy snt man is rather state
ly and his carriage Is good. Hla nation
ality ia a thing that 1 know nothing about.
His voice ia a good one to listen to, rather
light in quality."
"Hla age I should take to be about 62
years, and his hair Is only grayish, and
he's not bald yet. A mustache Is becom
ing to a face that is round like his, and
I think his eyes are light In color and
that he has .a high forehead. He ia about
5 feet lo inches in height, and he must
weigh about 200 pounds. Don't you think
so? He has fair skin and no scant.
"I think of the gentleman you speak of
aa General W. H. L. Barnes, for I do
not know hia full name. I always remem
ber him, too, when he cornea in here to
the club, as a striking looking man and
always well dressed. Thatls a good sign
to begin on, you know. The only strike.
Ing thing I could think of in his dresa ia
the Knights Templar charm that he
wears on hla chain.
F. H. CORYâ
Secretary Union League Club.
F. B. BERNHARDâ
General Barnes' Barber.
"I've been cutting the General's hair for
thirty years. Particular? Well. I should
say he Is. He's a crank about It. He al
ways wears it parted on the side, just
over the left eye. He has a pretty 1 fair
head of hair yet, but It's quite gray, es
pecially over the ears. His mustache ft
white.
"No, I never shave him. He shaves
himself every morning and gives himself
a close shave, too.
"Let me see, his height I should say Is
6 feet, and his weight Is 203 or 210
pounds, and it hasn't changed a bit in
thirty yeara.
"The General ia plain, straight Ameri
can and his name la William Henry
Longfellow/ Barnes. I've known him for
thirty-nve years.
"As to his faceâ well, I'd say It was
round; with a broad, heavy chin. Ha has
big ears and a straight nose, but I never
noticed .his hands or feet, except that I
know he wears a ring, with a creat of
some kind, on the third finger of hla left
hand.
"He's a good dresser all right. Always
wears a blue suit, close-flttJng, and al
ways buttoned. He Isn't much for flashy
ties, but wears dark ones with a pearl
pin set with diamonds. He wears a turn
over collar and he always looka neat.
"His mouth? Well now. hla mustache
comes down over that pretty well, but
he's got a fine set of teeth that are fast
in his head."
EMMA STJLLIVANâ
. Chambermaid at California Hotel.
Pretty and piquant is the dark-eyed
rlrl that makes beds on the floor of tha
California Hotel where the Barnes' apart
ments are. She Is an observer, too, and
her description of the General ta positive.
"The General fa 6 feet 11, weighs
200 pounds and la past 60. Hla eyes/ are
light, not very large, and he looks fthls
â¢way (and she scowled prettily to Indicate
an overhanging brow). His hair la quita
gray and getting scares on top. He has
a gray, mustache and good teeth that ara
white, regular and his own. Hia feet
are a beautiful shape and small for a
man of hia size. There la nothing un
usual about hia hands as to size or shape,
but he wears a diamond marquise ring on
the* third finger of his right hand. Ha
throws hla shoulders back and stands
very erect.
"He dresaes like a fashion plate. He
wears a frock coat, pretty ties of modest
color, generally four-in-hand, with a soli
taire pearl pin or sometimes a skull pin.
He always wears a turnover collar mads
on the shirt, and the cuffs are also mails
on the shirt, which is white and always*
spotless. I never saw a man neater in
his dress.
"His name ia W. H. L. Barnesâ I think
William Henry. He was born In New
York City."
"Ill* face is round, with a high fore
head, and I never noticed that he wore
any Jewelry. When he speaks It Is slowly
and ftnprcssivcly, and with a deep, beau
tiful voice. If you once heard him speak
in public you would remember it. He
ualks Blowly. I think he Is an Ameri

name is on our books as General W. H. L.
Barnes, and I don't know what the Ini
tials are for. I should think he was about
55 yea ra^ old.
"I eho'uld guess his height to be 5 feet
8 inches, and he must weigh at least
190 pounds. I have never noticed the
color of his eyes. He has white hair and
is rKpr.tly bald. He wears a mustache

J. WALTEB HAYâ
Clerk at Bohemian Club.
"Oh, yes; one^Jlttle thing that Is char
acteristic: he moves his head slowly from
side to fide when speaking. That's about
the best I can do in the description line,
I think."
"He is one of those men who. dress so
quietly that they are always well dressed.
His hands or his walk I have never no
ticed. He has a fine voice with the best
of training of a public speaker. He was
born In New York, I believe.
"If my life depended on It, I. could not
tell the color oMils eyes, but I do know
that his hair is gray; that he is not baldi
and that he wears a mustache. I don't
believe that he has any scars. His faco
seems to me on, the square order, and ha
has a forehead of medium height
"Sixty years havo touched him lightly,
I think, and about B feet 10 Inches would
represent his height, while I should Judge
he weighed about 190 pounds.
"General W. H. I* Barnes,", said Mr.
Field, "represent* the older set in the 1

why I have not seen as much of. him

blemishes that I know of. I should call
his face oval, and his fcrehead is high and
bread. His dress is always neat, and I
think he wears no Jewelry. His voice is
pleaeant, and he has a distinct enuncia
tion and speaks quite deliberately. He is
a full-blooded American. His hands I
have never noticed particularly, nor hia
walk. I think he is a nne-looking man all
around."
"Hi* weight? Call It 200 pounds, and his
height 5 feet 10 inches. His eyes are
gray and his hair dark brown with a mix
ture of gray. He is not bald. He wears a
mustache and he has no scars or f acini
"Yes. I think I can give a pretty fair
description of General Barnes. To begin
with 1 know his initials are W. H. L., but
I don't know what the corresponding
names are. I think his first name is Wil

pliment when I say I should think he Is

W. H. BEATTYâ
Chief Justice of Supreme Court.
"tn dress I think he inclines to darl
sack coats and wears very little jewelryi
A chain Is the only thing I remember.
His hands are powerful ones, though noi
large, for his physique. His walk Is a
very free and easy one. Great intelli
pence and a personal magnetism which
at once draws you to him are two of his
most marked characteristics or qualities.
"He is a thorough American, by birth,
instinct and education, and he is proud
Of It"
If I can. From the sole of his feet to the
crown of c his head, where ;. there t Is now
not' as, much -brown"" iTalr as there once
was, I should think was a distance of
about 5 feet 9 Inches. I never noticed
any scars. : --Â¦. .
"Well, now, I ought to be able to de
rcribe the General. We've been friends
for yearsâ I've known him socially, and
all that. His age? Let mp seeâ 1363, the
fall ff Richmondâ it was on that day that
I was admitted to practice in the Supremo
Court, and he was a member of the ex
amining board. I remember he made a
speech from the balcony of the hotel that
night. I was 22 and he was seven or eight
years older. I should say he's 67. I'va
heard some say he's 70, but I don't be
lieve it.
"He stands 5 feet 9, and weighs 190â I'm
sure I'm close on that. He has a full
fac&â I wouldn't call It round, but full,
with a round chin. As to his nose. X
can't say whether it's . Grecian or Ro
man, but It isn't crooked and it doesn't
turn up. I should say the contour of hla
face is perfect â the General's a, fine-look
ing man.
"His eyes? Not for the life of you could
I tell the color of his or any one's else.
When he speaks before the Judge and
Jury, they are very prominent, but ordin
arily I wouldn't calf them either bulging
or deep-set.
"Now, let me see: as to his hands â what
I've noticed particularly is that he uses
his left hand sometimes when he writes.
He is ambidextrous, and uses either
hand. But sometimes in my court I'va
seen him hold the chalk in his left hand
when writing #n the blackboard, and it
looks awkward.
"Then, too, .he wears a flaming ringâ a
diamond or kite-shaped ring. He'a told
me about that ring; it has a history. It
isn't set with diamonds, nor brilliants; I
think it is some kind of metal that looks
like diamonds. He wears it on the third
finger of his left hand.
"Oh, yes, and he wears a button of
some chevalier order that was bestowed
on him by the King of Sweden for some
act of bravery. And on the left lapel of
hfs ccat he wears the button of the Loyal
Legion.
"Now, let me thinkâ how does he wear
his watch? Yes, I'm sure he carries a
watch, and he used to wear the double
chain with his cigar-cutter, on one end.
But for the life of me I can't tell how
he wears it now, whether with fob or
chain.
"The General's hair is pretty gray here"
âtapping his temples with his fingers.
"As for the rest of It, what would you -
call hair when it's sort of pepper-and-salt
color? Iron gray â I guess that's what It
Is, for It was dark before It began to
turn. Now, I'm sure he wears a mus
tacheâyes, surely he does, unless he's
cut it off in the last month. It's Ions
and military-like, and he has a habit of
stroking it. I'm so sure about this that
I'm almost afraid I'm wrong."
The Judge grew more interested In the .
description of his friend, and as his In
terest increased his certainty grew less.
"I ought to be able to tell all about
him, but I declare It's hard when you're
pinned down to it. I'm inclined tcÂ» think
his name is William Henry Lawrence,
and I known he is an American.
"The General isn't a dapper man, but
he's not careless in his dress, either. He's
not what you'd call ultra-fashionable â
â¢ not the 'glass of fashion and mold of
form' sortâ nor is he ever shabby In
appearance. In court he always wears a
business suit, dark in color^don't think
I ever saw him In a light suit. I'm under
the impression, too, that he wears very
fine shirts. I know when he gets warm,
he opens hia coat and vest, and I've often
noticed his shirts, especially tha tab
with 4 \V. H. L. B.' in large letters. Hla
tlea, I should say, are rather gay than
somber, and I know I've seen a pin In
them sometimes. I would say. to be bold,
that he always wears a four-in-hand tie.
Take it all the way through, he's a nice
dresser without being a fashionable one.
He'a a striking looking man, is the Gen
eral, finely molded and commanding In
appearanceâ and a fine fellow, too.
JUDGE JOHN HUNTâ
Judge of the Superior Court.
So it is in the descriptions bÂ«!cw of one of the best-known men of
San Francisco. Twenty pebple have given a mental portrait of him, and
none of them remember him Exactly as he really is.
Many of them have taken the same landmark, if the word may be
bo used, and the average of opinions concerning this same landmark or
prominent feature is fairly correct. But of the strictly personal features
many descriptions are widely apart. Even those who are nearest to the
man, and who see him daily, show many of them a lack of observation
in small things that is surprising, and others show a degree of observa
tion that is equally so. It is interetting to note that it is not always
the best educated people and those in the higher walks of Ufe who ob
serve the most intelligently and correctly. The personal description of Â«*
well-known man, such as General Barnes, by twenty- contemporaries from
all walks of life, forms an interesting study for the psychologist.
f=z AN you describe a man's personal appearance and characteristics, so
i( correctly as to give the person looking for this man no difficulty
V^ in recognizing him on sight from your description? Ten chances to
cae you will reply "Yes, I can." But there are also ten chances to one
In favor of your not being equal to the task.
Even a well-known man must be changed .\1 the hands of those
who attempt to describe him. One observes him with the eye guided
by a mind trained to observe even the smallest things" and details of life,
aided by a retentive memory. Another, though he meet him frequently,
xf asked m th* interval between tbesÂ«- meetings to describe even the fea
tures of this well-known man, could not do so correctly;
Many people have what may be called visual memories; they re
member simply what they see; while others have a memory that is large
.y auditory. Yet both of these classes can by continued effort tra'.u
themselves to observe closely, but few people take the trouble to do Â»o.'
Many can describe nature or the minute parts of mechanism who would
not be able to recall the color of a person's eyes.
la the tragic events whiclt the public has been surfeited with of
late, personal descriptions of men have formed an important part. But
lew of them have tallied the one with the other, except perhaps in on*
or two prominent features.

General once had with a highwayman,

"Hello, Henderpon, Yes, come in," the
captain euid, t-inninp hie. position so as
to be alile to show his face to the lieu

"Old Bcott'e rlrl, beyond queition. But
what is ishe doing here?" he repeated for
the hundredth time. "What is she doing
here?"
"May I come in, captain?" asked a
cheery voice at the door.
And yesterday, galloping in from a
scout over the range, he had without
warning been brought face to face with
her in this nqualld. sordid, boisterous,
ruffianly communityâ a woman in years
and looks now. her face marked with the
lines that care and trouble leave, and the
gladÂ«surprise in her eyes giving place al
nioM at once to a mute appeal that wrung
Kis heart because of the mystery of it
and becauf-c she had hurried away like
one afraid. Bhe had caught by the hand a
little boy who was with her, and almost
had to run to avoid him. There could be
no mistake, he felt cure. The face had
changed, as all thingK change with time;
but the oyoeâ and that haunting, appeal
ing look!
It easier for him to ko away. Vntil thfn
he had hnd uncomfortable mnmrnts when
tver he thought that one day duty to th.?
Government would call him away and
pever his pleasant relations with the
Bcotts. He was clad rather than *ad
when at Iaft the ordrr did come: and he
had gone nwny In som^ihlng of a huff,
because (she -would not or could not, evpn
at the parting, put off that new shyness
and bid him farewell, as the often had
done when he was going away only for
a day, with a kiss.
That was rears and years agoâ thirteen
at the very least. He had thought of her
often since then, and now and again her
name and news of her had crept into his
letters from home; and always he had
had that wistful, unavailing, unreasoning,
half-angry regret that fihe had not re
mained the laughing, nprlghtly elf in
ehort clothes who loved to romp with
him over thÂ»Â» gra:;Fy lawns at home.
Her fnth<r had helped him to his com
ml?rlon; and this marked rhnnpe in Bes
sie, coming so potin aftrrwurd. had mad'!
He reiTirmbercd his sorrow nf thnt
time. This change had rut him off front
the untrammelrd, unconventional, Jolly
comradeship they hnd enjoyed. She kUII
was a child in yrnrn thrn. but those long
clothes nrd that phynrsn br longed to an
oilier nepfle. who war n ptrHtiRor to him.
He regretted it because he could nc
lnncrr be at cafe with hrr as with a child
cr frolic as one mlRht with a Jolly, elfish,
merry little Bl6ter. He cou\1 not think
of her in any other llKht; he desired Â«io
closer rrlailonchip. Their comradeship
had had ltn birth In hor .father's friend
ship for him. and had continued because
of a port of temperamental affinity be
tween them.

asked.
Henderson stared, and then, us thÂ« cap

mimic performance of clapping his hands
as H mark of approval.
"Yes. Briefly, this is all I know about
her since I have been in the service: The
year that I came away she married a man
chosen for her by her father. She had had
a suitor named Goodwin â the wild fellow
I spoke aboutâ but the old man would
have none of him. I don't know that tho
girl cared for him, mind you. He was un
deslrablo from any point of viewâ* hard
drinker, a spendthrift, and, naturally, a
gambler. The old man was getting on in
life, and he was anxious to see the girl
comfortably settled, I suppose. The war
was threatening then. too. and as the
sympathies of the old man and his son-in
law were with the South of course my
connection with the family was broken
and I lost track of them for a time. "When
the trouble was over I> learned that thÂ«
old man had died of heart diseaseâ Joy
over the news of the result at Bull Run
killed him. When Grant succeeded Hal
leck and began his double move- against
the South Scott's son-in-law joined the
Confederate army. He was wounded In
the Wildernessâ shot to pieces, almostâ
and went back to Bessie a hopeless crip
ple, absolutely helpless. She nursed and
cared for him until three years agoâ
when he died, as I have said. There was
name mention In one of my letters of a
child. What became of It I can't say."
"She has left a childâ a boyâ over In
town." Â»
"Has left? Dr> you mean that ah*

"Hut why, and where?"

"And the boy? Btirely they havÂ« not

"We have enly Beleher'a word for it.

"There can bÂ« no 'unl#sÂ«' In this caae,

will Mak* my life upon It that she has
been tricked."
"No." he said, after a time, "she could
not have been In Texas three years ago.
Her husband died about that time."
"Oh. then she had a husband?" Hender
son was surprised.
"Of course, the parson doesn't remem
ber the name of Scott!" he cried. "How
could he, when she would not have given
that name? Don't you see. Henderson?
You ' have been Jumping nt conclusions
again." and he heaved a sigh of relief.
"I haven't Jumped at anything, and I
don't see anything," the lieutenant retort
ed, dlagust apparent in his tones. "You
mentioned only one name to me. If she
baÂ» half a dozen, of course she may have
used one of the others In 8an Antonio."
But the captain was busy again with
his own thoughts and paid no heed to
him.
The captnin shook his head sadly.

he said. "Her husband â "

apked, "Why dnÂ«gn't It take you right off

The boy tmw that he hud been illogle&li
but he did not alter his determination.
"I want to Â«o ii^.'rt uer. i must gvt BomÂ«>

"Oh, Vest" he cried, eagerly. "1 had a

"Whnro's home?" Â¦
"WhÂ«rÂ« I tame from," the boy replied,

"Then I guess you can't ride a whole,

so'h to get used to hitting tho ground

Mr. Bud Drleher had b*en observing
them for some minutes from the burn. HÂ«
approached and whispered something In
llrorkman'H car.
"Bhol You don't mean It!" Brockm.ui
exclulmed. regarding the boy with uniuro
sympathetic interest..
Mr. Dud Belcher nodded his houd. "ri'n

phatically. .
Brockman looked surprised. "Reckon
I'm wrong, after all," he nuld, "Yea, air;
reckon I'm wrong. You ain't one of them
thinking chaps at all, or elae that talent's
been hut'ked off sudden,"
"Perhaps it would keep me but of the
way of the. Indians, Â»n the first place," tha
boy argued.
"Yes," the ranchman continued, whim
sically, "that's where you belong. You've
got what folks out here ealls a talent for
tinkering with time. It sure would make
you rich back East. But out hereâ well,
out here U'b a leedle out of place, as thÂ«j
fiddler eaid to the cow that camo to hb
dance. It would sure get you scalped first
full of the moon."
Something in the youngster's manner,
and a sharp, quick, decisive note In his
voice, made Brockman turn and observe
him more closely. Then he patted his
head. ': '.,:Â¦ ''" . â¢ ,
' "You're one of them considering chaps,"
he said, with a smile. "One of them that

towns Is where you belong. It's fellows
like you that grows up to be biff rich.
They just sits down nnd looks at a thing
all 'round, and finally tackles It plumb
rightâ on the soft side."
The youngster glanced up at him, a
pleased expression on his face.
â¢ "No," the boy said quickly. "I wouldn't
do that. That wouldn't keep the Indiana
off."
"It's the safest bet a man ever made."
Brockman agreed. "You'd be scared good.
And you'd just about plump down and go
to hollering for, your mammy. That's
what you'd do."
The boy pondered the question awhile
before replying. It was as If he were
trying to conjure up Just such an emer
gency as had been suggested to test his
conductâ to try himself outâ bpfore an
swering. By and- by he shook his head.
"I can't tell," he said. "I'd be frightened.

as they came along had told him that In

A SKITTISH MULE AND AN INDIAN
CHAPTER Vt
"Great guns, I plumb forgot Edt" ex
claimed Dalton. ; The boss herder looked
worried. "He's ' coming out alone from,
Jacksboro with a wagon-load of grub/ and
ho'll just, about run Into this bunch," ho
explained to the runner. â¢ After a mo
ment's thought he turned to the group of
herders. "Boys.',' said he Impressively,
"I'm going to let the horses shift for
themselves, if the Indiana Â¦ get themâ
"There's Brockman. What are, we go*
Ing to do about Ed?" Jack Langford said.
"TOO risky, 1 . 1 Bald DahCm. "The 1ft.

to ask any or my boya to take the chance

on the lookout,"
"They'll know about the rangers," waa
Dalton's comment. "They'll not go Into

bellyful of that last time."
"How About fettlnf word to the rang**
%nV* aiked the runner.
"Yes. But he 'ain't on the .upper ranch
no more," said Frank Ringer. "They
ain't nothing but niggers on that uppur
ranch now.' Six of 'em. I was over that
way after horses 'bout a month ago."
"Don't make no difference where he's
Irom," Dalton said as the runner galloped
up . and dismounted. "He's got news,
sure." - He strode out to meet the new
comer. "Howl" he said.'
â¢'How!" said the runner, stooping to
loosen his girths. "Seen any Indian
sign -hereaway?"
"No,". Dalton said as the others came
crowding around. "Have you?*'
VYes. It's thick out our way.' They
killed all the niggers on the upper ranch,
and then went on south a piece. But
they'll be strlktng back to the Nation
â¢fbro long, and olo Milllken 'he thought
.they'd be like to come out '. this a-way.
So he .sent me to give you word."
"Come in and feed," Dalton said.
When the runner had satisfied his hun
ger, ho gave them what Information he
had.
1 "Ole Satanta hlsself must be with this
bunch." he said. "They sure are wicked.
Chopped our men up something terrible.
Opened 'em up and emptied the meal
sacks Into 'em.. Niggers made a big fight,
too. Cartridge hulls lying around thick
er'n heel flies. 'Less they turn back by

liken he sent in tox the troops, and the
rangers are In camp on the Cameron,
down there In the valley. 0o If they turn
back to the east of you. they'll catch It
good and hot, I'm a-thlnklug."
"That looks like one of the MUlikun
outfit," suggested Jack Langford, spring*
log to his feet. "Remember, John? Wo
saw that fellow down in the Valley last
round-up.".
"No. White man. Riding like blue
blazes, too. Horse all covered with suds.
Thero's trouble back of that chap. Reckon
I wasn't off the scent much, after all."
"What is It this time, Johnâ Indians?"
Bud Wlllett asked as Dalton adjusted the
glasses to his eyes.
After their midday meal they had
grouped themselves in the shade of tho
ranch on the east and were talking in
desultory fashion of. the events of tho
morniig, when Dalton sprang up, ran to
his saddle and pulled his range-glasses
from a ease' he carried swung upon the
horn.
Just now John's nose was bothering
him a great deal; The ranch cattle to
the number of Â¦omÂ« thousands were be*
Ing "loose-herded"â that in, left to go
where they would within certain llberul
II ml inâ on the range over toward Union
Creek, miles to the west of the ranch.
Ordinarily the men divided into two par*
ties and rode around them once a day
frum opposite directions, hcuttlng tho
outlying cattle back toward a comon cen
taf, but to-day, because of John's nose,
there* had been a change. The men had
gohu out singly, radiating from the ranch
llko spokes in a wheel, with Instructions
'to ride ten miles straightaway and return
without regard to the cattle, but with
their eyes wide open for. Indian sign. The
men had all returned shortly after noon,
and not one had seen anything suspi
cious. :.';.'
Dallon's manner of handling his mea
was much like ah old hen's fashion of
fussing over a young brood. He would
go sleeplesB to Incruaso their comforts),
would rustle up dalntieu in the game way
for them when they were a bit off their
feed, would scold them like sin when
they went'beyond bounds with him. unU

all lovml him and would have gone al*
most to uny extreme to have proved it
hint tnere bean occasion.
â¢ Tho men on the Half-Diamond L ranch
used to say that John Dalton could smell
an Indian miles and miles away. Dalton
was the boss-herder, a thin, wiry, ner
vous man. with Bkln the color of a rlpo
prickly peur and eyes like a hawk's. 'Na
poleon Benoisâ old Pole, the 'boys affec
tionately hud dubbed himâ said tu him

"Ye'd a-been an eagle, John) If you

"We sure missed a heap," he said. "But
the sign made It air pretty clear to me.

And then a runner with definite news
about the Klowas called the captain and
his men off in another direction; far to
the south, and the situation could not be
altered for a time, much as the captain
regretted it. '...-.
and a cloud of duet hid the advancing
host, if host it was.
"And wrong once. moreâ whlpsawed. so

"They're coming all right. Lot tnls be

smiting a boulder with it.
"How many times have I warned you
that you were on the road to hell?" the
parson was saying as Brockman stepped
up to them, "How many times, have I
told you that strong drink would lead
you to, the crime of blood-letting? Have
you no fear of God's Judgment?"
"Shouldn't have made a nlBgor ho
damned Bi*sny, then," the drunken des

Broekmun said as Horner disappeared,

his lips, the little fellow- laid down the
six-shooter, picked up the lines, clucked
to the mules, straightened them out and
went on.
Brockman pulled aside the canvas cov
er. One glance was enough. â¢â¢Hurrah!"
he cried. "Now we'll show 'em. That's
our outfit. Hear 'em yell! Pump It into
'em, boysl" And he Jumped on tho scut
and Bwuhg his hat as the Half-Diamond
lÂ» crowd circled in between the wagon
and the timber. "Follow the trail, my
maverick, and keep 'em going," he said,
as he jumped out with his gun. "We'll
cau-h up with you; the mules will take
you to tho ranch if we don't."
"There's some of them right In front,"
said the little chap, trying hard to draw a
bead with the heavy revolver. "Look!"
"Keep 'em going!" cried Brockman.
Puffs of smoko broke out all along the
tlmbet*, and there was an occasional puff
from the wagon, which the four mulei
were .yanking along faster than ever It
traveled before; it swayed and burnpa.l
and tossed and jolted, now and again ca
reenglng on the rim of a gully and seem
ing about to dash itself and its contenta
to pieces. v
I Prostrate on the grub in the bed of tha
wagon lay Brockman, pumping his Win
chester viciously every time one of the
attacking party came Into view. On the
seat, lashing the wheelers with the long
ends of the lines and cheering them on in
a piping voice, was that midget of a Boy,
his big, staring eyes sparkling with ex
citement and his hair blown back from
a pale, drawn face. Suddenly he caught
sight' of the band of men galloping mad
ly down upon them from In front. Ha
made a quick turn around his wrists with
the lines, surged back upon them until
the mules slowed down, when he wrap

their knees and with Dalton In the lead,
were racing away to the eastward. Ten
miles from the ranch the trail swung
down by the Hotith and through a slough
covered with mesqulto. At the head of
this slough Dalton pulled up and turned
in hla saddle. Holding his arm out
stretched, with the palm of the hand be
tween the lower edge of the sun and the
horizon line, he found that three fingers
filled the gap.
."Get Hernld'.t men' to Join Ikard's*. If

later, when the runner was about to utart
out. "Tell, them to work in between
these bucks and the Panhandle, so'ts to

to give them a dose that will kei*p them

" 'When the Raven was dead the
Squaw-who-has-dreams went to the secret
place an' threw the powder of the whirl

she distributed her fourteen bundles of
talk that were left among all the Sioux,
so that everybody could tell how glad he
felt because the' Raven was twisted and
died. Sb^.tar a week there was nothing
t)Qt Â¦ happiness an' big talk among the
Sioux; an* Moh-kwa, the Bear, came

squaw. So now everything was ended

i " 'When the Raven has eaten the
Squaw-who-has-^lreami went out of the
tepee among the people an' called all the
Sioux to come an' see the Raven die. So
the Sioux came gladly an' the Raven was
twistad an' writhen with the powder of
the whirlwind wrenching at his heart;
an" his. teeth were tight like a trap; an*
no words," but' only foam, came from his
mouth; an' at last the Spiritâ the Chee

the Squawjwho-has-dreams was revenged
for the death of the Gray Elk whom she
loved, an' who always called her Kee
nee-moo-shaâthe Sweetheart, because it
made h^r laugh.
" 'When the Raven was asleep the
Squaw-who-has-dreams went also- herself
to the secret place an' got also a little of
the powder of the whirlwind. An' the
next morning she arose early an' gave
the powder of the whirlwind to the Ra

would she show to a man who did not
love her the great treasure of fire water
which Moh-kwa, the Bear, had found.
At this the Raven, who was hot to have
the treasure of flro water, an 1 whose eara
rang -with cur'oslty to hear the end of the
Story-that-never-ends. aa-w that he must
kill the Giant. Therefore when the
Squaw-who-has-dreams had ceased to sob
an* revile him. an' was gone as he thought
asleep, the Raven went to his secret place
where he kept the powder of the whirl
wind an' took a little an' wrapped it in a
leaf an' hid the leaf in the braids of his
lone hair. Then the Raven went to sleep.
" 'Then the Squaw-who-has-dreams
would tell no more that night, while thÂ«
Raven eat his fingers with cur'oslty. But
he ma/Je up a new plan not to twist the
Squaw-who-has-dreams until she showed
him the treasure of fire water an' told
him the end of the Story-tha't-never-endd
On her part, however, the Squaw-who

an" tore the' beads from her hair, an' saia
the Raven did not love her* for he had not
killed the Giant as he promised. She said
she would tell no more of the Story-that-

the Raven the first of the Story-that

talk; an' when the story 'ended for that
night the .'-JQquaw-who-haa-dreams was
saying: '.'An v so, out of trw lake that was

ulso with feet, an' It came up to me an'
said: "But ihen she would tell no more
that night; nor could the Raven who was
crazy with .cur'oslty prevail on her.' I;
must now sleep an' dream what thd
greeh fish with the yellow wings said."
was the reply of â¢ the Squaw-who-has
dreams; an' she pretended to slumber. So
the Raven, because he as cur'ous, put off
her death. ;,,
" 'AH night she. watched, but the Raven
did not go to the aectet place where he
had hidden the powder of the whirlwind.
Nor' the next day, when the sun went
down, did the Raven kill the. Giant. But
the Squaw-who-has-dreams took up again
the Story-that-never-ends an' told what
the green fish with the yellow wings sold;
an'> she used up a second bundle of talk.
When she closed for that time the Squaw
who-has-dreama was saying: "An' as night
fell Moh-kwa, the Bear, called to me from
his canyon an* said for me to qome an'
he would show me where tho great
treasure of fire water was burled for you,
who are the Raven. .So I went Into the
canyon, an' Moh-kwa, the Bear, took me
by the hand an' led me to the treasure
of fire water, which was greater an' rich

When-dee-goo. She knew the Giant wu
too big an' strong for the Raven to kill
with his lance, an' that he must get his

watch him an' learn its secret place. The

" 'This is the 'story of the fate of Kaw-

died long ago, my mother told me. Tho
Raven died because he anked too mnny
questions an' wns too cur'ous. It began
when Sublet te, who wan a trader, chitm

Sublette wn* mud nt this, an' said next

so they would not rob him. So he brought
a llttlp cask of flro water an 1 left it on
the bank of the Big Muddy. Then
Sublette went nwny, an' twenty, of the
Raven's young men found the little cask.
But they were greedy an' did. hot tell tho
others that he did not love; they were
twisted an' died. At last there wita no
more of the powder of the whirlwind; the
Uiiven must wait till Sublette came up

was of the Raven's people. The Gray Elk
was a Choo-ayk-eedâ n great prophet.

can fix wagen, when dealing with Indi

that they are detrimental. to unorganized
labor by being exclusive. But of. the
dozen or more constitutions of unions
which we have examined not a single one
holds to the principle of restricting mem
bership. * â¢ â¢ They all- require ef
ficiency as a protection to -themselves.
Have npt the doctors, dentists, lawyers
and teachers procured legislation re
stricting mgmbership In their respective
professions to those who can 1 pass cer
tain tests? So with labor unions. â¢ â¢ â¢
Next, are the wage-earners of America
justified in demanding a larger share of
the- wealth produced ; by them? Carroll
D. Wright states that by machinery pro
duction is so cheap and can. be done
on such a large scale that the manu
facturers' profitu are more than ten times
as great as they 'were one hundred and
fifty years ago. And this statement is
borne out by facts. The Associated Press
dispatches last week stated that the steel
trust has made over $80,000,000 in the first
nine months of its existence. It Is not
ncceBsary to cite statistics to, prove tlÂ«it
the manufacturers are growing rich at an
alarming paco. Now, why have .; not
wages advanced too? . /
The economic welfare of a nation does
not depend upon the upbuilding of a few
large fortunes, ;but the equitable' distri
bution of wealth. We cannot legislate
equilibrium between : labor and' capital.'
and how can capital be made to loosen its
tight grasp on the- share :of wealth that,
according, to the economic distribution: of
wealth, belongs to labor? I ask how can
this be done other than 'meeting orgunized
capital with organized labor?
Â¦In union there is (strength. Collective
bargaining onthe part of capital and free
competition, laborers will .'result' in what
Wttlker. calls the "degradation. of labor. V
But ; when ! a : committee representing " sev
orul thousand employes confers with Cap
ital; capital' listens. Without unions' la
I have cited authorities - and statistics
to prove that the margin of profit for
capital in the United States is "far -too
wide to permit that the Â»â¢ moderate de
mands-of labor unions for. higher' wages
will drive it out of the country,- and al30
to show that capital is amassing wealth
out of. all proportion to its economic im
portance. â¢ " â¢ Â¦. - .
thus employers find, it easy to keep them
down. The present division of wealth is
purely. abrltrary and not economic. The
employers keep from labor as much as
they think the . laborers will stand and
Walker says that unless labor. pursues its
interests It will lose its Interests.
our wonderful development In recent
WITH the advent of machinery
and production on a large scale
there came a great change. In
stead of there being fifty men
In a city each employing a half
dozen men In the manufacture of shoes,
for Instance, there came to be a single
factory employing two or three dozen
men and rnn by a single man or corpora
tion. And In recent years three corpora
tions even have been merged into larger
and more complete combinations, com
monly known as trusts. And to-day we
have not only a Shoe trust, but a coal
trust, a lead trust, Standard Oil trust, and
so on until practically all -branches of
production are controlled by trusts, and
there Is now In the process of develop
ment one grand combination or trust of
transportation systems la the United
States.
While there Is an economic gain result
ing from production on a large scale and
by the use of machinery, which is largely
th&red by labor Itself, when considered
absolutely, etill we must admit that the
gradual combination of capital has con
tributed to the lowering of the condition
of waKC-carners when compared with that
of the capitalists. As the Individual man
ufacturer was displaced by the corpora
tion and the corporation In turn was ab
sorbed by the trusts, we find the laboring
classes "being more and more confronted
with the proposition of selling their com
modityâlaborâin a market where the
competition among buyers has now come
to be practically eliminated altogether,
and in which the competition among
themselves has been Increased In conse
qtxence of no large a number being throwji
out of employment by the Introduction
of improved methods. Even the former
employers have many of them come to
be competitors for wages. And even more.
Women and children entered the faclo

Is organized labor a detriment to unor

school oppose the wage fund theory and
it la not reasonable to suppose that tho
Increase given to organized labor is de
ducted from the wages of unorganized
While organized labor has checked the
general fall In wages due to free competi
tion among laborers, unorganised labor
has not succeeded In doing thin, so 'some
bellevfed ihsit organized labor was get
ting more than Its share. But "abor, by
organizing, has fiucceÂ«Â»dcd In getting
nearer its share nnd 'unorganized labor
has merely failed to get Its share by fall
ing to organize. ,'
Another claim against labor unions Is
But the one thing that is going to make
the present question hard to solve Is this-
Corporations by their very nature are Im
pelled by all the ingenious contrivances
of the human mind for their financial gain
but are void of the higher motives of hu
manity, sympathy and charity, and thus
they have been long In recognizing the
justice of the claim of labor. But labor
unions have taught capital that It has its
duties as Well as Its rights, and has forced
capital to recognize the fact that labor
has Its rights as well as Its duties. â¢ â¢
There being one buyer In the market,
wage-earners would have to wait their
turn or underbid others before getting
employment. That constitutes, free com
petition among wage-earners and unity
on the part of employers. Our society is
based upon equality. That would be in
dustrial dependence of labor. Two or
three centuries ago the laboring classes
won their political equality. Now they are
struggling for industrial equality.
times, as it gives time for intellectual
progress. â¢ â¢ â¢ But the fact remains
that these improved methods, resulting
in the centralization of capital, are re
sponsible for the existence of labor un
ions. In further proof of this let me cite
the case of farm laborers. We have nev
er heard of an effort on the part of farm
laborers to organize. It is because the la
borers, as Individuals, can deal with farm
ers as Individuals. But let all the land In
the United States come to be operated Ay
a half-dozen corporations and we wou.d
find this solid phalanx met by a like com
bination on the part of farm laborers.

In discu.>sinc what labor unions have accom

Firstâ That strikes exist In spite of unions.
Secondâ That strikes are not so destructive
when conducted by unions.
Thirdâ That unlona have sained perma

Fourth â That unions have checked the fall
In wages and have shortened the hours of em

Fifth â That labor unions favor arbitration.
Sixthâ That arbitration will be Impossible
without labor being organized.
Seventh â That arbitration is now recog

disputes can be settled.
If the economic welfare of the United
States Is dependent- upon the amassing of
large fortunes by. few, then the tendency
of labor unions will be detrimental. But
if the economic welfare means j a more
equitable distribution of the wealth of
the nation, then we hold that labor unions
are not detrimental to the economic wel
fare of the .United States. \
borers have no voice In fixing the termn
of their employment. With unions both
imrtk'M to Hi" contract meet and agree
uiinii terma. This Is opening up a new era
in industrial hUUery. . It means the In
dustrial emancipation of the > laboring
man. It mcum* a higher degree of efll
eleney of laboring men. Walker shows
conclusively by statistics that the high
est paid labor is the most efficient. Doea
that mean that higher wages restrict pro
duction?
It Â»uch a terrible thing as the Freac
Revolution can find it* Justification t
what It accomplished for Europe, cann<
this movement In our country to-da'
which la characterized on the whole t
conservatism <and a high aense ot justh
and reason, but with some Incidental dt>
agrecablo features, I ask, cannot th
grpat labor movement llnd lu Justtflci
tion also?
It is an Important fact that when <&v
tal was slowly organising we find latx
slowly organising, and later, when cap
tal was rapidly organizing, wo find gret
activity among the labor unions. An
at the present time, when capital ia bÂ«
coming almost a unit in America, we fin
labor unions swiftly merging Into ot
great federation.
Another important thing to consider
the rapid change of sentiment In resar
to labor unions.
In America labor unions were at flrf
too insignificant for notice and were tc
tally ignored by the press. Later the
became noticed and were regarded aa enÂ«
mies of social progress, and the genen
opinion was that, they should be sui
pressed. All of this is now changed; nc
only are they recognized as justiflabl
but as necessary. â¢ â¢ ? In the year 18;
a convention of political economists we
held at Saratoga, and they expresse
their views that unions were not detr
mental. Of the great writers of the par
century on political economy Marshal
John Stuart Mill. Jevon, Walker, Cairnt
and Â¦ Kly consider unions beneflcia
although they do not agree with everj
thing the unions do. â¢ â¢ â¢ Now, let c
see what labor unions have done fc
wages and for hours of employment. "W
have gone over the two volumes of tfc
report of the Commissioners of Labo
compiled by Carroll D. Wright, ajid hav
found thi3 to be the caseâ that there ha
been a general tendency on the part of a
wages to decline since 1S70; 1880 marks th
lowest point for skilled labor. And thei
has been, generally speaking, a gradu:
increase since that year. But the wage
or unorganized labor have decreased tl
the present day. â¢ â¢ â¢ Now. why is
that the gradual fall of wages has bee
arrested between the years 1SS0 and 1890?
It is because of the merging of unioi
into the organization known as the Ame
lean Federation of Labor. In this tht
obtain better organization, more uniforn
Ity. greater strength and a more cor
servatlve use of this great strengt
â¢â¢-â¢;â¢ -I claim that unless labor unioi
had, checked the fall of wages it wou
have meant that over one million of wai
earners would have had to lower the
standard of llvlpg. This they could not c
without being degraded.
Labor has always been for arbitratlo
In the great convention held by the N;
tional Federation or Labor at Scranto
December last, the principle of arbitr
tion was voiced by the whole conventlo
I do not believe that there is a sine
person In this hall, not excepting our Â©Â¦
ponents, who does not believe that art
tration should settle disputes between I
bor and capital. But I would like to &i
our opponents: yes, I ask you all, how
there to be arbitration even If labor
not organized?
Is every laboring man to arbitrate Â«
Is labor, acting as a unit, to confer wit
capital as a unit, that is, by represent;
tion? You see the very solution of tl
whole matter is impossible without latx
being organized.
Immediately after the convention i

that there ia a power there. Graspin
capital will not heed the law. It will na
no attention, to the dictates of consclenc
because corporations are soulless and wi

power that cun force It."
We are taking the broad view in ui
holding organised labor for the good tin
It is doing and iat capable of dolne In ti
future.
History can point to no more horrthi
nightmare of violence than the Frene
Revolution, but there is Â¦unahtnÂ« i
Fmnej^to-day. and It la brighter In tfe
p-.i^.i-rtfj hut than In tho day* of Lou
But this is true of any organization
to some extent. I claim that labor Is, do
ing a good thing In bringing about an
understanding, between labor and capital.
It is more than legislation is able to do
and there is danger ahead for our nation
if an understanding ia hot reached. Labor
Is doing more by organizingâ it is check
ing the centralization of financial and po
litical power in thehands of a few. Burke
says that government ia a matter of ex
pediency; 'that is, it is practical. And
-our Government has nothing to fear from
unions if they succeed In adjusting this
great; question,' as they are on the eve
of doing. But the great positive benefit
of our Government comes from the intel
lectual and moral elevation of several
million laboring men, the bulwark of tho
nation. A Government is benefited more
by. having education diffused throughout
the body politic than by having these cen
tralized. We arc a democracy, not an
aristocracy. * â¢ â¢ If the sole object of
our,people were to produce the greatest
amount of wealth possible, . and if the
supply of labor were unlimited. It would
not make so much difference about the
condition of the laboring man. But as It
is, we consider him something more than
a machine with an economic function
only. This" being the case, and the in
dustrlal conditions being as they are, how
I else can. labor rise except .by organiza
tion for their mutual benefit and for the
purpose of checking the grasping ten
dencies of capital? _â¢ * ? One of the best
features about this" whole movement, the
feature that augurs beat for the future,
and the one that stamps it as being de
cidedly Anglo-Saxon, Is the fact that the
whole movement was initiated by the la
borers themselves. It has been developed
by them aloneâ with some mistakes, I ai
mltâeven in the face of obstacles. They
have received no help, they expect. none.
It. Is a great movement uprlnglng from
the desire on the part of our laboring
I claim that this alone Is going to add
more permnnuence to our welfare than
the largest trust In America to-day. An
other phase of unionism that in of great
benefit is the moral Influence of the
unions. â¢ â¢ â¢ Opponents of unions say
that union men, when they get higher"
wages and shorter hours, spend the
money and the time gained in saloons.
I- admit that some laborers do this as
well as some doctors and merchants. But
the whole tendency of unions Is against
this. â¢ 'Â¦â¢ â¢ Still another good feature of
labor unions Is that they are benevolent
societies largely. They do the same kind
of work that Is done by the Odd Fellows,
the Knights of Pythias . and other iJtenev
olent organizations. ' The members pay
a certain sum weekly and are entitled to
receive money when sick or disabled or
out of work. They also allow death ben
efits. This feature of the work of the la
bor . unions is certainly one of . great
value. Such benefit funds can be more^
wisely and 0 safely administered by the*
workmen of a single trade, who are close
ly associated and well acquainted, than
by persons less firmly allied in their in
terests.. â¢ ? Â¦*Â¦ The claim Is made - that
unions are usurping the powers of gov
ernment, that they constitute an impe
rlum in imoerio.
We accredit to (he patriotic, llberty
lovins people of our nation "the emanci

been working fourteen hours, as tho
street railway employes in Baltimore
were until the unions reduced It to ton
hours, how many would you expect to
llnd there? And If their WOÂ£M were pnt
sufficient for them to wear fairly good

Â«=?pWICE have the stalwart debaters of the Lodi High School gone
down to the college town of Palo Alto and wrestled with valiant
U opponents for the Stanford debating cup, and twice have they .re
turned to their friends at home crowned -with the laurels of success. Ons
more winning and the highly prized and much-coveted cup goes to Lodi
to stay. . â¢
Two years ago the student body of Stanford offered a silver cup
as a trophy to the Debating League of Northern California. About six
teen high schools belong to this league and any one of them would
give their eye teeth, individually or collectively, to win the cup. In* or-,
dei to make the test absolutely fair the rule was established, that tho cup
should only gt> to that high school that could win it three times. Thj
first tournament was won by the Humboldt Evening High School of this
city and they took the cup to ho'd until defeated. Lodi- was not repre
sented in the first debate, but in the second tournament it was there in
full force, and defeated every team that came against it; -
The atmosphere at 'Lodi seems to be especially good for the de
velopment of debaters. Witness tho following record: In, February of
last year Eva Beckxnan, Charles F." Lillie and Irving Vickerson de
feated the representatives of Stockton High School; in April, the Low
ell High School of San Francisco fell before Luther Brown. Charles J>\
Lillie and Irving Vickerson; again in October Lodi out-debated the Oak
land Evening High School, the winding team this time being Charles F.
Lillie, Joe Priestly and Will T. Gehan. This same trio triumphed in tlio
recent debate at Stanford and for tht second time took the cup back to
Lodiâ all to the chagrin of the Humboldt Evening High School, whose
men put up a royal fight, but wero outclassed by the splendid team work
and telling arguments of their opponents.
Lodi can now rest easy on its laurels until next September, when
the next debate will be held at Stanford. Then the young debaters
must be prepared to do or die, for if they win the cup all the attendant
plory and honor are theirs for all time. The recent debate took place in
the chapel at the Stanford Univeisity and was presided over by M. FJ
KcCormick, the president of the student body. The judges were Pro
fessors Whittier (law), Newcomer (English) and Starbuck (education).
The speakers from Humboldt were George Cressy, Thomas Forsythe and
George Presly, and they had the affirmative side of the question "Re
colved, That labor unions are detrimental to the welfare of the United
States." Humboldt made a clever fight and the speakers individually
were particularly brilliant, but Lodi won the verdict easily by the clev
er manner in which each speaker had msde his argument an aid to,
nnd a part of. the speeches of his two fellow-debaters. Not one of the
Lodi debaters' speeches was inteuded to be complete in itself, but all
vlirec taken together made a perfect argument upholding the labor union
ps not detrimental to the welfare of the United States.
Below are given the most striking parts from the speeches of the
ton e Lodi debaters in the order as they appeared before their judges at
Stanford. First 1b presented the summary of the points shown in their
debate. This, as a matter of fact, termed the end of the argument of the
last debater, Will T. Gehan, but wo hav6 purpossly placed it in this posi

It is a question that only the years

WHAT BECOMESTHE SUNDAY CALL,.
THE Kappa Alpha Thetas of five
years back have scattered to the
four winds. They are traveling,
teaching, going the social pace,
married. They are spread over two
continents and the islands besides.
Anna Hammond, the handsome brunette
of the frat. was musically gifted besides
being handsome. She was in earnest in
music, too. and she is now in Boston
lurrying on the study.
The two Wickson girls have always been
among the most popular of the "Kats,"
and proof of this was shown when Ednah
was elected grand president of the na
tional Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority. It
was a big honor to California, to the
Berkeley Chapter and to Miss Wickson,
and the girls have been a mighty proud
lot ever since. Her sister, KIttv. is de
voting herself to society and showing
that the co-ed Is not of necessity a sober
blue-stockir.g.
Marlon Whipple is teaching in Waila
Walla. Susie Clark is another on the
teaching list; she is in Honolulu, where
she draws a good salary at the same Lids
that she Is having ali the privileges that
the tourist has in visiting much-heard-of
epots.
Fannie 8tone is teaching In Lodl and
Mary Maxwell In the southern part of the
State. Perhaps they are better off than
the Honolulu teacher, after all, for they
are nearer the home chapter, and it
there is a loyal being on this earth it Is
the frat girl, and if there is a thing thai
girl loves it is to "round up" with the
chapter at the old frat house for a cozy
visit at what was once and never shall
cease to be her own hearthstone.
Of the married Thetas there is Mrs.
Malcolm Graham, who used to be Manie
Kent. She married a gallant captain In
the United States army and followed him
to the Philippines, where he is still on
duty. She has had the most romantic
career of the old crowd.
Agnes Borland married Walter Hart and
is now living in Boston.,
Lucretia Watson Is also on the man fed
list. As Mrs. Grant Taylor she is living
in San Jose, which mean? that she can
still keep in touch with the Berkeley
Chapter.
The ether girls are living at home.
Isahel Godin is in Los Angeles. Ruin

Washington and Lincoln led our nation
over its most difficult paths. It has been
left in recent years for such men as Theo
dore Roosevelt to embody the highest
Ideals of private and public citizenship.
The Constitution of the United States of
America has put a new meaning Into the
word citizenship. The high ideals of the
fathers of our country have laid the
foundations of good citizenship in such a
way that the industrious, high-minded,
ambitious men and women of all nations
have flocked to our shores. The present
prominence of our nation among the na

usefulness and power have given to
American citizenship a fresh inspiration
toward true living and great accomplish

Mr. H. C. Chatford-Taylor is about to
publish a new novel, upon which hejhas
been at work for nearly two 1 years* It
is to be called "The Crimson Wlngr." r an<l
will be Issued in February by Messrs.
Herbert S. Stone & Co. The subject is a
more serious one than this writer has
undertaken in other novels, as the Franco-
Prussian War forms the background. The
two heroines are French, but the hero la
a German, and this gives an opportunity
for effective contrasts and exciting; situa
tions.
" 'Oh, scarcer. Well, Jimmy thought the old
lady had lived long enough â eighty years,
really, are pretty good Innings â and he gave
her Insect powder in her barley water.' "

degree of clevernessâ of a certain sort.

like." (Published by D. Appleton & Co.,

unconscious knowledge before it can be

On the right of poetry to be considered
an educational agent, at once humanizing
and uplifting. Miss Whiting cannot speak
in sufficiently high praise. On the subject
of the place of poetry in the Ideal system
of education she says:
"There are poets whose voices call to us
from the starry spaces and who give to
us the clew to the meaning of life; who
relnsplre us with courage and hope, with
patience and persistence, which should
always be united, and with that faith

In pursuance of the putpoec In vlÂ»?w.
Mb* Whiting enumerates tÂ».e different
typti of books which have had a potent
influence In the development of the race,
tn the case of certain bonks their con
tents nre outlined, while from others quo
tmionsof the most striking passages are
iriven. In the first chapter there is put
forth a strong plea for the necessity of a
{udk-ious- selection of books to be read by
the young. The author says very wisely:
"There Is much In even the greatest lit
erature that a child in the nursery may
easily learn to appreciate and love. Fa
miliarity with noble thought and beautiful
expression influences . the subconscious
nature to a degree of unguessed potency,
and irresistibly leads the spirit thus finely
touched onward to all fine issues. Num
berless are the passages in Shakespeareâ '
as the description of Cleopatra's barge,
1 he scene of the witches' heath In "Mac
beth," the forum in "Julius Caesar"â
which will enthrall the imagination of the
<J:ilu and enlist a far deeper Interest than
does the silly and meaningless rhyme too
often thrust upon juvenile reader?.
* â¢ â¢ This is the fortunate time,
indeed, to familiarize the mind with a
large proportion of that literature of the
past for which the crowded years of later
lire have little leisure. The HKS'.mllative
power of the child's mind for much of the
best in all literature is usually underesti
mated. The storlt-H of the lives of great
men are recognized as a part of the men
tal culture of youth, and to these can be
added ihow of the Impressive figures of
crt and literature, as well as the heroes of
action. â¢ â¢ â¢ If comprehensive knowl
edge of that which is best In the
world of books, united with Judicious se
lection and unfaltering attention, can but
lead a child onward Into literature, any
tjlrl or boy should, by the age of sixteen,
be well grounded In all the various
branches of literary activity. Yet it Is by
no means uncommon to find, high school
and college graduatesâ young people
equipped with all the technique of schol
arshipâwho are yet strangely unfamiliar
with literature. It Is not going too far to
say that if thla familiarity Is not a grow
ing poBsesKion, from the nursery up, it
can never be absolutely acquired. For
literature must be assimilated into " life
and contribute to that reservoir of the
which is the substance of things not seen.
* â¢ â¢ Poets, who ; hold over us this
high dominion inspire the >. conditions on
which 'Maeterlinck insists; when he says:
" 'We should live as*if'We.,wjere always^
on the evÂ« pf the g^reat revelation, and we'
should be ready * with welcome.' with
warmest and keenest and': fullest, most
heartfelt and intimate welcome.' And
what the. form if shall take on. the day
IN "The World Beautiful In Books,"
Liilian Whiting's latest work, there
is much which many will find not
only interesting but helpful as
well; The book is an inquiry
into the part which literature plays
in helping to build up the spiritual na
ture of man. Miss Whiting first discusses
those intellectual and spiritual needs of
man. which he must satisfy, if he is to
reach the highest development of which,
hells capable; and then shows how the
various kinds of books can help toward â¢
the satisfaction of those needs. In the.
introductory portion of the work the au
thor says of its purpose:
"Literature and life are so absolutely
interpenetrated that they can only â¢ 1* ,
regarded in the lig..t of a series of cause;,
and effect, each reacting upon the other
in determining: influence. By the magic
of some 'spiritual alchemy reading; -is
transmuted into tbc qualities which build
up character, and these qualities in turn
determine the further choice of books, so
that selection and result perpetuate them
selves, forming an unceasing contribution
to pocial influence. If a man's life is but
ilv- sum of the expression of his thought .
the very power and the degree of this
thought depend largely' on his range of
reading. Books are thus intimately asso
ciated with the very springs of character,
and a man's biography is recorded in a
library that has grown with his thought
and is the expression of his intellectual
evolution. Tho book that he has lived
with and associated with -certain phases
of growth becomes a part of his essential
life. â¢ â¢ â¢
that it comes to us, the best -way of all to
prepare for its fitting reception is to crave
for it now, to desire it as lofty, as perfect,
as vast, as ennobling as the soul can con
ceive.' - . , , â¢' â¢â¢' . â¢ ' ."Â¦ ';â¢ ; Â¦
"Of the ppets who*spea"k to the spirit-
Dante, Milton, Goethe, Shelley,
worth, Tennys'pn' and Browningâ no one
has ' given more , impassioned expression to
that ideal which. beckons on .beyond sun
and star than his Shelley in his "Prome
theus Unbound.* H is a poem. so great in
its mysterious, incalculable force, that it
comes to be, not alone an imaginative cre
ation, but a human document, mirroring
thedetpest experiencesjfcfjlifei- *
"The degree. to which one is \ enabled to
dominate his own ,;life; in. the sense of. con
trolling ;an(J selecting - and - grouping;. ,lta
btitcri events is precisely fm proportion to
the spiritual . power â¢ he has -achieved, and
this power depends i largely on^ his choice
and range of reading.^ *â¢Â¦â¢ "Â¦Â¦*' The 'inner
life, that is- Ufedâ the "life . of . reading,
tnought, aspiration, p'urposeand prayer
dominates and determines the outer li-fe.
It creates- it. 'And when one;feeft help
lessly drifting. at the mercy of events his
only safety lies in -a more positive . and
abounding energy; in deeper purpose and
firmer grasp on his Intellectual life, a
higher and diviner trend to his thought
and a closer clinging to the divine prom
ises. - *..... ,
"Nor is the result hardly less Indebted
to the literature of belles lettres than to
that qf ethics: for spirituality, that high
est degree of energy, is the product : of
both intellectual und moral culture, of
taste and refinement blended with aspira
tion and high -purpose." Â»
A wide range of reading in the novel is
-advocated aa a. means of giving needed
relaxation of mind and of helping toward
a better understanding of the complex
phases of human character. Hooks by the
best writers on Â¦ scientific subjects Miss
Whiting .considers at. scarcely ; less value
us an aid toward widening tU* spiritual
outlook than works devoted exclusively to
ethics and fellglrin.' For, m cording to WÂ»n
Whiting'* view, there Is no-reul contllct

Professor H. R-- Fairclough told an ap

"A Trip Through Canada."
The. petitioner asserts that Pease owes
her ward $450 due her under the terms of
Ogle's will. Ogle died In 1876, leaving an
estate worth 17000. In his will 'he directed
that $30 per month be paid his sister out
of -the income from the. estate. This
amount was paid by ' Pease up to fifteen
.months ago, when for some unknown rea
son, says Mrs. Hills, the payment ceased.
She: claims .that Pease has never filed an
account of receipts and disbursements,
and asks the court to compel him to show
cause why he should not do so. . .-.

On Friday morning of last 'week, after
an absence of two months, "Jack" was
seen hovering above the Larco home and
as usual his companion was along. The
late- etdrm started almost
and continued a week. -. Â¦Â¦ .
After remaining at - home for several
months "Jack" : again departed for sea
and was absent, this time fully six
months. It returned again and as before
brought a companion. On this occasion,
as before, the' companion could not be In
duced to alight. Following "Jack's" ar
rival another southeast storm began and
continued until." several inches of rain
had fallen. . .
During the dry year of 1S98 the bird was
away nine 'months. It returned Just be
fore a severe storm In the following year.
On each and every occasion rain. has fol
lowed its arrival. I .
Tho next day after "Jack's" arrival a
strong southeast wind set in and within
a few hours a terrific storm was in pro
gress. Rain began falling and continued
for several days. At the time of the
bird's return nothing .was thought of its
connection' with . the approaching storm,
but incidents have sinco occurred that
prove conclusively that the approaching
storm was the 0 cause of Â¦ tho pelican's
home-coming. .
..SANTA : BARBARA. March Lâ Santa
Barbara has a queer but never-failing
weather prophet, whose warnings of ap
proaching storms will hereafter bo util
ized, by shipping men and fruit growers..
Several years ago Captain' Seba3tian
Larco, while fishing near the Santa Rosa
Island, captured a young pelican. The
bird was brought to this city and given a
homo at the Larco residence. It was al
lowed its liberty immediately, and sur
prising to say, became domesticated at
once, i . .
Forlmonths "Jack." as he was named,
remained about the place and was the
pet of the entire family. Tourists visiting
the city were greatly interested In the
bird and many were the visitors that ad
mired the curious pet.. : â ' Â» ..
One day while a number of interested
visitors were looking at him "Jack" quite
unexpectedly flew to sea. Its departure
caused sorrow at the Larco home, as it
was generally believed that" the pet had
been seen for the 'last time. This was a
mistake, however. Two months later, ac
companied by anqther pelican, it was
seen circling around the house. It did
not light at this time,' but again flew to
sea. , About an hour, later it v returned,
this time alone, and safely, alighted in the
yard. It was as tame as' ever and could
be handled as before. Â¦

the action taken by the board. At the

Hall was filled with frienas and oppo
nents of the measure. .
The members of the board acted unani
mously In advertising the franchise for
eale and likewise adopted a resolution
permitting the company to use the public
streets for laying gas pipes to supply the
inhabitants with gas light. This last ac
tion was taken under a constitutional
provision and Is entirely distinct from
the statutory proceeding authorizing the
sale of a franchise for supplying ga3 for
heat and power. This latter will be sold
on April 28 at 8 p. m. and probably will
realize a large sum. : ~ v "_ ,,, . .
At the present Â«tlme the Consolidated

will bid on the franchise a sum that will

treasury.

Seven bodies had been recovered and
five injured were brought to town when
a second slide came down in the path of
the first, killing two more men and in
juring a number of others. This was fol
lowed by two more snowslides, in which
five livejs were sacrificed. As the storm
still continued and the work of rescue
could only be carried on under extreme
danger to the living and as it was be
lieved that no more of those buried under
the snow could still be alive if was de
cided to abandon the. search for bodies
until it can be - prosecuted with greater
safety.
Vr. J. Q. Allen and Dr. C. W. Clancy,
who went up to attend the victims of the
first snowslide. were caught in the sec
ond. The former sustained severe inju
ries about his lower limbs and the latter
escaped uninjured." Both -were carried
dovn a distance of more than fifty feet
but managed to extricate themselves. '
It had been snowing for three days and
the snow and fog were so dense when the
slide came down that it was utterly im
possible for one to see ten feet ahead.
The accident broke the telephone circuit
and several hours elapsed' before a mes
senger reached town with tidings of the
disaster. All the doctors available and
many citizens hurried up the mountain
to lend assistance in digging out the dead
and injured. . . . ,-' ' :
F. C. Clemmer, the timekeeper at the
mine, who was killed; it is said, was sit
ting at his desk and making out the time
of the employes when the crash came
and all the books of the company record
ing the names of those on the pay roll
were destroyed. The exact number' of
men who were caught in this slide is not
known, but there were probably not iess
than thirty in the bunkhouse and board
ing-house when they were swept away.
Fortunately a large majority of the 2aO
miners employed in the Liberty Bell mine
were either in the underground workings
or absent in town at the time of the ac
cident. â¢ ... . .
He had Just come from b.reakfast and
was in the stable saddling hla animals
when he heard a terrific crashing and
rattling. The stable grew suddenly as'
dark as night. Stepping, to the door be
opened it and found the outside tbtaliy
dark and the air filled with flying snow.
Thinking it was- a terrific gust of wind,
he slammed the etabie door shut and
waited a fe"w seconds. He peered through
a crack, and as it grew lighter again he
opened the door and saw. the tram cable
swinging about and buckets rolling down
the hiil.
As the snow in the air settled he
stepped out a few feet, and looking up
toward the boarding and bunk houses
could see no signs -of these build
ings. Then, looking down the hill, he
saw boards and timbers sticking out of
the snow and scattered about. He then
,went up to the ore and tram house, or
where it .had stood, and saw what he
thought was a piece of overalls. Grasp
ing it and attempting to pull it out, lie
found he had hold of a man's body.
Tearing away" the snow and boards, he
pulled out the body of Gus Kraul. The
body was terribly mangled and the head
crushed until it was no thicker than the
two hands laid flatly together. He then,
started toward the boarding-house ana
met his brother. Charlie Umsted, who
told him what. had happened. Chanle
was employed in the boarding-house, and
escaped by being out at the time after a
bucket of water. _
The most lucid account of the first snow
slide, which carried away the boarding
and bunk'houscs and other buildings of the
Liberty Bell mine. In Cornet Creek Basin,
three and a half miles north of this city,
and buried their occupants in the gulch
under masses of show and debris, was
given by L. M. Umsted, who is employed
In packing ore from acrusher to the tram
station.

DANGERS
OF COUGHS
CONTRACTED IN MARCH..
A couch contracted la March (no mat-
ter bow slight) Is far more dangerous
than at any other eeason of the year, and
for theso reasons. The blood at this sea-
son Is thick, heavy, sluggish and unable
to throw ctC disease germs. The throat
and lung's, irritated from coughs and
colds, are In a weakened condition and,.
ready to receive and nourish the millions
of consumptive, catarrh and - bronchitis
germs which have lain dormant all win-
ter and are now being dried and blown
Into the air by the March winds.
Every breath you Inhale Is filled with
these germs. If they are allowed to re-
main on the Inflamed membrane, they be-
cln to multiply with great rapidity, and
It Is thus that caXarrh. bronchitis, pneu-
monia and consumption are contracted.
Formerly there was no possible way of
preventing this infection, but to-day it is
only through carelessness and neglect
that such diseases can be contracted. '
.A. few moments' inhalation of the new
dry air germicide, Hyomei. morning and
night, will destroy every disease germ
taken Into the throat and lungs during
the day, and It is through this method
only that tuch germs can be reached and
destroyed.
To breathe Hyomei means certain death
to all germs of respiratory diseases. It
is only a question, of timeâ depending
upon how deeply these germs have be-
come Imbedded, when Hyomei will reach
them and destroy them.
Common coughs .are cured In twenty-
tour hours.
Croup germs are destroyed In one hour.
The germs of catarrh, bronchitis and
consumption are completely eradicated in
a few weeks. All you have to do is to
breathe Hyomei for ten minutes, morn-
ing, noon and night.

The politicians and writer â¢ however, are
beginning to examine his visit from the
standpoint of class and party views. The
Socialists revile everything about the trip
from their double hatred of royalty and
wealth. They sneer at the "democracy

unaffected bearing, affirming that royalty
at home Is never so amiable. New names
for the United States besprinkle : the So
cialist press, such as "Dollar Republic,"
and the papers call those who took part in
the luncheon with the Prince at Sherry's,

DID/NOT KNOW SHE
HAD KIDNEY TROUBLE
Thousands^ Have Kidney Trouble
and Nev^r Suspect It.
Gcptpudc Warner Scott Cured by the Great
Kidney Remedy, Swamp-Root.
. â¢ 'â¢ Vlnton, Iowa, July 15th, 1901
DR. KILMER & CO., Binghamton, N. T.
Gentlemen â In the summer of 1893, I was taken violently HI. My trouble be>-
. gan with pain in my stomach and back, so severe that it seemed as it knives
were cutting me. I was treated by two of the beat physicians In tha county,
and consulted another. None of them suspected that the cause of my trouble
was kidney disease. They all told mo that I had cancer of the stomach, and
would die. I grew so week that I could not walk any more than a child a
month old, and I only weighed sixty pounds. One day my brother saw In a
paper your advertisement of Swamp-Root, the rreat kidney remedy. HÂ« bought
me a bottle at our drug store and I took it. My family could see a change In
me, for the better, so they obtained more and I continued the use of Swamp-
Root regularly. I was so weak and run dortn that It took considerable time
to build me up again. I am now well, thanks to Swamp-Root, and weigh 143
pounds, and am keeping house for my husband and brother on a farm. Swamp-
Root cured me after the doctors had failed to do me a particle of good.
(Gertrude Warner Scott.)
Â¦ Â¦Women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not cor-
rectly understood; in many cases when doctoring they are led to believe that
womb trouble or female weakness of some sort Is responsible for their Ills,
when In fact disordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.
The mild and extraordinary effect of the world-famous kidney and bladder
remedy, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Is soon realized. It stands the highest for Its
wonderful cures of the most distressing cases. A trial will convince anyoneâ
and you may have a sample bottle sent free, by mall. â¢

EDITORIAL NOTEâ If you have the slightest symptoms of kidney or blad-
der trouble,- or If there Is a trace of It In your family history, send at once to
Dr. Kilmer & Co., Blnghamton, N. T., who will gladly send you by mail, im-
mediately, without cost to you, a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, and a book
telling all about Swamp-Root and containing many of the thousands upon thou-
sands of testimonial letters received from men and women cured. La writing
to Dr. Kilmer & Co.. Blnghamton, N. Y., be sure to say that you read this
generous offer in the San Francisco Sunday Call.
If you are already convinced that Swamp- Root is what you need, you can
purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-dollar size bottles at the drug stores
everywhere: Don't make any mistake, but remember the name, Swamp-Root.

The oil consumption of the Southern

present year amounted to 910,000 gallons.
This meant, aa compared to the cost of

amount of energy, a saving of 123.000 to

to result In a saving of from $60,000 to
$100,000 per month, or, approximately,
$1,000,000 per annum. The Southern Pa

The American Mecca Company at Mc-
Kittrick In its exploitation of terrjtory
is reported to have struck a fine flow
of water at a depth of 140 feet. Accord
ing to the Bakerufteld Cajlfornlan, the
managers of the company are highly
elated for the reason that there Is sucn
a scarcity of water in the field that a
good water well will prove to be more
valuable than an oil well. The supply
Is supposed to be sufficient to warrant
the establishment of a water plant.

THE MOTDOO OASES.
IN the iailure to convict Brown it becomes evident that none of the Modoc murderers can
be convicted, no matter what the evidence against them. It is a part of our system of law
that the State cannot remove a. criminal case to/another county by change of venue With
out such change none of these men can be punished.. The law is a wise one. It is intended
to make each community responsible for the crime committed within its borders, by putting uipon
it the duty of punishment. If it fail in this duty, then it suffers punishment.
We do not suppose that those concerned in this affair in Mt>doc County care much for
public opinion. They do not wince at knowing that their county has a stain upon its fame but the'
stain is there just the same. The law wisely left, them free to say whether they. would punish 1 mur
der or not. They have used their option by putting a premium upon that crime, refusing its pun
ishment and standing; together to prevent justice. They need find no fault if others regard them
as deliberately assenting that their county shall bear the reputation they have made for it The rest
of the State, through State officials, sought to, vindicate the law in Modoc. This clea-s the people
of all the other counties of all responsibility. and vindicates the general law-abiding 'character of
the commonwealth. ...Further than this the State' cannot go. Its^hands'are tied.

murders were committed,^ in the night and darkness. The guilty men are as well known as ; the
name* of, the county in which they live. The Jury .. knew them; and after Wearing to d6 its dutv

for lawlessness will be 'Modoc justice?' .... V . . \- ." " , " Â¦

Of an age touching Beethoven's and
Schubert's, Mr. Holmes' life is rich in
memories and traditions. His father, who
himself could not play a note, was his only
teacher, with such success that Henry,
with his brother Alfred, were touring the
Continent in concerts at the early ages
of 15 and 17, respectively. Their father
took the boys to Bpohr, on one of Spohr's
London visits, and the author of the cele
brated violin school had nothing but
praise for the curiously educated youths.
They toured for ten or twelve years, ap
pearing in Paris. Brussels, at the Lelpslc
GewtndhauB, in Sweden. Denmark, and
various other cities, and then came for
Henry Holmes a long and honorable Lon
don career. He originated the "Musical
Evenings." where the choicest chamber
rauBlc was given In choicest fashion, be
fore one of the most muslclanly coteries
that ever gathered together. Here Mil
Holmes Introduced the mighty e'ant
Brahms to English' audiences, and all
that was best In classic and contemporary
literature was sure of' sympathetic ear
eplredâ imaginings. , He loves well the
place of his adoption, its physical beauty,
its freedom and young genius; and be
lieves with a great belief in its future.
And the old musician has found an en
viable place in the affections of his West
ern confreres. Both as artist and man he
has won the respect and love of all who
are fortunate enough to know him, and
these things have combined to leave him
without regret, though not without the
ever-present memory of the classic shades
from which he came.
THS most eminently picturesque fig
ure in the local musical world is the
venerable English violinist, Henry
Holmes, whose fine old face, with
its eetting of illustrious locks, has
been a familiar sight to the city concert
goer for some few years past. It is the
quaintest romance â with which perhaps I
have no public businessâ how the charm
ing old artist, product of a statelier day
and ancient civilization, left London a few
years back to come to the crude New
World of the West, with his violin under
his arm. his family and all that is his. It

TALKS INTERESTINGLY OF
HER ART.

AMONG the new powers with which scientists are seeking tb endow mankind -is that of
providing light without heat. The demand for such an art can hardly be called urgent,
-but still it would manifestly be of advantage to us. It would enable us to illumine our
rooms and theaters without unduly heating them during the warm nights of. summer, and
in other ways be beneficial. It is said that in the ordinary gas burner only about threeper cent of
the energy expended .is converted into light. The. rest is heat. Even the. best burners and incan
descent mantles hardly furnish more than thirteen per cent of light. It will be seen that from gas
we get too much heat when we are' seeking after light, and electricity does not furnish much
better results.
The experiments thus far made in the direction of producing an illumination without heat
are not encouraging to the general public, but scientists are said to be fairly well pleased with
â¢ them. Professor Gorham of Brown University has found that if beef be kept long enough under
conditions which permit decomposition along certain natural lines it will become \ luminous and
emit rays strong enough to make a photograph. The experiments are the outcome, of the well
known phenomena of phosphorescence. The glow of decaying meat is due to a species of bacteria,
and Professor Gorham is reported to have found that by separating these organisms from their
â¢ original environment and feeding them in glass flasks containing gelatine, with certain kinds of
salts, they become far more luminous than when feeding on beef. Thus it appears we are coming
within measurable distance of the desired light!
It will be a curious condition of affairs if we should ever arrive at a time when our homes
and cities are lighted with bacteria instead of with electricity, but there is no telling what the next
generation is coming to. If the new light prove successful, and the gelatine flask full of micro
organisms take the place of the electric light, we shall have the satisfaction of having taught the
art to our descendants ancKcast its beams upon them; if on the other hand it fail, the blame will
be on them for not having profited by our experiments with beef. \;-:fy [

fact that our own symphony orchestra
gives its last concert of the season next
.Friday. Wet weather and the general
"cussedncss" of things have combined to
play sad havoc with the last two con
certs, and the directors of the society are
shaking their heads over symphony mat
ters. If the Stelndorff orchestra goes un
der we shall not deserve even to hear the
name of symphony for a penitential pe
riod of ten years. Granted ! that Mr.
Stelndorft is not a Rlchterâ that It is pos
sible some people have the vanity to de
mand-he is yet the best that lies to oiir
hand, and a musician of accomplishment,
with a positive genius for the handling of
men. He has done good work in face of
very discouraging circumstances, and is
entitled to a large degree of gratitude,
respect and earnest Bupport. We have
given the Rosenbecker orchestraâ as Is
perfectly properâ a hearty support, but it
is several times more important to our
musical welfare to give the local band the
benefit of our service.
Next Friday's concert is the last of the
season and a fitting and proper time to
ehow appreciation of Mr. StelndorfTs ef
forts. The programme is good and it is to
be hoped, that every one who cares at all
about the future of music In this commu

and exquisite interpretation. Another not
able sphere of activity for the violinist
was the Royal College of Music, where
Mr. Holmes taught the art of violin play
ing and conducted the college orchestra.
Again, he has contributed importantly to
the musical literature of the day, with
two symphoniesâ "Fraternity" and "Bos
castle"âmany compositions for strings,
cantatas and other works, besides a lav
ishly edited edition of the Spohr "school."
Mr. Holmes' career here is well known,
his pure and delicate art and unswerving
devotion to the highest Ideals generously
recognized. He has lately been ill, of a
long and painful Illness, and to mark their
esteem and the festive day of his re
covery a small army of the best musicians
has combined to give him a testimonial
concert this Week. He knows nothing yet
or their generous purpose, nor will until
after the event, and it is now "up to you"
and to me to see that there shall be some
thing for the venerable artist worth hear
ing when he does know. The musicians
nave done their part, as the following
generous programme amply testifies:

She greeted me cordially and after pull
ing out a chair for me. seated herself. So
did I, and suddenly became conscious of
hitherto unsuspected . angles and a
congenital awkwardness of the most
aggravated description. I looked at
Pilar Morln. There was not a
wrong line . about her from the
carnations that crowned her dusky hair
to the tips of her little French toes. The
angle of the head would have drlvenl Sar
gent distracted, her arms might have been
posed by Carolus Duran and the curve
from hip to ankle would have Inspired a
Parisian Phidias to marble ecstacies. I
am free to confess that I watched the
little lady with malice intent to discover
if the pose were' for interviews only. But
through a period of several minutes of a
conversation rather distrait I found that
Mme. .'Morln was Just* as graceful and
apropos in one' pose as another, and at
last I blurted out:
"Do you know how you' look Just this
minute?"
'.'Mais non! You mean do I think how
I look when I talk with you? Not at all.
But ,1 know now this minute when you
ask me exactly how I look to youâ the
audience. I should know, for that is my
life work. The actor who has not learned
that has not learned the beginning of this
art," " and Mme. Morin fell into another
pose that made me long for a pencil and
the sense to wield it.
"But do not think that I think I can
sing," the piquant little lady finally Im
plored. And I promised her I wouldn't.
I had seen Pllar Morln only at long
range before the other day and found her
prettier In the full sunshine than behind
the footlights. She has a face of endless
possibilities, with Its large, round eyes,
black, sparkling and accomplished, deli
cately arched brows, mobile lips and sen
sitive nostrils. But I hardly think .t
would make much difference to Pllar Mo
rip what kind of face she had. She can
make one think that she has any sort of
face she needs for the moment, And I am
not at all sure that I know' anything
about It, only so far as the eyes go. I
swear to the eyes.
I WAS probably not the only person
surprised to find on Fischer's Hat of
musical couudliinn thin week tho
name of Mme. Pllar Morln. the
French pantomtmlst that Daly sent
out to us hero in "IVEnfant Prqdlgue." In
the dnva of the old Baldwin Theater.
Among those ourprlocd la Pllar Morln her
self, who had vowed never, no, never? to
use her pretty little volcelet In public,
without any effect, however, upon Man
ager Frlcdlander's Intentions, she told
mo no the other day when I went to aee
her In the modest little suite that she now
calls home, and seemed' more deslroua
that I should understand this small fact
than any other one thing In her artistic
history. I told her what I thought, that

and that there is more â¢ to follow with

It is worth while for teachers and school officers to reflect that the school days of Ameri
can youth are the formative period for lasting sentiment toward that which is manly, that which
is excellent and of good report, and that this influence may proceed from lessons learned, rather
than from dry criticism,\analysis: and routine.
John Hay has himself produced much noble literature in poetry and prose, and from his
fond reference to the fountain no longer affluent in the old school reader it is evident that he goes
back to that source as the first inspiration of his muse and the model of that good taste and ex
pressive method of which he is a master.
Ihese were the readers referred to- by Mr. Hay. Iney were full of patriotic, history ana
poetry. Pitt's reply to Walpole was a peculiar stimulant to youthful ambition. Wirt's description '
of the blind preacher was a" lesson in faith and religion that is to-day an influence in many a life
that is drawing toward the end. "Tell and the eagle taught respect for freedom afid.for all life."Pat
rick Henry's speech to the Burgesses fixed in man) a youth the highest style of oratorical expres
sion, and shrill more firmly impressed a. lesson in patriotism. Hamlet's soliloquy promoted philos
ophy of mind, and Adrian's address to his soul excited a lov^e of the classics and gave birth to sober
reflections upon the ineffable and unseen; â¢ " , '
Scores of other selections examined now by the; critical eye reveal the old school reader as
an educator in all that is best in taste^nncl highest among the proper motives of life arid rules of
human conduct. It is'remembeted, too, that in the study of those books their most important
use \va$ considered by the teacher to. be the imparting of the sentiment expressed in their selec- *
tions. Their pages were not peppered with diacritical marks. Pervaded by the sentiment the %
young reader's own impulse and emotion soon adapted manner and style of reading to the
lesson conveyed by the text, and his love of what he read was not evaporated in weary training
in the modulation, inflection and emphasis, which came to him as the natural expression of feel- -
ing. In these modem days the fine sentiment of Milton, Mncnulay and other masters of style in
literary expression is lost by using them, as grammar lessons, and compelling a dissection that
destroys their sentiment."
True we have more books and they! ;>re more accessible than in those days, but one may
well wish there were fewer books and |)ett^r. It was a fine generation that was inspired by those
old readers. One can hardly find a gray man or woman whose life began before the middle of the
last century that cannot Â»repeat from memory lines from Tell and the apple. Casabianca, Marco
Boz2aris, Burke on the American Colonists, Webster's reply to Haync, and nearly alt the lessons
in reading which were s thc pleasure and delight of their school days. But none of them can sit
down and mark every letter with its proper diacritical value. If the present generation retain to .
its close the critical analysis of a reading lesson, at the expense, of its sentiment, it will still be lack
ing in something that adorned and dignified and enriched its predecessor.
JOHN HAY'S description of the conditions from which President McKinley emerged to
* fame and passed into enduring history strikes a responsive chord in the memory of a genera
tion that is passing away. . ).
A half century ago, especially in the West, there were not many books, but the few
in* possession of a frontier family were standard. The old \ school readers Were frequently the most
valuable part of the pioneer's literary, possessions. The first one remembered is the "Columbian
Orator," under which rather pretentious title were furnished a series of exercises in reading, that
formed an introduction to history, biography; and literature. When this was succeeded by the

SANTA CRUZ, March 1.â The Pescadero
stage had a narrow escape from a disas
ter yesterday, and that no lives were lost
is remarkable. Twenty miles up the
coast the stage travels along the beach,
which, at high tide, is often covered by
water. Yesterday the ocean was higher
than at any time ln thirty-five ye^rs. In
the center of the beach it is very rocky
and rough, with water on either side.
When Driver James Harvey reached this
point a monster wave dashed against the
stage and upturned it.
For two hours the horses, Harvey and
the single passenger, William Steele,
floundered in the cold waters of the Pa
cific. Fortunately both men were good
swimmers. The horses were cut loose and
found their way to dry land. . --â¢.
Help arrived and after several hours'
work the stage was turned over. It was
badly demolished. The vehicle weighed
1600 pounds and was hard to handle. The
top nad been broken off -by the wave, the
iron on the tongue snapped and the dou
ble-tree'brdken. The iron rim around the
hub struck the rocks with such terrlflo
force that it was bent as though of tin. ;â¢

found a piece of noat rock, which exam

The same afternoon he missed his footing
while shooting at some game and the bul
let from his rifle broke off a small piece
of rock in the hills some distance ahead
of* him. Curiosity led him to examine thl3
rock and It also proved to be copper.
These facts determined him to make a
thorough search for the ledge from which
the copper specimens came. He accord
ingly returned the next day with hl3 two
brothers and began systematic prospect
ing. Their search was rewarded by the
finding of a fifteen-foot ledge on the moun
tain side. Some parts of the ledge are
streaked by veins of native copper six
inches to a foot in width, which are 95 per

"Whether this eleventh hour exhibition
of concern for the welfare of the up-river
people will soften their pronounced op
position to Gage remains to be seen.
Daniel Kevane was most affable, if the
others were reticent. He took pains to
say through the newspapers that the
State would expedite matters all It could
toward paying its share for constructing
the Yuba dam, and that the reason the
administration hadn't acted before was
that It didn't have the chance.
Kevane Does the Explaining.
Gage is attempting to repair his shat
tered fences in the rural districts of
Northern California. He has riot failed to
notice that whenever the farmers or or
chardlsts in the upper part of the great
Sacramento Valley- have talked politics at
all they have, regardless of party affilia
tions, expressed their opposition to . him.
One of the great needs ot the wheat
growing and fruit-raising sections is the
completion of the Yuba dam, a few miles
above Marysville, the purpose of which is
to hold back permanently the- millions of
tons of mining debris which has accumu
lated in the Yuba River in the past thirty
years and which now with every freshet
washes down into the channel of the Sac
ramento River, impairing navigation, and
spreads at times or overflows upon valua
ble lands and blights their crops.
When the Congressional Committee on
Rivers and Harbors was here last spring
to see whether it should recommend that
Congress give $150,000 toward the- dam.
Governor Gage did not concern himself
enough about the interests of the farm
ers and orchardists to accompany the
Congressmen on the river trip, nor did he
take the trouble to acknowledge the invi
tation sent him by the Chamber of Com
merce to do so. On Thursday of this
week the people of Marysville were
dumfounded by the arrival there of a
party of special emissaries of the admin
istration, including Daniel Kevnne, secre
tary of the State Boar! of Examiners;
Dr. W. P. Mathews, secretary, of the
State Board of Health; W. W. Wag
goner, State Debris Commissioner,' and
Dr. W. J. Hanna, an employe of the
State Board of Health. As there was no
epidemic in Marysville, either present or
prospective, the townsfolk were nt a loss
to know what was the; occasion for the
visitation and the Gage missionaries vol
unteered no explanation to the general
public. A reporter suggested to Dr.
Mathews that he may. have come to
Marysville to feel the public pulse, but
the doctor failed to see the point of the
remark. Senator W. M. Cutter, another
faithful Gage adherent, joined the partv
and all took carriages for Smartsville. '
Gage Is Repairing Fences.
More than anything else, Clark wants
his warm personal friend and business
partner, Al P.' Booth, â¢ nominated for
County Coroner. Colonel J. B. Wright,
however, is disposed to recognize the
claim of the incumbent, George C. McMul
lln, for renomination and he cannot for
sake him without practically acknowledg
ing Clark as the dictator ln the councils
of the party. It might not be thought
that there should be a split ln the Repub
licnan organization of this county over
the recipient of a nomination for one
minor office, but such Is nevertheless
among the recognized probabilities. Â»
Governor Gage is interesting himself in
the situation only to the extent of mak
ing himself "solid" with both sides, in
the hope that whichever wins he will get
from it all he wantsâ a pledged delega
tion ln the State convention. His award
of the Bank Commissionership. to Colonel
J. B. Wright is deemed by the adminis
tration followers to have been a master
stroke. That equal honors do not await
Mayor George H. Clark at the hands of
Gage is said to be due to the fact. that
the genial Mayor wants nothing at pres
ent that the Governor can give. The
Mayor has been credited with having as
pirations for the nomination for Railroad
Commissioner, and he has not disclaimed
the ambition.
Booth-McMullen Contest.
There is great activity in political
circles over what is deemed the certain
prospect of the convention meeting here
and the efforts toward bringing about a
settlement between the two contending
factions in the local Republican forces are
being pushed with renewed vigor. As yet
there*, has been no reconciliation between
Mayor George H. Clark and Colonel J. B.'
Wright, who lead the differing factions,
but politicians predict that an agreement
will surely be reached within two weeks
at the farthest. Upon what terms such
an understanding is to be brought about,
however, not even the wisest of those "on
the inside" appear able to say.
SACRAMENTO. March 1.â It Is believed
to be practically settled that the coming
Republican State Convention will be held
in this city. Although the Republican
State Central Committee has not yet for
mally fixed upon the place, nevertheless
all of the members of the committee who
have been approached in the, interest of
the capital city have pronounced them
selves in favor of its claims and it is con
ttdently believed that the-battle ground of
the gubernatorial contest will soon be
transferred to Sacramento.

Now William. Lotts is looking for his
father's grave, but old timers say -his
search will prove fruitless. The Missouri
River by its gradual encroachments has
washed away the graves and the ashes
of the dead have years ago been washed
away to the Mississippi and then into
southern waters.
It was ln 1865 that the party left Helena
under the guidance of Nat W. Burrls, the
founder of old Gailatin City. The Terri
torial Legislature had authorized the es
tablishment of a new town- to be called
Ophlr, at the mouth of the Marias, and it
was for this purpose the men journeyed
thither. They laid out their crude town
site, and were making preparations to
erect a large warehouse. They were all
engaged in cutting logs in the thick tim
ber, just above tne Marias, unapprehen
sive of danger, when a band of Indians
under the command of Calf Shirt and
Mountain Chief descended upon them.
Every white man was slain and not a
brave bit the dust to pay for his treachery.
The most deplorable ' part of the affair
was that,, the day- after the tragedy, the
families of two of the murdered men ar
rived by boat from Weston, Mo., to make
their homes in Montana, only to be met
with the heartrending news that fathers
and husbands had been slain. The bodies
of the ten men were buried near where
they fell, at the foot of a high bluff along
the Missouri, on what is now J. D. Wolff's
ranch.
Lotts was only 2 years old at the time
his father, with, ten other men, made the
perilous trip into the Montana wilds and
fell victim to the treachery of the red
skins, the tragedy having occurred at the
mouth of the Marias, about twelve miles
below Fort Benton.
HELENA, Martin 1.â A -pathetic quest is
that of William Lotts of Gibson, 111., who
seeks the grave of his father, who was
killed by Indians many years ago In a
lonely part of what Is now Choteau
County. Lotts has written to Mayor
Crane of Fort Benton, beseeching thelat
ter's assistance.

"I cannot comprehend why a situation
which has been made so clear to the com
pany should have caused such a flurry
of excitement among its shareholders
when presented In th# form of an official
cablegram, unless they had construed tho
notification to mean that the Colombian
Government was not yet prepared with
Its terms of transfer to the Government
of the, United States."- .
WASHINGTON, March 1.â Dr. Silva,
the retiring Minister from Colombia, to
day made the following statement: '. . '
"The Panama Canal Company, through
Lrfimpre, its secretary general, and others,
was informed some thne ago that It could
close no deal involving the transfer of its
rights to any nation without first obtain
ing the assent of the Colombian Govern
ment, the grantor of its concession. This
matter was made very clear. The Colom
bian Government, gave the company the
right to Initiate negotiations looking to a
transfer of its rights to a nation, but
never to finally close such a deal.
The company's officials are annoyed at
the anti-American nonsense expressed at
yesterday's meetings of the shareholders
and explain that -the speakers were a
noisy few who regularly create trouble,
but who only hold a very small number
of shares. â¢ Â¦
The hope Is expressed that- the diffi
culty will be arranged and in the mean
while the company will maintain its'of
fer to sell . its property to . the United
States and' will continue the negotiations
on the subject. It is not considered prob
able here that Colombia will oppose the
sale of the canal property to the United
States after giving its assent at the open
ing of the negotiations and confirmation
of its approval of the negotiations having
been received In a letter from Senor Sll
va, the Colombian Minister at Washing
ton, to Admiral Walker, January 11. In
view of this letter it is considered that
IColombia is offering an affront to the
States by now opposing the trans
fer. . <

LONDON. March J. â The officials of Uie
BritUh Chartered South Africa Company, of
uhich Cecil Rhode* is managing director, deny
the report, circulated in the United States by
a news agency, of the death of Mr. Rhodes.
Lord Kitchener says that it is reported
that over a hundred Boers, killed or
wounded, were carried off after the at
tack on the blockhouse line February 24.
Those figures, however, cannot be veri
fied, so they are not Included In the total
of 81!.t. Apart from the losses of the NÂ«w
Zenlnnders, tho other British casuultloa
were enly one officer killed and four men
wounded. .
Oh the best Informed opinion the Pall
Mall Gazette prophesies the end of all
serious hostilities In South Africa, by Sep
tember and this is rather a pessimistic
than an optimistic view. Judging from
uqtJL Kitchener's progress this week and
the well-founded rumors, of General
Botha's personal inclination to surrender,
the practical end of tho struggle may con
siderably antedate September.
A curious light has been thrown on the
remount scandals by a high official of the
Government, who says that, whatever the
merits or the demerits of the case, it
would never have come up had not a pri
vate squabble arisen between the mem
bers of the House of Commons. Accord
ing to this statement one member sent
in a bid for horses, which was refused in
favor of a Newmarket firm. Against tha
latter the disappointed bidder and several
racing members of the House of Commons
had bitter grudges. A cabal waa formed,
quite regardless of party lines, and a de
termination was arrived at to make the
Government suffer for giving contracts to
a man who waa not in favor with the
aristocratic Parliamentary racing set.
These personal grievances apparently had
long been common talk In the lobby of the
House of Commons and tho bait thrown
to tho opposition by the disgruntled
Unionists was eagerly taken up with the
resulting exposition of the horse scandals.

The amendment which was not accepted
is that imposing the tonnage taxes of the

to accept the proviso connected with the
Senate limiting the operation of the Â»edi-

provision to declare simply that "no*"'per-
Bon in the Philippine Islands shall, under
the authority of the United States, bo

TACOMA, March l.âMaJpr Frank Terry,
Superintendent of the. Western Washing

Qulnault agency. lie reports that the set
tlers and shipping men on the coast are
making united efforts to have the Gov
ernment establish a light on Oranville
Point, three mllew from the agency of the
Quinault reservation. The location is
about midway between the lights at
Westport beach and on Destruction Isl
and. The lights are sixty miles apart.
Granville Point is a rocky projection
jutting out into the ocean, with a danger
ous reef. U has proved the destruction
of many vessels in the past. A life-saving
station in that locality will be asked for
also. The station probably will be located
somewhere near the mouth of Quinault

curing of a site comparatively easy.

This accentuated danger is probably ap
preciated in inner Cabinet circles, though
it is overlooked or intentionally ignored
by the leading conservative organs allied
with the Rothschilds. It is said that there
are several other papers in London await
ing a favorable opportunity to come out
in support of Lord Rosebery.
Important developments in the . cam
paign are not likely to occur in the im
mediate future. It is. understood that
Lord Rosebery and his allied Interests are
willing to wait until the verge of the next
election before Issuing a definite pro*
gramme, In the meanwhile creating such
weapons an the recently formed Liberal
League, influencing defections among tho
members of the House of Commons, both
from Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and
the Liberal Unionists, to Lord Roiebery'M
platform of cfllciency, imperialism and
liberal economics.
Lord Rosetoery's family connection with
the Rothschilds (Lord Rosebery having
married Hannah de Rothschild, the eldesc
daughter and heiress, of Baron Meyer da
Rothschild) and their frequent outspoken
dissatisfaction with the financial and in
ternal policy of the present Cabinet
strengthens the supposition, and - the
statement of the peer above. quoted would
stand against any number of formal de
nials, .and means far more than any mere
schism in the Liberal party.
"I believe it is quite true that the
Rothschilds now own a half-interest in
the Times. We (the speaker is a member
of the Government) can no longer rely on
the Times' support, and can only deduce
that the Rothschilds intend to back lip
Lord Kosebery's- movement with all their
millions and the othen resources under
their control.". : \
It is now. announced that far more pow
erful influences than appear on the sur
face are at work in behalf of that curious
yet all important development which has
ensued upon Lord Rosebery's re-entrance
into public life. '
The. remarkable attitude of the London
Times continues to such an extent that
this Unionist organ deliberately takes up
the cudgel ih behalf of Lord Rosebery as
against the Duke of Devonshire, who
himself is only half-hearted in his opposi
tion to the former leader. Yet so imbued
are the. British press and public with the
notion that the Times could never oppose
a Conservative government that these
outspoken utterances pass almost â¢ with
out comment, and. such comment as ex
ists is confined to the "man in the street,"
who somewhat fearfully whispers, "Do
you think it possible that the Times is
going back on the Government?"
An explanation of this was afforded by
one of Lord Rosebery's fellow peers, who
is a personal friend of the fdrmer Pre
mier, though opposed to him in politics.
He said: - , ,
LONDON, March 1.â To successfully
diagnose the intentions and prospects of
the new Liberal movement under tho
auspices of Lord Rosebery was to solve a
puzzle which has every politician in Great
Britain by the ears. __

EXTRAORDINARY MERIT
Of a New Catarrh Cure.
Physicians are slow to take up new and un-
tried remedies, until their value has been es-
tablished by actual experiment, and they arw
naturally akepttcal of the â¢ many new pre-
parations constantly appearing; and for which
extravagant claim* are made. , >
The rrost llbÂ«ral and enlightened physlclani
are always ready, however, to make 'a fair
trial of any new specific and get at Its '.true
medical value.
A new prsoaratlon for the cure of catarrh
has attracted much attention -in the past few
months and has met with great- favor from thu
medical profession, not . only because It Js re-
markably successful ln <he cure of , catarrh,
but f.lso because It is not a. cecret patent med-
icine; any one using It knows just what he is
takl.is Into his system. \ *. !
. It iÂ« composed of blood Â¦ root which acts on
the blood and. mucoua membrane, hydrastln
for same purpose to . clear the mucus . from
head and throat, and red gum of eucalyptus
tree to destroy catarrhal germs in tlie blood.
All of these antiseptic .remedies . are , com-
bined In the form of a pleasant tasting 'tablet
or iczvTge, and are sold . by dru^grists under
n.inie Â»f 8 tu art's Qa*Arrli Tablet*, and many
recent 'tests ln chronic catarrh cases have eÂ«.
tablUhed Its merit beyond- question/

Additional honor
CONFERRED BY ADMIRAL DEWEY
AND REV. FATHER AUGUSTINE
McCLORY, SAN FRANCISCO.
It given me much pleasure to recommend to
the public Mr. Oeorse Mayerle of 1UT1 Market
street, tJs.n Franclscu, istrictly as a f kllliul and
expert optician. My sight began to fall ln 1877, ]
twenty-five years aro, and ulnce that time I .
have been wearing' glasses. I consulted a prom-
Inent optician ln Chicago, Dr. Holme*. At dif-
ferent times since that I have had lenses fitted
cm in Bt. Ixrols, Cleveland, O., and also tried
the Firth avenue opticians tn Plttsburg;, who
claim to be among the best ia their line ln the
country. I do not hesitate to say that I have
met with better and morÂ« satisfactory results
with Mr. Mayerle than with any of the above
named, who hare much higher pretensions. Re-
rpectfully,
FATHER AUGUSTINE McCLORY. O. F. M.

115 Golden Gate avenue, Ban Francisco.
ADMIRAL GEOKGÂ£ DEWEY,

ish-American war, and Is Mill using them with

It saved my husband's life. How thankful I
am te you for your remedy. Before I gave him
the Tobacco-Speclflc his heart was so bad that
he could not sleep of nights, and he was
troubled with his bowels most of the time. We
thought' his nerves were gone, but they were
not, for Tobacco-Speclflc brought them bock as
quiet aÂ» a child's. He sleeps now like a log,
and looks so well that every one speaks about
it." Mrs. Emma Wing. -
Men who have smoked and chewed tobacco
for years have marveled at this oasy way to
quit tobacco. Cigarette flends who have tried
without rewult all the drugs and anti-tobaccos
known have found their desire for tobacco In
any form entirely vanished In a few days with
this wonderful remedy so that tobacco Is pos-
itively distasteful to them.' Write Itogors Drug

can put It In any food or drink without any
danger of discovery, for it Is tasteless and
harmless, but It cures forever and at once all

him a message of love and congratulation
on hlH appointment to his- new position. Â¦
Dr. HemphHI feelingly expressed -â¢ his
deep gratitude* thai; his last message to
him was one of love. His dominant char

Indeed, great work toward the develop

believed that In the years to. come the
dead would be. given the highest praise.
Dr. Hemphill spoke feelingly to the be
reaved family und prayed that In. their
hour of trial they might be conBOled and
comforted In their knowledge of the high
osteem nnrt love In which the departed
whh held by his fellow citizens.

wns to, Btartlo. the world and bring Sey
mour Into. the !refulgent glarn.of cnvlablo
publicity was hot at hand: Suddenly Sei
fert conceived the. Idea of going to his
mother's .home at Â¦ Dnvlsvillc and- this
event was. twisted by, Seymour Into an at
tempt to escape. : Then followed the thrill
ing pursuit and capture as narrated.
. It. required only a few. minutes for. Sei
fert after , his; arrival. yesterday, to prove
his 'Innocence', of the suspicion cast upon
him by. the detectives.- It 'developed that
he was guilty of passing forged checks
nnd that^ he was not* unduly-desirous of
making the acquaintance of tire police if
it' tould; be avoided. â¢ He answered all
questions put to him with a frankness -not
to; bo .expected; from .a .guilty v man. He
even 'â¢ discussed- his. little â¢ escapades "with
women' and. the various projects Invented
by < him for-; raising money. , â¢ In â¢ fact ' there
was not the slightest excuse for his arrest
as : a* suspect In the Â¦ Fuller case ' and â¢ even
Seymour.- was- reluctantly :Â¦ compelled to
admit that fact later, in the. day. .- . Â¦
After a close examination, of the pris
oner and the failure of all who had seen
Bennett and Hawkins to recognise him*
as the man who had rented the house at
2211 Suiter street. Seymour began to shift
the blame up to the Morse ; detective
agency. He recognized that the faux pas
was of a character to bring the detective
department Into public ridicule and to ex
pose himself, as its head, to severe criti
cism. Like most' men of small caliber
who rise to positions of, power through
circumstances over which tthey have no
control rather than by, the force of indi
vidual merit, Seymour trembles jta'ti the
thought of criticism": and "-> cowers like a
craven when his offlclal"acts are subjected
to scrutiny. The conception of Seifert's
arrest did not even smack of originality
but ft was on a par with most of . the
brilliant achievements of Seymour, which
have made the detective force of thla city

was a suspicion that Seifert was thn as
sassin of poor Nota Fuller. He admitted,
however, that Seifert was charged with
obtaining money by false pretenses nnd
that he was merely arrested to answer
to that charge.
People who offered statements made by
other- parties, were" curtly -told, to bring
such persons to Seymour's office," and no
further effort was made lto< locate them'
or to secure their. testimony,: however im
portant It may. have been. In the arduous
taslcof reclining Jnhlsupholstered office
chair Seymour worked with commendable
diligence, < and .what he did not .know of

department ' thÂ« â¢ perpetrators of crlmo,
even though they display tho mark of
Cain upon. their brows, will remain unde
tected 1 and unpunished.
The investigation of .the foots In con
nection with the Â¦ murder of Norn Fuller
by Seymour has been marked from tho
commencement by a masterly Inactivity
nnd; a total disregard, ot tho inn a of In
duction and deduo.tloni.that would cause
a third-rate country, constablo-to blUBh to
bo guilty of. â¢.'Clews 'that wcro brought to
his attention were dissected' and . dis
missed by Seymour without leaving the
precincts of ,â¢â¢ his 'office Â¦' and. without? the
slightest outside inquiry. t
"On last Wednesday afternoon I- took
the afternoon train for Davisvllle. to
spend my, birthday with my r mother, Mrs.
.W. H. Hampton. I went down there ex
lRaiinBiABnffiBaBffl@siEisiaraH
. The departure of Seifert gave Seymour'
the opportunity he was looking for. â¢ He
sent Detective Hamill to Woodland, and
after an immense amount of searching in
quarters where Seifert was well .known'
the fugitive was "found concealed in a
vacant house" and brought to this city.
When Seymour was asked on what charge
Seifert was 'arrested he became . myste
riously secretive and denied that there
in company with Charles Conklin and twjT
women' 1 went to the .Winchester. We
were only there a. moment. I do not re
call -the women's names, as- they were
acquaintances of Â¦ only a few days. If
any young. girl. called at my room It was
during my absence and I did not know It.
The arrest of Seifert was of tke bur
lesque order and was accomplished with
the sole object of attracting .'public atten
tion to the "vigilance" of Seymour. The
warrant upon which he was arrested was
Issued In the latter part of January, and
could have been served at any time prior
to Wednesday, when Seifert went to Da
visville to visit his mother ; and to cele
brate his thirty-third birthday at her
home.
demonstrated beyond ques-'
tton that C. A. Seifert, who was ar
rested at Esparto on Friday, ostensibly
for embezzlement but actually for com
plicity in that crime, had absolutely, no
connection with that shocking event.
A || d HE colossal stupidity dls-
M played by Captain of Detcc-
Jf tlves Seymour in his manage-
Sj xnent of the Nora Fullor
ff murder case reached Its cll
"^ max yesterday when it was
Although Warrant for Druggist's Arrest Was Issued in January* No Attempt Was Made to Apprehend Him
Until an Opportunity Presented Itself to the Police for Making a Fine Theatrical Display. {
.In Selfert's possession at' the time of hfg
arrest were foupdÂ»C several i manuscripts.
.Some of them were in. his \hand writing,
but one- lecture was wrltterk in- a hand
that â¢ bore a striking resemblance to The
chlrqgraphlcal : fragments known to have
beerh written by Hhe man who rented the
Sutter street house." Seifert explained that
Seifert 'will prooably be released to-day.
He made arrangements, last night for the
settlement- of T.'.C. Lester's claim of $24
and'thls done he can'no longerbe held.
It develops, however, that several persons
,who\ hold forged checks Issued by him In
various small ?sums" have notified the
pollce'that they will -swear to warrants
for. his arrest to-morrow." In that event
Seifert will be arrested immediately upon
his release to. answer to other, charges of
embezzlement. "However that may be,
Seymour's bubble connecting Seifert with,
the murder of Â« Nora â¢ Fuller has_exploded
with a loud report.', the echoes of which
.will . not ' soon â¢ die . away. >â¢Â¦â¢ ,- , r
*nnd there ore many who assert that had
ho managed the Fuller murder case much
bettor results would have been achieved.
Tho.Â«o who have studied the workings ot
the detective department under Seymour
insist that ha has proved his incom
'petency -beyond all question and that
wlttmnn should In Justice to the Police
Department nnd for the preservation of
tts credit assume the. active direction of
Its affairs. When Captain Lees was ap
pointed Chief of Police to succeed Crowlcy
he did not relinquish his supervision of
the detective deoartment and it was well
for Â»the city that he did not. What Cap
tain* Lees did - then Captain Wittman
should do now, and until he does so the
detective department of the police bureau
In San Francisco, irresponsibly managed
as It Is by Seymour, will continue- to be
mere child's play and ultimately develop
Into a farcical adjunct of the municipal
ity.'
INNOCENCE OF SUSPECTED ASSASSIN AND UTTER
INCOMPETENCE OF CHIEF OF DETECTIVES SHOWN
Contradictions Are Ignored.
[ The lack of resemblance In appearance
and handwriting between Seifert and tho
man Hawkins, the known habits of tho
suspect and his lack of money were flat
contradictions that he could have any
connection with the crime. These fact*
were known to Seymour several days be
fore the arrest was made, but he was
anxfous to do something to pacify the
| public Indignation arising from his help
lessness In the face of such a crime, and
he countenanced a fiasco.
"I have never placed much faith in the
belief." said Seymour, "that Seifert wu
the murderer., but there were some cir
cumstances that tended, to show he might
know something of the crime. -These cir
cumstances have been 'explained satis
factorily, as far as I am concerned, and
Seifert can go as soon as he has satisfied
the complaints against him regarding his
financial .transactions.. It has been our
policy to follory.out to the end every, clew
in this case that* has < come to our atten
tion, and the arresr.of Seifert. waa along
this line. The information on which "we
worked. was furnished us partly by out
side . parties. â¢ The reason the arrest Â¦ was
not made In San Francisco < was because
we could not 'find Seifert.' If he was In
the city openly before he went to Davis
vllle, and was generally known to be
here, it is mighty strange that/he was
not : found ~ by the police, Â¦ who have 'Â¦ been
looking for him for over a week."
' The Chief did not say that the' detective
department, with the purpose of magni
fying, its efforts, had told him that Set
fert was In every particular a counterpart
of the man described as Bennett by F.
"W. Krone, even to the drooping eyelid.
He did not say that the detective depart
ment claimed that Selfert's handwriting
was exactly similar to that of Hawkins.
He did not care to reflect upon the detect-'
tive branch of the service, but the fact it
that Seymour deceived tho Chief as well
as the public when he made, his grand
stand play by having' a man arrested In
the country whom he should have had In
custody a month before, and whoso
whereabouts in tho city up to last
Wednesday could have been â¢ ascertained.
by anybody except, perhaps, . & Sun
Francisco detective.
Captain Seymour came to consciousness
lone enough yesterday to announce that
ho had concluded that Seifcrt did not kill
Nora Fuller. It was a conclusion that
was apparent from the first to any one
with ordinary common sense, but the Sey
mour brain moves slowly. In such matters.
He spent the morning in trying to distort
the circumstances surrounding the pris
oner's career into some shape where he
could tlnd a shadow of an excuse for thu
theatrical manner In which Seifert was
captured -on the suspicion that he knew
something of the Fuller murderer, but
was. compelled to acknowledge his mis
take. .Â¦ .. fl&MMiMMBi
Chief Wittxnan Not Satisfied.
"I had been led to believe that in Seifert
we would find a man who might give valu
able information of the manner In which
Nora Fuller met her death. Ho dressed
much in the same fashion that Bennett is
represented to have assumed. Ho fre
quented the first-class restaurants in
company with women and the detective*
say he occasionally went to the Popular.
He was known to have been acquainted
with Emma Searight, and It was Interred
that through her he had made the ac

McFaddcn bout' was not warranted, ac
cording'to the opinion of nomo experts
on boxing. McFadden forced the fighting
throughout and was entitled to'credlt for
his work. Welch was glad to have it no
worse than a . draw and nobody was In
jured. There was comparatively littlo
betting on the fight, certainly not enough
to warrant the tumult which developed.
His attitude was strained and he seemed
to lose his head. With a stiff puncher In

different ending to the light.

Britt is considered a good drawing card
by the club managers and efforts are al
ready being made to sign' him for another
match.. The consensus of, opinion among
men who saw the fight was that he must
get some practice with boxers who are
not in the tlrst flight. He has much to

CB. MOBTON TELLS HOW
HE EARNED A TIDY FEE
Belfert wo* confronted by P. W, Krone
of the Popular restaurant, Ed Btenjj*!, a.
"Seifert telephoned me one evening, say
ing he had a couple of girls and wanted
me. to take dinne/ with them. I was
anxious to see him, so as to close up the
business about his lease, and I accepted.
I do not remember the women's names,
nor even their appearance. We went to
an Italian restaurant on Broadway and
1 paid the bill, Then we walked up
Kearny street, and Seifert proposed to
go to . the Winchester House to get his
coat. I do not remember whether 'we
went up to his room or not,- He and the
women took a Mission-street car in front
of the -Winchester, and I left them there
und went home,"
Charles Conklin, the ticket broker, who
visited Seifert's room in company with
two women, recalled the incident last
night. V
"The only trouble with me," said Sei
fert, "Is that I am too good a fellow. I
like to spend money with my friends, and
sometimes get into trouble because my
cash runs short." â¢
Good Fellowship His Fault.
Regarding the numerous checks whiih
Seifert has issued on the Western Na
tional. Bank, and which have been re
turned because there were no funds to
meet them, Seifert says that he merely
overdrew his account at the bank and
would make good all the amounts the
checks called for. He admitted that two
years ago last June he had been arrested
for passing a worthless check on the Co
lumbia Bank, and said that It was an
other case of overdraft which had been
fixed up without difficulty. He has a way
of dismissing such matters as issuing
checks without any bank account as mere
trifles that may be adjusted any time.
A wicker telescope valise belonging to
Seifert was secured at Woodland by De
tective HamlU containing some linen,
towels, underwear and' a spatula, the lat
ter being stained with what looked like
blood. Seifert said the 'valise had re
mained in a livery stable in Woodland
since December 8. He could not say what
the substance on the spatula was, but
thought he had last used the instrument
in mixing a plaster. .
'-Seifert is a graduate of the University
of Calif ornia\pf the class of. 1887. He was
33 years old Mast Thursday. After his
graduation he remained at the univer
sity, acting for two years as instructor
in materia medica and occupying the po
sition of professor of pharmacy for five
years. In 1897 he was appointed a member
of the State Board of Pharmacy. Two
years ago he was accused of selling ex
amination questions In advance to appli
cants for a license. The matter was
given some publicity at the time, but was
hushed up.. Seifert says he was entirely
innocent in this affair. On this ac
count, - he , says, his wife and he
had a difference. He was married to a
widow in Oakland in 1891, but they have
not been living together, he says, for two
or three years. He professes not to know
his wife's whereabouts at present, but
thinks she is living at the Hotel del
Monte, In Monterey. .
Seifert's Effects Examined.
this was a lecture delivered before the
graduating class of the University of Cal
tfornla in 1S91 by the Rev. J. B. Silcox,
at that time a Congregational minister of
Oakland. He had not seen Silcox for
seven or eight years, and the last ho
heard of him he was in Chicago.
"1 did not see him again until January
13, when Jie paid me $30. A. the same time
he talked of taking a cigar privilege for
$90, but this matter was never concluded.
In the meanwhile he rented space in the
office of .Ticket Broker Conklin at 710
Market street without, however, making
any payment of rent to that gentleman.
He agreed to do certain advertising for
the carnival and made arrangements with
Morton L. Cook to advertise in the Oak
land streetcars.- He was to pay: Cook $82
and retain as his commission the . re
mainder of $125, which was given him in
the shape of $1 carnival tickets. What he
did with the money we have not yet found
out, but we got no benefit out "of the
transaction. We learned afterward that
he contracted with Cook for space on the
Grand . Opera-house curtain and he gave
Cook a check on r the l Western National
Bank for $22 50, which proved to be worth
less. Â¦ Â¦ s '-'â¢>"Â¦ 'â¢ '"Â¦ ' ' Â¦Â¦â¢ ' . S
"Every contract made by. him. for ad
vertising in the carnival programme, with
one or two exceptions, proved to be
crooked. , He made all sorts of agreements
to secure ' contracts â¢ and when: we sought
to collect on them we discovered that he
had promised to take out a portion of the
bills In trade. In one case he agreed to
take out, a bill of J10 in dancing lessons
and in another; he was to take it out' in
Turkish baths. We : paid " him commis
sions on business. which we could not'col
lect and altogether he proved to be an ex
pensive-acquaintance to. our 'concern.". â¢! -

"I first met Seifert in the latter part of
December, when he came to my office to
secure space for a display at the, carnival.
He said he .wanted to make a display of
perfumery and after I heard his proposi^
tion I told him he could have the space
for $60. One-half of this sum was to be
deposited at the time of the signing of the

There will be an extra concert to-night,
in consequence of a demand for a 'popular
programme, and the following interesting
programme will be given: Overture,
"Freiuchutz"; .'cello solo, fantasie on
"Fllle du Regiment"; Tschalkowsky
"1812" overture (by request); Bruch con
certo for violin; duet from "Romeo et
Juliette"; Dvorak's "New World Sym
phony"; Liszt's "Les -Preludes," and
Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."
The third concert of the Chicago Sym
phony Orchestra drew a flatteringly large
house at the Metropolitan Temple yester
day afternoon, in spite of the inclement
weather. The programme was a com
bination Beethoven and Wagner menu,'
and Included compositions that are not
commonly to be heard. Chief in interest
was the seventh symphony of Beethoven
and the Chicago Orchestra showed here
Its most characteristic achievement.
Truly to be admired is the perfect rhyth
mic accord of their work, the easy
curacy and . precision. . The band is full
of good material, the tone quality and bal
ance are excellent, and its only lack is a
temperamental one. The "Lenore" over
ture â¢ touched a more spontaneous and
fresh note than was reached elsewhere in
the programme, and was received by the
audience with large enthusiasm. Mr. Van
Ordt was responsible for the third Bee
thoven number, the first movement of the
D major concerto, and again pleased by
his easy facility of handling and refined
style. The Wagner numbers were the
Vorspiel, from "Lohengrin," and "Preis
lled," from "Die Meistersinger," i Mr.
Towne; "Waldweben," from "Siegfried,"
and aria, "Elizabeth's Prayer, 1 ' from
"Tannhauser,". Mme.. Linne,,and-"Huldl
gung's Marsch." . Â«Â¦"Â¦< Â» Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â» â â¢ > igÂ» ~f** r
Mr. Towne has fully established him
self here as a tenor of considerable natu
ral endowment, Â« with a technique that
commands respect and a way of handling
his numbers that invariably pleases.
Mme. Linne sings in a graceful and sym
pathetic style that is hardly sufficiently
dramatic for the Wagnerlan numbers.
The band again distinguished itself In the
Wagnerian numbers.

Charge of Assault to murder Against
Dixon and Fraser Is Dis
missed. - . '
Charles Dixon and John D. Fraser, the
two men charged with assault to murder
on complaint of James Behrn, foreman
for Contractor Sibley, appeared before
Judge Cabanlsa yesterday and the cases'
were dismissed.
i Detective Fitzgerald, who worked on
j the case, said that he had made a thor
ough investigation and was satisfied that
Behrn was romancing. Sergeant Ayers
and two patrolmen were within a block
and a half of the Fifteenth and Folsom 1
streets corner where Behrn alleged a shot
was fired at him at the time of the shoot
ing, and they did not hear any report,
nor did ony one In the neighborhood.
Both defendants were hard-working men
employed by Contractor Kelso, and had
never been in trouble before.
I The Judge said there was only the evi
' dence of the complaining witness to sus
i tain the charge, which was emphatically
I denied by the defendants, and considering
the statements made by Detective Fitz
gerald he had no hesitation in dismissing
the case^^
! Behrn alleged that the two defendants
followed him from the Union Hotel on
I Folsom street, near Sixteenth, early
Tuesday morning, and when he reached
Fifteenth street on his way home one of
them knocked him down with a sandbag.
He struggled with him and got away
from him. "When he started to run away
the other defendant fired a shot at him,
he said.

The Civil Service Commission will meet
Monday to take action on the suspended
deputies' petition. â¢ Tax Collector Smith
takes the stand' that the charter jtfvos
him the power without any restriction to
sv&pend for a period of thirty days, and
the Civil ' Service Commission is inclined
to take that view of the case. However,
It is certain that the opinion of the City
Attorney will be requested as to the
meaning of the section on thirty, day
suspensions. - Â¦ ; : : â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢
Tax Collector Smith agrees to abide by
that opinion and restore the suspended
deputies to their positions if the City At
torney holds that the appointing power
is subject to the rules of the Commission
in this particular case: Smith denies that
there is anything political in the suspen
sions, or that he proposes to suspend the
deputies .every alternate month so as to
disgust them with their positions. Smith
says such a course would be unreason
able, as he .would have to take civil.ser
vice eligibles in any event, and if a man
does his duty he is certain of his place.
Tax Deputies Salomon, Tripp, Rittlg
stein,'ZIon and Tuttle, who were ; sus
pended for thirty days ,by Tax Collector
Smith owing to lack of work in the office,
appealed yesterday to; the Civil Service
Commission to restore them to their posi
tions. The deputies represent that dis
crimination was used in their suspen
sion, and that the rule of the Commis
sion that those eligible standing lowest on
the list shall be the first to go. was vio
lated. The deputies further aver that
their positions are statutory, and that if
any employes were to be discharged for
lack of work they should come from the
extra clerks employed in the office.

I Varlcocele Is an enlargement of the most vital blood vessels in man. The H
j functions of these veins are to carry off waste, thus enabling the organ to receive J3
â¢ fresh nutrition. The disease consists of dilatation and local stagnation of blood, i
, As a result we find sometimes quite insensitive organs, which are ill-fitted to pro- !
â¢ duce their secretion. Varieocele is a very common disorder. Statistics show that 25 **
I per cent of the male population is afflicted wtth some stage of the disease. We B

We have done a wonderful business i
this week, but not up to our expecta- |
tions. Our prediction did not come !
true, for last Monday we advertised that !
the remaining 106 pianos of the whole-
sale stock of the Eilers Piano
Co. must and would be sold
before Friday night. But we fell
down â in fact, reckoned without
our host, for we sold but 05 of them.
That's a good many, we know, but
not as many as we wanted to.' During
the week we had two fierce storms,
(and they were corkers, too.) .and
so much bad weather in the bargain
that, many were unable to get out. Had
good weather kept up the old stock
would have all been sold lonjj befort
the end of the week. Here is what we
have left of the old stock:
One $275 Piano â sell for .$150.
Four $325 Pianosâ sell for 91S3.
Three $400 Pianos â sell for S?2O7.
Two $425 Pianosâ sell for $218.
>On e $450 Pianoâ sell for #250.
They nre all in fine shape, brand-
new and fully warrantedâ and the above
prices are just like Riving them away.
\Ve arc going to sell them. sure, and
any reasonable offer as to terms will be
accepted. Come quick, for they won't
last long at this if TO-MORROW we
are favored with better weather than
the past week has been â and by Tues-
day night (even with storms) they will
all be gone.
We have a second-hand square piano
â came in late Saturday and has not as
yet been put in rendition. If vou come
crrly to-rncrro.v morning you will Â«ec !

it in fine condition for $62.50â $5.00

Some Sensible Advice to Women by
v Mrs. E. Sailer,;
President German Relief Association, Los Angeles, CaL
Owiisg"to modern methods of living 1 , not one woman 'in. a thousand ap-
proaches this perfectly natural change without experiencing a train of very
annoying and sometimes painful symptoms. . â¢ â¢
Those dreadful hot flashes, sending the blood surging to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, sometimes with chills,
as if the heart were going to stop for good, are only a few of the symptoms of
a dangerous nervous trouble. The nerves are crying out for'assistance. The
cry should be heeded in time. Lydia E. Plnkham's Vegetable Com-
pound was p* epared to meet the needs of woman's system at this trying
period of her life, and all women who use it pass through this trying period'
with comfort and safety.
MRS. E. SAILER;
"Deab 3lns. Pinkham: â When I passed through what is known
as * change of life,' I had. two years', suffering, â sudden heat, and as
quick chills would pass orer me ; my appetite was variable and I never
could tell for a day at a time how I would feel the next day. Five
bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound changed all
that, my days became days of health, and I have enjoyed every day
since, â now six years. . . '
" We have used cpnsiderable of your Vegetable Compound in our
charitable work, as we find that to restore a poor mother to health.* so
she can support herself and those dependent upon her, if such there be,
is truer charity than to give other aid. You have my hearty endorse-
ment, for you have proven yourself a true friend to suffering women."
â Mes. E. Sailer, 736* Hill St., Los Angeles,- Cal.
When one &tops to think about the good Mrs. Sailer derived from Mrs.
Pinkham's advice and medicine, it seems almost beyond belief yet it is all
true as stated in her letter published above at her own request.
Xo other medicine in the world has received such widespread
and unqualified endorsement. Refuse all substitutes.
As a matter of positive fact Mrs. Pinkham has on file thousands of. letters
from women who have been safely carried through that danger period
"Change of Life." Mrs. Sailer's cure is not an unusual one for Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine to accomplish.
No other person can give, such helping advice to women who
are sick as can Mrs. Pinkham, for none have had such a great
experience â her address is Lynn, Mass., and her advice free^ â If
j you arc sick write her^ â you are foolish if you don't.

RAND CHANCELLOR CAL
"/ \/C KINS, who has since his elec
/( r^>v\ tlon at Stockton last May. offl
lV' 1 J/ dally visited the greater por
\^y tlon of the California lodges,
reports marked activity
; anuHig the Knights of Pythias
In almost every district. Eight new
lodges have been organized so far during
his administration and several more are
in process of formation. With very few
exceptions, the established lodges -are
growing at a good rate. The Increase
Is of a desirable and lasting character, as
well as the" greatest attained In the do
main during any . corresponding period
within recent years. ,
Advices received at headquarters from
all parts of the country: give assurance
that the International gathering of the
order to be held In San Francisco next |
August will be the largest yet recorded,
and thaj the number of visitors will be
the greatest that has ever come to
the State. Every State and Ter
ritory will send large delegations of mem- |
bers, and the Canadian provinces will be
well represented. Even Mexico and the i
Hawaiian Islands will send delegations.
The unusually low rates of railroad fare
to the State from all points, and the fact
that these rates are available also to non
members, Is leading tho western railroads
to prepare for the heaviest passenger
traffic in their history.
Friendship Lodge of Healdsburg has in
creased to 170 - members and expects to
reach the 800 mark by July.
West Oakland Lodge has recently sain
ed fourteen memben and la receiving apÂ«
plications at every convention.

"Shingle mills are not rushed eo much now,

The redwood shingle is becoming a great fas
ter throughout the entire length and breadth
of America and orders are coming in for ex
port shipments. - Reports from the' Pacific
ICorthweet would tend to show that lumber
men are making experiments with Oregon pine
for the purpose of seeing what can be <5one
with It in the eh ingle line. Taken as a whole,
the lumber trade is In a far better condition
to-day than for i*any years past, and manu
facturers, Jobbers and retailers have no cause

cient stocks are difficult to secure."
"Sugar and Cahtomla white with yellow

'â¢In the Oregon pine zone and that of the
Tactile Northwest eenerally. together with the
tpruce and fir circles, a great Impetus Is no
ticesble. and the manufacturers anticipate a
record-breaking year. The mills are crowded
â¢with orders lor luture delivery, both from for

There has been a good demand Â¦ for bonds,
mostly for some of the speculative issues.
United States 3s registered were % and do
coupon, and the n*w 4s were % per cent over
the closing call of last week. . - Â¦â¢
The period of crop uncertainty is also at
hand. On Wednesday of this week .reports
of damage to the winter wheat crop . were
made an effective Instrument in the hands of
the bears in the stock market. They expressed
apprehension, likewise, that labor troubles may
develop durlns the spring, especially In the
coal fields. Wall street awaits some" further
light on these questions.
Much weight has been attached by specula
tors to the expected development of plans for
further consolidations, as they may be af
fected by the Northern Securities Company's
fate. The proposed suit against this company
by the Government necessarily brings into
question not only its own future, but that of
many other projects designed on the same
lines. The ssttlement of the Government's
suit is recognized to be a matter of months
and perhaps years, and no one supposes that
the stock market will lie stagnant all that
time. There are. factors, Of more. immediate
application which promise uncertainty in the
speculative sentiment. The money outlook Is
by no means clear and the resumption of gold
exports on a large scale -Is a complicating
factor. It is clear that the gold has gone out
in payment of maturing of obligations abroad,
and the growing demands on the foreign cred
its Indicates that further calls will- be made
by this country's foreign creditors. The specu
lation in Kaffirs In London has apparently
culminated for the time, and the taking up of
contracts in these has required resort for
loans to the Bank of England on an enormous
scale. The weekly statement of the Bank of
France reflects the same tendency there. , The
supply of exchange bills In our market Is very
Ecanty. owing to the small outward movement
of frraln and cotton, and the alternative for
American debtors Is to ship gold. A consider
able outward movenÂ»nt Is expected during the
cominK month. The interior is already show
ing Â¦ evidence of spring requirements for cur
rency. With New York surplus reserves of
modest dimensions, such a simultaneous de
mand from both directions is likely to result In
straichtened circumstantes for those depend
ent upon call loans, as the majority of specu
lators are. â¢ Â¦
The distinctive feature of the dealings In
the stock market this week has been the prom
inence of the lees important stocks which are
not Immediately allied with the great rail
way systems and the Industrials of amall cap
italization and which aro affected only by In
dividual causes and are not a barometer of
general conditions. Interest has shifted from
one to another of these during the week.
Usually some ostensible reason was advanced
for the buying of the particular stocks af
fected, but they were for. the most part vague
rumors and there were often sudden relapses
In prices when rumors failed of confirmation
and the speculative pools responsible for . the
movements bad taken their prints. The sum
of these movements helped out the appearance
of activity- in the market for much of the time,
.but they were in Â¦ reality a 1 symptom of the
underlying neglect and Indifference of capital
'to the market. As for. the general market as
a whole it has maintained a fairly firm under
tone, notwithstanding the tendency toward
stagnation. That . is to say. holders are not
seeking to market stocks while. the demand la
so Blight that the sales/ could be effected only
at concessions in prieef This agrees with the
widely held theory that a very large- volume
of securities, representing the proceeds of con
solidations, is In Etrons hands and that thi
complete success of the i consolidations cannot
be said to be assured until the securities find
ownership .with the investing public. .
NEW YORK, March l.â The | stock market
was very listless and Idle to-day and reflected
declining Interest even on the part of the pro
fessional traders. Many of these have taken
advantage of. the dull business on* the Ex
change to no away for spring vacation trips,
and the ab*encÂ« from the "street .of many of
the bankers -and railroad proprietors wbo are
usually concerned in large doings vhowithe
general acquiescence Jn tho I present state of

mnko up the market devoted their attention to

pied them for some time past. With the e %Â¦
o-Mlon of a rise of '2fi In Amerlcun Cotton
Oil, said to be due to favorable trade condi
tions, there was no movement of sufficient Im
portance to chronicle. The room shorts cov

â¢ CHICAGO, March 1.â The early, flurry in
oats yas the outcome of a rumor that a heavy
holder of May oats was ordering No. 2 mixed
oats out of â¢ regular elevators Â«f or the purpose
of shipping as much I as possible | of contract
stock out of Chicago. , Shorts regarded this as
a challenge and for the first hour there was a
lively scramble to cover. There was some
prospect that an attempt was being | made to
force values before the Government crop re
port.' which is expected March 10. Receipts
continue slow, and there are no Indications to
point to an early increased movement. Storms
are breaking up the roads. ' These Influences
aided in the manipulation, which did not come
entirely unexpected. I Nervousness . prevailed
all morning and tho trade was heavy. May
opened V4@ Via up at 44%@45c, eased momen
tarily to ,44%44%c~and then . went upward
with quick jumps to 46%c. One buyer got
nearly 1,000,000 bushels at i the high* figure.
Later the market quieted down and on absence
of demand prices slid back as quickly as they
advanced. May touched 44%c and closed still
firmer, %Â®>/4c higher at 44%@43c. Â¦
Wheat was active at tfmes, but with a de
clining tendency that 'was checked , by the
strength early In the coarse grain market*.
The range was small and trade not heavy, and
all told there was Â¦ little of importance. The
damage reports continued to come In from the
Southwest, but tho crowd was slow to believe
them, and on the heavy rains the 1 feeling: was
Inclined to be bearish. May. opened a shade
higher to a shade lower at 77c to 7QTaC, held
steady near those prices the first hour or so,
and then, when corn broke, eased. off to 76%c,
May closed easy, %o lower at 70%@76%c.
' Corn was active and somewhat nervous. -The
Â«nrly market was Inclined to ba bearish, but
iho up-turn In oatÂ» caused a firmer teellnjr.
May closftd h^avy and weak, %Â©%c lower at
01 %c. The late market was very weak, owing
to heavy short selling and uncovering of stop
liiuM orders. â¢ ,ILX' L> *â¢ Â¦ _.
Provisions opened with a better tone. The
light receipts and htgher.prlc.es at the yard*
wer<Â« factors. On the bulge packers offered
freely and on the grain slump prices eased
yenterday. Maypork closed- 2%o lower, lard
unchanged and ribs 6$7Vic lower.
