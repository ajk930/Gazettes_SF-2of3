the identity, of . the woman who ' was the

After . reading the account | of Â¦ the caucus in a

very serious character. .
â¢,'Pordney of Michigan opposed the bill.' .He
declared that not a single Cuban ' appeared be

he : said, , was - either, an ; American citizen ' own
ing sugar land in Cuba or Indirectly 'or dlrect

"Absoiutely : nothlnsr," r replied Richardson.
, ' Richardson called attention . to the action of
two country - districts of 'Babcock, indorsing;
the- latter' s bill "to remove, the duties on steel,
and amid Democratic applause said the Demo
crats proposed to give Babcock, an opportunity
later on to vote for the bill; his constituents
had Indorsed. He' also outlined the Demo
cratic programme relative to - offering an
amendment to abolish the - differential duty on
refined sugar. If this amendment carried, he
said,' five or six million dollars would be taken
from' the sugar refiners and given to the Amer

Â¦ "Does . the gentleman from Tennessee know
anything of a - reported bargain between the
leaders on this side and the Democrats on that
by. which the Crumpacker resolution: is to be
smothered in 'order to aid the passase of the

. Richardson of .- Tennessee, ' .the Democratic
le'ader, was the first speaker. He mads a care
ful .' and dispassionate speech, ' explaining why
he had voted ' in . favor . of ; reporting Â¦ the bill.
He | stated frankly that - he ' doubted .whether
the enactment of the bill would Â¦ do . much to

for it in the hope that 'It might accomplish

These high rates could not stand and. he said,'

Dr. S. J. Gardner testified he was at
the Railroad Hospital when Robinson was
taken there and told of a short conversa
tion he had with the dying man. Robin
son told him that there were four men
implicated in the shooting, and said they
had shot him down like a dog. "He s sald
be was chasing them," continued the wit
ness, "but was unable to tell much about
the affair. We tried to get a dying state
ment from him, but without success." Â¦ â¢
ROBINSON WAS CONSCIOUS.
George Eastman, a plumber, â¢ testified
that the first shot awakened Jiim from
Bleep, and then he Â¦ heard several more
shots. "I went to the front of my house,"
he said, "and I saw a man lying In the
street. My attention was called . to Offi
cer Ingram, who was calling from his
window. I thought it was a drunken
brawl. Officer Robinson was not in uni
form and was lying In the gutter.; When
I reached him he was groaning. I opened
my place of business opposite and Rob
inson was carried in. Robinson seemingly
recognized me, as he answered my ques
tions. I did not, ask him who shot him."
Vincent M. Vogden, a cook, testified in
part as follows: "I was closing my res
taurant 7 at C17 Valencia ' street when I
beard a shot fired. I did not pay any at
tention to It, as I thought a drunken row
was in progress. . When I heard six more
shots I stepped to the door and saw three
men run away., .They passed me on the
run. One of ..them had a pistol . In his
hand. I then went over to where a man
was lying in the gutterway. I recognized
him as Officer Robinson."
The first witnesss called was Dr. J. F.
Sullivan, who testified that he was called
to attend Robinson when he was taken
Into Eastman's plumbing shop on Valen
cia street immediately after the shooting.
He said that he found Robinson in a dy
ing condition and administered stimulants.
Robinson was soon afterward taken to
the Railroad Hospital, where he died four
hours later.

The meeting passed a resolution to con

this we, while preserving our 'ideal, will

Great excitement followed the vote In

Ing in the Malson du Peuple, at which M.
Van Dervelde, the leader of the Socialist
movement In Belgium, urged his hearers

took a conciliatory j form. . : He j indicated
the dangers attending, the insurrection of
an almost weaponless people against or
ganized forces of police arid military, and
said- a struggle" by methods of violence
was quite hopeless. The people could only;

he trusted the King would 'arbitrate! in

A similar riot occurredin another part

The rioting at Louvain. began at about
7:30 o'clock to-night. A band of Socialists

sey, Samar, and his fellow plotters were
shot, as he believed, by the orders of Ma
jor. Glenn." The trial was adjourned until
April 22.'
ATKINSON IS SUMMONED.
The reports state, however, that Maca
bebe scouts treat their own people as
harshly as they do the Tagalogs. In re
gard to the application of ' the "water-'
cure" treatment to women, and other
outrages committed upon them*, the de
partment states that every case was im
mediately investigated and the perpetra
tors were punished. The department is
considerably concerned over the publica
tion of reports of atrocities and Is minim
izing their, importance, j Members of the
Senate committee say," however, that the
charges are extremely, serious and that
the Democrats are making as much cap
ital as possible out of them, for use in the
fall elections.
In anticipation of a call from the Senate
Committee on Philippines,' the .War De
partment prepared to-day copies of re
ports detailing outrages committed by
Macabebe scouts. These reports, will, it is
said at the department, show that swift
punishment has ' followed all . cruelties
committed by the natives. This will
show, furthermore, that there has beta
enmity for many years between the Mao
ababes and Tagalogs, arising out of an
attack by the latter upon the former.

The President has high admiration tot
Root. He constituted him his chief ad

after he took the oath of office In Buffalo

than any other member of .the Cabinet.
The President would regard it as a mis

advantage of the party If he got out vol

Tawney argued that if the beet sugar in
dustry were properly protected Jn a few years
it would supply the entire domestic consume
Tawney at the outsot defended the course of
those on the Republican side who had not stir
rendered their convictions that "thrift might
follow fawning." He pointed to illustrious in
stances in the past where Republicans had op
posed measures advocated by a. majority of
their colleagues^ â notably the case of ex
gpeaker Reed in the Congress when he voted
to Issue gold interest bearing bonds. He de
clared that those of his colleagues who be
lieved as he did had been denounced ae traitors,
their motives had been impugned and they had
even been insulted because tftey had dared to
assert and defend what they believed to be
the interest of their >party, their constituents
and their country.
The remaining time after Hepburn concluded
â two hours and twenty minutes â was divided
equally between Tawney (Minnesota), who
closed the debate against the bill, and Dalzell
of Pennsylvania, ' who concluded for the
masure. : " /-
Would Protect Beet Sugar.
Hepburn also satirized the two and a. half
hour speech of Long cf Kansas, which he de
scribed as a "great physical effort." which
befitted the Kansas statesman for a champion
ship in the prize ring under the Marquis of
Queensberry rules. He denounced the feature
of the bili to compel Cuba to accept our Im
migration laws when the greatest need of
Cuba to-day was labor. If the. Yankee was
Â¦what he -was sometimes said to beâ cunning,
grasping, avaricious and adroit â then he would
say this section of the bill had been written by
a Yankee.
"Great God!" exclaimed Hepburn. "On what
a slender thread hang everlasting things."
(Great laughter and applause.)
It was only when the concession was reduced
5 per cent further that he was induced to sup
port it. In other words, said Hepburn, had it
not been for that last nickel of reduction, the
gentleman Irom Ohio, to quote his own lan
guage, would have to-day been with the in
surgents attempting to divide the Republican
party and destroy It.
With great earnestness Hepburn continued
to express his doubt whether such alleged
methods would be resorted to to pass a bill
which he was convinced 80 per cent of the
Republicans were indifferent .or opposed to.
He held up to ridicule some of the most ardent
friends of the measure. He quoted from the
speech of Groevenor of Ohio the statement that
Grosvenor declined to support a bill for a 50,
*0, SO or 25 per cent reduction. " -. ' .

"I do not believe it. I think the gentleman

It his duty to this House to be more explicit

Just before he concluded,- Dalzell discussed
the Question of striking the differential from

Senators, including Elkins of West Virginia.
Spooner of Wisconsin and Fairbanks -of In

cock of New. York alBo was on the floor. The
galleries had also filled to overflowing and al
most every member was in his seat, so that he
had a brilliant and attentive audience. Re

auspices. ~ â¢ '
It Is not a revision of the existing: tariff

As in duty bound, I send this dispatch to
your Excellency, requesting you to transmit it
to your Government and ask them to adopt*
s-crne plan to withdraw me Philippines from
the operations of this harsh regulation,- so as
to pacify the Chinese emigrants, which will be
amicable and just.
The communcation is signed' by Prince
Ching, President of the Chinese Board of
Foreign Affairs. .
In the House to-day the Senate amend
ments to the Chinese exclusion bill were
disagreed to and the bill was sent to con
ference. Hltt, Perkins and Clark were ap
pointed conferees. â¢
If no distinction is to be made between la
borers and merchants and the severe regula
tions are to 'be applied to that place also and
are to be subjected to these harsh "restrictions,
I fear the good reputation of your honorable
country "will hardly be able to escape injury.
Tour honorable country has usually the repu
tation of being lenient, and at present your re
lations with China are especially friendly.
There are places to which the restriction*
agreed upon in past treaties apply, but while
we are hoping that these restrictions may be
entirely abrogated, there- has never been any
treaty applying the restrictions to those
islands.
I find en examination Vhat the- Philippines
are not far from China and that from the time
of the Mills' dynaety, which preceded the pres
ent, down to to-day a large number of-emi
grants have gone there from Fuklen and the
two Kuangs, amounting to a hundred thou
sand, more or less, and that it is very difficult
to put a etop to the coming and going of their
families, fellow villagers and relatives. These
Â« migrants were formerly ! ill treated and
harassed by the Spanish Government, but
they were never forbidden to land or harshly
driven back to China.
On the ninth of the first moon of the
XXVIII year Kuang^Hsu (February 18, 1902),
I received a petition from Verraln Chinese mer
chants in the Philippines saying that the
United States officials are obstructing the en
trance of Chinese; that they have established
exclusion officers at the ports, Â¦ and that when
Chinese . arrive in the -Â¦' waters, . no matter
whether they are laborers or merchants, all are
driven in together and treated as criminals,
and if there is any mistake made by them in
their verbal statements they are not al
lowed to land, but are compelled to return to
China.
WASHINGTON. April 18.â The Secre
tary of State to-oay transmitted to the

: WASHINGTON. April J8.-The Colom
bian, canal protocol, which was delivered
at the State Department on April -1, ana
afterward recalled by Minister Concha for
modifications, was again presented to Sec-y
rC ThT proposal as' to price is set out as
follows: One year after the .exchange of
ratifications of a treaty the United States
shall pay Colombia the lump sum of $7,
000 000. This figure will represent fourteen
years' rental at $500,000 a year. At the
end of the fourteen>ears period the price
which the United States shall pay each
year is to be fixed by mutual consent of
the two" countries. In case^ the Paries
cannot agree upon a sum it will be left to
an arbitrator to be selected between: the
two Governments. - Â£ilwi
The protocol provides for the appoint
ment of a joint committee representing
Colombia ,and the United States which,
will arrange and provide for all matters
pertaining to- the administration of affairs
within the proposed canal belt, including:
the membership of the mixed - tri
bunals for the administration or
Justice, and other steps necessary to the
joint occupation of the belt. It is realized
that the building of a Panama .canal
would bring great numbers of persons or
all sorts and conditions to the isthmus,
and for this reason it has been provided
that the policing of the strip shall be per
formed by both American and Colombian
constables, neither of these nationalities,
it is held, being efficient without the aid
of the other. ;->.; . " . Â¦
It is stated positively In an authorita
tive quarter that the .modifications for
which the protocol was recalled were in
no sense a retraction of any of the pro
posals embodied in it at its former pre
sentation, but were in the nature of ex
planations which make certain points
clearer, but do not chansre their effect.
The retention of Colombian sovereignty
over the canal land Is a point which has
been consistently adhered to all through,
the protocol, and none of its provisions
relinquish this sovereignty in any degree.
It is stated. . . "-'â¢

DAWSON. Y. T., April 18.â The follow
ing telegram was received yesterday aft
. ernoon from the Minister of the Interior:
OTTAWA. April 17. â To E. C. Senkter. Cold
Commissioner: Throw open for entry at once
all the lapsed and abandoned claims withheld
from entry by reason of Treadgold concession.
* " SIFTON.
Ten minutes later the Gold Commission
er had a notice posted in his office, throw
ing open to location 3400 placer mining
claims that had been withheld from entry
by reason of the Treadgold concession.
These cover an area of ten square miles.
Since the first of the year 300 reverted
claims fell to Treadgold by reason of the
order in council giving him all abandoned
claims, and these also will now be thrown
open to location.
This will mean a series of the biggest
stampedes for vacant claims ever record
ed in the Klondike country, for most of
the miners here have ground picked out
that they know to be of \-alue, but which
they have been unable to secure because
It was withheld from location for the
benefit of Treadgold.
The concession to A. N. C. Treadgold.
Sir Thomas Tancred and associates was
originally granted last . year. It gave
TTcadgold the exclusive right to take
Â¦water for mining purposes from the Klon
dike River and tributaries, except such
rights as were already given to others,
end to use the water on Hunker. Bear
and Bonanza creeks and tributaries. The
Ti-eadgold syndicate was given all lapsed
claims on those creeks and adjacent hlll
eides "and benches. The amended conces
sion of last December, made public In
February, gave it far greater rights, an
nouncing that the Treadgold syndicate
should have all vacant ground free from
royalty fees for recording .or other ex
penses.
Through the efforts of Governor Ross
and Delegates Wilson and Sugrue at Ot
tawa, aided by telegrams from Dawson.
the Government has been Induced to re
scind this sweeping concession.

REDDING, April 18.â A discovery made
by surveyors ill the woods north of Red
ding, on the opposite side of the Sacra
mento River, which at first seemed mere
ly a novel find, now appears to "have a
deep and far-reaching significance. The
discovery was of a complete railroad and
a mixed train of passenger and box cars,
all in miniature. At first the engineers
who made the find believed they had
come upon the hidden retreat of an in
ventor, but a study of the circumstances
leads to the supposition that' men now in
teresting New York capitalists in project
ed railways liere may.haveÂ»hlt upon the
scheme of placing this miniature railway
system in the woods to justify them tech
nically in declaring that the first division
of a narrow gauge railroad was actually
built, with a train running over it.
T. G. Parker and A. C. Freeland were
running lines for an electric road to Kes
â¢wick and had reached the junction of a
creek and the Sacramento River. At this
point two railroads projected to run from
Eureka or other coast points via Redding
would cross the river. The surveyors
were speculating upon the possibility of
Buch a road being built when suddenly
they came upon a small clearing and
found a perfect railway track, six inches
Â¦wide and twenty yards In length. Lpon
it stood a tiny train, whose locomotive
and five coaches aggregated seven feet
in length. The cars and engine were
turned from wood and titled with wheels
and appliances in exact imitation of a
real engine and coaches. Ingenious boys
could not have built the perfect little
road and train.
The tracks of a man and freshly turned
earth showed that this narrow gauge lim
ited had not been In operation more than
a week. The ferryman at Reids Ferry, a
half-mile away, remembers - having fer
ried a stranger in a buggy, who asked
many questions about the frequency of
visitors to the isolated spot on the river
bank. The stranger returned In an hour
ana hurried away.
It Is believed that a glowing description
of the first division of the projected rail
way may be published in the circulars
used in New York to interest buyers of
stock.

Beebe and his wife have lived in the
neighborhood for some vears, having
come from Oakland. He is about 35 years
of age and she was five years his junior.
It is the opinion of the Coroner that Mrs.
Beebe died from natural causes, but that
she was slightly demented and believed
her husband wanted to get rid of her. No
trace of poison was found in the autopsy.
A number of organs were diseased to
such an extent that death might have re
sulted from several causes.
Sheriff Langford went to the Beebf>
home, to-day to investigate the case.
While the neighbors relate many rumors
and stories told by Mrs. Beebe of her
husband's threats to get rid of her, the
Sheriff is not inclined to the theory of
foul play. Beebe told Langford that there
had been a bottle of laudanum in Vhe
house for four years and that Mrs. Beebe
might have taken some of It yesterday.
He said his wife ; had repeatedly asked
him to give her some laudanum when she
was ill. but he had always refused. He
said he was not at home when she was
taken sick. His wife had frequentlySiad
spells of hysteria, one of these occurring
last evening.
Mrs. Beebe's body was removed to an
undertaking parlor in this city. Coroner
Kell ordered an autopsy, which was per
formed by Drs. Gates and Miller this
afternoon. .
When Mrs. Beebe called on District At
torney Campbell yesterday she said sbs
believed her husband was becoming in
sane from overwork: She said he would
get up at 2 or 3 o'clock In the morning
and work until 10 o'clock at night. She
had the District Attorney write a letter
to Dr. Charles H. Barnes of Los An
geles, a half-brother of Beebe; advising
him of the man's condition and asking
him to Interest himself in the case. Mrs.
Beebe said her husband had not become
afflicted to the extent that she feared he
would harm her. â¢ Another woman was
with Mrs. Beebee at the time.
When taken ill' Mrs. Beebe complained
of a burning sensation in the stomach,
and some of the neighbors - gave her a
concoction of turpentine and sweet oil.
The woman had been doctoring for
months with various physicians. .
Mrs. Beebe returned to her home from
this city about 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon. An hour or so later she was taken
ill, and about 6 o'clock sent her little bqy
to a blacksmith shop in the vicinity to
telephone for Dr. Gates. Beebe was not
home at the time, but he met the boy
going to telephone and he went on the
errand himself. Dr. Gates went out and
prescribed for Mrs. Beebe. Some of the
neighbors were with her. At 8 â¢ o'clock
Mrs. Beebe told Mrs. Garvey and other
neighbors not to let her go to sleep, as
her husband had given her a big dose of
laudanum and if she- went to sleep she
would never awaken. Despite the efforts
of her attendants Mrs. Beebe fell asleep
Late in the night Dr. Miller was called
to attend her, the people being unable to
find Dr. Gates. Mrs. Beebe died at . I
o'clock this morning.
The little settlement of orchardists in
that locality, which is three and a half
miles southwest of this city, is greatly
excited. Mrs. Beebe I had told the
neighbors that she and her husband did
not get along well together, and only yes
terday she went to District Attorney
Campbell and told him she believed her
husband was becoming Insane. These
facts and her sudden death have thrown
a mystery about the case, which both
Sheriff Langford and Coroner Kell are
trying to solve. One theory advanced by
the officers is that the woman was in
sane. \

has been ordered for the Presto, and no
racing will be done until these are ready.

The high jump will be close - between
Henley. and Bell of Stanford and Cooley,
Powell and Cheek of California, . Hussey
and Topham of California and Bell and
Henley of Stanford will be the main con
testants in the broad jump. Berkeley
looks for first place through Hussey. : -
Stanford should .get the pole vault' If
Henley's ankle is not too bad. Wllcox of
California should follow him for second
place.
The winner of the relay la hard;to se
lect. Each university has several men en
tered, although but four will take part on
a side. California has such athletes as
Service, Cadogan. Brown, Powell, Ligda,
Howard and others to choose from, while
Stanford has Dunn, Smith, Crossman,
Dole, Davis, Fowler and others.
Plaw has the hammer throw without
doubt, but in the shot put the contest be
tween him and Hyde of Stanford will be
close. The outcome is doubtful. Hartline
and Albertson of California stand good
chances for. second and third in the ham
mer throw. ._."-.' V
Cadogan is picked the first place man
In the 100 .and 220 yard dashes. Abadie
and Brown should- show up well in both,
although McCaughern of Stanford is gen
erally conceded a place in each event. Â¦
In the hurdles California looks for the
first two places through Cheek and Pow
ell. Hannigan has been coming up In his
work and may also score.
The 440 yard dash Is conceded to ! Stan
ford, which has Smith and Dunn for win
ners. Either Ligda, Howard, Adler or
Kuster should get third at least.. Powell
and Service are entered, but will probably
not compete.
In the two mile run Tibbetts and West
dahl are picked for first and second places
for . California. Service is expected to
win the half-mile, with Stanford probably
second and third.
In the mile run California looks for first
place through Redewill, with possible sec
ond and third by Woods and Graves. Ser
vice Is entered, but not expected to run.
California's men, taken as a whole, are
In good condition. The past two weeks
have been spent in training on the soft
surface of the Alameda' speedway and
this has relieved^ the soreness caused by
training on the ' hard cinders. Service,
Cadogan and Powell are important excep
tions of the general rule of "good condi
tion." Cadogan has "shln-spllnt,"/ caused
by work on the hard tracK. Service is
not. up to his usual form and Powell has a
bad knee. Their conditions will not keep
them out of the field day and the first two
named, at least, are expected to win their
events.
BERKELEY, April 18.â California ex
pects to win' at Palo Alto to-morrow and
to win by no uncertain ecore. The athletes
are confident of it and the students have
no doubts in their minds. They concede
Stanford some points and even first
places, but they expect an easy victory
with all that.
California Expects to Win.
If either of the two contests result In a
cardinal victory it should be the tennis
match. Harry Weihe, the only former
varsity tennis player in college, will ap
pear in both singles and doubles, and on
him the hppes for a Stanford victory
must be pinned. Cleveland H. Baker, *03,
will be the other singles man. He plays
a hard, steady game, but has hardly
shown himself to be In a class with Mac-
Gavin, against whom he will be pitted.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton does not ex
pect his, men to win the field day from
the California team, but there are some
events In . which he feels confident the
Stanford men will come to the front. Ar
thur S. Henley, '04, does not expect to en
ter any of the events, as the risk of fur
ther injuring his ankle would be too
great. This, means a loss of several
points to Stanford, as Henley was count
ed on to be the cardinal's strongest point
winner. Smith, '03, and uunn, '04, will
compel the California man who expects
to win the quarter-mile run to put up an
exceedingly fast race. Both men have
made the distance in :52 2-5. Stanford
will also have a fast relay team, as there
is an abundance of good material to draw
from. t
and Californiaâ the first being the
tennis tournament on the California Club
courts In San FrancUco and the second
the annual track meet, which will take
place on the Stanford oval. Stanford has
neither expectation nor prospect of win
ning either, but the respective teams are
prepared to put up their best efforts. ;

The first regatta to be given by the Dol

races. The second regatta will consist of
outrigged skiff races and the committee
In oharse will ask the club to offer a

It is probable a four-oared shell race
will be on the Lake Merritt programme,
as the University of California Boating
Association now possesses a shell, and
the South End Rowing Club has one
which will probably be overhaulded and
put Into commission.
S. J. Pembroke thinks it would be well
to soend less money in trophies^ and de
vote more to bringing crews from other
cities to compete at the annual regattas.
If transportation and hotel expenses can
be guaranteed, it will be possible to get
crews from Stockton and also from As
toria to enter the Lake Merritt races.
The president of the Merchants' Exchange
of Oakland has appointed G. W. Arper.
Theodore Gier. D. C. Brown, A. D. Sin

The Alameda Boating Club has decided
to open the season on Sunday, May 20,
with barge, shell and skiff races,- swim
ming contests and other aquatic cports,
such as walking the greasy pole and chas
ing the duck. Music will be provided by
the Alameda Band. The day's â¢proceed
ings will start at 10 in the morning. Five
junior barge crews have been made up.
No. 1 consisting-of George Renner, bow;
Fred Farrar, No. 2; Fawn Natt, No. 3;

The committee in chargeof the iiind for
builtJtnr a new boathouse -for the Ariels
has been increased and will give another
boxing entertainment on May 7. James
Wilson will be matchmaker arid the tour
nament will take place in the annex to
the Mechanics' Pavilion. '
As the club now owns a new outrigged
skiff, it will be represented in the ski!I
races at the annual regatta on Lake Mer
ritt. At a meeting held at the Mer
chants' Exchange, Oakland, on Tuesday
night. Captain S. J. Pembroke presented
a letter from Percy E. Btowell on behalf
of the Portland Rowing Club, stating that
the Oregonians hope to have representa~
tives present at the Lake Menitt regatta.
The Portlanders, however, have already
arranged to send two four-oared crews,
junior and senior single scullers and also
competitors in the double sculling race to
the annual regatta of the North Pacific
Association of Amateur Oarsmen, which
will be held at Nelson, B. C. As the ex
penses connected with that event will be
heavy, the Portlanders will be unable to
visit San Francisco unless their trans
portation and hotel bills are paid. If the
Oakland committee will do this, the club
will send a four-oar and a single
Bculler. If the arrangements can be made,
the Portland Rowing Club will send down
the best available oarsmen, as they are
anxious to have a really good trial of
strength with the rowing men of Cai
fornia. The Portlanders have no barges,
but are willing to row a barge race if they
can set the loan of one.
There was a large attendance of mem
ters at the Olympic boathousÂ© last
Sunday and on Monday night several of
the men went through exercises at the
Olympic Club. Captain S. J. Pembroke has
picked out a new crew for the junior barge,
which will race against other crews in
the monthly regattas.
THE prospect for an active rowing
season is good, notwithstanding the
fact that some of the clubs are
handicapped by lack of quarters.

Hickey of Sacramento Proves Easy
Hark for the Batsmen.
LOS ANGELES. April 18.â Hickey of
the Sacramentos was an easy mark for
the home team to-day, while McPartlin
was effective after the second inning.
Hickey might have held the locals down
to a closer score had his support been
good. Ragged fielding and lack of team
work were the most notable feature? of
the Senators' playing. Anderson of Los
Angeles was the star batter of the day,
finding Hickey for two three-baggers and
a single. Fisher will try his new pitcher
Thomas to-morrow. Score:

He Is Supposed to Tell His Troubles
to Blitzen, the "Iron Horse"
of Guttenberg.
Michael F. Dwyer, at one time one of
the most prominent figures on the Amer
ican turf, took Banquet, a famous: race
horse, to England. Banquet broke down
soon afterward and was retired from the
turf. He is drawing a cab in London
and that he is not satisfied with his lot
is evidenced by a letter to a former
lriend, as translated by a Mall and Ex
press man. The' letter 'is addressed to
Blitzen, the far-famed "iron horse" of
Guttenberg. He .was raced regularly six
days a week. The letter reads :
Blitzen, care Colonel -Pepper, U. S. A. â My
Dear Blluen: Little did.I think when I em
barked for Old England -with Dick Croker and
Mike Dwyer that I would never return to the
dear land of my triumphs. It's a shame and
an outrage how they treated me after all the
money I won for them in America. To think
that Banquet. -who often carried all the money
of the talent â Banquet, the pride of the fair
sex and the king of the paddock, should now
be hauling a cab for an abusive driver! It
gives me the heaves to think of It!
It wouldn't, be so bad If he was only an
American, but to be submitted to the constant
Indignity and nerve-racking, head-splitting
abuse In cockney Is awful. l .
Of course, you don't know what suffering a
ringbone causes one, and I hepe you never will.
Yes, I have one. I wouldn't mind being short
of wind bo much, as you can bluff them out
on that proposition, but a ringbone doesn't
give you any rest. The pain Is something
awful. What are they doing for them in
America now? They used to blister them, I
believe, though I never paid much attention
In â¢ the red days, and we never knew much
about that sort of thlnz.
You see, my leg got a bat coming over, and
they rushed me too much. I couldn't deliver
the goods, though I almost beat the lobsters
I met over hero on three legB the first time I
ran. Dwyer was sore and so was Croker. By
the way. I understand Seth Low came in on
the bit. Just rolled home the other day In
New York. Heard a coupl* of Americans talk
ing about It. ,
I am glad Croker lost. Croker said to Mike
that they had better put me in with a bunch of
telling-platers and see what I could do. They
made a good bet on me on that race, and I
soaked them at the post. An English army
officer bought me and was going to take me to
India. I'll never forget the day. It was the
last time I ever saw Dwyer or Croker, either.
They let me go, and I guess they knew, what
I suspected myself by that time, that my off
hind leg was on the bum. I kept up the bluff
for a while and was treated right by the Eng
lishman, who gave orders that nothing was too
good for me. "But the vets caught on. They
caw there was something bad coming Just
above the hoof, and that could be only one
thing â ringbone. I went at auction to a dealer
and he blistered and liked to burned the hoof
off me. It made It all right for a while, but it
was sure to come out in the wash. So here I
am. BUtzen. one time a thoroughbred, now
hauling a cab in London. _
Well, goodby; take care of yourself. And,
say, don't forget the new ringbone ' cure if
they have one. BANQUET.

COMPI/AINT OF BATJ-QTTET,
ONCE FAMOUS RACE HORSE
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals have begun
an investigation of the use of burrs on
bits of. horses driven by the fashionable
set. Several people who have carriages
of their own have already been called to
account for this form, of cruelty and Sec
retary Holbrbok states that If necessary
he shall begin to make arrests.
'-â¢ The burr Is made of a circular piece of
leather, through which bristles protrude
about a quarter of an Inch.
One of these contrivances is fastened on
each end of the bit In such a manner that
the bristles strike against the horse's
mouth. The theory is that animals with
this equipment will be more submissive to
the rein and more stylish in appearance,
as they are constantly tossing their heads
in the effort to become free from the
burr.
The members of New York's "four hun
dred" were using the contrivance quite
extensively a Â¦ few months ago, but the
practice was stopped through force of
public sentiment. The humane- society
officials intend that the outcome In this
city will be the same as that In New
York. -
. At the regular meeting of the society
held yesterday it was shown that 230 ani
mals had been relieved during ?ast month.
Seven persons have been convicted of
cruelty to animals through the agency of
the society officials during the same
period. .
Officer Hooper arrested E. "Williams of
Oakland yesterday for . overloading his
wagon and abusing his horses. -;i '.

.- ILL KNAPP did not have to" per
)/ form any ten-mile stunt on the
~^ road to do 75 pounds on .Bragg In
t^JJ the seven Â¦ furlong handicap at
Oakland yesterday. ': .""Â¦Â¦Â¦
He was compelled, however, for the first
time this season to remove his every-day
work clothes to make the weight. .Bill
then came close to creating a disturbance,
for I Flush of Gold, piloted by Johnny
Hoar, only beat his mount a neck- ,
There were nine starters, in the race,
and Mr. Brooks' handling of the weights
certainly furnished a most vexing propo
sition, as every one of the starters looked
to have a chance. The smart money went
In on Constellator.with 107 pounds up, the
Ryan entry closing a 2 to 1 choice after
opening at 3. He was- cut off and pock
eted on the backstretch. never getting a
chance to show what he really couddo.
At the start Troxler on Hagerdon slipped
away first, with Byron Rose as traveling
companion. When the Â¦*'Â£<â¢*]""
reached the last named horse had fallen
back and Bragg trailed at the heels of
Hagerdon. Hard work told on Hagerdon
ana at the paddock ..Bragg looked tho
winner, when Flush of Gold closed on the
outside with a rush,' beating the light
weight out a neck in 1:27. Hagerdon was
third, a length before La Goleta. \V Mio
See on Divina tried the trick of Jabbing
an oyster can through the eyÂ« of a needle
and of course did not succeed. At the
head of the stretch "he attempted to go
through on the rail and "brought up sev
enth at the wire. -..
The card was, .an '-.attractive one and
drew a large attendance. Favorites man
aged to hold their own, capturing three of
the six' events. r^'Yl
An unexpected happening was the de
feat of Bell Reed, favorite for the two
vear-old dash, by Barney Schreiber's filly
Sylvia Talbot. Johnny Hoar on the first
choice repeatedly tried to beat the barrier,
but eventually got the worst of it. Roscoe
Troxler soon had Sylvia in the lead and
despite Hoar's hard urging the favorite
could not make up the ground lost early,
getting in three lengths late in M*i.
Amoruna ran third.
For the Introductory five furlong scram
ble Solinus, backed from 8 to 5 down to
even money, simply spreadeagled his field.
Eight lengths farther away El Pllar took
the place from Rlonda, a 20 to 1 shot
played to 7. There was a hot tip out on
Snooze, but the filly gave It up in the
stretch.
James Nealon's sprinter, Dr. Boyle, had
one of. his old-time tantrums at the post
in the seven-furlong event, refusing to
break away from the barrier. Jimmy
Bozeman on Sly, the 9 to 6 favorite, rode
a cleverly rated race, winning from Matt
Hogan at the wire. Show honors went to
Golden Light.
Fifteen cheap platers lined up in the
six and a half furlong selling run, with
Devereux ruling a mild favorite. He led
for a quarter and then blew up. Mar
ineuse took the front position In the
stretch and in a driving finish downed the
15 to 1 shot Mike Rice a head. The win
ner was 8 to 1. .
"Longshot" Conley astride Wolhurst
turned up a handy winner of the final
mile and a sixteenth event, starting.a 9 to
5 favorite. McNamara in a drive dis
posed of Expedient for the place.
THE annual intercollegate tennis
matches between Stanford and the
University of California will be
. played on the California Club courts
at Bush and Scott streets this morning.
The games will commence at 9 o'clock
sharp. . " â¢ -,
Up to the present week the chances, of
Stanford were considered ratherpoor, but
the cardinal players have shown great
improvement' lately and are expected to
put up a great Â¦ -fight. t Several changes
have been made in the line-up of both
teams. -Instead of Weihe and Baker play
ing the doubles the latter's place will be
taken by Frank Lleb. This will un
doubtedly make . a much stronger com
bination, as LJeb Is a better doubles play
er than Baker. The latter will be the
second 'man in singles and will meet
Drummond McGavin, Berkeley's second
man. This match Is almost certain to go
to California, as MacGavin outclasses
Baker. The match that is looked forward
to with the most interest is the Hunt-
Welhe match. These men are two of the
best in the first class and are evenly
matched. The odds are slightly In Hunt's
favor, as he has put in the last few
months practicing hard, while Weihe has
been unable to get any practice on ac
count of the poor condition of the Stan
ford courts. Weihe plays an aggressive,
fast game, while that of his opponent- is
Just the opposite. Hunt is wonderfully
steady, and- counts mostly on wearing his
opponent out.
In doubles the chances are about even.
Of the four men Weihe is easily the best
doubles player, and with any kind of sup
port from his partner should give the
Berkeley men a hard game. California
has an abundance of good material this
year, but has shown poor Judgment in
the selection of its men. With Drum
mond MacGavin in George Baker's place
the University of California men would
be almost sure to win, as the former is
an excellent man in doubles. In singles
MacGavin Is erratic, on some days play
ing brilliant tennis and on others being
poor. Baker Is fully as good a man In
singles and is much steadier than Mac-
Gavin, but does not understand doubles
as does the latter.
The matches to be played Â¦will be as fol
lows: Harry "Weihe, Stanford, vs. Reu
ben Hunt, California; Cleveland Baker,
Stanford, vs. Drummond MacGavin, Cali
fornia; Weihe and Frank Lieb, Stanford,
vs. Hunt and George Baker. California.
All matches will be the best two sets in
three.
The invitation tournament to be held at
Penryn, Placer County, will bring out
some of the best tennis ever seen on the
coast. Eight of the best players in the
State will take part, and the Citrus Col
ony Club will undoubtedly be treated to
some fine tennis. The men who have been
Invited â¢ to participate are the Hardy
brothers. Whitney brothers, Professor
Daily. H. W. Crowell. W. B. Collier and
Grant Smith. The date of the tourna
ments is the 3d and 4th of May.'
The OJai Valley enthusiasts will hold
their yearly championship tournaments
next Thursday, Friday and ' Saturday.
Mrs. Kincald is the only local player who
will take part. It . is not expected that
she will wrest the championship from.

Ewing's talent rules supreme in ball
circles. Every crank looks at them with
awe and nudges his neighbor with the re
mark. "They're the goods, the real thing
and any nine that can skin them takes
the money."
They met the Ponies again yesterday
and made them look like a bunch Â¦ of
truck horses who did not get any midday
meal. They ran bases so fast the local
players thought they were running for
oftice and the Infield slammed the ball
around so lively as to make several- ping
pong players weep. The score, after a
full 25 cents' worth of fun had been
passed out, was: Oakland 3, Ponies 2. .
Aside from the closeness of the contest.
a triple play was enacted In the first
round, the first seen on the local field in
several years. McHale was safe on
i'rancks' error and Bone and Lawler
walked. It looked bad for Oakland. Croll
hit a sharp infield fly toward second.
Mohler made a great run, caught the bail,
threw to FrancKs. who retired Bone at
second, while Francks lined the sphere
Into Streib's mitt before Lawler had a
chance to touch the bag. It was all done
bo quickly the Ponies were absolutely be
wilciered and half the crowd did not real
ize what had occurred for nearly five
minutes.
Kar.e and Moskiman shot against each
other and both were mysterious In the
goods they offered. Kane was unsteady
at times, but the. Oaklands never could
do him any damage. The Doctor was the
same cool, graceful, effective twirler who
has faced so many batsmen on the differ
ent California diamonds. He was a little
lavi&h in his distribution of passes at
times, but he fielded his position in grand
style and throughout the struggle acted
In a manner which would have made Jim
Hart of Chicago weep had he been among
those present.
The suburbans scored one in the initial
round. Mohler and Streib drew four bad
ones and Immediately executed a pretty
double steal. Brick Devereaux also ar
rived at first on Kane's generosity and
Dunleavy followed suit, scoring Mohler.
Mohler was there again In the fifth. He
hit a rattler to center for half the trip.
Streib again worked Kane for a ticket
and they did the double steal stunt for
the second time. The wee fellow regis
tered-when McCreedie died by the first
st-cond route.
For the Ponies Holly opened round two
with a singing double to left territory and
tied the score on Streib's overthrow to
third base. Delmas completed the local
doings in the eighth on a pass, a sacri
fice and Lawler's wallop to left.
With the board reading two all, Dun
leavy started hostilities In the ninth with
a hot drive to second. Francks was
passed and both advanced on Mother
Pete's sacrifice. The Doctor drove a liner
to Delmas, who fumbled. Dunleavy end
ed the argument with a run.
Croll, who did tricks with them last
season, acted as right field galloper for
the little horses and Delmas cut a few
capers at first. Gorton of Oakland hurt
himself in the second spasm, so old St.
Peter Lohman received the doctor's of
ferings. All the members of Oakland's
infield did splendid work, while their bet
ter playing all around won for them the
money and shouting. The score:

Play will begin at 1:30 p. m. and the links
will be. open from April 19 to- members of
other cluba who desire to enter the com
petition. Two prizes will be given. The
San Rafael Golf Club chose this date for
the open contest that golfers may be
more readily Induced to enter from other
clubs, when they nnd they can play In
an open competition on the Presidio links
on May 1, and two days later can enter a
similar contest at San Rafael.
â¢As two or three of the men who repre
sented San Francisco in the lnterclub
match against Oakland last Saturday will
not be available to-day. It is possible the
teams will consist of six Instead of eight

"proposed to play oS the tie on the links

being played In the morning and eighteen
In the afternoon. . This j Is a departure

willing. Vice Captain P. E. Bowles, who
has charge of the match for Oakland, Is
consulting the members of his team oa
the matter. If all the Oakland team but
one can devote the whole day to tha

sulted.
This morning at 9:30 a competition for
women begins on the links of the San
Rafael Golf Club, the contestants being
those who have not during the present

from the Pacific\Mail Steamship Company, in its
handling of Chinese coolies. The company admits
that the detention shed on the Mail dock is construc

company is responsible for coolies there in custody.
This information will be worth remembering when a

Petaluma Courier (Dem.): .
A marked copy of ' the " Sacramento Sunday
News t3es to tell how Governor Gage w/s the
salvation of California during 'the bubonic
plague excitement in an editorial half a column
long. In another editorial he tells of how
the Governor is Justified In being a boss be
cause forsooth ' Spreckels and Do You ne. boss
the other wings of the Republican party... It
isn't nice to find out that Republicans need
bosses to herd them up no the -polls properly,
although they -haven't much chance of winning
otherwise.' Governor Gage tried â¢ the hardest
he was able to get Dan Burns elected Senator
from 'California, and when he found himself
unable to do that dead-locked the Legislature.
Governor Gage Is a birdjy But he controls but
one wine, and that doesn't enable him to
attain any,. extended elevation In .flisht.
But it Is hardly fair In the Chronicle or
The Call or the Times of this city.' the tBree
leading Republican papers of- the State, to
deny him due credit for any decided service
he may have done the State.
'By the way, -one of the recent straws show-
Ing the direction of the wind, Is the election
of anti-Gage officers by the Union League
Club of this city. . ,
The News Is not a -partisan sheet. It Is
an Independent, free-lance Journal In politics,
religion and every other field. . As a looker
on it sees that Gage cannot be renominated
nor re-elected; that he is In no sense a man
of â¢ the ; people, but Is a public man of the
Dan Burns-machine order. The News Judged
him by the speeches and the canvass he made
during* the last campaign, and, using a rail
road figure pronounced him a "narrow-Gage.'-
He has certainly done very, little to entitle him
to a second term.
Los Angeles News (Ind.) :
General Shafter would be far- mcrÂ» popular
as nominee than Governor Gage, as we view
the situation.
Bell that he will accept the Republican nomi
nation for Governor. General Shatter Is one
of the Spanish- American War heroes. Ha may
be a good soldier, but he is likely to meet his
Waterloo when he gets Into politics. If the
general: has any other qualification for the of
fice other than breadth of beam the public
has never heard of It. â Woodland Democrat.
I General Shatter Is a large man bodily, but
that does not detract from his ability. A per
sonal acquaintance with the general would re
move to a certain extent the prejudice of the
editor of the Democrat. He is a genial gentle
man,- entertaining ln : conversation, and can
make a good speech on almost any subject of
public interest. . In point of ability General
Shafter will compare favorably with General
Stoneman when he was Governor of California,
and it 4s conceded that Stoneman made a very
good, record as chief executive of the State.

Vallejo Times (Dein.): . ;
Flint's friends have reorganized the Union
League Club of Los Angeles. This is said to
be a distinct victory over Gage's- forces. .
NON-PARTISANS AND DEMOCRATS.
Democratic journals and the newspapers of independent tendencies thus, speak of the conflict in the Rcpublidaa
Pel Norta Record:
Â¦While the San Francisco papers credit Gag*
wlUThavlBg a solid delegation in the Republic
can State convention from Del Norte County,
there appears to be a feeling here that such
will not be the case. A great many of thÂ»
"faithful" would like to see a northern man
at the head of the ticket.' Edson for Instance.
The reports from Illinois were to the effect that
the political managers of the various Senatorial aspir
ants are already in the field canvassing the Assembly
districts and pledging candidates to support one or
the other of the would-be Senators. Large sums of
money are of course necessary for that sort- of can
vassing, and if a man be not a millionaire he must
have the backing of corporations in making tlie fight.
That in itself is bad enough, but the worst is. that
such campaigning prevents the election of fit men to
the Legislature, and v thus leads to further corruption
in legislative work. Even where' there is no gross
corruption there is always indifference to the public
welfare on the part of men who owe their election
solely to their relations to a political boss^ â¢' -.-,
Here, then, is a threatening prospect of another
Senatorial wrangle which will be as disgraceful as
that of Addicks in Delaware and that of Clark iin
Montana.y Moreover it is going to distract. State
politics in West Virginia from now until the winter
of 1905, when the election by the Legislature is to
take place. During the whole of that time the gravest
State issues will be set aside or used for. the purpose
of., promoting the candidacy of one of the three mil
lionaires who wishes a seat in the. United States Sen T
ate and is willing to pay for it.
The manner in which the contest is being waged
is revealed in a recent report from the State, which
among other things says: "Caldwell is to be downed
at any cost, is the word brought from Senator Scott;
and Caldwell says he will win, no matter what it
costs him. Schmuelbach is willing to pay his money
into the contest, and it promises to be a campaign
of flowing gold."
In West Virginia three millionaires are in the field
for the honor of succeeding Senator Scott. One of
lhjem is the Senator himself, who is a mine owner and
a banker; another is James L. Caldwell, banker and
railroad president, while the third is Henry Schmuel
bach, a wealthy brewer. Scott's term does not end
until March, 1005; and yet the struggle for the suc r
cessorship is already disturbing the whole political
system of the State.
RECENTLY The Call directed attention to cer
tain reports of the progress of the campaign 1
in Illinois as an object lesson showing the
evils of the present plan of electing United_ States
Senators. It is now to be noted that the campaign
in West Virginia is just about as instructive a
lessen as that in Illinois. 'In each State the selection
of candidates for the Legislature is to be subordinated
to the rivalries of the candidates for the Senatorship,
and the choice will be determined not by the fitness
of any of- them for legislative work, but by his allegi
ance to this, or that aspirant for the Senate.^,
: Those in Kansas who know him best predict that
the new Commissioner will ably fulfill the best ex
pectations of the country. He has been a -faithful
worker.all hislife, and is one of the men who were
most efficient, in breaking the hold of Populism upon
Kansas; and restoring the State to sane politics. Even
those who ;regret the removal of Evans commend the
choice made for his successor,: and it seems therefore
that it is to be accounted one- of the "successes of the
administration. : . . . :'^i .â¢ . &'-<;.
Fortunately for'his reputation he has given the
world much better verse than that, and/more fortu
nately still, he enters his high office with something
more than literary talent. Hardly any position-under
the Government is more difficult to.fill.than that of
Commissioner of Pensions, for there swarms 'around
the Pension Bureau a veritable horde of hungry at
torney s absolutely unscrupulous asjto- the means they
employ to obtain a pension fo/a client, no matter
how. fraudulent his claim may be.
In Kansas Mr. Ware is known as a lawyer of extra?.
ordinary ability and a. practical politician, but
throughout the country .' he is best known, by his
writings, published over the riom de plume "Iron
quill." His verses range all the way from nonsense
to a high order of genuine poetry. He is the author
of the jingle that everybody was repeating a few
years agoâ '; ' - -Â¦

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT may have -com ;
milted â¢ a â¢ blunder in accepting the ' resignation
of Commissioner Evans of the' Pension Bu
reau,-but if so he has redeemed it by the selection of
Eugene F. Ware to fill the place. The new Com
missioner is a gentleman of versatility. He was born
in Connecticut, got his wife in New York, entered
the army from Iowa and lives in Kansas. He is a
soldier, a lawyer, a politician, a legislator and a poet.
What more can be asked of any man?

ANOTHER OBJECT LESSON.
It' now. transpires. Â¦- as was: expected,* that
a large majority of the Republican? who came
In from' the -outside a ndi voted-: for * the t Gage
programme ' on Monday evening . did "hot ' know
what' they were voting for. ' Since they have
found out they are outspoken in letting It be
known' that they are not for Gage. They did
not know that the whole scheme was simply
to capture the organization of the Pomona
Valley Club for Gage and then
herald it to the world as a sweeping Gage
victory in an anti-Gage stronghold; and , it
has leaked out that in anticipation of such a
victory â¢ an announcement of it had already
been drafted and was ready - to send out to
the press. And the Republicans who profess
to.be anti-Gage and joined In thÂ§ attempt s to
capture the Republican club here for (he
Governor are making a sorry exhibition ' of
themselves in trying to square things with the
Pomona Progress:
The San Francisco Call tells the truth and
shows plainly why Gage should .not be re
seated In the gubernatorial chair which .has
been polluted by his actions since 'occupying
the seat. .
Pinole Times:
going to submit to boss rule in their cities or in their State. ; The interests of the South
ern Pacific Railroad are on the side of the interests of the people. Mr. Harriman should
study the situation. He can gain nothing by retaining Herrin and subsidizing corrupt
politicians. He . can secure the rightful interests of his road only by combining with the
people or by abstaining from politics altogether.
After this experience it would appear; to be to the
advantage of the railroad as well as to that of the
public if future dealings of; the roads with the com
mission be carried on through' the business officers
of the road who understand' traffic and the relation
of income to expenditure,^ and not through the law
department, which, under its present management,
has been completely discredited.
The compromise as a will be accepted by
the public as a fairly satisfactory solution of an ugly
and vexatious problem. All that is desired has not
been gained, but it is to be borne in mind that it is
by no means certain that the wholo could have been
gained even had the fight been persistently prose
cuted. The lawsuit would almost certainly have, been
prolonged, and the outcome was doubtful. The com
promise, therefore, may be accepted as judicious and
commendable. . . â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦
A significant feature of the compromise is that so
far as the Southern Pacific Company is. concerned it
was made by the business manager of the road and
not.through-the law and politics department manipu
lated by Billy Herrin. It will be remembered that
Herrin, with great volubility and much emphasis,
declared to the Commissioners and to the courts that
his road could not possibly carry oil at less than the
high figures of the old rates. He asserted that any
reduction would mean ruin. We now learn what
those assertions arid declarations were *orth. The
traffic managers and business men of the road, who
devote themselves to railroading and ! let politics
alone, conclude that considerable reductions can be
made, and, what is more, they agree wjth the Rail
road Commissioners to make them almost at once.
An important feature of the compromise is that
the rates agreed 'upon will go into operation within
twenty days. That fact in itself is a strong argu
ment in favor of the compromise, for had the com
mission continued to fight in the courts for the whole
amount of the^proposed reduction the case might
have been held up for years. A half loaf is better
than no bread, and in this case the gain is consid
erably more than a half loaf.
The gain for the public by the establishment of the
new rates is considerable. It amounts to a reduction
of 5 cents per barrel on shipments to San Fran
cisco, or about $7 50 per carload. It is estimated
that under existing conditions of the oil industry the
net returns per car will be increased from 20 to 25
per cent. Such gain may be expected to improve
the industry and stimulate its activity, so that much
of the benefit will accrue to the public, and the con
sumer will share in it with the producer.
The terms of the agreement provide for the estab
lishment of the following rates: "For shipment in
carload lots â Per barrel of 42 gallons,- from Bakers
field and Coalinga to San Francisco and all inter
mediate points, and all points of consignment north
of Bakersfield in this State where the rate charged
has hitherto been 42 cents per barrel, 37.8 cents; for
transportation over the switch or spur track into the
Kern River oil district, extending from main lines of
railroad operated by Southern Pacific Company
arid the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway
Company, per barrel of 42 gallons, "shipped from Oil
City on said spur track or intermediate points to
Â¦said main line, when destined beyond Bakersfield,
2 2-3 cents; car loaded to capacity, minimum charge
per car, $4; per barrel of 42 gallons, shipped from
any point on said spur track more distant from said
main line than said Oil City, when destined beyond
Bakersfield, 4 cents; car loaded to capacity, minimum
charge per car, $6." :
BY airangement between the Railroad Commis
iioners and the roads the oil rate litigation
has been brought to a summary conclusion.
The results are beneficial to the public. The Com
missioners not only put an end to what threatened
to be a prolonged lawsuit, but they gain substantial
justice for the public in the form of a large reduction
in railway rates. V
A JUDICIOUS COMPROMISE.
The apologrists for Governor Gage assert in
his defense that, he is a good fighter, that he
stands by his friends, that he has caused a
low State tax levy to be made. So much
may be admitted. He is a good fighter, as
good as any Indian, and he stands by his
friends â ye sods, what friends'! â and he did
cause a low tax levy to -be made this year 1 â
by the same sort of methods employed by Jim
Budd, holding: back : appropriations that, ought
to have been made and will have to 'be made
up next year. We want all this tn a Gover
nor, but we want more. We want a flehter
who will fight for what. is for. the good of the
State. . WÂ« want a Governor who will < stand
by friends outside and not inside the push.
We want economy In public expenditure, but
we want something done for the building of
the commonwealth and Gage Is not the man
for a large minded, progressive administration.

The worst evil in California politics has been
corporation control; ' Against* his express pub
lic pledge. Governor Gage has - chosen for bis
closest advisers the hired representatives of
the m#st corrupting political corporation in.
California. He has chosen for appointment to
office some ; of the most notorious of the pro
fessional corruptera of politics of the State.
He has used the power. of his. office to gain
practically dictatorial control of the Legisla
ture of the State, and has then used that con
trol to force through some of the most vicious
legislation-, proposed, while opposing- or veto-
Ing some of the most important and salutary
measures. He has secured the passage of a
bill fixing the terms of the appointive officers
so that they expire- : after the adjournment of
the Legislature, thus practically nullifying the
constitutional authority of the Senate to con
firm nominations. He sought to have passed,
and placed it among- the emergency measures
for which he called the Legislature in extra
Fresno Republican:
It Is becoming Increasingly evident that If
the next Republican convention Is. In any
sense representative of the Republican party
of the State, Governor Gage cannot be re
nomlnated. The problem, then, Is to see to
It that tho convention does represent the party,
and not . the narrow set of professional seek
ers for official favor who, too often, consti
tute the dominant element In State conven-
tlons. Against Gage are practically all the
newspapers and the whole body of the people
of the State. In his favor are the Southern
Pacific Railroad, Its hired attorneys and lob
byists, the politicians who have always done
Its bidding, State office holders "and their
satellites, and the whole mass of thÂ» "push"
whom old companionship In iniquity has
habituated to acting together. . In actual num
bers the people who are against Gage so over
whelmingly outnumber the few politicians who
are for him that In any actual test of votes
there would practically bo only one side to tha
conflict. That, under these circumstances.
Gage is still the most formidable of all the
candidates, so formidable that it Is practically
Gage on one side and all the remaining can
didates on the other, Is a sad commentary on
the habitual abdication of the people in favor
of the rolitlclans when 'It comes to choosing
candidates for office.
Since the situation Is perfectly plain, how
ever, the Remedy Is as plain. The delegates
to the next State convention must represent the
party, not the "push." The rank and file of
the party can determine the selection of dele
gates if they will take the trouble. They must
take tha trouble. It Is not a question of get
ting one man or another, for Governor. There
are plenty of men who would make good Gov
ernors, and those who would personally prefer
any one of these can easily afford to stand by
any other of them. - But it is a question of
approving, or disapproving an administration
which has become the representative of all the
pernicious .influences- and methods In Califor
nia politics. "Â¦* - â¢Â¦" â¢' Â¦ -
Bed Bluff Sentinel:
. It is true that Senator Gillette haÂ» always
been against the machine, and therein; lies his
present strength. He. stood > by the people as
a Senator, and upon- that platform he went be
fore the convention at Santa Cruz and was
a formidable opponent, and would have won
had he declared himself in tbe start. North
ern California had been betrayed by Laird and
Jlllson. and was ready for revolt. Siskiyou.
always Independent, came out solid for Gillette.
The feeling against the machine never was
stronger in the north than rtght now. Â¦ If Sen
ator Gillette stands by his colors nothing can
prevent him from being nominated' and elected.
While, on the other hand, if nominated by the
machine, he Is doomed to defeat at the. polls.
It 13 no time for him to extend the oliva
branch, to the machine when the machine is
dead. and. we believe that he Is shrewd enough
to know that Burns* support would only bÂ«
tendered to him . for the 'very purpose of com
passing his defeat.. ' '. . -' . _,.
The situation. In HumbokU as It now ap
pears demands that Senator Gillette let -his own
position be known to the people of the First
Congressional District. They will take no
chances.. Humboldt must be In " the right
column or relinquish her right to a Congress
man. Â¦."-â¢.â¢'Â¦-â¢- â¢ â¢
THE opinion is clearly expressed by the leading men and influential newspapers of the State that party, harmon?
cannot be achieved under Qage: leadership. It required great skill, dexterity and conciliation on the part of hia
managers at San Jose to obtain an indorsement of a mere perfunctory resolution in which his name
was mentioned. Had thejre been the slightest attempt to secure indorsement of his candidacy for another term the
Gageites would have been overwhelmed. As it was! the mention of the Governor's name evoked but little applause,
and that little was confined to abunch of State office-holders. Four years ago when Gage ran for Governor he was
supported by all the newspapers of the party. Republican orators went to the platform and spoke for the success of
the ticket. Harmony prevailed in the party and victory was gained. It is a remarkable fact that the forces winch
won success for Gage four. years ago are foremost in opposition to his present candidacy. In. 1898 appeals were made to
the conscience, the patriotism and the public spirit of Californians in his behalf. Now, since he has lost the stalwart
Republican supjptJrt, he is appealing to the push elements of the Democratic party for aid. As an index of public senti
ment the following excerpts from the i press of the. State are republished:
Los Angeles Times: "'Â¦Â¦ ,
The California Code Commission Â¦ Is another
rotten. feature of Gage's" administration. It
will ; not> s bear scrutiny. Its weakness, Its
waste.: its. blunders." Its defectsâ all have been
exploited and exposed to the Raze of the vic
timized lawyers and the outraged citizens of
the State. ' Governor Gage appointed that com
mission and a large proportion of its work,
occupying months, : and even years, and caus
ing the expenditure of large sums of public
money, has been overthrown by the deliberate
action ' of the ' Supreme Court, having been
found by that Â¦: body repugnant -to the con
stitution, f whose commands, requirements and
limitations careful lawyers are; supnosed to
know and be. guided by. Large; sums of the
people's money thus- expended were literally
thrown away in tinkering the Political Code.
And yet the same apprentice commission goes

yers might- have completed completed correct
ly, and without loss to the State, long ago
had openings been made on the commission
for men who knew their trade. â¢ No such op

Throughout Governor Gage's : administration

the scenes at Sacramento is to be found, al
ways, the malign presence of Dan Burns;

Leading Men: and Influential Newspapers That Supported

ONE TERM OF GAGE QUITE
ENOUGH FOR CALIFORNIANS
Mr. Harriman can hardly be ignorant of the results of that combination. Gage was
elected Governor only because the people were persuaded that he was not in alliance
with the railroad bosses. When he showed himself conspicuously as the ally of Herrin in
the fight to elect Burns to the United States Senate, the Republicans who had elected
him to office revolted and Burns, was beaten by a Republican Legislature. Later on
when the combination endeavored in this city to name the Mayor and the members of
the Board of Supervisors, the scheme was defeated by Republican votes cast for a*Demo
cratic candidate in one instance and for a labor candidate in another.
The mass of people of California, whether Republicans or Democrats, are not
There is not one single genuine interest of the railroad that is conserved by an
alliance with Gage, Burns,. Kelly, Crimmins, Lynch or Jere Burke. Mr. Herrin, who does
politics for the railroad, uses those men more for private gain than for the benefit of the
road. By their alliance he has been enabled to render himself so, useful' to the water com
pany and the street railway company as to obtain from them salaries as their attorney,
as well as the attorney of the railroad. He has been also able to obtain large fees in pri
vate practice by reason of his political pull. Â¦
The Southern Pacific Railroad cannot have any lasting interests that are ;; op-?
posed to the permanent interests of California, lit cannot be to the interests of the road
to support corrupt politicians, nor to back them in predatory raids .either . upon the
State or upon counties or municipalities. If Mr. Harriman undertake to^corrupt Cali
fornia politics the corruption will react upon his road. Evil begets evil. ' For a 1 long time
the Southern Pacific Company has antagonized tlie best people of both parties in Cali
fornia, and as a consequence there has been engendered on' the part ;of
the people that has seriously hampered its activities. The company has been compelled
to pay out many thousands of dollars to political "bosses and" their. gangs, which "could
have been retained in the treasury of the company had : the managers of the ' roads
allied themselves with theÂ»better elements of the people instead of resorting to corruption.
Mr. Harriman may have no aptitude for politics, nor any inclination for it, but as
president of ''the Southern Pacific Company it is; his duty to concern himself with tlie
political interests of his roads and 1 he manner in which they are managed. It .will* be
profitable to him and to his company to devote some portion of his stay on this coast^to
a study of those matters. The political interests of the. railroad in' this State have 1 been
woefully mismanaged to the detriment of the State and of the road, and the- people and : the
company have a right to expect of Mr. Harriman something in the way of reform. .
In the first place all will agree, with the statement that . railroad companies and
all other big interests should put themselves in a position to protect ;their_ political inter
ests. Jn fact whether men have big or little interests they should strive to hold; such a
position. It" is upon that principle our Government is based, and it)is just for the^ pur
pose of clothing every citizen with power to protect his interests that -he is -given the
franchise' and the right of free speech. Upon that phase of the .issue then : there, will be
no dispute, but now come the specific questions, What interests of the Southern Pacific
Railroad are at stake in the politics of California, and how can they be best protected?
As Mr.' Harriman is a candid talker, that statement may be accepted as a fair ex
pression of his views upon an issue of great importance to California and of, noiittle im
portance to himself and to his company. It is therefore a fit subject -for public comment
and it is but right Mr. Harriman should know what the public think of it.
E- H. HARRIMAN, in reply to, a question by a representative, of the press as to
what policy he had established for the Southern Pacific Company in regard to
participation in political arlairs in California; said: "I am not. a politician and
â¢ have no familiarity with political affairs. I haven't any aptitude nor the incli
nation for it. I will say this much, however, that I t believe railroad; companies, as well
as all other big interests, must of necessity' place themselves in a position to protect
their interests." â¢ .. 1 -.".Â¦Â¦-.'

BOY VAGBANT MAKES
DASH FOB LIBERTY
Spiro Racevich Escapes From Judge
Conlan's Court, but Is Re
captured.
Splro Racevich, a boy 16 years. of age,
who was arrested on a charge of vagran
cy, made a dash for liberty from Judge
Conlan's court yesterday morning, 'and
after a swift chase by Bailiff Michael
Walsh, one of the heaviest men on the
force, he was caught on the first floor "of
the Hall of Justice, just as he was open
ing the door leading into Kearny street.
The case had been called, and after
hearing the evidence of the arresting offi
cer the Judge granted a continuance to
hear the testimony of the boy's father.
The boy was standing close to the bench,
and, unobserved, walked half way toward
the entrance to the court room. Just
then Walsh noticed him and the boy made
a rush out of the court room. Walsh ran
out of the side door to head him oft, but
he had almost reached. the stairs -leading
to the first floor when Walsh saw him.
Walsh put on a desperate spurt and suc
ceeded in overtaking the boy. who waa de
layed by trying to open the door the
wrong way. . - .
Racevich was taken back to the court
room, and the Judge convicted him. on the
charge of vagrancy and sentenced him to
six months in the County Jail.
"William M. Zimmermann, professor of
German in the Polytechnic High School,
was on trial yesterday before- the Board
of Education on charges preferred by
Walter N. Bush, principal of the same
school. The charges include lack of dis
cipline and evident unfitness for teaching
on the part of Zimmermann, who consid
ered the situation serious enough to be
represented by counsel, in the person of
Attorney Stephen V. Costello, while Bush
was fortified by Attorney W. S. Brann.
There was an array of witnesses present
to give their testimony". These included a
number of associate teachers of Zimmer
mann, who had been called by. Principal
Bush to substantiate his charges.
Bush was the first witness to be exam
ined. He reiterated the allegations con
tained in his written charges filed with
the board and upon which the trial' was
ordered, after an unsuccessful appeal by
Zimmermann to the courts to prevent it.
Bush testified that the accused teacher
was unable to keep order among his pu
pils. There- was a constant shuffling - of
feet in the class and continual contra
dicting of the teacher, according to Bush.
"Whenever I heard any unusual noise,"
said Bush, "I knew it was in Zimmer
mann's room. I tried to support him in
securing discipline, but without success.
Other teachers had taught the class with
out any trouble." . \ Â¦ :
Bush's testimony was corroborated by
C. H. Ham. R. C. Daniels. J. B. C. Clarke
and A. G. Duffy, all teachers in the
school. Â¦ â¢ â¢ , Â¦ ,
Zimmermann, in his own defense, said
that while the discipline in his class was
not what it should have been, it .was. be
cause his principal had never supported
him and was not "from lack of ability on
his part. Bush , had frequently found
fault with him 'before his class, which
had tended to demoralize the pupils. Zim
mermann spoke of outings taken during
school hours by pupils and teachers, but
Bush explained that they had been taken
with permission of the former, president
of the board, Mrs. Klncaid. ' Professor
Elisha Brooks testified that Zimmer
mann's class in the Girls'V High School
was well conducted. The trial was then
declared closed and the board adjourned
until this morning to hear argument.

from the Independent Gas and Power
Company yesterday: .
Gentlemen: Information reached this com
pany yesterday that it was the intention of
the Board of. Public Works, which is composed
of you three gentlemen, to Institute a series
of wholesale arrests of employes of this com
pany upon charges of violation of the provi
sions of 'ordinance No. 2S8. ' - ' 'Â¦'
To-day five arrests have already been made.
This company, acting under the advice of
counsel, has at all times cheerfully and prompt
ly â¢ acquiesced andvtfbeyed every police regula
tion adopted with/ reference to the exercise of
Its constitutional franchise and does not and
has not sought to evade the same In any man
ner. â¢ It has controverted the power of tha
Board of Public Works to require a permit upon
the exercise of its constitutional right by this*
company, and it has also denied the right of
the board to levy a monetary charge upon the
exercise of such rights.
The last Auditor of the city and county of
San Francisco, acting upon the advice of emi
nent counsel, >. sustained the position of this
company. The Board of Public Works then
procured jthe arrest of an employe of the com
pany, the defendant was i acquitted, and our
pocitlon was sustained by the court. The pres
ent Auditor, acting- under the advice of.coun
sel, presumably, has again sustained the posi
tion of this company. A second prosecution,
instituted by your Â¦ board within the past two
months has resulted, after a very full argu
ment and presentation of authorities, in the
discharge of the defendant employe.
The communication was signed for the
company by General Manager A. M.
Hunt, c; Â¦
A case involving a similar question Is under
submission in the Supreme .Court of this State,
and the authorities quoted by counsel for the
company in the last, case have been submitted
to that court in a brief filed by permission as
amicus curiae. ,. The opinion Â¦ may be ' rendered
at any moment and would be a conclusive ex
position of the law upon thÂ« subject. V
Under these circumstances this company de
sires to enter its protest against the present
action taken by you gentlemen, as members of
the -Board of Public Works, and to call your
attention to the fact that in the opinion of this
company such action Is unjust and unfair. In
view of the series of adverse decisions. It seems
to the. officers, of this company that such ac

Judge Troutt accepted the resignation
of W. S. Goodfellow as executor of the
Fair estate yesterday. The resignation
was unaccompanied by any explanation,
and Mr._ Goodfellow would vouchsafe
none. Several days ago, when the news
of his, intended retirement was made pub
lic, Mr. Goodfellow said he resigned be
cause he could not see the need of three
executors and that James S. Angus and
Thomas G. Crothers could close up the
estate without his assistance. Further
than this he would not say, and he main
tained theBame silence concerning hl3
reasons for resigning yesterday. It is
said that the long legal battles indulged
in over the property of the late Senator
Fair caused him to tire of a trust, which,
when it first devolved upon him, promised
only honor and emoluments. Goodfellow's
fees as executor have amounted to $130,
000 since the assumption of his duties. Iij
connection with his resignation . Goodfel
low filed a supplemental account of his
stewardship from April 1 up to date. The
account shows that the receipts during
that time amounted to $63,530 73 and the
expenditures $784 50. ~

The problem of raising funds for thÂ«
purpose of. entertaining the grand officers
of and delegates to the Grand Parlor of
the Native Daughters of the Golden West,
which is to meet in this city next June, is
at present exciting the members of the
local parlors. A joint committee has this
matter in hand and there have been so
cial events and a day at the Chutes, but
sufficient funds have not been realized. At
a meeting of the committee last week at
which Grand Vice President E. D. Keith.
presided some members insisted that the
committee has the right to levy a tax or
assessment on the members of the sub
ordinate parlors and that if the tax is not
paid that the members can be deprived of
benefits.
In answer to a question upon the legal-
It of such a tax, the presiding; officer de
clared that the committee has no power
to levy any tax or assessment on the sub
ordinate parlors, but that It could ask
for voluntary contributions; further that
if such a . tax was levied its collection
could 'not be enforced; that a parlor
might vote to donate, so much per capita*
but that it was a matter for the parlors to
decide. It wis, nevertheless, .decided by
the committee to invite the parlors to levy
an assessment upon their members. Sev
eral parlors have already taken action
and voted down the proposition, notably
I>a Vespero and Orinda parlors. Regard
ins the proposed assessment the grand
vice president said:
"It is absurd to talk about the imposi
tion of an assessment by the joint com
mittee, for it; has not that power. I am
opposed unalterably to raisins funds by
compulsory /assessment in subordinate
parlors. The members have already been
heavily taxed for tickets tor the Chutes,
theaters, bazaar and so forth. I feel that
the parlors would make a voluntary con
tribution from the social fund for this
purpose. The Native Daughters feel soma
curiosity to know for what purpose the
money is to be expended before they maka
any donation, as no definite plan has yet
been announced. There seems to be a
strong feeling against any proposition
that will net be for the entertainment oÂ£
all."
Proposition to Levy Tax
to Raisfe Funds Is
the Cause.

Prof. Unna, Hamburg. Germany, Euro-
pean authority on skin diseases, says that
dandruff is as contagious as . any - other
malevolent disease, and that one. common
source of the spread of dandruff : is the
use of the same hair brush by different
persons. The way to avoid catching dan-
druff or any other disease- from another's
brush is to insist on the usÂ© of Newbro's
Herpicide. It not only kills the dandruff
germ, but it is also an antiseptic that will
prevent the catching of any disease what-
ever through contagion of â¢ another's
brush. .'':Â¦".Â¦Â¦

Officer Harris was called and said that
all the statements which Mrs. Heyer de
nied or did not remeber were made â¢ by
her. She positively- declared thatr-Heyei
had fired the Bhot at her and showed the
wrapper as evidence of the fact that stw
had a narrow escape. ' After, hearing Har
ris' testimony the case was continued till
Monday. Heyer is out on $1000 cash bail,
furnished by his wife. -
She sent, her maid to gat a policeman,
as she wanted her husband arrested so
that he would not annoy her. He was
arrested and after he was released , and
came home he struck her. She denied
.telling Officer Harris that the bullet had
gone through her wrappers and nearly
struck her. She did not say, ."There's the
dirty young pup who took-, a shot at me,
and I want to get- a divorce -from him. "
She did not think she- said, "I got a
divorce" from a banker in Chicago, who
was . a good man, . to marry that pup."
AfU< he had struck her on returning
home from prison she told: her maid to
telephone to the police station for the pa
trol wagon. | She did not think- about" the
black cat incident' at the time she spoke
to Officer Harris. â¢ . . = : -
, Mrs. Heyer. was put on the stand and
made a very unwilling â¢ witness, doing
everything she could apparently to shield
her husband. She staid she lived at 1116
Fell street. She had been married to
Heyer two months ago- in Chicago and
had been here three weeks. . On .Tuesday
night, while Wooldridge and Miss Fields
were in the dining-room, she and . her
husband, who was under the influence of
liquor, had a quarrel about a black cat
which was in the room, .and he said he
would shoot the cat. She, objected, and
then she heard the report of a shot. She
did, not see a revolver in her husband'3
hand. She did not know that the bullet
had gone through her Bilk wrapper. â¢
The case was continued till 2 o'clock
and Policeman G. B. Harris was handed
the attachments. At 2 o'clock Mrs. Heyer
appeared in court and looked as if she
had been suffering. Harris announced
that he had been unable to - find Wool
dridge or Miss Fields, and the Judge in
structed him to see that the attachments
were served upon them, as they had been
guilty of contempt of court.- The Jud-ge
had to wait for nearly I half an hour till
Attorney McConaghy, who , represented
Heyer.'made his appearance.
Mrs. Frances M. Heyer, who had her
young husband, Horace "H. Heyer, arrest
ed Tuesday night on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon, learned yesterday
from. Judge Mogan that the law cannot
be trifled with. When the case was called
yesterday morning neither Mrs. Heyer
nor the two Â¦witnesses subpenaed to be
present, W. . B. Wooldridge and : Miss
Emmie Fields, were In court. , Dr. Meyer3
told the Judge that Mrs. Heyer was sick
in bed, but the Judge was not convinced
and ordered attachments to be issued
against her/ and Wooldridge and Miss
Fields. . i

LONDON, April 18.â The Government
leader, A. J. Balfour, in the House of
Commons, to-day made the following im
portant statement f ..
"After two conferences between Lord
Mllner, the British High Commissioner in
South Africa, and Lord Kitchener and
the Boer delegates at Pretoria, Lord
Kitchener, .while refusing to grant an
armistice on military grounds, has agreed
to give facilities for the election and
meeting of representatives of the various
commands to consider the situation. The
Boer leaders have therefore left Pretoria
to carry out this plan."
Balfour admitted that- it was not'ex
pected that communication between v the
British authorities and he Boer leaders
could be resumed in less than three
weeks. .. . . . .Â¦
Balfour's statement made a generally
favorable . impression. It ' was . argued
among the members that the action of
the , Boer leaders demonstrates that at
any rate a majority of the delegates
favor the acceptance of the suggested
British peace terms. . Â¦
Â¦ The submission j of the question : to a
plebiscite of the burghers is according to
Boer law, which requires the leaders of
armed forces In the field to take the opin
ion of "their followers before concluding
peace. Â¦ .

THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR OF THE JURISDICTION OF CALIFORNIA
WHO WAS ELECTED YESTERDAY. ' .
LONDON, April 18.â During the course
of to-day's session of the select commit
tee of the House of Lords appointed to
inquire into the merits of the various
proposed railroad schemes for London the
opponents of some of Charles T. Yerkes'
plans objected to the introduction of
American capital, contending that all or
ders for the machinery and equipment
required for Yerkes' schemes were going
to the United States. Lord Knutsford, a
member of the committee, interposed and
remarked that the. committee did not
care whether the capital was American
or British, so long as the committee was
satisfied that the line would be properly
financed. .
American Capital Has Friends.
Shortly after the State began its case
in the District Court by serving the sum
mons and complaint on the Great Northern
Railroad Company, the Great Northern
Company, the Northern tSecuritles â¢ Com
pany and James J. Hill individually, the
attorneys for the Securities Company
ecrved notice on the Attorney General of
a motion to set aside the service of the
summons upon that company, which was
made upon Hill as president, on the
irround that Hill was not present in the
State as president of the Northern Securi
ties Company. â¢ i â¢
To-day, however, the attorneys for the
Securities Company decided to withdraw
this motion and waive the question of
service, and petitioned the District Court
for removal of the -case to the Federal
court. The grounds for this motion were
allegations that the suit Involved a con
struction of the Federal statutes and of
the constitution of the United States. This
motion Judge Otis granted. Attorney
General Douglas, when asked In regard to
the course that would now be pursued,
eaid: â¢
"I cannot say what action the State will
take until I have examined the papers in
the case. It is probable, however, that
the State will move to remand the case
back to the Ramsey County Court. Such
a motion can be made at any time upon
notice to the defendants. The original
complaint in the suit the State attempted
to bring in the Federal Supreme Court did
not allege violation of the Federal sta
tutes. I did not draw the complaint in
the present case, and do not remember
whether such a violation Is alleged or not.
If it Is, the Federal Circuit Court would
probably have jurisdiction' in the case.
We will probably move to remand the
case anyway."
ST. PAUL. April lS.-Judge Otis in the
Ramsey County District Court to-day
signed an order removing the action
brought by the State of Minnesota against
the so-called railroad merger to the
United States Circuit Coxrrt. The suit will
therefore have to be tried in the Federal
court, unless the latter sees fit to remand
it back to the State court.
LONDON, April 18.â The Rotterdam cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle says
he learns that the Queen mother will de
cline the regency because she wishes to
nurse her daughter, and that the Govern
ment will propose that Prince Henry be
come regent- for six months. ' 'Â«' ,
BERLIN, April 18.â The Cologne Ga
zette to-day revives the report of the
probable convocation of the Dutch States
General in order to establish a regency
in Holland on account of Queen Wilhel
mina's illness.
HETLOO, Holland. April 18, 7 p. m.â
Queen Wilhelmina's fever has not abated,
but the condition of the -royal patient is
said to be satisfactory. Her Majesty's
physlc/ans are said to be less anxious, as
it is believed the malady will not assume
the ordinary malignant character. Queen
Wilheimina is visited by her doctors three
times a day. She is supposed to have con
tracted her illness as the result of a
chill. Among the cable messages received
at the palace to-day Inquiring about the
Queen's progress was one from President
Roosevelt. . . â¢ .
The gates of Castle Loo have been
placarded - with a notification reading,
"Typhoid fever within.',' This was Tin
compliance with the Dutch law requiring
every house in which a case of contagious
disease exists to post a notice to that ef
fect outside. ;';. . " . Â¦ '. ; . ..
It has not been discovered where her
Majesty contracted the disease. It is de
clared that while the. water supplied to
the castle is good, the Queen has been in
the habit of drinking sterilized milk. Â¦ ,
"The supposition entertained by the
Queen's physicians since the commence
ment 0^ her Majesty's illness has become
a certainty. It is now established that
the Queen is suffering from typhoid fever.
Up to the present time the malady has
rim its ordinary course."
The question of establishing a regency
is being earnestly considered by Tiie
Netherlands Government, and it is
thought probable in view of the possibly
long-continued Illness of the Queen that
the States General (Parliament) will ? be
summoned In joint session at an, early
date to take action in the matter. i
THE HAGUE; April IS.â An official bul
letin was issued this morning from Castle
Loo stating that Queen Wilhelraina.
passed a fairly quiet night. The alarming
fever which complicated the Queen's con
dition is now officially admitted. to be ty
phoid. A special edition of the Official
Journal this morning publishes the doc
tor's statement, as follows: Â¦
LONDON, April. 18.â The voyage from
New York of the German ' imperial yacht
Meteor III, which anchored on* Hythe, in
Southampton water, yesterday .evening,
was by no means uneventful. She had
much bad weather, "and once even the
safety V, of the yacht was endangered.
Lieutenant Commander Karp'f, Emperor
William's representative on board the
Meteor, said: .
{â¢ "On April 11. while we. were towing, a
hard easterly blow sprang tip. -Owing to
I the heavy seas our consort, the steamer
i Scotia, was only just able to keep steer
! ing way. The seas broke i over her con-
I- tiniially. At 4 o'clock in the morning of
April 12 Â¦ the Meteor's bobstay carried
away. - We. cut away the tow rope, hove
to and tried hard to secure the bowsprit,
but we found that to.be impossible, and
the bowsprit was -ultimately carried
! away, seriously endangering the safety
of the yacht and all on board of her. we
managed, however, to recover the spar.
The weather became so bad that we were
j obliged to heave to for twenty-four hours.
! Thereafter the weather v was generally
'Â¦ fine. We towed the rest of the way to
| port. The Meteor behaved splendidly and
remained dry throughout the bad weath-
I er. She is a fast sailer." : :
Scurvy, and: typhoid fever are devasta
ting , the peasantry j throughout the , whole
of the Altai (highlands,- of -Siberia) region,
formerly the chief granary of Siberia.
The starving people there have consumed
even the last, remnants of their seed
grain, and no spring ; crops have been
sown. ' The last wheat sole! in Altai
fetched 2%' rubles * per 'Â¦ pood,,: against
the normal price of sixteen to twenty ko 7 
pecks per pood. In some places the scar
city of fodder is so great that half the
houses. have been unthatched to save the
lives of the cattle and horses.. . 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦ ;
The gravity of the situation is -evi
denced by. the latest statistics. - At j Men
zelisk,- Government of Kufa, there have
been upward of 4000 cases of typhus; at
Belibeisky, 682 cases have been reported,,
and at Akmolllnsk over '1900 cases have
occurred.. -Similar reports, come from
Vero'nej; Kasan and Saratoff;
The Red Cross Society is furnishing all
the aid at its command; in the way of

TATtTE'S CIXEBY COMPOUND.
PAlKlELERY
COMPOUND '
Permanently Cures All the
Varied Forms of
Rheumatism.
It Purifies the Biood and
Removes Every Trace
of Poisonous Acid.
The Great Medicine Has Cured More
Rheumatic Sufferers Than All
Other Combined Remedies.
Sufferers from the varied forms of rheu-
matismâarticular, muscular, inflamma-
tory â lumbago and gout should bear in
mind that there is a morbid principle In
the blood when rheumatism is present.
This morbid principle is uric acid, which
circulates with the blood and acts upon
the joints and muscles, causing the pains
and agonies of rheumatism. Palne'a Cel-
! ery Compound Is the only scientific rem-
i edy for the permanent banishment of
every form of rheumatism. If your Joints
are painful; If the knees', wrists, elbows
or .ankles are swollen a few bottles of
Paloe's Celery Compound will soon re-
move all your troubles and pains. If you
have Inflammatory or sciatica rheuma-
tism accompanied with fever, acute, dart-
ing pains in the sciatic nerve from the
hip down the leg, Paine's - Celery Com-
pound taken at once will soon drive out
the disease and make you strong and
active.
At this particular time, when rheuma-
tism frequently lays the foundation for'
other Incurable and grave troubles, we
specially urge the honest use of at least
one bottle of Dr. Phelps' life-giving medi-
cine. Paine's Celery Compound. No case
is too complicated or difficult for this king
of medicines. Thousands of happy and
grateful men and women sing its praises
and continually recommend It. It is tha
only medicine that can rescue people from
agony and death after physicians pro-
nounce them incurable. Mrs. Louisa FJ.x,
Wesley, Iowa, 'says:
"Some time ago my husband was taken
down with inflammatory rheumatism, so
that he was unable to get out of bed
alone or to dress himself. We employed
gocd doctors and used many kinds of
medicines, but with no relief. We .finally
sent for a bottle of Paine's Celery Com-
pound, and before he had finished it he
v.-as able to be at work. Another bottle
entirely cured him."

have squeezed the shorts.

Morgan & Co. and explained the situa
tion, intimating that the pool was ready
to sell out to the bankers at a reasonable
profit. The bankers realized the serious
ness of the case and invited August Bel
mont, chairman of the Louisville and
Nashville board of directors, to attend a
conference.
"You have got controlâ there Is no doubt
about that," Belmont is said to have re
marked to Gates,, "and I guess there is no
doubt about somebody being badly cor
nered from the' looks of things.
"Perhaps the gentleman does not know
whom he has caught short. I am not
short and never have been. That $5.000.tOO
of new stock was sold for the company.

ald of this city admit that they have, In
combination with W. A. Bissell, pur
chased the street railroad system â¢ of
Stockton. They say that the purchase
was made for themselves and that they
are not acting for any other company or
syndicate. Despite the fact that Bissell
is connected with the Santa Fe Railroad,
the purchase, they say, has nothing to do
with that corporation. William- G. . Hen
ehaw is the president of the Union Sav

nected with all" of the railroad deals of

was a large stockholder in the Oakland
Transit Company, ahd it was through him
that the transit company finally, secured
possession of the Haywards* system, that
gave the transit company 'complete con
trol of the Oakland railroads, so that
Henshaw is no stranger to these railroad
deals. ' Macdonald is well known in rail
road and financial circles* He secured
the rights of way for the Santa Fe from
Stockton to Point Richmond, and has
been intimately connected with many of
the big deals at Point Richmond
In company with Henshaw, Macdonald
secured a series of franchises from Point
Richmond "to the. Alameda County line
which franchises are now in the posses

Macdonald said in regard to.the pur
chase: . ..â¢â¢..
"The purchase of the Stockton street
railroad system has been made purely as
an investment. We are acting entirely for
ourselves, and no corporation or syndi
cate has anything to do with it. Stockton
is a growing city. It stands at the head
of water navigation, has a large and
very -wealthy agricultural country and a
rich mining -country tributary to it and
my associates and myself believe that it

rows, chief of the bureau of the non-

ured at the University of California this
afternoon on the problems of ethnology in
the Philippines. He described from an
ethnological standpoint the races in the
Philippines and told where they were to
be found In the various East India Isl
ands.
In speaking of the "true Malay." the
leading race of the islands, Dr. Barrows
eaid:
The Malay is not a diminishing race. It is
increasing. It is full of virility, ambition and
ability to progress. It has a future I believe
emong the races of the world. The mission of
the United States in the Philippines, if it seems
to have one at all, is to overcome the race
prejudice and misunderstanding: which exist
between the Malays and the white race. This
frreat undertaking must be accomplished in
order to insure peace and tranquillity between
thera.

There is nothing In hla business affairs with

We have not seen Mr. Salisbury since last
Tuenday.' He had complained of being ill on
Monday, which waa collection day. After
the bank closed I told him to go home. Tues
day he was on hand, but waa still complaining
of illness, so we sent him home.
Mr. Salisbury had been In our employ for
four years. There 1* nothing: wrong with his
accounts. X know that, for I have looked over

That suicide had been in the man's

Salisbury's employers say they are as
much in the dark concerning the cause of
their bookkeeper's death as Is his wife.
After being notified that Salisbury had
ended his life under peculiar circum

She did not exhibit great surprise- al
though later she declared she could not
find any cause for his act.

Administration of Estate Is Made
Easier by Compromise â Spring
Valley Again Suffers.
OAKLAND, April 18.â In accordance
with the compromise recently entered
into between the heirs, the will of the
late Arthur W. Jee, the wealthy Incom
petent, who died recently, was admitted
to probate to-day in Judge Ellsworth's
court. By the terms of the compromise
W. F. Barton, who Is executor of the
will, and Percy H. Coward, executor of a
codicil that is disputed, stepped aside and
permitted t*he Public Administrator to be
administrator of the estate. Now if the
heirs named in the will want to contest
Coward's claim they can. otherwise the
probate will go ahead. Â¦
The Epring Valley Water Works was
the sufferer again to-day in a legal dis
pute over technicalities in Judge Greene's
court, where Mrs. John R. Clough is pros
ecuting a suit against the corporation for
Nlles Canyon water rights. Its demurrer,
motion to strike out and motion to sepa

ty flays to answer and put in Its case.
The rights of apprentices are involved
in a suit that has just been decided in
Judge Stetson's court. Hiram Donaldson
sued the Oakland Iron Works for $19
wages. The defendants claim that he
was under agreement with them to serve
out an apprenticeship and that he broke
the contract when he quit without notice.
Judge Stetson decided in favor of the
plaintiff. The case will be appealed.
Judge Ellsworth appointed Flora Pan

she sank continually and remained deli
rious to the end. The flag at the univer
sity was lowered to-day to half-mast In
respect to her memory.
Miss Garland had a' record as a bright
student and a hard* worker. As a mem
ber of the college of letters she was con
tinually poring 6ver the ancient classics,
and to this constant mental effort is cred
ited the breaking down. of her brain and
her final death. While here she lived
with Mrs. C. E. Atkinson at 2316 Allston
way. When her Illness first came upon her
she became bo violent that other students
residing In the same place were compelled
to hold her. She was sent to the sanita
rium with the thought that her Insanity
would leave her as soon as her mind wa3
free from her studies.
Miss Garland was the daughter of R. H.
Garland of Redlands. She would have
graduated next month but for her fatal
illness. The body will be shipped to Red
lands for interment.
AETHTTB, W. JEE'S WILL
IS ADMITTED TO PROBATE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, April 18.
By giving his wife $3000 John Simonds,
the eaw manufacturer, puts a chasm be
tween himself andÂ»her forever and ends
aU the talk that has been going on ever
since she began suit against him a while
ago for maintenance.
The terms of the agreement are made
public in a document that was filed to-day
in the County Recorder's office. She
agrees to relinquish all claims to further
alimony and possession of their former
home at 2412* Channing way, Berkeley, in
consideration of $aÂ»0 that he gives her.
She waives all present and future rights
end both agre3 to go their ways, never to
cross each other's path again.
The Simondses were married four years
ago in San Francisco after she had come
ail the way across the continent in re
eponse to his proposal. He was her fourth
husoand.
They soon began to disagree. She didn't
like California and he didn't like her son,
whom he characterized as "the star
boarder." Finally he left home and com
pelled her to sue him for maintenance.
Mrs. Simonds came out ahead in her
suit. He lost his temper on the stand in
Judge Halls court while trying to prove
that hers was irascible. That counted
against him with the Judge, who ordered
him to pay her JT5 a month and let her
live in their unhappy home for the rest ol
her days.
To this penalty Simonds objected and
threatened to get a new trial, if he could.
The prospect for more notoriety was so
abhorrent to the wife that she capitulated
â¢when overtures for a settlement were
made.

N. O. Nelson,' founder of a Utopian
town in Illinois, Â¦; just across ;', the Missis
sippi River from St. ;; Louis, ; was given a
dinner \ by the Ruskin Club this evening
at' the Hotel Metrdpole. ; : Mr. Nelson is
here on a visit that mixes pleasured with
business and as he is an out-and-out So
cialist he is being received by socialistic
bodies wherever , he goes. . "-v/-. ? -
While the dinner was given in his.honor
there were other prominent guests pre.s
ent, among .them Mayor Schmitz of San
Francisco, the Rev. B. Fay Mills, the Rev.
George Fuller Professor Walter T.: Mills,
Robert S. Knight, John Henry Dickman
Jr.,, Joshua P. Garlick.M. ,V. Roark, Ar
thur C. Gutterson, and. Herman Lesser.;
The round-table after the dessert was
led by A. A; Dennison on the subject
'"Spots on the Urn."... The. origin and cure
of existing social evils were elaborately
analyzed, Mr. Nelson, Mayor Schmitz and
the other guests entering enthusiastically
into the spirit of the discussion.' After
dinner Mr. Nelson was invited â¢ to- talk
about trades unionism and the capitalist.
His auditors thought he) was going to in
clude a description of Le Claire,"the'Illi
nois -town- that he is responsible for, but
he didn't say a word about it.
He might have told how Le Claire Is a
place of unmixed happiness, where the
people live in almost perfect equality and
share In the government and profit-shar
ing of their employer, but he left that all
for next Sunday evening when he will
address the congregation of the First
Unitarian Church on the subject. . ,
'Â¦ "Thee trades union movement," he said,
"while general and beneficial, is not the
ultimate end of this fight for social re
form by any means. My experience with
trades unionists and also my observation
is that they don't make unreasonable de
mands and that eventually : socialization
in the means of manufacture and distri
bution will be the result of their pioneer
ing.
"In regard to the New Zealand plan of
arbitration I think some of the provisions
are a littje harsh,' but these will adjust
themselves after a while. It is my opin
ion that trades unions are a form of co
operation. \Ve had to have them before
we could come to a realizing sense^of the
strength that lies in unification.
,"As an employer of labor I have seen a
great deal to convince me that there are
irreconcilable differences between the em
ployer and employe. I don't think these
can ever be fully bridged, but it seems
to me that there must be some way by
which the breach can be kept narrow.
.This will come through a more ready
sympathy between the two conditions and
the co-operation that -socialism wÂ»rks
for." â¢
Mayor Schmitz said that he could not
see how it was possible to wholly elimin
ate capital as a force in the world. He
believed it to be necessary to make- the
world go round. He advised the working
men to stand together. ....â¢
"The greatest enemy of the working
man." he said, "Is the political bossâ the
political demagogueâ and you. want, to
Bteer clear of him if you ever, hope to reg
ulate capital."

ent were Austin Lewis, Jack London,

ested. He hired the room at the Arling
ton at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, going
there almost directly from hla home.
Nothing was found upon his person that
would throw light on the cause of the
suicide. Only a few private letters and
tome pocket odds and ends were brought
to light- by Deputy Coroner Quellen, who
removed the body to the Morgue.
The dead accountant was in the real
estate business In San Francisco befora
going to the Everdlngs. He had been re
garded by some as eccentric and waa of
a highly nervous temperament. Several
vears ago, while driving a buggy in San

POSTUM CEBEAL.
SWEET BREATH
When Coffee Is Left Off.
A test was made to find if just the
leaving off of coffee alone would produce
ar. equal condition of health as when cof-
fee is left off and Postum Food Coffee
used in it* place.
A man from Clinton, WIs.. made the ex- !
periment. He says: "About a year ago I
left off drinking coffee and tea and .began
to use Postum. For several years pre-
vious my system had been in wretched
condition. I always had a thickly furred,
bilious tongue and foul breath often ac-
* companied with severe headaches. I was
troubled all the time with chronic con-
stipation so that I was morose In dispo-
sition and almost discouraged.
"At the end of the first week after
making the change from coffee to Pos-
tum I witnessed a marvelous change in
myself. My once coated tongue cleared
off, my email appetite Increased, breath
became sweet and the headaches ceased
entirely. One tning I wish to state em-
phatically, you have in Postum a virgin
remedy for constipation, for I certainly
had about the worst case ever known
among mortals, and I am completely
cured of It I feel in every way like a
new person.
"During the last summer I concluded
that I would experiment to; see if the
Postum kept me In good shape or whether
I had got well from Just leaving off
coffee. So I quit Postum for -quite a
time and drank cov-oa and water. I found
out. before two weeks were past, that
something was wrong, and I began to get
costive as of old. It was evident the
liver was not working properly," so I be-
came convinced It was not the avoidance
of coffee alone that cured me, t but, the
great value came from, the regular use

Dr. George T. Brady and Dr. George

Bide had five or Elx men to assist In thÂ»ir

Kenny were as positive that the two doc
tors had from five to eight men who wera
concealed in the bushes. William Mc-
Nevin said there must have been thaz
number because every time he shot out
his good right hand some one bit the
dust. Dr. Chase took upon himself to
cross-examine the opposite side, but he
Â¦was not a success, and several times ha
had to be called to order by the Judge.
There was a desire on both sides to
keep Mrs. Gertrude Piper from belns

ordeaL Although the Judge, in dismiss-
Ing the cases, asked for a suspension of
hostilities, both sides eyed each other in
Buch a manner as to lead to the belief
that his advice would not be heeded if the
occasion offers.
Judge Cabanlss, after listening to the
stories told by the opposing forces at the
battle In Union Square Monday night, ad
vised them to cease hostilities In the
future and dismissed the charges of bat
tery against Harry and William McNevin

"It is known that a mild stimulant well
diluted with, Apollinaris was drunk by
Queen Victoria, under the advice of her
physician, Sir William Jenner, and now
we even find the London Times, ceremoni
ously stating in its column of news about
royalty that the Apollinaris Company has
been appointed purveyors of natural min
eral water to. the King and to the Prince
of Wales. Between this association with
royalty and. the worth of the water it Is
easy, to understand why on nearly every
table in London hotels a bottle of Apol
linaris can be seen as an accompaniment
to the meal, but the special point is that
the glass of ordinary water with ice is not
asked for or served." ~ s^.
A well known Fifth-avenue Hotel man'
says: "We Americans" have not yet fully
overcome the pernicious ice water habit,
for many people here still expect that a
glass with ordinary water almost filled,
with ice be served to them at once. Or
dinary water to fbe palatable must., be
served too cold to be healthful, while a
wholesome effervescent table .water. on'
account of its carbonic acid gas is ra
freshing even , If served without Ice, so
long a? It be cool. It is, however, already
noticeable that Â¦ Americans, particularly
those who have traveled much, are more
and more acquiring the preferable Apol
linaris habit, although they have not yet
fully reached the same stage as our Brit
ish friends. - . - - . -
No Ice Water for Royalty.
Although the San Pedro had ten passen
gers aboard, none of them knew of the
accident until they awoke this morning.
In spite v of a heavy tarpaulin that was
speedily rigged over the San Pedro's
shattered bow she made water rapidly,
and the engine-room fires were soon ex
tinguished. The Noyo took her in tow
and brought her to port. In order to
lighten the strain on the twisted hull
1,400,000 shingles were Jettisoned.
First Mate Anderson was on the bridge
of the Noyo, which left here on Thurs
day for Fort Bragg, when the accident
occurred. He did not see the San Pedro
he said, on account of the Noyo's fore
sail being set. He heard her whistle and
answered it, but what he did after that
he declines to discuss beyond saying that
he knew something was going to -happen.
Captain Johnson, who was in his bunk
at the time, passes up his interest In the
occurrence to the local inspectors of hulls
and boilers. I . ' ,
"Let Bolles and 'Bulger find out." he
says.
We left Eureka at 7 o'clock Thursday morn-
Ing. All went well until about 12:50 this
morning, when about thirty-fiVe miles north
west of Point Reyes we saw a light about two
miles ahead. The night was inclined to be
misty, but was clear enough for purposes of
navigation. Hedwell, the second mate, was on
the bridge with me. As we approached the
light I blew one whistle and put my wheel to
port. The Xoyo answered my whistle, put her
wheel to starboard and ran plumb Into us.
That's all I have to say about It.
The San Pedro was the greater sufferer.
She was struck on the port side of the
bow, her stem was taken clean out of her
and her planking was started to an
alarming extent. Had she not been load
ed with lumber nothing could have saved
her from a rapid trip to the bottom.
Captain Jahnsen of the San Pedro tells
of the accident as follows:
WITH thirty-five miles of water
on one side and the width of
the Pacific Ocean on oth
er, the steam schooners San
Pedro and Noyo ran Into each
other early yesterday morning, head on.
A watertight bulkhead prevented ths
Noyo from sinking and a load of lumber
buoyed up the San Pedro. The San Pedro
arrived yesterday afternoon in tow of the
Noyo. ' â¢
Captain Jahnsen of the San Pedro
places the blame on the Noyo.
Captain Johnson c* the Noyo said, "Let
Bolles and Bulger find out."

Miss ! Olive 'â¢Catharine Longabaugh,* a
trained . nurse.'X residing at 791 Hayes
street, is named as legatee of the late Ed
ward R. Swain in the will of the de
ceaiBe'd,', which was filed for probate yes
terday. It is a peculiar will, in that it cuts
off the Swain family from any share of
the estate, with_the exception of a legacy
of $1 each to the two brothers of the tes
tator, . F. A. Â¦ and . Charles Swain, one of
whom resides in this city and the other In
New York. It is probable,' however, .that
Miss Longabaugh will never receive the
legacy, as the will is Invalid in that it is
not entirely holographic, it being written
on a_letternead of fa wain's,-" the" date lino
being printed thereon. Many decisions of
the Supreme Court have declared that
holographic wills .not- "entirely" in the
handwriting, of a testator are invalid.
Miss Longabaugh, it is said, was engaged
to be married to Swain for several months
prior to his death. He was ill for several
months at. the residence of her sister. Dr.
Emily j Hartman, before his removal to
Lane's " Hospital. She accompanied â¢ him
to the hospital and nursed him until his
death' occurred on the 10th lnst. Swain's
estate is estimated to be worth "more
than $10,000." His architect's library, at
his office in the Crocker building, and the
office fixtures, he leaves to G. .R. Ward,
a lifelong friend, and to \V. E\ Pinkham,
his business associate, he leaves the fix
tures of his office in Honolulu. V -
Harry D. LovelaAd expressed the senti
ments of the gathering when he said that
the merchants of San Francisco were glad
cf an opportunity to show to the people
of the interior towns and cities that they
have the warm sympathy of San Fran
cisco.
Charles Bundschu. Leopold Michels, H.
D. Loveland. Andrea Sbarboro, T. C
Friedlander. Walter M. Castle. Rufus P.
Jennings. J. A. Filcher, I* P. Currier and
J. D. Grant took part in discussing the
several features cf the excursion. In the
original plan It was arranged that the
party should go to Bakersneld by .the
Santa Fe and return by the Southern
Pacific line. Some of the business men
thought that It would be better to start
by the Southern Pacific and return ths
ether way. On motion of T. C Fried
lander it was voted that all further ar
rangements shali be left to the sub-com
mittees of the general committee, with
power to act.
At least one hundred business men will
make the trip. The invitations will be
confined to the business community. Very
likely the number of excursionists will far
exceed one hundred. The minimum is
one hundred. Every excursionist will pay
his own expenses. The committee on ar
rangements has not finally concluded its
understanding with the , railroad people
but there will be unquestionably a very
low rate, which will include the charge
for the sleeper. v
The Saa Francisco business men who
are going to visit the Bakersfield carnival
*nd street fair next month may go down
in a decorated special train with a brass
band, waving banners and placards bear
ing messages of good cheer to the entire
San Joaquin Valley. Such was the sug
gestion made by Charles Bundschu of the
Merchants' Association at a meeting'
which was held yesterday in the hall of
the Chamber of Commerce. Joseph D.
Grant presided at the deliberations, Tjhich
attracted representatives of about every'
line of trade in the city. A report was
submitted by the committee on arrange
ments concerning a proposed itinerary.
When this ccme to be discussed it was
epeedily made clear that the general de
slre was to visit as many clues of the
Ban Joaquin \ alley en route as possible
in the time allotted. To accomplish this
the report was referred back to the com
mittee to fix the matter up finally and
definitely.
So far as already decided upon by the
committee the special train will leave
San Francisco on the evening of Thurs
day. May is, at 9 o'clock, and will run
directly through to Bakerslieid, arriving
there at 7 o'clock the following morning.
The Etay in Bakersneld will last until 4
a., m., Jsatuiday, May 10. Then the spe
cial train will ctart on the homeward run
and it is arranged that Fresno shall be
reached at noon Saturday. The torenoon
of that day will be devoted to visiting
Visalia., Kanford and Tulare, the purpose
being to call upon the business men of !
the valley at their own business centers.
From Fresno the trip to San Francisco
will not Â«be continuous. A stop will be
made at Madera. Tnat is all that is dell
citely decided at present. The spirit of
good fellowship will be cultivated all
along the line.

STOCK MARKET.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April IS.â The varied activity
of very large speculative forces was still mani
fest in the stock market to-day. The move
ment of prices was entirely characteristic of
an active speculative movement under a well
centered and aggressive leadership. The deal
ings were on a larger scale than those of yes
terday and progress was made also In the
Â¦ bi-eadth of the movement and the variety of the
stocks dealt In. The average of the dally deal- '
ings for the ifeek has been brought up to im
pressive proportions and, in fact, to a level bt .
t-uft ained activity that was . entirely unprece
dented In the local stock market until last
year's new records were established during the
period or greatest speculative excitement. There Â¦
was nothing In the news to-day or in the con
ditions Â«r outlook to account for the manner
Jn which new points of strength were con
stantly developed, while the older points of
strength were left to drift downward or | were
subjected to Judicious feeding of the demand
for the purpose of realizing profits. Those
flocks which spurted late in the day yesterday
"icd those which opened this morning with . a
vigorous upward movement almost without ex
ception -were subjected to realizing to-day and
closed the day with small net gains below the
b*rt' prices. Thli was notably true of Atchlson
&nd the anthracite coalers and was measurably
true of etocks which showed periods of strength
later In the day. Broadly sneaking the leader
ship of the advance was shifted. to St. Paul and
then the Union Pacifies, with a more moderate
response among the other Southwestems and
Pacifies. Southern Railway and Louisville and
Nashville fell Into the background again. The
bituminous coal carriers enjoyed a - period of
strength and there were a number or wide
advances among scattered industrials and'upe
cialtiee. Colorado Fuel was active and strong
en speculative supposition that absorption of
that company into the United States Steel Cor
poration had been assured aÂ« part of the set
tlement of the control of Louisville and Nash

CHICAGO, -April 18.â There was not such a
volume of business " in ~ wheat as for several
days past. The crowd was in a guessing frame
of mind and .feared possible rain news might
cause a break at any moment. There was any
quantity of bullish news, but under . the pre
vailing sentiment much was lost sight of and
the trade seemed deaf to anything but rain
possibilities. The condition, as one expert . put
It, is one of dry ness from Pennsylvania to
Texas and north to the North Dakota line. The
trade understands well what can happen if rain
does not. fall. The extreme of the dry ness cen
ters in Kansas. At the opening there was a
short-lived spurt. May prices started %@%c
up at 74%@74%c. Prices were somewhat 'er
ratic In their fluctuations, dipping frequently,
and then as frequently rallying, - though . the
rallies were weaker each time. There was a
rumor of rainfalls West and profit-taking and
some short selling pressed until May Â¦ closed
weak. %@%c lower at 73%@73%c
Trade in corn was inclined toward. the wait-
Ing attitude. > Business was moderately active
at times. The close was weak, May %c down
at '62c:- - ' ,
Oats had a fairly good trade, though wheat
and corn dragged â¢ it down. May closed
down ' at 43c. '
Provisions looked like a manipulated Â¦ market
to-day. ' Though trade was quiet, /prices early
were strong. The hog market was only steady
and may have contributed to a growing .weak
ness, but prices were depressed by ' the local
bears. May pork closed 12%c lower; lard 2%o
down and ribs 2%Â®5c lower.

Kansas City reports that even with favorable
weather from now on not over half a crop is
possible In the .Southwest. The Modern Miller
says that damage' reports are increasing and
there has not been enough rain. R. G. Dun &
Co. issue a wheat statement in which they
say the outlook is encouraging for a large yield
of winter wheat, the least satisfactory feature
being the lack of moisture, which Is causing
arxiety In a number of States. Bradstreet's
gives th* exports Â¦ of wheat and flour for the
week at 4,118,000 bushels. At the close of the
day It was raining hard in St. Louis and'sev

Weather conditions have been potent for good
during the past week. .-.- Retail distribution was
greatly accelerated, .' which > In turn enlarged
jobbing j trade and brought ' : more pressure on
manufacturers " for prompt shipment;, agricult
ural work was facilitated -and building opera
tions made rapid â¢ progress ; traffic . increased at
the interior as the condition of < country, roads
improved, which made collections better. Some
labor controversies were, settled and others
were averted. Complaints are still heard re
garding,. tardy deliveries, but : freight is- less
congested and business has increased to the
extent of 6.9 per cent, larger railroad earnings

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL
complain of a shrinkage, but this if the natu
ral result ot the change of weather for the
past week. British Columbia Is increasing- her
shipments of household coal, hence there . Is . a
relative decrease of demand for Australian
domestic grades, although there are several
cargoes now en route, suitable for that pur
pose. Freights on ccal . from Australia still
remain depressed, evidencing that outward,
grain freights from there are ruling: low. aa
our. local outward grain freights are anything
but seductive. Fuel Oil Is being sold in larÂ«Â»
quantities, still there is no perceptible im
provement in quotations; It is still being:
offered, at very low flgures, notwithstanding
consumers can well afford to pay much higher
for it. An extraordinary demand has recently
developed itself for screenings and slack for
steam, as it is low-priced and very effective:
for the moment all the yards are without any
on hand. As only house coals' are screened,
the quantity made is not large, steam coals
are never screened. The large deliveries here
this week from British Columbia will relieve
the market and will cause some of it to go Into
yard."

PERSONA!/.
Ganswindt. who was originally a lawyer
and then a farmer, had been experiment
ing for ten years with various visionary
inventions, none of which practically
realized his expectations.
The police had long suspected Gans
windt and detectives had been working on
the case for five months. He recently of
fered to the War Minister for 20,000,000
marks a flying machine which, he said,
would reach the planet Mars. The pris
oner also claimed to have invented a
motor paving multiplying power*, result
ing in a sort of perpetual motion.
Ganswindt recently flooded the papers
here with immense advertisements of fly-
Ing machines, containing the indorsements
of clergymen and other persons inexperi
enced in business, from all parts of Ger
many. It transpires that some of the
names were forged, including the name of?
Duke Ernst Guenther of Schleswlg-Hol
stein, Emperor William's brother-in-law.
BERLIN, April 18.â Hermann Gans
windt, whese so-called flying machine has
attracted wide attention, here and abroad,
was arrested to-day for deception, forgery
and gulling the public into subscribing for
shares of an aeroplane company. He had
obtained money In small sums from, hun
dreds of people.
The Philippine bill was laid aside and a
bill . was passed appropriating $25,000 to
establish a fish hatchery and fish station
in Utah. The Senate then passed flfty
flve private pension bills and, after a
brief executive session, at 4:53 p. m.'ad
journed.
Bawlins, a member of the Philippine
Committee, offered a substitute for cer
tain sections of the measure relating' to
the government of the islands, the**<Jpera
tions of the courts and extending to the
Philippines the land laws of the United
States. He also offered, on behalf of the
minority, a substitute for the entire meas
ure, granting, from the restoration of
peace in the archipelago, independence to
the Filipinos, and providing for the for
mation of a constitutional government in
the Philippines.
Carmack offered two amendments, one
providing that no person or corporation
should hold . persons in slavery in the
islands or should enploy persons held in
slavery, under penalty of a fine of not
less than $10,000; and the other declaring
that the United States regards with ex
treme disfavor the admission of the
Philippine Islands as a State of this
Union.
The reading of the measure was con
cluded at 5:50. p. m., aU of the committee
amendments being agreed to with the un
derstanding that all parts of the bill
should be subject to amendment.
WASHINGTON, April 18.-At to-day's
session of the Senate consideration was
begun of the bill temporarily to provide
a form of government for the Philippine
Islands. The measure was read and the
committee- amendments were agreed to
tentatively, but no action was taken.

a solemnly ludicrous lot of advice to magazine

FOR the fourth time Company D of
the League of the Cross Cadets
won the prize in the annual com
petitive drill, which was held
Dimmick went into minute details as to
the system employed at the Mint of
counting the gold stored in the vaults. He
said that the sacks of gold stored In the
pigeonholes around the walls of the vault
were frequently concealed by piles of gold
on trucks or in heaps on the floor. When
the vaults were in this overladened con
dition so that all of the money could nat
be seen it was counted by assumption
that is, the sacks in the pigeonholes
were eupposed to be in place.
The defendant described at great length
all the events that occurred both imme
diately before and on the day that it was
discovered that the bags of double
eagles were missing. He entered so ex
tensively Into detail at this point that the
court had to request that he confine him
self more to the matter at issue. Collins
told the court that he desired his client to
make a clean breast of everything so that
It might be seen that he was acting just
â¢as an innocent man would act and that
he was holding back nothing.
Dimmick had not finished his testimony
when the court adjourned at 5 o'clock
He will again resume the stand on Mon
day morning.
In regard to his duties Dimmick testi
fied that Superintendent Leach had in
structed him to keep a close watch on
Cole so that if anything should go wrong
he would be able to reprimand the
cashier. One of his duties in this respect
was to count the gold in the vaults at
the close of each day. After three or four
months, Dimmick said. Cole objected to
his counting the cash, saying that he
could look after his own business and
Dimmick should confine himself to his
own affairs.
Dimmick testified that Leach requested
him to assist Cole in changing the com
bination of the vault. Continuing the
witness said he took off the back plate of
the upper combination lock and gave Cole
the necessary instructions written on a
slip of paper. Cole made up the combina
tion and found that it would not work.
Then Dimmick came to the rescue with a
lead pencil in his hand and had Cole work
the dial. Cole failed a second time. Then
â¢ It became necessary to take off the dust
plate and line up the tumblers with the
lead pencil. Cole failed again and the
matter was let ' go until the next day,
â¢when Cole succeeded in getting his new
combination to -work. Dimmick did not
know then and never knew what num
bers Â¦were selected by Cole for his com
bination. He also denied positively that
he had ascertained from the back of the
lock the numbers selected by Cole. Ete
denied equally as positively that he had
*ver made any marks on the mechanism
of the vault locks.
Says He Was Told to Watch Cole.
When the defendant Dimmick was
called to tne stand by his attorney there
was a perceptible stir of Interest in the
courtroom. Although half a year has
elapsed since the disappearance of the
coin he was able to repeat the exact
words of every conversation addresse.l to
him at that time. Not only this, but he
described the places where the conversa
tions were held and the events leading up
to them.
The court admitted that the prosecution
had tailed to prove that the lock was out
of order before, July, but he declined to
order the testimony stricken out, declar
ing that the jury should determine how
far it should oe used.
Jury Will Determine Facts.
A mild sensation was sprung in the
morning by Attorney Cxeorge L>. Collins,
when he made a motion to strike out
from the record the testimony given by
J. 1*. Bergen, John F. Young, Charles Â£'.
"Waltz anu Aorian rtyan. i'heir testi
mony had been offered to show that tne
Iock. on tne vault was out of order after
the shortage had been discovered in July,
1SW1. Collins argued to have this testi
mony cxpungea on the grouna that it was
incompetent, irrelevant ana immaterial,
nothing having been adduced to prove
that tue lock was out of order precious
to the theft.
During the entire time that Dimmick
occupied the stand, and he was there cur
ing almost the entire day, not once did he
display the least confusion or hesitancy
in answering any quesUon propounded by
Attorney Collins. Those who had come
vith the expectation of witnessing any
mclodranilc outbreaks or embarrassing
responses on the part of the defendant,
were disappointed.
As on the preceding day the defense
again attempted to cast suspicion on
Cashier Cole. Dimmick asserted that
Cole objected to the removal of the gold
irom the overcrowded vault just previous
to the time that the empty pigeonholes
were discovered.
Walter N. DImmick. the defendant i
whom the United States Government is j
trying its utmost to convict on the charge
that he stole $30,000 in gold from one of '
ils most substantial vaults, took the wit
ness stand yesterday in his own behalf, j
Nothing that has not been told and re
told again and again was developed, but j
the interest of the spectators was kepc at j
lever heat by the thorough and most cir
cumstantial manner in which Dimmick
exploited the details connected with the
disappearance of the sacks of coin. |
. "I : have ; tried my best â¢ to ,.-. prevent a
strike, while knowing all the time that
.the men were perfectly Justified. Mr. Vin
ing's attitude has not been conciliatory
at all. He has not conceded anything to
the men since this strike agitation began.
I urged him* through â¢ his superior, â¢ Mr.
Duane, to quit discharging men until alf
the disquiet . caused by the recent ex
change of the street car lines had been ad-
: "I had the promise' of the '-committee
that called on me this afternoon," he said,
"that they would not order a strike unless
it was absolutely necessary. I am sorry
that circumstances forced them j to take
this action, as it means a great amount of
suffering and loss to the men and the
families depending upon their Â¦ labor for
their daily, bread.- v Â¦ .. . .
Â¦ Mayor Schmitz was surprised when told
that the street car men had decided to go
out on a. strike. Â¦ ... . â¢ Â¦
Schmitz Blames . Vining.
President Cornelius stated that the
strike had the sanction of. the â¢ Interna
tional Union of- Streetcar Employes.
jSaid that a telegram had been sent to
"President W. . D." Mahon of. the Interna
tional Union, explaining the situation and
that he was satisfied that the strike
should be ordered. Cornelius further an
nounced that : President Mahon was now
on his way to this day to assist tne
streetcar men in winning their fight
The following telegram explains the
character, of President Mahon's informa
tion: Â¦
OWOSSO, Mich., April" IS.â W. D. Mahon of
Detroit, president of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation of " i Street I Railway Employes of
America, who is in. this city visiting- friends,
to-night received a telegram from one of the
leaders In San Francisco stating that a strike
of .the street railway men had been ordered tj
take . rilace .to-morrow morning and that 3000
men would be Involved. -
President Cornelius and Financial Sec
retary Dingwall stated last night that the
exact time for striking could not be an
nounced, as it was the desire of the union
'â¢to hit the companies as hard as possible
and not to give them the least time to
prepare." The' executive committee
seemed to be- of 'the opinion that if the
hour of strike should be made public the
companies might succeed in intimidating
the members of the -Union and thus frus
trate the plans in the very inception. -
President Cornelius estimates that the
number of. men that would Join in tne
fight would aggregate about 2000, but the
other officers of the union were in no
wise so confident that . the strike call
would be obeyed by so many. In fact the
whole plans for the strike seem to be ex
ceedingly vague and Incomplete. While
it wa!s decided not to inform the street
car employes last night President Corne
lius. Financial Secretary Dingwall, and
Henry Johnson, a member of the execu
tive committee, were cither unable or un
willing to say how the men were to.be
called out. They also were unprepared
to say whether the : cars of the com
panies were to- . be abandoned In the
streets and left to take care of them
selves or whether they - were to be run
Into the carhouses and there consigned to
an enforced rest.
Help From. the East.
At the meeting last night of the San
Francisco Labor Council, with, which Di
vision . No. 205, Amalgamated Association
of Street Railway Employes, is affiliated,
the question of a strike of the â¢ streetcar
men -was not even considered. The union
was not represented at its meeting by the
delegates. Two weeks ago the Labor
Council refused to indorse the proposed
strike. 1
Strike Not Discussed.
. Those among the owners and managers
of' the -lines who are most familiar with
the situation say there will be no strike,
the union not being strong enough in
membership to affect seriously the opera r
tion of any line of the street car system
of the city. Manager Vining. Superintend
ent Reynolds of the Sutter-street line and
others say that it is not possible for Cor
nelius and his associates to cause" tho
employes to leave their posts. ;Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢â¢ ;
No meeting of the union was held, and
the' decision to order a strike was reached
at a short conferenc^of four, or five lead
ers in the organization of - the union held
at the . Turk-street Temple during the
afternoon, after Manager Vining of the
Market-street lines had declined to see
them or to consider their demands and
after Mayor Schmitz had told them that
he could : do " nothing more in the way of
mediation.
Cornelius declined to state the exact
hour at which the men would be asked to
â¢leave the cars or how they would be noti
fied, as that would forewarn the employ
ers. \ He said that it was hoped that 2U00
men would quit work, but that the leaders
did not expect to be able to tie up the
street car system of the city immediately.
Richard Cornelius, president of the
Street * Railway 'Â¦':Â¦'â¢ Employes'. Union, an
nounced last night that a strike would be
ordered to r day on. all the lines of San
Francisco excepting those of the Califor
nia-street Railroad Company. This action
was decided upon, by the executive com
mittee of the union after Manager Vining
refused to reply to the committee's writ
ten demands, a . . ;
