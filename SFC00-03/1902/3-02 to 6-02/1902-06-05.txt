Sergeant Edwards, who Inflicted the tor
tures referred to, has' been ordered before
a court martial, and the case againsf
Lieutenant Arnold is being further Investi
gated.
Captain Parker West, who made an in
vestigation, reported that three soldiers
corroborated what Weir said about the
treatment of prisoners. Captain West
concluded his report as follows: "I believe
that a thorough Investigation into the
matter will substantiate the charges made
by Private Weir that prisoners were treat
ed in a cruel manner and that Lieutenant
Arnold winked at this treatment."
Another charge Is that Lieutenant Ar
nold directed that the man be immersed
in a creek until he was unconscious.
Weir concluded his charges with the fol
lowing statement: "Men of the troop
have told us that they have known Ar
nold to have a man tied to the saddle of
a horse. A few feet of slack was allowed.
A soldier was then mounted on the horse
and told to gallop down the road for a
mile and back. If the prisoner could run
as fast as the horse, It was all well, but
if he could not, he had to drag. Arnold
had had this done several times and more
than once the prisoner was dragged."

a square inch of the man's body was left

then thrown across a beam, the man was
strung up by the thumbs, another rope

from under him. While up he was

Police officers from Huntington to-day
identified Hanson as one of two men who
had held up W. W. Erwin last night in
Huntington. After the hold-up the men
had a pitched battle with the officers, in
which one was wounded in the shoulder.
The other highwayman is thought to have
died from wounds somewhere in the hills
near Huntington.
SALT LAKE, Utah, June 4.â A special

inflicted by a man who attempted to hold
him up two miles from Weiser.

S. A. Campbell, who is named as one of
the defendants, is collector of the port
of Eureka, and figured prominently in the
recent sensational exposures Involving
members of the city council and which
have resulted in a series of libel suits.
According to the statements made by
the defendants, Thompson's term as re
ceiver expired early in the year and he
sought a reappointment. A bitter fight
was made against him, and the conduct
of the receiver's office during his incum
bency was attacked. They allege that

was to place his resignation in the hands
of some disinterested third person, to be
delivered to Bull as soon -as his reap
pointment were made. The resignation
was made out in favor of the younger
Bull. According to this arrangement, the
document was duly drawn up and signed.
Receiver Thompson alleges without
equivocation that the resignation was not
freely given, that it was obtained from
him by fraudulent methods, and for that
reason he repudiates it.
Back of this action there is an interest-
Ing political story. The ground on which
the injunction is sought is that the res
ignation was procured through duress and
coercion. On the other hand, the defend
ants named in the application for a re
straining order declare that the resigna
tion was freely made and delivered Into
the hands of Monroe, former city attor
ney of Eureka, to be delivered to Bull,
who is chairman of the Republican Coun
ty Central Committee.
EUREKA, June 4.â After a lull of two

the Democrats with much of the infor
mation with which they have combated
the Philippine bill. Since the charges
Â¦which Senator Culberson so long endeav

have at last leaked out, they are more
1 renounced in their intimation to this ef
fect, as shown -in Senator Beveridge's
insistent query as to whether or not
General Miles gave out the information.
Captain Parker West is at preser.t in
Washington, and declares that he had no
idea of how Senator Culberson obtained
the information which he read on the
floor of the Senate. This leaves only
General Miles to be heard. He has as
yet not been reached by the department,
end consequently his answer Is, not
known. He will probably arrive in Wash
ington in a day or two.
Judge Advocate General Davis made a
similar statement. He was positive that
the charges had not been given out by
sny one in his division of the War De
lias-tment.
General Corbin reported to Acting Sec
retary Sanger to-day that the informa
tion had not leaked out in his depart
ment.
PASSED UP TO MILES.
The charges filed by Private Weir fol
lowed the course of all such papers. The
document passed through four depart
ments. Captain Parker West, inspector
general of the Department of Luzon, to
whom the charges were presented in the
Philippines and who partially investigated
them, forwarded them to the office of vhe
adjutant general in this city. They were
then sent to the office of General Miles,
and General Miles, in turn, referred them
to General Davis, judge advocate general,
for action, and finally they were received
by the Secretary of War, where they
went into the files.

President Mitchell was kept busy all
day at his headquarters. He had nothing
to say regarding his visit to Scranton last
night where he met Frank P. Sargent
Chief of the Locomotive Firemen. Re
garding the general strike situation he
said everything was progressing satisfac
torily; that more men were coming out
each day and that the idle' men are be
having themselves well. The national
president had no comment to make when
informed that the New York Board of
Trade had decided to ask President Roose
velt to take up the task' of trying to end
the great struggle. .
It was comparatively quiet today in the
Wyoming valley. There was the usual
gathering of crowds at several collieries
at starting and stopping time, but nothing
of a serious nature occurred. Some men
were stoned on their way to and from
work and several were thrown into podls
of water. The fear of bodily harm is
causing more men to quit work than are
the arguments of the strikers.
There was a slight fire in the town to
day and as the fire alarm is sounded by
means of the colliery whistle, there was
much trouble and delay before the volun
teer company could be called to the scene
of the fire. The company, it Is said, will
allow its mines to fill with water and let
the borough get its water supply as best
it can.
The Susquehanna Coal Company's col
liery No. 5 z.t Nanticoke was forced to
shut down its engines, all the firemen re
fusing to go to work. This company fur
nishes the power for the water supply cf
Nanticoke and unless the engines are
again started the borough will have a wa
ter famine to contend with.
FAMINE OF WATER.
A correspondent was informed by a
mining official who has positive informa
tion on the subject that most of the mines
in the Schuylkill region are accumulating
water. The Reading Company's collieries
located in that region are the chief suf
ferers. The collieries of the Lehlgh Val
ley Company and Individual companies In
the same territory are also slowly filling.
In the Hazleton, Wilkesbarre and Scran
tor, districts the condition is not so bad,
only one mine here and there showing
water.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., June 4.â More
engineers, firemen and pump runners
obeyed the call of the Miners' Union and
struck to-day, but in most instances the
coal company's officials were able to fill
the places of the strikers.

tecting an arbitration of the differences
between the miners and operators. It is
said that 'the President has not decided
what action he will take in response to
the suggestion.
PRESIDENT CONSIDERS.
"Anthracite coal as a fuel," the resolu
tion said, "has become a prime necessity
of life and industry, and the threatened
scarcity caused by the controversy has
resulted in a large advance in price and
great hardship and injury to all con
sumers. A larger advance in price ' is
Imminent and will follow if the differ
ences * between the railroads and their
employes in the mines are not speedily
adjusted."
James offered resolutions which recited
the fact that more than 100,000 men are
now out.
At a regular meeting of the New York

Because of this it is deemed expedient
by Mrs. Emily Runyon Earl to see how
much weight the clergyman's words and
actions carry in the exclusive set. Ac
ceptances to the 500 invitations she has
sent out for the entertainment to-morrow
night in the Hotel Angelus will tell the
tale, and doubtles3 will convey to the
Christ Church pastor, a significant hint
that his sentiment on divorces and his
decision concerning divorcees are not
final.
Rev.- Mr. Dowling officiated at the mar
riage of Edwin J. Earl, the millionaire
fruit man and newspaper owner. There
fore, It is argued by syne, tho Rev. Mr.
Ijowling, by this action, practically made
it appear that, whatever was the cause
of the divorce of Edwin J. Earl and
Emily Runyon Earl, the husband was
the innocent principal.
Not long ago the Rev. George Thomas
Dowling of Christ Episcopal Church in
a symposium on the subject, "Divorce,"
paid thai he would never consent to mar
iy a divorced person unless ha were con
vinced that the person was the innocent
party to the divorce suit. â¢ ---.,Â¦ - ,~

FORT DE FRANCE," Martinique. June
4. S a. m.â Professor Angelo Heilprin,
president of the Philadelphia Geographic
al Society, who is here for the National
Geographical Society, came into Fort Oe
France last night from his explorations
of the crater on the summit of Mont
Pelee. The following important points
have been settled by Professor Hcilprin*
The location of the new crater has been
accurately detrmind. It is positively
known that there has been no overflow of
molten matter from the lip of the crater.
There has been no subsidence Â¦ of the
mountain and the height of Mont Pelee
is unchanged. The crater does not con
tain a cinder cone, there has been no
oatuclysm and no topographical altera
tion of the country. Tnte period of violent
eruptions has probably ended, although
the volcano may continue to be quite ac
tive for a long time to come.
Referring to his expedition Professor
Heilprin said to-day:
' "May 31 we made our ascent of the vol
cano. The party consisted of Mr. Led
better.and myself and three colored boys.
We were on muieback. At an altitude of
700 meters we began the ascent of the
airete. We passed along its east side and
slightly to the north of the mountain. We
arrived at the lip of the old crater and
former site of Lake Palmistfe at 11 o'clock.
Here it began raining. Rain clouds and
the clouds from the volcano enveloped us
and we could not see ten feet. A terrific
thunderstorm had begun and we sat on
the edge of the crater for borne time, spec
ulating whether the detonations we heard
were of thunder or from the volcano.
River Runs Boiling.
"As we afterward found the river Fal
laise to be boiling, the detonations were
probably volcanic. We could not tell how
near we were to the crater, as either from
local attraction or the electric conditions
our compass refused to work. Its vari
ation was about twenty degrees to the
eastward, but later we found that it acted
normally at the lip of the crater. We
finally groped our way down that awful
airete through gloomy clouds of rain and
amid great electric discharges. At every
step were dislodged the rain-soaked ashes
and we were in danger of being precipi
tated into the hideous gorges on either
side.
"The extreme top of the volcano is cov
ered with ashes, scoria, boulders and an
gular rocks, which had been ejected from
the crater. Further down the mountain
is covered with ashes and mud, and these
are thick on the airete. On our way
down we saw the river Fallaise rushing
along with great velocity, and full of
steam and mud.
"At Acier we met George Kennan and
his party and determined to attempt. a
second ascent the next day, June 1. The
ascent made this day with Kennan was
more trying and difficult than the one I
bad previously made with Ledbetter. The
day was intensely hot and it w r as raining.
When we reached the old crater it was
again enveloped in vapor. The tempera
ture of the basin of Lake Pa'miste, taken
three inches below the surface, was 124
degrees Fahrenheit. Between rifts in the
clouds or vapor we could see the crater.
Suddenly the vapor cleared away and we
made a dash forward. We reached the
edge of the new crater and from where
we stood we could have dropped stones
into the white hot mass within.
THE NEW CRATER.
"The new crater is a crevasse running
north and south and expanding into a
bowl. This crevasse Â¦ nearly rifted the',
mountain. It runs transversely to:the oldÂ£
crater and might be called Â¦ a huge gap. :
From it volcanic material had been freely j
erupted. * ;
"As we stood off the edge of the crater
a sublime spectacle began. I have some
conception of what is going on Inside the
earth, and have been a spectator of na
ture's secret interior works. We were as
sailed with noise. Far below there was a
hissing of steam like that of a thousand
locomotives, as well as violent detona
tions. The principal output of the crater
while we were there was steam. The phe
nomenon was limited and. was not essen
tially different from those of other vol
canoes in action. Positive assurance was
gained that no molten matter has flowed
over the lip of the new crater. Several
observations taken with the aneroid bar
ometer showed that the height of Mont
Pelee has not changed.

LOUIS SLOSS, PROMINENT COMMERCIAL MAN
WHO DIED EARLY THIS MORNING AT HIS
HOME IN SAN RAFAEL. ., . . , -,
Last evening a reception was tendered
to the grand officers and delegates in the
social hall of the Alcazar Building The-e
were about 300 present, and after a gen
eral introduction there was a programme
o". music and vaudeville numbers between
dances. The contributors were Tracie
Margo, Master Margo < and Miss Peck,
Miss Wesser and little Gladys Cordy
During the noon recess New Century
Circle gave a sumptuous lunch to its dele
gates, â¢ Mesdames Zelssing, Beversen,
Lemme and Drendel. To this were invited
all the grand officers and an hour was
spent at tne festal board. There were no
speeches and the only unusual event was
the presentation by Companion Mrs. Wil
kins of a bunch of flowers to. each of thÂ«
delegates.
To-night there will be a banquet to the
officers and delegates.
At the last held session a committee
was appointed to prepare a set of resolu
tions thanking Companion Ernest C.
Stock for personal. services to the order.
Yesterday the chairman of the committee,
Mrs. Emma A. Harrington, announced
that after due consideration it had been
decided to substitute for the proposed res
olutions something that might be more
useful, and then, on behalf of the Grand
Circle, she presented to the companion a
set of silver backed brushes, appropriately
engraved and every piece bearing his
monogram.
A law. was adopted authorizing a small
per capita tax to provide entertainment
for grand officers and delegates, i
There was also taken up the report of
the special committee appointed at the
previous session to revise the constitu
tion.* Eighty -eight changes were recom
mended and nearly all were" adopted, the
majority being to rub off rough edges in
the construction of sentences.
BEVISION OF CONSTITUTION.
In the afternoon the rest of the report
was read and the reports of the other of
ficers were presented and referred, to
gether with that of the grand chief, to
the committee on distribution.
The report of Grand Representative Mrs.
L. Atwdod, who returned to this city as
supreme subchlef companion, -was also
presented and read, after which that of
ficial was escorted out of the room and re
turned for presentation to the grand body
as a supreme officer, when she was re
ceived with the honor due her rank. She
gracefully acknowledged the compliment.
She recommends that circles instituted
within sixty days of the meeting of the
Grand Circle be allowed delegates in the
grand body; that the office of the grand
financial secretary be located in this city;
that to prevent wholesale withdrawals
from circles no more than six withdrawal
cards be granted during any one month;
that the work of organization be contin
ued; that there be no reduction of the
per capita tax; that the Grand Circle pro
vide for the entertainment of delegates
and grand officers at" Grand Circle ses
sions; that, the order establish boards of
relief; that an instituting officer be al
lowed a reasonable sum to meet inci
dental expenses incurred in the work )t
organizing; that a funeral fund be cre
ated; that boards of ~ deputies be estab
lished; that Memorial day be properly ob
served in all circles, and that the official
organ be encouraged;
The. grand chief pays a compliment to
The Call for notices of the doings of the
order, and also makes special mention of
the American Foresters' Review, the of
ficial organ, for notices and timely sug
gestions.
MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS.
, From this document it appears that the
order prospered during the last v year, 1134
new members ;haying been initiated, but
there was a loss of a considerable-num
ber by reason qt suspensions for non-pay
ment of dues. The grand officer suggests
that the various circles of the order as
certain the cause^of each suspension, not
nWely that the member has not paid
dues, but the exact reason for non-pay-c
ment, and report the. r.ame to the execu
tive-council. During her term she paid
official visits to twenty-four of the forty
five-circles,-.the other circles being of
ficially visited by Grand Sub-Chief Mrs.
H. Worms, Grand Treasurer "Mrs. Kemp
Van Ee, Grajid Recording Secretary Mrs.
L. Atwood, Grand Inner Guard Mrs. S. E.
Ellis and Past. Grand Chief Companion
Mrs. ~ Emma i A. Harrington. During the
term three new -'circles were instituted,
one at Vallejo,. one at Oakland and one at
Soledad. One circle at Nevada City and
one at Chico were reinstated. " *
All the delegates and the grand officers
.were^present at roll call, and after these
had, been seated the morning sessiou wa3
taken up in the reading of the minutes
of the previous session at the request of
one: of the delegates, and a reading of a
part of the report of the grand chief com
panion, a most exhaustive "document.
Â¦ The' fifteenth annual session of the Com
panions of the Forest of America opened
in .Foresters' Hall,, in the Alcazar build
ing, yesterday morning, with Grand Chief
Companion Miss Alice Ticoulet in ; the
chair.
At the last meeting of the push County
Committee Burns and Kellj^ Joining
forces, defeated the Herrin and Crlmmins
candidate for secretary and elected Clif
ford McClellan. There is a rumor in politi
cal circles that Crimmlns has captured a
few of the Burns men, with the assistance
of Herrin and Lynch, and will endavor
at the next meeting to oust Burns' man
McClellan and put in Pat Prendergast,
who was defeated at the former meeting
Burns is said to be so thoroughly dis
gusted with the whole machine fight
that he will not interfere to protect the
works. It is doubtful if the committee
can develop sufficient strength to organ
ize one district club under the immedi
ate auspices of the so-called governing
body of the local Republicans. It would
surely be a piece of folly for the Election
Commission to recognize this boss-cov
ered relic of the last campaign as the
legal governing body of the party in San
Francisco.
"The powers of the government of the
State of California shall be divided into
three separate departmentsâ the legisla
tive, executive and judicial; and no per
son charged with the exercise of powers
properly belonging to one of these depart
ments shall exercise any functions ap
pertaining to either of the others, except
as in this constitution expressly directed
or permitted."
It 5s no idle prophecy to assert that the
rext Legislature will order an investiga
tion of San Quentin prison, and if the
Governor, whoever he may be, attempts to
interfere in the legislative department to
stifle the inquiry the people will be heard
from. The next time a Governor attempts
to bluff the Legislature he will be called.
Section 1, article III, of- the constitution,
is still operative. It reads:
The Legislature wisely sought to pro
tect the taxpayers of the State in trans
actions bearing upon the investment at
State funds in county bonds and there
fore passed a bill providing that the State
Treasurer should be consulted. Gage,
perhaps fancying that the measure re
flected on the financial integrity of him
eelf and the Honorable Daniel Kevane.
objected to the bill. The result of his ob
jection is obvious. A majority of State
Senators at first believed that the tax
payers would be benefited if a committee
of five hold-over members of the Senate
Fhould look into Aguirre's management
of San Quentin prison. Gage did not care
to have the Aguirre method of prison
mar.ageme-nt investigated. The âfearless"
Governor fought the proposition to In
vestigate. The result of his opposition Is
now obvious.
Signals of distress, are flying In the
camp of the bosses. The push politicians
are wondering what will happen next.
Their only remaining hope is that Gage
will emerge from the cloud of scandal
caused by the suspicious Kern County
fcnnd purchase and the shameful manage
ment of San Quentin prison affairs. The
Governor at last accounts was at San
Quentin investigating. The people de
nj&r.d investigation. It is now generally
regretted throughout the State that Sen
ator Belshaw's resolution providing for a
committee of five hold-over Senators to
Investigate the prisons during the recess
of the Senate was not allowed to stand.
Governor Gage interfered in the work of
the legislative branch of the State gov
ernment and insisted that the resolution
should be rescinded and the Senate did
v&te to rescind.

How to buy furniture
and carpets
without ready
money
o- .
We will loan you the money for a regular banking
rate of interest â six per cent. And you can pay us
back little by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the. first-class furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big, and fresh and where satisfaction is certain, and
when you have made your selection you can pay your
bill in full with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
and being compelled to select your goods from smaller
and 'inferior stocks? y
The installment stores charge you ten per cent
above their cash prices when you ask for long credit.
All you pay us is six per cent
Fcr example: If your purchases amount to $100.00
we will charge you $106.00â which is a six per cent
advance: then you pay us $20.00 cash and the balance
. in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month.
If your purchases amount to $75.00 we will charge you
$/9-53; you. make us a cash payment on this of $15.00
and pay the balance at the easy rate of $6.45 .per
month.
You save four per cent. You have the great privi-
lege of buying in a first-class store, and yet you get
all the advantages of the easy payment plan as offered
" ., by the installment houses!
No amount of money is too small for us to loan.
Worth looking into, don't you think?

Lord Kitchener's address to the Boer
delegates at Vereeniging, in which the
commander in chief said that if he had
been one of them he would have been
proud to have done so well in the field as
they had done, made the best possible
impression/ and drew forth a hearty re
sponse from General Beyers, the chair
man of the Boer conference, who ex
pressed the pleasure the Boers expe
rienced at meeting Lord Kitchener as a
friend, adding that they had fought so
long against him that they had acquired
full appreciation of his worth.
The departure of the Boer commanders
from Vereeniging for their various dis
tricts was marked by remarkable scenes
of fraternization. The trains conveying
the Boers started late, and the night be
ing extremely cold the -sentries along the
railroad track lighted huge bonfires,
around which groups of Boers and Brit
ons gathered, forming a highly pictur
esque scene. The late opponents joined in
such songs as "Hard Times Come Again
No More" and "Old Folks at Home," the
British soldiers and the burghers outvy
ing one another in demonstrations of Joy.
In brief, the scenes' at the departure of
the trains resembled nothing so much as
the starting of huge picnic parties.

The ballot of the Boers at Vereenlgirg
resulted In 554 votes in favor of surrender
and six against it. The Boer delegates,

are returning to their commandoes In or

PRETORIA, June 4.â Generals Botha
and Delarey and other Boer leaders will
start for Europe' shortly for the purpose
of raising funds for theÂ»distressed burgh
ers. General Schalk-Burger, who was act
ing president of the Transvaal, joined
General Botha in addressing an open let
ter to the burghers. After referring to
the courage which they had displayed and
to their brave deeds in the field he called
on them to work together for the social
and spiritual advancement of the country.
General Botha remarked relative to the
termination of the war:
"It is the happiest day of my life since
I left school." c
The Boers do not anticipate the least
difficulty in bringing in the various com
mandoes. The work of returning the men
to their wives, children and farms will,
however, be heavy and difficult. It is im
possible to send them straight to the veldt.
It is absolutely necessary, at this time
of the year, to have warm shelter, and
wooden huts have already been ocdered
from Cape Town to be delivered in sec
tions for each family. Those who are un
able to return to their former avocations
will be temporarily supported by the Gov
ernment.
APPEAL FOB BOERS.
In the House of Commons the Govern
ment leader, A. J. Balfour, presented a
message from Â«King Edward as follows:
"His Majesty, the King, in considera
tion of the eminent services rendered by
Lord Kitchener and being desirous In
recognition of such service to confer on
him some signal mark of his favor, recom
mends that he, the King, should be en
abled to grant Lord Kitchener Â£50,000."
John Dillon, William Redmond and
Swift McNelll, Irish Nationalists, an
nounced their intention of opposing the
grant at every stage. A resolution re
plying to his Majesty's message will be
discussed to-morrow.
Almost all the morning newspapers In
London comment upon the grant of Â£a0,
000 to Lord Kitchener a3 unnecessariÂ»y
niggardly. The report that Kitchener will
come home for the coronation Is Incorrect.
He still has much to do in South Africa
and it is not likely that he will leave there
before the middle of July. The South
African commands will then be diveded.

Santa Rosa's Council Will Revoke the
Franchise of the Central
Company.
SANTA ROSA, June 4.â The franchise
end right- to use the streets of this city
which are at present traversed by the
Central Street Railway Company Is about
to be revoked by the Common Council.
At the meeting last night an ordinance
was Introduced by Councilman King and
passed its first reading declaring that
the company had forfeited its franchise
and that the railway lines are nuisances.
The action by the j Council Is said to
have been taken because the company
which controls the railways allowed the
roadbed to get below the official grade of
the streets and refused to keep It In
repair; also because flat rails were
not supplied and a regular time schedule
was not 'kept. The ordinance will be
given a second reading and final passage
at the meeting of the Council on
Juno 17.
The president of the company, J. H.
Brush, has announced his intention to
appear before the Common Council and
confer with It. He expresses surprise > at
the action taken and claims the company
has expended much money in an endea
vor to keep the property up to the re
quired standard.
COURT'S RULHTG GOES .
AGAINST THE STATE
Indications That AH Coyote Scalp
Claims Will Have to
Be Paid.
SACRAMENIO, June 4â Present Indi
cations are that all holders of Â¦ coyote
scalp certificates, assigned or' otherwise,
, who have instituted proceedings against
the State, will obtain judgments In the
Superior Court for- the amounts sued for.
For the past three days the question as
to whether the certificates for scalps
should be admitted in evidence has been
argued before the court, and this, after
noon a ruling was made by Judge Joseph
W. Hughes admitting them in . evidence.
In concluding, his ruling Judge Â§ Hughes
said: ;â¢ ' "> Â¦ 'â¢';Â¦Â¦ ' Â¦ . .
I reach this conclusion reluctantly, becauso
I believe that it will deny unto the State the
right to nrove that there was perjury hi mak
ing the affidavits suggested in the act, or that
some other fraud was practiced upon the board.
I feel that these certificates are proof of tha
killing- of the coyote . by the- party named In
the certificate; that he killed tae number there.
In stated, and that there Is /due to him the
amount therein stated,- and such certificate will
be admitted in evidence. ~
L.OS AXGELES. June 4. â Denial was mado
to-<iay of the Ftatement that Henry E. Hunt
lrsrton ha<i obtained an option to purchase the
J^os AncelÂ«?s Traction Company's street rail
road property.
One trunk among the scanty furniture of
the miserable room held the secret to the
woman's identity and a hint as to the pos
sible cause of her terrible deed.- A mar
riage certificate issued at Oakland In May,
1899, disclosed that as Mrs. Jennie Caldwell
she had been united in marriage to An
drew Jensen by the Rev. J. F. Sutherland
WAS TWICE MARRIED.
mother. The tip of the gas Jet was found
at the foot of the bed, where it had evi
dently been tossed. The keyhole and the
space between the bottom of the door and
the lintel had been, stuffed with rags to
prevent the escape of gas. There was no
note or word of farewell from the dis
heartened woman who had deliberately
planned to end her life and to take her
child with her into the unsolved beyond.
Every indication pointed to a deliberate
murder and suicide on the part of the
WEARY of life's buffeting, des
titue and probably the victim
of a romance the outcome of
which had ended In somber
disillusionment, Mrs. Jennie
Jensen turned on the gas in her room at
505% Mission street Tuesday night and
lay down upon the bed beside her sleep-
Ing child. When other lodgers broke into
the room at 11 o'clock yesterday morning
both bodies were cold in death.^ The
daughter, a pretty girl of thirteen, was
undressed and under the coverlets, but
the mother had laid down fully dressed to
await death.
In conclusion the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer said one of the first matters to
be considered was to determine how the
revenues derived from the mineral wealth
of the Transvaal could be allotted so as
to provide interest on a portion of the
war debt.
The Chancellor had grounds for hoping
that in the course of a few months large
garrisons in South Africa would prove un
necessary. He was glad to say he could
dispense with the additional Â£15,750,000
which he had asked for when the new
loan was authorized by the. House. He
said he proposed to continue the new
taxes for the present, but hÂ© asks the
House to resume the sinking fund as the
best step toward re-establishing the credit
of the countrv.
The Chancellor said that the whole
Â£10,000,000 provided for in the budget for
the prosecution of the war would be
needed to effect the demobilization and
the transportation of the British troops
in South Africa; to move the Boer fam
ilies from the various concentration camps
and to furnish garrison for South Africa.
Reviewing the necessities of the situa
tion, now that the South African war Is
terminated, he said that the new taxes,
including the duty on grain, would be re
tained in order to raise the money re
quired, but if there is any surplus it will
be devoted to the redemption of part of
the national debt.
LOXDOX, June 4.â In the House of
Commons to-night the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
made his promised financial statement.
Hicks-Beach Makes His
Promised Financial
Statement.
The track was clear at 10 o'clock, the
Fteam crane, worked by Sacramento and
Dunsnruir crews, lifting the half-demol
ished engines and tender bodily out of the
crut. The bodies of White and Van Tas
pell were brought to Redding and Coron
Â«r Green and a jury found that death was
due to a wreck willfully caused by un
known persons.
Engineer White was 45 years of age
and rated as one of the most careful men
on the road. His body was taken to
Dunsmulr to-night to his widow and three
children. Fireman Van Tassel was 25
years old. He had a brother on a San
Francisco carline and another in Los An
geles. Efforts to reach them by wire have
proved futile.
Had the train been late It would have
l>een going at 50 miles an hour at this
point and many more must have been
killed.
Detective William Ahern, who came
from Sacramento with the wrecking train,
made a critical examination before be
ginning his work.
The switch lock was in place. The bolt
In the switch rod had been removed and
lay ten feet up the track, where the
wreckers had thrown it. The bolt nut
could not be found. The switch had been
pried open just slightly and the jar of
the first engine opened it wide for the
second one to take the siding.
Conductor Depangher ran forward,
climbed over the great pile of wrecked
machinery which blocked the track and
threw his light under the tender and
there beneath the twisted iron lay Engin
eer White, Squarely upon him was
pinned the crushed and lifeless body of
his fireman, Van Tassell. The broken end
of a steam pipe pressed close to White's
neck and a jet of escaping steam scalded
his face. His head was swaying in a
death agony.
The bodies could not be moved until
Borne hours later, when the steam crane
of the Sacramento wrecking crew lifted
the overturned tender. White's left arm
end Van Tassell' s right leg were severed.
WORK OF THE WB.ECKEBS.
Engineer Denny Freel and Fireman Sam
uel Miller of the second engine were
hurled out upon the embankment unhurt.
Not one of the trainmen or passengers
was injured- Those occupying berths in
the Pullmans at the end of the train were
only conscious of a jar and many did not
even awaken. The mail car was pitched
across the trade and half telescoped.
Both engines lost their cabs. The ten
der of the first was smashed to pieces,
lying between the two locomotives, and
the other tender was thrown up against
the bank.
Engineer White evidently applied the
air brakes, and. after going forty yards,
his engine came to a standstill in the cut,
while the other drove itself into the bank
squarely beside the first and toppled as
far as the bank would allow.
PINNED DOWN BY TENDER.
There were a dozen coaches, including
four or five Pullmans, in the train which
left here on time at 10:55 o'clock last
night, with Conductor John Depangher in
charge. Two engines pulled it. Good time
Â¦was made to tne stretch of down grade
four miles cistant. There the engineers
ehut off steam and let the train move by
gravity.
The engines were moving thus when
they struck the switch. The forward lo
comotive kept down the main track, but
the second one shot upon the sid
ing:. In an instant both were off the rails
and jerking one another by the tender
strung between them.
REDDING, June 4.â The wrecking of the
Bouth-bound Oregon express at the open
switch live miles south of Redding short
ly after 11 o'clock last night, in which
Engineer James M. White and Fireman

and trainmen are inclined to believe that
no train robbers planned the destruction

undoubtedly done by tramps who had.
been kicked off a. freight train. The

TUCSON. Ariz., June 4.â Reports have
reached Guaymas of a battle at Huichori
Letween a detachment of the Second Bat
tallon and a troop of the Fifth Cavalry
and a band of iaqui rebels, who have
been in hiding in that country for some
time. On learning of fresh outbreaKs
the Ya'quis took courage and attacked tlie
Mexican troops. Fifteen Yaquis were re
ported killea in the engagement. One
Mexican v.as killed and nve wounded.
The excitement at Hermosulo, caused
by the disaster at Aguajito, has some
viiat abated. The population is reasdur
ed by the arrival of bw regulars from tne
Yaqui Hiver country. Tnese troops ar-s
preparing to go to tne assistance or Gen
eral Torres, who has withdrawn his sol
diers from the mountainous section and
fears to attack the Indians with the small
force now at his command.
The transport Oaxaca has arrived at
Guavmas from Mazatlan. bringing WW
soldiers and a large supply of ammuni
tion. These are now on their way to Her
moslllo to join the forces under General
The b present Yaqui raid had not caused
much consternation in Guaymas until the
report of the ambuscade at Aguajito was
received here. The people became greatly
aiarmed on hearing of the fate of the
command of Captain Gomez and the sad
death of that gallant officer. The prefect
of police at Guaymas called for volun
teers to be organized for the city's pro
tection in case the Yaquls should advance
toward the south.
The company of volunteers organized at
Hermosillo is quartered in the palace and
a special train has Just arrived from No
go les. bringing fifty Mauser rifles and 20,
000 cartridges, which will be distributed
among the men. Another company of vol
unteer reserves has been organized at the
German Club. Hermosillo, to be called out
in case of necessity. ' /
A runner arriving from Sabiate reports
that a band of 300 Y'aquis was seen near
that place on their way to join the main
bedy in the Mazatan Mountains. It is
believed that this band came from the
ranches near Carbo.
Reports from Costa are to the effect
that six Yaqui chiefs passed through that
section, recruiting troops from the peace
able Indians on the ranches. Indians who
have refused to join the insurrection have
taken refuge in Hermosillo. as those on
the warpath regard them as traitors and
would kill them on sight.

DE. PIERCE'S BE3EEDIES.
A PBOTURE \
Of health, we say of a perfectly health-'
fnl woman, and it is a picture everyone
loves to look upon. All the pictures of
all the artists who iave ever painted the
glory and beauty of womanhood, are
only copies and imitations of this picture.
Never artist
mixed a color
on his palette
that can vie
with the hues
which tint a
healthful wom-
an's cheek.
Why should
this charm be
sacrificed to
sickness ? It
need not be
save in rare
cases. The gen-
eral health of
woman is so
linked with the
local womanly
health that
wasted cheek
and sunken eye
are in general but evidences of womanly
diseases. Cure the diseases and the phy-
sical health is restored.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription cures
the ills of -women. It establishes regu-
larity, dries weakening drains, heals in-
flammation and ulceration, and. cures fe-
male weakness.
Mrs. Mary E. Lewis, of Tanner. Gilmer Co.,
Â¦W. Va., writes : "Â¦ I shall always recommend Dr.
Tierce's Favorite Prescription, 'Golden Medical
Discovery ' and ' Pleasant Pellets,' for they cured
me when doctors and other medicines failed.
For fifteen years I suffered untold misery.
When I commenced taking Dr. Pierce's meai-
daeÂ», I had given up all hope of ever getting
well, I could not lie down to sleep, and every-
thing I ate would almost cramp me to death.
Was very nervous and could hardly walk across
the room. I onlv weighed ninety pounds when
I commenced taking these medicines six years
Â»>.go ; now I weigh one hundred and forty pounds
end am having better health than ever before.
My friends all 6ay they can hardly believe that I
am the same person ; after being sick so long I
hare changed to be robust and rosy cheeked."
Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets invigorate
stomach, liver and bowels.

McComb then announced that he had
appointed Charles McDonnell and Joseph
"Windrow to be his deputies. Robert Den
nis, who has been a deputy in the offlc*
for five years, retires to go Into- business.
At 12:30 p. m. McComb left the court
room of Justice of the Peace Groealnger,
which he has been occupying ever since
his appointment was ratified by thÂ© Su
pervisors, and proceeded to the regular
office of the Justices' clerk. McComb
made a formal demand for the office, and
Fredrick, the Mayor's appointee, delivered
over the book3 and records and with
drew.
Fredrick will appeal from the order,
but in the meantime the business of the
Justices' court will be conducted *y Mc-
Comb.
The struggle for the office of Justices'
Clerk ended yesterday morning when
Powel Fredrick, the Mayor's appointee,
gave up the office to George McComb.
His action was due to an order issued by
Judge Sloss, who decided, aftsr reading
an agreed statement of facts submitted
by the attorneys for Fredrick and Mc-
Comb, that the first named was a
usurper and not entitled to the place.
The order and the subsequent evacuation
of Fredrick are the result of quo war

When a Call reporter visited the County
Clerk's office with the avowed purpose of
searching the vault in which the probate
papers are secured. County Clerk Mahony
detailed Probate Clerk Casey to make a
diligent search of the vault. Several boxes
filled with papers and documents of the
Fair case were examined, but without re
sult. On top of the small safe In which
the more valuable wills are kept was
found a bundle' of. papers, covered with
the accumulations of months of dust.
When these were examined the two deeds
alleged to have been stolen were found.
Attorney LJoyd said to a Call reporter
yesterday that the story of the theft of
the deeds was absurd on Its face. In the
first place the deeds, having been declared
forgeries by the court, could have abso
lutely no value tc# any one. The motive
for the theft was therefore absent. In the
next place Attorney Lloyd never sent
Kytka to the County Clerk's office for the
deeds, nor had he ever given the instru
ments a thought since the court made an
order directing that they be turned over
to him. He did not care if the deeds were
etolen, as they could In no wise be of
benefit to the thieves or any one else. He
regarded the published story as being in
the nature of a fight against Martin Kel
ly or County Clerk Mahony.
Kelly was seeking- to recover a certain
sum advanced by him to Mrs. Craven
secured by a mortgage on the property
described in the forged deeds, the story
of their theft was readily believed. Unfor
tunately for the veracity of the journals
interested, the rumor was not verified.
Some effort was made to secure the facts,
and when the deeds were not promptly
produced on demand by the representa
tives of the newspapers, it was at once
concluded that the rumor was true. The
Call declined to publish as a fact what
was on the face a mere unsubstantiated
report, lacking verification.
G. W. Michael, a former soldier, who is
now living at the New Western Hotel, re
ported to the police yesterday morning
that he had been robbed of $100 in the
"Moon" saloon, at the corner of Taylor
â¢ n< \.Â°', Far T, el i stre Â« ts . by two women.
Michael said he went into the saloon with
Vl? women Tuesday night' and after
drinking three glasses of soda .water re
membered nothing more till he awoke
yesterday morning. He believed he had
been given knockout drops In the soda
water.
Knockout Drops Given Soldier.
In the meantime the detective force Is
making every effort to capture Conway,
who is still believed to be in hiding in
the city. Captain Martin has given his
men orders to make a thorough search of
the tenderloin for the missing clerk.
J. W. Cassens, a Janitor at the Hall of
Justice, is positive that he saw Conway
on the cars at the corner of Hyde and
Union streets yesterday morning. Cassens
says he was riding downtown and saw
Conway, whom he says looked blear-eyed
and bloated from the effects of drink.
The investigation which the Grand Jury
is making. Into the records of the Police
Court has caused consternation among
the members of the Police Court ring. Aft
er a conference with Chief of Detectives
Martin the Grand Jury Committeemen
announced that they intended to examine
the records of every department of the
Police Court. It is theif intention to com
pare the judgment docket % and records of
the disposition of cases as kept by the
various clerks of the four Police courts
with the private records kept by the
Judges. If the system of "kitingr" bail
money has been practiced by other clerks
the investigation will develop that fact.
Additional sensational disclosures are
promised In connection with the Police
Court bail scandal. A committee from
the Grand Jury, accompanied by Expert
F. A. Elliot, visited the Hall of Justice
yesterday and commenced an examination
of the records of Judge Mogan's court.
It was rumored when the expert finished
his work yesterday afternoon that he had
discovered several more cases where
Frederick R. Conway, the missing Police
Court clerk, had appropriated bail money
to his own private use. Grand Jurors E.
P. Farnsworth and M. J. Vaughn made a
careful" investigation into the facts sur
rounding the four cases In which it Is
alleged Conway stole bail money that had
been declared forfeited by falsifying the
records and drawing fraudulent orders on
the city's treasury. They came to the
conclusion that there is good grounds for
the forgery charge that has been lodged
agrainst him. Upon their report to the
Grand Jury Conway will probably be in
dicted. â¢

In view of the recent compromise of
the Fair heirs with Mrs. Xettie R. Crav
en, in whose favor the deeds were ex
ecuted, for the sum of $50,000, and the
additional circumstance that Martin
STORY WAS BEIilEVEB.
Naturally, the publication of the stories
that the deeds were stolen caused some
excitement in the County Clerk's office.
It was alleged by the deluded newspapers
that the documents had been abstracted
from the vault in the County Clerk's of
fice for the ostensible purpose of bring
ing about a resumption of litigation in
the Fair case, and particularly as to the
property described in the documents. The
additional statement was made that the
theft was discovered when Attorney Reu
ben H. Lloyd sent to the City Hall
for the deeds, the custody of which was
awarded to him by Judge Troutt at the
close of the Craven-Fair litigation.
The newspapers which published sen
sational stories yesterday of the alleged
theft of the famous pencil deeds which
figured so prominently in the Fair estate
litigation and which were declared forger
ies by Judge Slack succeeded admirably
in uncovering a huge mare's nest. The
deeds, which it was alleged were stolen
by unknown parties for purposes un
known, were found within five minutes af
ter search for them was instituted by
Probate Clerk E. J. Casey and a Call re
porter yesterday afternoon.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE '
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
NEW YORK, -June 4.â Indignant and al
most starving, Mrs. Katherine Hartridge,
a comely, refined Englishwoman, was ar
raigned in court this morning, charged
with stealing $270 from Otto C. Kersgood,
a San Francisco confectioner, who had
been a fellow-passenger on the steamer
Advance from Asplnwall, and with whom
she had been playing bridge whist.
The accuser told how he had missed his
purse, which he had pinned in his coat
pocket, while the garment lay upon his
berth and he was washing his hands. He
reasoned by deduction that the woman
had stolen his money because she might
have slipped into his stateroom and taken
it without being seen. He declared that a
safety pin similar to that he had employed
to secure the pocket-book had been found
by the stewardess in a pin cushion in Mrs.
Hartridge's cabin. The prisoner indig
nantly denied 'the charge.
"I met thia man on board the steamer In
which we sailed from San Francisco," she
said. "Several ladies and half a dozen
of men played bridge whist, and this man
was oiie cf the players. We played for
luncheons, the beaten party having to pay
for sandwiches and beer or wine. He had
been in the saloon with fifteen others. I
was arrested at the gang plank in this
city. My effects were examined by the
customs officials and no money was found
I had $1.20 In my pocket-book."
She was remanded until to-morrow. "
"What am I to do?" faltered the prison
er, as a policeman took her into the pris
on. "I have not had a mouthful to eat
since. yesterday. I am starving." .
Million Dollars Lost in Fire.
- PHOENIX, A. T., June 4.â The forest
fires in Huachuca Mountains are dying
out. A small army of men from Tomb
stone, aided by soldiers from Fort Hua
chuca, diverted the path of the fire from
the Tombstone watershed and it Is burn
ing itself out on the barren higher range.
The damage to the timber and mining
camps is estimated at $1,000,000.
Senor Buencamino resented the sugges
tion that a government official had in
fluenced his testimony favorable to the
United States and declared that his law
practice was worth $1000 per month, so that
the 5290 paid him as salary could not have
been an inducement to him to sacrifice his
beliefs. He strongly opposed a colonial
system, declaring that that system made
Spanish rule a failure, saying that failure
should be a warning, to the United States
For the present, he said, the Filipinos
were obliged to have American guidance
as they had just emerged from Spanish
darkness into American civilization. Sen
or Buencamlno's hearing closed to-day
Some sharp talk occurred between
Chairman Cooper and Representative
Jones over questions put to witness espe
cially regarding religious matters In the
Philippines. Chairman Cooper asserted
that the questions put by Representative
Jones to the witness were a plain and
palpable attempt to arouse religious prej
udice. Jones commented on the fact that
the witness, who had changed his views,
"enjoyed a fat office" while I Agulnaldo
was a prisoner. Senor Buencamino stated
that he as well as Agulnaldo had been
captured, and that he was alive to-day
was due to the humanity of the Amer
ican army.
Witness said Aguinaldo had a palace for
a prison. It was formerly occupied by
Commissioner Worcester and the govern
ment paid $500 Mexican per month as
rental for It. It is as large as the White
House at Washington. The witness said
Agulnaldo lived in this house with his
family, with a physician at his disposal,
a retinue of servants, a carriage and an
allowance to provide food for the.estab
lishment. .
WASHINGTON, June 4.-Senor Buen
camino to-day continued his statement
before the Committee on Insular Affairs,
explaining the address to the American
Congress made by him advocating Philip
pine Independence. He said the original
document showed that he wrote' it as
Aguinaldo's secretary. He said he might
be obliged to divulge secrets of Agoncillo
and Lopez. He stated that there were
four Filipino agents abroad working at
odds and making independence impossible.

MORGAN UPSETS
A PERIL THEORY
Senator Says Nicaragua
Canal Is Quite
Safe.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â Discussion of
the project of constructing an isthmian
canal was begun by the Senate to-day.
Morgan of Alabama, chairman of the
Committee on Interoceanic Canals, opened
the debate, speaking nearly three hours.
A considerable portion of his speech was
devoted to an examination of the recently
suggested danger to the Nicaragua canal
route of seismic disturbances. This dan
ger he concluded, after a careful review
ot many authorities, existed only in tho
imagination of those who desired to de
feat any canal project. His study of the
situation had convinced him that really
there was no greater danger .from vol
canic and earthquake disturbances to the
Panama route than to the Nicaragua
route but he was satisfied that little
danger to either was anticipated.
Morgan reviewed at length the political
conditions in Colombia, finding in them
a grave menace to the United States in
the construction of a canal by the Pan
ama route. He presented also the pres
ent phases of the diplomatic negotiations
looking to the building of a canal by both
the Nicaragua and Panama routes. He
ciosed with a strong appeal for the pass
age of the Nicaragua bill.
The debate on the anti-anarchy bill
continued all day in the House. It was
without sensational features, being con
fined almost entirely to the legal and con
stitutional phases of the question. Jen
kins of (Wisconsin and Parker of , New
Jersey contended that the bill did not go
far enough; that the killing of the Pres
ident should be made punishable- by death,
without any limitation whatever.

Ohio, the other two speakers, supported
the measure as it came from the commit
tee. â¢

The Supreme Court this afternoon di
rected a > writ of ouster to issue against

pany and suspended the same on condi
tion that the company comply with the
State laws relating to corporations within
five days. The question of fine was re
served until further orders of the court.
The other packers against whom similar
information was filed were given until
June 18 to respond and file return to rule
Attorney New said that he wished to en
ter exceptions to the overruling of the
motion to quash the information. This
was regarded by the court and the Attor
ney General as the first indication . that
the beef trust would carry the case to the
Federal court.
Attorney General Crow stated that he
was willing to accept the fine if It would
not bar him. from proceeding against this
company the same as the other compa
nies. At this time the court announced
that it had overruled the motion of all
the packing companies to quash the in
formation filed against them by the At
torney General.
JEFFERSON CITY. Mo., JunÂ© 4.âAt
torneys Hagerman and New addressed
the Supreme Court this afternoon and
asked the court to allow the Schwarz
child & Sulzberger Packing Company to
accept the count in the Attorney Gen
eral's information to the effect that the
company is operating In this State wlth
ou a charter from the Secretary of State.
Hagerman and New stated that if tho
ccurt would accept that the company
would pay the $1000 fine imposed by law
and at once take out a charter, and then
this company would be on an equal fool
ing with the packing companies in the
proceedings against them for violating
the anti-trust law.
Attorney General Davies asked that the
injunction be made permanent, and Jus
tice Chester directed that it "continue un
til other or further orders of the court."
The injunction Is directed against Ar
mour & Co., Swift & Co., the Cudahy
Packing Company, the Hammond Com
pany, Schwarzschild & Sulzberger Com
pany, domestic and foreign corporations,
and against Nelson Morris, Edward Mor
irs and Ira N. Morris, copartners, car

from fixing and determining by combining
together the prices to be charged for

selves as to the- supply of meat to be
brought into this State by them, and
from acting upon any understanding
tending to diminish such supply, and from
fixing or maintaining prices of their and
each other's products by agreement.
ALiBANT, N. T., June- 4.â Supreme
Court Justice Chester to-day granted an
injunction -restraining certain beef pack
ing companies of the West from carrying
on business In this State In violation of
the Donnelly an ti- trust law. The order
â¢was served on the representatives of con
cerns In this city and Troy to-day, and
will be served on others throughout the
State as quickly as they can be reached.
It was obtained on the affidavit of D. W.
Meredith, a former manager of Swift t'z
Co.
The platform favors the restoration and
expansion of the merchant marine and to
this end demands the reformation of our
r.avigation and tariff laws; denounces the

increase of standard money arising from
the vast Increased production of gold
from our own and foreign mines aa a
demonstration of the truth of the Quan
titative theory of money, and condemns

The Philippine plank also created much
discussion, the committee being called
upon to consider all sorts of propositions
In behalf of the Filipinos, some of them
being in favor of immediate and complete
independence. It was only after hours of
argument that the plank was agreed
upon.

'J he majority of the committee was
against any such indorsement, saying
that they considered it out of place at the
present time to inject Bryan's name Into
the State campaign. The fight lasted well
into the night and it was nearly noon be
fore the report of the committee was

tN'DIANAPOLIS, JunÂ© 4.â The Demo
cratic State Convention was called to or
der at 10:40 o'clock by W. H. O'Brien,
vice chairman of the State Central Com
mittee. John W. Kern of Indianapolis
Â¦was made permanent chairman. The fol
lowing ticket -was nominated:
Senor de Ojeda, who succeeds the Duke
d'Arcos, comes. to Washington with ex
cellent credentials. He was secretary, of
the Â¦ Spanish Peace Commission j at Paris
and is at present Minister to Tangier. . . .
The change in the Spanish legation hers
came as a distinct surprise to all but the
intimate friends of the Duke d'Arcos. He
came to the- United States as the first
Spanish- Minister after the war,., and. nat
urally his position was a very delicate
one, requiring- the exhibition of infinite
tact to avoid unpleasant incidents. He
was very successful in his mission, while
socially his relations have been extremely
pleasant. It is thought the change is at
tributable entirely to the retiring Minis
ter's desire to secure the best possible
treatment for his impaired vision, which
has caused him much and growing con
cern. Therefore he has secured a transfer
to the Spanish legation at Brussels. There
he will be as near as practicable to an
eye specialist, who already has under
taken his treatment at intervals.
Herbert's marriage to the daughter of
Richard Wilson, as a result of which he
became closely related to the Vanderbilts.
the Ogden-Goelets and the Astors, will
not In any way interfere, according . to
opinion in London,. with his usefulness as
Great Britain's" Embassador at "Washing
ton. His record at Washington as
Charge d'Aff aires from 18S8 to 18S9 and
secretary of the British legation from 1892
to 1893, and his work as British agent on
the Venezuelan Commission eminently lit
him, so official belief inclines, for his
proposed new and important duties.
A recent dispatch from London stated
that before the new Embassador at
Washington should take up his duties the
salary attached to the position would
probably be put upon a par with the
highest paid in Great Britain's diplomatic
service, namely, that which is paid the
Embassador at Paris, Â£9000 a year.
Notice of Herbert's appointment came
to the State Department to-day; through
the British embassy here; At present Her
bert occupies a place without a Â¦ counter
part In the American' diplomatic service.
He is first secretary of the embassy, at
Paris, but with the rank of Minister
Plenipotentiary. In very few Instances
does the British Government employ an
official of high rank in the office of secre
tary of embassy.

by official analysis to be under suspicion. The
American people and the foreign ) consumer- have
learned to look to California for a pure supply. Our
brandies were injured once by a single shipment that
was sophisticated. But the prompt, public and offi
cial action of one of the Federal revenue officers here
so exposed the fraud that the shipment was chased
out of England and Southern Europe. This action
was evidence of good faith in a desire to .protect
our brandy, and since then English consumers and
the German Government have been large takers of
that product. Our Riesling wines have a fine Lon
don market, and' there is no doubt that our olive oil
and ripe pickled olives will finally capture a large
consumption in the British Isles. The only form in
which the ripe olive is known as a food in Europe
is the dry salted article furnished by Greece. The
duty of every Californian is to promptly expose any
body, by name, who injures us by adulteration ; of
our fine product of luxuries. There is in the world a
profitable market for every gallon of our pure wines,
brandies and oil, and for all sound ripe olives we can
produce and pickle in such condition as to keep and
bear transportation. We contend th/t the actual
producer or manufacturer should have the benefit of
his trademark. One may well look with suspicion
upon a wine, brandY or oil that is labeled simply
"California." The label should bear the name of the
producer or of a responsible house or dealer. Then
responsibility for aduljteratiojycan be traced and men
can be punished under Federal law for the violation
of a copyright in a trademark. This is a matter of
vast importance to California. There is profit in
commercial honor, and those guilty of commercial

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The Union and Central Pacific and the, Santa Fe
are straightening their lines, reducing grades and sub
stituting tangents for curves, to the great betterment
of their speed and service. These changes are de
manded and warranted by the increasing volume and
importance of transcontinental business. It may,
occur to large railroads that all this travel has to
make a great curve to reach Chicago at all. A tan
gent from Omaha to New York would save a degree
and a half of northing twice run, or three degrees in
unnecessary distance, o~ over two hundred miles. At
an average rate of fifty miles per hour that is a run
of four hours wasted in a great northerly curve that is
unnecessary. At forty miles, which may be assumed
as the rate of limited trains, the time lost is five hours.
Xo doubt the improvement made by taking out these
petty curves in the overland roads will suggest a tan
gent that will reduce the time to New York to nearly
three days from San Francisco.
As railroad policy for this city,. such reduction is of
vast importance. When the. isthmian canal is built
our ability to hold much conlmerce, which will other
wise never pass here, will depend upon the element of
time in transcontinental transmission. No doubt that
consideration is already affecting the policy of the
overland roads and causes the extensive physical bet
terments they are making.
If this be so, we are receiving the benefit of the
canal in advance of its construction.
A through car will further reduce the expected
shortening to four days. Chicago has heretofore
been very successful in her policy of breaking all
overland trips. She was formerly able to do the same
with all travel from the Northwest to New England.
But this was broken up when the Soo line was built
from St. Paul and Minneapolis directly across the
northern peninsula of Michigan.
The control of the roads concerned has now
changed, and New York dominates them. While this
shortening of time between Chicago and the Atlantic
seaboard is desirable, it is only a step -to what
ought to be. There should be no long stop nor
change of cars in Chicago for transcontinental pas
sengers. The transit of mails is now made continuous
by transferring at Englewood. Passengers should
have equal facility. There is no more need of chang
ing cars in Chicago than at Omaha or Cedar Rapids.
It is an unnecessary inconvenience. Passengers who
board a car at Oakland mole or Point Richmond
should be saved the delay and trouble, as well as the
extra charge of 50 cents for the inter-depot transfer,
which goes to the Parmelee Company/ .' Â¦'.*
THE time by rail on passenger trains from here
to New York is now about four days and four
hours. This is lo be reduced by four hours
through shortening the time on the New York
Central and Pennsylvania Central trains east
of Chicago. This is good as far as it goes.
The trains that accomplish the long run in that short
time do not need to do it by running at a dangerously
high speed, but by omitting stops. At present an un
necessary delay occurs in Chicago. That great city
has heretofore dominated the policy of the roads that
center there, and has succeeded in so arranging
time-cards that every through passenger must change
cars there, break the continuity of his journey and
wait from two and a half to eight hours before pro
ceeding.

Democracy, has no policy nor programme with re
spect to the Philippines, neither has it any with re
spect to American labor and capital, . unless free
trade, which threatens the welfare of both, should
be deemed the Democratic programme on that sub
ject. About all; that the opposition can say against
the positions taken in the Ohio platform is to assail
the administration or the army. It will not be diffi
cult to dispose of such attacks. The people know
that the country is prosperous, that public affairs
are being well managed, and will vote to keep
them so.
Upon those three issues of the time the position
of the Republicans of Ohio is impregnable. It is
known that when the Democrats had control of the
Federal Government they made no effort to enforce
the Sherman anti-trust law, nor did they enact a
single statute designed to controlor regulate /trusts.
On that issue the Republican record stands in oppo
sition to the Democratic record, and if the Demo
crats attempt to make the campaign this fall on that
issue they will be on the defensive from start to
finish.
One of the salient features of the platform is the
fullness with which the relations of labor and capi
tal, so far as they are subject of legislation, are
treated. After citing and indorsing a statement of
Lincoln, "CapitaJ is the fruit of labor- and could
never have existed if labor had not first existed," the
convention went on to declare: "To secure for labor
the consideration it deserves; to uphold the dignity
of toil; to create a healthy public opinion on the
subject of labor, and the justice of its receiving a
full^share of the values it creates; to bring labor and
capital together on common ground in the adjust
ment, of such questions as may concern these two
great factors in production, it is necessary that labor
should be intelligently organized. We believe that
fewer. hours and larger rewards for labor harmonize
the interests of labor and capital and tend to -lighten
the burden of toil." .
Equally explicit is the declaration concerning the
Philippines. The platform says: "The war with
Spain was forced on us against our will, and the
Philippines came to us as one of the results of that
conflict. We are responsible for peace and order in
the islands, and our sovereignty must be as absolute
as our responsibility. ; Our titlfc.to the islands is as
perfect as was that of Spain after nearly 400 years
of undisputed possession. We will give their people
better government, better schools, more civil and
political rights and a higher civilization and broader
freedom than are possible for them in any other way.
Our flag is in the Philippines, and there it will re
main."
Upon the three issues that now chiefly engage. the
attention of the country, the trust problem, the Phil
ippines and the relations of labor and capital, the
platform speaks, with ample force and fullness!
Upon the first issue Democratic agitators who are
.so noisy in their shouts, against so-called monopo
lists are met by the statement: ... "The Republican
party is the only one that has dealt courageously
and honestly with the! trust question. It enacted as
early as 1890 a law framed by that distinguished
statesman, John Sherman," to prohibit and punish
combinations in restraint of trade, the control of
wages, or the advancement of prices. This act,
framed by a Republican statesman, passed by a Re
publican Congress and /signed by a Republican
President, has proved helpful in preventing abuses
by such combinations where such abuses were found
to exist, and x isÂ° now being applied by a
Republican administration in the prosecution of un
lawful combinations."
OWING to the importance of Ohio as a Stata
and the eminence of its representatives in
Congress the platform adopted by the Ohio
Republicans has naturally attracted widespread "at
tention. It is the first clear: enunciation from -an
authoritative source of thfc issues upon which the
party will make the Congressional campaign and the
grounds upon which it will ask the-votes- of the peo
ple. The .platform is the more interesting because
it was drawn &p by. the friends ' of Senator Hanna,
who has so frequently been "spoken of as a candidate
for the Presidency, and who in, many respects is *the
foremost Republican in Congress:'
THE OHIO PLATFORM.
One of the curious freaks of the intense heat that
swept down upon Martinique is stated in the report
that in one of the ruined, buildings there were found
a number of glasses that had been fused, twisted and
flattened, but the wooden shelf on which they rested
was not charred. In another place there were found
a doll and a small table set of metal plates; the metal
was fused, but the body of the doll was not burned.
Just how such things occurred is one of the problems
that science will have to work at for a long time be
fore it finds the solution. .
The~ Chutes presents an Orpheum pro
gramme this week. The entertainment
furnished the visitors is very good. Dooley
and Fowley, Bacon and Vane, the Two
Lamonts and other clever performers are
on its bill. _* 'Â¦''
The Neill Company is doing well with
"The Red Knight," Broadhurst's latest
play. It is a romantic comedy and
abounds in humor. A number of changes
have been made by the author and the
production runs smoothly. The Neill
Company is at its*best and the efforts of
the members are appreciated. The mount
ings for the play are very handsome.
Well filled houses have -been noted at
every performance. Next week "The Jilt"
will be presented.
Peter Dailey and his clever company are
in their last week at the Orpheum. Their
performance of "A Dress Rehersal" is one
of the best things produced at the pop
ular house In months. Daily is simply
inimitable. Irene Franklin has a number
of new songs which she renders in clever
manner. Lottie Gladstone- has proven
herself one of the cleverest women ' in
her line who has ever, visited the Or
pheum. Le Roy and Clayton are fun
makers; Murphy and Slater do some very
clever dancing, and the balance of the
bill is exceptionally good.
"The Sidewalks of New York" has
proved an immensely popular attraction
at the Central Theater this week. The
scenic effects are of a rare order and the
specialties are excellent. Little Reyna
Belasco, in her dances, , charms the au
diences, and comes in for several encores
nightly. The Paloma Quartet of . female
voices also receive hearty plaudits. Next
week the Central will produce the popular
Eastern drama, "A Guilty mother," with
the strongest cast in the history of the
house, including Fanny Mclntyre, An

The "Toy Maker" is drawing well at
the Tivoli. This popular opera was a
great success last season and those who
have seen it before are coming back a
second and even a third time to listen to
the catchy music and laugh at the antics
of Hartman, Webb, Cashman and the
dolls. The work of Miss Myers has been
exceptionally good, despite the fact she
has been indisposed. The toy shop scene
is extremely funny. New songs have been
introduced and the opera is better
mounted than before. '[ v
Maud Fealyf the youngest leading lady
who has ever played in this city, is mak
ing a great success at the Grand Opera
house. During the present week .she is
scoring heavily in "My Lady Dainty."
The play is from the pen of that prolific
and clever writer, Iviadeline Lucette Ry

splendidly mounted. The company gives
excellent support to Miss Fealy.
This is the last week of the popular
members of Alcazar Stock Company. Mr.
Alsop and Miss Converse complete their
"season next Sunday night. Their work
during the past three months has been of
high order. They have won popularity
and they will be missed by the patrons of
the house. "His Wife's Father" finishes
the week. Â¦
The demand for seats for the /Florence
Robert season, which begins at the Al

The Board of Education yesterday ex-^
onerated Dr. M. E. Blanchard,; principal
6t the Hancock grammar school, of the
charges of unprofessional conduct in hav
ing, it was alleged, dictated a' false re
p6rt regarding the punishment adminis
tered by him to a pupil named John Rag
giG. The resolutions of exoneration re
cite that the only evidence in support of
the charges was given by Miss Emma
Perry, whose reputation for truth and ve
racity the board holds to have been suc
cessfully impeached. The resolution con
tinues:
Whereas. Certain charges of violation of the
rules of the Board of Education and of un
professional conduct have heretofore been for
mally presented by the Superintendent of Com
mon Schools against Dr. M. E. Blanchard, prin
cipal of the Hancock Grammar School; and
Whereas, A hearing of said charges was had
before this board on May 26, May 27 and May
2S. 1002, . and said matter was- submitted for
the consideration and determination of Â¦ this
board: and
"Whereas. As to specifications I and n of
said charges, the same were disregarded at
said hearing as having heretofore been acted
upon by this board, and as to the remaining
specifications, no sufficient evidence having
been adduced in support thereof except the
testimony of one witness whose reputation for
truth and veracity was successfully Impeached;
now. therefore, be it
Resolved, That this board finds said charges
not sustained, and that Dr. M. E. Blanchard
be and is hereby fully exonerated therefrom.
Director Roncovieri opposed the adop
tion of the resolution on the ground that
there never was a trial of Principal Blan
chard on the charge' of 'cruelly beating
Pupil Raggio, although the trial could
have been held under the provisions of
the Political Code. The resolution exoner
ating Blanchard was then adopted, with
Dfnman, Mark and 'Woodward in favor
and Roncovieri against.
Superintendent of Schools Webster filed
a communication In which he stated that
on the advice of his attorney he had de
cided to do nothing with the charges
against G. H. Foulks preferred by Mrs.
G. M. Finks. The board adopted the re
port of the Superintendent and agreed to
take no action. It developed that Foulks'
accuser had failed to appear to back up
her charges.
A resolution was adopted providing that
all pupils who have not been regularly
promoted to any high school in this city
or State and who desire to enter any San
Francisco high school may take an ex
amination for admission to the high
schools on Tuesday, July 22, 1002, at Low

was taken under advisement.
Secretary Deane called attention to the
fact that coal cost the people of Califor
nia 510,000,000 in 1901. All that money went
out of the State. He predicted that the
present year would show a reduction in
the amount paid for coal of one-half, or
$5,000,000. Oil was taking the place of coal
as fuel. The association had perfected
an envelope Index of 1200 California oil
companies, together with maps of every
oil district in the State, with the produc
ing territory marked on them. The work
of the association in the last twelve
months was described. iA.n exhibition of
California petroleum and of the Industry
connected with the production was rec
ommended for placement In every com
mercial museum In the United States.
Money would be needed for thi3 and leg
islation would have to be looked after In
Sacramento the coming winter, the secre
tary said. Â¦ 7
There is no reason why the great oil Industry
should be smirched by a lot of schemers leas
ing a few acres of land and promising to
pay impossible dividends, and even sometimes
paying a few out of the very money they re
ceive from the sales of stock.
Many letters come to us asking for informa
tion and advice as to* which oil company the
writer should buy stock in. We have invariably
answered that we gaVe no such advice, but
referred" to responsible brokers. The result of
our action Is that to-day there are really very
few companies In California working on the
credulity of the public, for they know they
will be exposed by this association just as soon
as it comes to their knowledge. Ws hope to
continue this good work, regardless of whose
head we may hit.
When the present directors took office they
found that there ! were in the association, as
members, many fake oil companies. Our first
work was to weed them out, which we did
without sparing the knife. Any oil company
that -was not really improving lta land, or
whose management we had any reason to be
llevo was simply aTstock sellinsr proposition,
we erased from our books. We also refused to
accept as members any oil company which
did not have something to show as a legiti
mate oil proposition to Its stockholders. We
commenced a crusade against fake companies,
both here and throughout the East, mere catch
penny advertising schemes, by answering hun
dreds of letters, writing to the principal papers,
and publishing in every way that we were
ready to tell exactly the truth without cost
to the Inquirers.
Secretary Deane told of the work of the
association in the direction of weeding out
of fake oil companies. In part, he said:
The reports that were submitted by
Vice President Briggs and Secretary C. T.
Deane reviewed the happenings of the
year. Mr. Brigga spoke of the loss by
death of J. M. Gleaves, who was the first
vice president of the association. Mr.
Briggs said the association had received
enough encouragement from the public to
warrant the continuation of its work. He
advocated keeping the association upon a
high plane, having for its only purpose
the advancement and promotion of the oil
Industry in this State. It should be to the
mining of petroleum what the California
Miners' Association has been to the min
ing for precious metals, he said. Its in
terest would eventually be felt in all the
commercial and manufacturing centers of
the world. - .
An, annual meeting. of the California
Petroleum Miners' Association was new
yesterday. Reports were received and dt
rectors-were elected. The board of direc
tors includes M. H. de Young, Arthur K-
Briggs, E. P. Heald, G. X. Wendling, E.
A. Denicke, Henry J. Crocker, W. A. Ja
cobs, Ed Aigeltinger, C. T. Deane, George
H. Ismon and Joseph Chanslor.'- In the
absence of the president, Arthur K.
Briggs, the vice president, presided.
The Governor has announced his programme as to
Colonel Otis, who is to be sued in civil damages,
while Mr. Spreckels and Mr. Leake are to be treated
criminally. But there is a portentous uncertainty
about what is to happen to Mr. de Young, which may
result in that gentleman's permanent exile. As for
him, the Governor threatens to deal with him "ap
propriately." This may mean by court-martial, of
the drum-head variety, or some other novel method.
Perhaps it may suit the proposed victim of appro
priate punishment to negotiate before he surrenders
by re-entering this jurisdiction. As for us, we are
here and can only sit and wait for the executive light
ning to strike. When it flashes we are completely
ready. . *
But this resort to the courts does not excuse the
Prison Directors. They may get interaction as soon
as they please. There may arise delays in the courts,
and the lime in the Directors' whitewash may over
slackj or the bristles loosen in their brush. The peo
ple have read the evidence as far as it has been dis
closed, and they want to know what sort of Prison
Directors the State hss.
We will endeavor to please- him by making it com
plete, unless it shall turn out that in seeking a crim
inal remedy he may be able to abridge the investiga
tion behind some limitation in the presentation of
evidence. As such abridgment would not serve. his
purpose for vindication, we assume that he seeks not
to be whitewashed on one side but on all, and will
not take advantage of any restriction.
We are gratified to agree with the Governor in in
dorsement of the courts and a desire to seek a judi
cial finding in the matter. It is for him to explain
why publications which on May 26 nowhere accused
him of wrongdoing, according to his Los Angeles
interview, became libels upon him. on June 3. It is
no doubt a pleasure to him to seek vindication in the
courts, but it will be observed that, though on pleas
ure bent, he has a frugal mind, for by beginning
criminal proceedings he puts the cost of his proposed
Vindication upon the taxpayers, whereas in a civil
suit he has to give b'ond for those costs and luxuriate
at his own expense. But as we cannot control ,his
methods we highly approve of his resort to the judi
cial tribunals. The Prison Directors have no judicial
powers and cannot issue a subpena and compel at
tendance of witnesses; they seem powerless even to
secure inspection of the books of the prison, which
are public records and by law open to all. But a
court can issue subpenas to witnesses and compel
their attendance, and a subpena duces tecum to the
clerk and secretary and. Warden of the prison and
compel them to bring books, bills and records into
court. Evidently the Governor studies to please, and
he pleases us by making the inquiry judicial.
His second statement is- in . one of his San Fran
cisco organs, the Examiner, in the form of a signed
statement, published June 3. In this he says: "So
far as Warden Aguirre is concerned I have known
him a great many years. I believe him to be a thor
oughly honest man. * * * I have confidence in
the man and believe in his integrity, but if he has
done anything criminally wrong he must stand the
consequences. But, as to myself, I know that prior
to and ever since my induction into the Governor's
office I have been an honest man, and I know that
these publications are a libeL upon me. I propose to
punish the publishers thereof, both civilly and crim
inally. It is my intention to arrest John D. Spreckels
and Sam Leake for their publications, and to sue the
Los Angeles .Times and Colonel Otis for their con
nection with the affair; and as to De Young, I will,
when he comes within the jurisdiction of the State
courts, deal with him appropriately. I propose to
submit my case to the courts of the State, where I
believe justice will prevail." .
SINCE the San Quentin methods were revealed
and discussed the Governor has referred to the
affair in two statements. The first appeared in
his Los Angeles organ, the Record, on May 26. .In
that, referring to the' publication in The Call, he
said: "You will notice that nowhere in these articles
is it said that I had any knowledge of wrongdoing or
participated knowingly in anything wrong." It ; is
easy to see that a man may be the innocenf and un
conscious beneficiary of a crime. He may eat stolen
food, receive a stolen horse as a gift, and in countless
ways be the direct beneficiary of crime, and be per
fectly innocent. That was the Governor's view of his
situation on the 26th ult.
On the one hand it means the defense of the pub
lic health against that which endangers it, and on the
other it protects the producer against loss arising in
fraudulent competition.;. It is time for efficient statu
tory action. Let us have it. â¢
dishonor should be promptly punished. In a few
months nominees for State officers and the, Legisla
ture will be before the people?asking votes. What
better or more worthy issue can be 'injected into a
campaign than this? The voters are. the taxpayers.
Their capacity to support the State government is
inherent in their profits gained in industrial produc
tion. The wool-growers" of the country are asking
Federal legislation to protect them '- against shoddy
fabrics and the consumer from fraud in his clothing.
The butter-makers are protected by recent legislation
against the substitution of oleomargarine. Why do
not our producers of wine, brandy, oil and olives
deserve as much protection as these, and why should
not the State and Federal governments give it?

TO SUBSCRIBERS LEAYIHG TOWN FOR THE SUMMER.The claims of San Francisco specula

were refused on the ground that the ship
had not arrived at Portland, Or.; that a
call at San Francisco was not provided
for in the policies, and that the vessel had
been condemned and was a loss anyway.
The San Francisco claimants based their
demand for payment on the ground that
the vessel was sufficiently seaworthy to
have reached Portland and the old world

examined her reported that it would take

Under the German rule of underwriting
this made her a total los$. She was con

The dispatch reads, "We are willing to

mulated since the last meeting. The flre which
occurred In the fern' depot on June 2 damaged
the roof and rooms of the State Mining Bureau
to the extent of $106 50. The payroll for May
was allowed and ordered paid. It amounts to
$24,105 75, against $22,727 40 for April. People
that fought their way along the water front
through the dust clouds raised by the .May

to learn that the Harbor Commissioners ex

IRISH HORSE WINNER OF
THE DERBY. AND HIS AMER
ICAN RIDER,
Movements of Steamers.
Orndorff stripped for the fray and creat
ed consternation in the ranks of Holden's
followers by -.the development of his bi
ceps and forearm. Holden went to pieces
andv Orndorff was nervous. As a result
neither man reached the 100 mark. Orn
dcrff bowled 87 and Holden 75. When the
contestants started the second frame the
betting had switched. Orndorff was fa
vorite and Holden retired to the place
formerly occupied by the stage manager.
The game was excitingi'Orndorff winning
by one point. The score was 65 to 64.
After the performance Tuesday night
Orndorff with his seconds and Holden
with his "gang" repaired to the alley.
The betting was 10 to 1, with Holden on
the long end. No one fancied Orndorff's
chances and Holden entered the match a
topheavy favorite.
The date set" for the contest was Tues
day night and the Owl bowling alley was
chosen as the place of meeting. In the
interim Orndorff . visited various alleys
and learneda few wrinkles in the gams.
He knew what a "strike" was without go
ing'on one and "spares" appealed to him.
Some days since George A. Holden,
master mechanic at the Orpheum Thea
ter, became proud" of. his ability as a
bowler and challenged every toiler in the
theater to bowl him for money or mar
bles. Holden scared, off every one except
Harr"y Orndorff , the stage manager. The
latter' accepted.- the challenge.
Martin is of the same school as Henry
Spencer and the late 'Dick'" Clawson and
is an accomplished horseman. v
HAEKY 0B2TD0RFF WINS
CLOSE BOWLING MATCH
He was among the first of the American
riders to follow Tod Sloan to Europe,
where he was uniformly successful. He
is noted for liis vigorous finishes. This
characteristic of his work in the saddle
got him into trouble with Mr. Gubbins
recently. The latter, who was one of the
most celebrated amateur steeplechase
riders in Ireland forty years ago. objected
to the amount of punishment Martin in
flicted on one of his horses. He kept him
on the ground some time.
"Skeets" Martin, who *ode the winner,
is essentially a California jockey. He has
ridden on this coast during the past six
seasons and first came into prominence
here. He then went East, where he made
a hit.
MABTIN A CALIFOBNTA BOY.
Mr. Gubbins, the owner of Ard Patrick,
is an Irishman who owns a bip stud of
horses at Limerick. He owned Galtee
More, which won tbe Derby In 1897. Mr.
Gubbins subsequently sold Galtee More
to the Russian Government for Â£21,000. j
Martin . followed, up his' Derby success
by riding, a dead heat in the race for the
Caterham plate,: in one of the besf fin
ishes ; ever seen at Epsom. Gun Club,
ridden by M. Cannon, was a strong fa
vorite and when within a stone's throw
of home seemed an.' easy winner.- Then
inch by inch Mar.tin. urged 'the Fledgling
filly on. till the public,; thought -'she had
won. 1 King .Edward witnessed the race
with the keenest interest. When a dead
heat was announced the crowd cried out:
"Well done, Martin."
brown colt. Ard Patrick first; Colonel Hen
ry McCaimont's bay colt Rising - Glass
second; the Duke of Portland's brown colt
Friar Tuck third. Eighteen horses ran.
The betting was 100 to 14 against Ard
Patrick, 40 to I 1 against Rising Glass, and
100 to 7 against Friar Tuck. The result
completely, upset all calculations. It was
considered a' one-horse race, but Scep
ter never flattered her supporters.
'Martin said after the 'race: "The. train
er, Mr. Darlington, cautioned me -that
there was but "one run in the colt and to
held him, .but 1 found. him so keen that
when -I got.-weai off at. the start I deter
mined to keep the place "and make the
pace. /Fearing that -Scepter might over
take Vis I loosened the rein for a few
strides and then Ard Patrick seemed to
lag, but with one kick in his side he re
turned, to his former speed and I never
had another, fear. Rising Glass attempt
ed to challenge later, .but he never was
dangerous and we came home easy win
ners." â ' . .- Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦ Â¦ - .,.

PITCHEBS ABE HABD HIT.
LOS ANGELES, June 4.â Oakland took
the first game- of the present series by a
terrific batting streak, most of the dam
age being done in the first inning, when
the visiting team touched up McPartlin
lor eight hits, scoring six runs. Mohler
led off with a two-bagger to left field,
Francks put the ball in the same place
lor three bases and nearly every other
man on the team lined it out to the same
Bpot. Hannivan, who retired to the bench
after the first inning, misjudged five files.
During the rest of the game the fielders
Â¦were kept busy, as both Oakland pitchers
and McPartlin were hit freely. Oakland
made three runs in the sixth and three
more ln the ninth. Hodson and Schmidt
â¢were batted almost as hard as McPartlin.
the home team getting eleven hits off
their delivery, but not enough of them
came together to overcome Oakland's big
lead. There was a chance in the ninth,
when Slagle came to the bat with the
bases full and but one man out. The three
hits that followed were good for as many
runs. Francks' remarkable fielding was
a feature. Toman was not far behind him
in fast work. Score:

Three-base hit*â Toman and Francks. Two-
The Ponies and Trainer Harris came up
from the south, where they had swell pas
ture to make them feel like a bunch of
two-year-olds, and acted like a lot of colts
on the Oakland course yesterday after
noon. Sacramento, of course, was tbe suf
ferer, and for the twelfth consecutive time
the rear gruard of the league fell down.
The final damage this time was 8 to 2. It
should not have been so bad, but the Sen
ators did uumcrous erratic turns when
they ought to have been good.
It was not a good game of ball to look
at. It lacked vim and blood-curdling in
cidents and all other attachments which
are wont to make the fans yell and tear
their hair and do other funny stunts. May
be the Oakland public missed Bill Dever
eaux or perhaps the crowd was composed
mostly of regular church-goers^ but at all
events it looked more like a scientific talk
on social science than an exhibition of the
national sport.
Harry Kane acted as the local slabster
and did good work. His old-time wlldness
Â¦was just a little in evidence, but he acted
better than on any previous occasion at
home. Cutter mixed up the dope for the
Senators and was a trifle unsteady. He
has not recovered from his stage fright
vet, but otherwise he was there. Rajik
errors unnerved him throughout the game
and he did not have a good chance to set
tle down.
The error column tells the story of the
Senatorial disaster. Some timely hitting
â¢was indulged in by the Ponies, but on sev
eral occasions they ecored more runs than
Â¦were Cue. The Senators never found Kane
when a hit meant a run or so. The south
paw refused to get rattled when any of
the sacks were occupied.
Hulen played a star game at the middle
bag. McNichols made a wonderful stop of
a hard grounder from Sheehan's club.
Wagner forgot to exert his gray matter
when Shugart hit a high fly to the left
garden and the Cap got a double Instead
of being called out. Josh Reilly showed
â¢what a true sportsman he ls by playing
third for Harris against the team whose
honer he upheld last week. The score:

PAINE'S CELEBT COMPOUND.
Summer Energy and
Activity.
If Yon Are Nervous, Despondent,
Sleepless, Irritable or Out*
of-Sorts in June,
PAINE'S CELERY
COMPOUND
Will Give You Nerve Force,
Fresh Energy, Vigor, and
New Health.
June should be the banner month of the
year for the enjoyment of nature and ale.
If men and women are not physically ca-
pable of enjoying the good things of na-
ture and home so bountifully provided by
an All-Wise Creator, the fault is their
own in the majority of cases.
Our nervousness, insomnia, desponden-
cy and irrltableness are continual and
forcible reminders of ill health and dis-
ease. Their continuance in June means
unhappiness and misery; their banish-
ment by the use of Paine's Celery Com-
pound means energy, activity, vigor and
full ability to enjoy Heaven's best gifts.
Thousands are now acquiring rugged
health and buoyant spirits through the
use of Paine's Celery Compound. The
blessings of health, home and nature will
be your portion if you wisely use the
great medicine this month. It truly
makes people well.
GET A MOVE ON YOU-
Do it now, and leave a call for our
wagon to get your laundry parcel this
week, then and not until then will you
know the satisfaction that clean, white
and perfectly finished linen can give.
"We know how to do it, do do it, and if
it's not pleasing to your eye and sense of
what's right we'll make It so.
No saw edges.

OLD PEOPLE -g~^
Do not always receive the sympathy and attention which Â®]w' w|
they deserve. Their ailments are regarded as purely Â§l*f^k iSw
imaginary, or natural and unavoidable at their tnne of iBr?^ Tis
life. Disease and infirmity should not always be associ-^?g^^>^Mk
ated with old age. The eye of the gray haired grandsirefllflill^^pP
may be as bright and the complexion as fair as any ol'Wm$Â»Sy0t*'
his younger and more vigorous companions.
Good Blood Is tho secret of healthy old age, for it regulates
and controls every part of the body, strength'ens the nerves, makes the
muscles elastic and' supple, the bones strong and the flesh firm; but when
this life fluid is polluted or poisoned and loses its nutritive, health sustain-
ing elements, then there is a rapid decline of the vital powers, resultinp-
m premature old age and disease. Any derangement of the blood quickly
shows itself in an ulcer, sore, wart, tumor or some other troublesome
growth upon the body, and rheumatic and neuralgic pains become almost
constant, accompanied with poor digestion and cold extremities.
/^^* S~*S S Â£ S.S.S. being purely vegetable, is the safest and.
fQI f^< CO* purifier for old people. It does not shock
>^\ Â°r hurt the system like the strong mineral remedies
N</ but g entlv and thoroughly cleanses the blood and
m^ -r g^ stimulates the debilitated organs, when all bodily
ailments disappear. S. S. S. is just such a tonic as old people need to
improve a weak digestion and tone up the Stomach. If there is any heredi-
taiy taint, or the remains of some disease contracted in early life, S. S. S.
â¢will search it out and remove every vestige of it from the system. '

Concerning the settlement Perry Con
well said: "The alliance is content. Both

speedily came to an agreement. There was
no stubbornness nor ill feeling. The mat

alliance agreed to allow the smaller res
taurants to continue to pay night cooks
HO a week, the larger ones paying 112.
l'he demand for 50 cents more a day for
extra cooks was withdrawn, as was the
$10 a week demand for waiters. Instead
waiters accept $1 55 a day instead of |1 35

As for the reason why I madÂ© that affidavit,
I did it so that I might keep out of a nasty
moss. On Saturday Nusbaumer demanded to
know what I knew about the matter. I saw
that he had all * of the facts and In order to
show that I was an Innocent party to tha deal
I made the. affidavit. I have not seen Mr.
Daniels to-dav. but I believe that I am still
connected with the Enquirer.
G. B. Daniels had little to add outslda
ofjhis printed statement:
Jhis is another water company Job. As for
Stedman, I don't know why he made that affl-
away in the vault so that another
order for .^printing could be Dlaced. I
know that the Oakes order was never
printed for this reason: I took the order
for the work and turned it Into the Enquirer's
job department. There was never any demand
made for copy, and when I wanted to sret copy
upon which the men could work I was told
that that would be attended to and saw at
once that there was no Intention of ever mak
ing . the books. I know that the book* were
never made or delivered.
Judge Carroll Cook has set the hearing
of the case to determine which of the two

The Alhambra Theater was packed to
the doors last night, the occasion being
the entertainment given to help raise the
debt from the Church of the Holy Re
deemer. The sacred edifice was erected
less than a year ago through the efforts
of the pastor, the Rev. J. P. McQuaide,
and last night's receipts went far in the
good cause.
The first part of the programme was in
the hands of the members of the Olympic

letics. Some boxing bouts were also given
and Jimmy Britt appeared on the stage
for a moment.' This was followed by a
contralto solo by Miss Lilian J. Wilson,
which was warmly received. The Elks'
quartet rendered several selections. Harry
Wood Brown, .the popular tenor, just from
New York; and William Ogelvie also sang
and all were loudly applauded. Miss Nel
lie B. Waters made a big hit with her
sleighbell act, which was equal to a pro

Russer R. Stedman, whose, affidavit i3
tho most sensational, makes the flat as
sertion that the books found are not part
of the order given Oakes. The position
of Stedman is the most peculiar in the af
fair. Stedman has been connected with
the Enquirer for years, long before Dan
iels assumed control, and he-has always
attended to the county printing and ad
vertising and political work for the paper.
He continued in this department when
Daniels assumed control, and now he ap
pears as the maker of an affidavit charg
ing his employer with felony. This is
Stedman's statement to-day:
The books found in that vault are not part
of those covered by the order given Oakes.
They are some previous order that was put
STET>MAN'S EXPLANATION.
They have said enough about political enmity
and corporation attack, but they don't explain.
They are ready to accuse other people of doing
things that they are doing themselves.
Russel R. Stedman declared that those
books had been made by the Enquirer but
that they were old stock that had been
In the vault for years, and that they were
not the books called for in the order he
A demand was made upon the deputies
for the seventy-five books covered by the
Oakes-Enqulrer order, and the present set
of fifty-nine working assessment books
was pointed out. An investigation of the
accounts in the County Expert's office
showed that on October 3, 1901, a bill for
exactly fifty-nine such books had been
paid. This disposed of that set of books
and showed that an order for fifty-nine
books had been given and filled six weeks
subsequent to the Oakes-Enquirer order
which was given August 19.
At this point the deputies referred the
matter to their absent chief, and it being
nearly noon time the battalion of Inter
ested ones made a move for the nearest
lunch tables. Dalton telephoned to the
District Attorney's office that he would be
present at 1:30 o'clock.
There was another demand for the books
covered by the Oakes-Enquirer order af
ter lunch, and then Chief Deputy Thomas
M. Robinson showed the way to a vault
in the cellar and uncovered fifty-eight
working assessment rolls, being seventeen
short of the number called for in the dis
puted order. No mortgage books at all
were found, making the number of books
short of the original order, forty-seven.
From there the interest moved to the
Assessor's ' office and Bromley, accom
panied by his two attorneys, and County
Expert John M. Sabin, made an effort
to find Assessor Dalton. The Assessor
was out but had left word that he would
be back at noon time.
So it left the matter up to the deputies
of County Assessor Dalton to produce
seventy-five working assessment rolls and
thirty mortgage books which were repre
sented by the bills allowed by the Super
visors and the two checks issued by J. B.
Lanktree. If the books could be produced
the case fell. If they could not be found
explanations were due from the Assess
or's office and those to whom the order
was given.
The first assault was made upon the
District Attorney's office. Attorney Al
len declared that he would have to make
an investigation before he could act. At
this point Nusbaumer's client, Ross P.
Bromley, announced that he was ready to
swear to the warrants against Dalton and
Daniels. District Attorney Allen declined
to accept his oath until there had been an
investigation made by his own office.
Then Emil Nusbaumer produced . another
man who was ready to make oath to tha
complaints in the person of Russel R.
Stedman, the employe of the Enquirer
who had made such a positive statement
about the books never having been de
livered. But the District Attorney refused
to act.
No one seemed to know what to ex
pect. Even the accused seemed a little
uncertain as to what was going to de
velop during the day. County Assessor
Dalton had said that the matter was "up
to his deputies," and G. B. Daniels did
not remember the little transaction,
though he was certain that if the order
had ever been given the books had beeen
delivered. George Oakes had sworn that
he had been given an order for the books
which he had promptly turned over to
the Enauirer and that when checks had
been issued by J. B. Lanktree in payment
for the work that he had indorsed one if
not both of them over to G. B. Daniels.
The checks had been paid and the bills
for the work had been paid, those were
two undisputed facts, but these were met
with the affidavit of Russel R. Stedman
that he had delivered the order for the
work to the Enquirer, but that the work
had never been done or delivered. More
than that Stedman did not know.
WITHHOLDS THE WARRANTS.
OAKLAND, June 4.â Great interest
was centered in the courthouse
to-day when it became known
that there was a. move on foot to
have County Assessor Henry P.
Dalton and G. B. Daniels, preside-nt of
the Enquirer Publishing Company, ar
rested for obtaining the money for an or
der for assessment books that were never
delivered.
The movement of the people toward the
court house was caused by the publica
tion in 1 the morning papers that Emil
Nusbaumer had laid before District Attor
ney Allen certain affidavits involving Dal
ton and Daniels, together with a request
for warrants for their arrest on a charge
of felony.. Emil Nusbaumer. headed ear^y
for District Attorney Allen's office to see
it that official had decided to issue these
warrants. Accompanying Nusbaumer was
the "mysterious" client for whom >-us
baumer says he is working and whose
name he declined to divulge last night.
That client proved to be Koss P. Brom
ley, a young real estate man and expert.
Accompanying them was M. C. Chapman,
who appeared as associate attorney with
Nusbaumer for Client Bromley.
Following these came another battalion
of less interested people, composed of
County Expert John M. Sabin, Kussel R.
Stedman, the member of the Enquirer
staff who accused his employer of rob
bing the county of Alameda, members of
both the city and county governments,
members of the Board of Supervisors,
and unattached politicians generally. For
whatever the gravity of the charge and
however much it might affect the integ
rity of officials and the finances of the
county, it seemed impossible to divorce
the charges from the political situation in
Oakland.
I am told that these books that they have
found in an old vault are old stock, and I be-
Hf ve inK I* 011 '* Relieve -that they are part of
the 105 books ordered at that time, and I don't
believe that that order of books was ever filled
I told the District Attorney that they would try
and ring in some old stock on us. and they
have done so. First they tried to work off on
tw fifty-nine books that are now in use We
found bills under date of October 3. 1001 "abso
lutely identifying, these books. . The order we
are looking for consists of seventy-five books
of one kind and thirty of another kind and
was given on August 19. Why did they give
an order for a complete set in August and an
other in October, when these booka last from
three to five years for each set 7 The usual
number used is sixtyâ why did they order sev
enty-five from Oakes? They don't produce any
mortgage books at ail except those in use and.
accordingto the bills, they -were made and pali
for in 1800. We are ready to swear to a war
rant at any time. . .......
I'd like to know who ia behind this. The
whole thing is an Infernal lie. . It is all put
up by my political enemies, and I am golnr
to find out who the man is who is trying to
ruin me. It's another effort on the part of
the Contra Costa Water Company and their
attorneys. Nusbaumer Is doing this for Day
and because he hates me.
Of course, I gave that order. I rave it to
Mr. Oakes because he had been my friend Of
course, hja could not fill the order himself' but
he could- give It to some one else and ha
might make a little commission for himself
As for the cashing of the order the law pro
vides that when an order for work is cfven
the party who receives it can make out a
bill and It can be paid upon the Indorsement
of the official giving the order that the ex
penditure has been authorised. Following the
usual custom and the law I indorsed upon
those bills the fact that I had authorized the
expenditure. It is not my business to see that
the order Is delivered, and the law does not
require that the order shall be delivered before
the bills are passed. It is the work of my
deputies to see that books are delivered and to
receipt therefor. I have no connection with
that and I am assured that these books were
delivered. -We have found most of the books
and I will have the others traced by to-morrow
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton was
content with a general denial of the
charges, but between denials he Inter
jected some editorial opinions about hla
political enemies and gave some very in
teresting testimony in regard to the way
in which work Is paid for by the county
before it is even printed. He said:
DALTON GHOWS ' IRATE.
Therefore, I am glad to say, neither Nus
baumer nor the water company lijtea the En
quirer; and both would be very glad to see the
Enquirer discredited in the public mind. How
ever, both Nusbaumer and the water company
aro well known to the peoplÂ« of Oakland, and
I rather think that Nusbaumer' s connection
with this affair ought to be notice enough to
the Enquirer's friends and the publlo generally
that. If thero is anything crooked in the whole
affair, It is not on the part of the Enquirer.
Again let me say that so fftr as the En
quirer and myself are concerned, there Is ab
solutely nothing In the charges made by Nus
baumer; that Stedman's affidavit Is absolutely
false, so far as It Imputes to me anything that
at all smacks of any fraud or dishonesty that
I shall do all I can to unearth the whole mat
ter and punish the guilty parties; and that
Nusbaumer and his water company masters
cannot, in this or any other way control or
silence the Enquirer In its defense of the peo
ple against .the attempts (bo far successful) of
the water company to rob the people of this
city. . Q. B. DANIELS.
Mr. Stedman has been a trusted employe of
the Enquirer, and If hÂ« haa In any way by his
acts Involved his employers he haa, of course,
done so with malice and probably for a consid
eration. At any rate. I shall do everything In
my power to bring all the facts In the case to
public notice, feeling absolutely sure that
there has been no fraud committed that will in
any way reflect upon the Enquirer or myself.
It will be noticed, perhaps, that Judge Nus
baumer has fathered these charges. It will
also be remembered that Judge Nusbaumer has
been, and probably etill Is, the trusted political
agent of the Contra Costa Water Company.
The Enquirer has always taken occasion to
Ehow up Nusbaumer and the water company
whenever either or both of them has been en
gaged in any nefarious attempts against the
people of Oakland.
In regard to the Nusbaumer allegations of
fraud against Alameda County, I have only
this to say: If any fraud has been committed
I know absolutely nothing about It. and all
connection that the Enquirer has had with tho
ccunty will be found in the books of account In
the Enquirer office.
There was a general sultry feeling in the
air as if there was impending an erup
tion of a political Pelee.
During the day G. B. Daniels printed in
his own paper the following statement of
his position, which he gave out / aÂ£ official
for himself:
When the Courfhouse closed forthe day
day Assessor Dalton and his deputies -were
declaring: that these fifty-eight books rep
resented the unused portion of the Oakes-
Enquirer order for 105 books. Russel R.
Stedman was declaring that they were no
part of that order. Both Stedman and
Bromley withdrew their offer to swear to
a warrant at that stage of the proceed
ings. Emil Nusbaumer was openly de
manding that District Attorney Allen
issue warrants for both Dalton and Dan
iels. District Attorney Allen s=aid that the
investigation had not proceeded far
enough for him to issue the warrants. G.
B. Daniels was abusing his employe, Rus
sel R. Stedman, and intimating that he
had been bought by Nusbaumer to make
the affidavit. Assessor Dalton was mak
ing unkind remarks about Nusbaumer
and asserting that George Oakes, the man
whom he had befriended, had betrayed
him.

M. C. Chapman outlined his connection
with the case in this wise:
I appear as attorney for Mr. Bromley. My
client stands ready to swear to complaints if It
Is proven that the men are guilty, but it has
not yet been 'sufficiently proven In our minds.
If a prosecution arises I shall assist In the
prosecution and will receive a fee for so doing.
Joseph B. Lanktree took this very prac
tical stand:
I discounted that warrant, but don't think
that I made enough out of It. Look how Ionic
I had to wait for my money. I always was
easy. All that I know is that Mr. Oakea had
a properly . authenticated claim against the
county and I advanced him the money. I
don't know whether any books were delivered
or not
And so the matter stands pending fur
ther investigation.

bility. I was not able to do work of any
kind for several years.
"I doctored hundreds of dollars away.
About a year ago I began using Grape-
Nuts Breakfast Food and have so stead-
ily gained in strength and health that
since last July I have worked every day
at collecting for a large company, walk-

Joyed better health for over 20 years than
I do now. I am able to use all kinds of
food, but do not eat much besides Grape-

such blessed health. I took four
bottles of jo nr Compound and consider
myself cured. I am once more in fino

J. B. Wattles of Healdsburg, a member
of Santa Rosa Lodge, has the distinction
of being one of the original founders of
Elkdom. He was one of the number
present at the institution of the order in
1&60 in New York City. At that time the
membership was confined to actors. Dur
ing all these years Wattles has been a
member of the order, and when the lodge
was instituted in this city he cast his lot
with it.
Santa Rosa Lodge was instituted on
February 9, 1901. The work was performed
by District Deputy Frank L. Gray, as
sisted by the team of Vallejo Lodge. Hun
dreds of visitors came from rÂ»**Â«
Oakland and San Francisco to attend ths
ltstivlties.
The building was erected especially for
the accommodation of the Elks by one of
their members, Cornelius Shea. It is the
handsomest hall in this city and has been
fitted by the Elks with an eye to beauty
alone. It is elegantly carpeted and fur
nished and has one of the handsomest
grand pianos erer manufactured. There
is a commodious dining hall just off the
lodgeroom. The front of the building,
which faces the east, contains the large
billiard-room, library-room and parlors,
all handsomely furnished. Special atten
tion has been paid to the acoustic proper
tics and the lighting.
SANTA ROSA, June 4.â Elks' Hall was
dedicated to-night with appropriate cere
monies. It was ladies' nigrht "with the
Elks, and the wives, daughters and
sweethearts of members of the organiza
tion took occasion to visit the meeting
rooaj of the lodge and inspect the quar
ters.

NEW YORK. June 4. â The stock market to
day was still confined to its narrow professional
limits and lacked even the few special features
which varied the monotony yesterday. The gen
eral tone was rather heavy. The losses were
small and were caused by very light selling.
The ostensible explanation of the heaviness was
the report received from the anthracite regions
this morning that some of the coal mines were
suffering from the shutting- down of the pumps.
The rioting in Chicago over the teamsters'
strike had the effect of somewhat sharpening
apprehension over the subject of labor troubles
generally. The effects of the coal shortage
are in the meantime crowing more acute, but
the possibility of the soft coal miners becoming
u'tlmately involved in the dispute is always
kept In mind. This possibility may have ac
counted in part for the rather marked heavi
ness of United States Steel stocks. The de
clftion to maintain the present price of steel
rails for 1903 and reports of large orders al
ready received running Into the next year did
not prevent the selling of United States Steel,
especially of the preferred. The Weather Bu
reau's report of the damage by frost last week
to corn and the delay to the planting of the
crop and its backward cultivation by reason of
unfavorable weather helped on the undertone
of depression. A sharp reaction in Canadian
Pacific after its recent sustained advance had
6ome sympathetic effect on the market. Call
money was somewhat Easier, but held at 3 per
cent or above. Sterling exchange continued to
advance. The firmness of exchange in spite
of the higher rate for call money and the sell
ing by American holders of British Consols to
take profits is attributed to a demand by bank
ers to cover against previous sales of exchange
bills made in the course of borrowing abroad.
The market closed semi-stagnant and heavy.
Bonds were rather more active than stocks
and the price movement was irregular. Total
sales, $2,720,000.
United States threes declined % and the twos
registered % per cent on the last call.

CHICAGO, June 4. â Corn led the action of
all cits and was the center of more interest
than all the other pits combined. The feature
of the day's trading was the clever switching
of the bis bull traders from bulling July op
tions to - active- support of September. This
crowd with its Wall-street af filiations is sup
posed to be lone more than twice the amount
of July stuff obtainable. It has been the talk
of the floor that July was to see a rabid bull
market, and several times adventurous shorts
have been pinched by this contingent. At the
outset to-day many of the bears who had been
selling short for the last four days became
aware that they were a little oVer-confldent,
and on fairly steady cables-, lighter receipts,
bullish Government crop reports and a restricted
interior movement, covered freely,- putting the
prices ud somewhat-. The bull crowd let â¢ in
this movement by supporting July well for a
time. This ootion started %c higher to %c
lower at 61 to til Vic and in a few moments
Jumped boldly. to 62%c. When the market had
a fairly firm basis the bull leaders dumped
large quantities and began talking on Septem
ber rapidly. September sold from 55%c to 58%c
before the crowd realized what was being done.
Then July dipped and fluctuated erratically.
At the close the feeling was tense and the tone
strong. July closed %@%c us- at 61%@61%c,
and September %@lc up at 58%@08?ic. Re
ceipts were 195 cars. Â¦ "
Wheat displayed considerable strength; re
gardless of the stubborn manner in which the
advance was fought by the bears. The local
crowd started the uj)-turn by short covering
large accounts "that resulted from the recent
bearish markets. Laje.the corn bull crowd and
elevator interests were good buyers. .Receipts
were, small, clearances large, Â¦ the cash de
mand Rood and tlie seaboard reported the ex
port business better. The Government report
of croa conditions was bullish. Lower cables
were not considerad bearish because they were
not as weak as expected. The local crowd,
however, put on a bear pressure all day, and
although a natural reaction., came after the
several days' decline, it was only after hard
work bv the bulls, with the assistance of the
corn pit. July opened a. shade to %@%c up
at 71%c to 71Vic, sold to 72c and closed firm,'
%c up, at ,71 7 /4@72c. '
Oats were strong, but the market was far
from active, except . In July. Shorts covered
freely, Influenced largely by the action in
corn, and were firm on bad Â¦ weather. . July
closed strong. l%c up at 381&C. _
Provisions were dull and iistless earlv, but
late In the day. Influenced by the grain
strength and support by packers, good ad
vances were made. The close was strong. July
pork was 15c up, lard unchanged and ribs
27%c hluher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Chicago Grain and Produce.
The Business Outlook.
"WHAT WALL- STREET FINANCIERS
THINK OF CURRENT SITUATION.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The coal strike and the holidays â the lat
ter involving a three days' suspension of busi
ness on the Stock Exchange â acted as a de
cided deterrent upon stock market operations.
A confident undertone appeared owing to the
strong support developed on every recession,
but speculative activity seemed inclined to wait
for more favorable opportunities. Much de
fends upon the . outcome of the strike. If a
prolonged struggle should result, the effect
would be unfavorable to the general market.
If. on the other hand, an early cessation of
hostilities should happen, the market would be
relieved of a weight which bears on other than
the coal stocks.
"Aside from the strike, the most important
Influences on the market are the crop situation,
the money market and peace in South Africa.
ZSeedless to Fay the crop outlook outranks all
of thess influences, even the etrike, which is
only a passing element. Fortunately crop pros
pects are tavorable. The cold snap delayed
agricultural iperatlons somewhat, but did no se
rious injury. Beneficial rains have fallen over
large areas, checking drouth; so that winter
wheat is in improved condition and early spring
wheat 1Â« doing well. A large corn acreage
seems inevitable, the high prices resulting from
last year's shortage having greatly stimulated
planting and driving farmers "corn crary" in
some sections. A repetition of last year's .de
ficiency would be simply ruinous and seems be
yond possibility. The wonder Is that crop losses
made so trifling an impression upon general
business or uixin the railroads, and there is
every prospect that the agricultural classes will
not be called upon this year to endure the losses
suffered last year. Cotton crop reports are also
lavorable in spite of a slight reduction In acre
age.
Â¦'As for the money market.the outlook is more
assuring. Bank reserves are rising owing to
the influx of funds from the interior and a fur
ther contraction in leans. Relief In the 4atter
direction is most needed and most probable.
The great expansion of loans during the last
few months has been chiefly due to the opera
tions of big borrowers and syndicates. Some
of the deals of the latter have been completed
or are approaching consummation, thus releas
ing large sums and explaining to a considerable
degree the sharp fluctuations occasionally seen
:n the loan account. On March 1 loans stood
at the highest point on record, $038, 000, OCX), and
the surplus reserve at $9,975,000. A week ago
loans stood at $870,400,000, a contraction of
*b<. 000,000 in three months, while surplus re
serve had risen to $14,000,000. The latter is
still a rather slender margin considering the
tremendous expansion or" various sorts which
exists, but the tendency is in the right direc
tion and rising reserves may be expected for
pome weeks u> come; unless a rampant specu
lation develops, of which at present there are
no symptoms, except there be a desire for such
on the part of those who have too many stocks
on hand for their own comfort and pleasure.
"A good deal of Interest is shown In the prob
able effect of the cessation of thÂ« Boer war
on the American market. In the long run it
cannot help being beneficial. The first effect,
however, may be for British speculation to
spend considerable energy upon Kaffir shares,
after which it will probably overflow Into Amer
icans. The war has been costing England at
the rate of about $400, 000, 000 a year; and the
release of such vast sums from destructive pur
poses tc -flow again into the legitimate chan
nels of industry and investment must act as a
powerful stimulus that cannot be confined to
the London market. British capital Is always
forced to go beyond its native land, and it is
not at all improbable that the liking for Amer
ican securities may revive in view of the won
derful records they have been making. The
chief obstacle will undoubtedly be foreign
prejudice asa.ir.et American financing.
"Rai'road shares are firmly held owing to good
earnings and the various mergers In prospect.
A feature was the advance in Canadian Pacific,
attributed by some to buying for consolidation
purposes, though this is not confirmed. The
industrials are generally neglected and wisely
eo. More and more o! them are making unsat
isfactory annual reports, notwithstanding the
activity of trade; and it seems only a question
of time when overcapitalization will have to be
wiped out through the old-fashioned methods
of liquidation and reorganization. As the trust
problem premise* to be a vital political ques
tion ere long, the Industrials can hardly be
considered favorite? from either the investment
cr speculative standpoint, j
"When the coal strike approaches a settlement
we may look for a more active market; and if
this is followed by good crop reports and easy
money we may look for better prices. The mar
ket offer* good trading opportunities, there be
ing a fair division of. opinions without settled
tendencies in either direction. The big men
are Ftill persistent bulls on the situation, and If
conditions perrr-it they are sure to use their
influence in that direction. For the present,
however,- the market is a Â«ale on good rallies
end a purchase only on decided breaks."

REDDING, June 4.â The will of the lata
merchant William L. . Smith was opened
to-day and It was found that the entiro
estate, estimated at $113,000, was left to
his favorite niece, Mrs. A. G. Boggs, with,
whom he lived. All other nieces and
nephews are mentioned, but receiva
nothing'.
Mrs. Maggie McKlnney, who was
Smith's close friend for thirty years, is
not mentioned. Sha rays they .were to
have been married - when circumstances
would permit and that she has pledges
which entitle her to a large sharÂ© of tha
estate. She will at once begin a legal
battle, which will be bitterly resisted.

a corporation. Its profits are expended In
the care of its cemetery and buildings. It
will never refuse to bury (If permitted to do
so in its own cemetery) or incinerate a body
If it would distress the living to pay the ex
pense.
As a rule, undertaken discourage crema
tion. We encourage It and believe that cre
mation funerals should be conducted by
friends of cremation. Therefore we built at
No. 420 Golden Gata avenue a place from
whence we Intend to conduct funerals ending:
In cremation.
.We are ready for business. We notified a
carriage company that wa wanted hacks to
go to a funeral at our crematory. We could
not get them. The Stablekeepers' and Hack
owners' Association had passed resolutions
not to drive at our funerals unless we be
longed to the Funeral Directors' Association.
Our manager applied for admission to tha
Funeral Directors' Association of San Fran
cUco and Alameda counties, but was re
jected.
Now, to avoid a boycott over the disposi
tion of the dead, wa declare that we intend
to carry on cremation and prepare bodies for
it. and our patrons will realize a great sav
ing in general expenses, such as. the cost of
cemetery lots, caskets, metallic and. other
useless ornamentation.
1st â We Intend. If we can hlrÂ» them, to
use Dublic hacks only.
2d. â Wa will not own hacks, if we can
hire them.
3d. â We own hearses and horses, but will
house them In any stable that will take cans
of them.
4th. â We will employ union drivers only.
5th. â We will pay union wages to every
person In our employ.
6th. â We will cremate all bodies delivered
to us by undertakers.
7th. â We will not conduct a funeral ending
In Interment
8th. â As to the past: Our crematory, col
umbarium, building on Golden Gate avenue,
â¢were erected by and stone work In our ceme
tery done by union labor, and we propose to
continue along the same lines. If the Influ
ence of -the Funeral Directors of San FranÂ»
Cisco do not prevent It
Oth. â Our charges for cremation: Adults,
$25; children under 15 years of age, $13.

French flag, and, therefore, the parties to
a duel would not, 1 * they contend, under
those circumstances, be amenable to the
laws of the United States.
Now comes the imperial Consul General
of Turkey ln the controversy. One of the
parties to the dispute waited upon that
gentleman and begged that he accept the
position of a second at the duel, which
was expected to take place in the vicinity
of Golden Gate Park yesterday morning.
George EH Hall, the Consul General, lis
tened to all the arguments put forward to
Induce him to accept the position, but
declined the honor with many thanks.
The Consul General therefore may have
to explain to his Majesty, the Sultan, even
the Innocent and unlooked for part he has
played in the drama.
The French Consul will, in the course of
his duty, report the whole matter to his
Government, the official position of the
chief parties to the quarrel making such
a proceeding necessary.

COMMENCEMENT
AT ST. IGNATIUS
But the affair has taken deeper root
than was ever contemplated by those con
cerned in the proceedings, for the French
Consul made no secret of his vexation
over the matter. He has made his feel
ings known to the principals in the affair
and suffers from the fear that the dis
pute in the United States , between an
officer of the French navy arid an official
representing the French Government may
bring ridicule upon that Government.
Representative Frenchmen of the city, on
the other hand, take issue with the French
Consul and declare. that he is wrong in
supposing that the quarrel can possibly
bring ridicule on his Government:

The Administrator of the Marquesas
Islands, having excitedly given vent to
his regrets, hastened to his rooms with
fire in his eye and anger in his heart.
Ensign Rey on the other hand, was
decidedly cool and collected throughout
the day. He received many visitors and
also went out visiting many places of
interest.
Â¦ "M. Rey! poof! poof! poof! I call him
a hog! Ah! It is rediculous. But when
we meet in France, aha! When we meet
in France, then â well, I have told you we
shall see! I can say no more; It would
be a breach of the etiquette of my coun
try. Oh! that we should be on foreign
soil!"
"M. Rey feels, on his side, aggrieved
because of your calling him . a 'hog,' "
was remarked to M. Brisson. Â¦
"I cannot speak of the matter, for It
would be contrary to French etiquette and
custom. I appreciate that we, that is M.
Rey and myself, are in a foreign land and
it is my intention to do nothing here that
would violate the law. However, when
M. Rey is on French ground the matter,
I assure you, will be different. I wait for
that time." - â¢
When seen at the Lick House the very
excellent Administrator of the Marquesas
Islands had this to say:
MATTERS in the controversy be
tween Guy de St. Brisson and
Ensign Rey, told of in The Call
yesterday, have reached a new
phase and no less than three
nations are brought into the heated argu
ments that are in progressâ the United
States, France and Turkey.
First of all it may be stated that M.
Brisson has listened to -and heeded calm
counsel and will allow his wrath against
Ensign Rey to smolder until both parties
shall have reached Paris, when Brisson
will assuredly demand satisfaction from
the naval officer.

It was a glad shout that went up from

Just at that moment the smoke cleared
for an instant and the firemen saw Her
old, with his clothing in one mass of
flames, running wildly toward the brink
of the roof. Captain Bannan called to
him to stop, but Herold was frenzied, and
with a wild yell dashed through the
flames and fell headlong into the yard
fully twenty feet below. In his descent!
Herold narrowly escaped striking the
hosemen who fought their way Into the
rear of the burning building with a pipe
line. Two- of them ran to Herold's as
sistance and hurriedly removed him
through the bakery to the sidewalk It
was at first thought that he had been fa
tally injured in the fall, and all possible
haste was made in getting him to the
County Hospital. There it was found that
while he had been badly burned on the
head, face, hands and back, he had luck

their efforts to find the two children They
called to them, but they either did not
answer or their childish voices were
drowned by the crackling of the burning
wood. The smoke was almost overpower

held to the roof and peered into the haze
for the children. .
LOST IN BLENDING SMOKE.
The terrified children had in the mean
time disappeared in the smoke and Her
old, frantic and half-crazed, called . to
them. They answered him, but he could
not locate them owing to the density of
the smoke. A citizen who was passing the
bakery noticed the smoke and turned
in an alarm from box 2S6, situated at the
corner of Twenty-fourth and York streets.

hood and were quickly on the scene.
While the engine companies were stretch
ing the hose lines. Truck 9 threw a ladder
up against the front wall of the burning
building. The ladder fell two feet short
of the cornice, but did not prevent the
brave truckmen gaining the roof. They
had heard of the peril in which Herold
and the two children stood and knew that
not a moment was to be lost if they were
to save them. The names were shooting
higher and higher and the smoke was
becoming denser, for a quantity of flour

Captain William J. Bannan led the way
over the cornice, quickly followed by Lieu
tenant Ellenberger and Truckmen J.
O'Connor and Henry Morrison. The
crowd that had gathered on the sidewalk
cheered them as they disappeared- in the
smoke, but the cheers they did not heed
Their minds were intent on finding and
rescuing the imprisoned baker and his lit
tle ones.
It is not known how the fire started,
but Herold is of the opinion that the chil
dren were playing with matches. The
storehouse, which adjourns the bakery on
the west side, is a long one-story frame
building about twenty feet high with a
fiat roof. This roof can be reached from a
side window on the upper floor of the
bakery building. The children of late
have been in the custom of playing on
the roof. They went out on it about 11
o'clock yesterday morning, after tiring of
playing in the yard below. Herold was
on the upper floor of the bakery, half
an hour later, and looked out of the side
window to see if the children were on the
roof. To his horror he discovered that
the rear portion of the storehouse was
on fire. The flames were spreading along
the wall and an, instant later a cloud of
dense black smoke poured out from the
storehouse.
Hospital, where he was removed for
treatment, say that fortunately he did not
inhale any of the flames and that he will
recover. But for the quick work of the
brave firemen, who had to fight their way
through lire and smoke to reach them, the
children would have perished.

?W^t u " dersl sned begs leave to heartily
thank his many customers in this city
and vicinity for the confidence and moral
support siven him during the annoyance
and irritation forced upon him by the so-
called "Mayerle & Co.." who unscrupul-
ously opened an office next door and cov-
ered its front with sigrns almost Identical
to mine and also by the use of false state-
ments and specious arguments endeavored
thus to deceive. With the assistance of
the public it has been possible to expose
their dishonest practices which, reacting
upon themselves, have compelled them to
close their place. The people of San Fran-
cisco have once again evidenced the fact
that they .will not stand for underhand"
dealings but are always ready to- support
an institution that has honesty and thor-
oughness for its motto.
The undersigned has been a resident of
San irancisco for many years and upon
the reputation he ha3 built must rest his
future success. To all my old patrons and
prospective customers I beg to assure the
same honest and straightforward treat-
ment that has characterized my past pro-
fessional conduct.

I notice a good many men who wear shirtb

Do 3'ou know you're handicapping your â¢

: such garments as these?
Now, listen to me.

I fit you for a shirt â just one for a starterâ to
show you the difference. I don't want to
