Tha Prince's mission signally failed, If
its purpose was to make the United States

other nation. A high official aald to-day
that undoubtedly the action of Emperor
William was a matter of gratification to
tha President and It had undoubtedly
created a goad feeling which might even

The authorities do not place official cre<t

watch Herr von Holleben's future con
duct with particular interest to obtain
more light upon bis attitude toward thi3,'
country. Herr von Holleben is given
credit for suggesting the visit of Prlnco
Henry as a means of creating a feeling of
friendship between the United States and
Germany. .''..''.''.
The German Government at the time
denied that the Baron had been disgraced,
but the fact that he was assigned to Cal
cutta as Consul General, where he has
only commercial questions to deal with,
while in Washington he waa charge d'af
faires and discussed great international
matters, shows, in the opinion of officials,
the contrary. At the time It was freely
stated that Baron von Sternberg's recall
was due to the fact that he was entirely
too friendly, to the United States. Ilerr
von Holleben is known to have manifested
great interest in the views of the Ger
man-Americans of this country and his
embassy ha3 made reports to Berlin re
garding American naval development.

W., WASHINGTON. March 11.â Since the
publication of the charges of Improper
conduct made by Emil Witte. a former
employe of the German Embassy, against
Her von Holleben, the German Embaa
sador. Washington, ha3 been carefully
scrutinizing the course of the diplomat
from the time he was accredited to thl3
Government. This scrutiny ha3 estab
lished that so far as overt acts are con
cerned the Embassador has done nothing
which would bring abcut his recall. But
some things have come to the attention
of the authorities which show the way he
feels toward the United States. His treat
ment, or at least that of his Government,
of Baron von Sternberg. formerly coun
selor and first secretary of the German
Embassy, has not been forgotten. Baron
von Sternberg was on term3 of close
friendship with Roosevelt when Governor
of New York and Vice President. The
Baron also enjoyed the most cordial re
lations with the late President McKlnley
and Secretary Hay and through his per
sonal efforts many questions of Import
ance existing between the two Govern
ment were brought to an amicable settle
ment. Herr von Holleben went to Ger
many on leave in 1000 and Baron von
Bternbers was left here as charge d'afÂ«

Interior, Generals Castro. and Qrtis and
the troops of their commands left here for
Panama this morning,
General Castro's soldiers report that 800
men on both sides were killed during the
fighting at Agua' Dulce. The revolution
ists lost 550 and the Government forces
250 men. It is also said that the Indian
chief Lorenzo and his half-caste Indians
participated in the attacks and killed
many of the Government soldiers with
machetes. The rifle fire during the Agua
Dulce battle was deadly and persistent.
The din of the rifles was so great that
the cannon fire could not be heard. The
slaughter and massacre at this battle are
described as something awful. The re
mainder of General Castro's com*
mand, which originally numbered 1000
men, have been killed, wounded, taken
prisoners or have escaped.
' Shortly after leaving Harconcitos a
small body of Government troops was
met. These men reported that Colonel
Luque had been .killed In battle February
2 and that the revolutionists were in pos
session of David. General Castro there
fore decided to try to effect the difficult
march across the mountains to Bocas del
Toro. Considering the hardships of the
march, General Castro's troops arrived
there in fairly healthy condition and are
enthusiastic to continue the struggle. The
march from Agua Dulce to Bocas del
Toro occupied seventeen days, during the
last five of which bananas were the only
obtainable food. Drinking -jvater was
plentiful.

eral Herrera will immediately bo made.
General Castro traveled over 300 miles in
cropping the Andes from Agua Dulce to
Bocfts del Tgro. Many of his men died
on this march.
General Castro says he knows positively
that of the forces under the revolution
ary general, Herrera, over 700 were killed
or wounded. He characterized the bra

extraordinary, and said that many of
them were killed within three feet of the
entrenchments.'

PANAMA, March 14.â The' Government
generals, Castro and Ortiz, arrived here
at 11 o'clock thi3 morning and received
one of the most enthusiastic welcomes
ever witnessed In Panama. The crowds
in the streets leading to the railroad sta
tion made traffic Impossible.
i Referring to the engagement at Agusi
Dulce February 20, General Castro told
the correspondents that the Government
troops, numbering 800. men, were attacked
by 2000 revolutionists. On the third day
of the fighting both drinking water and
ammunition in Agua Dulce became scarce
and General Castro ordered his troops to
retreat. To do this the Government forces
had to break through the rebel lines.

PARTY TO THE TREATY.

on Foreign Relations gald recently that
the ratification of this treaty would place
this country In accord niih tim hMltrpt
thought ef the times, and expreÂ«N<?d ..the
hop* that the treaty would receive the
unanimous suppof t of the Senate. These
who ratted questions apropos of the dts*
cusslon disclaimed any intention to pre
vent favorable action.
Senator Hoar also epoke at some length
regarding this provision In the treaty.
He referred to, Agulrmldti'd capture and
eflld that he believed the adoption of the
treaty would have a tendency toward
elevating the conduct of modern warfare.
Senator Burton replied to the inquiry,
speaking especially for General Funston.
and said that he was sure the proceedings
on the general's part had been not only
humane, but that they had been in ac
cordance with the rules of civilized war
fare. It was true, he said, that General
Funston and his force had acted srme
what in the capacity of spies, but what
they had done had been in the lino of
honorable warfare.

WASHINGTON. March 14.-The Senate
spent an hour in executive session to-day
on the convention growing out of The
Hague peace conference relating to the
conduct of war on land and sea, and fin
ally ratified the agreement without a
division. The discussion turned directly
on the conduct of the war in the Philip
pines and related especially to General
Funston's capture of Aguinaldo. Senator
Teller inquired whether, if this treaty
had been in force at the time, the method
of Aguinaldo's capture could have been
justified. He quoted the provision of the
treaty relating to the conduct of epies
and said that he did not mean himself
tc say that General Funston's course
would not have been regular, but merely
To secure the opinion of Senators who
had given attention to the treaty and
who also were familiar with the details
of Aguinaldo's capture.

The Government, Lord Charles added,
ought to purchase coal fields at home and
in the colonies. All warships useless for
fighting purposes or valueless on account
of lack of speed ought to be abolished.
The reserves ought to be reorganized and

of the principal stations Lord Beresford
said he had succeeded, after much ' ob

It appears that the fight upon the Em

months and he is aware of all that has,
been done by his opponents up to the
present time. Now the question is for the
lirst time raised formally as to the pro
priety of an Embassador or Minister en
gaging In business, or even having finan
cial interests in the country to which he
In accredited. It Is believed that there is
no spectic law upon the subject, and It is
suggested that the determining point In
this case will lie in the character of Clay

which they might seem to tend to influ

After declaring that nobody was more
disappointed in this matter than the King
himself, with- whom the idea of this visit
had origlnaated, and after expressing his
own conviction that his Majesty would
have been most enthusiastically welcomed
here, Earl Cadogan said he shared the
full responsibility with the other Minis
ters for advising the King that the pres
ent was not an appropriate occasion for
a^ visit and that this advice was given
after the fullest consideration.
The speaker said he refrained from
characterizing the difficulties which had
rendered the abandoned visit Inopportune,
but. that they were well known and de
plored by a vast majority of the Irish
people, karl Cadogan said he was quite
sure these difficulties were only of a tem
porary character, and that before long his
Majesty would be able to carry out his
wish, which was very near his heart and
tho realization of which would be pro
ductive of the greatest possible advantage
to Ireland.

Following: the termination of the King's
court, an unusual scene was witnessed
early this morning. All the fashionable
photographers of London were. busy tak
ing pictures, with the aid of electric light,
of the^ladles in their presentation dresses.
The diplomatic circle Â¦ included Joseph
H. Choate, the American-'- Erobassador.
and Mrs. Choate; Henry White, secretary
of the American Embassy at London, and
Mrs. White; John R. Carter, second sec
retary of the embassy; William C. Eustla.
third secretary of the embassy, and Mrs.
KusUm; and Commander Richardson Clo
ver, the naval attache. Among the Amer
ican presentations were Mr. and Mrs.
Padelford. Altogether 950 Invitations were
Issued, but a large number of those In
vited â¢ did not attend the court. Mrs.
Choate woro a Worth dress of pink satin
with a train of black velvet, trimmed
with pink rose*.
The newly decorated dining-room, which
is most beautiful, was opened for the first
time this evening. A horseshoe table was
laden with gold plate and pyramids of
flowers and fruit. ' All the arrangements
were highly successful.
Among the striking beauties present
were Lady Cynthia Graham and Vis
ccur.tess Castlereagh. Lady Arthur But
ler, daughter of General Anson Slager of.
the United States army, was also notice
ably pretty. "Witb the exception of those
presented, there were few young girls
present. Lady Strahcona presented Miss
Twining of Canada.
On one side of their Majesties stood a
brilliant group of Embassadora and dip
lomats and ladies displaying gorgeous
dresses ,and jewels: on the other side
stood the members of the royal household.
King Edward received the guests accord
ing to precedence and afterward moved
freely among the Â¦ brilliant company. An
informal supper was served after the re
ception and the court continued until
midnight.
LONDON, March ll.-Kin* Edward's
first evening court nince hi* accession wa*
held to-ulght. The beautiful Â«pring
weather of tho paÂ«t tew day* changed this
afternoon to a heavy downpour, which
continued throughout tho evening and
quite spoiled tho spectacle as far as thd
general public was concerned. The scene
oi' the affair was Buckingham Palace.
In spite ot the . blinding rain, which
turned the roads Into quapmires and hid
tho entrance of the palace in blurred mist,
tho constant stream of carriages was
watched by a large crowd, which cheered
most loyally when their Majesties, In a
state coach and escorted by officers ot
the Life Guards, came along the Mall and
passed into the palace, the guard of honor
giving the rdyal salute and the Grena
dier's Band, stationed In the courtyard,
playing the national anthem.
Their Majesties were bowing all along
the route, but, in common wiUi the occu
pants of the other carriages, they could
scarcely be recognized through the rain.
Once inside the palace the contrast was
striking. Nothing so brilliant has been
seen since the early days of the reign of
Quen Victoria. The blaze of new electric
lights, the scent of flowers heaped along
th e corridors, the glitter of ladles' jewels
and dresses and the court uniforms made
a memorable and magnificent scene. Kins
i-dward s private band played in a gal-
L ei X of the ballroom, where the court was
held. Their Majesties , stood simply and
without a dias at one end of the room and
a few paces in front of the royal circle,
which included the Prince and Princess
oi Wales, while further back were ranged
other royal personages. The breast of
King Edward was blazing: with orders
and stars and he appeared to be in the
best of health and spirits.
Queen Alexandra wore a golden yellow
dress, embroidered with irises. Rows of
pearls hung from her neck and she wore a
dainty diamond crov/n. The Queen stood
throughout the fatiguing ceremony, gra
ciously smiling. The Princess of Wales
was attired in white and silver and the
other Princesses were robed in white.
The Governor further said that Presi
dent Tuttle and the Boston and Albany
omrMals had usM every effort to get the
men back. At Kast BoHton, where ninety
Â°f thÂ« Boston and Maine men went out.
&I had been taken back. At the same
place, where 320 of the Boston and Albany
men went out. 108 had been jrlvcn places
ry the railroad company. In the caÂ»e of
th* Now Haven road, he said, thÂ« com
pany would be willing to take back as
mnny a* ponKible. but the question of re
quiring the men to sign an agreement has
not been arranged.
The situation looks very much more en
counging than last nlsht. The railroads have
ell agreed to take back as many men as pos
fible without discrimination. As far as the
Ft<*amship lines are concerned I understand
that the aien have returned, or practically all
of them. The railroad compani^ will not con
pert to d!ftcharffÂ« men whom they have hired
In place of thÂ« strikers, but they are well dla
posed to the men and are anxious to take back
en many ac possible. The question of the load
ing and unloading of teams, while it came up
incidentally to-day, was not very much dis
cuwicd. It will be taken up next week.
The Governor received many delegations
during the afternoon-and by great exer
tion got together President John M. Hall
of the New York, New Haven and Hart
ford Railroad: President Tuttle of the
Boston and Maine Railroad and Samuel
Hoar, general counsel for- the Boston and
Albany at the State House at 4:30 o'clock.
W. E. Chamberlain, general manager of
the eastern division of the New Haven
road, also was admitted into the execu
tive chamber. The Selectmen were with
the Governor an hour and a half. In the
meantime a number of the labor leaders,
who had been holding conferences with
the State Board of Arbitration and at the
labor Quarters, arrived and were taken
into the Council chamber. For an hour
the Governor had alternate interviews
between employer and employe. The Gov
ernor said to-night:
The special side of the strike-breaking
to-lay presented an army of workingmen
rushing helter-skelter to get to their old
positions. There had been more than 20,
oOO places vacated, but fully 10 per cent of
the men found their places tilled. This
was the reason for friction all day, af
fecting only the men themselves, for the
concerns â¢were too busy raising: the em
bargo on goods in their keeping to give
heed to talk of unfairness. Freight be
gan to move at docks, freight sheds, from
and to wholesale houses and factories and
upon the streets, and by night great in
roads had been made on the four days'
accumulation of eoods.
The real battle to-day was between the
men who control the strike and the repre
sentatives of the great interests who had
been prevailed upon to consider certain
propositions as a way to the settlement
of The trouble.
As a matter of fact, the strike was
completely broKen to-day, although
irouules cropped out In many quarters,
some of which were arranged without de
lay and others dragged along In an uncer
tain state, po that they came In for con
sideration by the labor bodies to-night.
During these meetings, judging from
what was argued by the men, Independ
ent strikes of bodies seem impending, but
the leaders In the strike just ended are
sanguine that they still hold control of
the entire organized labor body and will
r.ot again be obliged to order a strike of
the freieht handlers, or its more serious
accompaniment, a sympathetic strike of
affiliated bodies. To-morrow will show
more clearly the conditions In this respect.
On the other hand, Governor Crane and
Â«he State Hoard of Arbitration belleVo
that the pnililcm Is being solved quite
lapidly, considering the Immensity of tho
em Ike, an<i only asit for time and patience,
irom both laboring and business men, to
remove ail obslucies to a resumption of
Ireijjht traffic under ordinary conditions.

23 First street. Sin Francisco.It is understood that much of the time
was given to an argument by Morris of
Minnesota on the constitutionality of a
rebate. Individually the members, after
the meeting, said that the prospects for
an agreement were good, but that the
form of the agreement was still In doubt,
no one plan, yet haying shown its advant
age over the others. No vote's were taken
at the meeting to-day.
The conferees continued their, discussion
this afternoon. The conference lasted
from 2 until 5 p. m. and at 'its close
Chairman Payne, who had been delegated
by both sides to give out a statement,
said that after further consideration of
the subject the conferees had come to no
conclusion and had adjourned until 2
o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
Â¦ The plan is somewhat similar to the re
bate proposition heretofore presented, ex
cept that this payment is to go direct to
the Cuban Government instead of the
planters.
Representative Â¦ Fordney of Michigan,
one of the conferees, takes this view, and
has favored the conference plan by which
there should be 20 per cent reduction of
the Cuban duties on goods going into
Cuba and in return the payment to Cuba
out of the United States treasury of an
amount equal to 20 per cent of the duties
on Cuban goods coming here. Fordney
holds that this will give the desired relief
without involving a reduction of duty.
On the other hand some ef the conferees
representing the element opposed to 'the
Ways and Means Committee stated that
while an amicable adjustment undoubted
ly would be reached there would be no
consent to any plan involving a reduction
of tariff. '
WASHINGTON, March 14.-Members of
the Ways and Means Committee stated
with positiveness to-day that the confer
ences now in progress would result in a
compromise agreement in the Cuban re
ciprocity issue, probably on the lines of
a. 20 per cent Concession for one or two
years. '
DOUBT HEDGES
CUBAN QUESTION
Those who havo given serious consider
ation to the subject do not anticipate any
action that will* change the constitution
relative to the election of Senators during
the present Congress.
In substance it provides that each State
shall have not less than two Senators and
one additional Senator for every addi
tional ratio of 500,000 neople. Under it3
provisions New York would have about
twelve Senators, Pennsylvania ten and
several bther States would have more
than six each.
Those who are interested In this subject
in the Senate could not help being
amused at' an occurrence to-day in tlas
connection. While William J. Bryan was
in the Senate lobby, talking to certain
Senators In favor of the resolution. Sen
ator Penrose introduced an amendment
to the resolution which virtually kills it
eo far as this session is concerned.
Just outside of the glass door, which
separates the Senate chamber from the
lobby, stood Bryan with his hand on the
shoulder of Senator Bate of Tennessee,
pleading with him to support the resolu
tion. On the other side of the glass door,
within the Senate chamber, stood Senator
Penrose propounding an amendment cal
culated to make the pending resolution
so obnoxious that It may not have con
sideration this session. If Senator Pen
rose's amendment should be accepted it
would provide for a complete alteration
of the constitution and convert the Sen
ate into a second House of Representa
tives. ;V,-

SAN JOSE, March 14.â Henry C. Mar
tin, who conducts a stationery store at
196 South First street, fell a victim to a
trio of thieves this morning, who emptied
his till, taking $20, all there was in it.
Soon after Martin opened the store this
morning a man entered and purchased a
writing pad, tendering a $20 piece in pay
ment. . Martin gave him the requisite
change, placing the gold piece in the till.
A little later two confederates of the man
came along. One took Martin to a show
window to point out a book that he
wanted. While doing so customer No. 1
returned and entered the store. The third
of the trio then appeared and called Mar
tin out to the edge of . the sidewalk to
ask him the location of some business
house. During this time No. 1 robbed
the. till. When Martin entered the store
he saw the man coming from behind the
counter and when asked what he was do
ing there he said he was looking for a
paper. All three men then left the store
and when Martin went to the till he found
it empty. The police were notified, but
the men were not caueht.

PAULS AN EASY VICTIM
TO A TRIO OF THIEVES
Thompson Is staying at a private sani
tarium on the Alameda, : between Santa
Clara and San Jose. Â¦
Thompson arrived here last September
from Chicago, in company with R. P.
Cross of the Chicago firm of Patterson &
Cross, fruit brokers. For a time they
were engaged in putting up prunes in
one-pound packages for shipment Cast.
After a few weeks Cross refused to longer
employ Thompson and the latter went to
Los Angeles. He remained there until a
few weeks ago. Since coming here he has
been in a private sanitarium. While in
Los Angeles he was in a private sanita
rium, which he was induced to enter by
his brother, Payson Thompson, a real es
tate dealer at 47 Borden block, corner
Dearborn and Randolph streets, Chicago.
Thompson's attempt to gain admission
to the. asylum here to-day was due, he
says, to the fact that he had made 'up his
mind that if he were to be hunted wher
ever he went and confined in asylums
where he was Inhumanly treated he would
seek a place that he liked and ask to be
admitted. 0
Thompson says his people In Chicago
keep him supplied with funds. He has
{400 on deposit in a Los Angeles bank and
$100 in San Jose. He had considerable
money with him to-day and offered to pay
liberally any person who would swear to
a complaint charging him with Insanity,
In order that he mlght.be entered as a pa
tient - at Agnews. The young man Is a
good looking, Btrongly built fellow and is
dressed In comfortable, well-flttlngr gar
ments. As he walked away after telling
his story, he remarked: "well, I suppose
I would better keep on wandering over
the world with this dead weight of insan
ity hampering me at every step. Wher
ever I go it is impossible for me to escape
for any length of time the influence that
is making my life unbearable."
After his discharge from Flint he was
placed in* various private --asylums, where,
he alleges, he was treated inhumanly. His
feet were scalded, he was beaten by bru
tal guards and tied in a bed for three
days without attention of any sort. He
says that the treatment he received was
enough to make, a man crazy, though he
.were as wise as Solomon. He went from
one to another Â¦ of these private institu
tions until he came to California.
Thompson says that his- mother and
Mrs. Levi Letter are sisters. His troubles
began when his cousin, . Joseph Letter,
made his famous deal in wheat on Decem
ber 3, 1897. Thompson was aware of the
plans of young Leiter and Interfered by
disclosing information which caused Let
ter's ruin. In retaliation, he alleges, he
was forcibly taken and conveyed to the
insane asylum in Kankakee, 111., where
he remained six and a half months. Hav- 1
ing. as he claims, convinced the managers
of the asylum that he was entitled to
freedom; he was sent to another asylum
at Dearborn, Mich. Later he was re
turned to Kankakee for, two months. He
was then sent to an asylum In Flint, Gen
essee County, -Mich., where he was exam
ined and declared to be sane. Thompson
frankly admits that he previously had
been declared insane by four physicians
and numerous asylum managers. > ;
SANTA CLARA, March 14.- Watta
Thompson, who claims to be a nephew of
Millionaire Leiter.jof Chicago, to-day ap
plied for admission to the State Hospital
for the insane at Agnews. His application
was refused. . â¢Â¦

G. C. Collins of the lumber firm of Hig
gins & Collins of San Francisco was here
to-uay trying to arrange a settlement with
a number of Marston's creditors. It is
understood Marston agrees to pay ail
claims if the bills are accounted 25 per
cent. It is understood 75 per cent will be
paid at once if the creditors agree to ac
cept it. If they do not accept, they will
have to await the outcome of the More
house suit against Marston. Â¦ Collins is
said to have seen creditors representing
$14,000 in claims. Some have agreed to the
terms, while others want time to consider.
SAN JQSE, March 14.â After several
years' anxiety, the creditors of Paul Mar
ston, who for a time was considered on^
of the "swiftest" young men of San Jose,
have been approached by an agent of the
latter with a view of effecting a settle
ment of 'their claims. Marston ia now liv
ing m San Francisco.
Borne years ago while Marston was yet
in his minority his grandmother died in
Maine, leaving him a fortune of about
$400,000. Litigation arose over the-prop
erty and Attorney H. V. Morehouse was
engaged by Marston as counsel. More
house won the suit, and then brought an
action against Marston for his fee, .tying
up the estate. :. â¢
The tying up of the estate brought a
financial crash in the Marstons' domain.
Creditors attached the furniture and cart
ed it away. Many suits were brought and
attorneys were sent back to Maine to see
if Marston's estate could not be â¢ levied
upon, but Morehouse had got ahead of
them. - Â¦ â¢Â¦ J- 'Â¦ Â¦

A Deputy Sheriff arrested Brown Dorns,
an Indian, who was known to have been
in love with the squaw. It is believed he
may have followed the ancient supersti
tion and revenged her death. He protests
innocence and charges the crime to Big
Mouth Charlie. The Indians will give no
assistance to the officers and no testimony
which can be relied upon. They believe
justice was done.
REDDING, March 14.â Alturas and the
large Indian.rancheria near that town are
aroused over a murder that took place' at
the rancheria on Tuesday. The" Indians
are attempting to shield the murderer,
because he shot down a - medicine man
whose patient had died, which is in â¢ac
cordance with Indian tradition. A squaw
had been sick for some weeks. George
Harris, an Indian giant, who possessed
all' the beads and tokens ,and kuew the
incantations of the ancient medicine man,
undertook to cure" v her. In spite of heroic
treatment in the shape of dancing, and
walling she died. ; \
Hams on Tuesday was shot to death
from ambush. It is sid that white men
had to go out to care for the body. His
friends had vanished with the death ot

J^ VER at Berkeley oval Alfred ,W. Plaw, a youth of Fal-

V-r he will be called upon to meet the ' greatest athletes of
the East on the field. ': 'Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦Â»â¢Â¦Â¦ : ;
His specialty, is "hammer-throwing," of which, a great deal
Is heard in these strenuous times. This ; student of the Uni
versity of California gives promise of beating the world, at the
game. He learned the art *from "Tom" Carroll of Frultvale,
who holds all the world's professional records. When any one
displaces a record credited, to Carroll he. goes out> and estab
lishes a new one.
Plaw in street attire or even in the abbreviated costume of
the athlete* would never be picked but for a strong man. . His
muscles of steel are concealed from view, but they are imme
diately below the surface, ready for action. .Just now Plaw
is doing a lot of work to make up for time lost during the
rainy season. ? -- ".
He considers one hundred trials with the hammer' a day's
practice. He does not exert himself each time, but hurls the
sixteen-pound affair an average distance' of 125 feet.., .Some
times he sends it twenty-five feet farther, just to show that he
can d*> it' Some weeks since he let ; out an extra link and
sent the hammer the extraordinary distance of 187 feet 4
inches. John Flanagan's world's .record is 171 feet 1 5 " inches.
The intercollegiate record of 154 feet 4% inches Is .held by Plaw.
This shows his remarkable improvement since last season.
He is still on the" up grade and it is futile to predict the
mark he' will finally set. He has/remarkable control of the
unwieldy implement, being able to place it on any part of the
field. ... .;' . :Y ; .,..:., .. "'â¢{Â¦ ;{.::, ;/>.; Â¦

"Throw.it here,"he shouts, and a moment later the big
ball comes hurtling toward him. He has to move quickly to
avoid being struck. . . Â¦ V
Plaw retrieves the hammer, thus getting a fair amount of
walking exercise duririg the ; time i allotted - for- his practice.
At present he is using the baseball field, that being the only
suitable piece of ground : for the work.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 14.â Continued rainy
weather: for the past month has so hampered work on both
the diamond and track that the Stanford athletes are far be
hind the form they should be in at tfiis season of the year.
With the first intercollegiate baseball game but three weeks
off, the varsity team has shown itself an easy mark for the
Santa Clara College players on three different occasions, and
anything but varsity ball is being played. At present the nine
men playing on the team are not showing theform at the bat
they were earlier in the season. What promised to be a heavy
hitting aggregation is retrograding into a mediocre bunch.
. The. personnel of the .Infield' is far from being settled. Mc-
Gilvray seems to have von the position behind the bat. He
has a good arm for base-throwingr, but is not; a sure catcher.
In the box McFarland, Parker, Frltch and Rowland have been
given, a chance to show their ability and there seems little
choice among them. All of them pitch a fair game, *but Mc-
Farlahd and Parker seem." in the lead. Brown on third and
Captain Cowden at second are the only old varsity men on the
infield, excepting Parker, who was varsity pitcher last season.
Crawford at shortstop plays his position well, although it is
a new one to him. The principal difficulty which Coach Swin
dells has met with is the . securing of a good first-base man.
At present Blake is showing the best form of any of the can
didates, but he is new at the position and his work is uncer
tain. Â¦ Lowenthal, Capp and Knight apparently have cinched
the field positions.
Trainer "Dad" -Moulton held a preliminary try-out of the
track athletes yesterday and was well satisfied with the form
displayed by the men. The first track meet on the campus
oval â¢ will be held on March 22 between the sophomore team
and the Ukiah High School athletes. The '04 team Is consid
ered the strongest team In college and should win the contest.
On Junior Class day, March 28, the annual , interclass field day
will be held, at which-a chance will be given to get a line on
varsity possibilities.

Annual Competition.
Representatives of the Various High
YCTJNG ATHLETES TO MEET
ON BERKELEY OVAL
Stanford has at last hit upon a good
plan of choosing her men for the intercol
legiate matches. A round- robin tourna
ment will be held, from which all team
players of previous years will be excused.
The three men winning the greatest
number of points in these preliminary
matches will be pitted against the team
men of the previous year. Harry Wlehe
is the only man at Stanford who has
played in an Intercollegiate match, and he
is sure of getting a place. The men who
will try for the other two places are
Hooper, Moore, Baker and the Lieb broth
ers. Wlehe has a chance of winning his
match in singles. It is doubtful if he and
any partner he can get can win the
doubles. The other singles match is sure
to go to California. On the whole, Stan
ford's chances this year are not good, but
tennis is an uncertain game, in which the
unexpected often happens.
The handicap singles tournament for
juveniles, held on the Golden Gate Park
courts, are proving popular among the
boys. In the last event of this kind there
were sixteen entries, and some good
matches resulted. A large tournament of
this kind Is being planned for week after
next. The schools will be closed and a
great number of boys will undoubtedly
take part. An enthusiast has offered a
racket as first prize.
Dr. Sumner Hardy Is out practicing al
most every evening now and is fast re
gaining his old form. His brother Sam
made his reappearance on the courts on
Tuesday, but was out of practice and
proved easy prey for Sumner. It is doubt
ful if. either will take part in any cham
pionship events.
Judge Lambkin, a crack player from
Woodland, visited the courts during the
week. The Judge is of the opinion that
the Sacramento, tournament this year
will be the largest and most important
ever held in that part of the State
The University of California will hold
its doubles tryout on the college courts
to-day. It was set for last Saturday, but
had to be postponed on account of rain.
The opposing, teams will be Drummond
MacGavin and Fred Brown, Reuben Hunt
and George Baker. The latter have won
several practice matches from their op
ponents recently and are therefore strong
favorites. MacGavin is easily the best
doubles player in college. Brown, al
though a good man in singles, does not
play at all well in doubles. Hunt and
MacGavin would probably make the
strongest combination. The latter, on ac
count of his superiority in this form of
play, should be conceded a place on the
doubles team.
There will probably be eight or ten
teams take part to-morrow, and unless
Handicapped out of it one of the two
leading teams should win the tournament.
Should Collier and Crowell and the
Smith brothers come together to-morrow
the latter will again receive odds of "half
fifteen." With these odds they won thei
last tournament but by a small margin.
The brothers are entitled to a small
handicap, as Chet Smith is a class below
the other three men.
Cups. These trophies .have been up
for two years and a half, and it begins to
look as if they might finally be disposed
of/ That they wiil go to either the Smith
brothers or Collier and Crowell is almost
a certainty. These two teams have each
won the cups three times, and as there is
no team with its name on the cups once
now in existence one of the two former
teams is almost sure to win them perma
nently. The club members are all desirous
of having the cups disposed of, but do
not seem to favor the plan of letting the
two leading teams play a series of
matches for 'them.
rr^HERE will be a handicap doubles

There will be coursing at Stockton
every Sunday until May 1, when the field
will be- given over to the baseball people.
Coursing will be resumed again about Oc
tober 1. ;â¢'<
George MacE. Malcom's fast young
greyhound Aeolus is in the hospital un
dergoing treatment â¢ for , an injured leg.
If he recovers entirely he will be sent
East to try for the American Waterloo
cup next fall. . . -<.
Dr. F. P. Clark, a coursing enthusiast
of Stockton, was in the city on Wednes
day. Dr. Clark owns Phosphorous and a
number .of other young greyhounds of
promise. He also owns Royal Anne, once
a well known performer heoe.
Palo Alto has recovered from his recent
injuries, but will not be seen in competi
tion for two months yet.
P. J. Rellly has sold Royal Union to a
Los Angeles coursing man. The black
dog should win his share of the prizes
now being offered in the south. :
James Dean's black dog, Cpnnemara,
once the idol of the followers of coursing,
has been lost. While being exercised
some time since he mysteriously disap
peared and no trace of his whereabouts
can be found. It is supposed he was
picked up by some one and is kept under
restraint. "Con" has seen his best days
en the field. ,
"Dr." Rike's promising puppy by For
Freedom-Nancy R-, was killed by a train
at Baden some days since. The dog was
ten months old and weighed sixty pounds.
He was considered one of the best "pros
pects" on the coast.
L. F. and T. W. Bartels of Denver will
send six dogs to Texas from their Colo
rado kennels.
William McCaffrey left for St. Louis on
Thursday with the string of greyhounds
D. J. Healey of Petaluma sold to Ralph
Orthwein. McCaffrey will continue as
head trainer. After a brief stop in St.
Louis he will go to Texas for the im
portant meetings to be held there,
tiisquoc is the star of the kennel and is
expected to .render a good account of
himself.
This spread of the sport of the leash
throughout the country must redound to
the benefit of the men interested
in it here. Inclosed coursing has
reached its highest development
in this State. The greyhounds have
for several years been bred on the most
fashionable lines, being fortified with the
best blood in England. It is to the Cali
fornia breeders the men of Texas and the
Middle West must come when they wish
to secure greyhounds which can win in
any company. They will be impressed
with this idea after the showing tne Cali
fornia dogs will make in the fortneoming
campaign.
J. Li Ross will leave here for Texas on
Tuesday with Fontenoy and Game Boy,
from his own kennel, and several repre
sentatives from the kennel of J. H. Ros
seter. He may also take George Mal
com's Fine Fire. "Tommy" Murname. a
clever little handler of greyhounds, will
accompany Mr. Ross.
It is reported Beacon and Rector may
represent the Curtis kennel in Texas.
NEVER in the history of coursing in
America has that sport been so
prominently before the public as it
is to-day. Throughout the East and Mid
dle West many meetings have been pro
jected and valuable prizes Â¦
In the matter of prizes the Interurban
Coursing Club of Sherman, Tex., takes
the lead. Its president, Cecil A. Lyon,
has announced a sixteen dog stake
for May IS, with $1100 to the winner and
5500 for the runner-up. As the entry fee
is $100 the coursing men are running for
their own money, the cl^b adding noth
ing. On May 30. and June 1 the club will
promote a special stake, in which the
wiriner will receive $250; runner-up $150,
and third $60.
Meetings Are Being Held
Throughout the

Major J. L. Rathbone, who is known as
a patron of all high ciass sports of the
lieid, has consented to judge the competi
tion between the various packs of fox
hounds, which will be one of the features
of the show. It is possible he will be as

Eheimer of the Pacific Kennel League.
Ho Yow, the Chinese Consul, w*ll judge

challenger which was successiully
launched last Saturday afternoon in the
presence of a large number of the best
known yachtsmen of the bay. The work -

Among the yachtsmen who were gath
ered on the Fulsonf-street wharf last Sat
urday to witness the launching of the
challenger the opinion that the ooat will
prove speedy seemed universal. The only
dov.bt ielt is as to whether her great tpr
ward overhang will not cause her t.Â»
pound in a heavy short sea, such as is
cften encountered in the bay during thu
prevalence of the strong summer winds.

Knocks Him Out in the Fourth Round
of a Fight in Kansas
KANSAS CITY. Mo., March 14.âTom
my Ryan of this city to-night knocked
out "Mysterious Billy" Smith of Portland,
Oregon, in the fourth round of what was
scheduled as a ten-round bout in Turner
Hall. After one minute and thirty-five
seconds of furious fighting: In the last
round Ryan landed a terrific left in the
stomach, which was followed so closely
by a right hook on Smith's jaw that it
was difficult to tell' which blow was the
more effective. Smith went down, and
though he struggled hard- to regain his
feet he was unable to do so before the
fatal ten seconds were counted off.
At the outset of the fourth round both
men began to fight viciously. Ryan land
ed several body blows "which seemed to
distress Smith. The latter landed some
stinging blows' on Ryan's kidneys and
neck, but without any apparent effect on
the Kansas City man. Smith made a
vicious swing at. Ryan, which the latter
ducked cleverly. Smith slipped and fell
from tho force of his own effort. He re
mained on his knees seven seconds, rest
ing. The two blows which knocked him
out- were landed two -seconds- after Smita
regained hi3 feet. . During the first two
rounds honors were even. Ryan appeared
in the pink of condition, while Smith
seemed too heavy.

VOTING GIBBS of Cleveland, Ohio,
was given the. decision over Mose
La Fontise in a tiftecn-round bout
which went the limit last night at
the -Acme Club, Oakland.
La Fontise displayed remarkable recu
perative power. He was unable to get
inside the guard of Gibbs, who jabbed the
Montana fighter with straight lefts all
through the fight. The Ohio boxer put
La Fontise down twice in the tenth round
for eight seconds, but the Montana man
was up and at it when the gong sounded
the end of the round.
La Fontise inflicted but little damage
on Gibbs, as the latter was too clevej".
Gibbs having fought here three tiroes waa
picked by the Oakland contingent as a
winner. During the progress of the fif
teen rounds La Fontise took tho count
five times. He appeared stronger at the
wind up than during the middle of the
battle. Gibbs had him in distress on the
ropes numerous times, but. try as he
would, he could not plant a knockout
punch on any part of the Montana fight
er's anatomy. La Fontise assumed an
awkward, crouching position when In ac
tion. His favorite method of attack was
to rush in and swing with his right for
the body. He played for Gibbs' stomach,
and in the fourth round landed a couple
of jolts that shook the colored boxer uy
and made him stand away to recover his
wind. Gibbs' reach, height and skill were
all against the Montana fighter.
There were two preliminaries to the
main event of the evening. The first was
between Kid La Valle and 'Cyclone Kelly.
In the -fourth round La Valle's seconds
tossed up the sponge, as their man- was
being battered about and unable to defend
himself. The second preliminary was a
six-round contest between Jack Kane
and Jimmie Reilly. both of San Francisco.
It was a rattling go and lasted the full
six rounds. Referee Jack Kitchen declared
the mill a draw and his decision was weJl
received.

owned in Montana, came close to tapping
the wire first with 100 to 1 about his name
in the ring. There was a large crowd
present, and the betting was the best for
days. u :Â¦.
A crack bunch of platers faced the bar
rier in the fourth number over six fur
longs, furnishing one of the best betting
problems of the season. Nash Turner
had the mount on The Pride, but this did
not prevent Princess Titania closing fa
vorite at odds, of 3 tol. The latter mare
was unfortunate as usual at the start,
getting away poorly, and finishing outside
of the money. True Blue made the pace
to the stretch and then retired. Just as it
looked as though the Montana rider,
Spargus, might land Pope Leo first, Blr
kenruth on Sweet Tooth came with a rush
on the Outside, disposing of the outsider
by less than a length. Cut off near the
paddock, Princess Titania lost the show
to School for Scandal.
Elmwood farm's brown Tiger colt, Tho
Forum, had shown some smashing fast
work at Ingleside-, on the strength of
which; he was made favorite for the first
two-year-old dash. Troxler, who had the
mount, got the worst of a straggling
start and, after closing up lengths of day
light, lost to Clarinette by two lengths.
Fire Dance was third.
Tufts, the 2 to 1 second choice for the
seven-furlong selling affair, showed to be
pounds the best of the six starters, that
Is, considering- the lack of staying quali
ties displayed by Dulcimer and Estado.
Stuart had to tramp around the bunch
with Tufts; and then beat Lento, a 15 to
1 shot, handily. Dulcimer, .the favorite,
died away after leading to the stretch.
Winnie O'Connor's mount, Ora Viva,
had first call for the second two-year-old
spin. Away none too well, the youngster
ran third. ; Ransch on Donamt, a son of
Herald,' led from the jump, getting home
two lengths before J. H. Bennett.
i KIckumbob scored a fluke win In the
mile, selling, affair. He was backed from
12 down to 8 and was not headed after the
barrier went up. Bangor finished second
and Herculean third. .
Lady Sterling stood a game drive in
the final seven-furlong run, finishing first
a neck in front of Huachuca. /At the head
of the stretch she looked beaten, but
Quiet and Huachuca both backed up
badly the last eighth, and the Bell entry
outstayed them.

members of the' booking fraternity

HURRAH! the circus' is in town!"
was the cry last evening of the
small boy and his little sister.
Norris & Rowe's aggregation
of ponies, trained dogs, monkeys,
elephants, camels and other animals at
tracted thousands of sightseers as the
parade wended its way through the prin
cipal streets to . the accompaniment of
bands, colored (lights and skyrockets and
the cheers of the onlookers.
The start was made from the Me-'
chanics' Pavilion at 8 p. m. and the route
covered by the parade was along Market
street, Kearny, California and Grant ave
nue and back Market street to the start
ins point.
The display won the approval of the
long line of spectators. _. ..The. mounted

The zebras marched along- in dignified
manners despite -tfj^remarks-^that.; they
"were doing .tlme'V-iflhJ: account'. of "ihcir-
stripes. The clowns presented novel acts
of "rough-riding" and the elephants ac
cepted gifts of peanuts galore without a
hint from their trainers. Some of the
ponies were so small that they were al
most overlooked by the spectators, while
the camels and dromedaries did not seem
.t$>mind the "guying" of the crowd.
i^Every circus wagon had its load of
trained dogs and they sat up with the
air of dignified artists. The parade. was
a' : long one and the fine appearance of
,thÂ© animals won plaudits all along the
route.

RESULTS OF FRIDAY'S RaGINGYM-M OAKLAND TRACK
THE home-and-home tournament be
tween teams representing class B
of the , San Francisco and Oakland
Golf dubs is off.
Half of a 3G-hole match was played last
Saturday on the Oakland links, the Oak
landers, obtaining a lead of 3 up. The sec
ond half was to have been played this
afternoon on the Presidio links, the scores
made .on the . two days; to be counted to*
gether. Early in- the week Leonard
Chenery, captain of the San Francisco
team, suggested to J. O. Cadman, captain
of the Oakland team, that they select a
cup to be given to the winning team.
Captain Chenery's understanding was
that the result of one 36-hole match, halt
played on the Oakland and the other halt
on the Presidio links, was to decide lh*>
ownership of the trophy. But Captain
Cadman insisted the cup should go to
the team winning ' two out of three 18
hole matches, no matter by how many
or how few holes. According to this un
derstanding the Oakland team would alÂ«
ready be one match to the good and it
the Presidio men should win 30 up oi>
their own links that would count but
one game to them, thus producing a tie.
which would be 'decided by an 18-hole
match on neutral links. Captain Chenery
called In S. L. Abbot Jr., captain of tho
San Francisco Golf Club, and offered to
submit the matter to arbitration, or to
agree upon a fresh understanding, but
the Oaklander said he had understood the
matter in a certain way and the tourna
ment must be. played out In accordance
with his views or not at all. Captain
Chenery offers to finish the contest ac
cording to the same rules as class A
tournaments, but Captain Cadman will
have none of it. He will not follow the
precedent set in the annual class A Inter
club tournaments, in which two 36-hole
matches are played and in the event of
each club winning one a deciding: 15-hole
match Is played on neutral links. He will
not let the contest be decided by the re
sult of one 36-hole match, as was done
last year, In which class B teams rep
resenting the two clubs played for the
first time. He will not submit the ques
tion to arbitration nor consent" to any
thing except that his own views shall con
trol. Under these circumstances there
seems little prospect of a mutual under
standing being reached.
Last Sunday the second match in the
first round of the competition for the
council's cup was played between H. C.
Golcher and Charies Page, the former
winning, 7 up, 6 to play. S. L. Abbot Jr.
beat Dr. C. J. Decker. 1 up. The match
between Warren Gregory and G. B. Cook
sey has not yet been played. One match
of the semi-final round has been played,
H. r C. Golcller beating Dr. T. G. McCon
key, 4 up, 2 to play, and winning his way
Into the final round. The winner of the
Gregory-Cooksey match will play against
S. L. Abbot Jr. In the semi-final round.
The tournament over eighteen holes,
match play, for ladles' foursomes of the
San Francisco Golf Club did' not take
place last Monday morning, but Â¦will be
played next Monday, March 17. It is
stated that three couples have already
been drawn, Mrs. R. Oilman Brown with
Miss Alice Hager, Miss Alice Hoffman
with Miss Edith Chesebrough and Miss
Florence Ives with Miss Sarah Drum. If
this be so,' Mrs. Brown and Miss Hager
would seem certain to win, as they were
the Â¦winner and runner-up respectively in
the last competition for the council's cup
for women, during the earlier rounds of
which each beat her opponent by ample
margins.
The recent heavy rains have played
havoc with the . putting erounds of the
Sausallto Golf Club, which will have to be
remade before they can be used. They
must be filled In with new material, rolled
and leveled. The directors of the club
held a meeting on Tuesday night at tie
house of the president. Major -T. "W. M.
Draper, by whom, they wero entertained
at dinner.

Delaney. "Jim" Morley and Brink left
to-night for San Francisco. The latter, it
Is said. 5s prepared to guarantee the fight
ers 520,000.
The action of the Supervisors' Police
Committee at its meeting on Thursday
gave the local promoters food for
thought. The committee decided to rec
ommend that the club receiving the per
mit be reaulred to pay not less than 55000
to some charity. The promoters claim
this would be prohibitive, as no club could
afford to pay any such sum out of its
share of the receipts.
Jeffries and Delaney seem to favor Lob
Angeles, according to the following:
LOS ANGELES, March 14.â Billy De
laney of Oakland, Jeffries' trainer, is in
Los Angeles. In speaking of the probable
scene of the coming championship bout,
Delaney said:
"I did not at first consider Los Angeles
a factor in the race, but since coming
here and looking over the field I have
changed my mind. 1 have suggested to

business man represent them at the open

John Brink will therefore go north,
backed by a big bid. Personally, I would
be glad to see Los Angeles get the fight.
I think it would draw $50,000 In this city.
While our side is agreeable to Los An

stumbling block."
The consensus of opinion has been that
the fight would be held in this city. For
a time Louisville was thought to be a
factor in the contest, but the authorities
stepped in and drew the line at heavy
weight fights.

ThÂ» Secretary believes the price of
bonds is undesirably high and that the
effect of the Government being perma

lie!ps to maintain this price, to the preju
dice of national bank circulation. Banks
are said to be retiring circulation as rap
idly as possible, presumably for the pur
pose of selling the bonds new on deposit
nt present prices, or for the purpose of
using them with the treasury as security
for Government deposits. In making
Government deposits the Secretary is dis
posed to discriminate in favor of such
banks as maintain their circulation and
by these two methods he hopes to over

THE Bay City Club was suspended
last night by the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union and
will not be 'able to hold amateur
boxing exhibitions until reinstated. Action
in the matter was taken at a special meet
ing. The Bay City Club had persisted In
violating the laws of the association, and
the suspension was the unanimous verdict
of the delegates from the various clubs.
Manager Crowley of the Bay City Club
vras there to plead in behalf of his or
ganization, but his efforts were futile.
The evidence against the boxing club wag
too strong and he was unable to refute it.
It was admitted by Mr. Crowley that Rob
tie Johnson, the bantam-weight boxer,
had told him_ an untruth when he stated
he had not 'received more than $35 for
taking part in preliminary contests to
professional fights. Mr. Crowley denied
that his club had given money to ama
teurs and appealed to the association to
give his club an opportunity to show that
in future it would live up to the rules.
.The meeting was called to order by
11-esident W. B. Hinchman. After Secre
tary Hauser had reported various mat
ters George James, a delegate from the
Olympic Club and chairman of the com
mittee on registration, read a lengthy re
port, in which he told of the dereliction
of the Bay City Club in permitting Rob
bie Johnson, a suspended amateur, to
fight oefore the club. He said the com
mittee had imposed a fine of $25 on the
Bay City Club for its action. He dwelt
at length on the assistance given the
committee by the Board of Supervisors.
Upon motion of Secretary Hauser the
rules were suspended and the delegates
took up the report. " A motion was made
to suspend the Bay City Athletic Club.
Manager Crowley then addressed the
meeting at length, and when he concluded
Mr. Rothkopf moved that a secret ballot
be taken. This was defeated by a vote
of 13 to 2. The vote to suspend the Bay
City Club was carried unanimously. The
delegates from the San Francisco and
Kayes Valley Athletic clubs declined to
vcte.
H. H. Herdman was appointed commis
sioner of athletics in the Northwest. Dave
Atkinson, the Reliance football player,
who was suspended for striking an um
pire, asked to be reinst ated, but the mat
ter was referred back to the registration

safety, speed, luxury and satisfaction. He found in
the abstention of Government from interference with
the enterprise and personal affairs of the people the
greatest growth the world ever saw, and he found
here his countrymen risen in a larger liberty and
completing their characters and rounding out their
lives upon a sturdy German foundation to an extent

During all his sojourn he made no break. Aware
of the cosmopolitan nature of our population and
the many contacts of our foreign relations, he never
by word or manner touched the prejudices of the

our resources, and of our transportation as related to
the development of the country. While it is true that
we also are to a degree ignorant of Europe, that lack
of knowledge is not as marked. This is because we
liaxe received immigration from -every European
country,' and the immigrants have-not only brought
with them knowledge of the locality whence they are
transplanted, but American curiosity is piqued to
know all ibout the country of the strangers who set

Americans travel in Europe to one European who
travels in the United States. These travelers bring
back knowledge of the lands they- visit. Though we
poke fun at our fellow citizen who begins conversa

fact that he gives us knowledge even if we' profess to
be amused by him.

faculty for observing, zn unfailing good humor, and

gress provide for its construction.
Senator Hanna asked for delay on the ground that
the Colombian Minister has probably been detained
by untoward circumstances, and that it would be no
more than fair to wait until he had an opportunity
to state the position of his Government with respect
to the Panama route. There is no apparent reason,
however, why he cannot make his statement after
the bill is before the Senate. It is certain it will not
pass that body in a hurry. _'
During the conference which resulted in the vote
to report Senator Morgan, chairman of the commit
tee, stated that he had been informed by Secretary
Hay that there are no negotiations "in progress be
tween .the United States and Colombia concerning
the Panama route, and that the new. Minister from
that country has not yet even presented his creden
tials, so there' is no telling when negotiations may
begin. On the other hand t"he representatives of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica have been in consultation
upon the subject and have agreed upon virtually all
the points to be covered in the concession treaties,
hardly anything in fact remaining to be done except
to put the agreement in writing. The Secretary had
added the further information that the governments
of the two countries had manifested a disposition to
make all concessions 'the United States could ask.
The supporters of the Nicaragua route can hardly
be accused of undue hasi<i or of trying to rush their
bill through the Senate. The matter has been under,
consideration f6r years. It will be subject to a pro
longed discussion in the Senate and ample oppor
tunity will then be afforded to bring forward any
amendment that may be desired. # It is, therefore,
nothing more than right that the issue be
brought before the Senate as speedily as possible. It,
is the well nigh unanimous desire of the American
people to have, the question settled at this session of
Congress, so that wrork may begin. As a matter of
fact, Congress has been talking about the canal for
more than a half-century, and it is time to take ac T .'Â¦
tion.
WHILE the vote by which the Senate Com
mitfee on the Isthmian Canal decided to
report the Hepburn bill to the Senate does
not in itself indicate that the Nicaragua route will
be adopted by the Senate/ it nevertheless shows that
the advocates of that route are eager for action, while
their opponents are seeking delay. Moreover, as the
vote stood seven for an immediate report to four
against it, there is at least a show of reason for be-,
lievingthat r6iite will command a majority when the
final vote is taken. â¢: '. , ) '. v.
A recent dispatch from Washington says that Re
publicans as well as Democrats in that city are < of
the opinion that New York is going to be the most
important battlefield in the Congressional elections
this fall/and that it is_by no means impossible it
may elect ~a Democrat to succeed* Governor
Odell. New York is never a sure State for either
party/and is likely to make extraordinary flops from
one side to the other. In 1872 Grant carried the
State by 53,000 plurality,. but two years later Tilden
carried it by 50,000 and became .the Democratic
candidate for the Presidency. Cleveland had a simi
lar experience, and it is not by any means sure there
may not be a repetition of the flop this year. .
These facts render the New York situation a mat
ter of national importance and enable Hill to loom
above Bryan on the political horizon: When the
South breaks away / and follows New York the
strength of Bryanism will vanish, for he has little or
none in thj West. It appears, therefore, that the
period of Populist supremacy in the Â¦ - Democratic
ranks is. about over. Bryan may as well: make his
plans to reorganize the Populist party. Democracy
has no further ; use for him, Â¦
SOME time ago The Call directed attention to
the fact. .that -there had been introduced into
the Mississippi Legislature, a? resolution "de
claring that, the Democracy of the 1 South should
j unite with that of the North and the East instead of
following any longer the leadership which' in two
Presidential 'campaigns "has solidified those 'sections
against Democratic candidates rand ..caused -their
overwhelming: defeat.";'? TheV.resoluticrt ,was evi
dently t held^^r consideration' for a' long' time;; for
}\ :'?â¢ Â«oen|ly|that^^^new^lia's]com^;bf |ls adop
*i on \ > Ia the- end^t; was carried.'with a; vigor, which
atoned for the delay in taking a vote on it. The
dispatch says: , "It was adopted by an almost
unanimous vote, amid great excitement. The mem
bers of the House mounted on their desks, waved
their hands and yelled themselves hoarse.".
This declaration from the extreme South gives
strength to the movement now going on in New
York to recover the leadership of the party. It also
gives an increased public interest to the plans of the
New York leaders, for it seems <o assure to them
the domination of. the Democratic party in the next
national campaign. The efforts of Hill and Nixon to
bring Tammany and the State Democracy into har
mony are therefore significant of something more
than State politics.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A "SNATCH-PROOF" purse has Just appeared in Paris. It is in leather, long
and narrow, easy to clasp in the hand, and around it is a. strong strap
attached to a solidly fastening bracelet.
So even if the thief snatches at the purse he cannot detach it froru
the strap, which holds it solidly to the bracelet When not in the hand the j
purse^ hangs to the wrist, so that the forgetful woman need no longer fear leav- '
ing her purse on the table.
Such an adventure has befallen a well-known American woman, who went to .
be fitted in a great dressmaking establishment. She laid her purse on the dress
ing table. It was in gold and well filled with money. She left the room, for- !
getting the purse. Five minutes later she returned for it, and, although only
four people had entered that roomâ the head of the establishment, â¢ th'e fitter,
the premiere and the American womanâ the purse" could not be found. Another
American woman was luckier. Having laid aside her rings, she went off and !
forgot them after her fitting. Later in the day she remembered them and went
back to find them. The effort was vain. Several weeks afterward the chief
of the establishment where she had been fitted sent her an urgent note begging
her to come at once to his house, as her jewelry had. been found. " She went.
Upon arrival she was met by a Catholic priest; the head of the establishment
and the premiere. . ...
The priest told his strange story as he handed her back her lost Jewelry. It
had been remitted to him in the confessional by a woman who declared she be
longed to the fashionable world, and had entered the fitting-room shortly after
the rings had been left there. The temptation to take them was too strong. She
yielded, but remorse seized her, and she sought the priest to return them, in
order that none of the little employes about the dressmaker's establishment
might be accused of the*theft. â¢ ,

The life of the late Marquis of Dufferin
and Ava, by C. IL Black, which the
Messrs. Atchinson' are' about to publish,
has been a long tfme in preparation. In
deed, the distinguished diplomatist re
vised the greater part of the work before
he was stricken down by his fatal illness.
Black was one of Lord Dufferin's most
intimate friend3, and consequently has
been able to supply many details in his
brilliant career which were omitted neces
sarily in the brief obituary notices of the
newspapers.. The volume -will contain a
large number . of illustrations, together
with a portrait. - '
A few years ago the Lenten season
was certain to affect materially the sale
of novels and to call forth a correspond
ing increase in the demand for theological
books. Such influence has been felt but
little this year. The sale of book3 strictly
pertinent to the season has been almost a
negligible quantity.
The demand for book3 on the campaign
in South Africa has also quite fallen off,
while handbooks on the new game of
ping'-pong are having a tremendous sale.
Earl Ronaldshay has lately completed
a book, to which" he gives the title of

his perilous crossing of the Himalayas in
the middle of -winter. The second portion
of the book describes an overland journey
from Simla to -London, by way of Quetta.
Seistan, Meshed and. the Caspian. The
volume is to be illustrated with reproduc
tions of photographs taken by Lord Ron
aldshay. It will be published by Black

Such an official cannot be re-elected. Should he* be nominated he would. split the
party and weaken the whole ticket. The strength of the Republican press of the. State is
against him. The Republican sentiment of his own section is against him. Even.' a ma
jority of his neighbors* are against him. The opposition to him is well founded and will
not cease should he be nominated. Stanch and true Republicans in California do not vote
for "yellow dogs" even in years that promise a walkover. The renomination of" Gage
will mean defeat for the party. That is the situation, and it behooves the rank and file of
the party to heed it. The scheme of the bosses must be baffled and beaten. '* Â¦Â¦.'; ' Â¦
That Gage will be repudiated if nominated is beyond question. 'His" record; is be
fore the people, and it is not the -kind of ; that wins popular support.' From the
moment he entered office he has been the willing tool of EEeFriri and â¢ of- Burns. His. ap
pointments to office have been made at their dictation Or recommendation. Upon them
and their henchmen he has conferred not only all the customary spoils of politics, but he
has made official positions in such institutions as the State Normal' School at San.ljose
and the Home for Feeble-Minded Children a prey to worthless politicians .for the sake ot
adding to the spoils. In fact his whole career from the time he began by seeking to force
a Republican Legislature to, elect Burns to the Senate, down to'this time when he is,seek
ing to force a renomination for himself, has been that of an ally, of the bosses â a -tool of

It is the common Impression amongpoli
ticlans or public men in Pasadena that
ex-Governor Markham proposes to lend
his influence to the support of Thomas
Flint. It is quite well known that he is
not going out of his way to sound the
praises of Gage. With a view of dispell
ing doubt as to Markham's attitude, the
"Growler" of the Pasadena Star sought
for a Markham rise and got it. The ques
tion, "Under Which King, Benzonian?"
was breezily handled by "The Growler"
in this style:
Los Angeles and Pasadena, however,
are cities in the mandatory class, and
delegates must be chosen according to the
manner prescribed in the law. In Pasa
dena Assemblyman W. S. Melick, editor
of the News; ex-Governor Markham,
Postmaster Woods, ex-Senator Simpson,
Benjamin Hahn and the editor of the
Star may come together and put up a
neutral slate to avoid a conflict on the
Gubernatorial question, but a square flght
at the primary polls would probably re
sult in the deiVit of the Gage ticket.
Governor Gage will be forced to make a
strong tight in Los Angeles to lessen the
resistance to his programme in the State
Convention, but his managers are count
ing on electing programme delegations in
the boss-ridden districts of San Francisco,
Sacramento and Santa Clara to overcome
the loss in the south. The State Central
Committee will be expected to attend to
the work of having Gage delegations ap
pointed by the party "governing bodies"
In counties where the primary election
law is not mandatory. As the primary
law is mandatory In only twelve cities of
the State the field Is quite extensive for
outside manipulation In favor of the pro
gramme.
Anti-Gage Feeling Is Pronounced.
Hitherto Los Angeles County, by the
numerical strength- and unity of her dele
gations, has been able to swing Into line
all the forces south of Tehachapi, but the
anti-Gage feeling is too pronounced for
any such concentration in support of the
Governor's renomlnatlon. In the country
districts the farmers and fruit growers
do not entertain a friendly feeling for the
Governor. In the agricultural districts
south of Tehachapi the Gage supporters
are "few and far between."-
The Central Flint Club, with its mem
bership of 1000, will certainly wield a pow
erful influence in the choice of men to
represent Los Angeles in the State Con
vention. When business men, who are out
of politics so far as offlce getting is con
cerned, are asked to account for the re
action in public sentiment they reply that
the Governor has ignored every true In
terest in the south and given his time and
attention to the care and protection of
low 7 grade politicians. It is said that the
formation o/ Flint clubs i3 not significant
of an enthusiastic demand for Flint's
nomination, but does signify an earnest
appeal for the nomination of a candidate
other than Gage.
Governor Gage will not be able to bring
to his aid In the Republican State Con
vention the support of a solid delegation
from Los Angeles County. Indications
multiply that tho Republicans . who aru
against machine methods and boss domi
nation will elect a majority of the dele
gates in that county. Several of Gage's
supporters admit on tho quiet that he
cannot do better In Los Angeles than
"break even.". The opposition to Gage's
rcnomlnation is taking the form of a large
enrollment of Republican voters in Flint
clubs. At the outset ward clubs wero
formed. The earnest support given to the
anti-machino ; campaign by property
owners, merchants and worklngmen of
the party encouraged the leaders of the
movement to provide for the organization
of a central club of 1000 members.

POSTUM CEHHAI* '
AN EVENTFUL DAY
When Coffee Left the Household.
"I never began to use coffee until after
I began teaching scliool, then a good,
motherly old dame served Buch nice cof-.
feÂ« that ehe got tne Into the way of drink*
Ins It.
"Inside of a year I became a wreck
from Insomnia and nervous prostration.
Every afternoon I was so drowsy and
filled with apprehension that I would have
crying epclls without knowing why.
"I lay around the house In misery, and
was a misery to every one else. Once in
a while a friend would tell me that cof-
feÂ« was the cause of my trouble. I rea-
soned with them that I only had one cup
at breakfast and that was not enough to
cause the trouble, but I found that that
was the secretâ that one cup of coffee.
"It was an eventful day in our house-
hold when I quit coffee and started mak-
ing Postum. I followed the directions
and the result was wonderful; no other
words express it The Postum Coffee
was of a rich, beautiful color, and Vhen
cream was added looked as delicious as it
tasted.
"A doctor who was in the house tasted
; the Postum and said that it was equal to
the beet Mocha, or Java, then quickly
turned away as though it was incompre-
hensible. He suspected there was coffee
In it, but I have been assured of the ab-
solute purity of the Postum and have con-
fidence in it.
"Nothing ever tasted better to me than
that first, well-made cup of Postum, and
never since have I tasted coffee, and I
now look back with horror upon the
sickness it caused. We began, very
quickly, to see the difference between my
condition under Postum and under com-
mon coffee. I lost that feeling of de-
spair and restlessness which oppressed
me every afternoon and I began to sleep
like a baby.* Postum must be given the
credit for all my improvement.
"A word about tea also. One time when
1 was visiting I had a package of Postum
with me. It gave out and before I could
get another I had tea for breakfast. With-
in a few days the old wretched feeling
that coffee used to give me camÂ© back,
and all through the long afternoon I felt
that I must weep and weep, though really
over nothing at all.
"Insomnia came back, but I quickly quit |
the tea and gc.t all right again." Name !
given by Postum Co.. Battle Creek. Mich. J
Postum is an absolutely pure product
of *he cereals as analyzed by some of the i
best chemists in America and passed upon .
by the various pure food commissioners
of the different States. >

Brewer began his stock operations
about eighteen months ago, when he was

and closed with Lincoln's admonition
against the tendency to place man on an
equality wgh money.
John' Plover was the third speaker for
Hastings. He held that the standard of
living had been greatly raised under trust
organization. He t made the point, that
combinations of capital do not necessarily
mean monopoly. He said combinations
must prove to be uncontrollable before
they could.be said to be evils rather, than
benefits. '.'â¢;â¢Â¦; ' Â¦ . â¢
John Wright was Nevada's first speaker.
He showed the weight of popular and
scholastic opinion to be against the* trusts.
He pointed out that the affirmative was
basing its argument on dollars and cents
and placing financial considerations above
social welfare.
Walter Cole, for Hastings, argued that
low prices, high wages and industrial de
velopment were due to modern combina
tions of capital.
Louis Dreher opened the contest for the
law college/ He outlined . the, contention
of his team, and dwelt upon. the economy
of production under the trust system. He
held that overproduction and the waste of
competition were qt inestimable benefit to
society, and that the weakness of organi

of wages or raising of prices."

The police are puzzled over the conduct
of a man with a green overcoat, who en
tered Sterling & Ruiz's saloon, at 604 Mis
sion gtreet, about 1 o'clock yesterday
morning and went straight through to
the yard in the rear. As he did not re
turn Ruiz went to look for him, but only
f,ound the overcoat, which was lying on
the ground.
Policeman J.' A. Ryan was notified and
he discovered that the stranger after
shedding his overcoat had climbed the
fence and had forced open the rear door
of Ellis Bros.' restaurant, 6Q2 Mission
street, walked through the . kitchen and
dining-room, unlocked Â¦ the front door
and walked out into the street without
touching anything. In the pocket of the
overcoat was found a card of W. L.
Ward, a Chinatown guide. Ward was
taken to the saloon, but Ruiz said he was
not the man with the overcoat. Ward
was at a loss to account for the fact that
one of his cards was in the pocket of the
overcoat. . Â¦

Colonel George French, who is in com
mand of the Pacific Coast division of the
Salvation Army, stated that so far as ne
knew Brewer and his associates had not
tried to disp&se of any of their stocks on
this coast among the members of the Sal
vation Army."
"These men," said Colonel French,
"have never been stationed out here and
do not know the members of the army on
this coast. "When I was in New York It
was generally known that Brewer and
those now with him were dabbling in
mining and oil stocks and trying to sell
them to members of the army. Comman
der Booth-Tucker called them to account
and they promised to give up the specula
tions. They did not do so and were forced
to resign.^ â¢ Â¦ â¢
"I have not received an official warning
from Commander Booth-Tucker as to tho
operations of Brewer and those associated
with him, but I am likely to. I should
certainly warn any one from having any
dealings with the mining and oil compa
nies promoted by Brewer after reading
the statement issued in the East by Com
mander Booth-Tucker. I heard that six
months ago, Brewer was negotiating to
secure land in the vicinity of the oil
properties In this State.' I do not think
that Brewer or. the men associated with
him will try. to sell any of their stock to
the members of the Salvation Army on
this coast, as they are not acquainted
with them.

Dr. Levingston was an eminent physi

bachelor and a native of Aberdeen,- N. C,
where he was born April 9, 1857. in 1861
his parents moved to Sari Francisco,
where young Levingston Â¦ received his
early schooling. After passing through;
the ordinary schools he began Â¦ the study;
j of medicine In the Medical College of the
! Pacific, from which institution he grad
: uated about 1875. He then went to Eu-
I rope and attended the medical lectures
of the University cf Berlin, from 'which
he received a diploma in 1878. He re
turned to San Francisco in the following
year and began a practice which became
quite lucrative and which he pursued un
til 1807, when he was stricken down with
paralysis. His- right side was afflicted to
the extent that he was perfectly helpless. â¢
i The deceased was a Democrat and took
an active interest in the affairs of his
party. In 1881 he was elected Coroner by
a handsome majority* and he served in
that capacity during 1SS2-83. Aside from
this, however, he held no other public
offlce. Since he was stricken down he has
olten been near unto death, but never ex-

it) suing VV. F. Hopkins for a divorce, $100
a month alimony. Judge Blosa held that
the order made by Judge Graham, before
whom the divorce proceedings are pend
ing, giving Mrs. Hopkins $100 a month, la
In effect still and will remain so until the

the order taken by Hopkins. "Therefore,"
Bald Judge Sloss, "I cannot interfere with
an order made in another department of
this- court", i
She alleges further that the Baron has
treated her cruelly ever since their mar
rlagu in July, I8t)Â«. , She charges that in

their apartments on Mason street and
made numerous threats to kill her. Tho

by he was a Baron of the kingdom of
Holland, and because of the glory of his
past he. is in difficulties with his wife,
Rebecca Frances Schreckenberg. She
sued him for divorce yesterday, and one
of .the reasons why she does so, she nl
leges in her complaint, is because her no
b:e husband frequently demanded money
of her to "enable him to support himself
as. a gentleman befitting his education,
condition, rank and standing as a Baron
and nobleman of the kingdom of Hol
land."

New Scientific Treatment Kills Dan-
druff Germs and Makes Hair Soft.
It is an accepted fact, a proven fact,
that dandruff Is a germ disease, and it
Is also a demonstrated fact that New-
bro's Herpicide kills the dandruff germ.
Without dandruff falling hair will stop,
and thin hair will thicken. Herpicide not
only Â¦ kills the dandruff germ, but it also
makes hair as soft as silk. It Is the
most delightful hair dressing made. It
cleanses the scalp from dandruff and
keeps it clean and healthv. Itching and
irritation are instantly relieved, and per-
manently cured. At all druggists. There's
nothing "just as good." Take no substi-

AH the commercial bodies, will be invited to
help this- movement for the building up of thia
part of the State and all may give financial
aid to it in view of the acope and good prom
ised by united enfl determined effort. My gen
eral idea i* that the exhibit, resources and
plfvnt of the Stata Board of Trade should be
used as a nucleus, because that body has
much that would cost a large sum of money
to ' duplicate and there Is no reason . for dupli
cating it. as the board ia distinctly favorable
to the movement. The vote of the State Board
of Trade to give especial attention to promot
ing the interests of Northern California showe
the willingness of that body to co-operate, i it
may be necessary to have an additional exhibit
untown- while that at the ferry bulldinjr is
still retained. Of. course, that'is another mat
ter, of detail, to be settled by Â¦ the executive
committee' or other controlling body of ' the
propesed new organization. I will submit my
recommendations in writing. There is every
chance to have a financially strong body de
voted to the. interests of Northern California.
President George A. Newhall of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce has
practically decided on the recommenda
tions' that he will make next Monday at
the conference of the various commercial
bodies of San Francisco relative to tho
encouragement of . immigration â¢ to . the
California counties lying north of Tc
hachapl. President Newhall yesterday
afternoon told a reporter for The Call
the substance of the proposition that lie
will submit. He will favor the forma
tion of a new organization for the pur
poses in view, to have an executive com
mittee upon which the State Board of
Trade, the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce, the San Francisco Board of
Trade, the Merchants' Exchange, the Sac
ramento and San Joaquin Valley associa
tions, the Santa Clara- Valley Improve
ment Club, other interior bodies and in
terior counties shall be represented. Tho
details concerning the basis of representa
tion will be considered later. In explain
ing his plan Newhall said:
John M. Gamble has done himself 1us
tlce in his picture, "The Last Ray of Sun
light," which Is an admirable, dreamy
studyâ the sun bidding the woods a warm
au revolr.
There are many pictures "hung"
which are the result of genius and skill
and there are a few, as in all galleries
in the world, which may not reach the
very highest standard. 1 .
Very prominent among the really good
exhibits is found a study of animals by
Matilda Lotz, and it is well worth a visit
to the institute if only to get a sight of
these excellent canvases. One Is a study
of "oxen" and the other of "dogs." In
both pictures the artist shows a thorough
knowledge of animal' anatomy. She is,
furthermore, the mistress of color, know
ing how to apply the brush to a natural
certainty. There is an actual rivalry to
Landseer where the dogs. are concerned.
And as for the oxen, "Yoked and sleepy
eyed," ready for a journey, there has
been rarely anything better done in ani
mal painting. -
G. Cadenasso has but one canvas, "The
Pool," and it may take position with the
best of the landscapes in the salon. The
heavy, threatening sky throwing its dark
shadow over clusters of trees and darken
ing deeper "The Pool" in the foreground,
is. Admirably and strongly painted. ,
Henry Raschen is represented by five
studies of heads and one canvas showing
a traveler, who, having dismounted from
his horse, is hiding beside a tree-covered
rock, taking aim at two' stags loitering
in the forest. Raschen is a careful paint
er. His outdoor work is as true to detail
as that vWhich Is done by him in the
studio. - â¢ â¢ . â¢ Â¦ â¢ ' Â¦ ,. . Â¦--Â¦..

Deputy Recorder C. JO,.- Stoltz appeared
before tho committee . and urged' that an
appropriation be made to pay; four -extra
copyists it was found necessary to employ

could not be paid unless favorable action
was taken by the Supervisors. was
told to file Ails claim at the end of the
fiscal .year and if would be paid if there
io any. money left in the urgent necessity
fund. Stoltz said it would he just to al

office earned a surplus of $6000 yearly
Assessor Dodge appeared before the
Supervisors' Finance Committee last
night" to urge that he be allowed addi
tional deputies in his office for the col
lection of poll taxes. Chairman Brand
enstein informed Dodge that the initia
tory step for the appointment of any. ex
tra deputies in a city department must
originate in a recomnlendation from the
Mayor. Dodge informed the - committee
that he had conversed with the Mayor
and that the latter was favorable to the
proposition.
Dodge said he would require from $3000
to $5000 this year to pay eight deputies to
collect poll taxes alone. The collections
had largely increased and yet tho char
ter had cut down the appropriation for
clerical hire in the Assessor's office by
J25.000. -
"I am personally responsible on my
'Kind for tne collection of poll taxes," bald
Dodge, "and. I- would, like to collect the
full amount, as I , do not , desire to be
accused of laxity because the Supreme
Court has decided that the Assessor is nqt
entitled to commissions. My deputies
have worked overtime in the past and I
do not feel that I can compel them under
the charter to do so again."
The committee agreed to report favor
ably on allowing eight extra deputies for
April, May and June, contingent upon the
Mayor recommending the same. Provi
sion: will' be madÂ© in the.next.tax budget
for four deputies to be employed during
the remainder of the year. .

"WASHINGTON, March It.â All commu

and the Government regarding the friar
question In the Philippines have been
made independently of the apostolic dele

have reached here for Mgr. Sbaretti, : now
en route from Naples, and who, accord
ing to cable dispatches, has been directed
to proceed here, and await instructions
from Rome before going further into the
Philippine issue. '
The apostolic "delegation here, accord
ing to authoritative information, has
never been communicated with by Rome
on Cuban or Porto Riean matters, except
in* one instance. That was when the
Vatican wired the delegation that "it
had been determined to send a high ec
clesiastic who had the confidence of the
Americans to take charge of the affairs
of the church in Cuba and Porto Rico
and possibly later in the Philippines."
This announcement, which referred to
Mgr. Chapelle's appointment, did not
even mention his name. The object of this
silence is not known, though it is assumed
to be based on a desire to preclude any
allegation in the future that the delega
tion has ever sought to interfere -In any
manner with this Government and its pol

vital tcpics with them.
The lecturer also gave valuable in

The note that was held by the Central
Bank, covering the Oakland Enquirer,

to any bank in Oakland. What the con

refuse to say. Formerly the stock of the
paper was held by the Central Bank as
security for a loan of $55,000, and as fur
ther security the names of George C.
Pardee and Henry P. Dalton appeared
upon the note. The note . having been
paid off the stock now passes out of the
hands of the bank into the hands of those
who paid the note. Whether they now
hold it or whether it has been deposited
elsewhere no one will say.
Exactly what connection this loan has
with the suit now pending over the Oak

Governor into which the doctor has
launched is not certain.

living in an American territory and subject
to such laws as were not inconsistent with the
Joint resolution of Congress, nor contrary to

Until compulsory arbitration became
legalized, continued Signor Giolotti, lhtÂ»
Government should intervene on the ap
peal of both sides to a controversy to ef
fect a pacific settlement. The Government
should certainly intervene in the case of
a strike in the public services or the bak
ers, as such a strike led to anarchy.
On this ground the Minister ot the In
terior justified the attitude of toe Govern
ment' in the recent railway strike and ltd
endeavor to secure s&eisf action for- the"
legitimate aspirations of the railway emÂ»
ployes, many of whom were u.ipald. A
great result could be achieved, conc'uded
Signor f Giolottl, when the proletariat
ceased to regard the Government as 1U
enemy.
This was a justifiable aspiration, said
the speaicer, and since the demands weie
not political the movement couÂ»4 only be
come dangerous if the Government tried
to suppress it by force. The daty of the

tention being paid in the East to Oakland

knew to what extent capital is turning its
eyes toward their city as a field lor invest
ment.
What has been said about the plans of our
companies and the future of Oakland Is sub
stantially correct. The announcements that
have been made are guaranteed by the work
that has immediately followed looking to the
eeeuring of the franchises necessary.
The competing ferry is guaranteed by the
fact that the contracts for the machinery for
two ferry steamers have been let. The crowd

ing- of early orders for any iron work impera
tive, and the hulls for the boats will be ready

There is an accusation that to-day there
Is no standard at the Hopkins Art Insti
tute exhibitions and that sadly too many
amateurs are permitted to gain space
where once upon a time artists only â pro
fessional artists â those gentlemen born to
Bohemiaâ won by dint of labor, skill and
genius the right of being exhibited.
It is furthermore contended by these
gentlemen that there is a hush In the
voice that once inquired the price of can
vases and to get those days to come again
they must band together as artists, they
must exhibit as artists and then sell as
artists.
Piazzoni last evening decided, after con
sultation with his aids and supporters,
that in the course of a week he will con
sider the advisability of retiring from part
possession of Nob Hill and carry on oper
ations somewhere down in the city, where
an artists' camp shall be fitted and
equipped for the betterment of art and
the makers of art
The directors therefore are surrounded
on all sides. The army of jurors is led
fcy Arthur Mathews on the right and G.
F. P. Piazzoni on the left, the surround
ed force being- in personal command of
Director James W. Byrne.
The Call some days ago told of the dis
content of the jurors and their threat to
oppose the directorate so far as it went
in interfering' with selections and rejec
tions of pictures. And now on top of it
all comes the threatened revolt of the
artists.
The government whic-n directs the Art
Institute has heard soft mutterings ex
pand into significant and roaring grum
blings from the artist-jurors, and now
must meet on the other hand the wail and
assaults of those who heretofore have
gladly availed themselves of the privilege
and honor conferred by a beneficent and
kindly tolerant association.
Artists whose canvases adorn the walls
of the Hopkins Art Institute on Nob Hill
are having strenuous times. Aged wield
crs of the bru^h are shaking their heads
wondering what is going to happen next
and at the same time deploring the threat
ened rebellious charge upon an institute
which for many years has stood sponsor
for some of those who are now inclined
to t&ke up arms against it.

223^ â ; Smith, P.O. box 193, says:
"I was such a sufferer from dyspepsia that life was a burden. I could
hardly keep from eating all sorts of pastry, cakes and other -rich 1 , foods, . al-
though they did not agree with me. nor in fact did any sort of food. I became
low-spirited and discouraged, was tO3 weak to work and very seriously
troubled with palpitation of the heart. . v- ."
"Drugs eeemed to make me woree rather than better. A friend said one
day: 'I believe Grape-Nuts food would cure you,' explaining that that food
was made with great care and intended for the prevention and relief of dis-
eases that were brought about by improper food.
"That was Saturday night, and all day Sunday I kept thinking about
Grape-Nuts, and the first thing Monday morning I sent for a package. I had
It in my mind that the food would look like nuts, and was disappointed when
I found it had to be eaten with a spoon. However, I followed the directions,
and made a meal of Grape-Nuts and milk, which I found to be delicious, and
for the first time in months I suffered no distress after eating.
"I at once began to feel hopeful that I might be cured at last. Since that
day I have used Grape-Nuts constantly, morning and night, and have steadily
improved in health, until now I am as well as I ever was in my life; weigh
ten pounds more than I did a year ago, have no palpitation of the heart and
can work all day long. >
"At eupper I have Grape-Nuts mixed with soft-boiled eggs. I make my
dinner on any kind of food I desire. One of the best things about this cure"
by proper food is that I no longer have any desire for the rich, indigestible
rubbish of which I used to be bo fond."Steamer Movements

The wreck has proved a financial beneflt
to the Market-street Railway, the waffle
man, peanut vender and the saloon men
on the beach.
The life-saving crew paid a visit to the
wreck yesterday morning. Captain Var
ney had little trouble putting a line on
board and another line was fastened on
shore to hold the lifeboat between the
wreck and the beach. A few members Â»of
the schooner's crew went on board the
Reporter and secured . their personal ef
fects. They reported that the vessel was
leaking like a sieve and was breaking up.
It Is expected that the lumber on board
the schooner will float ashore. The vessel
and cargo will be sold at auction to-day
at the Merchants' Exchange.
Every person who went out to the beach
carled home. a piece of lumber as a souve
nir of the wreck. A number of Olympic
Club swimmers attempted to reach the
side of the schooner, but the heavy seas
forced them to return.
Thousands of people journeyed to tne
ocean beach yesterday to view the wreck
of the three-masted schooner Reporter.
Cameras were seen in number and the
stranded vessel was photographed on
every side. Residents in the vicinity
waited patiently for the vessel to go to
pieces so that they could recover the
lumber that floated ashore, but they were
disappointed, for the' stanch craft with
stood the heavy seas that flowed over her.
The vessel shifted a trifle and is now
closer inshore. Captain Varney of the
life-saving station says she will come still
closer inshore. . â¢

B. C, Sealing Company's fleet, have come
into this harbor during the last twenty
four hours in a disabled condition, and the
last one in reports two others making for

masters of all the vessels here say that
never before has the fleet experienced no
disastrous a season on this coast.
The Penelope, Captain Heater, arrived
this morning wltn all her fore rigging
gone and otherwise badly damaged, hav

effectual attempt in two weeks to leave
Mcnterey Bay and put to sea.
The Ocean Belle. Captain LfcFee, brings
the most thrilling tale of disaster. Be

fire. Her Chinese cook poured the schoon
er's entire supply of coal oil over every
accessible part of her and then set flre to
the deck house, not ten met ' from- where
a number of kegs of powder were stored.
As soon as the flames were discovered the
incendiary jumped overboard, and as all
hands were needed in fight fire no effort
was made to save him. It is believed he
was demented.
All .the schooners new here will remain

ARRIVED.
The Korea will have her trial trip next
Thursday and will leave for this port as
soon after that as possible. She is the
largest vessel that has ever entered this
harbor and promises I to revolutionize
trans-Pacific schedules. "_
The Korea and her sister ship, the Si
beria, each cost $2,000,000. The Siberia,
which will be similar in every respect to
the Korea, will not be here until late In
the summer.
Twenty knots an hour is the speed
promised for the giant liner. She i* 572
feet long, ha* a beam of 63 feet and dis
places 18,600 tons with 17 feet draught. She
will accommodate 1450 passengers and is
equipped with engines of 18,000 horse
power. Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ , . _, ,
She is longer than the steamship China
by 132 feet. The height of her sides is
forty feet and the distance around her
rail Is nearly a quarter of a mile. Cap
tain Seabury f who has been superintend
ing the construction of the leviathan, will

At the conclusion of Harris* remarks the
Senate at 4:30 p. m. went into executive
session and at 6:05 adjourned.
Harris of Kansas took constitutional
ground against the bill, maintaining that
it was a private measure to bestow upon
private individuals or corporations large
turns of money.
McLaurin of Mississippi followed For
aker. He was opposed, he said, not only
to the bill, but to the principles it repre
sents. Whatever is given by. the Govern
ment as a subsidy, McLaurin said, would
be simply a contribution to the dividends
of those engaged in shipping, instead of
for the purpose of encouraging ship
building in this country. He said there
had been no decadence in ship-building- in
America, all reports tending to show that
industry is now experiencing a boom
such as it has not had in fifty years. He
attacked the proposed United States Ship
building Company and called it a com
bination formed for the purpose of em
ploying labor as economically as possible.
Referring to his amendment, intro
duced recently, requiring the names of
persons, firms and members of corpora
tions that would be benefited by the bill
to bÂ© made public McLaurin said that the
taxpayers, from whom the subsidy must
come, should have an opportunity to know
the individuals to whom their money is
paid. Speaking of that portion of his
amendment prohibiting Senators and
members from enjoying any of the bene
fits of the bill by reason of their Interest
in shipping, he said that the necessity of
eliminating one's interest when it conflicts
with duty to the United States is ap
parent. He cited in support of his posi
tion the charges brought against Embas
sador Clayton and said that a Government
official must not have his duty on one side
and his private interests on the other.
In proof of the greater cost of ships
constructed in America. Fora Her- read a
letter from President Baker of the Atlan
tic Transportation Line, showing that the
contract price for two ships built for the
company at Belfast. Ireland, was Â£292,000,
while the cost of two ships identically the
came in construction, built at Camden, N.
J., was Â£380,000. Foraker asserted that
the International Navigation Company â
the American Line â had made no money
by carrying the mails under the postal
subsidy act and did not care for a re
newal of its contract.
Foraker of Ohio said that while he ex
pected to vote for the bill, he was not en
tirely satisfied with it. Ever since he had
studied the question he had been of the
opinion that the most equitable and suit
able way to rehabilitate the merchant
marine of the United States would be to
inaugurate the policy of discriminating
duties under which the fathers of the
country made our merchant marine the
pride- of the country.
He -was of the opinion that under the
circumstances it would be impossible to
attempt to return to the policy of dis
criminating' duties. He had followed the
trend of legislation closely enough to
learn that it was highly necessary to have
a majority in favor of any proposition be
fore it was enacted into law. He had con
sulted with his colleagues in the Senate
and recognized the impossibility of secur
ing the majority in favor of the policy of
discriminating duties. Being .desirous of
building' up the merchant marine, he took
therefore the next best scheme for accom
plishing this result.
As to the relative cost of building and
operating American ships under the
American flag, Foraker said the prepon
derance of evidence was against the
proposition that vessels could be built or
operated in this country as cheaply as
they could be built and operated abroad.
"WASHINGTON",. March 14.â Throughout
the session of the Senate to-day the ship
subsidy bill was under consideration.

~ABOUT~C ATA RR fTieijRESr
The Reason Why Infcalers and Local
Applications Are Useless.
For many years catarrh was considered to
be a local disease and was treated entirely 'by '
local remedies, salves, ointments, powders,
sprays and Inhalers, and nearly all of these Â¦
pave a temporary relief, but a genuine perma-
nent care was very rare.
Â¦
It Is true the most annoying symptoms, like
stoppage of the nose and throat trouble are
rurely local, but they are simply symptoms and
the real seat of disease Is far removed.
Catarrh is a constitutional disease, a blood
disorder, complicated usually with disease of
the liver, and to suppose that local applications
cf sprays, powders, inhalers, could ever reach
ihe real cause of the trouble Is ridiculous.
The sensible and successful treatment' Is to
remove the catarrhal poison from the system
by regulating the liver and purifying the blood
tnd this can only be done by an internal rem-
edy, which should consist of antiseptics and
remedies to act vigorously on the blood and
The best preparation of this kind which fills
all the requirements of a sale constitutional
treatment is Stuart's Catarrh Tablets com-
posed of Blood Hoot, Red Gum and slmHar
wholesome antiseptics, which are absolutely
cafe to take into the stomach and which act
upon the liver, stomach and mucous mem-
brane.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are large, pleasant

Dr. Edmondson, in speaking of the new
treatment for catarrh, says: "I have accom-
plished the most satisfactory results in all
forms of catarrh of the head, throat, bronchial
tubes, as well as catarrh of the stomach and
liver, by using nothing else but Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets. I long since threw aside sprays
and inhalers as being inconvenient and at the
best mere temporary make-shifts.
"Stuart's Catarrh Tablets act immediately
Â¦upon the liver and blood and clear the wholo
eystem of catarrhal poison. They are pleasant
and very convenient to use. and they are not
only the latest, but I believe them to be the
best and certainly the safest treatment for any
form of catarrh."
All druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
at 50 cts. for full Eized package.

NEW YORK, March 14.â Offerings of tiu
NEW YORK, March 14,â Bradstreet's to
morrow will say:
The week ends more favorably than It be
gan. This is particularly 'true of weather con
ditions and of affairs Industrial, which have
Improved greatly in various sections of the
country. Plenty of rains in the entire winter
wheat belt, and more especially in the drouth
afflicted Southwest, have given a needed im
petus to that crop, which has been likewise
favored by the succeeding mild weather. The
apparent advent of the spring season and it*
promise of earllness has been an important
stimulant to most linen of trade and Â¦ industry,
which were thus enabled to throw off the fet
ters placed upon them by storms and the en
tailed interruptions to transportation.
There is less excitement but more strength
in iron and Bteel.
Wheat was buoyed up by the report of the
emnlleet reserves In i armern' hands - by ' the
Government, Bradstreet's calculations, based
on the above, pointing to a very small in
crease in the visible supplies In view of the
record-breaking crops in this country and the
world at large. This steadied prices for 'a
time, but they weakened later on the report
of the breaking of the drouth in the South
west and of supplies of moisture to winter
wheat in other sections.
The roost active export demand for some
weeks 1 pact developed at the decline and ex
cited some influence for later firmness.
Wheat, including: flour, exports for the week
aggregate 2.CO0.2C0 bushels, against 4,006,044
last week and 4,090,939 In this week last year.'
Wheat exports July 1, 1901, to date, 37
weeks, aggregate 187,168,621 bushels, against
142,172.145 last season. "'< i *^**b"aol^e

CHICAGO, March 14. â Corn strength domi
nated grains for the greater part cf the session
to-day. Local bulls took corn in hand shortly
after the opening and easily forced prices up
the better part of a cent. Many bears went
home last night with short lines,' expecting a
further'decline to-day on yesterday's weakness.
Cables, however, were remarkably steady, there
was fear of a general spread of the cold wave
in the Northwest and a leading bull started in
early to bail out the offerings in the pit. Feed
ing demand west was good and the West had
nothing to sell. Kansas City was reported bid
ding lc over Chicago in Iowa yesterday. Re
ceipts here were very light and the cash'situa
tion was much improved. The break in wheat
had. nothing but a temporary easing effect.
May closed firm, %@%c higher, at ti2Vi@<>2%c.
Wheat at one time during the session . felt
enough of the corn strength and the below aero
weather in the Northwest to acquire a firm
tone and sell above yesterday's closing price.
After the slump of yesterday the cables had a
very steady tone. Commission houses were ex
ecuting fair . buying orders early, shorts be
came uneasy and covered. The market was
fairly active and showed a fair amount of
strength up to noon. The coarse grains aided
materially in the situation, but later, when sta
tistical journals announced the Western condi
tion favorable In the -extreme, heavy selling set
in. St. Louie and the crowd were very bearish,
and prices suffered a Eerlous relapse. May',
which opened a shade to %@Y*c up at 75%c to
75%c and sold up to 75%c, dropped quickly to
a- weak close, %@%c lower, at 74 %c.
Oats were dull and ruled fairly steady. May
closed %c lower at 45%c.
Provisions were early weak In sympathy -with
a lower hog market. The late trade was dull.
May pork closed 5c higher, - lard a shade lower
and ribs unchanged.

WHEAT â The foreign markets were weak,
with lower futures atNParis. The Argentine
shipments fcr the week were 644,000 bushels,
against 1,248,000 for the same week last year.
Tho American exports this week were 2,900,000
bushels, including flour.
Chicago opened firmer on the light Argen
tine shipments and below zero weather fa the
British Northwest, and all markets werefa'crk
ing around stronger on a predicted coldJwave.
Yhcre "vere renewed complaints of danuigÂ£ in
Kansas, where the rains have been only par
tial and insufficient and where there is in
addition talk of the Hessian fly. The crop
report of the Modern Miller was also another
bearish factor. Kansas has had no rain in
those sections where CO â¢ per cent of the crop
is raised.

Eggs showed no further change of conse
quence yesterday. All dealers reported plenty
of stock on ' hand, and some had mora than
they could handle., but the market was steady.
Dealers are still doing- some storing at the
present prices, but the recent advance makes
cold storage now considerable of a gamble. It
costs Sc per dozen to place Eggs in cold stor
age, figuring lc for the case, 2o for storage
charge, lc for breakage and lc for interest and
contingent expenses, so that Eggs that go Into
cold storage at 16c stand tha owner 21c when
he takes them out in the fall. An advance of
another cent would probably shut off the stor
age demand altogether. The- local consumptive
demand is', good, and occasionally a dealer
squeezes 17c for the finest ranch, if he delivers
them, ' but the great bulk of Â¦ the goods do not
tell over 16c. The majority of the trails would
prefer to see the goods above the storage price,
as the storage purchases are taking a good
many Eggs away from the regular channels,
but 16c "appears all that the' public will stand
at the moment. . .
â¢ Butter is weak, but the Impending decline
has not yet occurred. Stocks are ample for all
current requirements and buyers continue to
purchase from hand to mouth.

Official indications of farm reserves on
March 1 were not surprising as to corn, deal
ers anticipating that supplies would be only
about one-half last year's, but the statement
that 23 per cent of the enormous wheat yield
remained in farmers' hands was not calculated
to sustain values. Needed rains in, the South
west made the market look more favorable for
tl'e next crop. A sustaining feature was the
interior movement of only 2.681,891 bushels,
against 3,902.650 last year, while on the other
hand total exports from the United State3 were
but 2.59S.472 bushels, compared with 4,962,674
a Failures for the" weak were 232 in. the United
States, against 209 last year, and 34 in Canada,

Consumers of Iron and- steel products are
still anxious regarding conditions during the
next three months.
Business in Boston was completely paralyzed
by the strike of freight handlers and teamsters,
which directly affected 40,000 men and indirect
ly rendered other thousands Idle by holding
back supplies of raw Â¦ material. â¢ Fortunately
this struggle was brief, but another will begin
on Monday at Fall River mills and other tex
tile plants in that vicinity." Outside of Massa
chusetts, however, the labor situation is ex
ceptionally free from controversy and even in
the coal mines there is less than the usual agi
tation, a3 April approaches. Distribution of
spring merchandise Is makin's rapid progress,
the most sanguine expectations being fully
realized In all sections outside the strike area.

Harrison's circular says: "During tho weelc
there have been six coal arrivals from Wash
ington with 18,290 tons; â¢ four from British,
Columbia, 13,467 tons; two from Oregon. 1450
tons; total, 34,207 tons. . With the quantity at
hand this week there Is no scarcity of steam.
grades, but for household uses there is very
little arriving, hence full values axe main
tained; fortunately the ear marks of spring are
visible and the domestic consumption will
diminish. It is anything but interesting read
ing for- coal producers to scan the list of names
(140 in number) of thoso who are now utilizing
oil, who formerly consumed coal to produce the
necessary motive power for their factories.
This is for San Francisco alone; there certain
ly must be at least forty more industrials
around the bay that have likewise modified
their methods. This is a sorry outlook for our
coast collieries which produce only steam
coal3. Still the interests of the many must be
subserved, although it may be detrimental to
the few, as cheap fuel ia causing a large num
ber of factories to be established which were
never dreamed of formerly. Coal freight* from
Australia show no improvement, although the
pronounced shrinkage In outward grain char
ters should strengthen colonial rates. The
Wellington colliery is getting Into* shape to
send forward its regular output, and this will
relieve tha demand for domestic grades."

The first grand ball of the Union LaNnr

29th inst. Two gold watches will be
awarded to the most popular union gen

What effect this sale will have upon
other independent canners who had given
Hunt Brothers contracts for cans is not
known. Work on the new plant has been
stopped and all of the workmen dis
charged. The Hunts admit the sale of
their plant to tho trust.
The Hunts went into the market this
year and managed to purchase a lot of
tin. They then began the construction of
a large can plant at the foot of Oak
street, doubling their capacity and taking
a lot- of' contracts from the canning com
panies that are not in the combine.
The success of the Hunt Brothers in
getting their new can plant in working
order brought the trust to time, and it
has now purchased the factory that men
aced them. The sale price is said to be
$30,000, with a guarantee upon the part of
thjs trust that the Hunts win be able to
purchase cans for five years at a rate of
?2 a thousand less than the market price,
they agreeing to keep out of the can man
ufacturing business for. ten years.
Hunt Brothers, when they started to
fight the California Fruit Canners' Asso
ciation, found themselves also fighting the
American TJan Company, which was in
harmony with the Fruit Canners' Asso
ciation. They also found themselves un
able to get cans on as. favorable terms as
the opposition combination, and they
were decidedly handicapped. They then
established a small can plant in Oakland
and managed to get a little tin and manu
facture a few cans for their own use.
The only opposition of any importance
that has developed to the American Can
Company, otherwise the "tin can trust,"
has been absorbed. The factory that was
in course of construction in Oakland oy
Hunt Brothers has been purchased by tha
American Can Company, and the trust is
now in supreme control of the situation
as far as tin cans are concerned.

LONDON. March 13. â Cabling from
Odessa Sunday, March 9, the correspond
ent of the Standard says that the arrest
yesterday of a group of students bearing
red flags led to an attempted rescue ami
a. riot occurred, during which, it is ru
mored, a policeman and a rioter were
killed. One hundred and si::ty arrests
have been made and troops now patrol
the city to prevent a recurrence of the
disorder. . ; .
The cases of William Buckley, convicted
of murder in the first degree, and Charles
Donnelly, convicted of murder In the sec
ond degree, werp 'called before Judge
Lawlor yesterday morning on the motions
for a new trial and judgment was re
served till next Friday. The case of Mo
ran, another defendant, will be called this
mornins. ': ,v ;.
Detective Timothy J. Bailey then testi
fied to conversations he had with Duncan
after his arrest which were corroborative
of the statement made by the defendant
to Levings. The trial will be resumed
Monday.
Walter J. Fiatt was as positive as his
daughter Erline, who testified Thursday,
that Buckley was the man who fired the
shots into Rice's prostrate form. â¢
The importance of Wuth's testimony
was shown when W. H. Levings, a clerK
at police headquarters, was called and
testified as to a statement made to him
by Duncan the morning after the mur
der. In that statement Duncan said that
he had served drinks to Buckley, Moran
and Donnelly about 4 o'clock on the after,
noon of the murder: that Â«he left them
about 5 o'clock and took a car to go to
Twentieth and Howard streets to call
upon a friend; that he heard the shooting
and saw the 1 men running away, but did
not know them. .' ?:â¢Â¦;.
Wuth testified that about 6:20 o'clock
on the evning of October 11 he was look
ing 1 out of a window in his home at the.
corner of Lafayette and Howard streets
when he saw Duncan walking backward
and forward. He went outside the house
and Duncan' beckoned to him to cross the
street. Duncan told him, after they had
talked for a few minutes about the strike,
that_he was waiting for Rice. Two ot
three cars passed while they were talking.
Duncan finally hailed and boarded a car,
the presumption being that some one on
it had signaled to liim. The "witness said
another striking machinist named Stew
art could corroborate this statement
Wuth said he had gone to Hollister after
the shooting as he did not wish to ap
pear as a witness in the. case.
There was a surprise in store yesterday

No Bight to Remit Amount
to Corporation. â¢Â¦'Â¦â¢ - Â¦ V' .X
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Supervisors yesterday that there is no
statute which ; provides that when the
Tax Collector has made a mistake in fail
ing to supply the taxpayer with "proper
bills the taxpayer shall be relieved of his
personal responsibility of.seeing that his
taxes are paid. The sending of the bills
by the Tax Collector is an act" of courtesy
and not a legal duty and If the taxpayer
relies upon the bills sent by the Tax Col
lector rather than on. his own knowledge
of what property he owns, the State is not
so considerate as to grant him an exemp
tion from penalties or taxes.
The opinion is in answer to a petition
filed by the Virginia and Gold Hill Water
Company to remit the penalty for failure
to pay taxes on its franchise assessment
for the fiscal year 1901 upon the ground
that the Tax Collector failed to send
among other bills, the bill for the tax on
the franchise of the company.

The first consignment Of Chinese labor
ers, for the Alaskan fisheries will leave
for the north this morning. About E00
Mongolians were rounded up yesterday
by the agents of the various commercial
companies and placed on board tho
steamer that will take them to their des
tination. During the next few days these
laborers will continue to depart until
abcut 3000 of them will have changed
their place of residence until the autumn
season. \
The departure of the horde of fishermen
leaves work for. the detectives and em
ployers to locate over 200 embezzlers,
â¢whose total defalcations amount to 120,000.
At present the agents have endeavored to
find the -whereabouts of these men, but
after the last vessels have been cut loose
from their docks the police will be asked
to search for those who are among the
missing that they may answer tÂ«> crim
inal charges.
â¢It has been the habit for a number of
years past to advance money to the labor
ers that they may settle their debts be
fore the new year, as well as celebrate
that event 'in splendor. Each Chinese
signs a contract that he will sail before
a certain time and work until the end of
the season. This year the amounts ad
vanced were unusually large and In some
instances reached . $200. On an average,
however, $100 was awarded to each per
son who applied. When the system of
advancing wages was inaugurated -little
difficulty was experienced. The men put
in an appearance at the specified time
and adhered to their contracts, but within
the past three years many have pocketed
the money and disappeared.
When the agents came to round up tna
men auring tne P a*t week they Reived
information, which they verified that
ever 200 who signed contracts had de
parted for parts unknown and had no in
tention of going to Alaska. Nocrtaitaal
action can be taken against these men
until after the last consignment sails, but
St that time warrants w?ll be 'f^f'^
t^eir arrest. The demand for Chinese
labor throughout the country is said to
have been the cause for the many
breaches of contract. . .

The attorneys engaged in thÂ» work of
settling the estate of the late Thomas Bell
are exchanging courtesies. Unfortunate
ly for the peace and dignity of the occa
sion, the compliments that are being ex
changed are touched with gall, the result
being bitter expressions, which may yet
be brought to the attention of the court
for inquiry as to the rights of the parties
Interested.
Attorney T. Z. Blakeman, counsel for
Mrs. Teresa Bell, administratrix of the
estate of her late millionaire husband, ob
jects to certain statements made by At
torney John S. Drum, one of the attor
neys for the creditors of the estate, and
particularly to his allegation that "the
substitution of Blakeman for Staacke has
been of no advantage or benefit to the
creditors."
I It happens that Staacke was removed
D. A. Socci, an art dealer of Manila, ia
having a lively time with the Collector of
the Tort and the United States Apprais
ers over a duty of $SO00 assessed against
a big- war picture he brought over from
Manila on the last trip of the America
Maru. The^picture, which is an immense
canvas, is held by the authorities until
the duty is paid or the Government
waives the right to collect it bn the
ground that the Philippine Islands are
American possessions.
Soon after the close of the war with
Spain Socci conceived the idea of having
the scenes attending the capture of Ma
nila portrayed on canvas. He engaged a
young Spanish artist named Santos Gon
zales to paint It. Gonzales had all the ex
perience necessary for the work and de
voted fifteen months of his time to it.
The picture, which is thirty-four feet
long by fourteen feet. wide, depicts the
entrance of the American troops into Ma
nila. Many of the portraits of the com
manders are sketches from life. One fea
ture that will make it doubly interesting
to people here Is the picture of the First
California Regiment, under the leadership
of Colonel James F. Smith. Colonel
Smith is mounted and his action is most
life-like.
"I have brought this picture to San
Francisco for exhibition," said Mr. Socci
at his apartments at the Palace Hotel
yesterday. "The picture is not for sale.
I could not even put a value on It, so I do
not see how the appraisers can charge me
a duty of 58000 on it. I thought that when
we bought the Philippine Islands they be
came American territory, and as the con
stitution prohibits the levying of duties
between one part of the United States and
the other I' think this exaction Is unjust.
I am gqing to follow the' matter -right
through to the highest court in the land
before I will submit to â¢ what I consider
this most unjust imposition."
All day yesterday the wires were -kept
hot, SoccÂ»'s lawyers , filing protest after
protest against the exaction of the $8000
duty. Unless the valuation is taken;' off
by the Collector of the Port an appeal will
be at once forwarded to the Board of
General Appraisers in New, York. Socci
may in the meantime secure the release
of the picture by filing a bond to cover
the duty. \ - -.. Â¦ /Â«

The attention of the wardens is called to
the fact that the infliction of punishment
unnecessarily cruel is a crime subject both
to civil and criminal action.
The commission intends that there will
be no -further use of the straltjacket
even if legal steps have to be .taken, in
order to prevent it. A watch is being
maintained in both prisons and at the
first instance of the use of the stralt
jÂ«ek>t a warrant will be sworn out for
the arrest Of the warden and He will be
rigorously prosecuted. II is claimed by the
commission that In several cases where
the "Jacket has been used .the prisoner has
been maimed for life. All past cases of
cruelty, however, will be ignored if the
prison officials will be more lenient in
their treatment of convicts in the future.

BLAKEMAN SAYS
DRUM IS WRONG
Stork Pays a Visit to the Home of the
New California Jockey Club's
â¢President.
. The friends of Thomas H. Williams Jr.,
president of the New California Jockey
Club, showered- felicitations upon him
yesterday upon the advent of a son and
heir. . v
The auspicious event happened earlv In
the afternoon. The flags at Emeryville
seemed to flutter joyously when it bs
came noised about and the good wishes
of a host of people went out to the
mother and to hor first born.
The happy father was in a transport of
joy. Throughout the day and far Into
the night he was receiving and answer
ing congratulatory telegrams from all
over the country.
trom the executorship of the estate for
cause and to compare him with Staacke
therefore is regarded by Blakeman as be- I
ing both defamatory and injurious. He
therefore returns the lire in an affidavit
to be filed in which he says that Drum is
not only mistaken, but that he deliberate
ly utters what he knows to be a malicious !
falsehood when he says that he (Blake
man) has managed the Bell estate to the j
detriment of the creditors or any one else
interested tnerein. i
The trouble started some time ago Â¦when
a petition was tiled in the Probate Court
for a discontinuance of Mrs. Bell's family
allowance. The petition was backed by
the creditors represented by Drown,
Leicester & Drown, who alleged that the
estate was being mismanaged and that
Attorney Blakeman was getting more out
of the estate in the way of fees than
should be allowed. The matter was set
for hearing by Judge Coffey on Tuesday
next and a lively session of court is
promised.
Declares Attack Unwarranted.
Attorney Blakeman declared yesterday
that the attack upon him was unwar
ranted. He has prepared an answer to the
attack upon him. which he will bring to
the attention of the court, and therein he
says that ho was instrumental in settling
the Robinson litigation for $40,971, all of
which went to the Bell estate. Drum, he
says, was one of the attorneys for tho
Robinson estate and opposed him bitterly
and he attributes Drum's animus to that
fact. To the complaint of the creditors
that Blakeman's office rent was being paid
out of the funds of the Bell estate, the
attorney replies that the statement is un
true and that Drum is well aware of the
fact.
Blakeman' charges that the greater
number of the creditors who are contest
ing the accounts of Mrs. Bell did so only
at the urgent Solicitation of Drown. To
a Call reporter yesterday he said:
It has been repeatedly admitted by many of
the creditors that the affairs of the estate are
being well managed by Mrs. Bell. The state
ment of the attorneys who represent them
that she has drawn too much money In the
shape of family allowance is untrue and un
fair. In the early years of the administration
of the estate she did not draw all that the
court had allowed her, and instead of drawing
$107,000, as stated, she In fact drew only
$70,000 since the death of her husband in Oc
tober. 1892.
Drown is one of . the attorneys for Mips
Thompson, who secured the Lag-una Rancho
from Bxecutor Staacke at half Its value, and
principally because of this transaction he wa3
removed as executor. The Bell estate la now
BUingr Miss Thompson for the recovery of this
fine property on the main ground that Staacke' i
connection with the foreclosure proceedings
Â¦was fraudulent.
Expect to Recover Thousands.
We expect to win this suit and recover more
than $50,000 for the estate. I charge that
Drown has contracted with the creditors he
represents to collect their claims on a per
centage ba?is, and yet In the face of this he
represents a client with whom the estate la
now In litigation. My fees never were exces
sive and I will demand a hearing: by Judge
Coffey when the matter comes up next Tues
day.
Blakeman says further that he may dis
close some of the inside facts relative to
the attempt of Staacke to 'compromise the
valuable .Robinson claim, in . which Drum
was interested as attorney, for $2500. At
that time Staacke swore that there was
nothing in the Robinson estate excent a
parcel of land, which was mortgaged for
more than it was worth. Blakeman op
posed the compromise and after eighteen
months of litigation, succeeded in collect
ing from the Robinson estate for the Bell
estate the sum of $40,971. . .
Altogether a. warm time Is looked for
when the attorneys gfet into court. Blake
man states that he will defnd himself
vigorously and that if somebody is in
jured in the operation he will not' hold
himself responsible. Meanwhile his rela
tions with Attorney Drum are strained to
the bursting point. Drum smiles and says
nothing. < Â»

SON AND HEIR IS B0BN
TO THOMAS H. WILLIAMS JR.
Jewelry and diamonds valued at $1000
were stolen from the apartments of Julius
Kruttschnitt, manager of the Southern
Pacific,' at the Hotel Richelieu, on Van
Xess avenue, some time between the hours
of S and 7 o'clock Thursday evening. The
theft was accomplished while Mr. and
Mrs. Kruttschnitt were at dinner. The
jewels were locked in the top drawer of
a dressing case in the bedroom, and this
was opened with a key by the thief, the
valuables extracted and the drawer re
locked. ,
Upon returning from dinner to the
apartments Mrs. Kruttschnitt opened the
drawer for some purpose and at once dis
covered the loss. There were missing two
gold watches, several diamond rings, a
diamond brooch and some other trinkets
of less value.
The robbery was 'reported at onca to
th : office of the hotel and ah effort was
made to keep the occurrence secret, but
it became known to several of the guests
and yesterday was a generally discussed
topic among them.
The police were notified by Mr. Krutt
schnitt and a description of the missing
valuables was given. A detective was de
tailed on the case, who spent yesterday
investigating the robbery. All of the em
ployes of the hotel who could In any
manner gain access to the apartments
were subjected to questioning. It was
evident from the nature of the theft that
it was either the work of an experienced
hotel thief or some one connected with
the hotel in a capacity that would give
an opportunity to know the movements
of the guests.
The police refuse to admit anything
,concerning the robbery, or even thit it
took place. '. Â¦
