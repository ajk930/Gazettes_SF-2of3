N. W., WASHINGTON. March 19.
Because of the tremendous inter-,
national consequences of its suc
cess, this and European govern
ments are following with -the deepest in
terest the. progress of the'., revolution in
Southern China. There is a disposition In
diplomatic circles to charge the United
States, Great Britain and Germany with
portlal responsibility for ! the victories
thus far won by jthe rebels. . Despite . the
efforts of certain powers. these. three gov
ernments, failed to take any action'look
ing to the carrying out. of the first article
of the peace protocol signed last Septem
ber at Peking, which prescribes that
China has agreed to prohibit the importa
tion Into Its territory of arms and ammu
nition, as well as of materials exclusively
used for the manufacture of arms and
ammunition. " Â¦;".;.'â¢'. â¢'Â¦Â¦'*.' ' : .
Dr. Silva left Washington yesterday for
New York City, whence he will sail short
ly for Colombia.
The revision of the protocol proposed by
Dr. Silva. the retiring Colombian Minis
ter, embodying the terms : under which
Colombia is willing to cede to the United
States the rights incident to the building
of a Panama canal, has been completed
by Dr. Concha, the new Minister at Wash
ington- It is stated that the protocol will
be submitted to Admiral "Walker, chair
man of the Canal Commission, before the
end of the current week, to be by him
turned over to Secretary Hay. It is etated
that the protocol, as it now stands, does
not differ very materially from what it
â¢was when about to be presented by Dr.
Silva.
Under the title thus acquired the new com- '
pany took up the. work and continued it until
Â«. large part of Us capital had been expended.
It would become necessary to ralsa funds .for '
the completion of the canal from the public
By this time, however, a new danger menaced
It in the announced intention of the United
States to build an isthmian canal. Investors
could be Induced to furnish money only by the
prospect of a profitable return. But if the
canal mutt compete with one built and main
tained by a Government which could and would
dtereg&rd all questions of profit the chance ot
a profitable return was gone. It would not
pay to complete the canal, and therefore money
could not be raised to complete It. As an en
(rlr.eerlng proposition the canal was perfectly
feasible and was attractive; as a commercial
proposition the certainty of the. competition or
the United State's made it impossible, except
under the- auspices of Governments which
might, for public reasons, acquire the canal
For the second time it became necessary to
consider the means of saving something from
this property, .r which must be wholly lost If
the canal were not completed. Since the com
pany could not raise the money to complete
the canal the only practicable course wai to
cell the property. ' i . -\. Â¦Â¦
The title of the new Panama Company to
Us concessions and ether property appears
from the facts and documents which have been
laid before the sub-committee and Is clear and
Jree from any complications. For a transfer ]
of its concessions . to the United States â¢ the |
consent of Colombia is required, but this con
cent has been given by the Government of
that country ac fully as it can now be given.
In case of purchase of the canal by the United
States different concessions and different rights ]
must be obtained by treaty between this coun- |
try and Colombia, and such a treaty would j
necessarily Involve a consent to the sale by !
the company of its rights and property on the
isthmus to the United States. Such a treaty
Colombia has shown end declared Its readl- I
ness to make. In every other point . the right
of the new Panama Canal Company to transfer ;
it* property to the United States is perfectly >
clear. Every link in the chain of its title" I
and every step In the course by which it be- i
came In a position to sell Us property free !
and clear, Is plain and satisfactory. . . j
The report then reviews the entire origin !
and history of the Panama Canal Com- 1
pany, and finds that the affairs of the old 1
company were disposed of by a French
court in a straightforward way when that !
company became insolvent and that the j
court had a perfect right, not only to ap- i
point a liquidator or receiver, but to con- '
ler upon him, as was done, power "to !
grant or contribute to any new company !
all or part of the corporate assets." !
The various objections to the new com-1
pany's title are then .considered and re-j
plied to. The following explanation is!
made of the reasons why the new com
pany should desire to sell:
The minority report, which was pre
pared by Senator Kittredge, completely
upholds the title- of the new Panama
Canal Company, as will be seen from the
following extract which constitutes its
opening paragraph:
Government was in the travail of Its birth.
Unfortunately the report of the Isthmian
Canal Commission reveals the fact that the
men who made this offer are chief among
those who defrauded these six or eight hundred
thousand Frenchmen of $250,000,000.
Speaking further of the obligations of
the new company to the old the majority
eays:
.If Mr. Eiffel and his associates get $40,000.
000 from the American people it is weii that
they are sheltered from the claims of these
defrauded and despoiled bondholders and stock
holders by the alleged despotism of French
courts. They would never escape Justice in
American courts and would be compelled to ac
cousn for every dollar of the money to the
bondholders and to the stocks bearing inter
eft before applying any of it to the profits
of their speculation.
The objections of the majority to the
title held by that company are based
largely, on the relations of the canal com
pany to the Governments of France and
Colombia, but the committee also dis
cusses at length many other phases of
the question. Among these is the relation
of the shareholders who subscribed $260,
000,000 to the old Panama Company, whose
Interests, the report holds, cannot " be
lightly regarded. On this point the report
says:
The spectacle of the United States Congress
authorizing the President, as ths agent ot
our Government, to conduct a trade with such
a corporation (the new Panama Canal Corn
pany) without consulting France as to the
claim of independence it (the new Panama
Company) asserts will be entirely new in the
history of nations, and its consequences can
not be lightly disregarded.
Among those is the serious danger of the
United States being drawn into disagreeable
relations with a large and influential body ot
the worthy people of France, whose friendship
for us has been cherished during the entire
life of our republic and had its origin in mag
nanimous sacrifices tor our country when this

D.^Silliman yesterday* during the argu
ment, delivered a severe arraignment of
tne policy of the United States toward the
Territory; of Hawaii, continuing his criti
cisms Until he was stopped by Judge Es
tee. ;:.> : , 'Â¦
The case was tried before and. tt verdict
Of Jipo.OOO for the defendant's lands was
given by "the jury. Judge Estee set It
aside as -excessive, at the same time oi
fering to approve a Verdict for J75.U00, if
the defendants woukl accept that sum.
This was refused and a new. tria.1 was or
dered. ,
Judge Sllliman replied in bitter, terms to
a statement of United States Attorney J.
J Lmnne to ihe eitect tnat tne .United
atates was establisning- the naval station

ing or money ne sasd: - â¢
/ -The United - States is taking a million j
and a half a year away irom Hawaii in;
customs dutied and ougnt to spend it \
nere. The naval station is -not Â¦ for . the |
benefit of Hawaii, but lor the defense or_j
the i*aclhc Coast. It will be a Â»name and
an outrage it the national Government
gets this land -for one dollar less than tt
la worth. 'The national supreme Court
has said that the surest test of the hon
esty of the Government is the manner in
which it takes the property of citizens un
der its right of eminent domain, and u
will be an ineradicable blot upon the na
tional honor if it can be said that the
United States forced any citizen of this
Territory out of his property, and did not
give him fair value for it." â¢ â¢ -V-'-Â«
Judge Silliman stated that he was born
an American and was a lover of his coun
try and its institutions, but that he did
not thfnk the United States was treating
Hawaii rightly. He bitterly criticized thu
proceedings in the Pearl Harbor cases ii3
having be-en conducted in a spirit of un
fairness to the owners of the land. He
proceeded with a long ' discussion of . al
leged causes of complaint and wa^ im
pressively stating to the jury that tho
honor of the United States was on trial in
the proceedings in its behalf to condemn
land, when Judge Estee called him to or
der. â¢ ' '
"Don't talk about the United States."
said the Judge. "Talk about your case."
United States Attorney ?Dunne also
made an angry protest against Silliman's
line of argument and the latter resumed
discussion of the evidence. Late last
night the jury returned a verdict for $102,
523. . United States Attorney Dunne took
an exception to the verdict and will move
for a new trial on the ground that it is
excessive. ". -
The Kona Sugar Company has aa far
found no way-out of its difficulties and
Judge Humphreys has made an order di
recting the receiver to advertise on March
15 a sale of all its properties for the satis
faction of creditors. The action -for the
appointment ot a- receiver was withdrawn
and a petition was presented -asking for
the discharge of the receiver. This was
approved, subject to the payment of the
expenses incurred by the receiver In car
rying on. the plantation and a fee of $1000
for - himself and attorneys. So far ths
sum required, amounting to about $6500.

worth $200,000 in danger of being lost.

if the idea of: the Filipino people regard
ing/the hopes and aspirations for inde

"No.,", said General Otis, "Agulnaldo
had his ambitions. And he was sent over
from Hongkong for the. purpose of driv
ing the Spaniards out and then attack
ing the Americans, I suppose. We have
the papers of the original junta."
In response to Senator Carmack he said
that he had no plan of action in contem

not occurred that night and that the
treaty had been ratified the next day.

very quickly.
"No man ever worked harder in , the

eral, "but if the United States troops had
attacked the Filipinos and driven them
out of the city when they first got there
it would have been much better."
â¢ The trouble in Luzon, General. Otis said,
was caused by the good men being over
thrown' because of fear of assassination.

General Otis declared he did not say
Aguinaldo was a robber and a looter. He
characterized ' him' as much better than
the majority of the Filipinos. In money
matters he. believed Aguinaldo' strictly

This is a very little world. I may see you
again soon. It is hard' to tell Just what I
will do. Good-by. Respectfully,
JENNIE HAMILTON.
Dear Friend " Mr.. Smith: I just returned
from a trip to Oakland. The country looku
fine; wish I, were going to live there the rest
of my days. I suppose you remember of my
saying to ; you - about tanning. Yes. that is
Just what I would like to do. but wilh a
few thousand dollars one cannot do very much.
The balance of my money has not yet come and
I believe It would be unwise to Invest until
the remainder is in sight, at least, so it seems
to me. So I am at sea. so to speak, in re
gard to what course to pursue.
Naturally one would be a little shaky about
investing ' money. . I may go to work again for
a short time. I dislike an Idle life so much.
I must do something. , I happen to be one ot
those strange creatures that* cannot be Idle. If
I; leave the city will, not get out to Mrs. Hu
bert's March 5 to see you. I wrote to you that I
would stay, at home Wednesday evening. Feb
ruary 19. to see you. I stayed at home Wednes
day. Thursday. Friday and Saturday evenings,
expecting you â¢ would call. Â¦ as I did not hear
from you. -Well, it is all right, it Is not to
be, so be it. The evening you called to return
the book, it -that stupid man only had man
ners enough to invite you in the dining-room
I would have seen ' you. Of course I saw you
at: the corner of Twentieth and Castro that
evening, but did not" think about calling at
Sixteenth. - as I knew you were going to call
on Mrs. Hubert with your friend. .
I have not said anything to Mrs. Hubert
about what I am to do, neither do I Intend
to any./ jnore than to call and say good-by
Monday, March 3. I judge from the tone of
your letter of February 25 that you have very
little confidence in me because I failed to let
you know where I was. Well. I explained
all â¢ that in my last letter to you. 'I did not
think that your faith was so easily shaken.
Hardly expected that from you, believing you
"to be much superior to the average man. So
I think it best not to make promises. In case
anything should happen you will not again ac
cuse me of not keeping my word. My motives
have been the best, although you misconstrued
them. . - Â¦ . . ...
The following is a copy of one of the
letters written to Smith by Mrs. Hamilton,

tell and moved his trunk there. Subsequently
I moved to my present home and saw little of
Mr. Smith until about three weeks ago, when
I met him on the .street. We chatted for a
while and he asked it he could call on me. I
acquiesced, but when he called the first time
through an error ot a party who opened the
door he was allowed to go without seeing me.
He wrote me several letters and I answered
them. The"y are the ones which were found ln
his rooms and are purely of a business nature,
relating to the Investment of my money. A
â¢week or two ago I 'saw Mr. Smith and Garratt
going up Twentieth street, near Castro. They
were going. to call at Mrs. Rubert's on Castro
street, who was quite friendly with us all.
The last -time I saw Mr. Smith he was in
excellent humor. He talked glibly and blithe
ly and seemed- to. enjoy, his usual high spirits.
I am satisfied that he had no love entangle
ments that would cause him to make away with
himself. 1 He may have been ln love early in
his youth, but if that is so he never men
tioned it to me. I am quite at a loss to ad
vance any motive for a murder. He had no
enemies that I know.cf and he had absolutely
no troubles. 'He was a thrifty man and always
had. a little money saved up.

ratt eaid he had. not met Smith as agresd on
that day nor on the following day because he
was busy at his work at the Hotel Ple&santon.
Now that I see by The Call that Garratt never
worked at the Pleaeanton I am reminded of
the fact that Garratt was extremely nervous
for some reason and seemed anxious t<? find out
Just bow much I knew of Smith's disappear
ance. He said he would make inquiries as to
Smith's whereabouts and let me know within
a day or two what he might" find out. The
woman took no part in our conversation. When
Garratt left he tald he had to be on duty be
fore 11 o'clock that morning and -he had little
time to make a rearch. In the letter contain
ing the money order for 91 was the statement
that the writer, who was Smith, according- to
Garratt. bad Issued a money order for $15 to
& Chicago firm on Thursday. The receipt for
this order was found in a little book belonging
to Smith, but there was no receipt for a
money order for $1 which Garratt claimed he
received.
Smith was a cleanly 'and orderly man. He
read a great deal and his hobby was the pur
chase of books on socialism and biography.
He studied medical works also, if I'm, not mis
taken.- He seemed to be ambitious and said
he intended to be eornebody tome day. He
never had any callers except one day some
weeks ago. Smith said it was a friend o^ his.
From recent developments in the case 1 am
convinced the man who called that day was
Garratt. ' s
WAS AN ORDEULY MAN.
Smith's custom -when going anywhere when
off duty, as was the case on the day of his
disappearance, was to return to his room 'and
.chance his clothing. He got home about 2
o'clock and remained about thirty minutes.
He appeared to be In a gray humor an<1
whistled while moving about Ms room. Then
he came Into my sitting-room and presented
tnt with a bunch of violets. l}e talked about
tbe condition of the weather and expressed
the belief that it would rain and that it would
not be very pleasant to be out in the storm.
Then he spoke about having- tickets for the
Columbia and Fischer's theaters and said a
young lady acquaintance of ours might have
the Columbia seats if she desired them. He
left the room then' and re-entered his cham
ber. I heard his moving about and a few
minutes later the front door siammed. When
I entered his room I saw his glasses lying
upon the table. His books were scattered
about and his mouse-colored gloves were on
the bed. His overcoat hung on a hook in. the
closet. Everything v/as Just as if he had left
the place with - the probable intention of re
turning witlitn a few minutes.
Additional details relative to the dis
appearance of Hal Smith from his room
at E37 Bush street on the 7th inst. were
furnished by Mrs. Kate Mackey, the land
lady of the missing man, yesterday. She
said to a Call reporter:

The history of the Market-street Rail

Mr. Smith would never leave his room in
the condition he did if he did not intend
to return. Garratt roomed here at my
house for about a week. When Mr. Smith

was the trouble. He told me that every

It was on this statute that the transfer
of the.pnoperty of the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad to the Santa Fe Railroad was
effected. Attorney Atterbury and Tlrey
Jj.- Ford decided that with this- deal as a
precedent they could make no mistake in
the transfer of the Market Street Rail
road to the United Railroads of San-Fran
cisco.
When the Baltimore Syndicate pur
chased the San Mareo lines last vear the
.same legal action In connection with the
transfer was taken. . .
The ratification of the stockholders of
both the Market, Sutro and Sutter Street
railways was simply to comply with a
clause in the act which says: . /,' :.-
An act amending the Civil Code of Cal
ifornia, known as section No. 4i)4. was
approved on March 22, 1899, authorizing the
sale by any railroad company owning any
railroad in this State of its property and
franchise to any other railroad company,
whether organized under the laws of this
State or of any other State. This was
the law that the attorneys of the Balti
more syndicate acted under.
I There is a clause, however, In this act
"that such sale, conveyance and transfer
shall be made within three years from the
date this act shall take effect." As the
act was passed on March 22. 1899, the syn
dicate had only a few days In which to
make the conveyance legal.
Law Authorizes Sale.
The meeting yesterday was purely
formal, -only about . a half-dozen being
present. Attorney Atterbury and'Eugene
Delano of the firm of Brown Bros, were
on hand for the syndicate, and H. E.
Huntington, I. W- 'â¢ Hellman ' and George
B. Willcvttt . on behalf of the Market
street Railway. The legal end of the big
transfer is very interesting. It was tho
intention' of the , Baltimore syndicate not
to take hold of the street car systems u:i-'
til March 28, but it was compelled to take
possession of the properties at once upon
legal grounds. â¢...â¢..â - .^ "_'.'Â¦

IDEA OF SUICIDE
KIEL, March 19.â The German battle
rhlp Kaiser Wllhelm II. having on board
Emperor William and Admiral Prince
Henry of Prussia, arrived here at 5:30

welcomed by the firing of salutes and
cheers from the naval squadron in these

landed at Kiel at dusk and joined Prin
cess Henry and his sons. That which
took place between the royal brothers is,
of course, not a matter concerning which
those surrounding Emperor "William and
Prince Henry have been taken into the
royal conference further than to know
that the brothers had a talk to-day last
ing several hours, and that Prince Henry
told Emperor William his experiences
irom the beginning to the end of his trip.
The members of the Prince's party
â¢were much -amused vrhile on their trav
els at the calls of "Speech," "Speech."
from the crowds collected at wayside
places, and the cries of "How's your
brother William?"
Tafi. only occasion when the least alarm
for the Prince's saietv was felt Was when
a raember of the party saw a man enter
the Prince's car at one end while Prince
â¢Henry was on the platform at the other
end bowing to the crowd. This man was
ordered out of the car. He hesitated, and
then withdrew. A few minutes later he
was seen working his way through the
crowd in order to get nearer the Prince.
This man wore a long coat, under which
anything might have been concealed. A
member of the Prince's staff pointed out
iMs person to John E. Wilkie. chief of
ihe secret service, who accompanied the
Prince on his trip, who at once said:
"Why. that is one of my men."
Prince Henry does not know why he
did not visit the stockyards at Chicago,
except that he was advised by Wilkie
that It would be better to omit this part
of the programme, as the Polish work
raen at the stockyards might create , a
oisturbance. \*"': Â¦

The publication by The Call of the facts
in the case resulted in several interesUng
developments yesterday. A waiter named
Clancy who worked with Garratt in Oak-
I land for some months appeared at the
i Palace during tho day and volunteered
I the information that Garratt was "no

] in his career which would be of interest to
I the police. Clancy's statement was not
taken by a responsible party and when a
Call reporter sought him at his residence,
319 Minna street, last night it was found
that Clancy was in Oakland. From other
sources it was learned, however, that Gar
ratt did not bear the best reputation and
that details concerning his conduct would
be furnished within a few days.
Another fact tending to show that
Smith Was foully dealt with and that the
motive was robbery developed yesterday
when it was learned that Smith had two
money orders in his possession at the time
of his disappearance. One of there was
for nearly $100 and the other for a lesser

his own story he was employed at the

money order therefore did not exist. Last

He said France was willing to do so iÂ£

England and Germany negatived the re

had been a trifle strained owing to ma
conflicting: irade interests of the two
countries and because of Germany's in

reasons that led up to Prince Henry's re

Professor Wheeler next paid a high
tribute to Secretary John Hay. whom he
characterized as a great statesman and
diplomat. He regretted that he was not

on the teaching of children. He favored
teaching pupils things that would benefit

TACOMA, March 19.â United States Sen
ator George Turner, who was elected as
a Populist five years ago and is now
ranked as a Democrat, is making a quiet
but vigorous effort to bring about his re
election by the next State Legislature, to
be chosen in November, j Senator Turner
came out from Washington two weeks
ago to inspect the commencement of the
work on a 300-ton smelter, which one of
his. mining companies Is erecting on the;
Sullivan group of mines in Kootenai. He
also has been making a tour of the State
and conferring everywhere with leading
workers in the Democratic party.
Though Washington is strongly Repub
lican under normal conditions, it re-elected
a Democratic Governor at the last elec
tion. Senator Turner and his friends be
lieve there is a possibility, If not a proba
bility, of his being able to elect enough
members of the Legislature to insure a
Democratic majority. This belief ia based
on the bitter factional ffght in the Re
publican party, now beincr waged between
the supporters of Senator Foster and
Banker Levl Ankeny of Walla Walla on
the one hand and former Senator John L.
Wilson of Spokane on the other. .
The feeling la bo strong that tho Legis
lative candidates of either faction are
likely to be knifed by the other, making
it possible for strong Democratic candi
dates to win in many districts. The preit
ent purpose of Senator Turner and his
advisers is to lay plans for taking full
advantage of this situation.

It is ciaimed by those who have seen
him that he is not more than 30 years of
age, tall, well formed, robust and strong.
Trie has long . black hair and his face is
covered by a short beard. He sleeps in
trees and hollow trunks and not long in
one place, as his food supplies have been
found in various spots.

his appearance. He is garbed in \ skins
and rags and generally flees at the sight
of a human being, but in the past two
weeks he has at times come down from

at ranch houses. He appears to watch his

POSSE TO SEEK
THE WILD MAN
The second murder, in | which Oliver
Dotson. father of the condemned man,
was the victim, for plotting which Dotson
is to be hanged, it is charged was done
by James McArthur. who was hanged for
the crime last September.
Dotson was In for life for the first crime
and it was charged that Dotson and Mc-
Arthur hatched a plot within the prison
walls whereby McArthur, who3e torn;
was shortly to expire, wa3 to murdei
Dot son's father and pjn a purported con
fession on the body. This eonfe3slon, it
was supposed, would clear Dotson of the
firBt .crime and give him his liberty.
Dotson makes the .sensational state
ir.ent that in the plot McArthur was to
kill Ward.cn Conley and attempt a gen
eral release of the convicts. Dotson says
through him this design was frustrated.
Dotson declares McArthur confessed to
him the murder of a man whose remains
were found near Central Park in 1S86. His
name .was Allen and his folks resided in
Walla Walla, Waeh.
BUTTE, March 19.â A special to : the
Miner from Deer Lodge penitentiary says
that Convict Dotson,' who is awaiting the
sentence of death, has made a statement

his Innocence of the two murders with
which he is charged.
1-ne first murder, that of Eugene Culli
nane, on August 8, li'JS, he asserts, was
committed by Oliver Benson and ElLs
Persinger alone, he being in Helena at
the time. Benson's confession of the
crime was that Benson remained in hid

Tvro- Justices Dissent.
Â¦ The opinion. Is written by. Justice Mc-
Farland. It is very brief. .The: argu
ments of the attorneys. for the executors
are given little consideration/ . The deci
sion' is practically affirming the position
of the court on the case which involved
the real property. When- the realty de
cision was . handed down it was thought
among the attorneys in general - that ; the
heirs .would get control of the whole for
tune. The executors could not of, course
relinquish their claims on the personalty
without a fight.'- '
Â¦ Of -course ; there are cases, some of -which' are'
cited by appellants, where provisions about
personalty in . a trust have , . been, enforced
while provisions In the same trust about realty
were held to be invalid, but they were cases
â¢ â¢'"â¢â¢ where It was said "The teat is whether
the upholding of one part and the rejection of
another will defeat the presumed wishes of
the testator and r Â¦â¢â¢ ,* ...Â» where ,. â¢ â¢ â¢ it la
possible, to" cut' but , the .invalid'..' provisions- so.
as to leave Intact the parts that are valid and
to Â¦ preserve the general plan of ; the testator.
Under these conditions to hold that the tes
tator, if he had known- that his attempted
disposition of the realty was invalid and that,
upon hls : death,' his vast amount- of real prop
erty, worth many millions of dollars, wtfuld
go Immediately- in' fee Eimple to his children
and wouM have given to them also the income
of his Â¦ personal â¢ property would ' be 'to : indulge
in a- most Impossible supposition Â¦ and to vio
late the settled law on that subject. . '
The court then says in closing
The court then reviews the provisions
of the will. The trustees were given au
thority to improve the real property with
the personal. They could sellreal estate
or they could' buy real estate with the
personal property.' The trustees were di
rected to give the three children the net
income. That" could be either large or
small,' as suited their tastes. It was in
tended, that the children should never get
the corpus of the estate." When they
should die the fortune was to go to their
children, except those of Charles. .
Reviews Provisions of Will.
It is evident, therefore, that the court in
tended to decide, and did decide (in the pre
\-loua decision) that the Invalid trust defeated
the , whole scheme â¢ of the Â¦ testator { and left
standing 1 no otherwise â¢ valid provisions which
were not inseparably interwoven with those
which were invalid. The- decision, it is true,
did not expressly mention the personal Â¦ prop
erty because it happened that the, decree, of
distribution there appealed from dealt only
with the real property; but It would as clearly
have swept away the claims of the trustees
to the personality if that had been in the way,
as it did their claims to the life estate. In
deed, the decision applies with even more fore?
to the personal property than to the life estate.
In the will there Is no distinction between
the realty and the personalty. They are both
untied In one Inseparable trust.
CHILDREN OF THE I^ATE JAMES G. FAIR,: WHO COME INTO UNRE
STRICTED POSSESSION OF A F ORTUNE WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO
BE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTE EN MILLION DOLLARS.
James Angus. Thomas Carothers and
William S. Goodfellow were named by
James G. Fair as the executors of his
will. At; trustees of the property they
have derived a rich income. Naturally.
they did not want to hand the control of
the fortune over to the heirs. They nave
put up a hard tight to have the will.-de-
Such a disposition of - the property
pleased none of the relatives who -were
left behind. Litigation was begun en
fcvery eide. Nettie Craven tried to get a
fchare of the fortune and failed. The Su
preme Court a year ago declared that the
trust clause was invalid in so far as the
real estate was concerned. The capital
ist's attempt to convey the realty to
grandchildren over the heads of his son
and daughters was found to be illegal.
Yesterday the same tribunal decided that
such a disposition of the personal prop
erty would also be illegal.
The title to the properly has been in
cijsrute ever since the death of James G.
Fair, in 1S34. The dead had hardly been
laid away before the living commenced
battling: for the millions left behind. Fair
cild not want to ' trust his fortune to bis
children. In his will he made provision
that they should divide the income during
the terms of their natural lives. When
they should die the principal was to go to
the children of the two girls. Any off
spring of Charles Fair was cut out of the
will entirely. . .
fortune from the grave has utterly
failed. The tireless efforts of a score of
the most brilliant lawyers that California
lias produced have succeeded in defeating
the purposes of the dead multi-million
aire. The three children. Charles. The
resa. Oclrlchs and Virginia Fair Vander
'uilt, can do what they will with the $18,-

|l the will of James G. Fair, part
II and parcel. His plan to control

Mrs. Craven has : spent money â¢- to no
avail. The executors are disappointed "at
the result of the .litigation. The Fair
children". have spent nearly $2,000,000 in
galningr their rights. ,. ;,
But there are . people who have reaped
rich\ benefits.'/ They are the lawyers. It is
no wonder that they sigh mournfully that
litigation over the Fair will Is a thing of
the past.- Judge Paterson is said to have
gathered in about $10,000. Judge Hayne
went his way with $25,000. James HVBudd
got a snug little fortune of $100,000. The
executors have to be content with only a
mere pittance of $115,000. Attorney Gar
ret McBnerney received as a reward for
his services the sum of $135,000. The. law
firm of Pierson, Mitchell & Carotherswas
turned . away with $270,000. The firm of
Lloyd & : Wood got approximately $1,000.-
OOO.but out of this sum they have to- pay
good round fees to Bishop & Wheeler,
Judgft Garber. and Wilspn & "Wilson.
Knight & Heggerty will get about $300,000,

these then shall we commence to see the ladder

those whose tottering footsteps to eternity are

- If the proposed National Health "Commission ac
complish one-half what its advocates promise jt will
well repay whatever cost it may entail upon the Gov
ernment Even if large allowance be made for exag
geration and undue expectations on the part of over
sanguine promoters of the new plan, it will still be
worth a trial. Certairily.it is time the issue -were
$ealt with as a national question. " Plagues and pes
tilences do not respect State lines, and consequently
cannot be so effectively mastered and checked by
separate State action, as by the; Federal Government.
The proposed legislation, â¢ then, may not be perfect,
but it. is in the right direction and should be acted
aDon at this session.
Â¦
AMONG the bills before Congress which may
be justly looked upon as rnatters of impor
tance are two relating to the conservation of
public health by the establishment of a national com
mission to supervise all matters that afe likely to
affect it Each State arid Territorial Board of Health
is to have a representative on the commission, which
in its scope of action is to be' thoroughly national.
The advocates of the proposed commission assert
that upon its establishment it will be possible to do
away with the old system of quarantine by substi
tuting for it a system of coast and interior disin*
fection which will prove more effective in dealing
with epidemic's and at the same time be less difficult
an&Jess. injurious to trade in its operation.
The question of dealing with infectious diseases is
of course a complex one, but it would seem in. our
stage pf civilization to be quite possible for sanitary
experts, backed with official authority, to devise,
some better means of protecting public health than
by the old quarantine system, which has comedown
to us from immemorial time. The very establish
ment of a quarantine. gives rise to a panic that is
often far worse than the disease against which the
quarantine was set up. Moreover, nearly every
quarantine of a city of considerable size serio'tisly in
terferes with trade, injures industry and causes a loss
of Avork and wages to many thousands of people.
--We-otrrsdves had an- experience of some of the
evils of the quarantine- system during the scare
about the bubonic plague, but our troubles were
slight in ;comp2Tison, to those which repeatedly have
fallen upon the Eastern and -Southern: States by rea
son of smallpox or cf yellow fever. Every time a
serious outbreak of cne of those diseases occurs
trade is interrupted, and sometimes so great is the
alarm that communities refuse to permit the .run
ning of trains to their depots from an irifecÂ£ed dis
trict. In short, business is at times-brought alrhpst
to a standstill in panic-stricken cities,: arid the 'whole'
country suffers more or less in consequence. V

" A well-known manufacture^ of musical
Instruments in Germanyâ Max Freyerâ .
has introduced a process for making vio
lins from clay. These fiddles are of th<s
ordinary pattern, but are cast in molds,
so that each Instrument Is an exact coun
terpart of its fellow. It Is saidâ but It 13
somewhat hard to believeâ that the porce
lain body acts as a better resonator than
one of wood, and that the tone of the in
strument Is 'therefore singularly pure and
full. The same Inventor la also making
mandolins of china, clay, and It seems that
they are much appreciated la southern
countries, where' the instrument lg re
garded more seriously than it is in Brit
ain. The obvious disadvantage of a mu
sical instrument being made of china'clay
,is the brittleness of that material, aj
well' as "its weight," but' both these draw
backs seem 'to have been forgotten. For
some time yre have heard rumors of most
excellent violins being made of aluminum,
and this metal, from its extreme lightness
and other qualities, would seen to ba
admirably adapted to such a purpose.

- Pontifical commissions on the Holy Scriptures are not new. The only signifi
cant part of the. present commission is Its recognition of the fact that there are
modern questions affecting Holy Writ. The questions before the commission are
fundamental, far reaching and tremendously important, say American Catholics.
On his return to America he was engaged ln : parochial work in New York,
becoming canonically resident of that archdiocese. After two or three years he
was called to the chair of sacred Scripture and dogmatic theology at Mount St
Mary's College, Emmiltsburg, Md. He was called to the Catholic University be
fore it's opening. In 1889, and 1 spent two years In Paris arid Berlin,' devoting him
self to further study of the Holy Scriptures. ' He traveled In Egypt, Palestine,
Syria, Asia. Minor and Greece, and for the last ten years has been in active work
in the Catholic University at Washington as professor of sacred Scripture. The
English speaking part pf Catholicity is further represented on the commission
by the Rev. Dr. Robert 'F. Clark of the archdiocese of Westminster, England, and
the Rev. David Fleming, the Irish scholar who is at present the superior general
of the ' Franciscan order.
THE Very Rev. Dr. Charles. P. Grannan, who has been named by the Pope
as the American consultor on the Pontifical -Commission on Questions Con
cerning: Holy Writ, is a priest of the archdiocese of New Tcrk.' H13 ap
pointment gives immense satisfaction to American Catholics, first, be
cause It recognizes for the first time In such conspicuous degree the scholarship
of America, and, second, because it pays honor to their favorite educational pro
ject, the Catholic University of America. " The Rev. Dr. Grannan is air Americaji
'by birth and education.- Hla classical course was begun at St Thomas College,
Bardstown, !Ky., and finished at Montreal. He then went to. the Urban College
of the Propaganda, Rome, where for seven years he studied philosophy and the

There is one infinite advantage which the human parasite has over the insect. There
is a. conscience within him which he can never wholly silence . and through. its prompt
ings he may be brought to repent and to atone. The clerical parasite so long as he re
mains young is not beyond the hope of good men. There is a chance that the dignities by
which he is surrounded, the. influence of venerable men. whom in his folly he has derided,
but who with a high solicitude are still willing to help him back to the better, paths, may
in the end affect him more deeply. than the shouts. ;and clamors of mobs;, and so through
those good influences he may be led to see' the error of his way ."and, return to;'rendet
faithful, service where "he is now but a parasite. Humanity is not 'severe upon those ' who
truly repent, arid those who have become the wqrst by the corruption of : the best have
only to" be true to their better selves and they will yet live : to. fulfill the promise of their
youth and win once more the praise of their superiors. V : Â¦:'
Upon that truth all human parasites should ponder in the silences of .the night
when the praise of fools has died out from their ears. Let. them then remember- they are
not wholly lost.
Once having reached. and accepted the degradation of .a parasite's life, the worst
characteristics of the man's nature rapidly develop into a swollen and, abnormal growth.
For him thereafter the veracities, the dignities and even the decencies of life have no mean
ing.. He not only loses the serene grace- of clerical dignity, but he abandons even the
common courtesies of a gentleman. In his eagerness to 'keep himself before the public
and to retain the praise of the unreflecting which has now grown to be almost necessary
to his life, he speaks on all possible occasions, and in each succeeding . speech goes fur
ther and further in his mad efforts to win the applause of the vulgar. He becomes a com
mon scold. ;His invective sinks to billingsgate. *" Hardly;, any one of sufficient- eminence
to be noted in the community escapes his assault. To use a phrase which Charles Sumner
has made classic, "He casts the loose expectoration of his., eloquence now upon this man
and now upon that/' Respect for the church in which he â¢still poses as a cleric compels
men to submit, in silence. Even where he is condemned he is not always named, for there
is a reverence for the sacredness of the church which prevents men from assisting a vain
glorious parasite in making a public scandal of his career even when he seeks it by false
hood and insult. \ - - -â¢!'â¢ -.
The evolution of. a clerical parasite is an easy study in human history. Given a
young cleric with an attractive presence, personal magnetism, easy assurance with a showy
talent for speaking and writing, but possessed of no deep reverence for his calling, nor re
spect for his own dignity, animated by an inordinate vanity, greedy of praise and delight
ing in. flattery, and having no moral scruple nor well balanced judgment, and his de
velopment sooner or later into a parasite on the church is inevitable. '
Theprocess is as simple. as it is natural. The young cleric pleases his venerable
superiors by his youth; his talent arid his seeming zeal. They praise him and promote him.
He rises rapidly over the heads of older men and- soon attains a conspicuous position.
Once there; however, his innate weakness displays itself.' . His superiors observe he is not
equal to the dignity assigned him, that he is more avid of cheap praise than of x wise coun
sel. They rebuke him and he resents it. In his vanity he persuades himself that they are
jealous of him, and'it becomes necessary to remove him from his high position. Irritated
by the condemnation of his superiors he turns for consolation to the. praise and plaudits
of the ignorant. He learns to love flattery ill its coarsest form;! Â£J e appeals more and
more to the rabble, becomes the sycophant of the mob. Swollen with a vanity that rot
tens as it swells, he arrives at last to a point where he mocks at dignity, derides superiority,
scoffs at men in the highest office, and by his offensiveness of speech compels his su
periors to dismiss him trom all official position whatever. Thus, dismissed he is no longer
of any service to the church by which he lives. He has become a ,parasite, , ,'â¢"..
A maxim th at has come down to us from the ancients ! says : "The worst is : pro
duced by the corruption of the best.": The human parasite is by that rule more pernicious
than the insect. Those which prey upon the higher institutions ; of men are worse than
those that prey upon the lower. Those that fasten and fatten upon the church are then
the most pernicious of all,, for they, are "of the breed of men who distort religion' itself into
viciousness and transform a sacred office into a safe nest where they can lie in comparative
security and sting with impunity, until the' stinging becomes . intolerable and the church
casts forth the pest. , ; - 7 : \
T â¢ T PON every stately growth, prolific nature 'fastens â¢jsome" kmd of; parasite. Crea-

N-f-*^' physical World. ' The'^nost august institutions among qen are affected -by para

AMUSEMENTS.The police- at the Hall of Justice are
investigating two daring burglaries com
mitted Tuesday night within the shadow
of thÂ« Hall of Justice. The Vesuvio
restaurant, at 630 Montgomery street, waa
robbed' some time during the- hours of
darkness, and money and goods to tha
extent of $200 were taken. A short tlmo
afterward the store of Quong Yuen Hlng
Company, on Dupont street, was entered
and its owners suffered a loss of about
$175.
The police are of the belief that tha
crimes were committed by the same
crooks and pronounce them the work of a
gang who have been operating at North
Beach. Cash registers and tills were
forced with "jimmies'" in each case and
the thieves, not satisfied with monetary
plunder, carried away the most valuable
goods they could find in the establish
ments. Â¦ .Â¦''.-"
The Vesuvio restaurant was entered
from the front," the burglars cutting out
a screen ventilator over one of the doors.
How -they accomplished this without de
tection is a mystery to the officers. When
the burglars reached Dupont street they
smashed one of the large panes in the
show window and gained an entrance to
the Chinese store.
From the restaurant $43 in cash waa
stolen in addition to imported cigars and
wines valued at $163. High-priced cloth,
ornaments and. $30 in coin were extracted
from the store 'on Dupont street. â¢

been landing men, arms and supplies just
as fast as they could, and with the full
and free permission of the Chinese Impe

"Early In June Vice Admiral Seymour

Rear Admiral Louis Kempff returned
yesterday from his 'exciting -experiences
in the far East, where he commanded the
American rfleet at bombardment -of
the Taku forts, and where 'â¢ he pursued
such -a course of . justice and < fairness
toward the Chinese Government as . to
have since won the approval of the dlplo
! mats of this and. other; countries. ' Ad
miral Kempff returned; to his home in
Oakland after, more' than: two years' ab
sence on duty In the'Orient, during which
time . he commanded American squadrons
in Chinese, Philippine and Japanese wa
ters. He arrived . on the Pacific Mail
steamer, Peking, and as sobn'as he was
released from quarantine Joined his fam
| ily at the Hotel Metropole in Oakland.
He will remain there for a short time be
fore'he proceeds to. Washington to make
a report in person to the Federal Govern
ment upon matters connected with the
Chinese situation and : the conditions in
Manila. - . â¢ : . .
Admiral Kempff was relieved at Yoko
: Iiama by Rear Admiral Wilds, he having
served more than the usual time allotted
to officers on foreign service. The trans
fer ol commands was made on March 1
in - Yokohama harbor, and Admiral
Kempff boarded the Pacific Mail steamer,
'. whicn left on that\day for the United
States. .
This is â¢ the admiral's first visit to his
native country since his active service
before.Taku, when his refusal to heip
bombard the Chinese forts put the United
States in a position to dictate terms .'to
the rest of the world in' the complicated
conditions that subsequently arose in
China. This was a home-coming for; the
.admiral, for he left, the position of com-'
mandant of the Mare Island navy 'yard
to take command of the Asiatic squadron.
He had been for many years in Califor
nia, and left his family here when he went
to\ the Orient.
y Reasons for His Course.
"My decision" at Taku was based upon
the naval regulations of the United
States," said Admiral Kempff modestly
last night. "These regulations are very
clear. I decided that .the Chinese Gov
ernment had . committed no act of war
and that we were not justified in firing
upon the Chinese flag or making the de
mand for the surrender of the Taku forts,
and so I refused to join in the bombard
ment.
"While we were the last to fire upon the
Chinese flag, we were the first to land
troops in Tientsin. " I arrived off Taku
I think, on May 27, with the Newark as
my flagship. At that time there was
communication with Peking and in all
directions, but there were rumors of trou
ble in the air. The foreigners at Tientsin
were nervous, for there had been a mas
sacre there some years before, and we
were asked to land troops. In order to
understand the situation at Taku it must
be known that the water is very shoal,
and at best there is but thirteen feet on
the: bar. The result was that the big
ships had to lay twelve miles off shore.
Only a few gunboats of. the lightest dratt
took part. -:.:,
"Not a big vessel fired a" shot. I re
ceived word from Tientsin asking that a
guard be sent. I at once applied for per
mission to land some of my troops, which
was granted by the Chinese Government,
and at 5 o'clock on the morning of the fol
lowing day I had something over 100
marines and sailors under arms. We only
had fifty marines all told in the Ameri
can fleet that had arrived at that. time.
At- 6 o clock .Â«thls -company embarked 'In
our boats, towed by launches. I went
with the boats I in person, â¢ and the whole
fleet- got stuck on the bar. We did not
know the channel and the water was very
low. We saw a number of Chinese junks
and sampans and hired the entire fleet,
loaded our men on them and managed to
reach Taku on the flat-bouomed boats.
- 'There we found there was some trouble
on the railroad; to Tientsin and rather
than wait we hired tugs from the Taku
f.?M T^?. tsln L Je hter Company,; and the
little Chinese- fleet, towed by tugs and
loaded with American sailors and ma
rines, were taken up the river to Tientsin
They arrived during the day and wer#
the first armed, contingent of foreign
fighting men to reach that city. All of
the foreign element -tufned out and gave
them a < royal welcome. The Japanese
had landed seventeen men, but ours was
the first contingent of whites and the first
of any considerable size that arrived. â¢ â¢
As this was expected to be made a test
case in jthe interest of hydraulic mining
much interest was evinced, but Sargent's
peculiar, position made action by the Min
ers' Association impossible.
George C. Sargent appeared before the
committee in reference to asking aid of
the Miners' Association to fight an in
junction issued by the Superior Court of
Nevada County, at the instance of the
Anti-Debris Association. It was held that
Sargent operated a - hydraulic-- mine
which emptied debris into a tributary of
a navigable stream. The Miners' Associ
ation could not help Sargent, as the in
junction was served before he took out a
permit. Had the injunction been -served
after the permit . was granted then, the
association would have been in a better
position to take action. The association
agreed to give him all the moral support
possible and hoped he would be -able to
arrange satisfactorily with the Debris
Commission.
As the Legislature does not meet until
shortly before the opening of the fair, and
the appropriation is certain to be forth
coming, the Miners' Association will lend
all. aid possible between now and then
to-tho- securing of specimens. - The secre
tary was instructed to send a printed let
ter to the Boards of Supervisors in every
county, asking them to appoint some per
son to gather specimens and ship them
byWelu,- Fargo & Co., which- carries
them free of charge, to the Mining Bu
reau in San Francisco, where they jwill be
held to await the appropriation from the
Legislature. . The -Miners' Association
will not be I responsible in any way for
loss of specimens. The State must bear
all expense. . .
Specimens for St. Louis Fair.
The committee came to the conclusion
that rather than .try te push through any
new, bills it would use its utmost efforts
in getting through the three above named,
which were becoming stale.
The association tendered a vote of
thanks to the company that donated! its
stone for the Sloat monument at Monte
rey. The sum of $180 was ordered sent
to Major Sherman to cover cost of moving
and setting in place the stone. *
In regard to the invitation from the St.
Louis Fair of 1903 to the miners of Cali
fornia to open and maintain an exhibit,
It .was resolved that the duty of getting
an exhibit at the fair rested with the
State Mining Bureau. It was estimated
that $10,000 would be necessary to main
tain the exhibit at St. Louis and that an
appropriation from the State Legislature
for \ the amount would have to be ob
tained. -
No resolution was sent on the $150,000
river and harbor bill, as it was thought
to be quite safe.
Resolved. That the mining industry of this
country,", with its enormous output ot raw ma
terial, its tremendous significance to the in
dustrial prosperity or the nation and its vast
possibilities of luture development warrants
and demands the governmental protection and
aid Â¦ that > can be adequately extended â¢ only
through a Cabinet department of the executive
branch of the Government. Â¦ Be it turther '
Resolved, That we heartily indorse the bill
now ' pending in Congress Â¦ .that we create a
Cabinet Department ot Mines and Mining, and
in behalf of the miners of California we de
mand the passage of said bill.
Heartily Indors* the Bill.
Resolved, That we most earnestly urge upon
our. Senators and Representatives In congress
to Ube their utmost cu'orts to secure the enact
ment Â¦ ot the fco-called mineral lands bill, now
pending in Congress, to the _ end that there
may.be a prompt,, effectual and nnai classifi
cation ,_and segregation ot the mineral lands
vrithln the railroad : land branch of California,
and that such mineral lands may again be
thrown open to exploration and purchase as
part of the public domain. No effort should be
spared to procure the enactment of this leg
islation at this session of Congress.
" On a motion of Senator Davis, the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted, and the
secretary was directed to telegraph them
at once Â« to the California ' Congressional
delegation at Washington:
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California : State Miners'
Association last night at the Union
League Club in the Palace Hotel, import
ant business was transacted which" is, no
doubt, of exceeding interest to the miners
of : California.. â¢
As a. better means . of labeling it was
decided that the trade names used in
designating the goods should be more in
the nature of information, so that the
consumer would know exactly what he
was buying. It was therefore agreed that
scientificâ nomenclature -should be re
placed by common -terms. The sentiment
of the manufacturers will be ascertained
bef6re. any definite action is taken and

b6r6'had promised the hearty co-operation

sociation. In- the Health Board's endeavor
to compel the sale -of pure foods only in
the local market. Â¦ . .
It was decided also to endeaver to bring
about the voluntary withdrawal from the
market j of condemned goods, or goods
declared not up to the standard. Should
the manufacturer or producer refuse to
withdraw . the goods the Health Board
will immediately move in the prosecution
of J the offender. To that end it was
deemed advisable to have the standards
ratified by the commercial interests in
volved. . . ; . Â¦ .
The next question considered was the
methods of labeling goods. It was agreed
that only foods coming up to the stand
ard-would be entitled to the label, "pure
food." . All others must state distinctly
the ingredients used in their manufacture.
For example, ,if currant Jelly had mixed
with: it apple jelly It must eo state on the
labels, ; although the latter commodity is
not harmful. ; . â¢
Withdrawal of Condemned Goods'.
City Chemist Green opened proceedings
by explaining that his department was
prepai ing certain hxed standards for
every .variety of food sold in the market.
It was desired- before these standards be
adopted that they be sanctioned by. the
manutacturers ot the particular grade of
goods affectecL a To that end it was in
tended to- submit them to manufacturers
who would be in a position to advise a's
to what constitutes the proper f standards.

and Claud -Kagee did everything possible
to make our trip a success."
The system of decoys is a most inge
nious one. I The men who organize the
shoots are said to be - remarkably clever,
at calling the geese. They have made a
lifelong study of it, and it is impossible
to tell them from the original at a short
distance. In addition to this they have a
number of geese which, they have 'tamed
for the purpose. These are taken to the
shooting grounds in crates. They usually
pick out the white ones, as they are tho
more readily distinguished by the geesre
flying about. They- clip a joint from one
wing, which prevents their joining the
other geese. They also have a fine net
about two feet; high, with which they
fence m the live decoys. The birds walk
about naturally in this -; lnclosure and
The same pits are seldom used twice
during the season, as the blrd3 locate
them quickly.- The placing of the shooters
and the live decoys is done long before
daylight, Â¦ as if the teams and men are
seen by the geese they will not approach
the spot.
make no attempt to escape.
In addition to these the first Iot of geese
killed are also used as decoys. These are
held out by forked sticks, an effort being
made to show them in & natural position,
as the presence of one. dead goose
stretched out on the ground will often
scare away a lot of birds-. - When the sup
ply of forked sticks is exhausted the birds
are placed in a sitting posture, with their
heads under their wing3, as though asleep.
The work of "calling " the geese is so se
vere a strain : on the men that they dp it
on alternate days. On the day they are
not "calling" they are out digging pits
for the netft day's shoot and looking up
desirable locations."

The purpose of the charter framers in pro
viding that consideration in the matter of pro
motions shall be given to seniority of service/
was, no doubt, to givÂ« to those men who pre
sumably had most experience an advantage.
o\ p er those less experienced. But thia expe
rience must be as a regular policeman to be
availing ; it mufft be such experience as a man
subjected to the discipline of the regular de
partment, and who had performed duties there
in, could only acquire.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion with
the Civil Service Commission yesterday,
after considering the language of the
charter and the history of the park po
lice, that service in the park police should
not be given consideration in rating for
seniority of service for promotion In the
Police Department. The commission de
fired to know whether in awarding credit
for "seniority of service" In examinations
for promotion in the Police Department
consideration should be given to service
in the park police prior to January 8,
U<00, when, under the charter, the park
police became part of the regular Police
Department. The opinion contends:

posed to the demand of the carpenters for
an Increase in wages, and also opposed
a similar demand on the part of the mill

Some days ago the Builders' Protective

PEAL ESIATE TRANSACTIONS.
But before any of the litigation had
reached the trial stage Mrs. Cogswell
flied. Her estate and the numerous relaj.
tlves whom she remembered were In
volved in the original contests, because
there was still to come to' her a consid
erable portion of her husband's fortune.
It was in part to prevent interminable
tangles In the two estates that the move
Â¦was inaugurated toward an amicable set
tlement out of court of the contestants*
demands.
"With the conditions as they are torday
1 can only say that matters are quite sat
isfactory," said Attorney George W.
Reed. "I am not at liberty to give any
of the details at present. Those are mat
ters which do not concern any one but
the interested parties. In fact. I would
refuse to say anything at all were I not
aware that it is known by outsiders that
the settlement of the contests is in hand."'
On top of fhese contests came a number
of Euits against the estate. Among these
was cne filed by John Samml, who de
manded $4000 as salary for. services as pri
vate secretary to the doctor.
Shortly before Mrs. Cogswell's | death
one-half of her husband's estate was dis
tributed to her. To that she had' legal
right as wife, no matter what the out
come of the contests.'. That left about
$250,000 of the' husband's estate to be the
object of attack.
Peace Overtures Are Being Made
Following them came Mrs. Emily May
Eatnmi, another niece, who attacked the
codicil, by which a bequest of $15,000
worth of Oceanic Steamship Company's
stock made to her was revoked. Then the
Rev. E. O. Jamison of Boston, Mass., who
was a devisee for $2000 in the will, insti
tuted a contest because the request had
been revoked by the codidL .
The first to attack the will were Mrs.
Marion Stevens of San Francisco and her
brother. Don Alvera Skellinger. an Inmate
of the Soldiers' Home at Yountville. They
were niece and nephew of the old doctor
but were not mentioned in the will., These
contestants charged undue influence and
the mental incapacity of their uncle in
their contest.
Dr. Cogswell made' a flat bequest of
J100.000 to his wife and all of the re
mainder of. his fortune, after $29,000 in
specific bequests had been paid to various
nieces, nephews and other relatives.
But he brought a number of contests
down upon the will because he omitted to
remember some relatives*, and in a codicil
revoked several bequests that were made
in the will when originally executed.
More than usual interest attaches to the
prospect of settlement of the contests be
cause of the-tnany extraordinary circum-
Etances which have surrounded the lives
of the celebrated couple, as well as the
developments since their deaths, the
widow surviving her spouse only, a short
time. t
Several Relatives File Contests.
The executor of the will, William G.
Henshaw. president of the Union Savings
Bank of Oakland, and his attorney.
George W. Reed, refuse to furnish the de
tails of the negotiations for settlement.
They are satisfied -with the progress- of
affairs, however, and are hopeful that the
mass of litigation in which the estates of
the deceased dentist and his wife are in
volved will speedily be disposed of by dis
missals in court.
Four contests of~ the - will of the late
Henry D. Cogswell of San Francisco, iwiw
left an estate valued at $500,000, are in
process of settlement. A number of the
suits against the golden hoard left by the
eged dentist are also likely to be settled.
Negotiations which have been in progress
for some time looking toward the adjust
ment of the various contests and other
litigation have reached a stage that is sat
isfactory. The early dismissal of the sev
eral contests is expected by the attorneys
both for the estate and the contestants.

leges, "will jnake good .people" shudder."
;â¢â¢> Miss Richards began suit to-day against
J.-J.SWMlngham i and Mrs. M. ( Tighe for
$20,000. : She alleges that- in April, 1900, she
was engaged to marry - Willingham, the
wedding being set for the -following Sep
tember, and tnat, relying on the contract,
she went to San Francisco and furnished
a house for housekeeping at an expense
of $500. Then Willingham failed to ap
pear on , the wedding day, and for this,
the complaint recites, Mrs. Tighe was re
sponsible.; Miss Richards says sjhe was in
business as l a dressmaker when he be
came engaged to Willingham, and that
her profits were $8 to $10 a day; there
fore', she estimates her pecuniary loss: at
$5000 and. the remainder of the $2C,000 she
wants because, being "very much In love

Special Dispatch to The CalL ' x
The indications here to-night point
strongly to a strike declaration, as the
operators' letters â¢ seem to have caused
much bitter feeling among the men.
PHILADELPHIA, March 19.â It was
learned to-night from a - trustworthy
source that in refusing to enter a Joint
conference with representatives of the
United Mine Workers, the officials of the
great coal-carrying railroads and coal
companies were careful â¢ to word their
declination in such a way that it waa not
a direct refusal to meet the miners' rep
resentatives because they were such. '
The companies generally answered the
request of the miners by letter, saying it
was impracticable to arrange a wage scale
that would be uniform because of the dif
ferent conditions of mining in the different
fields, and on the ground that nothing
could come of a conference they declined
to .meet the miners as proposed. â¢
"it is needless to say the delegates ex
pressed keen disappointment, and the op
position to continuing work under the
present low wages and unfair conditions
was unanimous and" emphatic." '
President Mitchell addressed the con
vention, and he states that he. advised
caution and prudence in arriving at any
decision as to further action.
"What the final outcome will be is at
this time purely problematical." was the
concluding sentence of the press commit
tee's statement,.
"The letters, while couched in different
language, are all of the same purportâ a
positive refusal to confer with the repre
sentatives of their employes upon the
wages to be paid and the conditions of
employment which should obtain.
"The committee selected by the" Hazle
ton convention last August to go to New
York and see the highest authorities of
the coal companies and arrange for a joint
conference reported the refusal of E. B.
Thomas, chairman of the directors of the
Erie Kailway. . to receive the committee.
The same committee selected by the In
dianapolis convention to invite the oper
ators to cdnfer on 'the question of a wage
scale for the year beginning April 1, 1WJ,
reported the result of interviews with the
railroad president and presented letters
from railroad companies in reply to the
invitations. Â¦
SHAMOKIN, Pa., March 19.â During the
executive session . the American Mine
Workers'; convention, appointed the com
mittee on scale and on resolutions, and
heard the report of the special committee
appointed to seek a* conference with the
operators. After , the adjournment this
afternoon President Mitchell, speaking for
the press. committee, made this statement:
A rumor was current to-day that a
number of cases of cartridges were on
the pier at the time of the nre and that
they were destined for the uae of the
Boers in South Africa. According to the
report the cartridges were to have been
shipped to Antwerp and from there to
their destination. A member of the Ho
boken Fire Department said to-day that
he saw the boxes of cartridges on the
pier and that he heard a number of ex
plcslons. Several officials of the *Pkoi-nix
line to-day denied having any knowledge
of cartridges or any explosives belns on
the dock. The British Consul General
said to-day that he had no information
that any such munitions for the Boers
were on the ship.
Besides Hussey four longshoremen were
taken to St. Mary's Hospital and are now
under treatment there.- All were more
or less burned. Some of the longshore
men, who saved themselves by -rimming
ashore say- they saw twenty or thirty
men leap into the river. Although some
of those who jumped into the water were'
picked up by tugs, it is feared that a
lrumber sank before they could be
reached by the rescuers.
Many of the longshoremen are single
men and have no relatives who could re
port them if missing. . Tho police Bay that
no one except Engineer Scott had teen
reported to them as missing. The Brit
ish Queen has been beached off Commu
nlpaw. In the Upper Bay. Those seriously
hurt in the fire are John Jensen, who
jumped from the burning pier and struck
his head against a beam, and Peter Car
ioll, who was badly burned.
It was learned to-day that Fireman
Thomas Cobney of the flreboat David A.
Boody fell off the boat last night and was
drowned. Patrick Hussey, a longshore
man, who was burned while trying tc es
cape from the pier, died to-day from, the
eftects of his injuries. â¢ .::
Chief Engineer Scott of the steamer
British Queen, who was supposed to liave
Derished in the lire, walked into a Ho
jboken hotel to-day. He was badly
burned about the face ana said he had
had a dreadful experience. Dr. Heifer,
the Health Officer of Hoboken, says that
.â¢ill the men of the British Queen have
been accounted for.
NEW YORK, March 19.â No estimate
could be made to-day of the loss of life
In the fire that started last night on the
Phoenix line pier in Hoboken, and It was
thought tne number of dead never would
be known. ">V ; 'Â¦Â«'Â¦.'.Â¦
Ihe story published in an afternoon
paper regarding an assault on Ho Yow,
the Chinese' Consul General, at the Jack
son-street theater Tuesday . night is en
tirely without foundation. The Consul
was not present at the theater either Sat
urday night or Tuesday night, when the
disturbances were alleged to have taken
place, and is not In the slightest danger
irom attacks or insult from highbinders
at any time. Â¦ Â¦
Notwithstanding the assurances given
by the representatives of the Six Compa
nies to the police that the threatened
highbinder outbreak in Chinatown had
been declared off, the indications are that
trouble is likely to break out at any time.
Two Chinamen were found in a doorway
on Dupont street, between Clay and
Washington, at â¢ an early hour yes
terday morning by Policeman Steve Bun
ner. On the policeman's approach the
skulkers took to their heeis, Â¦ but were
overhauled, and when searched a larga
Colt's revolver was found on one of them.
He gave the name of Get Too at the City
Prison, where he was charged with car
rying concealed weapons..
At the time of the arrest a large num
ber of the \\ ong family was gathered at
a banquet in a Chinese restaurant only a
few doors from where the highbinders
were hiding. A street lamp had been ex
tinguished eo that its ligh; might not bt
tray the assassins' presence, it was evi
denUy the intention to attack some mem
ber of the Wong family as the banqueters
emerged from the restaurant, .and only
the timely arrival and keen eyes of Po
liceman Bunner prevented a tragedy. As
soon as the highbinders were discovered
word was. taken to the restaurant for
those inside not to venture out, and the
feast. was concluded only when daylight
came. .

GRAPE-NUTS.
NEW THEORY ON
Cause of llay Pever.
Hay fever is not eo much a result of
climatic conditions as it Is a showing: of
the "weak spot" In the general condition
of- the body. If a hay fever sufferer can
be fed up to a prime condition of health
by the use of well selected rood the
chances are the hay fever will not pre-
sent itself^
As an illustration, a lady in Cave
Springs, Ga., explains how the change of
food affected her." "This past Bummer I
found myself in a very low. state of
health and much emaciated. I got down
to 95 pounds and was worried, especially
as I had to look forward to my annual
tussle with hay fever in September and
felt it would push me even further down.
One day a friend told me she had been
using Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food and'
that she lelt like a new person with
greatly Increased strength and vigor.' I
grasped at the straw and began the use
of Grape-Nuts. The effect was really
magical. Fa a week I felt toned up and
In a month began in earnest to gain flesh
and strength. By September my weight
had increased to 110 pounds aÂ«d much to
ray amazement I discovered that when
the hay fever sufferers began to complain
I had not one symptom and escaped it al-
together. Inasmuch as I had suffered for
years from this miserable disease' and
had made no change except in my food,'
I naturally concluded that my improved
conditio'n was caused by the daily use of
Grape-Nuts and by observing the usual
tews of health." Name can be given by

Among the passengers was Domingo Vasquea,

Duncan In his own behalf made a gen

prosecution.
The hearing of '.witnesses for the de
fense at the trial of Edward Duncan,
charged with the murder of George W.
Rice, non-union machinist, at Twentieth
and Howard streets October 11, was con
tinued before a jury in. Judge Lawlor's
court yesterday. There will be one more
witness as to character thia morning and
the defense will close.
Mary Rosenholz, a new witness, testi
fied that she saw the shooting of Rice.
The two men were standing up face to
face while one was ehooting the other,
she said. This is opposed to the testimony
of all the other witnesses, who said that
Rice was first knocked down with a club,
and. that while he Â» was lying prostrate on
the ground Buckley fired the shots into
his body. Another new witness was Ed
ward J. Robinson, who at the time of the
murder was a striking machinist. He tes
tified that shortly before 6 o'clock he saw
Duncan come out'of a grocery at the cor
ner of Twentieth and Shotwell streets
and spoke to him. Just then they heard
the shooting and went to see what it was.
In cross-examination he admitted that hf>
had not testified at the three other trials
although he had consulted with Buck
ley's lawyers along with Oppenhelmer, a
witness for the defense at the Buckley
trial. His testimony is opposed to the
statement of Duncan, who said he Went
to the grocery about 4:45 o'clock and came
out. in a few minutes.

Detectives Crockett and Regan, who
Â¦were detailed to work on the case, inter
viewed Gilroy and Gorman, and upon the
men stating that they were not present
at the scene of the tragedy, but were at
a clambake, the detectives allowed them
to go. AH the witnesses yesterday swore
tbat it must have been 'either Ollroy or
Gorman that knocked Eugene McCarthy
under the wheels of the car. The inquest
was accordingly continued in order that
the missing witnesses might be produced.
The inquest in the matter of the death
of Eugene McCarthy, who was run over
by a streetcar last Sunday night In front
of Nolan's saloon, at the Intersection of
JFolsom and Xinth â¢ streets, was left un
finished yesterday because the police had
failed to produce the two men who arÂ«
believed to have been the cause of Mc-
Carthy's death.
It appeared 'from the testimony that
Daniel and Eugene McCarthy got into a
fight in the saloon with several men. John
Cshil! had a fight with Daniel McCartny,
brother of the dead man, and M. Ward
and P. Gallagher became mixed up in it.
Then two strangers named Gllroy and
German, who were In the crowd, chased
Eugene McCarthy out of the saloon, and
cne of them struck him a blow on the
head, knocking him down in front of a
passing car, which ran over him, killing
him instantly.

J. J. Sweeney, saloon-keeper, 141 Second
street, had been missing- things from his
saloon for two or three nights, and after
closing about 1 o'clock yesterday morning
he waited in the darkness for develop
ments. They came in less than two hours'.
He heard a key inserted in the lock of
the side door, on Natoma street, the door
was opened and a man entered. Sweeney
waited for a few minutes while the in
truder helped himself to some of the arti
cles on the shelves and then struck him
on. the head with a club, knocking h!m
down. Sweerrey jumped on top of the
burglar and was struggling with him when
Policeman McQuaide, who was attracted
by the noise, made his appearance. The
intruder was placed under arrest and
booked on the charge of burglary. Two
bottles of whisky and a bottle of porter
were found in his pockets. He gave his
name as William White. He appeared In
Judge Cabaniss' court later and the case
was continued till to-day.
Michael King, saloon-keeper, Steuart and
Mission streets, reported to the '.police
yesterday that his saloon had been en
tered by burglars between 2 and- 6 o'clock
Tuesday morning and that stock and
money to the value of $43 had been stolen.
The- back of a large slot machine had
been forced open and the nickels it con
tained \ had also been stolen. Entrance
had been effected by sawing two strips
off a wooden grating on the basament

The police do not believe that a tragedy
is connected with the desertion of the
buggy. They are inclined to think rather
that the perambulator was abandoned by
some woman, : possibly in her haste to
catch a Sausaiito boat or in the sup
position that; it would be taken charge of.|
by the baggagemen. ( j
A baby buggy left Just outside the
freight gate of -the Sausalito ieyrry Tues
day night may prove to be a clew to an
other murder or suicide mystery. While
there is nothing about, the perambulator
tp indicate a tragedy, the police are puz
zled to find a reason for its abandonment
at such a place. "
The buggy is a cheap affair and old.
Among the articles in it was a dilapidated
book of child's fairy tales, "Echoes from
Fairyland," with the following written
on the fly leaf: "Vera Beatrice Degandis;
from papa, December 30," 1D0O." The name
Degandis does not â¢ appear in recent city
directories. t
A pillow with a of laundry
marks on the case, a piece of checked oil
cloth, a loosely knit child's shawl, several
cheap trinkets, a "bottle, nearly-full, of an
emulsion,- labeled "Ozomulslon." and a
copy of the San Francisco Trade Journal,
were also found with the buggy. A boat
man first saw the abandoned carriage and
turned it over to Patrolman Barnett. He
took it to the Harbor police station, and
it remains there, awaiting a claimant or
identification. i:.
Irving M. Scott is in the East, and John
Xicholl insists that he holds an option for
the Union Iron Works on Point Richmond
property with a frontage on the bay
which fits it for use as a ship building or
ship finishing site. Such a location would
certainly have its advantages, saving the
expense and risk of transshipping the big
guns and armor plate of the" battle ships.
If the entire ship building plant of the
iron works were transferred to Point
Richmond the expense of dredging would
be avoided, as the tide currents keep a
good depth of water there. A saving,
also, would certainly be effected in the
cost of fuel oil. Point Richmond would
be enriched by the establishment of an
auxiliary plant, and San Francisco would
be the loser. The Point Richmond people
believe that a thousand men will be em
ployed there, insuring an increase of some
5000 in the town's population, and that
real estate values may be expected to
boom and general prosperity to increase

Point Richmond is jubilant over a re
port that the Union, Iron "Works .is to
establish an auxiliary plant there, pre
sumably as a finishing plant where armor
plate and gun equipment can be placed
after the launching of war vessels from
the Potrero ship yards. John Nicholl Jr.,
president of the John Nicholl Land Com
pany, a corporation that has control of
large tracts of land at Point Richmond, is
autfcority for the statement that Irving
M. Scott, before his departure for the
Kast, was given an option on the old
Kemillard brick yard . property, and that
the ship builders contemplated buying"
thirty-five acres additional for the site of
a ship finishing plant.
Henry T. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works, denies emphatically that any
such plans are under consideration. He
<-aid last night:
There is no such- move contemplated. Th*
Union Iron Works Is not to be removed to
l'oint Richmond nor is any auxiliary plant to
be established there. We have no optio i
on property there, and bo far as "I know
Irving M. Scott has not Becured an option. If
he lias he has not informed me of the deal
ana he did not act for the Union Iron Works.
I do not know of any project to establish an
iron works or â¢ shipbuilding plant or branch of
-euch a. Dlant at Point Richmond.
It is true that we had a property at Folsom
and Second streets and that we planned to put
& plant there for the manufacture o' mining
machinery, but the strike held on so long that
we cave it up and sold the land. If we decide
later to build such an auxiliary plant it will
be enough then to consider the site. For
the present we are not considering ..hat plan.
We own all the, land of our Potrero site.
Not a foot of it is leased property. In fact,
we own much more out there which we have
not yet taken in for the iron works. â¢ â
We have a contract with -the Standard Oil
Company for,<uel oil.- When their pipe line
and tanks at Point Richmond are ready they
will besin the delivery of oil at our plant
by means of tank barpes. We have no con
tract with the ArsDCiated Oil ComDany. and
the erection of tanks at Point Richmond has
no -relation to any contract for the delivery of
oil to. us.

present thirty-one vessels to transport coal from

rying capacity of 90,000 tons; some of these
vessels will not reach their loading port for
three'or four months. With a vessel Just char
tered to carry grain to Europe at 22s 6d It
would be supposed . that no vessels would seek
this port, unless they secured fancy rates for
coal carrying, whereas the last Australian
quotations for coal freights are less than 10s
per ton, and several vessels offering. The ask
ing prices for colonial grades are lower than
for some time past, and the outlook Is not
encouraging for early improvement, especially
for such coals as are only adapted for steam
uses. A. few cargoes of Wallsend or East Greta
near at hand or fully due would \ bring full
prices, as any character of fuel suitable for
domestic uses is in demand; the yards here are
nearly all without any stocks on hand. The
latest reports from British Columbia state that
the output from the Wellington colliery will
shortly amount to all this market will need
for household purposes. Fuel oil still holds Us
supremacy where steam energy Is. required, and
is dally, gaining new consumers, aa Us price

of consolidation, but both.- of these reacted
sharply. American Ice rebounded 2% from its
recent violent decline. In the railroad list
Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville was
rushed up 4% en distinctly formulated rumors
that it was to be placed on a 4 per cent
dividend basis. Late in the day St. Louis and
San Francisco eprang Into activity and strength
with an advance of nearly 4 points, due to
published reports that the company contem
plated an extension to the Pacific Coast. There
was some .late strength also in Atchison, which
waÂ» practically the only railroad stock of first
importance which moved as much as a point.
The rise of 2% In Sugar was due to the agree
ment reached at Washington on the question
of the Cuban sugar tariff and also to the cer
tificate of condition filed with the Massachu
setts Secretary of State showing large increase
in resources. Meantime there were wide de
clines in stocks which have enioyed recent
periods of istrengrth. the losses being caused by
.the marketing ot only a-few .shares. Among
these were losses of 4 points each in Chicago '
and ' Northwestern preferred and Glucose pre
ferred, a in EvansvUle and Terre Haute and
a point or more in various others. Wells-
Fargo dipped 7U on one transaction and rallied
3% on another. These violent movements
caused bo much confusion and distrust among
spectators that the trading became neglected.
Anxiety also was renewed regarding the im
mediate future of the money market, which
' rhowed a hardening tendency to-day. The
; conference of coal miners at Shamokln was
also an unsettling influence.

NEW YORK, March 19.â It Is not often that
the stock market witnesses such a series of
spectacular and sensational movements as It
was treated to to-day, and in rather a dull
market at that. In Â¦ fact, the ' dullness in the
general list was extreme and prices of \ the
Important railroad stocks moved only with the
utmost reluctance. The usual favorites among
the industrials had a larger share in the trad
ing, both Amalgamated Copper and Sugar oc
cupying- fairly prominent places. But it was
among the stocks 'which are traded in only at
intervals of weeks as a rule that the specu
lations were fiercest and the price movements
violent. There was nothing in the way of
news to explain why buying orders for 6500
shares of Colorado Fuel should . make a .wide
opening In that stock all the way from par
to 107, - compared with 98 last night. Neither
the high point of this range nor the low point
was touched again during the day, but the
dealings continued very heavy and the fluctua
tions leverieh. Activity was revived in New
York Airbrake, with a jump of 10% In price
end a subsequent relapse of fully half that.
North American suffered from realizing after
the opening advance, but forged upward again
to 6% above last night and fluctuated wildly.
The rise of 5% In General Electslc and of 3
in WestlnKhouse Electric were due to rumors

â¢'Still another cause of uneasiness is the
labor situation and the prospects of renewed
disturbances this epnng. These three uncer
tainties â the monetary situation, the Northern
Securities deal and labor agitation â are all
adverse to any Improvement In the stock mar
ket Just now; and to them must shortly be
added a fourth, Â¦ the crop outlook. When the
outlook in these respects improves and pricec
settle down tn more tempting figures, we may
expect a substantial upward movement. The
(reneral situation is sound and business in
many lines continues active, even if less profit
able than a year ago. Railroad earnings are
well sustained, except In regions suffering from
rhort com and cotton crops; and considering
the great activity of the last three years tha
continued pressure of freight both East and
West Is marvelous."
"A number of influences are adverse to the
market just now. Hank reserves are almost
down to the vanishing point, and there is Ut
tie rxpspect of any relief to.the,monetary,sit
uation, except by contraction of loans, until
the middle of April. If any forced contraction
should occur, we may expect further declines;
and In any Â«vent no genuine bull movement U
possible until money becomes more abundant
and easier. Very large* sums are locked up
in syndicate operations; some estimates be
ing in the neighborhood of $200,000,000 In the
New York banks alone; to say nothing of bor
rowings elsewhere. As mercantile and specu
lative demands are not extraordinary, it is
evident that the present stringency in the
money market is mainly due to the operations
of these big, strong borrower* ; and this ex
plains the comparative Indifference cf bank
ers to the phenomenal expansion in loans. If
this expansion were due to outside speculation
a very different feeling would exist In bank
ing circles than is now current; for In spite
of temporary drawbacks there are no appre
hensions regarding the future.
"Occasional epurts, but quietness and a
reneral sagging tendency, have been the feat
urea of the stock market for 6everal weeks,
and the drift still appears to be in the same
direction. Many of the big financiers are ab
sent, as usual at this period of the year;
hence Important negotiations are frequently
postponed, and market movements lack the
stimulus which such men and euch develop
ments afford. Apparently their arrangements
contemplate a firm resistance to any bear at
tacks or decided breaks, but little opposition.
If any. to gradual and moderate "recessions.
IX this Eurmiee is true, their policy Is evidently
a sound one. Values have long: been 'pegged'
at Â«uch an extremely high notch that the out-
Side public refused to enter the market; anu
safety, as well as profit and reason, demanded
some reaction from the 'boom' prices of 190L
The better classes of railroad Etocks have
been bo completely withdrawn from the market
by institutional and syndicate buying that in
vestors founds difficult)* in securing suitable
returns upon their money; while speculative
ventures in securities were not only unprofit
able but positively dangerous so long as pow
erful cliques were carrying big masses of se
curities which they could not sell except .at
a loss. Were it not for the united front of
these big holders we should have seen a pretty
bctive bear . campaign during the last six
months, if not before. Entrenched as they
have been, however, controlling many of the
banks, and having at command vast amounts
cf capital both at home and abroad, no â¢ bear
leaders could be found with sufficient cour
age and strength to match such a combination.
Vet our ablest financiers with all their Ekill
and unbounded resources for manipulation
have not been able to tempt the outside pub
lic to relieve them of their burden; and now
they are apparently realizing that, if they ex
pect eucess, they must give the public some
chanc* of admitting them into general part
nership on more favorable terms. -A number
of stocks / have \;-itnessed considerable declines
from top figures, but the reaction should be
carried further if outside buying is to be ex
pected with any freedom.

ELECTION OFFICEBS -
TO APPEAK IN - COURT
The attorneys for Dow and Mrs. Hines
are Henry M. Owens and W. H. Bodflsh.
It was learned, says Attorney Hoeffler,
that one of these attorneys visited the
County Clerk's office and got the certified
copy of the records: The copying was
done by Martin Flemming. while the rec
ords were read from the books by the at
torney.
When the bundle of papers connected
with the case was opened several impor
tant documents were found to be missing.
They are the petition for final distribu
tion, the proof of posting application and
the proof of posting of final account.
Probate . Clerk , Edward Casey threw a
little light on the affair when questioned
by Hoeffler. Casey said he had issued a
certified copy of the records on March 12.
but could not say to whom. This docu
ment, which was made - after the dates
had been changed, was filed by H. Dow,
a brother of Mrs. .Waters, with the Re
corder.
. Sherrard's entries showed, that the pe
tition for a decree of distribution had not
been filed until December 9, one day after
the filing of the final account. . Hoeffler at
once petitioned for a new decree of distri
bution, claiming that' the one issued in
1S94 was void, because the petition for dis
tribution had not been filed with the an
nual account.
Clerk's Entries Expose Fraud.
The . attorney wrote to Judge Coffey,
telling him- of his discoveries and yester
day a .further search was made. The
books used by J. B. Sherrard, clerk to
Judge Coffey in 1893-94 were brought out
an'd the alterations were at once apparent.
Hoeffler let the matter rest until last
Monday, when he â¢ again went over the
books. Much to his surprise he found the
entry of December 8 had been "changed to
December 9, after his previous visit, and
in a. very clumsy manner.
On the afternoon of February 7 of this
year Hoeffler went to the County Clerk's
office and examined the records. He found
that the final account of the administra
tors of the Arthur Waters estate and the
petition for distribution had been filed
December 8, 1893.. His researches In the
minute books, however, showed a start
ling state of affairs. According to these
books the petition for distribution had not
been filed until the day after the filing of
the final account. This is contrary to
law. which provides that the papers shall
be filed . tosether. *
vestigate. In the course of his investiga
tions he Jearned enough ' to cause him to
communicate with the Vermont heirs.
vÂ»Who;altered the records of . the probate
proceedings in the estate of Arthur
Waters? .Is the question that is now agi
tating I the v minds of County Clerk Ma
hony. Judge - Coffey: and Louis Hoeffler,
attorney, for a nephew and niece of the de
ceased liveryman. The question was asked
time 'and again yesterday, by "the inter
ested parties, but it is still unanswered.
Â¦The alterations, -for- there Is no doubt
that the records have been tampered with,
were so bunglingly executed that they are
easily discerned. So noticeable are they,
in fact, that. they show" that Â¦ whoever
changed the dates and figures in question
knew little of the law. Entries in record
books in the County Clerk's office have
been changed in such a crude manner that
even persons not- versed in such . records
can- detect the. alterations, but the dates
and figures in the original. document have
not been altered to conform. . Â¦ ' v
Though the^ alterations themselves are
not of Importance, the investigation which
followed their discovery developed a state
of affairs which means a great deal for a
number of people.- The Interested parties
are a. sister, a niece and a nephew of
Waters, and a brother and -sister of the
widow, lately deceased. .
Waters Left -Large '.'Estate.
About ten years ago Arthur Waters, a
liveryman, died intestate in' this city, leav
ing an estate estimated . to - be worth
$100,000. The widow asked the court to ap
point Charles C. Pennell and-J. T. Grant
administrators of the estate. They were
appointed, and when the probate proceed
ings were heard by Judge Coffey the
widow : swore - that her- husband -had no
relatives living, and', therefore she was
the sole heir. i
The property_-was ordered distributed to
herxm Januarys, 1S94, and the estate was
settled forthwith: . . ' < - ;
A short; time .after the -decree of distri
bution had been made by Judge Coffey,
John J. Enrightv a lawyer of Vermont, ap
peared in this city and announced himself
as Â¦ the legal representative of Margaret
Mulcahey. a-stster of Waters, and Cath
erine A. Wood and John 1 Wood, .niece and
nephew of . the deceased liveryman. En
right's clients were entitled' to one-fourth
of the estate and he brought suit to have
that much of , the property declared a
trust for their benefit, alleging fraud as a
basis. for his suit. Â¦â¢ .'. Â¦' <\ r
.The case was tried before Judge Troutt,
who. holding that the distribution ordered
by Judge Coffey was final, granted a mo
tion for a non-suit made by the defend
ants. The case was appealed, and Troutt's
decision was sustained.
Mrs. Waters Dies.
Mrs. Waters died a short time after this
decision was rendered,, leaving the estate
to Hezekiah Dow and Mrs. Hines her
brother and sister. A short time ago the
legatees of. Mrs. Waters advertised a por
tion of the estate for sale. The property
offered; is located at" . Polk and Gearv
streets, and Attorney Hoeffler Wd $50,000
Imw Â¦ I ?Is-bid_- was rejected, because
a higher one had been received. This.re'
jectlon caused discoveries of the changes
in the records. ' : Â¦ . Â¦
Hpeffler learned that, the title to the prop
erty had been "held up" by a title insur
ance company, and he determined to in-

cap?" asked the first officer., >
''He says he's ah engineer,", replied the
quartermaster. â¢ . . ,
"Call the chief ' engineer to line â¢ up his
men," Was the order. . â¢ ' ' â¢ . Â¦ :
.The chief engineer mustered his force
and Morgan Smith was not in the ranks.
"Isn't that fellow an assistant engi
neer?" asked the -first officer... - ; .. ' . .
"I haven't a red-headed engineer on my
list," was the chiefs reply. . â¢-
That was the finish. of J. Morgan. Â¦'Â¦.
When the transport steamed â¢ out. into
the stream Smith thought he was safe.
Hut .alas for his plans the belated pas
sengers in quarantine at Angel Island
had to be taken aboard, and during that
delay suspicion grew .that .the.' stranger
was not really an engineer, although he
had~said he ( was with the air 'that has

At any rate lie conceived the idea of go

Â¦ Interested' spectators of the combat in
the Republican ranks note that the bosses
are staggering from the force of a few
preliminary cuffs' from the independent
press. What will; happen to the machine
when the real hammering begins in- the
country can be conjectured. Gage, how
ever, is . receiving some newspaper sup
port. , The Acton Rooster and tne Evening
Post are "doing noble."
Prominent Public Men Visiting Hero.;
Ex-Senator E. C. Voorhies of Sutterj
Creek is among, the public men of the
State 'in the city. â¢ He represented the
counties of Alpine, Amador, Calaveras
and Mono in the State Senate during the
Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-lirst and
Thirty-second sessions of the Legislature.
His masterly grasp of affairs as chairman
of the. Senate Finance Committee really
brought about the era of low taxes in this
State.' His successor in the Senate, John
F. Davis of Jackson, is in town. Davis is
Â¦ lawyer,' statesman and author. He con
tributed tothe "History of the Bench and
Bar of California" a t "Historical Sketch
of IMlning. Law in California." -Recently
he obtained permission of the publishers
to reprint the sketch. The reproduction
covers : eighty-three pages and deals with
topics of -great .interest to miners. Judge
Davis" is Justly regarded throughout the
State as one of the. ablest legislators and
one of the best debaters that ever occu
pied a chair in the Senate. Assemblyman
Dunlap of San'Joaquin, who stood shoul
der: to shoulder. with Davis in supporting
Irving M: Scott for United States Senator,
was in San Francisco yesterday. There is
a deal of gossip to the etfect that Scott
may prolong his Senatorial aspirations,
hence the presence of Davis and Dunlap
may be accounted for on political grounds.
If'the desertions continue it will not be
long before the administration team will
consist only of - burns, Herrin and Gage.
It is true that John Lynch and Johnny
Mackenzie* are counted on to do some
hara pulling for Gage, but they are likely
to baU when they nnd tne Uai to> heavy.
MoseTGunst is relied on to lend a puil,
out he has. a sharp nose for a loser and
can readily change his base by getting

he was recently, recruited.

to defeat the boss bill to place all, the, pa
tronageI-?'of the San Francisco Harbor
Cpmmis'slon into the hands of the "organ

of - the Legislature something has hap
pened to diminish* the Senator's confidence
In the executive. Â¦ The, Indications are that
the Yuba; and. Sutter ; delegations, to .the
next Republican State' Convention .will", be
firmly aligned against the renominatlon
of _ Gage. : It is remarke'd also that Judge
E./C/'Hart â¢ of Â¦ Sacramento," the prede
cessor fof Cutter/in the; position of secre
