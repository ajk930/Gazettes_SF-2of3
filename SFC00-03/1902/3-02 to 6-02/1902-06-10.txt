yesterday in quest of bunko men, so that
the visiting Shriners would not be tempt
ed.by the glitter of gold bricks or the pos
session of high hands drawn from â¢ cold
decks of cards. As a result of the sleuths'
search, seven of the fraternity spent the
night at the Central station and will re
main there until the visitors have depart
ed and the town settles back into ordi

charged with any crime, but will be de

Large crowds of Shriners and their
friends viewed the sights in Chinatown
last night. Every available guide was
â¢pressed into service and many were
obliged to find their way about without di
rection' from any one acquainted with the
territory. . During the night It is esti
mated that at least 5000 strangers found
interest in the doings of Little China and
satisfied their curiosity as to things much
written about concerning the colony of
heathens. The Josshouses were thronged
and the "dope" fiends, who smoke for the
amusement of visitors, carried away their
dimes and nickels in sacks. The restau
rants were well patronized, and chop suey
and other Chinese delicacies were, much
in demand. A Chinese festival in progress
was the occasion for brilliant decorations
and much racket, all of which were heart
ily enjoyed.'

DRUM AND FIFE CORPS.
The El Jebel Temple, from Denver, had
a fine drum and fife corps of sixty-five.
They presented a fine appearance march-
Ing up Market street, all arrayed in their
the ferry or railroad depot they
were hospitably welcomed by the mem
bers "of the - reception committee who
awaited them. The last party to arrive
was Moolah Temple, from St. Louis, that
special coming in at 5:30 p. m. *v
Each delegation was met at the ferry by
the local reception committee and the Is
lam Arab patrol, forty-one in number, all
In smart uniforms and carrying their so
ciety emblem, the star and crescent. The
boys wore cardinal blouses and leggings,
gray trousers, purple coats, yellow sash,
white necktie and the Shriner cap. A band
accompanied the patrol. The various tem
ples were escorted by the patrol to the
quarters assigned to them.
THE last of the Shriner caravans
reached the city yesterday aft
ernoon. At all hours during tho
day the Incoming temples ar
rived, and as soon as the pil
grims presented themselves at
THE Shriners* parade tbjs
evening promises to furnish a
scene of picturesque beauty such
as has not been witnessed in
this city since the memorable
procession of the Native Sons
* during the semi-centennial cel
ebration. Grand Marshal Reuben P.
Hurlbut has estimated that there will be
from eight to ten thousand Shriners in
line. The number, however, will be the
least important' factor, as the parade
throughout Its length will be a gorgeous
spectacle. The marching caravans, with
each individual arrayed in Arabic cos
tume, will impart to the procession the
flavor of an oriental pageant.
The course of the parade along Market
street will be beneath a veritable flood of
radiance. The thousands of Incandescent
lights which have been strung at regular
intervals across the street will all be .
sparkling, and many of the public build
ings will be brilllanty iluminated to light
the marching hosts on their way.
The parade will be divided into
thirteen divisions and each will be
hetaded by a band. Drum corps
and bands will also be Interspersed
through all the divisions so that
there will be music enough for alL The
parade will form at 7 o'clock sharp
and the start will be made at 8*
o'clock. The grand marshal promises that
there will be no delay in getting off
prompOy on time. The line of march will
be from Market and Ninth streets down
Market to Montgomery, countermarching
to Ninth street. It is expected that the
parade will be doubled along its entire
length and that when the head reaches
Ninth street on the countermarch the rear
division will just be commencing to move.
On reaching Ninth street those mounted
will dismount and those in carriages will
alight and the entire parade will pro
ceed to Mechanics' Pavilion, where it will
be reviewed by Imperial Potentate Philip
G. Shaffer.
FEATURES OF THE PARADE.
One of the special features and in all
probability the one which will excite the
most interest will be the maneuvers of
the Arab patrols. There will be six pa
trols In ail and each rider will be dressed
tn Arabic costume. Thirty Shriners
mounted on white horses magnificently
caparisoned will comprise the patrol of
the local temple. Islam Temple enter
tains a feeling of great pride for this pa
trol, and well it may, as $1200 has been ex
pended in properly equipping horses and
riders. It was this patrol that under the
leadership of Reuben P. Hurlbut, the
grand marshal of the present parade, won
the prize at Louisville.
All along the line of march the patrols
will execute maneuvers. The horses will
not be allowed for a moment to walk, but
will be kept continually running, wheel
ing and prancing. Each patrol will be al
lowed to eo through Its maneuvers but
the movements will not be allowed to de
lay the parade. The horses have been
Ehod with rubber shoes, so as not to slip
on the asphaltum.
There will be floats representing scenes
In various countries. There will be four
wagon trains, each drawn by eight voke
of oxen. The trains will be under* the
supervision of H. F. Burns and will be
filled with pioneers. These wagons drawn
by the sturdy oxen are intended to be
emblematic of the trains that were used
by the pioneers In crossing the great
prairie in the early days of California,
and they may also be considered as em
blematic of the caravans drawn by the
faithful camels and used by the Arabs of
the desert. Several of the temples will
Lave camels in line, and Al Kader of Or
egon will be there with a whole drove of
the stately beasts.
THE MORNING PARADE.
There will also b* a parade In the morn
ing, but this event is not intended so
much for the eyes of spectators as It 1*
to furnish a proper escort for the Im
perial Council at .Golden Gate Hall. Reu
ben P. Hurlbut will act as grand marshal,
end he will be assisted by the same aids
ee will serve at the grand parade in the
evening.
The morning parade will form on New
Montgomery street, with its right resting
en Market eJtreet. It will commence to
move at 9 o'clock. The line of march will
fce up Montgomery street to California, to
Kearny to Market, to Stockton to Post,
to Powell to Sutter and thence to Golden
GatÂ© H*1L
The parade will be> composed of 1000
men, 100 of whom will be mounted and
attired in white. Appropriate music will
be furnished, and, although the parade is
not really intended as a display for the
public, nevertheless it will prove a very
pretty epectade.
For the parade in the evening the grand
marshal has issued the following direc
tions:
Formation from Tenth to Ninth street,
column of threes; at Ninth street, column of
sixes, open order. Thie formation to be main
tained until arrival at Ninth street on counter
march. Form column of threes and enter Pa

The deposition was prepared by Dan Kevane, former "outside law partner" of Governor Gage in Los Angeles. A prison vehicle was sent to San Rafael and the stenographer of the prison, C. M. Reynolds,

were sent for. They were required to sign the deposition and swear to the truth of the document. Without hesitation Foley,. Gilardin and Pretzel affixed their signatures to the deposition, and Reynolds, the prison stenog
rapher and Notary Public, certified to their acts. Foley, Gilardin and Pretzel are employes of Warden Aguirre and they surmised the fate in store for them if they did not do as required by Dan Kevane, the man Friday of
Governor Gage. A

Governor Gage and the Board
of Prison Directors cannot plead
that- they were ignorant of the
rules and regulations ; governing
the parole of convicts. The rules
and regulations , were formulated
by the Board of Directors acting
under the authority of an act of
the Legislature, and Governor
'Gage has often had occasion to
consult those rules. Governor
Gage simply asked the Board of
Prison Directors to parole Mah
Noon, and the request was grant
ed. In no instance did the Gov
ernor or the, Directors comply
with the rules and regulations of
the parole law. Rule 2 of the pa
role regulations provides as fol
lows :
LAW THAT WAS VIOLATED.
Governor Gage asked for the
parole of Mah Noon on the
ground that he (the Governor)
believed that the convict was
"probably innocent," and that, if
the desperado 'was set at liberty,
he would be given a position in
the Governor's household in Los
Angeles County. The statements
of the police officers of this city
who engaged in battle with Mah
Noon show that the Chinese is
the most villainous of highbinders
and other officers declare that to
parole such a wretch is a disgrace
to the community.
In securing the parole of Mah
Noon, the bloodthirsty high
binder, convict and all-round
criminal, Governor Gage and
the Board of Prison Â¦ Directors
have flagrantly violated the laws
of the State of California. In or
der that Governor Gage might
enjoy the services of the convict
as a cook the parole law has been
set at naught. The chief execu
tive has treated with contempt
the act of the Legislature that
provides for the parole of con
victs, and in an unblushing man
ner has broken his* oath of office.
Govepnon Gage, who has pro
claimed himself the friend of the
workingman, went to San Quen
tin prison in order. to find a chef
fit to prepare the dishes. for h's

Â¦ George E. White's was a remarkable
career. He was born in Lewis County,
Virginia, on August 17, 1832, and was re
lated through his mother to the celebrated
Jackson family. General Stonewall Jack
son having been his cousin. In April, 1843,
he started with some relatives across the
plains to California, traveling with ox
teams and arriving at Lawson's ranch on
Deer Creek in September. For a -time he
followed mining in Shasta County, but,
growing ill, he returned to the Sacra
mento Valley. After trying various occu
pations in different- places he finally, in
May, 1S54, crossed the mountains from
Stony Creek, in company with five others,
bent upon prospecting tor gold, and
chanced to enter Round Valley. He found
that a party headed by one Kelsey had
been there- before him, but had gone.
.-White located a ranch of about 1000
acres and in 1857 went to reside there per
manently. The first house in Round Val
ley was a cabin on his land.- Continuing
to acquire land he finally became owner
of 35,000 acres in Mendoclno County and
30,000 acres in Trinity County, with. 30,000
sheep and thousands of cattle.
-In 1867 White returned to Virginia, and
in May, .1863, married Miss Alice Fettey.
He brought his wife to Round Valley,
where, in 1873, she died of consumption.
In 1878 he erected on his broad domain
the most palatial residence at that time
north of San Francisco. Later he mar
ried Miss Frankie White; the beautiful
sister of Clarence White, the man who
afterward killed Wylackie John: The cat

happily long, and a sensational divorce
suit followed, in which Mrs. White was

rule reads as follows: ;.â¢/Â¦
Why did not Governor Gage
advertise for his convict cook and
protege the application tjor pa

of funds that Governor Gage
failed to notify the people and
officials of this city and county
that he desired the parole of Mah
Noon. The application for Mah
Noon's parole was not advertised
for the good reason that Gov
ernor Gage desired no publicity
in the matter.;" Had the applica

tised a wave of indignation would
have swept over the community,
and the police and other officials
would' have made .strenuous .ob
jection to Mah Noon, the bloody
king, of the highbinders, being al
lowed outside the prison walls. ,
FURTHER VIOLATION OF LAW.
Rule 4 of the parole.regula

of his intention for two weeks in

the friendly relations between President
Roosevelt and Senator Ranna by going
to l.he White House and frankly telllns
the President it was high time to investi

This in addition to. the representations al
ready made to the President by Repre

mer.t officials in Cleveland, has increaseu
the inteiest in what now promises .to be
come an exciting episode m national Re
publican politics, senator Foraker's at
titude in the matter is not surprising, as
he is now underneath in the political skir
mish in the BucKeye State. President
Roosevelt listened with considerable sur
prise to Foraker's plain statements but
promised nothing in the way of an in
vestigation.
Another incident of the day was the
conference between Senator Hanna and
Civil Service Commissioner James R. Gar
field. GarKeld is expected to go to Cleve
land this week and may carry instruc
tions to make an inquiry into political af
fairs there. Senator Foraker takes the
ground that Collector Leach, Marshal
Chandler, Deputy Marshal Hopkins and
Postmaster Dewstoe; have been guilty of
a violation of the civil service regula
tions and especially of a recent order of
the President. In this he takes direct Is
sue with Senator Hanna and thus the
President again tiecomes involved in the
Hanna-Foraker factional light. One out
coma of the affair may be the candidacy
of Burton for the senatorship against Sen
ator Hanna with the support of the For
aker faction. If an investigation, which
seems to be inevitable, is ordered and re
sults in tho censure or removal of the
Cleveland officials it will result in a
breach between the President and. Senator
Hanna. which all the machine politicians
in Washington admit will be disastrous to
the party. If President Roosevelt con
sider the charges against these men are
of a serious character, he will be com
pelled to act or be charged with shielding
officials simply because they are follow

Wright is stopping. President Mitchell
went to the commissioner's room where
he remained in conference with Wright
for two hours. When he lett Mitchell
said :
" "I have little to say, further than that
I have talked with Wright and have ex
plained to him the situation from the
miners' standpoint and have told him of
the causes which led up to the strike."
"Was there any suggestion of a settle
ment made during the ' interview?'
Mitchell was asked.
"No. I understand Commissioner
Wright was^simply seeking information
for an official report under 'the law."
"Did Commissioner Wright explain to
you President Roosevelt's views concern
ing the trouble?"
"He did not." ; V^V ''
President Mitchell said he would leave
for. Wilkesbarre late to-night or in the
morning. ; . â¢ . ,',
Wright said that for him to tell
whom he expected to see or what he in
tended to do might seriously, interfere
with his investigation. He said that
sections 7 and 8 of the law . under
which the labor bureau is operated
charged the commissioner to investigate
and renort on all labor disputes.
"Of course," said Wright, "I cannot
interfere or act as arbitrator. Although
possessing no power under existing con
ditions, as a patriotic citizen President
Roosevelt is interested in settling . the
struggle. He cannot Interfere, but can
cdvise and suggest, and the efficial inves
tigation may reveal chinks in the situa
tion which have not as yet been touched
upon in the general report and upon
which he may be able to act. He wants

Rheumatism is caused by an acid, sour *%> Â¦

were deposited there by the blood and can be reached only through the blood.
Rubbing with liniments sometimes relieve temporarily the aches. and
pains, but these are only symptoms which are liable to return with every
change of the weather ; the real disease lies deeper, the blood and sj$tem

witnesses needed to rc-try Mrs. Coidelia
Botkin. accused of the murder of Mrs
John P. Dunning of Dover by means of
poisoned candy, except a reasonable per
diem and actual expenses. This, it is
contended, the witnesses are unwilling to
accept for the enforced stay of seven
weeks or more from their-homes and the
perils of a transcontinental trip, and un
less an agreement can be reached it is
feared Mrs. Botkin may go free

the trial Judge for the people of Cali

be some limit to the expense of getting
witnesses. He was referring to the state
ment that the Delaware witnesses par
ticularly the professional men and busi
ness men, proposed to be well paid be
fore they . should again turn over their
business affairs to others. The physi
cians particularly say that they cannot
go under any other considerations, and
do not desire to go at all, leaving their
practice and particular patients to the
care of .others. Delawareans who have
lately been in San- Francisco declare that
the feeling. is still high against Mrs. Bot
kin and that any jury would convict her
of the murder, were they confronted with
the same strong' case that was made
against her before.

JUMPED FROM WINDOWS.
The fire originated In the basement of
the building and spread rapidly to the
upper stories through the elevator shaft
Before the occupants of the building could
be warned the flames had been carried
to the roof, had eaten through it and
were leaping high in the air.
As the cry of fire rang through the
building patients sprang from their beds,
and before they could be prevented sev
ei-al had jumped from the windows to the
pavement. The fire department was on
the scene within a few minutes, and as
the windows were filled with people
shrieking for help the firemen devoted
their tirst efforts to save the lives andvkl
lowed the fire to burn. While this was
the means of saving a large number of
-people who were carried down ladders by
the firemen it gave the fire such headway
that there was almost no chance for those
on the upper floors of the building to
make their escape, and 6uch of them as
were not suffocated were killed or badly
Injured by -leaping from the windows.
KENT'S AWFUI* DEATH.
Alderman Kent, one of the dead, was in
a room on the fifth floor with his atten
dant, A. W. Wattells. The Alderman, who
has been totally blind for many years,
was in a straitiacket and his hands
were manacled to a belt that passed
around his waist. When the alarm of flre
was sounded Wattells ran to investigate.
He found the elevator shaft a mass of
flames and ran back to help the Alder
man, who was blind and unable to do
anything with his hands, and who was
almost mad with fear and was shouting
like an Insane person. He had groped h!s
way to the door and by the time his at
tendant had reached him had fallen to
the floor overcome with smoke. Wattells
seized him and tried to drag him down the
hall to a place of safety, but Kent had
become so crazed that It was almost im
possible to do anything- with him. Wat
tells was finally compelled to run for his
life, as the flames were scorching his
clothing. He ran to a window on the
6outh side of the building, across which
were iron bars. Wattells managed to tear
two or three of these from their fasten
ings, and, with two other men who haÂ«l
followed him, climbed out on the sill.
They were seen by the firemen,
woo called to them to remain
vhtre they were and they would
MTe them. A ladder was run up
and the two men who were with Wattells
were taken down. He became crazed with
excitement and not waiting for the return
of the firemen sprang for a net which
some men were holding on the Bid walk be
neath. He fell partly ln it and partly on
the sidewalk and sustained injuries which
probably will cause his death.
Kent was left lying on the floor of his
room and evidently died of suffocation.
His body was badly burned after death.
Three hours after the outbreak of the
flre the body was found on the floor of his
room, one leg burned to a crisp and the
head burned off. He was Identified by
means of his clothing.
DESFEBATE FIGHT FOB XiIFE.
A - scene that -wrought to the pitch of
madness the great crowd that had gath
ered around the building was enacted at
a fourth story window on the north side.
Across this window was a heavy wire
screen and on the outside of the screen
were iron bars running parallel to the
Bill. The space between these bars was
too email to allow the passage of even a
Â¦mall boy and behind them were gathered
a crowd of men whose numbers were
found to be between twenty-five and thir
ty. Escape ln other directions was im
possible, for the fire filled all the halls
and was steadily eating Its way toward
the window at which the men were stand-
Ing. The one chance for life â¢ for that
crowd of men lay through that screened
and barred window. The men closest to
the screen tore and tugged at it in a vain
effort to tear It from, its fastenings and
the men behind them fought madly to
g^et close enough to the screen to fasten
tnelr fingers on It So fiercely did the
prisoners pull at the screen that from the
street below were plainlv visible tiny
streams of blood that trickled from la
cerated fingers and flowed over the win
do wBill. A number of men at the window
were in straitjackets and manacles;
and these, not being able to help them
selves or others, were the wildest of all
in their frantic efforts to break through
the bars.
The crowd ln the street watching the
desperate situation from behind the scene
was simply an insane mob. They shouted
all ports of commands and directions at
the men and gave orders to the firemen
whcr'wre doing all that men could do
to g** through the bars from the outside.
As file flames came steadily toward the
merr'Jthfe. people in the street jumped up
and-4Â«rwi-Â«nd screamed in helpless rage

of Chicago. No ladders were in front of
the -window, and Anderson's one hopÂ« -was
to reach the platform of a flre escape In
front of the window just west of where
he was. He hesitated for an instant and
then sprang for the flre escape, and
clutching it, was safe. The next man
through the window was G. S. Gott-of
La verge. 111. Anderson was so much ex
hausted that" he was not able to drag
Gott after him and Gott was so badly
burned that he was not able to make the
leap himself. He crouched on the window
sill while the men on the inside clamored
for him to jump. Clinton Osborne, a real
estate dealer of New York City, was the
third man. He crawled out beside Gott
and told the men inside to grasp his feet.
This they did. Telling Gott to take hold
of wrists and drop over the wlndowsill
Osborne, hanging head downward, swung
Gott to and fro until he had acquired suf

j PORTLAND. Ore., June 9.â Harry
Tracy -'/was arrested in Portland on the
evening- of February 6, 1899, after an ex
citing fight with Detective David Wiener.
Tracy, who was wanted for burglary,
was walking along the- "street when De
tective Weiner met him. The two walked
together and when they reached the cor
ner of Fourth and Market streets, Tracy,
seeing the southbound Northern Pacific
train pulling up Fourth street, said: â¢
"I guess I'll take this train. So long." ;
"I guess you won't," said the detective,
â¢ drawing his revolver. â¢ .... : Â¦ '
Tracy fired two shots at the detective,
who returned the fire. Tracy jumped into
the engine and pointed his revolver at the
head of the engineer, who speedily held
up his hands. Tracy ordered- him to go
ahead at full speed, but the conductor
stopped the train. ; Seeing- that his plan
had been frustrated, Tracy jumped from
the engine and started to run. The neigh
borhood had been thoroughly aroused and
after a half-dozen shots had been fired
at the fugitive, one -of which took effect
behind his ear, he- was lodged in jail.
A month afterward, while being taken
from jail to -the court room,. Tracy sud
denly drew a revolver and exchanged
several shots with the jailer, but was
finally overpowered.

The private dispatch from

It is believed that this defeat means an

again and after a few desperate pulls they
managed to tear down a portion, of the
screen. Nerved to the work by their suc
cess, the bodies of the men swayed back
and forth as they put all of their
strength into one last effort Finally the
screen came down, but the bars remained
and they were heavy, placed there for
the purpose of withstanding all the efforts
of Insane men. As many as could Place
their hands on the lower bar .took hold.
It bent almost double and six men went
to the floor with a crash, holding on to
the iron bar which they had torn from
its fastenings.' . So quickly did the men
behind them spring to grasp the 3econd
bar that those who had torn down the
first were badly trampled on before they
could rise. Another bar was soon torn
away, and the path to safety was opened.
While Tracy and Merrill were shooting
at the guards on the fence the" Warden
summoned every available 'man around
the Institution to his assistance In order
to prevent the escape of any of the other
convicts. The penitentiary is only two
miles from town and the news soon
spread. Sheriff Durbln, with a number of
Duncan Ross, a new guard, was on the
fence near Tiffany's station, but being
unarmed he was powerless to assist his
ccmTade who was Deing carried off by
the convicts. The fleeing men fired one
shot at Ross, Inflicting a slight scalp
wound. S
Â¦ Finally, when they escaped out of range
of the prison, they shot Tiffany to death
and took his rifle, which they soon threw
away, however, as it was empty. They
then disappeared in the woods.
Guard Tiffany commenced firing at the
men and soon ' emptied his Winchester
without hitting either of them. He, too,
was a good mark for the fugitives, and
they' sent a bullet through his right
breast. The guard fell from the wall and
the prisoners carried him in front of them
as a shield.
MUBDEB, WOUNDED MAN.
Once outside Tracy and Merrill turned
their attention to the fence . guards * ami
S. R. Jones, located on the northeast cor
rer of the stockade, was the first to re
ceive a bullet from the escaping prisoners.
Jones was on. the wall, in full view, while
the escaping prisoners hugged the fence
and : prevented the guards getting a bead
on them. Jones was shot once in the
abdomen and once in the breast, dying
almost instantly.
Tracy at once turned upon Girard and
began shooting. At the same time Mer
rill began shooting at John Stapleton and
the other shop guards, all of whom es
caped. Ingram, a life prisoner, attempted
to disarm Tracy, but he was shot and
mortally wounded by Merrill. . â
The shooting in the foundry was done
so quickly that it was impossible to sum
mon aid, and the two prisoners at once
started for the prison wall, which they
scaled by means of a ladder.
CONVICT AIDS GUARDS.
At 7 o'clock the foundry gang of prison
ers was marched to its work in the usual
mai.ner. Frank Girard, a guard, counted
the convicts into the shops and announced
the number to be 159 to Frank Ferrell,
guard, at the first post in the shops. Just
as Girard announced the number and re
ceived Ferrell's "all .right" he heard a
rifle shot and the exclamation, "My God!"
from' Ferrell, who fell forward. The shot
was fired from a rifle in the hands of
Tracy.

There ought, to-be "some way for statesmen to set
tle aaebjate of this kind that has been prolonged for
years. The Spooner bill offers a way. It may not be
the best bill that is conceivable, but it is a great deal
better than endless wrangling. It provides a means
of getting something done. It means business.
The question ought to be settled at once. Both the
great political parties of the country have repeatedly
declared in favor of a canal, and about every import
ant 'commercial or industrial organization in the
Union has urged prompt action. Examination after
examination has been made of the various routes and
all the facts that are obtainable are now in the posses
sion of Congress and the nation. ' It is clear there will
never be a unanimous agreement as to the route.
The danger is that between the advocates of the rival
enterprises Congress may be deadlocked for years to
come. In this Congress the , House of Representa
tives has passed a bill providing for the construction
of a canal by the Nicaragua route by an overwhelm
ing majority. That bill i s now threatened with defeat
in the Senate. Should the Senators pass a Panama
bill, it would probably; be defeated in the House. Thus
the work would be blocked. It would be a victory for
those who wish no canal at all.
In. this situation, Boards of Trade, Chambers of
Commerce andj.Other representative bodies should
urge upon Congress the adoption of the plan of pass
ing an isthmian, canal bill, leaving it to the President
"to determine which route is best. Senator Spooner
introduced a bill of that kind soon after the canal bill
was sent up from the House to the Senate.. The issue
therefore would not be a new one; nor would it re
quire any elaborate consideration. It has been fully
discussed in Congress anr 1 by the press and might
readily enough be adopted -t this session.
REPORTS from Washington are ominous of dis
aster to the hopes of those who have expected
the passage of an isthmian canal bill at this
session. The more the. subject is discussed the more
deeply marked appears the division between the ad
vocates of the Nicaragua route and those of the Pan
ama route. The volcanic eruption in the West Indies'
that seemed at one time to lead to a general accep
tance of the Panama line by reason of the menace of
volcanoes along the Nicaragua route has had no.
other effect than that of stirring up counter reports
of (earthquakes at Panama. Each side stands by its
guns and it looks as if there would be a long fight
before the finish. '.â¢' â¢
THE CANAL BILL.
Tlie ceremonies began, by the playing of
the "Star Spangled Banner" by the Uni
ted States Marine Band. President McFar
land of tlife Board of. Commissioners
then delivered an address. Chairman Wil
son H. Brown of the Joint Committee of
the Councils of Philadelphia responded
Following this the Marine Band played
Sousa's "Liberty Bell." The crowd was
then permitted to pass by the car. A
number of children were lifted into the
car, while little bunches of flowers from
other children were placed on the car.
During the exercises the minute-men of
the District, dressed In colonial uni
forms, took position in front of the car,
where they remained throughout the day!
The Marine and other bands remained
thrcughout the day and played selections.
The cA will proceed to Philadelphia Â«o^
morrow.
WASHINGTON, June 9.-The Liberty
Bell arrived here to-day, en route to Phil
adelphia, from the Charleston Exposition
where it was on exhibition. The arrival
of the bell was marked with brief patriot
ic exercises and thousands of people
passed before the car during the day and.
viewed the bell.
During the early part of the session the
naval appropriation , bill was considered.
All of the committee amendments were
disposed of except that relating to the
construction of two additional battleships,
two cruisers and two gunboats.
An interesting discussion' of the isth
mian canal project was made in- the Sen
ate to-day by Harris of Kansas, a member
of the Committee on In teroceanlc Canals,
v,-ho is also an engineer of recognized
ability. His discussion of the technical
details of canal construction was listened
to with profound attention. He strongly
advocated the selection of the Nlcaraguan
route. He maintained that it was entirely
feasible and practicable from an engineer
ing standpoint, and said that some of the
difficulties presented by the Panama route
were insuperable, notably. 1 the'eonstruc
tion'of the Bohlo dam. . .
Mondell of Wyoming and Shafroth of
Colorado supported the minority substi
tute. Bell of Colorado opposed the bill in
toto. No vote was reached. . Â¦ . '_ Â¦ â¢ .
The remainder of the day was devoted
to the bill to transfer certain forest-re
serves from the Interior Department to
the Aglcultural Department, and to au
thorize the creation in such reserves of
game and fish preserves. President Roose
velt in his annual message recommended
such a measure. The minority of the
Public Lands Gommittee offered a Senate
substitute for the bill, a measure which
eliminated that portion of the bill which
transfers the reserves to the Agricultural
Department. Lacey of Iowa, ,Kleberg of
Texas, Perkins of New York and Wil
liams of Missouri spoke in favor of the
bill. ' .'.''.
WASHINGTON, June 9.â The House
passed the bill to protect the President,
Vice President, members of the Cabinet
and foreign Ministers and Embassadors
and to suppress the teaching of anarchy
by a vote of j 175 to 38. A motion to re
commit the measure with instructions to
strike out certain sections was defeated
by a vote of 71 to 123.
As to the platform on which the. banqueters will
build the altar of harmony, it is hardly worth while
to speculate. Cleveland will doubtless assert one
doctrine and Bryan another. It will be left to David
Bennett Hill to adjust the planks and Henry Watter
son will spread over the structure a sufficient'num
ber of flowers of rhetoric to hide the cracks and cover
the points where the misfits meet. Mr. Watterson has
already declared there is no particular need for a plat
form. He has said, "Nothing should go into the plat
form which would tend to drive any one from the
party who supported it in 1896"; and we may infer
that he would also object to anything that would drive
away the Democrats who didn't support the candidate
of that year.-
In a recent issue of. the Courier- Journal Mr. Wat
terson says: "Why should we agitate ourselves over
the platforms of 1896 and 1900, on which we lost two
successive Presidential battles? If it be insisted that
we turn back for a platform, why not that of 1892
on which we won our last Presidential "battle? The
truth is, we should retrace nq footsteps, saddle our
selves with no handicaps, but, turning our backs upon
the past, cur faces to the future and'the foe, we should
gather in the ample- shelter of the old Democratic
The reappearance of the ex- President in the field
will be an interesting fact. ,He has been repudiated by
his party, hooted, hissed and denounced as a political
traitor. Now he is invited to come back and take the
highest. scat at the table. > Naturally there will be a
good deal of curiosity to hear what he is going to say,
and how the other banqueters will receive it. It is
to be hoped Bryan will not shirk the situation. The
country would like to have the pleasure of seeing the
"old" man" and the "boy orator" confronted at the
banquet board> talking harmony and mutual good
will. *
A meeting of such an assemblage of silver men and
gold men, Eastern men' and Western men, Tammany
men and anti-Tammany men, would An itself be a
marked incident in the politics of the day, but the
occasion is to have a brighter luster yet. It is an
nounced that Grover Cleveland has been invited as
the chief guest of the banquet and that he has ac
cepted and will make a speech.
An estimate of the comprehensive nature of the
banquet may be formed from the announcement that
upward of 1500 prominent Democrats have been in
vited to attend the feast. Among those who are ex
pected are: David B. Hill, William J. Bryan, Sen
ator Bacon of Georgia, Mayor Collins of Boston,
John D. Milburn of Buffalo, Richard Olney, the Rev!
Felix Adler, Bourke Cockran, William C. Whitney,
ex-Mayors Grace, Grant, Gilroy, Van Wyck, Hewitt,
Cooper, Edson and Ely, and Lewis Nixon.
ONE more vigorous effort is to. be. made by the
Democratic leaders in New York to formulate
a policy for the party before the Congres
sional campaigns begin. The new movement has
taken the form of a political association, to be known
as "The Tildeii Club." It is to be inaugurated on
the 19th of this month at a banquet, to which prom
inent Democrats of all sections of the country and all
shades of opinion have been invited. A sufficient
number of acceptances have been received to render
it certain that the occasion will be a notable one, and
once more^the hopes of the' reorganizes soar high.
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC RALLY.
"The man died six months ago. He has
left nothing subject to attachment save a
widow."â Evening Wisconsin.
A man wrote to/ a "Western lawyer for
information in regard to a person who
had owed him a considerable sum of
money for a long time.
"What property has he which I could
attach?" he asked.
The lawyer's reply was brief and to the
point.
"Then I don't -want it,", answered the
applicant. "My observation has been that
in order to hold a sinecure you've got to
do enough hard hustling in active politics
to earn the salary half a dozen times
over."â "Washington Star.
"That place you mention is regarded 0.3

LIBERTY BELL
ON EXHIBITION
AT WASHINGTON
a chance' to smile^
A Pennsylvania professor has been amusing himself
by telling the New York people that a mountain in
the neighborhood of that city was once an active vol
cano and is likely to resume activity at any time. The
New Yorkers are so frightened at the prospect' ot. a'
local Pelee that a good many of them are thinking
of going to Philadelphia, where they can be sure of
a quiet life. ' / ' '", :
FREE UTILITIES.
It is to be hoped that this advance step by the ad
vocates of public ownership will not at all check the
movement for entire reform in public accounting for
a plain and simple system of audit and account 'will
be more necessary under the proposed plan than it
is now. â¢
The new plan of supporting public utilities by tax
ation, and without further charge to the user, admits
everything that is charged against their administra
tion by charge and collection of rates. Granting that
it will economize their administration by io per'cent,
it still remains to be proved that their enjoyment by
the user will be any cheaper than under private admin
istration. The writer above quoted believes that it
will be cheaper, but there are others who believe that
even the essential activities of government, the police
fire and sanitary departments of 'city government'
could be run so much cheaper as a private business
proposition that the saving would constitute a satis
factory business profit
This concedes The Call's premise that public waste
is greater than corporate profit. The plan for can
celing out this element will no doubt now come into
focus in the discussion. Let us get rid of one error
that has already appeared in it. That which is paid
for in any form is not free. We owe this error to the
use of the term "free schools." That term originated
when it was expected that the landed endowment of
our public school system would suffice to support it,
without resort to taxation. That expectation proved
futile, because the lands have been disposed of un
timely and at their minimum value and the fund they
produced has to be supplemented by taxation that
is often complained cf as burdensome. The schools
are paid for, but not by rates exacted of their patrons,
and are free to none. Every renter is a taxpayer and
contributes by rent to support the schools in which
his children are educated, as does every owner of tax
able realty or personalty.
A California writer on the subject mistakenly calls
a water system supported entirely by taxation and
not at all by rates "a free water system," and says of
it: "In the first place it is more economical. The
cost of accounting and collecting is done away with.
I have looked over the reports of cities having so
called municipal systems, and I find that the cost of
keeping the accounts with consumers arid the
collection of water rates amounts in many
cases to over io per cent of the entire op
erating expenses. If this could be dispensed with the
saving would be very material. If this item of ex
pense could be abolished there would be no question
but that public operation would be cheaper than pri
vate operation." â¢
As every investigation has shown that such utilities
are operated at a greater cost than in private hands,
and that public waste more than equals corporate
profit, it is now proposed that the fixing and collec
tion of rates be entirely abandoned. Water, light and
street railroad systems are to be supported directly
by taxation and be free to the use of all without any
further charge. It is claimed that under such a sys
tem it will be positively shown that such utilities will
be furnished cheaper than is possible by private cap
ital.
THE persistent demand for reform in public ac
counting has caused the proponents of public
ownership and operation of public utilities to
take a very important advance step.

ANARCHY BILL
IS PASSED BY
BIG MAJORITY
THE CHIEF topic in railroad circles
yesterday was' the promotion by
President E. H. Harriman of the
Southern. Pacific Company of three
old time officials or the road.
To-day a circular will be sent through
out the "Yellow/Building" notifying the
Southern Patiflc Company employes that
in the future J. "Wilder, who for so many
years has been freight auditor for the
company, with headquarters at Fourth
and Townsend streets, has been promoted
to the position of assistant auditor of the
Southern "Pacific and â¢will remove his of
fices tothe : Wells-Fargo building.
D. W. Horsburgh, who has been for
many years assistant freight auditor of
the Southern Pacific will from to-day 'on
be freight auditor and Henry S. Lincoln
will be his assistant.
The news of the promotion of the three
officials comes as a pleasant surprise to
their friends. Wilder entered the service
of the Central Pacific. way back in 1S68
and was made freight auditor of the road
in 1872, which office he has held up to date.
He is a very popular railroad man and is
deemed strict. yet just.
D. W. Horsburgh, who succeeds Mr
Wilder as freight auditor, has been in the
employ of the Southern Pacific for thirty
years and during that time has been
twenty years assistant freight auditor.
He is deemed one of the most honorable
and painstaking officials in the employ of
the company and his promotion is held
to be well earned.
Henry S. Lincoln won his spurs as con
fidential clerk to J. G. Stubbs, the great
railroad traffic man. Mr. Lincoln was the
right hand man of Mr. Stubbs fromlSSl
to 1901.
The circular which will be issued to-day
It seems almost useless to warn the public against
frauds of this kind. Again and again the newspapers
of the country have had occasion vta'-expose some
bare-faced swindle carried on under the form of some
kind of investment company, and yet the warning
contained in the exposure doe^ little good.- No sooner
,is one rascal captured and imprisoned than another
appears and does a thriving trade. Nor is it always
the poor and the ignorant who are deceived. Some of
the "get rich quick" concerns have found dupes
among all classes of business men. By excluding
their circulars and letters from the mails' the Gov
ernment can. do something to check the evil, and it
is gratifying to know it is to be done; The Govern
ment cannot consent to permit its energies and agen
cies to be made use of for purposes of fraud.
A recent report on the subject says: "The informa
tion already secured was reported by one officer, whose
inspection tour included less than four weeks' work in
a small part of the country. The inspector reports
that there are some thirty firms in Kansas City, be
tvveen_ thirty and forty in Chicago, nearly twenty in
Louisville, eight in Des Moines, and from seven to
twenty in various places throughout the West, from
Lexington, Ky., to Denver, Colo. He said that they
had exhausted the vocabulary of corporation litera
ture."
Most of the dupes of 'the swindlers are working men
and women, have been' induced to make invest
ments in the;various schemes in the fond hope of de
riving a profit. Many of the so-called companies are
new. The profits must be large, for.it is said-they
are springing up rapidly all over the Mississippi Val
ley. Short as has been, their career, however, the
complaints concerning them are already numerous,
and the Postoffice Department has' ample evidence
against them to justify their exclusion from the mails.
WHILE the Government at Washington is in
no sense paternal and does not undertake to
prevent a fool from acting according to his
,folly r and Soon parting himself from his money, yet
} l d 95 s undertake- to prevent fraudulent schemers from
"using, the agencies of the Government in enticing the
unwary to. part with their coin. The Postoffice De
partment has- most to do with 'frauds of this kind,
since it is by means of the mails that the swindlers
most frequently get" into- communication with their
dupes.;" Recently the department has been especially
active' inj.ja'uppressing' fraudulent enterprises' carried
on through the; mails, and according to reports from
Washing|on ; a grea* deal' of good has : bean- accom
plished. 'â¢Â¦'.; ;.::; -.,-;;. ; ; v V "V Â¦- :.:â¢â¢
Of late;the attention: of -the fraud order division of
the office has ; been 'directed to- what are -known W 1
"home corporation:: and '.''bond 1 investment", schemes.
Such 'schemes, it is -said, are ; being worked more ex
tensively and; more ;^ in the West than in
any^otherVart; of- the. country. . An official report sub
mitted to the Postmaster General estimates these
questionable companies have already contracted lia
bilities amounting to- upward of $50,000,060, while
their total available'assets do not equal one-tenth of
that amount. ' '

It is said to be evident that the Cuban reciprocity

be the satisfaction at having a visit from so many men
of wealth and worth from distant. States'. The Amer
ican custom of holding conventions and assembling in
large masses" has an important effect in developing
a true sense of unity of the people of the whole coun
try and cultivating frie'ndly relations among those
who live in the. farthest separated States. The Shrin-^
ers who have crossed the hot sands from the East
will carry back to. their homes' a memory of some
thing more than the demonstration of the worth of
their order. They will have a fuller realization 6f the
greatness of the republic and the essential oneness of
the vast population of their fellow countrymen. They
will return to add new commendations to the many
pronounced by former travelers upon our State and
our city, and thuls help us to advance until California
holds in the Union; the place to which her natural
gifts entitle her.
, The week of the Mystic Shriners is going to be
something like a grand holiday. The gorgeous uni
forms, the bright colors of banners and flags, the
sparkle of medals and insignia, the blare of trumpets
and the roll cf drums, will enliven the city and give
to our accustomed occidental ways something of the
mystery and the pomp of the marvelous lands where
the crescent and the cross struggled for mastery in the
old days when knighthood was in flower and Arabian
culture was the admiration of the world.
Fortunately we shall have to put no constraint upon
ourselves to make the welcome manifest and notable.
The more that come, the merrier will the welcome be.
We can never be weary of entertaining our kinsmen
of the East and showing them how far California sur
passes anything they ever saw at home. In shorty we
have a double satisfaction in greeting all who came;
first, that of receiving visitors whom we -are pleased
to meet, and second, that of exhibiting the beauties
and the splendors of our matchless State.
California has long been the "excursion State" of
the Union and San Francisco is rapidly becoming the
chief summer convention city. Last season we had
a host of visitors within our gates, and this year will
see our streets thronged by a host more numerous
still. By reason of the prestige we have acquired in
that, way a new glory has come to us and a new re
sponsibility rests upon us. From this tirne >on we
shall doubtless have every summer a great throng of
visitors from all parts of the Union, and it will be
our duty to maintain undiminished the repute of hos
pitality that has come down to us from the days of the
pioneers.
FOR the Mystic Shriners San Francisco has a
welcome ardent as the Orient and lavish as the
West. -To reach us many of them have liter
ally "crossed the hot sands." â¢ They will find this
city a true midsummer oasis, the like of which exists
nowhere else on the globe.

'there, saying to ourselves and to one anotherâ saying

That, then, may be taken as the slogan. The Dem;

"By the Eternal, bygones shall be bygones." In that
case, however, the country would like to know why
Cleveland is to be brought from retirement and Bryan

The fifth period was fine, continued play

In the sixth period the Americans ran
away with the ball and hit the goal, but
unluckily they had a man off side and
the goal was canceled. In spite of this
the American team held on with great

The annual entertainment given by the
nurses of the Homeopathic Sanatorium
was held last night at the nurses' cot
tage on Central avenue. There were none
but the nurses and their immediate
'rh'e deception room of the cottage had
been made gay with numerous beautiful
floral gifts sent the young ladles by many
who had been under their care. Parlor
games had been arranged and, of course,
there was among the amusements offered
the now famous ping pong, for which
there were dainty prizes. One of the most
amusing of the games, however, was the
improvised "fish-pond," which contained
all manner of ridiculous articles
The young ladies were armed with small
fishing rods and as each one would bring
up from the water a dilapidated shoe or
an old straw hat, a toy kitten and other
things equally ludicrous there would be
an outburst of hearty laughter. Ping
pon? was voted out of service after the
amusement derived from the "fish-pond"
game.
During the evening there was singing
and Instrumental music.

ANNUAL ENTERTAINMENT
HURLINGHAM, June 9.â The dis
appointment caused by the post
ponement of Saturday last had
some influence In keeping down
the size of the fashionable crowd
which assembled at Hurlingham this aX
ternoon to witness the second game in the
series being played for the American
polo cup. .
The betting before the opening of tho
game was *till in favor of England, in
spite of the American success in the first
game of the series played May 31. A num
ber of wagers were made at 5 to 4 on the
Englishmen. A little rain fell a few min
utes before the match began.
The teams were as follows:
Americansâ R. L. Agasslz, J. E. Coudln,
Foxhall Keene and Lawrence Waterbury.
British.â Cecil Nickalls, Frederick â¢ Freake,
George Miller and Walter H. Buckmaster.
The game opened In a lively manner.
The play started with a fierce rush by
the Americans toward the English goal.
The ball was kept there for some time,
but finally the British forced it back,
threatening the American goal so danger-

All arrangements have been concluded
for GÂ«orge Gardner to go to Chicago and

gains telegraphed for tickets, and as soon
as they arrive he* will depart with his
protege for the scene of future hostilities.
Gardner and O'Brien will weigh in at 162
pounds. Gardner is doing light work, pre
paratory for his bout.
Manager Alec Greggains stated yester
day that this morning he would sign a
contract for the erection of a building at
Valencia and Fourteenth streets, in wnich
to bring off the championship' battle be
tween itobert Fitzsimmons and James J.
Jeffries. He said the contract would be
let to William Faber, the carpenter who
has always looked after Woodward's Pa
vilion. The new structure svill be imme
diately opposite this pavilion. It will be
a wooden structure and large enough :o
accommodate 15,000 people. Greggains
thinks the cost of this building will be far
less than the price which the people who
control Mechanics* Pavilion wish to
charge for its rentaLf He further stated
that seats in the gallery will be sold for
$5 each, and the chairs close to the ring
will be disposed of for prices that are
higher, but reasonable.

to fight Britt and it has failed to live
up to its agreement. McFaaden said hs
would not shirk a match with Gans, as
he was certain he could defeat him. Mc-
Fadden says, however, he will not box
Gans unless the latter enters the ring at
the lightweight limit, 133 pounds. He
claims Gans has hard work making the
weight, and he will insist on his coming
down to it. â¢ .
Gans is on his way and should reach

THE HAUL BRUSH
Breeds Dandruff, Which. Causes Fall-
ing Hair and Finally Baldness.
Professor Unna, Hamburg, Germany,
European authority on skin diseases, says
that dandruff is as contagious as any oth-
er malevolent disease, and that one com-
mon source of the spread of dandruff is
the use of the same hair brush by differ-
ent persons. The way to avoid catching
dandruff or any other disease from an-
other's brush is to Insist on the use of
Newbro's Herpiclde. It not only kills the
dandruff germ, but it is also an antiseptic
that will prevent, the catching of any dis-
ease whatever through contagion of an-
other's brush.

Barnes denies that he threatened the

house on Sunday morning by Captain An
derson to take the girl to the Chief to
make her statement, as her stepfather
had told him that she had been bribed
with the box of candy and 50 cents to tes

the Chief. He went to the nousÂ© Satur
day to flnd out why she had not told the
truth.
Captain Martin said he would lay the
matter before Chief Wittman, and Glover
said ho would formally â¢ prefer a charge
against Barnes and would see that a war

on the girl, as he alleged Barnes had

before Captain Martin, and . she stated
that Barnes had called at her house Sat
urday and had called her a liar for testi
fying as she had, and threatened to take
her. to, the Magdalen Asylum to teach her
not to . testify against a police officer.
Barnes had again called at the house
atout 7 o'clock Sunday morning, saying
he had been sent by the Chief of Police
to take the girl to the Hall of Justice,
as she would have to suffer for perjuring
herself. The girl went with him to the
Hall -of Justice, accompanied by her un
cle, George Walcomb, and after being
kept there for some time was sent home
by Sergeant Brown.
When the case of Mrs. Henzi was
called in court yesterday Barnes made a
statement that Attorneys Safford and
Glover, '.who "represented Mrs. Johnson,
had bribed the girl to testify against him
by giving her a box of candy and 50 cents.
Glover at once denied the statement, and
retorted that Barnes had been intimidat-.

the controversy and ; continued Mrs v

neglect, Nora Whitaker from F. M. Whit
aker for desertion, J. W. Blundell from
Agnes B. Blundell for desertion and Ura
nia Quaid from D. J. Quaid for neglect.
Irwin R, Colbrandt has brought a suit
for divorce against Ada H. Colbrandt for
desertion. He alleges that she left him
last May. They were married in March,
1899, and have one child, who has been in
the custody of Mrs. Rose Bernard for the
last year.
-"I will continue this matter unui to
morrow at noon, when I shall expect you
to have proof, in the shape of the books
of the railroad company, that your client
is speaking the truth."
"Well, he has not shown it." said Ker
rigan. "The testimony in the divorce pro- )
ceedings last October showed that . he
treated his wife with gross cruelty, and
his conduct since then has not placed him
in the favor of this court. Me has not
paid his wife a cent of alimony since last
March, "and I want to say right here that
1 am not at all disposed to treat him with
any leniency.
Eagan offers as an excuse for his action
that he has been on a vacation and has
not been in receipt of his usual salary,
but Judge Kerrigan intimated that he did
not place much credence in the statement.
"This man is willing to support his fam
ily," vouchsafed Eagan's attorney as _is
client left the witness stand.
/
Thomas' B. Eagan, a foreman of con
struction of the United Railroads, learned
yesterday in Judge Kerrigan's court that
the practice of refusing to obey a court
order would lead him into difficulties and
place him in an unenviable light before
the world." He appeared before Judge
Kerrigan yesterday on an order to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court for allowing his di
vorced wife and seven children to. remain
in want when he had been ordered by the
court to contribute $65 a month for their
support. This is Eagan's third appear
ance before Judge Kerrigan on orders to
show cause, and the court informed him
in very plain language that his conduct
was despicable in the extreme.
Informs Delinquent That He
Is Not in Favor With
Court
Rebukes a Railroad Em
ployÂ© for Failure to
Pay Alimony.

What is good soap?
PearsV
No harm! It leaves the
skin soft like a baby's ; no
alkali in it, nothing but
soap. The harm is done by
alkali. Still more harm is
done by not washing. So,
bad soap is better than
none.
It is a wonderful soap
that takes hold quick and
does no harm.

Califondans in New York.
NEW YORK, June 9.â The following
Calif ornians are In New York:
Detectives Dinan and Wren have beÂ«n
working Bteadily in their efforts to locate
the accomplices of William White, fore
man In the liquor department of Olson
& Co., grocers, 715 Market street, who
was arrested last Friday on two charges
of grand larceny. They have succeeded
and yesterday morning secured warrants
from Judge Cabaniss for the arrest of
Owen Heffernan and "John DoÂ«" John
ston. Johnston carted the stolen liquor
away from the store and Heffernan sold
It to saloon-keepers and others In the
"tenderloin." Johnston used to bÂ© train
er for George Green, the pugilist.
White appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday on the two charges of grand
larceny. He -was Instructed and arraigned
and the cases .were continued till to-mor
row for the preliminary hearing. It Is
estimated that during the last month
White with the aid of his two accom
plices has stolen between $2000 and 13000
worth of the best brands of liquor.
POLICE HAVE LOCATED

Irving M. Scott said last night that all
he knew of the shipbuilders' combine was
gleaned from the columns of The Call. He
denied that the Union Iron Works had
entered Into such a combine.
L.OS ANGELES, June 9.âH. E. Huntlnj
ton Is In New York. Superintendent Ran
dolph of his lines denies all knowledge of
Huntlngton's shipbuilding Interests ex
cept the fact that he owns the shipyards
at Newport News, Va. ; '<;
Douglas G. Moore, who is connected
with the Crescent Iron Worka, also con
firmed the report that the deal had been
completed, and that an announcement
would be made to-day. He said: "An op
tion has been given to the plant of the
Crescent Iron Works, and other options
are held on plants scattered along the At
lantic seaboard, and at least two plants on
the Pacific are to be absorbed."
Lewis Nikon, who has been most active
In bringing about the combination, again
refused to-day to discuss hi3 plans, but
one who has been associated with him
during the last month in the work ot
forming the new corporation said: "You
may say that the deal is completed. The
only reasons why formal announcement
was not made to-day Is that the more Im
portant details occupied the time until It
was too late to properly frame what la to
be said to the public. ' That will be done
to-morrow. The securities have been
written and one of the strongest banking
Institutions in the city will accept sub
scriptions. The men who have pledged
their credit to the enterprise guarantee ita
success."
NEW YORK, June 9.â All but the merest
formalities of the plan to combine several
of the big shipbuilding yards ot the coun
try under one management were com
pleted to-day. A lew papers remain yet
to be signed, and for this purpose a meet
ing of those most interested win be held
to-morrow morning:, alter whicn formal
announcement will t>e maue and the secu
rities of the new corporation will be offer
ed to the public. In spite of the extreme
reticence of the men who are promoting
the formation of the combination, It was*
learned to-day that the plans contemplate
a company which will turn out any Kind
of vessel, from a steamship of small di
mensions to a battleship weighted down
with the heaviest of armor. Iron and
steel works are being negotiated for, and
It is understood that several extensive
plants have been purchased, among them
the Crescent Iron Works at Ellzabethport,
New Jersey.

BLOEMFONTEIN, Orange River Col
ony, June 9.â A strong contrast to the
feeling between Boer and Briton Is the
bitterness existing between the burghers
who are surrendering under the peace
terms and' those Boers who surrendered
during the campaign. When the Boer
leaders came to Bloemfonteln, previous to
the conclusion of peace, they curtly re
fused to shake hands with those who had
previously surrendered. : The general be
lief is that relations between these two
classes of Boers. will be embittered for a
lone time.
WASHINGTON, June 9.â President

It is probable that within . a very short
time extensive litigation will be com
menced which will involve the heirs of
thVlate Adolph Sutro in a legal battle
that will last for a long time. Sutro !n
his will left the Cliff House property and
land known as the San Miguel rancho in
trust to 'the 'Mayor 'of this city, the Pra-
Bidlng Judge of the Superior Court, the
president \ of the Chamber of Commerce
and Judge "W. W. Morrow of the Circuit
Court for educational and scientific pur
poses. The clause was -declared invalid
two years, ago in the Superior Court on
the ground that it established a per
petuity. Â¦
Recently the matter was looked into and
It was found that the suit- which brought
about the invalidating of the clause had
been brought against the executors of the
estate, when the (trustees should have
been made defendants. Yesterday a num
ber of citations directing the appearance
in court of ' the I trustees " were issued.

shire Hotel last evening. The
ceremony was performed by Rev. George
C. Adams, pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church, of which the groom Is a
member. W. E. F. Deal, the well-known
attorney, gave the bride. Into the keeping
of the groom, iThe floral decorations were
artistic and novel in many respects. It
was a pink and white wedding. The bridal
bower in one corner of the drawing-room
was of pink net and many clusters of
gypsy pillow tied with ribbons of white
and leaf green. Odd baskets of ferns
were also interspersed. The mantel was
banked in with Bride roses, over which
was an immense white wreath tied with ,
pink ribbons. An aisle leading to the
bower was of pink and white sweet peas.
The halls were done in ferns and potted
palms. Grape vines were effectively ar
ranged in the banquet room and the ta
bles were elaborately decorated with yel-
I low coreopsis and maidenhair ferns.
The bride was beautiful and charming
in a shell pink chiffon, the elegance and
simplicity of which suited her face and
splendid figure. The gown was a close
fitting affair of solidly shirred tucks. The
clinging skirt flared about the feet in
three graduated flounces, edged with
three broad tucks. ' The shirred bodice
had a transparent yoke of tucked chiffon
and a bertha and collar of real Duchess
lace. The sleeves were of shirred tucks
to the elbow, with a flowing effect below,
caught in at the hand with shirred chif
fon. A pink aigrette. completed the toi
lette.
The nuptials were followed by a recep
tion and' supper. The bride is an Eastern
weman of liberal education and refine-,
ment,- who has lived irt Los Angeles and
this city for several years. Many of her
Los Angeles friends came up for the wed
ding. . ,
Mr. Foulks is an old-time resident of
this city, having graduated from the
Boys' High School and the University of

Judge Melvln's instructions to the Jury
were formal. He told them that thÂ«re
were two classes of crime that they must
Investigate, that which was charged in

make 3. complaint and corruption in pub
lic officials. - --.'; :ââ¢
The Grand Jury met at once and de
cided upon a line of Investigation. A
number of subpenas were prepared this
ulternoon and will be served to-morrow
morning ordering the witnesses to appear
it 10 o'clock to-morrow before the in
quisitors. The list Is known to include
INSTRUCTIONS FORMAL.
The drawing of the Grand Jury was
purely formal. There was no anxiety ex
hibited by the thirty men who had been
summoned to serve. J. II. Dieckman, D.
C. Owen. Walter G. Manuel. A. L,. Ott,
J. C. Whlpple, It. A. Leet. George Beck
and J. H. Umphred were all excused. The
Grand Jury as finally constituted stands:
H. E. Feusier, Joseph Ghirardelli. D. Stef

Daniel Luce. A. J. Tait. Samuel Haywood,
Ernest Schween, Gustave Mayrich, H.

K. G. Saston, Thomas Corder. Fred
Wuescher &nd H. A. RancTiett. Gilbert L.
Curtiss was appointed foreman and John
W. Tompkins secretary. \
What the defense will be is a matter ot
conjecture. Daniels and Dalton never
have said that the books were made or
delivered, and certainly the only books
that have been offered represent scarcely
half of the total order. It is said by some
that Daniels and Dalton will try to make
a scapegoat cf Russel R. Stedman, the
confidential advertising man of the En
quirer, who made the affidavit that^the
Uockfi had never been made nor delivered.
Neither Daniels nor Dalton bear Stedman
any love for his affidavit, and It is said
that either the books or the money will
be passed up to Stedman.
On the other hand, Stedman says that It
was to avoid anything of this kind that
he made the affidavit that caused all the
trouble.
DEFENSE A QUESTION.
But Daniels has refused to bite and
maintains a stony silence, and the indica
tions are that the result of the slow ac
tion of the Grand Jury will have to be
awaited.
This is not what is desired by those who
are forcing the charge that these books
were paid for but never delivered. They
are desirous that the examination in de-
Udl be given to the public. If Daniels
could be goaded into suing Moffitt for
libel there would then be a chance to
thresh out the whole affair, from the way
In which the Enquirer was secured by
Daniels to the troubles between Daniels.
Dalton. Pardee and D. Edward Collins,
the minority stockholder, down to the
latest charge of collecting money from
the county for work that was never done.
This is what Is desired, ar.d Moffitt would
be very willing to pay $000 for bringing it
Into court-
But behind the Moffitt attacks upon
Daniels, coupled with his unique offer to
pay the expenses cf a suit against him
self for libel, there is more method than
madness. These who are forcing the
tighL. against Daniels and Dalton do_not
Uit^ the fact that the matter has been
referred to the Grand Jury. The Grand
Jury is a secret body and it is difficult
to secure much, if any, of its proceedings.
All that ever comes from the Grand Jury
room is the simple result.
METHOD I2T HIS OFFER.
But none found Mr. Daniels, and he,
too, went home alive and in possession of
xll his limbs.
Editor G. B. Daniels came down town
just as early. He went to his office, and
then made visits to several of his friends
and his attorneys, and was about the
streets during the greater part of the day.
During the afternoon there was a con
ference between Mr. Daniels and some
of his friends and his attorneys in his
office. Like Mr. Mcffitt, he made it very
evident that he v.-as about town, and that
he was to be found in his office.
But nothing happened and shortly be
fore dinner time Mr. Moffitt went to his
home, uninjured and unsued.
â¢During his trip3 about town he engaged
in conversation with several persons. To
these he repeated his written statements
in varying form. He wanted to have
Daniels sue him, and if there was any
Question as to where or how he could be
found he would soon settle that.
Hj had 5500 ready to pay for Daniels'
ilbel suit at the moment it was filed.
h ra.UK J. Moffitt came down town unus
ually early. He made several turns up
ana down Bro.xiway, along his usual
route, and at his usual haunts. If any
thing he was a little more in evidence to
day than tisuai. There tras Just an in
dication that the author of the attack
upon, the editor wanted to see if any
oae was looking for him in his usual
haunts and so none of them were omit
ted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
Â¦ 111S Broadway, June 8.
Tho Grand Jury was drawn to-day, or
ganized and settled down to the work
:Â«f investigating the charge made
atainst G. B. Daniels and Henry
K Dalton that they collected money from
Alamefia County lor work that was never
dune. It seemed thai the many contending
persons ar.d factions had agreed almost
to let the official inquisitors take theii
course uninterrupted, for G. B. Daniels
maintained more than his usual silence
iiid Frank J. MofStt contented himself
with saying:
"Mr. .Daniels in his paper this evening
does r.ct malign me or refer to me in an
untruthful or unpk-asant manner. Hence
I nave nothing to say."
Mr. Daniels' statement was simply:
'"I am attending to the Grand Jury just
ngw. When 1 get through with them I
will attend to Mr. Mcffitt."
So those who expected that Frank J.
Mcffitt and Editor G. B. Daniels would
make the streets of Oakland swim with
gore were very much disappointed.
The people of the business portion of
OaJtland . were watching for tne former
editor and the present editor and thÂ»y
wondered if a meetiii^' would be sought
of avoided. The bitterness of Moffltfs at
tcck upon Daniels, the directness of his
challenge and the unique offer of Mofhit
tcr contribute ?500 toward the expenses of
Darnels if the latter wouid sue him for
lioei all contributed to make the Oakland
tongue wagr in breathless expectation of
wiiat might happen. . .* .
But nothing happened that required the
services of -either Coroner, police or hos
pitÂ£l. . .

"I am sorry that the case has cul
minated so seriously," he said when seten
last night. "When the public learns of
the disgraceful melee that occurred there
last night I am sure it will hurt the busi
ness. I went in there quietly and peace
ably with my party and before I knew it
three ruffianly bartenders had us covered
with new revolvers, evidently bought for
the purpose. However, these sort of ac
tions will not dissuade me from my pur
pose. I will have justice done meat any
cost. I suppose other attachments will
follow the one issued to-day. I don't
blame people to whom money is owed for
getting frightened when they hear of such
disgraceful scenes as have happened there
einee Choynski took charge of the busi
ness." .'Â¦â¢Â¦..
Mr. Newman was rather worried over
the strenuous "turn the row over posses
sion of the saloon took last nisht. He
thinks it will cause a vast falling off of
business and permanently injure the rep
utation of. the saloon. â¢
The row over the possession of the
Richelieu saloon, which has been In pro
gress between Herbert Choynski % and
Charles Newman for over a week, came
near ending in a serious shooting affray
last night. Newman, accompanied by his
brother, George Baker, his attorney. Mose
Getz and a barkeeper, entered the saloon
about 8 o'clock, just as Choynskt and his
barkeepers and several fighting men were
assuming possession of the- place after
Choynski had raised an attachment that
had been issued against the quarreling
firm earlier in the day. When the Deputy
Sheriff who was in charge opened the
doors of the saloon, which had been closed
since 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Choynski
and his supporters stepped Into the
saloon, closely followed by the Newman
contingent. Choynski ordered Newman
out of the place. Choynskl's three bar
tenders were by this time behind the bar
and all three of them pulled revolvers and
pointed the weapons at Newman and his
party, and while the men behind the bar
kept the opposing party Â«at bay Choynski
ordered Newman and his friends to leave
the place immediately. They retired
quietly to the street, leaving Choynski
and his armed bartenders in possession.
The attachment issued yesterday was
sworn out by a collector warned Isaacs
on behalf of William Wolf, the wholesale
liquor dealer. After the Sheriff's office
closed last night Choynski made a flank
movement and raised the attachment .by
placing $2000 in cash in the hands of Sher
iff Laekmann. Â¦ â¢ â¢

OP THE PACIFIC COAST
OXNARD, June 9.â Four Mexicans ' en
gaged in mortal combat here at 12:30
o'clock this morning. Three of them are
now in the County Hospital. The county
surgeon says that two men cannot live
and the third has only a bare chance. The
fcurth is in the County Jail In Ventura.
The participants in the affray used re
volvers and knives. The wounded are:
Santiago Fernandez,- shot In the jaw
with a pistol, the bullet lodging in his
head.
Eduardo Acosta, shot in the back, bul
let taken from the breast.
Miguel Fabiola, suffering from' knife
wounds in the back.
The imprisoned Mexican Is Joe Guitano.
The affray occurred In the Mexican set
tlement. Within a few minutes : the en
tire neighborhood was aroused. When
omcers arrived on the battle ground throe
cambatants were unable to continue the
fight or offer resistance. Neighbors cap
tured Guitano without much trouble, as
he was exhausted.'
The trouble originated with a family
affair. Some weeks ago the wife of Fer
nandez obtained a divorce. She is Gui
tano's mother.
The two men were quarreling when
Acosta and Fabiola attempted to inter
fere. Acosta and Guitano have long been
enemies, owing . to attentions alleged to
have been paid by the former to Guitano's
wife. The quarrel soon became a melee,
in which all four men were participants.
According to the reports, Fernandez
stabbed Fabiola and Guitano did the*
shooting, wounding Fernandez and
Acosta.
"But," said the banker, "there have
been certain business transactions
through this bank whereby I know the
report to be true."
Something definite will be known soon.
as Hooker's option will expire about
July L .i
One thing that substantiates the belief
that it means a new sugar factory is the
fact that a few days ago S. H. Brown, a
furniture dealer of this place, was In Los
Angeles, and in conversation with a
friend, who is connected with a bank in
that city, the latter made the remark that
Oxnard was to have another sugar fac
tory. To this Brown replied that he did
not believe there was anything in the re
port.
Peile was practically the only one who
krew of this transaction, and he kept It
Quiet until a few days ago, when .he re
ceived a letter from Hooker, dated Phila
delphia. This letter simply announced
that Hooker's project was going through
all right and that he would be heard from
Boon.
There arrived in Oxnard about May 1 a
gentleman who kept his mission and even
nis name a secret. He hired a livery rig
and took a lung drive about- the valley,
making inquiries regarding the water sup
piy, etc. Several days after he left
Cniirles S. Jfeile. a local real estate agent,
received a letter from H. C. Hooker,
dated Los Angeles, asking for terms upon
certain pieces of land in the vicinity of
Oxnard. Feile mailed the requested in
formation and soon afterward received a
telegram stating that Hooker was coming
to Oxrard and desired to have Peile meet
him at the station with a carriage. This
was done, and Hooker requested that he
be taken to see some land east of town.
He would give no information, except
that the land should be near the railroad,
have plenty of water and be so situated
as to give a direct fall to the ocean.
The&e requirements were met in a tract
of 126 acres three miles east of Oxnard,
belonging to John G. HilL Hooker asked
fcr a sixty-day option on this property,
which was given him, and he deposited
money to bind the bargain. As it was then
nearly train time, Hooker drove to the
etation. Peile was naturally anxious to
know what it all meant and asked to be
enlightened. Hooker's reply was:
"If any one asks you, just tell them, you
don't know."
With this the gentleman left for Los
Angeles.
OXNARD, June 9.â H. C. Hooker of
Philadelphia has obtained a sixty-day op
tion on 136 acres of land three miles east
of Oxnard, and If reports are true this
vicinity is soon to have another immense
sugar factory. What is puzzling the pop
ulace is the mystery connected with the
negotiations, which yield no information
as to what interests Hooker represents.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs. \ '
The : week opened with Â¦ large â¢ receipts cf
Butter, as will be seen. . Prices showed no.
change, but the feeling was unquestionably
easy, with more- sellers than buyers. The pro-'
posed introduction of oleomargarine Into the
California market by a large Chicago concern
is agitating the trade, especially as a local
factory proposes to follow suit. Dealers say
that contractors for lumber, Â¦ railroad and fish
ing camps are large buyers of oleomargarine
whenever It is on the market, and that a cer
tain class of bakers also use it freely, so that
the imitation product will be very apt to pro
duce a depressing effect on packed Butter later
on In the season. This has a tendency to
check the current packing of fresh Butter and
is an additional element of weakness. An ac
count of the action â¢ of Â¦ the Dairy Exchange in
the matter yesterday appears in the local
columns.
. Further changes In Cheese will be noted. Old
is now in such meager supply that few if any
dealers are quoting it. Supplies of new, while
sufficient for current needs, are not as ex
cessive as they have been. '
Ranch Eggs are quoted higher by "most
houses, though receipts showed a marked .in
crease yesterday. Spot stocks of Eggs are ap
parently lighter and the feeling is, rather firm
than otherwise. . *
Receipts were 79,100 pounds, 276 cubes and
4 kegs of Butter, 1362 cases, of - Eggs, -400
cases of Eastern Eggs, 5600 pounds of Califor
nia Cheese and pounds of Oregon Cheese.

NEW YORK, June 9.â The dullness of the
tradine in stocks was unrelieved to-day, but
the inertia of prices was not quite so absolute.
There was a scattering distribution of buying
orders during the early trading which lifted
prices slightly. The demand subsequently dlel
away, but the higher level of prices was pretty
well maintained during the rest of the day.
News of weather conditions favorable to ail
of the crops seemed to be the cause of the
buying, which was most prominent in Atchi
son. That Mock and St. Paul were moved up
a point. Vasrue rumors were current all day
of a coming settlement of the coal strike and
operators in stocks DrofeHsed satisfaction over
the small effect of the soft coal miners' strike,
ine public statement made on behalf of the
anthracite operators declaring themselves sat
isfied with the success attained in preventing
damage to the mines by flooding was also cited
by buyers of stocks. The presence to-day of
the United States Commissioner of Labor anl
the interest in the strike thus manifested on
oenalf of the President were variously re
garded. The question of statutory power of
the President to acti\ely Intervene, however,
seemed to afford most satisfaction to those in
terested In stocks. , Reading's gain reached a
point. The rise of 1% in Hocking Valley was
apparently due to the fact that the labor
trouble. has .not affected Its territory. Sugar
had the benefit of a rise in the price of renned
product and of hopes of an agreement on

steady decrease in temperature, and on the

CHICAGO, June 9.â Wheat was depressed by
the fine weather more . than by anything else/
For several days the' short interest had been
much worried over the prospects of damage to
winter wheat by a wet ; harvest. In ' conse
quence there .'was , considerable", covering .and
the bulls bought recently to a fair extent. To
day all this was changed when 'the weather
map showed clear weather prevailing general
ly.. The Southwestern markets were weak at '
the start, St. Louis being down and selling
here on the weather. : The local crowd was very
bearish at the start and July opened %@%c to
%c down at 71%c to 71%@71%c, ; and soon
tumbled to 71 % c. The cessation of a demand
from shorts eliminated the otherwise bullish in
fluences that might have been expected from
a decrease of 2,640,000 bushels in the on-passage
stuff, and of 2,613,000 bushels in the! visible
supply. Even some talk of exporting new stuff
and a fair show of strength at-New York on
the French demand at weakened prices had no
effect. Wheat was very heavy and seemed un
able to help itself, ana as no support came to
its aid, the close was weak, July l@l%c lower
at 71%@71%c.
â¢ Corn opened 'off sharply on favorable weather
for cultivation and on free offerings. ! There
was, . however, active buying of July Â¦: by the
big bull party that is supposed, to be in con-,
trol of that option. July closed weak, %@%c
down at <>2%<8>62%. :
Oats broke with the other grains and ruled
weak. July closed weak, %@%c down at
38%c. Â¦â¢'..
Â¦ Provisions did not Â¦ feel the grain influence
and were pushed up to f higher prices. ' Hogs
were higher,, there was a. fair demand by shorts
and little stuff was offered by the packers who
control all the holdings. July pork closed 7%c
up, lard closed 6@7%c up and ribs 20c higher.

Lemons were firmer under a steady demand
and light supplies. Supplies of fancy Oranges
were limited and , top prices were easily ob

sold as follows: Navels, $3 73 for 2S boxes of
fancy and $2 25 for choice; choice Valencias.
$1 50@2 75; Seedlings. $2 15 for fancy and

Three more crates of Nutmeg Melons came
in from Yuraa. They contained from 12 to 15
Melons each and were sold at the uniform
price of $5 per crate.
Receipts of new green fruits continue light
and prices stand about the same.
Apricots were offering freely and common
stock was a little lower. Fancy Seedlings in
small boxes sold readily at full figures.
Cherries showed little change and the mar
ket-was well cleaned up at the end of the
day. The demand for loose stock was par
ticularly brisk and It was not difficult to ob
tain the top quotation for fancy Black. The
canners bought common white at 2@3c and
secured some Royal Anne at 5%c.
and prices were generally lower. As usual some
poor Strawberries were received and were eold
below the : quotations. Strawberries in . crates
from Florin were in good condition and sold
promptly. Other' Berries in crates were most
ly poor and sold slowly. Prices on Currants
had a | wider range, as some of the receipts
came to hand overripe and leaking.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
A short time ago the Secretary of the
Treasury inaugurated- a new system of
handling samples of the teas shipped
through this port from the Orient. Hith
erto it had been the practice for the tea
examiner to select the samples out of the
packages and have them sent to the Ap
praiser's store. Under the new regulation
the importer or consignee is obliged to
select the samples.: This entails consid
erable labor and time, and in consequence
all the tea firms in the city have pro
tested against the new order of things,
and have prepared a petition requesting
the Secretary of the .Treasury to restore
the old regulation. Collector Stratton and
Appraiser Dare have recommended a re
turn to the old system.
Tea Importers Dissatisfied.

NECK OF MINER
Cool CouesÂ»1 Averts a
Lynching in Shasta
County.
Men of Kennett Attempt to
Summarily Punish a
Wife-Beater.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING. June 9.â That there was not'
a lynching at the Shasta King mine of
the Trinity Copper Company, near Ken
nett, on Saturday afternoon was due less
to the tearful appeals of the victim than
to the sober intercession at a critical mo
ment of men whose advice was listened
to. by the half-frantic mob of miners. The
man who almost paid the death penalty
for his inhuman cruelty was a wife
beater. . Â¦- Â¦-.-Â¦;Â»;..
Some months ago a. miner named Fidler
went to the Shasta King to work. He was
accompanied by his wife and his 10-year
old daughter. They occupied a cabin near
the mouth of the main tunnel. Occasion
ally Fidler has been getting intoxicated,
and when in that condition he was said
to be very abusive to his wife and daugh
ter. Fidler was intoxicated on Saturday
when he went to his home. His wife and
daughter were heard to cry out, and pres
ently the little girl ran out screaming.
Her face was bleeding where the brutal
father had struck her. Fidler was then
engaged In inflicting punishment upon
his wife. He Is said to have beaten and
bruised her severely.
Word was passed up to the mine and a
crowd of Infuriated miners gathered. A
miner who is in Redding to-night declares
that the mob booted the brutal husband
into his sober senses and then some onÂ»
produced a rope. A slip noose was made,
thrown over Fldler's head and drawn,
snug about his throat. He prayed ana
begged to be spared.
Two or three cool-headed men came
upon the scene at this moment and so
earnestly counseled the leaders to hesitate
that they finally let the trembling miner
go with a threat. He probably will get
out of the county.

molishing a tower and rendering: several
spectators and graduates unconscious.
The building was soon anre and the lives
of many people were in peril. A largo
tank of water afforded prompt and effect
ive means of extinguishing the flames.
It Is believed no deaths will result, al
though several women were removed from
the church to their homes, suffering se

ed to the fact that thousands of dollars
had^ passed through his hands, and that
he had never been short a cent.
The Commissioners took the â¢ matter
Tinder advisement and will render a de

Leviiigs was cross-examined by Com
missioners Xewhall, Mahoney and Hut

the purpose of provlig that Mrs. Darline

witnesses called, could not remember on
j-hat evening he had seen I*vta|Â£r at the

Levings stated that he replied. "If you
think you can put up a bluff on me your
are very much mistaken. I don't want to
talk to you people any longer and I wish
you good evening."
He then went out to Ellis street and
took the first car to the Hall of Justice
and told the Chief of Police the whole
Levings then said that he saw a shadow
on the door and became suspicious that
some one was putting up a Job on him.
Very soon the door opened and two men
named Douglas and Klemmer entered
end told Levings that they guessed he'd
better be good, that Crothers was a friend
of theirs and that by fair means or foul
they would clear their man, and that if
he didn't let go of the case, they would
break him, that they had heard all that
had been said and that they guessed they
had eot him now.
Mrs. Darling told him that she had tele
graphed to Johnnie's (meaning Crothers')
mother, and that she would advance one
hundred and fifty dollars to help him out.
Witness went on to tell that he informed
Mrs. Darling that he could not do any
thing, and asserted that Mrs. Darling
kept on repeating the one hundred and
fifty dollars proposition in a loud voice,
â¢while he replied in a low voice that he
could have nothing whatever to do with
On Tuesday morning, Levings went on
to say, he received a note to call up East
821 and on doing so discovered that Mrs.
Darling was at the other end of the line
and wished him to come up at once in re
gard to the Crothers case, and as it was
impossible to go to her house at that time
he said he would try and see her that
evening. Witness testified he arrived at
Mrs. Darlingr's house, 913 Eddy street, at
8:2U p. in. and asked her what she wanted
to see him about.
Levinss then carried his case up to
Monday evening, May 5, when he went to
the bowling alley at 56 Ellis street to wait
tor the Tngn, Fstz James, who was sup
posed to have been with Crothers in 'gain
ing possession of the cigars. Levings as
serted that he remained outside for half
an hour and then went inside and bowled
until 10:33 o'clock. . .

On Monday Levings stated that he saw
T. L. Fitzpatrick, the warrant and bond
clerk, and asked him what charge should
be placed against Crothers,' whether it
should be obtaining goods by . false'- pre
tenses or grand larceny. Later Levinga
had an audience with the Chief of Police
and asked him the same question and re
ceived the reply that it should be grand
larceny. â
Levings stated that en Saturday, May 3,.
he was employed during' the whole day in
making out and serving warrants on six
druggists for selling opium. He said he
had discovered that Crothera had been in
trouble before and on Saturday night had
informed the Chief of Police that he had
Crothers' room located.
He then told of how, on May 6, he had
been detailed to arrest a man who had
6toien some cigars from Messrs. Gunst &
Co., on the northwest corner of Eddy and
Inrkin streets: how he . had 'arrested J.
E. Crothers. alias Me Williams, and taken
him to the Hall of Justice and. had his

As It was expected that several Eastern
crooks would take a trip to this city to
try their luck with the Shriners, Captain
Martin put his men to watching all the"
Incoming trains. So far none of the crodk
fraternity from the East has been dis
covered, but the watch will be kept up
till all the trains with the Shriners arrive.
It was not long before Detectives Crock
ett and RIordan brought in Charles Gagus

men, and locked them up in the tanks.
Later Harry Walters and "Dick" Wilson
were brought in.

Lyons testified in his own behalf that
Conway on March 22 called upon him at
the County Clerk's office and asked him
to cash the order at the treasury as ,a
matter of convenience to a friend. Lyons,
on observing that the order was made
payable to. him, asked Conway for an ex
planation, and- Conway replied that as
Lyons was known to Cashier Perkins the
money would be promptly paid, but if
Cc'nway presented the order with hi3 own
name Perkins would think he was "graft
ing."*. In the. full, confidence that the of
der was genuine : and the transaction reg
ular Lyons presented: the order, received
the $250 and paid' if over to Conway in
Iront of Judge Graham's court. The in
ciaent passed out of his mind till Evans
called upon him on May 27 and asked him
v, hy he had withdrawn the bail money.
In cross-examination Lyons said he had
never spoken to Conway about the mat
ter till the night of May 27, when he met
him in a saloon at-Halght and Fillmore
streets with County Clerk Mahony and
others. At that time Conway showed a
Â¦receipt without- date from-Evans for the
$2M and remarked that it made him all
right. Lyons asked Conway why the re
ceipt had been made out in his name, and
Conway did â¢ not reply. He had known
Conway for five or six years and had
every, confidence in him. ,
The Judge, in dismissing the case, re
viewed the testimony and said that In
view of the testimony of Mr. Perkins that
it was customary for some of the Judges
to make their treasury . orders, payable
to persons other than the persons deposit-
ing the money there was nothing in the
mere circumstance of Lyons' name being
mentioned as the payee in the order calcu
lated to. even arouse Lyons' suspicion that
the transaction was irregular, much less
criminal. The Judge added that he had
little, if any, sympathy for Lyons in his
present dilemma, as he had admittedly
suffered his complaisant disposition arid
desire to accommodate Conway to impli
cate him in an embarrassing way in a
seemingly -crooked transaction. Whether
Errand larceny was the proper charge
against Conway and Lyons was a mat
ter, tn his judgment, worthy of serious
consideration, but he was not prepared at
that time to pass definitely upon It.
Cohway's case was continued till Fri
day. â¢
The charge against Robert E. Lyons,
who was charged, in conjunction with
Frederick B. Conway" with grand lar
ceny by trick and device in withdrawing
from the- city treasury $250 bail money
deposited in the name of.J. M. Evans for
the release of Jessie Holland, was dis
missed by Judge Cabanlss yesterday.

1 f-nrsaRELAWNY OF THE' Â¦-WELLS"
1 did as well and much better' than
I most comedies to introduce . the
JJL Henry Miller and Margaret An
glin season at the Columbia Thea
ter last night. Not that it mattered par
ticularly what among the always good
things that Mr. Miller- offers was ciiosen.
Every one was there, and would have
been whatever the play, to welcome these
high favorites of the local stage, Pecu
liarly our own are Mr. Miller 'and "Miss
Anglln, and they bring with.them a_c6m- ;
pany that has not been, equaled in ac
complishment sinceâ it is hard to ... say
when. Stars were simply dotted all over
the cast ot "Trelawhy," with players' of
fame fat enough to stock a half-dozen of
the ordinary } actor taking care of "Me
lud, the carriage waits," â¢ and the like.
Mr. Miller, in small- type somerhalf-way
down the programme, has a'consplduous
ly and characteristically modest role; as a
frayed But happy actor. ', .
Margaret Anglin has more to'do," indeed
a part that fits and . delights as Rose
Trelawny â "Trelawny of the Wells"â yet
not a part that demands more than a
tithe of her power. There is no star role
in the play, but an altogether comfortable
balance of the many bright parts, and a
finish and style to the performance of
each that promise everything desirable
for the coming season'. Unchecked enthu
siasm reigned during the evening, each
familiar face â Mr. Miller, . Miss Anglin,
Charles Walcot, Mrs. Whiffen, Lillian
Thurgate, Ethel Homick, pretty Grace
EUlston, as a housemaid, with a smudge
on her face, William Courtleigh and many
othersâ receiving a personal greeting: - .
"Trelawny of the Wells" â bids fair to
become a favorite among comedies here
to judge by Its reception last night. Per
haps Finero has done better things, but
the play is bright, amusing and an-ex
cellent evening's entertainment. '
The dramatis personae are mostly act
ors, of the early sixties, before the (Strut
and tear of the hair had gone the way/of
all things mortal. Its hero Is. supposed
to be the late Tom Robertson, . who intro
duced the art of being natural among the
ranting Thespians, In the play Tom
Wrench, done by Mr. Miller. The "Wells"
is Sadler's Wells, a playhouse of .ancient
fame in London, and "Trelawny". Is Miss
Rose Trelawny, sometime leading lady 'of
the same. The first act Introduces Tre
lawny bidding farewell to her former as
sociates, and on her way to the ancestral
home of her aristocrat lover where she Is
to be taken f for a month "on approval''
by his distinguished but .- dull ; relatives:
Very amusingly has Mr. Pinero pictured
the goodnatured players, their little Jeal
ousies, loudness, grandiloquence, the ex
igencies of the hoop skirt -also contribut
ing not a little to. the fun of the scene.
The next act opens In Cavendish Square.
Sir William Gower (done to complete con
viction by Mr. Walcot) the Â¦ tyrannical
grandparent of Trelawny's lover, and
his formidable sister, are napping under
protecting newspapers, with the lovers
and two other subdued inhabitants hold
ing their breath' in '.fear of arousing the
sleepers. Bad - as' : things are in this
"dreadful after dinner' hour," they â¢ are
worse when Rose, -roused to, audibility by
some lines she recites,*' wakens the gor
gons. And from bad It goes on to worse
The climax Js; reached .wiien. Miss Tre
lawny, in a fit of desperate defiance
caused by- being told not to play the
piano when Sir William is at his rubber
not to sit on the floor, not to sneeze in
vites some of her former friends to the
house after the too respectable household
has retired and is discovered in the midst
of what might be called now a "high old
time." Of course it comes right in- the
end,, with some -ingenious complications
by the way.
Miss Anglin, though suffering from a
cold, was all her charming self as Rose
Trelawny, with the grace of high com
edy that none better than she knows how
to give. Mr. Miller Is much In the back
ground as Tom Wrench, but- has stamped
his small opportunity with all the peculiar
strength that Is his. Mr. Walcot la - ex
cellent as Sir William Gower, and Wii
11am Courtleigh, Fred Thorne and Arthur
Elliot, give a brilliant little gallery of
actor portraits. Lawrence d'Orsay and
Charles Gotthold are also â¢ valuable in
their places. Lillian Thurgate has a " de
lightful sketch of Avonla Bunn, and Mrs.
Walcot, Mrs. Whiffen and Miss Homick
are respectively, all .their. parts allow. It
Â¦was a brilliant performance, and' one can
sit back comfortably and wait with cer
tain pleasure for the coming bljls of what
promises' to be < a most- notable season.

cleverness she displays In imitating an

solve. IMurphy and Slater, colored sing

The Danger Period for Gtc

Y Nigh-
"In 1S99 I was compelled to abandon my
profession because cf nervous prostration
consequent upon exposure, hard study,
and overwork. A number of physicians
declared I would never recover, but I
tried Paine's Celery Compound, and in
less than a year increased in weight from
141% to 215 pounds. During the recent
strike of the Steel "Workers, finding my-
self ready to collapse, and fearing a re-
currence of my former trouble. I returned
to my former friend, Paine's Celery Com-
pound, and already am feeling more vig-
orous and able to meet and discharge tha
duties of my office."
If there Is mental depression. loss of
energy," lack of vivacity, dullness of the
eyes, blanched cheeks and lips, confusion
in the head,' defective memory, love of
solitudeâ all these are direct indications
of coming nervous collapse, and call for
the immediate use of that nerve feeder,
strength giver, and blood enricher, Paine's
Celery Compound. This Heaven-sent pre-
scription is a peerless remedy for your
dangerous troubles. President T. J. Shaf-
fer, of the Amalgamated Association of
Iron. St?el and Tin "Workers of the Uni-
ted States, writes from Pittsburg, Pa., aa
follows:
. This is the time when nervous debility
and nervous prostration begin to manifest
themselves. The comingr hot weather will
only add fuel to the flrc of suffering and
disease. - -
Paine'a Celery Compound has saved
thousands of people from nervous pros-
tration and collapse brought on through
sleeplessness, weakened nerves, and im-
poverished blood. The great medicine has
made thousands well. It has conquered
weakness and ill health when everything
else has failed. :T -. .
