, Supplies are here in plenty for the
present, but great suffering has been
caused by the lack of water. AH the
natural water supplies have been pol
luted by the lava, which has developed
sulphuric acid. Water is beinsr doled out
from the ships, and word has been sent
to nearby islands for a greater supply.
WATER IS Â¦ POLLUTED.
â¢A steam launch from the Cincinnati
picked up iqo persons who were strug
gling in the water and took them to the
Suehet. Scores of others were taken to
the Cincinnati and ,to the Potomac.
The small- boats" of the latter ship were
out constantly, saving many who other
wise "must have been drowned. This
was a work of danger, as the sea was as
rough as if a hurricane was blowing.
Quickly, the streets were filled, and
soldiers and sailors mixed freely with
the citizens, all frightened and witless.
All struggled to get to a place of safety,
they knew not where. They all be
lieved that where they were was the
place of greatest danger. Some cursed
in their frenzy, thinking it was prayes
they were uttering. Others fell on their
knees in I the streets and besought pro
tection from above. Few were able to
restrain from tears. When the panic
subsided a little there was - a jzeneral
scramble. for the mountains or the
water front. When the Potomac start
ed for St. Pierre the French cruiser
Suehet went outside and made a tour of
the island in the opposite direction. She
passed St. Pierre, but had no part in the
work of rescue of the refugees who had
been driven^ to the shore by the storm
from -the volcano. When the two
steamers returned to Fort de .France
they found the panic here even v greater
than when they went away. There had
been a recurrence of the detonation*
and stones had been falling upon the

PANIC OF THE ; PEOPLE.
the terror that ensued was pitiful. The
spectacle was . so' appalling that the
populace could not appreciate the sub
limity of it. . :
Liberal wages , are offered for. . res
cuers to' go out and assist 'those who
have fallen by" the way, but the laborers
are too full of. fear. to be tempted by any
offer. The panic was greatest yesterday
when the/ sun rose, shining faintly
through the haze of ; ashes. : The skies
were filled with rolling and. whirling
clouds that were fieri' red. Many be
lieved that flames were af>out ",to ' fall
upon them, .from 'i the heavens, and

their terrors do not decrease." and they
are as anxious to press on to some safe
place as they" were to get here. All the
roads aredotted with dead ; and many
are reported to be dying, having fallen
from weakness on the way. . , .

St.' Pierre is described by Lieutenant
McCormick' as driven into the , earth.
â¢About half the. city has :, been buried

Thousands have left Fort de* France."
Some have gone into the mountains to
almost certain starvation, preferring
that to the fate that would be theirs if
the lava of Mont. : Pelee:.buried them in
the ruins of the city. : Others have gone
to nearby islands, there to depend upon
the charity of strangers. Every ship .in
the harbor is constantly, visited by .those
who would flee at the, next appearance
of great danger. .Clustered' about the
ships arc small boats. filled with natives,
who beg to. be- taken up. Hundreds,,
finding it impossible to obtain boats to
take them to the ship^,; .have swum out,
risking their lives in the water tofacinc:
the danger which fills them \vlth more
terrible dread. One who took this mode
of escape is Richard Radish, of West
minster Park,'; Manchester, England.
Kadish had been travelinj? through
Venezuela with William R. Grace Jri of
New York, and arrived here a few days
ago. "When the culminating' explosion
came yesterday morning and fear struck
to the heart of every person on the, isl T '
and Kadish .rushed to the shore and
plunged into the water. He succeeded
in moving hisshoes and then 'kicked off
his trousers. Being then little' .weighted
with clothes he struck out for the Brit

nearly a mile off shore with- steam up
and ready. to put to sea. .He reached
the ship. safely,' though much exhausted.

Down upon the ruins of St. Pierre fell
great bowlders, all redhot, that battered

Ashes fell in torrents, and it is now.re

W-^ORT DE FRANCE, Mar
' fig . tinique, May 21.â Another
ffi t day of terror and panic has
JS. - been spent by the people of
Martinique. For six hours
yesterday Fort de France was literally
bombarded, by 'Mont' Pelcc. 'Stones,
many of them incandescent, rained on
this city from the clonds. were
destroyed and rrfeTwere'star'ted in" many"
quarters.. With the stones fell hoi .mud
and . ashes. The air was so filled with
volcanic dust that it was barely possible
to breathe. At times it 'seemed as i{
suffocation must be the fate of all who
could not be taken on board the ships in
the harbor. While the loss of life has
not. been great, the eruption yesterday
was far worse than that of May 8; when
30,000 inhabitants of St. Pierre were de
stroyed. For many hours 1 the. explo
sions were so heavy that it seemed. as if
the island would be shaken from its
foundation.

Hencken said that he went to his room
with the young woman, and that after
Brown came in, he went out. going into
Brown's room, and went to bed. He de
clared further that he heard no disturb
ance in Brown's room, and Is sure. he did
not hear. the â¢ shot that -ended Brown's
life. , - Â¦ :
The police incline to the theory of sui
cide, but will make a thorough investiga
tion.
Thereupon she went to the McAllister
Hotel, Â¦where she : is employed, and on
reaching her room she fainted. On re
viving she told a servant what had oc
curred, and the latter advised her to no
tify the police. She then went out and
finding Patrolman Smith related the oc
currence .to, him.. The. girl was., held
pending further investigation, and Detec
tives were, sent out to find Hencken. The
latter was soon located, and he corrobo
rated the young woman's statement in
most particulars. Hencken said : it was
his room, in which Brown shot himself;
and also stated 'jhat Brown had been
worrying /over financial difficulties. He
said he thought it probable that Brown
had committed suicide.
Shortly after, says Miss Smith, Brown
attempted an assault, but -she repulsed
him. Then Brown started for the door,
saying he would look for Hencken. Th,e
woman then, insisted that she would go
out .to look for Hencken. She left the
room, she declares, and as she'-closed the
door, she says, she heard the sound of a
shot.
Last night. ?ald Miss Smith, she went
out to the- ; Chutes with Hencken. On their
return,, they mct-Brown. and the three
went to the room at.601 McAllister street.
Brown and Hencken became involved in
an altercation, and Hencken finally left
the room.
A rapid examination . showed him that
the man had succumbed to a bullet wound
in the heartl A, revolver lay be
side the body. The patrolman notified the
Central Police. Station,' and the, young
woman was taken there, where she made
a statement of what* she claims to be the
truth of the matter. She said that her

GIFT OF THE KAISER
STOLEN FROM HARVARD
As this dispatch is sent the beating of
drums can be heard on all sides and arm
ed men are gathering for the battle. The
members of the diplomatic corps assem
bled here this morning and decided to
protest against the entrance of the north
ern army into tho capital. Unfortunately
this protest is not likely to have much
effect, as there are no foreign war ves
sels in the harbor. Regret is especially
expressed at the absence of a United
States warship from Port au Prince,
though the Topeka is due here.
The people are very excited and seem
determined to make a vlgoroug resistance
to the entrance of the Army of the North
into this city. The general belief is that
if Firmin persists in his intention to at
tempt to force an entry into Port au
Prince a severe engagement will follow.
PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti. May 21.â
The Army of the North, numbering about
4000 men, commanded by General Firmln,
the most powerful candidate for the
Presidency of Hayti, arrived to-day at
Arcahale, two days' march from here.
The provisional Government has sum
moned all citizens to defend the capital,
and as a result the entire population of
Port an Prince is now under arms.
The conference report on the agricult
ural bill was agreed to. Bacon of Georgia
then resumed his speech begun yesterday
on the Philippine bill. Adverting to the
policy of concentration he referred to the
camps, as â¢ reconcentrado camps, and
SpOoner inquired if. It was his purpose to
fasten upon the American army the odium
of Weylerlsm. He said the term recon
centrado stood for a policy of infamy,
which was not the purpose of General
Bell in issuing the concentration order and
he believed Bacon knew that the general
had no such purpose. â¢ â¢- - . Â¦ .
Bacon said he had^ called attention "to
this matter simply to show the American
people what were the results of the Phil
ippine policy in. order that, understanding
it, they might be induced to abandon* it.
Discussing the term "scuttle," as applied
.to the Philippine policy, he declared that
what tho minority , now, asked to be done
as to the Philippines "was .precisely what
leading Senators of the majority wanted
to be done In the beginning, and after
quoting from speeches of Lodge arid For
aker, Bacon said: .
"If , these Senators .will say to us that
it is the purpose of the United States to
let these people stand alone and ultimate
ly to give them freedom, we will not quar
rel then about the time. , What we want
to know is that this excrescence is to bo
cut off from our body politic."
Fairbanks called up the omnibus, public
building bill. Several amendments were
adopted. Including an addition of $15 000
for Albuquerque, N. M. As amended the

to state that the / German Government

treaty with the United States to prevent
an outbreak of tariff hostilities such as
the Agrarians are demanding.
Apart from the promise of a glowing
reception the Kaiser wishes to see with
his own eyes the colossal enterprises and
industrial magnitude of the - United
States. The Kaiser sincerely believes
that Germany and tho United States can
obtain more advantageous results by
working together commercially and po
litically than by resorting to tariff war
fare. -â¢.â¢; ;Â£'> â¢
That is the Query one hears on all
sides. Although official affirmation' is
lacking the announcement comes up in
sistently that the Kaiser's next move to
secure a rapprochement with the United
States will be a personal visit to Presi
dent Roosevelt. It is understood that the
trip to the United States was discussed
during his recent trip on board the Kron
prinz Wilheim to the North Sea.
It has always been one of the earnest
wishes of the Kaiser, expressed in pri
vate conversation and to members of the
American Embassy here, that he mignt
some day be able to visit the United
States. Prince Henry's reception Is main
ly responsible for the newly expressed

The Kaiser is known to entertain strong
views on the Santiago controversy. He
speaks of tlie Schley inquiry as the court
mariial of a man who served his country
Â¦well. The testimony of some of Schley's
brother officers in putting the admiral in
the light of a. coward has amazed and
disgusted the whole German navy.
This reversal of precedent In accordance
with which American military and naval
representative:? have hitherto been intro
duced to tile Kaiser by the same channels
as the Embassador is considered in diplo
matic circles here a direct snub that is
)ikeiy to be emphasized throughout
Potts' diplomatic career.
BERLIN, May 2Lâ Because he called
Admiral Schley a coward, Lieutenant
Commander Tempjln M. Potts, recently
appointed naval attache to the United
States embassy in Berlin, has received in
timation that the welcome to be accorded
him by the Kaiser and the German navy
will be limited to diplomatic courtesy. In
answer to the embassy's inquiry as to
Â¦when it would be convenient to present 1
Potts to the Emperor, the German For
eign Office returned the reply that the
matter is in the jurisdiction of the Navy
Department. - I
Special Dispatch to The Call.
For this reason President Palma insists
uppn the lowest possible salaries and the
most rigid economies. If it should bo
absolutely necessary the expenses will be
curtailed or some changes made in the
internal revenue taxes to increase the
revenues. The chief hope lies in the im
mediate negotiation of a reciprocity treaty
with the United States to permit the mar
keting of the island's sugar. The sale of
this product, it is believed, would stim
ulate importations, by distributing money'
and increasing consumption.
'The illumination of this city last night
probably was never surpassed in an
American city. The facades of the hotels
and lines of arches gleamed with electric
lights, Japanese lanterns swung from
trees in the parks, colored lanterns- of
some ancient design glowed above the
door of nearly, ef cry residence and the
driveway leading to the ocean front 'was
roofed with a myriad of multi-colored
globes. The feature of the' fireworks dis
play from the forts across the bay was
an immense Cuban flag and portraits of
President Palma, General Gomez, General
Marti and other Cuban heroes. Significant
of the acquiescence -of the wealthy Span
iards in the new Government was the fact
that a Cuban flag was hoisted over the
casjno by the Side of the banner of Spain.
lhe general festivities were resumed at
aawn to-day, when the buglers sounded
the reveille in all parts of the city and
\ o Dan ds gave their morning concerts.
At 8 o clock the foundation stone of the
triumphal arch commemorating the in
auguration of the Cuban republic was laid
with appropriate exercises on Independ
ence avenue by the Circulo Nacional
This afternoon the theaters were thrown
open and free performances were given

HAVANA, May 21.â The immediate
financial future of Cuba is a matter of
concern, as , the customs receipts* have
fallen off appreciably during the last few
weeks and the aid of the wealthy classes
may be essential to tide Cuba over a
crisis, j Should one come, with the small
surplus turned over to the republic and
the present rate of receipts, against tha
increase in expenditures on account of
Congress and the new salaries,; the treas

People have no idea how
crude and cruel soap can be.
It takes off dirt. So far,
so good; but what else does
it do.
It cuts the skin and frets
the under-skin; makes red-
ness and reughness and
leads to worse. Not soap,
but the alkali in it.
Pears' Soap has no free, al-
kali in it. It neither reddens
nor roughens the skin. It re-
sponds to water instantly; wash-
es and rinses off in a twinkling; is
as gentle as strong; and the
after-effect is every way good.

OP THE
CONDITION AND AFFAIRS
"The soreness has left my stom-
ach entirely and I am free from
indigestion and dyspepsia, and will
say to all who are troubled with
catarrh or stomach trouble of any
kind, don't put it off and suffer, but
begin to take Feruna right away, and
keep it up until you are cured, as
you surety will be if you persevere.
"My wife, as many in the southwest
can say, was troubled with a bad cough
and bronchial trouble, and doctors all
over the country gave her up to die, as
they could do nothing more for her. She
began taking Peruna with the result that
she is better now than she has been In
years, and her cough has almost left her
entirely. The soreness has left her lungs
and she is as well as she ever was in her
life, with thanks, as she says, to Peruna.
Yours very truly, T. P. MOODY."
Catarrh in its various forms is rapidly
becoming a general curse. An undoubt-
ed remedy has been discovered by Dr
Hartman. This remedy has been thor-
oughly tested during the past forty years.
Prominent men have come to know of its
virtues, and are making public utterances
on the subject. To save the country we
must save the people. To save the people
we must protect them from disease. The
disease that is. at once the most prevalent
and stubborn of cure is catarrh.
If one were to make a list of the differ-
ent names that have been applied to ca-
tarrh in different locations and organs
the result would be astonishing. We
have often published a partial list of
these names, and the surprise caused by
the first publication of it to all people,
both professional and non-professional
Was amusing. And yet we have never

also of the Masons. The cut shows Colo-

In a recent letter from 5900 Michigan

the following:
"For over twenty-five years I

ten years I suffered from catarrh of
the stomach terribly.
"I hav3 taken all kinds of medi-
cines and havs been treated by all
kinds of doctors, as thousands of

About the grave stood officers,

made more intense by the knowledge
held by each one present that his own

was fired by the volcano that had
brought destruction upon the Consul.

To-day there is an .alarming report
from a credible source that Enham Moun
tain, near the Marriaquia Valley, an old
and apparently extinct crater, is showing
fciens of activity. This volcano is on'.v
six miles from Kingstown. -
A thick, smoky cloud overspreads the
island, all business is suspended here, the
Ktreots are empty and every one is ter
ror stricken. The feeling' of suspense is
painful. People pass their time gazing at
the northern $ky, where the thunder
clouds gather aiid the mournful roaring
of the volcano is heard.
Kingstown is now congested and the de
irarid on the Government is increasing
rapidly as more and more people are
obliged to leave their homes and business.
The continuous agitation of the volcano
and the absence of rain has caused the
vicinity of the afflicted villages to look
like portions of the desert of Sahara.
The viilagers who had fled to Chauteau
Belair and Georgetown for safety are now
pouring into Kingstown, this being the
farthest town from the Soufriere.
The Royal Mail steamer Wear is bring
ing refugees here from Chateau Belair.
Reports received here from the districts
in the vicinity of the volcano say that
the rumblings of the craters were appall-
Ikj; and that streams of lava were flow
ing down the mountain side.
The inhabitants were frenzied with fear
at the time of the outbreak, dreading a
repetition of the catastrophe which caused
such terrible loss of life on this island.
They ran from the streets into the open
country, crying and praying for preserva
tion from another calamity. No one on
the island of St. Vincent slept that night.
While the worshipers were returning
from church at 3:30 p. m. an alarming
cioud suddenly ascended many miles high
in the north of the island and drifted
sluggishly to the northeast. Incessant
lightning fell on the mountain, and one
etvere flash seemed to strike about three
miles from Kingstown. The thunderous
rumblings in the craters lasted for two
hours and then diminished until they be
came mere murmurings. The remainder
of the night was clear. Ashes fell from
10 o'clock until midnight.
Sunday the adjoining districts
trembled and some of the shocks - were
felt here. Smoke issued from the craters
and ftssiires of the mountain, and the at
mosphere throughout the Island of St.
VJncent was exceedingly hot.

The discovery has caused great uneasi
ness. Thus far no one has undertaken
to explore the cave, but an investigation
will be made. Some are of the opinion
that it is an old mining drift, but nor^s
of the pioneers can recall any work being
done in that vicinity. There is naturally
great anxiety as to what an investigation
will disclose concerning the under-surface
foundations of the city.
An examination was. made and it was
found that the opening in the, street was
about eighteen' inches ,ih diameter. It
went down into an inky blackness. A
lantern was procured and, lowered into
the cave. About twenty feet of rope was
let out and the lantern swung free each
way. The light showed that there was
a long tunnel or passage running length
wise of the street. It was quite dry and
looked as though it had once been the
bed of a stream. The crust which covered
this cavern was only eight inches thick
and heavy teams had passed over it but
a few minutes previously.

When the two boxers signed articles it
was agreed the referee should be appoint
ed one week before the contest, which is
scheduled to be decided at Woodward's
Pavilion one week from to-night. If they
do not select a referee before midnieht
to-night it will fall to tne lot of Alex.
Greggains of the Sail Francisco Athletic
Club, under whose a*uspices the contest
will be brought off, to name the referee.
Both principals are training faithfully
for the bout. Lavigne is working hard
at the Six Mile House under the direction
of Mark Shaugnessy and Canadian Frank,
while Britt is putting the finishing touches
to his training over at Croll's Gardens.
His trainers. Spider Kelly and Charles
Reno, say their man Is in better shape
than he has ever been in his life except
for an injured foot, which he bruised sev
eral days ago on the road.
Britt's brother, who performs the same
offices for Jimmy as Billy Lavigne does
for the sturdy Saginaw lad, entered Â£.1
objection to the selection of anybody from
any of the neighboring towns on the
grdund that there was plenty of local ma
terial to choose from. And thus the mat
ter stands.
Phil Wand, Eddie Graney, Jim Kennedy.
Young Mitchell, Jimmy McDevitt, Milton
Hayes, Jim McDonald' and several other
men were mentioned as ellgibles for the
place, but Billy Lavigne, who looks after
his brother's business interests, objected
on the ground' that they came either from
south of Market street or from the Olym
pic Club. "1 will entei^a serious objection
to anybody who lives south of Market
street or is a member of the Olympic
Club," said Billy Lavigne while the ar
gument was going on. "Not that any of
the men mentioned are not good, honest
sportsmen, but I want a referee who has
absolutely no chance to be influenced by
neighborly friendship. Everybody know3
that Britt is extremely popular south
of-the-slot and in the Olympic Club, and
I won't stand for a referee from either
place."
The respective managers of boxers Kid
Lavlgne and Jimmy Britt are haggling
over the referee question. Thev met last
night at Harry Corbett's and considered
several names, . but after a consultation
that lasted over an hour they left the
place without selecting the man who will
officiate as the third man in the ring.

SUMMARY.
WASHINGTON, May 21.â Arthur E.
Duffey, the world's . amateur champion
sprinter, and A. M. Thompson, graduate
manager of athletics at Georgetown, will
sail for England on June 16. At Wolver
ton Duffy will enter the coronation sports
set for June 28. He will then compete in
England Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
Duffey Will Race in Europe.
CHICAGO, May 21. â Tommy Burns, ac
cording to rumor from reliable sources,
will have the mount on Lucky Baldwin's
Cruzados in the American Derby. Cru
zados will be set down for his real work
for the American Derby early in the com
ing week, and the general public
will then begin to learn something definite
of the way the present favorite in the
winter book will shape up for the great
event on Saturday, June 21. The colt has
fully recovered from the long journey
from Los Angeles. So far the change in
climate, food and water seems to agree
with him. Escalante, a second Derby
choice of Lucky Baldwin's string, on
which Ransom will have the mount, is in
quite as good condition as his stable com
panion. Wise ones say he will surprise
those who overlook him in the Derby
event.
Tommy Burns "Will Bide Cruzados.
. When the party was about to separate
"Kitz" addressed Delaney, saying he had
no feeling over what had passed between
them In recent months and asked Delaney
to shake hands, which they did.
After a brief discussion "Fitz" said:
"I'll tell you what I'll do, 'Jeff;' I'll leave
the naming of the club to you. I know
you're on the ball and I have no prefer
ence." .... ,
Jeffries said: "I'll make it the San
Francisco Athletic Club. That club: has
the sanction for July and is responsible."
Some* discussion ensued as to forfeit
meney. Jeffries produced a 'wad of bills
of startling proportions, which he wanted
to post at once. As "Fitz" has $2500 up
in New York, it was decided to put up all
the forfeits at the meeting to-morrow
afternoon. Sam Thall will be the final
stakeholder.
The question of referee was quickly set
tled. Harrv Corbett's name was first
suggested, but he positively refused to
act. Delaney suggested Jack Welch and
"Fitz" came back with the names of L.
R; Fulda and Eddie Graney,
"Graney suits us," said Delaney, and
he was chosen. ' .â¢Â¦â¢
"Fitz" and Jeffries shook hands over the
selection of the referee.
CHOOSING THE CLUB:
Before the bids were opened "Fitz"
broached the subject of soft bandages.
Jeffries quickly withdrew his opposition
and the matter was settled before those
in attendance realized it. Some extended
discussion was expected on this point.
There was a bewildering array of bids.
Before Mr. South commenced to read them
Jim Neill asked if the fight would go to
the highest bidder. Billy Delaney ex
plained it would go to the highest respon
sible bidder. ' , _
The first bid opened was from the Cen
tury Athletic Club, which offered 75 per
cent of the groÂ«s receipts, any money re
ceived from pictures to go to the fighters.
The Arcade Athletic Club of Oakland
offered 80 per cent; Bay City Athletic
Club, 80 per cent; Century Athletic Club,
Los Angeles, 80 per cent; Empire Athletic
Club, 75 per cent; Yosemite Athletic Club,
G6 2-3 per cent; Berkeley Athletic Club
(unidentified). 90 per cent; San Francisco
Athletic Club, 70 per cent. The latter bid
was in the form of a concise statement
of the boxing situation in this city. It
also recited the fact that the bid was the
largest any club could afford to offer if
it hoped to handle the fight properly.
Some of the club representatives then
explained their bids. "Fitz" proposed
that he and Jeffries retire and have a
talk over the bids. The fighters with
their representatives and the newspaper
men* then retired to an adjoining room.
The opening of the .bids was a ceremo
nious proceeding. In the center, of the
room was a table, on one side of which sat
"Fitz," supported by Clark Ball and Tom
Wilson. Jeffries sat opposite with Billy
Delaney on his left and Kid Eagan on his
right. Grouped about the room were many
well known sporting men. On one side
sat Harry Corbetf, Colonel Brady, Jack
Welch and Alex Greggains, while opposite
them were Phil Wand, Eugene Van Court,
Eddie Graney and lesser lights.
BEWILDERING ABBAY OF BIDS.
When the. boxers commenced to discuss
Ihe bids it, was found the San' Francisco
Club was in line to receive the permit for
July. The men â¢ want to fight in this
month, hence their acceptance of the
club's offer. . ' . .
Jeffries withdrew his objection to soft
surgical bandages. Eddie - Graney was
chosen referee. The fighters will receive
70 per cent of the gross receipts. Of this
the winner will receive 60 per cent and the
loser 40 per cent. - Â¦
James- J. Jeffries will defend his title
to the heavyweight boxing championship
of tho world in this city early in July.
The champion met Fitzsimmons yester
day afternoon in the Central Theater and
the boxers acting in harmony the de
tails of the big fight were quickly ar
ranged. It will be handled by the San
Francisco Athletic Club, of â¢ which -Alex
Greggalns Is president. The date was not
determined upon,- that detail, being left
for decision until Â¦Â» to-morrow afternoon,
when the men. will meet again to sign the
articles which, will be prepared in the
meantime. ' ..

OAKLAND.
In the sixteenth Unglaub hit out a
single to left field and was safe at sec
ond 'on Schmidt's error of Wagner's bunt.
He scored on Thomas' little single into
left territory. Oakland tied the score in
Its half of the same round on Schmidt's
single to left, Wagner's fumble of the ball.
Walters' sacrifice and TJnglaub's error of
Mohler's short drive. Xeither side was
able to score after this. Umpire McDon
ald called the game at the end of the
nineteenth inning, with the score four all
and the clock saying 7:35.
McCreedie was not feeling well and re
tired in the seventh in favor of Dr. Mosk
iman, whom Pete Lobman batted for In
the nineteenth. Francks took fifteen
chances at short without the slightest
kind of an error. Old Truck Eagan crack
ed out a long three-cushion swipe in the
thirteenth, when only one was out, and
etill he could not reach home. Dunleavy
had ten chances in left field and accept
ed them all, while Unglaub managed to
pile up five miscues in his beat around
short- The score:
It was a great pitchers' battle from the
Sfth round till the grand finish. Neither
tide could score, though both had. men
Â«n bases and were not without chances,
fiacramemo's Jnfleld was unsteady and
Â»nade numerous bad errors. Â¦ Strange to
say only one of them was responsible for
the runs scored. \
The sixteenth inning rolled around and
society swells began to arrive rn dress
suits. Working men, finished with the
day's bitter toil, came without dress suits.
People all over Oakland heard about the
fun and hied themselves hither In the
hope of seeing some excitement. They
Â¦were not disappointed, for they had the
pleasure of beholding five or six extra
rounds.
The third brought two to the Ewing
camp on hits by Francks and Strieb and
l he score read three all in the fifth, when
Ctreib's hot two-cushioner brought the
flat-hoofed llohler in from first. ,
The next round brought forth another
Senatorial tally, Thomas butting in from
third on the thro,w of Sheehan's fly from
left field. Thomas, in fact, did not run
at all, claiming Dunleavy held him at
third, which claim McDonald upheld.
Tliis made the score board three to
nothing, with the Senators still holding
onto the bulky end.
Devereaux spoiled Oakland's chances
in the opening fusillade. Doyle was an
Â«asy out, but Cristall got a whack in the
solar plexus and took first. He went to
third on Mohler's error of Sheehan's drive.
Shee ban. immediately pilfered the middle
cushion. The next man was duck soup
for that infield of Ewing*s, but Wagner
hit an easy onÂ© to Devereaux. Brick
seemed to be thinking of home and
mother or old times at Casey's Cafe. In
stead of simply touching the third sta-
Tion and forcing Sheehan, who was tear
ing from second, he threw over Streib's
head and both Hulen and Sheehan scored.
The stonewall Infield of the Oakland
team did phenomenal stunts and cut off
a Senatorial victory on five occasions.
The Senators managed, to get the bags
crowded In the fifteenth round and only
one man out. Unglaub hit a hard ground
er to Francks, who touched second and
threw to Streib, completing a neat double
play and prolonging the agony, all of
which set the big crowd on the verge of
hysterics.
The Senators owe their great showing
"entirely to the remarkable pitching of
young Thomas. He twirled a masterly
game throughout, showing remarkable
headwork and control. He mixed up his
curves and shoots in euch a manner as
to mystify the Oakland batsmen in every
inning but three, when they succeeded in
landing on him for four runs. The total
amount of hits accumulated by the Bwing
bunch was but six in the nineteen
rounds of play.
Cristall, the clever southpaw, started In
to mix the dope for Ewing, but was wild
and ineffective owing to the coldness of
the weather. He retired in the middle of
the second inning. Brick Devereaux went
Into the box to finish out the inning,
Dunleavy coming in to third base and
Cristall going out to try his fortune in
the left patch.
The contest could hardly go down on
.the history page under the heading of
high grade ball. It was sensational at
times and In spots was slow enough to
rival the proverbial wagon that Is made
lor hauling Ice. There was ball of al
most every kind mixed Into those nine
teen agonizing spasms. Both Fisher and
Ewlng then took off their bonnets and
bowed, to each other, saying: "I hope we
will have one more chance to settle the
difficulty, for we both are about It."
Oakland and Sacramento played ball till
the stars began to twinkle and .the moon
to shed Its silvery rays upon the diamond
yesterday at the Oakland grounds. It was
the longest game ever played upon a
California diamond and one of tho five
longest In the history of the great na
tional pastime.

tremely large. This year's picnic
was held yesterday. Fully 20,000 people
journeyed across the bay to see the races
at the Emeryville track given by the
"knights of the cleaver" and to enjoy
dancing and other Dastimes in the park.
Every train brought its share. The day
was ideal.
The races created a deal- of excitement.
The betting was very lively. Some very
fine horses were entered and the .various
heats were closely contested.
Over at Shell Mound Park there was a
scene of revelry. The place was filled
with guests. The pavilion was so crowded
that a dancer had his hands full piloting
his fair partner about the hall. A band
played enlivening dance music while the
guests picked their way over the slippery
floor. \ The crowd was a good-natured one
and no one complained If his corns were
stepped on as he knew he would probably
be performing the same trick on some
one else.
The picnic was an orderly one.< Few if
any fistic disputes were held and these
were suppressed in quick order and the
disputants put off the grounds.
At the racecourse hundreds sat in the
warm sunshine and watched the sport.
There were races for the old and young,
fat and lean. Children danced for prizes
and young men caroled their best for the

A Relative or Friend to Pass Into
the Dark Valley Simply Because
the Doctor Desires to Cling
to Medical Etiquette ?
WILL YOU ALLOW
The months just passed of the present
year have brought bereavement and dark
clouds of sorrow to many homes In our
land. Fathers, mothers, sisters, and
brothers have been forever removed by
the grim reaper, death.. The large ma-
jority of such could have been saved had
their friends given them Paine's Celery^
Compound, instead of the worthless mediÂ»Â»
cines the sick ones were forced to swal-
low.
In many families a too slavi â¢"Â» obedience
to medical dictation kept ti-j true life
saver from the sick and dyin^: ones. Past
records of marvelous cures and victories
wrought by Paine's Celery Compound
were ignored by medical men; in a word,
it was unprofessional in their estimation
to introduce the life giving Compound.
Ah! Remorse is now doing its quiet
but effective work, and those most closely
interested are suffering for their neglect.
Will you, dear reader, allow some dear
relative or friend to pass from life with-
out making an effort to save the perish-
ing one by Paine's Celery Compound?
The virtues and powers of Dr. Phelps*
prescription are wondrously far reaching
and mighty*. Even though your friends
have suffered long, and have come to that
point where the physician, is helpless to
save, even then, there is a blessed hope
if Paine's Celery Compound's used.
The desperate cases cured in the past
and the number of precious lives saved,
ia the bright, the living proof, that
Paine's Celery Compound makes sick peo-
ple well. ____â

T%E CLERK FOR PROBATE
JA. HULL, who Is said to be one
of the cleverest forgers in the
country, was arrested yester-
O day morning by Sergeant Lewis
and Special Officer Charles .Al
den in the office of Marley Hay, repre
sentative cf the Holland Torpedo-boat
Company, at the Union Iron Works. A des
patch from Superintendent Thomas O'Neil
of Chicago sets forth that Hull Is wanted
there for the larceny of $1500 worth of
diamond jewelry from the Juer
gens Jewelry Company. Hull was
employed by Hay under the name,of S.
J. Robinson, but recognized by Special
Officer Alden, who knew him while he
was serving a sentence in San Quentin
prison for forgery. Â»
Hull after his release from San Quen
tin in August, 1897, became acquainted
with President Krueger of the Standard
Wallpaper Company and induced him to
indorse worthless drafts for $325, which
were cashed by the First National Bank.
PAY LAST SAD TRIBUTE
OF RESPECT TO THEIR DEA.D
Hull next turned up in St. Louis, where
he was appointed to the agency of a
bank in Oklahoma. He had trouble with
ay woman and fled from Str*Louls after
srealing a number of drafts, which he
passed In Kansas City, Denver, New Or
leans and Chicago, He was subsequently,
arrested in Chicago on a dispatch from
St. Louis. - He immediately pleaded guilty
to a charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses and was sentenced to one year's
imprisonment.- After his , release he re
turned to Chicago and obtained employ
ment with the Juergens Jewelry Com
pany; from whom, it is now alleged he
stole some diamonds and then fled to this
city. â¢
With the money thus obtained Hull went
to New York, where he became acquaint
ed with a wealthy man, who took him to
London. .From London he went to Paris,
Berlin and Monte Carlo, where, he gam
bled away all hI5 money. He was -sub-'
.sequently arrested in France for obtain
ing money by false pretenses, but was ac
quitted on a technicality.
"CYRANO" OF ROSTAND
BARRED BY A COURT
Chicago Playwright Wins His Case
Against A. M. Palmer and
Richard Mansfield.
CHICAGO, May 21.â Judge C. C. Kohl
saat, in the United States District Court
to-day Issued a perpetual injunction
against the production in the United
States of Edmund Rostand's play "Cy
rano .de Bergerac" in the suit brought
against Richard Mansfield and A. M. Pal
mer by Samuel Eberly Gross of Chicago
The court. In Its order, ruled that Gross
was also entitled to an accounting of the
profits from the play, but Gross waived
this right and accepted $1 as satisfaction.
Gross is the author of a drama entitled
"The Merchant Prince of Cornyille," the
leading character of which was distin
guished by the big nose that made Cy
rano famous. This ; drama, Gross main
tained, was printed for private circula
tion some time before the appearance of
the celebrated French play and according
to expert testimony was the basis of
Rostand's work. In court numerous par.
â¢allels both of action and language were
shown. The most Important of the simi
larities In the two dramas was the woo
ing by proxy of the leading characters in
a. balcony sceneâ made notable in Cyrano
by Mansfield's production. wiÂ«Â«iu

â¢ In behalf of 'the organization of this de
lightful fair. In the interest of its charitable
purposes, for the srood which its success will
accomplish, I welcome you to this reproduction
of all Ireland, to her historic "palaces and her
romantic landmarks. I welcome you as friends
ond as comrades, as fellow- workers and as
fellow men. My friends, all Ireland is now
yours. .
I am glad; to see you here In such force. I
am proud of this demonstration, proud of your
manhood in manifesting your appreciation of
our honored friend and In reciprocating even
in this small degree the friendship which ho
has ever shown 'us and our cause. '
PROUD OF WORKINGMEN'.
This great outpouring of the ranks of labor
Is the opportunity and occasion of a double
tributeâ as a tribute of Interest and of grate
ful retard on the part of all of us toward the
friend who has stood by the cause of labor at
all times and on every occasion, the distin
guished president of this fair, and on my part
a tribute to you, my friends before and my
friends now. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ <
Remember, that I am now, as I was before
I became Mayor, the friend of every honest
and conservative workingman, Â¦ open to hia
every, reasonable suggestion, and that I will
continue to be as far. as lies, in my power the
exponent of the ability and of â¢ thÂ»^ moderation
and conservatism of the masses of our com
mon people.
Fellow Wageworkers, Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is the first great mass-meeting of or
ganized labor which I have had the privilege
of addressing since by your votes and your
active and enthusiastic support I became your
Mayor and the Mayor of all the people of this
fair city.
I have met many of you in your individual,
unions since, and have taken occasion to ex^
press to you my thanks, and now before this
larger aggregation of my fellow wage-earners
I embrace the opportunity of declaring to you
again my sincere apDreciation of - your loyal
devotion before my election and of your warm
and earnest encouragement and confidence
elnce.
Despite the immense crowd all present
enjoyed a delightful time. After the pa
rade disbanded- the visiting bands occu
pied the main bandstand and continued to
render. musical selections while Professor
Allen's band took its station in front of
the academy booth in the gallery. .
After the .bands had played a couple of
selections Mayor Schmitz was introduced,
to the large audience by Michael Casey
and made the following address of wel
come:
MAYOR WELCOMES TTNTONS.
When the unions marched into the build-
Ing the crowd divided, the best it could,
and allowed the men to march once
around. the booths. The line of march led
past the queen's throne and the parade
was reviewed by Queen Rita and her
court. Mayor Schmitz and Grand Marshal
Michael Casey. - "
As far as attractions are concerned last
night was the most notable occasion, of
the fair. Contrary to expectations Gov
ernor Henry T/ Gage, who. had been in
vited to visit the fair, failed to put in
an appearance. As usual he adopted the
course most convenient to himself and
sent his regrets. . .
Three thousand members of. the labor
unions formed in line last night in the
vicinity of Fifth and Market streets and
with fluttering flags and two bands pour
ing forth "sweet music paraded under the
leadership of Grand" Marshal Michael
Casey to the Irish Fair. The unions, as
was anticipated, made a splendid display,
and "union labor night" will long'remain
one of the pleasantest recollections of the
great festival. The Streetcar Employes'
Union, which conducted itself in such a
commendable manner during the recent
strike, was the flower of the parading
unions. It was under the command of its
president, Richard Cornelius; and mus
tered fully 500 men. Mayor Schmitz
marched with the wprklngmen.
Before the procession arrived at the Pa
vilion a great crowd had passed Into the
fair and when the unions added their
numbers - to the throng standing room
could scarcely be obtained anywhere with
in the immense structure. Mechanics'
Pavilion was filled with the greatest
crowd in its existence. t.[. \ â
Underwood of Alabama gave notice of
an amendment embodying an educational
test for immigrants. Kleberg of Texas
opposed the educational test as one likely
to bar immigrants accustomed to manual
labor, which was one of the most de
sirable classes for the development of the
country- Grosvcnor of Ohio opposed the
educational test. He said the crimes com
mitted against the governments of the
worlÂ«i.for the past century by reason, of
removing the rulers of those governments
were committed by educated men. Robin
son of Indiana made a plea for a better
condition of affairs in the Indian Terri
tory, a condition which, he said, was a
blot on the escutcheon of the republic
The House then, at 5 o'clock, adjourned.
"Just as you seek to detect a bad wo
man â by asking questions," answered
Shattuc.
To Watson's inquiry as to why an edu
cational test was not provided Shattuc
urged that that had better come in as
an independent measure. Barthold of
Missouri asked how anarchists would be
detected as such.
In explaining the exclusion section Shat
tuc said it embraced, besides paupers, in
sane persons, etc., the following: Polyg
amists, anarchists or persons who believe
in or advocate the overthrow by force or
violence of all government or of all forms
of law or the assassination of public of
ficials; prostitutes and persons who pro
cure or attempt to bring in prostitutes or
women for the purpose of prostitution;
persons whose immigration to the United
States has been Induced by offers,"*solici
tatiens, promises of agreements, promise"
of labor or work <jr service of any kind
in the United States, and also any person
whose ticket or passage is paid for with
the money of -another, or who Is assisted
by others to come.
The immigration laws of this country are
flajrrantly violated. Those Qanadian steamship
agencies in Europe do not hesitate tp adver
tise openly and guarantee to their passengers
that they shall be safely delivered into the
United States and no questions asked, if they
will only take passage via Canada. It can be
proven that one of the Canadian railways i3
in the Chinese passenger traffic regularly and
ie assisting the smugglers by stopping its pas
senger trains several miles outside of a cer
tain city and discharging the Chinese in the
country where wagons, built especially for the
purpose, take whole gangs over the border un
der cover of night and in this way thousands
of Chinese enter the United States annually.
This open discrimination in favor of Canadian
steamship companies and Canadian railroads,
as against our own railroads and steamships,
landing at our shores, should not be longer per
mitted, i.
There has arisen a demand, growing more
and more insistent, that restrictive measures
should be enacted to regulate the 1 influx, and
Fift the quality of the incoming aliens. The
testimony *s overwhelming as to the volume
of undesirable Immigration now being admit
ted. The demand for effective restriction is
universal and imperative.
Shattuc opened the debate with a speech
elaborately presenting the various immi
gration problems and explaining the cor
rective purposes of this bill. In part he
said:
Watson of Alabama gave notice of an
amendment to provide for an educational
test and much of the discussion of the day
was on this subject. â¢
The House earlier In. the day settled
three contested election cases in favor of
sitting members and passed a number of
bills of minor importance.
WASHINGTON, May 2Lâ The House
began consideration of the immigration
bill to-day. The principal speech was
made by Shattuc of* Ohio, chairman of
the Committee on Immigration. He was
especially severe in his condemnation of
the manner In â¢ which immigrants are
shipped through Canada by Canadian
railway and steamship "companies.
The national convention of hcrseshoers
unions resumed business with a large at
tendance yesterday. During the morninjr
the delegates paid a visit to the United
States Mint and in the afternoon the re
port of Ready Kenehan, editor of the In
ternational Union of Journeymen Horse
fhoers' Magazine, was considered. L^st
evening the delegates took a streetcar
rice about the city. A trip on the bay

it .was reported last night that many
of the unions affiliated with the Building
Trades Council were contemplating mak
ing a break to free themselves from the
domination of P. H. McCarthy and his
corps of lieutenants. The Journeymen
plumbers' and steam and gas fitters'
union met last night and considered the
mutter of withdrawing from the council
entirely. Although the step was. not
taken it was learned that the movement
had many advocates in the union and
that if some ether union takes the initia
tive the plumbers will â¢walk out in a
body.
The builders aeclare that the existing
troubles are doing immense damage to
the building interests, ilore than fifty
large buildings, the erection of which was
about to be oegun are being delayed on
account of the uncertainty of the labor
market at the present time. Capitalists
who contemplated putting up buildings
are abandoning the idea because they will
take no chances of tying up big money in
incoixipleted structures. Meanwhile the
Â¦si'orkitigmen themselves are forced to lose
time and money because of the differ
ences existing between the McCarthy fac
tion and the brotherhood.
The builders point out in their, com
munication that the building interests of
the city are suffering greatly by reason of
the unreasonable strife going on
between factions which ought of"
right to be working â¢ in harmony
together. and that the incessant
stoppage of work because of the
calling out of men will result in great
loss, not only to the builders, but to the
vrorkingmon themselves. The unions are
asked to allow men to work with any
carpenter wno has a union card and thus
assist in restoring peace, the theory be
ing that so long as the carpenters are
union men it makes little difference
whether they are affiliated with a locar
or national organization.
The troubles existing between the
Building Trades Council and the Broth
erhood of Carpenters and Joiners have
have been made the subject of an appeal
addressed to all the trades unions by the
Builders' Protective Association. In this
appeal the builders request ail affiliated
unions to remain neutral in the fight now
being: waged.

Women have chosen strange careers for
themselves in various parts of the world.
For Instance, in Georgia, a woman not
only personally delivers mail over a forty
mile route, riding over a scantily settled
region thrice weekly during the year, but
manages a large farm as well, doing
much of the manual labor, such as
plowing, harrowing, sowing and har
vesting, and supports by her energy and
courage a family of four. A short dis
tance from Savannah resides a widow
who has for the last two years madd
more than a comfortable income as a
Government contractor, bidding for the
removal of wrecks, anchoring of buoys,
building of Jetties and dredging. The.
New London Northern Railway employs
the only woman train dispatcher In the
world. Her responsibility is great, her

The fact cannot be too often repeated that the
bosses see to it that their men are registered and
that they, go to the pells on election day. The San
Jose boss was defeated not because any of his old
following deserted him, for it is said his total poll
was .but forty short of what it- was in the previous
election when he won a sweeping victory. The de
feat was caused by the fact that the opponents of
bossism performed their political duty. The issue
before them is .therefore quite plain. So long as they
FROM the city election in San Jose there is to
be derived more than one lesson. It furnishes
not only an illustration of what can be accom
plished by a resolute people against the bosses
backed by Gage and Billy Herrin, but it also em
phasizes the need of registration on the part of all
good citizens. The total registration in San Jose
was slightly over 4800, and in the election 4518 votes
wefc cast. The plurality of the citizens' candidate
was but 322. It will be perceived that had any con
siderable number of good citizens neglected to regis
ter or to go to the polls the bosses would have at
tained a triumph instead of being overwhelmed in
defeat.

A LESSON PROM SAN JOSE.

swallowed up by the sea. Fearful as is this possi
bility, there may be some of us selfish enough to
suggest that a few islands perhaps in the Pacific
might share the same fate.

What would be the salaries of this host of employes?
The amendment says; "The Legislature may from
time to time in its discretion regulate the salaries of
all clerks and employes, but, failing so to do, the
commission shall have the power to fix the same."
It is plain that it would be to the advantage of both
the Legislature and the commission to make the sala
ries large ns well as numerous. As the Commission
ers would be likely to distribute patronage where it
would do mest good, the legislators who received it
would be naturally desirous to make it worth some
thing. If they were .'Jraid to fix the. salaries as high
ns desired, they would have simply to decline to act,
ind then the Commissioners could fix /hem.
Bear in mind that this is but one of the many
evil' features cf the smendment The corporations
are working for big things this time. Is it any won
der they should stand by Gage or that Gage should
It is hardly necessary to point out that a commis
sion clothtd with so wide an appointing power and
working in harmony with the great corporations
could well nigh dominate the politics of the State.
It would have an enormous patronage to distribute
tmong Senators and Assemblymen and a vast num
ber of favors to bestow at the expense of the tax
payers. With such patronage available in every
county and mtsricipality it would have an influence
&1 Sacramento that would enable it to well nigh dic
tate the passage of laws favorable to corporations
and the election of corporation tools to the United
States Senate. *
Having such widespread duties to perform in every
county, the commission will have excuse for enlist
ing a hoide of employes. There are fifty-seven
county Boards of Supervisors in California and up
ward of 100 city or town councils. The commission
would have authority to establish an office and em
ploy agents and clerks in every one of those coun
ties and municipalities, and could have other clerks
and employes to look after the work hitherto done
by Railroad, Bank and Insurance commissions. Fur
thermore, it is to have power to appoint just as many
of these employes as it "may deem necessary," and
"all expenses and salaries shall be paid by the State."
That provision is not portentous on its face, but
when the full scope of the powers of the commission
is considered it will be seen to be per
nicious. The proposed commission is to be clothed
with the powers of the Railroad Commissioners,
Bank Commissioners, Insurance Commissioners, and
so far as dealings- with corporations are concerned it
is to be the successor under the constitution and
laws of the State of Boards of Supervisors and city
and county or city and town councils and other gov
erning bodies of counties and municipalities.
The amendment provides: "The commission shall
have a general office in such place as it may deter
mine- from time to time, and shall appoint such
clerks and employes as it may from time to time
deem necessary, and shall be allowed all necessary
cost of travel in performance of duties, and all ex
penses and salaries in the premises shall be paid by
lhe State."
ONE of the pernicious features of the scheme
embodied in Assembly constitutional amend
ment No. 28, which Gage and the corpora
tion bosses are trying to carry through, is the extra
ordinary power of appointment it confers upon the
commission. We pointed out yesterday that as Gage
would have the appointment of the Commissioners
in the first instance, and as the succeeding members
are to be elected for ten years, there would be one
district in the State whose representative on the
commission would be subject to the popular vote
but once in the next twenty years, another but once
in eighteen years, and a third but once in sixteen
years. As the amendment provides that the act of a
majority of the board is to bt the act of the board,
the three men having the long terms would virtually
be the whole board. We now direct attention to the
appointing powers the three appointees of Gage will
have during their long continuance in office.
THE CORPORATION SCHEME.
.PERSONAL MENTION.
THE entertainment. given by the Cal
edonian Club in Scottish Hall last
night, preparatory to the annual
games at Shell Mound Park on
May 30, was a marked success in
every respect. The hall was crowded to
the doors and many of the audience could
not obtain ..seats. The members of the
club Â¦ wore their new tartan plaids and
bonnets for the first .time. Another pleas
ing feature was the presence of the Brit
ish American Rifles in khaki uniform, un
der command of Lieutenant Birdwood.
Chief A. M. Macpherson presided and
made a few introductory remarks.
The programme was an exceptionally
good one. It consisted of Highland danc
ing in â¢ costume by Frances Dougherty,
Lizzie Ferguson, Elaine Duhem and Vir
ginia Schultz, pupils' of Miss Sibyl Camp
bell; songs by Miss Eleanor Tealing, Miss
Hattie Wilson, Miss L. Cheffers and Miss
Daisy Kean; fencing by Miss Sibyl Camp
bell and. Professor Reid; sword specialties
by Professor Reid; recitation by Miss
Tryphenia Pritchard; Highland fling by
James Trevethick, four and a half years
old; the sword dance by Miss Sibyl.Qamp
bell. and selections on the bagpipes' by
Pipers Lindsay and Ross. Miss -Sibly
Campbell was enthusiastically applauded
for her dancing, as it was full of exquis
ite grace and charm, and the boy met
with an equally enthusiastic reception.
It has been the custom of the advocates of the
Nicaragua' route to belittle the danger of volcanic ac
tion in that part of the world by the assertion that
the Central American volcanoes are exhausted, and
that there is no more reason to fear an eruption from
them than to fear another destructive fire in Chicago
like that which swept the city some years ago. The
outbreak at Pelee puts an end to that easy reassur
ance. That volcano was believed to be as harmless
as either of the three around Lake Nicaragua. At
any rate since' the commercial advantages of one
route are about as good as those of another, and the
cost will be about the same in eachj' it would appear
; nothing more than good common sense to select the
safe route and not put too much trust in volcanoes
.on the supposition that they are not loaded.
A recent review of the contrast between the two
routes in that regard says: 'The isthmus of Pan
ama forms part of an uplift of land, non- volcanic in
origin and running east and west, which antedates in
geologic time the upheaval of the. continental vol
canic rampart of the Andes and the. 'fire circle' of
Central America^ both of which have a general di
rection from north to south. The stability ,of the
isthmian uplift is shown by the fact that it remained
unaffected by the convulsions in which the towering
Andes and the Central American Cordilleras were
evolved. The instability of the region of Lake
Nicaragua, ort the other hand, is made manifest by
the scientifically proven fact that the waters of the
lake once were an arm of the Pacific, though now
raised one hundred feet above the level, of that ocean
and separated from the same- by a chain of moun
tains. Above all is the instability of the region at
tested by the presence of numerous volcanoes."
Experts differ so completely as to the economic
merits of the rival routes that the general mass of
the people have been unable to decide between them.
Seemingly there was about as much to be said on
one side as the other. Such' being the case, the
question of security from volcanic action ought to
be decisive.
It is barely, possible that the new argument may
suffice to put an end to the indecision of Congress on
the subject. Should it be so the country would be
well pleased, for the great mass of Americans are
not partisans of either route. They wish the canal,
and would, accept : with â¢ equal gratification either
Nicaragua or Panama. The one annoying feature of
the question for some time past has been the ap
parent deadlock- in Congress over the route, and now
if the Martinique calamity put an end to the con
troversy it will be looked upon as one of the evils
which after all was attended by some good.
QUT of the terrific eruption of volcanic action
in the West Indies there has come a re
newed _ agitation of the isthmian canal ques
tion. The advocates. of Panama insist that to con
struct ja canal through the volcanic country along
the Nicaragua route in the face of the dread expe
rience of Martinique and St. Vincent would be a
folly amounting to a crime. They demand, therefore,
a prompt acceptance' of the Panama route and jj the
abandonment of all further efforts in the 'direction, of
Nicaragua.
VOLCANOES AND THE CANAL.
. Three days after the horrifying disaster at St.
Pierre the interesting inhabitants of Fort de France,
twenty miles away on the same island, plunged into
the excitement of a local election. Perhaps it would
have been better if Mont Pelee had been nearer Fort
de France than the city which had passed into dread
history.

To demonstrate that the Judge has decided what
was in no sense before him the Examiner introduces
the views of medicasters and doctorlets-of various de
grees, of immaturity, and demonstrates again that in
Hearst's papers the State has a plague more injurious
to its interests, more fatal to its prosperity and more
sinister in its capacity for evil than all the epidemics
known among men.
The opinion of Judge Sloss has no relation" .what
ever to the bad judgment of the board in the matter
of the plague. It is a bare and impartial statement of
the law that official title cannot be tried by a pro
ceeding for injunction.
As far as the Board of Health was mistaken it had
the encouragement of all of .Hearst's papers, at a
time when The Call and the other papers here were
calmly refuting the claim that plague was in this city.
Events proved that we were right and the Examiner'
willfully wrong. Criminal effrontery exhausts its ca
pacity for malice in the charge now made that Judge
Sloss is doing what Hearst labored with devilish in
genuity and tireless repetition to do and to encourage
this same Board of Health in doing for months, to
the injury of California.
Sheer diabolism never went further. The first news
sent out 'from San Francisco affirming that the
plague was here was not sent by the Board of
Health, but went from the Examiner to Mr. Hearst's
New York Journal. In that paper, on the authority
of the Examiner, it was published under display
headings, occupying a page illustrated with pictures
of victims bursting with the disorder and with ac
companying text telling every alarming and horrify
ing* tale that deviltry could suggest. Mr. Hearst's
papers continued for months doing that which the
Examiner now says, merits quarantine and ruin to the
State.
It is very difficult to treat this Examiner pretense
with moderation. Carrying it out, that paper says
that the old board engaged* in "disseminating slan
derous information about San Francisco in every
city on the civilized globe. * * * They procured
the publication of statements reflecting on the health
conditions of San Francisco and which were calcu
lated to do immeasurable damage, not only to this
city, but to every industry in California. But there
is no plague here and there has been no plague here.
Not a single case of plague in a living person has
ever been seen by the Board of Health of San Fran-'
cisco." Therefore Mr. Hearst's paper pretends that
the legal title of that board to its office is determined
by the existence or non-existence of plague and that
the decision of Judge Sloss that such title can be tried
only by quo warranto is a decision that plague is
here! :
In the face of all this the Examiner lampoons the
Judge and misrepresents his decision and the prin
ciples upon which it rests. But, not content with
this, that paper goes further and declares that it is
in effect a judicial decision that the bubonic plague
exists here and makes necessary a quarantine against
the State because the old board professed to have
found that disease in this city!
The case is perfectly plain. The issue to be settled
is the Mayor's right to give and take away the title
to the office. This arises under the new charter, and
it is most desirable that it be judicially decided. This
cannot be done under proceedings for a writ of in
junction, therefore the suit for that purpose was vain,
because the fact to be -determined was out of range
of the action. The law provides that the right of
anybody to an official function can be tested by quo
warranto. It is a proper law, based on a proper
legal principle, and the point decided by Judge Sloss
has been passed upon in myriads* of actions by the
courts of this country and Great Britain.
The Examiner has shown vicious industry in at
tacking the* courts and teaching its credulous readers
that Judges make the law and have freedom of choice
to enforce it or not, as they see fit. Its. second at
tack on Judge Sloss is especially and peculiarly in
famous. A proceeding was instituted in'liis court to
test the issue of title between the two rival Boards of
Health in this city. The Mayor ousted the old board
and appointed a new one. The old board sought to
enjoin the new from exercising the functions of the
office. That right rests upon the title of the office.
Intelligent laymen know that title -to an office can
not be tried by injunction. Judge Sloss so decided,
and put the burden of proof on the old board by de
ciding that it is still in office, but must prove its title
under quo warranto proceeding.
General Grant was not the first man to discover
that the best way to secure repeal of a bad law is by
its strict enforcement. As long as the courts do not
enforce it, its character remains unknown to the peo
ple. When an action is brought under it the court
cannot refuse its enforcement on the ground that it
is a bad law. His judicial oath requires the faithful
enforcement of the law, and if harm come of it 'the
fault is not his, but rests with the law-making body.
One can imagine nothing more harmful to the ad
ministration of justice than teaching the people that
courts are responsible for the laws they administer.
IN two cases of importance recently before him
Judge Sloss has rendered decisions which no
doubt properly interpret and apply the "law. The
Judge does not make the law. It comes to him for
construction and application to cases that are in his
court $or trial. Many statutes may be of questionable
wisdom, but they may, be unwise without being un
constitutional, and .if constitutional they must be ap
plied to cases brought under, them.
That lesson applies to every city in the'State., In
an especial sense it is applicable to San Francisco.
In every election in this city "there are a considerable
number of people who do not vote, nor do they
even register so as to secure the privilege of voting
should they desire to do so. It is for that reason
bosses in control of a minority of voters attain such
undue influence in the city. If the workingmen,
busmessmen and professional men would register,
organize and rouse themselves to their political du
ties there would 'never be any danger from the
bosses and their push. Herrin might continue to
draw a salary for "pernicious activity" as long as
President Harriman is willing to pay it, but he would
no longer be a menace to San " Francisco. With a
full vote of the better elements of the community the
bosses would be powerless for harm and would soon
lose their influence even with the gangs that have
hitherto obeyed them. _-
attend to politics and look upon it : as a part of the
business of J the community in. which every citizen
should take part they can give their city a good gov
ernment free from boss control, but if they fall again
into the habit of neglecting to register or to vote
the well - organized . machine (of the boss will do its
work with the old-time effectiveness and the boss will
return to power.

Charles Wanner, a member of the
Knights of Pythias, who arrived from
Cleveland, Ohio, three days ago, is the
latest victim of a bunno steerer. Wanner
wears a Knight's button In the lapel of
his coat, and as he was walking along
Market street Tuesday night a well
dressed man accosted him, and, pointing
to the button, said, "I see you . are a
Knight." The stranger held out his hand
and gave Wanner the "grip."
Wanner was delighted to meet a mem
ber of the order, as he supposed, and in
conversation told his new acquaintance
that he would like to secure employment
here. The bunko man told him he had in
fluential friends, and it was arranged that
he should call upon Wanner at his hotel
yesterday morning and take him around.
He called according to agreement and
took Wanner to a room in the Pioneer
House at 48 Fourth street, where he was
introduced to I a game of poker. Wanner
got a good "hand" and his new-found
friend told him he would surely win. The
"friend" promised to look after the
"hand" till Wanner hurried to the hotel
and got $125 with which he returned to
the game. One of tne other two players
held a better hand and Wanner lost hl3
money.
Wanner informed Policeman T. C. Mur
phy of the occurrence and he arrested a
man who gave the name of J. R. Curby.

appeared with the money. Curby wag

CASES OF CHICKEN-POX
The suit of Bolton & De Ruyter, stock
brokers, against the Western Union Tele
graph Company to recover $64 damages
was on trial before Justice of the Peace
Dunn yesterday. The testimony showed
that the nrm sent a message at 7:12 in the
morning to their Chicago correspondent
to sell wheat at a certain figure. The
message was not delivered until 22 min
utes later, and in the meanttime the mar
ket had fluctuated to such an extent that
the firm lost $64. The case was submitted
on briefs.
Message "Was Delayed.
It is presumed the company will now
accept the money provided by the ordi
nance, which has for more than a year
been in the cjty treasury.
The attention of the Mayor was directed
to this ruling of the court and also to the
fact that it would require an expenditure
by the city of more than $20,000 to try the
case. A few days ago he sent for the
representatives of the water company
and stated to them that in view of the
evident disposition evinced by the city
to treat the company fairly" it would be
a graceful act on the part of the company'
to dismvs the suit and thus avoid the
necessity of a large and otherwise' un
necessary expenditure of the public
moneys for expenses of litigation.
The company's representatives declared
that the lump sum allowed by the ordi
nance for hydrants was entirely inade
quate; that the company had refused to
accept it, and that it had strong hopes of
having the ordinance set - aside by the
court. The Mayor argued that the good
v.-ill of the city was certainly of more
importance to the company than the' mat
ter of a few dollars; that the continua
tion of this litigation would lead only to
bad feeling; that the costs of the litiga
tion to the company would probably be
a& much as any benelit which it could
hope to achieve, and advised the company
strongly to dismiss its suit, whatever it
might conceive Its rights to be. After
considerable talk and suggestions of com
promise the company finally agreed on
the Mayor's solicitation to consent to a
dismissal of the action, thus saving much
expense.
The city interposed a demurrer to the
complaint, which was recently ; overruled
by the court, which held the complaint
to be sufficient, and the city > was ordered
to answer.
Through the efforts of Mayor Schmitz
the Spring Valley Water Works . has
agreed \o dismiss its suit against the city
now pending in the Federal courts to set
aside the ordinance passed by . the Board
of SupeMsors in 1901, fixing the water
rate from July 1, 1901, to July 1, 1902. In
this suit the company contended thafthe
rate allowed it was insufficient and inade
quate.

SAN JOSE, May 21.â From all parts of
Santa Clara County come news of re
joicing and words of encouragement for
the victors in Monday's election. The or
chardists are happy over the defeat cf
Mackenzieism and^Gagetsm. There - are
3000 members of the'Republlcan Good Gov
'ernment League In Santa Clara County,
and more than one-half of that number
reside outside the city. While they could
not vote in' the city election, they gave
every aid to the Worswick ticket, and
many of them were in town campaigning.
Gage has always been unpopular > with
this class. Four years ago they. stood by
him as a matter of party principle and
helped to roll up a big majority. For this
they expected ectne recognition, but in
stead Gage has handled Santa Clara
County affairs through Mackenzie. Every
man the league indorsed for appointment
was turned down. , . ,
This caused hundreds of voters of San
ta Clara County to sharpen their knives
for Gage, and now that Mackenzie ha3
been defeated in his own bailiwick Santa
Clara County is certain to go against the
Republican- ticket should Gage by any
chance become the nominee. " Â¦
The defection from the California Club,
Mackenzie's stronghold, since the harbor
master's defeat is like the exodus of rats
from a , sinking ship. There is a con
stant stream of callers at the reformers'
headquarters to assure the victors that
they are "all right." Many of these have
been supporters of Mackenzie for years.
James W. Rea, who gave his aid to'de
feat Mackenzie,^ his former lieutenant,
says, he has no ambition to again become
a "boss."

f Conservatory of Music Concert.
The impression has been growing for
some time past that the membership has
increased to such proportions that there
is need for a supremo governing power
to be composed of representatives from
State aeries.
also initiated an aerie with a large .mem
bership in Honolulu, H. T.
One of the propositions that the dele
gate will present to the Grand Aerie will
be that a Supreme Aerio be formed and
another will be that each State have a
Grand Aerie.
. The plaintiff now charges that he has
since learned that Poniatowski acted
merely as the agent and servant of Wil
liam H. Crocker and that he held the
stock and disposed of it solely for the
benefit and under the direction of the
defendant. William H. Crocker.
In conclusion the complaint. states that
Henry J. Crocker subsequently found that
the second mortgage bonds, of the Sierra
Railway Company did not have a market
value. It is claimed that the aggregate
value of the railway bonds amounts to
$5400. The plaintiff also avers that he of
fered to turn over the second mortgage
bonds of the Sierra Valley Railroad and
also the $7556 25 to William H. Crocker on
condition that his shares in the racing
corporations be returned to him, but his
proposal was refused.
The plaintiff now elects to retain the
second mortgage bonds of the Sierra Rail
way and the money given him in payment
for his shares in the Western Turf Asso
ciation and the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
and sues the defendant for damages
amounting to $S9,475, which, he alleges,
he sustained by reason of the transaction,
with interest on that sum and cost of suit.
HAVE NO MARKET VALUE.
The plaintiff further alleges that he was
entirely ignorant of the fact that any
agreement had been entered into between
William H. Crocker and Andre Ponia
towski, and that therefore after he had
read the defendant's letter he conferred
the power of attorney on Kline and with
full authority to dispose of his shares.
Plaintiff also alleges that August 8, 1900,
Kline showed him a letter supposed to
have been written by Ponlatowski, in
which Poniatowski offered $3125 a share
for the plaintiff's Western Turf Associa
tion shares and $44 a share for his Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club stock. In pay
ment for the stock Poniatowski offered
18S shares of the Sierra Railway Company
and $62 50 in cash. Plaintiff now claims
that he Instructed Kline to reject the
offer. and to submit a counter proposal
to Poniatowski. Later in the day, the
plaintiff alleges, he was informed by
Kline that Poniatowski's offer had been
accepted and that it was too late to can
cel the acceptance or to withdraw from
the transaction. ' Kline even refused to
surrender the power of attorney, which
had been given him by the plaintiff and
under which he had arranged the sale.
The plaintiff says that he finally sub
mitted with reluctance to the transaction
and turned- over his shares in both the
corporations to Kline and received in re
turn 108 second mortgage bonds of the
Seirra Railway Company and $7556 25 in
'< cash. Kline informed the plaintiff .that
the bonds and the money were payments
for the shares in the racing corporations.
KNEW OF NO AGREEMENT.
Henry J. Crocker avers that at this
time there was a close and intimate busi
ness relation existing between himself and
his cousin, who also owned property in
the two racing corporations.
According to the plaintiff's claim, the
transaction is the basis of the present suit,
and was brought about in the following
manner: William H. Crocker, it is al
leged, entered into an agreement July 23,
law), with his brother-in-law, Andre Poni
atowski, to obtain possession of the capi
tal stock of both the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club and the Western Turf Association.
To accomplish this, William H. Crocker
wrote to the plaintiff, stating that he had
placed his shares of stock in the two corr
porations in the' hands of G. W. Kline and
Wellington Gregg, both of whom, the
plaintiff avers, are employes of the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank, to be disposed
of by them. . In this letter Henry J.
Crocker claims he was urged to also put
his shares in the care of these two men
so that the sale of his and his counsin s
interests might be consummated at the
same -time.
Henry J. Crocker brought suit against
his cousin, William H. Crocker, president
of, the Crocker-Woolworth Bank, yester
day afternoon to recover â¢ $89,475 damages.
The plaintiff alleges that he was defraud
ed of the sum sued for in August of 1900
in the disposal of his shares in the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club and the Western
Turf Association. Â¦
The complaint recites the fact that the
Western Turf Association- and the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club were at the time of the
transaction in question corporations exist
ing under the laws of the State, and then
alleges that on June ' 1, 1900, Henry J.
Crocker^ owner of 750 shares in the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club and of 665 shares in
the Western Turf Association, the shares
in the first named corporation being val
ued at ?lOO-a share, while in the second
the shares were worth $27,432 25.
Plaintiff Alleges He Was
Defrauded in Sale of
Certain Stock.

How to buy furniture
and carpets
without ready
money
. o- Â¦ i ,
We will loan you the money for a regular banking
rate of interest â six per cent. And you can pay us
back little by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the first-class furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big and fresh and where satisfaction is certain, and
whÂ«n you have made your selection you can pay your
bill in full with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
, and being compelled to select your goods from smaller
and inferior stocks?
The installment stores charge you ten per cent
above their cash prices when you ask for long credit
All you pay us is six per cent.
For example: If your purchases amount to $roaco
we- will charge you $io6.oo^-which is a six per cent
advance; then you pay us $20.00 cash and the balance
in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month.
â¢ If your purchases amount to $75-00 we will charge you
$79-$o; you make, us a cash payment on this of $15.00
and pay the balance at the easy rate of $6.45 pÂ«r
You save four per cent. You have the great privi-
lege of buying in a first-class store, and yet you get
all the advantages of the easy payment plan as offered
by the installment houses?
No amount of money is too small for us to loan.
/ Worth looking into, don't you think?

Increased Bevenne Could Be Utilized
In. Properly Equipping the
Police Department.
Chief 'Vrittman will oh June 1 introduce
the eiffht-hour; system for patrolmen, but
It "will sadly; cripple the department, he
says, unless ,-the; Supervisors agree on Frl
v <iay to make a sufficient appropriation for
the Increase of the force.
"Even at present," said the Chief yes
terday, "there are large portions of the
city -without proper police protection, and
It will be much worse, under the eight
hour system unless the force is increased.
The men will have to be divided i Into
three platoons instead of two, as at pres
ent, which means a reduction of about 20
per cent, for duty at one time.
"I can see a way out of the financial
difficulty and that is by increasing the
liquor license. It is only $84 per year, and
I would urge that it be increased to $200,
which is low: enough, considering the
license in other cities. As there are more
than 3000 saloons here, it can readily be
seen to what extent the revenue would
be Increased. . The city is growing and we
need thorough police protection, which
can only be accomplished byÂ» ari ade
quately equipped force."
WITTMATT FAVOES HIGHER
LICENSE ON THE SALOONS
This week's bill at the Chutes Theater
is peculiarly good, including Byrne and
West, a comedy duo,- Bacon and Wayne,
operatic duetists; Jack Syrncnds, the min
strel; the clever Sorensen; children; the
Petching brothers and their musical flow
er garden: Grant and Grant, colored com
edians, and new moving pictures. The
amateur performances given every Thurs
day night are as popular as ever.
Although it would seem that nearly ev
ery person in this city had seen "Fiddle
Dee Dee," there are still thousands of the
regular patrons of Fischer's Theater who
have not as yet witnessed a performance
of this delightful burlesque. During the
past week there has not been a single
night or matinee that the "standing
room" sign was not displayed before the
box office opened for the day, and it is
not unusuai to see a line a block in
length when the curtain has been rung up.
Orders are flocking in from the country
with every mail and it would not be a
surprise to see the comedy run for six
months. Kolb, Dill, Bernard, Blake and
Hermsen are a bunch of comedians who
get oceans of laughter by their work.
Maude Amber makes a host of friends by
her excellent singing and Freda Gallick
made a hit from the start. Such a com
bination, . taking the popular airs * and
travesties on them, makes "Fiddle Dee
Dee" a performance at which the cares
of the world can easily be forgotten.
According to the reports that have
reached San Francisco, her success in
"The Country Girl" is as great as her
"Madame Sans Gene." Her company is
said to be one of the strongest sent on
the road this season and is headed by a
trio of well-known players, Robert V.
Ferguson, Norman Hackett and T. C.
Hamilton.
John Drew's present engagement at the
Columbia is a success. As Christopher
Blngham In "The Second in Command"
he offers what is probably the finest work
of his brilliant career. Kathryn Kldder
will commence a two weeks' engagement
at the Columbia next Monday evening.
She will revive an old English comedy
called "The Country Girl." Miss Kidder
has for several years, it Is said, wished
to impersonate that famous role of Peggy,
the comical heroine of the play, but a fit
ting opportunity never presented itself un
til this spring.
Fanny Mclntyre, the new leading lady
fit the Central, has made quite a hit. She
possesses all the dramatic fire so neces
sary for one in meiodrama. She is rap
idly becoming popular with the patrons of
the playhouse. "Woman Against Woman"
is a powerful play and the stock company
is on its mettle to do full justice to the
roles. There will be a special matinee on
Decoration day.
"The Lottery of Love" is making a hit
at the California. The Neill Company
does full justice to Augustin Daly's amus
ing comedy. Owing to difficulties encoun
tered in staging a new play, Mr. Neill has
found it necessary to make a change in
the piece announced for next week.
BroadhursL-Â« new romantic comedy,- "The
Bed Knight." was billed for its initial
production on Sunday night, but the au
thor has decided that another week will
be required to fully complete all of the
many details of the big production. It is
Mr. Broadhurst's desire to have his new
play as perfect as possible on the opening
night.
' Nelll's masterpiece, "A Bachelor's Ro
mance." will be the attraction at the Cal
ifornia next week, and "The Ked Knight"
will positively follow.
"The Singing Girl" is in its third week
at the Tivoli Opera-house. The music in
this popular opera is catchy and the mem
bers of the company do full justice to it.
Annie Myers has scored a big hit in the
title role. Hartman, Webb and Cashman
furnish the comedy and do well. Cun
ningham's rich barytone voice is beard to
advantage in a number of selections. The
chorus in well drilled and the staging is
beyond the ordinary. The opera is en
joying crowded houses and bids fair to go
a few more weeks. It is to be followed
by "The Toy Maker."
Edward Harrigan is doing "Waddy
Googan" at the Grand Opera-house this
week. The play gives him opportunity to
display his talents. To-night "Old Laven
der" will be produced for the especial ben
efit of the Knights of Pythias. The rest
of the week will be devoted to "Waddy
Googan."
The Orpheum bill this week is the best
that popular house has had in many
months. Every turn is worth seeing and
the interest does not lag a minute. Lotta
Gladstone is the best on the excellent pro
gramme. She Is a monologist of the
first order. Dooley and Fowler are very
clever comedians) who do some difficult
dancing and sing very creditably. Midg
ley and Carlisle are old favorites. Gertie
Carlisle is accorded a warm reception at
every performance. The rest of the card
is very good.
The Alcazar Theater is enjoying good
business with "The Brixton Burglary" as
a drawing card. It is a comedy of rare
merit and Is causing audiences to laugh
heartily. The company has taken kindly
to the play and is doing its usual good
Â¦work. Next week "His "Wife's Father,"
one of the funniest comedies ever given
here, is to be produced.
Excellent Bills Offered to
Patrons by Local Play

strained from Jumping Into the ring.
SEATTLE, May 21.â Perry. Queenan
knocked out Dal Hawkins in the ninth
round to-night. The fight was to have
gone twenty rounds for a purse of $1000
and was brought off in the Seattle Thea
ter. Both men were going strong up to
the final round and honors were easy
though Queenan was the stronger man
of the two. Queenan got Hawkins Into
a neutral corner, feinted wtih his left and
shot his right home to the mark. Hawkins
dropped as If shot. He was down for
the count of six, but gamely got to his
feet. Perry rushed at. him blindly and !n
a wild exchange Hawkins sent Queenan
to the floor. There was not power enough
In the blow to make lt effective, how
ever, and Queenan arose with both arms
working like flails. Queenan beat Haw
kins down, and when Hawkins' head hit
the floor the second time he stayed there
He was all out and had to be carried to
his corner.

Finally, after others of the hunting party
had sent five bullets, into the bear's body,
it turned and ran. It was followed a half
mile, and when the party again came up
on the sheep-slayer It law cold in death.
The party started from the Harlan gcat
ranch and just as it reached the ravint
which divides the peaks of St. John and
Sheet Iron mountains the dogs bayed the
bear. He was in the brush, so the Harlan
brothers entered the thicket to drive him
out. The bear suddenly attacked them,
striking one of the hunters a terrific blow
that tore all the clothing from his body,
but the man managed to get away. The
beast then turned its attention to the sec

leaped In upon it and caused it to direct
its fight toward them.
WILLOWS, May 21.â For several years
a large brown bear has been causing the
sheepmen of St. John and Sheet Iron
mountains of the Coast Range in Glenn
County a great deal of trouble, making

was recently formed and started out to
capture or kill the bear. Word has just
reached Willows that bruin has been
brought down, two of the partyâ Chri3
and Hehn Harlanâ almost losing their
lives during the proceeding. The bear
weighed more than 800 pounds and is said
to have been the largest brown bear ever
killed in these mountains.

TRURO. K. S., May 21.â A strange funeral
mlxup and case of mistaken identity has just
come to light here. It all happened through
a mistake of a Reno, Nev., undertaker, who
shipped a body to Truro as that of Hari-y
Murray, who was supposed to have died in
Reno on May 1 from pneumonia. The hos
pital authorities at Reno identified the dead
man as Harry Murray and wired Angus Mur
ray, his father, here. A few days later the body
arrived, and, although the dead man did not
look much like young Murray, the funeral was
held, as it was thought the young man's ap
pearance might have changed in the two years
he had been away. .His sister, Mabel, died
within a few days of the body's arrival, and
the relatives held a double funeral.
To-day a second telegram came, saying that
there was a mistake and the body was not
Murray's, but that of a man who had stolen
Murray's coat, with letters and papers, on
which the identification was based.
RENO, Nev., May 21.â J. W. Murray, a
brother of Harry Murray, who was sup
posed to have died in the County THos
pital three or four weeks ago and whose
body was shipped to Nova Scotia, is here
Investigating a case of mistakenJdentity.
It seems that the body shipped to Nova
Scotia was that of Daniel Callahan in
stead of the remains of Harry Murray.
Callahan stole a coat from Murray con
taining newspaper clippings and a receipt,
on which the identification was based. As
a matter of fact, Harry Murray is alive
and well in Utah. The following dispatch

"In the name of the French army,

me the extreme pleasure of admiring the

step and precision in maneuvering are
evidence that the Russian, army proudly
maintains its high renown. Just as com
mon sympathies and wide Interests have
united the two peoples, so the noble
brotherhood of arms and reciprocal es

furnished Russia and France both a guar
antee for the exercise of their rights and
an aegis under which they can in all
tranauillity follow the fruitful labors
which are rendering the two nations more
prosperous and augmenting their power
and legitimate influence.
"Mr. President: The troops whose
march past you have Just witnessed are
happy to have been privileged to render
honors to so highly esteemed a chief of
state. The lively sympathies felt by the
Russian army for the splendid army of
France are well known. They constitute
a real brotherhood of arms, which we can
regard with all the greater satisfaction
because these imposing forces are not
destined to support one another aggres
sively, but on the contrary to strengthen
the maintenance of general peace and
safeguard respect for those high princi
ples which assure the well-being and con

my glass to the prosperity and glory of
the grand army of France."

ST. PETERSBURG, May 21.â To-day
the people seem largely engaged in try
ing to size up the importance of President
Loubet's visit and to estimate its value
in the scale of international politics.
French journalists, who have' arrived hero
in vast numbers, seem to have an idea
tnat the visit and reception are more of
an official and less of a general nature
than had been supposed.
In this idea the French newspaper rep
resentatives would seem from present ap
peaTances to be right. The fact of the
President remaining at Tsarskoe-Selo
considerably limits the extension ot the
demonstration of the general popular dis
play of enthusiasm. It is understood that
the rules as to general visiting there will
be very strict, and that there will be no
special encouragement given for the gath
ering of large masses of the populace. All
compliments of every possible kind will
be paid to Russia's guest, but there will
be no Immense public demonstrations.
Russia does not think any such are
needed.

And a word here, where we meet to honor
the memory of those ' who drew the great prize
cf death in battle, a word in reference to -the
survivors. I think that one lesson every one
who was capable of learning anything learned
from his experience in that war, was ths old,
old lesson that we need to apply in peace quite
as much â the lesson that the man who doej
not cere to do any act until the time for
heroic action comes does not do the heroic act
when the time does come. Tou remember,
comrades, it is barely possible some of you re
member being the man who when you enlisted
had a theory that there was nothing but splen
dor and fighting and bloodshed in the war,
and then had the experience at once of learn
ing that the first thing you had to do was to
perform commonplace duties and -perform
them well. '; The work of any man in the
campaign depended opon the resolution and In
telligence with which he startedVabout doing
each duty as it arose, not waiting until he
could choose the duty that he thought suf n -
clently spectacular to do; doing the duty that
came to hand. . - - .-.
That is exactly the lesson that all of us
need to learn in time of peace. It Is not
merely a great thing, but an indispensable
.thing, i that the nation's citizens should be
ready and willing to do for it at the time of
need. What we need most in . this republic is
not special genius, is not unusual brilliancy,
but the honest and upright adherence on - the
part of the masses of the citizens and their
representatives to the fundamental laws of pri
vate and public morality, which are now what
they have been during recorded history, and we
shall succeed or fall in making in this republic
what it should be madeâ I will go a little fur
ther than thatâ what it shall and must be
made, according to the â¢ manner in which we
resolutely set ourselves to the task of citi
zenship, which consists of doing the duties,
private and public, which in the assreuat %
make it ui>.
Mrs. President, and members of the society,
and you, my comrades, and finally officers and
men of the regular army, whom we took at
our models in the war four years ago: * It is a
pleasure to be here this afternoon to accept In
,the name of the nation the monument put up
by your society to the memory of those who
fell in the war with Spain â a short war, a
war. that, called for the exertion of only the
merest fraction of the giant strength of this
nation, but a war. the effects of which will be
felt through the centuries to come. . It is emi
nently appropriate that the monument should
be unveiled Â¦ to-day, the day which succeeded
that on which the free republic of Cuba took
Its place among the nations of the world, as a
sequel to what was done by those men who
fell, and by their . comrades in "08.
We went to war for a specific purpose. We
made for Cuba a specific pledge and we re
deemed that pledge to the letter? And I think,
my comrades, that we have peculiar reasons
to be Â¦ proud of one of our fellows who served
with us in that war, and under whom during
the last few years Cuba has taken these
strides forward which have fitted It to stand
alone â I speak of General Leonard Wood. And
great though the services were that General
Wood rendered during the war, they have been
surpassed by the inestimable service he ha.-?
rendered in peace to Cuba, and therefore to
our nation, for our interest was bound up in
the success and welfare of Cuba.
: The ceremonies were in charge of Md-
Jor General John R. Brooke, commander
of the 1 Department of the East, the mili

father took this fiendish way of gaining
revenge, or else- that the kidnaper, be
coming alarmed at the scope of the
search, was forced to abandon the child,
and left it where it. was quite likely to
be found by some of the searchers. The
fact that the baby was very hungry when
it was discovered, however, indicates that
it must have had no nourishment for
some hours at least.
The search in the grain fields for .miles
around the Pereira house was prosecuted
systematically yesterday and all last
night, hundreds of men tramped the sur
rounding country in the hope of hearing
the cries' of: the little fellow. So thor
ough was the hunt," and yet bo unavail
ing, that every one had come to the con
clusion that the .chilil had been kidnaped
and a reward of $500 was offered for its
recovery.
How the little fellow, whose second
birthday occurred but several months ago,
succeeded in traveling barefooted nve
miles over a route that at times lay over
rough hills and again through brush and
briar passes understanding. , When found
the child was actually playing on the
sandy bank of the creek. However, its
delight when It saw its rescuer was piti
ful. Its first words were a petition for
something to eat. The babe was hurried
home and soon had a sufficiency of food
to repay it for its two days' fast. The
little fellow's feet were somewhat bruised
from traveling over the rough ground,
but it is believed that the consequences
of its extended journey and fasting will
not be serious.
WILLOWS. May 21.-The search for thÂ«
two-year-old son of J. A. Perelra, who
disappeared from home at noon on Mon
day, ended this morning at 10 o'clock,
when an employe on the Finnell ranch
discovered the little fellow sitting on the
bank of Stony Creek, five miles from
home. The child immediately asked for
something to eat, but seemed unconcern
ed and did not show any ill effects of
his long fast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Sullivan, with a friend, visited Mora
ghan's oyster restaurant in -the California
market. He tendered his money for the
repast, but complained that the cashier
failed to give him 40 cents change that
he claims was due him. The cashier de
clared that he gave Sullivan the change,
but the latter insisted that he had not
done so and threatened that if the money
was not forthcoming he would take it out
of the cash register himself. It is said
that he was in the act of carrying out his
threat when Special Officer Harry Porter
came up and dazed him with a blow from
his club. The officer, according to Sullivan,
continued planting blows on the , top of
his head until he was in such a condition
that it was found necessary to take him
to the Harbor Hospital to have ' the
wounds attended to. Sullivan, who was
perfectly sober, was covered with blood

new league.
Short addresses were made by members
of the different organizations represented,

their loyal support to the movement.
Much emphasis was placed on the edu
cational possibilities of the movement,
and especial effort 'will be made to enlist
the aid of school children.
Mr. Knowland, speaking as chairman
and as a representative of the Native
tons, explained the object of the meeting
and the purposes of the proposed league.
After some discussion of ways and means
the chairman was instructed to appoint
ix committee of fifteen on permanent or

Miss Rosalie Harby petitioned that she
be permitted to Â«Uer upon the duties of
her position as vice principal of the Fair
inount School, to which she was elected
December 28, 1898. The petition was taken
under advisement.
M. E. Blanchard. principal of the Han
cock Grammar School, against whom
charges of inflicting: unusual punishment
on a pupil, John Raggio, have been tiled,
petitioned for a speedy trial. Blanchard
in a communication informed the board
that he has dismissed the action to pro
hibit Director Roncovieri from acting
with the board in the trial of the charges
and desires to have the matter settled
before the school vacation. The board
set next Monday morning as the time for
hearing the charges.
The Board of Education yesterday
aucpted a resolution providing that the
present salary schedule remain in force
lor the next fiscal year. This action sets
at rest the persistent rumors that ,ihe
salaries of teachers would be materially
reduced because of an alleged Insufficient
jippropriation. It will also be a disap
pointment to some teachers who peti
tioned for increased salaries. The Fi
nance Committee of the Board of Supervi
sors has recommended ample funds for
the proper maintenance of the School De
partment, but the construction ef new
>c!ioolhouses will have to be accomplished
jjy other means.
Mrs. J. Murphy and Mrs. J. Knaps,
j<: stresses of the Franklin School, and
Mrs. K. A. Hunter, janltress of the

frauding an innkeeper.. was tried before
Judge Fritz yesterday! * She came to this
city about six months ago intending to
purchase a lodging-house. She had $650,
and Charles Martin, a supposed friend,
induced her to place the money in his
care. Soon after getting the money Mar
tin left the city and went to Washing
ton leaving her penniless. He' wrote to
her that he j would soon send her back
the money, and she stopped the com
plaint in the hope that Martin would ful
fill his promise. He failed to do so, and a
friend advised her to surreptitiously leave
the house as she was unable to pay her
bill of $123, and she did so aided by mes
senger boys. The Judge continued the
further hearing of the. case till May 31.
"I suggest,"- said Kilburn, "that the en
gineer make his report by next Saturday
and let us know the precise facts."
Budd inquired of Engineer Norton if
Inspector Duff would be in a position to
know if the specifications were changed,
and on receiving an affirmative reply he
suggested that Duff be invited to file a
supplementary report.
This was agreed upon by Commissioners
Kilburn, Mackenzie and Kirkpatrick, and
Engineer Norton announced, that he would
submit his report at the meeting of the
board Saturday morning. The board then
adjourned.
; Attorney James Budd, as counsel for the
board, suggested that "Engineer Norto.i
be asked to report such changes in the
specifications as he had cognizance of.
"That will not do, in my judgment,"
said Â¦ Kirkpatrick. "He has already re
ported to the board that the specifications
were not changed. How, then, could we
get anything new from him?"
Budd answered that this was the legal
course to pursue. "If the report is un
satisfactory to the board," he resumed,
"there are other . methods that may be
adopted. If the report should be wrong
there are assistants who might inquire
into the matter and submit reports to the
beard."
This board was entitled to believe that the
specifications were beinsr adhered ' to by tho
engineer and contractor. The reports of the
engineer and inspector were favorable and as
far as I am concerned I had no knowledge of
any changes in the specifications having been
made. Alter a contract has been awarded this
board has no power to chanse specifications In
any particular whatsoever. The inspector upon
whose reports we relied came to us highly
recommended and we had no reason to suppose
he would file misleading reports. I think this
board should appoint a committee whose duty
it shall be to find out In what respect the
specifications were changed and who profited
by reason of such change.
The board directed Chief Engineer I*
D. Norton to file a report on the work in
question at the meeting of the board Sat
urday morning. This report, shall give in
detail all changes made in the specifica
tions, together with data showing whether
such changes, if any, were to tne advan
tage or. detriment of the Staffc. . .Â¦ ' Â¦
The Call's charges were brought up by
President Kilburn after the transaction
of the routine business. He said the mat
ter was of sufficient gravity to engage the
attention of the board. He desired that
some sort, of inquiry should be made in
order to arrive at the facts. ; ,
, Commissioner Kirkpatrick echoed j the
sentiment of Kilburn. He said: .
The State Board of Harbor Commission
ers took official cognizance at its meeting

f Beginning Thursday, several prominent storekeepers will
give to the public a 6 per cent Cash Coupon with all pur-
chases, for the asking, payable in United States coin by
their brokers, in any amount, from one cent up. This is
a new move on the part of the merchants, and will con-
tinue indefinitely. The storekeepers believe the public will
; show their approval, and are willing to share their profits.
Six per cent is a good share. It is also a great big saving
to the buyerâ $1000 spent in a year would save $60 by
this 6 per cent cash discount, equal to savings bank interest
of 3 per cent on $2000 of hard-earned money.

WANT RAILROAD TRACKS
IN THE MISSION BEMOVED
Hesidents Urge Mayor Schmitz to Im
pose Condition in Franchise
fpr Cut-Off Line.
A committee of Mission residents, con
sisting of Eugene Sullivan. T. B. Slevin,
George Center. William Watson, Georga
H. Roundey, A. B. Maguire and A. S.
L>illie, waited on Mayor Schmitz yester
day to enlist his aid in Inducing the South
ern Pacific Company to remove the tracks
in the Mission as a condition for tho
granting of a new franchise to the cor
poration for its cut-off shore line.
The committee made vigorous objection
to the continuance of the tracks In tha
Mission, which they declared to be a
nuisance. They urged the. Mayor to seo
that one of the conditions of the new
franchise be that the road be completed
within six months. The Mayor helil,
however, that one year would be a fair
.period for the road to be put In good con
dition. Mayor Schmitz promised to exert
hi? influence with the officials of tha
Southern Pacific Company with a view to
securing the abandonment of the tracks
in the Mission. _,

CHICAGO, May 21.â Wheat was dull 4o-day
Early there was a show of good strength on
the corn bulge and on reports of a good export
demand and purchases of ' September options
supposed - to be for the foreign account. ' The
local crowd started to bull the market and
succeeded for a time, corn sagged and the
wheat market turned very dull.- Liquidation
then set in and as the shorts had covered early
there was no demand for stuff from that quarter.
General conditions were favorable to the sell
ing side. The weather was clearing Northwest
and rains fell in the Ohio Valley. July wheat
opened V4@V4c to Vic lower- at 74%c to 74%@
74%c, advanced to 75Vfc@75Vic and slumped to
a weak close, %@%c depressed, at 74VJc.
Corn had very good early support, but could
not hold the advances that were made during
the first hour. As on yesterday the principal
bull factor was the very small run of cars. On
the advance, profit-taking and short selling
caused a relapse. July closed fairly firm. Uffl

A circular for Australia says: "Since the

na, 3103 tons; Mario, 2O42 tons; Paramita, 2070
tons; Crompton, 4353 tons *_total, 12,568 tons.
There are thirty-four vessels already named for
loading Australian coal for future delivery here.
These vessels have a carrying capacity of over
00,000 tons. This shows an increase of (jOOO tons
since the first of this month. It is very singu
lar that with the extremely low prices now rul
ing for colonial freights, four new names should
be added to the loading list. The last rates
named are lower than for several years past,
and the present depressed condition of the coal
market here, and for future deliverleSj gives lit
tle hope for any Improvement. Our coast col
lieries are gradually drawing off their carriers,
which is leading to a furthe.* depression in coal
freights from the north. The main cause of
the discouraging conditions now existing in the
fuel line is solely attributable to the inroads be
ing made by fuel oil, the prices for which re
main unchanged. The quantity of oil now be
ing extracted is very largely in excess of the
demand. Several large refineries In course of
construction will eventually relieve the mar
ket from a large proportion of the overplus now
being taken out. The Mario, from Newcastle,
is discharging a cargo of Dudley coal. Its ap
pearance indicates that it Will prove to be a
lirst-class household coal."

tTHE SITUATION AS REGARDED BY WALL.
STREET EYES.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The improved undertone in the stock mar-
Vr\ during the week were due entirely to
rnsler conditions in the money market, and
vould have been <?ven more. hopeful had It not
lipfn for the coal strike. Last week's strin
prncy was due to an unusual number of large
obligations maturing about the same period.
Sime calculations estimated these payments
at about $80,000,000. and though this sum was
not at any time actually withdrawn from the
niarket yet the transfer of loans and deposits
Inevitably caused the temporary lock
ing up of large sums and conse
quent stringency in call loans. At
the same time, the banks have been exercising
more discrimination in regard to collateral,
end this, too. encouraged a hardening of rates.
Very fortunately relief came in the form of a
break in sterling exchange rates, owing to lib
eral offerings of security and loan bills by for
vzen bankers. This assistance from abroad
was very timely and materially changed the
erpect of the money market. Funds are return
i:ig more freely from the interior, and the
v-.oitly bank statements should henceforth
thow rising averages. It ie noticeable that
linkers exhibit no uneasinees ever the situa
l.on, presumably because of their knowledge
concerning maturities and of their confidence
in the large borrowers who are chiefly respon
sible for the present expansion in locns. Were
the latitr feature due to the calls of a large
number of *mall borrowers the situation would
ljt.- very differtnt. It must be remembered.
1 mnever; that the present loan expansion does
1V- - . promise immediate ease in rates.
'M i>ur foreign trade returns continue to t-how
sjjeciining balance of trade. In April our ex
cess of exports was only $:i3,3OC.UtjO. against

the ten months of the fiscal year the excess of
exports was $4">o.COO.<m:o in 1902. against $384.
3<H.i,0l l U In HK-i. These ehar.ges were chiefly
<3ue to a fall In exports from $1,260,000,000 in
the first ten months of 19J1 to $1,109,000,000 In
the same period of 1002. This is a decline of
S7o.000.o00 in ten months, of which nearly $C6.
<XÂ»0,000 were in breacistuffs. The total decline
in corn exports war $57,000,000. showing how
important a factor lact year's com damage
proved !a our foreign trade as well as In our
domestic markets, seme of which are still
flowing the effects of scarcity. At the 6ame
time, our export trade is still far ahead of or
dinary years, and it is only when comparisons
are made with the phenomenal years of 1900
and lÂ»01 that the results are unfavorable. Our
Importations continue large, especially of semi
manufactured product* which enter as raw ma
terials into other products, showing that our
industries continue very active.
â¢"The future of business largely depends upon
th" crop situation, provided the monetary out
look is secure. Recent conditions have been
vr-ry favorable to the growing crops, affording
considerate fompensation for the early losses
li. â¢winter wheat. There Is ever}- prospect thai
high prices for corn will insure a large acreage
of that cereal, and it seems hardly likely that
the country will be again called upon to suffer
such a serious disaster from drought as It en
dured last year. With ordinary crops, there
fore, we ought to be assured of another vear
of prosperity. The iron trade Shows no indi
cations whatever of cessation in its remarkable
boom, and the most conservative authorities are
still giving estimates of production that the
most optimistic would have ridiculed three
> ears ago.
'Speculation on the Stock Exchange has been

There was an aggressive buying of Amal
gamated Copper at Intervals . during the day.
A further advance in the price of raw copper
here and strength In the London copper market
were supplemented by reports of' great im
provement in the trade. There were also ru
mors of a compromise of the conflict of interests
in the trade. The foreign exchange market
continued to show a yielding tendency in spite
of the falling rate of money. This afforded re
lief from the apprehension that a fail in the
money rate would lead to prompt exports of
gold. London's hopes of an early jjgace in
South Africa was an additional factor In the
strength of the market, which was quite
marked at the close of the day.
Bonds were dull but quite firm. Total sales
(rar value). $21,415,000.
United States new 4s declined %, the old 4s
and the- 3s 14, and the 2s H per cent on thu
last call to-day.
a settlement of the strike were somewhat
dashed by the aggrieved tone taken by the coal
operators toward those activities. Wall street,
however, maintains its conviction that the two
sices to the struggle are not very far apart and
both averse to a long and costly struggle. The
consequence is a constant expectation of the
announcement of a settlement. The conspicu
ous strength of Canadian Pacific -and Its affili
ated lines continued to-day and was a. notable
Influence on the whole market. The strength
of the stock was unexplained beyond floor gos
elp of the imminence of the corner and a re
vival of the reports of a strong trans-Atlantic
steamship line in the interest of the line and
to be subsidized by the Canadian Government.
Another sustaining factor was the wide ad
vances in the usually inactive stocks
and of minor railroad stocks available
for combination and absorption. The demand
for those stocks was stimulated by the plans
for taking over the Chicago. Indianapolis and
Louisville in the joint interest of the Southern
Railway and the Lou'evllle and Nashville and
the acquisition of the Ann Arbor In the interest
of the Wabash. v

The doctors say the wound is serious
and may end fatally. The accident hap
pened before the eyes of more than 6000
people, who had gathered to witness the
afternoon races.
Â¦- Nicholson was carried by willing hands
to the hospital back of the grand stand,
where he was cared for until prepara

Francisco. On arriving in this" city he
was taken to the Lane Hospital, s, .
The steer. Brick by name, which is
owned by McDurmick, was very hostile,
and caused much â¢ trouble while being
taken to the .starting place. Just as
Nicholson was about to mount, the ani
mal lurched toward him, knocking him
down. While he was prostrated the steer
charged and struck him with a horn in
the center of the forehead, causing a
fracture of the skull.
Al Nicholson, who lives at Sixteenth

perhaps fatally injured yesterday at Em

Six Thousand People Witness Excit-
Mains was next asked to produce a
scrap of writing from any of these per
sons pertaining to the business of the
corporations named, and he replied that
he had none at present, all letters from
them having been destroyed at his home
by the mother of Walter Scott Gifford
shortly after his arrest. With reference
to $1.3SO,000 which Mains had told Dr.
Bennett was in this city to the credit of
Mains, the witness could give no satisfac
tory explanation. â¢ He had no knowledge
Â¦ of its whereabouts. He made the asser
tion also that a large number of the
bankers of this city were the members of
the Combined Bankers, but that they
were keeping the matter a profound se
cret.
.' Mains' cross-examination will be re
sumed this morning. Â¦ ;-,
Charles R. Mains took the witness
stand yesterday in the United States Dis
trict Court to defend himself from the
charge of having attempted to bunko Dr.
Charles E. Bennett of "Wauseon. Ohio,
out of $3000. He told a story of million
aires unknown to the financial world sa
lcctlng him as their -western representa
tive to examine into railroad, oil and other
propositions to be acquired by an aggre
gation of organizations also unknown to
the commercial community, -which organ
izations had a capital of four billion dol-
HIs story was to the effect that
Marcus Rothchlld. an English million
aire, doing business in London, Paris,
Chicago and New' York, had called
or him in Battle Creek. anchi
can with TV. Davis and another wealthy
mari named Griftord, and employed him
to come to California. He was to investi
gate the truth of reports that good busi
ness enterprises were In brokers' ofncea
In this city and that the brokers were
unable to get the money to finance them.
He was detailed also to examine Into the
feasibility of getting a railroad into
Southern California by some other route
than by way of the Needles because that
was a very expensive route. Mains said
he was made attorney for the American
and European Fuel, Mining and Trans
portation Syndicate and the American and
London Safe Deposit Surety and Invest
ment â¢ Company. He commended his
friend Walter Scott Gifford. a 560 per
month man, unknown to fame as a finan
cier, for the position of joint actuary for
seven syndicates representing the com
bined capital of four billion dollars.
Davis, Grifford and Rothcbild held a
meeting in his -house a few months ago.
he said, and passed resolutions appoint
ing Walter Scott Gifford as the actuary
and transacting other business. Mains
swore further that $25,000,000 was paid to
Davis as the representative of the corpor
ations and the securities were placed by
Davis in a safe deposit box in the vaults
of the California Safe Deposit and Trust
Company.
When asked by Assistant United States
Attorney Banning as to the address and
whereabouts of Rothchlld. Mains replied
that he did not know, lie said that he
rever knew Rothchild's address in New
York. London or Paris and that he sent
letters to that millionaire to the general
deliveries o f the postoffices in -those
cities. He was equally ignorant as to the
addresses of Grifford and Davis.

A QUEER STORY
The directors of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals met yes
terday afternoon for the purpose of in
vestigating the Charge that Special Officer
Levy had used the name of the society
for the purpose of getting permission to
kill a sick cow and that he had afterward
offered to sell the meat for human con
sumption. After a number of witnesses
had been examined, the accused was fully
exonerated. Levy proved to the satisfac
tion of the directors that the animal, was
really diseased and that he had to kill it
before attempting to take it away. Of
ficer Cottle of the Health Department was
the chief accuser of Levy.
ciety Is Discredited.
as Representative of Humane So-
Charge That He Abused Privileges
SPECIAL OFFICER LEVY
IS FULLY EXONERATED
Prisoner 1081, whose name is Smith, was
cinched in a straitjacket September 7,
1&00, and kept there continuously for twen
ty-eight hours for alleged neglect of duty.
As' a result he was permanently crippled.
As he is still an inmate of the prison he
may be broupht -before the Prison Direc
tors as a living example of the cruelties
The attaches of the prison are grum
bling over the way in which they claim
Wilkinson has treated them. It is
claimed that during the last winter they
weresubjected to many hardships because
oÂ£ Warden" Wilkinson's unwarranted and
impractical attempt to run the prison on
a much shorter financial basis than any
of his predecessors ever succeeded in do
ing. The prisoners were forced, so it is
said, to go through the winter so poorly
clad that they, endured terrible hardships.
Many other tales of cruelty to prisoners
are being told by reliable people who are
willing to testify if the Prison Directors
decide to investigate this phase of the
charges that are being openly made
against the Warden.
The use of the straitjacket at Folsom
.has maimed and crippled more than one
prisoner, and on two occasions prisoners
are claimed to have been pent to their
graves through the inhuman cruelty
which wa-s practiced upon them under
Warden Wilkinson's administration.
At all events. Warden' Wilkinson's
methods will be subjected to a searching:
investigation at the next meeting of the
Prison Directors. He is accused of- all
sorts of failings.
Warden Wilkinson, according to the in
formation given the postal authorities,
took from the mail pouch several letters
addressed, so it is said, to himself and
then locking it up again he allowed it to
be sent on to the Kepresa postoffice. If
this is true Warden Wilkinson will very
likely find himself in serious trouble with
the Government.
USE OF THE STRAITJACKBT.
A few days ago information was lodged
with the postal authorities that recently
Warden Wilkinson went to a railroad sta
tion near Folsom and, intercepting a bag
of mail before it was delivered into the
hands of Postmaster Smith at Kepresa,
which is the postal destination of all mail
addressed to attaches and Inmates of the
Folsom penitentiary, he opened it and ex
tracted letters therefrom.
Several days ago it came to the knowl
edge oi' the United States postal authori
ties that something was radically wrong
with the mail service at Folsom and In
spector Hare was detailed to investigate.
It is said that on many occasions guards
and other employes at the State Peniten
tiary have complained that they had well
founded suspicions that their letters were
being tampered with by somebody high
in authority at the prison.
upon to answer serious charges, as
numerous complaints have been recently
pcured into the ears of the Prison Direct
ors from reliable sources." Warden Wil
kinson may also be harassed with the
serious accusation of having tampered
with the United States mails, a charge
which is now being secretly investigated
for the Government at Washington by
Postal Inspector Frank Hare.
p*T|-53 HE indications are that when the
I State Board of Prison Directors
I meet next Saturday, Warden
11 Thomas Wilkinson willbe called
GOBED BY VICIOUS STEER.
The Prison Directors will probably be
anxious to listen to every bit of evidence
that tends to prove mismanagement on
ll:e part of Warden Wilkinson. Several
of the Directors may not be able to at
tend the meeting set for next Saturday,
and in that case R. M. Fitzgerald, chair
roan of the board, will postpone the hear
ing until all the members of the board
can be present.
Even while off duty the attaches of the
prison are under the ban of Warden Wil
kinson's czarlike methods. They claim
that he has made several rules which are
infringements against their personal
rights.
The prisoners at the FÂ°' s Â°m p r laon T H â¢
so poorly fed, as a result of Warden Wil
kinson's attempt to make a record by
unnecessarily reducing expenses, that
they are liable to join in a serious riot
very much like the affair that occurred
several years ago at San Quentin. The
prisoners' meat rations have been cut
nearly one-half, and the prisoners com
plalrTthat they often are sent out to work
in the morning on an empty stomach and
locked up in. their cells at night, still feel
ing the pangs of hungerâ all the result or
Warden Wilkinson's economical traits.
The guards of the prison are forced to
sleep on unclean sheets, and even their
allowance' of soap has been curtailed.
They are paid $50 per month, and out of
that Warden Wilkinson makes them pay
laundry bills for washing done by Chinese
prisoners in the prison laundry. The bed
clothing has heretofore been changed
once a week, but since Warden Wilkin
son has put his sudden economical ideas
into effect he has issued orders that the
bed sheets, which are made out of flour
packs, be changed only once a month.
Many more such petty acts have arrayed
nearly all of the attaches of the prison
against Warden Wilkinson, and it is like
ly that when the Prison Directors com
mence their investigation considerable
"dirty linen will be washed."
DIRTY LINEN TO BE WASHED.
Prisoner No. 4S69, James Dear, was
placed in a straitjacket March 6, 1901, and
when he was released eleven hours later
he was in a state of physical collapse. He
was thrown into his cell, where he lay all
night without medical attention. , He died
the following â¢ morning and the autopsy
showed his death to be due to congestion
of the kidneys, liver, lungs and brain. ',
Prisoner No. 481S, named Weitz, was
kept in a straitjacket for twelve hours
August 20 and -for. twenty-five and a half
hours on another occasion. As a result 01
Warden Wilkinson's alleged brutal meth
od of treating the men given over to his
charge both of Weitz's hands are perma
nently crippled. Hd Is still an inmate of
the institution and his injuries may be In
spected bv the Prison Dl rect0 J s 1 - lf ; t ? 1 ? y
see fit to inquire into the alleged brutality
ot the Warden. Â¦ Â¦ . T Â¦ Anf ..
Prisoner Molino. designated as No. 4091.
was allowed to lie in his cell for four
weeks without medical attention. He was
suffering: from a broken leg and the in
jured member knit by itself, leaving the
unfortunate man a hopeless cripple.
On January IS. 1902. Molino was placed
on the operating table to have the leg
broken over again, but he died during the
operation.- Such treatment or human be
ings has arrayed a host of influential cit
izens against Warden Wilkinson s admin
istration. They will Insist that a thorough
investigation* into the charges be made Dy
the Prison Directors.

We still have your size. Although the fact that we are
selling the cream of 1902 shoes at* "sale" prices, a thing

business for days; yet it must-'be remembered that we had

ent lines of shoes. They won't last forever, of course. You
had better call while you can get bargains like these: ;
