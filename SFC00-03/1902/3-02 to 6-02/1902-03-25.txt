agreement has occurred between the ves

tributed to pay for repairing the. church.
The Rev. ; Mr., Klrby.the Vicar,. explained
to a meeting of the vestry, that he had
appealed to the United States, and had
raised sufficient money to restore the his
toric edifice. The vestryman produced an
American newspaper containing an arti
cle detailing the decay of the church anJ
appealing for ! funds. He declared that
the statements Â« made were untrue, and
that the parishioners had been humbled
by this appeal to the United States. The
Rev. Mr. Klrby retorted 'that .his ex
perience showed that the Penn parishion
ers were not overwllllng to contribute to
the church . funds, but as his efforts had
been met in such a spirit he would return
the money received , to the donors.'

great de^al from Cuba in return for the
little we would grant to her. . â¢Â» 'â¢ ' â¢ ;
; NO DEFINITE PROPOSITIONS. ;
. The interchange of views became quite
general, there, being nothing in the way
of definite propositions one way or the
other, but merely an agreeable expression
of opinion as to what was best "to ' be
done under all the circumstances of the
situation.
In the course of this general talk the
suggestion was made that if the Payne
bill had been modified so as to take oft
the. differential on refined sugar some of
the grounds of the opposition might have
been removed. However, there was no
request, so far as can be learned, that the
bill be amended in ; this particular at the
present stage. The plan of rebate, which
was urged at one time, also came in for
discussion and explanation. â¢ '
At the conclusion of j*he conference the
general understanding was reached that
any 1 statements made to the public would
be to the general effect that no conclu
sions , were , reached and that' the confer
ence was confined to a general inter
change of views.
It is understood that the President will
see some of the members of the Ways
and Means" Committee to-morrow, thus
familiarizing himself ; with both sides of
the Issue which has recently arisen in
'the House. ; He hopes that this general
! interchange with the leaders from both
eides may bring about unanimity of ac
tion on whatever is done in behalf of
Cuba.

President Roosevelt- in- his official capa
city for the first .time this evening; when
the former was. the guest of honor at an
Informal dinner at the .White House. - The
affair was Intended as a mark ' of cour
tesy to President-elect Palma, who ex
pressed his high appreciation of , the honor
shown him. The others Â» present were
Mrs. . Roosevelt, Secretary and Mrs. Root,
Minister and Mrs. Bellamy Storer. Gen
eral I^eonard -'."\Vo6d and ' Gonzales de
Quesada and Diego "Tamayo, "well known
Cubans, who came over from New.' York
The callers were frank to concede that
they found the President desirous 'of ex
tending effective concessions to Cuba by
the reciprocity plan. In this connection,
Â¦it was stated, the President drew atten
tion to the fact that the Sibley amend
ment limiting the reciprocity period to
December 1. 1303. gave the Payne bill a
rather one-Bided aspect, as It asked Cuba
to adopt our naturalization and immigra-
What should be done to meet the condU
tlons, and also the question of harmonlz
ir.Â£ conflicting interests so that there
might be unanimity of action on the part
of the Republicans In Congress, was the
chief topic discussed.- It was stated after,
ward by those who . participated in the
conference that it was of the most ad
mirable and pleasant character, and that
there was not the remotest suggestion on
the part of the chief executive which
could be construed as seeking to urge
them to yield their personal convictions.
On the contrary, it is stated the President
llEtened to the recital of the difficulties
which had been encountered by those who
opposed the reciprocity plan, and also
hetrd from them the various plans by
which they had hoped to reach an agree
ment.
THE TOPICS DISCUSSED.

the House of Representatives who have
been foremost in opposing the plan of

have the approval of the administration.
The gentlemen were Representatives
Tawney and Morris of Minnesota, " Dick
of Ohio, WllUam A. Smith of Michigan,
Minor of Mississippi, Metcalf of Califor
nia and Payton of West Virginia. The
call was at the request of the President,
who desired an exchange of views to the
end that harmonious action might be se
cured in such steps as are taken in behalf
of Cuba. As General Wood has arrived
here from Cuba and as several members
of the Cabinet were at the White House
while the Congressmen were there a're
port gained circulation that . Secretary
Root and General Wood were present; at
the conference. This, however, was not
the case, as the President and Congress
men remained alone In the Cabinet room
for the hour and a half that they were
together. The talk took a wide range,
covering the conditions in Cuba.

that the President, in his letter,' discussed
the question with great freedom and can

an entirely different construction upon the
failure, of General Miles' effort than "the
public has derived from newspaper publi
cations. The Cabinet unanimously agreed
with the President's view that the requeot

Only the day before the Government
had appealed to the courts for injunctions
to restrain a number of railroads, from,
violating the interstate - commerce law
and It was known that other roads would
be proceeded against in the same manner.
It was the purpose of the railroads and.
a part of the business that brought
Etubba cut of the wilds of Mexico to
make it obligator? upon the Government,
acting through -the"- Interstate Commerce
Commission, to force an application for a
blanket Injunction onyall railroads. A
trattlc..* manager-. of an* eastern railroad,
who is now in Los Angeles, said:
"There will be a fight made against the
interstate commerce law that, before it
is ended, -will have proved the strength
of the railroads of the United" States
against the Government. Nearly every
railroad. will be in the fight, and, if possi
ble, the Government will be put on the

Steele said that there..ha& never been
any iron-bound agreement between Hill
and Morgan that they could hold on to
their Northern Pacific stock. ' The pjan of
retiring Northern Paciflc preferred had
come up before 1901, he said. On May 1,
1901. J; P. Morgan '& Co. had about
t^ 000,000 worth of- Northern Paciflc, com
mon and between May 1 and. May 7 they
boujrht about $15,000,000 worth. In the
middle of the summer they sold $10,000,000
worth of it to the Northern'" Securities
Company, getting stock of the Northern
Securities Company in return.
Charles Steele of Morgan & Co.' was
called. He said Mr. Bacon of that firm
had* conducted the purchases of Burling
ton, stock, made last. year. The firm.or
ganized -a syndicate to raise 570.OO0.CO0
cash, which was necessary in order to
control Burlington. The object s of 'the
purchase, he said, was to reap the profits
that would result from .getting Eastern
and -Southeastern connections , for the
Burlington.
To Control Burlington.
He said that the 'Stock was not pur
cliasea lor fhe purpose oi securing control
of tnc Burlineion for the Union Pacinc.
He also declined to answer a question as
to whether he had acted for any railroad
interests in making the purchase of Bur
lington stock. He said he . had no pre
vious knowledge ,-of the efforts of the
Northern Pacino and the Great Northern
to get hold of the Burlington.
Scniff said his firm never represented
the Union Pacinc or the Oregon Shore
Line as bankers in the stock market. He
declined to say whether the tlrm had so
represented Harriman. As far as he could
â¢recollect, the. purchases made by his firm
of Northern Pacinc before Mar 5 last year
amounted to *s. 000,000. A few- weeks -later
! this "stock "was transferred, parr to the
I Union Partite :and- part to the Oregon
Short Line. The \tltness said he had no
conference with J. Pierpont Morgan con-
I cerhlfig'fhesv- purchases, but there^ was a
1 conference between ; himself ' and _Ham
finan on one sideand- J. J.rHlll and Charles
] Steele of J. P. Morgan &Co, on the other.
' He said there were two such conferences,
-but; at neither of them, was there a
show-down to determine whether the Hill
â¢or -Harriman interests obtained a ma
' ioritv-of NoTthetn Pacinc -common 'Stock.
fSchlif said -he did not. learn. >of,- the fact
' that the, Union Pacific was disposing of its
I Northern Pacific holdings until the mat
ter came before the board of directors, of
Si which h$ was a member/

\ ness said Hill asked him to take a place

!Â«ald'he first learned of the retirement; of

know whether Harriman had been con

Manager Filcher of the State Board of
Trade Bays that the raising^ of money
will be one of the first maxters to ba
considered by the promotion committee.
In his opinion, good men should be se
lected to can\*ass San Francisco thor
oughly, giving every property holder &n<]
every corporation a chance to help in the
work. Very likely the Board of Super
visors will be asked to appropriate for
the purpose of encouraging immigration
the full amount permitted under the law,
namely $3000. To provide that the can
vass of the city shall be thorough, Mr.
Filcher suggests that it will be well to
divide it Into districts. â¢ The Lakeport
Bcerd of Trade has taken preliminary
tteps to affiliate with the State Board of
Trade, which is one outcome of the
present movement.
T. C. Friedlander. secretary of the Mer
chants' Exchange, has been' named by
that body to be a member of the promo
tion committee that will act with .the
State Board of Trade to Induce immigra
tion to the counties north of Tehachapl.
This appointment completes the repre
sentation of the commercial bodies of this
city on the committee, and, as the State
Beard of Trade has already appointed
five of its own members to serve, there
are only five members needed from the
Interior counties to give the promotion
cemmittee its entire membership. J. A.
Barr of Stockton has consented to serve
temporarily as a representative of the
Ban Joaquin Valley until an appointment
can be regularly made. Mr. Barr is very
, active as a member of the Stockton
Chamber of Commerce. It- is probable
that the first* meeting of the promotion
committee will be held in this city at the
rooms of the State Board of Trade next
Saturday afternoon. R. P. Jennings
represents the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce; A. A. Watklns the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade; Andrea Sbarboro

took a pair of horses to the blacksmith'^

about to enter the shop he pulled on the
lines to stop the speed of the animals
when one of them kicked, striking Link
on the forehead. The man was removed
to the Emergency Hospital, 'where Dr.
Armistead diagnosed his injuries to be a

DEATH WAS. ACCIDENTAL
Coroner's Jury Asks Board of Health
to Becommend Use of Less
"Â¦ Poisonous Gas.
In the case of the death of Mrs. Amelia
Timmerman,-* who . 'was accidentally
asphyxiated , in' her room -at 504 ITaylor
street, 5 a Coroner's jury yesterday brought
in a verdict of accidental death and added
the following recommendation: -
In view of the fact . that so many accidental
deaths have occurred recently from the Inhal
ation of illuminating gras, we,- the Jury, recom
mend, that the chemist of the Board of Health
bo requested . to have an analysis made of | the
gas at present Â¦ being furnished Â¦ customers I of
this city -with. the view, of determining whether
a less poisonous gas may not bs produced. .
Coroner Leland suggested" that lodging
house keepers -were, sometimes responsi
ble for the , accidental deaths from gas
asphyxiation, owing to the habit of turn
ing off the gas:a-t the meter at 12 or.l
o'clock in the morning and turning It on
again -at< 6 ''o'clock Â¦ to< enable _ thelr^ early
r isers7 to , dress. , Â¦ Thus lodgers j who go to
sleep â¢ with the * gas lighted ,' never awake
unless they - are lucky enough to ' be 'Â¦ out
of bed before 6,-ln which case they light

The next affidavit is by John W. White,
auditor. Mr. White swears that the en
tire gr%ss income of the Santa Fe Pacific
Railroad Company for the year ended
June 30, 1901, was $1,927.326 30; the ex
penditures, cost of operation, equipment,
etc., $1,402,777 13; fixed charges, rents,
taxes, etc., for the same period, $24S,
367 77; net revenue $276,745 55. It Is averred
that no separate account of the local
business has been kept and that no rail
road company doing through interstate
and local business ever keeps or attempts
to keep the cost of doing local business
separate from the cost of doing all tho
business. It Is- averred further that the
Railroad Commissioners have never re
quired such accounts to be kept. -
A. G. Wells, general manager of the
Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company,
swears that since July 1, 1897, that com
pany and the Southern California Rail
way Company have been operated as sep
arate and distinct corporations, each of
these v forming part of the Atchison sys
tem and having the same general offi
cers. The accounts of the earnings and
expenses of each are kept separate and
distinct from each of the others.
G. Holterhoff, treasurer and assistant
secretary of the Banta Fe Pacific Rail
road Company, deposed that that cor
poration pays $218,133 per annum for the
lease of the line of railroad from the Col
orado River to Mojave, and is required to
keep It In good condition and to pay all
the taxes and assessments. , On the line
from Mojave to Kern Junction $80,000 per
annum Is paid as rental, plus half tho
cost of maintenance and half the taxes.
Between Kern Junction and Bakersfleld
an annual rental is paid of $4659 32. The
SLfHdavlt states the total product. of crude
petroleum from Whlttler and Puente in
Los Angeles County and from Fullerton
in Orange County waÂ« 2,250,000 pounds for
last year.
The cases were set for hearing for
Thursday of this week at 10 a. m.
In the Interstate commerce, sugar rate
cases -ninety days further time was al
lowed from March 2L r" Â¦'- . ' â¢
The affidavit of Edward Chambers, ge.n
eral freight 'agent with the Atchison, To
peka 'and Santa Fe, avers that that cor^
poration does not now own and never has
owned any of the property of the Santa
Fe Pacific nor of the Southern Califor
nia Railway Company, and that it has
not operated and does not operate either
of those two lines. It is averred further
for the' purpose of making one of the is
sues clearer, that the crude petroleum
produced at Bakersfleld weighs seven and
three-quarter pounds to the gallon, that
there are forty-two gallons to the barrel
and that there are 6.U barrels to the ton.
It is further deposed that . the rates
charged by the petitioning companies had
not-been objected to by the Board of Rail
road Commissioners and had not been
modified or changed by them in any way.
and that therefore those rates had re
ceived the tacit assent of the board.
A batch of affidavits were filed yester
day in the United States Circuit Court on
behalf of the plaintiffs in the oil rate
cases. . They are by officers of the three
companies, the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad
Company and the Southern California
Railroad Company to restrain the Board
of Railroad Commissioners from enforc
ing the proposed schedule of rates for
transporting petroleum within the limits
of the State of California.
Goolishambarrow said further that he
spent some days in the oil fields in Texas
and particularly at Beaumont. The great
gushers there astonished him. by their ac
tivity and he predicted that the flow of
oil there would - continue for years to
come. He Â» will leave the city Thursday
for . Pittsburg, in the vicinity of which
He the Pennsylvania oil fields. ; After In
specting , these he will depart for St.
Petersburg, where he expects to arrive
within four weeks.
The distinguished expert wears the dec
oration of the \ Legion of Honor and pos
sesses . several medals awarded in Euro
pean centers for his works on "The Uni
versal Industry," numbering forty-three
volumes. Chief among . these is a gold
medal presented . to him by. the Russian
Geographical Society for writing this
fereat work. He Is the recipient of con
siderable attention' by loteal business men.
all of whom realize that his visit cannot
fail to be of profit to the coast because
of the advertising that will follow the
publication . of his report in his native
land. ,
"I have Inspected many samples of Cali
fornia oil since arriving in the State and'
find it of an excellent marketable quality.
The oil, however, contains too much as
phaltum to render its use as an llluminant
profitable. For fuel purposes it cannot
i>e excelled anywhere. The California oil
Meld is an extensive one and the yield will
be something: enormous in the course of
a few years if the fields are properly de
veloped. The prospects are excellent and
1 have no doubt the boring for oil will in
a short time be one of the great Industries
of your State."
Goolishambarrow is gathering statistics
relative to the oil industry of this country
for his Government. Although this is his
third visit to the United States he has
never had. an opportunity of Inspecting
the oil fields. He is accompanied by his
wife, who acts as his interpreter. When
seen at a downtown hotel last night Gool
ishambarrow said:
A Russian author of distinction and " an
oil expert of International prominence in
the person of Stephen Goolishambarrow
ls in the citv on a mission for the Rus
sian Government. Goolishambarrow is an
attache of . the Russian Finance Depart
ment and an official whose advice the
Czar, in matters of industrial development
of the empire, has not disdained 'to ac
cept on more than one occasion. . In the
field of political economy of Russia Gool

second to none in Europe. - . * "

DANGEROUS SURGERY
Should Be the Last Resort.
Many people suffer from piles because
after trying various lotions, salves and
ointments without relief or cure they
come to the conclusion that a surgical
operation is the last resort, and rather '
than submit to the shock and risk to life
of an operation prefer to suffer on; very
often, however, the afflicted one is over-
persuaded to resort to the knife, and even
though the operation is apparently cue-'
cessful and theye is complete recovery
from the shock incident thereto the result
is invariably the same â the piles sooner or
later return, because their -cause has not
been removed. This result is a logical
one. Inasmuch as the knife removes the
effects of the disease only, while the
cause remains as before. There is claimed
to be a remedy which does remove the
cause, hence eradicating: the disease, and
that Is the Pyramid Pile Cure. It is in
the form of a suppository. 1b applied di-
rectly to the parts affected and- brings
about a complete cure, quietly and pain-
lessly. In this connection the testimony
of Mr. John Cullen Bryant, the well-
known bookseller of Haverhill, Mass., is
of unusual interest. â¢
("I desire to contribute an unsolicited
but purely voluntary testimonial in favor
of Pyramid Pile Cure. I have suffered for
more than twenty years with hemor-
rhoids, and have consulted numerous phy-
sicians and have expended a great deal
of money for medicines that did me no
pood. I had often seen Pyramid Pile Cure
advertised, but hesitated for months be-
fore buying same, thinking it a patent or
quack remedy that had no merit;' but
having: tried every other remedy pre-
scribed I was finally persuaded one year
ago to try Pyramid Pile Cure. I bought
a 50-cent package at the drugstore, Â¦ and
while I may not be permanently cured,
the past year has been the only year of
my life worth living during the past
twenty years, apd nothing but the Pyr-
amid remedies have wrought this change.
I offer this testimony for the benefit of
suffering humanity." HgMB??Ctf'

A FEW OF THE MANY, OLYMPIC CLUB ATHLETES WHO HAV.E
GIVEN UP OTHER SPORTS FOR THE VERY GENTLE INDOOR
PASTIME; CALLED "PING PONG." ; v i â¢':
rpk INGPONG 1 beats .tag all hollow."
1 )j said Garnet Ferguson at the '
j-^ Olympic Club yesterday. "Yes, .
il It is wildly exciting," replied i
Fred Butz, "but I fear it is in
jurious to the oblongata and -I'm afraid â¢
I'll have to give it up."
The game of VPlng Pong," or indoor,
tennis, has a firm hold on the Olympic ,
Club athletes.. Devotees of handball have j
found that game too strenuous and are
taking up the pastime with avidity. Al
Hampton, the champion ofthe coast, can
wield a; racket with grace and skill and,
Is willing to challenge the champion of
the world at the game. "Bill" Cartwright,"
better known as "eddicated," issued a
challenge to the champion. Cartwright
wants to play Hampton for money or
marbles on condition that he is allowed to
use a monkey-wrench. Judge Daniels
would rather play "Ping Pong." than 1 ap
point a Justices' clerk. Â¦ Jack Gleason
thinks the game more exciting than golf
and Phil Wand Is gaining muscle wield
ing the racket.
Sammy Bereer sets himself -up as in
structor of the game. While teaching
Johnny Hammersmith the finer points
yesterday, he said: "Instead of using an
uppercut, you must handle .the. racket
in a gingerly manner. Do not swear audi-
Rosie Hoeckner, a woman who was will
ing to let her age go as 30 years, is tbe
complaining witness. According to her
Story she met Ladeur a few months ago
at her home in Sheboygan, WIs., whera
she made a living as a dressmaker. 1
Ladeur had come to town as one of th,8 '
features in a traveling circus and earned
the plaudits of his audiences by a clever
contortion and juggling act. It was a
case of love at first sight and Ladeur de
cided to sever his connection with the
show when he learned that the woman
was smitten and Incidentally that she had
a fat bank account ln Chicago. It was
all business with the acrobat, and after
a hard talk he had the country dress
maker draw $1500 from the bank and
place it in his charge. .
The pair came to this city last Decem
ber, but after a day or two he proposed to
leave his sweetheart for a while that he
might go to Chicago to get a trunk full
of circus tricks which he had forgotten.
Since his departure he has sent on money,
(sometimes as much -as $5 per letter, to
his love, and never once, he says, did ho
forget his promise of marriage.
He returned to this city last evening
and was arrested. When searched Ladeur
reluctantly delivered up nearly $lÂ»0 in
bills.. After being placed behind the bars
the man said that his arrest was the re
sult of his sweetheart's attorney's desire
to get a case. "I am willing to marry
her," he said, "and give her what money
I have belonging to .herâ that Is after -I
take out $500 for expenses incurred In
our trip to this city and which she agreed
to pay for.
"If Rosie is willing," he said, as the cell
door closed, behind him, "I will marry her
ln the morning, when I get out of jail, and
save her as much as I can ln attorney's
fees." Â¦â¢ ' ;

Jim Corbett has Instructed his brother
Harry to use hia endeavors to get on a
match for him. with Jeffries. Brother
Harry has an appointment with Billy De
laney, Jeffries' trainer, to-day and the
two will . talk over the proposed contest.
Harryi Corbett stated last night that Jim's
theatrical engagements would not permit
him to take on the champion until the
latter, part of August. Harry said if Jef
ries and i Jim make a match, his brother
will break his contracts and . come West
and get into condition. Corbett out
pointed Jeffries for twenty-three rounds,
two years ago and many Calif ornians
would like to see the famous boxer try
his skill against the present champion.
The bout between Corbett and Jeffries
would attract more attention ln this State
than a contest between Fitzsimmona and
the boilermaker.
Corbett and Jeffries.
Immediately after the exhibition last
Friday night Smith made Levy live up to
his promise. He compelled Levy to turn
over $500 to him and his associates and
they went off laughing at Manager Levy's
inexperience. It is now- stated on good
authority that the National Club is try
ing to get a "rake-off" from the Yosemite
Club, but Harry Corbett intends to block
the scheme.- .
The Board of Supervisors was yester
day enjoined from giving a permit to the
Yosemite Athletic Club to hold a contest
next month in this city. The writ was
made returnable Friday and the matter
will come up before Judge Seawell. Upon
receipt, of the service of the writ the Su
pervisors withheld the permit for April
j and left the matter to the joint Commit
tee on Judiciary and Police.
The National Club is headed by Mike
Smith, the, politician. The latter and a
few more of his kind have endeavored to
bfeak into the fighting . game, but have
been blocked by the Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors. The National
Club has applleu repeatedly during tne
last few months for permits to bring off
contests, but has not succeeded In Bet
ting them. Last month the Police Com
mittee recommended that this club be al
lowed to hold a fight in March. Â¦ This
privilege .. was denied them, however.
When the matter came up before the
Board of Supervisors, sitting as a whole,
the permit was given to the Hayes Valley
Athletic Club. Mike Smith and his crowd
"raised a howl": and threatened all kinds
of proceedings against the more fortunate
club. In the end Smith and his associates
succeeded in scaring Morris Levy into a
promise that he would give them 10 per
â¢cent of the gross receipts on condition
that they give the Hayes Valley Club no
trouble. 1 , . > Â¦

RESULTS OF MONDAY'S RAGING AT THE OAKLANDTRACK

Pavement^Eulij of -Holes, En
dangering Both Horses .,.-. 'I.
and Drivera
A vigorous complaint is being made by
the majority of the horsemen of this city,
at the ' deplorable condition of Golden
Gate aver.ue 1 . Most of those who are loud
in complaints own their own horses and
buggies and they claim that the street is
in such a bad condition that it is not safe
to drive a horse even at a walk up the
avenue.
The bitumen pavement lifts in great
mounds In some places and in spots there
are large holes that endanger the springs
of even. a rubber- tired buggy when driven
at a slow trot. A petition Is being cir
culated and signed by many of the dri
vers, called the' attention of the Com
missioners of the Board of Pubiic Works
to the condition of the avenue. The worst
places on the avenue are in the block
running from Jones to Leavenworth.
Another comolalnt the drivers have Is
that Golden Gate avenue is ln a very un
clean condition and that in the history
of any administration of the . Board of
Public Works the avenue was never in
a filthier condition. This they claim is
all owing to the pavement not being
Â¦wept. often enough. At this time of the
year large numbers of tourists are in the
â¢city and one of the chief attractions is
a drive to Golden Gate Park and the
beach, via Golden Gate avenue. $Vith the
street in its present condition the Eastern
visitors will form a poor opinion of the
government of this city and it Is predicted
by horsemen that the moment that their
petition is presented It will have the de
eired effect. -.*Â¦"< Â¦ y

Â¦25 to 1 against 'the lightweight Janice
from Green Morris'- stable carried equal
weights I with Position, < and so positive
were" the /majority ' of bettors that the
mare would win that they quickly
snapped up all the 3 to 5 laid about her.
Knapp got Frangible away _ first, and,
despite all of Lee Jackson's hard work in
a fruitless attempt -to get up with the
favorite, the long shot won by a length,
ridden out. Position took show honors
from Colonel Ballantyne.
Master ICnapp received a generous re
ception from the crowd, with whom he is
a big favorite, for his excellent ride.
With two exceptions the favorites fared
badly, and the 14 bookmakers gathered in
all of the loose coin floating about. The
card was above the, average, attracting a
large gathering of turfgoers.
Almost any one of the' 11 starters in the
opening 514-furlong spring seemingly pos
sessed some sort of. a chance. So open
did Ut look that Loving Cup, the favorite,
closed at 3. The winner turned up in Isa-

The prices on everything -with- the ex
ception of Waterscratch were -marked up
in the speculating on the six and. a half
furlong selling number. The Watercress,
three-year-old caught all J:he smart play,
and with Hoar and ninety-eight pounds
on his back registered at the wire an easy
winner over Bragg, the. outsider of the
five starters. Dan Hanlon's old mare Sly
for a time showed the way, but could not
keep the lick up, running third. Duckoy.

too hard, and Quiet was wretchedly

Pomona Times:
The night following his address in Stockton
William E. Smythe president of the State Con.
Ktructive League, delivered a lecture in Sacra
mento. In the course of his address Mr.
fcmythe made ! a sharp attack on Governor
Gage. (ThÂ«? Governor's veto of the bill ap
propriatlnK $100,000 for the investigation of
facts relating to the construction ot water
etorage reservoirs and the further developmtnt
of irrigation was denominated as calamitous
to the State. The speaker ridiculed the Gov
ernor's pretensions to economy, and eald that
while the Governor had vetoed the bill osten
sibly on the score of economy and claimed to
have saved the State $100,000, in reality the
commonwealth had lost $20,000,000 in ths po
tential value of flood waters which could have
been stored. In concluding his arraignment of
the Governor Mr. Smythe said: "Here in this
city of the capitol I denounce the veto of that
bill- as a cruel affront to the noblest aspira
tions cf California, and as a blow aimed at
the heart of her.future gTeatness and power."
Stockton Record:
The Republican party In this State must

Governor Gage continues to do "push" pol

Wants to Know Who Pays Rent.
A special session of the Board of Edu
cation was held last night to consider the
financial needs of the department, Tho
congested condition of the schools was
considered, but no definite results were
reached. Some discuffslon was brought
about when the rent delinquency of Max
Popper In regard to the PoÂ«t street'Ham
mam baths, on Post street, between Grant
avenue and Dupont street, was consid
ered. Secretary Hansen was ordered to
collate the resolutions of previous
boards, and the matter will then be sub
mitted to the City and County Attorney.
Colonel D. M.. Burns, In a recent interview,
while confessing an estrangement between him
self and Crlmmlns, on account of a quarrel over
the spoils, Insisted that he was still as close as
ever to Herrin. These little personal facts are
regarded as news, worth paying telegraph tolls
on. Why? Who is W. F. Herrin? He is a
pleasant and intelligent gentleman, â¢ who Is
hired by the Southern Faclflp to do politics for
the railroad. In his personal capacity he is
nothing, represents nothing, aspires to nothing.
He is the living embodiment of the Southern
Pacific in politics and makes no pretense, and
asks no pretense, that he stands for anything
else. Now the Southern Pacific Is a most use
ful railroad corporation, which has rendered
vast business service to California, at much in
cidental profit to Itself. As such it Is entitled
to receive, and does receive, all due business
and public consideration. But the Southern
Pacific Is not a citizen of California and has no
business in the politics of California. A citizen
may engage in politics for good or for evil, but
the Intrusion of a corporation into politics for
any purpose whatever -^ is an unmixed public
evil, and quite the most pronounced political
evil of our day. What shall we think, then, of
the political leader who frankly avows partner
ship with this political Influence? Wtyit shall
we think of any candidate for office who at
taches himself to that leader's fortunes and
suffers his control? Just what we think of the
power behind the throne that they all Indirectly
represent. The Issue is drawn, fortunately,
with entire distinctness In California. There is
no compromising it or mistaking* It. The trail
of the boss is plain. Beware of those that fol
low therein.

After buying the Post, Walter F." X. Parker
keeper of the exchequer of the machine, made
his way down the coast, stopping at various
towns along the way and purchasing such edi

papers were bought outright and new men
placed on the tripod to do the shouting. for the
ring. In Los Angeles, in their efforts to con
trovert the effects of the organization ot a
Spanish-American Flint club, the support was
obtained of El Monitor, the local Mexican
sheet, which appeared yesterday with an edi
torial favoring the renomination of Gage. Sen

among the Mexicans, and the defection of El

Another paper that has been purchased Â».y
the Gage gang Is the Pomona Review, formerly
a Democratic sheet. The price paid for tiu na

ton of North Ontario having been engaurd an
editor. This will be the only Gage paper In

renomination.
Antagonized by the principal newspapers of
the State, the ring has found it necessary to
buy organs of its own, or to subsidize those
that were for sale. The San Francisco Post
was the first to be purchased outright by the
Gage managers, and with its uncertain circula
tion and nugatory. Influence was transferred
from Its former owners, the Southern Pacific, to
the Dan Burns machine.
Los Angeles Times:
The purse strings have been loosened by the
managers of the Gage campaign, and into every
part of the State the golden 6tream Is flowing
from the bubonic plague appropriation, from
the coffers of the railroad and from the funds
that have been gathered In by the devious
workings of the machine. Money Is what talks
now. and Its" subtle Influence is expected to ex
pand until the coming of the State Convention. '
Of course there has been no cessation in the
dealing out of plums when ripe, as witness the
appointment of Boss "Johnnie" Mackenzie of
San Jose to the position of Harbor Commis
sioner at a salary of $4000 per year, but there
is little of this kind of fruit to distribute at
present, and it is money only that can make
itself heard.
Again the clean Republican* of California
find themselves pitted .against Dan Burns and
Governor Gage, Just as they were in the Sena
torial contest. The success of ' Gage would
mean four years more of Burns in the admin
istration of the political affairs of the State.

Palo Alto Times:
Governor Gasre evidently realizes that he is
liable to have Santa Clara County opposed to
him for renomination. and he has been trying
to square affairs and bold the different factions
In line. On Saturday he appointed John D.
Mackenzie Harbor Commissioner, and to make
things right with the Rea element appointed
James W. Rea & Director of State Agricultural
District No. S (SantP- Clara and San Mateo
counties). F. W. Covey of Palo Alto was
also made a - director of the game district. It
is doubtful whether this recognition of the
Rea faction will give the county to Mr. Gage,
as there ts strong opposition to giving him
another term as Governor.

Santa Clara Journal:
John D. Mackenzie has been appointed Har
bor Commissioner by Governor Gage. Macken
zie is known as the petty political boss of Santa
Clara County. If he has ever done a service
to this State that warrants Governor Gage ap
pointing him to that important position there
are very few people in Santa Clara County that
know of the fact. We do not believe ihat lhe
appointment will help the re-election of Gov
ernor Gage next fall. There is much bitter op
position to such an appointment.
Santa Ana Herald:
The Republican party of California should
not be forced to go into the coming State cam
paign with an irreconcilable split in its ranks
merely to satisfy the cravings of the machine
politicians. There is no reason why the party
should not be eminently successful at the pells
next November, with a â¢ candidate who wouM
unite rather than divide its strength.
Governor Gage's new appointment as a mem
ber of the Harbor Commission, John D. Mac
kenzie, represents, about- everything which Is
nefarious and corrupt In politics. MacKenzle
has been greedy -for office, and has generally
had some appointive office from the State, and
Â¦was generally sorry that he could not hold
Several offices at once.
Governor Gage has at last Intimated that
he will be a : candidate for re-election if the
people desire it, and says that what is satis
factory to the people will pleare him. He also
alludes to a supposed popular demand for his
re-election; Possibly somebody has misinform
ed the Governor, for there certainly Is not
much clamor among the people in his behalf.
No doubt he bases his opinion upon the ex
pressions of the political machine manager?.
Grass Valley Union:
Visalia Daily Times: /
A few weeks ago Governor Gage appointed
one of the old-time railroad bosses Bank Com
missioner to succeed John Markley, and on
Saturday last John D. Mackenzie, a Santa
Clara County boss, was made Harbor Com
missioner. In order to show his complete con
tempt for the people, he then appointed James
W. Rea, another boss, a Director of Agrlcul-_
tural District No. 5. The decent Republicans
of Santa Clara County are in rebellion against
the domination of Rea and Mackenzie, and this
recognition of those bosses by the Governor
shows that he proposes to rely entirely upon
the machine for his nomination. If Burns
and Herrln succeed in renominating Gage,
there should be no difficulty in defeating him
la November.

to locate, as the quarters In which It

but none seemed to meet th requirements,
but recently the firm of Pasquale & Sons,
which occupies a. portion of the building

decided to take that space. This will

Napa Daily Register:
John D. Mackenzie has been appointed by
Governor Gago to the office of Harbor Com
missioner in San Francisco, vice Rudolph Her
rold. resigned. According to newspaper knowl
edge, San Jose has two political bosses â Mac
kenzie and Rea â one on each end of the po
litical teeter. Between Mackenzie and Colonel
Burn* and Attorney Ilerrln (head of "the ma
chine" in San Francisco), a strong bond of
union Is said to exist, and on the recommenda
tion of these gentlemen the appointment was
probably made.
The only justification the Governor gives for
this and similar appointments is the strange
assertion that the people believe in boss rule
and favor the control of politics by corporation
hirelings, and that the only opposition to this
course Is actuated " by the personal prejudice
of the proprietors of the morning newspapers
of the. State. There may come a chance, at
some primary elections before long, to show
the Governor that the people as well as ths
newspapers have a few prejudices in favor of
decent politics.
The appointment Saturday by Governor Gage
of John D. Mackenzie of San Jose as Harbor
Commissioner Is a particularly defiant refusal
on the part of the Governor to be guided by
public sentiment or a decent regard for the
public Interest. San Jose has been the worst
boss-ridden of the Interior cities. John D. Mac
kenzie, as accredited boss of that city, â¢ has
stood for everything that demoralizes. and cor
rupts municipal, local and State politics. His
record in San Jose is so notorious that no man
in California can be Ignorant of it, least of all
the Governor of the State. As a member of
Governor Gage's administration he has ah-eacly
been the willing' tool of perhaps 1 the most. lÂ»a
grant abuse of patronage that has character
ized that administration, for it was by his ap
pointment as one of the Trustees of the School
for the Feeble Minded that the removul of an
experienced and expert superintendent, 'to
make room for an Incompetent political hench
man, was brought about. Having thus shown
what he will do in an office which has patron
age but no salary, : he is now given an oppor
tunity to show what he can do in an ! office
that has both patronage and salary. The pa
tronage of the San Francisco water front has
been a notorious means of political corruption..
To put it Into the hands of a professional po-'
lltlcal corruptionlst is to invite and expect^it
to be used in this way.
Fresno Republican:
â¢ Â¦ Â¦ j
tion is a direct insult to every reputable resi
dent of California.
Senator Currier's opposition to Gage is based
on causes". which should induce every good citi
zen of the State to oppose him. '
So this story as to Senator Currier Is al
most without truth In any way and without
tho semblance of truth so far as his, opposition
to Gage goes. It Is easy to understand Â¦Â¦Â¦ why
many' small, disreputable politicians will create
and publish euch a baseless story, but It Is not
easy to understand how reputable papers like
the Riverside Press and Pasadena Star would
do it. Then think of Dan Hums being the
purveyor of State patronage â the great "I am"
that Bays who shall and who Â«ihall not be per
mitted to earn the State's irioney. â¢
'Now for the sequel: The petitioner was told
by the Governor, or some one for him, that
Dart Â¦ Burns â¢ in San Francisco had â¢ the giving
out of such employment. . He went , to San
Francisco and found a long line, of applicants
taking their turn for an audience with, the
great Burns for State employment, and after
he- did see the great man, this dispenser of State
patronage, he was told that the matter would be
attended to later at Sacramento/but he didn't
get work at the capitol grounds nor anywhere
elso for the State at that time, if ever.
I A couple of years ago. more or less, v a
nephew of Senator Currier by marriage.' and
whom he had never before seen, circulated a
petition at Sacramento containing a request
that^he.be given employment on the capitol
grounds, not a very "responsible position' 1 nor
â¢'ina.State Institution." - . ' ..-Â¦Â¦Â¦
Such reputable papers as . the Pasadena Star
and Riverside Press have republlshed this
petty, untruthful Btory. The Gage papers
ought to be very careful about aspersing Â¦ the
character of honorable men. As to the above
story, it probably originated in this fact.:-. ' Â¦'
not appoint one of Currier's near relatives to a
responsible position in a State institution."
Judge Cabaniss, in giving his Instruc
tions to the Jurors, paid particular atten
tion to Partridge's contention that the
slaughter of this particular elk was not a
violation of the law. He stated that the
point was new to him. but that in the
little time he had had for consideration
he had arrived at the conclusion that the
killing of the elk was contrary to law.
Considering the fact that Kohn con
fessed that he had had the carcass of the
tt&A elk in his keeping, the findings of
'he jury could scarcely have been other
wise. In arguing for the defense. Attor
ney Partridge brought up a very unique
point of law. He contended that the slain
antlered monarch of the park had been
born in captivity and therefore thÂ«
slaughter could not be termed a violation
cf the State game laws, which are in
tended only to protect the wild game of
the forest. He claimed that part owner
ship in the progenitors of the dead elk
became absolute ownership in the off
spring. He argued that this elk had
vicious propensities, that it was continu
ally wandering about the paddock, iike
an untamed beast of prey, looking for In
nocent creatures to devour.
A Ju-y cf twelve good and true men,
after <iue deliberation, brought in a ver
dict yesterday afternoon in Judge Caba

grulltr of having had a dead elk J In his
possession. The finding did not ruffle the
complacency of Kohn's dlsposiUon, espe

The Tai Wah Lottery' Company, which

war. It accuses some Chinese, whose
name Is yet unknown to the police, of
having stolen a ticket which drew a $4000
prize and of presenting the same for pay

officers of the company the ticket was
not sold and belonged to them. Its value
was $2. After the result of the drawing
had been announced the ticket was stolen
from their office and a collection on it at

rightfully belongs to him and the Six

INFLUENTIAL newspapers of the State continue to comment freely on Governor Gage's, utter
subserviency to the bosses. It is perfectly. clear t6 the impartial observer that the Governor has
surrendered the administration of State affairs to tlie gang that runs the "machine." It is also
clear that Gage is losing ground. Thousands of stanch Republicans were foremost in fighting
his battle for election hi 1898 openly assert that his defeat at the polls would' be the result of his '
renomination. The chief demand for his indorsement for another term comes from the camp of|
followers of the administration â the office holders,' deputies and lounders who are draining susten
ance from the public treasury in accordance with orders from the bosses. The merchants, working
men, farmers and others connected with industrial pursuits are satisfied to let him rest with one;
term. The belief that Gage will be defeated if renominated is widespread. His alliance with the
notorious bosses of his own party and his fellowship with the worst elements of the. Democratic
camp has. aroused the people to a sense of public danger! The following comments from the press
of the State are timely and readable. .. *
Red Bluff Sentinel:
Governor Gagre has again betrayed himself
and the Republican party Into the hands of
the bosses by the appointment of that noto
rious boss, Johnny Mackenzie of San Jose, as
Harbor Commissioner In San Francisco. It
Fhould be remembered up and down the State
that Gage appointed this same Mackenzie as a
trustee ot the Home for the Feeble Minded at
Glen Eller.. consummating the most damnable
piece of political dirty work In the history of
the Staie in the removal of Dr. Osborn, who
had be.rn at the head of that institution since
it was established. Democratic executives
recognized his eminent fitness and high char
acter In the care of the unfortunate wards of
the State, and it remained for boss-ridden
Gape to bring about this shameful result. It
is high time for Republicans throughout the
State who believe In decency in politics to
unite on some good man, whether it is Edson.
Pardee, Flint. Preston or some one else, to de
feat Gage. The tatter's nomination will mean
his defeat and the entire State ticket will be
in danger. There should be a united opposi
tion, or Gage and boss politics will bring de
feat to the party.

women to try iLydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
By experience I found it a most valuable remedy.for the peculiar ail-

been cured, and very recently a dear friend of mine who has tried a
number oÂ£ physician's prescriptions without relief gave up in despair,
when Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was suggested to
her. It was her last hope, but it proved a Godsend to her 1 â just the
â¢right, medicine for me, she says â now she is cured and just the right
medicine for every sick woman say I â try it and you will find it will
cure you in very short time." â Mrs. Helen Farrell.

TO. PRESERVE FLOWERSâ Reader,
Oakland. Cal. The following method for
preserving the natural color of flowers is
recommended by . R. Hegler in tho
"Deutsche Botanlsche Monatsnefte." It
consists in dusting salicylic acid on the
flowers as they He in the press, and re
moving it again with a brush when tho
flowers are dry. Red colors in particular
are well preserved by. this agent. An
other method of applying the same pre
servative is to use a solution of one part
of salicylic acid to fourteen of alcohol by
means of blotting paper or cotton wool
placed below and above the flowers. Pow
dered boraclc acid 3 r lelds' nearly as good
results. Dr. Schonland in the Gardener'3
Chronicle recommends as an improvement
in the method of using sulphurous acid
for preserving the color that in the case
of delicate flowers they might be placed
loosely between sheets of vegetable parch
ment before immersion in the liquid, so Â«Qt>
to preserve their natural form. â¢?;

In explaining why the German Government would

order of, the Chinese Government and Germany
would lose prestige, and; finally, "the instruments
ought now to be placed in the category of presents
from Government to Government, as has been cus
tomary." It will be seen from this that when once

self that the loot should be' looked upon as a gift. â¢

A further influence . emanates from our philan
thropy. The famine, fund. which, was raised in this
country in 1001 and J to which President 'McKinley
and Secretary Hay were contributors, served not only
to relieve suffering at the time, but to excite among
the people a feeling of confidence in American friend
liness that has been; helpful in promoting our trade.
Another factor in the situation that counts in our.
favor is said to be the manner in which our diplo
macy is carried on. The report says: "It is char
acteristic of the Minister and Consuls of, the United
States that they hold themselves in readiness, to. ex
tend their good offices with ungrudging magnanimity
to the merchant, the missionary, the journalist, with'
out distinction of .class or country. In receiving or
assisting their fellow countrymen there is no as
sumption of lordly mannerism.'* ' ' . " V
The Chinese are reported to have noted' with satis
faction the difference between our methods;and those
of other nations. They perceive that our. aim is to
expand our trade with the empire not by the use of
"guns and grab," but by cultivating thV good will 'of
the people and supplying them with; tire merchandise
they need. '.They quote with gratification the recent
statement of an American official: "We seek trade,
not territory; we do not mean to fight, but to foster
friendliness. We mean to conquer China by mer
cantile, not by military means. Our merchants will
exploit her markets, and without armies we shall
win." . ' , â¢ .- '. \ .. . . ' .'â¢ â¢
Under the influence of this favorable feeling among
the Chinese our trade 13 -showing a handsome de
velopment. During the last few years" there- has
been. a large increase in the Chinese consumption of
American iron, oil, calico and flour; and it is added:
"The demand has exece'ded the supply. Preparations
are now being made for quicker, transport, better
storage and more supplies.". '. : . ./ â¢ '
..'a CCORDING to the North China Herald.
Â¦ /\ ' American -influence in China is' as potent to
..*Â¦ A- day as that of the more aggressive nations,
and promises to be more lasting. It is founded upon
commerce and education instead of upon territorial
domination, and is winning favor among all classes
of progressive Chinese, so that in the end the com
petition for supremacy in the Chinese markets is like
ly" to terminate in our favor provided we can keep an
open market and prevent the virtual conquest of the

a wife for the Crown Prince of Germany and tfie
seeming difficulty of finding a proper one in Europe
may throw some light on the recent visit of Prince
Henry. It may be he came here, to take, a look at
American girls. It will be remembered that he com
mended the feminine loveliness he saw In Milwaukee,
and said- afterward that the emblem of America to
him hereafter would be the American Beauty rose.
BURIAL-Enq., City. There is no data
that will show when human bodies were
first buried in the earth. Abraham buried
Sarah at Macpelah, 1S60 B. C. Places of
burial were consecrated under Pope
Calixtus I in 210 A. D. The ancient
Greeks had burial places remote from
towns; the Romans had them near the
highways. The first Christian burial was.
it is said, in 596; burial in cities in 742;
In consecrated places in 750; in church
yards, 758.
INITIALSâ G. L. A., City. When a
woman marries she assumes her hus-^
band's name, and except in the case of
lagal documents, where she must sign her
given name as well as her name by mar
riage. For instance, a woman has tha
given name of Mary and marries Charles
William Smitt, she would use Mrs.
Charles William Smitt, not Mrs. Mary
Smitt, on her cards: so in using a seal to
seal letters it would be right to use the
initials C. W. S.
BASEBALL-M.. San Martin. Cal. One
who has been a manager of a baseball
team says that the only way "to bind the
players to mind the manager" is to make
the players put up a certain amount at
the time of the signing cf the contract
so that fines imposed may be taken out.
The manager has the control-Af the busi
ness end for the, team and captain the

If the Massachusetts bill become a law its opera
tion will be keenly studied by economists, as the most
interesting experiment that has ever been tried in.
any country.
In all of its aspects such a departure is distinctly
revolutionary. It effectually transfers property from
the protection of the law to that of organization
which does not own :"t, but has the power to limit or
destroy its '.^se.
We have said, understanding^-, that this Ms the end
sought by the wise leaders of organization, who real
ize that success depends upon force and not persua
sion. We think that' it is now apparent that their
wisdom will be justified by success. And what then?
A power that so entirely cuts to the root of things
. must profoundly affect industrial affairs. It will de
cide the fate of all investments, will revolutionize the
law of common carriers, utterly change the relations
of emplo3'e and employer, extirpate productive com
petition and determine the cost of production. The
power to do all this is not inherent in government.
Those who exercise it will be above the restraint of
the law. The only curb upon them will be economic
principles. The final effect upon the country will be
determined by the degree of knowledge of those prin
ciples ha3 by the men who lead.
The labor problem, as presented to organization
for solution, has but few and simple features. The
progressive increase in wages depends upon the
power to make labor scarce. This can be done by
limiting or denying apprenticeship, limiting the mem
bership of organization and denying the right of un
organized labor to work at all. The proposed Massa
chusetts statute accomplishes this completely. It af
fects the great purpose of organization by removing
from property judicial protection through injunction.
It elevates organization to the first place, legalizes its
use of force and indeed makes it the. sole, controlling
industrial factor,
The wise and forcible leaders of labor in this coun
try liave given but HttleVcountenance td the pretense "
that a strike is' a peaceful thing, to be won by bland
and amicable means. The^rights they seek to main
tain aad magnify are of that class which must be
won and held by force, and to protect the means re
quired their use must be made free of legal restraint.
When organization can control, absolutely, the labor
supply, it will control the country and dictate its
policy. This prospect may not please the thoughtful
citizen, but let him reflect that, given such oppor
tunity, with such a prize in reach, men who do and
dare are sure to" improve the one in order to grasp
the other. . ! ~>
ry-Â»HE New York Times notes with surprise that
I the Massachusetts Legislature is giving elab
â¢*Â¦ orate hearings on a bill to legalize the picketing
of any plant or property by strikers, and to exclude
from legal restraint any acts of such pickets to pre
vent other laborers seeking employment on the pick
eted plant or propert\\ While the consideration of
such a bill may cause surprise, it must be accepted as
an incident in the evolution of organization.

Big game can be photographed by these means. An elephant moving down
through the jungle to his habitual drinking place may tread upon a large con
cealed board, and the next instant will find him trying to "look pleasant" un
der what would be most trying circumstances. s â¢>' .â¢;':,â¢
In the near future, therefore, it is probable that both lawyers and naturalists
may have more cause than ever to thank the photographer.

ANEW terror is added to the alreaady overwhelming difficulties of an ener
getic section of professional merv-burglars.
By the mere act of entering a room, the -unhappy housebreaker can
now bo made to photograph himself from two or three points of view.
It is C. Kearton, a clever animal antl bird photographer of Chicago, who has
earned the heartfelt maledictions of the fraternity of the jimmy and dark lantern.
A reporter was invited by I\carton to go to his house and attempt to "burgle"
his premises. -The challenge was accepted. A certain window was to be left
unlatched and an entrance obtained through it. . \
All the lights were turned out as with stealthy tread the writer entered the
garden. Tho window rose noiselessly as ho opened it with caution.
All that the writer's dark lantern revealed were a dark interior, and, just
under the window ledge, a seat with an innocent looking cushion. Thinking him
self safe so far as the window seat was concerned, the burglar "for this occa
sion only" placed his foot inside the room.
His preparations got no further. The moment the slightest pressure was
placed upon the deceptive window seat a great flare of light leaped up and expired
as suddenly as it flashed. Â¦ , . . .â¢
For several minutes the amateur burglar could "see" nothing but Intense
blackness, and even when Kearton turned up the gas nothing could be distin
guished in the room owing to the tremendously dazzling effect of the flashlight.
The "burglar" having been duly trapped and photographed. Kearton went into
detailB with him. Under the window had been laid two poised pieces of board.
The lightest touch upon them brought two pieces of metal In contact, which
completed an electrical circuit. The current flowed along the wires that were
fixed to a battery. Above the battery was an electrical coll which discharged a
half-Inch spark. Round the sparkling terminals was a preparation of magnesium
powder, which' was ignited by the spark itself. ... ....Â¦ '
t Ori the table facing the window stood the camera which took the photograph
reproduced above, representing the reporter entering the'- ro<5njT from the front.
Another camera In the garden recorded the other photograph as he -was
silhouetted against the illuminated window- V--, -i< '.:"Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦;â¢Â¦.*- â¢Â¦ ~

CHEST WEIGHTSâ M.. San Martin.
Cal. Possibly you mean by the question
"how are chest weights produced?" how
chest expansion is produced. The modern
method is by the use of ejwrclsers that
may be obtained from any dealer in
sporting goods and from many dealers in
hardware. i ;
Some years ago when this change in the immi
gration-was first noted Dr. Francis A. Walker point
ed out that it threatened a congestion of the labor
market and the larger cities with a class of people
unfit for our standards of civilization and unequal to
the requirements of American citizenship. Even then
he said the time had come when "we" should take a
rest and give our social, political and industrial sys
tem some'ehance to recuperate. The problems which
so sternly confront us to-day are serious enough,
without being complicated and aggravated by the
addition of some millions of Hungarians, Bohemians,
Poles, South Italians and Russian Jews*." Â¦ .
: : The evils that were then threatening have now in
some localities been realized. A comprehensive and
well devised restriction act is therefore a matter of
urgency. Congress will do well to enact one at this
.session. 3&& %Â¦$$$&{ ,/: ,
The bill has been objected to in some quarters on
the ground that it is too drastic, but there is reason
to believe it will be approved by a majority of the
thoughtful people of the country. It is not denied
that good immigrants are a source of wealth to the
country and that much of the marvelous advance
and progress of the republic is\due to the large num
bers of industrious and energetic men and women
who have been coming to our shores from Europe
for years past. Still there has been of late such a
change in the character of the immigration' that it is
lime to subject it to a more careful supervision.
In addition to excluding anarchists the new meas
ure provides for thejexamination of cabin passengers
as well as steerage passengers, so undesirable persons
who happen to: have, money enough to travel first
class will be rejected as well as those who are poorer.
Among the- new classes of aliens who are to be ex
cluded arc epileptics and persons who- have been in
sane within five years previous to coming here, and
persons who have had two or more attacks orjnsan
ity at any time previous.. The' section relating to
contract labor is made more stringent, and now in
cludes persons who ;hayc been induced to come to
the United States by "offers, solicitations, promises
or agreements," and the section includes the words,
"those who import or attempt to import," which, it
is claimed, will catch the contractor, even if the la
borers are not landed. The bill also provides that in
spection shall be made from time to time of all re- !
formatories, insane hospitals, charitable institutions,
etc., and that all aliens who are there found. who have
become public charges under the law are to be de
ported. The standard of qualifications of examining
physicians is raised. /
[' In a recent statement on the subject Chairman
Shattuc of the Committee on Immigration and Natu
ralization said the new bill will increase the head tax
on alien immigrants from the $1 now imposed to
$1 50, so as" to provide money to meet the additional
expense of operating the new measure. An import
ant feature of the. proposed plan for better restriction
is that the bill. provides not only for rejecting unde
sirable immigrants at the various ports of entry, but
also for watching and keeping track of those ad
mitted, so that if they bcconie criminals or paupers
within five years after their arrival they may be re
turned to the country whence they came.
BY the general Â¦immigration bill recently sub-
to the House an effort has been, made
'to bring together in one act all the scattered
legislation enacted on the subject from 1875 to 1894,
reduce the whole to a consistent system and provide
the country with a better' method of immigrant regu
lation than we have hitherto 'put into practice.

THE PLAY "1402"â Subscriber, City.
The play "1192" was written by Rice.
There is in fact no valid argument to be made for'
the reciprocity scheme. It means the slaughter of
the protective system. It is a step toward free trade.
It will cause division in the Republican ranks on the
very eve of battle and encourage the free traders to
renew the contest that has always proven so disas
trous to American industries.*
It is to be borne in mind that the minority Repub
licans of the House who are standing firmly for prin
ciple and party loyalty to public pledges have dis
closed no opposition to granting any relief to Cuba
that may be honestly needed by the islands. It has
been announced again and, again that protectionists
are willing to accept a bill for the relief of Cuba pro
vided it be drawn so as to give relief where it is
really needed, and dees not involve a reduction of
the tariff. If we owe anything to Cuba let it be be
stowed ;ri the form of a bounty and be distributed
among the needy. . It is an injustice to impose the
whole burden upon two American industries and be
stow the whole favor upon the speculators who have
got possession of Cubnn sugar plantations. .'.., ' V.
The danger is all the greater because there are a
number of so. called Republicans in the big cities of
the East who arc quite willing to betray the party on
this issue. That was made evident by . the recent
adoption by the Republican Club of New York of a
resolution declaring: "It is the opinion of this club
that a moral and political obligation rests on this
country to reduce the tariff on Cuban' sugar and to
bacco, and to do so promptly." The declaration, Is
hardly better than a hypocritical sham. This coun
try has neither a political nor a moral obligation to
t educe tariff rates or. imports from Cuba, and if
it had the obligation would not require a reduction
upon sugar and tobacco only. It would rest equally
on the whole American people and require a reduc
tion on the whole array of protective duties.
In adopting the Cuban scheme the majority of
Republicans in the House have in fact entcred'upon
a road that will lead to ruin. The most astute Demo
cratic leaders could hardly wish Republicans to make
a greater blunder than the one proposed. At the
present time the demoralized Democrats are looking
for an issue upon which to go before the people.
They have been for some time busily engaged in dis
cussing the advisability- of reviving the fight against
the tariff. The National Free Trade League is urg
ing them to undertake it, and David Bennett Hill
has already declared himself in favor of it. r This,
therefore, is a bad time for Republican leaders to pre
cipitate a split in the ranks, of the party on the ques
tion. It would be like dividing the strength of an
army at the strategic point of a field where battle is
about to take place.
WHILE the Republican members of Con
gress who have agreed in caucus to carry
out the Cuban reciprocity scheme consti
tute a majority of the party in the House, they do
not by any means represent the Republican majority
of the country. In fact so far as this particular
measure is concerned they do not represent Repub
licanism at all. Such reciprocity so, called as they
purpose toÂ»enact is a Democratic policyâ a. step in
the direction of free trade. " / < 'Â¦
The Republican party under its great leaders has
taught the American people that protection is a
comprehensive. principle for the promotion of all
American industries. If once a protective policy be
applied to certain industries but denied to others^'it
will cease to be a matter of principle and become a
mere affair of expediency. There will .immediately
follow a discussion as to what interests should be pro
tected and what shou!d be left to foreign competi
tion; and it is easy; to foresee what would be the re
sult of such a. debate before the people. The sense
of fairness among the voters would lead to"a rejection
of any 'such partial and unjust system. The voters
who have sustained the Republican principle. of com
prehensive protection could not be relied upon to
sustain a protective policy that was dependent upon
log rolling at Washington and not upon justice.

Summing up;. the whole subject the writer con
cludes by saying: "If there be no place for the
Chinaman in America there is ample room for the
American in China. Britishers : at least will rejoiqe
in "the energy and enterprise of , Brother Jonathan,
for their interests; are. alike." Â¦ It is not agreeable to
have to, meet so kindly;. a .notice of ourselves with'
anything in the way' of criticism, but if the British in \\
China feel; that their interests are alike with those of
the United States, they would do well to adopt the
American policy of dealing with them. Since moral
suasion has been so effective .on our part, John Bull
would better follow the example; V * '
The remission of a large part of the indemnity, de
manded of " China for the injury done. to Americans
during the Boxei; outbreak is another thing which
has counted in our favor.,,
, Finally the Herald says: ''There. is the significant
fact that Americans" practically control the colleges
and so eventually the mind of the" Middle Kingdom."
The Imperial and' Peking universities in the capital,
the Tientsin University,, the ;St. John's College,: the.
Anglo-Chinese College, the Nanyang Collegeâ all
are under "Americans. Although the scholarship used
to be on the side of Britons like Morrison and 'Med
hurst, Legge and Giles, it seems to be passing into
the hands of Americans like, Allen and Martin, Shef
field and Smith. Mind is the greatest of all power; :
the pen is mightier than the sword. There is nouse :
disguising th'e ifact that, American intellect, is giving
an immense^ prestige to Ameflcan policy." ; Â¦Â¦ ..

Examination for Promotions.
Hutchinson was called, and after detail
ing his meeting with a blonde woman at.
the corner of Taylor and Post streets and
the Incidents leading up to the robbery
said that the woman, after taking M0 out
of his p&kets, suggested that the shorter
cf the two men should knock him on the
head .with the butt end of a revolver. In
cross-examination he said he had been in
the army and had asked for a pension on
the ground that his brain had been af
fected from attacks of catalepsy. He ad
mitted that his brain and eyesight hai
been affected by these attacks, but hÂ«
had thoroughly recovered six months ago.
He continually contradicted himself,
showing that his memory was still defec
tive. He was positive that the defendant
was the woman decoy. The case will bs
resumed to-day. - â¢ '-.

THE SAN FRANCISGO CALL, TUESpAY^ MARCH 23, 1902.
Four Frenchmen Sail.
Four French barks, the Marie Molinos,
Marthe Rouxe, Ville de Dijon and General
Keumayer, sailed together yesterday for
Queenstcwn. The captain of the Marthe Rouse
claims to have the fastest ship. The other
skippers have an equally cood opinion of their
own commands and an tnterestrtes race is
looked for.
Captain Commits Suicide.
A dispatch received yesterday by the Mer
chants' Exchange from Guaym. . reportr, the
suicide in that harbor of Captain Hooklemr.nt.
of the German bark Anticone. The captain
was in low spirits, Induced by continued III
health, and ended his troubles by Jumping
overboard from the deck of hts ship.
Reinsurance List.
Reinsurance on the French bark MacMahon
Policeman Henneberry had a hard tussle yes
terday morning: with a French sailor who had
been ordered to Frarfce for trial for desertion
and whose passage was booked on the French
bark General Neumayer. The prisoner deserted
a. French ship about a year ago. He was ar
rÂ»Â«ed three weeks ago on a consular warrant.
Jit- did not seem to realize where he was
goins until he and Henneberry. who had him
in custody, reached Crowley's boathouse. He
fought the policeman from the boathouse to
the float and continued to light in spurts until
he was r>laced in irons in the forepeak of the
Neumayer, .'

Inferno, with a badly commie-;
Bioned commissariat ; department. The
bark arrived here on -Sunday and an
chored off Vailejo street. The police sig
nal was hoisted yesterday morning, and
two of- Captain Dunleavy's men 'arrived
on board in. time to prevent Joseph Verne,
a sailor, from carving marks of his dis
pleasure upon the persons oÂ£ the bark's
afterguard. Verne was taken ashore and
locked in a cell at the City Prison pend^
ing his examination on a charge of mu
tiny. :
Verne Is said to have refused duty thir
ty days out of Newcastle. He backed up
his refusal by trying to lick the mate. HÂ«
was ironed, confined to a small room arid
dieted on bread and water until yester*
day, when he was relEa.-ed. He celebrated
his liberty by attempting- to stick, his
jack-knife into those responsible for his
confinement. - â¢ ' . â¢â¢
Belaying pins and some active dodging
prevented the sailor from hurting any
thing but the ship's discipline until the
police arrived. Just as the representa
tives of the law climbed over the side a
well-aimed belaying pin struck Verne on
the head and made him a good, sailor lonsr
enough to enable the police to handcuff
him.
Five other sailors left the" ship. Among
them were two Americans, who declare
that although their ignorance of French
kept them out of the daily quarrels, they
never thought that Verne with his bread
and water diet had any the worse of the
food argument.
The officers say that everything was
peace on the Reine Blanche; that oniy
one man, Verne, had given any trouble;
that he was a natural-born mutineer and
would now be punished for his sins. As
for the foodâ well, what if there were a
few grubs in the hardtack. Grubs are
slothful creatures, easily detected and
captured without difficulty. And in hash,
who knows grubs from biscuit?
"Sailors are hard to please," said Cap
tain Loreau, "and you people on shore
must hot believe all they tell you."
The troubles of the Reine Blanche will
be ventilated before the French Consul.
ACCORDING to the sailors that
worked her from Newcastle, NV
S. W.. to this port, the .French
bark Reine Blanche is a iloating

SOFTNESS OF SEALSKIN
Is Rivaled by Human Hair Whore
Dandruff la Eradicated. . ;
Sealskin Is admired the world over.. for
Its softness and glossiness; and yet the
human hair is equally as soft and glossy
when healthy; and tho radical cause of all
hair trouble is dandruff, which is caused
by a pestiferous parasite that saps the
vitality of the hair at its root. Newbro's
Herplcide is the only preparation that is
fatal toj!he dandruff germ. Without dan-
druff no falling hair, but a luxuriant
growth of glossy, soft hair is certain.
Scouring the scalp won't cure dandruff.
Kill the dandruff germ. Thousands of
women owe their .beautiful suits of hair
to Newbro's Herpiclde.

According to the Pacific Coast advices of
the New. York Journal of Commerce," ."the
total exports of Prunes from California dur
ing January were 4,800,000 pounds â 160 car
loads. The report for February has not yet
been received, but will undoubtedly aggregate
a satisfactory quantity, inasmuch - as ship
ments were, continually going forward during
that month as well as during the early portion
of March. \ The quantity remaining on the
Coast from the 1900 crop February 1 was
V. 000, 000 pounds, and possibly 4,500,000 pounds
cf small prunes, 120s and up, belonging to the
Kmall prune syndicates. There, are now only
about 15,000,000 pounds of prunes on the Coast,
of which nearly one-third are small prunes of
the 1000 crop, to meet- the requirements of
exporters and the | natural consumptive de

CHICAGO. March 24. â There was continued
heavy liquidation in wheat at the opening 011
the .strength of the weather "conditions. It
seemed that every portion of the winter wheat
country had received its share of rainfall and
everything favored crop growth. Statistics
were bearlshly inclined and traders were in a
guessing mood. The seaboard reported addi
tional exports Saturday and ten loads early to
day. Speculators were inclined to the belief
that there should.be a natural reaction after
Saturday's extreme weakness ' and shorts
sought cover in large numbers. Cables were
weaker, but not enouch so to 1 make bulls . ap
prehensive. The general situation had changed
little, but big local traders and commission
houses were Inclined to the buying- side on the
argument that wheat was on a new basis and
would see marked activity. Trade in general
was heavy and the tone for some time nerv
ous. In the end the buying side -showed th?
most strencth. May opened" %@%c lower at
71%c to 71%c, dipped to 71%c on the heavy
eellins, reacted to 72%c, fluctuated nervously,
sold up to 72%c and closed firm, %@%c high
er, at 72%@72%c. Â¦ â¢
Corn had the largest trade in many days.
Speculation was mixed and nervous and the
pit at all times was crowded. The opening
was weak and lower, but the crowd . covered
and berran to take the bull side. , . For sijme
time it was hard to tell which way the mar
ket was going. Near the close outside buying
orders came in and Mav closed with .a firm
tone. Vs@%c higher, at 58%@58%c. â¢â¢
Trade in oats was not important and follow
ed other grains. May closed %c up at 42%c.
. Provisions were off a little at the opening,
but there soon sprang up a good commission
house demand, supposed to be for packers' ac
count, and the cash business was much Im
proved. Â¦ May pork closed strong, 35c higher*
lard, 20@22%c up and ribs 20@22%c higher.

Wheat and Other Grains.
, WHEATâ Chicago was. a fraction or so high
er, with 'more buyers . than sellers and cash
houses buying. The 'weather In -the West and
Southwest was showery and the shprt3 were
inclined to take their profits. The general
opinion was that the decline had been over
done, and ' the market became firm, but it had '
little or no outside support and the St. Louis
bears broke out again as big sellers of both
wheat and corn. The export business was quiet
er. It was very large during the closing days of
last week." and most of the long wheat ac
cumulated during the dry. weather scare was
liquidated "and' went into new hands. New

pressed on account of a fear that the Ana
conda, dividend to be acted upon this week will
not be maintained. , There was an active spec
ulation In the United States Leather stocks at
advances of a point or more, accompanied . by
reports, subsequently circulated, that the Ac
cumulated dividends due on the preferred stock
were to be funded into a bond. \ Louisville and
Nashville and Chicago, Indianapolis and Louis
ville ro^e together in the later trading, thus
reviving- the old rumors of a combination. Out
side of these cases the market' was uneven and
very Irregular. Colorado . Fuel and Iron was
active and erratic, ranging both above and be
low Saturday's price and closing with a net
gain of a point. Soothing assurances were
heard that the condition of the money market
wai perfectly safe, but it is yet felt that there
is daneer of flurries in the money market in
case sterling exchange again hardens toward
the gold export point. The â¢ market closed
heavy.
The bond market was irregular. Total sales,
par value, $1,720,000.

Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New York eay: "The
situation in currants presents Bome uneasiness,
notwithstanding the views of sellers hold
around 5c for fine Amallas uncleaned in barrels.
Reports are current that this figure on firm
offer inisht be shaded in some quarters, but
we are unable to confirm sales at lower than
the Inside quotations on fine Amallas. The de
mand Is light, although some inquiry from in
terior points is heard of for round lots, with
prospective buyers' ideas somewhat under the
market. The large number of holders, coupled j
with the slack buying interest, has Induced a
feeling of unrest. Stocks in bond on March 1 j
are given as 6.B98.6S.1 pounds, compared with I
3,090,362 pounds on the same date last year. |
The market In Greece is quoted above the par
ity of spot cost to .lay down. I
"In prunes a fair Jobbing interest is shown
with firmness noted on large sizes, j For 40-50
Santa Clara fruit new in 25 lb boxes offerings
are available In some quarters at 6%c. but some
holders ask up to 7c. Outside fruit is avail
able at around 6%c in new prunes. Sixes 50-60
show a fair interest, and a little more move
ment is noted in Cfi-7<Â». Smaller sizes are not
in active demand and the feeling continues
barely steady. Coast advices report no Impor
tant change in the general situation there. 1
Oregon prunes on the spot are steady and In ]
fair request.
"In raisins spot seeded continue dull and show
no special feature, with choice and fancy in
1 lb cartons available at 8Uc and 8%c re-
Fpectively. Valencia layers are showing a fair
movement, and 7%c is reported Inside. Apri
cots and peaches remain steady to firm with a
pood jobbing interest shown. Dates are un
changed and fairly active. Figs are in strong
position with spot etocks reduced. Bonded
stocks on March 1 are given as 517.786 lbs as
against 414,4-15 lbs on the same date last year.
The figures for this season are questioned in
the trade, the belief existing that stocks are I
considerably less than those given. j
"In nuts a fair business is doing l/i nuts in
shell, with Tarragona almonds offering more

NEW YORK. March 24.â To-day's market
made some attempt to rally from the reaction
ary, tendency that developed before the close en
Saturday and to resume the upward tendency
which -was becoming felrly general on Friday.
Prices started higher this morning.' but the
market . during j the day did not hold out the
promise of the- early dealings ana again re
lapsed into a dull- and drifting condition, with
the dealings almost entirely In professional
hands and only the more obscure stocks mov

marked demand for the Readings and an ap

crops. But the obvious ' fact that selling to
take profits was going on in St. Paul, showing
the work of professional hands, detracted from
the Influence of the new strength in the Read-

the most prominent capitalist in the street and
the return to New York from holiday excursions
of otjjer Jarse capitalists wens looked to by the
rar-r; sanguine of the traders to result In a re
'^^ition of market activity, but except for the

CHICAGO. March 24.â Kid Carter of
Brooklyn knocked out Joe Choynskt in
the first round of a six-round contest to
night at the America Club. It was either
man's' battle up to the final blow. Choyn
ski had reached Carter's jaw with both
hands at least twenty times and had the
Brooklyn man staggering, when the lat
ter made a desperate lunge with his right
for Choynski. The blow landed in the pit
of Choynskl's stomach and double him up.
Before he could .straighten himself out
Carter chopped him with a right on the
jaw. Choynski went down, but came to
his feet staggering, barely able to hold
his hands up. Instead of endeavoring;
to clinch, Choynski stood off and began
slugging. Carter, who had recovered from
the terrible beating he had received, was:
the stronger and after. â¢ missing several
desperate swings he finally landed a full
right swing on Joe's jaw. The blow had
such force that It lifted Choynski clear
off his feet and he went down on the top
of his head. It was thought for a time
that he had been seriously Injured, but
with the assistance of a physician his
handlers brought him. to his senses after
he had been unconscious for fully ten
minutes. The round lasted two minutes
and thirty-five seconds.

Damages.
James E. Damon yesterday filed suit
against The Blue Lakes Water Company,
J. B. Emery president .and Robert McF.
Doble, secretary, and W. Frank Pierce, to
recover 1000 shares of the capital stock
of the defendant corporation, or J6000 in
lieu thereof, together with $1000. Con
spiracy, oppression, fraud and malice a-e
allfged.
The Blue Lakes Water Company was
incorporated February 28, 18S7, and on
April 17, 1830, the company was reincor
porated under the name Blue Lakes
Water Company. While the company was
essentially the same, the dropping of the
word "the" on the reincorporation made
It a new concern in the sight of the law.
All the water rights of the first named
ccrr.pany, valued at $500,000 and upwards,
were transferred to the successors, one of
the agreements being that all share
holders of the old company should receive
four shares of the capital stock of the
succeeding cotupanv.
The plaintiff c-alins that this reincor
poration savored of fraud and that
Emery and Doble transferred 30,000 shares
of the Ftock of the new incorporation to
Pierce on his threat that he would ruin
them financially. When the plaintiff dis

After a long chase by Mexican troops
some years ago, Soto was captured with
several of his followers. They . were to
have been executed, but Soto broke jail
on the second night and escaped to the
United States.' He assumed the name of
Estivano Lopez and. since then has passed
as a wood chopper, filling in his Â»JÂ»e mo
ments by engaging in petty mievery.
Last December he was sentenced in Los
Angeles for petty larceny, but broke away
from the chain gang. He was not again
heard of until captured a few days ago,
in company witn a fellow Mexican, as he
was trying to sell a horse blanket ho had
stolen. On this charge -he was bound
over, to the Superior Court.
The outlaw . probably will be sent to
Mexico, where certain death awaits mm.

the intention of the company to ask for
anything from this end of the line except
the right of way for the present and tne
patronage of the people hereafter. We
have already^ financed the corporation and
the capital is ready' whenever we call for
it, there having been no difficulty in in
teresting bankers and brokers in New
York in the project.
"The plan does not contemplate a mere
street car line, but, on the contrary, it is
expected a big freight business will be
developed between this point and the

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 24.-The
tenth annual Arkansas Derby waa run
over a slow track. It rained for twenty
four hours prior to the race. The win
ner turned up in Prowl, a seasoned horse
from New Orleans. He was an outsider
in the betting. George Bennett's colt
Herodlade, who went to the post a strong
favorite at 4 t& 5, led for a half-mile and
then went all to pieces. He stopped going
in the stretch and finished absolutely
last. The field got off well bunched, but
there was a lot of crowding on the first
turn. Colburn on Herodiaae cut across
the track and forced Huntressa to pull
up. Had It not been for the Jostling thÂ«Â»
result might have been different. Prowl
was well ridden. He was nicely placed
during the early part of the race and
came with a rush at the end that waa
npt to be denied. Prowl made bis run
from the eight pole. Results:

TOPEKA, " Kans.,- March 24.â Miss

horsewhipped Mayor Parker In his office
at the city building this morning. Three
times she struck the Mayor and then ho
sprang at her, tore the- rawhide out Of
her hand and puBhed her into the hall.
As Miss -Boise was thrust out; of the
office- by Mayor Parker she exclaimed:
"Thank God, I've done it. I've horse
whipped you. and now I'm going to horse
whip the Governor." â¢ .
Before beginning her horsewhipping-
Miss Boise . gave the Mayor a severe
scolding and accused him; of being re

running openly . in Topeka and lor
murder which was recently committed in
a local saioon. She had the whip con

' Miss Boise is a nurse by profession and
is about 35 years of. age. Â¦ .
When seen by the reporters after the
affair -Mayor Parker refused, to discuss
it. The woman who whipped him talked
freely, however. She sald:
â¢I was in sympathy with Mrs. Nation,
but did not take part in her raids. I
have come to the conclusion that the only
way to make public officers . enforce the

RAILS FROM KERN
COUNTY TO COAST
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 24.
The refusal of Justice of the Peace Stet
son to issue a subpena for G. B. Daniels,
general manager of the Oakland Enquirer,
to appear before him to have his deposi
tion taken on Wednesday next In the now
noted Enquirer litigation, has caused "D.
Edward Collins, 'the plaintiff in the case,
to appeal to the Superior Court to force
'Justice Stetson to issue the subpena.
When the Justice refused to act in the
matter Mr. Collins filed an affidavit > In
the Superior Court declaringÂ»that he de
sired to have the deposition taken and
that Justice Stetson refused to issue the
subpena. Upon this affidavit Mr. Collins
asked that the Superior Court issue a writ
of mandate compelling the Justice to Issue
the subpena and conduct the hearing.
The matter was referred to Judge Greene
of the Superior Court and this afternoon
the Judge issued an alternative writ of
mandate to Justice Stetson requiring him
to appear to-morrow morning at 11 o clock
and show cause why he did not issue the
subpena.
G. B. Daniels refused tD answer any
questions before Court Commissioner
Babcock and when it was decided that
the Court Commissioner had no power to
punish for contempt no way was found
to make him answer. Now appeal has
been made to a Justice of the Peace, but
the Justice does not desire to act in the
matter and Mr. Collins .seeks to have the
Superior Court force him to do so.
"All that we want is to have Mr. Dan
iels answer a few very Important ques
tions." said Mr. Collins to-day.
"The indications are that they are try-
Ing to get me into Jail." said G. B. Dan
iels commenting upon this new move.
There was an entire absence of com
ment regarding the purpose of Russia
and France to move together in the Far
East. Like the United States, Germany
is apparently keeping aloof from all alli
ances regarding China. Her relations
with Great Britain are so strained . and
her pretensions to Shantung are so an
tagonistic to Japanese interests that it Is
not likely that she will join the alliance
of the Tokio and London governments,
even if an opportunity were offered her.
In diplomatic circles here the belief Is
expressed that should the occasion neces
sitate she will range herself in all Chinese
questions alongside of Russia. and France.
A high . official of the Government with
whom I talked to-day spoke of the highly
influential position the United States now
has in China. This Government is abso
lutely free from any entangling alliances
and In the discussion of Chinese Questions
will be able to act with an absolutely free
hand. Its Interests are commercial and
not territorial and' as a result of the earn
est work of Secretary Hay every power
has Iterated and reiterated pledees of its
support to maintain China's. territorial In
tegrity and to acquire no exclusive priv
ileges therein. . : . " Â¦ -
This agreement announced the purpose
of Germany and Great Britain to observe
the principles â¢ of the territorial Integrity
Of China and the open door, which. In his
report, Hay stated. was gratifying to the
United States. A clause of this agreement
provided for the operation of the two gov
ernments together In case It became nec
essary to take, steps for the protection of
their own interests. "As this clause refers
to reciprocal arrangements between two
high contracting powers," Hay stated,
"the Government of the United States
does not regard Itself as called upon to ex
press an opinion in respect to it." â¢â¢-Â¦.= â¢Â»â¢
The same observation is made with re
spect,to the Anglo-Japanese alliance.
The reply of the United States to the
recent- Franco-Russian declaration was
delivered yesterday and the correspond
ence will probably be published this week.
The Secretary expressed gratification that
both Russia and France had announced
as their policy the principles which have
been continually advocated by the United
States.
. Great Britain had especial reason to be
aware of the policy of this country . in
view of Hay's reply to the note of iord
Pauncefote, communicating, to him the
agreement made betweenthe London and
Berlin governments during , the Boxers'
revolt. : ; â¢Â¦â¢... :
. As more Is to be gained; by maintaining
absolute silence regarding Its ' policy . and
by : dealing with the questions as they
arise, this Government has declined to
give any intimation of its future action
should the relations of Great Britain and
Japan. on the one hand and Russia and
France on the other became strained to
the point of breaking.. .The President will
use his good offices to preserve peace. The
United titatea does not want war. The
policy of this Government Is one of peace,
and every effort will be made to preserve
existing conditions. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . -
The United States was not Invited to
Join the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Both
Great Britain and Japan understand
that the historic. policy ot the United
States forbade its participation in Â¦ "en
tangling alliances." . '. ,
CALL. BUREAU, -1406 G STREET,' N.
W.. WASHINGTON, March .24.â Because
of : the importance . of : the attitude; ol .the
United States, 'representatives of the great
powers in Washington . have ,'m'ade ; an
earnest effort to ascertain Its character In
case of war in the. far East. . ' : \ ;
'They dragged me over the hills at the
end of the rope," he said. "The rope was
around my ankle and it hurt.
"This charge of insanity is utterly ab
surd,'' he continued. "But I have money
and I will fight to a finish. The idea of
tending me to an asylum! I'm neither
dangerous to myself nor any one else and
you cant send a man to an asylum un
less he is dangerous."
Thompson had not been on the stand
long before he had to make way for an
other case and the hearing came ud aeain
et5 Â£clpck. At that time Drs. Hamiin
and lledros testified that they thought
the man ought to be restrained. Judge
Melvin did not decide what he would do
though intimating that he would commit
him to an asylum, and continued the
hearing until to-morrow morning. . -
There Is a question as to what kind of
an asylum he ought to be committed
Thompson wants to go to Napa if he is
committed, and he has urged his attor
ney to make a special plea for him. His
brother wants him sent to a private asy
lum, where he proposes to pay the ex
penses.
This lassoing episode was very humil
iating to Thompson's pride and he com
plained bitterly about it on the witness
stand.
Lassoing Humiliated Him.
Thompson has been roaming at will
about the country for three or four
years. He came to California five months
e.-o and spent some of his tjme at Los
Oatos. Two weeks ago he went to the
Livermore Sanitarium because* he was
iiot well. There his brother, who had
been following him around the country
found him and tried to persuade him to
etay until he fully recovered. He thought
he would be restrained and ran away
over the hills, but was recaptured by a
vaquero, who lassoed him and dragged
him back to the sanitarium.
Kicks Plate Glass to Pieces.
On account of his perverseness In the
Unusual, Thompson's people have had
him put under restraint four or five
times. Once they put him in a private
eeylum in Michigan and he kicked $lwX>
worth of plate glass into pieces and the
tamily had to foot the bill. He escaped
ana went to New Orleans and put up at
the best hotels without having a cent to
pay for the luxury. When the hotel pro
prietor ejected him such a sympathy was
created In his behalf by the newspapers
and the hotel guests that a big purse was
raised in a few hours to tide him over his
embarrassment. . -
A eocd part of Thompson's mother's
fortune has been spÂ«nt trying to avoid
scandal on his account. He developed a
penchant for getting himself Into trouble
and creating trouble for as many people
as he could at one time. His eccentriciil.is
have led him to consort with anarchists
and to perform all sorts of unheard-of
things that bring men Into public notice
and heap notoriety on their relatives.
"Watts C. Thompson, the wealthy young
roan from Michigan, who was arrested
last Saturday for Insanity at the instance
of his brother, Philip Thompson, was
given a chance in Judge Melvin's court
this morning to clear himself of the im
peachment against him. Thompson Is an
interesting insane suspect not only on ac
count of his wealth, which is said to
nearly touch the million-dollar mark, but
because he is a first cousin to young
Lelter, the man who made most wheat
plungers look like pigmies when he de
scended Into the bidding pits of Chicago
several years ago. His mother and Lel
ter's mother are sisters, and both have
large sums of money in their names.

Captain Hancock took great interest in
every question looking to the development
of this section. He was an earnest ex
ponent of water storage and was the local
representative of the Agua Fria Canal
and Reservoir Company, a partially com
pleted enterprise.
After the close of the war he was em
ployed as a post trader for some years
and In 1871 came to the Salt River Valley.
Being an engineer, he was . employed by
his associates to survey the townslte of
Phoenix. Captain Hancock then erected
the first house ever built on the townsite.
This dwelling was torn down some years
ago to make room for a business block.
He was the first postmaster and later
the first Sheriff of the county and held
numerous official positions since then. He
surveyed the Salt River Valley canal, the
oldest irrigation ditch in the Territory
now In use and one of the best.
Captain Hancock was a pioneer of Cali
fornia and Arizona. He went to Cali
fornia across the plains from Iowa in the
early fifties and for some years engaged
In mining and ranching in Sacramento
County. In 1S64 he enlisted in Cpmpany
K, Seventh Regiment. California Volun
teers, and, marching south, reached Yuma
in 186G. From there he was sent to Fort
McDowell and later was made captain of
a company of Plma Indians, whose serv
ices were employed against the hostile
Apaches. His exploits in Indian warfare
form a large part of Arizona's early his
tory.

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.
TO close out a lew odd styles of pianos we
have marked the prices dotrn very low. and
you c*.n, while they last, secure a very great
discount on some cpeclally good instruments.
Some of them have been sent as 6ainple
pianos. The instruments are all right And
as euch fully warranted, but as the expense
of reshipment would be quite a sum. the
factory is Â¦willing to make this sacrifice. We
have also the Decicer-Wiesner and Bau-
mÂ»iet.ers in all styles. Payments if you want.

WHERE "La Madeleine" last
week flaunted her painted
woes, this week "The Chris
tian" holds sway, at the Co
lumbia Theater, with Edward
Morgan and Elsie Leslie a-t the head of
things. A great many had evidently not
seen "The Christian." or, seeing it before,
were persuaded of the pleasure of again
seeing It, for the house was a decidedly
good one. It was felt by many play-goers
that the beforetime presentation of the
play, some two years ago. at the Colum
bia Theater, was rather a second-rate af
fair. Productions and people were of the
substitute class that the Eastern manager,
more frequently in the dear dead days
than now, used to hand out to us. * This
can by no means be said of the present
production offered by the Llebler people,
which is excellently cast and handled
throughout with conspicuous efficiency.
"The Christian" probably comes as near
conviction in the hands of its present ex
ponents aa it Is possible for a play of
lUs Inherent artificiality to come, and tho
acting Is well worth seeing, quite outside
of any merits the drama may possess.
The smallest role is amply cared tor, and
the principals compel strong sympathy
and interest throughout the whole course
of the play. It was evidently very jivell
enjoyed last night, Mr. Morgan and Miss
Leslie sharing several enthusiastic re
calls. . .
After Little Lord Fauntleroy, Miss Kl
sie Leslie in long frocks and grewn-up
emotions came oddly, but more than
gratefully. It is a far cry from the
quaint lovableness of the be-sashed and
be-curled little boy to the broad woman
liness of Glory Quayle, the high-spirited
Manx lassie who found fortune and fame
for herself In far London town, but Miss
Leslie has made the stride and must be
conceded a high place among contempo
rary stage lights. The freshness and
sparkle of her earlier work are retained,"
their delightful naturalness and ease. But
che has grown in power and gained in
technique, and has added to her large
personal charm a new note of true
womanliness. As the young Manx girl,
in- her willful, restless beauty, longing
to see the great world and to try her
wings. Miss Leslie is absolutely convinc
ing. Her impersonation has all the bril
liancy of winsome youth, the young ardor
and happy hopefulness of romantic in
experience. Later, as an actress, amid
the temptations of stage life, the clear
current of her day becomes muddled, her
ideals disturbed, and Miss Leslie again
admirably Indicates the emotional spirit

In their, farce "The New Coachman"
seemed to bo the favorites of the audi
ence. Frank Lincoln, the humorist, who
toured the world with the Eastern base

of amusement. Fanny Rice also proved a
successful funmaker. Hedrix and Pres

play is a good melodrama, splendidly
staged and the characters are all cleverly
portrayed. Georgle Cooper, always clever,
excelled herself last night as a French
girl in love with Ensign Barry Hanley

enacted by Edwin T. Emery. Annette
Marshall's Elinor Danlelgh.^ a' difficult

sleuth happened to see a photgraph of a
pianist and actor who for the last four
years has been employed at a cineo
graph theater on Market street.
When shown a portrait of Nora Fuller,
published a few days after the discovery
of the dead girl's body in the vacant
house on Sutter street, Ida Jeffries said
that it was not the portrait , of the girl
she met nearly. two years ago. The
statements made by Ida Jeffries were so
contradictory that no reliance is placed
on .her story, that she ever met 'a girl
who gave her name as Nora Fuller.

a flurry Sunday by claiming that he had

Ida Jeffries not only told a lurid story
of her friendship with Nora Fuller, but
also claimed that she had seen her with
a strange man shortly before her disap
pearance, the man answering the descrip
tion of Bennett. When closely questioned
Ida Jeffries . admitted that twenty-one
months ago she had casually met a girl
on the street who gave her name as Nora
Fuller, and that she had met this girl
about six times in the following two
weeks and had not seen her since.

Jeffries that she was well acquainted

through an error of the secretary of the
Police Commission, who should have sent
it to the Clerk of the Board. Boxton said
that through an oversight the papers had
lain in the Police Committee's box, of
which he is chairman. He denied that
there was any intention to conceal the
documents.
At the opening of yesterday's session of
the Board of Supervisors Box ton pre
sented the drafts of two proposed ordi
nances to prohibit the playing of poker in
saloons. They were framed by the Police
Commission. He also presented a com
munication dated January 30, 1902, from
the same body, urging the passage of the
measure. The communication says:
SAN FRANCISCO, January 30, 1902.
To the Hon. Charles Boston, chairman Police
Committee of the Board of Supervisors â Sir:
Pursuant to instructions received by ma at a
meeting I of the Police Commissioners held
January 28, 1902. I respectfully refer to the
Police Committee of the Board of Supervisors
for its consideration the inclosed drafts of two
proposed ordinances and the Inclosed draft of
an order amendatory of section 78 of order
No. 1037. These ordinance? are designed to
suppress the playing- of poker in saloons and
public places, an evil which existing laws do
not seem to reach. The Police Commission
requests you and your colleagues to give this
subject the careful consideration which its Im
portance warrants, with a view, to recom
mending to the board the passage of the ordi
nances herewith submitted to you and of all
such legislation as may be necessary to ef
fectually prevent and inhibit such poker play
ing. Respectfully,
BOARD OF POLICE COMMISSIONERS.
B. J. CADWALADER, Secretary.

Fischer's Theater, the home of bur

successful show houses of the city. The
best people are enjoying the performances
Powel Fredrick, the appointee of Mayor
Schmitz as clerk of the Justices' Court,
said last night that he will continue to
hold the office, and If McComb should at
tempt to transact the business of the
clerk's office action will be brought
against him and the case 'Will be carried
to the Suprema Court, when the question
as to his title to the office will be decided
as speedily as possible.
"Our contention is," said Fredrick,
"that under the charter the Mayor has
sole power in the premises, and the Su
preme Court alone will have to decide
who has title to the office." .
McComb was then called on for an ex
planation and said that while he had left
the office before the end of the day on
several occasions he always entered his
work the next morning-.
The vote to confirm McComb's nomina
tion follows: ' V
Ayesâ Alpers, Bent, Booth, Brandenstein,
Braunhart, Comte, Curtis, r/Ancona, Eggers,
Payct. Sanderson. Wilson â 12.
Noes â Connor, Ix>ughÂ«ry, Lynch, ilcClellan,
Wynn â 5.
"That is not so," said the Mayor. "I
will favor any man whom I consider a'
good man, whether he be a Republican
or a Democrat. I will say that McComb
was not removed because he played the
races, but he was derelict in not attend
ing to his duties during the afternoon
hours." -
Brandenstein asked the Mayor if he did
not object to McComb's confirmation on
account of the latter's political affilia
tions.
"It is all politics," said Connor. "It is
a ' fight between one Republican boss on
one side and a Republican boss on the
other. Â¦ There are eight Democrats on this
board besides four Democrats elected on
the Union Labor party ticket. I will vote
to confirm a good Democrat if the Jus
tices name one."
Connor "Wants Good Democrat.
Â¦ Wynn made a plea to abide by the
Mayor's desire, and Curtis argued that
the Board of Supervisors should not
hamper business in the Justices' court
by refusing to indorse the appointment
made by the Justices of the Peace.
"The Justices . are all Republicans,"
said Curtis, "and they have named a
good man. I think It Is our duty to con
iirm him." Â¦ Â¦'...
"When* the letter of the Justices of the
Peace nominating McComb had been read
Wynn said that the Mayor had stated at
the conterence held Thursday tnat he
would not lavor the confirmation of Mc-
Comb, because the latter had been re
moved wun Williams. The Justices of
the Peace, nowever, held that the Mayor
had no right to interlere in the appoint
ment of a Justices', clerk, said Wynn.
"1 have supported the Mayor in putting
a derelict omcial out . of office," said
Comte, "but 1 think my support should
stop there. 1 know Mr. McComb as a
capable clerk. 1 must consider that there
is now no Justices' clerk and public busi
ness is surtering. I don't believe that
politics should enter into the matter, and
J. intend to vote for McComb, even
though. I may be expelled from a Demo
cratic club. I therefore move that Mr.
McComb's nomination be confirmed."
"While we have sanctioned the Mayor's
course in removing Williams," said Bran
denstein, "I thin* that tne situation
should be relieved so that litigants may
be able to conduct their suits. I there
fore second the motion to confirm Mc-
Comb's nomination. While it is regret
table that McComu was associated with
Williams, I know that- he is competent
to nil the position."
Comte then presented the resolution to
confirm, the Mayor insisting that a reso
lution was necessary.
The Board of Supervisors by a vote
of 12 to 5 yesterday confirmed the nomin
ation: of George S. McComb to be clerk
of the Justices' Court, the nomination
having been sent in last -week by f oar
Justices of the Peace. A resolution was
adopted to that eirect and ratine^ Mc-
Comb's appointment for a period of two
years, the resolution to become effective
immediately. This course will result in
Powel Fredrick, the Mayor's appointee,
making way this morning for McComb,
who is now the legally constituted Jus
tices' clerk. The fact that the confirma
tion was done by resolution makes it pos
sible that the Mayor will exert his pre
rogative* to disapprove the measure, but
it is not thought that he will ck) so, as
the resolution, could be passed over his
head, i
improves on each representation. -There
is a weird fascination in watching the
play ' of features", of that sanctimonious,
i .hypocritical scoundrel,, the Baron Scar
pia, and the representation loses none of
'its villainy in the capable hands of Mel
bourne MacDowell. This is one of his
Â¦ best roles and he leaves no room for criti
cism. . He is ably supported by Florence
Stone as La Tosca. The torture scene in
the third act was so realistic last night
that it held the audience spellbound until
the fall ofÂ»the curtain and then . there
were several curtain calls for the leading
characters. Mr. Mayall impersonated
the artist, Mario, in his usual earnest,
vigorous way anckwas liberally applauded
for his conscientious efforts. William
Bernard's fugitive Angelotti and Fred
Butler's Schiarone were equally earnest
and faithful works of art. The waits be
tween acts are too long. It is like a con
tinued story i.n a monthly magazineâ one
f org-ets the first chapter before the other
is begun.
