The War Ofllco to-day was feeding 300.

had confirmed the necessity for changes
in the army administration, in decentr.-il

clerks were being rapidly substituted in
the War Office for civilian officers and
clerks. , -Â¦ .â¢ :*'â¢Â£ .
In regard to recruiting, Brodrlck be

be expected, and probably the Indian

If tho volunteers were to bo a bnr to con

men to enlist for India at.d elsewhere
abroad It was proposed to give every one
a clear shilling per day. If, after two
years, the soldier decided to serve eight
years with the colors and four years in
the reserve, he would be paid an extra
6 pence daily. Brodrlck said this would
result in enlisting a better class of men.

SEATTLE, March 4.â The town of
Everett reports the discovery of a Bteer
with a golden tooth. This Interesting find
was made by an executioner in the em

A telegram . received here to-night from
Antwerp says the. diamond market is
calmer as a result of the proposals of
three diamond merchants to effect an ar
rangement with their creditors.
, LONDON, March 5.â The Amsterdam
correspondent of the Daily Mail says that
4000 men in the diamond trade there are
idle. It is declared, says the correspond
ent, that unless the diamond cleavers
abandon their strike soon every Antwerp
and Amsterdam factory will be closed.
' BRUSSELS, March 4.â Numerous and
contradictory reports are current here as
to the crisis in the diamond trade. The
newspapers refer to the impending fail
ures of several firms in the diamond busi
ness at Antwerp, Amsterdam and Lon
don. They allege that some diamond mer
chants have been guilty of extensive de
falcations and have fled to London and
New Yoj-k. The, crisis is said to be due
to the large quantity of goods on war
rant, which can only be disposed of at a
loss. . â¢ â¢

Preliminary plans for the installation of

being pushed forward. An inspection of
the battleship Illinois, now at the Brook

warlike natives, who gave his party
much trouble.
While no extended excavations were
possible with Dr. Hedin's little band of
travelers, he found enough to make him
certain that the Thibetans of a. thousand
years ago had reached a much higher
scale of civilization than the race in its
present generation. Stone and. wood
carvings and ancient manuscripts from
the temples, some of them bearing in
scriptions of highest Confucian priests,
shewed the superior knowledge and at

Collector of Internal Revenue John
Lynch was seen at his Berkeley resi
dence last night and when asked for a
statement as to Wray's resignation from
office said: , _ â¢â¢
Wray had been derelict in sending in his re
ports and on investigating I found that he had
been drinking. His duties had been somewhat
neglected and J when I saw him and told him
that his work was not what it should' be and
that it had been reported to me that he had
been drinking, he acknowledged that he was at
fault and -said he would resign. I told him
that I would accept his resignation, which I
did when it was handed to me. Wray resigned
some time near the first of last month and
Hocking took up his position on the 16th.
These are all the circumstances of the case.
Hocking, the new deputy clerk at Los
Angeles, has been employed as war rev
enue deputy and later as war revenue
agent. Prior to his appointment in Los
Angeles he was assistant bookkeeper
with Lynch. His home is in San Bernar
dino. Â¦, a '-..'â¢Â¦' . Â¦Â¦. -
At the internal revenue office in this
city no definite information was given
out as to Wray's resignation from office,
but positive news was received in San
Francisco last night to the effect that
Joshua Hocking was in charge of the
Los Angeles internal revenue office.
Special Agent Bert Thomas is now in.
Honolulu, and his chief deputy, Frank
Driscoll, left for Los Angele3 yesterday
afternoon. * ,
John Wray, for some time deputy col
lector of internal revenue, stationed at
Los Angeles, is no longer drawing sal
ary from the â¢ Government, Collector of
Internal Revenue John Lynch having ac
cepted Wray's resignation and appointed
Joshua Hocking to succeed him.
Considerable secrecy has marked the
stepping out of office of John Wray and
the appointment of his successor. It was
learned early in the year that things
were not as harmonious between Wray
end Lynch as they should be and all
kinds of rumors filled the air. Lynch
went down to Los Angeles to make an
investigation of Wray's affairs and Spe
cial AgenUBert Thomas probed into his
accounts and sought for information in
the southland. ;
The amount involved is $1,500,000, the
sale being made -on a basis of $16 per
share. It was stated by persons inter
ested that the American Sugar Refining
Company was Interested in* the purchase.
It was also stated that the Colorado Beet
Sugar Refining Company was . the real
purchaser and that the deal was one of
several contemplated looking toward the
consolidation of the beet-sugar interests
of the country as opposed to the cane
sugar interests.
SALT LAKE, March 4.â The Evening
Telegram to-day .say's that negotiations
for the sale of an undivided half interest
in the U.tah Sugar Company have practi
cally been concluded and that -the deal
will be closed upon the arrival of Manager
T. R. Cutler in New York to-day.
President Wilcox of the Portland Flour
ing Mills Company and the Puget Sound
Flouring Mills Company returned from a
Trip to California yesterday. He declined
to discuss the project further than to gay
that for the present negotiations were at
a standstill. He admitted that consldcr
sible headway had been made -toward ef
fecting a sa.le.of milling properties on the
Â«-oest to a company which was to be
formed, and intimated that the deal had
been blocked for the present by inability
to agree on the valuation of certain prop
erties which had to be considered in ef
fecting the combination.
These concerns practically control the
flour trade of the Orient, their operations
extending from Vladivostok and Port
Arthur as far south as Singapore. Each
of the big firms has for a number of years
had men in all parts of the Orient pushing
the products of their mills far into the
interior of China, Japan. Korea, Siam and
Siberia, and through their efforts the busi
ness hae grown into vast proportions.
The Portland mills have been enlarged
until they now have a capacity of 5500
barrels a day. Other mills owned or con
trolled by the Portland concern are lo
cated in Salem, Oregon City and Albany,
Oregon, end Tacoma, Prescott, Dayton,
Harrington and Spokane, Washington.
In Oregon City, Dayton and Spokane the
uempany operates two mills at each place
ttnd at the other points one mill. Outside
of the Portland mill, that at Tacoma,
â¢with a capacity of 1S00 barrels a day, is
the largest of the eystem, and the com
bined capacity of all the mills is nearly
'.500 barrels a day.
PORTLAND. Or., Mar. 4.â The largest
industrial consolidation ever undertaken
in the Pacific Northwest is being quietly
v.osked Into shape in this city and San
Francisco. The enterprise is an amalga
mation of the interests of the great ex
port flour milling firms of the Pacific
Coast. No hint has been given as to the
capitalization of the proposed combina
tion, but it probably will be somewhere in
the neighborhood of $10,000,000. As now
outlined, the combination will embrace
mills having an annual capacity of more
than 5,000,000 barrels of flour and consum
ing more th&n one-third of the exportable
turplus of wheat grown in Oregon, Wash
ington and California. -Â»
The corporations interested in the pro
posed combine are the Portland Flouring
Mills Company of- this city; the Puget
Sound Flouring Mills Company of Ta
coma, which is owned by members of the
Portland Flouring Mills Company: the
Centennial Mills of Seattle and Spokane,
and the Sperry Flour Mills of Stockton

A BIG FORTUNE
Chief Wittman briefly addressed the
gathering upon the purposes for which it
was called. He said it was desirable for
the chiefs of police, not only in Califor
nia, but on the Pacific Coast, to band to- 1
gether for the purpose of facilitating their
operations. It was intended to form a sort
of co-operative society, through which the
chiefs might concentrate their efforts to
stamp out lawlessness. Heretofere, ow
ing to the lack of just such an organiza
tion as was proposed, the police along the
coast have been unable to accomplish the
best {results. Wittman expressed the con
viction that the association would accom- I
standing his heart was in the work. He
sent his best wishes for the success of the
organization to be formed.
Chairman Wittman announced that he
had letters from Charles H. Holmes. H. B.

San Diego and John Conrad of Alameda
announcing the intention of the writers
to attend the convention to-day. A letter

BOSTON, March 4.â During his visit to
this city Prince Henry will be given a
Masonic emblem of much value. The
souvenir will be presented during the
banquet at the Hotel Somerset by Wor
shipful Master Hanser of Germanla
Longe.
The donor is Mrs. V. C. Goodwin, who
wishes, as a "typical American woman,"
to present the gift as an expression. of
American good will to Germany. The em
blem Is In the form of a square and com
paas. The gold and the diamonds with
which it is studded arc said to be valued
at $10,000. The gold for the emblem came
from a nugget found by Mrs. Goodwin's
husband while a "forty-niner." Goodwin
was for fifty-one years a Mason and for
ilfteen years the grand treasurer of Con
necticut.

The merits of the city of Milwaukee : are
known; its industrial products are recorded â
not so, however, at one point which I could not
help noticing in passing through the crowded
streets of the city â In brief, the charming,
handsome, sweet and pretty faces belonging to
the ever fair sex (applause, cries of "Well,
well, well," and "bravo"), which are abund
ant In this city. Allow me to drink to the
health and prosperity of the lovely city of
Milwaukee.
At the conclusion of Prince Henry's re
marks Mayor Rose presented to Prince
Henry an elegantly bound album contain
ing photographs of Milwaukee's public
buildings arid some of the residences of
the city.
Prince Henry left for the East at 10
o'clock on a special train. ,A. large crowd
greeted him as he took his farewell.
Gentlemen. I will occupy your attention for
but a very few moments, as I am a trifle
hoarse, bavins: lost something in this country,
.namely, my voice, . which I hope, i however, to
regain. It is a pleasure to me to thank you
for the hearty welcome you have offered to me
in this lovely, handsome and sympathetic city
of yours, the principal city of "Wisconsin, and
famous for its thrift and Industry. I have
heard it acknowledged by you, as well as by
others, 'that the development of Milwaukee Is
due largely to the German element among your
citizens, a statement which fills .my heart with
pride and gladness. Inasmuch as I look upon
this German element as one of the strongest
ties between Germany and the United States.
I doubt not that those of German descent in
the future as in the past will be a credit to that
country which they proudly call their home, i
The fire run followed the public recep
tion and it made a spectacle that was
both novel and exciting. Thirty-two pieces
of apparatus, marshaled by Fire Chief
Foley, were raced for a mile at high
speed. They ran two abreast and 200 feet
apart. Darkness had come and the en
gine lights made the picture all the more
inspiring. The Prince was then driven,
through illuminated streets to the Hotel
Pfeister, where the banquet was served.
The table at which the Prince sat was
covered with Alabama smilax. Three
toasts were proposed, those -to the Presi
dent of the United States and the Em
peror of Germany being drunk while the
orchestra played' the national airs of the
two countries. These were followed by
the toast "Prince Henry of Prussia." The
Prince responded as follows:
Firemen Make a Hit.
Just outside the station 1000 veterans pi
the German wars were drawn up. .They
had come here from all parts of the State
and they gave the Prince a volley of
cheers as he passed them. The business
streets were blocked with people and the
police had to fight to keep a driveway
clear. Prince Henry was given the honor
of riding in the first carriage to roll across
the new Grand avenue-Wisconsin . street
bridge, and as this point was reached
Battery A, stationed on the lake front,
fired a salute of twenty-one guns.
The reception of the Prince as he drove
through the streets was wildly enthusias
tic and there was an ovation when he en
tered the Exposition building for the pub
lic reception. As he appeared on the
stage, escorted by hia staff and the.re
ception committee, the Mannechor chorus
of 600 voices sang "Der Deutsch Lied."
There were 10,000 persons in the Exposi
tion building and it was long before they
were sufficiently stilled for Chairman
Johnson to briefly introduce Mayor Rose,
who informally welcomed the Prince to
the city. The Mayor gave way to former
Congressman P. V. Deuster, who spoke In
behalf of the German residents and In
their tongue. Governor' La Follette then
welcomed the Prince to Milwaukee in be
half of the State. The great chorus sang
again and as the Prince arose to leave the
hall the crowd broke ,into cheers. .-He
touched his cap in salute' and smiled as
he turned to leave the stage. ..,:: Â¦â¢ .
Cheers From Thousands.
The Prince'3 special train came at 4
o'clock and at 10 was away again on the
long run to Niagara and New England.
The intervening time was all given over
to the. reception and entertainment of the
royal visitor. It began with a drive
through the business and residential dis
tricts in review before a crowd that num
bered 200,000. Then there was a public
reception, at. which Governor Robert La
Follette and Mayor David Rose voiced
their welcome and the united singing so
cieties raised their voices .in mighty
chorus. There was also a splendid illum
ination and a thrilling night run of the
Milwaukee Fire Department. â¢ Later there
was a banquet, at which the Prince, met
the leading citizens of the city and State
The special train bearing the Prince ana

VANCOUVER, B. C., March 4.âStart
ling evidence of a marine disaster in the
storm which raged for a couple of hours
along the northern coast last night was
brought to the city this evening. "With the
bodies of two men still lashed to her bot
tom, a two-masted top-deck schooner was
towed into port by tha steamer Defiance.
How many men had been aboard the ves
sel besides the two who died from expos
ure It is impossible- to discover. Neither
tody has been identified, and their vessel
is not known in Vancouver, harbor. L
The. schooner is about forty feet long
and '.was apparently used .for trading
along the coast. Her : , deckhouse couid
easily accommodate Â¦ a half dozen men.
Her name had, been painted out, and, as
she is still bottom up, what is contained
in her hold cannot be ascertained until
morning. ? .. .
The Defiance pfeked up the vessel early
this morning at the entrance "to- Howe
Sound, fifteen miles from Vancouver. The
masts of the schooner had been broken
off and she had otherwise been badly
damaged. . . , \ N
. The first blow probably made her turn
turtle and those of her crew -who were
able climbed Â¦ upon her â¢ bottom. The
bodies-of the two men.wero tied on se
curely. The lashing mufet havÂ£ been done
by a third person, Â«o that at least one
other, man was drowned.
The hulk brought in to-night is not the
one sighted yesterday off Carmanah
Light. That derelict was right side up
and at least' one corpse could be seen
lashed to the rigging.

SACRAMENTO, March 4.â Searchers
who had gone out into the overflow in
the hope of learning something of the
fate of the five young men who had left
Courtland In a sailboat on Sunday were
rewarded Late this afternoon by* finding
the empty boat far from the shore. The
live young men who had embarked in the
boat were: Dr. J. H. Morton, aged 26;
Clarence Casterson, aged 22; George
Xunes. aged 18; Elmer Ivey, aged 22, and
Knight Lellington, aged 19.
Word was sent to Courtland of the sig
nificant discovery and a. fleet of small
boats, equipped with grappling Irons,
braved the strong current to aid in tho
search for the bodies. To-night the bodies
of three of the missing menâ those of
CJeorg'e Nunes, Clarence Casterson and
Dr. J. H. Mortonâ were brought to the
surface, that of Casterson from beneath
the boa't and the others a short distance
from the craft. This discovery revealed
only too plainly the sad fate that had
overtaken the entire party. The search
will continue. all night and it is believed
that the other bodies will be recovered in
the \-icinity before to-morrow.
The point where the boat was found
and where the three bodies were brought
up from the water was one mile and a
half from the shore, almost directly west
of Courtland, and in the Yolo Basin,
which is now a veritable inland sea.
Hears Shouting in the Night.
The young men left Courtland at 2
o'clock Sunday afternoon, partly to view
ihe scenes incidental to the high water,
but more especially to enable Dr. Morton
to viEit a patient named Johnson, who
had been living on the shore of Suiter
Slough. They did not return and the
alarm grew when Monday came and went
without tidings from the party except
the statement of a man named Le MounÂ«
tain, who reported that on Sunday after
noon he had teen the boat with the men
in it about seven miles from the river on
the overflow. It was learned that John
pon had moved away from Sutter Slough
and that Dr. Morton had not seen -him.
In view of to-day's tragic developments
a story told yesterday by a Chinese liv
ing on Sutter Slough suggests painful
probabilities. He said that about 2
o'clock on Monday morning he heard de
spairing cries coming far across the over
flow. Again an hour later the cries came
to his ears. He stood and listened, but
from the distance and the darkness he
could not determine their import. Pres
ontly the cries grew fainter and then died
away altogether. The Chinese indicated
to the searchers whence the cries came
:nd the locality was the same as that in
which the empty boat and the bodies of
Morton. Nunes and" Casterson were
J'ound. \
The statement of the Chinese would
maice. it appear that the five young men
<~lung to the half-sunken boat as long as
they could, meanwhile sending their
<riÂ«*s for help across the water until one
after the otfrper through exhaustion re
leased his grip and was drowned.
BoaÂ£ Heavily Weighted.
The boat was intended to be used for
Tab fishing in San Francisco Bay. About
S f| 0 pounds of lead had been attached to
the keel. The boat was seawoithy
enough, but the heavy would pre
vent Its keeping afloat should it land on
r snag or other obstruction, as it seems
vrae the case. The boat when found was
thr^-quartors under water, the bow
being exposed eight or nine Inches. The
water at this point was about sixteen feet
dfep. *
All the young men resided In Courtland
find were of excellent character. Dr.
Morton was a. practicing: physician there.
They were all unmarried. Of the five
'â¢nly Nuncs. Ivey and Lellington could
swim.
It was reported this afternoon that
Grant Grlgsby and Byron Keller, two
market hunters of Sacramento, had been
lost in the Yolo overflow, the report aria
ing from the finding of some of their out

At a recent meeting of the Trustees
Ware obtained a new -lease of much
longer duration. The entire bottom and
sides of the pool are to be lined with
bitumen and the depth of the water will
be from three to nine feet. The tank will
be so constructed that the contents will
be emptied and replenished each day.-
In the heart of this city there Is a
natural reservoir. It is adjacent to San
Rafael Creek and at high tide is always
filled with salt water, while at ebb tide
It is emptied. Two years ago C. P. Ware 1
conceived the Idea that the reservoir
could be converted Into a salt water
swimming pool. He received from the
city trustees a five-year lease of thin
property. Bathhouses were constructed
and eventually opened to the public. The
gravel bottom and the ehallowness of the
pool, however, prevented the success of
the venture.
SAN RAFAEL, March 4.â San Rafael is
soon to have the largest swimming tank
in California. It will be more than 600
feet long and 200 feet wide. It will con.
tain ocean water and will be filled and
emptied by means of sluice gates.' Being
located on tide water the ebb and flow of
the tide will act in lieu of a pumping

Last evening Eagle got' tired of com
pany of the detectives and started out on
a little excursion of his own. He visited
many places in the tenderloin and spent
money freely. He met a tall man, who
lectured him severely about his behavior,
and told him that as he was Chief of Po
lice he would take his money for safe
keeping for the night. Eagle parted will
ingly with $400 In cash, a gold watch and
two diamond rings worth $200 each. This
morning he called on the real Chief of
Police to thank him for the safekeeping
of his property and learned that he had
been victimised. Later in the" day the
police found that Eagle's watch chain,
made of gold nuggets, had been cut up
and sold to a local Jewelry firm by a man
who represented himself as a Klondlker.
This is all that has been heard of Eagle's

there was a violent trembling of the loco
motive, twice repeated. The explosion
followed a second later. The roar of tha
expanding steam could be heard for miles
around, and residents of the vicinity hur
ried to the scene. They found Engineer
Dugan fully_ twenty-five yards from the
track. He' was still breathing, but died
within a few minutes. In one hand ho
Btlll clutched a piece of the lever. Strange
to say, the dying, man's watch had not

had been hurled some distance > from the

his way into the caboose. He was
scalded from head to foot by the escaping
steam. This afternoon he was taken to

Captain Titus -further writes that Court

street on October 8, last year. She waa
shot in the eye and died a few hours
later. Courtney was living with the wo
man along with two companions, both
red-headed and each with only one leg.
Every effort was made to arrest Court
ney and his companions without success,
and it was only, when Titus received a
letter from Captain Seymour asking for
information about Courtney that his iden
tity was discovered.
. Chief -Kiely of St. Louis has also writ
ten to Captain Seymour that Courtney
was one of a gang of tramps who mur
dered Officer Nicholas Hunt there on No
vember 15, 1S97. The chief of the gang
was John" Fraser alias Knight alias "Tip,"
who made his escape on a river steamer
going to Memphis. There he was met by
Courtney and Bert Scalen, two members
of the gang.
A dispatch was received last rnght from
' Winnipeg, Manitoba, stating that the Ca
nadian Pacific detectives and Western
Ontario police were on the trail ol Wil
liam Kauffman, one of the murderers of
Police Officer Robinson, and expected to
capture him at any moment.'.:
The highwayman has been working East
on the main line of the Canadian Pacific
Railroad and was in Winnipeg March *1.
He was in Calgary, N. W. T.. 'February.

Vancouver. He spent two days in Cal
gary, but escaped arrest; owing to the po
lice there not having received the neces
sary instructions and information from

scription of the much-wanted fugitive was
put off a train by Conductor Downing of
the Atlantic express while at English
River station, one hundred miles west of
Winnipeg. He was beating his way on the
train. After being put off he tried to se

The franchise for an electric road from
the northern limit of Redding to the
county line towar4 Weaverville, with a
branch to Keswick, and from the south
ern limit of Redding to tne county line
toward Red Bluff, was sold by the Super
visors this afternoon to Attorney W. D.
Tlllotson, who declines to state whom he
represents. .
'The contract for construction has ac
tually, teen let to- Drake & Stratton of
,New York City," said Mr. Proctor. "We
cannot say yet just when or at what
point operations will first commence, but
that will be determined during the week
that we shall spend in Redding. Every
thing is fully arranged in a general way.
We are now attending to the details.'.'
Mr. Proptor confirms â¢ the" statement
that the project has already 525,000,000 at
command. His principal object here at
this time is to view the land with Lord
Thurlow and determine the exact route
which the road shall follow in crossing
Trinity and Western Shasta County into
Redding. They will investigate a right
of way through the town. A proposition
to receive attention is just what route the
road shall follow on leaving Redding. A
very slight detour from the most direct
course would carry it by Bully Hill,
where Captain de la Mar's great copper
mines and smelters are located. It is be
lieved that the heavy volume of business
which' could be thus obtained will make
this mining center a depot on the road.
In driving from Red Bluff. the railroad
projectors obtained an idea of some of
the country to be traversed. Tne road
will go out through the northeastern cor
ner of the county, traversing fertile Fall
River Valley, with Its great wheat acre
age, vast stock ranges, thousands of
acres of magnificent timber and a wide
mineral section.
REDDING, March 4.â Lord Thurlow of
London and New York and George H.
Proctor of New York, who Js associated

prises, arrived here this afternoon. Their
visit here concerns the Eureka and East

Eureka to Redding and thence northeast
to Weiser, on the Idaho and Oregon line,
250 miles south of Spokane, from which
point J. J. Hill of the Great -Northern Is
expected to extend a branch. Lord â¢Thur

Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for more, sickness and suffering

trouble'ls permitted to continue,- FATAL RESULTS ARE SURE TO FOLLOW.
We often see a relative, a friend, or an acquaintance apparently well .â¢ but in

caused by that fatal type of kidney troubleâ Blight's Disease.
The mild and extraordinary effect of the great kidney and bladder remedy.

knowledge. \ She was formerly with the St. Louis Baptist Hospital and has had
many trying experiences in her arduous vocation. She adds her valuable testi-
mony to the thousands already received by Swamp-Root. She said In a signed
interview with a Reporter of the St. Louis Star:
"Although a woman in my position can receive plenty of prescriptions from
physicians without cost, it was upon the 1 advice of a well-known West End Doc-
tor that I began to take Swamp-Root. No, I will not tell you his name, for , ha
might not like It. - But all the same, I took it when I was run down â¢ from night
work in the sick room. I was thin and yellow and tired even when I rose from my
sleep. Swamp-Root gave me a relish for my food and cleared my blood from it3
stagnant impurities. Of course I do not praise , Swamp-Root as a cure for all
troubles, but it is splendid for the kidneys, stomach and bowels and relieves fe-
male disorders when all other remedies have failed to i?ive relief. ' I know . of
many cases in the hospital cured Â¦, by this wonderful remedy. ,

Charles R. Mains, prisoner and de
fendant on a charge of using the malls
for fraudulent purposes, achieved a legal
victory yesterday when United States
District Judge de Haven dismissed the in
dictment against him and his alleged ac
complice, Walter Scott Glfford. on the
motion made by Mains a few days ago.
In rendering his opinion Judge de Haven
said that there was but one count in the
indictment, charging the defendants with
having deposited two letters In the United.-
States Postoffice for tho purpose of carry-,
ing out a scheme to defraud. The statute
under which the defendants are indicted"
makes each letter deposited in the pan
office for the purpose of carrying out a
fraudulent scheme a distinct offense. Con
tinuing, Judge de Haven said:
It Is an elementary rule ot criminal law
pleading that two or more separate offenses
cannot be Joined In a single count. The In
dictment is also defective for the reason t'jat
the letters are not properly pleaded. There Is
no direct allegation as to the substance of jjteit
contents.
The charges in the quashed indictment
were ordered referred to the Grand Jury
to be hereafter impaneled. "Mains -was
thereupon held to answer with ball fixed
at $1500. Gifford 13 at large. on his own
recognizance. He i will be used as a wit
ness by the Government.

Indictment Quashed on Motion

yesterday on .a charge of grand larceny.
Wilson met E. R. Lane^ a young New
ZefUander, February 19^ and Induced him
to accompany him to a house on Taylor
street to get a permit to visit the Mint.
There Lane was introduced to -a "Major"
and "Doctor 1 '' who were playing poker.
Lane was invited to play and. said he did
not understand any game of cards except
euchre. Wilson, offered to stand hla spon
sor, and three hands - were dealt ' and
sealed in envelopes. Wllsoii went to a
bank with Lane, who drew but $3M), and
returned with him to the house on Tay
lor street. Larre put up the $300 on the
hand dealt him, and when the envelopes
were opened he was told that he. had lost.
Wilson pretended to take pity on him and
gave him a certificate for D00 shares of
mining stock with a letter of introduc
tion to "Major Van Pelt. Hotel Butler,
Seattle," yfho would buy. the stock. Lane
went to Seattle and of course no one
knew "Major Van Pelt." Lane' then re
turned to this city and notified the po-
Jice of the robbery. After Wilson's arrest
a woman claiming to be his wife called
upon Lane and gave him $150. begging
him not to testify against her husband.

PHOENIX, A, T., March 4,-News
reached here this morning of a battle be
tween a large force of Yaqui Indians and
a troop of Mexican rangers, under the
command of Colpnel Navarro, near Petaco,
a small pueblo 10 miles east of Guaymas.
The Rangers were ambushed, but,man
aged to reach a stone corral and from
that barricade poured a deadly flre into
the Indian forces.
After two hours' shooting the Yaquis
retired, leaving six of their "number dead
on the field. Three Mexicans were
wounded.
Navarro's force had for two weeks been
in pursuit of a large band of Yaqui rene
gades, which was "rustling" cattle along
the Sierra MÂ»dre range. It is believed
that this band makes up the remnant of
the Yaqui warring forces. Reinforcements
from Ucrmosillo have been sent to Na

One of the greatest finds ever recorded in
the Klondike was made yesterday. In one
day Richard Butler took $15,000 out of a
claim on Bear Creek â No. 13 above Dis
covery. A second bedrock, only Jive feet
below the ordinary bedrock, which was
worked last -reason, was found. The dis
covery caused great excitement in the vi
cinity and to-day every claim on the creek
cthat had been worked during the winter
' was being prospected again to tap the sec
ond bedrock.
Six hundred dollars' worth of nuggets
were taken from one pan of pay dirt,
while other pans " yielded considerably
more than $10u each. The gold was ex
hibited in Dawson to-day.
Butler is an old-time miner. He would
have Abandoned the claim in a day or two
for , the winter if he had not found the
new bedrock.

Walter J. Thompson has petitioned the
Board of Education fox reinstatement - to
his position as janitor pÂ£ the Lowell High
School. Thompson ;â¢ has ; been out since
January, 1900, owing to injuries received
through a fall while in the discharge of
his duty, so he. claims. Principal Frank
P. Morton has a different story to tell.''
Janitor Thompson claims that Morton
was overbearing in his demands, going
bo far as to Insist upon having a fire In
his office on hia'arrival in the morning.
Thompson made constant requests for a
key to the office, which he claims Mortpn
ilid- as constantly refuse, so" the' janitor
was obllffed to obtain access to the pri
vate office, through a window from an ad-
Joining' room.
One morning while climbing along the
damp ledge hÂ« nlipped and fell a distance
of thirty feet, falling on a stairway and
fracturing the boneu of his .shoulder ami
rltfht leg*. Because of the injuries thus
tiuÂ»talneU he was laid up for monthsv Â¦
Â¦Mo-rton says in defense. that tho reason
he refused to give up a key was becauao
he had K many valuables in hla office and
he and the vice principal were the only
ones who had keys at any time. lie de
clares that for twelve years no request
had been made by the .lanitors* for keys
to his private â¢ office. He says that ho
thought nothing, of Janitor Thompson'**
dally hpuse-climbing feat, as Mrs. Thomp
son had told him that her husband used
to be 1 a painter and didn't mind It at all. .
The petition for reinstatement haa been
laid on -the table, pending the result ot

NOT TO WORRY
The $1500 Gunst handicap ia the special
feature of an excellent card at Oakland
to-day. Among the starters are Joe Prey,
Janice, The Fretter, Frangible and Mac-
Gyle.
On Saturday next the rich Bell stakes
for two-year-oldH comes up for deci^on.
Fully a dozen or the smartest youngsters
in training will sport silk.
JessÂ© Matthews, who has beeA" on . the
Bick list for some time, rode, Jennie Reid,
winner of the first race at long? odds.
Gaviota is likely to prove us fast as
Sevens*, aluo a daughter of imp. Crichton.
Both were bred at the Napa Stock Farm.
After his race yesterday, the conclusion
must be reached that" Duckoy is no weight
packfr.
If Lav Jackson were a pilot. on one, of
thfs bay steamers and couldn't ,"duck"
Goat Island oftener than he ,dld the
muddy ' spotH - with Meehanus, his first
trick at the wheel would find the South
ern Pacific Company with one, less boat.
Many contend that Articulate ia A quit
ter and that even if Birkenruth had got
the brown colt away from the post in' the
Burns handicap ho would havo tossed, it
up at the end of a mile. Yesterday's race
does not bear out such statements, i
As stated in The Call : some days ago;
Johnny Uullman will HiJe the coming sea
son for August Belmont, and leaves for
New York this forenoon. He. receives a
retainer of $12,000, besides getting paid for
winning and losing mounts. ' Green Morris
has secured second call-on Bullman's ser
vices for ,$G0OO. This: Jboks; as if 'all the
money wasnot to be madÂ© in Europe.
Both The Gaffer and Alturas were well
played. to finish among the first three in
the last race. They didn't.
A. Kelly rode a very vigorous race on
L.en Reno. He should Join the Teamsters'
Union without delay.-
Horatius . had no chance to win,', stumb

vorite. At the start Birkenruth drew
away from his field with Gusto, and al
though he picked the deep going next the
rail the brown gelding lasted long enough
to down the favorite half a length. Show
honors fell to Midnight' Chimes.
Six "baby" racers "faced the barrier in
the two-year-old dash at three and a halt
furlongs. Gaviota, the fast filly from the
Spreckels stable, with Johnny Woods In
the saddle, had first call in the. betting,
and she won with comparative ease. Hua*
eon led Into the Btretch. where the faÂ»
vorjte collared arid beat her hands down.
Dotterel was completely outfooted, rum
ning a poor third.
Floronso was sent to the post ap even
money favorite for the mile and a six
teenth event with O'Connor up In about
as good condition as a legless man would
be for a prize waltz. His speed gave
away early and the old cripple finished
last. Wolhurst looked to be winning
when Jackson on Siddons came with a
well-timed rush, scoring by two open
lengths. The winner was a 9 to 1 shot.
Galanthus ran a fair third.
Apparently fresh.as a May flower after
his bard campaign of .last week, Phil
Archibald won the closing mile selling af
fair in a gallop from Legal Maxim. The
latter three-year-old ruled favorite and
.cut out the running, only to be. passed and
defeated without effort . when Troxler
astride Archibald, got ready. Â¦
Track Notes.
SCOTT LEARY and II. F. Brewer,
the Olympic Athletic Club swim
mers, are the lions of the hour in
the big Post-street institution
. since their return from triumphs
at the sportsman's show, Chicago. â¢ .
Out of a total of nearly forty races they
lost but one, heary being defeated by
ScnaeJTer, the Eastern champion. In ex
planation of his defeat lie says he was
far from being -at his best. Neither
swimmer was in racing condition during
the tournament, which makes the vari
ous performances all the* better. The
weather was cold, a condition entirely op
posite to what they have been accus
tomed to. : , ; , /
Leary captured all the American short
distance records, while Brewer accounted
for those at longer distances with the ex-
ception of the mile. He Is eager. to se
cure this, and it Is possible he wiU f undei>
take the feat in the Olympic Club swim
ming: tank.
Leary is a protege of Sidney CavlU, tha
swimming instructor at thp Olympic Club.
The latter saw he had taleiu and appllca
cation and taught him the proper mettle
1 ods of propulsion In the water.' That
Cavlll's judgment was excellent la shown

Free trial packages of a most re/nark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who

for years against the mental and physical
f-uffering of Io6t manhood that the Insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment, and all men who suffer from
&ny form of eexual weakness resulting:
Jrom youthful folly, premature loss of
fctrength and memory, weak back, varicc-
<cle or emaciation of parts can now cure
ihr-xneelvos at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development Just where it Is needed
It cures all the ills' and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the natural
functions and has been an absolute suc-
cess in all cases. A request to the State
Modlcal Institute, 328 Elektron bulldine

one of their free trial packages will ba !
complied with promptly. The Institute is
desirous of reaching that great class of
iuen who are unable to leave home to be
treated, and the free samples will enable
tnem to see how easy It Is to be cured of
r-.cxual weakness when tho proper reme-
dies are employed. The Institute makes
no restrictions. Any man who writes will
he sent a free sample, carefully sealed in
a plain package, so that its recipient need
have no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write
without delay.

WASHINGTON. March 4.-The ship
subsidy bill was again discussed In the
Senate to-day by Frye. His remarks were
directed principally to the Republican
Senators, and he gave further expression
to his views that the subsidy bill was a
logical response to the demands and
principles of the Republican party and
that In its preparation he had obviated
the objections entertained by Senators
friendly to the measure.
No other Senators desiring to qneak to
day, the bill was laid aside and a' number
of other bills were paaned.

We walked with her as far as Mission and
Krench streets, where we left her ami returned
to the house. I did not nee her again until
the next day,
Escorted Her to Corner.
After we rot back we remained about the
housH for a few minutes. Frank and I then
started with Mrs. Kilbourn for the cars.
Mrs. Kilbourn reached the Morrisey house
about. O d. m. December 15. She was intoxi
cated. She wore no hat. her clothes were dis
ordered and dirty and her hair was disheveled.
She showed her arm, which she 'said was
broken, to Mrs. MorrLsey, Â»nd Frank's mother
dressed It, putting on liniment and bandage*.
Morrisey and I shortly after her arrival went
out to look for her hat. We searched about
the Dlace where she said she had fallen, but
could not find It, and then returned to the
house.
Thomas Crouch, a chum of the defend
ants ana who was present at the Mor
risey home when Mrs. Kilbourn arrived
there after her rough Journey across the
vacant lots, was the first witness placed
on the stand by the defense. Crouch said;
Martin J. Flynn and Frank Morrisey,
who are being tried in Judge Troutt's
court for' assaulting Mrs. Rose Kilbourn
of Santa Rosa on the night of December
15. were witnesses in their own behalf
yesterday. Both [ the ; young men told
seemingly straight stories of their doings
on the night of the alleged assault, but
contradicted in many instances the testi
mony they gave In their preliminary ex
aminations before Judge Mogan. â¢

REVERE MEMORY
OF A MARTYR
Eloquent the Tribute to
Rob9rt Emmet by
His Countrymen.
The memory of Robert Emmet, the Irish
patriot and martyr, was fittingly hon
ored last night by the Knights of tho
Red Branch at Metropolitan Hall.
Robert Emmet was born In Dublin. Ire
land, in 1778. and was a colleague of
Thomas Moore's at Trinity College, DubÂ»
lin. Both were members of tho Historical
Society and champions ' of the people.
Emmet was expelled from the university
on the ground that he was connected with
the Association of United Irishmen. He
then went to the Continent, but returned
secretly to Dublin to plan an Irish revo
lution. On the 23d of July, 1S02. he thought
the time to act had come and with hij
band of faithful followers attempted to
seize the arsenal and capital of Dublin,
but failed. Emmet tied from the country,
but on returning to visit his sweetheart
was captured, charged with treason, con
victed and sentenced to death. He de
fended himself In a speech of remarKabio
eloquence, but was hungeti in Si. Thomas
street. Dublin, on September 20. 1SOÂ«. - Al
though Emmet's conduct was rash, tho
high purity and unselfishness of hta in.
tentions have never been questioned, and
his name la to this <lay honored in every
Irish home.

Louis Glass, vice president of the Pa
cific â¢ States Telephone and . Telegraph
Company, appeared before the Jury to ex
plain why the telephone service had be
come poorer, as the number of sub
scribers had been Increased. Glass was
questioned particularly regarding the ex
asperating tactics of the big corporation
on the ten party lines. Glass explained
the difficulties with which the company
had to contend and then invited the Grand
Jury to Inspect the system.
The congestion of traffic on the street
cars was also discussed and the jury will
recommend that the street railway com
panies be prohibited from maintaining
"stopping plates". In the middle of the
street. 1*he Jurors are of the opinion that
such plates should be on . the sidewalk
curbs and not In the street, where the
passenger Is in imminent danger of pass
ing vehicles. The Grand Jurors will com
municate the result of their investiga
tions on the subjects , mentioned to the
Board of Supervisors. - â¢â¢â¢
Poor Telephone System.
Foreman Sonntag stated that tho Grand
Jury would brook no. trifling In the mat
ter and advised Mendell to urge the
Board of Works to enforce the ordinance
now In effect. Regarding the fences and
other obstructions allowed to exist In the
University Mound, Bay View and other
suburban districts, Mendell Bald no action
was taken, as the matter Is now in court
and will Boon be adjudicated.
Colonel Mendell was sharply questioned
regarding what the Grand Jury terms a
dereliction of duty ajid was Informed that
Mayor Schmltz was displeased at tho Im
mense proportions which street obstruc
tions' had assumed. Mendell explained
that an ordinance was now being prepared
for submission to the Board of . Super
visors In order to cover the case.
Colonel Menriell, president ef the Heard
>>t i'uiiitt' Wurka, iii>i>Â«u>ini to explain why
that immi,v iiiH-fi not enforce the ordinance

Foreman Bonntag explained that the Po
lice Committee uf the Grand Jury had
found that the ordinance wnÂ« being vio
lated, especially In the downtown district.
The r.iiiuniitr,. had waited on the Chief
ef Police and requested that he direct the
police officers lo notify all persons obÂ«
eti-uctltig the streets to remove the ob
structions forthwith. The men served no*
tlces on the ofTctiederfl and then the Board
of Works asked tho Chief of Police to de
sist, as the board was considering plans
to remedy the matter.
Beard of Works on the UÂ«ek.
Crime U on the Int reuse. Frequently, some
of our citizens are brutally beaten and robbed
and sometimes murdered and many homes are
entered by burglars, and in a number of sec
tlons of the illy tht* lives nt Ilia residents are
not safe outdoors aflar nlglmall. The i.ni
tectton of the pernons and property of our mil
Â¦em from the largo number of criminals at
present In this city should receive your ninBl
earnest attention, Ileslflents In various parts
of the city, end particularly in the suburbs,
are clamoring; for police protection, which the
department t* unable tt> furnish bewnune it tmt
not enough men,

Bays Crime Is Increasing.
The street patrolmen are divided into two
waichea, relieving each other at mated Inter*
m.Ik and k.j arranged that one-halt uf tho force
Ik on duty the tlrat l-ulr of the night and the
rwnaliid.ftiie latter half. In the downtown or
l.u.sim/KH dlhtrlcta ut the city the beaU or tours
of duty o( the patrolmen will average from
eight to ten block* In length,, while In the rrm
dence districts they arc much longer. In some
It. stances the men must . patrol thirty-two
blocks to go over their beats. Kvon then there
ore neveral section* of the city which have no
protection whatever. Among these are the Pre
hidlo Heights district, which Is rapidly build
ing up with lino residences, and the Bunset
district, which Is becoming thickly 'Populated.
That section of the city south of UalKlit street
and west of Central uvenue haw also no patrol;
many square miles of the . thickly populated
Mission district Is aim .without police protec
tion; the Potrero and South Hun Francisco dis
trict have not one-fourth enough police; the
tnmÂ« Is true of the rapidly growing Hlchmqnd
district; the section north of Union street and
west of Hyde needs pollco badly, and morn
officers are needed in the water front districts,
and also more mounted police In the suburbs.
The Grand Jury met -yesterday and for
warded a communication to the Mayor
and Hoard of Supervisors recommending
that provision be made In the next tax
levy' tor an Increase In tho police 'force.
The communication calls attention to the
fact that no Increase In the force bas been
made since October, 1891, and that as'thi
clty'tt .bUmut(<l population In 400,000 tho
need of additional patrolmen la urgent.
Thcro are now only Lou patrolmen, though
the charter ii.vch the strength of the Po
lieu Department at one policeman for
every 5oO of population, which would en
title the city to 184 additional policemen.

AS FARMERS VIEW IT.
It is noted furthermore that the bulk of the new
immigration docs not go into the west and the
touth to build up the country, but gathers into large
cities, where it produces a congestion of the labor
market and forms an alien element difficult to absorb,
Tor these and other reasons based upon the facts, the
Immigration Restriction League is earnestly press
ing its bill upon Congress, There can be no ques
tion of the need of some measure of restriction and
Ihe one prnpm-cd certainly merits a trial.
A recent analysis of the census statistics of 1900
fchows the extent to which immigration from Ger
many. Ireland nnd Great Britain is falling off, while
that from the east and the south of Europe is in
creasing. It appears that during the decade between
1890 and 1900 the number of Germans in the United
States decreased from 2,784,894 to 2,666,990, and the
number of Irish decreased from 1,871,509 to 1,618,567.
In 1900 the population of thisÂ«country included 841,
967 English, 93,682 Welsh, 233.077 Scotch, 785,958
Canadians of British origin and 6851 Australians.
The Baltimore Sun estimates that the total of former
Mibjccts of Great Britain in the United States in
1900 was 3,876,299. The elements that have mate
rially increased in our population since 1890 arc as
follows: Italians, 484.207, an increase of 301,627;
Swedes, 573.040, an increase of 94.999; Russians, 424,
096, an increase of 241,452; Poles, 383.510, an increase
of 236,070: Austrians, 276,249, an increase of 152,978;
Bohemians, 156.991, an increase of 38,885, and Hun
garians, 145,802. an increase of 83,367.
The argument in support of the bill is based upon
the fact that very few immigrants from northern and
western Kuropc arc unable to read their own lan
guage, while those from eastern and southern Europe
*hosc coming is not desirable arc very largely il
literate, *o that the educational test would exclude
most of the objectionable immigration. During the
last three years the proportion of illiterates migrating
from western Europe was 3.6 per cent, 4.2 per cent
and 5.0 per cent. The percentage among the immi
grants from eastern Europe in the same three years
was ,37.0 per cent, JO* .'4 per cent and 4,3.2 per cent.
ThoÂ»e factf have routed the Immigration Kefrtrie
lion League to renewed cffortu to procure frem
<- <<ii, ;i < â¢-Â¦- the enactment of a nutigfaetory restriction
law, ThcyTifk for un educational teÂ»t. The bill pre*
I iiicd by, the lc;i|jtic nnd which they arc now urging
excludes .nil persons over is years of age nnd physi
cally capable "f rending, who cannot read the English
IthgtuTge or some other language; but an ndmissiblc
immigrai t or a person now in or hereafter admitted
to this country may bring in or send for his wife,
his children under 18 years of age, and his parents
or grandparents aver 50 years of age, if they are
otherwise admissible, whether they arc 50 able to
lead or not.
SINCE J&>8 the total annual immigration into
the United States has more than doubled. In
that year it wiÂ» 2^9,^99, while laet year it was
4$7,<jift, As is well known, the character of the im
migration has been tlmnging for the worse, and we
have been receiving an increasingly large proportion
of illiterate)!. In 180H the proportion of what may
be termed "undesirable immigrants" was 57 per
cent, but !Â¦<Â¦! year the immigration of that Â» U~^
.Â¦'mounted to nearly (*) per cent.
IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION.
Such is the Democratic situation. Mr. Hill's plat
form does very well for New York, but neither the
West. nor the South look upon it with favor. As a
matter, of fact Democracy as at present organized iÂ§
out of date. It has no harmony upon any phase
of the vital issues of the time. So long ns it. remains
as it is it can accomplish nothing. No platform can
finite, if, no leader; can lead it Â¦ â¢
. Upon the, question of regulating combinations,
there are evidences of djsagrecment. Some of the
leading Southern oppose, any such legisla
tion. The Louisville Courier, Journal for example
recently presented a striking series of figures show
ing the benefits accruing to railways and to the
country by consolidations, It says: "In 1891,
twenty-six railroad companies went into bankruptcy;
in 1896, thirty-two roads; in 1897, seventy-four roads,
nnd so on up to and including iqoi, when in all 230
railroad systems had become bankrupt, with a mile
age of 58,563 miles and a total cnpltnlixntion of $g,J
26,1,680,000, ' The history of those times need not be
dwelt siipon, Suffice it to say that, by means of re
organisation and consolidation the roads were ; once
more placed upon their' feet, and by the community
of 'interest' plan rates were given stability and busi
ness became profitable."'
The money question, however, is not the only
feature of the Hill platform which will provoke dis
cord in the party ranks. The demand for the ex
tension jof the constitution and free trade to the
Philippines will not be supported by a good many
of the Southern Democrats. Senator Forakcr's
amendment to the Philippine tariff bill reducing the
Dinglcy duties was opposed by no less' than seven
teen Democratic Senators who with twenty-nine Re
publicans made up the majority that rejected it. If
those men arc opposed to a 50 per cent reduction in
duties that protect Southern agriculture /rom Phil
ippine competition, they are not likely to support
complete free trade either with those islands or'with
other countries. . . y .'
That statement clearly discloses an intention on
the part of the silver champion to renew the money
issue nt the meeting of the next convention of his
party, and while he is now too .discredited to have
any chance of a rcnomination, it is by no means cer
tain that he cannot make a winning fight so far as
reaffirming 'the silver platform is concerned, and he
may even be strong enough to determine who shall
be the party candidate.
When questioned about the platform proposed by
Hill, Mr. Bryan said he had not yet read the speech,
but thnt it is ns yet toe early to formulate platforms.
He ndded! "The Kansas City platform will be reaf
firmed and the party will also present such other
questions as the time and, the public welfare dictate.
Those who supported Mr. McKinley, the foremost
apostle of the high tariff doctrine, will find it difficult
to make the public believe that they regard the tariff
as an important question. The Democratic party oc
cupies the position on this question that it has for
years past, but it is not likely, in my opinion, to be
the paramount issue in the near future."
Reduced to its simplest expression Hill's plntform
proposes nn abandonment of the silver question, and
the substitution of tariff reform as the chief issue of
the camppign, adding to it ft 'demand that the con
stitution should follow the flag and that legislation
should be enacted in reitraint of combinations of
capital threatening the general welfare. Short as
that creed is, there is little prospect 'that the Demo
cratic parly ng nt present constituted can be united
upon it, There are Democrats who are still for free
silver, others who are opposed to tariff reductions,
and Mil! others who arc not in favor of any kind of
political tinkering with the industrial development
which has brought about the great cdrporatlons of
the time.
ONLY a few days have elapsed since David
Bennett Hill made, before the Manhattan
Club in New York* his plea for Democratic
harmony and offered a platform upon which he
deemed it possible for harmony to be brought about;
but short as is the time, it has been ample for the ap
pearance of objections in various quarters and for a
new demonstration of discord in the party ranks
upon almost every issue of importance now before
the country. ,
DEMOCRATIC DISCORD.
Mr. Wells is not a dogmatist. In the lecture in
which he made this suggestion of the coming of a
new race he told his. audience that every man has a
right to be his own prophet, so those who do not like
to believe that man will be eventually succeeded by
a higher race who will treat him as we treat monkeys
may believe something else. The field of the future
is wide. There is room for alj the prophets. ,.
Mr. Wells went on, however, to point out that there
is another factor in the problem, a factor 'which repre
sents an unknown quantity, which cannot be calcu
lated nnd which may change the whole course of
events. It is in dealing with this factor that he is
most interesting. He suggests that the human race
is not the final and highest form of being that is to
live on the earth. Exactly as man developed from
the lower animals, so there may be a higher animal
evolve frcm man. This new development, he says,
may come at any time, and we may even npw note
around us evidences of a deliberate improvement in
the blood- and the brain of men. In truth, says Mr.
Wells, it is quite possible to. believe that all the past
history of man is but a beginning of something that
is yet to come; all that the mind has accomplished is
but a dream before the awakening; we arc creatures
of the twilight; and the man of the full splendor of the
day is yet to be evolved out of the sufferings of the
race that now exists.
Qt nil the forecasters of the day II, G, Wells, holds
the foreniofrt place by reason of the fact thai Im has
written n'ore entertainingly nnd more scientifically
Hi. in any of his competitor*. Mo/cover, he Advances
by far the moat interesting theory, Iri a recent Icje
ture lii London on "The Discovery of the 'Aiture," lie
{irgued that within certjrin qualifications nnd llmltB*
lions u working knowledge of the developments of
the future i* quite possible to human reason. Wo
have now n fairly comprehensive knowledge of the
forces in operation upon society, we can estimate with
an approach to accuracy their mutual action and re
action upon one another, nnd we have also a good
understanding of the ' human material! upon which
those forces arc to operate; therefore, if men of first
class ability should undertake to reason out the future
of any particular race they would probably approxi
mate the truth.
In the old times the prophets claimed to speak by
divine inspiration. Later on they professed to fore
cast the future through philosophical reasoning. In
our time the prophets speak* in the name of science,
nnd even when they nre not themselves scientists
they use the forms of scientific argument and base
their prediction* upon truth* which have been icien
tifteally demonstrated.
DESPITE the known futility of.all speculations'
or guesses at the future of the human race,
men are* never weary of them,. From the
carliest*agcs of which we have any record down to
our own time there have been prophets of woe of, of
bliss concerning the coming .time, and for every
prophet ' there has been an attentive and \ interested
audience.

THE REJECTED SWORD,
To the specious plea of "charity for Cuba," the
argument of the farmers was simple. "We believe
that charity should begin at home. We should first
take care of our, own people and then consider the
welfare of the peoples of other countries.'" When
asked if the Grange had taken action upon the ques
tion, the reply of the chairman was: "Not upon
this specific matter, but upon the broad ground I
have stated it stands as a unit." Then, came the
question: "Do the free trade farmers think we ought
to make an exception in favor of farm products?"
To that the Grange delegate replied promptly and
pithily: "The free trade farmers think that while
protection is the policy of, the Government they
should have their share of it. They are not fools
enough to object to that." '
Such arc the views of farmers on the reciprocity
question. Whether protectionists or free traders on
general principles they are as a unit against a scheme
that would admit foreign farm products free of duty
while granting protection to other " interests. The
reciprocity schemers will do- well to take note of
the fact. The farmers are not fools.
It i* to be noted that the representatives ef the
Grange did Hot speak solely for the sugar growing
industry, nor, as special representatives of that inter
est. The chairman saldt "I 'do not raise any sugar
beetsâ have no interest in nny sugar factory. I speak
for the general interests of the farmers erf the lanll,
and for the general prosperity of the country.. If we
can get some of the farmers to diversify their crops
and withdraw from the grain growing and from the
stock raising business, to some extent, and engage
in growing sugar beets, it would 1 reduce competition
and be to the best interests of all. I also believe that
this Government should foster the industry of agri
culture as it fosters and encourages other industries
of this country."
That iÂ§:g@iind pr@teetive doetrine. It iÂ§ in fuel the
only principle upon whieh a pretfitive tariff ean be
maintained am@ng g fre@ people whÂ§fÂ§ eaeh haÂ§ a

PERSONAL MENTION.
It might be imagined by an unlnstr'uct
ed person that those were fantastic dolls;
but the fact Is that they ure votivo offer
ings made by the Nlcobar savages to
ward off disease and bad luck. For this
purpose they are kept in the houses, and
Archipelago. They are carved
out of wood, arc from three to' six feet
high and quite unlike anything In tho
way of Images that was ever seen hero
before. All are elaborately painted; some
represent strango birds, and one very
largo effigy scorns to bo a mermaid. ' â¢
A WHOLE nock of winged angels
has descended upon tho National
Museum at Washington, being
newly arrived from tho Nlcobar
The Nicobarese are extremely Imita
tive, and the Images they make, when
not counterfeiting birds or other animals,
fcro likely to be Intended for likenesses
of people who visit the islands from
rfar. Many trading vessels stop at tho
of the efflgy from harm,
It seems that If a gentleman of Nlco
bar is seriously 111 the most Important
measure he adopts with a view to rocov
ory la to make an Imago of some sort.
Tho object to bo represented Is chosen
almost at random, apparently. It may
be a chicken, or a man, or a lizard, but
it must be of considerable size. Once
finished it affords a tenement for a spirit,
whoso business it is to defend the owner
U In not uncommon to see three or four
auch lmngcs nankins from the celllnir of
a native hut, protecting the Inmates from
ell sort* of mlHhnp*.
Hitherto very little hns been known
cbout the Nlcobar Inland*,' which are In
tho bay of Bengal* but Dr. W. L. Ab
bott, the famous explorer, vUltcd them
lecontly nnd made an exhaustive Â¦?.udy
of tho people. It wbb he who acnt to
WttBhlngton tho "angels" nnd other quc*-r
cfflfflcH rcferrtd to, nnd with them he
forwarded n most Interesting account of
their meaning and of the sources from
f whlch the aboriginal sculptors derive
their inspiration.

yesterday when the sun went down. The

The gasoline schooner Ida A, whose
non-arrival at Bolinas caused some anx
iety, has turned up all right. She was
unable to make a landing at the Faral
lones on Saturday, and on-her way back
to port was caught in the storm. She ran
to Drakes Bay for shelter, and with two
anchors out rode safely through the gale.
She landed supplies at the Farallones on
Monday and then proceeded to Bolinas.
Ida A Was in Drakes Bay.
A telegram from Seattle states that the
steamship Czarina reached there yester
day afternoon from San Francisco after
having passed through a hurricane be
tween the mouth of the Columbia River
and Tatoosh light. She reports that the
disabled schooner Northwest was picked
vp last Thursday by the steam schooner
Brunswick and was in tow of the Bruns
wick to this city. The Czarina passed the
steam Fchooner and her tow on Friday,
about twenty miles southeast of Point
Arena. The Northwest had run out of
previsions and rescue ships had been sent
to her assistance.

The Marine Exchange, a bureau of ship
ping information recently organized for
the benefit of boatmen and hotel run
ners, is giving Its patrons lots of exercise
of the wild-goose-chase-phantom-ship or
der these days. As a disturbing element
the new bureau has made its impression
I several times. The steamship San Jose,
1 which arrived yesterday morning, was
the vehicle fcr. a- series of impressions.
The Marine Exchange observer received
a Marconi from dreamland on Sunday
evening which read, "San Jose ten miles.
The message was forwarded to the ex
change headquarters and the Sabbath
stillness of Brannan street soon gave
place to the rattle of hotel buses ana ex
press wagons. The night watchman at
the Mail dock was startled by the noise,
and as he opened the wicket door to in
vestigate was greeted by a chorus of
"Mush House!" "Mush House! "Bag
gage!" "Check your baggage!" ' Hack,
S "What's the matter with you fellows?
Crazy 7" he demanded.
"San Jose coming in. Marine Exchange
just reported it."
Hacks, hotel buses and express wagons
went away hack and rested until Monday
afternoon, when the Marine Exchange
observer at Mount Tarr.alpais saw In the
(smoke of the transpoit Meade another
opportunity to exercise the hotel and ex
press horses and to rehearse the board
bed-and-baggage chorus. He again re
ported thrSan Jose.
"When the San Jose really did arrive the
Marine Exchange observer wasi taking a
well earned rest.

Three dead sailors were taken to the
2.1orgue yesterday. One was asphyxiated
fcy illuminating gas and two were the
victims of accidents on shipboard.
The first case was that of E. Anderson,
a native of Sweden, 25 years old. He ar
rived at his lodgings, 248 East street, from
the theater at 12:15 o'clock yesterday
morning, and at 8:30 was found dead In
bed. with the gas turned fully on.
Joseph Le Juen, 13 years old, a member
of the crew of the French bark Marie
Molinos. lying at the drydock, was on
board the vessel working the capstan,
when his foot slipped and he was thrown
over the bow of the bark to .the drydock.
forty feet below. He struck on his head
and was instantly killed.
Francois Emile, chief officer of the
French bark Max. was killed yesterday
Â¦afternoon. He was working at the lower
masthead when the lines supporting the
mizzen topmast parted and the topmast
came down, catching Emile and throwing
him to the deck, fifty feet below. Emile

was killed instantly.

Â£sÂ«rj*aHE Pacific Mall steamship San
I Jose arrived yesterday from Pan
11 ama and way ports, two days be-
II yond schedule time. The delay
was caused partly by bad weath
er, but largely through the foul condition
of the vessel's hull, which held her down
to a slow rate of speed. The San Jose en
countered a heavy storm on Friday night,
shipping some big seas, but sustaining no
damage. She brought a number of pas
sengers, the only one of any particular
note being Rene Clavius Marius, Chief
Justice of Tahiti. Judge Marius is re-
I turning to Papeete after a visit to friends
In Panama. The steamship brought a
large cargo, which included treasure val
ued at $129,000. "
The cabin passengers were Mrs. F. G.

Clavius Marius, T. Drownlie, R. C. Sur

As the Ri3 Â«3e Janeiro struck on Fort
Point Keck it would have b?en impossible
for her to havÂ«: sunk and drifted out to
sea to find a resting place near the Far
allor,es. Seafaring men cling to the the
ory that the wrecJt of the Rio de Janeiio
is lying fathoms, deep in the Golden Gate
otf Point Diablo* about a mile from the
EPQt where she ran on the rocks. -Pala
dini is proud ot the wreckage brought by
his man, though the damage to his nets
CSBXmted v> more thnn $300.
O. Canopa. the chief fisherman of the
Henrietta, and A. Shiappacass, the cap
tain of the vessel, stated yesterday that
They CUZ ret think the wreckage belonged
to the Rio de Janeiro.
The Henrietta on Monday, while Oft the
3'arallones and at a point about twenty
miles from the* Cliff House, raised her
nets from a depth of 300 feet of water.
The steam windlass had considerable dlf
rieulty in bringing up the nets, and the
men on the vessel were not surprised to
sre a mass of twisted iron come to the
surface. One buge piece of Iron work,
<>Ftimated 10 wcign about two tons, broke
â¢through the nets and sank to the bottom
of the ocean. An iron brace, twelve fett
long, was, howtver, secured by the flsh
trmen and brought to land. It was In
spected by many people yesterday at Pa
ladini's market. The brace evidently be
longed to a v.ooden ship, for it has copper
bolts ranging from twelve to eighteen
inches in length. From the shape of the
!>race, shipping men believe that it was
the bow of a vessel. The iron work is
eaten deep with rust and the copper bolts
thickly coated with verdegris from the
action of the salt water. Barnacles and
suckers were clustered on the iron that
told a silent story of a tragedy of the
oc.nn. As to the vessel it belonged to it
is impossible to say. The iron had evident
ly been subjected to the action of the
Â¦water for many years, and estimates
â¢were made that it had been buried be
rvuth the ocean for a period ranging
from thirty to iitty years. Â«.
The report, however, had no founda
tion, and the resting place of the Rio de
Janeiro Ftlll remains unknown.
There was considerable excitement on
the water front yesterday when it was
repoÂ«-t.Â»d that wreckage from the ill-fated
â¢steamship Rio de Janeiro had been
brought to the Burface on Monday by the
nets of the 6tcam fishing boat Henrietta,

ONLY A SUGGESfioij
But It Has Provfji of Interest and
Valas to Thousands.
Common tense would suggest that if one
vMn to bseome flpsliy and plump it can only
result from the food Â« eat and digest, and
that food should b? "albuminous or flesh-form-
ir.tr food. l!k<? eggs, beefsteak and cereals; 1n
other Â¦words, the kind? of food that make flesh
are the food* which form the greater part of
*;ur <3aily bills of fare.
/""-Â¦ "11T j . . ~*> -3^
But the trouble is that while we eat enough,
and generally too much, the stomach, from
abuse ar.O overwork, docs not properly digest
and assimilate it. which is the reason so man;
people remain thin and under weight: the' di-
Etttive organs do noi completely digest the
ilesh-forming beefsteak and eggs and similar
Â¦wholesome food.
There are thousands of 6uch who are reallj
confirmed dyspeptics, although they may havÂ«
r.o particular pain or inconvenience from theii
stomachs.
I- ruch persons would lay their prejudices
aside and meUc a regular practice of taking,
after each meal, one or two of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets the tood would be quickly and
thorouRhiy digested, because these tablets con-
tain the natural peptones and diastase which
every weak Ktomach lacks, and by supplying
this want the stomach is soon enabled to re-
gain its natural tone and vigor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest every form
f.f flesh-forming food. meat, eggs, bread and
potatoes, and this is the reason they so quickly
build up. strengthen and invigorate thin, dys-
peptic men. women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most delicate,
t:Fe th*-m with marked benefit, as they contain
no Etronp, irritating drugs, no cathartic not
ar.y harmful ingredient
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the most euc-
epssful and most widely known of any remedy
for stomach troubles because it is the most rea-
sonable and scientific of modern medicines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet* are sold by every
GrtiKglet in the United states and Canada, aÂ«
well as in Great Britain, at 50 cents for com-
plete treatment.
Nothing further is required to cure any
Etomach trouble or to make thin, nervous, dys-
peptic people strong, plump and well.

.NEW* YORK. March 4. â To-dav> stock'mar
ket for the greater part of the 'day repeatrd
the retracing of yesterday's upward course in
the regular process of taking profits on a sniail
turn, which Is a characteristic of the. narrow
professional market. Late In the day, how
ever. ' the selling movement gained appreciable
force and cSrried prices downward by rapid
t-tages to the lowest of the day, making, the
closing active and v/eaU. The maiket also
broadened out considerably in the late selling
movement and the dealings were much better
distributed than at any othÂ«r time during the
day. The standard stocks were as greatly af
lectÂ»Â«<i as some of the minor specialties which
have been lately conspicuous in the marKet.
The growing dimensions of the requirements
upon New York cash reserves seemed to be tne
cause of the rather acute uneasiness manifeKt
ed. The engagement of gold for export an
nounced to-day lor Thursday's and Saturday's
fcteamers and others likely to be made indi
cate the probability of an outgo of Â»;>.O00,CO0
or over this week to foreign .shores. The un
derwriting syndicate of the San Francisco trac
tion reorganization railed on Its subscribers
to-day !or a 20 per cent payment 1 on Thursday.
This means the remittance to San Francisco
at that time of about $4,000,000. It Is true that
this operation will mean no encroachment upon
the country's available money supply, as the
Treasury authorities will pay in San Francisco
Immediately. the amount deposited in the Sub-
Tre.asurV In New York, but the operation In
volves a depletion of New York bank reserves,
nevertheless. The Sub-Treasury had already
taken trom the New York money market since
Friday on routine operations $3,111,000.
With the surplus reserves of the banks last
week below ?10,()00.000, these figures Indicate
sufficient requirements to wipe out the surplus
entirely. The confidence which has 'been felt
in the continued ease of the money market was
partly based on the belief that the Government
bonds would be offered to the frade for redemp
tion in case of any real need In the New. York
money market. As a matter of fact bonds to
the par value of a million dollars were offered
to the - Sub-Treasury late to-day, for which
$1,122,401 was paid In cash, but this, did, not
seem to relieve the apprehension of a possible
money squeeze. . It was noticeable also that the
Eterllng exchange market was affected by the
offerings of, bills against the gold engaged for
export, bo that rates yielded a fraction which
was not the case when gold was engaged last
week. The statement of - the Missouri Pacific
for January, showing a decrease in net earnings
of $521,000, caused an early sharp decline In
that stock and affected the list, offsetting the
Influence of other favorable ; railroad : reports,
notably the extraordinary showing mode by
the annual report of Pennsylvania.
The bond- market was inclined to dullness,
but held comparatively steady. Total sales

CHICAGO, March 4. â Opening conditions In
wheat were .bearish, but sentiment ! soon
changed and the later tone was bullish.
Traders were fearful to sell short during the
present uncertain state of the winter-crop.
CcmnilEEion-houses bought a little and claims
were made that St. Louis and the Southwest
were, buvlni. There was still no moisture In
the Southwest, but weather conditions Â¦ were
favorable otherwise. Corn strength helped
somewhat, but the estreme â¢ dullness Â¦ took the
edge oft' the gradually growing bullish senti
ment. Cables were somewhat lower early, but

and nt the West were very light. May closed

. Oats were dull, though somewhat nervous.
Some May stuff was offered at the opening,
which, with the early corn weakness, caused
a belter feeling. Fluctuations continued- to
follow corn. The market closed fairly . firm,
May lie up at 44%c.

Heavy rains have fallen in all psrts of the
Ftiite Ouring the week, the precipitation hav

H15I1 ccutheast winds have prevailed in the
central and northern sections, causing consid
er? ble damage to orchards, telegraph lines,
bul'dinps and fences, and Interrupting the
Â¦fer.y service on the bay. Rivers and creeks
Jisac overflowed their banks; the rush of water
hnt caused breaking of levees on the Sacra
nwr.to, resulting in many washouts and Imped
ing railroad traffic. The snowfall In th* moun
tains is reported unusually heavy- Enow has
Rlf\> fallen on the lower levels at Red Bluff.
RÂ« -Ifling and other places. The temperature

thi? It has be<=n immeasurably benefited in all
p'vUons by the heavy rainfall. Nearly all re
ports Indicate that wheat and barley are In the
very best condition, and Â«"ven in the heretofore
dry Fouthern district? there is now an excellent
prospect for bountiful crops. The continued
warn weather and rain have cau*Pd a rapid
grronth cf grain, alfalfa and pasturage. Plow
ing and feeding will be resumed in many places
es f=oon *Â«f th? soil becomes tillable, 2nd the
pi-5-in acreage materially increased.
rrcspects continue good for heavy- crops of

<"oast and Bay Sections. â The week has been
marked ly, extremely high winds, warm
â¢wrather and heavy rainfall, precipitation hav
ing occurred r.early every d*>y in Rome section*.
The hifrh v.lnds and floods have caused consid
erable iJamase to both agricultural and com

interrupted, railroad traffic delayed, buildir.es

Tlie actual loss, however. Is probably more
tl'an compensated for by the benefit that will
b" derived by farmery and orchardists. There
If now every Indication that large crops of
(train, hay and fruit' will be gathered in all
factions. Grain and srrasR are growing rap
idly. Dfiduous fruit trees* are In bloom.

GENERAL SUMMARY
The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
Â«i;ector of the climate and crop service of the
"VWather Bureau, Is as follows:
The Weather and Crops.
Mail advices from New York say: "At the
moment a somewhat better Interest has devel
oped In prunes, the aggregate movement being
fairly large. On 40s a little firmness is obsrved.
with most holders asking 6?4c In 25-lb boxes
for Santa Clara fruit. Outside fruit, accord
ing to quality, still offers from 6^c up for 40
50s in 25-lb boxes. There is a better Inquiry
notid from interior distributers, and several
fair-sized lots of assorted sizes have been
moved \rfthin the quoted range. Oregon 30s are
reported in small compass, with 6*ic generally
quoted firm for fruit In 25-lb boxes. Coast ad
vi< cs indicate a fair movement for interior and
export account In both old and new fruit. In
currants the market is quiet and the felling
t-h<.Â»-E easiness within the quoted range for fine
Amalia grade. A moderate jobbing Interest is
noted, with sales chiefly in small lots on the
basis of Sh+c for fine Amalias In barrels. Re
rcrts are current of lower values, but the prin
cipal holders are unchanged. We note the ar
rival fx Rotterdam steamer of 600 barrels, the
tamp being, without appreciable effect at the
momont. The market on the other side Is re
ported somewhat easier. In raisins a fair in
terest is noted in Valencia layers, with 7^*c
Â«4u<^t*d. California seeded are In moderate re
quest and eteady. Loose raisins are somewhat
f.rin. Apricots command ' some attention and
the views of holder* are hardening. Peaches
are firm n.nd there is noted a good jobbing
interest within the quoted range. Pears are
unchanged. In figs there Is noted a good busi
ness In bas stock, with some firmness to re-
I<irt. Layers are held on a steady basis. We
not* the arrival from Rotterdam of 20 cases.
!Jat*>s are meeting a good jobbing demand, with
ou-itations unchanged. In nuts generally
through the list the demand Is more active."

Receipts were 61,600 pounds and 16 tub3 of

California Cheese, pounds of Oregon
Cheese and pounds of Eastern Cheese.
Receipts of Eggs continue large and the sup
ply is still excessive and unwieldy. Dealers
are not making any further concessions to
buyers, however. There will be large lines
put into cold storage just as soon as the
weather gets dry enough to permit It, which
will relieve the market of considerable of- Its
surplus. .Prices for all grades stand about as
before.
Cheese continues In ample supply and the
market Is rather weak than otherwise.
Receipts of Butter were much larger yes
terday, and the general opinion was that the
market had reached the top, though another
week of heavy .storms might again advance
prices by prolonging the scarcity. Quotations
remained unchanged.

.BOSTON, ' March 4.â No weakness in values
is noted in the wool market he're this week;
although the demand continues quiet. The
lack of demand is due to the fact that the
large manufacturers as a rule have enough
wool on hand to meet present needs and have
shown little disposition to buy and the smaller
manufacturers are buying sufficient to fill pres
ent orders only. There is a moderate demand
for territory wools and values hold firm. ;

Purchase of Ballot Paper
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Election Commissioners yesterday re
garding the advisability of appealing from
an adverse decision of the Superior Court
of Sacramento In the suit of the Secretary
of State vs. the city of San Francisco, in
volving the cost of ballot paper. After
quoting the law Lane says:
There la no law requiring the Secretary of
State to call for competitive bids for supplies
which he may have power to order. Accepting
the . law as decided by Judge Hughes there
would remain a question of fact. Did the Secre
tary of State sell the paper to the city and
county at Its cost to him? After careful Inves
tigation I have been unable to obtain any evi
dence that the paper did not cost the Secretary
of State the amount charged, and I know of
no way of proving that he charged more than
the law allows. The remedy. If there is one,
lies with the Legislature.

The Secretary of the Treasury has no
tified Port Collector Stratton that a Chi
nese person who i3 shown to have been
employed as a laborer In this country and
who failed to register either under the
act of May 5. 1S92. or of November 3. l&W.
cannot be admitted as a returning mer
chant upon evidence that subsequent to
such failure to so register he became a
bona nde merchant. The opinion wa3

Receipts of Los Angeles Vegetables were
large . yesterday, something unusual for Tues
day. .- The .bulk of the receipts were In poor
condition owing: to the rain In the south, and
most kinds were lower. Choice Peas and Beans
sold. well at full figures, but there waa a large
amount sold even below the quotations. Re
ceipts of. Asparigus were 61 boxes and prices
were about the Â¦ same. . Rhubarb was weaker
under .larger receipts. Four sacks of Peaa
came in from Alameda County and sold at 6@7c
per lb. The Panama steamer brought up 222
cases of Tomatoes and Peppers.
The weak feeling in Onions continues. This
may bo accounted for to some extent by the
poor- quality of most of the stock on Rand.
Except for a small inquiry for strictly fancy
offerings,' the demand Is limited. Green Onions
are .coming in more freely and sell readily at
the quotations.
.The Potato market was quiet under liberal
supplies and prices remained unchanged. The
steamer Area ta from Coos Bay brought down
2550 sacks and", few sales were made on, the
Â¦wharf. Dealers expect- a. firmer market this
week, as receipts per steamer due Thursday aro
expected to be light. Early Rose are very
scarce and In demand for seed. Other Seed Po
tatoes are slow at present, but will, pick up
if . the clear weather lasts.

Friends of the Nicaragua route in the
Senate, who have been made acquainted
with the substance of this report. Insist
that it is a finishing: blow for the Panama
project and predict that it will hasten,
action in favor of the Nicaragua route by
the full committee and greatly assist the
passage of the bill in the Senate.
In Senator Foster's report, which will bo
submitted to the full committee no late*
than next Monday several new points
are made against the Panama route and
it is said by Senators familiar with the
canal situation that it will be impossible
to controvert them either in committee or
on the floor of tho Senate. This report
has been Bgreed to by Senators Morgan,
Mitchell, Foster and Turner. Senator
Prltchard was not present and Senator
Kittridge will make the minority report.
The Bub-committee finds that it will bo
impossible for this Government to pur*
chase the Panama Railroad, owned by
the Paftama Canal Company, except by
an act of Congress, and in addition the
consent of the New York Legislature.
Btlll further an act of the Colombian
Congress will be necessary to govern the
use and disposal of its concessions to the
Panama Company by this Government.
After this it will also become necessary
to deal with the Colombian Government
by treaty. v
A new and important objection to thÂ»
Panama project is found by the eub-cora
mittee in the law enacted in France,
June IS, 1SSS, by which it is made incum
bent on the Panama Canal Company to
use in construction only tho machinery
made in France. It is further provided
by this law that all of the material used
In the work on the canal shall be of
French origin. This law still stands and
provides for a substantial monopoly which
France is not likely to give up in. a hurry.
Before our Government could purchase
the Panama concessions the repeal of this
law would first be necessary.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.
TV., WASHINGTON. March 4.â Sentiment
in favor of the construction of an isth.
mian canal by the Nicaragua route has
received new and substantial support in
ihe recommendation of the Eub-comraittee
of the Committee on Interoceanic Canals
against the purchase of the Panama con
cessions. This sub-committee has agreed
en points of Its report to the full com
mittee and Senator Foster Is now engaged
in drawing It up in proper form.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Drs. Compton and W. W. Johnston had
a consultation to-day and said later that
they hoped for recovery.
Belmont first began to suffer from in
fluenza a week ago yesterday. Symptoms
of pneumonia and disturbances of the
stomach soon appeared. His condition
was not at first regarded as serious, but
he grew worse.
WASHINGTON. March 4.â It was stated
to-night that O. H. P. Belmonfs condi
tion was serious. Mrs. Belmont. who
came from the South on a special train
last night, has been at her husband's bed
side all day. The crisis in the disease,
which is pneumonia, has not yet been
reached and until that comes Belmonfs
friends say that it is not safe to call him
entirely put of danger. Â¦ .
'Â¦Mr. Belmont passed a good night last
night," said- Dr. William Penn Compton,
bis physician. "The condition of his
stomach is so much improved that ha is
now able to retain nourishment. Com
plications resulting from disturbances of
the stomach have all along given rise to
greater uneasiness than the pneumonia
symptoms."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Principal Martin would not reply to the
charges to-day. He said he would reserve
his defense for the investigation, if there
is one.
Mrs. Henderson says that she informed
Principal Martin not to administer any
corporal punishment to her child, and
that he has bo far obeyed her wishes.
Mrs. Baumann complains that he slappeu
her daughter Clara when there was no
need for it. â. '
. There is a rule of the department that
forbids corporal punishment except in
extreme cases, but the parents "htnk the
principal has considered that corporal
punishment fits all cases.
"I sent six children to the Piedmont
School, and I never had any trouble until
Principal Martin came. I objected to him
because of the way he whipped my boy.
I went to him about it once and he v>ns
very discourteous in hl3 treatment of mr.
When I told him I would see the Schoo!
Superintendent, he said: 'Very well,
madam,, you can go right out the fronr
door and take the first car.' That is
what we've had to contend with rigr.t
along 1 . I aend my boy to a private school
now."
Mrs. Frank Katzenberg of Linda avenua
says that she was forced to take her child
from school at the beginning of this
term because of tho conduct of the prin
cipal. . Mrs. Katzenberg said:
"Willie Tullet, who was expelled by ttu?
principal, says that before he was f orceil
to quit the school Martin beat him black
and blue with a bat. The boy is twelve
years old.
"He fired me for teasing the girls," said
Willie to-day. "Before that he beat m;
with a stick while the janitor held me. He
said I threw orange peels around the
yard, but I didn't."

Following the charges made by E. o.
Thompson \n a communication that was
read before the Board of Kducation last
night against Irvin D. Martin, principal
of the Piedmont School, complaints are
coming from other parents whose childrea
have been subjected to flogging at the
hands of the principal. The people 'of th*
district have generally felt that Principal
Martin has not been judicious fa the
chastisement of the ""children that have
been confided to his care and that he is
unduly anxious to use hi3 rod and frowns.

have only about .thirty years of future
life, in his opinion, which means a future
yield of not much more than $3,000,000. In
eight or ten years after peace the ; Rand

discovery in 1885 the Rand has yielded
$400,0Â«0,000 In gold. Just before the war

pany has opened a vein of ore on the Cal
averas River near the marble belt. The
Mead Company is Binking its shaft.
The Tuqlumne Independent reports that
the Stockton gravel mine at Jupiter has
resumed work. The Jamestown Mining
and Milling Company has transferred to
Charles H. Treat of Lbs Angeles a bond
on the Badger mine. The property is six
miles east from Jamestown. The bond
also includes the Calker and Annie Dwyer
quartz mine. The John Royal mine, two
miles east from Columbia, has been bond
ed to Eugene C. Day and others. The
Eureka quartz mine, west of the Confi
dence mill site, has been sold to the Con
fidence Mining and Milling Company. A
nugget weighing more than 136 ounces and
valued at|2300 'is reported to have been
found at woodbury's hydraulic mine near
Yankee Hill.
Manager Brown of the Trinity Copper
Company denies that there is an intention
to construct a joint smelter at Kennet.
Notes in Field.
It is very much nearer to the mines than
any of the Atlantic coast eities. and with the
completion of an interoceanlc canal it will be
equally near to all of the consuming markets
of commodities. The canal will restore nat
ural lines of movement to the assembling vt
raw materials an4 the distribution of com
modities manufactured from them. The one
will co outward to the nearest seacoast as
sembling point, the other Inland from thÂ«
nearest coast port. Ban Francisco, on the Pa
cific coast, will, just as has New York on the
Atlantic coast, become the principal point tÂ£
assembling and distribution.
San Francisco Bay and its extensions, San
Pablo and Suisun bays, provide on their shore
lines probably a greater linear extent of deep
water eea frontage, and back door railroad
facilities already created, than any seaport
in the world. The shore stretch from Oakland
to about Antloch may all be regarded as im
mediately available. It Is all bordered by a
channel of deep water, nowhere requiring very
long piers to reach it from the shore! Two
lines of transcontinental railroads run along
it, so that rail and ehlp are close together.
The facilities for the cheap assembling of
cheap fuel ere already partially completed and
their practicability proven. The petroleum
carryiug pipe line from the San Joaquin Valley
will give this district the cheapest fuel supply
of any great seaport city in the world.
Great industrial changes have heretofore ac
complished themselves on the Atlantic coast
without making similar changes on the Pacltlq
Coast. The shifting of the centers, of metal
lurgical Industry from inland to ecu port cities,
the great industrial movement going en in
the present time at the Kast is, unlike pre
ceding changes, making a "similar change here.
To realize this it is only necessary to com
pare the industrial establishments existing and
projected on this line of bay shore three years
ago with those existing and projected now.
The increase is all out of proportion to the
gains of equal but preceding periods of time.
The ultimate development here indicated is in
evitable. It is coming rapidly.' The founda
tion for it has been prepared in the assem-:
bling at one 'point of the conditions which su
united make a commercial foundation for a
great center of metallurgical industry.
"The position of San Francisco," says
the Mining and Scientific Press, "as an
assembling point for the raw materials
of a metallurgical industry leaves noth
ing to be desired." Continuing the Press
says: â¢ " ;
An Assembling Point.
Among the signs of the times is the
growing Importance of San Francisco' a
relations to the mineral Industrie* of the
Pacific Coast. Once this city was the
great supply point for the placer mines.
Time has brought many changes in min
ing. Many believe that this city will be
come a great metallurgical center. What
has happened at New York, it Is argued,
may well be repeated at San Francisco,
the general conditions not being dissim
ilar. This topic is ably discussed from
several points of view by the Mining and
Scientific Press, -which calls attention to
the fact that north of San Francisco and
Oakland are ideal sites on both shores o?
Carquinez Straits and on the entire south
shore of San Pablo and Suisun bays for
metallurgical plants. The aggregate or
frontage is not far from one hundred
miles. At tirst it was thought that metal
lurgical.! plants properly belong close to
the mines, but the cheapness and facil
ities for> assembling raw materials and
distributing finished commodities are su
perior at seaport cities.

in the case of William Buckley, convicted
of murder in the first degree, was con
tinued till Saturday.
P ttornoy Peter F. Dunne replied for tha
prosecution, arguing that the defendant
had been granted a just and fair trial.
Judge Liiwlor took the matter under ad
visement till Friday morning.
Attorney George D. Collins, on behalf
of the defendant, argued that a new trial
should be granted on the grounds that
the Judge erred in admitting evidence
against the objections of the defendant;
that the prosecution was guilty pf mis
conduct in the addresses to the jury and
that the court erred in not giving sixteen
instructions to the jury asked for by the
defc-ndant. - .
Arguments on the motion for a new trial
in the case of Thomas Moran, convicted
on a charge of murdering George W.
Rice, a non-union machinist, at Twentieth
and Howard streets. October 11, were
heard yesterday by Judge Lawlor.
Judge Lawlor Reserves His Decision
in the Matter Until Next
Friday. . .
Then the terms came in for scathing
review from half a dozen speakers. There
were no personalities indulged in, but
each speaker who declared against a sur
render of all that the union has advocated
for so many long months was cheered to
the echo. Finally a motion to postpone
action until to-night was put and car
ried by acclamation. Previous to this one
speaker bitterly denounced the proposal
to railroad this measure through the
meeting without giving the members time
to reflect on and fully grasp its terms.
Outside the hall after the meeting al
most every one of the 1500 machinists
present had bitter remarks for the condi
tions submitted and the man bearing
them. The usual charges of betrayal and
treachery were made and the situation,
as far as a settlement was concerned, did
not seem nearly as hopeful as before the
meeting was called.
The greatest secrecy was maintained by
the members and officers of the organiza
tion regarding the terms of settlement
proposed and it was stated before the
meeting that nothing would be given out
for publication, even if a vote was
reneh<vi, until the result had been in
dorsed I by the national headquarters at
Washi|?ton.
The iT.eeting was held In the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club's rooms on Sixth
street.
MOBAN ASKS FOR A NEW
TRIAL ON MURDER CHARGE
Scathing Speeches Made.
No sooner had Macarthur finished than
there were half a hundred men on their
feet, protesting against the acceptance of
any such terms, was with
difficulty, and a feeble attempt was made
by the few present who favored a re
turn to 'work to bring the question to an
immediate vote. This was voted down
almost unanimously.
If, on the other hand the National
Board shall determine that ten hours'
work a day is reasonable the unions are
to abide by the result. In either case
the employers shall not be compelled to
discharge any non-union men they may
have in their employ previous to the ac
ceptance of these terms by the strikers.
Macarthur epoke nearly three hours,
and his address was listened to in silence.
Many of the members withdrew when its
purport became disclosed, and it was tha
universal sentiment of these that the
terms should not be accepted. His propo
sition, briefly put, was that the striking
machinists return to work on the ten
hour basis, and leave the settlement en
tirely in the hands of National Board
of Arbitration. If this body shall decide
in its report to be Issued next June, that
the machinists are entitled to work only
nine hours a day, then the union shall
again call out its men from such estab
lishments as refuse to abide by this de
cision.
Terms Are Not Satisfactory.
To their Intense Furprise tne proposition
submitted by Macarthur was a virtual
surrender of all the main points of con
tention and every speaker following him
denounced it in unmeasured terms.

of hearing the report of Walter Mac

It is the intention of those Interested in
the project to make many improvements
In the railroad service along its lines.
While the most important proposition in
connection with the new deal is that it
gives the Santa Fe an advent into Oak
land, other plans will be put into effect
which will give the neighboring, towns a
quick, efficient railroad and ferry system
to San . Francisco and Oakland. The
Santa Fe Company has already ordered
several large ferry-boats for the new
service,' which, it is claimed, will prove
faster' and better equipped Â¦ than the
Southern Pacific boats.
The Santa Fe people have been trying
to acquire the property for several years.
There were many obstacles in the way.
The affairs of the road were in a chaotic
state. It was harassed by all sorts of
litigation. Contracts it had with land
owners along its line for right of way had
expired and in some cases the land own
ers were left unpaid, and before the new
company could induce the Santa Fe to get
behind the proposition new contracts for
right of way had to be made and several
old debts settled.
Entirely New Ferry ' System.
The articles of incorporation name M.
J. Keller,. F. C. Havens, M. A. de
Laveaga, A. E. Bolton and G. E. Pratt
as directors and each claims an owner
ship of SSOOO worth of stock in the new
company. The company's capital stock is
set at $1,000,000. Tne old narrow gauge
road will be supplanted by broad gauge
tracks just as soon as the company is
given a broad gauge franchise. This will
probably be applied for Immediately and
no doubt will be granted. It is said that
the various officials who have it in their
power to grant the new company tho
franchise to operate a broad gauge road
over its newly acquired property have
already agreed to do so and operations
will probably commence within the next
few months. The first extension will be
built to San Pablo to connect with , the
Santa Fe. Another track will be laid to
Walnut Creek and the road will be com
pleted to the terminus contemplated by
Captain Smith before his death.
The California and Nevada road is
owned by the Realty Syndicate and the
Grant Bros, of Oakland, and they are
heavily interested in the new company.
It is understood that no opposition to
the granting of the franchise for a broad
gauge road will be made by the people
of Oakland, for the reason that the bulk
of the citizens across the bay are highly
in favor of making their town the ter
minus of the Santa Fe road.
No Opposition to Franchise.
' The first step toward getting the Santa
Fe Into Oakland way taken yesterday,
when the Oakland and East Side Kailroad
Company Hied articles of Incorporation
with the County Clerk. The new com
pany has settlcu the litigation, which has
harassed the California and Nevada Rull
road Company eince the death of it*
founder, captain Smith, some years ago.
It haa secured the ownership of the prop
erty and in turn has consummated a deal
with tho Santa *'e whereby the latter
company will absorb the California and
Nevada and tho new. Oakland and East
Side Company. The only obstacle in the
way of tho new project Is the securing
of a broad gauge franchise, as the little
road is a narrow gauge concern and can
not operate a broad gauge road.
As predicted ,by The Call more than a
year ago, the city of Oakland will soon
become a terminus for another transcon
tinental railroad. A deal was made early
this week whereby the Santa Fe road has
practically secured the right ot way Into
the very heart of Oakland. It only re
mains for the officiate of the Santa Fe to
secure a broad gauge franchise for ths
California and Nevada Railroad, operat
ing between Emeryville and Bryant, Con

Stormy Meeting of Strikers, Where Proposition Is Denounced

for, and Definite Action on It Is Postponed Until To-Night
BURGLARS MAKE
A DARING RAID
Home of John Bergez on
Clay Street Is Thor-
oughiy Looted.
Valuable Plunder Is Secured
and Damage Done to
Furnishings.
While John Bergez. the proprietor of
the Bergez restaurant on Pine street, and
his family were absent for a short time
last night from their residence at 1428
Clay street, burglars entered the house
and ransacked three of the rooms. They
eecured a magnificent sealskin cape,
valued at &09. belonging to Mrs. Bergez.
They were frightened away by the unex
pected return of Mrs. Bergez or their
plunder would have been still richer. They
had not yet located the family Jewels or
silverware, but they were making a very
thorough search.
The burglars carried on their work bold
ly and with nuch an air of security an to
leave little doubt that they are experi
enced hands at pillaging houHes. They
waited until every iticmbcr of the family
had left the house and then entered, it Is
supposed, through the front door. They
dla not try to conceal their presence In
the house, but proceeded to light the gas
in 1hrâ¢Â» of the upper front rooms. In
*rs retting for valuables they tore up car
jvts, ripped open mattresses and Btrewcd
the pillows and bed coverings about the
rooms. â¢ . â¢'
When Mrs. Bergez reached her home
and noticed the lights burning brightly
In the upper portion of the house she
thought all was not right, so she sent her
little bey to find Special Officer Mackey,
who was on duty in the nelghboihood.
Before the arrival of the officer the
burglars became alarmed and escaped. It
is supposed that one of them was on the
lookout and saw Mrs. Bergez returning.
How the burglars managed to get away
from the premises is not known. They
could not have passed through the front
yard without being eeen by Mrs. Bergez
and they could not have gone through the
vard In the rear of the house without
being attacked by the watchdog. The
only manner of escape left for them was
to climb over the fence at the side of the
house and pass through the neighboring
yards. This theory substantiates the be
lief that is entertained by the police that
the burglars are the same who have com
mitted various other robberies in the vi
cinity of the Eerfrez residence.
On Monday night a house on Hyde
6treet near Clay was plundered by burg
lars whose method of procedure was simi
lar to that of those who entered the
Bergez home. In both Instances the
thieves waited until the inmates of the
house had cone out before commencing
their 'Tvork. and In both cases mattresses
and carpets were torn up. Two suspicious
looking men have been seen recently loi
tering about the part of the city where
the burglaries were committed. The po
lice have secured 'good descriptions of
the men and expect to arrest tlrem within
e day or two.

The islands threatened With inundation
are situated in the Sacramento River be
tween Antioch and Jtio -Vista.' They have
been- reclaimed from the waters of the
river by the construction of substantial
levees,' many yards in thickness. The
lands thus fortified against the water
have proved exceedingly Â¦ fertile and pro-:
duce asparagus that lias become famous.
Should the levee be cut and the islands be
come inundated more than' $2(W,0:0 worth
of property would be destroyed. On last
Saturday Ryer Island was submerged and
its entire crop of asparagus and a"}l . the
buildings and fixtures on the island" com
pletely destroyed. - â¢ ' . 'â¢ 'Â¦'',
As soon as the Injunction was secured
Attorney Countryman -.telephoned to the
Sheriff of Sacramento County, requesting
him to proceed at once to the levee. : A
number of men were sent tq the islands
last night frpm this city to reinforce tho
Sheriff. * , Â¦ ;' - ' ....."Â¦-. -, .
The writ was secured by Attorney
Countryman # in behalf of the Voorman
Company, the owner of Tyler and Bouidin
islands, which lie adjacent to Andros Isl
and. If the levee is- cut, the water from
the Sacramento River will flow into Geor
giana Slough and the Mokelumne,.- caus
ing these streams to overflow their, banks
and submerge Tyler and Bouidin Islands.
The writ was. made returnable on March

A temporary injunction was issued j\es
terday afternoon by Judge Carroll Cook
restraining C. H. Oardner, Philip Gard
ner and Hans Wolf from cutting the levee
on the west side of Andros Island, an ex
tensive piece of reclaimed land in . {he
Sacramento River, which was pirtly sub.
merged by the recent freshet. The owners
of the island desired to cut the levee on
the west side in order to permit the
waters, which had inundated the island at
the breaking of the levee on the east side,
to flow into Georgiana Slough and the
Mokelumne River. ....'". .

EIGHT OF WAY SUIT
DISMISSED IN COURT
Officer Plncovic and the drug clerk
came to the rescue, and the horse, bleed
ing and plastered with diluted pavement,
penitently followed to the stable. â¢
A ycung lady happened into the store
to telephone just before the trouble. The
telephone is situated right back of the
pyramid of infallible tonic. She had ju3t
left the phone and crossed the store to
ask the clerk something when the crash
came and she escaped injury by a hair's
breadth.
After shattering the window of Hen
covic's pharmacy the horse for a mo
ment seemed to come to its senses, but
when the fumes of 200 bottles of some
body's infallible tonic and sixty-five bot
tles of some other body's hair Jnvigora
tor, together with large quantities of ex
posed cod liver oil rose to its nostrils the
quadruped snorted. Even a blind horse
will turn. This one had been used to the
perfume of flowers. It reared and tore
round and round In a circle, catching up
a wheelbarrow of burning asphalt in its
wake, which it finally spilled on the
ground and lay down in.
A horse kicked up a series of monkey
shines yesterday afternoon about 3 o'clock
on tho corner of Stelner and Eddy streets
which made a hit with tho small boys of
the neighborhood and incidentally with a
'glass window. It was a sort of one-ring
circus, and the horse demonstrated how
much damage an equinf . though blind, as
this one was, can do in a short time. It
broke the plate glass window of a drug
store, wallowed in the patent medicines,
upset ths burning asphalt of the street
repairer and ended by lying down in it
as if trying to make of itself a burnt of
fering for its sins.
The horse belongs to G. Rossi, florist at
tZl\i Grant avenue. Mr. Rossi lives on
Steiner street, and while he went into his
house for his coat he left the beast stand
ing. He declares that the horse has al
ways been well behaved and is surprised
at its giddy actions in its old age. lie
says that some one must have fright
ened it.
