The railroad company claims that yes

100 applicants. v Of these few would havÂ«
been accepted, however, as they appeared
to be young men from the small towns
in the . country, .unused to city life and
attracted to San Francisco by the pros
pects of going to work as conductors. At
the offices of the railway company there
are s'gns hung conspicuously on the walls,
drawing the attention of applicants to tha
rules for those who wish to enter the ser
vice of the road. The first step taken is
to -ill out an application blank. A medi
cal examination must be undergone and
if passed by the company's doctor the ap
plicant must deposit $35 as a guarantee
of the faithful performance of his duties.
The sum of Â£5 Is also demanded for tnÂ»
purchase of a uniform and to pay a pre

was devoted to a general exchange of
opinions on the merits of the two bills.
The representatives of the Senate pressed
very hard for the acceptance of the Sen

the indications now are that the "Senate

"On the contrary, the -enforcement of

avowed in the treaty of 1894. Despite the
ingenious argument to. the contrary, we
do not perceive any difficulty . whatever

WITNESS OF "WATER CUBE."
WASHINGTON. April 21.â The Senate
Committee on the Philippines to-day re
sumed thc examination of witnesses In
The investigation of affairs in the Phil
ip pines.
Grovcr Flint of Cambridge, Mass., who
served as first lieutenant in the Thirty
fifth Volunteer Infantry, testified that
early in May, 1900, he had been a witness
to the "water cure," as administered to
the natives by Macabebe scouts, and that
this v.as done to get information as to the
Â¦whereabouts of their guns. The guns
were delivered. The following day some
rccn of his own regiment applied the cur?,
but their act was without the authority
of their commanding officers. The Maca
bebes at the time referred to were not
under the command of a commissioned
c!Fcer. but of a sergeant of the United
States army. Flint had been, he said, a
witness to at least twenty cases of wa
ter cure. He had never seen any one die
as a result of the cure, but had seen a
hospital corps man working on a native
who had been rendered unconscious.' It
also had been represented to him that
ccp Filipino died from the cltccts ef the
water cure.
CSUELTY TO OLD MEN.
The witness then described the method
of administering the cure, and said that
in some cases where It was given to old
zren he" had seen their teeth fall out.
Flint, in response to a question by Sen
ator Dietrich, said he was present upon
these occasions, "to draw the line on ex
cesses." He did not recommend to the
rr.a jor that the practice cease, nor did
he give any orders to his men to stop
the torture.
Answering a question by Senator Bur
rows, the witness declared that the effect
of the cure was Immediate, the victim
invariably turning over his gun or bolo
and giving information as to thc where
abouts of others. He said it was impos
sible to judge whether the victims were
Insurgent: soldiers or peasants, but they
appeared to be peaceable villagers. Some
of them were thrown down by force;
others who were timid would submit
readily, while those who resisted were
held the more tightly. The treatment, he
said, never got to a point of great bru
tality.
KAJOB, DID NOT INTERFERE.
Replying to a question by Senator
Lodge, the witness said he had becn re*
fused a commission In the regular army
because his colonel had accused him of
using Intoxicating liquors to excess. The
witness deplored the raising of this ques
tion, but Senator BeverldgÂ© said it had
an important bearing on the case.
Flint denied that on any of the occa
sions when he had witnessed the watet
cure he was under the influence of liquor.
He Insisted that in justice to himself he
ought to state that he was not drunk,
but had been a careless drinker. Witness
had, he said, released several men who
did not appear to him to be insurgents
Major Earl of his regiment wa* always
near, but had not Interfered in the ad
ministration of the cure, simply assign
ing a commanding officer to see that the
men did not go too far.
After considerable questioning the wit
ness finally admitted that he approved
of the water cure, and responding to a
query toy Senator Beveridge said that it
was not an American invention, but was
as old as the "chronicles of Newgate."
Asked regarding Filipinos in guardhouses,
he said that they were treated exactly. the
same as American prisoners.
LIKE WEYLEB'S TACTICS.
The witness described the burning of
email villages, the idea, be said, being to
drive the women to thc woods or to the
towns and concentrate them.
"Whom did the army borrow- that
from?"
"I knew it in Cuba," answered the wit
ness, "under the authority of ' General
Wcylcr." ;
The committee then went Into executive
session. The committee, in executive ses
sion, refused to call Edward Atkinson of
Pcston as a witness, but directed that. a
eubpena Issue for a number of sergeants
and privates who were witnesses uf the
water cure.
Senator Lodge laid before the commit
tee a report by A. Lester Hazelett, who
was sent to the Philippines by the W. C.
T. U.. of Columbus, Wis., to Investigate
the moral conditions existing in the Phil-
Ilppines, and alfo alleged violation of thc
anti-canteen law. The report shows that
the moral condition in the Philippines is :
better than ever before since American
occupation, and that there were no viola- ;
tion* of the anti-canteen law. :

*J* HE strike situation at midnight remained unchanged. Many rumors zvpre current during the day that violence tvas threatened,' but on investigation these, were, found; to be untrue. The United Railroads Company renewed its plea for
â¢* police protection, but Chief, of Police Wittman, acting under instructions from Mayor .Schmitz, declined to detail any policemen- for special service until the necessity -then for arose. The officers of the United Railroads appear to evade the
Peace conference suggested by the Mayor, and their actions indicate that the struggle will be protracted. Neither side shows signs oflzveakcning, and hints are already made by the railroad people that men will be imported from Chicago and other Eastern
cities to replace the strikers. The strikers are meeting daily, and all their instructions arc headed .with the injunction to preserve the peace at all hazards. Ninety-eight per cent of the street railway employes are noiv members of the union.

of the railroad company to which the franchise
is granted on the ground that said employe is

to comply with this condition shall work an
immediate forfeiture of the franchise granted
and the road or track constructed thereunder "
Whereas, It is the opinion of this board that
the street railroad companies of this city, which
have been granted valuable franchises and who
are using our public streets, for which the city
receives very little compensation for the valu
able concessions granted them, have no right
to discriminate against good, capable, honest
and efficient employes merely because they
have seen fit ta Join organizations for their per

Whereas, It is claimed that a sumber of em

city have been discharged from their positions
for no other reason except that they have be
come, members of certatn organizations which
have been organized for tho protection and wel

It is impossible for the company to discuss,
except with its employes, the business relations
of the company with its employes. Any re
quests you have to make as to wage* or hours
of labor the company is always ready te receive
and give thereto a fair and Just consideration.
Had . any such request been made* before you
quit work. I am satisfied it would have been
settled to our mutual satisfaction. But. as you
know, no request of. any kind was submitted to
the company by a single employe before tha
ceasation of the operation of the road on tha
morning of April 20. lÂ»02.
I therefore suggest that, in . all fairness, you
return to work, then make such requests in re
gard to wages and hours of labor as you desire,
and thus give the company the. ordinary busi
ness opportunity of considering the matter.
In this consideration I will add that the com
pany does net consider as a .material element
the fact of your membership or non-member
ship In any associations of railway or other
employes. That is a matter of your individual
judgment with which the company has no con
cern. Yours truly. HORACE G. PLATT.

As Illustrative of the ability to operate, the
cars with proper police protection and of the in
ability to operate them without, we beg to
Ftaf that this morning a Sacramento-street
car had no difficulty In making a round trip
with two police officers aboard, whereas, when
these two officers were withdrawn, the carmen
declined, through personal fear, to proceed fur
ther with their work. This is but an illustra
tion of the condition existing on all of i t'M
lines. That 'the fears of the "men. are n/t
wholly groundless and that there is urgent a*id
Immediate necessity for aproper police protec
tion is evidenced by the following incidents of
personal assault and physical damage lo prop
erty, which is but a partial list of similar inci
dents which have occurred since the strike-be
gan last evenlne:

Car Makes Bound Trip.
You can readily appreciate the Inconvenience
to the traveling public which will be occa
sioned by the stoppage of streetcar traffic in
ban Francisco, and tte therefore respectfully
ask that you aid the several companies In the
discharge of the duties which they owe to the
public in the operation, of their several street
car lines. From the facts before us It Is per
fectly apparent that with proper police protec
tion the effects of the strike will be shortlived
and the several lines affected will soon resume
their normal condition. This protection, how
ever, to be adequate must Include the presence
on each car so. operated of one or more police
officers to Insure the personal safety of the
men in charge of *aid car. "We believe that
two policemen on each car. one in the front of
the car and one In the rear end. will be suffi
cient, although, of course, subsequent events
would determine Just what would be necessary
and of which you. of course, would be enabled
to Judge better than ourselves.
Captain George W. Wlttman, Chief of Police
Hall of Justice. San Francisco. â Sir: - A strike
on the lines of. the street railways, belonging to
the United Ralroads of San Francisco, but still
operated by the former owners thereof, to wit:
The Market Street . Hallway Company, Sutter
Street Railway Company, Sutro Railroad Com
pany and " the San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric Railway. Company, has made it diffi
cult to operate Hhe cars on those lines in the
absence of police protection tor the men operat
ing same. The companies above referred to
have sufHclent men to operate the cars upon
their respective lines providing the men thus
engaged are properly protected . from personal
harm. ' . ' '.
The following .letter was received by
Chief 'of Police. Wittman from the United
Railroads yesterday: \
COMPLAINS
OF;VIOLENGE
OF STRIKERS
Chief of Police Wlttman stated that,
thus far no tendancy toward violence had
been shown, and that there was no neces
sity for protection, other than that which
could be. amply afforded by the regular
police force. The question as to the right
of private detectives to carry [ weapons
was discussed, and the conclusion of the
board, after having consulted the Politi
cal Code, was that their privileges were
no greater than any other citizen's, unless
they were added to, in the regular way
by the Police Commissioners.
Superintendent Vining of the United
Railroads sent a communication request
ing that the privilege of carrying a con
cealed weapon be granted to one Samuel
H. Plnkerton,- who is to be employed as a
watchman of the company's property.
As Vining's office boy had brtfught the
communication^ and no one appeared to
urge that it be granted, the board ordered
Pinkerton to appear at the next regular
meeting and state his request in person.
At -yesterday's meeting of- the Police
Commission the matter : of retail drug
gists selling liquor for medicinal purposes
was put over for discussion until tho next
regular meeting. ' :
Officers Hostitter, O'Shay, Dougherty
and Herring were fine* for leaving theii
beats, and Officer Rooker will contribute
to the police fund for not making a report
of why ha was absent from his beat.
the present car strike has been
settled. The matter was brought
to the attention of the board by Mayor
Schmitz, who not only sent a communica
tion, but .was present to discuss the situa
tion and to define the stand he takes re
garding the arming of private citizens. .
AT a. meeting of the. Police
Commissioners I held J yesterday
afternoon at the Hall of Justice
it was decided to refuse appli
cations for permits to carry
concealed weapons until after

that they Â¦ could secure employment. The
men are paid high wages in San Fran
cisco, the weather ., is gocd, and carmen
from the. East would be only too glad
to come to California.
"How many strikes have you been con
nected with, Mr. Huntington?" was asked
"Ten;" was the : reply, Vand I never
lost ' one of ' them. The biggest was the
Newport News strike last year.. It lasted
six weeks, ; and 7000 men were thrown out
of employment." They all voted unani
mously; at ! last that - they wanted , to
come back to work. " I don't- believe in
granting concessions to men when they
are out. They should be made. while they
are working." ' Â¦Â¦.
"What do you think thÂ« result of this
strike will.be?" was asked.
' "When I was with the Market-street
Railway," he . said, - "Mr. Vinlng used to
tell | me that the trouble was that the
men used Â»Xo work by the hour, and he
bad difficulty in keeping them from work
ing too many hours. They knew that the
ionger; they worked the more. money they
r.iade, and it was hard to -keep them off
the cars." .
Although TJre'y L. Ford la the leading
representative of the Baltimore syndicate,
the old attorneys of the Market Street
Hallway are still assisting in legal mat
ters until the 1st of May. Chief Counsel
W. F. Herrin of the Southern Pacific has
been in many conferences with the direc
tors of the United Hauroads since the
strike commenced. In an interview he
stated that the company stood in no dan
ger of losing its franchises.' He said a
railroad company could not lose a fran
chise except in a case of willful non-op
eration.'. "When physical force is used
against a road to prevent the operation of
its system the company is not to blame.
He further explained that if a railroad
can fully demonstrate that . through no
fault of its own it is unable to run cars
a court will take a lenient view of th-i
matter. . . Â¦',-:
H. E. Huntington was interviewed af
ter he Icft.the offices of the company yes
terday . afternoon and from hte remarks
it could be judged that he was simply
voicing the views of the directors of the
United Railroads. .-He says that the strike
was a great surprise to him, and though
he is no longer- connected with tne street
car systems in 'this city, he thought that
the men were perfectly with
their condition, j â¢ . - ~ â¢- . .
Acting President Arthur Holland was
closeted nearly all day with General Man
ager Vbiins. He left the offices of the
company aoout 4 o'clock and hurried on
to Market street. He refused to make
any statement, his only remark being:
"We intend to run our cars as soon as
possible; in fact, as soon as we can g-jt
the men."
President Holland was very nervous and
showed great resentment toward the
newspaper artists who tried to take his
picture. He declined to pose for a pho
tograph, and held the lapel of hia over
coat over his" face every time a camera
was leveled at him.
Â¦ The United Railroads have one street
car line operating, which has been un
affected, by the strike- This is the old
horse-car line that runs from Montgom
ery and California streets to the ferries.
There are two horse-cars - on this lin^,
and since the strike -the horse-cars have
been crowded on every trip. Superintend
ent'of-Construction H. H. 'Lynch has
charge of this line, and he was in a very
happy mood yesterday to think that this
road had been given the overlook by the
union car men. .
HOLLAND WILL NOT TALK.
Thus $50 has to belaid out by all the men
before they go to work.

As the days pass the necessity for
transportation by wagon becomes more
apparent. ; The owners of the vehicles are
earning good money and there is none
who is not inclined to wish them success
in their enterprise. Meanwhile- the out
side residents are wondering how long the
strike will last and just how long they
must be â¢ bundled . about in springless
wagons or walk. .
The vehicles which did the most busi
ness were those provided" with-.loud
voiced fellows who shouted through mega
phones that their teams were the best on
the street. One lusty chap yelled con
tinuall" "Here's the only palace car. on
the line; reserve your seats in time!" An
other informed the waiting puolic that
his "Pullman would start for Twenty
fourth and Valencia streets in ten min
utes." Each vehicle bore rudely painted
signs, indicating its destination and stat
ing the amount of the fare to be paid in
return for the. service rendered. This
was paid .without protest, the sentiment
being that the advanced rates were rea
sonable and just.
1 he spectacles that greeted pedestrians
throughout the day were not devoid of
interest. To the majority of the people
the sights were unusual and therefore
novel. To those who were compelled to
tramp to and from -their homes in the
absence of suitable conveyances, the ex
perience was one fraught .with discom
fort. Men had to get up by candle light
and leave their homes before dawn in or
der to report for duty three miles away at
7 a, m. -Many men Â¦ remained, "^downtown
all night in order to be on haad early in
the morning, Â¦ their old-time "excuse that
they missed the last car standing them -in
good stead when matutinal explanations
were in order. Â¦' * . Â¦ ks ;-Â¦Â¦ Â¦ i .,
Every old rattle-trap of. -a wagon in the
city and many attenuated specimens: of
horseflesh were in use along Market
street. These vehicles were provided
chairs and cloth-covered seats and pre
sented a very inviting aspect to the resi
dent who had to cover a trifle of twenty
blocks or so in order to reach his home.
Gaily dressed women did not disdain to
ride in trucks drawn by four horses, nor
did gentlemen with plug hats refuse to ac
cept seats in express wagons at 10 cents
a trip. Social distinction and forms were
forgotten for the time^nd all seemed to
enjoy the occasion as a picnic. Every
body smiled, and accepted the discomforts
of the hastily improvised accommodations
as a matter of course. The passengers
declined to become angry at anything, all
declaring that if they arrived home in
comparative safety they would regard the
experience of the; day as worthy of â¢ re
membrance as long as they lived. Â¦
To the residents in the outskiHu. of the
city the inauguration of the strike/was ji
very serious matter, for it involved un?
usually early rising and the exercise of
the pedal extremities to' a degree hitherto
unknown. Necessity is the mother of in
vencion. and it is not surprising, therefore,
that expressmen . and others; who had
wagons and horses lying around loose
concluded to press them ' into service.
That this was done was quite apparent to
any one walking along the main thor
oughfares after 6 p. m.
-,, v," latter '70's, when ox teams were
used in/transporting passengers from the
Palace Hotel to the, territory beyond the
Yerba Buena â¢ Cemetery, on which, the
City Hall now stands. But the gentleman
with the reminiscences was practically
forg-Jtten in the popular excitement 'at

their work Is not near as good as the work of
the white girls: â¢ , :
Hearst could set all the girls he would need
to pack his fruit crops. Chinamen ret the work
at his grove to the exclusion of white labor. I
have known whole families to come in in wa
gons and wait and wait in the hope of em
ployment, bat their waiting has been in vain.
One has only to let it be known and men and
women will come from all parts around. Many
keep away because of the employment of Chi
nese, who. by the way, never spend a cent of
their earnings other than that which goes for
rice and a little pork. It is a hardship on tho
willing workers of the place and surrounding
country.
Hans Frederickson. superintendent of
Major Hooper's orange grove, and who Is
admitted to be one of the most success
ful orchardlsts in. the Palermo colony,
said: . " â¢
Hearst talks a good deal in hia papers, thÂ«
Examiner, the Hew York Journal and his Chi
cago American, about the protection of the la
borer, but In view of the fact that he employ*
Chinese on his estates in Palermo. I should say
that all his talk Is for self, for politics and pa

M. E. Phares of Oroville has this to say
about the employment of Chinese on tha

I can not understand Hearst giving employ

should go to our own people. There Is plenty of
white labor ready and willing to work on the
Hearst orange groves and on the deciduous
fruit if he will let it be known that he wants
them and will not employ Chinese.
D. C. McCallum, a real estate man. of
Orovllle, takes the same view as Gray
and the Rev. Mr. Wallace and other pa
triotic citizens of the county in bitterly
opposing the employment of any but
white labor. Mr. McCallum hasÂ» this to
say about it:
It is altogether Â«ut of keeping with tho
preaching of his papers and his supposed pro
tection 'of the American laboring man in this
employment of Chinese upon Heart's estate.
During- last year's pocking: there was a
move to run the Chinese out. Three fires broka
out at Hearst's house. One wm accidental,
but two others were Incendiary. You see whita
men and w?men come in from afar and find
that the Chinese have sot the labor and thÂ»
men grrow ugly when they learn there's noth
ing for them through the employment of thejs
Chinese. Naturally It's a hardship on white

Hans Frederickson, an expert orchard
ist and superintendent of Major Hooper's

ment that Hearst pays his Japanese la

Although there is grave secrecy anent
the contract labor price Hearst pays his
Chinamen, it is presumed by those who
are an authority on such matters that the
ownÂ»r of "American papers for American
people" bestows upon his Chinese proteges
5 cents a box for packing, nailing and
loading his oranges. There are some who
assert their belief that Hearst pays 6

In the years 1897 â¢ and 1899 . W. Skinner
of Marysville purchased, the orange crop

of his employes is to this day. a matter
of record, and consequently there are
many regrets that the orange groves went

DISCONTENT GROWS
AMONG THE PEOPLE
While looking forward to the approach-
Ing orange season, the people of Palermo
elso look backward on the last two sea
eons' crops, which on W. R. Hearst's es
tate were gathered in and handled solely
by Chinamen to the exclusion and undis
guised disgust of the white labor of the
vicinity and outlying districts.
H is argued, that W. R. Hearst labels
each one of his newspapers with the pa
triotic and beautiful sentiment, "An
American Paper for American People,"
and that be trots out his patriotism, |
which, by tha way, is true Hearst parlot- ,
Ism. unique and anomalous, at a gait
which dazzles- the- easily dazzled, but can
never deceive those who think for them- '
selves and who distinguish the sterling
ring of the true patriot and rhilanthro
pist from the one who flaunts and ever
lastingly crows his counterfeit patriot
ism for the sake of self-aggrandizement,
Kelf-glcrification and pecuniary results.
For with all his flaunting of his "patriot
ism," with all his professions of love for
the American workingman, with all his
energy in the direction of installing him
self as the workingman's savior and pro
tector. Mr. Hearst strangely strays from
the path of the friend and protector and
in his private capacity as landlord and
land cwr.er he employs and pays and
patronizes that very Labor which he in
public condemns as a menace to Ameri
can institutions and the workingmen of
the country-

That the Chinese pack the fruits better
than the Americans Miss Klrby stoutly
denies She maintains that apart 1 from
the advantage of the cleanliness of the
Americans they pack the. fruit better and
more expeditlously than do the Chinese,
therefore she is at a loss to understand
Hearst's strange preference for the soiled
Oriental laborers, whose loathsome hand
touch should never contaminate the citrus
and deciduous fruits of the State.
Hearst does: not even find a single,ex
cuse in the expressed opinions of the
kindly clergyman, the Rev. Louis .Wal

most everybody. But in dlscusBing Hearst

That Hearst's treatment of the laboring
class of Butte County is deeply, resented
has been made known more tham once.
It was only last year that murmurs^of
discontent and indignation were heard on
the roadside and in the ' cottages. , The
American workingmen of Palermo and
those disappointed ones; who came to the
colony in the hopeof securing* work on
Hearst's estate. became disgruntled.; They
beheld the greasy, . unwashed Â¦ Mongolians

house while they* were made idle. So

other owners and superintendents of,or
chards thriving in the neighborhood of the
Hearst groves. . . .
Mr. Hearst can no longer stand upon
the excuse that his orchards and groves
are let to others, for beyond question they
have not been In the hands of any one else
but Hearst himself since Skinner gave
them up in 1899, and, as before stated,
when that gentleman purchased the crops
of that andithe preceding year he engaged
scores of white men and women to gather
in the oranges and pack and dispatch
them. He even brought with him from
Â¦Marysville a host of hands, American men
and women, to aid in the gathering and

AMERICANS MAKE

Then, why does Mr. Hearst lean so te
naciously toward the employment of
Chinese In his orange igroves?
He knows full well that he has only to.
announce that he will employ no more
Chinamen on his estates; that nevermore
will he have them picking and packing his
citrus and deciduous fruits, and he can be
inundated with Americans, sturdy men
and 'women, who are only too willing to
work. . Â¦ ..â¢.-Â¦Â¦
Surely were he paying them the price
asked by the American laborers, for whom
he has such concern, his offense, already
bad enough in giving preference to -the
Chinamen, would be even worse than it is.

HEARST'S CHINAMEN
"If there is to be exclusion," say the
good people of Palermo, "what will
Hearst do for labor when the Chinaman
beepmes scarce?"
It Is a notorious fact that Hearst for
the last two years has employed Chtna
n;en In large numbers to pick the
oranges, pack them and load" them. So
far, indeed, has he favored Chinese labor
that they have been employed to do ev
ery kind and description of work on his
vast estate. The excuse for such em
ployment of Chinese is that white labor
is scarce in the neighborhood, but against
such sophistry come the arguments of
Superior Court Judge John Carleton
Gray, who declares there is ample white
labor to be had If wanted. The Judge
declares that he would. not employ Chi
nese upon his orchards, and speaks of
their filthy habits, and, further, he has
no sympathy for any one who employs
Chinamen. :
deliberately gives employment to the Chi
naman to tbe exclusion of tbe American
worklngman.
Such is the condition on the Hearst es

a. '.new â¢ uiidergrour)/! railway, system, fn

testify, to-mor row before 'the House of
Lords committee which is now investigat
ing" Â¦"'the" whole' question or>the- under
ground transit of London in favor of the
construction of -a* new. system and guar
anteeing the Morgans' nnancial support.
Combined with the Morgans are the Sie
mens Brothers and other large British
interests;- The promoters expect they
>vill meet- with little dirticulty in -getting
"the . permission of the House: of Lords
committee for the~ construction of their
lines. A decision is expected to be reach
ed-within a -week/ whereupon the Mor
gans will immediately begin the work of
financing . the concern and constructing
the roiids. - The' importance of the scheme
consists chiefly in the amalgamation ef
lccted at the end. of last week under- the
Morgans' auspices of the various -pro-,
jected tubes,, .which, when constructed,
will extend forty -miles in a continuous
line north and to the west and southwest
of the? metropolis. These lines, in ' turn,
will .connect with ninety miles of sur
tace roads, the London 'United ; Electric
lramways being also a member. . of the
new syndicate.
First â The Uerman lines are to have such
representation on the board of control as to
prevent their being outvoted by the' Anglo-
American Interests. The German companies
will thus preserve their independence and will
no more be controlled by their associates than
they will control: them.
Seecnd â A pro rata distribution of profits ac
cording to tonnare will be made.
Third â The German cotripanlcs are to share
In the advantages derived from - whatever
asreement the combination makes with the
American railroad*. Besides these principles,
which broadly outline -the basis of Â¦ the-con
tract under which the union of the i German
lines is brought about, reports of othsr ideas,
. Ipsb easily understood,, are in ' circulation.
These are based upon seemingly, authoritative
Information. One of these reports Is that' It
is the purncss -of the allied line's that the
management of the combination - shall con
sist of -three' Broupa, of which the Hamburg-
American .Steam . Packet . Ooirrmny and the,
North German T^loyd line/ shall count' for two
and the- Anjjlo- American lines for. one. j â¢ .
The future working of the combination
appears to be provided' for by. a .system
which is largely automatic, thus avoiding
the- possibility of a conflict an-manage
ment.
The general terms under which the Ger
man steamship Iine3 have joined the inter
national shio combination are understood
to be as follows:
The real American peril, . continues the
Tageblatt, does not lie in American com
petition, but in the possibility of bold
American financiers entangling' German
business in unsound schemes. Â¦â¢
BERLIN, April 21.â The Berliner Tage
blatt expresses the belief , that although
the profits of the Â¦â¢ German lines .may
temporarily increase, it will be at; the cost
pf free government in the future ahd the
exposure of German business to destruc
tion,- which American foolhardiness and
American conceit of their greatness are
sure to bring about. 'Â¦
The Pall Mall Gazette thinks the ar
rangement gives the United States an
enormous pull on the Atlantic, and j that
it is not creditable to Great Britain that
English steamship lines should be.domi
nated by Americans.
LONDON, April 21.â What is called the
"Morganlzlng" of the greater section of
the Atlantic ferry, is causing mugh'per
turbation in Great Britain^ The West
minster 4 Gazette suggests it may be en
titled to the grave attention of the gov
ernment, as in some quarters it is Insisted
that the "vital interests of the empire in
time of war may be jeopardized by the
new arrangement," arid almost In the same
breath the paper reiterates the argument
used when the combination was .first
mooted that it would be a powerful peace
factor between America and Great Brit
ain, for the great American financiers
must find it to their own intertst to use
their influence against war between the
two~countries.

the Cherokee Nation, William Phillips
was instantly killed and Mayfleld, Jeaa
Skidmore and Lige Johnson were mortal
ly wounded. All are prominent cattle
men, who own pastures not far from Col

All four men were In .CollinsvUle dur

ly expecting trouble. Late in the arter
noon Hkidmore and Johnson left for
Colagah, near CollinsvUle. and a few
milea west met Mayfield and Phillips
awaiting them by- the roadside. Without
any preliminary words Mayfleld leveled
his shotgun and fired at Skidmore. who
lecetved the load in- h!s right breast.
As the wounded man reeled from the
saddle he turned his gun on Phillips, wno
had also raised his gun to fire at him.
and shot Phillips through the heart. As
Skidmore fell trom his horse Mayfleld.
turned his gun on Johnson and both men
fired simultaneously. Mayfield . waÂ»
wounded in the shoulder and Johnson in
the side. Though desperately wounded,
both men fired again and again, each
man's shot taking effect. Friends who
had feered trouble and who had followed
Skidmore and Johnson from Collinsviile,
arrived at this point and prevented the

Though fatally wounded, they were at

Agents of the Boers, who are deeply in

declared this afternoon that the facts as
stated in the report show conclusively
that there has been a violation of neu
trality. The fact that the report Is to be
made public so promptly, together with
tho instructions of the President to
Colonel Crowder to make additions to the
document, has created the hope among
British diplomats, on the other hand, that
it has been found that the agents of their
Government have acted entirely within
the neutrality laws. â¢
The Boers say that the effect of the In
vestigation will certainly result ln mak
ing the British more circumspect At the
same time they are hopeful to-night that
the President will notify the British Gov
ernment that it Is desirable to withdraw
the British officers who are engaged in
the purchase and transportation of ani
mals to South Africa. s
Representative Cochrane of Missouri
made a speech in. the House to-day ln
which he argued that it waa the bounden
duty of the Government to stop the ship
ment of war material to South Africa.
He declared that within forty miles of his
home there was a British garrison en
gaged in buying war supplies, and said
the existence of a camp near New Or
leans was notorious. â¢ .
In accordance with the ' request of, the

in contributing to party success, he owed

STOCKTON. April 2Lâ A romantic wed
ding took place this morning at the resi
dence of Rev. "W. C. Evans, pastor of the
Central Methodist Episcopal Church. The
participants were Parker John Wilson, a
wealthy young ward of Sheriff Slbley, and
Miss Irma Daisy Crothers, who was for
merly a "hello" girl.
Wilson and Miss Crothers were out
driving one day. when an accident oc
curred which threw them from their vehl.
cle. both being injured. This incident cul
minated in an engagement, and this morn
ing the marriage took place. They had
plannedfcto wed sooner, but Wilson, being
under age, had to wait until he could ob
tain the consent of his guardian. Sheriff
Sibley withheld his consent until he felt
certain the young people were not actine
entirely upon impulse. Seeing- that they
were very devoted and bent upon mar
riage, he at last yielded.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson left for Mexico
where they will spend their honeymoon.

"I never have," replied Gillett "But I
never have been mean enough to criticize
a. man who has done so."
Gillett replied that the incident referred
to occurred at Springfield, not Boston,
and he explained that Washington was
refused lodgings at two hotels because
they were full and could not accommo
date him. but. he said, the proprietor of
one of them made every effort to secure
lodging for him elsewhere, and invited
him to come to his hotel for his meals.
Glllett explained that in New England
they could understand the prejudices in
the South against the negro and against
negro domination, but the people of his
section insisted that social ostracism
should not be visited on those who did
not share these prejudices. When a' ne
gro man raised himself above his fellows
and led a pure, clean, manly life, he
thought his worth should be recognized.
He did not sympathize with a state of
society which accepted a man whose
hands were stained with the blood of a
lynching cr with election frauds and who
rejected a worthy, pure man simply be
cause his color was black.
"Do not dodge this issue." cried GH

Gilbert's remarks drew a reply from
Glllett of Massachusetts. Glllett said he
Â¦was willing to admit the prejudice
against the negro in New England. He
thought that perhaps there was a greater
physical repugnance toward the negro
there than in the South. But because one
man personally felt a prejudice against
the negro he did not think he had a right
to attempt to force them upon others.
Bartlett Interrupted to ask whether
some time ago Booker T. Washington
was not refused lodgings at the hotels in
Boston.
During the general debate on the mili
tary academy bill Gilbert of Kentucky
precipitated a discussion on the race
question. Gilbert took' occasion to reply
to some remarks recently made by Gil
lett of Massachusetts, Bromwell of Ohio
and General Funston, which he thought
reflected upon his State. In the course of
his remarks Gilbert said that in Ken
tucky, and, in fact, in all the South, they
looked with supreme contempt upon the
eocial equality of the races. The most
Ignorant white girl in the State, he said,
would infinitely prefer to marry the low
est, meanest, most ignorant white man
In the world than the most cultivated ne
gro in America. Gentlemen on the other
side could not cry down the "taint in the
blood." Hla recalled the fact that when
a colored man sat on the other side of thÂ»
house not one of his colleagues invited
him to his house. The prejudice against
eocial equality was as strong in the
North as in the South, he declared, and
all talk to the contrary was "hypocritical
rant and rot."

Yonr Decision This Day Is All-
Important.
Paine's Celery
Compound
Guarantees a Freedom From
Diseasa and Sickness.
INDIFFERENCE AND CARELESSNESS
LEAD TO PHYSICAL SHIPWRECK
AND THE GRAVE.
The weak, aillny. sick and disease*
have now more than ever before under
their control their physical condition.
They are free agents and almost wholly
responsible for their future. When the
brain Is not affected, and the mind can
discern between right and wrongr. a duty
to themselves, their friends and country
loudly demands a marked decision-
prompt and determined action when
health is impaired and life is In danger.
It is the part of wisdom that true de-
cision be made to-day; to-morrow may
be too late. In thousands of cases the
checking and banishment of disease de-
pends upon Instant action; an hour lost
frequently means ; the snuffing out . ot .
some precious life.
Few people in our country are without
some knowledge of the wondrous, life-
giving virtues of Paine's Celery Com-
pound, a medicine that guarantees re-
lease from the diseases common to life.
. What will your decision be to-day, poor
sufferer? Will you give Paine's Celery
Compound the fair and honest testing
that others are giving It. with Its cer-
tain reward of health, strength, vigor
or happiness, or will you remain Indif-
ferent and careless, content to pass
your few days or weeks In misery, ag-
ony and wretchedness until the dark
grave claims you as Its victim?
It is almost needless to enumerate ths
blessed results that flow from Paine's
Celery Compound when* used promptly la
springtime, as you and your friends have
a knowledge^of them. Of this you may
be assured: the seeds of disease are ban-
ished, the system is fortified, the blood
Is made red and pure, the nerves braced,
digestion" regulated, headaches, side-
aches and backaches forever dispelled,
and sweet, restful" sleep takes the plac*
of insomnia.

Passing .from the end sought by this ambitious
scheme to the means for its attainment, we touch
ground that is* so intensely speculative as to put it on
To the* credit of the dreamer of this dream be it
said that he made it plain that the t plan had among
its. uses the humane purpose of preventing.war. But
he left out of his estimate that the condition to which
it would subject all other nations, including Adam
Zad, the Bear, would come to be less tolerable than
war. He also omitted from his calculation that such'
a combination would immediately ; force a combina
tion of all the other nations in self-defense, and that
with Germany and Russia in the lead of such a com
petitive organization the scheme would be more
likely to cause war than to procure peace, and that
such a war would exceed, in the stake for .which ,'the^
bloody game was played and in its sanguinary inci
dents all the" wars combined that the world has seen
and suffered. .
The distinguished man who seems to have had his
recreation in these visions conceived a union of An
glo-Saxon nations, with one capital at Washington
and the other at London. The administration was to
alternate every four years between the two. This
combined . Anglo-Saxon power was to" have the he
gemony of the world, the leadership merely, not the
government of the nations outside. Still, it would
be a great political, industrial and financial trust,
which would rule, without administering, every' other
nation. It could prevent war loans, and thereby
compel peace. It could stop the supply of food and
clothing to a recalcitrant people and command their
submission to its will.
THE publication by Mr. Stead of the rhapsody
of Cecil Rhcfdes, upon which it is supposed that
his legacy to international education was
founded, while it detracts from no estimate of what
he was, does affect the measure of what, he aspired to
be. The composition of his expression of his ideas
is, as Mr. Stead admits, obscure in style and halts
through involved sentences, so that one extracts the
meaning often to feel fatigued by the labor, j Still, as
a whole, the composition leaves no one in doubt of
the author's meaning, and when that is grasped the
importance of the scheme is found to depend entirely
upon the great position of its author and is not at all
intrinsic. ,;

It is rare that a campaign opens with so near an
spproach to complete accord of sentiment as now
prevails among the rank and file of the Republican
camp. In fact, the only sounds or signs of dissent
:ome from the factioa that has been lined up to sup
port Gage and Assembly constitutional amendment
No. 28. Outside of that small but energetic crowd
there is a virtually unanimous conviction that either [
Gage must be defeated in the convention or the party
.viJl be defeated at the polls.
The utterances of the Republican papers on this
subject were strikingly confirmed by the proceed
ngs of the convention of the State League of Re
publican Clubs. At that gathering of stalwart party
vorkers from all sections of the State it was noted
hat the only disturbing element in the convention
vas made up of the Gage faction, and the only irri
ating incident was the Gage letter declining to at
end the convention and insulting every aspirant for
he Governorship who did attend it.
With no other obstacle to success than the faction
ight of the bosses and their henchmen, it ought to
le comparatively easy for Republicans to make cer
ain of a sweeping victory in the coming campaign,
f genuine Republicans will attend the primaries and
he preliminary work of organizing for the canvass,
f they will send as their representatives to the State
onvention stalwart Republicans who will refuse to
ake orders from Billy Herrin or any other railroad
â¢oss, the result will be the defeat of Gage's schemes,
he adoption of a platform denouncing the proposed
orporation amendment to the constitution, and the
ominaticn of a ticket that will carry the State by an
iverwhelming majority.
At this time the outlook is decidedly encouraging,
'artly by his subservience to Billy Herrin and partly
y his natural rudeness and insolence, Gage has of
mded nearly every class of Republicans. ' Some
ave been affronted by his swaggering support of
)an Burns for the Senate, some by his refusal
irough spiteful motives to assent to bills providing
yr the public, welfare, some by his degradation of
le Normal schools to the exigencies of boss poli
cs, some by the removal of Dr. Osborn from the
lome for Feeble-Minded Children to make a place
>r a tax-eating politician, some by the general unfit
ess of his appointments to office, and some by his
elight in saying spiteful and malicious things upon
!1 occasions, regardless alike of truth and of pro
riety.
Without the aid of the corporation political ma
line Gage would have no chance whatever to get
.â¢en so much as a mention for renomination. Backed
r the machine, however, he is formidable. â¢ Through
terailroad^fcosses in the Democratic camp, a mot
y gang of Democratic rooters and heelers will be
â¢nt to vote this year at the Republican primaries,
id as a consequence there may be elected to the
invention a considerable number of henchmen hav
g no other political ambition than that of obeying
ilroad orders., Through their votes Gage hopes to
in out, and it must be admitted that if genuine Re
iblicans are in the least neglectful of their political
ities the chances of the bosses will be by no means
:ght.
Such being the case, it is gratifying to find the
press of the State acting harmoniously in
using the party to z sense of the danger. This is
ie of the occasions when the stalwarts must get
gether before the State convention occurs. Vic
ry will be easily won under a leader whom the
ople respect and whom the party will support with
dor, but tinder the leadership of Gage defeat is
rtain. The voters of the State did not know him in
s first ; canvass, but they know him now and will
ver re-elect him. .
Â£^ ROM the Republican press of every section of
< the State there come words of good cheer for
the party. Their utterances show substantial
nimity upon every notable issue of the coming
campaign. The counsel of all is for a united, har
monious party, and most of them add the plain
declaration that the only obstacle in the way of har
mony is the persistent effort of the railroad bosses to
force the renomination of Gage.

The reports which have forced Senator Hanna to
make such emphatic denials are among the most
curious features of the politics of the time. No one
can trace a single one of them to any authoritative
source. They .are apparently as worthless as the
"specials" of yellow journals, and yet they find circu
lation everywhere and are gravely discussed from one
end of the Union to the other. Some time ago the
New York Tribune, in commenting upon their per
sistence said: "Unless Hanna with a loud oath jumps
into the air and declares he is- not a candidate, and
then jumps down with all his' weight on what ap
pears to be a movement to make him a candidate,
President Roosevelt will have a good deal of trouble
before the next : National Republican Convention
meets." The desire to find a leader for a Republican
opposition to the President is not in itself surprising.
No President can satisfy all^the office-seekers or
patronage brokers in his party, and those who are
disappointed very naturally, seek for a new deal. This,
we believe; is, however, the most persistent effort
ever made to force a man to accept such leadership.
Senator Hanna is wise in avoiding it, and, now that
he has been so emphatic iiv-repudiating the report
it is to be hoped he will have no further trouble
with it.- . *" _â¢ ' . - \ ______ \
This emphatic statement of Mr. Hanna was made
to a number of Senators, and Washington corre
spondents declare it to be the general sentiment at
the capital that the Senator is absolutely sincere in
his declarations. He not only has no thought of be
coming a candidate for the Presidency, but he finds
that the persistent reports, of his candidacy and the
evident intention of some persons to force him, as it
were, to accept the opposition to Roosevelt is inter
lering with what has become a strong ambition, the
desire to devise some means of settling controversies
between labor and capital without recourse to strikes,
which are so disastrous to all concerned and which
frequently lead to bloodshed.
The reference to his work as chairman of th.6 Na
tional Board of Arbitration gives to that statement
much more interest than would attach to a mere de
niaLof Presidential' aspirations. The Senator seems
himself to have realized that, for he went on to say:
"If these fool people, some of whom are my friends
and others my enemies, would stop talking about my
being, a candidate for President, I am confident I
could accomplish something of real benefit to the
country jn the task I have undertaken to bring about
a thorough' and permanent understanding between
Capital and labor, or between the employing and the
working classes. My work along this line is greatly
embarrassed, if not actually hampered, by the fre
quent talk of my being a candidate for President.
* * ?- I would rather be instrumental fn bringing
the. employing classes- and the working; classes to
gether, so that, strikesVand "other. industrial .^disturb
ances would be minimized, if not wholly abolished,
and have credit for that achievement placed upon my
tombstone, than be President of the United States."
SENATOR HANNA has become much ;â¢ an
noyed by. the' persistent reports that he will' be
a candidate for the Presidential nomination . in
1904. He has once more repeated' his declaration:
"lam not a candidate for President and do not eje
pect to become a candidate. I wish everybody to un
derstand that, so that I can go on with the task as
signed me by the National Civic Federation without
having my motives viewed with suspicion."

It would seem, then, to be imperative that the tour
of troops in the islands be shortened. Spain, with
a soldiery "much more resistant to the influence of
the climate than ours, found two years to be the
maximum time that it was safe to keep troops there.
There may now be no doubt that the erratic atroci
ties committed by Spain, of which we have so much
complained, were in large part attributable to the
very cause >we are j discussing. We are persuaded
that it will -be safer for us to limit the tour of our
troops to one year. There will be less to regret in
the islands and fewer military pensions to pay by and
by if this is done, and, though such a policy will be
at present costly, it will be economy in the long run.
As we began with a mistaken estimate of climatic
enmity, it need not be wondered at that we have
continued in the original error until. we are jolted out
of our preconceptions by events which profoundly
impress the humanity of the country. There should,
under the circumstances, be no pride of opinion to'
restrain us from righting ourselves, and promptly,
before there are more of such occurrences as these
which warrant action now.
Nothing will be gained by sending an erroneous
view on up, to be shared by headquarters. That will
be no remedy at all. The climate is not going to
change to please us. The vertical sun is not going
into a horizontal decline because it shines on
Americans. Physical conditions will remain fixed,
and if there be any mitigating influence it must come
of accommodating our policy to them, not them to it.
Unhinged for judgment, the officers visit punish
ments upon the offenders that would not be per
mitted to any officer -in the United States. But be
cause the officers misjudge the men is no reason
for misjudgment of the officers. They are entitled
to the same leniency of judgment with which the pri
vates should have been treated by them.
The special twelve who were shot are shot, and that
ends them. Their fate is of far less consequence than
the policy toward the people of Samar put in the or
der of General Â¦ Smith. It must be 'remembered that
Waller made oath to that order and that he regarded
it as justification of his act. The verdict of the court
martial is an indorsement of the testimony of Waller.
Now what is to be dyone?
The first conclusion is that Washington heeds to
be in closer touch with military operations in the
Philippines. The .officers in command there need
to feel some superior limitation upon the power they
exercise. It is already in evidence that the climate
has an effect upon men and officers that after awhile
unfits them for judgment. The rapidly spreading'
complaints of bad treatment of our own soldiers by*
their officers indicate this. These complaints maice
it evident that climatic effects upon the men make
them reckless. of discipline.' To this there are many
accessory causes. The long distance from home, the
novel and often unpleasant surroundings, the fatigue
of marches and a diet new to them and the despair,
that makes men reckless, all indicate that^the ranks
suffer from conditions that no human power can con
trol. They inhere in natural conditions which have
been recognized in the experience of all countries
that have carried on military operations in ' the
tropics. When the consequences of these novel con
ditions appear in the conduct of the men, their of
ficers, wrought upon by the same influences, judge
them as they would for similar conduct at home,
where the conditions would make it flagrant, and im-.
pute to the guilty a turpitude which should not be
charged to them in the tropical service.;
THE court-martial trying Lieutenant Waller for
shooting prisoners on Samar has acquitted him. .
This action carries with it several considera-*
tions that must be* squarely met. The inci
dents of the trial went past Waller to his military su
perior. In his-pwn testimony in justification. of his
act the lieutenant went beyond any act of the pris
oners as justification for shooting them and swore
that he was ordered by General Smith to shoot pris
oners. He did not: limit this order to sex, but when
asked as to the age of persons to be shot General;
Smith replied, "All over ten years old."
We desire to consider only in a dignified way. this
colossal conception, but We are compelled to believe
that its author's claim to immortality, must rest upon
something less vague and' fantastic. Â¦-
Naturally 'he reasoned that, given the power of the
combined wealth of the. Anglo-Saxon world, used by
a secret organization, allegiance and sovereignty, civil
institutions, national pride and all could be led cap
tive into a combination that would powerfully appeal
to the imaginations of men and lead them captive
into a combination that would use .' the energies of
millions of men and billions' of ' mbneV to a
federation, that the sober mind would look upon as
fantastic in conception and upon the secret means for
its attainment as'essentiaily puerile. .' # ,Â¦
All this grand partnership of a race Was not to be
effected by a sentiment publicly promoted. It was
not to be the fruit of open discussion. It was not to
be born of any of the means used in the evolution of
races and the growth of nations, but by a secret so
ciety that should represent the wealth of the Anglo-
Saxon race. This secret society . was to be copied'
from Ignatius Loyola, and was to be made pervasive
of the race selected as the beneficiary of the scheme.
He no doubt carried this idea over from his experi
ence of the power of mcJney acquired as the organizer
of the De Beers diamond trust and the South African
Company. In' their field of operation >he had seen
these two organizations prevail over all things. They"
had changed political geography, transferred sover
eignty; shifted national allegiance and almost defied
nature herself. â¢' ' â¢' . Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ .'Â¦'Â¦ Â¦ ..

generous robbers held up two working
men near Baird Spur on Friday night.

ROBINSOX, Cal., April 21.â The Melones
Mining Company has begun operations,
there now being sixty stamps dropping
daily. The gigantic plant has been under
way since 1897. It has taken a little less
than $1,000,000 to perfect the plant. Wa
ter power Is being used for. all purposes.
The water is taken from the Stanislaus
River and flumed four miles to the mill.
Great expectations are hinging upon the
results of the milling, as mother lode
mining is growing in favor with capital
and should the Melones yield dividends
there will be a pronounced increase in the
number of operative companies.

"We do not contemplate building to the
coast," continued Cable. "In every essen
tial but that of owning our own line to
the Pacific we are now a coast road. We
are doing a through freight business and
running through passenger cars from Chi
cago to Los Angeles and San Francisco,
and next fall we will put on a train serv
ice from Chicago to the coast."
Cable would not speak of the connec
tions that would be made by the projected
new line to Salt Lake, whether it woulu"
reach the coast over the Clark road, or if
the agreement now existing with the Har
riman lines would be extended to the Cen
tral Pacific and the new extension of the
Oregon Short Line would be the outlets..
"That line will be built. There'is a rich
country in Northern Colorado not reached
by any railroad that offers many induce
ments to railroad builders. The line pro
jected to run directly west from Denver,
across the mountains, would be shorter by
at least 150 miles than the Denver and Rio
Grande and shorter than the Union Pa
cific.
LOS ANGELES. April 21.-The first Offi
cial confirmation of the plans for western
extensions of the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific Railroad was given to-day by
Â«, R. Cable, chairman of the board of
directors of the Rock Island company.
Cable said that a western extension from
Denver would be the first undertaking of
h!s company. A line through to the coast
-would not be undertaken because the
present joint traffic agreements with the
Southern Pacific were so satisfactory that
there was no need of another line. When
the rumor of a new line through northern
Colorado to Salt Lake was mentioned,
Cable said:
Special Dispatch to The Call.
At the Coroner's inquest to-day nothing
was developed as to the original cause or
responsibility for the disaster. Captain
Phillips testified that he could not ac
count for the origin of the fire unless an
electric wire had started It. He stated
that so far as he knew there were fifty
six lives lost.
The Coroner was advised of other bod
ies being recovered at distances from this
city, but none of them have been identi
fied. A careful estimate by those who
were aboard the City of Pittsburg to
night puts the loss of life at snety-three
as the lowest, and the. opinion of some is
that the list will approximate 100. Of this
appalling death list only three bodies
have been recovered and Identified up to
a late hour to-night. All of the injured
are being well cared for and are recover
ing. All who escaped from the burning
boat without their effects have been
clothed and made comfortable, and most
of them have departed for home.
No attempt to recover bodies has been
xnade yet in either wreck or river.
CAIRO, 111., April 21.â After searching
two days the death roll of the burned
Bteamer City of Pittsburg has not been
reduced any from the first reports. Of the
145 persons who were on the boat when
it burned yesterday about half are still
missing, and to-night no further hope for
them is expressed. The books and valu
ebles of the boat, crew and passengers
ere still in the ruins. The wreck is above
Â¦water and is still smoldering to-night.
Owing to the heated condition of the hull
searjh for those cremated in it has not
been begun, and few of the bodies of
those who wens drowned have been re
covered owing to the swift current at the
scene of the disaster.

Projects.

Concerning the St. Louis Exposition Mr.
Barrett said that It would surpass the Co
lumbian and also the Paris Exposition.
When the gates open the sum of $25,000,000
will have been expended. The Chamber
of Commerce extended a vote of thanks
for the Information given. I
"Japan," said Mr. Barrett, "is the
Great Britain of the Far Bast. She has
an immense population in" a small area.
Like Great Britain she must make vast
demands for our raw products, such as
breadstuff s, of which the Pacific. Coast
can provide the largest portion. The fact
that Japan has 40,000,000 people accessible
to foreign trade, whose buying and selling
capacity is growing rapidly, and that she
has developed her foreign commercial ex
change from $30,000,000 to $300,000,000 in
thirty years was quoted.
A mistake made now will cost Calif or*
nia, Oregon and Washington millions of
dollars. This remark was called fori~ by
tne consideration of the placing of a
high duty in China \ upon the Pacific
Coast products, like flour. While much Is
said about China, Mr. Barrett said that
not enough attention is paid to Japan,
which offers greater opportunities in the
immediate future than does China for the
development of American . trade. It will
be twenty-five years, so said the speaker,
before China will stand, commercially,
where Japan stands to-day.
Commissioner General Barrett of the
St. Louis Exposition addressed the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon on
the subject of the exposition and the in
terest that the Pacific Coast- has in the
big show. He said that this is a most
critical^tlme for California and the en
tire country In the development of trans
pacific commerce. The efforts of Liuro
pean nations are being put forth to close
the doors against the products of ihe
United States. Competition and dlscrlm
Ination are *theii" chief weapons.' Unless
the Government and the exporters of the
United States guard the situation care
fully the Pacific Coast will fail to realize
its expectations in the Orient.

TO HARRIMAN
HOWARD-STREET wharf No. 2
collapsed during the early hours
or yesterday morning and pre
cipitated into the bay the Beaver
Hill coal bunkers and. ajxmt 1600
tons of coal. The bunkers were complete
ly wrecked and private property valued
at more than $25,000 was dumped into the
bay as the result of the accident. Â¦_Â¦
The bunkers were the property or J.
D. Spreckels & Bros.* Company and the
' coal was owned by W. G. Stafford & Co.
The bunkers were built about six years
ago at an expense of over $16,000 and were
thoroughly overhauled , and renewed
where necessary less than a year ago.
The wharf was a teredo-eaten structure
of a dozen summers and that its rotten
condition was responsible for the acci
'dentsuch of -the remains as are still in
sight.bear convincing testimony.
The collapse occurred about A o clock
yesterday. morning. The berth alongside
the bunkers was vacant, the steamship
Czarina having hauled away on Satur
day morning. So far as can be ascer
tained at present, there was no loss of
The bunkers were not loaded to their
full capacity, about 200 tons having been
hauled away since the last ship, the
Czarina, finished unloading. W. G. Staf
ford & Co., the owners of the coal, say
the bunkers contained about 1600 tons of
coal at the time of the accident and that
the bunkers have been subjected many
times to a much greater strain. v "
The crumbled remains of the wharf tell
a plain tale- of the ravages, of time and
teredo and the Harbor Commissioners are
blamed for having neglected the Import
ant duty of inspecting this part of the
property under their care. Temporary re
pairs were under way on the side of the
wharf remote from the bunkers, but the
side supporting the heavy structure,
where the ravages of the teredo have long
been apparent to the most casual ob
server, has been left to take care of it
self. Â¦ -..- . Â¦ \ ,
The revenue cutter. Thetis struck the
end of the wharf last week and gave it
a violent Jar. There was quite a heavy
earthquake on Saturday morning. The"se
disturbances are thought to have com
pleted the work. of the teredo.
L. D.' Norton, chief engineer of the Har
bor Commission, -says- the accident was
the result of- overloading" the bunkers and
that in his opinion the bunkers and not
the wharf gave way. The appearance of
the debris does not bear out this theory,
however, but In any event an investiga
tion will be held. â¢ ' .â¢ _ ' >Â¦ .

No other female medicine in the world has received such
widespread and unqualified endorsement. No other medicine
has such a record of cures of female troubles.
Those women who refuse to accept anything else are re-

Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
It will entirely cure the worst forms of Female Complaints, all Ova-
rian troubles, Inflammation and Ulceration, Falling and Displacement
of the "Womb, and 'consequent Spinal Weakness, and is peculiarly
adapted to the Change of Idfe.
It has cured more cases of Backache and Leucorrhcea than>any
other remedy the wqrld has ever known. It i3 almost infallible in such
cases. It dissolves and expsls tumors from the Uterus in an early staga
of development, and checks any tendency to cancerous humors.
.Irregular, Suppressed or Painful Menstruation, Weakness of the
Stomach, Indigestion, Bloating, Flooding, Nervous Prostration, Head-
ache, General Debility quickly yields to it.
/Womb troubles, causing pain, weight, and backache, instantly re-
lieved and parrfanently cured by its use. Under all circumstances it
acts in harmony with the laws that govern the female system, and is as
. harmless as water. Â¦
It quickly removes that Bearingr-down Feeling, extreme lassi-
tude, " don't care " and " want-to-be-left-alone " feeling, excitability,
irritability, nervousness, Dizziness, Faintness, sleeplessness, flatulency,
melancholy or the "blues," and backache. These are sure indications
of Female Weakness, or some derangement of the Uterus, which this
medicine always cures.
Kidney Complaints and Backache of either sex the Vegetable
Compound always cures.

The Iron Trades Council last night adopt
ed .the following resolutions:
The statement that violence was. of
fered to Newton is vehemently denied. It
is admitted that hot language was used,
but "the* Interference of a policeman. It is
claimed, was absolutely unnecessary. Thu
statement that rocks were hurled through
windows Is denied, and this is supported
by the fact that the. carhouse windows
were intact last night. The strikers ex
press great annoyance at the spread of
reports of violence, which, they declare,
are absolutely without foundation. .
One of the carmen who witnessed the
occurrence stated last night that the af
fair was greatly exaggerated. He re
marked that Newton was upbraided for
his conduct on Sunday In taking out a
car ..and. he admitted that. "It. was the
mistake, of his life." Newton expressed
a desire to Join the Union, and during the
afternoon he paid his fee and was.ajimit-'
ted into the ranks of organized labor.-
ThlÂ« morning, at about 3 o'clock, at -}he
Twenty-ninth and Mlssloh streets carhouse, an
alarm was given on the door by a police officer
and tha watchman In the Inside ..of the car
house opened the door. When the door was
opened the policeman pushed in forcibly Motor
man J. W. Newton, as he :was being attacked
by a mob on the outside. Immediately after
Newton's entrance into the carhouse the mob
began hurling rocks at the windows and "doors,
breaking several windows In the front of the
carhouse. They then devoted their attention to
the rfear of the carhouse and hurled several
rocks against the windows and tried to Weak
in the doors so they could get at Newton.' The
employes In the Inside of the carhouse had to
hide the man. He was then concealed, so that
In case the doors were broken open they would
not be able to find him. A short time alter
this disturbance Motorman Newton decided that
it would be better for him to leave the service
of the company and he turned in his badge and
buttons and left the premises. At the present
time we do not know his whereabouts.
A fracas of some sort occurred at.. the
carhouse at Mission and ' Twenty-ninth
streets at 3 o'clock yesterday morning.
According to the statement of an official
of the United Railroads, an attempt was
made by several of the striking carmen
to attack Motorman J. W. Newton, who
took out a car for Manager Vining on
Sunday afternoon. The statement of the
company's representative is as follows;

Tho American flag which veiled the

Bell, the little daughter of W. H. de Bell,
former principal of . the school, at the
close of the invocation by Rev. G. B.
Hatch and the singing by the school of
"Nearer, My God, to Thee." The exer
cises occurred in'front qt the school build
ing, where the bust rests on a concrete
pedestal four feet high, situated midway
between the entrance to the school and
the street. A large crowd was. present.
Â¦ C. L. Biedenbach, principal of the Me-
Klnley School, had charge of the exer
cises. He delivered the opening address,
saying in part:
This likeness is .not a monument for tha
dead. . William McKinley needs no monument
to preserve his ' memory. His deeds are s j
Used in history that they will endure foreyer
without. any record of stone. The memory 'of
his virtues has become so much a part of tha
consciousness of his fellow citizens that u
cannot lade. ' 'Â¦" .
tS."D. Waterman, City Superintendent ot
'Schools, made a few appropriate remarks
and at the close introduced H. H. Wood
ruff, ttrst lieutenant of Company A, Vet
eran Reserves, and a member of the Ohio
regiment in which McKinley fought dur
ing the Civil War. Lieutenant Woodruff
spoke of the young soldier who had been
a comrade-in-arms, and told of his life at
the front. He said that the Grand Army

Or course, the action of the directors Is

option. Should this offer be accepted by the
stockholders by the deposit of a sufficient num

which to take up the stock, i Â¦
Meanwhile no change of management Is im

Oakland Office San .Franeisco Call,
' V" lil8 I-troadway, April 21.
Attorney de Golia, in th* short argu
ment that he made, tried "to show that
the Assessor was guilty of malfeasance
because he had done something knowing
that it was unlawful. Attorney Fitzger
ald was satisfied to let the case* go to the
Judges without argument and. after a
few minutes' deliberation, the Court ren
dered its decision, as stated.
The statement made by Dalton "to the
Auditor in 18?9 was submitted by the
prosecution to show that Dalton had ustrd
deputies in his office paid by the county
to work on the city assessment rolls and
then overcharged for their work. DaI
ton succeeded in showing, however, that
the prosecution did not . read thiugs
straight.
Then Mr. Fitzgerald took the stand to
tell that he had advised Mrj Dalton to
retain all fees when the question as " to
his rights came up in 1S93.
Dalton followed to corroborate all that
his attorney said. He told about writing
to every County Assessor in the State to
ascertain what they did in regard to fee&.
All were of the opinion that he had a
right to retain. the fees.- He denied that
he ever had any intent to wrongfully re
tain fees.
As Mr.' Whidden's was all the testi
mony offered by the prosecution* Attor
ney Fitzgerald moved for a dismissal A
the charge on the ground of lack of proof
of intent to commit fraud. The Judges
wanted to hear some more testimony,
however, and denied the motion.
Testimony-taking in the case did not
amount to much. The prosecution only
had one witness and the defense was sat
isfied with two. Attorney de Golia fcr
Ibe prosecution called upon l>eputy Aud
itor Myron H. \Vhidden to tell about Dal
ion's neglect to account -for poll tax fees
and fees that he collected from the city
of Oakland for assessment rolls the last
three years. He told how Dalton had set
tled for the fees collected from the city
by paying into the treasury $4OS7 in ac
cordance with a recent decision of Judge
Ogden.
"The Court finds that the defendant aid
retain and neglect to pay over to the
County Treasurer portions of the several
amounts of money charged In the at
t usatson to have been retained by him.
but that he retained the same openly and
avowedly and under claim of right and
ownership of the same made in good
faith. And the Court further finds and
adjudges that the defendant is not guilty
of the offenses charged in the accusa
tion." v
The decision was read at the end of the
trial by Judge Melvin. and it was con
curred in by Judges Ogden, Kllsworth
and Hall. Following is the language of
the decision:
County Assessor Dalton was acquitted
of malfeasance in office this afternoon by
the jury of judges that was convened to
hear the accusation brought against him
by former County Clerk Crane. The
Judges acquitted Dalton of any intent to
defraud the county out of money due its
treasury.

Arrangements have already been made
for excursions from all of the interior
towns of Alameda County, San Jose,
Stockton, Sacramento, Santa Rosa and
other cities, so that more than one-half
pf the total population of^the State will
be given an opportunity to visit the fair,
faix of the twelve blocks secured will be
devoted to concessions for amusements
and refreshments, and the other six
blocks will be given over to exhibits of
PÂ°Â°ds. It has been three years since
Oakland has had an exhibit of any kiad.
The streets will be inclosed with aboard
fence running along the outer curb, and
as two square blocks of land within this
territory are city property, the park and
the high school property, this can be done
without cutting off any resident from his
home,- and will give a very large space
for concessions and exhibits. It is pro
posed to open the fair on June 14, as the
public schools close on June 13. It will
run far from eight to ten days, as the at
tendance warrants. â¢-â¢ . . . .
The location granted to-night is admira
ble. It includes all of the streets from
Clay to Castro and' from Twelfth to
Ninth. This will give all of the grounds
in the rear of the High School, and with
the beautiful Lafayette square in the cen
ter.
The Elks* street fair was launched to
night, when the City Council. and the
Mayor formally granted Oakland Lodge
of that order the use of, twelve blocks of
streets for the purpose of their fair in
June. From now on the lodge and the com
mittees that have been placed in charge
of the affair will bend their energies to
ward making this the greatest success
that Oakland has attempted in the way
of displays.
The people of Oakland and San Fran
cisco ha\Â»e read about street fairs for sev
eral years, but this is the first opportu
nity that the residents of the bay section
have had to witness such an event.*

PHILADELPHIA, -} April . 21.-The Su
preme Court to-day reversed the decision
of .the Court of Common Pleas in the case
of Napoleon Lajoie vs. the Philadelphia
National League Baseball Club. - This de
cision upholds the validity of the reserve
clause in the National League contracts.
Lajoie, who formerly/played second base
for the National League club i'n this city,
-signed' with- the Philadelphia; 1 American
League Club for the season of 1901 and
1902. -The Philadelphia Baseball Club,
through John I. Rogers, entered suit: to
restrain Lajoie from playing with 'the
American The lower, court held
that the reserve clause , was Illegal and
Rogers carried the case to the Supreme
Court, where , the decision was : reversed.
If this decision stands it will affect all
players who were, subject to the reserve
clause and .who' are : now 3 playing with
the American League. J ) ':Â¦Â¦>]Â¦
The caj;e attracted widespread attention
by the question of the validity: of the "re
serve clause" in National League con
tracts. The. lower court decided that the
National -League contracts ' were lacking
, in mutuality and therefore' oppressive Mo
players who desired to sign other con
tracts. The lower court's decision bore
especially onÂ«the "ten days' release no
tices clause, and. to-day's decision is, in
effect, that this clause is equitable... In
rendering the decision the Supreme Court
says: ." Â¦ ..
Upon a careful consideration â¢ of the I whole
cage we are of opinion' that the provisions ' of
the | contract are. reasonable and that the' con
sideration is fully adequate. "The evidence

The Chief Justice's opinion was very
brief, and consisted entirely of a review
of original cases of the same character
which have been brought to the atten
tion of the court. The two most, im
portant of the cases thus cited. were the
cases, of the State of Louisiana vs. the
State of Texas, concerning the ; quaran
tine, regulation of the latter State, ; in
which leave was given to file, and the
State of Minnesota vs. the Northern' Se
curities Company, in. which the petition
to file was denied.
Referring .' to the latter - case, he said
the petition had been refused because
of the inseparable objection ; that indis
pensable " parties to the case could .not
be brought into the court. This objec
tion did not, however, confront the court
in the present - case, and . the : court felt
that because of its desire to proceed with
the utmost care -and. deliberation in all
"cases where original actions are brought
In this. court the precedent. of. the Louisi
ana-Texas case should be followed rather
than that of . t he Minnesota case ; in ; the
present instance. Hence, - leave â¢ to , - file
should be granted, and subpenas would
be issued, returnable' on the first day 'Of
the next terra of the court, in October. :
The opinion in the case was delivered
by Chief Justice Fuller, who stated that
the court had always exercised the ut
most care in its proceedings In original
cases, and . that I the i present - decision to
grant leave to file . was intended . to be
entirely without prejudice to either party

Several Changes Made in the Postal
OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
In response to an inquiry by McComas,
Frye, in charge of the bill, said that no
appropriation had been made tor dredg
ing the harbor at the Annapolis Training
School, because the aggregate appropria
tion carried by the measure was already
large and the committee was of the opin
ion that Annaaolis could wait.
AVarren of \\ yoming felt that a fair ap
propriation ought to have been carried by
the bill for the construction of dams in
the West for the conservation of water
for irrigation purposes, but he yet had
hope that the House would pass the Irri
gation measure passed by the Senate. In
view of the pendency of that bill, he
woud offer no amendment to the pend
ing measure.
Mitchell of Oregon made a statement of
the proposed improvement of the Colum
bia River, reviewing the work already
done looking to that Improvement. He
said that no more important proposition
was involved in the bill than that relat
ing to this improvement and he urged that
the conference committee should insist
upon the amendment inserted in the
measure by the Senate committee. The
bill was passed without further comment.
As no Senator was prepared to-day to
begin debate on the Philippine Govern
ment bill, the measure, after a few min
utes of informal discussion, went over
until to-morrow morning.
WASHINGTON, April 21.â Without a
word, of discussion of the merits of the
measure, the Senate to-day passed the
river and harbor bill, carrying in appro
priations about $70,000,000. So thoroughly
had the bill been considered by the Com
merce Committee that every Senator was
content that it should pass as reported
from the committee.
Question of Irrigation in the
West Is Left to the
House.
The Senate Appropriates
$70,000,000 for Har
bors and Rivers.

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were higher and
Paris futures lower. The world's shipments
for the week were as follows, in quarters: Rus
sian, 169,000; Argentine, 135.000; Indian, 29.000;
Australian. 6000. The English visible supply
decreased 1,S20,000 bushels and the American
decreased 2,332,000. .
Chicago bobbed about a good deal and was
nervous and unsettled on predicted rain. There
were light showers in â¢ the Ohio Valley and
Illinois, but none anywhere else. All over the
Southwest the weather was cloudy, with tem
peratures ranging from U0 to 100 degrees, with
blgh winds. The trade was Inclined to await
the result of the extensive area of low barom
eter covering .the whole West. The undertone
was firm on fresh reports of serious damage In
the Southwest and considerable export business
in hard winter and Duluth spring. Kansas re
iterated Its previous assertions that It would
not raise over half a crop. The Southwest
were good sellers, however.
In this market futures were slightly lower,
but spot quotations remained unchanged.

CHICAGO, April 21.â Trade in, wheat had a
nervous strain. At the opening there was a
rush toward the weather map and when /only
a few scanty showers were shown to have fall
en since Saturday there was an opening bull
ish sDUrt. Considering the fact that the en
tire wheat belt was dry â even drier than be
fore â the early trade was tame. May opened
%@-%c higher at 75@74*ric Then came pre
dictions that' the hot and unseasonable blasts
In the West would have some small relief by
showers, and selling set in. Gossip had it
also that the Wall-street crowd ,was selling
heavily in order to keep prices down and cre
ate an impression on the stock exchange that
the wheat crop ' was in no danger. May slid
eff to 74V8@f4y lC before the decrease "f
2,H70,000 bushels in . the visible supply came
to the relief of the bulls and started covering
Weather reports ware conflicting and kept the
talent cutfi^inr. Late In the day May had a
rally and closed steady, a shade up, at 74 %@
Corn trade was small and had no prominent
features. The market was Inclined to follow
wheat until near the close, when the market
turned heavy. May close V t @%c lower at
01 %c.
NEW YORK, April 21.â This was another
day of very active and varied speculation in
stocks, but the campaign for the advance re
ceived a rather severe check. The day started
off with indications of a repetition of the suc
cuEsful tactics adopted last week, of heavy
buying at some new points to effset ' realizing
at oihei-8. It fo happened, however, that the
stocks in which realizing was attempted â
namely, the Western and Pacific stocks â were
acutely depressed by the threat of harm to the
crop* and by the leave granted to the State
of Washington to file a suit in the United
Staties Supreme Court against the Northern
teecurltles Company. The leadera of the
campaign for the advance recovered their po-
Mtion to some extent late in the day by a
vigorous buying movement in Kout!.rn Pa
cific up to HUrt. and in Reading and Manhat
tan, which were lifted, respectively, 4% and
3% over Saturday. This induced a general
covering movement In the whole market and
ttarted substantial rallies, which materially
reduced the losses, but still left prices gen
erally below Saturday. The setback came In
the face of promising auspices for the ad
vance. The Louisville incident seemed to
have convinced some of the large Eastern bank
ing Interests that the time was ripe for an
advance, although they had been inclined to
deprecate the movement Inauirurated by West
ern capitalists at premature, on account of
the unformed prospects for the crop. The
Eteamshlp merger was accepted as additional
indication or the confidence Of large capital in
continued prosperous conditions. The results
of the day's operations in the market showed
the Importance of tbe outcome of the crop
situation. Tbe report* of hot winds In the
winter wheat belt did not eeem to affect the
grain market, perhaps owing to the large long
interest in the market, but the simple recital
of the temperatures touched at points In Ne
braska, Missouri and Kansas was sufficient to
caube a reflection of anxiety in the stocks of
the roads running through that region. TKe
weekly statistics of railroad traffic reporting
a decline in the merchandise movement to ihe
Southwest was regarded as corroboration of
the threat of harm to the crops. Scattered
reports of showers may have had something
to do with the late rally In the market. . The
leave granted to the State of Washington to
file fuit against the Northern Securities Com
pany is what was refused to the State of
Minnesota in the previous attempt. The ques
tion of the legality of the company is now
felt to be Â«tart*4 toward a judicial decision.
There ia enough doubt over tne outcome of the
tult to serve a-s an unsettling influence, the
more bo in view of the additional projects now
known to be on foot and dependent upon the
settlement of this questlto.
An incident of the day was the demoraliza
tion an the bilver market, which carried eilver
bullion to BOVrC an ounce, compared with the
jjreviocs low record of 51VÂ«c on September 1.
ltB)7, when Japan adopted the gold standard.
The clump is ta.14 to be due to selling by
China as a necessary incident to the payment
of the indemnity to the powers.
The market closed active and about steady.
The heavy selling of Union Pacific convert
ible bondg was the feature of the bond mar
ket. Total sales. ?6.585.OOO.
United Statex bunds were all unchanged on
the last call.

tember, 1807. The London price yesterday was
23 15-16d, against a lowest record quotation of
23%d in September, 1897. 1 -The causes of the
present drop are dull times In India, the very
small French and Russian" 1 demand, the 'un
settled condition of the Chinese market and the
discontinuance of the Spanish purchases for
coinage, while the large production all over the
world is going along just the same.

One car of Lemons came in and the market
was well supplied with all grades. At the
auction fancy stock sold at $1 50S-1 85.

Butter remained unchanged, with ample
supplies and continued heavy receipts. The
third car was made up for the "East, but it was
thought to be the last for this account, as the
Nev York market made a further decline of
3c. The local demand Is not sufficient to have
absorbed the current heavy receipts, and the
rtcent shipments East have helped things out
materially. . Portland ' continues . to undersell
this market" on the Sound, hence shipments to
that outlet are steadily falling off. Yester
day's steamer took out 7404 pounds.
. There is nothing new in Cheese. Stocks are
heavy and the market is weak.
Eggs remain as previously quoted. \A car â
400 cases â arrived from the East, something
which has not occurred for some little time.
Buying in the country for cold storage is said
to be falling off, and while strictly fine large
ranch are quoted steady, the medium and
lower grades are plentiful 'and weak.
Receipts were 76,300 pounds and 104 tflbs of
Butter, 1670 cases of Eggs, 400 cases Eastern
Eggs, -iS)o0 pounds California Cheese and
pcunds of Eastern Cheese.

Financial agents in London explain that the
fall in the price of silver to the lowest point on
record to-day was caused by the fact that
China, instead of buying silver, as usual at this
time of the year, is selling. In order to pay the
war Indemnity in gold. It is generally believed
that the fall in the price of silver .would not
have occurred had London supported the mar
ket. This, coupled with the fact that the
United States is selling, caused the decline,
which is now believed to have reached the
minimum price.
Siver slumped %d to 23 5-16d per ounce, the
lowest on record in the history of the metal,
the previous record being 23 %d per ounce in
September, 1S97. The present fall is due less
to a selling movement than to a complete ab
sence of a demand. India has been .merely
looking on, and China, Instead of buying, as
usual, this season is selling freely to provide
for the gold war indemnity. The bottom seems
touched provided speculative buying gives an
impetus.
Gold to- the amount of Â£22,000 In bars has
been bought and Â£40,000 has been received
from Holland.
Money rates were strong on the consols' ap
plication. The returns were mopped out by
the debt to the Bank of England. The market
repaid Â£4.000.000 of the Â£5,000.000 due that
institution. . .

and closing at the top. The close was irreg

American stocks were very lively, but dealers
on this side were cautious. They were hanging
on to the coattails of New York, ready to drop
off at any sign of danger. The relapses were
as follows : . Â¦ . Â¦ â¢ Â¦ .
. The stock market was inactive to-day, and
the tone was confident on . the prospects for
peace, which is regarded a^ a foregone conclu
sion. The new consol issue opened weak" on
realizing by those who have obtained their al
lotments. The premium fell to 1%, then rose
to 1% and closed at 1%. The old issue was
finally unchanged at 94%. >

Track Notes.
terday three favorites of the pro
nounced type were laid low and two other
lukewarm ones were tardy in reaching
the wire. The attendance continues ggod
and there appears to be no end of. money
in circulation.
Fourteen ordinary platers faced the
barrier in the opening scramble, and it
wore such an open look that the favor
ite, Senora Caesar, was quoted at 5 to
1. The winner turned up in The Scot,
a 7 to 1 chance, ridden by Donnelly,
Â¦which came strong at the finish, beat
ing Auriffera - nearly two lengths. The
favorite ran a good third.
Amoruna, the diminutive filly from the
Burns & Waterhouse stable, was picked
as one of the soft things of the card.
She closed in the betting a 4 to 5 chance,
and in a long drive Troxler got her up
just in time to beat. Maud bherwood a
nead. The odds â¢ against- Trim dropped
from 12 to 3 on the strength -of a stable
tip. and the St. Gatien fllly finished -
fair third. '. ' : '*.',"'â¢ #
An early plunge on Florinel, one- of.
thirteen starters in the, third sprinting
event,- forced the price from 20 down
to 3 in no time. Donnelly had the mount
on the little gelding, and, passing Mac-
Flecknoe, the favorite, in the stretch,
won at the wire by more than a length
irora Modder. Â¦ This was one of the tew
races on which the books suffered.
' Barney Bchreiber scratched Brutal from
the niile and a sixteenth selling affair,
and Andy Blakeley' s mare Anthracite
was made the medium of a heavy plunge.
An 11 to 10 favorite, she displayed symp
toms of speed, but was not placed at
the finish. r Conley rode a
most energetic ; finish on the .7. to. 1. shot
Fxpedient, downing Plan -nearly -.a
length. Canejo, a 30 to 1 outsider, % ran
The defeat of Meehanus by . Milas In the
seven-furlong selling number 'hit the tal
ent a severe blow;. Caesar."* Young's horse
went into ' the starter's hands a 3 to 2
favorite, and from his many mishaps en
countered during the trip it is' quite ap
parent ' Donnelly does not understand
managing the chestnut. Larry Paly on
Milas rode one of his good races, .get
ing In half- a length - ahead of the first
choice at odds of - 6 to 1. KUty Kelly
Old Wolhurst scored his fifth straight
victory by disposing of a very fair Held
in the . concluding mile .and fifty, yard
selling affair. Conley' had tne leg ' up;
and after getting lostled about at the
start climbed up among the' leaders In
the stretch and led Horton out in a'nerceN
drive. Larry Daly' made altogether too
much early use of the favorite;. Artiila,
vith a result that his mount was not

Judge Cabaniss for violating . the or
dinance prohibiting any bodies from be
ing interred within the confines of the
city and county of San Francisco. The
caBe is a test one, and tho arguments on
apprtil were heard at length by the three
Judges sitting in bank.'
The judgment of the lower^. court was
affirmed and the appeal dismissed. Judge
Cook said there was some doubt as to the
validity of the ordinance, but it was not
sufficient to lead them to declare it void.
Besides, If it had been declared void an
appeal to the Supreme Court would have
been prevented, and both sides are de
sirous of having the constitutionality of
the ordinance tested by the highest court.
The appeal will be- taken at once. <-.â¢ â¢

for the murder of the young girl.
Mrs. Bert Ward, formerly Estelle
Baker, the girl chum of Nora. Fuller, ac
cording to a telegraphic dispatch receive 1 !
last night from Williams, Ariz., where
she now resides, says that there is a re
markable resemblance between the pict
ures published of Charles B. Hadley and
the man whom she saw Nora Fuller with
on several occasions at the Olympia. In
addition to that B. T. Schnell, who sold
the mysterious Hawkins the bedstead and
bedding at Cavanaugh's furniture store
on Mission street, and Edward P. Stengle,
whp waited on the elusive Hawkins at
Noonan's store, state positively that the
picture of Charles B. Hadley, ' with the
false mustache, is an absolute likeness of
the man they dealt with.. On the other
hand, Restaurant-keeper Krone says that
he knows Charles Hadley very well, and
that he is not the man he knew as John
Bennett. He also states that Â¦ Hadley is
not the man Bennett who wore a cler
ical garb some four or five years ago.
Captain Seymour, however, has unearthed
a. splendid photograph of Hadley taken
in a clerical garb, a circumstance to
which he is inclined to attach consider
able importance. Then, again, the soiled
handkerchief with the laundry mark
burned off which Captain Seymour'B de
tectives found in the Sutter street house
is an exact duplicate of the handkerchiefs
Hadley used, one of which is now in Cap
tain Seymour's possession. The police are
satisfied that it. will. be. well worth their
trouble, to go to extremes in their -efforts
to locate the missing accountant. In the
meanwhile they will make a. thorough
search. throughout tine city in an effort
to find somebody who might throw some
light on' Hadley's connection with ' the
case.
Story of a Night 'Watchman.
;v. Ca ES aln , Barkley. night watchman of
the Flood building at Fourth and Market
streets, is convinced that he had a pecu-
vertisement and obtained a card marked "Box
B3S3." I asked the young man behind the
counter to allow me to see the pencil he used.
It was marked "314 Eagle Draughting."
Not wishing to break up my collection of pen
cils, I obtained a pencil from Mr. Dunnlgan, an
Examiner writer, this pencil being of the same
quality as the one used In the business office.
Mr. Dunnlgan . told me that the Examiner
office supplied Its employes with this style of
pencil.
:A microscopic examination proved my claim
correct Please note inclosed photograph
marked with red pencil, showing same quality
of graphite, 'containing very low percentage of
clay. The other part of the ad., including the
erasures. Is written with a medium soft pencil.
On March. 23 Captain Seymour sent a police
officer to me with Instructions that the Exam
iner ad must be Instantly returned to the Ex
aminer office, as they insisted on having the
original immediately. A few days afterward
wishing to show the captain the existence of
two kinds of pencils us^d in the body of the
original Examiner ad, I called by order of
the captain, on Mr. Roberts' for same, - and
was refused, because . I had no written order
from the captain. A few days subsequently I
again went to Mr. . Roberts with a written
order, from Captain Seymour and was again
refused. â¢ - -. Â¦

BURIAL CASE
OPINION GIVEN
This sensational document was placed
in Chief Wittman's hands yesterday, and
lie immediately placed it in the hands of
Captain Seymour, -who is leaving no stone
unturned to unravel the mystery. In ad
dition to this positive statement of Ex
pert Kytka there are several circum
stances which probably might prove dam

mysterious murder of Nora Ful
ler. Both Captain Seymour and Chief
Wittman are anxious to locate the miss
ing man, who left a lucrative position as
bookkeeper and accountant of the Exam
iner and suddenly disappeared on the day
the story of the finding of Nora Fuller's
body was published in the newspapers.
Neither Chief Wittman nor Captain Sey
mour will say positively that Hadley
strangled the young girl in the vacant
house on Sutter street, but they do say
that they are more anxious to locate Had
ley than any other suspect that has been
talked of since the nude body of the
unfortunate girl was found by the po
lice. Theodore Kytka, the famous hand
writing expert, submitted an additional
report to Chief Wittman yesterday, in
which he declares positively that the man
who wrote the decoy advertisement that
was published In the Chronicle and Ex
aminer, and which was the means of
luring Nora Fuller to her horrifying
death, and the man who signed the con
tract with Umbsen & Co. for the house
at 2211 Sutter street, where the girl was
subsequently murdered, was Charles B.
Hadley of the Examiner.

The trial of Walter Dlmmfck, ex-chief
clerk of the Mint, on a charge of stealing
$30.0(iO in gold coin from the cashier's
vault of the Government coin depository,
was resumed yesterday in the United
States District Court before Judge- de
Haven and a jury.
Dimmick was recalled for direct exam
ination by Attorney Collins and the de-
Icnoant endeavored to cast the responsi
bility for the robbery upon Cashier Cole:
Dimmick made vigorous denial of the
facts testified to by witnesses, and claim
ed that they had all perjured themselves.
When Attorney Bert Schlesinger cro&s
examined Dimmick for the Government,
the defendant made certain statements
that will allow the introduction of impori
am evidence In rebuttal.
In his direct examination, Dimmick said
that he had never tampered with '.he
locks of the cashier's vault or any other
locks in the Mint. He claimed that cer
tain shortages had existed in Cashier
Cole's accounts on many occasions, and
that Cole had made good the missing sam
of $120. The defendant then told of over
feges in November, 1899, amounting to $400,
iiTiti that the sum was taken from the
vaults by order of Superintendant Leach.
The money was deposited by Leach for
unknown parties, and Dimmick claimed
that Cole had deducted $120 from the sum
in order to reimburse himself for his first
shortage. :
Seeks to Accuse Cole. -
Dimmick then claimed that many other
shortages had occurred in Cole's cash ac
counts and that the cashier had - taken
money from the vault and made up the
suri: in the cajsh trays.
"On one occasion,'.' said Dimmick, "a
truck loaded with sacks of gold contain
ing $3000 each was taken out of the office
and Cole rushed to the truck and took off
one of the sacks, exclaiming with an
oath, "By , I had a narrow escape
that time.' " â¢ , .
The next phase of the examination was
as to the reason why Dimmick had been
found in the Mint on several occasions
ts late as midnight.
He said it was a part of his duty as
chief clerk to check the pay roll and he
was unable to do this work until after 6
p. m. At Mr. Leach's request he worked
two or three hours a night for about eight
raorths, from October, 1900. on the re
finery report for the whole of Mr. Leach's
itrm as superintendent. He was never
at the Mint on business other than that
connected with his official duties.
Wanted to Change Positions.
The only occasion in which Dimmick
spoke to Cole about changing their posi
tions was once when Cole complained that
Dimmick had kept him waiting fifteen
minutes and when Dimmick said: *'If you j
think the chief clerk hasn't auything to t
do you'd better change places with me !
and nnd out."
Air. Collins produced a yellow box about
twelve by eighteen inches and several
large account books. These were iden
tified by Dimmick as being the articles
that he took out with him from the Mint
in the nighttime. He carried out the
books in ine box, and also had a small
hand satchel, in which he took the family
silverware to and from his residence. He
used to keep his silverware for safekeep
ing in the Mint vaults. He denied that
lie -ever owned a. dress suit case or that
he ever purchased anything at Summer
field & Roman's, or that he knew a Mrs.
Perry on McAllister street, or had ever
been in a house on that street. On sev
eral occasions the defendant took out of
the Mint several empty linen bags in
which Australian gold had been stored.
He look them home to make dishrags out
of them and for other purposes, and Su
perintendent Leach used to take them
out also.
The foregoing testimony was given for
the purpose of negativing the testimony
of Cyrus P. Ellis that he saw Dimmick at
about midnight on one occasion leaving
the Mint with two or three sacks of gol<i
in his hands, and the testimony of the
street car men as to his traveling with a
dress suit case. He denied also that he
ever had had any words with a street
car conductor.
Is Rigidly Cross-Examined.
Dimmick denied that he had ever agreed
to make restitution of any portion of the
stolen money, and said that Secret Ser-'
vice Agent Burns and District Attorney
Woodwortb wanted him to do so, but that
he refused for the reason that he was
not the man who stole the money.
On cross-examination by Attorney
Schlesinger. Dimmick admitted that the
books he carried from the Mint on the
night of March 18, 1901, were old accounts
of. his prexious business. He claimed
that he worked on the posting, of the ac
counts, though the last entry made was
on December 30. 1900. ..
Dimmick admitted that he went out of
business in 1838 and that he finished his
work on his accounts in 1301. The de
fendant claimed that he had often worked
in the Mint late at night, assisted by
some of the clerks, but he could not men
tion any dates.
. Dimmick then detailed the method of
counting the coin every day in the vaults
and told the familiar story of the discov
ery of empty holes in the racks of the
vault where gold sacks should have been
The defendant then stated that he had
â¢ften oiled the locks in the Mint, but
could not give exact dates.
Changed Clothes at Mint.
Dimmick further admitted that â¢ when
he became cashier of the- Mint he was
instructed in the work of changing the
lock combination by a locksmith, and not
by the former cashier. When Cole became
cashier Dimmick was the man who as
msted him to change the lock combina
tion, and by standing behind the door was
able to learn Cole's combination.
Dimmick was then asked if he ever car
ried a. dress suit to the Mint, and admit
ted that he had done bo, but that the suit
was wrapped up in paper. He claimed
that the witnesses who had testified that
rre had carried a dress suit case Into the
