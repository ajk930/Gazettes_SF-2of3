' The party left New York on Saturday.
May 31, and on arriving at Cincinnati
was royally entertained by Syrian Tem

West it was found necessary to divide the
train into two. sections. Imperial Poten
tate Shaffer going with the second sec
tion. This section was delayed several
hours at Minton, Colo., because of a
wreck, and this caused the section to
reach this city several hours after the
first. Both parties were well entertained
en route. At Denver the Nobles were en
tertained by El Jebel Temple, and Pikes
Peak and other points of Interest were
visited. At Salt Lake City the members

visitors, a breakfast and coach ride about
the city. The delegation expressed itself
as being heartily pleased with its journey
across the continent.

rived shortly after 8 o'clock with Mr3.
Shaffer and party. They were accorded a

SACRAMENTO, June 8.â Appeals -are

abolish the local High School fraternities,
and considerable feeling has been aroused
on both sides. The first fraternity was
introduced in Sacramento about four
years ago by J. H. Pond, then priclpal of
the local High School but now principal
of the High School at Oakland. Since
then the idea has grown and the fraterni
ties have become powerful in numbers,

Mob Gathers for Lynching.
HARRIMAN, Term., j June 8.â The Â¦ wife
of John Bailey, a farmer, was found dead
at her home to-day. George Robert, aged
14, a colored servant, Is suspected, and to
night a' crowd has gathered, bent upon
lynching Â« him. ;
A few of the Boer women .still Inveigh
against surrender, but the , general â¢ feel
ing among them is in favor of making the
best of the situation. ,
Among the men who surrendered to the
British authorities at Balmoral, Cape
Colony, were four Americans, who will
be granted free passage to Delagoa Bay.
â¢ A strange sign' of the altered conditions
In South Africa is that Lord Mllner, the
British . liigh Commissioner, . rode . from
Pretoria to Johannesburg last Saturday
accompanied only by two staff officers.
In many such Instances thi Boers have
cheered King Edward, and they â¢ have
Bometimes expressed surprise that no
army "was sent out to receive their sur
renders. The Boers are allowed to re
tain their horses and saddles. . The ma
jority of them appear to" be glad that the
war is at an end and that they will now
to be able to rejoin their families.
The Boer leader goes out to meet a
commando and returns at its head. The
Boers who come In are generally dressed
in dilapidated clothing, but have a smart
and soldierly bearing. Those who are to
surrender are assembled and the Boer
leader delivers an address to his men,
urging them to listen to the British offi
cer who has been detailed on this work.
The I British officer then makes a speech
to the men of the commando, in which he
informs them, of the admiration of King
Edward and the British nation for the
gallant struggle and the bravery of their
people and promises that the British au
thorities will do their utmost to help them
resettle on their farms. A meal is then
provided for the Boers, after which" the
formal surrenders occur.
Dispatches received from Pretoria con
firm the statements made in Lord Kitch
ener's communication to the War Office
and say that the whole staff of the late
Transvaal Government, with a bodyguard
of fifty men, surrendered last Saturday.
The following formalities are observed
when General ' Botlm., General Dewet or
any of the Boer commandants accompany
the British officer who, has been detailed
to receive surrenders:
Tbe disarmament of the Boers is proceeding
satisfactorily and good spirit is displayed ev
erywhere. Yesterday 4312 rifles had been sur
rendered up to date.
LONDON, June 8.â In a letter from
Pretoria, dated May 18, the correspondent
of the Daily Mail says that the previous
day (Thursday) sixty arrests were made
there as the result of- the discovery of an
extensive plot to blow up the Government
buildings and Lord Kitchener's residence
and to spike the guns in the artillery bar
racks. The. parties concerned in the plot,
according to the correspondent, were law
yers, chemists and Boer and Dutch pris
oners on parole.
The War Office has received the., fol
lowing message from Lord Kitchener un
der to-day's date:
Ante-Peace Conspiracy.
Many Arrests in Connection With an
PLOT AGAINST KITCHENER.
The document is signed by Schalk-Bur
ger, formerly Acting Vice-President of
the Transvaal, and General Louis Botha.
Lord Kitchener then mounted a dais and
called for three cheers for King Edward.
The response of everybody assembled In
the square was immediate and unre
strained. The open letter of the Boer lead
ers to the burghers, in which peace Is
announced, and in which, these burghers
are counseled to loyal acquiescence, is an
eloquent and pathetic document. In it the
leaders thank the burghers for their noble
sacrifice and express their sympathy for
the bereaved. The letter concludes: -â¢
Â¦Now that there Is peÂ«ce. and although lt r is
not a peace, such as we longed . for, yet let
us abide where God has led us. We can with
clear consciences declare that for two years
and a half our people have carried on. the
struggle in a manner 'almost, unknown to'his
tory. Let us now grasp, each other's hand,
for another great struggle- lies before us, a
struggle for tbe spiritual and racial prosperity
and welfare of our people. Casting aside all
feelings of bitterness, let us forget and for
give bo that the deep wounds caused by this
war may be healed.
PRETORIA, June 8.â The services of
thanksgiving for the return of peace, to
day, was held in the principal square of
Pretoria. The sun shone brilliantly and
the sight was most impressive. . Outside
of the roped inclosure of Â¦ troops were
gathered many thousands of -the towns
people and a goodly sprinkling of "Boers,
whose demeanor was most respectful.
The Archbishop of Cape Town officiated
at the service, and Lord Kitchener, Gen
eral Baden-Powell and Lady â¢ Methuen,
wife of General Methuen, and other prom
inent perspns were present. The massed
bands of various regiments supplied the
music and the troops and people Joined
in singing the hymns, with . wonderful
effect. The singing of "God Save . the
King" and Rudyard Kipling's "Reces

DAVY, w. Va., June 8.â There has been
no serious trouble here, but the operators
announce that to-morrow morning they
will operate their mines with non-union
labor. The strikers say that non-union
men shall not enter the mines. The op

SHAMOKIN, Pa., June 8.â The homes of

early this morning and effigies of the trio

police to-day and last night destroyed a
number of effigies that had been hung
around town.
FORT DE FRANCE, Martinique^Satur
day, June 7.â The damage from the erup

WASHINGTON June 8. â Professor
Robert T. Hill, of th* Geological Survey,
who was one of the scientists on the ex
pedition of investigation sent out by this
Government after the Martinique disas
ter, arrived in this city to-day from New
York. Professor Hill said:
The Dixie expedition was a great success It
was organized In less than four days witn a
complete equipment. .
â¢ The endeavor which the Un'ted States made
to relieve the distress and the large representa
tion of naval vessels and newspaper men has
made a deep impression upon the people or the
island to whom we were a constant marvel ana
source of astonishment. The negroes of Mar
tinique were laboring under a misapprehension
that American enterprise was going to re
build St. Pierre and when told that it was on
French territory, they could not understand
why a little matter of International complica
tion should be permitted to Interfere In the
Too much cannot be said of the enterprise
and labor of United States Consul Ayme, who
rushed to the scene of action from his sta
tion at Guadeloupe with hardly a change or
clothing and a few shillings in his pocket, and
then Intelligently did everything In his power
to assist the people of the island and the
American relief party. It is feared that his
health, which was already precarious. Is se
riously shattered by his labors-
The only criticisms that could bÂ» made con
cerning the outcome of the expedition would
be as to the manner in which the relief was
distributed on the island. Notwithstanding the
reports to the contrary, there was much dis
tress on Martinique and had our supplies been
distributed with the same generosity by the
local officers as that with which they were
given, much more good would have been done.
The Governor and many of the prominent isl
and officials having been killed by the disaster,
the slowness of the relief was no , doubt due
to the disorganized condition of affairs. The
few patients in the local hosDitals who should
have been the chief beneficiaries of our chari
ties which contained every possible article for
the relief of the sick and clothing enough to
have clad the population of the island, did
not receive a single article which we carried.
And the two sailors from the Roraima, whom
we brought back with ue, came up on the
Dixie almost naked and were supplied with
clothes from the sailors* "lucky bag."
The supplies brought by the Dixie were sim
ply stored In the warehouses. Many people on
the Island are without shelter, while the tents
we carried remain unpacked. And when we
left but little of the relief was reaching the
interior of the country, where it was most
needed. â¢ '
Special cable to The Call and the New York

LONDON, June 8. â A most remarkable
claim, the genuineness of which It Is &3
yet. impossible to test, says a cable dis
patch published by the Daily Mail from
its Las Palmas correspondent, has been
i made by Senor Clemente Figueras, an en
gineer of woods and forests in the Canary
Islands, for many years professor of
physics at St. Augustine'3 College, at Las
Palmas. - '. ; : - ..
It seems that for years he has been
working silently at a method of di
rectly utilizing atmospheric electricityâ
that is to say, without chemicals or dy
namosâand making a practical applica
tion of it without the need of employing
any motive force. A true revelation
might rob him of his reward, and even
now, while he claims to have succeeded,
he is silent concerning the exact princi
ples of his discovery. He asserts, how
ever, that he has invented a generator by
which he can collect electric fluid so as to
bo able to store it and apply It for Infinite
purposes, for instance, in connection, with
ships, railways and manufactures. He
srys he expects its effect will be a tre
mendous economic and industrial revolu
tion. He will not give a key to the in
vention, but declares that the only extra
ordinary point about it is that it ba3
taken so long to discover a simple scien
tific fact.
Senor Figueras intends shortly going to
Madrid and Berlin to patent his inven
tions.
In addition to the discovery the Daily
Mail says that, according to letters re
ceived in London from his friend3 in Tcn
erifte, Senor Figueras has constructed a
rough apparatus by which, in spite of it3
small size and defects, he obtains a cur
rent of 550 volts, which he utilizes in his '
own house for lighting purposes and driv
ing a motor of twenty horsepower. His
inventions comprise a generator, a motor
and a sort of governor or regulator, th9
whole apparatus being so simple that a

said 100 will be here by the middle of
next week. The operators also claim that
they will enforce their order that ail
strikers shall vacate company houses.
The strikers say they will not move out,
and serious trouble is expected, probably
to-morrow. Men will be brought here to

also to enforce the orders for the strikers
to vacate the company houses.

ST. PAUL, Minn., June 8.â A fight with
pistols and shotguns late to-day between
three citizens and about thirty Italians
employed in a camp on the Chicago Great
Western Railroad at the end of the Con
cord street car line resulted in the serious
injury of four men, one of whom will die.
A. Roberge was shot In the abdomen

wounds on his face, and it is thought that
he will lose his eyesight,
Mr. and Mrs. Roberge, Mr. and lira.
Marcotte and Wayman were passing the
camp after a fishing trip, when the Ital
ians made disrespectful remarks about
the women. Roberge and Marcotte re
torted. A pistol shot was fired and waa
immediately followed by several others.
The Italians hid behind trees and camp
buildings and from their position of van
tage began a fusillade of shots. None of
the shots took effect and the shooting
ceased for a while. Finally some of the
laborers ran into the camp building, from
where one of them fired three shots from
a shotgun. Each shot brought down a
man, Roberge, Marcotte and Wayman
falling In the street. The police arrested
twenty of the Italians. It Is not clear
which side began the shooting.

stream In a small boat to Eagle City.
â¢When the messenger left the town was
submerged under four feet of -water in
places. The river was running like a mlll T
race and still rising.
The manager of the Northern Commer
cial Company at Dawson has started for
Circle City to inspect the damage and
furnish new stock if needed.
Though Circle City was one of the first
trading posts established on the Yukon,
this Is the first time it has ever been
flooded. The flood was caused by ice jama
below the town and the consequent back

The King and Queen entered the cathe
dral to the accompaniment of the hymn
"Onward, Christian Soldier," by the
choir and the throng of worshipers
arose and heartily Joined in the singing.
The cathedral organ .was re-enforced
with uorns and other instruments. A
notable feature of the musical service
was the rendition of a "Te Deum," com
posed by the late Sir Arthur Sullivan for
a thanksgiving peace service.
Following the thanksgiving collects,
and at the request of King Edward, the
hymn, "O, God Our Help in Ages Past,"
was sung to the tune of "Old Hundred."
Tbe sermon by the Bishop of Stepney
was short and simple and was preached
on the effective text, '"The blessings of
peace." The service was concluded with
the singing of the national anthem.
The members of the royal family re
turned from the cathedral to Buckingham
Palace by way of the Victoria Embank
ment. King Edward and the other royal
personages received ovations all along
the route from the crowds, which had by
this time become greatly au,gmented.
SERVICES UT CHURCH.
King Edward and Queen Alexandra
alighted at the west entrance of St.
Paul's. Here they were received by the
Bishops of Stepney and London and con
ducted by them to their seats, which
were under the dome of the building and
directly in front of the pulpit.
The seats in the choir stalls were oc
cupied by the members of the present
Cabinet and by member* of former Cabi
nets. These gentlemen, in their dark
clothes, formed a somber group in the
great gathering in which the uniforms of
officials, the costumes of ladies and white
surplices were conspicuous features.
Members of the House of Lords and
members of the House of Commons were
seated on opposite sides, under the dome.
la addition to the presence of many
army and navy officials, the military
prowess of the empire was represented
by detachments of tbe Royal Fusileers,
the Horse and Foot Guards and other
regiments.
"Thank you, very much."
The streets leading to St. Paul's
Cathedral were densely crowded and a
number of persons fainted In the crush
outside the barriers which had been erect
ed within the cathedral.
The royal personages were driven down
the. Mall to Trafalgar Square, and
through the Strand and Fleet street. At
Temple Bar officials of the city of Lon
don, for the first time since tho jubilee
of the late Queen Victoria, awaited the
sovereign in state. The King's carriage
was stopped when it reached the city of
ficials and the Lord Moyor of London, Sir
Joseph C. Dimsdale, presented the svord
of the city to the King and uttered a for
mal welcome. The King returned the
sword, smiled, bowed and simply re
marked:
CITY'S SWORD PRESENTED.
The programme of this morning was not
intended to be accompanied by special
ostentation. King Edward and Queen
Alexandra did not pass through the
streets even in semi-state, but rode to
St. Paul's in an ordinary landau drawn
Â¦lay four horses, accompanied by postil
lions and outriders clad in scarlet tunics.
Only those members of the royal family
who reside in Buckingham Palace ac
companied the King and Queen. The
Prince and Princess of Wales and others
proceeded to St. Paul's separately, but
by the same route as did King Edward
iuiu Queen Alexandra. The King and
tjueen were joined at the cathedral by
the Prince and Princess of Wales and
many other distinguished personages.
: Although the weather was chilly, the
streets for the entire distance from the
palace to the cathedral were lined thick
ly with people wih bared heads. King
Edward, who wore the uniform of a field
marshal, was greeted with enthusiasm
iind the King, the Prince of Wales and
the other Princes were busily engaged in
acknowledging salutations from the
crowd. Lord Roberts, who drove with
his wife and daughters, was one of- the
figures most conspicuously greeted with
"cheers.
The thanksgiving services held In Lon
don to-day were typical of the cervices
held throughout the empire, but the pres
ence of King Edward and other mem
bers of the royal family at the principal
devotional service in London and . the
progress of the royal personage to and
from St. Paul's Cathedral, through cheer
ing thousands of British subjects and vis
itors in London, gave Thanksgiving day
in the metropolis the added feature of a
notable historic occasion.
LONDON. June 7.â The noisy jubilation
with which London has resounded for the
last week was succeeded to-day by more
subdued, although not less impressive,
public demonstrations of thankfulness for
the return of peace in South Africa.
Rabbi Kaplan's strong attack on the
fraternities has proved a sensation, but
thus far the members of the fraternities
have declined to say a word. It is as
serted, however, that they intend to insist
on their rights to maintain their organi
zations and that they will resort to the
courts if necessary to test the question of
those rights.
The rabbi asserted that the working
classes, and not the aristocracy, were the
pride and glory of the nation, and any
body who.exoludes a child of a working
man is a menace to American freedom
and would rather see a king in the White
House, than the son of a poor man, like
Lincoln. ,
To exclude an American child from some so
ciety under the shadow of our public schools
because that child is of humble station of life
Is an ineult to the. American flag and the
American constitution. Abraham Lincoln, if
he had been a pupil In our schools of Sacra
mento to-day, would have been excluded from
these societies on account of poverty. Jesus
would have been excluded on account of hi"
father "having been a carpenter. And so some
of the noblest men and women in history, lit
erature and philanthropy might have been ex
cluded from the, aristocratic societies in our
schools. * â¢
But now come along these miserable societies,
and like Â¦ oestif erpus worms are trying to eat
away the sweet roots of the American tree
of equality and national fraternity. Unless
these societies be nipped in the bud they will
in time Infect the national life and undermine
the American institutions of pure democracy.

labor leaders detailed here from various
parts of the coal field having gone home
to spend Sunday. . Although President
Mitchell is leading a great struggle for a

self to any prescribed hours of labor. He
works late every night and he was busy
all of to-day in his office: Most of his
time was given up to receiving reports by
messenger or by wire from his men in the
field. His information, he said, was of a
satisfactory nature.
Among the reports sent in were several
to the effect that additional engineers
had stopped work last night, and that
several lire bosses, who had taken the
places of strikers, had quit. At a meet
ing of engineers at Pittston last night
thirty engineers who had not obeyed tho
strike order decided not to go to work to
morrow. The few union men who are
still at work, Mr. Mitchell says, will be
out during the week. /
Most of the general superintendents of
the big coal companies had nothing to

hard for competent men to run their en

The coal companies have been favored
by a long spell of dry. weather, and the
strikers are wishing for a heavy fall of

most of the lower levels of the mines are

BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
f N.^VV., WASHINGTON, June 8.
8 âPresident Roosevelt is still
H carefully watching the coal
V - A strike. That official Washington
will take some recognition of
the situation now seems certain.
It is not impossible that a case may in
some form go up to the Attorney Gen
eral, as there is already ample evidence
taken by the officials of the Government
to show that a combination of roads
handling anthracite coal exists for the
purpose of controlling the price and out-
Jut. That this combination, formed and
operating in violation oi the Sherman
anti-trust law and the interstate com
merce law. is in a measure, responsible
for the present strike there is. no doubt
and it is in this connection that some
official action may be taken tending
toward forcing a settlement. n - artt +n
It becomes more and , more apparent to
the President and his advisers that _the
underlying, causes of the present -far-,
reaching difficulty are not immediate, but
go back to the combination of coal min
ing railroads. Such a combination was Â¦<
found to exist by both the committee of
Congress, as far back as 1892. and by
the Industrial Commission in later years.
It was the conclusion of the Congressional
committee that the railroad companies
were parties to the combine to control the
output and to fix the prices of hard coal,
and that, moreover, the combination em
braced all roads connecting the anthra
cite coal fields with tide water. JTbe rIn
dustrial Commission followed th s y th ,
a thorough examination of the entire Bub
ject of railroad consolidation. '-*..â
That such a combination, harmful in its
effects on the consumer, has also brought
about . the situation leading up to the
present strike is now beginning to dawn
on the Government officiate, and it may
not be found impossible to reach the oper
ators through the Department of Justice
for violations of the common law m gen
eral, and the coal roads in particular.
The President to-day talked with Car
roll D. Wright, United States Commis
sioner of Labor, for some time regarding
the situation in the anthracite coal re
gion.- Mr. Wright came to Washington
at the reauest of the. President, who
wished to get his views on the question
and to discuss what might be done under
the law giving the Commissioner of
Labor the right to investigate affairs of
this kind and to collect information re
lating to them which may be reported to
the President or to Congress. Late in the
day Mr. Wright left Washington for New

the chief. Early In the day Lieutenant

equerries assigned by King Edward to
the special embassy, called informally up
on Reid to pay their respects. The equer
ries placed their services at. his disposal
and conveyed to him their congratulations

were particularly pleasing, as officially the

Shares of the Hamburg- American â¢ and
North German Lloyd steamship lines de
clined rather sharply from the high fig
ures thex reached the previous -week,
through rumors of the organization of an

sold large blocks of stock here yesterday.
The prices obtained were but little better
as a result of the denial that the combine
in question was in process of organization.
The German Atlantic Cable -Company
has declared a dividend of 4% per cent.'
The company has decided to issue 20,000,

Imperial and Prussian 3 per cents had
a strong week. The shares of domestic
banks were more active than usual. Can
adian Pacifies were weaker, in response
to the crop reports. The American situa
tion generally causes renewed concern,
particularly as a result of rumors of dis
agreements in the management of the
United States Steel Corporation.
Comparing last week's prices with the'
lowest which the year has seen, however,
there Is still a substantial advance. The
recoveries in round numbers are as fol
lows: Consols,- 3%; colonials, 3 to '4%;
high-class home rails, 10 to 22; foreign
bonds, from 3 to 4; cheaper, issues up to
11; Argentines, 13. Japanese 4 per cent

higher last week.

The market owes the Bank of England
more than Â£3,000,000, but the bank is de
veloping a stronger position; It probably
will get the whole of the Â£1,500,000 gold

output and the prospect of heavier gold
shipments from Australia tend to increase
the supply. of cash. The effect will not
be marked until' late in the year, when the
earliest advantage will be taken to bring
out a new Transvaal loan. In the mean
while a large contingent of weak ; bulls
remain to be shaken out and after this
is done there probably will be a resump

BERLIN, June 8.â Last week on the

Sooner or later a man must be free; sooner
or later he takes charge of his own conscience,
and a university Is one of the best places for
this. I say this because an impression abounds
that a university is a place of terrible tempta
tions. Mothers sometimes think It is difficult
for a man to acquire an education except at
great risk, and men speak about the tempta
tions of college life as if there were no tempta
tions in business, as if the banker and broker
lived in a holier atmosphere, as if the apostles
of "Wall -street were in closer touch with the
Ten Commandments than other men. I know
of no place where a man may be trusted to
work out the best In him so well as In a mod
ern university. If you have been faithful to
the early training you have' received, it has
been helped by coming here.

ander H&U. Mrs. Cleveland and Mrs.-
Patton were In the audience. In his ser
mon Dr. Patton said:
Any American who has traveled in France
and has witnessed the thrift and order of
those smaller communities where agriculture
is profitably practiced must welcome the appli
cation to our soil of those methods which have
made the successful farmer abroad. Â»
William E. Dodge said:
If those who are friends of practical educa
tion and of general social betterment could
realize as we do the great needs and greater
opportunities of this school I believe that we
would have little difficulty in obtaining that
generous financial support that at this timo
seems necessary to Insure the establishment
of this Institution upon a basis commensurate
with the extent and importance of the work
It has to do.
Vice President Hewitt said:
Aeide from my official connections with the
school I have taken a deep Interest in its
progress. We demonstrated, I think, beyond a
doubt, that there Is need and opportunity for
a practical farming school in this country on
the plan carried out by our director, Powell.
Our need now is money resources - for the
equipment of the foundation of a school at
Poughkeepsle, and when this equipment is
completed we will need contributions to a fund
for the endowment of the school. -
The success of the school was immedi
ate and the originators then concluded to
extend the facilities. The board of trus
tees was then organized, with the follow
ing officers: Theodore L. Norden, presi
dent; Abraham S. Hewitt and William E
Dodge, vice presidents; R. Fulton Cut
ting, treasurer, and T. P. Luquer, secre
tary.*
In speaking of the school President Van
Norden said to-day:
. NEW YORK, June 8.â The signing of
contracts within a few days for the pur
chase of the School of Practical Agricul
ture of forty 7 five acres of lands near
Poughkeepsle marks the beginning of a
movement for the permanent establish
ment near New York of what the promo
ters call one of the most unique educa
tional institutions In the country. Less
than two years ago a number of citizens
prominent In political and social life met
at the residences of Abraham S. Hewitt
and R. Fulton Cutting and formed them
selves into an organization for establish
ing, experimentally, a school where the
practice as well as the theory of farming
could be taught. Professor George T.
Powell, a recognized authority on scien
tific agriculture, undertook the organiza
tion of the school and a number of per
sons agreed to finance the project in Its
experimental stages. The original com
mittee of promotion, of which Hewitt was
chairman, included R. Fulton Cutting, Ja
cob S. Schiff, John G. Carlisle, Mrs. Seth
Low, Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell. Walter
W. Law and William E. Dodge. The
original school establishment was at
Briar Cliff manor, provided by the gen
erosity of Law, who also furnished a
building to accommodate the thirty-five
students and the necessary staff.

PRESIDENT OF ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS AND TWO MEM
BERS OF ASSOCIATION WHO ARE ARRANGING FOR ANNUAL, RE
UNION AND PICNIC TO BE HELD AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
Prominent members of the Republican
I iir'y are watching the turn of events
with intense interest. The relations be
tween the President and Senator Hanna
f-inee the former came to the White House
have been cordial at all times. The Sen
ator has supported the President in many
measures in Congress when other lead
ers, who were supposed to be friendly,
had deserted him. The two have been
often in consultation on public and party
policy and Mr. Roosevelt has repeatedly
depended on Mr. Hanna's Judgment and
frequently sought his advice. Should a
breach in these relations come it would
be a matter of the greatest regret to
Republicans in all parts of the country
and every effort will be made by Intimate
personal friends of both men to pre
vent it. <
Senator Hanna is determined to stand
by his officeholding friends. Should the
investigation go on too fiercely it doubt
less will have a tendency to anger Senator
Hanna and the threatened break will fol
low. Collector Leach's term exDires in
August and should enough be found to
j ire vent his retention by the President the
'. ro.ik would then probably become irre
/o-cilable.
In view of Mr. Burton's retirement it
is possible that Mr. Abel will resign as
chairman of the executive committee. If
this is done the affair may be smoothed
uver so far as the Representative is con
cerned. If it is not done the Foraker
faction will run Mr. Abel for United
States Senator against Mr. Hanna and the
bitter factional fight In Ohio will only
be increased.
The conference lasted an hour and broke
up with the President resolved to begin
an investigation in spite of the wishes of
Senator Hanna. Civil Service Commis
sioner James R. Garfield will go to Cleve
land this week, and although no instruc
tions are announced it ts presumed that
he will inquire into the charges.
PRESIDENT TAKES ACTION.
These four officials, it is alleged, re
cently fixed up a slate for the organiza
tion of the Republican executive commit
tee in the county of Cuyahoga, Ohio. Rep
resentative Burton claimed the right to
dictate the choice of the chairman of tWs
committee, as it was entirely in his dis
trict, and named Paul Kowland for the
place. His candidate, however, was de
featedj and W. R. Abel was chosen by a
vote of SS to 26, thus showing Hanna's
strength in the county.
Representative Burton, who. It should
he said, has no quarrel with Senator Han
na, on learning that his wishes had been
ignored and his man turned down imme
diately announced that he would not
stand for a renomination, and proceeded
yesterday to the White House to lay a
complaint before the President against
the four Federal officials. He charged
them with undue activity in politics and
â¢with violation of the recent executive or
der, and called upon President Roosevelt
for an investigation.
The President was very much surprised
and Impressed by the formal charges, but
promised no action at the time. He at
once sect for Senator Hanna and asked
him if the four men were guilty. Senator
Hanna said he had grave doubts about it,
though he did not pretend to speak for
Mr. Burton's appointee. The President In
formed Senator Hanna that he was in
clined to investigate and the Senator
urged him strongly not to do so, insist
ing that it was not a violation for Fed
eral officeholders of that class to interest
themselves in politics. Â¦ /
OFFICIALS TOO ACTIVE.
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 8.â A sensation
al rupture in the cordial relations existing
between President Roosevelt and Senator
Hanna is possible as the result of charges
filed against Federal officeholders in
Cleveland. Ohio, by Representative But
ton of that district. The President is de
termined to investigate. Senator Hanua
is determinedly opposed to such a course.
Friends of both men say a serious break
is threatened. Should it come it would
be the most spectacular _and disastrous
breach between a President and the chair
man of the national committee of a ruling
party that has occurred since the falling
out of President Harrison and Senator
Quay, who managed the campaign in
which Harrison was elected.
The retirement of Representative Bur
ton from the Congressional fight in Cleve
land is only an incident. Mr. Burton is
looked upon by the party managers as
one of the ablest men In the House. He
is chairman of the River and Harbor
Committee and a safe and sound counsel
lor in national party affairs. He is con
cerned in the threatened rupture between
the President and Senator Hanna because
he brought personally to the attention of
the President charges of pernicious activ
ity on the part of Federal officials in
Cleveland. These officers are Charles F.
Leach, Collector of Customs; Frank M.
Chandler, United States Marshal, and W.
R. Kotkins, deputy United States Mar
shal, all of whom are Hanna men and
were appointed at his suggestion. One
other officer involved is C. C. Dewstoe,
Postmaster in Cleveland, who was ap
pointed at Mr. Burton's suggestion.

Renchart relates a startling and stirring
account of the treasures. According to
this story there came to Mexico immedi
ately after the close of the Civil War in
the United States five unreconstructed
Confederates who were in search of adven
ture. They led wild lives and in a short
time became bandits in the full sense of
that word. They had their rendezvous in
a cave on Saddle Mountain, near Mon
terey. In one of their raids they attacked
a pack train from the Plna Alta mines
laden with gold bullion. They killed and
drove off the armed guards and secured
the treasure, valued at $600,000, and started
for Monterey, where they hoped to turn it
into cash; They were closely pursued by
a detachment of Federal troqps and Ui Or
der to make their escape, they were forced
to bury the gold at a spot within five
miles of Monterey. They made a plat of
the place and carefully marked its exact
location. Four of the members of this
desperate band of American brigands
were overtaken before they could seek re
fuge in Monterey and were killed. The
fifth member escaped for the time being,
but was arrested in Monterey two days
later on another charge and was taken to
the City of Mexico, where he served a
long term in prison and was deported,
leaving the country by way of Vera Cruz.
He landed in New Orleans and lived in
thstt city for many years, removing to Ar
kansas and thence to Oklahoma a few
years ago. In all his wanderings he has
carefully preserved the crude map show
ing the location of the buried treasure,
but fearing arrest for his old crime he
would never venture Into Mexico after
the. wealth. A few weeks ago he re
vealed the secret of his life to Renchart
and the latter accepted the charge of get
ting possession of the treasure of his cli
ent, whose name he declines to divulge.
The older residents of Monterey remem
ber well the many acts of lawlessness
committed by a band of , American
brigands in the vicinity of this city during
the latter *60's, and credence is placed
on the story told by Renchart.' There 13
much interest taken here in his efforts
to obtain possession of the treasure.
MONTEREY, Mexico, June 8.â Thomas
H. . Renchart, an attorney of Guthrie,
Oklahoma, is in Monterey for the pur
pose of finding burled treasure to the
amount of $600,000 in gold bullion. . He is
convinced that his mission will be suc
cessful, but before securing the fortune
he desires to secure permission of the
Government of this State to remove it
from Mexico. Under the law of this coun
try one-half ; of any discovered treasure
goes to the Government and the remainder
cannot be removed from the country.
Renchart is endeavoring to secure an ex
emption from both these provisions of
the law, but if the . Government is un
willing to waive its right to one-half of
the treasure he at least. hopes to be per
mitted to remove the remainder out of
the country. Renchart says that he
knows the exact locatloiy' of the buried
bullion and that It will take him but a
short time to secure it when the legal ob
stacles above referred to are removed.
The cable bill will be given two and the
irrigation bill three days. The cable bill
provides for an American-built and an
American-laid cable to connect our insu
lar possessions in the Pacific with the Pa
cific Coast. It carries a direct appropria
tion out of .the treasury for this purpose.
The prospects for its passage are not con
sidered bright. Corliss, the author of the
bill, professes confidence that it will pass.
The opposition to the measure believes
the cable to the Philippines should be laid
by private enterprise. Some of the House
leaders, including Cannon, Â¦ chairman of
the Appropriations Committee, it is un
derstood, will oppose the irrigation bill,
but the friends of the measure are very
hopeful of its passage. To-morrow is Dis
trict of Columbia day. All the appropria
tion bills except the general deficiency,
Â¦which will not be ready until next week,
hc-ve passed the House.
The House programme for the week
contemplates consideration of the Pacific
cable and the Senate Irrigation bills, which
the Rules Committee is anxious to have
disposed of before the time set for taking
up the Philippine government bill. Spe
cial rules have been prepared for consid
eration of both measures.
It is probable that Senator Hale will
call up the naval appropriation bill dur
ing the week, but he has given no notice
of such intention.
To-morrow in the morning hour Senator
Simmons of North Carolina will speak on
the bill creating a national park in the
Southern Appalachian Mountains, and in
accordance with the agreement reaefacd
yesterday the morning hour of other days
will be devoted to consideration of Sen
ator Nelson's bill for the abolition of the
London dock charges until a vote shall
be taken upon It. Saturday after 4 o'clock
the Senate will listen to eulogies on the
character of the late Representative
Stokes of South Carolina. On Friday the
nomination of General William. Crozier
to be chief of the Ordnance Bureau will
be considered in executive session.
WASHINGTON. June 8.â The greater
part of the time in the Senate this week
will be given to the interoceanic canal
bill. An effort probably will be made by
the supporters of the Nicaragua route to
secure an agreement to vote on the bill
next Saturday, but the probabilities are
all against success. Senator Harris of
Kansas will open the debate to-morrow
in support of the Nicaragua route, and
he will be followed by various other Sen
ators for and against the measure. Sen
ator Fairbanks has given formal . notice
of a speech on Wednesday. He will sup
port the Spooner bill. -

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
Details of the steam trials of the Rus
sian cruiser Askold are given in the May
number of the Marine Rundschau, from
which the following information relating
to this novel naval craft are condensed.
The British torpedo gunboat Gossamer,
one of twelve vessels built ten years ago,
has been reconstructed at a cost of $298,
740, of which $60,375 on hull and $261,550 for
new machinery. At her recent trial the
boat made' a speed of 20.32 knots with 6058
horsepower, or .68 knot less than the con
tract called for, but the result was con
sidered satisfactory and the machinery
was accepted. It Is an improvement upon
the first trials when these twelve vessels
were built, as their horsepower arid speed
fell consiedrably short -of the calculations.
They were Intended to develop 4500 horse
power and j 21 knots speed, but .only
reached 19 . knots ] with 3600 horsepower,
and they have been of little or no service.
The Seagull, another boat of the Gossa
mer type, has been fitted with Niclause
boilers and has been undergoing . experi
mental trials for a year past. The orig
inal cost of the Gossamer was $319,450,
and it seems almost to be a waste of
money to expend a sum equal to nearly. 90
per cent of the first cost upon a vessel
twelve years old in order to make her a
couple of knots speedier.'
Small-arm .practice in the British navy
is greatly neglected. The report of 1900-01
shows that there were seventy-two ships
on which no drill with rifles and pistols
had been carried on during that period,
and that the total number of sailors thus
unlnstructed numbered 15,339.
in 1861. The Warrior was of 9210
tons and her cost was $1,884,950 for hull,
armor and machinery. During the follow
ing twenty years the tonnage increased to
11,000 tons and, the cost to $2,500,000, after
which. came the Royal Sovereign class of
1M50 tons at $4,250,000. The Majestic class
of 14,900 tons, built in 1S94 and 1S96, cost
54,500,000; the Canopus class, 12,950 tons,
cost $4,300,000; the Formidable of 15,000
tons cost $5,000,000; the Duncan class, 14,000
tons, cost $5,500,000, bringing the fleet down
to the King Edward VII, of 16,350 tons, to
cost $e,5oo,ooo.
THE cost of armored shlps-of-the
line in the British navy has vastly
increased since the first ship of
that classâ the "Warriorâ was built
the contract as being too risky, and the
work was given to the Ansaldo yard,
which was willing to take the risk. At the
recent steam trial the ship reached a
maximum speed of 17% knots and aver
aged 16.75 knot3 for the run, and the
builders are confident of still further in
creasing the speed by a slight change of
the pitch of the screws. The Messoudleh
â¢was built in 1874 at the Thames Iron
Works, London, and had a speed of 13
knots, with 7431 horsepower. The new
engines and water tube boilers are of
10,000 horsepower. A new armament of
two 9.2-lnch, twelve 6-lnch quick-firing,
fourteen 3-inch and six 6-pounder3 is be
ing supplied by the VIckers-Maxim Com
pany.

The Austrian naval budget for 1302-03
is $10,175,000, of which nearly $3,000,000 is
for extraordinary expenditures, such as
new ships, armament, improvements in
dockyards, etc.

The Spanish Navy League offers prizes
ranging from $1000 to $500 for the best
codes of maritime law in Spanish not
hitherto published. This indicates an
awakening interest in naval affairs in
that country, a sentiment much needed to
create a new navy. And this is a re
minder of the fact that Russia and the
United States are the only naval power3
having no bona fide navy leagues. There
is apparently no general public interest
manifested in these two countries on the
subject of naval defenses.
- Japan's alleged naval programme ln^
vclves an outlay of about $60,000,000, dis
tributed over a period of six years. Tak
ir.g the past year's expenditure as a basi3,
the naval appropriations would increase
from $18,500,000 to about $25,000,000, and
there will be considerable trouble to raise
this increased amount by taxation or in
a foreign hjan. Nearly $100,000,000 has been
expended oh new construction between
1S94 and 1902, and the navy, which is prac
tically new, numbers 139 vessels of all
classes, with a total of 251,498 tons. Tha
new programme, embracing five battle
ships, two armored cruisers, eight pro
tected cruisers and ten destroyers, would
increase the navy by 1910 to 165 .vessels
with a total of 387,398 tons.
The firm of Ansaldo & Co., Genoa; has
scored a decided victory over British
shipbuilders in the reconstruction of the-
Turkish battleship Messoudleh. The con
ditions under which the contract was
awarded stipulated a minimum speed of 15
knots with the new machinery and a pen
alty of $250,000 for failure to reach that
speed. Prominent English firms refused
* The Rivista Maritima, an Italian naval
service journal, contains an article from
Major Manfred! on the coast defenses of
Italy, He is unqualifiedly in favor of
submarine boats, and contends that a
liberal number of such boats distributed
at- seaport cities would make It Impossi
ble for any enemy to either bombard,
blockade or effect a landing of .'troops.
The presence or the suspicion of the'prox
iir.ity,.of a submarine boat would make
foreign ships keep clear of the coast, and
he urges the press to impress upon the
public the necessity of raising funds by
popular subscription to build a number
of submarines for the defense of coast
towns.
The contract was given to the Germania
or Krupp's yard at Kiel in August, 180S,
to build a cruiser of 6000 tons displace
ment, 23 knots speed In deep water, nor
mal ccal 720 tons and a bunker capacity
of 1050 to 1100 tons. The armament i3 to
consist of twelve 5.9-inch, twelve 12
pounders, eight 6-pounders, six lighter
puns and six torpedo tubes, two of which
latter are under water. The ship, is 426.5
feet in length between perpendiculars,
49.3 feet beam and 20 feet 3 Inches
draught, and her sole armor protection is
a nickel steel protective deck 1.58 inches
to 2.95 inches In thickness, that part of "*
the machinery above water having a cas
ing of 3.95-inch armor. The vessel has
three crews and is fitted with Schulz
Â¦water tube boilers calculated to develop
19,000 horsepower. On August 1, 1901. a
trial over the measured mile was made
under forced draught in shallow water,
vÂ«-hen 22,900 horsepower and 22.9 knots
v.'ere developed. Later on two deep sea
trials of six hours' duration were made,
the ship displacing 6100 tons, when the fol
lowing results were obtained: Highest
horsepower, 23,600; speed, 24.5 knots; mean
horsepower of twelve hours, 20,405; speed,
23.6 knots; mean consumption of coal per
unit of horsepower, 1.85 pounds.

FOGSâ Subscriber, City. Fogs are. gen
erally speaking, caused by the precipita
tion of ; the moisture - of the atmosphere.'
They are formed when a warm stratum
of atmosphere comes in contact A with a
cold stratum or with a portion of the
earth's surface, , as a hill, by which It is
cooled so 'that it ; can no longer hold as
much moisture in solution as before. This
causes the frequent fogs in mountain re
gions. When a cold. stratum of air comes
over, a moist, warm part.' of the earth's
surface a fog is also formed. This la the
cause of the mists that appear over lakes
rivers and marshes in the evening, since
t*aa water is then warmer than the at
mosphere above it. The blackness and
density of London fogs are caused by the
simple fact that the mist formed in the
upper air mingles with the ascending
clouds of smoke from hundreds of thou
sands of chimneys, and descending brings
the smoke with It and, settles like a pall
above the buildings and in the streets of
the city.
BELGIANS-A. P., City. While it is

if the Â¦_ statement that "all Belgian . sol
diers are socialists and would not fire
upon socialists," is true or not.

The Rev. Thomas Van Ness of Boston has
told his people that the big armies and navies of the
nations will soon pass away because the eager thirst
for wealth, will generate such a fierce industrial and
financial competition that no people â¢ will be, able to

ment is ingenious, but it will be remembered that in

ANSWERS TO QUERIES;
All bankers believe that the public and private
credit were put in great peril by the agitation of false
financial theories in 1896. If they believe, also, that
cne great cause of this peril was the, inequality in the
rate of discount which made the use of credit costly
at points remote from money centers they should ac
company their opposition to the Fowler bill with
suggestion of some other means to get the result ex
pected of that measure. The borrowers are a more
numerous class than the lenders and their interests
must not be forgotten, for as a rule they represent
the commercial and industrial enterprise of the
The New York Journal of Commerce approves of
these statements of the Bankers' Magazine and adds
that in this country alone is the principle of branch
banking disregarded. In the days of State ' banks,
however, branch banking was recognized, with the
result that rates for money were equal everywhere in
the State. Hugh McCulloch, who ranks among
the great Secretaries of the Treasury, organized the
State Bank of Indiana, with branches all, over the
State, and as. president of the mother bank at Fort
Wayne, 'put an end to the Indiana "red dog" cur
rency and redeemed the financial reputation of that
State. Surely a system that has worked well in other
countries, and that was in successful operation here
until State banks were obsoleted by our national sys
tem, is deserving of close examination, as a means
for. equal distribution of thejoan fund of the country,
in order to equalize the rate of discount.
In the Dominion of Ganada the branches- of the
thirty-seven chartered banks everywhere make the
same rate, whether in the lumber towns of Ontario,
the wheat district of Manitoba or mining camps of
the Rocky Mountains, and it never exceeds an ad
vance of 2 per cent upon Toronto, Quebec or Mon
treal.
Where" branch banking prevails and a flexible cur
rency is permitted no such difference is found. The
Reichsbank of Germany has branches in 316 cities,
and the rate in them is identical. The Bank of
France through its branches has an identical rate
for the same class of loans and' securities in every
department. The Bankers' .'. Magazine says that the
same conditions exist,~due to the same cause, in Italy,
Belgium and Holland. ' In England , the country
bank rate 'is always the same, and in Scotland a
thousand banks'have an identical rate
In these rates may be found one cause, and a great
cause, of the intense Southern and Western agitation
of the money question. With money at 4.41 in New
York and from 5.90 to 10 in the South and West, is
it any wonder that the people were willing listeners to
charges against Wall street and plans for making
money plenty?

The Bankers': Magazine ,for January, 1899,., pub
lished a statement of the'reasons which are believed
to support Mr. Fowler's bill. reports the
average rate of discounts from 1893 to 1897 in differ
ent parts.of the country, showing the increase in rate
with, the increase in di&tance from New York, as fol
lows, the average of the lower and the higher rates
being given:
The theory I of. the bill.- is that such a system of
branch banks and currency will equalize the rate of
discount or interest by. preventing currency con
gestion in the money centers.
THE Bankers'. Association of California seems
not to be alone in opposing the Fowler bill for,
branch banking and' currency issue on assets
other than national bonds.

Altogether it is a very pretty issue for. statesmen to
wrangle over.. To the Liberals it is sbmething of a
stroke of good luck. ' It: has furnished them with an
issue on which they can unite, and from the speeches
of Rosebery and Asquith it seems they are ready to
attack it whether, designed for the benefit of the
colonies or for that' of . the .imperial treasury. -

INCREASING IMPROVEMENT AND COST
OF BRITAIN'S LINE-OF-BATTLE SHIPS
TRADE QUIET AND' FEATURELESS.
THE EXCURSION STATE.
CALIFORNIA is par excellence the excursion
State!" Every company of Eastern people
who wish to go somewhere discuss 'a trip to
California , first. Every Eastern rival has been sub
dued. This State is firmly established as the best
summer resort and the best winter resort, the best
all-the-year-round place in the world. Italy and the
Mediterranean countries are losing their prestige.
They have more human history than we, but less hu
man comfort, and; after all, physical comfort is what
people want who seek recreation. The South Atlan
tic seaboard, from the Virginia capes to the Gulf of
Mexico, once found favor as a. place to spend vaca
tions in, but people have discovered that to the
northern physique that region is too enervating. It
slackens the physical fiber too much. There is some
pleasure in its languor, but the general effect Â« is
weakening, rather than tonic and strengthening. In
the mountain States the altitude is a discomfort to
many. People who are traveling in the luxurious
way now within the. reach of all soon feel the need of
physical exercise and in those high altitudes they
lose their breath and find an unpleasant acceleration
of the pulse, which to many, is alarming and to all a
discomfort. When they reach California they find
the perfection of physical conditions. At no season
is it too hot or too cold. In medicine all tonics are
bitter. The tonic of California climate is sweet. Here
is no languor, but visitors find in the climate a zest
that makes youth glorious and age vigorous.
Go where you will in the East, people are found
who still dream of California and the hospitality of
our people, the splendors of our scenery and the lux-,
urious embrace of our climate, as they enjoyed them
with the long past excursions of the Knights Tem
plar, the Grand Army of the Republic, the American
Educational Association and other bodies and organ
izations that have sojourned here with pleasure and
departed with regret. We have booked for this sea
son the Mystic Shriners and the Knights of Pythias.
If the Oriental folk, after whose ways and manners
the Shriners copy, were in the company that is com
ing they would declare that the Orient, '.from the
Euphrates to the Irawadi, has in . its crown no
jewels superior to those that are California's every
day wear. The Pythians will admit that -the friend
ship of the original Damon and Pythias would not
have survived a dispute over the majesty and beauty
and hospitality of California. These bodies have their
secret work, their grips, passwords and grand hail
ing signs, but they will admit that no. other' grip or
greeting is needed for admission to the hearts of our
people than that the comer is a stranger and well be
haved. ,
One fact is strengthened by experience and obser
vation, and that is that California never palls on the
visitor. Our variety is so infinite that there is some
thing here for everybody. The business man is im
pressed by our great multitude of resources; the tired
man by the restfulness of* our conditions; the artist
by our perfect : air and light and our matchless pan
orama of landscape, and the literary person tingles
with an inspiration to literary invention and purpose.
As a veteran business man of Boston puts it, con
fessing that fie is confirmed in the California habit:
"It is the best place on earth to do nothing and to do
anything."
The liberal policy of the railways is making it easy
for people to come here, whether home seeking or
pleasure seeking. Visitors are sure to find either.
. The Shriners are now en route and will soon throng
our streets. They will feel as if they had entered a
new world, a combination of Eden and Ophir, where
there is the best of everything that outside of Cali
fornia has to be sought separately in the several
grand divisions of the globe. Let them feel that it is
impossible to overtax our hospitality or exhaust our
good cheer.
The price of coal has been rapidly rising in New
York, but then the thermometer is going up with it
and in a few days the people will be able to broil
their steaks in the sunshine â provided they can get
a steak.
THE BRITISH GRAIN TAX
THE midsummer lull in trade seems to have
appeared earlier than usual this year. , From all
sections of the country come reports of quiet
and featureless markets. The bank clearings showed a
loss last week of 32.7 per cent, the largest deficiency
for a long time, and of the large cities only three â
St. Louts, Cleveland and New Orleans â exhibited a
gain over last year. Not for several years have so
many leading cities shown a decrease in bank clear
ings as last week. The aggregate clearings, too, fell
off considerably, being only $1,796,823,000, of which
$1,060,421,000 was credited to New York. The fail
ures were 218, against 192 for the same week in 1901.
Labor troubles are charged w.ith this falling off in*
business as reflected by the clearings, but this ground
is hardly well taken, considering that Chicago, where
the most serious strike prevailed, showed a smaller
percentage of loss than most of the other great trade
centers. A glance at the itemized list of clearings
would rather indicate a general diminution of busi
ness throughout the country- This may mean noth
ing more than the usual summer halt, for no com
plaints are being received from any part of the
United States. Collections are reported up to the
average, the jobbing and retail business is above the
normal in activity, and whatever halt there is seems
to be in the larger commercial movements, such as
exportation and importation and manufacturing. The
railroads are still doing a rushing business, the earn
ings being ahead of all previous years, while jobbers
are reporting a better demand for dry goods. The
other staples are wholly devoid of feature, and show
no disposition either to advance or decline. As far
as commercial fluctuations are concerned the trade of
the country seems to be on a level and undeviating
plane.
Peace in South Africa is expected to stimulate
trade in more than one way. Manufacturers and
other exporters are rather looking forward to an
increased demand for their goods in consequence,
while the moneyed interests are talking about a large
increase in gold production and a resultant
ease in -the money markets at the different financial
centers of the world. Wall street, however, has thus
far failed to exhibit any pronounced reanimation
since the war was formally declared closed, and in
fact trading in that mart was quieter last week than
for a long time, the market being almost neglected
on several days.
Conditions in California show no change whatever.
Good crops, good prices and a good demand for al
most everything produced' in the State combine to
keep things moving along briskly on the whole
coast, and there are no complaints from any quar
ter. The crops are now so far advanced that they are
not likely to be seriously damaged by unfavorable
â¢/eather, and as stocks of California products are so
zfmall in those markets where these products find an
outlet that prospects are for profitable' prices to rule
during the rest of the ycaj. This of course creates
general confidence all over the coast, and the result
is seen in an active movement of produce and mer
chandise, with good collections, few and small fail
ures and an abundance of available capital in all di
rections. Whatever conditions may prevail in other
parts of the country there is certainly no commercial
lassitude in the three Pacific Coast States. Times
could not be better and be safe, for if business were
more actii-e it would partake of the nature of a boom,
which is seldom a desirable condition. We are doing
first rate, and are wise if we let it rest at that point.
Talk about municipal enterprise! Here is a case
of it. Twenty years ago Omaha set about working
for the erection of a market building to cost $200,000
and now the Omaha Bee says the people have de
cided to compromise on one that will cost $15,000.
The Chamberlain family is ahead. Joe is still run
ning the British empire, and another Chamberlain is
about to take charge of Oregon.
LORD ROSEBERY speaking at Leeds a few
days ago is reported to have said the grain
tax proposed by the Ministry is designed as a
sort of prelude to a sort of fiscal union throughout
the empire, but that even on that ground it is inde
fensible, because "it would necessitate the surrender
by Parliament of. control of the fiscal policy of the
kingdom and transfer it to the colonies."
The argument it will be seen is similar to that ad
vanced by Senator Hoar against any extensive sys
tem of reciprocity on the part of the United States,
since such treaties would inevitably take controlof
our customs duties out of the hands of Congress and
place it in the hands of the State Department. The
Rosebery argument, however, is by no means so
strong as that of Senator Hoar, for While reciprocity
treaties would mean the interference of foreign pow
ers in the arrangement of American tariffs the
Chamberlain scheme of an imperial tariff for Great
Britain would leave the control after all in the hands
of statesmen all of whom are members of the British
empire.
It is by no means certain, however, that the Min
istry designs to use the grain duties as a means of
giving preferential rates to the colonies, thus bring
ing the empire into "a sort of fiscal federation. It
may be the tax on grain is designed pure and simple
for the purpose of obtaining an increased revenue.
That view has been taken by some Liberals and they
have urged objections to it on - the ground .that it
would be unjust to the colonies.
In a speech at Free Trade Hall at Manchester Mr.
Asquith is reported to have said that ttie. Canadian
would' say: "I import into Great Britain for the
British market large quantities of wheat and flour.
You are putting a tax on my flour and -my wheat
when it comes into the market, but the British farm
er at home who is producing the same commodity
pays no tax at all. Here we aVe, joint members of the
same . empire, subjects of the same sovereign; ,we
have contributed in the war that is going on of our
blood, of our very best, to the support of our cause,
and you seize that moment, when we hope and believe
the war is coming to an end, to discriminate against
your own fellow-subjecfc of thecolonies and in favor
of our fellow-subjects at home."
Meantime the statesmen of the colonies seem to be
fairly certain they will get a preferential. rate in the
British market. They will at least demand it. Speak
ing at Wellington some time ago! Mr. Seddon, the
New Zealand Prime Minister, said he had -''notified'
the British Ministry that in the conference of Colon
ial Premiers with the Ministers to be held during the
coronation .festivities, the question of a preferential
tariff- must ;hold the foremost place. Sir Wilfrid
Laurierof Canada is reported to have said that while
nothing had been assured on that subject he was sari-
Cuban General Gomez has refused a pension.
Won't he please come right here and teach a lot of
people how he did it?

the well known barytone and light come
dian; Mile. Laurelle, . the "Queen of

The school children of the city were the
guests of the Chutes yesterday and be
tween 10 o'clock in the morning and mid
night more than tw^nty-flve thousand
people passed through the turnstiles
Harvey Downing in his great act of
"looping the loop" on. a bicycle is coming
next week.
"A Guilty Mother," a melodrama of
laughter and tears, Is on this week at the
Central Theater. The cast Is unusually
strong and contains such well known
fevorites as Fanny Mclntyre. Annette
Marshall, Margaret Wycherly, Georgle
Cooper, Agnes Rankln, Mabel Bowman,
Earl Brown, James Corrigan, Julius Mc-
Vicker, Edwin T. Emory, Elmer Booth,
George Nichols and George P. Webster.
Ten long weeks and "Fiddle Dee Dee"
Is still running to full houses at Fischer's
Theater. For Shriners" week there will
be a host of novelties and Kolb, Dill and
Bernard will Introduce some quaint say-
Ings relative to the Mystic Nobles. On
Wednesday afternoon there will be a
special matinee performance by the fa
mous Pollard Juvenile Opera Company
when a complete production of "Pina
fore" will be given. This Is the last time
the 'public will have an opportunity of
seeing these clever little artists, as they
pail on the Sierra on Thursday for Aus
tralia.
"The Toy Maker" will continue another
week at the Tivoli. The tuneful opera is
sung by a great cast, and the audiences
have been highly pleased with the produc
tion. Numerous mechanical novelties are
introduced, and Ferris Hartman and
Harry Cashman furnish lots of fun. On
Saturday next every child attending the
matinee will be presented with a hand'
some toy.
Maude Fealy will present Jerome K.
Jerome's clever comedy, "Miss Hobbs," at
the Grand Opera-house this week. The
young actress has made scores of friends
by her clever acting and" is rapidly becom
ing a favorite. Her delineation of the
leading role in "My Lady Dainty" last
week stamps her an actress of marked
ability.
The Columbia Theater audience this
evening will be measured only by the
capacity of the house. The occasion will
be the appearance of Henry Miller, Mar
garet Anglin and a special company in A.
W. Pinero's comedietta in four acts, en
titled "Trelawny of the Wells." The stars
will be surrounded by the full strength of
their magnificent supporting company, in
cluding among others: William Court
leigh, Charles Walcot, Lawrence d'Orsay,
Fred Thome, Arthur Elliott, Charles
Gotthold, Walter Allen, E. Y. Backus,
Otis Turner, Mrs. Thomas Whiffen, Mrs.
Charles Walcot, Ethel Hornick, Jennie
Eustace, Grace Elliston, Dorpthy Ten
nant, Josephine Wyndham, Martha Wal
dron and Lillian Thurgate. The opening
piece of the season, "Trelawny of the
Wells," will J)e seen all of this week, in
cluding Wednesday and Saturday mati
nees. The comedy was a brilliant success
at the Lyceum Theater, New York, where
it ran for over a hundred nights. Its story
is simple and yet unusually attractive, and
with the splendid cast to appear in it this
evening should prove doubly interesting.
Standing room will be at a premium this
evening at the Alcazar. Florence Uoberts
and a strong company opens at the thea
ter in David Beiasco's greatest piay,
"Zaza." This is Miss Roberts' fifth sea
son, and she will be accorded a generous
welcome when she steps on the stage to
night. White Whittlesey will support
her as leading man. The production is
one of the biggest ever given at tne popu
lar playhouse. Messrs. Belasco & Thall
have spared no expense to make the pro
duction a worthy one. The theater has
been newly painted and carpeted and pre
sents a handsome appearance.
The absence of "the Moto Girl" at the
Orpneum last evening was keenly noted
by tne regular attendants, btage Man
ager. Ornaorlf's explanation that the lauy
had arrived, but ner baggage was de
layed, partly explained tne mystery as to
wnetner 'tne Moto Girl" was a human
being or an automaton. The lady will
make her debut to-nignt. Among the new
numbers were Cusnman, Hoicombe - and
Curtis, a singing trio, who scored heavily
two years ago with a schoolroom sKetch.
Their latest playiet, entitled "awells at
Sea," is far trom being funny, but the
singing of the trio is above the ordinary.
Howard Chambers, the New Zealand
barytone, made his American debut and
proved himself a splendid singer. Barton
and Ashley, presented "Canal Boat Sal"
as a side issue to their SKetch. Barton
plays a tramp in funny fashion and does
some difficult acrobatic dancing. The
Twin Nices open the bill and till in very
nicely. Irene Franklin Â¦ has a new song
about "Dreamy Kyes" that is catching.
Le Koy and Clayton are very good in
â¢ their Irish comedy, "Hogan of the Han
som." Murphy -and Slater do some won
denul dancing and the biograph closes tne
bill with some new views.
The Neill company presented "The Jilt,"
a delightful comedy In live acts, last night
at the California Theater. The play is a
new one to local theater-goers and it con
tains a most clever plot, with a quaint
strain of humor and here and there a lit
tle touch of love and pathos, which holds
the interest of the audience and at the
same time serves to bring out the strong
points of the actors in their different
roles.
"The Jilt" is an English play and deals
entirely with the life of tne British coun
try gentleman. Mr. Neill, who acts tne
part ot an Irish horseman, scored a suc
cess by his witty sanies and his clever In
terpretation of tne well chosen part,
jfckiythe Chapman, as the heroine, is aa
bewitching us ever and greatly pleased
her many admirers. Frank Me Vicars acts
the country gentleman to periectlon and
Scott aeaton as the parson made a' great
hit.
John W. Burton as the colonel was ex
ceedingly clever and Donald Bowies as
the vuialn acted has part well. Gertrude
Keller, who plays the part of Phyliss, is a
lxis Angeles girl ana was engaged last
week by Mr. jNeill. she lmmeaiaiely be
came popular ana performed her part
with rare sKlll. J In tact, all the memDers
of the clever company are at their best
and the play bids lair to have a most suc
cessful run.
The race track scene in the last act is
probably the best of its kind ever seen
at a local playhouse.

mands cf foreign powers.

was about sixteen hours late. ' The ti ip
was made without accident. The Acapul
co brings a cargo of 626 tons of freight,
mostly coffee. She has 6094 bags of sugar,
aboard. She brought a full list of pas
sengers, among whom is Louis Hirsch
and family. Mr. Hirsch when asked as to
the report of volcanic outbursts' near
Retarauleu said: "I left the settlement of
Rttalhuleu on the 26th of May, and up to
that time there had been no outburst of
any kind, although the people daily ex
pected one. Severe earthquakes . have
been of daily occurrence, and an eruption
in the interior would be thankfuly ro
ceived, as it could do no damage to the
settlements, which are a good distance
away, and would relieve the people of the
serious earthquakes, which have done
considerable damage lately."

Drops Dead in a Drugstore.
. UKIAH. June 8 âA stranger entered Dr.
W. N. iJoore's drugstore this morning
and stated to tha clerk that he was suf
fering intense pain and wanted something
that would give relief. Then he started
to sit down, but fell to the floor dead.
The ca'use of death was fatty degenera
tion of the heart. Letters found on tha
person of the man showed his name to
be John N. Graham, probably a resident
of Sausalito. He had been up to. John
Days, an Eel River resort. He waa well
dressed and appeared to be about 30 years
old.
The attendance .was rather light on the
California courts and the matches ; for the
most part were not high class,", as few of
the good players were on'hand.A.-Worth

Joe Daily, figured in a six-set contest, in

former. The score in Collier's favor was
9-7, 6-4.. The winner seems to play a much
better game in warm weather, while it. is
just the reverse with his, opponent. Frank
Mitchell proved too strong for Sidney
Salisbury and beat him three straight
sets. The score was 6-1, 6-1, 7-5.
Despite the feret that three of the court3
had been recently oiled there was' an ex
tremely large crowd on' the park courts.
In singles Charles ' Dunlap, the park
champion, and James A. Code Â¦â¢furnished
the best match. Dunlap's- swift chop
strokes were too much for his opponent,
whom he beat two straight ' sets. -".The
score was 6-0, 7-5. Other singles matches
resulted, as follows: C. Adams beat

Â¦Many good tennis matches were played
yesterday on the San Rafael , and local
courts. Several of the crack players from
the California Club journeyed to San Ra
fael to become accustomed to '.the courts
on which the State championship matches
will be played next month. W. B.'. Collier
and Harold Crowell furnished the best
match, in which the honors went to the
Commodore R. S. Bridgman, in the flag
ship Thetis, Vice Commodore A, C. Lee, in
the sloop' Surprise, and'Dr. T. -L. Hill, in
the sloop Queen, sailed "up to McNears
and anchored there. .Jules Hartman's
sloop Mascotte of the . California Yacht
Club and one of Boatman Crowley's
launches took large parties â¢ up to Mc-
Nears. The run up was made under a
light, breeze on the flood tide and the re
turn on the ebb tide with a good ; breeze
late in the afternoon. /The sloop Queen
though starting later than the Thetis and
Surprise, made her moorings off the club
house considerably ahead of them: The
yechts Rover, Chispa, White Wings and
Tramontana were also under way. â¢
A meeting will soon be held of the sub
scribers to the fund for building the Chal
lengerr at which sealed bids for her pur
chase will be presented. It is probable
the highest bidder will become the owner
of the cup winner. The â¢ San Francisco
Yacht Club will soon give a reception in
Its Sausalito clubhouse for the purpose of
formally receiving the perpetual challenge

made home. Raymer picked up the ball
in time to retire Dunleavy by a close
margin.
When Reilly went to bat in the same
inning he was presented with a numer
ously signed petition asking him to take
the captaincy once more. Reilly did not
know the contents of the paper that was
presented to him. He responded with' a
double to the center field fence. Dever
eaux's good work kept Reilly at second
while Anderson was being retired at first.
Then Roach scored Reilly with a low liner
over second base. Another run was made
In the fourth and one in the sixth. Score:

rowing regatta on . Lake Merritt
were held to-day on the estuary.
The scullers pulled against time over a
mile and a half course with a turn. De
spite the strong tide and a ship anchored
near the turning stake that made it neces
sary for the rowers to pull nearly five
hundred feet out of their course the time
made was considered good.
In the junior skiff class E. B. Thorning
covered the distance in 11:37. JVC. Stamer
went over the course in 11:54?4- Jack

skiff class, doing the distance in .11:41. C.

The game yesterday afternoon ' was a
dead ringer lor the weather, which was
superb. The crowd was a large one and
heartily enjoyed the fast, snappy playing
which was in vogue from the call of
"Play ball."
The Senators played without a bad mark
on their error column, and. would have
tied up the series had they been able to
push ihe ball around the lot in Keeping
with their fielding.
Nordyke, the old home run favorite,
made the hearts of the fans feel good
-when he -walloped 'the sphere over the
"center garden inclosure, when Whalen
and McHale occupied places on the bags,
â¢ in the third. This gave the Ponies a swell
lead and served to take much of the gin
ger and the activity out of the capital
city tossers.
'ihe surprise of the day came in the
seventh spasm when Jimmie Whalen
punched tne leather to left field for a to
tal of three sacks. It was a pretty hit,
and Jimmy swelled up like a balloon. Mc-
Hale laid down a pretty bunt, and Gra
ham hesitated long enough 'for Bobby to
reach first. Captain Shugart scored both
with a hot drive to center and ended the
local scoring.
Kordyke's two bad errors served to
score Doyle and Hulen in the fifth, with
out the aid of a solitary safe bang. Ea
-ran's single, Glendon's muff of Lawler's
fly and Graham's infield out gave Sacra
mento men their final mark in the closing
volley of trouble.
Unglaub played a splendid game at short,
and Shugart ut second, for the Ponies, had
evervUung that happened to roll in his
direction. Tommy Leahy is slightly injur
ed, and McHale did stunts in the rear of
the bat and performed in exceedingly good
form. The Senators have a husky looking
woodchopper named Wilson, who caught
hold of Lhe stick in Wagner's stead in
the ninth, but could do nothing but a
fancy pose and knock a dinky grounder
to der Whale. The score:

MORNING GAME.
When the Pony hosts were marshaled
over on Ewing's playground it was dis
covered that they were shy a few men,
j and so Uncle had to use his entire pitch
ing staff in order to put up a fighting
front. McHale went behind the bat and
caught a first-class game.
The feature was the . first victory for
Cutter, the college chap. He pitched gilt
edged ball, barring a little wiidness. He
didn't allow the Ponies to bunch safeties
on him. Kane also performed well, al

The series just closed keeps the teams
in the same relative position they have
occupied for the past six weeks. Oak
land still has an enormous lead, while Los
Angeles is second, with the Ponies gallop
ing at a hard pace and liable to arrive at
any old moment. Poor Fisher's lads have
the same old j tale of woe to pass outâ
hopelessly lost and bright prospects to be
the rear guard for one leng time.
The Senators managed to Cling to that
piece of good luck which they caught on
the wing Saturday, just long enough to
bring them one victory yesterday. It
fiitted away from their clinging grasp be
fore they could call the second struggle
their exclusive property.
Sacramento won the morning game, 3 to

Drops Dead in a Drugstore.
. UKIAH. June 8 âA stranger entered Dr.
W. N. iJoore's drugstore this morning
and stated to tha clerk that he was suf
fering intense pain and wanted something
that would give relief. Then he started
to sit down, but fell to the floor dead.
The ca'use of death was fatty degenera
tion of the heart. Letters found on tha
person of the man showed his name to
be John N. Graham, probably a resident
of Sausalito. He had been up to. John
Days, an Eel River resort. He waa well
dressed and appeared to be about 30 years
old.
The attendance .was rather light on the
California courts and the matches ; for the
most part were not high class,", as few of
the good players were on'hand.A.-Worth

9-7, 6-4.. The winner seems to play a much
better game in warm weather, while it. is
just the reverse with his, opponent. Frank
Mitchell proved too strong for Sidney
Salisbury and beat him three straight
sets. The score was 6-1, 6-1, 7-5.
Despite the feret that three of the court3
had been recently oiled there was' an ex
tremely large crowd on' the park courts.
In singles Charles ' Dunlap, the park
champion, and James A. Code Â¦â¢furnished
the best match. Dunlap's- swift chop

whom he beat two straight ' sets. -".The

Â¦Many good tennis matches were played
yesterday on the San Rafael , and local
courts. Several of the crack players from
the California Club journeyed to San Ra
fael to become accustomed to '.the courts
on which the State championship matches
will be played next month. W. B.'. Collier
and Harold Crowell furnished the best
match, in which the honors went to the
Commodore R. S. Bridgman, in the flag
ship Thetis, Vice Commodore A, C. Lee, in
the sloop' Surprise, and'Dr. T. -L. Hill, in
the sloop Queen, sailed "up to McNears
and anchored there. .Jules Hartman's
sloop Mascotte of the . California Yacht
Club and one of Boatman Crowley's
launches took large parties â¢ up to Mc-
Nears. The run up was made under a
light, breeze on the flood tide and the re
turn on the ebb tide with a good ; breeze
late in the afternoon. /The sloop Queen
though starting later than the Thetis and
Surprise, made her moorings off the club
house considerably ahead of them: The
yechts Rover, Chispa, White Wings and
Tramontana were also under way. â¢
A meeting will soon be held of the sub
scribers to the fund for building the Chal
lengerr at which sealed bids for her pur
chase will be presented. It is probable
the highest bidder will become the owner
of the cup winner. The â¢ San Francisco
Yacht Club will soon give a reception in
Its Sausalito clubhouse for the purpose of
formally receiving the perpetual challenge

A LAMED A, June 8.â Tryouts to se
lect the scullers and bargemen
who will represent the Alameda
Boat Club in the Fourth of July
rowing regatta on . Lake Merritt
were held to-day on the estuary.
The scullers pulled against time over a
mile and a half course with a turn. De
spite the strong tide and a ship anchored
near the turning stake that made it neces
sary for the rowers to pull nearly five
hundred feet out of their course the time
made was considered good.
In the junior skiff class E. B. Thorning
covered the distance in 11:37. JVC. Stamer
went over the course in 11:54?4- Jack
Lewis made the best time In the senior
skiff class, doing the distance in .11:41. C.
G. Ayers made it in 13:12 3 : 5. Champion
F. W. -Ayers capsized and was disqualified.
Two crews entered in the junior four

The game yesterday afternoon ' was a
dead ringer lor the weather, which was
superb. The crowd was a large one and
heartily enjoyed the fast, snappy playing
which was in vogue from the call of
"Play ball."
The Senators played without a bad mark
on their error column, and. would have
tied up the series had they been able to
push ihe ball around the lot in Keeping
with their fielding.
Nordyke, the old home run favorite,
made the hearts of the fans feel good
-when he -walloped 'the sphere over the
"center garden inclosure, when Whalen
and McHale occupied places on the bags,
â¢ in the third. This gave the Ponies a swell
lead and served to take much of the gin
ger and the activity out of the capital
city tossers.
'ihe surprise of the day came in the
seventh spasm when Jimmie Whalen
punched tne leather to left field for a to
tal of three sacks. It was a pretty hit,
and Jimmy swelled up like a balloon. Mc-
Hale laid down a pretty bunt, and Gra
ham hesitated long enough 'for Bobby to
reach first. Captain Shugart scored both
with a hot drive to center and ended the
local scoring.
Kordyke's two bad errors served to
score Doyle and Hulen in the fifth, with
out the aid of a solitary safe bang. Ea
-ran's single, Glendon's muff of Lawler's
fly and Graham's infield out gave Sacra
mento men their final mark in the closing
volley of trouble.
Unglaub played a splendid game at short,
and Shugart ut second, for the Ponies, had
evervUung that happened to roll in his
direction. Tommy Leahy is slightly injur
ed, and McHale did stunts in the rear of
the bat and performed in exceedingly good
form. The Senators have a husky looking
woodchopper named Wilson, who caught
hold of Lhe stick in Wagner's stead in
the ninth, but could do nothing but a
fancy pose and knock a dinky grounder
to der Whale. The score:

MORNING GAME.
When the Pony hosts were marshaled
over on Ewing's playground it was dis
covered that they were shy a few men,
j and so Uncle had to use his entire pitch
ing staff in order to put up a fighting
front. McHale went behind the bat and
caught a first-class game.
The feature was the . first victory for
Cutter, the college chap. He pitched gilt
edged ball, barring a little wiidness. He
didn't allow the Ponies to bunch safeties
on him. Kane also performed well, al
lowing but three hits, but they all count

The series just closed keeps the teams
in the same relative position they have
occupied for the past six weeks. Oak
land still has an enormous lead, while Los
Angeles is second, with the Ponies gallop
ing at a hard pace and liable to arrive at
any old moment. Poor Fisher's lads have
the same old j tale of woe to pass outâ
hopelessly lost and bright prospects to be
the rear guard for one leng time.
The Senators managed to Cling to that
piece of good luck which they caught on
the wing Saturday, just long enough to
bring them one victory yesterday. It
fiitted away from their clinging grasp be
fore they could call the second struggle
their exclusive property.
Sacramento won the morning game, 3 to
1, but Uncle butted in at Recreation Park
and was there, 5 to 3. -

CLEVELAND, June 8.â The advisory
board of the Federation of American
Catholic Societies, which met here to-day,
adopted a resolution which will be sent
to the President at Washington protesting
against the conduct of the Philippine
schools, the claim being made that it is
a proselyting system, which seeks to
wean Catholic children from their faith.
The charge is made that Catholicism is
being deliberately discriminated against
in favor of Protestantism, and that con
sidering the fact that the Filipinos are a
Catholic people but scant recognition has
been given representatives ot that churoh
in the appointment of teachers and other
methods used in teaching the Filipinos.

give $20,000 to the man present who would

overheard the defy and volunteered to'
undertake the trip, stating, however, that
he would pay the money to the poor of
Palermo, Sicily, then in great distress, in

blackmail demand for $55,000, forced upon you
and your associates the necessity of resorting to
other nefarious devices. No! the cry of water
company can no longer avail you, for these are
the plain facts:
1. Some years ago you and your self-seeking
political associates obtained control of, the
Enquirer: at that time you kept a small sta
tionery store and were hopelessly in debt. No
one connected with the paper and the deal out-
Side of your clique ever supposed that you,
without means and without newspaper experi

fact was kept secret until its accomplishment,

Against this pacific statement comes
Frank J" Moffitt: with a signed declaration
that comes like a sulphurous .blast from
Mount Pelee. It breathes flre and,brim
stone, -and repeats, in detail his charge
that Paniels. took money from theÂ«county
for.-. work that was never done, and in
doing' this he- charges the- uewBpaper
manager, with having either robbed the
county or the stockholders of the paper.
He goes into the newspaper deal by which
Daniels secured, the -Enquirer, and charges
him with fraud in his management of the
paper and in the assessment book deal..

offer to pay the expenses of 'any action,
for libel that Daniels^ may bring against'
the writer. < <-Â¦':'Â¦_Â¦Â¦ Â¦ . . --\ â¢ â¢ :
But the editor considers the .Moffitt
statements as side issues-on a sidetrack
and he does not. purppse making any side

his fight is with the Contra Costa WatÂ«>r

ing the water dragon he will then turn
his attention to Mr. Moffltt. Whether
libelous or not the Moffitt statements will
be ignored for the present.
This is what Editor Daniels said to-day
about the Moffitt statement: "In regard

At the auction sale of the property be
longing to the estate of Adolph Sutro,
held by Baldwin & Howell yesterday, 163
lots were disposed of for the total sum of
$29,065. The sale attracted a large crowd
and the bidding was very spirited for a
large portion of the property. Some par
cels, however, were sold at extremely
low prices and the bids are likely to be
raised in court. The interest which was
taken in the sale was a good indication
of a healthy market. The sales were as
follows:
SUTEO LOTS ARE SOLD.
The southwest corner of Seventeenth and
Church streets, consisting of a lot, 55:6x100,

SOLD AT AUCTION".
The auction sale held last Wednesday
by Easton, Eldridge & Co. resulted In the
following sales :
There were- 46S real estate sales recorded In
the month of May, amounting: to $3,977,432.
There is still a very good demand for all kinds
of property, especially for Investments of $50,
000 to 1150,000. Good investments on the best
streets and paying & per cent net are not nearly
eo numerous as they were a yÂ«ar ago; in fact
they are scarce. The sales in the 50-vara sec
tion, that is, north of Market and east of Lax
it in, continue to be numerous and large in
amount. The number of purchases made with
the intention of immediately remodeling im
provements or replacing- old improvements en
tirely is increasing. Not because buyers pre
fer this kind of an investment, but because
there has been, and is still, plenty of money
to be made by buyers who have had experience
in thus making properties that have been pay
ing 3 or 4 iÂ«r cent net pay 5 per cent net on
a price that will allow them a profit. In the
present condition of the labor and material
market thÂ« buyer who purchases real estate,
erects buildings and gets first-class tenants
for five or ten year leases for his building cer
tainly earns a fair ftroflt and often makes a
very good one.

Preparations Going Forward
Rapidly With Promises of
Big Success.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, June 8.
Even this far in advance another "day"
can be crowded into the Elks' Carnival.
Every one of the eight days that tha
gates of the fair will be open have already
been absorbed by towns and fraternities
eager to shine. Applicants have been sq
importunate that the management begins
to think that it would have been proflti
able to have added a few more days to
the fete.
The White Highbinders have usurped
the two opening daysâ Friday and Satur
day. Alameda Tong and Oakland Tons.
attired In their Chinese habits, will escprt
their argus-eyed dragon in the parade
that is to occupy the streets Friday night
and then spread terror at the grounds
with their mystic incantations. The tonss
will continue this wild beginning Satur
day with another set of fanatical orgies
designed to "scare the daylights" out of,
innocent natives.
The Elks will have their "day" Monday,
when they will -make a herculean effort
to atone for the loss of Sunday. Chief of
many features will be the minstrel and
vaudeville show. - ,/
It will be "Knights of Pythias day"
Tuesday. The local lodges are planning a
big programme that will be given .pub
licity later in the week. The Native Sons
have engaged themselves to astonish the
spectators Wednesday, part of which
they will share with the people of Hay
wards. /
FRIDAY NIGHT'S PARADE.
"Woodmen's day" will occupy all of
Thursday, when there will be a plethora
of features for the amusement of the
friends of the order. Friday will be "Irian
day," with a grand "whoop-up," and Sat
urday will see the finish in a blaze ot
light, showers of confetti and the ming
ling of masked face?.
The parade nsxt Friday night 13 to be
a thing of beauty, even if it is a- Joy
ephemeral. The White Highbinders in
their picturesque garments will be the
chief attraction. The Elks' Lodge will
march in carnival clothes built for the oc
casion. In line with these orders will bo
the Grand Army men, Native Sons,
Woodmen of the World, Oakland Wheel
men, Foresters, National Guardsmen,
League of the Cross Cadets, Reliance
Club, Portuguese societies, Fraternal
Brotherhood, Young Men's Institute, Mer
chants' Exchange and the Board of

Hay wards has gone about the arrange
ments for its day in a most enterprising
way. The Board of Trade of that town
has taken hold of things and got the
promise of everybody to attend the carni
val Wednesday, the 18th- Arrangements
have been made for ten special cars t a
carry the crowd and a brass band. A
booth has been engaged and it will be
decorated In the grandest style imagin
able. . ...
CIRCUS EACH EVENING.
"The Country Store," Charley Heese
man manager, is being stocked with good.?
with which to fool the gullible. The pur
chaser will be obliged to endure a good
deal of red tape before he will get his
hand on a package. He will first buy an
envelope containing a number which will
correspond with a numbered article that
he will carry away. The articles may
consist of anything, from an anchor to a
bustle.
The circus will be a nightly entertain
ment, where there will l>e clowns a ad
bareback riders legion. The county jail
i3 to be another source of amusement, for
visitors to the fete.
The inmates of foundling homes and or
phan asylums in Alameda County are to
be given an opportunity to see all the
good thlnfll at the fair. Chairman Mat
thews of the entertainment committee
has sent Invitations to these institutions
informing their superintendents that tholr
charges are welcome to enjoy the sights.
As people are expected from all over
the State a committee has been named to
look after hotel accommodations. The
committee has established itself In the
Board of Trade rooms, where the work of
securing all the available rooms In the
city Is being dispatched. When the visit
ors begin to arrive they will be looked
after like relatives.
VALLEJO LODGE ACTIVE.
The railroad company la doing "the
right thing" with the Elks. Division Su
perintendent Palmer has Informed the
Elks' committee on transportation that
the company will give one and one-third
rates while the fair is In progress, in
cluding June 22. The company will also
have coupons attached to tickets entitlija*
the holder to admission to the fair.
If every lodge of Elks in- the State
would display an Interest in the Oakland
street carnival equal to that of Vallejo
No. 539 the success of the Oakland lodes' a
efforts would be assured. The navy yard,
town lodge has chartered the steamer
General Frlsble for next Monday night,
and has made arrangements to bring 300
Elks and friends to Oakland to attend the
opening of the street carnival. The mem
bers or 559 will wear purple badges and
the invited guests will wear a badge o*
white announcing that "Oakland is to' be
the rendezvous of the herd."
The excursion arranged by the Vallejo
ites promises to be the most pleasureable
of any arranged by the "Brother Bills" Ik
the immediate vicinity of Oakland.

two Images that he would deliver- his .oracles

ance with this command to : Moses .'.that ;. the
statues of St. Ann and her blessed* child and
St. Anthony and the child Jesus were unveiled
here to-night.' These Images have been placed
on each side of the altar as If pointing to the
holiness ' within. These Images, ' ; from their
positions appear to be guarding the holiness
within. Between these two groups of statues
will ascend the prayers of . the people of this
church. Sinners will kneel before these stat
ues to ask mercy of heaven. : Â¦', ' :
The placing of Images In churches Is done
In accordance with God's command. The.
Catholic church has been the patron and de
pository of Images since the dawn of her exist
ence. Wherever Catholic . missionaries .have
gone there has been carried v the crucifix,, the

Image Catholics will cling through - life and
will ' press it to Â¦ their lips In the agonies of
Images embellish and adorn the house of God.
No church is complete without them. "-If the

, NEW YORK, June 8.â In, theatrical cir
cles universal sorrow is expressed over
the sad death of Robert Ferral, son of
Judge Ferral of San Francisco. Although
only 24 years old, he had great aptitude
for the theatrical business.
He left for Philadelphia almost imme
diately upon being appointed to his posi
tion there. Elated over his success ana
filled with youthful Enthusiasm over
bright prospects, he celebrated with some
young companions and drank, to exces3.
Young Mr. Ferral's conduct was displeas
ing to Keith, and he sent him a telegram
of dismissal. "Â¦â¢ Â¦ â¢' '
Ferral returned to his aunt's house* yes
terday bemoaning his hard fate and-re
proaching himself bitterly. He had. pro
vided himself with a bottle 'of carbolic
acid before entering the : house. He re
tired for a moment, and then coming into
Mrs. Corbett's presence said, "Well, aunt,
I have done it." .
She realized' what he had done when
she saw acid burns on his tongue.' Simple
restoratives at hand were quickly admin
istered. After taking the poison he evi
dently repented, for he eagerly drank
some milk and was rational enough to
give some directions for his own relief.
He lingered a half-hour. It Is believed
that his life might have been spared had

The ceremony of unveiling the monu
ment was exemplified with the ritualistic
ceremonies of the order, the following
neighbors acting as camp officers:
"The humblest life may be noble, while
the mightiest life may be contemptible.
The Woodmen find the best in the teach
ings of their craft, for honor and sturdy
manhood are foremost in their minds and
in their lives, and their actions. Wood
craft is founded on the highest ideals of
eternal life. In sickness and in death
Woodmen render practical assistance, a
principle that . is the foundation of the
craft."
WOODMEN'S IDEAXS.
"A few days ago," . said the' speaker,
"a distinguished citizen sank to his death
and all classes attended his funeral. They
assembled around . the bier of the good
man that they might show their respect.
During his life he had said, 'I want no
eulogy when I am gone; a man should
live his own eulogy.' . We, indeed, meas
ured men by their true standard.
The address was delivered by Neighbor
Merton C. Allen, who referred to the
memorial ceremonies of only a few days
since, when the whole nation stood by the
graves of the soldiers and sailors who had
passed away and laid upon their tombs
tributes of respect. It was, he said, an oc
casion when the people cast all else aside
in order to pay respect to the memory of
those who , had fallen in the service of
their country, as that day of sad memo
ries was sacred to them all, so was that
day upon which they, came together to
join In the memorial exercises to the de
parted Woodmen of the World. The ten
der sympathy of the nation was repeated
toward the order of woodcraft. He, the
speaker, might well say that "Though
dead, the departed members lived in their
memories and hearts." A monument to
the Woodmen of the World could be found
in every clime, yes, even in far away Af
rica, and Asia. A .Woodman's monument
was a monument to manhood and char
acter.
DELIVERS THE ADDRESS.
There was an orchestra of much excel
lence that discoursed appropriate selec
tions under the direction of Neighbor
Charles \Weisel, and the Knickerbocker
Male Quartette rendered the beautiful
numbers.! "Lead, Kindly Light," "Nearer,
My God to Thee," and "Sleep, . Neighbor,
Sleep." Miss, Flora A. Tippits sang the
beautiful soprano solo, "Angels JJright
and Fair:" "The Palms," too, was feel
ingly given as a cornet solo by Mr. Beach,
and Herbert Williams sang "The Holy
City." L. A. Larsen contributed "Thy
King Rodney" as a bass solo.
The background showed a forest scene
and a portion of a tree was represented
with an ax as though it had just been
struck down inio the great stump.
On the stage was a monument with the
inscription, "In Memory of Our Departed
Neighbors. Dum Tacet Clamat."
Memorial services of the Woodmen of the
World were performed yesterday at the
Alhambfa Theatre. Many hundreds came
to participate in the exercises in memory
of deceased "neighbors" of woodcraft and
the ceremony throughout was deeply im
pressivel

"My two little girls are Btaying at pres
ent with my sister, Mrs. J.\T. Merritt. at
the camp and my reason for, coming to
San Francisco is to get some things for
them," he said. "I have only my children
to live- for now. My life is blighted. My
wife, if left alone, would be content and
willing to do as I wish, and I know her
famiJy in the Transvaal will support me.
For the sake of my family and for the
sake of hers I hope the truth of this
whole sad business may never have to be
brought to light."
Dr. Anthony denied that he had ever
been cruel to his wife. He said she loved
him to-day and that he had a great friend
ship for her and had promised her. in
writing that he would take care of her
always to the best of his ability and
proyide for her.
Mrs. Anthony, he affirmed, had never
been insane, but she had always been
very excitable and of a nervous disposi
tion, and the knowledge of the divorce
had preyed upon her mind.
Mrs. Anthony's so-called friends, Pr.
Anthony declared, were at the bottom of
the notoriety given to the case and he
felt sure that the time would come when
Mcs. Anthony would find out that those
she. considered were her friends were in
reality -her worst enemies. <Â¦.";.Â»'*-?*,
In an interview last night at the house
of his sister, Mrs. J. T. Merritt. at S13
Oak street" Dr. Anthony said that he
regretted very deeply that the so-calied
friends of Mrs. Anthony should have
thought fit to rush into print. He de
nounced their statements as "rot" and
lies. He stated that he had filed his com
plaint for divorce on the grounds of deser
Â¥ on in order to cover up the graver
I aarges, ot which he had positive proof
Lnd which he trusted would never have
Lo be aired in court.
j Anthony said he did not believe Mrs.
,'Anthony would appear in court to defend
(the case and that he would take no
' further steps in the matter at Â¦ present,
but would wait for his wife" to move.
Should she appear, however, then, to pro
tect himself and his good name he would
have to make known the whole storyl
"The facts are brietly these," said Dr.
Anthony. '"I came back from my hor
rible experiences in South Africa expect
ing to be united with my famil-v in a
happiness 1 had not known for years.
On arriving^ in Chicago I heard news about
rny wife that was confirmed on my ar
rival in San Francisco. My wife was in
a very weak state, both mentally and
physically, and I suggested that a month
in the sanitarium would be beneficial to
her. I never told her, that when she came
out we would live comfortably with the
children. What I did say was this, that
if, during the six months elapsing, after
our divorce she conducted herself in such
a manner that I considered her the proper
person to look after our children I would
let her have them to bring up. I have
been very charitable to her in making
the ground one of desertion instead of al
leging something far more discreditable."
!? Dr. Richard B. Anthony, who has filed
a complaint for divorce against his wife,
Mrs. Christina J. Anthony, on the grounds
of desertion, arrived in San Francisco last
night from Petaluma, where he has been
attending the camp meeting of the Sev
enth Day Adventists.
Doctor Denies the State
ments Made by His
Wife's Friends.
When only 20 he wrote a play called "A
Kentucky Hero," which was first pro
duced at Santa Barbara, and subsequently
all over the United States. Some one said
at the time that his father, ex-Judge Fer
ral of this city, wrote the first act to the
play, but Judge Ferral states positively
that his son wrote it all himself. Robert
wrote several other pieces, one of which,
"Little Miss Jealousy," was produced
with success in Philadelphia,- New York
and Boston. He held the position of press
agent at Keith's until his death. He was
about to be appointed assistant manager
of Keith's at Philadelphia. '
Robert Jefferson Ferral was near his
twenty-fifth birthday when he ended his
own life. His parents are almost pros
trated with grief. The body will be
brought to this city for interment.
He graduated from the Lowell: High
School and entered Hastfng's College of
Law, but quit there .to take up literary
work. He secured a position on The Call,
which he held for a year and a half, writ
ing and often illustrating his own sto
ries. He left The Call to take a position at
Keith's Theatre In New York.
ROBERT J. FERRAL, the young,
press -agent and playwright,' of
whose sad death in Philadelphia
word was received Saturday night,
would have undoubtedly developed
into a brilliant writer h,ad he , lived. Â¦ He"
Â¦was always a brilliant scholar,' having
graduated from the Pacific Heights school
with the highest honors. "While yet- a boy
he delivered an address at a flag presenta
tion to the school. His first s appearaijce
on the stage was at the Grand Opera
House at the graduating exercises,- when
he represented the character of President
Harrison, bringing forth much comment
on his realistic work.

"LIES AND ROT"

â¢Mr. Reed then spoke, of the telephone
system,*'. Its. faults '.and. poor service to the
public. : '_:Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦ .-Â¦.,'Â¦Â¦Â¦ v v-v.;
: Reed called the attention of the city offi
cials and the Grand Judy to this. state of
affairs. iThe: books. of tHe. Post, he said,
showed the payments made.
'. But ."the most -convincing proof that I have
to offer, on; the subject' of Â¦ the -corrupt 'prac
tices of the Bulletin is the fact that Its pro
prietor â¢ has had his hands in the city treas
ury for the last year and has been fraudulently
and feloniously stealing the city funds. The
charter requires that the public printing shall
be" let ~ to a " newspaper ' having -. at ' least 8000
dally circulation. Last year there were only
the Post and Â¦" Bulletin which could ' compete.
The' price formerly was 28 cents an Inch. Last
year : the Post bid 58 cents an inch and the
Bulletin " Â¦ much â¢ higher. - Upon - - receiving the
personal assurance of the representatives of
the Post and Bulletin that the printing could
not be done for lens, and that there' was no col
lusion in the bids, the Supervisors awarded the
contract to the Post at 58 cents an Inch." When
the Post changed hands, a few months ago it
Â¦was ; found that theâ Bulletin was being paid
18 . cents - for every inch of printing \ that was
being I done . by . the Post. , : In â¢ other words, the
Bulletin fraudulently conspired with its osten
sible rival to rob the city, and feloniously re
ceived ' nearly $5000 ' of the people's money be
fore the plot was. exposed. .
EXPOSES POST'S METHODS.
Â¦ The Emporium refused 'to submit to the de
mands of the Bulletin and withdrew what I lit
tle advertising . It had formerly given to* that
sheet. â¢ Crothers straightway emptied the vials
of his. wrath upon the Emporium. -7
Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦ One of . the editors of the 'Bulletin "some
time, since went - to the manager . of the Em
porium and demanded advertisement ' to . the
extent' of $5000, and . being refused, threatened
to use the- political pull of the paper to pro
cure adverse legislation,, which would- cost the
store more than $5000. "
Â¦ The practice of the Bulletin in ! levying
blackmail-,. upon political candidates to pur
chase immunity from its attacks is well known
In political circles, but Its career in the busi
ness world 'ia even more outrageous. Its prac
tice has been to solicit advertising matter, and
then send, a .bill for more, than the contract
â¢prictfj-,- A refusal. to. pay was met by a threat
of being roasted. Another . practice was to get
a large amount of "write-ups" from \ business
houses upon the agreement that only a nom
inal rate- should he exacted, as the purpose of
the Bulletin, was to boom the .town. But the
unlucky merchants were afterward 'presented
with a bill at the highest rates. - So flagrant
was the Â¦ conduct of Mr. Â¦'" Crothers' gang that
Mr. " Dohrmann, ex-presldent of the Merchants'
'Association, was compelled to call a meeting
of merchants â¢ in order to take measures to
'. reislst blackmail at the hands . of ! the ' Bulletin.
CHARGES a BLACKMAIL.
I In the last campaign for Mayor the Bulle- I
tin first came out for Tobin. It demanded
110,000 from the Phelan machine for the con- i
tinuance of that support, but as the price was
thought rather, high for such weight as the
"Boodllng Bulletin" had to give, that thrifty
paper went over to the other side. The
amount of boodle promised and paid by the
united corDorations of San Francisco for the
support of the Â¦ Bulletin for Wells I was $7500 â
an extravagant price for such a . turn-coat Â¦ and
blatherskite. . , -:
Mr.' Crothera struck a barerain with a can
didate for another office, at satisfactory terms
to each, but a few days later informed the
candidate that his rival offered more money
and so the' deal was oft." In another Instance
the proof of an article severely reflecting- upon
a ' candidate for office- and " accusing - him ; of
moral dellnquincles was shown, to the candi
date, and he was told that if â¢ he would pay
a certain amount to the Bulletin the article
would, be suppressed and his election advo
cated.' The candidate submitted to the black
mailer, paid the. money and was elected to the
office which he- now- holds, j
BUIiliETIN CHANGES SIDES.
The Bulletin strongrly supported the late la
mented leader of reform in San Francisco for
many- years,- then its indorsement became
weaker, and finally turned into a blackmail
ing roast. The statesman's explanation of the
Bulletin's change of heart has become famous..
It was, '"the lease has expired."
In the campaign- for District Attorney three
years; ago the Bulletin took money from the
backers of the Republican and Democratic
nominees - for that office and supported each
with monetary impartiality in the same issues
of its paper. â¢ . '
The' speaker said he had on .a previous
occasion given numerous specific examples
of blackmail and corrupt practices on the
part of the Bulletin. He went on:
Do you -not remember President Harriman's
speech at a recent banquet at the Palace Ho
tel, when he said that his company would soon
ask for large terminal privileges, and he hoped
it would not' be compelled to resort to "ques
tionable means" in order to obtain ' them?
What did President Harriman mean if not that
his . company was prepared to corrupt the pub
lic servants and bribe them to betray the peo
ple? He is not the only man that has blabbed
at a banquet. When President Harriman
uses "questionable means" we must pillory the
men who take his money, 6Y the money of any
other corporation. His company used "ques
tionable means" last year when the Bulletin
was bribed to support the railroad ticket. The
Bulletin had become a corrupt sheet. It will
betray, anybody or any cause for coin.
If the people Â¦ would . take over each fran
chise as .It expires and opeiate , the system
themselves, in thirty years' time there would
not be a single private railroad in the city and
the people would own property which the specu
lators estimate to be worth $80,000,000. - The
first- franchise to fall in would be that of the
Geary-street' road, which expires In November,
1903. - -.-..;.
When " we look into the question ! of street
railways/then the needs of a Municipal Owner
ship League are apparent. . Â¦
. "Water costs the people here seven times as
much as' It does the people â¢ of New- York.
COSTLY WATER.
Charles "Wesley; Reed delivered an ad
dress last night at the Academy of Sci
ences before a crowded audience. The sub
jectof the address was "Municipal Own
ership," and the lecturer was frequently
applauded.
He said that friends of public ownership
were in the fight to win against all the
corporate bodies of San Francisco. To
win the citizens must organize a municipal
ownership league, which should never rest
until. the city owned and operated all of
Its public utilities. Fifty thousand dollars
had been spent by the City Engineer and
the Board of -Public Works, he said, "and
still plans Â¦and estimates of the r cost of
the various" utilities provided for By. the
charter had not been submitted. These
officials, he declared, were frittering away
the years while- the enemies of municipal
ownership were intrenching themselves
with additional franchises. He continued:
Were there a municipal league with a mem
bership of 10,000 demanding: that these reports
bÂ«* in they would have all- been placed on file
long ago and a vote on the question of ac
quiring- . their own water supply could have
been had Â¦ by the people. These engineers' re
ports so far place the cost of the water-supply
millions of dollars higher Â¦ than any other en
gineers' estimates; they have selected the most
difficult routes, have refused to pass upon the
shortest ' and most obvious one, and . have re
fused to examine one of the best water sup
plies that is obtainable, the north fork of the
American River. Many engineers of the high
est standing | have assured the Supervisors that
the City engineer's figures' are ' too high by
millions. ' Â¦"â¢Â¦Â¦ â¢
