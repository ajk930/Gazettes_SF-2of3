While all Texas seemed to have been

120 Injured, many of whom
will die. Is the dread record
of a tornado that swept Goliad to-day.
To-night the scene that is spread out be
fore the survivors is one of appalling de
struction. Between Church and Patrice
streets, which run north and couth a
distance of a mile in length, only one
house is left standing, and of many struc
tures scarcely a vestige remains. Very
little damage was done except â¢ within
these boundaries, a width of 250 yards.
The tornado was, preceded a few mo
ments by a heavy hailstorm and a deep
rumbling sound, but no one had any pre
monition of the disaster, and there was
no opportunity for escape. The. death
dealing cyclone struck the town and
passed on, and only a few seconds were
required in the completion of Its awful
work.
BUT ONE BUILDING , SPARED.
The section which most suffered was
the residence portion, the lower part be
ing the negro settlement, while the upper
part contained many fine residences. The
Methodist and Baptist churches and the
Baptist parsonage, both just completed,
and the negro Methodist church were de
stroyed. The Episcopal church was bad
ly damaged, and fully 100 houses were
utterly demolished. . The stone residence
of D. T. Davis of the Goliad Guard was
the only building in the pathway of the
storm not reduced to splinters, and it is
a wreck.
The people of Goliad, realizing at once
the stupendous nature of the calamity
and the terrible loss of life, telephoned to
their sister cities of Cuero and Victoria
for assistance, which was sent immedi
ately. General Superintendent Forbes
stopped the regular Beeville train at Gol

it brought six doctors and an abundance
of medicines and surgical appliances. An
other train came later from Cuero with
a number of physicians, dozens of nurses
and many citizens.

HAZLETON, Pa., May 18.â The _yisit
of Ralph M. Easley, secretary of the^Na
tionaj Civic Federation, to strike head
quarters, and his conference with Presi
dent Mitchell of the United Mine Workers
last night, was the only incident of any
importance that claimed the attention to
day of the labor leaders and others around
the Valley Hotel. As neither Easley
nor Mitchell would say anything regard
ing their meeting, there waa much specu
lation as to the object of the visit of the
secretary of the Civic Federation.
-Easley laughed at the. stir which his ar
rival caused, and said there was not the
slightest significance attached to his trip
here. . He reiterated . that he came here
merely to. look over the ground and to
keep himself Informed of the general sit
uation. He denied that he brought any
plan for the settlement of the strike or
any message from Senator Hanna or any
other member of the Civic Federation.
Easley said he carried -no message back
with him from Mitchell. His talk with the
miner's national president last night
lasted two hours. He again saw Mitchell
for a few minutes this morning- and left
for New York at 10 o'clock this morning.
Despite the denials of the labor leaders
the members of the Civic Federation and
the coal operators, all of whom have thus
far rigidly adhered to the policy of ab
solutely refusing to anticipate any move
ment in connection with the strike it is
believed here that the federation is
quietly preparing to receive any propo
sition that might possibly be offered bv

that the crew were obliged to turn their

"Fire was still burning about the ship

tain decided to try to reach the island of.
St. Lucia, forty miles distant. This he
succeeded in doing by 6 o'clock on the
evening of May 8. The steamer was diffi

exhausted and scalded, struggled to do
something to assist their dyfcig shipmates.
Those working below strived to keep up

greatest agony, succeeded In navigating

W.. WASHINGTON, May IS.â Officials of
the Department of Justice greeted The
Call's .latest contribution to the cass of
the United States vs. the Beef Trust with
expressions of pleasure and gratification.
It was pointed out that the letters, more
clearly than any that have been pub
lished before, reveal the existence of a
combination. Repeated references to the
territory that is to be conducted on
"tight lines" and by the "tight agree
ment" show that the combination had
hard and fast agreements under which
it did business.

Hanna also knows that five or six rail
roads financed by J. Pierpont Morgan and
the Vanderbilts control 90 per cent of the
anthracite coal fields and absolutely con
trol the business. As president of the
Civic Federation Hanna cannot engage in
talks with obdurate mine operators, but
he can still do something in that line as
an individual who know all the secrets of
the coal business and something of poli
tics. Hanna knows the real causes of this
trouble and Morgan knows that he knows.
There will be an effort to bring out thi3
information, and it would not injure the
cause of the miners If it became public.
The mine operators seem to think they
have Hanna safely bottled up in the Civic
Federation, where he can do nothing save
offer to arbitrate. It remains to be seen
whether their judgment is correct. Just
after the election in. 1900 Hanna made a
speech to a score or more of the great
captains of industry in New York. It was
at a private dinner and the speeches were
not reported In the newspapers. But Han
na's speech was considered sensational in
that select audience, coming. from one of
their number.' He told them the country
was enjoying such prosperity as it never
had enjoyed before and it would continue.
But he reminded them that the humble
laborers were not getting their share of
this prosperity and that this condition
would not- long be tolerated without pro
ducing great unrest. They must so con
duct their business as 'to make alt labor
ers, even the most humble, feel there
was prosperity in the land. Hanna still
holds the. views he "expressed In 1900 and
he will no doubt use his personal influence
to that end. , . .
This is all Senator/Hanna, president of
the National Civic Federation, will say.
But Hanna as an individual or rather as
chairman of the National Republican
Committee brought the mine operators to
terms in 1900, 'when there was a similar
strike' in the anthracite fields, and the
Senator is not barred from using his per
sonal and political influence now because
the efforts of the National Civic Federa
tion have failed! He believes now, as be
did in 1900, that the miners have just
grievances and that the operators are
wrong. He knows that the excuses of the
operators for refusing to grant, the'in
crease to the miners are not valid.

SAN PEDRO, May 18.â On one of the
roughest voyages in the history of the
passenger steamer Warrior, which ar
rived here from Avalon, Catallna Island,
three hours latey S. S. Knight, a conduc
tor in^he employ of the San Pedro, Los
and Salt Lake road, was washed
overboard and lost. J. C. Herrick of
Spokane, Wash., leaped overboard , at
the same time, but was saved after he
roic efforts of the crew.
The 115 passengers praise Captain Dris
coll.and the efficient work done by him
and his crew in the manner of hand
ling his ship and his conduct in the work
of rescue.
The strong gale that swept the coast
all day stirred up the sea to an unusual
extent, and the waves rolled almost
mountain high. The Warrior is a small
vessel, and 'when Bhe left the island for
San Pedro at 4 o'clock this afternoon. at
once plunged into a heavy s^a. The pas
sengers on board were nearly all in a
state of helplessness from seasickness.
About half way across the channel the
waves began to break clean over the hur
ricane deck of the Warrior, and many
passengers were in a state of panic, me
vessel's crew did 'all in their power to
allay the fears of the passengers, and
were fairly successful.^ '
Knight was standing on the hurricane
deck, when an unusually heavy sea broke
over the boat from stem to stern. He was
lilted off his feet and carried overboard.
He disappeared immediately. ;
Herrick became separated from his wife,
and seeing a woman's hat floating on the
water believed she had been washed over
board. He leaped into the sea, only to
discover his mistake. Herrick was res
cued by the crew after much difficulty.

General Davis reports that Datto Ruty '
says he is ready to fight, but General
Chaffee believes that, although It may .;
be necessary to bring this Dattp to terms, ' ;
his resistance of the American forces
N must necessarily be slight.
Datto Ruty's forta are situated on a
high hill. They could be surrounded by
a line of American skirmishers, who -
would prevent the Datto obtaining water
and who could thus force a practically,
bloodless victory i|Â» a few days.
In view of a cablegram which General '
Chaffee received to-day 'from General .1
Davis, who is commander of the Arnqri- j
can forces in Mindanao, and In Which it -
appears that Datto Ruty has apparently
refused to return the animals he captured
from the American army, . General Chaf
fee Is not prepared to say that there will
be no more fighting In Mindanao. . :

Ingâ Gentlemen: I had a ; mild form of

dropsy set in. Later in the month I re~ |
signed my position and on February 8th _.
two of our best physicians said I was in
its last stages, had but a short time to
' live and to close my business affairs. I
saw your ad in the paper, stating a neigh-
bor had been cured of Bright's Disease by
your Renal Compound. My wife went to
see her. She said: "Yes, take it at once. !
It saved my life after five physicians said-
I could not live." I was most encouraged,
went intx> Ferry Drug Co. They said:
Fulton's Renal Compound? Â¦ .
â¢â¢Yes, we know all about t it, and can
recommend it as being a wonderful cure
for Bright's Disease." I bought it, have
taken eleven bottles, and I am so much Â¦

am better in every way. I gladly make *
this statement. Publish it anywhere. '

WASHINGTON, May 18.â The deprecia

European powers that China meet her ob

the indemnity for tho Boxer by
93,000,000 Haikwan taels. equivalent to al
most $70,000,000. Thus in order to satisfy
the demands of the nations which inter
vened in the empire in 1900 the Peking
Government will have to raise the sum
of 500,000,000 Haikwan taela, instead of
450.000,000, the sum originally fixed by the
powers. Should the powers .Insist that
tho indemnity be paid In gold and th3
value of silver continues to decline the

ABE DUTX AND INACTIVE
Coroner Jackson was informed that
Miss Williams was engaged to be married
to Pitts Duffleld of this city, a son of
General -P.. G. Duffleld of Detroit, and
that Duffield was at the hotel when Miss
Williams died, she having had him sum
moned.
The young woman and her mother had
been spending the winter at Saranac
Lake, York, on account of the poor
health of the daughter. Before leaving
Saranac Lake for New York City a phy
sician had prescribed strychnine pills for
Miss Williams, and the orders were that
she should take five before meals. She
was also given pills containing iron,
which were to be taken after meals. On
arising to-day she remarked to her maid
that she was feeling better, and then
went to breakfast. It seems from what
Coroner Jackson could gather that Miss
Williams, after she went again to her
room, took several of the strychnine pill3,
probably mistaking them for^the iron
pills. The death is put down a>of a pure
ly accidental character.
NEW YORK, May 18.â Miss Julia Wil
lis ms, aged 22 years, daughter of Mrs.
Julia Williams of Detroit, Mich., and said
to be a relative of Senator Hanna, died
to-day at the Fifth Avenue Hotel' of an
overdose, of strychnine taken in the form
of pills.
After finishing the naval bill this week
the House will take up the bill reported
from the Committee on Foreign Affairs
relating to passports. One day will be
devoted to claims, the regular day for
that business last week having been post
poned. Under a special order a bill for
the restriction of immigration will be
taken up and it Is expected will cause
quite a lively debate. There also is a
prospect of taking up the Hill bill reJat-
Ing to subsidiary coinage. This measure
will be strongly antagonized by the mi
nority and may precipitate a discussion
of the currency question. Early in the
week the Committee on Rules will hold a
meeting to decide whether or not time
shall be given for the consideration of
the bill for a Pacific cable.
WASHINGTON, May IS.â The entire
time of the Senate for the present week
will be devoted to the consideration of
the Philippine government bill and there
are hopes that debate on that measure
will be completed before the end of the
week. The fact that there will be an ad
journment of the Senate covering next
Saturday, in order to permit that body to
participate in the unveiling of the Roch
ambeau statue, probably will have the
effect of postponing the final vote until
the following Monday or Tuesday. There
is, however, no longer doubt in any quar
ter that the minority will permit a vote
as soon as the debate on the bill shall be
exhausted. Under the present arrange
ment the bill will occupy most all the
time of the Senate this week, and the
prospects are against the sandwiching in
of much other business. Speeches in sup
port of the* bill are promised by. Senators
Burrows, Dolliver and Spoor er and in op
position to it by Senators Hoar, Bacon,
Patterson and others.

' AN EXCITING DEBATE
I The Deputy District Attorney during his
address to the jury referred to the ac
cused In terms so uncomplimentary that
' the court on one o^ two occasions had to
admonish him. He called Williams a
hypocritical biped and other terms, all of
which the accused took with good grace,
leaning back in his chair with his leg-*
crossed.
The jury after a deliberation of three
hours returned a verdict of not guilty.
That woman, gentlemen, was trying to
blackmail me. She wanted to get me into her
house tor that- purpose, and I was afraid of
her. â¢ That's the reason I moved away from
there. I was almost afraid of my life. She
is a tigress, and any man would be afraid of
the woman. I am innocent, gentlemen, of any
intentional wrongdoing in this matter, and I
hope you will obey the dictates of justice by
acquitting me.
LOS ANGELES, May 18.-John Wil
liams, accused of beating Helen W. CoÂ«
of Long Beach, addressed the jury yester

the nature of a confidential confab with
the jury. Said he:

This move was objected to and constant

reached a crisis, for one morning the Pet

vestigation was made and the bodies of
the wife, mother and father were found In
the ruins. There were unmistakable ev

all appearances a double-bitted ax was the
weapon used. The murderer had then set
the building on fire and fled.

TACOMA, "Wash., May 18.â To-day's
Alaska mail contains meager particulars
of a tragedy which occurred near Wran
gle, May 7. A correspondent writing- to
the Juneau Dispatch tells- this story: Â¦
White Man in the North Destroys
Domestic Relations by Triple
Crime. "
WIFE AND HER PARENTS
A MURDERER'S VICTIMS
Within three days there have been two
murders committed in Castroville and the
citizens are excited almost to the verge of
adopting desperate measures to maintain
a better respect for the law. The appall
ing tragedy to-day has called forth a
feeling, bitter and ominous In its In
tensity.
It is known that McCarthy did some
drinking in Castroville this morning:, ,but
he was not intoxicated. He is said to be
a youth of quick temper and he had been
arrested before for slight offenses.
The body of the mother was found ly
ing ujkm the floor of the sitting-room in
the cottage where the McCarthy family
had lived for years. From the position of
the body and the powder-bumed condition
of wounds, it is presumed that the mother
had been stricken to the ground, and
while lying on the floor was fatally shot.
The first known of the affair was dis
closed by the matricide who walked into
the office of T. P. Clark, Justice of tho
Peace of Castroville, and surrendered him
self. He was taken in charge by Sheriff
Keefe and brought to the County Jail
here. The Inquest will be held to-morrow.
The boy Â«vho is allttle : over 20 years of
age, returned from San Francisco yester
day, where he is employed as a janitor in
the Mills building. No known trouble had
existed between the mother and son. Mc-
Carthy Is a native of Castroville. whero
his father, Cornelius McCarthy, has re
sided many years with his wife and three
children, some of whom have married
and settled In the county. The murderer
lived here up to a couple of years ago and
since that time has frequently returned.
At the time of the crime he was perfectly
sober.
Four shots from a revolver were fired by
the murderer Into his victim's head at
close range. All of the bullets entered tho
right side of the hear* near the ear, and
death was instantaneous.
SALINAS, May 18.â John McCarthy shot
his mother to death at noon to-day at her
home in Castroville. The circumstances
of the tragedy have not yet been
learned, as the murderer and his victim.
were alone and the young man who com
mitted the crime refused to speak except
to acknowledge the deed and claim that
he acted in self-defense.
Special Dlsuatch to The Can.
Scrae of the lawyers decided to see the
Attorney General, who is in the city, and
point out to him that no one had a right
to maintain a private prison. Others fol
lowed them and then the police cleared
the corridors. Orders were given to city
detectives to watch every loiterer In or
near the hotel and to keep all moving.
Crowds gathered in Dominion Square,
opposite the hotel, expecting a scene at
any moment
It was an exciting moment, particularly
as strange men appeared in different
parts of the corridor and looked suspi
ciously at the crowd near the prisoners'
rooms. The arguments grew so heated
and the situation so serious that the po
lice lined up across the corridor and de
clared no man should pass them. Judge
Lafontaine was loudly denounced by sev
eral persons for sitting on Sunday, while
others shouted thar he was doing his
duty well. \
Judge Lafontaine said he would go in
and see the prisoners, but Inspector JMac-
Mahon shoved him <J)ack, and, backed
up by nine other men, shouted defiance
to the Judge or lawyer who dared to trv
to set into the rooms. The police de"
clared nothing would be stopped at if
the proposed rescue was tried in earnest.
Mr. Lemieux, crown prosecutor, said he
had no objections, but Senator Dandu
rand, acting for the United States, de
nounced the statement of a plot as a
lalsehood. It was then declared, amid
great excitement, that the reverse was
the case and that the excuse of placing
the prisoners in the jail simply meant
that as soon as the men were out of the
door of the hotel, hired men, hiding near
by, would spring upon the party and
drive them to a safe place.
The clash came about over > a rumor
that the prisoners' friends had a deep
laid plan to rescue them- It was neces
sary to get the prisoners out of the hotel
and so Judge J^afontaine was sent for
and told that an important point was to
l>e argued. Followea by a dozen lawyers
the Judfre went to the corridor, and,
within hfty feet of th. rooms occupied by
Gaynor and Green, opened court. Law
yers for the defense declared that they
knew of a plot on the part of the United
States authorities to kitinap the men at
iiight and hustle them out of tne country
in the same way that they had been
brought from CJuebec to Montreal. Mr.
Tascnereau demanded that his clients be
a.L once remove* to the common jail,
where they could be safely locked up.
MONTREAL, Quebec. May 18.â There
Â¦was an exciting scene in the corridor of
the fifth floor of the Windsor Hotel this
afternoon, when, for the first time in
Canada, within the recollection of law
yers, the hotel was turned into a court
of Justice on a Sunday afternoon. This
remarkable event was followed by a de
tei mined effort on the part of friends of
John F. Gaynor and Benjamin D. Green
to gain forcible entrance to their rooms.
Ten of the stoutest officers of the Mon
treal police force stood guard over the
prisoners, and when Mr. Taschereau, the
prisoners' counsel, tried to get through
their line he met with anything but po
lite treatment.

Magoon declares that the "rights" rec
ognized by the protocols entered into by
Spain, Germany and Great Britain were
those constituting the sovereignty and
he flnds himself unable to agree with the
Embassador that the Spanisn sovereignty
was not recognized and internationally
established. Magoon says the restric
tions upon trade imposed by the military
government were due to the opinion of
the commander of the military forces en
gaged in the suppression of the insurrec
tion and that there was a military neces
sity therefor. The sovereignty of the
United States being established, recog
nized and submitted to -throughout tile
archipelago the nation will continue to
exercise its war powers thereover and
the peace powers will be exercised when
ever the conditions of peace prevail
The Drovisions of the protocols entered Into
by Germany. Grep.t Britain and Ssain In 1S77
and 18S5 constituted a grant creatine a per
petual easement in favor of Germany, Great
Britain and the other powers, which is a servi
tude upon the Sulu archipelago, diminishes the
fee thereof, and remains attached thereto. If
the rights secured to Germany and Great
Britain and the other powers by the protocols
are not vested by a grant, then they are rights
derived from the contract between the re
spective sovereignties of Spain, Germany and
Great Britain, which contract was in force
at the time the United States acquired sov
ereignty over the archipelago, and the obli
gations of the contract, incumbent on Spain,
passed to and became binding upon the United
States.
The United States did not acquire sover
eignty over the Sulu archii>elago by conquest
thereof, nor was the sovereignty there ever
confirmed unto the United States by the
treaty of Paris for the reason that Spain had
never acquired sovereignty in the said archi
pelago, nor was Spanish sovereignty therein
recognized and internationally established. *
The question raised by Germany as to
the sovereignty of the United States over
the Sulu islands was presented by the
German Embassador, who declared that
the military government in the Philip
pines was without the authority to reg
ulate, restrict or prohibit trade with the
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. In
support of this contention the Embassa
dor advanced these propositions:-

On the coffee question a lady says: "I
used to be so miserable after breakfast
that I did not know how to get through
the day. Life was a burden to me.
When I tried to sleep I was miserable
by having horrible dreams followed by
hours of wakefulness. Gas would rise
on my stomach and I would belch almost
continually. Then every few weeks I
would have a long siege of sick head-
aches. I tried a list of medicines and
physicians without benefit,
"Finally I concluded to give up my cof-
fee and tea altogether and use' Postum
Coffee. The first cup was a failure. Jt
was wishy-washy, and I offered to give
the remainder of the package to any one
who would take it. >
"I noticed later on In one of the adver-
tisements that Postum should be boiled
at least fifteen minutes to make it good. I
rsked the cook how she made It and she
f aid, 'Just the same as I did tea, being
careful not to let it steep too lonr.'

Postum bad not had a fair trial, so - we
made a new lot and boiled It fifteen or
twenty minutes. That time It came to
the table a different beverage and was so
delicious that we have been using it ever

The Philippine debate affords a good opportunity
for high oratory in the Senate, but up to' this time it
has been rather rank than; high.
It is to be regretted that Mrs. Johnson's great age
and weakness forbid her to accept, the invitation.
They, however, interpose 1 obstacles that cannot be
overcome, and the royal return for democratic hos
pitality can go no further than the issue of the invi
tation and the manifestation of a grateful recollection.
The invitation manifests a grateful memory of
courtesies shown long ago. When, in i860, Edward,
whd was then Prince of Wales, visited this country,
James Buchanan was President of the United States,
and his niece, Miss Harriet Lane, presided at the
White House." The Prince was received and. enter
tained there with all the hospitality and cordiality
that has ever marked American democracy in its re
ception of the representatives of great. and friendly
nations. Through all the years that. have intervened
Edward has kept the recollection of his American
hosts, and now that he is King heinvitcs his hostess
of the old time to come and accept a return of her
hospitality.
KING EDWARD did a gracious thing when
he insisted that on coronation day his wife
should be crowned also, sb that she will be not
merely a Queen consort, but a veritable, .legally rec
ognized and crowned Queen, even as heV himself is
King. He has now shown an equal graciousness in
sending, under his own signature, a special invitation
to Mrs. Harriet L'ane Johnson to attend the corona
tion ceremonies at Westminster as a guest of his
household. ; . . .-

in the capacity of godmother > for the in

.This is a new role for Mrs. Fish, though
she Is ever the pink of propriety. No mat
ter how unforunately enthusiastic her

casional dinner, Mrs. Fish never forgets
her reserve and dignity. She seems to
feel that the weight of New York so
ciety Is upon her shoulders, and that she

features as betting for the sake of adding
new zest to an old game.
On the Pacific Coast the conditions are uniformly
cheerful. Everything the coast produces seems to be
wanted in some quarter of the world, and, with one
or two exceptions, there is no dullness reported in
any line of business. An especially gratifying feature
is the current advance in all the leading grains, which
cannot but favorably affect trade. Wheat has gone up
considerably during the past fortnight and the demand
for it is now first rate. Barley and oats are steadily
advancing under light supplies and a good and in
creasing inquiry. AH the available corn has been
bought up by a San Francisco firm, which is mark
ing up quotations every day or so. Hides are higher
ind dairy produce is moving off well at quotations
above the average at this time of the year. Dried
fruit is so cleaned up that most lines are practically
exhausted. Salmon is in better demand and canned
fruits ami vegetables are also meeting with an im
proved inquiry. Wool alone is dull, but this is due
to the Eastern strikes, which have checked the ope
rations of buyers, and the undertone of the market
is one of firmness. The abundance of money is well
illustrated by the promptness with which the offer
ing of $5,000,000 of 4 per cent bonds of the United
Railroads of San Francisco were taken up, the whole
line being absorbed in a single day, with so many
surplus orders received that the larger subscriptions'
will have to be scaled down to accommodate the
smaller ones. Thus, whatever may be the condition
of trade-in other parts of the country, the Pacific
Coast is enjoying a period of prosperity which shows
no signs of cessation. In brief, times were never
better in California than they are to-day.
The staples were more or less irregular. Wheat
advanced and the minor cereals were also firm and
pointing upward, with the exception of corn, which
was weaker, with more disposition on the part of the
Western farmers to let go. Hides were very
strong and more active. Provisions were unsettled,
but ruled firm at a slight advance. The woolen
goods trade showed rather more life, but the cotton
export trade was dull. Footwear was reported in
good demand in the West, but dull along the more
densely populated Atlantic seaboard. Thus it will
be seen that considered as a whole the trade of the
country was decidedly irregular last week, firmness
in some lines being offset by weakness in others, this
condition prevailing everywhere except on the Pa
cific Coast. As far as the bank clearings given above
show, the net result was rather unfavorable than
otherwise.
*-t-Â»RADE again showed signs of irregularity and
1 hesitation last week. How much of this was
â¢*â¢ due to the coal strike is impossible to say at
the moment, but judging from the commercial senti
ment throughout the country, as indicated by the
press dispatches, the strike has already had the -ef
fect of checking a good deal of business which
otherwise would have been done. If the walkout
extends all over the country, as intimated by the
leaders, it is feared that not only the iron and steel
trades, already handicapped by scarcity of material,
but the railroads as well, will be tied up, in which
case the loss to the country's business will be enor
mous. The apprehension of this possible condition
caused a weak feeling in Wall street at the close of
the week, especially as everybody had previously
been assured that there would be no strike, hence the
tinal announcement of the walkout came as an un
pleasant surprise. Another unfavorable feature was
the announcement that the wheat crop of the country
would fall below previous estimates, owing to the
recent dry weather in the Southwest and to wet
weather in the Northwest, the latter having materi
ally delayed seeding and curtailed the wheat acreage
in that section. Still another bearish feature to gen
eral business was the decline in the country's bank
clearings, which showed a loss of 30.8 per cent, as
compared with the same week last year, while the
aggregated clearingvfell to $2,384,492,000, the small
est total for several weeks. The failures were 228,
against 177 for the same week last year.

The stately ceremonies, .which were conducted
largely upon medieval 1 models, were disturbed for a

gave notice of the disturbed- and discontented condi

from the crowd and tried to present a petition to the
King. It was at once assumed that an attempt at
assassination had been made, and while an investiga

made known reveals how conscious the Spanish peo

Â¦Massachusetts papers are indignant j because the
Governor of Arkansas pardoned a negro on condi
tion that he should go to-; Massachusetts, and yet it
is not long ago .that The Call had occasion to. note
the action of a Massachusetts Judge who permitted
a criminal in that State to go free on condition that
he would come to California.. .. '.'. : .,.''-. ; ...
Gage, by the assistance of Dan Kevane, may be a
fairly successful practitioner in the criminal courts,
but he is unfitted to be Governor of California. He
has no regard for the duties of the office and no re
spect for its responsibilities. He desires the place
merely that he may use it for the advantage 'of his
friends and his # friends are predatory politicians^, who
are not at all scrupulous how they plunder' the State.'
Here, then, are two specimens of Gage's adminis
tration. They show the kind of men to whom Gage
intrusts the management of the affairs of the State
while he is attending to Herrin's^schemes. and doing
politics with the bosses whom Herrin controls. When
added to the list of other offenses which have been
exploited from time to time it win be seen that Gage
ends his term as he began it, with a scandalous dis
regard for the public welfare. .
The violations of the specifications occur at points
that threaten to affect the value of the whole work.
For the purpose of guarding against the destructive
teredo, it is provided in the contract that the piers
shall be constructed upon what is known as the "cyl
inder concrete process," which consists in driving
large wooden cylinders into the mud, pumping out
the water and mud and. then filling. the cylinders with
concrete, so that when the teredo wears the wood
away the concrete will securely sustain the wharves.
It will be seen that if'the work be not carefully done
the concrete columns will be weak and worthless and
all the superstructure that rests upon them will be
endangered. In fact, some experts who have
watched the way in which the specifications are being
violated have, not hesitated to say they would not be
surprised if some day the wharves now being con
structed slip into the bay, causing an enormous dam
age to property and a" heavy loss of life:
The second revelation of The Call, published with
ample detail on Sunday, shows the gross mismanage
ment of the Gage officials in supervising work on the
water front. The specifications of the contracts for
constructing car ferry slips and ; piers ; have been
grossly violated in many important particulars un
der the very eyes of the officials charged with the
duty, of enforcing the contract, and seemingly with
the connivance of at least some of them.
It is clear from this transaction that somebody had
Kern County bonds which he or they wished to un
leoad before they were retired and found the Gage
officials ready and accommodating. It may have
been a mere case of incompetency, but it cannot be
denied that it looks like something worse.
The circumstances under which the purchase was
made render the transaction worse than appears on
the face. Not only did the bonds declare in express
terms that they were redeemable at any time before
maturity at the pleasure of the county, but the county
had actually taken steps. to redeem and retire them.
The question of their retirement had beea submitted
to the people and the people had voted in favor of
the proposition. The Board of Supervisors had ar
ranged for their, retirement. A question affecting the
legality of the' proceedings had been raised in the
courts and tried.. All those proceedings were of
record, and yet Gage's officials paid for the bonds the
high premiums that have been stated.;
The first of the two disclosures was made by The
Call on Saturday and consisted in the revelation that
Gage's outside law partner, Daniel Kevane, and Assist
ant Attorney General Post, acting as the State Board
of Examiners, purchased two lots of Kern County 6 per
cent bonds, which upon the face were redeemable, at
the pleasure of the county at any time at par with
accrued interest, and paid for each lot a heavy pre
mium. Thus, for one lot of fifty bonds, having a par
value of $50,000, they paid $61,061 66, and for the
second lot, having a par value of $37,000, they paid
$4S,i8s 63. The premium paid on the first lot over
and above par value and interest accrued was $10,290,
while that on the second lot was $8080 80. In less
than six months Kern County redeemed the bonds,
paying for them only their par value with the inter
est due, thus obtaining them for $16,637 29 less than
the State paid for them.
With many of the" bad acts of Gage's administra
tion the public has long been familiar. Recently,
however, The Call ha^ had occasion to reveal two
more of them and to disclose the fact that the public
is not yet fully aware of the extent of the incompe
tence or worse with which Gage and his allies have
mismanaged the affairs of the people. ,
FROM the first Gage's administration has been
a scandal and if it cannot be .said -to have
grown worse from month tp month it is only
because his very first action in "office, that of schem
ing and working with Billy Herrin to bring about
the election of Dan Burns, to the United States Sen
ate, was about as scandalous a job as is possible in
American politics. From that time on, however,
Gage has piled one offense upon another. He, has
made the .interests of the commonwealth subservient
to corporation bosses, has debauched the public ser
vice by filling it with political henchmen, has de
graded the normal schools and . charitable institu
tions of the State by' making theni a part of the spoils
of politics, has vetoed good measures providing for
the general welfare and approved bad ones, and, in
short, has entered readily into any kind of scheme
calculated to win him the support of the^bosses. and
corrupt corporations, through. whose aid he hopes to
dominate the Republican Convention and procure a
renomination.

The question of jurisdiction was. lsiter
taken before the Supreme Court of the
United States and a decision adverse to
Mrs. Botkin was rendered.
The case aroused the most Intense in
terest in this State and in the State of
Delaware. Mrs. Botkin was enamoured of
John P. Dunning, the San Francisco head
of the Associated Press, and it is alleged
she sent a box of poisoned candy to Mrs.
Dunning, who was in August, 1898, stop
ping with her father in Dover, Del. Her
sister, Mrs. Lelia H. Deane, was also a
guest of -her father at the time. \Both
Mrs. Dunning and Mrs. Deane ate a por
tion of the candy and death followed.
Mrs. Botkin was arrested, tried and con
victed, but owing to an error in the
Judge's charge to the jury she was grant
ed a new trial by the Supreme Court.
District Attorney, Byington said yester
day that he had held" a consultation with
Judge ' Cook Saturday, and v it was ar
ranged that the District Attorney should
make application to the Board 'of Super
visors to include in the annual estimates
a sum to cover the expenses of the wit
nesses from . Delaware. It is thought thi*
sum will be included, but if not, the
money will be forwarded, anyhow/ as un
der the general law the District Attorney
Is empowered to incur all necessary ex
penses in connection with a trial. - There
are about twenty witnesses and their ex
penses at the last trial amounted to about
$12,000.

HAD EVENTFUL CAREER.
William Taylor was born May 2, 1821,
In Rockbrldge County. Virginia. He en
tered the university when twenty-one
years old and his career as a preacher,
evangelist and missionary was an event
ful one. His fields of Christian endeavor
and labors included countries in all con
tinents of the world. His first pastoral
charge .was in the mountains of his native
State, where as a member of the Balti
more Conference he . preached for seven
years.
In 1849 he came to San Francisco and
for seven years labored among the rugged
and restless miners, adventurers and sail
ors who then comprised the greater part
of the population. He built the first
Methodist Episcopal church in San Fran
cisco and the site of the present City Hall
once stood in the name of William Taylor,
In trust for the church Â» he represented.
Many pioneers will recall the memorable
gospel meetings conducted by the Rev.
William Taylor in Portsmouth Square.
In 1852 the young minister and his fam
ily located in Alameda.
For seven years after leaving California
in 1856 he traveled over the United States
and Canada as an evangelist. The next'
fourteen years were spent In missionary
work in Australia, Cape Colony, . South
Africa, Hindostan, the West Indies and in
South America.
.He came back to this country as a del
egate to the general conference held In
Philadelphia in 1884. He went forth from
that conference with his title of Bishop
and with the continent of Africa as his
diocese.
MADE MANY CONVERTS.
In Natal, Kaffraria, Johannesburg, Pre
toria, St. Paul de Loando, Liberia and. all
along the eastern and western coasts of
South Africa Bishop Taylor made thou
sands of converts to Christianity. The
Bishop, with a corps of faithful assistants,
would fearlessly invade the territory oc
cupied by the fiercest tribes in South
Africa for the purpose of spreading the
gospel of Christ. The results of his pro
digious efforts were phenomenal and gave
a powerful impulse to the cause of Meth
odism among the natives and Europeans
in South Africa. Wherever Bishop Taylor
preached he was greeted by great crowds.
Even In the more civilized centers and at
the mission stations the church accom
modations were too limited for the con
gregations. Where the people could not
understand him In English Bishop Taylor
PALO ALTO, May 13.â Bishop Wil
liam Taylor of the- Methodist
Episcopal church died at the
home of his son, the Rev.
Ross Taylor, in Palo Alto this
afternoon. His death Is the. culmination
of a lingering Illness, with paralysis a3
the Immediate cause^
Bishop Taylor had just passed his 81st
birthday and sixtieth year of service in
the Methodist church. He was placed
on the retired list in 1894, and since 1858
has resided nearly all of the time in Palo
Alto.
ST. LOUIS, May IS.â J. A. Mlddleton,
general- freight agent of the St Louis and
San Francisco' Railroad Company, testi
fied before the Interstate Commerce Com
mission In St. Louis \ that his road had
given rebates on grain shipments In viola
tion of the interstate commerce law, and
iâ¢s expected that the commission will at
once ask for an injunction to restrain that
railroad company from further violation.
The hearing was conducted by Special
Agent Marchard and before Special Com
missioners* Prouty and Flfer.
Mlddleton' s testimony was to the effect
that 'the Frisco, prlqr to January 1, 1902,
had made .refunds to the Brlnson-Judd
Grain Company and Langdenbilrg â¢ & Co.
on grain brought to the Mississippi River.
He stated that the Frisco had been^ forced
to this practice by the competition of oth
er lines, which since have been enjoined.
The Frisco, according to the statement
of a freight official,, will make no objec
tion to an injunction; in fact, it is stated
that the company would rajher prefer to
have it. An Injunction against the Frisco
will j put all the roads in the grain terri
tory on the same basis.

MERRY TO THE LAST.
California Methodism was always proud
of him, not only as the custodian of its
early traditions, but as the hero of Its
most thrilling experiences.
Everything about Bishop Taylor was of
the e'pic- strain."' His great- frame, "put
up," as he was used to say, to "keep In
al! climates"; his wonderful.. voice, his
headlong convictions, ; the #pathos and
grandeur In his preaching and. prayer and
his impetuous activity made him a nota

Bishop Taylor was "the author of sev

was subject to pain ,ln the back always
more acute if I cautht-cold or over-ex-

OAKLAND.
Hodson pitched masterly ball. The Po
nies piled up eight hits off his delivery,
but he managed to keep them so well
scattered that the locals would have been
blanked but for two timely double shots
in the last inning. Jimmy Whalen tossed
them out for Harris and was. found good
and plenty when hits meant runs.
Both McNichols' errors were of , the
costly order, as they meant a pair of
tallies for Oakland.. McHale made a
great catch of Devereaux's hard drive ln
the second, but misjudged. Lohman's high
fly in the sixth. This netted Pete a dou
ble. Bone scored the only Pony gallop
and hammered out three safe ones out of
four times at bat. The score:
Oakland played as perfect a game of
ball in the morning across the bay as Was
ever seen on a California diamond. Not a
Pony reached first base without making a
hit, as no errors nor bases -on balls fig
ured in Ewing's score. The Poines were
erratic at intervals and proved easy
marks. â¢ .
HODSON PUZZLES PONIES.
About twenty yachts flying- tha San
Francisco, Corinthian or California bur
gees cruised up to Mare Island on Satur
day afternoon and evening, anchoring
near the new house of the Vallejo Yacht
ing and Boating Club. ' \ -
The yachtsmen were hospitably received
by the Vallejo tars and spent some time
in the clubhouse listening to or taking
part in an informal Jinks. A larger num
ber of boats would have made the trip
had the directors of the San Francisco
Yacht ., Club not called the cruise off be
cause of the desire not to draw away any
of the racing crew of The Challenger.
The schooners Lurline and Chispa and the
yawl Phyllis were the San Francisco rep
resentatives. â¢ ' Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦
The following yachts flew the Corin
thian flag: The flagship Edna; the sloops
Speedwell, Nixie, Genesta, Presto, Nep
tune, Belle. Josle, Aeolus, Mischief, Mist,
Phoenicia and Fawn, and the yawls
Frolic and Arcturus. Commodore A. E.
Chapman's sloop Helen was under way
yesterday. Ex-Commodore W. J. Woods*
Dorothy lay at anchor off the clubhouse.
The California Yacht Club was represent
ed by the. flagship Thelma and J. T. Car
rier's fast sloop Jessie E. â¢ : .
On Saturday night a strong northwester
blew and . there was a heavy sea in the
bay between Angel Island and Red Rock.
The boats that arrived late on Saturday
night at the rendezvous had a. hard beat
up the Mare Island Strait against a
strong ebb Jlde. At night the sloop Phoe
nicia during the absence of all her crew
drifted away, but was recovered on Sun
day morning. - . .
Between 9 and 11 o'clock yesterday
morning the yachts started on their
homeward trip, encountering a strong
northwester and heavy sea in San Pablo
Bay. Almost all the yachts carried reefed
mainsails and jibs. The California sloops
Jessie E and ..Thelma reached their moor
ings in Oakland Creek, the former at 3-30
and the latter shortly after, having sailed
nearly seventy miles since leaving their
moorings on Saturday afternoon and hav
ing had a stiff breeze almost every mo

SAN FRANCISCO.
Both Glendon and Schmidt pitched first
class ball, with the exception of a little
wlldness at times. Schmidt made Oak
land s only error and helped the Ponies
keep the run column from being a dead
0T W i he locaIs> errors were not costly
with the exception of Delmas' bad throw
In the ninth, which allowed Gorton to
travel as far as third. Pete Lohman had
his usual troubles to tell McDonald in
Â« fv> Â« Â« Â£. e PÂ° liceman . and the "stone
wall Infield was there with that custom
ary neat double play.
James J. Jeffries was an Interested
spectator at both the morning and the aft
ernoon games. He occupied a box at Rec
reation Park and did a lot of noisy root
ing. Gorton carried off the batting hon
ors with a single and a double out of two
times with the club. The score. â¢
The Ponies opened the seventh like a
lot of world beaters, and it looked as
â¢though they would score about r steen
times. Delmas hit one past third, Glendon
popped a bunt out of Schmidt's reach and
McMchols was safe on Schmidt's error of
a nice little bunt. The bleachers began
to yell like a lot of Comanches on a man
hunt, and all the locals swelled up anU
said as if with one voice; "Watch us."
A mighty yell went up as McHale toed
the plate and tried to goo-goo Schmidt.
He lined a hot one down to Mohler, who
immediately threw to Francks, who
stopped McMchols at the half-way sta
tion and doubled up McHale at first Glen-
d Â°n scored In the mix-up, but that was
all, for Bone easily died by the pitcher to
first route.
Oakland went to It in the second round
and scored the first run. Dunleavy had
a good lamp and walked. He stole second
and the ever-reliable Lohman scored him
on a stiff single to left. A pass to Gor
ton, Schmidt's sacrifice and Mohler's out
to first netted Oakland's second run in the
seventh spasm. The ninth also brought
gladness to the heart of Ewing through a
two-bagger by Gorton, Delmas' misplay
and Schmidt's little pop fly bÂ»ck of the
initial station.
The usual immense Sunday crowd was
there to greet the players as they tripped
upon the diamond. The Â¦Ponies were
harnessed up a little different than usual.
Nordyke's wrist is still to the bad, so
"Mormon" McNichols danced in and
about first The useful Josh Reilly did
the second-base act, and Bone, who has
been released, but is ! sometimes handy,
essayed to chase a few in the right-field
patch. ,A .-
It was the best,setto of the six, that
fracas at Recreation Park. It could
hardly be placed in the exciting, class, but
nevertheless it was exciting and doubtful
in spots. It contained much of that
snappy element that makes the heart of
the ardent crank beat wildly and causes
him to forget a certain amount of his
troubles.
For the fifth time during the past series
the champion Oakland baseball team
emerged from the field of battle decisively
victorious over the pride of San Fran
cisco. Five . well-earned victories in one
week is a record for any ball team to be
justly proud of, and Cal Swing's whirl
winds have not only earned the lead ln
the percentage column, but the praise and
admiration of all the patrons of the na
tional .game.
On tno home grounds at Oakland the
Ponies easily fell victims to the wiles of
the champs by a score of 6 to 1. The aft
ernoon game at the Eighth-street lot was
a 3 to 1 pick-up for the leaders. They
simply outplayed the Harris Bunch at all
stages of the game and won much as they
pleased. ."Â¦ Â¦ - >

The detailed results of yesterday's run
ning, with Judge John Grace's official
scores, follow: ; . â¢
ln the deciding course of the open stake
Otto was beaten by Lear King. The for
mer had the speed, but lacked experience.
During the course Lear King stumbled anil
fairly spun about on his head. Otto wait
ed until he regained his feet when they
went in pursuit of the hare. Lear King
finally won by a score of 6 to 4.
Aeneid Kennels' May Morning won the
puppy stake handily, defeating Flora
Belle, the 1 to 2 choice. May Morning is
the second daughter of the imported dog
Fine /Fire to distinguish herself. Her
sister, Maid o' Terminus, won recently at'
Stcckton. They are the. first of the Fine
Fire youngsters to start. ' <
Palo Alto, ruled a 1 to 2 favorite
throughout. In his first trials of the day
he ran like a champion, showing speed
and all _the qualities of a great grey
hound. Toward the close of the stake he
did not run with the same determination.
In the second course Palo Alto showed
four lengths of speed in the run across
the field, but again a tie score resulted.
At the third attempt Palo Alto showed
the edge had been taken from his speed,
as Ii6mer Boy led in a long run-up. In
the subsequent work Homer Boy proved
clever and game, running up a winning
sccre of 11 to 6. The hare escaped.
Otto Jahl's clever greyhound Homer
Boy required three trials to defeat cham
pion Palo Alto yesterday in the special
stake at Union Coursing Park. In the
first attempt Palo Alto led by two
lengths. In the subsequent work Homer
Boy proved the cleverer, and tied the
score at 4 to 4.
There were two four-oared barge races.
In the junior, class the "Webbs" made

the Alameda Club "Spiders," the cham

Coast, and an intermediate crew was eas
ily taken by the "Spiders," who coaxed
their opponents along for the greater part
of the course and then deserted them at
the finish; time 4:46.
To-day's events were managed by the
following officials: Referee, Charles :H.

in the senior outrigged skiff race. In the
same class John L. Lewis pulled a victory
away from Fred W. Ayers. This was the
closest and prettiest contest of the day.
Ayers for several years has been the
champion oarsman of the Alameda Boat
ing Club and has captured numerous
medals, in various regattas in California
and Oregon.
Andrew C. Webb and Roy Pratt in the
junior class outrigger skiffs were the first
to get the starter's gun. Webb won in a
drifting finish, time (5:58. The next three
heats were in the same class. George
Lawless defeated Harry Dumont. tlms
6:41. Leroy Pollard won from Charles J.

100 yards from the turning stake. Sidney
Pollard showed Edward Edwards how to
get home first, time 6:17. Edwards caughc
a "crab" and was rescued by a life-saving
crew. *
ALAMEDA. May IS.â "With a brass band,
barge and skiff races and luncheon the
Alameda Boating Club>, opened its twelfth
season to-day. Despite ,the stiff north
wind that blew steadily from sunrise to
sunset there was a large- attendance of
spectators at the oarsmen's quarters on
the estuary. Five hundred invitations
had been sent out by the members of the
club, and excellent accommodations were
provided for those who responded. The
big barge Sdrosls was tied up just west
of the clubhouse wharf, at the north end
of Chestnut street and directly opposite
the starting and finishing line. On the
barge live hundred chairs were arranged
for the sightseers. During the progress
of the races the guests were served soft
liquid refreshments and a light collation
by their hosts of the oar and paddle.
"Wind and whitecaps handicapped the
scullers and made fast time impossible,
but did not detract from the snap and
steam that the rival rowers threw into
their sweeps. In two instances contest
ants caught "crabs" and went out of
their crafts Into the water. All the races
were over a half-mile course with a turn.

. Champion Jim Jeffries arrived in this
city on the "Owl" yesterday morning
from Los Angeles, accompanied by "Kid"
Eagan. They are registered at the Met
ropole, Oakland. Jeff's sole purpose of
visiting San Francisco is to try to settle
the pending difficulties between himse.lf
and Fitzsimmons and arrange for the
much-talked-of heavy-weight champion
ship contest.
Jeffries called on Fitzsimmons yester
day afternoon and talked a little busi
ness with the lanky Cornishman. Both
a.greed to meet at the Central Theater, on
\\ ednesday afternoon at 3 o'clock, in
stead of a week from, to-day, for the
purpose of opening bids for the coming
light. Several local clubs will bid for the
big event. It .is expected the Century
Ciub of Los Angeles will endeavor to se
cure the contest for the southern city.
Billy Delaney declared himself as bsing
disgusted with Fitzsimmons. He safu:
"Fitzsimmons is trying to run a big blucf,
and, in my opinion, does not want to
light at all. When he wired Jeff several
weeks ago he said Jen! could select every
thing, and now I want to make him stick
to his word.
"In his previous fights Fitzsimmons re
fused to allow his opponents to wear
bandages and we want him to live up to'
the same thing here. Jeffries also de
mands at least eight weeks in which to
train after the articles of agreement have
been signed. We would also like to have
a California referee. I think there should
be no trouble in selecting a competent
man in this city."
Delaney also said he objected to sev
eral minor clauses in the New York arti
cles and that these should be arranged
to suit the Californian before the match
is made.
It is probable a match will be agreed
upon while all parties concerned are in
this city. There is no reason whatever
why the two fighters cannot come to
terms for a fight either in this city or Los

D0WLHTG OUTPLAYS WADDELL.
Exciting- Game at Sacramento Is Won
by the Senators.
SACRAMENTO. May 18.â The Senators
â¢woke up to-day and smashed Waddell
all over the lot. It was a great surprise
to the big fellow, but he was not alto
gether to blame, as he was working In
â¢ the face of a strong gale of wind that
â¢was all in favor of the batsmen. He was
not accorded the best of support in his
outfield. Dowling. who officiated for the
locals, had superb control, and In this
respect eclipsed Waddel. Toman made a
one-handed running catch of Eagan's fly
that was a feature. Waddell caught a
hot liner from Sheehan's bat that un
jointed his thumb, but he completed a
double play, had his thumb pulled back
into place and pitched the game out.

Some weeks ago Ne'son agreed to pur
chase the bark Wanderer from H. J.
Knowles for $5000. He was without funds,
but this was a trifling matter if sufHcient
freight could be secured for the northern
ports. He figured that he could get
enough tons of freight to pay for the
ship, but his calculations failed. The ton
nage of the freight he figured on fell
short more than one-half, and as he had
collected the greater part of the freight
charges In advance, as well as the pas
page money of several passengers to
Point Barrow he found himself unable
to meet his obligations. Nelson sought
to borrow money and he managed to se

seems to have gotten into very deep wa

against him when presented in court is
likely io prevent him from making the
whaling cruise to the Arctic which he
had in contemplation.
While Nelson is languishing behind the
bars the Wanderer is moored at Howard
street wharf awaitln" her skipper. The
various firms with which Nelson did
business have their eyes on the bark and
she will not sail for the Arctic in search
of whales until their bills are paid. The
crow are wondering where their pay is
coming' from and several of them have
concluded to take no chances on that
score. The' result is that the men are
leaving. Meanwhile Knowles, the origi
nal owner of the bark, will enter upon
possession of his property, to hold the
same pending judicial action in Nelson's
case.

VISALIA, May 18.â The wind has been
blowing furiously in Tulare County all
day. Considerable damage was done to
orchards, heavily-loaded limbs being
blown off the fruit trees. At 5:15 o'clock
to-night a sandstorm of considerable se
verity swept over the plains. i>
MODESTO. May 18.â Grain and fruit
crops and shade trees in this county suf
fered greatly to-day from a gale, the
strongest felt here for yeafs. Fruit in
the green state wasblowii from trees,
grain was withered by the wind and
shade trees everywhere were blown down
and broken.
A cross current of wind to-night from
a generally southern direction, carrying
much sand and dust, makes the weather
extremely disagreeable. The local fore
cast official is of the opinion that there
is little prospect of rain, as, while the
barcmeter is low, the nigh temperature
has dried the moisture in the atmosphere.
LOS ANGELES, May 18.â A strong
wind, varying In direction and velocity,
has prevailed here all , day: This morn
ing it blew a moderate gale from tha
East, but later veered to the northwest

twenty- live miles an hour in Los Angeles
and much stronger in exposed places.
The wind is accompanied by a high tem
perature, the thermometer registering a
maximum of 74 degrees this afternoon.
As a result vegetation is suffering.

Kelly was a Native Son and a member
of Aerie No. 5 of Eagles in San Fran
cisco. He was employed as a bartender.
James Kelly when boarding a train at
Schuetzen Park yesterday afternoon was
run over and killed. Kelly, who lived in
San Francisco, had been attending the
fourth annual picnic of the Eagles at
the park and was getting on the train of
the California Northwestern Railroad
when the accident occurred. His wife,
who accompanied him to the picnic, had
preceded him in the cars.
Kelly waited until the train started and
then attempted to jump on. His foot
slipped and he went under. The wheels
ran over both legs, and before the alarm
could be given and the train stopped two
cars had passed over the body. When
taken from under the train Kelly was
dead. Mrs. Kelly was not aware that her
husband had been killed, and not until
reaching the terminus of the road at
Tiburon did she learn of the accident.

Mackenzie's ticket â Mayor, Adolph

man, (at large) H. D. Mathews, (First
"Ward) Patrick Murray, (Fourth Ward)
A. L. Hubbard.
Both sides to-night are confident of
electing their tickets. Hayes and other
leaders of the Citizens' Reform party
claim the election by about 1400 votes, if
not more. Mackenzie is not so confident
of an easy victory and places his possi
ble majority at 650.
The State at large i ; watching the out
- come of the election. While it is a mu-'
nicipal one, the Gage and anti-Gage
forces are well lined up in the Macken
zie and Citizens' parties, and the outcome
will be a good index of what support the
Governor may expect in Santa Clara
County should he again be a candidate.
Ja order to help Gage Mackenzie is dofng
his hardest work and politicians in San
Francisco and elsewhere are lending en
couragement and aid. The Mackenzie
faction has an endless supply of money,
which they are using in the fight, and it
is believed some of this is being furnished
by the State machine.
Never befcre have factions been so tire
less in a campaign. Every San Josean
wno has been away has been sent for to
come home and vote. There are about
4SÂ»J voters registered and nearly this
number of ballots will be cart. The Mac
kenzie faction in 1S9S defeated S. E.
Smith for Mayor by 400 and two years
ago Martin beat Edwards for Mayor by

SAN JOSE, May 18.â To-morrow's elec
tion will be the most interesting in the
history of San Jose. The campaign of
both sides closed Ust night with precinct
meetings, and the workers have put in
to-day trying to convince doubtful voters
what they should do There has been a
tig influx of strangers in the last two
days', and the Citizens' Committee are
openly charging that th-s Mackenzie
forces have imported voters. Four ar
rests have already been made for illegal
registration.

The message further stated, that the
Boer war would probably altogether cease

The remount station at Lathrop, thirty

parts of the British Empire.
PRETORIA May 18.â The Boer dele
gates who are assembled at Vereening,
Transvaal, held prolonged conferences
Thursday and Friday of last week.
LONDON, May 19.â A dispatch to the*
Times from Pretoria says that about 163
Beer leaders are assembled at Vereen
ing, and that their demeanor leads one
to suppose they will vote in favor of a
continuatioa of hostilities, but the fact
that the voting is by ballot may turn
the balance to the side of peace. What
ever the direct result of the conference
may be, says the correspondent, the end
of the war Is not distant, because the con
ference will probably be followed by num
erous surrenders in various directions,
enabling large bodies of British troops to
be liberated and poured into the resisting
districts.

The bill at the Central' for the week be
ginning to-night will be Harvey's cele
brated emotional drama, "Woman
Against Woman," and more than the or
dinary interest attaches to the production
as it serves to introduce the Central's new
leading lady, Miss Fanny Mclntyre, who
appears for the first time here. She will
assume the principal role, and the rest of
John Drew and "The Second in Com
mand'\is on for another week at the Co
lumbia Theater, and it is needless to add
that that ever-welcome actor and Mar
shall's new comedy will serve to keep the
house crowded during the week. The play
is handsomely staged and the costumes
are very beautiful.
. "The Singing Girl," with its humorous
situations and splendid list of musical hits,
still continues to draw big houses to the
Tivoli. The show commences its third
week to-night, and there is not the least
sign of a decrease in its popularity. "The
Singing Girl" appears to have been pro
duced by the author specially for the
stock company of the Tlvoll, as it affords
each member an opportunity to display
his or her particular talent. In the title
role Annie Myers can bring the charm of
her sweet voice into play to the limit,
while in the character of Prince Pumper
nickel Ferris Hartman appears at hl3
best. All the rest of the cast is equally
as well suited.
"Waddy Googan," the comedy by Ed
ward Harrigan, will be presented this
week at the Grand Opera-house. The play
is said to be full of laughs. The fact that
this week is Harrigan' s farewell appear
ance here should serve to draw large,
crowds to the Grand Opera-house, as the
actor-author J has many friends in this
city.
"Fiddle Dee Dee" begins its seventh
week at Fischer's Theater to-night, and
it is reported that the advance sale of
seats is the largest yet. There is an un
broken line at the box-office from the end
of one week to the other, and the run
promises to eclipse any other in the his
tory of this city. Freda Gallick, a new
addition to the stock company, will sing
to-night "MollieJShannon," the song with
which Anna Held made* such a hit in the
"Little Duchess" at the Casino in New
York last season. There will be a special
matinee on Decoration day.
"The Brixton Burglary" will be put on
at the Alcazar this evening. Handled by
this theater's unusually capable stock
company, this production should do a big
business. This will be its first presenta
tion in this city. It has made a great hit
in London and New York, and with the
approval of these two great cities upon it
comes to capture San Francisco.
The Neill Company presented one of its
greatest successes, "The Lottery of
Love," for the* first time this season at
the California Theater last night. It has
come to be taken as a matter of course
in San Francisco that what, the Neills
present is good, and this clever little
comedy occupies a prominent place in the
company's repertoire. Nein as Double
dot, the man whose affections wax and
wane, as the mother-in-law is distant or
painfully close at hand, could make the
most blase theater-goer hold his sides
In laughter. Lillian Andrews, in the
character of Zenobia Sherramy, is second
only to Neill as a funmaker. Her sailor's
hornpipe took the house by storm. Edythe
Chapman occupies in this play a less im
portant role than usual, but is able, nev
ertheless, to display her talents quite
brilliantly as the obedient daughter of
the disagreeable mother-in-law. Marian
Stone, as Doubledot's second wife, is in
deed charming. John .W. Burton, Frank
McVicars and Donald Bowles also appear
to advantage. The rest of the cast is ex
cellent, and contributes generously to the
success of "The Lottery of Love."
Lotta Gladstone is an artist with a
laugh that is infectious. As a monologist
she is certainly the peer of any member
of her sex. Her caricatures are remark
able, and she was accorded the apprecia
tion she deserves. Mr. and Mrs. Alfred
Kelcy presented a charming little farce
entitled "Uncle Phineas." It is a gem,
and gives both a chance to display versa
tility. Little Elsie gave some clever imi
tations, but her rendition of Digby Bell's
dt&cription of a lad's view of the base-
Lall game made the "fans". howl with
delight. Kelly and Dent opened the bill
with "Ginger ' Snaps," and made good.
Lew Sully'tells many new stories and sings
songs that prove that Mayor Schmitz is
more popular than Governor Gage. The
eight Picchlani "sisters" had the audience
guessing. There seems to be a few men in
the bunch, but their disguise was like
their actâ perfection. Sager Midgley and
Gertie Carlisle, old favorites, scored
heavily in a new sketch. She is the same
Gertie Carlisle that won hearts when a
schoolgirl. Dooley and Fowler are black
face comedians of high order. ThÂ£y' dance
and sing wonderfully well. Mile. Ches
ter's $10,000 statue dog closes a splendid
bill.
Every act on the Orpheum's bill is' a
star attraction this week. There was
not half a minute's lagging of interest
on the part of the audience last night.
The new numbers are splendid, and ! the
hold-overs can be seen a dozen times
without becoming tedious.
the cast will be fully up to the standard.
Bacon and Vane, Byrne and West,
Maude and Gladys Sorensen, Jack Sym
onds, Fetching, brothers, Grant and Grant
and new moving pictures are prominent
on this week's bill at the Chutes. A vau
deville performance is given every after
noon and evening.
When Dr. Gladding was questioned to
day he refused to disclose the exact con
text of the dead woman's last statement,
but he said:
When Mrs. Marsellis' dying statement to me
In that testimony Dr. Payne was fully
and particularly corroborated by Dr.
Bowell.
At the inquest last night Dr. Payne's
testimony was that Mrs. Marsellis' in
juries were the result of violence, and
that the external bruises were ante
mcrtem.
Let Dr. Gladding make his statements under
oath. So far as I am concerned I am thor
oughly satisfied with my report upon the au
topsy. The bruises were not post-mortem
changes. They were there before Â¦ Mrs. Mar
sellis died. There can be no doubt about it.
I shall stand by my testimony in every par
ticular.' . â¢ , . ; .
Dr. l^rank H. Payne, one of Berkeley's
prominent surgeons, who was assisted
during the autopsy by Dr. Hubert N.-
Rowell, formerly Health Officer and 5 a
leading physician of the college town, de
clared to-night that he was entirely un
concerned over any of Dr. Gladding's
statements. Dr. Payne said:
If Dr. Gladding can throw any light on this
case he will be given ample opportunity to do
so to-morrow evening, when the inquest" will
be resumed. Dr. Gladding has refused to obey
one summons to attend and another one has
gone out to him. He will, in my opinion, be
present to-morrow evening. I do not care to
discuss any personal matters connected with
Dr. Gladding and myself.
So far as the bruises and that sort of thing
are concerned we have in evidence the testi
mony of the two autopsy surgeons that they
were inflicted before death. It is not ray busi
ness to criticize the testimony, bo it makes no
difference to me personally or as Coroner what
Dr. Gladding or any other witness might say.
PAYNE IS NOT PERTURBED.
But Coroner Mehrmann says he is not
at all alarmed concerning Dr. Gladding s
statements. The Coroner says:
And Dr. Gladding, who refused to obey
Coroner Mehrmann's subpena, also an
nounces that from the deathbed state
ments of Mrs. Marsellis he does not be
lieve murder was done, although he be
lieves the case is one which will require
considerable official investigation.
But Dr. Gladding's attack has assumed
a personal phase as well. He accuses the
Coroner of spitefully using him, and he
is sure that he will never testify before
that official, unless compelled to do so
by process of law. That means Dr. Glad
ding purposes to compel Coroner Mehr
mann to bring film into court. The law
provides a very ; simple means, Â¦' for it
clothes the Coroner with power to en
force the arrest and the detention in
pri&on of the delinquent witness until he
shall purge himself of contempt by obe
dience to the summons.
The explosive hurled by the West Berke
ley medico is in the shape of a declara
tion that when Mrs. Marsellis died there
were no bruises on her body. This sim
ply means that if Dr. Gladding's , state
ment is correct the marks upon the body
of which the autopsy surgeons have'
made much in their testimony are only
the usual post-mortem changes and : dis
coiorations of the flesh. . .

crated yesterday morning with
elaborate ceremony by . the Â¦'Â¦'Right
Rev. .the Bishop of ' Calif ornia v assisted
by many prominent -Episcopal' clergymen.
The church edifice was finished two
years ago, but owing to a debt of $7000
remaining upon it the consecration : sev :
vices were delayed. The rector, â¢ Rev..
Burr M. Weeden, recently succeeded ; in
raising the debt, and arrangements . were,
completed for the consecration of the
building. Â¦ . .- â¢: . Â»
The services yesterday consisted of the
holy communion in the early morning and
the consecration at 11 a. m. The interior
of the church had been handsomely ..dec r
orated with spring flowers, a'\ series of
floral arches extending across the chancel.;
. The. service^pf the everiing.was.no less
interesting than that of the morning. The
singing lot the augmented choir was, in
every sense exquisite. "Magnificat. Nunc
Dimmittis,". in A, by.j,West, ,was, indeed/
a beautiful andrfaultless rendition; as was
also the singing or Stainer's sweetly sim
ple hymn, "Gracious Spirit, Â¦ Holy Ghost,'.'
"A. sermon by the Right Reverend Bishop
Moreland was particularly "appropriate, to
the day's exercises. ' "Reverence My Sanc
tuary, I Am the'Ijbrd," was the theme. Â¦
The Bishop lucidly explained theofflcea
for. which, the ; newly . consecrated ; church
"might be used. Â¦"Therein is- the presence
of. God," he'said. "but ds-not. God's pres
ence 'at our hearth, - on' the boundless

At the park the coldness of the weather
detracted greatly from the crowds gener
ally seen around the music stand. Mr.
Steindorff as usual had an excellent pro
gramme arranged. It is quite apparent
that the public is well pleased with the
new leader's selections, as well as with
the manner in which he presents them.
There were few people at the beach
yesterday. The stiff northwest wind which
was blowing stirred up a miniature sand
storm. It was almost an impossibility for
one to walk along the road in front of the
Cliff House without being carried in an
other direction by the gale. The breakers
were exceedingly large.

price. Don't worry; if price and quality

The board discussed the trouble which
has arisen between the Labor Council and
the Building Trades Council over the re
fusal of the latter organization to allow
Carpenters' Union No. 4S3 to affiliate with
the Labor Council. In regard to the con
troversy the board adopted a resolution
in which it denounced the carpenters who
have refused to accept the mandate of
the Building Trades Council as destroyers
of unionism.

If I can keep up with the pace of San Fran-

for a lot of people in my line of business. . ;
? Frisco is growing pretty fast now and' I'm .
coming along right in the swim of prosperity. My
business is four times over that of last year â I've
doubled the size of my store and doubled my num-
ber of friends.
There's good reason- for this Gibson growth. /
Ask any customer why they like to buy of me. Ask
them why they come back again. Ask them why
they send their friends to me.
j Their answer will give you the secret of my success.
