Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET. N.|
W., WASHINGTON. Juno 5.â When Sec
retary Root returned to his desk this
morning the entire War Department was
humming and buzzing with comment on
the latest breach of axmy regulations and
tfco entire staff of General Miles denying
tfcat their chief had participated In the
disclosure of army secrets. It is bluntly
stated by officials of the War Department
that General Miles is suspected of having
been instrumental in getting- these charges
before the public. No secret has been
made of the suspicions against General
Miles in the past. The War Department
takes the view that the officer or em
ploye who abstracted these reports so that
they should bÂ« made public was guilty
not only of violating army regulations but
was, also guilty of attacking the United
States army of which he was a part.
Hence, if General Miles had a hand in
this they say he has been attacking
the army of which ha Is the highest of
ficer.
PROOF IS LACKING.
Thus far no proof has been brought
against General Miles. It Is all based on
Inference, the inference being that Gen
eral Miles Is at loggerheads with Presi
dent Roosevelt, Secretary of War Root,
Adjutant General Corbin, General Chaf-
Jee, whom he sought to supplant in China
and the Philippines, and, in fact, with the
entire military organization.
It la pointed out that GÂ«neral Miles has
sLir*xAy Â«tt^/-k,>d the President and Sec
retary of War and their legislation In a
"privileged communication" before the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs.
Practically all persons through whose
hands the damaging charges made by
Private We4r passed have denied that
they had a hand in maJcing them public.
It was also emphatically denied by Gen
eral Miles' aids to-day that anybody at
army headquarters was in collusion with
Senator Culberscn. General Miles may
r.ot return to Washington until after the
celebration at West Point on June 11. but
he will be called upon for information.
Senator Culberson, who got the Weir
charges into the Congressional Record,
complicated the situation to-day by mak
ing the following statement:
"In view of what occurred I do not
feel that I am called upon to disclose
where I obtained the information I pre
sented to tho Senate during the Philip
pine debate last Tuesday. I will say this
much, however, that I obtained the in
formation from a reputable gentleman,
â¢who Is neither directly nor Indirectly
connected with the army or the War De
partment."
RELIES ON CULBERSON.
KANSAS CITY, June 5.â Lieutenant
General Nelson A. Miles, commanding
the army, passed through Kansas City
last night, it is said, on his way from
Fort Riley to Washington, called there
by President Roosevelt and threatened
â¢with an immediate court-martial on a
charge of having betrayed certain official
secrets. General Miles went through here
the day before attended by several other
members of a board convened to observe
long gauge gun tests at Fort Riley, to
be bo engaged for several days; and he
came back yesterday afternoon entirely
alone and in such haste that he had not
even reserved a sleeping-car berth.
A reporter read to General Miles a spe
cial dispatch eaying that he was suspected
In the White Hous.e of having furnished
details of the scandal Involving Lieutenant
Arnold to Senator Culberson. General
Miles' comment was: "Senator Culberson
teems to have made an answer as full
as one could make and as explicit as Sen
ator Bcveridge or any one could demand."
"But for yourself, general?"
"I repeat that Senator Culberson seems
to have made the reply for which you are
asking."
"There Is a second dispatch, general,"
was then remarked, "to the effect that
you are peremptorily ordered back to
Washington to face charges."
General Miles would make no reply to
this. He left for Washington at 6:30 last
right, a short time after his arrival from
Fort Rflcy. While here he did not leave
the Union slntion.

Young when questioned admitted that he
inserted the glowing advertisement about
the Diamond Oil Company which, how
ever, had been exposed in a local oil
Journal as being far from what it claimed
to be.
When Balliet was asked to explain his
connection with, the companies of which
he was president, he stated that he had
bc*n elected presiflent during his absence
and without his knowledge or consent
Though he. at tha> time, denied knowing
any one of the name of "A. D. Young"
in connection with his . offices, it wa s'
known that the party was Miss Alice D
Young, a' stenographer ;in his sulte r of
offices, who attended to tho receipt of all
the mail. He, however, on being pressed
on the subject, produced a man named
Cal Young, an advertising solicitor for an
Eastern newspaper.
The San Francisco Mining Company, of
which Balliet was shown to bo president
was incorporated for the purpose of work
ing the Josephine mine in El Dorado
County. The mine had been owned by J.
M. Nougues, an attorney of this city who
sought the. aid of Balliet to exploit it on
the market.
At the time one issue of a Boston news
paper contained no less than six columns
of advertising and reading matter of com
panies operated from Balliet's rooms. The
Pacific Oil Company was written up aa
being one of the great oil companies of
California, situated in the Arroyo Honda
district of the San Joaquin Valley. The
Diamond Oil Company was written up as
one of the finest oil properties in the Me-
Kittrick district and Investors were asked
to address "A. D. Young. Room 8, 508
California street, San Francisco."
I-etson Balliet came into particular
prominence in San Francisco when in
June. 3901. the postal authorities stopped
the heavy mail addressed to him He
held forth as a. mining king, owner of
streetcar lines, electric light works and
newspapers In a suite of offices at 508
California street. He occupied no* less
than twelve rooms and was evidently do
ing a vast business. Ten typewriters
were engaged answering people all over
the country, who were sending money to
Balliet for Investment after reading ac
counts of his swift rise to fortune and the
many enterprises with which he was con
nected.

The Government objected to the use of
the mails to procure money in the first
place for the sale of stock In a company
which had no valid title to the property
in which its stockholders were assured
they would participateTsecondly, to the
sale of stock through the mails without
expending the money he received in de
veloping the property he was selling ac
cording to his agreement. . ....
UNCLE SAM OBJECTS.
When he had secured possession of the
mine he removed his headquarters to
San Francisco and operated from that
city, where he employed thirty people
night and day sending out circulars and
letters advertising his proposition.
Balliet Is 29 years o.f age and the son
of Judge B. F. Balliet, recently of the
Polk County District bench, residing in
this city. Young Balliet was engaged in
no business unfil he acquired the man
agement of the White Swan Mining and
Milling Company. A large number of
technical difficulties concerning the title
to the property having' arisen, he bought
the claims and secured a clear title to
the White Swan mine. Meanwhile he
had been selling stock in the property.
It was essential for the government to
prove that Balliet intended to defraud
the investors when he started to use
the mails to sell them stock. This was
shown by his expenditure of about $75,000
of the money in the manner described
and in no way connected with the devel
opment of the property. The Govern
ment clinched the case against Balliet
when he went on the stand and failed to
testify as t3 the whereabouts of the re

lected by the sale of the stock, but not
accounted for.

that Balliet operated the scheme he had

Lieutenant Ernest Hagedorn, of. the
Twenty-Eighth Infantry, to be dismissed

Taft reviewed in a summary way the
questions in'the Philippines which require

United States to the Catholic church, but
declared that such a readjustment was
merely a necessity under the American
constitution. Governor Taft referred to
the prosperity and the freedom of the

to-day by Representative Bartholdt. The

miral for his action in refusing tq'join in

after the legation relief expedition ar

"We have not seen the end of our
troubles in China," said a high official to
day. " "No one can foretell what will hap
pen and nothing will surprise those who
are familiar with the march of recent
events in the Orient."
Special Commissioner Rockhill, repre
senting the United States, took the ground
when the indemnity was being discussed
originally that 450,000,000 taels was" exces
sive ' and probably beyond the ability of
China to pay. The addition of $70,000,000
to this and the effort of Chinese officials
to wring money from the people have un
doubtedly added to the national unrest.
EXCESSIVE INDEMNITY.
It is known that the people of China
are already groaning beneath the taxa
tion which many will probably be unable
to pay. The depreciation in the price of
silver and the insistence of the European
powers that China meet her obligations
in gold will cause an Increase of the in
demnity to be paid by China of nearly
570,000,000. (
Whether these uprisings are really be
ing encouraged by the 'French occupants
of Tonkin and the Germans In Shantung
in order to give an excuse for foreign
intervention in the affairs of China or
whether they have their inception in the
great rational feeling of unrest which
flamed so fiercely two years ago the offi
cials here do not pretend to say. They
would not be surprised to see these
troubles grow until they again become the
subject of international consultations.
OFFICIALS CANNOT SAY.
It Is recalled that the Boxer uprising
which occurred In 1900, resulting In the
Imprisonment of the foreign legations, be
gan with rumors which .-no ' one under
stood, similar to those which are now
coming from China. Even Minister Con
ger did not understand them and the full
significance did not dawn until the storm

LEADS TO SMALL RIOTS
Soon after the agreement, which is a
compromise, was ratified by the men a
report coming from some untraceable
source spread that the packers had deter
mined to take back only teamsters who
had not been actively concerned In the
strike. That the companies would exer
cise a choice in taking their former
teamsters back seemed not to have oc
curred to the men before, and on investi
gation it was found that several workmen
employed in the yards had recently been
discharged. These men declare that they
have been singled out because they were
strong union men and strike sympathiz
ers. This is denied by the packers, but
the statements of the discharged men are
being carefully investigated.'
The men who have been discharged are
members of the Stock Yards Employes'
Union. Their organization, which was
formed less than three weeks ago, and al
ready has a membership of over 700 was
affiliated with the butchers' union Mich
ael Donnelly, president of the North
American Meat Cutters' Union, has been
asked to adjust the trouble. Late to
night a conference between Donnelly and
A. W. Leonard, superintendent of the
Union Stock Yards Transit Company
was arranged. Leonard will be asked to
reinstate the men who have been dis
charged and unless he consents to do so
it is said that the 5000 butchers employed
ir. the different packing plants will be
called out on strike.
4. Any teamster receiving more than the
scale of wages stated shall , not Buffer a re
duction of wages after this agreement goes into
effect.
Instead of another day of rioting and
broken heads there was peace and laugh
ter as the two sides to the controversy
good naturedly discussed the ending of
the trouble. When the members of the
conference separated this morning the
strike was virtually at an end, but the
agreement of the committeemen had to be
ratified by the packers and teamsters.
Thi3 caused some further delay and it was
not until this evening that all arrange
ments had been completed for the strik
ers to return to work to-morrow. Mean
while the only teams called for were to
deliver meat urgently needed. The others
were told to make the remainder of tho
day a holiday and to report for duty to
morrow.
The^ terms of agreement are as follows:
1. That there shall be no discrimination
against union teamsters.
2. The scale of wages for teamsters shall
be fair.
3. No teamsters ehall be compelled to work
on Labor day.
CHICAGO, June 5.â Quiet reigned to-day
in the turbulent Stock Yards district as
a result of the teamsters' strike, but the
happiness of the men was marred some
what by a report that the packers will re
fuse to employ leaders among the striking
teamsters. The report caused much un
easiness among the men.. The teamsters
are to return to work to-morrow morning.
A few were driving teams to-day but the
majority we're told to report to-morrow.

CHICAGO ENJOYS
A DAY OF PEACE
to-day. Crowds of men blocked tha
streets and hooted and jeered at the of-^
fleers and passengers ' of cars, hurllns
missiles through windows, cutting trolley
ropes and defacing the inner fittings of
cars. The officers freely used their clubs
in half a dozen individual riots, mounted
men charged tlje crowds and twenty-five
arrests were mA.de.
The initial cause of the disturbance waa
the parade of about 300 striking con
ductors and motormen. The line of march
led up the main thoroughfare, where a
crowd soon gathered. Motormen and con
ductors on the cars which followed were
hissed and jeered at until a blockade gava
opportunity for a demonstration.
There was instant response. The trolley
was pulled off, missiles filled the air and
for half an hour thousands shouted them
selves hoarse. The police were unable to
gain the mastery until a number of ar
rests were made, which started the crowd
in another direction. Similar outbreaks
followed and they grew so serious that all
the available police in the city were called
into the business section. Towards mid
night the excitement ceased and the
crowds, 'dispersed, the absence of cars
eliminating the chief cause of irritation.
WASHINGTON, June 5.â Truman O.
Palmer of Chicago was a witness to-day
before the Senate Committee on Cuban
Relations. For the past four years
Palmer has been engaged in the promo
tion of beet sugar Interests. He gave a
list of seventeen American corporations
which, he said, have 688,777 acres In sugar
producing lands in Cuba, with an annual
capacity of 255,425 tons. Of these seven
teen companies ten have on file war
claims against the Government of thd
United States aggregating J9.665.974. The)
largest of these claims, for $4,177,698, Jwas
filed by the Constancio Sugar Company,
with an estate of 57,000 acres and an an
nal capacity of 21,000 tons. Palmer said ha
had secured the facts upon which this,
statement is based from the official rec
ords of the Spanish Claims Commission
and from statements made by witnesses
before the Senate Committee and tha
House Committee on Ways and means.
The witness said that an effort on hl3
part to place the bonds of a beet sugar
company had failed last December be
cause of the agitation to secure a reduc
tion of the duty on Cuban sugar and that
he later had sold his interest in this com
pany and since then had been devoting his
attention to the question of the proposed
tariff reduction.
Palmer also presented a list of estates
owned by individuals who are citizens of
the United States and who reside in tha
United States, but most of whom ara
either of Cuban or American birth. Thl3
list included "forty-one estates of 366.88S
acres, with an average sugar production
of 294,495 tons. Of these forty-one estate*
thirty-five filed war claims against tho
Government of the United States aggre
gating 113,646.544.
Palmer deduced from tho flgnrea given
in this connection that only 30 per cent of
the product was supplied by tho farmers
who do not own their own factories.
When Senator Platt asked what had In
duced witness to manifest so great an ln-<
terest in the legislation proposed he re*
plied:
"Because that I believe If this tariff re
duction legislation falls I shall have na
difficulty in securing the means of build
ing at least one beet sugar factory m

STOCKTON, June 5.â Ex-Governor Budd
came here this morning to talk to the
employes of the street railroad company,
who have been restless of late because
they wanted higher pay and did not know
who owned the road. Budd recently sold
four-fifths of the stock ! of the company
owning the road to H. E. Huntington and
for the present is representing that gen
tleman in the management of the road
He told the men to-day that Huntington
is in New York on Important business and
nothing will' be done in the way of im
provements until he returns trom the
East, but Budd announced that the re
quest of the men for an increase in pay
would be granted at once. He therefore
ordered that their pay be increased from
18 cents to 20 cents per hour, making the
regular pay for ten hours work 32.
The day men accepted the offer, but
some of the nisrht men wanted more,
though they agreed to be content until
the road has been placed on a better foot

tensions and will ultimately run the road
to Lodi, fourteen miles, and possibly to

Knight Templar Receives Honor.
Earl Spencer, the Liberal leader in the
House of Lords, added his tribute to the
British forces in South Africa, and Lord
Salisbury's motion' for a vote of thanks
to the officers and men of the imperial
The Premier also said he thought the
House had never before thanked nor had
such good cause to thank the colonial
troops for their assistance. Not long ago
many people in Europe thought that the
time of the downfall of the British em
pire had arrived. But the colonial troops
came brilliantly to Great Britain's as
sistance, and the more Great Britain's
difficulties increased the more colonial
loyalty had manifested itself in aiding
the empire to defy the hostility and bit
terness of all its opponents. Great Brit
ain had the assistance of a force which,
a few years ago, was not dreamed of
and that was the subject of exultation In
England. It was shown . that when the
country was denuded of troops her naval
supremacy was sufficient to protect her
and Great Britain was never safer than
during the period of war. V- '--; ;
The Prince of Wales and many peer
esses were present in the House of
Lords when Lord Salisbury moved a vote
of thanks to the officers and men of the
imperial forces in South Africa. Th^mo
ticn specially mentioned the colonial Pre
miers, and paid a tribute to the splendid
qualities of the troops, who, he said,
contended under no ordinary difficulties
against an enemy which had accumulat
ed vast stores of munitions of war and
who had the advantage of fighting in a
peculiar country with which they were
thoroughly familiar.
THANKS OF THE LORDS.
Balfour's motion, which included an
expression of condolence with the be
reaved, was adopted by 382 to 22 votes.
Balfour was then allowed to proceed.
He said there was no exact parallel for
the motion. Never before had Great Brit
ain sent so vast an army beyond the seas
never before had she fought such a grea*
campaign without allies and she never
had been so aided by her volunteers and
colonial troops, whose valor and human
ity he praised.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman sec
onded the motion.
When Balfour rose to move a vote of
thanks to the officers and men of the
army of South Africa the uproar was re
newed by the Irish-Nationalists, as a pro
test against the treatment of Redmond.
The speaker of the House of Commons,
William Court Gully, thereupon appeared
and asked thejn to desist, in the interest
of freedom of debate, to which John Red
mond retorted that it was exactly in the
interest of such freedom that the Irish
Nationalists protested.
"You allow the women and children of
soldiers to starve in order to honor the
favorites of your corrupt society."
This statement was greeted with shouts
of "sit down," "name him," and "divide,"
while the Irish members jeeringly advised
the Ministerialists to call in the police.
Amid the din Redmond was heard to
say that the House was disgracing itself
in complimenting the commander of the
British forces in South Africa, while al
lowing the men who had fought there to
drift into the workhouse, and that the
House was making itself ridiculous in
the eyes of the world by a motion pre
tending to celebrate some great feat of
arms. After a quarter of an hour spent
by Redmond in endeavoring to get a
hearing, the closure was moved and
adopted, and the grant to Lord Kitchen
er was carried by 380 to 44 votes. The
minority consisted of the Irish National
ists and two or three Radicals.
During his speech Redmond indulged
in much violence of language and had to
be refreshed by a drink brought in by a
friend. He said, that as an additional rea
son why he objected to the vote was be
cause Lord Kitchener had violated the
tomb of the Mahdi at Khartoum, and he
asserted that Lord Kitchener and Lord
Roberts, during the South African war,
had been guilty of more disgraceful con
duct than any of the other generals.
Then, turning to the ministerial
benches, Redmond shouted:
ALSO "SCORES ROBERTS.
The chairman replied to Redmond's ap
peal for a fair hearing, that it was im
possible to control the House, to which
his speech appeared distasteful.
Redmond said he desired to repeat that
Lord Kitchener was responsible for thje
death of 15,000 children and that he hatd
warred on women and children. That was
his absolute conviction and he refused to
withdraw the words. The country was
living in an atmosphere of hypocrisy.
When a man spoke the truth he was
gagged.
Redmond's remarks were almost un
hearable, owing to the uproar caused by
the cheers of the Irish Nationalists and
the protests of the members of other par
ties.
William Redmond, Irish Nationalist, J
caused a scene of great disorder by re
marking that Lord Kitchener would go
down to history as a general who had
"made war on women and children." This
remark called for loud cries of "with
draw" and appeals to the chairman to i
call Redmond to order. The chairman :
said the expression used was not disor
derly, but a majority of the House re- i
fused to listen any further to Redmond '
and interrupted him with all kinds of
shouts.
LEADS OPPOSITION. j
John Dillon, Irish Nationalist, led the op- Â¦
position in behalf of the Nationalists. â¢
JJillon said he and his friends absolutely
objected to the vote because they were ;
opposed to the policy of the war in South i
Alrica and the conduct of the campaign,
which involved wholesale devastation ot
the country, the burning of farms and
sacrifice of life. . j
Henry Labouchere, Advanced Liberal, ;
also opposed the vote. :
'J.he .Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell
liiinnerman, wno seconded tne motion,
paid a warm tribute to lÂ»rd .Kitchener as

LONDON, June 5.â In accordance with
King Edward's message to the House of
Commons yesterday, the Government
leader, A. J. Balfour, in the House this
afternoon asked for a vote of Â£50,000 to
lA)rd Kitchener. As a' remarkable coin
cidence, Parliament, June 5, three years
ago, voted its thanks and Â£30,000 to the
tame general for his services- in Egypt.
HAZELTON, Pa.; June .5.â About 100
Slavonian immigrants fresh from Europe
were brought to-night in a special car at
tached to a Lehigh Valley train. They
were sent to the A. S. Van Winkle colliery
at Coleran, where, it Is said, they will
Jie put to work to-morrow. This is the
first importation of foreigners to the an
thracite coal regions to fill the places of
strikers. The officials of the Van Winkle
office will neither confirm nor deny that
the new arrivals were to be employed by
their company. Â¦ ;
SCRANTON, Pa., June 5.â The first ser
ious outbreak . of disorder in connection
with the miners' strike in the Lackawan
na region occurred ; to-night at Forest
City. David Owens, a pump runner at
the Clifford Colliery of the Hillside Com
pany, was attacked by a mob of 300 strik
ers while on.his way to work and beaten
into insensibility. He was revived and his
wounds dressed and then taken to his
home. His 'injuries, while severe, are not
serious.-. â¢ â¢;Â¦â¢.- - ... ..: . â¢ . .,)â¢;..Â¦
The mine superintendents had nothing
to. add to the day's budget of news. All
of them said they were getting along
fairly well. .They continue to have trouble
in operating their pumps, however, and
in some mines the water . is creeping up
slowly,- notwithstanding the strenuous ef
forts of the men on hand to keep it down.
This is caused mostly by a lack of firemen
to keep enough steam and also to the fact
that, some of the men have to fill dual
i positions. The superintendent of one com
; pany said to-day that he. had received a
number of applications from engineers in
cities % cutside the coal regions for posi
â¢ tions. Â¦ r : j Â¦ . . *
MINES SLOWLY FLOODING
The action of the New York Board of
Trade in requesting President Roosevelt
to take up the- matter of settling the
strike aroused considerable interest.
President Mitchell had nothing to say
when he was asked for an expression of
opinion on the new move.: He said he
knew : nothing about it except what he
had read in the newspapers. Mitchell
kept close to his office all day. He spent
the time in conferring with committeemen
from various parts of the coal flleds and
did an unusual amount of telephoning.
He said there -was nothing new in regard
to a settlement of the strike and ex
pressed himself, as satisfied with the pro
gress of the miners' campaign. -
Most of the companies exhuasted their
force of company employes and are now
using non-union men more freely. It was
their policy not to enlist the service of
non-union men more than was absolutely
necessary. Non-union men from the
larger cities are still coming in, most of
them being brought here under cover of
darkness. * They are sent to the collieries
during the night, because the officials do
not care to run the risk of having the col
lieries- attacked. During the day and a
part of the night the strikers are con
stantly on the watch and in a few min
utes can call out the entire population of
a mining village if necessary.
The work of the miners' pickets and the
stoning by boys and young men is having
its effect. Each- day a number of men
leave their homes for the mines, fearing
they may not again get' home' alive. It
was said at the strike headquarters that
330 additional men had joined the ranks
of the strikers to-day. The operators are
still able to fill the places of those that
desert or are forced to quit.
NON-UNION MEN COMING IN.
W1LKESBARRE, . Pa., June 5.â This
was an uneventful day in the anthra
cite coal miners' strike and probably the
quietest since the engineers, firemen a"nd
pumpmen were called out last Monday.
There were the usual scrimmages in sev
eral parts of the Wyoming Valley, in
which workmen who refused to desert the
companies generally got the worst of it.
No one, so far as known, was seriously
injured.
The interstate commerce act of June 1,
1888, empowered the President to appoint
a commission to investigate the contro
versies between the railroads and other
common carriers and their employes. It
was under this act that President Cleve
land took action in regard to the Pullman
car strike. . Â¦ *
Section 12 'Of the mediation and arbitra
tion act of 189& however, repealed this :
section of the interstate commerce law, j
which created boards of arbitration for
the settling of controversies between in
terstate carriers and their employes.
COMMISSIONERS IN DOUBT.
The act of 1898 conferred these power3
to a certain degree on 'the chairman of ;
the Interstate Commerce* Commision, so
that whenever, in his opinion, public in
terests demand, he can authorize a com
mission to use its efforts for the purpose
of arbitration and conciliation in the mat
ter of prolonged, disputes between rail
roads and their employes.
Under the law President Roosevelt does
i not feel that he has any power to ap
point a commission to investigate the
strike, as suggested by the resolutions of
the New York board. Inquiry to-day of
members of the Interstate Commerce
Commission developed a doubt in their
minds as to whether they were empower
ed to go into the matter of the coal
strike in its present stage of develop
ment.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 5.â New York' 3
Board of Trade and Transportation based
its resolutions asking Presiden| Roose
velt to take a hand in arbitrating the coal
strike on a law that does not exist. This
action has disturbed the President and
has held out false hopes to the strikers,
as news now comes from the disturbed
district that the miners are now looking:
to President Roosevelt to settle the dif
ficulty. The President has no power to
appoint a commission of arbitration and
he can only go to the extent of calling
the. situation to the attention of the In
terstate Commerce Commission in an in
formal manner. Official criticism in
Washington is that the board's resolu
tions were based on an entire misconcep
tion of the executive powers in the mat
ter.

CINCINNATI, June 5.â The Enquirer
says the Humbert-Crawford sensation of
Paris probably had its start at Covington,
Ky., and that French detectives are now
here working under instructions from
Paris and also under telegraphic advice
from Washington, through Eugene Poicey,
the French Consul at Cincinnati. It is
asserted that M. Katin, who taught French
at Covingtun years ago and afterward re
turned to Paris, has advised the French
Government all about the Crawfords,
whom he formerly knew while living in
Covington. Frank Devenek, an artist in
Cincinnati, who resides in Covington and
knew the Crawfords, has gone to Paris to
assist in the investigation that has been
started by M. Katin, who is now in the
employ of the French Government.
Four Crawford brothers lived in Coving
ton until the early eighties, when they
left there and two of them went to Paris.
The French Government had information
that they may have been the men named
in the golden-sealed and impressive-look
ing document exhibited by the Humberts
to the great financiers. The Crawford
brothers were John, Henry, Matthew and
Robert. John died years ago leaving
three brothers. Henry went to Kansas
City in l&SS and was City Clerk there.
Matthew and Robert went abroad and are
supposed to have lived in Paris. Every
circumstance indicates tnat they are the
men whom the Humberts named as the
nephews who were contesting the Craw
lord will and who were preventing the
Humberts from coming into possession of
the "great estates." The Crawfords were
considered a wealthy family in Covington
and it was understood that they had a
rich uncle. The story as related by the
Humberts to the bankers is practically
the same story of the important events in
the lives of the Covington Crawfords.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., June 5âAccord

the strength of a supposed twenty million

wnole story was founded on a fraud He
s-ays there never was an R. H. Craw-ford

ever died possessed of a twenty million

lamily. Henry Crawford is an ex-City

THE OBSTREPEROUS HOG.
It was a hard task to get that hog into
the waiting express wagon, but when onge
in the vehicle it was speedily taken to a
committee of arbitrators that had been
formed to render a true and unbiased
opinion as to whether the gallant sea
lighter'in any possible way, in look or in
manner, bore a resemblance to the porky,
as alleged by the austere and wounded
Brlrson.
The hog gave the committee much
trouble, for it even declined to be re
moved from the expressman's. charge un
til actual force had been resorted to.
It was then quickly decided that M.
Guy de St. Brisson was not warranted in
making so grave a comparison. â¢ Â¦
Brisson was sent for and came in an
swer to the sXimmons.
"Monsieur, you see that animal before
you?" broke in a well known citizen with
the wisdom of King Solomon. "Now,
monsieur, what do you call that animal
before you?" .
"Messieurs, it is incomprehensible that
you ask me. Of course it Is a hog."
"Eh blen! Pray you be careful now in
the answer to the question which I shall
put to you on the instant. . Voila! Is it in
the possibility of .nature that-you-^ee in
any gentleman present a resemblance ti
that which you call 'a hog'?"
It was a moment of anxiety. Â¦
A MOMENT OF SUSPENSE.
"Where?"
Monsieur looked around . intently; the
nervous strain was intense; Ensign Rey
pulled' himself up to full length, and sev
eral Consuls present held their laboring
and administrative breaths. The hog
emitted a squeak, but the while all atten
tion was riveted upon the Administrator
cf the Marquesas Islands. His answer
meant so much â even the possibility of
taking up a few hours' time of an over
worked Coroner. . ,
"Messieurs," broke in me outraged gen
tleman. "I see the hog!".
"Messieurs, I â¢ beg you will remember,
as my compatriots, that while I see 'the
hog,' I am at the disadvantage of being
on foreign soil, and, also It would be
against the etiquette of France to say
where. or upon what particular spot I see
'the hog.' " â¢
As M. Brisson remained obdurate and
as the International point- he had taken
was deemed perfectly legitimate, the
hog was once more placed in the waiting
express wagon and returned to the salu
brious atmosp.here of Butchertown.
The matter of the duel was then freely
discussed. . Â¦. .
"On my own^ground, on the soil of La
Belle France, I shall meet my adversary,"
Friends of the naval officer visited
Butchertown yesterday before the yards
were cleared of their porcine wonders and
a live hog of no mean proportions Was
purchased.
It was a stubborn hog, and if it had
only had the sense to have known when
The duel, as has been announced here
tofore, will be reserved for the delight of
Parisians, and will take place somewhere
In the historic grounds of the Bois de
Boulogne, under the shadow of the
Champs Elysees, if it takes place at all.
duelling, and more than one
eminent lawyer was consulted with a view
toward unraveling the difficulty' in which
Guy de St. Brisson and his opponent. En
sign Rey, and the French Consul and the
Turkish Imperial Consul and Captain
Lawless of the steamship Australia seem
to be entangled. â
The casus belli has almost been for
gotten in the serious developments that
have ensued, for the secondary position
that the "hog" played in the initial pro
ceedings has been reversed and now the
"hog" takes precedence ahd is the fat' of

Former Prominent Lumber Dealer of
Michigan Dies From the Effects
of Morphine Poisoning.
KANSAS CITY, Mo,. June 5.â John W.
Howry, once a prominent lumber dealer
of East Saginaw, Mich., and who had
Boston connections, died at the hospital
here late this afternoon from the effects
of a dose of morphine taken with sui
cidal intent on Monday night. Howry
was 70 years old. He planned his death
deliberately. He left a note to an under
taker to care for his body, and drew up a
message to be sent to his sons, J. H. and
H. K. Howry, who were associated with
him- in the cattle at Naravisa,
N. Mex. In his note he gave business
losses as the cause of suicide.
"Fight It out in American fashion," ex
claimed a recent arrival from Paris.
"Mon Dieu! I have seen what they call
the American fashion. Oh! It lacks the
polish, the finish, the clean-cut of the
methods of my country. I saw M.
Jimmy Britt and my compatriot, M. Kid
Lavigne â of course, he is French, I tell it
from the name â settle their difference in
the American fashion. There were such
what you call 'soaks' upon the face, that,
alas, I failed after the American fashion
had been demonstrated to recognize my
countryman.
"Pauvre M. Lavigne! My heart ached
for him. He cannot be accustomed to the
American fashion. No, "no, sir. The Ad
ministrator of the Marquesas Islands and
Ensign Rey must listen to no such pro
posals, for they might both finish like
mon ami and good compatriot, M. Kid
Lavigne! No, no, it is impossible! Vive le
sabre! Vive le pistolet! . A-bas the duel

Several present then resented a sugges
tion that had been made that the two
gentlemen fight it out in American fash-
Ion.

LOS ANGELES, June 5.â Six laborers
were seriously injured late to-day in a
head-end collision between two loaded
construction cars of the Los Angeles Rail
way Company at Fourteenth and Ten
nessee streets. Construction gangs have
been at work on the line and the two cars
were running in opposite directions at a
rate of speed said to be In excess of
twelve miles an hour when the cars
crashed into each other near the sharp
curve at that point. The motormen saw
each other too late to avoid the crash.

that my remains shall rest in the cata
combs of my sires. . I shall, if I am
wounded, live to honor the place where
upon I have fought -to avenge a wrong
that blood can alone wipe out. But, my
friends, I shall not be the one to fall.
Right will ever be favored and the wrong
will, must, should, shall meet its deserts."

J. X. Gillette knew that you were not his

You wanted to meet somewhere and talk

character of man you are. how unreliable you
are and how unworthy jou are to have the con
fidence and tupport of any people.
The trouble has spread to the Council
cnamoers and a peaceful meeting is a
thing of the past. At the last session a
personal conflict between Councilmen
i>uhne and Poland was prevented only by
the Intervention of Chief of Police Barnum
and members of the Council. The trouble
& rose over Buhne's allegation that the
majority of the Councilmen were in a Job

evening the He was freely passed.
In his letter Chairman Bull, after deny
ing the facts in Thompson's complaint.
PEACE IS AFFRIGHTED.
After the leaders patched up their dif
ferences and Thompson agreed to resign
after he received his commission and
placed his written resignation in the
liands of Attorney Monroe, these charges
were withdrawn. Thompson received his
appointment and then began the suit to
have his resignation returned to him. The
Bull faction declare that the Selvage affi
davits against Campbell and Milnes were
published by Thompson to provoke them
to a row that he might find an excuse to
escape from the consequences of his ob
ligation. Thompson declares that It is the
duplicity of the opposing- faction that has
induced him to brine the suit.
This letter accuses Thompson of violat
ing' his pledges and of general ' bad faith.
It was answered by Thompson In an -open
letter through the columns of his own
paper, the Standard. The Thompson let
ter accused Bull of persistently making
war on him and gave as he termed it "an
unvarnished history of the case" and in
side political facts in general.
The tight between the factions repre
eented by J. C. Bull, S. A. Campbell aud
C. S. Milnes and other leaders of the
party organization on one side and J. F.
Thompson. T. H. Selvage and A. H. Buhne
en the other began when John Bull, son
of the Republican chairman, applied for
Thompson's place at the land office, after
-Thompson, it is alleged, said he did not
â¢wish it longer. About this time charges
were preferred at Washington against
Thompson.
The suit instituted by J. F. Thompson,
Receiver of the United States Land Of
fica, against J. C. Bull Jr.. chairman of
the Republican Central Committee; S. A.
Campbell. Collector of the Port, and At
torney A. J. Monroe to restrain them from
presenting Thompson's written resignation
of the receivership, brought forth an open
letter from Bull, published in the Timts
this morning.

"it will probably be met with opposition.''
LONDON, June 5.â The . negotiations of
the British and the Canadian governments
and . some of the other colonial govern
ments with the Cunard line and other
lines comprising what fs now termed the
Liverpool syndicate, which is opposing
the Morgan shipping combine, contem
plate, according to" the Westminster Gaj
zette, both a fast service of mall and pas
senger steamers in conjunction with the
Canadian Pacific Railroad and a fleet of
fast freight steamers. The mail steamers
which it is proposed to build will be of
enormous size, capable of steaming twen
ty-five knots an hour, and will be fully
equipped for use^ as armed cruisers, carry
ing- eight quick-firing six-inch guns for
ward and aft, arid broadsides of three 4.7
inch guns. The freight steamers will be
sixteen-knot vessels, carrying 6000 to 7000
tons dead weight. The Westminster Ga
zette thinks it probable that Milford Ha
ven will be the port of departure of the
fleet. The scheme contemplates a line of
steamers running to China, Japan and
Australia from Vancouver, B. C. Canada
and Australia are expected to join in pay
ing the subsidies.
In any event, M. Combes seemed deter
mined to fulfill his mission, as failure
would be interpreted as meaning that the
Radical party is incapable of assuming
the responsibility of power.
It seems that M. Combes will be Pre
mier and Minister of the Interior in the
new Cabinet, that M. Delcasse, General
Andre and M. Leygues, formerly Min
isters of Foreign Affairs, War and Pub
lic Instruction respectively, will be re
tained, and that Deputies M. Troui
llot (Republican). M. Etienne (Re
publican), M. Rouvler (Republican), AÂ£.
Dubouese (Radical Republican) and M.
Deumergue (Radical Republican), will also
be given portfolios. While the appoint
ments of these last named are considered
certain, there Is some doubt regarding the
selection of M. Rouvier, who is slated for
the post of Minister of Finance. Thia
doubt arises from M. Rouvier' s position
on the Income tax question.
XAter in the day Senator Combes, Pro
gressive Republican and former Vice
President of the Senate, accepted the task
of forming a new Cabinet. ,
After leaving the Elysee Palace.- M.
Combes conferred with M. Waldeck-
Rousseau, the former Premier and the
President of the Senate and Chamber of
Deputies. He will begin his negotiations
for the formation of a Cabinet at once
and expects to- be ready to announce his
Ministry in Sunday's issue of the Official
Journal.
PARIS, June 5.â M. Henri Brlsson, the
former Premier, who is a Radical Re
publican In politics, went to the Elysee
Palace to-day as a result of President
Loubet's summons and was asked to form
a new Cabinet, but M. Brisson declined.
It Is reported that M. Largentainage
will be prosecuted for insulting Presi
dent Loubet.
"We informed M. Bachimont of the
object of our visit. He replied to our
communication. He replied â (here fol
lows a filthy expression which is unprint
able in English). The Count de Dion
retorted by slapping his face."
M. Bachimont, to the foregoing, pub
lished this terse reply:
"Count de Dion says he slapped my
face. This is a lie." . .
Deputy Bachimont having called M.
Millevoye a scoundrel, the latter sent M.
Bachimont his seconds, the Count de
Dion and M. de Largentainage, who, in
their official account of the interview,
said:
The fight occurred In a committee
room. In wjiich the Deputies were en
gaged In the verification of the recent
election returns. The dispute which
caused it arose over Nationalist posters,
in which Republicans were attacked in
violent language. Several of the Nation
alist Deputies to-day approved these ex
pressions, and in the row which followed
the participants frequently exchanged in
sults such as "blackguard" and "thief."
An officail of the Chamber had to inter
vene between the combatants.
A scrimmage, during which fisticuffs
were exchanged, followed, half a dozen
Deputies, including the Count de Dion,
M. Millevoye and M. Meslier, taking part
in the fighting.
A number of Republican Deputies re
torted hotly, whereupon M. de Largen
tainage added, excitedly: "And your
President of the republic is a thief!"
PARIS, June 6.â In a committee room
of the Chamber of Deputies to-day M.
Largentalnage, a Reactionary Deputy
from the Cotes du Nord, exclaimed:
"Yes; you Republicans are swindlers and
traitors, and, in a way, foreigners!"

TOPEKA, Kan., June 5.â The officials
of the Santa Fe are at a loss to explain
the trouble with the boiler-makers at San
Bernardino. Colonel A. H. Henderson,
superintendent of motive power of the
joad, is the only official acquainted with
the strike situation and he is on the scene
trying to adjust matters. Some think
that the trouble may extend to the mam
lines of the road, but the officials say
there is little danger of this.
The boiler-makers deplore the necessity of
resorting to a strike to secure a fair and just
wage for service rendered at Needles, but
alter thirty daj's' discussion of the question
fcy the company and the employes they were
riven a definite answer by the company's of
ficial that a raise of from $3 50 to $4 would not.
be granted, hence the strike.
The Southern Pacific Company pays boiler
makers $4 at Tucson. Ariz., and El Paso. Tex.
Tiie Texas and Pacific Railroad pays boiler
rnaker8 $4 per day at El Paso, Tex., and the
Rock Island pays $i at Alamogorda, N. M.
All these towns are Elmilar to Xeedles and to
tome extent more desirable as places of resi
dence. The expense of living amounts to 20
to 80 per cent less at the places named. Hence,
the boiler-makers at Needles believe that they
are asking- nothing but what is fair and Just.
The boiler-makers at Xeedles, Cal. (and
through Fympathy, these in this city) feel Jus
tified in their demand for a raise of 25 cents
per day, because they are only asking for the
prevailing rate of wages paid by other rail
roads under like conditions.
Of the Eastern men brought in last
night not one went to work to-day, so far
as could be learned, and nearly all ol
them have left the quarters assigned to
them by the company, stating that th>?y
did not understand the situation when
they engaged themselves to come here.

resort to violence. No one not known to
he In the employ of the railroad company
is allowed to enter the shop grounds.
The following official statement was
made to-day by the Boiler-makers' Union
in this city:
SAX BERNARDINO, June 5. â No
trouble has occurred among the
strikers at the Santa Fe machine
shops at this point, but there
has been much agitation over the arrival
of a carload of boiler-makers from the
East, brought here to take the place of
Ftriking workmen. Another carload of
mechanics is due here to-night, and In
order to be prepared for any trouble
Sheriff Rouse, at the request of the rail
road Â¦ company, has sworn in more guards
for service at the shops and railroad
yards.
Ellis has taken in Mart Foster and two
others as partners. They could not keep
the discovery, which is close to the road,
a secret, and one of the partners watches
the place at night while the others sleep.
Prospectors have located every foot of
t.he ground for nearly a mile in every di
"rection and other strikes are anticipatecl.
The owners of the "Little Wax" ledge
refuse to listen to any offers for their
mine.
Not less remarkable than the ledge It
self Is the manner in which It came to
be discovered. A man told of the sup
posed ledge as a Joke and a miner proved
the joke a reality. One night last week
in a French Gulch store a crowd of min
ers and others were spinning yarns. Mart
Foster, who -is not a miner, .told of a
ledg\s which he knew must exist beside
the county road at the base of the Shasta
divide, because he had picked up a bit of
quartz there twelve years ago which
sparkled with gold.
William Ellis, a miner, heard the story
and set out early next morning for the
rpot which Foster had described. ,-He lo
cated the little gulch without difficulty
and before night he had located a ledge
which cropped out at the surface. He
returned next day greatly elated and
opened up the vein. The pay streak is
more than two feet wide and assays from
2100 to $500 per ton. It has been opened
up for about 100 feet and gives no sign of
pinching out.
REDDING, June 5.â A hundred mining
claims have been staked within four days
and scores of miners are hurrying to the
district as the result of the finding of
what promises to be a great gold ledge
at the western base of the Shasta divide,
ten miles this side of French Gulch.

SAN JOSE, June 5.â The newspaper men
of San Jose were the guests of the Elks'
publicity, press and promotion commit
tee at a banquet last midnight. About a
dozen were present, including representa
tives of the local papers and the corre
spondents of the San Francisco papers.
An elaborate menu was served in the
banquet room at the new hall of the Elks.
It was well into the morning before the
jovial crowd dispersed, and the newspa
per men are enthusiastic over the way
the Elks royally sustained their reputa
tion for lavish hospitality. Jackson
Hatch, exalted ruler of the Elks, was
toaslmaster. Toasts were responded to
as follows: "Our Country," John E.
Richards; "The Press," E. K. Johnston;
"The Influence of the Press Upon the
Commercial World," L. E. Bontz; "Rem
iriscences," Dr. D. F. McGraw. Fred L.
Thomas recited "Thanatopsis." â¢
Jackson Hatch, -who is general manager
of the Elks' circus to be given July 4,
outlined the plan of "the greatest show
on earth." He said the 300 Elks in San
Jose are going to turn circus men for the
delight of the people. A big amphitheater
will bo erected on Santa Clara and Sixth
streets. There will be the main show and
the always present sideshows. There will
be amateur and professional actors.
Everything will be there Just as in the
three-ring shows, the sawdust ring, the
side shows with the wild man from
Borneo and the bearded lady. San Jose
society and professional men will do bare
back stunts, sell popcorn- and lemonade
and "spiel" for the shows. The circus is
also to be made a gathering for the Elks
all over the State. Fully 15,000 people are
expected to attend the show. San Fran
cisco and Oakland Elks are coming with
a special excursion.
Wheelock to-day made a statement of a
sensational nature in which he alleges will
ful neglect on the part of his attorney.
The prisoner was convicted of murdering
a woman In Oroville about two years ago.
He has wealthy relatives in the East who,
he says, assert tfiat they paid an attorney
named "Grosvenor, of Oroville,. J150Q. to ap
peal the case to the Supreme Court.
Grosvenor he alleges, lodged the appeal
but never filed the briefs in the case. The
matter came up twice before the Supreme
Court and was postponed . because the
briefs in the ease were not on' file. At
each time, Wheelock says, the lawyer was
notified of this fact and -was told to file
such briefs. The date of the hanging was
set for June 14. ' * "
Wheel ock's relatives in the East were
apprised of the situation and being per
sonal friends of Governor Odell, of New
York, interceded with him before he left
New York on his Western tour to see
Governor Gage and lay, the matter before
him in order to obtain a stay of execu
tion. Governor Odell, when in California,
it is asserted, did see Governor Gage, and
discussed the matter fully with him, but
up to the present time no action has been
taken in the matter. Wheelock Is 47 years
old.

the Sacramento Valley communities have
prepared to entertain. There will be

The aim of the San Franciscans is to
promote the prosperity of the interior of
California. To do this intelligently it has
been deemed best by the California Pro

of the violent crimes in the Chinese quar

that such things must not continue. Al

Sold Morphine Without Prescription.
Dr. T. J. Rees, salesman in Baily's
drug store, Sutter street and Grant ave

Cabaniss' court yesterday on a charge of
selling morphine without a physician's
prescription and was sentenced to pay a
line of $200, with the alternative of serv
ing 100 days in the County Jail. It was
contended for the defense that, as the de
fendant was a physician, although sales
man in the drug store, the ordinance -did
not apply to him, but the Judge ruled
against him, holding that selling 25 cents'
worth of morphine was not filling a pre
scription. '.
Up to a late hour yesterday no one had
applied at the morgue for possession of
the bodies, and if some other arrangement
is not made before Saturday evening the
remains will be buried in the potter's

' Chew Lang. On received a gash extend

his cheek was split. He also received
severe cuts on the right leg and arm,
besides numerous abrasions of other
parts of his body. A physician sewed up
the wounds and last night the victim was
sufficiently recovered to tell his story out
of the corner of his mouth.
Apparently the two prisoners were get

friendliness. For the last three days,
however, according to Chew Lang On's
story, the . convict has been making
threats. He told his cellmate he was go
ing to kill him at the first opportunity,
but the victim regarded the threat.as a
merry jest and went about his narrow
quarters in fancied security.
The attack was made when Chew was
slumbering. The assailant secured the
heavy wooden cover of the toilet, and
creeping In the dark to his victim's side,
rained blow after blow on \ the prostrate

The firemen, William Burns, Ed McGon-
Igle and Sam Powell by name, were
standing in front of the fire house when
they heard a woman scream. She was
standing at the junction of Hyde and
California streets and a middle sized man
was dashing down the street in an evident
attempt to escape. They at once jumped
to the conclusion that a robbery had been
committed. They gave chase and after a
sprint of several blocks overtook the flee
ing man. He denied the charge of snatch
ing the purse, but the woman positively
identified him. The firemen neglected to
get her name or address and this duty
will devolve upon Â£he police.
On the prisoner when he was searched
at the City Prison were found two purses,
one. of which contained $75 in gold. There
have been seven complaints of Â¦ purse
snatching from this vicinity in the past
three weeks and it is supposed that the
same man committed all the crimes.
Three firemen from engine house No. 3
captured an alleged purse snatcher on
California street last evening and brought
him to the City Prison, where be was
turned over to Detectives Dlnan and
Wren. He gave the name of Albert White
and he was placed In the tanks until evi
dence against him can be secured.
The machine manipulators â¢ count on
some support from Sacramento. That
place seems to be the headquarters of the
Gage literary bureau. It is observed that
sympathetic notices in the Record-Union,
wherein his Gageship is exalted and laud
ed as a fearless economist, are copied in
half a dozen other papers of like obscur
ity. The most consistent and by far the
ablest of the Gage press is the Acton
Rooster. The Sacramento supporters of
the Gage machine will not put a straight
out ticket in the field, but will endeavor
to win delegates under the cover of AI
Johnston's candidacy for State Printer.
Before the primary election takes place
Johnston's supporters may find it pru
dent to publicly disavow any connection
with the gubernatorial figfet. Two months
ago Humboldt County was regarded as a
sure shot for Gage, but things political
up there are not as they were. Gage dele
gates north of Sacramento will be re
markably scarce. E. B. Edson will come
to the convention with quite a bunch from
the north. The push politicians insist
that Gage will be the second choice of the
Edson strength, but the claim seems to
rest on a shadowy foundation. It is the
judgment of the best posted politicians
that Gage's name will not be presented to
the convention.
COUNT ON SUPPOBT.
Major Frank McLaughlin arrived in the
city from Santa Cruz yesterday. The
story that he was advocating the nomina
tion of General Georg-e Stone for Gov
ernor was put up to him. He remarked
that he was glad that he had been de
tected so early. He knew that the Re
publican party would never forgive him
and Jie could never forgive himself for
getting into such a fight. He felt that
only divine assistance would save him if
he should get into a Stone camp. The
beautiful bouquets which the major and
Colonel Dan used to bestow on his Excel
lency have lost their freshness and fra
grance. In fact, there is no incense in the
Palace court except the Insensibility of
the push to the undoing of Gage.
Gage does not cut very much of a fig
ure in the race for the Republican nomi
nation for Governor. He will hardly get
a corporal's guard of delegates in San
Francisco. The county committee will
not touch him, as that organization has
no use for a known loser. The machine
seems to be wrecked beyond repair. The
old-time manipulators console themselves
with the hope that the railroad political
bureau will get in behind the Democratic
nominee for Governor. The Gage glim
was doused in the San Jose election when
Johnny Mackenzie was beaten.
Mclaughlin arbives.
It is fortunate for the people of Califor
nia that the truth concerning the shame
ful condition of affairs at San Quentin
â¢was foreshadowed early in the political
campaign. The public is inclined to view
with suspicion charges sprung on the eve
of election, but revelations coming two
months ahead of the primary election and
nearly three months before the meeting
of the nominating convention cannot be
ignored nor suppressed.
It is in the power of the people to elect
to the Legislature resolute men who will
stand for the honor and integrity of the
public service and who will demand, de
spite executive interference, that prison
scandals shall be properly investigated.
It will be the duty of the next Legisla
ture to amend the law so that the State
Treasurer will have a voice in the pur
chase of bonds for the school fund. Re
cently in the absence of the principals
of the State Board of Examinersâ the
Governor, Attorney General'and Secretary
of State â two appointed deputies, Kevane
and Post, paid $16,000 more for a block of
Kern County bonds than the securities
were worth in the market. The people
of California will not tolerate much of
this kind of work with the school fund.

Senator Cutter will never forgive him
self for the part he took in defeating the
Belshaw resolution for an investigation of
the State prisons during the recess of the
Senate. The resolution had been adopted
and it was up to Lieutenant Governor
Neff as the presiding officer of the Senate
to appoint the committee of five, when
Governor Gage intervened and implored
his friends in the Senate to rescind the
resolution. Facts surely will be brought
fj light, when a thorough and searching
investigation of San Quentin takes place,
that 'will show the public why the execu
tive did not want the inquiry. Senator
Belshaw was right when he proposed that
there should be a committee of five. By
this time the Governor must be convinced
that the Marin and Contra Costa Senator
was correct. According to gossip the
Governor started in to investigate on his
own account last "Wednesday. Yesterday
he was obliged to call to his assistance
the newly appointed Prison Director, War
ren Porter of Monterey, and the "Banjo."
To-morrow he may feel constrained to
si-nd for Johnny Mackenzie, Walter
iloore and Ed Xiles. This addition would
make a committee equal in numbers to
the one proposed by Senator Belshaw.
There were frequent mesages from San
Quentin yesterday which signified to the
push that the "fearless executive" was
up against the real goods.

Bank Teller Gives His
Story, of the Battle
at Moraghan's.
C. J. McGlynn, paying, teller of the Hi
bernia Bank, had an opportunity yester
day, of telling his version of the fight In
Moraghan's oyster parlors in the Cali
fornia market on the night of May 21, his
part In which led to. his arrest on a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon
preferred by John Buhmann, cashier of
the eating place. .
McGlynn' s story was told to Police
Judge Fritz, before whom his preliminary
examination was begun yesterday. The
bank teller's story is that he and a friend
went to Moraghan's to eat; that after
he paid the check there was 40 cents
change coming to him, which the cashier
refused v to give him; that he said he
would take the 40 cents due him from the
cash register and that thereupon the fight
commenced, McGlynn and his friend be
ing mixed up in a battle with five em
ployes of the restaurant, the trouble only
ceasing when McGlynn -had been brutally
clubbed into insensibility by Special Of
ficer G. H. Porter. ~O*
Attorney Stephen Costello specially
prosecuted and the defendant was repre
sented by Attorney Stafford. Joseph
Tobin was an interested spectator of the
proceedings
The witnesses for, the prosecution were
John Buhmann, the complaining witness;
B. White, cook; Joseph Leon, waiter; G.
H. Porter, special officer; Policemen E. F.
Leonard and A. A. Hicks, Ed Kempke
and Louis Fontanel. The first four tes
tified that McGlynn struck Buhmann with
a bottle and tried to get at the cash regis
ter. They said he was under the influence
of/Hciuor, but Leonard and Hicks said
that, thoug-h he had been drinking, he
was not drunk. When they arrived on
the scene his head, face and clothing were
covered with blood from wounds on his
heads. '.-. ' - â - Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ '
â "After my friend and myself had eaten
a plate of oysters each," testified Mc-
Glynn, "I took the check, which called
for 60 cents, and laid it Â¦ on the counter
with $1. After waiting for some moments
for my change, I said to Buhmann, 'What
about my 40 cents?' He insultingly re
plied that; he." had given , me the change,
called me a liar and said, 'You- can't rob
me.' I said, 'If you don't give it to me
I'll take it from, the register. Then Buh
mann struck ma on the face, dazing me.
Before I could do anything a waiter and
a dishwasher or cook came running up
and attacked me. The cook struck me
twice on the head with a poker, and as
I was afraid for my life, I seized a caper
sauce' "bottle to defend myself. Â¦ Before I
could use it I was struck with a club
from behind and . fell to the floor uncon
scious. I bled very profusely and on com
ing to. asked Officer Hicks to send for a
physician, but was sent, to the Emer
gency Hospital. No one showed a star
before I was struck. I was not under the
influence of liquor and did not use vulgar
language." . Â¦ .-.Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
More witnesses for the defense will be
examined * next Thursday, to which date
the case has been continued.

Those are strong words, but they are not the first
of the kind that have come from St. Louis since" the
first revelation was made of the bribery of city offi
cials for the purpose of obtaining from them a street
railway franchise. It is time for St. Louis to do some
thing more than to publish a story of her official
shame. The issue before her people is one of action.
The country hasbeen told often enough that the tax
payers have been robbed, that public franchises have
been sold, that municipal money has been wasted and
that the confidence and the interests of the people
have been betrayed by their representatives in office.
That which the country now wishes to know is what
St. Louis is going to do about it.
OUT of the investigation into the secrets of*the
past municipal "administration in * that city,
the St. Louis Grand Jury has brought to
light facts which lead it to say: "While there may
have been corruption in other cities as great as we
have had here, yet at no place in the world arid at no
time known to history has so much official corrup
tion been uncovered and the evidence shown so that
all could see and understand. These revelations have
been so appalling as to be almost beyond belief, and
it will be years before the extent of the discoveries is
fully realized."

-The decrease in the weight of the battery will of
itself bean immense gain, but another advantage is
said to lie in the rapidity with Which the new bat
tery can be charged. Altogether the promise {is a
most attractive one, for the success of such a battery
means- of course not only a great improvement in
automobiles, but also theÂ« solution of the problem* of
running electric cars under all conditions without
the use of overhead wires. Â¦'.. V 1
The showing is unquestionably good, but as it
takes more than one swallow to make a spring, so
it takes more than one test to prove that a new ma
chine is equal to all the demands that are going to
be made upon it. -Edison is quoted as saying that
in most of the storage batteries now in use lead is
used in a solution of acid, and as a consequence the
batteries are very heavy, weighing about 125 pounds
for each horsepower produced. He gets rid of the
weight by using lighter metals than lead, and says he
can- get one-horsepower for every 53.3 pounds of
weight. He expects to get the weight -'down to
forty pounds per horsepower in another battery ht
is now constructing. His expectation is that with
the lighter batteries it will be possible for, an auto
mobile to make 100 miles without recharging. ' ., :
, Edison himself believes the tests made have been
sufficient. He says: "I sent my two men, Bee and
Fleiss, out on the road and told them to run the
machine over some rough roads and tackle a few
bad hills. Well, they did it. They ran sixty-two
miles, took seventy-five hills, with grades ranging
from 2 to 12 per. cent, went through some big holes
and came back with 83 per cent of the speed they
went out with and the voltage . had only dropped
seven volts from the original twenty-nine. That was
fairly good, but it didn't, satisfy me. I told 'em to
go out again and they started on Monday, when the
roads were heavy from the rain. My "instructions
were to run the blamed machine until she stopped,
and they did eighty-five miles before she slowed
down."
An inventor with' a new machine is very much like
a woman with a new baby. Mr. Edison is a man of
eminence, and yet few people will put absolute re
liance upon his estimate, of his invention. â¢Â¦ It is, nat
ural he should deem it the greatest thing of the
kind on earth, but the public will wish to subject it
to the test of actual work before accepting it as a
complete solution of- the storage battery problem.
EDISON has repeated with additional details
his statement of a few days ago that he has
achieved the construction of a storage battery
which will greatly improve automobiles. He asserts
that his invention will give the machines a running
power which will enable them to make a long mile
age without renewal, will not require expensive
care, will not depreciate in use and will not weigh
more than the vehicle it propels. . In short, he is
guoted as saying: "It is now 1 up to the manufac
turers of automobiles to provide a cheap carriage. I
have solved the problem of an electric storage bat
tery which can be used for long distance work and
which will wear two or three automobiles out before
it succumbs itself."

ULSTER COUNTY GAZETTEâSub

It is said that some of the Boers who have been
txiled may elect to come to the United States and
it is quite likely that many Cape Colonists who are
free to do so may seek an asylum here in preference
to enduring disfranchisement there. If so they will
be gladly welcomed. We cannot have too many im
migrants of their sort.
Americans are interested in the fact that when the
Boers and British broke out in song together they
sought as a means of expressing their feelings two
old American songs, "Hard Times Come Again No
More" and "Old Folks at Home."
The scenes after the treaty was signed furnish that
touch of nature without which the incident would
make less powerful appeal to the world's imagina
tion. The Boers dropped their austerity and the
British their reserve and there ensued a fraternal
mingling that makes the combined future of the two
more promising. There was no appearance of victor
and vanquished. The conqueror and the conquered
â¢did not appear. It was a free and cordial mingling of
men and equals. The pleasure was general and not
partial. What the Beers had lost in the field was
gained by their diplomacy, and what the British lost
in diplomacy they had gained in the field. There were
no illusions and no pretenses; Beyers and Botha,
Delarey and the giant De Wet were the equals of
Kitchener and Milner. There was no air of subjuga
tion about them.
We desire to repeat that the result is of distinct
benefit to the world. If Great Britain has been com
pelled by the emergencies of her situation to grant
terms that lower her prestige it is a warning 'to other
powers to avoid adventures and aggressions which
may put them under the same necessity. If the
Boers have saved their honor, as they have, and at
the same time secured terms favorable to their fu
ture, it is encouragement to all people who are at
tacked aggressively to sacrifice and endure until the
aggressor respects their power and dare not humili
ate them.
Great Britain may be sure of one thing: If her
terms and engagements in the treaty be faithfully
observed she has gained in the Boers a people of
whom any country may be proud. The exchange of
compliments after the treaty was much more than
a formality. It had the heartiness of sincerity. The
Boers would not be humiliated. During the con
ference they preserved their austere and distant and
independent demeanor and gave the true impression
of their reserve force and. unexhausted capacity to
fight for their rights as men and a community. The
knowledge on the part of the British members of
the conference that this was no pretense greatly aid
ed the conclusion of terms honorable to both parties.
THE closing scenes of the conference at Ve
reeniging are pieasanter reading than the
world has had from South Africa for a long
time. General Kitchener greatly redeemed his repu
tation by his conduct there and his praise of the great
deeds of the Boers in defense of their homes and
their independence. It is useless to say now that if
such a spirit had been earlier shown the world would
have been spared the pain of many things it will
gladly forget.

It is pleasant to read in this connection of the policy
of the Diamond Match Company, which has recently
acquired a tract of 50,000 acres of timber in this State
to be put under scientific forest management. That
company has also bought great tracts, of denuded
forest' land in New England and by replanting- it with
pine has now fine forests growing where 'a few years
ago the landscape was bare and forbidding. If others
who are taking over cur timber lands will administer,
them so as to make their forests perpetual their in
vestment in this State will be welcomed as in line
with our permanent prosperity.
California has the largest variety of valuable coni
fers found grouped together anywhere in the world.
On vast tracts in our mountains these have been ex
terminated by fire. There should be a large domes
tic market for seeds to. replace the forests that have
been sacrificed to greed and carelessness..
Their example should be. studied by our lawmakers.
When the owners of large timber tracts in this State
make Jntelligent rules for cutting and for protection
of the growing crop from fire, those rules may well
be enacted^into law for the control and compulsion of
the thoughtless and careless. More attention should
be paid to preserving the seeds of our valuable forest
trees for planting. It is not generally known . that
there is a great and profitable industry long in opera
tion irk this State which gathers the seeds of our valu
able conifers for sale in Europe, where they are used
in creating the -forests of the future,, on American
stock. . â¢ â¢ '
Now thepractical lumbermen are employing those
same scientific foresters to direct the cutting of their
treesand to preserve the forest-producing^capacity of
their timber tracts. The experience of Michigan,
Wisconsin and Minnesota in the complete destruc
tion of their pine forests, and conversion of the land
wftere they grew into infertile desert, has not been
lost even upon the men who profited by it. They are
now compelled to resort to the forests of the South
and to this coast for timber and lumber, and they
are rapidly falling into line with the policy of making
the timber crop permanent by care in harvesting and
replanting. . ' . .- .
THE t late J. Sterling Morton was the founder of
Arbor day, for the planting^ of trees. The
present advance in- American forestry and wide
spread public attention thereto are due directly to
his work of a lifetime to convince men "and Govern
ments of the influence of forests upon all the physical
and material interests of man. He was president of
the International Forestry Association and was
known all over the world as the foremost promoter of
forest planting and preservation. The beneficial
spread of .his ideas is now becoming apparent. 1 Not
long ago a scientific forester was regarded by prac
tical lumbermen as' a pernicious 'sort of crank, who
interfered with 1 the cbnversion of trees into timber
and lumber and ought ,to be suppressed. .
FORESTRY.
"Wiston's First Book" In Fisher Un
wln's first novel series has been such
a success that there has been a natural
curiosity as to the authorship. "Miles
Amber" was, of course, a "nom de
guerre." I am now led to understand it
stands for Mrs. Cobden Slckert, daugh
ter of Richard Cobden, whose mother, as
John Morley says in his biography, bore
the gracious name of Millicent Amber.
There was also a "Miles" In the Cobden
family.
Discussing this matter with particular
regard to novels, the Publisher's Circular
comes to the conclusion that with a few
exceptions the series of copyrighted
books in uniform bindings is doing badly.
How different from- what it used to be!
There was a time, and that not so long
ago, when a good addition to a good
series, or even an Indifferent - addition,
could command a definite advance In sub
scription. Now a novel is published on its
own account, and appears on the whole to
stand a better chance. The truth is be
lieved to be that the series was held out
to the public as a bait. When the baits
became too plentiful the public refused
to be caught.
The current number contains somo
beautiful prints which would be hard to
beat even in America. Take, for instance,
the full page reproductions in various
tints of "Repairing the Scythe," after
the painting by' Robert Steel; "Mater
Amabilis," from the painting by Edmond
Theodore Van Hove; "Polish Peasants,"
from the painting by Ferdinand AndrJ;
"A Vision of Valhalla," by Charles Rob
inson, and about half a dozen others.
They are allâ the last named especiallyâ
delightfully done. Then, as specimens of
American newspaper art work, the Studio.
devotes two full pages to reproductions
of the portrait of Alphonse Daudet, from
Carriere's portrait, and "The Germanic
in Drydock," both from the New York
Herald, as illustrating the excellence to
which this branch of newspaper work
has been brought by the Herald. ,
Is the series of library form of publica
tion played out?
Booksellers here report that the appall
ing disasters in the West Indies have
caused a very great demand for Bulwer
Iiytton's "Last Days of Pompeii." Sev
eral publishing houses are racing each
other to get out new issues to catch the
sales before the interest begins to wane.

expectation being that the Bibles will be

Several years ago a great stir was made
in society circles by the publication of an
anonymous book entitled "The Silver
Domino." This was partly because it
treated of some English social and lit
erary lions with an air of Intimate frank
ness. There. Is now to be a reissue of the
book with new chapters, while the old
ones will be brought up to date. Thus a
popular writer, poet or society gentleman
gets lively guidance as to the coat3 of
arms he should adopt in case of his re
ceiving coronation honors. The author of
"The Silver Domino" remains anonymous.

this country that England is far behind
the United States in the quality of Its art
printing. It is therefore a treat to turn

The Senate, passed the military acad
emy appropriation bill providing for ex
tensive improvements at "West Point.
Mitchell urged that unless the Nicar
agua route was" determined upon def
initely by Congress it would mean the in
definite postponement, and perhaps the ul
timate defeat of any canal legislation. He
insisted that the Nicaragua route was
entirely feasible and practicable, while the
Panama route involved difficulties which
were scarcely to be surmounted.
Hanna referred. to the seismic disturb
ances in the canal region, and suggested
that those disturbances ought to cause
the American Congress to pause and con
sider the suggested dangers seriously. He
referred to the maps arranged around the
walls of the 'chamber showing the num
ber of active and Inactive volcanoes In the
canal region, estimating that there were
more volcanoes In the neighborhood of
the Nicaragua route than that of the
Panama route. - He maintained that the
cost of the Nicaragua canal would be Im
mensely greater In point of construction
and operation . than the Panama canal,
and said ho was prepared to demonstrate
that the Nicaragua canal could not be op
erated at night. Mr. . Hanna said that
in many respects the same conditions ap
plied to both the Nicaragua and Panama
routes.
Seldom has a Senator been accorded a
more attentive hearing than that given
to Hanna. The Panama route he consid
ered much to be preferred to the Nicar
agua, as It provided an lnteroceanid wa
terway much shorter, and one that could
be traversed at a less expense. than the
Nicaragua route.
WASHINGTON, June 5.-In further
consideration of the Isthmian canal pro
ject the Senate heard two speeches to
day, neither of which was completed.
Hanna of Ohio spoke in favor of ..he
Spooner amendment conferring on the
President authority to purchase the
rights of the Panama Canal Company -f a
title could be obtained, otherwise he shall
decide upon the Nicaragua route. Mitch
ell of Oregon supported the Hepburn bill
for the construction of the canal^by the
Nicaragua route. â¢*â¢Â»

I welcome you here. I am glad to have the
chance of seeing you and wish to say a word
of congratulation to you upon this association.
All our modern life we have found it absolutely"
indispensable to supplement the work of the in
dividual by the work of individuals gathered
into an association. Without this work of the
association you cannot give the highest ex
pression to . the Individual endeavor, and It
would be a great misfortune if the military
members of the surgical and medical profes
sions did not take every advantage of. their
opportunities in the same way that is taken
by the members of the medical and
surgical professions who are not in the
army or the navy or the marine hos
pital service, but who are in civil life outside.
I am glad to see you, gathered In this associa
tion, and just one word of warning. Perfect
yourselves as scientific men, able to work with
the best and most delicate apparatus, and never
for one moment forget especially the higher
officers among: you,, that In time of need you
will have to do your work with the scantiest
poslble apparatus (laughter and applause),
and that then your usefulness will be propor
tioned; hot upon the adequacy of the complaint
that you did not have apparatus enough, but
upon the way you have done with what you
have. (Loud applause.) Remember that, and
remember also (this applies especially to the
higher officers) that you have got to supple
ment in your calling the work of the surgeon
with the work [ of the administrator. (Ap
plause.) Tou have got to be doctors and mili
tary men. and able administrators. I thank
you.
ONE WORD OF WARNING.
- It has been ray good fortune, gentlemen,
to see your body at work In the field, %p see
them carrying the wounded and dying from
the line, themselves as much exposed to danger
as those they were rescuing, and to see them
working day and night in the field hospitals
afterwards, when even the* intensity of the
strain could hardly keep them awake, so fagged
out were they by having each to do the work
of ten. (Applause.)
Mr. President, Ladles and Gentlemen: I am
glad to have the opportunity to bid welcome to
the members of this association and their
friends to-day. The men of this association
combine two professions, 'each of. which is
rightfully held in high honor by all capable
of appreciating the real work of men â the pro
fession of the soldier and the profession of the
doctor. Conditions in modern civilization tend
more and more to make the average life of the
community one of great softness, of great ease,
compared to what has been ' the case in the
past, and, gentlemen, together with all the ad
vantages that have come from this softening
of life, this rendering it more easy, there are
certain attendant "disadvantages also. It is a
very necessary thing that there should be some
professions, some trades where the same de
mands are made now as have been made in
the past upon the heroic qualities in a man,
and these demands are made alike upon the
soldier, and upon the doctor, and how much
more upon those who are both soldiers and
doctors; uport the men who have continually
to face all the responsibilities and all_ the risk
faced by their brothers in the civilian branch
of the profession, and who also in time of war
must face the same risks, often exactly the
same risks, that are faced by their brothers in
arms whose training is to kill and not to cure.
(Laughter and applause.)

WASHINGTON, June 5.â Before an as

ater President Roosevelt to-day opened
â¢the eleventh annual convention , of the
Association of Military Surgeons^of the
United States. On the stage with the
President! were Secretary Moody, Secre
tary Root,, Secretary Shaw, General
Sternberg of the army, Surgeon General

man of the Marine Hospital service; Pres
ident H. B. McFarland of the Board of

bia, and Major George Henderson, sur
general of the National Guard of the Dis
trict of Columbia and- chairman of the
committee on arrangements.
Suppression of testimony is always resented. The
people demand- the- confidence, of those who serve
them, and it is wise counsel to advise that all appear
ance of withholding it be avoided.
With Weir's report is also divulged the indorse
ment of Captain West, who, after investigation, says
that the charges are true. '
It may be said, also, that the people were not favor
ably impressed by the appearance of anxiety on the
part of some members of the Senate Philippine Com
mittee to suppress testimony. It is the judgment of
the best friends, of the administration that the mi
nority on that committee should have been just as
free in calling witnesses as the majority. The many
refusals of such freedom enable the Democrats to go
before the people and accuse the RepUblicaris'of sup
pressing evidence upon the most important subject
that is now in focus. The very appearance of such
suppression should be avoided. In the hands; of art
ful men that which is suppressed takes 'on ; propor
tions that it would not have if it were frankly re-,
vealed. Party leaders should not forget that senti
ment is a swinging pendulum. It may be at one en
treme of the arc to-day, but it does not rest there.
All the forces on. earth cannot hold it still.' The War
Department may prove that Miles went at midnight
to the War Department, disguised in a" Icing coat and
false whiskers, and opened a desk with a skeleton
key to get the Weir report and 'make it public, but
that will only momentarily divert public attention
from the main question: Is the Weir report true?

their necks; were these Apache tactics pursued by
American officers, under the American flag; by
authority held in the name of the American people?
The people of this country expect in the future to
live at- peace with the islanders as an impinged peo
ple, connected with us but not of us, or they expect
to permit them to be independent' and in friendly alli
ance with us. In either case it is necessary that we
teach them that our civilization is not a fair weather
article, but is warranted to stand every test and
wear well under every provocation. It is already in
evidence that we have shot prisoners. The excuses
for General Smith's order that all people over ten
years of age be shot do not meet with popular ap
proval. The American people do not indorsa the
military policy of punishing the chief men of a vil
lage because others in the same village have turned
to marauding. They will not vote against the admin
istration because they disapprove these things, but
they will refuse support to any administration that
conceals facts from them and treats them -as un
worthy of its confidence. This is the great danger
that lies in the whole matter. It will not be averted
-by proving that the Weir report leaked out of the
office of General Miles. The issue is, why should
such a report have to leak out at all? Why was it
not given out freely?
The President has frankly declared that violators
of the rules of civilized warfare in the Philippines will
be' punished.. It is openly admitted that -our forces
have punished with great and extreme severity Fili
pinos who have been guilty of such acts, but how can
we claim the right to do this if our own troops, in
even a single case, are guilty of the same acts and go
unpunished?
WE hope that the , Government at Washing
ton will not spend too much time trying to
find out how Private A. K. Weir's charges
against Lieutenant Arnold leaked out of the War
Department, for that is a matter in which the coun
try feels but little interest: It is unfortunate that
certain Senators and others, who seem to feel respon
sible for the safety of the administration, have met
too many revelations of irregularity in the Philippines'
by denial and counter accusation, and - their final
proof, as most of them have been proved, by excuses
and palliation/ The enemy that we fight in the Phil
ippines is distant. Events there are but little affected
by what takes place here. There is no perceptible
military reason for concealment of such reports as
Major Gardiner's and v Private Weir's! Their con
cealment or publicity can have no effect on the Phil
ippines, and it is a task of great difficulty to convince
the American people that things done or alleged to
be done under their flag and in their name must be
hidden in the War Department on the enemy's ac
count. The long delay in making public the report
of Major Gardiner had a bad effect on public opinion
and the people do not care whether Weir's report
leaked out of the office of Miles or Corbin, but they
do care to know why they are esteemed unfit to know
all the facts, and the alleged facts, for which they are
made responsible, or for which they are to be ex
cused.

Of course no other American city can point with
scorn at St. Louis or revile the futility of her grand
juries with their reports that bewail but indict not.
The issue is one on which she will have more of sym
pathy than, of mockery. No^other city in the country
may have' fared so badly, but all of them have been
through the mire. If,' then, it be true that St. Louis
has suffered more than others, she has a chance to
ledeem herself by being more resolute and more suc
cessful in cleaning' her skirts and punishing the guilty.
disclosures were made; some went for health, some
for pleasure, some for business, and doubtless some
went for the coronation. It would-be difficult . and
perhaps impossible to gather in all the scattered clan,
but if St. Louis be in: earnest she might catch enough
of them to start" a Penitentiary - Four Hundred- and
teach a better lesson than can ever be taught by
Grand Jury reports. -

We trust that the Mayor will save the prom
ised 10 Der cent for Dermanent Improvements
and also $100,000 additional by eliminating the
unnecessary employes mentioned in the party
platforms. Â¦
Our only hope Is that the Mayor will care
fully scrutinize the amounts appropriated In
the budget and by- his veto privilege curtail
the salary roll of many of the toDheavy and
wasteful departments. We are satisfied that If
the Mayor uses the pruning process he will
easily save $500,000, and by so doing will con
form to his pledge to }he voters and Â¦ taxpay
ers, as exDressed through the Union Labor
party platform and made from the rostrum
prior to the election.
In the desire to please the taxeaters the
Democratic and Union Labor Supervisors for
got their ante-election pledges. The Demo
cratic, Suoervisora throueh their party plat
form subscribed to a pledge to set aDart- 10
per cent of the taxes raised by the city for
permanent "Improvements. The Union Labor
Supervisors through their party platform sub
scribed to a similar pledge, and further, that
they would save $100,000 by eliminating un
necessary municipal -tmaloyes and use the
$100,000 so saved tor Dermanent improvements.
None of the pledged Supervisors made any
effort to keep faith with the voters, and tax
payers. Why are these pledges sof lightly re
carded? Ie it because of the patronage that
the city officials are allowed In certain muni
cipal deuartments? Such are the statements
we read in the press on the day following tho
passing of the budget.
Gentlemen: The budget as passed to print Is
a sore disappointment to the taxpayers. They
had. hoped that their interests and the Inter
ests of the city would receive better considera
tion than has been shown by the Board of Su
pervisors' through the budget. The fact that
nearly $C.UOO.C(JO is allowed for salaries and
maintenance and but $100,000 for improve
ments, and that to come from a possible sur
plus, BhDws plainly, as the press reports stated,
that the appeals of the army of taxeaters were
given the preference. Appeals for increased
salaries from every deuariment were .freely
granted, while scant if any. consideration was
given to the urgent needs of our sewers, streets
and other improvements advocated by improve
ment clubs and individual taxpayers.
At a meeting of the Federation of Mis
sion Improvement Clubs, held last
Wednesday night, the following communi
cation was ordered sent to Mayor Schmitz
and the Board of Supervisors:
Miss Ames was attired, in white chiffon
over peau de soie, with point lace trim
mings, and wore a lace veil. She carried
a shower bouquet of Lilies of the Valley.
Miss Guinette Henley was the maid of
honor. Â¦ She was gowned in pink chiffon
overceau de sole of the- same shade. The
groom was supported by Charles Fernald
of San Francisco. The ribbon-bearers
were Barclay Henley Jr., Roy Pike, Mil
ton Latham and Sidney â¢ Pringle. The
couple left on the afternoon train for' a
wedding to.ur, after which they will re
side in San Francisco, ". .
The wedding breakfast which followed
took place on the lawn in front of the
residence. The lawn had been covered
with green boughs and formed a unique
retreat wherein to serve the feast. Clam
bering rose vines were intertwined with
the greenery, and^ the tables were spread
in a veritable rose bower. The table dec
orations were Duchesse roses.

cided.
Salmond when placed on the stand de
nied the truth of every charge made by
his wife, and his testimony was ably sup
ported by that of the witnesses summon
ed in his behalf.
Mrs. Salmond testified also that she
took care of her husband while he was
suffering from, smallpox, and that during
a period of two years Salmond re
mained idle as a result of his sickness

was corroborated by Fred Burr, her son;
Mrs. H. M. Barr, her mother, and P. O.
Dock, a roomer at the home of the mar
iner and his wife. '
The facts brought out by the examina
tion of the witnesses show the existence
of much hilarity f.t the domicile of the
Salmonds. According to Mrs. Salmond,
her husband has beaten and abused her,
thrown a tea pot at her and disturbed
her peace of mind by hurling his pipe in
her direction. â¢ r

mond was resumed in Judge Hebbard's

iner and his spouse. One set of witnesses
branded Captain Salmond as a fiend in
carnate, and another placed hlm.i on -a
pedestal and made him out a rna/tyr to
woman's Jealousy and petty passions. The
captain's friends told of how well : he
treated his wife, and his wife's friends
told of how he abused her. Strange to re

despite strenuous efforts, to prove untrue

A young man supposed to be A. B. Gilman
of Milton, Cal., fell overboard from the
Stockton steamer Mary Garratt about 9 o'clock
on Wednesday night and was drowned. The
accident occurred when the steamer was pass
ing Disappointment Slough. Gilman. who is
said to have been drinking, was leaning over
the rail. He lost his balance and although
every effort was made to recover the body, no
trace of it was found. From his conversation
when he boarded the steamer It is thought he
was interested in horses.

The loss of mew^iandise by theft from Mis-
Eion-street wharf No. 1 has grown to such
alanr.ing proportions that the shipping con
cerns leasing berths there have combined to
stop the leak. During the past two years the
losses from theft from the various berths on
this dock fceve averaged In the aggregate more
than $400 a month. All ordinary precautions
have proved of no avail. The shipping people
Interested believe the majority of the thefts
have been committed by an organized gang of
pirates who work by night and by day and
take away their spoil generally by boat. A
day watchman has been stationed at the en
trance to the wharf and hereafter only those
en business intent will be allowed to enter the
ched, and at night another watchman armed
*uid elert will keep the preserve clear of
prowlers and closely watch all boats having
communication with the dock. The day watch
man detected a man on Wednesday afternoon
in the act of leaving the dock with & fifty
pound box of tobacco under his arm. The man
was arrested and will be tried to-day.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
TO SAIL.
THE United States revenue cutter
Ferry, which, left here on Tues
day for Seattle, sprung a leak
when about 100 miles north of
this port, and was compelled to
return. She arrived early yesterday
morning: with all hands worn out from
a long spell of bailing, the cutter's pumps
having proved useless.
The Perry started north in the face o*
a Jiead wind, which was accompanied by
more or less of a sea. The strain proved
too much for the revenue boat, and
somewhere in the bones, exactly where
has not yet been located, her seams open
ed to the pressure of the sea. Water
poured in, and when the fact that she
was leaking" was discovered there was
nearly five feet of -water In the forward
hold. The alarm was given, and all
hands turned to and rigged the pumps.
That is all that was done with the
pumps. They refused to work, and as
the newly discovered tide continued 10
rise a bucket brigade was organized. The
vessel continued to buck into head seas,
and the impression made on the water
by the hand-bailing process was hardly
noticeable. Captain Failing then de
cided to return to San Francisco. With
wind and sea astern, the pressure was
taken off the forward seams, and grad
ually the water was bailed out. The leak
inp: continued, however, and the bailing
was kept up until the Perry dropped
off Sausalito. The water destroy
ed a large amount of stores, mostly ra
tions belonging to the crew, and the cut
ter will have to be placed on a drydock
before the location and extent of the
leak can be established. This will be done
to-day, and will probably reveal the ne
cessity for considerable overhauling. The
fixing of the responsibilty for the condi
tion of the pumps will be the work of
a board of inquiry, which will probably
be ordered without delay. The fact that
the cutter was allowed to start on a long
cruise with the pumps in unserviceable
condition suggests carelessness which
will entitle somebody to a warm session
on the grill of the Treasury Department.

R. Stedman, the Enquirer employe who
made the affidavit that the books had
never been delivered. Stedman was not
to be found around town to-day and G
B. Daniels of the Enquirer said that he
had not seen him. â¢ . - Â¦
"Stedman has not been at /jur office
since the publication of his affidavit "
said G. B. Daniels of the Enquirer. "I
know nothing about him at all and I don't
care to."
Mr. Daniels was a very busy man to
day. He had lots of consultations with his
attorneys and his friends, but his paper
made only a very brief reference to the
drawing of the Grand Jury and contained
no further statements as to his position.
All he had to say was:
I am glad that the Grand Jury has been
called. It disposes of everything and gives me
a full opportunity to go before that body and
show it how I am being attacked by the water
company and its hired attorneys because I re
fused to do their bidding. I can explain all
and am ready to do -so to the Grand Jury
the minute it gets in session.
This leads up to the Enquirer and the
schism that exists therein. Russel R
Stedman, the confidential business man of
the institution, appears charging the pro
prietors with felony. The business man
ager of the institution, M.-de L. Hadley
while he refuses to say anything about
this particular matter, is now being
charged by the managers with being privy
to the prosecution and troubles that have
arisen In the last few months.

Dalton and Daniels can attack me all they
please, but those are the facts as we find them.
They can Bay Â¦what they please about me and,
shout the water company, and political enmity,
but that doesn't produce any of these books or
that missing bill. They can say that they are
the Bimon pure reformer* in thii town, . and
But here comes thÂ« order given Oakes for
thirty mortgage books in 1901. These books
would be dated 1902 to 1905. But there are. no
such books, and Dalton and Daniels don't dare
attempt substitution of old etock because of
the dates. It won't do for them to show up
with a set of books dated from 1901 to 1901
and another set dated from 1902 to 1905. be
cause that would be- too raw. They are right
up against it on the question of the mortgage
books. That bill was for $600. and that alone
would be a felony. ;
Mortgage books contain four columns on each
page, and at the top of each column is printed
a year, thus each set of books is made to do
duty for four years. The present set of mort
gage books begins with the year 1001 and ends
with the year 1904. They must, â¢ therefore,
have been made In the year 1900. Upon ex
amining the records of the county - we find a
bill dated August 30, 19O0, for sixteen mort
gage books, for which the Enquirer received
$312. That is clearly the order of sixteen
books now being used. .
Give them all they claim, for the sake of
argument. Let us admit that the fifty-eight
books found in the vault were part of the
order of seventy-five, though I don't believe
it. Where are the thirty mortgage books?
Not one of those books can be found, . and
why? Owing to the peculiar printing of these
books there can be no substitution, while there
might be of the others. Mr Dalton and Mr.
Daniels do not dare to substitute mortgage
books, and I am willing to stand on that item
alone.
Neither Mr. Dalton nor Mr. Daniels can
show that those books were ever made or
delivered, and on the other hand the money
for those books has been drawn out of the
county treasury.
I Ftand Just where I did yesterday. I am
ready to produce a responsible person who will
swear to a warrant for felony against both
Dalton and Daniels. I was ready to do so this
morning when the Grand Jury was called, and
now I bow to the conditions that exist. My
clients and myself are ready to go before the
Grand Jury and tell what we know.
Emil Nusbaumer spent most of his time
about the Courthouse to-day. His life
is becoming very strenuous since he began
hunting the Dalton animal and the at
torney for Mr. Bromley was compelled to
take a nap during the afternoon, when
no one was allowed to disturb him. At
the conclusion of the nap Mr. Nusbaumer
went out to see whether the missing bill
for $685 35 had been found. Then he went
home to await the calling of the Grand
Jury on Monday next. He said:
NUSBAUMEE POSITIVE.
That Is erne of those statements of Nus
baumer. I wonder if he is going to tell me and
the people what is necessary for this office?
He Isn't Assessor of this county and I am. I
gave those orders, both of them, and I wouldn't
have given them if they had not been necessary
for the office. Is Nusbaumer going to tell
people and me what is necessary for this of
fice? I nave never given an order for any
stuff that was not necessary for my office,
and Mr. Nusbaumer can't come around now and
tell me what I ought to use and how much.
That stuff was needed In my office and I or
dered it. I don't care what the date was.
on me. and try to put me Into a. hole, then a
man has to be very careful. There are people
whom I have done great favors for. and they
are trying to do me up. Oakes ought to be my
friend and Stedman has been drawing a salary
from my friends. I have had my boys in th6
office out looking: thines up and trying to see
where we all stand. I don't know anything
r.ew and have not found any, more books. I
can only say what I said yesterday, that this
Is a dirty political job to try to ruin me.
Mr. Dalton was asked to explain why on
August 19 an order was given for 105
books and then on October 3 an order was
given for fifty-nine books, and why the
fifty-nine books could be found and the
105 were nearly all missing. Mr. Dalton
grew very angry and replied :

Dr. Witherbee is reported to have said
that no acts. of immorality can be charged
against any of the girls or men employed
at the . hospital. Several have been j dis
charged on ; account : of indiscretion, such
as remaining ; out until late hours of the
night and late suppers, that were attended
by female hospital employes. The Super
visors may investigate the affair.
Miss Â¦ Dorothy Fen wick is said to have
been the only dignified nurse among the
seniors in the hospital. Because she re
fused to take part in certain hazing ex
peditions against the younger girls, she
was marked as a special subject for haz
ing herself last March and April by her
classmates. Several times before that she
was attacked in her own room, and on one
occasion had to defend i herself with a
hammer, it is alleged. The night of April
I she was compelled to flee in her night
clothes to the house of a neighbor, having
been driven from the hospital by the tor
ments heaped upon her by the other stu
dents of the senior "class. "
Â¦ It appears from reports of Superintend
ent Witherbee that a bad state of affairs
has existed for several weeks. Ever since
Dr. Witherbee, the . -new, superintendent,
took his. place at. the head: of the institu
tion, ' a spirit of mutiny has existed among
the seniors. ',-Â¦Â¦
Miss Uintah Carter, formerly matron of
the' hospital, is alleged' to.be responsible
for the inception of all the trouble. She
took a dislike to Dr. Witherbee, says that
gentleman, and before , her resignation,
April 1, succeeded in turning most of the
nurses against him. The trouble was ag
gravated by a fierce class feeling between
seniors and Juniors, engendered, It is al
leged, by Miss Carter's espousal of -the
cause of offending seniors. , Â¦ â. â¢

NERVOUS and refractory horses
are congratulating themselves on
the Invention of a citizen of Sac
ramento that enables equines to
have their hoofs shod with but
little trouble.
At the horseshoeing shop of Healy &
Powers, 817 Folsom street, an exhibition
was given yesterday of the method by
which horses can have their iron shoes
put 6n' in almost the same easy manner
as the human race dons its leather ones.
Instead of sitting in a chair, however,
and having a sleek clerk take the pedal
extremity . in â¢ hand and force a i "four"
shoe on a "six" foot,. the horse gets bet
ter treatment. It is led up to an appara
tus that looks like a skeleton box stall.
The sides of the machine are closed
around the animal and at a signal he is
hoisted off the floor- by means of a winch
that lifts the "entire apparatus.
The feet of the equine are drawn taut,
forward and behind, and fastened to cros
bars and four men can work on the shoe
ing expeditiously and with ease. The
most vicious horse can be placed in the
machine in less than two minutes and can
neither injure itself nor the men who are
fitting its "Trilbys."
When the body was being carried from
the church at the conclusion of the ser
vices Miss Annie I. Roney sang "Neare \
My God, to Thee," and not a few of the
several hundred people -who had gath
ered to pay the last sad tribute to the
dead were moved to tears. Interment
took place in Holy Cross Cemetery. .
Richard S. Doyle, the well-known pi
oneer builder and contractor who died

The funeral sermon was preached by
the Rev. Father Yorke, who spoke on
death. In closing he paid an eloquent
tribute to the memory of the' deceased.

When people like Oakef and Stedmaa go back
"Client" Bromley and his two attorneys
take the stand that the lost bill represents
the books that were found, leaving the
Oakes-Enquirer order of seventy-five
working assessment rolls and thirty
mortgage books still unaccounted for.
County Assessor Dalton denies this, and
says that the bill of 1899 covers books
that have long ago been used. But the
County Assessor does not say anything
about the delivery of the disputed books
at his office. He says that he is trying to
find out "where he is at," and that
somebody has betrayed him. This is
what Mr. Dalton had to say to-day:
DALTON'S STATEMENT.
In the course of these Investigations Mr.
Bromley and his attorneys found this
bill of $C55 25 for working assessment rolls
dated August 30, 1899. The investigators
suspected that this bill might cover the
books that were found in the vault,. and
they started to look up the bill which
Â¦tfould contain items and specifications
that would enable them to identify the
books. But when they came to search for
the bill jt was missing: All the other
bills for the month of August, 1899, were
found, but this particular bill was miss-
Ing- and up to the closing of the Auditor's
office it had not been found.
This discovery was made when "Client"
Ross P. Bromley went through the bills
of the Auditor's office. Mr. Bromley and
his attorneys were anxious to find if there
was any bill on file in the Auditor's office
that could possibly account for the fifty
eight books that were found in the vault
In Mr. Dal ton's cellar yesterday. They
found fifty-nine books In the racks of
Mr. Dalton's office and found a bill in the
Auditor's ofiice that positively Identified
these books as having been paid for. It
was their desire to find another bill that
Â¦would identify the fifty-eight books that
were resurrected from the vault below
stairs.
The next most important development
of the day was the fact that a bill In
favor of the Enquirer Publishing Com
pany for $Gs5 35 dated August 30, 1899, was
missing, and up to the closing of the
Auditor's office it had not been discov
ered.
Next to the Grand Jury incident tho
most important fact of the day is the
failure to locate any more books. County
Assessor Henry P. Dalton and all of his
deputies have not been able to unearth
any more than the fifty-eight books that
were found in the vault yesterday, and
at the close of business at the Court
house to-day there was still a shortage of
thirty mortgage books and seventeen
working assessment books, or forty-seven
In all.
This disposes of all matters until next
â¢week. Nothing more in a legal way can
be done this week, and it will be next
Monday before the Grand Jury Is finally
drawn, and it will take several days after
that before they get down to work.
Then there will be the examining of wit
nesses, and if any conclusion is reached
inside of two or three weeks it will be
very fast work.
DHAWING OF GRAND JURY.
By this move ail embassassing questions
were passed up to the nineteen citizens
who will be selected on Monday next, and
r.o county officials will be called upon to
pass judgment upon the acts of any other
Itllow county officials. It relieved the
District Attorney's office of a great deal
cf trouble, for otherwise District Attor
ney Alien would have been compelled to
rass upon the question of whether a war
rant snould be issued for Henry P. Dal
Â».on and G. B. Daniels. There were sev
eral consultations between the District
Attorney and Emil Nusbaumer and Henr3 r
P. Dalton and Vvilliam Lair Hill, the at
torney for Mr. Dalton, and others. The
result was that shortly before noontime
District Attorney Allen passed the whole
mailer up to the Superior Judges, with a
request mat they decide whether a Grand
Jury should be drawn or not. There was
a coni-uitation of the Judges, who deefded
that the matter would better be looked
into, and shortly afterward Judge Melvin
drew the thirty names given and the own
ers were ordered to report on Monday be
fore h:m.

Court of Alameda County, with a
request that they draw a special Grand
Jury to consider the matter. The result
was that the Superior Judges decided
that there was enough to warrant the
drawing of a special Grand Jury, and
Judge H. A. Melvin of the criminal de
partment drew thirty names, the owners
of which axe ordered to report to him on
Monday next and show cause why they
should not servo upon a special Grand
Jury to examine into the question of
whether the books ordered by County
Assessor Henry P. Dalton were e%'er
made by either George A. Oakes of Hay

Sharp is a devout Mormon. The court
room was packed to suffocation when the
aged ' witness was on the stand, and as
Sharp testified to hl3 belief in God's rev
elation of the guilt of the accused tears
ran- down the faces of scores of those
present. . ....
â¢< Under sharp cross-questioning by the
attorneys for the defense,. Sharp stated
that he had received revelations from
God before, relating to the gospel of Je
sus Christ. He said he had not told the
officers of his first revelation because it
was not necessary. He knew Hay's body
would be found.
â¢ This Is not the only manifestation I received.
On Tuesday noon I saw the trail of blood lead
ing from the railroad tracks to where my son
in-law was burled. I saw it in a vision just
as plainly, as when I afterward visited the
spot. i
I charged Peter Mortensen, with the murder
of my son-in-law because I knew he was
guilty. God revealed it to me. He appeared
to me by the Holy Ghost and put the words
of the Spirit into my mouth. I had to utter
them, for I knew they Â» were true. I cannot
and will not deny It here, neither will I deny
it'when I meet mv God on the laat day.

fied that God had revealed the guilt of
Mortensen to him. Testifying to his talk

The members of the "Fiddle Dee Dec"
company worked overtime yesterday af
ternoon in order to aid the Theatrical Em
ployes' Club of San Francisco. " This ex
tra matinee was due to the goodness. of
heart of Manager Fischer and the clever
people behind the' footlights. Every dol
lar was turned over to the club.
_There was a very good attendance.
The efforts of Barney Bernard, Messrs.
Kolb and Dill, Maud Amber, Freda Gal
lick and other clever.people in the organ
ization were highly appreciated. The
laughter was increased by the timely
jokes' sprung for the occasion by the come
dians. The success of the benefit was
due to the efforts of the following com
mittees: .
Delmas was the batting king of the day.
He rapped out two doubles and a single
out of three times up. Wagner collided
with Hogan in trying to squeeze one of
Del's doubles in left and was put out for
a. lew minutes. He soon recovered and
played the game out. Both pitchers had
many chances and took them all grace
lully. Outfielder Lawler has been released
by Manager Harris. The score:

The fun went merrily on without a
point until the tenth round, when the
winning tally was brought in by Holly.
He opened the tenth with a hot drive
over second and advanced on Reilly's
bunt, beating the throw to second. Del
xnas sacrificed and Kagan thought he saw
a chance to catch the runner napping at
third. He threw over Sheehan's head and
Holly scooted over the rubber with the
telling run.
The game can easily be classed as a
pitcher s battle. Both Whalen and Doyle
unwound a variety of curves and shoots
and mixed up twisters that were enough
to make their managers feel like raising
their salaries. Honors were just about
even up, but Whaien's support was better
and therefore he managed to win out-
It was a beautiful, snappy little game,
cud the Thursday crowd which took a
chance to look at it was glad to be on the
tpGi. Eagan's fatal xniscue was the only
die which had a bearing on the result,
though both teams managed to squirm
out of a few piaces which looked tight.
There were numerous pretty bits of field
ing scattered along the line of battle,
and "all the hits were those clean kind
â¢wiuch have a cheery sound when they
leave the bat.
The Senators fought just a trifle harder
yesterday afternoon Just because it was
the thirteenth game they were about to
lose. They finally lost it, or rather Truck
tagan lost It for them. As Truck is a
voting citizen of Sacramento, it was a
victory for the Ponies over the Senatorial
team end not over Truck, as many were
ltd to believe. The score was 1 to 0, and
an extra round had to be attached before
Jim McDonald had a chance to say who
should be the goods.

â¢The following programme was render
ed in addition to the addresses:
Director "Woodward, before present
ing the diplomas, said he had been told
that all he had to do was to hand over
the diplomas and say nothing; now he
found he was down for "Advice to Grad
uates," which he didn't think was quite
fair, as he was a poor speaker. He man
aged, however, to keep the graduates and
audience in roars of laughter by his wit
and in conclusion bade the members of
the class to be true to themselves and by
their lives of honesty give to the world
a great example. He then presented the
diplomas.
The following are the graduates of June,
1902:
Director â¢ Mark told of the growth of
the Mission High School from a little twig
in 1S96 to the lull-grown tree of 1902, and
said it was the only school that had been
named after the district where it was lo
cated, t
The graduates sat In rows on the stage,
literally surrounded with beautiful flow
ers. The stage lights were hidden by bou
quets of roees and carnations, and fully
fifty handsome baskets, filled with frag
rant blossoms, tributes to the young grad
uates, lined the front of the orchestra.
President Denman made the opening re
marks. He spoke feelingly of the young
pupils who had now finished their twelve
years' study in the city schools.
Joseph O'Connor, /principal of the Mis
sion High, read an address, "The Pupil,
the Parent and the Teacher." He spoke
of general education in the schools in San
Francisco and said the only way the pupil
could have ultimate success was by hav
ing the parent and the teacher in touch
Â¦with him or her.
Director Roncovieri said the Mayor
had begged him to present the latter' a
regrets Â£or not being able to be present,
but he had been called away on ofllci&l
business. The Mayor had asked him to
state that he was very sorry he could
not have the pleasure of Â¦ meeting the
graduates and also his old teacher, now
principal of the Mission High School, Mr.
O'Connor. Mr. Roncovieri then direct
ed a few words of advice to the gradu
ates.
THE large auditorium of the Mis
sion High School on the corner of
Eighteenth and Dolores streets

friends and relatives who had

718 Market StreetNew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 5. â There was more busi
ness in stocks to-day than on any day of the
week. The increased activity was a result
of adflltional pressure to sell. The disposition
to cell was not confined to any one portion
of the list and was quite evenly distributed
amt>r.g the usually prominent stocks. The sell
ing was not urgent, but was persistent and
caine-d in volume toward the latter part of
the day. 1'robably the meet effective single
lactor in the weaknews of the market wu a
general feeling of anxiety over the develop
ments in the labor world. The high tension
to which feeling hits been raised In the anth
racite region, as t-hown by the boycott meas
ures and public demonstrations by friends of
the strikers caused uneasiness, which was in
tensified by the example of the violence In
the Chicago teamsters' strike. In the ranks
ot the operators and the financial powers in
the commercial industry there was some feel
ing mac'fei'ted over the step taken by the
New York Board of Trade and Transportation
in sending a . petition to the President to in
tervÂ«ie and take measures to effect a settle
ment of the questions in diepute. ThÂ« report
from Washington that the Buggestion was un
der consideration by the chief executive did
not tend to reassure holders of the stocks of
cool-carrying roads and they sought J.o lighten
their holdings. Reports that strlkens in the
va!lÂ»-y Iron foundries were prepared to resume
work was pointed to In thla connection and
had rather a depressing influence than other
wise. The lake freight handlers' strike and
the deal to curtail ore deliveries also received
new consideration. The reports of continued
'heavy orders for all grades of Iron products
for delivery far Into the future did not avail
to relieve the heaviness of the United States

CHICAGO. June 5. â As a result of the ex
cessive rains in- the Southwest over a large
portion of the j Winter wheat country commis
sion houses had good buying orders at the
opening. There was still- out good short inter
est and both the leading elevator interest ani
the corn bull crowd supported the pit. ? These
influences ' were too much for the unresponsive
cables, Export business- was poor and shipping
houses ;Â¦ did nothing. With shorts covering
freely at the start. July made opening sales
at a shade lower to %@%c higher at.71%@
72%c, and- after some wavering touched 72%c.
The wet. .weather was working .against Im
provement In the spring,, country, but despite
this Influence and the good â¢ show of corn
strength; the early buyers were 'satisfied with
small profits.,' There seemed to be 'no faith
on the bull side after the early bulge and gen
eral liquidation brought a sharp slump for
July down to 71%@71%c. The outside inter
ests are very small In the market at the pres
ent and. traders feel that this Is partly the
reason for the liquidation of the buying crowd
There was a partial recovery toward the end
of the session, but July closed weak. %c down
at 71%@71%c. .
Traders in corn were inclined to a bearish
view of the market, but prices, acted against
them. Considerable strength was shown most
of the session, although much of the advance
was lost when wheat broke. July closed firm
%c up at 62% Â©62 Vic.
Activity marked the traders In oats. July
new standard ,waÂ» especially in demand. The
close was strong, %o up.
. Provisions ruled -weak. There was a mark
ed change In front by the packers, who have
been buying of late, and when they appeared
as sellers prices broke. An easy hog market
also was a bearish Incentive. July pork closed

London Market.
Steel stock* and other iron and steel stocks.
The selling of the grangers seemed to be duo,
to some extent, to reports of too abundant
rains in the Southwest and also to the falling
back in the figures of receipts of corn. The
late reaction in Jhe grain markets, after early
strength, did not change the weak tone of
the grangers. Chicago and Northwestern was
marked up 2 points on the announcement of
the long-heralded extra dividend on the stock,
but half of the gain was lost. Hocking Val
ley reflected disappointment over the declara
tion of only the former dividend rate. The
large profit-making in Canadian Pacific at a
total reaction of 4 points had a sympathetic
effect on the whole list. Amalgamated Cop.
per was depressed by the weakness of the mar
ket for raw copper and was not affected by
a trade circular pointing out great improve
ment in the trade. The continued rise in sterl
ing exchange gave rise to some apprehension
that exchange had started toward the gold
export point on account of the easier tone of
the money market. The approach of the crop
moving period is constantly . narrowing the
time before the interior demands for currency
will begin to deplete the supply of funds
available for speculative use. The combined
effect of various items of depression was 'a
dribble of realizing all day. which carried
prices downward until the close, which was
easy, at the lowest.
Active liquidation of the Central of Georgia
income bonds had a depressing effect upon
the bond market. Total sales $270,700.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

â¢SALMONâ The demand continues good and
the market rules firm. Alaskan packers are
obliged to turn down orders and say that a
supply of 2. r >0,000 cases could be readily dis
posed of. Large sales of Columbia River for
future delivery at $1 35 have been made, most
of the pack has been placed and a further ad
vance is expected. The English markets are
also firm and slightly higher, with an improv
ing inquiry.
TEAâ Japans are very firm, the primary
market being fully 2% per cent higher than at
the corresponding time a year ago largely as
the result of the heavy frost damage to the
first crop. The Formosa market opened 10 per

active Â¦ â¢

Oakland Office San Franci3co Call,
1118 Broadway, June 5.
Bigamy is now charged against Michael
T. Ward, who dazzled Oakland shopkeep
ers with his story of a fortune of $000,000
that awaited him In Great Britain. Ward
is serving a six months' sentence for
stealing a diamond ring from Jeweler S.
Lathrop. The police are busy, mean
while, uncovering the swindler's past,
and it is a bad one.
From Salt Lake City to-day comes a
record of Ward's career there that
shows, according to the Mormon city's
police, that the reputed railroad contrac
tor and English heir has grievously de
ceived the woman whom he married a
few months ago at Seattle, because ha
had a wife on his hands at Salt LakÂ»
City when the northwestern marriage
was solemnized.
Not only that, but the blood of another
unfortunate woman with whom Ward be
came entangled is on his hands, for she
committed suicide.
It is from Samuel Paul, Chief of Polica
of Salt Lake City, that Chief of Police
Hodgkins "to-day received the following
letter: m
Dear Sir: The man Ward that you inquired
about In your last letter of May 31 was ar
rested here for obtaining goods by false pre
tenses, having bought wine, etc., for the wed
ding at the time he married Mrs. Fox. Ha
Induced her to marry him by promising to
give her enough money to make her independ
ent. He claimed to have large railroad con
tracts, which would make him rich, and he
had maps to carry out his story. Mrs. Fox
is his legal wife, having been married to him
in the Catholic church. The woman you men
tioned as bis wife was his stenographer, who
lived with him. He was not married to her.
She committed suicide after he married Mrs.
Fox. When he got In Jail he wanted Mrs.
Fox to put up to get him out, but she re
fused, telling him ' that If he was so well
fixed he could get the money some other place.
Mrs. Fox would like you to give any informa
tion you can to help her so that she can get
a divorce.

Supervisors' Fire Committee Refers
Petition of Spring Valley Com
pany to Park Commission.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee yester
day heard the petition of the Spring Val
ley Water Company for permission to
erect a water tower on Lafayette Square
to clve a better water supply to Presidio
and Pacific Heights. Chief Engineer
Sehussler said that the company is will
ing to construct an ornamental steel
tower in place of the old wooden tank
now located on the square, provided the
permit be granted for a reasonable period.
Park Commissioners Sullivan and Mc-
Donald held that the Park Commission
alone had jurisdiction in the matter and
opposed building anything on park prop
erty. McDonald said a site could be ob
tained one block away, but Sehussler
said there was no other available place as
high as Lafayette Square. He offered to
build the tower for the Park Commission
and give water to the park. Sullivan ac
cepted this proposition, saying the com
mission would maintain the tower as a
public monument. H. J. Crocker said the
district needed more water and Fire Com
missioner Hecht said It would certainly
have a better pressure. S. W. Holliday
Erotested against the present tank and
eld that the water company should fur
nish its own. site. The matter was then
referred to the Park Commission for ac
tion.

overcoat and the ladies sat down with
force enough to rattle their back teeth.
GAINES TO THE RESCUE.
Mrs. Walters and her companion did not
yell^out, "There's a man in the room,"
but they did attempt to lock the door in
the hope of capturing the intruder. Both
Jumped out of bed and grappled with
the burglar. He struggled and- they
screamed. The more he struggled the
louder the ladies yelled, until the peace
ful hotel resounded with their cries.
Mrs. Walters could not see any one in
the darkness, but she had a presentiment
that there was a man in the room. She
nudged Miss Mae Clark, who was sleep
ing at her side, and whispered her sus
picions to her. Both sat up in bed and
peered through the darkness. The bur
glar could not hold his breath for fear
of being asphyxiated. He gasped for air
and was discovered.
The door of Mrs. Walters' apartment
opened and the burglar * cautiously en
tered. He heard the occupants breathing
and made no noise. The burglar had not
been in the room two minutes when he
discovered that it was a room occupied
by lad'es. i
While moving round the room, picking
up souvenirs of his visit, his foot, caught
in a "ping pong" net and he tripped up.
The noise awakened the sleepers. The
burglar stopped breathing.
BTJRGLAR ENTERS.
it was 3 o'clock last Saturday morning.
The rain beat down incessantly, and a.l
but milkmen tind policemen were indoors.
Quiet reigned in the Klite Hotel at 441
Geary street.
A lone man bundled in a light overcoat
Fiiuseci before the house. He glanced at
the abode and saw the door mvitlngiy
open. He wore rubber shoes to keep nis
feet dry. Noiselessly he climbed the car
peted stairs' and walked along the hall
way. With deft hand he tried the knobs
and at last success crowned his efforts.

SERVES MTJNICIP/'
FOR THIRTY YEARS
The first decided break in the ranks of
the suspended carpenters' unions for re
instatement in the brotherhood wa3 taken
last night by twenty members of union
423, when they signed a call for a meeting
to be held to-morrow evening for the pur
pose of making formal application to the
brotherhood for reinstatement.
This was one of the unions which held
cut against union 4S3 in its tight against
the Building Trades Council, and for cer
tain acts it was suspended by the united
brotherhood. Since that time many of
the men have lost considerable time in
the boycott against the brotherhood
anions and great dissatisfaction thereat
was expressed. In view of recent devel
opments the union members
that their best Interests would be sub
served by remaining with the brother
hood and the action stated was deter
mined upon. It is likely that the union
will be granted a new charter by the
brotherhood.
The Bulldinz Trades Council met last
night in B'nai B'rith Hall with an unu
sually large attendance. The carpenters'
troubles were discussed at length and the
reports received tended to show that the
attitude of the council towards the
brotherhood unions was indorsed by the
master builders as well as the mill men.
Affiliated unions reported their willing
ness to stand by the council in Its fight
to the bitter end, the proposition being
ihat the working card of the council
alone should be recognized by union men
and employers of union mechanics. Dur
ing the peace -which will prevail till the
end of the month both, sides to the con
troversy are doing considerable prose
lytizing and the result will be watched
by all Interested with deep concern.
Captain A. H. Payson, vice president of
the Santa Fe Railway Company, appeared
yesterday before the Supervisors' Street
Committee and stated that he was not
prepared to say what action would be
taken regarding the proposition of the
board that the company defray the entire
cost of building a drawbridge across
Channel street at the foot of Third.
Chairman Curtis of the committee stated
that the board believed, in view of the
fact that the corporation had. been grant
ed immense privileges in the Potrero dis
trict relative to grade changes and rights
of way, it should pay lor the bridge.
Captain Payson said the bridge would
cost $70,000, and, while he was impressed
with the arguments, he would have to
consult with the directors of the com
pany before giving an answer. Payson
said he would appear next Monday before
the board and state would the company
would do in the premises.
The committee reported against the
petition of H. K. Hedges f6r permission
to construct overhead wires for telephone
and messenger service.
Joseph Scheerer was granted an exten
sion of ninety days to remove obstruc
tions from Channel street.
Sullivan Bros, were granted permission
io blast on a lot on the north side of
Ellis street, between Hyde and Leaven
worth streets. Zl ',' m
The -petitions of the Southern Pacific
Company for a franchise to operate a
"cut-off" line from Sunnyside avenue to
Sixth street went over pending the report
of the City Engineer on the proposed
grade changes, route and method of
proper construction of the road.
The applications of the United Railways
and the California and Union street lines
for street railway franchises were post
poned one week.
Dennis Kearney sent a communication
to the Board of Supervisors yesterday re
questing that body to invite the directors
of the United Railways to explain an al
leged juggling of the figures on the capi
talization of the stock of the corporation.
Kearney says the bonded indebtedness
proposed by the company and to be acted
upon by the stockholders will be $3o,2.Â»,000
in 4 per cent twenty-five-year gold bonds.
There is to be reserved for liens $14,9ol.00O,
less $4,725,000, to be discharged by opera
tion of sinking funds under existing mort
gage of J9.S66.C00; re.served for better
ments, $5,409,000: outstanding $20,000,000.

District Attorney Byington is inclined
to the belief__that Conway is at sea. The
fact that on. Tuesday at noon he was
informed that Conway would not appear
in court at 2 o'clock Is regarded by him
as proof that some one had knowledge
of Conway's movements and plans. The
statement that Conway was seen at
midnight on Monday is now believed by
the dftectives to have been' made by a
friends of Conway for the purpose of
throwing the officers off- his track. Nev
ertheless the police have wired Portland,
Reno and Ix>s Angeles to keep a lookout
for the missing clerk, and if he appears
at any of the points named his arrest is
almost sure to follow.
Chief of Detectives Martin said yester
day that he had searched the city dili
gently for some trace of Conway, but
without success. He is now convinced
that Conway is at sea. His suspicion
was verified by a statement made to him
to the effect that Conway was seen in the
vicinity of the transport dock on Mon
day morning, and that the opinion pre
vailed on the front that Conway waa
smuggled aboard the transport Buford
before she went into the stream. Con
way was a politician, with many friends
on the front, who would go to any
lengths to get him out of difficulty; so
that it is not improbable that he was as
sisted to a berth in the Buford or some
other vessel sailing for a foreign port.
MAY BE AT SEA.
It will be two weeks before the work
of the expert on Conway's books will be
completed, so that it is Impossible at
this time to state even approximately
the amuont of his defalcation. The fact
that he appropriated fines to his^ own
use was not discovered until yesterday,
so that his field of operations was greatly
enlarged. That "the city will be a suf
ferer to a large amount is generally be
lieved.
The Grand Jury will take the matter
in hand at its meeting to-day, and his
Indictment on charges of forgery and em
bezzlement is a certainly. District At
torney .Byington has completed his work
in the matter of presenting evidence
against Conway, and there is enough to
convict him a dozen times over. His for
gery of the name of M. Walker to an
order for J15 bail in the case of LÂ». T.
Walkman is one of the strongest weap
ons held against him by the prosecution:
Three other cases, all of which prove
Conway's guilt, will be brought to the
attention of the Grand Jury,- and his in
dictment is confidently expected. This
will bring the machinery of the law in
play against him. and all subsequent evi
dence of wrong doing on his part will be
merely cumulative.
GRAND JURY INTERESTED.
The detectives engaged in the search
for Frederick B. Conway, the default
ing clerk of Police Judge Mogan's court,,
received information yesterday which
seems to indicate that Conway was one of
the passengers on board the' United
States transport Buford when she sailed
for Manila at noon on Monday. Coupled
with this news Is the. additional discov
ery that Conway{s peculations were not
confined to his embezzlement of bail
money, but to fines as well.
Inquiry yesterday developed that Con
way stole $100 a few days before his ex
posure, that sum being the amount | of
a fine imposed upon a Chinese for sell
ing opium without a physician's i pre
scription. The money was paid in open
court, and Conway took charge of the
coin. Conway's record showed that the
case was dismissed, while the record
kept by Judge Mogan proves that the fine
was imposed.
It is now believed that the Investiga
tion now being made will develop similar
cases. Expert Elliott is busily engaged
in the- task, but he declines to say how
successful his efforts have been. It is
certain, however, that Conway's records
will show beyond question that only a
small part of his crookedness has been
exposed, and that other fines which
should have been paid into the city treas
ury were disposed of by Conway at the
racetrack or in the gratification of the
numberless pleasures for which he had a
weakness.
