In view of the fact that Congress and
not the executive is empowered to deter
mine whether an officer of the Govern
ment shall receive a decoration from a for
eign Government, the decision of the
President will undoubtedly cause a stir
In the Capitol. Both the admiral and the
general have many friends in the Senate
end the House who will be inclined to
take up the matter and press It if allowed
to do so.
"There was absolutely no justification
for the President's decision." said a friend
of General Miles. "Mr. Roosevelt has at
tempted to Inflict national disgrace upon
the commanding general of the army and
the admiral of the navy, and now' he has
sought to make their humiliation Inter
national. Of course it will be Impossible
for General Miles to take any action, but
his friends will now understand the
lengths to which the President is willing
to go In his hostility toward him."
Admiral Dewey is inspecting the North
Atlantic squadron on - the southern drill
grounds. General Miles refused to be
seen this afternoon In regard to the pro
posal of the French Government and its
rejection by the President. It is stated,
however, that neither officer win make a
protest. Nor is it seen how this could be
done, in view of the fact that the French
Government never directly tendered the
decoration to them.
FURTHER HUMILIATION.
A notification that the cross would be
conferred upon Admiral Dewey and Lieu
tenant General Miles was taken to the
White House by M. Cambon, the French
Embassador. France desired to commem
orate the ceremonies connected with the
unveiling of the Rochambeau statue to
occur here on May 24. and she believed it
would be a graceful act of courtesy to
select prominent Americans for member
ship of her Legion of Honor. M. Cam
bon called at the White House two weeks
ago and stated that his Government, in
consideration of the great services ren
dered to the world by Admiral Dewey
and General Miles, desired to confer the
cro^F upon them.
WOULD CONFER CROSS.
This action has caused a sensation in
diplomatic and r.nny and navy circles..
The officers directly concerned and their
friends assert that the President's de
cision was due tD a wish to further hu
miliate and this time to make the humil
iation international. Whatever may have
been the reasons controlling 1 the action of
the President, it is certain that France
will not. In view of his attitude, award
the cross to either of the officers.

â¢A final question: Doe not coeducation lead
to marriaKe? 'Most certainly It does, and
this fact cannot be and need not be denied.
The wonder 4s rather .that there, are not more
of such marriare?.. It is a constant surprise
that. so many colleee men turn from their-col
lege associates '. and marry some earlier or
later acquaintance of inferior 'ability. " In
ferior traininz and often inferior; personal
charm- The marriages which result from col
lege association are not usually premature,
and It is certainly true that no better mar
riages can be made than those founded on
common interests and Intellectual friendship.
A college man who has known collese wo
men as a rule Is not drawn to those of lower
.ideals and inferior training. His choice U
likely to be led toward 'the best he has known.
A college woman Is not led by mere propin
quity to accept the attentions of inferior men.
. In I like manner the association with wise,
sane r.nj healthy women has its value for
young men. This value has never been fully
realized, even by the strongest advocates of co
education. It raises their Ideal of womanhood
and the highest manhood must be associated
with such an ideal.
. In schools for men alone the reverse condi
tion often' obtains. The sense of reality ob
scures Jhe elements of beauty and fitness.' It
is of srreat advantage to both men and women
to meet on a plane of equality in education.
Women are brought into contact with men
who can do thlnsrs â men in whom the sense
of reality Is strong and who Â¦ have definite
view3 of life. This influence affects them for
good. â¢
In women'% education as planned for women
alone the . tendency is toward the study of
beauty and order. Literature and language
take precedence over science. The educated
woman is likely to master technique rather
than art; method rather than substance. She
may know a good deal, but she can do noth
ing. .
In this direction. I think, lies the strongest
argument fcr coeducation. This argument Is
especially cocent !n institutions in which the
Individuality of the student Is .recognized and
respected. In such schools each man by his
relation to action and realities becomes a
teacher of, women in these regards, as In other
Ways each cultivated woman is a teacher of
men. . ' .' " > â¢ . .

the power to say to the Cuban people,
"We won't buy your sugar unless you
put it at a certain figure," but Have
meyer contended that this was not so.
He was then excused from giving further
testimony unless the' committee should
decide to summon him again. The com
mittee adjourned until to-morrow.

Now, however, the Canadian compan- j
ies and the Government are both seeking '
the centralizing of Canadian shipping In ;
Canadian channels. It is proposed to can- i
eel the old order, 6O that none but Can- '
adian. boats may carry goods which have Â¦
been bonded thr(?Â»gh American territory !
from Vancouver to Skagway. The activ- j
ity of American competitors in the- busi- i
ness on this side of the line has caused
this action to be urged upon the Govern- ;
ment and the old order probably will be I
rescinded. Â¦ Â¦ ' ' ' , \
Recently large shipments of cattle, of!
which the entire supply for the Klondike j
leaves Vancouver, have been shipped j
from here, all on boats of American reg- i
ister.
The proposed action would mean ulti
mately the cutting off of Vancouver from 'Â¦
the Skagway route of such American ves- !
sels as the City of Seattle, the Dolphin .
and the Humboldt, and, perhaps, a.' rate '
war 'between the companies and the Can- j
adian Pacific. None of the companies in- '
terested are anxious for a rate dispute j
and the interference of the Government is
taken as a proposal to eject the Amer- I
lean companies without showing the hand j
of business rivalry.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 5.âFollow
ing its decision to grant 'a large subsidy
to the Canadian Pacific Navigation Com
pany's steamers on the Vancouver-Skag
way route, the Canadian Government now
proposes to take another step which will
have a far-reaching effect against .Amer
ican steamers and in favor' of Canadian
boats. It is proposed to do away with an
order made by the' Ottawa Government
three years ago, which provided that
bonded freight from Vancouver for the
Canadian Yukon might be sent to Skag
way in American vessels. This was done
to accommodate shippers In the days of
tbe northern rush, when the Canadian
boats were unable to handle all tbe trade.
Special Dispatch^to The Call.
PBESIDENTIAL " OTJTLOOK.
The- color discussion has'overshadowed
the presidential race to-day, but, at the
same time, reports are flying fast. There
seems to be â¢ a feeling that the Decker
forces are gaining ground. A Colorado
omar >u^ ald , that seventeen
fatates had already announced their In
tention of voting for her. Some idea of
the statement of the convention in this
connection may be ascertained to-morrow
afternoon, when Mrs. Decker appears on
the programme. At '5 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon the nominating committee will
meet to make up the ticket. The rumor
that Mrs. Dennison has withdrawn was
promptly denied by her to-night. ' i
The report of the committee appointed
to secure a national charter, as made "by
Mrs. Mary Lockwood. called forth much
discussion and entanglement, especially
as Mrs. Bailey of New Jersey insisted on
presenting an opinion by Judge Dill the
corporation lawyer of New. York. This
committee, which was not compelled to
report to the convention in the first plac
was Instructed to continue the work of
accepting the charter and perfecting
under it, the new organization.
The invitation extended by Mrs. Wil
liam Tod Helmu'th of New York- that the
next convention be held in that city will
be referred, like the one from Minneapo
lis, to the board for action.
Another was Miss Jane Aduams of Hull
House, Chicago, who paid tribute to the
magnanimous position of Georgia in the
controversy, but declared race integrity
could best be. obtained through equality.
One of the last speeches was by Mrs.
Alice Bradford Mills of Chicago, who
made a strong plea for the continued
union of women of the North and the
South, and for the acceptance of the com
promise. ?
May Alden Ward of Boston, president
cf the Massachusetts Federation, said
to-night that there were two small points
on which that State was not . satisfied.
One was that j the convention suspended
the rules for a viva voce vote, instead of
by ballot, it being uncertain under the
circumstances that there was the neces
sary two-thirdj vote. The other point re
verts to a notice given by Miss Addams
that she wished to amend section 3 to
morrow morning at the continued busi
ness meeting, in order to make two in
stead of one dissenting voice on the
membership committee necessary to re
ject an application for membership. The
convention parliamentary rules provide
that sixty days' notice would be neces
sary to amend section 3, as it belonged
to the present : by-laws, but Mrs. Ward
said that section 3 allowed too large a
lcophole for the other side and Massa
chusetts wished the house would grant
Miss Addams Indulgence on this point
Mrs. Ward also said that Massachusetts
would have supported Mrs. Shields In her
substitute amendment had the word
"colored" been left out.
MISS ADBAJIS' APPEAL.
Â¦When' colored women are strong enough to
stand on an equal footing with the whites, let
us consider their admission, but In God's name,
let us not stop i their -..progress by admitting
them at this time. . \ , . . Â¦
When discussion was fully startedon
section 2, Mrs. Shields of Missouri, who
spoke as an individual woman who "^was
born a slave-owner, rather -than for the
State, offered a substitute amendment,
which though finally turned down with
a thud, ushered the heated debate. It
read: . . y . ..
That clubs containing colored women shall
be eligible to the General Federation in those
States and Territories in which they are eligi
ble to membership in their State and Territo
rial federations, and in other organizations
race eligibility shall be declared" by the two
thirds vote. /
/in the course of debate, whic"h, though
intense, was at all times collected and
clear, three speeches seemed to make a
marked impression on the audience. The
first one was by Mrs. Gallagher of Ohio,
who ended by saying: , .;
The president shall refer all applications for
membership to ' -the committee on
appointed by the board* of directors, for its
action upon the same. 'The action .of the com
mittee on membership shall be in .writing, and
a unanimous vote of tbe committee shall be re
quired to . elect. Inv-case the committee falls
to agree, the application shall be referred to
the whole board, the written vote of two-thirds
of which shall be necessary to elect to mem
bership. " . - .-, , Â¦:
From a St4te where a club is a member of
the State Federation, it would also be eligible
to ihe General Federation, If recommended by
the executive board cf the State Federation,
the power of admission to remain as given in
article II of the by-laws.
This section 3, which will come up to
morrow, should be given now, to help to
an understanding of the situation. It
reads: , . - :,' . 'Â¦ .
Section 2, which was considered and
finally adopted, reads: - '
THIS IS THE COMPBOMISE.

overwhelmingly to accept what is known
as the compromise amendment, 'agreed

On the opening day of the convention
it was evident the spirit of tolerance
would rule. Massachusetts did not ap
pear "dead set,"' and though : Georgia
gathered her southern forces and de
cided not to budge from her position,
there was absolutely no bitterness in the
preliminary talk outside the .convention
hall. This morning, as predicted, there
was suppressed excitement "during- the
consideration of the charter, which came
up first, and when Mrs. A. O. . cranger,
president of the Georgia Federation,
moved that sections 2 arid 3 of article. II,:
parts of the proposed amendments,- be
considered first, every one knew the batÂ«
tie was on." * ... *. -...-.

It was at this point and before the color |
discussion came up that th? charter ques--i
tion was postponed and Mrs. Lowe called I
for committee reports, crowded out at -a
previous session; chief of which was that :
of .Mrs. Dennlson, as chairman of. the
membership . commfttee. She stated that
Kansas was the banner. State, brlnging'in
new clubs to the number of sixty.
The last 'announcement of the morning
session came from Mrs. William Todd
Helinuth of New York, president of the
National Council' of Women,' who 'ex
tended an "invitation .-that the. next ; bien
nial be held in that city. The acceptance
is a matter of future consideration.
As predicted,. Mrs./ Bailey of New Jer
sey attempted" to- introduce the opinion' of
Judge . Dill of- New York, showing .that
the federation - is r not legally organized
under its present charter,, and this called
forth considerable sparring before she re
ceived the consent of the convention to
read her paper. In the course of the dis
cussion Mrs. Bailey further stated that
until there was a national code of cor
poration laws the federation would be
hampered by having a national "instead of
a State, charter. â¢
This flower feature, which is such a dis
tinguishing mark of the California con
vention, began by local committees meet
ing trains at outlying stations with loads
of bouquets. Almost every day during
the convention bunches of blossoms are
banded around, while the delegate who
dees not receive from'some source a bou
quet or a box of oranges at regular inter
vals belongs .to the Order of the Over
looked. Mrs. "Lowe's. room, moreover, is a
floral bower from morning till night. Â¦ Â¦' Â¦
After a squabble over tne report of the
reincorporation committee this morning
Its further consideration was postponeu.
The expected trouble over the charter
preceded these considerations and after a
series of parliamentary tangles, which
Mrs. Lowe handled -with her customary
power, further; discussion was postponed.
Mrs.' Lockwood made her report as chair
man of the committee, . stating that Con*
gress hadgranted the General Federation
a national- charter and that -it 'was the
last one . signed . by Â¦ .President. -, McKinley.
Mrs. Julia B. Shattuck'of Illinois. moved

'The "subjects of "The Educational Value

Mrs. Eben Smith of Illinois; * were dis
cussed by Mrs. "W. H. Bailey of Iowa;
who in her address. made this prophecy:
â¢When women realize what a carnage; the use
of wings,, aigrettes- and, plumage means to the

! The Audubon session led off with a re
port by Mrs. John Illick of Iowa, which
closed as follows:. ,
This department, with the purpose of bring
ing together the different societies created rfoi 1
the protection and propagation of bird life and
imparting to ea<Sh a knowledge of the - work
done by the others, has published' bulletins for

tion' in the States bearing upon this matter,

ing in. the United States which are interested
in : this . protective work. . .,;â¢-Â¦.â¢Â¦'*Â¦
But laws are not seft -executing*. That these
are -not entirely effective is evidenced by the
.frequent inquiry, '.'What has become 'Of. our
bird laws?" And; of the painful evidence .that
they yet' serve the milliner's art. It is doubt
less a. fact that women -are . the birds' worst
enemies. ; Ohly a couple ' of -years ago the re
port was" made that in one year . five - million
birds were slaughtered to bedeck women's head
gear. One million bobolinks were bereft of life,
70.0CO song birds' notes were stilled that their
plumage might be used for millinery purposes.

A Prominent Clergyman Tells
How He Escaped from His
Deadly Perils.
. When spring cornea . with its gentlÂ»
showers, its balmy air, its bright sunshine
and bursting buds, it too often brings to
our homes scenes ot suffering and physi-
cal decav.
The seeds of disease, which were imper-
ceptibly germinating during the winter
months, have developed and planted In the
system dangers that' now call for our in-
stant care and attention. Neglect and
procrastination will only deepen existing;
perils and lead to death.
Before the advent of spring, you must

you to put your full trust in that great

convince you that you have truly com-

Aldridge. a leading and prominent clergy-
man of Birmingham, Ala., says:
"I have been afflicted for ten years with
what I thought to be heart disease, but
after having the physicians examine me,
I learned that I was almost dead from
indigestion. They told me they could give
me medicine that would relieve me, but
there, was no permanent cure. Then I be-
gan using Paine's Celery Compound,
which gave me immediate relief, and I am
now well and enjoying good health. I can
recommend Paine's Celery Compound to>
be the best medicine for all ailments; If
people will use the Compound freely, they
will have no doctors' bills to pay."

Queen "Wilhelmina, although of robust
appearance, has always been somewhat
delicate, and her health has required very
careful attention. . . -
At 10 o'clock her Majesty was reported
to be sleeping quietly, and at that hour
her condition was practlally unchanged,.
The Dutch newspapers strangely publish
nothing concerning Queen Wilftelmina'a
Illness beyond the official bulletins and
brief expressions of thankfulness that her
Majesty 6 life has been saved. It Is no
longer concealed that the operation which
was performed last night was most dan
gerous, and that for an hour the patient's
life hung by a thread, causing the most
terrible suspense. Even now. although
the Queen's physicians are exceedingly
reticent. It Is .known that her condition
remains precarious and that everything
depends upon the strength of the pa
tient's constitution. There Is reasonable
hope for her Majesty's recovery, how
ever, provided that hemorrhage is avoid
ed. It Is now said her Majesty's doctors,
being no longer embarrassed by complica
tions In their patient's condition, will be
able to adopt more efficient means in
treating the typhoid. It is also held to be
exceedingly fortunate that the mishap of
last night occurred when It did. Instead of
a fortnight ago. It would then almost
certainly have proved fatal. Great hopes
are built on the fact that the Dutclv. Pre
mier. Dr. Kuyper, was not summoned to
the palace to-night.
The Dutch public Is strongly resentful
at learning that the truth of this case has
been long withheld and that reassuring
bulletins were issued while her Majesty's
condition was known to be dangerous.
This fact engenders some suspicion, and
anxiety as to the reliability of the bulle
tins issued to-day.
"Her Majesty's fever has not increased,
and we are quietly and hopefully awaiting
the result of a good night's rest for thÂ»
Queen. There is no cause for immediate
disquietude."
A bulletin posted at 2 p. m. announced
that the condition of Queen Â¦Wilhelmina
continued to be satisfactory.
The evening passed quietly at L.00 Pal
ace, but Drs. Roessingh and Pot have re
mained at the Queen's bedside. Baron
Clifford, master of the Queen's household,
said to-night:
THE HAGUE, May 5.â "It is a disap
pointment, but the Queen* is saved." Such
Is the general feeling regarding the sad
event of yesterday evening. The extreme
seriousness of her Majesty's Illness was
closely connected with the acute infec
tious malady from wh\ch she was con
valescing, and this complication involved
imminent danger of her death. The op
eration necessitated under such conditions
was performed without difficulty and
without the serious complications which
often arise in such cases. Consequently
the intense anxiety felt throughout the
castle has been replaced to 'some degree
by confidence, since the Queen'3 symp
toms continue to indicate that the dan
ger is no longer imminent.
A bulletin issued at Castle Loo this
morning Is as follows: "Ae has been
feared, the Illness of which Queen Wil
helmlna Is suffering put an end yesterday
evening to the hopes for a happy event,
the realization whereof was expected in
September next. All things considered,
her Majesty's condition is satisfactory at
the present moment."

Several days ago a number of Indians
visited the camp and taunted Hansen with
having sold his daughter to the white
man Then Hansen and Johnson, both
intoxicated, commenced to fight, the
young woman taking the part of John
son. During the conflict . a lamp was
knocked down and a fire started. While
the camp was burning the Indians fled
in a canoe. Johnson followed in another,
and paddling after his fellow brawlers he
grasped their craft and the fight was re
sumed. While the struggle was in prog

the contestants reached the shore.
Two Indians who had taken part in the
fight in the camp, but who did not go
out in the canoes, witnessed the tragedy.
Johnson became enamored of the daugh

girl. This Hansen at first refused to "ac

The answer of the Northern Securities
Company is divided into two parts. The
first Is largely a denial of the petition as
respecting any charge. of conspiracy and
as respecting the purposes of the organ
ization of the Securities Company. In
stead of owning a majority of the shares
of the Great Northern or Northern Pa
cific companies, it Is stated that those who
are interested in the organization of the
Securities Company did not own within
$26,000,000 of a majority .of the Great
Northern shares and little more than one
quarter of the Northern Pacific shares.
This part jot the answer states that the
Securities X'ompany has acquired by
transfer on the Great Northern , books
about five-twelfths of that company's
stock, has negotiated for about four
twelfths of the total of such stock which
has not been transferred and as to which
it has at present no .voting power, and
has paid on account of Great Northern
and Northern Pacific ' shares purchased
over $40,000,000 in cash; that many stock
holders have not and may not sell shares,
and' that neither company by any act or
suggestion has solicited shareholders to
sell to the Securities Company.
In the second part of the answer the
purchase of the Chicago, BurliHgton and
Quincy Railway Company is taken up,
the reasons for such purchase having
been, it is alleged, "erroneously stated. in
the petition."' Attention is called to the
sparsely settled or unsettled nature of the
country ; through which the Great North

of trade with Eastern Asia as a means

transcontinental lines (including the Can

it competes for the commerce of the

in competition witfl the rates of ocean

received 157,716 votes, while her
opponent. Miss Gertrude Plumb, received
68.609 votes. The May Queen will at once
select her robes to be worn at the corona

occasion the Queen and her maids of

cities, will appear in fluffy white gar

many attractive equipages in line.

over which he kept a watchful eye until
1876; founded a number of religious com
munities, established a reformatory for
boys, a refuge for misguided women and

On October 1, 1880. Bishop Corrigan was
made coadjutor, with the right of succes

of New York, under the title of Arch
bishop of Petra, and thereafter nearly all
the practical work of the archdiocese fell
Into his hands. By this time the Catholic
schools of New Jersey had increased to
150, having nearly 30,000 pupils, with 150
churches and 172 priests.
Archbishop Corrigan was then the
youngest archbishop, as he had been the
youngest bishop, of the Catholic church
in America. From the beginning of his
ecclesiastical career honors had fallen to
him In a most unusual way, but never did
they change his manner or course of con

had adopted from the first.
In 1884 Archbishop Corrigan was sum

York in the Plenary Council, called to ad

Archbishop Corrigan was Â¦ a profound
scholar, and, although not a great orator,
a most agreeable preacher, impressing his
hearers without resorting to any of the
usual rhetorical means of gaining and
holding their attention. His office was
conducted in a masterful manner, though
often under conditions and circumstances
the reverse of peaceful, being not infre
quently disturbed by the most bitter and
harassing internal dissensions, through all
of which with remarkable tact and judg
ment he managed to steer his course so
as to gain tne respect even of bis oppo
nents and those who disliked his public
attitude as a member of the Catholic
hierarchy of America.

father is a prominent official connected
with the railroad company, called upon

he had $S0 on deposit with the Home Sav
ings Bank, Detroit, Mich., and as he was
in need of funds he asked Medau if he
would cash a check for the â¢ amount to
oblige him. Medau complied and the
check was returned marked "no account."

son, Wilson â 6.
Noes â Alpers, Bent, Boxton, Brandenstein,
Braunhart, Curtis, D'Ancona Eggers, Lough
ery. Lynch, McClellan, Wynn â 12.
Brandenstein said the ordinances would
prevent a man from going into a corner
grocery and playing for a 5-cent chip.
"We do not desire to impose , a burden
on the general public," said Brandenstein,
"so I would oppose any such drastic
measure as working a hardship and be
ing too sweeping. The ordinances would
prevent a man from playing cards for a
giass of beer. I would suggest that the
measures be returned to the Police Com
mission to be redrafted, with a view to
removing its oppressive features and to
cover the evil intended to be suppressed."
Braunhart held that the remedy lies in
the hands of the Police Commission, who
may revoke the licenses of any man found
prosecuting any nefarious business.
Commissioner Hutton of the Police
Board stated that the ordinances were
proposed on acount "of the frequent com
plaints against the Cafe Royal and other

was in progress and he lost $35 in five
minutes, and he added that the offlcer is
considered a good poker player.
"The officer reported that five queens
had been dealt from one pack," said Hut
ton, "and we concluded that a man had
no chance in such games. We desire to
reach the professional sharpers by., these
ordinances."
The Board of Supervisors yesterday de
feated the three proposed ordinances pro
hibiting the playing or dealing of card
games for money or becoming a visitor
to such games in places where liquors are
sold.

ley and South Francisco and contiguous Jo the
properties of the Southern Pacific Company.
The ordinance was referred to the Street
Committee.
A proposed ordinance accompanies the
petition and specifies the following streets
intended to be crossed by the railroad:
Your petitioner desires to establish engine
houses, shops and yards upon its own proper
ties in the district bounded by Fourth. Channel,
Kentucky. Sixth and Sixteenth streets, and be
tween Sixteenth. Kentucky, Mariposa streets,
and Pennsylvania avenue, and to connect such
shops and engine houses with its mala line of

the necessary right of way except where said
lines cross or run along public streets and high
ways, and that construction work will be com
menced as soon as permission is granted.

of Supervisors for a franchise to enter the
city at a point where the southerly bound
ary line of the city and county is inter
sected by Sunnyside avenue and to run
thence in a northerly direction to the
northeast line of Sixth street, opposite
South, and to construct certain branch
lines connected with said railroad on cer
tain designated streets. The petition
says:
To regulate street railways, tracks and
cars; to compel two lines of street rail
way operated under different manage
ment to use the same street, each paying
an equal portion for the construction cf
the tracks and appurtenances used by
said railways jointly; but in no case must
two lines of street railway operated under
different managements occupy and use
the same street or tracks for a distance
of more than ten blocks consecutively; to
fix, establish and reduce the fares and
charges for transporting passengers and
goods thereon; to regulate rates of speed,
and to pass ordinances to protect the
public from danger or inconvenience in
the operation of such roads.

Charter Amendments be instructed to

The Board of Public "Works through the
city engineer . was requested to prepare
plans and estimates of the cost of the
original construction or reconstruction
and completion of a municipal electric
railroad along the following described
routes and to file said plans and estimates
with the Supervisors:

buildings for school purposes on account of
wear and tear, and constant use for many
years without necessary and required improve
ments.

Overcrowding of the present classrooms; un
sanitary conditions resulting from such over
crowding and deterioration of educational
standards arising from excess of pupils in the
various" classes.
Inadequacy of the present school buildings
to contain and provide accommodation for the
pupils already enrolled and for children of
school age desirous of entering the schools; im
possibility under the present conditions of re
ceiving into the public schools a large number

struction of new buildings for school purposes,
the character of such necessity and emergency
being as follows:

SUPREME COURT DECIDES
CHINESE TRANSIT CASES
The names of -the two . Chinamen .who
figured in the cases decided to-day are
Fook Yung Yo and Lee Gon Yung: Both
were on their way to Mexico, and claimed
the right under the treaty of 1894 to tran
sit, one desiring to go by rail and the oth
er merely to transship.
They were denied this right under the
provision of the treaty giving the Treas
ury Department authority to make regu
lations for control in such matters. The
Federal authorities discovered evidences
In both cases, as in those of their de
tained countrymen, that the passengers
did not intend to remain In Mexico. The
WASHINGTON, May 5.â The
Chief Justice of the j United
States Supreme Court' to-day
rendered opinions in two test
cases affecting the transit of
Chinamen through' the United States to
other countries, sustaining the govern
mental authorities in having them de
tained at San Francisco. There are said
to be forty -or fifty Chinamen who have
been thus detained in San* Francisco for
the past four or five months and who
have been very restless under the re
straint. The result of the decision will be
the deportation to China of the Chinese
detained.

Chief Deputy Vogelsang regards the
capture as very important- in view of the
fact that many parties are made up in
San Francisco and other cities to hunt in
Lake County in violation of^the game
laws. He considers that- the knowledge
that the Commissioners will prosecute of
fenders will have a salutary effect on
other forgetful hunters.
After some protestation they consented
to accompany the officers to Kelseyville,
about forty-five miles distant. By ar
rangement with the deputies four of the
men entered a plea of guilty' and were
fined $25 each by Justice of the Peace
Gunn.'. The other two were allowed to. go
free with a warning.
Deputy Fish Commissioners A. F. Lea
and L. N; Kercheval made an important
capture of same law violators in Big
Squaw Valley, Lake County, on Thursday
of last week. The offenders, six in num
ber, had set up a camp in the locality
where they were apprehended," and are
said -to have been making a practice of
shooting ' deer whenever opportunity of
fered. '
The party was composed of Raymond
Hill, a stage driver; F. B. Marble and
Benjamin Milton, two prominent cattle
men of Uklah; O. Cleveland, ex-City Mar
shal of Uklah; Frank Hittell, a lawyer of
this city, and Â¦ Carl Hittell, his brother,

The preliminary examination of Joseph

Hamilton, Thomas Barker and Annie Bar
ker on the charge of burglary for break-
Ing into the rooms of Mrs. Anna Murray,
208 Powell street, on the night of April
23 or the morning of April 24 was continued
before Judge Mogan yesterday. Kittle
Nihlll, when called for cross-examination,
said she had to make another statement.
She said she saw . King and Hamilton
leave the house at 835 Howard street about
10 o'clock on the night of April 23 and re
turn between 11 and 11:30 with the stolen
property. She was then cross-examined
at considerable length by Attorney Archie
Campbell and King.
The charge against the three male de
fendants and Kittle Nihill for entering
the rooms of the "Women's Christian
Union at 132 McAllister street was then
taken up. Miss Elizabeth E. Shepherd
Identified a trunk and Its contents as her
property. It had been stolen from 132

Evidence Taken at the Preliminary
TESTIMONY AGAINST '
CONVICT PREACHER
Annie M. . Martin is being sued for di
vorce on the ground of desertion by John
A. Martin, who alleges that his wife left
him in April, 1898. They were married in
July, 1894.
Elizabeth R. Knowlton Is suing Joseph
Knowlton for divorce for desertion and
failure to provide. They were married at
Gilroy in June, 1870. Mrs. Knowlton al
leges that her husband is worth $5000.
Maggie Alden brought a suit for divorce
against Charles Alden, a blacksmith, yes
terday, alleging . failure to provide. The
Aldens were married in 1886 in San
Joaquin County.
To Seellger's diplomacy is due the peace
ful ending of what promised to be a sen
sational suit. He agreed to give his wife
the alimony she demanded, but refused to,
give his consent to her taking the house
hold furniture, giving as his reason that
he expected his wife would return to lum
within a year. He offered her the value
of the furniture in order that their house
might not be disturbed. Her husband's
kindness caused Mrs. Seeliger to feel that
she was doing him an Injustice in, charg
ing him with cruelty, and she consented
to meet him. They met and a dismissal
of the divorce suit followed.
The suit for divorce instituted against
Ludwig Seeliger, the prominent butcher
at 3318 Mission street, . by Annie Seeliger
will not come, up for trial. The couple
have patched up their differences and will
resume the happy relations which existed
before Mrs. Seeliger sought the aid of the
divorce courts. She charged her husband
with treating her cruelly and asked the
court to awarfl her $75 alimony.

bagged.
Ellis Baker, the watchman of a chicken
car at Six"th and Townsend streets, who
was supposed to have been sandbagged
and robbed in the car early Sunday morn
ing, regained consciousness yesterday
morning at the Emergency Hospital. He
made a statement that he had been drink
ing with three strange men in a saloon
in the neighborhood and remembered re
turning to the car and entering it, but
that was all he could remember. He had
been robbed of about $20. He had him
self placed the dead chickens in the sacks
to throw them away, as they were use
less for food.
As there were no bruises .or cuts on any
portion of Bauer's body the police have
arrived at the conclusion that he was
given "knockout drops" in the saloon
and robbed after he had become uncon
scious in the car. Every effort will be
made to discover the men who adminis
tered the "knockout drops," but with
small chance of success, as Baker says
he cannot recall the faces of the three
men. He was removed from the hospital
to the New Western Hotel yesterday aft
ernoon.

the Fresno Chamber of Commerce. Mr.
Jennings accepted for the committee. The
party will be three hours in Fresno.
Among those to make the trip will be the
leading men in all the commercial organi
zations of San Francisco. The compli

same line as the action of the Promotion
Committee, which is working to promote
the prosperity of the counties north of
Tehachapl.
One hundred leading business houses of
San Francisco will be represented by the
party of business men who will start next
Thursday evening on a special train for a

Bakersfield the initial point of inspection.
This fact was given out by Rufus P. Jen
nings yesterday. The special train will
consist of five Pullmans. When the en
gineer throws open the throttle of the big
locomotive a pilgrimage of a sort that
is new to Sail Francisco will begin. No
one along the route will be in doubt what
the special train signifies. Banners with
letters large enough for reading at a dis
tance, as the train is whirled down the
valley and up again will make this an
nouncement: "San Francisco Business
Men's Excursion to Bakerstield and the
San Joaquin Valley." Â¦ .â¢ - .
Notification was sent out yesterday by
an energetic committee, to whom, the suc
cess in organizing the party is due, that

for the trip are asked by the committee to
take heed of that fact.

Mrs. May Webb* President Woman's
Kaffe-klatch Club, Menasha, Wis., is Advised
by Her Doctor to take Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, for Inflamma-
tion of the Womb, and is Cured. She says:
" Dear Mrs; Pinkham : â How little we appreciate health until
it has left us ; then it appears as the most precious gift to mankind.
I enjoyed good health until four years ago when I caught a severe
cold at the menstrual period. I thought little of it at that time, but
,when nine weeks after I found it had settled into inflammation of the
womb, I wished I had been more careful. I suffered agonies for
months ; lost my happy disposition, and nothing seemed worth having
if I could not have my health. My good old doctor, after prescribing
several worthless remedies, was good enough to say * Try Lydia E.
PiiLkham's Vegetable Compound, several of my patients have
Â¦ been cured through its use.' I did so ; I had great expectations, and it
did not disappoint me. Before the first bottle was, used I felt relief ;
I took it faithfully for nine weeks, and that blessed Compound surely
cured me. . It seemed to build up all the weak parts, allayed tha
inflammation, and brought blessed health back to me. I know how
to appreciate it, and I know also that it was due to Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Veg'etable Compound only." â Mrs. Mary Webb, Menasha, Wis.

The rush to the Northwest is due to the moderate
price of land, and if price alone be considered we can
not compete,- but when the fertility of the soil and
the value of its products are taken into consideration
the Northwest cannot compete with California. It
ought to be possible therefore to bring the better and

All of that is interesting to California. We have

Should it be foufid necessary for the powers to in
terfere a second time the consequences are likely/to
be serious not only for China, but for the whole*
world. Sharp disagreements arose between the offi
cers and the men of the various nations on the march
to Peking, and grave differences arose among diplo
mats and statesmen afterward. Those differences
have^been compromised, but they have not been set
tled; and now if a new policy is called for in dealing
with Ctina there may be war* in earnest
The critical nature of the situation is disclosed by
a dispatch from Washington to the effect that the
diplomats in that -city regard it as extremely probable
a general uprising throughout the empire .will oc
cur, and should that be so, the powers would have
to adopt toward China a policy widely different from
that pursued in suppressing the Boxer outbreak. It
seems that the "salutary lesson" which the powers
thought they were administering by the invasion has
proven to be anything but salutary. Nor can the re
sult be wondered at The harshness with which the
country was treated during the march to Peking was
not likely to diminish the hatred of the natives for
foreigners, and does not appear to hive caused so
% much wholesome terror of European I arms as was
hoped for. The consequence is that having done the
business wrong in the first instance, the powers may
have to undertake it again and do it differently.
From those facts we may conclude that while the
movement is liberal in its origin and leadership, the
disturbances of the country have had the inevitable
effect of arousing the worst elements of the popula
tion, and the leaders have been unable to control
them. The insurrection is no longer guided by an
intelligent spirit directed, to a definite end. It has
become something like the rising of a mob and car
ries destruction to everything in its way to which any
considerable element of the mob objects, whether
it be foreign or domestic.
While it is said by persons who are familiar with
Chinese affairs that Sun Yat Sen has the sympathy
of thousands of wealthy and progressive Chinese who
are opposed to the Dowager Empress and are eager
to bring China into harmony with Western civiliza
tion, the progress of the insurrection has been
marked by deeds which clearly attest that all of his
followers are not of that mind. Several missionaries
have been driven from their stations, the Christian
converts have been dispersed, one Jesuit has been
murdered, and there have been .observed among the
rioters persons carrying banners inscribed with the
words "Abolish the missionaries !"
That the progressive class of Chinese are active in
the movement is made certain by the fact that one of
its most conspicuous leaders is Sun Yat Sen, who is
well known as an opponent of the present dynasty,
and whose long residence in the United States and
Europe has made him a convert to Western ideas.
Some j-ears ago Sun Yat Sen was the subject of a
sensational incident in diplomacy. After flying from
.China to escape the Dowager Empress he went to
London, and while there was kidnaped on the street
and was taken to the Chinese embassy, where he
was held as a prisoner. Only the most strenuous
protests from the British Government saved him
from being put to death there and then. Upon being
released Sun Yat kept himself hidden for some time,
but he appears to have found encouragement enough
to induce him to return to China, where he has since
taken a prominent part in fomenting the insurrection.
REPORTS concerning the disturbances in
China are conflicting as regards the motives
and objects of the leaders of the insurrection,
but all agree that the situation is critical. It is said
by some that the disorders have been occasioned by
progressive Chinamen, who desire to overthrow the
Manchu dynasty and set up a more liberal govern
ment. Others assert that the disturbances are a re
vival of the old Boxer outbreak against foreigners,
and represent anything rather than liberalism. Each
of these views probably contains an element of truth;
and the insurrection may prove to be an uprising of
all the discontented elements of the southern prov
inces of the empire, each hoping to profit by the dis
turbances that all help to create.
THE CHINESE PROBLEM.
It is. to be borne in mind, of course, that the
Hampton school is designed not to make scholars,
but workers. As was stated by General Armstrong,
who founded the institute: '?The temporal salvation
of the colored race for some time to come is to be
Won out of the ground.- Skillful agriculturists' and
mechanics are needed rather than poets and orators."
It may be that the object for which they were work
ing had something to do in shaping the judgment of
the Hampton faculty on the comparative merits of
the two systems of training. What has been found
helpful to -the and aimed at by 'Hampton might not
be found helpful in a school with different objects in
view. Under any circumstances, however, the re
port is interesting, and if may be this colored school
is working out a system of education which the
whites may find it of advantage Â£0 adopt, at least to
a partial extent. -
While it is not safe to argue from this report from
Hampton that it would be better to increase the
amount of industrial training in .our .public schools
by making a corresponding diminution in the
amount of academic training, still .such argument as
can be drawn from itjat all, is. decidedly in. favor. of
industrial education. The boy who learns to do
things develops intellectually up to a. certain point
as much. as the boy who learns to know things, and
has the advantage that his ability to do something
that the world is willing to pay for gives him a cer
tain independence which the other does not possess,
and from that sense of usefulness comes a moral as
well as a mental gain.
"Concerning the experiment the report says: "We
have watched with interest the results of these two
kinds of training and, while it is yet too early to
speak definitely, we incline to the opinion that our
trade school boys, who set out in their second year
to master some particular branch of industry, are
stronger, mentally and morally, than those who take
the regular academic course. It may be said that the
object of. school life is' not to make carpenters, but
to make men. Whi!e this is true, the making of a
good carpenter goes far toward the making of a
good man. The effect, upon these young people of
feeling that they are able to produce something valu
able, for 'which the world is willing to pay, is most
helpful."
â¢The report ' sets forth some of the results attained
by industrial education as compared with academic
education. A large .number of boys, after speeding
a year at farm work, working- air day and attending
the night school, proceed to take three years in the
trade school, continuing to attend the night school
for academic training,' while others spend the three
years in the academic department and take manual
training twice -a week. Thus jhere is a fair chance to
note which training is .best. . . -
It, is not upon ;numbers only, however, that the
reputation of; the institute rests. 'While it does not
aim at what is generally known as "higher educa
tion," it none the less accomplishes a widely useful
work in fitting the youth of the negro race for living
useful and successful lives' and in training teachers
who are to. help forward the great work. The re
sults of ; the experiments of such a school may be
studied with profit by all who are interested in educa
tional methods. ' \' - â¢' c ;;Â¦;,
HAMPTON INSTITUTE has grown to be one
of r our most notable educational centers. Ac
cording to the 'thirty-fourth annual .report,
which has just been published, 1079 youths of both
sexes have received . instruction on the. school
grounds during the winter term, the attendance at the
last summer institute was 347, and the industrial
classes at Norfolk have an enrollment of 1976, while
the Huntington classes, at /Newport News have an
attendance of 807, making â¢ a 1 total' of 4209 students at
Hampton, "or. in its immediate neighborhood, under
the care of the institute. So far as the number of
students goes, therefore, it is one of the. foremost
schools of the country. . >

in safety. If this is not done, the breach made by
Sibley is sure to tfiden and thousands will- walk
through it. Wise men have not failed to note the
utter aSsence of popular enthusiasm about the war.
One Major General, in his testimony before the Phil
ippine Committee of the Senate, said that it was a
conquest that had no glory, and that he had winced at
every blow he had been compelled to strike at a de
fenseless people. All such expressions combine to
attAct on one side the public sentiment that is re
pelled on the other by deeds that make an American
toss on his pillow and dream uneasily. Let leaders
be admonished, and beware the danger line.
Let the members and leaders of the Republican
party not only heed but lead this sentiment. Let them
declare that the party is not to be identified with the
wholesale murder of children and worse than the
From a merely partisan point of view this is most
fortunate for the Republican party. There was a
manifest determination in some quarters to suppress
all criticism of such acts of savage brutality as have
disgraced our arms in Samar and elsewhere. With a
well-defined insolence the people affected with Fun
stonism had gone forth snubbing as "sickly senti
mentality" every expression of humanity which dep
recated the universal arson and slaughter of children,
to make a howling wilderness of the country. There
was a feeling that if such appalling deeds were the
price .of conquest it was too much .to pay. But cer
tain smug clerics and smugger laymen were deriding
this rising spirit Sibley has given.it liberty to speak,
and the- conscience of the country is enfranchised to
be uttered once more.
From another quarter rises a sentiment which will
ally itself to disappointed commercial expectation.
This is the growing bitterness against military meth
ods. When- this was confined to the anti-imperialists
it caused no uneasiness. They were led by men of
impracticable views and methods, who had proceeded
on lines that did not command the support of num
bers whose general sympathies were that way. But
now this is all changed. The speech of Sibley of
Pennsylvania, a Republican and a leading"expansion
ist, has given voice to long-suppressed feeling. His
speech was immediately followed by a release of Re
publican sentiment most formidable in its character.
IT is evident that our military administration in
the Philippines is approaching the danger line.
" By that we mean the line beyond which public
sentiment becomes a hostile force. The risk may not
be limited to the military policy and practice alone,
but arises also- in features of our civil policy.--.;
It is a strange and inconsistent feature in the" latter
that all the voices which from the beginning have
been raised for the permanent/ occupancy of the Phil
ippines have planted that policy upon the argument
of cqmmcrcial profit. By commerce in the island
products we are to get back the cost of war, we art
to pay ihe. military pensions, a bountiful crop of
which our conquest daily sows the seed, and the
country has been taught to look over the smoke of
battle, far beyond its bloody fields, to the commer
cial future. This enchanting picture of prpfit has
been spread in all its colors before the American vis
ion, and the effect has been to raise expectation and
to whet appetite and reconcile vast numbers to the
cost of securing results so satisfactory to the com
mercial spirit.â.
But when this method of pacifying our own people
has worked its way, the laws of Congress come, pro
hibiting the entry of American capital and energy
into the islands in the only form in which a dollar
of profit can be gained. The effect of our
is to exclude from the whole archipelago everything
American except the army and a few civuV office
holders and some school teachers. Economic effort
for whatever it may be worth as a placating force
is absolutely excluded. *ThÂ£ Call has printed from the
letters of Frank Carpenter and the speeches of Sen
ator Beveridge, Mr. Barrett, and others ' the com.
mercial view, directing the only way in which ex
pectations of profit can be realized, and we have also
tried to demonstrate that commercial exploitation
may mean material progress of the natives, and cause
them to look more kindly upon our presence there.
But it is not the policy of Congress, so that the sen
timent which that expectation has controlled may
Jose its interest in the Philippines. '

NEWS OF THE OCEAN".
U. S. REVENUE CUTTER
WHICH WILL SAIL FOR
ALASKA THIS MONTH.
The speaking of ihe Red Rock has
started afresh the talk of a job on the
part of unknown speculators. The Red
Rock left Fraser River December 3 for
Queenstown". with a cargo of salmon. She
sailed in the gale that sent to the bottom
the British gunboat Condor and wrecked
the collier Matteawan. A few weeks
later a life buoy, bearing her name was
picked up. Then there came ashore sev
eral cases, of salmon said to have been
stowed in the limejuicer's hold. News of
these discoveries was promptly cabled to
London, where the underwriters in their
eagerness to get from under sent up the
rate of reinsurance to 50 per cent. The
eagerness with which the risk was played
at this figure made the British market
suspicious, and the Red Rock rate fell to
10 per cent. About the time the ship was
due at Queenstown a few more cases of
salmon were found on the northern beach.
"With the report of this latest find was
cabled the Information that the washed
up salmon had been ."stowed in the ves
sel's lower hold. It waf this last "dis
covery" and the care with which the re
port of It was sent abroad that gave rise
to the suspicion that the. northern beach
might have been salted at the instigation
of unscrupulous speculators. The exist
ence of this suspicion frustrated the Job,
If job it was, and although the. rate has
climbed up to 30 per cent that latest dis
covery of salmon had little effect on the
market. The losing overboard of cases of
salmon is an unusual occurrence. It hap
pened two years ago on the British ship
Ardnamurchan. She was placed on the
reinsured list, and those that played her
to arrive won handsomely. It is thought
likely that the case of tne Ardnamurchan
gave the clew for the manipulation of the
Red Rock scheme. The arrival of the
Red Rock at Queenstown is awaited with
interest, and if the captain's report fails
to confirm the loss of salmon there will
be a rigid .investigation into the source of
the reports ,that caused the underwriters
to reinsure their risk.
started,' was spoken April 11 in
latitude -1 north, longitude 30 west. Word
of the speaking was cabled yesterday ,to
the Merchants' Exchange, and the Red
Rock, quoted at 30 per cent, was wiped
off the reinsurance board. The Red Rock
was spoken about 350 miles northeast of.
Cape St. Roque,' and is due any day how

It is an accepted fact, a proven fact
that dandruff is a germ disease; and' it Is
also a demonstrated fact that Newbro's
Herpicide kills the dandruff germ. With-
out dandruff falling hair will stop, and
thin hair will thicken. Herpicide not onlv
kills the dandruff germ, but it also makes
hair as soft as silk. It is the most de-
lightful hair dressing made. It cleanses
the scalp from dandruff and keeps it
clean and healthy. Itching and irrita-

Tho San , Francisco -market rules firm but
quiet. Some dealers are trying to advance Hog
products, but -not all of them have, yet agreed
to mark up prices. An advance Is likely to oc
cur any day, however. . ,
Chicago stood about the same. The market,
however. Is unsettled owing to the agitation
against the beef trust. Mail reports from New
York say that a squeeze in Lard . is expected
there, as the Gates party have corraled most
of the supply.
Provisions.
NEW YORK, May 5. â The disturbance and
anxiety which were felt in the financial world
this morning were much relieved before the
close of the day on the Stock Exchange. It
was known before the stock market opened
that the hopes entertained on Saturday of se
curing means to tide over the firms threatened
with embarrassment had failed, and there was
nothing to do for these houses but to announce
their inability to meet their contracts. In two
cases the falluree were fully expected, but the
third came as something of a surprise. There
was heavy liquidation on .the Stock, Exchange
when they were announced, but the effective
support offered the general market checked
the indiscriminate liquidation and Induced more
sober reflections. There is no doubt much dis
trust was felt for the fabric of credits gener
ally, owing to the ignorance of the extent to
which the collapse of the Webb-Meyer clocks
bad involved others. The development in the
stocks themselves was recognized to be not of
first Importance. The collapse of their prices
naturally reduced the' basis of credits, which
had been acquired on the fictitious and manip
ulative valuation. But the dazzling rise in the
prices for these securities had not attracted
any great speculative following. The trouble was
thus localized within a comparatively email
circle of Immediate participants in the specu
lation. This was soon demonstrated by the
movement of the general market and the ab
sence of financial trouble in other quarters.
There was the fear this morning that the re
eults must be faced of similar operations ;of
other pools in various specialties and even 'of
manipulative advances in standard railway
stocks; but the readiness with which offerings
were absorbed quieted the nervous excitement
and Induced some buying back of stocks by
hasty sellers. In fact, the day's net losses are
found to be quite Insignificant as a rule, and
not a few important etocks closed higher than
Saturday. The reports of copious rains In the
Southwest and the effective breaking of the
drouth conditions, which have kept awake anx
iety regarding the crops, was a material aid to
the recovery. The persistent upward course of
Louisville and Nashville was a sustaining in
fluence. Rumors were renewed of a combina
tion of this read with the â¢ Chicago, Indiana
polis and Louisville. The prospect of a strike
on the part of the anthracite miners and a
stringency of the money market will amply ac- .
count for a repre^Jon of speculation. As a
matter of fact, the active liquidation of the
first hour accounted for the early one-half of
the day's total dealings. Money loaned as
high as 20 per cent, and receded to 6 per cent
only after the principal demands had been met
There can be no doubt the discrimination
against collateral and unfavorable disposi
tion developed among money lenders toward the
recent indiscriminate tendency of the specu
lation were factors In the money stringency
The squeezing out process along this line is
viewed with satisfaction. The knowledge that
credits are very liberally expanded at present
and that the rather meager cash reserves are
subject to heavy demands has caused real anx
iety to be felt from the reckless speculation
indulged tn In some quarters.
Some of the speculative bonds were weak un
der forced liquidation, but the market recov
ered and became irregular in sympathy with
stocks. Total ealee. $4,030,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
thÂ£_last call.

FORECAST.
WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERALr
.CHICAGO, May 5. â Bears started In to dom
inate- wheat at the sound of the opening gong.
Bearish news was at hand in good array.
Cables were lower, receipts were improving,
but greatest of all factors was the heavy
rains that had come to the relief of Kansas and
Nebraska. Private wires had reports of crop
damages as usual, but the trade came to the
speedy conviction that all was not lost In the
Southwest. Estimates of the Kansas wheat
yield that had been as low as 25,000,000 bushels
a week ago were raised to-day by conservative
people to 50,000,000 bushels. St. Louis and
Kansas City sold heavily. July wheat opened
%<S%c to %@%c lower at 75%@75%c, touched
75%c and then slumped to 74%@~4%c. There
was a large short interest In wheat and on the
decline offerings were absorbed. Prices for
July rallied to 75c. .but at the close were weak,
l%c lower at 74%@75c. : .
Corn ruled weak on the Influence of rains
and the depression in wheat. July closed 94@
%c lower at 00%@i50%c.
Rains had a weakening effect in oats and
under the influence of the breaks in other
grains oats declined steadily. July closed %c
Icwer at 35%C
Steady hog prices at the yards held prices In
provisions from slumping in the pit". The close
was about steady, July pork a shade lower and
lard and ribs 2%a down. ;

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were lower, but
cargoes were firm. Paris futures were steady.
The world' 8 shipments for the week were as
follows, in quarters: Russian, 140.000; Danu
blan, 161,000; Argentine, 150,000; Indian,
50,000. ' The "American visible supply decreased
2,121,000 bushels. -
Chicago declined from 76%c to 74%c owing
to general rains over the whole Southwest and
from Nebraska to Ohio, which caused a selling
rush at the opening. * There were more buyers
than- sellers, at the decline. St. Louis sold
freely and holders realized heavily. The de
mand was ver- moderate. The market subse
quently turned somewhat firmer on .seaboard
reports of 40 loads taken for export, with more
working. Governor Stanley of Kansas aban
doned his intention of appointing a day of
prayer for rain, being confident now of abund
ant crops. ...

Cheese continues weak, with large stocks.
The firmness in Eggs continues. Buyers are
still out in the country purchasing for 'cold
storage on speculation, and some of them are
paying above the level of the San Francisco

Exchange again advanced Its quotations, quot
ing ranch. at 17@18c and gathered at 15@16c.
Receipts of Butter .were vory . heavy again,
as vlll be seen. Heavy packing, both here and
in the country, keeps stocks down to a manage
able point, and the market is steady. The
Exchange made another %c advance" in the up

HBALDSBURG, May 5. â Francis
George Smith committed' suicide last
night In a cell in the City Jail, during a
fit Of Insanity. Smith, who was 51 years
of age, was a married man, a native of
Germany; and owned a goat ranch in the
mountains twenty-nine miles west of
Healdsburg, where he lived with his wife.
Mrs. Smith came to town on Saturday
and got a warrant for the arrest of her
husband oh a charge of insanity. She then
returned 'home and told her husband that
officers were coming after him. Deputy
Sheriff J. C. Ingalls went after Smith
early yesterday morning. He met Mrs.
Smith on the road several mile3 from her
home. Leaving her there, he proceeded to
the house, and when within 100 yards of
it heard the report of a gun. The officer
hurried into> the house and found one
room full of powder smoke, but Smith
had lied. Following fresh tracks in the
grass which led into a deep canyon a half
mile away, he discovered Smith behind
some brush,, a large bjitcher knife* In his
hand and the blood running from his neck
and left wrist. The officer drew his pistol,
which was not loaded, and ordered Smith
to drop his knife. Smith begged him not
to shoot and readily surrendered.
Ingalls brought the insane man to town,
placing him in a cell in the City Jail.
When the cell was entered this morning
it was found that Smith had made
another : and this time a successful at
tempt to shuffle off this mortar coll. The
iron - bedstead in the cell is fastened to
the wall on either end by a slack chain.
Smith used the slack in one of these
chains to make a half hitch around his
neck, and then dropping on his knees suc
ceeded In strangling himself.

stub. The cotton burst into a blaze, the
stair pads were set fire and in an instant
the flames spread throughout the first
floor and mounted upward.
A panic ensued and disregarding the
fire escapes many of the employes jumped
! from rear windows to the roof of an ex

of the House Committee on Foreign Af
fairs in the interest of the Boers, Dr.vJ.
C. Hexamer of the National German Al
liance speaking first. He described the
heroic struggle of the Boers and urged
the adoption of a resolution asking the
President to communicate with Great Brit
ain an expression of sympathy for the
Boers and expressing the hope that tha
unfortunate differences may be settled.
He said that England at this time would
not take umbrage, being enfeebled with
the war. He said he advocated the reso
lutions as a Republican, and if they were
pigeonholed it would mean the loss of a
million votes for the German Alliance.
Dr. Keyser of the Boer legislative com
mittee said that the Governors of several
States were strongly pro-Boer. Through
Representative W. A. Smith a report of
I. M. de Bruyn was presented on the use
of New Orleans as a base for military
supplies for Great Britain. Others spoke
of the use of American ports as supply
camps for the British army. Representa
tive Smith also urged action by Congress.
Representative ' Sulzer said millions Â£OT
Americans would approve a resolution of
sympathy.
Representative Adams of the sub-com
mittee, closing the hearing, took excep
tion to the introduction of politics, say
ing no such question was involved. He
said it was not a matter of domestic poli
tics, but international law'.

A NIGHT AT IRISH FAIR
PASADENA. May 5.â A telegram re
ceived to-day suddenly transformed
George A. Dold of this city from a day
laborer into thrice a millionaire. Dold is
a Virginian of English descent, a wan
derer on the face of the globe, but ne
comes of a wealthy family, and for twen
ty years he has been expecting this sum
mons from poverty to riches.
When he got the telegram he was hard
at work carting oranges for the Pasadena
Orange Growers* Association, at $1 50 a
day. He immediately quit work and de
manded his pay. Then he went to the
nearest clothing store and purchased a
suit.
"No more hard work for me," said he.
The estate of which Dold is one of the
heirs is valued at $15,000,000. It comes
from a line of Englishmen, the original
having been Captain Willis of tha French
army, a great-great-great-grandfather of
Dold on his mother's side. The estate
had been entangled In litigation for tha
past score of years, during which time
many heirs had died, leaving as the sola
inheritors on this side of the Atlantic
George A. Dold; his sister, Mrs. Fannie
Sands of Richmond, Va.; another sister,
Mrs. Willis Dold of Richmond; a brother,
Edwin P. Dold of Philadelphia, and a
cousin, Mrs. Thomas S. Dornnln of Nor
folk, Va. Major Sands, Dold's brother-in
law, who Is a lawyer* of Richmond, has
been working on the estate for years and
has won his case. There are several Eng
lish heirs, but It Is said that the $15,000,000
will be divided equally among the nv*
American heirs.
When Dold was asked to-day what he
intended doing with his vast wealth he
laughed and said he guessed he would get
married. He Is 40 years of age and his
parents are dead. His father and mother
owned a fine estate in Richmond at the
time of the war. Dold was for a time a
sailor. He enlisted with the Fourth Uni
ted States Cavalry, troop L, from San
Francisco and went to the Philippines,
where he served fifteen months. He ex
pects to get his money Immediately and
will settle in this city, after visiting rela
tives in the East.

WASHINGTON. May 5.â General Chaf
fee has cabled to the War Department the
following list of casualties at the battle
of Bayan, Mindanao, May 2, which was
described in his dispatches made public
yesterday:
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Real Estate Association, together
with representatives of the co-operating
district associations of real estate men,
held an all-day session in the rooms of the
State Board of .Trade yesterday. C. M.
Wooster, president of the, new organiza
tion, occupied the chair. Vice President
David Bush and all the recently elected
officers were present. N. Â¦ P. Chipman,
president of the State Board of Trade, was
in attendance to advise with the real
estate executive committee." . Â£
The organization grew out of the present
movement to promote the interior counties
and those of the coast and there is sym
pathetic action with the State Board of
Trade. The business of the day largely
consisted of the adoption of a constitu
tion and by-laws. The provisions were in
substantial accord with the suggestions
that proved to be acceptable when the
initial meeting was held in the hall of the
Chamber of Commerce. On no point was
One ofYhe provis'ions of general interest
makes it necessary for any real estate
man 'to secure membership in the local
association situated nearest to his place of
residence as preliminary to the enjoyment
of the privileges of the State organiza
tion. By this plariv only those who make
dealing in real estate their principal busi
ness will be enabled to take share in the
work in view by the California associa
tion. - During the day the by-laws of or
ganization of rear estate d ealera *" ,^e
large cities of the East were consulted
â¢and the essential features of the Eastern
plans were adapted to local use after
thorough discussion. The action of yes
terday completes the organization of the
new body and puts it in a position to at
once engage in its chosen field.
Please hand this key to my brother, Joseph
Jacobs, room 14, Thurlow Block, 126 Kearny
street. I have nothing to say for publication
except that reverses caused by sickness is my
only reason. I had no trouble with any of my
relatives or outsiders. . :
At 5:30 o'clock on Sunday afternoon he
engaged a room at the Burlington and
mailed a letter to his brother Joseph, in
forming him that he had gone to the Bur
lington for the purpose of committing
suicide and that his body would be found
in his room in the morning. When Jo
seph Jacobs opened his mail yesterday
morning he was horrified on reading his
brother Samuel's letter. He hurried to
the Burlington, and in company with the
clerk entered the room and found the
body of the suicide lying on the bed with
a roll of cotton batting covering his
mouth and nostrils and tied in place with
a linen handkerchief. The batting had
been saturated with chloroform. On the
bureau were a bottle one-quarter full of
chloroform, a kev and a business card,
on the back of which the suicide had
written in pencil:
Samuel Jacobs, . - brother - of Assistant
United States Treasurer Julius Jacobs of
this city, committed suicide last Sunday
night in his room in the Burlington Lodg
ing-house on Market street by inhaling
chloroform. Continued 111 health and con
sequent reverses in business prompted the
rash deed. Samuel had been a partner
with his brother, Joseph Jacobs, in the
business of manufaturers' agents on
Kearny street, but retired from the firm
shortly before he left for Manila. His
health was wrecked in that tropical coun
try and he was obliged to return to this
city. He obtained employment as a book
keeper, but after a half day's attempt
he found that he was not strong enough
to Jift heavy account books and he re
signed. :.. . -
After Judge Troutt announced his de
cision that the court was not prejudiced
and therefore no transfer would U3 grant
ed Attorney â¢ Pence ; moved the court to
postpone the hearing of the petition for
final distribution on the ground that he
intended, to file a suit against some of the
property of the estate.
This announcement caused considerable
surprise and developed, quite an argu
ment. Mr. Wheeler arose after Mr.
Pence took his seat and moved the court
to dismiss Mrs. Craven as a litigant on
the ground that it had already been de
cided that she had no right to the Fair
millions or any portion of them, and on
the further ground that Judge Slack had
already decided that the deeds that Mrs.
Craven held to -the Pine and Sansome
street property and the property at
Twelfth and Mission streets were for
geries. It is over this property that Mrs.
Craven's attorneys intend to bring suit
again. The case then went over until this
morning at 11 o'clock.
Superior Judge Troutt yesterday denied
the motion of the attorneys for Mrs. Net
tie Craven to have the proceedings of
final distribution, and settlement of the
litigation over the estate of James G. Fair
transferred to another department of the
Superior Court. The transfer was re
quested on the ground that Judge Troutt
was biased, and prejudiced against Mrs.
Craven. Affidavits made by Mr. Pence
and Judge Maguire tending io show preju
dice and bias on the part of Judge Troutt
were introduced, and on the other hand
counter affidavits were introduced by the
attorneys of the Fair children tending to
prove the contrary. Considerable argu
ment was indulged in between Pence and
Maguire, representing Mrs. Craven, and
McEnerney and Wheeler for the Fair
children. . ' .
The sand teamsters, who threatened to
go on strike if their demand for an in
crease of wages was not granted, re
ported for duty yesterday to a man. This
action was the result of. an agreement
reached with the contractors by which
the wages of the teamsters will be raised
25 cents a day on the first Monday in Au
gust. The men were in good spirits, and
they tay that the other demands made by
them eventually will be granted. They
are satisfied with the victory gained thus
far.
Fifty suspended members were rein
stated and fifteen new members were ini
tiated. The affairs of the union are in ex
cellent shape.
Boxmakers' Union, No. 152. met last
night and indorsed a new scale of wages
to be presented to the employers next
week. The demands of the union were
not divulged, but it is understood a small
increase in wages and a nine-hour day
will be insisted upon. Mayor Schmitz ad
dressed the union and was the recipient
of considerable attention. His remarks
concerning the manner of conducting
strikes peaceably were greeted with ap
plause.
The fact that the Morton people still
employ non-union drivers is responsible
for the trouble. ' The employes of the Mor
ton company declined to join, the union,
claiming they were being paid better
wages than the union drivers. This con
tention is denied by the union men. who
are in consequence greatly angered at the
Morton drivers. For some time past a
bittc-r feeling has been developing and the
union men now threaten to boycott not
only the Morton company, but any firm
employing the services of that company.
It was reported Jast night that many
retail merchants were warned during the
day not to do business with the Morton
company under penalty of a boycott. An
. official of the company said when inter
viewed that there was no truth in the
story. He intimated that threats of the
kind had been made, but that the com
pany had r^-id no attention to them. He
could give no reason for the reported ac
tion. If it was taken, and moreover he had
no iear of the outcome as far as the busi
ness ol the company was concerned.
The Retail Delivery' Drivers 1 Union has
a grievance against the Morton Special
Delivery which threatens to develop into
a boycott of the latter concern.
The will of Mrs. Susan G. Tevis was
filed for probate with the County Clerk
yesterday. It will be remembered that
Mrs. Tevis was the sole beneficiary of
the will of the late Lloyd Tevis, whose
estate was appraised at approximately
$8,000,000. This entire estate Mrs. Tevis
gave to her children and grand
children during her lifetime with the ex
ception of certain personal property of
the value of about $20,000, and this is the
entire estate to be administred upon by
her executors. In deeding her property
Mrs. Tevis gave to her children the
chare allowed by law. .
By her will the whole estate with the
exception of a few legacies of jewelry
is left to ' her four surviving children,
Harry L. Tevis. William S. Tevis, Mar
garet T. Blanding, wife of Gordon Blancl
irg, and Louise T. Sharon, wife of Fred
erick -W. Sharon, who each receive one
fifth, the remaining one-fifth being left
in trust for Alice Boalt Tevis and Hugh
Tovis, the children of the late Hugh
Tevis, until each child attains the age of
25 years, when such interest is to become
theirs' absolutely. .
Florence L. Breckinridge and John C.
Breckinridge, the two children of Mrs.
Frederick W. Sharon, issue of her first
marriage, who were adopted by Mrs,
Tevis, ara considered for all the purposes
of the will as the children of Mrs.
Sharon, the same as though they had
never been adopted.
Harry L. Tevis and William S. Tevis
are named in the will as executors, and
also as trustees of Alice Boalt Tevis and
Hugh Tevis. They are empowered to
serve without bonds.

Grape-Nuts Food Gave the Strength;
It ie a good thing to know of food that
will add volumes to one's strength, for
the strong can do things and accomplish
work in this world, while the weak must
stand to one side.
A woman in Toronto writes: "I was in
very poor health a long time and got so
weak and run down that I would often
etop at the foot of the stairs and wonder
how I could get to the top.
"I began using Grape-Xuts and In a
very short time that weak, broken down
feellngr entirely disappeared. I had for-
merly been forced to g1\-e up my break-
fast in order to give my stomach a rest,
but when I got hold of Grape-Nuts I could
eat breakfast, for the food seemed to
help digest other foods, and soon I began
to gain in weight and strength. 'S^>
"I regularly use fruit and Grape-Nuts
for breakfast and can work . harder and
for a longer- time than ever, before."

Sheriff Langford has evidence that Rob
inson was seen on the streets a short time
before the assault was committed, and
carried a short club In his hand. Robinson
tells a contradictory story, and the offi
cers believe they have the right man.
. The girl, while walking on the street,
was struck behind the ear with a club and
then carried into the garden surrounding
the residence of Mrs. Knox-Goodrich.
Here her assailant beat her into insensi
bility. The fellow " evidently " became
frightened, believing: he had committted
murder.
SAN JOSE, May 5.â The police and the
Sheriff believe that James Robinson, the.
young negro who reported having found
Mary Gabel in an unconscious condition,
on North First street early yesterday
morning-, was the young woman's assail
ant, and they are holding him in custody.
William de Arden, who was riding with,
the girl the previous evening, was fully
exonerated of any implication in the af
fair. Miss Gabel says De Arden was not
the man who attacked her. She describes
her assailant as being tall and slender,
dressed in a dark suit and hat and wear
ing a light mustache. This fits the de
scription of Robinson. â

and immediately joined In a conference

The first act. sets' out rather well., if
noisily, and with a little Judicious, prun
ing would go. One" is there. introduced, to
a fairly interesting' set: of characters, '. a
down-East -Yankee farmer, who promises
quite well, and whose- two' young' lady
daughters, -just arrived from school, are
a little too fine for their surroundings.
There "is also a bashful, elderly lover,
and a prim maiden lady who are good
fun and In Frank' Bacon's and -Juliet
Crosby's hands lend a spice. of conviction
to the atmosphere* But to these people
are added a crowd of others, whose chief
function seems -to be to contribute, noise.
The villain, whose mysterious sin never
seems to find him out, any more than the
audience does, is, however, . well - intro
duced and a good plot suggested.
The second act fails .to .develop the
story, but Instead drags in another, all
about a weepful young person who Is run
ning away with a soldier, who has 'had
the misfortune to come under the avuncu
lar guardian's displeasure, said- uncle be
ing the beforementioncd bashful " lover.
The Incident ' is 'wholly gratuitous and
serves no other purpose, than to draw at
tention from the . chief . characters. The
affairs of the Juvenile sister of the sup
posed heroin? are-also- treated upon, with
various other pasears into .' the unneces
sary .,,. . ,,,'..
The third act shows an orchard, with
all the. characters in- the cast - passing
Noah'8-ark fashion through it,, two by
two, each doing-his little stunt. 1 and 'the
same looseness and careless handling gov
ern the construction of the last. act . -
There ls some attempt at character
painting. George Osborne, Juliet -Crosby
and Frank Bacon have the benefit of it
and do well. Edith Cooper, <: a clever
youngster, also does good work in a pret
ty little part.
Mr. Alsop, Miss Convere, Mr. 'Scott ~(as
the villain), Mr. Howell and Miss Wal
drop did nobly, and the rest of the cast
filled In to their best. There was much
friendly enthusiasm that; was assisted by
the ushers. , and after, the third act , Mr.
Bryant thanked the audience 'for Its gen
erous reception' of the play, introducing
the electrician, the property man and a
couple of others, the chief-factors in Its
success. The- scenery was "good, and
doubtless the play will, go- 'with more
smoothness as the week goes '. on. It can
not, however, be said., to have p4t "Shore

Diedrich von Duering, an old, wealthy
and hitherto respected citizen of Lark
mead, Napa County,' was placed on trial
yesterday before a Jury in the. United
States District Court on a charge of tak
ing out of the postofSce at Calistoga let
ters addressed to Mrs. Robert Preitz, the
wife of Mrs. von Duering's brother. Mr*.
Preitz was residing with the Von Duer
ings while her husband, a marine en
gineer, was at sea, and last summer sha
discovered, according to her # testimony
yesterday afternoon, that Von Duering
had been corresponding in her name -with
Walter Luhn at St. Louis and was receiv
ing arid . perusing the replies. When she
learned what had been going. on she com
plained to Chief Postofflce Inspector Rob
ert R. Munro, who detailed one of the
brightest men of his force. Inspector Den
nis Coyne, to secure the evidence.
Von Duering shortly before his arrest
made . a statement and affidavit to exon
erate himself. He said that Mrs. Preitz
when coming from Europe to New York
on her way to join her husband became
smitten with Mr. Luhn on the steamer,
and that at her request he (Von Duering)
wrote several love letters in German for
her, she not being able to write very
Â¦well in the German language. He re
ceived the replies and gave them to Mrs.
Preitz. She told Von Duering that she
had had a champagne supper and lots ot
fun with Mr. Luhn in New York, and sho
would like to have a little more fun In
carrying on a . correspondence, and that
she was too young to live buried on a
farm. Von Duering related how, when he
had. two of the letters in hl3 pocket, he
had asked Robert Preitz, the woman's
husband, how much would he give for
proofs of his wife's infidelity, and that
Preitz replied that it would be worth $1000
to him. Von Duering added that he dM
not tell the husband about the letters be
cause he was afraid that Preitz would
leave Mrs. Preitz on his hands.
Senator Gesf ord of Napa for the de
fense argued that the whole matter was
a "Josh." First Assistant United States
Attorney Banning denounced Von Duer
ing as a man destitute of moral sense,
and while he was doing so Mrs. von
Duering, his wife, broke into sobs, and It
was some time before she regained her
composure.
Judge de Haven will charge the Jury at
10 o'clock this morning.
G. Barry, who the woman says is her
attorney and who also acted for Findlay
son, is not known In legal circles in San
Francisco. His name does not appear In
the directory, but' the telephone of the
"Countess' " fiat Is in his name.
The woman stated yesterday that Capi
talist Findlayson had resided in her house
for seven years and that she simply
looked upon him as. a friend and thought
it was her duty to be near him when he
was ill. She denied that she wanted to
secure Findlayson's property, but stated
that the capitalist had drawn a will. She'
3id not know what its contents Vere, she
3aid. . '
She claimed that A. C. Barry had drawn
iro the will "and that Barry would oppose
the application of Raum J to be r.ppointed
juardlan of Findlayson. -
The woman calling herself "Countess"
Ingorgolla and residing at 905 Ellis street
arid who stated last week that she was a
niece of Findlayson is now keeping her
self in seclusion and with her friend, A.
; C. Barry, who claims to be an attorney,
i seeks to show that she is only. a friend of
the stricken capitalist and solicitous for
his comfort and welfare.
: George Raum, a prominent business
man and friend, of Findlayson, has peti
tioned the Superior Court .of Marin
County, asking to be appointed the guar
dian of the person and property of Find
layson, who has no relatives in this coun
try.- . .
Findlayson is 62 years of age and a na
tive of Scotland. He amassed a fortune
in the wholesale liquor business and has
vast real estate holdings in California.
About three weeks ago he was sudden
ly -stricken ill while enjoying a game of
bowling at San Rafael. His physicians
say he is suffering from a clot of blood
on the brain and is likely to die at any
moment.
Last week "Countess" Ingorgolia called
at the Hotel Rafael and claimed she was
Flndlayson's niece. She demanded the
key to his strong box and informed the
hotel manager that she would have her
"uncle" removed to her home in San
Francisco. The hotel manager refused to
give the woman the key to the box and
attending physicians declined to allow the
sick man to be moved from his rooms.
The "Countess" then declared that
Findlayson had made a will in her favor
and that A. C. Barry, claiming to be an
attorney and who resides in her flat at 905
Eddy street, had drawn it.
Raum was informed of the woman's
statement and on Saturday last filed a
petition for letters of guardianship.
Raum's attorneys are Dorn & Dora of
this city and Theodore J. Savage of San
Rafael. His legal advisers have "received
instructions to protect Findlayson's prop
erty from all persons representing them
selves as friends or relatives of the sick
man. Raum also intends to contest the
will alleged to have been drawn in favor
of the "Countess" should the woman pre
sent the document for probate in the event
of Findlayson's death.
The "Countess" Ingorgolia is not known
in local society's realm and she declines to
give Â¦ any information as to her ante
cedants. She is between 40 and 45 years of
age and not prepossessing.- ' '
A few years agd she, was known as Miss
Ingorgolia. to the persons to whom sie
rented rooms in a flat on Post. street. A.
The protection of the courts is to be
thrown around the estate of James Find
layson, the capitalist, who is lying at the
point of death at the Hotel Rafael In San
Rafael, Marin County. ' '

"Please say as little ks you can about
the sale." said Hobart to The Call re
porter. "Some say I am broke and all
sorts of- things. I think that the less said
about the affair the better."
Hobart says t the place was too large for
him. "I can have just as much fun with
fewer horses and a smaller place," he ex
plains. - Â¦ .
Hobart came into possession of the land
sX Uurlingame as part of the estate left
him by his father, W. S. Hobart, the capi
talist and mining man, who died ten years
ajjo. The land was formerly owned by a
gambler named Whipple.
r The late W. S. Hobart built the race
trsek that is on the property and his
son .erected the present magnificent resi
dence, which is supposed to have cost
J100.COO.
Charles W. Clstrk has not decided when
he will move into his newly acquired
home. He intends taking a trip East be
fore he permanently moves to Burlingame.
In further conversation Hobart said
the sale had been discussed for the last
two. weeks. The. new owner, obtains pos
session of the magnificent stables and
racetrack.
"Well, if you want to know, I have sold
the house and 203 acres to Mr. Clark. I
shall retain 300 acres myself."
The topic appeared to be very distaste
ful to him ana ne showed great impat.ence
when he was pointedly asked if he had
sold the place.
. Rumors have been circulated that Ho
bart was in straitened circumstances;
his enemies said he was "broke." One by
one he has sold his linest equipages and
bis best horses. His colors are no longer
seen going to the post â in fact, the last
few montns Hobart has seldom appeared
in his old imposing manner at the leading
functions.
5 Yesterdav afternoon Hobart strolled out
of the "grill" and watched with much
interest Mr. Beylard's coach swing into
the courtyard of the Palace. He had just
finished luncheon and was immediately
surrounded by some of the Burlingame
set, who were anxious to know if the re
port that he was negotiating for the sale
of his country place at Burlingame was
true.

An accident similar in nature occurred
at exactly the same place about three
months ago, in which four were injured
one seriously. _ â¢ '
Nobody happened to be sitting in the
open part of the Washington-street car
where it was struck by the car on Mason
street, as fatalities in that case would
have been almost unavoidable. The collid
ing car crushed in the steps of the other
one and broke the flooring and seat into
splinters. The heavy trucks on the Wash
ington-street car were bent and it was
necessary. to insert new trucks before the
car could be moved and the track cleared
Following the usual custom of street
car companies, the officials refused to give
any information' regarding the names- of
those injured or the extent of their in
juries. Six of those seriously hurt were
given " emergency treatment at a drug
store on the corner of Washington and
Mason streets, the proprietor of which
showed commendable willingness and un
usual skill in handling the wounded.
As quickly as possible a wrecking crew
was gathered and the i work of clearing
the line began. So badly were both cars
damaged that it took four hours of hard
work before the line was again open to
traffic. â¢ : â¢ Â¦
OUTSIDE SEATS EMPTY.
-Somehow the gripman failed to see It
and kept the speed of his car unchecked
until a collision was unavoidable.- Some
of .the passengers on the car on Washing
ton, street assert that in addition to Grip
man Miller's negligence, J. C. Patterson,
the gripman of the other- car, ' t the
cable at the top of the hill and was en
deavoring to recover it on the wav down,
being compelled to neglect his car in the
meantime. .
Superintendent Skinner said that the re
sponsibility for the .accident rested with
E. M. Miller, the gripman of car 470,
which came -along Mason street, bound
north. The car on Washington street had
the right of way and an automatic signal
at the corner indicates when a car starts
to come down the Washington-street hill.
This signal was in working order and
registered properly, as was evident after
the collision.
James Hooper received three cuts on the
head, one of them being three inches
in length; : Tim Hopkins, a receiver for
the- Powell-street ' car line, had his nose
broken and face cut by being thrown up
against the front of the Mason-street car.
Several others received minor cuts, but
left the, scene of. the- wreck before their
names were ascertained. â¢

I^Â«jjT all depends upon what you want in a soap,

any soap will do. But if you care at all about
â¢' ? ' the thing which is to be washed, you must
think twice before you act. ' Any soap will clean linens.

That word hacking is expressive U.
those who have experienced the aggra-
vating constant cough, which is called a
hacking cough. Sometimes it is the
result of a cold, or of grip, and some-
times it is a consequence of catarrh,
â Â¦ which unchecked
JgpSLjp^ has gradually in-
ffJÂ»^L "\- yolved the lungs
M33Â§S5i in disease. Such a
/j cough finds its

ll^^S^^^^Sr\ was a sufferer from
I e. ~^*mmt^^ i catarrh and was treat-
, , . Â¦ . ed by one of the best
physicians in the State of North Carolina, who
said the trouble had reached my lungs," writes
Mr. J M. Patton. of Clotho. TransylVanla Co.
N. C r I grew worse every day until I tried Dr.
Pieree's medicines. Will say Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery with one bottle of Dr. Sage's
Catarrh Remedy cured me, and to-day I am well
and hearty, and I will say further that my
former physician, Vt. W. M. Lyday, recom-
mends Dr. Pierce's medicines to me and to
others. I am sure your medicines will core any
case of catarrh that exists. I recommend them
to alL",
If you ask your dealer for "Golden
Medical Discovery" because you have
confidence in its cures, do not allow
yourself to be switched off to a medicine
claimed to be "just as good," but which
you did not ask for and of which you
know nothing. - *
