Â«"f TJRRAH for the bathing girl again.
I \ This year she has come with more
I I vim than ever before and she has
X, I firmly announced that she Intends
+S to stay forever and aye.
Several summers back it was consider
ed the proper caper to take a drayload
of trunks to the seaside and stay there
as long as swelldom did. And in one of
the many trunks there was a dapper lit
tle suit that was popularly supposed to
sport with the big breakers that tried to
get frolicsome. Sometimes it did get wet,
but purely by accident; but it was not ac
cident that sent the same frock to the
water's edge day after day. No, that
was vanity.
But this year things hare been wholly
different. Bathing costumes have a com
bined dutyâ serviccableness and dainti
ness. How many girlg jknow how to
swim these days? Nearly all of them; in
fact, the girl who cannot tumble about
in the water is an exception these days.
Tank swimming has been so popular all
winter and so many impromptu little par-
ties have been made up on the spur of
the moment, that even the stragglers
knew it was high time for them, to make
a bluff at it anyhow.
Visit any of the tanks any night and
see the people enter the water. A chap
may dive In, and so may his sister, for
that matter, but she will generally climb
down the steps until she has felt the wa
ter and is half way in and then away she
goes every bit as gracefully as her
brother. She swims the breast stroke for
a while and then tries it over and over
until she catches up with him, and then
as like as not she will turn over on her
back and try floating for a time, just by
way of variety.
After fooling about for a' while up she
goes on the rings and with great swings
circles the tank until at last she is com
pelled to scramble back on the boards or
go into the water head first. Which does
she do? Without an instant's hesitation
she gives a good swing, throws up her
arms and slides into the water as easily
as any mermaid could.
That Is the bathing girl of 1902.
When such sport is considered a part
of her regular exercise, naturally she
must have some suit that Is distinctly her
own and that was made with a view to
suit her particular requirements. For if
there is one thing under the shining sun
that is more trying another, that
thing is a bathing suit.
After they are wet they cling 1 and stick
as closely as possible and the young lady
who has not the figure of Venus feels
rather shy at displaying all her defects
bo openly. .
But there are suits for everybody nowa
days. Visit Gantner & Mattern's and see
how they have taken the heavy and slen
der woman into careful consideration.
The stout woman, for Instance, should
wear a knitted, ,,woolen suit. ' The wool
clings and, what' makes it infinitely more
comfortable, it feels- much warmer and
more pleasant when in or out of the wa
ter. If one steps out to' go down the
the cold air does not rush in and
rive that nasty, clammy feeling that is
so apt to accompany mohair.
Instead of wearing bloomers, tights are
substituted and the best swimmers say
that nothing else comes anywhere near
them. If stockln g-s are wanted the tights
are made full length and the feet are in
certed, which make them delightfully
convenient. But they are j really not as
serviceable as ordinary hosiery, for no
matter how good the wool may be, there
Is more wear and tear on the soles of the
stockings than anywhere else, and while
the combination suits look smarter It is
cheaper to wear stockings.
Black or dark blue wool is tha best
color for heavy people, as both of them
have a tendency to reduce size. The best
and most swagger appearing ones are
buttoned up the back. The color, that
serves as:, a trimming' is woven in in the
form of a yoke and it is found- on the
bottom of the skirt and about the sleeves,
with just a suspicion abo.ut the collar,
ior most of these suits, by the- way, are
made with a tiny standing-up collar.
"When such a suit is donned it would tuke
a whale of a girl to look very large, and
it is one of the most useful and dressy
that one can buy, besides being the most
expensive.
But the wool may not constitute an en
tire suit, however. Frequently the tights
are used with a mohair top. In the ma^
Jorlty of cases the trousers extend a
little below the knee and are not supposed
to be worn with any hosiery. dark red
or a wine made up with whitÂ© is the most
fetching ever when worn by a brunette.
The skirt should be very full and box
pleats fit about the hips and are tucked
into the white stitched band. About six
inches of the white, with several rows of
red braid, finish the skirt as prettily as
anything and add nothing to its weight,
Â¦which means a great deal in this kind
of a frock.
And speaking of skirts, "whatever else
you do, do not have them that ungainly,
wretched length that makes of the pret
tiest girl a fright.- Have it shortâ the
shorter the better. Never below the
knees, for then it loses that something
which smart folks call chic.
jailor collars have been and always will
be just the right thing for the water.
Even they vary slightly in style. One
may be fastened Fnugly at the throat and
be absolutely guiltless of ornamentation,
â¢while the next one may be V-shappd and
a mass of applique work. Again it may
be square or it may be circular; it may
fasten over a vest and again it may bo
the only trimming the suit boasts of.
"Vests are coming In now, and right
swell they are, too. Take a dark blue
mohair, put a white tucked vest that
reaches from the throat to the waist
and that is fastened with tiny pearl but
tons, a wide collar of the blue with
straps of the white that gradually grows
smaller and smaller until it is lost in
the vest, and you have one of the most
swagger suits that has ever been turned
out.
For the girl who has more money than
she knows what to do with, the entire
costume of white has been made. Truly
it is a dear, but alas and alack! it does
not remain such long. "When trimmed
with black and white braid and when
worn with black stockings, white kid
beach shoes and a black and white silk
cap, nothing can be more stunning.
By the way, the bathing suit is only a
beginning; it is the accessories that cost.
There are the cutest slippers of kid. hel.l
in place by ribbons. They come in col
ors, but the white ones are the- most
worn. Ldttle holds them, bo thÂ»t If ths
Â¦water gets In it can promptly run out
again.
Stockings need not swell the price list,
as they are promptly being relegated to
the past, and for a good reason, too.
They only add more weight, and they
are always in rags and tags, which does
not improve one's appearance in the
least.
And there Is something new In caps,
also. The plain yellow rubber cap i3
all well enough, but no one ever thinks
of disputing the. fact that it is the ugli
est thins ever invented, and, as a con
sequence,, colored silk handkerchiefs are
always worn over them. , Eut the new
est cap does away with all the trouble.
It is a combination affair that works like
a charm. No water and no 'kerchief. In
shape it is triangular, and looks for all
the world like a piece of plaid oil silk.
The cap part is inside, and Is of tha
regulation rubber, but the under part
that shows is of the material, and ties
into a dog-ear bow.Â» It looks chic,- feel-*
comfortable and gives one a delicious
sense of spruceness.

The Summer Bathing CostumesÂ¦ something like the Vienna cream biscuit*,
but they differ in that they are- hard, b'u*
are never tough. Â»
\ "With such an assortment of canned
. goods as are offered . on every side and
with the travelling butcher visiting you
every morning, camping has been reduced
to a modern science.
Larkspur Is one of the most picturesqtiÂ»

three or four miles that seems put there
for that very reason. It is fine and daisy

cf people are patiently standing in line
waiting their turn to pass through the
gates. And the bundles! Ye gods! How
people can carry as much as an ordinary
rack mule is a puzzle forever.
Eut away they go. simply laden down
v.ith butter, meat and heaven knows what
that is needed and that cannot be bought
across the bay. Every once in a while a
bundle will stray and it takes half the
boat to restore it to its owner.
The campers say it is worth one's life
to drop anything on this side of the bay
cr on it, for that matter, for the simple
reason that nine out of ten people have
no free hand to assist their neighbor in
distress. But a man in trouble must be
helped, and one fellow gingerly stoops
and away goes his own tumbling after
the first and apparently having great
sport.
Probably if those bundles could talk
their conversation would be after this
fathion:
"Hi, there, Mr. Butter, run away as
fast as you can so the chap will put you
down a minute and we'll all slip."
"Well, I just guess I will," answered
the butter. "Just as soon as I get a
chance. Trust me."
k And then it promptly goes to work to
iaithfuliy carry out its promise.

will call out, and then all the listening

actual experience as well as scientific
knowledge, and also upon an acquaint

practical value of judicious selection. He
places before the reader in his 'sketch of

Arthur WInslow, the young minister,
wins for his wife the charming Isabel
Morris, whose first and great mistake is
that, she did not marry the other man,
Leonard Bylngton. Leonard and Arthur
have been close friends from boyhood's
early days and even now an effort is made
to preserve this friendship. Arthur's in
sane jealousy, however, gets the better of
him, and though he has won, by means
not entirely honorable, the fair Isabel
from his best friend, still the green mon
ster gives him no rest and he suspects a
clandestine love exists between Leonard
and Isabel. He stoops to all sorts of pet
ty meannesses and spying to trap his wife
until he"makes life a burden for her and
himself as well. The climax Is reached
one night when, carrying his Jealousy
even Into his dreams, he gets up In his
sleep and carefully drowns a bundle of
bedding and a huge rock in the near-by
lake under the Impression that he is kill
ing his wife;' then he returns to the house
and proceeds to strangle his wife under
the impression that sne Is his rival, Leon
ard Bylngton. This the lady resents so
forcibly that he Is thrown across the
room and awakened from his sleep. The
wife hides under the bed while the hus
band goes back to the pond to see if the
rock that figured in his dream has been
moved from its resting place. In his ab
sence Isabel thinks out a scheme and
rushes off to her mother's house, leaving
her Infant child asleep in Its cradle and
at the mercy of this crazy man. It Is evl
â¢dently dear in the wife's mind that Mr.

doubted If any other mother placed In a
similar position would have left her babe.

house fully under the impression that he
has killed his wife. The wife goes away
to a relative's house In the" South for a
few days and then comes back to stand
by the head of the crib for the dramatic
purpose of having her husband discover
her there when he thinks that she is ly

The Game of Love.
Hamlin Garland gat the Idea which was
to develop into "The Captain of the- Gray-
Horse Troop," recently published by tha
Harpers, away back in 1S07. At that time
he went in company with a young lieu
tenant, who was stationed at Fort Custer,
to see him inspect a drove of cattle which
had been brought into the Crow Indian
agency for sale to the Government, fior
the use of the Indians. The lleutenaCi,
noting the poor condition of the animals,,
rejected the entire herd, in spite of tho
demonstrative anger of the cattlemen.
Mr. Garland was impressed by the un
daunted action and few words of the
young army officer, and the character of
Captain Curtis took form In hi3 mind. It
tet him wondering as to the possible pow
er of a man like that if he were appoint
ed Indian agent. The lieutenant who in
spired the thought is now a captain, and
Is the head of the Forestry Department
In the Philippines.
The American Book Company of New
York has just published "Animals at
Home," by Lillian L. Bartlett. This little
supplementary reader contains material
suitable for the fourth or fifth grades. In
simple style it gives sketches of the lives
and habits of twenty-five representative
birds, animals, fishes and insects. These
are most interestingly presented and spe
cial care has been taken to make the sub
ject matter correct. The author has gone
to reliable sources for information, and
used the descriptions of eye-witnesses for
many of the incidents. The book is at
tractively illustrated from drawings and
photographs, and will tend to awaken in
the! child an appreciation for nature and
a love of nature-study. This volume is
the latest addition to /the popular series
of Eclectic School Readings. Price, 45

Animals at Home.
Thrall's wife refuses to give him up, al
though she does not love her husband,
but purely out of spite forces him to rec
ognize her as his wife and to establish her
In his own home. Sybil finds that she
loves the man too much to part from him
forever and eo their secret love continues.
Such a state of affairs exists until Jim
Roberts, a broken-down hanger-on of
Thrall's, overhears a conversation from
which he draws the conclusion that Sybil
Is about to be deserted by the man she
loves, ar.d In a drunken frenzy Jim ends
It all by killing Thrall. Roberts also has
a etory of his own, for Thrall has. been
the ruin and death of Jim's only sister at
t time prior to the beginning of the 6tory.
From the above brief outline an esti-
Sybil learns stage routine In minor parts
In one of Thrall's companies out West,
and then finally returns to appear as a so
ciety debutante In the role of Juliet to
Thrall's Romeo. She does not know that
Thrall has been a married man for the
past ten years and that his wife is still
living in London. She falls a victim to
his wiles and only learns the truth when
another of his mistresses, through mad
jealousy and anonymous letters, brings
the true wife on the scene. Here Is a fine
chance for a climax . and the author
makes the most of Itâ the Interview be
tween Sybil and Thrall after the wife has
dramatically announced her presence by
appearing in a box -at the theater in the
midst of the play.
The elder daughter tries to redeem the
family fortunes and through the acquain
tance of Claire Morrell, an actress of re
nown (rather a close approximation to
"Clara Morris," Is It not?) she meets
Stewart Thrall, an actor of distinction, a
manager of ability and a man who has
already ruined the life of more than one
young Â¦woman.
The author does some of her best work
in depicting the character of the wife,
this lodestone on the neck of a good man;
a selfish woman who would sacrifice her
own child to the licentious designs of an
old roue that she, the mother, might pro
fit by the daughter's sorrow. Fortunately
this woman lacks the brains to carry out
her fell designs, and Dorothy, the younger
daughter, becomes the wife of a noble and
true man.
The story itself deals with the struggles
of a well-bred and once wealthy family
in their fight against poverty. The father
Is one of those types of dear old gentle
men so well known. to us through Thack
eray's Colonel Xewcome. He is the true
gentleman of the old school, kind, cour
teous, considerate, but an easy mark for
schemers; so at the beginning of the
story we find him obliged to move into
obscurity with his two young daughters
end his fault-finding wife.
There is a certain consistency in the
character drawing, too, that shows the
authorship of one who has studied char*
acter and life through years of hard and
practical experience. A breach of this al
most perfect consistency occurs once, how
ever, in the story, and it is one that can
not be forgiven. The author finds it neces
sary to give her story a tragic end
ing, and has her hero-villain shot
down in the presence of the girl he
has wronged, but who has consent
ed to live with him a life of shame
because of the pure love she bears for
him. Any woman such as Sybil is shown
to be, who has given up all for a man.
Â¦would certainly not leave him when he
falls back dying in her arms; yet that is
exactly what the author forces her hero
ine to do. The reason for her so doing is,
of course, to clear her heroine's skirts
from, the scandal of the shooting and
have her story end with some possibility
of happiness, even though miserable at
the best. This part of the story is cer
tainly very lame in plausibility and most
unfortunate in reflecting discredit upon
otherwise excellent character drawing.
In "A Pasteboard Crown" it is easy to
seo the hand of the actress in the perfect
"stage business" of the book. The dia
logue is all practicalâ of the kind that
could be consistently spoken, even though
it often possesses the flavor of "gallery
play." The scenes that depict the reali
ties of stage life could not have been bet
ter done; for example, the description and
character work in that part which tells of
"The Costuming: of Juliet." The enthu
siasm of the old costumers, Lefcbvre and
Nonna Angelique, when they see the
model upon which they are to show u5:ir
skill, the turning out of boxes, thetryl?;?
on of this and that, the complete chan$a
of two old crabbed, commonplace people
Into inspired artists of their peculiar va
cation when they are given a subject
worthy of their work and professional
prideâ all this is told as only one versed
In the mysteries can tell it.
THE two books of the week that will
probably attract the most attention
are two that the world could very
well do withoutâ "A Pasteboard
Crown." by. Clara Morris, and "By
low Hill," by George W. Cable, published
by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.
Every one will wish to read "A Paste
bcard Crown" because it is the first novel
of one who in her day has been a great
stage favorite; and. in turn, "Bylow Hill"
v.-ill receive a hearing because it is the
â¢work of an author who has enjoyed popu
lar favor and who has better books to
his credit. Both of these books are well
Â¦written, melodramatic trash, most de
pressing in motif and altogether unwhole
some in moral.

A. T. Quiller-Couclu This story will be
found quite charming, for it is written in
Mr. Quiller-Couch's usual easy and enter
taining style. Some of this author's sto
ries are at times almost too morbid for
the average reader, but "this tale of awak

A Millionaire's Love Story.
Another detective story â¢ comes from
Guy Boothby, "A Millionaire's Love

fected by Mr. Boothby, plenty of compli
cation and adventure and rather interest
ing reading withal. Just enough plot and
excitement to carry you along without
too much effort or mental strain. This
time it is the adventures of George Kil

able assistance of Detective Burrell, car

Literary Notes.
The Illustrations in Hallie Erm!m>
Rives' new novel, "Hearts Courageous,"
are in some ways unusually notable. When
A. B. Wenzell was making the pictures
he was so enthusiastic over the book and
bo expectant for the excellence of his part
in it, that he asked the publishers to give
special treatment to the reproduction of
his drawings. It was at his suggestion
that M. Haider was engaged to make en
gravings on wood for Mr. Wenzell's very
attractive pictures.

mate of the moral flavor of the book can
be deduced. Stories of a worse tenor have
made great successes, but there has been
more literary merit in them than is evi
dent in. this novel by Clara Morris. It
seeins unfortunate that one possessing the
evident talent of this author and one so
well versed in phases of stage life should
have put her pen to the work of showing
the worst possible side of a theatrical
career. â¢ - . - ,
Her heroine Is pictured a'a a refined and
altogether lovable girl who might as well
have enjoyed the same beautiful life of
domesticity that fell to the younger
daughter but for her laudable effort to
support her family by taking up the only
course apparently open to her, that of a
life on the stage. Her histrionic success
is great, her moral downfall deplorable.
Thrall, as the actor, stands well at the
head of the profession; as a man he is of
the lowest, low. Even Jim, Roberts, with
his apparent kindness of heart and gen-

York State College of Forestry, that will
be found useful for those who are inter

in a commercial way. The recent estab

Washington, the steps taken in different
States for forest protection and the move

which began a few years since, are tan
gible evidences of the increasing interest

of need. He is the friend indeed and it
always pays well to stand In with him,

Summering in a rented cottage Is much
like staying: at home, only, of course, you
are not half as comfortable. But you at
any rate obtain some change of environ
ment. There you are away from the mad
ding crowd and the responsibilities that

You may go north, south, east or west
and find any amount of cozy little cot

is to pack your trunk and pilot your fam
ily there.
In taking a furnished house it is always

from their labor because, forsooth, each
day grows more and more tedious, ark-
Ing is just about the thing. There are any
number of places that are near enough
home so that they may travel back and

Life on an ark is the laziest of all out-
Ings. The people who can afford to own
them take their servants along to do
everything for them but eat, drink and
sleep. Time is too precious to even think
about any question that amounts to a hill

Mr. Vacation Man, which side do you

For you must go somewhere. Even in
old Bible days it -was supposed that ev
ery one would "commune with one's own
self and be still."
When you can't possibly decide what
you want to do or where you want to
go for a vacation, but are only certain of
one thing and that Is that your expenses
must be light, try a new scheme that
really Is not half bad. Make out a list
of the ways you might go and have a
rattling good time; â¢write each one on a
separate paper and toss them up in a
hat. Then when you draw ona gingerly

cidedly curiosity is a good thing to have

A frying pan, a coffee pot, one or two
etew pans and a few tin dishes are abso
lutely necessary, as Is also a knlfa and

question, and everybody agrees that it is
one of vital importance.
Beans, peas, dried fruits and crack

Everj-thing must be solid and tight, just
as snug as you can possibly get it. Do
not be afraid of the -weight, for when
things are piled just as high as they can
possibly be and yet stay in place, and
when you are inwardly "wondering if the
horse can stagger under the load, there is
room for a fellow or a girl on top of it
all.
Traveling that -vray means heaps of fun,
all new country and ouite a little work,
lor none of the conven.ences that make
modern camping such a joy can be car
ried along unless several horses are taken
aj mere pack animals.
The next most Arablike pick-up-your
bed-and-walk fashion is the wagon that
has been fitted up for such a trip. . The
size depends entirely upon the number of
people that are going. Two men can take
an ordinary buckboard and be fairly com
fortable and cozy. The tent is stowed
away under the seat, the sleeping bags
on top, and then a tiny cupboard can be
built on the space that is left in the back.
Partitions filled with this, that and the
other thing are as handy as can be, be
sides utilizing every square inch in the
wagon. A gasoline stove can be fastened
on the back, where it swings with the
Â¦water pall. Naturally guns are needed,
or they might be, at any rate, so they
can be strapped on the sides over the
wheels, and an ax ought to keep them
company, for it Is a mighty handy thing
to have about a camp at certain times.
Unless a wagon is long, a double-seated
affair, and built for that purpose, It is
not comfortable to sleep in, but now and
then you see one that tucks four people
away snugly after the berth fashion, but
not very much space is saved, as blan
kets, pillows, etc., are needed, and they
really take up more room than the bags.
Of Course camping In the regulation tent
is entirely different, as the tent is sta
tionary, while with tire wagon or pack
horso your bed is where your fancy places
it. Every day may see you far from your
last resting place. Sometimes the change
raay be for the better and now and then
for the worae, but at any rata the scenery
Is varied, the climate often changed and
the eyo satisfied.
Tenting Is really playing: at keeping
house, and not Infrequently It proves to
be very hard play, especially if there are
r.:any mouths to fill, for the average ap
petite Is Increased fully one-half by the
unusual amount of tramping and the
fresh air out-of-door life.
Tents can be bought that are floored
and that have pockets. all about the sides
for the various things that are forever
bobbins up and that havo a tendency to
keep under foot. There are divisions, too,
that make as many rooms as one wants
and that afford more privacy than one
large room, .
When camping is to be done on a large
scale load a wagon with a stove, table,
chairs and bedding. All this Is indispen
sable. If you are neat make sheets and
pillow slips of colored calico, a dark blue,
or, best of all, a mottled tan or brown.
White never does look that color five min
utes after it has been put on a bed spick

of delicious canned meats and fish that
fill the bill exactly. Soups and vegetables,

BY MRS. E. P. SCHELL.
THE advantage of the trump echo is
evident, as it is necessary for your
I partner to know exactly how many
trumps you hold and he need not
A go on with an unnecessary round
of trumps.
If partner calls or leads trumps, or by
his play shows four or more trumps, you
should echo, with four or more in hand.
And do this at your earliest opportunity.
The echo is usually a very simple thing,
but" at times it is not so easily accom
plished. â¢ Sometimes it has to be made
even if you sacrifice some strength.
If you" hold exactly four trumps, three
high cards and one small, you will los-j
a trick i? you attempt to echo. When
it is evident that loss will result from
making a sacrifice you should not echo.
In echoing to partner's lead of trumps,
you holding less, than four â and you do
not attempt to take the trickâ you play
your lowest card. If you hold more than
three ycu play the third best to the first
round and your fourth best or the lowest
if holding exactly four. If you have live
or more you still play third best, follow
with fourth best and your partner will
be able to place the small cards in your
hand and he will not continue the trump
lead, for exampleâ with 10, 7, 4, 3, or 10,
7. 4. 3, 2, you play the 4 to the first round
In each case and partner will often read
the echo- of strength before the echo id
really completed.
Now then, suppose that partner has
If you take 'a 'force and Qo riot* lead
trump, you of course show you have but
one trump; so that in this manner you
can show any number of trumps. A hand
where it is good play to refuse to trump
a winning card.
In response to partner's request for
trumps, you, holding ace and any number
of small cards, lead the ace. There are
times when your partner calls for trumps,
but jou arc not in to lead trumps; you
can show number of trumps by echoing
in plain suit, for exampleâ you have led
the ace of your suit and followed with
fourth, best, which falls to your oppo
nent s kingâ your partner has completed
his call for trumps. The opponent opens
ace and king of his suit. You have now
the opportunity of making the suit echo
by playing a higher and then a lower
card to show four or more trumps, but
holding less than four you play in the
usual way, for exampleâ holding the 5
and 4 of the suit you play the 5 and then
the 4, to show four or more trumps.
You can also echo in the manner in
which you take a force, if your partner
has called, and a suit is led of which you
are void, you can show the number of
trumps by the way you take the force.
For example, you are holding the 3 and
4. you trump with the 3 and lead the 4,
you show exactly 2. If you hold the 6. 4
and 3, you trump with the 3, and lead the
6, you show three or no more. Again, you
holding the C, 5, 4 and the 3, you trump
in with the 4, and lead the 3, you show
two more. Still again, if you hold five,
trump in with third best and lead fourth
best, retaining the fifth best, you will
then show your partner that you held
five originally.
the two in sequence and follow with the
highest.
Again, holding high trumps in sequence,
either one of which will win the trick,
you can show the exact number, of
trumps by the order in which you play
these high cards. Holding two honors in
sequenceâ ace, king, or king, ' queen, Â¦< in
answer to a signal, you desiring to show
four or more, you lead the lowest of the
sequence and return the highest, .but
holding less than four you lead the high
est of the sequence, following . with the
lower one of the sequence; but on part
ner's lead of trumps you, holding high
cards in sequence and four or more in
suit, should play - the highest of the
sequence and follow; with the lower one
in the sequence. For example: . Holding
ace, king and two ' small, you play ace
first, and follow with the king; but hold
ing less than four, with two honors in
sequence, you should play the lower of
called, and you hold â¢ less than four
trumps, you' should lead the highest; if
you hold the trick you should play down
âfor example, holding queen, 8 and 2,
play queen first, then the 8, then the 2,
it will show three exacily; but holding
four, the ace not in the combination, you
should lead the lowest, or the fourth best
of five or six. For example, holding
queen, 8, 6 and 2, the lead of the 2 and
followed with the 6 would show that
you have two cards above it; but If ycu
hold queen, 10, 8, C, 2 and you lead the
.6, then drop to the 2, it would show by
the fall of the cards and your own hold
ings t that your partner could hold three
more.

WHIST FOR THOSE WHO WILL PLAY A GOOD GAME.

â without the help of handkerchief, as done
by most magicians.
To perform this v trick we need a pre
pared card. After blowing out tho con
tents of an egg we stick the ogg shell to
- thf back of a card with a little wax and
show it to the audience (as pictured in a).
Lowering the right hand, which is hold
ing the card, with the, left hand, we hide
the card in the inside of the left hand (as
shown in b). Â¦ â¢
Thereby the egg has become separated
from the card and brought in the position
in which it will appear a moment 'later
(c). We slide the card int'o a pocket while
directing the attention of the audience to
the egg. Instead of the egg we can use
a small bunch of flowers, or anything
small enough to be covered by a card.
Egg and Card Trick.-*
The performer shows the . unprepared
Bide of the coin to the audience, and after
allowing them to examine the box places
the coin in it with the paper side on top. Â¦
When the box is opened the coin will ap
parently have disappeared.
A plain, small, round pill box is best for
this trick. Select a coin which fits exact
ly in the bpx and prepare "one side of it in
such a way that it resembles the bottom
of the box by pasting a piece of paper
similar to the inside of the box over one
side of the coin. Or a better plan would
be to paint the inside of ' the box black
and use black paper for the coin.

The Von Schellendorfs ' were the'"; first
people to tame and harness zebras. The
Baron himself had no idea \ihat this
could be done, for the zebra is reputed
the wildest of all wild s things. It was
done by leaving a young zebra two days
without food, and then letting him into
a kraal, where he could see donkeys eat
ing hay from, the hands of natives. In
two days he also would eat from their
hands, put down his head to 'be .'rubbed,'

his escape. Everywhere, as he seeks to
break the. line, men spring up, shouting
and brandishing sticks. The line of ani

turns back, and the long line follows

THE, SUNDAY CAEL..
The 3100 miles of railroad will be nar
row gauge! because it was decided some
years ago that a narrow gauge wa3 pref
erable throughout Spain. Madrid; about
2150 feet above the level of the sea, is the
center of the railroad system. The moun
tain heights between Madrid and the sea-,
ports impose steep grades, and in many
places -long detours, which with a gauge"
of five feet six Inches' and the consequent
'friction have made 'the operation- of
Spanish railroads very expensive. Tha
Spanish assert that their high transporta
tion charges are necessary on account of I
broad gauge railroads. All. the new con
cessions for construction have stipulated ,
that railroads shall be narrow gauge,
which, it 13 now certain, will be the fea
ture of future railroad building in Spain.
The ordinary trains run only fifteen, to
twenty miles an hour, and freight rates
are so high that it costs more to carry
goods by. rail from Saragossa to Barce
lona, 200 mllea, than to ship from Erg
land. It is not strange that under such
conditions t commercial development in
Spain is far inferior to that . of other
countries. Even at the seaports the Span
lards know nothing of the facilities which
other nations possess for transhipment
between cars and vessels, except at Bar
celona. Bilboa, Huelva and one or two
other places. :

It must be' remarked that summer fur
niture Is particularly built for the sum
mer man. It is he who enjoys gettinj
out upon the piazza at night and he who
loves to linger upon the roof while the
stars come out and shine for hira par
ticularly.
There is a frivolous statement to the ef
fect that one can judge a man and hla
wit by the way.he : conducts himself upon
a summer piazza. Not all men who sit in
â¢well furnished piazzas are entitled to the
honor of being called summer men but
only those who understand the arts of
summer.
Would you be a summer man? Then ask
yourself. these questions. Go over theia
alone and Judge for yourself of your own
fitness.
Suppose you were alone upon the piazza
In the evening with a pretty girl, sitting
together in the swing, -with star* up

Suppose she were sitting alone In the

one's feet may rest on top with ,case, or
in the sides, or in any manner that may
be agreeable, when one is fired with golf.
It is impossible to scratch this open
work footstool, for it has no. top and, as
for wearing out, warping, becoming, loppy,
or getting out of shape, this also' is : im
possible. It makes a'nice little stand for
books which can rest comfortably upon
Its lattice.
The roof swing, or the piazza swing, is
something that needs only to be" described
in order to fascinate.
It consists of a wicker or bamboo couch
built in such a way that It is alike at each
end. A little railing makes the back as
well as the head and the foot.
This couch is fitted out with grass cloth
cushions for "Seat and back. It is then
elevated by ropes until it swings free from,
the piazza. This makes a swing of It. r
There come piazza swings that answer
this description but the man who yearns
to make his own swing can- buy a' couch
and hane it all.
Chairs with wide arms, couches with,
little shelves In them, the dearest and
squarest little foot rests, all these are in
the new summer furniture in wide' variety
and. in great numbers.
There are couches that have a lifting
seat in which, there are stored croquet
balls, mallets, and garden ; implements.
And there are other couches so built that
you lift them entirely and place articles
underrfeath the couch, which is hollow. â¢
The -English courting- chair has found
Its way to the roof and into the aff ectlous .
of the summer man and girl. It Is made
of very heavy timber and its arms are
â¢wide and comforting.
In all the new piazza furniture there !Â¦
one thing to be noticed and that la Its
durability. It can be wet; It can be left
rain the cushions are lovely with their
delicate aroma.
The rugs in the new piazza room are
of the wood fiber kind, but of a new vari
ety. They are partly grass and, though
they are no longer green, they are pretty
and brown, and you feel that you can
walk upon them without injuring them!
As for a shower it is really as beneficial to
the rugs as to the grass pillows. 1
There are wonderful screen chairs In .
the modern piazzas. They have grass or
straw backs that are very high. One of
these chairs â one of the very latestâ has a
back of such height that it serves as a
screen. Turn your chair around and you
are shut away from the world.
The screen chair is a delightful thing
if one is afflicted with visitors at an in
opportune moment. Turn your chair
around and you are not at home. The
piazza is -vacant and only the chair back
stares at the visitor, the back which is
built like a screen.
There is another virtue about this
screen chair. It is built for two; and
when two sit in it, and turn around, they
are immediately alone. This Is the time
when the world forgetting and trie world
forgot Is particularly applicable.
If you want to make a screen chair, ba
sure that the back is sfx feet tall and/
the seat at least a .yard wideâ wide enough
for you and another. And have the seats
rather deep. You must have wide arms.
And the chair must present a substan
tial look as of one that feels its burden.
There is a glorified footstool that comes
this season and it Is one of those con
trivances that can be made at home. The ]
material if you are its maker, should "be
hard wood and the pattern Is openwork.
There Is no top to this stool, only up
rights, Joined by cross pieces, â¢ so that
THX3 rammer piazza Is a summer
joy.
Once It was a place of sun and.
doubt, of bugs and mosquitoes and
of discomfort
N'ow It Is the dwelling place 1 of
all that is. pretty and -delightf uL It â¢ is
the summer living spot, the place wkere
all repair at all times of day and at
most times of night. It 13 the cozy cor
ner IdeaJ; the spot without which there
can be no summer home and no summer
at all.
The city dweller has his piazza upon
the spot. HerÂ© he builds himself a spot,
shut out, perhaps, from the wide, wide
world by a screen or two, anchored as
roof screens should be. It is most likely
a' lathing, with matting drawn over it.
Perhaps his screens are of the heavy
portable sort. These are taken down at
night and laid fiat upon the roof. By
day and by moonlight they are lifted an*d
placed as comfort and the neighbors
suggest.
There are many new things about the
Bummer piazza that cne hearing about
them is disposed to wonder if a person
ever reaily knew what a piazza was be
fore.
The man who has owned a piazza other
eeasons has been accustomed to doing
many. things which he does not now do.
Ke has brought in the pillows at night.
He has done the same trick with the
rugs. ?
He has performed stunts with the fur
niture, moving it about bo that the rain
would not beat UDon it.
The tables he has cither drawn to the
Innermost corners or has covered with
canvas, and as for the couches and the
foot-stools, well, these have been so
scarce that he has not bothered himself
much about them.
Now the up-to-date cummer piazza Is
fitted out with furniture which stays put.
Its couch of bamboo Is wettable; and
the cushions that trim it so prettily and
â¢which are in all the colors of the rain
bow can be wet without injury. They,
are made of gTass and stuffed with grass.
Of course, as this is an age of scent,
tfce grass Is fragrant; and after a warm

all. The ceiling is hand-painted. The
furniture, which, like tha general design
of the rest of the car, Is imitated from
models of the Loui3 XV period, 13 all

Tho Belt as a Feature.
The belt has come into prominence as a
feature of tho dress-up grown. It is worn
with the handsomest dresses and partakes
of their elecance.
The feature of the belt, now and for all
time, Is and/ has been the bttckla. Cleopa
tra unquestionably wore exquisite belt
buckles, and perhaps tha Queen of Sheba
did the same. At all events, there are no
pictures too old to show traces of the belt
In one form or another, be it chain or cord
or the ancient band of stuff resembling
ribbon. ' ', ' >-Â¦ ; VfÂ»St
Upon the Princess the belt Is worn
rather high, in Josephine fashion, and it

An exceedingly pretty little belt iÂ» ona
seen with the dress costume. It Is worn
with any bodice. andi3 pulled low, but ia
quite Independent of waist and skirt,
which are joined together in their own
fashion and perhaps finished with their
own method of joining. Â¦
Then comes the little' Independent belt,
which la narrow and of exquisite finish.
One of these belts was in gray suede, not
over an inch wide. It was pulled very low
in front and the ends crossed under a very
handsome little buckle, in which sparkle-I
real gems. Such belts as this are really
very costly and are articles of jewelry as
well as of temporary beauty
It would b.e idle to try to mention the
many forms which the belt Is taking. Ono
of these t3 a series of cameos, joined with
tiny chains, the whole to be looped over a
ribbon, which Is fastened around the waist
and clasped in front.'
Here little women are at their best, for
they can wear these belts. It is the wo

a disadvantage in them.
For^the, fat woman, tho narrower tha
belt the better, and the blacker It Is tha

A very lovely dress skirt was In cameo
pink veiling, made with pin tucks run

They were very tiny and close together.
One involuntarily thought of cording
when one looked at It, yet it was really
softer than the cords would have been.
A hip, yoke trimmed this skirt and was
_iij the \ form of lace points set in at the
belt line and extending downward at each
side, while in the front and in the back

At dinners one sees the new colors. In
the daylight, by the garish sun, one hesi
tates about putting on the new tones, but
when the coft electric glow throws Its
radiance around thsn the colors are
made less pronounced and the tones that
would be too glaring in the day are made
becoming and desirable.
Glacier blue Is a blue that you can
Imagine. Not quite as cold as Ice biue,
nor as light. It Is still a blue that Is
steely and clear, a blue that takes cream
white to soften It and a blue that must be
used carefully.
Or the softening qualities of rose and
the delights of the arbutus and orchid
pinks. Even the watermelons that are
almost red, and the strawberries and
cherries that are very rod, are permis
sible so long as one gets that blessed
warming glow, that light that comes in
with the family of reds and goes out
with it.
The yellows are having an inning!
They are here In all their warmth, and
one sees the orange and the burnt orange
fading- Into the cool lights of the lemon
and moon yellows. Champagne, sau
terne and chartreuse yellow are the
rather startling titles . of three of the
new shades, and In the deeper tones one
sees the lovely daffodil and the yellow
rose, and the soft, pretty primrose and
the very delicate clear ambers.
Tan is enjoying a new popularity in
evening wear. It comes In a very admir
able peachy tone that, while warmer
than the cold tan, is not too pinkish' and
'jven the dull tans are worn with pink
to brighten them. â¢ -:
It takes one back a little to see the
dinner gowns In changeable gray taffeta
trimmed with peach colored satin; and It
certainly seems like meeting an old friend
to come across the light blue silk with
its up-to-date trimming of pink panne.
Pink and blue are reunited after many
years of separation,-, and rose and gray
are friends again. Blue and green go
courting on many, a gown, and the com
bination of purple and green is found
surapng the more daring 1 of the French
gowns and in such manner that - the
tones of both are very light.
The duennas are taking to the change
able Bilks, helped out with marvelous
trimmings of black lace, and white lace
cr lacÂ© In ecru. One em do a great deal
with a changeable Bilk, as our grand
mothers i discovered lone ago, and a
great deal Is' now being done with. It.
The Bcviral of the Handbag.
The silk handbag, is certainly revived
under the name of the wrist bag. It -Is
really a dinner ornament as well as a
street one,- and particularly la It to be
worn with full dress.
And' this Is a very pleasant arrange
ment , The pocket has disappeared utterly
from polite society, and for a lady to hunt
her pocket would be an unheard-of thing
these days, a sight not seen. .
. So the wrist bag comes at an opportune
moment. It holds the tiny handkerchief
which cannot be held In the lap during
dinner, and It holds any small necessity.
They say that in London It holds the snuff
box, but one must take that with its grain
of ealt. r
Ladles who remove the gloves at dinner
can slip them into the wrist bag, and with
the new gloves it looks as though their
removal were a necessity..
A custom introduced simultaneously in
Washington and London last winter
called for the slipping off the hands of
the gloves, which were then tucked into
the-Bleeve of the glove, leaving the arm
still covered.. This had never been re
ceived with favor before, but Mrs. Roose
velt did it, and Mrs.- Hay did It, and
Countess Cassini, who is so popular with
foreigners and natives, did It. Abroad,
Mrs. Paget, and no less a personage than
her gracious Majesty Queen Alexandra,
followed that custom, so there was less of
the peeling of the long dinner glove: .
It is quite the fashion to go to dinner
without gloves, but customs vary with
the town, and what is correct In one city
1b not viewed favorably In another and
one must watch one's neighbors and do as
one's neighbors do.
Dinner Gloves. .
The new dinner gloves have "decorations
upon them. The effort to keep them per- :
fectly plain and buttoned with tiny pearl
buttons at the wrist has partially failed.
At a nice dinner given a few', evenings
ago by Mrs. Clarence Mackay, Long Isl
and's pretty hostess, the guests wore
gloves with the backs incrusted with'em
broidery of the same .color as the glova
and others were stitched In a fancy de-\
sign. The lace trimmed wrists are not
many,,yet one does see the narrow rows
of Valenciennes decorating the long arms
of the shoulder gloves. Little tufts of rib
bon are pretty and the little silk rosette
like tufts sometimes introduced are also
becoming to the arm.
The fancy for wearing the- hat at dinner
is growing. It must be a picture hat and
there must be a general understanding
that the hat is to be worn. The head
dress dinner is responsible-. for this fad
and the idea of wearing the hat carries
with It such a picturesque suggestion. that'
society leaders hastened to take* It up.
The headdress dinner is easily- managed.
One wears one's dinner gowns and dresses
one's head historically. ' The ; Wllhelmlna
peaaant cap, all in white -lace with.
two little ruffles around the lower edge,
and with gold lace medallions at each
Bide, is charming, but the wearer should
be young and pretty.

The New Colors.
Do not be incredulous at the thought
that lace can differ so greatly in color, one
piece from another. There are pieces of
rare old lace that are as dark and as red
as old ivory, and others that are as white
as though bleached on the grass and
blued. Spun linen was never more snowy
than certain kinds of fldunce lace.
There are women who have neyer culti
vated a taste in lace andCwho find other
materials more economical and quite as
effective.
the finest lace in society, is a woman who
understands the art of the flounce trim
mings. She owns several deep lace
flounces, all of them valuable, and differ
ing from, each other In kind and color.
It is said that Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont,
who is certainly the possessor. of some of
There is a trick in the transformation
of a gown. It cannot be done with bows
of ribbon, nor can it be accomplished by
the putting on or the taking off of a
lace coat. But It can be brought about by
the wearing of a different lining or by the
application of floral panels or by the hasty
stitching on of a deep flounce of lace.
There is no denying the supremacy of
white when, one has not many gowns. In
a white dress, say of chiffon, if one can
risk the delicacy of this material, j or in
Bilk muslin, or In silk organdie, or .In mull,
or Bilk lawn, or all lace, or veiling; or
fancy gauze, or any other of the many
fabrics, one can make an excellent ap-i
pearance many times during the summer. 1

The skirt was finished Irt the very plain
est way with little lace ruffles, put on in a
graduated manner, rising ( toward the
back. The hips werÂ© snug and the skirt
fell away in a long and graceful sweep.
The new chou, it may be mentioned, has
multitudinous ends. It seems Â»as though
there were nothing but ends to it.r num
berless tiny ends of baby ribbon with,, a
knot tied in each, like a tiny rosette.
There are a few loops, but the feature
lies ia the many little ends. I
The New Chou.
This dinner costume was a dear little
creation in white silk organdie over a
cream colored taffeta. The waist was cut
with a neck shaped after the Marie Stuart
design. That is, rounded in the back and
pointed rather low in the; front. This
would admit of the wearing of a lace col
lar which could be simply laid around the
neck and fastened with a chou of baby
ribbon in front. !
A certain woman with grown-up daugh
ters declared against the cumbering- of her
summer trunks with so elaborate a cos
tume as would be required for a dinner
party. Finally Bhe relented and into the
trunk went a little toilet, which was a
clever compromise between the magnifi
cent dress required for a similar function
in winter and the ordinary summer gown.
The dinner gown occupies an important
place in the summer wardrobe. Try to get
along without it, if you be a woman of
any fashionable pretensions, and see how
woefully it will be missed. The shirt waist
has its mission and a broad and varied
one it Is. You can wear a hundred-dollar
shirt waist or a one-dollar one. But you
can hardly make either take the place of
the full dinner costume, such a one as you
will need to carry you with credit through
a semi-fashionable summer.
This panel should be all in roses, with
plenty of vines and the prettiest of foun
dation ujÂ»on which it can be worked in
chiffon. Lemon colored chiffon, with pale
roses and a few white ones, formed .the
outside skirt for the handsomest dinner
gown that ever graced a New York ma
hogany. It fell over a drop skirt of lemon
colored taffeta.
The figured materials are not confined to
those that come ready made. The newest
thing is the floral panel, which Is em
broidered at one side of trie skirt in such
a manner that it points toward the top.
It begins at the head of the deep flounce
and extends upward In a wide panel
shape, which speedily comes to a point.
Skirt Trimmings.
The buckle sets are more and more nu
merous and one now sees as many as fif
teen buckles all adorning one pretty flow
ered muslin. There are tiny buckles upon
each wrist puff; there are buckles at the
top of the puff where it disappears under
a tight upper part. There is a buckle at
each side of the stock, or one at front and
at back. There are two at the belt, one in
front and one behind, while all the rest of
the buckles are used in catching- up the
lace that makes a flounce for the lower
part of the skirt, or are used in the ribbon
treatment, which is part and parcel- of
every gown.
The buckle is a feature of the very new
sash. The knot Is tied through it; or the
whole bow Is drawn through the buckle
until the middle knot of the silk is clasped
into it. The bigger the buckle the better.
Take a cream colored muslin, flowered
with pink button roses, and let it be made
up over a changeable rose colored taffeta.
With it you will want to wear a new sash,
a sash of rose colored satin ribbon, very
wide, and drawn through a great gold
buckle at the back of the belt, with ends
that hang down to the very hem of the
tiress.
The dinner muslins, flowered with those
marvelous roses, that are either too
email for the rose kingdom or much too
large for it, are seen everywhere, yet
one does not tire of them.
Again, as you look across pongee and
get its glisten, you are assured that It is
a dinner fabric and you rush away to
xratch its sheen with velvet of the same
hue, for the making of straps and turn
over cuffs; and for great collar points
over which you will place lace, for a dln
rer gown.
Pongee is an odd material. One day
you think It a rain cloth and buy It for
a rough weather wear." Again you see In
it a traveling material and purchase It
for the train or the yacht. The bride

THE DINNER
TABLEno_textthousand pairs of shoes were brought by the Dixie, and
stockings galore for the women, to say nothing of hats,
caps and bright calico dresses.
The simple natives, delighted with their new posses
sions, paraded the streets for the admiration of all be
holders. The shoes, being of no use (the natives of thesa
tropical islands have never known the luxury of shoes),
were frequently seen strung about their necks to excite fcfca
envy of less fortunate townsmen. -J
In some instances, however, big, black, becorned feet,
spread by years of unrestraint, were squeezed into the new
shoes. Women were arrayed in high-topped tan shoes and
clocked stockings, and the infinite variety of millinery seen
would have creatsd a sensation equally as well on tha
Bowery as on Broadway, while the men, in new shirts with
colored stripes, flaming red neckties and gaudy ribbons
around hats of latest mode, excited the admiration of the
village belles and the astonishment of all beholders. Solo
mon in all his glory was not arrayed like these.
After the work of discharging cargo was well under
way Captain Berry of the Dixie, senior officer in command
of the American vessels in port, ordered the gunboat Poto
mac to convey the entire company of scientists, writers
and photographers to St. Pierre, about twelve miles up the
western coast. Eager were all to catch the first daylight
view of the ruined city.
We steamed along a green and fertile shore, fringed
with mango trees, cocoanut and cabbage palms and
palmettos. The hills were verdant with tropic shrubbery,
but within a mile or two of the stricken city all livins
vegetation ceased abruptly, and the parched, withered and
ash-covered area which Pelee's hot blast had devastated
lay before us. The line of demarcation between the living
and the parched hills waÂ» well defined. On one hand were
green-clad hills reaching far back from the shore, and
then, but a few yards to the north and east, was Pelee's
path of destructionâa dismal, ash-hued stretch of beach
and hill slopes, with the burned and uprooted trunks of
trees obtruding from the heaps as far as the eye could
reach; blackened and blasted cliff rocks, jutted and beetled
over the sea. The odor of burned wood and ashes and
finally of decaying human flesh came from ashore as we
drew near the silent city. The glaring noonday sun bear
down pitilessly on the gray waste of rock3 and ashei
. Only a few straggling parties of natives could be seen, and
they were engaged in ghastly work about the funeral
pyres. Vultures hovered and soared over the scene of de
struction, while all about was the awful stillness of death.
AVe had drawn quite near the ruined city before wÂ»
were. aware of It, toe nowhere could be discerned the least
semblance of a town.
"What do you think of it?" asked Captain McConnlck
of the Potomac, pointing to the gray waste, which de
scribed a crescent round the roadsteadâ In front the sea,
then a level" beach reaching back for a hundred yards;
then a gradual ascent that soon rose precipitously into
cliffs. We could see* nothing but a dreary waste of sea
shore, slope, hills and cliffs, all ash and rock covered.
There was no sign of a house intact; no semblance oCi a
street. At various points there appeared to be fairly <g!iu
regulated rowa of half-demolished stone walls. This was
all to show that it had ever been a cityâ the metropolis of
Martiniqueâ one of the chief marts of the Windward Isl
ands; the site of schools of learning, of libraries and rare
botanical gardens. Beautiful St. Pierre, famed through
out 'the West Indies as the garden city of the Caribbean
Sea, the home of a light-hearted and joyous people was
laid In waste at the feet of Peleeâ Pelee, whom the Cariba
had worshiped as their "Fire God," and who would some
day, tradition said, rise in his wrath and punish the
wicked. And so it came to pass, as the Caribs had proph
esied. But the hot breath of Pelee visited its wTath upon
saint and sinner alike. They perished Ilka the host of
Sennacherib:
For the Ansel of Death spread his winja en tha blast.
And breathed on the thousand-two-scorÂ» as he passed.
And the eyes of the stricken -waxed deadly and chill *
And the hearts but once heaved, then forever srew 'still.
The general 'aspect of the ruined city, as viewed from
the sea, reminds one of nothing so much as the Aztec ruins
of New Mexico and Arizona. The adobe (mud-colored) and
half-demolished walls, in regular and Irregular rows as
cending gradually from the sea and then rising abruptly
to the cliffs, were for all the world like the ruins of tha
Aztec cliff dwellers.
In vain we locked for streets, but all was chaos. St
Pierre was literally razed to the ground by the eruption
of the day before. Even the cathedral towtfr, which, since
the eruption of May S. had stood by the sea, a grim and
solitary sentinel, with its clock hands pointing significantly
to the hour of eight, had fallen in the- crash of yesterday.
Our party was divided into two boatloads, and befora
showing off from the Potomac Captain Berry arose In his
gig and admonished. the party that at the first blast of
the Potomac's siren all were to hurry to their respective
boats, for this was the prearranged signal of danger
threatening from Pelee. He also warned us not to give
offense to the French authorities by carrying away any
relic that might possibly be considered as "loot."
The boats touched at a point near the cathedral and
the two parties divided into smaller companies.
Naval and army officers, scientists, writers and photog
raphers armed with their cameras finally stood on the
beach, irresolute, not knowing which way to go There
seemed no choice of route over a monotonous waste of
ashes and rocks, with no street to guide us. no house <jr
prominent object of any kind to^be used as a mark A few
days before the streets had been fairly well denned w'th
many walls standing as far as the second story, "where
blue enameled iron signs bore the names of the various
streets, but the second eruption had razed all walls to thf
ground and obliterated all marks. The city was indw'
totally annihilated. We stumbled and fell over rocks ani'
ash heaps, picking our way as best we could to avÂ«J*Â§
quagmires and the stench of corpses. Sometimes we we'a

human corpses was sickening; the troDical sun beat mer"
cilessly down on the recks; the grewsome sight of skulls
grinning at us from between bowlders, cf limbs and hand'*
obtruding from the mud, as if in mute appeal was most
horrifying. . *
On every side lay strewn the wreckage of once happy
homes. There were bedsteads of iron, stoves nott^rv
kitchen pots and pans, and all things non-combustible We

barked on the United States relief ship Dixie, bound
for Martinique and St. Vincent islands. Wo sailed
on May 14.
Early on the morning: of the Boventh day, after the 4
o'clock watch^had been called, the bridge officer of the
Dixie announced that Martinique Island was sighted and
all hands were soon out on the spar deck. Off the port
bow, almost directly ahead, was a lurid glow in the sky
that rose and fell in fitful spasms. The light was from
Pelee's crater, and soon the vague outlines of Martinique
Island were distinguished through the haze. The site of
the destroyed city was dotted with funeral pyres, for, even
in the dead hour of right, the work of exhuming and bury
ing- bodies lying near the surface was being conducted un
der the direction of the French troops. At this hour we
could see little of St. Pierre itself. As we steamed past
the stricken city the scene on the Dixie's deck was most
impressive and almost weird. The full moon looked down
upon a deckload of white-robed figures, for most of the
party had been called hastily from their bunks and were
yet in their night dress. Captain, officers and crew, the
delegation of scientists and the press representatives lined
the port rail from stem to stern. Two white-robed priests,
the Dixie's chaplains, stood with uncovered heads. Then,
when the sun's edge peeped over the water and cast her
golden rays over tne expanse of blue sea, Pelee was seen
towering loftily and majestically above the Martinique hills.
Huge billows of steam were rolling from her crater, hov
ered over the mountain top and spasmodically ascended in
plant columns. When we entered the harbor of Fort de
France there were five warships riding at anchor â the
"United States cruiser Cincinnati and gunboat Potomac, the
French cruiser Suchet, British cruiser Pallas and the
Dutch cruiser Koningen Regentes, the latter vessel having
been dispatched by Queen Wilhelmina on an order written
from her sickbed. The French battleship La Tage after
ward steamed in from New Orleans.
The customary salute of twenty-one guns and a reply
from the fort awoke the natives and the harbor was soon
filled with a fleet of small boats rowe'd by negro men,
women and boys. They were a most excited and voluble
lot of boatmen and chattered like monkeys as each tried
to outstrip his neighbor and bear the first news of the
eecond eruption, which had occurred only the day before
Two of the Dixie's passengers, former residents of St
Pierre, and who iost relatives and considerable property
In the disaster, conversed rapidly with the natives In
French. \ olley and volley of questions and answers were
fired back and forth over the rail.
The natives, scarcely recovered from their fright of
yesterday, were not able to tell a coherent story, but from
the log of the Potomac we gathered the first details of the
bombardment of Fort de France the day before by rocks
thrown from Pelee's crater, nine miles distant on an, air
line. \
On Monday, May IS. the Potomac and British cruiser
Indefatigable steamed from Fort de France to St. Pierre
Â¦with the intention of recovering the bodies of the American
and British Consuls, but Pelee was steaming furiously,
botn from the crater and new fissures nearer the town
s.nd shore. Smoke and ashes alternated with steam erup
tions and ominous rumblings came from the great ash
covered mountain. Landing parties were compelled to flee
but by. persistent attempts and heroic exertion finally re
moved the body to the deck of the Potomac. It was car
ried to Fort de France, where impressive funeral services
â¢were held, all Americans, including the naval officers be
ins in attendance. ' '.
According to the Potomac's log, "between 5 and 5:30
the next morning (Tuesday. May 21) a giant column of jet
black smoke shot into the air from the crater of Pelee and
arose in a column about five hundred meters in altitude
flashes of lightning continually playing through it The
great column then spread like a flower on its stalk the
outer edge showing white and gold where It was lighted
by the rays of the rising sun. A perceptible cold wave
Â«vas immediately felt at Fort de France. Then came a
fhower of ashes and gravel-like stones, followed by vol
canic dust that covered the decks of all vessels in the
harbor.
"The men of the Cincinnati had been giving the vessel
a new coat of white paint the day before. The ashes and
dust settled on the fresh paint, and for the first time since
the close of the Spanish-American war the Cincinnati was
dressed in her war color. Crowds of panic-stricken people
eoon fringed the shore and ran about in a distracted man
ner. They seized all of the available boats and soon a
great fleet of small craft, filled with excited men women
and children, surrounded the warships and merchantmen
begging piteously to be taken aboard. The shower of rock
having by this time almost subsided, and the requests be
ing contrary to regulations, they were denied permission
The natives returned ashore, where they made hasty prep
arations for flight to the neighboring islands of St. Lucia
Dommica and Guadeloupe. The small coastwise tugs wer#
crowded to their utmost capacity."
Those who did not take flight soon resumed their usual
avocations. I\.ot without misgivings, however, for thev re

bells of the Catholic cathedral and churches in Fort d>Â»
France tolled mournfully for the 30,000 dead and buried
under the ashes at St. Pierre. These candle-lighted edi
fices, draped in black, were filled with old men and women
who kneeled on the stone flagging and with bowed heads
prayod fervently for their salvation and for the souls of
the dead at St. Pierre. Mass was celebrated several times
Â«ach day in all of the churches. The melancholy tolls of
bells and weird funeral processions, with mourners all
afoot, bearing rude coffins on their shoulders and carrying i
lighted candles, made a ghastly picture
The quaint old French town would have been all too
somber but for the brilliant and picturesque dress of the
women and the animated street scenes as they hurried to
a ? d ,,l ro ' en * a " ed in their marketing, with brilliant folds
of silk or cotton stufT deftly twined and tucked into grace-,
ful turbans about their raven-black hair, skirts looped up
well in front and fastened at the belt, exposing their bare
feet and ankles, while a train flowed behind and trailed on
the ground. Bright plaid mantles of kerchiefs were thrown
carelessly over their shoulders. These women are as
gracefully erect as Indians, for their custom of carrvlne
water jars or bundles balanced on their heads has elven
them an erect carriage. Bright red and canary are tnÂ«
predominating tones, though there were to be seen ail the
colors of the rainbow. They hurried through the quaint
eld streets, narrow and Illy paved, only stopping now and
then to exchange friendly greetings and to cast fearful
looks toward the volcano. Young damsels were seen hur
rying to church in a body, escorted by a delegation of
Bisters, who counted their beads as they passed alone â¢
Old men and women now and then knelt in the street a i

pressed a crucifix to their lips and mumbled prayers to the

rified populace, attributing the eruptions to the introduc

and pleaded that the excitement and confusion following
the first eruption and conflicting reports from various
quarters misled him. He said: â¢ "The Dixie brings â¢ 900,000
rations, the relief committee in each State appointed by
President Roosevelt will possibly send as much more, and
the powers of. Europe have relief ships en route. Thera
must be two or three million rations in sight â enough to
feed and clothe all the people of Martinique for months,
while there are only 6000 who actually need help."
But it is an ill wind that blows no good. The furious
blast from Pelee, though fraught with such direful re
sults, was a God-send to the natives of Martiniaue. No
sooner had the first lighters discharged their loads than
the supplies were distributed by the Mayoris orders. One

SUNDAY CALL REPRESENTATIVEThe town was found full to overflowing with refugees,
who were being supplied with food and clothing 1 from a
storehouse. Two big hospital tent3 were full or injured,
two physicians and a corps of nurses being in attendance.
The residents of the town and refugees from surrounding'
towns were in a state of mind bordering on consternation
and talked excitedly in groups or ran about the streets in
a distracted manner. Women were in hysterics and chil
dren crying. Kings Hill, which was almost totally de
stroyed, nothing being left but a wilderness of ashes and
uprooted trees, was the next stopping place, about five
miles above Georgetown. At this point the immense Por
ter sugar factory was destroyed and all hands perished.
All dwelling houses were razed to the ground. The party
concluded to push still farther on toward the base of La
Soufriere, although warned by frightened men and women
that it would be a hazardous undertaking. Between Kings
Hill and Overland several river beds were crossed, now
perfectly dry. At Overland, about two miles from Kings
Hill and lying at the base of Soufriere, a terrible scene of
destruction and desolation was witnessed. The houses
were razed to the ground, and the few that were not com
pletely destroyed had been abandoned. The volcano
rumbled and roared, and great clouds of steam continued
to pour from the crater.
On our return trip we saw several negro women run
ning down the ash- strewn hills. They beckoned wildly to
us, as if in warning. A little farther on wo discovered the
cause of their alarm. The dry river beds that wa had
crossed on our way up were filled with swiftly flowing hot
mud or ashes of a thick consistency. In color it was, as
the French people would express it, like cafe au laitâ
that Is to say. Coffee with milk in it. It was hot and
steaming and not more than ankle deep on the horses'
legs. They waded through the stuff without apparent in
jury. The natives, however, believed that these streams
were but forerunners of an avalanche of mud and ran into
Kings Hill and all the way to Georgetown, crying for thÂ«
people to save themselves. Their fears were groundless,
however, for upon arrival at Kingstown late in the after-
Having viewed the havoc wrought on the western coast
of St. Vincent, our party set out for Georgetown, on the
Windward side, about twenty-two miles distant from
Kingstown. Some were in covered wagons, others horse
back.
Professors Hovey and Russell believe there should ba

lished -to give warning of impending' disturbances. They
could be conducted In a manner similar to our signal and
weather bureau service, with telegraphic communication
between them.
"Nothing entirely new," he replied. "The horizontal
plane of fire from Pelee was unusual, though not new. A
similar eruption occurred in Japan in 1886. But the hori
zontal plane of fire at Pelee la, to my mind, the most in
teresting feature of the eruption. The popular notion is
that St. Pierre lay at the base of Pelee and was buried in
a shower of ashes and rock, when, as a matter of fact,
the city occupied a strip of shore land and high cliffs not
at Pelee's base, but five or six miles distant. The fire path
from Pelee took a horizontal direction, like the discharge
from a gun mounted horizontally. To make it clearer to
the lay mind, I will compare it with the wind and flam**
from an immense 'blowpipe.* The matter thrown upward
by Pelee rose to a very great altitude, and, being of con
siderable specific gravity, descended with the velocity ot
lightning, especially as it neared the crater again. Here
it encountered the matter ascending with great velocity
from the crater, and the result was a tremendous draft
at the junction. This blew the flame in a horizontal direc
tion, and St. Pierre and the ships in the roadstead were
directly in its path. The heat from a blowpipe, so every
body knows, is intense. In this case it was intense enough
to melt glass in St. Pierre and Immediately destroyed all
forms of li/e in its path." v,-Â«
"Does history record any volcano eruption more- vio
lent than these?" . ,
"Yes, more violent," he replied, "but scarcely more
disastrous, when we calculate the loss of human life. ThÂ»
eruption of Krakatoa In the Straits of Sumatra in 1883 was
not so disastrous in the loss of life, for there was no thick
ly" settled communitv or large city adjacent, but the force
of the explosion was felt for hundreds of miles. Huge
tidal waves were rolled up tha.t destroyed life in islands of
Java, Borneo and Sumatra."
"Is it true that the sea depth In St. Pierre roadstead
was increased by 3000 feet?"
"No," said Professor Jaggar. "Captain Berry assures
me that soundings made at St. Pierre show no material
increase In depth. You might also correct the popular be
lief that Pelee has been reduced two-thirds in height. As
far aa discernible with the eye, there has been no reduc
tion in her heicht.

several weeks and make a careful observation and

two towns, and the avalanche of ashes and lava has flowed
down the mountain slope to the sea on both sides, cutting:
the island completely in two parts, the northern part, oc
cupied chiefly by-Carib Indians, being almost entirely de
vastated. Chateau Belair escaped miraculously, for only
a few yards from this town the path of fury of the volcano
was easily seen by us from the Wear's deck. The Una of
demarcation between living and parched vegetation was
as clearly defined as if it had been predetermined and ex
ecuted by design. North of. Chateau Belair we steamed
In very close to the shore. Giant clouds of steam were
being thrown from Soufriere to immense height, comlns
out in continuous huge rolls and billows and reaching sky
ward in columns of great altitude. Ominous rumblings,
sounding like surf beating against cliffs, were first heard
indistinctly and then broke forth in an alarming roar, con
tinuous, like Niagara, but at times punctuated with loud
crashes like thunder reverberating through the mountains.
When a particularly heavy roar and crash came and Sou
friere sent up great billows and columns of steam moun
tain high the commander of the Wear hastily gave orders
to put about and the vessel steamed rapidly seaward. Then
when the fury of the volcano had somewhat abated the
little steamer again headed for shore and poked her nose
close up against tjie beach. As far as the eye could reach
landward nothing could be observed but the ash-covered
beach and mountains, cragged, blackened and blasted
rocks of the cliff juttlngsand beetling over the sea. Be
tween the sea and Soufriere were numerous fissures, from
which steam poured in great rolls.
The volcano continued to make spasmodic outbreaks,
accompanied by the ominous roaring, and after each of
them the little steamer would turn about and retreat sea
ward, then cautiously feel her way near shore again. Tha
heavy rain soon set in, spoiling further observation, and
the Wear reluctantly steamed homeward.
The scientists had apparently been greatly interested
in what they saw of Soufriere, consulted with each other
and made copious notes. Inasmuch as three weeks had
Intervened since the first eruption and the volcano was yÂ«t
dangerously active, they could not with accuracy predict
what might follow in the future. I asked Professor Jaggar
if he expected serious trouble from either Soufriere or
Pelee. He said: "In view of the fact that there havo
been several recurrent eruptions since the first ones by
both Pelee and Soufriere. what may happen is beyond
human conjecture and altogether beyond the realms of
science to predict. Evidently the energy stored in these
great subterranean storehouses has not been exhausted,
and, to my mind, the bubbles from the sea off St. Lucia, on
a direct line between Pelee and Soufriere, are most signifi
cant. Then, too, the first eruption of Soufriere wa3 on May
7,> followed only cne day later by Pelee. Clearly there Is a
close and dangerous sympathy between the two, separated
as they are by a distance of more than one hundred miles.
Under these conditions, would it not be futile to hazard a
prediction of what the morrow will bring forth?"
"Have you formed, any conclusion as to the cause of
these eruDtions?"
"Certainly no definite conclusion in advance of critical
examinations ashore and careful analyses of the ejected
matter. I will say, however, that the popular theory that
sea water entered earth fissures and generated steam in
the bowels of these volcanoes is not altogether an unten
able one. In fact, it is most plausible."
"Is there any novel feature accompanying these erup
tions that make them unique- in the history of the world's
seismic disturbances?"
"Nor are the views of the scientists calculated to quiet these
fears. With wise looks and ominous shakings of heads
they will only say, ."No man knoweth what a day may
bring forth." Plainly enough they believe that, in view of
repeated heavy eruptions from both Pelee and Soufriere,
separated by intervals of weeks, together with the fact
that both volcanoes are yet smoking and steaming furi
ously, throwing ashes, smoke and steam from new fissures,
there may be recurrent explosions more far-reaching than
any that have yet occurred. Professors Hovey, Jaggar
and Russell considered the sea bubbles most significant.
In advance of more critical examinations and analyses
ashore, they were reluctant about making any. definite
. prognosis. Professor Hovey, however, said frankly, though
eententiously, "Pelee is not done yet." Â¦ -,-
The views of Professor Jaggar of Harvard, however,*
expressed in non-technical terms, will doubtless best appeal
to popular understanding.
Aboard the steamer Wear, while cruising along the
west coast of St. Vincent Island, near the volcano Sou
friere, I had an interesting talk with him. In the party
were also Professors Russell of Michigan University, Pro
fessor E. O. Hovey of the Museum of Natural History.
New York, and Professor Borchgrevink, an Arctic ex
plorer of note and member of the Royal Geographical So
ciety. The Wear is the little vessel that was caught in a
hurricane of hot ashes and rQck near Chateau Belair and
fought her way through blinding smoke to Fort de France.
Chateau Belair is about two hours* sail from Kings
towiv on the west coast of St. Vincent, and is immediately
opposite Georgetown, on the east or Windward coast. The
volcano Soufriere is situated about midway between the

laden with pottery and kitchen utensils; anotner was
armed with a rusty, lire-eaten sword. The "poor box" of
the cathedral was found, and from it were taken many
French coins of small value. Many enameled signs bear
ing The names of streets were brought to the boat.
The party were necessarily cautious about where they
stepped for fear of falling into quagmires or wells. A New
York Herald representative witn his arms full of kitchen
utensils fell into a barrel of molasses nearly buried in the
mud and ashes. He was rescued by his associates, with
out, however, releasing his hold on his precious burden.
We saw the ruins of United States Consul Prentls'
house, from which his "body was removed yesterday. (The
bodies of. his wife and daughters are still in the ashes.)
The ruins of the v^Jeon Theater and of the principal cares
were visited, but they were only a shapeless mass of rock
and asnes and were identified merely by their relative
locations.
Out of the wreck and ruin, surrounded on all sides by
. hideous spectacles, the Dixie's party endeavored to keep
up its spirits by persistent and labored attempts at humorâ
of a prim sort. They were literally whistling through a
graveyard. Some fun was indulged in at the expense of
Professor Borcligreviuk. the Arctic explorer, who, before
leaving the vessel, proudly exhibited a pair of asbestos
shoes cf his own manufacture, with which he intended to
scale the precipitous heights of old Pelee, but, to his dis
may, upon arriving at St. Pieire he discovered that a pair
of lubber bents would have been of more service, for we
sank ankle and knee deep in the gray mud. The corre
spondents before leaving the Dixie had organized a mutual
protection societyâ a sort of accident and casualty insur
ance associationâ and it was facetiously suggested that
the organization be known as the "Frenzied Sons of Pe
lee."
% After an hour ashore the Potomac's siren was sounded
for departure and all hurried to the beach. As the little
punboat drew away from shore the crowd at the rail took
their last looK at St. Pierre, for the Martiniquans have de
cided to abandon it as a town site. The dead and buried
will be allowed to repose peacefully where they are.
But ruined St. Pierre will forever remain as one of the
wonders of the worldâ ro less than Pompeii, and, like that
city, will never rise, phenix-like, from her ashes.
As the stricken town faded into a vague outline above
the sea the words of Lord Macaulay recurred to the
writer. In commenting on the -vast changes and ravaged
wrought by time and the elements, he said eloquently:
"Perchance, some day, a traveler in London may stand
upon a broken strand of London bridge and view the ruins
of J-t. Paul's."
During the Dixie's stay at Fort de France the people
were greatly alarmed. The harbor was still the rendezvous
of a numerous fleet of vessels, warships and merchant
men, awaiting the developments that a day might brin<
forth. The second heavy eruption, sudden and altogether
unexpected, so far-reaching in its effect that vessels in
this harbor were caught in a shower of small rocks and
ashes, made all s-kippers cautious. The United States
cruiser Cincinnati rode at anchor, but had a slip on her
cable, ready to cut loose and put to sea at a moment's
warning. All vessels had a full head of steam on. The
Dutch cruiser Koningcn Regcntes, sent by Wiihelmina on
an order written from her sickbed, had been anchored a
considerable distar.ee from shore, but would not brave the
dangers of Fort de France harbor at night. She crulsea
outside at a safe distance and finally left the dangerous
vicinity altogether and steamed northward. The French
cruisers Suchct and La Tage were awaiting orders, al
though there was nothing whatever for them to do there.
All of St. Pierre's victims were buried in a common grave.
The few survivors from the country and villages adjacent
to Pelee had been taken to places of refuge and had
been provided with food and clothing by the United States
relief ship Dixie. Hie people of Fort de France were un
easy, however, and. acting upon the recommendation of
the Martinique authorities, "the French Government de
cided to hold its four ships there, ready to transport thp
refugees from the island to St. Lucia and Domfnica. shouM

the neighboring islands free from apprehension. At Cas

end, in fact, as far north as Porto Rico, there was mani
fested a fear that the entire Caribbean chain of islands,
both the Windward and Leeward groups, may become in
volved in the cataclysm. All are plainly of volcanic origin,
the scientists say, having been thrown up from the sea by
gigantic seismic upheavals, and, lying comparatively close
together as they do, they describe a series of stepping
etones> that define the boundary of the Caribbean Sea.
After two days at Fort de France the Dixie proceeded
to St. Vinefcnt and discharged one-half of her cargo at
Kingstown. The British cruiser Indefatigable was in the
harbor. Spasmodic and violent eruptions continued to
occur at intervals of every few days, while there was a
continuous flow of lava, stram an^ ashes from Soufriere
orator. The occasional fall of pumicestone or scoria la
Kingstown's streets from the crater, fifteen miles distant,
caused a feeling of uneasiness that could not be quieted.
It is but natural that the neighboring islands of St.
Lucia, Dominica an'i Guadeloupe, not far distant, should In
a degree share the general alarm, for the detonation from
heavy eruptions at Pelee arfl Soufriere have been heard
et these points nnd various springs in the mountains have
greatly increased their temperatures. Bubbles have risen
from the sea at a point directly on a line between Pelee
and Soufriere. and were plainly to be seen "by the com
mandant of the British garrison on St. Lucia in using his
rangefinders. This, in the opinion of Professor T. A. Jag
gar of Harvard University, clearly shows a close associa
. tion and sympathy between the two volcanoes, and he be
lieves they are located on the same great submarine and
subterranean n>sur--. In view of the fact that they are
separated by more than one hundred 'miles and that there
have b<on submarine disturbances at a point midway be
tween them, it is but natural that there should be appre
hension throughout all of the islands adjacent, but that
the people of remote Porto Rico should have felt alarm
is surprising. Passengers on steamships arriving from the
Island report that gorgeous sunset.- and rise in temperature
of some of the springs in the mountains have convinced
the Porto Hicans that these are sympathetic phenomena
and have made some of them so uneasy that^they have
taken passage for she States. The superstitious Porto
Rico natives have for months believed confidently in a
prediction madf In a 1 ! old Spanish almanac that the world
would come to an c:id Â«jn May 22. On that evening the sun
set was more gorgeous than u^ual. The sky where it met
the sea was of a bright, golden hue. alternated with
patches of deep blue, and radiating from the orb of the
tun, iust Finking in the water, were streaks of flaming
red. Terror-stricken, the superstitious natives awaited th<j
end. At Ponce they paraded the streets in a state of ex

men and women knelt in the streets and prayed fervently
for their salvation. The failure of the prediction made by
a false prophet <1H not altogether allay their apprehen

THE. SUKBAT CAM
Continued on Page Fourteen.At Georgetown we were told of some harrowing inci
dents of the first great eruption. Victor Sutherland was
killed in his shop in the Carlb country and it remained
closed for three days. When the door was opened on May
11 eighty-seven bodies, badly decomposed, were found. In
some instances corpses were found in the same postures in
which they were when death came. The manager of one
of the plantations was discovered sitting with his pipe
uplifted, as If in the act of smoking; women were found
in their chairs with garments in their laps and hands,
which they had been sewing. Others had fallen at their
Â¦washtubs, with the garments still clutched in their hands.
Some were found on the kitchen floor, where they had
been preparing the midday meal. After the holocaust the
saost eloquent pen could not describe the devastation. One
vast, dreary wilderness, strewn with corpses, greeted the
eye in all directions. Wallibou River was a solid bed of
cinders. The scene all along the roads was terribly ap
palling â worse than the horrors of war. Women with little
children huddled to their breasts lay indiscriminately along
the route. The corpses of men and of animals were scat
tered about promiscuously and in hideous confusion. At
Waterloo the dead bodies were so numerous and so closely
packed together that they could scarcely be counted. In
a laborer's house the wing of the hut had to be broken
to get out the dead.
The eruption of Soufriere appears to have been of even
greater violence than that of Pelee. Ashes filled the air
at Barbadoes, ninety miles to the east, darkening the sky
at midday, while in the island of Trinidad, about 150 miles
couth, the light of the sun was dimmed, detonations like
cannonading were hecrd, and the people of Port of Spain
thought that the Venezuelan gunboats had engaged the
rebel steamer Ban Righ in battle. The steamer Louisi
anian, at a great distance from St. Vincent, had her decks
covered with ashes and steamed through an atmosphere
that suggested the heat from an oven.
It is a singular facf* that, notwithstanding the small
area of St. Vincent Island, the earthquakes preceding the
eruption were not generally felt, while at Chateau" Belair
they were almost incessant. On May 7 there were sixty
Bhocks in four hours, one of which demolished several
dwelling houses.
An abyss about four hundred feet deep and two hun
dred feet in width, which existed between Langley Park
and Rabacca, about five miles from Soufriere, was com
pletely filled up with lava.
The estimated area of cultivated land destroyed ap
proximates sixteen square miles, and the loss of life on
St. Vincent Island is from three to five thousand. Three
thousand families were made homeless.
The sight of old men and women trudging into Kings
town with their packs on their backs was pitiful. Some
had walked twenty or thirty miles, hungry and footsore.
The captain of the Dixie found that while the few sur
vivors at Martinique were plentifully supplied with pro
visiors and clcthinsj, the condition in St. Vincent was much
Â¦worse, and lighters were soon busy unloading the balance
cf tho Dixie's cargo. /
soon a telephone message stated that the flow had not
been considerable.

they would lie 'hurled under blankets of this dust, and

The excursionists who returned from the picnic to
Morne Pelee indulged in- a bit of satire at the expense of
America's chief product. They declared, according to Lea

America." . ' ; . Â¦â¢ Â¦
~ As Romain was esteemed a reputable and veracious
citizen by his townsmen, this may be taken as a reliable
description of the appearance of the crater^ just previous
to the eruption.
The issue of Les Colonies of Monday, May 5, in its ac
count of the picnic, says that great clouds of steam from
the crater prevented a good view, but that the party
trudged over the mountain with guides and returned home
in the evening, rather disappointed with what they had
seen. While on'the mountain they were told what Jules
Romain,' a property holder of Morne Pavillat, had seen at
Pelee's crater as early as Aprillo. On that day he decided
to leave the neighborhood, having observed light emitted
from the crater for several successive evenings. He re
solved to have one last look into the crater, however, and
did so. He compared the. crater with a huge "bblong
caldron. In which seethed and bubbled a black mixture,
in appearance not unlike the contents of the big kettles
in the sugar factories. The black mass, as it bubbled, rose
and fell, sometimes rising in the crater till it overflowed
and ran down the mountain slides in rivulets.
phrases of a circus advertisement:
"We call attention to the fact that next Sunday, May
4, a grand excursion to Morne Pelee will take place, or
ganized and conducted by the members of the Gymnastic
and Shooting Society. Those who have never witnessed
this magnificent panorama, offered to the eye of the as
tonished spectator atÂ»an altitude of 1300 meters; those who
have never seen the yawning chasm from which there have
escaped these last few days those thick clouds of smoke
and steam, which have not failed to cause terror to
of the more timid of our people, should profit by this grand
opportunity and 1 have their names enrolled at the office
of the society by this evening at the latest. The excur
sionists will meet at 3:30 a. m. sharp on Sunday at Marche
du Fort, and will then proceed to Riviere Blanche and to
Isnard, where, guides will be found. Those who do not
care to bring their luncheon with them may be so bounti

Under the date of May 2 (five days before the first
eruption) Les Colonies printed a display advertisement an
nouncing a gay picnic party to Pelee. Under the general
caption of "Echoes" and the sub-head "Toward Mont Pe

pretty face will be sadly, disfigured. As we were leaving
the captain' of the French cruiser Suchet called to inquire
after her health and brought her a' box of bonbons. Cap

we. will take them on deck to see the volcano.' Then the
captain called for all to come on deck and see a 'real vol
cano' in eruption. We all went out. By this time the
Roraima had ventured into the roadstead and /lay at
anchor. The volcano was smoking and steaming, and
ashes floating in the air settled over the deck. I was
afraid they would spoil the nice white dresses of the chil
dren, and said I would take them below. Suddenly there
was a great upheaval of the mountain top; a great mass
shot into the sky. The air around the ship became blind
ing with dust. *A hot wave shot past us and nearly car
ried us off our feet. As we ran to our stateroom and closed
the door after us we heard the captain cry, 'I fear the
ship is lost.' The air in our stateroom was by this time
intensely hot, blistered our faces and hands, and we
gasped for breath.- I thrust Rita behind me and tried to
shield her face with my skirts. I held the smallest child
in my right arm. Mrs. Stokes, who was badly burned,
cried hysterically as she realized she was dying. She fell
on her knees and prayed, and exacted from me a promise
to always care for the children: - As her cries ceased the
steamer gave a great lurch. The little boy, who had been
leaning against the door, fell out into the passageway.
With Rita and the baby I made my way out. The scenes
I witnessed are too awful and harrowing to relate. The
clothing of the men was burning; the deck was covered
with hot ashes and rocks. Men lay writhing In agony on
the deck. How we all lived through the terrible ordeal T
will never know. The baby in" my arms was dead, the
doctor told me. I returned for the boy. His body was
found in the passageway and that of Mrs. Stokes in the
stateroom. In the afternoon about 3 o'clock we saw a
steamer approaching us cautiously. It was the Suchet, and
she carried us to Fort de France. Every one has been
very kind to us in the hospital, and when we are able we
will sail for Barbadoes."
"What shall we say to your friends in New York,
Rita?" we asked the child.
"Just tell Mamie McCarthy about it.' she\said simply.
"Mamie McCarthy is her little playmate in Brooklyn,"
the nurse explained.
His story was told to the Bishop at Mo me Rouge from
which it appears that the convict's escape from death was
due to his incarceration in an interior cell, situated under
ground. He had been an obstreperous prisoner and as a
punishment. he was locked in the "dungeon." 'According
to his story, he heird the detonations from Pelee and the
excitement In the cells overhead; felt some of the stifling
heat and breathed the gas, but not enough to asphyxiate
him. He suffered for four days, meanwhile trying to at
tract attention by ioud cries, but the situation of the in

help scarcely penetrated. They were finally heard by a
rescuing party, however, and he was believed to be in a
dying condition. Being furnished with food and water, he
revived and was taken to the estate of Ferdinand Clerc.

and by the deprivation of food and water, and his recovery

of St. Pierre's citizens, scoffing at danger, were in the
throes of political dissension. It was stated by Les Colonies
of May 7 that when supplies reaching St. Pierre for the
relief of some of th<? victims of the Guerin sugar factory's
destruction were unloaded from lighters hungry crowds
besieged the soldiers in charge of the distribution but no
one was supplied unless he had a meal ticket signed by the
Mayor. Les Colonies protested against this attempt to
make political capital for the Mayor's candidate for the
Legislature (on the radical socialist ticket), M. Percin as a
disgrace and outrage, and announced that on the following
day (May 8) the Colonial Alliance party would meet to
examine the books of the relief fund treasurer. But on
that fateful day the Mayor, his candidate for the Legisla
ture, the entire radical socialist party and the opposition
Colonial Alliance slept in a common grave.
The story of the miraculous escape of a negro confined
in prison at St. Pierre appears to be well founded. His
name is Raoul Sartout, alias Plensin. He was convicted of
petty larceny and was serving his sentence when the emo
tion occurred. Of the population of 30,000 souls he Is tha
sole survivor.
"We were en route to Barbadoes to live in future with
Mrs. Stokes' sister, Mrs. J. E. Croney," said Clara King,
"for Mr. Stokes, who has been employed as bookkeeper
by Mahler Brothers at Sixth avenue and Thirty-flrst street,
New York, had died of pneumonia about three weeks be

lyn. On the Roraima were Mrs. Stokes, Rita, a little boy
of four and a half years and a girl of three. We ap
proached St. Pierre about 6 a. m. on May 8, but as the vol
cano was smoking and steaming and ashes filled the air
and covered the deck the captain decided to cruise for a
while In open sea, as he considered it unwise to anchor.
Mrs. Stokes said to me: 'Clara, it is just four weeks since
X.v. Stokes died. Wash and dress the children nicely, and
The wee girl gratefully received a bunch of flowers and
gazed wistfully at them when placed In a bowl by her cot.
She feebly muttered her thanks, and in reply Â»to a few
questions faintly murmured that Rita was her name and
said she was nine years of age. Then, as the nurse, Clara
King, an intelligent mulatto woman, gave us a vivid ac
count of the agonizing scenes on the Roraima and told
pathetically of the death of Rita's mother, brother and
sister, the little sufferer lay in her cot with a sad light
in her blue eyes, for she was not too young to realize her
terrible affliction and bereavement. i
In company with Father Reaney, one of the Dixie's
chaplains, I called at the monastery at Fort de France
and we obtained data concerning the Catholic institutions
destroyed in St. Pierre, viz., five parish churches and twen
ty-live hospitals. In all, twenty-four priests perished,
thiiteen belonging to the Society of the Holy Ghost and
eleven secular priests. Seventy-two sisters lost their Hve3,
of which thirty-three were of St. Joseph's Sisterhood,
twenty-eight of St. Paul's de Chartres and eleven of the
Society of the Deliverance (natives).
One of the most pathetic features of the terrible dis
aster was the injury and bereavement of little Margarita
Stokes of Brooklyn. She lies on a cot in the hospital of
St. Louise, Fort de P'rance. It is situated on a beautiful
eminence overlooking the town and sea. We were con
ducted by the sisters to a large ward, wherein were at
least fifty patients, most of them victims of terrible burns.
Two rows of beds were ranged along the sides of the long
room. The occupants were all negroes â all but one â and
from the coverlets of that little cot peered the wistful face
of a child â a face once pretty, but now frightfully scarred
and distorted. By her side, in the same cot, lay her nurse,
Clara King, who seems to have been burned only on her
limbs. These two are the survivors of the Stokes family.
The mother perished on the Roraima in St. Pierre road
stead. , -\ ,.'â¢
Curiously enough, the well-to-do English residents of
Kingstown, especially the merchants, did not welcome
America's lavish contributions, for, they said,' the enor
â¢mous' importation ->f food and clothing could not fail to
injure the trade of Kingstown merchants; and when told
that Congress would likely increase the relief appropria
tion to a half-million dollars and that President Roose
velt's committee of two in each State of the Union would
probably swell the relief fund to a million, they shook
their heads ominously and predicted "bad( times."
"It is not the very poor who suffer most by these dis
asters," said a Kingstown banker, "but the middle class,
the merchants."

men are now proportionally the 'inore
emotional and effeminate of the sexes.
Perhaps a better reason, however, Is
found in the explanation that whereas the
dramatic possibilities of the old time mas
ternteces lay entirely between the heroine
and the heavy villain, with the devotion
of the hero thrown in simply as a reward
of virtue for. the heroine, the discovery
jected lover, perhaps because he can por
tray such a character more poetically,
more convincingly, more pathetically and
yet, withal, with more manly qualities
than any other actor on the stage.
His earliest success as the dejected lover
was as Kerchival West in "Shenandoah."
After this came Mr. Owen in "Liberty
Hall." More recently cam* his triumph
as Eric Ternple in "Heartsease," which
only his genius as a lover saved from ut
ter failure at its initial performance, and
raised to wonderful success after the play
had been partly rewritten under his di
rection.
fThen followed his remarkable portrayal
of Sydney Carton, the man who loves and
loses in "The Only Way"; the English
officer who loves and loses in "Brother
Officers" and the husband who loves and
loses and dies for his love in "The Tree
of Knowledge." In "The Adventures of
Lady Ursula" he was the man who, hav
ing been the victim of an unhappy love
. affair, detests all women, and besides his
successes in "Heartsease." "The Only
Way," ."Trelawny of the Wells," etc., he
will have a fine part as Sir Harry Milan
or, who is thrown overOby a flirt.
In contrast to these roles, however, he
will have excellent opportunity to display
his talents as lovers of different sorts in
the two successes of the present Empire
Theater season. "The Wilderness" and
"The Twin Sister," and also In Sydney
Grundy's costume pla.v "Frocks and
Reasons galore have been advanced to
explain this strange condition of affairs.
Some have it that as this is the age of the
athletic girl women have become less hys
terical and more worldly wise than they
were only a generation ago; that, in brief.
Just look Â«over the long list of recent
big successes and you'll be surprised to
note how many have their central theme
revolving round the man who loves and
loses, or, if he wins, it is by little more
than the author's dramatic license. But
whether he wins or loses it is his heart
sick longings, his hopes and fears, his bit
ter disappointments that now bring the
tears rather than the soul suffering of the
stage heroine. Indeed, to preserve the
law of proportion the heroine has become
almost blithe and gay as the hero has
sunk in the scale of sadness. Curiously,
too, the list of male stars has grown with
the growing popularity of the dejected
lover, while the list of actresses who have
triumphantly attained that proud emi
nence has sunk in the same ratio.

have changed. Now it is the man who
loves and loses who is the popular mati
nee idol, for the passion for dejected stage
loversâ the more dejected the betterâ has
grown swiftly apace.
Drew, however, is only one of the many
stage favorites who express such a fond
ness for the role of the man who loves
and loses, though in this line Henry Miller,
who has just completed the first week
of his long summer engagement at the
Columbia, stands high above all the
others. His part in "Trelawny of the
A good example of this was recently
shown us by John Drew as the man who
loves and loses in "The Second in Com
mand." In this play there were, more
properly two men with an apparently
hopeless love and the author completely
overshadowed everything else in the piece
to maintain the tensity of their wavering
hopes. It was quite a masterpiece in
contrasts of the triumph of the lover who
loses over the lover who wins. That is
the second big success that Drew has had
of this sort and he admits himself that
he likes such roles best.- ;-.V ';
In the new scheme of modern psyco

heart that is laid bare and dissected of
every emotion for the edification of a

the hero is no longer taken as a matter
of course, but that instead men do love

-which latter, by the way, calls attention
to the fact that Margaret Anglin, of all
the women of the stage who have recent
ly attained to the dignity of a star, has
won her greatest success as the woman
who loves and loses. In "The Wilderness"
and "The Twin Sisters'/^she has two very
strong roles, while we all know what a
thrilling personation was her acting of
the name part in "Mrs. Dane's Defense"
at the Columbia last season.
Another actor who has won no small
measure of his notable success as a star
for his impersonation of the dejected
lover is James Neil, at the California
Theater. Among the plays that have
demonstrated -his ability in this direction
are "Captain Swift," who commits suicide*
for the woman he loves; "The Social
Highwayman," "Captain Letterblair.**
"Barbara Freltsche," "Under the Red
Robe" and "A Bachelor's Romance."
As exceptions to the growing pre-em
inence of the man who loves and loses
are dainty little Maude Fealy at the
Grand Opera-house and Florence Roberts
at the Alcazar. Both of them, however,
have gained title and fame for I them
selves in the theatrical profession more
for their acting of women who love and
lose than for any other roles they play.
Note Florence Roberts' present success
in "Zaza," and before that her display of
talent in "Sapho" and "Camille," both
roles in which the heroine loves and loses.
Maude Fealy, by the Fame token, has
created the biggest sensation in her whole
career, which has been an exceptionally
brilliant one, in the role of Juliet. In

in and Was waiting in the reception-room.
Nor did they. guess when there was a
timid knock at the study door and a wee
maid slipped through the curtains and
into the arms opened toward her, lisping
"Mamma sent you vthese."
"Ah, they are the first of the. season,

gave him new, wholesome impulses and
eased his* mind in regard to the suffering
he has brought upon others. Mr. Mills
goes upon the theory that the world is
a vast gymnasium for the development of
moral -muscle, and it is a not half -bad
doctrine to preach, even to a man in Jail.
Then there was a woman to be seen who
had herself wrought up to the point of
thinking she wanted a divorce from her
husband, and who needed only to be
shown that she had made a mistake Jn'
living only to be loved and not to do the

people there are who like to share their.

listening ear and a sympathetic word.
Old, young and middle-aged they come,
each with a" trouble that seems.vital; and

gETNG a preacher Is not half bad
if you can be a preacher and not
have to depend on donation parties
and stray Invitations to dinner for
. a. living.
If Benjamin Fay Mills ever had to de
pend upon that sort of thing he has out
grown it, just as he has outgrown certain
creeds and church forms. Now he gets
some goodly thousands a year for his ser
vices, and no one who h&s tagged at his
heels for a day could deny that he earns
them.
Of course, Benjamin Fay. Mills spends
less time on his knees and more at his
desk than most men who wear iong-tailed
coats and white ties; but that is because
his religion contains a strong flavor of
everyday ethics and a smattering of so
cial science, economics and other wfiole
some ingredients that have to do with the
world, the flesh and the devil and their
,-ways. . Â¦
pvery day with him is a busy day.
On Sunday there is less of variety. It Is
grew and'he" was called to Xlameda for
an .afternoon service, and to San Fran
cisco In the evening, and as he began to
put Into execution some ideas of what ">
the modern church should be, he found
that one man was not bier enough to go
round if he- was to be get-at-able -at. all
hours of the" day and night by all sorts
conditions â¢ of people with all kind3
of axes to grind and grievances to unload.
So he moved back to the very edge of the
Piedmont hills, where he, could be half :
in town, half in the country; where from
his study windows he could- haveifor an
outlook on one side his town "garden, : on
the other a\ stretch of green fields, a lake,
the farther hills and in the distance East
Oakland and Alameda,' Here he is, close .
to, the " nature v that he loves- and -far
enough away to, sort out his visitors.
. After breakfast there is the mailâ and
such mail. Letters from good people, who
weep and pray over this man because he
does not think as they, do; letters pages
long and fathoms deep from people whosa
jWheels have slipped. Â£. cog; letters from
visionary' founders of strange sects and t
occult orders, 1 who want him to join them; *
letters from men and women, from whom
old faiths are slipping and .who want
friendly, sympathetic counsel; letters of
fering a last chance to get in | on i tha
ground floor of a sure-thing scheme: let
ters, some of them that never get beyond
the secretary, and others that have in-".
Btant attention; letters sweet and helpful
<o a man whose business it is to do for
others; letters stupid, silly and inane; oh,
jes, and bills.
No wonder the: desk of . Ben jamin Fay Â¦
Mills looks like a magnified mouse nest.
No wonder* the pigeon holes look as if
they would/ burst their wooden sides.
v After an hour . with his , secretary Mr.
Mills is ready for a breathing spelland
every morning at -this time he goes with
his wife for a stroll out in the fields or by
1 the edge of the lake. So much a part of
one soul are these two t^iat at this" hour
the man plans aloud as if he were think
ing to himself, or if the lecture he- Is
writing is far enough along he talks it
over and gets suggestions and advice.
Then it is time for study. Perhaps Mr.
Mills has carried with him an umbrella,
books and a writing pad. If so, when he
Is left alone, he stretches full length
among the grass and wild flowers to read
and think and scribble down thoughts
that are worth saving.
The smooth green lawn at the edge of
his own garden is another favorite place
for study; and still another is a corner
of the upper balcony where, with an um
brella stuck -in the front of hia waistcoat
and his feet on the window sill, he is the
picture of comfort, safe â¢ from intrusion.
Until noon he must not be interrupted
save for urgent reason. This every mem
ber of the household," down to the .tiniest
tot, knows and only one of Mr. Mills' as
sistants or Bome one with an important
mission can break the rule. In this event
a gong is sounded that can be heard out
Â¦ in the field or on the roof. In answer
down* goes the umbrella and the man
comes from his books to make arrange
ments with some one to lecture before
the Unity Club, to offer consolation to
tome one who is facing a keen sorrow,
or to greet an old friend from a distance
who is leaving town that afternoon.
When the creative mood -is on, Mr.
Mills needs the whole* house. He tramps
up and down his study, wanders upstairs
and down, and perhaps into the garden.
. The physical exertion seems to aid men
tal parturition. He can never tell where
a thought will be born; and as he paces
the flopr he carries a notebook in his
' hand ( to be ready when it comes.
r*Â»13iS.*SK>c"ket iÂ«talway3 . of cards so
that wherever he is when he has a hap
py thought he' can book it. It is a com
mon thing to see Mr. Mills tumble off hia
Â¦wheel in the middle of a busy thorough
fare, or ride up against a fence by the
rcadslde, take out a card and make a
note of something that has come into hia
head as he pedals along.
These notes in time find their way to
a certain drawer of his desk. Mr. Mills
has a sort of progressive lecture-writing
system all his own. When he decides on
a topic or a line of thought, down it goes
on a slip and into the lower right-hand
drawer. â¢
By and by some of these begin to grow.
Just a hint of something more, a reference,
a.quotation or an incident that serves to
illustrate a point, each, perhaps, jotted
down en a separate scrap of paper. When
they reach this stage, they go into the
upper right-hand drawer, though many
never get past the first. .
Then when one is selected and put into
some kind of shape and worked upon am/
thought upon during a period of striding
up and down the study floor, it is ad
vanced to the lower left-hand drawer.
This drawer is -kept' reasonably full, , for
often when Mr. Mills is .working at top
speed on one lecture he is brought up
with a jerk by a thought presenting itself
that belongs to another subject, and he
goes into drawer, number two, matches up
the thoughts and works on the other one
awhile. His mind isn't a nice, orderly
one that, grinds away like a hand organ
with a. single tune. ' -: '''*.-' \
v When the sermon is complete it is pro
moted to the top drawer to await an oc
casion that may or may not come. Per
haps just as it is finished ' a subject of.
current interest presents itself, is worked
out at, once and crowds the other aside
,eo that it never seems to be the right;
thing, at the right time.
At noon there is a' -wedding at ; the
church, and this means an hour and a
half or two out of the middle of the day.
Other days it is a funeral and that takes
all afternoon. But this is, where a pastor
gets right into the lives of his people, and.
Â¦with all the work he has in connection
with three congregations, Mr. Mills is
loath to leave the pastoral duties to hia
assistant.
"I like to go to funerals," he declares,
?'and I like to have people come to me
with their perplexities. That is a part of
my business. ' I believe in the \ eternal
good; I believe in the right; I do not fear
anything in the present or the hereafter;
and when I can carry that spirit into
other lives I like to do It. Only now and
then the gloom of others settles down
I upon me like a miasma and I have to
fight to shake it off."
After the wedding, home again; and as
on days when he is at home for luncheon,
the next quarter of an hour is spent in the
garden, cutting roses r>r strolling along
the paths with the two -little curly-heads
for. company. \ Of a Sunday morning, too,
there are always a few minutes spent in
the garden before church, for the place is
soothing and . restful and coaxes t good
thoughts. ;
. And now comes the secret of the stay
ing qualities of Benjamin Fay Mill 3.
Every day., for the first hour of the aft
ernoon he goes to bed. None of your,put
tlng on" a dressing sack, and lounging In
half rhear ted f fashion on a couch, but
blinds drawn, undressed j and to bed and
to sleep. And by this Mr. Mills claims he
gains an extra day every day.
After, the rest-hour,. visits. Not thÂ© reg

custom that the death of the sovereign

Edward 'is the first sovereign whose suc

before his accession, and apart from any
political' prejudices, he wishes' to 'feel that
the House of Commons has. been elected
by the, people under his rule, according to
all precedent. So strongly has thisreport

addressed happened to be'nobody as re

who is the fifteenth Duke of that name,
the title dating ' from 1546, was very
wroth. He went home And wrote a let
ter, saying he regretted his sovereign saw
fit to disregard him so publicly. Tha
King's secretary answered the letter, say

Inevitably result in the defeat of all leg

conclusion that if any considerable num

determination to vote with the Demo

fcass the House.
The critical point will come upon the
acceptance of the House bill with its
amendment for the removal of the differ

sugar Republicans are all protectionists,
and there has been from the beginning a
division as to the expediency of adopting

duty. This opposition found evidence in

decision to stand by the House bill as

The present plans of the Senatorial sup

Cuba was the one topic of discussion at
both ends cf the avenue to-day, but the
most important conference was that held
around Senator Hanna's breakfast table.
The most distinguished guest was Pres
ident Roosevelt himself. He came over
informally to talk over the situation and
the probable effect of the executive mes
sage. Other guests at the breakfast were
Secretary of War Root and Postmaster
General Payne. The subject of Cuba and
the plan of campaign were thoroughly
discussed, and Senator Hanna was able
to report that the message had a good
effect on Congress. The keynote of the
conference, which lasted nearly two
hours, was to force the fighting until vic
tory is won. Senator Hanna will not be
able to give personal attention to the fight
as he left for Cleveland to-night to attend
his daughter's wedding and will not re
turn until next Thursday.

NEW YORK. June 14.â Sir Wilfrid Laurler.
the Premier of Canada, and Lady Laurier. who
arrived htre yesterday from Ottawa, soiled to
day for England on the Etruria, to attend the
coronation of King Edward.
No papers were found on the dead man,
but his description tallies with that of
one of the members of the "Bill" Smith
gang, who goes by many aliases. A Cor
oner's jury exonerated the officers.
Officer Giles, who has the reputation of
a "bad" man on the side of the law, went
after the desperado. Instead of recros'sing
the line the latter fled toward a ranch on
the American side. Giles caught up with
him, but found that the outlaw had a
riiie. while- the officer had only a six
shooter. After exchanging a few shots
Giles* retreated to Naco, where he was
joined by an officer named Job.nson.
They procured rifles, made a detour and
intercepted the bandit in a lonely spot.
He refused to surrender, but started to
pump bullets thick and fast at both offi
cers. They escaped Injury, and the bandit
was shot dead after seven shots had been
exchanged. The last bullet had stuck In
the bandit's rifle.
TXTCSON, Ariz., June 14.â A fugitive
from justice, who had taken refuge in
Sonora and who. is supposed to have been
a member of the notorious "Bill" Smith
gang of outlaws, crossed the line at Naco
en Thursday and was killed In a battle
with two officers near that place. He
crossed the line near the outskirts of
Naco and went to a house in a remote
section of town, where he attempted to
rcb a woman who. came to the door in
answer to his knock. She succeeded in
giving an alarm, and her husband, who
was near by, came to her assistance with
a rifle. The outlaw made his escape and
the officers were notified. . â¢

The Yaquis are said to be fleeing toward
the south and it is feared that they will
break into the Yaqui country, where they
would 1 be.jolned by many Indians- who
have not* yet taken up arms.. V General
Torres has ordered the troops under Her
nandez to leave as soon as possible for
the Yaqui River to' prevent any such
move on the part "of the Indians.
General Hernandez was given an ova
tion by the people of Hermosillo when he
entered that city with his victorious
troops and many prisoners. He was es
corted- into' Hermosillo ' by -the reserves,
who were organized to' protect the city
in case of emergency. General Hernandez
and his men, who number about 800, will
remain in Hermosillo two or three days to
recuperate, when they. will leave for the
Yaqui River country, having been ordered
to that section by General Torres.:
Â¦TUCSON, .Aria., Juno 14.â The Yaqul
braves who escaped from the recent
crushing defeats administered by the
forces . of General Torres are fleeing
through. the almost inaccessible passes of
the Mazatan Mountains, in order, if pos
sible, to avoid another conflict until they
can collect their demoralized forces and
obtain a new . supply of arms and am
munition. A detachment of 1000 men from
the army of Torres is pursuing, them, but
the Yaquis are very cautious "after the
disaster in Uvalama Canyon and it is
doubtful whether' the Mexicans will bo
able to again entrap them before they
are ready to engage in battle. On the
other hand, it is feared in some quarters
that the Yaquis will - ambush the com
paratively small force pursuing them.

Scanlan penniless, the trio picked him
up and threw him Into Tracked River.
After a hard struggle Scanlan managed
to reach the bank nearly dead. The hobos
again attacked him, one striking- the old
man on the Â¦ jaw with a rock, another
kicking him, breaking: several ribs and
knocking out some of his teeth.
Constable Harvey and his brother gave

Benjamin Williams was held for trial
for murder and without a minute's delay
the officers started back to the Redding
jail with him.
Williams was secretly taken back to
De la Mar to-day for his preliminary ex
amination. He reached there at noon, in
charge of officers. No sooner had the ex
amination been commenced than the word
was passed around and 200' men gathered.
Constable H. F. Williams, father-in-law
of the murdered man, begged them to let
the law take its course. Had he shown a
desire to have quick justice or had there
been a leader or two, a lynching would
have been probable.
REDDING, June U.â The town of De la
Mar, at Bully Hill, has been excited to
day over the fresh prospect of a lynching.
Benjamin Williams shot and killed Deputy
Constable Charles Cummins last week
without the slightest provocation! 'Wil

an.
The rebels had no less than twenty
deces of ordnance raining round shot,
hells and combustible missiles into the
ity. A breach had been made In the city
vails, and had it not been for the brav
ry of an American trader and e. couple
if missionaries the city would have been
ushed and the inhabitants massacred.
"he trader, who witnessed the bombard
nent and thought that this particular
>art of the wall would not stand the in
:essant tire, posted about forty men with
Killing oil on the terraces of the wall,
ind when the rebels attempted to rush
he place this burning oil was dashed
lown upon them.
During the bombardment the rebels
ained a thick shower of flaming arrows,
ipped with the most inflammable matter,
nto the city, and these, combined with
.he "stinkpots," caused some fires. The
:onflagrations, however, were quickly ex
inguished and the damage resulting from
hem did not amount to more than $10,000.
The bombardment lasted more than
hree hours, and in that time upward of
i00 of the inhabitants were kiiled or
.vounded. The rebels retired before day
ight to the hill beyond Nanning, whence
hey started an investment of the treaty

ast advices were sent from the besieged

The prefect at Nanning sent out a num
ber of courk-rs to Viceroy Iao Mu praying
for reinforcements, but few of these goi

So far none of the disturbances had
made themselves apparent at the summit
of the cone, though no one has yet
reached the top to peer down into the
crater. Geological parties that have ex
amined the crater declare that the upper
most stratum of lava which covers the
surrounding country has been deposited
there within 200 years. Nervous people
have claimed in recent years that they
could hear strange rumblings. The re
port of the stock owners who have gone
to the scene will be anxiously awaited.
One man, who owns valuable land ad
jacent to the mountain, offered it for sale
at a bargain this week for the first time.
Responsible mountaineers now report
that all the springs of "Bumpus' Hell"
have suddenly . turned boiling hot and
that steam issues from theni and through
cracks in the lava in such volumes as to
form a thin cloud. Beyond doubt fuel
has been added to the ancient furnace
within Mount Lassen.
The summit of Lassen is a peak which
on more than one side is so nearly sheer
as to be inaccessible. A mile and a half
below the summit a plateau, varying in
width from 200 yards to a mile, extends
clear around the peak. The surface of
this is extremely rough and broken. The
volcanic rock is shifted into curious piles
and the whole plateau abounds in springs
and in caverns, many of which have be
come lakes. The remarkable thing about
these springs is that, while some are. very
cold and mineralized, others, but a few
yards distant, are boiling hot.
On the south extreme of the plateau is
a region called "Bumpus' Hell." It is
full of springs, some of which are so hot
that they have constantly emitted steam.
Most of these springs;- however, have
flowed with cold water.
REDDING, June 14.â Redding*s popula
tion is fearful of an eruption of Mount
Lassen, the ancient volcanic cone which
stands sixty miles to the southeast. To
day it was learned definitely that there
is some disturbance within the crater
which, for nearly two centuries, has re
mained inactive. Springs and crevices on
the south side of Lassen are emitting vol
umes of steam, which give the impression
to the approaching climber that the
mountain is sending up a cloud of smoke.
A party of men, who have sheep ranges
and a summer home near the base of the
mountain, has gone to the scene to make
an investigation and see if their portable
property needs to ba moved out of dan
ger's path.

Irsures Love and a Happy Home for
All. '
How any man may quickly cure himself after
years of suffering from sexual weakness, lost
vitality, night losses, varicocele, etc., and en-
large small, weak organs to full size and vigor.
Simply send your name and address to Dr.
Knapp Medical Co., 1373* Hull building, Detroit,
Mich., and they will gladly send the free re-
ceipt with full directions so any man- may
easily cure himself at borne. Tbis Is certainly
a most generous offer, and the following ex-
tracts taken from their daily mall show what
men think of their generosity: ' . â¢ '
â¢'Dear Sirs: Please accept my sincere thanks
for yours of recent date. I have given your
treatment a thorough test and the benefit has
been extraordinary. It has completely braced
me up. Â¦ I am Just as vigorous as when a boy
and you cannot realize how happy I am." .. '
"Dear Sirs: Your method worked beauti-
fully. Results were exactly what I needed.
Strength and vigor liave completely returned
and enlargement Is entirely satisfactory."
â¢'Dear Sirs: Yours was received and I had
no trouble In making use of the receipt as di-
rected, and can truthfully say it Is a -boon I to
weak men. I am greatly improved in size,
strength and vigor."

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
Starmtg and Staging.
At the start in a loÂ«g race, the advant-
age often appears to be with an outsider.:
But the race is won not in starting but
in staying. The .quality which wins is;
staying power. It is so in the race of
life. Staying
power wins, and egj
as a rule the best ;T V f*\ | W
stayer is the man \\^ Â£*'' jl
with the best n^^O^JL-^---;*
stomach. All
physical strength fiiliH llg^
is derived from tljJilllrw
food which is llipsiB
properly digested W^!^i
and. assimilated. ' i MBi' '
When the food Â«b HiIm
eaten \s only part-
ly digested and
assimilated there SÂ»<9=^ |jfÂ»
is a. loss of nutri-
tion which means \ . * Wf .
*& loss of strength ; - W
and the general M
result is' 'physical 0
break-down.
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery-
gives strength and staying power, be-
cause it cures diseases of the stomach
and other organs of digestion and nutri-
! tion. It enables the perfect digestion
i and assimilation of the food eatep,' and
so strengthens the body naturally by the
nutrition derived from food.
T Â«I was troubled xvitli indigestion for about
two years," writes V/m. Bowker. Esq., of Julia-
etta, Latah Co., Idaho." "I tried different doc-
tors and remedies but to no avail, until I wrote
to you and you told me what to do. I suffered
Â¦with a pain in ray stomach and left side and
thought that it would kill me. I am glad
to write this and let you know that I am all
right. I can do my work now without pain and
I don't have that tired feeling that 1 used to
have. Five bottles of Dr. Picrce's Golden Med-
ical Discovery and two vials of his 'Pleasant
Tcllets' cured me." ' . ,
Accept no substitute for Golden Med-
ical Discovery. There. is nothing "just
as good" for diseases of the stomach,
blood and lungs. â¢
Dr. Pierce's Pellets are easy and pheas-
ant to take. A most effective laxative. . '.
VIGOROUS AT 82
YEARS OF AGL
Gilbert N. Hay, of Utica, Says Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey Kseps
Him Vigorous and Strong: at the Age of 82.
Â§Up to a few years ago I was an invalid
and scarcely knew what it was to be
weli for twenty-four hours. I had grown
thin and could r.ot sleep until my doctor
prescribed Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey.
Since I have started to take your whis-
) key I have been perfectly strong and
/ veil and have eained thirty pounds. It
not only acts as a stimulant and tonic
for me, but it aids my digestion and
makes my blood circulate faster, and it
keeps me from catching cold. I will
take Duffy's Malt "Whiskey as long_ aa
â¢ i i (j I live, and it will be my only medicine;.

Uses Herpicide Successfully in Treat-
ing Sycosis of the Beard.
He says: "I recently treated a case of
eycosls (similar to barber's itch) of the
lower Up with Newbro's Herpicide. There
was an extensive loss of beard with in-
flammation extending well down on the
chin. Tte result of the application of
Herpicide was most gratif ying;. The loss
of beard ceased and a new grrowth of hair
Is now taking place over tbe once Inflamed
su-ea.

, A movement has been started to get the men,of the. civilized world to celebrate this year
the centennial of the adoption of the use of trousers instead of knee-breeches. Just what form
the celebration is to take has not been decided, but perhaps as good a -way as any would be to

It is stated that the British Ministry has no intention to restore to. Cape Colony the con
stitution that was. suspended during the war, but that, in place of it, all South Africa will be com
bined as a federation under one general government over which; Great Britain will exercise a close
supervision for some years to come- . .
An illustration of the rapidity with which electrical appliances have -improved and at the
same time, increased in cost is shown in the statement of the contractor for th'e'Underground Rapici
Transit Railroad in New York that at the time the estimates were first
that the electrical equipment would cost $7,000,000, but.it is now found triat td get the' latest and
best the equipments will cost upward of $18,600,000. "; i â¢ Â¦ 'Â¦-. â¢ -V X ;â¢ \ ;
A Pennsylvania clergyman has' been caught advertising for a wife and furthermore it has
been disclosed that in order to send a lock of hair to each of: his correspondents he bought an
-assorted lot from the village barber. /He/is now-accused of deception, but his defense is that' he
never said- the hair was his.' The case will probably.be known "as a "hairasy trial."
THE classic ten minutes," Henry
Miller laughingly apologized, as. so
much late for his appointment
with me, he groped his way into
the semi-darkness of the Columbia
auditorium on Tuesday morning last.
"An actor's clock Is always permitted
just eo much leeway, but no more, no
more," he concluded, as we settled our
selves into a loge, where the actor-man
cger could keep an eye and a half upon
the "Gay Lord Quex" rehearsal that was.
just beginning, and the other half upon
rne.
"You are looking very 'fit,' Mr. Miller
this morning " I began, as the actor's
particular kind of handsomeness with a
special air of elation loomed up In the
dimness.
"And what for no?" h^ said happily.
"Not that the morning â Tuesday morning
â always finds me quite so cheerful. But
the kindness of last night and the deli
cate and sympathetic understanding of
my own and my company's aims shown
by the critics in this morning's papers
have Just 'set me up,* as the phrase
goes. "You know, however hearty a first
night welcome may be, we players go to
bed only half sure â only half at ease,
until the papers come in the next morn
ing. We have done our best, but does the
public feel it, believe It?"
"I didn't think you so particularly
minded. Most, of you folk pretend to a
more or less healthful Indifference to
press opinion."
"As eels might pretend an indifference
to skinning, or cats to cream, until their
turn came," Mr. Miller indulgently com
mented. "My man brings me the papers
the first thing on Tuesday morning. He
is a German, by the way, with a vocabu
lary of criticism limited to Just two
phrases â'very nice' and 'very bad.' If
I did Virginius to his taste he would say,
when I asked bis opinion, 'very nice'; so,
.too. cf his breakfast steak. But this
morning's criticisms inspired him to new
effort and he called out "great!" as he
camÂ© in with them. He is not always
wise," and Mr. Miller here loked quite
sorry for his valet. "He brings in the oc
casional unfriendly notice before break
fast, saying 'very bad' with a thick
skinned frankness that makes it really
hard for him for a little while afterward.
Weâ he and Iâ suffered somewhat on the
way down. In Sacramento and Stockton,
lor example, the notices were unexpect
edly severe. You remember that 'Tre
lavray' has no part of particular promi
nence, as has "Heartsease* or 'The Only
Way,' and the critics found themselves,
therefore, I think a little unreasonably,
disappointed in the production. Merely a
case of misunderstanding. And that is
possibly why the unanimous sympathy of
the San Francisco papers came so agree
ably."
Mr. Miller then expressed his amused
admiration of San Francisco's independ
ence In the matter of criticism. "A play
may have been the success of two or
three seasons in the East, but that will
by no means establish a criterion of its
history here. You like things or you don't,
because you lSke them and not because
the Eastern playgoer has said 'this Is
gcod." Of course you go wrong some
times, but it is possibly better to be
wrong in your own way than right in
some one else's. Let me tell you my
little day dream for your city â "
But this, like other day dreams have
been, was rudely interrupted by an in
sistent demar.d for the gay Lord Quex
from the stage. Then, for the actor, came
the sweat and stress of a thirty minutes
that would drive the average eight-hour
unionist to suicide. One of the scenes of
the play takes place In a manicure shop.
"Does one wear his hat in a manicure
parlor?" Questions some one. -
WHILE the South African war was on there was an anomaly in British politics, in a
'practical disappearance of the Liberal party, and the almost unopposed rule' of a
majority that does not represent the best sentiment of the nation, and of a Ministry
that does not represent the best sentiment of the majority. The Conservatives would
have been glad to. get rid of the Ministry, and the people would have been glad'to get rid of the
Conservatives, but with the Boer war on this was impossible. -
The King, if he. have any partisan sympathy, is with the Liberals. But leaving out any
fellowship of that kind and granting that, he is. a Conservative, he does not like the Ministry
which he inherited with his crown. Salisbury is far from being a royal" favorite, and Cham
berlain is in but little better grace. ( Still, as long as the war lasted, there was no prospect of a
change in the personnel of the Ministry more agreeable to the throne. While a "desire to be
crowned as the ruler of an empire at peace may have influenced the King in dictating liberal
terms to end the war, it may well be that practical considerations were more than a make-weiÂ°-ht
to that purely sentimental, reason. â¢ ' .
The Ministry and .its party have been held together by the war. The country was tired of !
it and of therrij but there was nothing to be done but go ahead doggedly until the end was
reached. That being done/somebody must ' be brought to account.. The British taxpayer has
grinned and borne it while a billion and a half was added to the national debt, and he looks for- -
ward upon the expenditure of two hundred and fifty millions more to carry the exiled Boers back"
to their; homes, as the .treaty requires, and to return the quarter of a million soldiers back to Eng
land. When he is done grinning and bearing it, and can speak his mind without "* incurring the'
denunciatory verse of Kipling or the imperial epigrams of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, then the
party that has been in power and the Ministry that represents-it will., hear 'some criticisms have
some questions to answer and probably a house of refuge to seek.
It will be held responsible for a prolonged war, in which the British, fighting' force out
numbered the entire population cf the Transvaal and Orange Free State,, <md for defeat after de
feat, though the armed and; fighting enemy was outnumbered ten to one in men and guns. The
Chamberlain family war contracts, and all the speculations, peculations, and sins of. omission
and of commission, incident to the war, will come forward to be thrashed out, and there will prob
ably be a change of parties in power before the books are balanced. Lord Rosebery seems to
have forecast matters more wisely .than any other Liberal leader. He supported the Ministry and
the war, avowing that He did so as a loyal Englishman, though opposed in principle to both. He
has won favor by this course and has the friendship' of all that wing of the. Conservative party
that has chafed under the blunders of Salisbury and the insolence of Mr. 'Chamberlain.
It has come to be the law of action of the Anglo-Saxon race that party differences are in
tolerable in war, but are to be sought and promoted when it is over. As England has had
no politics since the war began, we may expect that the people will make up for lost time.
BRITISH PEACE POLITICS.
"I must go and see," says Miller. "Do
you -know, D'Orsay?"
"Don't know, I'm sure," came Lawrence
D'Orsay's magnificent English - accent.
"You don't in a milliner's."
"What are you going to call me?" Mrs.
Whiffen asks. "Some of you say Lady
'O-bridge,' some 'Ow-bridge.' "
" 'Ow-bridge' it is spelled," Mr. Backus,
stage-manager-in-chief, suggests. .
" 'O-bridge' is prettier," Mr. Miller do
termines.
"Yes, much softer," Mrs. Whiffen
agrees.
"There is a place in England spelt Trow
bridge and pronounced Tro-bridge," con
tributes Mr. D'Orsay.
" 'O-bridge.' let it be then," decides Mr.
Miller. Then, acting each part in turn
and sometimes all together t suggesting
here, advising there, with "Don't you,
think this?" "This must go thus," and
so on, Mr. Backus ably seconding, the
act is pulled into shape, and it is safe to
say that there will be no saw edges when
it corner home.
"To return to your day dream," I sug
gested, as, tired but happy, the actor
made his way to the loge again.
"Ah, yes! Well, I dream of a theater
for San Francisco in which shall be given
from year's end to year's end the best
of the drama, new and old; a theater with
the best players, the best plays, the best
settings; a theater in which one shall
know' exactly the kind of , thing one is
going to get;Un short, a theater of settled
policy, and that of the noblest" OC1 - L ' OU
"This Is interesting," I said, "is such a
thing among the likelihoods?" remember
ing the ground newly broken at Market
and Ninth for the Bouvier Theater
"That is more than I can say," said the
actor. "Possibly, yes. And why not?
ban t rancisco is already very largely
self-dependent in the matter of entertain
ment. You have many successful houses
of known policyâ the Tlvoli, Alcazar Or

all the Thursday and Sunday fellows will
say. He is- not going to risk his sacred
stomach to my uncertain mercies. Quite
right, too. The same with the theaters."
"Now, Mr. Miller, to put It definitely,
Is there any chance that you and this con
stellation of stars that are foregathering
now with you here are going to lighten
our darkness with such a company in
such a theater?" Â«iupuny, m
?i," 1 Â£ ink . n Â°y smlled th e actor, "though
the idea is fascinating (with the leatht

"You see." he went on, "such an in<?H

the home company to exploit while the

"I duly, am."

BEFORE Dr. H. J. Stewart went
away to Boston, something like a
year ago. Dr. Chismore asked the
Trinity Church organist how much
he would be content to live uponâ
fSOOO a year? Dr. Stewart replied that he
would be perfectly satisfied with that.'
"Then," Dr. Chismore saldi '.'you have
the annual $3000 that it Is worth to live in
California and all you make besides.
What is the matter with you?" Dr. Stew
art has now, returned from Boston and
tells Dr. Chismore that he i3 out for*. the
Cal'ifornian $5000 and anything else the
gods may provide, so long as they provide
it here.
There are many people who will be glad
cf the accomplished doctor's return, and
none more than himself. Liking Boston
and Its people very sincerely after his
year's stay at the "hub," he says he has
been too long a Californlan to live com
fortably anywhere else. The difference <
in atmosphere oppresses him, and his
hope of a broader field for his work failed
of realization. "Small as the opportuni
ties for organists are in San Francisco,
they are infinitely wider than they are in
Boston," says the doctor.. "The prevail
ing Puritanism has its .grip on the music
of the church, and the musical part of the
service is of the most meager character.
There are none of the sriiall musical
graces that brighten the service here, as
in the responses and so on, and as to or
gan recitals, they are simply not permit
ted. It is of course open to one to engage
Symphony Hall, with its magnificent in
strument, but that means $300, and organ
recitals in Boston, as elsewhere, are not
a paying proposition. I was much dis
appointed to find that I could do nothing
with recitals. The other organists with
whom I talked likewise deplored the t con
ditions, but confessed their inability to
change them. Why, in musical Boston no
one ever dreams of remaining to listen to
the closing voluntary. At Christmas 1
gave my 'Nativity' at Trinity Church, of
course with the consent of the authorities,
and packed the church from end to end.
But they were not at all sure.of the right
eousness of such things, though the suc
cess of the innovation was wholly unmis
takable. That kind of thing of course
comes queerly after California, and I am
too old a Californian to get used to It.
"Yes, there is more money to be made
there, but that, is by no means every
thing. In my own church the mu&ic bills
for the month reached JSOO, and you may
know that means that things wore done
quite handsomely. But 'there was no lee
way, no slightest opportunity for musical
embellishment, andâ wellâ here I am.
The actual deciding straw, however, was
the determination of the trustees to have
a boy choir. That finished my Boston
career. I know the boy choir perhaps as
intimately as most organists, having had
about -16, years' experience of them In
England, and belonged to one myself be
fore that. The boy choir Is a successful
possibility only under European condi
tions," as where the choristers are mem
bers of the cathedral schools, with com
pulsory singing twice a day, and an ed
ucation that bends most of its energy to
making musicians of them. Here, no. My
predecessor at Trinity fully agreed with
me, and I am not envying the lot of Mr.
Goodrich, who is my successor.
/'Outside of the church, music is highly
regarded in Boston. One thing connected
with my visit I look back upon with
much pleasure: the fact that I found
some time for composing and that my
work received a quick and warm appre
ciation from the people there. The sym
phony concerts are an unmixed delight.

THE attention of the country has been fixed on war ever since our little fight with Spain
tfegan. Young men in appreciable numbers have been 'Â¦withdrawn 'from the practice of
the arts of peace to follow war far abroad. Indeed American fighting blood was tip to
'such an extent that our countrymen were found on both sides in the Soutli African war
and the Boers say they were the only allies they had that were of any assistance. To' supply the
.drain in the. Philippines and to man the navy, calis are. necessary," and recruits present them
selves as fast as they are needed. *
It is to be hoped, however, that the martial spirit of our, people will be satiated by ser
vice in the National Guard, and that the thirst for war will, not increase, until the people under
value the arts of peace. v ' . . V ,'â¢ : X%v -
In three recent notable addresses President Roosevelt has properly extolled the army and
the navy. These addresses were at the Annapolis and West Point commencements and at Arling T
ton on Memorial day. The subjects upon which he must speak were of necessity military, and
the of our people in war, on land and sea,:cannot be too highly praised..
In his West Point speech he declared that the -graduates of that institution had ren
dered.greater service to. the country than any other, during its century of existence. If he
meant military service, as of course he did, his praise was well bestowed. In other respects the
progress of the country and the growth of the people in greatness must be ascribed to other
than military service. J . ; . ; ' . ! Mf^
When the civilian and the- military man come to be compared in regard to their impor
tance and vaiue to the country, the civilian seems to be more necessary than the soldier; peace
is the more permanent condition, and its arts the more necessary. The world has profited more
from the spinning machines, the cotton gin, the discovery and utilization of the expansive force
of steam, the. machines^ for sewing and for harvesting, and from the invention of/ the telegraph
and telephone, than from all the wars and, military exploits and acts of war known to men from
the beginning. What civilians'like Morse, Stephenson, Slater, Bessemer, Dale, Fulton, Howe,
Burbank, and the great company of inventors," naturalists and physicists, have done for man, to
clothe,Â«shelter and feed him better and at less cost, to extend and cheapen his means of com
munication, of transportation and travel, is at least equal in importance to the destruction of life
and properly by military art. . . .
In Washington city are the statues- and monuments of many American worthies,
but among them are the memorials of only two civilians, Benjamin Franklin and Albert Pike, and
neither was erected by the Government. In the Hall of Statuary,' in the Capitol, are memorials
contributed by the States, 'in which other professions and pursuits than the military are recog
nized, but the Government itself has celebrated almost entirely our military worthies, to whom'
let all honor be ascribed, but they have, not the monopoly of service to the country. If war were
the only proper and worthy calling of man, the world would yet be in barbarism. The art. de
fensive and offensive is only one of the causes of progress and means of service to the race. It
would itself die and disappear did not thwarts of peace feed it. These make states by the study of
civics and develop them by economics and skill and industry, and thereby create a prey which is
coveted by. war, and it rages to their destruction.
West Point and Annapolis are great schools, and our war days and anniversaries are high
dates in our national history, but these are not all nor the greater part of our national growth
and glory. That must be sought and found to be the work of men who know nothing of military
tactics, but are profoundly skilled in creative art.
Among the causes of the decay of Rome was the prominence given to the two professions,
war and law. ' Every Roman who wanted to be something sought to attain it in the army or
at the bar. The other professions and the economic arts were neglected. The. beginning of this
destructive policy is not noted in history. It simply became; the habit of the people and its growth
was sinister and furtive, but every word uttered in praise of war and military art contributed to it.
We do not desire the growth of such a; spirit; here. -Therefore it is time to present our
civilian worthies to the admiration of the people who are the beneficiaries of their genius and* toil.

MARTINEZ, June 14.â The trial of Dr.
William Rider Powell for the killing of
Albert Crandall on February 12, near the
town of Clayton, has occupied the atten

S. Wells presiding, for the past ten days.
At 4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
case was submitted to the jury. At 8:30
o'clock this morning the jurors came into
court with a verdict of acquittal.
The killing of Albert Crandall was the
sequel to a long-drawn-out quarrel over
land in the vicinity of Clayton. Dr. Pow
ell was for years at feud with several of
his neighbors. On the day of the tragedy
Crandall . and a man named Bendixon
drove up to where Powell was erecting
a fence around disputed property. Powell
warned them away, but Crandall got out
of his vehicle and started toward the old
man. Powell .took a revolver, from, a sack
tying near the fence and fired at Crandall,
killing him. The old man then mounted
a horse and came to Martinez, giving
himself up. In the trial just closed he
set up the plea of self-defens"e, declaring
that he had fired only after Crandall had
seized him and declared he would kill

The appearance of the disease in Ma
nila in March Is 1 attributed in some quar
ters to vegetables coming into the islands
from infected Chinese ports, and in others
to the drinking of Pasig P.iver water, foul
with the sewage of the city. Lieuten
ant Colonel Heinzman says that the num
ber of different points attacked by the
epidemic and the consequent infection of
many streams which are universally used
for drinking and bathing, and into which
all foul material and garbage find their
way, makes probable a large number of
deaths before the rains, which ended the
two great epidemics in the 80' s, occur.
The army, he says, is much better pro
tected than the native or than civil
Americans in the island, because of the
care which is .exercised in supplying good
food and water.
In Manila alone a total of 277 cases
with 215 deaths had occurred up to April
15, the date of the report, with 453 cases
and S08 deaths outside the city.
The House Committee on Insular Af
fairs to-day arranged the details of the

minute rule, with a final vote at 5 p. m.
on Thursday. The day sessions are to
begin at 11 a. m. and night sessions last

debate only. Ample opportunity is to be
â¢given for amendments, substitutes, etc.,
although It is practically certain the bill
will pass as reported to the House.
The committee voted to substitute the
House for the Senate measure, and a mo

for Philippine independence after a four

Sarah Nelson has brought a suit for di
vorce against Louis Nelson, alleging fail
ure to provide. Mrs. Nelson alleges that
her husband, who is a carpenter on the
steamship City of Peking, has not pro
vided for her for a year.
Delia Reynolds, who was married to
Frank Reynolds at Ridgeway, N. Y., in
18S6, commenced an action for divorce
yesterday, alleging willful neglect and
failure to provide. She alleges that for
the last year her husband has not con
tributed toward the support of herself or
her 8-year-old daughter. â¢
John E. Morris, who was married to
Ella Morris at Petaluma in October. 1892,
filed a suit for divorce yesterday, alleging
desertion. He charges her with leaving
him in June, 1901. They have three chiU
dren, the custody of whom Morris asks
for.
Levy alleges further that his wife got
"sore" at him because he would not con
tribute to the support of her able-bodied
brother. She refused to cook his meals,
alleges Levy, and to show her contempt
for him tore up her marriage certificate
and threatened to sell her wedding ring.
On May 20, alleges Levy, his wife com
manded him to leave his happy home,
threatening that in the event he failed to
do so she would "cut his throat." She
said on this occasion, alleges Levy, "If
you don't go out or if you go to bed to
night in this place I will cut your throat.
You will never get out of that bed alive."
Levy alleges further that Mrs. Levy. has
ever since their marriage made it a prac
tice to throw hatchets, pieces of wood
and other handy missiles at him, thereby
causing his life to become a burden.
Mrs. Levy ha's done many other things
and said many unkind words, alleges her
"husband, that have caused him a great
deal of mental suffering. He alleges that
she commenced worrying him six months
after their marriage at Oakland, in Aug
ust, 1901, and kept it up until May 20 of
this year, when she attacked him with a
bottle and a razor and threatened to cut
his throat If he did not get out of the
house.
Such is the language used by Caroline
E. Levy, according to a divorce complaint
filed by Seamon Levy yesterday.
"I have no use for you! I despise you!
I hate you! I am sorry I ever married
you. There is only one man I love, and I

to Rest in Mount Olivet
Cemetery. "
Heaviest Man in the. "World Is Laid
- The remains of . Henry, Maurice Cannon
were laid in their last resting place in
Mount Olivet - Cemetery yesterday, the
funeral ceremony being under the aus
pices of the California Schuetzen Verela,
an organization of which the deceased
had been an ardent member.
The services were held in the under
taking "rooms of Suhr & Co. and were
conducted by the Rev. Mr. Julius Fuen
deling, pastor of- St. Markus German
Evangelical Lutheran Church.
Cannon had the reputation of being the
largest man in the world and -when it
came to arrange for his funeral it was
seen at once that not only would the
casket have to be of proportions larger
than had ever been before called for,
but the hearse also would have to be the
largest in the city. One ordinary burial
lot proving inadequate it was necessary
to take in two plots for the grave.
There were ten pall bearers and an im
mense crowd was at the undertaker's
establishment to join in respectful tribute
to the deceased, who had made many
friends during his residence in the city.

asked him where he had been. '
According to Mrs. Clark's complaint
she left Stockton three years ago, taking
her daughter with her, and took up , her
residence here. .She alleges that after she
left her husband would make frequent
trips to the city and remain several days
before calling upon her. When he did
visit her, she alleges, he would apply vile
language to her, thereby causing her a
great deal of misery.. . . .^
After his return he remained out late at night
and refused to tell me what kept j him away
from home. He came In one morning at 1
o'clock and when I spoke to him about hia

I asked my husband about the letter and ho

"A short time afterward he . asked . me to go
with him to Lake Tahoe, and I refused, because
my health would not permit of the trip. When
I told him 1 could not accompany him he
swore at me and struck me. He left Stockton
a . day or so afterward and went to Los An

Mrs. Clark says her troubles began
eight years ago, when she found the let

made the defendant in a divorce suit.
Mrs. Mary C. Clark, the plaintiff, alleges

O. K. BUCKHOCT,
Chairman Italamazoo Tuberculosis Remedy Co.
(Ltd.). and Member British Tuber-
culosis Congress.
Consumptives need not worry about their
future any more, as the long-looked-for cure
lor consumption has at last come out, and a
cure is now just as sure as in the simplest
disease. To satisfy yourself of this you have
only to write the Kalamazoo Tubercu-
losis Remedy Co., 231 Main street, Kala-
mazoo, Michigan, of which the- chair-
man is Mr. O. K. Euckhout, a noted
member of the British Tuberculosis Congress,
composed of world-famous men who have made
consumption a life study. This cure is some-
thing entirely- new and is called "Antidotum
Tuberculose," or the Copper Cure, and Is the
only discovery we know of that absolutely
kills all tuberculosis germs which cause con-
sumption, as unless this is done the disease
cannot be cured. As the name of the remedy j
tells, its chief ingredient is copper, which ',
metal has at last been found to be the deadly I
enemy of the consumption germ, "Antidotum j
Tuberculese" is the original Copper Cure. j
You can tell if you have consumption by the
coughing and hawking, by continually spitting,
especially in the morning, when you throw
yellow and black matter, by bleeding from the
lungs, night sweats, flat cheet, fever, weak
voice, peculiar flushed complexion, pain In
chest, wasting away of the flesh, etc. Find out
how the Copper Cure kills the germs, then
builds up the lungs, strengthens the heart,
puts flesh on the body and muscles on the
bones until the consumption is all gone and
you are egaln a strong, healthy, robust man
or woman.
Don't doubt this, for the very came discov-
ery benefited A- H. Dingley, a son of Congress-
man Dingley of Dingley Tariff Bill fame, who
went "West aad South for relief and didn't get
It, and came back with death etaring him In
the face, and was benefited by Antidotum
Tuberculose after all else had failed. It cured
John Devries cf ICaJamazoo of galloping con-
sumption; Adrian de Die, 1638 S. West street,
cf quick consumption; Paul de Smith cf Dal- ',
ton, Mich., and many cases which wasted away
to skeletons. Â¦ â¢
So don't give up hope, and don't spend your
money in travel. Attend to it right away, for
consumption spreads to other members of the
family. Write to-night to the Kalamazoo
Tuberculosis Remedy Co., 231 Main street,
Kalamazoo, Mich., and they will eend â¢ you
books free of charge telling you how the Cop-
per Cure will cure you In your own home in
a very short time.

SUNKO MEN SPIRIT AWAY
A COMPLAINING WITNESS
In Dismissing the Case of Frank
Wilson Judge Fritz Makes
Some Remarks.
The case of Frank "Wilson, . a bunko
man. charged with â¢ grand larceny for
swindling John E. Graves, a visitor from
Detroit, Mich., out of $60 at a poker game
last Tuesday, was called in Judge Fritz's
court yesterday \ morning. Detectives
Crockett and Riordan said that they had
been unable to find the complaining wit
ness and were satisfied he had been spir
ited away. .
The Judge, in dismissing the case, said:
"It seems to me that ln a case of this
kind the police department ought, if
necessary, in all ( these cases to board and
lodge the complaining witnesses for a few
days till after the preliminary hearing.
In these cases the complaining witness
invariably disappears and in this partic
ular" case I feel satisfied that the friends

thl3 afternoon. The wedding, though a
home affair . was an elaborate one and
many guests were present. The home of
Mrs. J. Maillard. the sister of the bride,
where the ceremony took place, was ap
propriately decorated, the parlor and re

flowers and smilax. The bride and groom
stood under a bower of wild flowers in the
west parlor. Rev. E. J. Lion officiated.
The bride was given away by her brother,
W. E. Page, and J. E. Twigga acted as
best man. There were no bridesmaids.
Following the ceremony the bridal party
and 100 guests partook of a bountiful re

cook in the home of the Governor, they
realized that Gage was a loser. The pa
roling of furniture from San Quentin was
bad enough, and the scandalous Kern
County bond transaction, wherein the
school fund suffered a loss of $16,000, was
worse, but the politicians maintain that
the employment of a Chinaman in the
Governor's kitchen Is the offense which
the workingmen will not pardon at the
polls.
The Republicans of California have
practically repudiated Gage. "What little
strength he may derive in the election of
delegates to the State convention will be
thrown to him by Democratic voters, who
desire his nomination for the sole reason
that he is the weakest Republican aspir
ant in the field.
GAGE IS KEPTJTtfATED.
The Democrats, however, are so anxious
that Gage shall be nominated that they
have resolved to vote at the primary
election for delegates to the Republican
convention. Word comes from Los An
geles that a few Democratic votes will be
cast in each Assembly District for
Snyder delegates to the Democratic State
Convention, but that the main body of
Democrats will' vote for Republican dele
gates favorable to Gage. A similar game
was played by the bosses in San Fran
cisco last August. At least five thousand
Democratic voters were called to the aid
of the machine ticket. In fact the Demo
crats under the leadership of Sam
Rainey, Herrin, Greany and Jere Burke
gave the convention to the bosses. Re
publican voters at the municipal election
following resented the intrusion by re
pudiating the ticket.
Tehama County Republicans elected
delegates to the State convention yester
day. The delegation is opposed to Gage.
To-morrow Tulare County Republicans
will meet and the indications are that
delegates opposed to the renominatlon of
Gage will . be chosen. The opposition to
Gage is growing wider and 'deeper. The
push politicians are so badly rattled that
they cannot get together and put up a
formidable contest against the good gov
ernment forces.

A feature of the trial was the testimony
of Hay's father-in-law, James Sharp,
who claimed to have had a revelation
from God that Mortensen was the mur
derer. * _^
The trial began May 5 and It took four
weeks to get a jury, which was secured
only after an open venire had teen de
clared. The testimony and argument oc
cupied two weeks and the jury was out
three hours. The verdict was reached
unanimously on the first ballot.
Hay, who was a neighbor of Mortensen,
was secretary of the Pacific Lumber
Company, to which company Mortensen
was indebted in the amount of $3800. On
December 16 Mortensen requested Hay to
call that night at his home, bring a re
ceipt for the sum and he would pay him
the money. Hay was 'not seen alive after
calling at Mortensen's house. Two day3
later Hay's body was found buried near
Mortensen's house. Hay had been shot.
Mortensen was arrested on suspicion
and in his pocket was found a receipt for
the money and an uncanceled note. MOr
tensen claimed he had paid the money to
Hay in $20 gold pieces, but told conflicting
stories about it *

TEXT OF THE COMPLAINT.
Constable Carlson decided to-night that
he would not Berve the warrants. Carlson
admitted that the job was too big for
him. He appealed to the Justice under
whom he serves and was sent to the
Sheriff. The papers were then turned over
to Sheriff Hammel and he will leave on
Monday morning for San Francisco to
serve them. He will simply present the
warrants and follow such legal course as
the convenience of the defendants neces
sitates. Following is the complaint:
Accompanied by several friends the Gov
ernor went to San Pedro to-day and re
paired at once to the office of Justice
Downing, who had been notified of hla
coming and was waiting for the party.
The proceedings in the courtroom on the
top floor of a rickety building, on the first
floor of which. is a ship chandler's store,
were brief. The complaint, which bore
the formal approval of District Attorney
Rives, was tendered to the Justice, who
administered the oath to Gage. The war
rant was then issued, the rorm having al
ready been prepared by the Governor's
attorneys, and. all that Justice Downing
had to do was to affix his signature and
BeaL The warrant was placed In the
hands of Constable Carl T. Carlson of
Wilmington. Township and the party then
departed.

Question Now Offered By
Pommer-Eilers Music Com-
pany at a Very Great
Saving.
Many cheap pianos are little better than
Imitation goods. They fall far short of
the standard In appearance and tone,
even when new, and after a few years'"
use they become a positive detriment to
a home. Yet to find a low priced piano
of quality Is a difficult problem that many
homes must solve. With an experience
of twenty years to guide us we are able
to offer very unusual piano Qualities at
low prices. Ix>ok at our leaders at $133,
H58, $162 and J1S5. Then at $200, J225 and
upwardâ exhibits of pianos that any one
might be proud of. They are all offered
"very easy payments.
Also cote that this week a limited num-
ber of pianos returned from rental go on
sale. Borne of these Instruments are EUb-
gtantlally new and all are marked so
low aa to be genuine bargains.
Also second-hand pianos taken, in ex-
change. These are offered between $75
and {ISO each, and then the prospective
buyer must take Into consideration, that
this Includes the outlay we have made
tor repairs.
Several new IvimbaJl, Decker and Haz-
Â«ltons of last year's styles that are
changed somewhat this year are offered
at a heavy bona fide reduction to close
oot at once. This Is an opportunity for
persons wishing to place several hundred
dollars in a most judicious investment-
Used pianos taken in exchange. Chiek-
ericg upright 5225, plain rosewood Crown
*iprigiit $215, Weser uprlgrht. up-to-date,
SLS5, Emerson upright $1G5, and many oth-
ers. Very handsome large size Kimball
â¢upright at the remarkable price of $300.
A very fine Hazelton baby grand as good
as new, returned from loan to an artist,
$635. Beautiful special style Decker up-
right, mottled walnut case, carved panels,
$275. Beautiful new mahogany Schumann
upright, slightly marred in transit, will
be cacriSced at $190. Kimball, Decker
and Lester uprights having had some use
at $250, $300 and upward.
A score of second-hand square pianos at
from $23 to $T5 eachâ will be put In good
repair.
Visitors are cordially welcomed In our
salesrooms from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. Groups
of piano customers will always be found
upon our floor but we have ample facil-

ba secured on small first payment,
the remainder on easy monthly pay-
ments. No advance in prices when
easy terms are desired. Pianos of
all descriptions Included in this
offer.
Buyers at a distance should write for
special bargain list of pianos. We ship

v;etks on the mother lode by reason of

The What Cheer mine ln Calaveras
County will resume. It was been shut
down about fourteen years. The Cala
veras mine has been unwatered and soon
will be working again.
The Los Angeles Herald cays:
PBOFITS ARE POSSIBLE.
Therefore, from actual results so far obtain
ed. It is evident that many low grade propo
sitions, which formerly could, not be touched
will now yield handsome profits, and as both
sulphide arid oxidized ores can be worked with
facility and economy, many of these mines now
being reopened will give handsome returns
Prominent mining men from all over the
coast are constantly looking over the old Hav
ilah hills lately, and experienced and conserva
tive ones among them are taking hold of these
properties which were, thirty years ago, good
producers. Others are developing large' veins
carrying low grade sulphide ores right at the
very outcrop.
The development work now being done at
Havilah is up to date and effective and on the
good and solid basis of going in to produce bul
lion, and opening up for future permanent
work. The men ln charge of the work are of
high ability and long practical experience.
Among the principal mining enterprises
in the Haviland district are the Big Four
Company's tunnel, about half a mile
north from Havilah; the Golden Eagle
Mining Company's tunnel. In the vicinity
of Rand Hill; the McKidney mine, which
will be immediately reopened; the War
rington Company plant; the Friday mine,
which has recently been reopened; the
King Solomon or Morning Glory plant,
near Havilah; the Lady Belle mine, near
Kernvllle. A cheap power supply will
soon be added to Havilah district through
the construction of a canal.
The result was thai through coarse crushing
end a very even distribution of the pulp in the
tanks the mechanical difficulties â¢ were soon
overcome; also, through proper neutralization
of the acids in the ores and the proper strength
of solutions used, the chemical problems were
satisfactorily solved, and the plant now proved
a. treat success.
Since then many thousands of dollars
have been produced from the Warrington
tailings and the yield has been as high as
1 of th * assays value of the
ores, with a total expense of less than $1
per ton. Many exhaustive tests have been
made upon the ores from the Sumner and
Lacy BeJe mines at Kernville and the
conclusion has been reached that all ores
in the Havilah and surrounding districts
Zt V tt e treat^ ** cheaply and effectively
by the cyanide process and that about
40 per cent of the additional gross output
may be expected in future operations from
nearly all the ores over the early day
production from amalgamation alone and

DIFFICTJIiTIES SOLVED.
Several years after the first experiments
With the cyanlfie process at Havilah two cya
ruGe plants were built for the purpose of work
ing ialUng*- jd!rect from the stamps â an 8-ton
plant' at the Dnnmore Company's mill and a
Â£0-ton plant at the Warrington mill. At both
Plants so many difficulties were In the begin
ning met with, chiefly mechanical ones, that
the whole undertaking threatened to prov* a
failure until, through a change In the manage
ment of the Warrington mine, the cyanide
plant was entirely remodeled and suited to the
requirements of the ores to be treated. This
charge was brought about by G. E. Thede the
present superintendent, who had previously
tcacie exhaustive tests upon this subject.
Had the tailings, which were In early days ao
thoughtlessly wasted, been at hand, more
than enough money could have been gt>t In
clear profit from them to reopen every mine in
the camp in good shape. It was, however, be
lieved, tnat tailings fresh from the stamps
could also be worked as well as these old tail
ings which, it was true, had had ample time to
become oxidized while lying under atmospheric
influences. This, however, remained to be
proven.
The cold was lost and ran down the
rt^ep gulches, never more to be redeemed.
The sulphide ores, which were really the
richer, were accordingly put aside and
enly the decomposed ores went through
the mills. Where sulphide ores were
taken out from the mines they were,
shortsightedly, thrown out on the dumps.
r*o attempts were made to save the tail
ings, although it was known that they
sail retained high values. Several mills
were destroyed by fire and soon the mines
were abandoned. Gradually they were
allowed to cave In and there appeared
then to be little inducement for any one
to reopen them. In the relapse of twenty
five years the difficulty of enlisting cap
ital in the mines became constantly great
er. How daylight finally dawned on the
camp is told by a correspondent He
Eay8:
Daylight canse through the eplendid results
obtained In other localities by the cyanide pro
cess. As early as 1892 Messrs. Stebbins ' and
Porter began experiments upon small lota of
tailings at Havliah and were finally successful
in extracting as high as 91 per cent of the pre
cious metals from the ores. Tailings assayed
$15, $20 and up to $48. The tailings were soon.
exhausted The results that were accomplish
ed attracted much attention on the part of the
minir.g men.
THE GOLD B.JJTNS AWAY.
The cyanide treatment of gold ores In
Ivern County forms an lnteresUng chap
ter In the history of mining In Califor
nia. Havilah is about twenty-five miles
from Caliente station on the Southern Pa
cific lane, and is reached by a good wagoa
road. Havilah was once a prosperous
mining camp and was the county seat in
tne 60s, and was an ideal poor man's
camp, as the surface ores were of high
grade and were easily reduced. For years
eoveral large and small 6tamp mills were
running at Havilah and fortunes were
ttade there by small and large operators
alike.
The period came, as to other camps,
when the soft, decomposed surface ores
became more or less exhausted and hard
ground and water were struck, together
with sulphide ores, from which latter
there was then no feasible process in
sight to extract the bullion. Grinding in
pjtns, with mercury, proved to be unsatis
factory. Many mines had to be aban
doned. The rich sulphide ores were con
sidered a great detriment In places where
they were mixed with decomposed ores In
the mines, as expense had to be in
curred both together and then in sorting
the sulphide ores in order to mill the
oecomposed ores alone. Many attempts
were made to mill both eorta of ores to
gether, but failure was the result.

When I've j
Cured You
DR. 0- 0. J08LEN. j
Leading Specialist. J a
Who call upon me ln consultation some- I
times express doubt as to' my ability to I
effect a permanent cure. â¢ Some say, I
"I've Â©aid half a Â¦ dozen doctors for P
cures that I never received." PAY MB LI
WHEN I'VE CURED YOU is the H
straightforward, definite and business- [j
like proposition I make to every afflict- f
ed man. . 14
' "Weakness" |
If other physicians have treated you H
for so-called "weakness" you were H
helped only temporarily. If at all and B
the reason Is very apparent when the f
cause of loss of- power ln man is Un-
derstood. "Weakness" Isn't a weak-'
ness at all. but Is merely a symptom
of chronic Inflammation ln the prostate r
gland, brought on by early dissipation
or some contracted disorder. My sys-
tem of local treatment removes this in-
flammation, and Is the only treatment
that has ever or ever can permanently
restore strength and vigor.
VnrfrÂ»ArÂ»f>1f>
Many who are but slightly afflicted
with varicocele believe that the trouble
Is of little consequence. The opposite is I
true. Varicocele is a disease of a pro- 1
gxesslve nature. As it advances, nerv- I
ous complications come, power dlmin- I
ishes. and the general health is im- L
paired. I cure varicocele ln nve days, I
without the use of knife, llrature or I
caustic, without nain. and without de- E
tention from business. I
Contracted Disorders f
Every case of contracted disease I I
treat Is thoroughly cured. My patients t
have no relapses. When I pronounce a t
case cured there is not a particle of in- {
fectlon or inflammation remaining, and I
there Is not the slightest danger that I
the disease will return ln Its original I
form or work its way Into the general I
system. No contracted disorder Is so t
trivial as to Warrant uncertain methods I
of treatment.' and I especially solicit E
those cases that other doctors have been I
unable to cur*. ... I
Specific Blood Poison.
To men who' for years have been dosed
*wlth dangerous mineral poisons ln an
(endeavor to keep this hideous leprosy
Â«lormant, my statement that I positive-
ly drive the very last taint of virus
ifrom the system may seem like an ex-
aggeration. But I accomplish Just this, i
and without the use of dangerous drugs.
My. treatment for contagious blood
.poison thoroughly cleanses the entire 'Â¦
fystem ln a remarkably short time,
and every trace and symptom disap-
pears forever. '

TRIBUTE ; TO. "WOMEN.
Shortridge was frequently Interrupted
by applause, and when, he paused once,
as if he were about to bring his remarks
to a close, he was requested, to "go on."
At the conclusion . of his speech, and in
troducing Lou B. Wlnsor, Toastmaster
Murphy called attention to the fact that,
although the . Order of Mystio, Shriners
had existed for twenty-eight years, it was
the first occasion that women had been
given the privilege of gracing the banquet
with their presence. He. said that the lo
cal husbands were certainly very recreant,
but *that they had set a very commend
able precedent in this venture, and he
hoped it would be followed at all future
banquets of the Shriners. Potentate Mur
phy's sentiments met with the hearty; ap
proval of all present. â¢'-... . - ; -
In presenting Lou B. Winsor, past im
perial potentate, Murphy explained that
several of the Nobles who were down for
speeches, at: the banquet had taken their
departure . from the city. ' He â¢ said that
the occasion would certainly v not be , a
complete success unless Lou Winsor made
a few remarks. The past potentate vis
ited this city, about a year ago, when on
a pilgrimage -to Honolulu, and he has
many jfriends here. When he stepped
forth to respond he was given a flattering
reception. He paid a glowing tribute to
the hospitality of San Franciscans and of
theState... ; .. ] ':.>','.; ; . ' Â¦' \
J Past Potentate Winsor said that he was
almost overwhelmed by the flattering re
ception hehad received. He said that be
cause of >the manner in 'which , he was
treated ; during his 'previous" visit to this
city he felt that he owed such : a heavy
debt of " gratitude I to our citizens that .he
would : have to- file bankruptcy 1 proceed
ings, ; ; After paying a' compliment to ' tho
'eloquent manner In- which His 'predeces

his remarks,' Potentate VWinsor said the
United States ' was . the grandest country
California, out here by -the -shore, which is
washed by the waves of the Western ocean, is
part of the Union. â At the first, political con
vention that was held iii California, ' in 1S40,
the first cardinal resolution that was . adopted
Next to New' York came that State Ohio,
which was carved out'of the Western reserve,
and which is so devoted to promoting the wel
fare of the United States that she desires to
furnish all our Presidents." Ohio was the
birthplace of four of our Governors. Georgia
gave us one, 'Maine gave us two and Wisconsin
has the honor of furnishing James H. Budd,
one of our living ex-Governors. Pennsylvania
and that small but unconquerable isle called
Ireland, out In the midst of the blue sea, both
gave us a Governor. (Laughter.) All that we
have and all that 'we are we owe to you.
I will not speak of California because In de
scribing her I would use ail the extravagance
of a lover. I am stuck on California. Nobles
and visitors from our sister States, whatever
we are you have made us. Who and what were
the pioneers? They camÂ© from â¢ the Southern
States, from "New England, and from the West
ern Keserve. From all the States of the Union
came our pioneer fathers and. mothers. God
bless them. They placed the flag of civilization
on this Western coast. Whatever of. civiliza
tion, whatever of manliness and whatever of
beauty our women possess we owe it to the
South, the North and the East, who sent the
pioneers to this' State. (Applause.) New York
has the honor of being the originator of the
Order of Mystic Shrlners. Of the twenty Gov
ernors who have held office in this State, five
of them came. from New York. The Empire
State also had the honor of being the birthplace
of Leland Stanford,' founder of our great uni
versity. Â¦â¢,..'.-Â¦-,.

Illustrious Potentates, Imperial Potentates
and Nobles: California welcomes you with un
equivocal pleasure and she will bid good
by with unfeigned regret. From Georgia and
all over the South, from the East, sterile and
unfertile It may be, but still beautiful, from
the North and from the glorious middle West
you have come to do honor to California, and
this Golden State blushes and opens her heart
to the Nobles and the beautiful women who
have accompanied- them. California with her
feet laved by the \ waves of the Western sea
and her mountains crowned with caps of virgin
â¢now welcomes 'the noble men who have mad*
duce J by the toastmaster as "the pride
of Islam and California." Shortridge was.
warmly received, and he spoke in part as
fellows:
Many of us hav* made our first trip to the
Pacific ' Coast, but to . all of us the .trip and
your reception of us has been a revelation.' I
can ecarcely find language to express Just
how I feel concerning your remarkable re
sources, your . wonderful hospitality. (Ap
plause.) I ' can scarcely . realize the . situation.
It has been both novel and instructive to us.
We have seen your wonderful country; have
admired your great resources and have enjoyed
your boundless hospitality and good will. (Ap
plause.) â¢ We can scarcely find words to'ex
press our gratitude for 'all you have done for
us. We stand aghast when we think how help
less we are when It conies to repaying you.
In a year from now we shall meet in Saratoga
Springs. I extend to all of you a hearty invi
tation to come and rest yourselves under our
trees and let us entertain you Just one-half as
well aa you have entertained us. (Applause.)
When I return to my people I will tell them
how well you have treated us, and of all you
have done to make us comfortable. In behalf
of the Imperial Council and of those who have
come with us. I thank you from 'my heart.
Samuel M. Shortridge was next Intro-
When the Imperial potentate arose he
was greeted with great applause by the
company, which rose and sang "For He's
a Jolly Good Fellow." Alken was given a
warm reception as he surveyed the com
pany and awaited the' opportunity to
speak. He spoke on the subject of "The
Imperial Council," saying that there were
73,000 in this country, and that it was a
distinct honor for any. man' as humble as
himself to preside over so great a body
of gentlemen and NoWes. Resuming, he
said: Â¦ . .
I eay to you welcome, thrice welcome. I
regret that so many of our brethren have left
us. We have attempted In the past few days
to express by our acts 'and not merely In
words, our heartfelt welcome to our brethren
from afar. To those who have left us we
voice our earnest farewell. Those who are
with us here on* this occasion we greet with
hearty rood will." Among them we have our
new Imperial potentate, Henry C. Akin, and it

LOS ANGELES, June 14.â If there were
any features to the game between the
Senators and Seraphs this afternoon it
was the wilaness of Dowling and'Hart
wcll. It was almost a stand-off- in the
first three innings, but Hartwell finally
located the plate and pitched good ball
after the third, while Dowling was oblig
ed to retire In favor of. Cutter. There
was comparatively little batting, the lo
cals getting but four singles and the vis
itors live singles and a double. A total of
twelve bases on balls, ten errors, .and
eight stolen bases, however, allowed more
runs than Were earned. Roach's assist
; from right field to third base was a bright
spot in an unusually loose game. Cutter
pitched winning ball in all his innings
but the s-txne could not oe pulled back
from where Dowling had put it. Score:

ENGLISH DERBY CANDIDATE.
But It was not for Blues nor for Tam
many. Cleverly rated close to the rail,
Wonderly was bringing in Gold Heels.
For a sixteenth of a mile they were al
most alone. But Blues' heart went faint,
and well into the stretch Gold Heels
was overhauling him, -passing him, lead-
Ing him. Then came that grand struggle
of Pentecost's. Four lengths in the rear
was Madden's horse when the leaders
turned into the stretch, but on he came,
gaining at every stride. A hundred yards
rrom the finish he had Blues beaten, and
*lowly he began to creep up cm Gold
Heels. But no mean foe met him there.
Gold Heels sprang forward again under
Wonderly's urging. Thus they passed un
der the wire. Gold Heels first by a half
length, Pentecost a short length in front
of Blues.
But Blues' dash had not been chal
lenged. He shot past Gold Heels and
Boon there was a ciear length of daylight
between them. Then came the greatest
cheer of the race. Tammany in silk hats,
Tammany in eilk petticoats, Tammany in
brass buttons and blue, Tammany In
rusty apparelâ Tammany roared from its
lusty throat, "Blues! Blues! Blues!"
PENTECOST'S GRAND EFFORT.
Gold Heels, off sixth, rushed ahead, and
when they lirst passed the wire was neck
and neck with Pentecost and Contend.
Closing in the backstrctch Shaw, on
Blues, thought his chance had. come and
raced to the front. Contend was still in
the lead, but wise little Cochran was try
ing to save him even then. Blues dashed
past Pentecost, butting him hard. Pente
cost, a long striding horse, was caught
off his balance and sheered heavily into
Contend. Then Contend gave up the
Khost and fell to the rear, finishing abso
lutely last.
Behind these three, Gold Heels, Pente
cost and Blues, there was Sadie S fourth,
lengths and lengths behind . the horses
that will make turf history^ Herbert,
too, was still farther back with Reina,
lucky winner of the Brooklyn handicap.
Saddest of all was Advance Guard. Well
away from the post, he dropped back and
was last before the first turn was passed.
Ptrhaps he did not take kindly to .Bull
iran alter Burns' jockeyship.
Gold Heels it was through the stretch.
Maybe Pentecost, having made up five
lengths in his eflort to reach the leader,
could have beaten the son of The Bard,
Lut once he felt a worthy rival at his
tide Gold Heels look on new life. He
sprang ahead, holding his advantage, short
though it was, to the end.
ADVANCE GUAKD DBOPS BACK.
Gold Heels beat Pentecost a short half
length. Blues, Tammany's pride, awoke
when two-thirds of the distance had been
dene to the cheers of his loyal adherents.
But when the prize was so close that it
teemed within the grasp of Frank Far
rcJl's champion the battered Pentecost
came from his ill-deserved place amid the
luck and beat the four-year-old into plti
lul submission.
It was a day of records. Never on any
American course, to every part of which
an admission fee is charged, has such a
tiemendous concourse of humanity wit
nessed a struggle between thoroughbred
racers. Fully 50,000 people watched the
Suburban from boxes and grand stand,
from trees, from roofs and from lawn,
from cheap field and from the stable in
eJesure.

Shay was the hero. In the fifth round,
with two out and the ball in keeping of
the shortstop, Danny made a wild dash
lor the plate and beat the throw. It was
a daring piece of work; and the crowd
nearly went wild. Besides this, Shay
slammed out a fine three-bagger and a'
sii:gle, stole two bases and fielded well,
with the exception of one error. Parrott
had six chances in the center plat and
took them all with a deal of grace, be
sides making the first hit for the Pony
bunch. . Â¦-Â¦Â¦.'
Oakland began work in a hurry, and
two doubles by Streib and McCreedie and
a single by .Mohler netted a pair of points.

bad errors. Threahits earned another in
the fourth. \ â¢ ' - 'Â¦ ' '
Â¦ It remained for the fifth to furnish the
skyrockets and the Ponies were all there.
Kcrdyke led off with a drive to right for
two stations and the rest of the crfcwd.

Shay made his spectacular steal of the
home rubber. This proved to be the win

It reminded the fans of old times yes
lerday afternoon to see the Ponies win by_
a single point in a. brilliant and fasclnat-'
ing game of ball. Pretty, plays; and
fcounding base hits were there in plenty,
and the result was always in the balance-
The score was 6 to 5, and the PonlCs were
first because they played together in bet
ter style and also because the Oakland's
errors were costly.
Danny Shay and the old favorite, Tacks
Parrott, paraded in Pony duds and wens
given the noisy hand by the crowd. Their
I'rcsence seemed to inspire the locals
with that vim and confidence that has
been lacking for so long, and the whole
team presented a front which surpassed

passing the club house turn, and did lead
Otis a neck or less for an eighth of a
mile.- After this great spurt on Glen

was never bothered, winning cleverly. The

put up with considerable abuse from
Evans, but that patience ceased to be a
virtue when he whipped her for not chop
ping wood when she was unable to do so.
Mrs. Evans explained to Justice Henry
T. Morris that the reason she refused to
rise -and carry out the woodchopping or
ders of the boss of the house, who was
resting in bed, was due to the fact that
she did not feel in a mood to swing tha
family hatchet. She stated that when she
asked her husband to excuse her from
starting the fire for once he flew into a
passion, slapped her face and boxed her
ears. As evidences of the encounter Mrs.
Evans exhibited several bruises, which
she asserted were inflicted by her anti

"A Madrigal" by Harris, and (b) "If

At 6 o'clock a supper was served on tho

The garden party at Mrs. Laura Al

most delightful affair and well deserved
the excellent patronage it received. It
was given for the benefit of the King's

land and the Presbyterian Chinese Girls*
Rescue Home in San Francisco. Among
the visitors to-day were a large number
of people from across the bay.
Great Chinese lanterns and umbrellas
lent color' and picturesqueness to the gar
den scene and the large cherry trees heav
ily laden with fruit added to the rural
effect. Under a gorgeous umbrella Mrs.
A. J. Irwin and Miss Laura McKnlght
sold baskets of luscious cherries. In the
candy tent, which was bright with pink
blossoms, pretty girls in pink and white
were in attendance.
A piano had been placed on the portico
in front of the house and during the af
ternoon an unusually Interesting and
unique programme was given. A number
of Chinese children from the home in San
Francisco gave some musical selections
that were much enjoyed. The star per
formers were two little tots, each aged
four years, who in response to the popu
lar demand sang a number of Ameri
can songs, among them being "Suanea
River," "My Old Kentucky Home," and
"The Old Oaken Bucket." The singing:
of "The Rosary" by Suey Leen, a young:
Chinese girl with a beautiful mezzo-so
prano, was also a popular feature of the
programme.
Choy Duck, a musical artist, played all
the popular American airs on three or
four different Chinese Instruments.
There was also a chorus of Chinese
voices. Professor Charles F. Graeber and
his mandolin and guitar club from San
Francisco gave several pleasing selec
tions, William Jackson played the banjo
and Dr. Maude Noble was heard in two
delightful trombone solos, "Out on thr

Judge Hall granted divorces to William
H. May from Adelia May and to E. H.
Chaumetto from Emile Chaumetto, both
on the gTOund of desertion.
Judge Ogden believed the wife's Btory,
but refused to give her a divorce because
ehe had not made out a strong enough
case. He eaid, however, that any man
who would strike a woman was a brute
and fit for chastisement. The case went
over until Tuesday for further testimony
la behalf of the husband. Attorney M- C.
Chapman for the wife did not want the
case delayed i>ecause both parties to the
controversy are destitute, and he volun
teered to relinquish his fee of $3} for the

The couple were married in 1SS4 and had
one child. But the child died and their

three of the Berkeley students and three
Stanford students who had come into
Monterey from the Stanford summer
echool at Pacific Grove. The surveying
students claim that the Stanford people
erew insulting at a country dance at
vhich they were in attendance and thus
precipitated the encounter.
The constable of Monterey arrested
the whole party from the University of
California on the point of their departure,
although but three of them had been im
plicated. But he was a novice at handling
a. crowd of college youths. They allowed
themselves to be escorted toward the jail
as far as the railroad station, and there
they surprised the minion of the law by
boarding the train for San Francisco in a

The United States export trade In horses
has been growing in bulk and in value at
a rate that is as astonishing as it is grat
ifying. In 1891 the exports of horses were
worth about $1,000,000. In 1901 they were
worth about $9,000,000. Great Britain has
been pur best customer. During the pe
riod from 1895 to 1901 that country import
ed American horses to the value of $35,
000,000. These figures do not include the
trade In mules. From September In 1899 to
December in 1901 the mules sent to Great
Britain from this country were worth, or
at least cost, $6,000,000. The South African
war, of course, has Increased the demand
for both horses and mules,. but it should
be. noticed that the demand did not orig
inate with the . South African war. It
antedated that war by several years. It
was growing steadily when the war be
gan. '.Â¦ It will continue â¢ after the war is
ended. Great Britain, however, while our
best customer, is not our only one. There
are other â¢ countries where American
hcrses are needed. The distribution of the
export horses In 1901 is Interesting. South
Africa took 37,465; Great Britain, 22,698:
Canada, 8438; Cuba, 4436; China, 2317; the

ASTONISHING GROWTH
IN TRADE IN HORSES
190. It Is evident that the horse market
is about as wide as the world. It is also
a market that is wide in another respect â
it demands horses of all kinds. ;The
American exports have Included trotters,
pacers, runners, draught horses, road
sters and stallions for breeding. The tri
umph of the American trotting horse is
particularly noticeable. Almost all Euro
pean. countries have recognized the value
of the American racer and likewise of the
American trainer. Good specimens of
both have gone to Germany, Russia, Aus
tria,'England and France. The breed of
horses in those countries will be perma
nently improved. In all this there is a
certain amount of glory and a great deal
of money. .The United States has plenty
of prairie on which to grow horses, and
as long as foreign nations want horses Is
ready to supply them.

during the day owing Â¦ to the un
finished condition of the. grounds,
and the big attendance was expec

day. When it was discovered that the at
tendance began so early, it became evi
dent that it would be all that could be
asked for the coming week.
San Francisco is being drawn upon
largely. The city of Oakland is full of
strangers, showing that many have come
from across the bay, and from the in
terior of Alameda, Contra- Costa and San
ta Clara counties.
There was a (slight accident at' the
grounds to-day, which caused the im
mediate establishment of an -emergency
hospital.* Mrs. H. H. Hale fell from one
of the carriages of the Ferris Wheel.
She was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where it was found that she was more
frightened than hurt.
The Elks then appointed a committee,
consisting of Dr. H. B. Mehrmann, F. J.
Lea and F. W. Leavitt, to establish an
emergency hospital. A i space was se
cured next to the Fabiola Hospital booth,
and two cots were erected. Fabiola Hos

Chinese fashion, through the streets and
into the fair grounds. The clang of clm
bals and the boom of firecrackers marked
the march of the Highbinders and a great
crowd was attracted by th<? sight. Sen
ator E. K. Taylor, the great tong, garbed
in majestic silk robes and crowned wl^h
a gorgeous headpiece, directed the march
from an automobile. Dr. Tom Carpenter,
as Empress Dowager, occupied a part of
the automobile ar.rl gave the high signs

Through the very center of lower New
York Bay, to take the place of the -old
circuitous route, a direct channel Is being
dredged to a depth of forty feet.' The big
ships like the Deutschland, the Kaiser
Wilhelm and the new Kronprlhz, which
are forced now to await the flow of the
tide, will have regular sailing hours.
The digging of a ditch under water is
scarcely less interesting than the cutting
of a deep trench like the new subway in
New York through the city streets. In
this particular channel borings have been
made which show that the flnding of. rock
is decidedly improbable. Two great twin
screw hulks of steel, built much like long
rectangular boxes, with vertical stack,
foremast and mainmast, steam dally into
the channel's course, and the big suction
tubes are lowered and are sunk about ten
feet into the sand and mud of the bot
tom. The pump is charged, and the bot
tom of the bay begins to run into about
a dozen hoppers, which extend for 125
feet through the center of the dredge.
Meanwhile the boat moves forward at a
rate of about twenty-five feet a minute, so
that new material can be fed constantly
in the hoppers by the suction. When the
hoppers- are entirely filled the tube is
drawn up, the pump is stopped and the

general public was allowed to enter the

official opening took place, Mayor Bar

convenience and up-to-date improvement.
The vessels will approximate the dimen

The section of pipe that burst was thir
teen inches in diameter and about the
same length from flange to flange. Had
it been long&r the rip would have been
greater in proportion and nearly every
one would have perished in the hull.
Charles Lee. the chief engineer, says it
was one of those unavoidable accidents
that sometimes happen. His presence of
mind in shutting off the steam prevented
the victims from sustaining greater in
jury than they did.
Foreman Harry Dixon of the Risdon
Iron Works started to work immediately
to repair the damage done so that the
ship may pail according to schedule.
Finally men found their way up from
below and told the story of their, awful
experience. Their clothes were drenched
with scalding water and their flesh raw.
George I>e Brou was carried up first,
writhing in pain, and it was several min
utes before Callahan, Bandel, Carew and
Haines were discovered and placed in
ambulances. At the hospital everything
possible was done to alleviate the suffer
ings of the injured, and with . the excep
tion of Callahan and Le Brou, all were
sent to their homes after treatment.
VICTIMS' FLESH SAW.
STEAM PIPE BURSTS.
Without warning a section of the Eteam
pipe rent under the pressure and instant
ly the space was tilled -with the scalding
vapor. The break was just above the
steam chest, and about thirteen Inches in
length and half an inch in width.
For a time pandemonium reigned. As
the vapor and boiling water flooded the
place and came in contact with the vic
tims* flesh, their shouts and groans arose
above the hissing and roar of the steam.
Twenty men were hemmed in the small
compartment- The burning clouds blind
ed them and those who were not in the
immediate vicinity of the break groped
about to find some means of escape.
On deck the noise and dens; clouds of
steam attracted instant attention and the
same condition of chaos prevailed. Deck
hands jumped to the wharf and a stam
jjede occurred in the direction of the
gangways. Chief Engineer Charles Lee,
%vho was seated in his cabin, immediate
ly surmised what had occurred and mak
ing his way to the boiler-room, chut off
the supply of steam from the big heateis.
When the hissing of the steam ceased
the work of rescue commenced. The
sieara was so dense in the lower com
partments of the ship and where the suf
ferers were penned that for several mo
ments no one could descend from the
deck.
George Le Brou, an oiler in tne trans
port service, was ecaldec on the *ace,
arras and body above the waist. He was
horribly parboiled and after treatment at
the Harbor Hospital was sent to the P:c
sidio Hospital, tiio condition is such ihat
the physicians declare ther-j is little
chance for his recovery. William Carew,
second engineer on the coat, was badly
cooked on the face, arms ana chest. Wil
liam Struss, junior engineer, was scalded
Slightly on the lace, and Jamts Rlley, the
ship's plumber, received injuries to the
cUest. B. Callahan, machinist, and Ed.
ward Haines and J. A. Banue 4 ., machin
ists' helpers, employes of the Risdon Iron
Works, were also scalded. All but Jiiley
and Struss were sent in ambulances tu
the Harbor Hospital.
The Meade was litd up at ifii Folsom
etreet wharf and was undergoing repairs
preparatory to sailing on Monday. The
gleam gauge registered 12'J pounds of
steam and the feed pipes leading from the
boilers to the engines wore open. A num
ber of mechanics were occupied in the
engine-room, tinkering here and there,
and firemen and coal-passers were busy
ttowing away fuel.
Scadling steam from a feed pipe that
burst on the United States army trans
port Meade yesterday afternoon injured
seven men, one probably fatally and the
others seriously. Th<i men were confined
in the engine-room and when the burning
vapor enveloped them were unable to es
cape until rescued by other employes on
the ship, some minutes ialcr.
As a proof of the nutriment to be found in
the California, grain hay, the use of it by
pome horsemen in the East, I should think, is
sufficient evidence for the Government of its
superior quality. For the last four or five
years ' we have, been shipping. California grain
hay for very valuable racehorses. If the own
ers of *uch valuable stock did not know the
strength and untriment in it they certainly
would not have it brought from here tn prefer
ence to using the hay they raise at their very
doors. Our hay that sells for $12 here sells
for $25 in the East, but the Government could
ship any quantity froin one to 100.000 tons,
and for $12 it could be put alongside the veg
sel. But people in Washington and Oregon
have a stronger null with the administration
than have we folks of. California.'
J. G. Johnson had this to say In sup
port of his argument that the Government
can find no better hay for Its horses than
can be purchased in this State:
There is no trouble in obtaining all the hay
required on short notice. We can compress it
aa desire* and can to-day put it free on board
at ?12 50.
NONE BETTER THAN OURS.
It is a fact beyond dispute that our hay is of
superior quality and will Rive stock .more
nourishment and strength than the hay from
the north. Such has been proved by the chemi
cal analysis of some of . our most prominent
chemists, we' havlns submitted samnles of
both our own and the hay from Washington
for the purpose of a fair decision. Hay is gen
erally half and sometimes one-third the price
the Government is paying in the north for a
poorer quality. . No good reason can bÂ« as
signed why the Government â¢ should not take
advantage of this sreat difference, both in
quality and price, and purchase its hay In this
marUet.
Our Senators and Congressmen are evidently
not working as hard for our State and its in
terests as are the Senators and Congressmen
of Oregon and Washington for theirs.
Miller goes on to say:
Miller said that the officers in Manila
were mostly all Eastern men, who are
prejudiced against California grain hay
In favor of timothy hay, which, with
blue grass, is used altogether In the East.
Miller stands by the argument and as
surance of many well posted authorities
on the subject, and declares that Califor
nia grain hay is far superior to the tim
othy both in strength and quality.
On every hand it Is urged that the
prevailing price of oats in San Francisco
is much . lower than in the States of
Oregon and "Washington.'.., -Â¦ .'â¢
W. A: Miller, .of the firm, of -Miller &
Co. ,* wholesale commission deals in hay
and, grain, .said yesterday that the Gov
ernment in purchasing its hay from the
Northern may.cets pays about $23 a ton,
and he further declared, as did J. G.
Johnson of Benicia, that it could buy bet
ter grain-hay In San Francisco for $12.
GOVEBNMEtfT PAYS HIGH.
The Government frequently finda It
necessary to make up a mixed cargo of
hay and oats and as the timothy hay is
only obtainable in the Northern markets,
except at an increased cost on account
of freight, it may be that the Government
concluded to make its purchases of oats
in the same markets where the timothy
hay is obtainable.
The last requisition of the Government
for" oats was not advertised in -the San
Francisco market, but the reason may
be that timothy hay, such as the Govern
ment Is using in the Philippines, couM
not be obtained here and if oats anil
hay were brought to this market, it would
be the means of adding $2 50 or more per
ton to the Government cost.
Another reason given for the lack of
orders for oats Jn this market Is that :n
all probability the Government may have
investigated and found that oats were flot
obtainable In sufficient quantities to fill
the desired orders. . Now that, the new
crop Is arriving, it- is estimated that
orders can be filled shortly from this
market even under $135.
The exceedingly large purchases made
In the Northern markets by the British
.Government for South African shipments
have been the means of materially ad
vancing values in those markets, that
Government having paid. from $160 to?170.
The British Government has, however,
made some purchases in San Francisco
ar. about $1 45 to $1 50.
At that time, about a month ago, only
a small portion of the order could be filled
through the San Francisco market, owing
to the lack of Bupply of the quality de
sired by the. English.
MAEKET LACKS SUPPLY.
During the last two weeks the Govern
ment has placed an order on the Northern
markets for 1600 tons of oats, though no
houses of this city have not yet been def
initely advised that it has been fulfilled.
It is said that the prevailing price of
oats here is much lower than on the
Sound, where it Is admitted that the last
Government bids were $1 60 and $130.
whereas this market's .prices have been
anywhere from $1 30 to 51 50. Â£-.*';:
There are those who are connected with
the trade who do not believe that the
Government authorities are showing dis
crimination in favor of the Northern mar
kets, while admitting that big orders havÂ«
been recently placed at Portland, Seattle
and Tacoma. 'â¢Â¦ . Â¦
Several reasons are given for the neglect
suffered by this State, one being the in
ferior quality of the oats that had been
at one time purchased for the. Govern
ment in this State for the Philippines.
Some are inclined to blame the trans
actions of inspectors whom the Govern
ment employed, to pass upon the quality
of oats purchased and accepted from the
contractors, which, upon Its arrival in
Manila, was found to be not only unsat
isfactory, but such' as would not be ac
cepted â¢ from any responsible dealers in
the trade. . . Â¦â¢ ....
The report has been . current for some
time that the Government is purchasing
oats and hay from the markets of Oregon
and Washington to the detriment of the
State of California,. which, it Is admitted,
is being overlooked in that important mat
ter. Â¦;Â¦:"Â¦ t 'Â¦Â¦"Â¦'Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦

the point that a man has a right to at

he would read the testimony and authori
ties cited and render his decision next
Thursday.

covered with blood. She did not see the
defendant with a bottle in his hand, nor
did she hear him use any vulgar lan
guage. She saw Louis Fontenell. who
testified he heard defendant use a vile ex
pression, and had no hesitation in saying
that he was noisy and under the Influ
ence of liquor. The special officer had
his coat off and did not wear a star. The
waiter ran into the ladies' compartment

Chicago was quiet, with light support, and
any selling pressure there would cause a de
cline. Toward the close the market steadied,
and early sellers turned buyers. The Chicago
letter of Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. -said: .
"Market was a little easier. It being Sat
urday, there was some scattered profit taking,
but in the main with moderate stocks and a
dull outside trade, local packers control the sit
uation. Receipts of Hogs, 46,000, against 45,
000 last year. There Is fair demand for meats.
The demand for Lard Is poor."
An advance of %c In Hams and Bacon In this
market will probably go Into effect to-morrow,
as several local houses have already had their
price lists printed. This will put Hams up to
15c and Bacon up to 13%c for heavy and loo
for light. Lard may also be advanced, though
there was some Uncertainty about the latter

tor United States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended June 9,
is aa follows:
â¢The first four e>ys of the week were unu
sually cool for the season, with heavy showers,
and hall in come localities. Frost occurred on
the 6th, which was heavy In some parts of the
eastern section, and Injured tender vegetables,
such as potatoes, peas and tomatoes. The last
three cays were sunny and moderately warm.
They were very favorable for the growth of all
crop*, particularly benefiting backward vege
tables and ripening Etrawberries.
"The staple croj>s of the State are reported
to be in very good condition. Both fall and
spring: wheat have a good color and
stand, and In some places wheat has made a
rank growth. Clover, timothy and red top are
headed, end the prospect Is fine for a good hay
yield. Potatoes are apparently doing excep
tionally well this Eeason. Hops now require
Frr&ying on account of lice having appeared.
Sugar beets are being weeded in Spokane Coun
tv. Peaches in the Yakima country are now
being thinned. Fruit has continued dropping
in the -western section and it is v\ry evident
that the general fruit crop will be light.

NEW YORK. June 14.â Very little import
ance can be attached to to-day's dealings in
stocks. Prices were well held, but this was
not because there was any general demand,
but rather because there were no offerings.
Outside of Missouri Pacific and St. Paul the
dealings were hardly more than nominal. The&e
two stocks were lifted a point after the appear
ance of the bank statement, but neither closed
at the best. The closing was fairly steady,
jowever, but very dull. Tne bank statement
was considered favorable and helped the mar
ket. The buying of Missouri Pacific and of
St. Paul was of the same character as dur
ing the week and is attributed to the opera
tions" of speculative pools. The coalers were
neglected, owing to the lack of corroboratlon of
yesterday' s rumors of measures taking which
would end the strike. The rise of a point in
Norfolk and Western was based upon the re
ports that the strike of the soft coal miners in
the Virginias had been broken. There was
nothing in the day's crop news to stimulate
speculation. The trading was pertunctoiy
tnroughout. The favorable reports of mer
cantile agencies, which showed the anthracite
strike to be the only cloud on the industrial
horizon and a showing of railroad earnings for
the first week in June which are larger by
r over O per cent than those- of the eame period
last .year, were inlluences toward conserving
the firm undertone of stocks.
There has been a slignt revival in the stock
market this, week, but it . .was not husbanded
and the market has shown a disposition to re-
Juj.fce into lethargy and to await clearing up
of some of the elements of uncertainty in the
situation. Tne midweek Increase in activity
was due largely to a personal element and was
attributed to the operations of the leader of
the Bo-called Western party, which has domi
nated all the recent speculative movements in
the stock market and has been largely Influen
tial as well in the cirn market. Tne return of
this leader to the Wall street district was fol
lowed by large dealings in some of the granger
roads and in some of the Southern railroads.
This leadership induced some professional fol
lowing, but the inertness of the outside public
discouraged the campaign and it was discon
tinued to all appearances. The developments
during the week have been such as to dis
couiage speculative activity, but have con
firmed the general confidence that is felt in
the general soundness of the business and in
dustrial situation. The continuance of the labor
trouble in the anthracite regions has kept at
tention focused on this phase of the industrial
situation. The differences between miners and
operators have defined themselves as appar
ently irreconcilable and the conviction is gen
eral that the struggle must settle down into
a test of endurance. A posible spread by sym
pathy into Â¦ the soft coal regions has been the
further development upon which conjecture
rests. Another question yet to be answered,
which hangs over the situation, is the ultimate
effect upon the financial situation of the peace
in South Africa. The Stock Exchange settle
ment in London this week ' has revealed an
over-bought condition of securities, especially
of Kaffir mining stocks and the weakness of
many of the holders has necessitated realiz
ing and has kept prices in London on the down
ward grade. Not much revival Is expected in
England before the coronation festivities are
finished. A long period of liquidation in Europe
has ehaken securities down to a substantial
basis which may prove attractive to capital.
The present condition In this country is one of
expansion, if not of inflation. ' but the field for
new development in this country is clearly out
of all proportion yet to that of the older coun
try. Even decreaee in acreage of spring wheat,
which brings down the estimates for the total
crop, in spite of the high condition of spring
wheat The great importance of the corn crop
has thereby increased. Some anxiety has also
been felt over the cotton crop's need of rain.
Railroad earnings have been well maintained
at a level above last year, and the Industrial
situation has continued prosperous and es
pecially 6O in iron and steel, in which the
demand has continued to extend Into next
year's period. The increase in dividends on

CHICAGO, June 14. â Late selling developed
the only activity that the wheat pit experienced
to-day. At the outset cables were lower. Indi
cating better weather In France and England.
The Southwest Bold liberally In spite of the
fact that the country still had a soggy blanket
spread over it and more rains were falling.
Commission houses took- a little stuff on the
score that not since the Letter deal have there
been such clear indications that stocks of old
wheat are practically exhausted. A belief then
seemed to take hold of the crowd that fine
weather was at hand. Private telegrams
buoyed bears up to this opinion' and when the
leading elevator interest began selling very
freely the crowd was sure a reaction was set
ting in. All this ' while the pit was very dull.
As the selling progressed a gradual decline
ensued and July, which had opened unchanged
to V&c lower at 72%@72%c, slumped to a weak
close, %@%c lower, at 71%@71%c.
Corn was exceedingly dull, even for Satur
day. In spite of the lifeless nature of the pit,
however, corn held very firm. July closed
strong, %@V4c up, at 63%c.
Oats were steady early, but trade was slow.
July closed easy, %c lower, at 39%c.
Provisions were so dull that the market was
featureless but weak. All July products closed
7%c lower. '
The leading futures ranged as follows:

The president of the Fullerton Walnut As
sociation says there will be a shortage in, the
Walnut crop In Fullerton and Rivera, the two
leading Walnut sections of Southern California,
of at least 25 per cent. Leading producers say
they are going to hold out for 12 cents per
pound for the entire output this season.

The fruit outlook almost everywhere except
In California seems to be steadily growing
more unfavorable.^ The Government report
appears in the first column. Prune crop reports
are now coining In from the different sources
and indicate very moderate yields In Oregon
and Washington, and about one-third of an
average crop in France, where cold rains, high,
winds, frosts and a backward spring have cut
down the yield considerably. The California
Fruit Grower estimates the Santa Clara Val
ley Prune crop at from 60,000,000* to 85,000,000
lbs, according to different localities, which la
considerably below the average and far below
a full yield. As for the other fruits, never
before in the history of the trade in this State
have the primary markets been so closely
cleaned up as .this year. The yields of Honey
and Walnuts are also shorter, than expected.
Reports from San Diego County state that the
outlook for the Honey crop i3 very poor, ow
ing to unfavorable weather.
Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
celpt3 of Callfornian were very large and deal
ers look for a weaker market during the en
tulng. week. The appearing quotations were
generally obtained when sales were made.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs,
Butter Is no lower, but the market Is heav
ily stocked and weak, and close buyers get
concessions from"* sellers without much diffi
culty. Cheese stands aa before. Eggs are also
weak, and sales at' 21c are the exception and
by no means the rule. There are plenty of
Eggs on the market, and dealers are selling,
even, if concessions are necessary to make the
sales.
Receipts were 6S.400 pounds, 105 cubes and
20 kegs of Butter. 1232 cases of Eggs,
cases of Eastern Eggs, 8600 pounds of Cali
fornia Cheese and 10,500 pounds of Eastern

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. '
Choice Strawberries met ; with prompt sale
at full figures, but there was some poor stock
sold below quotations. Raspberries and Black
berries were In good condition and sold at bet
ter prices. Logans and Gooseberries were dull
at the quotations. Currants were In free sup
ply and the large offerings of poor stock weak
ened the market. The cannen secured some
at $2 25 per chest.
The demand for Cherries was brisk, but aa
offerings were large dealers were satisfied to
clean up at previous prices. The canners
bought heavily at prices within the quoted
range.
A crate of Thompson. Seedless Grapes came
In from Indlo and sold for ?5. This is the
first year of late In which California grown
Grapes were received in the market before the
Arizona product. Two crates of Nutmeg Mel
ons came in from Indio, but were received too
late to be sold. Nutmegs from Arizona sold
slowly at the quotations, but Figs met with
prompt sale.
Deciduous fruits were in liberal supply and
there was a steady Inquiry for shipping stock
\ for the Northern steamer, out to-day. Only
ripe offerings brought the top quotations. Cit
j rus fruits showed no change worthy of note,
j It is pretty early yet to talk about the price
of Grapes, but it is reported that Sonoma
: growers have refused bids of $20@22 per ton.
The Government fruit report will be seen In
the first column. It shows the condition of
fruit In the United States to be unfavorable
on the whole. .

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, June 14. â The weekly state

Loans, $881,670,400; decrease, $3,196,500.
Deposits, $943,868,000; decrease, $3,097,900.
Circulation, '$31,410,800; decrease, $55,600.

Reserve, $249,019,500; Increase, $1,259,800.
Reserve required, $235,717,150; decrease.
$756,975. ' â¢ â¢ . - â¢â¢Â¦ Â¦ .
Surplus, $13,302,350; increase, $2,016,775
The New York Financier this week says:
The official statement of the New Yopk as
sociated banks for last week Ehowed a gain
of $1,259,600 in cash. ! This amount very nearly
agrees with the estimated gain, which was
based upon the traceable movements of money
during the week, the difference between the
actual and the estimated amounts being only
$75,300. The loans were decreased $3,196,500,
reflecting the comparatively limited business
on the exchange during the week and also
the absence of important syndicate operations.
The sterling loans which were effected last
week were with private bankers and institu
tions other than banks and therefore they
were not shown in the statement. The de
posits show a decrease of $3,027,000. whereas
the reduction in loans less the Increase in cash
called for a net diminution of $1,936,700 In de
posits; the statement is therefore technically
out of proof. The discrepancy may I in part
be accounted for by the average of payments
for the Webb-Meyer settlements during the
week, Â«which disbursments are reported to have
amounted to about Â¦ $2,000,000. The required
reserve was reduced by $756,975, which sum,
added to the gain In cash, makes $2,010,775
Increase in surplus reserves; this Item therefore
now stands at $13,302,350, against $8,7S2,125
at the corresponding date a year . ago. ' The
daily, average of '. the week's clearings was
$132,000,000, whereas in the previous week
this average was $207,000,000. The clearings
on Â¦ Saturday, representing Friday's business,
were, however, $201,000,000, this reflecting: the
improvement In speculation on â¢ the exchange
which was observable toward the end of the
week. Comparisons of loans of , the principal
banks with those in the previous week's state
ment show that seven of these Institutions re
duced this Item $3,900,000 net; one bank in
creased its loan $2,400,000 and another shows
a decrease of $2,000,000, â¢ while another shows
a reduction of $1,500,000. . The returns of
specie by five banks indicate a net loss of
$300,000. One bank gained $3,400,000 and an
ather lost $2,400,000.

But the Prime . Minister trembled when
he heard these words, and he said to his
master. "I am troubled, my heavenly
sovereign, by this terrible message. Con
tinue, I pray, to play the august lute."
The Emperor Chua comenced, to play
softly; gradually the sound died away,
all was: still. They.held a light to his
face and saw that he was dead. But
the Empress put herself at the head of
her fleet, invaded the land of gold and
silver with her warriors, and soon made
the three kingdoms of Korea tributary
to Japan.
These things happened, we are told, in
the year 201 A. D., and the story of the
valiant empress is as familiar to a Jap
anese as is that of Boadicea to ourselves.

, Then the god was filled with anger, and
again he moved Â¦ the Empress to proph
esy. You are not fit," she said, "to rule
this empire. Go. the- one road." '.
Seventeen centuries ago the ( Japanese
Emperor Chuai was playing a lute in the
presence of his wife and Prime Minister.
Whether on account of the music or
from some other cause, the Empress be
came inspired with a divine afflatus and
began to utter the thoughts put into her
mind by the Deity. "There is a land- to
the westward," she exclaimed, "and in
that land is abundance of treasure, gold
and silver, dazzling to look upon. This
land I will now. bestow upon you."
The gmperor pushed away his lute. "If
you -go' up -to a high place and look
towarcP~the west," he said, "there is no
land to be seen, but only the great
waters. . They are lying spirits who are
talking to you.'' ....

He was always philosophical over his
business reverses. Of late he had estab
lished his right to several legacies, which
unfortunately he rHrf not live to enjoy.
Damon was a wholesaler and jobber in
boots and shoes up' to the tim^of the big
Boston fire in 1873. He conducted a whole
sale store on Milk street, just in the rear
of. the famous Old South Meeting House.
There he inaugurated the original idea of
sending all his goods C. O. D., refusing to
open accounts with any of his customers.
He acknowledged In after years, however,
that this was a mistake. During the early
sixties his business flourished, and Mr.
Damon made considerable money on the
rapid rise in shoes. Later he met with
financial reverses and gave up the whole
sale trade. But up to the last he took a
very active interest in the shoe business.
The man who originated it died the
other day In Waltham, Mass. It wasn't
the C. O. D. system that killed him. Far
from it! He lived to be 77 years old, yet
he wouldn't say exactly, even up to the
day of his death, whether or not the sys
tem had been an actual benefit to him.
It helped him at first, no doubt. He wag
Henry Damon, an-i he was born in I the
town of Lincoln, Mass., on November 6,
1824. In one way or another he was con
nected with the boot and shoe trade for
more than sixty years, and literally "died
in the harness."
"When you get a package by express,
with a CO. D. bill in the hands of the
expressman and a lot of peculiar marks
on the goods, do you ever pause to -won
der, as you feel for your pocket-book,
how, when and where, or by whom, this
convenient system of doing business was
devised? Probably not. It has been in
operation so long that the present gener
ation doubtless fancies that it is as old as
business itselfâ or, at least, as old as the
express business. .

. At the recent local council election M.
de 'Launay was opposed by Viscount de
Kerguezec, and supported royalist'prin

A few years ago the proprietress of Le

that the paper should always uphold
"family, religion and property." 7 .'
