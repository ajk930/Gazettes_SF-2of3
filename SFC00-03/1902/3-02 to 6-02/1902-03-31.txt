combat doctrines contrary to religion, the
Pontiff condemns the forthcoming insti

The Pope invokes a union of Christian
churches as the leading remedy to save
society from violent attacks of atheists
and Free Masonry. He maintains trio
necessity of upholding the temopral rights
of the church, and counsels an active
spread of Catholic workmen's societies.
"Unceasing troubles and misery have
provoked people to anarchism, which
henceforth promises to constitute a for

Very Bad, This Man's Record.
Almost Kills Its ' Tormentor, While

Cheer Wildly.
EL PASO. Tex., March 31.â The usual
Sunday bullfight at Juarez. Mexico, was
accompanied by a somewhat unusual
feature, the goaded animal turning the
tables on the matador. Several bulls had
been brought Into the arena, but thÂ»
amusement they furnished was rathe
tame from a Mexican standpoint. There
mere many Americana among the spec
tators, who were somewhat disgusied
with the brutal show, as horse after
horse was gored by the tormented bulls
while- the picadors and matadors escaped
scathless. â¢
This was all changed, however, when
Jarllgo. the premier matador, was pre
paring to thru3t his long doublt-edctd
sword into the heart of the fifth bull tnat
had faced him. â¢ It stood in the center of
the arena, bleeding from many wounds
Suddenly the bull made a quick lunge for
the fighter. So unexpected was the at
tack that the fighter was unable to make
the customary sidestep, t
He was caught on the bull's horns in
the middle of the body and tossed about
like a toy balloon. Before he could be
rescued Jarilgo's clothing was stripped
from his body and his right leg and hlo
were severely lacerated. It probablv will
prove his last bull fight, as it Is not
thought that he will be -able to step hito
the arena again as a matador.
As the bull tossed the man high in the
air. receiving his body on its horns, onlv
to again toss it up. the Americans amoni?
the spectators cheered th<* animal loudly
which called forth a storm of hisses from
the Mexicans* present, and for a time it
looked as though there would be a colli

and a, large flowvof Irrigation water waa
turned on the- land. But the experiment
accomplished nothing. It was not con

The spread of alkal over the surface

Slowly but surely this destroyer of the
soil. has been spreading, -until .-at present
it threatens some of the best farms in the
colonies. In some of the lowest places.
In the colonies ranches have already been
ruined. Places that twenty years ago
were assessed at $200 an acre and were

Correction Hynes had declared his oppo

and the woman who has been so faithful
to him during his long Incarceration and
the exhausting tension of the long-drawn
out trial, made the Tombs officials more
alert to prevent a marriage in the prison.

been directed to make an Investigation of

President Roosevelt and Secretary Root
have reached the limits of their patience
with the commanding general.
General Miles is certain,' however, to
suffer further criticism in connection with
his plan for the pacification of the Philip
pines. In his letter to the Secretary of
War General Miles stated that the war
fare In the Philippines had been conduct
ed-with marked severity. This charge

There were about 2000 people at the
matinee and the performance of "Sag
Harbor" by the Pike stock company,
with Miss Collier and Byron Douglass in
the leading roles, had proceeded only ten
minutes when the portieres between the
corridors and the north aisle were seen
to be ablaze. The fire started from some
unknown cause in Â¦ the basement store
room of the Adams Express' Company
and extended up to the first floors, prac
tically under the auditorium, which is on
the second floor. A great volume of
smoke indicated there was a volcano
under the auditorium, but the theater
staff and the stage folk succeeded in re
assuring the people and all were got
out safely. . Â¦. . .
When the people reached the street they
found the whole. fire department of the
city playing on both sides of the building
and it required some time for the officers
to force Â¦ the . crowd , away. Many were
hunting for missing friends and it was
difficult to convince ... the half-crazed
anxious ones that there had not been a
holocaust. . A great portion of the women
fled without their new Easter hats and
the individual losses will be considerable.
The only thing burned in the theater was
a portiere, but- the auditorium was badly
damaged from water and it â¢ will not be
used again this season. The Pike stock
company was playing Its closing week. of
the season and had previously transferred
its scenery for next. week at Detroit from
the building. Manager "Hunt, however
lost $10,000 In scenery that was stored In
the lower part of the building. . The mem

CINCINNATI. March i SO.-The Pike
building on Fourth street between Vine

which was proceeding when the flames
broke out. The audience retired In good
order, but some women fainted after'
reaching the street.
The House during the coming week will
be largely occupied by the sundry civil
appropriation bill, which will be called
up to-morrow. Such time as remains will
be devoted to the consideration of the
Senate bill to promote the efficiency of

nese exclusion bill, both of which are on
special orders, but they do not 'interfere

I There are still several speeches, to be
made on the oleomargarine bill, but it is
the general understanding that the dis
cussion will be concluded during the first
half of the week, if not by^Tuesday, In
time to. allow a vote on that date. It is
expected that the Indian^ appropriation
and the rivers and harbors bill will be re
ported during the week. Both are sub
ject to immediate consideration, even, to
the extent of displacing other bills, . but
it Is not believed that either of them will
be used to deprive the | Chinese bill of Its
chance for consideration.
WASHINGTON; March 3O.-The friends
of the oleomargarine bill hope to obtain
a vote upon that measure upon Tuesday
of the present week, and. as soon as it
ehall have been disposed of the Chinese
exclusion bill will be called.'. According
to the present understanding, Senator
Mitchell of Oregon, who was largely in
strumental In framing the exclusion bill,
will make the first presentation of its
merits to the Senate. He will be followed
by 'other supporters of; the bill' and it is
the hope of Senator Penrose, who has
charge of the measure, that the Senate
will be able to conclude Its consideration
within ten days after it is taken up. There
is no pronounced opposition to the bill as
a whole, but an effort will be made to
amend it in some particulars.

BERLIN. March 30.â The Boerse wore a
holiday aspect during the past week, and
there were few transactions, . but quota
tions were mostly well . maintained. The
market builds great hopes upon the suc
cess of the outcome of the peace nego
tiations in South Africa and yesterday's
strong Kaffir market in Paris reacted fav
orably here. . Irons .were from 1 to 8
points higher. Coal shares were'like
wise several . points up, notwithstanding
the fact that trouble is brewing between
the coal syndicate and several- members
of that organization which threatens the
partial dissolution of the syndicate and
that coal operatives will be discharged.
The cheerfulness over the South Afri
can situation resulted, . however, in sub
stantial advances In home rails, consols
and Kaffirs. The general situation of the
South African section was little affected
by the death of Cecil Rhodes. Americans
were quiet but cheerful. Money remains
scarce, thus discouraging speculation, but
the large Government disbursements at
the end of this week promise temporary
relief. Consequently, there Is a prospect
of a considerable broadening of tne mar
ket after EaaÂ»r.
It is believed fhat the Chancellor of the
Exchequer will avail himseif of that sit
uation to submit a new loan, which, as
suming that the war continue, cannot be
less than Â£50,000,000. It is also quite cer
tain, unless the peace negotiations be suc
cessful, which few people dare hope, that
the Chancellor must fix the price of Issue
for the new loan at a much lower rate
than that of previous loans.
LONDON, March 30.â The knowledge
that the Easter holidays would close the
London Stock Exchange for â¢ four days
from last Thursday had a sober effect on
what doubtless would have' been a. de-,
cided outburst of activity when the unex
pected resumption of' peace negotiations
was announced last week. As a result of
this condition the enthusiasm with which
the news from South Africa was received
spent itself in two days and' the re
mainder of .the week was given to ad-
Justing accounts against possible con
tingencies before the reopening of the Ex.
change on April 2.
March ,30.â The Navy
Department has had under consideration
for several weeks cast the .cases of two
Chinese and a Japanesef enlisted in the
navy and charged with infractions of the
naval regulations. It was recommended
that they be tried. by a naval court-mar
tial, but the question was raised as to
whether these aliens could properly be
tried by the United -States Naval Court.
While the law officers of the department
are firmly . of the opinion that the Orien
tals placed themselves subject to the laws
of .the navy, when they eniisted In that
branch of the Government service, they
find that they -can dispose of their case3
in another wayâ by an old naval statute,
which provides for the discharge of per
sons undesirable for retention in the naval
service. The discharge of the Orientals
under this statute will not admit of their
.re-enlistment in the service, and the ac
tion of the department is intended to dis
courage the enlistment of foreigners in
the United States navy service.

"CHICAGO. March SO.â The Attorney
General of the United States will be

A committee of j Chicago club women was
appointed to-day to ask "Attorney General
Knox about the constitutionality of what
the' general federation proposes to do at

to Chinese speculators, who always buy
American gold at a quotation two points

duties in silver at the Government rate of
$3 27.
The employes of the Civil Government
are elated at the new rate of exchange,
as it means a considerable, increase in
their salary. It is the intention of* tha
commission to endeavor to retain the gold

I bring you the apostolic greeting of Easter:
"He is risen." la the festivals of the church
this day is the brightest ' gem of the crown,
and to the church meet Important is the truth
It brines. If the Easter message be not true.
Usen the whole fabric Â«f Chrlstion doctrine
falls tfc the srround. - "Our faith is vain."-
Hut fortunately tfifs cfentral troth In redemp
tive work of Christ is buttressed by so many
incontrovertible facts * that no unprejudiced
mind can read the record without beinjc con
vinced of it. Easter brinrs a message to us
concerning those Who have passed away.
Christ ts the first fruits ct all who sleep. .They
shall rise again., and shall greet us again. Go

BLOSSOMS TO GREET
A HOST OF VISITORS
SAN JOSE, March 30.â Santa Clara Val
ley and its citizens are preparing for the
blossom festival which is to be held dur
ing the week beginning April 8. The warm
weather of the past week has brought
out the buds and already the blossoms
are appearing and the whole valley Is
taking on a snowy dress. A week from
to-morrow, when the festival opens, the
blooms will be at their best, and a sight
of the flowering grove of fruit trees will
be such as cannot be witnessed anywhere
else in the United States. Thousands of
acres of trees are along the. . roads over
which the hosts of visitors who come to
the blossom fete will be taken.
The blossom fete has been an annual
event with the village of Saratoga, in the
western foothills, but this year the whole
county has taken up the idea, and with
the Improvement Club of this city at the
head It will be made an event that will
attract thousands of visitors from all
over the State and make the fete a yearly
county affair. The cold weather has
twice been responsible . for postponements
because the trees were backward In
blooming. Now the festival will surely
be held during the week commencing on
the 8th, and the people of the county are
preparing to . extend a royal welcome to
the visitors. Nothing will be left undone
to make every one feel at home and to
show them all the resources of the val-

had condemned him became his followers.

Those facts are known, of course, to the originators
of the reports concerning the ; King's desire for peace, :
but in the face of them they, continue to assert tliat
peace is in sight. It is claimed that. Lord Wolseley's
mission, to South Africa is in. the interests of peace
rather than war, for it cannot; be that the fiehi mar- '
shal is expected to take command and relieve Kitch
ener. .Wolseley is now nearly 70 years old and is ut
terly unfitted, for the arduous duties of such a war as
the one ; that is now taxing the utmost energies* of
the youngest fand most vigorous generals in
the army. . Such a man, while unfit for command in:
war, is, however, well fitted to act , as a special envoy
in the interests of peace, and upon that -reasoning the
supporters of; the peace 'policy : base . their hopes that
th'e King is ready to make an earnest: effort to put
an end to hostilities. H/HP!
; /it would certainly be a. wise act Vn the" part of the
King to. restore" peace even if -he yielded "some of the â¢
extreme claims of his Ministers. It would be, more
over, a sovereign, act that would strengthen; his 1 po-^
sition as a constitutional King rather than a ; mere,
figurehead ' on a throne, and it may be that Edward
does intend some such display of energy before his
coronation. At the present . time . the' whole matter is

All the reports of a truce- between the warring
armies and of the beginning- of peace negotiations
have been refuted by. later reports of skirmishes and
fights at widely separated points in. the field of war.
It is evident, therefore; that if there be any such thing
as negotiation under way it has not yet made enough
progress to reach anything like, a satisfactory basis
of agreement. So far, then, as the scene of strife is
concerned there is nothing to justify the expectation
of a speedy end of the . conflict.

'- The Russian volunteer fleet now consists of fifteen steamers,
the last one contracted for, named the Smolensk, having been
accepted. They range from 8640 tons to 10,700 ton3, six have
speeds of 19 to 20 knots, and they have all been built since 1894.
The Moskva, Kherson and^Smolensk are fitted with Belleville
boilers, . which have given satisfactory results, yet these ship*
are laid up, with no immediate employment in prospect. Tha
status of the volunteer fleet is . somewhat uncertain., as the
contract with the Government expired Ia3t January and may
not be renewed. In the event of failing to again secure thU
subsidy of about $300,000, the Volunteer fleet will find it diffi
cult to find profitable employment, as the steam tonnage of
Russia is more than sufficient for the trade of that country.
A correspondent takes exceptions to the remarks In The
Call's naval news of last Monday regarding the defects In en
gine designs in the British navy, j He points out, what is quite
correct," that steam trials are mgje severe In the British than
in the United States navy. It Is possible that the thirty hours'
continuous trial under four-fifths power of engines which have
not been worked down to their bearings Is too severe and may
account for subsequent defects, but the fact remains that there
are frequent cases of leaky condensers, hot bearings and
broken connecting rods. The Formidable, Abouklr, Cressy.and
Sutlej failed to come up to the requirements at their first
trials, but succeeded at the second. The Implacable had four
trials. The Hermes returned after one year's commission with
broken down engines and boilers unfit for further use. The
departure of the Goliath was delayed twice because of defects
in her machinery, and five of the 21-knot cruisers made barely
1040 miles in; thirteen days on their initial trips. The naval
maneuvers ; developed a number of "lame ducks, of- which the
Resolution, rated at 17.5 knots, has the record of 13% as her
best effort. The^ London Engineer, well known for its re
luctance to praise anything not made in England, stated In
April last, speaking of machinery plans of the United States
Navy Department ; "There are many features â¢ of ' Interest
about them, and we may add that, as far as Is known on this
side of the Atlantic, the machinery of the American navy is,
as a rale, successful in no stinted measure."

CHIEF. CONSTRUCTOR BOWLES has written a letter
. : to Secretary Long protesting against the adoption of
. the metric system of weights and measures. He. points
. out that the plans of all the ships are drawn with
reference to English units, and should the French
system : be adopted these plans would become nearly val
ueless." -'Â¦', Mr. .' Bowles says 'the -American designer and
his workmen "think" in feet and inches, tons and pounds,
and their mental , habit- is entirely upset when 'they are
required';to work 'with meter, and grain. It -must be" admitted
that a change from feet and inches to meters and its decimal
parts will cause some temporary inconvenience to the "think
ing" designer and workman. It was at one time the custom
"of expressing measurements in feet, inches and fractions, such
as four feet three and . nine-sixteenths inches large or small.
This cumbersome 'and inaccurate.. "way has been superseded by
expressing the same measure of length in feet and decimals,
and works well. That workman who was. sent to measure the
length of a plate and" returned with the Information that its
length was that of his stick, the width of a brick, a ten-penny
nail and his thumb nail no longer exists.? Ship plans and de
tails are usually, made, on scales varying from one-eighth of
an inch to three inches to : the. foot, and there is no difficulty
about-, having- : metric scales ' applied to those plans already
made. ., The metric system Js practically that adopted. by scien
tific and professional men all over'the world. Germans, Chinese,
Japanese and Russians have become accustomed to "think" in
meters and grams, i and . the America 1 !!;, designer and workman
;Will likewise: become reconciled to a change which Involves
much- less labor Â¦, and is far more accurate than the present
English : system. : -.

The delicate fine potted and canned dainties of Eu
rope in which epicures have long delighted, are as
fraudulent as the plain American canned chicken A
summary of the report, published in the New York
Tribune, contains this extract from the statement of
one of the experts: "It would appear from the re-'
suits of the examination that the fat contained in
samples examined. was chiefiy derived from beef; or
1-ork. It is something of a surprise to find that even
in a high-priced imported pate de. foie gras the tra
ditio'nal diseased goose livers have been replaced by
beef and pork. There can certainly be no objection
to such a substitution on hygienic grounds, but as:
a matter of interest arid fair dealing it is most repre
hensible. *;'? *Â¦â¢ There are manufacturers who do
not use fat; pork as a basis for pates, but the practice, j
The most frequent adulterations are in fancy
canned goods, such as fowl and potted and deviled
meats. It is noted, moreover, that in some cases the
adulterations are not confined Jo the use :of the pre
servatives, for beef,' mutton and pork are so treated
as to enable them to masquerade in a can as canned
chicken, while chicken itself is made to pass muster
as woodcock; pheasant and other fine game. This
seems to be one of the few cases in trade where the
poor have the advantage of the rich, for the plain
goods such as are bought by people of comparatively
small means are generally honestly packed and la
beled, but the buyer of high-priced fancy potted
meats gets nothing fancy for his money but a. label.
FROM the division of chemistry of the Depart
ment of # Agriculture there has jnst been issued
a report of the results of the investigation of
preserved meats.. The full report has not yet. been
received, but from the summary given in our. Eastern
exchanges it appears the general public would de
rive little advantage from it were it so generally cir
culated that every household were furnished with a
copy. The chemists, have made their examinations,
fairly and thoroughly enough, but they have stated
the results in such technical terms that few persons
except chemists can understand them.^ ; Thus it would |
seem that the report, will require translation before
the labor of the chemists will be of any value to the
pe6ple who have paid for it.
Chemical preservatives of one kind or another are
used in neatly all lines of the preserved meat indus
try, and the packers say such preservatives are neces
sary in order to obtain a uniform product. Some of
the preservatives used are comparatively harmless,
while others are dangerous. It is gratifying that, the
investigations have disclosed that American packers
and cannersare more careful and more honest in that
respect than their foreign competitors. The Gov
ernment chemists examined 359 specimens of canned
goods in our markets, and of these 290 were Ameri
can arid the rest foreign. Of the , American goods
only 6.2 per cent were " treated with preservatives,,
while 40.6 of the foreign goods were so treated.

' YORK. (Ph&to by Taber.) . '
In San Francisco the conditions continue cheerful.
Here business shows no signs of hesitation. The re
verse is raxher "the case. The most casual observer
can see that the town'is doing a large business by
merely strolling through the streets. The crowds on
the sidewalks, the processions of teams passing
through the thoroughfares and the- great number of
new buildings going up tell their story. The interior
newspapers, too, are calling attention to the pro
nounced influx of new people into the towns and
farming districts from the East. The best feature of
this is that for the most part they seem to be com
ing here to remain. If current conditions, continue
the next census will record a large increase in the
population of San Francisco. and Northern Califor
nia. Of course this means more small farms, -jam in
creased output of produce and more money in cir
culation all around In fact, this part of the State
seems to be having quite a boom.
PWall street is quiet. JJ"here are at present no gigan
tic new enterprises being floated, whereas at this
time last year the air was full of. them. Apparently
the great financiers find themselves, with all the load
they feel like carrying at present, and, indeed,. Henry
Clews, the New York banker, and one of the best
posted men in- Wall street, says that the only thing
that keeps stocks up at present is the broad
backs of the financial giants, who cannot afford to
let the market go down.
COMMERCIAL reports from the different sec
tions of. the United States were hardly as
rosy last week as for some time past. With
the exception of provisions most of the leading
staples showed a halting tendency, and the wholesale
and jobbing business of the country was reported in
diminished volume. The xetail trade, on the con
trary, was reported very good, and, in fact, above the
average for Holy Week. The bank clearings showed
a loss of 10.5 per cent, as compared with the cor
responding week last year, and New York fell off
20.1 per cent. The aggregate clearings of the coun
try, too, were the smallest for some time, amounting
to a little over $2,000,000,000, of which New York
*a* credited with $1,293,400,000. . The failures were
Â£S5, against 206 last year, but they were all unim
portant.
The exports of wheat, which were heavy a fort
night ago, fell off, and wheat itself weakened on im
proved crop prospects. Cotton also showed a re
action toward lower prices, recent excessive specula
tion having rendered the market top heavy, and the
manufactured goods were weak in sympathy with' the
raw material. Wool was likewise quiet, but the mills
were generally busy on previous orders. Meats of
all kinds were firm at the high prices, which are ap
parently maintained without difficulty, indicating
light supplies all over the United States. Indeed, it
is freely predicted by stock men that meats will never
again be very cheap in the United States, owing to
the curtailment of the great ranges during the past
several years, but while this may prove -true it is at
present mere prediction. The boot and shoe trade is
dull, with smaller orders, and hides and leather are
off in sympathy. The two lines making the best
showing are lumber and hardware, both of which are
reported unusually active and at good prices. The
iron and steel trades have been gradually quieting
down for some weeks, and while production and con
sumption are still heavy, a significant feature is the
reselling of some consumers, who find themselves
overbought for their trade. Clothing is dull as far
as men's wear is concerned,, but the ladies are still
buying new clothes right along as usual, for their
branch of the business shows no falling off.
HESITATION IN EASTERN TRADE.
â¢ That is the kind of contest now being carried on
in one of the greatest States - in . the Union. â¢ It : is
hardly necessary to point out that Illinois will have
much business of her own for her Legislature to at
tend to next winter, and it is desirable from every
point of view that the legislators be chosen for
their fitness to perform that work. Yet as we per
ceive they, are 'going to be chosen for quite a' different
purpose. .The dominant issue is. not whether this or
that candidate is- fit to legislate for Illinois, but
whether he will vote for Mason or some other man
for"Senatpr. Moreover, when the Legislature meets a
large part of its time will be given to the election of
the Senator instead of State legislation!. Surely it is
time to put an end to a system which produces such
evils as these.
At the -present, time the workers of the various
candidates are in the field pledging men right and
left to their candidates, and parceling out not only
State but county offices in exchange for. support for
the legislative candidate.
Discussing the methods by \vhich the 'struggle is
being carried on the New York Press says:
Methods of obtaining these pledges In advance of a
nomination to the Legislature vary. . â¢ Sometimes an ob
scure man, honest but ambitiousâ not always bothâ is
nominated In a close "district through the influence of a
millionaire, candidate who wants his vote for the Sen
ate and frankly says so before he gives him the nom
ination. Then a check for $5000 or 510,000 is sent to the
legislative campaign managers. . Every cent of.it no
doubt Is spent (in one way or another) to elect the can
didate, which is done. The legislator feels tied hand
and foot to the. campaign contributor, and will stick to
him loyally through a long caucus deadlock; and he
will not have much trouble in making himself feel that
he has not accepted a bribe. 'Another candidate : prom
ises to get a fine Federal appointment for the friend of
another legislative nominee or for the nominee himself,
and so wins his unfaltering support. ') He would resent
fiercely the suggestion that his course involved anything
dishonorable. In States 'Where bribery Is looked upon
as immoral orâ in aggravated casesâ as even indictable
It . Is a much safer plan than the Montana method of
open and conspicuous purchase of votes outright.' Also,
It Is more satisfactory; for, while votes bought coarsely
at the door of the caucus chamber are not sure to stay
bought, those delicately acquired before 'the nominating
conventions will be? enthusiastic and inalienable. \ Now
adays only slovenly ' maneuyerers ? like â¢ some of the
newly rich of political society; eat the. Senate : pie with
their knives. ' "' ' '. ' * â¢â¢ ' ' "'
The Legislature which 'assembles in Illinois next
winter is to elect a successor to Senator. .Mason.
The men who, are to compose that Legislature axe
to be elected this fall. A number of tirong candi
dates are eager for the Senatorship, and the conse
quence is the contest for the place, has already begun,
so that it is fairly certain every nomination, for the
Legislature made in. Illinois this summer will be de
termined not so much by the fitness of the candi
date for legislative work as by the alliance he may
have with this or that Senatorial aspirant.
WHILE the Senators are discussing the ad
visability of amending the constitution so
as to provide for the election of United
States Senators by direct vote of the people, a cam
paign is now: going on in Illinois which illustrates
some of the many detects of the present system, for it
dearly reveals the , extent to which the' election of
Senators, by the Legislature compels the subordina
tion of the Legislature itself to Senatorial . contests,
j with a consequent; injury to State affairs. â¢ â¢ , T

of which were taken alive. One alligator,
more than -eleven feet long, was killed
with three shots, and the young ladles

These are only two of their many ex

sunshine they radiate that accounts for
their being so immensely likeable.

Golden Gate avenue and Van Ness avenue, being
the principal driveways of the city, ought to be kept
always in a first-class condition for riding and driv
ing. Even if there were no throng of visitors ex
pected this summer to ride or drive along them, the
demands of our own people should be sufficient to
prompt the board to action. Mayor Schmitz has
shown a commendable earnestness in calling other

work, to show that they are at least trying to earn
the money they draw from the taxpayers, and making
an effort to justify the Mayor who selected them for
the office.
The members of the Board of Works must be
aware they were not appointed solely for the pur
pose of providing them with salaried and an official
position sufficiently high to give them a dignity equal
to the salary. It was the intention of the framers of
the charter that the members of the board and the
officers and employes of the department should at
tend to public work, and among other things keep
the streets in order. No vast amount of energy is
demanded of them, not- is it required for them to lie
awake at night to find work to perform. They can
hardly go out upon the streets without seeing before
their eyes some need of repairs or cleaning. They
have a considerable force at their disposal and they
dispense large sums in salaries. Surely it is but just
they should do something in the way of genuine
From persons riding or driving along Van Ness
avenue or Golden Gate avenue complaints of the bad
condition of those great thoroughfares are numerous.
In many places along Golden Gate'avenuethe as
phalt pavement is so lumpy and irregular that the
drive along it is but a succession of jolts and jarrings .
from start to finish. Van Ness avenue is marred by
the fact that the streets that cross it are not on a"
level with the avenue iself, so that there is always a
jar every time a carriage makes the crossing. Further
more, the streets are not kept clean and consequently
are often slippery as well as dirty, so that horses
moving at any speed frequently slip and fall.
The members of the board are good men indi
vidually, and it is somewhat surprising they should be
so inefficient as a board.. They appear to-be diligent
as officials only in drawing their own salaries and in
dispensing salariesto others. Some of the most im
portant thoroughfares in the city are so grossly negT;
lected as to have become well nigh dangerous, and
streets and avenues that have been especially .'de
signed for pleasure driving and riding are now in
such a condition" as render the passage of the most
carefully constructed vehicle, even when the wheels
are protected by pneumatic tires, a matter of any
thing but pleasure, to the occupants.
S ! AN FRANCISCO will receive 'many thousands
of, visitors during the coming summer. It is
estimated that the meetings 'of the^ Mystic
Shriners and the Knights of Pythias \alqrie will bring
upward of 100,000 men and women to the city. Many
of them will be strangers, who will see San Fran
cisco for. the first' time, and will scrutinize it closely
to learn how it compares with cities of the East. As
they will not remain long enough to enter' extensively
into our social life, they will necessarily judge the
city mainly from the outside. Their impressions will
be derived from the si reets, and they will pronounce
judgment upon us accordingly. Such being the case,
the people have a right to look to the Board of Pub
lic Works for a prompt display of energy in putting
the streets into' good condition.

These facts lend color to the story of
Harriman's connection with the project of
the San P^raneisco syndicate.
It is noticeable that the Mills syndicate
is not losing a day. in its work. Two strong
engineering forces will be sent out next
month. . One will complete surveys for
this year's extension to the foothills of
the Cascades. The other will run lines
through several passes in the Cascades.
The latter engineering party will be un
der J. J. Cryderman, . who Is more fa
miliar with the available routes through
the Cascades than any other engineer.
Next season's extension will be pushed
to Winthrop, Okanogan County, thereby
tapping the Methow and Okanogan min
ing districts-. This year's extension will
tap the Slate Creek and Mount Baker dis
tricts. The extension will connect at Spo
kane with the Oregon Railway and Nav
igation line, giving a through line for the
Harriman , roads to Bellingham Bay via
Huntington.. Walla Walla and Spokane
The Bellingham Bay Railroad has excel
lent terminals at Whatcom, the same be
ing nearly a. hundred miles nearer the
Straits of Fuca than the term!nals*of the
Northern Pacific and the Great Northern
Last year Harrlman sent Engineer V*'
Q. Bogue,- formerly chief engineer of the
Union Pacific, to Port Angeles to investi
gate the terminal situation there. It was
considered unfeasible to build from Port
land; to Port Angeles along the western
side of Puget Sound.
This State is now traversed by two
transcontinental railroads, the Northern
Pacific and the Great Northern. Just
across the boundary in British Columbia
stretches the Canadian Pacific. This con
sidered, it is unlikely that a fourth rail
road, would risk enormously expensive
building and tunneling through the Cas
cade Mountains unless .backed by power
ful interests as extensive as those of the
rival transcontinental roads north and
south of the proposed line.
TACOMA, March 30.â There is said to bo
reason for believing that the Harrlman
sys-tem of railroads either. has or eventu
ally will have some connection with tho
gigantic enterprise whereby D. O. Mills
of l^ew York, Alvinza Hayward and P.
B. Cornwall of San Francisco have de
cided to extend the Bellingham Bay and
British Columbia Railroad across the
Cascade Mountains to Okanogan County,
and probably to Spokane. ,

around the ship, looking for somebody to kill.
Fortunately for the passengers none of â¢ them
indulged in early rising. Martino, finding no
human game on deck, proceeded to the room
of Allmade. the second cook. With a howl,
which fortunately awakened the sleeper,' he
rushed in and . proceeded to Jab his knife Into
the bedclothes. Allmade got as far back into
the bunk as possible but held the bedclothes
well to the front. The bedding was cut to rib

serious wounds. From here Martlno went on
deck, dropped his knife and Jumped overboard.
His body was not recovered.

HARRIMAN'S HAND
SAN JOSE, March 20.â Registration of
voters for the city election Is progressing
so slowly that, owing to a dispute as to
when registration closes, it Is feared
nearly 2000 voters may be disfranchised.
There are about K00 votes in the city
limits, and although registration for the
city election, which occurs May 19, has
been in progress about two months, only
3500 voters have registered. This leaves
at least 2000 yet to register.
There is some contention as to just
when iegistration closes and whether the
State law of 1899 or the city charter is to
apply to the time for closing the regis
tration. The point will have to be settled
In court. Under the State law the regis
tration would close on April 8. but under
the city charter the itme would be ex
tended to April 23. If It should be decid
ed that registration closes on April 8
many voters will probably lose their
vote. â¢-"â¢;Â¦Â¦'â¢,

The Kilpatrick passed through a heavy
storm on the voyage across, and on March
17 shipped a sea over the stern that
smashed' in the hospital and made things
uncomfortable for a while for the invalids.
There were four deaths during the trip.
Corporal Vernon Thompson of "Company
D, Twenty-first Infantry, died on March
17; Private Wilbur I. Leake of the Twen
ty-second Infantry died March 24*/Pri

who was returning home with the body
of her husband, the late Colonel B. F.
Pope, died March 19.
Francisco Agcaoili and his brother, Ro
mario, who came on the. vessel, are na
tives of the Philippines, and have been
brought here to receive an. American edu
cation. The Kilpatrick was. thirty days
from Manila and twenty-one days from
Nagasaki. Among the passengers were:
The United States army transport Kil
patrick arrived yesterday from Manila
with the headquarters band and four
companiesâ 15, F, O and Hâof the Seven
teenth United States Infantry on board. In
addition, there were four casual com
panies, ninety invalids and four insane pa
tients. The transport brought Q21 passen
gers altogether. Among them were a
number; of army families, a few (school
teachers and two native Filipinos, who
have been brought here to be educated.
There were also fourteen jackies and ma
rines from the ships on the Asiatic sta
tion.
"I am sanguine," said Chief Wittman
yesterday, "that the Supervisors will seÂ«
the wisdom of keeping the force up to It3
full strength, and I will use every effort
toward that end. . We are behind other
cities in the number of men according to
the population,, and this being a cosmo
politan city is the more reason' why we
should not be hampered by the lack of
men. I am anxious to see the eight-hour
system introduced, although it will not
help me personally, as I have to be here
all the time. In other large cities there
are inspectors who rank next to the Chief
and take charge during his absence from,
duty, and there should be at least two in
spectors here. I think the Police Com
missioners have the power under section
1, article 8 of the charter to appoint in
spectors, but that is a matter for their
consideration."
One of the new lieutenants would be
stationed at the Potrero and the other at
the Park station, his district to Include
the Park and the Richmond and Sunset
districts. The others are required in iha
Southern and Harbor districts.
On the same lines eleven lieutenants
would be required, instead of six, as at
present, and an additional captain. Two
captains are needed now â one to fill the
vacancy caused by the retirement of Cap
tain Glllin and another to fill the place
vacated by Chief Wittman.
The force at present consists of 505 men
of all ranks, but according to the popu
lation it should be 6S4. With this increased
force the Chief could at once Inaugurate
the eight-hour system, which, with the
existing force, has been found to be Im
practicable.
Believing that the Supervisors will place
the force on a proper footing in regard
to numbers, the Chief has included in the
estimates seventy corporals and sixty ser
geants. At present there are only twelvo
corporals and forty-five sergeants. The
increase in the number of sergeants would
be necessary because of the Increase in
the number of men, but the very largs
increase in the number of corporals is due
to the fact that a reform would be in
stituted in making corporals do active
street duty. They would assume the same
duty as roundsmen In the large Eastern
cities. They would go out with a squad
of men and leave each on his beat, ami
when reporting off they would take each
man from his beat and march with them
to the station. During the eight-hour
watch they would be under the direction
of the sergeant of the district to which
they are assigned. The Chief thinks the
time "has arrived in the history of the city
when this much-needed reform should be
instituted.
The introduction of the eight-hour sys
tem for policemen and other contemplated
Improvements in the force will depend
upon whether or not the Board of Su
pervisor* grants the appropriation asked
for by Chief Wittman.

death after being wounded a number of
times in an ambush while serving on the
Island of Samar.
Captain Schoefel, with a detail of fif

attempting to capture a large party of
fnsurrectos. The officer, with three men,
was marching in advance, when the bolo
men swooped down upon them, and the
soldiers were overpowered by numbers.
The balance of the soldiers arrived short
ly, and a hand-to-hand fight ensued. Of
the party of fifteen brave American sol
diers, eight were killed, and all were more
or less wounded.
Captain Schoefel is crippled possibly for
life as a result of the fight. He has been

AT UNION CLUB SHOOT
This project la known as '. the Chesapeake
Western Railway. It begins at Gloucester
Point or York Harbor, Va., where a larga
acreage of land for a tidewater terminal has
been bought. The line runs northwesterly and
westerly, taking in the Chesapeake and West
ern Railway â twenty-seven miles built and In
operation In ths Shenandoah Valley. Virginia,
which is owned by tha syndicate â through 10O
miles of the coal fields of West Virginia to a
point near Parkersburg. ' Â¦
Construction work on over 100 miles of thÂ»
line westwardly through . the Shenandoah - and
Allegheny Mountains into West Virginia Is
now under way, with fourteen mile* of track
laid, and over half of the entire line has been
surveyed and located, estimates of construc
tion made thereupon and preparations are now
belne completed for general construction.
The line Is In no sense a parallel road with
any existing railway, but opens up new and
prolific â¢ territory throughout its length.
The greatest care was exercised by the
owners . to secure- an rcean tidewater terminal
that would be In every respect suitable for
handling the large traffic of a trunk line rail
way and Gloucester Point was selected.
It is of much significance that the west
ern terminus of this project is at Parkers
burg, W. Va., to -which city a line is now
being built by the Goulds from a connec
tion vrith the Wheeling and Lake Erie at
Zanesvllle. It is also significant that
George J. Gould, the head. of the Gould
interests, spent a week at Gloucester
Point last summer and is thoroughly la
touch with the whole situation.
PITTSBXTRQ, March 30.â A new sea
board outlet from Pittsburgh the Chesa*
peake Western Railway, Is assured, ac
cording to a statement issued by Joseph
W. Reinhart, formerly president of -the
A tchiscn, Topeka and Santa Fe, and who
Is now at the head of the syndicate which
Is furthering the project. Reinhart says:
It is not generally known, but It Is a fact
that before the Pennsylvania. Railroad ' Com
pany secured control of ' the tidewater traffic
through the purchase of ths Baltimore - and
Ohio. Norfolk and Western and Chesapeake '
and ' Ohio a number of men quietly took up
the project for the construction of a line of
railway from the Ohio .. River . through tha
Northern "West Virginia coal fields and Vir
ginia to the Atlantic Coast. This enterprise
has been carried forward and has now a
foundation upon which the whole structure will
shortly be erected. Â¦â¢-â¢â¢.' ; Â¦

NATIONAL GUARDSMEN
SHOOT AT SHELL MOUND
It is expected that several days will be
required for the drive. Business in the
farming and cattle sections will be entire
ly suspended, but those who will devote
their time -consider that their future re
ward will be more than ample to compen-'
sate them. Â¦ ,
When the proposition of killing the wild
horses was advanced it was warmly wel
comed. A drive of a similar character
was held years ago, but on a smaller scale
and with results that were so satisfactory
that there was little difficulty in enlisting
tne efforts of every one In the county.
> The plans, as arranged, are for con
certed attacks from/ each end of the
county. The citizens of Upper Reese
River, in the northern portion, will as
semble at Midas, and the inhabitants of
Smith Creek Valley, In the southern sec
tion, at Peterson's ranch. These two bod
ies of men, well mounted, will advance in
the direction of each other, driving the
wild. herds ahead of them. Many of the
animals will be shot on the run, and more
willbe driven into corrals constructed at
Intervals . along the drive. At the point
where a meetinc is expected pits have
been dug, into which the horses will be
run to their death.
For some time past the farmers and
stockmen have experienced much trouble
from the Immense droves of wild horses.
These animals dash wildly about the hills
and valleys, destroying crops as well as
scattering herded cattle. The horses are
of no value. They cannot be tamed, and.
In fact, cannot even be caught. Costly an
imals that have been In service for years
often tollow in the wake of these bands
and are lost to their owners.
It is estimated that between 4000 and
6000 wild animals will be slaughtered and
left as food for the carrion crows. Al
ready 100 men have agreed to participate,
but it is expected that twice that number
will aid in the drive.
AUSTIN, Nev., March 30.â Lander Coun
ty citizens will rid â¢ their neighborhood of
wild horses in a rather unique manner.
A big wild horse drive has been planned,
and arrangements for it are now complete.
The date of the great event has been set
for April 25, and it is exciting the Inter
est of stockmen in this as well as in other
sections of the State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Mogan was a most popular officer and
well liked by all who knew him. He had
been on the police force little more than
two years, having been appointed by the
old board Just before It retired, and was
always deemed an excellent officer by his
superiors. The deceased was a brother
of Charles J. Mogan, who Is now in
Alaska, and of Gus F. Mogan, a lieuten
ant In the Fire Department. He was a
cousin of Police Judge E. P. Mogan and
C. Mogan, a dentist. His mother and one
sister live at C02 Filbert street, while he
had another sister, Mrs. J. Kltterman, of
532 Lombard street.
The body was removed to undertaking
paj-lors. The funeral announcement -will
be made later.
The whole force is in,deepest sympathy
with the bereaved relatives. The dea-3
man's mother is 70 years of age, and it is
feared the shock may prove fatal to her.
Joseph A. Mogan, driver of the O'Far
rell-street police station patrol wagon,
was stricken with heart failure yesterday
afternoon while in the pursuance . of his
duties. About 4:20 o'clock a call was re
ceived at the station from Geary street
and Central avenue, where Irwln Fraser
cf 2931 Laguna street had fallen off a
Geary-street car and received injuries.
Driver Mogan and Officer .E. E. Dalton
went to the place with the wagon to re
move the injured man to the Emergency
Hospital. Mogan was assisting Fraser
into the wagon when he suddenly fell
backward into the street. His fellow of
ficer thought at first that he had broken
his neck, but as the fall was so slight
this was almost an Impossibility.
The wagon which Mogan had Just been
in charge of 'was called into service to
carry both Fraser and the prostrate po
liceman to the hospital. Mogan died on
the way. A superficial examination of his
body failed to reveal a broken neck, and
as he was a victim of heart disease it is
presumed that is what caused his death.
Mogan's wife, sister and mother were
Immediately summoned. â¢ .

The Alameda kennels' fast young grey
hound Merrimac won first honors in the
special stake yesterday at Union Cours
ing Park. Merrimac was in good condi
tion, and easily disposed of his opponents
until he met America in the final.
Geary's courser had shown better work
than was expected of him after his hard
winning last week, and twice brought
money to his backers, who had played him
on the short end.
The talent fancied Merrimac, however,
and made him the choice at odds of 2 to
5. The favorite took the lead in the run
tip the field, and scored three points.
America came into possession, and after
making a point picked up the hare for
the kill and evened the .score.
America's position; just before the kill
gave Merrimac's backers a scare, and it
was a relief to them that the kill was
not delayed. In the run-off Merrimac won
by a score of 5 to 3. A. J. Martin, the
stake favorite, ran a hard course with
Flying Fox in the first round, and won
by a score of 21 to 10. The severe work
unfitted the winner for further trials, oth
erwise the Alameda kennels might have
Jlgrured one-two at the finish.
Harlean Gladys won the open even from
Lilac, beating her pointless.
Tne Alameda kennels showed well in
the stake, the entries Clarice and Lilac
scoring heavy shcrt-end victories. Clarice
beat Cosey at 5 to L Gambit at 4 to 1 and
Santonin at 3 to L Lilac beat Royal
Archer at 4 to 1, Dewdrop at 3 to 1, Fair
Oaks at 5 to 3 and Haphazard at 5 to 2.

course of the puppy stake by a score of

The old. man had been quarreling at
Third and Franklin streets with a Mrs.
Wesley. Oscar Barrett, a young colored
man, interfered and, on Pantoskey's com
plaint, he was also arrested. Despite his
70 odd years, PanCoskey gave Policemen
Moore and Turner a hard battle, before
they arrived at the jail 'with their pris
oner.
Suspicion that Pantoskey was not right
mentally was aroused because of his vio
lent actions, but he did not become dan
gerous untii early this morning.
The old man had been placed In a cell
with several other prisoners. During the
night he quietly crawled from his 1 bunk
and tried to choke other occupants of the
quarters- to death. The jailers were com
pelled to bind the maniac hand and fojt
to prevent him from injuring himself or
others in the Jail. â¢
All night and during the day Pantoskey
was in a violent delirium and was kept
under restraint. His relatives, among
them a son, Jacob Pantoskey, were noti
fied. They will arrange to have the suf
ferer placed under medical attention.
The elder Pantoskey has lived in Oak
land for many years. He has been one

The vaudeville will be held In Harmon

misused, with certain circumstances that
may mitigate the offense so that all will
be well again for the young man.
Huston has served two enlistments in
the army,' making four years in all. Last
August* while he was stationed at the
Presidio, shortly after his return from
the Philippines, he became mixed up in
some affair in which he was accused of
stealing 1 a twenty-dollar gold piece. At
that time he was sergeant major of the
Fifteenth Cavalry, and without a word to
any one he deserted, leaving all his be
longings at the post. Two weeks after
his disappearance a commission -arrived
from Washington appointing him a first
lieutenant.
Huston had a splendid record during his
two years' service aÂ» a trooper in the
Philippines, and the commission was in
reward for this. He claims to have spent
two years at West Point, and his appear
ance and manner are guch as to entitle
him to belief in this statement. He de
serted on August 23 of last year, and (wo
days following he enlisted in the navy at
Mare Island. II Ik capabilities gained his
quick promotion In the new service, and
when he was arrested he was holding the
position of chief commissary at a salary
of $70 a month. s
The arrest was made at the ferry build-
In* by Detective J. U. Freel, wno wuÂ«
watching for the deserter to take the boat
on his way to Mare Inland. Huston nuyÂ»
he is a native of San Francisco and watt
born In the Presidio, ills father was an
army officer, but resigned when ha
reached the grade of captain and went
Into buÂ»lneÂ«Â». Of late years his home has
been In New York, but at present ho la
traveling In Europe. .
The young man claims that ho wax not
in hi* proper mind when he <JenertÂ«<i from
the Prexluio, having Just recovered from
an attack of fover contracted in the Phil
ippines, He says a conspiracy was formed
uKulnst him by some of the non-cornml*
sioned officer* at the fort, who were j'-.-ii
oun of hjs expected preferment and It
was mull' to appear that he had stolen
$20. Without attempting to clear hlmselt
of tho charge, he departed, and two days
later became u sailor. Apparently hÂ«
feels his present position keenly, but
hope* that his previous good record may
so plead for him that his commission will
not be rescinded. Short of this he U win
ing to undergo whatever rigorous disci
pline the military authorities may decree
for him in punlxhment for his desertion.
Behind the arrest of W. H. Huston last
night for desertion from the United States
army lies a strange story of opportunity

Mr, and Mrs. Siahey Drew lost none of
their popularity in presenting their latest
success. "A Model Young Man." It Is a
clever bit . of comedy, in which a gay
young man, waking up broke after a
night's hilarity, squirms through a bad
half hour with his Intended wife, who
calls at his topsy-turvey apartments â¢ to
borrow a "hundred" for grandma. Mr.
Drew, as the gay young man, does the
part to perfection, and Mrs. Drew over
- looks none of her art to make the scenes
as funny as possible.
Frank Lincoln, the globe-trotting hu
morist, confessed to having a bad cold,
but he managed to warm the audience
into several good laughs during his turn.
Paphit a, the charming fire dancer, entered
upon the second week of her engagement.
The Mclani trio of vocal and instrumental
artists performed with unusual clever
ness, but. during their turn a gentleman
sitting In one of the boxes fell asleep,
much to the amusement of that portion
of the audience who could not understand
the foreign tongue in which the Melanl
trio sing and more to the embarrassment
of the trio.
The other good turns on the bill are
Gorman and Keppler, Fred Stuber. the
banjo artist, and Louis 6imon and Grace
Gardner In their original comedy "The
New Coachman."
â¢ â¢ â¢
Al. G. Field's Greater Minstrel* were on
the bill at the California last night with
the usual minstrel Jokes and comical end
men. The show is up to the usual min
strel standard, the singing fc#lng very
good,
Reese PronBt-r. tho Welsh tenor, sings in
fine style. Tho comedy .of the play is ably
handled Vy Al. Field, Tommy Donnelly,
Mullen tin& Correll and Frank Fogerty.
Mullen and Correll are good as athletic
comedians; Donnelly and Fogerty shine in
amusing songs and jokes, while the
brothers Walton are dancing acrobat!.
Tho International Singing Congress,
composed of Heese Prosser, Joseph illazn
phln, Aubrey C. Prlngle, Thomas Me*
Kenna, Paul La. Londe, A. Fred Aelkens,
Addison Waltz and L. Diamond, sings
well. Altogether the bill is deserving of
patronage. >

"The Christian" will play another week
at the Columbia Theater, where it is
crowding the -bouse at every perform
ance. Hall Caine's great play is one of
the most Interesting theatrical works at
the day and an interpretation of extra
ordinary merit greets the auditor these
days at the Columbia. The John Storm
of Edward Morgan Is a magnificent per
formance. He is excellently supported by
a company headed by Miss Elsie Leslie.
One of the season's big attractions fol
lows "The Christian" next Monday night.
On that occasion will appear E. S. Wil
lard in his latest success, "The Cardinal,"
by Louis N. Parker. The play is eald to
be an exceptionally fine one and the cele
brated English actor and his company
give one of the finest productions of the
times. Willard will have lift his reper
toire, besides 'The Cardinal." "The Pro
fessor's Love Story." "Tom Pinch" and
"David Garrick."

The Grand Opera-house announces for
this week, the third of Melbourne Mac-
Dowell's engagement, another of the Sar
dou plays, "The Empress Theodora,"
with Mr. MacDowell in the part of An
dreas, one of his most successful por
trayals. The star will be supported by
Miss Florence Stone, who will appear as
the Empress Theodora, a. role In which
the actress achieved much success last
year during the Sardou season at the
Grand Opera-house. The piece will be
mounted with the care, nnleh, and even
splendor, that characterizes all the pro
ductions of this house.
The charming Martha Morton comedy,
"Brother John," will be the attraction at
the Alacazar Theater this week. The
comedy is a favorite wherever played,
and deservedly. It has a clear, amusing
plot, le Quaint in story, and lends Itself to
effective handling' by any company of
reasonable attainments. The Alcazar
Stock Company fehould do excellent work
In the play. Mr.' Alsop has the name role,
a hatter who has made money by the in
vention of a new shape in felt hats, and
whose brothers and sisters are given a
good time to their own way by their In
dulgent relative. They get into all sorts
of scrapes over their 'good time," and
are rescued by the ever kind Brother
John, who has meantime fallen in love
with his charming forewoman.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"The Bleeping City," a new four-act
" melodrama, will be the offering at the
Central Theater this week. The scene Is
laid la New York with realistic pictures
of the in and outside of Sing Sin? Prison,
Battery Park, the river and other places
of Interest. The plot promises sensations
galore, and at the rate of one a minute,
.and all the Central favorites will be cast
in the drama.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Any one who has bo far neglected his
opportunities as not yet to have taken in
"The Serenade," would better repair the
deficiency soon, as this week sees the end
of the pretty Tlvoll production of the
opera. There have been successes of all
kinds achieved by the clever people at the
Tlvoll. and it is all round as good as any
thing that the company has been seen or
beard in. Next Monday comes another
â¢Alice Nielsen opera, "The Fortune
Teller."
To-night begins the third and laet week
of the popular musical success at
Fischer's Theater, "L4ttle Christopher."
Iv'ew features will be added to-night. Fol
lowing this burlesque, the famous Weber
& Field plays will have a run, commenc
ing with "Fiddle Dee Dee," which ran

WE have for sale rights for the States of Cal-
ifornia, Oregon and Washington for the best
locked-wlre fence device ever patented. The
owner of the patent is a practical ranch man
j- who has 200 miles of barbwlre fence in the
Panhandle, and who is now going over, the
entire fence system of his ranch, putting in
the Etays with this locked-fence device. The
device has taken like wildfire In the Eastern
States. The State of Iowa alone sold for
$10,000. We have samples of the device at
i our office, where It can be seen. The prin-
cipal advantage of this fence device- Is that
it makes a fence that Is almost Indestruct-
ible; no power can move the stays when put
on with our patent fastener - and patent
Â¦wrench. If this device were adopted In Cali-
fornia It certainly would revolutionize fenc-
ing. The fence is cattle-proof, and by put-
ting In enough stays you can fence against
the smaller.* animals. The device can be used
on ornamental fences or for office wire work.
The - wrench and clips and possibly some
models of the fence can be seen at the City
Wire Works, on Main St.. between Seventh
and Eighth. Mr. Biescar. the proprietor.
will be glad to explain Its use. MINING IN-

Another Accident on Same Line Near

A Ban Francisco and San Hateo electric
car. in charge of Motorxnan \V. L. Davis,
struck . a hack containing two Chinese
women near Ocean View yesterday after
noon. The driver, according to t'he rail
way company's story, was intoxicated and !
was thrown to the ground by the force of
the eollieJon. He was uninjured. Neither
of the Chinese women was hurt. The ve
hicle was badly smashed.
The hack was returning from the Chi
nese cemetery, where the women had Just
paid their last respects to some departed
Mongolian. Approaching Ocean View, the
driver kept on the car track, despite the
motorman's warning: bell. The car was
coming down a steep grade and could not
be stopped until it had reached the foot.
When the hack was struck the driver was
pitched from his seat and the women, bad
ly, frightened, jumped out of one of the
doors. The driver refused to give his
name.

â¢According to the accounts. of the motor

due to overcrowding. The San Mateo car
waB returning from the cemeteries with
the usual large Sunday crowd, having
more than NX) people onboard. As it

but* the heavy load made this Impossible.
The Twenty-ninth-strcet cars nave the
right of way and the motorman on the
latter did not slow up, supposing that the
San Mateo car would come to a halt.
When it: was too late, he reversed his
gear, but the . forward â¢ speed of the car
was great enough to carry it across the
â¢tracks. It .struck' the San Mateo â¢ car
squarely on the* front- post and forward
end- and was thrown off the track. The
two motormen stuck I to their posts and
escaped uninjured. One' woman received
some slight Injuries, but was removed to
her home and her name was not learned.
The passengers .piled off the cars in a
panic,' but the men at, once recovered
their composure und assisted in the work
of rescuing Calle from the. wreck. Others
assisted in quieting the women and chil
dren and did whatever they could to miti
gate the horror of the occurrence.

Overloading of Ope of the Passenger
.' Vehicles Is Said to Be the i '
Cause of the Acci-
A rear-end collision occurred yesterday
afternoon on the line or the California
and Northwestern Railway, live miles
from Tiburon. Through ffood fortune no
one was killed or injured.
A train, heavily laden with passengers,
left San Rafael at 6 o'clock in the after- Â¦
noon. It was followed by another train, i
Â«JÂ»o crowded. While turning a curve out
side the long 1 tunnel, passengers on the
lirst train were horrllled to see a runaway
engine racing toward them.
â¢ Women In the rear coach screamed and
most "l the men became excited. One
woman attempted to Jump out of the win
dow, but was restrained by her husband.
A man became no excited that he com
raeuced Jumping from scat to scat. All
this- time the wild engine was com In it
cloncr and closer and at last, with a fear
ful force it struck the last car. Tin- shock :
and noise wore tcrrlnc. The steps and I
the back platform of the coach were de
molished and the headlight of the engine
was umiiMicii to pieces.
Gradually the train wan slowed up and
the panaengc-ni In the rear coach, who
were In a very nervous state from their
narrow escape, were taken Into a car
ithead. The engine wan backed up ana
finally trallle wus renewed.
The cause of the accident was a mis
calculation In timing the second train.
Jt had two engine* and when roundln* tne
curve the engineer, seeing the train so
clone ah. â¢.Â¦kI, applied the Air brnkea on the
cntrlne attached to the train. The leading
engine of the two had no air brakes and
the force of the nhwk In stopping the
train broke the coupling and started the
locomotive on its wild flight. Traffic was
ariuy&d on the road about an hour nnd a I
half owing to the accident. i
