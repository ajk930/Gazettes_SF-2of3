LONDON. June 23.â The tribute of
Count von Waldersee to the British army
in his speech at the dinner given by Earl
Roberts has been received with the great

his remarks are commented upon this

NEW YORK. June 22.â A London cable
gram to the Sun says: It Is certainly to
be regretted that it has not been consid
ered best to issue a plain statement of
the King's condition, signed by the at
tending physicians. Instead of this an
attempt has been made to create the im
pression that his indisposition has been
so trifling that it was no more worthy of
note than an ordinary cold. It is not
alone the untrustworthy rumors which
have aroused public suspicion and alarm.

NEW YORK, June 22.â Twelve hundred
silk-workers employed In the Hudson
County, N. J.. mlll3, met to-night at
West Hoboken and decided not to go to
work to-morrow. These workers repre
sented abou^ 50 per cent of all the em
ployes in the mills of that section. ThJs
move Is made to express sympathy with
the Paterson mill workers who are out.
The weavers are divided into two sec
tiens, one portion favoring going to work
in the morning, regardless of existing
conditions. It is pretty certain that,
should the decision be for a. general stop
page of work until the troops depart, the
shut-down will be long and protracted.
PATERSON, N. J., June 22.â There was
no disorder here to-day, though tHe>
streets were filled with the curious from
other places who came to see the militia.
Several houses In the Italian quarter
were visited by the police to-day, who
searched them for arms, but " the visits
brought no result. The militia is on guard
at the mills and some men of the detail
are stationed at the upper windows ot
each place, armed with rifles.
Throughout the Sabbath.

' Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary,
intended to be present at the dinner, but
was* prevented because of slight indispo
sition:
i Many of the privileged persons who
will occupy seats in Westminster Abbey
next Thursday will, se , little if anything
of . the actual coronation ceremonies.
Quite a number of the peeresses and oth
ers who were admitted to . the > abbey to
witness the recent coronation rehearsals
were chagrined to find how little could
be seen from the seats allotted to them,
and, in consequence, ," they have decided
not to occupy these seats, but to accept,
in preference, invitations; to view the pro

Earl Roberts concluded by calling for
a toast to, Emperor William and the
German army.
- "I can assure your Excellency that we
soldiers are deeply sensible of the kindly
feeling which prompted you to speak of
the army in such appreciative terms."
Replying, Earl .Roberts ; complimented
Count von Waldersee upon his distin

him in behalf of the British army for his
allusions to the work in South Africa,
Lord Roberts also said:

British Army, Count von Waldersee paid
a high compliment to Earl Roberts. He

The quarrel between "Oom Paul" and

Africa by Lord Kitchener and . tne Boer
leaders.. Kruger, as is well' known,: re

the Boer republics, and the feeble old

Meantime the civil authorities were
cemmunicated with and it was decided
to call out the militia. Seven hundred
and fifty mounted men from the Niagara
camp left Niagara with their horses to
night and will arrive at daylight. In ad
dition 300 of the Queen's Own, 200 gren
adiers and 200 Highlanders have been or
dered to parade at the armories. Sev
eral hundred extra policemen were also
sworn in to-nisht.
At the Dundas street barns another
crowd Intercepted the cars and they were
turned back, . The company then decided
to abandon the effort to-day.
The attempt to run out five cars at the
King-street east barns was attended by
scenes of the greatest disorder and vio
lence, several persons being injured by
flying missiles, including W. H. Moore,
private secretary to President Mackenzie.
He was hit in the face with a brick and
severely hurt. All five cars were badly
shattered in less than five minutes after
they made their appearance.
Similar scenes were enacted at the
other barns. An attempt was made to run
a car from the Yorkville barns around the
belt line. A big stone thrown against the
.window., dashed ;the glass* into* lictormaa
Johnson's face, badly lacerating it. and he
was struck by a number of stones and
was otherwise maltreated. Johnson per
severed, however, and made the circuit
of the line.
Several of the imported men were
roughly handled. This morning cars
were started simultaneously from the
barns at King street, Queen street. Tork~
ville, Dundas and Yonge street. A crowd
had gathered about the entrance of each
barn awaiting developments. ThÂ© ap
pearance of a car at the Tonge street
barn was the signal for hooting and yell
irg. The crowd called upon the crew to
desert the car. Their refusal to do so was
followed by a shower of stones and
bricks. Every window in the car was
smashed and the crew left their posts and
ran Into the barn.
TORONTO, Ont, June 22.-The first
attempt made 'by the Toronto street rail
way to run their cars with men hired to
take the places of the striking motonnen
and conductors was met with violence.
Only one effort was made to reopen the
traffic and the temper shown by the strik
ers and their sympathizers convinced the
officials that it would be Impossible to run
cars without strong protection. It was
therefore decided to appeal to the author
ities for troops and to suspend operations
until their arrival to-morrow morning.
Count von Waldersee and the German
officers with him were entertained at din
ner to-night by Field Marshal Lord Rob-
Count von Waldersee, one of the.Ger
man representatives to the coronation;
the Duke and Duchess ' of Aosta, from
Italy, and many other distinguished rep
resentatives of foreign royal personages
arrived In London to-day.
American flags were in evidence at a
great number of windows. Some hotels
are flying both American and British flag3
from their staffs in honor of the many
American visitors domiciled within.
The throngs in the street at night find
much to e,ngage the eye. The fronts of
many buildings are covered with lighted
decorations, and the Venetian masks are
covered with garlands and connected by
strands of roses. The streets\are filled
with many-colored lights, and the various
stations of the royal coronation proces
sion are marked with arches representing
British colonies.
STREET DECORATIONS.
The crowds out to-day were singularly
good-natured, and accidents were few
and of a minor character. The police
are distinguishing themselves even more
than usual by their courtesy and alert
ness in the interests of pedestrians. Ken
sington Gardens and the beautiful groves
about the Crystal and Alexandra palaces
are filled with colonial'and native troops,
clad in scarlet, white, khaki and blue uni
forms.
The congested condition of the streets
of London throughout to-day furnished
an omen of the conditions of travel
through these streets the latter days of
this week. The barriers across the streets
which intersect those through which the
coronation processions will pass and
which have now been completed are prov
ing an impediment to ordinary traffic.
To-day it was impossible to proceed fast
er than a snail's pace through the thor
oughfares between Hyde Park and the
Mansion House. The omnibus companies
have increased fares two, and three times,
and further increases in these rates are
probable. The obtaining of a scat in an
omnibus was to-day more a question of
physical than financial ability.

afternoon for the Sunday band perform

King and Queen listened \ to the music
from the windows of their private apart
ments. King Edward's appearance does
not justify the sensational rumors of his
illness.
King Edward's health was announced
to be good, at Windsor Castle to-day, and
this morning the King attended divine
service, accompanied by other, members
of the royal family. This evening he en
joyed a carriage drive thrqugh the royal
gardens of Windsor Castle, in a closed
carriage. The court will arrive at Buck^
ingham Palace to-morrow, ; bef ore lunch

The announcement that King Edward.
Queen Alexandra and the court .would re
turn to London from Windsor to-morrow
at noon increased the universal anticipa
tions for that day and served to quiet the
flood of extraordinary rumors concerning
the" King's physical condition, varied in
some quarters by : welrd tales: of plots to
assassinate the King, and other fictions,
all of which have been, promptly denied
by the officials most Intimately connected
with Edward VII.

When Agulnaldo fled after the battle of

General Wheaton, who was suffering
from fever during the whole campaign,
was very ill the day of the fight. In the

to leave his quarters. The general, how

the thickest of the fight, and he remained
there until the bridgewas taken.

On April 25 of the same year General
MacArthur moved forward against Calum
pit, and after a hard fight, in which Gen
eral Wheaton's command distinguished
itself, the American troops captured the
town. On June 8 General Wheaton re
ported to General Lawton and was di
rected to proceed to San Pedro Macati
and assume command of a provisional
brigade made up of the First Nevada
Cavalry, the Colorado and Twenty-first
Infantry regiments and a battery of ar
tillery. The command numbered 2000. At
that time the insurgents occupied all. of
the bay shore line from the present gov
ernment corral at Pasay to the Cavite
navy yard. They could be seen plainly
on the beach at Bacoor and Paranaque
by the aid of field glasses. The plan of
the campaign was to flank the insurgents
out of their position along the bay. On
June 10, the hottest day on record in the
Philippines since American occupation,
the troops moved out of San Pedro Ma
cati to Guadaloupe Ridge and fought a
running fight all day, the insurgents re
treating and the American soldiers ad
vancing. Three days later the battle of
Zapote Bridge was fought. This was a
terrific engagement, and was at the same
point that the insurgents defeated thÂ©
Spaniards with enormous loss in 1896. At
the later fight the heat was terrible, the
burning tropical sun beating down upon
the troops in a fearful manner.

' General Wheaton refuses to discuss. the
water cure methods, and says that such a
thing does not exist in the Philippines

his staff, consisting of Captains Charles
R. Howland, aid; Frank B. Webster and
Louis A. Bash.
General Bell did efficient work. The
troops under his command u-aversed
every trail and climbed every, mountain
in an endeavor to find the insurgents,
whose only idea was to keep out of the
way. During this campaign General Bell
Â¦was of untold value to General Wheaton,
and finally Malvar, a self-styled presi
dent, surrendered and the island was at
peace.
On, May. 19, 1901, General Wheaton re
ported that armed resistance in the De
Â¦partment of Northern Luzon had ceased
In Southern Luzon, however, warfare stil

putting down guerrilla warfare. His pol
icy was firm, but far from cruel.
He assumed command and gave the
enemy a severe thrashing. As soon as
the fisht was finished he proceeded down
the railroad track to Blgaa, where he
Then followed the famou3 fight on the
railroad track, April 11, 1893. The battle
extended from Guiguinto to Bocave, the
insurgents attempting to cut off tfie
American line of communication. In this
engagement the Minnesota, regiment was
Borely pressed, and a request was sent
to General Wheaton for reinforcements.
The moment the gallant officer received
the news he started on foot for the scene,
calling on his staff to follow him. As
he passed the camps of the different reg
iments he- personally aroused the troops
and ordered them to follow him. At 3
o'clock in the morning he arrived at
Guiguintoâ just in time to see the in
surgents attack in force.
With several engagements to his credit
General Otis soon recognized General
Wheaton's fighting ability. The Pasfg
had again been opened for navigation,
and General Wheaton was relieved and
placed in command of the Third Brigade.
First Division, Eighth Army Corps. This
brigade was not idle, and took part in
the famous movement against Malclos.
Malolos, the insurgent capital, fell, and
th2 Filipinos made their escape up the
railroad track.
HIS ABILITY RECOGNIZED.
When it became apparent that Aguin
a!do and his insurgent army would make
serious trouble for the United States
after the fall of Manila, General Whea
ton was dispatched from this country to
the Philippines in post haste by the War
Department. He arrived there, how
ever, a few days after the hostilites had
broken out. He was immediately assign
ed to the command of the First Brigade
of the First Division, Eighth Army Corps,
with headquarters at San Pedro, Macatl.
Later he was assigned to command i a
provisional brigade, with orders to clean
out the country between Manila Bay and
Pasig. General Wheaton did not allow
the grass to grow under his feet, and
he defeated the insurgents at Guadaloupe.
He followed this up the following day
by defeating them at Pateros, and two
days later captured the town of Pasig.
General Wheaton is in splendid health,
rnd the many trials and grave respon
sibilities that have rested on his shoul
ders have not effected him in the least.
His face is tanned, his eye is bright and
he still has the same hearty and sincere
way of greeting those who seek inter
views with him.

When the procession entered the church
not a vacant seat : could be seen. The
aisles, with the exception of the center
one, along which the acolytes and digni
taries made their way to the altar space,
were packed. The litany of the saints
was chanted as the marchers progressed
between lines of girls In white, wearing
veils, and on reaching the ' chancel the
impressive ceremony of blessing the walls
was begun. Archbishop Riordan officiated
in this beautiful ceremonial, and was as
sisted by Bishop Montgomery and Mon
selgneur Julius Chatron, Bishop of. North
Japan. This was followed "by tho pontifi
cal high mass, of which. Bishop â¢ Mont
gomery was celebrant. .. -
The dedicatory services began at 10
o'clock, at which hour all those who were
to participate gathered in the old church
and Bchool, adjoining the new structure.
Archbishop . Riordan and Bishop George
Montgomery, the latter of Los Angeles,
were the principal clwrch dignitaries
present.. Rev. Victor AciKter, O. F. M.,
of Los Angeles, one of the founders of
St Boniface Church fifteen years ago,

CHURCH DEDICATED.
The magnificent Romanesque structure,
the completion of which is a matter for
general rejoicing among Jthe Catholics of
San Francisco, was begun more than two
years ago. The cost of the sanctuary has
reached J180.000 to date, but it is believed
the finishing touches will be added with
out materially increasing the sum named.
The building committee, composed of
August Vetter, Bernard Meyer, F. B.
Schoenstein, Albert Matschke and Carl
A. Schnabel, was untiring in its efforts
to rear a monument worthy the parish to
which they belong, and ; the members
formally yielded up the fruit of their la
bor in the shape of a building that is a
distinct addition to the sacred edifices,
the architectural beauty of which is the
admiration of every visitor.

morning Arthur Devoto met with an ac
cident which necessitated the amputation
of three fingers of his left hand. The in
jured lad Is 9 years of age, and with his
parents had been camping at Occidental.;
With other playmates he was amusing
himself with- the machinery in the mill,
and hi* left hand became caught in a
cogwheel. So firmly did the . machinery
hold the hand that It was necessary to
remove portions of it to release the mem
ber. Young Devoto displayed remarkable
fortitude while this was being done, and
although he suffered much pain. waited
patiently to be released. He was conveyed
from Duncans Mill to Occidental on a
special engine, over the North Shore Rail
road, and from that place was taken - to
Santa Rosa for surgical attention. Tha
injured boy is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
A. Devoto of San Francisco, and has

curred, and campers at that place took

VANCOUVER, Wash., June 22.â Eight
members of Sheriff Marsh's possa who
left here for La Center yesterday to re
sume the chase for the escaped convicts,
Tracy and Merrill, -returned to this city
at noon to-day. The men report that
Guard Carson's bloodhounds after a lit
tle time struck the trail of the outlaws
late yesterday afternoon near the point
where they were seen by a man named
Dunlap, two miles east of La Center. The
trail led through thick underbrush down
the east bank of Lewis River. The dogs
followed the scent for a mile or more
and then lost, it, ..since which time all
trace of the outlaws has been lost.
Late last night a majority of the pur
suers returned to La Center after post
ing guards along both banks of Lewis
River wherever boat v were known to be
moored. There are threa suspicious char
acters around" La Center who. Guard
Carson says, are ex-convicts. They have
appeared there at different times during
the past week, and their actions attract
ed the attention of officers, who are keep
ing close watch on their movements. One
of them yesterday, after spending . sev
eral hours \on horseback in the brush in
the vicinity of where Tracy and Merrill
were last seen, started to leave La Cen-'
ter in a boat. He was forced to return
at the point of a gun by.Ferrell, brother
of one of the murdered penitentiary
guards. The men are suspected of try
ing to assist Tracy and Merrill to escape,
and they have been ordered to leave the
country.
Dunlap, who saw the convicts yester
day, says he was close enough to have
killed the outlaws, and, indeed, had his
gun to his shoulder for that purpose once,
when his wife interfered. Sheriff Marsh,
accompanied by Guard" Carson and the
dogs and four Vancouver men, are now
guarding the east side of Lewis River,
while Sheriff Huntington of Cowlitz

ached more painfully, and when I caught
cold the aching was greatly aggravated.
As might be expected- when the kidneys
were not performing their functions prop-

One seldom, hears of a vicar scrubbing
bis own church, but at St. Cuthbert's
lodge, Mlllwall, situated in the very east
of London, we find the Rev. Richard Free,
vicar, who recently explained to a repre
sentative hie scheme for spring cleaning
churches. St. Cuthbert's is a poor neigh
borhood, where the people sometimes
epeak of trees as things pertaining to an
other world, and where a hansom cab is
practically unknown.
"It occurred to me," he said, "as I was
on my knees scrubbing our own little
church, that there must be a great many
churches In London, which could occasion
ally do with a little more than the ordin
ary dusting and sweeping, and if only
they would pay us a small amount for our
services we are the very people for the
work. I can beeswax, varnish a chair or
polish a floor, and I don't mind scrubbing
till I get 'housemaid's knee.* My wife,
too, is exceptionally good at brasswork
and decorating. We have, besides, a de
voted little band of workers of men, wo
men, boys and girls, who can polish and
scrub, and would gladly give their ser
vices to benefit our church. I thought we
could have a suitable vehicle, and all go
down together, taking our own pails and
brushes. We will leave any church we
take in hand like a new pin."
Snails as Window Cleaners.
An old colored woman selling snails oc
casionally makes her appearance- on
South street, says the Philadelphia Rec
ord, and sometimes she may also be
found along Front street or Second street,
up in the district that used to be known
as the Northern Liberties. She carries an
old basket in which the snails repose on
freshly sprinkled leaves. These are not
sold as food, but for cleaning the outside
of window panesâ an old practice still in
vogrue in Kensington. The snail is dam
pened and placed upon the glass, where It
at once moves around and devours all
insects and foreign matter, leaving the
pane as bright and clear as crystal. There
are old-established business places in
Kensington where the tipper windows,
when cleaned at all, are always cleaned by
snails. There is also a fine market for
enaila among the owners of aquariums, as
they keep the gl&Â£s clean and bright.

feature of the evening, and consisted of
club swinging by twelve members of the
ladies' class of the San Francisco Turn

It must be obvious to every intelligent ob
server that the coal companies derive a con-
If their statement' be true, why Is it neces
sary to continue a system of docking by which
at times they arbitrarily deduct from a miner's
earnings from 10 to IS per cent of the total as
a penalty for loading impurities, for which they
have already penalized him in excess freight?
SYSTEM OF MEASURING.
1 In this connection the statement calls
attention to the fact that a ton of coal,
as the consumer understands it, is not a
ton of coal as the miners are paid for it â
that Is to say that the ton of coal sold
the consumer weighs 2240 pounds, while
when the miner is being paid for his la
bor he is required to produce and load
from 2740 to 2790 pounds for a ton, against
which "flagrant injustice the anthracite
mine workers so vigorously and' justly
protest." '.
The companies assert that the excess
weight Is required to compensate them
for impurities and refuse matter that is
loaded with the coal and cannot be mar
keted. Regarding this Mitchell says:
The statement then quotes President
Truesdale of the Delaware, Lackawanna
and Western, who in his annual report
to the directors of his company said that
the year 1901 would pass* into history as
one of the most satisfactory to the an
thracite coal companies ever known, and
the Commercial and Financial Chronicle's
comment on the report of President Oli
phant of the Delaware and Hudson, as
follows:
The average of eighteen selling prices for
1001 must' have been 30 to 40 cents higher than
In 1900 and the profits of the coal mining opera
tions of the Delaware and Hudson in 1901 .was
11,407,307.- :
The statement ridicules as absurd the
offer of President Baer, the recognized
spokesman of the coal trust, to submit
the books of the coal departments to
prove that wages could not be increased,
and says:
Eighty-five or 90 per cent of all. coal pro
duced in the anthracite regions Is from mines
owned and operated by the various coal-carry
ing railroads; the freight charges for deliver
ing a ton of anthracite coal one mile are three
times as great as those of other roads for the
hauling of bituminous coal one mile, and' as
a consequence the coal departments, while
actually earning enormous profits on a legiti
mate business, may and do appear to be losing
money, for the reason that the railway depart
ments absorb the profits of the coal . departments
by charging the coal departments exorbitant
freight rates. Thus they rob Peter to pay Paul.
It cannot be said In extenuation that there la
any peculiar necessity for this triple charge on
hard coal, for all other kinds of freightâvery
much more troublesome to handle and more
perlshable-^-are carried at a far lower rate. -

that the larger companies â whose cost of pro
duction Is necessarily lessâ could make a suf

Conscious of the great responsibility resting
upon us; apprehensive of the danger threaten
ing our commercial supremacy should the coal
miners of the entire United States become par
ticipants In this struggle, we repeat our prop

and If our premises are wrong. It our posi

sustained by facts and figures, we will again
return to the mines, take up our tools of in

a more righteous cause to claim the approval
of the American people.

President of the United Mine Worker* of
America. i
It is now apparent that the real purpose of
the coal operators is to destroy organization
among workmen. If by any chance* they should
succeed in their design â which Is not at all
likely â another labor organization will spring
from the ruins of the United Mine Workers of
America and the contest for living wages, for
humane conditions of employment, for hotter
education, for higher citizenship, will go on
until the men who produce coal â the originat
ing motor power which drives the wheels of
commerce and industry, the product that Is so
essential to the welfare of society, the mineral
which Is the very foundation of our national
prosperity â shall receive for their labor Â«uf
ficlent compensation to relieve them of the
necessity of sending their boys and girls, of
tender years and frail physique, to the mines
and mills, there to destroy their youthful vigor
In an effort to assist their under-paid patents

WARNING TO OPERATORS.
The statement says that according to
reports of various chiefs of police mere

Concluding, the statement says:

and injured annually In the anthraolta coal
mines of Pennsylvania aa were- killed and
wounded from the American ranks In tha Span

The statement tells of the fatalities
among miners, and says: . .
This recital of facts disposes of the operators'
claim that they cannot afford to pay living
wages for faithful service and unceasing toil
amid surroundings constantly fraught with tha
gravest danger.

system of measuring the earnings of their em
ployes, as they thus receive a large amount of
marketable coal for which they return no com

asked that the coal they produce shall be
honestly weighed and correctly recorded.
The visitors will, utilize this forenoon
as best pleases them, there being no set
programme. A number will ride out to
Golden Gate Park and visit the museum,
observatory and other places of Interest
in the park. Returning before 11 o'clock,
they will then visit the Mint, where the
process of turning virgin gold into the
coin of Uncle Sam's realm will be ex
plained to them. For the afternoon an
excursion on the bay has been provided.
The Call has tendered the use of a ves
sel for the editors and the party will be
accompanied by a committee from the
Press Club. The vessel will leave at 1:30
o'clock. The Union Iron Works, the
Islands in the bay and other points of In
terest will be inspected. In the evening
there will be a tour of Chinatown under
the chaperonage of four detectives es
pecially detailed for the service by Cap
tain Martin. The Utahans will leave for
Monterey to-morrow.
The association members visited Boise
City, Portland, Seattle and Victoria, B. C.
in all of which cities they were royally
entertained by local members of the press.
They were met on their arrival at the
ferry by a committee from the Press Club
and escorted to the Golden West Hotel,
where headquarters were opened. Dur
ing the afternoon the" visiting journalists
were treated to a car ride to the Cliff

SCORE SUCCESS IN IX5ND0N
To-day's exercises began with a march
of the turners, headed by the Fifth Regi
ment Band, for Schuetzen Park, where
the athletic contests were held. There
were seyeral hundred men in line, headed
by the local Turn Verein. At the park
the athletic contests were held under the
direction of Paul Uth, the head turnwart
of the 'Bezirk.
The contests to-day were on hor
izontal and parallel bars and side and
straight horses. San Francisco Turn Ve
rein was represented by sixteen men, Ein
tracht of San Francisco by twenty, Vor
waerts of San Francisco, two: Oakland
Turn Verein, seven, and Sacramento Turn
Verein, four. The men gave fine exhibi
tions of their ability as athletes and a
large crowd of spectators was in constant
attendance. Each man's skill is. figured
on a percentage and their standing will
not be known until to-morrow's contests
are completed. All those making over 50
per cent out of a possible 75 will receive
a diploma. There are three grades. In
the third or highest nine are entered; in
the second, sixteen, and in the first, twen
ty-four. High and broad Jumping, pole
vaulting, bar and ring turning, bowling
and shooting will be taken up to-morrow,
and there will be fencing and wrestling.
In the evening there will be a grand ball,
when the distribution of prizes will take
place. . '
This turnfest of the Bezirk is proving
one of the most interesting held, as is
evidenced by the attendance. There are
delegations present from the Turn Verein,
Eintracht and Vorwaerts of San Fran
cisco, Oakland, Sacramento, Stockton,
Lbs Angeles, San Diego, Marysville, Santa

dance the athletes of the Pacific
Coast Turn Bezirk closed the first
day of their nineteenth biennial
turnfest. All day long they vied
with one another on parallel and horizon
tal bars and the straight and side horse,
and thte evening the singing sections en
tertained the sturdy members of the ve
reins.
The large crowds that came last night
were added to this morning by the excur
sions from San Francisco. Two thousand
people came from the bay cities on two
excursion trains. This enlivened, the city
and the turners are practically in posses
sion of the place. A delegation of 200
turners from Los Angeles and San Diego
came in on an early train this morning
and these also gave an added interest to
the turnfest.
DRAWS A CONCLUSION.
If the G..B. Markle Company could make
a profit of over $1,000,000 in five years when the
selling price of their coal at the mines was
In substantiation of our claim that the coal
companies can afford to pay increased wageu
to the mine workers without Increasing the cost
of coal to the consumers we submit the follow
ing extracts from the Government reports
showing the selling value of the coal loaded on
cars at the mines for the eleven years begin
ning with 1800 and ending with 1900, as com
pared with 1001. The average home value of
all coal mined and sold during this period was
$1 48 per ton, while a press bulletin recently
Issued by Charles D. Walcott. director of the
United States geological survey, says that for
the year 1901. the "Jncrease In the value of the
anthracite product received at the mines
showed a gain of 27.746,164, or more than 31
per cent over that of 1000. The average price
for the marketed anthracite coal, that Is tha
product shipped to market or sold, to local
trade was $1 87, the highest figure obtained
since 1888."
In other words, while, according to President
Oliphant, 13 cents per ton represents the ope
rators' increased cost of production in 1901,
39 cents per ton â as compared with 1900 â rep
resents the increased value of the product to
the operators. In view of the fact that this
enormous Increase in the selling price of coal
has been extorted from the consumer by the
coal trust, can any one say that the demands
of the miners for a small portion of the in
creased wealth their labor has produced are
unreasonable or unwarranted?
The statement says that further evidence of
the ability of the coal mine operators to pay
increased wages Is shown In the statement of
John Markle, managing partner of the G. B.
Markle Coal Company, an independent firm
operating three mines In the Lehlgh region,
made in a suit before the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania. Mr. Markle Is quoted as say
ing that the company In the . five years from
1890 to 1894 made profits of ovet- $1,000,000. and
the statement says the Government - reports
show that the home value of coal produced
by the anthracite companies during that time
was $1 51 a ton. .
The railroad presidents contend that they
cannot Increase wages without making a cor
responding Increase in the selling price of their
product to the consumer, and have accused the
mine workers of suggesting a proposition that
would impose a hardship upon the public â¢ by
increasing the market price of coal 10 cents
a ton. the amount that would have been re
quired to meet all the demands made by the
miners; however, their solicitude for the pub
lic weal has not deterred them from advancing
the market price of their coal more than $1
per ton since the strike was inaugurated, with
out giving any part of the Increase to the mine
workers.
PKICE OF COAIi 'ADVANCED.
From 1800 to 1900, Inclusive, the mines were
In active operation an average of 182 days
per year, and for each person employed there
were produced 363.58 tons of coal per year, or
for each day the mines were In operation 2.16
tons were produced per employe; while In the
year 1901, against which the operators so bit
terly complain, the mines were In operation
194^4 days, and there were produced 475.43 tons
for each person employed, or for each day
the mines were in operation 2.36 tons were
produced per employe, thus showings conclu
sively that Instead of a deterioration there was
a decided improvement In the productive ca
pacity of the men after they became thoroughly
organized. ! Can the unprejudiced reflect upon
these facts and conlude that the anthracite
miner Is a better workman than he was before
the 10 per cent concession In wages two yeara
ago?
The presidents of the various coal-carrying
railroads have given publicity to a statement
that during the year 1901 the productive capac
ity of mine workers deteriorated an average
of 121a per cent; in other words, the United
Mine Workers' organization is accused of en
couraging poor workmanship. An examination
of the reports on coal production compiled by
the United States Government discloses the
fact that the allegations of the railroad presi
dents are misleading and untrue, as the fol
lowing figures will demonstrate:
Such pay may supply a living on a par with
some classes of European laborers; but who
will say that it is sufficient to support Amer
ican citizens or enable parents to educate and
properly maintain their families? True it is
that a 10 per cent Increase was granted by
the coal operators as a strike concession two
years ago, but It Is also true that a large por
tion of this 10 per cent was paid back to the
companies to buy the suppression of an old
powder grievance. Moreover, according to re
liable commercial agencies, the cost of living
has Increased, particularly In the purchase of
foodstuRs, from- 80, t*> =40. per, cent.- so that the
purchasing power of a miner's earnings is less
now than before the strike of 1900.
For more than twenty-five years the anthra
cite coal mine worksers of Pennsylvania have
chaffed and groaned under the most Intolerable
and inhuman conditions of employment
Imaginable. Â¦ Their average annual earnings
have been less than those of any other class
of workmen in the United States, notwith
standing the fact that their work is more haz
ardous and the cost of living greater than in
any other Important American industry. The
total number of persons employed in and
around the anthracite coal mines Is 147,600.
They are employed never to exceed 200 days In
any one year and they receive as compensation
for their services an average of $1 42 for a
ten-hour work da^- It will thus be noted that
they earn annually less than $300.
WAGE OF THE MINEBS.
To the Public: If the contest now in 'pro
gress In the anthracite coal legions of Penn
sylvania aliectfcd only the welfare of the rail
road and mining corporations on the one hani
and the coal mine workers on the oiher, the
public would have no vital interests at stake
and would consequently be less concerned than
it now is in the continuance, the extension or
the termination of the conflict; but inasmuch
as there is a third and important interest in
volved which, although in nowise responsible
for /the present strike, is, nevertheless, an in
nocent victim thereof, it is but fair and proper
that the general public should be fully and ac
curately informed upon the merits of the que3
tion In controversy. If it shall be asked why
we have waited until the- close of the tixtn
week of the strike to Issue a statement of
this nature, sufficient -answer may be found
in the fact that we have hesitated to utter any
word or take any position that" would impede
or embarrass easy reconciliation "with the coil
operators. Every delay and precaution, every
conceivable conciliatory effort that honorable
and conservative men could take to avert a
rupture and every means that thought could
suggest to bring the matter In dispute to ar
bitration was resorted to by the union both
before the strike order was issued and since
It went into effect, but without avail, the coal
magnates replying to all our overtures with thj
declaration that there was. nothing to arbitrate.
This statempnt on their part Is equivalent to
saying that the coal mine workers have made
unreasonable demands and have struck without
real or sufficient cause. To this let plain, un
varnished facts and figures reply.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., June 22.â John
Mitchell, president of the United Mine
Workers of America, to-day issued the
following address. It is partly a repiy to
the letters of the operators declining to
accede to the demands of the union,
which were published about ten days ago:
If Senators Morgan, Hanna and Kltt
redge oppose this in conference, it Is al
together probable that Representative
Hepburn and the House conferees will
withdraw It. *
â¢ Not only is President Roosevelt in
trusted with tremendous power and re
sponsibility In the matter of the selec
tion of the route, but also in the appoint
ment of the commission to carry out the
great enterprise. Seven members are
provided for, and their salaries and ex
penses will aggregate not less than $130.
w)0 annually. To conduct such a great
work without the suspicion of a scandal,
in the stress of party politics, will bÂ«
a gigantic undertaking and It is a high
compliment which Congress pays to the
character of President Roosevelt in plac
ing in his hands, without limitation or
reservation, the selection of the most
important commission* created by Con
gress since its foundation.
That should the President be unable, within
six months after the approval of this act. to
obtain for the United States, on reasonable
terms, satisfactory title to the property ot the
New Panama Canal Company and such con
trol of and jurisdiction over the necessary ter
ritory of the Republic of Colombia mentioned
in sections 1 and 2 of this act. Including; the
right to perpetually maintain and operate the
Panama Railroad.
Senator Mallory offered three amend
ments making a time limit of six, twelve
and eighteen months. AH of these wera
defeated by about the same majority by
which the Spooner substitute was after
ward adopted by the Senate.
When the House conferees finally yield
to the Senate bill an effort will be made
to Insert the Mallory amendment limit
ing the time to one year. This reads as
follows:
The House conferees, however, will not
prolong the struggle in conference in or
der to get this amendment accepted, be
lieving that the President will take up
the matter promptly and reach an early
decision.
It was said to-day that the House might
lrsist on inserting one of the amendments
offered by Senator Mallory of Florida,
putting a timÂ« limit on the President in
the matter of his investigation of the al
leged difficulties, legal and diplomatic,
which surround the Panama offer, and
are Involved in accepting the Panama
iGute.

WASHINGTON, June 22.â Hon Leo P.
Pepperman. member of the Philippine
Clvii Service Commission, is in the city,
having- just arrived on leave of absence
from Manila. Pepperman said to-day:
"The scope of the commission has been
extended gradually until it now covers 6000
positions, ranging in salary from $15 per
month to $Â«<00 per year."
He says that the immediate reward to
euccessful applicants has caused a change
in the old classical system of education
under the Spanish regime to one of more
modern civilization, based largely on prac
tical lines. So great is the interest of the
Filipinos In acquiring a knowledge of
English that 10,000 adults are going to
night schools in Manila. Before the
American occupation the American type
writers were almost unknown in the
Philippines, but now at every examina
tion held applications are being received
In typewriting and stenographing. Of the
6000 positions mentioned, 4000 are held by
the natives, the remainder by Americans.
The policy of the commission, Pepper
man says, has been to replace the Amer
icans by Filipinos as rapidly as possible.
"Under Spanish rule," he continued,
"women were unheard of in the Govern
ment service, but just before I left Manila
, three Filipino young ladles had passed
successful examinations and had been
given good positions. The Filipino makes
a splendid clerk.
"Shortly before coming to America 1
made a tour of the principal provinces for
the purpose of conducting examinations.
It was surprising how much good ma
terial was discovered, considering the
fact that the education of the island is
centered in Manila."
The former insurgent general Callles,
who surrendered to the American authori
ties in June of 1901, has notified the
board which is investigating the charges
of cruelty brought by Major Gardener
Â£gair.st American officers and soldiers in
Tayabas, Luzon, that he is willing to
testify as to the conditions which ex
isted in Tayabas Province " prior to his
surrender and after Major Gardener had
declared the province to be pacified. Gen
eral Cailles said that he agrees with Gen
eral Malvar, another former Insurgent
leader, that Tayabas Province was the
best disciplined stronghold the insurgents
had.
Captain Frederick S. Wilde of the Thir
teenth Infantry has b6en sentenced by
court-martial to be reprimanded for the
burning of a native cockpit at Lingayan,
province of Pangasinan, Luzon.
In approving the findings of the court
martial which sentenced Captain Wilde,
General Chaffee says the captain violated
a. general order and did not show proper
respect to the civil authorities.
Senor Villejas, formerly Presidente of
Santa Tomas, has been sentenced to
twenty years' Imprisonment for violating,
in several instances, his oath of allegiance
to the United States.
MANILA, June 22.â Ninety American
eoldlers have died of cholera since the
disease first broke out. Owing to the In
crease ot cholera the health authorities
here and in the provinces are enforcing
stringent regulations. The total number

ington correspondent of "Hie Call in a recent dispatch
says: '"There js a" strong sentiment in both' branches
of Congress in favor of the" annexation of the island.
Senator Plattof New York said to-day that he was
positive that a bill to annex Cuba would pass both
houses. He admitted that the initiative would have
to come. from the. Cubans and believes that sentiment
in favor. of annexation would spread rapidly in Cuba."
It is not in' Congress- only that the' annexation
sentiment exists, nor is the propaganda in favor, of
the movement confined 'to politicians. In the- cur
rent number of The; Forum, Albert G. Robinson, in
I an\ article on "Our. Legacy to the Cuban
says: "Sooner or later, and probably at no distant
day, Cuba is destined to become a part of the United
States. The annexation of the island after she shall
have made, an essay of. such independence as is";left
her. under the terms of the Platt amendment, will

Only a short time has passed since our. jubilation
over the withdrawal of the army from Cuba and "al
ready a new Cuban issue has arisen. " A resolution has
been subinittedVto the Senate providing for the an
nexation of. Cuba, and the resolution is not a freak,
nor -did it emanate-from an irresponsible statesman:
Senator lElkins, author of the resolution; is a practical
man. and a Senator of influence. Where he leads it
is certain that others will follow.
W.HEN the American flag was replaced at
Havana by the flag of free Cuba, when the
â¢ American army sailed away and President
Palma began the administration of an independent
government, the great rrlass of the American people
hailed the occasion with satisfaction as" the ending
of our relations with the Cuban, problem. It was
felt that while we might have trouble for years to
come in the Philippines, we were safely out of Cuba.
We had "prompted the establishment of an independ
ent republic,' had performed a great and generous
deed, .and now were to leave the liberated people to
make themselves strong by r grappling with their own
difficulties and working out .their, own salvation. -

stations the officers are provided * with
quarters or an allowance made for the
same where there are not enough houses,
but an unjust discrimination is mad*
when officers are serving on inspection
duty. In the latter event only officers
of the line are allowed compensation for
quarters, while naval constructors and
assistant naval constructors, who are not'
of the line, although they rank as such,
have to pay for their quarters. There 13
apparently no good reason why the In
spector of machinery or equipment should
receive an allowance of J4S0 to:}600 for

must pay for such out of his salary.
Germany's Fine Cab Service!
The whole cab service of Germany fcs
regulated in a way to make the people,
on this side of the Atlantic envious of
German institutions. In most cities a
large proportion of the cabs are provided
with "taxameters," little dials placed in
fh 0 .^** 0^" 1 * 6 s , eat - and!O arranged that
they indicate Just how much the passen-
Ker owes at any given time. For instance,
when you take a cab In Berlin the indica
tor shows a, charge of 50 pfennigs (12
c?nts) as soon as you take your seat, and
as .you drive the llsures change, 10 pfen
nigs at a time, and when you are ready io
stop you pay the sum indicated, by the
dial, no more, no less. Thus there is no
chance for extortion on the part of the
cabman and no . disagreement as to
charges, a feature of disagreeable prom
inence in London and Paris. And it mav
be said in passing that the charges ara
generally very low compared with thoso

1900. The-se figures shov^a steady gain in the export
trade of the port, and give us no cause for complaint.
Our shipping trade overland to the Territories and
Eastern States has also increased, and probably much '
more than our foreign sea trade, as the West and
Southwest are calling upon us for. supplies of farm
produce more and more every year. We now' are
a?k<?d for quotations on lines of grain,' vegetables and
fruit before the crops are harvested, and the business
of catering to the vast section between us and the
Mississippi Valley is assuming important proportions.
This is a business that does not pass through '.any
custom house and therefore is riot visible to anybody
except those in the trade itself, and up' to the present
has received little public attention. But it is incrcas- ;
ing so rapidly that it is now well to tHe front and [will
very soon be recognized as .Â£ branch of trade to be

years ago it was just the other way, but now. the
solvent borrower finds no difficulty /in getting prompt
accommodation at moderate rates of interest. - This
condition leads to the formation of new enterprises,
which continue to spring up on all sides, thus devel
oping the industries of the State to an extent never
before witnessed in our history- For all of which

While the- bank clearings of ' the country yshow a
loss, the railway earnings, on the contrary, continue
to lead those of last year, showing an active distrib

while somewhat better than they have been, are, not

New York continues to lag, probably owing- to the
marked dullness in Wall street, which has been.a
sort of Sleepy Hollow for some time. Again, the
season is backward, which affects" New York by de

crops, and also deferring the influx of money from

years. If the usual summer business is delayed until
autumn the movement then will doubtless be just
so much the heavier. It is largely a quesr>on ; of crops
in the long run, and the crop outlook is excellent.
It is only a question of weeks when activity will be

iTE strike of the operatives in the silk mills of
Patefson seems to have ; been led, if not plan
Â¦ ned, .by the anarchists who have headquarters
in that city. The assassin of the King of Italy be
longed to the Paterson band; and set forth on his
journey thence, to commit the' crime that had been
plotted in advance. After he died in the galleys his
wife became a heroine in the Eastern circles of an
Â¦ Silk weaving is an Italian industry and many op
eratives of that nationality have immigrated to the
silk centers of this country in quest of the much
higher wages and better, opportunities they may en
joy in the: United States. Many native Americans j
have become skilled in that industry, and these, with f
many peaceful Italians, were not in .'sympathy with
the strike in the mills and desired to remain at work.
The "organization of weavers, however, was controlled
by the element that was subject to the leadership of
the anarchists, and made violent resistance to re
opening the mills with the labor that was willing to
operate them. An inefficient, cowardly or sympathetic
chief of police supplied the opportunity for extreme
measures, which â¢ was at once taken advantage of,
and a bloody riot resulted, in which many lives were
in peril and property was destroyed.
Perhaps the anarchist leaders dreamed of inaugu
rating a revolution, in which the lawful authorities
would be driven off and ! the property attacked left at
their mercy. In this they were mistaken. This country
is not yet ready to leave life and property unprotected
by law. But a serious question is presented by
the incidents of labor contention this year. When
ever violence is resorted. to in a strike, and is able to
; force a surrender, the supremacy of such violence
over the law is taught and in the next labor dispute
the violence increases.
With* a Southern _ European immigration pouring
upon us by hundreds ofLthousands every year, this
is "a 'dangerous lesson to be taught. to such vast nura-.
bers who 'come, ignorant "of bur laws and with little
or no sympathy with our system of government. We
have recently published from United States Consular
reports the wages paid in the silk mills of Southern
Europe. In : Lyons, where that industry is the most
prosperous and the wages paid are highest, the av
erage wage is 60 cents a day. The report does not
state the hours which constitute a day's work, but it
is safe to say that they much exceed the hours in
American mills. As for the cost of living the same
reports show that it. exceeds the cost here.
1 Under these circumstances it would seem clear that
these immigrant strikers are bettered in amount of
wages, hours of labor and cost of living to an extent
that should content them with the change, at least
to the extent of making them obedient- to the laws
of the country, the only obedience exacted and loyal
ty" asked of our native people or of aliens who come
here. That they are not contented may be due to the
anarchist" ferment for which tHe Paterson' colony has
become noted.
The peculiar features of the riotous outbreak there
are admonitory. The idea that was uppermost in the'
encouragement of foreign immigration was that it
should assimilate and become American. In the
case of English-speaking aliens' this assimilation
readily took place in the first generation. But when
non-English speaking people huddle together in
dense colonies, as in manufacturing centers like Pat
erson, even the second generation remains non-as
similated and subject to the same misguiding influ
ences "that affected the immigrants.
It has been argued in Congress 'during discussion
'of the .Shattuc immigration , law that for economic
reasons there should be some effort made to secure
a sort of preferred immigration. This argument is
valid, but there are other reasons, political in their
nature, that go to the structure of government, which
' may well be urged. The frequently recurring ex
hibition of violence against person and property Jin .
defiance of â¢ our laws designed to protect both, and
the omission of any adequate punishment for these
outbreaks of lawless passion, tend to breed wide
spread contempt for law. Associated with universal
suffrage this growing evil, unless checked, may run
to destructive extremes which wiHsfirofoundly affect
and unfavorably change the character of the Govern
ment.
. The spectacle of; a vast and destructive riot: in an
American city, led by alien anarchists and encouraged
by an anarchist newspaper printed in a foreign
tongue, is. not agreeable to the American sense of
law and order.. Legislators should look below the
surface of these things and. not content themselves,
with such slight scratching of the skin, of the ques
tion as has heretofore passed . for statesmanship in
dealing with the subject. > ;lV:7-3*;

LEVIATHAN, BRITAIN'S BIG CRUISER,
If SHOWS SPEED IN THE TRIAL- TRIPS
THE Los Angeles newspapers recently published a dispatch
from San Francisco wherein it was reported that John
D. Spreckels had sailed for Honolulu and TV. S. Leake
had gone elsewhere. The leaders of the Gage push re
'Â¦ ceived the news with great glee, as.it seemed to give
them assurance that San Quentin affairs would not be thor
oughly ventilated before the Republican State Convention as
sembled. 'Â¦Â¦' Later on, when the -truth was revealed that the pro
prietor and manager of The Call were in San Francisco,
awaiting' the convenience of the Los Angeles Sheriff, the push
gave ; 3f gns of . sore distress. The distress was not alleviated
when subsequent messages were received announcing that the
defendants^ were in court demanding an immediate examina
tion, while the Governor's lawyer was interposing objection.
On the receipt of the first dispatch there was clamor for pa
pers to extradite Mr. Sprcckels. When it was learned that a
hearing in Judge Fritz's court was in progress the push' began
to cast about for moans to extricate Mr. Gage.
I Extradition papers may be called for later on, when the
proper authorities take hold of the Kern County bond trans
action, in which the State school fund suffered the loss of
$16,000. The' defenders of the business administration are do^
ing everything possible to hush inquiry concerning the Kern
County bond deal. It is the opinion of bankers and others
familiar with financial- transactions that an Ins ide gang ot
the push planned and executed the deal. An explanat Ion from
the Governor is In order. He la at the head of the State Board
of Examiners. Let him tell the public why he a! lowed

the Governor seem to be needed. The people would also^Hke

The sentiment of the State Is well expressed In the following
comment of the press:
REDLANDS CITRQGRAPH :
i About the strongest a/raignment of Govern
or.' Gage's conduct of the gubernatorial office
that we have seen is that published by the
Fresno Republican, which paper is edited by
Chester H. - Rowell, a relative of Dr. Chester
Rowell. It is clean but cutting, dignified but
damaging, polished but puncturing to Mr.
Gege's vanity." While this arraignment is se
vere, it is true, and no dodging can evade the
logical conclusion â no euch man ought to re
ceive the nomination, and if nominated, no such
man can be elected. The Republican's edito
rial follows :
i "He has used the power of his office to gain
practically dictatorial control of the Legisla
ture of the State, and has then used that con
trol to force through Eome of the most vicious
legislation proposed, while opposing or vetoing
some of the most important and salutary
measures. He secured the passage of a bill
fixing the terms of the appointive officers so {hat
they expire after the adjournment of the Leg
islature, thus ' practically nullifying the con
stitutional authority of the Senate to confirm
nominations. He sought to have passed, and
placed it among the emergency measures for
which he called the Legislature In extra ses
sion, ajbill giving him authority to remove all
the appointive officers throughout the State
and fill the places with his henchmen. He
could have prevented the passage of the noto
rious Assembly Constitutional Amendment No.
28, and promised to do so, but broke his prom
ise. This amendment. If ratified, will give him
the power to appoint a commission to serve
through the term of ' i*^. successor, and part of
it for ten years. wnÂ»r^i will take the place of
all the commissions and boards in the State
having to do wlth^corporatlons. A more dan
gerous proposition was never placed before a
free people. He made the fight of his Hfe
to prevent the election of an eminent and hon
orable citizen of his own section to the United
States Senate, and to elect, instead, the most
notorious leader of corrupt politics in Califor
nia. He vetoed many necessary appropriation
bills, some because the legislators Interested in
them refused to submit to. his dictation, many
in order to make a false showing of economy,
and* some from real lack of comprehension of
the actual needs of the State. He signed some
of the most pernicious" and absurd legislation,
including a law (still on the statute books) to
confiscate every newspaper property " In the
State and donate it to whoever might ask for
it. He has neglected both the dignity and
the duties of his office. He has been a politi
cian, not a Governor, and has chosen the worst
possible associates and methods, even as a poli
tician." : 'Â¦'Â¦'
SAN DIEGO UNION:
Governor Gage has been repudiated by his
party. The political history of the State dis
closes no parallel instance of a man who was
elected by a large majority to a high office
becoming so thoroughly disliked and distrusted
as is Henry T. Gage by the Republicans of
California to-day. The Governor. has been cen
sured again and again by papers of 'his party,
but perhaps the most complete and exact state
ment of the causes that have led to the repu
diation of the man and his methods is that
given by the Fresno Republican.
LOS ANGELES TIMES. 'Â¦ . -^
The fact is becoming steadily more apparent
that Henry T. Gage, if 'the Republican State
Convention should be so short-sighted as to re
nominate him for Governor, cannot be elected.
The strong opposition to his renominatlon.
which is rapidly growing stronget In all sec
tions of the State, would Insure his defeat at
the polls, even if his henchmen should succeed
in their purpose to force his nomination.
Every day brings a fuller recognition of the
fact that Governor Gage is a breeder of strife,
a disturber of Republican harmony, and â¢ an
utterly impracticable candidate for Governor.
His dictatorial methods, his demagogic appeals
to class prejudices, his Pharisaical claims to
the possession of great and ' unusual- virtues,
his unwarranted though impotent anger because
of legitimate and honest criticism, his unsavory
political associations â all these things com
bine to show that he is unfit for the position
of Governor. Of all possible candidates for the
of nee, Henry T. Gage is the weakest and the
least available.
The first aim of political parties should be to
be tight on public Questions. The next ob
ject should be to place in, nomination for office
its best and most available candidates. The
nomination of Gage, from any and every point
of view, is utterly inexpedient, and there is
not much doubt that the nominating conven
tion will so regard it: certainly that view will
prevail if the delegates will be guided by their
better judgment, and will look at the question
from the view-point Of political expediency and
common sense. -~ - v
It would be a grave tactical blunder for the
Republican party to handicap itself, at the
outset of the campaign, with a candidate whose
name is a synonym for discord . and defeat.
Such a candidate Js Henry T. Gage.
â¢ * â¢ .
Some surprise has been expressed at a pub
lished statement â since denied â that John ' D.
Spreckels had gone to Hawaii, where he would
be out of reach of the State courts. When you
come to think of it, however, this action would
not have been more remarkable than the fact
that Governor Gage should go down to the ob
scure hamlet of Wilmington to file a damage
suit against the San Francisco -newspaper man.
It is something like going up to the top of
Old Baldy to catch sea bass. . ._

. The boasted economical streak of the Gov
ernor- of California does not apply when, he is
the complainant in a criminal action,' as it
would seem, and as the San Francisco Call
clearly points out. The expense to the"" State

before a Justice' of the Peace in Wilmington
Township will amount to a very considerable
item. But. when there is an eruption on â t'll

ONTARIO RECORD-OBSERVER:
Governor . Gage is anxious to succeed .himself
â a natural ambition; but "the people do not
want him, and if his nomination is forced upon
the party, the party will rue it. ' We give our
readers this week some comment from various
papers in the State that are opposed to see
ins the party saddled with Gage at the com
ing fall elections.
TTJLABE REGISTER:
It is very necessary for a political party to
have an organization and it is not a good thins
to down an organization in a convention merely
because it is an organization. It ought to be
downed when it deserves to be' downed, but
not otherwise, and it deserves to be when It
gets in behind unfit men and strives to put
them into offices they ought not to fill. The
Republican party organization Is supposed to
be, erroneously perhaps, behind the candidacy
of Henry T. Gage for Governor, and y so, that
organization deserves to be downed In the
primaries and resulting convention. On the
other hand, if the organization will get in be
hind the^ candidacy of soma good Republican,
some man worthy of the high office of Governor
of California, why. well and good. The. pÂ«o
pl<* will support it and do it -willingly. It aU
depends on the man. and there are symptom*
which ;would seem to show that the party or
ganization 13 tending toward that conclusion
and that Henry T. will soon hear something
"drap." Â¦f-'^'i.''â W--
VISALIA DELTA: .
The Delta's opposition to Gage Is not based
on personal grounds. "We are opposed to him
because he is a tool In the hands of Dan
Burns. He has removed without causa iomÂ«
of the best officials the State has ever had.
He signed the infamous signature bill and.mada
California the laughing stock of the nation.
He vetoed the water and forest bill, a most
worthy measure. "We hare no use for Gag*.
L0DI HERALD:
The spirit of opposition which has sprun? uj>
like wildfire throughout the State to the can
didacy of Gage arises to a great extent from
the popular detestation of the methods by
which bosslsm is to crowd him down the
throats of the party. But tha people will not
indorse the man who fcaa found favor in the
eyes of Dan Burns. Thousands of Republican
voters refused to swallow Estee under similar
conditions. Gage's nomination would be even
more forcibly repudiated than was Estee'3.
0BOVILLE REGISTER:
: .'When the Republicans of Butte select dele
gates to the State convention this year, they
ought not and should not select delegates for
Gage. To do so. would be the greatest mistake
the Republicans of this county ever made.
The nomination of Henry T. Gage for Gov
ernor would be suicidal on the part of the
Republican party of California.
See to it that no Gage man is named as a
delegate.' Â¦'. . â¢' "' Â¦*' â¢
HOLLISTER ADVOCATE:
Quite a. number of counties have elected dele
gates, and wherever instructions have been
given, they are- enthusiastically for Flint. It is a
significant fact that up to date no mention has
been made of Gage, who seems to have dropped
out of sight in connection with the idea of re
election.
HTTMBOLDT STANDARD:
No man should be forced upon the ticket by
the bosses or the Burns machine. No man
should be selected as the Republican . standard
bearer 'Who win -not receive- the heatf tj 'Â¦ sap-,
port of aU factions of the - party. . It is bad
politics to select a candidate that. a portion of
his own party will bitterly oppose. A great
number of Republicans bitterly oppose Gov
ernor Gage. It is not ; customary to nominate
even an acceptable Governor for a second term
In this State, where the term is four years,
and It would be folly to nominate any man
who created so 'many antagonisms ad Gover
nor Gage has done within the past. four years.
With a popular candidate, one who ean unite
the. party and receive the harmonious support
of all Republican papers and organizations,
California will elect a Republican Governor by
15.000 majority. Such a man can be found.
There are Edson, Flint, Pardee. Preston and
any number of "dark horses" who could carry
the State. One of these should be selected and
the Humboldt delegation should be elected, not
by the machine which Is dominated by Dan
Burns and stands for Gage, but by the people
who believe in taking charge of their own
votes and compelling the bosses to retire.

His career is admonitory. The people of whom
he spoke followed sound money out of the party he
represented'and to-day his great issue is remembered
only as a passing convulsion. In a few years other
public issues now v being quarreled over will have
gone the same way. .
He was mistaken as to the temper of the people,
but when he uttered the sentence that is in
scribed on his monument, "I do speak for the great
masses of the Mississippi Valley when I say that we
will not submit to the domination of any party, how
ever much we may lo^e it, that lays the sacrificing
hand upon silver and will demonetize it," he was hon
est in the belief that he knew, what the people wanted.
He really survived the issue upon which his fame
depends. Free silver was dead before its great pro
ponent pjiSfed away. Many mourned him who re
joiced whtn his issue died, and his pathetic monu
ment, recording a' life that failed in its great purpose,
but succeede/i in one essential of manhood, in that
it was the fife of a plain and honest gentleman, will
be far from the least impressive of the many memori
als built by friendship and affection to perpetuate the
memory of American worthies.
Randall only lived up to liis lights as an astute pol
itician when he sent Bland into exile on an obscure
committee, but from a Democratic standpoint it
would have been better to have made him chairman
of trie Committee of Ways and Means and the leader
of the House, since he led it anyway. He could have
made - no other # use of his place at the head
bÂ£ : the coinage committee, and he was not
equipped to make that use of it by any pro
found, knowledge . of finance, yet neither
friend ~ nor : foe ever suspected that he was
aught but honest and sincere in his advocacy of the
free eoinige of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. The"
'isisue^was snatched from his hands in 1806 by Mr.
Bryan, and served, to thoroughly alarm, the country
arid defeat the' party that adopted it, but Mr. Bland
lived and died enjoying the confidence of the country
in vhis sincerity.
"It is said that, he 'spoke of this to Morrison, who
had no word of blame for Speaker Randall's way of
paying his political debts, but advised Mr. Bland to
study the career of Stephen A. Douglas after he was
demoted to the . Committee on Territories and pro
ceeded to repeal the Missouri compromise by his
Kansas-Nebraska bill and doctrine of squatter sov
ereignty. Bland took the hint, looked "into the coin T
age act 6f .1873, -discovered what the country had for
gotten, that it obsoleted the old silver dollar and
made a gold dollar the unit of value. Soon from far
down the line -where Randall had sent the honest and
energetic Missourian rose sounds of eruptive states
manship, and Mr. Bland equaled Douglas in the
space filled by the issue he created, and imitated
Douglas also in "destroying his. party with that issue
in 1896 as Douglas had destroyed it in i860.
It is probable that his selection of the silver ques
tion as a specialty in statesmanship was' more the
result of accident than of design. The death of Michael
C. Kerr, while holding the Speakership of the first
Democratic House that was elected after the Civil
War, drove the party into an unexpected contest for
the succession. The candidates were Morrison, Ran
dall and S. S. Cox, all, as far as the issue was then
developed, sound money men. Bland supported Mor
rison, but -Randall won. When the committees of the
House. were made up Bland was sent away back to
sit down at the head of one that met once, during a
session, that of coinage, weights and measures.
But there is no evidence "that he was ever, a student
of financial science. When a 'young man he lived in
Nevada several years, and at Virginia City held a
minor judicial office, fh which he acquitted himself
without reproach. While there he was in\contact
with the remarkable history of the Comstock, and
witnessed the output from that great lode of the
greatest volume and variety of the precious metals
that has ever been produced from one locality of
equal area. If he made any ventures in mining they
did not bring him wealth, and he finally returned to
his native State to give her more space in national
matters^fhan she. had enjoyed since the days of Ben
ton.
THERE is an element of pathos in the dedication
of a monument, to the late Hon. Richard P.
Bland by his neighbors in the Missouri dis
trict which he represented long and honestly in Con
gress. Bland was not a genius, but had good mental
capacity and fair training. He was; an honest man
and desired to benefit his fellows, bringing to that
work as a public man a feeling of fellowship with the
people and certain inflexible convictions as to their
interests which should be in the equipment of all pub
lic men.

Consul James Hoyle of Liverpool re
ports "large increases in the imports of
canned fruits from the United States.
The packing of green fruits has improved
notably, to the general satisfaction of the
trade in England. Since the process call
ed "chilling" beef has been adopted there
is practically no competition from other
countries in this trade.
The above remarks, Emery says, are
confirmed by the report of other consular
reports In England.
But despite all prejudices, continues the
Consul, and solely because of merit and
cheapness. American trade in every line
continues to develop. That It might dou
ble at a bound if our exporters would only
study and conform to the peculiarities
of British demand, still goes without re
peating. Â¦ In hosiery, farm and gen
eral machinery, shelf hardware, oil stoves,
coal ranges, furniture' of all classes,
shoes, dress novelties, canned fruits, veg
etables, meats, etc., the volume of trade
grows gradually and surely. Leicester,
which a few years ago exported shoes to
a considerable extent, now not only does
not export, but uses a great deal of Amer
ican finished leather, while three-fourths
of the shoe machinery in use is either
American make or from American pat
terns and American shoes are successfully
retailed throughout the district. Our soda
fountains have made their appearance
this year and in almost every store Amer
ican wares are gradually and surely find
ing place.
Most noticeable, perhaps, of all prevail
ing trade conditions in England, says
Consul S. C. McFarland of Nottingham,
is the nervous antagonism against for
eign goods which has sprung up among
the British people. There has long been
prejudice against German products, but
the recent enormous growth of American
trade In all branches has forced itself on
the attention of British newspapers, man
ufacturers and the public generally. The
Brttish people are nothing if not loyal
and they inherit the belief that a Britisn
trade mark is a guarantee of quality.
There is a disinclination to purchase
American or German wares, unless by
reason of novelty of design or economy,
the latter appeal irresistibly. The retail
er, therefore, is chary in his offerings and
many lines of goods are now sold with
out comment which one or two years ago
were advertised as of "American make"
or "American style." The Diamond
Match Company parades its goods under
the old English name of Bryant & May;
the American Tobacco trust calls itself
the English Tobacco Company and adver
tises its goods as made in England by
British workmen; the "proprietary medi
cines which were first introduced as
American discoveries now blot from their
advertisements anything that might iden
tify them as importations from the Unit
ed States. With every internal ailment,
from the apparent effects of the South
African war to the idleness of labor in
certain localities attributed to American
competition, the prevailing prejudice can
be understood.

mer ' companions and was kept under
guard until a party of returning packers
were met.' He was turned over to them
with instructions to deliver- him and his
effects at the â¢ first town and have him
placed under bonds to keep the peace.
"No, I haven't that honor," replied' the
Emperor. t
"Well, I -am the Shah of Persia," said
the peasant, and then he urged his old
horse to a trot, and the . Emperor got
such a shaking that he made no further,
attempt to converse with his imperial
brother the peasant. , !*\^ " ; . -
"And do you know who I am?"
Convinced that his companion was try
ing to play a joke on him, the peasant an
swered with superb indifference:
"Do you know who I am?" asked the
Emperor.
"Upon my faith, I haven't the least
Idea." answered the peasant. , t
"I am the Emperor of Austria," said
Francis Joseph. -
. Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria was
hunting recently, and at nightfall found
himself at a considerable distance from
the castle in which he was staying. He
was very- tired and was wondering how
he could get home, when suddenly a
peasant's wagon appeared. Halting the
driver, the Emperor asked if he might
ride, and the peasant bluntly told him to
get in. Then the following conversation
occurred: . '
Peasant's Joke on the Emperor.
"To me the. horse that won told the
whole story in the race against the diffi
culties of life. His owner is reported to
have sa.id it was only an ordinary ani
mal, trained-well and ridden well. What
a success our lives would be. if our pow
ers were as well disciplined and as well
guided." â¢'Â¦â¢â¢.
"The racetrack is in bad repute. People
have been led to believe no one can wit
ness a race without gambling. Did the
70,000 people who passed the gates leave
their moral principles outside when they
went in? . Many would say 'yes.' I say
no such sweeping assertion is creditable.
The great majority of that crowd took
no part in the betting.,- They went there
because it was a great> dress parade;
others because the race was a great at
traction for them. ,' â¢ â¢â¢ , . Â¦ â¢ Â¦
"I hope to see the day -when the harm
ful features of the race are eliminated
and the racetrack elevated to a plane
where everybody may be able to- enjoy
the sport. The race in itself is harmless.
Aside from the betting ring, he thought
the race innocent amusement and a les
son in the struggle of life. He prefaced
his remarks by saying he went to the
Derby to study a lesson. He added:
Rev. Johnson Henderson of Armour
Mission voiced these sentiments on the
big Derby race In his sermon to-night on
"Glimpses of Life as Represented at the
American Derby."
CHICAGO, June 22.â "I do not want to
commend a horse race, neither do I de
sire to denounce it. God knows there are
enough of people ready to denounce every
kind of sport. It is unsafe to prescribe
forms of amusement for some people. One
wants a game of ping-pong, another the
excitement of a race. Both may be car
ried- to such extent that they will be
come harmful. f It is a question of man
hood In any event."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, June 22. â According to
advices received to-day from Thunder
Mountain there have been some impor
tant- developments near the Dewey mine,
in the section where are located the-" Mam
moth and Rockford group of claims, and
where the most promising showing in the
district Is made. Development work has
demonstrated that the claims in that sec
tion "go down"; that is, the ledges im
prove in size and richness with depth.
As the formation is very similar over the
entire gold fields, the proving of this sec
tion is looked upon as assuring the con
tinuity'of the ledges throughout that im
mense area. The result is that many
who were backward about investing on
the former surface showing are now join
ing the rush. : Numerous strikes are re
ported all over the gold fields. Some of
the ledges have been uncovered a width
of more than 200 feet. They are on im
mense-porphyry dykes that in places jut
out of the mountain, thirty feet high.
Many of the miners now in the fields are
arranging to sluice the. decomposed sur
face, the existence of which first at
tracted attention to Thunder Mountain.
From this decomposed quartz the four
Caswell Â¦ brothers last year washed out
$12,000 in eleven days' run. The 100-stamp
mill for the Dewey mine is ready to be
shipped â¢ as soon as the wagon road ' is
completed. . Â¦
Regular mail service from this city will
be inaugurated July. 1. The postofflce will
be established at Rosevllle. - The Post
master and a corps of clerks are now on
the ground. Â¦

Mrs. Gertrude Atherton has departed
for the East after a pleasant visit here,
having taught many a lesson in self-ap
preclatlon. It has been repeatedly ob
served that whenever Mrs. Atherton Â¦was
introduced as "the greatest literary
genius of our times" she took the mat
ter quite - seriously and bowed acqui
escence. In fact, no tribute less than this
would be acceptable to the lionized writer.
When less extravagant terms were used
or, perhaps, some venturesome females
laid claim to cleverness, this "greatest
literary genius of our times" would soon
rob them of her fair presence.

The opinion of the House leaders is that
this coming week will be the last full
week of the present session of Congress.
Although no resolution for a sine die ad
journment has yet been introduced, the
leaders generally fix the date of final ad
journments of Congress at July 3.
The Philippine civil government bill
will hold the boards in the House, except
as for such times as Is occupied in dis
posing of conference reports until Thurs
day and possibly until Friday.
Members generally are using It as a ve
hicle for political speeches to be circu
lated, in the coming, campaign, and its
passage by a Republican vote is assured.
The remainder of the week will be taken
up with conference reports on appropria
tion bills and other measures in dispute
between the two houses. As soon as the
recolution providing for the final adjourn
ment is adopted motions to suspend the
rules will be in order at any time, and
this will generally facilitate business
during the closing days of the session.
Senators generally do not count on an
extra session ' immediately in . case a
treaty should be sent In, but many of
them are inclined to believe that if the
treaty is completed the. Senate will be
called together in extraordinary session
for its consideration soon after the No-'
Vf.mber elections In order to Â¦ get the
treaty out of the way if possible before
the Â¦ beginning Â¦ of the regular session In
December. Indeed It may be said that
this is the present programme Â«o far as
a programme has been outlined, though
its execution probably will depend some
what on the result of the elections and
whether they are considered favorable to
reciprocity or not. â¢â¢ .
It is possible that the Cuban committee
will report the reciprocity bill before ad r
journment, but if it should do so, there
will be no effort to secure action on it
owing to the well known opposition of a
large part of the Senate.
The friends of the policy of reciprocity
are quite determined to bring the matter
up at tho next session and report what
they said in Friday's conference that they
â¢will not desist until they accomplish their
purpose. Whether in the end they will do
this through a bill or through a treaty
they do not now undertake to say. It is
generally understood about the Senate
that a reciprocity treaty with Cuba is well
under way, but it is not believed that
there will be any effort to ratify it dur
ing the present session, even if the doc
ument should be sent to the Senate. The
disposition in brief is to go to the coun
try on the question in the hope that
the cause will be strengthened thereby
and that at least some of the beet sugar
Republicans will be won over by next
December.
AWAIT NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.
Senators generally predjet that Con
gress will disperse between the first and
the Fourth of July. The session proba
bly will be extended somewhat by the
necessity of concluding - consideration' of
the "Philippine government bill, as all the
appropriation bills could be finally dis
posed . of during the present week. The
House, however, Â¦will not pass on the
Philippine bill until the latter part of the
week and it is expected that it will be
necessary to devote considerable time in
conference to the differences between the
Senate and House. No Senator now
places the day of adjournment beyond
July 4. The conference between the two
houses on the inter-oceanic canal bill has
been arranged and it is expected that an
agreement will, be reached during the
present week.
The rest of the week will be given over
to conference reports on appropriation
bills and other measures in dispute be
tween the two Houses. The conference
report on the naval appropriation bill will
be submitted on Monday, and early con
sideration will be given the report. There
also will be an effort to have the dispute
over the army bill adjusted during the
week, with some prospect of success. . The
Committee on Appropriations will take up
the general deficiency bill to-morrow and
probably will report it the latter part of
the week. This is the last of the appro
priation bills, and with its disposal there
will be little in the way of final adjourn
ment of Congress. â¢ j
CONFERENCE ON CANAL BILL.
Senator Penrose on Monday will report
the general immigration bill, and it is un
derstood that he will make strenuous ef
forts to have the measure considered dur
ing the weekt or at least before the final
adjournment of Congress.
On Tuesday the Senate will take up in
obedience to the wish of Senator Burton
the bill creating a national forest reserve
in the southern Appalachian Mountain
range, but the understanding is that con
sideration of the measure shall be con
fined to- one day's debase. Wednesday
Senator McCumber. will be heard in sup
port of the pure food bill, but considera
tion of this question under agreement will
be confined to a speech by the Senator,
and there will be no effort at that time
to pass the bill. Senator Stewart's bill
confirming the agreement with the Choc
taw and Chickasaw Indians is the. un
finished business, and it is understood to
be Stewart's purpose to press its consider
ation when there is no more highly privi
leged matter to be considered.
' Some interest is manifested in the notice
of Senator Quay that to-morrow he- will
call up his motion for the discharge of the
Committee on. Territories from further
consideration of the omnibus statehood
bill in order' to secure action on It during
the present session, but the understanding
now is that he will not press his motion,
and the question will go over until the
next session of Congress in obedience to
the wish of the Republican leaders.' Sen
ator Bate, however, has stated that if
Senator Quay does not press his motion,
ha (Bate) will move to have the commit
tee discharged and the bill taken up. This
motion would bring the question up, but
coming from the minority side of the
chamber, it would be predestined to de
feat, as it is understood there are very
few, if any, Republican Senators who will
support such a motion if made by a Dem
ocratic Senator.
NATIONAL FOREST RESERVE.
Â¦, WASHINGTON, June 22.â The session
of the Senate during the present week
will be devoted to odds and ends of legis
lation. It was the purpose of the Repub
lican steering committee to make the Cu
ban reciprocity bill the order of business
after the disposition of the inter-oceanic
canal bill, but the. two Republican â¢ con
ferences have rendered it evident that
there could be no . reciprocity legislation
this session, so the steering committee has
abandoned its purpose. â¢ .

Jim Morley, manager of the Lot Angeles
ball team, departed for the East last eight In
search cf players to aid him in bringing* the
flag to Los Angeles. Morley is an energetic
cearcher and will no doubt return with a bunch
of stars that will surprise the fans.
Before leaving town Morley appointed Fred
Raj-mer, his star second baseman, captain of
the Angels. Raymer is a fast, brainy player
and under his guidance the Angels should 6how
much improvement.' Householder did not have
a fair chance to direct the movements of his
men from the outfield. . "*â¢
Householder, the star slugger of the league,
only got one hit during the entire week. He
will have to do somÂ«. clever work with the bat
if he hopes to keep his lead over McCreedie,
who has been hitting at a .600 clip during the
past series. '
Hartwell has improved 100 per cent In his
work since last season. He used to be as wild
es the proverbial March hare, but now he has
not only developed control but also a change
of pace which worries the batsman.
Jackson Etruck his batting- gait yesterday
an<i walloped the ball for four hits in the two
games. The crowd has taken a liking to him
and always gives him the jubilant hand.

Both Shay and Reilly played great ball
around third base. Shay made two errors out
of easy chances, but took all the hard ones
gracefully.
Harris began to get nervous when Kane de
veloped a generous streak in the fifth. He
took no chances in keeping him in the box. j
Although but nine trapshooters con
tested in the regular monthly live bird
shoot of the Golden Gate Gun Club yes
terday at the Ingleside traps, a number
of high scores were made. Murdock and
Sweeney each made straight scores, while
Haight and Nauman lost but one bird. In

won gold bars, while Nauman secured a
silver medal. Silver bars were also won
by Nauman and Murdock in the pool
shoot. Roos, who shot for pleasure in'
the pool event, made fifteen straight and
was awarded a gold bar. Murdock al

The Pony ball tossers completed their
week's laborious toil in a manner that
has inspired the fans. They have shown
by their work that they are there in the
run for the cloth. Although they fell
down yesterday in both little scraps with
Morley's Angels, they emerged from, the
series with four straight wins to their
credit and a corresponding Increase in
their percentage column. The morning
score was 2 to 1 and in the afternoon the
board read 6 to 3.
The struggle commenced much in favor
of the southern standard bearers. â¢ To
man and Lawler. the first t?>- up, ac
cepted free tickets and Jackson sacrificed.
Reilly brought in the first pair of runs
with a clean single over third.
The Ponies were equal to the emergency
and followed suit. Shugart and Leahy
Â¦walked in the second and Delmas made
himself the most popular man In the
house when he walloped a line drive for
two bags which brought in the two run
ners.
From the second round on the Angels
â¢were the sure thing agents. In the fifth
Kane began to relapse into his old pas
time of walking men to first. Glendon
was substituted, but his offerings were
all kindly received. Lawler forced Hart
well at the plate on a single to left. Jack
son responded with a clean two-cushion
punch to center, which brought in two
runs. Jackson grot as far as third on
Shay's drop of Shugarfs throw to third
and he spiked the pan when Householder
flew out to center field.
After the fifth the Pony stable did not
figure in the running. They scored one
in the eighth, but that availed them
nothing. Many times did men reach the
bases, but the masterly pitching of Hart
well kept both runs and hits where Mor
ley liked to see them and the game was
practically ended as far as the result
counted.
Kane began the pitching for the Ponies,
but was wilder than usual and after pass
ing five men in four rounds Harris re
belled and ordered the lanky south shoot
er to the woodshed. Glendon was sub
stituted and was an improvement in con
trol only, for the Angels succeeded In
getting to him when the time was ripe
for a tally.
Hartv.ell showed up in superb form, ex
cept in the second, when he walked two
men and then allowed a two-bagger
which netted two runs. Jackson did I>a
joie stunts with the stick. Both Shugart
and Raymer starred around the second
pillow. The score:

Handball players will * be pleased to
learn that Philip Casey, the retired cham
pion of the world, and James Dunne of
Brooklyn, N. Y. f will again visit this
coast. Both are wealthy men, and hav
ing warm personal .friends here, enjoy a
vacation trip to this coast. They are both
ex-Aldermen of Brooklyn and are politi
cians of influence in that city. They will
leave New York about July 12 and will
stop over at Denver for a few days. They
will remain here a month or more. A
number of exhibition games will be ar
ranged, and lovers of the old Irish game
will thus be afforded an opportunity of
again seeing the masters In action. The
local players are much better prepared
to meet them than heretofore. Fitzgerald,
the present world's champion, has been
here some time. Since the last visit of
the Eastern experts the standard of the
game has been raised. â¢ .
Mr. Casey Is_one of the greatest ex
ponents of the game ever seen In this or
any other country. He is the retired un
defeated champion of the world, and at
the present time, although well along in
years, plays a marvelous game. When at
Iris best he played with all comers, and
Â¦ never once were his colors lowered. Mr.
Dunne is a good player.; With Casey for
a partner they have never been .beaten.
They have repeatedly crossed the Atlan
tic and participated in championship
games and were successful in every con
test. Mr. Dunne never became as pro
ficient at the game as was Casey, but
coupled as a team they were almost in
vincible.

So vicious were the liquor laden passen- /
gers that before Pecoto, the first station
west of Niles, was reached the railroad
officers were overpowered, Butler having
been hit over the head with a bottle. At
Decoto a telephone message was sent to
Oakland police headquarters for asslst
atce. In response Detective Kyte, Po
licemen Stahl and Scanlan met the picnic
train at Broadway and First street. But
ler pointed out the fighters. There waa
a renewal of the battle when the Oakland
contingent of bluecoats essayed to make
some arrests.
John O'Brien, a shoemaker of San
Francisco, who had tried to lay Butler
low with the bottle, objected to going
with Detective Kyte. It required the usÂ«
of a strongly planted left hook on
O'Brien's jaw to convince him that ae
was going. He was charged with assault
with a deadly weapon.
Joseph Smith, another San Francisco
shoemaker, was gathered in for striking
Butler with his fists. A charge of bat
tery was placed against him at the City
Prison. Charles Powers, a ship fitter, and
Thomas Roe, a boiler-maker, both aiso
from San Francisco, gave their moral
support to the battle against the police
men by numerous loudly proclaimed
oaths. Disturbing the peace was tho
charge filed against them.
Butler emerged from the melee with a
black eye and scratched face." He said
the crowd started as soon as the train
left the park to fight and smash.
Too much picnic whisky at the outing
of the Independent Rifles of San Fran

calling out of a squad of Oakland police
men to assist in quelling the disturbance,
which continued at top speed from Niles

ents were arrested after more fighting

with the debris without a single fatality.
For a few minutes after the crash It was
thought several lives had been loot, but
by quick work firemen and policemen res
cued all those who had not escaped
through their own efforts.
The escape of those who were taken
from the debris was marvelous, as there
were tons of brick, mortar and woodwork
piled in above where they were found.
Three men -who were on the third floor
are thought to be the most seriously in
jured. They are:
J. Fife fell from, third floor to the

from shock; J. F. Hoffman, serious cut in
leg and suffering from shock; J. Ross,
thought to be Injured Internally. Others
injured, but not seriously, axe:

The wholly inadequate police force was
first exploited by Marshal Kerns at a re
cent meeting of the Town Board. At pres
ent one Marshal and four deputies have
to cover an area half as large as that of
Oakland. ' The f ruitlessness : of their en
deavors Is shown try the increasing num
ber of hold-ups and house-breaking cases
during the last year.
Relative to this matter Lyman Al
len, president of the Board of Trade,
said:
"There are many towns in the State of
the size of Berkeley which have a regu
larly uniformed police force. That we
have none is a matter of general concern
to the residents of this town. I feel that
that Improvement is Imperative." â¢
The recently established system of fire
alarms, while generally deemed a step In
the right direction, does not meet the de
mands of Berkeley property owners. R.
C. Staats, secretary of the Board of
Trade, is very positive In his belief that a
paid fire department is necessary!
"If we want to have lower rates of in
surance and consequently more business
here in Berkeley," said he, "we must have
a more i adequate lire department As it
is, when we have any kind of a fire we
have to bring engines out from Oakland
to handle it The trouble is that the large
property owners, who most need the serv
ices of an efficient fire department, are
just the people who do not want to see
the taxes raised for the purpose of pay-
Ing for this improvement" -
F. L. Naylor. president of the First Na
tional Bank, had this to say of the pro
posed improvements:
"It is certain that an adequate police
force and fire department are indispensa
ble to the increasing needs of Berkeley.
The trouble is that Berkeley is rapidly
becoming a city, but that its inhabitants
won't recognize it as anything- more than
a town and don't care to pay for much
needed improvements." , :?'+.'. .-

LATE CITY COUNCILMAN OF

FALLING WALLS
INJURE GUESTS
OAKLAND, June 22.â To-day was a
day of congratulation, figures and
charity among the Elks of Oak
land. The congratulation was
among the members of the order
because of the successful ending of the
street fair and carnival. The figures
were those being made by Director Gen
eral Schlueter and his corps of assistants.
The charity came when a meeting vas
held of the various committees and Di
rector General Schlueter was authorized
to announce to all charitable organiza
tions that the Elks would make no
charge for concessions conducted by them
and that the various organizations would
be allowed to retain their gross receipts.
This is an important matter to the
Young Women's Christian Association,
West Oakland Home. Fabiola Hospital,
Emeryville Free Kindergarten and New
Century Club, for it means that these
organizations will be given every cent
they collected during the carnival. These
societies agreed to pay Into the
treasury of the Elks' carnival committee
10 per cent of their receipts. This money
was to be applied upon the construction
of the booths, lights and similar expenses
which the Elks had to pay, and it was
estimated that this percentage would just
about pay what these items would cost.
The ladies were highly pleased, however,
when they learned of the action taken by
the Elks.
LIVE TTP TO PRINCIPLES.
When Director General Max Schlueter
met his assistants and commltteemen to.
day and they figured upon the splendid
success of the carnival it was the unani
mous opinion of those present that one
of the cardinal principles of the Elks or
der should be fully lived up to in this
case, and that the ladles who conducted
booths should be permitted to keep their
entire receipts and whatever expenses
were incurred by the Elks for building
and lighting should be paid from the gen
eral carnival fund. Director General
Schlueter was authorized to announce to
the ladies that no settlement of any kind
would be expected from them and laat
.their percentage would be donated by the
Elks lodge. This means that about $300
in cash is donated to five charities by the
. This action is in line with the original
standard set by the Elks for their car
nival. They decided that the gates should
remain closed on Sunday; that no liquors
should be sold on the grounds, though $100
a day was offered for a bar concession;
that no slot machines should be permitted,
though big percentages were offered for
the privilege, and as a result there was
NO DRINKENQ ALLOWED.
"We have made a success of the car
nival," said Director General Schlueter,
"and we want to be just as liberal as
possible. The Elks were organized for
charity, and it is a very great pleasure
for us to be able to- help some of the
charitable organizations of the town. The
Elks will expect nothing from the ladles
at all and they will be permitted to re
tain their gross receipts."
Elks, ranging in amounts from $25 to the
Emeryville Free Kindergarten to about
$75 to the Toung Women's Christian As
sociation.
It was announced to-night that the win
ner of the horse and buggy at the guess-
Ing contest booth was L. A. Swift of Oak
land. The number of shot and walnuts in
the jar prepared for the guessing was 15,
393. and Mr. Swift guessed 15,400.
J. C. Hanna, chairman of the ticket
committee, is preparing a tabular state
ment of the receipts showing the exact
amount of business done by each con
cession, the returns from the gate, and
from every feature of the carnival. Mr
Hanna originated a system of keeping
the accounts between the Elks and tho
concessioners that saved 'the Elks much
money. It put a complete check on the
various concessions, and to his work iÂ«
attributed not a little of the financial suc
cess of the fair.
Not a little of the success of the event
was due to the excellent musical pro
grammes that were offered. I The music
committee determined to make this a fea
ture and succeeded. This was one of the
big items of expense, $1500 being spent for
melody. Joseph Callaghan, who Is a mem
ber of Oakland Lodge, undertook the or
ganization of a complete band and suc
ceeded in a way that pleased even the
most fastidious members of the music
committee.
It is probable that the fair directly and
indirectly set in circulation and motion
$100,000 in money, which was spent inside
and outside of the' grounds for lighting,
decorations, in restaurants and among the
merchants of Oakland^ These are the fig
ures which have caused congratulation
among the Elks of Oakland.
MUSIC WAS EXCELLENT.
not a drunken person in the premises and
not a disturbance occurred.
The largest day during the week was
the closing day, when 30,328 people paid
to pass through the gates. It' is estimated
that 25,000 of these were present- in the
evening, and more than 5000 of these came
from San Francisco. The . next largest
day was "Woodman day," on Thursday,
when more than 20,000 people paid to pass
the gates. Elks' night, on Monday, had
slightly less than 20,000 paid admissions.
Â¦ The paid attendance during the week
was 132,997. The ElksTiave on hand about
$27,000 in cash and their profits will be be
tween $12,000 and $15,000.^It will be a week
or more before the exact figures are
known. These profits will be applied upon
the furnishing of the new Elks' Hall,
which is about to be erected. It is esti
mated that visitors from San Francisco
and surrounding cities left as much
money in Oakland as was taken out by
the concessions at the fair.

/ f^. AKLAND, June 22.â After an ill
/|\,\V ness of two months, which be
ll II .came serious ten days ago. City
.^L^X Councilman Â¦Â¦ Charles A. Bon." a
prominent vineyardist, died at
9:45 this morning at bis residence, 3693
Telegraph avenue. â¢
Councilman Bon's condition became
critical during the last forty-eight hours.
Although his physician, Dr. O. D. Hainlln',
did not give up hope until near the end;
he could offer little encouragement to the
patient's relatives and friends. Death was
due to a complication of troubles, started
from ah attack of jaundice. Mr. Bon
had apparently been Improving until ten
days ago, when he was stricken on the
street with a severe hemorrhage. Friend3
hastened the sufferer home In a carriage
and from that time he began to fail.
Councilman Bon was born July 29, 1864,
or nearly thirty-eight years ago, in San
Francisco. His father, the late Jean B.
Bon; was one of the earliest pioneers of
California, and for many years was a
leading importer of European wares and
products. At the age of 5 years, the boy
with his family came to Oakland, which
was his home continuously until his
death. Mr.' Bon was educated' in the
public schools of Oakland, : and was a
graduate of .the University of California.
After his . graduation he became asso
ciated with the importing firm of Carpen
tier & Co. Â¦ of San Francisco. .Utter he
had' the management of his father's es
tate. His connection with the firm of
Chauche & Bon, proprietors of the Mont
Rouge vineyards at Livermore, began
about seven years ago, after the demise
of A. ; G. Chauche, who married Bon's
sister on his deathbed. Mr.- Bon became
the active manager of the vineyards and
conducted the business with his sister as
a co-partner, v The Mont Rouge product,
both red and' white wines, is among the
leading brands in this State.
The deceased vineyardist never took an
active interest in Oakland politics until
the last municipal campaign, when he
was nominated as a Councilman-at-large
Mrs. Somers is in a very precarious con
dition and it is doubtful if she will be
able to identify any of her assailants:
In order to stifle her screams they filled
her mouth with sand, , which nearly
strangled her. The police hope to cap
ture the other members of the gang to
day. â¢ Â¦ .- . . â¢'Â¦Â¦Â¦';;Â¦ .. â¢". '.
When the outrage was reported at po
lice headquarters several * officers were
detailed on the case.
Wheii Police Officer Sullivan arrived on
tfie scene the ruffians left their victim,
who was too weak to rise from the side
walk, and fled. Sullivan gave chase and
captured a young hoodlum named Richard
Tobin. H6 was taken to the Southern
Station, but denied that he was impli
cated in the outrage.
At the time of the attack, Mrs. Somers',
who is the wife of George Somers, a junk
dealer, was on her way home. She en
countered the gang of hoodlums when
she had almost reached her own door.
They seized her and despite her screams
dragged her into a vacant lot.
Mrs. George Somers, a middle-aged Ger
man woman, was brutally assaulted last
nightly a gang of about ten Â¦ ruffians
near her home on Dore street, near Bry
ant. The woman was: subjected to the
most brutal: and revolting treatment, and
when Police Officer Patrick; Sullivan, at
tracted by the scuffle, ran to her rescue,
he found her almost dead from fright' and
from the beating she had received.- V

The small schooner Covina, which was lately

trip to El Campo yesterday, carrying a pleasure
party of more than 100 people.
Covina Makes Maiden Trip.
Tug Rescue Lays Up for Repairs.
The, Red Stack tug Rescue, which has for
some\time been hauling oil barges from Ven
tura to this ! port, has been laid up for re
pairs and the tugboat Monarch will take her
place. . . '
The British three-masted steel bark Baroda
arrived safely in port yesterday afternoon. In
tow of the : Spreckels. tugboat Defiance, from
Coos Bay. She was taken up to the Union
Iron. Works, where she will go into the dry
dock.
On the 20th of August, 1001, the bark Baroda,
bound from Callao to Portland, Captain Marr
In command, during a dense fog and a heavy
running inshore current, went ashore nine miles
south of Coquille River. The tide was running
very high at the time and left her firmly em
bedded in the sand. <
The English underwriters sent out a renowned
wrecker from Glasgow, -Captain' Burns, to get
her off, and on June 5 last his effort met with
success, and he floated her safely.
Captain Burns said â¢ yesterday that he- had
started with . the Baroda two days before from
Coos Bay, and that they had encountered heavy
fogs on the voyage. He deemed the condition
of the ship favorable, as she had only leaked
half an inch an hour, and was not badly
damaged. - .
Baroda Safely Towed to Fort.

ST. PAUL, June 22.â A passenger train
on the Sioux City branch of the Chi
cago, St. ' Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha
Railroad, due to arrive in St. Paul at
7:25 a. m., jumped the track near Ash
ton, Iowa, early to-day. Two trainmen
â¢were killed, five others seriously hurt,
and a ". number of passengers received
minor injuries. The dead:
C. J. Robinson, Sioux City, Iowa, mail
clerk.
Barrett, fireman, terribly scalded, died
shortly after being taken from under en
gine.
The injured; Jamea Erskine, " St.' Paul,
mail clerk, hurt about back and head,

The engineer of the; train., name not
ascertained, was badly hurt but will re

The passengers injured were attended
by surgeons who were brought to the
scene on a wrecking train, and, all were
able Ito continue their . journey.
The cause of the wreck is said to have
been a misplaced switch. The train was
running at a high rate of speed, and when
it left the track the 'mail cars and smoker
piled up on top of the engine.' The sleep
ing cars also left the track, but did not
overturn. The injured mall clerks were
brought to a St. Paul hospital, while the
others were | taken . to Minneapolis for
treatment. â¢ _,- - s

The Baron . has traveled extensively In
Africa and Asiatic Turkey, and has writ
ten a book entitled 'From the Mediter
ranean to the Persian Gulf" as a result
of his journeys. The book is profusely
illustrated with photos that he took
himself. He bears letters of introduction
to some of the 'representative citizens in
S*in Francisco.
On this account the Baron has been
sent to America to learn in what way the
United States Government and the Legis
latures of the respective States assist
roads here. He is also anxious to learn
wnat benefits are derived by a railroad
traversing a fertile country.
The proposeu road will be 2000 miles
long, from the present surveys, and will
be laid (through Assyria and Babylonia.
About 200 milea of the track has already
been laid out of Constantinople. The
Baron thinks it will be three or four
years before the road is finally com
pleted.
Among the arrivals at the Palace Is
Baron Oppenheim, Imperial Ger
man counselor of the legation at Cairo.
The distinguished visitor is detailed by
his Government to study the railway situ
ation in this country. A 'new railroad is
shortly to be constructed between Con
stantinople and the Persian Gulf. This
road will ! bo built by German capital,
and it will be under the supervision of

Mrs. Gonzales' story Is much at vari
ance with that told by her husband. She
claims to have had trouble with Gon
zales since their marriage on account of
the attentions he paid to other, women.
Yesterday morning, according . to . her
story, they were to go across the bay to
Gonzales Is a barber and resides at' 1218
Point Lobos avenue. His shop is located
at the same address. He says that his
wife when she fired theshiots was under
the influence of liquor' she had drunk
while grieving over the fact that, she
could not see her daughter Bessie, 14
years of age, who is in the custody of
Henry Schultze, Mrs. Gonzales' â¢ divorced
husband. The barber says he found his
wife In a stupor and chided her gently.
Soon afterward he was bending over a
basket of towels in the shop when she
shot at him from behind a portiere. She
then turned the pistol i on herself. Once
before, Gonzales says, she tried to shoot
herself.
Point Lobos avenue yesterday
afternoon. The shooting, according to
the woman's statement, was the- result
of extreme jealousy on her part, while
the man excuses her murderous act by
saying that Insanity from intoxication
was the occasion for it all; and ,he re
fuses positively to prosecute her> Gon
zales was shot in the back. The bullet
passed around his body and, tearing out
the inner lining of his pocket, was found
in that receptacle by the surgeons at the
French Hospital. Mrs. Gonzales was
struck in the left breast. The bullet split
on her shoulder blade and one portion of
it was extracted at the Park Emergency
Hospital, while the other was taken out
at the Central Emergency Hospital. /

The Idol's Eye," the Troll's record
production, will to-night be revived at
that popular house. The cast will be al
most identical with the cast of the last
production, with some small exception,
but the mountings aro to be new. Sybil
Page, a new soprano, will make her first
appearance in the part of Marguerite, and
Cashman has the Wheelan part of "Hoot
Mon." Ferris Hartman, ol course, ap-
The second week of the engagement of
E. J. Morgan and Maude Fealy at the
Grand Opera-house will be given over to
a grand revival of "The Two Orphans."
This perennial favorite of the melodrama
of romance will be produced with the ut
most elaborateness by the management.
The fine stage will be thrown open to its
farthest bounds, forming a space equal in
depth to the full depth of the large audi
torium. Mr. Morgan is cast as the cheva
lier. Miss Fealy as the blind girl Louise,
and the two stars will be ablv supported
by the house company. The play will'
doubtless draw largely, as it always does
with the regnant stars and handsome
settings, and will doubtless also be found
full of the thrill and 'excitement that its
romantic situations never fail to cause.
All kinds of interest attach to the new
Pinerft play to be given to-night at the
Columbia Theater. "The Gay Lord
Quex," by its astonishing run of 400
nights in London and corresponding suc
cess in New York when it was brought
to America by John Hare and Marie V an
brugh, compels at least a respectful at
tention. Henry Miller and Margaret An
glln have the leading roles of Lord Quex
and Sophy Fullgarney, the manicurist,
respectively, and in them have opportu
nity to exhibit the best that is in them.
Quex has been much of the earth, earthy,
but has achieved a' genuine reform
through love for a sweet young woman.
Muriel Eden. Muriel Eden (Grace Ellls
tcn) is the foster-sister of the mani
curist, who, being familiar with the
world's ways and the Quex reputation,
decides that the reformed lord is hot good
enough for her beloved Muriel. She de
termines therfore to break off the match.
An opportunity is afforded her by over
hearing an appointment made by a former
flame of Lord Quex to meet him to say
a sentimental farewell, this character,
the Duchess of Strood, offering a deli
cious chance to Miss Jennie Eustace,
whose stunning work with Mr. Miller
last season has left a grateful memory.
Miss Fullgarney, with all the low ma
chinery of which her class is capable, in
veigles herself Into the service of the
Duchess for an evening, and is discovered
by Quex and the lady at the keyhole of
her boudoir. . Then she in turn is trapped
by Lord Quex, who has happened to be
a perfectly innocent victim of the Duch
ess' freak of sentiment, and a very pow
erful scene takes place between the two.
The manicurist discovers that "the wick
edest man in London" is not so black as
he has been painted; Quex, that however
mistaken in her methods, the manicurist's
devotion to her foster-sister is deep and
sincere, and the end of the act finds the
queer pair almost friends. There are
many smaller parts of much merit, that
with' the brilliant company at the Colum
bia will be splendidly handled. There will
be an extra matinee on Wednesday.
Of the new numbers presented at the
Orpheum this week Dave Lewis is the
best. His German dialect is funny and
his dialogue clever. Frederick Hallen and
Mollie Fuller are old favorites, but "The
Sleep Walkers" is a trifle too somnambu
lent. Mr. and Mrs. Waterous are excep
tionally good operatic vocalists. Mr. Wat
erous has a rich, mellow voice and he
sings "cellar" songs with gusto. Jehan
Bedini caught no turnips >last night. He
juggled his way into favor and the audi
ence wondered who pays for the crockery
his assistant breaks during their act.
Swan and Bambard open the bill and do
some grotesque work. Mabel Sisson and
May Stewart present "A Mysterious Pill,"
a playlet the erstwhile firm of Barnes and
Sisson presented a year ago. Miss Stew
art is clever, but it is difficult for her to
play Barnes' part and do justice to it.
Eleanor Falk and company do everything
but the pajam^. dance. Loris and-Altina
continue their William Tell act. The bio
graph has some interesting pictures.
Frederick Warde, with Judith Berolde
and a good company, opens a short sea
son of the classic drama next Sunday
evening.- The opening play will be Boker's
"Francesca dx Rimini."
. The Eagles were out In force last night
at the California Theater on the occa
sion of the public welcome to James Neill
and some members of his clever com
pany who have lately joined the order.
The event was signalized by the presen
tation to Mr. Neill of a silver traveling
card, and of many beautiful floral offer-
Ings to the ladies of the company. The
gifts were presented by Charles F. Nagle,
president of the local. Aerie of Eagles,
after the second act of "Niobe," the bill
of the week, and were gracefully ac
knowledged by Mr. Neill for himself and
his confreres. "
This is the last week of the Neill en
gagement, and the bill chosen Is one that
should be very popular. The play kept |
the house in high good humor last nignt
with its many laughter-provoking situa
tions, and is particularly well cast and
acted. As Niobe, the statue that comes
to life, Galatea-fashion, Edythe Chapman
does excellent work, the artless, uncon
sciousness of the resuscitated Greek be
ing admirably given. Mr. Neill has the
role of Peter Dunn, who revives the
statue and is then compelled to heroic
prevarications to explain the strange
lady's presence to his wife, and the actor
gets much fun out of the part. Donald
Bowles is happy as Cornelius. Griffin, Ger
trude Kellar is conspicuously natural and
charming as Hattie Griffin, and Lillian
Andrews, as the shrewish Miss. Griffin,
does nobly. The rest of the cast is well
filled in, and the show should see good
business.
An inquest will not be held and the
body will be taken to Alameda for inter
ment. Before coming to this city sev
eral years aso the family lived in Wash
ington, D. C. The son is an attorney
here.
"I waited till after 6 o'clock," said Mr.
Crosby, "and then crossed the bay and
went to the Central police station. Th-3
officer in charge telephoned to the differ
ent sub-stations and to the Emergency
Hospitals, but could learn nothing about
her. 1 slopped in the city till 10 o'clock
making personal inquiries, and returned
home. I came across the bay this morn
ing and on the boat purchased a copy of
The Call and recognized my wife from
the sketch in the paper. When I went to
the Morgue my worst fears were con
firmed."
Crosby said his wife left their home,
1255 Versailles avenue, Alameda, to come
to this city to meet him and return home
with him. She had been for years a suf
ferer from heart trouble, but was feeling
very well Saturday morning. As she did
not meet him he thought she had
changed her mind, but when he got home
his son told him that she had gone across
the bay.
The body of the lady who died sud
denly on the ferry-boat Enclnal while
crossing the bay from Oakland Saturday
afternoon was identified at the Morgue
yesterday morning by H. T. Crosby, gen
eral service clerk at army headquarters
in this city, as that of his wife. He was
deeply affected when he saw the body
and could not speak for several minutes.
