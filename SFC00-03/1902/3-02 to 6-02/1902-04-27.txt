f\ f\ thing new to look askance at.
( V I And it is nothing mdre or lesg ;
VÂ» I than the summer hosiery. There
, Â¦ Â¦Â¦*Â¦ used to be a time when luxury â¢
in footwear was unheard -; of,'
but that time was long before our athletic
girl came into existence. .
' One must be difficult to please if a.
pattern cannot be found to suit, ""for there :
are all sorts and conditions; there are de
signs for those with unassuming- tenden
cies, others for the daintily Inclined,
while some are more" than elaborate and
still others just plain "loud." '-. â¢ '.- â¢
The most swagger^in'the' new styles ,
are white lisle embroidered-. in black. In
the East there is a clamor for the white
hose, but only the swtftfest of the swc-11
realize that white "Js>theV proper â¢ caper
here. The demand. Is? greater . than the
supply, though, as the â¢'" dealers were
afraid to bring out any great array. '
Most of these white ones are" imported
affairs, and they are every bit as , dainty i
as anything else that bears a foreign tag.
They are hand embroidered on the instep Â¦
betwen the lace open work or are covered,
with French knots. . \ ;.- . ' Â¦ : , ,.

ease, a combination that is hard to beat.
They axe specially suitable for the colo
nial ties or the low run-abouts are
to be worn so much this summer. Dame
Rumor whispers that even "the opposlie
sex have fallen a victim to, their' charms/
. and it is also whispered that, the \ open
work and embroidery is every whit as
dainty as is seen in my lady's.
I . One of the newest patterns is the "boot"-
I effect. Half of the stocking is black, but
\ the rest of it is white and pink embroid
\ try. The black is put on, not because it
I looks particularly pretty, but because, it
\ is serviceable. White hose are decidedly ;
I uncomfortable for* one reasonâ they are
' continually and forever soiled, or have
that appearance at any rate.
' The black boot takes away that look.
â¢ The skirt rubs exactly as much, but it
does not show on the black and the stock
ing looks as fresh after a walk as it did
before, and that is much more than one
Could say of all white.
. Ask your grandmother and see wha^ she
says. She will know all about it. - Â¦
There is another thing about these
black and white st6ckings. The colored
tcps and the black feet always have y a*
tendency to add to the size of the calf
and to decrease the size of the ankle, a
fact that always adds to theit popularity.
While all things look new, -there is
really nothing that- deserves that name.
There are stripes up and down and' the
same running round;, there are clocks anl
. open work; there are flowers and figured.
and what else is there left? I Not a thing.
Â¦A manufacturer once said, "Stripes' are
, swell about once in | four, or five years.
.When there is nothing else we'return' to.
them. ..One time we use them vertically
anc 1 the next time circling. But. really,
anything that has not been used for^a
number of years is new.'.' â¢ Â¦ ' v
So you see, while you may imagine that
your- hosiery is' awfully swell and awfully
new, you are mistaken. " i '
.For the iow, patent run-abouts black and
white stripes are -just about as swagger
as anything else. , There is one band of
silk and one of lisle, then eight of white
and one of black, .making the broad 'and
narrow effect.' They are pretty, but? they
do not: look well on a slender person. In
fact., no vertical stripes do. So let the
slight girl beware! ; .
Â¦â¢Another pair for iow shoes has a variety
of colors. The stripe effect is still carried
out, but not in such a pronounced fashion.
Between the bands of white; silk are
buckles "of green on the black background.
The'buckle part of it is really odd and it
has proved; remarkably catchy, .
Of course there are - some people â¢ who
will always wear black, and when one
Ififfij
comes to , think of It there Â¦ is nothing"
vmt>re dainty and ..prettier looking. The
lace, open work are quite the latest in
'â¢ black," but. all most terribly perishable.
Just a cobweb of lace 'that will tear with'
, the slightest' excuse, but to some people
v that only enhances their value. Â¦ *_Â¦ ' ,, '
Naturally silk hose are the (dream of
every girl, and, as a rule,' they are only a
/ dream. ! There is "a fit pair of light blue
and black.- The black forms the boot idea
in back and a suggestion of the same is
carried about to the front and;is used to,
make a ladder effect. The . top' part !is of'
the solid blue and is not of the open work
as, is the rest of it." They are simply the
- swellest ever and they, cost ; such a;
fancy priqe that no one need' ever think
they, will be common. There is no. such
good luck as that. Silk fits so snugly and
is so easy on the feet that it is irresistible.
Besides, there is that luster that is always
lacking in other hosiery, and that is desir
able.;. It is like taffetaa. There are all
â¢ kinds of imitations, but nothing- comes,
anywhere near it and everything else
looks like a grand bluff. .-> _
Â¦' The sock effect is carried i out in any
â¢ number of light colors. A pretty pair of
fancy ones is a combination of pink, white
.. and k black. 1 The black is the. ' back, as
usual, and the white forms the other half.
Just where the pink, black and white
should blend is a fancy strip of white
which completely encircles the .limb, and
above that comes the pink. ' They are not
peculiar looking at all,, but, are the ideal
hose to wear with these new slipper boots
which lace from the vamp to. the ankle.
That gives the stocking a chance to show
between the ribbon and the idea is* a cute
orie^ Â¦ .' '
The half hose is put together in numer
ous ways." Blue and white,, that is, dark
: blue and white, with the lighter color for
a \ background, is decidedly /nifty looking.
The darker shade forms the back .of the
ankle, the white and blue ladders the an
kle and the white forms the tops.
Arid, let me tell you something. When
ever you v see zigzags you may. know at
once that the stockings arc an expensive
pair. No matter how homely you may
consider them, they cost more money than
would seem warranted. And the reason is~
thip. The machine can make. only one
half of the. zigzag and the other half
must be. finished by: hand. That requires
. girls who understand their. business thor
oughly,' for the stitches must be just so
-'or else they' will' drop a.. thread" here and
j there and. r'uns', would be the consequence...
But therms "an6tKe"r~difficuIty to contend
â¢with as .well. ,. As -a rule such combina
tions are with light and dark colors and
the stitches are taken on the darker shade
which Is "i'most> trying to the eyes! ,There
are few girls who -.will: do' that bind of
work/ as ; their eyes, give out .completely.
' Two dozen pairs is about the limit, so
you may see how busy it keeps these large
manufacturers securing such .. labor.
So when you see your neighbor running
about with stockings of that description
you. may. put itdown that she is a good
judge of hosiery. v
. Pale pinks, dainty blues and white are
popular â¢ for boudoir .wear, and t with a
dainty kimono or a smart dressing gown
: make a very charming effect. ' High
| heeled 'French slippers are. advantageous

A unique 1 style has jjppeared.' that prom
ises to be popular. .' The background is
white.> just plain 'white, with no attempts
Â¦at any. gingerbread work.. Commencing
aUthe exact place where a low shoe stops
is a broad band of solid i>''w;k. The black
is zigzagged on either side so that the
Â¦ white seems 1 ragged as well." The. stripes

may imagine their width. There really, is
nothing pretty about them, but they are,
I* to say the 'least, a startling novelty.

C too gay, : has a happy medium in black
with some dainty little roses of pink and
red that are embroidered by. hand. In no
event are there more than, six, generally
three pink and; three red; but the pattern
changes just enough to give a slightly dif
ferent effect.
': These roses. are a French idpa and are
often put on in a Frenchy manner and
they arc just catchy enough to hold their
own. .Some dealers say they are too pori

STOCKINGS THAT ARE DREAMS OF BEAUTYAnother â¢ good -thing about Â¦ Cornelius'
religion was the practical turn "'it',' took.
Then in strong .tones he . heard the
words of Jesus - read â "I am .the 'Â¦ good
shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his
life for the sheep. I know my sheep, and
am known of -mine.' I- give unto them
eternal life, and they shall never per
ish, neither shall any men pluck them
out of , my hand." followed the
brief and earnest prayer, commending
the family to the Father's care and
thanking him for every good gift. In
closing the sweet voices of .'. the little
children united in the ; Lord's Prayer,
"the simplest form of speech that Infant
lips can try." : . . â¢
â¢ Did ever â¢Â¦ any. household, worshipers of
Buddha or followers of Confucius, begin
a day with a service like that? Shall we
compare themâ the dim searchlngs after
an unknown God, If haply they may find
himâ with the" clear shining of the true
light in Jesus Christ? Shall "we compare
the dreary hopelessness of any other
faith with the Â¦ everlasting .' consolation
and good hope through grace In : which
tin Christian rejoices? Rather, we will
say, as did one ( of the representatives of
the Chrlstlah ; faith in that congress, "I
possess a treasure : compared with , which
all else in the world Is as dross; a treas
ure so rich that I want to share It with
all -mankind."- -Â¦â¢" Â¦-Â¦* â¢-Â¦â¢ -â¢ â¢â¢ ---.--.. --...- .
Never did the words sound so sweet!
The contrast drew more and more impas

My never failing treasure, filled I
With boundless stores of grace!
And to the weary, rest!
saying of Jesus, "By their fruits ye shall
know them," and wonder how there could
be any one Id that audience, born and edu
cated In a Christian land, who could ap
plaud the utterances of the eloquent but
benighted Hindoo. Can It be possible that
any Intelligent woman has a word of favor
for a religion whose teachings are degrad
ing to her sex and- whose fruits are so
bitter In millions of hopeless lives? While
thinking thus a clear voice In an adjoin
ing room began to sing:
How sweet the name of Jesus sound!
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds.
And drives away his fear. .
It makes the wounded spirit whole.
It calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry aoul,
The patriarchs were priests in their own
families; so should every father be a
priest of God in his own family, minister
ing in holy things. The father has much
to do in making family religion possible.
St. Luke gives us In the book of Acts, In
the life of Cornelius, some idea of what
a father can do in making a Christian
home. After the preaching of Peter, when
Cornelius became a Christian, he brought
his whole family with him. Cornelius was
a good man; his religious life was such
as to give his children confidence in him.
They had faith in his piety and so his
teaching had some weight with them.
Cornelius "feared God"; his religious life
took hold of God and recognized his su
preme claims above mere struggling duty.
His religious life wasn't simply a matter
of respectability or humanltarianlsm; he
acknowledged all that was good in himself
and all that he might do for others was
Inspired of God, to whom he was respon
sible. Just imagine Cornelius saying "I
will be a respectable man, pay my honedt
bills and treat my neighbor on the
square." and then stopping there,' as
many do in our day. This recognizing of
God In one's religion, this emphasizing of
the divine above the human, Is essential,
would a father Impress his children for
real piety. A religion that Is all humani
tarian and without the spiritual and su
pernatural element will not prove of much
inspiration and- strength to. children The
same might be said of a religion that Is
all intellectuality. < Some years ago the
editor of one of the leading religious pa
pers of this country published In his paper
"One Morning's Meditations.", He had
picked up a daily, paper that morning
which was very suggestive to him. On the
first page appeared the sad announcement
of the death, by his own hand of one
whose name had long been familiar . Said
he, "Oh. the sorrow and pity of It for his
family and for himself It- opens- another
chapter in the record of human grief an
other channel for the floods of human
tears." But, turning the page, he read an
account of the Parliament of Religions In
Chicago, and an address from a disciple
of Buddha, How dreary it seemed not
withstanding the eloquence of the learned
Buddhist! "And he declares that his faith
so like an iceberg surrounded with fog, is
equal to, and In *Â¦ many respects better
than, the glowing faith of the. Christian!"
Where would Buddha help a woman in
sorrow like that of my friend? Where has
that religion ever offered comfort to any
of the millions of women, the wretched
widows who live always under, a; curse
where Buddha Is worshiped?- I recall the
interests of the child. Children should be
trained and educated to be a blessing to
the country as well as the home. That
this might be so, the foundation of a good
character must be laid in childhood. To
do this parents must be good themselves.
According to the fable, the mother crab
said to the daughter: "Go forward, my
daughter, go forward!" The daughter re
plied. "Good mother, do you show me the
way!" Whereupon -the mother, crawling
backward and sidling, as she was wont,
the daughter cried out^ "Ho, mother! I
go just as you do!" So does the life of
parents count far more than emptv words
in shaping the characters of their chil
dren. Example goes farther with children
than mere precept.
How\ different must have been the fam
ily, devotions in the home of , the young
man, one of a family of six boys, whose
father conducted , a large business which
demanded ! his constant attention, when
he is able to say: "My father's influence
over his boys is largely due to two things
âthe dally family altar, where his pray
ers made an impression upon us,, and the
Sunday ' afternoon l , talks and Â¦ readings
which we were accustomed to have with
him." "Who ' can estimate ; the influence of
the life of a, godly father? How much
we need a'generatlon of fathers like the
one a gentleman writes: about in the
American v Messenger. He Â¦ bears the ! fol
lowing-testimony: to the Influence of his
godly father:;. ; \ --,.--
I believe with President Hyde 'of Bow
doln College Â¦ that family worship- should
be like family lifeâ free and unconstrain
ed. Says President Hyde: "The aus
terity and somberness with which many
people conduct, family worship make the
children, dread rather than Â¦ love it." He
then gives an illustration which he knew
to have occurred in a strict Puritan house
hold. The only son, a Â¦ boy of 8 or ; 10
years, was . following as' best he, could
the morning ". lesson. Struck by some
startling _ and ; paradoxical Â¦ expression, fie
ventured to inquire: "Father, what does
that . mean?" "Hold ; your v gabble and
study your Bible," was the Â¦?Â¦ reassuring
and edifying .answer he 'received* And
yet I have no doubt that for the thirty
years that", followed, : in which that
â¢ son'took no interest and 'saw no beauty
in religion, .the father Was secretly pray
ing all the time for' hlg*. conversion and
wondering why his " prayers â¢ were not
answered. Our children 'muBt be taught
the masculine â¢ religion of, thought and
outward expression, as well a3 the -fem
inine religion -of sentiment and -, inward
feeling Â¦ If -they are: to go out from" our
homes to 'found Christian' homes of;thelr
own; if their religion is v to : stand the
wear and tear of: real life.
He "gave much, alms to the people."
Devotion to God cannot be genuine with
out devotion to our fellow men. Many a
father would impress his children more
favorably if his devotion should take a
more . practical ( turn. Then, Cornelius
was a man of prayer. ; He' "prayed -to
God alway." ( What a ! beautiful example
of a godly father we have in Cornelius,
leading his <â¢- family; in inquiring' after
God!. He besought God Â¦> continually for
his own salvation and /also that of his
family, which to him. was identified with
his own. :;â¢*- â " '
"If he did not walk in all the com
mandments and ordinances of the Lord
blameless he did so in an eminent de
gree. He was a farmer, . in the common
walks of life, and was content with his
lot. Religion was with him the supreme
thing. It was his belief that the chief
end of man was to glorify God and to â¢
enjoy him, forever, â¢- and this he sought
to do. "He had his f amilv altar, on which
Incense â¢ was ; daily . offered, j both, morning

dren in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord, and * was . an example to them . by
his own godly - walk. ;. He taught them
to regard the Sabbath as ", the Lord's
day,- and required 1 them, to keep It- In a

Samuel, fhe servant of God.-was the son
of praying parents. .Timothy, the friend

One great secret of, the mother's influ
ence over her children is the faith they
have In -her and their love for her, what
ever her life: This is one reason for tha
truth of Emerson's saying: '.'Men are
what their mothers made â¢ them." -. This
story is told of one of the sons of Em
peror William' of Germany: Tha court
preacher was Instructing him - In ; some
matters at Biblical doctrine. The preach
er told him that all men were sinners, and
in need of a Savior. ' "Is that true," said
the boy, "of kings, princes, and other
great people?" "Yes," 7 was the preacher's
response, "it is true of kings and princes
as well as peasants.". The young prince
was silent for awhile, and then he an
swered: "Well, it; may be true 'of my
father, but I am sure it is not true of my
mother!',' That was a noble tribute to a
noble mother;, but the great' danger Is
that so many, children look about the
same way upon their, mothers who are
not the Christian character. she is. What
made the, prince's such a mother was the
saving grace of God. The young prince's
own sweef mother is said to be what she
ls^-a- woman of highest honor,- of spotless
life, and queenly service, - through her
faith in Jesus Christ.
Mrs. L. H. Slgoumey writes :
And say to mothers, what a holy charge la
theirs;
"With what kingly powers their love
Might rule the fountain of new born mind;
Warn them to wake at early dawn and sow
Good seed before the world has sown Its tares.
What greater blessing can a father have
for himself, , or bequeath . to the world,
than children with Christian integrity
whose good influences multiply in all di
rections from each one of their lives.
How much more the mother has to do
with the moral atmosphere of the home
than the father. It is mainly she who
shapes the home influence and imparts to
it its prevailing atmosphere. This is seen
in her influence over her children. A
mother with genuine, hearty, loving trust
in God, and whose life is full of faith
meekness and obedience to the will of
God, will exercise great power over her
sons and daughters. They can never get
away from the sweet memory. that Christ
was their mother's Friend and Lord.
â¢Her children rise up and call her bia
sed."
are such as every Christian parent might
well desire that his children should cher
ish concerning him."
The life of such~a father cannot fail to
reap its fruit for God in due season. A
father could bequeath no better legacy to
Em cnlld i"en than such a godly example
which is infinitely better than gold and
silver or any other earthly good.
Happy Indeed that child who can say
with Cowper:
My boast is not that I deduce my birth -
.From loins enthroned, or rulers of the earth;

The son of parents passed Into the skies.
There are strong and timely words. I
would that every parent might have them
written !n letters of gold and hung in a
conspicuous place in the home. God, who
Instituted the family, has commanded
that his words should be cherished In the
hearts of parents, that they should teach
them diligently unto their children. "Thou
Fhalt talk of them when thou slttest In
thine house, and when thou walkest by
the way, when thou liest down and riseth
up." Diligently, patiently, prayerfully,
daily are parents to impress the truth of
God upon their children. The religious life
of children must be carefully guarded and
cultivated.- -The Intellectual and physical
must not be placed before * the spiritual
This is indeed a painful truth, and is
fraught with serious consequences to both
parents and children. It is claimed by
some that there is a decline In church at
tendance and it is regretted as a 'serious
thing, but a more serious danger con
fronts us in the decline 6f family religion.
It is a very dark outlook for both church
and country when home religion is laid
aside. "Can it be a home, a child's home,
without religion?" asks Rev. G. S.
Reaney, and then he answers in these
forceful words: "It -must be a house,
beautiful, enriched with art. knowledge
and music; but without religion, without
thoughts about God, without prayer, pen
itence, pweet Sabbath, faith, love and
seeking after a life of holiness â it cannot
be a home. This needs no argument. It
needs much emphatic repetition and it
needs deep belief. All children are natur
ally religious. They have wonder, awe,
reverence, trust, tenderness, the keenest
serfe and love. No "learning' comes so
naturally to a child as the learning of
God. The talk of children about God is as
the talk of wise men. There must be reli
gion if there is to be a home. We who
are afking that all education shall be re
ligious, are. of all people, bound to see
that our children find their first faith,
their first prayer, their first thought of
God,, at home. When the schoolmaster
gets our boys he ought to find that there
is one elementary thing: In their education
well begunâ re'ldor.. To send a boy or
i?ir! into the *r?w world' of a school with
out prayer, fa'th. love, reverence and
some experience toward God. Is to send
those most precinus to us into their first
day into the world and In life as unfitted
for that world and for that life as a hea
then child."
A distinguished missionary recently. In
a letter printed in the Advance, expressed
his keen sorrow at the decline of family
worship. He states that before he depart
ed from this country for the mission
fields In 1859 he doesn't remember of a
Christian home in which family worship
Â¦was not observed daily. He declares,
however, that on his recent visit he find*,
to the sorrow of his heart, instead of the
former prevailing custom now there Is no
gathering of the family tor worship â¢ of
God. He bases his statement on the ob
servations of the Christian homes in
Â¦which he has been entertained. :
The vrork of child salvation must begin
in the fair I y. Nothing <Is^ cm ub titu o
for the home work. Even the thuich iÂ«
only to supplement the training of thr>
home, which is to be kept as the holy of
holies. Home religion is the truest, most
beautiful, most lasting and most difficult
type of religion. The better the home the
stronger the church and better the con
dition of the country. The nation that
ignores the sacredness of the home has
nothing like common morality, and its
government cannot be permanent. We
are living In a critical timeâ a period
when there was never a greater need of
home religion. There are great wrongs to
be made right and terrible evils to be
crushed. We must find the secret of true
reform at the fireside. Many of the youth
of our land are going out into the busy
world with no decided convictions on re
ligion; they are indifferent to the calls of
the church and of God. and are being
swept along with the tide of mere world
liness. Our time demands Christian
character of the purest and" sturdiest
type. To have this we must have real
Christian homes. To have these, parents
must walk in holiness of heart before
God. It is to be feared that family re
ligion is on the decline, and the family
altar is not so common among profess
edly Christian homes as It has been in the
past.

Here is the first impulse given to all the
best possibilities of the religious life. Im
morality and incivility will increase to the
digree that a people depart from the high
Ideate of the Christian home. Dr. A. J.
Oooke says: "Never will there be that
piety, that serious devotion to religion in
the church, until tremendous importance
is attached to the religious culture and
experience of children."
Then how essential it is that the home
be well grounded in the word of God.
that family religion be of a pure anri
happy type. "God meant when he made
us." says the Rev. Dr. Theodore Cuyler,
'"that we should live in families. There
is no such school of true religion on the
globe as a well governed, God-honoring
home; it underlies both the church ana
the commonwealth. The most primitive
of all churches is the church in the
home. There stands the domestic altar;
there is felt a Christian culture, which
molds character from the cradle clear on
to the judgment seat. It is the nursery
of .he noblest lives. It is the earliest anJ
sur-. st preparation for the home not made
with hands â eternal in the heavens. Out
Cram many an humble farmhouse, which
hau only a calico curtain in the winnow
and a rag carpet on the floor, has gradu
ated the noble manhood which has iU.eJ

rTvHE home institution being so close-
I My identified with the life of church
I Â¦ and state, the character of its in-
I :fluence depends largely upon the
X â¢ moral atmosphere pervading the
home. Lying, as the home does, as the
foundation stone of all civilization, ami
being as it is the guarantee of all that
is good and permanent in government,
there can be nothing more vitally im
portant than homes of real piety. "De
moralize the family," says one, "and you
thereby destroy both domestic and na
tional happiness and undermine complete
Iy the temple of virtue and hope, and pre
pare the way for moral and civil desola
tion." . v - *
Illustrious sons was never effaced. Bishop
Hall had reason to thank God for a moth
er who taught him much divine truth and
gave him many pious lectures. Dr. Dodd
ridge's mind never lost the impression
" made upon it by the wise and piou3
teaching of his godly mother. She taught
him the history of the Old and New Tes
taments before he could read. John Quin
cy Adams, not long before he died, was
visited by a gentleman who said to him:
"I have found out who made you." "What
do you mean?" he asked. "I have been
reading the published letters of your
mother." The old man's eyes, it is said,
flashed brightly, as he rose and said in his
peculiar way: "Yes, sir: all that is good
in me I owe to my mother." His mother
wrote to him when twelve years of age:
"I would rather see you laid in your grave '
than to grow up a profane and. graceless
boy."
Abraham Lincoln's mother died when
he was a mere lad. and yet her influence
upon him was imperishable and ineradi
cable. Not long before h!s lamented
death he said, with his eyes dimmed with
tears and his voice tremulous with emo
tion, "All I am or can be I owe to my
angel mother."
One of the secrets of John Ruskln'3
power and charms in literature is that
his mind was early saturated with Bible
teaching. He tells us that every morning
his mother closeted herself with her son,
and no one was allowed to Â¦ interrupt
them. Each morning he learned a few
verses of the Bible by heart, and repeat
ed two or three chapters to her.
John Randolph said only one thing ever
saved him from atheism; that was tha
tender remembrance of the hour when a
devout mother, kneeiing by his side, took
his little hand in hers and taught him to
say, "Our Father, who art in heaven."
So subtract from the men and women
whom we are pleased to "call" great all
they owe to the, influence of the mothera
who bore and bred them, and the giants
will be left as pigmies. The power and
authority with which . they speak is but
an expression of the influence of their
first teacher-mother. They have received
their stimulus to all their excellence and !
usefulness from pious mothers .
This is not mere- sentimentalism, as
some may be inclined to consider it, but
real, downright godly living in the home
we are pleading for. The memory of
mother lingering thus with her children
should be a holy one, which will abide
when all else is forgotten. It is sacred
and sweet while mother lives, and a per
petual inspiration when the bright flow
ers bloom above her sleeping ashes. The
sons and daughters; look upon such a
mother as an incarnation of goodness.
But think of the baneful influence upon
the children when their parents have no
concern whatever for their religious life.
Many parents are so" absorbed in business
pursuits, in becoming rich or in seeking
their own pleasure that they not only
neglect their own spiritual interests, but
those of their children. If many children
get any religious instruction it must come
from outside the home. So many parents
are careless concerning their own lives
while their children are growing up; they
are expecting much from their children,
while they fail to set the right example.
Think of a father saying that he has not
prayed in his home or read the Bible for
twenty-five years! The mother has also
been as careless and indifferent concern
ing the religious training of the children.
The children have never known the hal
lowed influence of a Christian home, nor
have they ever had the Inspiration to holy
living that comes from the mlnistriea of
the sanctuary of God. We are shocked
at the way the heathen world exposed
their children, to danger. At the very
time Jesus was taking children in his
arms and blessing them the heathen
world was offering its children to Moloch,
exposing them on thÂ« highways or bring
ing them up for vi'.e purposes in licentious
worship of the gods when prompted by
motives of lust or gain or economy. The
, rights of. children had but little recogni
tion. But even in our day many parents
seem totally indifferent to the claims ot
childhood. -'Sa.yÂ». Walter Thomas Mills:
"."The -rights* of children are not recog
nlzed'when 10,000 children in Chicago are
bearing -the burdens of as many men and
are beset with temptations that no man
ought to face. 'Suffer little children,' said
our Lord, and we suffer them to go about
our streets with begrimed faces, tattered
clothes and bare feet, besmeared with to
bacco and bearing the stench of the grog
shop on their breath."
It doesn't make much difference with
multitudes of children whether they are
in the home or out of it; for the moral
influence of their homes (?) is no better
than what they find on the street or in
unhallowed places. Their first tempta~
tion to wrong comes within their own
homes. These children are what they are
made â they are more to be pitied than
censured. We might as well turn chil
dren loose to the outside contaminating
forces of the devil as to bring the devil to
them into the home In the form of social
evils.
The devil and all his forces are arrayed
against the childhood of to-day. And if
the parents or guardians are careless and
negligent of their holy trust there can be
but little hope for the rising generation.
The children will be tempted from with
out; they should never be tempted in the
home. To-day many sons and daughters
are eating the ashes of the apples of the
dead sea. There is nothing left to them,
worth living for. They can't much longer
fight against the odds. Every hand pushes
them nearer the bottom, and by and by
the end comes. Trace back their down
ward course and you will find the testi
mony of many is, "My parents taught me
to drink wine like a> lady or gentleman.*'
How sad that the lives of so many chil
dren and youth are sacrificed to the ques
tionable social customs of the times! We
are so much inclined to run from one ex
treme to another. The purity of the horns
must be preserved. -
To accomplish this the reading matter
of the children must ' be carefully
watched. Nothing Is doing more to wreck
the lives of childhood, to enfeeble their
minds, poison their hearts, making the
wholesome restraints of home and re
ligion burdensome and hateful than per
nicious literature. How criminally careless
are many parents in this matter of read
ing. The dally newspaper has the free
right of way in most homes. Now, not
every dally newspaper .is fit to circulate
freely among children.- Even in some of
the most wholesome newspapers there Is
much matter that has a tendency to en
feeble^ the mind and pollute the heart,
and the child must be kept from it. The
most dangerous of all reading is a page
of poison diluted with a grain of moral
teaching, whether found In the newspaper
or the gilt-edged book. Some parents are
more oareful as to .what their children
eat or wear than what they read; but
what they read has more to do with their
success In life than anything else. When
children become Interested in first-class,
high-toned literature they are well start
ed on the highway of safety.
All this will take timeâ a very precious
commodity with most parents: but to
what more profitable use can you put it
than In saving your boys and girls from
open disgrace and preventing them from
being dragged Into the mire of sin.
Harriet M. Morris writes in a most tell
ing manner on this Important theme In
one of - our periodicals. She expresses
herself - as ' sadly conscious that thou
sands of j mothers are so overburdened
that the actual demands of life from day
to-day consume all . their time and
strength. ."But," says she, "of two
evils choose the least; and which would
you call the leastâ an unpolished stove
or an untaught boy? Dirty windows or
a child whose confidence yon have failed
to gain? Cobwebs In the corner or a son
over whose soul ' a crust has formed ao
strong that you despair of melting' It
with your hot tears and your fervent
prayers?" She further states: "I have
seen a woman "who was absolutely Ignor
ant â¢ of her children's habits of thought,
who never felt that she could spare a
half-hour. '.tc* read or talk to them. I
have seen > this - woman spend ten min
utes in Ironing a sheet f there were six
In the washing), one; hour in fluting the
ruffles and 'arranging' the puffs of her
little girl's 'sweet white dress.' thirty
minutes polishing ' tln3 which . were al
ready bright and clean, forty minutes In
frosting and decorating a cake for tea,
because 'company' was expected."
Parents should ever keep.hiJmind that
God will hold them responsible for the
spiritual . well-being ot their children.
Parents are in duty bound to guide their
children, in the heavenly way. They may
not be able to save the children of all
the world, but the least they can do is
to make sure of the children of their own
households. , God's period is that of ch.*ld
hood; that period should be .wisely used
by. parents. .

WHEN a young boy. hardly fit
to be called a youth, starts out
on life's journey, his first
thought nearly always Is of all
what he will be and what he
will do. When one looks at the road at
life all is even, smooth and straight and
. the trees and flowers bloom along the
path, when there appears before th<?
youthful traveler's eyes, two / separate
roads branching- from this one. One looks
pleasant, smooth and, in fact, a continu
ation of the first, but at the end there are
pitfalls, traps, and these come when It Is
too late to turn back. The other looks
rough and uneven at the start, but only
a. little way on reappear the flowers and
trees of the main path. This is not to
. fchow that every boy ha* had luxuries in
hie Infancy and in his boyhood, but to
illustrate the advantages the majority
of them have had. To look at the most
important advantages we find; First, the
guardianship and training given to us by
our parents; second, the period we have
had for improving our mind and charac
ter for the time when we shall have to
fight the battles of life.
If a boy has followed up these advan
tages he may be pretty sure to know
what he is going to be with no need to
hope for it. Nearly all boys have vain,
wild drearcs of "when I grow up to be a
man." This is true with myself, for as
yet I em only a boy. I have good par
ents. Some boys have not. And by the
help of God alone I know what I shall be
The subject, "What I hope to be," is
a rather peculiar one, including a va
riety* of hints for every boy who has to
start himrtlf in life.
Looking. into own near future, I see
these Questions appear, namely: First,
Is my manhood to be a useful one? Sec
ond, am I going to be a vagabond or an
honored, respected man? Third, how shall
I mrfke mine a useful life?
My manhood can be and is going to be
a useful one If I try to make it so.
If I am rich I have but few chances to
be great unless 1 put myself on a level
with the poor, struggling boy who is sure
to succeed. Supposing I happen to be
poor, my character, formed from infancy,
will show what I will be. Take a look
at the great m*>n of our countryâ McKin-
U?y, Lincoln, Garfield. Clay and many
others. Non<? of these celebrated men
were born of rich parentsâ yet to-day,
though three of them have been brutally
;u^as.sinated., their nann-s live now and
will !ive forever.
Abraham Ltreoln had none. of the op
pcrtunities wbi< h many a boy has to-day
yet he became ciiief executive of a split'
qiarreling nation and a savior to what
v.a- then thought to be a degraded ln
. ferior class of people. How did he be
come so great? It is true that his mother
trained him. But he alone formed his
noble, honest character and swelled his
already great heart to have pity on thÂ»
Â«sia\ - es.
So myself and every boy in the world
struggling to be something need not hope
for it. He may be certain that if he keeps
â¢way from bad company, abstains from

thought of the future it was at
an ape when the mind Is hardly capable
of grasping such a proposition or forming
any definite plan for a direct path in life.
Even now, at the age of 14, many might
not consider me sufficiently endowed with
the mature mental capacity necessary for
such a s-ep. or the experience needed to
render such an important decision. Such
views which I may express, therefore. I

I smile when I think of the many ca
reers which four year's ago were the off
springs of my then very youthful imagin
ation. That imagination, so vividly col
ored, was like a gigantic hand with a
hundred fingers, each of which struck a
different chord up the extensive gamut
of trades and professions. First, being
romantic to a superlative degree, I would
be an actor, and fanciful pictures of a suc
cessful stage career swam before me in a
dazzling light. As I grew older something
more stable entered my mind, and partly
from being teased and partly from com
mon sense I heroically resigned my ro
mance to the Olympian heights whence
it had entered my brain. Then, for
about a year, there was no particular bait
which tempted me to adopt another pro
fession. 1 joined a debating club in '9S.
At latt we have come to the root. This
.was the turning point that concentrated all
my ideas to the profession which I think
is the grandest, noblest and most com
mendable on earth, next to medicine â the
law! Defending the oppressed from per
secution, revealing to the world the guilty
with the strong arm of Justice is certainly
a position any honorable man would be
proud to occupy. Our greatest men were
lawyers^â Clay, Jackson, Calhoun. Web

his business they should have made a
mental note of it. Again, when he gave

that should have been remembered. And
at the last, when he closed with his in

forgotten it. Those were the four points
of importance in what he said and any
one who did ; not give a hint that each
one of those ideas- had stuck in his or

The first question read, "What is his

one point was taken away from, the pupils
who. could not tellâ for that question was
not so much a matter of observation at
the time as It was a matter of general in

heavy penalty: "Has he a beara or a

any noticeable scars on his face or

BY MRS. E. P. SCHELL.
The selection of the proper time to lead
trumps is one of the most important con
siderations in whist strategy.
The degree of skill displayed in the
management of trumps is the surest way
of showing your ability as a player.
The student cannot attain proficiency
until he has learned to count trumps and
to remember 'their rank.. -This will- be
more difficult than in plain suits, owing to
fourth best leails, irregular leads and. the
follows. It must be remembered that it
is 'most important to bear in mind the
card turned, especially if it is an honor.
The rules for leading trumps which
have been promulgated by whist writ
ers ure ap numerous that they are very
confusing to the student. Here are a few
rules set down' by the more modern writ
ers, which are of very great hefp in the
management of trumps.
With live or more trumps and good
plain suit, lead trumps. With five trumps
and a re-entry in another suit, lead two
rounds, being careful of the third round.
With four trumps, established suit and
card of re-entry, lead from four trumps.
With three of each plain suit and four
trumps, the safest lead is usually trumps.
Here is a question which. is being dis
cussed by the advanced whist., players:
Whether it is best to lead from the four
trumps, if your three-carded plain suits
are all weak, or to open the top of one of
the weak suits, as a strengthening card to
partner's suit? You may only be In
creasing their average value for your ad
versary by leading trumps.
Miss Wlieelock says, if your partner
opens with deuce of trumps, showing four
trumps, and three, cards in plain suit,
you holding first trick, It would be wiser
to establish your own suit before return
ing trumps.
When strong in all plain suits, though
weak in trumps, it is usually best to lead
trumps, compelling the other suits to be
led up to you and thereby increasing
their Â¦ value. When very strong in â¢ one
suit, good in defense in another and
weakness in the third suit, many good
players will finesse the third suit and
lead from weak trumps, especially If they
have three cards in weak suit and cannot
hope to trump it. Leading from one
trump a player takes a great risk; it must
be of high value, so, that his partner can
read that It is irregular. To do so he
must have an established suit and ade
quite re-entries, as he must have confi
dence that his play will result advan
tageously. As a rule, however, none but
experts who can read the cards closely
can practice this with safety.
One of the most unsound conventions,
happily losing its vogue, is the signal by
the leader for his partner to play through
an honor turned. If the leader's hand
justifies a trump opening he should lead
it at once, # regardless of the honor
turned. Many tricks are lost by signaling
for trumps through the honor, as . your
opponents will take advantage and force
you, sometimes establishing a " cross-ruff
to your undoing. The only advantage it
has is in the ability of your partner tak
ing the first trick and putting your sig
nal Into' execution.

Trick 7â North still has two- re-entries

him. He was probably right, however,

Trick &â North knows the queen must
drop this time, and can read that south
has one more diamond to put him, in

severe, 'I'd hate to feel that your obser

moon,' returns Colonel Sterett, 'cannot be
deemed wonders in any proper sense.
They're merely interestin' details. whLh

is lazily tannin' himse'f with a barn door,

that coolin' purpose. The wizard don t
say nothin', but he does turn a mite pale,
he sees with hair a eye that Satan him
se'f would be he'pless once Chet gets als
two paws on him. However, he assoomes
that he's out to give the show as per
"schedoole.
! "It's makin' toward S when the wizard
lights a seegyar, drink four tinge, s cf Wil

Hall. Chet gets up, hangs the barn door
back on its hinges, an' sa'n.tet 3 after.
Squar" Alexanders had posted CMet as to
his dooties, an' his orders is to c'llect the
necromancer if he offers to enter the hall.
That's how the cavalcade lines up: First,
the wizard; twenty foot behind is Chet,
an' twenty foot behind our giant con
stable comes the public in a body.
"â¢About half way to Liberty Hall, the
wizard begins to show nervous and uncer
tain. He keeos lookin' back at Chet; an'
even in my childish simplicity, I sees that
he ain't pleased with the outlook. At
last. he weakens an' abandons his Idee
of a show. Gents, as I fills my glass, I
asks you-all however. now do you reckon
that wizard beats a retreat?"
"Thar's no reply. Dan, Texas an' the
others, while Colonel Sterett acquires his
llcker, shakes their heads dumbly, as
showin' they gives up.
" 'Which you'd shorely never guess!' re
torts the colonel, wipin* h!s lips. 'Of a
sudden, this wizard tugs something outen
his pocket that looks like a bal lof kyar
pet rags. Holdin' one end, quick as
thought, he tosses the ball of kyarpet
rags Into the air. It goes straight up on
til lost to view, onwindin' itse'f in Its
flight because of the wizard holdin' on to
the end. *
â¢â¢ 'Gents, that ball pf kyarpet rags never
does come down no more! An' It's all
done as quick as a set-lock rifle! The
wizard climbs the danglin' string of
kyarpet rags, hand over hand; then he
drifts on* an" up'ards ontil he don't look
bigger than a bloo-bottle fly; an' then
he's lost In the gatherin' shadows of the

Enright, an' the old chief is grave as be

sponds the wizard. "I don't savey no

" ' "Look at them bills," says Squar'
Alexanders, an' he pints to where one is

a picture, too, of the foul fiend, with

It was a very short lifeâonly two years
-but it had lasted long enough for the

old gray; cat were true to each other, and
the loyalty lasted even in death.
The cat traced the child, who had disap-

Ever since B^aby Fuzihowia has been old
enough to call anybody the cat has been
used to hear the child-voice calling for it
all over the house. The cat always an-
swered promptly, for it loved the baby. In
fact, whenever they were separated there
were walls that arose from both ends of
the house; the lisping, stuttering, broken
Japanese cries arose to meet the mourn-
ful mews of the old gray cat. If an inter-
vening door were opened they would rush
to each other s arms, or paws, with a tor-
rent of loving Japanese gurgling and
loud, contented purring.
They lived in a happy little country
home near Alviso. It was a quiet home.
and it was very seldom that they found
any other playmates than each other. Mr.
Fuzihowia, the baby's father, is a pros-
perous countryman, who thinks the coun-
try a very good place : for little people.
and he has never bothered himself much
about the social needs of his family. And
so they have found friends as they could,
and the 2-year-old child, the baby of the
flock, fell back upon the cat for compan-
lonship, and found more than most of us
find in our human friends.

PHYSICAL culture for women in
/California is an absolute necessity.
To some the evenness of the cii
matf Is pr.ervating. To others it
allows th'at voluptuous indolence
that leads quickly to fat.'and fat is the
very curse of beauty.

of the new physical culture movement.
Muscle In men is a splendid quality, ad-^
mired by all women. Muscle "In women ;
is admired by neither sex. In truth, noth

with gnarled 'and knotted sinews. Such'

the reverse degree there is noUilng quite
so fascinating as the perfectly developed;

Of course this perfect poise Is not pos

of course women will not take 'the' trouble
to develop their strength unless the aI- ;

without interfering in any way with
her duties as hostess at these exnly
fcively feminine functions.
Indeed She grace culture circle is

particularly alluring, for where mi

interest in her boudoir exercises with
pulley weights and dumbbells and her

can now combine all the fascinations

dainty but substantial- luncheon, ap
peals to even the most sluggish dis
positions. Besides it is an excellent
excuse/ to wear neat; natty and â¢ be
coming costumes. Add to this that
each movement is given a bign.
sounding sud artistic name, and it is
easy to understand how and why ttie
new culture circles have gained sucli
great vogue.
Of course these are only a few of the
n?ny exercises to secure grace and beauty
that have. made the new physical culture
system such, a big-, success with women.
Everything ia harmonyâ the music, the
costumes, the exhilarating movements
and even all the pretty names by which
each is known. And when the women
can meet under such pleasant circum
stances is it any wonder that grace-cult
ure has -become such a fascinating- fad? '
To give poise to the whole body and
especial ease and" grace pf movement to
the hands and arms there- are many im
itation, artisan "exercises that are full of
dignity .> and grandeur. .One of themâ
"Mowing"â shown in lh,e single picture at
the bottom of this page, is the most popu
lar of. all. The movements are precisely
the same as those actually used in work
in the field.
The next beneath it is tne "Turkish sa
lute," another whole-body exercise, which
is executed to slow, dreamy music To
accomplish It properly you must have
your nerves and muscles under perfect
control. With arms extended make a
deep salaam, throwing the right foot be
hind the left and sinking to a sitting
posture. Then stoop forward until the
head rests on the floor. Rise again with
the arms still extended. This "exercise is
Intended particularly , to strengthen the
spine and the waist and reduce the hips.
It has in it, however, all the elements
of grace that makes all these movements
so popular.
Another form of this . same exercise,
which, however, Is intended to devitalize
instead of tense the. muscles, is the
"ladles' salute," shown on the bottom of
this page. Though primarily for grace
and ease of movement it is a true test of
strength and .elasticity. To execute it
throw the right foot far behind you, sink
slowly down until ydu are seated upon It
with the left leg still extended straight
before you; place the left hand lightly on
the bosom and salute your partner with
a graceful wave, of the other. Rise again
as slowly as you sank down.
This : . is very beautiful Indeed to tie
music of an. old-fashioned minuet.
Another of the heavier sort is "The
Anvil"' which is executed to the rhythm
of slow-measured music. It is a shoulder
exercise, ' designed to harden all the
muscles. â¢ It generates and mag
netism and develops the lungs and all the
sinews of the back. When given with a
vim nothing could be more suggestive ot
latent force and at the same time so
graceful as this imitation artisan exercise.
of grace and proves one's ability to bal
ance evenly on either foot.". Needless to
say all women like it best.

readers of your beauty sermons.
"MRS. B. S. J."
Beth of these readers suffer from the
fame trouble, namely that of increasing
weight. True, they do not complain of
adipose tissue, but only of an inconven
ient fullness in certain 'places.
But that means fat, and fat of the
worst kind.
If it were only possible to make flesh
settle in becoming spots, then we would
all of us have less to complain of. If
w? could make fat dispose of itself grace
fully, going above the belt. Into the
cheeks and bust and upper arms, and
below the belt into the hips and calves,
then fat would be pretty and graceful.
But, unfortunately, flesh has a way of
doing as it pleases. It gets Into the chin
and doubles it; and it rounds out the ab
domen unpleasantly. At the same time
it makes a pufiineEs around the eyes, so
that they decrease in size, and it gives
even the forehead a .shiny, full look.
A Fat Waist. *
Sometimes, worse fat of all. It goes to
the waist and makes it big, depriving the
figure of all grace; and it gets under the
collar band so that there is litle or no
neck.
The woman whose waist has grown so
large that It is unsightly, and the one
whose neck Is so chubby that she has to"
wear a soft ribbon around It.ln place of a
collar, these are the two women who are
in the worse of predicaments from In
creasing fat.
For the woman with the big waist there
Is nothing to be done short of heroic
measures. Let her get into an outing"
suit and try the oxygen cure. She must
breathe the fresh air nearly every, wak-
Jnsr hour of the day, and ehe will find
that, in the course of reiiuccon, the very
breathing of cool, fresh air will help.
; Let the woman with the big waist keep
her windows open, let her sit on thÂ«
piazza, and let he'r, more than all, take
exercise.
Is she a golfer? Nc? Then let her
learn at once. Let her get a neat short
skirt and get out on the links. Let her
go over them alone once a day, knock
ing the ball ahead of her.
If you are the woman, and if you are
reducing and have no links, then get a
bicycle. The sport is as good for jou
as it ever was. and the cycle Is so cheap
that you can afford" an up-to-date one.
The Outdoor Sports. ~
' Take up tennis, no matter how old you
are; try croquetâ do anything and every
thing that keeps you out in the air. The
only women in the world that, never grow
fat are those that work out of doors.
And those who fatten the quickest are
those who work in the heat, over a cook
stove, laying on false flesh and growing
narrow of lungs as they broaden in the
abdomen. â¢
But perhaps you have no. links, no ten
nis court, no chance to do anything but
cycle. Bo you must exercise indoors.
Then "take, to the gymnasium. 'â¢ Convert
one room in the house to gymnasium pur
poses. Or organize .a physical culture
club and hire a room for the practice
thereof. You can really ' do without all
implements except the few that you take
with you., The hanging rings, the,vault
ing pole and the horizontal bar are: r.x-'
cellent and more than' excellent,', but you
can do without them, If you must.
Let one of* your exercises be : with 'the
golf stick. This' can be'. procured in \ a
moment and the ball is to be picked up
anywhere. The very getting into. the right
position .will exercise you a little and you
will find 'that, it requires', some] practice,
to balance yourself well and to -give the
right swing.
Lift the : ball again and again' and then
Â¦stop to get your breath while the other
player tries her skill. You will soon find
yourself indulging In little friendly -com- "â¢'
bate, and the exercise, If practiced with
open windows, broadens the lungs; -gives
you goodrlong, deep breaths and exer
cises the j shoulders; and ribs. *The ribs
specially are brought Into play In swing
ing the golf sticks. â¢â¢'; . ,'

For the neck nothing will do but neck
exercise. Try the vaulting 1 pole. The
head will swing as you leap and you
will get a slim throat very soon. Do not
drink after exercising, but lie down and
rest, and, if very thirsty, take the Juice
of an orange. ?
A correspondent writes to know what
she shall drink when thirsty, as she has
formed the habit of taking a sip of water
every few minutes. And water certainly
does fatten.
This woman can do only one thing
learn to do without drinking between

of apple, a piece of orange, a sip of grape

make them look thin. A very stout
woman, with a neck too plump, may wear
the black band to advantage, but the thin
woman should wear a string of pearls or
gold beads.
Jewels should be worn with regard to
color. HIgrhly colored gems, rubles and
emeralds do not look well with shades of
blue and red, but show' best with pearl
color or white; topaz harmonizes with
browns and yellow. The pearl is of all
precious stones the likeliest to soften tho
face. Diamonds detract from the brill
iancy of eyes and teeth. If the eyes are
dull, do not make them seem more so, by
putting sparkling or brilliant rhinestones
near them. As to rings, many or none
should be^ worn. An exquisite hand re

. ThevValue of a Becoming Hat.
The value of a becoming hat cannot be
calculated. It is the article of attire more
than any other which brings out the good
points or accentuates the bad ones, not
only.'of eyes and hair, but of complexion
and the shape of the head. Let the hat
be suited to the wearer, and â¢ all else is
forgotten and forgiven. The picture hat
or the Gainsborough suggests beauty of
patrician type or the brilliancy of a Ru
bens beauty. It is suited rather to the
large-faced beauty than to a woman with
a small face who must not hide It under
a bushel. Â¦ She can better wear a close
clinging toque. The round-faced, plump
beauty may wear a ) hat turning back
from the face; one following too closely
the outline of the facesuggests'the fram
ing of the full moon. " .The woman with
a large, round and rather red face must
not crown it with, a small hat suitable
for some fairy. A thin face needs soft,
full framing to tone down all angles.
A woman with a retrousse nose should
not wear. a hat that is bent down directly
in the m'dcle. as it makes the nose look
as though it were trying to meet tha hat;
neither should" she wear a hat that goes

not think from this, however, that one
may choose indiscriminately all the tints

A red head should beware of pink and

IT is just as glorious to be a lovely
picture or a tine poem ars it is -to
paint the one or write the other.
The woman who harmoniously 'de-
velcps the best within her^ has the
charm of a beautiful poem, and if by
the grace and appropriateness of her
dress the enhances her natural endow
ments, she makes herself a pleasing pic
ture. However, before one f arrives at
this beatific consummation, 'which may
thape the fortune, the happiness- and the
v.hole destiny of life, one must study the
effects of contrast, harmonious and in
harmonious, of forms and colors. Color
is of prime importance in dress. That
every woman has in her complexion, eyes
and hair a distinct color scheme 7 is a
lact which artists have asserted for
years; it is also true that it requires no
little courage for a woman with U keen
love of artistic combinations to live up
to her color card. She must Sacrifice
many a bargain, shut her eyes- to hats
that are "dreams." and, in fact, exercise
as much self-denial as though she were
dieting to reduce her weight or to im
prove her complexion.
Periods of artistic dressing which have
occurred in history, at intervals, as the
Greek, the Empire and the Venetian, are
all practical illustrations of satisfactory
results to be obtained from color and tie
signs artistically considered.
There is such an endless variety in the
physical aspect of human beings that one
can hardly lay down any hard and fast
rule about the tints that may be placed
against certain complexions, and these
which are detrimental; the caprices of
nature must then be taken into account
and rules may be made somewhat elastic.
That blue, the pale blue, dedicated to
heaven and the babies, is a color for bru
nettes is a fact that is not generally
known. A brunette, whose rather high
coloring takes something from the refine
ment of her appearance, in a gown of
delicate shade of blue loses her hardness
of coloring and looks prettier, more deli
cate and refined. Green is another color
for the brunette; it is becoming to the
blonde as well, and it helps out with its
fresh, verdant tints the intermediate
stages of the human complexion. A
bright green brightens the natural bril
liancy of a clear, dark /complexion,
throwing into relief the red of the cheek
and lip and lending to the eye a clear,
sparkling light. A blonde requires a soft
er shade of green than the brunette. Too
bright a blue would "give to the fair
haired, fair-skinned woman a sallow,
washed-out look. But it is well to know
that'this color, as well as all others, can
be softened and rendered wearable by
either type of beauty if judiciously com
bined with white.
Although pale blue is generally cbnsiA
eied the color for blue eyes, it is a difli
uult color for a blonde, unless she have a
perfect complexion, and if there be a de
ject in the eye. blue alone must not be
worn, as it immediately calls attention
to the defective eye. Men are generally
accredited with having a preference for
blue. Does this convey a hint to the
wcrr.an. who can wear it, to don. a blue
gown, when she has a favor to ask of
father or husband?
Yellow is the blonde's own color. "I
have never worn yellow in my life. Mr.
Worth." said a flaxen-haired debutante.
rtmonstratingly, to the Parisian dress
maker, when he announced that he
should give her a yellow tulle gown.
"Ah! but you must wear yellow," said
the autocrat, "then you will be a blonde
sitting in sunshine." Shades of tan,
shading into cream, are also for the
blende, and warm browns that glow as
if they had golden hearts. Rose Is equal
ly incoming to blonde or brunette; the
shade known as shrimp being suited to
the dark-haired, Clytemnestra, while old
rose or even a fairer shade is for fair
haired Angelica. Heliotrope may be worn
by the blonde woman who has dark eyes,
and scarlet gives .tone to her skin and
bnghtreES to "her eyes. *.."Â¦â¢ â¢"
For the vast army oÂ£ girls, fair-haired
Lillians, blacked-eyed Augustas, who are "
neither blondes nor brunettes, but just
"mediums" or chatain, the following
hints- may be of benefit: ;
'. If hair Is dark and eyes blue," in'choos-
Ing a gown seek to match the eyes and
contrast the hair. One. rule in selecting
color Is to match the hair by day and the
eyes by night.. If the complexion is sal
low and the hair a nondescript brown,
shades of red and brown are good, no ',
matter what the color of the eyes, also
broad masses of one tint. â¢ â¢ Â¦
If the hair is black and complexion
swarthy, avoid black and all shades of
mauve, green and violet; yellow, scarlet
and pink are to be chosen.
If fair, with no trace of color, the com
plexion can be lightened by the a-idltioÂ«i
of rose or yellow, glowing purple, dark
blue and dark ,:green. She : of the rosy
cheeks selects gray, burnt orange^ pale
blue and a beautiful dusky tint of violet
shading to* blue, called Yeux Dagmar,
after the Princess Dagmar.
Blue eyes and dark brown hair, and
complexion that i? not clear, require col
crs much darker than the skin, or much
lighter, and, between the face" and the â¢
color some tint to soften the contrast.
Avoid delicate shades of pink, lavender
and all blues, except a deep. navy; black
makes the skin two shades darker and
duller. Instead of plain colors wear fancy
tints, mottled or clouded, mixed fabrics

brick building daily imagine that . the
regular course of English, Latin and
mathematics are all that the youngsters
try to get away from. But while they
may try to offer all kinds of excuses and
'â¢cut" all manner of recitations there
are several rooms that are too small for
the pupils and many hours that are too
short to exactly suit them.
have risen so rapidly and have
effected, or are destined to effect, the
course of education.
p-u jr AXUAL training in our public
f\/\ schools is getting off theoretical
I \i I grounds and is takicg a stand
I on experience's firm foundation.
JL Few educational movements
The next room is filled with would-be
artists. Here are the easels and nere are
the free-hand aspirants. They arrange
themselves anywhere they please and
draw from a model. If the school is too
poor to pay for one some one who ia
studying is frequently envefgled into pos
ing. Anything is resorted to to obtain a 1
live model. Not only black and white is
taught by any means. Historic ornaments
are studied and copied, frequently in
colors. Water-coloring and designing is
far more interesting to the I girls than
black and white. Sketches are valued for'
numerous reasons and the class is always
delighted to go on an outing where na
ture and her colors may be observed and T
explained. . Â¦ , ;
Besides this free-hand work there is
mechanical drawing. That means hard
The place is anything but inviting look
ing. The floor is white and everything
has a distinct rub-off appearance. Tlie
clay and tools are not prepossessing and
the models stand here and there without
the slightest interest in what is going on.
But the pupils are interesting. Intensely
so. Girls are covered completely with
large aprons; boys with jeans and jump
ers. They mold, pat, add to and take
away. There is no playing and no idling.
Every one is too absorbed In his own bit
of work to pay much attention to his
neighbors., |
Consequently the results are good.
Artists say surprisingly good. Teachers
say "pupils are always good here. Even
the worst boys in the school pay atten
tion to business j here, and have to be
driven out. The only trouble is that stu
dents have to be watched. Thev 'cut*
other recitations to stay here and .finish
their work."
Certainly that knowledge is usaWe.
Even people who are not philosopher*
agree as t*> thai: - While the main ide-i
has been elevated and extended and has.
moved somewhat away from utilitar an
considerations and has taken on more
educational aims, still the knowledge that
the road to a position is easier and
shorter remains firm.
The wood-turning shop is where the
pupil first faces a machine. He mast first
master its details and operations ; must
make it serve his ends. Tiie boys are all
crazy to make dumb-bells, Indian clubs,
stilts ar.d other articles that will serve
their own immediate purpose, while the
girls try their hands at card trays, vases,
shelves and anything that might prove
of some value about a house.
While one part of the room is entirely
devoted to carving, the other part of it
is in perpetual clay daubs. There are all
kinds of tables and stands covered with
chunks of v.et clay. Here the sirls par
ticularly fuss and fume every day and
test their artistic talents.
It seems queer to watch the students at
their studies. .They are so much apart
of It. Usually boys, or girls either, for
that matter, go at things in a haphazard
fashion, especially if the work is dirty.
Not so these people. They dress fur it
and are not afraid of using a little soap
and water afterward. The oil cans sim-
The girls don't have to take this
course, as blacksmithing would prove of
little use to them; but they can supple
ment Venetian iron work for it. They
turn out lamp and umbrella stands,
screens and fire sets and even crestir.gs.
Each piece of work is first drawn on pa
per, so they derive as much benefit from
It as do these boys.
Mr. BusnT the principal, says: "In nine
cases out of ten the boys make a dy
namo. They are permitted to make small
ones and are then taught their value. Sev
eral boys, that I know of have lighted
their homes with electric lights, and there
are all sorts of devices that have proved
a success. For instance, running the sew
ing machine by electricity."
They punch, weld and temper steel :
they make ' wrenches, washers, meat
hooks and even forks; later they turn
out tongs, chisels and a set'of lathe tools.
They work with machinery such as
water pumps for the building, even the
dynamo used in the chemistry depart
ment is the work of several chaps.
Scarcely a boy goes through that school
but ho takes a course in forging.
Any day they may be seen pumping their
bellows and hammering and pounding for
dear life. They burn themselves once in
a while, and they burn each other, but
they learn to handle implements and to
be careful. "A burned child dreads the
fire," and they take particular pains to
work all about it, to be over it and yet
not to be in it.
ing are^ as rigid and as exacting as a
problem in geometry; without it they are
\ merely-'- feu^ss-wofk." \ Â¦'' '
; . And besides educational value of it
- ;it is'a- potent/ 1 means of cultivating close'
1 attention, neatness, precision and order,
and these things all make up a great part
of life,* and if that was the only thing
that was gained the time could not be
counted lost.
When a boy first enters the shop he
puts on a suft> of overalls, and with his
change of clothes he changes his mind.
That Is, he leaves behind all frivolity and
takes up his work with a will. His first
lesson is to care for his tools and to learn
- the nature of each one. If he takes up
'foundry molding he, makes patterns of
?white metal and he makes his own mold.
In fact, all the work is turned out by the
pupils themselves. All the instruction" is
given that is actually required, but when
a thing is conquered by oneself it i3
much more valuable.
But because periods are given up to
these studies do not think for a moment
that none of the branches of high school
work aÂ»- taken up," because they are, and
what. is more, carried on until one is ad
mitted to any of the universities. There
is Latin, French and German, English,
geometry, algebra and trigonometry, civil
government and history and physics
plenty to keep one- busy.
Simply because manual training is
taken up the school is not a comfortable
one for idlers. "Work while you work
and play while you play" is their motto,
and it is strictly adhered to. The school
has nothing to offer in the line of "royal
roads" to learning. That is not its ob
ject and never will be. The aim is to
contribute to, the physical. Intellectual and
moral well-being of each and every stu
dent that enters its doors, which is ac
complished so well that San Francisco
should be proud of Its institution.
If a table is needed in any room tha
teacher goes down to the carpenter shop
and says, "I need a table four feet
square," and a few days later the table
is complete and ready for use. That
is the way they do things up there. And
one thing is true. If a chap can make
a table or a chest of drawers for tha
school he can make it again for home.
If you don't think the work is turned out
exactly a3 well as any finished carpen
ter can do it, go up and ask to see it.
You will find it everywnere In evidence,
and what Is more, you' may see It la
full progress.
Chemistry is another part of their
course that is interesting as well as in
structive. The experiments form the ba
sis for what theory it is necessary to
teach. Labor with the hands is mora
apt to hold the attention, and when it
is more or less dangerous, more of iest
is added. The laboratory is filled with
pupils, all intent on finding out things of
practical value, such as the analysis of
air, water, ice, gas, acids and a host of
other qualities quite as common but quite
as conolicated.'
' Another useful period is spent in the
carpentering shop. There are four Ion?
benches with drawers and drawers filled
with the necesary tools. first they
plane and saw; do just the ordinary,
homely things that everybody ought to
thoroughly understand and that so few
really do. Then they go really to work.
They make chests, drawers, tables, book
cases and the like.
ply reek and the machinery is greasy and
black, but they handle it and come out
of the fray as black as the ace of spades.
The girls roll up their sleeves and sail
in. If they had to tlo that selfsame
thing at home their dignity would be
everlastingly wounded, but at school 1* is
different. The spirit of rivalry is strong
and each and every one has to do his or
her best or be Iett most awfully in the
lurch.

the many fine situations in "The Battle-
Grcund." It has been chosen for two rea
sons; first because it is complete in itself;
and second, because it brings out so ade
quately the sentiments of the Northern
and Southern soldiers:
On the afternoon of the third day, as the
little company drew near to the Appomattox
Courthouse, it founftâ the road blocked with
abandoned guns and lined by exhausted travel
ers, who had prone down at the last halting
place. As It filed into an open field beyond a
wooded level, where a few campflres glimmer
ed, a group of Federal horsemen clattered'
across the front, and. as if by instinct, the
column formed into battle line, and the hand
of every man was on the trigger of his musket.
"Don't fire, you fools!" called an officer from
behind them, in a voice sharp with irritation.
"The army has surrendered!"
"What! Grant surrendered?" thundered the
line, with muskets at a trail as it rushed into
the open.
"No, you blasted fools; we've surrendered."
ehouted the voice, rising hoarsely In a gasping
indignation.
"Surrendered, the deuce!" scoffed the men,
as they fell back into ranks. "I'd like to
know what General Lee will think of your
surrender. . . *
A little colonel, with his hand at his sword
hilt, strutted up and down before a tangle of
dead thistles.
"I don't know what he thinks of It, he did
it," he shrieked, without pausing in his walk.
"IV e a. damn He!" cried Dan, in a white
heat. Then he threw his musket on the ground
and fell to sobbing the dry. tearless sobs of a
man who feels In his heart crushed by a eud
den blow.
There were tears on all the faces around him,
and Pinetop was digging his great- fists Into
hie eyes as a child does who has been pun
ished before his playmates. Beside him a man
with an untrlmmed, ehaggy beard hid his dis
torted features in shaking hands.
"I ain't blubberin' fur myself," he said,
defiantly, "but O Lord, boys â I'm cryin' fur
Marse Robert."
Over the field the beaten soldiers, in ragged
gray uniforms, were lying beneath little bushes
of sassafras and sumach, and to the right a
few campfires were burning In a ehady thicket.
The struggles was over. ,and each man had
f alien where he stood, hopeless for the fir.it
time in four Ions years. Up and down the
road groups of Federal horsemen trotted with
cheerful unconcern, and now and then a pri
vate paused to make a -remark In friendly
tones: but the men beneath' the bushes only
stared with hollow / eyes In answer â the blank
stare of the defeated who have put their whole
strength into the fight.
Taklns out his Jackknife. Dan unfastened
the flag; from thÂ«; hickory pole on which he had
placed it, and began cuttintr it into little pieces,
which he paessd to each man who had fought
beneath Its folds. The last bit he put into his
own pocket, and trembling like one gone sud
denly palsied, passed frcm the midst of hia
silent comrades to. a pine ctump on the border
of the woods. Here he Â¦ sat down and looked
hopelessly upon the scene before him â upon the
Uttered roads and the great blue lines encir
cling the horizon. . â¢
Down the road a line of Federal privates
came driving- an ox before them, and he eyed
them gravely, wondering in a dazed way if
the t8Ete of victory had gone to their heads.
Then he turned slowly, for a voice was speak
ing at his side, and a tall man in a long blue
coat was building a little fire bard by.

shortly.

a quart pot full of water on the coals and

Bright Days in Merrie England.
A very attractive and useful volume Is
one that has been recently published by
Honeyman &.Co. of Plainfleld, N. J. The
full title of the book. is "Bright Days in
Merrie Englandâ Four-In- Hand Jour
neys," written by A. V. D. Honeyman.
The mechanical excellency of the work is
of a very high gradeâ the typography,
binding and numerous illustrations being
of the best.
Those who have traveled in England,
or expect to take a trip, will be equally
interested; for to take thi3 trip with Mr.
Honeyman is almost as good as going
yourself. He is a keen observer and also
has to a marked degree that happy fac
ulty of description that makes other eye3
see what his eyes have seen. It has been
Mr. Honeyman's fad for a number of
years to spend a part of his summers in
England and indulge In the delightful
pastime of coachingâ probably the best
way in the world of seeing and enjoying
the scenery and observing the points of
interest. The book is of nearly 500 pages
and ls fully indexed. The author gives
his experiences . in charming narration,
far from the usual guidebook st-^le that
one is so apt to indulge in, and covers
about 800 mllea of the bestÂ» country of
Englandâ the English lake district and
Middle, Southern and Western England.
His trips have been so planned to take In
every bit that might prove most inter
esting to the sightseer. The Illustrations
are different from those generally found
in books of this kind, for most of them
are frt>m photographs taken by Mr. Hon

Caesar's Commentaries.
The American Bpok Company of New
York has recently Issued "JHarkness and
' Forbes' Caesar's Commentaries on the
War," with introduction,, notes and
vocabulary by Albert Harkness, Ph. D.,
LL. D., professor emeritus in Brown
University, assisted by Charles H.
Forbes, A. B., professor of Latin in Phil
lips Academy, Andover, Mass.
This work is pre-eminently a student's
edition, and has been prepared with spe
cial reference to the present needs of pre
paratory and secondary schools. The edi
tors have had exceptional opportunities
for studying and appreciating the need3
of such schools. They combine a. thor
ough acquaintance with the best methods
of classical instruction at home and ,
abroad with a practical experience in
teaching Latin.
This edition is furnished with an intro
duction containing an outline of the life
of Caesar, a description in brief of the
scenes of his military operations in Gaul.
Germany and Britain, and a short treat
ise on the military system of the Ro
mans. . - Â¦
In the notes to the earlier books ques
tions are interspersed at intervals to aid
the student in adding to his stock of
knowledge in a definite and positive form,
such grammatical and historical infor
mation as. the author places within his
reach. ' In these questions the historical
aspect of the study is especially empha
sized.
In the vocabulary special attention i3
given to etymology, but the treatment !s
made as simple as possible with the aim
of aiding the student in understanding
and appreciating the significant elements
of words. The important subject of
idioms and phrases receives due atten
tion. )
Among the most striking features of the
work are the nine colored plates illustra
tive of the military system of the Ro
mans, which have been reproduced in
the natural colors. Besides these there
are many other illustrations, eleven plans
of battles, seven campaign maps, and a
general map of Gaul. Price Jl 25.
WHEN last year we received
from the pen of Miss Ellen
Glasgow her novel. "The Voice/
of the People." a story of con
- temporary Southern life, it was
an easy matter to prophesy for the
author a brilliant literary career. This
season her book, "The Battle-G round,"
more than fulfills our expectations. Al
though "The Voice of the People" was
one of the best books of the year, this
last splendid story of life in the South
before and during the Civil War is even
better. It Is written with more mature
power, with better literary finish, and to
the reviewers mind is a better production
than "The Crisis" or "Audrey."
One point in which this work shows the
highest literary cleverness is in the total
absence of any "gallery play" that is so
frequently employed by writers to excit<Â»
interest where the author is lacking ih
the divine talent that can hold the read

ir.n instead of literary fireworks.
ilits Glasgow sives us a novel without
a villain. She tells a love story, the ul
timate ending of which is evident from
the first few pages; and yet you read
with unflagging: interest every page from
beginning to end with the same zest and
with only a regret that you must at last
j'art company with people so delightfulâ
that is art:

before the war are inimitable. Her bat

power of the "book, as has been fc.im.ed,
lies not eo much in incident or climax as
in the remarkable development of char

each and every detail bear directly tpoii
the purpose of the whole.

Miss Glasgow writes without partlsaii-
Bfclp and you find the right strongly con
trasted with the wrong. Another point
in the authors literary ability is shown
here in the accomplishment of her ends
without falling into that bore often in
flicted upon the patient novel reader, the
hore of sermonizing.
The story follows the life and fortunes
of Dan Mont joy, but by no means to the,
exclusion of other people just as deserv
ing of study. His fiancee, Betty Ambler,
is one of the most lovable characters of
ficlion. and it would be difficult to Imag
ine iÂ«-(i more delightful characters of the
old school of Southern gentlemen than
ilajor Lightfoot and Goverribr Ambler.
Di>n is a. splendid specimen of the youn;r
Southerner of the cavalier type. We meet
him first as a little waif tramping
through the night to his grandfathers
plantationâ the plantation of Major
Li^htfoot. Dan's mother was the ma-
Jor'e only daughter, who had married
against his will and had been disowned.
After her death, her son goes to throw
himself upon the mercy of the stern and
unforgiving father. With characteristic
Southern hospitality the major receives
the little boy with open arms, and Dan is
soon installed as chief favorite, with -.11
the opportunities of becoming a spoiled
chad and a worthless spendthrift that
would be afforded by the rash leniency
of a doting- and rich grandparent.
The Lightfoot blood saves Dan in the
erd, but several times in the course of
his history he is at the turning point
where a fatal step would mean ruin.
In his college days he fights an unsav
ory duel with a brother Virginian and re
turns to his grandfather's house, where
the news of his slip from grace has al
ready preceded him. With two such fiery
tempers as the major's and Dan's
brought in contact the inevitable happens
and Dan leaves the house in a rage and
in disgrace to make his own way in th<
world. It is at this time that he realizes
the true love and devotion of Betty Am
bler, and he goes forth into a life so for
eign to him, buoyed up with the strength
of a good woman's love.
He is soon joined by his devoted body
servant. Big Abel, who runs away from
the major to be with his young master
and together they go to make their way
Jn the world. The outbreak of the war
finds Dan and Big Abel enlisted in a com
pany of volunteers waiting impatiently
to eo to the front.
The picture that Miss Glasgow draws of
the hot-headed youngsters of the volun
teer regiments at this time is splendidly
done. They little realize the troubles
ahead, and to their minds the possibili
ties of the war are merely one grand lark.
They scorn the discipline, and, of course
ail expect to be colonels and generals in
a few weeks. Dan has Big Abel do all
his camp chores for him and Is still the
young Southern gentleman, as yet un
sobered by the acts of hard fate. The
campaign soon changes all this, and Miss
Glasgow brings her hero through a
school of stern practice severe enough
to make or break any man. But Dan has
the right etock in him, and though he
?Â° m^5,? u $. of the war a Private as he went
to, still the reader will find no fault with
the author for not crowning him with
temporal honors where she does so much
for him by giving him the hand and heart
of Betty Ambler, after first having made
nlm worthy of her.

â¢rtcrnres at resu ringers hung around thÂ»

declined to desecrate the art, but I ask-d
Manager Leahy what he considered the
first essential to success on the stage.
â¢ "Here you have got to make good on a
voice. For success In capital letters yoi
should have three thingsâ a good figure, a
pretty face and a good voice. Here we
consider the voice first of all, but In som?
of the Eastern cities a pretty face goes a
long way. Here, besides all these, you
ought to know something about dancing
and carrying yourself properly. Did you
ever stop to think that it Is not an easy
thing to walk across the stage properly?"
"But how do girls ever get on the stage
at all when they are so persistently dis
couraged by everybody?" I asked.
"Well, there are two now," answered
Mr. Leahy, motioning in the direction
v where two young ladles were waiting to
speak to him. "They have sung for Stein
dorff. and he says they'll do, and now
they are waiting for a chance in the
chorus."
"And I hope they'll get it," said I as I
fled and left the way clear for the two '
that Steindorff had O. K.'d.
Next I headed for the Central, and here *
again I was met by Belasco.
"Didn't Bryant encourage â¢ you?" said
he. and I thought I saw a twinkle in his
eye. x
"No," I said, "he didn't. But I have
been in amateur theatricals with great
success, and when I go to the matinees
and sit in the front rows and watch the
leading lady it just makes me crazy to
act."

ISABEL, FRASER.
LAST week T assumed tlie role of a
stage-struck girl arid applied at the
different theaters for a position. I
tried to persuade each and . every
manager that I was just what the
Ions suffering public was waiting forâ
the missing star in the theatrical heav
ens.
IV f a long cry from the footlights to
Â¦fame, and a dreary road beset with dis
tourigements that even leads up to the
footlights-: but with the persistency of the
EUige-struck I insisted to the mana
gers that cculd I but get my foot on the
first rung of the ladder success would be
att-ured.
I had i ead many warnings to such as I.
and I wanted to see if in reality it was
as hard as purported for a girl to get a
start on the stage.
I learned that managers dealt in cold,
brutal truth, which they hand to you on
the slightest provocation. They delight
in disillusioning those lured by the fatal
fascination of the footlights.
I first went to the Alcazar and told my
troubles to the young man at the box win
dow.
"I want to go on the stage; whom shall
I Eee?" ";- \
Fred Belasco materialized from the
eh&dowy depths of the box office.
"You want to go on the stage, do you?"
he said, with a look of pitying inquiry.
"Yes, I should like to go on very much.
Tve always felt that I had talent that
way and my friends all say "
"Go and talk to Bryant," he said, with
an I-have-troublea-of-my-own wave of
the hand. *, "Â»
"Who ie Bryant?" I asked the little boy
â¢who sells candy at the door, for I saw
that further information from the box of
fice was not courted.
"Mr. Bryant? He's the stage manager. V
"Want to see him? Go right down there."
He pointed to a stairway which led down
under the theater and I picked my way
along a narrow passage that was walled
on each side by stage properties- -here
was a king's gilded throne and there an
emblazoned chandelier, a bathtub on end"^
Â«md a conservatory of paper palms.
"Mr. Bryant, stage manager," read a
littlt black sign.
"Come in," called a cheery voice in an-
Bwer to my knock. The voice seemed
something tangible and encouraging in
that sepulchral place.
Hf smiled indulgently when I told him
what I wanted.
"Do you suppose there is any chance for
my going on?" I asked.
"Well. Kuppose you did go on. do you
know how much you would get at first?"
"Not more than $5 per week and furnish
>our <>wn wardrobe. You might haver a
vpfk's engagement. You might, if you
had luck, liave a run of- a month and then
nave nothing for months. Now. if you
hav? money you can wait your chance,
but vithout money don't do it. Put the
srrn* amount of energy into some other
liu<- cf worh and it will repay you fourfold
ni'-re than the stage.
"It takes a girl with the constitution of
a l:nrs-Â»> to stand the workâ long hours, re
hearKiils. the rcFponsibii'ity of costuming.
Lrfvrning your lines alone, is no email

ducr a play Â« week.
"Well, take enc? day â take ye*terday, for

till r on that. Monday night's perform
ance showed this week's play needed to
be ehpngeril in rpots. I called a rehearsal
on the Jhir<1 art and we went over one
little piece of business fifteen time*. If.
w;<s 5 o'clock whvn we left the theater.
After that, perbays you would have to go
to the dressmaker's, take u hasty bite
and hurry back to make up for the even
ing performance.
"After the theater, when you are all
tired out. tho manager may hand yo.u an
other pan an<I you go home, not to rest
but to study for two or three hour*."
"Do you discourage all girls from going
on the stace?" VkskeC.
** A. 1
Always/- promptly answered the man
ager. "That is. if -you call it discouraging
a girl to show her just what she will have
to get used to. About one out of every
five takes the advice.
"A girl the other day from a comfort
able home came to see me about going on
the stage. She hadn't any idea what it
meant. She had always had what she
wanted at home and had been used to
considerate treatment from others.
"On the stageâ well, tt might be differ
ent." Mr. Bryant evidently did not walit
to commit himself on the point of stage
eticiuette. "Besides shÂ« was a girl of deli
cate constitution. She couldn't stand the
strain of the work. Take, for instance,
a week of day's such as yesterday. Some
days are not so hard, but they are pretty
much the sameâ all crowded with work. A
week of it would kill that girl."
"But," 1 protested, "suppose a girl is
ambitious and does get a start and shows
herself in earnest and works hardâ what
then?"
"Well," said Mr. Bryant, half closing his
eyes as though tracing mentally the his
tory of such a one. "She gets a smaU
part, perhaps that of a servant girl or
maidâ an unobtrusive part and an unob
_trusive part if acted well passes unno
ticed. A valet, butler or maid who does
his part well is merely part of the picture
âa necessary part, but merely a detail.
"Take the girl whose one ambition !s to
some day be a great actress. She is deter
mined to succeed at any hazard. All her
life she has looked forward to the dtage
as a career. Her intense desire to succeed
makes her in dead earnest about work.
Success spells hard work and patience. It
takes her years, perhaps, to come in/bow
and say: \
" 'My lord, the carriage waits.'
"At last she gets a part. Perhaps be
cause she has become a fixture around the
theater and the stage manager decides to
try her.
"Sometimes success spells accident.
Some one is sickâ the girl who has been
j waiting- for a chance is given part.
She takes her cue. The moment of her life
has come. Her voice falters at first. Then
the applause she has, been listening for
for years greets her. Her dreams are
made flesh. Her voice grows stronger.
She /'and the audience are in sympathy.
She is dimly conscious of that black mass
' on the other side of the footlightsâ the
great listening eager public, but they are
with her. She has that consciousness that
is deeper and better , than successâ the
knowledge that she has deserved it. She
has served a long and bitter apprentice
ship and at last she has arrived.
"But where you find one girl of
this stamp you find twenty who are im
patient and who grudge every moment of
apprenticeship. .Some take it as a per-
"We're not trying any new talent," said
Mr. Morrisey, "unless they are cracka
jacks." And he gave me a look which
said plainly that he did not consider me
"a crackajack."
"What can you doâ have you had any
experience ?" he ask ad.
"Noâ no," I hastened to reassure him,
fearful that he might ask me to get up
and do a turn. A mite of a girl was
singing and trilling: to the great empty '
house.
"Has she ever been on the stage?" I
asked.
"No, but there was a pull brought to
bear in her case. An old friend of mine
came to me and said: 'John, I have a
friend who wants to go on. I wish you'd
look her over and see what you" think of
her.'"
"What are you going to tell heÂ»?**
"I am going to ask her if she has a
home here, and - if she has I'll tell he
to go home and be a comfort to the old
folks. That girl isn't fit for thÂ© stage.
Imagine her knocking around the country
doing one-night stands! She'd probafly
tit down and cry if her trunk didn't ar
rive on time. She'd better go back to the
old folks. I'll not let her run away with
the Idea that she has any talent." *
So I left it to John Morrisey to shatter
the little girl's air castles while I slipped
out of the door and headed for the Tiv
oli. *
My little speechâ "I want to go on the
stage"â had by this time become auto
matic, and a disapproving look in answer
I expected as part of tho programme.
Imagine my surprise then when Man
ager Leahy took it all as a joke!
"You want to go on the stage, do you?
Poor gtrlt What do you singâ soprano or
contralto?"- .
Sing! I had never sun? a note In my
life, but now I remembered that they did
sing In the Tlvoli chorus, but I had al
ways thought "limbs" were the long suit.
Neck and arms I knew counted nothing:,
for my mental stage pictures Included
many a bony neck and scrawny arm.
"Say, you, come around to-morrow at
10 and sing for Director Steindorff, and
then as you go out you'll hear him tell
me how rotten it was!"
far he can Jump,' and you can't tell by the
looks of a girl just what she can do/ Those
who appear at first glance to be most
promising often become frightened at the
'Â¦ work and drop out of the ranks. The most
Insignificant looking have often surprised
both : the public and themselves.
,"A ; good/ education - is one of the first
essentials.' Brains are necessary to gauge
the emotions and to interpret parts. Me
chanical training Is not all nor does it
follow .; that be'cause one can take well
parts | taught him he ..will [ have brains
enough to, create character; for that's
tv hat Interpretation of a part means. A
great actor sets his individual stamp on
the character he interprets and makes
the personality of the character stand out.
! 'To be a well-rounded actress requires
a capacity ior infinite painstaking. That'*!
what it all amounts to. That's what j a
manager is continually hammering at in
one way or another. Acting is a profes
sion. It should have the same prepara
tion and constant Â» keeping up with the
times that is given to any other profes
sion. One intelligent in the art of acting
should be conversant with the history of
the . stage. It is an interesting historyâ
the evolution of. the stage; and one whose
life's work is on the stage should cer
tainly be interested to the extent of
knowing it.
"If you leave your name and address,"
said' Mr. Bryant, opening a large book
and turning over pages and pages of
names and addresses, "I'll send for you
â¢when your turn comes." And I placed my
name and address at the end of the list
of the "also rans," thanked Mr. Bryant
for his advice, which I told him was no
doubt good, and retraced. my steps under
the palms past the tub and throna and
up into the light of day.
The ordinary" stage-struck girl would
think twice, I pondered, after that excel
lent talk. Nevertheless I crossed the
street to the, Orpheum.
"I want to go on. the stage," I confided
to the man in the box window, this time
rather timidly, for I half expected a
scolding for presuming on such an am
bition.
"Come around Tuesday morningâ that's
when they try out the new ones."

EXPERIENCES OF A "STAGE -STRUCK" GIRLgACCARAT is a game little known
in the United States, but in Europe
it is the chief diversion of those
who -tempt Dame Fortune's fickle
smile. Wherever on the Continent
gambling is indulged in baccarat will be
found to be the most popular game. Fab
ulous sums are won and lost at the tables,
and many a. tragedy is enacted in the
gambling rooms when men have staked
and lost their all and disgrace confront
ing them. Princes j and plebeians, kings
and peasants, have at times risked their
possessions at the tables. few have
won and have had the good Judgment -to
forsake the gambling habit forever: the
vast majority of the players have lost and
ruined palaces and castles, and indigent
noblemen and bankrupt financiers tell the
lesson.
It Is only a few weeks ago that the
foreign newspapers contained accounts of
the immense losses sustained by Count
Joseph Potocki, a Russian nobleman, at a
baccarat game in Vienna. In four hours*
play he is said to have lost 5800,000, a sum
that makes all previous individual losses
appear insignificant. The Imperial Chan
cellor'Goluchowski, who stood .by Po
tocki's side and saw the money lost, has
been severely reprimanded by the Em
peror.
- : Opposed to Count Potocki in the colossal
game were . the Hungarian Deputy, Herr
von Szemere, and Prince Francis Bragan
za. Von Szemere won* $500,000 from Po
tocki and Prince, Braganza $250,000. The
remaining $50,000 can probably be account
ed for by the outstanding players and the
percentage of the table..
Taking cognizance of these facts the au
thorities have instituted proceedings
against Potocki and the principal win
ners. They have been notified that they
are not to leave Vtenna without especial
permission.
Europe has been ringing with scandal
ever since Potocki's losses came to public
knowledge. Nothing like it has ever been
.known, even In Austria, where gambling
for high stakes is common. Count Potocki
is very wealthy, but is in the condition
that is sometimes termed * "land poor."
His estate consists of land which at
this particular time Is difficult to sell.
In consequence of this the young Russian
Count has contracted enormous debts
which he has engaged to pay off in in
stallments. On two occasions within the
last fortnight Potocki lost heavily. .
He apparently came Into the Jockey
Club on the evening In question with the
deliberate Intention of retrieving â¢ ills
losses with a grand coup. Von Szemere
not being a wealthy man, the stakes at
first were moderate. Both the Hungarian
Deputy and Prince Braganza won steadily
from the outset. Then the unfortunate
and reckless Count forced the high play
and- plunged desperately. His opponents,
having won so heavily, could not refuse
his demands to increase the stakes.
They rolled up by thousands and tens of
thousands. Potocki was apparently mad.
I turn to listen and look. A son of Erin,
short in stature and ruddy in nose, pre
senting a check, pantsâ
. "Oi want me bundle."
I "There is two-bits storage."
"Two-Dits is it? An' whaur do ye think
Oi'll be afther gettin' two-bits? Such
nautorlous thaves as ye railroaders be
thinks a respictlble man loike meself is
made o* money. It's.more'n the bundle
is wort." But he paid it all the same,
making room for a gentleman who point
ed out threo large trunks.
"There will.be twenty-five dollars ex
cess."
Game That Wfi-is ar\d Lo^S Thousands
Crowds of noblemen gathered about the
table looking at the tremendous play in
astonishment. They were horrified at
Potocki's losses.*
During: the game an elderly member of
the. Jockey Club entered the card room,
and hearing what was going on took thÂ»
framed notice prohibiting gambling from
the wall and placed it on the table be
fore the Russian plunger. I
Potocki, now intensely, excited, sprans â¢
to his feet, seized the framed notice and '
threw it into the fire. -He then called for
several bottles of imperial Tokay at $100
a bottle and began, to drink deeply.
When Potocki had lost $300,000 and the
excitement was at its height Count Henry
Hoyos endeavored to induce Potocki to
leave the table. The Count was rebuffed
and immediately left the room.
The game was conducted in a regular Â«
fashion and has not been' questioned.
Since the game the Jockey Club has been
closed.
Although Count Potocki now holds the
record as the heaviest player at baccarat .
in all Europe, there have been others
who have risked large sums at the game.
In his early days King Edward of Eng- .
land lost heavily and much scandal was
caused ; by some of his gambling esca
pades.
It is a well known fact that more money
is made cheating: at baccarat, than can
be won honestly. In this . there is, of
course, .â¢no: imputation that -the; Count
Potocki did not lose his money fairly. In,
the late '80s Lambri Pasha, made 1.000,000
francs cheating at baccarat. George Rus
sell, cousin of the Duke of Bedford and
son-in-law of the Duke of Roxburghe, at
tained an unpleasant notoriety on ac
count of his gambling exploits.
Walter Harbord, a brother of Lord
Dufferin, was accused of cheating- at bac
carat at Nice. The Marquis of Huntly.
captain of the Queen's bodyguard of gen
tlemen, ran away to Albania to avoid the
police In connection with a gambling ex
perience. Lord de Ros, the first Baron
of England, was also involved In a great
gambling disgrace. !?."Â¦:
In fair and square gambling, however,
the scandal seems to He . only with the.
losers.' In this fact the Czar appears to
recognize Count Potocki's disgrace. Ho N
has shown his disapproval by recalling
him to Russia.
The Earl of Aylesford. an intimate
friend of the Prince of Wales, was ruined
by his gambling propensities. He would
not leave a gamins table while he had a
shilling in his pocket so long as the game
was going-. On one occasion he sat for
thirty-six hours at a stretch, playing bao
carat. This fact was duplicated by the
Duke of York, the granduncle of King
Edward.
The Duchess of Devonshire is an In
veterate gambler and one of the most
reckless plungers at Monte Carlo. Night
after night during the season she may
be seen at the tables watching thÂ« taru
of the cards with feverish eyes.
"That's my trunkâ no, it Isn't either,
but mine is just like it," began a smooth
faced youth. I laughed, it was too funny;
"Well, since they , have begun all over
again I think I'll take that boat."

That seemed a gooa time to protest, but
the traveler paid the trifle cheerfully, and
to confirm the fact that he bore no ill-will
proffered his cigar case, and remarked he
thought it would, be more; that his wife
had a mania for collecting bric-a-brac
which could probably be bought at home
for a third of what it would cost to get it
there, but it gave her pleasure and
amused him.

with what wind remained to him. His

his vernacular with a vigor that left lit

glared himself away to deposit his little

â¢'I want my trunk." throwing down a
check.
That's how I came to spend a morning
in the baggage-room. Trunks, valises,
baskets and bundles! Bundles, baskets,
valises and trunks! The din of trucks
coming and going, the continuous thump,
thump, of luggage loading and unloading,
the clink of checks taken from or re
turned to the great reels, the chink of
money for excess, the hubbub of voices,
travelers and clerks, all talking at once,
the sing-song of numbers thrown like a
shuttlecock from "floor" to office and
back again presented so much to unaccus
tomed eyes and ears that it was some
time before I could really apply myself
to the thing for which I came.
"Well, what do you make of it? Isn't it
as I said? There, for instance, take that
lady, there on the right. She's the genu
ine article, and you would be surprised to
find how few there are like her. She will
not abuse us when asked to pay excess
like that handsomely dressed woman be
hind her. Listen to what she says and
see if I am not right."
"Only two dollars? I thought it would
be more â the trunk is so large, but one
hates to travel with a half empty one,"
and. smiling, she moved away.
"Didn't I tell you? Now, see the differ
ence between her and that one."
"A dollar and a half for extra baggage!
It's a perfect outrage. I have traveled all
the way from New York with my trunk
not a bit heavier than it is now and never
was asked for a cent. Why don't you
charge fcr every pound of weight? You
might Just as well and you would make
more. It is .simply scandalous and I shall
report it to the company."

are rot a bit backward about embracing

so often as in the baggage-room. "Why?*
Well, I don't know, I'm sure, but you

band bonnets are to be the style. They
have a little ruffle around the face and
the back is baggy for the hair to fit in.
The feature is the elaborately heavy
. stitching which holds the bonnet very

To make the figure slender they are
fitting wide ribbons to a' stiff band. Tha
band is hooked around the waist and the
ribbons hang down. Just above the knees
they are attached to a flounce, which acts
as a petticoat. Thus one wears a skirt
that is only a skeleton above the knee.
Such a waist is no more than a corset
cover in matter of thickness, and is so
very comfortable when it comes to the
convenience of being able to slip off one's
waist or coat.
look given by this little trick of f oldln*
the plaits.
All the cloth gowns, it is safa to say
every one of them, are made so that a
shirt waist can be worn beneath. Many
of them really demand a shirt waist, for
the neck of the dress shows, and the*
vest.
There come little false vestÂ» to bÂ»
slipped in and necks that are Ilka berthas.
But, after all, it is' better to have a shirt
waist beneath the little cloth coat so that
the latter can be slipped off.
' This is the almost universal custom and
the woman who is getting a cloth suit
better have it fitted over a taffeta shirt
waist which may be ever so plain, yet can
have a pretty lace stock and a little strip
of ribbon for a belt. ; 'Vj
- The part â¢ which ' black muslin is to play
in the summer's - wardrobe : can be only
surmised. ' Every modiste " Is * making a
black | muslin gown | and .there J are ' numer
ous gowns of this material -for sale.
The j brim Is -trimmed with black lace,
falling like a- curtain over the face/- and
at the back there are curtain tabs. Black
lace is pretty, but .so is; white; -and 'one

The other hat is a dressier one", and is a
large boat-shaped hat of satin straw. .The
sides turn up. a very little and the hat is
large. Its crown Is very simply trimmed
with a bunch of roses at one side. One
side of the hat is lifted a trifle' to show a
few pink roses nestling next the hair. , ;
This hat. which is to be all black and
very serviceable. Is made entirely of
horsehair, to give its plain name, and will
bear all kinds of wear without tearing. It
positively is not injured by the weather.
A little waterproof mallne- Is twisted
around the 1 brim and the top is in several
varieties of , horsehair treated so -that
it is very smart. Some of the finest Of the
Fifth-avenue hats are or thl* material.
These hats are delightful ana there aro

WltJi such a gown two hats are recom
mendable. One should be a' black.' wheel
s-hapw] hat. raised at the side. Under the
raiFed portion there can be a black bird's
wing or two wings, both pointing back.
Two Hats for Each Gown.
The waist is a blouse, open all the way
down the front, to show the' underwaist.
There are straps across it at the bust line,
and half way between the bust and belt.
Thc^e are oÂ£ homespun bands, : bound
with black silk. , -
Suppose one owns a gown of that popu
lar material,, homespun, of light weight.'
And suppose it be in that latest furor of
color, brick red. A gown of this kind is
tastefully trimmed with " black taffeta
bands and with black trimmings in the
form of very narrow passementerie,* and
very narrow black lace, no wider than'
baby ribbon. " The skirt Is made in the pre
vailing mode for homespun, ; plain, with
the foot flare.' Â» -'".': i^'i ' -.-Â¦Â¦.
As a matter of fact, those who dress
with good taste and plenty of money are
buying two waists with every nice street
suit, and two hats. Whether one lias two
waists or not. one should have two hats.
The walch fob of ribbon, to match the
gown, with gold trimmings, is very nec
essary and the long neck chain, which is
worn more than ever.
The little wrist bags are so necessary
these days, made of beads, with the re
verse side in silk. The under side should
not be beaded, because of the fact that
beads tear, the skirt aVid wear it out in"
spots. Â¦ ' â¢
Oh. the dress isn't all! One must have
the little fixings, and the big belongings;
and with every nice suit there are enough
small things to equal the cost of the suit.
The matter of a black silk petticoat is
something, even though she be a woman
who buttons a silk flounce on a mus'ifi
yoke: and she must have a tight- roll tan
colored silk umbrella with a gold handle
âto go- with her bisque suit.
But, doing without gloves and boa and
making her old hat go, she must still
consider her. shoes. Colonial ties are in,
and the dull finish leather shoes and the
kids without gloss. Then, too, the low
patent leathers. . with buckles on the in
step, and the shoes with the new high
heels that are easy to walk "in becausa
so squareâ all are in. And the shell-pat
terned stockings in shades to match the
gown.
The New Small Things.
It is no use to 'advise a woman with
exactly J1C0 to- go out and spend it on a
bisque colored cloth gown. For. how.wiU
she buy, her . stitched-toack gloves, and
where will her tailor-made, boat-shaped
hat come in, and where is she to get the
fluffy boa, all of satin ribbon loops, which
she is to throw around her neck?
Yet it is a fact, an undeniable fact, that
there live a' great many very ' estimable
women who do not feel as though they
could afford to pay 5100 for a single suit.
There are even .women who have to dress
the entire, spring on $100._and. part of thÂ«j
summer. ' ' * ' . . â¢ ' Â¦â¢â¢ . Â¦ -
well worth the money also. They can be
worn indefinitely, for they are of such
high grade goods that they do not shrink
nor lose color, and they will keep the!r
style well. . You can wear them spring
and fall for. several seasons,; or until you
can afford to get another $100 suit.
Xow, the woman or much Ingenuity and
small means will tee that bisque cloth
with a nice finish, made up in an Eton
suit, with the Eton low in the neck, cut
rounding front and back, and worn over
a peach-colored taffeta shirt waist, would
look very much like this suit, and every
whit as neat, without probably costing
anything like as much.
The question of how much to pay for, a
tailored suit at this time of year is more
than interesting to the' i woman with lit
tle money to epcnd. The White House
agitation about dressing: on $300 1 a year
called attention to the fact that $50 was
not considered an exorbitant Sum to pay
for a tailor-made dress.
And It Is not. In the light of the cost
of the material and the' amount of work
which is put on the new tailored suits,
$50 is cheap, and the woman with $50 to
spare for a cloth suit should not hesitate
about expending: it in this manner.
The tailored cults that sell for $100 are

Mrs- Jack Astor in Bisque.
Mrs. "Jack" Astor has a new cloth
gown in bisque color. This is. a shade
made familiar under several names. It Js
called mode color. It is also known as
one of the shades of tan. Again it is
imitated in a faint peach tint, but after
all there is a delicacy in the true bisque
that cannot be found in the other colors
that are bo much like it. ,
Bisque suede gloves, by the way, are
worn for evening with black gowns, and
also with white one â a new fadâ and very
nice they look. They are quite taking thu
place of white and lemon color and are
rivaling, if not surpassing, pearl. They
are very delicate and suggest, ever so lit
tle, a Sight chamois color. The idea cf
wearing bisque and flesh colored gleves
with a v.hite dress is fust becoming very
popular.
Mrs. Astor's gotvn is in trotting cloth.
That is an English term for material
used in walking dre.-ses. It is & fine soft
cloth, very adaptable to street wear. â¢
This bisque cloth has a fitted skirt of
many gores, made with a very full sweep
end with the'volante. or flounce. The
bodice is an Eton bodice with a shirt
waist of peach colored silk. Thy clotn
Eton is low in the neck and hooks. ip the
front under peach colored choux. The
Kton is one of the short waisted kind,
curved high in the back, with the eqtire
lower euge trimmed with a curtain of
white lace.
The sleeves are large ones, with the
cloth heavily draped around the wrists,
which are finished with a curtain of lace.
The skirt above the fitted flounce^r
must it be called a volanteâ is ' trimmed
with white iace put on perfectly plain,
and bordered top and bottom with a.
heavy gold gimp.
.It Is the color that counts and the
style that tells. It does not so much pe
pend upon the goods or the color, as upon
the treatment.
Miss Randolph, the debutante daughter
of William C. Whitney, has a town cos
tume in plnn. cloth trimmed with lozenges
of Havana brown velvet, each one over
laid with Brussels lace. The skirt has a
fitted or graduated flounce, to give it the
English name, instead of the fancy
French one, and there is a littfe bolero
of Brussels lace which fits very tightlyâ
in fact, is applied to the tight fitting pink
cloth bodice. At the back there are little
lace tails and there is a pink panne belt,
which holds the tails down very tight and
comes around to the front and hooks un
der a steel buckle.
With a street costume it is a good thing
to use the side buckle, so that the beauty
of this piece of jewelry Is not hidden
under the front of the -blouse. Of course
you must have a buckle to match it on
the other side. The back of the belt is
high, small and plain, but the front may
be pulled low and puffed, or elaborated
in any way one pleases.
There are many varieties of gowns from
which one may choose in order to have
the fashionable town costume. There are
numerous colors, ranging from light pink
to dark brown. And there are a great

such that they were more than eager to
meet the company, half way in the task
of settling the controversy. The men rec
ognized their power, but they did not
choose to exercise It to the prolongation
of the public inconvenience by straining
at gnats. The ultimatum of the company
was a virtual surrender to the union, al
though by a mere Juggling of words for

Mayor Schmftz made the statement' late
last night that the strike was .unparalleled
in the history , of labor. He regarded it
as a great .triumph for the cause of. or
ganized labor and expressed'- the ; belief
that- the settlement 'of the strike would
be of mutual benefit to the railway'com
pany arid : its employes. He Â¦believed 'that
the relations of those affected . "would : be
much, more cordial _ In . the future..- He

they met" the' strikers.- â¢ The -manner; in

is general -; rejoicing . among carmen over
this concession^ . - .. ;c r.':?
The carmen will be allowed to ride freo
of charge upon their divisions
on showing their badges. The obnoxious
rule by which employes were subjected to
degrading espionage, on.. their days gtt ,is
now abolished, thereby ' giving the 'men
freedom of action. Another' concession of
importance is. that of the company agree
ing to submit all disputes with employes i
to committees from the union arid rail
way. In this respect the union, is recog
nized and it was the stand taken by the
company on this proposition which led " to
the acceptance of the terms as offered.
In returning to work the men have been
advisedytyy their leaders to go back with
olit th&'tleast feeling of runfriendliness for
their ernployers; also vtd show, by their
earnest and faithful work that they ap-,
predate the concessions which have "been 1
granted ' them. ...â¢,_.;. .... ->i.

J gratijlated~ last night becaus.e-6f the or

Tfte^strike was. 'also remarkable in that
;it:was\ in Â¦ a\\ probability the most com
plfite^e^er inaugurated in this' or in any
other T) country. Usually in strikes the
unions ''enter the fight with' a- great show
offstrength and come out'of them-partly

menced .their.* fight with but 300 members
arid emerged. from it with over 3000,' or, in

company against which ..the -strike was

(Last, spring I was stricken with,. what the doctors . pronounced liver and' kid-,
ney disease, and lay 'in a semi-conscious, state,, and my death was expected at
any rhoment. Two dofctors eave ine'up. told my family I could not live the
day o6t. - My leet, legs arid whole body were' fearfully swollen, and I was so '
. lame and sore all over that to move In bed almost *took. my life. I gasped for
breath and my* heart's action was so-unnatural as-to cause serious alarm. After
I had been given up -to die by two doctors, my family, knowing that Warner's.
. Safe Cure had done so much for.my daughter, purchased a bottle of Warner's
, Safe Cure and a box.of the pills, ana when I was at the point of death and my 1
â¢ clothe* all waiting to drees me. for my, last" resting place they began to give 1
; me Warner's Safe Cure. I fook, it- every hour or two through the night, and at
; the turn of this same night the kidneys began to act and the swellings grad-
: ually subsided. The fever abated, my lameness Improved and last of all my
breath became natural. I "was drenched \rith perspiration. ;
The whole story, tcfld briefly, is 'this: - 'â¢
From lying at death's door, bloated from head to foot, panting for- breath, .
like a dog after a long Â¦chase, heart â¢ treating ' two beats and skipping two, or â¢
so faint could hardly hear it, pulse a great deal over one hundred, and a stu-
por that could not be controlled, this was my condition -when -I took Warner's
Safe Cure, and I can only say that it saved my life and that it is all that is
claimed for it.
â¢ The doctors called my disease hardening of the kidneys, and it mus^- be quite
a surprise to the doctors to learn that I am doing my housework. Fueling It a
duty I owe to you to write of my wonderful cure, I am yours truthfully (Mrs.)

TEST YOUE KIDNEYS. If any one in your family has ever had kidney
or bladder disease make this simple test and find out if you are afflicted: Put
some morning urine in a glass or bottle, let it stand for twenty-four hours; if
there is a reddish sediment in the bottom of the glass, or if the urine is cloudy
or milky, or if you see particles or germs floating about ln It, your kidneys are
diseased and you should lose no time, but g"et a bottle of Warner's Safe Cure, as
it is dangerous to neglect your- kidneys for even one day. Bright's disease,
gravel, liver complaint, pains in the back, rheumatism, rheumatic gout, in-
flammation of bladder, stone in the bladder, uric acid poisoning, dropsv, ecze-
ma, scrofula, blood disease, offensive odor from ' sweating, so-called "Female
weakness." painful periods, too frequent desire to urinate and painful passing
of urine are all caused by diseased kidneys, and can be speedily cured by War- '
ners Safe Cure, which has been prescribed by leading doctors for twenty-five '

The horse which caused Mrs- Sartori's
death was known to be very wild, and the

husband and others againftt driving the
animal, but, being an expert horsewoman,
never feared any mishap. Mrs. Sartori
will be buried in this city on Monday.
Mrs. Sartcri at about 4 o'clock this af
ternoon had one of her horses hitched
to a road cart, intending to drive to meet
the California and Northwestern train
from the north, which reaches this city
at 5:05 o'clock. Her husband, who had
been on a business trip to the north, was
to arrive from Fairyille. When Mrs. Sar
tori started for the Fourth-street station
she had scarcely left her residence in the
West End before the horse she was driv
ing became troublesome, and when she
reached Fifth street the animal was un
manageable. In trying to run away the
horse shied to one side. Mrs. Sartori, un
prepared for the""m(we. was hurled vio
lently to the ground, her head striking
the stone curbing. Her skull was frac
tured in two places. The horse dashed
down Filth street at great speed, finally
colliding with a fence, where it was
stopped.

have no trouble in gradually, but surely, build
ing up an immense export trade to New Zea-
Knd. The fact that Mr. Spreckels, president of
the Oceanic Steamship Company, has inaugu
rated a new and first-class freight and passen
ger service to the antipodes, the ships being
fitted up with refrigerators and other ' appli

the greater reason why our fruit growers
should be able to dispose of their surplus
stock of fresh and canned fruits in the south

During my five years' residence In New.Zea
land I have never seen a native seedless orange,
but during the last year I hare seen on exhi

good display of our "California Navel
Oranges" and those who have eaten them are
very much pleased with them.

He said that when he went to New Zea
land in 1S97 he found very few articles of
American manufacture, in any of the
shops of Auckland, or in the colony itself,
but since that year a great change has
come about. He said one may now visit
any of the Auckland stores and find al
most everything in the way of American
goods. Our exports to New Zealand, he
says, have more th?.n tripled during the
past four years, yet the ground has
scarcely been developed. Further dis
cussing the subject Consul Dillingham
Bald:
ThÂ« new tariff which has recently, gone Into
effect Jn Federated Australia, or, the "Com
monwÂ«alth" as It Is more commonly called. Is
creating a great deal of adverse â¢ criticism
among the adherents of free trade. Especially
Is thla feeling observable in Sydney, a beautiful
city oÂ» over half a million people. Prices have
advanced oharply since the port of Sydney be
came a part of tho commonwealth, and customs

The woman was discovered by a Mra

was attracted to Mrs.- Hammer's room
by moans shortly after the noon hour.
and found the unfortunate woman lying
on a couch in agony. Mrs. McMahon
asked her what was the matter with her.
Mrs. Hammer replied, "I have taken car
bolic acid," and when asked why she did
so, incdherently answered, "Trouble,

. NORF.OLK, Va., April 26.â An American
system : of wireless -telegraphy, perfected
by R. A. Fessenden, working under the
direction of W. L. Moore, chief of the
Weather Bureau, was tested at Roanoke
Island to-day. It was established beyond
a doubt that by the new. system wireless
messages can be sent to vessels at sea for
a distance of over 200 miles.
The Government has a testing station
at Weer Point, on the northeast shoals of
Rcanoke Island, and another about seven
miles west of Cape Hatteras. The two
stations are fifty-three miles apart. The
Intervening points* are on Pimlico Sound.
The tests made by Professor Fessenden
show that the energy required for suc
cessful transmission over such brackish
water is about 360 times greater than
over salt water under the same condi
tions.
At each station a, mast 143 feet high 1%
ejected for the carrying of five copper
wires strung twelve inches apart.
The transmitting apparatus consists of
the usual induction coil common with
other, systems of wireless telegraphy, but
the receiving apparatus la altogether dif
ferent from that in use in other systems.
A telephone system is employed and mes
sages can be sent and received as rap
idly as by land wires and with far greater
rapidity than by cable. . :

Special Dispatch ' to The Call.
NOME, Feb. 10 (via Seattle, April 26.)
"Unlimited quantities of gold lie concealed
beneath the surface of the vast tundra
plains which skirt the Bering coast. Prac
tical investigation has proved this, and
there- is scarcely a shadow of a doubt that
from the tundra plains of this section
hundreds of millions of dollars in gold will
be mined in the years to come." . â¢
This is the statement made to a repre
sentative-of the Nome Nugget by J. XJ.
Picard, a mining engineer who has been
in Nome since 1900. Picard represents , a
New York syndicate, one of its members
being George D. Roberts.- T," > '
Since " the summer of 1900 investigations
of .the tundrar deposits have been pursued
under. Picard's direction. The work that
he has been doing has been kept very
quiet. Reports have been forwarded to
his company and Picard says:
Our company determined to know the forma
tion of the tundra, and - to ascertain Â¦ its value
Mr. Roberts, who was here in 1900 and again
last year, was of the opinion after careful In
vestigation that extensive sold deposits would
be found there, so we began acquiring portions'
of '.the tundra, and the company now owns
eleven 160-acre tracts between Nome and
Penny River.
Fuel Right at Hand.
Last fall and this winter I have put down
a large number of holes to bedrock, using a
Keystone boring . drill for the purpose. The
section we prospected thoroughly extends be
tween Holyoke Creek and beyond the Wild
Goose railroad track. .
Â« The depth to bedrock I found varied from,
forty to eighty feet, and I also discovered
another fact: .,The gravel, which begins about
eight feet below the surface, is not frozen, as
I had supposed. I also found that what may
be called the surface deposit, about eight feet
in dentil, consists mostly of peat, which can be
used for fuel, thus setting at rest the question
of a fuel supply for the machinery necessary
to work the tundra on a large scale. The peat
therefore, will not interfere with the economi
cal operations of Â¦ the machinery, as it can
be used for fuel, and thus a double purpose is
UJ The values are almost beyond computation
ihe depth to bedrock, as I have said, averages
from 40 to SO feet, with about eight feet of
peat. The rest I found to be a gravel deposit
carrying gold In- large . quantities. I found
Â¦raj* 1 aver a g lng 54 87 to the cubl(J Â°
n^ sS r! 2 i feet - *I n ano'her hole sunk it aver
aged $3 64; in another, ?6 10, while still another
showed an average value of $5. and one reached
La* m ftP 18 2Â° west avâ¬ra ee to the cubic yard
was $3 64. Any one who cares to do so can
figure the amount of gold at these values there
is in an acre or a square mile.
Tundra of Glacial Origin.
Picard discovered another . interesting
fact which goes to . show that the sea
never at any time, so far as these\ depos
its show, covered what is now the tundra
back to the hills, as has been generally
supposed. After an elevation of sixty feet
is reached back on the tundra there are
no indications of sea sand. In Picard's
opinion the tundra deposits are the result
ojf glacial action. .
Picard has prospected the bottom of the
sea in front of Nome. This is what he
found: At a depth of ten feet, $7 to the
cubic yard; at twenty-two feet, $43 54
(but there was a small nugget in the lat
ter sample) ; at thirty feet, $11 25. The
lowest value he found was $2 to the cubic
yard. *' , . , : Â¦
Picard's Company, will -work the tundra
on a large. scale, commencing next sum
mer. The bottom of the sea will also, be
made to give up Its gold, and this will be
effected by the running of a tunnel from
the shore out as far as it is desired to go

Supervisor Loughrey said the unions
would object to detailing policemen tp

hall said that the boat would save twen
ty-five men on the land watch. Wittman
also urged the building of a brick stable,
at a cost'of $5000/ which would save $3500
per year in rents, and requested that his.
men be relieved from doing repair, work,
and an allowance made bo the Board of
Works could do the work. The commit
tee took the estimate under advisement.
The members of the Police Commission
and Chief Wittman appeared before the
Supervisors' Finance Committee yester
day to urge that the various appropria
tions asked by the commission- for the
conduct of the Police Department during
the next fiscal year be granted. The com
mission made a special plea that 184 addi
tional patrolmen be provided for. Chief
Wittman' explained that the proposed in
novation of eight-hour watches, was pos
sible. only with the number mentioned. If
the Auditor's recommendation for 100 ad
ditlonallpatrolmen were accepted It would
be Impossible to properly police the city
in' certamTdistrlcts. Wittman said:
'TJnderitbe charter we should be al
lowed 800 - policemen, but we will have
only 693 in. all if you grant our request.
It Is 'a fact that we have had policemen
do painting, plumbing and Â¦ carpenter
work, but we were compelled to do so be
cause no funds were provided for the pur
pose. -We absolutely need a patrol boat

So admirable. were the arguments and
so deftly handled were they Â¦ that the
judges. Dr. W. B. Howard and. Professor
L. T. Hengstler, were in long deliberation
before coming to a conclusion. > : "-;.:?. 1
Ultimately,- Judge F. Dunne, the referee
of the debate, announced that for indi
vidual excellence of treatment of . the
argument, George Presley of the Hum
boldt School carried off the honors, but
the judges had concluded Â¦; that . the Lin
colns had presented the best general aver
age,'therefore the decision was in favor
of the negatives. . .
The debate on both sides was powerfully
carried through, the speakers showing an
intimacy witti the Intricate subject that
would have been worthy of well-informed
parliamentarians. Â¦
The question before the house was, "Re
solved, That the Filipinos should not be
given their immediate .. independence."
Those who'argued "in the affirmative, rep
resenting the Humboldt School, were:
Thomas Forsyth, Frederick Dunstan and
George Presley. The negatives . . (Lin

the first debate for, the William R. Hearst
cup, which goes to the university winning
the first three debates.
The speakers from, the University of
Californiaâ Max Thelen, Walter Roth
ctild and Ralph S. Pierceâ took the af
firmative side of the question, and Her
bert C. Jones, George W. Leistner and
Fletcher B. Wagner of Stanford argued
for the negative. The debate was opened
by Max Thelen of the U. C. team and
closed by Walter. Rothchlld of the same
team. Each speaker was allowed twenty
minutes, the affirmative having ten min
utes additional in which to close the ar
gument. John F. English of Stanford and
F. M. Allen of U.'C. acted as timekeepers.
Team work, individual eloquence and a
clever setting forth of -convincing mate
rial won for the University of California
at the Metropolitan Temple between
picked teams from Berkeley and Stan
ford. While the Stanford boys put 'up a
fine fight, they were unquestionably ex
celled in every point. The* hall was
crowded, a crowd of U.'C. rooters occupy
ing the lefthand side of the balcony, the
Stanford men holding the righthand side.
The boys kept the ball in a state of ap
plause preceding the entrance of- the de
baters with their songs, yells and witty
sayings.
"When the decision was announced the
noise arising from the U. C. sympathizers
would have made Market street on the
night of the tie-up take a back seat.
The judges were Judge M. C. Sloss,
Judge R. C. Harrison and Judge. F. J.
Murasky. The decision was announced by
Judge Harrison five minutes after the
close of the debate. The decision was, in
accordance with the "extracts from inter

by balloting without previous discussion.
President Jordan presided, and although
he requested the v audience to refrain from
interrupting the speakers, the people could
not at times contain themselves.-.

NAPA. April '26.â The application of Â¦
Frank Matthai, who killed George Stan
ley of Oakland In this county a few years
ago in a dispute over a mining claim in
Chile* Valley, to be admitted to ball pend
ing his second trial has come up for hear
ing in the Superior Court on several oc
casions and has been continued from tlmo .
to time at the request of the defendant.
Matthai was convicted of manslaughter
and sentenced to serve five years in San
Quentin. He appealed to the Supremo
Court and was granted a new trial by
that â¢ tribunal. - "When the case was re
turned to this county for another trial
Matthai applied to be admitted to bail,
and . after giving the question careful
consideration Judge Ham decided to grant
the defendant's request and bail was fixed
at J5C00. Up to the present he has only
been able to obtain bondsmen In the per
sons of his two sisters. Misses Rose and
Louise Matthai of San Francisco. Dis
trict Attorney Bell will not accept theso
sureties.
The case was called in court again yes
terday, and at the request of the de
fendant's attorney, "Wallace T. Ruther
ford, was continued until Monday morn
ing for further consideration.,
District Attorney Bell then made 'a
startling: statement in court. He said
that he desired to bring to the notice of
the court the action of the Matthai sis
ters. . He said that they had sworn In '
court that they, or their family, owned
property in Tehama County worth $10,000.
whereas upon investigation he found It to
be valued at about $300; that they had :
sworn to the possession of property in
Butte County worth $10,000, which, ha
said, he had ascertained had some time
since been sold to the State for taxes. '
Such action, he declared, was an imposi
tion on .the court which came very near
perjury, and he desired to warn Ruther
ford,, their attorney, that in case of sim
ilar conduct in the future he might find
it necessary to proceed against them for
perjury; that he would not accept any of
the Matthais as sureties on any bond.
District - Attorney Bell made a special
trip to Tehama and Butte counties early
in the week to investigate the property,
there and filed with the clerk of the court
affidavits of citizens of those counties in
support of his charges. ,
This new phase In this murder casn

ters are making for their brother's free

Says He Mad e Her Life Mis
erable by Repulsing Her
"': Advances. :
To be told that she has become a source
of : annoyance and '.: irritation to a man
upon :. whom she 'â¢ has , lavished her affec
tions ; for almost : three decades is a fate
reserved 1 for. few women.- ~ One of the few
is Mrs. Julia Rulofson, former wife' of
Alfred i C. Rulofson, buyer for the firm of
Baker & Hamilton and putative heir of
the wealth of the late Captain Winslow
G Hall. Under the kindly ? cloak of the
legal phrase "incompatibility of teniper"
Mrs. Rulofson sought relief, ; and in the
divorce court she was freed from a yoke
which for several years has been solely
the means of making her life miserable.
The divorce was granted by Judge Heb
bard yesterday. \>
Rulofson did not appear to contest the'
suit, - though in \ his answer to . her com
plaint he denied all the allegations made
by his wife. Mrs. Rulofson appeared in
court, accompanied ,only by her lawyet
and Mrs. Clara Reading, her married
daughter, whose .testimony concerning the
disposition of. her father corroborated
that of her mother. Mrs. Rulofson was
visibly affected " as ' she took the witness
stand to tell of her husband's cruel treat
ment. . She Â¦ sobbed': hysterically and wa3
only prevented .Â¦ from breaking down
through the kindly efforts of her attorney
and the soothing words addressed to her
by Judge Hebbard and Mrs.- Reading.
Composing herself as best she could she
told the following story: .
I was married to Mr. . Rulofson In July, 1873.
"We lived happily for several years, but I soon
noticed a change In his treatment of me. He
became irascible, fitful and ill-tempered, ami
when I sought to show him any wifely atten
tion he would fly into a rage and revile and
vilify me. ' I tried to win back his love, but my
efforts seemed to cause him displeasure, which
he vented before his family.
On February 16 of this year he left home on
a business trip and on his return, about the
first <)f March. -. I â¢ again tried . to regain my
place In his affections, but' it was all to no
avail. Â¦ He told me that he no longer loved me
and that I had become distasteful to him. ' He
told me also that whatever love he had had for
me had been alienated. He not only , told me
this, tut also told others that he no longer
cared for me.
Mrs. "Reading corroborated her mother's
testimony, describing her father's fre
quent Â¦ outbursts .of anger and 1 ' his treat
ment of her for several years prior to the
commencement of the suit for divorce.
Judge Hebbard in granting the decree of
divorce awarded - Mrs. - Rulofson the cus
tody of the" only minor child of the
couple, Gladys J. Rulofson, aged 16 years.

There are not many ministers who
would be willing to publicly I indorse
and recommend a cure of this " kind,
with the statement that they them-
selves had been cured by it, but -the
Rev. Crawford has in him a great
deal of true gratitude and love of man-
kind. This is shown in a recent letter
In which he says that he makes public
acknowledgment "in order that others
may receive the same happy results."
Among those whose attention has
been attracted by this magnanimous
offer is the Rev. J. S. B. Crawford of
Waynesvllle, N. C, a very prominent
divine, whose own vitality was serious-
ly impaired. Being sick of paying
money to quacks and charlatans, who
took his money without doing him any
good, Mr. Crawford had the prescrip-
tion made up and took it regularly, as
he was directed. With this result, he
was perfectly cured, and after several
years of enjoyment of his newly givan
powers, made the statement publicly
that every man in need of help should
do likewise. BSSfe
tome fifteen years ago the writer gave atten-
tion to the cure of nervous disorders and !
lound that the late Dr. Wilson. Professor of j
Chemistry and Practitioner of Medicine In
Btllevue Medical Collete of New York, had a J
formula of wonderful power to restore to men
the fullness of their physical and mental
etrength. In the year 1SS3 the celebrated Dr.
WIlEon died and his formula haa been obtained
by L. F. Page of 201 State street, Marshall.

original prescription, and from our anal] r eis of
the eame, by our Board of Investigation, we
lind it composed of pure and fresh drugs, and
that it is sold under the name of "Dr. Wil-
son's Restorative Remedies." Our Investiga-
tion was extended into a great number of simi-
lar preparations, non4 of which were found
equal to the above, while many were prepared
by those who knew little or nothing- about
therapeutics or materia tnedlca. We hereby
caution the public against the use of all urcer-
tain remedies and all who need nerve-life

Read the following:, by William Cole,
M. D., Washington, D. C.'. published in
the United States Investigating Re-
ports, regarding the prescription from
which this remedy for curing Lost
Manhood is prepared:
During the examination of men for the army
during our recent war with Spain, our United
States army physicians were shocked to find
bo large a percentage of men disqualified be-
cause of nervous disorders. It is net the pur-
pose of these reports to enter into a statement
of causes, other than to Eay that the sufferer
is seldom to blame. His condition is indeed
deplcrabie; his memory fails him, his energy
Â«one, his eyesight dimmed, his muscles solt
and his nervous stamina, gone. He is pitied
by those/versed in nervous disorders and re-
pelled by those of both sexes who do not un-
derstand how dark the world Is to him.

No demonstration was made at the closo
of the meeting. The men, after spending
two 1 hours or more in the . theater, left
quietly and sought the nearest route
home In order to be ready for work this
morning. Many of them reported for in
structions at their car barns and those
that were ready for work were at Â¦ once
sent out. The majority, however, pre
ferred to rest after the strain to which
they had been subjected during the past
week.
In accordance with, the request of the
United Railroads,' as the men were leav
ing the hall a ballot was taken on the
proposition whether 23V6 cents an hour
with a bonus for years of service or a
flat rate of 25 cents an hour should be ac
cepted. The vote In favor of the "latter
proposition was practically unanimous.'
"That is the man that made your union
as strong as it is," said Casey, pointing'
to Mayor Schmitz. "Keep up his good
work. . Go direct to your homes. Do not
visit saloons or ' give any extravagant
demonstrations of your joy. Do not brag
about the successful ending of your
strike. You have won the respect of the
people of San Francisco and the United
States, and now keep it. Let everybody
see that you can In the hour of your tri
umph conduct yourselves in the same
gentlemanly manner as you have done
during the last week."
Michael Casey, . Commissioner of Pub
lic Works, and president of the City Front
Federation, was the next speaker. He
was greeted with cheers. He said that
all credit was due to Mayor Schmitz, and
that had there been a Mayor like him in
office during the troubles of last year the
laboring men would have their just de

the interested parties have developed it is to be
hoped will - be maintained and enlarged to 'the
betterment of the public f.Tvlce, the profit of

My own position in this contest has been a
most delicate and trying one. I have endeav
ored to do my whole duty to both Bides and
have ' devoted my days and my nlKhts toward
securing a fair, and amicable adjustment. I
appreciate profoundly and desire to express my
thanks for the congratulatory messages of con
fidence, . encouragement and \ support which
have come to me from every hand, and all of
which I cannot hope to acknowledge In person.
It would be unjust, however, If I did not pub
licly recognize the effective â¢ and welcome as
sistance received by me In these anxious days
from- others and especially the devotion and
fidelity of my legal adviser, Mr. Ruef , whose
good judgment . and wise counsel . contributed
largely to the peaceful conclusion reached.'
On behalf of the citizens of San Francisco I
express the satisfaction which exists in every
home and fireside, at every workshop and fac
tory. In every place of business, at the friendly
and peaceful, ending of the strike and the hope
ful Indication of the prosperity and progress
which peace and good will on every hand are
certain to engender. .
The United Railroads of San Francisco de
serve much credit for the friendly spirit of fair
ness and of just compromise exhibited by them
on familiarity with the real status of affairs,
and the people of San Francisco are to be con
gratulated upon the good feeling which has
prevailed during this period of great inconveni
ence," upon' the* reasonable and business-like
course of > both parties to this controversy .and
upon ! the peaceful . settlement which at once
brings to an end perhaps the strongest and
most Â¦ forceful â¢ strike In â¢ the ' city's history,
marked neither by terrorism, ' violence, blood
shed nor riot. . â¢ Â¦
This strike, like almost all strikes, was a
matter 1 of regret,' but unlike all others, in Its
peaceful example and in its substantial results,
it is a source of eventful rejoicing. The men of
the Street Railway Employes' Union are enti
tled , to the greatest public commendation "and
praise for their moderation, their reasonable

9"^ E negotiations yesterday between
the officials of the United Railroads
and the union carmen which ter
minated the strike were marked by
earnestness on one side and enthusiasm
on the other. It was a day which will
live long in the memory of those who
took an active part in the proceedings.
The executive committee of the United
Railroads was in session at 9:30 a. m.
Early in the morning a cipher dispatch
was received from the Eastern owners,
and pending the arrival of the committee
this was deciphered and its contents
made known to the directors. The dis
patch counseled an immediate settlement
ot the strike on honorable terms, and it
vested the directors with absolute discre
tion in the matter. President Holland
sent a messenger to the Mayor announc
ing that the company was willing to sub
mit its terms to the union carmen. The
Mayor communicated the welcome Intel
ligence to the executive. committee of the
carmen's union, and within an hour the
committee was on its way to the com
ptny's offices.
HEPLY OF COMPANY.
Before entering upon a discussion of the
company's terms the following communi
cation was read to the committee:
To the Committee of the Employes of the
Vnited Railroad* of San Francisco â Gentle
men: The officers of the United Railroads of
San Francisco have carefully considered y;our
demands and have conferred by wire with the
representative of the owners in the Ecet and
have made up our answer to your request. We
do this Â¦with a sincere desire to establish- and
maintain good relations with you and the men
you represent. '
Speaking lor the directors of the United
Railroads of San Francisco I assure you we
desire to act In a. fair, just and liberal spirit
in arranging with you for peace and harmony
and the faithful and loyal services of the men
who have been employed by the companies
from whom the United Railroads of San Fran
cisco have bought the properties, and we be
lieve you will find that, while there are some
of your requests that the company cannot
agree to, the real, vital demands have been
conceded and the concessions asked from you
ehould be allowed to the owners who have In
vested their money In the properties.
We ask you to take a vote by ballot of the
men you represent upon the wage .question and
certify to us the result, and whatever under
etanding: we may a&ree upon we shall on be
half of the company, and shall expect you on
behalf of the men you represent, to carry out
the same in good faith. Respectfully,
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
United Railroads of San Francisco.
CARMEN DISSATISFIED.
Harry A. Knox acted as chairman of
the committee, which was closeted with
the executive committee of the United
Railroads from 11:30 a. m. till shortly
after noon. When the carmen's commit
tee left the meeting- it went immediately
to the Turk-street Temple. With the ex
ception of Chairman Knox the men de
clined to discuss the situation. Knox said
that the executive committee of the
United Railroads refused to recognize the

When the executive committee , of the
carmen's union went upon j the stago, It
was greeted with grousing'. ' volley, of
cheers. As each: man' who was.<promi T

recognized he i was named \ "and ' lustily
cheered. Although the men had been
waiting for over an hour and a half they
were in good humor. They had .been en
tertained with. speech' and, song and 'the
prospect of an early settlement, of their
troubles made them . feel , happy. â¢.-Â¦*Â¦
CHEERED ON ENTERING.
As soon as Casey had concluded : his
speech Commltteemen Dingwell . and
Johnson went after Mayor Schmitz. The
remainder of the committee went to ',. the
Alhambra Theater. Before, leaving the
rooms where the executive committee had
met during the week a vote was taken on
the . propositions submitted' ;by .v the
United Railroads, and It was unanimously
decided to' recommend the acceptance 'of
all the propositions. . . . . v
"Boys," said Casey, "you have got al
most everything â¢ you asked for and a
great deal more. Now settle the matter
quickly; the people and the press are
with you. Recommend the. acceptance of
these propositions and you will not make
a mistake." >Â¦ \
The members of the arbitration com
mittee of the striking carmen went down
for a second time to the office of the
TJnited Railroads and held a further con
ference. In the meanwhile word was sent
out to all the members of the Carmen's
Union to assemble at headquarters in or
der to hear the report of the arbitration
committee. About 4:30 p. m. the men be
gan coming in, and it was soon found
that it would be impossible to accom
modate all within the building., -
As the men were congregating arrange
ments were made to secure the . Alham
bra Theater. . | "Doc" Leahy of the Tivoli
soon had It opened, and the men left their
place of meeting about 5 o'clock. The
delegation from the Mission-street power
house, some 500 strong, were headed by
a coupleof men carrying flags, and were
followed by the men of the other 'lines
according to their numerical strength.
Over the same questions as to the rec
ognition of the union the committee again
split on their return. All other clauses
were satisfactory. The carmen ; at ; the
Alhambra Theater patiently awaited: the
result. Secretary Rosenberg of the San
Francisco Labor Council was first, called
In and addressed the arbitration com
mittee. He advised them to accept the
offer of . the railway ' company. Later
Michael Casey of the. City Front Federa
tion and President "Goff of the j Labor
Council came In and added the weight of
their influence toward an early settle

ground that the union was not recog
nized. It was held by some of the more
rabid union men that the superscription
should have been "Division No. 205, Amal
gamated Association of Street Railway
employes of America." Upon this point
the arbitration committee divided,
claiming that their union was not recog
nized by the railroad company.
Another point that was fully considered
was that requiring all new men to join
the union after thirty days' service with
the company. It was held that under this
provision the company could stuff its
roll of employes with new men and dis
rupt the organization. It was decided
then to seek another conference with the
directors of the United Railroads and
through Mayor Schmitz a second meeting
was arranged. ;. - w*

Mayor Schmitz was the first who was
requested to speak. A second demonstra
tion was rnaoe when he appeared, and al
though he endeavored to' quiet his aiidl
euce, he could. not do so until they had
tired themselves with cheering. Mayor
Schmitz spoke in part as follows:
CONGRATULATES MEN.
Chairman Knox then explained that It
was agreed with the United Railroads
that the new schedule would not go into
effect until June 1, as far as the ten-hour
workday was concerned, but that the
wages and overtime would be paid from
the time the cars started running. This
was satisfaetniy, as it was explained that
it would rako that length of time to re
arrange the time schedules. ; " -
A vote was then' taken upon the-ques
tion of accepting 23^4 cents an hour with
ai bonus or a flat rate of 25 cents.' The
latter was unanimously accepted. Then
came the congratulatory speeches.
During the reading of the reports May
or Schmitz appeared upon .' the stage.
Hardly had he emerged from the wings
than the entire crowd of strikers rose on
their feet and gave him an ovation. Hats
were thrown In the air; canes were
waved, flags were unfurled, and cheer
after cheer : resounded throughout the
building. For fully five minutes the
Mayor was compelled to stand up before
the, shouting enthusiasts. President Cor
nelius vainly rapped for order,, but it
needed more than the sound of his gavel
to overcome thÂ« tumult that was made.
Finally, as the Mayor sat down, the. hub
bub subdued and the business was allowed
to proceed.
OVATION TO MAYOR.
Kach clause was taken up in Its order
and a vote taken upon it.' Not a dissent
ing-voice was raised to the acceptance <of
any of the .proportions, although there
was /some f little discussion \upon a - few
points UuiVilid not apparently seem clear,'
All were unanimously adopted, however.
soon as possible introduced Harry A.
Knox, the chairman of the arbitration
committee. Knox met with a similar re
ception. He wus cheered to the echo, and
at once began to reafl the terms of the
agreement submitted by the United Rail
roads. .' : " \ ' , C
GO TO HEADQUARTERS.
After the arbitration committee of. the
striking carmen left the office of the
United Railroads they at once returned to
their headquarters in the. Turk-street
Temple and resumed consideration of the
offer made In response to original
demand. The first thing that Jarred the
commltteemen was the manner in which
the reply of the United Railroads was ad
dressed to them. This was as follows :
"From the United Railroads of San
Francisco to Its conductors, motormen
and gripmen." < t
An objection was made to this on the
One by one the officials of the United
Railroads left the building. Manager Vln
ing was one of the last to go. He has
been guarded the last few days by a pri
vate detective, who accompanies him all
the way home. In the same way his chief
clerk is also afraid of bodily harm and is
shadowed home. On the other hand, not
one of the directors appeared to be afraid
of any trouble, and all walked through
the streets without the slightest trace of
fear. â¢ x -
President Holland refused to Ije inter
viewed after the final meeting. But he
evidently meant business, as he told ths
stenographer that had been specially en
gaged during the last few days that there
would be nothing mort for him to do that
nJght and that he need not report again
until he was sent for.
"It Is simply a case of where the com
pany has made a generous offer," he said.
"It is now up to the carmen to say
whether they will accept or not. We are
all through. We have given them our
terms, and nothing will be done until they
accept them."
HELLMAN'S VIEWS.
"There is still a hitch," Hellman said.
"We want to deal In the future with our
employes. We are not opposed to the
union; In fact, we are favorably disposed
to it. We think that organizations of this
kind are only for good â they make the
men more manly. At the same time we
want to deal with our own men. We
don't want outsiders coming in and' dic
tating to us. At any time that a- com
mittee calls on us it may be composed of
all union men, but the only committees
that we will listen to must be composed
of our own employes."
TIrey L. Ford was next seen. He seemed
discouraged with the situation.
"They won't recognize our union," said
Chairman Knox, "and until they do the
fight will go on forever. Why, if we were
to settle the affair now the union carmen
would mob us when we went back."
Among the directors of the United Rail
roads I. W. Hellman was the first to
leave the company's office.
The afternoon meeting of the two forces
continued about an hour. The carmen's
committee were the first to leave. On
their vacating the rooms of the street car
company the members were surrounded
by representatives of the press.
The executive commtitee of the 6treet
railways left the offices In the Wells-
Far&o building one by one a short time
later. They considered that they had
made the striking carmen a most liberal
offer, and they expressed the belief that
it was only a question of a few hours
when the controversy would be settled.

their attitude on that point the strike
would be on forever.

WHY DRUCS FAIL-Many Men Treated for Weakness Which
Never Existedâ Failure Due to Wrong Diagnosis.
, There Is a tendency nowadays to ascribe case? of lost vitality to lack of nerv*
force and to treat them as such, with tonics, _ electricity and stimulants, resulting la
but the most temporary beneflt^ir at all.
As a result of : observations, and practical experience. I have been convinced â¢ that
the nerves play but a subsidiary role in the production of disorders of men. It Is
very unusual to find' any trouble In an otherwise rtrnr.sr man other than a damaged
prostate or deep urethral Inflammation, particularly in those whose disorders origi-
nated in too lone continued and too often repeated excitement, . or the harmful Influ-
ence exercised by an ill-treated contracted disorder, and if exhausted nerve force
seemed to be present, it is only as a concomitant, or perhaps we may say a compli-
cation of chronic . prostatttls, and disappeared with,' its cure. Still further, these
facts are .verified by purely local treatment, for procedures directed toward repairing
I the damaged sland nre always rewarded "by the most brilliant cures. Â¦,

It is to be hoped; /that a considerable number of representative; San Franciscans can find it
convenient to make an to the county. It is certain that a knowledge of; the resources
and beauties of, the district, acquired by actual sight, will .augment: the} enthusiasms ' of the sup
porters of the promotion: ! movement and increase their ability to help the enterprise. . In addition
to the profit likely to be derived from the visit, it is worth while also to consider the pleasure of it.
A holiday is always ;wprth;having at this season of the year;and there is no better place on the globe
to enjoy it than : among? the hospitable people of Tuiare/ V'.
When once a movement is started it should be kept moving, and whatever helps to keep up
the motion is good. This invitation from Tulare is " a good evidence that the people ; of the interior
are eager to ,be;at work in r the;promqtipn enterprise, and that they.also wish to see something going
on. It is all well enough^men to know that alotofadvertising is being done in tfe East and
a great Ideal; of good .'work 'in .San Francisco,; but the people of the interior will naturally wish to
have visible : d^monst ration";. that the movement is a big/thing and has a /strbng body of men to
back it. Excursions;: to; difTererit parts of > Northern (California ; will therefore be efficacious in keep
"ingalive locai:zeal;asjwell^s : increasing the knowledge; and Augmenting the efficiency: of the San
Francisco promotersrlt/is to^be; hoped then that the Tulare invitation will: be" accepted,, and ; that

FROM Tulare there conies an invitation to the businessmen of San Francisco, to visit the
county and-see the sights. It is a cordial invitation- and it comes timely and pertinent to
the moveinentnpw under way for promoting the welfare of Northern California. Our busi
ness men, as the Visalia Times says, /'ought to be acquainted with i the character of land in
the different sections, fincl out ;whether ; it is held at reasonable prices, what the chances are for prof

WELL-KNOWN -ACTOR AND
ACTRESS WHO OPEN AT THE
COLUMBIA TO-MORROW.
THE concert programme of last
week contained the unusual item
of an organ recital, further un
usual in being worthy in pro
gramme and competently ren
dered. I do not remember of late any
other Instance of this form of entertain
ment (with the exception of one other
programme by the same organist that I
unfortunately missed), not indeed since
the recitals on the Stanford organ during
the Epworth League Convention of last
year. The recital in question, was given
on Thursday evening last at Trinity
Church by Louis H. Eaton, who succeed
ed Dr. H. J. Stewart at the Trinity
Church organ. Mr. Eaton's programme
attracted .me in the first instance, for I
found thereon some of the noblest contri
butions to organ literature, and In the
second place, as an executant I found
him distinctly worthy of consideration.
I discovered further that Mr. Eaton held
congenial views on the whole duty of or
ganists, a subject on which I confess to
having opinions myself.
/ It is in def erenc* to these views that
Mr. Eaton conceives it his pleasurable
duty to do something to further the cause
of organ-playing here that his confreres
of the craft have so lamentably permitted
to drop into the background. Dr. Stewart
did much during his incumbency at Trin
ity Church with his Sunday recitals after
the afternoon service. Mr. Eaton contin
ued the good work, and now with the dis
appearance of the Sunday afternoon serv
ice has inaugurated the present series of.
week night recitals. The first recital was
well attended, that of Thursday night
rather sparsely, owing, no doubt, to the
strike. The next should see a good audi
ence, for Mr. Eaton handles his instru
ment very effectively and provides the
best of organ fare. He is also assisted
by singers from the Trinity choir, who
add a "welcome variety to the programme.
Here is the Thursday evening pro
gramme. In which Mr. Eaton was assisted
by Miss Millie Flynn:
Johaan Sebastian Bach (1CSS-17I.0), Toccata
and FuguÂ« in C major, toccato, allegretto,
adagio, fugue; Louis Nicolas Clerambault
(1676-1749). prelude; Johann Bebastlaa Bach.

Et. John Passion). Mise Flynn; Alfred Hollins.

Gullmant (1SS7), cp. 17, "Funeral March and
Hymn of geraphs"; Antonla Dvorak (1842), so
prano eolo, "Oh, Grant Me in thÂ« Dust to
Fall," from St. Ludmlla, Miss Flynn; Felix
Alexandra Gullmant, op. 15, "Cantilena Pas
torale"; Felix Alexandra Gullraant, op. 80, So
nata Xo. 5. a) Allerro Appassionato, (H) Ada-
Brio con molt, espresslone, (III) Scherzo. (TV)
Recltatlvo. (V) Choral and Fugue.
Gullmant, the famous French organist,
whose name figures so prominently on
the foregoing programme, is Mr. Eaton's
musical sponsor. The Trinity Church or
ganist, who was then of New Bedford,
Massachusetts, beard Gullmant during
one of bis American tours and followed
him to Paris. He studied there with the
clever Frenchman and now preaches his
creed enthusiastically. Naturally Guil
mant is his god of the organ bench,
though Mr. Eaton would perhapa allow
the other great Frenchman. ' "WIdor. to be
his prophet. At any rate the Widor sym
phonies are prominent numbers on his
recital programmes.
Mr. Eaton is a little disappointed in us.
He Is struct by the fact, as every organ
ist must be, of the absence of a fitting
music hall here, equipped with a.' suitable
organ. Then onr Laodicean attitude in
symphony matters strikes the energetic
Easterner with something like dismay.
One recalls now scene, now another,

Willard's art, with its ; constant accom

accomplished actor -fills in the picture
with eminent satisfaction. /As the Car
dinal Mr. .Willard ; has Â¦ a 1 widely different
role and , his' lofty, performance is another
triumph of versatility.'
It almost seems as if there might be a
chance at the play out here, in the course
of the year or so that usually elapses be
tween the Eastern production and its
Western echo. But why not for once be
to the fore with a simultaneous- produc
tion?. I do not see why the Grand Opera
house should not produce it during the
Morgan-Fealey season. If Jh-. Morgan
can play Romeo to Miss Kealey's Juliet
as Is programmed for their forthcoming
engagement, certainly there is no good
reason why he should not play Paolo to
Miss Fealey's Francesca. And from what
I can gather the young star should make
a charming daughter of the' house of Ri
mini. There would be no scenic dlfflcultie*
in the way of production. Under Mr
Ackerman's regime the theater has be
come, famous for the handsome and cor
rect settings afforded to every play put or
there. Also, not unimportant, the Grand
Opera-house stock company would be
competent to . furnish a respectable sup
port. What is the matter with "Fran
cesca da Rimini." Mr. Ackerman? -
Mr. Skinner has found considerable
profit in his timely revival of "Fran
cesca," in which he has been appearing
with considerable success in the Eastern
States for some time now. .
If the success attending the Otis Skinner
revival of Boker's version of the pla^âin
spired by the London production of Phil
lips' "Paolo and Francesca"â still con
tinue, it is possible that Easterners may
have the gracious chance of comparison
between the â¢ Boker and d'Annunzio
editions. The Boker edition Is both pic
turesque and dignified, while lacking the
rare poetic grace that distinguishes the
Stephen Phillips drama, and It Is likely
that the .d'Annunzio version will be
marked by still wider differences of at
mosphere and treatment. Â¦ . *
The famous Â»d'Annunzio edition of
"Francesca da Rimini," rejected of the
Roman censorship but madly adored of
the Roman multitudes, will be seen In
Boston next October. Eleonora Duse will
there begin her American engagement, at
the Tremont Theater, and will open with
d'Annunzlo's play. Gustave Salvini may
be the Paolo. -
â¢ Â¦ - â¢ â¢ .
As to the play, Mr. Crawford's work
seems to be of a somewhat supereroga
tory character. There are Boker, Stephen
Phillips, and now d'Annunzio,- each with
a seemly edition of the noble Dante story.
So why Mr. - Crawford? And. the end is
not yet. Already, indeed, one can count
almost as many. versions of the ancient
tale as there were "Nell Gwynnes," dur
ing the. recent restoration of that hand
some orange wench to her merry mon
anrchy. If onlyâ ye gods!â some local
playsmitlvbe not seduced by the boom in
da Rimini s to hammer another Into shape,
to be produced at the Central Theater
with Robert Downing as Paolo!
â¢ :â¢'â¢â¢â¢
The stealing may and mystery of your spirit,
as Phillips' Paolo puts it, will be grateful
to the famous actress IsÂ» matter for specu
lation. Here are not the "raptures and
roses of vice," the Camille, Phaedrs
and Theodora gamut,' =- v to which Bern
hardt has so long attuned her art. It is
a harking back to her. Juliet period, and
as such is bound to be a vastly interest
ing experiment. ' - - '
That delicate air and flowery sigh of you.
Last week was the time set for Its.pro
duction, Paris the place, and one waits to
hear the rest. . Mme. Bernhardt is not at
all the person to sign her name to a fail
ure, and it seems therefore likely that
Mr. Crawford has made a good play out
of the Immortal story. Whether or not
the character of the hapless ladyâ
IT appears that the "divine Sarah" is
again about to betake - herself to the
petticoats that so eminently become
: her. Nor "Hamlet," nor "L'Aiglon,"
nor anything of that ilk is her latest
adventure, but a new adaptation of the
Francesca da Rimini story by F. Marion
Crawford. â¢
Whether business capacity , or scientific research is â¢ doing - most for the advancement of
mankipd is a question not worth .while to discuss. It is fortunate that the world has. the "benefit
of the labors of both. There never was a time when mankind was so uniformly well off as ""-now,
nor when* so many men of high abilities were engaged .In undertakings which make to the ad
vancement of humanity as a whole. If Kelvin and Eliot are right as to the advantage of highly
specialized training we can easily afford to send a host of young men to foreign colleges to^add to
their home learning all that is to be gained abroad. ..There" will .'..always be enough remaining /at
home to attend to business and become the 'millionaires of the future. : : fc: - ~ V T ; ,.;
After referring to the fact that when he graduated from Yale there were but two multi-mil
lionaires in the country, Astor and Vanderbilt, neither of whom was then worth ten millions, and con
trasting the condition to-day when so many vast fortunes are conspicuous, he said: "Most of the
possessors of them have shown a wise generosity in the distribution of their wealth. In no other
country in the world, at no other period, have the rich from their abundance given so lavishly to
education, philanthropy and patriotism. Last year the known sums which were thus contributed
amounted to the high figure of $107,360,000."
. It is to be understood, of course, that the "professions" to which the Harvard scholar re
ferred are not restricted to the old familiar three of church, ' bar and medicine, but include the
whole body of experts, whose work rests upon scientific training. Understood in that broad mean
ing, the statement will hardly be disputed. The greater part of the progress of our time is origi
nated by scientists, and the statesmen and the financiers and the captains of industry are doing not
much more than applying in practice the truths discovered by the expert investigators.
While all that'is true, it must not be overlooked that the practical men of the world are far
more potent and far more, useful than is intimated by Kelvin and Eliot. Senator Depew presented
their side of the case by pointing out in a speech before trie Montauk Club what has been done by
the business magnates of this country, not only in accumulating wealth, extending trade and aug
menting industry, but by applying it to charitable and educationaluses.
Developing his t theme President Eiiot went on to; say: "The social and industrial powers,
and the moral influences which strengthen and uplift modern society, are no longer in the hands:
of legislatures,, or political parties or public men. AH -these political agencies are becoming second
ary and subordinate influences. They, neither originate nor lead; they sometimes regulate and set
bounds, and often impede. The real inventions and motive powers which impel society forward and
upward spring from those bodies of well-trained, alert and progressive men known as. the profes
sions. They give effect to the discoveries or imaginings of genius. All the large businesses and new
enterprises depend for their success on the advice and co-operation of the professions." Â¦
President Eliot, speaking at ColumbiaUniversity and addressing an academic audience, said:
"The progress and prosperity of modern communities is going'' to depend hereafter much more
than ever before on the large groups of highly trained men which the universities are educating."
That statement sustains the view taken by Kelvin, and implies that we are to look for the leaders '
of the future not to the man who can get votes at home, but to;liim who has an enlarged and
special knowledge and skill which^will enable him to command attention and exert influence re
gardless of local favor or prejudice. ""Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢ r
THREE men of first-class eminenceâ Lord Kelvin, President Eliot of Harvard and Se'nator "
Depew â recently spoke \o the American people almost coincidently. They spoke under
widely differing circumstances and upon topics bearing no direct relation to one another,
and yet each of the three had much to say upon the advancement of humanity.
Lord Kelvin spoke to the public through^an interview with represent ativjes of the press on
his arrival ai New York. His theme was the scholarship fund left to Oxford by Cecil Rhodes for
the benefit of students from the United States, Germany and the British colonies. "The aver
age young man," said Kelvin, "should .begin his career when he is twenty-one years old, and he
ought to take his university course in his own country. For such men the Rhodes bequest will be
of no advantage, but those who are to. be. scientists or scholars must have six or eight years of
training in the universities, and it is of advantage to them to study in other lands as well as in
their own." Such men, he went on to say, may not become local leaders, .but are likely to be world '
leaders by the influence they exert. through science or. letters.

For one thing here Mr. Eaton has unre
served praise, for the organ-building of
Murray M. Harris of Southern California,
whose fine organ, built for Stanford, oc
cupied so conspicuous a place at the Ep
worth League Convention. "In tone,
mechanism and every way," Mr. Eaton
says, "I think the Stanford organ excels
any instrument I ever played upon. And
those r.re not few. In time I believe
Southern California will be supplying the
larger part of America's pipe organs, at
the least. It appears, though, to return
to the Stanford organ, that it is not per
mitted save to the Stanford organist to
play upon it. If I wished to give a recital
at the university I should not be able,
nor would any other organ player. What
a strange, unmusical dictum, for a great
educational establishment, and it is that
kind of incongruity one is continually be
ing confronted with here. How do you
account for it?"
But I do not account for It. -
Mr. Eaton, by the way, conducted the
Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra for seme
thirteen years. Then the absence of ora
torio activity, the lack of seriousness in
study, the general laissez-faire atmos
phere of California, rather appal the
Eastern musician. He thinks it a case of
abounding talent and small application,
much genius and little conscience, and I
don't know but that he Is right.
CLEVER ORGANIST OF TRINITY
CHURCH WHO GAVE A RECITAL
THURSDAY NIGHT.
All the lines are expected to resume operations this morning. The people can enjoy their day
of rest at the Park or the Cliff, or in the suburbs, as usual, with the assurance'of ample accommo
dation for travel to and from their homes. To-morrow business begins again; and the people
who for a week past have experienced what it is to live without street car accommodations will go
to their work rejoicing that the company and trie employes of the road have had sense enough to
get together on a business basis and resume their important public service.
The terms of agreement appear to be fair to both sides. "It is to be hoped 1 they are so
thoroughly satisfactory to the employes and to the company that there will never be any further
occasion for a strike that will compel the cessation of the cars. There has been a mutual give and
take in reaching the agreement, but neither side has compromised a principle noi; surrendered any
thing vital to. its welfare; so there is no reason why the terms agreed upon may not serve-as a basis
of a lasting peace. . ' . v
While the existence of grievances thai led up to the strike is deplored, both sides are to be
commended for the -manner in which the controversy was conducted from start to finish. The will
ingness of the officials of the road to confer with 'the strikers was , commendable, and so also was
the action of the strikers in consenting to meet the representatives at the railway office instead of
insisting upon a neutral place of meeting. "By reason of the fairness and frankness on each side, '
what threatened to be prolonged to a disastrous deadlock has been settled much more quickly'
than perhaps even the most sanguine expected. ;
WITH the settlement of the street railway strike there comes to the people of San Fran
cisco a universal feeling of relief and satisfaction. The disturbance of: the usual activi
ties of the, city caused'by the cessation of the street cars has brought inconvenience to
-nearly every one and serious losses to many. Moreover as long as. the strike con
tinued there was always the possibility of some blunder on one side or the o;her that would '"make
matters worse. Consequently while the peoplebbre the inconvenience without complaint and faced
the situation cheerfully, there is none the less a deep gratification that the, end: has. been reached
and the normal life of the city is to be resumed

Brings Big Cargo.
After a good deal of individual effort on
the part of Captain Thayer and Captain
Porter, the ship was finally .sailed by
them in the month of March of this year
and anchored safely in the harbor at Pa
peete. Captain Thayer left the vessel at
anchor, under the command of Captain
Porter, and as soon as sails and other
necessary articles are sent to her from
here the Pyrenees will sail for this port
to complete repairs. The captain consid
ers her a good prize..
Anticipating that the sails on board
might not be serviceable, Captain Thayer
repurchased most of the sails that had
been sold at Tahiti before proceeding to
Manga Reva. It was fortunate that he
did so, for the sails, exposed to the tropi
cal winds and rains for a year, were
hanging in rags.
The pumps having been placed on the
Pyrenees and other preliminary work
done, the ship was finally floated, but the
mizzenmast being crippled, it was neces
sary to send all yards and the topgallant
mast down, as sail could not.be carried
on that mast. At the time of the aban
donment of the vessel, one of the ship's
suits of sails had been sold in Tahiti and
another suit had been left aloft.
VESSEL FINALLY FLOATS.
After fourteen days' passag-e, with
thirty- two people aboard the small ves
sel, the Island was reached, but to find
the weather most unfavorable for the
captain's operations. The heavy tropical
rains at the time made it almost impos
sible to provide shelter. When the
weather obstacles were overcome it was
found that the natives were of little ser
vice in handling any machinery or wreck
ing outfit, which threw an enormous
amount of labor on Captain Thayer and
his assistant, Captain Porter.
Not finding sufficient labor there, Cap
tain Thayer headed for the island of Tu
buoi,.where he secured the requisite num-.
ber.of natives and started from, there for
Manga Reva.
He was seated at the banqueting board
on the right of the King- and toasts were
proposed and responded to and~ good will
prevailed. â¢
The arrival of Captain Thayer at the
island of Rurutu was made the occa
sion of a great celebration by the
natives. Every few minutes a new
arrival came with a pig or
chicken or taro slung- across the back
and soon the hot water was ready, , the
pigs and chickens scalded and prepared
and a feast was underway for the brave
American captain. .
of getting the requisite labor in that
group.
Learning that there was better labor to
be had at the Island of Rurutu, BOO miles
south of Tahiti, the captain sailed on his
schooner to recruit twenty men.

not more than ten white people and about
three hundred natives, and any of the
requirements for wrecking do not exist
in that locality.
LEAVES WITH OTJTriT.
Determined, however, to follow up his
purpose, Captain Thayer left San Fran
cisco In October last on the steamer Aus
tralia, taking with him an outfit that he
deemed necessary for the salving of the
Pyrenees. Captain Thayer took with him
as assistant Captain George S. Porter, a
man of considerable experience in the
Arctic. Arriving at Tahiti Thayer char
tered a native schooner of about thirty
five tons to take himself and assistant
and wrecking- outfit to Manga Reva.
The principal business at Manga Rcva
is diving- for pearls and 'shells, and L the

*e^ APTAIN I. E. THAYER returned
fl . to San Francisco on board the
(I ' . Australia yesterday after an ab
\^b^/ sence of eix months' at Papeete,
' Tahiti, and surrounding- Islands,
where he had gone to raise and sail the
wrecked British ship Pyrenees,, which he
purchased many months ago after offers
to sell her on the floor of the Merchants'
Exchange_proved. futile .. â¢ --. .
The captain said yesterday:- "I bought
a pig. lrÂ» x a_p0ke, .hut, abe'.s_all. right, and
before I went out there I was sure, for
some reason or other, that I would save
her." â¢ x \ â¢
The Pyrenees, a steel ship of 2250 tons
register, loaded grain at Tacoma in Sep
tember, 1300, and on ner passage to Eu
rope, when north of the line, a fire was
discovered in her carg-o. Captain Bryce,
her. commander, headed for Pitcairn Isl
and, but on arrival there found that
there was no .shelter for the ship. He (
then rtook aboard two of the-ialanders,
who jpHoted. -him -to Manga-B,eva,-xuie of
the G*mbiar group of islands, . a. distance
of 280 miles from Pitcairn. . There the
vessel was put ashore, and it was not long
before the fire broke through the deck,
destroying the woodwork and equipment
of the vessel. Before the ship was aban
doned by Captain Bryce the hold *vas
nearly filled with water and the miz-en
niast was crippled by the fire and leaning
to j>ort.
SHIP IN BAD CONDITION.
She was in such a condition that she
was abandoned to the underwriters and
Bryce came to San Francisco in Febru
ary, 1301, and the vessel, for account of
the underwriters, was offered at auction
sale in the Merchants' Exchange. Owing
to the almost inaccessible position of
Manga Reva and the uncertain condition
of the Pyrenees when Captain Bryce left
her, the fire at that- time still burning,
the bids were unsatisfactory and were
rejected by the underwriters. Subse
quently Captain Thayer proposed to the
underwriters to visit the ship in person
and make a technical report, giving such
details that would enable prospective buy
ers to base estimates upon the value of
the ship If again offered for sale.
Captain Thayer's offer was not accept
ed by' the underwriters, who expressed, a
desire to sell the ship as she lay without
incurring further expense. The captain
then found a purchaser for the ship, con
tingent on his going to Manga Reva and
floating the ship and bringing her to the
port of San Francisco for repairs.
On the island of Manga Reva there axe
Ella Gienautt, who was married to
Charles Gienautt a little less than a year
ago, is already tired of her venture upon
the sea of matrimony, and has sought the
aid of the divorce court to restore her to
a state of single blessedness.
To Mrs. Gienautt the short voyage
among the billows and^rocks of the mat
rimonial sea. has been a stormy and tem
pestuous one, at least she so states in the
complaint filed by her yesterday.
She alleges that her troubles com
menced shortly after her marriage, while
she was living in Pluxnas County. Her
husband almost broke her heart, she al
leges, by taking from her every cent she
had in the worldâ $20â and spending it
upon himself. This unkind act, she al
leges, was followed by- his efforts to
frighten her to death by doing his best to
make her believe that he was about to
commit suicide. Sbe alleges that he took
a knife, sharpened It on the stovepipe in
her presence, pretended to cut himself in
a vital place and then fell to the floor,
where he rolled about and groaned. -I,'-.',
On January 25, while the couple were
living at S04 Eddy street, he struck her,
and on February 15, she alleges," he took
$10 and her gold watch from her, and only
returned the latter when he saw that an
attack of nervous prostration was im
minent.
Gienautt is an architect in the employ
of August Nordin at 1926 Market street.
Mrs. Gienautt alleges that she was com
pelled to leave her husband on the night
of February 15. While calling upon her
husband's Â«mployer for the purpose of
seeking a small sum to enable her to sub
sist until she procured work Gienautt,
she alleges, drove her out and chased her
up Market street, greatly to her annoy
ance and humiliation. -
Maebelle Bull is suing M. Raymond
Bull, to whom she was married in 1896,

Leale Takes Vacation.
Captain Le&Ie of the ferry steamer- Bay
City is away on a vacation, which he la spend
ing In the country. Shortly before . Captain
Leale went away he lost the diamond-decked
pin presented him by Harbor 10 of the Masters'
and Pilots' Association. The pin is in the
form of a pennant with the figures 15 in tha
center. Vhe pennant stands out from j a flagr-
Btaff, on top of which was Â«et a diamond. The
pin was presented to Captain Leale as a mark
of the local harbor's appreciation of his stew
ardship, of the; organization funds and was
highly prized by the skipper.

Food Than Candy.

Some foods will cure dyspepsia and oth-
er foods will cause it. The safest way to
get well is to use the food that agrees
with the stomach and permits nature to
go along in a thoroughly natural way.
A lady cays: "I have at last found a
truo way to get well and keep well, and
that is by the use of Grape-Nuts Break-
fast Food.
"For six years I suffered with indiges-
tion and palpitation of the heart so that X
could not Bleep nights. I tried a great
many different kinds of medicines and a
lot of different kinds of cereals, but none
cf them helped me, and my stomach
seemed to get worse and worse.
"I became very despondent and was' at
a loss to know what to do. One day I
read in the paper that Grape-Nuts Break-
fast Food would cure indigestion and
build up the body. I wondered if it con-
tained any medicine, but learned t&at it
did not. but that It was only, a food pre-
pared Bo that the stomach could- easily
dlgeÂ«t it- ~ '
"The next, time I went down town I
bought two packages. .This was' on Tues-
day, and Jt was all gone, on Saturday, for
we all lliced It so, much,' so I sent down
and got three more* packages, and from
that time I have been using: Grape-Nuts
steadily and my indigestion has entirely
disappeared.
"Sometimes when my little girl has been
playing extra hstrd after supper she will
climb on xny knee, pat my cheek and.whis-.
per in my ea#. 'Mamma, please give me.
something good.* I say (knowing all the
time). 'What* is good, dear?' She says,
'Grape-Nuta with cream on top,' and there
ic nothing, candy or anything else, that she
enjoys better than this good, wholesome
food. . She eats it for breakfast every
morning, and prefers Grape-Nuts pudding
for dinner. At uigbt she has Grape-Nuts
for her supper, with a' soft-boiled egg,
and she thrives wonderfully on "this kind

There is no doubt that Rampolla is
straining every . nerve to win. In any
event the next Pope will be to a large ex
tent his candidate, and it :s extremely un
likely his choice would be Sarto, an ec
clesiastic who has never warmly sup
ported Rampolla's policy, of intervening in
the political affairs of the Catholic states.
Sarto's ultramontanlsm is not defiant and
combative enough to suit the Papal secre
tary. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦.'
At least three of these states, Portugal
Spain and Austria-Hungary, have had
strong political objections to Rampolla,
although of late he has contrived to
diminish their antagonism. In practice
the Sacred College has usually been given
informally to understand before assem
bling in conclave to select a Pope, that a
certain candidate would be vetoed; and
this aspirant has invariably been excluded
from consideration. .
As matters stand nowâ judging from the
latest expressions of authoritative Cath
olic opinion in Rome, Paris, Berlin, Vien
na and Madridâ Cardinal Rampolla will
secure the succession for himself or will
dictate the choice of the. Sacred College.
The principal danger to his personal as
pirations lies in the fact, not very gene
rally known, that four of the Catholic,
states, France, Spain, Austria-Hungary
and Portugal, possess the power of veto.
That is to say, they have the right to ex
clude one Cardinal from the election a.t
every conclave. .The right can be exer
cised once only and in case of but a single
Cardinal.
The Perosi story is dismissed as a ballon
d'essai. If the latter view be the correct
one, the end sought has been attained, for
great Catholic journals of Italy, France
and Germany have rebuked, gently but
firmly, "those who may have fancied they
had found in the mild patriarch of Venice
a practicable alternative to the ambitious
Papal secretary of state."
LONDON, April 26.â In Roman 4 Catholic
circles in London, Continental gossip as
sociating Cardinal Sarto with the succes
sion to St. Peter's chair is regarded with
but slight " consideration. The Tablet,
which is Cardinal -Vaughan's organ and
edited under his direct supervision, says
all reports, of any public utterances by
Leo respecting his preference in the Pon
tifical succession "are unworthy of those
(Who circulate them or Indicate deplorable
unfamiliarity with the traditions of the
Vatican and the temperament of his Holi
ness." Â¦Â¦'.''.' -.'Â¦"'Â¦

Bank, was called to the witness stand to
day at the examination of Frank C. An

bank, who are charged^ with causing its

directors discovered that the bank was
holding some of Frank C." Andrews', paper
which they had not approved. . Pingree
said he talked the discovery over with
Frank C. Andrews, and told him that if
the bank was going to be robbed he (Pin

One of the "nipper" boys discovered
that one of the batteries had been cut
and a cartridge cap connected and placed
in a stick of dynamite. The dynamite
had been placed between two boxes of
dynamite, letting seventy-five pounds of
the material down to the cap. Had the
explosion occurred the havoc wrought
would have been fearful. No motive can
be ascribed for the plot.
The shaft leading- down to the tunnel
is 160 feet deep. From the bottom of the
-shaft the tunnel runs north and south,
and the men were working at both head

right 'hand a ring will be placed on his
Majesty's fourth finger. Then will come
the actual crowning.
CROWHINGr OF THE KING.
Throughout the country preparations
are rapidly nearing completion for every
large and little city, town or village to
celebrate in its own particular- way.
Thanks,' perhaps -to the King's example,
the poor are not being forgotten. The
residents of Parrington have supplement
ed the royal dinner to 'the poor of that
section by arranging a dinner for 22,000
children resident in that borough, and in
many places members of the aristocracy
are offering to similarly entertain the
poor of the vicinity of their country
places. - ' ' *
The Pope has granted the Catholics of
the British Empire a dispensation from
abstinence on Friday, June 27 (the day
after the coronation), and also on Satur
day, June 28, which is* the vigil of a
saint's day. in order that they may par
ticipate in 'the national rejoicing.
.The form of the coronation ceremonies;
as finally; amended and approved by. thÂ£
King, was. announced to-day. | It consists
of twenty-six distinct sections. The King
and Queen. will enter the great west door
of Westminster Abbey, to which a large
canopied approach is already being erect:
ed. They will be met by the shouts of
the King's scholars of the Westminster
School and by the anthem, "I Was Glad
When They Said Unto Me, 'We Will Go
to the House of the Lord'." Instead of
going direct to their thrones the royal
pair will kneel in private prayer on foot
stools in front of their chairs.
Then the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Most Rev. Frederick Temple; the Lord
High Chancellor, Earl Halsbury; the Lord
Chamberlain, the Marquis of Cholmon
deley; and the Garter King of Arms, Sir
Albert Woods, each in turn, will formally
present the King, the lords carrying the
regalia will then step up, and the Dean
of Westminster, the Very Rev. George
Granville Bradley, . will place the regalia
on the altar. The abbreviated litany and
part of the communion service will fol
low Then the Archbishop will recite -the
Nicene creed and the Bishop of London,
the Right Rev. Arthur Winnlngton Ingra
ham, Â¦will preach a short sermon.
The hotel question, however. Is less en
couraging for the intending visitors. The
managers of the Cecil, Carlton, Savoy
andÂ»Berkeley all said yesterday that they
did not have a single room vacant for
coronation week. Â¦
HOTELS ABE CBOWDED.
To get accurate information on- these
points a | correspondent made a careful
canvass, inquiring at various points
along the route. He ascertained tKat
seats in the best positions in Piccadilly,
the most sought after situations, could
yesterday be had for 8 to 20 guineas,
according to the room. This was for the
first day's procession. For the second
day the prices asked were from 3 to 7
guineas. In Pall .Mall, where the build
ings are mostly clubs and very few win
dows are to le.t, the prices are slightly
higher. For the second day's procession
along the Strand seats cost 4 to 7 guineas.
At St. Paul four huge stands will be
erected and the prices are from 3 to. 7
guineas. On the south side of the river
the best seats cost 5 to 7 guineas.
The newspapers, both here and In
America, are . full of misstatements con
cerning the cost of seats to view the coro
nation processions and as to what the
hotels will charge visitors. Speculators
and those having seats to sell i are giving
the Impression that there is a tremen
dous demand on the part of rich Ameri
cans and other foreigners, who are said
to be paying any pFice asked in order to
see the show. Ridiculous statements as
to the price paid for certain windows or
seats in Piccadilly or elsewnere have been
constantly published.
LONDON, April 26.â Permanent resi
dents of London are suffering from the
efforts being made by the city for I he
coronation. There is scarcely a street
through which the procession will pass
but has been -torn up. " --

O ! ;_ o
MT INSTITUTION FOR THE
treatment of men' a diseases is the
most complete of its kind upon the Pa-
cific Coast. My offices are thoroughly
equipped with everything- that can aid
in the curing or add to the comfort of
my patients. â¢ Everything-, from the
simplest instrument to the most com-
plicated and costly electrical apparatus
is at my command. My suite of treat-
ing rooms is the largest In thÂ« city,
which insures privacy and obviates the
annoyance of waiting. I can truthfully
say that my unequaled success in ef-
fecting permanent cures Is due In part
to the comoleteness of my facilities,
for without these aids the application
of my original and thoroughly scien-
tific methods of treatment would neces-
sarily be less nerfect. I believe that I
fcave Dracticaily attained the limit of
medical science In this particular
branch of practice, and the Inability
of others to duplicate my cures Is con-
clusive evidence of my leadership.

"WeaKncss."
In treating so-called "weakness" I
employ no tonics or stimulants.
"Weakness" In all its phases and In
practically every case- that comes to
me for treatment is merely a symptom
resulting- from a state of chronic In-
flammation existing in the prostate
gland. This Inflammation may be a
lingering result of some contracted dis-
ease or may ha^e been brought on by
early dissipation, etc. In by far the
greater number of cases the general
health of the patient is perfect, there
being- no lack of either physical or ner-
vous energy. No stimulants or tonics
are needed, and if employed would
only result In temporary excitement
of the functions and positive injury to
the tender and already disordered pros-
tate. My treatment is a local one en-
tirely. It removes all Inflammation,
swelling and tenderness from the pros-
tate Kland. establishes normal circu-
lation throughout the parts and re-
stores permanently and completely all
natural functions. By this method
alone ia it oosslble to bring complete
restoration of strength and vigor.

Stricture.
My treatment for stricture la entirely
independent of surgery. A complete
cure Is accomplished without cutting
or dilating. All growths and obstruc-
tions in the passage are dissolved, the
membranes cleansed, and all Irritation
or congestion removed throughout the
crjrans involved.

Specific Blood Poison.
My treatment for Soecifle Blood Poi-
son neutralizes and eliminates the very
last taint of virus from the system,
and all this is accomplished without
the use of dangerous minerals. I af-
ford you a complete and permanent
cure. r

Contracted Disorders.
Every contracted disease Is attended
by grave dangers that nothing less
than a thorough and absolute cure can
remove. To take even the slightest
chance in such cases is to Invite life-
long misery. Men do not realize this
as they should. A partial cure is fol-
lowed by a chronic stage with all its
horrors the same as though the disease II
had not been treated at all. . I post- I j
lively will not dismiss a patient until I]
every possibility of relapse is removed. I
By my system of treatment every pa- 1
tient is soundly cured and made as free I
' from disease taint as he was before the I]
ailment was contracted. gj

Varicocele,
This most prevalent of all - diseases
of men la also the most . neglected,
either through dread of. the harsh
methods of treatment commonly em-
ployed or through ignorance, of the
grave dangers that accompany the dis-
ease. As varicocele interferes directly
with the 'circulation and process of
waste and repair throughout the or-
gans, the necessity of a prompt and
thorough cure cannot be too forcibly
emphasized. I cure varicocele In one
week by an absolutely painless process.
My cures are thorough and absolutely
permanent and are accomplished with-
out the use of knife, ligature or caus-
tic.

Piles.-
Though I have seldom made mention
of tbts distressing ailment in my an-

every day for treatment as a result of 1
recommendations from those I havt I
cured. - I positively cure all cases of II
piles by the use of soothing and heal- I
Ing remedies. I can guarantee a com- 5
plete cure in every Instance. fj

This was displeasing to the farmers and
rtockralsers of the West, who were then,
as now, in close sympathy with the Beef
Trust. Although the Ways and Means
Committee did not go to the extent of re
storing the $10 duty on cattle it declined
to provide an ad valorem duty and im
posed a specific tariff, graded in accord
ance with the value of the cattle. - -
After the enactment of the McKinley
tariff the importation of cattle from Mex
ico stopped altogether. Cattle accumu
lated there until the Wilson tariff went
into effect, and then they were once more
brought across the border, j
' Testimony taken by the committee
showed that many Americans had gone
into Mexico while the war tariff was in
force and had established ranches there
on. high ground- out of the reach of
droughts. They had invested a large
amouht."of capital and were in the habit
of sending their cattle into Kansas and
Nebraska to be fattened for the market.
This fattening process usually required
one or two years, and the point was
brought out in the hearings that it af
forded a market for the grain of .the
States in which it was carried on.
Under the so-fcalled "war tariff" the
duty of 20 per cent ad valorem was;im
posed upon cattle. The McKinley tariff
of 1S90 imposed a specific duty of $10 a
head on cattle more than one year old.
This gave way in the Wilson tariff to an
ad valorem duty of 20 per cent, and the
Ways and Means Committee, at the time
that the hearings were given, In 1897, were
considering a proposal to restore the Mc-
Kinley duty of $10 a head. ' "

BUTTE, .Mont., April 26.â John F.
Forbis, an eminent attorney of this
State, and his law partner, L.' O. Evans,
representing the Amalgamated Copper
Company in the sensational Minnie Healey
mining case, were to-day adjudged in con
tempt of court by Judge E. AV. Harney
of the District Court. They were fined
$500 each and committed to the County
Jail for twenty-four hours. Late to
night, however, Chief Justice Brantly of
the Supreme Court issued . a writ of
habeas corpus and released the two at
torneys on bail of $500 each.
The contempt grew out of the scandal
connected with the trial of the Minnie
Healey case, in which numerous affidavits
were presented in court charging Judge
Harney with the most shocking immoral
ity and corruption in connection with the
case and his decision in favor of F. Au
gustus Heinze and against the Amalga
mated Company.
Forbis and Evans did not prepare or
present the. affidavits, but after Judge
Harney had stricken them from the rec
ords on the ground that they were im
material and contemptuous, Forbis and
Evans were called into the case to make
an effort to have the affidavits \ included
in the records of the case for an appeal
to the Supreme Â¦ Court. Because , they
asked the court to allow the records to
show what had' been stricken out by the
court, Judge Harney adjudged the attor
neys guilty of contempt.
The court's action caused a tremendous
sensation and protest came from scores
of attorneys. The people generally be
came "excited and denounced the cuort.
Violence was even talked of.

SACRAMENTO, April 26.â Charles War
drip, a youth of 19, confesses that he. is
the murderer of Hugh Duffy, and declares
that he prefers to hang for the crime
rather than undergo imprisonment for
life.
"I know I am in for it," said Wardrip
to Sheriff Charles Naylor of Salt Lake,
who, with Detective Max P. Fisher, ar
rived with, the prisoner in this city to-day.
"I know it's all off and that I am going
to swing, but I intend to die game. No
life imprisonment for me. I am going to
face it like a man. I will die game like
my brother did, who was executed at Co
lumbus, Ohio, five years ago."
Chief of Police Sullivan has in his pos-^
session memoranda written by Wardrip
and handed by him to a cellmate at Salt
Lake, in which* he stated that he was in
Seattle and Tacoma during the week in
which the murder of Hugh Duffy wag
cdmmitted in Sacramento. He expected
this cellmate, with the aid of these notes,
to help him establish an alibi. When
asked why he had done this, 'Wardrip said
a man would do anything when he knew
his life was at stake.
One of the most damaging circum
stances against Wardrip was the state*
ment of Dr. A. A. Meyer,. a retired physir
cian, lately arrived from South Africa and
living on the dairy farm of his widowed
sister, Mrs. Hirschman, at Salt Lake.
Wardrip and another man were occupy
ing' the loft of a barn on the place when
Dr. Meyer heard a conversation in which
Wardrip told of having killed a man in
California, in order to save a boy confed
erate. Wardrip says the boy was separ
ated from him on 'the night of the murder
and he has not seen him since. He de-r
elares his only object in shooting Duffy
was to save the boy, who had been seized
hy Duffy, while Wardrip Was still in the
Bartell house, which he and the boy had
already ransacked. ,
Wardrip was released from San Quen
tin in November last after a year's term
for a burglary committed at Madera. He
was born in Kentucky, of Russian par
ents.

Ihiffey Equals Hundred Yard Record
PHILADELPHIA. April 26.,â The world's
cne and two mile relay records were
broken and the world's figures for 100
yards were equaled on Franklin Field
this afternoon in the carnival of relay
races and Held sports. Harvard won the
one-mile championship in the new figures
of 3:21 2-5. Pennsylvania captured the
two-mile championship and clipped one
fifth of a second" from the world's record
of S:05, and Yale took the four-mile relay
championship in slow time. The 100-yard
dash was run in two heats and a final. In
each of his races A. F. Duffey of George
town equaled the world's record of :09 4-5.
The oleomargarine bill, as agreed to by
the House, wa3 laid before the Senate,
but went over until the amendments, as
agreed to, should be printed.
A resolution offered by Proctor of Ver
mont was passed directing the Secretary'
of War to send the Senate the number
of disappearing gun carriages under, con
tract; a list of the bids for the construc
tion of said carriages, the total cost of
the carriages, where they will be mounted
and where it is proposed to mount those
under construction. The resolution was
adopted. ' ' -. .
Jones of Nevada, chairman of the Com
mittee on Contingent Expenses, reported
favorably the resolution of the Committee
on Relations wi%h Cuba providing for an
invest tgation by that committee of; the al
leged control of the Cuban sugar crop and
sugar lands in Cuba. Teller/ of â¢ Colorado',
who had introduced the resolution, said
it was not what he wanted entirely, and
was not what he thought ought to be
passed. He said that he desired to deny
that he tad ever said' that the Colorado
sugar producers were willing to have the
duty taken off' sugar. He made such
Â¦statement in view of such a. remark hav
ing been attributed to him by, a witness
before the Ways and Means Committee.
He would not object to a reduction of the
duty on sugar, he said, if there also was
a proper reduction on other things. .The
resolution was adopted without further
comment. ' ;
WASHINGTON, April .. 26. â In the
Senate to-day - Platt of Connec
ticut Â¦ presented a conference report
on the Chinese exclusion bill, asking
that the Senate disagree to the report
and insist upon a further conference. He
explained that-the only point of difference
between the conferees of the Senate and
House was that the House conferees
asked the Senate conferees to eliminate
from the substitute passed by the Seriate
that portion which provides that the pres
ent Chinese exclusion law j be extended
through the life of the present treaty/and"
remain in force until another treaty shall
have been negotiated. Â¦ . ;; Â¦ 'Â¦
Platt' s motion, that the Senate insisÂ£
upon its amendment and agree to another
conference was adopted. Platt, \ Dillingr
ham and Clay were named as conferee^
on the part of the Senate. f

THE SA1ST FKAKCISCO CA1.L^ SUNDAY, APRIL, 27, 1902. }
PHOENIX. April 26.âAn unusual inci
dent-occurred in the District Court
at Solomonville yesterday, when Judge
Fletcher M. Doane caused to be entered
in the court record an order that none
of the jurors in the Reilly murder case
should ever be:.permitted to sit on a jury
again during his . incumbency on the
bench. The jurors brought in a verdict
of acquittal in a case where the guilt of
the defendant, James Mclntosh, seemed
so apparent that the Judge and the pub
lic were taken by surprise.
Early in the year a traveling photog
rapher from San Francisco named Reilly
entered the Richelieu saloon at Clifton
and began gambling at a crap table pre
sided over by the wife of James Mcln
tosh. A dispute arose over a bet. Mc
lntosh interfered and . "knocked down
Reilly, beating him brutally. As Reilly
lay .helpless on the floor Mclntosh jumped
upon him and stamped him until the vic
tim was carried away unconscious, dying
a day or two later. That no penalty what
ever was inflicted upon the mur.derer by
the jury is considered a public outrage.

STOCKTON, April 26.âStockton is, to

VERDICT, OF ACQUITTAL
â¢ ANGERS ARIZONA JUDGE
It is said here that this proposal will be.
of great benefit to the Dominion Govern
ment Assay Office in Vancouver if it be
carried out in accordance with sugges
tions that have come .-from the West.
The plan suggested-^and this is the one
that in all probability will be adopted by
the Governmentâ is th.it the 5 per cent
will still be qollected 6n gold mined in the
north and the rebate on production at
the Vancouver Assay Office will be in
creased from the present figure to 2% or 3
per cent. Such an arrangement undoubt
edly would be of great advantage to the
business of the Vancouver Assay Office
and there is at present suggested no good
reason why this should not be arranged
by the Government. *:
; VANCOUVER, B. C, April 26.â The Do
minion Government has decided to reduce
the royalty on gold mined in the Yukon
district. The royalty is now 5 per cent.
It has becm decided to reduce it to 3 or
perhaps 2% per cent. It will be collected
as an export tax in the future and there
will be certain exemptions.
Will Be Collected as an Ex
vport Tax and There Will i
; ' : - v Be Exemptions.

Wm, Wood of Bedding, CaLy, who
nearly died from malaria and
was -entirely cured by tdfcing
Here is Mr. Wood's experience #s
written by himself : -
Cal., March 21, 1902.
Halpruner Medical Manufacturing Co., : â¢
28 California street, \
San Francisco, Cal. " *v '.~.v'
GENTLEMEN: I can truthfully say that your remedy is- a
good one for malaria.
As I came from the East to California I was taken with ma-
laria in a short time, and I tried everything and had all the best
doctors in town, but nothing did me any good. I had given up !
in despair, and thought I must surely, die in California, and I
wanted so much to go back to my old home.
One day one of your little booklets was 'thrown on our porch
and my wife read it from beginning to end, and she was so inter-
ested in.it that she wanted to go at once and get me a bottle of
Halpruner's. I did not want it at first, but at last I- thought I
would give it a trial, -so I sent for a bottle and after a few doses
felt a change at once. I began to -get Â¦ better, and have riot had
the chills or fever since commencing its use. ; "
I cannot praise Halpruner's enough for what " it has done
for me.
You may print 'this if you will and I will answer all 'letters in
which is enclosed a 2c stimp for reply, and I can truthfully say
and prove all I have written. God bless your remedy.
: Halpruner's cures malaria and rheumatism by driving out the acid and
poisonin the system through the pores of the skin. An internal dose of* Hal-
pruner's makes one perspire freely, and the perspiration thus caused carries
Â¦"with it the impurities of the disease and gives relief quickly. " .
If you suffer from malaria, rheumatism, chills,. fe,ver, ague, try Halprun-
'er*s. All druggists sell it for 50c and $1.00 a bottleâ the large size contain-
ing three times the quantity of the small bottle. But if your druggist won't
supply you, send $1.00 to the Halpruner Medical M'fg. Co., 28 California st,
and a large bottle will be sent you by pr epaid express. -

Duguid further alleges that on the oc

about the streets he was followed by a
large crowd, which 'greatly humiliated
him and caused him mental, anguish. . .

his neighbors and delivered over to his

chasing him for six blocks and .into. the
arras of a policeman, who placed him un

On the night of April 8, he alleges, Mrs.

CHARLES DUGUID
IS FRIGHTENED
In the cases of Charles Donnelly and
Edward Duncan, convicted of mÂ»rder in
the second degree, for the same crime, a
motion for a two Â¦Weeks';" continuance was
grunted.' It was remarked yesterday as a
singular coincidence- that each of the four
defendants was convicted on a Friday.
' "It Is ' proper for I the court fn passing
upon the motion for a new trial .to state
that the court, has not the slightest doubt
of the guilt of this defendant. This dec
laration. is inspired by the' inpressions
which the" evidence during the trial pro
duced upon the â¢ mind of the < court, zp
enforced by a study of the printed record
of the evidence. If the court -had any
doubt or. even a shadow of doubt it would
not take the view which it does of the
action now. before it. In the argument on
the motion for a new trial it was sug
gested that the â¢ jury must have ; been
moved by passion -and prejudice. In the
view of this court if any different verdict
had been rendered against the defendant
the jury would have. been open to a still
graver ' charge than that suggested.' ' ,

Thomas Moran, who wa$ also convicted
of murder in the first degree for, Rice's
murder, was sentenced by the Judge to
imprisonment for life in Folsom Peniten
tiary, being the penalty fixed by the jury.
Moran took his sentence coolly.
Previous to passing sentence the Judge
denied the motions for a new trial in each
case. In regard to Buckley he said in
part:
"William Buckley, convicted of murder
in the first degree for the murder of
George W. Rice, the non-union machinist,
at Twentieth and Howard streets on the
evening of October 11, was sentenced to
be hanged at San Quentin on Friday,
July 11, by Judge Lawlor yesterday.
Buckley's mother was in court at the
time, and when sentence was pronounced
upon him she threw up her hands, uttered
a moaning cry and collapsed in the chair
in which she was seated. She continued
to wall and moSVi and had to be carried
out of the courtroom to the Judge's cham
bers, where after a time she recovered
her composure, Buckley said nothing
and did not give any indication of emo
tion. He had a dogged, defiant look on
his face.

' The- Sultan of Mindanao is one Man
gigin, but all the Moros do not acknowl
edge his sovereignty. The Philippine
commission which visited Mindanao in
terrogated a datto named Mandi, pro
fessedly friendly to Americans; In regard
to the Lake Moros. He said the Lake
Lanao region was thickly settled and
comparatively well cultivated. In 1S36 tho
Spaniards ' attempted to Invade this ter
ritory. An : expedition went from IHgan
to : Lanao. "A railroad was built from
Illgan to the lake ' and three small gun
boats were. transferred to the inland body
of water. At that time tbe Moros were
indifferently. armed, but they fought vig
orously, firing stones as projectiles. The
Spaniards killed only a few Moros, while
themselves sustaining a , number of caa
ualties. They failed in their efforts to sub
due the natives.
The soldiers have had no . trouble witn
the natives, .but there -would be trouble
if whites entered the country in any con
siderable number, especially with the
Lake Moros. / *
Captain Hagadorn. who has visited tho
lake region,- describes the country as be
ing'exceedingly rich, populous and well
cultivated. â¢ Some gunboats were taken
up and sunk in the lake by the Spaniards.

Gentlemen, ..we have the largest merchant
fleet ever kissed by ocenn breezes and these car
riers of international commerce must be built
of American material, Jn American yards, by
American labor. They are to be manned by
American sailors, fired by American coal, or
more probably oil, and they are to float the
Stars and Stripes. 'â¢ "Whether\this will be ac
complished through' direct aid or by American
patriotism and by American energy, I cannot
eay. Whether this consummation shall be con
tributed to by statesmen or achieved by finan
ciers is Immaterial compared with the impor
tance of the thing itself .. American wealth,
American energy, plus Hawaii, - which is ours;
plus the Philippine -Islands, -which are ours;
plus the- Isthmian canal, which we will surely
construct; plus a merchant marine, which we
will surely build, will transfer the sovereignty
of the Pacific Ocean from the Union Jack to the
Stars and Stripes. â¢ - . . .
be entering upon an equally progressive policy
of external improvement. Not as the crow
flies, but as ships, sail, it is nearer from Liv
erpool to San Francisco, via. Cape Horn, than
from New York to the same port, via the same
southern extremity. : Start two ships of equal
speed from Liverpool going to our Pacific
Coast, one through the Suez Canal and the
other by Cape Horn, and two vessels of the
same weed from 'New York. one. going west
ward and the other eastward, anM both Eng
lish vessels will reach their destination be
fore either of ours. â¢ Cut the isthmian canal
and it Is nearer from New York to Hongkong,
via Nicaragua, than from Liverpool to the
same point via' .the' Suez. - .
It is safe to cay that had none of the great
families â none of the flave-holders â stood for
the Union. Kentucky, Missouri and Maryland
would have neeeded, and if they lied gone with
the South unanimously the Confederacy woulu
have achieved Its independence. This brings
me to the central idea of thiH speech â the main
fact â of which I never think without anger
and resentment, for I believe that justice should
be done, even in- writlnp history, though, the
heavens fall, and it 1* this: Population con
sidered. Kentucky and Missouri sent more sol
<2lers to the Civil War than any other State
and received less credit for it. They were splen
did soldiers, Â£oo. Theodore Roosevelt saj'3 that

were the flneet epecimenK of physical man

The speaker expressed the conviction
It is tcnerally assumed by the wlsacres who
write the histories that in the border States the
old wealthy, prominent slave-holding families
ell 'adhered to the Confederacy, and that only
the poor, the obscure native and the lmmUfranU
frcnVthe North etood by the old flag. This U
& serious mistake. The sreat historic dominant
family connections divided. Prominent people
wore the Confederate gray. Others -Just as
prominent wore the Union blue.

"Beef is high, thanks' be to Providence,
and stock men want to see It stay that
way. Everybody in Montana is glad to
see them make money for the salvation
of the West Long live the 'Big Four.' "
. The beef trust Is opposing \he national
irrigation bill .because the passage of this
bill would mean the breaking. up of the
great cattle ranges. One of the cattle

the same lenient view is not taken at the

that", the war " should ! be . prosecuted - with
the utmost vigor, . but within the . bounds
of humanity. , :
That General Smith's policy accom
plished these results,' It is stated, is shown
by conditions In Samar, where the insur
rectos have practically' all surrendered
and where a condition of comparative
peace prevails. . ._' Â¦ . ;!
It was pointed out that the '.court which
la trying General Smith is composed of
officers who have Issued or obeyed the
very kind of orders ' which the â¢ accused
published and enforced. The department
insists that "war Is hell" and that' the
quickest way to 'bring it to an- end is to
make the enemy as' uncomfortable and
sick of hostilities as possible. â¢
The. effect of the organization of the
court by j the ; President I will be to make

means that the' President will finally de
termine the 'propriety of. General rChaf

As after the. Civil War the nation entered
upon an extensive policy of International " Im
provements, subsidizing so Ions as necessary
transcontinental lines of railway and perma
nently continuing; the subsidizing of rivers and
harbors, so after this later, war we appear to
tereetinji to note that the most pronounced
disciples of State sovereignty complain not. of
this action and utter no other, criticism than
that it should have been commenced earlier.
Note the demand, for national regulation of
railways, of ' express companies, of telegraph
companies, of Insurance and of trusts. Note
the demand Â¦' for uniformity In labor laws, di

trend of events and the trend of thought seem

ANGELS FAIL TO SCORE,
Most of the educated money went In

at one and a sixteenth miles, the conclud
ing number on the card. See waited per
haps a trifle too long with the brown

standpoint. Many society notables
of Oakland viewed the sport from
the clubhouse lawn and verandas.

in front and the . result was never in
doubt, winning almost eastly from Loyal

-with Mr. .Bates in the saddle, was a fair
. third. The Gaffer, well handled by Mr.
, . J>edgrett. showed to advantage the first
â¢. j;art of the race, but failed to stay the
route. A handsome silver cup was pre
"etnted to the winner, Mr. Skinner.

absent-minded and took Julie Streib ' for

KANSAS CITY, April 26.â In the Circuit
Court here to-day it was held that ' Dr.
Leon Rosenwald, aged 28, was not entitled
to the estate of his late partner, Dr.
Charles W. Adams.:: valued at between
$60,000 and $75,000. Adams was an eccen
tric old physician.- When he ' died, aged
65, he left no will or no known heirs. Dr.
Rosenwald brought suit to secure the en
tire estate, contending that Dr. . Adams
had verbally promised him that if; the
(Rosenwald) would become his^ partner
and care for him -in time of sickness ho
should have all his property at his death.
"A half-brother and a half-sister of Dr.
Adams, whose . real name was . Charles
Weisner,' were finally found in California,
and they laid claim . to the estate.. - Al
though to-day's decision does not v estab
llsh the right of the California heirs,' it
brings them' many, steps nearer to the
possession of the estate.

The laborers who were robbed are all
employed on railroad work or were being
temporarily housed and transported in
the boxcars. From the frequency of sim
ilar crime recently the officers believe the
masked men -.were but two of a gang,
traveling from point to point, committing
crimes wherever small gangs of railroad
men are stationed.
In the second car were fifteen Italian,
laborers. Knocking on the door, one of
the men demanded admittance, and, when
his request was complied with, he leaped
Inside, closely (followed by his companion.
The alacrity mlth which the entrance was
effected astonished the labores and when
they realized what the black masks and
revolvers meant they were in no posi
tion to offer resistance. The men were
lined up on one side of the car and or
dered to place their hands above their
heads. While one of the robbers guarded
the victims, the other searched their
pockets and then their baggage, taking
money and Jewelry. Just how much was
obtained by the thieves It Is impossible to
say at this time.
The latest hold-up occurred at Corrine.
Utah. Two masked / men held up seven
teen laborers, robbing " them of their
money and valuables. The two men first
entered a box car in which were two la
borers, and thrusting the muzzles of re
volvers under their noses relieved them
of their money and what valuables they
possessed. Pocketing their plunder the
highwaymen proceeded to another car
and there committed as bold a crime as
has been recorded in this section in many
years.

principal ports of the world. It was in

It was said that much of the trouble
that culminated in the divorce of Trow
brldge and his first wife was due to his
lavish expenditure of money after Mrs.
Trowbridge received her share of the Del
Â£pi fortune. She had $300,000 or $400,000.
$nd the divorce decree recites that Trow
bridge had spent a large portion of the
community property. He pays no ali
mony.
Mr. Trowbridge's second marriage not
only is a eurprise. .but revives interest in
hif first matrimonial affair, which failed.
His Reno bride Is the daughter of a pio
neer miner of El Dorado and is very well
known in the mountain district. She went
to Sacramento In order to gain her own
living. How, when or where Mr. Trow
fcriflge and his bride became acquainted
has not been disclosed.
The former husband's home has been at
Mountain View for some time, -where be
has been studying medicine. Hia first
wife holds a degree as a doctor of medi
cine. She has never practiced.
After the death of Mr.*Delger the Trow
bridges built a beautiful home on Vernou
Heights and entertained. Then there was

and her son going first, followed later by
Mr. Trowbrldge. Husband and wife re
turned separately.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call. '
1118 Broadway, April 26.
Henry O. Trowbrldge, a prominent drug- Â¦
gist of Oakland and Sau Francisco aiui
former husband of Mrs. Lillian Trow- \
bridge, was married last Wednesday at !
Reno to Miss Georgia Shaw of El Dorado, ;
v ho for two years had been a sales- i
woman In Weinstock & Lubin's depart- â¢
merit store at Sacramento. :
The announcement of this second mat- !
rimonial venture of the former society J
leader of this city was a surprise. It
comes three months after Mr. Trow- I
bridge was divorced by his first wife in j
Bar- Francisco on thÂ«i ground of desertion.
The first Mis. Trowbridgc was the daugh
ter of the late Frederick Delgcr, the mil
lionaire capitalist. Her marriage in 1883
was a sreat society affair. The groom ;
was then a mender of the firm of Kirk- j
land & Trowbridge, which subsequently |
sold to the Owl Drug Company, with !
which Mr. Trowbridge is still connected.

, The Oakland Transit Consolidated Street
Car Company to-day announced a general
increase in wages of the men on its sys
tem from 21 cents an hour to 24 cents,
the increase to go into effect on May 1.
This action was voluntary on the part of
the- company. While 'no demands have
been made by the men upon tbe-eorpora
tion, it is ; practically :* certain that with
the success of the men in San Francisco
! similar demands would have been made
i upon the Oakland Transit in this city.
The Oakland Transit- took time by the
forelock, and rather than have any ue
mands or. strikes placed the ; scale of
wages higher than. has ever been paid in
Oakland, and at a -rate, that the Oakland
I company feels is as high as the more lim
ited travel In Oakland I will warrant. As
no demands h"ave been made by the men
and the rumors of demands are quite in
definite and not very certain, it is unlike
ly that there will be any trouble upon the
Oakland lines. The mien in Oakland have
none of the obnoxious rules to. combat
i that caused the original trouble between
Manager Vining and the men in San
Francisco. \ _^
The Amalgamated Association of Street
Railway. Employes, which Is conducting
(the strike in San, Francisco, does not ex
ist in Oakland, though the street car men
on this side of the bay are far better or
ganized than the men in San Francisco
ever "were. For six years, there has been
in Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley a
purely local organization, known as the
Carmen's Social and Benevolent Society,
and this, organization comprises .practi
cally every street car employe on this
side of the bay. It has maintained the
best of â¢ relations between the men" and
the companies. The;' society has been
recognized by the Oakland Transit,
though the men on âÂ¦ the .Telegraph and
San Pablo avenue systems never joined
until those lines fell into the hands of the
Oakland Transit.- The Transit Company
has always assisted the annual ball that
is given. by this organization, so that thft
position in Oakland is very different from
that in San Francisco."
The men say that,. they have, no com-^l
plaint unless it was that of wages, and the
Oakland Transit has forestalled any de
mands, in this line. -Had it not made
these concessions ' the company would
have been compelled to face them within
a very short time. * '. . ,
The Oakland Transit. also announces a
series of summer excursions to be given
the men to Hay wards Park,' at the end of
tho Haywards line. The dates will be an- I
nounced later. The company proposes to
furnish the cars,' music and entertain
ment for the men and their families.
The order announcing the Increase in
pay to tho men reads:
To Motormen and Conductors: One rear ago,
on the first of May, we considered that the
conditions warranted an Increase of wages and
accordingly the present rate was announced.
Since that date we j have been pleased to note
that you have been careful and diligent in the
discharge of your! duties, undisturbed by the
clamor of agitators or the strife of others.
Another. May first, is. now near,' and in appre-.
elation of the, loyal, faithful men who have
operated our cars skillfully and Â¦ conscientious
ly, - we take pleasure In advising you, that on
and after May 1 all motormen and conductors
will be paid at the rate of 24 cents per hour.
Trusting and believing that each and all of
you will take a personal interest in the faith
ful discharge of his duties, to the end that it
may be a pleasant and prosperous year for us
all, and with cordial good wishes for your per
sonal ' success In your respective duties, wo re

Law Clothes Them With
Right to Enforce
Answers.
From County JaiL
Supreme Court Denies Dono
hue's Demand for Release
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 26.
In affirming the decision of Judge Hall
to-day in the case of Peter B. Donohue,
who was committed to jail for contempt
for refusing to answer questions during
the taking of hi3 deposition, the Supremo
Court decides a question that -has been
agitating the legal minds of the Stats
ever since the question of the jurisdiction
cf certain officers of the court was raised
when attempts were made to take the
deposition of G. B. Daniels In the Collins-
Enquirer suit.
The decision, in fact, has an important
meaning for the parties in the Enquirer
suit, for It means that they will have' to
inswer questions now whether they want
to or not, as it lies In the powers of Su
perior Judges, at least, to enforce at
.endance and answers to questions. Tho
Jccision of Chief Justice Beatty of the
Supreme Court says that Judges of the
superior Court exercise the same judicial
powers when taking depositions as they
io when sitting as courts of law. They
.^an subpena witnesses and enforce an
swers to questions under threat of impris
onment for contempt.
Whether the decision means that Court
.Commissioners are clothed with the same
judicial functions as Judges is left an
open question still, as that matter was
not touched upon. In the cases of no
taries public, however, the Supreme Court
has decided that they have merely min
isterial powers, and the decision may ap
ply to the jurisdiction of Court Commis
sioners. It was contended in the Colllns-
Ehquirer suit that the Court Commis
sioner has only ministerial powers.
Donohue's refusal to answer question*
yesterday in deposition before Judge Hall
was according to agreement to test thÂ«
mooted question. Judge Hall sent him
co jail for contempt and his attorneys
went to th4 Supreme Court to get him
out on habeas corpus.
Justice Beatty was the only Justice sit
ting in the case, and he decided, after lis
tening to the arguments of Attorney Bos
ley for the plaintiff and Attorneys Creed
and "Webb for the defense, that Judges
of the Superior Courts have judicial pow
ers while taking a deposition. He then
denied the writ of habeas corpus, thereby
affirming the decision of Judge Hall.
Donohue was released from custody
aftÂ«r spending the night in the County
jail upon promising Judge Hail that he
would answer questions when he appears
co make his deposition next Thursday.

Vast Sum of Money Dne the Cuban
Soldiers Startles the* Presi
dent.
HAVANA. April 26.â Generals Rabl.
Lora, Solsedo and Capote have tried to
obtain from President-elect Palma an as
surance that the Cuban army would bÂ»
paid. Replying to the generals, Senor
Palma said he was disposed to pay the
army, but to do so more resources would
be needed than Cuba now has. He never
suspected, he said, that the list of those
to be paid contained 70,000 names, and the
estimate of the amount due the soldiers â
$80,000,000â frightened him.
"The payment of this enormous sum
would annihilate us. I would have to
lease Cuba to raise this amount," said he.
Senor Palma'a idea was to revise the
lists and to negotiate a loan of $10,0X1,000,
providing for the interest by a sinking
fund as outlined in the constitution. He
expressed regret at the fact that no pro
vision had been made . to pension ths
widows of war heroes, mentioning par
ticularly the widows of Generals Macao
and Marti. He proposed also to dp some
thing for those injured in the war.
Elaborate preparations are being mads
in Havana for the three days' festival at
tending the Inauguration of the new Cu
ban republic.

Mrs L. O. R- Dyer, founder of the or

the opinion that the Native Daughters
could easily arouse sentiment in the
counties tnrough which the road is
marked and induce the different couoty
boards of Supervisors to take an active
part in the matter of restoration and
hold themselves responsible for the con
dition of- the roads- in their respective
counties. She believes, in these days of

prove a gieat attraction for tourists. _

The entertainment committee nas
planned a recention, a ball and a theater
party tor the evenings of the Grand Par

an to which would be the better, a ban
quet after installation on Friday night
or an informal reception, to be followed
on Saturday by an excursion to Mount
Tarr-alpais. It is claimed that if a ban
uuei is decided upon it will be proscrip
tjve as to numbers, and many Jsative
L/aughters are opposed to the idea of any
<Â»vent at which any Native Daughter who
Uiight wxsh to attend might be barred
out. The grand vice president, who is an
ardent supporter tot the Mount Tamalpais
excursion, says Uiat the greatest treat
that could be offered the delegates from
the interior is an opportunity to go to the
summit of the old. mountain and obtain
a panoramic view of ten of the State s
counties. It is claimed that with the del
egates and- guests and all the Native
Daughters who would like to go on that
trip the day would be a delightful one.

AT THE RESORTS.
'â¢Since counsel," continued the Judge,
"has made known the defendant's atti
tude, the court has ascertained what it
really did say at that time in passing on
the sufficiency of the evidence in connec
tion with the motion for a new trial, and
v/hile the language used Is general and
makes no specific reference .to matter,
which forms the basis, of the present
charge of perjury, nevertheless, it Is
brt)2.d enough, to suggest a belief on the
part of the court' that the defendant, with
a rc-ckless disregard of his oath, lied re
peatedly upon the stand. Under the clr
cums.tances, therefore, and so that there
may be no question as to a fair trial, to
which every defendant is entitled, the
court will not try the case."
The Judge announced that the cfe.se had
beÂ«;n transferred .to Judge Cook's court
and was continued till next Saturday,
when It will be set for trial.
The Jutlire sal 1 he had an announcement
to make. Within the' last few days the
defendant's counsel had informed the
court that the defendant was unwilling to
be tried in that department on the charge
of perjury because the court had, in sen
tencing the defendant on, the forgery
charge, made some statements expressive
of Its estimate of the defendant's action
when he appeared as a witness upon thff
stand.
"Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper, alias
Err-fst Moore Chadwick, appeared before
Judge Lawlor yesterday to plead on the
charge of perjury against him, committed
while testifying before the Judge at his
trial on the charge of forgery. .

" Dear Mrs. Pinkham :â I have read with interest your advice to
others so much that I thought I would write to you for I have been
suffering for a long time. This Idid some time ago.'
"Now I can hardly find words to thank you for your wonderful; Vege-

experience^ â her address is Lynn, Mass., and her advice freeâ if
you are sick write her â you 'are foolish if you don't.
"DEitE Mrs. PetkhA-M: â I write this letter for you, to publish for/the

pound has done me a great deal of good. I have taken three bottles and feel
like a new vroman. When I began the use of your medicine I was hardly able
to be up ; could not do half a day's work. I ached from, head to foot,' was

In such cases there is one tried and true remedy. I^ydla E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles. The
following letters prove this. They also prove the value of Mrs. Pink-
ham's advice.
Theyare^ beset with such symptoms as dizziness, faintness, lassi-
tude, excitability, irritability, nervousness, sleeplessness, melancholy,
** all-gone " and " want-to-be-left-alone " feelings, blues, and hopelessness.
Then occur irregularities, suppressed or painful menstruation,
weakness, indigestion, leucorrhoea, general debility, and nervotis pros-
tration.
Men formerly held the positions that women now hold, and while
women's organism is less strong than men's, they are expected to do^the
same work. Their duties compel them to be on their feet from morning
to night, and many of them, in a short tune, contract those distressing
complaints called "female diseases." ' .' . v\

Jackson is said to have an extensive
criminal record, and admits having been
arrested in : nearly * every State In the
Union. He is a known burglar, and the
police claim that he was the most daring
of the thieves who belonged to the gang
that murdered Policeman* Robinson. The
.prisoner, was supposed to have left San
Francisco in company with Goucher, but
could not be induced to say anything of
his companion's' whereabouts.
Jackson told the reporters that he was
a victim of unfortunate circumstances
and had nothing to do with Robinson's
murder. "' He admitted being with the
gang that night, but declared that the
killing of Robinson was entirely unpre
meditated and that he took no part in it.
Jackson is a mulatto, about six feet
tall, with sinister face and stolid manner.
He was arrested at Grants Pass on the
charge of burglary last month, and while
being held a photograph of him was sent
to the San Francisco police department.
It was at once recognized as a likeness of
the man wanted in connection with the
Robinson case. The Oregon authorities
were notified and agreed to surrender the
prisoner. , ' ;
Â¦ Policeman Charles ..Taylor, arrived last
night from Grants Pass, Or., having in
custody Richard Jackson, alias "Tellow,"

being held for the murder of Policeman
Eugene Robinson on the morning of Jan
uary. 21. Four others are now in the City
Prison awaiting trial for the crime, and
the sixth," "Kid" Goucher, is still at large.
Those- in custody are William Kaufman,
alias "St. Louis . Fat"; Frank Woods,
alias "St. Louis Frank" ;W. H. Hender
son ; John Courtney, alias "Leadville
Jimmy," and Jackson, the latest addition
to "murderers' row."- â¢ . -

Captain of Detectives John F. Seymour
submitted to Chief Wittman yesterday
his second annual report of the detective
bureau from April 17, ' 1901, to April 16,
1902.- During two months of the year the
bureau M-as deprived of the services of
nlije ofllcers, who were detailed for other
duty. Ir, the report'it is stated that, not
withstanding this fact,, there, had been
a substantial increase in the work done
by the bureau over the previous year and
most , of the Important v criminal cases
arising dining the year had been success
fully concluded or were now well along
toward a sat'.sfactc-ry ending. The Chiefs
recent recommendation that the, number
of detective sergeants be increased had
his hearty approval, as the number of of
ficers now . doing j detective , duty was
wholly inadequate to the work required
by the bureau. -

The Financier says: , The official statement
of the New York Associated Banks for last
week showed an increase of $3,325,500 in cash
of which $761,600 constated of â¢ specie ana
$2,563,900 legal tenders. This increase of cash
is only $811,200 below that, which was esti
mated from the traceable movements of money
during the week, the estimated sum being
$4,136,500. In the nrevlous week there was a
difference between the estimated and the offi
cial gain of $1,173,900. the latter being $860 100
while the former was $2,034,000. This wide
difference, it was then believed, Indicated that
the statement was made on rising averages
which belief, it now appears, was most likely
correct. Therefore it- would seem that the
bank returns of â¢ last week reflected ! conditions
as regards cash more closely than has been the
case. The cash movement was â¢ well distrib
uted throughout the week,- money coming from
near-by points .in fair amounts each day at
tracted by the opportunities for employment In
the New York market, and It seemed to be evi
dent that the monetary tide had , quite de
cidedly set toward this center, not only from
neighboring cities, but. from all . parts of the
country. The loans were decreased $1 097 300
making $13,820,800 since April 12,. inclusive'
during which period stock transactions were
in large volume. .-: The reduction in loans last
week appears to reflect continued conservatism
on the part. of our banks.. The requirements
of stock commission houses have, however
been largely met with offerings from country
banks, chiefly at the West, who .: have freelv
loaned the balances with their New York cor
respondents: . also that the Stock Exchange
borrowers . have been able to obtain all Â¦ the
money they needed elsewhere than from I the
local banks or trust comnanles. The denosits
were Increased last week $1,772,400. The state
ment Is therefore out of harmony, the gain In
cash less the loss in loans calling ; for an In
crease in "deposits of $2,228,200. The required
reserve was augmented by $443,100 which
amount deducted from the . grain in cash" of
$3,325,600 leave. $2,882,400 as the Increase-nur
plus Â¦ reserve. :*ThlÂ« Item now stands at SO 401 .'
050. against $16,759,775 at the corresponding
date last year. The cash changes by Individ
ual bank* were comparatively email during the
week. Nine Wall-Ftreet institutions showed a
net gain, of $2,200,000, two df this number In
dicated an Increase of. M.100.000 and one a de
crease pf $1,400,000. i. The bunk clearings for
the week were nearly $2,000,000,000, an Increase

Provisions.
In the counties of the eastern section it had
been much too dry, and the prospect of a good
crop of wheat began to diminsh. but on the
18th heavy rain occurred over the eastern tier
of counties, thoroughly soaking the soil. The
amount was from half an Inch to an inch In
various localities. This, with the warm weather
of preceding days, had a very beneficial effect
on the crops, causing the fruit trees to blos
som and germinating early sown spring wheat
Winter wheat was also much improved.
The past week has been more springlike than
the preceding ones, and warm weather with
showers has given a considerable impetus to
vegetation* The nights, however, have been
too cool for very rapid growth, and frosts
have, it is thought, considerably injured peach
and apricot bloom in the eastern counties.
Plums, cherries and pears are in general bloom
in the western section, and it is not beliaved
they have been injured by the frost. Grass and
clover have grown, but very little oat sowing
has been dene in the western section, and not
much potato planting. In the southwest coun
ties wheat is doing fairly well. Hops are com
ing up with strong shoots.

CHICAGO, April 26.â Deficiency of moisture
in Kansas and almost freezing temperatures in
many parts of the wheat belt was enough' to
start wheat upward at a good pace at the
opening. of trade. To augment the strength'
cables were ' firmer , than had been expecled
and receipts were email. . Inasmuch Ts the
shortage in receipts has been apparent for
some time and comparisons have been made
against a jshort crop year, the bears became
discouraged again and shorts covered freely.
Excepting rains, every argument was in favor
of the bulls. Traders were of the opinion that
It takes something more than a rain or two to
I make a harvest. After the initial upward Im
pulse, trade was quiet for a time, prices fluc
tuating weakly. Concerning Kansas, Brad
street's had a special report aaying a three
fourths yield at the best and sixty per cent
probable was to be expected. Frosts were pre
dicted in many Western States. Prices worked
up. trade became more active and the greater
part of yesterday's loss was regained. July

Brokers in corn reported the slightest trade

Bank" Clearings.
Local bank clearings during the past week
were $22,470,278. against 521.102.C67 during the
same week last year.
strong strategic position and available for ad
vantageous absorption by the larger railway
systems, as well as the transfer of control of
Louisville and Nashville, are evidences of the
continued 'conviction of the steady tendency to-'
ward consolidation in the railroad world. The
money market has attracted little attention, as
the easy terms offered no check to the specula
tion. There was undoubtetdly heavy liquidation
during the early part of the week in the stock
market. But the large financial projects in
view offer no -ground for a supposition of any
important reduction in the volume of credits.
In fact, there has been a large expansion of our
foreign obligations, as shown by the supply of
bankers' exchange bills in the market against
sterling loans. In eplte of this the course of
exchange has been upward, and gold exports
are considered probable again. The present
extraordinary accumulation in banking reserves
in France is a subject of wonder in the finan
cial world. The conjecture that a large loan
to Russia was in contemplation has been over
thrown by the authoritative statement that the
Russian loan floated 'in Germany was with the
etipulation that no further Russian loan would
be offered within a . year. The French accumu
lation is now supposed to be simply due to a
prevalent spirit of distrust by investors, due to
heavy losses in Russian and other industrials.
It is expected that a satisfactory outcome of
to-morrow's elections in France may lead to
some outflow of French capital into the chan
nels of investment. Some tentative steps were
taken toward securing the admission of Ameri
can securities to the Paris Bourse, or toward
the removal of obstacles to the admission of
foreign securities there, to which importance is
attached. Meantime American capitalists are
availing themselves of the abundant resource?
of the French money market in the carrying
out of syndicate projects and the London mar
ket is indebted to Paris on a scale probably
unprecedented.
Speculative and convertible bonds have been'
very active, moving in sympathy with stocks.
United States 2s advanced % per cent over
the closing call of last week. â¢
In wheat and the reports of rain in the South
west gave . hope of relief from the threatening
conditions.' It is notorious that the leading
speculative Interest in the stock market is very
active also in the grain markets and for this
reason much manipulation was evident in both
markets and current rumors were much given
to exaggeration. For instance reports in cir
culation that the coming corn crop was serious
ly threatened are scarcely warranted at a time
when the seed is not even in the ground. The
influence of last year's corn shortage is too ob
vious in the country's domestic and foreign
traffic not to make the outcome of the coming
crop one of paramount importance. During the
current year the corn shortage has not mate-,
rially affected the merchandise movement to'
the corn region, las the people there were In a
prosperous condition from several good previous
years. As is always the case the shortage in
corn led to large marketing of livestock, so
that the railroad traffic was well maintained.
But another corn crop failure could not but
materially affect the earning power of rail
roads. After coming through the winter in
only moderate condition, the winter wheat crop
has undoubtedly suffered much deterioration
during the past week. Notwithstanding the
strong influence of the grain situation, it is ob
vious that strong and aggressive speculative
forces are still active in the stock market, and
they have been alert in shifting from one point
to another in developing strong points. Confi
dence in the general railroad situation is fos
tered by the general high level of earnings re
ported and by such special exhibits as the an
nual report of Lake Shore, with its great sur
plus earnings over extraordinary expenditures
out of earnings for betterments. The details
of the great steamship merger are accepted as
evidence of progress toward the strengthening
and consolidation of the transportation facili
ties, both domestic ' and International, of the
country. The working out of the community
of interest in the anthracite carriers is also in
evidence and some of the weak's buying of the
Readings had admittedly been in the interest
of the great trunk line systems in furtherance
of the policy of division of control of that traf
fic among them. Lake Shore's report of the ac
quisition (rf a large block of Lehlgh Valley is
evidence of the tsame tendency. On the other
hand there was a rumor of the legal obstacles
which may be Interposed for merger projects in
the decision of the Supreme Court to allow the
State of Washington to file suit against the
parties to the Northern Securities Company.
The force is seen of the comment by one of the
principals that the consolidation of ownership
in the Northwest is assured, whatever may be
the. decision of the Supreme Court on the pres
ent plan of holding the properties. But the
fact remains that important financial results
depend upon the success of the present plan of
holding of these companies, and the question of
its validity must remain a weight on the secur
ities market until it is settled. The activity

were too high for shipping and the market waa
dull all around. Lemons moved slowly and
supplies were excessive. Two cars Of Bananas
were received from New Orleans, but being
green were not placed on the market. Supplies
of ripe stock were limited and prices were
unchanged. The Panama steamer brought up
441 boxes of Mexican Limes. â¢ Â¦ ' Â¦ . - ' .
Offerings. of Strawberries were more liberal
than,- on 'the previous day. Longworths. from
Palo 'Alto were generally In fair condition and
sold easily at -full prices, but the Bouldin
Island' berries were "chiefly of poor quality, and
these sold at the .bottom price. Mallndas in
chests were green and muddy, Â¦ showing the
effects of the recent rain and cold weather.
Receipts were 84 chests Longworths. 24 chests
and 53 crates Malindas.

A RUPTURE truss with steel springs has been
used for 100 years without change; few cure*
have been made with 'such trusses; is it not
time for a change? Hunter's Lever RupturÂ«
Holder has revolutionized the antiquated
truss and has made it possible to make a
cure in 90 days. The holder is worn night
and day without torturing; a continuous
pressure is maintained during the granula-
tion and growth of the tissue covering the
breach; would a wound on the body heal If a
hard pad was bound on It? Never. Has it
not the same effect on a rupture?

In rendering his decision the Judge said,
after j referring j to the question Â¦ of juris
diction, that the most perplexing 1 Â¦ feature
of 7 the case was to find the true facts
from the mass of contradictory testimony
produced at, the trial. The testimony was
grossly, exaggerated and much bitterness
and feeling had: been brought into ; the
case unnecessarily, o The question as to
whether or not the defendant was main
taining a nuisance was more in the nature
of a civil action,, and;: in finding the de
fendant guilty- he would- say that no
, stigma > was attached to, a conviction in
the case. - The sanitarium, he found from
the evidence, was conducted in as orderly
a manner Â¦ as a place of that character
could be conducted,' and he did not be
lieve'that the defendant or her employes
mistreated ' or ' abused ; their patients and
that the - institution was conducted in a
proper Â» manner. . Â¦ ; 
"However,". said/ the ; Judge , in ' conclu
sion, - '.'I find , that ' noises have emanated
from 1 the sanitarium from time to time;
that these noises have disturbed : a large
portion of the community, and. I ; there
fore find that the sanitarium a3 located
at' 1815 Sutter street 'is a public; nuisance."
,' Judge Fritz rendered his decision yes
terday in the case of Mrs. Reeves Atkin
son, charged with maintaining a nuisance
in the shape of a private sanitarium at
1815 Sutter street He convicted her on
the charge and ordered her to appear for
sentence next Saturday,' when notice ot
appeal'will be given. : ', Â¦' Â¦.

Ex-Parte Order for Payment of Ali-
xnony Is Held, to Be
:. ; Invalid. - -
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that an ex-parte order for the payment of
alimony Js void If , the court does - not -at
the time of the issuance of the order
have jurisdiction over the Defendant. TKe
matter has been the subject of many legal
disputes, but has never before been defi
nitely settled. . Â¦'Â¦Â¦',,â¢Â¦
Alice T.- Baker of Sacramento brought
"suit against her husband. Rock Baker, for
a divorce on the ground of cruelty.
Pending a. settlement of the case, t^e de
fendant jvas ordered by the court to pay
his wife $300 as counsel fees and alimony.
The court did not at the time have juris
diction over Baker and on the advice of
his attorneys he refused to make the pay
ment. He was cited for contempt and
his claims of justification were not al
lowed. . _\ .
The Supreme Court holds that Baker
was right in his contention and that he
will not have to obey the order of the
lower court. Â¦ â¢

The circus was a financial success, thÂ«
Elks realizing a large sum for their new
building fund.
â¢ In the big tent the best of good humor
prevailed, In spite of the fact that the
peanut butchers and lemonade venders
short-changed everybody and took every
cent that came in sight, with no | com
punctions of conscience. The performance
'was for the most part a burlesque. The
clowns were nearly all local men. " Several
very good legitimate turns were given,
howeverâ enough so that the audience
was satisfied that it had really seen a
cfrcus. The afternoon performance was
followed by a concert.
' Deputy District Attorney Church was
the principal attraction in the sideshow,
giving an exhibition of ventriloquial feats.
The show commenced this morning with
a street parade, in which were all of the
usual features, from the clown and the
donkey to â¢ the steam calliope. "Well
known citizens of Fresno were out in
clown suits and ballet dresses and dignity
was thrown to the winds. The principal
object of the day was funmaking:.
FRESNO, April 26.â The Elks' circus in
this city to-day was in every way a pro
nounced success. About 4000 persons at
tended in the afternoon and almost as
many in the evening, arid all were satis
fied with the funHhey had.

The largest deal In oil lands of late Is
that made by the Santa Fe In the Kern
River field. The holdings of the Petro
leum Development Company, which have
been acquired, amount to about 3500
acres In the Kern River field. The un
derstanding is that the actual cash price
to be paid In is .$1,270,000. Fully one-third
of the entire lands Involved is reported
to be well proven territory. The output
of the Petroleum Development Company
i& estimated at 30,000 barrels per month,
jsiilh the possibility of increase to 50,000
barrels per month.
According to the Los Angeles Herald
two-thirds of the purchase price will go
to E. L. Doheny. The remainder will go
to other stockholders, among whom W. A.
Bissell, A. B. Butler and H.-.M. Mclntosh
are prominent. The company was organ
ized in the summer of 1899 with capital
etock amounting to $125,000, of which
$100,000 was paid in. The payments as
profits and surplus have amounted to
nearly half a million dollars, so that the
proposition has been a good one for those
more largely concerned. The Herald gives
the following particulars:
EAILEOAD MAKES SAVING.
It Is understood that the actual cash price
to be paid Is $1,^70,000, the basis of calcula
tion being at the rate of $11 per share, and
the revenue conceded to the sellers to thÂ«
moment of transfer will bring the purchase
figure to about fl.418,000. A close t-xperting
of the property to be taken over has deter
mined that not less than one-third of the entire
holdings is proved oil bearing territory, and
while the output of the Petroleum Develop
ment Company has exceeded 30,000 barrels a
month, this amount can easily be enlarged to
60,000 barrels. The former amount was all
that was required to meet the demands of the
company's flve-year contract with the Santj.
Fe entered into a. little over two years ago.
Inasmuch as Kern River oil can be produced
tor 10 cents a barrel the price of 96 cents
paid under the contract by the Santa Fe left
a handsome margin of profit to the company
and President Ripley was induced to take over
the property because of this contract providing
that the Santa Fe Railroad Company should
take the company's entire production. At the
price to be paid it is estimated that the cor
poration will have recovered three-quarters of
the expenditure by the time the five year con
tract at 98 cents will have expired.
The proven territory of the Midway dis
trict has been widened by the strike of
the Barton company on section 25, 32-23 to
the extent of at least a quarter of a mile.
The extent of the Barton strike is. not
definitely known.
Drilling has been resumed upon several
of the properties of the Associated Oil
Company. Oh section 5 of the Kern River
field a new headquarters has been estab
lished and there will be a supply camp.
W. L. Fullerton tells the L.OS Angeles
Times that there is a good market for
oil properties in the Fullerton district.
The Times says that considerable prop
erty has changed hands recently In the
Los Angeles field and there are rumors of
deals pending.
â¢ C. L. Arques has written a handbook
on fuel which Cubery & Co. have pub
lished. Gradually the oil industry is ac
cumulating a large literature of its own,
all devoted to Its development. An Inter
esting statement made by Mr. Arques is
that power can be produced in the terri
tory adjacent to San Francisco bay by
crude oil at the present price at 40 per
cent less than the cost of the " trans
mitted electrical- current from the Sierra
Nevada mountains. "As we move further
Inland on the line of electrical transmis
sion freights on fuel oil increase and the
cost of electrical transmission decreases,
fcence the saving effected by crude oil
Cots not bear such a large ratio."
jonmro the combine.
Two more strong oil companies have
joined the Associate/i Oil Company, the
Giant and California Standard at Mc-
Klttrick. These companies have been
large producers. Concerning the steady
drift of companies to the combine the
Esikersfield Calif ornian says:
As the association increases In size and
strength the attraction that it offers in join
ing it becomes the greater, success begetting
success, and there is little doubt â¢ that the
process of growth is accelerating and will
reach such a speed finally that practically the
whole of the productive lands of the county
will be included among Its assets, being drawn
% Into the whirl by the force of gravitation.

*The crookedest railroad in the world

mit of Mount Tamalpais can therefore
be accommodated on the regular summer
schedule.
On Sundays and legal holidays this will
provide for six round trips and on regu
lar week days three.
The Mount Tamalpais scenic route is be
coming famous the world over as one of
the great trips for beauty of land and sea.

Significant, of the practical spirit of the

Placer County's Gold.
Â¦ In a bulletin Issued by the State Mining
Bureau concerning Placer County are the
following interesting statements concern
ing its resources in gold:
Placer County is the. center of drift mining
in California. A conservative- estimate of the
ancient river channels remaining unworked
which parallel each - other and cross and re
cross the* eastern .portion of the county places
their aggregate length at over 200 miles.
The drift and hydraulic workings of the For
est Hill, Iowa Hill and Dutch Flat divides have
produced more than ?G8,000,000 in gold. The
Dardanelles, Todds Valley, Yankee Jim's, May
flower, Paragon, Weske, Red Point, Mountain
Gate. Morning Star. Big Dipper. Hidden Treas
ure and other gravel mines have produced mil
lions In bullion and - are still being profitably
worked. â¢â¢..-,,
The development of quartz in Placer County
has not kept pace with the gravel mining. The
surface of the county from the lower plains
in the western. portion to the summit of the,
Sierra is traversed by innumerable veins and
ledges of gold-bearing quartz. The product of
the quartz mines has aggregated several mil
lions of dollars, nearly all of which has been'
taken from pay-chutes near the surface. .These
districts now offer good inducements for capi
tal with the prevailing improved methods of
mining. Â¦ ~-
The deepest quartz mining operations In the
county are carried on by the Pioneer Company
near Towle. where they have reached a total
depth of 1250 feet. â¢ Â» . . .
The Ophir district Is thickly ribbed . with
quarts veins. With the exception of the Crater.
Gold Blossom, Hathaway and Three Stars
mines no deep mining has been done In this
district, which has a record of over $2,000,000.
Five new quartz stamp mills were erected dur
ing 1B01. .They were the Three Stars at Ophir,
Washington at Forest Hill. Bhady Run near
Towle, Rawhide on Texas Ridge and the newly
Installed mill at the Central Mine near Da
mascus. ..'.'-. : . .-.-. Â¦ .. ' Â¦
Water Is plentiful, timber abundant, lumber
Is cheap and the quartz . and gravel mines of
the county are easily accessible. - Â« ' -

the growth of the city's population, the
need for repairs to many schoolhouses
and the lack of accommodations for a
large number of pupils who desire to at

HIDDEN TREiSM
$30,000 IS LOCATED BY ISMAR, THE WONDERFUL EGYPTIAN SEERESS
Mr. James R. Hammond, a rancher of Santa. Barbara County, visited San Fran-
cisco only a few weeks since, and seeing a newspaper, account of Ismar's wonder-
ful clairvoyant gift, called upon her, .more out of Idle" curiosity than otherwise."
She astonished him with the information that .there, was 'buried treasure on his
ranch to the extent of many thousands of dollars.* Mr./ Hammond was surprised
at first, but coon became Incredulous, and upon returning to his family related -er
words as a humorous incident of his visit to San Franciscol His family took the
matter more seriously, however. His eldest son, .'.Charles,, was so impressed by
the statement that he ., made . many searches v> for . the v burled treas-
ure, but to no purpose. At last/ after a week or , more of : futile effort, he con-
trived to come to* San Francisco on an ostensible business. trip. In reality he came
to consult with the wonderful, woman whose, words; had so wrought upon his mind.
She reiterated to him the statement she,had made to his father, but located the
treasure at the foot of a large sycamore tree near the center- of his father's ranch.
Anxiously he returned home /and without any difficulty, succeeded In finding the
right spot. Ismar's words were absolutely true In every respect. Â±ie took $30,033
out of an old iron box burled four feet under "ground." ~ Nearly everybody in' the
neighborhood has been digging for hidden treasure's. "ever, since. â¢.'Â¦ '
Thus It Is proven once more^hat the secrets: of -bygone, times,- as- well, as the
i secrets of nature, yield readilyto the psychic powers: of Isnuuy the: marvelous
t seer. In everything pertaining to human welfare,; in love, - marriage, business,
\ mining, speculating or adventure, her. advice is "equally valuable and accurate. In
locating of physical ailments she. has no eaual. '.What she .has -done for
others she can do for you. Her readings by mail are as< satisfactory as. those in
person.' Send date and year of birth. Three questions answered, $1.00. Full life read-
