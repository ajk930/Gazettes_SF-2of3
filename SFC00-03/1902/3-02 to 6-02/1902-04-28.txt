deal indicate that the Atchison, Topeka

St. Louis, Ka'neas City and Colorado line,
which was owned by ex-Governor D. . R.
Francis and John Scullln, both of St.

valuable World's Fair sites and give St

The duration of the agreement is limit
ed to twenty years, but either may ter

German lines, which in turn bind them
selves not to increase their present traffic
from England to the United States be-'
yond a certain fixed point. Many other
clauses in the agreement aim at prevent
ing competition between the syndicate)
and the German lines. Neither may ac
quire shares in another, but they are to
mutually support each other, by charter
ing steamers and otherwise, in fighting
competing third parties. -^_
PROVIDES FOB ARBITRATION.
. A committee is to be formed, consisting;
of two representatives of the syndicate
and two representatives of the German
lines, for the . settlement of all questions
concerning their mutual interests. Thia
committee will have no executive- power,
and any differences in construing thÂ«
clauses of the agreement must ba sub
mitted to arbitration. Vv';,;

terms of the agreement between the Ger
man steamship iines and the Morgan
Anglo-American Steamship Syndicate, de
clares "that the birthright of British ship
ping seems to have been sold for some
thing very like a' mess of pottage.
GREAT BBITAIirS PERIL.
"The Germans," says the Daily Mail,
"have made a good bargain, because thÂ«
German Government was wide awake,
whilst the British Government ignored
warnings and laughed at threatened peril.
"It is high time." the article concludes,
"that both the nation and the Govern
ment awoke to their peril." \ '\t

ment of the terms of the agreement be

LONDON", April 28.â The Dally Express,
which declared that every Canadian
steamship line except the Braver line ha*
now joined in an agreement to raise saloon
fares for transportation across the At
lantic, publishes an interview thi3 mom
ing . with Sir . Charles Tupper, former
Canadian High Commissioner in London,
in which he advocates, in the event of ths-
Canadian Pacific Railroad passing to tha
Morgan interests, that retaliatory meas
ures be taken by taxing ; American im
ports, and that special legislation be
adopted to prevent injury to Canadian in
terests. . - .-
Bayly then accepted an invitation to be
a euefct on a yacht which kept close to
ti>e .-,efejpÂ» a.t Newport during -the' war
rames and was able to observe every
move of the American chips.
The original offense alleged against
Bayly grew out of his curiosity in con
nection with the â¢war practice ! of the
North Atlantic squadron at Newport last
summer. Bayly, it is understood^ applied
to the Navy Department for permission
to witness the exercises, but the request
was refused, it being deemed Inadvisable
to have any foreign Government ac
quainted with the manner in which the
exercises were conducted.
Bayly may be recalled at once, but the
United States Government may consent
to his remaining here for a short time.
About three months ago it was said
that Bayly would be recalled, but that he
â¢would be permitted to remain here a. little
Â¦while so as not to make his humiliation
too great and to let comment with regard
to his actions die out. He probably would
have left this country shortly if it had
not been for the revival of the story by
a statement made in the House of Com
mons by Viscount Cranborne that no
ccmplaint against Bayly had been made
to Lord Pauncefote, the British Embas
cafior here, and that Pauncefote had been
Informed that the allegations against the
naval attache were groundless.
"WASHINGTON, April 27:â Captain Lew-
Is Bayly, naval attache of the British em
baEEy at the national capital, will be re
called by his Government, without preju
dice to his character or standing, for
Â¦what might properly be termed perni
cious activity In obtaining information
concerning the United States. This
course is considered the easiest one to
dispose of the notoriety into which he has
been drawn by his overzealousness in
gathering military information.

in the island of Luzon where there was

at an end. and the revolutionary

"The stories of cruelty to the natlvel
have been largely exaggerated. Therti
have been, no doubt, some individual
cases of cruelty, as there have been in
all wars. The Filipinos have been treat

humanity and magnanimity, which they
have attributed to weakness on the part
of Americans. The Filipinos have nat

"Whenever natives warÂ© rounded up
and they refused to divulge information
they were known to possess they- were
formed in line. When they persisted in
declining to repent and confess they were
told that the rules of warfare were rigid
and that they must die.
"Then they had to draw lots and the
r.atlve who drew the black ball was taken
out into the tall grass and told to prepare
for death. The soldiers were drawn up in
a regular squad, with their guns pointing
at the victim, and at his feet in the tall
grass there was a soldier who lay flat on
his face, so that he was not seen.
"The order to fire was given, the sol
diers shot over the head of the native and
at the same instant the hidden soldier
pulled at his legs and down he tumbled.
It impressed the natives, for they thought
that the man was shot. They didn't know
that he was unhurt. After three or four
sacrifices had been made in this manner
the natives generally fell, on their knees
and told all they knew.

knew of, but it was just as effective as
the 'water cure' Is said to have been "

man the "water cure" wa3 " unknown
when he left the Philippines, but an ef
ficient substitute had been found in an
other process, known as the "grass cure."
"It was simple, yet effective," he said
in explanation. "We had - to have some
means of forcing: the natives to confes

what was known in the islands as the
'grass-cure.* I never heard of the 'water

Seven months after the treatment was
inaugurated the patient was practically

engagement at the Columbia with their
greatest success "When We Were Twen

favor with the theater-going public.
Since that time Mr. Goodwin and Miss
Elliott have made one of the successes
cf last season with the play in London,
presenting the rather novel feature cf a
London furor over an English play
given by American Â£Lci;rs. Miss Elliott's
charming personation of the pretty Phyl
lis Is remembered with utmost pleasure.
She is radiantly handsome, and brings
now to the part an added two years' ex
perience, which, with its Initial attrac

charming things seen of late on the lo

the two players are excellently sup

This week's Mil at the Orpheum Is ex

programme presented last week there

eight beautiful young ladies, was as pop

eongs, accompanied by ragtime steps the
high kicking march and rope skipping
dance brought forth well-merited ap
plause. Milton and Dollie Nobles ap
peared to xuivantape in - a brand new
sketch entitled "At Bilgeville Junction."
Knight Brothers, singing and talking
comedians, who held over from last week,
presented a new turn, which went well
Â¦with the audience. Wilton Brothers,
triple horizontal bar experts, do some
hair-raising stunts which are mixed with
enough comedy to make their act enjoy

formance a remarkable example of Air.
Jselll's versatility. Miss Chapman is an
other who surprises in her role of Mrs.
Starbuck, the good-hearted but rather

recognize Mr. Neill's handsome leading

Read's Dew Tennessee "character drama."
It does not matter at all when you look
In, for the plot of "The Starbucks" is
only a minor consideration. Read calls
it a "character drama," and that is as
good a name as any, the interest center
ing in a portrayal of a number of more
or less picturesque Tennessee types.
What plot there is concerns itself with
the arrest of an old Tennessean, Jasper
Btarbuck, for "moonshinlng" by an
hereditary enemy, who has been refused
by Starbuck'g daughter, and it is just suf
ncient to hold the play together. But the
characters are sketched in with sure and
sympathetic hand and are mostly well
worth the sketching. The author has
caught the characteristic tang of pas
toral life in the Tennessean hills, and, if
given to an almost Dickens-like diffusive
ness of description, yet contrives with it
to infuse the same realism of atmos
phere. The lines are delightfully humor
ous in places, their dry drollery given
with point and full appreciation, by Mr.
Xeill and his confreres. Outside of this
the play lacks the dramatic element, and
yet with his material the author should
easily have made a stirring drama out of

United States trade with Eucador shows
a gratifying increase, due to purchases
for the Guayaquil-Quito Railroad, better
and quicker communication, lower freight

THE London Chronicle of April 16
contains a review of the biography
of Rear Admiral _ J. A. Wlnslow,
United States navy, who was cap
tain of the Kearsarge in the mem
orable fight off Cherbourg with the Con
federate cruiser Alabama. The war of
secession and the part which Great Bri
tain took during its progress, Is naturally,
even after thirty-eight years, a subject
which . Englishmen are incapable of dis
cussing without some show of . chagrin,
and especially the fact that England had
to pay $15,000,000 damages to this country
for the destruction wrought By Confeder
ate cruisers fitted out in British pprts.
The Chronicle's comments are correct in
the main, but it is grossly mistaken in the
following statement:. .
"It ! Is still a fact that the American
navy is largely recruited from bluejack
ets who desert from our North American
and Pacific squadrons. The best shot on
the Iowa at the battle of Santiago was a
deserter from the British flagship at Es
quimau."- The European press, and not
ably the British, indulged in similar flings
at the American navy just uefore the
late war with Spain, stating that the
crews of Yankee ships-of-war were al
most all foreigners. It. is a 'tradition dat
ing from the first sea fight in America, In
June, 1772, and "has no other rational ex
planation than that of "the wish being
father to the thought." A condensed re
sume of 'the latest report on the subject
of crews of American war vessels, made
by the Bureau of Navigation, shows that
there were. 18,825 enlisted men and boys
in the navy on July 1, 1901, of which
13,472, or 73 per cent,- were native 'born;
2824, or 15 per cent, were naturalized cit
izens; 1129, . or â¢ 6 per cent, had declared
their, intentions to become . citizens, and
only 1130, or^ 6 per cent, were aliens. Of
the latter, practically the entire lot were
Chinese and Japanese hired as servants
or "boys." Not less than 83 per cent, or
15.624 out of 18,825 Â¦ were citizens of the
United States, which fact the London
Chronicle and other European , papers
will note and "please copy." .

The British naval engineers have good
cause to complain of the niggardly pay
which they receive. The great majority
is paid less - than in* the French' navy.
Engineers â¢ in- the British - navy-"' receive
from $910 to $1095 yearly, â¢ against $1150 to
$1300 In :- the * French - navy; and assistant
engineers' salaries range from $545 to $630
in the English navy, against $870 to $1125
In the French. The salaries of higher
grade engineer officers In the British navy
are considerably higher than in any other
navy, excepting that of the United States,
but the officers upon whom the responsi
bility of proper care and work of the ma
chinery rests are paid. much less than
similar officers in any other service. The
pay of a chief machinist In the United
States navy, rated as a petty officer, is
JS40 a year, and the warrant machinists
receive $1200, which is increased in peri
ods of three years, until after twelve
years' service it amounts to $1800 yearly.
In the Greek navy ship engineers receive
$1000 per annum.
One of the five submarine boats built
by Vickers at Barrow for the British has

They are identical in all particulars with

the plans and right to build were purchaB

Holland. Last" November the Fulton was
successfully tried under unusually severe
conditions, and the British boat was test
on on April 6, with similar favorable re
sults. It is to be noted in this connection
that while six boats of this type were
contracted for by American builders oh
August 25, 1900. to be completed by April
and July 1901, none of them has been
completed, while Vickers, at Barrow,
have practically filled their contract and

Some Statistics Concerning the Fighting Men on the Yankee Warships That May Enlighten
the Editor of the London Chronicle.
WHEN that clever romancer, Captain
Christmas, devised his wonderful story
about the negotiations for the purchase of
the Danish West Indies he doubtless had no further
thought than that of selling it {o a yellow journal.
Afterward he entertained the idea that he could
make political capital out of it and work up a huge
sensation in this country. He fourd in Mr. Richard
son, the Democratic leader in Congress, a willing
assistant in his scheme. Richardson had been all
winter hunting for Democratic campaign material
for use in the fall, and he was quite ready to make
use of anything of the kind that Christmas might
offer him.
The scheme failed. Neither Congress nor the
country would take Christmas seriously, and it
looked as if the romancer would miss making a,sen
sation of any kind. However, he was to have bet
ter luck. The sensation that did not appear here
broke out in Denmark. We are told that the scene
in the Danish Landsthing on the occasion of the de
bate upon the sale of the islands was something un
precedented in that country. The dispatches say the
"session was the most sensational on record."
Twice the lie was passed, and other charges were
flung back and forth between the angry disputants
until it looked as if there was going to be a Tillman-
McLaurintime on the' floor.
Probably a sillier story than that of Christmas was
never, told with the. intention of. getting contem
poraries to believe it, and yet it was a most interest
ing tale. When investigated by Richardson it. was
found to be almost absolutely without foundation
of any kind. Every important statement made by
Christmas was promptly contradicted and refuted
by first-class testimony. The only claim of the
author that has been accepted by even the credulous
is that he was swindled by somebody. It seems to
be agreed that so good a story-teller cannot be a
good business man, and is therefore quite likely to
have bought somebody's gold brick. Mr. Richard
son will riot use the story as campaign ammunition.
It is only in Dcnmarkthat it will live as a tradition
and find men willing to fight over it. Even. there,
however, it will no longer disturb- intelligent men. ,

FOREIGNERS IN UNCLE SAM'S NAVY NOT SO NUMEROUS
AS ALLEGED BY THE UNINFORMED PRESS OF ENGLAND
Santa Clara News (Ind.):
Governor Gage bid high for the Santa Clara
County delegation, and paid the price in appoint
ing Mackenzie, but it looks as if he would fail to
receive the goods. Appearances indicate the
election of "Worswlck as Mayor of San Jose.
In this event there will not be a solid delega
tion for Gage from Santa Clara County, as has
been promised, and Mackenzie's uplift 'will be
Gage's downfall. No official acts of a Gov
ernor have roused the Indignation of the peo
ple of Santa Clara County to such a degree
as have the placing of Mackenzie and the dis
placement of Dr. A. E. Osborne of Santa Clara
from the management of the Home for Feeble
Minded at Glen Ellen.
Woodland Democrat (Dem.):
One of the most pernicious pieces of legisla
tion of the last Legislature was a bill pro
viding for submission to the people of consti
tutional amendment No. 28. In some unac
countable manner it slipped through both
houses without attracting the attention of men
who can always be depended upon to be alert
in defeating such vicious measures.
This amendment has not one redeeming fea
ture. It ought to be and will be overwhelmingly
defeated if the newspapers of both parties do
their duty and keep their readers well informed
as to Its provisions.
A great majority of people are willing to be
lieve that there are too many commissions and
that some of them ought to be abolished, but
the proposed amendment is not the proper
remedy.
If It Is adopted the effect will be to abolish
all boards that now exist and the purpose of
which is to In any manner regulate or control
the corporations now doing business in Cali
fornia. But all the powers now exercised by
existing boards and commissions will be, by
the adoption of this amendment, conferred upon
one commission of five men. The first com
mission is to be appointed by the Governor,
but all other commissions are' to be elected
by districts and the term of office is ten years.
We agree with tbe Fresno Republican that
more dangerous powers were never conferred
by law on any single body of men. They
would have the power to block all effective
legislation of corporations during their entire
term of office.
As before stated the amendment was passed
by the Legislature at a time when but a few
of the members were familiar with Its provis
ions. A joint committee of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and League of California
Municipalities summarizes the effects as fol
lows: It will Increase taxation. It makes im-
possible the securing- of any reduction of rates
for any public service. It perpetuates the In
efficient features of the Railroad Commission.
It Interferes with local self-government. It
places inordinate power In the hands of the
Governor. It will deprive cities and counties
of all license fees now paid by public corpora
tions. It takes away from local bodies all con
trol of franchises.
A resolution opposing' this amendment -was
sent to the platform, committee of the State
League of Republican Clubs, but it was voted
down. Will some member of -that convention
give some good reason for such action? Many
of the leading Republican papers of the State
are criticizing the action of the committee In
refusing to report the resolution, and we be
lieve the rebuke ia merited. We cannot bellevs
that any respectable number of Republicans
favor this amendment. What then was the In
fluence that controlled the Saa Jose conven
tion in lta favor?

DEMOCRATIC A.3ST3D inSTDEFEINrDEKTC 1 I*RESS,
Wheat has attracted a good deal of attention dur
ing the past week. A fortnight ago an upward move
ment set in, owing to dry weather over the greater
portion of the winter wheat belt, and for a few days
the outlook was dubious; but rains came along, and
although they were not heavy they were sufficiently
copious to not only check the advance but send the
market back again. Outside of Kansas, which has
been the principal sufferer from drought, and which
cannot now raise a full crop even under the most
favorable conditions, the prospects are first rate, and
the scare over a possible winter wheat failure is about
over. Corn and oats are in the same category with
wheat, and all three have a much better outlook than
In San Francisco and California the trade condi
tions could hardly be better. Crop prospects are
fine, thanks to the recent rains, which visited almost
every section of the State, and everybody is looking
forward to bounteous harvests of grain, fruit, wine,
hops, vegetables and all those varied products which
make the State a garden and give it a large per
centage of its wealth. Commercial travelers, who
are in a position to know the financial- condition of
the State, say that wherever they go they find a good
demand for their different lines, with easy collections
and very few failures. They say, furthermore, that
everybody expects the present prosperity to continue
indefinitely, and that a tone of cheerfulness pervades
the whole commercial community from one end of
the State to the other. "V
These points cover the general business situation
throughout the United States. Prosperity still re
mains with us, and thus far there are no unfavorable
signs on the horizon. Prices, to be sure, are high,
but as far as can be seen this is due, not to specula
tion or inflation, but to a general light supply of the
ordinar}' necessaries of a comfortable American ex
istence. Eventually, of course, production, stimu
lated by the current scarcity, will reach and pass con
sumption, when there will be a recession in values;
but that point Has apparently not yet been reached.
Whatever hesitation exists seems to be confined to
the Atlantic seaboard, as the rest of the country re
ports a fine distributive trade in almost all lines of
produce and merchandise. Cotton is higher and is
now one cent over last year. Meats have also ad
vanced, with livestock scarce and likely to continue
so for some little time yet. Provisions are unsettled
and irregular, but the general tendency is upward
rather than downward. Groceries show no particular
change, but they 'are moving briskly everywhere, and
np depression is noted in any line.
GENERAL business was reported in better
condition last week, and the recent hesita
tion seems to have almost disappeared.
True, the bank clearings, which are accepted as the
index to trade, are still running somewhat behind
those of last year, the loss last- week being 8.6 per
cent, but the aggregated clearances of the country
footed up $2,685,159,000, which shows an immense
volume of trade. New York fell off 14 per cent,
owing to dullness in Wall street, but this is not an
unmixed evil, and a loss of 12.9 per cent at Pittsburg
indicates a corresponding decrease in the iron and
steel trades as compared with 1901. But both these
lines stili report continued activity, with scarcity of
raw material and orders enough to keep the numer
ous mills of the country running for some months
yet without any new business, which, however, is
coming in just as usual. Boston also shows a loss
of 13.4 per cent, which may be attributable to lessened
boot and shoe shipments and the hesitation in the
wool trade due to strikes, but whereas the East in
general reports a dull wool market, the West is send
ing in reports of an active demand for wool at firm
quotations.

Were these questions new, delay and hesitation in
Congress could be easily understood, but they are
riot new. They have been discussed a long time.
They have been embodied in Republican platforms
and ratified by : the people again, and again. is
therefore time that action be taken upon them. ' It
will be a gross political blunder for the Republican
leaders to go before the couptry in the fall elections
without having done something for American ship
ping and the isthmian canal.
The Secretary went on to say it is immaterial
whether the great merchant fleet be built up by gov
ernmental aid or by individual enterprise, the main
thing being to obtain the fleet needed to carry our
ocean-going commerce. Within certain limits,
which the Secretary doubtless intended his audience
to understand, the statement is true enough. It
would be better to build up a merchant marine with
out protection if we could, but as- a matter of fact we
cannot. The large subsidies granted by foreign gov
ernments to their merchant marine, the lower rate
of wages paid to sailors, and other advantages pos
sessed by foreign lines, prevent American built ships,
manned by American sailors and flying the American
flag, from successful competition. Recently, when'
Pierpont Morgan found it advisable to obtain ships
to carry the immense output of his consolidated in
dustries, he'found it cheaper to purchase foreign
ships, maintain, them under a foreign flag, and em
ploy foreign sailors, than to build American ships.
That is the situation, and we shall have to wait a
long time for an adequate American merchant
marine unless Congress grant to the shipping^in
dustry the same measure of protection given to in
dustries on land.
Concerning our shipping Mr. Shaw said: "We

breezes and these carriers of international commerce
must be built of American material, in American
yards, â¢by American labor. They are to be manned
by American sailors, fired by American coal, or more
probably oil, and they are to float the Stars and
Stripes."
That is an old story, but it seems necessary to re
peat it again and again to impress its significance
upon Congress. At the present time the advocates
of the canal are at loggerheads over a dispute about
the route. It is safe to, say there is not one in ten
among the American people who cares much which
route is preferred. Every man wishes of course that
the best route be chosen, but at the same time every
intelligent man is aware that neither route is superior
to the other in every respect. Each has its advan
tages and its disadvantages. The choice between
them is a matter upon which even experts disagree.
Unanimity of judgment will never be reached; and
the public therefore has a right to insist that the dis
pute be ended, some choice be made by a majority
vote and the work begun;
Such being the situation it is gratifying that Secre
tary Shaw should have made the Grant . birthday
banquet an occasion fpr recalling public attention. to
the importance of the.' two bills. Â¦Referring' to v the
canal he said: "Not as the crow, flies, but -as ships
sail, it is-nearer from Liverpool to San Francisco, via
Cape Horn, than from New York to the same port,
via the same southern extremity. Start two ships. of
equal. speed from Liverpool going to our; Pacific
Coast, one through the Suez Canal and the, other
by Cape Horn, and two vessels of -the same speed
from New, York," one going: westward and the other
eastward, and both English vessels- will reach their
destination before either of ours. Cut the 'isthmian
canal and it is nearer from New York to Hongkong,
via Nicaragua, than from Liverpool to the same
point via the Suez."
AMERICAN commerce is at 'the present time
so much dependent upon the upbuilding of
an adequate merchant marine and the con
struction of an isthmian canal that- the country notes
with something of indignation the;'delay and hesita
tion of Congress in dealing with; the bills designed to
accomplish those much. desired measures. The Sen
ate has passed a shipping, bill and the -House has
passed an isthmian canal, bill, but at that point ac
tivity has stopped. The Senate bill rests -in a com
mittee of the House and the House; bill rests- in the
Senate; and there is danger that /unless the people
be urgent in demanding >ction neither measure will
become law during this session. ... : . Â¦ ' / . : .

Pomona Progress:
Gage dies. hard. ' : ; '
. In spite of the efforts of the Gage push from
all parts of the. State to boom the Governor's
cause at the League of Republican Clubs con
vention at San Jose, the Belshazzar writing is
said to have been plainly visible on the wall,
and the ellenco of delegates from, all parts of
the State a I the mention of the Governor's
name was more forcible and ominous than the
loud shouting of the Burns and Gage rooters.
It had been announced by the Gage organs that
the. real "show down" of the campaign among
the candidates for the. Republican nomination
for Governor â¢ would come at this convention.
But lfdlda't come, for so strong was the senti
ment- againbt Gage at the convention that It
would have split the party had It been at
tempted. The. Gage leaders,, who are among
the shrewdest and .. most experienced political
manipulators I and \ managers of conventions in
the State, Â»were largely in control of the con
vention; but the handwriting was on the wall
Justthe same. Â¦â¢ â¢-.. Â¦Â¦Â¦
Â¦â¢ -We do not believe that , Gage will ever be
Governor again, and If he Is nominated It will
be by the bosses, and not by the people.
.With only a local reputation as a criminal
lawyer, four years ago the bosses snatched him
out of' obscurity and the* people made him
Governor. . But It didn't work; he was too
email bore. -You can never make a whistle out
of a pig's tall.' From the Governor's attempt
to make Dan Burns a United States Senator on
through, his administration has been anything
but' a credit to the State.
San Dieg-o Union :
The letter of Governor Gage to the San Jose
Republican convention should disgust even his
followers. -A more transparently hypocritical
epistle was never penned by a tricky politician.
The' Governor,- with an assumption of virtue
that will bring smiles to the faces of all who
know him. informs the gathering that he can
not attend because its "momentous delibera
tions should be absolutely exempt from all per
sonal influence of candidates," and because the
convention's labors "cannot be free from'em
barrassing Influences If aspirants for guberna
torial honors attend."
Having thus attempted to cast a slur upon
several gentlemen who are attending the con
vention although they, are supposed to be "as
pirants," the Governor proceeds to do a little
stroke of business on his own account. Al
though his virtuous scruples do not permit him
to be there, he hastens to Inform the gathering
In very explicit language that he desires and
expects to be renominated. Presumably ac
cording to the Gage ethics, this blunt statement
â which sounds much like the crack of a whip
â will not be regarded as the "personal in
fluence" of a candidate, whereas were the Gov
ernor to attend, occupy a back seat and keep
his mouth shut, the convention might feel It
self under his potent sway. Governor Gage is
always most transparent when he fancies him
self most profund.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Gage machine, well oiled and carefully
adjusted as it is, slipped a cog. disastrously at
the convention of the Lieague of Republican
Clubs, which has just concluded its session at
San Joee.
The committee on resolutions drafted a
formal Indorsement of the Governor's adrnln-
lstration, but this did not suit some of his
partisans. They Insisted that the resolution
should read "warmly Indorse." But when the
committee took a vote twenty-one of its mem
bers declined to accept the little adverb that
was designed to take the chill oft a perfunc
tory Indorsement, and only seven committee
men favored it. So the resolution unrelieved
of its cold formality went to the convention
and was adopted as it came from the commit
tee. ; â¢
The Incident would be significant in any cir
cumstances, but it is especially so in view
of the fact that Governor Gage had served
formal notice on the convention that he is a
candidate and ''desires and expects" a renom
ination. Had a majority of the delegates been
favorably, inclined to his aspirations, there
would have been little trouble in inserting, on
the floor of the convention, . the "warmly In
dorse" which the committee rejected by an
overwhelming vote. It does not appear, how
ever, that a single delegate attempted to In
fuse any life into the committee's frigid reso
lution. The gathering, so .the dispatches say.
tv as extremely harmonious, and the harmony
was not broken by any member foolish enough
to seek action that might seem like recognition
of the Governor's pretensions.
The plain fact is that the Governor was
firmly turned down by the San Jose conven
t:on. Republicans who do not wish to see
their party disgraced as well as beaten will
cherish the hope that the turning down process
so auspiciously begun at the league conven
tion may continue until Governor Gage and
his gang of practical politicians cease to be a
factor In the Republican party of California. iÂ»
Los Angeles Times:
In the. case of an executive officer who has
performed some great and signal service,
whose administration haa been distinguished
In some unusual manner. It Is customary for
his party to compliment him with a nomina
tion for a second term. This is well. It Is
no more than a just recognition of services
well performed. It Is a compliment to the
official, but - it Is not a right which he may
demand. Â¦
Such a compliment should be paid to a faith
ful and exceptionally competent official, if he
be deemed worthy of It, by the spontaneous
action of his party, and with practical unan
imity. Unless It comes to him in such manner,
and with such unanimity, it is of compara
tively little value. Certainly an "Indorsement"
which the executive officer is obliged to pull
wires for â to scheme and plan for like a ward
politician â is of no substantial or permanent
value. A triumph' won by such methods Is
but little better than defeat, and Is worse than
defeat in some respects.
In the case of the Gage administration in
California has It been distinguished for notable
achievement? Has It been other than com
monplace and perfunctory? Has Henry T.
Gage done anything in his capacity as Governor
of the State to merit a renomination? Has his
administration been better than that of any of
his predecessors? Has he In anywise dem
onstrated to the* satisfaction of the people of
this commonwealth that he is so valuable in
the office of chief executive that he should
be honored by a second term? Has he. in
point of fact, any valid or recognizable claim
to a renomihation? . -. .
No unprejudiced man can truthfully answer
these questions in the affirmative. Not only
are there no substantial reasons for the re
nomination of Governor Gage, but there are
many strong reasons why he should not be
renomlnated, as the Times has already shown,
and as It expects to demonstrate In the future.
These - reasons need not be enumerated here.
They could not be enumerated without filling
several columns of space. But they are ample,
sufficient, conclusive. â¢
The Republican party of California cannot
afford to risk the experiment of a renomination
which would almost certainly lead straight tÂ»

The revolt against the boss domination of
Colonel Burns Is widespread and deep seated.
In traveling over the State we find It every
where Men have told us that they had noth
ing particular against Governor Gage, except
that he was controlled by Colonel Burns.
It Is this widespread feeling that the wlsÂ«
political leaders will take Into account when
coolly calculating the chances of winning out
In the campaign this fall. Conceding the fact
that the State is 20,000 Republican, the change
of only a few votes In each precinct In tha

campaign â and defeated one of the best men
California ever had. The Reeling: Is stronger
to-day than It was then, and the tame result
will follow If Governor Gage is renomlnated.
In no one. thing did the Gage forces at San
Jose this week so overreach themselves as in
letting the Gage letter be read. It was a wan
ton, brutal, vicious and uncalled-for insult to
the honest and honorable- gentlemen who went
to the convention as Republicans, albeit they
were candidates for the high office of Gov
error.
Pasadena News:
Governor Gage wrote a letter to the San
Jose convention that was much criticized and
which didn't do him any good, saying that he
greatly desired a renomination. If the Stata
convention were called now. It looks as If hla
trained cohorts could force his nomination.
But it Is four months off and with the big
newspapers pouring hot shot into his camp,
there is no telling what It may look like by
that time. Flint has declared he is going to
stay to the end.
Therefore, unless the unexpected happens,
the next State convention may be a repetition
of the legislative deadlock, with Gage substi
tuted for Burns In the center of the field. It
will be a battle royal to a finish.
One of the unexpected things which is be
ing: whispered about is that Gage may get out
of the gubernatorial race and take up the
Senatorial fight against Senator George C.
Perkins. It will be remembered that the Sen
atorial toga is what Gage first Â¦ reached for
when he emerged from his Los Angeles law
office four years ago when Colonel Burns and
W. F. Herrin switched him off toward Sacra
mt-nto.
Pomcna Progress:
We do not believe that Gage will ever be
Governor again; and If he Is nominated It will
be by the bosses and not by the people.
Â¦Considering how much trouble even Americans
have in trying to straighten out the' conflict .between
the civil and the military; authorities in the Philip

doubt whether to be friehds.orenemies/ In fact the
American newspaper men at Manila seem to* tie] as
badly bewildered as the natives and several- of them
are in jail for guessing wrong. , ". r ;
Office--Holding Push and Democratic Agitators Com
pose the Governor's Support.
It is to be borne in mind that the opposition to
Gage does not come from a clique, nor is it confined
to a single section of the State. It has arisen from
the mass of the Republican party and owes its origin
to the actions and the speeches of Gage himself. It
is due to his open subservience to the corporations,
to his degradation of the normal schools and chari
table institutions of the State, to the spoils of politics,
to his appointment of incompetent and vicious men
to official position, and to the petty spitefulness with
which he acts toward every one who differs from
him in opinion. His administration has been a pro
longed scandal from the day he showed himself* the
ally of Herrin in the conspiracy to elect Burns to
the. United States Senate. He has amazed and of
fended those who supported him in his first cam
paign, and to-day has no strength except that which
can be obtained for him by the combination of
Democratic and Republican bosses under the con
trol of Billy Herrin.
An opposition so widespread and so well founded
cannot be overcome by an appeal to party fealty.
Thousands of Republicans will vote against Gage, if
the bosses should by any trick bring about his re
nomination. Consequently, all who have the welfare
of the Republican party at heart, and desire to see
it win a sweeping victory this fall, must earnestly
work to baffle Herrin's conspiracy. In no county
should the bosses be permitted to appoint the dele
gates to the State convention. Every delegate
should be a true representative of his constituency
and be elected at an honest primary by the votes of
genuine Republicans.
In this juncture the rank and file of the party have
a right to look to the State Central Committee for
assistance in the fight for honest primaries. It is
true the. State committee cannot dictate the holding
of primaries, but their recommendation "will have a
good deal of influence in that direction. The "ex
ecutive committee ought therefore to earnestly urge
the holding of primaries for the election of delegates
to the State convention. An initiative should be
given to the movement to assure every true Repub
lican a chance to take part in the selection of dele
gates who are to represent him in making nominal
tions for the State ticket.
The fight for Gage is now virtually a fight
against the Republican party. Protests against his
renomination have come so universally from the Re
publican press, and from the true leaders of -the
party, as to render it no longer doubtful that if nomi
nated he will be defeated. His nomination, therefore,
will be disastrous to the party, and those who are
seeking to bring it about are clearly resolved to ruin
the party if they cannot rule it.
The Call has exposed some of the workipgs of the
bosses to procure the appointment of Gage delegates,
or rather of Herrin delegates, for while they will vote
for the renomination of Gage it will be at Herrin's
dictation. It must not be supposed, however, that
the localities specified by The Call are the only places
where t$e tricksters are at work. It is safe to say
there is not a single place in the State outside those
in which the law requires primaries to be held that
is not the scene of plotting and planning on the part
of the conspirators who are trying to betray the Re
publican State convention into the hands of the Dem
ocratic boss employed as -the political agent of the
Southern Pacific Company. Republicans, therefore,
must be everywhere vigilant. The bosses are not go
ing to leave any chance of gaining a delegate over
looked, nor any trick untried to accomplish, their
purpose.
WHEN Herrin's henchmen found they could
not obtain from the convention of Repub
lican clubs at San Jose a straightout in
dorsement of Gage under any circumstances, and had
to resort to trickery to get even a perfunctory refer
ence to his administration, they realized that the op-,
position of the Republican rank and file to the cor
poration scheme is too formidable for them to over
come by fair tactics; and thereupon they began with
more zeal than ever to work out a plan to capture
the convention by having delegates appointed' by
local bosses instead of being elected by primaries.
Against the new tactics genuine Republicans must
now array themselves. The appointment scheme
must be met and defeated.

ing, and. served until May, 1861, part of
the time as Acting Governor. He was
elected to Congress in I860, but was un
seated as ths result of a contest. He was
four times nominated by Â¦ his â¢ party for
Governor of Nebraska, but waa defeated
each time. He was a stalwart "gold
man," and had an early. falling out with
Hon. William J. Bryan, whose political
aspirations he opposed vigorously. He
was Identified officially with many agri
cultural and horticultural ofnaials.
The ex-Secretary was the author of Ar
bor day, April 22, which began to be
observed generally during his Incumbency
as head of the Department of Agriculture
and which is now- observed in all thB
States. His constant motto was "plant
trees," and these words lie had stamped
In large letters, under a picture of a tree
on his stationery. He waa an inveterate
letter writer. He found keen enjoyment
in answering communications from farm
ers and it was no unusual occurrence for
him to call newspaper men Into his of
fice to read the answers he was writing
to farmers, often giving out portions of
them for publication.
victions, unswerving honesty, and un
doubted ability. By nature a controver
sialist, Mr. Morton came to the Cabinet
With many fixed ideas about the govern
ment service. He was a practical farmer
and ran his department along practical
lines, but, nevertheless, ' not without
many sauabbles. He regarded the dis
tribution of seeds as paternalistic, and on
that subject found himself in opposition
to Congress.
SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE IN THE SECOND CLEVELAND CABI
NET AND THE FOUNDER OF "ARBOR DAY," \ViIO HAS 8UC
, CUMBED TO THE EFFECTS OF AN ATTACK OF GRIP.
"Another reason why I place no cred
ence in the agreement lies in the fact
that Haytlans have not yet forgotten the
harsh measures adopted by the Berlin
Government several years ago. German
interests are not as important in Haytl
as are those of the United States and
France. There, is as little foundation for
the agreement, I am sure, as there is for
the report that President Sam desires to
assume the role of dictator."
"I have heard nothing whatever of the
reported secret agreement alleged to have
been entered into between General Le
conte. Minister of Public Works, and a
German syndicate. I am confident that
no such agreement exists. In the first
place, the constitution of Haytl forbids
the alienation of a single foot of territory
to a foreign government. In the second
place, the people of Hayti are Intensely
patriotic and they love their country too
deeply to permit its curtailment, v Beyond
this is the fact that if Hayti were willing
to permit the establishment of a coaling
station on her soil, Grant more than
twenty-five years ago would have ob
tained such concession, for he did his ut
most to that effect.
German diplomats say there la abso
lutely no ground for believing that their
government is interested in the action
of German subjects in Haytl, and that
they are weary of denying reports that
their Government contemplates a viola
tion of the Monroe doctrine. At the same
time it is admitted that it may be ad
vantageous for Germany, if it should turn
out that her subjects have obtained ex
clusive rights to establish and maintain
coaling stations in the little republic.
Mr. Leger said this afternoon that the
report that a secret agreement prejudicial
to the United States has been entered into
by the Minister of Public Works and
German subjects had probably been put
out In the interest of one of the candi
dates for the Presidency of Hayti. Ho
deplored the publication of such rumors,
because they might have the effect of
shaking the confidence of American cap
italists in his country. He continued;
These two statements succinctly express
the attitude of the United States, as ex
plained to-night by a high official of the
administration, and of Hayti, as described
by K. N. Leger, Minister of that country
In "Washington.
The United States cannot object to any
private syndicate or corporation establish
ing a coal pile in Haytl or any place else
on American soil, but the moment it is
evident a foreign government exercises
control over that pile and the territory
upon which it is placed the administration
will act.
"Hayti Is forbidden by Her constitution
and is too patriotic to cede an inch of her
territory to a foreign nation, no matter
what may be the use to which it is pro
posed to put it."

TENNIS EXPERTS
ON PARK COURTS
The morning game over the water was
witnessed by fully 2000 people. It was a
slaughtering affair, with Dr. Moskiman
in the role of the innocent lamb. The
Senators cinched the contest in the open
ing rond by landing on the medical man
for five hits, including three two-cushion
swipes and a forced run by a base on
balls, netting in all seven runs. After this
thd "Doc" became disgusted, and in the
eighth 'Fisher's" men made four more.
Moskiman was badly unnerved, and gave
a poor exhibition of the pitcher's art.
Thomas twirled in great style, allow
ing but seven hits in all. He was cool
and steady, and kept the home team con
tinually guessing. The Oakland rooters
became disgusted with their favorites,
and cheered the Senators to victory. The
score: " Â¦ ' ' , * '

SUMMARY. '
Two-baae hitâ Schmidt. '" Sacrifice" hitsâ Moh-
Mike Fisher ran wildly to the scorer's
stand and protested the game. Mike was
intensely excited, and could - give 'no
grounds for his prqtest.' ;When- seen
later he said he would protest on i the
ground that Dowling did not interfere
with Francks; but added that he sup
posed he would have to stand for the lost
game. ' ... â¢ . ..v, Â¦, ' '
The grounds were packed, between 7000
and 8000 spectators viewing the struggle.
Most of those present .did not-under
stand the final decision, and swarmed
out on the field, some cheering and oth
ers hooting. There could be no question
as to the Justness of O'Connell's decision,
as Dowling plainly .went out .of . his way
to balk the throw.
Thef game was an ideal one, abounding
in hard hitting, fast ! fielding and clever
base running. It really, possessed every
thing that- goes " to make baseball' a
worthy sport. , Oakland landed hard on
Dowling ' throughout, : while Schmidt was
a puzzle in all but -two innings. Little
Mohler was again the brightest star- in
the field, S while big. McCreedle had the
batting- honors to himself, with three hits
out of four trips to bat. .<
Oakland scored a run in the first! two
in the second and one in the fourth round.
This was all j accomplished ( by landing
good 'and hard on DowUng. Errors played
no part whatever in the annexing . of
tallies. Fisher's giants completed the
rounds in the third, ; fifth and ninth,
Graham and Wagner being the run get
ters. Schmidt's liberality in distributing
passes had something to "do with this,
but ' he was also hit some when hits
meant runs. The score: , ,, Â¦ .' Â¦
â¢ / OAKLAND.- ' ' '- Â¦
OAKLAND and Sacramento broke
even on the baseball field yester
day, but the series went to the
men' from across the bay, ~ they
capturing three out of five games.
The c6ntest across the bay. was a pro
cession of Senators over the home plate,
while the game at Recreation -Park was
brilliant and fast, going to Ewing's stick
ers to the quickstep music of 4 to 3.
The ending was unsatisfactory to the
Senatorial followers, but nevertheless it
was justly the Oakland team's victory.
With one out in the first half of the
ninth inning, two on the bases and the
score 4 to 3 in Oakland's favor, Sheehan
hit an easy grounder to .Mohler, who
threw to FrancKs. ana he retired Dow
ling, who was running from second.
Francks was in the act of slamming the
sphere ta Streib to get Sheehan and com
plete a double play, when Dowling delib
erately interfered with the throw, which
went over Streib's head. Wagner, -who
was at second, scored, but' Umpire O'Con
nell, who was closely watching the play,
called Sheehan out, giving Oakland the
credit of the double play and the gameâ
4 to 3.

~ Probably on no \ occasion during the
present season at the Ingleslde live bird
traps have the trap shooters~inore enjoy
ed the sport than they did yesterday at
the club shoot of the Golden Gate Club.
Although there was not an exceptionally
large attendance, all the contests were
marked with considerable interest and ex
citement. The birds furnished by the
club were all strong and speedy flyers
and most of them were of a dark color
and made very difficult targets.
After the club shoot had been conclud
ed the shooters spent several hours in
shooting off six-bird pool races. In these
contests some very fine marksmanship
was displayed. In the fourth pool event.
In which there were eight entries with six
birds to each man, but three out of the
forty-eight birds were missed, and one of
these were prouounced dead out of
bounds. "K

The Jinks on Saturday night was bril
liantly successful, the various Items of
the programme meeting -with an enthu
siastic reception from the large crowd of
yachtsmen. So many were in attendance
that the boats of the fleet and hotels In
the town were taxed to their utmost ca
pacity to find sleeping room for all.
Shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, on signal gun from the flagship, the
fleet got under way and proceeded over
to the channel, where the yachts cruised
up and down along the -water front-Among
the yachts under way were The Challen
ger carrying Commodore K. S. Bridg
man's flag; the sloop Thetis, ex-Governor
George W. Baxter's schooner Ramona, W.
W. Haley's sloop Rover, Dr. A. "W. Mc-
Kenzle's sloop Sappho, G. W. Muchmore's
yawl Royal, I>r. T. L. Hill's sloop Cygnua,
the yawl Witch, the sloops Anita, Hal
cyon and Surprise. â¢ -
The San Francisco fleet was accompan
ied on its opening cruise by Commodora
E. F. Sager's flagship Edna, Frank Bart
lett's yawl Spray and the yawl Arcturaa
of the Corinthian Yacht Club; Commodore
S. S. Marshall's flagship Thelma, tha
yawl Idler, the sloops PactoUis, Secret.
Mascotte and Catharine of the California
Yacht Club. The sloops Harpoon and
Presto' had a trial of speed In the channel,
and The Challenger was also out for
practice.
The sloop Edna while In the stiff, steady
breeze In the channel hung on to Tha
Challenger, but the new San Francisco
sloop forged rapidly ahead when the wind
lightened. On board The Challenger were
W. G. Morrow, Commodore R. S. Brldg
man, J. R. Savory. C. F. Austin, Vica
Commodore A. C. Lee, G. T. S. White, A.
W. Follansbee. A. R. Hasklns, J. C. Cock
erlll and W. Westwater. From the chan
nel The Challenger ran over to Raccoon
Straits, where she -was compelled to lower
her mainsail on account of the breaking
of one of her throat halyard blocks. The
halyard was reeved through a fre3b block
and The Challenger sailed back to her
moorings.
Nearly all the yachts had large parties
on board, ex-Governor George W. Bax
ter's guests being Mr. Lawrence of Den
ver. Louis Q. Haven, F. J. Clute and Ar
thur Inkersley. The -well known schooner,
having had her spars cut down and masts
set straight up, stands up better in a
strong breeze than formerly and behaves
splendidly in the open sea. She will .re
turn to her moorings at Monterey on
Tuesday.
The day was an Ideal one yesterday for
the opening cruise of the San Francisco
Yacht Club, a flood tide, strong breeze and
smooth sea being the prevailing condi
tions. .

End the profits of industry are shared be
tween employer and employe, told the
Dotty Club last night in Golden Gate Hall
ttout his experiences i i striving for in
dustrial betterment. Nelson, although a
philanthropist, is eminently a practical
Kian, and his remarks were full of com
mon sense. â¢ I
He eai-i that in founding his Utopian
town he had been influenced by no theo
ries such as are entertained by the"so
cialists and anarchists, but that In carry
ing out his common sense plans he had
accomplished all that these theorists are
aitr.ing at. The fundamental rule of Le
Claire is that no one shall be compelled
â¢o do anything against his will. The citi-.
zens of the town, being surrounded by
pood neighbors and comfortable condi
tior.s, have no inclination to do anything
wrong, and therefore policemen have
bf*>n disptnsed with.
Mr. Nelson raid that they had not
r.eglected to provide amusement for the
people as wt-ll as work. They have con
structed bowline alleys, poolrooms, foot
ball and baseball grounds. When the
people first came from the cities to Le
Claire, he said, they did not have much
*-are for the beautiful, but that they, had
since become educated In that xospect,
and that now Itielr' homes were surround
ed with lawns, flowers' were being culti
vated and orchards set out.
Preceding Mr. Nelson's talk Rev. B. F.
jlills delivered an interesting lecture on

Saturday afternoon came near meeting
with disaster. A strong wind was blow

in the rough sea. the propeller sometimes
racing out of water. During one of these
periods the shaft snapped and the launch
was at the mercy of the wind and waves.
The captain of the schooner ran his tow

until assistance could be secured.

of gifts will be able to remember a time
when a more beautiful display has been
seen in San Francisco. There is* an abun

Mr. Howard E. Huntington. a brother,
of the bride-elect, has given her 150 vol
umes of the most . able writers. The
books are simply bound in morocco. Mrs.
H. E. Huntington's gift is a large lovers'
knot of diamonds, from which " is sus
pended two chains of diamonds, one hav
ing at the end a pearl and the other a
diamond. The bride will wear with the
bridal robe a large string of pearls with
a diamond heart suspended. This was
given her by Mrs. C. P. Huntington. No
one has had a glimpse of the wonderful
white gown yet. Miss Huntington will
surprise her friends. Some of - the Inti-.
mate friends have had a good look at the
trousseau, however, and cannot say
enough to express their admiration.
The bride-elect and her mother spent
several weeks in New York selecting the
garments and have certainly displayed
the best of taste. There are beautiful
house gowns of clinging crepe de chine
and other more filmy materials, with the
daintiest of laces and ribbons. It would
be impossible to deseribe the bewildering
array of breakfast jackets and , negUge
affairs. Most of the gowns are of thin
summer materials, as Mr. and Mrs.'Per
kins will spend the summer at New York,
having taken apartments at the Majestic
Hotel. :
The Interesting groom-elect arrived Sat
urday. He is tall, thin and interesting.
He would not be called g.ood looking by
everybody, but that is not important. Ho
is a Princeton graduate and comes of
good family, but it will never, be
said that Miss Huntington has married
him for money. Mr. Perkins is engaged
in a broker's office In New York City.
There is always something genuinely re
freshing and delightful about a lovo
match, and we are glad this couple has
so much happiness ahead of them.

Charles Clark of the Grove-street sys
tem of the Oakland Transit Consolidated
is president of this organization. In re
gard to this move he said:
The organization of the. carmen In Oak
land is somewhat unique. â¢ The Carmen s
Social and Benevolent Society Includes a
very, large majority of -the carmen of
Oakland, only a few on the San Pablo
and Telegraph-avenue lines not being
members, and many of the men who have
left the road still retain membership in
the organization. â¢ It is not affiliated with
any union, but is stronger and more com
plete in its membership than any union
In Oakland. There has never been any
dlfference between the company and the
society over recognition.
'the' men 'and the company over the recognition
of their social and benevolent society. "We have
always aided their entertainments and will
continue to do so, and we, consider that It Is &
good thjngr for the men and for the company
to -keep them together.: We ;Â¦ hope during the
coming year to be able to do other things that
will ad'l to the pleasure of oar employes.

We hope to be able' to encourage the most
cordial relations between our employes and
the management of the road. In doing this
we feel that the comoany will, receive some
benefit in. anore careful attention to the. patrons
and the property of the company. The Increase
-in waues given by the Transit Comiiany. was
purely voluntary. No. demands had been made
Upon us by the men, either individually orits
an organization, but we felt that wages in
other lines of business not requiring so much
skill were Increasing and with the better con
dition of our company we felt that a flat in
crease could be afforded. We have been pay
ing 21 cents an hour to all men, with bonus
men above that. A flat increase was decided
upon rather than an Increase In the bonus.
COMPANY WILL BENEFIT.
In addition to the Increase in. wages the
Oakland Transit Company has 3 several
plans which directly concern the â¢ em
ployes and their families, and which give
the fullest recognition to the carmen's or
ganization on this side of the bay. ThesÂ»
plans include a series of outings during
the summer, to be conducted by the man
agement of the road, to which not only
the men, but their families, will be invit-<
ed. There will be outings to various
parks on the lines of the Transit' Com
pany, the full expenses of which, includ
ing transportation, music and entertain
ment, will be paid by <he company. The
entertainments given during the year by
the Carmen's Society will all be aided by
the company in the matter of decoration,
special llghtlne. special cars and similar
additions. Regarding -the ' company's
move. Manager Kelly said:
The representatives of the . Transit
Company say that. they are satisfied and
the men declare themselves equally so. - :
OAKLAND, April 27.-^There will be
no trouble between the Oakland
Transit Consolidated and its em
ployes. The action, of the com
pany in making a voluntary in
crease in the pay of 'the men has settled
that, and while. the men tin Oakland are,
paid a cent, an hour less than In San.
Francisco, under the new schedule in that
city, both the men and ' the company feel
that the Oakland wages are equivalent to
those in San Francisco t when the differ
ence in the cost of living is considered.
If any trouble was ever contemplated, tho
action of General Manager" Kelly of the
Transit Company has checked^lt, and the
men will accept the new â¢ schedule' of
.wages, which will go into effect a full
month before the new schedule : in San
Francisco. . â¢ . â¢Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦-:Â¦"â¢Â¦ -
Dr. Guinness talked from his vast ex
perience in the London hospitals and. the
hospitals of other cities and besought his
hearers to lead a pure and. godlike life
and avoid . all ' temptations. He quote'l
Sir Andrew Clarke, the eminent physician
and surgeon, who had said that "nature
never forgives and never forgets," and
demonstrated the necesity for the care of
the health and the husbanding of the
strength. "The way to manliness." he
said, "Is along the line of godliness, and
the finest specimens of manhood I have
ever met are those men who are godlike,
pure In thought and pure in 6very action."
This evening' Dr. Guinness will lecture
at the* Young Men's Christian Associa
tion on "The Cannibals of the Congo."
The lecture will be free.
. The doctor, who has just arrived from
Australia on his journey home to London,
has himself done a great deal of mission
ary work, as he said, "purely for the love
of the labor," and with no pecuniary re
sults! .â¢'.. .

I congratulate the Mayor of this city and the

iir.d the railroad authorities upon the 3000 em

The Rev. Mr. Baker said that he con
sidered this one of the greatest strikes in
the history of our country- "Thank God,"
he said, "that this unparalleled labor dis
ruption is ended and that it has ended in
the right manner because it was fought in
the right wayâ not* by pugilistic force or
native pugnacity, but by the force of calm
reasoning and the inspiration of principle
;jid Christian brotherhood.
/ may now ask why it was that the
carmen won their fight," continued the
Hev. Mr. Baker. "It was not simply be
cause of the tine type of character of the
men; not because their grievances were
real; nor was it wholly because of the
unanimous public opinion in their favor.
All these iiÂ» themselves would not have
won the struggle. They won because- of
their unbroken union not under the con
trol, of a demagogue who used his power
to bully or harass employers making un
reasonable demands and precipitating
abor contests in which the interests of all
Â¦ lasses were sacrificed to the self-import
ance of ihe demagogue.

According to Burke's story, when the
boat seemed hopelessly in the power of
the storm, which was terrific, the party
got into' the rigging, the captain, his wife
and Morris on the leeside of the boat.
The boat soon filled with water and fell
over onto the lee side, throwing the three
persons into the water and drowning them
almost immediately.
JBurke retained his position in the rig

gold, is available in the open market, and

. The reports of the Iron market repre
sent that situation to be quieter, but the
export demand remains strong, particu
larly to the United States, . which is
buying more billets and plates, while the
Southern States are buying more rails.
Iron shares declined generally. The coal
trade did not show improvement, j and
coal shares weakened. The most ani
mated stock during the week was again
Canadian Pacific, which continued to be
bought heavily for English and American
account. '
The crop reports of the empire v show
that good conditions prevail everywhere.

An alarm of fire was rung in from box
97 and the slight blaze in the house where
the accident occurred was quickly extin
guished by the firemen.
In telling of the accident Mrs. Attwood
said she was preparing to leave the house
to visit' a neighbor and was carrying a
lighted glass lamp into the parlor. "While
placing the/ lamp on the bureau she struck
it â¢ sharply on the marble top and
broke the lamp. The oil saturated her
clothing and before she could recover her
self the oil became Ignited and enveloped
her in the flames. A short - time after
making her statement .: Mrs. Attwood
lapsed into unconsciousness, dying at 2
a. m.
The suffering woman was taken to the
Central Emergency Hospital and an ex
amination ; by Dr. Murphy showed that
her injuries were fatal.
People in the -vicinity of Polk street
r and Ash avenue, shortly after 8
o'clock, were attracted by a woman's
screams and a moment i later were
horrified to see her rush Into the street
enveloped in- flames. Upon reaching the
street ihe unfortunate -woman fell in a
faint. A The crowd that had quickly gath
ered did what it could to help her and
every effort was made to quelch the
flames that were rapidly consuming her
clothing. It was some little time before
the efforts were successful and not, how
ever,' before the woman was horribly
burned on the chest and abdomen.
Mrs. Daisy Attwood, wife of Robert Att
wood, a lineman In the employ of the
telephone company and residing at 2i

home last night by the overturning of a
coal oil lamp. "Death relieved her suffer

That Hadley had plenty of money when
he suddenly left San Francisco is almost
certain. He gave "Mrs. Hadley" $100 on
the morning of the day he disappeared,
and it was his usual custom to carry $200
or $300 with him. While Chief of Detec
tives Seymour will say nothing, -it is un
derstood that he has learned that Hadley
had a large sum of money on deposit at
a well-known bank early in the year and
that this money was drawn out a few
days before the accountant took flight.
â¢ The direction in which Hadley fled ' is
being carefully considered by Captain
Seymour. "When Hadley left Chicago,
fourteen . years ago, he went directly to
Mexico and stayed in that country for
some time. He often spoke of Mexico,
arid it is quite likely that he went to that
republic direct. He was seen at 6 p. m.
on the day of bis disappearance, and an
hour later the New Orleans express of
the coast division of the Southern Pacific
Company departed from the Third and
Townsepd streets depot for Los>Angeles,
El Paso\and other points. It would have
been an easy matter for Hadley to take
the train, get off at El Paso and. enter
Mexico, and from that country go to al
most any other part of the world. Â¦'
The positive statement made by the
cashier of the Examiner on Sunday, Jan
uary 19, that Hadley was not a defaulter
proves that Hadley had some grave rea
son, for suddenly taking flight. He had
not quarreled with the woman who
passed as his wife, and he had plenty of
money. None of his friends or associates
know of any reason, for -his taking flight,
yet on the day of the publication of Nora
Fuller's disappearance and the beginning
of the search for "John Bennett," Had
ley. dropped from sight, leaving all his
personal belongings and abandoning a po
sition he had held at a good salary for
fourteen years. , .
The absolute similarity of the initials
"C. B. H.," on the mattress bought by
"John Bennett," and the initials of Had
ley's known signature is beyond dispute.
Hadley will have much to explain if he is
brought back to San Francisco. .
w. l. fagan' acts strangel y.
Investigation shows that - William L.
Fagan, who Is well known In the
loin, might be a bio to throw some light
on Hadley's movements. Â¦
Fagan was an intimate friend of Had
ley, and his reputation made it' a matter
of surprise that a man of Hadley's stand
ing should be his associate. Fagan re
cently returned from the Philippines and
his statements concerning Hadley ' will
bear careful investigation by the police.
Fagan, while an Inmate of the City and
County Hospital in January, told a^ num
ber of patients that Hadley was his best
friend and had asked him to go to Chi
cago to embark in a newspaper - enter
prise.
Fagan entered the hospital on -January
1 and was discharged at his request on
January 29. A short time before he left
the hospital Fagan- claimed that he had
received a check for $300 from Hadley.
Charles A. Noble, who was in the' hospi
tal in January and who is now. in the
Almshouse, and John Powell, at -present
in the City, and County Hospital, are th<*
men to whom Fagan repeatedly made
statements that Hadley was his intimate
friend. These men also state that Fagan
was visited by a man whose name was
given to them as Hadley by their fellow
patient. : . .' .Â¦ Â¦Â¦>... . .^i~
When Fagan left the hospital; he prom
ised to return to see Noble and Powell
but failed to' do so. -Powell, , two weeks'
ago. while down town, met Â¦- Fagan on
Kearny street and was told that- he Fa
gan, had been in .", St. Mary's - Hospital
Fagan's name cannot be :Â¦ found on the
books of the latter institutfon. ; Â¦
O'NEXL PAYS FAGAN'S BILLS^
Fagan Is well known ; around -.the Bar
bary Coast. He resided: for some months
at the Prescott House.'andhis bills were
paid by another, man/ . The landlord of the
Prescott House says that . Fagran f intro
duced a friend by. the name of O'Neil and
that the latter always , called .and I paid
Fagan's accounts. ., â¢ . , . .
The landlord of 'Â¦ the ''Â¦Â¦ PrÂ»scott ' House
madÂ© the following statement -yesterday :
I Fagan has resided here \ for '. some months
O'Nell ' often called to . see. him > up to a Â¦ week
or two ago. O'Neil claimed to be some one
in authority with the .Western 1 Union Tele
graph Company. He said that he received
money from Fagan's folks.' as they would; not
trust Fagan with the money." O'Nell . alwavs
paid Fagan's bills here. On the 17th'of this
month O'Nell called ' here and said that he
Intended sending Fagan : Into the country and
Fagan went away. O'Js'ell promised to : call
again, but I have not seen him.
No person by the- name of O'Neil : is
known at the offices of - the V Western
Union Telegraph Company as being an
employe of authority. Neither is anyone
of that name employed bv. the Postal Tel
egraph Company, the Telephone Company
or the American District Telegraph Com
pany. , Â¦ Â¦â¢.Â¦Â¦â¢ â Â¦ Â¦; .. .,Â¦Â¦-Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦. : Â¦â¢ Â¦ . . Â¦., :
O'Neil informed the landlord* of the

with 'the construction department of - the

at 607 Market street,, together' with; tho

had theater "passes" in his possession
and that he could secure them from the
cashier of the newspaper on which be
worked, to whom they were sent every
week by the managers of the various the
aters in the city.
CONSIDERABLE interest is being
manifested in the j entertainment
and social to be given Wednesday
night, April 30, at Golden Gate
Hall, 625 Sutter street, for the
benefit of .; the Boys' Drill Corps of the
Church of the Advent. Those who have
tl:e arrangements for the affair in charge
are leaving no stone unturned to make it
an unqualified success, both socially and
financially. A splendid programme will
be rendered by' clever amateur talent.
One of the features of the entertain
ment will .be the representation of the
tragic death scene in "Cleopatra," by
Miss Lillian Newman, a rising young tra
gedienne. She will be supported in the
scene by Miss Eunice Kasten, who also
possesses unusual histrionic' ability. In
addition, the laughable comedy, "A Ve
neered Savage," will be presented by a
strong cast. Miss Ullian M. Quinn will
appear in the title role. Miss.M. B. Mc-
Kay, Frank P. Scully, Walter A.' Radius
and Garner' S. Stenhouse will carry, the
other roles. Wi J. Hynes is on the pro
gramme for a spasm of his sparkling hu
mor and Garner S.- Stenhouse will render
a tenor solo. The Misses Spadina will
render a vocal duet.
Another important point in the evidence
being gathered against Hadley is the fact
that he always drank Old' Crow whisky.
The empty whisky bottle found In the
Sutter street house where Nora Fuller
met her death bore the Old Crow label.
An easy explanation is made of the
fact that Hadley did not draw $1500 he
had in a savings bank in this city when
he took flight.. The rule of that bank re
quires that notice must be given by a de
positor who desires to draw out - certain
amounts. Hadley would have been re
quired to wait for a few. days in order to
receive his deposit, and this shows that
bÂ«: meditated instant flight on January 16
the date of the first publication of Nora
Fuller's disappearance and of the begin-
Dlrig--of the search for "John -Bennett."
Shortly after the discovery of Nora Ful
ler's body the police learned that the
young girl had often displayed "passes"
to the Central and Tivoli tti eaters, ar>d a
search was made in the hope of finding
the person who gave the theater tickets
to the girl. . â¢
It is positively known that Hadley oft*n
BOTTLE IS LINK IN CHAIN.
This statement was made by "Mrs.
Hadley" on Sunday, January 13, three
days after Hadley disappeared ' and eight
days after Nora Fuller left her home.
The facts of this statement were brought
to the woman's notice two days, ago, and
she declared that they were absolutely
true and made when she had no knowl
edge of the disappearnce and death of
Nora Fuller.
HIS HAIR TURNED' WHITE.
The statement made by "Mrs. Hadley"
three days after Hadley disappeared was
as follows:
I am sure that something terrible lias caused
Hadley to drop from sight. He has been act
ing like a crazy man for the past week. I
noticed that his hair was turning white, and
Â¦when I wanted to know the cause he would
say that I was the cause. He could not sleep
at night and took some white powders, a thing
I had never known him to do before in the
year that we were together. A few days be
fore he dropped from eight he took his parents'
pictures from a frame and tore them up.
He did not sleep at borne last Saturday night.
He came home In the afternoon, and just be
fore dinner time, 6 o'clock, he rushed out of
the house and did not even stop to lace up his
shoes. He came home about 7 on Sunday
morning and we did, not go out on Sunday,
though that was our usual habit. That was
thÂ« first Sunday that Hadley had not taken
me out. .
That Hadley was laboring under a great
mental strain for some days previous to
his flight was positively learned from
Carrie Dixon three days after he had dis
appeared. At that time "Mrs. Hadley"
was considerably alarmed at the non-ap
pearance of Hadley at his home on Ellis
street. She sought -the offices of- the Ex
aminer and was told by Hadley's supe
riors that he was probably drinking and
would return in the course of a few days.
The attempt made by the Examiner to
discredit the story of the police that Had
ley might be the' much-wanted "John
Bennett" and to create the belief that he
was missing because he had stolen funds
from, the newspaper office, is negatived
by the positive statement made in Janu
ary by the cashier of the Examiner that
Hadley was not a defaulter. The caehier
ajso asked the companion of Hadley, in
case she heard from the missing man, to
inform him that his position was open to
him whenever he returned.' .. J
Three days after Hadley disappeared,
his companion, who passed as his wife,
was interviewed and asked to give what
ever information she could as to Hadley's
actions. The statements she made at that
time now appear most significant, for the
reason that there was no hue and cry
for Nora Fuller, and the discovery of the
girl's body was not made until February
10, almost three weeks later. Â¦
Investigation shows some startling facts
in â¢ connection with the sudden flight of
Hadley from this city, live days after
Nora' Fuller was last seen alive.
Chief of Detectives Seymour is silent
as to. what evidence is in his possession,
but is bending every energy toward locat
ing Hadley and bringing him back to this
city. Â¦
HADLEY SUFFERED MENTALLY.
These important facts, . together with
other valuable information, secured by
Chief of Detectives Seymour, strengthen
the chain of circumstantial evidence that
is being welded by the energetic head df
the detective force for use in the event
of the arrest of Charles B. Hadley.
ley's Â¦ hair showed signs of turning white
within a week of the day he dropped from
sight; that his actions were those of a
.man under great mental strain, and that
he cried bitterly at times and sought
sleep Ly means of narcotics.
She also stated at the time that Had-
Carrie Dixon, or "Mrs. Hadley," gave
out this information three days after
Hadley disappeared, and she made other
statements that in the light of subse
quent, developments regarding Nora Ful
ler's murder are of the gravest import.:
Charles B. Hadley, the missing account
ant and subscription cashier of the. Ex
aminer, Â¦ who is suspected of. being , im
plicated in the mysterious death of Nora
Eleanor Fuller, did not sleep at his home
on the night of July 11 lasti and fol
lowing the day on which Nora Fuller left
her home to meet . "John Bennett" at .a
downtown restaurant. . . â¢ '

Rivers was arrested last night at his
home. 2146Vi Market street, by Detectives
Tom Gibson and Edward O'Dea. He was
charged at the City Prison with assault to
murder and will be turned over to the
Sheriff of San Mateo County this morning.
According to Rivers* statement, he was
playing cards with a friend when After
gut came in, struck him with his list and
beat him on the head with his revolver,
forcing him behind the bar. where After
g-ut took two shots at him. Rivers re
turned the fire, and his assailant then re
treated. . :Â¦â¢; -<,
Word of the shooting was sent to the
Seventeenth-street Police station and
Detective Graham was detailed on the
case. He was powerless to act in the
matter, as the affair occurred in San Ma
teo County. Word was sent to the Sheriff
of San Mateo County, however. Rivers
was only recently appointed to his posi
tion.
Later the dispute was renewed. Rivers
went behind the bar, drew his pistol and
iired three shots at Aftergut. One in
flicted a slight scalp wound, another
struck the butcher's left hand and a third
landed in his left shoulder. Aftergut did
not attempt to return the lire. He gofout
of the way as quickly as possible, and at
once came into the city. He went to St.
Luke's Hospital, where his wounds were
dressed. Ri\-ers left the scene of the
ehooting soon afterward.
Rivers was in the barroom of the Abbey
Hotel yesterday afternoon when Aftergut
came in. Words at once ensued. Rivers
made a motion as if to draw a pistol, but
Aftergut covered him with his before
Rivers could draw. After a few more
words Aftergut put his pistol away and
the affair was evidently closed.
Aftergrut has been closely watched for
years by the local health inspectors and
officers of the Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Rivers last week
found that Aftergut had had a cow
penned up in his barn for four days, with
out food or water. ' Rivers went before a
Justice of the Peace at Baden and pro
cured a warrant for Aftergrut's arrest, as
the offense was committea in Sau Mateo
County. Aftergut was convicted and
fined.
Samuel Aftergut. a butcher whose place
of business Is jusf over the line in . San
Mateo County, had an altercation with
J. L.. Rivers. a ; health inspector- of the
local Board of Health, in the saloon of the
Abbey House on the Mission Road yester
day attcrnoon. Rivers fired three shots
at Aftergut, all of which took effect, but
none inflicted a serious wound.
