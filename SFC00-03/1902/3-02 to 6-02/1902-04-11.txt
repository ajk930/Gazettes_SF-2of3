a cafe, whereupon the Socialists sacked the establishment, ' exploded a lamp
which set fire to the building and completed its ruin. The flames forced the
rioters to retire.

the War Department to-day and had a
short talk with Secretary Root with rela
tion to the present and future status of
the church in the insular possessions of
the United States, and particularly the
questions which have arisen in connec

to the religious orders.
In the face of the existing vacancy in
the post of Archbishop â¢ of ' Manila there
is no one to speak to the authorities here
upon these / questions, except Bishop
O'Gorman and Mgr. Sbaretti, the latter
fresh from the Vatican. If there were an
Archbishop of Manila the disposition of
the authorities would be to deal with him
directly In the matter, inasmuch as he
would be the one person legally empow
ered to transfer title to the friars' lands,
which are ! nominally held in his name.
But in the absence of such a legal custo
dian at Manila" it may become necessary
for the United States Government to deal
with the Vatican, either directly at Rome,
through Governor Taft, when he returns
to Manila from the United States, or here
at Washington, through some of the pre

Senator :Carmack' questioned General
MacArthur 'as to his meaning when he
stated- in his report of 1901 that there was
an organized and systematic effort to
have Chinese immigration, continued for
the purpose of exploiting the Islands.
General MacArthur said: he had intend
ed to bring out the fact that the large
European and American â¢ planters in the
islands all demand Chinese ' labor,* as the
Chinaman is the cheapest and most: in
defatigable ' laborer in. the -world. Their
hope was; he -said, to continue the flood
of immigration from China,' as they Were
reluctant to come to Xthe American stan
dard of .wages. He~did not believe it

out, and he was of the opinion that when

U tt EALDSBURG. April .10.â The
[ â i I golden wedding aniversary Â¦ of
I I Mr. and Mrs. John W_ Clack,
il 11. prominent residents of this city,
was celebrated Tuesday in an
interesting and impressive manner.
The venerable couple "are among His
very few' remaining Mendocino \, County
pioneers. . Mrs. Clack is a native of Mis
souri, where her ' birth occurred' October
31, 1S33. John Wood Clack is a Ken
tuckian and was born May 24, 1831. The
marriage took place In Jackson County,

WASHINGTON, April 10.â The debate
on the Cubcn reciprocity bill in the House
to-day was devoid of enlivening features.
The most notable speech of the day was
made by Grosvenor of Ohio. He declared
that DIngley opposed the sugar schedule
of the DIngley bill on the ground that It
was unreasonably high, and that he tad
only been induced to, acquiesce in It in
the expectation that "the tariff on sugar
would be used to promote reciprocity.
He said with 'great : emphasis that . he
had never yet permitted himself to . wor
â¢5 hip the tarffT system, aa 1 a feOch not to
be touched or examined: He warned the
young Republicans about him that If tney
believed tne present tariff schedule were
to be forever defended they had as well
retire . tV private life. The: Republican
party, he "announced, must not cha.n.it-.
self to tariff schedules. : He declared that
the Republican party dared, not in 189t>
pledge itself to the re-enactment .a. tne
McKinley bilL It was not a question ol
schedules, but of protective principle..
\ He predicted that the time would Â¦ come
.when there -would te an inexorable ae
mand for changes In the present sched
ules, but that it had not yet come, we;
warned his Republican colleagues who
were opposing the present bill ana^wno
proposed to overturn the rulings or tne
chair to accomplish its defeat that they
might -plunge the whole country Into ,&
"premature agitation for a revision of
the tariff." *v
With some feeling Grosvenor tneo
answered the charges of Inconsistency
brought against himself. He called atten
tÂ«on to 'the remarks on reciprocity made
by President Roosevelt at Charleston
yesterday, which . he described "the best
speech the President ever made, and
humorously remarked that he wonaerea
at the temerity in making such state
ments while Republicans in the House
were denouncing such sentiments as
I party disloyalty. The present tariff on
raw sugar, he declaraed, was higfc be
yond all reason. If the 20 per cent re
duction were made the tariff on sugar
would then be '5 per cent higher than the
framers of the Dingley bill intended. If
the beet-sugar people had an industry
that could not stand against the world
with H 40 a hundred protection then it
would better be abandoned. , . 1
In conclusion Grosvenor denied tnat
the pending bill constituted an assault
upon the protective theory. He said that
96 per cent of the people of the country
favored it because they did not believe
Cuba should be. treated so harshly, that
she would be forced into the Union.-; â¢
-Weeks of Michigan followed .Grosvenor
with a speech in opposition to the bill.
He argued that there was no obligation
upon us to aid Cuba. â¢ V . -' ,' r^r^
Lawrence *of Massachusetts, said his
chief reason for supporting' the bill wa3
that the United Spates owed a moral ob
ligation to grant Cuba this relief. .
Thayer of Massachusetts took advan
tage of the latitude allowed in general
debate to discuss his resolution which
called on the Attorney General for infor
mation as to what steps, if any, had been
*taken to investigate .certain published
charges of the existence of ; a meat com-
Price of Illinois pointed out what the.
â¢United States had done for Cuba and-de
clared that if there was a moral obliga
tion to enact this legislation for Cuba's
benefit, which he. dfnied,' the- conditions
in the island did ndt justify tt-.- Ha. in
sisted that the conditions In the Island
had been misrepresented; and saidl^that
Cuba this year produced more "sugar ; than
she had for years and that the price of
labor there to-day .was higher than it
was in the Northwestern States. : Price
said the present bill was more of a Dem
ocratic than a Republican measure. -

Governor Taft also said that while | ' in
his testimony he had produced reports
from Governors of twenty-three organ
ized provlncesVhe had "expressly limited
them to those in which there wa3 no In
surrection." True, Tayabas had not
been turned over to the- military author
ities, but the writ of habeas corpus had
been suspended there in the case of mili
tary nrisoners. He added that he - had "
promised only to submit reports .from
pacified provinces, and that, in accordance
with this promise, .he had submitted "all
such reports received. Hence he asserted
that he had not disobeyed the rules of the
committee. . ' .
Commenting upon these explanations. of
Governor Taft Senator Culberson read
from the record of the Governor's testi
mony before the committee where he 'had
said, after submitting the twenty-three
reports referred to, that it was "quite
possible there might -be in the mall other
reports," and that If so he would pro
duce them. -Senator Culberson also said
that no claim had been imade that Ta
yabas was not an organized province and
that it" was evident that Governor Taft
had been In possession of the report
concerning that province when he wa3
before the committee.
"I am willing to submit to the record,'
said Senator Culberson, "whether Gov
ernor Taft was entirely, candid and "Â¦ qia^

General Mac Arthur was again the wit
ness before the committee to-day, and he
began his statement with reference to, the
burning of villages by the native forces
In 1899. He said* that the order for this
destruction had been Issued by General
Lur.a, and he found that this was due .to
the fact that Luna had been a student of
Napoleon's campaigns, and had conceived
the Idea that he could, compel the Ameri
can forces to retreat as the Russians had
forced the French conqueror to retreat
from Moscow. > In this connection General
MacArthur read a i number; of orders Â¦ in
the field and enjoining the utmost kind
ness in the treatment of . captured "' and
wounded members of the enemy's forces.
* In one of these orders ' the r American
fcrces were instructed to' kill if possible
the enemy . with arms in Â¦ his possession,
and in reply to questions General 'Mac-
Arthur said that in war the prime object
is to disable the enemy. and to kill him
if possible when in battle. >. To the â¢ good

AS EXPLAINED r BY TAFT.
"The attitude of the army, thereby
meaning most of Its officers and soldiers,
is, however, decidedly, hostile to the. prOr
vincial and municipal- governments in thla
province and' to- civil government in these
islands in -seneral. In Manila especially
it Is intensely so, even among the higher
officers. The work of the commission in
the establishment of provincial govern
ments is ridiculed even in the presence
of the natives. It is openly stated, that
the army should remain in charge for :the
next, twenty years. Outrages committed
by- officers. and soldiers against -natlvÂ«s~-in
an organized municipality - and province,
when reported by the Presidente or-Giiv
ernor, to the military authorities; are
often not punished. This; in my opinion,
is unfortunate, because, loyal natives i be
gin to fear that local self-government
promised them will not last long, and that
any slight disturbance in a province may
at any time be made the pretext to again
place It under military rule, and this is
Just the thing the Insurgents at heart
most desire. . â¢.-.â¢,." : '.'. Â¦' .Â¦
"It has been stated that a Filipino or
an . Oriental does not appreciate Just_br.
kindly treatment and that he considers it
an evidence of weakness und- that severe
and - harsh measures are the* onlv- ones
that are admittedly effective with Fili
pinos. I have found ' that just and kind
treatment, uniform and continued, is the
only way by which' these people can. be
come our friends and satisfied With United
States sovereignty. , Â¦â¢ ;!Â¦":_
"Having been stationed six years on the
Rio Grande, I ; am â¢ well - acquainted ..- with
the natives of Mexico, and while in the
province of Santa Clara, Cuba I visited
every town in that province and was able
to observe the intelligence, and education
there: I believe that the people of'.Tay
abas province are in every way superior
in education, Intelligence, morals and civ
ilization to the people of the State of
Tamaulipas, Mexico, or Santa Clara.' .. .
"As an officer of the army I : regret. that
my . duty as civil governor 1 of this; pro
vince impels me to state the attitude^ of
the majority of my fellow officers toward
civil government in the islands and^lts
effect upon the people, but I feel that the
interests of the Government as involved
in the future of these, people, for whose
welfare we are responsible, are of .such
vast importance that I ought to -report
things as I see and know them. In /order
that my civil superiors may be able In
telligently to order what the situation de
mands." - . i. '.-' .-. '
OEDEREB TO, INVESTIGATE.;
With the report is a copy of a letter
by General Corbin to General Chaff ee
dated February 19, saying he Incloses the
report of Major Gardener, and that thero
should be a complete investigation. There
also is a cable message dated April 2 in
which General Chaffee is directed to make
the . investigation with all speed possible.
In connection with the report Secretary
Root also forwarded to tne committee a
telegram from Governor Taft, dated at
Cincinnati on the 8th inst., in which, he
said: . . .-.::Â¦â¢ ' . : ; :.
i "This report was handed to my ' secre
tary just before- r sailed from Manila.
On reaching Washington I submitted It to
Secretary Root, with 'the statement that
Colonel Gardener was successful as mili
tary commander at Tayabas in keeping
it peaceful; that he was a good Gov
ernor and was popular with the people,
and that I would believe implicitly any
thing stated of his knowledge, but,* I
feared that the great friction between
him and those officers, succeeding him in,
military command had so Influenced his
Judgment that charges made by 'him,
necessarily based on evidence of others,,
against the conduct of military affairs in
the provinces ought not to be acted Â¦ on
without giving those accused an oppor
tunity to be heard, and that, had I. read
the report before leaving Manila, v- 1
should have referred It to General Chaf
fee for Investigation and comment. The
Secretary of War accordingly directed. me
to transmit the same to him for the pur
pose of forwarding it to General Chaffee,
and I did so under date of February 17."

KIDNET TROUBLE, LAME
BACK AND RHEUMATISM
CURED BY SWAMP-ROOT.
To Prov^ What the Grsat Kidney Remedy, Swamp-
Root, Will Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Call
May Hays a Sample Bottle Sent Free by Mail.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 29, 190L
DR. KILMER & CO., Binghamton, N. Y. , ,
â¢ Gentlemen: It ffives me great pleasure to add ray testimonial to that of hun-
dreds of others regarding the wonderful curative properties ; of Swamp-Root. I
had a lame back three years ago before leaving North Dakota for the ' coast.
Soon after my arrival in the Puget Sound country, it became very much worse.
I felt certain that the coast climate had given me acute rheumatism and came
to the conclusion that I could net live in this climate. Later I became con-
vinced that what I really had was kidney trouble, and that the rheumatism was
due to my kidney trouble. The lameness in mv back increased rapidly and I
had other symptoms which indicated that I would soon be prostrated unless I ob-
tained relief quickly. Noticing your oiler of a sample bottle of Swamp-Root,
frpe, I had a friend write for one and began taking it immediately. Within
three weeks the lameness in my back began to disappear. During that fall and
winter I took three one-dollar bottles of Swamp-Root, with the result that I be-
came completely cured. I no longer have pains in my back and can exercise vio-
lently without feeling any bad effects. I have recommended Swamp-Root to sev-
eral cf my ac<juaintanc<?s who were similarly affected and without exception they
have been greaUy 'benefited by its use. Yours very truly.

Lame back is only one symptom of kidney troubleâ one of manyâ and Is na-
ture's timely warning to show you fthat the track of health, is not clear.
If these danger signals are unheeded, more serious results are sure to follow;.
Bright s Disease, which is the worst form of kidney trouble, may steal upon you.
The great kidney remedy. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, is used in the leading

; NAPA, April 10.â Mrs. Jacob Baumann,
a guest 1 : at. Napa: Soda' Springs, a resort
seven miles from this city, was the victim
of, a - horrible' accident at that Â¦ place
W^ednesday night. by being fatally^ burned
in flames': which 1 ignited her clothing. ,
Â¦ The unfortunate; woman was supposed
to have been carrying a candle, which
she dropped, and this probably set fire
to^ her clothes. The accident occurred
about 8 o'clock and. Mrs. Baumann lived
until 4Vo'clock\Thursday. morning, when
death ended. her sufferings. . . , ' - , Â¦ / .
"Mrs. Baumann was the wife of a promi
nent merchant- of San Francisco and aged
Boyears." She cajne.to the springs about a
weekago".forher:health and wasaccom-'
panled.;by her physician./ Dr. A. S. . D:
Faschlan. She,: hail /apartments in the
T3ellevue building at the Springs. Wednes
day - evening jj she : was ' apparently in â¢ the
best of spirit^ and went down to the din
ing hall f or ; her dinner, T something she
was not always able, to ".do. At the con
clusion of a hearty, repast, she returned
to her rooms at the -Bellevue.
About 8 o'clock; as- Dr. Paschlan was
enjoying, the evening air. on the .veranda,
piercing.- cries- -for,- help and agonizing
Bhrieks suddenly came from, within the
building. The outcry was heard all over
the place and. every one. rushed to the
spot, .fearing that >Â¦ the :iarge hotel was
afire, 'for a bright, light could be seen
through the windows -and doorway. . '
. Dr. Faschlan .was, the first on. the scene
and there In the main hallway, a'few feet
from the entrance,' he- found ' Mrs. Bau
mann writhing .on- the floor in a mass of
flames. He hastily . threw his overcoat
over her. and rushed Into a bedroom for
blankets I and spreads. Mrs. Charles H.
Jackson, who was nearby, hurried in and
bundled about the unfortunate woman the
heavy cloak she was wearing. . Mrs. Bau
mann's clothing,' even to her. shoes, was
entirely consumed and her body -was com
pletely blistered, being charred in many
places. â¢ . < â¢
How the fire which caused the. fatality
originated was at. first a mystery, but it'
was learned this afternoon that before
she died Mrs. Baumann told Dr. Faschlan
that she had dropped the candle she was
carrying In the' toilet-room and had picked
it up again. It doubtless brushed against
her skirts, j

ALL. 'BUREAU, 1406 G STREET.
/f ' N.'W., WASHINGTON, April 10.
1L â¢â President Roosevelt's speech at
Charleston last night, In which
: : : '. ; . he said that' trusts, If they work
at .-ill, must work under the law,. has at
tracted wide attention at , the capital and
< is regarded, by many public men as a di
rect shot'at the beef trust. . .
. There is general approvalof his sfate- u
ment: :'The nation , should exercise .over
combinations j cautiously," but jj flrmly, the
power, of supervision and regulation." -
-Repres'cntatlye RlchaÂ»dson, leader of the
'minority in the House, said of the Presi
dent's reference ; to trusts : "That is good
Democratic doctrine and if. the President
wishes any assistance in. the line, he sug
gests he can. count on I every :, member of
i the Democratic party in Congress. The
worst of all of these trusts at present. Is
the beef trust, and we shall push the reso
lution now pending in. the House. with all
of our force." ; ., '^"',,' "-.â¢-.-
Senator Patterson" said: '.'I ; believe in
the -widest publicity in all of these mat
ters. If the charges against the beef trust
are well founded, as no doubt they are," It
cannot be - * . omclally Â¦'- investigated too
qulokly." '. : Â¦'Â¦'.'Â¦ '"Â¦Â¦Â¦' ' -'â¢,':
. Representative IMcClellan aÂ«id: . "If the
President, means the beef tru'st, or any
other harmful combination in his speech,
he will get all of the assistance he, needs
from the Democrats."
Representative Sulzer said: VThe beef
trust- Is the meanest of all the trusts and
affects every/, citizen in the. land. The
men in this combination to >rob the poor
are engaged in an atrocious .conspiracy,
and should be prevented: by the Attorney;
General of the United States and the At
torneys General of -all the- States whieS"
have enacted -anti-trust laws. The beef
trust Is violating the i United States anti
trust laws and the anti-trust law of the
State of New York. The proof, is conclu
sive and;the officials should be forced by
public oolnion to do their duty. I- 'am
heartily in favor of Thayer's resolution.
It will receive my support.". - .
Representative Underwood said: "lam
heartily In. sympathy with Thayer's reso
lution.,;! think of < all trusts the one that
Is the most, dangerous is one that con-'
trols food products, and that it is the
duty of Congress to Investigate the mat
ter at once and give the relief needed."
. SUMMERVILLE. S. C, April 10.â The,
visit of'Presldent Roosevelt and party to'
the South terminated here to-dav. , No
special programme I .had been . arranged.
When the President came Â¦ down "stairs
this morning he held an informal recep-'
tion In the hotel parlors and shortly, after-'
.ward, accompanied by most of hi3 party,
was taken for a drive to Dorchester, ' tlio
site .of the old Spanish fort. â¢:,.
The tea farm. of Dr. Shepherd, not far.
from the Inn, was next- visited, . and" as
the President alighted from his carriage
a number of .diminutive negro pickers
lined up in front of Dr. Shepherd's house
and sang the "Star-Spangled Banner."
"America" and other patriotic airs.
The President thanked them. The ar-,
rival at. the tea farm was later' than had
been-planned and the stay was brief,- but
the President saw enough of the industry
to cause him. to congratulate Dr. Shepherd
on the work he is doing and to. wish him
every success. The party was then driven
direct to the Southern station, where the
special train was in waiting. A company
of marines who had acted es th'.- Presi
dent's guard while at Charleston and' here
were lined on the station platform. ;
\The President thanked the"nv for .their
services and expressed his . recret that
thoy had . not participated in the ; Prince
Henry* cerrmonies because, he said, he
was sure they â¢ would have made a tine
appearance. The train pulled out for
Washington amid the cheers and hurrahs
of an immense crowd which had- gathered
at the station. Through ; .the>?te.ivns that
the Presidential train 'passed. onTttus, return
journey crowds of cheering .-.people lined
the tracks to catch a glimpse -'of â¢--Roose
velt. -â¢ /â¢Â¦.' ;;:;^prr;
At Branchville, S. C.,. a small station on
the Southern Railway, where .a; stop was
made for water, the President . came out
on the 'rear platform and bowed his ac
knowledgments to '; the 300. people who
rushed for hi3 car and cheered ihim. Al
though no stop was made at' Orangeburg.
fully 1C00 persons Â¦ were ' .. -waiting - for . the
train. A crowd, had gathered at the de
pot at Columbia and- there was a rush for
the President's car. In the crowd .were a
number of students of the ', South .- Caro
lina College, who gave ; a â¢ strong , college
yell. When a semblance of order was re
stored the President, who had been stand
ing on the platform with Mr,s. N tRoosevelt,
made a short speech. .-.-;. -
' In the handshaking which 'â¢ followed the
President noticed the jamming and push
ing going 1 1 on, and \ when , he r grasped the
outstretched hand of a little girl and said
he was partial to children because he had
a half dozen of them himself. Following
is his speech in full:
, Ladies and" Gentlemen: I thank you most
heartily for your courtesy In coming forward
to greet me .this afternoon, and It is only on*
of the expressions of Invariable courtesy with
Â¦which I have been treated while In your great
State. I have enjoyed every moment of the
three days I have been down. here. I think I
was a pretty pood American when I came down,
but I am a 'better American as I leave your
borders, and let me, In closing, ask. you to
support ; to the best of- your ability the expo
sition in Charleston. I ask that . not only of
you.^but of all the people In the Union. It is a
grand tribute to the energy, the forethought
and the business enterprise of the people of
Charleston that they have planned and built so
beautiful an exposition ' and they deserve all
the help they can possibly have In it. I wish
them well, I wish you well, and I thank you
for the way: you have received me. . '-- :,;.
Wlnnsboro and Chester, S. C, turned
out immense crowds.. At the latter place,
where a # brief stop was made, the Presl-
dent appeared on .the rear platform.
There was a loud call for Mrs. Roosevelt,
When she came out of her car on the plat
form a mighty shout went up. The Presi
dent responded to the request for a speech
as follows:
Ladles and Gentlemen: I want to thank
you. I want to thank the people of both
the Carolina* for the reception I have met
with to-day, and during the two preceding days.
I have appreciated to the fullest extent thÂ«
hospitality oi'the people of Charleston and
marveled at the beautv of their exposition.
The. welcome that has been extended to me In
your State will be an inspiration in my public
life, and I shall endeavor, men and women of
this State, so to conduct myself always that
yon and all other Americans shall have reason
to be satisfied with the way your affairs are
managed. I thank you heartily and wish you
well. I only hope that you have enjoyed har-
Ins me here- half as much aa I have enjoyed
bÂ»lngr here.. v ; Â¦Â¦..":
The 750 students and others at the Wln
throp Female- Academy at Rock Hill had
requested ' the; President to stdp there if
possible-,-. and when the train came In
sight the- whole town was out. No stop
was made, ' but the President gave them
an opportunity to see him by coming out
on the platform as the train sped by.
SALISBURY. N. C April 10.â The first
stop in the Tarheel State was at Char
lotte. The J demonstration there was no
less enthusiastic and hearty than In the
Palmetto State. The President was
forced to' make ; a speech," In which he
said: â¢ .Y. ,: V- ; -Â¦" Â¦- /.*-..
"I am very glad to have the chance of
greeting you to-night, to say how much
L appreciate your -having, come."
- "How about the -Mecklenburg declara
tlon?; 1 '.' â¢ ; \ â¢â¢ --â¢â¢-â¢ .-"-Â¦
, The Presldent-^The'MecTdenburg declar
ation was all rij?h.t/ ' ;'
', Then,, after a pause: "Some one In *ho
audience has spoken of the Mecklenburg
declaration. . That was the flrat declara
tion of independence in what are now the
United States. To my good fortune, I
have studied much of the early history of
North Carolina. I know the part yoa
played In , .the revolution; the part you
played even during the revolution in win
ning the great West for the republic. I
feel that you deserve to be called in a
peculiar sense Americans of America and
no higher praise than that can be given
in our country. I have appreciated great
ly the greetings I have received, not
merely . in South Carolina, but from the
representatives of vour State Â»who were
there also. It has been to me a privilege
to meet you. I Yesterday I reviewed your
National Guard at the Charleston Expo
sition. It was a Â¦ pleasure : to be able Â¦ to
see them. ,1 have served .with some of
your men. for some men born In this
State were in my regiment. On one oc
casion I had to choose twenty sharpshoot
ers. Two of , them were North Carolln
ans." * . .-.Â¦â¢-
Here the train started, and the Presi
dent, concluding, said: "I thank you- and
wish you all good luck." ,

the ranks of .-.the "regulars''- at
Oakland yesterday, the attendance .being
unusually large. The "picnickers" were
disappointed to a certain exte'nt, for Mil
dred Schultz, a SO to 1 chance, proved the
one successful outsider, all the other
events falling to first choices In the ring.
.. Nothing on the bill of fare looked eo
difficult to solve as the Crescendo handi
cap over one mile and a, furlong, with six
acceptances. Obia 102 ahd Antolee 103
finally closed* about equal choices, with
Position and MacGyle the next 'most fan
ckd. The solution of the perplexing
problem did not appear eo hard, as
Ransch on Obia went out In the lead at
tho. etart, and, setting a clip thatsent
Bragg to an early grave, won by a length
from Position In 1:54. Had Hoar on the
, latter horse kept closer up In the early
stages of the running, instead of falling
lengths out of it, he must have finished
first. Larry Daly apparently could not
keep MacGyle straight in , the stretch,
finishing a close third. Aiitolee retired
after doing active picket duty on the
, firing line.
True Blue had nothing to beat in the
opening: sprint, and at prohibitive odd*
palloped home first with Troxler. Cau

Park summary: -â¢ .:Â¦"â¢
So there were three sets' of -locations
piled . up, one " on top of another. >The
claims at -the eighteen-foot level and the
ones ten^feet below had already been sold
for cash. 1 -The purchasers... were somewhat
excited when they found. the blazlnes at
four feet from the ground. 'Whether such
conditions will be ; . found t at Thunder
Mountain Is unknown. Thetstory is told
only- for the .purpose of making mining
men careful."' . ;'.?Â¦' : i. v -
Up to. that time, aside from the imme
diate neighborhood of the original dis
covery, practically no locations had been
made and there were few persons in the
district. Considering that .the weather
has been severe, it is taxing credulity to
ask people on the outside to believe that
a few prospectors have made 7000 valid lo
cations, when it is necessary to ! sink, a
shaft ten feet deep on each location.
Concerning the Buffalo Hump discover
ies, a few years ago, the tales were as
alluring as are those of the present.
When the first rush 1 came In. the spring
and a clean up was made of the claims. It
was â¢Â¦ discovered . that . trees.' above -the
eighteen feet of snow â which is 'about the
depth also - for the Thunder Mountain
country â had been; blazed and marked as
locations and corner: monuments. Jf ,the
tree was not too big the top was cut off
and the stump was squared down to a
corner post. But, when the eighteen feet
of . snow had. melted, It wa^s. discovered
that the same tracks had also been blazed
ten feet ' farther down, showing that, an
earlier- location had^ been, made. -'When
the snow -melted more it , was discovered
that "the same trees were marked for lo
cation purposes, at a height of four feet
above the- ground. â¢ Â¦â¢ Â»
â¢ Thunder. Mountain, as a- matter of fact,
is at;the top of the most inaccessible part
of Idaho. V The number of claims must be
greatly- exaggerated, for the discoveries
were made only just before Â»the snows last
winter began to pile up in the mountains.
There are some, stories ' that aro- - told
about Thunder Mountain that are; easily
open to question. One' Idaho journal has
asserted that there are already 7000 loca
tions, at Thunder Mountain and that al
most every foot of ground for a radius of
seven mllÂ«>s~ In every 1 direction from the
mountain has been staked out into mining
claim, locations..- â¢ : ; \ 'Â¦ , . . " 'o . Â¦ Â¦ . j ...
' Caswell ' Bros. Â¦. have made some money
from their discoveries and one of the pic
tures' accompanying the ; map is a scene
illustrating the interior of their cabin,, in
which there has .been; several thousands
of -dollars in gold dust at a time. If it
is reported that there is $10,000,000 in sight,
as Curran eays.or if there are vast stores
of wealth in underground works, It is still
unnecessary to caution California miners
not to lose their heads,' for the majority
of them have learned wisdom by experi
ence: ] ' . V
Identical. with that of Cripple Creek. The
ore Is reported to be good for free mill
ing. Professor. E. H: Mead Is -quoted as
saying that "ore can be quarried out on
the same principle as at "the Homestake
of the Black Hills and- the Treadwell
mines of Alaska.'' Martin Curran is also
quoted to the effect that the principal
vein stands up 100 feet above the surface
on the: westerly end; and 150 feet above
the surface on tho easterly end. Then
there are figures concerning the exposed
pay ore, which Is estimated by Curran
In the millions of dollars.

Great Danger in Buying Snow-Cov

Thunder Mountain now holds a large
share of attention because of the lata
gold discoveries made there. The I moun
tain is in the came general section as
the Buffalo Hump country in Idtiho, , in
Â¦which gold- discoveries were made several
years ago. Thunder Mountain ' district
has been known to be gold-bearing for
some years. It did not become prominent

were made by the Caswell brothers that

more or less true, have been told about

According to the correspondent of The
Call at Boise, Idaho, there are five routes
into the country, which start respectively
at Boise, Weiser, Ketchum, Salmon City
and Lewiston. All the starting points are
reached by the railroad, excepting Sa 1 .-.

Red Rock, . Mont., the last named place
being on the railroad. The distance from
the enumerated railroad points to' the
mines varies from 20 to 150 miles. .;

told about the district are very alluring.
How much of truth' and what share of
fiction these narratives contain cannot
very well be ascertained at this time.
Truth and fiction invariably Jostle , one
another whenever a new gold camp is

on a charge 01 grand larceny. The al

"I answered; an ad in a. morning .paper
asking for a you'ner man. with' a few dol
lars to invest. in a scheme- which, it v.as
promised, would yield large profits. In
1 answer to my letter Martin -J*. Lane
called at my house and- told me of a
friend of his named Sutton who was deal
ing faro for the United Turf Association
at the Palace Hotel. He told me that
Sutton had a ranch and a stud of thor
oughbred horses in Kentucky, on whclh
v there- was a mortgage of 51000. Lane said
that Sutton had 5S000 coming to him
as his interest in the faro game, and that
he was 'sore' at the association because
his request for an- advance of $1000 had
been refused. He aÂ£ked me if I would
play against the game and 'pkln the
' outfit.' 1 agreed And drew $1700 I had on
. deposit with the Canadian Bank of Com
merce. 1 met him at the Grand Hotel and
i v.as introduced to Sutton, who preceded
vis to the Palace. When Lane and I got
to the rooms he knocked at the door and
was admitted by giving the signal, which
was that 'we were two guests from Sar
stcga.'
Â¦ "I was to play . under instructions,
which was to play on the card turneÂ«i by
Sutton when he blew his nose vigorously.
Well, he didn't blow his nose very often,
and when he did my winnings were
small. At the end of the evening I was
broke, and all I got for my money was
I en assurance that Sutton was sorry, 'that
the cards did not break right.' "

Broad's blows had much steam behind
them and shook Attell up when they

RESULTS OF THURSDAY'S EVENTS AT OAKLAND TRACK
George Humphreys told a strange story
yesterday to Coroner Leland and the po
lice concerning his roommate, I. G. Wen
rick, who was found ' dead In bed at
15 Edd>t street on March 15. Although
the man had not been attended by a
physician, and it was his first night: in
the lodging-house, no inquest was held.
The stomach was sent. to the City.Chem
ist for" analysis, and, no poison being
foundV Weririck's death was entered on
the Â¦ Morgva records as - due .to . natural
â¢ Mr. " Humphreys Vaid" "that Wenrick haÂ« v
beeii : sleW, 7 * despondent^ and out', of em
ployment for a. long, time and had often
threatened suicide. On the day preced
ing TVenrick's death, Wenrick showed
him a powder, for which he said he had
paid a clairvoyant .and palmist on Market
street $10, and a pawn ticket for a watch.
The powder >as a poison guaranteed to
leave no trace of itself alter twelve hours.
He said' that the poison was used by
photographers, and that he bought some
for 25 cents at a drug store. Humphreys
took it awav from' Wenrick by force, but
upon -his friend saying that he would buy
some more, he let him have it. V. enrick
was anxious to avoid the disgrace which
attaches to the: name of a suicide, his ;
brother being a Baptist clergyman at
Bradford, Ohio. Humphreys told this
storv to Eli J. Wilkinson, his landlord,
at 2144 Union street. All that Wenrick
would tell him about the composition
of the poison was that it was a cyanide
of potassium â¢ preparation used by pho
tographers.
Dr. Wheeler of 1007% Market street is
said by Humphreys to be the man who
gave the poison prescription to Wenrick.
Wheeler emphatically denies all connec
tion with the case.

lahan and Eugene W. Kay.'
George Collins is attorney for Dlm
xnick and Bert Schlesinger and United
States District Attorney Wood-worth are
prosecuting the case in behalf of the
Government.
John \V. Wilkie. chief qf the United
States Secret Service; W. 'J. Byrnes, a
member of the bureau and conceded to
be one of the shrewdest secret service
men in the country; and John P. Bergln,
safe and lock expert -of the Government;
came here from Washington to give tes
timony in the case.
-Â¦=Â¦-. - â¢ Openings Statement.
At the afternoon session Mr. Schles
inger made the opening statement for
the prosecution. In part, he said:
May it please the court and you, gentlemen |
of the Jury, the Indictment In this case charges
the defendant with having on the 1st day of
July. 1901. stolen from the United States Mint
ct San Francisco the sum of $30,000. The in
dictment consist* of three counts, but all these
three counts relate to the same transaction.
The first count chances the crime of larceny.
The 'second and third charge the crime of em
bezzlement. But you will understand, gentle
men of the Jury, that there is only one charge
against this defendant of having stolen the
$30,000.
We will show you, gentlemen of the Jury,
that on the 29th day of June, 1901. the amount
of cash on hand in the Mint was found to be
$30,000 short in double eagles. The evidence
will Indicate that this shortage was attributed
to an error In bookkeeping, but in order to
make absolutely certain how this shortage oc
curred a complete count of all the money in
the vault not under seal was had. and the fact
that the shortage occurred In the cashier's vault
was absolutely established. The books will
ehow, gentlemen of the Jury, that a. crime was
committed, namely, th* crime of larceny, and
the proofs will show that the only person who
could commit that crime was a person having J
access to the cashier's vault. The proofs will
ehow that the crime charged in this indictment
could not be committed vy any outsider, and
further, gentlemen of the Jury, the evidence
will demonstrate clearly that this crime could
only have been committed by some employe of
the Mint who had access to the cashier's de
partment. The cashier's vault is able to hold
$6,000,000. but we will ehow you that on ac- '
count of the large amount of money on band
the bags were stacked.
Dimmick Manipulated Locks.
We will show you that Mr. Dimmlck had
been seen manipulating the time lock; that it
was his duty to count the cash in the cashier's
vault every day and be was required to make
to the Superintendent of the Mint a written re
port of the amount of cash on hand, and we
will show you that Mr. Cole entered the cash
ier's vault and checked the figures in his books;
that Mr. Dimmick. In pursuance of his duty,
would go into the vault, would pretend to
count the number of bags contained in the
plgepn-holea, and that every day he reported
that all the money called for by tha cashier's
books was Intact.
We will show you, gentlemen of the Jury,
that Mr. Dimmlck was seen leaving the Mint
on more than one occasion between the months
cf January 1901. and June, 1901. the three or
four months preceding the discovery of the loss,
after business hours carrying a dress suit case.
We will show you, gentlemen of the Jury, that
when Mr. Dimmlck was asked whether he had
Â«. dress suit case, whether lie ever had - a dress
suit case in the Mint, that he stated constantly
that he sever owned a dress suit case aad never
owned one or ever had one at the Mint.
We will show you . that Mr. - Dimmlck en
deavored by various ways and means to fasten
the crime on his fellow-employe."" the cashier
of the Mint, when he was asked to account for
the disappearance of those six bags of coin;
that he made a large number of statements
tending to indicate â to his superior officers that
Sir. Cole was the man who had stolen the $30.
000. We will chow you that he made false
accusations against Cole; that be was short-
In his cash and In a systematic and studious
way he attempted to avert suspicion from him
self and fasten it upon the cashier. : Mr. Cole.

A WOMAN'S BACK"
The Aches and Pains Will Disappear
if the Advice of This San Fran- -
dseo Citizen Is Followed.
A> woman's back has many aches and
pains.
Most times 'tis the kidneys' fault. _
Backache Is really kidney ache.
That's why Doan's Kidney Pills cure It.
Many San Francisco women know this.
Read what one has to say about It:
Mrs. Patrick Reardon (Patrick Rear-
don. contractor for sewers, - etc.), resi-
dence 219 Hayes street, says: "Before I
went to the Owl Drug Store. 112& Market
street, for Doan's Kidney Pills I had ex-
hausted all my knowledge of urinary
household makeshifts and tried remedy
after remedy guaranteed to cure attacks
of backache, but I was unsuccessful in
procuring anything 1 to give lasting relief.
My back ached' sometimes so severely
tiiat I could not rise from a chair for
hours at a time and' when in this condi-
tion it was Just as painful to move
around. Doan's Kidney Pills absolutely
Etopped the last attack. I now. know
what to use should others recur."

Owing to the strife between American and, Cana
dian officials at the disputed, point the Joint High
Commission appointed to settle the. dispute agreed
upon a temporary line to- be respected by both sides
pending the final settlement. That agreement is now
in force, but the Canadians have surveying parties at
work busily engaged in an effort to carry the Cana
dian line nearer to the sea. : It is hardly likely that
the official representatives of a great nation 'would
deliberately destroy or falsify evidence in a case
of this kind by removing an ancient landmark, ; but
the charge is not incredible. Canada has been by -no
means" scrupulous ; in pressing her pretensions aloiitr
The issue has become. important because of the
growing wealth of the ; . Yukon territory and the
Alaskan shore line. A strip of country which before
-the discovery of the Klondike goldfields was deemed
of little or no value by either. nation has now be
come sufficiently important to be the subject of se
rious'contention. The point at issue is to determine
whereÂ»the boundary line ran between the British and
the Russian possessions before we purchased Alaska.
Canada, in a not unnatural eagerness to get posses
sion of a seaport for. her Klondike country, has made
extraordinary Â¦ claims of the extent , of her .territory,
along the disputed line and has repeatedly committed
aggressions upon territory that is indisputably ours.
If any old Russian monuments remain to mark the
line before the' controversy began they would be of
the highest value in the of the con
troversy, and consequently the "removal of such a
monument by an official Canadian survey party would
be a very serious offense ' indeed. .
RICHARDSON of the army and
I Lieutenant Emmons of the navy have been
appointed by President Roosevelt as a com
mission to investigate the report that a monument
erected by Russia to mark, her boundary line in
Alaska has been arbitrarily removed by an' official
surveying expedition of the Canadian Government.
The story, which was published in The Call some
time ago, has been regarded in Washington as suffi
ciently well authenticated- and serious to merit im
mediate attention, and it is believed it will lead to
negotiations for the final settlement of the boun
dary controversy. '%<$*.$Â¦

This is a great work, begun with a race recently

When endowments are being donated to institu
tions of learning a very high purpose will be served
by remembering the needs and the work of Howard
University, in the capital, where its students have
whatever inspiration there is in contact with the ad
ministration of the Government.
Older than Tuskegee is Howard . University, in
Washington, founded thirty-five years ago as a negro
university, which special character it has always main
tained. It has now enrolled a thousand students.
Its trustees and teachers are all negroes. -From its
professional schools have graduated half the negro
lawyers and a third of the negro doctors now suc
cessfully practicing their professions in this' country.
Seven hundred doctors, now not only practicing
medicine but instructing negroes in sanitary living
and the physical laws of life, are Howard graduates.
It has graduated also three hundred preachers,
three hundred lawyers, four hundred teachers and
four hundred men and women of full academic
training.
Worked out, it means the progress of the negro in
orderly life, industry, morality and all that goes into
the good order of the community. It puts him more
tipon his own responsibility, fosters in him that initia
tive which is at once the cause and the effect of suc
cess, and makes him an increasing contributor to the
commonwealth. For all these reasons it is the duty
ut the whites to themselves to actively encourage
every effort to educate the negro. Booker Washing
ton has made a grand start in promoting his indus
trial education. His institution at Tuskegee 5 is at
tracting the attention of the world. An eminent
California thinker, Major Weinstock, recently made
pilgrimage to it and addressed its students, declaring
it to be one of the most interesting movements now
going on in the world in behalf of a* race.
communities, one white, one black, each color will
have its own teachers and finally its own merchants
and m.nufacturers, bankers, business men and law
yers. We can see no other result to follow the
recessary social isolation of the race, nor can we see
a result that could be more useful and satisfactory to
both -aces. -
The American negroes now number in excess of
twelve millions, a majority of them being in the for
mer slave States. As there are no indications that
they can attain or that they generally seek what is
called social equality, it is evident that their physical
and spiritual wants, those needs that require the re
sponse of the doctor and the minister, must come to
be supplied by people of their own race. Not only
this, tut in the process of building up two separate
This is commendable and well, but it should not
make us lose sight of our obligation' to do something
for a race, originally in the midst of us against its
will, long held in bondage and liberated under con
ditions not favorable to its best advancement
Viewed from any standpoint it is evident that we are
to have the negro permanently with us. Indeed, the
race is not inclined to leave us. It has been so long
in association with us that no inducement seems ca
pable of luring it away. .
WE have about seven hundred school teach
ers in the Philippines engaged with varying
success in educating a people upon

V The'success of the Cabinet has been the more re
markable^because;.it .has beenf.;depehdent from the
'^a^iipotrradrcaP*and "socialist^votes^in the Cham|
h ber of Deputies". V' It enjoyed, however, the good for
tune of entering office at a time when France was
weary of the Dreyfus case, and when, accordingly,
that old cause of strife could be dismissed without
further ado. The Ministers were prompt to see the
opportunity and to profit by it. By, a general
amnesty act, which was as politic as it was illogical,
they set at rest all side issues arising from the famous
case and turned the attention of France to matters in
which there could be harmony and progress. The
universal exposition helped them . immensely, and
now they have the further good luck of entering upon
a general election at a time when the people are pros
perous and undisturbed by anything calculated to
make them vote against the Government through
sheer discontent and desire for change.
While prospects are thus promising for the Min
istry, the o$p*osition parties are. riot without their
prophets of victory. The Nationalists in particular
have entered upon a spirited campaign, and one of
their leaders, Jules Lemaitre, is reported to have
stated that he expects his. party, with such allies as
it can count on from other parties in the: Chamber,
to have a majority of eighty. The leading issue made
by the Nationalists is a revision, of the constitution
so as to provide, among other things, for the election
of the President of the republic by direct vote of the
people. That does not sound like a good programme
at a time when the people are seemingly well satis
fied with both the President and the constitution, and
the fact that it is put forward may be' taken as an
evidence that the opposition is without '& good issue
to fight upon. It; looks, therefore, as if; Waideck-
Rousseau were going to win easily.; ..
The Ministerialists express themselves sanguine of
success. Nearly every member of the Cabinet seems
well nigh certain of re-election, and it is reported"
that even-the-.leaders of the opposition concede that
only Baudin, Minister of Public Works; Leygues,
Minister of Public Instruction, and De Lanassan,
Minister' of; Marine, are in danger of. defeat. In fact,'
Waldeck-Rousseau appears to be playing in his usual
good luck. When he undertook to form a Cabinet
it .was predicted that his fall would follow within six
months, but he survived that period, and it was then
said he Vas tolerated only because the Deputies did
cot wish to have a parliamentary crisis during the
universal exposition. But that^ great undertaking
carrie arid went, leaving the Cabinet secure. Thus,
instead of being! turned. out. of office within six
.months, Waideck-Rousseau has maintained his^Min
istry for upward of three years, a Ministerial feat un
paralleled irf flies history of the republic.
Such a multitude of aspirants gave promise. of a
red-hot campaign, but up to this time there have been
no sensational developments.- That in itself augurs
well for the Ministry," for if- the people were-discon
tented and were likely to return a. majority adverse
to the present administration it is not probable they
would carry* on the campaign without some demon-,
stration of violence, or at least with something of
excitement and tumult.": : -
\T UDGING from the absence of any} reports' of
I excitement, the political campaign in 'France ap
. pears ,io begoing forward: with an unusual de
gree of moderation and calmness. " It has been an
nounced that on the first day for. the declarations of
candidates at' the various prefectures nb^less : than
179 candidates appeared for the forty-six seats; rep

THE I CAMPAIGN IN; PRANCE.
A; few- days ago Wu Ting Fang nearly fell out of
the;Senate gallery in his-excited listening to the de
bate on the Chinese exclusion act. He would have

means the worst that can be. Should he be re-elected
and his constitutional amendment be carried, the
State as a whole would be the prey of the corpora^,
tions and their horde of hungry tax-eaters.
. Gage's record in office has been one of marked sub
servience to the men who do politics for private , gain.
He has degraded the Normal Schools and the char
itable institutions of the State to the level of politi
cal spoils for the purpose of rewarding the henchmen
of Billy Herrin, Kelly, Crimmins, Lynch and Burke.
That record in itself has disgusted thousands of loyal
Republicans, as is attested by the emphatic protest
made by the Republican press of the State against
his renomination; but, bad as it is, it is by no
It will be seen that the commission is to take over
the whole authority now vested in counties, cities and
towns in such matters. It is virtually a proposition,
to the people of California to give up local self-gov
ernment over many of the most important matters ;
that affect a people and surrender all authority and;
power to a board of five men to be appointed by
Gage, one of those men to hold office for two years"
another for four j'earsj the third for six years, the :
fourth for eight years and the fifth for ten years.
The clause of the amendment defining. the powers
given to the commission is sweeping in its terms.
After declaring that the Commissioners are to have
supervision over telegraph, telephone, water, light,
power, transportation, sleeping car, express compa
nies and "other c6rporations," which phrase brings
banking and insurance companies under the control
of the commission, the amendment goes on to de
clare: "And from and after said appointment the
State commission shall in every respect, so far as re
lates to all and every the said rates and charges,
hereinbefore mentioned, and all and every the
matter of things, howsoever connected with perform
ing said service and furnishing and supplying such
commodities, be the successor under the constitu
tion and laws of the State of Boards of Supervisors
and City and County and. City and Town Councils
and other governing body or bodies of the several
counties, cities and counties, cities and towns of the
State."
It is to be borne in mind that the commission pro
posed by the amendment is not to be confined in its
powers to the supervision of railroads, express com
panies and other corporations doing business in all
parts of the State, but has authority also to regulate
rates for water, light, power and telephone compa
nies, which are strictly local in their nature and
operation. Let this amendment be adopted and all
home rule so far as the supervision of public utilities
is concerned will be'abolished. The Gage boardwill
dominate the people, and the corporations will domi
nate the board.
Such being the tactics of the bosses, it is the duty
of every newspaper in California to keep'the.amend
ment in the minds of the people and to point out its ;
evils. â¢ Every voter should be made aware of the full
significance of the scheme. There is' no other State
issue more important. Should this amendment be
carried Gage will name a commission which will give
every corporation controlling public utilities in the,
State virtual immunity from law. They will be able"
to. impose such rates as they choose, and make such
regulations as they choose, and the people will, have "
no recourse except that of an appeal to the commis^
sion appointed at the dictate of the corporations.
What chance will there be to obtain justice: under
such conditions?
A SSEMBLY constitutional amendment No. 28
/\ " is never publicly even so much as alluded, to
Â¦*_'Â¦*â¢ by the allied 'bosses who under the lead of
Billy Herrin are making the fight for the renomina
tion of Gage. To. expect them to discuss it would be
to expect" honesty of them.. They do not hunt ducks
with a brass band, these astute schemers, and even
their yellow organ in the Democratic camp, which
screams over every other subject, is discreetly silent
about this. The plans that are being laid for the
coming campaign include no 'open defense of the
amendment. The scheme is to let the issue drop
from public notice and then make a fight for. -it: on
election day, trusting that the people will be indif
ferent to it and will not take the trouble to vote
against it â¢

While the modus Vivendi agreed to by the American
members of the jWint, High' Commission is much bet

some respects unfortunate. ; While denying ; the
Canadian claim to a tidewater outlet from the Klon

at least a temporary port. That provision, instead of
putting an end to local friction in the disputed ter

- ~ ; r~ : ~His second contention was that the re
moval of a person with a fixed term of of
fice' before the expiration of that term
was Illegal, as he could not be removed
without notice, nor without cause. Such
a proceeding, he claimed, was penal in
character and involved a great constitu
tional question. He said the question at
issue was whether the f ramers of the
charter had the right to delegate the
power to try public officers, or whether It
came within the province of the courts.
Gavin McNab concluded the argument
for the old Board of Health. He claimed
that the Mayor, to whom he frequently
referred as "his Majesty the Mayor," had
constituted himself witness, judge, Jury
and executioner. Mayor Schmitz entered
the courtroom a few minutes after Mc-
Nab had completed his argument.
Attorney Ruef concluded the argument
by a review of the authorities quoted by
his opponents, holding that not one case
cited was analogous to the case at bar.
He claimed the right to hold office was
not inherent nor inalienable: that It was
also intangible, as the governing power
had the right to cut the tenure of office
short at any time.
After several interruptions by McEn
erney and McNab, Ruef read a statement
published before the new charter was
adopted, in which McBnerney declared
that among ten reasons why the new
charter should not be adopted was the
autocratic power - given the Mayor, in
which he was free to remove all appoint
tive officers.
The case was then submitted. Judge
Sloss announcing that he would render his
decision at as early a date as possible.
Attorney â¢ Garret McEneraey resumed
his argument on the two propositions sub
mitted yesterday, citing new authorities
for the contention of the old Board of
Health that the injunction should remain.
He submitted two of the propositions
which he argued until the noon hour.
One was the question of right of posses
sion, holding that as the^ old Beard of
Health had been .deposed illegally, the
members still comprised a de facto board
and were entitled to the- enjoyment of all
the privileges of office.
After another day of argument, Attor
ney Ruef submitted to Judge Sloss late
yesterday afternoon a petition' and mo
tion to dissolve the injunction now pend

When the coffin was lowered into the
tomb chiseled In the solid rock, all those
present sang "Old Hundred" and_ "Now
the Laborer's Task Is Over." The re
mainder of. the funeral service was chant
ed and the band played the dead march
from "SauL" The tomb was covered with
close of the ceremony those pres
ent slowly inspected the spot where

BULUWATO. Matabeleland, April 10.â
Amid an Immense throng of soldiers,
civilians and natives . the body of Cecil
Rhodes was to-day committed to its rock
tomb in the Matoppo Hills. The coffin
was shrouded In a Union Jack and the
wreath sent by Queen Alexandra was laid
upon It as it was lowered into the grave.
The funeral party started from Fuller's
Hotel early this niornlng. The procession^
was five miles long as it wound through
the hills and gorges. Every sort of con
veyance was made use of. Some were on
foot others were on horseback or on
bicycles, while still others were in wagons
and carriages. _ ,â_
- When the procession was a. mile from
the grave everybody dismounted and con
cluded the journey on foot. Twelve oxen
hauled the coffin to the almost inaccessi
ble summit of the kopje, where the chiefs,
Shembll. Faku and Umgula and i 2000 1 na
tives had Wmbled to witness the Chris
tian interment rites which they afterward
supplemented in their own fashion by the
sacrifice of fifteen oxen to the shade of
"white persons congregated
around the wind-swept hill.. The grave
was encircled by six Riders The in
terment was extremely Impressive. The
"dead march" echoed through the hills
and the natives stood like statues. Tears
were in the eyes of many of the on
lookers. The Bishop of Mashonaland who
conducted the interment service, said:
I understand the court attached criminal re-'
sponslbility to mere participation, in connection
with- subsequent acts of violence in a meeting
at which nothing was 'done further than to re-
Bolve to make a demand for higher wages. The
records only show, in explanation of the sen
tence of three years, four months and eight
days, that Iglesias is, or that he was, the
founder of- a society Judged illegal.

ment of personal liberty.. â¢ The right to assem
ble peacefully to better the social condition . is
surely fundamental. If any Spanish law in
Porto Rico, impairs this right it has become
a nullity with the change' of sovereignty, In
my judgment.
Attorney General Harlan yesterday, be
fore the trial, sent a long letter to 8 the
public tprosecutor, expressing his views.
He said:
: . SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, : April 10.â The
Supreme Court of Porto Rico yesterday
heard the^'appeal .of " Santiago Iglesias,
president of the Federation of Workmen
of Porto Rico, who was sentenced Decem
ber 12 last to three years, four months and
eight days' imprisonment on the charge
of conspiring to raise the price of labor
in Porto -Rico. Decision was reserved un
til Saturday. -He will undoubtedly be ac
quitted. Counsel for Iglesias dwelt . upon
the constitutional | right- of the people -to
assemble peaceably. , The public prose
cutor, ; to the surprise ., of the throng
in the courtroom, sustained and strength
ened the argument of the defense. He
said the appeal was well taken,. put in no
evidence -for the prosecution and prac
tically asked the - court to dismiss the
case. â¢ Â¦
The article which led to the references
appeared in. an anarchistic sheet, pub
lished in Geneva. Slgnor Silvestrelli de
manded that the authorities prosecute the
paper, but the Swiss Government replied
it could not act without a complaint being
formally , lodged by the Italian Govern
ment. Italy declined to adopt, this course
and the correspondence following finally,
led to the rupture of diplomatic relations.
BERNE, Switzerland,' April. 10.âDiplo
matic relations' between Switzerland and
Italy have been ruptured. This action
arises from the refusal of Switzerland to
give satisfaction regarding an article pub
blished in Geneva, insulting; the memory
of the murdered King Humbert.
The Bundesrath has sent the following
communication to Parliament: \ ;
Regrettable misunderstandings â¢ have oc
curred between us and Slfenor SHvestrelli, the

LOS ANGELES, April ID. â Having
launched a suit for 320,000 damages against
Dr. J. J. Willingham of this city for
breach of promise. Miss Emma S. Rich
ards to-dayÂ« started another action against
Mrs. Mary Tighe, sa'.d to be nearly 80
years old, for $20,030 damages for alleged
alienation of the doctor's affections.
â¢ Miss Richards, who is acting as her
own lawyer, says in her complaint that
the $20,005 is due her because, through
the machinations of the defendant, she
was deprived of the right and opportunity
to marry Dr. Willingham. She tells how
ready and willing she was to marry the
doctor in September, 1S00, and then goes
en to say:
"Mary Tighe well knew cf the engage
ment to marry existing between the
plaintiff and said Willingham. and said
defendant wrongfully intending- to injure
the plaintiff and deprive her of the love,
affection -and society of the eaid Willing
ham, maliciously induced said Willing
ham to enter into relations with her. the
defendant, of such a nature and charac
ter as to entire the said Willingham away
from plaintiff, and caused him to refuse
to raarry 'Â¦ plaintiff."
Continuing, Miss Richards says Mrs.
Tighe slandered her by telling tbe doc
tor she wag not a fit perron for him to
marry; that she was a dangerous woman,
end that all she wanted was to "get the
doctor into a box and make trouble" for

Investigation Is said to show that the
Indian had frectuently threatened to kill
the woman. On the evening of March 30.
Joe Pete,\ the woman and her brother
drove to El Monte, where they camped.
On Monday, night the Indian, with the
woman, left' the camp, ostensibly for the
brickyard. The body of the woman was
found several hundred yards west of. the
point where the Indian said she fell off
their wagon Â¦ and on the fence near by
was a matting of. blood and one of her
arms lay a few feet away. The police are
confident that the Indian murdered the
woman and then laid her body on the
track bo that the train would mutilate
it and murder would not be suspected.
On the morning . of April 1 Policeman
Strode was hunting and near the Four
Mile House, on. the Shcrb branch of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, he found the
mangled remain* * of a Mexican woman.
Four days later Joe Pete, an Indlan^went
to the detective office and stated that the
woman's name was Juana Palaya and
that she waa his wife. He said that he
was on his way to Rhodes' brickyard, in
Garibaldi Canyon, where he had been
promised, employment, when the accident
happened. He told hla story in such a
manner that the police became suspicious
and a detective waa detailed on the case.
LOS ANGELES. April 10.â Detectives
have unearthed what they are satisfied
is a dastardly murder. Joe Pete, an In
dian, has been in the tanks of the City
Jail since Tuesday night and to-day he
was charged with having committed the
crime.

thereby elevating the domestic. I was very
familiar' with Â¦ the life there and knew 'the
lanenaee so well that I was doing good work
in tl>e missions when I was seized.
One nisht when the baby, a dear little
black-eyed tiling. ' was only three days old, I
had to carry her strapped "to my back through
an eight hours'- march over wild .mountain
roads. Time and again they threatened us
with bodily harm. When negotiations failed
they would come -to. us- and say: .."If that
money don't' come toon here is a bullet' for
you," and they would, point significantly to
their suns. I can't even say how many were
in the band. They were In ' Turkish dres?.
Some iÂ»i>oke Greek and some Albanian. I don't
know their njmes. They were "Tom. Dick and
Harry" to me. When I was released I hardly
knew it. I nad not had a single word from
the outside world throughout six months. They
said something about our pictures in the pa
pers, but that Is all I ever knew. One night
we started oil as usual, but soon, came to a
desolate place, where we stopped. for about an
hour. It was nothing unusual and I did hot
know anything: important was to happen. Sud
denly, however, two of them came to us and
ordered us to come with them. When they
led r.s to a' little town -and left us I hard.ly
realized that I was free. â¢ ..Â¦Â¦...Â¦
The birth of Mme. Tpllka's baby was our
salvation. The brigands are very supersti
tious, and believed that a curse would be on
them if they harmed the young mother or her
child. So when the baby came We were treatei
better.
The brigands still have some of that Old
World chivalry, and so in some ways they
treated us kindly. After we were in the wild
districts we marched- only at night. Not once
did I know where we were. When I wrote
what I did, seeking ransom. It was because
they forced me to at the point of "a rifle. They
fed us well, however, and often we ate before
tney did. When I expressed my â¢ surprise at
this they said it was their business 'to keep us
In good health, as all they wanted was money.
"When. I caught cold they seemed Â¦ greatly wor-,
rled and once, when I sprained my knee by
falling- into a hole, they were .thoroughly dis
gusted with me. I guess we traveled at night
because'.we were Â¦ beine pursued, -but I never
saw any one .after us.- There was no actual
cruelty thown us. but they treated us most
contemptuously. When negotiations for our re
lease failed their actions toward us were very
severe. â¢ : : .
ilzne. Tsilka was taken. because they had to
have a married lady to chaperon me. There
was another woman with us, a Bulgarian Bible
worker, Mrs. Woosheva, - but she was sick and
they could not take her.
They were fully armed, while Tsilka was the
only one In our party who had a revolver. He
prepared to use it. but the rest of us, seeing
that resistance was useless, begged him not
to. The brigands all had rifles. Then the brig
ands left a guard around the rest of the party
and hurried lime. Tsilka and myself off. It
was all done eo quickly that - 1 hardly knew
what happened.
The day we. were taken was market day. the
safest of all days to. travel. .There were ten
in our party and three drivers. It was late in
the afternoon and we were going along a lonely
road when suddenly the brigands Jumped out
of the bushes at the roadside and surrounded
us, crying "Dour, dour," which means stop. '
When seen on the steamer Miss Stone
showed plainly traces of her awful strain.
In talking of her capture she said:
NEW YORK, April 10.â Worn out with
the strain of an ocean voyage and not yet
fully, recovered from the nervous strain
ensuing from six months' captivity, Miss
Ellen Stone, the American missionary,
who was held for ransom by Bulgarian
brigands, arrived to-day on the Deutsch
land. She will Â¦ immediately proceed to
her home in Chelsea, Mass., to eee her
aged mother.' Major Pond, who will man
age her lecturing tour, announced that
the money she made in that, way would
be applied immediately .to repaying the
amount of her ransom, $72,000.

Before his election as County Auditor
Raby was treasurer of the town of Pull
man. He has a wife and one child, a
boy of two years. Mrs. Raby is quite ill.
Raby has many friends both here and at
Pullman. When asked for a statement he
declined to make one, but said he might
do so later. He simply stated that his
bond would amply protect the county
from any shortage which might be discov
ered in his accounts. He is under a bond
for J15.000.
The Commissioners met Monday. Mem
bers of the board declare Raby was un
able to pay to the county all of the fees
collected during the month of March. An
investigation followed, and when ofllcers
of the Second National Bank gave the
board a letter from the American Bridge
Company, asking why their claim had not
been allowed Auditor Raby was called be
icre the board and acknowledged having
cashed the warrant November 29, 1901.
The County Auditor- is charged with
having appropriated to his own use $1553
drawn by him on a warrant issued to- the
American Bridge Company of Chicago.
When called before the Board of Commis
sioners Raby acknowledged that he had
taken the money and said his bondsmen
axe good for the amount. The affair has
caused the greatest sensation Colfax has
experienced for a long time.

LARGE AUDIENCE AGAIN
GREETS CHORAL SOCIETY
The object of the entertainment was to
raise money for the erection of a new
parochial residence for the clergy â¢ of St.
Patrick's Church, and as on both nights
the hall was packed to the very door a
satisfactory sum was realized. Father
Cummins, pastor of the church, is very
thankful for the manner in which the
people assisted in making- the affair a
complete success 1 .
Native Sons' Hall was again crowded
to the doors last night at the second pre
sentation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic
operetta. "Patience," by St Patrick's
Choral Society. All the" stars who dis
tinguished themselves on the first per
formance were at their best last night
and sustained their roles In the most com
mendable manner. Miss Etta "Welsh In
the role of Patience, Miss Sullivan as
Lady June. Miss Byrnes as Angela, Miss
Hausmann as Ella and Miss Anthony as
Saphir. all Â¦vron applause by the clever
manner in which they interpreted their
parts. In fact there was not a single
member of the cast who did not cover
himself with glory.

If You Want One of These
Regular $300 Pianos for
$186 af Pommer Eiiers
Music Company, You Will
Have to Act Quickly. Easy
Monthly Payments for Those
Not Prepared to Pay Ail
Cash. ___
The first piano yesterday morning was
eold before 8 o'cloclc; the store was
crowded with eager Inquirers and pur-
chasers all day long, and the day's record
of sales will probably be larger than any
heretofore. "It would hardly seem pos-
sible that such beautiful pianos can be
sold at retail for such little money," said
a musical young lady yesterday, who se-
cured cne of these brand-new $300 upright
pianos for $1S6, to be shipped to a friend
in the northern part of the State. We ad-
mitted that we don't expect to make
much money on this occasion â but we.
realize that this opportunity presents
splendid advertising possibilities for Pom-
mer Kilers Music Co., in that it most
forcefully demonstrates our ability to un-
dersell any existing wholesale or retail
piano-feelling firm in this country, and
will make lor us an army of friends who
will, in turn, help us sell more of our fine
pianos to othersâ thus making a sort of
endless chain that gains force and, pres-
tige each day.
There is not a firm in San Francisco
that has been able to sell these brand-
new Cabinet Grand upright pianos for
less than $300 heretofore, and in some In-
stances they have been sold for as much
as $325 and even $330. But you find them
here now for $18&â and as a further In-
ducement for you to take them quickly
we will let you have one of them on pay-
ment of $10 down and $6 a month
Think of it! brand-new, fully warrant-
ed, fancy mahogany, or mottled walnut
or figured oak, high-grade upright pianos
for $186! One and the same price to all
alike, rio more is asked, no less accepted
âthree per cent off to cash buyers .'or
payments at $10 down and $5 a month
You cannot afford to be without a good
piano now.
Rest assured that these pianos are in
every way as good and as durable as the
instruments which 'dealers are ordinarily
compelled to ask $300 for. This is not an
overstatement â but fact â that you can
easily verify if you will take but a few
moments to investigate at our store
We are standing back of every represen-
tation made regarding these and all of our
pianos. "Money back If not as repre-
sented" applifes to every transaction with
Pcmicer Eiiers Music Company, whether
It be the cheapest or. the most unpreten-
tious instrument or. whether it pertain*
to a fancy Cabinet Grand . Hazelton, or
KImball, .or . Crown, or -other highest
grade and most costly upright pianos. Rer

William Little and Robert McCaskie
. Arrested on Charge of
Battery.
Wiillam Little and Robert McCaskie ap
peared^before Judge Fritz yesterday on a
charge of battery, and, by consent, the
case was continued until Saturday, as
one of the . principal witnesses for the
prosecution could not be present.
Little and McCaskie are supposed to
be two of the men who have been as
saulting drivers of milk wagons because
they had resigned from Â¦ the union or re
fused to join It. Monday morning about
2 o'clock Little and McCaskie attacked
J. 8. Perry, driver of a wagon for James
Miley of the Main Dairy, on Tenth and
Howard streets* while he, was delivering
milk to a customer at Sixth and Natoma
streets. They emptied all his milk cans
and beat him on the head and -arms with
the empty cans, threatening to kill him
unless he rejoined the union.
Perry swore out warrants for their ar
rest,' and Wednesday night Detective
Graham and Policeman Evatt, accom
panied by Perry, arrested them on Turk
street, ' near - Mason, .where they were
hiding in a building in course of con
struction,-evidently, waiting for some milk
wagon driver. - Little told the officers that
he was employed collecting dues for the
union and to get new members. MUey
Is determined to prosecute them, so as
to 'put a stop to the attacks that have
become so frequent, another of his driv
ers having been threatened.

NEW YORK. April 10.â There was a very
wild market for, Louisville and Nashville to
day and the ominous jumps made by the price
In its convulsive advance to 120 "this morning
aroused unpleasant Memories of May 9 last
year when Northern Pacific was cornered; pre
cipitating: the Beverett panic in the history of
the Stock Exchange. Many of the active oper
ators In LouIs\-JJle and Nashville on the rise
have fostered the supposition that a distressed
short interest was aimed at by the campaign.
T.he disposition to buy stocks was suddenly
cooled and a preference for the selling side de
veloped. The disposition to sell was increased
Â£' aJ i other flurry in the money market during
the afternoon and the selling movement spread
throughout the list carrying prices of the ac
tive stocks very generally between 1 aid 2
points under . last night. Stocks which had
been conspicuous for strength, notably South
ern Railway and Missouri Pacific, did not
escape damage to some extent- In some cases
the losses considerably exceeded these limits.
Louisville and Nashville alone of -the prominent
stocks continued to show feverish strength,
rebounding from each successive reaction.
There was some covering by professional shorts
before the close, but the felling was actively
renewed and the closing was Irregular and not
far from the lowest. The action of Louisville
and Nashville seemed to Indicate that a short
interest In the stock was feeling considerable
distress to maintain Its position. The Wall
street supjjositlon is plausible that the dispo
sition of the $5,000,000 new stock authorized
involved a short' position In the market tech
nically, necessitating the borrowinK of the
stock sold until the Stock Exchange authori
ties admit the new stock to the list. Reports
of buying for control by competing companies
or of Intended consolidations have all met with
official denials. As a tactical speculative
measure for inciting speculation elsewhere in
the market the wild movement in Louisville
and Nashville is a failure. During the first
hour to-day over one-quarter of the total cap
ital stock of the company changed hands and
dealings for the day amounted to over half
the capitalization. Within three days the num
ber of shares sold has been many thousand in
excess of t^e total capitalization of the com
pany. The i-.ghly speculative movement of
the market is therefore clear. The dealings in
Southern Railway continued very large to-day
In accordance with the hypothesis of a contest
for control between the two companies, Â¦ but It
made no great progress upward and shared
In the late reaction. The rise I I Missouri
Pacific was ascribed to pool. opera. s based
on the evident working" out of exttÂ«. ns for
the Gould system. The sensitive conation of
the money market was emphasized by the day's
announcements of a huge combination in the
hardware trade, the undertaking by American
capital to finance the London traction improve
ment and thÂ« purchase by New York -capital
ists of the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Rail
read, all promising requirements for credits.
Foreign exchange declined further. Indicating
further borrowing of foreign . capital and ob
viating tbe chance of further immediate gold
exports. Probably some of the late selling was
due to a desire to close up accounts in ex
pectation of the Government crop report after
the cloflr.E.
The bond market yielded to realizing In sym
pathy with stocks and became Irregular after
notable strength in the recently active specu
lative Issues. Total sales, par value, $4,975,000.
United States 6s advanced Vi on the last

"In the money market there ts Mule change.
There is no scarcity of funds for rood bor-
Towers. but rates are steady and likely to re
main eo until the reserves begin to grow.
Whether Europe will flraw freely upon us for
rcld or not remains to be Been. British and
Jiusrlan loan* are in protpect, and these wonld
Â¦no doubt cause Borne disturbance in the Inter
national money markets. In this connection
Jt ic well to remember that our Imports ar*
1 eteaclly rising and exports declining, render
f inr impossible the remarkable trade balances
Â¦which were such a stimulating feature in 1901
and 11)00."
"The moet questionable point in the stock
market Is among the industrials. During the
last few months we have had a succession of
unfavorable reports from these concerns, show-
Ing decreased earnings, mismanagement and a
general failure of the roseate promises In early
j.roppectuse*. l.'nder such condition* the loads
of o-jTcrcapitalttsttoH "begin" to have their effect
and not a few concerns, which It is unneces
sary to . mention, have already undergone
niarked declines in their quotations. The fu
ture of this branch of the market is not prom
ising-. The flay of reckoning, liquidation and
reorpantzation must come. At present it is de
layed by the larpe demand of all kinds of
manufactured products; in short, by the gen
eral activity of business. As boob, however.
Â«s this begins to eubside, prices decline and
Jrcreased expenses cut Into earnings then we
may look for results which every one hopes
may be postponed as long as possible. ThÂ»
Â¦dang-er is not near, but it is real nnfl stibuld
JJOt be lost ei*ht of.
"The financial situation is sound and gren
erally satisfactory. Desirable Investments are
in very pood demand and exceedingly scarce,
even at present high level. Hence first-class
railroad securities are held with tenacious
firir.ness, which seems to grow with the con
tinued and wholly unexpectedly favorable rail
road earnings. The most sanguine, expecta
tions in this .respect have been far surpassed
and conservatives are often afraid to express
their convictions. The real reason of railroad
prosperity, hewever, lies not bo much In the
Increase in the volume of trarfic as In the bet
ter rates new obtained. In not a few Instances
the volurce of traffic is not equal to last year.
but high and well-maintained rates explain
ourrt-nt railroad profits. The great value of
the oemmunity-of-intercst idea and Its control
Wt the rate situation is now being illustrated.
It has more to do with the present high values
â¢of railroad shares than any other single Influ
ence, and so it is easy to understand the sen-
EiUvraes-a cf the market to any legislative at
tacks thÂ£t would alter these conditions. There
U no doubt rr.nch concern In railroad circles
ever the ajvprersive and antagonistic attitude
Â«f the edmir.istratjon toward railroad Interest*
Â«n4 thÂ« outcome cl recently begun proceedings
â¢will be wau-hÂ«-d with intense Interest. The
j>ubllc xvant *iÂ£bilit> of rates above all else;
thty also want rtat-onable rates, and if legis
lation is conlined to these two limitations no
dang-w Is anticipated. But the public also
â¢wantE competition in rate*, something entirely
incompatible with stability and equality of
rates. Between these conflicting demands the
Legislature must etand and decide which is beet
Joi til concerned, not forgetting that the many
thousands of stockholders and those dependent
Â¦upon them have nsrhts as well as excitable,
easy-talking shippers who disregard every In
terest but their own.

Beivlces to Cecil Rhodes. American stocks be

per ' cent money rate. These rallied sharply,
cloring near the torx. Louisville and Nash-"
vllle absorbed attention. New York buying
henvlly. London Is puzzled but does not rec
ognize Irresponsible manipulation. Berlin

theory that they became lost in the Ingle

been attempting to unravel what threat

the Court.
Mrs. Eva Miller and Mrs. Adaline Schaefer, the Last; Named Newly
in the Forests arid Hills That Cover t the Ingleside District
Wed and But 18; May Have Perished or Met With Foul Play
Story of the Litigation of the
Bell Estate Told by
Attorney.
Attorney T. Z. Blakeman occupied the
Â¦witness stand throughout the entire day
in the hearing of the creditors* contest of
the account of the special administratrix
of the Bell estate, which was resumed in
Judge Coffey's court yesterday. Blake
man testified at length concerning the
legal services performed by him. in be
half of the estate and tor which he was
allowed $3000. , .
Blakeman said the sum was not paid to
him until his claim had been scrutinized
by Judge Coffey. The court allowed the
fee with the mutual understanding that it
was subject to contest by the creditors the
eame as any other Item of expenditure
might be. Tfte point made was a valuable
one for the administratrix and for Blake
man JUmself, inasmuch as it showed that
the fee was not considered excessive by
the court and that Blakeman. was entitled
to charge that sum.
In the course of his examination by At
torney Galvin, Blakeman told of the vast
litigation in which the estate was in
volved and which occupied his attention
for two years. He related the circum
stances of the removal of George Staacke
as executor on the ground of fraud.
Staacke sought to compromise a claim
against the Kobinson estate for $2500. but
Blakeinan forced the estate into liquida
tion and secured over $40,000 for the credi
tors of the Bell estate. ;
The various items of expenditures which
were the subject of contest by the creditors
were explained in detail by Blakeman. The
payment of $1000 to Baldwin, a real estate
man. which was included in the contested
items, was explained by Blakeman as
having been paid out of the Robinson
estate money for securing a purchaser of
the property at the amount bid for it by
one Peters, who had bid in the property
with Blakeman's consent in order to save
It from being knocked down at the value
of the mortgage.
In speaking of the litigation with Miss
f Louisa J. Thompson for the annulment
of a deed to the Laguna ranch on the
prounds of collusion between Staacke and
Miss Thompson. Blakeman said that
Attorneys Drown, Leicester & Drown,
counsel for the Bell creditor?, are also
counsel for . Miss Thompson. The ranch
is claimed to be worth $134,000, but it was
knocked down to Miss Thompson with
Staacke's assistance for SSS.OOO, the
amount of the mortgage and accrued in
terest.
The cross-examination of Blakeman
was begun, but little of interest was ad
duced before adjournment of court. The
matter will go on again next Monday
morning.
COURTNEY INDICTED FOR \
MURDER IN NEW YORK
He Will Be First Tried Here for the
Killing of Policeman Robin
son.
Captain Seymour received a dispatch
yesterday from Captain Titus of New
Tork stating that James Courtney, alias
"Leadville Jimmie." had been indicted
there for murder in the first degree and
that a bench warrant would be mailed at
once. The dispatch ..concluded, "Hold
him for us. Wire if we can have him."
A reply was sent that Courtney would
have to stand his trial here first for the
murder of Policeman Eugene Robinson
last January. The arrival of Frank
Kauffman, alias "St. Louis Frank," in a
few days will be followed by the prose
cution of the five men for Robinson's
