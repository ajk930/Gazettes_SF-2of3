l^ater in the day Miss Hamassen had
another similar attack, but by this time
her own physician was present and she
was removed to her home.
"It was a case of suspended animation,"
said Mrs. Cooke. "I have seen It often in
my husband's case and that was the only
treatment for it. It Is caused by some
heart trouble, I suppose."
Mrs. Cooke, another student, quietly
knelt down and breathed into Miss
Hamasscn's mouth. This somewhat outre
performance resuscitated the Invalid.
DENVER. April 25.â An instance of pe
culiar heart trouble occurred at University
Park to-day. Miss Eva Hamassen, a stu
dent at the university, was taken sudden
ly ill in one of the classrooms and frighr
cned the other students by presenting
every sign of death. A young physician,
a resident of the park, was sent for and
on his arrival . he tried to revive Miss
Hamassen with brandy, but without suc
cess. It was at this point that a woman's
wit and a woman's readiness to act be
came efficacious In the saving of a life.

Another factor in forcing the company
to the change Is the movement -on the
part of several roads toward the â¢ south
western coast, and that of the people of
San Diego, In making the survey for their
road, the San Diego and Eastern. Nat
urally if any other road passes south of
the sandhills It will have the first choice
of the ground, and the Southern Pacific
does not propose to let another road have
that desirable first choice.
The Southern Pacific Company took the
northern route, but it has seen those
sandhills drifting steadily farther to the
north until it has become a question of
but a very few years when it will be
forced to abandon the pass. It is prac
tically impossible to keep the right of way
clear of the drifting sand. The company
has appropriated $500,000 to lay heavy rails
( across the desert, and, realizing the neces
sity for changing its route soon, this is
found to be an opportune time for doing
so. .
SURVEY IS COMMENCED.
The Southern Pacific has already set a
force of men at work on the survey for
the new line, and, as the country is per
fectly -level. It wnrtJBte tout~**-reV days"
to make the run from route
will pass the Salton Basin on the west,
instead of the north, a point near
â¢Walters, where the new; road will again
connect with the old roadbed and .con
tinue into Los Angeles through Indio. .
It cannot be definitely announced that
the Southern Pacific has made a deal
with the San Diego and Eastern road.
That may not be the case, but the In
formation is to the effect that when
President Harriman was In Southern Cali
fornia a few days ago it was definitely
decided that the company would make the
change in its roadbed at once and build to
this city, which will require but 125 miles
of additional trackage.
The reasons for making the change are
numerous. The most Important is the fact
that on the western side of the Colorado
River there is a chain of sandhills about
fifty miles long, extending from a point
in Mexico to the northwest, where they
approach close to the foothills of the
Chuckawalla Mountains. Any road'com-
Ing west from Yuma is forced to choose
between the^ narrow pass north of the
sandhills and one entering Mexican terri
tory, south of the hills.
SANDHILLS ABE DILUTING. '
SAN DIEGO, April 26.â Sensational in
formation regarding railroad affairs leak
ed out from authentic sources to-day. It
has been learned that the Southern Pa
cific Company is to abandon about 100 miles
of Its main line west of Yuma, follow
ing the south Instead of the north line of
the Colorado Desert, forking at Imperial,
with a second line to San Dieero over the
survey of the San Diego and Eastern
road, or in the neighborhood of that sur
vey. This implies the absorption of the
Imperial and Gulf Railroad, now being
graded.
Aside from the importance of this move
to the towns of Southern California it
has an indirect effect on transcontinental
business, as the road will pass for a short
distance through Mexican territory, thus
relieving It from control by the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The Southern
Pacific Railroad will be 'placed in the
same position as the Canadian Pacific
Railroad, which for years has been a dis
turbing element in transcontinental traf
fic.

STRIKE AFFECTS BTrELDIirG.
Causes Fewer Applications for Pex
mits.to Be Filed.
As one result of the strike Commission
er Manson of, the Board of Public Works
points to the fact that there are fewer
building permits being granted than for
merly. Only three were issued yesterday
and on Wednesday but eight, while ..tbo
average number has been fifteen or six
teen a day for some time. The high prlcÂ»
for material Is one of the contributing
causes of the partial cessation of ; building
operations, according to Manson, who
says that It is impossible to get millstuff
and planed lumber, and contractors are
compelled to wait thirteen months for
structural steel work.
"Our strike committee is . meeting to
night, and plans are constantly beins
formed to take them by surprise, t#, hit
them where they are not expecting it.
just as we hit Mr. Vining Saturday night
when he was hugging the belief that
there could be no strike.

Some few hours after this statement
had been issued came the news that the

- At 7:20 o'clock last evening Hoiiand said
that no word had come through, and he
feared nothing would be known until

"The executive committee -is engaged in

made by the committee, of Its employes.
The necessity of communicating with
New York involves a slight delay."
There were certain clauses in the de
mands submitted by the men that they
know would not be altogether acceptable
to the Eastern owners, but they felt sure
the men ; would make reasonable conces
sions. V >Â¦*.Â»'/. ,
Early In the afternoon - the following
statement was made by- President Hol
land, who was .desirous that .".the public
should be informed of the status of al
fairs: Â¦ ..
CLAUSES NOT ACCEPTABLE.
Each one of the company's representa
iives plainly showed the anxiety that the
urgent circumstances of the moment
caused them. That. they had looked for
ward to a satisfactory termination of the
trouble yesterday there is no doubt.
So desirous was President Holland to
hasten the adjustment of the differences
that he remained many hours during
Thursday night at'hls office sending and
receiving telegrams from the East. He
was at his office early yesterday morning
and kept the wires busy, but in the after
noon, when the final answers were looked
for, all telegraphic communication was
interrupted and matters were necessarily
brought to a standstill. '-^i". .
Early in the day the local representa
tives of the company had* come to a de
cision as to what ought to be done to
bring the matter to a conclusion, satis
factory to the public, the striking carmen
and the company. In view, however, ot
the great amount of money invested by
the Eastern owners of the railroads,
it was felt necessary by the officials to
communicate to ttiem the conclusions ar.
rived at by the executive body. This wasÂ»
done, and the committee representing thÂ«>
company waited with no little anxiety
for a reply to their urgent telegraphic
message. The impatience of the com
munity, the seriousness of the condition
and strain suffered by the. city were fully
telegraphed, as was, also, the advice ot
those upon whom the local responsibili
ties had, to a large extent, been placed.
HOPED FOB. SETTLEMENT.
It was hoped that "ell communications
with the East might have been closed
in the afternoon or early in the evening,
so that a settlement might have been ef
fected between the executive committee
and the men. V .T^.
The executive committee, consisting of
President Arthur Holland, Joseph S. To

The employes went to work with a will
and throughout the day they expressed
their satisfaction at the result of their
conference with the officials of the line.
They conversed good-naturedly with the
patrons of the road, but not a bitter word
was expressed against anyone in author
ity. The men say they went out for. the
sake of. the union and that the recogni

compensated them for the time lost up

date from yesterday. That is to say that

The Times admits that the question of
subsidized liners is important and re
quires further elucidation. The paper
hints that the enormous business expan
sion of an activity in the United States is
not taking an altogether healthy and 6a.fe
form and that the big combine in business
may be easily overdone.
The Times further understands, that
pressure will be brought- upon the Gov
ernment to represent to Lord Pauncefote
the British Embassador at Washington'
the urgency of obtaining a report; as to
the extent and organization of trusts in
the United States and their' effect upon
commercial- transactions.
In an editorial deprecating the alarmist
views on the subject and tending: to de
fend the combine, the Times refers to the
wild suggestions of the necessity of Gov
ernment Interference and declines to see
that it will seriously diminish Great Brit
ain's command of the 6ea.

The Economist says it thinks the amal

The Times announces that the shipping
combine corporation is now In process of
organization, the issue stock having been
underwritten here and in America, and
that the promoters are ready to extend
the capital to Â£40,000,000. The paper says
also that the Cunard line will probably

lines to follow.

GREAT RAILWAY
THK residents along the Geary
street line were in a good
humor yesterday, the occasion
being the reopening of the'
railway after an interruption
of five days. The resounding
gongs and grinding noise of
iron wheels sounded as the softest music
to the ears of the footsore people near
the park, who had for five days been do
ing pedestrian stunts against their wil!.
The scene about the carhoutie of the
company was an animated one at 5 a. m.,
when the employes to the number of
nearly seventy reported for duty. Each
man wore his badge and all were in the
best spirits at the prospect of getting
back to their runs. The first car,to leave
the house was in charge of Conductor
M. Harrington and Motorman W. C.
Fisher.
The resumption of traffic was not only
profitable to the company, but it relieved
the press of travel on the California
street line. Immense crowds rode down
town before 9 o'clock, the greater part of
these â¢ being residents of the district far
to the south of Geary street and the west
end. of Point Lobos avenue. Â»

In order to accommodate the great

WASHINGTON, April 25.â The Senate
Committee on Cuba to-day decided to in
stitute an investigation into the charge
that the greater part of the present crop
of Cuban sugar is held by the sugar trust
of this country, as directed by the resolu
tion introduced in the Senate by Teller on
the lath in=t.
The action of the committee was' favor
able only to the rlrst half of the resolu
tion, which provides for an inquiry affect
ing the present holdings of Cuban sugar.
It was ueciaed to strike out that portion
of (he resolution requiring an investiga
tion of the norn/al cost of making sugar
in Cuba and also into the general ques
tion of reciprocity with Cuba. The com
mittee held that those cuestiojjs are al
ways before the committee ana to adopt
that "portion of the resolution would be
equivalent to instructing the committee
to perform its ordinary duties.
A provision was added empowering the
committee. to send tor persons and papers,
and a sub-committee, consisting ot sena
tors Platt of Connecticut, Burnham and
Teller, was appointed to hear the testi
mony. Senator Platt announced that it
was his purpose to extend all facilities to
those making the charges, that the Cuban
planters would not get the benetit of the
proposed reduction in duties, to prove
these charges, adding that he would do
all in his power to render the inquiry ex
haustive. The resolution was adopted and
the preamble upon which it is based fol
lows:
Whereas. It has been currently reported that
nearly the entire crop of Cuban sugar has
been purchased and Is now held by what is
generally known as the "aujar trust," whicn
is the principal consumer of raw sugar In the
United States, and that any concessions given
to the raisers of cane sugar in the island of
Cuba or any measures intended for their relief
by admitting their sugar at reduced rates of
duty into the United States will only benefit
the said sugar trust, and that the Cubans -will
receive no real benefit from such concessions;
and
Whereas. It is alleged that a large number
of citizens of the United States have acquired
large holdings of cane-producing lands in Cuba,
and arc now especially urging the reduction of
duty on sugar under the claim that such re
duction will benefit the people of Cuba; there
fore be it /
Resolved, That the Committee 'on Relations
with Cuba be. and -hereby is, directed to make
an investigation as to . the truth of such
charges and report to the Senate.

The unanimous conclusion of the finance
*r,d executive committees is that, considering
the vast aggregate value of the physical prop
erties, the proposed $250,000,000 increase of
bonds from 5300.000.000 to $550,000,000 is wise
End conservative, the preferred stock issue
being simultaneously decreased 40 per cent of
$700,000,000. The consequent $14,000,000 re
duction of dividend payments as compared
with the $12,500,000 increase of interest would
result in a nÂ»t annual saving of $1,500,000, ex
ceeding *y $490,000 the annual sinking fund
contribution of $1,010,000 to be required by
the proposed mortgage, and which, inverted
at 4 jter cent, would be sufficient tn sixty
years to pay off all of the $250,000,000 bond*.

As the preferred stock carried 7 per cent
dividends, while the bonds would bear but 5
per cent interest, the $50,000,000 desired could
:n this way be added to the corporate re
f-ourccs, and thÂ« aggregate of the annual
charges for interest and dividends, instead of
Jielng increased $3,500,000. would be decreased

The problem confronting the finance com
mittee has been to make provision for this

which cannot be scld at tess than par and
v.-hich, if sold at par, would entitle to divi

italizing both the $15,000,000 expended during

corporation's organization and the $10,000,000

Thesr three purposes in the aggregate call for

Within the next few months will fall due

liminary report to the stockholders these pay

tee's recommendation and believes" that, ae de
sired by the executive committee, $25,000,000

However, owing largely to advance commit
ments, it was impossible to stop all construc

vnder way, cash payments have been made
during the year to the amount of $15,000,000.

instances had actually begun the construction
of additions to their plants, -which. in
some instances, would have duplicated the

aggregate of these contemplated expenditures

the preliminary report, much that at the time
of the crcranization it was hoped might be
accomplished in the way of avoiding- wasteful
expenditures for the unnecessary enlargement
of plants has been accomplished by co-opera
tion among: the several companies, enabling

Accompanying this circular was a re
port of the finance committee which \set
forth in detail various reasons why the
refunding plan should be approved, to

ing how the plan is to be carried out.
The stockholders' report, signed by Presi
dent Schwab and Chairman Garj'p says in
part: /
NEW TORK. April 23.â Stockholders of
tnc United States Steel Corporation today
received a circular letter of the cor
poration, setting forth the exact terms
under which it is proposed to retire S20J,-
COO.OdO of 7 per cent stock and issue $250,
000,000 of 5 per cent bonds, thereby in
creaeing the bonded debt from $300,000,000
jo $530,000,000.
Sir James Fortesque-Flannery, M. P.,
an associate of LJoyds, and former presi
dent of the Institution of Marine Engi
neers, takes a serious view of the situa
tion. He says the present movement is
part of a well defined scheme in Ameri
can mercantile and naval circles, the ulti
mate object of which is to foster Amin
can ship building. _fle sees in the new
ship building yards important factors in
the fast maturing project Tor enlarging
the American navy, v,'hich, he considers,
must inevitably be extended in proportion
to the present enormous enlargement of
the American mercantile marine.
Furthr questions in the House of Com
mons to-day on the subject of the ship
ping combine elicited information show
ing that the Government was taking
steps to cope with the situation, which
-evidently was officially considered detri
mental to Great Britain. The president
of the Board of Trade, Gerald Balfour,
said the Board of Trade had no orticial
information about the combine, but
plenty of unofficial intelligence had reach
ed the board. The effect of such a com
bination on British shipping generally
would receive the careful attention of the
board, but any informal inquiry would
be premature. No information regarding
the arrangements made by the Ameri
can syndicate to control the Atlantic
traffic, including passenger, freight and
other charges, and the movements of the
vessels largely belonging to British com
panies, had been submitted to the board
before the arrangements were made. As
to steps to secure the commercial and
political interests of the United.King
dom, and to prevent foreign interference
with British shipping:, conflicting with en
gagements made with the Admiralty, the
matter had occupied, and is occupying,
the Government's attention.
The Secretary of the Admiralty, reply
ing to Henry Norman. Liberal, said the
attention of the Admiralty had been
called to the formation of the Atlantic
shipping combine or trust, with a capi
tal of $170,000,000, mostly held in the
United States, and with registered offices
Ji Amorica - The Secretary was informed"
that twenty-eight British trans-Atlantic
eteamships were controlled by this com
Â¦ 3?. atlon> amoD 5 th em being three sub
sidized steamers and five others which
w fÂ» r if . x. a ' tl * e Admiralty's disposal,
without subsidy. The White Star line
gave the Admiralty no notice of its in
tention to enter the combination.
The "Westminster Gazette, however, so
laces itself with the thought that if the
law by which only American built ships
are entitled to fly the American flag is
repealed, the British, as ship builders,
stand to gain what they lose as ship
owners.
Shipping circles express satisfaction
with the announcement of Arnold-Foster,
Secretary of the Admiralty, of "the.ap
pointment of a committee to inquire into
the whole subject, as affecting the Ad
miralty. Much is made of the fact that
the Inman line steamers City of Paris
(now the American line steamer Phila
delphia) and the City of New York (now
the American line steamer City of New
York), after receiving $134,750 in subsidies,
were transferred to the American flag,
and it is contended that tUere is' noth
ing to prevent a repetition of such action.
LONDON, April 25.â The statements re
garding the intentions of the managers
of the Atlantic shipping combine vary
with each edition of almost every news
paper here, and most oÂ£ them entirely
lack even the semblance of authenticity;
but they serve to enhance the general
care which is fully voiced by the startling
newspaper posters and headlines. . .,
Neither of the Ministersâ Nicaraguan
or Costa Rlcanâ has yet received the full
powers from hia Government necessary
to the perfection of the treaties. â¢ ! v v
The original proposition was to pay a
lump sum representing the capitalization
of this rent for 100 years, but the repub
lics prefer to have the money paid yearly
in recognition of their sovereignty and In
consideration of the allowance of their
wish in this matter ;hey have gone to the
length of making the lease to the United
States perpetual as against the 100-year
renewable lease of the Colombian agree
ment.
No provision is made in the Colombian
protocol for the payment of any annual
rent. That matter will be left to future
adjustment, though, of course, it is ex
pected that some rent Â¦will bÂ« charged.
The agreements as to the Nicaraguan
canal, however, specifically state the rent
to- be paid, which is $30,000 per annum, of
which Nicaragua will get SS.000 and Costa
Rica $5000. While thi3 â¢ rent is merely
nominal, it serves a useful purpose in the
estimate of the isthmian republics, name
ly to continually assert the nominal sover
eignty of Nicaragua and Costa Rica over
the territory through which the canal ia
cut. -
One point of resemblance is the amount
of money to be paid down at onco by the
United States Government to the coun
try making the concession. In each case
this is S7.WO.000. If the Panama route is
chosen Colombia gets all of this money.
If the choice falls on the Nicaragua route.
Nicaragua will receive IS, 000,000 and Costa
Rica Sl.OOd.OOO. A good deal of the delay
that has Â¦ occurred in consummating the
arrangements was owing to the difficulty
in reaching a basis of division as between
Nicaragua and CoSta Rica and tils is gen
erally fixed upon as about six to one in
favor of Nicaragua.
A comparison of the outlines of the
agreements or treaties made by the State
Department with Colombia in relation to
the Panama canal and with Nicaragua
and Costa. Rica as to the Nicaragua
canal shows a general resemblance in the
scope of the arrangements, but important
differences in details.
"WASHINGTON, "April 25.â The Cabinet
held a short' session to-day, during which
the relative propositions or the Colombian
and Nicaraguan governments in connection
with the proposed canal were discussed.
Both propositions will be at once sub
mitted to Congress. The President is ex
ceedingly anxious, whatever determina
tion Congress may come to as to the rela
tive merits of the two routes, that some
decision may be reached at this session.

to see their pets play and then they lost.
The other two games were stopped by
the juicy state of the weather. If old
Sol will be kind and do the right thing
to-morrow morning, the Oakland grounds
will have such a crowd as used to fill the
old Piedmont ball field when the Qreen
hood & Morans were in their glory.
Bill Hanlon will again do stunts around
the Initial sack. He is in training and
Morley will use him as soon as the An
gels come North. Hanlon is one of tha
be3t first basemen in minor league com
pany and always a favorite. He has the
advantage of Streib in height, though he
has not got it on the little fellow a bit
in handling badly thrown balls. If Han
lon regains his lost batting eye, Morley' 3
team, will be a wonder.
little Mahler's work around second has
won for him a warm spot In the heart
of everyone who frequents Recreation
Park. The wee lad certainly plays a
great fast game in the field and he is a
scientific hitter. In the last series, ho
did over .300 per cent with the willow.
McHale, Meredith, Leahy and Holly
continue to be the idols of the stands
and bleachers. This quartet has done
the most effective work lately, all hit
ting well and fielding like stars.
' S hug-art did not show up so well in the
last five games he played. The Cap.
yearns for his old position at the* short
stop. When Harris gets another innelct
er the man from Chicago 'will again go
to short and will in all probability play
100 per cent better ball.
Old Slow Ball McPartlin made a record
a couple of weeks ago at Los Angeles
that can not be beat, and Is not likely to
be equaled. He did not allow Oakland a
single run or even a hit. This record has
only been made in the National Leagua
a few times in thirty years.
Manager Harris has his optics focused
on four or five performers who ha
thinks will soon stampede 'with tha
Ponies. One is a catcher, another an out
fielder.

in the race for the- flag and it looks
as though the Southern aggregation

Auditor Baehr takes exception to the
criticism of Chief of Police Wlttman" re
garding the estimate Baehr has made for

cient when they take into consideration
that many officers in the department are
being paid for police duty notwithstand
ing the fact that they are, doing mechan
ical- work, viz., repairing, carpentering,
plumbing, painting, etc., while others are
doing duty as prison-keepers, bailiffs

says further:
/The Chief Is misinformed when ho Â«ays that
the deDartment has not been Increased In ten
years. Not only has the number been In
creased, but the salaries have . been nUaed as

Both clubs have fairly large rolls of mem

best batting and bowling averages made
during the season by any member of the
four teams which take part in the
matches for premier position. Thougn

Next Thursday. May 1. there will be a
handicap over eighteen holes, medal play,
open to the members of any golf club on
the Pacific Coast, on the links of the San
Francisco Golf Club. Whenever it is pos
sible to do so, handicaps will be allotted
to each competitor according to his stand
ing in his own club.
The weather being dull and only a
small number of players appearing at the
links of the San Rafael Golf Club last
Saturday and Sunday, it was decided to
postpone the Best Ball handicap, which
was to have begun at 9 a. m., April 19
and closed at 6 p. m. to-day. Scores made
on last Saturday and Sunday, however
may be counted in the competition. It
is probable that the competition will be
gin to-day and continue until Saturday
May 3, and that the men's stroke compe
tition, open to all amateurs, and sched
uled for May 3, will be postponed for one
or two weeks.
The handicap tournament over eighteen
holes, match play, between Class A and
Class B teams, which was scheduled for
last Saturday on the links of the San
Francisco <jolf Club may take place next
Saturday. May 3.
The conditions under which the home
and-home matches have been played since
their institution in 1898 are that a tie shall
be played off on neutral links over eight
een holes. The tie resulting in that sea
son was so played off. In that year, as in
this, San Francisco won the first home
and-home match and lost the second. The
Oakland team won the eighteen-hole de
ciding match on the Burllngame links
and carried off the interclub trophy. This
year It was specially agreed between the
captains of tne two ciubs, S. L. Abbot
Jr., acting for the San Francisco. Golf
Club, and P. E. Bowles for the Oakland
Golf Club, that the deciding match should
be over thirty-six holes, and that none of
the members of either team should prac
tice over the course. John Lawson of the
San Francisco Golf Club and J. Athearn
Foiger of the Oakland Golf Club 1 were
excepted from this restriction, as they
are members of the Burlingame Country
Club. Both teams will consist of almost
exactly the same players as on Satur
day, April 12.
The tie resulting from the first two
36-hole matclrcs of this season between
teams representing the San Francisco and
the Oakland Golf clubs will be played off
to-day 'on the links of the Burllngams
Country Club.

The event of next week is the exhibi
tion matches to be played by the local
cracks at Penryn, Placer County. There
will be an excursion to the latter place.
The feature of the tournament will be the
tennis matches, between the Whitney
brothers, the Hardy brothers, Professor
Daily, W. B. Collier, H. W. Crowell and
Grant Smith. Parker Whitney, an en
thusiast, has . offered prizes for all the
events. The Porter brothers, champions
of Northern .California, are anxious to
meet the local cracks and it will prob
ably be arranged for them, to do so. The
players will leave here Friday .afternoon
and will play their matches On Saturday
afternoon and Sunday morning and after
noon. In the double the Hardys and wnit
neys will probably come together and Col
lier and Crowell and Daily and Smith. In
singles the matches have not as yet been
arranged.
The annual tournaments for the cham
pionship of Ojai "Valley, together with the
interscholastlc championship of South
ern California, were started at that place
on Thursday and will be completed to
day. The only local entry was Mrs. Kln
cald of Alameda and she was unfortunate
enough to. draw Miss May Sutton. the
coast champion. The latter had no dif
ficulty in winning, the score being 6â2,
6â0. Miss Ruby Garland is the present
champion, but Miss Sutton is sure to
wrest the championship honors from her.
The intercollegiate matches of last Sat
urday showed the Stanford people clear
ly that unless they build suitable courts
on the college ground the tennis cham
pionship will in future go to California.
The cardinal has, good material, but it
can never be brought out unless courts
are Iriiilt that are fit to play on. Harry
Weihe, besides being: out of practice, was
extremely nervous and did not do himself
justice last/ Saturday. Hunt was in fine
form and played the best game he has
ever put up. Cleve Baker of Stanford
made a very good showing and -will un
doubtedly develop into a first-class man.

promise. ' Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦*
In the first class the following park ex
perts will figure: Harry Routh, Charles
Dunlap, James A. Code, Thlerbault, Tet
ley, Will Allen and possibly some of the
cracks of the California Tennis Club.
Should the latter be invited to take part
the probable entries would be Harold Cro
well, W. B. .Collier and Grant Smith.
While the latter are more skillful than the
park players on asphaltum courts, on the
earth courts their chances are about even.
In the second class there will prpbably
be twenty men to struggle for the honors.
be divided into two classes, first and
â¢second. The prizes will be two silver
challenge cups, to be won three times.
Each player will be charged an entrance
fee of 50 cents in. each tournament and in
this way the cups will be paid for. As
there will be a large entry list in each
event, some valuable trophies will be put
up. Only those entering the first tourna

subsequent ones. -''.:': ' ".

When Judge Cranfleld eliminated dogs
from consideration in the various classes,
without exception those remaining in the

the winning dog is built on sightly lines.
The exception was J. H. Rosseter's odd

been coursed, but carried everything be

Lawler's phenomenal catches of two
long files at the center field fence saved
the game for San Francisco. In both In
stances he was back against the fence and
caught the ball with one hand at arm's
length. The home players fell on Kane's
delivery in the ninth inning, and that
they failed to win then was due -to
Roach's attempt to stretch' a single Into
a two-bagger. He was barely caught out
at second and shut out Reilley on a run
that would have tied the score. Attend

Defeat the Seraphs in a Game of Many
Exciting Features.
LOS ANGELES, April 25.â San Fran
cisco won from Los Angeles to-day In a
game of many unusual and exciting fea
tures. That Los Angeles did not win was
due partly to careless base running and
partly to Slagle's failure to take care of
bunted balls. In fact, it was a game that
might have been won or lost at any one
of a half-dozen stages. Slagle pitched
good ball as far as hits countedTT>ut failed
to field two bunts in his territory after he
had given a base on balls and hit a bat
ter. Thus he was responsible for two
runs. Reilly was twice put out while try-
Ing to stretch his hits, once at the home
plate and once at third.

AWARDS OP THE JUDGES.
The "best four of any breed" was the
next class called up. When It came to a
show-down it was found that J. H. Ros
seter held four aces. His greyhounds,
which have been one of the features of
the show, secured the votes of five out
of the six judges. Mrs. Klein's bull ter
riers were placed second and a quartet of
cocker spaniels third. Â»
This afternoon there wjll be a parade
of all prize-winners at 3 o'clock. In the
evening the cups and medals will be dis
tributed among the lucky winners.
George S. Thomas of Boston was finally
chosen as a referee. As he is essentially
a terrier man it seemed a foregone con
clusion ho would name the bull terrier.
He did not do so, however, casting the
deciding vote In favor pf the St. Bernard,
thus upholding Major Rathbone and Mr.
Cranneld. .
After eliminating all but three dogs from
the competition the judges, six in num
ber, â¢ came to a deadlock. Major J. L.
Rathbone and Mr. Cranneld voted for
Mrs. ,Charles Newman's St. Ber/iard, Les
ter C; Ho Yow and Dr. Clayton voted for
Mrs. Klein's bull terrier, Woodcote Won
der, while Mr. Carnochan and Mr. David
son voted for the Japanese spaniel. >
The judges refused to reverse themselves
and when It finally became a choice be
tween the massive St. Bernard and the
dainty Japanese spaniel â¢ Ho Yow, 1 - who Is'
always diplomatic, suggested '. that each
receive a prize. Owing to the marked
difference between the dogs this seemed
reasonable, but under the inexorable rules
of the kennel club was impossible.
The first exciting event and one of the
most interesting of the show was tho
judging for the best dogs owned and ex
hibited in the ring by. a lady. Among tho
competitors were a toy black and tan,. St.
Bernard,- collie, Irish terrier, bull terrier,'
Great Dane, Boston terrier, maltese ter
rier and Japanese spaniel. Â¦ ; ..

In the thirteenth the early part of the round
was full of earnest infighting; each man play
ing for the body. In this round Walcott sent
an uppercut to the chin, through a clinch, that
shook up Â¦ Gardner badly. Almost Immediately,
afterward Walcott sent a left to the Jaw that
would have been bad for Gardner had It landed
fairly.
The fourteenth was fast and hard. Walcott
was after Gardner and there was a lot of
hitting In the clinches. Both men played for
the body, winding up the round with a fast
rally. â¢
When they were shaping up for the fifteenth
It was the concensus of opinion at the ring
side that it was a good "draw" up to . that '
time. Gardner in trying for a right to the
body slipped to the ring floor, but. was up im
mediately. Walcott sent a right to the head
and got one in return on the body. Gardner
missed a desperate attempt at a right swing.
Walcott hung on at the end of the round to
avoid punishment. .
Walcott was the aggressor again in the six
teenth, a left to the ear and* another to Card-.
ner'a sore eye doing the Lowell man no good.
Walcott sent a left to the head and , another
The eleventh round was fast and hard. Wal
cott ' was the aggressor and one of his blows
fairly. lifted Gardner off the floor. Both were
slugging hard when the end of the round
came.
Gardner came back strongly In the tenth,
and after Â¦ landing two stiff uppercuts, under
the guard, on Walcott's head, the latter seemed
to have all he wanted of the argument. Gard
ner ended proceedings with a right and left to
the body.
GARDNER STR01JG IN TENTH.
Walcott forced Gardner to the ropes in thÂ»
ninth but did not hurt him. | Walcott tcx.k one
blow in the face which seemed a har.1 one.
but he only laughed and said "It's lovely."
Gardner presented anything but a pleasing; ap
pearance with his red face, swollen nose and
ruffed lips. Gardner'* left eye showed a blue
circle about it and seemed to be on the verge
of closing.
In the eighth Walcott seemed much the
stronger. Gardner bled freely from the nose
and mouth. Early In the round there was a
quick exchange which sounded like a tattoo on
a drum.
They fought all over the ring In the sev
enth.' but neither seemed able to land an ef
fective blow. It was give and take throughout
the round. Â¦Â«w
GEORGE GARDNER, the Lowell
boxer, turned the^tables on Joe Wal
cott last night in Woodward's Pa
vilion. He was given the decision
over his old opponent by Referee E. J.
Smith after one of the most desperate
contests ever seen in this city.
There was hardly a. moment from first
to last when the fighters were not at one
another hammer and tong3. At times the
blows each received sounded like a blow
on a tightly bound drum. Although Gard
ner receive the decision on his aggressive
ness and clean blows it was by so nar
row a. margin that a draw decision would
undoubtedly have given more general sat
isfaction. This applies- especially in this
case owing to the rumors that the con
test was fixed. =X",
To allay these reports Billy Jordan an
nounced that the Yosemite Club manage
ment bad authorized Referee Smith, to
call off all bets if he saw any- sign of a
job. It was also announced that if a Job
developed the fighters' share of the re
ceipts would be given some charitable In
stitution. <i;';'
Charity never had a look In.
For three rounds some of the spectator*
thought the men were not trying, but at
the end of that time the scoffers had
Joined the shouters and were using their
lung powers to cheer Instead of jeer.
WALOOTT A MARVEL.
Walcott re-established himself la thÂ«
good graces of the ring patrons. ' It
seemed cruel to put him against the bis
man, but once they cleared for action tha
disparity in their size seemed to disappear.
Walcott will always remain the marvel of
the modern prize ring.
In the early stages of the fight Gardner
tried fighting at close range, but Walcott
would not give him an opportunity to
shape up and prepare to deliver a blow.
The colored wonder was first out of reach
and a moment later he was under his op
ponent's guard, as safe from, harm as
though he were at home playing whist.
Walcott was never still, keeping boring
in at all times, and Gardner did not seem
to be able to hurt him. After a while
Gardner tried long-range fighting, which
proved much more effective than his other
tactics. In the fifth round he cut Wal
cott's mouth. After that he paid particu
lar attention to the injured spot. He
landed some uppercuts under Walcott a
guard in a clinch. This was the blow
with which he whipped Carter last Sep
tember.
Walcott proved no novice at this, per
forming the same trick on Gardner. The
latter was badly punished about the face.
His nose and lips were puffed up and his
eyes discolored and apparently ready to
close. In the eighth round it seemed
Gardner was on the down grade, but he
pulled himself together and put up a
strong finish.
The nineteenth and twentieth rounds
were whirlwind affairs.- bringing the spec
tators to their feet. The last round was
desperate going for Walcott. who palp
ably weakened under the shower of blows
he received. ,_, , _.Â«.
Gardner was swinging pitilessly witn
right and left, every blow going unerring
ly to its mark. Walcott finally went down
under the hall of blows which {ell about
his head. _ i
In his excitement Gardner swung at
him while he was down, landing a. left
to the face. Â¦â¢ The blow was a technical
foul, but as no damage resulted the ref
eree properly took no notice of it. Wal
cott was chagrined over the outcome of
the fight While arguing the question.
with Referee Smith the police entered the
ring and stopped the unprofitable discus
sion. The attendance was not In keeping
with the quality of the fight. , s i .
THE FIGHT BY ROUNDS. .
When the gong sent the men -together la
the first round Gardner at one* went after
Walcott and did some fast feinting This did
not trouble the colored man. who was the
first to land, sending his left to the body^harij.
Gardner came back with a left lab and Walcott.
getting under his guard, hung on. Gardner
rent a right to the body and took a right on
the bead. Gardner sent a straight right to tfea
'in* the second round Gardner continued his
feinting but Walcott was in and out sofas'.
he could not land an effective blow for a timÂ«.
Gardner finally sent the right to the body,
which shook up Walcott. Walcott landed a
chop blow with his left to the head and fol
lowed It with a swinging left to the body.
Walcott sent a right to the bead and took a
stiff right to the head in return, Gardner
again played for the body, using both right
and left. Â¦ This round was fast throughout.
In the third round Gardner was the first to
land planting his right and left to the body,
following with a right to the. head, which
cfcraed hard, but Joe only laughed at him.
-The men stood In the middle of the ring and
had a veritable slugging match, each landing
right and left swings without attempting to
cuard. When they slowed down Gardner
commenced his play with right and left to the
body again. Walcott came back with two
stlK lefts to the head.. Gardner toward th*
end of the round tried his best for an upper
cut.
Walcott opened proceedings In the fourth
with a hard left to the head. - Gardner landed
right to the head, but Walcott only laughed
at his efforts. . Walcott was forcing Gardner
around the ring the remainder of the round.
Just before the bell Gardner tried' a terrtflo
right cross, which barely missed its mark.
Walcott's right shoe was badly torn in this
round and Â¦ he removed It. fighting several
rounds before It was replaced by another shoe.
Gardner overreached hfmself at the open
ing of the fifth round and stumbled. Ha quick
ly recovered and sent a right to. the body.
Walcott sent a left to the head and followed It
up with a second one. Gardner landed a right,
but missed with his left immediately afterward.
In this round Gardner cut Walcott's mouth
badly. It bled rather freely. When they went
together in the sixth Gardner commenced to
play at once for the injured mouth. He varied
this with rights to the body, landing three In
succession. These did not worry Walcott. who
came back for more all the time. The round
ended with Walcott landing rights and lefts
to the head.
The deadlock remained intact until in
ning seven rolled around. Devereaux flew
to , left field and Dunleavy hit hard against
the right garden fence for- two bags.
Francks brought him in with a hot
grounder past third. The Senators had a
few chances to -win, but somehow or
other they could not get their hits bunch
ed and the Oaklands. refused to make, any
more errors. " \
Hodson pitched remarkable ball. The
sphere was banged around quite freely,
but Hoddie always managed to pull out
without any serious damage. Thomas
twirled in ideal form. He used good Judg
ment, had nice curves and an ample sup
ply of speed. However, every hit the
commuters made was there at the right
moment and none of them were wasted.'
Sheehan hit the ball hard, and Bir
mingham did good work at first. Dunleavy
made a couple of pretty throws in from
left and cut off two runs. In the third
Eagan opened with a hit and Rebsamen
followed with a double to right. Eagan
could easily - have made the plate, but
Brick Devereaux prevailed upon' him to
slide and hold third, so Brick's tact saved
the game for Oakland* The score:

A summary of the various attractions of the dis
trict gives . these reasons why Reedley is a good
place for settlers: It is healthful; it offers a greater
variety of:* occupations than most places; the cli
mate is good; there is plenty of water for.<irriga
tion and the people own the system; good soil, with
no alkali; 'excellent railway . facilities and j-gobd
The products of the district are wheat, hay, -corn,
alfalfa, peaches, prunes, pears, apricots, olives, figs^
oranges, lemons, grapes of every variety and all
kinds of deciduous fruits. As illustrations of. the
profits that are' possible under favorable 'conditions
instances are cited of extraordinary incomes , from
orchards and vineyards; and names and addresses
are given of gentlemen who vouch for them. ~ '.
The folder is so small that it can â¢ be readily
placed in the envelope and sent out with every letter
that goes from Reedley to the outer world. "It is
therefore an effective means for general advertising
and will do much to make known the manifold attrac

Reedley claims to stand in the geographical center
of California. It is on the banks of Kings River, '
one of the finest streams, in the State, and has now
in operation an irrigation \ system covering ; .-.over
128,000 acres, '"every acre the equal of any other. in
its right to water, and costing less than'^50 cents per
acre per annum."
BY way of attracting the attention of the .pub
lic to the many . advantages of that section of
Fresno County the, Board of Trade of Reed
ley has published for general' circulation a Vfolder",
giving a terse compendium of such facts concerning
climate, soil,; industry and educational 'facilities as
will be interesting to persons seeking for new homes
or for profitable investments for capital. r i*;-%V

Among the citizens' of Massachusetts who are try

for. the erection of a statue to' General Butler is a
man who urges the appropriation oh the ground that
the general once saved his. life, and now the Massa
chusetts Solbns are' pondering whether 'such service
merits an equestrian statue or a. small. leather medal.
It is stated that more than half of all the : news
papers in the world^are -printed in -English, and iri
the United States newspapers are printed in twenty-,
four different languages. : It thus appears that. while
the English have been scattering themselves all over
the world io a journalistic way we have been absorb
ing everything into out^own country. If' newspapers
in evtry other part of the globe were suppressed the'
United. States could furnish every race with a live
journal printed in^ its ' own language.
Â¦ VI â¢ am astonished that : these f earf ullyÂ«
wrought-up â¢ journals' have no word" of
commendation - ' for Â¦. our soldiers * In the
-Philippines, -who have - suffered untold
cruelties, assassinations, burning by .slow
Â¦fires, burial alive, mutilations and atroci
ties, who have submitted 'to every indig
nity without resentment -or.V complaint,'
and -I have been greatly,: gratified - over
their Â¦ excellent . behavfor under -such try
ing circumstances. 'In . their comments
these journals are very careful not to say
why these punishments are given to such
traitors, knowing , well .: if they â¢ did. our
people. would look, upon the acts as one
of the necessities of war.^and would.won

'.'The*, testimony of Sergeant Rlley, upon
which you base your attack on these offi
cers, goes' to prove.. that they.;- gave the
: water cure to Â¦ a Filipino - who . had been
made presidente' in one of the provinces,
by . our Government, "who had '.taken the
oath of allegiance, to our country 1 and
then used his official position to cover his
acts as captain of an insurgent company
which .'was acting In .arms against our
army;, within our lines. Therefore, he ,wa^
a traitor and a' spy, and his every act
was -a* violation of the laws, of .war, and
branded him an outlaw and guerrilla. It
these are the acts, under the usages of
'war these officers were justified in what
they -did;, inVfact, if they had shot the
traitor they would never have been called
to account, and an all probability this is
'what would have happened to him in the
civil war. , â¢Â¦ \f\ ; ..W . ' ~
<v An officer has great latitude under
such circumstances, and it is not safe or
fair to condemn one for almost any act
that detects a traitor ; and spy in arms
against the " Government which he . haa
. sworn to protect, and which has put him
in a position . of trust. You ignore entirely
this side of. the. question! and only treat
Major. Glenn's acts as cruelties to peace
able Filipino - citizens. .1 can remember
when the journals of this country upheld
and applauded ' an- officer who, -in the
civil war, ordered a man shot if he at
tempted to haul down the American flag,
and" cannot- understand the present hys
tarics of some journals over the terrible
violation of the laws of war in punishing
a traitor caught in the act with the water
cure only. The treatment may have been
severe, but it is not permanently harmful..

NEW YORK, April 25.â The following
Wt&SORAL " MENTION!
Here, then, arc opportunities to reap a profit upon
every dollar expended in advertising the State. The
profits, moreover, will be widespread. The * up
building of the interior by the development of its re
sources and the increase of its pbpuIatioVi will aug
ment the trade, increase the wealth and add to the Â¦
growth of San l ? rancisco itself.- Since all are.. to
share in the benefits it is but fair to, expect that all
will contribute to ths cost of obtaining them. - The
promotion movement is in the hands of good and
competent men. There can be no question that
the money intrusted to them will be expended to the
greatest advantage of all. It is t^"be hoped, then,
that the contributions to the fund will be liberal and
prompt, and that a very, large proportion of the
people. will be -among Xhe "contributors.. ~ r
Money, however, is by no means, the only nor the
most important contribution which the East* can
furnish us at this time to hasten the development
of the State. In that section of the Union there are
thousands of industrious, thrifty* and- well-to-do
families who are seeking new homes. A migratory
impulse is at present felt throughout the wfcole
population north of the Ohio from the Atlantic to
the Missouri Our Eastern exchanges announce, that
the movement is the most notable since the great
migration that settled up the States of Nebraska
and Kansas. Thousands of the best kinds of Ameri
can farmers are migrating even to the Canadian
northwest. There is a chance, therefore, of profiting
by this high tide of migration by attracting much of
it to 'our own sparsely settled counties, where the
climate and soil are so much superior to any- to be
found elsewhere.
There is not a county in California that has not
some rich' resource of wealth lying undeveloped.
Large quantities of raw material are shipped out of
the State in that form, or perhaps not shipped at all,
which might be. Iprofitably worked up into finished
forms for the market? and at the same time an
abundant water power is running almost idly to the
sea for' the lack of use in application to machinery. '
Furthermore, the abundant output of. oil now offers
cheap fuel for all kinds, of manufacturing, and noth
ing is needed be3'ond the â¢' capital required for .Â£he
enterprise and the right men to manage . the work.
Comparatively few Californians . understand manu
facturing business, and $o we must rely largely upon.
Eastern leadership in the undertaking of such enter
prises, but we must at least make known the possi-(
bilitics of manufacturing and attract the attention
of investors to- them. . .
vestments are now being made by New York and
Chicago millionaires in Europe. That money
and the energy which controls and directs it can be
drawn to California if an intelligent and compre
hensive report be made of the Â¦ opportunities for
profitable investment that exist here in this great
undeveloped territory of Northern California. >â¢'.
BY the California Promotion Committee it is
estimated that fully $5000 . a month as a
steady income will be required to carry out
on anything like an adequate scale the work of -at-,
tracting the attention of investors and settlers to the
advantages offered in the counties north -of Teha
chapL The estimate is moderate and will so appear
to every one who v.ill give consideration either to
the %vealth of the community to which the appeal is
made or to the vast benefits which will result from
the work. Moderate... as it is, however, it is a sum
too large to be expected of any one class of the peo
ple. All who are to benefit by the work ought in pro
portion to their means to contribute to the funds
required to carry it on.
The advantages now offered for the enterprise of
upbuilding Northern Â¦ California are- well' known.
The Eastern cities have millions of surplus capital
seeking investment. In default of better, large in-

' . It is with such evidence as that before them that
the 'advocates of reciprocity continue to talk about
our duty to relieve"rthe. starving Cubans. It is surely
a. poor bill that 1ias; T to'.be bolstered/ up 'with such
tale's as that and- such appeals'to the credulity v of the
charitable. . . Â¦ â¢.',.-, -,-Â¦ Â¦'?;Â£& W^ - -
A vital point'in the situation is thus presented' by
the orator: "There is a piece of evidence which to
my.: mind -shows beyond any question whatever that
up to the present- time there has been absolutely 'no
loss and that there will be no. loss in .the future upon
sugar. It has been testified that wages have Â¦ ad- 1
v'anced in the island from 50 to 75 per cent during
the' last .two. years. Now I never in my life heard of
a. case, where a country was upon the verge of bank
ruptcy, where . its business was about; to fail, where
the business men were not making profits, but where
the rate of wages had risen as they have, in Cuba.
The best barometer of business prosperity of any
industry" is the wages paid to its laborers. ..Another
fact : It appears from testimony that the amount Of
sugar produced in Cuba has been steadily â¢ increas
..ing. .'Â¦ Two years ago the amount produced was about
300,000 tons... The crop of this year whenfully gath
ered will amount to 850,000 "tons'." . . . ' â¢
Passing to of the prospects of the
sugary planters? 'Mr. Sutherland-- cited testimony be-"
fore the committed Â¦'showing thai^in Cuba they raise
about twenty-five tons of sugar cane to the acre,
yielding about 5600 pounds of sugar. -The cost of
producing the sugar averages a^out ij^ cents a
pound, and in some localities it is 1% cents a pound.
The- lowest price that Cuban sugar has ever, been
sold for of recent years at. the Cuban ports is $1 : 8i
per hundred. Even at that price planters get a
profit of 31 cents, per hundred, or about 20 per cent
of the total cost of, production.
Another whness; Colonel Bliss, said: "It is long
since I have seen any one" -begging on the streets,
or any one who wished work who was not at work
at good wages.'v ~."r ''Â¦" â¢'-";' ' .''. ''
Further quotations from the advocates of the re
ciprocity scheme repeat the' same story. Mr. Men
ddza said: "The military government has .attended
to the sanitary; situation of the.ishnd. It has im
proved a good deal^;.;but .the 'stomachs of the ; peo^
pie- are empty, and I'^-fear : 'the '.consequences of the
reconcentration policy^of -.General Weyier i are going
to come up again in a different way." ' ;"â¢
;'That same Mendoza when cross-examined by the
committee admitted. in- reply to direct
"AH the sugar plantations are working) at. this time.
There is plenty of wprk'l.for ; workmen" in Cuba.
Common Iab9rers are now. receiving as' high as $30
a month, andvin some localities they receive more."
Â¦He added : ; ' condition . of stah r ation does not
exist now, but^e" fear it will exist." %:Â¦:'Â¦Â¦â¢'
.Mr. Sutherland began by quoting :-j{rom'.! an '"ap-'
-pear' made by the Cuban .Planters' Association:
"The cry has^come up from. all over. the island, 'Save
,_or we perish.' It- has^corhe'from the official heads

say : ' 'We cannot stand by and see : the'.'.' landyj for ;

'.The Westminster, Gazette reports the discovery of.
a new species of swindler in Scotland Known as -the
"penny bookmaker." These rascals prowl -about -the;
streets inducing .newsboys and school children tobet"
pennies on tiorsejeaces,. and it Js~said they, have -been:
especially numerous^ and successful 'in -Edinburgh.
We have had ".some pretty^ mean' pool-sellers. /'and*;
bookmakers among the youth "of this city, .but: never :
anything like this. Â¦] San Francisco should sendmisj-,.
sionaries to Edinburgh to give lessons in morality. :
The men whom Herrin has employed to make the
fight for Gage are skilled in every trick and-strata
gem known to politics. In any and every country
where they deem it likely that they can gain dele
gates.by having them appointed they will endeavor
to have the appointments made. They will evade the
rank and file of the party wherever they are. Even
when the holding of primaries is forced upon "them
they will bring the Democratic push to Republican
primaries^for the purpose of defeating true Repub
licans. Thus there is danger at every point in the
campaign. ..The greatest danger, however, is that of
leaving the selection of Â¦delegates to the bosses. ' At
the primaries honest Republicans have at least a
chance; ; Jiut if the: delegates be appointed there will
be in many counties a cinch for Billy Herrin. ' ; - : '
Should the .convention be made up of Republicans
chosen at primary elections by Republican votes
it would . be honestly : representative. Its actions
would have the indorsement and support^tfi all true
Republicans, and the party, harmonious and united,
would go into the campaign assured of victory. If,
on the other hand, it should happen that' a host of
Herrin's tools are appointed to the convention by
men who are more desirous of doing machine poli-'
tics than of. advancing true Republicanism, the dan
ger, of defeat will be. imminent. It is well known
that thousands of stalwart Republicans will not sup
port a ticket dictated by a boss, nor a ticket carried
through the convention by trickery. The welfare of
the party is therefore dependent upon the election
of an honestly representative State convention. ,
For the purpose of guarding against the Gage
scheme â¢ the leaders of genuine ; Republicanism in.
every section of the State should at once begin to
rouse the -people to a. sense of the danger that con
fronts the party in this scheme of the corporation
henchmen. All true Republicans '.should be united
in the demand "for open â¢primaries honestly con
ducted. The right of every Republican '.. to have a .
voice and a vote in the selection of the delegates who
are to represent him in, the State convention, should
be insisted upon. There should be no cajnpromise
on the subject.
Â¦ ;It will be readily perceived that if Herrin can get
a considerable number of delegates appointed ;to the
convention he will have a formidable position in' that
body. .-The men whom the allied bosses wilLappoint
will' be,' absolutely subservient to the Democratic
corporation attorney. They will have, no minds of
their own nor any object to serve other than that
of .the will ' of the .bosses. Herrin will be able to
use* them in making any kind of trade he chooses.
They will be pawns in his hands, and the State will
be presented Â¦ with the spectacle of a Democratic
boss employed, as a railroad attorney, dictating ' to
California Republicans in a State convention.
The' issue, it will be seen, runs beyond the State:
Central Committee to the majority of Republicans
in all counties that are not under, the operation of
the primary law. It will' therefore ..be useless for;
gjenuine Republicans to rely altogether^ upon the
Central Committee. The recommendations of ' that
body will undoubtedly have weight, and there is no'
question but what the Gage bosses will try to pre
vent the committee from- recommending primaries.
Still the action of the committee one way or the
other" will not *be fikal. The fight for genuine / Re
publicanism-must be carried on in every county
where" the bosses have a chance to appoint dele
gates. Vigilance will be needed from now on, for the
bosses are- playing for big stakes this time and will
be tireless : in their energies as well as unscrupulous
in the means- they employ, to achieve success.
WHILE it is a duty incumbent upon the Re
publican State Central Committee to- take
steps to baffle 'the gang who. are trying to
put the Democratic railway boss, Billy: Herrin, in
control of the State convention, the rank and file
of the party must not rely wholly upon the com
mittee. As a matter of fact the committee can.do no
more than make recommendations as to the method
of choosing delegates to the convention. With the
exception of the localities' that are under the opera
tion of the primary law, the party : officers in. each
county can make such arrangements as' they choose
for the selection of delegates, and the convention it
self will be the final judge of the qualifications of its
members. Consequently no' matter how 1 earnestly
the 'State -Committee may recommend the- holding
of. primary j elections, the Gage bosses' may yet ap
point their henchmen in many, counties unless the
rank and Ale of the party % are resolute not to. sub
mit to such ââ¢ action. : ., â¢. . . Â« . \

"What 1 propose to do," said Judge
'Lindsey, "is to make the fee large enough
to make it worth an attorney's time to at
tend ' to the/ case and then I shall insist
upon a vigorous defense.
"In the past I have frequently In
structed the jury not to believe the plain
tiff when I was satisfied in my mind that
the testimony given was not all true and
to refuse the divorce. The court Is too
often imposed upon in these divorce cases
and it is a disgrace to humanity. -The
time of the court is taken up and people
are led to believe that all they . have to
do is to file .their bill and the court will
do the rest."

His plan is simple enough. The recog
nized fee of an attorney appointed for the
defense is $10.' Judge Lindsey proposes to
raise this fee to 550 or $100 and insist on a
vigorous defense. The. fee for the defend
ant's attorney is paid by the plaintiff,
who is glad to secure the divorce with
but little opposition.'

Grand-Niece of Ex-President James
K. Polk, Writes to Mrs. Pinkham.
â â i
Thankful for Health Restored hy Lydia E. Pinkham f 3
Vegetahle .Oompoiind.
Did you ever stop to realize what keen satisfaction one experiences -when
we find that some kind and helpful thing, we have done for some one else has
been sincerely appreciated ! At such times, how truly we understand the ex-
pression " it is more blessed to gire than to receive." , ,L r^.l .!;Â¦
Think, therefore', of the pleasure and genuine satisfaction Mrs. Finkham
experiences when such letters come to her as the one from Mrs. Roser which
we are herewith permitted to publish.
Think what it means to her ; it means first, that one more lovely woman
has been relieved from sickness and distress through her assistance ; it means
second, that this woman who is cured is so grateful that she wants other
women in the land to know of it ; and it means lastly, that Mrs. Pinkham's
claims for Ijydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound are fully sub-
stantiated by testimony of such high character that every woman who reads
this must believe and hope. -"Â¦>
To be appreciated is a great pleasure, but to bring peace and happiness to
the suffering is heavenly. Such is the mission of Mrs. Pinkham, and such a
letter as the following proves her success 1

" The value of L.ydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was
called to my attention by an intimate friend, whose life had simply been
a torture with inflammation and laceration, and a few bottles of your
Compound cured her: she can hardly believe it herself today, she en-
joys such blessed health. I took four bottles of your Compound and
consider myself cured., I am once more in fine health and spirits ; my
domestic and official duties all seem easy now, for I feel sa strong I can
do three times what I used to do. You have a host of friends in Den-
ver, and among the best count, Yours very gratefully,â Mks. Ida L.

Hewitt is a well-known capitalist and
was at one time the president of the
Board of Delegates, which is the lower
house of the city legislature. He was
once the husband of the woman whom he
is now accused of stealing from the
plaintiff. Fickus is a steamboat engineer
and is employed on one of the California
Navigation and Improvement Company's
boats, plying between San Francisco and
Stockton. He has not lived in San Diego
since 1897, that being the year of his al
leged domestic troubles. . Hewitt has lived
here until recently and' Is the owner of,
much property in this city. Mrs. Fickus,
who was formerly Mrs. Hewitt, is propri
etress of the Albion lodging-house, .which
was deeded to her by Hewitt at the time
of their separation. . '
ThÂ« complaint recites that P. J. Fickus
and Catherine T. Fickus were married on
December 22, 1895, and that she continued
to be his wife until June, 1900, the date
of their divorce. Fickus being an engi
neer, his duties called him away Irom
home much of the time. In December,
1897, he left San Diego for San Francisco
and Sacramento. Soon after his arrival
there, the complaint alleges, he received
a letter from Mrs. Fickus saying that he
need not send her any more money, as
she had all she needed, and upon these
representations he stopped sending ner
money. The charge is made that in the
months of January, February, March.
April and May, 1900, Hewitt promised
Mrs Fickus that if she would procure a
divorce from the plaintiff he would give
her $20 a month for her use; that he
would provide her with a horse* and bug
gy; that in his will he would bequeath
to her one-fourth of his estate, and that
he would bequeath the remainder to the
two children born of their marriage. It
is said that the Hewitt estate in San
Diego city and county is worth ?65,0w. it
is set forth in the complaint that Hewitt
threatened to disinherit the children if
she did no get the divorce from the plain-
The divorce was granted in June, 1900.
The plaintiff says that the reason he did
not bring suit before was that he has but
recently learned of the facts as contained
in the complaint. Hewitt is now a resi
dent of Los Angeles and the case will be
taken to that city on a change of venue.
SAN DIEGO, April 25.â P. J. Fickus has
brought suit in Â¦ the Superior Court
against D. H. Hewitt for damages in the
sum of $20,000 for the alienation of his
wife's affections.

LOS ANGELES, April 25.â J. R. Craw

said he had just arrived in Los Angeles
and gone to a hotel, where he had taken a
bath. When he left the bathroom he
missed his waistcoat, containing a watch
and chain. He was positive that he had
not left the hotel before discovering his
loss,- nor had he gone to any other place
than his own room.
Last evening a telephone message was

ABSENT-MINDED
ACTOR'S SCARE
Special Dispatch to The Call,
FRESNO, April 25.â Dr. George Ed
wards, one of the best known livery men
and veterinaries in Fresno, was convicted
this afternoon of an attack on a 14-year
old girl. His trial took place in Judge
Austin's court and lasted five days. The
Jury arrived at Its verdict in just eleven
minutes.
Edwards, whose real name is Mathews,
was arrested as the result of some clever
work on the part of the Fresno Police De
partment. Several months ago two little
girls, both under 14, ran away from home
and upon being brought back made start
ling revelations to the police. From hints
gained from them. Jesse Howard, a candy
etore keeper, was arrested and convicted.
The police had already begun to watch
Edwards, and one night they were re- ,
warded by seeing two little girls drive up
in a buggy to his stable, one of them
petting out, and the other driving around
to a nearby stable, where she left the
rig and then returned. Both of the girls
were in the stable for some time, going
thence to a lodging-house. There the of
ficers arrested them and gained a com
plete confession, implicating Edwards.
The latter was arrested. Officer McDon
ald was detailed on the case by Chief
Morgan, and he wove a net around Ed
wards from which -escape 'was impossible.
The horse doctor Â¦ had considerable prop
erty, which he had converted into cash
for his ball and was contemplating flight.
McDonald learned of this and -tie evi
dence of it was introduced in the trial.
Edwards had already procured hair dye
to disguise himself, but he remained in
Kresno on the advice of his attorney.
The victim of Edwards' crime was Mary
Kuhn. aged 14 years. She told her story
on the stand in a simple, straightorward
way. The defense put on but a few wit
nesses, simply trying to prove that the
character of the girl was bad and that
Edwards had frequently told her to stay
awa.y from his barn. Edwards did not
testify.
An effort probably will be made to ob
tain a new trial.

Kiuchi talked with those about him up
to the last. Fifteen minutes before his
death he told his nurse that he felt bet
ter. He seemed, however, to realize that
his end might be near, for he asked his
countrymen to ship his body to hia par
ents in Japan In case of death.
Dr. Brown, acting as coroner, retained
the heart, and will preserve it, to show
hew it is possible for man to survive, at
least for one day, with a great gaping
hole through his heart.
TACOMA, April 25.-S. Kiuchi, a young
Japanese shot on . Wednesday night in a
disreputable resort, died in the Fannie
Paddock Hospital last night. A post mor
tem examination revealed the fact that
the bullet in Kiuchi's breast had passed
completely through hla heart, tearing a
weund nearly three inches in length
through the heart muscles. Three physi
cians who conducted the autopsy were
astounded when their examination had
reached a point where the heart was re
vealed. The bullet had entered the breast
between the third and fourth ribs and
penetrated the heart and left lung. -
The great hole In the heart was through
the muscles near the left ventricle, none
of the chambers of the vital organ having
been penetrated. Ordinarily death must
have ensued instantly, "or within a very
few minutes, from a wound of the char
acter of that Inflicted upon Kiuchi, yet
the young Japanese lived almost twenty
two hours, was conscious most of the
time, and conversed freely with his at
tendants and with callers of his own na
tivity.

to Gardner's body. Gardner seemed to be
slowing up. somewhat after the fast pace, but
still did the moat effective work at the end. oX
The seventeenth round was a repetition of
this, Walcott being the aggressor at the early
part, while Gardner was much the better at
the finish. The round ended in a sensational
slugging match. -,''.'". â¢ â¢ . Â»,_
Gardner landed right and left early In the
eighteenth and took a right and left to the
body in return. This round also ended In a
S "valcott lifted Gardner off his feet again in
the nineteenth. Gardner tried to stand him
off- but it seemed Impossible, the little colored
boxer going at a great pace. A left to the
body seemed to hurt Gardner considerably.
Both men took a lot of punishment.
The twentieth round was one of the most
sensational over seen in this city. The two
boxers went at each other like battering-rams.
There was no attempt at guarding,- each man
taking a chance of landing a blow that would
turn the tide of battle In his favor. Gardner
proved the more effective of the two and landed
right and left swings to the head and body in
rapid succession. One of these sent Walcott to
his knees and Gardner in the excitement of the
moment struck him in- the face while the col- i
ored man was In this position. As the blow
was obviously accidental and did no material
damage Referee Smith took no notice of it.
The bell sounded the end of the contest with
Walcott in ' distress after the terrible punish
ment he had received in the last round. The
referee pointed to Gardner at once. Walcott
seemed disheartened and tried to argue with
the referee, but Lieutenant of Police Anderson
and his men entered the ring and cleared it.
_ Preliminaries Are Fast.
Robbie Johnson stopped Willie Bourne
in the first round of their fight. Johnson
was the aggressor and showed a clever
left. He landed It three times on Bourne's
jaw. After they had been at it something
more than two minutes Johnson landed a
left rip to the stomach, which apparently
put' Bourne out of commission. His exit
was theatrical, leading 1 the spectators to
think he was not a3 hard hit as he ap
peared.
Jack Kane and Jack Dean started pro
ceedings at so fast a pace that it seemed
the end must come in the first round.
Kane had all the better of this round.
Dean took a hard punching, Ertan
was knocked down In the third,
taking eight seconds. In the early part
of the eighth Kane never gave his oppo
nent a rest, although he took some hard
rights and lefts to the head In return.
At the beginning of the tenth round
Referee Smith warned' them that it was
anybody's fight. Dean showed best in
the early part of the round, while Kane
was best at the wind-up. It was called a
draw, about the only thing the referee
could do.

PAINE'S CE1EBY COMPOUND.
After Years of Mental
and Physical Sufferings and
Failures With Ordinary
. Medicines,
Paine's Celery
Compound
Cures a Sonth Carolina
Gentleman.
This Marvelous Medicine Is
Heartily Indorsed by
the Ablest and Best
Physicians.
What a blessing it would be to human-
ity in general If all suffering men and
women knew just what Paine's Celery
Compound Is able to do.
The work that cannot be done for the
sick and suffering by months of experi-
menting with the common medicines of
the day, is successfully carrie'd to victory
by Paine's Celery Compound la. a few
short weeks.
The cure of Mr. Murph proves fully the
I assertion made above. After years of fail-
ures, misery, agony and despondency,
Paine's Celery Compound made a "new
man" of one who had become a mere
wreckâ one who was fast nearing the
grave.
Have faith, sufferer! You have a strong
deliverer at hand able to rescue and save
you. From to-day, let your hope be cen-
tered In Paine's Celery Compound and it3
mighty power to cure. It has never dis-
appointed any sufferer; it will not fall in
your case.
Mr. R. H. Murph, Rich, S. C, under
the direction of a kind Providence was led
to use the medicine that "makes sick peo-
ple well." His testimony is strong and
convincing. It shows unmistakingly that
Paine's Celery Compound is the true
health builder for weak, weary, sleepless
and iun-down people at this season. Mr.
Murph says:
"I have had nervous prostration for sev-
eral years. I was troubled almost con-
tinually with nervous headache, could not
sleep well, had become absent minded and
was considerably run down In flesh and
general health. A friend advised me to
try Paine's Celery Compound. I used four
bottles and am now in excellent health
and weigh more than I have for five
years, all of which I owe to Paine's Celery
Compound."

l||p|^i^ Why take sickening salts or repulsive
T^" castor oil? "Goes through you like a'
dose of salts"' means violence, grips, gripes, gases,
soreness, irritation, and leaves your stomach and bowels
weak and burnt out. Might just as well take concen-
trated lye. Then there's castor oil, disgusting, nauseat-

the taste. Fool your own stomach, eh? Don't ever
believe that, anything offensive to your taste or smell is
going to do you real good: Nature makes certain

PASADENA. April 25.â The American
Girl mine, near Ogflby. has been sold, to
the American Consolidated Mining Com
pany for about 51,000,000. The papers of

end J. W. Wood. The purchasers are
Denver and Chicago capitalists.
The object of his address, he said, was
to convince the Senate of the very great
importance of the subject to the Ameri
can people. For a quarter of a century
nearly every State in the Union had been
struggling with the question of procur
ing pure foods. Experience has proved
that it had been impossible to obtain uni
formity in State laws. This bill attempt
ed to regulate the sale of only such foods
se entered into interstate, commerce, and
Congress, therefore, had ample authority
to deal with the subject. He declared
that the extent of the adulteration and
tr.isbranding of food products was appall
iT:g; that the time had come for Congress
â¢o act. He enumerated many of the
frauds in food products, which, he said,
v.-ere crimes against the consumer and
merchant alike. The amount of deleter
ious foods placed on the market each
year, McCumber said, was valued at fully
Jl.170,000,000, while the total amount of
adulterated food products each year was
nearly Si ,000,000.000. He expressed the be
lief, based upon evidences taken by his
committee, that manufacturers and deal
ers generally would not object to the
enactment of the bill proposed.
WASHINGTON. April 25.â In the Sen
ate to-day McCumber of North Dakota,
chairman cf the Committee on Manufacs

adulteration, xnisbranding and imitations
of food, beverages, candies, drugs and

Buyers of the best meats, including the

they obtained loins at 15 cents and ribs
at 14 cents a pound. Rounds are sold at

where in the United States.
LOS ANGELES, April 25.â W. E. Rob
erte, Los Angeles manager of Cudahy &
Co., denied to-day that the Beef Trust
has extended its operations to Southern
California or that the high price of meats
In the local market is due to the '"trust."
Manager Roberts declared beef is lower
at this time here than it was a year ago,
and insisted that local wholesale dealers
are not in combination, but,- on the con
trary, so far as L*os Angeles is concerned,
competition is open.
CHICAGO, April 25. â Packers place
themselves on record as welcoming th*
coming investigation of what the Federal
Government Insists Is a combine in re
straint of trade. Information from Wash
ington is that the firms to be proceeded
against without delay are Armour & Co.,
Nelson Morris & Co., Swift & Co., Cudahy
Packing Company, G. H. Hammond Pack
ing Company and Schwarzschild & Sulz
berger. The strongest evidence that an
unlawful combine exists is said to deal
with what is known as the "big three,"
Armour, Morris and Swift.
Judge W. A- Day arrived here late to
day and immediately conferred with
United States Attorney Sol Bethea re
garding the preparation and filing of a bill
praying for an injunction restraining the
packers from combining. Sufficient evi
dence is said to have been obtained to
convict the packers of having violated the
law as laid down In the anti-trust act.
Attorney Bethea refused to give out any
Information concerning the steps taken
against the beef trust, â¢ Â¦
Regarding the move of the Government
a joint statement was issued late to-day
by the packers stating their position. It
says there Is nothing to eay and nothing
to do until the legal details are taken
up by the Government representatives. It
is no small satisfaction to the packers to
realize now there is to be a fair and im
partial investigation before a recognized
tribunal, and it is bound to develop the
truth and reveal the unfounded character
of the great mass of misstatements that
have gone forth and created popular dis
quietude. The packers welcome the full
est Investigation and will give every aid
to the Federal 'authorities in pursuing
their researches.
The administration, it is , understood,
takes the view that if the beef trust has
really, raised prices arbitrarily and op
pressed the entire nation, of which there
is overwhelming proof, <ne full Justice of
the law ought to be meted out to those'
who are responsible. It is held that the
Sherman anu-trust law, under which these
proceedings will be based, is ample to put
the agents of the beef combination in jail.
The law on the point is very explicit. It
declares every person "guilty of a mis
demeanor who shall be convicted of par
ticipating in any contract or combination
in restraint of trade among the several
States or foreign nations."
It was said to-day that the Department
of Justice has little thought of ending its
campaign against the beef trust with its
efforts to enjoin and dissolve the combi
nation. Stories of criminal prosecutions
that are to follow if a case can be made
are in the air.

The Body Tries to Sweat Them Out.
At a convention of medical men rn 3t.
Louis the effects of coffee drinking were
carefully considered. It was unanimously
agreed that while coffee does not seem to
injure some persons, to others It Is a rank
pcison. The effect on different persona
is, of course, very different. In some the
heart is affected, in others the kidneys,
again the stomach or bowels, or the eyes,
and in nervous cases the prostration is
spread over the whole body.
Ab an illustration, a man in Hinton,
W. Va., experienced well defined symp-
toms of poisoning from coffee. He says:
"I used coffee a great many years with
no apparent ill effects, but about nine
years ago I began being eick. I became
dull, lost my ambition, had dizziness, my
eyesight was very bad and kept getting
worse, and at times I could hardly navi-
gate at all: I felt I was going to fall
every minute, and finally rbecame so bad
I would have to sit down and rest three
or four times in a distance of twice that
many blocks.
"I went from one physician to another
and faithfully took their prescriptions, but
the case was 60 complex that they could
JT.ot successfully diagnose It. I finally
i v.ent to New York City to the Vanderbllt
for treatment. There ray case was
diagnosed as neurasthenia. Every morn-
Ing about nine, I would have a kind of
spaem. The perspiration would break out
all over the palms of my hands, and my
hair would be wringing wet, every nervo
In the body would be affected and my
heart would Jump and beat at a fearful
rate. This condition would generally last
for about two hours. W r hat I suffered no
one can understand.
"It finally came to me that these terri-
ble sweats and spasms were Just the
came as in cases where people are pois-
oned and Nature tries to throw off. the
poison through the pores. So I concluded
that something. I was taking must act
like a poison and I decided it was coffee.
I left it off one morning and had a fear-
ful headache all day, a sure sign that I
was being held up by a drug, so that
evening I bought some Postum and the
rext morning had it for breakfast , In
place of coffee. I was surprised for I
could hardly tell It from coffee. That day
I was only a little sick about the usual
time, and from the next day until now,
eomethlng over thirteen months, I have
never felt even the remotest return of
the Epasros.
f- "I steadily got strong, my weight has
increased from 130 pounds to 147 pounds
and I am a well man. The seven years
of suffering from coffee poison will al-
ways remain with me as a horrible night-
mare." Name given by Postum Co.,' Bat-

LONG OVERDUE â GERMAN SHIP WHICH -IS QUOTED ON THE RE
INSURED LIST AT 60 PER CENT. . SHE IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE'
OCTOBER GRAIN FLEET NOW UNACCOUNTED FOR.
The H street main sewer, now being ex
tended westerly from Fourteenth avenue, and
the proposed section between Tenth and
Seventh avenues, will ultimately serve for
storm waters only. Sewage proper of the Ud
per Sunset District is to be carried in a sepa
rate conduit and delivered across the park into
the mains of Richmond District. This second
sewer will also have an alignment along H
street westerly from Seventh avenue.
H street Is at the south side or the" park.
The sewer for house drainage should be lo
cated on the south side of the street, becaus*
there will be few, if any, connections there
with from the north. The sewer for storm
water should be located either in the center of
the street or to the north thereof.
This storm sewer Is to be used temporarily
to receive house drainage as well as rain water
because the city Is not prepared to carry out
the entire drainage project at this time
Grunsky explains that the sewer is part
of the main drainage system and the lo
cation upon the north side has been pre
ferred f of the reason that a double line
oi car tracks and a central pole line
Â¦would have made the construction oT a
large conduit in a deep trench between
the car tracks less â¢ convenient and more
expensive. The sewer, In that casd,
would have been less accessible, and
would, during construction, have been a
much greater inconvenience to travel
than in the selected location. The report
continues:
The Board of Public Works will submit
to the Board of Supervisors to-day the
report of City Engineer Grunsky as to
Â¦why the proposed Sunset main sewer be
tween Seventh and Tenth avenues has
been deflected from the center line of H
street to the north side thereof.. Com
plaint was made that this would entail
extra expense on property owners for the
construction of side sewers to ' connect
with the south side of the street.

There is no doubt now that Hamilton
is the man who snatched Mrs. Freeman's
purse from her hand on a car at Market
end Powell streets on the night of March
<9. He was chased and captured by
Judge Fritz and threatened the Judge
with a revolver if he did not release him
George Smith and,, Harry Harris, who
were playing cards in the Baldwin Annex
when Hamilton in his flight ran through
there from Ellis to Market street, posi
tively identified him in the City Prison
yesterday, although his mustache had
been shaved off. Both said they had a
good look, at him and could npt be mis
taken. E. K. Jones, an insurance agent
who was on the car with Judge Fritz, is
al Â£! c i rtaln th *t Hamilton is the man
The five prisoners are being kept in sep
arate cells and have not been permitted
to see any attorney or communicate with
tfcejf *Â£Â«"*Â»â¢ It is within the range of
probability that one Trfll confess, which
will help the police greatly in finding the
owners of the stolen property.
Mrs. A. Murray positively identified the
telescope basket and its contents, stolen
from her room at 20S Powe;i street Wed
nesday night, and Mrs. Annie Morrison,
the landlady, has identified Hamilton as
the man she saw in the lodging-house
about 1 ft o'clock Thursday morning.
Sidney Itslop. who lives in the Palmerlee
House, has also identified a dress suit
case found at S35 Howard street as one
belonging to him which had been stolen
from his .room. All the property found
in the house will be open for inspection
at police headquarters to-day, when it is
expected most, if not all of it, will be
identified by the owners.
Additional evidence was secured yes
terday by Policeman H. P. Braig and
Detective Reynolds against Joseph King,
the "preacher convict," Thomas Barker,
Harry Hamilton, alias Day, alias Blair,
Mrs. Annie Barker and her sister, Kittle
Kihill, whom Braig arrested early Thurs
day morning at 835 Howard street.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, April 25.â There, was a peri-
E'stent tendency to-day among the" stocks of
jfraln-carrjing railroads to move. in a see-saw
fashion with the price of grain. The heavy
liquidation and a violent break in prices in
this mornlng*Â» grain markets sent prices of
the grangerE upward with a rush. Union Pa^
ciflc. leading Â¦with an extreme advance of 2%.
The movement spent Its force when It was
6een that good buying had developed in the
grain market at the decline and that prices
were rallying there from the slump caused by
report* of last night's rains. The whole mar
ket felt the lack -of the early aggressive leader,
ship of Union Pacific and during the final
hour there was a ragged recession which wiped
out many early gains and carried prices of
Important stocks among the grangers, coalers.
New York public utilities and high-priced In
dustrials below last night. â¢ There was a late
. advance in the Southern group, marked by very
large buying of Southern Railway at an ex
treme advance of 1%. Louisville aad Nash
ville was lifted at the Bame time 2% and Chi
cago, Indianapolis and Louisville rose 3U over
last night, after erratic fluctuations. This
movement reemed designed to cheek the de
cline elsewhere in the market and when it
was seen . to be without effect the Southern
etock reacted. There was come blddiiig up cf
the grangers again at the close which was
active and steady. There was large buying
of the United States Steel during the- morning
by brokers usually employed by the syndicate.
This buying eeemed to be in connection with
the iesue of the bond-issue circular. The stocks
reacted and became . dull with the r<Â»st of the
market. The circular disclosed that $35,000.
000 of the proceeds of the bond Issue Is de
signed to capitalize expenditures already made
for Improvements and for properties purchased.
The Executive committee estimated that the
expenditure of 125,000,000 for proposed Improve

to the yearly profits. The $50,000,000 proceeds

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been two coal deliveries from Wash

8450; one from Oregon, 680; two from Australia.
3345;- one from Cardiff, Wales, 3093; total, 22
368 tons. The cargo from Cardiff was 300'days
reaching this port, and although the coal is re
puted to be very lgnitable no damage appears
to have been done to the cargo, though nearly
one year making the trip. The quantity at
hand this week is fully equal to the demands
of the market, as a portion of the same will
require to be yarded. " Asking prices remain
unchanged, but buyers for large quantities are
scarce, even at a marked concession in price
The ' Australian list of vessels . to be loaded is

tng of oats and wheat in the Willamette Val
ley, and to a lesser ex^nt in Southern Oregon,
but this work Is now fajrly well advanced, and
with & few warm, dry days 4t will be qulckly
fintehed^ In Eastern Oregon seeding is "prac
tically finished, and farmers are busily en
cagreJ In plowing. The rains have done great
good in the sections of Umatilla County where
the wheat was winter killed, and the reseeded
areas are now locking much better than they
did a couple of weeks ago. Fall wheat has
stooled well and is in a healthy and thrifty
eoDdition lq all sections -of. -the State, except
that its color Is bad In tome poorly drained
localities in the Willamette Valley. In East
ern Oreeon the bulk of " the wheat crop this
year Is fall sown, excluding the Grande Ronde
Valley and about â¢ half of â¢ Umatilla County,
which is spring seeded on summer fallowed
land.
"Good rains have fallen during the past
week in all portions of the' State. Rather more
rain than Is needed has occurred In the west
ern, section, bat in the eastern section it was
welcomed. . t â¢ -- j

CHICAGO, April 25â Rains in .the four,^ big
surplus . wheat'-, and .'corn : States', .played . havoc^
with the priceB of grains on, the Board of Trade;
to-day and caused a ; commotion ? for 1 a. :tlme
that resembled a stampede. : prices
so widely, and wildly; that Â»f or a time '.a. panic
was feared. : - There was i a wild opening ; In . the
wheat pit. Rain had fallen; during 'the Â¦ night
copiously over Iowa, .". Illinois,; Missouri Â¦; and
Nebraska, and 'the situation* was materially re
lieved in Â¦ Kansas, j The. trade ; -hardly S had " to
look at'the weather-map to- know .-that the dry
Weather scare wsis' knocked into a 'cocked- hat.
Strangely enough the heavy downpour in : ; thls
city as. usual gave v'an'-a'dd^d fright ! ttf. wheat
holders, and with one accord there was;- agen
eral wheat-dumping process -at thev sound of the
opening gong.' "> Everybody seemed \o have sell
ing orders. â¢Â¦ So rapid -was the decline* and ; so
Irregular 1 the^ fluctuatl6ns that stop-loss Jorders
were soon met and additional stuff .was thrown
into the. pit, contributing toward ' a- --further,
weakness. Speculators 'in generalâ big/aid lit
tleâfelt the - effect,- of â¢ the -extremely * bearish
weather- conditions,' following -the < slump ,K of
yesterday.;. Of course rains 'were.' expected j for.
a long time, and the traders had' fortified them
selves iwithi stop-loss . selling; orders,"- but there
was such a quantity for sale that the break
became: a" collapse." .Two million -bushels e,ach
were ' unloaded . by " several ' houses. Â« 'Aside ! from
the -.weather news,- conditions might be .^called
bullish. - The . early English' cables were â¢ not
responsive to our slump., of. yesterday, but they
Â»oon â¢ got - into- line and closed weaJc. . .Receipts
were small and statistical papers issued bullish
reports.. â¢ Another support : was .-the.' apparent'
eteadlnesa of 'the Kansas City market; in 'face
of the -break here.,; Some, .traders ( .arjruedi that
market should be in better, position, to know the.
truth "of the Kansas situation .than the '.local
crowd,- Other outside markets .were weak, but
occasional ' reports still complained'-' of - crop
damage. âAfter- the Â¦ early tumult prices recov
ered ' somewhat, but . bearish sentiment induced
further; pressure, and, the market weakened
again. ; -May wheat â¢ opened â¢ %@%c -to- 1%-to
l%c lower, with- sales as - wide â¢ as' 74%o~to
73?4c July sold at the start between 76@75%c.
The close was . weak",' "May lU@tU"C, lower' at
74Hc and July l%c off At 75%@75%c. " â¢ s 
. Corn.. suffered even a worse. break. than
at the opening-, slumping as much as 2%C-
Wheat sympathy, and the. general rains were'
the factors. All day the pit was a scene- of
much excitement and nervous feeling. Â¦ .Corn
was Â¦ dumped freely into - the pit regardless of
prices. Stop-loss orders came out all the way
down and. during the early scramble there was
practically no' support. ' Even the' " big ; bull
crowd' Bold out much of their holdings for
profit. "Tailers" were badly squeezed. After
the general selling movement had seemingly
knocked . the , bottom put -of. Â¦ the market ! there
was -some responsive buying and prices re
covered ljÂ£c from the lower point of the day.
Subsequently much of this recovery was lost,
as scalpers sold again. "Â¦ The close. was weak,
both July and May closing lc lower at 63
and 62%c respectively. ; a -..
Oats declined with the break in other grains,
but the market ruled comparatively quiet. The
close was weak. May lc lower at 42'/4c
Provisions maintained a' firm undertone the
greater part of the .session in spite of the
weakening . influence of grains. Prices, how
ever, slid off In the face of a light run, of hogs
and the . highest prices of the year at the yards.
Bears t made some use * of ; the contemplated
prosecution of the meat trust to depress prices,
but packers supported the market . at the de
cline. â¢ .There was a good demand for products,

Upon being asked what conversation he
had i with Laymance . in regard to
the oil lands dispute. Donohue de
clined to answer the question. Â¦ Judge
Hall then declared him guilty of
contempt and sentenced, him to remain in
the County Jail until the decision of the
Supreme Court is filed. , Donohue' s attor
neys had papers already prepared to get
their client out of Jail on habeas corpus.
These they . presented to -* the Supreme
Court and a writ was immediately issued:
The court Is expected to render a decision
in a day or two. Â¦ â¢"-.. Â¦ / '..".â¢ .
The, proceeding was in accordance with
an agreement between the cour,t and at
torneys representing the litigants. Judge
Hall recently decided : that when sitting
as a referee in a deposition taking he had
the power to enforce any of his mandates
by punishment forL contempt. It. was
agreed that Mr. Donohue, whose deposi
tion was sought, should appear in court
and decline to answer . questions In order
to give his attorneys an opportunity to
get a. Supreme Court- decision. .

teen Sailors.
VALLEJO, April 25.-SIxteen United
States sailors, after serving four months
in San Quentin for mutiny, were returned
to Mare Island to-day for their pay and
discharge from the service. Their offense
was a refusal to clean out the bilges ot
an extremely dirty former Spanish gun
boati-tho Manila. The men nad -worked
on the task until dinner time, when they
were ordered to dinner. . On arriving: at
table the order was countermanded and
they, were sent back to conclude their vile
task before eating. They refused to obey.
The provocation was great, but that did
not lessen the crime of insubordination.
They were court-martialed and sentenced
to from two to ten years each. They
were sent to San Quentin Prison. There
they have worked out ' four months of
their time. Upon a rehearing: and inves
tigation they were ordered released and
yesterday the tender waa sent to bring
them here to receive their discharges.

It U my earnest hope that " our order may
render effective Â«ervice in tHis matter. For
years I have advocated the use of home prod
ucts and the upbuilding- of our State's inter
est. I want to see the label "made in Cali
fornia" .crowd out all brands- of manufacture
that enter in competition -*wlth ; what our
Golden State can produce. Why, for Instance,
should we Californlana buy orange marmalade
made in ..Scotland, .where never an orange
grows, Â¦ in preference to the home product?
The sug-eestlon that the Native Sons' parlors
select 'some industry of Its own locality and
by consultation with those directly Interested
proceed to devise means Â¦ whereby the . parlor
might aid j in . its development applies equally
well to the Native Daughter*' parlors.
I would suggest that the Merchants' " and
Producers' Association have display envelopes
printed for such localities as can be thus ex
ploited and that '. the cost be placed at sta
tioner's usual price, and that the Native Sons
and the Native Daughters use them and do so
liberally in' their correspondence. For ' fiestas
and boom occasions the aid Â¦ of illuminated
stationery is Included. Why not use it for the
purpose of steadily booming the State? Let
them prepare the envelopes Â¦ and postal . cards
and I can answer for the Native Daughters.
They will use them. , â¢
Referring to the fact that Mr. Sbarboro,
president of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, has appealed to the
Native Sons of the Golden West for their
support in developing the resources of the
State. Grand Vice President Eliza Doug
las Keith of the Native Daughters of the
Golden West said. yesterday:
The executive committee of. the pro
motion committee of the State Board of
Trade, of which A.' Sbarboro is chairman,
is anxious to complete the work of rais
ing funds in order that its plans for the
promotion of immigration may begin to
take definite shape early. A list of sub
scribers will probably be published about

mittee desires'that merchants and others

Teams Are Ready

The proprietors of the projected busi
ness are well known to the commercial
world and success for the enterprise
seems positively, assured. Those inter
ested in the growth and welfare of San
Francisco will welcome the establishment
of so important an enterprise in the city.
That San Francisco merchants are alive
to the growing importance of this city a*
a commercial center has of late been
many times shown, but probably no re
cent event in business circles has created
more Interest than the announcement that
the premises formerly occupied by J. J.
O'Brien & Co., corner of Jones and Mar
ket streets, have been leased and will be
remodeled for the accommodation of a
modern general department store. The
firm will consist of A. J. Praeger & Sons;
a. corporation of this city and Portland,
and Henry Goldwater, formerly largely
interested in Prescott and Phoenix, Ariz.
Mr. Praeger, who is at the head of af
fairs at the "Red Front," so well known
to frequenters of Market street, states
that the new store ! will be conducted as
a popular priced and thoroughly modern
general department store, where the best
values and the lowest prices will always
be associated. The store will be opened
about September 1, after being entirely
remodeled and equipped for the purpose
of handling the trade to. the bes"t advan
tage. Only the most competent and best
help will be employed, and the prevailing
idea will be to cater to the women In
much the same manner that the Red
Front does now and will continue to do
to the men.

RIVAL STUDENTS'
ANNUAL DEBATE
School Director Denman appeared be
fore the committee and reported progress
in regard to the plans which are being ar
ranged for the construction of the new
Bchoolhouses under the bond Issue He
eald that the sites for the new schools
had all been selected and promised to eub
. tnlt a report regarding them at the next
meeting, when provisions will be made
for having them appraised.
The Spring- Valley Water Company sent
a. communication to the board to the ef
fect that it was willing- to gTant the city
the right of way over its Lobos Creek
property to order that the park might be
connected with the Presidio. The com
pany requested, however, that the Super
visors stipulate exactly over what portion
of Its property the city desires the right
of way.
The Supervisors believe that this provi
sion of the charter is not valid and the
opinion of the City Attorney has been
asked. Should the City Attorney decide
that the charter is correct on this point
the Supervisors desire to have matters
so arranged that the plans for the acquisi
tion of the road will not be disarranged,
so the City Engineer was requested to
prepare estimates of the cost of construct
ing the road over the route. The route
suggested extends up Grant avenue to
Bush street, thence to Kearny and up
Kearny to Pine and thence to the ferry.
This route will relieve the necessity of the
city's cars running for more than five
blocks on any street occupied by the
tracks of another company.
According to the plans laid down by the
committee yesterday, the Geary-street
road, when acquired by the city and
changed into a conduit electric
system, will commence at Fulton
etreet on Tenth avenue and ex
tend along Tenth avenue to Point
Lobos avenue and thence to Geary street.
The charter provides that in the acquisi
tion of public utilities by the city, bids
shall be asked for and in order to com
ply with this stipulation the clerk of the
committee was requested to ask the
United Railroads Company to submit of
fers for the sale of a portion or the whole
of its roads. It is expected that at the
meeting of the committee next Thursday
the City Engineer will be ready to report
the estimated cost of the Geary-street
road, together with the cost of extending
It to the ferry over both routes.
rang-e merits for the acquisition of the
Geary Street Railway at the expiration
of the franchise of the present company.
In order that the provisions of the char
ter might be complied with in full, the
committee requested that the City Engi
neer furnish estimates for the cost of con
structing two roads. /
The charter provides that the cars of
one company shall not be allowed to run
for more than five blocks on a street oc
cupied by the tracks of another company.
As it is the desire of the Supervisors to
extend the Geary-street road down to the
ferry and as Market street already con
tains the roadbeds of the United Rail
roads and as it is more than five blocks
from, the termination of Geary street to
the ferry, it would appear that the city
would be unable to have their cars run
along Market street down to the ferry.
The Public -Utilities Committee of the
Board of Supervisors devoted its cession
yesterday afternoon to completing ar-
The petition of the Harbor Commission
that Bender Brothers be exempted from
the provisions of a resolution ordering the
removal of obstructions at the foot of
Third street was denied.
The Judiciary Committee postponed ac
tion until next Friday on Supervisor Mc-
Clellan's proposed resolution providing
that all franchises granted in the future
shall contain a clause prohibiting dis
crimination against union labor. Chair
man Comte ruled that it would not be
wise for the committee to make any rec
ommendation while negotiations are
pending for the settlement of the strike.
The Joint committee on Judiciary and
Streets recommended a resolution yester
day authorizing I. W. Hellman to return
to the Sutro heirs a deed held by him in
escrow conveying a right of way to the
city for the widening of Dewey boule
vard. The committee approved the City
Attorney's opinion that the agreement
entered into by the city with the late
Adolph Sutro to! complete the work of
constructing the boulevard within a cer
tain prescribed time had not been com
plied with.
In charging the jury Judge de â¢ Haven
said there .had been no evidence to Justify
the conviction of the defendant on the
second and third counts of the indictment
which charge embezzlement. The evi
dence did not show that: the money had
ever been instrusted to the defendant in
his official custody, so the jury should
confine itself to the 'consideration , of the
charge In the first .countâ that of larceny.
The jury was also instructed that ' the
good character of the accused was a fac
tor in the case and a circumstance tendln?
in a greater or lesser degree to establish
his .innocence. The jury ; was also in
structed to accept with caution testimony
as to verbal admissions- alleged to have
been made \by the defendant and also
testimony given by the detectives. The
jury also, in considering Dimmlck's own
testimony, had a right to take into con
sideration his great, personal interest in
the case. It was Immaterial whether 'or
not the affairs of the Mint were conducted
with carelessness If the. jury should find
that the offense 'had been committed bv
the accused. â¢ . . t , ., , f
The Jury retired at 2:20 p. m. ': 'â¢'â¢â¢Â¦.:
CHARGE TO THE JTTRY.
-The dress suit case episode was taken
up next. Denson said he believed that
Mrs. Dimmick had told the â¢ truth when
she testified j that she had â¢ never- seen her
husband in ' possession of a- dress suit
case. She was a noble woman, standing
by her husband as a soldier stands to his
guns. "No man contemplating a crime,"
continued he, "will tell his honest wife
what he is doing. He would , be afraid
that her conscience might force her: to
betray the guilty secret, and Dimmlck
was too shrewd and too deep to; take His
wife into his confidence in this matter.
Taken by surprise when he was asked In
the investigation in the Mint to explain
that episode, Dimmlck denied that 'he had
ever been In possession of. one. Having
made that denial formally and. his words
having been taken down, he -was obliged
during the trial to stick- to the" story he
had told at first." Â¦ \ ; " â¢
Counsel then explained why Watchman
Bills had not reported to Superintendent
Leach the fact that he had seen Dim
mlck at midnight with two sacks of coin
In his hands by saying that -Ellis did not
suspect that anything was wrong. Even
had he so suspected he had no witness to
corroborate him, and Chief Clerk Dim
mick could put his thumb upon him and
crush him. , ..... ..
The counsel next called, the attention
of the jury to the significant fact that
Dimmick had Instructed Cole not to . re
move the â¢ trucks from in front . of * the
pigeonholes from which had been re
moved the six sacks containing the $30,000.
On the charge made by Collins in his
argument that a . conspiracy existed
against Dimmlck to prove him the man
guilty of stealing the money lor the pur
pose of relieving Superintendent Leacn of
the responsibility xor the loss, Denson
said that Leach was responsible on his
bonds for the whole of the *M,W0, no mat
ter who stole it, and he could nojt there
fore have had any pecuniary, interest In
convicting the accused. Blmmick was ac
cused of the crime because he, was the
oniy man that could have committed' It
under the circumstances disclosed, by the
evidence. "These circumstances are small
in themselves," said Denson, "but. taken
in their entirety no other conclusion la
probable or reasonable but that of Dim
mlck's guilt. If was bad enough for Dim
mick to have stolen the money, without
having attempted to take advantage of
this ignorant and inexperienced druggist
from Martinez, Cole, and deliberately: to
scheme to place him in the 'penitentiary.
Oh for a lash In every honest band Â¦ Â¦ â¢ â¢
To'whtp the rascal naked through the land.
DENSON SCORES DIMMICK.
The fate of Walter N. Dimmlck, who Is
accused of stealing $30,000 from the. Mint,
is now in the hands of the jury. The
case was submitted to the jurors yester
day afternoon, and as they had been un
able to agree upon a verdict up to 9
o'clock last night, Judge de Haven or
dered them locked up for the night.;.
S. C. Denson of the firm of Denson. &
Schlesinger, special counsel for the Gov
ernment, began his argument at 10 o| clock
in. the morning. The counsel's manner
was impressive. The sophisms of Attor
ney Collins were laid bare as with, the
surgeon's knife/ and the conclusions ,to
which his conspiracy theory would lead
were illustrated in a most convincing
manner. Â¦ ,,
"It was by the merest accident, con
tinued Uenson, "that Uimmlck . was
caught coming out ol the receiver's room
witn two sucks oÂ£ gold coin in his hands
