Kingstown is fifteen miles from

From Chateau Belaire word
came that the distress there was
great. A call had been sent for
a clergyman, and one was taken
up by the Wear. Down the sides
of La Soufriere were floating
hundreds of streams of lava
which uniting and separating
formed a network from which
there was no possible escape for
any living thing caught within
its grasp. Already one thousand
bodies have been recovered, and
it is known that many hundreds
lie buried under ' the ashes that
are mantled over the island.
FUXFIIXS PROPHECY. Â¦>
It is conservatively estimated
that two thousand have been.sac
rificed since the first eruption on
May 7. This includes all of the
Carib Indians, which means the
practical extinction of the race
that was found here "by Columbus
four centuries ago.
An old Indian prophecy that
the Caribs would be sacrificed to
the Fire God which they wor
shiped has thus been fulfilled. Of
the Caribs only a few individuals
remain on the islands of St. Lucia
and Dominica.
The British steamer Cermet on
Sunday ran^ through five miles of
smoke that was so dense that the
crew was almost suffocated. For
more than an hour the ship had
to be left to its own guidance.

When Kingstown was finally
reached at daybreak it was found
panic stricken. The streets were
covered two inches deep with
ashes and stones that had fallen
during the night.
La Soufriere has been in activ
ity for nine days, and its victims
are numbered by the thousands.
A line drawn from Chateau Be

of the fleeing inhabitants.
This lasted through the night,
and the day and night following.
On Thursday morning a huge
column so black that it had the
appearance of ebony rose to an
estimated height of eight miles
front the top of the volcano. The
atmosphere was so laden with
sulphurous gas that life was made
almost impossible.
SUFFOCATED BY GAS.
It is believed that many of
those nearest to Soufriere were
suffocated by this gas before they
were touched by the burning
lava. Many .expected that the
entire'island would be destroyed
and the night of Thursday was
given up to prayers. All that
night the darkness was beyond
description save when everything
was made iight as broad day .by
the lightning which forked out
from the volcano. The eapth
quaked incessantly, the moun
tains shook, stones, lava and
great quantities of ashes never
ceased to fall. So terrible were
the thunders that it seemed to
the terrified that the universe was
being rent in pieces.
MUCH RUIN WROUGHT.
Friday brought a slight res*
pite. Soufriere became less agi*
tatecfc The lava streams did not
decrease, but the showers of
rocks stopped for a time. Then
those of stout heart ventured out
to take stock of the wonderful
ruin that had been wrought. All
areas of cultivation were found to
be destroyed, buried underbanka
of volcanic matter. Walabou
and Richmond plantations and
villages on the leeward coast
were wrecked. Walibou was
partly under water which had
been swept in from the sea by a
tidal wave. Five other planta
tions were gone.

some places lava had rolled over

of St. Lucia. In the Spanish: islands the
aborigines were all killed off. but tho
British fostered the. remnant on St. Vin

village. There were only a few dozen of
them. So this 'Volcanic upheaval has

ZTEGHO PBISONEB ! SAFE.
In all St. Pierre only a single human
being escaped the work of Mont Pelee
The- one is a negro murderer, who was
locked in a cell so far underground that
the gases, as well as the flames, failed to
reach him. There he remained for four
cays before his cries were heard. When
the cell door was thrown open he dashed
away toward the distant woods. Me is
fcelitved to have been crazed by the awful
experience through which he passed.
Anrned soldiers are now watching the
workers to prevent the robbing of the
dead bodies or the ruins. Vandals con
tinue to profit, but orders that have been
given to shoot down any person who is
seen robbing a body will put a stop to the
crime. . . .
Many of the bodies are carbonize* and
swollen. Some are encrusted with ashes.
Under one ruin perhaps only a single
bedy will be found, while not far oft will
be a group of a half-score huddled togath
erd. Searchers often while walking
through the ashes step upon what ap
pfcars to be a charred pillar of stone, only
to learn as it yields grewsomely under
foot that it is the trunk of another unfor
tunate. . . .
In the streets the ashes, and cinders
are in places six feet deep. Everywhere,
are the dead bodies, decomposing and
giving eff a stench that makes the work
ers faint. Although thousands have been
burned, bodies still remain to be cre
mated.
The dead are being burned, the pyres
fcelTi^T fed with petroleum and tar. Great
fires are kept going, which at night light
up the entire island, and which, being
seen at St. Lucia, led to the belief that
Fort de France had been burned. It is
impossible to give an adequate descrip
tion of the conditions existing in St.
Pierre. The fires in the city have burned
themselves out. making it possible to d!g
tlowri into the ruins, thus revealing the
horrors that have been buried.

is being continued in an unsatisfactory
manner. The soldiers ' have to be. forced
to act, and hour by hour the danger of

"While in neither case is there recorded
any great disaster approaching in seri
ousness that of Martinique and of St. Vin
cent, it will still be seen from the record
that the dangers in Panama are greater
vthan in Nicaragua, and in view of the
recent calamities in the "West Indies and
the great public interest aroused these
considerations will have great weight
when the canal bill comes to a decision.
The commission's report found that the
entire isthmus was a volcanic region, and
in general terms the region of volcanoes
te a region- of earthquakes. The records
for points along the proposed Nicaragua
canal show fourteen earthquakes during
the period. from the time" of the Spanish
conquest up , to 1886. The record for the
Panama canal for that time shows
tvrertty-elght earthquakes, of which
twelve took place in three yearsâ 1882, 18S3
and 18S4â which illustrates the' incom
pleteness of the record so far as Panama
is concerned. Since 1886 there have been
no earthquakes of any importance along
either route. The only disturbance to
cause serious injury in Nicaragua was
that of 1S84, when the towns of Rlvas and
Grey town' received considerable damage
There were two earthquakes in Panama
classed aa destructiveâ one in 1861, when
the town, of Panama was almost de
stroyed, and another in 1882, which is still
well remembered.
"One has only to consider briefly the
facts of this story,", said Morgan, "to
become convinced that so far as earth
quake disturbances are concerned the
Nicaragua route is altogether the best.
The Isthmian Canal Commission went
ii:to the question very thoroughly and has
made up a -record of earthquakes, by the
Panama and Nicaragua lines which goes
to show that there 'has been twice as
many earthquake disturbances along the
Panama line as along Nicaragua. This
fact speaks for itself."
est in the discussion of the connec
tion between earthquakes, volcanic erup
tions and canal routes, and takes the
ground that the record of disturbances in
the isthmus is altogether in favor of the
Nicaragua route.

The human heart, that most wonderful -

fist. Yet in each twentv-four hours the
dual heart moves approximately six tons
of blood, equivalent to about two barrels
of blood per hour. And this continues
without ceasing, from the first breath of
infancy to the last sigh of age. Is it any
wonder that when continued extra strain
is put upon so delicate and busy an or-
gan, it should break down? Is it any
wonder that in this age of overwork
there should be an increasing number of
deaths attributed to heart failure ? ";.

MOKELUMNE HILL", May 14.â A beau
tiful cave has been discovered in running
a tunnel In the Iowa Consolidated mine
at Rich Gulch. A description of the cav
ern .was' brought to Mokelumne Hill to
day by ' Ami Laidet. the .foreman of the
mine. The. cave Is nearly 200 feet under
ground, and almost 250 feet from the
mouth of the tunnel. No signs of this
cavern. appeared as the work progressed
in the tunnel until Saturday morning,
when the miners found "that the last
round of- blasts touched 'oft the evening
before had -blown out all the face of the
tunnel, making a clear .opening into the
cave. I At least ten miner's inches of the
clearest water was flowing out of the
rough tunnel. There seems to be a'sub
terrancan leak in the cave, as every at
tempt to reach bottom by sounding has
thus far proved futile. . : ;
The cave is in limestone as far. as ex
plored. -It' is about thirty feet long, nine
feet wide and four feet high. The walls
are covered by highly sulphureted stalac

Before Mrs. Barnes had finished telling
of their joint theatrical venture in Amer
ica, its failure and their separation, tho
court adjourned. She will resume her tes
timony to-morrow.
Mrs. Barnes began her testimony by
stating that she was 36 years of age and
the former wife of W. S. Barnes of San
Francisco. She then told how she went
to Europe with her "pickaninny band,"
exhibiting in England. Ireland and France.
While in Paris in 189-5 he was obliged to
have several contracts translated and
sought out the American consulate, where
she met 'the young Vice Consul, Clyde
Schropshire. Immediately a friendship
developed. She said they attended horse
races, fancy balls, champagne suppers and
other events. She declared that he had
given her a ring and promised to marry
her.
Mrs. Barnes was denounced by the at
torneys for the defense as an adventuress,
but she merely smiled at the Jury and
the twelve men took her side. When the
action to recover on the notes had been
disposed of the breach of promise suit for
$50,000 damages was taken up. Mrs. Barnes
was the first witness and she gave a vivid
description of the gay life she led in Paris
with Schropshire; of their romance, of
the shifting from glittering pleasures to
dark disappointments, financial difficulties
and separation.

he had been on the San Francisco Exam

the San Francisco police.
A short time after the prisoner had
pone Detective Bryant, who had been im
pressed with the fact that he had seen
"Hatton's" face somewhere before, got
out the circular of the San Francisco po
lice and discovered that, the description
given in it coincided in a remarkablei de
gree with the general characteristics of
the man that had been released. Within
a few minutes after that the search for
the missing man began. I
The man whom it is now thought was
Hadley was arrested by Policeman Larra
bee near the County Courthouse Tuesday
forenoon. The prisoner, gave the name of
Hutchinson and begged .the officer, not to
take him to the police station. He said
that he was a: member of a theatrical
troupe now playing here and he did not
want to be locked up. Members of the
troupe have since said that no man an
swering the description of the prisoner
belongs to the troupe.
Hutchinson was simply locked up for
safekeeping, and as soon as he was sober
he was released.. .Late. Tuesday night he
was arrested again, this time by Pollce

He was released yesterday morning.
Â¦A man whom the police now believe was
Hadley was twice arrested here . Tuesday
for drunkenness and was released both

Special Dispatch,- to The Call.
There were numerous rumors about the
hall regarding the future policy of tho
organization. The . most persistent one
and one that was indorsed by several
leaders was that there would be no actual
leader 'of Tammany Hall for some time
to come. This was coupled with a rumor
that the finance committee would be abol
ished, as well as the chairmanship' of this
committee.' The chairman, who is now
I.ewis Nixon and was . Richard Croker.
has always been the leader of Tammany
Kail, and as such had the handling of the
funds of the organization in the political
campaigns.
Following the departure of Nixon sev
eral of the leaders remained for some
time in groups, chatting about the resig
nation and the possible developments. It
was announced that a meeting of the ex
ecutive committee of district leaders will
be held Thursday, at which time Nixon's
action will be acted upon.
He immediately left the room, followed
by an outburst of handclapping. â¢ Once
cutside the meeting room Nixon would
only say to the newspaper men: ;
â¢ "I am out as leader of Tammany Hall.
Shipbuilding is my business. 1 am out of
politics and am glad of It. I will devote
rhy ; time to my business of .shipbuilding
and will talk of that by the hour, but I
will not talk about politics hereafter. The
cause of my resignation is plain. I could
have won out and elected Feitner grand
sachem, 'but I would not appeal to
Cioker." , .'
There was a moment's silence when
Nixon had finished. Then Michael C.
Murphy made a very complimentary
speech in praise of Nixon. He did not
Â£,ay, however, that he wished him to re
main as leader. He said that Nixon had
done splendid work as the leader and had
the confidence of all the leaders. Nixon
Jumped to his feet as soon as Colonel
Murphy had finished and said:
"1 do not desire any vote' of confidence
v.-hatever."
The meeting of the district leaders was
called at the instance of iNixon, who on
Tuesday night sent telegraphic messages
to all of the thirty-seven. This action
followed a deadlock at the. meeting of tne_
sachems of the Tammany Hall Society
Monday, when Nixon's intention of re
taining Thomas L. Feltner as grand sa
chem was frustrated by a tie, there be
ing six of the sachems of .the thirteen for
and six against the retention, the thir
teenth, George C. Clausen, being absent.
The action at that time caused a gen
eral discussion of the possibilities, of
Nixon losing control of the organization
and the combination neaded by John F.
Carroll ousting him. Nixon, in an inter
view on Tuesday, "said' if he could not
have the confidence of the leaders he
would eet out. â â
When Nixon arrived at Tammany Hall
to-day all thirty-seven leaders were pres
ent. As soon as the meeting was called
Nixon arose and said:
"Gentlemen, 1 have decided to resign
as leader of Tammany Hall. This resig
nation Is absolute and positive, and will
not be withdrawn. I wish it to take effect
immediately. I feel that I cannot retain
my self-respect anc! still remain the
leader of Tammany Hall. My -decision is
unalterable.';/
Â¦^ NEW YORK, May 14.â Lewis Nixon,
leader of Tammany '. Hall for nearly six
months, resigned that position to-day at
a meeting of the district readers, heldjn
Tammany Hall.. While the resignation
was not entirely unexpected, it was not
thought that Nixon would take such pos
itive action until a later date, first wait
ing the action of the leaders to see if
they "would give him a ..vote of confi
dence. Instead of .this he refused to al
low any vott of confidence, and went so.
far as to say* that he could .no longer re
tain -his s self-respect if he remained as
leader." , , â¢

DR. KILMER & CO., Blnghamton, N. Y.
Â¦ Gentlemenâ While it has never been my habit or Inclination to recommena
remedies the ingredients of which are not all known to me, it seems aa it I
should make an exception in the case of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root. My experi-
ence, so far as I have tested it in my practice, forces me to the conclusion that It
is a remedy of the greatest value in all kidney, Uver, bladder and other inflamma-
- tory conditions of the genito-urinary tract. I now take pleasure in prescribing
Swamp-Root in all such cases, with a feeling of assurance that my patients will
. derive great benefit from its use. I shall continue to prescribe It In other cases In
my practice with the expectation of good results. Very truly yours.
Gentlemenâ I have prescribed that wonderful rerSedy for kidney complaint. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, with most beneficial effect and know of many cures by It3
use. These patients had kidney trouble, as diagnosed by other physicians, and
treated without benefit. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root effected a cure. I am a liberal
man and accept a specific wherever I find it, in an accepted school or out of it.
For desperate cases of kidney complaint under treatment with unsatisfactory re-
sults I turn to Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root^ with most flattering results. I 'hall
continue to prescribe it. and from pÂ«rsoral observations state that Swamp-Root
has great curative properties. Truly Yours,

Rev. P. S. . Brush of Alameda offered
similar testimony.
Montgomerys Testify in Way CaSC,
The. university can only be democratic while
it keeps In touch with the world about it.
And so, far more than any formal instruction,
do various activities about the State univer
sities keep them true to their mission. De
bating, which keeps college; students In touch
with the nation's problems; Journalism, which
keeps them In touch with Its activities, and
the, work cf college settlements, ! which keeps
them in touch-with that phase of- human- life
that university students ' above - all are prone
to ignore â all these and many more help our
State universities to fulfill their. mission. For
the ordinary student will : like an essentially
student > life unless he is forced out ' of . it.
He prefers to talk to his fellow students rather
than to outsiders; Â¦ to be always â¢ near college
ratheV than to live at some little distance from
it; to dlscusa college news rather - than â¢ the
news of the world, and all this Is excused in
his eyes by the phrase "college loyalty."
But there is yet. another element "the in
innuence of which on.. 1 student life. In this
respect ftas been Ignored, and that Is our
intercollegiate athletic . contests.. v These . strug
gles are constantly growing more and more im
portant in the eyes of the students. It is" true
that. they inculcate democratic ways of think
ing, so far as students are concerned In their
relations with one another, for . it was soon
discovered that a college . which made social
position the basis , for ..selection" on football
teams would hardly ever have the. good for
tune . to gain the , prize. â¢â¢ So that as : these con-
Our State universities as institutions arc
framed on the most' democratic lines. But
this is of but slight Importance compared with
the other Question, whether their Influence la
such an to make their - students democratic.
Jusf in so far as students are withdrawn- from
the life of the . world about them are they
prone to undemocratic ways of thinking, not in
regard to one another.- but in regard to. the
rest of the world. The more decidedly cut off
they are. from the world the more will they
regard themselves as Â¦ a separate class, - and
from their creater educational opportunities ' a
sur>erior class. â¢. ' Â¦
That our nation exists to serve as an ex
periment In self-government is never seriously
disputed, nor, on the other hand, seriously be
lieved. -But it is nevertheless indisputable that
a nation's succes3 lies not in its. material
liroKres3 or its -place in the so-called concert
of nations, but In ' its success in securing the
realization of Its ideals. It is for that a na
tion, lives.- Therefore, however great the temp
tation, i.ur national life must be essentially
democratic or else it is an utter failure. The
great problem then In our Stale, in fact, the
only problem, is the making actual and real
the demccratic^ideal. . â¢Â¦ .
And this ideal is all summed up. It. seems to
me, in two expressions â equality of opportunity
and the recognition of individual worth. . It is
aimed to give all an equal opportunity to make
the most of their lives, so far as can be done
in the case of any one life. And then, having*
made the starting: point the same for all, it
seeks to bring It about that the "race is tc
the swift," in short, that Judgment be made
on the basis of the man's worth â on what Is he,
not. what is his, whether that be an ancestry
Â¦or a country house.
'The means universally employed to attain
the idea! a nation has set up for itself is edu
cation. For it Is in the formative period in
the lives of each successive jreneration that
these ideals can be impressed upon them. Their
lives can then be so molded that whatever
makes for equality of opportunity and the
recognition of the individual will eeem neces
sarily the right courses of action. â¢ Every na
tion has thus sought to make 'real its ideal.
And our State educational institutions from
the primary school to the university are but
expressions of our faith in the power of educa
tion to make each , generation more essentially
American in the best sens*.
'Monroe E. Deutsch^ the next speaker,
had selected for his address "The State
University as a Democratic Institution."
He spoke in part as follows:

Police and Fire Commissioners to-day,

drawn in favor of Mrs. Mary Ennis,
widow of the late W. C. Ennls, a fireman,
who died while fighting 1 fire last August,
and to the widow of the late Henry Ned

DEMOCRACY OF
A UNIVERSITY
its sure foundations, the ideal opens above It
an outlook, a heaven, a hope.
Children of many hopes, children of high
opportunity, go forth and serve.
To criticize doctor and saee may seem pre
sumptuous in one but. on the threshold of
education, I but : I believe modern . educational
tendencies are in grave danger of turning in
the * wrons direction. I believe the constant
emphasis laid . upon the money value of every
thing, from >readstuffs to food for gunpowder
Is even now felt within the sacred walls -of the
university, that should be the citadel Â» of mor
ality. Inspiring its graduates to higher living
fitting them to become leaders and helpers of
their fellows, ' not taskmasters and oppressors.
The real- purpose of an institution of learning
is to help men to realize that the right answer
to the ethical question what ought I to do is
in- terms of self -sacrifice and duty,, not dollars
'tnd cents.
It is of great value in making a man master
of his environment, but it should not aim to
constitute him master of his fellows, unless
It at the same time feaches him- what such
mastery entails. He who advocates technical
or - professional training that does not rest
upon a, foundation of real education â that is.
education that shall make Its possessor fully
aware of the duty, he owes to other men â is
an unconscious enemy to civilization, because
he subordinates the ultimate welfare of society
and the individual as well to the lower interest
of the individual.
He must act In accordance with his con
science, seeking Hsht from whatever source
possible. From the very nature of humanity
the former difficulty is easy of solution. When
a man is behind his generation, his inborn de
sire to adapt himself to society and be in
harmony with his companions will draw him
toward their, standard. His natural inclination
will bring him to the light. In the latter,
however, the very opposite Is the case. The
man ahead of his generation, will find himself
sorely tempted to make. the prevailing standard
of -worth his own. . If his desire tor rational
self-^realUatlon will not permit him to sur
render himself, we have our moral hero, out
Socrates, our Christ â men finding their reward
not in the plaudits of the multitude, but In an
approving conscience. ' : . Â¦ ,.
The knowledge gained by study is valuable,
only to the extent that it helps the individual
to find his place in the world â to determine
his relations to other individuals and how much
his own private judgment Is to be Influenced
by theirs. He is still an individual and must
think for himself, decide for himself, act for
himself. If his thought, his decisions, hi3
acts are such as accord with the prevailing
tendencies of men around. him, then he meets
their approval and- eets along in the world;
if they are such as do not accord with current
public opinion, either because he is purely selC
centered, or cannot conscientiously subscribe
to prevailing beliefs, then he becomes In a
measure antagonistic to his fellows.
To each Individual comes a question bearing
with It the imperative demand for answer â
the question what ought I to do? And every
individual does answer it in one way or an
other, and in so doing he commits himself to
a; course of conduct destined to prove his sal
vation or his undoing.

EDUCATION
HIS SUBJECT
Thoughtful men are saying that our flour
ishing modern drama is without moral or lit
erary value; that the original comedies pro
duced in English to-day deal not with the fact*
or problems or emotions of life, but with trivial
sensations and"""a make-believe world. Stage
managers in turn complain that there is little
use in appealing to the intelligence of the pub
lic â that- an audience wants to laugh. to~cry,
to shudder, but -not to think. However there
still are left a few true playwrights â Stephen
Phillips, for instance, is trying to make dra
matic poems succeed beside the latest frivolity
from giddy Paree. Plnero and Jones, however
morbid and unwholesome are many of their
themes, at all events are producing plays
which are not only actable, but are also read
able. Now If students are bent on stagin
contemporary drama why not produce Such
plays as give an effective picture of some real
aspect of life â if only to vary a farcical and
extra vaganzlcal monotony? Farces are all very
well In their, wayâ provided they are simply
fantastic, not puerile and vulgar. But a uni
versity, by its very nature, should concern it
self with that which has an undercurrent of
seriousness. And if university students will
produce plays and so connect themselves with
the dramatic movement of the day thev shnnM
not fall in line with the dramatic decadence of
the day. The burlesque, the bisque songs the
too gay Thanksgiving showâ leave all those to
the commercial manager. They are nnt ?Â»,Â»
field of the university 8 The* latter should 'Jn
the one hand endeavor to. keep alive what H*
best in thfl ; drama of the past and should en
courage what is truly representative of tSÂ«
present. Arid If both faculty and student
support such college theatricals the unlveVsHy
may assist in the formation of public taste and
in the production of a future EnirlUh rtUâ¢
which shall be worthy ot the Fast ForTe*
mand creates -supply, not more on 'Change
than behind the footlights. v.nange
In America, while university faculties hjtve
given but slight assistance to university the
atricals, the students, left to themselves, have
kept up the custom in their own sweet way.
Where in the old days they gave a Senecan
tragedy, now too often they give opera bouffe,
with a splash of college color. I am not ask
ing that this state of things should be reme
died by an appropriation of money for the
sake of promoting the drama in this university.
On that side of the subject I have nothing to
say. Nor does any one desire that Greek and
Latin classics only should appear on the col
lege stage or that these should be given often.
But there is many a fine old play which forms
a part of the literature of our own language,
and which has sunk into undeserved oblivion.
Even Shakespeare is known far top little â a
modern presentation of "Romeo and Juliet" or
"The Tempest" gives more attention to the
splendor of the stage setting than to the play
Itself. Now It Is against this tendency on the
modern stage â the frame rather than the pic
tureâthat the university should direct Its in
fluence, in so far as It concerns itself with
theatricals at all. The presentation of a good
play at college need not require a costly dis
play of scenery, but rather intelligent deliv
ery and harmonious setting.
Now the university is, and has been for cen
turies, the natural home of the drama. As
far back as the flf teenth century the boys In.
the German colleges were giving Latin come
dies. During the heat and storm of the Refor
mation the Jesuits wrote plays for their semi
naries and Introduced Luther as a comic fig
ure. Most people have heard of the old Straa
burg University, where the students presented
some drama yearly before magistrate and
guildman and courtier. The custom of giving
plays 'in English colleges was in force even
before the reign of Henry VII. and when
Elizabeth visited Cambridge in 1564 King's
College Chapel was transformed into a theater
and play after play was given by torchlight
in honor of the Queen.
No stene could be more impossible than that
In an American theater of to-day. And yet
the university, the traditional preserver of
what is great and good in our literature, might
well be proud of producing just a touch of en
thusiasm like that for plays that are good and
great. For plays and the stage are inevltabla
in modern life, and if they are vulgar and
commercial Just so do the people fall of proper
development.
The great actor Salvinl was once giving
"Othello" in a small Italian town. His au
dience watched every movement of the play
with growing Intensity. But when the catas
trophe came and . the Moor was about to
smother Desdemona the whole pit rose ln ;
wrath and horror and with execrations and
missiles drove him from the stage. /

"The Importance of Legal Education to
the. State" was the subject of the ad
dress delivered by James Milton Mannon
of the Hastings law college. He de
clared that the people are the true legis
lators of the state, and that the laws de
pend on the consent of the people.
"Lawyers are required," he said, "tÂ©
interpret the laws and frame new ones
when necessary. New laws are constant
ly demanded by the requirements of so
ciety, and the state is therefore inter
ested in having the w'ork well done. This
justifies the state college for the study of
law, for law is the foundation of all so
ciety. The judges are aided by the law
yers and the state must have honest and
competent judges and lawyers. Society
and the state are thus benefited by the
law college. More than half the mem
bers of political conventions and legisla
tures are lawyers, and If the state pro
vides for the education of its lawyers,
it is educating the state also, for the
legislatures represent the state. The law
school must" teach not only the laws, but
the reasons for them, and in sending out
from its halls well trained lawyers the
school is sending forth men who will in
fluence the law and frame new ones foe
the benefit of the commonwealth."
"To know the human body," he said,
"one must know the steps of Ha evolu

in the realm of science-. by systematic
methods of research. The future -will
show that practical medicine must be
founded on facts, which is the goal we
are striving to reach."

for it is ultimately the man behind the baggage

yearning to see the real in Its place with the

university of the chair known, through your
courteous action, as the Mills Professorship of
Intellectual aj!d Moral Philosophy and Civil
Polity. By your wise administration of the
fund which I was able to offer you for the sup
port of the chair and its objects, the fund has
itself been increased and supplemented by ju
dicious subsidies from your other resources,
has become the basis for the present large and
successful department of philosophy.

SACRAMENTO. May 14.â The floral pa
rade to-day was the great feature of the
street fair and May festival, and was j
by all odds the most spectacular and Im
pressive demonstration of the kind ever
witnessed in this city. Thousands of
spectators lined the streets and lustily
cheered the many striking features pre
sented. It seemed that all the floral
wealth of the great Sacramento Valley y
had been employed in the decoration of
the numerous vehicles which formed the
line of parade.
One fact that impressed itself upon vis
itors was that while Sacramento excel* '
in beautiful flowers, it also excels in fem
inine loveliness. Queen Fay was gladly
acclaimed all along the line. She was
seated In a beautiful victoria, drawn by
four horses and lavishly decorated with -
white pampas plumes and pink and white
carnations.
There were many novel features In thÂ»
way of decorations which called forth
the hearty applause ' of the multitude.
There was a: general suspension of busi
ness in the city this morning during the
parade.
To-night the Sacramento Driving Club
gave a parade of local driving horses.
There were many stylish turnouts in line.
The May Queen in the royal chariot
again made her appearance.

thought the Government ought to 'be in

; Dr. Roberts, when ' seen . to-day, said
that he' wrote . the '. letter to President

from knowledge of tho locality of the
camp site. . . ' '.
As a result of this letter, M. A'. Bolger,
a detective from the Curtln . agency in
San Francisco, made his appearance here
last week, and since . has been, quietly
investigating Dr. Roberts' standing and
reliability, as well as carefully looking
into the, truth of the statements in hia
letter to the President.
The question was reopened by a letter
which Dr. J. LÂ». , D. Roberts, a physician
of this place, wrote to. President Roose
velt shortly after the choice, of _the Na
ciemiento was announced. The physiciai
alleged that the. whole section included
in the 20,000 acres was unsuitable for a
camp of any kind on account of Its un
healthful conditions. The letter specifies
the undesirable features, asserting that
all the water was strongly impregnated
with ' alkali; that Â¦ the district was fever
infested and the land too poor to be of
any use for. any. sort of agriculture," and
that the heat in summer in'that region
was intense. He based these statements

KINGSTON, Jamaica, May 14.â The pro
visional government of Hay ti which was
established by Boiserond Canal, a former
President of Haytl, has pardoned the
Haytian exiles in Jamaica, who are ar
ranging to charter a steamer and proceed
to Port au Prince at the earliest oppor
tunity. According to reliable informa
tion which has reached here there will
be a continuation of the present serious
trouble in Hayti. The party supporting
Fouchard:in his claim to the Presidency
of Hayti is determined to make \ an ef
fort to get into power. â¢ .
s The northern revolutionists have slezed
the Â¦; customs houses ". of ! Cape . Haytlen,
Port' de Palx. arid' Gonalves;' and are J colr
lect/ng duties.- Protests against; this- ac
tion on the'; part of GeneralFirmin have
been entered by the national' bank and
the diplomatic corps. , - -
, A 'Â¦ severe" \ engagement â¢ between " the
northern i revolutionists and-the : southern
forces, meaning the troops from Port au
Prince and the cities of its vicinity, is
expected to take place to-morrow or the
day. after. A steamer from Kingston,
Jamaica, .is- expected here to-day or
Thursday, bringing a number of Haytians
who have been in exile. Among them are
Foucliard and Senoque Pierre, two more
candidates for the Presidency.
' The French steamer Olinde Rodriguez,
on which ex-President Sam . embarked
yesterday, is still in the harbor of Port
au Prince." She was to have sailed yes
terday, but was detained by the French
Minister,- M. de Prese. She will remain
here until a foreign warship reaches Porr
au Prince. The absence of a foreign
warship is causing great uneasiness in
the foreign' colony here.
After the embarkation of General Sam
all the -political prisoners here were re
leased and last night they, with groups of
drunken soldiers, paraded the streets.
Shots were fired from time to time, and
it was feared that the plundering of
stores and residences would follow. The
provisional government constituted by
Boiserond Canal, a former President, is
attempting to control the situation, but
General Saint Foix* Colin, the district
commander; General Kebeau, the chief cf
police, and Polinice, the communal mag
istrate, are the only officials who appear
to be exercising authority. They formed
a :corps of respectable citizens yesterday
and succeeded in disarming most of tne
dangerous characters. As a result the
night was much quieter than it would
otherwise have been. . .- . Â¦

In this increasing prosperity the workingmen of
the city can find ample reason for sustaining, the Re
publican policies of protection and sound money.
Prosperity of course depends mainly upon industry
and thrift, but without well ordered legislation" for

It is to be borne in mind that an increase of sav
ings deposits signifies something more than ap
pears in the figures themselves. For a considerable
period there has been a notable â¢ activity in the
building trades of the city,- and while there is no way
of estimating accurately how much of. that activity
is due to the building of workingmen's homes, or
how much of the savings of the wage-earners, has
been expended in that way, it is certain that the ag
gregate amount has been large. Moreover, other
large, sums have been employed in paying off debts
and mortgages upon homes erected by workingrnen
in former years. Finally, the . general increase of
prosperity has raised the standard of living; and the
great mass of the laboring population of the city has
lived better during the past year than during' the
period that followed the financial panic and indus
trial depression which were so disastrous to the
country. The bank deposits represent the savings
over and above those increased expenditures. "
Deposits in, savings banks represent in the mam
the prosperity of the working classes. It is true that
others than wage-earners sometimes make such de
posits, but as a rule it is the wage-earners or the men
and women of small salaries whose savings go to
banks of that character. An increase in . savings
bank deposits is therefore an unfailing register the
welfare and advancing wealth, of the labor of the

A PROOF OP PROSPERITY.
In the investigation into the conduct of, the Amer
ican army in the Philippines' ' which has been in
progress in Washington, it is said that the service
tends to derange the mind of the American soldier.
Perhaps after all this is the only rational defense of
the water cure. - .
As all efforts madeby our State Department since
the days of Olney have,becri met with so much ob
duracy on the part of the Russian Government 7 that
no encouraging results have been attained, it. seems
clear that more vigorous .efforts are necessary.
There i$ no reason why an American citizen -in
Russia should not be as well treated as a Russian is
treated in this country;. and, as we make no distinc
tion; of race or religion in our: citizenship,- we should
not permit others to make such distinctions. All
ttiat we have to' ask of the Russian " GovVr'nrrient';.' is
khatthe validity of the American passport -shall be
recognized no matter, by whom it.isborne.~ The is
sue is an important one, and. it is"_ gratifying;-: that
Congress has taken it up and roused the 'State De
partment; to :fenewed , efforts c to put ,an' end [to the
wrong.
It is conceded, of course, that Russia has. a fight
to exclude undesirable immigrants or travelers from
her soil. The United States refuses to. admit'Rus
sian anarchists, criminals or paupers, and Russia has
a right to exclude similar classes . of, Americans
should any of them desire to go to- that country.
That principle, however, does not apply to the' case
before us. The injustice of the course of the'Rus
sian Government lies in the fact that "discrimination
is made against certain persons of American birth
and citizenship not because they are criminal,-dis
eased or indigent, but solely because of their race'and
their religion. Against such discriminations it
would seem that we have not only a right to protest,
but that it is our duty to do so.
The report raises a problem for American consid
eration. It is no defense for wrong done to an
American citizen to say, that citizens of .other .coun
tries are treated just as badly,: nor should the appar
ent willingness of other countries to submit to the ill
treatment of their citizens be regarded as an excuse
for an equal willingness on bur part. The reference
of the Secretary to the treatment of Jews of other
lands is therefore irrelevant to . the issue/ Our sole
concern is with'the mannerin which that class of
American citizens arc treated by a Government
which for a long series of years has continued,
against our protestations, to act harshly and unjustly.
ir^ EPRESENTATIVE : GOLDFOGLE of New
p^, York recently procured the adoption by the
â¢Â¦Â¦ 'X House of a resolution calling upon Secretary
Hay for information concerning alleged discrimina
tions on the part of the Russian Government against
American citizens of the Jewish race. In . response
the Secretary has informed the House that "since
Secretary Olney's effcrts to secure equality of treat
ment for American citizens in Russia the position
of the State Department has not changed and its
efforts have been continued. They have not, how
ever, been attended, with encouraging^ success." The
Secretary added that he" has "no reason to.;believe
that American Jews are treated, by the Russians in
any way differently from the Jews of other nations.

RUSSIAN INTOLERANCE.
; San Francisco may well study- this empire of
wealth that has its commercial drainage to her har
bor, to her docks and warehouses. It will be an
enlightening experience for her business men and
will be appreciated by all the communities that are
visited. If there be Eastern business men or in
vestors sojourning among us, by all means let them
be invited to join the party. They will; get needed
knowledge. In the vast orange groves of the SacraV
mento they will smell the blossoms and see the form
ing fruit They will see the vineyards and .the or
chards, the wheat just heading and the bearded bar
ley yellowing for the reaper; They will see the cop
per and gold mines in action, the forests ripe for the
saw, and around it all an inspiration in the sunshine
and scenery that may be. enjoyed only^in California.
All this is framed in scenery of a beauty 1 and maj
esty that has -no rival, and is under a climate that no
la.nd can match. Every day in the. year that valley
is producing, something of value to commerce, and
the toil that develops it is performed under such
physical conditions -make it seem like the
pleasure of recreation to workers under the hard arid
exhausting climatic conditions of the East.
The next tour taken is to include the vast and rich
Sacramento Valley. It is better stored with natural
wealth than any similar area anywhere on the sur
face of the earth. From the gold and copper of its
upper stretch to the fruits and farm crops of its delta
lands that valley is a world in itself. There is no
want of man for the necessaries of life and no long
ing for its luxuries that Sacramento Valley cannot
supply.
The plan adopted cf sending the business and pro
fessional men of San Francisco on tours around the
State, to meet the people, study natural resources
and hail the men whose labor and enterprise are cd
vcloping them, promises - to add to commercial
knowledge the desirable element of personal and
sympathetic contact. All this may sound strangely
to an Eastern man, who has not in mind the vastness
of California. To travel over it, study its resources
and meet its people is as if a committee of New
Yorkers start on the road to study the country and
meet the people from their own city to Charleston,
S. C. In this desirable and pleasant survey of Cali-.
fornia these social and* commercial tourists come in
contact with a far greater variety of resources and
kinds of production than is found between New
York and Charleston. The methods and means of
development they will see are immensely greater in
number. Some of them would be as novel to a New
York business man as the processes of a modern
physical laboratory.

PERSONAL MENTION.
In advocating the new food the \Wisconsin. says:
"The horse is; the cleanest of. all animals, and there
fore his meat, is not unhealthful. We have had some (
experience in' horse beef and know what it is. In
1870 we were shur'up'for two months in the siege of
Paris, and horse beef was. served. up by not a few of
the restaurants under the title ; of .'fillet, de mouton.'
It is a palatable diet, but inasmuch as there, is "no
fat in the beer it is not' very nourishing. Meredith
M. Read, who was our' Consul General at the time
in Paris,- told us N^iat he lived during the whole siege
on' horse beef: It satisfied hunger, butvwas not a
nourishing diet. That is really the only objection to
horse meat. The animal before* being slaughtered;
was carefully inspected by a. veterinarian, and if pro
nounced free from disease it was sold to the public. \
It is . strange there should be any prejudice against
horse â¢ beef. The animal in all its habits is nearly'
"humanâ it is> so cleanly." \ j$ \"S. .-;
We present, the suggestion for what 'it', is'. worthy
To Californians of course it is of no value except as
a topic of current interest illustrating life in the East:
In this State we are not likely to be forced to eat
horses. If the worst comes we can live on prunes.
Still jj) is instructive to^note that since Chicago or
ganized the beef trust and raised prices Milwaukee
shows the country how to get^a horse on the trust.
There is one statement of the' Wisconsin, however,
that needs explanation. It says the "in all its
habits' is nearly human."- Is that -regarded in Mil
waukee as an argument for eating it? ...
Not one of the many suggestions has found much
favor. Fighting the trust- is a long'process and.peo
ple cannot wait breakfast and. dinner .until- the. trust
is busted. ;A diet -of herbs does not Suit the Ameri-.
can taste, and the adoption of it in "this ; instance
would seem too much like: a surrender to .'the" fust:
for it to be accepted even> with: as much grace as ,
might otherwise have been accorded ,it. Finally, the'
country has no desire To raise the-Belgian liare busi-;
ness again. One wrestle with' that rage is enough.'

SINCE the rapid and unexpected rise'in" the price
of beef there have been many counselors ad
vising the American people how to bring the
price; down again, or how to live and wax fat despite
of it. Some assert that the increased price is due-,tb
an arbitrary act of the beef trust and they applaud
the- President, for trying to bust it. Others declare
the, real cause of the advance, is an excessive demand
for beef, and they recommend the wholesale adop-^
tion of a vegetarian diet. "There' are others who sug

HONOLULU, May 7.â The fiftieth an
niversary of Hawaiian Lodge No. 21, Free
and Accepted Masons, was celebrated in
the Masonic Temple here on the night of
Monday, May 5. The rooms and hall -were
thronged with guests. _
The ceremonies were conducted by wor
shipful Master Frederick Whitney.
Seated with him on the dais were Judge
Morris M. Estee, past grand master of
the Grand Lodge of California; K. Oscar
White, master of Lodge Pacific, and Wal
lace R. Farrington, master of Lodge le
Progres. An interesting historical ad
dress of the Hawaiian Lodge was given

began with a sketch of Honolulu in the
early days and concluded with conditions
of to-day and an account of recent Ma

The Republican Central Committee,
after a discussion that has lasted several
weeks, has finally adopted primary rules
for the coming election. The discussion
was oVer the adoption of a rule allowing
all persortfe who wish to enroll themselves
on the precinct clubs to cast a vote up Or
the time of the closing- of the "polls, and'
placing . restrictions, such as requiring a
pledge to support the Republican party,
as a prerequisite for voting. Those who
favor the former plan prevailed, largely
on acount of the last convention having
declared for such a plan. The general
system of rules adopted makes the pre
cinct clubs the unit of the party and con
fines voting in the primary elections to
those who are on the club rolls. The
home rulers are preparing to adopt a
similar system. ./; \
Special'Corresnondence of The Call.
In the latest report of testimony offered by the
Cuban free-traders, under the instigation of the War
Department, is the evidence of Mr. Kelly, "exten
sively interested in Cuban sugar-growing." He
swore that the Cuban sugar-growers would be the
beneficiaries of free trade, and that the refiners would
not gain anything from it. This, of course, is in
tended to relieve the issue of any incubus that "might
be caused by the interest of the sugar trust. But it
does not remove a .single offensive feature of the
fantastic proposition. It simply brings the issue;
again between the American and Cuban sugar
growers. , '
The American farmer pays American wages and
American taxes. He is paying now the cost of the
war which gave Cuba her independence and will go
on paying pensions on the same account for many
years to come. The benefit given to the Cuban
planters is taken out of the pocket of the American
farmer. But the Cuban .planter pays neither Ameri
can pensions and wages nor American taxes. He
<Joes not pay a dollar of the cost of making his isl
and independent. The only way to get anything
from him for all that was spent to make him free is
by putting a tariff on his sugar and tobacco. But
the Secretary of War and Economics says that we
are under obligations to the Cuban planters and 'they
are under none to us! If this view had been sug
gested before the Spanish war Weyler would still be
Captain General and the Secretary of War would
not "be dividing with him the horror of reconcentra
tion camps and the butchery of children.
As far as our domestic production of sugar con
cerns the farmers the Secretary of Agriculture should
be heard, for the taxpayers maintain his department
by a large expenditure for the purpose of having at
hand expert knowledge for the benefit of the tillers
of the soil. The past reports of the Secretary of
Agriculture show him "To be enthusiastic for beet
sugar as a conspicuous addition to our farm crops.
As a fiscal question the Secretary of the Treasury is
especially charged with expert functions in regard to
the tariff, which it is proposed to reduce or. abolish.
The committees of Congress in charge of the ques
tion have not called the Secretary of Agriculture nor
the Secretary of the Treasury. But the Secretary of
War seldom sees a day when he is too busy to favor
Congress with instructions upon a question that
does not belong to his department at all, and with an
immodesty that is mere than zeal invades the func
tions of two departments in a matter which is their
business and not his. k â¢
Suppose the case were reversed and the Secretary
of Agriculture were daily issuing orders to Congress
respecting things that belong to the War Depart
ment. There is openly expressed disgust and horror
at the military methods employed in the Philippines.
Suppose the Secretary of the Treasury should take
advantage of this feeling uttered by Senator Lodge
and Representative Sibley and other' Republicans
and proceed to instruct Congress to order the War
Department to reverse its policy, would not the Sec
retary of War demand the resignation of Wilson and
Shaw, or resign himself?
Everybody knows that that would be the result
of such a game of cross purposes and interference in
the Cabinet. Then why does not somebody resign
when Secretary Root daily goes outside of his duty
on anterrand that not only humiliates two other
members of the Cabinet but threatens the prosperity
of the country and the supremacy of the Republican
party?
The frequency and effrontery with which an im
proper thing is done may make it safer to do by
getting the people to accept persistence for pro-"
priety, but all the \ people cannot be fooled, and
those whqjcannot be will finally dictate the admoni
tion that will reach the responsible party ' who
needs it.
WE have had occasion to call attention to the
impolitic utterances indulged .in by the pro
moters of free trade with Cuba.' The De
partment of War and Economics, through Mr. Sec
retary Â¦Root^ has ceaselessly urged free trade upon
the, Republican party:- It had been supposed that un
der the administrative organization of our Govern
ment such questions . belonged to other Cabinet
officers.

"I treated a man named Waterson,"
said Estes to Lick, "and when I saw that
Lick became very much worried over
his investment when he read in The Call
of Waterson's reappearance and immed
iately started looking for Estes. The doc
tor told him that he sold him the claim
in good faith, believing that he was re
ally entitled to $350, particularly as the
claim was approved by Public Adminis
trator Boland.
The strange part of the affair is that
Waterson. says he never received any
medical treatment from Estes, though
the physician's bill shows that he treat
ed Waterson for four months for nervous
prostration. Estes sat up with Waterson
at least half a dozen nights, he states in
his bill, and charged for those services
at the rate of $25 per night. He also
made .him several visits at $5 per visit.
Estes also renders a bill for quantities
of chloride of potash and' chloral hydrate,
which he claims he furnished Waterson.

Waterson. Waterson is the cobbler who
was reported dead, and the claim Estes
held against his estate was for medical
services. The claim, which was for 5330,
was approved by the Public Administra
tor and would have been worth more
than the sum Lick paid for It had it (not
been discovered that Waterson was ln

WASHINGTON, May U.-In the pres
ence of a large audience President Roose
velt to-day laid the cornerstone of the
McKinley Memorial Ohio College of Gov
ernment of the American University; lo
cated a few miles outside of this city in
the northwestern part of the District of
Columbia. When completed the building
will be devoted to studies embracing dip-,
loxnncy, municipal government, arbitra
tion, civics and international law.
On the platform besides the President
were Secretary of Agriculture Wilson,
Secretary' Hay, Senators Hanna and Dol
liver, Bishop Willard F. Mallalleu of
Massachusetts and many men prominent
in educational and church work.
Senator Dolliver. of Iowa spoke briefly
of the life and character of the late Presi
dent McKinley and said that it was fit
ting that his name should be connected
witn a school of public science. Senator
Hanna, wnose voice trembled with emo
tion, said in part:
"That cornerstone has beneath it a ;
foundation more enduring than granite.
It is immortality, and that was the~ foun
dation of McKlnley's life. Upon this sub- j
ject I cannot sneak as 1 would, my
friends. The memories which come to me j
on an occasion like this are too painful j
to dwell on. Our beloved President is i
here to-day in spirit and if that sacrifice
were needed that we might search our
hearts to learn /ivherein we could do
higher and nobler deedsâ if that example j
were necessary to inspire the young men
of this country to broader and more lib
oral and higher motives of social and gov- !
ernmental life, then indeed: 'His will, not
ours, be done.' "
The speechmaking closed with a brief
address by President Roosevelt, who said:
"Ladies and Gentlemenâ I am to say but
a. word. Nothing more may be said than
has been said already by those who have
addressed you this afternoon â the states
men who worked with McKinley and the
pastor under whose ministrations he sat.
It is indeed appropriate that the Method
ists of Americaâ the men belonging to
that religious organization- which fur
nished the pioneers in carving out of the
West what is now the heart of the great
American republic â should found this
great university in the city of Washing
ton and should build the college that is to
teach the science of government in the
name of the great exponent of good and
strong government, who died last fall:
who died as truly for this country as
Abraham Lincoln himself. I thank you
for having given me the opportunity this
afternoon to come before you and lay
the cornerstone of this building."
The President then, with a trowel in
hand, threw in the mortar and the stone
was lowered into position. At some later
date it will be raised sufficiently high to
permit the placing of a number of relics
in th~^inc box within. The doxology was
sung at the President's request and the
services closed with a benediction.

I We will loan you the money for a regular banking
rate of interest â six per cent And you can pay tjs
.backUittle by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the ..first-class furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big and fresh and where satisfaction is certain, and
when you have made your selection you can pay your
bill in full with good, hard cash.
Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
and being compelled to select your goods from smaller
and inferior stocks?
The installment stores charge you . ten per cent
above their cash prices when you ask for long credit
All you pay us is six per cent 7^
For example: If your purchases amount to $100.00
we will charge you $io6.ooâ which is a six per cent
advance; then you pay us $20.00 cash and the balance
in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month.
If your purchases amount to $75.00 we will charge you

. Hartmeyer grabbed hold of the two
men and compelled them to accompany
him to the Hall of Justice. He explained
to Lieutenant Martin why he had them
'in. custody and Policeman Dougherty was
.instructed to take them to the prison, where
they: were booked on a 1 charge of grand
larceny. They gave their names as Fred
Ross and Charles W. Ryan and said they
both came from Ohio. Detective Bain
bridge recognized Ross as one of the sus
picious characters who were gathered in
during the late President McKinley's visit
to this city. It is supposed he came here
then from the East. Nothing is known
about Ryan.
There was a crowd in front of a saloon
on Market street, . between Third arid
Fourth, yesterday afternoon looking at
the bears in the window, when G. W.
Hartmeyer, who says he is a former de
tective from Chicago, thought he would
play the "sleuth." He mixed among the
crowd and in a few minutes felt a hand in
his hip pocket, where he kept a purse con
taining stami^s and cards. He waited pa
tiently till the hand was withdrawn. Then
he turned swiftly confronting two young
men, one of whom dropped the purse to
the sidewalk.

The Board of Education adopted a reso
lution yesterday in which it finds that the
charges of inability : to maintain .proper
discipline at the Polytechnic High School
made . against William Zimmerman, a
teacher in that school, were fully sus
tained . at an investigation. Zimmerman
was relieved from further duty at the
Polytechnic School, but will continue as
German teacher in the Girls' High School.
He will suffer a monthly reduction of $40
in salary by the. board's action. The
cnarges were preferred by W. N. Bush,
principal of the Polytechnic School.

Success of tlie Affair Is Much
Greater Ttan Was
Expacted.
Toe ladies of Sacred Heart parish enter
tained nearly 2000 guests last night at
their kettledrum party in the old Sutro
house on Hayes street, near Flllmore.
The affair was successiul in every par
ticular, much more so, in fact, than had
been anticipated.
The house was elaborately decorated
with bunting and flowers. Refreshments",
which called forth much praise for the
culinary abilities of the ladies of the par
ish, were provided In lavish abundance. A
pleasing musical programme furnished en
tertainment throughout almost the whole
of the evening. The committee In charge
did everything possible to make the occa
sion a very agreeable one. Aside from
the mogrammed features of the affair,
Uie quests were afforded the opportunity
to tnjoy themselves informally in con
versation and parlor games. The even
ing closed with a dance.
Tlie proceeds from the party will be
used in defraying the expenses of mov
ing the building and fitting it up for a
parochial school. It was stated last night
by those in charge that more than the
amount desired to accomplish the in
tended purpose was raised.
The musical programme consisted of a
vocal soio by Robert Lloyd, piano solo
by Miss Alice Devine, vocal solo by Mrs.
John Madden, violin solo by Miss Rose
Lane, vocal solo by Miss Grace.de For
rest, humorous specialties by William J.
Hyies. vocal duet by Mrs. L. P. River
arid Miss Gertrude Hopkins, cornet solo
by Dr. Edward Beach, vocal solo by Mrs.

gramme received an emphatic encore.
Father Hugh Lagan, pastor of the par
ish, abiy assisted by Mrs. John Mahony,
Mrs. Daniel Sullivan and Mrs. Kate Sup

Sequoia Lodge Takes the Initiative
to Provide for Incapacitated
Members.
Sequoia Lodge No. 1SS, Knights of
Pythias, at its regular meeting held last
Tuesday evening took the initiative in
putting in tangible shape a movement to
build a home for the members of the or
der who can no longer continue in the
struggle for life or who are incapacitated
by sickness or age from following their
I'.sual vocations. It was considered an
cfportune time to engage In an active
campaign for this important movement
on account of the convening in this city
en next Monday evening of the Grand
Lodge of the domain of California, with
Us 4J0 delegates representing 200 active
lodges and over 13.000 members.
The home is to be a refuge for all en
titled to its benefits within the States of
California; 'Washington. Oregon, Idaho,
I2Ceyada. Utah and Montana, and an insti
tution that will be a monument and an
henor to. the grand principles of frater
nity and benevolence which this order ex
emplifies.
The members present subscribed the
sum of $1000 as a nucleus for this fund,
and the chancellor commander. Dr. R. E.
lJur.ktr, in addition to a money subscrip
tion, announced that he would donate a
s;ite situated in one of the ideal spots of
California, in Alameda County, near the
tewn of San Leandro, the site to consist
of as much land as may be necessary to
bu!!d a home worthy of the order.
A committee consisting of Gustave
Pohlrr.ann, W. J. Smith, I. Schwartz, Er
i:c-st Duden, H. "W. Levy, Frank Stohr
and Dr. R. E. Bunker was appointed to
tr.ke the necessary steps for the prelim
inary work of organizing and outlining a
ir.cde of procedure for obtaining the co
operation of the lodges and members of
the order west of the Rockies. This com
mittee will meet Saturday evening and
prepare a plan of action.
The lodges of this jurisdiction have been
raying a per capita tax for a number of
years and have accumulated $8000 in a
fund for this purpose, and at the session
of the Grand Lodge to be held next week
no doubt this fund will be combined with
the fund now being raised.
Sequcia Lodge is preparing to Initiate
Mi,yor Schmitz and Chief of Police Wltt
rcan. The candidates will be Initiated In
the page and esquire rank at the next
meeting of the lodge. The knights' rank
will be exemplified in amplified form on
1-iiday evening, followed by the evolu
tions of the drilled teams of Unity, Ivan
. hoe and Bay City lodges of San Francisco
End Dirigo Lodge of Oakland.
Three suits were begun In the Justices'
Court yesterday by Jules C. Gamage

THE fourteenth annual meeting of
the San Francisco District Asso
ciation of the Woman's Home Mis
sion Society of the California Con-
ferer.ee took place yesterday at
Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, Capp
and Twentr-first streets.'
The morning session opened with prayer
delivered by Miss Cedora Cheney.
Words of welcome were cordially ex
tended the delegates by Mrs. Jennie C.
"Winston. She said that the district was
especially distinguished for its officials,
yet, while they appreciated their strength
and influence, they looked for a time
when women of leisure would assist in the
good work. The speaker drew a compari
son between the merchants who visited
the San Joaquin Valley recently with the
object of promoting a stronger business
relationship, and said that their "district"'
was called upon in the same wayâ to ex
tend its Influence as a promoter of the
Home Missionary Society. More auxil
iaries meant more money for Christianiz
ing the heathen and assisting in the
spread of charity.
Mrs. C. B. Perkins, recording secretary,
reported her work during the year.
Mrs. M. A. Lakin, corresponding secre
tary, wished it was possible to receive
quarterly reports from all auxiliaries. One
soldier, she said, could do iittle in battle.
It needed the whole force to do effective
work, and she besought strong and unani
mous exertion on the part of the auxil
iaries.
Miss Elizabeth Crummie. treasurer, re
ported that the society was free from
debt and the finances of the organization
were batisfactory. though there were sev
eral auxiliaries yet to be heard from. The
leport was received with applause.
Reports were made, all showing that the
greatest energy Is being displayed in the
1 espective departments. Mrs. C. G. , Da
viÂ« presented her report - on "Juvenile
Work"; Mrs. H. E. Milnes on "Mite
Boxes"; Mrs. William O. Discho. "Lit
erature"; Mrs. William Abbott, "Publica
tions," and Miss Mary E. Robertson,
"Systematic Giving." â¢":.-; ,Â¦â¢
YOUTH TAUGHT INDUSTRY.
In connection with the report on Juvenile
work the president pointed out the advan
tages of the "Mothers' Jewels" work and
sought a contribution of 10 cents a year
from each child, which went toward the
support of the home where many of the
children were , orphans. Each child, said
Mrs. Winston, was indulged In his or her
preference as to work. If a boy of the
"Mothers' Jewels Home" -shows an in
clination to follow farming as a living he

dian work, Mrs. S. F. Harrison, San Fran-
Dr. W. W. Case, presiding elder of San
Francisco district,' said he was impressed
with the work of the wCmen, young wo
men especially, in the missionary work,
and regretted so few young women could
glve : an intelligent account of the mis
sionary fields, our misslonaries^and their
work. . It was , the world's salvation. He
hoped that the assemblage would help
him to bring men to the front.
Deaconess â¢ Gray spoke on Japanese
work, and in course of her remirks re
gretted that the same amount of laber
was not given in the direction of edu
cating Japanese children of the city as
was bestowed upon Chinese children. Two
missionaries had told her that -Japanese
and' American men were trafficking in
Chinese women, and the society was do
ing great work in the matter of rescu
ing the slaves. The deaconess deplored
that any such condition should exist. â¢
The following officers were elected for
the ensuing year:
WOMAN'S WORK GOOD.
The deaconess* hour was conducted by
Mrs. L. J. Sims, and proved to be one
of the very instructive portions of Â¦ the
day's ceremony. The account of the
missionary, work done at the Presidio was
graphically described { by Mrs. Lincoln,
who Is deaconess there. She told of Lie
assistance given sick soldiers, even to
writing and mailing their letters to rela
tives, and decorating the tables in the
sick wards with flowers and supplying
magazines, all work that was accepted
with deep gratitude by the men. iÂ»irs.
Lincoln pleaded for a stamp fund for the
(benefit of invalid soldiers. The idea was
considered, and many present were en
rolled as monthly subscribers to the
fund. f
At the afternoon session Deaconess Mi
ner of British Columbia, Dr. and Mrs.
Larkin and Miss Lillian Marks, the socie
ty's missionary from Agsmere, India,
were t introduced.
Miss Marks spoke feelingly of her in
terest in the home and foreign missions.
Mrs. Hamilton, wife of Bishop Hamil
ton of San Francisco, was also Introduced
during the afternoon session.
The Richmond auxiliary was formally
received into fellowship with the San
Francisco District Woman's Home.
At the close of presidents' hour the
morning, session terminated with noon
tide prayer, and about fifty of the ladies
present partook of a bountiful and dain
tily served luncheon, served in a room ad
joining the church.
Presidents' hour was not the last of
the interesting events of the meeting,
for it was taken up with the reading of
a series of concise and useful reports
from each auxiliary.-
Mrs. A. C. Bane spoke on the subject
of "Systematic Giving-," and protested
that God had not set an example in char
itable or church work in the form of
church fairs, church dinners or "rum
mage sales," for the Lord, she said, aid
not ask for offerings only of the first
fruits. A "rummage sale" meant the go
ing to one's closet and getting disused
and old garments which were sold. God,
said Mrs. Bane, would never set his seal
on that method. She advised tithings
and free-will offerings and spontaneous
gifts.
SYSTEMATIC GIFTS.
Mrs. Winston announced that very
shortly their missionaries would be called
upon to exert their energies in the Philip
pines in view of the great and still grow
ing influence of the Methodist Episcopal
church in the islands.
The report on "Mite Boxes," presented
by Mrs/ H. E. Milnes, showed an advance
forward in the collections. The aggregate
membership of the twelve auxiliaries was
something like 300, who have placed 214
boxes in the hands of the people. The
total amount realized was $134 85. Last
year, with two hundred boxes, but $70 was
collected. Â¦
aim is to inculcate in the children habits
of thrift and industry.
The evening session was largely attend
ed, and the addresses made by the Rev.
Or. Coyle and the Rev. Dr. F. M. Larkin
were listened to with profound attention.
Dr. Coyle gave an Interesting and graphic
description of the hardships endured by
the missionaries who penetrate the moun
tain fastnesses and overcome almost in
surmountable obstacles to carry the Gos
pel to those who are practically cut off
from the world. Dr. \Larkin spoke in sim
ilar strain, and won I the sympathy, of his
hearers for the missionary.

PAINE'S CELEBY COMPOTTND.
An Dnepaled Record.
PAIIE'S CELERY
COMPOUND.
The Only Medicine That Can
Point With Pride to True
and MamMs Cures.
ITS PRAISES SOUNDED
BY ALL CLASSES OF
OUR PEOPLE.
A Spring Medicine That Quickly
Purifies the Blood and
-Banishes Disease.
Paine's Celery C?r;Â»:>ound can with pride
point to a long urd wonderful list of
cures effected fh thi.- and other lands. In
fully ninety cases out of every hundred
it has been successful in overcoming and
banishing treacherous and long-standing
diseases and ailments. '
The great work of disease banishing
and life saving so happily accomplished
by Paine's Celery Compound has not been
confined to any particular class of people.
All ranks and conditions of our popula-
tion â among which are found city toilers,
hard-working f armers.feusiness men, cap-
italists, clergymen, lawyers, physicians
and legislators owe their lives and pres-
ent good health to the curing virtues of
Paine's Celery Compound.
No other medicine in the world to-day
has- been so much talked of, so highly
recommended by medical men, so gener-
ally indorsed "by our best people as
Paine's Celery Compound. It truly de-
serves all the good words spoken in its
favor.
May is the great month for recuperating
and building up the weakened and dis-
eased system. At this time we press upon
the ailing, the , nervous, the rheumatic,
the neuralgic, the dyspeptic, old and
young, the necessity of using Paine's Cel-
ery Compound. To those 'who are suffer-
ing and , despondent owing to the rapid
progress of bloo^l troubles, kidney disease
and liver complaint, we say, "use the
great health giver at once if you would be
speedily restored to health." The virtues
peculiar to Paine's Celery Compound are
as potent and true for you to-day as they
proved powerful and effective for your
friends and neighbors weeks and months
ago.

tcr will give a testimonial farewell benefit
to its > popular leading- lady. Miss Annette
Marshall, who will take leave of the thea

tacular melodrama, Is the bill of the week,
and Is serving to astonish and delight the
Central clientele with its startling me
chanical illusions and electrical effects.
Next week in the new bill, "Woman
Against Woman," Miss Fannie Mclntyre,
the new. leading lady, will make her first
appearance.
"Reilly and the 400" is delighting good
bouses at the Grand Opera-house this
week. Mr. Harrigan is of the very best
in his line of work and has a valuable
medium for the exercise of his peculiar
talent in "Reilly and the 400," also a
product of the author-actor's clever pen.
!he Grand Opera-house stock company
does very good work In support, and the
bill is amusing large numbers of play
goers. "Waddy Goc-gan" will be the next
bill and the last of the Harrigan engage
ment. Miss Maude Fealey, youngest lead-
Ing lady on the stage, will follow in "The
Little Minister."
A night with the Elks, to take place at
the Grand Opera-house next Tuesday,
promises to be a gala affair. In addi
tion to Edward Harrlgan and the Grand
Opera-house company in "Waddy Goo
gan," star attractions from the various
theaters will appear. The sale of seats
is now progressing at the box office, with
an Immense demand, and the audience
promises to be large "and fashionable. The
members of San FrancJsco Lodge No. 3
are working with, might and main to
make the affair a success, and many sur
prises will be offered during the perform
ance.
"The Singing Girl" still draws crowds
to the popular Tlvoll Opera-house, and
there is no\ foretelling the end of the
run of this pretty opera. The people are
all well placed, and together with the
orchestra and chorus make the piece go
finely. To-night is "machinists^ night"
at the Tivoli. After the present opera
comes "The Toy Maker/' which scored
such a hit with everybody last year. It
will be given with an enlarged cast, new
properties, songs and verses.
There are still overflowing: houses at
every performance of "Fiddle Dee Dee,"

â¢jr. /Tf ISS FANNY McINTYRE, the
AYfll Central Theater's new leading
i W \\ la( * y> tnlnlcs Manager Fred
JL V JJL Belasco one* of the cleverest
contract-makers in the country.
She stated yesterday that Belasco painted
San Francisco wuh such glowing colors
that without a minute's hesitation she
packed her trunks and boarded a train en
route for this city. Miss Mclntyre confi
dentially whispered that she was told by
Belasco that she could study her parts
under the pines. Since heÂ£ arrival MSs
Mclntyre has been given the principal
role In the celebrated emotional drama,
"Woman Against Woman," in which she
makes her initial appearance next Mon
day night. With a fourteen-page manu
script in her hands the leading lady went
in search of the pines, but was informed
they were growing in Golden Gate Park.
A3 she could not tell a pine from a spruce
tree, she decided to study the role in her
room. She therefore laid- in a stock of
sweet peas, and whenever she tired of
her lines a whiff of these fragrant flowers
inspired her to go ahead with her studies.
MissMcIntyre has a pleasing personality
and possesses magnetism. She says love
scenes are her long suit, and she dies beau
tifully on the stage. / She expresses the
hope that the gallery gods will not inter
rupt these emotional scenes by untimely
interruptions, as they might throw her
out of her stride.
"Back in dear old Philadelphia,"- she
said, "the gods and myself became aw
fully good friends. Why, they used to
call me Fanny, and of course I could not
object to this familiarity, as they were
all my friends. I played frequently in
Boston, but I found the people a little
'up stage.' You know I mean they were
too refinedâ too criticalâ but nevertheless
I made good. I do hope I will please local
audiences. I'll strive to do my best, and
if personal effort will bring success I will
surely become popular.
"You have no twice-a-day theaters
here, but you will have them, of course,
before long, for I am told that the Ori
ental trade is going to make of San Fran
cisco a veritable New York of the West.,
Well, a , twice-a-day .theater Is not so
much of -a pleasure to the.-actors as it
may be profitable to the houses, perhaps,
although one gets used to the every-day
matinee after all.. At Forepaugh's in
Philadelphia I played for over a year
twice a day, and I had a like experience
at the American Theater, New York. I
made a starring tour with Wilton Lack
aye through the large cities of the East,
and that was comparative ease and en
joyment. I appeared in 'Lover's Lane', at
McVlcker's in Chicago and gave a season
of 'Cymbeline' in St. Louis, playing Imo
gen. My repertoire In the East Included
'The Sporting Duchess,' 'The Little Minis
ter,' 'Under the Re.d Robe,' 'Aristocracy,'
'Camille' and a host of other popular
plays. I know I shall be enamored of San.
Francisco. "If Calif ornians are . all like
those I have met in the East you can't
help loving them. I suppose the climate
here makes them that wayâ for they are
pleasant, cheerful, agreeable, delightful. I
Imagine that I, too, shall be singing the'
praises of this Western land before long."
John Drew in "The Second In Com
ir.&nd" has made the turn in the long lane
cf his career. Potent always for pleas
ure, he commands in the role of Major
Christopher Blngham a power of pathos
that fully equals his rich comedy gifts,
and has created a figure that will stand out
distinctively among the few distinguished
portraits of the day. He is very well sup
ported in the interpretation of Captain
Marshall's play, . Guy Standing as his
lucky rival; Ida Conquest and the rest of
the cast fulfilling all needs. The houses
have beep commensurate with the attrac
tions of the play and players, and to sup
ply the demand for seats there was given
an extra matinee yesterday and another
has been arranged : for Wednesday next.
Mr. Drew remains only two weeks. Miss
Kathryn Kidder in a revival of "The
Country Girl" follows. .
The Neilis are being seen to particular
advantage this week at the " California
Theater In Bronson . Howard's â¢ comedy,
"Aristocracy." The company has spread
Itself on the production, in which are to
be seen some of the handsomest costumes
that have been shown on the local stage.
Mr. Nelll has the role of Jefferson Stock
ten, and does much for the part, being
ably supported by Clifford Dempeey, who
is a very persuasive, princely villain. Miss
Chapman is more than commonly, goodâ
which is saying not littleâ as Diana Stock
ton, and Miss Stone, the beauty/ of the
company, acts and looks the part of Vir
ginia Stockton very becomingly. "The
Lottery of Love," always a favorite with
auoiences; will ' be next week's bill. . Tho
usual Thursday afternoon bargain â¢ mati
nees are on.
"Lost 24 Hours" is making Alcazar audi
ences very. merry this week. . Next week
the popular little theater will have
possibly ; the i most â¢ amusing ; of the
vtry recent farces In "The Brixton
Burglary," by Fred W. Sidney. It haj
been the farcical Â¦ success of London and
New York for two seasons, and Is certain
to f be much ; appreciated Â¦ by Â¦ local play
goers. The management is to be congrat
ulated I on securing such - an excellent' at
traction, : and will no doubt reap, the bene
fit of its enterprise.';. The /farce will ; re
ceive unusual care in its putting on, and
there are to be some stunning gowns.:
Next Friday evening the Central Thea-
* FIREMEN RESIGN.â The following firemen
sent in their reslsmatlons yesterday: .W.

FERNBROOK PARK, which Is em- i
bosomed among- the densely wood
ed hills surrounding: Nlles Canyon,
was the scene of a delightful fam
ily picnic yesterday when the mem
bers of the San Francisco Hay Dealers' As
sociation and their friends betook them
selves to the picturesque park to enjoy
their annual outing. The Hay Dealers'
Association is but a small organization,
composed of scarcely more than half a
hundred members, yet it enjoys a wide
popularity. Although yesterday's excur
sion to the hills was not given to raise
money and no attempt was made to swell
' the attendance, there were In the neigh
borhod of 1000 picnickers present.
The boat for the park left this city at 9
o'clock in the morning and when the peo
ple reached the other eide of the bay the
rain was pouring heavily. Long before
the train, reached its destination, how
ever, the sun was shining brightly and
the day turned out a beautiful one.
After the excursionists had reached the
park and the heavily laden lunch
baskets had been lightened of their
tempting contents, the picnickers pro
ceeded to enjoy themselves. Excellent
music was provided, and while many
danced, others formed themselves into
parties to climb the steep hills in the vi
cinity in search of wild flowers and ferns,
which had been freshened and made more
beautiful by the early morning rain.
But wen the delights of Fernbrook
Park, clothed in all the beauties of spring,
could not allure the minds of some from
their business. Early in the day It was
reported that Ed Aigeltinger, Philip Ans
pacher and Captain Pete Demlng had be-
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
After the regular programme of races
had been completed. Mrs. Ed- Algeltinger
and Mrs. Ernest Beringer were induced to
run in a special race for fat ladles. The
race proved so exciting and so evenly
contested that the judges were unable to
select the winner. Both the ladles wert
highly complimented on the graceful rrian
ner in which they acquitted themselves.

Other topics than the organization of
the convention have recently claimed the
attention of the machine managers. The
increasing weakness of Gage as a candi
date for Governor and the apprehension
in machine circles that he could not win
out in November if nominated cannot be
passed over lightly. Comment is made
everywhere that a term of four years as
Governor is high reward for the best kind
of party service. The suggestion that
Gage should hold the office eight years
is not acceptable to thousands of voters
who take but little interest in general
politics, but who have pronounced opin
ions in the subject of fair dealing In pub
lic affairs. California has had many illus
trious Governors, but a term of four
years was deemed sufficient honor for the
greatest and best. The current of talk
has suggested a change in the boss pro
gramme. Two months ago It was high
treason in the boss camp to discuss the
danger of Gage's defeat. Now such talk
is common. Gage has been told of his un
popularity. Of course, he does not like
to hear about it. He would rather hear
Dave Kevane, Ben Fehneman, Alec Tru
man and Johnny Mackenzie tell him that
the. people are so proud of his ability as
an executive that they want him to serve
as Governor for life.
Immediately after primary election,
August 12, the machine politicians will
claim everything. Candidates for nomi
nation to the offices of Lieutenant Gov
ernor, Controller, Secretary of State,
Treasurer, Attorney General, State Print
er, Superintendent of Schools, Surveyor
and Clerk of the Supreme court will be
urged to hand over to the bosses what
ever stiength they possess in several dele
gations.
The boss cry will be: "Hurry up ar.d
get aboard the band wagon." The chances
are three to one that every candidate
joining the boss procession will be turned
down by the convention. In the first
place, the stalwart Republicans who are
battling for good government are as well
organized as the boss forces. Indications
point to the election of Hon Jacob H.
Neff as chairman of the convention. The
bosses have not openly named their can
didate, but certain movements in the
boss camp disclose the identity of the
statesman slated by the machine for the
work of presiding over the convention.
Thl3 year the Republicans of California
are more earnest than ever before in
their demands that the delegates to the
convention shall be chosen by the voters
of the party. Every scheme of the bosses
to pack the convention with appointed
delegates will be exposed and resisted.
The machine manipulators did expect to
apply to the State convention the system
of tactics which gave them the upper, hand
in the late Republican Municipal Con
vention in this city. The day after the
primary election in San Francisco the
bosses began shouting that Crimmins,
Herrin and Burns had the convention.
Candidates for ' municipal office were
advised to turn over to Burns the dele
gates representing their individual
strength. The silly aspirants who were
entrapped by this game got the rough
end of the bargain. Several were defeated
for nomination and others nominated and
defeated at the polls. ' .
For the first ttonelin many campaigns
the Democrats may be compelled to put
their State ticket in the field before the
Republican convention . adjourns. A3
the primary elections under the law can
not be held until August 12, the nominat
ing conventions cannot very well assem
ble before Monday.' August 25. Many Ra
publican politicians favor September 1 as
the time of meeting, in order to give am
ple opportunity for the transmission of
returns from far away Assembly dis
tricts. As a rule the Republicans are
more methodical and orderly in the work
of preparing for a convention than the
Democrats.
Willoughby became known to the great
naturalists of both America and Europe
through his study of natural history. He
went all through Alaska, picking up cu
rios and unearthing- the bones of the
great mastodon and other extinct ani
mals, sending some of the most valuable
of these to the large museums of the
world. A collection sent to the World's
Fair at Chicago was of great value to
the students of natural hfrstory. His
knowledge of Alaska and its natural re
sources made him much sought oy ex
ploring parties. He was the discoverer
of the Silent City, one of the greatest
phenomena of the world. It is a perfect
picture of a city without an inhabitantâ
a mirage over Muir Glacier.
Despite his once great wealth, Wil
loughby had little at the time of his
death.
The life story"of the aged pioneer dates
back with the history of the first white
rr.en that crossed the mountains to the
Pacific Coast. -He crossed the plains and
mountains f/om Missouri to California in
IMS, and was on the coast at the time
of the great strikes of '49. Â¦ He was suc
cessful with others at that time. After
the excitement in California he followed
the coast north, landing at Seattle in
1S5S, and went with the Thompson ex
pedition that followed the Indians east
of the mountains. On the return of that
expedition he went into British Columbia
and was one of the discoverers of the
Caribou region, where he made a big
stake, washing out $125,000 in gold in a
few davs. A
From Caribou he went to Cassiar aifft
was one of the discoverers of that re
gion. He spent three years there, mak
ing a big strike. In the early sixties he
went to- Alaska, locating on the - coast
near where Fort Wrangel now stands.
He discovered the bay Vnereon -Juneau is
now located, Berners Bay, Sumdum,
Sheep Creek, Hunters Bay and other good
fields. â¢
SEATTLE, May 14.â Richard G. Wil
loughby, known along the coast as "Dick"
Willoughby, one of the oldest pioneers
of Alaska, and a man who was one of
the makers of the early history of the
Pacific Coast and the Northwest, died
here this morning at the age of 75 years.
Willoughby came to Seattle last fall from
Alaska and has been ill since that time
with a comDlication of diseases.

MEAT QUESTION SETTLED.
Bight Food to Take Its Place.
"The shortness of the meat supply and
the high price of steak Is not an unmiti-
gated evil. On the contrary, it is a prob-
able blessing:," eays the Brooklyn Eagle.
"It meat could be raised to a price that
would make it prohibitory It might still
be of grood result, because It would teach
those. who depend almost entirely upon It
to widen their dietary and learn to enjoy
many rood things of which they are now
Ignorant. To many, especially in the cities,
there are but three foodsâ meat, potatoes
end bread. The weary monotony of this
programme, the unsatisfied but Indefinite
longings for a widening of It, affect appe-
tite and surely affect spirits and temper.
"The laborer goes to bis work filled
with meat, potatoes and bread. At noon
be finds cold meat and bread In his din-
ner pall, and at night he Is confronted by
meat and potatoes, sometimes separate,
scmetlmes combined Into a greasy etew,
sometimes chopped Into hash.
"This kind of thing fills him, but in a
finer sense It can hardly be said to feed
him. Physicians have discovered that; a
limited and unchanging diet lowers vital-
ity and health."
Such a time as this gives every one an
opportunity to test the value of Grape-
Kuts as a food and prove to themselves
that It more than takes the place of meat
and really furnishes more nourishment
for the body and greater strength and
vitality for the brain and nervous system;
It is also an economical food that reduces
the cost of living to the minimum.
Grape-Nuts are probably entitled to the
claim to be the most perfectly adapted
food for human needs how extant. The
meat eater and the vegetarian are alike
charmed with Its crisp taste and the deli-
cate flavor of grape sugar, and the care-
ful housewife is attracted by the fact
that there are fourteen portions in a 15-
cent package. Â¦ V

THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PICNIC TO BE GIVEN BY THEIR

The club has appointed Fred T. Elsey,
Louis Lefevre, Milo Hlckox.P. H. Rosen-
Professional bouts were Introduced orig
inally for purely financial reasons. The
club was in need of money and the re
ceipts from these monthly contests were
of material gain. Now conditions are on
such an excellent footing that the direc
tors feel. they can abolish professionalism
and return to strictly amateur affairs.
' The board and the club members were
very much disgusted 'with the "fluke" last
month; when "Spider" Welch and Tommy
Gilfeather refused to fight because they
were not satisfied with the house re
ceipts. This action haa in large measure
contributed to the opposition to profes
sionalism- that has been aroused.
The club has arranged a match between
Rufe Turner and Herrera for June 3 or
thereabouts. That this will be the last
professional engagement made by the di
rectors is probable, as immediate s.teps
will be taken for a final decision.
Although no decisive vote was taken,
the directors announced that the club
members would immediately be given op
portunity to express their opinion. Little
dcubt is expressed that the members will
agree with their directors.,
Professional boxers are to be eliminated
from the Reliance Club. The ring events
in the near future will be confined to ex
hibitions by strictly amateur talent. Such
was the sentiment unanimously expressed
by the board of directors at a meeting last
night, when the matter was very thor
oughly canvassed. â¢ â¢

The members of the Olympic Athletic
Club entertained, the. Burlingame Country
Club men last night in their Post-street
gymnasium. The entertainment was in
the nature of a boxing tournament. It
was of the highest class and replete with
npvelties. The attendance was both large
and representative, including many prom
inent members of both organizations.
The first surprise was the appearance of
Bob Fitzsimmons in the ring in a bout
with Tom Wiison, his sparring partner.
It was far from being the stereotyped ex
hibition. The size of: the gloves alone
prevented Ftiz from doing terrible execu
tion There were a lot of knockdowns
seme' genuine and some only feigned.
Twice Fitz's left glove traveled a distance
o* four Inches and landed with such foi je
as to send Wilson down. Fitz-was as
full of fun as a schoolboy and showed all
his wonderful agility and cleverness with
the 'gloves. At the end of the third round
each landed make-believe knockout
nunches and went/ to the mat. In response
to insistent calls for a speech Fitz said:
"Gentlemen, I thank you for the
warmth of your reception and .the sin
cerity of your applause. It tells me you
are all my friends. 1 I have, come 3000 miles
to assist Mr. Jeffries in making a match.
My forfeit is up and Mr. Jeffries should
put up his. I can assure you I am confi
dent of winning the championship and will
do my best to do so." -
Four youthful boxers were turned loose,
blindfolded, in the ring at one time. This
was the comedy touch which relieved the
strenuous aspect of the remainder of the
card Their efforts to locate one another
drove the spectators into convulsions of
laughter. â¢ _ â ' â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢'
Heavy-weight Sam Berger scored a
clean victory over Andy Gallagher. ~ The
latter's seconds threw up the sponge in
the third round to save him unnecessary
punishment. The fight was full of hard
hitting on both sides. .
Barney Driscoll was awarded the" deci
sion over Monte Attell after four rounds
marked more for earnestness than for
brilliancy. Driscoll had the lead over At
tell for three rounds, scoring one clean
knockdown. Attell outstayed his oppo
nent, having all the better of the fourth
round. The judges disagreed and Referee
Williamson cast the deciding vote.
E. Anstett made a punching bag of -M.
F. Frayne for four rounds. Gameness was
the chief quality possessed -by the latter.
J. M. Collins was awarded the decision
on points in a. bout with- Fred Landers.

would end in an unpleasant scene. -. An
official of: the club tried to stop Harry

SUMMARY.
SACRAMENTO, May 14.-Slagle was the
whole show to-day, as he shut out the
Senators and allowed only one scratch
hit, made in the ninth inning by Hulen,
who drove a stiff one at Raymer and beat
his throw to first. Thomas pitched good
ball and was accorded errorless support,
but his outfield was so slow on its feet
that ordinary flies that should have been
captured were turned into two and thrÂ»*
baggers. The score:
Holds the Senators Down to One
Scratch Hit.

inside of a man, especially when that
man is a bon vivant, and he was quick to
perceive the value of the advice.
HERMANN OELRICHS has joined
the ranks of equestrians. The
well-known millionaire sports
man was advised that the out-
ter of Crossways, Burllngame, his Ken
tucky-bred saddle mare Diana. She is a
deep rich brown in color, stands fifteen
hands two inches in height and is up to
carrying . a man of. greater weight than
her new owner.
This mare was shown in the ring at the
Tanforan horse show and was greatly ad
mired. She has all the gaits peculiar to
the single-footer and is as gentle as can
be. At present she is as sleek as a mole,
but high in flesh from lack of work.
. Mr. Carolan took so deep an interest in
Jds polo and race ponies and in his hunt
ers that he made but little use of this
mare.
Mr. Oelrichs has not let his friends into

not expected he will don the scarlet coat

something comfortable, in keeping with
his ideas on correct dress.

The. crowd was unusually large and all
the seats were filled. It was the largest
"Wednesday crowd , seen yet, and it was
also a quiet crowd, resembling a Sunday
school class more than a gang of base
ball rooters. The score:
, The grounds were in better condition
than at any other time this season, and
the game was . a little faster than the
ordinary kind that they bring off in Oak
land. Francks gave a brilliant. exhibition
at short. He accepted nine hard chances
without a.- single error. Mohler was the
only Oakland baby to make a misplay,
and as it was not serious he was par
doned.
Oakland scored in, the second on a pair
of clean singles and a sacrifice hit. They
got two more in the fifth, aided by two
bases on balls, a hit by Lohman. and
Nordyke's error of McNichols' throw to
first. Two more came In during the
seventh and ninth on a two-bagger by
Dunlevy, two clever sacrifices, a single
and Leahy's error.
Chlmmie der Whale passed out the
goods for Hank, and his offerings were
never too mysterious for Oakland to
solve. Chimmie's support was not gilt
edged, and , errors figured conspicuously
in letting two of Ewmg's stars trip over
the rubber. On "the other hand, if the
Ponies wanted a run they were com
pelled to work overtime, for errors never
came to their assistance; and for all their
work they only accumulated 1 point,
while Oakland hammered out 5.
The seventh was the only round to pro
duce a Pony run. The ever-reliable Nor
dyke auspiciously opened it with a beau
tiful swat to deep center field. Holly drew
,a pass and McNichols flew out to Mc-
Cr,eedie, Dyke scoring on the throw. He
Just barely scored, and many were of the
opinion that he was. a dead one. That
was all the locals got, and the crowd re
marked they were fortunate, which was
an appropriate remark.
The Ponies never had a chance to wal
lop Hodson yesterday at the Oakland
grounds. The little chap was there with
chimes, and the Harris aggregation could
not make the bells ring, either. Oakland
put up its usual high art game in the
field, and at the bat they landed some.
It was not a particularly brilliant affair,
but it was enough to show that Ewing
had it on the Ponies all the time.

The acid poisons that produce rheumatic pains form in the blood, and are

The case then went over until next Sat
uraay. In the meantime damning evi
dence on other charges of extortion is be
fcmning to. accumulate against Levings.
Aftei the accused policeman left Judge
slogan's court he walked into the corri
at-r. where he engaged in a disgraceful
Wordy war with Attorney Kelly, during
whicji Kelly made the staement that Lev
â¢ s ? n would have to answer other charseÂ«=
ct attempted extortion. V
At this juncture Judge Mogan asked if
Ltvings mentioned the name of any par
ticular Judge. The witness replied, "No.
ho did not."
An adjournment was then taken until 2
o'clock in the afternoon, at which time
August Augenblick Mas called to the
Kand. Augenblick is a liquor dealer, and
Crothers was employed by him at the
lime of his arrest. Augenblick testified
that Livings called upon him and tried
to get him to induce Mrs. Darling to pay
to him the sum of $150 to drop the case.
Au^enWick. stated that Levings was -will
teÂ£ to reduce the charge to petty larceny
ii Mrs. Daring would put up 5150. Levings
said a portion of the money was to go to
the Judge.
John A. Douglass, a clerk in General
Salomon's law- office, was next called as
a witness. He in substance substantiated
The Ptcries tcld by Klemmer and Mrs.
Darling. Douglass testified that he was
behind a glass door in Mrs. Darling's
house when Levings made the proposi
tion to "square" the case for 1150.
C0BE0B0SATIVE TESTIMONY.
If Levings had been trying to extort
money from Mrs. Darling or anybody
else," explained Chief Wittman, "I knew
inat the facts would come out at the
trial, so I told Levings distinctly that I
would insist on a vigorous prosecution of
iht case."
Chief Wittman further testified that
when Levings told him of what occurred
at Mrs. Darling's house he informed Lev
ings that he would insist upon a vigorous
1". rot-ecu tion of the case, and. that if there
~tt a Job of any kind in it it would come
out In court. Chief Wittman also stated
mat Levings was detailed on the case by
Lieutenant Birdsall.
When the case of Crothers was called
lor further prosecution yesterday morning
Chief of Police Wittman testified that at
the time Levirgs made the arrest he was
not acting under his (Wittman's) orders,
and -that Levings visited Mrs. Darling's
house entirely on his own responsibility.
\\ lUman said that he knew nothing about
l.e-Anss' visits to Mrs. Darling until Lev
ings called him out of the meeting of the
Police Commissioners and told him that
ilrs. Darling and her friends were trying
to job him.
Policeman L. L. ~ Levings, accused of
trying to extort money from Mrs. C. E.
barling to "square" the case of J. E.
Croihcrs, charged with having stolen a
ease of cigars from M. A. Gunst & Co.,
had an unpleasant time of it yesterday
before Judge Moxan.
Mrs. Darliug Gives Details of
Alleged Attempted
Extortion.
"Well, what have you done, Mr. Levings?'.' I
then said. "I see you booked - the boy for
grand larceny," and he said, "What could I
do â did I not explain to you he would have to
plead guilty to petty . larceny?" He said^he
had fixed and arranged everything with the
Judge, but that I had nearly upset his plans
and that if I weren't careful I would upset all
his plans. I said I had nothing to do with
any lawyers going down to see the boy. I
then said, "Now to the point." I said, "I've
got this money," looking him squarely in the
face, but can't you do it for $100? These peo
ple are very poor," and he said, "No"; that
ho had already fixed it with the Judge, which
would cost $50, and that It was worth his
position or risking his position If this was
found out, and -that he would not give up his
position for over $1500, and that Wittman had
already begun to get suspicious because he had
not charged the boy. Then I said, : "W r ho is
the Judge?" and he said, "Don't ask me any
names. All you have to do is to give me the
money and the case will come ud to-morrow
and the boy will be serving his time, six
months, to-morrew at 11 o'clock." I said,
"What guarantee have I If I give you $150
and the boy does not set off with petty lar
ceny.and gets ten years instead?" I then said
I would go out and get the money. Before he
could reply he stood up and sot nervous and
confused and said to me, "Wlmt have you pot
in there? I Bee a shadow of a head on the
door." and at that Douglass and Klemmer
stepped in, and Mr. Klemmer said to me,
"No, you won't give him one nickel. I am
that boy's friend and am putting up the money
for him and I don't propose to see you black
mailed." It looked as though there was going
to be trouble and so I stepped back and heard
no more of the conversation until I heard Mr.
Lev-ings say. "Good night, Mrs. Darling," In
a very sarcastic manner.
During- one of my conversations with Lev
ings he told me he had a "pull" with" the
Chief and that he was the Chief's right-hand
man, and told me he had originally been a
newspaper man. On Monday evening at my
house he wrote his address on an envelope,
which I herewith hand you (and which Is
hereto attached), stating when I had the
money to call him up at that address. I make
this statement freely and voluntarily, without
ahy promise whatsoever, and declare the same
to be the truth word for" word Just as the
occurrences above mentioned took place.

the last two years,' was read. â¢
A. Li. Cauvel of Walla Walla, F. W:
Matteson of Stockton Â¦ and H. Way of
Eureka were :. appointed; a committee to
prepare a fraternal greeting to be for
warded to the Grand Lodge of Odd Fel
lows, now in session in this city.
There was a prolonged discussion of the
proposition to admit the Companions of
the Forest to the privileges of the en
dowment feature of 'â¢ the order. It was
â¢argued that the mortality among women
ls.no greater than among men and that
therefore the women were not greater
risks. After a full consideration of the
matter the proposition to allow lady com
panions to participate in the fund was
carried by a vote of 142 to 8.
At noon the Orand. Court officers and
"delegates were escorted to the Mint steps,
where they were photographed in a group.
At the afternoon session the proposition
to abolish the office of permanent secre
tary, as at present. existing, and make the
office elective, was discussed and it was
fecided not to make a change.
By a vote of the High Court the sum of
$100 was donated to the fund, for the Mar
tinique sufferers and the permanent sec
retary, John Falconer, was instructed to
send a circular letter to each court in the
Pacific Court Jurisdictibn requesting do
nations to that fund.
In the i evening the High Court officers
gave instructions in the initiatory and
secret work to the delegates.
- To-day the. officers for the ensuing term
will be chosen and in the evening there
will be a banquet in the A. O. F. building.
we waited a considerable lejigth of time,
when the bell rang at about 8:30 or 8:45 and
Officer Levlngs came.
I came out to receive him.' My- Jap opened
the door and took him in the parlor. I had
arrangements made with Klemmer and Doug
lass that they should stand behind the door
and listen to every word- said. They could
hear distinctly every word said. I said first..
LEVINGS IS CONFRONTED.
Mr. Klemmer overheard this conversation
word for v. r ord, as I wut him where he could
hear It, as I wanted a witns-sa. I am not sure
whether Mr. Au*tenbllck listened or not. On
Tuesday, the following day, Levlngg phoned
me about 1 or 2 o'clock that the boy had been
charged, and said, "Are you ready and are ail
arrangements madei because I- don't want, to
riÂ»k cominjc up there?" I. said, "Yes; if you
mean business and are sincere I'm ready for
you." He said he would be here in the even
ing. In the meantime Mr. Augenblick had
seen General Salomon and Mr.' Douglass and
sent them to see me. The young man Klem
mer brought .tthem up to my .house .after they
had Interviewed fin nrlaoncr. Mr. - Klemmer,
Mr. Autrenblick and the prisoner had told Mr.
Douglais and General Salomon about the prop
osition of money made by Officer Levlnics . to
me. They came up h*re apd had an hour's
Interview with me. Â¦ I repeated to them word
for word the conversation I had with Officer
livings relative to the money, and they aeked
me if I had a witness. Mr. Klemmer spoke
up and said, "Yes; I heard every word of it â
every word of it." I raid, "He Is to be heri?
to-night (Tuesday), as he call* it 'for the
dough,' and it remains to be seen whether he
calls for It or not." They then told me he had
charred the boy with grand larceny Instead
of petty larceny, as he had promised; and I
sa.14 that he could not be charged with petty
larceny as long aÂ» the boy would not plead
pulltv. but that he had agreed to fix It with
tha .Tud*<Â» to reduce the charge to retty I lar
Â«-<â¢-- â¢ â¢Â«?.?*â¢â¢ next tr'il of the. ess*. Then Gen
eral Salomon said that I must have witneRse3
here this night when I tender him the money,
and be agreed to have Douglass and Klemmer
i.v.t. 'jm.ii incy left. <. Mr. . Douglass then re
turned In the evening at' about 7 M0. 'Mr.
Klemmer cams in a f*w minutes afterward.
I then went to Mr. Augenblick, the
boy's employer, and Stated, exactly to
him what the officer had stated to
me. The reason I did this was that
Mr. Augenblick had given the boy a very good
reputation and was willing to take him back.
Mr. Augenblick accompanied me overt to Mr.
Gunst's place on Kearny street, where I in
terviewed him and his partner, who treated
me very nicely. . I pleaded for the boy'Â« moth
er's sake and not for the boy, and told them
of their poverty, etc. I did not mention to
Mr. Gunst or his partner any conversation had
with Mr. Livings, but did repeat the entire
conversation relative to the 'money proposi
tion had with the officer to Mr. Augenblick.
He told me in response not to make any prom
l&es; that .he would come up in the evening
and see me. and asked me what time the
officer would be there. I told him. I then
came home. Mr. Augenblick called first .that
evening. My Jap opened the door at about ten
minutes before 8 (Monday). Both Mr. Klem
mer and Mr. Augenblick were in the dining
room when Officer Levings cameâ at about
8:30. Before Mr. Levings came Mr. Augen
blick said to me that I should have the officer
state the price that he wanted to "fix" .the
case, and I said, "Yes. I. will do that." Mr.
Kletnmer was- present at the time. Then the
officer came and I met him In the conversa
tion hall. He sat there, *nd I said, "Well,
what have you done?" He said. "1 have every
thing arranged, and if you have the 'dough'
I can 'fix* it, but if you have any one Inter
fere, such as shyster lawyers, and get the boy
not to plead guilty, I'll wipe my hands of
it, as Chief Wittman would begin to get sus
picious, as the boy should have been charged
before this." I said to him: "What is the
limit of ths money required?' And he ea.li!
that not one ntckel less than $150 would do, as
he had to "fix" the Judge. He further said:
"I will charge the boy In the morning-, as
there is no time to be lost, a3 things would
begin to look auspicious." I said: "I will
hear frcm his Jeople to-morrow (Tuesday) and
will have the money for you,' and asked him
what time he would be were. He said he
could not come in the day, but would come
the same time to-morrow evening (Tuesday).
He said: "Now, leave the rest to me; don't
interfere with It; yofl make the boy plead
guilty tcr> petty larceny and have the 'dough'
here to-morrow, and J'll have the boy in the
County Jail to-morrow by 12, serving his
time." I said, "All right," and he left.
WANTED THE "DOUGH."
He asked rae to send this to his aunt and
that he could square the case for $50. I ' sent
the telegram and also phoned and also "sent
a letter with a special delivery stamp, which
the boy wrote. After leaving the boy Officer
Levings came over and escorted me down
stairs (he was not present at the time I had
the Interview with the boy in the prison), and
he said, "Well, he's guilty, all right." I said
"I don't know about that: I am going to do
all I can for him, for the sake of his mother "
He then said to me: ."If he will only have
sense enough to plead guilty to petty larceny
(as he has been in trouble before) It could
be 'fixed' for very little, ana he would only
have to serve six months, less two for good
behavior, in the County Jail, instead of ten
or twelve years across the bay." I said:
"What do you mean by 'fixed' " ? He said
that for a. very little money, for a very lit
tle consideration, that he had the pull and
influence, that he could fix it by charging him
with petty larceny. I then said: "How much
will it take?" And he said: "Find out how
much you can get." I said I would think
it over and let him know. He told me he
could not tell how much It, would be to "fix"
the case. He said: "I can't talk to you
down here, but I will come up to tee you;
what time will you. be home this evening
(Monday)?" I said I would be home any time
and that he could come up. and that I would
then tell him definitely what I could do, as I
intended to leave no stone unturned to help
tha boy. Iasked htm if he would phone me,
and he said It was best not' to; that he would
be up there that night. 1 lert Him at the Hall
of Justice about 1 o'clock.
In addition to locating and incorporat

Â¦At Panama they secured the services of
Roderick McKinnon, an 'expert â¢ miner,
who wÂ«^s the oflly survivor of another
less fortunate expedition. Taking , with
them a tiumber of natives as guides and
laborers, the three white men covered on
their trip a great stretch of practically
unexplored territory.
Hornlein states that there is a great
deal of gold in the country, but that the
facilities for mining are meager and in
adequate. To conduct a paying business,
he says, It is necessary to invest a .large
amount of capital. The backers of the
enterprise, who wish to withhold their
identity from the. public for the present,
have expressed themselves as satisfied
with Â¦ the ..results ; which have been at
tained by. the young men, and have ar
ranged to finance the. scheme. Machinery
and other- necessary equipments will be
purchased immediately and shipped to
Nicaragua where. Nicol, who remained
behind, will receive and set up the ap
paratus. Active work on the mines will
not be commenced until November on ac
count of the difficulties incident to the
rainy season.
Hornlein, in company. with J. M. Nicol.
left this city last January ' for Central
America iri the interests of a number of
local capitalists. It has long been known
that there are extensive gold deposits in
Nicaragua, and those- interested "in thq
present enterprise determined to conduct
an exhaustive research for some rich "gold
district which would be easily accessible;
Hornlein and- Nicol were supplied -with
plenty of capital and directed to spare
neither trouble or expense in attaining
the end desired. .; Â¦-â¢ â¢
Alvin E. Hornleln, deputy clerk of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
This charge to the jury knocked tlie
I rops completely from under Ihe defense,
and the jury, after an absence of fifteen
minutes, returned to the courtroom with
a verdict of guilty as charged and a unan
imous recommendation to the mercy o*
the court, Duffy being a respectable look
ing young fellow.
The case was conducted for the Govern
ment by United States Attorney. Marshall
B. Woodworth and Third Assistant United
States Attorney Ben I* McKinley. The evl
uence showcl that Mr Foo arrived on the
Coptic 011 July sr> of last year In transit to
-the City of Jlsxico. His application to
pass i!iiviii|Mi. ihif. country was denieJ en
August 1 of the same year and he was
placed by the steamship company in the
detention shed, pending appeals and fur-,
ther proceedings. On January 30 of this
year an application was filed on his behal"
on the ground that Ma Foo was a native
of the United States. On the same date
Ma Foo was delivered to John Duffy by
M. S. Blackburn, Government watchman,
to be placed by Duffy In the custody of
the United States Marshal. Duffy took
Ma Foo in his express wagon to a photo
graph gallery on Kearny street and had
him photographed. Shortly afterward he
brought to the Marshal's office not Ma
Foo, but an old and decrepid Chinaman
who gave that name. The fraud was dis
covered by Deputy Marshal George H.
Kurnham, who happened to be in the pho
tograph gallery when the real Ma Foo
was brought in. "When Burnham found
the false Ma ' Foo in the Marshal's
office he was thunderstruck and immedi
ately reported the facts to United States
Attorney "Woodworth.
Duffy was ordered to appear for sen
tence on Friday morning at 10 o'clock.
Judge de Haven began by saying that
the presumption in the case of a China
man coming* from Hongkong to the United
States was that he was a subject of the
Chinese empire and not entitled to land '
in this country, and the burden of proof,
was upon the Chinese person to show that
he had a right to land. The Jury should
nut be governed by thej allegations of the
applicant in his petition for the writ of
habeas corpus.
The fact that the applicant" alleged that
he was a citizen of the United States
should not raise any presumption . what
ever that such was the fact. With regard
to the further contention of Duffy's coun
sel, Bert Schlesinger, that there could not
be any aiding and abetting the escape of
Ma> Foo because he was taken from the
detention shed at the Mail dock instead of
from the steamer Coptic, which brought
him here, Judge de Haven instructed the
jurv that Ma Foo had not been landed In
the United States so long as he remained
in the custody of the company owning the
sicamship which brought him to this port.
If. be had been detained in the detention
shed awaiting the determination of his
right to pass through this country in
transit or to remain here as a native-born
American, he had not been landed v/ithln
the ltftan'n" of the law.
The law defining the status of a Chi
nfse person seeking: admission to .the
United States was laid down tersely' and
clearly yesterday by United States Dis
trict Judge de;Haven when delivering his
tharfie ;o the jury in. the case of the
United States of America against John
Duffy, indicted for aiding and abetting in
ths Illegal landing of Ma Foo, a Chinese
person.

ThÂ« Harbor Commissioners at their regular
meeting held yesterday afternoon decided to
construct a drydock at an expense of $200,000
and ordered the chief engineer to prepare
FpeclBcatlons and' advertise for bids. The dock,
if built, will probably be located at th<Â» end
â¢if Center street. The San Francisco Ballast
Company want a location at the foot of Powell
street for ballast bunkers with a capacity of
1000 tons. The engineer said that it- would
cost $C500 to construct a suitable foundation
and suggested that if the request was granted
the owners be required to build and maintain
the foundation. The matter was laid over for
further consideration. . . . .
Will Build Drydbck.
George Bender of Bender Brothers, Third and
Berry streets, was arrested yesterday . at the
Instance of the Board of Public Works on the
charge of obstructing the streets. The Benders
rent their office premises from the Harbor Com
mithioner?. They have occupied and paid rent
for their present location for more than seven
t<*en years. The city claims 100 feet of the
prrmises rented by the Harbor Commissioners,
and as Bender refused to vacate until so or
dered by his landlord, the State, the city had
him arrested. After being balled out Bender
appeared before ; the Harbor Commissioners,
who promised their assistance In fighting or
compromising thÂ« case. Bender informed the
board that his arrest was the result of personal
malice. The matter will come before Judge
CabaniES to-day.

CHICAG6. May 14. â Yesterday's bulls at the
opening of the wheat pit to-day showed that
they had forgotten all about yesterday's bull
ish Government report. The cables showed no
response to our strengyi, and above all the
weather was very favorable. Bains fell copi
ously In Kansas and Nebraska, and the spring
wheat country in the Northwest was clearing.
A local statistician made a report Indicating
a yield of 410,000,000 bushels, quite at vari
ance with the Government estimate. ThÂ»se
factors started July a Ehade to %cq Vic lower
at 76%c to 76c, and depressed it early to 75%
<g/75-7ic. Corn strength and reports of good cash"
business brought a good j reaction and prices
for a time held firm near last night's close
Trade, however, was light, the outside specu
lator was not in the market, and there was
some fair selling by yesterday's buyers. Part
of the reaction was due to short covering
Gradually prices slipped back. The close was
weak, July %c lower at 75 1 ,4@75%c.
Corn was the leader of the pits In the matter
of strength. Cash business was good, St. Louis
bought here, and cables were firm. July
closed firm, %c up, at 63%c.
Oats were influenced by .selling by the lead
ing bull operators. July closed weak: %Â®%c
lower, at 36%@37c- . â¢". â¢ 7.1-ffr^r:
The strength in . provisions â¢was that of re
newed buying and support by. packers', started
by a strong hog market at the yards. July
pork closed 12%cup; lard and ribs each 10c
higher. â¢ .

The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢'Last week's collapse of certain speculative
bubbles has materially improved the situation
on the Stock Exchange. It has induced a clossr
scrutiny cf collateral on part of the banks,
lorced considerab'.p wholesome liquidation and
aSorded a desirable- and much needed check
to reckless wildcat speculation. The creation
of new securities having scarcely present or
prospective value of any sort was going on at
a race that threatened dangc-r to the entire
financial community; and serious results were
unavoidable unless such manipulators were
premptiy crushed. The only power capable of
dealing v.-ith these forces was the banks; and
to them must be given the credit for putting
ou the brakes judiciously at the time of emer
gency. The remedy was uncomfortable fer
ihose who had ignore;! the dictates -of common
1 rudence. but \he experience has, 'been bene
ficial to the large majority of interests. Hence
lorth we are likely to witness more caution re
garding shadowy enterprises.
"Whil<? there has bwn more or less irres
uiariiy in the stock market since the above
events, due chiefiy to uncertainty concerning
the money situation and the coal strike, still
the market exhibited good rallying powers after
all de-clines. Underneath all visible Influence?
there is a confidence among the holders of good
railroad stocks which effectively prevents any
material declines and is the basis of upward
manipulations at every opportunity. Holders
of such securities will not sell even at prestnt
high prices; their reasons plainly being the ex
traordinary continuance of good earnings and
the feeling- that the concentration movement
among the railways will in some occult man
nor benefit their particular property. While
this substantial form of optimism governs the
groat mass cf stockholders, it is useless to ex
pect any general reaction in the stock mar
kut. We are quite likely to see more frequent
fci-oRks as a result of speculative excesses, but
no general liquidation or selling* of good rail
road s-tocks is possible until something hap
;xtj3 to modify or destroy this underlying op
timistic spirit.
"At present the governing factors in the sit
uation are these, in their respective order â the
\ioney market, the crop outlook, the railroad
tuation. the iron trade and business condi
cnr. The monetary situation is not entirely
free from concern. Bank reserve* are low,
lnans gieatly expanded and the development o"
other weak spots during the summer would
cause no surprise. Funds must soon return
' more freely froni the interior, which, in con
nection with forced contraction of loans, would
strengthen reserves. Money, however. Is hard
ly likely to remain as easy as at one time ex-
IKCteo.. for considerable gold exports seem in
evttable. ov.-ing to American investments
abroad and to less favorable trade balances, re-
M:it;ngT from diminished exports and increasing
iir.iorts. As to the crop outlook, there la noth
ing very positive in either direction. Favor
able rair.s have fallen in large sections of the
Â¦\\'tst. and should the yield be up to an aver
agi we may expect no cessation of present trade
ftcCMty in the West. . Our railroads are still
iraking sjilendid returns and generally show
ing increases about 10 to 12 per cent ahead of
the large figures of last year. This is the most
convincing evidence of continued general pros
perity. Still, the main source of strength of
the better class of railroad stocks is the fact
that imrK)rtnnt merger plans are under consid
eration; and. though the Northern Securities
case has somevi hat delayed such schemes, their
final consummation is ultimately looked for.
Th<? iron trade continues taxed to the utmost,
and the furnaces hold orders that will keep
them fully employed to the end of the year.
As for the general trade outlook, that is en
couraging. Here and there reactionary symp
toms are developing. hi?h prices for raw mate
rials and labor having materially increased
cost of production until a point has been
reached where profits are receding and con
svmr>tion is being sensibly checked. There is
no sipn of general reaction in sijrht. but that
the indications of a turn in the tide are mul
tiplying must not be ignored.
'"In brief, we have a number of influences in
favor if higher prices such as cited above; on
th3 othÂ«Â»r hand, unfavorable developments in
[;he money or crop situation would precipitate
Fharp reactions and quickly subdue Jhe present
bullish undertone. Opportunities for quick
turns will be plentiful, but the only safe course
will be to sell on pronounced rallies and buy
only on decided breaks."

Strawberries showed little change. Receipts
were large and the threatening weather in the
morning put a check on the demand. Goose
berries are mostly small and sell slowly.
Only strictly choice offerings of Cherries
commanded the top quotation. There is a lot
of small stock coming, which tends to weaken
the market.' Another consignment of Apricots

Stocks of fruit are now so small that the
quotations, except for Prunei, are largely nom
inal. Mail advices from New York say:
"There is . a better movement and feeling in
raisins with loose 3-crown grade held at from
6%c- to 6%c. Stocks are- said *to 'be concen
trated in, few hands. California seeded is
about" steady with business reported In small

holders, however, ask up to 8%c for small lots.
Choice Is available at from 8c to S%c accord

ers 7%c to 7%c is quoted. The movement is
light. In prunes the feeling is quiet and shows
easiness except on 4,0-50s in new Santa Claras.
There are 'sellers, however, at C%c, but most
holders ask %c higher. Old fruit is pressing
on the. market and. prices are irregular. Late
reports from the coast as to damage to the new
crop are taken with reserve here. . Little or no

No more Eastern Poultry came in and the
receipts of California were light. Good-sized
young stock was, in demand at unchanged
prices, but the market was dull for most de
scriptions. There are too many small Broilers
coming in and they are hard to sell, even at the
low figures. . * .
There were no changes in Game. Twelve

Stocks were idle but firm to-day, awaiting
the result of the peace conference in South
Africa. The American department was very
quiet. London at present is quite' apathetic,
in view of the high level of prices, and would
buy only on a considerable drop in quotations.
Union Pacific advanced sharply on buying by
the. Gates interests. Eight dollars a share is
given freÂ°ly for a double option to the end of
August, rrhe general list improved reluctantly
and the upward trend stopped when New York
orders ceased. Call money rates ran up to 2%
on settlement demands.

The Business Outlook.
but the firmness of the market was passive
and had no positive element in so far as could
be perceived. The trading fell near to the
p^int of stagnation and the day's total tran
sactions were smaller than for many months.
Union Pacific made some show of strength -and
was far in the lead cf all other stocks in point
of activity. Gossip was in circulation of an
Intended increase in the dividend rate on the
stock. Action on the dividend Is not expected
until July and it Is natural to suppose that
the course of the winter wheat and corn crops
between now and then will have a bearing on
the dividend action. The course of these crops
is Just now the subject of greatest uncertainty
in speculative circles and this uncertainty was
a large influence in the speculative halt in the
stock market which took place tb-day. "An
other cause was the anthracite miners' con
vention, which was in session at Hazleton to
decide whether to make the conditional strike
of the miners permanent. No light was thrown
on this question before the- close of the day,
but the coal stocks shared generally in the
firmness of the market. Another feature of the
day was the wide recoveries scored by some of
the high-priced stocks, which fell violently un
der the liquidation Monday. There were other
high-priced stocks in the inactive list which
sold to-day at wide decl'nes from the previous
sales. The money market was much quieter
to-day and there was no seeming difficulty in
obtaining call loans at 6 per cent or ' under.
The process pt borrowing in foreign money
markets was continued to-day, as. indicated
by the further decline in the sterling exchange
rate. The completion of some large syndicate
transactions and bond subscriptions which have
been In progress recently took part in re
lieving the moapv market and lightening the
pressure to tell stocks. The sub-treasury re
quirements en the money market are much leas
than last week, partly owing to increased pen
sion payments.
Bonds were dull but firm. Total sales, par
value. $3,270,000.
United States 3s declined % per cent on the
last call.

_ Every grocer of prominence In this

hied himself to Schuetzen Park to attend
the thirty-first annual' picnic of the Re
tail Grocers' Association. The men who
deal in dry and wet goods forgot their
business ' cares for. the day and joined in
the merrymaking/ It was an ideal day
and thousands of" people took advantage
of the weather to attend the outing.
Every train bore its share or pleasure
seekers, and by ' noon- the park was
crowded with picnickers.
A band rendered popular dance music,
and the pavilion was crowded the entire
day with devotees of the light fantastic.
There were games of every kind and
prizes for everybody. The races were
highly exciting, and enough goods to

Horace G. Platt is still' president of the
Geary-street road, and will undoubtedly
remain in office until the franchise ex
pires next year. It is generally believed
that the company will apply for a new
franchise, and that it will make an offer
of $75,000 for an additional twenty-five
years' franchise.
AH the officers of the United Railroads
have resigned from the Geary-street
line. In the future Richard Derby will
act as secretary, and E. C. Wright as
treasurer of the company. George A.
Grimes, formerly with the Sutter-street
line, has been made superintendent of
the Geary-street road, his appointment
going into effect to-day. , . â¢ i
The stockholders of the company held
a meeting yesterday afternoon in the of
fices of the Pacific Improvement Com
pany, and it was decided to immediately
make some changes. Most of the Geary
street Railway stock is at present held
by the Pacific Improvement Company,
and for motives of economy the street
car company and the Pacific Improve
ment Company will occupy the same of
fices. -
The Geary-street Railway Company will
from to-day operate its road separately
and will be no longer connected with the
United Railroads of San Francisco.
The arrangements went like clockwork
yesterday. About 3:30 p. m. five hack's
for the Harriman party drove into the
Palace Hotel courtyard. The carriages
were soon filled by Mr. Harriman, his
family and invited guests; and away they
went, without a moment's delay.
Assistant President Julius Kruttschnitt
â¢will accompany the party, and at each
division the superintendent of the district
will meet the train and remain with it un
til it Is out of his territory. Superintend
ent W. S. Palmer with his private car
will go with the party as far as Sacra
mento; from there to Dunsmuir Superin
tendent R. J. Laws will be responsible
for the party, and to Portland Superin
tendent L. R. Fields wiJl be on the train.
President Harriman does not believe in
planning things ahead of time â he aclsÂ»
on the impulse of the moment Yester
day morni:ig- he decided that he would
leave at 4 in the afternoon. The word
was given to Superintendent -of Transpor
tation Richardson, and the special train
bearing the president and his select
party pulled out of the Oakland mole on
exact time.
President E. H. Harriman of the South
ern Pacific Company left this city yes
terday afternoon at 4 o'clock. He will
cpend several hours in Stockton to-day,
and then journey to Sacramento. He will
leave the Capital City late to-morrow
e\fning and go from there to Portland.
From this city on his Itinerary has not
been arranged. Traffic Director J. C.
Etubbs will meet him at Ogden and
travel with the party at- far as Chicago.

tried to force- him to give the name of
the ladies who were with 'him. when 'he
bumped the cur. Larzalere ; declined
whereupon Pistolesi arose and -Scanned

a dismissal of his client on the ground
that-Case killed the animal and not Lar

rHEDIlICK'S APPEAL STAYS
EXECUTION" OF THE ORDER
When the case was called the room was
crowded with "Hillites" and "Townltes."
The former occupied the Jury box and
Surroundings, while the rabble went way
back and sat down on benches. Young
men with .varl-colored neck-cloths . or
stocks and hair parted to a nicety chap
eroned the. "Hillites," who were repre
sented in the presence of Rev. Mr. Wil
son, Mrs. Starkeeler, Mrs. Kilgarlff. Mrs.
Hickman, Miss Maud Miller, Miss Marian
Harrison, Miss Zelda Tiffany, Mrs. Ber
ry, Miss Grace Miller, Miss Anna Sparry,
Mrs. Mason, the Misses Mason, Mrs. Cap
tain Draper and the latter's bull pup
"Sapho." Mr.' Kilgariff thought it was
a society function, so he came in full
dress. "Billy" Harrison laughed ; so
heartily at one of Prosecuting Attorney
Pistolesi's sallies that he took a tack
somersault out of the jury box mussing
his hair.
Defendant Larzalere was late in court.
He had been playing ping-pong and for
got the hour set for the trial. Although
ne possesses an "automobile face," no
one would accuse him of being the "mur
derer" whom the Prosecuting Attorney
tried to make- him. appear, to be. Judge
Langhorne defended .Larzalere and he
helped on the fun by stirring up City
Attorney Pistolesi with caustic repartee:
Whenever counsel made strenuous ob
jection to a- auestion asked witness. -the
court would settle the matter by judicial
ly saying "cut it out.". The question being
"cut out," the attorneys would start over
again.
Dr. E. E. Case, the prosecuting witness,
is poundmaster, dentist," land agent, sec
retary of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, public executioner
and general Poo Bah of Sausalito. He
created consternation during the trial by
saying he saw the eminent jurist. Jus-
â¢ putated the tail of a yellow dog

amusement, for the residents who crowd

Justice J. S. Bellrude drives the town
