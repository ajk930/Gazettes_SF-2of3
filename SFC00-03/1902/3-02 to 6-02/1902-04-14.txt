: NEW YORK, April 13.â The Times has
this from London: It appears certain,
says -.the - Paris correspondent of the
Times, that the agitation in Belgium was
designed 1 to coincide ' with -an attempt on
the life of King Leopold at Biarritz. f For
tunately,. says the correspondent.' the plot
was frustrated on account of the fact that
his Majestey returned to Brussels , earlier,
than was expected in^order to reinforce

The determination" to. name O. A. Hale

The comparatively brief duration of the

an indication that the Boer leaders found
BOERS RESTING "ON ARMS.
."I am In a positfon to assert that in
forira*.i:n cf a deflr.lte character announc
ing a general surrender of the Boers has
been received here from the War Office,
but for some reason, probably because it
was premature, the news was stopped a
few hour3 after it was received to prevent
further circulation."
"Quite a . sensation has been caused by
a statement that official information has
been received by officers of the Dover
garrison that the Boers had surrendered
and that the war had ceased. Some effort
was made to officially contradict this
statement, but Inquiries I made to-day
leave no room whatever to doubt that In
formation from the War Office of a most
gratifying character did leak out to the
general commanding the southeastern
district, whose headquarters is at Dover.
The Herald's Dover correspondent tele
graphs that according to semi-official in
formation received there the end of the
war 13 surely at hand. Under ordinary
circumstances not much Importance
would be attached, to such a statement,
but In view, of mysterious leakages in the
past of big War Office news it cannot be
disregarded. The correspondent say 3:
All sorts of rumors as to the terms
upon which the war would be settled were
flying about, and as there were no after
noon papers the excitement was all tha
greater. "While, of course, there was no
official announcement to base opinions
upon, every one seemed to think that to
morrow would bring forth a definite
statement.
NEWS REACHES DOVER.
As can well be imagined, London dis
cussed the situation to-day to the exclu
sion of every other topic. One heard peace
talk as people came out of church, as
they walked in Hyde Park, In hotels and
restaurantsâ In fact, everywhere that
Londoners congregate on Sunday. Every
one felt certain that the end was in
sight and that the Government had only
the details to arrange before making that
public announcement which has been so
anxiously awaited these many months.
In well informed circles it is said that
the negotiations have reached such a
stage that a proclamation of an armistice
may be expected at any moment. It will
be remembered that St. John Broderick
In the House of Commons several day..
ago said no armistice would be granted;
but it must not be forgotten that Brod
erick's answer could be taken as mean
ing that no armistice would be pro
claimed under the conditions existing at
that moment. But if, as is generally be
lieved, a definite basis for a possible set
tlement has now been arrived at by the
Boer leaders and Lord Kitchener an
armistice would follow as a matter of
course.
After the Ministers dispersed something
occurred which to-night was the talk oJ
London. Joseph Chamberlain drove to
Buckingham Palace, where he tooH
luncheon with the King, with whom ha
remained two hours. The Colonial Secre
tary Is supposed to have laid before h'.n
sovereign all the details of the South At*
rican negotiations.
A number of the members of the Cabi
net were at Downing street to-day, and
though it is said no Cabinet council was
held still it' can be stated ', wltn a consid
erable degree , of . positivenes3 that the
South African situation was again; under
discussionâ for the third time within
twenty-four hours.
CHAMBERLAIN" VISITS KING.
Late last night the Cabinet met ajain
and remained in session from 11 o'clock
until 1 o'clock this morningâ a most ex
traordinary proceeding. When the Minis
ters left for their homes they declined to
say anything at all regarding the nature
of the important business which had
called them together at such an unusual
hour. The supposition that the budget â¢
was the cause was no longer given ere- v
dence.
After the Cabinet meeting on Saturday
all reports tended to strengthen the belief
that the Government had considered tho
points of a preliminary agreement which
was likely to be reached In South Africa.
LONDON, April 13.â Excitement over
the prospects of early peace in South Af
rica was intense to-night. Up to midnight
no official announcement had been made
by the Government, but certain events of
the day were taken to indicate that a sat
isfactory conclusion was now very near
at hand.

BRUSSELS, April 13.â The threatening
aspect of a mob near the Maison du Peu
ple at U o'clock to-night caused the po
lice and gendarmes to charge it. Five of
the demonstrators were wounded. One of
the injured men will die. He received a
bayonet thrust In the back. Sixteen ar
rests were made.
This big casualty list for a comparative
ly insignificant encounter is taken as evi
dence that the gendarmes are disposed to
handle the groups without mercy.
The Burgomaster adopted most vigorous
measures during the evening. The whole
civic guard was mobilized and the squares
and streets in the vicinity of the Maison
du Peuple were occupied by 2500 of the
"corps elite." The disorderly element ap
peared cowed to-night as a result of the
repression of last evening, and there were
only a few trifling demonstrations. These
were immediately suppressed by charges
of the gendarmes. None of the latter
were injured.-
RIOTERS ABE .DISPERSED.
Late this evening a group of rioters in
sulted and Jeered at a cordon of the civic
guard In the Rue Rollebek, whereupon a
body of gendarmes was sent out 'and
caught the disturbers and badly mauled
them. But that this disturbance was not
tedious Is -shown by the- Â¦circumstance that
none of the men arrested carried weap
ons. A sample, however, of what the
worst class of rioters carried in the way
of arms was revealed when* a young man
who had been arrested at another point
was searched. A knife, a poignard, a fork
and a revolver were found in his pockets.
The police closed the Maison du Peuple
this evening, and no one was allowed In
the building. It was said to-night that
the central committee of the Young So
cialist Guard, fearing that the police will
search the various offices of the organi
zation, have ordered the local committee
to burn their archives and dissolve.
News received here from the industrial
towns Indicates that order prevailed in
those places to-day. A revisionist meet
ing was the only noteworthy incident at
Ghent. There fifty revisionists, among
those who had mobilized in view of the
strike, promenaded the streets arm in
arm, singing and acclaiming universal
suffrage.
POLICE SHOOT TO KILL.
The bloody repression of the disorders
of yesterday evening has created a pain
ful impression among all classes here, al
though it is appreciated that the majorlty
of the victims of the encounters did not
belong to the better classes of workmen.
Yesterday, for the first time, the police
really fired their rifies, loaded with ball
cartridges. Previous to that they had used
their swords and revolvers, the latter be
ing usually loaded with blank cartridges.
Saturday's rioters were composed of the
dregs of the population, with a sprinkling
cf what is called the Young Socialist
Guard, composed of mere boys, with little
regard for the orders of M. Van Der
Velde, a member of the Chamber of Dep
uties and the leader of the Socialist move
ment in Belgium, and the Socialist com
mittee.
It must be explained that the Malson
flu Peuple Is situated on the upper slope
of a hill, that the central boulevard and
most of the business portion of the city
lies at the foot of this hill, while the royal
palace, the law courts, the Chamber of
Deputies and the Ministries stand upon
the ridge of thÂ© hill. The quarter around
the Malson du Peuple is the worst In the
city. It is a perfect rookery of low-class
dwellings, intersected by steep and nar
row streets and malodorous alleys. In
the vicinity of the Malson there are some
small squares. In which' the rioters gath
ered yesterday evening until they were
dispersed and the squares occupied by de
tachments of the civic guard. The mob
was mainly composed of the rough popu
lation of the quarter, who Jeered and re
viled the police when they were forced
along the streets by the cordons of of
ficers.
BOUGHS START THE BIOT.
The serious troubles began when a num
ber of roughs from a safe distance fired
revolvers in the direction of the cordons.
The gendarmes then charged with drawn
swords. After firing at the crowd with
revolvers loaded with blank cartridges,
they were greeted with a. nail or missiles,
such as stones, bcttles and heavy iron
rivets. This occurred In several streets.
Jt was worse In the Rue Haute, where
the occupants of the houses rained mis
siles upon the heads of the gendarmes.
An officer, of the gendarmes then shouted
to the crowd to disperse. No notice was
taken of this order.
Then, for the first time in many years,
the gendarmes fired their Mauser car
bines, loaded with what are called strike
cartridge*, which contain a ball, but ; a

that it- was -no time to., take prisoners,

be. Major \ -Waller said | General Smith
had told him to kill all over 10 years "old.

that Major Waller was under military,
not martial; law in Samar. .The men shot.'
he said, had "done nothing deserving 'of
such punishment. He blamed Waller for

Lagoncy, In South Camarlnes province,

The merchants declare they are unan

they will become victims of the lawless
element at the cost of ' their lives and
property. They said that if the. American
troops leave Â¦ the town the Cnemy could
reduce the food supply of the inhabitants
and retard the advance of the soldiers
coming to their rescue, and that such ac
tion would lead to irreparable damage.
The merchants further declare the local

that the detachments of American troops
have withdrawn from? the neighboring

The maddened bull attacked fiercely
after that, driving the lion into his cor
ner and goring him twenty-five times in
the body. The lion retaliated by seizing
the bull s nose. He again lost his hold
and the bull gored him repeatedly, break
ing his leg and causing him to roar with
pain. At this juncture, while the excite
ment was at its . height, the bugler em
ployed by the Mayor of Juarez sounded a
call for the combat to cease, and the lion,
more dead than alive, was dragged from
the huge iron cage where the right had
taken place. His wounds, it is said, will
prove fatal. The bull was game to the
last. He almost succeeded , in killing a
Mexican banderilla, who was luring him
from the arena.
EL PASO, Tex., April 13.â The most
bloody and brutal encounter between wild
beasts ever seen in this section of the
â¢ country took place in the Juarez (Mexico)
bull ring to-day between a young Nu
midian lion from South Africa and a
Samalayuca bull from the wilds of Mex
ico. An audience of three thonsand peo
ple, prircipally made up. of Americans,
Â¦witnessed the battle from the grand
stand, which surrounds the huge . iron
cage set up in the arena. The light last
ed nearly an hour and was linally stopped
by the Mexican authorities, who admitted
that their own national sport of â¢ bull
fighting had 'been outclassed in point of
brutality. The bull was a splendid speci
men anil was courageous in the extreme.
From tbb beginning he recognized in the
lion a deadly enemy and attacked the
king of beasts reaaily and with great
â¢spirit. The lion, whicn had been reared
as a. pet. refused to light at the outset
and attempted to break through the bars
: to .seek refuge beside his keeper, who
stood without and pitilessly goaded the
' beast by striking him with an iron bar
or by pouring vitriol on his body. Finally,
realizing that escape was hopeless, the
lion crouched for a spring and launched
himself into the air. landing upon the
bull's back and fastening his teetn in the
bovine's neck. His hold was insecure and
he was easily shaken off, but the bull
bled from a number of wounds.
Special Dispatch .to The Call.
ST. PETERSBURG. April 13.â Consul
Campbell has gone to the United States,
declaring he intends to place his reals
nation In the hands of Secretary of State
Hay. This brings to an end thft misun
derstandings which have lasted six
months.
On the death of Joseph Rawitz. tor
many years American Consul at War
saw, his nephew, Vladislaw Rawitz. the
surviving head of the Rawitz banking
house, signified his desire to succeed to
the Warsaw consulship. W. R. Â«oÂ»o
way, the United Sttca Consul General at
St. Petersburg, with the assent of
Charlemagne Mower, the American Em
bassador to Russia, recommended that
Vladislaw Rawitz be given this post, say
ing that the omce had been excellenuy
managed by Josepii Rawitz, and that the
Rawltzs enjoyed an excellent reputa-
U Jeremiah Curtin, formerly secretary of
the United States Embassy here, caused
the hrst complication by requesung that
Herr Wolff, the publisher of Sieiikie
wick's works, be appointed c 2S? u i *
Warsaw. H. H. D. i^erce. the Third As
sistant Secretary of State, wrote Hollo
v-a" and asked him if he insisted on his
recommendation.' Holloway did insist
upon the appointing of Vladislaw Rawitz,
and Tower undertook discreetly to sound
the Russian Government regarding the
acceptability of that gentleman. This in
quiry, by .some mlstaxe, caused the is
suance of an exequateur for Rawitz. As
the consular position at Warsaw Is highly
esteemed. Rawitz immediately received
congratulatory visits from the local ofri
cers and the other Consuls. At this stage
of the proceedings Rawitz became great
ly embarrassed, a* etiquette required that
his first visit be paid the Governor Gen
eral, and this was Impossible without
American papers.
William M. Osborne, United States Con
sul General ' in Â¦ London, here intervened
by recommending the appointment ot
Campbell, an American dentist in Lon
don, who formerly lived In Warsaw.
Rawitz became very much perturbed by
newspaper statements that Campbell had
been appointed on the ground of hia
American citizenship. He made persis
tent but ineffectual attempts to get Hol
loway and Tower further to support his
cause.
, In the meantime a storm had gathered
over Campbell's head. The consular
clerk at Warsaw, voicing the alleged
widespread objection of the Inhabitants
of that city to the American, wrote Gen
eral Holloway that Campbell could not
anticipate an exequateur. as his real
name was Finkelstein. and he was born
In Lemberg. The consular clerk further
charged that Campbell had given differ
ent birthplaces In his application for
passports, and that local society was
against . him because of his elopement
with an heiress of Warsaw. Campbell
came here and ridiculed these chai ges.
asserted that he was a Christian, that
he was born in Montreal, Canada: that
he was a naturalized American citizen,
and formerly a dentist in Chicago. Ho
declared that his mother-in-law was re
sponsible for the charges against him,
which she brought at the desire of with
holding 100,000 rubles due his wife from
the paternal estate. Consul General Hol
loway was sifting this matter when he
was informed that Campbell had aban
doned the fight.

Two months agro an "old school" physi-
cian of this city, who enjoys a large prac-
tice, called at our office with his wife.
He was barely able to be out. He could
hardly walk, his voice was halting and
there were marked evidences of uraemlc
poisoning. He was so far along with,
Bright's Disease that a crisis was Im-
minent. In fact he expected convulsions
and a fatal ending at any moment, and
the very day he called discussed the ad-
visability of cremation with bis wife. He
was so positive that nothing could be
done for him that he only came to please
his wife. ~
Although almost In extremis we told
him we thought he could recover.- He
wanted to know about the- cost. We told
htm there would be none if upon recov-
ery he would admit It and say what did It.
This gave him confidence and he went at
It In earnest.. In two weeks he sent for
more, admitting that" it had taken hold.
Two weeks later the same report, and two
weeks Â¦ thereafter he called at our office.
Both, he and his wife were the happiest
people we have seen -f&r many a day
He is getting well, and on the first day
of April resumed hla practice. He per-
mits us to refer to him. and If any physi-
cian suffering similarly will call we will
make him the same offer and take him
up and Introduce him to the convalescing
physician for a personal Interview.

MONTEVIDEO, April 14.â News has
been received here from the Swedish Ant-
Arctic expedition, whose - leader is Dr.
iOtto" Nordenskjold. The expedition dis
embarked at Snow Hill, Louis Philippe
1-and. It Was accompanied by the sur
geon Dr. Eklof, the Argentina lieutenant,
Sobral and two sailors, one of whom was
a. member of the Duke of Abruzzi's Arctic
expedition. Dr. Nordenslcjold's -vessel,
the Antarctic, tried to sail directly south
Jrozn Cape Horn, but too many icebergs
were encountered and there was danger
of the ship being imprisoned for a long
time. Dr. Xordenskjold decided to change
his course. His expedition will remain at
Snow Hill until next summer.

TACOMA, "Wash., April 13.â Residents of
Nome. St. Michael and other Lower Yu
kon towns will make strenuous efforts
this year to have the Federal Government
provide that section with a properly
equipped insane asylum. Every year a
number of men and women lose their
reason from various causes and yet can
be given only the poorest kind of treat
ment on account cf the meager facilities
in that rough country. The most notable
case of haraship resulting from the pres
ent "status of affairs Is that of Father
Jacquet, the Catholic priest who went in
sane sx Nome six months ago. Â¦ In No
vember he was taken nearly 1000 miles
overland from Ncaie to Holy Cross Mis
sion on the Yukon. During the trip he
suffered severely from the cold weather.

0N INVITATION
Continued From Page One. â¢
OKLAHOMA CITY. O. T., April 13.â
Rather than kill the man he said had de
frauded him. A, N. Smith, one of the Ter
ritory's best known cattlemen, shot and
killed himself yesterday. He left a let
ter which stated that on account of his
Masonic oath he could not kill "Jack"
Stribbling, another cattleman, and, fear
ing he would commit murder in a fit of
anger, he would kill himself.
The two men had been close- friends.
During the winter of Urito they fed a large
herd of cattle together, and afterward
Smith claimed he nad to pay all the ex
penses out of his half of the profits. A
suit in court followed and a verdict for
55000 was awarded Stribbling. Smith al
'ways claimed Stribbling had defrauded
him out of that amount of money, and
he feared he would kill him as result.
Both men were Masons and very wealthy.

!
;
Not long ago a French explorer. 1L
Charles Meissen, in traveling through
Slam, observed a species of small gray
ants which were new to him. These anta
â¢were much engaged In traveling: they
lived in damp places and went In troops.
To hl3 surprise he noticed among: them,
from time to time an occasional ant which
was much larger than the others and
moved at a much swifter pace, and each
of these larger ants, M. Meissen saw, al
ways carried one of the gray anta on it3
hack. -> This discoverey led him 'to watch
their movements closely. He soon* saw
that while the main body of gTay ants was

"The operator kneels, holding the xound

must be jumped quickly to the top, and
the operation continued with a3 little In

"In half a minute more, if this is done
rightly, a small quantity of. dust will be

When Postage Was High.
Â¦ j Youn g men. ; who . were, courting sweet
hearts fn the year 1S20 either .had to be
content with 'writing- only a few letters or
take the risk of running up large bills for
postage. According to Poor Will's Al
manac for that year, the rates of post
ago at that time were.: On single letters,
carried any distance not exceeding thirty
m?les. 6 cents;, over thirty and not over
eighty, 10 cents; over eighty and not over
"150 miles, 12Vi-cent3; over 130 and not over
400 miles, :1S% cents; over .400 : miles; - 4 25
cents.- -Double letters, or those composed
of two pieces of paper, . double those
rates. Triple letters, or those composed
of three pieces of paper, triple those rates.
Packets or letters composed of four or
more pieces of paper, or one or . more
other articles, and weighing one ounce
avoirdupois, quadruple those rates, and in
that proportion for all greater weight.
Ship Utters not carried by mail. 6 cents.
The rate for newspapers, was: Carried
100 miles, 1 cent; over 100 miles, 1% cents.
But if carried to any place within | the
State where printed, whatever be the dis
tance, the rate Is only ' 1 cent. It was
evidently cheaper at that time to set
married than to keep on writing long let
ters. Besides, there waa not much room
for sentimental gush,- for 6 cents a day
for aletter to go thirty miles meant that
the young lady concerned had to do with
out fee cream and soda water, providing
those luxuries were> known to young men
and maidens of eighty-two years ago.
Perhaps the most fatal kiss ever known
was that given by a young-Spanish sailor
to his fiancee nine years ago, for it
brought about the decimation of a tow-n."

But the sailor disobeyed orders :iind ; put
oft* in a boat for the shore one evening,
where,- having sought out his J fiancee,
whom- he had not seen for some. years, he 1
kissed her. A few 'days later the effects
of the kiss became painfully- Â¦ evident,
'though "the culprit returned to^hlaship
by stealth the same night. The girl sue-.

total population of 1500. â¢' â" â¢"-
Kisses once cost the lives of many
brave soldiers in the British army. . The
beautiful Duchess of y Gordon- in -1794
raised the famous Gordon Highlanders by
giving a thousand recruits . a kiss and 1 ' a
golden guinea apiece. The regiment was
raised to its full strength. in a- few days.
The men were then sent out against {he
French, and in the very first battle jn
which they took part more than 250 fell
either killed or wounded. ..,',i ;' ; â¢ â¢
Previous to this, In 1718. a war was
brought about by a thoughtless' kiss on
the part of a young Bavarian prince'- of
somewhat reckless character, named Fer

state he Inadvertently kissed a beauti

His Inexpensive Campaign.
The Republican opposition to the bill, as
shown last Tuesday on the motion to go
into committee of the whole, Is in the
neighborhood of forty. Added to â¢ the
Democratic vote, if solidly cast, the oppo
sition would have a clear majority of ten.
But the Republican leaders profess con
fidence in their belief that not enough of
the .Republican recalcitrants will go to
the lergth of voting to override the chair
to make with the Democrats a majority
of the House. Moreover, they assert that
â¢some of the Democrats themselves will
hesitate to adopt this method of getting
a. vote on a proposition which they con
tend is plainly not gerroain.
With every new move the "last ditch
S9" take new courage, and they begin the
second week of the debate more defiant
than ever. They are still laboring with ,
recalcitrants and- may be compelled to
again call in the services of the Presi
dent, who is watching the contest with
renewed anxiety.
When the measure is thrown open un
der the five-minute rule a great number
cf amendments will be otfered by the
Democrats, with a view of opening up a
way for amending the schedules of the
Dingley tariff law. It is known in ad
vance that all such amendments will be
held to be not germaln to the bill, whose
title provides for reciprocity with Cuba,
and that only amendments raising or low
ering the amount of the proposed conces
sion will be held to be in order. Appeals
will be taken from the rulings of the
chair on the general tariff amendments,
but it is certain that, with possibly one
exception, the appeals will be unsuccess
ful. That exception may be the-amend
ment : to take the â¢ differential off refined
sugar. It is admitted on both sides of
the chamber that the real fight will come
on that amendment. A -number of Re
3>ublicans who are opposing the bill have
announced that they will vote to overrule
the chair on that proposition, and the
Democrats expect , to be able to cast a.
solid vote for it.
The weakness of the â¢ position of the
friends of this proposition is that the test
will not come directly on the amendment,
but on the ruling of the chair. If a mo
tion to recommit, with instructions to re
port back such an amendment, is made, it
will be held not to be in order, under the
general theory of*parliamentary law that
the House cannot instruct the committee
to dp what it itself cannot do.

W.. WASHINGTON, April 13.â Cuba's
cause is in shcal water again,, and delay
is certain. ;> \-iy-\ Â¦.
With adjournment less than two months
away, no date has been set for a vote in
the House. Names are still being added
to the list of speakers, already very long,
and, unwilling to trust the Democrats, to
whom they must look for help, the Ways
and Means leaders do not dare at present
to force a vote on limiting the debate.
The bill will reach the Senate when that
body Ib in the throes of another Philippine
debate, which will be followed by long
consideration of the isthmian canal bin.
When the steering committee finally a3Â»
signs Cuba a place on the calendar Sen
ator Burrows and his fellow obstruction
ists will then see that the contest is pror
longed.
Assuming that- the bill pass the Senate,
it will be well on toward June 1, and it
will come out in sucb form that its
fathers in the House will never be able to
recognize it. Then, will follow another
contest in conference committee, which
the Senate conferees probably will win,
and after that the fight must be fought
ail over again in the iiouse over the con
ference report. Add to all. this an undis
guised desire on the part of the Demo
crats to let the Republicans go before the
voters next fall without Tiaving relieved

ply, since the Democrats hold the key to

General Brooke, during the Civil War ren

obtain a commission and throughout the Civil
War he retained his advantage, ending the
war as General Miles" senior. After peace
came. General Miles was promoted over Gen
eral Brooke's head. " â¢ :â¢" i
i As General Brooke will necessarily hold thÂ»
position but a brief period before hia retire
ment for age. General S. B. M. Young is like
ly to succeed General Brooke and General
Chaffee's promotion will follow two years
hence. Â¦-..... ... . .. .-xÂ« '',.-.'
. . In other words,' the general has himself reo
ommended and profited by the very action
which his friends now fear may be taken at
Â¦his expense. If he should go out before Gen
eral Brooke is retired. General Brooke, who lÂ»
General Miles' senior both in service and In j
age. . and who did gallant . and distinguished
wcrK as a .volunteer in the Civil War. would
undoubtedly be put in his place as lieutenant
general, as It is known that the administra
tion has been very desirous of recognizing
General Brooke's long and faithful service.
A3 some of General Miles" friends have said Â¦
that It would be unfair to retire him, ..-.Â¦ tt â¢
should be said in the first place that hÂ« se
cured his promotion to a brigadier general
ship only through the similar forced retire
ment of General Ord, he himself being Jumped
over by a number of his senior officers In tha
vacancy .thus created; " and. In. the second .
place, that the ..only, action of the ' kind tak?n
by President. Roosevelt I since he has f been in
office was in the case of Colonel Noyes, who
was compulsorlly retired after reachlrfg the
aigti. of 62, on the recommendation of General
Miles. - ' . Â¦ â¢--â¢'-
.Gti'eral Mile? and Secretary Root. Â¦ At pres

heavier burden â¢ than any other, member . of

carry- it at all, and now, -at the very titnÂ»
when he requires the most loyal support of
every subordinate who -wishes well to the
army and the nation, he lias to spend much .
of his strength in meeting' the opposition of
thi commanding general, if General Miles is
retired it will be simply because, after a pa-' '
titnt trial. President Roosevelt feels that on
the highest ethical grounds his retention would
work grave. and lasting Injury to the army as

In â¢ the West Thirty-seventh district,
where the trouble started two weeks ago.
the same condition prevailed.' The police
Were active, the saloons closed and the
Raines law hotels doing a big business.
Â¦There was but. one arrest in daylight
hours. In the other parts of the city
somewhat similar conditions- prevailed.
The police of this district were very ac
tive as well, and there, was but a small
attempt to do business. : Up to 8 o'clock
in the evening there had not been an ar

NEW YORK, April 13.â The New Yorker
who wanted a drink of intoxicating liquor
to-day discovered that the enforcement 01
the excise law, through the - combined ef
forts of the 'uniformed police and * the
members of the State Liquor Dealers' As
sociation, had assumed Â¦ several i new as
pects/ The first -was y that while it was
much harder than here toforo to get a
drink in a saloon holding merely a liquor
tax" or a' certificate"; It was mmch easier to
obtain one in a Raines law 'hotel. ' The
buyer also found that while last Sunday
be was served either with a plate of
cheese and' crackers: with" his drink' or
was given a sandwich, to eat or not, as
he " choose, to-day I he . could . not buy a
drink, without also buying a sandwich.
Saloon men who were seen during. the
day seemed to believe that the police.ac
tivity had much to do with the saloons
being kept tightly â¢ closed, for the most
part, and argued that the hotel men -were
doing more business " because they had
been studying what they could and could
not , dp with impunity. The Raines law
hotels throughout the city were, as a rule,
exceedingly well patronized. ;'Â¦ .
In the- tenderloin district there were
very few ' places without . a hotel license
that made any attempt Â¦ to ' do ' business.
The district, -it was said, was closea tight
er than had been known in years. ' The
plan; of selling in rooms overhead the sa
loon and similar ruses were .done away
with', seemingly - for the â¢ reason that the
dealers thought the trouble too great and
the compensation -too small, v .

Parsimony Comes to Grief.
Lady barbers were not unknown to
Shakespeare, who knew everything.
When Pandarus saw Helen of Troy, ex
amining the fifty-two, hairs which com
posed the sparse beard of Troilus he could
net "choose but laugh to think how. she
tickled his chin with her marvellous
white hand." And did not the -Shraw^
Intimate to : Hortensio that she might
"comb his . noddle with < a three-] eg&eil
stool"?â a proceeding well calculated â¢ to
make each particular hair stand on end.
Finally. Shakepeare knew all , the re
quirements â¢ cf a first-class shop. "Have
napkins about you" Is the advice in
"Macbeth," and -Grumio's injunction ! i?,
"Let the heads be "sleekly â¢ combed- and
the blue coats brushed." Every barber
has an "oily palm," of course, and, like
Richard III, is often "at charges :Â¦â¢: for
a looking glass." . Unlike â¢ Mercutlo, he
will not -"quarrel with a man that hath
hair mote or less in his beard.'' Â¦
The attention ...of . supporters of the
Bacon cipher cult Js j respectively called
to this "mask." - .
Although no barber appears . In the
great throng of personages high" and
low. wise and " foolish, who come upon
Shakespeare's stage, there is no lack of
tonsorial Jingo. "I must, to the barber,
monsieur," says Bully 'Bottom,' "for me
thinks I am. marvellously -hairy- about
the face"; and Bardolph, according to
Falstaff, was shaved once, and "lost
many a hair." Marc Antony was a great
patron of the shop and a stickler for
a close shave, "being barbered ten times
o'er" upon one occasion when he callod
upon Cleopatra. In "Corlolanus" Mar
cius exclaims with professional ardor,
"O. let. me clip ye," whereat * one is re
minded, of Petruchio's "Here's snip and
nTp-and cut and slit- and slash." - i.Â«
There must have been \ shampooing,
too, in -Will Shakepeare's shop, t else
why, did Iago say, "1 have rubbed ' llit-s
young quat-almoÂ«t to the sense!" Ham
let's "Ay, there's the rub," expressed
his satisfaction in 'the soothing process,
and as the barber hastened 'â¢ his "knotted
and combined Â¦ locks to part," mayhap
he fell asleep, "perchance ..to dream,"
under the soporific Â¦ touch " of tonsorial
Â¦digits. ; --, 'Â¦Â¦:'>Â¦:Â¦.:-'Â¦, Â¦:,âÂ¦Â¦.Â¦Â¦;.Â¦

In considering the theory . that - Shake
speare was a barber it must be remem
bered that his father was a wool comb
er, says a writer in the Kansas City Jour
nal. This is a strong point, as the two
professions seem to be cognate. Further
more, among the innumerable - ways of
spelling the poet's name we find "Shak
berd" or "Shaxberd," and these vari
ants have a" peculiar significance; * For
it is plain as a pikestaff that in the un
settled orthography of the period they
are simply Shakebeard, a descriptive ap
pellation that needs no comment. It
points as -directly to the barber shop as
Smith to the smithy. And it is curious
in this connection to find the -king in
"Hamlet" saying:
You n:ust not think
That ive are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook. '

The change in the direction of the road
near Wadsworth is causing much de
pression among the residents, and many
cf them are already offering their prop
erty for an extremely low figure. Ac
cording to the new survey Wadsworth,
a town of nÂ«arly 1500 inhabitants, will
be placed more than three miles : from
the new track. As the town depends
entirely upon the railroad for suppcrt,
the division repair shops giving employ
ment to many men, it probably will be
wiped from the maps when the course
of the road Is altered. The shops," it Is
rumored, will be rebuilt in Reno, and
the division *Â»xtrndefl farther oast.
The cost of the construction of this
lengthy piece of bridgework will be
$5,wu,0o0. The entire length of the cut
off will be 1U4.4 miles, and it will save
41.1 miles and several heavy grades over
the promontory. The Utah Construction
Company is now at work on the urst
section, including fourteen miles of
trace from Ogden to the lake shore,
trading will be rusned from Lucin within
h week, and the material for the trestles
is rapidly piling up in the railroad yards.
The manner m which tne immense
htretch of bridgework will be placed has
nut yet definitely been decidea, but the
contractors will have their plans laid
out before the new track reaches the lake
shore. It will take more than two years
to complete the cut-off, and nearly low
men will be employed upon it.
The railroad track at Elko will be
moved in oraer to do away with a curve
just below the town. When the work is
aone the present depot a.nd hotel will
be torn down and a new passenger and
freight depot erected on the site of the
old freighi depot.
Mr. Patterson, right-of-way agent for
the Southern Pacific Company, is in town
arranging for a right of way for a new
line to be constructed between Osino
and the North Fork, "i The survey, as
adopted at the San Francisco offices of
the company, strikes northeast from
Osino in an air line, then makes one
long curve and runs southeast to the
North Fork. The distauce between Osi
no and the North Fork is about six
miles by the section lines. The old road
between the points is full of curves and
heavy grades. The new line cuts ov.t
the curves, and the grades are overcome
by tunnels 4100. 2590 and 1700 feet in
length. The new line will save fully one
third of the distance and all the grade.
ELKO, New, April 13.â The extensive
Improvements that are being made by
the Southern ' Pacific Company from one
end of its route to the other involve sev
eral â¢ wonderful feats of engineering.
After the tunneling of the Sierras for
a distance of rive miles the construction
of the Ogden-Lucin cut-on! is the n?ost
iniportant. A trestle will be run across
the northern end of the great Salt Lake,
and will paÂ£Â» over the water a dlstar.ee
of ten miles. The undertaking is excit
ing interest in all the leading engineer
ing centers, anU is the result of a con
ference on the part of many experts.

For three years past President Hill of
the Great Northern has had experts
scouring Montana. Idaho and Washington
for iron ore bodies. They found some low
grade iron, but nothing comparing with
that of the British Columbia Islands.
That the islands contained some iron
has been known tor years, but not until
Hewitt began Investigation was tne ex
tent of tne. Â¦ deposits - even- dreamed of.
Tests made unuer the auspices of the
Northern Pacific Hallway. over two years
ago showed that the product of these
ranges comprises the finest kind of.bes
semer iron because of the almost .abso
lute absence of phosphorus. Adjacent to
the iron ledges are found great bodies of
limestone.
The most important deposits have been
secured at low figures by purchase out
right or by options by men who have un
dertaken the establishment of an- im
mense iron and steel plant. At the head
of the syndicate , is .Henry Hewitt, tne

for something to radically dispose of the

an advertisement which stated that
Doan'e Kidney Pills could be depended

there has not been a symptom of a re-

cial;or industrial; advancement. The only thing that
enterprise ; or public , spirit can do to promote the
growth of the city is to make it so beautiful and so
attractive that Americans of the leisure class will es
tablish .winter homes there. It : is now recognized
that, it; can never become, the political capital of 'the
republic in anything but name; for the great leaders
of the country who. shape politics as well as busi
ness and. finance do not live there, the great news
papers are not published there, and the active organ
ization and operation of party" politics is not carried
onthere^ In short,, theonly hope of the. citizens is
that Washington may be made the most : sumptuous
capital in the world, with the most magnificent build
ings, the finest streets and the rmost cultured â¢: society.'

The feeling of the Washingtonians is the natural
result of an unnatural situation. , The city, though
the capital of the republic, is virtually isolated from
national life. Measures passed for the general good
of the country affect Washington only in an indirect
way. It has_ no industries to receive the benefit of
protection, no commerce to be affected, by the up
building of , our merchant marine, 1 no agriculture ;to
foster, and no large financial institutions to be
helped or hindered by financial legislation." Such be
ing the case, the Washingtoniah lives for his city
alone, and when the: city .gets nothing, it is to the
people of the capital as if Congress were dead.
So completely:: is v Washington isolated 'from,; the
WASHINGTON - people are irritated and
somewhat indignant over the, apparent : in
difference of Congress to the . elaborate
plans that have been devised for beautifying! and
adorning the city. It seems the leaders of. neither
party are taking much interest in the subject, and
some. of the bills for municipal- improvement, which
Washington is most eager to have enacted may be

THE, ? 3SrA.TIOKT-A.T_i O-A^iPITAL.
Editor The Callâ I have been much in
terested lnybur repeated editorials upon
the great need, of preserving our forests.
The- subject cannot be written ;upon * too
frequently, for It Is - really the, most Im
portant matter connected with the ma
terial good of our State. \
I .There is one phase of the subject which
I have hot seen presented m the columns
of your paper and I write to request you
to discuss It editorially. It is briefly this:
â¢When standing timber is taxed for its
full value, or even a considerable part of
that 1. value i'- there is always a temptation
en the part of ,the . owner to cut if down.
By .so ; doing he .would [ not only , realize on
the .wood : and- lumber! but would . escape
the 1: taxes in , future, since j the bare land
would . have lost most of its former value.
In other s words,,the State exacts a yearly
penalty, Â¦ as it '.were,, from every one Â¦ who
preserves i a grove or a' forest.
. Now.it. is true that. growing timber ben
'eflts the ; whole r , people ' by ' improving cli
matic conditions. Would' It not be an act
of \i justice as \ well ;" as ' prudence \ for the
people â¢ of this . State to change the laws,
or If * necessary the constitution, Â¦ : so \ that
growing forests^ should . npt '. ; . be " taxed for
more . than the Rvalue 'of . the â¢ land, _but that

PERSONAL NOTES.
BELGIUM is at last undergoing the political
storm that has been so long threatened. Last
year the danger of the outbreak that has now
occurred was imminent, and was avoided only by
compromises and' other dilatory tactics. It was be
lieved then that delay would give time for reflection,
and that with reflection there would come an agree
ment between the workingmen and the Conservatives
upon some plan of settling the issue that divides
them.. The expectation, however, has not been ful
filled. The only effect of the delay seems to have
been an increase of antagonism, and now the out
break has come with a fury that threatens revolution.
The demand of the workingmen and the Socialists
is for a revision of the constitution and the establish
ment of universal suffrage, such 'as obtains in the
United States. The present suffrage laws of Belgium
are the result of a compromise and have not been
long in operation. By their provisions every Belgian
citizen over twenty-five years of age, domiciled for
not less than one year in some commune, and not
specifically disqualified by law, has a vote. Every
citizen over thirty-five years of age, married or wid
.ower, having legitimate children and paying at least
$1 a year in house tax, has a supplementary vote, as
has also every citizen over twenty-five years of age
owning real, estate to the value of $400, or having a
corresponding income from such property, or deriv
ing $20 a year or more from Belgian funds, either
directly or through a savings bank." Moreover, every
citizen over twenty-five years of age who has re
ceived a diploma or certificate of higher education,
or who fills or has filled an office or engaged in pri
vate professional practice necessitating higher educa
tion, also receives two supplementary votes.
It will be noted that by these laws suffrage in' / Bel-
The question of. revising the suffrage' laws is at
present .before the Chamber of Deputies, and accord
ing to programme is to be taken up; on Wednes
day. .The Socialists, for some reason, have become
suspicious that the Â¦ Government will prorogue the
Chamber before that/date, and the riots have been
the result of the suspicions. A dispatch states that
the King is willing to - conciliate the workingmen,
but the Ministry, is resolved not 'to concede equal
manhood suffrage. Such is the situation at present,
and it is probable the coming week will find Belgium
involved in something like' civil. war, or a strike so
widespread , and' so formidable as to j virtually ! put a
stop to the" entire' industries of the country.
â â â â - â . â¢ . â¢.. .. Â¦ . .
The use of the "strike" as a political weapon is
very effective in Belgium by reason of the high in
dustrial organization of the people. The Belgians
are a race of manufacturers, and in comparison with
other peoples their industrial development may be
called abnormal, so much does the â¢ proportion of
the wage-earning class exceed that of the similar
class elsewhere." At the present time some of the
leaders of the workingmen have advised them to ab
stain from rioting and to resort to a general strike
throughout the kingdom. â¢ It was by the use of such
tactics they succeeded in the former struggle, and a
resort to . them now promises better results than any
outbreaks of violence which would bring them into
conflict with i the army. . '
gium is not based solely upon manhood. Some citi
zens have more- votes than others, and consequently
property owners and professional men have an ad
vantage over other classes at the polls. The laws;
however, are a great improvement over those which
preceded them, and were obtained by the advocates
of universal suffrage only after a prblonged struggle
ending in a general strike.
THE BELGIAN TROUBLES.
Conditions in California and San Francisco remain
as previously stated. Reports from all counties and
all lines of farming and trading operations are uni
formly cheerful and show general activity all along
the line. As far as crops are concerned the season
has thus far been ideal, and even man himself, great
and august as he is, could hardly have improved on
the operations of that Creator who is supposed to
know what a man needs about, as well as man him
self. From the Oregon line to San Diego the Stite
smiles with the promise of plenty, and if . the Cali
fornian is not satisfied with this season as far as it
has gone, he never will be satisfied with anything on
this earth. Money is abundant and readily obtain
able by any solvent borrower, collections are good,
failures are few and small, there is a large influx, of
Eastern people into the State, building operations
were never livelier, and we seem to be having a high
old time with prosperity all around. J ,
The cereal markets have been more active during
the past week. Wheat has fluctuated more or less,
having been influenced by dry weather complaints
in the Southwest and the issuance of the crop esti
mates of the Agricultural and Census departments.
The Census Department estimates the crop of wheat,
oats and corn at 846,000,000 bushels more than the
Agricultural Department, and the discrepancy is so
wide that it is said that the latter department will
adjust its figures to a certain conformity to those of
the former. The census figures indicate a winter
wheat crop of about 415,000,000 bushels, against 365,
000,000 last year, and if they are within a reasonable
distance of the real production there will be no wheat
famine in the United States this year. But the South
west undoubtedly needs more rain to properly ma
ture the winter crop.
Otherwise there is little new in trade. As far as
can be seen from the weekly commercial Teports from
the different sections of the country, business seems
brisk everywhere, and even the South is sending in
fair reports. Jobbing distribution in the East and
central West is falling off, bat there is no slackening
in the spring wheat regions, and unusual activity is
reported from the Pacific Coast. Some of the sta
ples, such as wool, sugar and provisions, have weak
ened off during the past few days, but these condi
tions are considered transitory and regularly occur,
no matter how active general trade may be.
WHILE general trade throughout the United
States continued to halt last week, the halt
ing tendency was less pronounced and con
ditions appeared rather better. The decrease in bank
clearings was smaller, being only 1 0.6 per cent, and
fewer cities showed a loss, the only important ones
being New York, Boston, Pittsburg, Baltimore and
Detroit. The continued loss at Pittsburg rather in
dicates less activity in the iron and steel trade, which
has been observed for some weeks, though the move
ment in this industry is still active and the mills are
generally running to their full capacity on structural
material, it being understood that the order books
are filled almost up to the close of 1902. New orders,
however, are not as heavy as they were last year. In
the case of New York the current inactivity in Wall
street probably accounts for the loss in bank clear
ings there, as there is little speculation in the street
now, and no talk is heard of pending combinations,
new trusts, gigantic syndicates, and those vast un
dertakings which for several years have filled the
world with wonder. Perhaps those already in opera
tion have absorbed pretty much all the idle blocks
of capital, the possession of which seemed to worry
the financiers just as coppers burn the pockets of a
schoolboy until the nearest bakery absorbs his little
surplus and he is free from care again. Certainly
there is no longer any feverish rush to launch im
mense syndicates upon the fickle sea of commerce,
and it is just as well, for there are plenty of them
now.
BUSINESS IMP ROVING AGAIN*
FOREST PRESERVATION
IT Is wonderful how clever society buds can become nowadays. In addition
to all the accomplishments they are known to possess, they are really in
genious to a degree that the outside world never hears about. Take Kathryn
Robinson, for instance. Many know of her patrician, beauty, her generous
nature and clever sayings, but she has many other talents you will never
hear of unless some of the other girls tell you. Just now they are talking
about her artistic eye for, good lines and color combinations In building French/
hats. She wore a poem at the tea on Saturday with her thin white gown. The
hat was entirely of tiny -white tulle ruffles, less than an inch wide, and trimmed
with dainty sprays of autumn leaves. The hat was simple, but there was a
quiet elegance any style about it that did credit to the fair Kathryn. I heard
'Â¦ two debutantes, whose gowns come from way across the p^nd, delighting over
| the promise that she would make them each a present of one. I am sure they
will be* most becoming. . .. ,
- Perhaps you didn't know either that Elsie Sperry and Kathryn Robinson
get together and make silk flowers and butterflies, embroidered In spangles, for
their hair, with a style that wins them loads of pretty compliments. Miss
Sperry learned this art while in Paris and her friend was not long In doing
the same. . - . Â¦ â¢ -, . - - .' " . Â¦ "

Miss Williar gave a delightfully informal tea at her artistic home in Sausa
- lito yesterday afternoon-and ever so many of the girls went over from the city
. in their newest frocks." There were just enough popular men present to Insure
' a pleasant afternoon ; for everybody and the hostess proved herself a charming
entertainer.: Everything was perfectly arranged for the comfort of the guests
and they could not resist staying rather longer than is polite at teas. The decora
tions were spring blossoms. Some one remarked that they looked like the
hostess; at any rate, they bore her care- free and happy touch.

Miss Catherine Herrin was , certainly a picture at the Preston wedding.
One always expects to see Miss Herrin wearing handsome gowns with that
splendid style of hers, but on this occasion she attracted even more admiration
than ever In a white chiffon and lace decollete gown over white silk, with garni
ture of gold. She wore in her hair a red chiffon rose, embroidered in gold
spangles. The carriage wrap was an exquisite affair of heavy gray peau de sole,
lined with pink satin. There were . pink chiffon flounces inside the collar and
downthe front, with a touch of white. As usual there were men galore stand
ing- about, waiting to hold her wrap or do anytlnjng- in their power . to win a
word from this amiable girl. 'â¢/ ' . Â¦.Â¦
VThe girls were more than enthusiastic over that clever toast which Miss
Eleanor Davenport gave â¢ at Mrs. Walker's luncheon on Tuesday. It was just
the thing, and so wittingly told. Every one, almost, excepting Dr. Brownell,
the groom-elect, had 'been toasted. -Miss Prince, whose engagement was an
nounced, was showered with good wishes, and a toast was offered the young la
dles present whose engagements will . be announced In the 1 course of time and
love.: Miss Davenport had known Dr. Brownell rather longer than the other
guests, and feeling he should be appreciated, she made a clever little speech
full of wit and delicate humor. . ' ' "r

The two ships to be built for Chile are
to be battleships of 15,000 tons and 22 5
knot speed. Instead of, as first reported
armored cruisers of 22 knots. Although
the contracts have been placed with Els
wick s and v lckers and money deposited

Chilean Legislature which may result in
canceling < the^orders. The condition un

A new system of loading the 13.39-inch
turret guns of the French coast defense
ship Valury is said to have been tried with
satisfactory results. With the old con
trivance only one shot could be fired in
four to five minutes, whereas with the
improvement made , one shot per minute
can be delivered. Starting with Â«uns load
ed, five shots were flred In less than four
minutes.
The trials of the French sea-gclng tor
pedo-boats ; Bourrasque and Rafale con
siderably exceeded the contract require

24.5 tons, displacing 133.3 tons, and made
31.53 knots for one hour. - The Rafale,
carrying 39.2 tons on a displacement of
158 tons, reached a speed of 31.42 knots,
both boats thus exceeding the contract of
30 knots.- The trials consisted in a four
hour run, the first/ hour at a minimum
of 25 knots, the second hour at maximum
speed and Â¦_ the third and fourth of 25

Lord Beresford made a speech at the
annual dinner of the Institution of Naval
Architects in London on March 19. Hi3
closing remarks concerning r the navy
were that he intended that his country
men should know the truth, and he pro
posed to speak out in British towns and
ask the Admiralty. either to contradict his
statements or turn him out of the service
by court-martial. This is pretty strong
talk from an officer. against his superiors,
which has not been tolerated In this coun
try since the days of Admiral I>avld D.
Porter. Rear Admiral Meade and some
others have Indulged in language much
less provocatlng with distastrous results,
and even Admiral Dewey has been
snubbed for falling to agree with the Sec
retary of the Navy.- Discipline Is not so
exacting in monarchlal England as in thÂ»
United States, and it is just possible that
the Admiralty will be forced to give
way to the imepetuoua Beresford, backed
up by public sentiment and desire for re
form. .
The dissatisfaction of the engineer
corps in the British navy, with its posi
tion aa compared with officers of the
sailor branch, has been still further In
creased by an Admiralty order, which
places the Inspection and installation of
auxiliary machinery and electrlcal>av
pliances pertaining to guns and torpedoes
urder the control of line officers. The en
gineers look upon this as an Indication of
hostility upon the part of .the Admiralty
toward the corps, as it does not wish Â»t9
duties,, to. be diminished nor shared: In
vrith others, but rather seek to Increase
their responsibility and attain : an im
proved standing with other officers In tha
navy.
The Diadem, a British cruiser of 11.000
tons, 16,500 horsepower and 20.5-knot
speed, has gone out of commission after
a service of three years eight months.
The ship was completed In July. 1898. at a
cost of $2,774,315. and is now to be re
paired at an estimated cost of $119,395 to
hull proper and about $200,000 for repairs
to machinery and installation of new
boilers.
There are about 12,000 Roman Catholic
sailors In the British navy, yet there Is
not a single sea-going Catholic priest.
The Irish members of Parliament hava
appealed without success thus far for ap
pointment of such. Two priests serve an
chaplains on shore, but their highest pay
is only one-half of that â¢ received by
Anglican chaplains. The London Tablet
refers to this discrimination as being
cruel and absurd, saying: "To the dying
Catholic the presence of the priest means
this tremendous difference between going
into eternity with his sins forgiven or un
forgiven, while to the dying Protestant
his chaplain may talk consolingly, and
that, is all."
The last suggestion of mobilization ad
vises that the Â¦whole war fleet be mobil
ized at an early date to test organization
and discover weak points.
Under the head of organization for war
he advocates that a correct register of
all auxiliaries be kept and "pattern ves
sels" of such auxiliaries are to be in com
mission with service squadrons in peace
time. All -war vessels useless for lack of
speed or fighting capacity to be abolished.
As to reserves, he proposes a register
of skilled mechanics and others, who, in
an emergency, could fill certain ratings
en board ship, such men to be enlisted as
"reservists" and paid a retaining wage.
He would also modify the present syÂ«tem,
having the men join for twelve years, as
now, but a percentage to be permitted to
leave after six years' service.
Lord .Beresford recommends under tha
head of training the securing of *younger
srimirals by the selection of younger com
manders and captains, increase of rear
admirals' list and the retirement on the
retired pay of a vice admiral of such rear
admirals as have passed three years with
out hoisting their flag. He would also
establish exercise squadrons and have tha
army and navy combine In maneuvers
yearly. He also recommends that seaman
gunners, who are first class shots and
Qualified as captain of gun, be paid as
t-killed mechanics.
Under the second head h^ would pro
vide for the purchase of coal fields at
home and in. the. colonies by the Govern
ment, so that supplies for the navy shall
net be affected by strikes, etc. --Â¦
Under the first head he would add to
the Board of - Admiralty a "Naval War
L*>rd," on whom should devolve the or
ganization of preparation for war, and
heads of the various departments, to be
the ablest specialists that the servico
produces, are to be under this official.
Lord Beresford's scheme for naval re
form is quite brief, but comprehensive,
and is summarized under six heads, name
ly: Administration, coal supply, organ
ization for war, reserves, training and
mobilization.
It is the duty of the press of California to expose this scheme to the people, and the
exposure should be repeated over and over again from now until election day. The San
Francisco Supervisors and the League of Municipalities "have done well in issuing the
circular of warning, but the assistance of the press will be required to give the subject the
reiteration necessary to impress the public mind.. None but a corporation organ will refuse
to assist in the work. It is a vital issue, for it is the most drastic as well as the most
brazen scheme ever undertaken by corporations in California to escape public control and
secure themselves the privilege of making such regulations as they choose and imposing
rates as heavy as the traffic can bear. ; : .
This precious scheme provides that all corporations in California shall be under the
supervision and authority of a commission of five persons, who in the first instance are to
be appointed by Governor Gage. One of the appointees of the Governor is toehold office
for two years, another for four years, the third for six years, the fourth for eight years
and the fifth for ten years. Thus the Gage appointees will constitute a majority of the
commission for at least six years to come. . .*"
The effect of the amendment, if carried, will be to destroy local self-government, so
far as regulating corporations is concerned. Under its operation the people of no county
nor city nor town in California will have any control of even such strictly local and neces
sary utilities as water, light and street railways.
By such tactics the corporations managed to win the first' fight for their scheme.
They have adopted similar tactics in conducting the fight before the people. Not one of
them appears to defend the measure. They are even more careful to avoid discussion of it
in public than they were in the Legislature. They are all silent. Even their yellow organ
in the Democratic camp has nothing to say either for or against this "Democratic meas
ure." It is evidently regarded by the yellow journal itself c? a "good joke," and is en
joyed by that paper as much as by. the corporations and their henchmen.
After giving this history in considerable detail, the circular, adds: "It is almost
needless to assert that there was a strong corporation lobby present during these few days.
Every pressure from corporation headquarters and from the machine politicians was ex
erted to prevent its reconsideration." .
The history of the passage of the amendment is one of the most interesting parts
of the circular. It was introduced by Assemblyman Laird of ; Kern County, was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee. When reported to the' Assembly its ';Â¦Â¦. consideration
was not reached until after ip p. m., and the Assembly, having voted -to continue the sesÂ»
sion until the amendment was voted on, it was rushed^through. Itis stated aprbrninent
member quieted the Republicans by informing them it was a corporation "'â¢ measure, intro
duced by a Democrat, and was "the best joke" of the session; and he advised Republi
cans "to keep still and let it go out as a Democratic measur^"â¢;;?;.Thl^s,vas^aÂ¦^result':.oft5he
time of the night, the misrepresentation of the true purpose of the amendment, and : the
fact that it was looked upon as a joke, it was passed by the Assembly.' .A like secrecy was
practiced in the Senate, though it there met with more opposition. No time was . 'given
for a study of the amendment before it was rushed through, and after its passage every
attempt to obtain a reconsideration was defeated.
A joint committee v of the two bodies has issued a circular warning the people of
the danger of adopting the amendment, giving an # elaborate analysis of the various
clauses, and a brief but instructive history of the manner in which it was hurried through
the Legislature. /
The circular sets lorth ten objections to the amendment, as follows:
\ 1. It will increase taxation/ ' Â¦
2. It' makes impossible the securing of any reduction of rates for any pjublic service. â¢ - t
3. It perpetuates the inefficient features of the present Railroad Commission.. v " ':Â¦
4. It destroys municipal ownership of publiÂ« utilities.- â¢ " ... ,~. : ; i s '.
5. It interferes with local self-government. U f *.. .
6. It places inordinate powers in the hands of the present .Governor. â¢ ' ' â¢ 'Â¦' ,
7. It will deprive cities and counties of license fees now paid by public corporations. Â¦;â¢Â¦
8. It takes away from local bodies all control of franchises. .-., -^X,..
9. It establishes a bureaucracy. - â¢ .. . ." \ : 'â¢.Â¦':'â¢ â '
10. It is antagonistic- to a Republican form of government. '
BY THE GALL the attention of the public has Â¦ been repeatedly directed to the
bold corporation scheme embodied in Assembly constitutional _ amendmerit No.
28. It is therefore gratifying that the San Francisco Board of and
the .California League of Municipalities have united in the task of exposing the
evil nature of the measure and defeating it. , y\ . v

COLUMBIA, S. C. April 13.â In the
presence of thousands who came to pay
their last tribute of love and respect the
body ' of "Wade Hampton was buried
in the old; family lot in Trinity Church
yard to-day. Every effort had been made
by the family to have the funeral quiet,
but these who attended the obsequies of
John C. Calhoun, for which preparations
were made by the State for a week, de
clare the demonstration this afternoon
was the greatest. The outpouring of peo
ple was spontaneous. Every railroad lead
ing here. was forced to run special trains.
Veterans, their sons and daughters, mili
tary and municipal officers came .: from
every county in the State. Durnig the
short time to-day the public was per
mitted to enter the Hampton house sev
eral thousand people, including a great
many negroes; passed by the coffin. The
procession included all the organizations,
about 800 militia and the delegation from
schcols and colleges. All *- marched In
double rank and close order, and the line
was a mile and a/half long.
All were on foot except General Hamp
ton's family. Each, of the 100 Daughters
of the Confederacy caried a- floral offer
ing. Besides there were wagon loads of
magnificent flowers.
The procession moved to the church, a
little over a half mile distant, between
rows of people. Some of the houses on
the way had Confederate flags draped in
mourning. - 1 Â¦ '
Seats in the church â¢ could be provided
for but 1700 .people, while perhaps 20,000
were without. . General Hampton's family
servants were provided for within, r Â¦
. Bishop Ellison Capers, assisted by four
pastors, conducted the services. V- In : the
open air the choir. sang during the buria).
Among the mourners was a body, of the
men who first went -to Â¦ the war â¢ with
Hamptonâ members of the Hampton Le
gionâand they carried their shot-torn flag
of Hampton's command.
After, the last ceremony men wearing
the old Confederate gray filled the grave.

The schooner Halcyon, which arrived yester
day, ten days from Grays Harbor, reports that
on April 5, about 100 miles S.W. by W. of the
Columbia River, she passed through a lot of
fresh-cut pine lumber, consisting of timbers
and planks. Later on, on April. 11, she sighted
a three-masted schooner about fifty miles west
of Point Gorda. The schooner was lumber
laden and had evidently been in heavy weather.
Her fore and main topmasts and fore ,tower
masthead had been carried away. She was
bound south. Â¦ ,

LAST TRIBUTE

Newburg Sticks in Mud.
.The schooner Newburs went ashore yester
day morning at the entrance to Oakland Creek.
She : was floated again and sustained no dam
age. Â»- A new mud . bank â¢ has â¢ formed In the
channel leading to Oakland harbor and the
Newburg is by no means the first vessel that
has found It.- It is quite a long time since
the Government was requested to appropriate
funds for establishing daylight ranges to guide
mariners through this intricate and constantly
changing waterway. The local engineers are
doing all they can to hasten Government ac
tion.
In spite of a promise made in the early part
of the ,week, visitors, were not allowed- on
board the battleship Wisconsin yesterday. The
war vessel did not finish coaling until late
Saturday afternoon, and coal dust was too
much in evidence to admit of allowing an in
spection by the public. At. every boathousu
along the beach were holiday makers Â¦ clamor
ing to be taken to the Wisconsin, and the dis
appointment at the order "no visitors", was
keen and widespread. It is understood, how
ever, that the public will be allowed to' In
spect the battleship on Wednesday afternoon
and on the afternoons of â¢ Saturday and Sun
day, if she is then at her anchorage in man
of-war's row. ..-Â¦;.'-Â¦â¢'.'â¢
No Visitors to Wisconsin.
"I shouldn't wonder if you lost 20 cents'
worth of stamps yourself in this' way
every year. Now the population of Great
er New York is approximately 3.50O.UV0.
Supposing that the waste of the sort I am Â¦
talking about averaged 20 cents annually,
the-, total would be something like $7UO,0UO
In Greater New York alone. -You may
think this Is putting it pretty high, and
perhaps it is, for of course a good part
of the population of the city consists of
children, and then there are other' classes
who seldom use stamps, but it is pretty
plain that several hundreds of thousands
of dollars are lost to Uncle Sam in this
city every year in stamps that are paid
for and never used.
"Hot weather used to be responsible for
more gain for the Postoffice Department
than any other one cause. Stamps were
ruined by the thousands because the
gum melted and they stuck to one
another.
"The little oiled paper books of stampa
that are sold now and that are getting to
be so popular have interfered with this
source ot governmental revenue. They
separate the gummed edges so that they
cannot stick together.
"Then there's another practice indulged
in by many advertising and business
firms that puts a good deal of coin Into
Uncle Sam's pocket in the course of every
twelve months, and that's the practice of
sending out unsolicited letters asking for
trade .or patronage of some sort. These
are often accompanied by stamped aad
addressed envelopes for a reply that in
the maiority of cases is never made.
"I suppose, as a mater of fact, not one
tenth of Â¦ them ever elicit replies. Thua
the stamp that has been paid for is not
used and the Government is paid for
work not done. A few business houses
that I. know of collect such envelopes and
redeem them when they have got enough
to make it worth the while, but very few
take the trouble to do this. There aro
thousands of reply postal cards, too, that
are never used.
"Lots of people are careless about ptxtÂ»
ting- stamps on envelopes and pape?
wrappers. The result is that often be
fore the stamp has been canceled it has
fallen oft and the letter Is held up at the
other end of the line until postage is
paid.
â¢ "A great many more folks put on too
much postage. They slap on two 5-cent
stamps to a package that needs only one.
They are too busy or too indolent to take
the trouble to find out whether a pack
age requires 5 or 10 cents postage. It is
amazing how ignorant well educated and
intelligent people often are about such a
common matter ' of information as tho
postal rates for different classes of mat
ter. They pay for their ignorance, too,
and pay well, altogether.
"Of course there is no way In which to
tell just how much money la wasted in
these different ways, but It must be plain
after what I've said that it's a pretty
big fortune every year. The beauty of It
is that the Government always gets the
i benefit of. any mistakes. If too little
postage is put on a letter Uncle Sam sim
ply holds it up until' the difference is
paid. If too much is put on. Uncle Sam
simply pocket3 the excess, to which he is
not entitled, and says nothing."
"I don't think it can be saying too
much to say that Uncle Sam is much
more than Jl.OOO.OCO in pocket every year
as a result of carelessness in the use of
stamps. The Government never loses
anything by such carelessness, and . Â»l
ways gains.
"How many do you put loose in a
drawer of your desk or in a corner of
your pocket-book or wallet and never
think of again until you come across
them, aged and decrepit, while rummag
ing about months later?* Of course, no
body ever thinks of even trying to re
deem such stamps. They couldn"t if they
tried it.
"Considering the American instinct for
the acquirement of dollars, and the fact
that stamps are as good as money in th:.i
country, it is hard to understand just
why such a huge amount of money is lit
erally thrown away every year by wast?
ing stamps.
"Maybe you think I'm exaggerating the
truth when I say huge sums, but that's
just because you are not in a position to
see what goes on. Neither am I person
ally, but stamps are in 'my tine, and Â£
take pains to ask the delivery superin
tendent and the receiving clerks a few
things occasionally, and what they tell
me Is astonishing.
"Foreigners tell me that we Ameri-,
cans are just about the most wasteful
people on the face of the round earth,"
said a stamp clerk in an up-town branch
postal station the other day, "and I guess
that is about the case. I know it's so. if
we waste other things the way we do
stamps. '

Profit.

. In spite of the expensive dredging operations
conducted by the Harbor Commissioners at
Channel street, .navigation in that part of the
harbor in still fraught- with danger and de
lay. The inside of the mud bank has been
dredged out/ but the State dredging depart
ment-has left a ship trap at the entrance of
the narrow waterway, which catches and holds
for varying spells nearly, every vessel that has
business in the bay wharf district. The steam
er Arctic is still a fixture in the mud and only
the vigorous efforts of a lusty red-stack tow
boat saved the schooner Halcyon from a sim

Nothing is more annoying to men j or
women of middle, age when they notice
that their hair is growing thinner, . when
they must admit that the first indications
of baldheadedness have commenced to ap-
pear. Many would give a thousand dol-
lars and more for a remedy with which,
to preserve their natural head-dress.
However, they don't need to. Newbro's

-About forty bartendera attended services
in a Cleveland church on a" recent Sunday
The afternoon game was ten Innings of
fast and exciting ball* The locals pound
ed Schmidt for three runs . in the first
Inning, which score the Oaklanders tied
tn the second inning-. From that point
LOS ANGELES, April 13.â Los Angeles
won two games from Oakland to-day.
Both were notable for unusual and ex
citing features. In the morning game
McPartlin's pitching and the heavy bat
ting, fast base-rurmlrig and clean fielding
' ot the locale were the features. Not a
single hit did McPartlin allow the Oak
land men, and only once did a man get
farther than second base. Reilly drove
the ball over left field fence for a home
run and Anderson put one under
right filed fence a few moments
later, scoring two runs. Anderson
made his debut behind the bat and
caught the fancy of the crowd by his
quickness in throwing to second and his
iieavy stickwork. .

the first half of the tenth a single, a two
bagger and two errors by the Los An

changed quickly, however, when the lo
cals came to bat. Anderson sent a cork
ing two-bagger against center field fence
and scored on Toman's clean single. Han

The Smith brothers. Grant and Chester,
again won the Davis cups yesterday, by
virtue of which victory the trophies goto
them permanently. The winners have
played together in these tournaments but
five times, winning the last four consecu
tively. It .was expected they would meet
Collier and Crowell on even terms, but as
the latter seemed willing to give a handi
cap of "owe half fifteen" the Smith bro
thers were none the less willing to take it,
although expecting to play them even.
These two teams drew each' Other in the
preliminary round and the best match of
the day resulted. It would have been a
much better match had there been no
handicap. The majority of the spectators
were of the opinion the Smiths would
have won without receiving any odds.
The ending of 'Â¦ the tournament was
rather unsatisfactory, as Strlngham and
Whipple were .unable to play in the finals
and defaulted to the tournament winners.
It was the opinion of the spectators that
the former should have defaulted in the
preceding round and allowed their oppo
nents, Beal and Kenyon, to play in the
final.
In the first round Dick Adams and
James MacKenzie allowed Clyde Beal and
Al Kenyon odds of "half thirty" and were
beaten, 2-0, 6-2, 6-2. Frank Strlngham and
George Whipple allowed A. Worthington
and Dr. Noble "one-half thirty" and won
in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. Dr. Lane and G.
Ptfnnett won from Frank Hopper and
Charles Kuehn, 6-3, 6-L Grant and Chet
Smith received odds of "owe half fifteen"
from Harold Crowell and William Collier
and won In straight sets, 7-5, 6-L The first
set was close, but at no time were the
winners in danger of losing.

The schooner Lurline, the sloop Hal
cyon and The Challenger went out for a
cruise in the channel, where they met
smooth water and a good breeze. W. G.
Morrow, captain of The Challenger, is Just
now too busy with his election as a Trus
tee of Sausallto to take much Â¦ time for
sailing, but \ with the exception of himself
and ex-Commodore W. N. McCarthy, all
the crew of The Challenegr were out on
her. After rounding Presidio Shoal buoy
the crew had a little practice in setting
a spinnaker. Frank Stone's sloop Presto
was also cruising in the channel yester
day, but the boats did not come near
enough to have a trial of speed. The
Challenger behaved splendidly, moving
rapidly, with little fuss, and coming about
with surprising quickness. Her crew is
made up of W. G. Morrow, captain; ex-
Commodore W. N. McGarthy, Commodore
R. S. Bridgman, Vice Commodore A. C.
Lee, J. R. Savvey, C. F. Austin and J. C.
Cockerill. Thei live last' named and sev

'At the conclusion of the scheduled , con
tests yesterday Mrs. A. M. Shields, wife
of the well-known trap shot, delighted the
members of the Golden Gate Club by
showing how skillfully a lady can handle
a gun and grass bluerocks. She fired ten
shots at the swiftly flying, clay pigeons
and succeeded in breaking every one.
Next Sunday the Union Gun Club will
pepper bluerocks at Ingleside. The event
of the day will be a contest for the hand
some Shields cup. The entries in this
race will be so handicapped that the poor
shot will have an equal chance with his
more skilled opponent.
Only -two of the,3hooters were able to
break j twenty-five consecutive bluerocks,
and as a result only two gold bars were
won yesterday. One of these was carried
off by Nauman, while W. J. Golcher cap
tured Ihe other. Silver bars were won by
O. Feudner, Halght and Neustadter. .
The shoot-off of the, tie for the gold cup
between FredrFeudner and Edgar Fors
ter, held over 'from last month, resulted
in a. victory for the former. ,Thia.match
proved one ' of the most exciting events^
thai has occurred at Ingleside during" the
season.- Feudner won . by but one bird,
his score being 43, while Forster broke 42.
The handsome gold cup now becomes the
property of Fred Feudner. The winner of
the Olympic Gun Club trophy also dis
tinguished himself by making the highest
score in ! the club shoot.
The most important. event of the Golden
Gate Gun Club's trapshooting at blue
rocks yesterday at Ingleside was the con
test for the sliver cup offered by the
Olympic Club. There were fifteen entries
in the race for this trophy. It was won
by Clarence Nauman, who succeeded in
making 4S out of a possible 50. . <

the eftorts of * the ' California Coursing
Committee, ; the '.'governing "body of the
sport on this coast," is* a remarkable one.
Champion Palo Alto, .Sacramento Boy,
Aeolus, Luxor,- Royal Archer and all the
great dogs of the present time will be
oenched in this greyhound section.. More
than- one hundred dogs will be 'benched.
The management has not overlooked the
entertainment -of the children during the
show. Professor Clark- and his troupe of
trained dogs will be in attendance. They
will give two performances on -Wednes
day and Thursday ' and three on Friday
and Saturday.
Fred Mansell of London, England, who
will" judge the Portland' show, will stop
over in this city en route home to see the
local show. He made a trip of 14,000 miles
to judge at Boston and at Portland.
Mrs. Thomas Magee Jr. will; be repre
sented by Â¦ her Boston terrier, Winner,
which captured the special prize at the
Victoria show last week. 'Â¦'
in numbers, but also in; quality.
In. the name of charity the society ladies
have decided to exhibit many rare dogs
which otherwise could . be seen only by
the Intimates of their owners.
THE entries ,for the' sixth annual

McHale's work in the left territory was
good to look upon. He had five put-outs,
none cf them easy, and he covered as
much ground as the Palace Hotel. He
also lined out two singles with the willow.
Shugart did some pretty work around the
third bag. Whalen's control of the ball
was unusually good. Chimmie got hit by
a pitched ball and somebody rang for the
ambulance. However, it was not needed,
as Jimmy soon got right again. The socre:

Wagner was the only Senator to regis
ter. In the third act he walked, was sac
rificed to second by Graham and hiked
over the route on Hickey's drive to right
field. Delmas got the ball and it seemed
he could have thrown Wagner out at the
plate. Instead he threw to second and
the little fielder was safe.
Hickey. the strapping left-hander from.
Uie Northwest, was there with the curves
ind shoots for Sacramento. He was er
ratic and wild and the men behind him
*ere .as full of errors as a. summer hotel
s of society belles. The Ponies got seven
runs on six hits, this fact alone fully ex
plaining why Mike ran second. The Ponies
played with a clean error column, their
a-ork being snappy and fast. They prob
tbly would have made it a shut-out if
Oelmas had taken a caance in throwing
iVagner out at the plate in the third. As
.t was, there is nothing to complain of,
lor Delmas probably had a soft spot in his
oeart and could not bear to see Fisher
leave town without some token of hospl
'.ality.
Hoilr started the doings in the second.
He rapped out a three-bagger into the
;rowd at left field and soon scored on the
;hrow-in of Shugart's fly to right field.
The bell announced the arrival of three
more in the fourth, when hits by Nordyke
and Leahy, a brace of errors and a balk
oy Hickey did the trick.
' The linal three were rounded up during
the next explosion. The Senators forgot
qotv to play ball and imagined they were
indulging in the exhilarating sport known
is ping-pong. Consequently Holly. Nor
flyke and Shugart swelled the tally, Shu
gari doing effective work with a two
sacker to the left garden. Errors figured
notably in the play, more so than hits.
Xearly 10,000 people packed the stands
md bleachers, and an overflow meeting
R-as held in left field, where several hun
ired more gathered to witness the little
tet-to. It was all 'Frisco. They outbatted
ind outfielded the Lawmakers. Chimmie

ANOTHER STAKE
FOR A. J. MARTIN
YoungGreyhound Scores
a Sensational Win
on the Field.
P. J. Reilly's Honesty Wins
From Tyrone Prince .at
Union Park. -
The slashing young, greyhound A^ J.
Martin, from the Alameda kennels, car
ried off the honors In the special stake
at Union Coursing Park yesterday, de
feating Lost Chord in the deciding course.
The winner was much the faster doff,
but had to show all his speed and all his
cleverness to win, as the hare favored,
his opponent. Martin led well, and took
the 'first turn. He then stumbled, and
before he could get into his stride again;
Lost Chord had possession of thÂ© hare
and quickly scored three points. Whca
it seemed she would surely defeat the 1
to 4 favorite, the latter went around her
and picked up the hare, scoring a sensa
tional kill and winning the stake.
Had It not been for poor coursing kick
three of the Alameda. kennels dogs
would have divided the stake. Melrosa
Lad was retired by Last Chance chief
ly owing to the hare favoring the latter
dog. Marcissus put Merrimac out of
the running by the close score of 6 to 5.
In the open stake P. J. RelHy*s Hon
esty-was returned a winner after run
ning an undecided course with Tyrone
Prince. When they met the second tlmÂ©
Honesty won by a score of 18 to 1." The
hare took the dogs across the field and
then made good its escape.
Tyrone Prince caused the greatest up
set of the -day by defeating Fannie
Hughie In the semi-final round. The
Prince was 6 to 1: in the betting, and won
decisively. \ ~ . Â¦ ., -
McHenry had two undecided courses
with imported Gambit, the stake favor
ite. In the first round, the former win
ning at the third attempt. In the next
round McHenry was so unfortunate as
to have a two-minute course with Kit
tleman, the latter winning. Kittleman
was withdrawn In â¢ the next round. The

at a sparrow and missed.. Then he made
some, remark! about not. missing such a
big sparrow as his companion, and, aim
ing the rifle at him, pulled the trigger.
The result was a report and a scream
from the wounded boy, who fell to the
ground holding; his head in .his hands.
Green saw that he was hurt and - ran oft*
to tell the boy's father, five blocks away.

Charley had shot himself." ,: ../Â¦-Â¦- - ,.

him accidentally. The Green boy says that

been self-inflicted. Besides: the Mains boy
carried an air gun, while the other carried

THE COAST RECORD.
MONTEREY, April 13.â "Uncle Billy"
Armour, an aged resident of Gonzales, in
southern Monterey County, was found
dead in his yard last night by a neighbor.
Armour lived alone, and the circumstances
of his death are unknown. It is believed
death was due to apoplexy. "
Neighbor Finds Aged Man Dead.
LONDON, April 13.â It is impossible to
record any great activity on the Stock
Exchange during, the past week. Neither
the money condition at home nor the
war outlook in South Africa was such
as to encourage speculation or* commit-,
ments. .. '
The Government has been more suc
cessful than usual in keeping the budget
proposals and the new loan programme
secret. If peace comes speedily, to al
low the loan to be predicated on, Trans
vaal revenues, well and good; but if it
becomes nece^ary to create fresh con
sols and if there be an indefinite period
of war ahead, many brokers say they
will put up their snutters and go on a
holiday. Â¦' ' ' :
American securities . did not improve
much here in consequence of the ten
point Â¦ rise in Louisville and Nashville.
The arbitrage houses fear another cor
ner, . and quotations were allowed to
stand points below New York. The fact
that so much â nervousness is shown is
because of the fear that Louisville and
Nashville will suddenly collapse, though
there is a hopeful feeling for the future.
Home rails improved slightly as a com
bined result of peace talk, the announce
ment of the formation of the Yerkes
Lfondon Company and good traffic rela
tions. Mines were very quiet, although
they are ready to boom if favorable
news ia received fro: . South Africa.
BERLIN, April 13.â The past week on
the Boerse was quiet and uneventful. The
first half of the week showed declining
values in all departments, but â¢ an im
provement began Frida" with the more
favorable prospects for peace in South
Africa, Irons and allied shares dropped
generally until Thursday as a result of
the bad annual report of a number of
companies, but the American market re
port brought a slight improvement, and
this was increased by the meeting in Ber
lin for the purpose of organizing a gen
eral syndicate of rolling-mill representa
tives/ - â¢
The threatened coal strike in Belgium
strengthened coal shares. The dividend
otf VI per cent declared by Ludwig Lowe
& Co., as against dividends of 24 per cent
for the last five years, was regarded as
very disappointing, and depressed the ma
chinery section of the market
The ease of money, has grown . more
pronounced, and it is reported that the
Reichbank . intends to buy discounts Id
the provinces at a private rate. The for
eign rates of exchange were strong. Ex
change on Paris reached the gold point,
while .London exchange almost reached
that point.

- LONDON, April- 13.â The British steam
er Kinfauns Castle, Captain Duncan,
which went ashore" off Brightstone. Isle
of Wight, yesterday morning was floated
this morning and has proceeded for
Southampton.
.The' Kinfauns Castle was homeward
bound from the Cape of Good Hope and
had 350 passengers. The vessel's cargo
was lightered yesterday and her passen
gers transferred to Southampton.
:Â« NEW! YORK, April 13.â The Norwegian
steamer Hero, which was drlven'ashore
at the entrance of the Panama canal in
the harbor of Colon in a norther, arrived
In port to-day " in tow â¢ of- the Merritt &
Chapman- wrecking tug Rescue. The
Hero had her rudder frame carried away,
but is otherwise undamaged. The wreck
ing, company floated the steamer to this
port, where she will be repaired. On the
way up from Colon the Rescue stopped
at Havana for coal. The Hero was an
chored off Stapleton, L. I.
fj WASHINGTON, April j 13.â The -United
States enjoys more of , Canadian custom
than' the 'rest of the world put together.'
Attention is. directed to this fact in that
portion of "Commercial Relation of 1901,"
which deals with United States .trade
with Canada, - an' extract of . which was
given out : for . publication by Mr. Emery,
chief of the Bureau of Foreign Commerce,
to-day.. It:lspointed out that so closely
allied are Â¦ trade conditions in' this coun
try < arid : Canada that prosperity or de
pression in the United States immediately
finds echo in j the trade of our northern
neighbor.
â¢In 1877 Great' Britain lost to us her lead
in the matter of goods sent into the Do
minion, 1 and | from that year forward,
with, but . a ; slight interval, this country
has steadily , lengthened . the gap. It is
not as: widely realized as it should be,
says the report, that . Canada is the best
customer we have,. excepting only Great
Britain and Germany. Consul General
Bittinger at Montreal,* in a report on the
subject, says: / ,
The. United' States does more business with
Canada than with the whole of South Amer
ica, as much as with Central. America. Mexico
and the West ! Indies together and ; nearly as
much as with Africa, Asia and Oceanlca. .
Our present tariff policy toward . Canada
causes the building up of great manufacturing
Interests to compete with our own. j If we seek
trade in. other countries, we must not deny
them the opportunity to sell some of their
products to us. Canada wants to send to the
United â¢' States ' her lumber, -wood pulp, hay,
barley, and minerals. The , United ; States con
sumes, more lumber' and -paper than any other
nation in the -world and she should be glad to
admit lumber and wood pulp free. If the
United . States would takeoff the duty on Ca
nadian coal (which could be sold profitably
only to a very limited extent along, our east
ern coast) our coal j would be admitted into
Canada free and our sales of coal in the Do
minion would be double what they are at
present. .
.. As a curious instance of how industries
may be throttled by legislation, Bittinger
relates that the British preferential tariff
enabled British exporters last year to
send to the Dominion woolen goods to the
value of $10,000,000. As they were consid
ered of , better quality than and as cheap
as the home product, many Canadian
mills have been obliged to close down.
, Consul Shepard at Hamilton, in his re
port, calls attention to the interesting
fact that the big dry goods houses of
Canadii send their milliners and modistes
to New York several times a year to ob
serve and copy styles, and have practical
ly turned their backs on ih3 Kuropcan
moaes, loimerly so popular. -

yesterday afternoon, and lost considera
ble weight lugging timbers from one end
cf the Pavilion to the other.
Company M of Oakland is to build the
bridge across an imaginary estuary. The
members of the company came over in
their working clothes and for nearly two
hours struggled with the proposition.
Company D came on the scene and at
tempted to drive oft the bridge builders,
but Company H rallied to the defense and
drove off the attacking force. There was
a clash of steel, a rattling of drums, sev
ersil bugle calls and other little incidents
that serve to portray the life of a soldier.
Dr. Morrissey had his hospital corps
ready and carried off the supposedly
wcunded. ' â¢"â¢;Â¦
The band also evolved some new stunts,
which it proposes to unload on the public
on Friday night. Little Arnold Grazer,

Captain Hopper of Company A, Captain
McCarthy of Company D and Captain
Grimley of Company L had their various
commands on the floor and put them
through a number of intricate evolutions.

was absent, owing to the death on Friday
night of his mother. He expects to be on
hand next Friday night and command his
company.

~',Meri have l created a'purely artificial barrier

Citizenship should be'grounded on ethics. Good
'government depends on law, Its making and its
'administration. , I>ack of interest in municipal

torded an avenue for the admission' of corrup-'

begin his career In the . wardâ rthat Is, provided'
he win his promotion by good service. ' As con
ditions, now exist i the , ward politicians are the
rank and file of the bosses' army. . .
: There are two kinds of bosses â one wcrks for
. money, - while | the - other Â¦ works . for Â¦ office. Both
practically use ".the; same methods. The 'sad
dest, feature 'offUhe -boss system- is Â¦ that* good
and- patriotic men are forced to 'become bosses
or to abjure politics. â¢; The . bosses are contin
ually, at war against good government. : . The
municipal government, .Â¦ however, is the great
est sufferer. 'The city is. the battleground. The

A beautiful day attracted thousands of
people to the park and beach yesterday.
The beach was dotted j with San Francis
co's pleasure seeking population, walking
and- lounging on the sand, the children
taking advantage of the hot weather by
doffing their shoes and stockings i and
wading in the deliciously cool water.'.
The shore below the Cliff House has be
come a regular fakers' row. Dozens of
men guess your weight and sell you foun
tain pens, medicines guaranteed - to cure
any^ ache or. pain and various \ things to
eat and drink, from candy and waffles to
soda^wajer and enchiladas. ,-..- V
The park, with its vast lawns and long
driveways, harbored a great crowd of
restseekers. Although the drive was one
of the largest for weeks the usual run
away 1 was not in evidence.,. The-, tennis
courts are proving the greatest .attraction
to the young , folks that the park affords,^
they being crowded from early morn to
sunset. The Park.. Commissioners' could
not have, placed anything else in the 'old
music stand drive that would have given
as much pleasure 'as do these courts.

The following statement has been issued
by the officers of the reorganized Carpen
ters' Union, Local No. 22. which was re
cently, suspended by the District Council
owing to a dispute with local union 483:
The reorganized ' members of suspended' Local
22 invite the attention of all other carpenters
to the fact that a general decision, dated July.
10,1891, reads: ','AU benefits are , forfeited. by
a suspended .â¢ union . the . same as a suspended
member. A suspended union cannot be enti
tled to any benefits other than those prescribed
for a new union." (See page 36 < ot Â¦ constitu
tion.) ' Â¦ This makes It clear . that Â¦" the '. benefits
resulting from membership where time is a
factor are lost to all who do not transfer. Most
important ' to the older men is the loss of full
membership by all over the age of 60, who are
now in benefit, should they again seek admis
sion- after suspension. . We' cordially ask our
suspended, brothers to avail themselves of -the
opportunity that now offers ; to preserve their
standing in the brotherhood by taking transfers
and joining in time to participate in the elec
tion of permanent officers Tuesday, April IS,
at Turk-street Temple, for the ,-rest of this
term. Â¦ Â¦Â¦._â¢Â¦ ..â¢Â¦Â¦.â¢Â¦Â¦ - -.'Â¦â¢ - â¢Â¦
. The necessity of earning a living precludes
the possibility of reply to the many mlsstate
ments that have appeared' or, may appear. .As
a rule their falsity is so apparent as to carry
their own refutation. - i â¢ '
We are - in and of the brotherhood - and pro
pose to -show that there is something ' in a
name; that we can state and stand by -the
truth, and if necessary make sacrifices for the
maintenance of true unionism as embodied, in
the history and constitution of the brotherhood.
We regret that the czarlike methods' of a
group of men should dissipate the strength of
the Building Trades Council In fratricidal strife
instead of Â¦ directing It to the improvement of
conditions as fh times past. We assure the con
tractors that the character of those in the new
union will stand investigation, as will also our
reports of the number enrolled, which now
approaches 200. * ' ..'
The contractors and public may rest assured
that the line of progress in trades union effort
cannot long be obstructed by people who owe
their prominence to | a very different course
than that they now pursue. No large city has
escaped its . contest between large responsible
rational ' unions, guided by conservative men
forming their \ judgments . free' from local . Influ
ences, and -local unions which, are' liable to be
led into needless strife and policies alike re
pugnant to the sense of justice, and genius of
our common Â¦ country . Â¦ .' â¢"â¢ :. Â¦â¢-..- -Â¦-. â¢â¢ '

Two carloads of Knabe
Grand Pianos have just
arrived arid now await
your choosing.
One hundred Knabe i
I Uprights were already
on exhibition, and these,
with the Grands, make
up the greatest stock of
Knabes (the grandest
piano ever produced)
ever shown on this
Coast.
Kohler & Chase have for
fifty years had the choice of
agencies of every well-known
piano in the world. They
have selected the Knabe for
well-founded reasons. First,
because it is conceded by
every well-versed musician in
the world to be the most
perfect piece of musical
. mechanism ever produced.
Second, because the patron-
age of Kohler & Chase were
people who demanded and
appreciated the best; and,
third, because it was a piano
that could be safely guaran-
teed under EVERY condi-
, tion.
When you come to look at'
the great bargains we are of- â¢
fering on those pianos we'
purchased in Stockton ask to''
see our stock of Knabes, just)
for curiosity. 'r
