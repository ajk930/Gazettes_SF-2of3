PORT DE FRANCE, Island of Martinique, May 13.â The northern section of the island is depopulated. Provisions are needed 'here immediately for ioo,ooo:people[ at St. Pierre for
* sanitary purposes. The stench there from the dead bodies is overpowering. Mont Pelee was still erupting smoke and fire at a late hour last night. Every, praise is given United States Cotisul Ayme. He has worked in
defatigably to succor the survivors. He has bandaged the limbs of the wounded, and has worked without [sleep, and. witltout food. He is now. thoroughly exhausted. Forty persons rescued from the city are now in hospitals here.
It was reported here yesterday from the, British island of Dominica ; that 300 survivors of "the St. Pierre 'disaster/had reached there in canoes. ; . ' .. ' ,

already. While coming to Fort de France the United States tug Potomac picked up a boat containing
five colored men and one white man, whose pockets were filled with coin, and Jewelry, the latter evi

thick, impenetrable black smoke poured
out of the crater and fell with frightful
rapidity upon the city. In a very short
time the whole city was a. mass of ruins.
CKIES OF THE DOOMED.
The waters of the harbor were violently
agitated and everywhere was heard the
sound of failing masts of the shipping and
vessels were seen to overturn and sink or
burst into flames. The cries of the doomed
beings on shore and afloat lasted only a
few moments, when the stillness of death
fell upon the city and the harbor.
Only three vessels of all the shipping in
the harbor withstood the terrible con
vulsion of nature. These were the little
schooner Gabrielie, the Corena and tho
North American.
One of the survivors who was brought
here says he sprang overboard, and
despite injuries received from the falling
lava and ashes succeeded by diving and
swimming for two hours in sustaining
himself until he was picked up by the
French warship Suchet.
Although the volcano's flow had appa
rently diminished somewhat wilen tho

in its purchases.
â¢ In the Navy Department the carefully
planned relief measures were being' car
ried forward systematically and rapidly.
The Buffalo has been ordered to be put
in readiness for immediate use as a food
and supply transport in case it be decided,
to send more supplies' than the Dixie will
carry. Action has not yet been taken
upon Admiral Bradford's suggestion that
water-tenders be sent to Martinique " to
relieve the pressing need for fresh .water.
The admiral is anticipating the acceptance
of the plan and has accordingly tele
graphed to Pensacola and Norfolk to have
the tenders at those places made ready
for immediate service. The admiral also
has tendered the use of his coal navy aa
food and passenger transports. The equip
ment bureau, of which he is the head ?
has* a small but excellent fleet of large
colliers and the admiral has suggested to
Secretary Moody that these ships are val
uable by virtue of their great carrying
capacity, excellently adapted to relief
work. Each of the ships carries from two
to three thousand tons of supplies.
MANY GENEROUS OFFERS.
There are no lack of spontaneous offer
ings from all parts of .the . country. To
day a telegram was received from the
Pittsburg Chamber of Commerce asking
the State Department if private contribu
tions would be received and how they
should be addressed. Similar messages
came from other points. The department
has as yet made no .response.
An original suggestion came from a
New York commercial house in the shape
of a letter proffering 1,000,000 pounds of
rice at cost price and -<duty free to the
Government., The owners explained that
they were able to make this offer by rea
son . of the fact that the rice is still in
bond.
. 'Â¦ It appeared by noon that so rapidly had
the Government's agents worked that al
ready the War Department alone had
sent over $100,000 of the relief appropria
tion.
â¢ It appears that that part of the joint
resolution adopted yesterday requesting
the President to ascertain to what extent
our aid would be . acceptable to France
had been anticipated by the French Gov
ernment. The President's statement that
that. Government had requested that ships
be supplied to carry away/ the survivors
of the catastrophe in Martinique was at
first supposed to be based upon the state-'
ment of the Governor of Martinique to
United States Consul Ayme. It appears,
however, , that the request came directlv
from the French Government through
Embassador Cambon, who personally pre
sented the matter to the President

BgL ' ~J Roosevelt's measure of relief
for the stricken people of Mar

prevail. The . Senate to-day
passed another bill increasing the total
appropriation to $500,000. This bill has
now gone *o the House Committee on Ap
propriations, and Chairman Cannon said
to-night that If it was found to-morrow
or the day following that this increase
was necessary, the House would ''Â¦ act
promptly. |
Meanwhile, at 4:40 this afternoon Presi
dent Roosevelt signed the bill passed by
both branches of Congress yesterday ap
propriating $200,000 as a relief fund, and
that sum is now available for immediate
use. '
Senator Cullom, chairman ! of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, to which
was referred the President's message urg
ing- an appropriation of half a million
dollars, reported a bill to-day appropriat

passed yesterday. This was .the result of
various conferences : between the : Presi

PLEA OF THE PBESIDENT.
The President told them that so far as
official advices go they show that 1 the dis

two islands had been practically wiped
out of existence; that thousands of people
had. been already killed and, thousands. of
others were stfll - in danger; that ' $100,000
had already been spent in hastening relief
to i .the stricken people and that if the
United States was to : do its duty fully

than the 1200,000 appropriated by Congress
yesterday. .>:Â¦â¢ v ' -'Â¦,-
Senators who talked with the President

to-nightby leading members of the House
that it was doubtful if the bill : would be
passed.. by. the HoUseHo-morrow. It now

ARBADOES, May 13.â When I

M II city was a heap of smoldering
-as^sT ruins.- Thousands' of corpses
Â§3 Iw were strewn on every side,
ffi having been destroyed by the
great volcanic bomb. Tho
cathedral clock was standing at 10 min
utes after 7 o'clock in a solitary tower.
This shows the time when the awful rain
of flre began. It rained flre for twenty
minutes, when every part of the city was
ablaze, and the shipping In the harbor
sunk. The Government, thinking all
danger-over after the eruption of lava to
a height of 120 feet on May 5, formed a
cordon of soldiers around the city to pre
vent residents from . leaving. To further
allay excitement the Governor took up
his residence with several scientists in
St. Pierre.
Not a single person in St. Pierre when
Mcnt Pelee exploded escaped. It will
take thousands to dig out and bury the
dead. The smell of burning flesh is per

The sun rose clear over St. Pierre at 6
o'clock on the morning of May 8." Mont
Peiee was smoking 1 to the north and the
wind was blowing westward.. A few min
utes before 7 o'clock a . great white
column of what seemed to be steam and
gas belched forth from an apparently
new crater on Mont Pelee, which seemed
to be about two hundred yards from the
original crater and which appeared- -to
open up a deep rent from the top to the
bottom of the mountain.
This, outbreak caused the utmost con
sternation and panic among the inhabit
ants of St. Pierre, who fled toward the
seashore, uttering frightful screams, in
anticipation evidently of what was to fol
low. Those on the Gabrlelle observed a
small steam yacht leave St. Pierre at
ten minutes past 7 o'clock with the Gov
ernor and members of a scientific commis

May 13.â The transatlantic

brings this account of an
event preceding the disaster at St. Pierre,
and also of the catastrophe itself, as told
by eye-witnesses \who were on the
schooner Gabrielle:
A scientific commission, , presided over
by the Governor, M. Mouttet, assembled
in St. Pierre on May 7, the day before
the calamity, for the purpose of studying
the phenomena of the volcajiic disturb
ances of Mont Pelee. It was agreed by
the members of this commission that
the relative positions of the craters and
the valleys debouching on the sea were
such that the scientists could affirm that
the security of St. Pierre .was complete,
and this announcement was made to allay
the fears of the frightened citizens. . â¢

HILADELPHIA, May 13.â Speaking of the disaster at St. Pierre, Prof 'essor s 'Aiigelo Heilprin, the noted geologist, says: "That' part of Martinique which hasbe^co^B'wi^^&Mg lava will retnain barren rock for centuries,
jTJjfjcf it will take almost as long for decay to start in the cinders which have been spread on other parts of the island. Vntil that shall happen there will be no soil on .'which the former luxuriant vegetation could take root. It would not
~ be surprising if the great overflow of lava from ihc volcano left so great a cavity underneath the cnist that the volcano itself fell in and disappeared, or even the zvhole island itself sank out of sight beneath the sea. It zvas pushed up
from underneath the surface of the water in the first place by volcanic disturbances, and then built up of lava and cinders by subsequent eruptions" ' Â¦ Â¦

The scenes in and around Sheridan to
day were pitiful in the extreme. Nearly
every house in the village had an injured
Inmate, and in many home3 mourning:
families were gathered about the charred
and distorted remains of victims of the
calamity. Many children were caught by
the flames yesterday, and as a result the
two public school buildings to-day were
almost deserted. Of the 700 pupils en
rolled, but 200 were in attendance at the
sessions to-day. Of the '500 absent. Pro
fessor Hannum estimates that 100 were
Injured. The children have started a fund
for the aid of their unfortunate school
mates, . some of whom are in naed of
financial assistance.
The damage to property by the ex
plosion will probably be heavy. The loss
at the mouth of Cork's Run tunnel alone
will probably exceed $100,000. In addition
to the heavy loss by the railroad com

by the fire which followed.

WASHINGTON, ' May 13.â Hugh Kelly

Cuban sugar-growing, was before the

sugar-growers would.be the beneficiaries

the sugar-mill owners would not benefit
from the reduction, except in cases where
they owned the land.- He- showed' that
many Americans owned sugar. lands in
Cuba, but declared that few options were
now accepted by Cubans because they
wanted to make sales outright if at all.
He said sugar-growing had not â¢ been
profitable of late. years because of the
low price of . the product and the high
price of labor, workingmen receiving a
dollar a day in gold. He discussed at

"The next day the mandarins were exe
cuted by the rebels and the town formally
taken over. All who resisted were killed.
Printed pamphlets were issued and posted
in public places, which bore the rebel
propaganda. An exact translation is as
follows:
A Chinese banker, in an interview at
Hongkong, after a tour of Kwangsi, says
that thirty towns have been captured and
that the rebellion will assume tremendous
proportions.
"The first inkling we had of the move
ment," said he, "was when I went to a
small town on the West River, called
Ping Nam, from my headquarters at Shek
Sing last February. On my return I
found Shek Sing in the hands of the reb
els, led by one Kwok. It appears that one
day forty men disguised as opium mer
chants came Into the town and said they
were travelers passing through. Toward
evening more arrived, and during the
night some hundreds were in the city,
which was completely in their hands.
They captured the local mandarins, seized
the banks, including mine, and threw
open the prison and liberated the prison-'
ers.
THIRTY TOWNS ARE TAKEN.
While this rebel army was gaining vic
tories in Kwangtung the Kwangsi rebels
fell upon a brigade of Marshal Su's
troops, reinforced by a brigade of Anhui'
troops under Chin, Taotai of Kao Lien
Clung. Victory went to the Chingchou
rebels under Kwok, who lost 300 men, ]
while the imperialists had 1200 killed. The I
rebels killed the wounded after the Gov- j
ernrnent troops fled. i
In the two Kwangs and the Yun Kwel
provinces the rebels, numbering 120.000
men. have ' artillery and modern war mu
nitions besides fully 90,000 Mauser maga
zine rifles. The rebels outnumber the im
perial troops by seven to one. They have
possession of all the trade routes to the
interior in the two Kwangs and have
captured large quantities of supplies
destined for the various military garri
sons in the interior, which are cooped up
and dare not leave the cities.
At Huichoufu a detachment of 'Liu
Wung Fu's famous Black Flags -was sent
against the rebels. This force was sig
nally defeated, being cut to pieces In an
ambush. The survivors at once joined
the insurgents. Another force of 2000
Black Flags was dispatched against the
rebels, but, probably being in sympathy
with the rebellion, fled from the field,
leaving the civil mandarins to fall intj
the hands of the enemy. The mandarins
were tortured and beheaded.
MANDARINS ARE BEHEADED.
All was bustle and warlike preparation
at Nanning when Mr. and Mrs. Landis
left there. The water front was lined
with shallow draught gunboats, in which
the imperial authorities were dispatching
soldiers and their ponies up and down the
river to meet the rebels. Couriers were
continually arriving, telling of rebel suc
cesses and of the growth ot numbers. The
walls, of Nanning were being strength
ened, artillery mounted in places and
other preparations made for defense.
The greatest excitement was occasioned
by the return of the defeated Black Flags
after the battle with the rebels at Chun
Shan Hui. They had lost 1000 of their
number and West River was thick with
the dead. When the stragglers returned
with the wounded and several prisoners,
who were publicly beheaded at the mar
ket place, the Taotai advised the foreign
ers and missionaries to leave Nanning,
and many started, including those who
reached here by the Empress to-day. Rev.
Louis Byrde and family were among
other fugitives.
NANNING AWAITS ATTACK.
Mr. and Mrs. Landis of the Christian
and Missionary Alliance were stationed at
Nanning, which Is now being besieged by
the rebels. They were asked to leave the
Kwangsi city after the massacre at Chun
Shan Hui, where the insurgents slew
more than 1000 of the imperal troops.
They fled in a boat, which was
manned by some Chinese ; converts,
down West River, .. and had many
hairbreadth escapes during the voyage to
Canton, whence they made their way: to
Hongkong and there embarked on the Em
press of India. They were fired upon sev
eral times. Many refugees came down
West River with these arrived mission
aries, those from above Nanning bringing
with them news of their sufferings at
the hands "of the rebels. One French
priest was known to have been murdered,
and it was feared that other mlsionarles
lost their lives. ' .

Haldeman was born at Maysville, Ky.,
April 21, 1821, and was educated at Mays

and others of note. In 1844 he started the
Daily Dime paper, which was soon con

Haldeman being a Confederate sym
pathizer. The Courier soon appeared at
Bowling Green, Ky.. and then at Nash

Haldeman resumed the publication of the
Courier in this city, until 1868, when, in
concert with Henry Watterson, of the

and appeared as the Louisville Courier-

the same management.

the two excited women and he breught
them, down to police headquarters. De
tectives. Bell and Reynolds were detailed
on the case and together with, the women
went at once to the ferry in hopes of in
tercepting the fugitive. He was not
found, and a search of the Overland train
at the Oakland mole was . likewise fruit

trace of the missing man had been se

Between 5 and 6 o'clock last evening
Marco came to the house and after greet
ing Mrs. Klein, who was sitting in Mrs.
Majors' apartment, proceeded to the room
occupied by â¢ himself and Mrs. Klein.
She went into this room shortly after
ward and , discovered the bed in disorder.
A hasty search disclosed the fact that the
money and jewelry were missing, and fur
ther examination showed that the thief
had made his escape through the rear, of
the house. Â¦
The fact tfiat Mrs. Klein had a large
sum of money was known to Marco and
to Mrs. Majors, the landlady. The latter
advised Mrs. Klein in the morning to de
posit the money in some bank, but Mar
co said there was no hurry about it.
KNEW SHE HAD MONEY.
She arrived in the city Sunday, having
nearly $7000 In cash and some Jewelry. .
She occupied the same room as Marco,
and according to her story, the under
standing was that they were to be:mar

consisting of $3000 in $100 bills and $3800 in
bills of small denominations was placed'
between the Â¦, mattresses of the bed

The palace in which were former Presi

and residence of General Vilbrun. former
Secretary of War, were attacked last
night by revolutionists under the leader
ship of General St. Foix Colin. The at
tack on the palace was repulsed after one
hour of fighting. One man was killed and
many wounded. Former President Sam
was protected by the Presidential Guard.
General Vilbrun managed to elude the
revolutionary citizens, who fired upon his
residence, and sought refuge In the
French legation, where also the former
Minister of Finance found an asylum.
General Defly was forced to evacuate the
arsenal and fled to the palace. General
Sam early this morning sent a messenger
to the palace, as he wished to place him
self under the protection of the diplomatic
corps. The former President feared an
cttack upon his person, .as the revolution
try citizens Were at first determined either
to drive him and his Cabinet from Port
an Prince or to take more severe action.
General and Mrs. Sara were removed in a
carriage with the United States and
i-Yench Ministers. Later General and
Mrs. Sam and the former Haytian official^
went aboard a French vessel to sail for
France. The action of Minister Powell
end other members of the diplomatic
corps greatly relieved the situation, but
there is still intense though suppressed
excitement in the city.

The new Legislature will select a Presi
dent of the republic. There is a. rumor
that General Jumeau is marching on the
capital in the interest of M. Alexis ' or
General Firmin, two candidates for the
Presidency. If such is the case serious
trouble may arise. The southern part of
the republic is opposed to the election of
a northern man as President.
A Haytian gunboat has fired alarm guns
and put to sea. Her destination and the
purpose of her departure have not been
disclosed. Late rumors are to the effect
that General Firmin has been proclaimed
Et Cape Haytien President of the re

Firmin.
WASHINGTON. May 13.â Hayti is In
the throes of a revolution. The insurgent
army is in control. Secretary Hay re
ceived this afternoon a dispatch from
Powell, Minister at Port au Prince, which
reads:
"The Chambers have been closed by a
mob. Much firing' ensued and one Deputy
was mortally wounded. The populace at
tacked the palace and arsenal last night.
Several were killed and wounded. The
diplomatic corps embarks the President
to-day. The Minister for Foreign Affairs
and the Minister of War have taken
refuge in the American legation. Firmin,
with his army, is marching on Port au
Frince. Great excitement prevails at
Port au Prince and business is suspended
for the present."
GUNBOAT WILL SAIL.
Secretary Hay referred a copy of Pow
elTs message to the Secretary of the
Navy, with a request that a. warship be
ac once dispatched to Haytian waters.
Accordingly orders were telegraphed to
the gunboat Topeka to sail as soon -as
possible for Port au Prince. She will leave
Saturday.
Some regret is expressed that Powell
should have received the two Haytian
officials in his legation. The United
States has always deprecated the practice
of its legations being made a refuge of
representatives of a Government which
has been overturned. It is feared that
some embarrassment may arise with the
revolutionary authorities, but It is said
that the men v.ill certainly not be sur
rendered if there is any danger that they
â¢will be executed.

sued a.n address to the people, referring
to the unexpected abandonment of power
by President Sam and the rejection of

TACOMA. May 12.â Within thirteen
iconths 2009 natives along tlie coast of
Alaska have been vaccinated as a pre
ventive of smallpox by the surgeon of
the revenue cutttr Rush, and It is be
lieved that the 'prompt action and the
thoroughness with which the duty was
performed had the effect of keeping that
scourge out of Southeastern Alaska. With
the exception of a few cases on Hooniah
Island, th-e disease .has not made its ap
pearance, though the previous year It
raged with great severity among the
natives along the coast for a thousand
miles. The Rcsir will continue the vac
cination of the natives during the com
ing seatson, for -which purpose more th3ii
1000 vaccine points have been shipped to
her at Sitka. Licuteant WInram, her
executive officer, says:
"We did the work systematically and
ircculated the arms of all Indians we
could find last fall, except those on the
island of Hooniah, who at the time we
called happened to be away on their an
r.ual excursion to the berry patches.
Afterward smallpox made Its appearance
on this island, but we went there without
delay and soon had the disease stamped
out. Aside from this, there has not been
a case in all the lower part of the. Ter
ritory, which has led us- to believe that
there is some merit in vaccination as a
preventive."

"As for myself," said he, 'I will say I
have less use for the United States army
than I ever had before, because of the
way I was treated."
Senator Beveridge created a flurry by
asking the witness if he had talked with
any Senator since he was last on the
stand. Senators Patterson and Carraack
vigorously objected to what they termed
an uncalled-for reflection on the minority.
"When there is an imputation made by
me it will be made directly," answered
Senator Beveridge. The "witness declared
that he had talked with no members of
the committee and the matter was closed.
After the committee adjourned several
members decided to sample the canned

the view to ascertaining whether It is

was because a certain order by General

executed and this made the natives bold
in their resistance.-
It needed an order such \ as General
Smith gave - to- make the natives realize
that the United States meant business.
He said the men. in the Philippines knew
that "war was hell" and the ooys "were

Frost admits writing the letter,- but de

declares the letter to have been solely

in convicting and sentencing-, and that
Frost is absolutely innocent of anv

Marshal Vawter is declared to have
been "actuated by a malicious and vin

In the opening statement of the docu

S. FROST, who was
fl serving a sentence of one year in
Wthe county jail of Alameda, Im
posed bv the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for con
tempt growing out of the mine-jumping
scandals at Nome in 1900, was released
from imprisonment yesterday by order of
the President.
News of his good fortune came to Frost
in the form of the following telegram
from Washington .to Sheriff Rogers; of
Alameda County, signed by" Attorney Gen^
eral Knox:
The President has pardoned Claude A. S.
Frost, i'ou may release him immediately.
Formal warrant of pardon, signed by Presi
dent, by mail to you. Answer.
The pardon was not unexpected and
Frost was not a whit surprised, though
expressing his pleasure that he should be
released after suffering such a short im
prisonment. He entered the prison on
March 7 and had, considering the credits
that would have followed good behavior,
eight months more to serve. He began
packing his things immediately, with the
help of a fellow-prisoner, and two hours
after the receipt of the telegram he was
free.
"I don't want to stay behind those bars
any longer than I can help," said Frost,
while he was busily placing his clothes
and other belongings into trunks and
packing cases. "1 want to breathe the tree
air again. Two months is long enough,
tout a year. is a good deal' longer, and I
am giad the pardon came along as it did.

Seme Facts Made Kno\rn.
It Is often thought that grocers really
have very little care regarding the food
value of the articles they sell, but the
real facts are that grocery keepers of the
right sort are extremely particular as to
what they recommend.
One of the fraternity relates a tale:
â¢The highest priced coffee on the market
I introduced to my customers and used
myself. I began to have bilious attacks
and after a little observation attributed
them directly to coffee. Every time I
left off drinking it I got better, but I felt
the need of a warm drink for breakfast.
"Along In" '96 a wholesale grocer ! urged
me to put in some Postum Food Coffee
in my store, which I did with considerable
misgiving, for at that time the now fam-
ous Postum was not bo well known.
"He urged me to try it myself, which I
did and was disgusted with the flat,
tasteless beverage, so was my wife. I re-
rntmbered the wholesale grocer said
something about following directiona
carefully, so I took Â«the package anl
studied it. I at once discovered that we
had not boiled It long enough, only three
or four minutes, but it must be boiled fif-
teen minutes at least, so we tried it
again, with the.result that we got a per-
fect cup of coffee, a delightful and health-
tul beverage. I have continued the use of
Posturn in my home ever eince. We use
it for breakfast, dinner and supper.
"My bilious attacks quickly left and I
am free from them altogether. I began
to explain to my customers something of
the value of . Postum Coffee and now
have a very large trade on It." Name

blow for the father and husband. Â¦
Marius returned to Tahiti on the steam

St. Pierre Madame Marius presented him
with twins. The mother had recoyered
her health, and when Marius left her and
the five children she was looking forward
with pleasure to enjoying a long stay In
the land of her childhood.
Three children were born to the couple
at Tahiti. Madame Marius' health began
to fail last year, and in October. Marius
secured a leave of absence from the
French Government and accompanied his
wife and children to Martinique. . They
arrived here last October and 1 spent sev
eral weeks in this city. They went to
the West Indies by way of Paris In the
hope that the variety of scene and change
of climate would benefit the health of the
sick woman.
Marius is a native of Martinique. It
was in St. Pierre that he met and mar

"This American region of weakness ex

WASHINGTON. D. C, May 13, 1902.
A. Ebarboro. San Francisco. CaL
The President has appointed you a. member
survivors subsides. It is remembered
that while Mont Pelee -was threaten
ing and giving warning of the dis
aster it was about to work, the Gov
ernor refused to permit any general
exodus from St. Pierre, following the
advice of a meeting of scientists,
who on Hay 7 declared there was no
danger from Mont Pelee.
FAMIETE CONTINUES.
Some food has been brought here from
neighboring islands, but famine still con
tinues to threaten the refugees. All are
on half rations and when it is remem
bered that pestilence is an Immediate
menace it can be understood' why there
shouid be plenty of food to give those who
may be attacked strength to fight the
disease.
Vandalism has already begun at St.
Pierre, and although soldiers are trying
to guard the dead looting is going on in
a shameful manner.
Announcement will soon be made pro
viding severe penalties for all v.ho are
caught stealing on the island.
The Potomac, a United States Govern
ment tug sent from San Juan, Porto Rico,
which arrived here to-day, brought in five
siegroes and one white man who had been
picked up in a small boat off St. Pierre.
All of these men were loaded down wiih
jewelry, which had been taken from the
bodies in St. Pierre. The prisoners were
turned over to the French authorities for
punishment. The Potomac brought a ton
of supplies to Martinique, consisting in
part of codfish and flour. While off St.
Pierre the Potomac encountered a column
of thick smoke, through which she could
not pass. The tug was compelled to go
five miles out of her course to escape the
ashes that were falling in clouds.
BEADY TO RETREAT.
In the harbor of St. Pierre a steamship
Is in constant readiness to take away
the workers if Mont Pelee becomes more
threatening. A watch is constantly main
tained, ready to give warning, and if the
lava turns in the direction of St. Pierre
the place will be immediately deserted.
Aside from those working in the ruins
there is not a human being in the north
ern part of the island. All who have not
been killed have fled to Fort de France.
As a result of the measures taken by
the authorities, access to St. Pierre Is
now easier. The ruins of the town have
ceased smoking. Two thousand corpses
have been found in a carbonized condi
tion.
Talk with survivors of the disaster con
firms the statements as to the awful sud
denness of the catastrophe. It is thought
that a large quantity of gas -was released,
producing great atmospheric pressure,
which overwhelmed everything before it.
The gases absorbed by the bodies of the
victims caused them to burst, and the
lire coming afterward carbonized them.
This was followed by a rain of stones,
which enveloped the town, but there was
not, as has been said, any flow of incan
descent lava.
TORNADOES OF FERE.
A gardener at the village of Morne
Rouge, seven kilometres distant from St.
Pierre, saw at the moment of the disaster
seven luminous points on Mont Pelee. He
says he had the impression of being vio
lently drawn toward the \olcano by a
powerful current of air. Then the moun
tain opened, according to the descrip
tion of the gardener, and flung tornadees
of fire at St. Pierre.
Many strange and incomprehensible in
cidents are recounted of St. Pierre. The
charred remains of a woman with a silk
handkerchief, unburned and in perfect
condition, held to her lips, have been
found there. Tne crisped bodies of young
BJMf have been found, but the shoes they
wore were unhurt.
In addition to the specie already se
cured, jewels to the value of 1,000,000
francs were rescued from the bank of St.
Pierre yesterday. The Italian Consul at
Barbadoes has recovered the body of his
daughter, who was visiting in St. Pierre
at the time of the disaster. "Margaret
Stokes, the nine-year-old daughter of the
late Clement Stokes of New Tork, who
with her mother, a brother aged four and
a sister aged three was on the ill-fated
British steamer Roraima, is in the hospi
tal here. The child is not expected to
live. Her nurse, Clara King, tells the fol
lowing story of her experience:
SEES CLOUD COINING.
She says she was in her stateroom when
the steward called out to her, "Look at
Mont Pelee." She went on deck and saw a
vast mass of black cloud coming down
from the volcano. The steward ordered
her to return to the saloon, saying, "It is
coming." Miss King then rushed to the
scJoon. She says she experienced a feel
ing of suffocation, which was followed by
intense heat. The after part of the
Koraima broke out in flames. Benson, the
carpenter of the Roraima, who is now in
the hospital here severely burned, assisted
Miss King and Margaret Stokes to escar*.
With the help of Mr. Scott, the first mate
of the Roraima, he constructed a raft
v.ith life preservers. Upon this Miss King
Bttd Margaret were placed.
While this was being done Margaret's
little brother died. Mate Scott brought
the child water at great personal danger,
but it was unavailing. Shortly after the
death of the little boy Mrs. Stokes suc
cumbed. Margaret ajid Miss King even
tually got away on the raft and were
picked up by the steamer Korona. Mate
Scott also escaped. Miss King did not
sustain serious' injury. She covered 1,he
face of Margaret with her dress, but still
the child was probably fatally burned.
The only woman known to have survived
the disaster at St_ Pierre -was a negress
riam^d Flllotte. She was found in a cel
lar Saturday afternoon, where she had
been for three days. She was still alive,
but fearfully burned from head to toes.
She died in the hospital here.
STSAUGE EXPERIENCE
A Â¦woman named Laurent, Â¦who was em
ployed as a servant at St. Pierre In the
household of M. Gabriel, and who was
among those taken to the hospital in this
city, in describing her experiences said
that on the day of the terrible disaster
she heard a loud report and thereupon
fainted. "When she regained her senses
a few hours later she was horribly
burned, and glancing around saw two
members of the Gabriel family still alive,
but they died before assistance could

DESCRIBES HORRORS AT ST, PIERRE
The catastrophe at Martinique and St. Vin
cent is appalling in the extreme. Thousands
of people have met a terrible death and other
thousands are suffering for the want of food.
By request of his Excellency, the President of
the United States. I appeal to you for prompt
alrt to alleviate the sufferings of the unfor
tunate people who have becen made homeless.
Subscriptions will be received at the office
of the Italian- American Bank and promptly
remitted to the Hon. Cornelius Bliss, treasurer
of the New York committee which will act ns
a central distributing point for the country.
Please act promptly.
bÂ±r. Sbarboro at once wired his accept
ance to President Roosevelt and issued
the following, appeal to the people of San
Francisco :
of a committee to receive and distribute funds
for the relief of the 6ufterers from the recent
catastrophe in Martinique and St Vincent.
The -appeal made to the public to-day will
give you information on certain matters of de
tail. Your prompt acceptance will be most
gratifying to the President.
GEORGE D. CORTEL-YOU,
Secretary.
The Pouyer Quertier has distributed to
the sufferers large quantities of bis
cuits, milk, wine and cheese. . ,
The path of the volcano lava . which
swept over St. Pierre is marked out In a
strange manner. The vicinity of the
shore, where vessels anchored, was sv.ept
by a whirlwind of volcanic gas, which
ripped, tore and shattered everything in
its path, but left tew traces of cinders
behind. On the other hand, the fort, the
center and adjoining parts of St. Pierre,
are buried under a thick layer of cin
ders, which consumed everything be
neath it
reach them. Mme. Laurent, although she
lived for some time after being taken to
the hospital and was conscious while un
der the care of the physicians, died with
out being able to impart any additional
information concerning the catastrophe.
The work of succoring the refugees
continues incessantly.
When the- cable- repair ship Pouyer
Quertier, Captain Thirion, started on her
mission of mercy she had to pass through
clouds of burning cinders at the risk of
catching fire in order to reach the ter
ror-stricken people ashore. But, as al
ready announced, she succeeded in bring
ing to this port 456 people, mainly former
residents of the village of Le Precheur.
This was on Saturday last. Since then
the steamer, as the result of other aar
lng trips, has succeeded in bringing
away many other persons to Fort de
France. On Sunday she rescued 923 per
sons and piloted the French cruiser Su
chet and the Danish cruiser Valkyrien,
who took on board 1500 persons.

THE EMPORIUM.
THE EMPOBIXJM."It haÂ«.now been explained by the friends of the
naval officers who got,- into the row at Venice that
the difficulty -was due to the fact that the officers
could not speak Italian, nor could the waiters speak
English, and hence there was no r way of making ex
planations and the f police had to be called in. . The
excuse is good enough, but : it will ! be remembered
that according to the original -story the row -was
something more than a wrestle' with language.
There was alarge part of the proceedings that could
have been understood by a deaf man!
GOOD FRIDAY AND EASTER^-J/ F..
City. Since the year 1801 Good Friday
fell on the 28th of March in 1823. 1834 and
1902. It will fall on that date again in
1986 and 1997. Since 1801, including 1902,
Easter Sunday has fallen in March
twenty-three times, and up to the year
2000 it will occur in that month twenty
one times. Easter Sunday never fell in
the nineteenth century earlier than March
23 but once, and that was in 1818, N ivhen it
fell on the 22d, and will not fall on that
date during the twentieth century.

1801, 1S02, 1815, 183G, 1838, 1852 and 18S2. There
Is, however, no premium on half-dollars
of 1836 bearing the motto "E Pluribus

have not the mint mark O over the date,
and thpse of 1853 that have arrow-heads

Naming of the New States.
Editor The Call: Most people will
agree with the main idea in your "Jef
ferson \ and Montezuma" editorial in to
day's issue, of your valuable journal
viz: When a Territory becomes a State
it should retain the name it had been
known by. An exception to that rule
should be made when its sponsors chris
ten it by simply adding "New" to "any
old thing" and producing such abor
tions as New York, New Jersey and New
Mexico. The term "New,", as part of
name to, a State, is as inappropriate as
"Junior 1 ,' is when following the name of
a man of "three score and. ten." \
New Mexico has associated with it so
many beautiful names of Indian or
Spanish .origin that 'it should be easy to
find one with a pleasant sound which
should be appropriate to this State about
to be born. . I present a few as examples,
viz: Conception; Nacimiento (birth);
Aztec (name of first inhabitants); Cortez
(the discoverer of California, New Mex
ico and contiguous country); Albu
querque; Sequedad r . (dryness);" Aqua
Dulce (sweet water) ; Aqua Fuerte;
Aquardiente (whisky) ; Borracho (drunk) â¢
Carcel (prison)..
The name Oklahoma reminds us of
rough frontier life, with "cowboys, gam
blers, etc. Suppose It was changed to
"Jefferson,"; and immediately the public
would ascribe to its inhabitants all " of
those courtly manners and customs \ of
the good old . "Jeffersonian times." Yours
for euphony, " Â¦; C. G. MINIFIE.

VALUE OF A PATENTâ F. B., Gray
son, Cal. A patent grants to the patentee,
his heirs or assigns for the term of sev
enteen years in the United States the ex
clusive right to make, use and vend the
invention or discovery throughout the
United States and the Territories; conse
quently no one has a right to make a pat
ented article, even_>though for his indi
vidual use, without infringing on the in
ventor's patent and taking chances of in
curring the penalties provided by law.
POPULATIONâ Subscriber, Sebastopol,
Cal. The population of the United States,
Including 91,219 in the military and naval
service, was, according to the census o?
1M0, 76,303,387. According to the same au
thority the population of Stockton was
17,606 and of Santa Rosa 6673.
BASEBALL GROUND â Constant
Reader, City. The California League
baseball grounds are located in Golden
Gate, Alameda County, near Berkeley,
and are reached by the train that leaves
Oakland mole for the place last named.
Games are played there every Wednesday
and Sunday.
It is not necessary to look far away to find a point
where the allied party menaces Republicanism. The
menace . exists in California. The Democratic camp
That the various divisions of the allied party have
no other point of agreement than that of a desire for
the spoils of office does not in any way detract from
the effectiveness of the alliance. In fact, both in war
and in politics many a successful campaign has been
waged by allies of that kind, and it is by no means
improbable that several States now regarded as sure
for the Republicans may be carried on election' day
by the opposition. : / :
At this juncture the Republican party cannot af
ford to commit blunders. The work of reorganizing
the long demoralized ranks of Democracy has been
carried forward with considerable success through
out the Union. Bryan rails at the reorganize^,! but
they pay no attention to him. They are saying noth
ing, but sawing wood most industriously, and their
one appeal to the workers is: "Get together for vic
tory, and we will talk of platforms -and policies
later on."
That statement is as true of the Democracy of
California as of Texas, and the same may be said of
the Democracy of Ncw^ England and of the cotton
States. There is no Democratic platform, no Demo
cratic policy and no Democratic leader.. It would
seem, then, that there is nothing to be feared from
the allied factions that call themselves Democrats,
and some Republicans may be indulging the belief
that their party will have this fall an easy victory in
the Congressional and State elections. Those who
are indulging such a belief had better get rid of it.
There may be no agreement among Democrats on
any issue of statecraft, but there is a firmly based
agreement among them' that they ought to have
the offices of the States and of the nation, and they
are going to make a vigorous fight for them.
THE "allied party" is a title which with as much
accuracy as wit the Galveston News applies to
Democracy. Describing the Democrats of Texas
the News says: "There are among them all-around
expansion Democrats, hemispherical expansion
Democrats, Cuban expansion Democrats and South
American expansion Democrats. There are among
them tariff-for-revenue Democrats, protection Dem
ocrats and Democrats who, while not favoring pro
tection, yet, as long as it is extended to certain in
terests, demand it for those in which they are inter
ested, hence may be called want-a-bite Democrats.
The fact is that the party may be called an allied
party itself."

FOREIGN PATENTSâ E. P.. L., El
Verano, Cal. An article patented in a
foreign country may be patented in the
United States and vice versa.
From this condition of affairs the Russian officials
can learn a valuable lesson if they will. Ignorance
is more revolutionary than intelligence, and a blind,
unreasoning loyalty more dangerous than reason. , If
the Russian Government be wise it will cease to rely
on such things for the stability of the empire. :
That strange document is said to have had more'in
fluence in rousing the peasants than all the harangues
for constitutional government' that the Liberals and
the university students have made since the begin
ning of the agitation. It is effective because it ap
peals directly to the .'peasant and advocates what the
peasant looks upon as simple justice. It is natural
for him to believe that the Czar, whom he has been
taught to regard as a benevolent father, should de
sire to make his people happy and give them their
rights. Consequently the forged ukase finds every
where a ready welcome., The peasants demand, the
land and when the, stewards of the rich lords en
deavor to exact rent they drive them out of the dis
trict.
"My grandfather who is now resting in God, Em
peror Alexander, by abolishing serfdom gave you
peasants liberty and at the same time divided 'the land
among you. The magnates of the land,, however,
were discontented with this and they brought the
land again into their possession and thus robbed you.
The country which for needy wage you cultivate .in
the sweat of your brows' is your own land, and the
corn in the barns of your oppressors is your corn.
I love you and as I desire to be a just Emperor I
allow and command you to demand back your prop
erty and to divide it among yourselves as your legal
possessions. If they refuse to give it to you peace
ably then take it from them by force, together with
the cattle in their stalls and the corn in their barns."
One of these circulars which is reported to , be
pr.nted in the usual form of an imperial ukase says:
SINCE the Russian Government has sought to
hold its people in subjection by keeping them
in ignorance and inculcating among them an
unquestioning obedience to the Czar, the agitators
who are now disturbing the country have sought to
turn the ignorance and the reverence to their ad
vantage. Scattered among the rioting peasants
circulars have been found calling upon them in the
name of the Czar to overthrow the nobles and pil
lage their estates.
In his testimony before the â¢ Senate committee,
General MacArthur gave the Philippines a new title
by calling them a "tuitionary annex." It is now up
to the' lawyers to say whether the constitution can
apply to sifch things.

Of course it will be different with Cuba. We are
not going to be irritated by anything Palma may say
or do. We have expended our treasure' and shed
much American blood to establish the freedom of
Cuba and are desirous that the new government
should be successful in every way. All the same
President Palma should be careful in making his
plea for lower duties. We are not going to surrender
the principle of protection for the sake of making a
Had the representative of any great power made
such a statement there would have been an imme
diate explosion on the part of the American people,
and it would have taken a good deal in the way of
explanation to set things right again. We are not
accustomed to dictation from abroad as to what our
customs duties shall be, and a power that should re
fuse to make any treaty with us until we should have
consented to reduce our duties on its exports would
be promptly told that we are not eager for treaties
of any kind and have no desire to purchase them at
that price. c
A good illustration of his lack of tact in this re
spect is found in that statement made in an interview
at Santa Cruz that "he would recommend that no
treaty be made with the United States until the
amount cf the reduction in American duties on Cu
ban products was known, and that the' reduction
would have to be more than 25 per cent."
So fcr as those statements are concerned there will
be general approval of the President's course. Un
fortunately Palma did not stop there, but proceeded
to talk about the relations of Cuba to the United
States with a degree of frankness which displayed a
good deal more of Cuban patriotism than good sense.
International questions are always delicate, and dip
lomatists rarely discuss them above a whisper. Palma
is not a diplomatist. He has talked openly and loudly
of what he purposes to recommend concerning Cu
ban relations to the United States, and in doing so
has said some very foolish things.
Some of his statements are marked by a com
mendable economy and prudence. He has an
nounced, for example, that he will recommend that
there be no war department nor navy department
in the government, and that the island abstain from
undertaking to support either an army or a navy. He
purposes to give much attention to the development
of a diversified agriculture in place of the well nigh
universal cane-growing, and will continue the sani
tary regulations established by the United States
authorities in the island. In short, he will recom
mend a programme of economy and improvement
and will strive to keep his people contented by help
ing to render them prosperous.
During the tour which he has been making
through the Cuban provinces while waiting for his
inauguration Palma has been quite frank in outlining
the policy he intends to pursue and the recommenda
tions he will make to the Cuban congress in his first
address.
While everything has been done by the authori
ties at Washington tc facilitate the change of ad
ministration and place the new President upon a firm
footing at the start, there will be required of him
nor.e the less a high degree of statesmanship to main
tain his equilibrium and avoid blunders. For that
reason the country will watch the experiment of the
new government with a good deal of interest. It
is not so easy to take a new nation out of the secure
port of a powerful protectorate into the open sea of
independence as it is to take a ship out of a harbor,
End the pilot cannot afford to be overconfident at
any stage of the task.
WITHIN a few days President-elect Palma
will take tha oath of office and enter upon
the task of establishing the government of
Cuba. The ceremony of inauguration is to take place
May 20, and on the evening of that day General
Wood will sail for the United States, leaving the new
government to work out its own salvation.

There is no reason whatever for further delay in
constructing the canal. All the routes have.been'sur
veyed over and over again. The best experts obtain
able have investigated every problem connected with
the enterprise and have made the most accurate es
timates that science can furnish. The arguments of
each route have been submitted and the people have
declared a willingness to bear. the taxation required
to raise the money needed for the construction of the
work. Congress, therefore, can deal with the issue
just as wisely now as it can a year from" now. It
ought either to decide or leave the question to the
President. In fact, the adoption of either bill now
before Congress would be better than the adoption
of none.
Some time ago there was a report that certain
Senators drawn from the membership of v both par
ties had formed a combination to defeat the' Philip
pine bill, -the Cuban reciprocity bill and the isth
mian canal bill. No reliable authority was ever
given for the report, but it* seems to have had some
thing in the way of foundation, for it managed to
persist despite the repeated denials of leading Sena
tors. Probably there was never anything more than
an attempt to form such a combination, but even
that seems to have been abandoned. It would cer-*
tainly have been a gross act of folly for any Repub
lican to have taken part in it, for should Congress
adjourn without doing something toward the attain
ment of the isthmian canal the Republican party
would be held responsible for the delay and the can
didates of the party would have to face a good deal
of popular discontent because of it.
SENATOR HOAR has presented Congress with
a new canal bill, and the fact that he has done
so goes far to confirm the reports that there
is so much opposition to existing bills as to render it
doubtful if either of them can be enacted at this ses
sion. The Senator's bill is simplicity itself. It is a
short document empowering the President to select
a route for an isthmian canal and arrange for the con
struction of the desired waterway, and appropriates
$180,000,000 for the purpose. - : -r~?'~;" â¢ ;.
There can be. no question that ..a. majority -of
the American people would approve the' adoption'- of
the bill, notwithstanding the large v power it confers
upon the President. As a matter of fact the country
has become impatient with the wrangle between the
contending advocates of Nicaragua' and Panama.'
The desire of the people is for a canal at the earliest
possible date, and since it seems unlikely that Con-'
gress will ever agree upon the route, the best thing
to be done is to refer it to the President with power
to act.

Robert Fitzsimmons and .wife occupied
a box in the theater. Fitz seemed greatly
pleased with the performance. He Joined
in the cheering with the rest of tha
crowd.
Last night was Foresters' night at the
Central Theater and the members of the
different courts attended 500 strong.
Special seats were reserved for them,
and the merry throng sent up cheer after
cheer as the different scenes of tha
charming melodrama, "The World,"
were presented. The theater party was
a great success.
Officers for the next term will be chosen
to-morrow and in the evening there will
be a baneuet.
Action will be taken to-day on a propo
sition to make the office of permanent
secretary an elective one.
During .the afternoon an amendment
was carried that lets down the bars as to
one branch of Foresters. In 1887, when a
number of members of the order with
drew on account of the color question,
the High Court passed a law that no'
member of any other order of Forester3
could join the Ancient Order. This , ex
cluded the Independent Order of Forest
ers as well as the American Order, com
posed of seceders. The law passed yes
terday admits all Foresters except thosa
who are members of the American Order.
An amendment proposing to reduce the
initiation fee was introduced.
In conclusion High Chief Ranger Boehm
returns thanks to the permanent secre
tary, John Falconer, and to the deputies
for assistance rendered him during the
past two years. ; '
The best of feeling and completest harmony
has existed during my term of office between
us and that branch of the order known as
the Companions of the Forest, and our thanks
cannot be too warmly expressed for the kindly
and fraternal Interest they have exhibited in
preparing the entertainment and reception ac
corded to the officers and delegates to this
Subsidiary High Court, and as your high chief
ranger I earnestly and heartily recommend that
the members of said branch be admitted to
our endowment fund, as they request by the
resolution adopted at the last meeting of the
Supreme Grand Cir.cle, Companions of the
Forest, now before this, body.
As to the endowment fund, I cannot recom
mend it to our members too strongly. During
the last two years it has not received the sup
port that it merits, and I am satisfied that
this is due to a want of examination on the
part of our brethren. No provident member
of our order who has looked Into this matter
can fail to conclude that it is the best and
cheapest form of Insurance extant.
The number of courts instituted from April
1, 1000, to April 1, 1002. as per quarterly re
port, 44; instituted since April 1. 1002. up to
date, 4; making a total of 48; suspended from
April 1. 1000, to April 1, 1902. 21; net gain In
courts. 27.
I am pleased to inform you that during th*
two years just past the numerical strength of
our order in this Jurisdiction has increased 23
per cent. On March 31, 1000. our member
ship was 7550, and on . March 31. 1902, it
was 9550, a net gain of 2000.
The financial condition of the several courts
in the aggregate show an increase of over It
per cent. On March 31. 1900,, they had $83,
127 74, and on March 31, 1002, their combined
treasuries showed $04,853 45, or a net gain of
$11,725 71.
During- the term last past I have devoted my
entire time to Forestlc work, traveling thou
sands of miles by rail, water and stage, having
visited one hundred and twenty-two courts. I
found. Jt necessary to attend some of them as
many as two, three and four times, thus de
priving- me of the opportunity of going: to a
few others, which fact is a matter of regret
to me, inasmuch as I firmly believe that the
high chief ranger's presence throughout the
Jurisdiction fosters a feeling of harmony and
the organization is cemented together more
strongly.
Â¦ The interior of the Foresters' building
at the corner of O'Farrell and Stockton
streets was gay with decorations of' red,
white, blue and yellow yesterday in hon
or of the tenth session of the Subsidiary
High Court of the Ancient Order of For
esters. High Chief Ranger M. Boehm
opened the session with the usual impres
sive ceremony. After appointing sub
committees and receiving- the report of
the committee on credentials, which
showed that 156 courts of the order were
represented, the reports of the officers
were presented and referred to the com
mittee on distribution. In his annual re
port High Chief Ranger Boehm says:
The. Veterans celebrated the silver anni
versary by a banquet at the California
Hotel last night. After the introduction
of W. T. Galloway the new president,
there were responses to toasts by Dr.

The report of the grand secretary shows
tnat the membership at the close of the
year 1901 was 32,521, an increase of 933
The subordinate lodges during the year

the past year, and Is about $772 68 per
day. There was expended for the home
at Thermalito $22,189.
Grand Master Nicholls further reported
that he paid two visits to the Orphans'
Home at Gilroy, which is under control
of the Rebekahs, and found it in good
condition. He devoted considerable space
to the Odd Fellows' Home at Thermalito
and the purchase of the site on White's
Ranch, near San Jose, on which it Is
proposed to erect a new home. In a
resume the grand master reports that
during the year he officially traveled
15,500 miles by rail, 1000 miles by water
and 840 by team end met 10,435 brothers
at subordinate lodge meetings. He ex
presses himself grateful to the news
papers and makes special mention of The
Call, and returns thanks to Grand Secre
tary Shaw, Assistant Secretary Clifford
and Past Grand Master Watson for as
sistance kindly rendered.
Grand Master William Nicholls Jr., in
his annual report, says that during the
past year one lodge surrendered its char
tei and that six new ones were instituted
at Gazelle, Isleton, Richmond. Dunsmuir,
Los Angeles and Long Beach. Walnut
Grove Lodge consolidated with Nietos
Lodge. Five new h'alls dedicated, to Odd
Fellowship were opened with appropriate
ceremonies. He visited eighty-five lodges
in his district and made eighty-nine visits
outside of the district.
The reports of the grand officers were
read and referred to the committee on dis
tribution, which in turn apportioned them
to special committees for consideration,
except that part of the grand master's
report which deals with the Odd Fellows'
Home. That portion of the report was
referred to the Grand Lodge sitting as a
committee of the whole, and will be made
a special order.' '
The Grand Lodge degree was conferred
in due form on 298 past grands. The dele
gates were each presented with one of
the handsomest badges ever got up for
this body, commemorative of the golden
jubijee session. Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦. .
The Grand Lodge of the Independent
Order of Odd Fellows assembled in fif
tieth annual session yesterday in Odd
Fellows' Hall. More than six hundred
representatives, in addition- to the grand
officers, were present at rollcall.
Of the orphans' home at Gilroy Presi
dent Mrs. Michell says: "During the year
I have had the great pleasure of visiting
the home, and I am really sorry that each
and every Rebekah in this State cannot
avail herself or himself of the same pleas
ure. And here allow me to offer my sin
cere thanks for the very generous re
sponse to circulars issued on behalf of
our 'Orphans' Home donation day/ I
found everything at the home in perfect
order, and a 'home* In every sense of
the wordâ the children all well and happy,
and those who were old enough attending
school regularly."
During the term the president mads
110 official visits.
From the report of the secretary, Mrs.
Mary E. Donoho, it appears that tho
membership is distributed among 231
lodges, and that the net increase of lodges
during the year was 12. The report gives
the following figures showing the growth
of the order since 1S90: In 1S00, 10.404
members; 1891, 11,460; 1892, 12,161; 18D3.
13,083; 1894, 13,817; 1S05. 13,043; 1896, 15,946;
1S97, 16,371; 1838. 16,472; 1899, 17,172; 1900,
18,443; 1901, 19,848.
The increase during the past year Is tho
largest in the history of the order.
During the year the total receipts wera
514,842 and the disbursements $11,098. of
which sum J7169 was for the Orphans'
Home.
The trustees of the home presented a,
detailed report of the working of the in
stitution, in which there are forty-six in
mates. The report will be taken up at the
session to-day. The trustees recommend
ed the establishment of a steam laundry
and a hospital.
Last evening Isabel Lodge of Santa
Cruz, through its team, conferred the de
gree of the order. There was a large at
tendance and the team was highly com
mended for its work.
The Veteran Rebekahs will elect offi
cers to-night and close with a banquet.
New lodges were instituted at North
Ontario, Fullerton, Tgo, Glendale, Wood
bridge, Big Oak Flat. Knob. Newville,
Berkeley, Richmond, Brentwood, Exeter,
Loleta and Los Angeles.
The preliminary ceremonies occupied
the forenoon session. The afternoon was
taken up in the reading of the report of
the president, which is an instructive but
lengthy document. It shows the total
number of members to be 19,843; net gain
for the year, 1405; number of lodges In
stituted, 14; number of lodges May 10,
1902, 251.
The twelfth annual session of the Re
bekah Assembly of tne Independent Order
of Odd Fellovrs cf California opened yes
terday morning in Memorial Hall of tt\e
Odd Fellows' building, with President
Mrs. Nellie Michell' and all the grand
officers in attendance. Three hundred
delegates, two hundred cf whom had
never before attended a session of the
assembly, were present. These, with
nearly two hundred past noble grands, re
ceived the assembly degree, the largest
number upon which the degree has been
conferred at any one time.
It is barely possible that the warnings of science
might keep people away from danger in the volcano
lands, and this awful tragedy may help toward that
end, but the fact remains that up to this time no
warning and no experience have kept men from pass
ing the danger line.
The destruction of St. Pierre on Martinique, and
of other" towns by the volcanoes of the lesstr An
tilles, is a recent and awful warning to stay on the
right side of nature's danger line. This generation
will heed it. St. Pierre will not rise from its ashes
now. But by and by men will forget. The sides of
Pelee will again bear forests and birds will sing
there and tinkling water will trickle down the path
that was trodden by fire, and when a large population
has grown at the base of the mountain, some day
when all are busy with work and affairs, or some
night when all are at pleasure, Pelee's fiery banner
will shoot skyward and, falling, enfold all life and
recreate the desolation in which it made the island
originally and in which for ages it has built on and
added to the original plan.
It is so with the dwellers in volcano lands. Ve
suvius had belched lava long before the time of
Romulus and Remus. The volcano had probably
been an island originally, but emitted the material
that built it on to the mainland, lengthening the
peninsula. Eighteen hundred years ago men had for
gotten that the fiery mountain was destructive and
they had built Herculaneum and Pompeii at its base.
In one night they were buried so completely that
their graves were forgotten. The volcano spread over
them fifty feet of hct ashes, and their homes and
temples, theaters, baths and galleries were smitten
from the sight of men, to make no sign for. nearly
twenty centuries. Now homes are built up the
slopes of Vesuvius and cities spring at its base. But
some time they will surely join Herculaneum and
Pompeii.
Nature is persevering and persistent. Where she
has once set her danger signal it is Well for man to
be careful. In the valley of. the Rhone were vast an
cient floods, but these had so long ceased that cities
were built down to the water's edge and hundreds
of thousands of people planted and dwelt where, once
the water had rolled in a destructive flood. Sud
denly the flood, absent more than a century, came
again, and cities were washed away, hundreds were
drowned and thousands made homeless. The water
shed of the Rhone had not changed. When there
fell upon it the same amount of rain that fell to make
the ancient floods they were sure to come again, and
it fell and they came: Another century or two may
pass before another Rhone flood, but it will come,
and if people meantime forget and go carelessly over
nature's danger line they will suffer.
The islands have always strongly appealed to the
imagination of man, and the high cones of the vol
canoes that built them are among their attractions.
The forests climb far up these slopes and farms and
gardens hang upon their acclivities, all presenting^
picture of peace and happiness. But there is no
guarantee that the force that made the foundation for
it all was spent in its creation. The most persistent
volcanoes in the world are either insular or penin
sular. The craters on island groups are the aptest
to erupt. â¢
*T-iHERE is really no guarantee against the per-
I sistence of nature. A majority of the islands
â¢*â¢ of the sea are of volcanic origin. The internal
forces of the earth expel and throw out material un
til the mass rises above the water and the great
chimney continues supplying matter until its over
flow makes a roomy island. The eruption ceases.
The mass cools, the lava cracks and breaks, the sun
and rain join in reducing it until the soil appears
of supporting vegetable life, and finally the
vast tumuli formed by volcanic action become beau
tiful spots, fertile and verdant. They attract man,
and he lives upon land that was once fire, and where
molten hell dashed waves of flame as high as the
swells of the ocean a paradise is in bloom and homes
are built and children play in the perfumed air.

in this State is just as divided as that of Texasion all
questions of the time, but it is also just as hungry
for the spoils of victory. .If! the. Republicans should
make a blunder that wo'tjid alienate the independent
vote, or cause any. considerable discontent among
the rank, and file, Democracy would be prompt to
profit by it. Such a political folly' as the renomina-
tion of Gage, for example, would render the defeat
of the party almost a certainty. It is that fact which
makes the action of the Herrin bosses so portentous
at this time. If they and their henchmen should suc
ceed in dominating, the Republican State Convention
the camp of the allied party would be reinforced by

Petroleum in the Custom-House.
A telegTam of inquiry was received
from Washington, yesterday by Customs
Collector Stratton asking his opinion as
to the substitution of petroleum for coal
for heating and power in the Appraisers'
Building. The Collector replied that' he
heartily approved of the suggested
change.
Godchaux- further calls atttention to the
fact tha.t the business of his office has
grown enormously during his incumbency,
yet the appropriation has remained the
same. Only $1900 monthly is allowed for
copyists' salaries, yet the receipts of the
office average more than $3000 monthly,
says Godchaux.
"My office is more than self-sustaining,
yet the Board of Supervisors grudges us
a sufficient appropriation to pay copyists
a fair salary. I have been obliged to em
ploy twenty-six copyists to do the work
which is daily increasing. Under the
charter they are allowed 8 cents a folio
and each of them copies 1200 or 1500 folios
monthly, for which they receive but $72,
which reduces their compensation to 5 or
6 cents a folio. I do not think this is just
and my copyists are seeking work else
where because of the insufficient pay.
Theirs is really skilled labor because it
consists of using the book type-writing
machines, and I am afraid that I cannot
get competent men to replace them."
Recorder Edmond Godchaux fears that
the copyists intend to go on a strike be
cause the limited appropriation in this
year's budget has caused their salaries to
drop from $100 to $72 a month. Two copy
iVts have already sent in their resigna
tionsâPaul Vlauntin and' Edward Healy.
Godchaux says that others will follow
their example unless the Board of Super
visors provides an increased fund so that
their salaries will reach the limit of $100
allowed by the charter. ,

tion for Salaries the

The planting of trees in cities and
towns, the cleaning of streets and endeav
ors to secure statues and fountains to
ornament public places were some of the
objects which he pointed out as being
well within the province of women's work.
Loyalty to the interests of the State in

The Supervisors' Finance Committee
recommended last night that provision
be made to prevent further deficits in the
police pension fund by contributing threto
50 per cent of all pawnbrokers' licenses
collected instead. of 25 per cent, as h/ere
tcfore, and 10 per cent of all liquor li
censes instead of 7% per cent, Ex-Ser
geant W. D. Hensley and ex-Captain
Stone explained that the estimated deficit
for this year amounted to from $10,000 to
$15,000. It is believed that the increased
allowance will net the amount required.
Park Commissioner R. H. Lloyd ad
dressed the committee on behalf of the
request that the limit of 7 cents in taxa
tion allowed by the charter be recom
mended as the appropriation for park
purposes. Mr. Lloyd and Superintendent
McLaren explained that even then the
amount would be inadequate to carry
out certain planned improvements. The
utmost care would be taken to make a,
judicious use of the appropriation, which
is absolutely required on account of the
increased wages paid to laborers and the
fact that the water used in . the parka
was paid out of the fund, Mr. Lloyd
said. It was intended to erect a wind
mill near the life-saving station j which
will furnish the . water necessary for
Golden Gate Park, but the fourteen other
parks had to be provided for, he stated.
The request was taken under advise
ment.
Mr. Lloyd also stated that the United
Railroads had agreed to contribute $150
for each Sunday concert, so this amuse
ment will be continued.
The food, dairy and market inspectors
employed in the Health Department
pleaded for an increase in salary from
3>75 to $100 per month. The janitors peti
tioned that their wages be raised from
$2 50 per day to $75 per month; the guards
in County Jail No. 2 asked that their
salaries be fixed at $75 per month instead
of $50, and the ambulance drivers asked
to be raised from $65 to $75 per month.
The plumbing inspectors requested that
their salaries be raised from $100 to $125
per month. All the petitions were taken
under advisement, with the exception of
that of the ambulance drivers. It de
veloped that, though the last budget pro
vided for the payment of $75 monthly to
these drivers, the Health Board had, on
it3 account, paid them only $65. The
I committee recommended a resolution di
recting the Health Board to -pay to the
men the difference, which it holds they
have been unjustly deprived of
Edgar Painter, secretary of the North
Central Club, urged an appropriation of
$100,000 to repave accepted streets in the
business district. The committee ex
pressed itself in favor of the improve
ment, but postponed action thereon.
AXL-2TIGHT CAR SERVICE

United Railroad Directors Have Not
Yet Taken Action in Appoint

It !s expected that Inside of the next
"few weeks the United Railroads of San
Francisco will institute an all-night car
service. The directors of- the road are
now considering the matter.
"There is nothing new about the pro
posed owl service," said President Hol
land yesterday. "The directors will come
10 a decision, however, within a few
days."

that the directors of the United Railroads
had as yet taken no action in appoint
ing Manager Vining's successor.
Blanchard Recital.
Mrs. M. E. Blanchard, the clever con
tralto, gave the first of two song recitals
last night at the First Unitarian Church,
under the auspices of the Channing Aux
iliary. A small but very enthusiastic au
dience greeted the charming singer in one
of the most attractive programmes of the
season. Perhaps Mrs. Blanchard was at
her best in the Brahms songs, the "Ruhe
Sussliebchen" being given with exquisite
intention and execution. Two Pergolesi
songs, "Ogni Pena Piu Spiettata" and
"Stizzoso, mio Stizzoso," were most pleas
ingly rendered, and the old English bal
lad, "The Three Ravens," was another
number that suited admirably both the
voice and sympathies of the singer. God
ard's "Reveillez-vous" elicited a hearty
encore and was graciously repeated. The
others of the group of French songs, two
of Delibes', were not quite so successful
Mrs. Blanchard closed , her programme
with a group of characteristic American
compositions, Including songs by Foote
Chadwick and Johns. The student of sing
ing andÂ«lover of good songs cannot do
better than hear Mrs. Blanchard, who is
in the front rank of local vocalists. She
gives another excellent programme at the
same place on Saturday afternoon next
that will include Strauss, Franz, Brahms
Schubert and McDowell among its contri
butions. '

DR. PARDEE'S RECRUIT.
President E. H. Harriman ia recognized
throughout the country as a business man
who possesses remarkable powers of pen
etration. It would be interesting to know
if he has discerned during his sojourn in
California any reason why 'the railroad
which he directs should have a favored
candidate for Governor of the State. Un
questionably Mr. Harriman has the right
as a free and intelligent American citi
zen to size up all our candidates â to judge
of their moral worth and physical attri
butes â but his individual preference
should not constitute corporative indorse
ment. The State has a large quota of
shrewd lawyers and political rounders
who have derived much sustenance from
the Southern Pacific payroll. They con
vinced some of President Harrlman's pre
decessors that the public was hostile* to
the Southern Pacific, and that their serv
ices were needed at the Legislature and
State conventions, and in politics gener
ally, to protect the property of the com
pany.. To create a demand for their serv
ices they have had "cinch" bills intro
duced in the Legislature and have suc
ceded in getting money from the com
pany's treasury to defeat such bills. At
tempts may be made to play the old
game on President Harriman. If the
president will study the situation care
fully he will ascertain that the people are
not opposed to his company. Neither po
litical party is threatening to tear up his
rails. The chief danger that now confronts
the Southern Pacific is that W. F. Herrin
of the law department will use the com
pany's money and prestige to control
State nominating conventions. As Herrin
is so fond of politics, why should it not
be suggested that he resign his position
as political manager- of the company and
enter the field in person as a candidate
for Governor? The Democrats who are
looking around for a suitable candidate
might be willing to accept him as their
standard-bearer.
HARRIMAN'S OPPORTUNITY.
The sub-committee having the work of
apportionment in hand is composed of
George Stone, W. M. Cutter, W. S. Wood,
A. â¢ B; Lemmon, E.' C. Hart and Jacob
Steppacher. Careful calculation has been
found necessary, especially in Assembly
districts where certain precincts are
within the limits of a city to which the
primary election law directly applies and
other precincts beyond such limits. In
these cases the principle of precinct regiSr
tration is recognized. Leading members
of the State Central Committee are op
posed to the machine system of appoint
ing delegates, and it is believed that the
recommendation for primaries will be
adopted. County conventions composed of
delegates chosen at primary election may
be empowered to elect delegates, but the
right "of Count y Committees to appoint
will doubtless be challenged. County con
ventions springing directly from the peo
ple through the agency of the primary
may meet shortly after August 12, elect
delegates to the State convention and
then adjourn to meet in September for
the purpose of nominating county offi
cers. In most of the counties, however,
the practice of electing delegates to the
county convention at the same time State
delegates are elected will be followed. A
large convention, coming directly from
the people, seems to be the demand of
thu Republican party. The bosses have
apparently abandoned the programme of
packing the State convention with dele
gates appointed by push County Com
mittees.
WORK OF APPORTIONMENT.
The Republican State Central Committee
will meet in this city Saturday, â¢ May 24,
to fix the time and place for holding the
State Convention. Sacramento will doubt
less be chosen as the place, because the
capital city possesses so many facilities
for a large convention. The State Fair
will not open until September 9, hence the
Agricultural Pavilion can be used prior to
September 5. Members of the sub-com
mittee, who were appointed to propose a
call tor the convention, will report to the
executive body Friday, May 23, but it Is
understood that the date of holding the
convention will be left blank. The point
at jssue is whether the delegates should
be called to assemble on August 25 or Sep
tember 1. This question will be settled
by the general committee on May 24.
Two plans on apportionment will also be
submitted to the State Committee. One
allows a delegate for every . 250 Republi
can votes cast at the general election in
1800. The other permits a delegate, for ev
ery 200 Republican votes cast at the same
election. Should the first be adopted 33
the basis of representation, the conven

The dead man was a brother of W. J.
Brady, proprietor of the Eureka Boiler
Works. 113-115 Mission street, and lived
at Harriet and Bryant streets. He had
been a boilermaker but retired some years
ago and was living on the money he had
saved. He was 75 years of age.
John Brady, the old man who was
brutally . kicked on the head by Arthur
Terry in -a cell at the City. Hall Branch
Prison on Monday afternoon, died at
the Emergency Hospital about 7
o'clock yesterday morning, and the
body . was removed â¢ to the Morgue.
The autopsy showed that there were
thirteen gashes in the old man's scalp,
varying from a auarter of an inch to
five inches in length, and that death
was caused by concussion of the brain.
Terry .was booked on a charge of murder
and was instructed and arraigned before
Judge Cabanisa and the case continued
till to-morrow.
Brady was arrested on Fourth street by
Policeman J. A. Ryan for being drunk
about 2 o'clock Monday afternoon. Terry
was arrested on Market street by Police
man P. J. Mitchell for disturbing the
peace about an hour later. He was vio
lent when taken to prison and fought
with the officer while being searched.
Booking Officer H. G. White succeeded in
pacifying him and he walked willingly to
the cell, where the old man had been pre
viously placed. He stretched himself on
the wooden bench in the cell and Police
man J. Phelan, who was on duty at the
prison, thought he was going to sleep.
About ten minutes later Phelan remark
ed to White that he thought he heard a
noise as if some one had fallen in the cell.
Phelan walked to the cell and saw Brady
lying on the floor with his head covered
with blood. Phelan called to White and
White sent Brady to the Emergency Hos
pital in the patrol wagon.
All that Terry would say was that
Brady had attacked him and he had to
defend himself. He is a cabinetmaker, 25
years of age, and powerfully built. It Is
supposed that in his. ugly temper he
pleked a quarrel with the inoffensive old
man, knocked him down and kicked him
into unconsciousness.
A bold and unscrupulous trick of Letson
Eaiiitt, whose "bubble" mining schemes
have enriched him at the expense of gulli
ble peopie.was exposed in Judge Cabaniss'
court yesierday afternoon.
On May 1 Balliet swore to a complaint
before Judge Cabaniss accusing his for
mer bookkeeper ana stenographer, Mrs.
Alice D. Young, with felony embezzle
ment, fche left nis employment in Decem
ber and he said that upon examining the
books of the White Swan Mines Company
be had discovered a shortage of $365.
Mrs. Young is a material witness
r.galnst Balliet in a case to be heard
against him on May IS in the Federal
court nt Des Moines. Iowa, for using the
mails for fraudulent purposes, and it was
surmised then that his object in swear
ing against Mrs. Young was to discredit
lier as a witness against him. It has now
Ueveloped that his object was even worse
than simply discrediting her.
At the time the warrant was issiied
Mrs. Young was living in Los Angeles
and when she learned of the charge made
against her she became hysterical and it
eo preyed upon her mind that she became
ill and was confined to bed. She con
sulted Attorney Rogers of that city and
as the time was approaching for her to
leave for Des Moines, Rogers advised her
to come to this city and face the charge
against her. She was still suffering, but
bravely decided to go through the ordeal.
Accompanied by Attorney Rogers Mrs.
Young reached this city yesterday morn
ing and called at the United States Dis
trict Attorney's office. Assistant United
States District Attorney McKinley went
with her to District Attorney Byington's
office and explained that Balliet had
eworn out the warrant for Mrs. Young's
arrest, so that when she left the State
lor Des Moines he would have her ar
rested and extradited, thereby preventing
her from giving her testimony against
him. Balliet left this city last Wednes
day for Des Moines, taking with him all
his books and papers.
These facts were explained by Assistant
District Attorney Hanley to Judge Caba-
Tiiss and after Mrs. Young had been for
mally booked at the City Prison, she was
taken before the Judge, instructed and
arraigned and the case dismissed on mo
tion of the District Attorney. Mrs. Young
left for Des Moines on yesterday after
noon's train.

The Germ That Causes- It Has to Be
Destroyed to Cure Dandruff.
Many a woman spends an hour twice a
week scouring her scalp, thinking scrub-
bing off the scurf will cure 'the dandruff.
Two hours a week, at the age of 40 years,
she has spent 2G0 days of 12 hours each,
or two-thirds of a year of her life in that
vain hope; vain because you can't cure
dandruff without killing the dandruff
germ, and the only hair preparation .on
earth that will do that is Newbro's
"Herpicide" â also a delightful hair dress-

contagion from use of other's hair

Denies the Story.
I immediately visited the Hall of Justice
and briefly Informed you of the facts as above
related and was Instructed by you to proceed
with the prosecution of the case regardless of
any threatsr
The first calling of the cass was on Wednes
day, Mav 1. in Department 1 of the Police
Court, Judge E. P. Mogan. At the request of
Crothers' attorney, Judge Salomon, the hear
ing was continued until to-day. At the calling
of tbe case to-day Charles A. Low appeared
for the defendant. I produced all of the wit
nesses for the prosecution and made out a per
fect case against the defendant. n
The defense produced one witness, J. M.
Clemens, one of the two men who entered the
room in Mis. Darling's house, as before re
lated, and he" testified that I had offered to
"equare" the case for $150, 'of which amount
$50 was to go to the Judge. He asserted that
he had heard this offer made by me to Mrs.
Darling while listening behind a door in an
adjolninc room.
At the "time Clemens alleges that I made this
offer Crothers' case had not been assigned to
any court, and it waa not in my power to have
it assicned to any particular one of the four
police courts.
Also Crothers in the City Prison and in my
presence made a proposition or rather a sug
gestion to M. A. Gunst to have the charse
against him reduced from a felony . to a mis
demeanor for a money consideration. Also Mrs.
Da-rlinc went to Mr. Gunst at . his office, 23
Kearny street, and there made a similar prop
osition to him. - - -.
This and . other corroborative evidence of a
similar nature I will produce at your pleasure.
The charge against Crothers is Bet for fur
ther hearing at 12 o'clock to-morrow. Re
spectfully, L. L. LEVINGS, Police Officer.
When seen later Levings said;
LEVINGS EXPLAINS.
This la a plain, ordinary attempt oa tha
Mr*. Darling, requesting me to call at her
house that evening on a matter of Importance. '
I called at her house at about 9 o'clock that
evening and was told by Mrs. Darling that
she was very much attached to Crothers, and
that she was desirous of saving him from go

the defense of Crothers, the amount mentioned
to be repaid by Mrs. Crothers at her . con

This amount, Mrs. Darling told roe, was at
my disposal if " I Â¦ would consent to have the
felony charge reduced to a misdemeanor, to
which latter charge Crothers - wuold plead
gutltv and consent to take, a sentence of six
months in the County Jail. I told her that I
could have nothing to do' with such a proposi

the crime of grand larceny, and that I had no
other connection with the case than that of an
arresting officer. She continued to plead that

willing to "square" the case fof*$150 and that
they guessed I would now be good/*
They said they were friends of Crothers and
that they were reluctant to make trouble for
me, but that unless I "let up" in my prose

Board of Police Commissioners on a charge of
attempted extortion. They said they were
three to one. and that I would have no chance
to clear myself of the charge. Also that they

I knew nothing about this case until Levings
came- to me several nights aero and told me
that he was being Jobbed by designing peopl"
who sought to free a criminal whom he had
arrested. I listened to his story of what oc
curred ' and censured him for going near Mrs
Darling. Levings explained first his visit to
Mrs. Darling's house by saying that Crothers
or McWilliams, as he is better known, lived
with Mrs. Darling and that he wanted to
search his room for more stolen property.
After making one visit to the' house Levings
told me .that he went again, and I told him
that I. would insist on his prosecuting the
case, and that if there was any attempt to job
him -it would come out in the course of the
trial. . The Police Commission was In session
at the time and I was rather put out about
being disturbed. The matter slipped my mind
entirely until this morning, when the case
came up In court. I Intend to probe this mat
ter to the bottoms If Levlngs Is the victim of
a clique of designing people who are trying to
free a'crlminal I Intend to see that Justice Is
done him. â¢ If I find that he Is. guilty of the
crime charged against him I will see that he
suffers for his offense. â¢ The whole question as
It is presented in court Is whether or not Police

Chief Wittman when seen. to-night said:
I came back immediately to the Hall of Jus

visited Mrs. Darling's house at her request and
that Mrs. Darling and her friends tried to job
me. Chief Wittman told me to press the case
to the end and if there was a Job In It any

that he might just as well stop talking. He
s&id: "If you don't drop the prosecution of

Mrs. Darling's Offer.
Two days later. 1. e.. May 6. I received a
telephone message at the Hall of Justice from
Under instructions from you Crothers was
locked up and his name placed on the detinue
book, pending further investigation. This in-
VteEtlffation was conducted by myself, and re-
Fulted in finding that Crothers had recently
been released from the County Jail, where he
had served a sentence of three months on a
plea of guilty to one of fifteen charges of petty
theft. Aleo I located his room at 913 Eddy
street, a house kept by a Mrs. Darling, with
v.-hem. according to the prisoner's statement to
me. he was friendly. I also visited the house,
se&rched the room, but found nothing incrim
inating;
Crothers was arrested by me May 2, 1902,
in the afternoon, on Larkin street, between
Kills and Eddy. He had in his possession a
ca?e containing: 1000 cigars of the value of
J8T 00, the property of M. A. Gunst & Co.,
of 23 Kearny Frect. These cigrars had been ob
tained by Crothers on a bogus telephone order
purporting to, be from Redington & Co., whole-
Bale druggists.
LEVINGS' BEPOET TO CHIEF.
SAX FEAXCISCO. Cal., May 13. 1902.
George W. Wittman Esq., Chief of Police-^
Sir: Complying- with your instructions I sub
mit herewith a brief summary of th& facts
and incidents connectfd with the arrest and
partial hearing of J. C. Crothers, alias F. AV.
McWillisms.
The further hearing of the case was
postponed by Judge Mogan until to-day at
jioon, when Mrs. Darling, Douglass and
M. A. Gunst will be called upon to testify.
Levir.gs was suspended yesterday after
noon by Chief Wittman. pending a fur
ther investigation of the scandal. Lev
ings has made the following report of the
case to Chief Wittman:
When Levings left the witness stand
Grover Clemmer was called, and he testi
fied that he heard Levings make a delib
erate offer to drop the prosecution for the
sum of $150. Clemmer further testified
that he was in an adjoining room with
Douglass and that he heard him refuse
an ouer of $100 for the alleged reason that
he had to give $50 to the Judge. Before
Mrs. Darling succeeded in getting Lev
ings to agree to drop the case, according
to the testimony of Clemmer,- Levings
saw the shadow of Douglass through the
Class door and he immediately became
suspicious and said: "What are you try
ing to do? Are you trying to job me?"
Prosecuting Attorney John J. Greeley
questioned Levings and brought out the
fact that while Levings was visiting Mrs.
Darling and while she was making her of
fer of $150 two men stepped out of an ad
joining room and said: "Now I guess you
will be good. We are three against one,
and you had better drop this case."
CLEMMEE'S EVIDENCE.
Policeman Levings was detailed on the
case and he arrested Crothers on Larkin
street a short time afterward. -Crothers
had the cigars in his possession and Lev-
Ings took him to the Hall of Justice and
placed him in the "tanks" pending a fur
ther investigation of the case.
A few days later, according to the story
/told by Levings on the witness stand yes
terday, Crothers informed him that he
had been in serious trouble before and he
Â¦wanted to know if money could square
the case. According to the further testi
nioiiv elicited from Levings by ex-Judge
Lowl counsel for the defendant, Crothers
told him that he was living with Mrs. C.
E. Darling at S13 Eddy street and that if
anything could be done to have the charge
reduced to petty larceny she would pay
him the sum of $150.
Leving-s admitted on the stand that he
called at the residence of Mrs. Darling
May 6 in response to a telephone message
from her. While there, according to Lev
ings' story, the woman made an offer of
$150 which was to be paid to him if he
â¢would "square" the case and drop the
prosecution. In response to questions put
by counsel for the defendant Levings
stated that he indignantly refused the of
fer and explained that it was beyond his
power to fix the case, as M. A. Gunst
intended to prosecute it vigorously.
OFFERED TO SQUABE CASE.
Grover Clemmer, a witness for the de
fense, testllied that Patrolman Levings
called at the residence of Mrs. C. E. Dar
ling, a friend of the accused, and offered
to "square" the case for the sum of $150,
a portion of which amount he claimed,
it is alleged, was to be paid to the Judge.
Levings indignantly denied that ne
maae any sucn offer and in his own de
fense made a counter-charge to the effect
mat Airs. Oariing. Clemmer and Joftn
JDouglass, a clerk in Attorney Solomon's
office, tried to "job" him, as lie expressed
it, so he would desist in the prosecution
of Crothers.
Crothers was arrested May 2 on a charge
of having stolen a case of cigars from M.
A. Gunst. The defendant and an accom
plice, it is alleged, telephoned to Gunst's
place of business and ordered the cigars
in the name of Redington & Co. Suspect
ing after the goods were delivered to a
young man who called for them that all
was not right Gunst telephoned to Lieu
tenant Birdsall at the City Hall station,
asking him to intercept the messenger
â¢who had received the cigars.
The preliminary examination of J. C.
Crothers, alias F. W. Me Williams, on a
charge of grand larceny was commenced
yesterday before Police Judge Mogan and
involved Policeman L. L. Livings, who
made the arrest, in a serious' scandal.

Patrolman Offered to "Square"

ATLANTIC CITT, May 13."â Archie Mc-
Eachern, the well-known champion bicy
cle rider of Toronto, Canada, while being
paced by a motor tandem this â¢ afternoon
at the Coliseum track met with an acci
dent which resulted in his death twenty
minutes later. The accident was the re
sult of the breaking of the chain on the
motor cycle. Riding the tandem were Alt
Boake and Robert. B: Thompson, who
have raced with McEachern for ten years
past. . "Â¦ â¢
The effort this afternoon was to estab
lish a new mile record. Several miles had
been covered when the chain broke. * In
the sudden slowing up of the damaged
tandem McEachern collided with it and
shot in the -air. like a rocket. His head
struck against a projecting board, which
cut a gash In his neck, from which blood
spurted in streams. The jugular vein had
been torn open. He expired shortly after
his removal to a hospital. Boake and
Thompson were uninjured. " :

TJKIAH, May 13.â "While riding on a flat
car laden with heavy timbers Thomas
Megaw sustained injuries yesterday which
probably will cost him his life. Megaw
was engaged with Frank Dutro and others
in removing some landings in a gulch,
and after tearing the landings to pieces
had placed the timbers on a flatcar. Tha
grade in the gulch is quite steep, and it
was only necessary to loosen the brake
on the car and allow it to move. Thus
the timbers were being conveyed down*
the track to the river aHd on to a switch
convenient to an adjoining gulch in which
they were to be again erected.
Megaw and Dutro were In charge ofthe
car and had loosened the brake. They
were controlling the speed of the car witn
the brake, but when a short distance had
been traversed the brake chain broke.
Instantly the car gained frightful mo
mentum. Dutro leaped and escaped un
hurt. Megaw started to follow the ex
ample of his companion, but before he
succeeded the car left the rails and struck
in the soft earth with a thud. Megaw
was pitched headlong into the air, and a
number of the heavy timbers fell upon
him. Dutro was unable to move them,
and Megaw had to sustain the entire
weight until Dutro ran some distance for
assistance. V
That Megaw Was not killed outright Is
remarkable, as the heavy timbers struck
him as they fell. He lay pinioned under
them for upward of fifteen minutes. It !s
not believed that he will survive his in
juries. ,

ifornia Leads to This
r'-vA Result. - v uC-~
Increased Use of Oil as Fuel in Cal-
TACOMA, May 13.â The Carbon Hill
coal mines at Carbonado, owned by the
Southern Pacific Company, have Â¦ been
closed because the increased use of oil
in California renders their . output no
longer necessary for use as fuel on South
ern Pacific trains and the San Francisco
and Oakland ferry-boats.
The Carbonado mines employed nearly.
500 men,' many of whom are thrown out
of employment. '.
There Is a silver lining tp the cloud at
Carbonado, however, because seventy
five coke ovens are being built," and these
will convert the coal heretofore shipped
to San Francisco into coke, for - which
there is a rapidly increasing demand from
Northwestern smelters. The operation of
the coke ovens will bring employment to
about as many miners as previously. I*
the venture proves successful 200 more
ovens will be built.

POLICE BELIEVE
WARD IS BAD
Record of Man Who Cut
Wide Swath in Oak
land Uncovered.
Though He Claims to Have
Coin in Bank Ho Has
No Attorney.
Oakland Office San Francisco CalL
1118 Broadway. May 13.
A week's work by the police has uncov
ered enough of the past of Michael T.
Ward, who played the part of an heir to
$600,000 and is in jail for the alleged theft
of a diamond ring, to satisfy them that
their prisoner is thoroughly bad.
Ward has a record in San Francisco aa
a swindler of women, ifis name appears
on the police books across the bay as a
rogues' gallery subject. The record reads:
"Michael T. Ward, convicted W a charge
of obtaining money from a woman by
trick and device on August 28, 1896, and
sentenced to serve six months in tha
County Jail."
Furthermore Detective Denny D. Hol
land has been making additional inquiries
amongr the police in San Francisco, and
he declares that the woman in this case
was only one among Ward's victims. Hoi
land said: Â°
"The woman who was â¢ swindled and
prosecuted Ward, lost only a small
amount, but Detective Anthony informed
me thai Ward got. $2000 from-^a French
woman in San Francisco several year*
ago, and that she refused to prosecuta
him." ...
According to the police, Ward has a
family in Tacoma, but was divorced there
before he met his present wife, from
whom she has complained he has secured
$2500, her gold watch and chain and a
diamond pin since their marriage a few
months ago.
The whereabouts of this jewelry and of
the diamond pin Ward got from Jeweler
S. Lathrop, has not been discovered. Tho
detectives say that Ward pawned them.
As an heir to a fortune, as a successful
railroad contractor and man about town,
Ward has made many acquaintances in
Oakland. The police are now looking
about for further light. Around headquar
ters it is rumored that Ward is not un
known in San Jose, Los Angeles, Tacoma,
Seattle, Ogden and other cities on the
coast and In nearby States.
A man who answers Ward's description
dropped into San Leanclro several years
ago And interested a number of the local
capitalists in a proposition to build an
electric railroad from that town to San
Jose. The promoter claimed to have ex
cessive railroad experience as a builder.
He lived as became a successful operat
or, and, it is said, managed to make such
an Impression that several fat loans were
made to him, before he dropped out of
sight. -
Investigation Is being made to discover
whether the prisoner and the promoter
are one and the same person. The police
strongly suspect they are identical.
Ward's examination on the charge of
grand larceny has been twice continued,
at his request, and Is now set for to-mor
row morning in the police court. Al
though he claims to have $600,000 in sight
awaiting his call on a British bank, an
attorney has not been employed in Ward'3
behalf.

MATT RYAN BROWNED
OFF THE LEELANAW
Brown, who acted as spokesman for the
committee, stated that as San Francisco
Is the natural trading center for the val
ley he thinks that the city should assist
In setting up the valley exhibit. .
The committee consists of Colvin B.
Brown of Stockton, L. N. Nares of Fresno
and Ben"M. Maddox of Tulare County.
The funds up to the present time for the
work have been raised through the San
Francisco banks. At a meeting at Porter
vllle on Saturday last it was stated that
if the .work at Los Angeles were to be
continued more funds must be raised, and
the Promotion Committee has' undertaken
the task.
The California Promotion Committee at
its session yesterday appropriated $250
per month for the period of one year to
enable the San Joaquin Valley Commer
cial Association to maintain a free exhibit
in Los Angeles. â¢
A grand excursion has been planned un
der theauspices of the committee to the
Sacramento Valley from June 6 to 8. A
special train will leave San Francisco
June 6 at 12:30 p. m. and will proceed to
Stockton. Stops will be made at Stockton,
Sacramento, Marysvilie, Oroville, Chico,
Vina, Red Bluff, Redding, Corning, Wil
lows, Colusa and Woodland. The return
trip will be made from Woodland.
There will also be an excursion by the
committee to Tulare County. The party
will leave here June 23. ' Extensive prep
arations have been made for the trip and
the excursionists will be lavishly enter
tained along the route. The different can
yons for wnlch Tulare is famous will be
thoroughly explored, with a view of
bringing tourists there instead of to the
Yosemite. Tulare is said to rival the fa
mous valley in many respects. ,
Special stages and teams have been
chartered in order that the visitors may
have a better chance of visiting the won
derful orchards, vineyards and grain fields
of fertile Tulare. The country surround
ing Tulare will be visited and the com
mittee believes that the trip will work a
wonderful boom in the southern counties.
Professor J. A. Barr of Stockton .was
appointed to represent the committee at
the meeting of the San Joaquin Commer
cial Association, now being held at Por
terville.. A resolution was adopted in fa
vor of extensive advertising of California

took a drop. Rhubarb was dull and stocks were

NEW YORK, May 13.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's financial cablegram from London
says: The Stock Exchange business to-day
was merely nominal, but the tone was cheer
ful on General Kitchener's capture of Boers?.
Americans continue stoutly to resist the in
fluence of New York's high money rates, bad
crop reports and the coal strike. To the mar
kets this is a surprise, but the buying is not
local, it is simply a continuance of New York's
rx>licy of transferring speculative commitments
here because of the cheapness in carrying
stocks. The rest was a repetition of yesterday.
It opened hard and then improved. New York
sold at first and then turned buyer, with the re
sult that prices closed at the top. The three
features were Atchison, Union Pacific and Ca
nadian Pacific. Copper sold at Â£54 5s the ton
and Rio Tintos were steady. .

NEW YORK, May 13.â To-day's stock mar
ket was a dull and narrow affair between
professional traders, for the most Dart, but
a stronger tone was unmistakable. There was
a natural recovery from yesterday's weakness.
The influences which weakened the markets
then were removed to-day and there wa s a
considerable; demand from, the professional
short interest which sold stocks yesterday on
the unfavorable developments. The publica
tion of the Government's report of unfavorable
crop conditions on May 12 induced considerable
realizing by the short interests. Pressure
against shorts was exerted by reports of a
favorable turn in the anthracite strike situa
tion, but no information on this iwint was
forthcoming. Apparently the liquidation forced
by the more urgent discrimination by money
lenders against collateral was completed yes
terday and there were no such formidable
breaches in the prices of high-grade stocks as
on yesterday, when the feature was a strong
sentimental influence against the market Some
of the wide advances ecored to-day in fact
simply represented sudden recoveries or partial
recoveries from yesterday's severe declines
The money situation was somewhat easier to
day, although loans were made again at as
high as 8 per cent. Buying of stocks for
London account was a strengthening factor in
the market. The lower rate &r money still
ruling abroad makes it profltab. for domestic
buyers of American stocks to purchase Â¦ them
In London and hold them with money bor
rowed there. Yesterday's sharp relapses in
some stocks awakened skepticism as to many
recent rumors of the source of recent demand
for stocks, said to be for control by large
interests. But the Louisville and Nashville
episode and the known character of some of
the recent distribution of Reading among othsr
railroad Interests keep alive the conviction
that there is a tendency toward the lodgment
of stocks in strong hands for control. The
Ftate of suspension of the Northern Securities
case clearly does not prevent the progress of
plans for control, as the question involved
therein is one of method in holdinsr stocks
after they have been secured. A rumor cir
culated to-day, although emphatically denied,
that the Northern Securities interests Intended
to abandon their present plan,- resulted In a
drop in the stock on the curb to 99, which is
its first fall below parity. The stock market
closed dull and firm.
The bond market was dull and somei^hat
irregular. Total sales, par value, $2,.'UO,000.
United States 2Â» and 3s declined % per
cent on the last call.

EASTERN MARKETS.
The only feature of the local market at
present is the condition of the crops. Pears
and Prunes are suffering from blight pretty
much all over' the State and crop estimates of
a month ago are being cut in two. The small
Prunes Just out of the blossom are turning
yellow and dropping off. while the Pear trees
are threatened with disease in several San Joa
quin Valley counties by the strange blight al
ready mentioned. According to the Weather
Bureau report the whole fruit yield of the State
will not be as heavy as expected some weeks
ago and in some sections will turn out short.
Telegrams from Oregon to New York report
serious loss in Prunes by the same blight that
is reported in California.-

The JVcathcr and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie, section
director cf the climate and crop service of the
Weather Sureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weather has been considerably warmer
than during the preceding week, and generally
clear except Tuesday and Wednesday, v.hen
l:t!.i rain fell in the central ar.d northern sec
tions. Light frosts occurred in the vicinity of
Stockton.
Grain and hay are in very poor condition in
the southern part cf the San Jaaquln Valley
and Southern California, and in some places
the early sown grain . is being cut for hay.
Light crops are also probable in some of the
southern coast counties. In the central ar.d
northern parts of the State grain is in excel
lent condition, and in portions of the Sacra
mento Valley the yield of wheat, eats and bar
ley will probably be above average. Haying is
progressing in all sections; hay is reported ex
celient in quality and the yield gen.. rally heavy.
Green feed is plentitul in most places. Sugar
beets, hops end vegetables are making good
growth. â¢
Late reports from Sonoma County Indicate
that prunes have been seriously damaged by
blight, in some localities more seriously than
reported last week, and that the yield will fall
Jar below the average. No reports have been
received from the Santa Ciara Valley. Other
deciduous fruits and vineyards are in excellent
condition, and citrus fruits are doing well.
fcacramer.to Valley. â Warm weather, with
lipht rain at the beginning of the week, bene
fited all crcps. Hay cutting has commenced,
ar.d a heavy crop is being harvested. Winter
wheat is in excellent condition. Oats, bar
ky end early sown wheat were never better
st this season, and heavy crops are expected in
W-tU sections. Green feed is abundannt and of
I excellent quality. Cherries and strawberries
I of superior quality are plentiful at Red Bluff.
The first carload of cherries was shipped East
from Vacaville in express refrigerators Satur
day. Fruit thinning is progressing slowly,
owing to scarcity of labor. Prospects continue
good for heavy crops of all deciduous fruits.
Oranges are in good condition.
Coafct and Bay Sections. â Nearly normal tem
perature has prevailed during the week. Light
ra:n fell in the central and northern sections
Monday and Tuesday. CJraln and hay continue
in excellent condition *s.cept in San Benito
County and adjacent districts, where these
crops are backward and will probably be very
light. Haying continues, &.nd in most places a I
good crop, excellent in quality, is being har- !
vested. The sugar beet crop is well advanced,
and bean planting is progressing in San Luis
Obispo County. A large acreage of corn is be
ing planted in Sonoma County. Hops are mak
vigorous growth. Three special reports on the
prune crou have been received from Sonoma.
County; the report from Santa Rosa says the
yield will be much better than estimated last
wjtek, probably two-thirds of an average crop;
trora Fulton the report reads: "All prunes in
this vicinity euddenly began to turn yellow this
week, and growers expect only one-fourth of a
crop"; at Peachland "the prune crop will be
very short." Prunes are dropping in San Be
nito County. Other deciduous fruits are re
ported in excellent condition.
San Joaquin Valley. â Clear, warm weather
has prevailed during the week, with cool nights
and no rain. Light frosts damaged potatoes
in the vicinity of Stockton. Grain has made
fair growth, but is needing rain badly; reports
from Fresno and Tulare counties state that the
crop will bÂ« very short, owing to lack of rain
Â«ar!y in the season, and in eome places the
grain will not tven make good hay. Barley
is heading out at 3>-l Rey. and grain is ripen
ir.p et Madera. All grains are reported as
filling out very well in Stanislaus County, and
a g-ood yield is probable. Green feed is still |
abundant in most places. Haying In progress- 1
ing. Deciduous fruit prospects are excellent in I
nearly all hections.. though there are reports I
of apricots and peaches dropping in some places.
Orchards and vineyards are being liberally irri
eated.
Southern California. â "Warm, clear weather
during- the week hes been very beneficial to de
ciduous fruits, which are advancing rapidly
and cive indications of a good yield. Orange
ar.d lemon trees are heavily laden with blos
eoms. Walnuts are reported lighter than last
eeason. Early sown grain is being cut for hay
in many places, and unless rain comas very
eoon the crop will be nearly a failure. Late
eraln is in better condition, but needing rain.
A good crop of hay is being liarvested. Pota
toes and Euiar beets are doing well.
Los Angeles summary- â The weather is grad
ually approaching summer conditions. Consid
erable, cloudinesp. but no rain. Navel oranges
are blooming full, and more evenly than for
years.
Eureka summary. â Warm weather with
showers greatly benefited grain and gardens in
rome localities. Corn planting much delayed.
Prospects â¢ for good cror>Â» were never better.
Sheep shearing is in progress.

tions. The chartered wheat fleet in port- has <a
registered tonnage of 23,117. against 26,260 tons
on the same date last year; disengaged. 21,800

250,600 tons, against 174,290. '. .
WHEAT â The Government report,, which ap
pears in the first column, shows a crop condi
tion May 1 considerably below the average. It
indicates a winter Wheat crop of .34.1,500,000
bushels, whereas the April report indicated
415,000.000. The May report shows a falling
off of 100,000,000 bushels from 1901. The report
is considered bullish at Chicago.
Â¦' The foreign markets . showed little change;
The feelingat Chicago was. firm but Inactive.
Outside orders were scarce. The crowd was
bearish but timid on Â¦ the Government report.
Everything was bullish but the market, which
was narrow and professional. Bradstreet's
gave stocks as follows: East of the Rockies,' a
decrease . of 4,134,000 bushels; Europe and
afloat; an increase of . 1,400,000; net decrease,

last observations the crowd, as usual, assumed
that it knew more about the true . condition
than did the Government and paid only pass

selling. There were several dins and re
coveries and July sold under yesterday at
75%@75%c. ' The opinion prevailed for a time
that no one really believed the report and
selling was marked, especially from the North
west. Outside markets spurted early, but
sagged off later and the tendency was for
the market to get back to statistics for its
guide. Receipts were very small. .Bradstreet's

ported rapidly falling off. There was some
rain in the Northwest that helped the tone
somewhat but the" crowd as a whole tot lib
erally short of stuff.- Then came some fair
export business and the crowd got frightened.
It soon appeared that the market was over
sold and prices advanced rapidly as shorts
covered. July gained its top figure again and
closed firm. %c higher, at 70%@70%c.

I/yon's Case Continued.
The case of William Lyons, who con
ducts a saloon at 218 Post street, was
heard before the Police Commissioners
last night. Testimony as to the charac
ter of the place showed it to be of ex
cellent reputation and that no trouble or
disorder whatever/ had occurred about
the place. . _ Â¦Â¦
Arthur Barendt, a reporter employed on
a morning paper, who appeared at the last
meeting of the board as an attorney, and
who presented a petition from business
men against the saloon, had suddenly dis
appeared from the case. Chief Wittman
however, endeavored to subpena all the
men whose names were affixed to the pe
tition, ' but many of - them either dodged
the summons or failed to appear. Those
that did testify said they had no particu
lar objection to Lyons' place, but thought
a ' saloon Interfered with business at any
place. The case was continued one week.
Police Officer Quarles. charged with in
toxication, failed to appear for trial and
was suspended, his 'hearing being set for
4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
They Steal a Very Heavy Pump From
the Mare Island Navy-
Yard.
Oscar Dunlap' and Thomas Boyle were
convicted by a jury yesterday in the Unit
ed States District Court of the crime of
larceny, committed at the Mare Island
Navy Yard. Third Assistant United States
Attorney Ben L. McKinley conducted the
prosecution. The evidence was that the
prisoners took off a float attached to the
training ship Independence, a handy billy
pump weighing 175 pounds and a quantity
of suction hose, all belonging to the Gov
ernment. They were making for the Val
lejo shore when they were pursued by
the master-at-arms of the Independence.
Being closely pressed they dumped the
pump overboard in shallow water. They
showed fight but were overcome and ar
rested by the master-at-arms and the
Chief of Police of Vallejo. There was
practically no defense, and the jurors
without , leaving their seats, returned a
verdict of guilty. Â«

City Hall Telephone System.
Louis Glass, vice president of the Paqlfic
States Telephone Company, Informed the
Board of Supervisors yesterday that the
total cost of installing a private exchange
telephone system for the City Hall will
be $3378, exclusive of the telephones which
must be rented at the special rates al
lowed the city. ,
Owing to the fact that yesterday was
collection day there was no session of the
Grand Jury. A quorum^did not put in an
appearance at the rooms. In response to
the subpenas almost all the Supervisors
reported at the jury's chambers, but they
made their visit in vain. The Maypr did
not attend in person, but he sent his sec
retary to make an excuse for his absence,
as he had gone out with Harriman and
Governor Odell.

Legal Lights Axguo Question of Le-
The demurrer to the suit of the city
and county against the Pacific States Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company was ar
gued before Judge Seawell yesterday and
submitted for decision. The suit is
brought by the city to recover $29,000
claimed to be due on a license of $2 per
quarter levied on 14,500 telephones under
ordinance 15S9.
Attorney Alfred Sutro argued on behalf
of the telephone company and Attorney
Brobeck, from the office of the City At
torney, spoke for the municipality.
Sutro claimed that the nickel dropped
in the telephone box did not beget ser
vice, as it acted simply as a signal. For
this reason, said Sutro, the telephone
company should not be taxed for Its
nickel-in-the-slot telephones.
Brobeck argued at length in opposition
to Sutro's contentions. He said that he
was seeking the enforcement of an obli
gation empowered by law. Referring to
the signal part of Sutro's argument, he
said the nickel might give the signal, but
it is upon this signal that service is ren
dered.
ATTORNEY SAYS NICKEL
ACTS ONLY AS SIGNAL
Civil Service Commission. Gets Face
tious With Police Commissioners
Over. One of Their Selections.
The Civil Service Commissioners no-'
titled the Board of Police Commissioners
yesterday that it disapproves of the ap
pointment of George F. Kelly as matron.
Kelly is the photographer of the Police
Department, jj and in the notification to
the commission of his appointment his
name was written opposite the word
"matron"â evidently a clerical error. In
a communication to the Police Board
Secretary Edward F. Moran of the com
mission says:
While this commission believes that your
honorable body has made due Inquiry as to
the ability, of- your appointee to fulfill the
many and ' various duties of the position to
which you have appointed him, and while we
have no reason to doubt that said appoint
ment was made in all good faith, we yet feel
constrained to refuse our approval of the se
lection of Mr. Kelly as matron, and hereby
assign the following reasons therefor:
1 â Under rule 24 of this commission, to
which you are respectfully referred, "the duties
of the position to be filled, rather than the
name by which it is called," shall be consid
ered in filling requisitions. As we know of no
duties attaching to the position of matron, ex
cept those usually performed by. persons whose
positions are properly dignified by that respect-*
ed title, we. perforce, dissent from the ap
pointment of a person whose abilities to prop
erly. perform, the duties . of - the office, have not
been fully demonstrated,- and of whose quali
fications, notwithstanding ' the action of your
honorable board, there is , a lingering doubt in
the minds of this commission.
In disapproving | the appointment of j your
appointee, we do not desire to- cast any re
flection upon his personality. "We are officially
advised, and therefore believe, that *he ap
pearance of the appointee may have' led your
honorable board, unwittingly. Into error. We
are informed that this appointee is of a grave,
sedute and matron-like manner, of. full habit
and smooth and beardless face. Moreover, we
understand, ho is addicted in an extreme de
gree to many arts in which matrons must de
light, such as ping-pong and crocheting, and Is
withal of a most delightful and versatile
genius.. It is said, however, that he is ad
dicted to a habit which alone should debar
him from appointment to the position In which
you seek to place him. In brief, it is charged
that your appointee chews plug tobacco, with
out removing the tin plugs. . To this idiosyn
crasy this commission makes most positive ob
jection.
WILL NOT APPROVE KELLY'S
APPODJTMENT AS A MATRON
Dublin and Leitrim Give Entertain-
ment and Are Ably Assisted
by the Hibernians.
Dublin and Leitrim booths had charge
of the entertainment last night at the
Irish Fair and the natives of both coun
ties crowded the pavilion in honor of the
occasion. Professor Allen's band ren
dered its customary fine programme and
the affair was voted a great success.
The Ancient Order of Hibernians as
sembled . at their hall. 120 Ninth street,
and marched to the pavilion in a , body.
They took part In the festivities and min

booths. They were the special guests of
the ladies of Dublin and Lietrim, and
were charmingly entertained.
George P. Morgan gave an interesting
exhibition of burlesque skating at Ty
rone booth. He did some clever tricks
and was loudly applauded by the spec
tators.
All the attractions were well patronized
by the visitors who attended the fair last
night and the evening was one
of the most successful since the
opening. A merry contest is going
on to decide who As the most popu
lar young lady of the many .different
booths. The contest Is waxing fast and
furious and much rivalry exists between
the fair candidates.
To-night is reserved for the County
Kerry celebration and there Is great hus
tle and bustle to make it an event that
will surpass anything yet given during
the fair. â¢ Mrs. Galvin will have charge
and with her many assistants she has
been faithfully working to arrange a
fitting celebration.
The Hackmen's Union met last night
and voted, to take 400 tickets for the
Irish fair. â¢ A committee was appointed
to Induce all the labor unions to send
delegates to the fair on labor night,
Wednesday, May 22.*

BATHER PECULIAR WILL
IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 13.-Hattie De.
laro Barnes, the divorced wife of a son
of General W. H. L. Barnes of San Fran
cisco, according to statements made
here, is the central figure in a breach of
promise case, and a suit for money al
leged to have, been loaned, brought in
the Federal court against Clyde Shrop
shire, a Salt Lake lawyer.
Shropshire, who came to this city re
cently from Kentucky, was formerly
United States Vice Consul in France, and
the testimony taken to-day deals with the
life he led there after meeting with the
actress who brings the suit. Mrs. Barnes
is widely known through her portrayal of
Madge in the play "In Old Kentucky,"
and through her appearance on the
vaudeville stage with a pickaninny band.
She declared that Shropshire promised
to marry her. To soothe , her grief - and
disappointment over his marrying an
other woman she asks 550,000. She also
wants something over $2000 for money she
says she loaned him. On the stand she
swore that together they plunged into the
Paris social swirl when he was Vice
Consul there in 1S97. She said she helped
pay the bills, and for this purpose was
at times obliged to pawn her jewelry.
They traveled over the United States to
gether, she said, and were supposed to
be husband and wife. . :
Shropshire testified that he tasted the
cup of gayety In Paris with her, but that
he paid her everything she loaned him
and more. He said that he desired ito
leave her, but that she has pursued him
over two continents with threats of ex
posure if he did not keep on giving her
money. The trial of the two cases will
last several days.
â¢ L. P. Matkin, who lives at 2572 Lombard
street, was shot in the left hand last
evening while' trying to prevent George
Martin from killing the latter's sister,
Mrs. Maria Dorfler. The shooting took
place at Martin's residence. 907 Harrison
street. Martin was taken into custody by
Policeman: P. . Sullivan and a charge of
assault to murder was placed against
him. Matkin declined to prosecute Mar
tin, as he did not deem his injuries of
any magnitude. Mrs. Dorfler' was 'of .a
different mind, however, as she went to
the City "Prison and mad; the charge on
which her -brother was arrested.
Mrs. Dorfler -etated that her brother had
often threatened to kill her and but for
the timely presence of Matkin he might
have carried out his intention.
Martin had been drinking heavily for
the last week and about 6:30 last evening
he rushed into the room where Mrs. Dor
fler and Matkin were seated and yelled,
"I've come to kill you," but before he
could carry the threat into execution
Matkin grappled with him. During the
struggle the pistol went off and the bul T
let plowed through (Matkin's hand.
When Martin saw* what he had done he
dropped- the pistol and tried to make his
escape. He rushed out of a side entrance
into, the street, but was pointed out to
Officer Sullivan by those attracted by the
shot. . i
Matkin went to a drug store at Sixth
and.Folsom streets and had his wounds
dressed. He there identified Martin as
the man who did the shooting.
It appears that Martin Is part owner in
a piece of property occupied by himself
and sister. Every month he Is given his
share of the proceeds from the rental of
the building and immediately spends it
for liquor. He was arrested a few months
ago for vagrancy and was given sixty
days. He has been in the habit of scar
ing his sister by telling her he would kill
her and then end his own life. /
The troubles of the local unions of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners and the Building Trades Coun
cil remain unsettled. The master builS
ers are greatly worried at <he outlook
and a masc-meeting of contractors will
bo held to-night for the purpose of de
vising ways and means for the settlement
of the controversy.
It was rumored last night that the
plumbers had announced their intention
to support the carpenters in their fight
against the - Building Trades Council.
Owing to the fact that the carpenters
of the unions which remain loyal to the
council are being called off dally by
business agents the plumbers have been
losing considerable time during the last
two; weeks and they are making loud
complaints in consequence. A committee
of plumbers met last night and consid
ered the advisability of withdrawing from
the Building Trades Council entirely and
tnus show their sympathy for the broth
erhood carpenters in their tight.
The news of the probable action of the
plumbers has lillea the unions of the
Droiherhood with joy. On the other
hand the Building Trades Council- re
gards the situation one of extreme grav
ity. Should the plumbers carry out their
idea, as they probably will, the Building
.Trades Council will practically lose â¢ its
fight.: â¢ I
UNIONS AiRE LOYAL.
At a meeting of the new district coun
cil of the brotherhood last night reports
were received stating that the plumbers,
plasterers, painters . and lathers now af
filiated with .the Building Trades Coun
cil absolutely refuse to quit work when
ordered to do so by agents of the coun
cil because brotherhood carpenters are
working on their jobs. The men of these
crafts say that they are well satisfied
to work with brotherhood men and they
decline to submit to loss of time and
money at the dictation of men who hava
nothing but prestige to lose in the light
now being wagetr. The promises of sup
port received from all quarters have
greatly encouraged the brotherhood men
to remain firm. '
Resolutions of sympathy and support
were received from many out of town
unions, including No. 194 of Alameda,
No. 162 of San Mateo, No. 352 of Los An
geles, No. 642 of Eastyard, No. 66$ of
Palo Alto and No. 751 of Santa Rosa. All
of the unions mentioned roundly de
nounced P.- H. McCarthy, president of
the Building Trades Council, as being re
sponsible for the troubles in which the
carpenters are involved.
STRIKE OF THE TANNEBS.
The strike of the tanners In the empioy
of Poetsch & Peterson remains unsettled.
A committee of the union visited the tan
nery yesterday and formally presented
the demands of the striking employes for
an increase of wages to the amount of
25 cents a day. The proprietors took the
matter under advisement and informed
the committee that they would reach a
decision later in the week. - ' .
The firm in question is utilizing the
time in putting in new boilers and in im
proving the plant. Poetsch said last
night that he was willing to meet the
men half way, but that he could not say
he favored granting the demand as made.
He was in favor of establishing a piece
work system, by which the capable men'
would, earn more than they are now ask
ing, for.- A., plan to that effect will be
presented to the strikers at the next con
ference.
The total number of men out on strike
is forty-eight. It was rumored In labor
circles last night that the employes of
other tanneries are contemplating making
similar demands. If the - strike of
Poetsch & Peterson's men is successful
other strikes are likely to be inaugurated.
CABMEN" NOT SATISFIED.
At a largely attended meeting of Divi
sion No. 205 of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation of Street Railway Employes of
America held last night at 117 Turk
street the main topic of discussion was
the new timetables issued by the United
Railroads. Considerable dissatisfaction
was | expressed about some of the new
time cards, which enabled the men to
earn but $2 25 a day and less. A letter
drafted by the executive committee and
presented to the grievance committee,
requesting a change of timetables so
that the regular men can earn $2 50 a
day was unanimously indorsed.
The hospital question was fully gone
into and the whole matter was referred
back to the . executive committee to re
port at. next meeting. The sentiment ex
pressed after several members and Sec
retary Rosenberg of the Labor Council
had advised the carmen was to stick to
the hours and wage question, leaving the
minor matters for the future.

For running over the tail of a yellow
dog H. B. Lazerlere, a well known society
man of this city, is being prosecuted in
the Police Court of Sausalito Township.
The crime is of such magnitude that the
friends of the dog have engaged leading
counsel to prosecute the cruel defendant,
and the friends of the latter have clubbed
together and hired Judge James Lang
home to save him. The trial will be held
to-morrow night, and it promises to be
a "cause celebre."
It appears from the complaint in the
hands of the Town Marshal that Mr.
Lazerlere, "with malice aforethought,"
ran an automobile laden with precious
freight over the tall of aforesaid yellow
dog, disturbing its peace of mind and
lacerating its feelings, all of which was
contrary to the- peace and dignity of Sau
salito Township; that' said Lazerlere was
negligent in handling the horseless car
riage and "auto" have known better than
to disturb the siesta of a dog sunning it
self in the roadway, even though said
dog is mongrel in breed and yellow in
color.
In answering the complaint filed by the
friends of the yellow dog Mr. Lazerlere
sets up a cross-complaint, in which he al
leges at great length that he is not at
fault and entitled to damages for arrest,
false imprisonment and injury to his feel-,
ings. .->.... .
In the answer Mr. Lazerlere admits
having' run over the dog's tail, but denies
this gave palp to said mongrel or lacer
sited its feelings, but on the contrary con
stituted an act of charity in removing
a superfluous part of its caudal append
age, as it would save It suffering from
hydrophobia or other "Ills that yellow
dogs are heir to." â¢
For a separate cause of action defend
ant Lazerlere sets up the following state
ment 0"f facts:
"That A. B. Costlsan. Cflauda Terry
Hamilton, Robert P. Greer and defendant.
H. B. Lazerlere journeyed to Sausallto in
an automobile last Saturday for the pur
pose of aiding the members of the Episco
pal church In conducting a fair. Patrons
of the fair were whisked around town at
5 cents a 'whisk,' and it- was on one of
these trips that defendant crossed the
yellow dog; that certain habitues of the
poolroctns, having enmity for the order
loving people of the township, incited the
arrest and prosecution of himself- "that
his arrest caused him great trouble, as
his friends were compelled to expend $10
bail money to secure his release from
durance vile; that said arrest and attend
ant trouble caused himself and friends to
miss the incoming Sausalito boat, on
which were certain well known society
ladies who had been invited to attend a
house party at the 'Hutch/ said 'Hutch'
being the name of defendant's country
residence; that said ladies were compelled
to wait in a draughty depot until defend
ant and his friends could pilot them to a
more congenial spot. All of which dis
turbed his peace of mind â¢ and damaged
him to the extent of untold dollars "
The courtroom will be far, too small to
accommodate the crowd " expected to at
tend the .trial. \

The interest that has been excited in this unique sale of shoes
is not surprising.
The conditions under which we sell this season's smartest shoes
as though they were remnants are unusual. Rarely' in the history of
a city does a case Hke this occur, t . .â¢
The prices we're charging during this sale are suspiciously low.
If there were not some extraordinary reason no one would believe
that we could sell Burt & Packard and other famous models, in the
latest 1902 styles, just after we had received them, for almost nothing.
But the reason is as logical as it is unusual. We have just ef-
fected a reorganization of our business. We are going to open the
Sorosis Shoe Parlors on Post street, where we will conduct a
uniquely luxurious establishment on the scale of the "Sorosis" stores
of New York, London. Paris and Berlin. In this new store every-
thing must be "Sorosis." We cannot carry our present lines of shoes
. over there. : 'Â¦. '.'Â¦Â¦
This leaves us with the task of disposing of some of the swellest
lines of shoes that were purchased in this city for the seasons of
1902.
Therefore we offer bargains such as were never offered in San
Francisco before â that could not possibly be offered under ordinary
I conditions. A visit to our store will convince you of the truth of
